jimmy , let me tell you something . don &apos;t worry about what i know .
i was just over to tony &apos;s house .
oh , yeah ? how was he ?
he looked ...
... tired .
maybe he &apos;s got hypoglycemia .
maybe he &apos;s depressed .
what &apos;s he depressed about ?
he talked to me about it .
depression ?
well ....
what do you know about depression ?
nothing , but he sleeps all the time , he &apos;s not taking care of himself .
top guys have dark moods .
winston churchill drank a quart of brandy before breakfast .
and napoleon , he was a moody fuck too .
am i nuts ?
a day at the mall in mules and i &apos;ll be crippled for life .
i told lilliana to put some giambotto in the microwave for you .
how are you fixed for sweat socks ? we &apos;ll be by the sports authority .
tony ?
i know you &apos;re in there ! i know you hear me !
will you let me sleep ?
does your therapist know about this ? maybe you need more medication .
she &apos;s got me on lithium and prozac . what else ?
aromatherapy , something .
this is not normal ...
... for a healthy adult male to take to bed like this .
i got a lot on my mind .
oh , really ? well , move over , then .
those indictments are hanging over my head too .
plus i got the roots in the pipe to the street .
my best friend , pussy , has disappeared . he &apos;s probably fucking dead , okay ?
this downturn started long before pussy bompensiero disappeared .
if you want me , i will be at the paramus mall ...
... getting your son a suit to wear to his first formal .
carmela , come on !
sunlight is good for people .
in alaska , they wear little light hats so they don &apos;t get depressed .

what am i saying at this poor woman &apos;s wake ?
i wanted to let you know so you don &apos;t worry .
everything &apos;s taken care of about tony .
when i was a little kid like that ...
... i always used to wonder why nobody collected prayer cards ...
... like they collect baseball cards .
thousands of bucks for honus wagner ...
... and jack shit for jesus .
it &apos;s going down at a newsstand by the medical center .
where he spills his guts on some fucking shrink &apos;s carpet .

donnie paduana did time with them at rahway . and i was very specific .
he &apos;s not gonna suffer . he &apos;ll have an open casket , i promise .
enough ! i don &apos;t want to hear anymore !
jesus , michael , if i delegate , i delegate .
is that what time it is ?
there is absolutely nothing on the street about the big guy , anywhere .
i went to see his family .
angela doesn &apos;t know shit , or she deserves an academy fucking award .
his goomar either .
i don &apos;t wanna hear no more talking about pussy .
mr. tony , let me take that robe and wash it for you .
did i ask you to take the robe ?
jimmy altieri was in the bing .
can &apos;t even look him in the face anymore .
if he &apos;s wired , it &apos;s doing jack shit ...
... because all we feed him is deliberate bullshit ...
... till we can , you know ....
don &apos;t do nothing about jimmy .
i don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s the guy that flipped .
i don &apos;t know nothing no more .
pussy probably freaked out and he &apos;s lamming it , that &apos;s all .
how many times do i gotta say it ?

i already talked to them . i realize it &apos;s urgent .
i heard tony &apos;s own mother wants him popped .

i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s just a joke .
you think that &apos;s funny , a guy &apos;s own mother ?
tomorrow !

i &apos;m not a friend to my friends . i &apos;m nothing .
i don &apos;t even know why i come here .
nothing else to do .
do you think it would help if you went someplace to rest up a while ?
you mean like vegas ?
no , not vegas .
a place where you &apos;d be looked after .
like a hospital ?
with padded rooms and straitjackets ?
no . no straitjackets .
a residential treatment center .
any idea what my life would be worth ...
... if people knew i was in a laughing academy ?
your life is boxing us in .
i &apos;ll take a gun and blow my head off .
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying , you should be hospitalized .
oh , yeah ?

my grandfather was a stonemason . he was avellinese , him and his brother .
you should visit avellino if your family come from there .
there isn &apos;t too much left because of the many earthquake .
but from the 17th century , is still there a beautiful palazzo .
palazzo della dogana .
and there is a place in the corner of the piazza ...
... a wine bar . you can sit . you can see the hills .
and when is spring ...
... you can smell the blossom from the lemon trees .
and there is a church with a bell .
and they say when it rings , that means that a baby ...
... was conceived in the town .
tony ?
tony ?

... and you came and took me to that dance ...
... and used that kind of talk ...
... i &apos;d slap your face !
that &apos;s right , ma . thank you .

here we go .
how come my son &apos;s in a bathrobe ? is he sick ?
he &apos;s fine .
dad , you &apos;re depressed .
depressed ?
my father came to this country with 17 cents in his pocket ...
... and he never made a peep .
ma ?
what &apos;s he got to be depressed about ?
nobody threw him into the glue factory ...
... and sold his house out from underneath him .
we all agreed to sell your home .
i &apos;m going back upstairs .
i was making a joke !
i suppose it would be better if i never opened my mouth .
how can it be a joke if you &apos;re crying ?
this is really the last time .
i am never coming back to this house .
what a day ! with this wind , huh ?
what you looking at ?
nothing .
who &apos;s she ?
dental student , from italy .
you know her ?
we had lunch .
lunch ?
you fucking piece of shit .
going to dinner with you is a distant memory for me ...
... but you have time to take her to lunch ?
you &apos;re sinking this whole family into your misery with your complaining ...
... while i spoon @-@ feed you and bathe you !
a half @-@ inch of another woman &apos;s thigh gets you out of bed ?
what am i , a fucking idiot ?
if i had an ounce of self @-@ respect , i would cut your dick off !
i was there last night for dinner .
i couldn &apos;t go .
those poor freaking kids .
they barely have a father now . you should see him at the dinner table .
i don &apos;t want to know .
in his bathrobe at 7 p.m.
some bargain . that &apos;s all anyone should pay .
my cousin , cakey , after his lobotomy , looked exactly like my son .
livia .

better cakey die than live like that . that &apos;s what his mother used to say .
don &apos;t talk about it anymore . don &apos;t talk about tony . it &apos;s done .
mr. tony , miss carmela said to tell you she went to buy a suit for a.j.
go away .
okay , mister . miss carmela told me to remind you of your appointment .
how &apos;s you doing , tony ? pick six today ?
no , just an orange juice and a racing form today .
this wind , huh ?
yeah .
dead now , motherfucker !
oh , shit !
daddy ! where is he ? please let him be all right !
they didn &apos;t say anything ?
they didn &apos;t .
look who &apos;s here .
is he all right ? jesus christ , tony !
your ear &apos;s all bloody ! what &apos;d they do to your ear ?
i &apos;m putting in stitches to create a nice closure .
we were so scared .
they almost killed you for a car !
guess nobody told them about the gas mileage it gets .
it &apos;s not funny , dad .
what &apos;s the matter ? forget how to talk because i got banged up ?
no .
he &apos;s just frightened , that &apos;s all .
doctor needs to finish up here , ma &apos;am .
all right . let &apos;s give the doctor some room .
see you later .
poor dad .
he &apos;ll be all right .
christ !
you can &apos;t wait until they finish sewing my ear back on ?
one inch to the left and you &apos;re in a drawer instead of talking to me .
who &apos;s talking to you ?
what &apos;s he doing here ?
agent harris is just leaving .
we &apos;re offering your husband full immunity ...
... in return for his testimony .
relocate you and your family , you &apos;ll be completely safe .
don &apos;t talk to my wife .
he wouldn &apos;t have to go to jail ?
carmela , ask this prick if i &apos;m even indicted .
this assassination problem is not going to go away .
i told you to stop talking to my wife !
carmela , will you wait outside ?
kiss my ass , tony !
we &apos;re your only option ,
tony . it &apos;s not safe for you anymore .
this conversation &apos;s over .
what do you know ?
he knows nothing . it was a carjacking !
now get out of here ! you &apos;re upsetting my wife !
in case you change your mind .
you know he &apos;s right .
nothing will happen .
wake up , tony ! it already did !
i took an oath , carmela .
are you a kid in a tree house ?
did you tell anybody about me seeing melfi ?
that &apos;s why they tried to kill you , because you see a psychiatrist ?
it was a carjacking !
have the decency not to lie to me .
what do you want to do , carmela ? move to utah ?
be mr. and mrs. mike smith ?
we could sell indian relics . maybe start a rattlesnake ranch .
this is our chance to get out , tony . we could start a whole new life .
have some mormons over to dinner . eat some tomatoes with no taste .
i want those kids to have a father .
they got one . this one .
me . tony soprano . and all that comes with it .
oh , you prick !
good .
i can &apos;t go to that dance now either .
god , self @-@ involved much ?
it &apos;s uncle silvio and uncle paulie .
hey , squirt !
they shot my dad .
he &apos;s all right , though , isn &apos;t he ?
take more than a jamaican bobsled team with cap guns to stop him .
where is he ?
with mom .
all right .
they look kind of weird .
i don &apos;t believe it was a carjacking .
today in montclair , anthony soprano ...
... who allegedly is a captain in the northern new jersey mafia ...
... was wounded in what he claims was an attempted carjack .
but sources in the fbi say it was a gangland execution gone awry .
soprano escaped with minor wounds and was taken to an undisclosed hospital .
one of his assailants , william &quot; petite &quot; clayborn ...
... was killed in the attack .
continuing now with ...
is this true ?
do you think they made it up ?
but how could this happen ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t frigging know .
i feel like i &apos;m floating in space . he &apos;ll look for who did this .
anthony ? of course he is !
you understand what &apos;s going on ?
my son got shot and he got away !
what do we do now ? what the fuck do we do now , livia ?
we go see him .
tony ?
of course !
he &apos;s my only son .
thanks , sweetheart .
we could use some peppers out here .
i &apos;ll get them .
don &apos;t you have homework to do ?
i can &apos;t help too ?
some fucking shit , huh ?
tony ! jesus fucking christ !
who do we blame for the hat ?
i was on denny najarian &apos;s boat .
two shooters , and his piece was under the seat .
you believe it ?
two girls from the &apos; hood , that &apos;s all .
do we know who they are ?
the live one took off in a taurus .
taurus ?
yeah .
moolies in a new taurus . doesn &apos;t exactly fit the profile .
motherfuck ! these guys i had a beef with at the newsstand .
you were there ?
the day before yesterday .
the newsstand ? the one in montclair ?
yeah , i was in the neighborhood .
what were you doing there ?
taking my mother to the doctor .
hey , put it right there , baby .
thank you .
this husband of yours , carmela . how much we love him .
he &apos;s the best .
come on .
he &apos;s like a father to me .
just make sure nothing happens to him .
i &apos;ll get it .
come on .
all due respect , tone ...
... it had to be your uncle , right ?
well , why fucking now ?
maybe he found out .
found out what ?
that he &apos;s joe jerk @-@ off , not the boss . that you run things behind his back .
anthony !
uncle jun !
don &apos;t get up . i heard your knee was fucked up .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m all right .
your ear &apos;s disfigured .
it &apos;s all right .
hi .
mikey and my crew are cracking heads to find out who did this .
when we &apos;re done with them they &apos;re gonna wish they were never born .
look who it is . father intintola !
i came as a friend .
how are you , tony ?
all right .
if you &apos;d like to speak privately we could kneel in prayer or ...
not right now .
why don &apos;t you grab a sandwich and we &apos;ll talk later ?
you &apos;re sleeping over , right ?
can i get you anything ?
another sambuca ?
i &apos;ll get it .
i &apos;ll take a curacao , if you got it . i &apos;ll buy him one too .
no , that &apos;s all right . no alcohol for me .
can he hear through that ear ?
ma , sit down . here you go . have something to eat .
want some ?
fuck , i thought it was him .
but there he is , glasses and all .
don &apos;t eat capocollo , grandma . it &apos;s all fat .
capocollo ? over here !
right there .
who is that ?
who ?
that girl .
who , meadow ?
is that concetta ?
it &apos;s your granddaughter . meadow ?
all right , don &apos;t get impatient . i &apos;m your mother !
did you hear ? dad fought off two black guys . one got shot .
why aren &apos;t you dressed for the dance ?
i can &apos;t go .
why not ?
don &apos;t you need me here ?
and disappoint the future miss new jersey ?
mom was gonna drive . she can &apos;t now .
you &apos;re gonna go .
i gotta know something .
and i want the truth .
did you ever tell anybody about you and me ?
i may have mentioned to my family ...
i had a patient who was in trouble with something ...
... we were hearing about in the news .
i never mentioned a name or any other specifics ...
... that could identify you as that person .
my son &apos;s .
does your family know ?
my mother &apos;s made a few comments . but i don &apos;t see how she knows .
and even if she did ....
even go there about the old lady .
you should &apos;ve seen her at my house . she was losing her mind .
how are you doing with all of this ?
i feel pretty good .
really ?
yeah .
well , that &apos;s good .
talk about a jolt to the system .
try getting shot at .
it &apos;ll give you a nice kick start .
you know , when i was depressed ...
... i said i didn &apos;t want to live .
well , i tell you something .
i didn &apos;t want to die .
every fucking particle of my being was fighting to live .
i had lunch with that girl next door .
you did ?
lsabella .
she was telling me about ...
... avellino , where my people are from .
it sounded nice .
anyway , she was talking ...
... and then all of a sudden ...
... we went to another place , like ...
... in my mind &apos;s eye .
i don &apos;t know , we went back in time to , like , 1907 or something .
and we were in this room , me and her .
and she was holding a baby on her breast . she was nursing it .
she was whispering to it , like , &quot; it &apos;s okay , little baby .
don &apos;t cry . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i love you . &quot;
did the baby have a name ?
she was calling it antonio .
anthony , your fantasy ...
... that &apos;s you , that little baby .
and lsabella , that she was nursing you .
fuck me .
you think this is a stretch ?
can we get some of that whiskey ?
livia .
you don &apos;t knock ? i could &apos;ve been in the nude !
what the hell is going on ?
see if my slipper is over there .
fuck your slipper !
i don &apos;t like that talk !
was that bullshit yesterday ?
you don &apos;t even recognize your granddaughter ?
i &apos;ve been forgetting things lately .
you &apos;ll find that it &apos;ll happen to you soon too .
terrific timing , after the move on your son is in the toilet !
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !

lsabella . haven &apos;t seen her in a couple days .
your houseguest , lsabella . dark hair , beautiful .
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying ?

no !
i think i &apos;ve said enough about it . i never threatened to cut your dick off .
hello ?
yeah , it &apos;s your patient .
the one who &apos;s been involved in the news lately ?
i gotta talk to you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
there was no lsabella .
what ?
there was no lsabella . i just talked to cusamano ...
... he just got back from bermuda .
i asked , &quot; where &apos;s the dental student ? &quot;
he looked at me like i was pazzo .
but you said that your wife saw her , that you argued about it .
yeah , i asked her about that .
and ?
you thought she was pissed then ?
you should see her now that i said it was a fantasy .
discontinue the lithium .
i already flushed it .
even if it was the medicine , this fantasy of yours has meaning .
you know , the issue of mother and child . the madonna .
you didn &apos;t see this broad .
did you ever flirt or come on sexually with isabella ?
no .
why not ?
you said she was very beautiful and voluptuous .
another question :
why now ?
what ?
why the need ...
... for the fantasy of a loving woman now ?
i don &apos;t know .
come in .
we can talk face to face .
i can &apos;t right now .
your mother is always talking about infanticide .
it &apos;s a sad situation in the world .
do you still feel okay ?
i feel pretty good , actually .
