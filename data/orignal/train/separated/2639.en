第二季 第二十二集
The owner is Anton Velov.
My belief is he's the C.I.
We pulled all the receipts.
And found a late dinner for two
paid for by a Leo Andropov.
I got a phone call from an agent
named Elizabeth Keen.
She was asking about Katarina Rostova.
Tom Connolly's been leaking information to the Cabal
about everything that goes on in this place.
You will ignore Reddington's lead.
Tell them intel indicates the Russian is at Union Station.
You've been set up. You infected the senator.
You need to get out of there now.
Senator Hawkins remains in critical condition...
...after being infected by what authorities describe
as a biological agent.
...a staggering development
as it appears connected to te
deaths of the 14 C.I.A. agents.
I'm being framed.
Yes, and by the end of the day,
they'll identify you by name.
Anyone could have infected Hawkins.
He must have shaken dozens of hands at that memorial.
Within hours, they will all have tested negative for the virus.
You can't know that. This is insane.
Lizzy, you walked into the director's office
and played him the Fulcrum.
You are the enemy.
They're crawling over every place
you've ever lived and worked,
every file and hard drive like fire ants on a grasshopper.
They won't find anything.
That'll suit their purposes just fine.
Anything they do find, they'll erase
so they can say you destroyed evidence
to hide your involvement in the plot.
And when they eventually restore what few pieces
they do want to be found,
they will not be kind to you.
You need to get out.
If I run, it'll only make me look guilty.
I'll be playing right into their hands.
You're already in their hands.
The only thing they haven't done is closed their fist.
Go. Now. I'll be there in three minutes.
No. They can't prove I did anything wrong.
They can call me a criminal,
but I'm not gonna act like one.
Where is Elizabeth Keen?
Harold, a warrant has been issued for her arrest.
Anyone hiding her will be charged
with aiding and abetting a terrorist,
including you.
You used me.
You wanted me to know Karakurt was posing as a reporter.
You wanted me to tell Keen where to intercept Hawkins.
I don't know how this helps you, framing an F.B.I. agent.
Nobody will believe she's an assassin.
She was at OREA when it blew up.
So were dozens of others.
Yes, but I'll bet that
only her prints are found on the truck bomb.
She'll also test positive for the virus
that killed Senator Hawkins.
He's not dead.
Yet.
You won't get away with it.
Keen is a distinguished agent.
Yes, and the daughter of a Russian KGB asset.
She failed to mention that, did she?
Agent Keen's been hiding secrets from you --
secrets that clearly implicate her
as an enemy of this country.
She was handpicked by a notorious fugitive
to assist in expanding his criminal empire.
The two of them have been using this task force
to do Reddington's bidding.
And before you tell me that's crazy,
can you really tell me that isn't true?
I will never help you do this.
I don't need your help, Harold.
A simple blood test from Agent Keen
will be as compelling as a signed confession.
The entire area around St. Agnes has been quarantined,
and individuals who might have been exposed, as well,
have been detained inside the church.
You have no legal authority to hold us here.
Senator, I understand you're upset,
but we need everyone's full cooperation.
People are saying Hawkins was infected with some sort of virus.
You think we're infected?
Probably not, but that's why we set up a mobile lab.
You don't have probable cause to hold us.
You really want a U.S. senator
claiming wrongful arrest and imprisonment?
Hey, someone just tried
to assassinate a colleague of yours.
Nobody's going anywhere.
But when we're done here, if you want to file
a complaint or a lawsuit, be my guest.
Until then, get back in the line.
What have you found on the feeds?
We've been looking at surveillance feeds
from the moment he arrived until the moment he collapsed.
We've rounded up everyone he came into contact with.
Which means the killer's in this room.
I've assigned to Reven Wright
to oversee the investigation of Agent Keen.
I'm confident she'll follow the facts.
Those facts are not proven.
If you don't want to help us, that's fine,
but I'm sure I don't need to remind you
what will happen if you actively stand in our way.
You'll be charged with perjury in the harbormaster case
and leaking privileged grand jury proceedings.
And then there's Charlene.
You need to leave now.
As for the clinical trial,
I can't imagine that will continue.
Did you hear what I said?
You can take your pills and your clinical trial.
I would rather die than be part of this.
Escort Director Cooper to his car.
I'm placing him on administrative leave
until we're finished here.
And find Elizabeth Keen.
There must be some mistake.
That's what I thought. We ran the samples twice.
Everyone here tested negative for the virus.
We missed something.
I have Hawkins on camera
from the moment he stepped out of the car
to the moment he collapsed.
Every single person he came into contact with tested negative.
All except one.
You were right.
It's all set up.
Cooper and Connolly -- I heard them arguing.
He's got it all figured out.
He's presenting evidence, using my mother,
making it seem like all I've been doing
is helping you commit crimes.
Lizzy, are you out?
I'm leaving now.
Dembe's on his way.
As soon as you're out, find your way to Illinois and Ridge.
He'll be there waiting.
Yeah.
Hello, Agent Keen.
We've been looking for you.
I want the chain of custody
for that sample fully accounted for,
and I want someone from my task force
to oversee the process and confirm the results.
Suspects don't get to dictate process, Agent Keen.
You need to listen to me. I'm being framed.
You left the OREA building minutes before it was bombed.
Yes, and so did my partner!
At no point was I ever anywhere near that truck!
Maybe not that morning,
but your partial prints were on the device.
That's not possible.
We'll get you the report.
I'm sure that's what the report says,
because, as I told you, I'm being framed.
Okay, Agent Keen, who exactly is setting you up?
'Cause from where I sit,
they're doing a damn good job of it.
There's an organization known as the Cabal --
a conspiracy formed by world leaders
from the government to the private sector.
Conspiracy? Really?
Tom Connolly -- that's who you should be questioning.
Cut the crap. We know who you are.
Where were you born?
I was raised in Nebraska.
That's not what I asked. You were born in Moscow.
Your mother was a KGB agent
named Katarina Rostova.
Your adopted father had a criminal past
you failed to mention.
What is your birth name?
What?
Your birth name?
For most people, that's a pretty simple question.
I never knew my biological parents,
and my memories were... blocked.
You expect us to believe that?
I don't care what you believe.
Intel indicates the existence
of a Russian sleeper agent within the FBI.
Then maybe you should go out and look for him.
We know the truth, Masha.
That's your real name, isn't it?
Masha Rostova.
Answer the question, Agent Keen.
Tell you what. Let's back up.
You wanted to see me?
Let's go back to OREA - the bombing.
We know -- - I just received word.
Senator Hawkins is dead.
There's no evidence the man we're holding is Karakurt.
Main Justice verified his credentials.
He's just a reporter. Maybe Cooper could --
Agent Cooper was relieved of duty by the Attorney Ggeneral
until my inquiry is complete.
This is unbelievable.
So they're taking him out, too.
Look, I don't know Agent Keen well at all.
Maybe she is what they're saying she is.
But Harold Cooper -- you remove a man like that,
and you get me wondering.
Which is why I'm naming you
as acting director of this task force.
I need a right hand on this, one I can trust.
So you want me to investigate my partner?
You're an agent who puts a premium on doing what's right.
You want to give Keen the benefit of the doubt?
Good.
But if she is guilty, I know you'll do
what it takes to hold her accountable and make the case.
Sorry to interrupt.
Agent Keen's blood test just came in.
She tested positive for the virus
that killed Senator Hawkins.
I've been relieved of duty.
I'm not surprised.
And Connolly's minions are questioning Agent Keen.
The man has the weight of the entire D.O.J. behind him
If he wants to indict her.
There won't be an indictment.
They'll rig the evidence against her,
parade her in front of the cameras
so america can see the face of the enemy,
and then they'll put her away someplace
where she has no chance to mount a defense.
I have to go back.
You won't be allowed in the building.
We can't just leave her there.
Of course not.
We're gonna walk her right out the door.
You have someone on the inside?
Yes.
Fortunately, I also have a man at the power company.
The lines will be cut
to both the main and emergency power supplies.
Battery boot protocol will recycle within 60 seconds.
It will take another 30 seconds for the cameras to cycle.
That's 90 seconds for Agent Keen to get out.
With your guidance, Harold, that's all the time she'll need.
I'll check it out. Stay put.
You want me to guide her out in the dark?
In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
Let me guess -- Reddington's coming to break you out.
Agent Keen, I'm to escort you to lock--
Wait! Reddington sent me!
Clock is ticking! It's for you!
Take it!
Yes!
Keen, listen closely.
You have 45 seconds before the power is up.
I need you to do exactly as I say.
Team, our power supply's not responding.
Reddington.
There's a door by the south stairwell.
My emergency access is 5-tango-293.
Head to the end of the hallway and make a right,
then an immediate left.
Damn it.
From the maintenance room, there's a utility ladder
that dumps into an emergency passageway.
The stairwell opens to a service corridor
connected to the loading dock.
Go one block west. Reddington will meet you there.
Don't do this, Keen.
They won't listen to me.
We'll make them listen.
Did you get my blood test back?
Positive for the virus.
You see? They can make anything look like the truth.
And if you run, what does that look like?
If someone's setting you up,
you're giving them exactly what they want.
You can fight this,
but if you've got to do it from inside the system.
In about 20 seconds, that camera's gonna turn back on.
If you're gonna let me go, you've got to do it now,
before people see you standing here with me.
We just missed her. Got her burner.
How could I possibly be carrying the virus that killed Hawkins?
Infecting you is not something they'd leave to chance.
They want you alone, isolated.
In the last 24 hours, what was out of the ordinary?
When did you change your plans, make a diversion?
Union Station.
Coming out of the tunnel, I was chasing Karakurt.
He blindsided me.
To infect you?
We need to pull the security tapes at Union Station.
If we can find footage of Karakurt,
maybe we can prove they infected me.
He's insisting.
Yes?
Where's Liz? I can't reach her.
I can't help you with that.
I can keep her safe. I can help her disappear.
Your assistance is not necessary.
Who was that?
Tom.
Tom is calling to take you away,
start a new life with a new identity.
But if you run now, before clearing your name,
there is no place you can go where they won't find you.
Face this now, fight it,
and you'll be free to make any choice you want.
I'll meet you back here after you get the tapes.
What are you doing?
I have an appointment.
This is a war that must be fought on many fronts.
You have yours. I have mine.
Be safe.
We have three broad-spectrum frequency jammers
being off-loaded now.
You want to run them from the catwalks?
Yes, space this size --
No communications will get in or out. I'm confident of that.
I don't need to tell you there is no margin for error.
That's correct. You do not.
What's the word from Baz?
He's trying.
Trying?
Some of the targets you selected
are thousands of miles away.
They have to be secured and transported.
I was very clear -- whatever it takes,
whatever resources are required.
Of course.
We get one chance to strike first.
We will not get another.
I'm dying, Agent Keen.
Charlene told me.
She swore me to secrecy.
I let Tom Connolly take advantage of that.
He offered me hope.
But in exchange, I did things for him.
You once told me
that I was the one person you completely trusted.
I violated that trust. I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
This...thing you're going through,
ever since Charlene told me,
I've had a pit in my stomach.
I just...
I can't imagine...
Pull yourself together, Keen.
What little time I have left, I don't want to spend it
sitting in a car, blubbering with you.
Okay.
I'm with the FBI.
We're chasing down a lead on the recent OREA bombing.
We have reason to believe
the perp fled through Union Station as recently as this morning.
We're gonna need to take a look at your feeds.
You got legal paper?
Subpoena? I can't release the footage without one.
You've got to be joking.
What?
A subpoena?
We've got a terrorist out there
who just killed 14 CIA agents.
He murdered a sitting U.S. senator.
And you want to talk about paperwork?
Salestrom.
This is Simpson. I want to give you a heads-up.
You're gonna have somebody from the bureau stopping by.
They need to have a look at surveillance.
I have someone right now.
They need to move quickly.
Give her whatever she needs.
I appreciate the help.
Of course.
The drives are uploaded to archive after midnight.
Anything from earlier today
is gonna have to be accessed from here.
Good luck.
Andropov.
Authorities have released this photo of the suspect,
FBI agent Elizabeth Keen.
Sources are confirming she is also wanted
in connection with the truck bombing
at the CIA's OREA facility.
It was Andropov.
The virologist? He infected you?
He was there.
We have to find Andropov and get him to talk.
I can't. I just got a call from our lawyer.
Charlene's been taken in for questioning.
Questioning for what?
Tom Connolly. He got her to --
She leaked a classified document to the press.
But what it means is I can't.
You're gonna have to find Andropov on your own.
Anton Velov?
Agent Keen, FBI.
We spoke briefly on the phone a few days ago.
Keen.
You were looking for information about Katarina Rostova.
Is that why you're here?
Not entirely, no.
Good.
Because if you were, you have wasted your time.
As I told you, I never knew Katarina.
I need you to tell me where I can find Leo Andropov.
How should I know where he is?
You were a C.I.
for one of the OREA agents that died in the bombing.
You recorded a conversation for him
that took place here in this restaurant,
and we know Andropov was a part of that conversation.
So I'm gonna ask you again, where can I find him?
There is a safe house in Ivy City.
A safe house. An address?
L Street, across from Olive's Diner.
Now, if there's nothing else...
That's not what you told me on the phone.
You said you could help me with Katarina Rostova.
I don't know anything.
I told you how to find Andropov.
And now I want you to tell me about her.
I can't say.
First, you don't know. Now you can't say.
Which is it?
You got to him.
I retained his services.
In exchange for his silence about my mother.
Harold told me the man who infected you
was the virologist Andropov.
You got me out of the Post Office.
You gave me a chance to prove my innocence.
I know you think you care about me.
But every time you do something
that makes me think you really do,
you do something else that reminds me
that you simply aren't capable of it.
I'm a sin eater.
I absorb the misdeeds of others,
darkening my soul to keep theirs pure.
That is what I'm capable of.
What sin of mine could you possibly have absorbed?
Andropov -- do you have a lead?
I do, and I'll handle it on my own,
because that's what I'm capable of.
Liz, I've been looking everywhere for you.
I have a lead, something that could clear all of this up,
but I need your help.
I went to your motel. There were cops everywhere.
It's on the TV, news reports.
There is no clearing it up, all right?
There is only leaving it behind.
I can't.
If I run now, then I'll be looking over my shoulder
for the rest of my life.
That's Reddington talking.
Yes, it is. And he's right.
I can't leave now.
Then I can't stay.
This lead I have -- Leo Andropov --
Never heard of him.
He created the virus that killed Hawkins. He infected me.
If we can find him, then maybe I can prove I was set up.
But I don't think I can do it on my own.
I've got an address.
He's on the street!
It's me. I've been made.
I'm on my way to the extraction point.
Turn! Up there on the right!
Yeah, I see him.
You're losing him!
Are you honestly telling me how to drive right now?
Yes! I'm not the one who hit a deer on the turnpike.
That was not deer blood on the windshield.
Just don't lose him.
He turned down the alley. Circle back.
Where the hell have you been?
We have to go now!
What are you doing?!
No!
That's everything!
No!
Oh, God!
Stay with me! Come on!
My mother -- he's the only one who knew about her.
Liz -- Liz, he's gone.
Hello, Mr. Hastings.
I'm here on behalf of Raymond Reddington.
Mr. Chin, Raymond Reddington sends his regards.
Last target secured, sir.
Traveling to location.
What?
What?
Today. In the alley.
What about the alley?
It's the weirdest thing.
In that moment with the bullets flying and the glass...
one thing kept running through my head.
"The boat, the boat.
Why didn't you just get on his boat?"
Tell me what to do.
You're still bleeding.
I'm fine.
Tom, I said I was fine.
I know you did.
That hurt?
What is it?
What's wrong?
I don't want to regret anything.
What could you possibly regret?
Not saying yes.
Yes to what?
You.
Take me with you.
Don't say that.
I'm here. All we have to do is go.
Liz, if you go away with me,
you'll never get answers.
You'll never find out who you really are.
I don't need to know who I am to know what I want.
What do you want, Liz?
You.
At this hour,
police continue their search for FBI agent Elizabeth Keen,
who authorities have named a person of interest
in the death of Senator Clifford Hawkins.
You have a gun or are you just happy to see me?
The flash drive that we found in Andropov's safe house --
It's full of records, including documents about Cooper.
Cooper.
Yeah.
His medical records, test results,
medications, the -- the senator,
the bombing.
Liz, slow down.
Cooper's doctor works for the Cabal.
I'll be back.
No, you won't.
I got to...
Tom...
Go.
Agent Cooper.
Agent Cooper, it's Keen. I need to see you.
It's about your doctor.
The dye we inserted highlighted --
Who do you work for? Get out! - Harold, I'm in the middle of a --
Harold -- - I know about Andropov.
That the drugs you gave me came from him.
There never was a clinical trial, was there?
No, no.
It was all a lie.
Please, please, please!
Please, they -- they threatened my family.
You family? And what about my family?
You made me believe I was getting cured!
No, no, no.
I made you believe you were sick.
Say that again?
You're not sick.
The test results,
the brain scans -- I saw the tumor.
No, you saw a tumor, but it wasn't yours.
The MRIs, the CAT scans, the blood tests --
it was all fake!
You're lying to me.
No, no, no! I'm not! I'm not!
But I felt sick. I needed a cane.
Y-yes. And -- and then you didn't.
It was the medicine.
Andropov -- he --
he designed it so that you'd manifest
the symptoms of a glioblastoma.
Then he altered your dosage
to make you think the trial was working.
I don't know why he did it, but he did.
You have to believe me.
There's nothing wrong with you.
My name is Raymond Reddington.
The United States government has placed me
at top the country's list of most-wanted fugitives
for a colorful and not uninteresting assortment of crimes,
most of which I have committed.
That's who I am.
You, in turn, are by my estimation
11 of the finest investigative journalists in the world.
I'm here to tell you a story.
I'm sure you recognize many of the faces behind me.
They are among the most powerful men and women on the planet.
They are also part of a global conspiracy,
a shadow organization that spans across every continent
and has for the last three decades,
consisting of leaders in world government
and the private sector.
Some call this group "The Cabal."
The world you live in
is the world they want you to think you live in.
They start wars, create chaos.
And when it suits them, they resolve it.
Cabal members will move more money in the next quarter
than the World Bank will in the next year.
Their alliance effects sea change
in every aspect of human life --
the value and distribution of commodities,
money, weapons, water, fuel,
the food we eat to live,
the information we rely on to tell us who we are.
What exactly do you expect us to do with this information?
Study it, investigate it to determine the truth,
and then report it.
Let me be clear.
Investigating this group
will immediately position you as a threat.
If you do what I'm asking, you'll be putting your lives
and the lives of those you love at grave risk.
In the end, "The truth will out."
Not all of us will live to see that day,
but the truth will out.
Tom, we need to talk.
I don't think we have anything to say to each other.
I spoke with Dr. Levin.
He recorded your conversations.
You got a lot of chutzpah coming here.
Oh, he's got much more than that.
I have my health.
What a miracle -- cancer free.
But then, you know that, don't you, Tom?
How quickly fortunes can turn.
I wouldn't call your security.
Not until you've heard what we have to say.
We have the tapes -- recordings that prove
you blackmailed Dr. Levin into falsifying my medical records.
So here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna make this go away, all of it.
You're gonna exonerate me by prosecuting Karakurt,
the real killer of those 14 agents and Senator Hawkins.
You're going to agree not to press charges against Charlene.
You're going to reinstate Agent Cooper,
and you're going to convey to the director
that he is not to touch Raymond Reddington.
Why would I agree to any of that?
Because if you refuse, we'll take the evidence to the bureau.
I own the bureau.
Then we'll go to a federal judge.
Good luck.
A river of influence runs deep,
or have you forgotten how easily we made Judge Denner
suppress first-degree murder charges against you, Agent Keen.
Look around. Why do you think I'm here?
There's a banquet tonight, Fraternal Order of Police.
I'm the keynote speaker.
Four hours from now, I'm going to be on that stage,
announcing that my office has secured an indictment
against the members of a rogue task force.
This task force was authorized by the FBI and the D.O.J.
By my predecessor at the D.O.J.
You're going to prison, Agent Keen.
Donald Ressler-- his little oxy addiction
will get him drummed out of the bureau.
Samar Navabi will be extradited to Iran,
where she will stand trial for
the murder of one of their top nuclear scientists.
Charlene, Harold, even Agent Mojtabai.
We have a little something in mind for all of you,
including treason charges and the death penalty for Reddington.
So are we finished here?
Because I think it's cocktail hour.
What are you gonna do, Agent Keen-- arrest me?
Keen, put it down.
I am nothing. I am a cog in a very large wheel.
Shoot me, and somebody at least as powerful
will take my place.
You just won't know who.
Agent Keen, you do this,
you become everything they say you are.
I can't let him.
Elizabeth, listen to me.
That conversation we had in my hospital room,
the good person I told you I didn't want to lose...
the agent you were before all of this--
You do this, and she's gone.
Keen...
run.
Excuse me.
Ressler?
Where the hell are you?
Listen to me.
Harold cooper-- he had nothing to do with this.
You need to turn yourself in.
Did you hear me? He's innocent.
You are a wanted fugitive.
You murdered the Attorney General of the United States.
You have to come in.
I can't.
Damn it, Liz, wake up.
You keep running, you will be hunted down.
I know.
By me.
Don't make me do this.
Please, Liz, tell me where you are.
Tell me, and I can get--
Lizzy.
I need your help.
Where are you?
I killed Tom Connolly.
I know. Where are you?
I'm on... 7th and L, Northeast.
I'm gonna call you back in two minutes with an address.
I need you to get there. I'm gonna get you out.
It's me. I need to travel.
I remember.
I remember everything.
Remember what?
The night of the fire.
I know what happened,
and I understand why you didn't want me to find out.
When I pulled the trigger...
when I shot Connolly, I...
It came back to me.
It was like I was there.
I could hear them arguing.
He was hurting her.
And I know why my father died that night.
Masha?
I shot him.
That's why you blocked my memory --
not to protect yourself.
To protect me.
Yeah.
