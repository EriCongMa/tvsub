so how does this game work ?
i just throw out like a real ball ?
yep . just nice and easy , right over the plate .
all right .
you suck , wolowitz !
what &apos;s that about ?
i &apos;m heckling you .
it &apos;s a beloved part of baseball .
he &apos;s right .
and given that you &apos;re probably still waiting
to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade ,
i &apos;m sure you do suck .
hi . what &apos;s going on ?
baseball .
okay , this is not what i meant when i said go outside and play .
he &apos;s practicing .
for what ?
the angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch ,
主场位于加州橘郡的安那罕 也是迪士尼乐园所在地
so guess who they called ?
what , you ? really ? !
well , a lot of people who weren &apos;t available , but then me !
that &apos;s so cool ! congratulations .
i guess that makes you the athlete of the group .
well , not just him !
may i remind you that you &apos;re talking to the
seeker , beater , chaser and water boy
of the third place griffith park quidditch team .
i know .
watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick
between his legs isn &apos;t something you forget .
c &apos;mon now , throw one .
all right , here we go .
you look like a jackass !
cut it out ! you &apos;re hurting my feelings !
now you know why we &apos;re not outside .
did you enjoy my lecture ?
no , and neither did our waiter .
well , if you &apos;re going to serve cornish game hen ,
you should either be familiar with the history of cornwall
or be prepared to learn it .
it &apos;s hard to argue with that .
and i know
because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill
desperately try and fail .
hey , how was dinner ?
good , i had cornish game hen .
oh , that poor waiter .
sheldon , how about tomorrow night we see a movie ?
you guys are going out two nights in a row ?
i missed a number of date nights while i was on my train trip ,
and i &apos;m contractually obligated to make them up
under the terms of the relationship agreement .
that &apos;s so hot .
it &apos;s better than hot , it &apos;s binding .
if you &apos;re free tomorrow night ,
i &apos;d love to have you join us on a double date .
you are aware that a double date doesn &apos;t count as two dates .
well , then come or don &apos;t . i don &apos;t care .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re sore .
hey , even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game .
but they throw an actual ball .
you were throwing air at a tv .
for your information ,
i also gave leonard one hell of a high five .
i &apos;m kind of surprised you agreed to do this
in front of a stadium full of people .
they &apos;re doing space day and nasa asked me .
i felt like i couldn &apos;t say no .
okay .
well , if you want , i could help you practice .
i played a lot of softball growing up .
thank you , that would be great .
great . and while we &apos;re at it ,
maybe we could butch up your run
for when you head out to the mound .
what &apos;s wrong with the way i run ?
oh , just kidding .
nothing .
sheldon , i &apos;m surprised you &apos;d choose to go to a pub .
at our committee meeting ,
amy made a motion for a picnic in a park ,
but i tacked so many amendments on that thing
it sank like a lead balloon .
i then suggested a pub .
yeah , which i was initially skeptical of
until i saw online that they serve yorkshire pudding .
you don &apos;t even like yorkshire pudding .
no , it &apos;s yucky ,
but informing people about the history of yorkshire
is yummy , yum @-@ yum .
after a lively debate ,
that proposal passed by a two @-@ zero margin .
nice to see a busy couple
keep the spark of bureaucracy alive .
ignore them , amy . they &apos;re just jealous
because they &apos;ll never have a relationship as good as ours .
isn &apos;t this when he says &quot; bazooka &quot; or something ?
i wasn &apos;t making a joke ,
i was merely stating fact .
amy and i have a superior relationship to yours .
you don &apos;t honestly think that , do you ?
y ... leonard ,
i assumed you knew .
the ranking of relationships in our circle
by quality is : me and amy ,
howard and bernadette , raj and his girlfriend ,
penny and chardonnay , penny and you .
there isn &apos;t any ranking .
and if there were , we wouldn &apos;t be at the bottom of it .
yeah , and actually , i drink sauvignon blanc .
that &apos;s the part you have a problem with ?
relax .
there they go , fighting again .
you &apos;d never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc .
so you never played baseball as a kid ,
not even little league ?
well , i was going to , but the day of tryouts
i found my dad &apos;s playboy collection .
threw my arm out .
all right , the pitcher &apos;s mound in major league baseball
is 60 feet , six inches away from home plate .
great . you take this
and say when to stop .
how much further ?
keep going .
how about now ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
are you saying &quot; stop &quot;
and we &apos;re just too far away to hear you ?
okay , stop .
are you kidding me ? !
that &apos;s 60 feet .
there &apos;s no way this is 60 feet .
i &apos;m looking at it .
you realize this isn &apos;t one of those times
i want you to exaggerate how long something is .
okay , i got to ... i @-@ i just ...
i got to ask :
what makes you think that your relationship
is so wonderful and ours isn &apos;t ?
for starters ,
we enjoy spending time together .
so do we .
and i &apos;ve seen you guys ignore each other for hours
doing totally different things .
it &apos;s called parallel play .
相互之间没有互动和交流
yeah , toddlers do that .
not as well as we do .
you believe this guy ? he has to be the best at everything .
so what ? why do you even care ?
oh , listen to them .
not even married and the honeymoon &apos;s over .
whatever . you can &apos;t even go on a date
without checking your relationship agreement .
if you &apos;ve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract ,
i &apos;d like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies
that entered a &quot; relationship agreement &quot;
called the u.s. constitution .
and it may not be cool to say so ,
but i think that love affair is still pretty hot today .
it &apos;s a good thing i &apos;m not wearing flag underwear right now ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s about to be a fire .
okay , it &apos;s not that hard .
you just look to where you want to throw it ,
step towards where you want to throw ,
and throw it .
that &apos;s your help ?
that &apos;s like saying , &quot; here &apos;s how you fly a plane :
get in the airplane ,
know where you want to go and fly it . &quot;
just throw the ball . let &apos;s see what we &apos;re working with .
come on howard , fire it in .
throw the damn ball !
so when do you guys plan on getting married ?
uh , we &apos;re not sure . but i want to wait long enough
to prove to my mother i &apos;m not pregnant .
may i have one of your fries ?
of course .
can i have a bite of your burger ?
absolutely not .
some perfect couple .
he won &apos;t even share his food with her .
it has avocado on it .
she &apos;s allergic to avocado .
are you so jealous of our relationship
you want amy to die ?
i &apos;m not jealous .
i just think it &apos;s silly for you to compare relationships
like they &apos;re something that can be quantified .
everything is quantifiable .
that french fry ? a seven .
spider @-@ man ? a nine .
the number nine-- oddly , only a four .
how ridiculous is he ?
a hundred .
sheldon , you &apos;re just assigning random numbers
to things based on your opinion .
no , i &apos;m not .
french fries have three variables--
crispiness , saltiness and shape .
which is why a curly fry only gets a two .
if i wanted curls for dinner , i &apos;d order a clown wig .
well , a relationship is more complicated than a french fry .
not according to the work of berscheid , snyder and omoto .
oh , what did those rascals do now ?
they developed the relationship closeness inventory ,
which predicts the stability of a couple based on behavior .
yeah , not to be confused
with the french fry goodness inventory .
that &apos;s pure cooper .
so , this is accurate ?
it &apos;s been around for 25 years ,
and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers .
well , kind of takes the romance out of relationships .
kind of ? it does it perfectly .
sheldon and i got an eight @-@ point @-@ two out of ten .
fine . we &apos;ll take it right now .
no , don &apos;t .
what ?
just don &apos;t take it .
why not ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s stupid . who cares what number it is ?
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
i said i don &apos;t want you to .
i &apos;m getting another drink .
sorry .
i &apos;m gonna let you count this as two dates .
they &apos;re a lot of work .
think he &apos;s getting any better ?
yup .
that was a close one !
okay !
is it too late for him to cancel ?
i think so .
heads up ! watch out !
are you mad at me ?
no , stop being stupid .
um ... whew ?
is this about the test , or is this about us ?
look , i don &apos;t need a score on a test
to make me worry about something i &apos;m already worried about .
what are you worried about ?
that we &apos;re engaged and have nothing in common ,
and it scares me .
yeah , that scares me , too .
it does ?
sometimes .
well , that &apos;s not good !
you being blindly infatuated with me was the rock
we were building this relationship on !
okay , well , this might make you feel better .
uh , we &apos;re both scared that our marriage will be a disaster ,
and so , that &apos;s something that we have in common .
also , we both think i &apos;m not funny .
huh ? see , you &apos;re not laughing .
hey , froot loops , what &apos;s up ?
hey , mike .
listen , nasa asked me to
throw out the first pitch at an angels game .
you got any advice ?
yeah . don &apos;t do it .
what else you up to ?
why shouldn &apos;t i do it ?
there &apos;s no upside .
if you do well , no one cares .
and if you screw up ,
you &apos;re an idiot on youtube forever .
but it &apos;s for a good cause .
what about all the kids that &apos;ll be there ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m telling you .
kids are the worst .
my own daughter tweeted i have a giant nose .
well , maybe i &apos;ll do a good job .
i don &apos;t know .
in space , you couldn &apos;t even toss me a pen ,
and that was in zero gravity .
okay , thanks for the pep talk .
anytime , froot loops .
give your wife a hug for me .
she &apos;s so much cuter than you ,
i don &apos;t know how you ever got her .
he &apos;s so nice .
hey , sorry about that .
no , we &apos;re sorry .
we never should have been comparing relationships in the first place .
why ? we won .
you know , i say , next , we take on koothrappali and his dog .
really give ourselves a challenge .
i just want to say one more thing about this .
just because penny and i are very different people
does not mean that we &apos;re a bad couple .
the answer is one simple test away .
you know , it &apos;s like when i thought
there was a possum in my closet .
did i sit around wondering ?
no , i sent leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag .
i killed his chewbacca slippers .
let &apos;s just take the test .
no , no , no , i don &apos;t want to .
oh , well , &apos; cause you know we &apos;re gonna do bad .
because it doesn &apos;t matter .
i don &apos;t care if we &apos;re a ten or a two .
or a one . a one is possible .
marriage is scary .
you &apos;re scared , i &apos;m scared .
but it doesn &apos;t make me not want to do it .
it @-@ it just ...
makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you .
leonard ...
it would make me so happy if you said things like that .
we got an eight @-@ point @-@ two .
trust me , you &apos;re happy .
i love how they put a waterfall at center field .
it really ties the whole stadium together .
look at you , talking sports .
this is fun , huh ?
we get to see our friend throw out the first pitch ,
have a hot dog , watch the game .
nobody said anything about watching the game .
sheldon , what did you expect ?
i expected to see howard throw the baseball ,
finish my hot dog ,
and hightail it across the street to disneyland
just in time for mickey &apos;s soundsational parade .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
if we stay , i &apos;ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead .
who &apos;s the bobblehead of ?
does it matter ?
no , as long as it bobbles .
howie , i am so proud of you .
thanks . i &apos;m proud of me , too .
you ready ?
let &apos;s do it .
all right .
wish me luck .
go get &apos; em .
ladies and gentlemen ,
in honor of space day at angel stadium ,
the first pitch will be thrown out
by nasa astronaut howard wolowitz .
thank you .
thank you .
can he really throw a ball ?
on our quidditch team , he ...
yeah , that &apos;s a &quot; no . &quot;
i have a message for the young people here today .
when i was asked to throw the first pitch ,
a little voice in my head said i couldn &apos;t do it .
so , i practiced and practiced ,
and you know what ?
that little voice ...
... was right , but ...
... then i remembered that i &apos;m not an athlete .
i &apos;m a scientist .
so , today &apos;s first pitch
will be delivered to home plate by science .
ladies and gentlemen ,
boys and girls , i present to you
a working prototype of the mars rover !
and here &apos;s the wind @-@ up ...
and the pitch !
why is it going so slow ? !
&apos;cause i &apos;m an idiot who didn &apos;t think this through !
okay , new plan .
we go to disneyland ,
play hide and seek on tom sawyer &apos;s island ,
and then come back and see the end of the pitch .
okay , while we &apos;re waiting for the ball to arrive ,
here &apos;s some fun facts about mars .
you suck , wolowitz !
he makes a valid point !
okay , booing isn &apos;t gonna make it go any faster !
