we have church the next morning , starts at 11 : 00 .
oh , we &apos;re going to the game night .
moving church to monday afternoon .
well , if you change your mind , please let us know .
we could become &quot; couples friends . &quot;
now , let me try some of ned flanders &apos; no alarm chili .
you &apos;ll only taste the spoon .
brilliant .
why don &apos;t we have any couples friends ?
because ... couples friends are a myth ,
started by restaurants with tables for four .
i want friends !
any friends .
okay , sweetie .
i &apos;ll call the van houtens .
not the van houtens .
but ...
they &apos;re always bragging about their trip to rome .
it was 12 years ago , and it was a layover .
i want new friends .
can i make an observation ?
i &apos;m okay with no friends .
it &apos;s easier to focus ,
and it &apos;ll give me great material for whatever art form i choose .
right now , i &apos;m thinking long novella .
good night .
okay with no friends ?
that &apos;s the saddest thing i can imagine
my daughter saying to me .
i can think of worse .
the saddest thing would be
if you were driving and texting lisa
and you hit her .
and the last thing she texted before she died was ,
&quot; i got your message . &quot;
good night .
well , they all make good points .
and now , the moment of truth
on topiary wars .
this taj mahal should be floated down the ganges .
i &apos;m sorry , cathy .
turn in your shears and ladders .
come and get &apos; em !
oh ! thank you .
why was that on the military history channel ?
we &apos;re going to that game party ,
and we &apos;re going to be charming and witty .
you &apos;re not going to eat too much ,
and we &apos;re not going to stay too late .
you will not sing unless there &apos;s a sing @-@ along ,
and never take the tray out of the caterer &apos;s hand .
don &apos;t be too loud , and don &apos;t be too quiet .
when you &apos;re too quiet , you get that psycho look .
and stay in the living room .
don &apos;t go to their kids &apos; room and watch a basketball game .
can i check out what toys they have ?
no .
dinner party at the neighbors &apos; .
at least i can drink .
one drink .
wha ... ? ! walking distance , marge !
i &apos;ve been looking forward to this all week .
don &apos;t show your wife this app !
powering down !
you were charming enough to win me ,
and that day you didn &apos;t have a drink in you .
marge ! homer !
homer .
you know , i have more cheeks .
i &apos;d like you to meet my wife wallis .
how ya doin &apos; ?
wallis has unearthed the most delightful entertainment
to thrill us for hours on end .
it &apos;s a murder mystery , and we &apos;re all suspects .
great ! i &apos;ve always wanted to try and solve a crime .
please , everyone , read your bio .
i am a humble farmer from yorkshire .
humble i can be !
that &apos;s the spirit !
wallis and i have found this game to provide
a full evening of divertissement ,
building in suspense to a masterful climax .
we &apos;ve rented costumes
you &apos;ll find accurate to period and conducive to character .
we will serve food and wine
appropriate to period and palette .
we &apos;ve programmed music to cover every dramatic event .
hired a foley artist .
i believe the mare has a slight limp .
yes . yes !
so , for the next three hours ,
i welcome you to the moors of ...
question .
uh , it says here
the murderer is admiral wainsworth .
who &apos;s that ?
you &apos;ve ... you @-@ you &apos;ve given away the game !
well , you know ...
why you ... !
thank you so much !
now wallis will once again withdraw into melancholia !
birth , school , work , death .
worth , drool , shirk , breath .
mirth , cruel , quirk , meth .
just so you know , homer , you were going to be
a dashing russian count with multiple lovers !
well , as we say in russia ,
&quot; good @-@ bye in russian ! &quot;
dasvidaniya !
uh , nice night for a walk .
i &apos;d like to be alone for a while .
you want to be more alone ?
yes .
more ?
what the ... ? ! d &apos;oh !
that &apos;s good .
okay , i slept on the couch
and i flipped the sweaty cushions over .
what else can i do ?
it &apos;s okay .
i mean , those people didn &apos;t even want us at that party in the first place .
i think it &apos;s time we learn to live with being ostracized .
don &apos;t you dare say &quot; ostrich eyes &quot; !
because ... uh ...
oh ! oh , okay , okay !
what should we do ?
nothing . i give up .
no more dinner parties .
our whole social life will be us watching tv
and you going to moe &apos;s .
i see .
well , if that &apos;s how you think it has to be .
yes , for us .
but not for lisa .
never for lisa .
we &apos;re going to help her make friends .
it might be easier with maggie .
she &apos;s always getting letters from the day care center .
those are past @-@ due bills .
they &apos;ll get their blood money .
and lisa will get a friend .
after this , we &apos;ll do makeovers .
so where are all the friends ?
i don &apos;t know .
i invited everyone that lisa &apos;s ever met .
who are you ?
gus huebner .
i was on lisa &apos;s coed soccer team two years ago .
well , lisa &apos;s gonna be here in five minutes ,
and the only kid who showed up is gus freakin &apos; huebner .
watch your mouth .
oh , no , you &apos;re right , homer . abort !
abort !
oh , no .
i was the only chump who showed up at this train wreck .
well , i &apos;m not leaving till i get a party .
fine , fine . homer , give him a party .
gus huebner ?
is that you ?
i wish .
that kid can play youth soccer .
are you guys okay ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , sure . i &apos;m fine .
yeah . that &apos;s ... nothing &apos;s going on .
right , right . nothing .
what &apos;s for dinner ?
pizza .
lots of pizza .
so , as her teacher , i was wondering if you could tell me
why lisa has such trouble making friends .
marge , this is when i normally eat lunch .
so i &apos;ll just tell you lisa is ... unique .
and we &apos;re done .
all right . for some reason ,
square dancing is a part of the gym curriculum .
now , i &apos;m gonna open the divider to the girls &apos; gym ,
and if you don &apos;t find a dance partner within ten seconds ,
there is something very wrong with you !
that &apos;s tough luck , lisa .
looks like you &apos;re dancing with groundskeeper willie .
careful of your toes .
i got me cleats on !
i &apos;ll dance with lisa .
tumi ? but you &apos;re from the other second grade .
we only come together for tornado drills .
god , i hate square dancing .
it ain &apos;t gym class if a fat kid &apos;s not crying .
let &apos;s do this thing .
swing your partner , swing her hard
do @-@ si @-@ do while i bombard
do @-@ si @-@ do while i bombard
oh , thank god , the clock says three
&apos;cause i have to take a pee
finally .
that was fun .
yes , it kinda was !
but i won &apos;t push it , i promise . see ya .
oh , wait , wait , wait .
i was going to all sales vinyl after school .
the vintage record store ?
yeah . you want to come with me ?
at the risk of sounding like a broken record ,
yes , yes , yes !
they will fit . they will fit .
yes !
nobody likes jazz that much .
even the guy playing it had to take drugs .
it &apos;s so much fun
to finally have a friend who likes the npr show
wait wait ... don &apos;t tell me ! as much as i do .
so , carl kasell , how did the house minority whip
do on our news quiz ?
well , peter , he got two out of three right ,
so he wins me recording his outgoing message .
oh , that &apos;s okay . really . no , no , no . please don &apos;t .
it &apos;s not optional .
see , marge ?
problems will work themselves out
if you just leave them alone .
want some more smoothie ?
as long as you load up on the kale and chia .
oh , no one likes veggie smoothies that much .
or at all . hmm .
something &apos;s fishy about that girl ,
and i &apos;m gonna follow her till i find out what .
and i &apos;m gonna help you .
i think i &apos;ll need you back at headquarters manning the phones .
great . what do i say ?
just let &apos; em ring .
got it !
* they smile in your face *
* all the time they want to take your place *
* the backstabbers *
* backstabbers *
* they smile in your face *
* all the time they want to take your place *

* the backstabbers *
* all you fellas who have someone *
* and you really care *

* low @-@ down , dirty *
what do you want ?
i &apos;ve got two things for you .
this envelope will change your life
for the low , low price of five dollars ,
and i &apos;ll throw in a piece of great advice .
tempted ?
what &apos;s the advice ?
don &apos;t open the envelope .
oh , god , i &apos;m gonna be sick .
mom paid her to be my friend ?
that &apos;s mine .
it &apos;s for my library card .
you don &apos;t want to be here .
neither do you !
mom , how could you pay someone to be my friend ?
answer me !
oh , i wouldn &apos;t say i paid someone to be your friend .
i just gave her money for records and ice cream .
you gave away ice cream ? !
i would &apos;ve found a friend eventually .
you couldn &apos;t wait a damn decade until i got into college ?
oh , lisa . lisa , wait !
oh , god , oh , god .
i &apos;m the smart parent .
i &apos;m sorry she rejected your &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; cake ,
but , in a way , i &apos;m not .
i guess what i &apos;m trying to say is i like cake .
marge , don &apos;t feel bad .
you did what any parent would do .
no , i think i went too far .
let me tell you a little story
about a chubby unpopular boy named homer .
is that the boy you named me after ?
it is you , you idiot !
whoa . little homer had
a devil of a time making friends .
no one wanted to come visit him .
so i decided to take matters into my own hands .
i paid a couple of boys ,
lenny and carl , to make my homer feel loved .
a relationship i continued to this day .
you pay lenny and carl to be my friends ? !
yes , but barney &apos;s yours for nothing .
well , that makes me feel better .
lisa &apos;s door is unlocked !
dad , is that story really true ?
i wouldn &apos;t pay ten cents to a lion
to stop him from eating you !
lisa , just say something to me .
i &apos;m gonna tell every psychiatrist
i ever go to what you did .
a mother &apos;s greatest fear .
wow , i made mom cry .
what unimaginable power .
i can use this to get anything i want .
but right now , all i want
is for mom to stop crying .
mom , stop ! stop !
stop . i &apos;m sorry .
please stop !
you &apos;re not mad anymore ?
i &apos;m fine . fine .
it &apos;s funny , but ...
hurting your feelings made me feel better .
mm , try to forget that .
but when i grow up , i &apos;ll find other weird kids ,
and we will have the most intense relationships ever .
and i &apos;ll always love you .
happy mother &apos;s day .
mother &apos;s day ? !
mother &apos;s day ? ! crap !
okay , initially i was just gonna be your friend
till i could afford a nice belt .
but i like you , lisa ,
and i want to keep being friends with you .
great . but from now on ,
we have to be totally honest with each other .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
i &apos;m not really a vegetarian .
have you ever tried horse meat ?
they eat it raw in japan , and ...
