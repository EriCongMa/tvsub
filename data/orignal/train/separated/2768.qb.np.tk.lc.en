i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d actually say that .
i &apos;d much rather be mr. peanut than mr. salty .
no way . mr. salty is a sailor .
he &apos;s gotta be the toughest snack there is .
i don &apos;t know . you don &apos;t wanna mess with cornnuts .
they &apos;re crazy .
oh , my god . you gotta come see this .
there &apos;s some creep out there with a telescope .
i can &apos;t believe it . he &apos;s looking right at us .
oh , that is so sick .
i feel violated .
and not in a good way .
how can people do that ?
you guys , look . ugly naked guy got gravity boots .
the one with the evil orthodontist
years from now , school children will study it ...
... as one of the greatest first dates ever .
yeah .
i &apos;ll say , yeah .
it was unbelievable .
we could be ourselves . we didn &apos;t have to play games .
have you called her ?
she &apos;d know i like her . that &apos;s crazy .
guys . it &apos;s gross .
it &apos;s the next day . how needy do i wanna seem ?
i &apos;m right . right ?
yeah , let her dangle .
i can &apos;t believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people .
come on . just do it .
call her . stop being so testosterone @-@ y .
which , by the way , is the real san francisco treat .
her machine .
answering machine ?
no , interestingly , her leaf blower picked up .
so , why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
no . last time i left a spontaneous message ...
... i ended up using the phrase , &quot; yes , indeed @-@ io . &quot;
look , it &apos;s rachel and barry . don &apos;t everybody look .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re just talking .
does he look upset ?
does he look like he was told to shove anything ?
no . actually , he &apos;s smiling .
oh , my god . don &apos;t do that .
what ? what ? what ?
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon .
and basically , that &apos;s how a bill becomes a law .
see ? hey , rach .
how &apos;d it go ?
you know , it was actually really great .
lunch at the russian tea room .
i had that chicken , where you poke it and butter squirts out .
not a good day for birds .
then we went to bendel &apos;s .
and i told him not to , but he got me a bottle of chanel .
that &apos;s nice . now was that before or after you told him ...
... to stop calling , stop sending flowers and to leave you alone ?
right . well , we never actually got to that .
it was just so nice to see him again .
it was comfortable and it was familiar .
it was just nice .
that &apos;s nice twice .
isn &apos;t this the same barry who you left at the altar ?
where have you been ?
it was different with him today .
he wasn &apos;t , like , orthodontist guy .
i mean , we had fun . is there anything wrong with that ?
yes
why ?
i have my reasons .
he &apos;s engaged to another woman ...
... who happens to be your ex @-@ best friend ?
all right . i know it &apos;s stupid .
i &apos;ll see him this afternoon and put an end to it .
i &apos;m not crazy , right ? i mean , it was never like that .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
it was so nice having this little sink here .
then with authority , hang up .
will you just leave her the message ?
okay . all right , fine .
&quot; oh , danielle , i wasn &apos;t expecting the machine .
give me a call when you get a chance .
bye @-@ bye .
oh , god .
that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been working on for two hours ?
hey , i &apos;ve been honing .
what was with the dishes ?
she might think i &apos;m in a restaurant .
i might have a life . like i haven &apos;t been sitting here ...
... honing for the last two hours ?
the telescope guy &apos;s doing it again .
oh , my god .
go away . stop looking in here .
great . now he &apos;s waving back .
we gotta do something .
i caught him looking into our place . i feel like i can &apos;t do stuff .
what kind of stuff ?
will you grow up ? i &apos;m not talking about sexy stuff ...
... but , like , when i &apos;m cooking naked .
you cook naked ?
yeah , toast , oatmeal . nothing that spatters .
what are you looking at me for ? i didn &apos;t know that .
what &apos;s the matter ?
i just oh , barry , this was not good .
no , it was . it was very , very good .
what about mindy ?
way better than mindy .
i mean , what about you and mindy ?
if you want , i &apos;ll break it off with her .
no , don &apos;t do that . not for me .
dr. farber , bobby rush is here for his adjustment .
thanks , bernice .

no , we can go to aruba .
when i went there on what would &apos;ve been our honeymoon ...
... it was really nice . you would &apos;ve liked it .
i had a bra .
hey , dr. farber .
all right , miss greene , everything looks fine .
we &apos;re starting to see some real progress .

i &apos;m 1.2 , i &apos;m not stupid .
can i use your phone ?
for future reference , that thing in your hand ...
... can also be used as a phone .
yes , it &apos;s working .
why isn &apos;t she calling ?
maybe she never got your message .
call her machine , and if she has a lot of beeps ...
... that means she didn &apos;t get her messages yet .
doesn &apos;t that make me seem ?
desperate ? needy ? pathetic ?
you obviously saw my personal ad .
how many beeps ?
she answered .
this is where you &apos;d use that &quot; hello &quot; word .
i won &apos;t talk to her . she got my message ...
... and is choosing not to call me . now i &apos;m needy and snubbed .
god , i miss just being needy .
so how &apos;d he take it ?
pretty well , actually .
how come you have dental floss in your hair ?
oh , do l ?
we ended up having sex in his chair .
you had sex in his chair ?
i said that a little too loudly , didn &apos;t l ?
you had what ?
sex in his chair .
what ... ? what were you thinking ?
i don &apos;t know . we still care about each other .
there &apos;s a history there . it &apos;s like you and carol .
it &apos;s nothing like me and carol .
if she said to you , &quot; ross , i want you on this couch ...
... right here , right now , &quot; what would you say ?
if it helps , i could slide over .
it &apos;s a totally different situation . it &apos;s apples and oranges .
it &apos;s orthodontists and lesbians i gotta go .

i gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by mindy .
she may not even know .
i haven &apos;t heard from her in seven months , what else is it about ?
she was my best friend .
we went to camp together , she taught me how to kiss
yeah ?
now , you know , i &apos;m , like , the other woman .
i feel so
naughty .

no .
danielle , hi .

i &apos;m gonna ask once , and i want a straight answer .
not like when i asked if those red pants made my ass look big .
i know things have been weird ...
... but you &apos;re my oldest friend , except for laurie ...
... who &apos;s bitter because she lost weight ...
... and it turns out , she doesn &apos;t have a pretty face .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna say it .
okay .
will you be my maid of honor ?
of course .
that &apos;s so great .
it is . it is . it is .
that &apos;s all you wanted to ask ?
that &apos;s all .
what ?
that &apos;s not all .
oh , sure it is .
oh , no , it isn &apos;t .
i think barry &apos;s seeing someone in the city .
what would make you think that ?
since the engagement , he &apos;s acted weird .
and then last night , he came home smelling like chanel .
really ?
if it &apos;ll make you feel any better ...
... when barry and i got engaged , he was weird too .
oh , god . that &apos;s what i was afraid of .
what &apos;s what you were afraid of ?
when barry was engaged to you , he and l ...
... kind of had a little thing on the side .
what ?
i know , i know .
when he proposed , people said , &quot; he &apos;ll do to you what he did to rachel . &quot;
and now i feel so stupid .
you are so stupid .
we are both so stupid .
