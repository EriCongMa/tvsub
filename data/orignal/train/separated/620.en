第五季 第七集
In a land of myth and a time of magic,
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man.
His name... Merlin.
Well, this is nice, isn't it?
Just the two of us.
Well, three of us.
Merlin? Merlin doesn't count.
I don't count.
I'm not here, I'm not actually speaking right now.
Aren't you impressed that I remembered our anniversary?
But you didn't remember. I reminded you over a month ago.
Yes...but I remembered that it was today...
today.
Actually, I did.
Shut up, Merlin!
I did!
Arthur!
You're very fortunate, sire.
A fall like that, you could have broken your neck.
Have the men who attacked us been questioned?
I'm sorry, sire, their wounds were fatal.
We were unable to learn anything from them.
We know one thing -
it can't have been a coincidence they were there.
Sire.
We recovered your saddle from the forest trail.
The girth has been unpicked and re-stitched.
It was designed to break, sire.
It appears, Merlin, on this single, solitary occasion...
you may be right.
Afternoon, sir knights.
Horses shod and watered as requested.
You are Tyr Seward?
I am, Sir Gwaine.
You know I am.
Stable hand to the King?
That is my honour, yes.
Is the King not pleased with my work?
Have I done something wrong?
You are Gelda Seward, mother of Tyr Seward?
Yes?
And you live here with your son?
Is he in some kind of trouble?
He's been arrested on suspicion of treason.
No! No, that can't be, you've made a mistake!
My Tyr's as loyal to the King as you are!
Here.
The thread we found at the boy's home
matches that used to sabotage your saddle, sire.
Who put you up to this, Tyr?
No-one.
No-one's put me up to anything, sire.
Are you saying you acted alone?
You had no help, no accomplice?
I don't know anything about these things you're talking about.
I've done nothing, sire,
save look after your horse and tack like I always do.
The evidence is staring you in the face.
You can't deny it.
Sire...
I swear on my mother's life...
Just give me their name.
Why protect them?
They can't help you now. Just give me their name.
I have no name.
There's no name to give.
Then you leave me no choice.
Though it saddens me greatly to do so,
I must charge you with treason.
Is there anything further...
you'd like to say?
You're my King, sire.
I'd never do anything to hurt you. Never.
Tyr Seward,
by the power vested in me I hereby sentence you to death.
How long have you known Tyr?
He's been in my service since he was a boy.
Do you really think him capable of this treason?
What I think is irrelevant - the facts speak for themselves.
Arthur, to sentence him to death...
The law is the law, Merlin, whether I like it or not.
Why would Tyr want Arthur dead? It makes no sense.
Perhaps he harboured some grudge, some festering resentment.
What grudge could he bear?
He loved his work, he was deeply proud of it.
And Arthur respected him, I know he did.
He always treated him fairly and well.
Merlin, it's not always possible to know
what's in the mind of another man.
Maybe so, but Arthur was right about one thing.
Tyr could not have done this alone, someone else is involved.
And, unless we find out who they are,
what's to stop them from trying it again?
Arthur.
I know you were fond of Tyr, but you had no choice.
He was guilty.
Tyr Seward is a simple man.
He can't have planned this assassination himself.
Well, I know that's what you'd like to think. We all would.
But, hard as it is to accept, even a great and honourable King
has enemies within his walls.
Very often the last person you would suspect.
Tyr is just such a person.
No, you're right.
I suppose experience should have taught me that by now.
The important thing is he didn't succeed.
I've already lost my brother, I couldn't bear to lose you, too.
I'm here, Guinevere.
I always will be.
I'll never leave you, I promise you that.
Thought you might like some food.
Cooking's not Gaius's strong point, as you know.
Well, least it's not the turnip stew!
Thank you, Merlin.
I'd like to help you, Tyr, if I can.
You heard the King.
No-one can help me now.
I know you, Tyr.
Whatever you did, I don't believe you meant any harm.
I didn't do anything. On my honour, I didn't.
But something happened, didn't it?
No...
Tyr, please.
I know you're not to blame, just tell me what happened.
No! They'll...
Who?
This was a few days back.
One of the horses came down with colic
so I had to sleep in the stable to watch over him...
Go on, it's all right.
That night, I was woke up by a sound.
There was someone there, going over the King's saddle.
I knew it wasn't right.
I tried to get away and warn someone...
but they saw me.
They told me if I so much as whispered a word of what I'd seen...
..They'd take my mother.
They'd take her...
and they'd cut her throat.
Who was it?
I can't!
Tyr, please, tell me.
This is the only chance you have.
You'll be hanged if you don't...
And they'll kill my mother if I do.
Tyr...
..I can help you.
No.
If it means me dying instead of her, then so be it.
I'd rather die.
You went to the cells to see Tyr?
Yes.
We've been over this before, we know what he said.
The evidence doesn't lie.
No-one denies the crime, sire,
but the only part that Tyr played was to see it done.
He told you this?
Five minutes ago.
Then who was it?
He won't say, he's too frightened. They threatened him.
I must speak with him, at once.
Arthur, surely it can wait?
Gaius told you to rest, let your injuries heal.
I'll be fine, Guinevere.
I just want to hear what he has to say.
And you shall.
But Tyr's said all he's willing to say for now.
He's clearly frightened and unsure of what to do - don't push him.
Let him think it over
and maybe after a night in the cells he'll be prepared to say more.
As always, Guinevere...
you're right.
Have you noticed anything about Gwen of late?
Nothing unusual. Why?
I'm not sure exactly.
Something she's said? Something she's done?
No. It's nothing in particular.
It just seems to me that ever since she returned from the Dark Tower
she hasn't been quite herself.
Well, is that so surprising? She lost her only brother.
Elyan was all the family she had.
And grief changes people, Merlin.
I know that. I do, but...
Besides, we can only guess at what Morgana put her though.
That's what worries me.
Tyr.
What are you doing here?
Nothing to worry about. I just want to talk.
I've said nothing!
Come closer.
We don't want to be heard, do we?
I've told no names.
I've not mentioned you to anyone.
I believe you.
My mother's safe? You've not harmed her?
Your mother is alive and well. She's not the problem.
You are.
Me?
You see, Tyr, it's not what you haven't said.
It's what you may yet say.
Don't...
Understand?
The blade punctured his heart.
He suffered very little, I'm glad to say.
You've spoken to the night patrols?
They saw nothing unusual, sire.
What about the guards? Why didn't they raise the alarm?
Sire. We found this in a grate in the guard-room.
Clary wort. A powerful soporific, sire.
I've been a fool.
I should have spoken to him when I had the chance.
Arthur...
What?
Whoever did this was no stranger to Camelot.
They knew the Citadel inside out.
Guinevere.
The plan failed. Arthur lives.
Does he suspect you?
Not yet.
But the stable hand saw me.
He was going to tell them everything.
Was?
You have some good news then.
I did what had to be done.
With Tyr gone you have to find someone else to take the fall.
When Arthur dies you have to be beyond all suspicion.
You must have the support of the knights -
only with their allegiance will your path to the throne be clear.
But what good is all this?
Arthur's still alive.
For now.
By tonight you'll have everything you need to finish the job.
Arthur's doubled the guard, there are patrols night and day.
I can't risk leaving...
Gwen, Gwen.
It is I that will come to you.
Go!
Gwen?
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Arthur's been beside himself with worry.
Well, there was no need to worry,
I was just walking in the meadow.
Since Elyan died...
sometimes I just need time to myself.
I understand, but you should be careful.
A patrol was attacked in the woods only an hour ago.
Oh, I had no idea.
Thank you, Merlin.
I'll be more careful next time.
No broken bones, I'm glad to say.
Anything else you remember?
Nothing. One minute I was pursuing them through the trees.
The next I was flat on the ground.
You're sure it was sorcery?
Without a doubt. Powerful, too.
Morgana?
It's possible.
But why was she there?
Maybe she was meeting someone.
Why would she come so close to the Citadel?
Maybe she had to. Maybe
whoever she was meeting was here in Camelot.
Well, until we have more to go on this is idle speculation.
Gaius, Merlin - see what you can find in the woods.
Perhaps there's something we overlooked.
I'll go with them.
You'll do no such thing. You'll rest, Gwaine.
Physician's orders.
I don't think this is over.
What do you mean?
Whoever's responsible the attack on Arthur's life,
what's to stop them from trying again?
They haven't a chance, the Citadel's on full alert.
Every entrance, every exit's being watched.Trust me,
Arthur's safe as long as he remains in Camelot.
That's just it, what if he's not safe here?
What if Camelot's the most dangerous place that he could be?
Who could have had access to the stables,
who could have known the layout of the cells?
Who knew that Tyr would do anything to protect his mother?
You need to stay close to Arthur,
and do whatever you can to protect him.
You have my word on it, Merlin.
Who are you?
It matters not who I am,
but what I want and whether you can give it to me.
And what it is that you want?
A tincture. With the power to kill.
Not just to kill,
but to do so slowly and with the utmost pain.
Very particular, what you seek.
It has a very particular purpose.
Well?
Do you possess such a thing?
I do.
Here.
What are they?
Valerian. Two drops will render the victim unconscious.
And Henbane. A single drop administered through the ear.
Their death will be as...
prolonged and as unpleasant as could be wished for.
These are...uncommon things.
Hard to come by, hard to prepare...
Very generous, my lady, more than enough to buy my wares.
But not my silence.
Arthur, are you all right?
What if Merlin's right?
What if Morgana did attack the patrol?
Morgana?
She wants me dead.
What better way of achieving that
than conspiring with an ally within Camelot?
An ally who she couldn't risk meeting within these walls?
Who?
Whoever killed Tyr.
But that doesn't make sense.
If you're the target, why kill Tyr?
To protect their identity.
Perhaps.
Tyr's killer had an intimate knowledge of the palace.
Whoever they were, they must be known to me,
and they must be here as we speak.
If what you say is true, they must be found quickly.
And if they're not and strike again?
I will not let that happen.
I would lay down my life to protect you.
You'll find them, Arthur. You and I together.
Gaius!
Yes, that's certainly not natural.
It was Morgana, I'm sure of it.
Are you sure we're in the right place?
Gwaine said he spotted them somewhere around here.
There. On that branch.
It's not much to go on, is it?
Raw imported silk.
Traders ask a small fortune for it.
Whoever that belongs to is extremely wealthy.
What is that? Some kind of embroidery?
Indeed. Woven threads of silver and gold.
Only those of the highest rank can afford such a thing.
Merlin? Where are you going now?
Merlin?
Would you care to explain exactly what it is you're doing?
I was just checking for holes.
Holes?
Yes. That's where the hand goes.
Granted. But look...
That, I believe, is where the other hand goes.
Right. I'm just saying that you can't be too careful.
A lady's modesty is at stake, after all.
Is it now? Merlin, I would strongly recommend
you start showing a little less interest in Guinevere's clothing
and a little more interest in mine.
I think I prefer Gwen's.
I'm going to do everything in my power
to try and forget you ever just said that.
I suggest you do the same.
Just a few drops will ease your troubles, my dear.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Come on.
Are you prepared?
Have you found someone to take the fall?
Don't worry. I have someone in mind.
Guinevere. I was beginning to wonder where you were.
Sorry, I had some business to attend to in town.
I hope you have an appetite.
Mmm. And a thirst.
What took you into town?
Oh, just delivering supplies to those most in need.
Your kindness never ceases to amaze me.
Keep your grubby hands off of my dumplings!
You know, now that I think of it,
we never got to have our little celebration, did we?
Yes, why was that?
To us.
All the evidence suggeststhat the King has been poisoned.
You're certain, Gaius?
Quite certain.
The sweating, the corruption of the skin,
the traces of tincture around the ear.
They all point to the use of Henbane.
Is there no hope?
The poison is a deadly one, my lady.
There may be a way to arrest its course but I cannot guarantee it.
One thing I know for certain. Whoever did this lives among us.
Whoever did this has betrayed us all.
Someone who is free to roam this Citadel as they please,
someone who has access to the King's stables,
the King's prison...
..Even the King's food.
There is only one I know of...
Merlin.
How is Arthur?
There is no change.
I know how you must feel - about Merlin.
You must believe me when I say how sorry I am.
But the evidence against him is overwhelming.
You did what you had to do, Guinevere.
You had no choice.
I understand that.
Thank you.
Is there no hope, Gaius? None at all?
I will not lie to you.
Arthur's time is nearly upon him.
But until the King draws his last breath,
there is always hope.
You were right, Merlin. Whatever Morgana did in the Dark Tower,
she's taken control over Gwen and used her to get to Arthur.
Can you save him?
The poison is too strong, too virulent.
Your magic is his only hope.
You need to get me out of here somehow.
You promised you'd never leave me, Arthur. You promised.
He is our strength, our heart.
How can I live without him?
How can any of us live without him?
Because we must.
My lady. If Arthur is to die, we will lose more than that.
The kingdom will lose its King.
While Arthur lives, there is still a King of Camelot.
But when the time comes,
and it will surely come soon,
we need to be prepared.
If we do not have a leader
and a guide...
..Camelot and all the kingdom will be vulnerable.
Everything Arthur worked so hard to achieve will be threatened.
But who could wear his crown?
He has no family to succeed him.
And who among us is...worthy of such a thing?
You are, my lady.
Me?
You are as close to family as Arthur has.
No-one can deny your wisdom, your compassion and your loyalty.
I am certain that were Arthur able to make this decision,
he would choose you.
I don't know what to say.
I realise that this is a great responsibility
but you will not be alone.
I guarantee you, myself and all the knights will stand by you.
Now and forever.
Thank you, Leon.
I am lucky indeed to have such friends.
Who are you?
What kind of a damn fool question is that?
I am who I am and I am who I was and I am who I will always be.
That's no answer.
What other answer is there?
It's the only answer worth giving.
What are you doing here?
Incredible.
You follow one idiot question with another.
I'm visiting the cells, as you perfectly well know.
No, you're not. Not unless we say so, you're not.
But you already said so. Only ten minutes ago you said so.
You said so and I did so!
No, we didn't.
What on earth is wrong with you?
Something interesting in your tea, is there?
It's hardly any wonder your prisoners are being murdered
if you can't even remember
who you're letting in and who you're letting out. You let me in!
And I thank you for that.
And now, apparently, I have to let myself out. Ah!
Goodbye!
You! What are you doing in my kitchen?
Nothing.
Nothing means mischief in my book.
You've been reading the wrong book.
And mischief means theft.
No, it doesn't.
And theft means my pies.
Your pies?
Why on earth would anyone want to steal your godforsaken pies?
My pies are the talk of Camelot!
Oh, yes, indeed they are.
A crust like rusted iron,
a filling like last year's horse dung,
and the smell, oh, yes, just like the guardhouse's latrine!
No-one insults my pies and gets away with it!
Oh, I'm sorry! Should I speak instead of your poisonous flans?
Like vomit curdling in the noonday sun!
Or your dumplings!
The King himself likened them
to freshly-lain frogspawn wrapped in pig's snot!
What would you know about
the King and my dumplings?
Oh, good grief.
Should have done that years ago.
You there!
You! Halt!
There! This way!
He's gone. We've lost him!
Inform the men we have an intruder.
Put the Citadel on high alert.
That was no wind. That was sorcery.
Light the braziers!
Search the courtyard!
Are you all right?
Yes.
You haven't seen anything?
Heard anything?
Nothing. Why?
There's an intruder within our walls.
Here? In the Citadel?
Yes, my lady.
We last saw them in the Main Square, then lost sight of them.
My lady, you may be in danger.
Gwaine will take you to the guest chambers.
He'll ensure no harm comes to you there.
Why would anyone wish me harm?
You are to be our leader, Gwen. You are Camelot's future.
Do you imagine our enemies don't want you dead?
I can't leave Arthur, not now.
Gwen, I promise,
if there is any change, I'll fetch you at once.
Gaius is right. Come, my lady.
You're not safe here.
How on earth did you get in here?
Don't even ask.
How is he?
His heart has nearly stopped.
I fear he's close to death.
The sickness is so deep in him.
I don't know if I have the power to bring him back.
You can do this, Merlin.
Ic the thurhaele
thinu licsar
mid thamsundorcraeft
thaere ealdan ae!
Gaius...
Merlin...
Well done, Merlin! Well done.
You'd better get back to the cells before you're missed.
There are guards on every floor and stairwell. How can I get back down?
The same way you came up, obviously.
Obviously...
Morning, Merlin.
If you've got a moment, the King would like a word.
Merlin!
This is one of the two...
possibly three moments in my life
where I've actually been glad to see you.
That's my thoughts exactly, sire.
How're you feeling?
Like death. Well, death warmed up, at least.
I can imagine.
It seems like we've both been through something of an ordeal.
It wasn't so bad, really.
Once you get used to the eternal night and the rats,
the mouldy pillows, living with a bucket of your own...
Merlin.
I'm sorry about what happened to you. Truly.
As soon as I heard, I told them
it couldn't have been you who poisoned me.
I had the cook confirm your alibi.
Thank you.
I also told them you simply weren't bright enough
to organise an assassination attempt.
That's very thoughtful.
You're welcome.
Arthur...
There is something I need to talk to you about.
Sorry, Merlin,
another time. They're waiting for me in the Council Chambers.
Thanks to Guinevere, some new evidence has come to light.
The Queen found these vials in my chambers.
They bear, as you can see, a distinctive mark.
Thanks to her tireless efforts, she has been able to trace them.
This is your mark, is it not?
It is my mark, yes.
And what does this vial contain?
It...it's valerian, sire.
What does it do?
It renders the subject unconscious.
This one?
Henbane.
It's a poison, my lord.
A lethal poison.
And it is only thanks to the great skill of my physician
that I am still alive.
I'm sorry, my lord. I supplied it, I confess.
But I did not know it was intended for you.
In truth, I was...too afraid to ask.
Too afraid to ask who?
She who...procured it.
And did you recognise this woman?
Well, I cannot say for certain but I believed it to be Morgana Pendragon.
Because of the Queen's diligence, the truth has been uncovered.
Each and every one of us owes her a great debt.
Long live the Queen.
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen!
Long live the Queen...
You're not happy with your husband?
I'd be happy if he died tomorrow.
