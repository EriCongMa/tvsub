now ...
who can tell me the steps of a partial laryngectomy ?
in group settings ,
men are 75 % more likely to speak up than women ,
and when a woman does speak up , it &apos;s statistically probable
her male counterparts will either interrupt her
or speak over her .
it &apos;s not because they &apos;re rude .
cross . it &apos;s science .
the female voice is scientifically proven
to be more difficult for a male brain to register .
what does this mean ?
it means in this world ,
where men are bigger , stronger , faster ,
if you &apos;re not ready to fight ,
the silence will kill you .
this is killing me .
we have not moved in 10 minutes .
i swear that bumblebee has passed this car twice already .
it passed us , it circled the earth ,
and then came back around to pass us again .
yeah , because we left late because you overslept .
‭ not fun when you &apos;re driving and someone makes you late .
if you want to stay up all night
screwing around with some dude , i don &apos;t care
till you spend all morning complaining about it in my car .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
we share a wall .
so move out !
nobody told you you could crash in amelia &apos;s room , anyway !
okay , it &apos;s not amelia &apos;s room anymore .
what is that ? two fire trucks ? and three ambulances .
that &apos;s got to be like a four- or five @-@ car pileup .
50 bucks says a big rig &apos;s involved .
that &apos;s not a good idea .
let &apos;s go , karev .
screw it .
keps , i could use another set of hands here .
i &apos;m on it .
we &apos;ve been paging you for half an hour .
i &apos;ve been a little busy .
we got a 45 @-@ year @-@ old male with a head lac ,
positive loc on the scene .
also has abdominal contusion .
i &apos;d like to say it &apos;s not as bad as it looks , but ...
major pileup , multiple wounds .
a big rig flipped . bigger mess .
do you think he has intra @-@ abdominal injury ?
well , there &apos;s one way to find out .
all right , let &apos;s get her inside .
i got this . go .
a bony deformity in the temporal region .
5 centimeter head lac .
abdomen &apos;s clear .
palpable pulses in all four extremities .
we &apos;ve got mild pupillary asymmetry .
we need to get a head c.t.

yeah , hey , dr. warren here .
well , you did hit your head pretty good , lou ...
listen , we need a neuro consult down in trauma one .
... but we &apos;re gonna get you fixed up .
wasn &apos;t my most graceful landing , either .
yeah , sure . i &apos;ll hold .
pushing 150 of fentanyl .
this should help with the pain .
you know they had a wall at pike &apos;s market
covered in people &apos;s chewing gum ?
okay , well , when you do , send them down ,
okay ? i do , in fact , know that , lou . i grew up here .
thanks .
where &apos;s neuro ?
paged . no response .
well , then go get them .
any pain here , lou ?
just a little sore .
a little sore ?
he &apos;s lost his pulse !
all right , cover your ears .
why ?
that &apos;s why .
i want hourly neuro checks on bed 6,
sign off on beds 4 and 8 .

we &apos;re being paged to --
trauma 1 .
dr. grey .
and trauma 3 . dr. hunt .
both urgent , not critical . do want hunt first or grey ?
dr. grey told me to come find you .

meredith actually asked for me ,
or did she just want neuro in general ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t remember .
yeah , you do .
have grey give us a page if her patient becomes critical .
where &apos;s hunt ? trauma 3 , right ?

we &apos;re here . what have we --
possible concussion , head contusions ,
multiple blunt @-@ force blows to the head and neck .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s grey . i &apos;m sorry .
i thought you knew .
dr. shepherd ?
dr. shepherd .
dr. shepherd !
here &apos;s the films .
okay . pressure &apos;s 90 over 60 .
she &apos;s got a 30 % pneumo .
no obvious effusion .
she needs a chest tube .
i need a 36 tube , betadine ,
and 6.1 / 2 gloves .
set up the pleurovac .
just got labs . crit is stable .
oh , good . draw blood gas from the a @-@ line .
what is this ? what the hell happened ?
she was attacked by a patient .
the neck is bruised and swollen .
she needs an airway evaluation .
all right , i &apos;m on it , i &apos;m on it .
no bony deformity . positive battle &apos;s sign .
okay , meredith , we &apos;re gonna
have to put in a chest tube , all right ?
your lung is collapsing .
and this is gonna burn . i &apos;m injecting the lido .
you can &apos;t work on your family .
everybody in this damn room is her family .
it &apos;s fine .
here we go .
breathe , mer , breathe . breathe , breathe .
chest tube is in .
‭ okay , easy , easy , easy . easy , easy .
pulse ox is coming back up . 88 , 90 .
no evidence of traumatic brain injury .
no -- no -- no focal deficits .
uh , except --
uh , uh , dr. grey , i need you to move your fingers for me .
or your toes .
come on . just come on . wiggle something .
she responded to the painful stimulus .
it doesn &apos;t make sense ...
pulse ox is dropping again .
unless ...
the chest tube has a small air leak .
no , she has mild sub @-@ q emphysema .
we need to secure this airway and tube her .
got it .
guys .
guys . i don &apos;t think she can hear us .
what ?
what ?
are you sure ?
no .
mer .
i see evidence of barotrauma ,
possibly from the blows .
i think karev might be right .
i don &apos;t think she can hear anything we &apos;re saying .
her jaw is locked .
suction !
suction .
can we take a look ?
all right . let me see .
yeah , yeah , easy , easy .
yeah , we &apos;ve got a dislocation here , possible fracture .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re getting a tube in there .
you have to get a tube in . you have to preserve her airway .
or we have to trach her .
no , no , no . um ... all right , wait a second .
if i can reduce the dislocation ,
we can probably get her mouth open just enough to intubate .
it &apos;s gonna hurt like hell , though .
okay . hang tight .
i &apos;m sorry . here . okay , mer .
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to pop your jaw open , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry . i know . but we have to do it .
and we &apos;re gonna do this on the count of three , you guys .
ready ? 1 ... 2 ...
what &apos;s wrong , meredith ?
just get it out , get it all out .
the tears , all the ...
god , you &apos;ve got a lot of snot .
i &apos;m serious . i &apos;m for real .
i mean , you might have a serious condition .
‭ come on , woman .
blow your damn nose .
hang on .
mer .
can you hear me ?
you can hear me ?
you can hear me ?
oh , my god .
it is important that you continue the voice rest , okay ?
your tracheal injury is not ... fully healed ,
and your latest audiometry shows
that the hearing in your right ear has almost completely returned .
on your left , you &apos;re looking at about 55 % , which is good .
it &apos;s only been a few weeks , you know ,
so i &apos;m not concerned about it .
it &apos;s gonna come back , meredith , okay ?
i want you to continue to --
i @-@ i want you to continue
to move your fingers while in the cast ,
and you will remain non @-@ weight @-@ bearing on your leg
until we take the cast off .
yeah , there &apos;s a little swelling in that left leg .
it &apos;s probably local edema ,
but i &apos;ve ordered a doppler just to be safe .
anything else ?
no .
lou ? what &apos;s -- who &apos;s lou ?
the patient who attacked meredith .
i &apos;ve been calling him something else .
look , we don &apos;t have to go into that right now .
she wants to know . tell her .
okay .
lou suffered a severe epidural hematoma in the accident .
it &apos;s what caused the seizure .
we think he was in a postictal state when he attacked .
after a few minutes ,
he woke up and had no idea what he had done .
he had surgery and was discharged .
he &apos;s doing fine .
lou has reached out .
he has made a couple of requests to see you .
mnh @-@ mnh . i think ...
... he would just like to apologize .
it &apos;s okay .
she &apos;s kicking us out .
mm , mm . let &apos;s go .
go ahead .
apologize ? are you serious ?
of course i &apos;m serious .
yeah , i don &apos;t see why .
because the last time that woman
got hurt working for this hospital ,
she purchased this hospital .
that is why .
and what do you think will happen if she sees him again ?
nothing good .
exactly .
good , good .
all right . try and lift your leg for me .
good , good . decent mobility .
i don &apos;t know .
well , we &apos;re done , and it &apos;s all good , so ...
thanks .
uh , he has been working a lot of night shifts ,
and she &apos;s been ...
they haven &apos;t been talking , i don &apos;t think ,
or hanging or anything , from what i can tell .
so , anyway ...
let &apos;s do this again .
follow the pen .
okay , this isn &apos;t exactly the right shade ,
but it &apos;s doing a pretty good job of covering the bruising .
all right .
so ...
don &apos;t try and get up , okay ?
just let them come to you .
and smile .
but try not to open your mouth
because it &apos;s still pretty swollen in there
and the wires -- the metal wires --
they &apos;re a little scary .
you ready ?
okay , all right .
hey , hey , hey ! look who &apos;s here , guys !
your mommy is so excited to see you !
come here .
come on in . go ahead . go tell her .
tell her what we talked about , okay ?
i don &apos;t want to .
oh , come on , zola .
you ask me every day , &quot; when can we go see mommy ? &quot;
look . she &apos;s right over there .
go give her a big hug !
no !
no , no , no !
zo @-@ zo , come see mommy .
i want to go .
come on .
‭ zo @-@ zo , come see mommy , honey .
come on !
zo @-@ zo !
co see mommy , honey !
come on , honey !
come on , zo !
come on , honey . please .
zola , come on .
you know -- you know what ?
let &apos;s just , um -- let &apos;s do this later .
no . let &apos;s do this later . it &apos;s not --
no , no , no ! it &apos;s not okay .
come on , come on , come on , come on .
come on , come on .
let &apos;s do this later .
let &apos;s do this later . we &apos;re gonna do it later , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna do it later . okay .
okay , does anybody want anything yummy from the cafeteria ?
all right .
zola !
dr. robbins wanted --
come in here !
dr. grey .
okay , okay .
okay .
i can &apos;t breathe !
okay , you &apos;re okay .
hang on , hang on .
deep breath . deep breath .
i need you to breathe for me .
breathe for me , dr. grey .
breathe .
stay still .
stay still . i &apos;m gonna get you some air .
just stay still . i &apos;m gonna open you up , okay ?
okay . i &apos;m opening you up .
stay still . please .
‭ okay .
please . please . okay .
hold on .
all right . good .
hey , what the hell are you doing ? !
she -- she was having a panic attack . she couldn &apos;t breathe .
do you not realize how delicate the jaw actually is ?
dr. avery , she --
you could jeopardize the entire healing process here .
she couldn &apos;t breathe ! look at her !
she &apos;s been stuck in this room in that bed for weeks .
she can &apos;t move . she can &apos;t talk .
but i &apos;m her surgeon now , right ?
you can &apos;t come in here and just take out her wires .
she is my patient .
i know what i am doing !
you can rewire her jaw tomorrow morning ,
but right now , she needed some air ,
so i got her some damn air !
i brought you something to eat -- drink .
mm . i know . i &apos;m sorry .
good morning !
oh , come on .
or not .
how &apos;s the pain today ?
and the discomfort ?
well , her energy &apos;s up .
all right . i &apos;m sorry .
i have all of five minutes to update you on the miracle ...
that i &apos;ve been working on your service this week ,
but it seems like a bad time .
uh , i &apos;m gonna check in and update you later .
maybe we all could check in later .
yeah .
i &apos;m just gonna ...
leave that .
whoa . what happened ?
everything okay ?
nurses station .
yeah , okay . i got it .
you don &apos;t want to look at me .
i get it .
do you think that i want to be out there
hanging out outside your door
like some pathetic little rat looking for scraps ?
do you think that feels good for me ?
i @-@ i have been out there
trying to figure out how to make amends ...
as if that would matter to you .
i know i &apos;m a mess ...
who talks too much and feels too much ,
and i know that it drives you crazy ,
but that is the one way i know how to stay sober ,
and every time i try to suck it up and shut up
and just be cold and normal , i end up drunk ...
or on pills or at a funeral .
do you know what it felt like to walk into that trauma room
and see you on that table and think to myself ,
&quot; great . i did it again .
here comes another funeral . &quot;
you know what ?
forget it . i ...
i don &apos;t even know why i came in .
hello .
cross ...
let &apos;s get dr. grey a wheelchair .
* i got sunshine *
* on a cloudy day *
* when it &apos;s cold outside *
* i got the month of may *
* well , i guess you &apos;d say *
* what can make me feel this way ? *
i understand you saw amelia .
look , look , look . i know you &apos;re not in the mood for a lecture .
but ...
are you finished ?
she came to see you the night after the attack .
she was drunk .
she was upset ...
because you &apos;d called her for a consult that day --
the day of the attack .
and she had a choice
between coming to you and going to another trauma ,
and she went to the other trauma
because she was mad at you .
forgiveness is a powerful thing , meredith ...
... not only to make the other person feel good ,
but to heal you .
you need to forgive her , mer .
forgive her for not being derek ...
... for being the wrong shepherd ...
just enough to remind you of what &apos;s missing ,
but not enough to bring him back .
that &apos;s not her fault .
you need to forgive her .
you don &apos;t have to like her .
you don &apos;t have to love her .
but forgive her , okay ?
so you can forgive blake for being in that room
when a wrong decision cost you your husband .
to forgive derek for dying too soon .
to forgive yourself
for hating him for dying too soon .
let it go , meredith ...
... and forgive .
sun feels good on the face , doesn &apos;t it ?
what is the point of counseling , then ,
if you &apos;re just gonna suddenly , without even talking about it ,
just -- - oh , come on .
all we do is talk , april .
so , what ? you just -- you just -- just serve me papers ?
just like that ? just no warning , no -- no any--
do you have any idea what a slap in the face this is ?
are you kidding me ?
you ready ?
hi , dr. grey .
lou .
thank you for meeting me .
this is my wife , joanne ,
my daughter , kylie .
i told you about her -- the youngest , really smart .
and that &apos;s my anne .
um , have a seat , girls .
um , you got kids ?
right .

i wanted to ...
i didn &apos;t know what i was doing .

i didn &apos;t know .
i would never ...
i would never hurt a woman .
i ...
i just want you ...
i just want you to know that i &apos;m sorry .
truly sorry .
it &apos;s my 30 @-@ day chip .
i &apos;m sober .
and i &apos;m starting back at work on monday , so ...
i &apos;m trying .
i &apos;m trying .
i know you are .

yeah , this morning .
i &apos;m just not ready to forgive you yet .
i &apos;m not ...
... exactly ready , either .

mer .
let &apos;s go .
do you want anything ?
you know -- like a sandwich or a ...
or a blanket ?
all right , all right . i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
sit down , sit down .
i just spent six weeks in a bed , unable to speak .
when that happens , you see things .
there &apos;s a lot of things that people don &apos;t say to each other
that they should just say ,
so i need you to hear me when i say this .
i know i &apos;ve needed you a lot lately .
but i also know ,
and i have known for a long time
that jo loves you .
&quot; post @-@ it on the wall &quot; loves you .
don &apos;t ignore that .
you can have more than one person .
i used to think you couldn &apos;t , but now i know .
i mean , turns out i have a whole damn village .
so you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
go be with jo .
i &apos;ll be fine . i &apos;m okay .
don &apos;t let fear keep you quiet .
&quot; and the moon gave everything a magical glow
as if they were dancing on the milky way . &quot;
mommy .
yes ?
you have a voice .
so use it .
speak up .
raise your hands .
shout your answers .
make yourself heard .
whatever it takes .
just find your voice .
and when you do ...
... fill the damn silence .
