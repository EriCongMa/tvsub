gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i need your passion for social upheaval to help me
write the book about the upper east side .
would you prefer the kink
of watching your father do it with fake charlie again ?
no , i did not watch .
i got the hell out before they saw me .
as the new head of waldorf designs ,
i only have one chance to make my debut .
at fashion show for buyers next week .
please tell me that means
you &apos;re giving your serial to &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i know you need this to succeed as much as i do ,
but it &apos;s only gonna do that if you print it word for word .
done .
what do you want me to say ,
&quot; thank you for the humiliating experience
of being walked to school by my dad and his trophy girlfriend &quot; ?
&quot; gossip girl &quot; says your dad is dating serena van der woodsen .
is it true ?
not for long .
she know you can do this , miss blair .
i hope she &apos;s right .
my entire future ... here and with chuck
depends on it .
manhattan has weathered her share of storms--
heat waves , hurricanes , even an earthquake .
but these days , it looks like a new force of nature
is taking shape on the upper east side .
there &apos;s nothing i love more
than the sound of a sweatshop in the morning .
that hemline is too short .
and that one is too long .
my debut collection must be perfect .
we haven &apos;t been working day and night
for the last two weeks to make errors .
the devil is in the details ,
and i &apos;m about to start worshipping satan .
blair , here is the list of it girls
walking in tonight &apos;s show .
i am so glad charlotte casiraghi
agreed to be our centerpiece girl .
she is a veritable style icon
and the only monegasque who doesn &apos;t hold a grudge .
that is the genius of our strategy .
so what , we missed fashion week .
people always take their style cues
from real life it girls , anyway .
our buyers will clamor for the collection
the second they see it .
oui , blair , which reminds me ,
i &apos;ll go confirm charlotte &apos;s flight now .
miss blair , you have no moment for rest in days .
i bring you health shake with kale .
the only green that i &apos;m concerned with right now
is the shade of harem pants
lauren bush will be donning tonight .
quel desastre .
charlotte &apos;s lawyers say she has a conflict
with another endorsement .
they &apos;ve made her drop out of the show . what do we do ?
not to worry , jean pierre . i &apos;ve got this under control .
we &apos;ll just have to find someone even more fabulous
to feature as the face of waldorf designs .
thank you .
so , sweetie , what &apos;s on tap at school today ?
do you want some berries ?
i got &apos; em fresh at the farmer &apos;s market .
hey , if you wanna be rude to me ,
i &apos;ll put up with it as part of my parental duty ,
but there is no excuse to be impolite to serena .
ah , it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not .
sage , what &apos;s the deal ?
you &apos;ve been cutting school ,
and you dropped out out of all the activities
that used to matter to you .
our agreement was that you could date nate
if he didn &apos;t distract you from what &apos;s important .
please leave nate out of this .
hey . look at that .
she actually speaks .
you weren &apos;t around all summer ,
and now all of a sudden , you &apos;re the world &apos;s awesomest dad
trying to impress your trophy girlfriend ?
okay . wow .
i didn &apos;t know that you felt that way ,
but now that i do , let &apos;s talk about it .
hi , nate . no , it &apos;s a great time to talk .
well , there went your teachable moment .
you know , i just don &apos;t know what to do with her .
you know , her grades are abysmal .
college is right around the corner .
you know , i hate to say it ,
but maybe i introduced the two of you too soon .
well , speaking as someone who had a lot of stepparent types
waltz in and out of my life ,
i know it can be tough ,
but we &apos;ll make it through it , okay ?
i really , really want that .
well , it sounds like there &apos;s a &quot; but &quot; coming .
yeah . i just , you know , wonder if i ...
moved a little too fast here .
i @-@ i make no excuses for the way she &apos;s acting ,
but she &apos;s still a kid .
you know , if she &apos;s this upset , i need to deal with it .
well , yeah , you should definitely talk to her .
you know , i was--i was thinking more like ...
you know , maybe you and i should take a break .
you know , it &apos;s the last thing in the world that i want ,
but i should focus on sage , you know , get her--
get her back on track .
well , what if i talk to her ?
you did hear everything she just said about you .
well , yeah , but i know
how to relate to girls like sage
because i was a girl like sage not too long ago .
well , at this point she could hardly hate either of us more .
therefore , we have nothing to lose .
she &apos;ll come around , i promise . okay ?
okay .
i heard you on the phone earlier this morning .
didn &apos;t sound like blair .
deeper voice , darker mind .
my uncle jack .
his people on the ground in dubai
are helping me to find out who the mystery man
with bart in amira &apos;s photo is .
did he come up with anything ?
not yet . we got a partial plate off the car
tracked down the restaurant it was parked outside of .
so that &apos;s a good place to start asking questions .
well , that &apos;s good news . i mean , maybe someone in the area
will recognize him , you know ?
yeah , let &apos;s hope so .
i may be negotiating with terrorists ,
but you &apos;re harboring a fugitive .
come on , monkey .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry about that , man . he &apos;s , you know ...
no , chuck &apos;s barbs don &apos;t bother me .
anything beats having georgina watch me sleep .
i &apos;m just grateful for a place to crash .
well , as your roommate and publisher ,
i am pleased to report that &quot; the spectator &quot;
is finally ready to post its very first humphrey original .
it &apos;s a good day , and it &apos;s only 9 : 00 a.m.
before i publish , would you wanna warn the subject
of this week &apos;s serial ? you know , let &apos; em know
that they &apos;re about to be totally skewered ?
yeah . yeah , no . no , i &apos;d rather not .
are you sure ? i mean , this is kinda like
when you start sleeping with someone &apos;s ex .
it &apos;s better--better that they hear it from you first .
you should know .
so should you .
you think graydon carter makes a courtesy call
to the astors before publishing an expose on them ?
yeah , actually .
post it .
how &apos;s the invite list for the gallery opening coming along ?
speaking of , who will you be escorting ?
&apos;cause i have the perfect suggestion .
me .
well , i would love nothing more than to have you on my arm ,
but before we announce our relationship status
to the world , i have to tell my kids first .
jenny sent her blessing from london ,
but i still haven &apos;t connected with dan .
well , he &apos;d better hurry up and get back from europe
so i can officially be your girlfriend .
well , he was gonna do some traveling ...
after his writer &apos;s retreat ,
鲁弗斯 · 汉弗瑞的空中楼阁
but he should be back any day now ,
and i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll reach out to us as soon as he returns .
i wouldn &apos;t be too sure about that .
look at this .
so ... who is our new it girl ?
she &apos;s impossible to find .
i &apos;ve called all of our contacts .
this is manhattan . there &apos;s an it girl on every corner .
even on this corner ?
i can &apos;t walk in my show .
not you .
serena .
when i was in high school , my mom was remarried a lot .
that must have been so hard for you .
yeah , it actually was ,
and i learned the hard way that , you know ,
if you act out , you &apos;re only hurting yourself ,
so please just try to care about college
and stay involved in your extracurriculars .
you &apos;re so right , serena .
and they say you can &apos;t be pretty and smart .
and try to go easy on your dad , please .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s a really good man .
that &apos;s why i fell in love with him .
okay , now my ears are bleeding .
but it &apos;s cool to talk to someone my own age
who actually gets it .
i promise i &apos;ll turn over a new leaf .
thanks , serena .
hold on one second .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m not even going to pretend to be calling you
as a friend right now because you have made it quite clear
that you are not mine ,
but i do have a mutually beneficial business opportunity .
i highly doubt that .
i need a power it girl to walk in my show .
you made a splash at the central park conservancy gala .
i &apos;m guessing that you need something equally as exciting
to follow it up .
oh , well , your concern for my social standing
really tugs at my heartstrings ,
but a fashion show is hardly a life crisis .
it is to me .
my back is up against the wall ,
and not in a hot chuck bass kind of way .
you and i have known each other long enough
that we are like family ,
which means that we have earned the right to hate each other
from time to time , but that doesn &apos;t mean
that there &apos;s not still love underneath .
come on , serena .
please . how many times have i saved you ?
it &apos;s your turn to save me back .
i &apos;m saving someone else now-- steven &apos;s daughter sage .
my only focus is her and keeping her on track .
they &apos;re my new family .
maybe you should find a new one , too .
you know what ? if serena doesn &apos;t wanna be family ,
then that &apos;s fine . she can dive right from the gene pool
to the cesspool .
my mother is my family .
my mother ... is always watching ...
like the &quot; mona lisa . &quot;
like the &quot; mona lisa &quot; with a lot of expectations !
you look pale ...
like &quot; mona lisa . &quot;
this business is my namesake .
it is the family jewel .
it is what chuck paid my dowry to save !
if i &apos;m not successful at this ,
we might not even end up together !
we all root for you
to be ... blair ... waldorf @-@ bass .
i must match my mother &apos;s hard work ,
dedication , and success .
i can &apos;t let her down . i can &apos;t let chuck down .
can &apos;t let myself down .
they say history repeats itself ,
but looks like b. is charting a brand @-@ new course
to epic collapse .
excuse me . hey , have you seen this girl ?
are you serena ?
yeah . yeah . where is she ?
uh , you just missed her ,
but she did say you would take care of this .
hello ?
yeah , yeah , everything went as well as it could have .
she thinks just like i did when i was 17 .
it &apos;s like looking in a mirror .
it seems as if you &apos;re suffering
from severe exhaustion and dehydration .
have you been sleeping ? eating ?
do i look like i &apos;ve been eating ?
don &apos;t insult me .
miss blair running around like rhesus monkey .
she take no moment for sleeping
or eating or resting or stopping .
it &apos;s exhausting me , too .
i have been working harder than a farmhand ,
but i do have a multimillion dollar brand to build
and a fashion show to oversee tonight ,
so if you &apos;ll excuse me .
you &apos;re not going anywhere . if you wanna be at that show ,
you need to be on bed rest and i.v. fluids .
where did you find this quack ?
perhaps i am a wee bit tired .
i &apos;ll prepare the i.v.
i guess i &apos;ll just have to deal with running my empire
from my own sickbed .
oh , the state of your shirt
makes me think sage must be close .
yeah , well , you just missed her .
where could she have disappeared to now ?
i just searched every floor of barney &apos;s twice .
you try doing that without stopping to browse
at either of the shoe departments .
i think you should just give up the chase .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m supposed to be mentoring her .
you ? mentor ?
just go with it .
she may be 17 , but she is wise beyond her years .
she &apos;s high school you times ten , believe me .
but sage &apos;s entire goal is to destroy
mine and steven &apos;s relationship , and she &apos;s succeeding at it ,
because i &apos;ve been lying to him all day .
i &apos;m supposed to be keeping her on the straight and narrow ,
and i have no idea where she is .
well , if you feel so guilty ,
maybe you should just come clean .
i can &apos;t . if he knows that i messed this up ,
he &apos;ll wanna take a break ,
and that &apos;s the last thing i want .
he &apos;s the most important person in my life right now .
look , it &apos;s his job to handle her , not yours .
oh , you &apos;re right .
okay . as hard as it &apos;s gonna be ,
i think i just have to admit defeat .
well , good luck with that . i &apos;m around if you need to talk .
thanks .
you here on one of your famous blackmail missions ?
i hope you got it all on film .
suck it , humphrey .
you should probably button up your shirt .
you are editor @-@ in @-@ chief now .
i just can &apos;t figure out how dan found out about us .
i should have called him so he heard it from me .
he must be in shock .
oh , my god .
rufus , you are too good for your own good .
i mean , your son trashes you in the press ,
and you think you &apos;re to blame .
i mean , it was bad enough
when dan fictionalized you in his last book , but this is next level .
i need to talk to him immediately .
talk ?
isn &apos;t that what you did last time ?
and look how well that turned out .
i mean , he &apos;s using real names and distorting the truth .
it &apos;s libel .
these ad numbers seem pretty promising .
i think my serial might give &quot; the spectator &quot; a real boost .
yeah , and more importantly ,
judging by these online comments at least ,
the rufus piece has reached a whole new readership .
i mean , people who actually read--
over 35s who love vintage indie rock
and dirt on other people &apos;s divorces .
and since my dad isn &apos;t exactly in the &quot; gossip girl &quot; demo ,
there &apos;s no way she can undermine this story .
oh , come on .
this says your dad is gonna sue you ,
me , and &quot; the spectator . &quot;
and &quot; gossip girl &quot; is breaking the news .
jean pierre ? you are ruining everything .
the runway is the wrong color .
and who approved those wigs ?
even nicki minaj knows better .
we will change it all--
paint the runway , ditch the wigs .
is that nelly yuki i see in the background ?
she &apos;s there for her exclusive interview .
stall her . tell her she &apos;s pretty .
she &apos;s never heard those words strung together before .
it couldn &apos;t get worse , dorota .
i still haven &apos;t found my it girl ,
and now nelly yuki is sniffing around
like one of valentino &apos;s little dogs .
jean pierre should put a muzzle on her .
jean pierre thinks &quot; muzzle &quot; is the name of our d.j.
i don &apos;t know who else to call .
the minions are on probation because of poppy @-@ gate ,
and dan is still furious with me .
i just want someone who can read my mind .
is that too much to ask ?
hello , blair .
serena . your ears must be burning .
yeah ? why ?
i was just telling my dad
about the great opportunity you got me .
of course . the great opportunity .
you scored me a prime spot
walking in blair waldorf &apos;s fashion show tonight .
i did , and it &apos;s just so exciting .
who better for me to learn from
than a young businesswoman like blair ,
running her own company ?
i do applaud entrepreneurship .
this could lead to a summer internship
or maybe a whole career in fashion .
i was just happy to do anything
for--for sweet sage .
you know , this is great news .
my two girls &apos; getting along .
thank you . this means a lot .
you thought i ratted you out , didn &apos;t you ?
do you really think i care about your childhood baggage ?
i go to therapy . i have enough of my own .
hey , i was just trying to help .
how &apos;d you get a spot in blair &apos;s show ?
i didn &apos;t .
you &apos;ll get me in .
uh ... it &apos;s not that easy .
nothing ever is with blair .
well , then i &apos;ll just have to tell my dad
that i finally found my true calling ,
and you squashed it
by telling your b.f.f. not to hire me .
they say don &apos;t hate the player , hate the game .
but when you invented the rules , losing really stings .
i knew nobody keep you in bed except mr. chuck .
that &apos;s why i call him .
i would love to spend the day with you under the duvet ,
but you &apos;re exhausted .
and i know from my brief stint as a candy striper
that an i.v. can be quite a hindrance .
so how may i serve ?
i can &apos;t pull you away from taking down bart.
well , my hands may be momentarily tied
when it comes to my mission against my father .
task me , blair .
i can &apos;t . tasks are for minions or dan humphrey .
on second thought , i know exactly what you need done .
and i know exactly how you like it .
no instructions necessary .
dorota .
i &apos;m feverish !
elton john won $ 150,000 from &quot; the sunday mirror , &quot;
and all they wrote was
he was on some sort of diet
where he chewed his food but didn &apos;t swallow .
well , don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m pretty sure my father swallows .
dan , this isn &apos;t funny . this is exactly why i was saying
you should speak to rufus in the first place .
no , but this isn &apos;t like my father at all .
i mean , granted , nothing he &apos;s been doing
has really been in character ,
but i just don &apos;t believe he would sue .
the last thing he wants to do is tell the truth ,
the whole truth about
banging ivy dickens on my sofa .
that doesn &apos;t mean that he isn &apos;t gonna try to make a point
or get a settlement .
nate , look , if i-- if i know my dad ,
all he wants to do is give me a lecture
from his perch on mount @-@ holier @-@ than @-@ thou .
we &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll go talk to him , but just
try and take a deep breath and maybe a xanax or two .
so the show will open with this track .
here &apos;s a list of the rest of the set here
with time stamps .
chuck .
what do you think ?
i &apos;m speechless .
is it everything you desired ?
you read me like tea leaves , chuck bass .
it &apos;s jack . he has a lead on the man in the photo .
i have to--
go .
tonight will be ...
perfect because of you .
go find that man .
it means we &apos;re one step closer to being together .
go .
oh , the ice woman cometh .
i wanted to apologize about our conversation earlier .
i @-@ i know that i was way out of line .
save it , serena . what do you want ?
i need sage to be in your fashion show .
ironic , since i need a fabulous it girl
to walk in my show .
but sage is in high school .
sorry . can &apos;t help you .
this is your opportunity to discover sage .
look , karl found naomi . calvin invented christy .
people love a fresh , new face .
so what you &apos;re saying is that you wanna use me ,
your non @-@ family ,
to make a good impression on your new real family .
yeah . yeah , having sage in your show
will save my relationship with steven .
okay . i &apos;ll do it .
thank you .
on one condition .
for some reason , people care what you think .
so you will sit front row in vintage eleanor waldorf ,
applaud wildly , and gush to anyone who will listen
about how fabulous my new collection is .
done . you have a deal .
it was almost nice doing business with you .
sage , come meet blair . you &apos;re in .
oh , and stunning .
thank you .
tonight &apos;s gonna be amazing .
sage will be walking the runway .
steven and i will be sitting in front row .
but starting tomorrow ,
you &apos;re gonna start caring about some things , okay ?
i am ?
yeah , like attending school and after school activities
and making it home in time for curfew
and being so , so kind to your father .
do we understand each other ?
perfectly . i &apos;m so happy we &apos;re all getting along .
i have a feeling tonight &apos;s going to be very memorable .
careful , ladies .
turuns out sage might be a wolf in b &apos;s clothing .
eleanor will not be attending tonight &apos;s show
because she trusts me completely .
i feel honored to have earned that trust
and excited about the future of waldorf designs .
blair ? this way .
excuse me .
to sage &apos;s big night and to you for making this all happen .
oh , and to us and nothing standing in the way of our future .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
oh , of course , when i told you to speak with her ,
i imagine you igniting her interest in horseback riding
or , you know , maybe joining the volleyball team .
you know , modeling wasn &apos;t exactly
the ... after school activity i had in mind .
well , this isn &apos;t just about modeling , though .
i mean , blair has an incredible group of women
wearing her clothes ,
from activists to businesswomen to actresses .
sage is in great company .
okay .
serena . steven .
it is such a pleasure to have you here tonight .
welcome . and i &apos;m so glad that sage is in the show .
she &apos;s gonna be beautiful .
can &apos;t wait .
oh . look , i see , uh , anderson cooper over there .
excuse me . i should go congratulate him
on his old news becoming new news ...
if that makes sense .
let me show you your seat .
okay , well , i need a good view if i &apos;m going to applaud .
why isn &apos;t there a seat for steven here ?
serena , this is prime fashion real estate .
i had to save all the best seats for journalists
and influencers , not do @-@ gooding dads ,
but not to worry . steven has a very nice seat
behind you in the third row right there .
no , that is so disrespectful .
do you even care that we &apos;re here ?
well , of course i care .
you are so transparent , blair .
you couldn &apos;t have a seat for my boyfriend next to me
because you had to save it for one of your indentured minions .
well , th @-@ that &apos;s not true .
why even bother to make a deal with me
to have me fake @-@ clap when you &apos;ve already got one of your slaves
writing a fake story about how wonderful your line is ?
for your information ,
i &apos;m a very real &quot; women &apos;s wear daily &quot; reporter .
yes , nelly yuki , a very real reporter
who happens to look incredibly gorgeous tonight
and who i am thrilled to have sitting in the front row .
and ... i haven &apos;t the slightest clue
what fake deal serena is referring to .
nobody likes a fashion counterfeit .
you &apos;re right . i would never be caught dead wearing a knockoff ,
and if tonight really is about honesty ,
then maybe i will sit next to nelly ,
and i will give her all of my genuine opinions .
that &apos;s right . serena .
all your true , nice opinions .
nobody likes a debbie downer or a serena sabotage .
总是用消极眼光做评判
i &apos;m sorry that i didn &apos;t let you read it first .
that would &apos;ve been the honest thing to do .
and i &apos;m sorry that you had to find out about ivy
from someone other than me . but ...
we &apos;re together now ,
and , uh , admittedly , it &apos;s--it &apos;s getting serious .
w--dad , she-- she &apos;s a known con artist .
she swindled lily and her entire family .
and , you may remember from my article ,
she tried to have sex with me
and asked me to call her &quot; serena . &quot;
dan , you &apos;re my son ,
and we have to find a way to put this behind us .
but ... when it comes to ivy , you &apos;re way out of line .
i &apos;m an adult ,
and you need to respect my decision to be with her .
being with her is the adult decision ?
throughout my entire life ,
you have portrayed yourself as the moral compass ,
the guy who always does the right thing .
according to rufus humphrey ,
there &apos;s no road like the high road .
yes , i believe in doing the right thing .
so can &apos;t you see what you &apos;re doing with your life ?
your whole thing is a lie .
at least i wrote the truth ,
and the truth , which , by the way ,
is a defense against a libel , so you &apos;ve got no case .
case ? i don &apos;t want a case .
i just wanna have a real conversation with my son ,
so let me know if you see him around .
乔治娜
i will .
i gotta go .
that didn &apos;t sound like it went very well .
did you leak news that i was threatening to sue my son ?
i am definitely the luckiest guy in manhattan .
i look okay ?
you look amazing .
and if i spend any more time back here staring at you ,
that robe &apos;s gonna end up crumpled up in the corner .
so ... i &apos;m just gonna wish you luck and take my seat .
can it end up crumpled in the corner later ?
absolutely .
you know , this looks nice on you ,
but i think i have something serena might like even better .
come with me .
erica winograd !
it &apos;s great seeing one of my advertisers out on the town .
likewise , nate .
listen , i wanted to thank you for choosing
to advertise with us at &quot; the spectator &quot; this week .
it &apos;s been a real pleasure doing business with you and your team .
we were very excited about dan humphrey &apos;s inaugural serial .
we knew it would draw a lot of eyeballs .
and it has , and i know dan &apos;s piece next week will garner
even more attention .
you should definitely think about buying up some more space
for that one as well .
we did , nate , in &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
wait . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . what ?
dan &apos;s serial is continuing in &quot; vanity fair . &quot;
yeah , i thought &quot; the spectator &quot; was just a onetime occurrence ,
which is too bad for me
because graydon is charging ten times as much as you did
for ad space .
i &apos;m sorry , erica . i @-@ i have to go right now .
and different .
you know , it could work .
she pulls it off .
h @-@ have you guys lost your minds ?
this isn &apos;t fashion forward or provocative or couture .
it--it &apos;s exploitation , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
okay , alexa , it &apos;s your turn .
show must go on .
no one cares about one person &apos;s silly opinion .
so strut !
yep , i &apos;m out of here .
there &apos;s no way in hell i &apos;m going out there .
oh . don &apos;t go .
it &apos;s b &apos;s party ,
and she &apos;ll cry if she wants to ,
&apos;cause looks like this birthday suit
isn &apos;t exactly cause for celebration .
i only did it because i wanted to protect you .
no one ever stands up for you .
i thought if i ...
threatened a lawsuit on &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
&quot; the spectator &quot; would have to retract dan &apos;s piece .
standing up for me is one thing ,
but you shouldn &apos;t interfere in matters between me and my son .
i @-@ i apologize , rufus .
i wasn &apos;t thinking about the consequences ,
but dan did publish this piece to hurt you .
there are other ways to fight back , ivy .
no .
the only way to deal with the world of the upper east side
is to fight fire with fire .
dan may have been an innocent brooklyn boy once ,
but while you weren &apos;t looking ,
he became as ruthless
as any park avenue prince .
i &apos;m sorry
i inserted myself in your battle ,
but it broke my heart
to see you trashed so viciously .
well , his words may have been nasty ,
but dan wrote the truth .
we are together .
and i want you ...
by my side , here
and at the gallery opening .
why the hell do my advertisers think
that &quot; vanity fair &quot; is publishing the rest of your serial ?
because they are .
dan , we had a deal .
a handshake is hardly a deal .
oh , my god . i think i &apos;m gonna hit you .
i told you last week
it was a bad idea to mix business and friendship .
you wanted me to go to rufus before publishing the piece ,
and today when he-- when he threatened a lawsuit ,
you freaked out .
i was trying to protect my newspaper .
what do you want me to say ?
&quot; vanity fair &quot; is the big @-@ time ,
and the more readers i have ,
the more power i have .
it is that simple .
i thought we were in this together .
we were , and then something better came long .
okay , now i know i wanna hit you .
come on , nate .
you know you and all of your other friends
would &apos;ve done the exact same thing in my position .
you know what ? don &apos;t bother coming back to the empire .
find another place to stay .
i thought you might say that .
dave berger .
you used to work for bart bass a while back
as a bodyguard .
he fired me . i got nothing to say about that guy .
i just have a few questions about a weekend you spent
with bart in dubai , about four years ago .
like i said , i got nothing .
mr. bass makes everyone sign a nondisclosure agreement .
i don &apos;t know who you are ,
but i know better than to cross him .
think of me as a friend ,
a compadre , a fellow fighter .
this gym is pretty nice .
it &apos;s all right .
perhaps you &apos;d like to own it
instead of just working here .
personally , i &apos;ve always taken great pleasure
in being my own boss .
how could you do this to me ?
just because i didn &apos;t give your geriatric boyfriend a seat
doesn &apos;t mean that you had to tell sage to sabotage my show !
save it , blair .
you were so upset that
i care more about steven than your show
that you had to destroy my relationship .
i didn &apos;t tell her to take off the dress . you did .
no , i didn &apos;t .
i would much rather avoid the child pornography charges .
well , if i didn &apos;t tell her to take off the dress ,
and you didn &apos;t tell her to take off the dress , then who did ?
i happened to like the underwear more .
sage , you get in this car right now . we are going home .
i &apos;ll see you later .
looks like these besties were bested by a newbie .
when sage &apos;s dress came off , they both came undone .
steven , i &apos;m so sorry . it &apos;s all my fault .
she &apos;s right . it is all her fault .
she gave me all this advice
and told me to use her as a role model .
save it , sage .
i know you set serena up .
i should &apos;ve known as soon as you
started talking about the fashion show
that you were planning something .
serena isn &apos;t the one who should be apologizing .
it &apos;s you .
i &apos;m waiting .
serena , i &apos;m sorry that you weren &apos;t clever enough
to figure out what i was up to .
sage , i am warning you .
i apologize .
i shouldn &apos;t have taken advantage of you .
it won &apos;t happen again .
good .
now i &apos;m gonna contemplate your punishment
while i make us all some tea .
it &apos;s been a very long night .
for the record , i didn &apos;t mean a word of that .
i &apos;m not sorry at all .
well , for the record , i don &apos;t care .
why don &apos;t you just try to wrap your little machiavellian brain
around the fact that your father and i are gonna be together
no matter what you do ?
so you &apos;re gonna have to get used to me , sweetheart .
chamomile or mint ?
i just got off the phone with jean pierre .
it &apos;s a fashion prognosis of disastrous proportion .
not one buyer
has made an appointment to place an order .
and to make things worse ,
nelly yuki trashed me in &quot; women &apos;s wear daily . &quot;
&quot; can blair waldorf step into her mother &apos;s shoes ,
or is her achilles &apos; heel of the stripper variety ? &quot;
dorota , i have been relegated
to clear heels and kardashian tastes !
i always know this nelly a real snake .
it doesn &apos;t even matter if the clothes are good .
serena walked out , and everyone followed .
once again , i have been defeated
at the hands of serena van der woodsen .
she &apos;s the double @-@ edged sword of my very existence .
miss blair must keep chin up , must keep company going .
you will make miss eleanor proud .
i know because i proud already .
my mother . how am i gonna explain this to her ?
eleanor waldorf does not take kindly to the &quot; f &quot; word--
&quot; failure . &quot;
save the dom , chuck . i would rather die .
i am the laughingstock of the fashion press .
the clothes were beautiful , and you are beautiful ,
and that is something we need to celebrate .
you say celebrate . i say drown my sorrows .
give me the bottle .

that all happy families are alike ,
but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way ,
especially on the upper east side .
you know , sage can be a handful ,
but you handled tonight with true grace .
i &apos;m impressed .
some are only too happy to be distracted from their pain .
well , i had ...
an awful day with &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i had a really awful day with the serena .
i &apos;m not wearing my robe anymore ,
but my clothes can still end up in the corner .
i guess i could help you out with that .
while others choose to bite the hand that feeds them ,
even when they have no idea
where their next meal is coming from .
i heard you sold your serial to &quot; vanity fair &quot; this morning .
i can &apos;t believe they bought it ten minutes after it was posted .
you &apos;re very up on current events .
word travels fast in the publishing industry .
i guess you took my advice
and started playing by your own rules .
how does it feel ?
uh , weird .
kinda dirty but good .
like you said , the truth is a very powerful thing .
well , if you have nowhere to go ...
you can always stay with me .
are you dan humphrey ?
i am .
i read your piece in &quot; the spectator &quot; today
and i loved it . can i buy you a drink ?
absolutely .
so there you have it .
dave berger worked as a bodyguard for my father .
he was there that weekend with amira .
dave drove bart to meet someone
named lady alexander .
dave wasn &apos;t in the meeting , so that &apos;s all he could tell me .
i don &apos;t know who she is ,
what she does ,
or even where to start looking for her .
we will find her .
i &apos;m all yours ,
mind , body , and scheme .
you helped me with my show tonight ,
and , at least for the first few hours
before the big fashion fiasco ,
everything was perfect .
and i can help you , too .
let &apos;s face it .
we ... need each other .
i need you ... right now .
for one night , make an exception .
a gentleman ...
wouldn &apos;t take advantage of a lady who &apos;s had
more than her half of the bottle of dom .
but ...
the exception i &apos;ll make is this--
we join forces ,
combine our power ,
and achieve our goals that much sooner .
fine .
we &apos;re in this together .
and i will try with every fiber of my being ...
to behave .
but whether your family is happy or unhappy ,
it &apos;s always best to stick together
because some ties are simply unbreakable .
