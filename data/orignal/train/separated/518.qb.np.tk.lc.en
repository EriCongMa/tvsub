the night watch
when we spoke last , you were talking about the summer
that you ran away from home .
why don &apos;t we start with that .
uh , sure .
i wasn &apos;t really sure what was left for me back at home .
i thought i had learned all that i could there .
um , it was time , uh , broaden my classroom .
and that &apos;s when i met susie johnson .
the first of your victims ?
yes .
what did it feel like when you were killing her ?
nothing special .
i have trouble believing that , leonard .
how come ?
well , you killed 14 of them .
that you know of .
my point is that something drove you to keep killing ,
so you must have felt something .
it was just a thing i did , you know ?
people do things every day .
i , um , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d still be up .
still up .
did you eat ?
no .
me neither .
why don &apos;t i make us
some huevos rancheros .
tara .
don &apos;t worry . i will dial back the jalapenos this time
so i don &apos;t blow off the top of your head like mount st. helens .
stop . just ...
stop .
look , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late , doug .
we just got on a roll and i lost track of time .
it &apos;s research , ok ?
it &apos;s necessary .
wouldn &apos;t want to get in the way of what &apos;s necessary .
look ,
doug .
these interviews with ennis ,
these late nights , this is important work ,
all right ? it &apos;s meaningful work .
i am trying to take
serial killer profiling protocol to the next level .
you &apos;re more interested
in a guy who killed a bunch of little kids than you are in me .
um , i have to be in to the office
first thing in the morning ,
so could we talk about this at dinner tomorrow night ?
there &apos;s nothing more to talk about .
i &apos;m going back to san francisco .
what ?
my flight leaves tomorrow afternoon .
and you &apos;re just announcing this ?
things haven &apos;t been good with us for a while now .
ok , uh , i thought
the point of a relationship
was that you work through your problems ,
not ... hop on a plane and leave .
i can see i was mistaken .
thank you for
keeping it real for me , doug .
have a nice flight .
so yogi berra arrives at spring training
and the equipment manager says to him ,
what &apos;s size cap do you wear ?
and yogi says , &quot; i don &apos;t know ,
i &apos;m not in shape yet . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s the joke .
but studies have shown that dimensional changes
in the human head actually can fluctuate ,
especially in the third decade of life .
morning , guys . how do i look ?
you look great .
went on a diet last night , lost 185 pounds .
what do we have ?
ok , you know the phrase &quot; art imitates life &quot; ?
this is like that but a dead version .
this happened last night in detroit .
and if i can direct your attention to the signature .
is that morpheus ?
who ?
he &apos;s a prolific street artist
who &apos;s been active since the summer of 2007 .
he began using primarily
stencils and wheat paste , but in recent years
he &apos;s moved on to more site specific installation work .
the kicker-- no one knows who morpheus really is .
like that british graffiti artist ... what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ face ?
banksy .
that &apos;s the one .
this is the only known photograph of morpheus .
this was taken 7 years ago in los angeles .
no , that &apos;s no help . that could be anyone .
do we know who the victim is ?
yeah . russell pearson . he &apos;s a community activist
who &apos;s been in the local news a lot
for opposing a controversial development project
that &apos;s supposed to revitalize the downtown area .
what &apos;s so controversial about the project ?
gentrification . lower income
residents are displaced by luxury condos .
good bet the only thing being revitalized
are the developers &apos; bank accounts .
morpheus has always sort of been the voice of the underdog .
i &apos;d assume that he and pearson
were on the same side of this issue .
normally , yes , but pearson , 3 days ago ,
was in the news again for all the wrong reasons .
he was accused of taking bribes from the very developers
he was organizing against .
so this could be a dose of street justice .
has this morpheus ever committed
an act of violence before ?
no , he &apos;s always advocated for civil disobedience .
well , how do we know it &apos;s even him ?
morgan &apos;s right . morpheus may beat the war drums ,
but so far that &apos;s all he &apos;s done .
regardless , tensions are already high in detroit ,
and this is only going to make things worse . wheels up in 20 .
&quot; ghosts were created
when the first man woke in the night . &quot;
j.m. barrie .
between his activism and bribe @-@ taking ,
russell pearson had no shortage of enemies .
well , morpheus isn &apos;t too subtle with his symbolism .
you stick your nose in the cookie jar , you pay the price .
how long has morpheus been in detroit ?
oh , i can answer that question .
morpheus first popped up in the city 6 weeks ago .
i &apos;m sending video to your tablet right now .
vehicle as barbecue . what &apos;s that about ?
there was a heatwave in detroit in august
and a homeless woman and her child
locked themselves in a car to sleep
and died of dehydration .
morpheus has done two more pieces .
the second one he took credit for ,
but it was dismantled by a rival artist
before anyone could see it .
didn &apos;t realize it was that cutthroat .
yeah , competition among street artists is intense .
it &apos;s like turf wars .
well , according to this , morpheus has a website
where he always posts his work .
yeah , that &apos;s right . he doesn &apos;t post any comments .
it &apos;s through a proxy server , so it &apos;s impossible to trace .
he took credit for the first 3 pieces in detroit ,
but there &apos;s been nothing on
the website about the russell pearson murder .
because he didn &apos;t do it ?
or because this time it involved murder .
oh , no .
what is it , garcia ?
uh , something is terribly wrong .
a child &apos;s been abducted in detroit .
corinne wallace , 8 @-@ month @-@ old daughter
of stuart and katherine wallace .
stuart wallace is one of the developers
behind the urban renovation project .
and there was graffiti and morpheus &apos; signature
on the walls of the baby &apos;s nursery .
has there been a ransom demand ?
i don &apos;t know . it just happened like 30 minutes ago .
all right , when we land , dave , you and lewis
go to the abduction site . morgan ,
see if you can locate the rival artist
who took down morpheus &apos; work .
reid and i will go to the p.d. , we &apos;ll contact
the regional card team and get set up there .
and , garcia .
yes , sir .
your sole job is to find out the identity of morpheus .
use every resource you have available .
finding him is our best chance of finding the child .
we &apos;re grateful for your assistance .
we &apos;ve got an amber alert and tip line set up .
and the bureau &apos;s child abduction rapid deployment team are on their way .
got the video from the baby monitor cued up in my office .
thank you . i understand both parents were home
at the time of the abduction ?
that &apos;s right . the maid , too .
and no one in the neighborhood saw anything unusual ?
no . happened in grosse point where the homes
tend to be on large secluded lots .
in this case , the family being wealthy works against us .
ok , our guy comes in now .
creepy how he plays with the baby .
we did a photographic
comparison of the signatures at both crime scenes .
they appear to be authentic . it looks like morpheus is our guy .
i was in my study right down the hall .
right there , 30 feet away .
i know it &apos;s hard , mr. wallace .
we appreciate you talking to us .
if we could , we &apos;d also like to talk to your wife as well .
katherine &apos;s upstairs in the nursery .
the police said it was ok .
if anything &apos;s happened to our little girl ...
you can &apos;t blame yourself .
the hell i can &apos;t .
i should have seen something like this coming .
why ? did you have reason to think she might be in danger ?
not her specifically , but my property was vandalized
and then pearson turned up murdered .
i should have moved my family out of town ,
you know , hired more security , something .
wait , your house was vandalized .
my business . i &apos;ve got a storage facility downtown
and that guy they call
morpheus put graffiti all over it last week .
even put it on his website .
who is he , anyway , morpheus ?
how can somebody just not exist ?
he does exist .
and we &apos;re gonna find him .
the maid said the doors to the house were locked .
that &apos;s right . they &apos;re always locked .
mrs. wallace , i know this is difficult ,
but did you hear or see anything unusual ?
corinne &apos;s giraffe .
ma &apos;am .
corinne &apos;s giraffe . it isn &apos;t here .
are you sure ?
she &apos;s right .
it &apos;s always in her crib . it &apos;s her favorite toy .
he took it .
that man took corinne &apos;s toy .
oh , honey .
he wouldn &apos;t do that if he was gonna hurt her , would he ?
take her favorite toy ?
it &apos;s a hopeful sign , mrs. wallace .
you should try to get some rest .
come on , sweetheart .
what have we got ?
i &apos;ve been working with garcia to track the locations
of morpheus &apos; street art over the past 8 years .
this is a geographic timeline i put together .
is there a pattern ?
not really . he mainly just criss @-@ crosses
between los angeles and new york .
he &apos;s never really in one place for a very long time .
there is a higher concentration of activity
along the gulf coast of florida , though .
that could be some sort of home base .
what are you looking for ?
i noticed in morpheus &apos; early work
there &apos;s a synthetic cubist
spatial construction reminiscent of de kooning .
so you &apos;re thinking he had some formal art education .
exactly . and i &apos;m hoping to be able to track it
to a specific university or school of training .
good .
well , it took a while , but i finally tracked down
the artist who took credit for dismantling morpheus &apos; work .
markus ivey .
he &apos;s on his way in for questioning now .
anything on the missing baby ?
not yet .
what &apos;s this guy thinking ? murder , kidnapping a child .
he had to know that law enforcement
was gonna come down on him like a ton of bricks .
it &apos;s got to be personal .
i &apos;m just curious as to if
morpheus intends to remain anonymous after this .
if he doesn &apos;t , it &apos;s got to be an endgame ,
and whatever it is , consequences don &apos;t matter .
what &apos;s up , markus ?
i &apos;m ssa derek morgan . i just want to ask you a few questions .
i didn &apos;t kill pearson and i didn &apos;t take the baby .
i got a gallery opening tonight . are we done ?
no . we &apos;re not done .
have a seat .
i &apos;ll start with the obvious .
do you know morpheus &apos; identity ?
no . nobody does .
why &apos;d you take his artwork down two weeks ago ?
a better question is , why &apos;d he put it up to begin with ?
let me tell you about morpheus .
this dude comes swooping on in anytime there &apos;s a photo op .
every issue is suddenly his issue .
not here .
this is my city .
detroit &apos;s own can take care of detroit .
how &apos;d you find him before anybody else did ?
what do you mean ?
morpheus assembled his artwork in the middle of the night .
remote location .
how &apos;d you stumble upon it first ?
he &apos;s gone predictable , that &apos;s how .
what he &apos;ll do , where he &apos;ll do it .
his routine &apos;s tired . it &apos;s played out .
really ?
i was kind of under the impression
that he was a really successful guy .
more successful than you .
like the expression goes ,
time will tell .
did you ever think that
somebody else might just be setting him up ?
no . why would i ?
well , he seems like a pretty easy target , right ?
with the secrecy and all .
are you saying you don &apos;t think he did any of this ?
markus , i &apos;m just having a real hard time
seeing the upside for him
to suddenly start kidnapping and killing .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
upside is people start paying attention to him again .
the man is desperate .
lost his edge .
morpheus ain &apos;t nothin &apos; to anybody anymore .
so you think this is all just a publicity stunt .
what i think ...
all this stuff now ,
that &apos;s morpheus trying to stay relevant .
as crazy as it sounds ...
it just might work .
garcia &apos;s slowly chipping away .
she picked up a money trail from florida
to some of morpheus &apos; known locations in the past .
no viable leads , no ransom demand .
i mean , if it &apos;s not about money , then what ?
why else do children get abducted ?
normally with an infant this young ,
we &apos;d consider maternal desire .
but it doesn &apos;t really fit in this case .
and then there &apos;s human trafficking ,
but then why bother leaving art behind ?
that , and the wallace baby &apos;s too high @-@ profile .
traffickers usually prefer below @-@ the @-@ radar victims .
just got a call from markus ivey &apos;s manager .
he never showed for his gallery opening tonight
and she wanted to know if he was still here .
we cut him loose hours ago .
i told her that . she gave me the address
of a private studio he keeps .
sounded pretty worried .
let &apos;s check it out .
rossi .
thanks . the wallaces confirmed
the stuffed animal is the one missing
from their daughter &apos;s nursery .
this is a major shift in m.o. ,
behind closed doors instead of out in the street ,
nothing overtly political .
it almost feels like some sort of taunt .
elaborate staging this time , too .
the lullaby , the empty bassinet .
there &apos;s no doubt this is personal .
it &apos;s not about gentrification . this is about the baby .
absent child . the abducted baby
could be a projection of the unsub himself .
markus had to know something .
or not . he might have just been an unwilling participant
in a bigger endgame .
reid , do you have the photographs of morpheus &apos; artwork ?
thanks .
the signatures match .
wait a minute .
what do you see ?
morpheus is always extremely precise with his signature .
it never varies .
it looks the same to me .
but it isn &apos;t .
the bottom of the &quot; u &quot; never
intersects the &quot; s &quot; in the mobile signature .
and look--the lower two horizontal bars of the &quot; e &quot;
fall just short of the left side of the &quot; u &quot;
and the alignment of the &quot; m &quot; is marginally off .
this is not morpheus &apos; signature .
a forgery ?
that &apos;s what i think .
that means the signatures in the nursery
and the russell pearson crime scene are probably also forgeries .
ok , well , that brings us back to our set @-@ up theory .
so who would have a motive to frame morpheus
for both the kidnapping and the murder ?
someone with an axe to grind , a grudge .
is there another rival artist like markus ivey ?
you know , i keep going back to the fact
that ivey knew the location of the morpheus work beforehand .
he told morgan that it was because morpheus
was becoming predictable , but i don &apos;t buy it .
what if markus ivey was tipped
by someone who actually did know morpheus ?
like who ?
i don &apos;t know , but think about it .
for morpheus to stay
underground year after year , he &apos;s gotta have help .
garcia .
‭ yes , sir ?
i need you to start a parallel search
for a possible associate of morpheus .
ok , sure . i love parallel searches .
you should know that the original search is not going well ,
and i would really appreciate it if you guys
would put your noggins together
and give me a nudge in how to proceed .
ok , well , this person would follow the exact geographical timeline
that you built for morpheus .
we think the unsub might
have his home base on the gulf coast of florida .
see if any money from the various locations
in your geo @-@ profile was wired to or from there .
that &apos;s a beautiful nudge . thank you .
in morpheus &apos; first art piece in detroit ,
we found a distinctive blue chalk spray
with a uv @-@ resistant fixative .
he used the same material in new orleans several years ago .
i &apos;d check to see if he ordered it from the same outlet
含防紫外线固定剂蓝色粉笔喷雾 全国供应商
or found a similar source nearby .
uh @-@ huh . keep that coming .
this possible associate hasn &apos;t announced himself either .
it means he may have reason to hide .
cross @-@ check any names you get with those who have done prison time
or have outstanding warrants .
ok . i am on it , she said with confidence .
ok .
let &apos;s get back to the p.d. we have a lot of work to do .
there have been corinne wallace sightings
from mexico to nova scotia .
people are well meaning , but ...
how are the parents ?
well , it &apos;s been tough .
they &apos;ve gone to a hotel to try to get some sleep .
that &apos;s strange .
what is ?
the markus ivey crime scene and the bassinet next to the body .
there &apos;s a small blue blanket .
what about it ?
i &apos;ve seen it before . here .
in the car barbecue art .
what is it , garcia ?
i got it . morpheus &apos; associate or assistant or whatever .
corey marlin .
what makes you so sure ?
well , you said gulf coast of florida .
he &apos;s from tampa . he was in prison for 4 years
for beating a guy half to death in a bar fight .
he has a bunch of outstanding warrants from forever ago .
when he was in prison , he took up painting .
he said he wanted to become an artist .
ooh ! and the timeline matches , too .
marlin fell off the face of the earth in 2007
right when morpheus showed up .
if morpheus has an associate , this has gotta be our guy .
never mind associate . could corey marlin actually be morpheus ?
oh , well , that &apos;s doubtful .
marlin &apos;s work may have wowed &apos; em in cell block c ,
but he doesn &apos;t have the artistic chops that morpheus does .
he did , however , wire money from an account in sarasota
to locations that match the movements of morpheus .
every week like clockwork , up till 3 weeks ago .
maybe the association ended .
at the same time the killing began .
{ \ fn微软雅黑 \ fs14- i &apos;m sending all this to you right now .
thanks , garcia .
an amber alert has been activated
in the search for missing 8 @-@ month @-@ old corinne wallace
who was abducted from her family &apos;s home
in grosse pointe yesterday morning .
a primary suspect in the apparent kidnapping has emerged .
corey marlin of sarasota , florida .
the public should exercise caution ,
because police say marlin has a history of violent behavior
and should be considered armed and dangerous .
a tip line has been set up at detroit police headquarters ,
and anyone with information on the baby or corey marlin
is urged to call .
it took me a little while to find them .
this one &apos;s from the markus ivey crime scene .
and this one is from the burnt @-@ out car art piece
morpheus did a couple months ago .
it &apos;s two halves of the same blanket .
it &apos;s weird , though .
i mean , we know morpheus was responsible
for the burnt @-@ out car art piece .
his signature was real and he claimed credit for it
on his encrypted social media site .
but the markus ivey murder was done by an imposter .
so how did two pieces of the same blanket
end up in both locations ?
corey marlin would have had access to morpheus &apos; materials .
agent hotchner .
there &apos;s a call about the missing baby .
i think you should take this one . it &apos;s on line 3 .
hello ?
is this agent aaron hotchner ?
who is this ?
if you want to find the child , go to 325 west warren .
who is this ?
325 west warren .
you have 30 minutes .
lewis , let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s a login code .
agent hotchner .
who &apos;s this ?
this is morpheus .
do you have corinne wallace ?
no . that &apos;s why i wanted to speak with you .
i want to help .
how do we know you &apos;re the real morpheus ?
right now all you need
to know is that i would never hurt a child .
this is agent lewis .
you &apos;re asking us to take a lot on faith .
why would i intentionally expose myself to the fbi ?
i came to detroit two months ago .
i &apos;ve only made 3 works since i &apos;ve been here .
i don &apos;t know who killed those men or who took the baby .
is there anyone else who could have access to your art materials ?
nobody .
not even corey marlin ?
did he commit these crimes ?
absolutely not .
you seem pretty certain .
i know him . he was my partner .
but the partnership &apos;s over .
yes . why do you want to know about my materials ?
you used a piece of blue blanket
in our first work in detroit .
what is this about ?
we have the other piece of that blanket .
it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s true .
i &apos;ve told you enough .
we certainly hit a nerve .
what are you thinking ?
what struck me was the concern for the child
above all else .
and did you notice the cadence in the speech pattern ?
i think morpheus is a woman .
hey , talk to me . any progress , baby girl ?
morpheus as a female helps ,
but there are over 50 women in the gulf coast
that went missing during that time period .
did any of these missing women
have an art school background ?
negative .
well , keep checking .
art galleries , museum employees ,
elated fields like graphic design .
ok . i &apos;m all over this .
you know , corey marlin still could be our unsub ,
despite what morpheus says .
there &apos;s another possibility here .
morpheus is the unsub , has always been the unsub .
because ?
morpheus &apos; career has been about manipulation .
you look that way , i &apos;ll go this way .
rossi , you really believe that ?
no . i still like corey marlin for it .
when in doubt , go with the guy with the long prison record .
it &apos;s been over 30 hours since corinne wallace was taken .
we &apos;re running out of time .
corey marlin turned up dead in a downtown motel ,
bound and shot . body shows signs of torture .
any sign of the wallace baby ?
no . and no evidence of the child ever having been there .
i &apos;ll have agent morgan meet you there .
you know , this could be morpheus .
she and corey had a falling out ,
she knows that we &apos;re onto corey ,
corey can reveal her secrets .
the torture doesn &apos;t make sense .
she didn &apos;t convey that level of suppressed rage .
well , then it has to be someone looking for information .
corey seems the only person
that could tell morpheus &apos; whereabouts .
morpheus hung up on us when i mentioned the blue blanket .
that stopped her cold .
wait a minute .
wait , look at this .
this one is slightly more faded
and it &apos;s a little more worn out .
it &apos;s subtle , but it would take years
for cloth to degrade like this .
whoever cut this blanket did it a long time ago .
they should be exactly the same , but they &apos;re not .
morpheus came to detroit two months ago . why then ?
the condo development controversy ?
i don &apos;t think so . that &apos;s been an issue here for a while .
something else triggered her arrival .
well , then what happened two months ago ?
the mother and child died in the overheated car .
and that was morpheus &apos; first piece of art in detroit ,
the one that she used her half of the blanket in .
garcia .
yes , sir .
of all the women on your list , did any lose a child ?
uh , 3 did .
and of those 3 , did any of those children
die between 2005 and 2008 ?
mm @-@ hmm . ellen clark .
she lost her 3 @-@ year @-@ old son 8 years ago .
that coincides exactly with the emergence of morpheus .
and what were the circumstances of the child &apos;s death ?
awful . it was a drowning accident
in a lake near nokomis , florida .
oh , sir ! it has got to be ellen clark .
she briefly audited courses
at the glenbury school of art and design in sarasota .
and what about the father ?
william cochran , who was a teacher there when she was a student .
that &apos;s how he and ellen must have met .
he might have been her mentor .
cochran was not at the school for very long .
he was fired after an altercation with another faculty member ,
and he underwent a mandatory psych eval .
so there were indicators of mental instability from the start .
what happened to him ?
after his son charlie drowned ,
william cochran did some drowning of his own in alcohol ,
and then he wound up on the street for a while .
and where is he now ?
he moved out of state a few years ago .
looks like he &apos;s been working as a handyman ,
trying to put his life back together ,
in waycross . georgia , where he lives .
what is it ?
william cochran is on the move .
he cleared out his bank account 9 days ago .
he booked a one @-@ way ticket to detroit .
i &apos;m sending his photo and ellen clark &apos;s to you right now .
thanks .
shh ... quiet .
look , i brought you a present .
don &apos;t cry . you &apos;re gonna make mr. turtle sad .
it &apos;s almost over now .
well , we sent ellen clark and william cochran &apos;s photo
to every hotel in the greater detroit area and nothing yet .
ellen and william lose their son
and then things go downhill for william .
so did he grab the wallace baby
so they could start all over again with a brand @-@ new child ?
i &apos;m going in a different direction .
the drowning of the child ended the relationship .
william and ellen each took
half of the boy &apos;s blanket as a memento , a keepsake .
but when william saw it show up in ellen &apos;s art piece , he flipped out .
to him that was crossing the line .
and then he headed straight to detroit .
to take revenge on her .
but before killing ellen ,
he had to destroy the legacy of morpheus ,
taint it with murder .
yeah , but then why take the baby ?
i don &apos;t know .
to remind her of the loss of their own child maybe .
and then he tracks down corey marlin
and tortures him to find out where ellen is .
and hopefully corey didn &apos;t talk , because if he did ,
ellen could be in some serious trouble .
it &apos;s been a long time , ellen .
it &apos;s been a long time .
william cochran &apos;s not registered at any hotel or motel ,
at least not under his own name .
he could have some sort of short @-@ term rental .
or moved into some abandoned space . there &apos;s plenty of those .
but he does have a child with him .
he &apos;s gotta be careful .
he &apos;d also need a space big enough
to build his art pieces .
if he came here searching for ellen ,
he probably set up shop in one of the two artsy areas of town ,
but which one ?
if he left his car in georgia ,
he &apos;d need access to public transportation .
within walking distance of stores for his daily needs .
and the baby &apos;s .
he was very gentle with the baby when he took her ,
and if she at all represents the child he lost ,
he &apos;ll continue to take care of her .
proper baby food , diapers ,
maybe a temporary playpen of some sort .
in the two arts districts , this one &apos;s mostly just warehouses ,
but this one definitely has a store or two .
i &apos;ll have photos of cochran
distributed to all the local shopkeepers .
the baby , is she ok ?
the baby &apos;s fine .
you need to give her back .
it &apos;s a shame that you didn &apos;t care as much about our own child .
maybe charlie &apos;d still be alive .
what happened to charlie was an accident .
he was lying at the bottom of a lake ,
while you were busy painting .
it all happened so fast .
i was sketching .
i looked up and he was gone .
why did you do it ?
charlie &apos;s blanket .
you stuck it into that piece of art ,
like it was some junk you buy in a thrift store .
i did it to honor the homeless child that died in that car .
and to honor charlie .
that &apos;s a strange choice .
but life is just a series of choices , isn &apos;t it ?
stare at a sketch pad
rather than watch a child at the water &apos;s edge .
you sit down !
let me tell you what &apos;s gonna happen today .
i &apos;m gonna give you one last choice to make .
