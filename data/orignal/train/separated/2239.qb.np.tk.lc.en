第十三集
once upon a time , an evil queen
banished every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known
to our world .
who knows the truth and who can break the spell ?
you don &apos;t play with the curse .
my book .
why &apos;d you bury it here ?
so my mom doesn &apos;t find it .
when people are supposed to be together ,
they find a way .
the reason i go to granny &apos;s is to see you .
you &apos;re gonna tell him you don &apos;t love him .
or you &apos;ll kill me ?
i &apos;ll kill him .
my book ! it &apos;s gone !
princess abigail ,
your beauty grows with each passing day .
it is an honor to have you join my family .
thank you , your majesty .
let &apos;s go !
is everything okay ?
just the excitement of the royal wedding .
we want to ensure the safety of our guests .
so if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
find him .
go around ! go !
split up !
chicken &apos;s delicious .
david , there &apos;s something we need to discuss .
okay .
i applied to law school .
that &apos;s amazing .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell me ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe &apos; cause i didn &apos;t think i could actually do it ,
but i did .
i got this today .
i got in .
it--it &apos;s in ... boston .
i know things have been hard between us ,
but maybe a fresh start is what we need .
maybe we &apos;ve been fighting too hard
to recapture old memories
when we should &apos;ve been making new ones instead .
who are you ?
what are you waiting for ? !
do you think i fear you ?
abigail ?
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to get my hands on you
before your father ripped you to shreds .
how did you know i was going ...
because i have ears in the king &apos;s court .
and despite everyone &apos;s best efforts to shield me from it ,
i know the truth .
you love snow white ...
and you have no intention of marrying me .
i won &apos;t marry someone i don &apos;t love
or give that despot the satisfaction that i helped him .
if that means suffering the consequences ,
so be it .
you &apos;re prepared to lay down your life .
how charming .
but i didn &apos;t come here to see you die .
i came here to help you escape .
why would you do anything to help me ?
because i don &apos;t want to marry you either .
what did you tell her ?
that i needed to take a walk , clear my head ,
think about it .
i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t tell her that the walk was with me .
no . no , of course not .
why is that our default ?
lying .
because i don &apos;t ...
we &apos;re not being honest .
i know it &apos;s hard , but ...
we have to tell her the truth about everything ,
about us .
i don &apos;t know if i can .
you have to .
if we can &apos;t be honest with other people ,
how can we be honest with each other ?
is it really the best plan ?
what &apos;s your plan ?
moving to boston ?
no .
the only way no one gets hurt here
is if we don &apos;t want to be together .
is that what you want ?
no .
well , then we have to stop hiding and do something .
it &apos;s better she hears it from you than from someone else .
you have to make a choice .
i choose ...
you .
then it &apos;s time to tell kathryn .
i &apos;ve been meaning to bump into you .
matter of fact , i was hoping
we might grab that drink you promised .
is that you asking me out ?
well , if putting a label on it makes you more comfortable , sure .
let &apos;s call it a date .
i thought you came here to write , find inspiration .
i &apos;m optimistic about our date .
see , i have a policy .
i won &apos;t go out with guys who won &apos;t tell me their names .
i find it weeds out the ones who like to keep secrets ,
like they &apos;re already married
or they store body parts in their freezer .
it was nice talking to you .
it &apos;s august .
august w. booth .
really ? with the middle initial ?
w &apos;s for wayne .
so there goes your reason for not meeting me here after work .
who was that ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
&quot; yet &quot; ? so you &apos;re going to find out ?
it &apos;s nothing .
nothing with you means something ,
because if it were nothing , we wouldn &apos;t be talking about it .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought you called me here
to talk about you .
yeah , but talking about you is easier right now .
what is it ? what &apos;s going on ?
remember when you told me to stay away from david
and i agreed ?
yes .
i didn &apos;t .
yeah , i know .
you do ? how ?
because i &apos;m sheriff ,
and you are a lovesick schoolteacher .
covering your tracks is not exactly your strong suit .
well , i &apos;ve been discreet ... discreet .
two teacups in the sink ,
new perfume , late nights , plunging necklines--
it was not hard to connect the dots .
plunging ?
when i met you , you were a top button kind of girl .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
i &apos;m not your mother .
no .
according to henry , i &apos;m yours .
i just figured that you would let me know when it was time .
i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s time .
he &apos;s telling kathryn .
everything ?
everything .
david ?
david , come take a look .
i found a whole bunch of great apartment options .
i have no idea which neighborhood to look at , but--
have you ever been to boston ?
no . no , i &apos;ve never been .
maybe we should ask the sheriff , emma .
she &apos;s from there . she could probably help--
kathryn .
i can &apos;t go to boston with you .
can &apos;t ... or won &apos;t ?
i &apos;m sorry . i am so , so sorry .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
try the truth .
david , is there something going on that i don &apos;t know about ?
no .
no , something happened .
i don &apos;t know what it is ,
but there is something that &apos;s preventing me ...
from connecting ,
and it &apos;s not fair to you to let that screw up your life .
you &apos;re right . you need a fresh start .
it &apos;s just not with me .
we &apos;ve reached my father &apos;s realm .
we should be safe here .
i have provisions waiting for you .
i can &apos;t take any of it ,
not until you tell me what &apos;s really going on .
i told you , i was just
stop playing games .
if you have no feelings for me , as you &apos;ve said ,
why show me any kindness at all ?
what haven &apos;t you told me ?
this isn &apos;t about you , james .
it &apos;s me .
i don &apos;t want to marry you
because my heart also belongs to another--
a man i was once to wed ...
a man named frederick .
what happened ?
we all have our own tragedies--
lost love being the worst .
i thought reuniting you with yours
might grant me some consolation .
well , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m not able to help you , then .
my &quot; love &quot; told me in no uncertain terms
that she does not feel for me as ...
i do for her .
you can &apos;t fight for something that doesn &apos;t exist .
so ... there is my tragedy .
that &apos;s so tragedy .
come .
follow me .
a moment , please .
this is where my beloved frederick sacrificed his life .
i &apos;m sorry .
did he die in battle ?
we were traveling with my father , king midas .
when our caravan was ambushed ,
frederick bravely defended us
and was cut down saving my father &apos;s life .
it &apos;s a fitting tribute .
the craftsmanship is-- is remarkable .
i &apos;ve never seen anything quite so lifelike .
that &apos;s because the hand you &apos;re touching is actually frederick &apos;s .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s not a statue .
frederick saw the attack when no one else did
and threw himself in front of my father ,
knocking him to safety .
because of my father &apos;s curse ,
he was instantly turned to gold .
all curses can be broken .
have you tried true love &apos;s kiss ?
until my lips bled .
the gold got in the way .
there must be something else to do .
there is legend of a lake .
lake nostos .
its waters are said to have magical properties
that can return to you something that was once lost .
and yet you haven &apos;t tried it ?
of course i have ,
but the lake is guarded by a ghastly creature
that drowns its victims .
no one who &apos;s ever faced it has lived to return .
don &apos;t give up hope just yet .
i will face this guardian
and return with the water that will undo this wretched curse .
none have succeeded .
none have my fearless bravery .
or fearless disregard for their own safety .
either way ,
one of us should have our happiness .
and if you die , neither of us will .
no , not true .
don &apos;t you understand ? if i succeed ,
you will be reunited with frederick and your misery ends .
if i fail ,
the misery that ends will be mine .
oh , go on . open it .
what &apos;s the occasion ?
the occasion is i love you .
go on .
now i know you miss your book , but with this ,
you can do the heroics .
you can save the princesses .
you can be the hero .
henry , you have to believe me .
when i tore down the playground , i did it for your safety .
please don &apos;t be upset with me .
i really didn &apos;t mean to destroy your book .
it &apos;s not just the book .
okay . then what is it ?
it &apos;s emma .
i want to see her .
regina , you got a min--
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , don &apos;t worry about it .
henry , why don &apos;t you get home and start your homework ?
i &apos;ll be there in a bit , and we can have dinner .
oh , kathryn , what is it ?
it &apos;s david .
he &apos;s leaving me .
that little homewrecker .
excuse me ?
she just couldn &apos;t stay away , could she ?
what are you talking about ?
why , mary margaret , of course .
what &apos;s mary margaret got to do with this ?
what &apos;s mary margaret got to do with any of this ?
regina , do you know something ?
they &apos;ve been having an affair .
how do you know this ?
how ? did you see something ?
i ... saw pictures .
sidney was always looking for scandal .
it sells papers . he showed me .
i buried them of course .
show me .
kathryn--
show me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i thought you two were working it out .
i wanted you to work it out .
believe me , i want you two together .
why ?
why do you care about any of this ?
because i &apos;m your friend .
no , you &apos;re not .
a friend wouldn &apos;t do this .
a friend wouldn &apos;t lie .
everyone is lying to me .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a shrine to the guardian of the lake .
every man who faces it leaves an offering here first ,
asking for the creature &apos;s mercy .
i go the rest of the way alone .
no , this is for me . you have to let me come with you .
no . the only life i want in my hands is my own .
good luck then .
and don &apos;t forget ...
a lot of good it did them .
hey . did , uh ,
did you do it ?
yeah . it &apos;s bad .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , it was , um ...
it was really bad .
but you told the truth ,
so now we can pick up the pieces .
we can start over from a real place .
hey . i wanna see you .
can i come by when you get done at school ?
of course . i &apos;ll see you then .
and , david , you did the right thing .
oh ! hey . watch where you &apos;re going .
kathryn .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry .
screw you , you &apos;re sorry .
i understand you &apos;re upset .
you have every right to be .
thank you for that insight .
can we please talk somewhere private ?
private ?
why do you get any consideration at all ?
you have shown none for me--
either of you . all you did was lie !
we should have talked to you sooner ,
but we &apos;ve been completely honest . we didn &apos;t lie .
you didn &apos;t lie ?
you snuck around .
you have him break up my marriage with a pack of lies ,
with some crap about not being able to connect ?
he didn &apos;t have any trouble connecting with you .
david didn &apos;t tell you about us ?
no . of course not .
that would have been the honorable thing to do .
but he said he would tell you .
well , then he lied to you , too .
good luck making it work .
you two deserve each other .
where are you ?
make yourself known to me .
beast !
show yourself .
here i am .
you &apos;re gonna come in ?
i thought you wanted that drink .
i do , but i didn &apos;t say here .
hop on .
you want me to get on the back of that bike ?
that &apos;s what &quot; hop on &quot; means .
how about if we go somewhere , i drive ?
how about you stop having to control everything
and take a leap of faith ?
you owe me a drink . hop on . i know a good watering hole .
if you don &apos;t , i will .
a watering hole , literally ?
well , say what you want about me .
i always tell the truth .
i just thought a drink was , like , wine or whiskey .
what , do you want me to get you drunk ?
no .
next time .
you are optimistic .
they say there &apos;s something special about this well .
there &apos;s even a legend .
they say that the water from the well
is fed by an underground lake ,
and that lake has magical properties .
magic ? you sound like henry .
smart kid .
so this legend--it says that
if you drink the water from the well ,
something lost will be returned to you .
you know an awful lot about this town for being a stranger .
and you know very little for being the sheriff .
how do you know all this ? you &apos;ve been here before ?
i know all of this for one very simple reason .
i read the plaque .
you actually believe that ?
i &apos;m a writer . i have to have an open mind .
yeah , but magic ?
water is a very powerful thing .
cultures as old as time have worshipped it .
it flows throughout all lands , connecting the entire world .
if anything had mystical properties ,
if anything had magic ,
well , i &apos;d say it &apos;d be water .
that &apos;s asking a lot to believe on faith .
if you need evidence for everything , emma ,
you &apos;re gonna find yourself stuck in one place for a long time .
maybe .
or maybe i &apos;ll just find the truth before anyone else .
well , ms. skeptic ,
there &apos;s one thing i can tell you for sure
that requires no leap of faith ,
and i know you &apos;ll agree with me .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s good water .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , gosh . i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t--
excuse me .
i must not have been looking .
oh . you .
excuse me ?
you should be ashamed of yourself .
what &apos;s your name ?
would you like to know mine ?
because i can be anyone you want me to be .
stop .
i know what you are . you &apos;re a siren .
your deceitful words are a spell meant to lure me to my death .
i would never hurt such a brave , powerful man like yourself ,
not when there are so many other things we could do .
i said stop .
i will not fall prey to your deceptions .
really ?
you &apos;re immune to me .
like me more now , charming ?
no . you &apos;re not really her .
it &apos;s an illusion .
i know it &apos;s not real .
sometimes illusions are better than truth .
everything you want
that you can &apos;t have ...
i can give it to you .
all you have to do ...
is kiss me .
i know you want to . i can feel it .
no .
no .
i don &apos;t want an illusion .
i want reality or nothing .
this doesn &apos;t feel real ?
snow ...
oh , that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s me .
i love you .
no .
no . it &apos;s not you .
yes , it is . i love you .
no . this is not real love .
i &apos;ve felt it , and this isn &apos;t it .
i know the difference .
congratulations , prince charming .
you &apos;re the first .
who did this ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know how any of this happened .
you don &apos;t know ?
really ?
mary margaret ,
i can &apos;t control what other people do .
no , but you can control what you do ,
and you lied .
and now everyone is calling me a tramp .
who told her ?
that is exactly the wrong question .
the real question is why didn &apos;t you do what we discussed ?
why didn &apos;t you tell her ?
i thought we could spare her feelings .
right . you thought .
not we . you .
and we discussed this .
i didn &apos;t want anyone to get hurt .
now everyone is hurt .
we had an understanding .
we had an agreement .
but you not only lied to her ,
you lied to me .
mary margaret , please . listen to me .
if we want to see if-- if this--
if what we have is love ...
we have to do what you said .
we have to pick up the pieces , and we gotta move on .
david , this isn &apos;t love .
what we have is something else entirely .
what we have is destructive ,
and it has to stop .
come .
what are you saying ?
that we shouldn &apos;t be together .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i had no idea you were so good with plants .
better than with people , it would seem .
what are you doing here ?
i thought after what happened yesterday ,
i &apos;d be the last person you &apos;d want to see .
so did i.
and then i thought about it ,
and i realized i owed you an apology .
kathryn , you don &apos;t ...
i know you would never do anything to hurt me .
i was just so angry
and confused , and i snapped .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve just been fighting so hard to hold on to david ,
i &apos;ve never stopped to ask myself why .
he &apos;s your husband .
you love each other . you always have .
no .
we haven &apos;t .
see the way he looks at her ?
he &apos;s never looked at me like that ,
not even before his accident .
kathryn , relationships take work .
you can &apos;t give up so easily .
have you ever been in love ?
yes .
once .
then you &apos;re lucky .
because what i &apos;m coming to understand is ...
is that i haven &apos;t .
what they have is real . it &apos;s true .
my marriage to david--
it just was like an illusion .
i don &apos;t know how it happened , but it was never real .
i know that now .
the way david looks at mary margaret ...
that &apos;s what i want for me ...
and i &apos;m gonna go out there and i &apos;m gonna find it .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m sticking to my plan . i &apos;m moving to boston ...
alone .
if i stay here , i &apos;ll never be happy .
and what about david ?
i wrote him a letter--
him and mary margaret .
i told them they should be together .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . you did what ?
i can &apos;t see him , not now .
it &apos;s just too painful .
i &apos;m gonna miss you , regina .
you &apos;ve been a good friend to me .
you &apos;re really going ?
you know , it &apos;s funny .
i &apos;ve always had this irrational fear of leaving storybrooke ,
like something just was holding me back . is that crazy ?
no .
change is always frightening .
but you know what , kathryn ?
this just may be what you need .
maybe you &apos;ll find what you &apos;re looking for .
water from lake nostos ,
as requested .
remarkable !
but how did you manage to slay the beast ?
oh , the fate of your true love was at stake ,
and it was a battle i couldn &apos;t afford to lose .
abigail , what happened to me ?
you were trapped , but now you &apos;re free .
this is james .
he &apos;s the one who freed you .
i am forever indebted to you .
well , pay me back by walking down the aisle ...
with someone you truly belong with .
and perhaps giving me a horse and supplies for a journey as well .
done .
thank you ...
so much .
where will you go ?
to find snow white .
you are going after her .
true love isn &apos;t easy ,
but it must be fought for ,
because once you find it ,
it can never be replaced .
how will you know where to find her ?
well , a bird helped me track her down once .
hopefully , it can again .
well , then good luck .
oh , and , james , please make haste .
when king george discovers
that the union of the kingdoms has been ruined ,
he will come after you .
some people will stop at nothing
to destroy the happiness of others .
wow ! i love that game .
&quot; space paranoids , &quot; right ?
yeah . my mom got it for me .
i used to play that all the time when i was a kid .
relax . it &apos;s all in the wrists .
my mom &apos;s picking me up in , like , five minutes .
all right , i &apos;ll be quick then .
i just have something i &apos;d like to give you .
you found it ! where &apos;d you get it ?
i found it in a gutter .
it must have fallen off the dump truck on the way to the junkyard
and got tossed around in the rain
and somehow made its way back to me .
wow . that &apos;s crazy .
what other explanation could there be ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , whatever happened ,
it came back to me .
maybe it means our luck is changing .
operation cobra is back on .
it &apos;s a sign .
things are gonna be better .
i hope you &apos;re right , kid .
i gotta go .
snow !
snow white !
snow !
are you there ? !
she &apos;s gone .
she never came back after she went to find you .
then i &apos;ll find her .
i will always find her .
and i will convince her that we belong together .
i will always fight for her , no matter what comes between us .
it won &apos;t be much of a fight .
what are you talking about ?
snow wants to be with you more than anything .
don &apos;t mock me .
snow told me that we can &apos;t be together
because she doesn &apos;t love me .
she left here to break up your wedding
because she &apos;s in love with you .
unless something changed her mind along the way .
not something .
someone .
james ?
who are they ?
that &apos;s someone . king george .
bring me his head !
come on !
hyah !
you feel like talking about it yet ?
nope .
you wanna be alone ?
nope .
