we want to give back .
we &apos;re going to buy every student a tablet computer
and upgrade your entire school
with the latest cloud @-@ based technology .
here &apos;s a check . take this check .
the first black president ...

come back with my fall semester !
we don &apos;t need filmstrips
like life in these 48 states anymore ,
because our school is going all digital !
ow , damn it !
the teachers union won &apos;t stand for this .
it means less work for you .
i didn &apos;t know it was possible to do less work .
how intriguing .

we can finally afford attractive teachers .
i was the only one here who understood osmosis .

willie , since all our books have been digitized ,
we have no need for the paper versions-- burn these .
wouldn &apos;t it be easier just to toss them out ?
nonsense ! we now have this state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art
digital book burner .
listen to her hum .
what &apos;s that ? !
well , we didn &apos;t want to leave you
out of the digital revolution .
willie , meet your new supervisor .
aw , i have to take orders from a machine ?
oh , it can &apos;t speak .
but should it ever learn , yes .
will there ever be a technology
that teaches stupid children
how to ding a dang triangle ? !
this school has spent the last 50 years mired in the 1960s .
let us spend the next 50 mired in now !
bo @-@ ron !
and with this ring ,
we unite these ancient warring clans ,
who frolic unclothed , even in winter ,
and bring peace to decapita !
pay cable is awesome !
who knew they had nipples in castle times ?
you &apos;re not supposed to be able to get outside our network !
you shouldn &apos;t have made your password &quot; password . &quot;
well , it was the name of the street i grew up on .
password drive !
seymour , you plugged the servers in
with surge protectors , didn &apos;t you ?
oh , yes , power strips .

surge protectors are always power strips .
but not vice versa !

春田小学电路被毁 昔日头条今日用

uh , robert e. lee .
miss hoover , are you teaching or are you just saying
anything that comes into your head ?
miss hoover , please report to the main office .
you just did that in your hand !
ralph wiggum , put your head down .
you &apos;re the mouth @-@ hand !
all right , class . we don &apos;t have computers
and we don &apos;t have keyboards .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t practice our typing .
now , put your index fingers
on marshmallows f and j , and ...
tap @-@ tap @-@ tap .
tap @-@ tap @-@ tap .
tap @-@ tap ... nelson , stop that !
this is my dinner .
i &apos;m eating steak .
needs sauce .
great news , children . i found an educational movie
i can play on my phone .
crowd in-- it &apos;s kind of a little phone .
mathematics ! agriculture !
are there two more exciting words ?
since the time of the romans , they used scythes
to kill each other .
the ancient farmer needed tools to measure his land .
ten stick knots right .
five left .
oh , come to mock ol &apos; willie , have you ?
&quot; ooh , willie has to work in the hot sun all day .
willie &apos;s best friend is a stick and a string . &quot;
i &apos;m not here to mock you .
&quot; ooh , willie doesn &apos;t know
when someone &apos;s being sincere ! &quot;
i &apos;m just here to hang out .
what &apos;s that device you &apos;re using ?
my rummlie scob . nothing exciting .
just a measuring stick dating back to the ancient druids .
oh ! could you tell me how it works ?
each knot marks the length of a sheep &apos;s bladder .
the play field is 75 stomachs by 52 kidneys .
that &apos;s 163 square haggises .
move over , metric system !
i &apos;m learning the gastric system !
clever .
uh , good news , sir , i have assembled
a page on &quot; the piglims &quot; at &quot; rhymouth pock . &quot;
yes , well , that &apos;s the best we can hope for .
uh , apply the transparent tape .
principal skin @-@ ner !
willie has showed me that losing our technology
doesn &apos;t have to be the end of our learning .
we can turn our school into a waldorf school .
you mean like the hotel ?
nope ! in elementary school ,
waldorf education focuses
on hands @-@ on activity and creative play .
in secondary education ...
ah , not our problem .
after sixth grade , it &apos;s good @-@ bye and good luck .
yes , yes , it is .
well , it sounds good , but i have one more question .
is it based on the book where you find the guy in the hat ?
where &apos;s waldo ? that &apos;s not even the name .
i &apos;m surprised you guys didn &apos;t think it was based on the salad .
there &apos;s a waldorf salad ?
behold-- waldorf education in action !
we &apos;re getting our hands dirty and learning by doing .
so i have to make 360 sloppy joes ,
but i only have one pound of hamburger meat .
how many cubic feet of styrofoam peanuts should i add ?
assuming four peanuts per joe ,
37 cubic feet .
well , you &apos;re a smart little fatso .
it says here that students don &apos;t have to raise their hands .
they should just ask every question
that comes to their mind .
oh . why are pine needles pointy ?
and , um @-@ um @-@ um , what &apos;s the difference
between an asteroid and a meteor ?
and , mm ... ooh @-@ ooh !
can you shrug anything other than your shoulders ?
does anyone else have any questions ?
um , if mommy &apos;s purse didn &apos;t belong in the microwave ,
why did it fit ?
we won &apos;t need computers , we won &apos;t need books .
i learned not to drink out of the crick .
you mean this isn &apos;t crick water ?
my daddy raised me
and all my 11 dead siblings on crick water !
huh , everyone wears a hat .
sun hats in the summer , wool hats in the winter .
ooh , look at this .
weekly friday night parents &apos; meetings .
oh ... wait .
there might be a safety hatch .
does the apostrophe come before
or after the &quot; s &quot; on &quot; parents &quot; ?
after , which means both parents .
well , i &apos;m not wearing a hat .
people might think i &apos;m bald .
before we share announcements
and see the results of grade three &apos;s
dance study of willows and drooping trees ,
we greet the day with a school song .
now i have to sing a song ? !
why did those idiots mix up
power strips and surge protectors ?
* every single living creature *
* every cat and every flea *
* all things with a facial feature *
* have the right to smile at me *
* every family is a unit *
* sometimes yelling , sometimes mad *
* divorced or gay or even foster *
* even billy with three dads *
i feel like beethoven
when charles grodin finally accepted him as his dog .
this school is so great now .
kids learn by doing .
if it &apos;s so great , why aren &apos;t you helping
your kids do their homework ?
bart &apos;s here doing it right now .
no , no , no ! not two @-@ thirds , one @-@ half !
now that &apos;s one @-@ third each .
now you &apos;re learning !
enjoy .
one earthworm ... gah !
two halves .
willie ! willie !
they want you to coach our school math team !
i &apos;ll have to check with my supervisor .
good to go !
so , if willie gets paid three cents per square foot
for seeding , and if the field
is 2,500 square feet ,
what is willie getting ?
i &apos;d say &quot; screwed . &quot;
you &apos;re right !
you ! chalmers !
come back here , you willie @-@ chiseling cheat !
hey , who threw that egg
at a most efficient 45 @-@ degree angle ?
it was me , sir .
kids , meet your new math team captain .
it &apos;s about time .
but i &apos;m the captain .
not anymore .
i can &apos;t see .
i can &apos;t see .
welcome to the long @-@ anticipated rematch
between waverly hills and springfield .
um , can you tell me which college i should go to ?
it &apos;s not a sorting hat !
please ! early applications are due next week !
all right .
uh , miami of ohio .
okay .
our first question is a toss @-@ up .
&quot; what is the least common multiple
of six , eight and 16 ? &quot;
48 !
is correct !
whoa ! no one said there &apos;d be math !
we said there &apos;d be nothing but math !
and you &apos;re the math team captain !
i thought i wouldn &apos;t have to do anything .
you know , like an italian cruise ship captain .
you &apos;re lucky that captain &apos;s not here
right now to answer your insult !
he &apos;d crash a ship right into your house !
* oh , he love , he love , he love *
* he does love his numbers *
* and they run , they run *
* they run him in a great big circle *
* in a circle of infinity *
espn isn &apos;t covering this .
* point one , four one , five , nine *
* two , six , five , three , five *
* eight , nine , seven , nine three , two . *
and so , with the score knotted at 29 @-@ all ,
it comes down to one last question .
drawing three straight lines ,
construct nine non @-@ overlapping--
that &apos;s non @-@ overlapping , not overlapping ,
but non @-@ overlapping-- triangles .
i have the answer !
as someone whose dad &apos;s hair is
made of ms , it &apos;s child &apos;s play .
oh , not this again .
whoo @-@ hoo ! i &apos;m a solution !
the action fractions win !
you guys might be richer and better looking ,
but we won a contest to even the series !
mm , that &apos;ll look great in our trophy case .
willie , build a trophy case .
aye , sir .
but you know what we should really thank for our success ?
lower standards !
lower standards !
you &apos;re wonderful , willie .
you and the ancient scottish scientist
that invented the rummlie scob .
well , the truth is , it wasn &apos;t invented for science .
really ?
then what for ?
oh , it was used for hanging sheep stealers !
the wee knots kept them alive longer
to make the punishment more cruel .
maybe i don &apos;t want to know these things .
can you say something nice about scotland ?
well , sometimes the fog comes in
and covers everything terrible .
very atmospheric .
