mr. grayson here made some kind of deal with the court .
helping you would be beneficial towards restoring
his public profile .
daniel &apos;s adding a new feather in the company cap .
stonehaven united .
nolan ross is hiding the carrion program .
we &apos;re counting on you .
helen crowley made contact with me ,
told me that my sister &apos;s still alive .
and we need to draw her out .
who were those guys ?
i have my suspicions .
brava .
now let &apos;s see if she buys it .
every human is born of collusion .
we come into this world the result of a covenant .
sometimes made of love ...
sometimes of circumstance ...
but almost always made in secret .
i have to assume
that you &apos;re reading that rag at that decibel
for my benefit .
what in this house isn &apos;t for your benefit , dear ?
though i did catch wind of some news
that i &apos;m sure will interest you .
jason prosser is vying for stonehaven united .
now that &apos;s a lead from the initiative
you were once in sole possession of .
well , what are you implying , conrad ?
that you &apos;re trying to subvert the deal
to prove daniel &apos;s incompetency to helen .
don &apos;t get me wrong . i approve of the plan .
just not with your visibility .
i &apos;ve had my communications director
assemble a montauk dossier .
as i go forward with my plans to clean up the docks ,
i expect you by my side
as the wife you &apos;ve recommitted to be .
so you &apos;re still using amanda clarke &apos;s hardships
to feed your delusions
of one day occupying the governor &apos;s mansion ?
morning , all .
darling , happy birthday .
thanks , daddy .
just don &apos;t spend it all in ten places .
sweetheart . oh .
is it possible that i have a 24 and 18 @-@ year @-@ old ?
where does time go ?
and where is daniel ?
oh , believe it or not , he &apos;s already in the office .
so driven that apparently
he forgot his little sister &apos;s big day .
good morning .
oh , good morning .
charlotte , would you excuse us for a minute ?
it seems that the cat has dragged itself back in .
there &apos;s the report you requested .
thank you .
so this is the new communications director ?
don &apos;t you know that politicians
tend to keep their concubines in the closet ?
spoken like a woman that no one is sleeping with .
you &apos;ll be happy to hear that ms. davenport and i
have put our past behind us ,
and we are now looking to the future .
well , i can only imagine what kind of horrifying footage
that will yield .
you look like the loneliest man in the world .
first i &apos;m banned from grayson global ,
now your house .
how long till our scheming
gets me banned from the hamptons entirely ?
that &apos;s why i called .
i needed an honest moment .
i miss you .
me , too .
as most of the time i &apos;m with you ,
i &apos;m resigned to playing the jealous ex .
well , you played it perfectly last night .
thank you .
how are you doing with it ?
as well as a woman leading on her ex @-@ fiance
can possibly feel about herself .
he &apos;s taking me to lunch , to a new oyster bar .
oysters . subtle .
hey , well , at least our ... mission is on track .
aiden , i know how hard it must be ,
waiting for a lead on your sister ,
but until they give you proof that she &apos;s alive--
i can subsist on hope ,
which is more than i &apos;ve had for the past decade .
so what &apos;s your next move ?
unfortunately , it &apos;s not mine . it &apos;s helen &apos;s .
she &apos;s holding all the cards .
whatever happens ,
we &apos;re gonna figure it out , okay ?
i promise .
i know what you &apos;re up to .
you had the seller stage this place
with all my favorite decor , didn &apos;t you ?
anything to end your never @-@ ending house hunt .
you &apos;ve hated all the other places
for the most nitpicky reasons .
well , we &apos;ve only looked at ... 12 .
at an average of 20,000 @-@ square @-@ foot per ,
which adds up to--
a marathon .
i see your point ,
and i think ...
i do love this house .
great ! i &apos;ll call the agent .
and this can be yours tomorrow .
okay . what &apos;s wrong now ?
well , the key-- it &apos;s a little ... pedestrian .
okay , &apos; kay , &apos; kay . well , nothing &apos;s ... perfect .
except ... maybe you .
i thought we were going for lunch .
we are .
you love kumamotos , right ?
well , they &apos;re only fresh on the west coast ,
and since the oysters can &apos;t come to us ...
no , i know what you &apos;re gonna say--
we gotta take this slow .
but stonehaven wants face time with everyone in the running ,
and i &apos;m at my best with you by my side .
daniel ...
i can &apos;t just pick up and leave .
i didn &apos;t even bring anything with me .
don &apos;t worry . i packed you a bag .
i even bought you a couple of new outfits for los angeles .
it &apos;s all on board .
listen , em ...
you helped me land takeda industries and nolcorp .
but this is my first real play as c.e.o.
help me make it a trifecta .
please .
great .
now i promise , this is a business trip .
all right ? we can take it as slow as you like .
unless ...
easy , tiger . let &apos;s get stonehaven first .
then we &apos;ll decide how to celebrate .
you could &apos;ve just called .
that &apos;s so impersonal after all we &apos;ve been through .
and besides , it &apos;s in my best interest
to keep the ball in my court .
i have my suspicions you were behind
that little stunt at the wine auction .
oh , you flatter me .
if you recall , they gassed us both .
a perfect cover for your partner
to run the interrogation .
you and victoria grayson have much to gain
by working together--
you to save your sister , she to save her son .
i assure you , i had no part to play in our abduction ,
nor would i ever collude with that woman .
i work alone .
and until i see proof of my sister &apos;s well @-@ being ,
that &apos;s how it &apos;s going to stay .
what &apos;s your name again , darlin &apos; ?
colleen .
that right ? you got a family somewhere ?
i have a brother .
what do i have to do ?
kill victoria grayson .
you have 24 hours .
第二季 第十二集
not only do i appreciate your plight ,
it may surprise you , mr. porter ,
but we have a considerable amount in common .
we &apos;re both entrepreneurs ,
both in complicated relationships .
we took over our father &apos;s businesses ,
and we inherited their sins .
clearing the drug charge won &apos;t be a problem for my lawyers ,
but murder ...
jack didn &apos;t kill anybody .
we know , but we also know
that the gun used to kill joe ryan
was registered to his father .
i thought that &apos;s why we were here ,
so you could help us with that .
or is it the other way around ?
are we just the poster children for your new public image ?
oh , you mean do i have a selfish motivation for this ?
you bet .
see , my daughter chooses to spend her leisure time
in your questionable establishment ,
putting herself in harm &apos;s way .
it &apos;s a concern i &apos;m sure you share for your son carl ,
a child proudly named after the man
whose legacy you &apos;re willing to go to jail to uphold .
the shooter &apos;s name is matt duncan .
the ryan brothers put him in the hospital
trying to get him to talk , but he wouldn &apos;t break .
i &apos;ll get the authorities on the line .
no , look , without matt duncan ,
my dad would &apos;ve lost the stowaway six years ago .
he protected us then . i &apos;m standing by him now .
oh , i can see we &apos;re both stubborn , too .
but unlike you , mr. porter , i value self @-@ preservation
and the living .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m unable to help you
if you &apos;re unwilling to help yourself .
feel free to show yourselves out .
i knew this was a mistake .
the only mistake being made here is yours .
father &apos;s friend or not , matt duncan is a murderer .
if you don &apos;t call him out , carl loses his dad ,
and i lose my husband ...
assuming i even get to call you that
before they lock you up .
after the northridge quake ,
my father was inspired to use the profits
from our military contracts
to create a privatized disaster @-@ relief firm .
stonehaven and its employees meant everything to my father .
and i &apos;m not interested in handing it over to someone
with plans to break it up and sell it for parts .
believe me , that &apos;s not my intention at all .
forgive me , but your company &apos;s rather dubious reputation
doesn &apos;t offer much comfort .
well , i think we can all agree
that grayson global needs its own kind of disaster relief .
why don &apos;t you mention what we were talking about earlier ?
right .
my goal is to re @-@ brand our image
so that the &quot; global &quot; refers to world view ,
not world domination .
thank you for your candor .
and i can tell you
that your bid is on top of a very short list
of competing offers .
well , thank you very much for this opportunity ,
ms. carlisle . it &apos;s been a pleasure .
lovely to meet you .
you , too .
you see ?
if it weren &apos;t for you , i may have lost her just now .
thanks for the assist .
well , we haven &apos;t won yet .
but it &apos;s looking up .
should we head to the hotel ?
yes .
the pieces of the puzzle
are beginning to come together , ms. lahari .
all but yours .
i &apos;m doing everything i can .
remember what &apos;s at stake for you
if you don &apos;t find the carrion program .
not a moment goes by that i don &apos;t .
you &apos;re one of many irons i have in the fire .
don &apos;t give me a reason to pull you out .
looking for ...
something ?
damn .
i was trying to hide this so you &apos;d find it later .
i can &apos;t do anything about the pedestrian key ,
but i can change what you keep it on .
his name is hanuman .
he &apos;s an avatar of shiva
and a deity that wins against demons and bad spirits .
he &apos;ll keep you safe in your new home .
you stopped listening at &quot; avatar , &quot; didn &apos;t you ?
i heard every word you said .
thank you ...
for always looking out for me .
happy 18th , charlotte .
from your nephew .
aw . it &apos;s carl &apos;s little handprint .
it &apos;s so sweet .
18 is a big one .
you &apos;re independent , free .
in my case , i literally was ,
since that was the year i was released from juvie .
it was also the year our dad died .
yeah ...
it was .
i wish i had known you then .
i can &apos;t imagine what it was like
to lose the only family you had .
thanks .
speaking of ...
where &apos;s yours ?
daniel forgot .
my father is hopefully getting
the ryan brothers out of your hair ,
and i &apos;m meeting my mom in the city tonight
for the ballet .
it &apos;s kind of a tradition .
speak of the devil .
so what &apos;s the program tonight ? i pray it &apos;s balanchine .
well , that &apos;s just it , charlotte .
everything &apos;s okay , but i had to leave town suddenly ,
and i won &apos;t be back until tomorrow .
but i promise to make it up to you .
are you serious ?
you do know that i love you , don &apos;t you ?
yes .
good . then keep that close to your heart
till i get back tomorrow .
okay , thanks .
i &apos;ll take care of that , mr. prosser .
what does it mean
when your mom cancels your birthday ?
i &apos;d say it &apos;s her gift to you .
i guess being a grayson
just means learning to live with disappointment .
you &apos;re not a grayson .
not really .
victoria ?
i &apos;ll get right on it .
jason .
i am peeved with you .
it seems that you &apos;ve thrown your hat
into the stonehaven ring .
simply my compulsion to leave no stone unturned .
well , then as a major shareholder of grayson global ,
let me disabuse you of your pessimistic outlook .
aren &apos;t you still my competition ?
business makes for strange bedfellows .
my son , though well @-@ intentioned ,
is not ready for this acquisition .
so i &apos;m here to protect the family business .
there &apos;s something you &apos;re not telling me .
only that you would make an excellent steward
for stonehaven .
and should that come to pass ,
i hope you &apos;ll allow me to thank you later .
as for now , i have a meeting to get to .
oh , you &apos;re not serious .
i can &apos;t believe you . you crossed the country
to lure that rat into helping you .
i just bumped into him .
oh . i &apos;m here for you , daniel .
although i see that you brought reinforcements .
yeah , it &apos;s nice to have someone &apos;s unconditional support .
well , then allow me to offer you mine .
now if your intention is to rehabilitate grayson global &apos;s image ,
i would encourage you to not go through with this acquisition .
why , because i &apos;ll affirm my standing as c. e. o. ?
no , quite the opposite .
these disaster @-@ relief companies swim in dirty pools ,
and stonehaven is no exception .
they &apos;re not humanitarians . they are profiteers .
are you really trying to take the moral high ground ?
have you forgotten what you are ,
what you &apos;ve profited from ?
i suggest you that you do your research
and find out why these people want ...
do my research ?
you want me to do my research ?
you should probably go upstairs
before you say something you regret in public .
think about it .
yeah .
i assume , per our agreement , you &apos;re here to dissuade my son
from going through with this acquisition ?
you need to explain to me exactly why
you are so set against it .
did you not understand a word i said ?
this is not in daniel &apos;s best interest .
and unlike my son , prosser can hold his own .
now he &apos;s sitting on the fence ,
and i &apos;m here to push him in the right direction .
there you are .
aiden , listen , i don &apos;t have a lot of time to explain ,
but daniel decided to sweep me off to l . a.
to help him get stonehaven .
and i &apos;m sure he thinks you &apos;ll seal the deal
in that blue dress you &apos;re wearing .
behind you .
what the hell are you doing in l . a. ?
funny , i thought the same thing
when i saw you in the lobby with daniel .
you &apos;re saying you didn &apos;t follow us ?
while i &apos;m not thrilled your lunch date
turned into a change of time zones ,
i do trust you , emily .
then what are you doing here ?
helen found me .
our little ruse at the auction worked .
she believes victoria &apos;s behind everything .
now she wants proof of her meddling with the initiative &apos;s plans .
how can i help ?
go back to new york .
if they believe you &apos;re in league with victoria ,
it could have dire consequences .
i can &apos;t leave , aiden .
if daniel loses stonehaven ,
we lose our link to the initiative .
well , then our missions are at odds .
maybe not .
prosser knows that i &apos;m with daniel ,
so i can &apos;t dissuade him , but maybe you can .
to what end ?
making stonehaven a sure thing for daniel
forces victoria to expose her true intent .
and if i &apos;m successful , you &apos;ll go ?
i &apos;ll have no reason to stay .
they release you ?
oh , hey . no , uh ... insurance ran out ,
so i figure i &apos;d give my girls a chance to take care of the old man .
how you doing , jack ?
not so good .
the ryans framed me with a drug charge .
i was arrested , and the police found a gun on my boat .
and since it &apos;s a murder weapon--
i told you to stay away from them .
you--you should &apos;ve listened .
that &apos;s not gonna change the past , matt .
they &apos;re gonna pin joe ryan &apos;s murder on me .
do you understand that ? the one that you &apos;re guilty of .
and you want me to confess ?
i know this still weighs on your conscience ,
or you wouldn &apos;t have told me you did it .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to have someone hurt your child .
and , yeah , it weighs on me . but i learned to live with it .
wish i could say the same for my dad .
you heard about what happened , right ?
heart attack at 52 .
my kid never got a chance to meet him .
you want him growing up without a father , too ?
another copy of my room key , please .
okay .
always the sign of a good visit .
now you already know this ,
but that &quot; forbes &quot; cover did you no favors .
airbrushes are for super models .
last thing i need is for people believing i &apos;ve gone soft .
the man who shorted the subprime collapse ? no chance .
so , uh , what brings you to l . a. ?
you know who i am . what do you think ?
that you &apos;re here for stonehaven .
my boss has a significant interest in grayson global .
he sent me to monitor negotiations .
right . satoshi takeda .
i recognize you from the wine auction .
i @-@ i @-@ i did read the &quot; forbes &quot; piece
about your passion to
acquire businesses that are good for the soul .
is--is that for real ?
it &apos;s my new philosophy , yes .
well , then there &apos;s something you need to know .
a friend at the d. o. j. informed me
that donna carlisle is looking to dump her father &apos;s company
in advance of an indictment ,
and the lucky winner inherits the lawsuit .
why are you telling me this ?
professional respect ...
and for my soul .
but look on the bright side .
more time to spend with whoever &apos;s getting that key .
give me a dial on carlisle . it &apos;s jason prosser .
i &apos;ll have your oldest scotch .
neat .
you have my father &apos;s tastes .
and your father would &apos;ve been joe ryan , correct ?
yeah , his name came up when i was at the montauk p . d. ,
helping to clear your partner &apos;s bogus drug charges .
hey , does the name matthew duncan ring a bell ?
in this envelope is mr . duncan &apos;s confession
to your father &apos;s murder .
i &apos;m gonna make this ... very easy for you .
there &apos;s $ 50,000 for your signature
and a swift departure .
oh , come on . haven &apos;t you put these boys through enough ?
victoria .
i wanted to find out how the meeting went .
and i see i have my answer .
were you planning on leaving without saying good @-@ bye ?
it seemed consistent with your aversion to open communication .
some guy in the lobby told me about stonehaven &apos;s pending lawsuit .
well , then you were lied to .
over and over , it seems ,
starting with the moment you began priming me
for this sour deal in the first place .
i &apos;m no one &apos;s rube , victoria .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;ve always had a strength and clarity of purpose
that i admired from the first day we met .
and i remember the night ...
conrad parading you around that party
at the governor &apos;s mansion like he owned you .
but you &apos;re no one &apos;s possession , are you ?
no .
least of all conrad &apos;s .
the next morning , the david clarke scandal broke .
that &apos;s right .
david made himself vulnerable to the wrong people .
the same people who are about to take hold of my son .
unless ?
unless you win stonehaven .
jason , please . i beg of you .
i don &apos;t want stonehaven . what i want is you .
but you &apos;ve known that all along .
do what i ask ...
and i &apos;m yours .
i &apos;m so glad prosser bowed out .
finally gives us a chance to relax .
well , we always did make a good team .
and this time i promise to appreciate it .
i don &apos;t want to lose you again .
daniel , please ...
no , no , whatever it was , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not that guy anymore .
i &apos;m just happy that you &apos;re giving me a chance to prove it to you .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
oh , it &apos;s a present for charlotte .
for her birthday ?
oh , my god . i completely forgot .
well , it can be from both of us .
to teamwork .
teamwork .
hey , donna . come to a decision yet ?
right .
no , no . yeah . no . i understand .
yeah , best to be cautious .
no , we &apos;ll see you at 8 : 00 . all right .
prosser &apos;s back in the game .
what ?
i &apos;m sure my mother did whatever she could
to keep him wrapped around her talon .
carlisle wants to hear final pitches side by side tonight ,
only i &apos;ve already said my piece .
about stonehaven .
but not about your competition .
hey , big honcho . or is it head cheese ?
listen , nolan , i need a favor .
i &apos;m in l. a. and under a time crunch .
you think you could do a little digging for me on jason prosser ?
sure . uh , question is , why would i ?
because you &apos;re my employee .
and your friend ms . thorne suggested you ...
might be able to access the inaccessible .
did she now ?
i &apos;ll get right on it .
thank you .
please stay on the line .
your call is very important to us .
you sold our stake in the bar ? what the hell were you thinking ?
that it &apos;s time to put this to bed .
matt duncan confessed . that &apos;s what we wanted .
that &apos;s not what dad wanted , ken .
he made plans for us , which the porters
and the rest of these bottom @-@ feeders on these docks cut short .
trying to turn these docks into anything
more than what they already are is a waste of time ,
especially now that they &apos;ve got conrad grayson on their side .
conrad grayson is a businessman .
and i &apos;m gonna convince him to sell the stowaway back to us .
i &apos;m gonna make dad proud , okay ?
with or without your help .
and simply put , my goal is for stonehaven
to continue on the same path ideologically .
that is exactly my hope .
personally , i admire your mission to protect your father &apos;s legacy .
my dad was a good man , and not just to his own kids ,
to any child , especially disaster victims .
he &apos;d see their faces and how terrified and innocent they were--
i was living in bushwick during the blackout of &apos; 77 .
i thought the world was ending .
my father &apos;s camera store was looted ,
burned to the ground .
really ?
you know , my father helped to rehabilitate that whole borough .
you were probably one of the kids who inspired him .
well , then i have a personal obligation to repay him .
i &apos;d like to raise my offer if you &apos;ll consider it .
well , as moving as your story about the blackout is ,
ms. carlisle wishes to uphold her father &apos;s mantle ,
not destroy it .
perhaps you &apos;d like to explain to her how you colluded
to inflate gas and oil prices after 9 / 11 ?
i was never involved in those transactions .
but your subsidiaries were .
in my short time as c. e. o.
i &apos;ve learned i &apos;m not only accountable for my own actions ,
but for those of everyone working under me .
why is none of this public record ?
well , because the lawsuits were all settled and buried .
that &apos;s a fine allegation coming from a grayson .
oh , don &apos;t confuse my record with my father &apos;s . all right ?
listen , donna , i never knew your father , but i assume
he &apos;d be greatly disappointed if one of the children he helped
now helps to destroy what he created .
yes , he would be ...
as am i.
i &apos;ll have my lawyers draw up the contract ,
and we &apos;ll go from there .
i &apos;ll leave you two to talk details .
excuse me .
hello .
uh , as requested , i hacked aiden &apos;s phone .
i &apos;m sending you the file he just received
from helen crowley .
ems , they &apos;ve got his sister .
so , uh , where are you from , colleen ?
you ask too many questions .
our time &apos;s almost up .
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s , uh , kick things up a notch .
try it . you &apos;ll like it .
like you said , time &apos;s running out .
why the hell wouldn &apos;t aiden tell me about this ?
well , perhaps it has something to do with the subject line--
&quot; a life for a life &quot; ?
we know he &apos;s trying to save his sister , but ...
who &apos;s the target ?
victoria .
track his phone before it &apos;s too late .
jason .
you and your son make an admirable team .
you set me up ,
and he and that woman on his arm knock me down .
what are you talking about ? what happened ?
exactly what you knew would happen .
another grayson victory .
jason , my son is in grave danger .
i swear that i have--
whatever trouble he &apos;s in , he deserves it .
and you &apos;ve earned whatever heartbreak it brings .
what are you ...
aiden !
damn it !
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
and if i had ? i know victoria belongs to you .
i saw the video . i had nolan hack into your phone .
is it really her ?
i &apos;m certain of it .
look , i know what they &apos;re promising you ,
but you can &apos;t let them turn you into their assassin .
if i don &apos;t , then i &apos;ve failed her for the second time .
and if you do , then you give them all the power .
listen to me , right now daniel &apos;s victory is their main concern ,
and they have that . you kill his mother ,
you distract him from their main purpose .
tell helen that you realized this , and instead ,
you helped seal daniel &apos;s victory over prosser .
okay ?
look , i &apos;m going back tonight .
you should , too .
we &apos;re gonna find your sister .
but on our own terms , not theirs .
and when we do , we are gonna make them pay
for every second they kept you apart .
do you understand that ?
home again . home again .
yeah , we don &apos;t have to be , you know ?
i mean , we can refuel the jet ,
head to the bahamas , the azores--
anywhere without business or my mother .
i think i just want my own bed .
but , you know , maybe we can plan another trip sometime soon .
just got your e @-@ mail . bidding on the house ?
did you know that there was a secret passage ?
because i am totally hosting a murder @-@ mystery dinner .
that &apos;s what finally got you to commit ,
a secret passage ?
mm , and , uh ...
someone to walk through it with ?
i don &apos;t know , nolan .
after everything with marco--
hey , my feelings for groucho snarx
were fleeting and ...
and a mistake .
i mean , he was only after one thing ,
and it wasn &apos;t me .
just ...
some dusty old computer program .
you mean carrion ?
right .
victoria .
how was your flight back ?
you know , you and i could stand here all day
trading barbs and nettling each other &apos;s last nerves ,
or we can cut the crap .
why did you accompany my son to california ?
because he asked me to .
and i thought i could sway him .
yes , but in which direction ?
i was forced to walk a fine line
between my allegiance to you
and my relationship with daniel .
surely you could understand ,
seeing as you &apos;ve just done the same with prosser .
well , the difference is
that my son floats through life on crests of women ,
unable to make his own decisions .
you could &apos;ve dissuaded him at any point . why didn &apos;t you ?
i guess i wanted to see him win .
you selfish little girl .
in doing so , you may have caused him his greatest loss .
nolan ?
welcome back .
i read about how the west was won .
讲述美国一家族四代的拓荒历史
i hope i helped the cause with your faux beau .
i think i &apos;m gaining his confidence back .
but i might be losing victoria &apos;s .
it &apos;s only a matter of time
before she poisons me to daniel .
well , not if you poison her first ,
which is a far more fitting end than a bullet ,
don &apos;t you think ? speaking of which ,
have you heard from thomas crown ?
well , i &apos;ve tried triangulating his phone .
he &apos;s either jammed it or dumped it .
i just hope i made the right decision .
i know i didn &apos;t .
with the house ?
isn &apos;t this the one that i &apos;m buying you ?
i don &apos;t think so .
it seems nothing
can save me from evil spirits .
11 years ago ,
i started working on something .
have i told you what carrion is ?
rotting meat ?
mm , in the form of a million lines
of binary brilliance that ...
have the ability to knock manhattan off the power grid
in less than a millisecond .
that &apos;s what marco was looking for .
right program ,
wrong c.f.o.
last week , padma referred to carrion as a person .
and today she called it a program .
i never told her that .
i &apos;m sorry , nolan .
did she get her hands on it ?
no .
and even if she had , it &apos;s unfinished .
i keep the final sequence locked up in here .
the timing can &apos;t be a coincidence .
padma played an instrumental role
in acquiring nolcorp while seeking out carrion ,
and now daniel &apos;s latest purchase is a disaster recovery firm ?
wait , wait , wait , wait .
that &apos;s the initiative &apos;s master plan ,
turning out the lights ?
what concerns me is what happens when they do .
what &apos;s your plan for padma ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
my advice ?
play her like she &apos;s playing you .
dad ?
mom ?
bon anniversaire , ma belle .
i thought you canceled my birthday .
never .
we rescheduled it .
we &apos;re celebrating you , sweetheart ,
not the gregorian calendar .
go on . blow out the candles .
i only have one wish this year .
anything .
i have spent the last two days
thinking about family
and what it means to be a daughter ,
a sister , and now an adult .
and my only wish
is that you support my first adult decision .
i &apos;m changing my name .
i filed papers at the courthouse today .
you can now call me charlotte clarke .
happy birthday , charlotte .
from me and daniel .
emily .
well , i didn &apos;t realize we &apos;d extended invitations .
emily doesn &apos;t need one .
let &apos;s get you a drink . love you , sis .
i hope i didn &apos;t interrupt your time with your family .
trust me , i didn &apos;t want to be around
for the aftermath of charlotte &apos;s announcement .
i can &apos;t imagine what hell
my dad &apos;s giving her right now .
is everything all right ?
oh , i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry . i need to be honest with you .
a few weeks ago ,
victoria asked me to rekindle our relationship .
she wanted somebody to keep an eye on you
during your transition at work .
i said yes .
so you &apos;re the one who leaked stonehaven to her .
which is why i fought so hard to help you win it back .
believe it or not ,
i thought i was doing it for the right reasons .
you must think i &apos;m an idiot .
there isn &apos;t a single aspect of my life
that my mother hasn &apos;t meddled in .
you knew ?
i mean , i @-@ i strongly suspected .
her plans so rarely break in my favor ,
i guess i just stuck my head in the sand .
in all fairness , i guess i was using you
as much as you were me .
i was curious to see how far you were willing to go .
well , now you know .
you think we &apos;ll ever get back
to being the people we once were ?
maybe .
just not tonight .
hey , can you just tell me what you said to matt ?
honestly , not much .
he must have had a crisis of conscience .
you did the right thing , jack .
daddy saved us .
i &apos;m just glad conrad stood by his word .
he got the drug charges dropped
and banished the ryans .
oh , yeah , because now we &apos;re business partners
with conrad grayson .
i know . it &apos;s not ideal .
ideal ? the guy was stealing money from his daughter
while she was locked up in rehab .
enough , declan .
i &apos;m instating a ban on all complaining ,
frowning , and negative attitude .
it &apos;s not good for any of us .
i didn &apos;t sign off on this deal .
ink &apos;s already dry .
you &apos;re gonna have to take that up with your brother , kenneth .
i &apos;ll buy it back .
$ 60,000 .
$ 65,000 .
let me save you this embarrassing display .
exclusive of your 6 @-@ year vendetta
against the wrong man ,
i know why you think you want the stowaway .
i have been approached by investors for decades
with plans to develop the docks ,
and each one has resulted in the same conclusion--
the owners have very deep roots ,
and they aren &apos;t going anywhere .
you live in the castle above the village .
you don &apos;t know what i know ,
what my father knew , how these people work .
he almost had the waterfront in the palm of his hand .
all we need is the stowaway , and we can regain
that foothold that he once had .
by what , changing community opinion
with town hall meetings ?
nah . with muscle .
applying the proper amount of pressure ,
i can have roulette wheels spinning by memorial day .
overly arrogant and ambitious .
i like that .
think about it .
think about all those jobs you &apos;ll be creating .
it &apos;s right in line with your new public image .
conrad , we should talk about this .
you &apos;re right .
we absolutely should talk about this .
ashley , could you please close the door ?
you don &apos;t always have to pay for dinner , you know .
well , chivalry isn &apos;t dead .
it &apos;s just somewhere in my office .
you said it &apos;s your platinum card ?
it &apos;s probably
next to my computer somewhere .
i forgot to warn you about that trick drawer .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll clean it up .
i still don &apos;t see your platinum card .
it &apos;ll turn up .
i guess it is your turn to pay .
deal .
aiden , what happened ?
the graysons could see you--
i don &apos;t care .
it &apos;s done .
they made it look like an overdose .
aiden ...
aiden , i &apos;m so sorry .
but you can &apos;t trust these people .
you can &apos;t trust this .
listen to me--
listen to you ?
i did listen to you ,
and that &apos;s exactly how this happened .
you made me believe that they were manipulating me ,
giving me false hope ,
when it &apos;s you i shouldn &apos;t have trusted .
if there &apos;s a chance that my sister &apos;s alive ,
then i &apos;m gonna find her .
aiden-- and if she is dead ...
then this is on you .
aiden .
aiden !
