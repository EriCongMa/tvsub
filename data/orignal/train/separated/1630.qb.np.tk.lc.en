hang on , dr. c.
what &apos;s vexillology ?
vexillology is the study of flags .
cool .
i think i just learned something .
did you have fun doing it ?
i &apos;ll say .
fun and information are two sides to this video podcast ,
not unlike the only two @-@ sided state flag--
oregon .
oh , look .
hello , mr. beaver .
故有海狸州的别称
in future episodes , we &apos;ll answer some burning questions :
what &apos;s the only non @-@ rectangular flag ?
what animal appears most often on flags ?
what animal appears second most often on flags ?
and more .
sweet !
why are you waving a white flag ?
i &apos;m surrendering ...
to fun .
now , today &apos;s episode of fun with flags is not fun ,
but it is important .
&quot; flags : you gotta know how to hold &apos; em ,
you gotta know how to fold &apos; em . &quot;
let &apos;s start by identifying the parts of our flag .
this edge is the hoist , and it &apos;s used to ...
excuse me , sorry , excuse me .
cut .
did you not see we are rolling ?
sorry . i &apos;m having dinner with penny .
i have to get out of here .
and i have flag knowledge
that i have to get out of here !
you okay ?
no , i &apos;m a little rattled .
but like the flag over fort sumter , i &apos;m still here .
and ... take two .
hello .
i &apos;m dr. sheldon cooper ,
and welcome to the premiere episode
of sheldon cooper presents : fun with flags .
over the next 52 weeks , you and i are going to explore
the dynamic world of vexillology .
hang on , dr. cooper .
what &apos;s vexillology ?
vexillology is ...
why is there a face on that flag ?
it &apos;s ferdinand t. flag .
i thought he might help bring in some younger viewers .
confound it ! you &apos;re right , it &apos;s brilliant .
let &apos;s take it from the top .
that was a really nice dinner .
i &apos;m glad you asked me out again .
me , too ; i missed you .
you see me all the time .
you sure you just don &apos;t miss the sex ?
well , yeah , sex with you is pretty great .
have you ever tried it ?
i have . you are not wrong .
i just think if we &apos;re gonna try dating again ,
we should take things slow .
oh , i can take it slow .
did i ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school ,
karen berberick ?
to this day she doesn &apos;t know we were going out .
made it easier on her when i broke things off .
okay , well , maybe not that slow .
how about this ,
are you familiar with the typical development for computer software ?
you know , just for fun , let &apos;s say i &apos;m not .
before an application is released ,
they give it a trial run .
w @-@ we could do that .
and if we hit a rough spot , instead of getting mad ,
just say , &quot; hey , we found a bug , &quot;
and we report it so it can be fixed .
you mean like a beta test ?
well , technically , this would be an alpha test .
a beta test requires people that weren &apos;t involved
in the development of the appli ...
seriously , do i not get credit for knowing beta test ?
no , you should .
absolutely . that was me being pedantic .
that &apos;s our first bug .
you reported it .
i can fix that .
see ? this is good .
all right . let &apos;s give it a shot .
great . you keep a list , i &apos;ll keep a list .
at some point , we &apos;ll exchange .
okay .
good night , leonard .
night .
attaboy , hofstadter .
nothing gets the ladies hotter
than software development analogies .
hey , i &apos;m back .
cut .
take 47 .
here &apos;s an interesting fact about flags .
i will take that action .
the flags of liechtenstein and haiti
were identical by coincidence ,
a fact that wasn &apos;t discovered until they competed
against each other at the 1936 olympics .
and thankfully , their embarrassment was overshadowed
by the rise of fascism .
其内战被称为 &quot; 小二战 &quot;
let &apos;s see the new phone .
i stopped on the way to work .
hey , do you want to peel the plastic off with me ?
really ? me ?
that &apos;s , like , the best part .
grab a corner .
whoa , what &apos;s your hurry , cowboy ?
savor the moment .
oh , yeah .
speaking of cowboys ,
do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag ?
the tiny landlocked nation of andorra .
oh , the next classic episode
of sheldon cooper presents : fun with flags
is writing itself .
oh , let me try the voice recognition .
hey , i let you peel the plastic , don &apos;t get greedy .
hello ?
hello .
what &apos;s your name ?
my name ? it &apos;s siri .
look at that .
there &apos;s finally a woman in your life you can talk to .
are you single ?
i don &apos;t have a marital status ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
yeah , you &apos;re right , that &apos;s too personal .
we hardly know each other .
how about a cup of coffee ?
i &apos;ve found six coffee shops .
three of them are fairly close to you .
i will see you gentlemen later .
she is gonna break his heart .
for someone who has a machine
that can travel anywhere in time and space ,
doctor who sure does have a thing for modern @-@ day london .
careful , it &apos;s that kind of sass
that can get a person uninvited to this year &apos;s who con.
uh , we &apos;re not counting this as a date , are we ?
um , i &apos;m not sure ,
but i think the right answer here is &quot; no . &quot;
bug report : when a guy asks me to spend time with him ,
maybe he plans something a little more interesting
than hanging out at home , watching tv .
even &lt; i &gt; doctor who ? &lt; / i &gt;
even &lt; i &gt; doctor who . &lt; / i &gt;
all right , that &apos;s it . who con-- you &apos;re out .
okay , bug report taken .
next time i will have a better plan for our evening &apos;s activity .

my bug report to you .
well , that &apos;s quite a list you got there .
it &apos;s color coded .
uh , red means &quot; fix right away . &quot;
yellow is &quot; eh , whenever you get a chance . &quot;
and green , is &quot; i could probably learn to live with it . &quot;
there &apos;s a key down here at the bottom .
it &apos;s neat , huh ?
yep .
so , have a good night .
yep .
look at that .
some day , we will tell future generations
that dating used to be hard .
what &apos;s baffling me is what you could &apos;ve possibly put on the list .
&quot; hair too golden &quot; ?
&quot; laugh too musical &quot; ?
&quot; world too much a better place
for her mere presence in it &quot; ?
how about &quot; constantly talks with food in her mouth &quot; ?
her heart &apos;s full of love , no one cares what &apos;s in her mouth .
so , siri ,
what &apos;s happening ? how are you ?
i am well .
what are you doing right now ?
what am i doing ?
i &apos;m talking with you .
you have a beautiful voice .
thank you , it &apos;s nice to be appreciated .
i bet it is .
why don &apos;t women like me ?
let me check on that .
how about a web search for &quot; why don &apos;t women like me ? &quot;
no need . i &apos;ve already done that .
siri , do you have a last name ?
my name is siri .
ah , one name .
like , uh , cher , madonna , adele .

i found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato .
seven of them are fairly close to you .
thank you , darling .
you are most certainly welcome , sexy .
well done , dr. koothrappali .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you &apos;ve taken a great evolutionary leap
by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself
to romantically bond with a soulless machine .
kudos .
i haven &apos;t bonded with it .
oh , no , of course .
i understand .
you &apos;re afraid the world isn &apos;t ready for your taboo love .
your secret &apos;s safe with me .

two weeks to rock hard abs .
they kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that , don &apos;t they ?
all right .
look , just remember how this works .
we don &apos;t get mad about these things .
uh , speaking of which , i &apos;ve addressed
your bug report on my date planning .
got a really fun evening for you .
it &apos;s kind of a surprise .
all right . terrific .
well , let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren &apos;t so tall .
we wouldn &apos;t want you to feel like you were
out for a walk with your mommy .
thank you .
here &apos;s my list for you-- right there .
all right , fair enough .
i certainly can be quieter when we kiss .
i thought it was an expression of passion ,
but if it &apos;s coming across as &quot; juicy and weird , &quot;
who wants that ?
uh , uh ... i &apos;m sorry .
can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are &quot; stupid &quot; ?
no , never mind . it &apos;s right here .
good timing .
dinner &apos;s almost ready .
great .
oh , smells amazing in here .
oh , what are we eating ?
oh , an exotic little treat .
i was just talking to siri about peking duck ,
and she said she knew about four chinese grocers ,
two of which were fairly close to me .
her spontaneity is contagious .
who &apos;s siri ?
is he dating somebody new ?
yes . his phone .
is that cute or creepy ?
can i pour you some wine ?
i think you &apos;ll enjoy it .
the traditional choice with peking duck
is a sauvignon blanc ,
but siri suggested an off @-@ dry riesling .
威士莲 : 最精致的白葡萄酒品种
i wasn &apos;t sure ,
but i didn &apos;t want to have an argument
with her in the middle of trader joe &apos;s .
now , what should we put siri in for dinner ?
leopard , sparkles ,
or to paraphrase coco chanel ,
you can never go wrong with a little black case ?
siri , play some smooth jazz .
playing smooth jazz .
oh , my god , kenny g ? !
this woman can read me like a book .
i can &apos;t believe i bought my soul mate at glendale galleria .
i don &apos;t know if i want to stay .
this is amazing .
how did you even get this idea
i called your dad .
i asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid .
this seemed easier than getting a cow out here
so you could tip it .
okay , you &apos;re kind of really great .
you mean for a person whose neck massages feel like
an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest ?
okay , bug report .
i just complimented you .
you should take it and shut up .
right . sorry , sorry .
and stop apologizing all the time .
right . sorry .
all right , let &apos;s shoot stuff .
you want me to show you what to do ?
i play a lot of &lt; i &gt; grand theft auto . &lt; / i &gt;
i think i know how to handle a gat .
wow . you are cute when you get all gangsta .
so , i &apos;ve got a gunshot wound .
that &apos;s pretty bad @-@ ass .
no , you &apos;ve got a reebok with a gunshot wound
and an ouchie on your pinky toe .
hello ? they gave me a band @-@ aid .
hospitals do not issue band @-@ aids
unless it is medically necessary .
that is the law .
well , thank you for a really cool evening .
thank you for hiding my &lt; i &gt; star wars &lt; / i &gt; socks
at the emergency room .
is it a good time to evaluate the beta test
and see where we stand ?
things are looking good .
so , are we still taking things slow ?
because a gunshot wound today ,
and last week ,
i slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer .
we don &apos;t know how much time i have .
good night , you .
