第一季 第五集
why is my daughter going to one of your concerts with your son ?
if you want to be part of this world , jenny ,
you need to decide if all this ... is worth it .
look , if you &apos;re ready to leave , you tell us , okay ?
no matter what mom says .
i would really like to get out of here .
i did this .
my mom kinda left us a couple months ago .
my dad and my sister don &apos;t really see that .
i dated a girl like serena once .
your wife would not want this hanging in my house .
she doesn &apos;t do background checks on prospective buyers ,
and neither do i. besides , it &apos;s been almost 20 years .
and you still don &apos;t know women .
hey , how about you ask me out again ?
how about you actually show up ?
okay. no drama , no disruptions , i promise .
promise ? oh , no ! that means it &apos;s never gonna happen now .
aah ! okay , quick . i take it back . i unpromise .
friday . 8 : 00 .
with blair &apos;s boyfriend nate
helping to close up the family yacht for the season ,
blair is free to focus
on the most important event of the fall
her annual sleepover ,
a tradition since the year 2000,
each one more decadent than the last .
no expense or reputation is spared .
with everything from trundle beds to truffles in place ,
all that &apos;s missing
is sleepover star and waldorf b.f.f.
serena van der woodsen .
hey , dad . i &apos;m headed to the bank .
you want me to deposit the check from mom &apos;s sale while i &apos;m there ?
did you knock over a parking meter ?
no , this is the entire contents
from my teenage mutant ninja turtle piggy bank .
how long can a man have a piggy bank
and still call himself a man ?
i th--i thought it was time to break donatello open .
so tonight &apos;s the big night , huh ?
it is , and i have it all planned .
6 pounds of plan , actually .
i know it &apos;s been a while since i took someone on a date ,
but , uh , movie ticket prices haven &apos;t risen that much , have they ?
dad , this is serena van der woodsen .
i can &apos;t just take her to a movie .
i want this to be perfect .
check ?
want me to deposit it ?
you still haven &apos;t told her yet , have you ?
dad , that &apos;s mom first sale .
that painting sold days ago .
it &apos;s kind of a huge deal .
i know , which is why i was thinking of surprising her myself ,
heading upstate to hudson , bringing her the check in person .
what ?
aren &apos;t i supposed to deliver good news in person ?
i think that &apos;s bad news .
good news might just be fine with a phone call .
so you &apos;re saying i shouldn &apos;t go see her ?
i &apos;m saying , i don &apos;t think mom is a huge fan of surprises .
your remember her , uh , 30th birthday
with the clown and his llama ?
yeah , that didn &apos;t ... didn &apos;t go over well .
it tanked .
yeah . i &apos;ll call her first , just to be safe .
need some change for that ?
hey ! just the little sister i was looking for .
i need answers , and i need them now .
your brother is being very mysterious about our date tonight .
well , he &apos;s a very mysterious guy , apparently .
look , he won &apos;t even tell me where we &apos;re going .
can you just give me a hint ?
are we going to some secret club
to see the best unsigned band in brooklyn ?
or--or a guerilla art exhibit in dumbo ?
or , hey , isn &apos;t the new york film festival still going on ?
you don &apos;t leave much room for surprise , do you ?
well , i don &apos;t know how to dress for surprise .
not everything goes with it , you know. well ,
i &apos;d say jeans and a t @-@ shirt is a safe bet .
the humphrey men do casual friday every day. oh .
oh , it &apos;s my brother .
oh , i say hi .
eric , hey ,
jenny says hi. well ,
hi back. did she spill about tonight ?
no , not a drop. you all packed ?
yeah , baggage is ready to go .
hey , speaking of which , is mom still there ?
yeah , she &apos;s talking to the doctor now .
i can &apos;t believe
she &apos;s actually letting me come home for a weekend .
i don &apos;t think i even remember what a weekend is .
what time &apos;s your date ? maybe we &apos;ll cross paths at the palace .
7 : 00 can &apos;t wait to see you .
me , too. bye .
okay , love you , eric. bye .
what was that i heard ? eric &apos;s coming home ?
perfect timing .
how so ?
well , it gives your mother and brother time to bond
alone tonight while you get drunk on schnapps
and moon the n.y.u. dorms from the limo . ,
blair , what are you talking about ?
s. , it &apos;s only the most important night of the fall .
oh , the sleepover .
i prefer &quot; soiree . &quot;
&quot; sleepover &quot; is so sophomore year .
look , you know i can &apos;t go to that . i have that plan .
serena , when there &apos;s a waldorf soiree ,
there &apos;s nothing else on the social calendar .
blair , the plan is dan .
remember ,
the guy you realized is actually a human being
and worthy of your time and attention ?
no offense. none taken .
look , i &apos;m really sorry , but this date is unbreakable .
maybe we can swing by later or something
i &apos;m not a stop along the way .
i &apos;m a destination , and if you refuse to attend ,
i &apos;m gonna have to find a replacement .
girls , the waiting list .
okay. well , uh , i should get going .
bye. good luck tonight .
thank you .
little jenny humphrey. why didn &apos;t i think of you before ?
you have no plans. you &apos;re coming to the soiree .
me ? really ? her ? really ?
the thing is , if you come , you &apos;ll have to be up
to a little more than just sleeping .
i &apos;m up for anything .
my place . 7 : 00 sharp .
okay. bye .
oh , a girl &apos;s first sleepover
something she &apos;ll never forget .
let &apos;s make sure of it .
taking bets on how long she lasts ?
50 bucks say an hour and not 1 minute more .
i don &apos;t understand. he said i was ready .
we talked about it in our session this morning .
what he said is that you could come home , not that you should .
but , mom , i thought
i don &apos;t wanna argue about this .
i need time to think .
please. look ,
i told the doctor i would take it under advisement .
you can &apos;t just walk out of here anyway .
there &apos;s papers that have to be signed ,
release forms , insurance
i can &apos;t believe you.you want to keep me here forever .
if you still think i &apos;m &quot; keeping you here , &quot;
that just proves how not ready you are to come home .
look , we &apos;ll talk about this tomorrow .
yeah. yeah , you bet we will .
hey , uh , am i early or ...
no. no , i , uh , i &apos;m just running late .
come in .
um ... excuse me while i go slip into something less comfortable .
sure , sure .
talk to me while i change ?
i will.okay.
say , it &apos;s a nice place that you and ...
800 other people have got here .
yeah , the , uh , identical surroundings
do make you crazy after a little while .
sometimes i feel like
i &apos;m in a secret government experiment .
most government experiments
don &apos;t have plasma tvs or maid services.just something i &apos;ve noticed .
dan .
does serena know you &apos;re here ?
yeah , of course. yeah , she let me in .
at least , i hope that was her .
she &apos;s about , uh , yea tall and very blonde ?
it makes jokes. cute .
big shopping day ?
i had a lot on my mind .
so where are you taking my daughter tonight ?
i ... i don &apos;t know . i thought maybe we &apos;d do
a walking tour of new york underground ,
visit my friends the mole people .
they &apos;re great , except they only ever eat leftovers .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t know why i just said any of that .
i have--i have this thing , this nervous tic where i never stop speaking ,
in fact , when i was a little boy , my mom used to say
there was never a word i met that i didn &apos;t like .
you know what else i like ?
your daughter.i @-@ i really like your daughter .
i ... wow .
you &apos;re not wearing that with that , are you ?
uh , mom ...

oh , my gosh. you don &apos;t understand .
i spent one of my favorite summers riding all around italy
on one of these. how did you know ?

but really , dan , this is amazing. really .

mr. humphrey .

yeah .
okay , great .
spotted on the steps of the palace
cinderella stepping onto a pumpkin
instead of her carriage .
lucky for lonely boy ,

i will take that for you , yes ?
jenny ! oh , i &apos;m so glad you could make it .

wow. even i &apos;m impressed .
um , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , don &apos;t really ... feel right .
well , as my mother always says , &quot; fashion knows not of comfort . &quot;
all that matters is the face you show the world ,
and your face looks like it &apos;s going to a bat mitzvah .
but before we continue the renovation ...
martini .
oh , no , thanks . i don &apos;t like vodka .
oh , that &apos;s nice , because this is gin ,
as it should be .
it &apos;s a party , jenny .
either swallow that or swipe your metrocard back home .
it &apos;s up to you .
all right , people. who &apos;s ready for a game of &quot; truth or dare &quot; ?
oh , i love &quot; truth or dare . &quot;
once i had to eat an entire bag of marshmallows .
that &apos;s nice , little humphrey , but , um , that &apos;s not how we play .

what &apos;s it gonna be ?
do or die , little j . ?
spotlight on little j ,
now put to the test by one queen b .

i think the only thing being lost in this game would be your dignity .

this better not be my wife .
rufus , do you always answer the phone like that ?

eric is missing .
missing ? from where ?
from ...
his--his room here ...
at the hotel .
i--i &apos;m trying to get in touch with him ,
but he &apos;s not answering his phone . i think he &apos;s with serena .
did you try her ?
she left her phone here .
your son &apos;s cell number-- that &apos;s all i need .
they &apos;re on a date , lil .
if they picked eric up along the way ,

i have a situation here .
a situation ?
your son is with your daughter and my kid .
i trust them. why don &apos;t you ?
rufus .
good @-@ bye , lily. always a pleasure .
hey , baby , you want to ,
uh , maybe show me to the bathroom ,
get lost somewhere around the coat check ?
well , my answer is usually &quot; never say never , &quot;
but for you ,
i &apos;ll make an exception .
who let the hedge fund mafia in here ?
i thought matchy @-@ matchy was over .
so eric &apos;s here .
now it &apos;s your turn. truth or dare ?

i dare you to make out with that guy .
easy .
and mean it .

just my girlfriend .
amanda never has to know , does she ?
well , i &apos;m not telling her .
look what i got .
oh ! i dare you to call his girlfriend .
her name &apos;s amanda .
done and done .
hello ?
amanda ?
hi. this is bl
claire .
yeah , i just had my tongue down your boyfriend &apos;s throat ,
and he neglected to tell me you existed until after it was over .
just thought you should know .
he &apos;s a real catch .
bye .
all right , sleepover of the year. whoo !
hey , everybody &apos;s gotta start somewhere .
maybe little j. isn &apos;t so little anymore .
game over. you lost fair and square ,
and that &apos;s squared .
oh ! am i really that bad ?
there aren &apos;t enough words to describe the kind of bad you are .
oh ! well , you promised if you lost again , you &apos;d teach me .
all right. all right .
that &apos;s a promise i intend to keep , not just for you ,
but for dive bars everywhere
all across america. whoo !
all right , come here .
now you have to remember , in pool , it &apos;s all about
take this stick--remember , it &apos;s all about the angles ,
the right angle , of course .
take the shot. okay .
um , bring your hand back here .
right .
and , uh , wait. oh , okay. hold on .
you gotta be slow and just follow through , all right ?
oh ! this is my song. finally .
i didn &apos;t know you liked this kind of music .
i think we &apos;ve already established the things
you don &apos;t know about me .
oh , oth--other than your , uh ,
total lack of pools skills , what else ?
um , that i &apos;m having the best time right now ?
that i knew .
ahem. there &apos;s something vibrating in your pocket ,
and i really hope it &apos;s your phone .
hold on .
oh , it &apos;s my dad. he knows i &apos;m with you .
he wouldn &apos;t call if it wasn &apos;t important .
oh , yeah , of course. take it. ah .
hello ?
what ? no , no , no , he &apos;s not .
serena left her phone at the hotel ?
what ? what &apos;s up ? oh , uh ... yeah , yeah , yeah .
dad , she &apos;s standing right here next to me .
we &apos;ll take care of it .
wait , take care of what ?
slight change of plans .
no ! no , no. no change of plans .
i like this plan of you teaching me the angles .
i know .
remember , cute girl with total lack of pool skills ?
i remember. so does the table .
come on , what could it possibly be
that &apos;s more important than this right here ?
can &apos;t it wait till tomorrow ?
actually , it can &apos;t . you need to call your brother right now .
hey . i was just about-- so i made some calls ,
but as it turns out , none of my people know your people .
shocking , but true .
either &quot; dan humphrey &quot; is an alias
or your son is not very popular .
regardless , i need that number .
i realized when i got off the phone with you
that i could &apos;ve been a little bit more understanding .
you think-- i called dan .
thank you .
and your son &apos;s not with them .
he &apos;s not ?
but serena got eric on the phone ,
and he &apos;s okay ,
and dan said they would phone when they were all together .
yeah , and you didn &apos;t think to call and tell me all of this ?
i was just about to .
now i hate to say this , but why don &apos;t you sit and wait here ?
we should hear from them soon .
fine .
and i &apos;ll pass on a glass of that nonpremium liquor that you &apos;re drinking .
but i will take something to eat .
thank you for offering .
what ? you still know how to cook , don &apos;t you ?
do you see jenny or your brother ?
no .
are you her ? are you claire ?
what ? no .
uh , are you sure we &apos;re in the right place ?
yeah .
come on .
where is she ? hey ! whoa , whoa .
baby. what ? who ? i &apos;m here at the club with the guys .
excuse me. hello. where &apos;s my phone ?
hey , hey , let go of her. who the hell are you ?
your phone is at our table .
if you weren &apos;t so drunk
and drooling over every girl in this place ,
you would &apos;ve seen that .
i &apos;m gonna kill you . oh , you must be amanda , right ?
well , i would think twice before marrying him
&apos;cause he &apos;s a pig .
wait. hey , hey. back off of her , okay ?
i don &apos;t need you to defend me .
it wasn &apos;t even her who called you.it was me .
jenny ?
so she &apos;s the one with the tongue ?
tongue ? tongue-- what are you even doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be at a sleepover .
you made out with a girl from a sleepover ?
you made out with him ?
i made out with her .
ew. it was a dare .
a dare ? what are you , children ?
yeah , pretty much. she &apos;s 14 .
14 ? !
14 ? ! jesus. no , i swear i had no idea , baby .
i mean , look at her . i mean , she &apos;s jailbait .
what--what &apos;s that ?
dan , stay out of it , okay ?
you &apos;re just causing more problems than you &apos;re solving .
the only thing causing a problem is the cocktail napkin you &apos;re wearing .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
you &apos;re not talking about anything .
dan ! hey !
all right , all you out before i call the cops. all right , all right .
hey , serena. see ? i told you everything was okay .
let &apos;s go , come on .
eric , come on .
spotted big brother to the not @-@ quite rescue .
too bad no one told him
you can &apos;t save a damsel
if she loves her distress .
what &apos;s wrong with the sauce ? mmm .
oh , nothing , i &apos;m just so happy to have a home @-@ cooked meal .
it just needs a little salt. what ? it &apos;s perfect .
no , just a--just a pinch .
you haven &apos;t changed a bit .
you always have to be in control .
hmm. well , i don &apos;t remember you complaining .
well , i wasn &apos;t allowed to. it was one of your rules .
yeah , well , i may hold the reins a little tight ,
but life is complicated ,
especially once you have kids .
you know , when they &apos;re little , you &apos;re their whole world .
and then one day , the wall goes up ,
and you &apos;re on one side , and they &apos;re on the other .
well , they don &apos;t like to admit it ,
but they want us to break through .
yeah , well , maybe serena ,
but eric-- i don &apos;t know what he wants .
you &apos;re awfully concerned about
a 14 @-@ year @-@ old boy breaking curfew .
well , it &apos;s not my curfew he &apos;s breaking .
he &apos;s been staying at the ostroff center .
ostroff center ?
mm @-@ hmm. yeah .
is it drugs ? drinking ?
um , no , he &apos;s not a bad kid .
he &apos;s just--just , um , a lonely one .
it &apos;s depression ? is it bad ?
bad enough to try to kill himself .
i &apos;m sorry .
no , i don &apos;t know why .
i don &apos;t know what i did or i didn &apos;t do , but ...
i just don &apos;t know what to do
to--to make sure it doesn &apos;t happen again .
all you can do is be there for them .
oh , i hope that &apos;s dan or serena .
hello ?
hey , great .
uh , yeah .
actually , i can tell her. his mother &apos;s here with me .
it &apos;s a long story .
sounds good. take care .
so he &apos;s with dan and serena ,
and everyone &apos;s fine .
all right , i should go meet them .
i &apos;ll wrap this up .
no. you know what ? this isn &apos;t gonna travel well .
why don &apos;t i just stay here and i can eat it quickly ?
it would be a shame to let it go to waste .
what were you thinking ?
he was bored. he wanted to get out and have some fun .
so you took him to a bar ?
he didn &apos;t do anything wrong.i thought you &apos;d be happy .
well , i &apos;m not , okay ?
i @-@ i can &apos;t believe that you did this .
hey , i wasn &apos;t kidnapped , serena . i left of my own free will .
blair was trying to do me a favor .
told you .
well , it &apos;s no favor , eric. you &apos;re in a lot of trouble .
yeah , i know ,
and you know what ? it was worth it ...
to be out after dark and to talk to someone who isn &apos;t just you or mom ,
even if it is blair .
no offense .
none taken .
well , i &apos;m sorry this was the only way .
we &apos;ll work on mom , okay ?
thanks .
and since she knows you &apos;re okay ,
i guess there &apos;s no real reason to rush .
how about we walk ?
oh , call me .
yeah , i will .
i was talking to eric .
what is wrong with you ? this is not who you are .
and who are you right now ? dad ?
uh , we are not doing this right now .
we can do this at home. let &apos;s go .
except i &apos;m not going home . i &apos;m going with my friends .
coming , jenny ?
yeah. one second .
look , all right , i &apos;m sorry that things got out of hand tonight .
to say the least .
i know who blair and those girls are ,
but i know who i am ,
and i &apos;m not gonna forget that just &apos; cause i hang out with them .
come on ! we &apos;re leaving !
i &apos;m coming !
just let me go. please ?
i mean , look , i &apos;ll be tucked in bed in a half @-@ hour .
i promise .
uh , all right , all right , all right. yeah , go ahead .
thank you .
hey. i , uh , i gotta take him back to the center .
so we should probably just call it a night .
what ? no , no , no , no , no.i &apos;ll go with you .
no , it &apos;s okay. you don &apos;t have to .
i want to. come on. let &apos;s go .
this just in &quot; truth or dare &quot; has gone into overtime .
looks like no one told little j .
that you don &apos;t beat a waldorf at her own game .
you want me to steal the jacket from the mannequin ?
that &apos;s right .
blair , it &apos;s your mom &apos;s store .
i mean , you could have anything you want .
so can you ...
unless you don &apos;t want to , which is totally understandable ,
and i wouldn &apos;t judge you for that .
i don &apos;t get it .
then you don &apos;t have to do it .
it &apos;s just a shame , &apos; cause you &apos;ve come so far .
the jacket ?
just the jacket .
oh , god .
five , four , three ,
two , one .
okay , come on , run .
guys ! come back ! let me out !
are you still the same guy you were when i took this photo ?
what ? you took that photo ? you weren &apos;t even at that show .
oh , excuse me. if i remember , the first song was about me ,
the second one was about your motorcycle
and then there was the one about that surf town. what was it ?
sayulita .
sayulita. fishermen &apos;s town .
was that the one with the villa where we ...
yes , indeed , it was .
god , i must have taken eight rolls of film that night .
wh--why did you give up photography anyway ?
you loved it so much .
well , i guess i figured , um ,
social climbing would be more fulfilling .
i even remember the black dress i wore that night .
really ? yeah .
you know , i think it may have actually been blue .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t remember me being there .
uh , can you grab that , lil ?
and if it &apos;s my son , be nice to him .
hello , humphrey residence .
hi , alison .
yeah , it &apos;s , um , lily .
yeah. h @-@ hold on. just ...
alison ?
looks like you &apos;re gonna have some explaining to do .
trust me , i don &apos;t owe alison any explanation right now .
you know what ? i &apos;ve overstayed my welcome .
okay .
i hope everything turns out all right .
yeah , me , too. thanks for babysitting me ,
and thank you for being such a good friend .
yeah .
it was almost fun .
good night , rufus .
i &apos;m gonna need you to show me
some form of identification , miss .
i &apos;m only 14 . i don &apos;t have any .
what are you doing out at this hour ?
i , um ... what &apos;s your name ?
my name is blair waldorf. this is my mother &apos;s shop .
her name is eleanor . i left my jacket here earlier ,
i mean--which irritates my mother to no end .
and i completely forgot about the alarm .
all right , what &apos;s your home phone number so we can call her ?
oh , she &apos;s not home . i mean , she &apos;s in paris until thursday .
it &apos;s six hours ahead if you want to call .
she &apos;s gonna be so angry .
well , look , we can &apos;t just let you go
without confirming your story .
i have my own set of keys .
you can watch me lock up .
well , i can see why your brother would want to leave .
that place is , uh , is very depressing .
and yet , it &apos;s designed to treat depression .
he &apos;s a good kid--eric. he is .
yeah. jenny &apos;s not so bad either .
yeah ?
yeah. yeah , i @-@ i @-@ i know . i know .
i just worry about her sometimes .
well , worry looks cute on you .
look , i &apos;ve seen jenny in action ,
and my hunch is
she doesn &apos;t let herself get pushed in anything she doesn &apos;t want to do .
no , i @-@ i know . i know. it &apos;s just ...
she &apos;s never mentioned that her idea of a great friday night
consists of painting her face full of makeup ,
and stumbling out to a hip bar in high heels
and hanging out with a bunch of drunk wall streeters
who don &apos;t even care if she has a name .
well , maybe that wasn &apos;t her idea of a great friday night .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s okay for her to want to be friends with the people she goes to school with .
why ? i &apos;m not .
uh @-@ huh , and if you made half the effort she did ,
maybe we would &apos;ve met a long time ago .
that &apos;s true .
then so maybe you would &apos;ve kissed me already .
no five @-@ star restaurants .
no town car .
no smoky pool hall or bad &apos; 80s music .
looks like we finally found common ground .
hey , mom. sorry about tonight .
no , we &apos;ll talk about it in the morning ,
after you &apos;ve had a good night &apos;s sleep in your own bed .
i &apos;m going home ?
i &apos;m not sure exactly how this is gonna work , you know .
hey , i &apos;m not worried .
it &apos;s a good thing i didn &apos;t unpack .
catch .
jenny ?
well , well. looks like you came to play after all .
you know which trundle bed is yours .
sleep tight. you &apos;ve earned it .
actually , i &apos;m going home , but , uh ,
thanks for inviting me. it was a blast .
what do you mean you &apos;re going home ?
nobody ever leaves a sleepover .
well , i guess there &apos;s firsts for everything .
oh , and i &apos;m keeping the jacket ,
if that &apos;s okay with you .
monday ? lunch on the steps ?
done and done .
word is jenny humphrey killed
at blair waldorf &apos;s sleepover .
it was a debut the likes of which haven &apos;t been seen since blair herself .
if blair &apos;s gotta watch her back ,
serena &apos;s needs to keep an eye on her heart .
we hear it may have been stolen by lonely boy .
putting out an a.p.b ,
gossip girl .
