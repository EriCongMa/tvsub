this is why i buy my food from gas stations , jess .
nick , you knocked over a wheelbarrow
full of fruit , and then you actually skipped away .
guys , i &apos;m trying to concentrate , okay ?
the lapd does not offer entrance exams
every single day .
just mondays and fridays .
but i am not waiting till friday .
hey , why do you have so much fruit ?
because this one ran into his ex @-@ girlfriend
at the farmer &apos;s market .
nick ?
hey ! no way !
caroline of my past .
what a pleasant surprise .
my ex @-@ lover ... no !
i don &apos;t deal with exes .
they &apos;re part of the past .
you burn &apos; em swiftly
and you give their ashes to poseidon .
i &apos;m really good friends with berkley ,
we had a terrible break up . what .
you have a good relationship with him
because he wants to bone you .
he &apos;s a stay @-@ at @-@ home dad .
his entire life revolves around his family .
he &apos;s the most emotionally evolved person i know .
and i &apos;m sure his favorite emotion is the emotion
of wanting to bone you .
that &apos;s not an emotion .
possible sex is the only reason
people stay &quot; friends &quot; with their exes .
come on .
back me up , winnie the bish .
yeah , that &apos;s true . i mean ,
i &apos;m friends with all my exes ...
see ?
... families .
ha @-@ ha ! see ?
i still send shelby &apos;s dad
a father &apos;s day card , and he still sends me
five bucks on my birthday .
what is wrong with you ?
that &apos;s nice .
hey , guys .
i bet coach is friends with his exes .
no .
oh , for sure , yeah .
yeah ! i &apos;m right !
for sex .
no .
ha @-@ ha ! i &apos;m right !
can &apos;t spell &quot; sex &quot; with the &quot; ex . &quot;
man , is that sexy when he does that .
announcement , i finally finished my loft .
hold the applause .
let &apos;s go . all right .
come on .
c @-@ come on , you guys .
all together , now .
we &apos;re not ... who &apos;s coming ?
let &apos;s go . come on , nick .
i don &apos;t want to go , man . thanks for the invite .
nah , come on .
winnie .
no ?
you and caroline still need some closure .
well , what do you want me to say ?
that i walked out on her and now i &apos;m dating you ?
we started dating , like , a year after you broke up .
yeah , but that doesn &apos;t matter with her .
she &apos;s got a crazy streak ,
and this is bound to set her off .
what if she hurts me physically ?
what if she hurts me with words ?
just talk to her . clear the air .
you &apos;ll feel better , she &apos;ll feel better .
besides , nick ,
i can &apos;t give up that farmer &apos;s market .
strolling around , chatting with vendors--
it &apos;s so nice .
i feel like don corleone .
i think a lot of ladies do .
sorry about that .
haven &apos;t spoken to anybody all day .
phlegm buildup , you know ?
i &apos;ve been cooped up all day in my loft apartment .
so much space for one person , you know ?
you could scream in there , nobody would ever hear you .
i &apos;m gonna go .
bye .
what is going on ?
may i speak plainly with you , cecilia ?
i &apos;m in a bit of a sexual drought .
the good valley schmidt hasn &apos;t
seen rain in months .
you &apos;re just ... you &apos;re giving off a creepy vibe .
all right ? living alone is messing up your game
and it &apos;s making you weird .
yeah , but i love living alone .
where are you , grapes ?
grápés .
great apes .
grapes , we have you surrounded .
come out with your stems up !
i guess my game could be upped
if i increased my ... my human contact
a little bit .
good . because you &apos;re caressing your own arm right now .
that &apos;s not normal , man .
i &apos;ve been working out . it feels ... i don &apos;t ...
i just want to know why you walked out .
was there something else going on ?
was there someone else ?
can i just say ,
i really wish this coffee was a giant beer .
and i wish this scone was a @-@ a whiskey
and i could just drink one ... just chase &apos; em .
this is nice .
glad we &apos;re doing this .
so how &apos;d it go ?
we gabbed like a couple of washer women over the back fence .
that &apos;s great . so proud of you .
you two are dating ?
i knew it . i knew it was her !
what ... ?
you didn &apos;t tell her we were together ? !
i told her we were together .
i &apos;m not getting away with this . i didn &apos;t tell her .
screw you , miller !
i don &apos;t understand . you guys talked for 30 minutes .
how did our relationship not come up ?
&apos;cause i got scared .
there were so many things that i wanted to tell her .
you ever thought how weird it would be
if you just gave up your thumb ?
you just didn &apos;t have a thumb .
i mean , how would you give a thumbs up ? just like this ?
i think a guy died in the building , &apos; cause one day
in the dumpster is a bunch of clothes that just fit me .
what i like to do now is take the underground , yeah ?
spend my quid . cheers ?
oh , crap . this is her .
she thinks i cheated , jess .
you know who you should talk to ? berkley .
he &apos;s so good at this stuff-- friendship , closure .
actually , he did write a book about it . it &apos;s an e @-@ book .
i gave it four stars , but it kind of falls apart at the end .
he goes into god in a way i don &apos;t think he needs to .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna text him ?
why would i talk to your ex @-@ boyfriend
about my ex @-@ girlfriend ?
well , you need his help .
you &apos;re right .
no , no , no .
give me . can i see ? can i see ?
can i see ?
yeah . yeah .
&quot; hey , babe ... &quot; don &apos;t call him &quot; babe . &quot;
it &apos;s just what we call each other .
&quot; bf problems &quot; ?
my boyfriend is having problems .
xoxo ?
it &apos;s a really common greeting .
&quot; kissing you , hugging you , kissing you , hugging you &quot; ?
what else am i gonna write ? &quot; o @-@ o @-@ o &quot; ?
that just looks like &quot; oh ... &quot;
you &apos;re leading him on , jess .
oh , nick .
you are .
berkley &apos;s really gonna teach you a lot .
men don &apos;t talk to people they &apos;ve dated
unless they want sex , or they &apos;re winston .
i also want sex .
going to schmidt &apos;s .
he &apos;s been begging us to all week .
jess , men are sick .
look , i &apos;m a relatively good guy , but even i &apos;m a sicko .
luckily , we have the internet as a community of ...
oh , this is terrible !
she &apos;s quoting scriptures ,
but using tons of cuss words .
this is as bad as it gets with caroline .
okay .
berkley &apos;s around the corner at his baby &apos;s world music class .
okay , you know what ? i &apos;m in .
great .
what kind of beer does berkley like ?
he doesn &apos;t .
oh , great .
i cannot wait to meet him .
fellas .
you made it . as promised , here &apos;s a coupon for a free sub .
probably get ham .
wow , man .
it &apos;s nice inside of here , man .
yeah .
it &apos;s like a european airport .
oh , what &apos;s that ?
uh , you want to watch the game ?
which one ? basketball ? football ?
of thrones ?
that is awesome , man .
look at this place , schmidt .
you got so many plush surfaces .
well , there are 15 different bang spots in here ,
each one specifically designated to its own sexual position .
that &apos;s standing , this is sitting , that &apos;s diagonal .
that &apos;s how i do it .
the &quot; why ? why ? because . &quot;
the &quot; closure of the lincoln tunnel . &quot;
the &quot; red beanbag chair . &quot;
which is pretty obvious , but , you know , that &apos;s a good one .
the &quot; glass menagerie . &quot;
the &quot; bike share . &quot;
nice .
the &quot; backwards oops . &quot;
what is &quot; backwards oops &quot; ?
you don &apos;t want to put it ... mm .
you don &apos;t know what it means .
i mean , i don &apos;t ...
i &apos;ve done it , i &apos;ve done it ,
but i didn &apos;t know i was doing it . you know , it was ...
super cool , dude .
i wish i had my own place .
guys , mi casa es su casa .
i even made you guys keys .
what ?
check these out . that one &apos;s yours .
aw , it looks like a guitar .
yeah , that &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re rocking .
mine &apos;s a ...
it &apos;s a rainbow kissing a star .
you like it ?
yeah .
guys , hang out here anytime you want .
even now . who &apos;s thirsty ?
right there .
dude !
shut up !
damn , man .
you &apos;re like james bond .
but i &apos;ll be ... i &apos;ll be moneypenny for sure .
yeah .
wait , which one is moneypenny ?
it &apos;s the woman .
so , did the store have that , uh ,
bamboo highchair you were looking for ?
no , not the one i wanted .
so i think i &apos;m just gonna ...
order it online .
you still got it .
you still got it .
big deal , i &apos;ve been online , too . i still got it .
it &apos;s different .
so , this is the problem .
nick didn &apos;t tell his ex that we were together ,
and she found out , and now she &apos;s really , really upset .
this is the scariest one yet .
it &apos;s just a bunch of smiley faces .
okay , um , not to be all guy with a baby ,
but , uh , exes are really a lot like newborns , okay ?
the burps can be so yucky ,
but you know what comes after a burp ?
what ?
a big old smile .
what the hell are you talking about ?
it was a metaphor , nick .
it was a classic fatherhood metaphor .
no , my @-@ my point is you just need to face her
and let her get it all off her chest .
oh , i feel like i &apos;ve done that .
no , you didn &apos;t .
you just talked and talked about nothing for 30 minutes .
okay , look , i know it &apos;s hard , i know that , man .
i &apos;m here and i &apos;m hearing it .
i mean , when jess and i did this ,
i think we cried for , like ... two days ?
i mean , at least . but look .
now i have such a good friend , and we talk all the time ,
and he &apos;s such a good listener .
say what ? i can &apos;t hear you .
is this real ?
you guys saw each other naked , and now you &apos;re friends ?
yes , it &apos;s the purest form of friendship .
straight leno and eubanks .
i just want to say you &apos;re incredible ,
and i &apos;m so lucky to have you in my life .
okay , i take your advice .
what do we got ?
&quot; my bad . let &apos;s be friends , &apos; kay ? &quot;
smooth , but tough .
that &apos;s not good , nick .
friendship is a , um ...
it &apos;s like a beautiful flower .
you have to nourish it , okay ?
you can &apos;t just buy it at a store .
all right .
first of all , it was a draft , okay , and i &apos;ll fix it .
and second of all , with all due respect ,
you can buy a flower at a store .
millered !
i know as an angel you usually sleep in heaven ,
but would you care to spend the evening at my place ?
i think maybe i would .
fantastic choice .
here &apos;s my address .
there &apos;s usually no place to park .
well , so where would i ... ?
you &apos;re a big girl .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
just try south and sixth .
there &apos;s usually a string of open spaces down there .
and there &apos;s not a right turn on red on fifth-- just fyi .
okay , here &apos;s the deal .
i &apos;ve been wanting to end things with claire for years now .
and i &apos;m gonna do it , it &apos;s gonna take one phone call .
what ?
she &apos;s gonna burn all my clothes on the lawn .
i don &apos;t care . i only want to wear henleys anyways .
jess , we can finally be together .
what ? !
wait , no , but leave your wife ? !
for you . i &apos;m gonna leave my wife for you .
wait , what ... ?
&quot; thank you for being so incredible . &quot;
&quot; so lucky to have you in my life &quot; ?
jess .
when you said those words , i knew .
no .
berkley , there &apos;s been a fundamental misunderstanding here .
you know the last time claire thanked me for anything ?
it was when i was pulling out her chair at our wedding .
no ... she doesn &apos;t appreciate me like you do .
no , it &apos;s not happening . no , no ...
aah ! damn it , winston ! oh , god .
pretend this is attached , and there &apos;s water coming out .
