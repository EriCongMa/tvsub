gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i &apos;m assuming you are cousin charlie .
i &apos;d like to stay .
why don &apos;t i show you your new room ?
i know you don &apos;t wanna hear from me ,
but dan humphrey
kissed blair waldorf .
you said that you were responsible for a fire
in one of your own buildings .
i &apos;ve had that man &apos;s death on my conscience for 20 years .
someone died ?
why do you think the security guard
was in the building ? he was trying to save my wife .
my dad always said she never tried to contact us ,
but i can &apos;t help but wonder ,
since he lied about so much other stuff ...
i called the d.a. ten minutes ago .
once i go on record with the truth ,
no one can hold this against us anymore .
we can build our futures together .
now that i know i &apos;m ready , i realize you &apos;re not .
i think i just met a real @-@ life prince .
will i ever see you again ?
you can always come find me .
diamonds are a girl &apos;s best friend ,
but ask any upper east side girl
to show you her most prized possession ...
and we bet the box is vivier ,
not cartier .
miss blair , you have not taken off the shoes
since it arrived .
you must rest your feet .
there &apos;s no time for rest .
didn &apos;t you read louis &apos; note ?
he wants to spend the day with me , and we still haven &apos;t
picked out the perfect dress .
where &apos;s serena ?
at van der woodsens &apos; .
miss serena been
very good daughter since miss lily get sentenced
to house arrest .
well , now she &apos;s gonna be a very good friend
because i &apos;m going to raid her closet .
but the truth is just because the shoe fits ,
doesn &apos;t mean you want to wear it .
hey , mom . we &apos;re back from our tour
of the best pastry shops in manhattan .
i did a linzer tart taste test .
i had three espressos
and then i picked a fight with a barista .
then i have the perfect place for you to channel your energy .
laryssa is out running errands , and i need someone
to help me clear this out before everyone gets here .
by &quot; this , &quot; do you mean the spoils
of your online shopping safari ?
and by &quot; everyone , &quot; you mean , uh--
i invited the planning committee to help put together
the gift bags for the pink party .
i figure it &apos;s the least i can do ,
and it &apos;d be nice to hang with the girls .
and they &apos;re--they &apos;re coming ?
why wouldn &apos;t they ?
well , i just thought that , you know , with the--
nonsense . they &apos;re my friends .
eric , do you mind helping mom ?
i , uh , need to talk to charlie about something privately .
thanks for the movies .
you wanna come over later and join us for some screenings ?
um ... you know what ? i might--i might have a thing .
a thing ?
that &apos;s intriguingly vague .
another development
in the complicated non @-@ friends hang @-@ out situation ?
no , that situation has figured itself out .
it &apos;s official . we &apos;re , uh , we &apos;re just friends .
uh , no , the thing today is actually a job .
i got a call from the editor of &quot; paris match &quot;
read my blog in &quot; w , &quot;
wants me to do some additional reporting
on a story for them today .
dan , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s fantastic .
i know . i know . i know .
i should be , uh , happy ,
but it--the piece seems kinda sleazy .
the editor got some tip that this european prince
is gonna be in town ,
wants to do a day @-@ in @-@ the @-@ life story ,
like what a royal does in new york ,
and the guy doesn &apos;t like the media , apparently ,
which in this case is me , so that means i gotta follow him .
and we &apos;re talking staking out his hotel .
provided this prince isn &apos;t rolling
with lindsay lohan ,
i don &apos;t know what he has to hide .
i think it &apos;s a great opportunity .
well , uh , let the record show i put up a valiant fight .
uh , speaking of fights ,
where do things stand with you and vanessa ?
have you guys talked ?
uh , yes , only to reiterate the fact
that we have nothing to talk about .
you know , i was angry with vanessa , too ,
but you guys have been friends your whole lives .
that &apos;s not something you give up without some thought .
this say &quot; sexy and smart . &quot;
no , it says &quot; let &apos;s get dinner and make a sex tape . &quot;
keep looking .
hello ?
bonjour , blair . c &apos;est louis .
did you get the package i sent you ?
of course i did .
although i @-@ i must say i was a bit surprised .
i @-@ i thought you &apos;d never wanted to see me again
after the way i left you in paris .
no , not at all , unless the reason
you left paris is still in your life .
uh ... no , no . he isn &apos;t . um , that &apos;s over .
then we are both free with ,
i hope , a perfect day ahead of us .
exactly , and you are in my country now .
i &apos;m going to introduce you to all the best new york has to offer .
tell your valet to press your suit ,
because following an afternoon
of museums and cafes , we &apos;re going to the pink party ,
an exclusive gathering of new york &apos;s elite society .
i &apos;m afraid ...
no one but you can know i &apos;m here , blair .
is that okay ?
of course .
i &apos;ve recently learned of a few places
that nobody like us would ever be caught dead in ,
so i &apos;m going to create you a new itinerary and text you
where we should meet. à très bient ? t .
impatiente de te voir .
moi aussi .
what &apos;s with the emergency text ? we &apos;re gonna be late for class .
oh , i &apos;m not making it to class today ,
which is why you &apos;ll be taking notes for me .
but it &apos;s nearly finals . what &apos;s more important than school ?
miss blair has a date with--
actually , i &apos;d rather not say who just yet .
i &apos;m taking a page from gwyneth and chris .
the relationship means too much to me
to be dissected by the masses .
hand me that m.c.l. cuff i gave you for christmas .
oh , perfect .
if she won &apos;t say who it is ,
i know someone who can find out for us .
okay , so the idea is that
we search the &quot; gossip girl &quot; archives
for evidence of dan and blair sneaking around
so you know for sure if vanessa &apos;s telling the truth ?
that &apos;s the basic idea .
and ... i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m still new at this .
how is that better than just asking them ?
well , because if vanessa is lying and it isn &apos;t true ,
then i &apos;m a horrible friend for believing her ,
but if it is true , then they &apos;re horrible friends
for not telling me .
right there .
they went out of town together .
oh , that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
they went to cornwall to find juliet because
she drugged me and tried to convince everyone i was crazy .
sure ... &apos; cause that happens . they were spotted seeing a film
called &quot; nétte &quot; at the film forum .
dan lives at the film forum , and blair was obsessed
with that orangutan .
it could be a coincidence .
hey , upper east siders ,
word is that b. is headed for a secret rendezvous .
question is , with who ?
okay , are you ready to help me out ,
upper east side style ?
first , i need to teach you
how to use the &quot; gossip girl &quot; spotted &quot; map .
dan &apos;s standing outside of some restaurant
called vessel @-@ ka , but he &apos;s definitely acting weird .
veselka , and guilty @-@ weird or hungry @-@ weird ?
the man loves his pierogies .
you know , i &apos;m not very good at this .
maybe you should just come down here and see for yourself .
see , i can &apos;t .
that &apos;s the double @-@ edged sword of &quot; gossip girl . &quot; i &apos;d be spotted .
okay . he &apos;s going inside . stand by .
someone else just arrived in a town car .
humphrey ! you have to leave .
no one can see me here , and although you fall
under that moniker , i still need you to go .
me ? wh @-@ what are you doing here , deep in n.y.u. territory ?
if you &apos;ve developed a passion for ukrainian food ,
then i think we did spend too much time together .
actually , i &apos;m on a date . you can handle that , right ?
we &apos;re just friends . date away .
okay . you didn &apos;t see me here .
okay .
i &apos;m sorry , serena , but it &apos;s blair .
she &apos;s inside with dan right now .
i think ...
i think they &apos;re on a date .
poor s. apparently , blair and dan &apos;s boots
are made for walking ...
right all over you .
look who it is !
blair and
serena !
louis !
bonjour , serena .
nice to see you .
excuse us .
it was so romantic .
my vivier arrived with a note from louis .
usually i &apos;d make him wait a standard 48 hours
before going on a date , but i make exceptions for royalty .
and you bring royalty to veselka .
believe me , i &apos;d rather be at petrossian ,
but he &apos;s here in secret , so he has to keep a low profile ,
and what &apos;s lower than this ?
look , serena , you can &apos;t say anything to anyone .
as much as i &apos;d love to tell the world ,
this must remain a secret for now .
i won &apos;t say a word , but i do expect a full report .
of course . it &apos;ll start like this . &quot; once upon a time ... &quot;
a girl kept her date waiting too long . go , go , go .
so what happened ?
blair wasn &apos;t with dan . she was with a guy named louis grimaldi .
they met in paris last summer .
but i saw dan go in .
you &apos;ve met so many people in such a short amount of time ,
anyone would get confused .
i remember him . i &apos;m telling you , it was dan .
look , you did great . we have confirmation that blair
wasn &apos;t with dan and that vanessa was lying .
mission accomplished . you ready to go uptown ?
um ... you know , actually , can i meet you later ?
i was hoping i could check out n.y.u. while i was down here .
yeah , of course . have fun .
all i know about my mom is that her name is every thorpe ,
and she had me when she was 22 .
maybe you should talk to chuck about this .
he went through something very similar .
i &apos;m not ready to discuss this with anyone but you .
do you think this will be enough for the private investigator
to find her ?
yeah , it &apos;s worth a call .
single malt for breakfast ?
takes the edge off the coke .
i &apos;m gonna go make that call .
is there a problem ?
with raina , no .
but when you &apos;re ready to talk about whatever &apos;s up with you ,
let me know .
ah , the warm greeting of a friendship off the tracks .
come on , vanessa . i &apos;m--i &apos;m making an effort here .
apologies for being thrown by your sunny attitude .
you &apos;ve made it pretty clear that you &apos;re done with me .
i know i have , i know i have , but i was with my dad today ,
and i swung by veselka .
listen , i &apos;m right by campus . you wanna grab some coffee ?
so all my heartfelt attempts to save our friendship
had no impact , but the aroma of cheese and dough
turned you instantly sentimental ?
they do say smell is the sense most associated with memory .
well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m heading to school now , but i have class .
i could do drinks later tonight . hey , what are you
doing by n.y.u. ? don &apos;t you have off fridays ?
yeah , i do , but i got this writing job down here ,
uh , and then i realized it was a conflict of interest ,
so i quit , and , uh , now i--
well , why don &apos;t i explain everything to you tonight ?
okay . i &apos;ll , um , i &apos;ll see you then .
all right , good .
oh , hello , darling .
how are you ?
oh , i &apos;m fine . fine . so is someone else bringing the items
so is someone else bringing the items for the gift bags ?
i &apos;m so sorry , lily .
helping out was a lovely thought ,
but with the party
for the breast cancer research foundation being tonight ,
we felt it would just be easier
to do the gift bags at blaine &apos;s during prep .
well , i &apos;m disappointed , of course .
but the success of the event is the , uh , priority .
would you mind asking vanya to send over the food ?
i would hate for it to go to waste .
you know how the trumps love their tea sandwiches .
of course . ahem .
i &apos;m fine , really .
hey ! where are they going with those scones ?
uh , my guess is blaine trump &apos;s .
i think your mother may have underestimated
the impact of her sentence on her social standing .
the only thing thicker than blood is the ink on &quot; page six . &quot;
where &apos;s raina ?
she went back to her hotel .
i think your whole , uh , howard hughes routine
is starting to freak her out a little bit .
it &apos;s actually starting to freak me out , too , man .
talk to me .
i saw what you two were looking at this morning--
the tattered box , old photographs .
is raina looking for her mother ?
it &apos;s a mistake . you have to stop her .
look , man , i know what happened with your mom was painful .
but at least you got some answers .
raina deserves the same , and she can handle it .
you don &apos;t know that .
raina &apos;s been away at college ,
living a high @-@ profile life
which anyone could follow online .
if her mother wanted to get in touch with her ,
she would have done it by now . raina just lost her father .
do you really think she &apos;s ready to be rejected
by her mother all over again ?
i &apos;ll talk to her .
andrew , it &apos;s chuck bass .
i need you to find out everything you can
about the fire at the kinberg building .
i need to know
was avery thorpe there that night ?
i was so focused
on getting the perfect outfit that i didn &apos;t realize
it was freezing outside .
will you go get me a cardigan from upstairs ?
is everything okay ?
that was lucien , my royal advisor .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve been found out .
my parents have been informed ,
and lucien &apos;s on a plane now to escort me back to paris .
i don &apos;t understand .
just because you wanted a weekend away in new york ?
the truth is , i &apos;m here to see you .
i &apos;ve mentioned you many times since the summer ,
but my parents don &apos;t approve .
you are a commoner .
well , have they have seen princess stephanie &apos;s husbands ?
i &apos;m not a circus performer .
you &apos;re anything but common .
but the royal birthright has many strings attached .
when my advisor discovered i was in new york ,
he hired one of your friends to follow me .
i will see to it personally that penelope is deported
to a desperate third world country ,
preferably someplace with sharia law .
it was a man . he saw us at veselka .
dan humphrey ?
he--he wouldn &apos;t do that .
lucien probably made him a very good offer .
i was a fool to think
i &apos;d be allowed to follow my heart ,
even if only for a few days .
go back to your hotel and put on your suit .
i know who can fix this .
hey .
meet me at paul smith in half an hour .
you know why , and you should be ashamed of yourself .
how did you find out ?
i always find out . just be there .
charlie may be new to the city ,
but apparently she already knows how to get around .
who needs a map when you can just follow the cheater ?
blair , i swear i had no idea .
some magazine editor called me out of the blue
to hire me to write an article on your prince ,
and i backed out the minute i knew he was with you .
oh , you should have been suspicious the minute
someone wanted to pay you for your writing .
that wasn &apos;t an editor . it was one of louis &apos; royal handlers ,
and your desperate need for literary validation
cost me the greatest date of my life .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
i know you are , and that is why i &apos;m giving you the opportunity
to make this right .
louis told his handler , lucien ,
that he came to new york for a charity event tonight ,
and lucien doesn &apos;t believe him , so when he comes
to pick louis up from the party to take him to the airport .
we are going to convince him
that louis is a casual summer acquaintance ,
and you and i are madly in love .
why would he believe that ?
we are going to stage a private intimate moment
for lucien to stumble upon .
when he realizes that louis
was telling the truth and he has nothing to worry about ,
he &apos;ll go back to paris , leaving louis behind for me .
no way .
i thought you were my friend .
i am , which is why i &apos;m going to point out to you
what a bad idea this is .
for starters ,
serena &apos;s gonna be at this party .
she &apos;s staying with lily tonight .
fine , then everyone else in the world will be at this party .
we &apos;d have to tell serena about the plan .
absolutely not . you and i faking a kiss--
do you really wanna have that conversation with serena ?
can &apos;t be half as painful as this one .
think ahead , humphrey .
what if serena tells chuck ,
who , though up till now ,
quiet about our misbegotten make @-@ out ,
decides to speak up in the face of this latest insult ?
when you bring chuck into it , you &apos;re far more convincing .
okay , fine . you &apos;re paying for the tie .
what about &quot; it &apos;s a wonderful life &quot; ?
that &apos;ll cheer mom up .
no , no , she &apos;s in a dark place .
she has to work out her issues
with &quot; the godfather &quot; or &quot; taxi driver . &quot;
what about &quot; intolerance &quot; ?
that pretty much sums up this situation .
i was hoping to find
one sympathetic pink party planner
to advocate on your mom &apos;s behalf ,
get the party moved here from the trumps&apos;
so she could be a part of it .
you know , i might live on the upper east side ,
but i have no pull here .
now if the pink party was at cbgb &apos;s ...
i hate to break it to you ,
but cbgb &apos;s is a clothing store now .
you know , now that i think about it , there is a way
we could get the party moved . all you &apos;d have to do
is make a slight moral compromise .
eric , i know what you &apos;re talking about . i &apos;m not doing that .
not doing what ?
bubbles mac intosh , the co @-@ chair ,
tried to kiss serena in the ladies &apos; bathroom
at the pink party last year .
using that information would be crossing a line .
i wouldn &apos;t ask you to do that .
&#91; 这个是丹 没错吧
what if i was willing to cross that line ?
i want the party moved more than anyone ,
but it &apos;s not worth resorting to blackmail .
yeah . y @-@ you &apos;re probably right .
so , &quot; psycho &quot; or &quot; silence of the lambs &quot; ?
all right , make the call .
where are you guys heading ?
nate told me what you said ,
but i got a call from my p.i. ,
and he thinks he may have found my mother .
it turns out she wasn &apos;t trying very hard to hide .
in fact , she-- she lives in jersey ,
same name , right age .
i have an address for her .
i have to at least talk to her .
have you figured out what you might say to this woman ?
do you want me to come along ?
i know we &apos;ve been on opposing teams for a while ,
but ... i &apos;ve been through this .
maybe i could be helpful .
actually ...
yeah .
i &apos;d appreciate that .
i really hope it &apos;s my mom , chuck .
me , too .
louis is going to store his suitcase
in blaine trump &apos;s butler &apos;s pantry .
when lucien arrives , you and i will rendezvous there .
okay , i need to get going . you clear on the plan ?
uh , yeah , i think i &apos;ll be fine once i figure out
what a butler &apos;s pantry is .
you &apos;re a cater waiter .
you know exactly what a butler &apos;s pantry is .
where is my cell phone ?
o.m.g. they moved the pink party .
who moves a party ?
it &apos;s not who that should concern you .
it &apos;s where--lily &apos;s .
so that &apos;s it , then , right ?
no . the plan is still on .
in front of my dad , lily , serena ?
not in front of-- under the nose of .
we just need to be careful .
i &apos;m gonna call louis and tell him it &apos;s a go .
meet you there . screw this up , it &apos;s your head .
sorry , lonely boy , but it looks like this is going to be
a &quot; surrender the pink &quot; party for you .
lily . hi .
check out the diamonds on that lady .
they &apos;re almost as big as my face .
a gift from her husband--
&quot; sorry i slept with the au pair &quot; earrings .
have you seen dan and blair ?
no , and what do we do when they get here ?
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re gonna be holding hands in front of everyone .
oh , the thrill of a secret affair is the sneaking around .
trust me , they won &apos;t be able to resist
slipping away for a moment together .
and when we see them slip away ?
you follow them , record what you see ,
and send it to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
their secret ends tonight .
just make sure to text me once lucien arrives .
of course . thank you for this , blair .
i just wish you didn &apos;t have to go to these lengths
for me to stay .
it is saying a lot that i have to kiss dan humphrey
to protect you .
you &apos;re going to kiss him ?
don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s just a friend . i &apos;ll go up first .
i can &apos;t believe the ladies agreed to move the party .
after the frosty treatment i got from anne this afternoon ,
i was sure it was just me and my ankle monitor until fall .
i can &apos;t believe we pulled this off .
thank you so much for helping .
oh , no , don &apos;t thank me . thank bubbles .
as if we &apos;d want to be associated with a criminal .
she &apos;s an embarrassment .
we all agreed she &apos;s not to be
in any photos from the event .
okay , blair , is it jason simos ?
he &apos;s my boyfriend , jessica .
a handy at greenhouse doesn &apos;t make him your boyfriend .
maybe serena knows who blair &apos;s secret boyfriend is .
no , but the curiosity is killing me .
okay , i &apos;ll tell you .
not you . scatter .
20 paces minimum . no overhears .
i can &apos;t wait to see the look on their faces
when they find out it &apos;s the prince .
you are not to breathe a word of this .
normally , you &apos;d have to sign a nondisclosure agreement .
i &apos;m only grandfathering you in because of serena .
that him right over there ?
don &apos;t understand why you guys are ignoring each other .
that &apos;s because you &apos;re from florida .
oh , hey , it &apos;s dan .
with a really nice tie , too .
blair , did you know he was coming ?
i &apos;m sorry . i stopped listening
as soon as i heard the word &quot; dan . &quot; excuse me .
i can &apos;t believe it . she just lied to my face ,
even after i gave her the opportunity to tell me .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m dating dan
or wanna get back together with him ,
but the fact that the two of them have been hiding this from me ,
and she &apos;s supposed to be my best friend ?
it didn &apos;t seem like she was lying .
what if she really is with the prince ?
then she won &apos;t mind it if you flirt with dan .
maybe this was a mistake .
look , if you &apos;re not ready , we don &apos;t have to do this .
we can leave right now .
i &apos;ll handle it from here , okay ? you jump in when you &apos;re ready .
excuse me .
hi . may i take your order ?
actually , we &apos;re here to see you .
is your name avery trpe ?
i &apos;m sorry . do i know you ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to find out .
my name is raina , and i think you may be my--my mother .
i &apos;m sorry , sweheart , but that &apos;s not possible .
i know it &apos;s not easy to acknowledge these things
when you &apos;re put on the spot .
if you don &apos;t wanna be bothered , we can go .
i &apos;ve never had a child .
it &apos;s not that i didn &apos;t want one . just wasn &apos;t in god &apos;s plan .
i &apos;m so sorry , but i &apos;m not the woman you &apos;re looking for .
you were right .
it was a mistake to look .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , my mother is dead .
no , no , don &apos;n&apos;let sarah palin ruin it for you .
alaska is amazing .
i don &apos;t know , but between &quot; into the wild &quot;
and that werner herzog movie with the grizzly ,
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s for me .
excuse me . this is dan humphrey , serena &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend ,
which makes him off @-@ limits to you ,
and you should know better . certain people might see you ,
misunderstand , and think the two of you are here together .
i need to speak to you about your behavior , privately .
what do you do when cornered by a bear ?
uh , go fetal . cover your neck .
for someone who &apos;s just a friend , you sure are good
at choreographing reasons for us to kiss .
oh , it &apos;s because i &apos;m willing to suffer for love .
whatever you say , just no getting hands @-@ y .
thank you . oh , anne , there you are .
i just wanted to say thank you so much
for having the party moved here so that i could attend .
oh , please , lily . at least i was quiet in my humiliation .
i didn &apos;t blackmail people
and force them to come to my home .
she had nothing to do with it , anne . it &apos;s all my doing .
i have to say , i &apos;m surprised . i thought we were friends .
why ? you don &apos;t know how to be a friend .
you shut me out when i called off my divorce to the captain .
there &apos;s not a woman in this room
who didn &apos;t take some pleasure in your downfall , myself included .
so enjoy the party , lily . this will be your last .
oh , and you may wanna adjust your dress .
your monitor &apos;s showing .
i &apos;m so sorry , lily . are you okay ?
when lucien walked in to get the bag ,
i saw the look on his face . he totally bought it .
you &apos;re very convincing .
thanks , i guess .
blair waldorf and dan humphrey ? this is even better
than my parents &apos; divorce . please tell me it &apos;s true .
yes , it &apos;s true . dan is my mystery date ,
and we couldn &apos;t be happier .
now we have to find serena and explain this .
hey , what &apos;s all the commotion about ?
everyone finally found out about dan and blair .
but it isn &apos;t true . they &apos;re just putting on an act to protect me .
maybe that &apos;s what she told you ,
but they &apos;ve been secretly seeing each other for months .
you shouldn &apos;t be surprised . she lied to you in paris , too .
i &apos;m sorry .
serena , wait . i can explain .
i &apos;ll be right back .
lily may be wearing her dancing shoes ,
but it looks like she &apos;s about to make a run for it .
hey , i &apos;m headed over to raina &apos;s . i just don &apos;t want her
to be alone tonight . i know you disagree ,
but i think she should keep looking for her mom .
she looked . it wasn &apos;t her . give it up already .
so the first lead didn &apos;t pan out .
she has to stop .
russell &apos;s parting gift to me was a story about my father .
you remember how i told you my dad was responsible
for that fire in his old building ?
russell owned it , too . they were partners .
he says his wife was there that night ,
and she died in the fire .
how do you know he &apos;s even telling the truth ?
i don &apos;t , but today when that woman wasn &apos;t raina &apos;s mother ,
i realized how desperately i wanted her to be .
so maybe i do believe it .
what are you gonna do ?
try to find out the truth .
serena , that video wasn &apos;t real .
i mean , we did--we did kiss , but it was staged .
okay , even if i did believe you , what about the other time
you guys kissed ? was that for louis , too ?
uh ... it meant nothing . it was like kissing my brother ,
if i have one .
like kissing your brother .
just made me realize that i wanna be with chuck .
i don &apos;t understand .
how did you end up in a kiss in the first place--any kiss ?
we both were alone in the city over christmas break .
and we ran into each other at the movies .
and then it kept happening after the break ,
only we started making plans to meet .
and even worse , enjoying it .
but you guys are my two closest friends .
why couldn &apos;t you just tell me that ?
i was hoping it would go away .
i was humiliated ,
which is why we kissed .
to make sure nothing else was going on to complicate us
or--or hurt you .
and ?
biggest regret of my life .
i mean , that &apos;s a--come on . that &apos;s a little bit an overstatement ,
but , yeah , it was not a good kiss .
so you guys have been lying to me and sneaking around
for months so that you can hang out as friends ?
exactly . friends .
yeah , i swear . just--yeah , friends .
well , i &apos;m really glad you two found each other
cause you sure lost me .
i have to go .
i &apos;m really sorry , s.
i ... guess i was in denial .
i didn &apos;t want to admit
that i &apos;d begun to understand humphrey appeal .
the only appeal dan ever had to you was that he was mine .
you would see it that way ,
because it &apos;s always about you , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m sorry to break it to you ,
but dan and i have a real connection .
we did things like visit the dia
and debate chabrol versus rohmer--
things that we could never do with you .
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sure you and dan had a really deep connection ,
that is until a prince came along .
of course , because that would be an even bigger threat to you .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you prefer when you are the one in the spotlight ,
but it &apos;s my turn now .
you can have a taste of what it &apos;s like
to be in my shadow for once .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , my prince awaits .
lily humphrey ?
ma &apos;am , you &apos;re violating the terms
of your incarceration by being down here .
ah , there you are . it took you long enough .
i &apos;m sorry ?
my apartment is teeming with women throwing back
champagne cocktails and toasting my misfortune .
honestly , it &apos;s worth risking an orange jumpsuit
not to have to face another botox bitch
in a pink cocktail dress .
this is my way of saying could you please do me a favor ?
i &apos;m here to arrest you .
yes , well , there was some confusion about the perimeter--
whether the alarm was for the apartment or the building .
in the meantime , there have been
horrible noise complaints from the neighbors .
i really think we should do something about that .
hey . have you seen louis ?
ah , the prince . i can &apos;t find him anywhere .
i don &apos;t know who that is .
have you seen my mother ?
hey ! all right , everybody . the party is over .
time to grab your judith leibers , ladies .
looks like the upper east side &apos;s smoothest criminal
has just given you the boot .
i am so sorry about tonight .
don &apos;t be . first of all , it was so sweet of you
to move the party for me .
and i needed to hear those things that anne said .
the fact is , maybe i could use a little time
to reflect on my actions and what got me here .
there is nothing more appealing to me
than staying home with you , watching a hundred movies
and never seeing those women again .
well , good , because i can promise you
that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do for at least the next nine months .
or six , for good behavior .
i totally understand if you don &apos;t want to see me ,
but i just wanted to tell you in person
how sorry i am for recording you .
it was probably for the best .
i saw the kiss .
i think you really like her .
yeah , you might be right .
i &apos;ve been trying to convince myself
that i could handle being friends with her ,
but i realize tonight that i can &apos;t .
i know from experience what it &apos;s like
to watch from the outside as someone else
walks away with the person you want .
yeah , i just never thought that the person i want
would be blair waldorf .
neither did serena .
she just thought some girl named vanessa
was messing with her .
wait . vanessa told her about the kiss ? not chuck ?
she left her a message ,
saying she overheard you and blair talking about it ?
all right .
i &apos;ve taken up enough of your time tonight .
so thanks for hearing me out .
no , actually , you know what ? hold on . do you , uh ...
did you wanna stay ?
thanks for coming back for me .
i just stood up in front of everyone who matters
in new york society and said i was dating dan humphrey .
i committed social suicide for you .
but serena told me you &apos;ve been having an affair with him .
she misunderstood .
we &apos;ve been friends . that &apos;s all .
you have to believe me .
you &apos;re the only man in my life now ,
the only man i want there , anyway .
i believe you .
you do ?
but being together means going against my family ,
and if i &apos;m going to take a stand ,
i need to know for certain that you feel as i do .
i do .
are you ready to go public , my family be damned ?
i &apos;m ready if you are .
there they are !
you can never really know someone
until you walk a mile in their shoes .
salut , jean michel .
it &apos;s serena van der woodsen
from paris last summer .
i was with blair and louis tonight ,
and it made me think about you , wanna call you and catch up ,
and , you know , see what &apos;s going on in your life and louis &apos; .
at first , it might not seem like the most natural fit ...
what &apos;s in there ?
that used to be my sister &apos;s room and then it was a nursery ,
then it was vanessa &apos;s room , and now it is my office .
it &apos;s a pretty versatile living space .
uh , you know , check it out if you want , but i gotta get this .
hi . i figured if you were beat , we could just hang here .
actually , i was planning on standing you up .
i know you told serena about the kiss with blair .
i was gonna tell you tonight to explain why i left the message .
i wasn &apos;t trying to hurt you .
i honestly thought something must be very wrong
if you were kissing blair waldorf .
and since you weren &apos;t talking to me ,
i thought you might listen to serena .
vanessa , i know we &apos;ve been friends since we were little ,
and we both like pierogies , and my dad really misses you ,
but just to be clear ,
so there &apos;s no misunderstanding down the road ,
we are not friends anymore .
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , it is .
but walk around in those shoes long enough ,
and you &apos;ll discover you just might like it .
your dad gave me these security tapes
after the kinberg building burned down
and asked me to lock them away .
this one &apos;s from 8 : 00 p.m. the night of the fire .
what &apos;s on it ?
bart , having an argument with a woman--avery thorpe .
then avery goes into the building alone ,
and bart hurries away .
okay . so ?
moments later , the building goes up in flames ,
and avery thorpe is never heard from again .
just don &apos;t get too comfortable , kids ,
because you never know
when the other shoe is going to drop .
