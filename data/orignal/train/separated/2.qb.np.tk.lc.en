第五季第九集
we need money .
put simply , we need more clients .
thank you .
do you want to hear this or not ?
we were all hurt by our slow rollout .
we didn &apos;t have an office ; what were we supposed to do ?
i &apos;m not saying that there &apos;s not a reason .
i &apos;m sick of being ... - what i am saying is that we need more money ...
of course we do , but we don &apos;t have any ...
and we need clients ...
okay . okay ! okay .
we &apos;re in the situation we &apos;re in .
so what do we do about it ?
okay ! okay .
we &apos;re swamped .
we have lost half of our top litigators .
yeah , and good riddance .
and ... and our caseload has increased .
we have received continuances on eight of our 12 open cases ,
but we need to start hiring soon .
we also need to get our clients back .
losing chumhum is still an embarrassment .
yeah , but first things first .
we need four associates with trial experience .
we also need to deal with florrick &amp; agos .
no , we can &apos;t keep obsessing about ...
no , no , no .
we need to move on .
i have a great idea about ... - wait , listen .
we do both .
no &quot; first things first . &quot;
we expedite hiring and work on client loss .
david , i want you to form a client retention working group .
bring our clients back home .
and , diane ...
howard , why don &apos;t you take over the status meeting ?
kalinda .
we need new clients .
we can &apos;t keep looking to lockhart / gardner .
how about a christmas party ?
how about what ?
well , we had a slow rollout
because we didn &apos;t have office space ,
and now we have office space , so let &apos;s have a real rollout .
mrs. florrick , you have a phone call .
i &apos;ll be right back .
it &apos;s someone who said he was an old client of yours ,
a zayeed shaheed .
zayeed , yes , thanks .
zayeed ?
yes , it &apos;s alicia .
how are you doing ?
uh , fine , thank you .
look , alicia , i hate to be blunt ,
but i could use your help with a problem right now .
okay , uh , what is it ?
a university colleague is trying to get a job as a cia analyst ,
and the fbi is here asking some questions about him
for a background check .
okay , where &apos;s here ?
my home . why ?
uh , no reason .
keep going .
well , their questions are getting more personal ,
and i &apos;m worried about getting this person in trouble .
a @-@ are you still on campus ?
i am ... 2143 burnham .
okay , i &apos;m coming to you .
ask the federal agents politely
to wait until i get there for more questioning , okay ?
okay .
robyn , i need you as a witness .
new client ?
old .
with money ?
some .
lauralee gregg .
tulane undergrad , yale school of law ,
ten years at mckinley , barrett and skiff .
no .
may i ask why ?
ten years at mckinley and barrett ,
and she was second chair on her last case .
i wouldn &apos;t read anything into that .
i do .
david benjamin goldbaum .
georgetown undergrad , stanford ...
next .
will , if you don &apos;t snap him up ,
fisher &amp; chung will .
that makes sense .
uh , david &apos;s a great litigator .
we lost to him in court .
no , we settled with him .
yeah , for $ 2 million .
which should have been four .
so you &apos;re rejecting him because he wasn &apos;t hard enough on you ?
yes .
who was that ?
it &apos;s no one , not appropriate .
beth , we &apos;re not who we were .
what was inappropriate two months ago
is appropriate now .
damian boyle .
he &apos;s been in private practice for 15 years ... criminal law .
his clients are , well , not your clients .
pro bono ?
no , very not pro bono .
antonio pola last year ,
sal calastana .
where &apos;s his photo ?
he doesn &apos;t like being photographed .
he &apos;s looking for a home .
some of his top clients are in prison now
and he needs to make ends meet .
the problem is , nobody wants him .
will ,
just because someone is wrong for us doesn &apos;t make him right .
let &apos;s see him .
what can it hurt ?
alicia , thanks for doing this .
no problem ... are they still here ?
yes , they decided to stay .
they &apos;re a little impatient .
play it sweet .
after we &apos;re introduced , ask them if you can record
the interview for your records .
thanks for waiting .
call it a lawyerly overabundance of caution .
so , this is about mr. shaheed &apos;s colleague ?
yes , ezzedine kalb .
we just had a few questions .
now , mr. kalb was in milwaukee recently with you ?
do you mind if i tape this ?
this interview ?
why ?
oh , for our records . we do it all the time .
i &apos;m , i &apos;m bad at taking notes .
we &apos;d rather this be off the record .
oh , it will be .
i just need a , a correct record for my notes .
robyn &apos;s a stickler for detail .
certainly , if it &apos;s for your notes .
you were in milwaukee with your colleague two weeks ago ?
yes .
and why were you there ?
for a conference
on educational differences in developing countries .
i see .
and did you spend the whole time with mr. kalb ?
no , not the whole time .
and what about the afternoon of october 15 ?
the 15th this year ?
yes .
the day of the explosion at the milwaukee food festival ?
yes , i think that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m gonna ask my client
to stop answering questions at this time .
why ?
because i don &apos;t think this interview
is what you &apos;re implying .
what do you think we &apos;re implying ?
zayeed , you can ask them to leave now .
no , he can &apos;t .
this is a warrant
for computers , files , ipads , smartphones , and papers
in the possession of your client .
zayeed ,
i need you to step out of the room for a second .
robyn , can you take him ?
actually , agent anderson , will you accompany them
to make sure no materials subject to the warrant are disturbed ?
it &apos;s the color of my skin .
they think i planted a bomb .
zayeed , were you anywhere near the bomb site ?
no , i barely left the hotel .
what hotel ?
the sheraton .
where were you at the time of the explosion ?
in my room .
what are they going to find on your computer , zayeed ?
nothing ... my book , my lectures .
no porn , no foreign financing ?
anything that needs to be explained .
no .
tell us now .
we &apos;ll find out later .
look , the subject matter of my book is jihad--
not violent jihad ... spiritual jihad ,
but the materials can be open to misinterpretation .
okay , stay out of their way
and don &apos;t answer any more questions .
where are you going ?
to quash the warrant .
your honor !
why are you yelling ?
i &apos;m not yelling .
i &apos;m passionate , your honor .
the abuse here is passion @-@ inducing .
passion @-@ inducing ?
well , goodness , let &apos;s not have our passion induced .
so let me get this straight ...
you want me to bar him from representing him .
that &apos;s your requested remedy ?
yes , your honor .
damian boyle is not just representing
the gerraghty crime family .
he &apos;s a member of the gerraghty crime family .
why ,
because i &apos;m irish ?
that has nothing to do with it .
or is it because i &apos;ve beaten you three times in court ?
you haven &apos;t beaten me .
your honor ,
i am a simple small @-@ town lawyer ...
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t you stand up ?
my apologies .
your honor , i am a simple small @-@ town lawyer
who &apos;s come to the big city to defend an honest businessman ,
and i &apos;ve beaten the ausa three times ,
in three previous court hearings ,
and that &apos;s why he wants to bar me
from representing an innocent man , but ...
correct me if i &apos;m wrong ... this is america ,
and i &apos;ll be damned if i &apos;m going to let this man tread on my rights ,
your rights , or anyone &apos;s rights .
thank you , that was a beautiful speech .
you &apos;re welcome . i know we work in a cynical business ,
your honor , but i believe it .
your honor , we have federal wiretaps with mr. boyle
conducting business for the gerraghty crime syndicate .
oh , really ?
well , let &apos;s hear it .
mr. boyle , please ,
let me do my job .
let &apos;s hear it .
the taps are sealed , your honor ,
part of a wider investigation .
yeah , keep , keep laughing , mr. boyle ,
keep ... - your honor , come on ,
we &apos;re coming after you with wiretaps !
what have i done to this man , really ,
except beat him fair and square ?
your honor , this warrant should be quashed .
it &apos;s racial profiling , pure and simple .
the fbi doesn &apos;t racially profile .
he was a dark @-@ skinned man visiting milwaukee .
a dark @-@ skinned man advocating jihad .
not the jihad of violent overthrow .
your honor ,
we don &apos;t need to prove that zayeed shaheed planted a bomb .
we only need to prove ...
that there is more evidence
than mr. shaheed &apos;s name and the color of his skin .
my client was nowhere near the crime scene
before or after the bombing .
he was in room 546 ...
your honor , this picture was taken
two minutes prior to the fateful explosion ,
and as you can see ,
that is zayeed shaheed passing the garbage can
where the bomb was placed ,
but i would love to hear more about mr. shaheed
being in room 546 .
uh , if there are legal papers anywhere on your person ,
i suggest you keep walking .
will gardner .
i &apos;m a partner at l.g.
lockhart / gardner .
oh , congratulations .
what do you want ?
i saw you in court today .
can i buy you a drink ?
another black , please .
what was that ?
jewish joke .
has he heard the one about the irish pilot ?
he has , yeah .
so , you drinking or what ?
another black .
you &apos;re gonna lose the case against the government .
it happens .
the judges are just human .
they don &apos;t mind pissing off an individual lawyer .
they do think twice when it &apos;s a whole law firm .
what &apos;s the name of your firm again , pal ?
lockhart / gardner .
hmm , never heard of it .
what firms have you heard of ?
you still looking for a home ?
why , you offering me a job ?
i might be .
there are friends ... i have
that i defend no matter what .
do they have money ?
then that &apos;s not a problem .
i don &apos;t work sundays .
why not ?
what do you care ?
okay .
you work twice as hard during the week , i &apos;m fine with that .
okay .
let me think about it .
that &apos;s not me , i swear .
you were in your hotel room taking a nap ?
yes , i was in my hotel room .
at 3 : 00 in the afternoon ?
i was tired .
and no one saw you there .
i didn &apos;t have anything to do with this .
i &apos;m a teacher , that &apos;s all .
alicia .
is it a surveillance camera ?
no , see up here ...
this blur ?
yeah .
i thought that was a thumb from someone using their iphone .
a tourist photo ?
how &apos;d it get to the fbi ?
scabbit ... the web site .
there &apos;s a thread on the milwaukee bombing ,
and everybody &apos;s talking about who might have done it ,
like the boston marathon.there.
the fbi is getting their photos from scabbit ?
yeah , it looks like it .
and one other thing ... if the feds are using scabbit ,
then zayeed is in real trouble .
why ?
well , the people on here think he did it ,
and they say they can prove it .
and peter &apos;s been so sweet to me . he sent a car for me .
a town car .
oh , being the governor &apos;s mom has certain advantages ,
but it &apos;s not just , uh ...
mm . would you excuse me for just one minute ?
jackie . what a surprise .
mr. gold .
rachel !
oh , you two know each other .
yes , i clerked for her husband a zillion years ago .
nice to see you , jackie .
rachel was the judge &apos;s favorite clerk .
well , hats off for not playing that card with peter .
with peter ?
yes . rachel &apos;s the new supreme court candidate
to replace diane lockhart .
oh , well , then congratulations are certainly in order .
the judge would be proud .
well , thank you , jackie . that means the world . yes , well ,
i &apos;ll let you two get back to your meeting .
mr. gold , could i speak to you for just one minute ?
sure .
tell her no .
she &apos;s not getting the supreme court seat .
really ? why is that ?
let her down gently .
jackie .
jackie , no .
you get to decorate the offices
and throw the inaugural ball , but this ,
this is my prerogative .
this is peter &apos;s prerogative .
whatever grudge you have , you need to suck it up .
good seeing you .
that &apos;s not him .
then go to the fbi with a proffer .
explain the jihad stuff .
show the feds that &apos;s not him .
there &apos;s another photo . someone just uploaded it .
what ? ! of zayeed ?
you &apos;re kidding .
&quot; zayeed shaheed fleeing the bombing .
&quot; police should do something .
signed sharkbit678 . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t even make sense . he &apos;s skating .
it doesn &apos;t look like him , either .
ah , &quot; that &apos;s not zayeed . that &apos;s his accomplice .
&quot; see the walkie @-@ talkie in his back pocket ?
laoshunt93 . &quot;
oh , my god , this stuff is crazy .
what &apos;s crazy is the fbi using it .
sue for an injunction .
what ?
against scabbit .
force them to take down the thread .
what &apos;ll that do ?
if the fbi is using
crowd @-@ sourcing for its investigation , cut off the supply .
good . i &apos;ll go to court .
i &apos;ll make the proffer .
we didn &apos;t vote on this .
yes , but we discussed hiring a new partner .
at a meeting you left .
yes , but i got a sense of the room ,
and the sense was that we wanted to hire somebody .
wait , what is this &quot; sense of the room &quot; crap ?
when did that start replacing votes ?
who is this guy anyway ?
damian boyle . he &apos;s a top litigator .
if we didn &apos;t act , he would &apos;ve been snapped up .
i &apos;ve not even heard of him .
he &apos;s a mob lawyer .
no , he &apos;s not .
will . will , that is not true .
what &apos;s not true ?
what you just said .
he wouldn &apos;t have been snapped up .
our headhunter told us the exact opposite .
oh , so the truth comes out .
look ... decisions sometimes need to be made on the fly .
in my opinion , this was one of them .
if you disagree ... sanction me . okay .
excuse me .
is it always like this ?
no . the last few weeks .
what &apos;s this ? this song .
i have no idea .
oh , don &apos;t you hate that ,
when a song gets ... stuck in your head ?
more than anything .
you have very pretty eyes .
no , i don &apos;t .
no , you do , you do . and i know from pretty eyes .
damian , you &apos;re on the client @-@ retention working group .
yeah . hold on .
will .
you can &apos;t be doing this .
doing what ?
making this firm grow ?
making decisions before they get argued to death ?
this was a decision that could &apos;ve used some arguing .
you know how this works , diane .
david lee argues for a relative .
you say no . it &apos;s referred to a subcommittee .
they take three weeks , and come back with a stalemate .
you don &apos;t know that .
i do know that .
at a certain point , someone just needs to decide .
we don &apos;t have the luxury of being a deadlocked government .
well , then welcome to your decision .
because that &apos;s what happens when one person decides .
you can always call me there . i &apos;m just saying .
what did he say ?
he &apos;s sick of debate .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t give a damn ...
this isn &apos;t communist russia .
well , what do you want me to do ?
sanction will , and get this new lawyer kicked out .
david , a month ago you wanted me kicked out .
yeah , so ? that was a month ago .
i have two @-@ thirds of the partners
ready to dump him .
will ?
no . him .
mr. mob .
they want to know if you &apos;re on board .
hello again .
hello again to you , your honor .
i hear you started your own law firm .
uh , y @-@ yes , your honor . three weeks in .
congratulations . what brings you to brighten my courtroom today ?
an injunction , your honor , against scabbit ,
a social news and entertainment site
where users post or link to content .
i see we seem to be alone here today .
yes , your honor .
scabbit has ignored our subpoenas .
we believe this is brinkmanship through absence .
okay , i &apos;m not gonna grant an injunction against
a whole web site without letting them air their arguments .
we &apos;re not asking for an injunction
against the whole web site , your honor ,
just one thread on that site :
a thread that disparages our client .
okay . uh , give me all the relevant evidence , and i will rule .
and , of course , it &apos;s good seeing you again .
can you do me a favor ? next time , can you bring me back
something just a little more serious ,
i don &apos;t know , like a ... a grocery store robbery ?
definitely , your honor .
three ayes .
all opposed ?
four opposed .
are you an abstention , mr. boyle ?
what ?
are you abstaining ?
to what ?
whether we should negotiate with florrick @-@ agos
to share the ongoing chumhum privacy suit ?
this is the firm that stole your clients ?
yes .
and that &apos;s one of the ... clients they stole ?
yes , it &apos;s a top client .
$ 35 million a year in billables .
$ 35 million ?
why don &apos;t you try listening next time ?
and you want to negotiate with them ?
they stole $ 35 million a year from you ,
and you want to negotiate ?
just vote , okay ?
sure .
which way do i vote to get buggered ?
all right , i &apos;ll mark you down as an abstention .
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
yeah .
is this the client @-@ retention working group ?
yeah . you got a minute ?
yeah .
come on .
you .
what do you do here ?
doesn &apos;t matter . you &apos;re coming with me , all right ?
you , too . ditch the jackets .
what are you doing ?
working .
nah . you get lunch off . come on .
come on .
i &apos;m taking a legal field trip .
florrick @-@ agos &amp; associates .
no , mr. agos is at lunch right now .
may i take a message ?
wait , that might be him . wait .
how &apos;s it going ?
one second . no , that &apos;s not him .
right , everything . lamps , too .
excuse me , hello ?
hello . yes , we &apos;re here with the rental company .
they wanted us to swap out the furniture .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know anything about that .
yeah , well ,
we just got the call ourselves .
howard , call the office ,
and tell them we &apos;re on our way .
what ?
howard . call the office
and tell them we &apos;re on our way .
we &apos;ll be really quick . right ?
just let us know if we get in the way .
sure .
cheers , love .
oh , careful with those , now , guys .
all of it into the freight elevator .
被告 : 瞎掰网
it &apos;s gone .
the thread ?
yeah . &quot; due to legal injunction ,
this thread has been removed by the owners . &quot;
well , the law works ... even on the internet .
what ?
there &apos;s another thread ?
there &apos;s another thread .
it just popped up . &quot; bombing suspect still at large . &quot;
does it mention zayeed ?
this is whac @-@ a @-@ mole .
we get an injunction on one thread , and another one pops up .
we need to get scabbit in court .
well , the judge leans our way ; maybe they &apos;ll sanction him .
oh , yeah , the , uh , movers came ,
and they said they should have the furniture here in about an hour .
peter , i need you to get on the phone with one of the ...
you cannot let peter appoint rachel keyser .
give me a minute , nora .
he has already appointed her .
then tell him he made a mistake .
i thought you said she was the judge &apos;s favorite .
she was .
i will not have a woman who slept with my husband ,
and al ... almost ruined my family ,
be rewarded with a seat in my son &apos;s cabinet .
does peter know ?
i &apos;m sorry , jackie .
i understand why you &apos;re upset .
no . you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s true , i don &apos;t , but my hands are tied here .
peter has already reversed the appointment of one female candidate .
he can &apos;t do it again .
you don &apos;t want me to go to my son about this .
no , you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
but i don &apos;t think you want to , either .
that &apos;s dirty , eli .
no . no , it &apos;s not .
there is no political reason to dump this candidate ,
and i will not pretend there is to make things ...
emotionally easier .
how understanding of you .
jackie , i &apos;m sorry , but ...
all rise .
well , that injunction didn &apos;t work .
it appears so , your honor , and as you can see ,
a new thread has popped up that also disparages our client .
yes , that has a way of happening .
and as you can see , scabbit has again refused to appear in court .
uh , no . uh , we just got a message .
they are on their way with their new counsel .
so , let &apos;s give them a couple of moments .
so , uh , how is it going on your own ?
on my own ?
oh . my own law firm . mm .
bracing , your honor .
i remember my first year hanging the shingle .
oh , god , there &apos;s nothing scarier in the world .
yes , your honor .
oh , here &apos;s your opposition .
hello , your honor .
will gardner and damian boyle here representing
the interests of scabbit.com.
will gardner ? why is that ... ?
oh , yes .
you two used to be on the same side , didn &apos;t you ?
yes , your honor .
oh , well , that &apos;s awkward .
not at all , your honor .
scabbit has not adhered to the cease @-@ and @-@ desist order , your honor .
we have adhered , your honor .
as mrs. florrick is well aware ,
we &apos;ve taken down the thread
covered in the original complaint .
the thread has been renamed ,
not taken down . may i approach ?
oh , please .
as you can see here ,
the deleted &quot; milwaukee bomber &quot; thread
has been renamed , &quot; who bombed the milwaukee festival ? &quot;
that is not a renaming .
that is a spontaneous expression of scabbit &apos;s members .
we took down the thread . they introduced their own .
we can control our actions , your honor ,
but we can not and should not
control the actions of our members .
we are not asking them to control anyone but themselves .
we ask that they be forced to take down this new thread ...
you know , i agree with mrs. florrick .
you guys ... you &apos;re playing with semantics .
you &apos;re not going to the spirit of the law .
we ask that they take down this thread , your honor .
sure .
this is the ceo of scabbit.com.
uh , mr. essex , would you do the honor ?
yes .
it &apos;s gone . the thread &apos;s gone .
this is a game , uh ...
your honor , may i approach the bench ?
oh , come on down . it &apos;s a party .
this is a game of whac @-@ a @-@ mole , your honor .
there will be three more threads by this afternoon .
i have a question .
has anyone ever actually played whac @-@ a @-@ mole ?
or is it some metaphor we use mindlessly ?
oh , yes , i have , your honor .
navy pier .
it &apos;s really good .
helps get out your aggressions .
what &apos;s your name again ?
damian boyle .
in what part of ireland ?
oh , no , no . the accent &apos;s fake .
i &apos;m from queens .
the point is , your honor ,
we move that scabbit honor the spirit of your ruling
by deleting threads as they appear .
how ? i mean , how @-@ how @-@ how do we do that ?
scabbit employs moderators who ...
yes , mrs. florrick ?
uh , we @-@ we just , that , uh ...
your honor , we ask that chumhum ... excuse me ...
that scabbit issue an edict
to have those moderators prohibit postings
vilifying zayeed shaheed .
that is a prior restraint , your honor .
i &apos;m surprised mrs. florrick and mr. agos would even suggest it .
maybe that would work for chumhum ...
we are ready and able to delete any threads
ordered by the court , but it is unconstitutional
to restrain speech beforehand .
your honor ,
this is a game .
yes . whac @-@ a @-@ mole . we &apos;ve been over this .
we can &apos;t come in here every time a new post appears .
there &apos;s a new one .
see ? new thread &apos;s up already .
what &apos;s the title of it ?
&quot; milwaukee bomber part two . &quot;
would the court like it deleted ?
yes .
done .
your honor ... this is ridiculous .
yes .
unfortunately , it might be , but it &apos;s the law .
my cease @-@ and @-@ desist orders can not cover future infractions ,
only current , so , return with
objections to threads as they appear ,
and ... i will rule .
where did you get that ?
what ? oh , oh , this old thing .
oh , i don &apos;t know .
why ? do you like it ?
i liked it when it was on my desk .
oh , you have one , too ?
you &apos;re the world &apos;s number one mom ?
well , i have me moments .
you took the furniture from our offices .
so , this is what it &apos;s come down to ... high school pranks ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , my god .
i am calling for a vote to rescind the partnership
extended to damian boyle by will .
any debate ?
i kind of like the guy .
yeah , i say we give him a chance .
david , you &apos;re the one who called for this vote .
yeah . i changed my mind .
me , too .
and he brought us this internet thing . what &apos;s it called ?
scabbit .
yeah .
and he &apos;s a very funny guy .
howard , this is a law firm , not second city .
if the motion is to remove him , i &apos;d vote no .
hey . you were looking for me ?
what do you think of damian ?
mm , not much .
based on what ?
first impressions .
can you get me more than that ?
i can try . we didn &apos;t get a chance to vet him .
vet him now .
i sent sondra to get another card table .
who was that guy ?
damian boyle ?
lockhart / gardner &apos;s new rainmaker .
brass knuckles type .
why would lockhart / gardner represent scabbit ?
there can &apos;t be much money there .
it &apos;s a double @-@ bank shot .
they want chumhum to see us arguing against internet freedom .
so they can pull chumhum back .
yup .
any leads on our furniture ?
uh , no .
the surveillance cameras downstairs were broken .
we &apos;re having new furniture brought in this afternoon .
you want to get the cops involved ?
zayeed ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i just got fired .
what ? !
i went back to my office , and security barred my door .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s these threads .
they &apos;re saying incredible things .
they say i was at a madrasa in afghanistan .
they say i was at a terrorist training camp .
what ?
we &apos;ve been going at this wrong .
in a piecemeal way .
you have damages now .
defamation , your honor .
well , that &apos;s imaginative .
you two do know that i have other cases ?
we &apos;re asking for $ 400,000 in compensatory damages
and $ 8 million in punitive damages .
wow . $ 8 million . why not $ 60 ?
our client lost his job
and a lucrative book deal
due to the reckless behavior exhibited by scabbit .
there &apos;s no defamation .
section 230 of the communications decency act
specifically exempts hosts from the responsibility
of postings for their users .
right , you can &apos;t sue the city for building sidewalks
where protestors voice their freedom of speech .
yes . unless the offender is an employee of the scabbit web site .
you &apos;re fishing . she &apos;s fishing , your honor .
i wish i were , but we have a witness .
goody .
grant irvin .
scabbit screen name : &quot; lotion my feet . &quot;
&quot; lotion my feet &quot; ? really ?
yes . it &apos;s a joke .
and how long have you been active on scabbit , mr. irvin ?
from the beginning .
the very beginning . hi , darryl .
in fact , you &apos;re a ground floor poster ,
mr. irvin . what does that mean ?
it means i &apos;m ... pretty cool , pretty gansta .
oh , we are happy for you .
and , um , this is your comment
from two days ago ?
&quot; zayeed is a terrorist
&quot; trained in pakistan and sent to america undercover .
lotion my feet . &quot; ?
yes . that &apos;s me .
and how did you know this about zayeed ?
how did i know it ? i didn &apos;t . it &apos;s my opinion .
okay .
did you know he was born in detroit ?
no .
and isn &apos;t it true that in addition
to your ground floor status ,
you are a moderator on this site ?
yes .
and as a moderator , you monitor the topic threads ,
and shut down accounts of abusive users ?
yes .
and does scabbit reward you for these efforts ?
yeah . i have more pimp points than any other user .
pimp points ? what are those ?
like internet money . it gets you more prestige .
i have about as much influence as the founders .
nothing further .
so , you said , pimp points are like internet money ?
explain that to me .
users with the most visited threads are rewarded
with online icons that appear next to their names .
ah , i see .
and can you use these pimp points to buy things
like food or clothing ?
no .
your honor , quite simply ,
employees are compensated .
mr. feet was never compensated for his efforts .
employees are also supervised , your honor .
and we contend that the awarding of points indicates supervision .
points can not be awarded
if the moderators are not tracked and supervised .
yes . that &apos;s a nice pivot .
supervision is enough to establish
employment as regards section 230 .
just a , few more questions , your honor ?
go ahead .
mr. irvin , do you ... ?
you can call me &quot; mr. feet . &quot;
uh , no , thanks .
were you contacted by scabbit
before receiving your points and titles ?
by scabbit ? no .
any supervisor at scabbit ?
no .
in fact , do you know how pimp points are awarded ?
yeah . they &apos;re based on algorithm .
meaning , the computer decided the compensation ,
not a human ?
yes .
it &apos;s like words with friends rankings .
you reach a goal , and bam , here you go .
no more questions .
mrs. florrick , any thoughts ?
not at this time .
you should have turned it down .
jackie , hello .
i &apos;m sorry . what was that ?
i said , you should have turned it down .
now , it will be much more embarrassing when you bow out .
jackie , why don &apos;t you call my office ?
we &apos;ll sit down and talk .
no , thank you .
if this is about that ... confusion ...
is that what it was ... confusion ?
what , where to wear your panties ?
that was a long time ago .
i was 25 .
yes . and you should have slept
with a husband of someone with a shorter memory .
it was nice seeing you , jackie .
but i &apos;m not bowing out of anything .
then i &apos;ll tell your husband .
tell my husband what ?
that you had sex with my husband for two years
after you were married .
he &apos;s in the hospital with cancer .
that &apos;s too bad . it &apos;ll make it that much harder for him .
you are an awful women .
yes . i am .
bow out , or i &apos;ll tell your husband .
he already knows .
i don &apos;t believe you .
too bad .
ronald and i don &apos;t keep secrets from each other .
he &apos;s known for years .
so do your worst , jackie .
you were never important to the judge .
excuse me , i have to get to my lunch .
thanks for doing this .
it should only take a few minutes .
sure .
and , uh , what is &quot; this &quot; ?
um , it &apos;s the usual employment questions .
we like to keep this stuff on file .
oh ... you &apos;re the investigator .
yes .
are you good ?
i am .
i don &apos;t believe in women investigators .
you &apos;re just not ...
thorough enough .
good .
that will give me more time to work with the other partners .
birthdate ?
july 13 , 1971 .
may 5 , 1971 .
november 3 , 1972 .
and do you have a primary one ?
how long have you been in the states ?
15 years . how &apos; bout yourself ?
how long have you been in private practice ?
eight years .
any family ?
yeah .
who are they ?
five sisters in dublin .
four married , one in school .
my mother &apos;s in a home . father &apos;s dead .
he left her when i was eight .
i have authority issues .
and i really like the color purple .
so , uh , you ever been arrested ?
no comment .
hmm . actually , that &apos;s , uh ... that &apos;s not a possibility .
actually , it has to be .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
i need an answer .
or ... ?
or i will have to investigate .
and that way you won &apos;t get a chance
to put your arrests in perspective .
yeah , fair enough . um , last first or ...
if you want . yeah ?
before we , um ... a few things ,
i feel like i have a better perspective on the law
because i &apos;ve seen both sides of it .
save the speech for will and diane .
i just need the facts .
section 230 applies .
your supervision counters a clever argument ,
but the reward system is based on an algorithm .
therefore , scabbit posters cannot be classified as employees .
so there &apos;s no defamation .
your honor , we cannot be assured
that the posters are not , in fact , employees of scabbit .
we only have access to their online user names .
hold on .
we ask that scabbit release
the real names of the posters involved in defaming my client .
this is the only way we can determine
if the posters in question are not actually scabbit employees .
objection , your honor .
this is a mrs. florrick ploy .
really ?
really . revealing the identities of users would destroy scabbit .
still , it seems like a @-@ a fair request to me .
i mean , your argument is that the users
who defamed her client are not employees .
well , the only way she can tell that
is if she &apos;s given the actual names of the users .
can we ask for a gag order
to protect the identities of the posters ?
absolutely . come on . ask for anything you want .
unlike scabbit , we are not interested in defaming innocent people .
we just want the truth .
oh.well , try to accept your victory without gloating ,
mrs. florrick . please release the names to florrick &amp; agos
by the end of the day .
damian ?
yeah .
he was pretty forthcoming .
well , that &apos;s surprising .
he gave me three different birthdays .
only three ?
he did pass the illinois bar .
and he was in a d.u.i. a few months ago
in which he hit a streetlight .
it &apos;s not on his record ?
no . police decided not to prosecute ,
after he gave a donation to the police memorial fund .
was the donation for $ 18,000 ?
yeah .
howard lyman ran into a streetlight
and donated $ 18,000 to the police memorial fund to avoid a d.u.i.
he &apos;s using howard lyman &apos;s indiscretion .
yes .
okay .
i &apos;ll find out more .
this one &apos;s a little off , isn &apos;t he ?
yeah .
dangerous ?
no .
just off .
lockhart &amp; gardner dumped 180 names on us ,
and i cross @-@ referenced them with scabbit employees
and there were no hits .
damn , so ... what , we lost ?
well , there was one poster , dante pryor , who doesn &apos;t exist .
who ? what does that mean ?
it means ...
i have no idea .
but he &apos;s all over the web . his screen name is chubbysocks52 .
and he &apos;s on chumhum , facebook , twitter ,
foursquare , but i can &apos;t find him
through the dmv or utility companies .
okay . so what do we do ?
i have no idea .
180 users defamed zayeed .
179 i located , one i haven &apos;t .
his name is dante pryor , and he seems to be a ghost ?
jackie florrick .
ronald .
i heard you were ill , and it ...
reminded me of just how long it &apos;s been
since we &apos;ve seen each other .
yes . when you &apos;re in the hospital ,
you find out who your friends are .
yes , you do .
and i brought you flowers .
hey , rach . look who &apos;s here .
you remember jackie ?
hi , rachel .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
and how are you feeling ?
well , the diagnosis is not good .
but the bright spot ...
is the way rachel has stuck by my side .
yes , she &apos;s very special .
i remember when she worked for the judge .
he &apos;d come home at night and sing her praises ...
jackie , why don &apos;t we talk outside ?
of course , my dear .
it &apos;s been a while since we &apos;ve caught up as well .
we &apos;d like to call dante pryor to the stand .
dante pryor ? okay . that &apos;s a name .
where is he ?
well , that &apos;s what we would like to know .
we can &apos;t find him .
why did you call him ?
dante pryor is a scabbit user
who goes by the online name of chubbysocks52 .
it &apos;s one of the names that was released to us .
why isn &apos;t he here ?
he &apos;s not human .
he &apos;s a robot .
objection .
dante pryor is a socialbot , created by scabbit
and released on their site as chubbysocks52 .
your honor , i have an objection . relevance .
it &apos;s only relevant if i can understand .
go on .
this socialbot was designed to appear human
and drive traffic from its chumhum account
and twitter feed to scabbit .
and it defamed your client ?
how could a robot defame your client ?
it &apos;s designed to repackage comments and gossip by others
and disperse it onto sites
so it can drive interested users back to scabbit .
you honor , a socialbot cannot defame ...
&quot; zayeed shaheed is a guilty muslim terrorist
who bombed the milwaukee festival . chubbysocks52 . &quot;
and @-@ and that ... all that is from this socialbot ?
yes . it &apos;s a computerized version of the worst part of human nature .
and it was built by scabbit .
therefore , scabbit is responsible .
any thoughts ?
your honor , we &apos;d like a recess to confer with our client .
go for it .
huh . this is different .
well , on the bright side ,
we weren &apos;t shot by the crack dealers on the corner .
hello ?
what ?
the spartan look ,
the neighborhood ...
reminds me of us starting out .
this wasn &apos;t anything like us .
yes , it is .
do you miss it ?
i don &apos;t know .
hello ?
cutting out early ?
yeah . this is generally the time i wire my ill @-@ gotten gains
to my account in the caymans .
what do you need ?
just a small clarification .
it appears you never had any student loans from law school .
how &apos;d you pay for it ?
me parents .
they owned the one movie theater in town ,
sold it so i could cover my tuition .
you said your father left you when you were eight .
me ma .
she owned the one movie theater in our town ,
sold it so i could cover my tuition ...
what game are you playing , mr. boyle ?
you got me all wrong , kalinda . i &apos;m not the game @-@ playing type .
i might be a fun @-@ loving type .
but games ? no .
too much energy .
then why don &apos;t you just come clean ? hmm ?
you know , sooner or later ,
i &apos;ll find out what i need to know .
great .
come at me .
i &apos;m here .
rachel , i admit i &apos;m disappointed , but i understand .
thank you for calling .
jackie .
yes , mr. gold ?
rachel keyser has dropped out
as supreme court candidate .
oh , that &apos;s certainly unfortunate .
but i &apos;m not at all surprised .
why is that ?
well , i heard her husband was ill .
i &apos;m sure she wanted to devote time to his care .
that &apos;s the only reason ?
what else could it be ?
you .
me ?
no .
i @-@ i &apos;m here to decorate peter &apos;s office . that &apos;s all .
jackie .
you can &apos;t do this .
do what ?
rachel has always done what &apos;s best for rachel .
it &apos;s always nice chatting with you , mr. gold ,
but , um , i have to find a place for this .
artwork . party planning .
you know , my domain .
$ 830,000 . that &apos;s our final offer .
we used to work for you .
there are always three offers before the final offer .
you shouldn &apos;t overestimate our generosity .
and you shouldn &apos;t underestimate how great it is
to watch you scrambling .
&apos;cause you know you lost .
so why don &apos;t we skip the next half hour of gymnastics
and get right to the $ 1.5 million
you have been authorized to offer .
mrs. florrick , you have a call .
take a message .
i think you &apos;re gonna want to talk to him .
this is alicia florrick .
oh , there you are .
hello to you , mrs. florrick .
this is george kluger .
george ... ?
g ...
otherwise known to you as judge kluger the magnificent .
ah , yes , of course , your honor .
is everything all right ?
oh , oh , yes . everything is just , uh , fine , thank you .
uh , mrs. florrick , please don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,
but i was wondering if you would like to get some coffee ?
excuse me ?
