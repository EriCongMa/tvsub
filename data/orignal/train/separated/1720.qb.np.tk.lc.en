第六季 第十一集
okay , now holding sides of hearth in position ,
lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs .
look at that , i built a fireplace with my own two hands .
you &apos;re so butch .
aw , i got a little paper cut .
of course you did .
your hands are softer than veal .
oh , before i forget , saturday i &apos;m planning a little
dungeons and dragons night with the guys .
really ? that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna spend your saturday night ?
oh , come on , i hardly ever get a chance to play anymore .
oh , you poor thing .
is having a real @-@ life girlfriend who has sex with you
getting in the way of your board games ?
little bit , yeah .
oh , great ! i &apos;ve always wanted to play dungeons and dragons .
yeah , oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i should &apos;ve mentioned this earlier .
you &apos;re not invited .
why not ?
amy , from time to time ,
we men need to break free from the shackles of civility
and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves .
by rolling dice
and playing make @-@ believe with little figurines ?
yeah , like a bunch of savages .
saturday night ?
but i &apos;ve been working late all week .
that was gonna be our night .
but i have to go .
we play as a group .
if @-@ if i &apos;m not there , then everyone will blame you .
they &apos;ll be all , &quot; bernadette ruined everything .
she &apos;s the worst . &quot;
so , you see ?
i have to play dungeons and dragons ...
for the marriage .
you &apos;re an idiot .
i &apos;m your idiot .
forever .
so , listen , i know we talked about
getting a bite to eat in silver lake ,
and then seeing the christmas lights in griffith park ,
but leonard &apos;s talking about a big d and d game at his place .
saturday night just went from crazy to epic !
all right , sheldon , to start our quest ,
you need to open this little christmas gift i got you .
a christmas gift ?
you know i don &apos;t enjoy christmas .
what &apos;s wrong with christmas ?
oh , where to begin ?
trees indoors .
overuse of the words &quot; &apos; tis &quot; and &quot; &apos; twas . &quot;
and the absurd custom of one stocking .
everyone knows socks belong in pairs .
who uses one sock ?
pirate with a peg leg ?
actually that helps , thank you .
would you just look inside ?
oh , a scroll .
i like scrolls .
they &apos;re my third favorite system of
transmitting the written word .
after stone tablets and skywriting .
&quot; you have all been summoned to join
a thrilling dungeons and dragons adventure .
your quest begins in
a secret northern village of elves
who have all been massacred . &quot;
i like where this is heading .
&quot; your task is to rescue their leader
from a dungeon of ogres . &quot;
oh , that &apos;s a saucy twist .
&quot; that leader &apos;s name :
santa claus &quot; &quot;
no , no , no !
it &apos;s actually , &quot; ho , ho , ho , &quot;
but you &apos;ll get the hang of it .
thought it &apos;d be fun to make
a quest with a holiday theme .
fun ?
mixing dungeons and dragons with christmas is
like making a sandwich of grape jelly ,
the best @-@ tasting jelly ,
and petroleum jelly , the worst @-@ tasting jelly .
okay , here we go .
&quot; you find yourselves
in the smoking remains of santa &apos;s village .
clearly , a great battle has taken place . &quot;
oh , man , the first monster i see ,
i &apos;m gonna sneak up behind him , whip out my wand ,
and shoot my magic all over his ass .
do you hear yourself when you say these things ?
okay , there are ogre tracks and a trail of
broken candy canes in the snow .
sheldon , what do you do ?
i signal my contempt for your cruel plan
to shove christmas joy down my throat
by making a gesture that says , &quot; get a load of this guy . &quot;
fine . howard , what do you do ?
i follow the ogre tracks ,
checking for secret doors along the way .
and you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor .
okay , guys , let &apos;s make a plan :
spell casters in the back , warriors in the front ...
no , screw that noise , i &apos;m going in .
hang on , santa , i &apos;m coming for you !
okay , you run into a room full of weapons ,
hit a trip wire ...
... a cannon blows your face off , you die , you &apos;re out of the game .
but ... a canon ?
am i really out of the game ?
lucky .
okay , come on , moving on .
wait , doesn &apos;t anyone have a rod of resurrection ?
because if you &apos;ve got one , i need it bad .
get in here with your rod and give it to me .
okay , you need to say these things
in your head before you say them out loud .
hey , guys .
i don &apos;t mean to interrupt your little game ,
but i thought you &apos;d like to see what you &apos;re missing out on .
so ...
bernadette ?
bernadette &apos;s wearing leopard @-@ print pumps
and a rack @-@ tastic red dress from forever 21 .
and there &apos;s amy ,
showing all kinds of ankle .
in an outfit i &apos;m assuming is from forever 63 .
and i , myself ...
... am wearing a little number that got me
out of two speeding tickets and jury duty .
i know they &apos;re making a rhetorical point ,
i just don &apos;t know what it is .
see you , boys . we are going drinking .
uh , wait , can i come with you ?
my character died .
sorry , raj , it &apos;s girls &apos; night out .
maybe another time .
okay ...
come on .
girls &apos; night , girls &apos; night !
how does he not hear that ?
so , what &apos;s the plan ?
are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson
by getting stinking drunk ,
luring strange men into the bathroom ,
and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses ?
no !
no !
geez , who &apos;s forever 63 now ?
can we get another bottle of champagne for the table ?
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s my treat .
thanks .
you should come to girls &apos; night more often .
and not just because if you weren &apos;t here ,
this would be a can of pabst .
my pleasure ; nothing makes me happier
than the chance to spoil a lady .
just ask my dog .
my vet says if i give her any more foie gras ,
she &apos;s going to die of gout .
hey , let &apos;s help raj meet a girl tonight .
no , no , no , i &apos;m fine .
okay , wait , are we talking one @-@ night stand
or do we want to get him into a relationship ?
let &apos;s get him laid !
stop it . you &apos;re ruining girls &apos; night .
raj , you &apos;re a great guy ,
you &apos;re in a bar full of single women ; let us help you .
yeah , you &apos;re a real catch .
i know you &apos;re shy , but that doesn &apos;t mean
you shouldn &apos;t have someone wonderful in your life .
that &apos;s sweet of you .
but what can you do to help ?
we &apos;ll nose around ,
see if we can find a nice girl , and then introduce you .
okay .
well , a couple of things .
don &apos;t tell them i come from money .
i want them to love me for me .
they must be insanely hot .
like , nines or tens .
nines or tens ?
okay , an eight is acceptable
if she &apos;s willing to bring another eight to the hot tub .
bottom line : you &apos;ll take any woman who &apos;ll have you , right ?
in a new delhi minute .
i don &apos;t remember you buying these miniatures in my store .
oh , uh , yeah .
i got &apos; em on amazon .
sure . i get it .
why support a friend
when you can support a multinational conglomerate
that is crushing the life out of that friend ?
i know , but when i shop online ,
i can do it on the toilet .
have you seen my store ?
the whole place is a toilet .
c @-@ can we please move this along ?
yeah , sorry .
uh , you come to the end of the tunnel
and find a large chest .
what do you do ?
and , howard , do not say ,
&quot; i feel up the large chest . &quot;
excuse me , i &apos;m a married man now .
i wasn &apos;t going to say anything so juvenile .
great . what do you do ?
i walk up to the large chest ,
bury my face in it and go .
i open the chest .
it &apos;s locked ,
but suddenly the door behind you slams shut
and now the walls of the room start closing in .
that &apos;s not good .
my character and i both have claustrophobia .
glowing letters appear on the chest that read ,
&quot; if squashed to death you wish not to be ,
sing of svaty vaclav and his victory . &quot;
who the hell is svaty vaclav ?
walls are getting closer .
oh , boy , happy place , happy place .
wait , svaty vaclav was the duke of bohemia .
you &apos;re ten seconds away from getting crushed !
nine , eight ...
what are we supposed to do ?
... seven , six ...
wait , wait .
svaty vaclav is better known as good king wenceslas
from the beloved victorian christmas carol .
never heard of it .
must be the one christmas song not written by a jewish guy .
... three , two ...
somebody sing the damn song !
* good king wenceslas looked out *
* on the feast of stephen *
* when the snow lay &apos; round about *
* deep and crisp and even *
the walls are getting slower .
* brightly shone the moon that night *
* though the frost was cru @-@ el *
* when a poor man came in sight *
* gath &apos;ring winter fu @-@ el *
the walls stop ! you &apos;re safe !
that was amazing , sheldon .
how did you know that ?
it was simple .
i combined a well @-@ known , historical fact
about bohemia with the memory of my grandparents ,
mee @-@ maw and pop @-@ pop , singing christmas carols
while i sat in front of the fire and tried to build
a high @-@ energy particle accelerator out of legos .
okay , continuing our quest .
w @-@ w @-@ wait .
there &apos;s still four more verses .
you don &apos;t sing a song and not finish it .
* hither , page , and stand by me *
* if thou know &apos;st it telling , *
* yonder peasant , who is he ? *
* where and what his dwelling ? *
* brightly shone the moon that night , though the frost ... *
looks like he &apos;s doing pretty good .
of course he is .
look , that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend .
she &apos;s angry , she &apos;s drunk ,
and her favorite movie is slumdog millionaire . i mean ...
that is some low @-@ hanging fruit .
oh , here he comes .
so , how &apos;d it go ?
great .
i bought her a couple of drinks ,
and she gave me her e @-@ mail address .
&quot; jennifer @ not @-@ even @-@ if @-@ you @-@ were- the @-@ last @-@ guy @-@ on @-@ earth.loser &quot; &quot;
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , raj .
why can &apos;t i find someone ?
i &apos;m smart , i &apos;ve got a cool job ,
and my naturally bronzed complexion means
i can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can &apos;t .
oh , honey , it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s them .
no , it &apos;s not .
she was too beautiful for me .
why would you say that ?
it &apos;s true .
i &apos;m always attracted to women i can &apos;t have .
i do it all the time .
i did the same thing with the two of you .
the two of them ?
i don &apos;t understand .
well , uh , there was a time when i had a thing for penny ,
and i thought she was into me , too ,
because she got drunk and naked
and climbed into bed with me .
but apparently i misread those signals .
and you liked bernadette also ?
that was before penny .
i make it a rule to only fall for
one of my friends &apos; girlfriends at a time .
i &apos;m very old @-@ fashioned that way .
so at , uh , some point ,
you probably had a thing for me , too .
no , not really .
oh , come on , raj , not even a little bit ?
not that i can think of .
think harder .
nope .
i guess the heart wants what the heart wants .
or in this case , doesn &apos;t .
i mean , at all .
what ?
* ye who now will bless the poor *
* shall yourselves find blessing *
done ?
i think the word you &apos;re looking for is &quot; bravo . &quot;
okay , you leave the room and find yourself
standing before a pool of melted snowmen .
melted snowmen ?
are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water ?
i don &apos;t know . what &apos;s the difference ?
it &apos;s a game of the imagination , leonard .
paint a picture .
fine .
you leave the room and find yourself
standing before a pool of melted snowmen .
there are carrots and lumps of coal in the water .
do we know what happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes ?
you see those , too .
oh , it &apos;s like i &apos;m really there .
i gotta tell you , this @-@ this is the most holiday fun i &apos;ve had
since my therapist changed my anxiety medication
and i stopped caring about the blood in my stool .
good story .
what are you drinking there ?
little eggnog ?
yes .
what , is there a problem ?
no , it &apos;s nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage .
pretty christmasy .
since when is eggnog a christmas drink ?
eggs are available all year &apos; round .
i &apos;ve been known to enjoy this poolside .
come on , sheldon .
you know all the christmas stories , and the carols ,
you &apos;ve got an eggnog mustache going on there .
just admit it .
you &apos;re getting a little yuletide spirit .
oh , don &apos;t be silly .
christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry .
why is this so important to you ?
honestly , because i had enough crappy christmases as a kid
and i &apos;m tired of you sucking the joy out of them now .
what was so bad about them ?
i grew up in a house full of crazy academics .
instead of leaving santa milk and cookies ,
we had to leave him a research paper .
and in the morning , you could tell he &apos;d been there
because the paper would be graded .
no wonder you love christmas .
that sounds amazing .
it wasn &apos;t amazing .
i got a c @-@ minus four years in a row .
yeah , i &apos;m familiar with your work .
c @-@ minus was your gift .
amy , i &apos;m really sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice .
i didn &apos;t have my first kiss till i was 22,
and the guy only did it so i &apos;d give him back his insulin .
sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants .
forget it .
i don &apos;t expect you guys to understand .
i understand .
in seventh grade , i played spin the bottle
and it landed on alina shankar .
she said if i came near her ,
she would break the bottle and cut me .
you think that &apos;s bad ?
in college , i passed out at a frat party
and woke up with more clothes on .
sometimes i get so lonely ,
i sit on my left hand until it goes numb ,
then i put it in my right hand
and pretend i &apos;m holding hands with another person .
i do that , too .
sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel .
and i let it .
it &apos;s kind of nice to talk to someone who understands
what it feels like to be alone .
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
but you &apos;re not alone anymore .
now you &apos;ve got sheldon .
i do .
and don &apos;t worry , someday you &apos;ll have somebody , too .
thank you .
i hope she &apos;s half as lovely and amazing as you are .
thank you , rajesh .
he wants me , i &apos;m good . we can go now .
damn it .
what ?
now that i know she doesn &apos;t like me ,
i &apos;m kind of into her .
all right .
i think i cracked the code to lower the drawbridge .
great . let &apos;s do it .
the drawbridge is lowering .
my carpal tunnel &apos;s acting up .
play through the pain !
you did it ! the drawbridge is down .
you cross the chasm
and find yourself in a small dungeon room .
and in the corner , chained to the wall ,
you see a bloodied and beaten santa claus .
he says , &quot; ho , ho , help me . &quot;
yes , we found santa !
christmas is saved !
don &apos;t ever tell my mother i said that .
i take out my skeleton key
and run to santa to unchain him .
but first , i cast a spell of paralysis on stuart and howard .
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t talk ; you &apos;re paralyzed .
i get right up in santa &apos;s big , fat face and say ...
well , well , well ,
jolly old saint nick , we meet again .
yeah , i believe the last time we spoke
was in the baybrook mall in galveston , texas ,
when i was five years old , isn &apos;t that right ?
uh , okay .
my mother dragged me there
and she plopped me down on your lap
and you asked me what i wanted for christmas .
and i told you &quot; my pop @-@ pop , &quot;
because that was the year my grandfather died .
i missed him and i wanted him back .
this is weird , right ?
pop @-@ pop was the only one in my family
who encouraged me to pursue science .
but you didn &apos;t bring him back , did you ?
instead , i got lincoln logs .
well , you can build a lot of neat things out of lincoln logs ,
but pop @-@ pop ain &apos;t one of &apos; em .
and now you &apos;re here asking me for something--
to save you .
well , sorry , mr. kringle ,
but today &apos;s not your day .
i &apos;m leaving you here to rot ,
and i hope the ogres feast on your bones .
i take the skeleton key ,
and i toss it into the chasm ,
and on the way out , i give santa
a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly !
形容圣诞老人的肚子
okay .
so wolowitz and stuart are paralyzed , santa &apos;s dead ,
and i picked this over having sex with my girlfriend .
santa ?
oh , hello , sheldon .
you should be asleep .
well , then , you shouldn &apos;t have jingle bells on your boots .
i &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you .
i &apos;m sorry i disappointed you when you were a little boy .
i @-@ i can do a lot of magical things ,
but unfortunately
bringing your pop @-@ pop back isn &apos;t one of them .
i understand .
but i @-@ i do have something special for you .
close your eyes .
oh , i hope it &apos;s a train .
oh , it &apos;s better than a train .
two trains ?
better .
i &apos;m getting three trains .
okay , open &apos; em .
this is for leaving me in the dungeon
to be eaten alive by ogres !
wait , uh , uh , hang on .
i @-@ in my defense ...
ho , ho , ho , ya big dork !
