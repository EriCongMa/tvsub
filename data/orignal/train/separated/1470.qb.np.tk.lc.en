as great as it is bringing a baby home from the hospital ,
there &apos;s one sound you absolutely dread waking up to ...
relatives .
i really never saw these wedding pictures , mamá .
how handsome and young papa looks .
ay , it makes me sad .
ay , i know that you miss him .
no . look at my ass .
there are two things in that picture i don &apos;t have anymore .
ay , mama , que loca .
sonia , can i help you ?
no , no , she &apos;s fine . it keeps her busy .
we need more corn . gloria , where is your garden ?
i will harvest some .
they don &apos;t live that way , honey .
gloria , give me the keys . we &apos;ll go to the market .
hey , you &apos;re all awake . i didn &apos;t hear you .
oh , look at my two handsome men .
mi nio , my little fulgencio umberto .
you know , about the name , we &apos;re not entirely sure ...
sonia , vámonos . good @-@ bye , fulgencio .
say good @-@ bye to fulgencio .
good @-@ bye , fulgencio .
his name is joe .
you tell her that we &apos;re not naming him
after her dead husband or his father before him .
his name was--
please don &apos;t say it again .
jay , i cannot go against my mother &apos;s will .
but she likes you .
maybe if you convince her ...
fulgencio umberto-- the initials are f.u. pritchett ,
which is exactly the way it feels right now .
is there some kind of dress code for godparents ?
you &apos;re not wearing a fedora , phil .
can you pick up the dry cleaning ?
that sounds like an offer i can &apos;t refuse .
yeah , we &apos;re not doing that .
so i got delayed picking up lily from dance class .
now gloria &apos;s got me running around
doing a thousand things for christening .
son of a bitch .
it &apos;s not that bad , really . i &apos;m just--i &apos;m venting .
i couldn &apos;t believe it . somebody &apos;s balloons
were blocking my billboard . philboard .
my philboard .
can we wear the same outfits at crispin &apos;s party
that we &apos;re wearing to the baptism ?
oh , you know what ? i don &apos;t know .
because you wanna be subdued at church
and then fabulous at night .
you know who would make a fortune ?
the designer who comes up with the little black dress for men .
i &apos;m bored .
i know , sweetie , but daddies are talking
about what we &apos;re gonna wear tonight ,
and that &apos;s a difficult conversation .
cry me a river .
lily .
i @-@ i &apos;m not loving this attitude .
you seem a little mean .
sorry . should i call you a wah @-@ mbulance ?
oh , my gosh . she has been so snarky lately .
i know . i &apos;ve actually been getting nervous
when we &apos;re making her late for something .
because of what she said the other day ?
&quot; today , ladies . &quot;
hurtful .
you know , she hears us doing it ,
so we--we should try and be less negative .
model some better behavior .
yeah . well , you know , if it &apos;s a model she needs ,
she &apos;s come to the right place .
oh , boy .
hmm .
i wish lily was in here ,
so she could hear me not comment on that .
i get it . you &apos;re modeling .
hey , it &apos;s phil dunphy again .
i @-@ i got cut off by your machine .
i &apos;m , uh , not sure where i left off there ,
but i &apos;ll attempt to be brief ,
as i do appreciate when people do the same for me .
anyhoo , uh , your balloons are co--damn it !
is anyone home ? mom !
i need her first . mom !
she &apos;s out .
why is she always gone when we need an adult ?
i can help .
what &apos;s with the cage ?
science project .
mom , where are you ?
out . it &apos;s just the three of us .
four .
i need her .
rats .
i know , right ?
guys , i &apos;m right here . what do you need ?
no , it &apos;s okay . we &apos;re good .
okay , never mind .
no . no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
family meeting . everybody grab some &apos; za .
we &apos;re gonna talk about this .
listen , i know you guys like to go to mom ,
because she &apos;s mr.tough guy problem @-@ solver .
she gets results .
yeah , she does . she does . you &apos;re right .
like the last time we got pizza from our favorite place here .
remember that ? we got shortchanged ,
she cursed a blue streak and got our money back ?
how &apos;s that pizza , by the way ?
pretty good . it &apos;s okay .
liars !
it &apos;s garbage .
that &apos;s not scardino &apos;s , it &apos;s scandoni &apos;s .
you know why ?
&apos;cause your mom &apos;s little blow @-@ up
got us banned from scardino &apos;s for life .
so maybe your mom &apos;s way isn &apos;t always the best way .
now why don &apos;t you guys tell me what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m having a &apos; 60s @-@ themed birthday party next week .
hippies , bell @-@ bottoms , tie @-@ dye .
karen sullivan heard about it ,
and decided to have the same party ... tonight .
not groovy .
i accidentally called my teacher &quot; mommy . &quot;
my &quot; friend &quot; reuben went around and told everyone .
oh , hey , reuben ,
do you remember that class field trip to the zoo
when the zebra rushed the fence and you peed your pants ?
i didn &apos;t tell anyone , not even on the bus ride home
when he had to sit next to mom--
ms. bockman ! damn it !
our neighbor &apos;s out of town ,
and she &apos;s paying me to move her car on street cleaning days .
now i would just park it in her driveway ,
but she already has a camper and a cord of wood there .
pretty sure she &apos;s a lesbian .
anyway , easy money , right ?
oh , my god , i can &apos;t see anything !
hard starboard !
what does that even mean ? !
how much longer do i have to block people ?
i &apos;m late for the airport .
dylan , you are being no help right now !
sorry , but i &apos;m already in trouble with dispatch
for drinking all those little waters .
drive ! do it now !
how do i tell her i snapped a branch
on her beloved lemon tree ?
i mean , she boils the leaves
to add a scent to her own work boot oil .
did i mention she plays in two softball leagues ?
now what are you guys gonna do ?
you gonna have your mom go around
and yell at all these people and burn a bunch of bridges ?
or are you gonna talk to your reubens ,
your karens , your lemon ... lady ,
tell &apos; em how you feel ,
appeal to their human side ?
the choice is pretty simple , huh ?
so she &apos;s out all day ?
i &apos;ll try her cell .
it &apos;s off .
i texted her while dad was talking .
pilar , i brought you a coffee .
oh . i put a little something extra in it .
jay , you devil .
hey , by the way , look ...
it &apos;s beautiful , no ?
it &apos;s the dressing gown for fulgencio &apos;s christening .
all the men in our family wear this .
what &apos;s one more son in a dress ?
oh , tradition . oh , it &apos;s so important .
i have a gift in here for little fulgencio .
that has been in my family for three generations .
you know , about this naming thing--
in america , it &apos;s not real common to hear the name fuljencio .
it &apos;s &quot; ful @-@ hen @-@ cio . &quot;
hen ?
hen .
i don &apos;t need to practice it &apos; cause i can &apos;t name my son that .
i &apos;m just being honest with you .
no . no , no , no , no , that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s good . i should be more honest with you sometimes .
well , we &apos;ve known each other a few years .
i don &apos;t like you , jay .
nah . we can act like everything is fine for the family ,
but , you know , i have never liked you .
the way you take whatever looks good to you--
you know , like my daughter or the last piece of meat .
you &apos;re always too busy to pick me up at the airport .
you send a total stranger with a cardboard sign .
hi , grandma .
hey .
hey , buddy . get over here .
i sure do love the cross you got me .
but do i have to wear it today ?
it &apos;s kinda hard to close my shirt over it .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
you do whatever you want , padrecito .
i know that &apos;s the way in this house .
but if you wear it , ooh , you &apos;ll make me proud .
it &apos;s been in my family for five generations .
okay . i &apos;ll walk you out , buddy .
is anything in her family new ?
just you .
okay . excuse me . sorry .
all right . here we &apos;ve got the deli platter ,
and there &apos;s more in my car .
but those are not from rumpernook &apos;s .
no , because the cheese at rump ...
i don &apos;t go there anymore .
i &apos;m going to do the laundry .
okay , sonia . i love you so much .
wow . pretty cozy with the new housekeeper , huh ?
she &apos;s my sister .
wow . pretty weird with your sister .
she likes to keep busy . but i feel bad for her .
i have so much , and she has nothing .
okay . well , people make their own choices .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re responsible .
no , no .
maybe just a little bit .
i was older and i had opportunities to travel ,
and i took them .
well , it didn &apos;t prevent her from going anywhere .
no , no .
maybe just one time .
there was a letter that arrived from america
about a job opportunity .
and it was only for one person ,
and i went .
but it &apos;s not like the envelope was addressed to her ,
and you opened it and ...
you &apos;re evil .
i had to get out of there , claire .
you just strapped on those high heels
and walked right over her back , didn &apos;t you ?
maybe a little bit .
where is the river ?
hey , boys !
crispin .
hey , shouldn &apos;t you be preparing
for your annual party of the century ?
it &apos;s done and it &apos;s perfect .
in my mind , i &apos;m already into next year &apos;s .
listen , i &apos;m here with brett .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen his new look ,
but you are going to have a heart attack and die .
no one &apos;s dying .
it &apos;s just an expression .
yeah .
hey , handsome .
yep , i did it .
pulled the trigger and got a perm .
you sure did .
did it myself , right in the kitchen .
you don &apos;t need to spend a million
to look like a million .
uh , you know , my coffee &apos;s probably ready , so ...
bye .
okay , that &apos;s like a chia pet , right ?
maybe a drag production of &quot; annie &quot; ?
oh , actually , lily ,
i @-@ i think uncle crispin &apos;s forgetting
that brett has feelings ,
and we need to try and not hurt them .
yes , and maybe we should remind uncle crispin
that when you say nice things to people ,
they say nice things back .
well ... consider me reminded .
gotta run .
yeah , we &apos;ll see you tonight . bye .
okay . yeah , can &apos;t wait . can &apos;t wait .
he &apos;s funny .
yes , he is , but he can also be biting .
he bites people ?
well , with his words ,
not with his teeth like xander from art class .
we need to confirm he got his shot .
yeah .
oh , my god . okay , crispin--
&quot; too many rsvps . have to make cuts to party .
maybe next time . &quot; sad face .
because we refuse to abuse ,
we get banned from the party of the century ?
does somebody need a wah @-@ mbulance ?
no.i do not need a wah @-@ mbulance .
hey , kids . how was your day ?
i knew the answer to that question .
i &apos;d had kind of a busy day
going around solving everyone &apos;s problems .
i started by going to see my buddy stavros the florist .
stavros , i assume ?
yes ?
i just wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood .
oh , thank you .
yeah , i brought you some sandwiches , by the way .
how good is lamb , huh ?
nikos !
oh ! gotcha .
get back in there .
i &apos;m so sorry .
is there anything i can do for you ?
oh , no . no . i ...
that &apos;s when i realized my kids didn &apos;t understand
the concept of killing with kindness
because they &apos;d never seen it .
so i decided i &apos;d prove it to them
by going on a huggacidal rampage .
is that reuben rockin &apos; the potter specs ?
quiddiculous !
hey , listen , buddy ,
i heard about luke calling his teacher &quot; mommy . &quot;
epic fail , by the way .
but , you know , since you &apos;re one of the cool kids ,
maybe you could get the other ones to ease off a little ?
cool . air bump .
hey , lee , it &apos;s phil dunphy from down the street .
we haven &apos;t met . i was actually calling
to leave a message for your wife ,
just to say thanks for hiring my daughter haley .
listen , we &apos;d love to have you and the missus over for a glass of wine ,
or--or , uh , maybe you and i could go out for a boys &apos; night .
but anyway , if you could--
damn it !
hey , karen sullivan . alex &apos;s dad .
well , look whose teeth got so nice and straight .
who wants to go first ?
are you kidding ?
are you crazy ?
what are you trying to--
one at a time !
you called ms. cooper a man !
no , i didn &apos;t .
i got her husband lee on the machine .
there is no husband !
she &apos;s lee !
weirdly deep @-@ voiced , alcoholic , gay lee cooper
who you invited out for a glass of wine !
thanks to your little charm offensive with karen ,
one thing did change about her party--
i &apos;m not invited !
&quot; quiddiculous &quot; ? &quot; epic fail &quot; ?
now the whole school is just laughing at both of us .
stavros , hey !
why not ? !
what ?
change of plans .
this isn &apos;t over .
i want you to wear something beautiful tonight .
so please , choose .
what is this room ?
this is the closet .
so all the people of the town ,
they leave their nice clothes with you ?
no . these are all my clothes .
but ... i do miss the simple things at home .
so tell me , how-- how are things in the village ?
we had a flood .
ay , but it--it wasn &apos;t a bad one , right ?
we had a boat .
ay , that &apos;s great .
we had a boat .
are you dating anyone ?
you remember antonio marquez ?
yes , of course .
the most handsome boy in the school
with those beautiful eyes .
his father with the wooden leg ...
he lost it in the flood .
so is it serious ?
don &apos;t look at that .
i won &apos;t . trust me .
please . it &apos;s pathetic .
crispin &apos;s been getting all of our friends
to text us the details of his great party .
such torture , huh ?
oh , catering by amelia &apos;s .
topless valet parkers .
sting .
exactly .
no , sting is at the party .
mitchell , i wanna be there .
cam .
no , come on .
who are we kidding ? you do , too .
today , ladies !
okay , right there . that .
that is why we are making the sacrifice--
for our daughter .
oh , yeah , you &apos;re right .
i mean , i &apos;m the last one who should be complaining
when , let &apos;s face it ,
lily &apos;s snarkiness is my doing .
well , what &apos;s done is done .
let &apos;s just get ready for church .
yeah , i mean , it &apos;s just hard to not feel guilty ,
you know , when it &apos;s mostly my fault .
i get it . just don &apos;t beat yourself up .
hey . pocket square ? no pocket square ?
really ? you &apos;re taking zero of the responsibility , or ...
oh . were you trying to get me to take the blame ?
maybe just a little .
oh , and deny you the chance to play the martyr ?
look , cam , if you &apos;re looking for me to be the bad guy ,
you &apos;re snarking up the wrong tree , okay ?
you are the one who can &apos;t let a single situation pass
without making a comment .
oh , well , maybe i &apos;ll just start today .
i think it &apos;ll make you feel better .
i think i already do .
right to my face , &quot; i don &apos;t like you . &quot;
nobody doesn &apos;t like me .
i &apos;m jay . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m salt of the earth .
why are you inhaling my baby ?
oh , they only smell perfect like this for a little while .
yeah . that &apos;s the stuff .
from day one , i &apos;ve treated this woman like a queen .
i &apos;ve flown her back and forth ,
i &apos;ve ... i &apos;ve tasted her native food .
you know what chin tastes like ?
mm . &apos; cause i do .
and now to find out ...
what ? i &apos;m listening .
you &apos;re rubbing yourself with the baby .
i have seen you french kiss your dog .
she was taking a treat out of my mouth .
that &apos;s a trick .
i am sure you know
what i find funny about this situation .
what ?
you have an in @-@ law who , no matter what you do ,
no matter how hard you try , you can &apos;t win over .
what about it ?
wait . that doesn &apos;t sound familiar ?
you &apos;re not saying ...
yeah , i am .
son of a bitch , i &apos;m phil .
hey , pilar , it &apos;s awfully cold .
here . why don &apos;t you take my jacket ?
sure , yeah . make me the rude one .
look , i &apos;m sorry that i pointed out
that we &apos;re both to blame here , all right ?
but let &apos;s not turn this lovely event
into a competition . here you go , sweetie .
oh , you know what ? you &apos;re right . i shouldn &apos;t be picking at you .
but don &apos;t forget to light your candle .
i think everyone in the immediate family &apos;s doing it .
oh , yeah ? okay . good--good idea .
what the hell is that ?
some kind of gay protest thing ?
it &apos;s a candle , dad . what are you talking about ?
you &apos; purple panty tail .
oh , no . oh , come on .
we &apos;re in church , mitchell , not some disco .
you did that on purpose !
oh , this stained glass is beautiful .
now listen , before we dunk the kid ,
you mind if i make a few casual remarks ?
i think you already did .
claire asked me a good question--
how did phil win me over ?
well , he hasn &apos;t yet .
but when he stops trying so hard ,
and he acts like a real person , he comes close .
that &apos;s what i needed to do with pilar .
i &apos;d like to tell you the story
of how i came to meet my incredible wife ,
because up until the birth of this child ,
it &apos;s the best thing that ever happened to me .
mm , that feels good huh ?
so it &apos;s morning . my car &apos;s getting waxed .
i hop in the diner .
i hear this adorable accent .
i turn . i see this pretty girl talking to her friend .
i send over a piece of pie .
all class .
couple of minutes later ,
who comes over to thank me but gloria ,
the most beautiful woman i &apos;ve ever seen .
amen .
she sits down , we start talking ,
and we haven &apos;t stopped talking since .
but here &apos;s the crazy part--
i didn &apos;t send the pie to gloria .
her back was to me .
i sent it to her friend ,
who went to the bathroom and missed it .
and that person is here today--
gloria &apos;s sister sonia .
isn &apos;t it funny how a simple twist of fate
can change the whole--
you stole my life !
wait , wait , wait , wait . hold on , hold on .
i got sonia !
no more . i want my own life , my own bed ,
my own e @-@ mail account !
yeah , leave your poor old mother alone .
don &apos;t worry , mama . you can come and live with us .
whoa . pump the brakes here .
what ? do you have a problem with my mother ?
no . your mother has a problem with me .
you think she &apos;s helpless . ask her what &apos;s in that box .
it &apos;s not the family gun ?
jay , if anything should happen to gloria ,
i am there for you .
what , sonia ? what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
you might go for a walk in your closet one day
and never come back !
see what you &apos;re missing ? huh ?
where is luke ?
i think he &apos;s the one standing next to matthew .
phil .
he was feeling a little under the weather .
i let him stay home .
or is he just too embarrassed to leave the house ?
why would he be embarrassed ?
because dad tried to fix all our problems ,
and instead , ruined all our lives .
nightmare .
you girls are so dramatic .
do i need to call you a wah @-@ mbulance ?
did you hear that ?
yes !
claire &apos;s been driving lily to dance class all week .
that &apos;s where she gets it from !
we &apos;re not bad parents . claire is .
i said i wasn &apos;t gonna cry ,
but , oh , boy , here it comes .
no , no , cam . not with those .
okay ! that &apos;s it !
we &apos;re in a house of god , damn it .
fine . everyone just abandon me .
pilar , all due respect ,
no one &apos;s buying the martyr act .
not even this guy .
you ask me , you &apos;ve been keeping this one under your thumb
&apos;cause you &apos;re afraid of going on with your life .
but you &apos;re an attractive woman with a lot to offer .
this could be an opportunity .
i don &apos;t even think i knew what happiness was till i was 60 .
and the hits just keep coming . okay .
sonia , we &apos;re gonna help you get your own place ,
have some independence .
and if you ever get lonely ,
you come visit us as much as you want ...
with--within reason .
and we &apos;ll send this one down to visit you .
what ?
but he &apos;s not gonna become a priest &apos; cause he likes girls .
can &apos;t get &apos; em , but he likes &apos; em .
so ... everybody think about it .
but not for too long .
there &apos;s an a.a. meeting here at 6 : 00 .
sonia , please , let us do this for you .
i really want you to be happy .
can you forgive me ?
it will take some time .
as much as you need .
and some dresses .
as many as you want .
and some shoes .
you &apos;re angry now .
whatever happened with the kids ,
i don &apos;t want you to feel bad about it .
i don &apos;t .
i now invite the godfather and the godmother to join us .
don &apos;t worry .
i will take care of everything tomorrow .
that may not be necessary , my wife .
phil and claire , as godparents ,
are you ready to help
the parents of this child in their duties ?
we are .
we are .
do you renounce satan ?
i do renounce him .
i do renounce him .
and all his works ?
i do renounce them .
and all his empty promises ?
oh , my god !
i do renounce them .
godfather , is it your wish that this child be baptized ?
it is .
in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit ,
what name have you given the child ?
fulgencio joseph pritchett .
may god be with you all .
thank you , jay .
we &apos;re never gonna call him that .
so i heard that somebody
released a bunch of rats into karen sullivan &apos;s party the other night .
and lee cooper &apos;s camper just rolled into her lemon tree .
luke isn &apos;t having any problem at school anymore ,
because reuben admitted he made the whole thing up .
isn &apos;t that crazy ,
how all our of kids &apos; problems just disappeared ?
don &apos;t ever ask me about my business , claire .
what are you talking about ?
don &apos;t ask me about my business .
i wasn &apos;t .
good .
