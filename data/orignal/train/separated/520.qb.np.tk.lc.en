target rich
this guy stumbles in to the atlantic city e.r.
having been shot in the jaw .
they were able to get a name , giuseppe montolo ...
he &apos;s a contract killer .
only a hitman would be this good .
you &apos;re under arrest .
he &apos;s playing us .
the only leverage he has
is a list of potential victims targeted by a network of hitmen .
i know there &apos;s more of you out there ,
but me and my team will not rest
until we take every last one of you sons of bitches down .
the dirty dozen .
this is who you &apos;re gonna kill next .
your lawyer told me you &apos;re ready to talk .
can you talk ?
i can talk .
any deal we make is contingent on actionable intelligence .
that means we make an arrest
before we make you comfortable .
capisce ?
you &apos;re part of an interconnected group of hitmen
working together online--yes or no ?
si .
how many of them are you ?
besides me , cuatro .
i need names and contact information .
the last time we talked ,
you hinted that this was your next target--
the dirty dozen . who are they ?
that &apos;s the wrong question .
it &apos;s not a who ...
it &apos;s a what .
what does that mean exactly ?
look , cut the act ! i ain &apos;t in the mood to play with you .
what does it mean ? !
don &apos;t choke !
hey ! i need medical !
‭ don &apos;t choke !
get me medical !
hi ! yay ! bellissimo !
ohh ! welcome back !
welcome back .
i missed you guys .
oh , we missed you more .
oh , wow--oh , my gosh , nice . will &apos;s favorite brand .
thank you , rossi .
and , spence , wow .
it &apos;s my original set .
and i realize that most of this information
is most likely on that &quot; internet , &quot;
but you can never teach old @-@ fashioned research habits too soon .
how &apos;s the little guy doing ?
oh , he &apos;s good .
he &apos;s sleeping through the night for now , at least .
oh , and , spence , i showed him the picture of when you first visited
and he started kicking his little legs
and he smiled real big .
who wouldn &apos;t get excited seeing that bella faccia ?
i think he wants to see you .
you know , studies have shown
that babies begin exhibiting cognizable nonverbal communication
within days of birth .
and some things never change .
yeah . and some things do ,
and because of that , we took the liberty of doing ...
this .
it &apos;s all the pictures you sent while you were away .
you guys , i love it .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s perfect .
thank you , all of you .
almost all of you .
they &apos;re debriefing .
the warden determined that montolo had been poisoned
by one of the guards .
did they make an arrest ?
no . the guard was found shot execution style in his car .
hotch , montolo was our only viable lead .
when i asked him who the dirty dozen were ,
he said it &apos;s not who , it &apos;s what .
so maybe it &apos;s not a list of human targets like we thought .
it could just be something in the hitmen &apos;s infrastructure .
well , it doesn &apos;t change our investigation .
i &apos;ll have garcia search the darknet with new parameters .
yeah .
well , for the next 5 minutes , anyway ,
i just want to enjoy the fact that our friend is back .
ok , and this is your bureau approved bubbly .
cheers . ok , now tell me all about tara lewis .
she is really excited to meet you .
i think here exact words after reading your reports were ,
&quot; is jj as awesome as i think she is ? &quot;
i like her already .
ok , you did not just have a baby .
hey , you .
‭ welcome back .
seriously , talk to me . what is your secret ?
&apos;cause you look good .
well , yeah , see these guns ?
it &apos;s from lugging around two boys all day .
oh , baby weightlifting . i would buy that dvd .
excuse me .
ssa rossi .
cider .
hey , dad , it &apos;s me .
joy ?
yeah . uh , this is my work cell .
sorry you didn &apos;t recognize the number .
well , everything ok ?
are you still at that conference in new york ?
uh , no , actually .
we need to talk .
are you at your office ?
yeah .
great . so am i.
ok , so it started as a long form piece
that i &apos;m writing for &quot; esquire &quot; on campus violence against women .
after the whole uva debacle ,
my editor told me i needed to triple source everything ,
and that &apos;s when i came across this pattern .
missing freshmen and sophomores , all women .
4 over 9 years .
they were taken from different east coast campuses .
by the time their families realize that they &apos;re missing ,
the trail is cold .
so i put out an alert on campus chat rooms ,
and this morning i got a call about her .
bahni desai .
her sister said she went missing last night
from judy temple college .
what do the campus police think ?
it hasn &apos;t been 24 hours , so there &apos;s nothing they can do .
look , it might be a coincidence .
but i have cried with 4 families ,
and i don &apos;t want hers to be number 5 .
give me a second .
we haven &apos;t been invited in .
no .
and the missing student might be fine .
she might .
i know i &apos;m asking a lot ,
but joy is my daughter .
look , all i &apos;m saying is that we talk to campus police ,
friends , rule out any foul play .
and we could get answers a lot faster than joy could .
exactly .
so , what do you say ?
&quot; we are all sharks , circling ,
and waiting , for traces of blood to appear in the water . &quot;
alan clark .
4 cases in 9 years . how come this hasn &apos;t been on our radar ?
because the disappearances
were in different states with different m.o.s.
the first missing woman was kathy miller from nyu in 2006 .
so what &apos;s the plan once we land on campus ?
track bahni &apos;s movements . campus police checked her room .
she &apos;s not there . they taped it off for you .
what about her cell phone ?
it just pinged in her room overnight .
strange for millennials to go anywhere without a phone .
no credit card activity .
i confirmed with all ticket agencies
she didn &apos;t take a boat , bus , blimp , or plane last night .
oh ! dean &apos;s office just sent us her file from judy temple college .
it looks like ... oh , dear .
looks like what ?
she voluntarily withdrew .
dad , this is bahni &apos;s sister aasia .
thank you for coming .
thank you for helping .
we were supposed to meet in d.c. this morning .
after two hours of bahni &apos;s mobile going to voicemail ,
i called the campus police .
the phone is in the room , but she isn &apos;t .
there &apos;s something else we need to talk about .
did she tell you she was withdrawing from school ?
she was ?
she got a b @-@ plus on her midterm .
she thought her world was over .
aasia , you never told me that .
she picked up extra @-@ credit work
and she was going to withdraw her request on monday .
this , whatever &apos;s happening ,
it isn &apos;t related to that .
i need you to believe me .
i do .
excuse me .
i have to say something .
you &apos;re not gonna like hearing it .
sometimes emotion can cloud our judgment in an investigation .
we see smoke , but there &apos;s no fire .
so , you don &apos;t think this is related to the other cases ?
i &apos;m not saying that ,
yet . you and i are going to take this as far as it will go .
she definitely didn &apos;t plan on leaving town .
her clothes , shoes , and luggage are all still here .
well , it looks like she was trying on different outfits .
mini skirts , heels . she was clearly going out .
but why not take her phone ?
she &apos;d need it to meet up with her friends ?
unless her friends were already here .
reid , same textbooks , different names .
she wasn &apos;t studying alone .
might be the last person who saw her .
paddy morris , this is the fbi .
very funny , josh .
it &apos;s too early for this ...
you &apos;re not josh .
another left and another right !
4 times ...
tommy ?
is that you ?
no !
get in .
no !
shut up ! shh !
you shut up !
i was with her last night . she was fine .
any idea why she left her cell phone in her room ?
we didn &apos;t take purses , and we didn &apos;t have pockets in our skirts .
ok , walk us through the night .
you guys were studying before you went out ?
yeah . um ...
i knew about this party .
she didn &apos;t want to go .
he said he &apos;s definitely gonna be here .
do i look ok ?
you look perfect .
we can only stay for an hour .
i &apos;m meeting my sister super early .
ok , fine . stop stressing .
show off your assets , please .
this is the first time i &apos;ve seen you dressing for fun .
ok ! that &apos;s enough .
get ready to have your mind blown ,
because this party is going to be epic .
this guy was in class today asking
why his python encode wouldn &apos;t work . i &apos;m like--
girls are here .
so it wasn &apos;t epic .
it was most decidedly not ...
epic .
did you two come back to the dorm ?
no . i made her stay .
why ?
there was this tennis guy
that i &apos;d been trading tweets with .
he said he &apos;d show up , but he was late ,
and then the later it got , the more i drank .
no ...
how much did you have ?
her , i don &apos;t know , me , a lot . until ...
let &apos;s get this party start--
peter !
honey . how &apos;s it going ? i ...
paddy .
paddy , hi . right .
i &apos;m going now .
what ?
i &apos;m going .
sure .
did anyone walk out after her ,
maybe try to escort her ?
not that i saw .
god , it &apos;s my fault , isn &apos;t it ?
no , it &apos;s not .
but there &apos;s still a way you can help us .
anything . name it .
where was the party ?
ok , mapping the route from
the not @-@ so @-@ awesome house party to bahni &apos;s dorm .
what are those icons there along the street ?
security cameras .
they line the perimeter of the campus .
and to answer your
next question , that is real good news for us
because it means that we can pull the feed from last night
and presto .
start at 1 a.m. and go forward .
roger .
got her .
looks like she &apos;s stumbling a little .
drunk , alone at night .
she &apos;s a low @-@ risk vic a high @-@ risk environment .
wait , wait . right there .
stop .
all right , back it up .
yeah . can you enhance that ?
oh , my god .
garcia , what &apos;s the next camera they show up on ?
none of them .
joy , you were right to come to us .
we &apos;ll open a case and coordinate
with campus and alexandria p.d.
i &apos;ll make sure this is their top priority .
thank you .
i &apos;ll be right back .
i went to darfur on assignment .
did i ever tell you that ?
no .
it was just after i was married ,
before kai was born .
i saw the worst a human being can do to another .
but this is still so ...
the first disappearance you uncovered ,
kathy miller , nyu , 2006 .
you went to nyu in 2006 .
that &apos;s why you started this investigation .
tell me about kathy .
i didn &apos;t know her , really .
we just had one class together .
even though there was never a body ,
her parents had a memorial .
and i went &apos; cause she was so young .
and it could have been me .
so what do you think the chances are of finding bahni ?
better because it was reported right away .
i want to tell you we &apos;ll find her ,
but realistically i can &apos;t . but we have a picture now .
we &apos;ll build a profile . we &apos;ll go to the press .
bahni has a shot
that she wouldn &apos;t have without you .
and here he comes , surging down the stretch to home ,
just in time , going full out .
what are you doin &apos; up there ? !
if you scream , i &apos;ll kill you .
look ...
i don &apos;t want to hurt you , ok ?
i &apos;m hungry !
get your ass down here !
get me some food !
do you hear me ?
ok !
this is your room now .
i &apos;m keeping you .
this is the last spot she was seen .
the next camera is 100 feet down ,
which makes this the abduction zone .
well , alexandria police searched the buildings . nothing there .
well , if she got in the car with him ,
they would have shown up on the camera down the street .
but shoving her in the trunk of a car
out in the open like this , it &apos;s too risky .
that leaves this .
everything ok ?
actually , no . my mom &apos;s not doing so well .
the doctors have had to change her medicine 3 times
to try to stabilize the schizophrenia .
spence , why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
i don &apos;t want to bother you .
ok .
that &apos;s never possible .
got it ? how long has this been going on ?
it &apos;s gotten really bad the past few weeks .
look , the minute we are done here ,
you need to go help her . she needs you .
i know . right now so does bahni .
all right , let &apos;s think this through .
all right , if he took her out this way , it &apos;s a busier street .
the traffic was lighter last night ,
but it &apos;s still a risk to abduct someone in plain sight .
so he was able to control
a drunk woman and it didn &apos;t look suspicious .
he probably just put his arm around her and walked off .
she was too drunk to even realize she was in danger .
you know , if this was just about the assault ,
he could have done that back in the alley .
i think this has gotta be some sort of long @-@ term play .
then he &apos;s been watching bahni ,
looking for the perfect opportunity .
well , he certainly found it last night .
she &apos;s a straight &quot; a &quot; student who never drinks
and rarely goes out .
ok , so if he watched and waited to take bahni ,
we should be looking for offenders with precursor crimes
of stalking and peeping .
greater metro area creeps coming up .
he &apos;s patient and organized .
he &apos;ll have a plan for
when she sobers up and becomes noncompliant .
he &apos;ll isolate her so it &apos;s easier to be dependent on him .
she &apos;s the most important thing in the world to him right now .
we need to get him to see her as a person .
the fbi is working to locate this woman ,
19 @-@ year @-@ old sophomore bahni desai .
she went missing last night from judy temple college .
we &apos;re also trying to identify this man .
we believe he has information
that will help us locate bahni .
isn &apos;t this man also a suspect ?
right now he &apos;s a person of interest ,
strictly a witness .
did he abduct her ? why isn &apos;t he being considered a threat ?
our focus right now is on bahni ,
which is why her sister aasia
would like to say a few words .
all my parents want ,
all i want ,
is to see bahni again soon .
please , call the hotline number if you can help .
when she arrived at school ...
that girl &apos;s probably chopped up
under the floorboards somewhere .
she always knows how to make everyone around her smile ,
especially children .
what--jeez , you can &apos;t do anything right , you stupid bastard .
and you &apos;re a worse cook than your mother .
why don &apos;t you just take this slop
and clean it up , you son of a bitch .
you get back here and clean this up , you hear me ? !
bahni , if you can hear me , we love you very much ,
and we &apos;ll never stop searching for you
until we have you back in our arms .
that was an fbi announcement regarding the abduction
of 19 @-@ year @-@ old bahni desai . we &apos;ll be coming back with ...
anything from the hotline calls ?
nothing legit . but there &apos;s a walk @-@ in
that security thinks you should talk to .
can i help you ?
i &apos;m the man in the video .
i saw the press conference .
you wanted to talk to me ?
this is agent jareau , mr. burnett . she &apos;ll be joining us .
call me sam .
is that your birthstone ?
uh , it &apos;s my son &apos;s .
it &apos;s beautiful .
thank you .
so , uh , mr. burnett , can you just--
just walk us through why you were on front street at 1 a.m.
i drive a cab . i &apos;m medallion 3469 .
and moonlight as a sober cabdriver .
it &apos;s a service local bars and campuses provide
to make sure kids get home safely if they &apos;ve gotten stupid .
front street &apos;s a good spot to post up and wait for fares .
i was checking my phone when i saw her .
‭ - bahni.- i don &apos;t know .
i guess .
what i noticed was how out of it she was .
i went to help .
then some dude came up and walked off with her .
it seemed like they knew one another .
can you describe him ?
big . my height .
he was wearing a hoodie , so i couldn &apos;t see his face .
but , i mean , that &apos;s the guy you should be looking for , right ?
ok , explain something to me .
um , why did you step back into the doorway ?
what do you mean ?
well , you saw bahni coming ,
you stepped back to let her pass , then you followed her .
listen , i came in here because you asked .
maybe that was a mistake .
after that guy went off with that girl ,
i got a fare , which i took .
my cab has gps . you can check it out .
if you don &apos;t believe me , maybe i should get a lawyer .
his gps and his cell phone confirm his whereabouts , sir .
and this was 5 minutes later .
yeah . no way he &apos;d have bahni in the trunk when he had customers .
you let him go ?
his alibi checks out .
dad , you said bahni had a
shot because we had a picture and a profile .
and in this case , the picture does not match the profile .
he followed her , dad .
there is something off about this guy ,
but he did not take bahni .
did you check his priors ?
no arrests at all .
joy , i &apos;m doing everything i can .
i know you are , dad .
i need some air .
the beauty of this one
is it covers the fruit or whatever you &apos;re slicing
so that your fingers are nowhere near the blade .
that &apos;s amazing !
and it &apos;s all uniform , all the same size .
now , just ...
don &apos;t touch that !
never , never touch that !
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry !
anyone see joy ?
not for a while . why ?
she asked about sam &apos;s rap sheet .
at the time , i didn &apos;t think it through . but she is a journalist .
and sam &apos;s a lead .
pull him up , garcia .
ok , uh , sam burnett .
no record . just his address and his date of birth .
he &apos;s about the same age as joy .
that &apos;s it . where did he go to college ?
he dropped out of nyu in 2006 .
the same time kathy miller went missing .
ok , but hold up . what are we saying ?
burnett did not take bahni .
but he could be an unsub .
when he talked about bahni &apos;s abduction ,
he wasn &apos;t concerned . he was jealous .
we have two separate unsubs
in a target rich environment .
and joy &apos;s going to confront the one we know .
garcia , ping her phone .
she &apos;s in the same alley that bahni was last seen .
now ping sam &apos;s .
thanks for meeting me here .
my pleasure .
what paper was this for , again ?
it &apos;s a magazine , actually .
so my sources tell me that you were
the last person to see bahni .
what did you see first ?
just her alone .
i wasn &apos;t sure if she was drunk or what .
but then that guy came up , put his arm around her ,
and walked her in here .
and what , they just disappeared ?
did he put her in a car ?
what did you see ?
everything .
i saw everything .
it &apos;s down here .
what ?
why didn &apos;t you tell the authorities ?
because i could have helped her and i didn &apos;t ,
and i feel bad about that .
i mean , who sees everything and does nothing ?
i could have made a difference last night .
instead , i just walked away .
well , it isn &apos;t too late . tell them whatever you can
and it could help .
well , one thing i remember .
when she got right here , he did this .
what the hell are you doing ?
you said you wanted to know what he did ,
and i &apos;m showing you .
you like this , don &apos;t you ?
what are you talking about ?
look at you . you &apos;re excited .
is this what you did to kathy miller ?
kathy miller ?
i haven &apos;t heard that name in a long time .
i remember her .
you should .
you killed her .
all i said was i remember her .
everyone remembers what happened to her .
we were just talking , agents .
sam burnett ...
you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ? !
assault . rossi , i got him .
what were you thinking ?
that &apos;s him , dad . i know it is .
then you definitely don &apos;t follow him down an alley .
you &apos;re a parent , for god &apos;s sake .
if kai did something this ...
there &apos;s no other word for it than--this stupid ,
how would you feel ?
there &apos;s more to this than kathy miller , isn &apos;t there ?
the week before she disappeared ,
i went to a frat party .
i got drunk ,
i walked home alone ...
and some guy in a ski mask grabbed me
and dragged me into the bushes .
and i screamed and screamed ,
and some voice in my head told me
that i needed to get up
because no one was coming to rescue me .
and so i fought and i scratched at him
and i jabbed my thumb in his eye ,
and then he ran off .
but you know what i didn &apos;t do ?
you didn &apos;t report it .
at college they talk about drunk girls a certain way ,
like it &apos;s their fault if they get attacked .
it &apos;s so unfair .
especially when a week later , another girl
goes missing because i didn &apos;t tell anyone .
it &apos;s not the same guy .
dad ...
the guy who hurt kathy was organized .
he had a place to take her .
the dirtbag who attacked you was impulsive .
he hadn &apos;t thought that far ahead .
well , none of this is helping bahni .
unless sam gave you some new details .
kathy miller ? i haven &apos;t heard that name in a long time .
dad , it &apos;s how he said it .
he got off toying with you .
i really thought i had more than this .
go back to the beginning ,
right before he admits to seeing everything .
and what , they just disappeared ?
did he put her in a car ?
what did you see ?
he paused when you asked about the car .
it &apos;s the only time he did that . everything else
he answered without hesitation .
maybe he avoided the question
because he didn &apos;t want to give you a clue .
penelope , we need you to pull up the security cameras again .
run registrations on all vehicles
on or around the campus after midnight .
this is ...
this is what i always order when i--
i know .
how long have you been watching me ?
long enough to know that i wanted you .
i &apos;m trusting you .
i &apos;m looking at the vehicles from earlier
and there &apos;s nothing extraordinary
about them or their owners .
any of them belong to judy temple students ?
two , but we already know they went home for the weekend .
some of sam burnett &apos;s story is true .
the unsub likely walked off with his arm around bahni ,
and it &apos;s highly doubtful that he would have
taken the chance to hurt her in public .
yeah , but then they just disappeared .
well , because he took her away ,
likely in a vehicle that fit in .
campus security should have a list of vehicles
that are authorized to drive onto campus .
cross @-@ check those against your list .
checking registrations .
there &apos;s a car . it looks like it &apos;s in the neighborhood .
it delivers chinese food to campus .
does bahni order from them ?
all the flippin &apos; time .
who &apos;s it registered to ?
22 @-@ year @-@ old tom larson . no criminal record .
check for juvenile offenses .
oh . bingo .
lots of misdemeanor peeping offenses in his teens .
it doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s a coincidence .
and every time he got busted ,
he &apos;d end up in the hospital
with bruises and broken bones .
probably an abusive father . was child services ever called ?
looks like the mom explained it away ,
until she committed suicide years ago .
you want to bet that she received the brunt of his abuse ?
oh , no takers on that bet .
looks like the elder larson had a heart attack last year
according to medical records ,
and the son is the primary caregiver .
caring for his own father who beat him ,
it was only a matter of time before he snapped .
we don &apos;t have two monsters , we have 3 .
garcia , send the address to rossi and jj .
what are you doing ?
no ! uhh !
help ! aah !
what the hell &apos;s going on up here ? !
please , help me .
that &apos;s that -- that &apos;s that girl from the news .
dad , you --
what have you done ? !
thank you . thank you .
tommy .
close the door , tommy .
we gotta get rid of her .
no .
no !
we &apos;re 3 miles out .
stay away from me !
dad , don &apos;t .
you made this mess , and we &apos;re gonna clean it up .
no !
she &apos;s mine .
not anymore .
i want to keep her .
dad , don &apos;t !
what , are you crazy ?
you don &apos;t record what we &apos;re about to do .
you moron .
grow a pair and be a man .
we gotta clean this mess up .
how &apos;s this for being a man ?
fbi ! drop your weapon !
get it off , get it off ,
get it off , get it off !
i need a knife .
he &apos;s gone , right ?
he &apos;s not coming back ?
do you even know what you did , tom ?
ok .
oh , my god .
yeah , i knew .
there you go . it &apos;s ok .
aasia .
i got nothing to say until my lawyer gets here .
except , the little recording that bitch made is inadmissible .
even i know that .
maybe so , but she &apos;s my daughter .
and that recording gave us probable cause
for a search warrant .
so you have a thing for necklaces .
see this ?
kathy miller &apos;s initials .
her grandmother gave it to her .
all right , let &apos;s make a deal .
let &apos;s not .
we tied him to the murder of 3 of the victims ,
including kathy miller .
look , we need to talk .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry that i went off to meet him .
you &apos;re right . it was --
i &apos;m stupid and reckless .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
what you survived in college is trauma .
it doesn &apos;t just go away because we do good
for somebody else .
you need to talk to someone .
like your old man , maybe .
because i won &apos;t lecture .
i &apos;ll just listen .
hang on .
that &apos;s my editor .
this is joy rossi .
just send me the latest version .
thanks .
joy rossi ?
i didn &apos;t get to use the name rossi growing up ,
so i thought i &apos;d try a new byline .
what do you think ?
i think i need to get a subscription to &quot; esquire &quot; &quot;
&quot; to a father ,
nothing is dearer than a daughter . &quot;
euripides .
you were that little once .
it seems impossible , doesn &apos;t it ,
that we all start out so helpless .
and we all end the same way .
are you gonna call your mom ?
it &apos;s not too late there , is it ?
tell her i said hi .
i will .
hey , mom .
i &apos;m good . how are you feeling ?
what do you think about me coming out
to visit for a little while ?
hey , baby girl --
leave it off , please ?
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m scared .
not the unnerved but you know
i &apos;ll pull through kind of scared .
i &apos;m scared scared .
i &apos;m right here .
talk to me .
hotch told me to review everything
that i had on the dirty dozen .
so i went back to look at the botnets
i used for the original search .
botnets , what &apos;s that ?
think linked computer systems completely randomized
with anonymous proxy servers
so no one can hack me . make sense ?
i don &apos;t pay attention to how many botnets i use .
it &apos;s like when you google something ,
you don &apos;t pay attention to the numbers ,
you just pay attention to the search results .
but when i went back to look at the digital breadcrumbs ,
someone was counting me .
i used 12 botnets , derek .
you &apos;re the dirty dozen ?
my filters work good , but if these hitmen
are as good as think they are ,
they could use a reverse worm protocol and then they could --
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . would they know it was you ?
they would know it was someone at fbi.gov at quantico .
that &apos;s why i shut everything down .
but it &apos;s just a matter of time --
no . no .
i &apos;m not about to let anything happen to you .
they killed montolo at a super max
and you were right there .
you can &apos;t stop them , derek .
no one can stop them .
