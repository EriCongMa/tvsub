The Black Queen
We've got you, Ms. Garcia.
If you say so, suit.
We've got evidence of your off-site servers
and of your hack into the cosmetics company.
They test on animals.
Yes, they do. But it's not illegal.
What you've done is a felony and it's punishable by prison.
Well, if you've got me, J. Edgar--
It's Agent Hotchner,
and I'm from the Behavioral Analysis Unit.
And I'm here to offer you an option to prison.
You come work for me.
You'd be our technical analyst.
So I teach you how to use google, that kind of thing?
That's fun.
You'd help us hunt psychopaths.
I'm a psychopath.
No, you're not.
In hacker circles you're known as the Black Queen.
And you are rigorously moral.
All of your online attacks reflect a fierce desire
to protect those who you think are being hurt.
If you accept my offer, you can do the same thing
for the federal government.
I just need a resume to give to human resources.
Or we prosecute you.
Well, I'm not in the habit of bringing my resume
to events I am handcuffed at,
but I have some stationery in my purse
and I'll write down some computer stuff I know and think about it.
I took out her phone and laptop.
Everything else is harmless.
Hotchner.
We'll be right there.
We have a suspect.
I need an answer.
Yes, if I can keep my purse.
Good choice.
Do you have a key?
Beauty and brains.
Hey, eyebrows.
When they do the men of the FBI calendar,
is it just 12 months of you?
Welcome to the team.
So, let's talk about sexual harassment.
Sexual harassment isn't always a quid pro quo arrangement.
Maybe it's a conversation between two co-workers
that makes you feel uncomfortable.
Maybe these co-workers use phrases like...
"Baby girl."
"Chocolate thunder."
Or..."where's my big black twelve-pack?"
Who blabbed?
And that creates a what?
A hostile work environment.
So messages like, "More cushion for the pushing.."
Not appropriate.
"I'll be coco to your ice-t."
Not appropriate.
"Flarpy blunderguff."
I don't even know what that means,
速到电梯口来见我
But not appropriate.
Ms. Garcia, you really have to stay for this.
I'm sorry, but I got-- I--I have to--I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so--I'm so, so sorry.
Not appropriate.
Oh, sir, I am so, so, so sorry about this.
Take a look at this.
Is this real? Is this happening?
Yes. And we're on our way
to the attorney general's office to explain it.
Uh, when you say we, you mean the whole team or...
I mean you and me.
In 2004, the BAU flew to San Jose for two reasons.
One was to recruit Garcia,
the other was to arrest this man Sam Russell.
The prostitute killer.
8 victims. He didn't fit the profile exactly,
but he waived his rights and admitted to all 8.
Isn't San Quentin putting him to death in two weeks?
Yes. And we've been tasked to review his conviction.
Why us?
Garcia?
Ok. Uh, this morning,
the Justice Department website was hacked.
When you log on, you see this
and then this.
Are these crime scene photos of the victims?
The San Jose police department was also hacked.
Garcia says this must have been months in the planning.
Any idea who's behind it?
Best guess is it's an online collective known as Star Chamber.
They're one of several justice oriented groups that sprung up
in the wake of the Steubenville rape case.
Star Chamber. Interesting name.
It's derived from a 17th century British court
designed to ensure fair enforcement of laws
against the rich and the powerful.
Actually, according to my research,
they named it that because it's also the name
of a mediocre yet awesome Michael Douglas movie from 1983.
Ok, but why Sam Russell?
He confessed without any coercion.
Because in addition to being a monster,
Sam Russell is a hacker extraordinaire.
I don't know the man, but I learned from him.
So the Star Chamber is rallying behind one of their own
before the state of California can put him to death.
And we get thrown the political football
to make the negative attention go away.
We have to separate ourselves from the politics of it
and ensure that they're executing the right man.
"People often say that this or that person
has not yet found himself.
But the self is not something one finds,
it is something one creates."
Thomas Szasz.
Well, looking at the history of Star Chamber,
they love riddles.
So this message, "they died in vein,"
spelled v-e-i-n,
that's not just a homonym mistake, it's a clue.
Yeah. That's their game--
"We know something you don't."
They're fiercely libertarian and anti-secrecy,
which goes hand-in-hand with conspiracy theorizing.
As far as they're concerned,
the whole Sam Russell thing is a cover-up.
Why did we close in on Russell as a suspect?
He was arrested repeatedly for solicitation.
All streetwalkers, all drug addicts.
His victims match that type.
Well, you said he didn't fit the profile.
It sounds like he fit it perfectly.
There was an issue with M.O.
4 of the prostitutes were stabbed and 4 were strangled,
and the unsub alternated between kills.
It sounds like two unsubs.
That was our profile until Russell
confessed to everything,
including names and details.
As far as we could tell, it was just him.
Yeah, but we can't take that for granted.
Dave, Blake, and Reid, go over the old files.
We need to re-interview everyone associated with the old case.
Morgan and Garcia, dig into Star Chamber.
We don't want to validate them,
but we need to know what they know.
And JJ and I will go to San Quentin.
Om mani pame hum. Om mani pame hum.
Om mani pame hum. Om mani pame hum...
Agent Hotchner, thank you for coming.
This is Agent Jareau.
Hi. Good to meet you.
Have a seat.
Are those prayer beads?
Uh, yes. I don't go anywhere without them.
They're bound with hair?
Well, uh, I exist on death row, Agent Jareau.
Hair is all I have left.
And these beads, they help me accept my fate
that I'm gonna be murdered for crimes I did not commit.
This prison's filled with men who didn't do it.
Why should we believe you?
Have you heard of desoxyn?
It's a pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine
used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.
In 2004, I found an internet black market that sold it,
and when I started popping those pills like candy, I was gone.
I would just hack in 100-hour stretches, I'd sleep for 4.
I was an addict...
Not a killer.
So you're saying desoxyn
caused you to sign a confession to 8 murders?
Yes.
Look, here's something you don't know.
The man who arrested me, detective Bob Cooper,
he found my pills and then he introduced me to the good stuff,
the I.V. stuff.
And the more prostitutes I confessed to killing,
based on information that he fed me,
the higher the dose.
And I never fully sobered up until last year
when I discovered buddhism, but by then it was too late.
No one would listen.
But the Star Chamber did.
That's their whole message, right?
"They died in vein"?
How are you communicating with them?
I'm not gonna tell you that.
I'm not gonna let you interfere
with work they're doing on my behalf.
Odd behavior from a supposedly innocent man.
You know what? I've howled for 10 years
against a system that wouldn't even notice me
until the Star Chamber embarrassed them,
and then it noticed.
I'm not gonna cooperate and help you find the Star Chamber.
They're the only ones fighting to keep me alive.
So, how long ago did you retire, detective?
Oh, about 4 years.
You know, they say that you never turn off being a cop, but, uh,
I sure did.
Detective Cooper, we need to ask you a few questions
about the Sam Russell case.
Oh, my pleasure, yeah. It's good to answer questions
that are gonna put this guy in the gas chamber
instead of taking him out.
Someone claims that you fed Russell drugs
in order to get the confession.
Who? Who said that?
It doesn't matter who.
Oh, I bet it was those, uh, jackass computer nerds.
Is it true?
No, of course not.
I'd be willing to swear on a stack of bibles if you want me to.
It's not true.
You know, it's interesting how much you can tell
about a person by what they choose to read.
This shelf, for instance,
is devoted to Ayn Rand, christopher Hitchens,
Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris.
So?
You're an atheist.
And your comment about the stack of bibles
is a linguistic tell.
You're overcompensating, which mean you're hiding something.
I--
That photograph you were admiring there--
you want to know who I'm shaking hands with?
I don't care.
Well, I'll tell you. It's my union rep,
Local 151. Now, here's what's gonna happen.
When you people leave here,
I'm gonna get on the phone with my good buddy there
and he's going to issue a press release
saying that detective Bob Cooper
has devoted his entire career to justice.
So why is the FBI
keeping a serial killer who he caught
from receiving the justice that the brotherhood of police
fight and die for every day?
I can't tell you how much we need your help.
Your network security is tight.
It has to be. We're in hacker central here in silicon valley.
We ramped up after we digitized all our case files,
but whoever did this left a bomb behind.
A bomb?
He means a Trojan Horse,
so whenever you try to source the hack,
pieces of the code self-delete,
which means the Star Chamber
has pretty much all of the Sam Russell file.
You've seen this before? Because it took our backup file
and the district attorney's.
Yeah, I may have helped design this,
back when I was a sort of bad guy.
But I'm gonna see what I can do to rebuild it.
Let me know if you need any help.
Yeah, I am not rebuilding jack.
Whoever did that is amazing.
Come on, not as amazing as you.
Pretty amazing.
And he started with an SQL injection.
That's no big deal.
You could download a patch to fight it off,
but it's the patch that contains the Trojan Horse.
Like taking a flu shot filled with cancer.
Exactly.
Maybe I could find a clue in the code
to figure out who the culprit is.
Just do that thing that you do, baby girl.
Ok. We have to stop this.
Stop what?
Derek, the FBI is organizing seminars on the way we've talk.
So what?
So it's embarrassing.
Not to me.
I am not about to change how I am with you
because Bob in payroll doesn't get the joke.
Look, I like the way we talk.
Just can we cool it for a bit, please?
Fine.
Only because you're asking.
However, but before we play this little game of yours,
I want to know what this Blunderguff thing is.
That is a conversation between JJ and I that I will--
What?
What's wrong?
What?
I have to talk to Hotch.
This is the client's address?
Yeah, this is it?
Huh. Homey.
Whenever a guy books a two-fer, you have to wonder.
Not me. I tell the sitter I'll be home early,
because they book us for all night
and then we're out the door after 15 minutes.
20, tops.
Welcome.
Ok. We need to have a little primer on hacking.
Because I think I've figured out the member of the Star Chamber
who's behind all this.
And who is he?
I'm gonna take a guess based on the signature.
Hackers have signatures?
Sometimes. Usually it's a message in the code
to let other pros know, hey, this one was me.
And in this case, the signature matches the DOJ hack,
and it is, "Happy fun meow meow."
Sorry, what?
Happy fun meow meow.
What the hell does that mean?
It was Garcia's signature before she joined the BAU.
None of this has been an accident.
Getting us to review the case,
leaving that clue,
and there is only one man old enough
and has the kind of crazy kung fu to do it.
His name is Shane Wyeth, and he is my old...
hacking mentor.
Do you think you can get him to come to the table?
We need the file to reexamine Russell's confession.
If Russell's innocent, we'll need it for clues
to find the identity of the real killer.
That's not gonna be easy.
Shane and I ended on terrible terms.
He was more than just a mentor, wasn't he?
Please, let me go.
Please...
Don't. No--
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Hold my--hold my hand.
My lawyer told me the news this morning.
Two more prostitutes. One stabbed, one strangled.
It's a tragedy.
A tragedy that helps your case.
I need to talk to Shane Wyeth.
He's the member of the Star Chamber.
You've been in contact with, correct?
That depends.
Are you gonna arrest him?
No.
How can I trust that?
Because I don't think you did this.
And I need the file that he stole in order to prove it.
So how do I contact him?
Shane will speak with the Black Queen.
The Black Queen only.
Just set up an internet relay chat room,
and from there they can arrange a meeting on neutral turf.
There are millions if IRC channels. I need a name.
Hashtag Hail to the King.
You really think he's innocent?
I know he's hiding something,
but I couldn't let him know that.
Ok, we got what we needed. How do we play it to our advantage?
We don't. We can't.
We do it Shane's way.
No, Garcia, it's too early to make that call.
Sir, I'm not happy about any of this,
but people are still dying, right?
All right, you arrange the meet and we'll deliver the profile.
At this point we've got two working theories about this case.
We need to give both of them equal weight.
The first is that unpleasant as it may be to admit,
Sam Russell was wrongly convicted
and the real killer has struck again.
If that's the case, this unsub is controlled enough
to stay dormant for 10 years.
But Russell's impending execution
has brought him back to the surface.
Dennis Rader, the BTK killer,
went dormant for 16 years.
But later sent letters
to the media claiming credit for his crimes.
And last night's murder could serve as a similar message to us.
The other theory is we have a copycat
and he's trying to cast doubt on Russell's conviction.
To copy the case this accurately,
the unsub would have to have access to the original case file.
And since the Star Chamber has that file,
we think he's one of their members.
Certain types of hackers thrive on the cachet of infamy.
This unsub wants to show his peers that he's so evil,
he can commit the murders that Russell didn't.
And whichever of these theories turns out to be correct,
the key to finding this unsub
is comparing last night's murder to 2004.
How are you gonna do that when we don't have the file anymore?
We have an expert working on it right now.
Testing.
Ok, keep going. I want to test the signal.
Tell me about the meet.
Uh, it's happening at a local access network gaming center.
It's a good place for hackers to hide.
All right, that's good.
I feel like I'm gonna barf.
Ok, hey. Hey, hey.
I'm gonna be in the van right outside.
If you get in trouble, I will be on you before you--
I will be there.
Wow. You were gonna marry this guy, weren't you?
No.
No, no.
No?
No.
Ok, then what?
Because I have never seen you like this before.
After my parents died, I went through this period
where I was even more comfortable than I am now
in front of a computer than in front of people.
You know, a computer can't surprise you
or hurt you or die without saying good-bye.
And...
Shane figured that out about me.
And he made me feel really...
Safe?
Yes. And he did it by telling me I was never going to die.
He recorded almost everything I said and I did.
So it was like I was gonna live forever.
That's kind of romantic, I guess.
I guess. Until you get in a fight.
And then it's like, would you please put down the freakin' camera
and can we talk like normal people, and...
You know, I'm stubborn.
Oh, yeah. Just a little bit.
No, but it was like we'd get--we would get in these fights,
and--and then...
He liked fighting, a lot.
He liked winning.
And I had become this person
that I never intended to be.
So I stopped being that person,
and when I stopped being that person, I couldn't be with Shane.
And I never looked back.
Good.
Because you've come a long way.
It's time.
Time for what?
Isn't it obvious, eyebrows?
I have to get into character.
Shane?
Shane!
需要信用卡预授权
What?
I need another hour, Shane.
No.
Come on. Comp me 15 minutes.
Did you learn nothing from your date with your sister?
No means no.
Now, either give me your mom's credit card or get out.
Hey, Shane.- What's up?
What the hell, man? We just got knocked offline.
What do you mean?
What is going on?
She's back.
Very nice.
You...
You've lost weight.
You miss me?
No.
OK.
Why don't you, uh...
prove it?
I'm going to kiss you.
OK.
Thank you.
We have a lot to talk about.
Yes, we do.
So, we dug into both victims' lives.
They worked for separate agencies
but went freelance about two months ago.
Not a surprise.
We've seen how the internet has revolutionized the sex industry.
It's taken it off the streets
and allowed the women to control their own clientele.
That could be how the unsub crossed paths with them.
We thought that, too, but when we looked
at cell and computer records, the data fields were empty.
For both women?
Well, if it was just one, we'd chalk it up to chance or luck,
but two's a pattern.
And if the unsub's good with computers,
he could have erased everything.
We need to dig deeper into their online lives,
match his expertise with our own.
Well, unfortunately, our expertise is in the field right now.
Just give us the file back.
You're asking me to cooperate with the FBI.
I am asking you to do the right thing.
This is not about proving whether Russell is innocent, OK?
Look, two more women died last night--
Yeah, I know. 'cause of that,
I should hand the keys to the car back to the morons
who crashed it in the first place?
I took the file to make you rebuild the case from scratch
because you and the genius squad
missed a couple kind of important things.
Like the silent partner.
You have no idea who that is, do you?
Can we stop?
Your team floated two killers.
There's been an inside man the whole time.
You completely overlooked him.
You're the FBI, for god's sake.
Can we stop? Shane, please, can we stop?
Can we just talk like normal people for a second?
Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, let's talk like normal people.
How's your mom?
She died.
7 years ago.
I'm so sorry.
I posted a thing.
I can't--
I made a deal with the FBI.
I'm not allowed to get in touch with you,
With guys like you.
Why did you do it? Why did you go to their side?
I got caught.
You got caught?
You walked in.
You walked in 'cause you were too scared to stay with me.
I wanted a different life, maybe.
Well, you got one, didn't you?
Baby girl.
You don't even know what that means.
I know the texts I saw.
And whoever this guys is, the one I assume you're sleeping with,
he did the impossible. He managed to take the strongest,
toughest woman I've ever met in my life
and he infantalized her.
We're not sleeping together.
Well, that makes it worse. That means you infantalized yourself.
Who are you?
'cause the woman I loved...
She's gone.
A little wine.
I am good. Thanks.
Can I use your bathroom?
Sure. Down the hall to the left.
What are you doing?
No. no, no, no--
No!
Then the M.O. was mixed?
Only one victim,
but he strangled her and then stabbed her.
It could be an evolution.
Or he's trying to cast more doubt on Russell.
Her name is Debbie Bloom.
She went freelance two months ago,
and when she did, all traces of her business vanished.
Exactly like the previous two victims.
What if we're thinking about the M.O. wrong?
What if the unsub didn't erase the data,
but the call girls were simply hiding it
from law enforcement?
And the unsub figured out a way to use it to his advantage?
Well, Blake found one potential lead.
It was the last client that Debbie kept
before she went off the grid.
Goes by the name of Mr. Smith.
Will Mr. Smith talk to us?
Well, once Blake promised that we wouldn't ruin his marriage.
She's bringing him in now.
Who's that?
Mr. Smith.
It's so unfair.
Going off the grid was supposed to make things safer for her.
The man we're looking for knew she was off the grid
and it's keeping us from finding him.
Can you help us figure this out?
I, uh, actually helped her set it up.
There's apps now.
Online calendars, phone calls over Wi-Fi,
Even payment through this thing called bitcoin,
where you can have it converted into cash.
Don't those still leave breadcrumbs on the internet?
It was all encrypted.
If she didn't log in every 12 hours,
all the data erases itself.
So it couldn't be used against her if she got arrested.
So how did you figure all this out?
Debbie found a post online.
Um, we looked at it so much, I bookmarked it.
Can I see?
It's one of those long posts with step-by-step instructions.
If this is how Debbie hid in plain sight,
it's a good bet that Gloria and Marguerite did, too.
Maybe the unsub wrote that in order to prey on his victims.
The unsub didn't write it.
Based on the verbiage, syntax, and organizational structure,
I can tell you who did.
Sam Russell.
Come on.
Take the cheese.
What's going on?
I was sick of being behind the eightball,
so I found a back door on Shane's work server.
Looks like he found you.
That's the point.
I wanted him to find me.
And now, invite him in,
and we start to play.
You found a blind spot.
I'm impressed.
Why are we here?
When we would fight...
this is how we made up.
So, figure, since this is the best way we communicated,
maybe I can use it to talk some sense into you.
Yeah, actually, uh,
I think this was the best way we communicated.
Remember?
I do.
I remember when you talking sense
sounded like this.
There is zero point in following the law,
because the whole thing is corrupt.
And nothing is going to make me happier
than to watch the whole stupid thing
burn to the ground--
The government, the police, the feds,
every shred of it.
Burn, burn, burn.
How's that feeling?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
Calm down.
You saw that.
Yes, I did.
He's jut trying to get under your skin.
It's working.
Forget about what he's doing and focus on why.
He's a narcissist, right?
He's a game player.
Garcia, those guys are easy to manipulate
because they always overplay their hand.
No. Not Shane. Shane does not lose.
He lost something 10 years ago, didn't he?
He doesn't care about Russell, Garcia.
He wants you.
He wants you to one last time say that he won.
OK. If that's true,
how do I use that against him?
Sit down.
Come on.
Just wait for his opening.
You'll know it when you see it.
You can do this.
I can do this.
I can do this.
OK, I'm really embarrassed.
Good job.
You embarrassed me.
That doesn't matter. Here's why.
I grew up, sort of,
and I figured out that the revolution isn't going to come
over a T1 line.
I have learned new tricks.
Who'd you learn them from? From him?
Derek, the FBI's organizing seminars on the way we talk.
So?
So it's embarrassing.
Not to me. I'm not about to change the way I am with you
because Bob in payroll doesn't get the joke.
I like the way we talk...
You've been following me this whole time?
Yep. You and supervisory very special agent Derek Morgan.
Are you surprised?
But really, honey, you chose this guy?
You chose a brainless, metrosexual
action figure?
That's his opening.
Yes, it is. Now tell me why.
Because the last time he said he didn't know who you were, but he does.
He sees us having a relationship
that he doesn't get to have anymore and it's driving him crazy.
I told him we're not sleeping together.
It doesn't matter.
His narcissistic brain won't accept
that we could ever be friends.
So he thinks he can beat me by beating us?
So what's your next move, baby girl?
New game.
Two teams--
BAU versus Star Chamber.
We see who can find the new killer first.
But we do it on an equal playing field.
Which means you give us the Sam Russell file back...
and we give you our profile.
When I win, what do I get?
When you log on to the DOJ website,
there'll be a picture of me
and super special agent Derek Morgan...
with shoes on our heads.
He just left the table.
Did he take the bait?
I don't know.
What's the shoe on the head mean?
Ah, it's an internet thing.
Hello.
I've got mail.
We got the file.
You know, I hate to admit it,
but the Star Chamber did an impressive job.
They took the police file
and annotated it with their own research.
Is there any other evidence? 'cause I'm not seeing anything.
There's one thing we missed.
Back in 2004, Russell had a silent hacking partner
in charge of money and infrastructure
who remained hidden in the shadows.
They think the silent partner committed the murders
and let Russell take the fall for it.
Two unsubs would explain it.
We profiled that 10 years ago.
What if the silent partner was also the killing partner?
Well, that would mean that
Russell admitted to 4 murders he didn't commit.
Why not just cut a deal and name the partner?
Because he'd still get life in prison.
It beats a death sentence.
Not if you think you can beat the system,
and hackers always think they can do that,
especially if you had help from the outside.
Then that's why the partner surfaced now.
This whole time we've been
trying to figure out which profile is right,
The dormant killer or the copycat. But the answer is both.
Ok, but how do we prove it?
If we can't, we're no better than the Star Chamber.
Yeah, hotch. I think we may have something.
Yeah, I wrote this post.
I told Shane to put it up on Reddit.
Why would you care so much about how prostitutes do business?
Because I think sex work should be safe and legal.
The internet can de-stigmatize it.
And make it easier for predators to prey on victims.
Well, I agree. That's why you should really catch that predator.
There's something else we need to discuss.
When we got the files back from the Star Chamber,
We noticed a detail about the strangulations we hadn't seen before.
What we noticed about the killer
is when he was choking out these women,
Their hair--their hair would collect around their throats,
like this.
And he would grip it so tight...
He would rip the hair out by the roots.
So, we realized the old killer's signature
that the new killer didn't copy...
was hair.
Your partner on the outside fed that to you,
and every time you got a lock of your victim's hair
it was a promise that your plan was still in motion
and that he'd get you off.
Well, instead, the two of you are going to die in here together.
Let me explain to you what's going to happen.
We're gonna go to the governor
and he's going to halt your execution
and withdraw the charges for the first murders.
And then we're going to retry you for the other 4 murders.
That's mine. You gotta-- give it back.
Give it back!
Stop! It's mine!
Come on.
It's ridiculous.
What is?
The FBI profile on the guy Sam Russell's in prison for.
How'd you hack that?
I didn't.
They gave it to me.
Really?!
What's it say?
Nothing. It's completely generic.
All they've got is the guy could be an underground hacker.
Which could be any of us.
That's good.
Good?
Yeah, good.
Because they'll think it's you.
What are you --
No...
Clear here.
Clear.
Yeah, Shane's car's here, he's not.
All right. Garcia may have another lead.
There's something hinky about some stuff Shane bought online.
There it is.
Oxycodone.
Would Shane use it recreationally?
No way. Shane's one of those people,
well, like his body is his temple.
He wouldn't take anything to pollute it.
The unsub must have bought this in Shane's name.
Where were the drugs sent?
To an address, in Shane's name,
in Silicon Valley that there's no way he could afford.
All right, Morgan, go, take Reid with you.
Garcia, I want you on site, too, scanning the networks.
Yes, sir.
No...
Oh, God, you used me.
Oh, Shane.
You wanted to be used.
You took my money,
and you hoarded my servers
for your little crusade.
And none of that
is free.
Even those women knew that.
And so...
now it's time for you
to be so overwhelmed with guilt
that you...
kill yourself.
FBI!
Drop the needle. Let me see your hands.
How much did you give him?
Figure it out.
Stand down.
Standing down.
Quick, pull up his shirt, Morgan.
Oh, my God.
Nothing.
Paramedics are on their way. You got anything else over there?
Norepinephrine. It might kill him.
Wait. Just wait.
Shane, I know you're in there,
and I know you can hear me.
Hey. I won, Shane.
And if you die on me,
I'm gonna tell everybody we know
I won.
Do it. Do it now.
You got lucky.
Yes, I did.
This is the one. This is the last --
Wait -- no, wait.
No...
That's the one. That's the --
Hold on. Ok, one more. I'm sorry.
Ok, I'm stopping.
We used to make fun of chicks like you.
No. You used to make fun of chicks like me.
This is who I always wanted to be,
and I was too afraid to tell you
because I didn't think you'd like me.
Do you ever miss her?
'Cause I do.
Take such good care of yourself, Shane.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
So...I have a confession to make.
You are not the first guy to call me baby girl.
Get outta here.
It's true.
It better not be that guy.
Oh, no. Uh-uh.
Actually, it was a different guy.
Ok, I'll bite.
How did this pretender to the throne
end up stealing my fire?
I'm going to tell you, but first,
I have to explain an explicit,
sexually inappropriate detail --
what a flarpy blunderguff is.
Ok. So, you need like an oil-based paint
and some charcoal
and some sort of food that you love,
I mean love, because you are gonna be with it...

But it's still allowed.
And I think you'll be happier for the trouble."
