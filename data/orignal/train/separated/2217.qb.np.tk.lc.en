prosecutor &apos;s last and final offer was 18 months .
we accepted it .
when do you have to surrender ?
tomorrow morning .
i love you .
forever ?
forever .
how you holding up ?
um , hanging in there .
what about adam ?
he &apos;s keeping his head down , doing his time .
why would gabriel cut a deal with shioma
just to turn around and kill him ?
because it was all a power play .
he was just biding his time , earning the yakuza &apos;s trust
until he could make his move .
he &apos;s got no one left to align himself with .
what do you think his next move is ?
what do you want ?
you guys mind if i get a selfie for my boy ?
knock yourself out .
my son &apos;s not gonna believe
the bennett brothers are in my cab .
martellus , you was his starting tight end in his fantasy team .
man , i don &apos;t know your son ,
but he sounds like the smartest kid on the planet .
hey , what about me ?
the seahawks &apos; vicious defense ?
actually , no .
you got to swing this cab to one of these local stores
so i can polish up , you know , the super bowl ring .
why you always got to go there ?
&quot; my ring , my ring , my ring &quot;
that &apos;s all it &apos;s been for the last two years with you .
hey , look , bro , we &apos;re the champ .
you always bring the backup .
you know , i got to say , love watching you guys in the pro bowl .
only bad thing about playing in the pro bowl here
is having to go home .
yeah , this island has that effect on people .
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna miss the traffic .
this is ridiculous .
you know what ? we could get out and walk from here .
come on , bro , let &apos;s go .
hey , here &apos;s a tip for your son
on how to win his fantasy football league .
迈克尔 · 本内特
here &apos;s a little something for yourself .
mahalo .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
what is that ?
oh , my god .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
i thought you went to go visit adam this morning .
i did .
okay .
everything all right ?
did you know gabriel waincroft went to
visit adam three months ago ?
who told you that ?
warden grier .
he was investigating a cyber breach
and found there was a visitor that had been deleted from their logs .
and when they looked at the video , they saw it was gabriel .
he used an alias to get inside .
why wouldn &apos;t adam tell you if gabriel came to visit him ?
i asked him the same thing .
he said he didn &apos;t want me to worry .
that if gabriel could have a sit @-@ down with him in prison ,
he could easily have him killed .
well , what did gabriel want ?
he told adam that he had taken care of shioma .
that it was only a matter of time
before all the other families would be out of his way .
but what he really needed to grow his business
was someone who understood how things operated .
he was offering him a job .
adam turned it down , though .
do you believe him ?
of course .
kono , if you believe him ,
then why are we here ?
hey ! h @-@ hold the elevator !
pregnant lady ! pregnant lady ! hold the elevator !
congratulations . when are you due ?
yeah i know . uncool .
uh , but i &apos;ve already been late to work three times this week .
oh , impressive , considering it &apos;s only tuesday .
look at that .
must be fate .
you know , some people might call it coincidence , but not me .
i &apos;m a big believer in the laws of probability .
you know , game theory .
steve nash .
i think you mean john nash .
and game theory is more about mathematical strategy
than probability .
you sure ?
yup .
totally just crashed and burned there , didn &apos;t i ?
passing yourself off as a pregnant woman
wasn &apos;t the strongest opening move .
strategically speaking .
ah , i see what you did there .
if it &apos;s any consolation ,
we &apos;ll probably never see each other again .
what a relief .
after you .
steve nash is a basketball player , you idiot .
are you following me ?
what ? no way .
i work here , so it &apos;s sort of like you &apos;re following me ,
if you think about it .
so much for never seeing each other again .
um , excuse me . i &apos;m sorry .
wh @-@ what are you doing here exactly ?
chunk !
jer @-@ bear .
so good to finally see you !
oh , guys .
i want you to meet my baby sister isabel .
isabel , these are my colleagues :
steve mcgarrett , danny williams
and lou grover .
uh , it &apos;s so good to finally meet you .
jerry &apos;s told me all about you .
yeah , you , too .
he &apos;s talked a lot about you , too ... chunk .
‭ chunk , huh ?
uh , i was kind of a chunky baby .
kind of ?
12 pounds is still a record in the ortega family .
12 pounds ?
should &apos;ve seen the size of her diapers .
okay , jer , i think they get the point .
uh , jerry tells us you &apos;re at ucla law .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s impressive .
congratulations .
thanks .
one more year , and she &apos;ll be counselor ortega .
how long you , uh , you gonna be in town ?
oh , just a few days .
i had some time over spring break
and thought i &apos;d come home and see my big bro .
i &apos;m sorry , can we hold on a second ,
back it up a few beats ?
i need a little clarity on something .
um , you two are related ?
like , biologically ?
oh , yeah , that &apos;s eric .
we &apos;ve met .
yeah , this is my nephew .
maybe not biologically ;
we &apos;re gonna do some tests and find out .
cold , uncle d.
uncle danny . okay ? okay ? okay ?
look , i just said what we &apos;re all thinking , right ?
you got somewhere to be or something ?
uh , isn &apos;t there some very important security ...
there you go .
thanks .
oh . you &apos;re not gonna believe it .
someone released an elephant from the circus last night ,
and hpd still hasn &apos;t found it .
i heard about that on the news .
anyone hurt ?
thankfully , no .
normally , we don &apos;t work the ace ventura beat ,
but hpd asked us to help out ,
since the elephant &apos;s a danger to the public .
i &apos;m gonna make a bold prediction :
somebody grabbed this elephant , okay ?
nothing that big ever disappears into thin air .
maybe we should call tsa .
you know , see if david copperfield is on island .
you know , &apos; cause he &apos;s an illusionist .
no , we get it .
damn , i &apos;m having a rough morning .
hey , eric , why don &apos;t you , uh , why don &apos;t you
go to your office and scrub that footage ,
see if you can help us i.d. a suspect ?
absolutely .
i &apos;m on it .
all right , well , we &apos;re off to the batcave .
gonna show isabel where the real magic happens .
nice to meet you .
and off they go down to the basement .
you got to admire his enthusiasm .
oh , come on , mcgarrett .
you know you need to go on and give homeboy his badge .
you nuts ? this guy believes in aliens .
you want to give him authority over sane people ?
i didn &apos;t say give him a gun .
mcgarrett .
yup , we &apos;re on the way . danny .
wait up , guys !
jerry , what are you doing here ?
thought you were giving isabel a tour of the batcave .
well , i was , until i heard
we had a murder victim at universal exports .
wasn &apos;t gonna miss this .
why ?
come on . you &apos;ve heard of area 51 ?
the bermuda triangle ?
the mob cemetery under giants stadium ?
what do these all have in common ?
the whack jobs that believe in them .
okay , let me put it this way .
if you &apos;re gonna make a list of
totally awesome places to visit before you die ,
universal exports would be at the top of that list .
why is that ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
i &apos;m not .
jerry , just tell us ,
tell us what you &apos;re talking about .
why is this place so awesome ?
no spoilers . you &apos;ll thank me later .
hey , guys , we &apos;re in here .
it looks pretty amazing so far .
who is he ?
david makana . he &apos;s the overnight security guard .
his body was discovered this morning when
the daytime guard came in for his shift .
c.o.d. is a close @-@ range gsw to the back of the head-- no witnesses .
all right , this guy &apos;s gun is still in his holster .
whoever did this must have got the jump on him .
or maybe he knew his attacker . what else do we know ?
well , makana &apos;s retinal scan was used to
access the facility at 11 : 32 p.m.
we &apos;re thinking our perp used him to get inside ,
then executed him .
we got any idea what these guys were after ?
no , ceo is on his way down to talk to us now .
so far , everyone we &apos;ve talked to hasn &apos;t really given us much .
makes sense .
they don &apos;t want us to know what they &apos;re working on here .
you &apos;ve been here before , jer ?
no , he wishes he had though .
come on , guys , this is simple math .
who employs round @-@ the @-@ clock armed security
and biometric entry for an export business ?
this place is a front for a top @-@ secret defense contractor .
we &apos;re talking next @-@ gen tech ,
highly @-@ classified q branch stuff .
you know , he &apos;s got a point .
mahalo , chin .
sorry to keep you waiting .
i &apos;m clark brighton , the ceo here .
i was hoping to provide you with security footage from last night ,
but our system was hacked .
the cameras were deactivated .
whoever hit us knew what they were doing .
okay , chin , why don &apos;t you get that data over to csu .
have them scrub it , see if they can find the source of the breach .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
my cyber team already attempted to track down the source .
unfortunately , it originated on the tor network .
it &apos;s impossible to trace .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. brighton , what did you say you do here again ?
look , i want to be helpful , but ...
i &apos;m not at liberty to discuss that .
what i can tell you
is that something very valuable was stolen from us last night .
look , we know you &apos;re not an export company ,
so why don &apos;t you just save us the double @-@ talk
and tell us what was taken .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t tell you that unless you sign this .
confidentiality agreement .
nice signature .
without a signature , they can &apos;t forge it .
i &apos;m sorry , but can i see your badge ?
uh , mr. ortega is actually a special consultant with our task force .
unfortunately , i can &apos;t allow him through without credentials .
you see ?
this is why i need a badge .
jerry , it &apos;s not the time .
it &apos;s certainly not the venue , okay ?
well , at least tell me one thing .
what does this really do ?
it writes .
follow me please .
oh , you &apos;re good .
over the past two years ,
we &apos;ve been designing a prototype tactical suit
for the u.s. military .
this is a scale representation of what was stolen .
when is this thing gonna be combat ready ?
the suit &apos;s fully functional , commander .
our plan is to have it in theater within the next three years .
what does something like this cost ?
we &apos;ve spent $ 80 million developing it .
and not to sound too hyperbolic ,
but it is the holy grail of next @-@ gen weapon defense .
okay , well , then why only one guard to protect it ?
an export company with too large a security presence
would draw unwanted attention .
anonymity is our best defense .
what are the suit &apos;s capabilities ?
the suit &apos;s made of a liquid armor ,
which hardens when hit .
this protects the soldier from lethal impact .
it also monitors vitals , provides sensor cues ,
and enhances the soldier &apos;s overall metabolics .
something that sophisticated has also got to have a tracking device .
it does , but it was disabled .
okay , well , only someone with knowledge of that suit
would know how to do that .
that &apos;s correct .
how many people know about this thing ?
between investors , developers and technicians ,
maybe 20 .
all right . we &apos;ll need a list of those names .
whatever i can do to help .
this suit &apos;s worth $ 80 million .
whoever stole it is looking to get paid .
or they &apos;re looking to use it .
i think we should assume they &apos;re gonna use it .
how do we stop it ?
you can &apos;t .
you saw the test .
the suit &apos;s made with zero vulnerabilities .
it &apos;s indestructible .
great .
so we &apos;re chasing iron man .
so , i go through this list of names that brighton gave me ,
and this guy goes right to the top of the list . here .
that is hugh foster .
foster was on the r &amp; d team for the suit .
eight months ago , they catch this genius shopping around
specs of the suit to rival companies .
he avoids jail time by taking a plea deal ,
but according to his financials ,
he got wiped out with legal fees
and he hasn &apos;t had a job ever since .
okay , so we got an ex @-@ employee who &apos;s pissed off .
not only does he have insider knowledge of the suit ,
but he &apos;s also financially motivated .
i will bring him in .
here it is .
pretty rad , right ?
very rad , jer .
i &apos;m really happy for you .
well , i figured it was about time i got out of mom &apos;s basement .
that and she moved to maui .
yeah , that did kind of force my hand .
makaha beach .
yeah , you remember that place ?
of course .
dad used to take us there on the weekends .
remember he bought you
that metal detector for your birthday ,
and you thought you found an alien time capsule .
okay , to be fair , i was only eight years old ,
and i &apos;d never seen a beer keg before .
dad loved that spot .
yeah , a couple times , he wrote me a doctor &apos;s note
and we went there on a school day .
i didn &apos;t know that .
neither did mom .
i miss him a lot .
yeah , me , too .
he &apos;d be so proud of you .
oh , look , jerry , there &apos;s something really important
i need to talk to you about .
sure , what is it ?
hold on one second .
okay .
special consultant jerry ortega . how can i help you ?
hi , eric .
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
sorry , sis , duty calls .
don &apos;t worry about it . we can talk about it later .
you sure ?
absolutely .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
again .
i told you , i had nothing to do with the suit going missing .
how stupid do you think i am ?
you are definitely stupid enough to get caught ,
uh , trying to sell plans to a rival company .
which is exactly why i would never steal it .
since i &apos;d be the obvious suspect .
i mean , it took you all of , what ,
an hour to get to me ?
where were you last night at around 11 : 30 p.m. ?
movies .
i caught a late showing at the cinezone in mililani .
you got anybody to back that up ?
no , i went alone .
i don &apos;t have many friends these days
since brighton ruined my life .
okay , so what you &apos;re saying is that you have no real alibi ,
but plenty of motive .
look , i made a mistake .
i almost went to jail for it .
you really think i &apos;d risk everything a second time ?
for $ 80 million , yes , i do .
if i was sitting on that kind of payout ,
you think you would &apos;ve found me
on my couch watching the price is right ?
if it wasn &apos;t you ,
it was somebody you tried to sell those specs to .
all right ? so what you &apos;re gonna do
is you &apos;re gonna give us a list of the names
of all the people you tried to sell them to ,
anybody you mentioned it to ;
i don &apos;t care if it was a date you were trying to impress .
i &apos;ve been going through the footage .
turns out , the elephant escape
was actually a botched kidnapping .
somebody was trying to rescue the animal from the circus .
i did get a pretty good screen @-@ grab
of one of the people involved .
that &apos;s great .
but why are we whispering ?
because .
look at this .
it &apos;s the only image we have of the perpetrator .
they &apos;re very aware of the cameras , very prepared .
until the part where the elephant got away .
great , but i thought you said you got a clear picture of him .
i did .
right around the time dumbo was rampaging down kalakaua ,
i found this .
same exact cargo truck pulls up on kuhio .
and look who &apos;s driving the truck .
your sister .
who else knows about this ?
nobody .
yet .
but , jerry , i have a responsibility to five @-@ 0 .
you know this . i got to tell them .
eric , i &apos;m just begging you to hold off .
i know my sister ; this isn &apos;t like her .
just give me a chance to talk to her
and find out what &apos;s going on .
maybe i can buy you some time .
how ?
my computer crashed .
thanks .
well , foster &apos;s alibi checks out .
he was at the movies at the time of the break @-@ in .
all right , so this exonerates foster .
what about the companies he gave us ?
still in the process of clearing them ,
but i got to tell you the truth ,
i don &apos;t think any of them are involved either .
why ?
i talked to the department of justice , okay ?
they handled foster &apos;s plea deal .
when foster started naming names ,
the doj started making pen registers and wiretaps
on any and everybody that was attempting to buy that suit .
if it had been one of these other companies ,
justice would have known .
so , what ? we &apos;ve just exhausted our entire list of suspects ?
i &apos;m afraid so , partner .
no .
no , w @-@ we got to be missing something .
that suit didn &apos;t just get up
and walk out of universal exports on its own .
he &apos;s still inside .
make any demands yet ?
radio silence .
you got anybody in lockup ?
not since last night .
then what the hell does he want ?
duke , who &apos;s he got with him ?
that &apos;s david atowa .
he &apos;s our property clerk , works in the evidence room .
tell your men to stand down .
there &apos;s no way they &apos;re gonna stop this guy .
stand down .
i repeat ,
hold fire .
my name is commander steve mcgarrett .
i &apos;m with five @-@ 0 .
cease fire ! cease fire !
do not engage ! do not engage !
we &apos;re just gonna let him go ?
we got to let him go .
you try to stop that guy , you &apos;re gonna lose that officer .
all teams , stand down .
target is free to go .
standing down .
roger that .
yes , this is commander steve mcgarrett .
i need an immediate satellite realignment
and grid coverage on my position .
target is a black suv leaving my location now . grover ?
yeah .
copy that . thank you .
get chin and kono down here , process the scene .
i want to know exactly why this guy came here ,
exactly what he wants .
all right .
duke , we &apos;re gonna get officer atowa back , okay ?
look , i tried to tell you ,
but you kept getting called away .
well , obviously you didn &apos;t try hard enough !
and what the hell were you thinking ?
i was thinking about saving that poor elephant &apos;s life .
oh , so you decided to kidnap her ?
look , a few years ago , i got involved with an activist group ,
animals without chains .
we help relocate animals that are being abused .
so this is what the whole trip was about .
had nothing to do with seeing me .
jerry , of course i wanted to see you ,
but mazie needed my help .
mazie ?
yes .
the plan was to relocate her to a sanctuary in thailand .
she &apos;s supposed to be halfway around the world right now ,
and everything was going fine until ...
till you forgot you were dealing with a 6,000 @-@ pound wild animal !
a car alarm went off as i was leading her into the truck .
it spooked her .
this has never happened to me before .
before ?
how many times have you done something like this ?
enough to know that it &apos;s worth the risk .
these animals are emotional , sensitive creatures .
you know , they don &apos;t deserve to be kept in captivity
and exploited for profit .
okay .
on principle , i agree with you .
but you broke the law , isabel ,
and now that elephant is loose somewhere on the island .
actually , no .
it isn &apos;t .
jerry , i &apos;d like you to meet mazie .
mazie , this is my brother jerry .
hello .
how &apos;d you get her here ?
it wasn &apos;t easy .
okay , look , i was able to buy you a few hours
before five @-@ 0 finds out you &apos;re behind all this ,
but they &apos;re gonna find out .
which is why you need to return mazie to the circus ,
and then we can figure out some legal way to get her out .
it &apos;s not that easy , jer .
it &apos;s almost impossible to get these animals
out of the hands of the circus .
and when it does happen , it takes years of litigation .
meanwhile , she &apos;s living in terrible conditions
and being abused by her handlers .
yeah , but what about law school ?
everything you &apos;ve been working for ?
you could go to jail for this , izzy .
i know that , but look at what these people did to her .
and that &apos;s just the visible abuse .
imagine all of the emotional scars she has .
look , remember when we were kids
and mom and dad got us tickets to go to the circus ,
but we never went ?
of course . we were crushed .
there was no tsunami warning that day .
the real reason we didn &apos;t go was because ,
after years of abuse , tyke the elephant
broke out of her cage the day before the show .
hpd had no choice .
they shot and killed her .
they were trying to protect us from the truth .
later on , i found out what happened ,
and it always stuck with me .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
and that &apos;s why i need your help .
what can i do ?
mazie was supposed to be on a ship last night .
i was able to convince the captain
to give me until midnight tonight .
but if she &apos;s not on the boat by then ,
they &apos;re gonna leave without her .
problem is
i had to ditch the transport truck
because i knew that hpd would be out looking for it .
so you need a new truck .
i know i &apos;m asking for a lot .
but i can &apos;t let her go back to that life , jerry .
i just can &apos;t .
it &apos;s a miracle no one got hit .
it &apos;s not a miracle .
if he was here to kill police , he would &apos;ve .
this is where he entered , took the hostage .
he was looking for something .
and he made sure we wouldn &apos;t be able to see what it was .
yeah , well , whatever it was ,
he was willing to take on a whole army of cops to get it .
let me just get this straight so i &apos;m clear .
you tell swat to stand down ,
but you think that us , with a couple of pistols
and a righteous disposition ,
we &apos;re gonna take this guy down ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s right ?
what are you , what are you , nuts ?
this @-@ this man that we are chasing
is wearing an indestructible suit
that not even your big , dumb head could penetrate .
right .
you got a plan ? you want to tell me what your plan is ?
sure . soon as i figure it out ,
you &apos;ll be the first to know . how about that ?
faster . stay close to the shoulder .
somebody jumped out of the car .
where is he ?
he went that way .
he could be anywhere .
i &apos;ll call hpd .
how &apos;s officer atowa ?
he &apos;s okay . he &apos;s lucky to be alive .
you have any idea what our suspect was after ?
no , he was taken after the evidence room break @-@ in ,
so he has no idea .
what about you ?
i ran the plate on the suv that the suspect was driving .
it was reported stolen this morning .
so i just got off the phone with duke .
after a thorough inventory check ,
hpd discovered what our suspect was after :
a beretta m9 .
it &apos;s a key piece of evidence
in the murder case against luke waiola ;
he &apos;s on trial right now .
hpd &apos;s been trying to put that guy away for a long time .
right , and that beretta is the first piece of hard evidence
ever linking him to a crime .
chin , when was that beretta
supposed to be presented in court ?
tomorrow .
without that gun , waiola walks .
well , i can assure you my client had nothing to do
with the theft of the prototype suit or that beretta .
okay , uh , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s fine .
we think , uh , maybe he wasn &apos;t behind it ,
but he had something to do with it
and knows who it was .
as a matter of fact , we &apos;re pretty sure your client
was the first person contacted after that gun was stolen .
you have any evidence to support these claims ?
yeah , we do . we do .
we have a wire in the amount of $ 10 million .
the money was transferred an hour after the gun was stolen
from one of waiola &apos;s offshore accounts
to one of his shell corporations that you , of all people ,
have access to .
so , uh , i &apos;m thinking either he was trying to get you
to give out early christmas bonuses ,
or , um , he was actually interested in purchasing that beretta .
right . whoever did this gave your client
the opportunity to buy a mistrial , okay ?
there &apos;s no gun . there &apos;s no case .
so why don &apos;t you tell us everything you know ,
and save yourself the trouble of going to prison .
you do that . you have my word . we will protect you .
i was contacted this morning .
caller said , for $ 10 million ,
he could make that gun disappear .
otherwise , he was gonna put it right back where he found it .
all right , when &apos;s the exchange ?
in one hour .
you sure he &apos;s your brother ?
since the day i was born .
what are you saying ?
dna . it &apos;s a great mystery .
no offense , brother .
none taken , if you do me this favor .
i &apos;m listening .
you still got that truck you used to haul around
the shave ice carts in ?
maybe .
well , a buddy of mine needs to tow
his catamaran down to the docks ,
and i was hoping i could borrow it .
have it back to you by morning .
you &apos;re lying , jerry .
what ? i &apos;m not .
just like when you were on my payroll .
you asked me for the day off to take your appendix out .
i knew you were lying then ,
just like i know you &apos;re lying now .
okay , fine , the truck &apos;s for me
and it &apos;s not exactly a catamaran .
it &apos;s smaller , but only by a little .
it &apos;s for a friend .
he &apos;s flying tonight and he &apos;s a very anxious traveler .
uh , you understand , this is a highly unusual request .
i know , and normally i wouldn &apos;t ask you for this kind of favor ,
except his doctor &apos;s out of town ,
and he desperately needs a sedative
or else he won &apos;t be able to fly home and visit his sick mother .
and i think you understand
that i tend to not give out prescriptions
due to the fact 100 % of my patients are dead .
well , then here &apos;s a chance to help someone who &apos;s alive .
well , i hate to deprive a son from visiting his ill mother .
okay .
in order to administer the correct dosage ,
i &apos;ll need to know how much your friend weighs .
about ... 6,000 pounds .
we got movement .
either he likes wearing that suit ,
or he knew something was gonna happen .
boss , i got a clean shot of the gas tank for
a concussion play ,
but that makes the lawyer collateral .
other than that , i have zero vulnerabilities .
stand down .
steve , we already lost him once .
now that he has what he wants , he &apos;s gonna disappear for good .
yeah , but what choice do we have
as long as he &apos;s wearing that suit ?
we got to let him go .
not this time .
that suit may have made you invincible .
didn &apos;t make you very smart .
son of a bitch .
it &apos;s foster . i thought you said he had an airtight alibi .
all right , let &apos;s go , iron man .
mazie should have a peaceful journey .
i really appreciate this , max .
and everyone else &apos;s help .
yeah , anytime .
it &apos;s time .
feels pretty good to help an animal in need , doesn &apos;t it ?
better sanitize that truck fully
before you turn it back to me , brother .
mahalo nui loa .
i &apos;m proud of you .
evidence . to be returned .
here &apos;s the thing , i was thinking that we keep it .
we say that it disappeared .
wouldn &apos;t be the first time , right ?
what do you think ?
what are you gonna do with an $ 80 million piece of hardware ?
i &apos;m gonna wear it .
you &apos;re gonna wear it ?
yeah .
okay .
right ? &apos; cause this thing is , you know ...
it &apos;s completely mcgarrett proof .
it &apos;s been designed for your partner to wear .
oh , we &apos;re doing that .
still with that ?
six years .
since the day i met you , you &apos;ve been telling me
i &apos;ve been trying to kill you .
what &apos;s your point ?
what &apos;s my point ? my point is this is getting old .
you &apos;re very much alive .
you &apos;re very much alive , which means i have your back .
i &apos;ve always had your back .
so what are you talking about ?
now return this to universal exports before you break it .
it &apos;s indestructible , you idiot .
oh , perfect timing . i was just about to come to see you .
oh , i &apos;m glad i could save you the trip . what &apos;s up ?
do you know who else
used the &quot; i was at a movie alibi &quot; ?
lho .
lee harvey oswald .
he ducked into the texas theatre
right after he and associates killed jfk .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure the warren commission
would disagree with some of this , but okay .
okay , well , just like the &quot; multiple shooter &quot; theory ,
i can also explain how hugh foster
was in two places at the same time .
check this out .
wait for it .
what am i looking at ? i @-@ i don &apos;t get it .
the movie showtimes .
they &apos;re from last week .
foster hacked into the movie theater surveillance system
and replaced the footage of him going to the movies
with the night of the murder .
nice work , jerry .
badge @-@ worthy ?
no . patience .
oh , what &apos;d you come down to see me for ?
oh , i was just gonna tell you about this thing that happened .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s crazy .
hpd found a trough and a bunch of hay ,
uh , in paradise park .
apparently , it was a temporary pen for that missing elephant .
interesting .
you don &apos;t know anything about that , do you ?
me ? no , why ? what ? of course not .
yeah , i @-@ i didn &apos;t think you did .
oh , i got you something , too .
this is for you and isabel .
circus tickets .
‭ - yeah .
awesome .
there &apos;s no elephant in the show this year ,
but i hear the rest of it &apos;s pretty good .
am i going to jail ?
&apos;cause i was kind of hoping that the whole immunity
and means deal would apply to me , too .
good night , jerry .
is that a yes or a no ?
solomon tuasopo ?
officer kono kalakaua . five @-@ 0 .
i know who you are .
then you know my husband is adam noshimuri .
yeah .
something i can help you with ?
i know you were the guard on duty
when gabriel waincroft came to visit adam .
you gave an official statement that you didn &apos;t know who he was .
but i find that pretty hard to believe ,
considering that gabriel was an inmate at halawa
and you &apos;re a guard there .
there are over 1,000 inmates there .
you think i remember every one of them ?
gabriel paid you to let him in , didn &apos;t he ?
i think we &apos;re done here .
gabriel offered adam a job .
i want to know what his answer was .
if you want to know , you should go ask your husband .
