We're worried about you.
Why?
Have you been taking pills to stay awake?
The shadow in the picture is you?
Why didn't you tell us before?
There was always a part of me
that wondered if that was my fault.
You're just getting out of a relationship.
I'm completely out, it's done.
I wish you could have told me what was really going on,
instead of me finding out this way.
This is for you.
My job is especially hard when you realize
that you've turned innocent people into collateral damage.
Alison is running out of money
and Shaun is the only one who knows how to reach her.
You knew Alison.
I was writing a book about her.
That's what I was to you? I was research?
I swear, I will burn this.
No, I want to know what was worth destroying everything
we had for.
Did you actually read any of this book?
A few pages.
Bits and pieces.
Ezra knew who I was before we met.
He knew who all of us were.
And he knew Alison too.
So he admitted to being in a relationship with her?
Yeah, a brief one.
Then he must be Board Shorts.
Well, Ezra didn't try to kill Alison.
His whole book is trying to piece together who did it.
How is he gonna do that
when the police can't even figure it out?
I don't know.
He has a theory though.
And? What is it?
He thinks that one of us did it.
You're kidding, right?
Well, now we know it's a work of fiction.
Which one of us is he trying to pin it on?
I didn't get that far.
You didn't think to ask?
Why?
We know that that's not true.
Just because he wrote a book doesn't mean he's not "A."
You know, he could be using it as a way to place the blame on
one of us and keep suspicion off of him.
No, he doesn't need to do that.
He knows that Ali's alive.
But he didn't know that when he started writing the book.
Guys, listen, Ezra's not "A."
He's a writer who found a great opportunity
to make a name for himself and he used me.
He used us.
So wait, what are we saying,
that all of that stuff in that room in Ravenswood,
that was just research for his book?
He's been working on it for years.
Well, we've seen the surveillance equipment,
so we know he's been watching us.
He's probably just hoping that we'd lead him to Alison,
so he could finally get his big ending.
If he's been watching us, then he has to know about "A."
I mean, how could he sit back all this time
and not do anything to help you?
It's simple.
He never really loved me.
You all right down there?
I'm a bit jet-lagged.
I just got back from Europe.
So do you go to Hollis?
Just graduated.
I'm gonna start my first teaching job.
I love this song.
B-26.
What's your major?
Well, I'm leaning toward English.
That's what I'm teaching.
And I write, too.
But and so far it's mostly personal, just for me.
Maybe you'd let me read something of yours?
Yeah, you'd really want to?
Yeah.
You're smart. You've traveled.
You have great taste in music.
I'd like to know more about you.
Morning, honey.
You want some coffee?
Yeah.
Black please.
Somebody going on a trip?
Yeah. Your mother and I spoke with Dr. Griggs this morning.
And he thinks it would be best that we get you some help
before the situation gets worse.
What kind of help?
He recommended a rehab facility in Philly.
Rehab?
I don't need to go to rehab.
Sweetie, I know that you called his office
impersonating me to renew your prescription.
I just needed help getting through a couple of tests.
We've heard that before, Spencer.
Look, I admit that I lost control.
Okay, but it's not like last time.
I've only been taking the pills for a few weeks.
And how were you even getting them without a prescription?
Just different people at school.
It's not that hard.
Please, I'm still applying to colleges.
I can't have Radley and rehab on my record.
All I'm asking is that you give me one chance
to get off them on my own.
Please.
But...
Okay.
We'll give you the chance.
On the condition that you take the withdrawal medication
under our supervision.
I promise.
And you come home immediately after school every day.
I will.
Thank you.
This is it, Spencer.
Next time there won't be a discussion.
I understand.
Hey, you.
Nice suit.
Do you have a job interview after school or something?
Not exactly.
Look, I've been meaning to call you and apologize.
It's just that I feel bad for
you know, what happened.
I should have never kissed you that day.
Don't sweat it.
Look, it's not that I didn't enjoy it.
It's just I wasn't in a place to start something--
Hanna, it's fine.
Okay, I get it.
I just-- I don't really have time to talk right now.
Why? Where are you going?
Court.
Court?
What did you do?
Nothing.
It's my dad.
Remember the thing with Wilden?
Well, he was blackmailing my dad for a reason
and now the cops are coming down on him for it.
This is all my fault.
I made you choose my family over yours.
You didn't make me do anything.
It was my decision.
And if I had to do it again, I'd make the same one.
I got to go.
How are you feeling?
Nauseous, achy, tired.
Other than that, fantastic.
Can I do anything?
No, thank you for asking.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Please.
Let's talk about anything other than me.
Shana called me this morning.
From Georgia?
Did she say why she left?
All she said was she needed me to drop
Ali's money off to a P.O. box in Wallingford
before 6 p.m. today.
Wallingford?
That's over an hour away.
Yeah.
I don't think that you should go.
Why not?
One minute she's here and in the next she's not
and then she's calling out of the blue
for an urgent money drop.
We know Ali needs the money, Spence.
What's going on?
We thought you were taking the day off.
Need to speak to Ezra face-to-face.
Well, wait, Aria.
I don't know where the truth begins and where the lies end.
Hey, listen.
We don't think you can get answers, okay?
And you certainly deserve them.
But confronting him at school is not the best idea.
Where is Ezra?
Do you mean Mr. Fitz?
Yeah. I need to speak with him.
Do you know where he is?
Mr. Fitz took time off for a family emergency.
Is there something I can help you with?
Oh, family emergency?
Right.
God, he's a liar and a coward.
Aria, wait.
I'm fine.
Aria, slow down.
I said I'm fine, Hanna.
Okay, let me take you home.
I come bearing gifts.
Cronuts.
What's that?
Haven't you heard?
It's all the rage, it's a part croissant,
part doughnut.
It's all trans fat.
That's disgusting.
Can I please come in?
I'm sorry that I ruined last night.
Last night isn't what I'm upset about.
It's not something that I'm proud of, Toby.
How can I help you, if I don't even know you're in trouble?
I get it, okay.
And I would be feeling the same way
but you don't have to worry about me.
I've got it all under control.
You look like crap.
Yeah, I feel like it, too.
Promise me, you will call me
if you get the urge to take pills again.
I'm done with that.
And thank you for my necklace.
Hey, stranger.
I was starting to think
I wasn't going to see you again until graduation.
I know, right?
We're in high school,
we shouldn't be this scheduled.
What are you doing after school?
I don't have practice today.
I have a few errands I've to run,
and then I've got to go and visit Aria.
She's having a family crisis.
Yeah, I heard she flipped out in Fitz's class today.
Yeah, yeah, she's been under a lot of stress at home,
but she'll be okay.
So can you slot me in?
Yeah, my parents are going out tonight,
so why don't I call you after Aria's
and we make dinner?
Great.
Do you always carry that much cash around?
It's a late birthday present from my grandma.
I need to deposit it.
It's on the list.
What is she, a stripper?
Why give you that much in cash?
She doesn't trust banks.
Her whole life savings has been stuck into coffee cans
and cookie jars.
Listen, I have to hand in my yearbook form
before sixth period.
But I will see you tonight.
Yeah.
Open up, Ezra.
Ezra?
Ezra?
I'm safe for the moment,
thanks to you.
But you can't tell anyone you helped me.
Promise me you won't.
Okay, I still don't know who I can trust.
I know this isn't what she expected to hear
but Mr. Hobbs is complicit in the crime.
So he gave Wilden a little money
for throwing business his way.
He didn't hurt anyone.
It's not a small thing, Hanna.
Look, he did it a few times and then tried to stop,
but Wilden wouldn't let him.
That's his version of the story.
When a cop wants to make your life miserable,
there's not much you can do.
Just ask my mom.
Yeah, I shouldn't be talking to you about this case.
But you're testifying today.
Right.
Because I'm the one that connected the money
in Wilden's safe deposit box to Travis's dad.
I need to get to court.
Okay, I'm not saying he isn't in the wrong.
But Wilden was a corrupt cop and a bully.
That has to count for something.
Don't you agree?
My job is to state the facts, Hanna,
not my opinion.
Today Aria told me she caught her dad
having an affair with a student last year.
Alison knew about the affair, too.
Aria and her friends blinded Jenna in a prank gone wrong.
Alison was the instigator.
Possible motive for her murder:
someone seeking revenge.
But who? A boyfriend?
Toby?
What's that?
A gift.
Guess it's better than a needle in the arm.
Don't give "A" any ideas.
I'll take these and throw them away.
No, I better.
I want to toss it far from this place.
You still up for Operation Money Drop later?
I can't let Ali down again.
Hey. Have you talked to Aria?
I texted her a while ago, but I haven't heard back.
Why?
I went to her house at lunch and she is not there
and she's not answering her cell phone.
I think I have an idea where she might be.
What the hell happened in here?
Oh, my God. Aria.
Hey, are you okay?
Every secret I told him about Ali
and about me and about you guys,
he wrote it down, it was all for his book.
Aria, if it were me, I would've burned this
whole place down.
Come on, we're gonna get you out of here, okay?
Come on.
Come on.
Wait, you guys.
This is some of the stuff
from Ezra's apartment in Ravenswood.
Shouldn't we take it with us?
Spencer, not now.
It's nothing we haven't seen before.
Can you grab Aria's bag?
Yeah.
Spencer, come on.
What are you doing here?
I just came to see how the sentencing went.
You didn't have to do that.
Look, I told you this isn't your fault, Hanna.
I know I didn't have to.
I wanted to.
So how'd it go?
Actually, much better than we hoped.
Really? Yeah.
That cop Holbrook, spoke up for my dad.
Said he was a decent guy,
pointed out that he had no priors.
He even reminded the judge
that Wilden didn't have the cleanest past.
Wow. So did they drop the charges?
No, but instead of jail time, they gave him probation,
community service.
God, that's great.
I'm really happy for you and your dad.
Oh, this is him.
We're going to go celebrate.
Can we talk more tomorrow?
Yes, yes, go, celebrate.
Thank you.
For what?
Just thanks.
绝对保密
Pope Private Eye.
Leave a message, we'll find you.
Depositing the money in your bank account, huh?
Paige.
What are you doing here?
You followed me?
I know you were lying about
your grandma and her coffee cans.
What is "A" making you do now?
This has nothing to do with "A."
Then who's the money for?
I wish I could tell you, okay, but I can't.
Can't or won't?
Can we not talk about this here?
I told you I'm going through something.
You've been going through something for weeks now.
There's a lot of money in that envelope, Emily.
What don't you want me to know?
What is A.D. Incorporated?
Give it back, Paige.
Not until you answer my question.
I told you, I can't.
Well, I can't let "A" continue to control you like this.
If you won't tell me what A.D. Incorporated is,
maybe the police will.
No, you can't take that to the police, Paige.
Why not?
Because somebody needs that money.
Who?
Last chance, Emily, I'm serious.
Wait.
The money is for Ali.
She's alive.
Are you feeling any better?
Worse, actually.
The more I think about it, the stupider I feel.
There had to have been signs.
How did I miss them?
Aria, no one thought he'd be capable of doing what he did.
He fooled all of us.
Yeah, but you're not the one who was sleeping with him.
And if it weren't for me,
he wouldn't know things about you guys.
Personal things that I trusted him to keep between us.
Aria, he wasn't just getting information from you.
Do you think that's how he found out Ali was alive?
The Grunwald tape?
Yeah, well, it makes sense.
I just-- I don't even know
how he would have gotten the tape
in the first place.
Have you eaten today?
Do you want to get some food?
No.
We can order in.
You can go pick up food, Hannah.
I'll be fine to be by myself for 10 minutes.
Are you sure?
Okay, but
no more torching Ezra until I get back.
I can't believe you've known all this time.
You never said anything.
I wanted to tell you, but she begged us not to.
If Alison's not dead, who's in her grave?
We don't know.
Does her family know she's alive?
The only people that know are the four of us,
Shana and "A."
Emily, if "A" knows that Ali's alive
and "A" is the one she's been running from,
then you're putting yourself in danger
by communicating with her.
Maybe.
Okay, but she needs us.
Ali used and abused you guys.
Why would you want to help her?
She regrets how she treated us.
Of course she's gonna say that.
She manipulates people to get what she wants.
She's not like that anymore.
She has faked her death for the past 2 years.
She's definitely still like that.
She's a sick person.
You need to let her family deal with this.
Well, we can't tell her family.
Then I will.
If you do, if you expose her to the world,
then you're basically handing her to "A."
Okay, the person she's been hiding from
for the past 2 years.
And if I don't, you continue to be a target.
If anything happens to Ali,
I'd never forgive myself...
or you.
Fine.
I won't say anything.
But you need to do one thing for me.
What's that?
Cut off communication with Alison.
No secret meetings,
no dropping off packages,
no interaction of any kind.
You can't be serious.
It's the only way I know you'll be safe.
Where are you up to in such a rush?
Oh, just picking something up for a friend in need.
You know, it's nice
that you care about your friends so much.
It's a great quality.
Don't lose it.
You know, I was gonna stop by your office tomorrow.
I was surprised to hear that you spoke up for Mr. Hobbs.
Well, that was the right thing to do.
Still. I mean, not a lot of people
would put themselves out there like that.
It's a great quality.
Don't lose it.
Seriously. Thank you.
Hanna.
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I just did that.
I'm sorry, I got to go.
CeCe told me she stopped by the DiLaurentis house
to talk to Alison the night she went missing.
When CeCe arrived, she witnessed a fight.
Hey!
Hey! This conversation isn't over.
It is over, Spencer.
And so are we.
Don't you walk away from me.
Damn it, Ali. I said, stop!
You're way out of your league, Spencer.
Am I?
Are you sure about that?
Why don't you put that thing down before you hurt yourself?
CeCe didn't tell anyone what she saw,
because Mrs. DiLaurentis paid her not to.
Mrs. DiLaurentis also witnessed the fight.
Hey.
Get some rest?
No, I was not resting.
I was just thinking about the night
that Ali went missing.
Spencer, you're supposed to be trying to relax.
Yeah, I can only remember pieces of the night
because I was taking the pills back then
and the first thing I remember
I was in here with Ali and we were fighting
and the next thing I know is that I'm out by the barn,
telling the girls that she's missing
and I thought I heard her scream.
Why can't you just stop dredging up the past
and focus on getting yourself better?
Is this the private investigator
you hired to follow Melissa?
Were you in my desk?
I told you to stay out of my office, Spencer.
Dad, did you hire him to follow Melissa or me?
Do you think
that I had something to do with Ali's murder?
What I think is that you're having a tough time
with your withdrawal.
And maybe we should just call the doctor.
Please don't do that.
Please don't make me feel any crazier than I already do.
Hi, Toby.
Hey, Mr. Hastings.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, you know, I think Spencer's just been
cooped up a little too long.
Why don't you guys go take a walk or something?
I don't want to take a walk, Dad.
I want to know the truth.
Just be you,
could be back in about an hour it will be great.
And I'll have dinner ready.
Yeah, let's go for a walk and get some fresh air.
Okay.
Okay what?
I'll stay away from her.
You mean it?
But I have to drop off that envelope.
Ali's depending on it and I gave her my word.
And then you're done?
Yes.
I'm doing this for you, Emily.
Because I love you so much.
Galassi Agency.
Hi.
Hi, my name is Victoria Blackwell.
I work at Rosewood High School,
where Ezra Fitz works.
Oh, hi.
You're in Pennsylvania, right?
Yeah, yeah, I am.
Actually we just found out about his book
and we wanted to throw him a little surprise party.
Do you know if there's a publication date
set for that yet?
No. But he's actually here now discussing it with Anna.
So if you call back tomorrow,
I should have more information then.
Toby.
Is Spencer here?
What?
I thought she was with you.
She was.
She asked me to go into the Brew and get some coffees
and when I turned around she was gone.
Spencer?
I need to talk to you.
Is everything all right?
Do you think that I hurt Ali?
What?
Do you and my father
have some kind of agreement to keep it quiet?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Don't lie to me.
Please.
Please, okay, I can't take any more lies.
You don't look well, Spencer.
I'm calling your parents.
Please, it's a simple question, okay?
Did you or did you not
see me standing with the shovel that night?
And if you did see me hurt Ali,
then why didn't you just call the cops?
You're hurting me.
I want you to leave...
now.
Aria?
Where are you going?
Ezra's moving forward with the book.
What?
He's meeting with his agent in New York right now
discussing a release date.
Release date? Can you just stop?
I cannot believe that I actually believed
he was going to destroy the book to save our relationship.
Now I know that everything he says
or has ever said is a lie.
It's a big fat lie.
Why are you going to Principal Hackett's house?
'Cause I'm telling him everything about me and Ezra.
What do you mean, you're telling him everything?
I'm not going to be the only one
that suffers from this, Hanna.
Aria, if you tell Principal Hackett
about your relationship,
Ezra is not just gonna suffer, he's going to go to jail.
Are you taking his side?
No, of course not.
Look, I'm not saying you shouldn't do this.
I just-- I want you to be clear about
what will happen if you do.
Oh, I'm clear.
Aria, look, if this gets out, it's gonna hurt you, too.
It'll be in the papers all over town.
Yeah. Do you think I really give a crap about that?
Look, this is gonna affect your family too.
Are you sure you want to do this?
You did the right thing.
Maybe I did. Maybe I didn't.
So I'll meet you back at your place?
No, I really want to be by myself right now.
Aria, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
Hanna, you are not listening to me.
I don't want your company, okay?
Look, I know what you're going through.
I've been through this myself.
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
I want to be left alone. Is that too much to ask?
Okay.
You beat me back.
Are you still up for cooking
or do you want to go out instead?
I'm not really that hungry.
It's getting kind of late.
I should probably check up on Aria.
All right.
Well, I'll just see you tomorrow I guess.
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
Are we okay?
I don't like being given ultimatums, Paige.
Neither do I.
Good night.
You need help, Spencer.
Hey, Mike let me in.
Are you going somewhere?
Yep.
Where?
No idea.
What do you mean, you don't know?
You're just gonna keep driving until you figure it out?
That's the plan.
I got to get out of here.
Hey, let's talk about this.
I don't want to talk.
Then I'll come with you.
I don't want that either.
Then what do you want?
I want for you to get out of my way, Emily.
