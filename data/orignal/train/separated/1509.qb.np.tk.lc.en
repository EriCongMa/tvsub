look -- in the hallway !
it &apos;s a bird ! it &apos;s a plane !
it &apos;s super @-@ out @-@ of @-@ breath .
happy halloween to you , too .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just --
i &apos;m really nervous about this closing argument today .
is it because you &apos;ve lost three cases in a row ?
whispering it doesn &apos;t make it any less painful .
sorry .
okay .
no , it &apos;s just that this case --
it &apos;s so hard to hold the jury &apos;s attention .
well , do you want to run your argument by me ?
could i ?
sure .
um , okay .
six years ago , alger equities
took investments
from municipal pension funds and private investors
and funneled all of that into offshore --
and i &apos;ve already lost you .
no . i was just thinking -- because it &apos;s halloween ,
what if you wore these in the courtroom ?
show the jury &quot; hey , i &apos;m playful . &quot;
cam , i &apos;m an attorney ,
not bugs bunny trying to hide on a train .
i &apos;m ready .
there &apos;s waldo !
i think i &apos;m gonna win the costume contest .
hey , now , honey , it &apos;s not important if you win .
it &apos;s just for fun . picture .
but it &apos;s more fun if you win .
no offense , daddy .
you know , lily &apos;s been letting me know recently
that she &apos;s feeling neglected .
i think it &apos;s because of all my football stuff .
that &apos;s why i went all out on her costume .
look how incredibly accurate it is .
where is that little guy ?
come on . come to me . come on .
here you -- here you go .
no matter how long he stares at it ,
读者要在一副混乱的图中找出主人公沃尔多
cam cannot find waldo .
it &apos;s crazy .
o @-@ once , he pointed to a barber pole ,
and we just gave it to him .
where is the little guy ?
he &apos;s right there .
how do you find it so ...
let &apos;s try these .
okay .
boys , what do you think about my costume for tonight ?
you look dynamite , honey .
ay , thank you . i am princess fiona .
so does that make me a prince ?
do i have to keep track of a crown all night ?
no , you &apos;re shrek , the ogre .
you mean that big green thing ?
nah , i don &apos;t want to walk around all night
with an ugly rubber mask .
no . you just need to paint your face green ,
and that &apos;s it .
you do this every time .
you go as a princess . i have to go as some freak .
you &apos;re beauty , i &apos;m the beast .
you &apos;re beyonce ? i &apos;m ... that guy .
well , you never want to go shopping with me for costumes ,
so i get what i want ,
and you are what comes with it .
well , this year , i &apos;m getting my own costume ,
and it &apos;s gonna be tough and manly --
maybe a cowboy or a construction worker .
you know that
that &apos;s what mitch and cam wore last year , right ?
damn it ! i cut my finger !
happy halloween .
no , really -- i cut myself . look !
that looks great .
what &apos;d you use to make the blood ?
a knife . i &apos;m actually hurt .
great production value , sweetheart .
i &apos;m impressed .
can &apos;t believe i &apos;ve got to go to work on halloween .
this blows !
don &apos;t worry.by the time you get home ,
awesomeland will be up and running .
claire &apos;s busy with work this year ,
so i &apos;m taking over the halloween duties .
my theme is awesomeland .
which includes anything phil finds awesome .
it &apos;s a pretty big umbrella .
big , pretty umbrellas -- those are awesome .
claire loves blood and guts and gore ,
but who says halloween has to be scary ?
everybody but you .
this is killing her .
at least something &apos;s dying .
court is now in session .
counselor , are you ready to deliver closing arguments ?
yes , your honor .
well , let &apos;s get --
wait . where is holly ?
sorry , your honor . my bus was late .
counselor , proceed .
o @-@ okay .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury ,
the details of this case are --
are complicated and technical ,
but they have a , uh , a tragic and profound effect on the victims .
uh , the , um ...
pensions were squandered , lives were destroyed ,
and careers , once so promising ,
were now ... ruined .
so , because of this marriage ,
you &apos;re basically third cousins with shakira .
i mean , we don &apos;t get the free tickets ,
but it &apos;s fun .
ay , dios mios . what is this ?
what &apos;s up , princess ? i &apos;m prince charming .
i can see that .
i got joe a donkey costume ,
and i got stella cat ears .
i just hope she doesn &apos;t chase herself .
ah , i get it -- because she &apos;s a dog .
i also found out that princess fiona
is supposed to wear a tiara , so here you go .
they had a whole bucket full of &apos; em .
i love it .
ay , and you look so handsome .
it &apos;s like those pictures of you in the navy .
i have an idea .
why don &apos;t we put joe down for a nap
and then we go and take a nap ,
but not the one we sleep --
i got it . i &apos;m in .
okay .
hey . i thought you had a big meeting .
i do , but i left my cellphone here .
i need it to read at stoplights
so i don &apos;t think about stuff .
i &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s ridiculous .
ohhh . honey , i don &apos;t think that fits .
it fits in awesomeland .
it &apos;s a magic hat .
i &apos;m gonna have this bunny jumping out of it .
you gonna put some blood on it ,
maybe dangle an eyeball ?
who hurt you ?
i &apos;m kidding .
i know it &apos;s jay and dede .
anyway , i got to go get my costume .
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
i kiss my mom hotter than that .
he does . i seen it .
our new neighbors ,
medical @-@ marijuana retailer ronnie and his wife , amber ,
moved in two months ago , and --
it &apos;s been a week and a half .
dear god . really ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t get it .
what &apos;s scary about a giant cupcake ?
we &apos;re not doing scary this year .
well , heads up --
we &apos;re doing crap @-@ your @-@ pants scary on account of the contest ,
so i just hope we don &apos;t offend you over here in candy land .
what contest ?
oh , it &apos;s something we started in the old neighborhood .
if you &apos;re into it , you , uh , chip in 20 bucks ,
and scariest house on the street wins the pot .
not actual pot .
i &apos;d have to see a prescription for that .
wait . you &apos;re not a cop --
no , for the 12th time , i &apos;m not a cop .
well , you are not gonna offend me
with your little decorations .
please know that this ... is phil .
when i &apos;m in charge , it &apos;s terrifying .
i &apos;ll bet you give all the other soccer moms
a good scare with that pin that says &quot; boo . &quot;
you are so lucky that i have to go to work today ,
or i would show you scary .
i would win your little contest .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up against .
we don &apos;t let preggos or people with heart trouble
past our front gate .
couple years ago ,
we scared a man into the hospital almost to death .
well , since you got an excuse , princess ,
looks like my winning streak will carry on .
might even win at the old house , too .
we left that place pretty scary .
i &apos;m meeting a friend for coffee .
no , you &apos;re not . no .
you &apos;re helping me take this all down .
everything goes .
everything except the bunny .
i have plans for the bunny .
okay ! on three , say &quot; argh ! &quot;
argh one , two , three !
argh argh !
oh , that &apos;s great .
thank you . and how are you two related ?
uh , you know what -- gay or straight ,
there &apos;s no wrong way to make a family , so ...
okay , down , girl .
i meant , how are your costumes related ?
it &apos;s a parent / child costume contest .
it is ?
it was all clearly stated on the flier .
there was a flier ?
i gave it to you , daddy !
i knew your costume was all wrong !
o @-@ okay , hey , don &apos;t panic .
there &apos;s plenty of time before the parade .
is there another character in &quot; where &apos;s waldo ? &quot;
wizard whitebeard .
okay ! well , that &apos;ll be fun !
i haven &apos;t gone out with a whitebeard
since i took my cousin sally to the prom .
all right , i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
lily , explain daddy &apos;s joke .
i loved having hair , and i knew how to use it .
i &apos;d walk up to a pretty girl
and run my hand through my hair .
score a touchdown , whip the helmet off ,
run my hand through my hair .
people say clothes make the man ,
but that makes no sense .
what makes the man is a nice head of hair .
damn it ! it &apos;s like a phantom limb !
no . no !
this doesn &apos;t look real at all .
alex , where &apos;s that blood
you were using this morning on your finger ?
running through my veins , keeping me alive .
here comes dad .
he &apos;s gonna be all like ,
&quot; no ! what did you do ? !
where &apos;s awesomeland ? ! &quot;
no ! what did you do ? ! where &apos;s awesomeland ? !
are you from the future ?
phil , honey , honey ,
w @-@ we &apos;ve had a little change of plans .
why ?
what are you even doing here ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at work ?
that obnoxious ronnie was worried
that i wouldn &apos;t be able to handle his decorations ,
&apos;cause he &apos;s trying to win
this &quot; scariest house on the street &quot; contest ,
and i was like , &quot; not only can i handle your decorations .
i &apos;m gonna win that contest . &quot;
so welcome to the insane asylum from hell .
that &apos;s what it feels like .
come on . it &apos;s gonna be fun .
the kids are gonna be deranged mental patients ,
and -- and i am going to be a sadistic nurse ,
and you are a demented doctor .
20 years of &quot; no , &quot;
but for this , you &apos;ll dress like a nurse ? !
um , no .
of course the woman is the nurse and the man is the doctor .
that kind of thinking -- that &apos;s what &apos;s scary .
tap out . it &apos;s a holiday .
you know , i put a lot of time and energy into my thing ,
but you just shut it all down to prove something
to people that we barely know and don &apos;t even like !
phil , ronnie made fun of awesomeland .
he called it &quot; candy land . &quot;
so ?
stupidville ? dumbburgh ?
who cares what he thinks ? !
maybe someday you &apos;ll care what i think .
phil ...
well -- honey , look !
i kept your bunny !
nibbles !
made it in the nick of time .
all right , let &apos;s get this parade started
while i &apos;m still just 4,000 years old .
you do know the parade &apos;s not till after school , right ?
what ? no !
i can &apos;t stay that long . i have football practice .
oh , my god . i have to tell lily .
she &apos;s gonna be devastated .
oh , no .
where &apos;s waldo ?
since when has the parade been after school ?
since always . it was on the flier .
how big was this flier ?
oh , so this is how we call each other now ?
mitchell , i have a costume emergency .
just wear it with confidence ,
cam . i &apos;m sure you look great .
no , i can &apos;t find lily !
oh , okay , found her -- by the trash can ,
next to the big kid dressed like a hobo .
oh , you did it .
i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a kid .
i should probably tell a grown @-@ up .
well , you have no idea what &apos;s happening here .
the stenographer is dressed like a spider .
i cannot get anyone to listen to anything i &apos;m --
mitchell , i can &apos;t .
lily ?
honey , listen .
daddy can &apos;t stay for the parade .
but you promised !
no , i know i did , but it starts later than i thought ,
and i have to get to ...
football practice ! it &apos;s fine ! just go !
no , lily ! wait !
well , she &apos;s gone forever .
gloria , what happened to my hair ?
ay , no . please . i cannot have this conversation again .
yes , jay , time is cruel .
my prince charming wig -- it &apos;s gone .
okay , what do you think --
handsome hawaiian or sexy scotsman ?
i can &apos;t do this right now .
come on , jay --
this is my farewell tour
of trick @-@ or @-@ treating in the neighborhood .
i have to go out strong .
or should i just do what people are expecting ?
stay home &apos; cause you &apos;re 20 ?
jay , please don &apos;t be mean to manny .
maybe stella took your wig
and buried it in the yard .
i saw her playing with it earlier .
what ? why didn &apos;t you take it from her ?
i don &apos;t understand your relationship with her .
you let her lick your feet .
who is that possibly hurting ?
what am i gonna do now ?
prince charming had hair !
please . we don &apos;t really know that for sure .
there weren &apos;t cameras back then .
maybe he had to be charming because he was bald .
you really think it &apos;s appropriate
to be strapping your teenage daughter to a gurney ?
if we win , it is .
i may have to take a pee break soon .
ooh . here . use this bedpan .
i &apos;m kidding . that &apos;s gross .
i put candy in it . here .
luke .
luke !
i think i fell asleep .
this thing is like a temple grandin hug .
haley , sweetie , uh , gown &apos;s on backwards .
oh , no . it &apos;s cuter this way .
sexy people go crazy , too , you know .
read a people magazine .
phil .
you &apos;re not even gonna try on your doctor costume ?
nope .
but we &apos;re gonna win .
doesn &apos;t that make you happy ?
do i look happy ?
you got a problem , lady .
this obsessive need to be dark and scary --
you can &apos;t even stop yourself .
i can stop whenever i want .
well , i &apos;m not getting sucked in .
i &apos;m having the halloween that i wanted .
what is all this ?
is this supposed to be funny ?
no , it &apos;s supposed to be scary .
no , it &apos;s supposed to be awesome .
you know , i could tell that you guys
didn &apos;t love us moving in next door .
maybe &apos; cause ronnie deals pot
or maybe &apos; cause of my confederate @-@ flag bikini .
i don &apos;t know , but --
but i thought we were becomin &apos; friends .
i was gonna propose a joint thanksgiving , but ...
this is really low .
no , honey , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay , ronnie !
it &apos;s rude and it &apos;s cruel !
i wish we had our old house
so we could drive it away
as far as possible !
oh , my goodness . what was that ?
amber gets touchy about this stuff .
uh , she --
she spent six months in a cuckoo farm in nevada .
i &apos;m sorry . she gets mad when i say that .
it was in utah .
oh , my god .
we -- we had no idea . i swear .
i @-@ it &apos;s cool .
i &apos;ll just ... give her a box of cap &apos;n crunch
and set her in front of the fish tank .
that seems to calm her down .
okay .
okay .
we have to shut it down . we got to shut it down .
now , when she said &quot; joint thanksgiving , &quot;
do you think that she meant --
no .
okay .
each of these companies
funneled unreported funds into the same account .
now , i believe this chart makes clear
the intricate web of deceit .
okay , i heard it .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna rephrase that .
these companies conspired
to defraud numerous innocent people ,
not to mention the internal revenue service .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
your honor , may we approach ?
if you must .
you see what &apos;s happening here , right ?
you &apos;re losing your fifth case in a row ?
fourth . and --
who said -- am i losing ?
um , i just feel that the -- the jury
might be a little bit distracted by , um ... you know .
please let the record show that counsel is nodding his head
towards the court stenographer , holly .
your honor , opposing counsel &apos;s
grasping at straws
because he &apos;s losing again .
oh , come on ! come on !
she &apos;s dressed like a giant spider !
i need the jury to focus on the details of this case ,
not some ridiculous costume .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re probably a very nice person .
very well .
holly , would you please remove the costume ?
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , i apologize for the delay .
at the request of counsel ,
the court stenographer will now remove the costume .
that redhead &apos;s no fun .
they hate you .
a @-@ as i was saying , um ,
these companies stole from countless innocent people ,
and , you know ,
if someone had dipped into my nest egg like that , uh ...
i &apos;d be awful grouchy .
number four .
here you go .
what are you supposed to be ?
born into another family .
she is tess mcgill ,
feminist heroine from te 1980s classic
&quot; working girl . &quot;
you should check it out sometime .
in a few years .
there is some light vacuuming in underpants .
keep up the good work !
how &apos;s it going here ?
i look stupid !
these puppies are making it impossible
for me to stay mad at you .
stupid , adorable puppies .
welcome to awesomeland ,
where the only thing to fear is fun itself .
claire , i know this isn &apos;t the halloween you wanted ,
but can you try to sell it ?
i &apos;m sorry , honey .
i got mad at you and i upset amber ,
and all because ronnie called me a soccer mom .
what is wrong with me ?
nothing .
i hate it when people assume things about me
that aren &apos;t true --
like because i &apos;m pretty , i &apos;m stuck @-@ up .
when people do that to me , i &apos;m just like ,
&quot; shut up , troll . why am i even talking to you ? &quot;
i do not like being pigeonholed .
it &apos;s obvious , mom --
you use halloween as a way to show people you have edge .
it &apos;s like accountants who buy a harley .
she &apos;s right .
being scary is my motorcycle .
that &apos;s my tess .
i knew my farewell tour would be emotional ,
but at least i can say i did it my way .
you &apos;ve said that four times .
you know he had other songs ?
nice costume . ben franklin , right ?
what ? no ! prince charming .
oh . sorry .
i guess i just picture prince charming with hair .
we all do , but i lost my wig ,
and i don &apos;t have any , so ...
well , you know , there are
some pretty effective solutions for that .
talking about hair plugs ?
yeah .
take some from the side and the back , right ?
you think that would work for me ?
it could .
but you might want a second opinion from an actual doctor .
excuse me .
did you just ask that fake doctor about hair plugs ?
no ! you know how you struggle with the language .
jay .
damn it , gloria .
i miss having a head full of hair .
and don &apos;t act like you don &apos;t miss it , too .
when we got married ,
you had four more hairs than you do now .
this is not a surprise to me .
what about today ? hmm ? earlier ?
when we were not napping ?
when you were a little extra @-@ enthusiastic ?
because you were enthusiastic .
you went out and bought costumes for all of us ,
you were singing .
for once , you were not like , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do this .
&quot; i just want to sit at home , watch golf ,
and eat my 10 @-@ layer dip . &quot;
just five . five layers .
one layer is enough , jay .
i loved that you were having fun with us .
a happy husband --
that &apos;s what is sexy to me .
so you don &apos;t think i look like ben franklin ?
oh , yes ! that &apos;s who it is !
the man from the $ 100 bill -- my favorite !
all right , happy halloween .
that &apos;s your costume ? a big nose ?
all right , you know , cool it .
i &apos;ve had a rough day .
you think you &apos;re the first spongebob i &apos;ve seen ?
i &apos;m missing halloween .
all right , honey , if daddy &apos;s not home in five minutes ,
i will take you trick @-@ or @-@ treating , okay ?
okay ! i made it !
football practice ran late , sweetie .
just give me two minutes . i &apos;m so sorry .
whatever .
i bet all the full @-@ size candy bars are gone .
lily .
nope , nope .
she has every right , mitchell .
you know , i &apos;ve let football consume my life ,
and i fumbled what &apos;s most valuable to me ,
and now i &apos;m stuck !
can somebody please help me ?
don &apos;t help him !
oh , enough , you two !
it &apos;s like &quot; august : osage county &quot; up in here .
all right , you -- - where &apos;s my head ?
it &apos;s right here . stop . just calm down . okay .
you need to let yourself off the hook , all right ?
you didn &apos;t abandon her playing craps .
you had to go to work .
he &apos;s always working .
no , he &apos;s --
he is not always working , lily .
exhibit &quot; a &quot; -- your shirt ,
which he stayed up all night sewing
so that you would have the perfect costume .
exhibit &quot; b &quot; --
those glasses--two hours on ebay .
exhibit &quot; c &quot; -- your satchel .
daddy &apos;s man purse from college
that he had to dig through 10 boxes to find ,
because daddy hid it from him .
but he didn &apos;t read the flier !
i never read it
because i never saw it !
you didn &apos;t see the flier ?
no !
maybe that &apos;s because you never got it .
i submit to you ... the flier ...
which never made it onto the refrigerator ,
where you are supposed to put things ,
because it wa @-@ a @-@ a @-@ s ....
it ... was ...
yes .
lily , your daddy may have missed the parade ,
but he was all over halloween .
i rest my case .
i &apos;m sorry , daddy .
i &apos;m sorry , too .
i got my win .
trials would be a whole lot easier
if juries were made up of
7 @-@ year @-@ old girls , like lily .
and cam .
i know it &apos;s not the point ,
but we totally would &apos;ve won .
might want to leave that out of your apology .
howdy !
hey , ronnie . what &apos;s up ?
ronnie , hi . um , i was looking for amber .
oh , she &apos;s inside .
no , i ain &apos;t !
knock it off , amber !
amber , hi .
um , listen , i wanted to apologize .
i had no idea about your history ,
and i was being insensitive ,
so i was hoping we could start over .
that &apos;s really sweet .
almost makes me feel bad for making the whole thing up .
what ? !
trick !
she never been to a nuthouse .
no !
yeah , i ain &apos;t crazy .
i mean , i &apos;ve been to rehab a few times ,
but that was just for paid vacation .
you lied just to make me feel bad ?
no , no -- we lied
so that we could win with our zombie house o &apos; whores !
that is so messed up .
did you say &quot; whores , &quot; or --
no , no . it ain &apos;t messed up .
the saying is &quot; trick or treat . &quot;
this is the trick part .
our yard &apos;s full o &apos; dead whores .
you got a santa .
yep -- &quot; whores . &quot; i heard it again .
why are we not talking about this ?
there will come a day when you will pay for this .
you won &apos;t know when ,
and you won &apos;t know how ,
but you will feel it .
that chick is scary .
thank you .
you have no idea .
you know , they just make it impossible to find him .
it &apos;s cruel and inappropriate .
it just sets children up to fail ,
and it destroys their self @-@ esteem .
right there .
is he there ?
is -- where --
where did she point ? where did she p--
now i look like rod stewart .
thanks a lot .
i have a head for business and a bod for sin .
yes , you do .
