This is no longer a missing persons investigation.
It's a murder.
I'm Mr. Fitz, your new English teacher.
I would never want to do anything that would get you in trouble.
Wren, I need you to tell them what really happened.
I don't think it would matter what I say.
I saw the way you were looking at my dad yesterday.
I have eyes.
Find someone who's available.
My dad isn't.
Who is that?
Toby.
Toby Cavanaugh.
Whisper, whisper, whisper.
Almost feels like Alison's still here.
Ben, I can't do this right now.
Get off--!
Stop it!
I think there's something wrong with me.
Where are the pictures?
First paper's due Monday,
and I've written two words--my name.
Look.
Is that yours?
It's Alison's!
What do you think?
I don't want to do this right now.
Hanna.
Why are you taking Sean's car?
Hanna?
I never wanted to see another police car in front of this house.
I thought we were done with that.
Mom, I didn't total his car.
They can fix it.
There is nothing I can do about this.
Do you understand me?
How bad did your mom bust you over wrecking Sean's car?
Okay, I did not wreck it; I damaged it.
And, actually, everyone's being really mature about it.
Oh.
There's no "Oh."
We're just being grown-ups, that's all.
Okay, so the town is gonna put in a new bench,
and we'll plant the flowerbeds,
and there's gonna be a pathway of art tiles.
Art tiles?
Messages, pictures,
memories of Alison.
Oh, like little headstones.
Hanna!
What?
We should each do a tile.
You know, I've had Alison's bracelet
since the day we found it in the woods,
and I don't want the responsibility anymore.
I don't want it.
Seriously, somebody take this.
Look at us. Bunch of babies.
There's nothing that "A" can say or do to get us into trouble
without making trouble for herself.
Are you sure it's a "Her"?
Him, her--doesn't make any difference.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna block all messages from people that I don't know--
IMs, texts, e-mails, everything.
Screw "A."
There.
Who's next?
I spy with my little eye something that begins with "F."
Hey, Mr. Fitz.
Looking good, Mr. Fitz.
My turn.
There are teachers that you don't want to see on a bike,
And there are teachers that you do want to see on a bike.
I would not want to see Mr. Gilardi on a bike.
I don't want to think of Mr. Gilardi in motion of any kind.
Ah. Mr. Fitz.
Hanna. Your turn.
You talk to Ben?
Nothing to talk about.
So you're really done?
It's okay. I'm fine.
Okay, if you say so.
I wish we had a drum roll for this.
All right, here it goes.
we are officially "A"-proofed.
Listen.
All those little messages
zipping through the air all around us.
Yep, and none of them from "A."
This feels like a good thing.
Of course it's a good thing.
Out of mind, out of sight.
I got something for you.
I saw this and thought it was
the greatest color on the planet.
I was right.
It's spectacular.
It's--it's great.
Thanks.
Catch you later.
Spence, why didn't your folks
take you to New York with your sister?
I mean, you deserve some retail therapy too.
Not as much as Melissa.
Ooh, hot scarf, Em.
Thanks.
Is it new?
No.
Go ahead, answer it.
We know who it can't be from.
Hanna.
It's my dad!
Hey, dad.
Has she... even, like, talked to her dad
since he walked out on them?
I don't know.
Hanna and her father,
it's one of those "Don't ask, don't tell" situations.
We shouldn't stare at her. Come on.
My brother's post just showed up on my loop.
You added him as a favorite?
Yeah. Moment of weakness.
Sorry.
My fault.
I wonder if we just bumped into "A."
It doesn't matter.
We're done with "A," Right?
Right. Yeah.
But I'm still staying out of Toby's way.
Yeah, and Jenna's.
I guess that's the safest thing to do.
There was no way I was coming back to Pennsylvania
and not seeing you,
But if you've got something you have to do...
No, dad, I haven't got anything.
Then I'll come by, pick you up at seven.
How's that sound?
Sounds great. I'll tell mom.
Um... Dad?
Yes?
Did mom...?
Did your mom what, honey?
You know, never mind. I'll see you tonight.
Bye.
Bye.
Hi.
Hi.
I...
I saw you riding around town the other day...
on your bike.
Yeah. I saw you too. I waved,
remember?
I would have stopped, but you weren't alone.
My friends thought you had nice legs.
What do you think?
That I was embarrassed
that my friends thought you had nice legs.
It's a little awkward under the circumstances.
Aria, what are the circumstances here?
If you know, please tell me
'cause this is completely new territory to me.
Yeah, me too.
Maybe this isn't smart.
I promise you, it's not smart.
But we need to talk.
There are things what we need to cover
that we can't between classes.
Uh, I'm home tonight.
I could make you one of two dishes
that I actually know how to cook,
But I want to talk to you
when I'm not looking at you over a desk,
or through Dan Farren's faux-hawk.
What time?
Seven.
Seven's good.
He has to be in New England for a couple of weeks,
but he's making a special trip out to see me.
That's--that's great, Hanna.
What?
It's just... do you think he's out here
because of the thing with Sean's car?
No, he's not. Look, I asked. Absolutely not.
And besides, even if he was,
at least he's still coming out to see me.
Spencer!
Mr. Sheldrake.
I was gonna tell you in class,
but here you are.
Remarkable job on the russian history essay.
Oh, thanks.
Very lucid presentation.
It's not really a new idea.
I've submitted it for the Golden Orchid.
You what?!
There's an honorarium.
But you know the real upside
to winning an essay competition like that
is how it looks on your applications.
Wait, can we--?
We'll discuss the details after class.
What's a Golden Orchid?
It's a national competition for historical writing.
More academic bling for Spencer.
Okay, see you later.
Are you gonna be in this lab?
Starting today.
Cool.
You were wearing a scarf this morning.
Yeah, I was.
I took it off.
It looked good on you.
Thanks.
Oh, please, no. Not here.
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please.
So, I guess we're lab partners.
You okay with that?
Sure.
Chicken-oh-my-gosh in the middle of the week?
Yeah, I felt like making a little treat for your dad,
something special.
Are you okay with veggie burgers?
Actually, I said I'd have dinner at Spencer's.
Oh. Okay.
And Mike is gonna be out too,
So I guess your dad and I will have the place to ourselves.
That's great.
Isn't that your dad's car?
You so totally have to tell her.
Tell her what?
Aria, you just saw your dad
making out with someone who is not your mom.
Y-you have to tell her.
How am I supposed to tell her that?
I don't know, okay, but you have to.
It's my dad.
Don't answer.
Well, I have to!
He'll try and talk you out of telling.
You can't do that to your mom.
You have to tell her, Aria,
before somebody else does.
Then you'll lose both of them.
God.
Mom.
Yeah?
Can I have a carrot?
Sure.
I wish I had a sister smart enough to steal papers from.
Using Melissa's paper was supposed to be a stopgap.
If I ask Sheldrake to withdraw the essay,
he'll know something's wrong.
Spencer, what makes you
so sure you're going to win the competition?
Oh, right. I forgot.
It's in your DNA.
Here.
Try this one.
This has to be the perfect outfit.
My dad hasn't seen me since I lost the weight.
That jacket's really not you.
Then it's perfect.
Spencer.
What?
Have you peeked?
We blocked whoever it was, and that's it.
United front, remember?
No, no, yeah, I know.
I just wondered if you'd peeked.
No.
Yeah. Me neither.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Look.
Great, you found them. Where were they?
In my chemistry book.
Did you put them in there?
Just tell me if you did,
I won't be angry.
What's there to be angry about?
I think we look cute.
Did you put them in my book?
No, I didn't.
Emily...
It's no big deal.
Somebody must have grabbed them at the party.
That somebody saw these.
This is us--
you and me-- kissing.
Understand?
Maya.
I have to get back to work.
Hanna.
Dad.
Oh, my god, there's barely enough left of you to hug.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
I'll get my bag.
Hello, Tom.
Ashley. How are you?
Good.
Good.
So, you ready to go?
Yep.
Uh, Ash...
Think maybe we got our wires crossed about tonight.
My idea was that this would be a good time
for me to catch up with Hanna.
I guess I must have misunderstood.
My mistake.
Does that work for you, honey?
Just you and I tonight?
Yeah.
Okay.
Not too late, Tom.
Sure.
Bye, mom.
Bye.
Have a good time.
That's a new car,
So I hope you don't mind if I drive, do you?
Hanna?
This is about Sean's car.
Mom did call you.
It's a little more complicated than that.
Well, let me uncomplicate it for you.
If you came here to yell at me,
Let's just go back inside and get it over with.
Or, you know what? Why don't you yell at me right here
so all the neighbors can watch me take my medicine?
I didn't come back to yell at anybody.
I came back to help you through a rough spot.
You're a good girl, Hanna.
You've always been a good girl.
You can get a little... overenthusiastic.
I remember you as a great tree-climber.
The problem was,
you'd sometimes need some help to get back down.
We'll get through this.
I promise.
Now, if you want to go to dinner, we can go to dinner.
If you want to go to the shooting gallery of the Jolly Roger,
We can do that.
Whatever you want. Okay?
Yeah. Okay.
Miss.
Do you use this?
As a paperweight.
Mostly it's to remind myself
that there was literature before laptops.
What do you think?
It's nice.
Yeah, I like it. Thanks for asking me.
You're welcome.
How are things at home?
Fine.
Um... My mom and dad are having a date night.
Mm. Well, maybe they're working things out.
They can have all the alone time in the world,
But she's...
She's gonna be miserable when she finds out.
Aria,
has it ever occurred to you
that maybe your mom knows more about this than you think?
No. She doesn't know. That's the worst part.
Well, almost the worst part.
Well, it's possible that your parents have come
to some sort of understanding that you don't know about.
No, it's not possible.
What do you mean, an "understanding"?
Okay, um...
When I was 12, my parents broke up,
and it threw my brother and me for a loop.
I found out later they'd both been cheating.
They worked through their infidelity,
it was just something else that killed the marriage.
But that's your family, not mine.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm just saying
that even though your dad put you in this position,
it's not your problem to fix.
I'm not trying to fix it. I'm trying to deal with it.
But they are the ones that should be dealing with this.
What you can't see now is that
your parents need to figure it out for themselves, like adults.
Like adults?
Right.
Like I'm not mature enough to deal with this?
I-I didn't say that.
Yeah, I think that's exactly what you said.
You said I am a child
and I should mind my own business.
I guarantee you that's not what I said.
Well, if I'm such a child,
why did you ask me here?
I asked you here because
I don't see you as a child,
And that's exactly why we need to figure out
what's going on between us.
Okay. Just leave my parents out of it.
You came to me about your father. Do you remember that?
You know, I, um...
I think I made a mistake coming here.
I don't think you did.
I do.
It's not something an adult would have done.
It was great.
Incredible, really.
Where'd your dad take you?
Jolly Roger's.
What, the lame amusement park?
Okay, it is not lame.
We didn't go on the tilt-a-whirl.
We walked around and talked.
And I told him about what's going on.
Some of what was going on, and he listened.
He wants to take me to a real dinner tonight.
He said he has something to tell me.
I don't know,
I think he wants to spend more time with me.
I mean, maybe summers in Maryland.
Seriously?
Would you go?
Well, I wouldn't move away,
not forever.
I don't want to leave my mom alone, but...
I would like to see my dad more.
Good for you.
I'm wondering, is anybody else
bothered by Atticus' hypocrisy at the end of the novel.
Well, he is Mr. Due Process
when it comes to Tom Robinson,
then as soon as Bob Ewell gets stabbed,
he's willing to buy into the sheriff's cover-up.
He was protecting Boo Radley.
Protecting him?
From what, the justice system?
Atticus is an officer of the court,
and he's conspiring to cover up a crime.
And he's willing to let his own son take the fall
for something that Boo Radley did?
It was a trade.
What was a trade?
Mr. Ewell would have killed those kids.
Boo saved them.
And Atticus was still feeling guilty over Tom Robinson,
so... he offered Jem to take Boo's place,
almost like a sacrifice.
Oh. Very noble.
Too bad Jem was unconscious.
You think he might have had a different opinion?
No, Jem would have said yes.
You're sure about that?
He was brought up right.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sperling,
do you have something to add to the discussion,
aside from phlegm?
Just...
Well, his dad was a lawyer.
He could get the kid off.
Being brought up right had nothing to do with it.
Really?
The whole book is about what shapes us into adults,
or haven't you been paying attention?
I'm just saying that she--
You're just saying that
Aria made an attempt to understand this book
and you haven't.
No, I wasn't saying that, Mr. Fitz.
Sorry. What are you trying to say?
Well, it'd probably be easier for Atticus to get the kid off
than to get Boo off, that's all.
Well, I am honored to get you two nights in a row.
You think Sean will be jealous?
I haven't spoken to Sean since the party.
Yeah, I was waiting for you to say something last night
about what happened between you two.
Well, I was having too much fun.
I wonder if all this has a little less to do with Sean
and more to do with something else.
Something else?
How are you about what happened with Alison?
I don't know. I mean, sometimes I just...
want to get away.
You know, be somewhere else for a while.
Somewhere you can clear your head,
maybe get a new perspective on things?
Yeah, that's exactly what I mean.
Hanna, there's a couple of matters that we have to discuss.
Really? What matters?
Hey. Here you are.
Hi.
Hanna, this is Isabel, my fiance.
Fiance?
I am so happy to meet you, Hanna.
Um, and this is Isabel's daughter, Kate.
Kate, this is Hanna.
Hanna.
I, uh, thought it was time we all met.
Hello?
Who is there?
Where the hell are you?
I picked this for you, from the garden.
Wren, what the hell are you doing here?
I've come here to set things right.
You're drunk.
One does not come unfortified to the house of Hastings.
Wren, I thought you were an axe murderer or something.
I tried calling you,
but you were blocking my number.
N--
Oh, no, I wasn't blocking you, I just...
Did you break through the back door?
I had difficulty locating the front of the house. I'm sorry.
Wren.
Go. Now.
I've thought of nothing but you since you came to see me.
I've been a coward.
But that ends tonight.
I'm here to take full responsibility.
Summon your father.
I'm not summoning anybody.
My parents are in New York with Melissa.
Then I shall depart.
Great!
Hello!
Great!
Your face
is very fair.
How about some black coffee?
I've been drinking Scotch.
I'd rather not mix my beverages.
Okay, come on, right here.
Yes.
You scared the hell out of me.
Okay, I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
First you complain about me being immature,
And then you act like that in class,
like I needed to be protected.
And everybody knew that
there was something weird going on.
I mean, God! What was that?
What, were you trying to teach me some kind of lesson or something?
Because I totally don't need that from you.
And you don't know anything about my parents,
so don't say that they have some kind of arrangement
or understanding or something,
Because you don't know them,
and you don't know me, okay?
Yeah, you're right.
I am?
I really...
don't know anything about you.
I'm sorry about the mess.
I'll clean that up later.
I'm not talking about the geranium.
Why do you think
you had to get drunk to talk to my father?
For many complex psychological reasons,
but mainly because he scares the vinegar out of me.
He's really not that bad,
Once you get to know him.
Things'll go back to normal... eventually.
Yeah. What passes for normal around here.
I thought you wanted things the way they were.
I guess I do.
I don't know. I've never known anything else.
I know I never wanted to hurt Melissa.
Yeah.
And sometimes it looks like North and South Korea
between us, but...
she's my sister.
That still counts.
Well, I think I've imposed enough.
Um, you can't drive like that.
Oh, I'm not going all the way back to Philadelphia.
I've got a room in the Edgewood Motor Court.
You can't drive anywhere.
Give me your keys.
Come on. Together. Here.
...So I turn around, and there's Jeff behind me,
and he is so focused on beating me
that he forgets to lift the daggerboard,
as we're approaching the beach.
So he gets all hung up in the shallows,
and I simply walk onto the beach and...
take a bow.
Hanna, do you sail?
No.
Oh, you should.
Kate could teach you. She's a very good teacher.
Especially with beginners.
I think it would be so much fun for both of you.
Going out together on a boat.
Seeing who's coming back.
Was that a joke?
Of course it was a joke.
And this is a fork.
Just so you know, Hanna,
I had a chat with Sean's father,
and everything's gonna work out.
You talked to Sean's dad?
Mm-hm.
He, uh, gave me an estimate on the damage you did to his car,
and we agreed to settle things
without getting the insurance companies involved,
so I'll write a check,
and you will work off the cost of repairs
in Sean's mother's office.
Sean's mother is a dentist.
Well, you won't be drilling teeth.
You'll be cleaning up, doing light clerical work,
you know, answering phones, after school and on weekends.
That could be interesting.
I am fascinated by dentistry, aren't you?
Plaque, cavities, fake-looking veneers.
Sorry.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I mean, as okay as I can be taking out the garbage.
I know that you're not crazy about having me for a lab partner.
No.
It's okay. I'm cool with that.
Really? You wouldn't switch if you could?
I understand.
You have to be careful with who you get close to.
I know people think I'm some kind of freak.
I can't do anything about that.
But it's got to bother you,
idiots running around,
putting shaving cream in your locker,
laughing at you, making stuff up about who you are.
I didn't say that it doesn't get to me,
It's just that there's nothing I can do about it.
Like you said, they're idiots.
Sorry.
You notice how much you and I
keep saying we're sorry to each other?
Sorry.
Do you see what I mean?
That other day in chemistry...
There was something in my book.
Some pictures.
Did you see them?
Before I closed my book,
did you see what they were?
I don't think you wanted anybody to see them.
I'm cool with that.
You are?
Do you still swim?
Yes, I do.
Do you do it because people are watching you,
or because you like to swim?
I...
do it because I love the way it makes me feel.
Then forget about the idiots.
They're going to see what they want to see.
Even if you completely changed everything,
they wouldn't be happy.
They don't want you to change.
They want you to go away.
I tried that. I didn't like it.
And...
Now you're back.
Yeah. I am.
See you tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
You're lucky.
My cooking's always better the next day.
I make really good leftovers. Don't laugh.
No, seriously.
The pesto will get up your nose.
We'll need the Jaws Of Life in here.
I'm sorry about what happened in class.
I was mad at you for walking out of here.
It's stupid, but I was.
Going after Sperling like that,
not my finest hour as a teacher.
Well, you're right about me.
I am a fixer when it comes to my family.
I'm the one planning and negotiating and...
just trying to keep us together and keep things solid.
What are you afraid of?
That things will change.
But...
that's not really helping, is it? It's just...
It's just trying to keep things frozen.
It's human nature to try and hold on to things.
I feel like my aunt Ruth.
She had her pet cat stuffed when he died,
And you'd walk in her house, and...
There's mugsy on the piano.
He's there, and she talks to him.
There's really not much difference
between mugsy alive and mugsy stuffed.
I mean, he's a cat.
Aunt ruth, she's really happy,
But... The rest of us are just kind of creeped out.
I can't fix this.
And, if it's gonna be fixed
If then they're just gonna have to do it themselves.
All I can do is tell the truth.
Otherwise, I could lose the both of them.
I have to go.
Do you need help cleaning up?
You could... Stay.
No, I have to go talk to my mom.
You're sure about that?
Yeah, I'm sure.
How are you gonna get home?
Don't worry about me.
I was telling the truth.
About wishing I'd met you first.
Come inside.
I've done some pretty stupid things lately.
I'm way over my limit.
Good night, Spencer.
Bye, Wren.
And from the request line,
This next one goes out to Hanna,
From her best friend, "A."
Here you go, Hanna.
I Don't Need You Anymore
Okay, whatever you're thinking,
It's not what you think.
Hanna.
We are so out of our league.
Hi.
Don't know what I'm supposed to do right now,
Hug you or shake hands?
I mean, there might be all sorts of security cameras around.
Sorry.
Don't say that.
You have...
Every right to be mad at me.
I'm not mad at you.
I was wrong to jump on you about the pictures.
Is this about the pictures, or...
Is it about the kiss?
I liked the kiss,
But I don't know what that kiss means.
You spend too much time thinking about what things mean--
A kiss, a picture,
A scarf.
There's so much going on in my head right now.
I'm just trying to figure out the right thing to do.
What do you need,
Right now?
A little time. Some space.
Not just with you, but with my mom, with everybody.
We can get some space here.
It's okay.
Thanks.
Good night.
I care about you.
So I'll wait.
You don't...
Need to say anything.
You just need to know that.
Mom?
I have to tell you something.
It's important.
There's, um...
There's something you should know.
Mo
问问你女儿吧 她什么都知道 -A
What are we gonna do about "A"?
I mean, he or she or it hasn't stopped.
They're calling radio stations, making dedications.
What do we do now?
I don't know, hanna.
Well, it was your idea to shut her out.
And everybody went along with it.
United we stand. Great.
Spencer.
Somebody's been in the house.
Alison's bracelet!
小贱人们 -A
Is that jungle red?
Alison's color.
小贱人们 -A
