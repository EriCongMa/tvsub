&quot; run baby run &quot;
now mr. linzer hates the food ,
so he will tell you he feels fine .
he does not feel fine .
and if you release him before his i.n.r. stabilizes ,
he will bleed to death .
murphy &apos;s gonna keep an eye on him .
i am gonna keep an eye on him .
mrs. gellman &apos;s still intubated ,
but i want the tube out by monday .
have the nurses page you as soon as she starts breathing on her--
i @-@ i will ask them myself .
oh , it &apos;s not too much for you ?
not at all .
and yet , you &apos;re trying to fob it off to petunia here ,
with her years and years of experience in critical care .
i want you to relax on your honeymoon .
i thought that you &apos;d be reassured
by having two sets of eyes on your patients .
the notion of an intern handling my patients
is the best way i can think of
to ruin a perfectly good mai tai .
oh , are you going someplace warm ?
we don &apos;t have to talk about it .
oh , no . i want to talk to you about my honeymoon--
the hotel , the sights ...
i &apos;m gonna handle mrs. gellman myself .
what i &apos;m wearing on the plane , what i &apos;m wearing on the beach .
leah , leave .
and the wedding--should i get my nails done today
or tomorrow on my way to the ceremony ?
okay , she &apos;s gone . i got this .
the adrenal system reacts to stress
by releasing hormones that makes us alert and reactive .
the problem is ,
the adrenal system can &apos;t tell what &apos;s a regular case of nerves
and what &apos;s a real impending disaster .
yo , lefkowitz .
did you bring it ?
that &apos;s the whole thing ? yep .
lefkowitz has gastroparesis
so he can &apos;t digest his food .
he was an epic puker for a long time ,
and now he can &apos;t really eat at all .
so we &apos;re gonna give you a gastric neurostimulator .
this thing , it &apos;s gonna zap your stomach
so it remembers
to push the food down your system .
get you back on burgers and fries .
that &apos;s amazing .
yeah , well , the guys at the airport x @-@ ray are gonna go nuts .
that &apos;s sick .
oh , uh , this is dr. wilson .
she &apos;s gonna be operating with me .
you &apos;ve got a @-@ a crack team , iron man .
hey .
don &apos;t .
all right , all right . all right .
i &apos;ll stop . i &apos;ll stop .
jeez .
when you and arizona get to the wedding tomorrow ...
mm @-@ hmm .
don &apos;t sit down .
what do you mean , don &apos;t sit down ?
just find a place and stand there .
you want us to stand in the back ?
then we won &apos;t be able to hear anything .
stand in the damn front .
and block everybody &apos;s view ?
i mean , if we &apos;re-- i don &apos;t--
just pick a spot .
you know , it &apos;s not complicated . ugh !
you know , people allow you to open them up with a knife .
if they knew you couldn &apos;t follow a simple instruction ,
they would run like the wind from this place .
are you ...
are you trying to say , &quot; would you do me the honor
of being mbridesmaids ? &quot;
does the whole thing have to be about you ?
just put on a dress and don &apos;t sit down .
aww . we &apos;re bridesmaids .
oh , don &apos;t even---
ju--ju--see ? ugh .
this is what i was trying to avoid .
now once i remove the sural nerve from your leg ,
dr. torres will graft it on to dr. shepherd &apos;s median nerve .
you &apos;ll likely experience some discomfort
in your leg for a few weeks--
months . months .
and when he says &quot; discomfort , &quot; it &apos;s gonna hurt like hell .
well , you &apos;re a bag of sunshine , aren &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t want to hear six months from now
that you can &apos;t move
and that the ibuprofen hurts your stomach .
he makes me sound like i &apos;m a 90 @-@ year @-@ old man .
have you noticed that ?
because i &apos;ve heard for decades how i ruined your life ...
because you did .
and that mom doesn &apos;t love you .
because she doesn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t want to hear about this .
i think what you &apos;re trying to say is &quot; thank you , lizzie ,
for cutting off a leg and giving it to me . &quot;
ah . here it is . this is how it &apos;s gonna go down in history .
it is a nerve . it is not the entire leg .
okay . let &apos;s focus . jackson .
um , i think dr. shepherd &apos;s right .
if you &apos;re unsure , we--
oh , come on .
i &apos;m just winding him up because it is so easy .
just give me the form .
okay .
now can i go hang out with zola in day care ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
they don &apos;t let the adults come and go
because it &apos;s harder on the kids .
i will bring her to you later .
grey .
uh , when you get to the wedding tomorrow ,
don &apos;t sit down .
the lawyer put together the papers .
they &apos;re gonna send them over tomorrow .
oh , i signed a bunch of stuff with them last week .
uh , not the plane crash . the divorce .
oh .
that was fast .
i said we wanted to move quickly .
apparently .
it &apos;s all done . you just have to sign .
is that a problem ?
nope .
tomorrow , with a pen .
okay .
everything off from the waist down .
nice paper tablecloth for you . i &apos;ll be right back .
you know , i was thinking about telling lizzie
if you &apos;re okay with that .
i think it &apos;s still kind of early .
yeah , but she &apos;s doing this thing for me .
she &apos;ll tell your whole entire family .
well , you told cristina .
i haven &apos;t .
still ?
there &apos;s no point .
i &apos;m probably gonna miscarry anyway .
meredith ...
i am just stating the facts .
i have a very unstable uterus .
this baby has an uphill climb .
i am just being realistic .
ready to take a look ?
yeah .
okay , scoot down .
now there &apos;s still a lot we can do
to support the pregnancy , right ,
even with our history ?
of course . you &apos;ve got some risk factors .
but we &apos;re gonna watch you like a hawk .
okay .
there we go .
hi , baby .
good news .
arizona and i both have red dresses .
now they &apos;re not the same , but they are similar .
so it &apos;s not like matchy @-@ matchy , but it &apos;ll be super cute .
now which part of my face says i want super cute ?
get over it already . it &apos;s a wedding .
no one cares that it &apos;s your second other than you .
just hold your nose . it &apos;ll be over in a few hours .
sure . and then we &apos;ll be married .
and , oh , him in l.a. , me here with my son
and a job that &apos;s known to take up a great deal of time .
oh , and he &apos;s an intern ,
because one specialty wasn &apos;t enough for him .
let &apos;s get to that part .
you know , everyone &apos;s acting like i &apos;m some jittery bride .
maybe i have something to jitter about .
well ...
if it &apos;s the marriage you &apos;re really worried about ...
you can run .
excuse me ?
leave him at the altar . it &apos;s a clean break .
he &apos;s so pissed that you stood him up
in front of all his people , the whole thing is just over .
and then you &apos;re not wrestling with a relationship
that &apos;s doomed or tied to someone for the rest of your life .
i mean , sure , you love each other now .
but the next thing you know ,
you are cleaning his pee off the ground
and going to bed with a foot @-@ wide demilitarized zone
down the middle of the bed .
kidding .
i &apos;m just kidding . i &apos;m kidding .
no , it ... it &apos;ll be fine . it &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , ben &apos;s the ...
the best . he &apos;s ...
he ...
we have to do an open procedure &apos; cause he &apos;s got adhesions
from a surgery a couple years ago .
once he &apos;s open ,
you can take down the adhesions .
really ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve never done anything like that before .
yeah , well , if it was me ,
i &apos;d spend the next few hours in the skills lab .
dr. karev .
is this because i told you about when i was a kid ?
oh , yeah . i feel so bad you were a dumpster @-@ diving orphan ,
i &apos;m letting you hack up a 10 year old .
sorry . stupid .
ya think ?
flowers , music ...
it &apos;s a recipe for disaster .
april , you &apos;re going to be fine .
don &apos;t worry about it .
oh , come on . don &apos;t tell her she &apos;s gonna be fine .
you &apos;re gonna be looking all pretty ,
little bit of lip gloss on your prude @-@ y little mouth .
jackson will spot her across the room .
try to look away , but he can &apos;t .
you &apos;re irresistible in your dress .
one drink , and you &apos;re doing the hippity @-@ dippity
in the coat room .
the dress ? oh , god .
see ?
cruel .
what ?
nothing .
so he &apos;s into you now ?
karev ? no .
then why &apos;s he letting you take down adhesions ?
have you ever removed adhesions ?
no . none of us have .
hey , wilson .
uh , where are sujin kim &apos;s post @-@ op notes ?
i didn &apos;t finish it .
i wanted to practice for this gastric neurostimulator surgery
i &apos;m doing with dr. karev .
she &apos;s taking down the adhesions .
really ? oh .
good for you . he must really trust you .
i hope you &apos;re not using blunt dissection ,
&apos;cause that &apos;ll tear it .
you want nice , precise moves with the instruments .
okay .
you sure you &apos;re ready for this ?
yeah . you want me to get you that chart ?
no . it can wait .
you should practice .
see ? she shouldn &apos;t even be doing a move like this .
he &apos;s into her .
the last thing you want at your wedding
is to wonder if mr. linzer is circling the drain
just because nobody was monitoring his i.n.r.
so i &apos;ll just stick around here tomorrow
and keep an eye on him .
kepner , you broke up with avery .
i-- yes .
yes . i @-@ i don &apos;t know what that has to--
you &apos;re afraid that the sight
of me in cream colored raw silk
will bring tears to your eyes .
i am sure that you will be beautiful--
i look at my father , he kisses me on the cheek ,
i turn away from him ,
take a breath .
dr. webber .
i step towards ben ...
and you and jackson lock eyes from across the room .
you melt into him like snow in the rain .
i knew you would understand .
suck it up , kepner .
if i have to go , you have to go .
okay .
&quot; if i have to go , you have to go &quot; ?
oh , drop it .
oh , no .
that &apos;s the most beautiful sentiment i &apos;ve ever heard .
lizzie &apos;s calves are a little shorter
than we anticipated .
tall girl , short calves .
so is that gonna be a problem ?
no , not if we just get
a little more nerve from the other leg .
are you saying to-- no .
derek .
absolutely not .
no , i never liked this idea in the first place .
we find another donor or we don &apos;t do it .
well , we couldn &apos;t find another donor .
that &apos;s why we--
well , then we &apos;re out of luck .
can &apos;t we just--
no , we can &apos;t .
we &apos;re not gonna talk about this .
we &apos;re not gonna float this past lizzie .
we &apos;re not cutting both her legs to remove pieces .
cancel the procedure .
i think you should bring a date to dr. bailey &apos;s wedding .
that way we will focus on our dates
and not on each other .
or we could just be focused on the happy couple .
i am wearing a strapless dress .
from here up , i &apos;m completely naked .
just ... wear a different dress .
i don &apos;t have a different dress .
i work long hours . i don &apos;t shop .
i have--i have one dressy dress .
how am i supposed to find a date with one day &apos;s notice ?
stephanie . hey .
um , would you like to go to dr. bailey &apos;s wedding ?
oh , what ?
dr. avery would love for you to go with him .
that &apos;s not true .
he thinks that you &apos;d be embarrassed ,
but you &apos;re not embarrassed , are you ?
of course she &apos;s embarrassed .
she &apos;ll get over it .
look , don &apos;t get other--
strapless ...
and tight .
i will pick you up at 1 : 00 tomorrow
in the locker room .
what just happened ?
what about you ?
you got to pick mine , so i get to pick yours , right ?
jackson .
what about shane ?
he &apos;s a good @-@ looking piece of man , huh ?
they &apos;re that short ?
no , they &apos;re perfectly respectable calves .
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re not gonna get quite enough nerve
from just the one .
okay .
i know it &apos;s a lot to ask .
no , it &apos;s , uh , fine . do what you need to do .
derek thinks it &apos;s too much to ask ,
but he really needs this ,
so if he comes to you and tries to talk you out of it ,
you have to push .
but don &apos;t tell him that i &apos;m the one that came to you ,
because he won &apos;t like that .
you &apos;ve got some balls , don &apos;t you ?
you know , if it &apos;s too much , we can call the whole thing off .
you know we &apos;re family , right ?
there was no wedding , meredith .
you adopted a baby
and you never invited us to come meet her .
you never accepted our invitation to come see us .
all we got was a couple of pictures via e @-@ mail .
you know , my kids were so excited that for months ,
they walked around telling every african @-@ american person they saw
that we have a brown baby in the family ?
a year later , they kind of think i made the whole thing up .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just , you know ,
with everything that &apos;s been going on--
no , i get that we &apos;re all busy ,
but you &apos;re not shy about asking me for a couple of body parts ,
and now you want me to cover your tracks with derek ?
if you feel like it &apos;s inappropriate , we--
no , it &apos;s what sisters ask sisters to do .
we cover each other &apos;s asses .
look , if you want to be a sister ,
i am delighted , but then act like one .
my version of family isn &apos;t like your version .
you guys give each other crap and then you laugh about it .
you &apos;d walk through fire for each other .
greys are not like that .
derek said you had a sister who worked here .
half .
she was on the plane ?
you know , i @-@ i really don &apos;t want to talk about my sister .
my husband really needs this , so you don &apos;t have to like me ,
just--just him .
you have a child .
she &apos;s part of my family .
you of all people should realize ,
you need spares in a family .
you need as many as you can get .
it was very nice to talk to you , lizzie .
i stashed a little johnnie in case the ceremony &apos;s got
some cousin reading a poem .
right .
uh , i meant to find you .
i &apos;m kind of bringing a date .
yeah , me .
two guys picking up bridesmaids from out of town .
april &apos;s convinced that if we don &apos;t both bring dates ,
then we &apos;re both gonna end up ...
why you gotta talk to her ?
she ruins everything .
how about i find someone for you to go with ?
you know , maybe stephanie has a friend .
stephanie ? that &apos;s who you &apos;re taking ?
you want a date or not ?
no .
all right .
okay . whatever .
just don &apos;t get me an ugly one .
we &apos;re not doing the procedure .
of course we &apos;re doing it .
you know what happened when i said i &apos;d do this ?
mom called me three times in one day .
it just brings tears to my eyes .
she &apos;s a mess .
come on . you &apos;re the golden child .
the rest of us are just scrapping for second position ,
and i just put a lock on it for life .
you think i &apos;m giving that up
just &apos; cause you have to cut into two legs instead of one ?
lizzie--
no , we &apos;re not discussing it . i &apos;ve decided .
get back on the horse , derek .
oh , okay . so you think i &apos;m using this as an excuse ,
that i &apos;m too scared to try and operate again ?
no , of course not . nothing scares you .
what if it doesn &apos;t work ?
what if we go through all of this
and nothing comes of it ?
well , then at least we tried .
we &apos;re doing it . just ... say thank you .
you ready ?
yep .
bovie , please .
thank you .
okay , here ?
yep .
take your time .
okay .
watch out for the blood vessels .
wow . look at you , all grown @-@ up .
up in the skills lab , i was doing--
you put a hole in his stomach .
i haven &apos;t even--
move , now . move . all right . clamp .
here you go .
2.0 vicryl .
i &apos;ll get it .
suction .
hey , steph .
you okay there ?
fine .
terrific .
i wanted to ask you--
i was gonna go to the wedding with ,
you know , a friend-- a guy , like , stag .
yeah ?
and now he feels like i &apos;m bailing on him .
you don &apos;t have to go with me .
no , no . you don &apos;t want to go ?
you have a date with guy .
i ditched him , and i want you to find somebody for him .
is that weird ?
nothing about this is weird .
terrific .
there &apos;s still some spillage .
give me some lap pads ...
and some 2.0 silk .
get over here and grab the retractor
so we can put the device back in .
wilson .
i can &apos;t get my hands to stay still .
well , shake it off and get over here .
the kid &apos;s gonna be fine ,
just grab the damn retractor .
get out .
go !
you think bailey will notice if i &apos;m not there ?
she just made you a bridesmaid .
oh , she doesn &apos;t care about all of that .
she just wants a bunch of people standing up there
so it won &apos;t look weird
when ben has all his guys standing up there .
and i have a packed day tomorrow .
yeah , &apos; cause you &apos;re going to a wedding .
you &apos;re supposed to wear heels ...
to a fancy occasion .
oh , come on .
no , they make you feel tall and confident
and feminine and--
and my plastic foot isn &apos;t the right shape for ... heels .
i didn &apos;t get that kind .
well , i mean--
it &apos;s not nothing .
i mean , why do you think women all over the world wear them ?
because women all over the world are stupid .
oh , okay . so you &apos;re gonna wear flats ?
oh , i &apos;d be happy to wear flats .
oh , no , you wouldn &apos;t because then you would feel dumpy .
oh @-@ ho . did you just call me dumpy ?
can you just for one second admit
that you know what it is i &apos;m talking about ?
okay , i know it &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s hard all the time ,
and this is just one more reminder .
but you are so , so beautiful .
yeah , people stand next to you
and immediately feel bad about themselves .
it &apos;s a public service
that you &apos;re a couple of inches shorter .
it is a kindness to every other woman at that wedding
that you are just one tiny bit less beautiful .
are you still mad at me because i called lizzie ?
do you still love me ?
medium .
i just want your hand to be better
so that we can put this stupid plane crash stuff behind us .
well , the lawyer called to schedule a deposition .
he thinks we have a strong case ,
especially now that cristina and owen are getting divorced .
what does that have to do with anything ?
well , it &apos;d be a big conflict of interest
if owen was married to one of the plaintiffs .
that &apos;s why they got divorced , right ?
she didn &apos;t tell you ?
no . why would she not tell me that ?
you didn &apos;t tell her you were pregnant .
maybe things are different now .
on the morning of your wedding ?
oh , my house is filled with my family
talking about makeup and hair .
just check into a hotel . dr. bailey .
take a nice long bath , get a manicure .
oh , now i got you talking about makeup and hair ?
dr. bailey , what are you doing here ?
checking up on my patients .
making sure you haven &apos;t bungled anything .
don &apos;t mention her hair .
why ? did something happen to your hair ?
he probably knew it was risky ,
so he wanted it on me and not him .
you have to stop . you &apos;re making yourself crazy .
i &apos;m gonna get fired .
no , you &apos;re not .
just keep your head down and do your work .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
now i have to ask you something ,
and in light of the fact
that you think your job is on the line ,
it &apos;s gonna sound really stupid .
whatever . it &apos;s okay .
dr. avery asked me to dr . bailey &apos;s wedding .
and i can &apos;t put two words together
into a sentence when i &apos;m within 2 feet of him ,
and he &apos;s bringing a friend ,
and he asked me to bring a friend ,
and it &apos;ll be like a bunch of us ,
and we &apos;ll all go together .
you &apos;re right . it sounds really stupid .
but will you do it ?
please , jo .
somebody page cardio ?
yeah . g.s.w. to the chest .
we put up 2 and a half liters of blood
when we put in the chest tube .
we should move him upstairs .
there is a bullet in the abdomen .
i can do it , or we can call for somebody else .
you can do it . amicable , right ?
mm @-@ hmm . let &apos;s move .
you &apos;re still rechecking kepner &apos;s work ?
what i was born to do .
i have a chole in about ten minutes .
in and out , the whole thing should take an hour .
you want to scrub in ?
take the edge off before you go home and get dressed ?
you ... are a good man .
dr. webber .
oh , the man of the hour .
oh , tell me you &apos;re not here to take me back to that house .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not .
okay , well , he , um , just asked me to do a chole with him ...
and it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s calmed me down on a day full of people
trying and failing to calm me down .
why do you think he asked you ?
you called him ?
thank you .
both of you .
so can i have a car pick you up at the house ?
how many times do i have to say no to that ?
a person shouldn &apos;t drive themselves
to their own wedding .
well , i like to drive .
in a wedding gown ?
y--it &apos;s my last ten minutes as a single woman .
you know , you both were on a roll there .
why are you trying to screw it up now ?
i &apos;ll see you in the o.r.
and i will see you
at the altar .
dr. robbins .
yeah . hi .
dr. karev had me take down the adhesions .
yeah . yeah , how &apos;d that go ?
some of the adhesions were stuck to the stomach .
the stomach was injured .
he could be septic by now .
i don &apos;t think he had any business
having an intern do that kind of move .
i mean , you were pretty shocked to hear that i was doing it .
he threw me in the deep end , probably because--
okay , hang on .
what exactly are you saying about your attending ?
g.s.w.
sweet .
scrubbing in with owen ,
who wants to sign our divorce papers today .
i guess we &apos;re being mature and moving on .
speaking of which , why didn &apos;t you tell me
that the divorce was because of the plane crash lawsuit ?
what ?
derek told me , so that the case is stronger .
which is great , i &apos;m glad ,
especially if it means
the two of you are getting back together .
it &apos;s good news , and i don &apos;t know
why you wouldn &apos;t want to share that with me ?
because i didn &apos;t know .
you ready ?
what ?
dr. shepherd &apos;s prepped ?
yep .
uh , dr. torres is going over the studies .
okay .
hold it together .
well , a nerve extraction &apos;s a pretty simple procedure .
not that .
he asked me on a date , to dr . bailey &apos;s wedding .
dr. kepner asked me .
it &apos;s a date ?
it &apos;s not , like , a mentoring thing ?
how is drinking champagne
and dancing to barry white a mentoring thing ?
i thought it was , like ,
spending time getting to know the interns
in a casual , stress @-@ free environment .
that was the free @-@ doughnuts thing in the lounge .
this is a wedding .
i can &apos;t go on a date with my boss .
i need to focus on my work ,
not get all wrapped up in the ladies .
did you really just say &quot; the ladies &quot; ?
you &apos;re the one who just said
you couldn &apos;t concentrate in the o.r. ,
cause dr. avery might look at you
with his limpid green eyes .
the eyes are really intense .
you &apos;ve noticed it yourself , right ?
get a grip .
you get a grip .
karev , did you tell wilson that
she &apos;d be fired for screwing up a gastric implant ?
what ?
is the patient gonna make it ?
the patient &apos;s fine .
what the hell did she tell you ?
she thinks that you set her up
to take the fall on a risky o.r. procedure ,
and it kind of sounds like you did .
it would &apos;ve been risky no matter who did it .
and i was standing right there .
the second it got hairy , i took over .
she was in over her head .
and where do you think i got the idea
to do something like that ?
what are you talking about ?
you . i &apos;m trying to be like you were with me .
you let me try crap so i got confidence in myself .
that &apos;s what i was trying to do ,
not treat the stupid morons like the stupid morons that
i think they are .
i gave you opportunities .
i also gave you a boatload of encouragement and support .
i didn &apos;t drop @-@ kick you into the deep end of the pool ...
and yell , &quot; swim , idiot . &quot;
you &apos;re a teacher now .
your students fail , you &apos;ve failed .
glad you &apos;re driving yourself to the wedding .
remind me to stay off the roads .
were you like this ?
on my wedding day ,
i remember staring at my socks for a long time .
i had no idea what to do with &apos; em .
you know , ten years from now ,
if the marriage is strong ,
i &apos;ll look back at today and say ...
&quot; it was just a little bit of cold feet . &quot;
if we &apos;re in a nasty divorce , i &apos;ll say ,
&quot; i knew it was a mistake the day we got married . &quot;
you think it &apos;s a mistake ?
i just feel ...
worried .
i never felt that way with tucker .
you were a child when you married tucker .
you &apos;re an adult now .
you know the world &apos;s an ambiguous place .
you know that love doesn &apos;t conquer all .
it conquers some stuff .
the other stuff kicks the living crap out of love .
and this is the pep talk ?
overwhelming doubt is a problem .
a little bit of doubt is just a sign of an intelligent adult .
is grey gonna be in the gallery ?
no . she didn &apos;t want to make you nervous .
i told her you don &apos;t get nervous .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
close your eyes .
enjoy your nap .
you &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .
torres .
you &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .
we good to go ?
yes , we are .
yes . we &apos;re--yes .
jackson , i just want to let you know ,
i &apos;ll be here watching the whole time .
couldn &apos;t be happier .
no mistakes .
that &apos;s the plan .
are you kidding me ?
get that woman out of my gallery .
that &apos;s not a good idea .
get her out .
i heard that , avery .
edwards , don &apos;t even think about it .
now .
edwards , you wouldn &apos;t dare .
you have years with me .
i can be very difficult to deal with .
15 @-@ blade , please .
you narced on me to my boss ?
i worked hard to get here .
i &apos;m not gonna let myself get fired because--
nobody &apos;s firing you .
i was trying to help you .
i clearly wasn &apos;t ready for it .
why , because i had to take over ?
look , you can &apos;t go crying
to my damn boss every time you get scared .
you can &apos;t cry at all when you get scared
because it &apos;s scary in there all the time .
i just thought , maybe after i blew the appy ,
i &apos;d be a good target
if you needed to pin something on someone .
it &apos;s paranoid . i get that .
i don &apos;t always trust people who are trying to help me .
yeah , yeah , you &apos;re a beaten dog ,
and you bite people who try to feed you .
i don &apos;t give a crap about your sad story .
you want to be a surgeon ,
you need to get the hell over it .
you burned a bridge with me .
how about you grow up before
you burn a bridge with every other attending
who tries to teach you something ?
50 centimeters of prime nerve .
great .
all right .
forceps , please . thank you .
is no one making small talk
because this is derek shepherd on the table ?
this is intricate work .
small talk is what keeps us awake .
well , uh ... a couple of days ago ,
i helped dr. kepner extract a malignant mass
from the gluteal area of a female patient .
it--it was an impressively sized mass .
who &apos;s gonna tell dr. shepherd
that he &apos;ll never operate again
because ross &apos; idea of gossip is ,
he saw april kepner take a lump off an ass ?
brooks , suction .
all of , not half of it .
sorry .
he &apos;s got a bunch of tattoos .
wonder if it &apos;s some sort of a gang thing .
i had--
the chatter isn &apos;t helping me ,
and your experience with gangland youth
has little bearing on how we treat this patient .
what the hell was that ?
i thought this was supposed to be amicable .
we &apos;re getting divorced because of the lawsuit ?
it will significantly increase your chances--
you didn &apos;t want to mention it ?
i want you to get the money .
i want all of you to get the money ,
and i knew there was a very real chance
that you would reject the idea
simply because i suggested it .
oh , right . because i &apos;m so simple @-@ minded and petulant .
you &apos;ve been known to--
where do you get off
making some kind of unilateral decision about our marriage ?
how about the fact that you moved across the country
and didn &apos;t have the courage to do what i did
and simply ask for a divorce ?
oh , god . so this is ballsy ,
you hiding behind the lawsuit ?
you couldn &apos;t just admit to me ,
or--or--or god sake , yourself , that you wanted out .
you have to let this stupid plane crash
make the decision for you .
i chose the airline !
you like it better when i decide ? !
i chose the airline !
we had to make a budget cut of 4 % ...
and we had a line item of emergency transportation .
we never used it , and we had a ...
fancy charter company ,
and i chose a ... cheaper one .
you want to know why it was cheaper ?
you didn &apos;t build the plane .
people are dead .
or fly it .
i thought you were dead .
you &apos;re not responsible .
someone has to be .
i mean , it takes a lot of small mistakes
to destroy something ,
and it &apos;s really easy for everybody involved
just to say , &quot; ah , i just did this one small thing . &quot;
a bunch of people made it possible ...
for a bad plane to take off
with you , meredith , and derek ,
and arizona , and ...
and i am one of those people .
i think i &apos;m having a dream
a really hot doctor came to take care of me .
this really hot doctor is leaving you to go to a party .
callie said it could not have gone better .
do you have any pain ?
no .
how &apos;s lizzie ?
uh , she &apos;s doing well .
she was still sleeping last time i checked .
i &apos;ll swing by on my way out .
it may have worked .
and we &apos;re back on the shoes .
please don &apos;t even say it out loud .
it makes me feel even more stupid .
just ... tell her that i wasn &apos;t feeling well .
you &apos;ve gotta be kidding me .
do not belittle me , okay ? you have no idea what it &apos;s like--
oh , trust me , trust me ,
i am intimately familiar with what &apos;s going on ,
and i &apos;m over it .
you are exactly the same person you were before ,
just minus a leg .
you think it &apos;s nothing ?
no . oh , no , no , no , no .
i think it &apos;s everything .
and--and you know what ? it has been ... for months .
and i have been supportive for months .
but there comes a point where you have to suck it up
and stop whining and start living .
okay , so you have one leg .
it &apos;s a wedding . it &apos;s a wedding .
and weddings are sweet and beautiful
and n @-@ no one &apos;s gonna notice the stupid leg
because everybody &apos;s gonna be looking at bailey ,
and maybe for one night ,
our lives can be about something
other than that damn leg .
my whole life is about that leg .
i haven &apos;t had sex in five months because of the leg .
enough about the leg !
everything went smoothly . your vitals look great .
and derek is awake , and he &apos;s in good shape .
meredith , i &apos;m pushy .
i get that .
some people find it endearing ,
and some people really don &apos;t .
but , um ... you don &apos;t have to want
derek &apos;s truckload of sisters in your life .
yeah . you are a pain in the ass .
and i barely know you .
okay , so ...
i &apos;m not very good at this .
but i &apos;m gonna try .
i &apos;m gonna show you something ,
but you have to promise not to blab it to the whole family .
okay .
promise ?
yeah .
okay .
you ?
really ?
we &apos;re having a baby .
let her drive you , miranda .
no , mom .
i just need five minutes with none of you touching me .
wh--
so did she bring her friend or what ?
oh , come on .
he &apos;s the guy ?
was the lawsuit the only reason you asked for a divorce ?
there are many reasons .
you were ...
done
a long time ago .
i &apos;m asking about you .
okay , let me put it another way .
i wanted to--to try again .
i was gonna ask you if we could try again ,
and you said , &quot; i want a divorce . &quot;
oh . sorry .
i should throw this thing out the window .
hello .
sir , this is barrett in the e.r.
your wife is on her way here ,
paramedics say she &apos;s vomiting blood .
what ?
adele ?
she &apos;s hypotensive .
um , hey , turn the car around .
we need to go to the emergency room ...
at seattle grace hospital right now .
wasn &apos;t this stupid thing supposed to start already ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m here , sweetheart .
why is this happening ?
we &apos;re gonna find out .
how much blood has she lost ?
at least a liter , a liter and a half .
it started about 45 minutes ago .
oh , god ! it hurts .
hang more l.r.
no , not if she &apos;s lost that much blood .
she needs a transfusion and an n.g.tube.
i &apos;ve got this , okay ?
sir , she &apos;s your wife . step back .
get me an n.g.tube , son .
i can do this .
get me an n.g.tube right now .
okay , i got it .
you hear me ?
get out of the way .
okay . central line kit , please .
yes , doctor .
yeah , yeah , leah . get me out of this dress now .
adele , hi .
can you look at me ?
hey , we &apos;re gonna take good care of you , okay ?
she &apos;s having ventricular couplets .
all right , watch for v @-@ tach .
prep the i.j.
okay , you &apos;re gonna be fine , baby . we got you .
all right . get the guide wire ready .
she &apos;s losing consciousness , bailey !
damn it . all right .
uh , barrett , take this . do a femoral line instead .
uh , leah , intubation tray .
oh , god , adele .
oh , god .
oh , come on , come on , come on .
oh , straight to voice mail .
um , it &apos;s possible that i may have , by mistake ,
said that if she had any doubts , she should flee .
what ?
why ?
well , i kind of said that marriage is like a dance of death ,
and that leaving him at the altar
would be a painful but efficient out .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
i was joking ... ohh .
and she was nervous , okay ?
and she wasn &apos;t sure if it was the wedding or the whole thing .
the marriage ?
she was nervous .
how nervous ?
how nervous was she , callie ?
the body doesn &apos;t know the difference
between nerves and excitement , panic and doubt ,
the beginning , and the end .
the body just tells you to get the hell out .
sometimes you ignore it .
that &apos;s the reasonable thing to do .
but sometimes you listen .
you &apos;re supposed to trust your gut , right ?
when your body says run ...
