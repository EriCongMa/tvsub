gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
it &apos;s time to pass the &quot; gossip girl &quot; baton .
let someone else see if they can outshine me .
welcome to your future
as gossip girl 3.0 .
the power is now in your hands .
so i guess we &apos;re cousins .
up until ten minutes ago , i didn &apos;t even know i had a family .
please tell me we have an offer
that &apos;ll at least keep &quot; the spectator &quot; afloat .
yes , i do know diana payne .
you &apos;re covering for who really gave me the blood--
elizabeth .
she didn &apos;t want you to know .
you remember the woman with the locket
i had you look for a couple years ago ?
yeah , my mother . i need to find her again .
&quot; as for the rest of my estate , i leave to you , ivy dickens . &quot;
i think it would be best if you left .
i was just gonna say the same thing .
this is my apartment now .
you don &apos;t have a case . i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
the court will decide that .
in the meantime , your assets will be frozen .
i told chuck he doesn &apos;t have my heart anymore .
i realized it belongs to someone else .
if she defaults on the marriage , the dowry can be reinstated .
i have a way that your family doesn &apos;t
have to pay the grimaldis a thing ,
and you get your divorce in the process .
fine .
you know you love me .
every once in a while ,
a life @-@ changing event will arrive with fanfare and excitement .
miss blair ,
package from legal firm of kier , grandinetti and booth .
divorce papers !
oh , sweet legal freedom !
thank god . i thought louis was gonna drag this on forever .
georgina move fast .
what do you think she do to make happen ?
it &apos;s best we don &apos;t think , dorota .
georgina went black ops on this one ,
and while i &apos;m sure i &apos;m eventually gonna pay a price
for my plausible deniability ,
right now i &apos;m just gonna enjoy the bliss of ignorance .
which means i can stop avoiding them and call dan !
oh ! now we can date outside the confines of the 7 @-@ 1 @-@ 8 .
we can walk down madison avenue hand in hand
without having to worry about louis changing his mind .
in my experience , most turning points in our lives
don &apos;t announce themselves .
if anything , they tend to creep up quietly ...
when we &apos;re least expecting them ...
and force us to make a decision that isn &apos;t so easy .
不过在那之前 我有一件事必须完成
any word from jack or andrew tyler yet ?
jack &apos;s not returning my calls , and it &apos;s been a week ,
and andrew still hasn &apos;t been able to track down elizabeth .
so now that you know she &apos;s your mother for sure ,
you think you , uh , want a relationship with her ?
i haven &apos;t decided yet .
and since she &apos;s m.i.a. , i don &apos;t have to .
so in the meantime , i &apos;m gonna head down to the spa
and meet mandy and micheala from hospitality
and catch a steam . coming ?
gotta get to the office .
diana &apos;s finally making an appearance today .
oh . the two of you running &quot; the spectator &quot; again .
ready for combat ?
there &apos;s no reason to think that we &apos;ll have anything to fight about .
she &apos;s an investor . i &apos;m still editor in chief .
i &apos;m not worried about it .
i told myself the same thing before my night
with the australian women &apos;s softball team .
that ended up with a fractured rib
and a tattoo of a kangaroo that i didn &apos;t know i had for a month .
all right , listen , diana and i may have
ended things badly on a personal level .
but professionally , we always worked well together , man .
and what does lola think about you working with your ex ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t , uh ,
exactly told her about my past with diana .
how could she not know ?
i mean , you were all over &quot; gossip girl , &quot; &quot; page six . &quot;
no , lola has no interest
in the upper east side social scene .
but even if she did ,
what diana and i used to be to each other
doesn &apos;t matter anymore .
maybe not to you , but why else would diana be back ?
it can &apos;t be for a love of journalism .
well , i don &apos;t know about that ,
but once i get the lay of the land with diana ,
i &apos;ll tell lola everything .
well , you sound like you &apos;ve got it all figured out .
just don &apos;t be surprised
if you end up with an angry ex @-@ girlfriend
and a tattoo of a kangaroo .
和
hey ! congratulations .
dorota told me it &apos;s your first official day as a single woman .
it &apos;s true .
i am finally freed of the shackles of royal matrimony
and louis &apos; horrible family .
well , now that you &apos;re ready to rejoin the civilian population ,
how do you plan to spend your first day
as plain blair waldorf ?
oh . sure . yeah , with ...
with dan . i &apos;m--
i know it hasn &apos;t been easy , but i am happy for you .
oh . of course .
a &quot; gossip girl &quot; blast about my divorce coming through .
how does she know everything so fast ?
she probably has someone staked out in front of the building .
you know what &apos;s strange ?
ever since the real gossip girl &apos;s been back ,
i &apos;ve barely been mentioned .
i just ...
i wish that there was a way to stay off her radar forever .
oh , please . it is your destiny to be gossip @-@ worthy .
what ?
tonight , you are modeling a line of lingerie
named after you at kiki de montparnasse .
gossip girl won &apos;t be able to resist .
you &apos;re always her number one target .
you don &apos;t have any brilliant ideas
how to push me off the top of her list ?
so you really want out ?
i just--i &apos;m ready to move on with my life ,
and i can &apos;t do that
with gossip girl tracking my every move .
well , you need to replace yourself .
find a new serena .
use your influence to anoint her the new &quot; it girl . &quot;
retain control but stay out of the spotlight yourself .
okay . well , where do i start ?
at the beginning , of course , with the defining moment .
i mean , you didn &apos;t really become serena van der woodsen
until you got naked on that aircraft carrier .
you don &apos;t need to make it sound like a porno .
we were on a school trip .
and i wasn &apos;t naked . i was wearing a dress .
a white , wet dress .
the photo landed on &quot; gossip girl , &quot; and that was it .
it &apos;s gonna take a moment like that
to create the next serena van der woodsen
okay , what about you ?
now that you &apos;re saying good @-@ bye to being a princess ,
does that mean you &apos;re ready to reclaim your crown as queen b. ?
so if it &apos;s your mom &apos;s sister &apos;s family ,
that means you gain ... what , an aunt ? an uncle ?
yeah , and two cousins-- eric and serena .
actually , i &apos;d kind of like
to get to know serena a little bit better , but ...
the whole family overnight is kind of a lot .
you can &apos;t get to know her unless you spend time together .
well , so what ? i just ... call her up and say ,
&quot; hey , we &apos;re related . let &apos;s hang out &quot; ?
it &apos;s so random .
wow , your mom really screwed you up , didn &apos;t she ?
nate .
what are you doing here ?
hey . i &apos;m just on my way to work .
nate , this is my friend aidan from back home .
hey .
we went to acting camp together .
he--he &apos;s checking out julliard .
uh ... i &apos;m gonna grab a paper .
i wanna check out the reviews for &quot; peter and the starcatchers . &quot;
okay .
well , uh , you &apos;ve never mentioned him before .
do i sense a little jealousy ?
no , aidan is just a friend .
and besides , he &apos;s not my type .
you are .
you wanna play hooky with us ?
i would , but i can &apos;t .
i got that new investor coming in . i gotta go meet with her .
oh , that &apos;s right . what &apos;s her name--diana payne ?
what do you know about her ?
uh , well , i know she doesn &apos;t like it when people are late ,
so i gotta run . see you guys later .
that was weird , wasn &apos;t it ?
i mean , he mentioned that woman and then he just took off .
what are you doing ?
oh , there &apos;s this site called &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i &apos;m just gonna see if there &apos;s anything about her on there .
wow . she is hot .
so after that , we have a cindy sherman exhibit
代表有 《 办公室杀手 》 等
we can check out at the m.o.m.a.
and then tonight , there &apos;s a new restaurant that opened--
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , dan .
cindy sherman and her unflattering self @-@ portraits aside ,
it sounds like you planned a perfect day .
but it &apos;s going to have to wait .
well , the royal seal is missing on my divorce papers ,
and i don &apos;t want to let louis get me on a technicality .
uh , well , if it &apos;s something that small ,
then maybe it could be resolved today .
oh , i &apos;m sure louis &apos; lawyers are gone for the day .
the monegasque work very short hours .
okay , well , i just want to spend the day with you .
so maybe we could just hang out here ?
oh , uh , serena &apos;s around .
we--we shouldn &apos;t rub it in her face .
i &apos;ll call you later .
song lyrics .
vanya and--and i love karaoke .
dorota , while your reputation for loyalty is unassailable ,
you and i both know something is going on here .
so why don &apos;t you just leave the song lyrics on the table
and step out of the room for a moment ?
you won &apos;t see a thing .
only because i worry .
sometimes even the best laid plans fall apart ...
how &apos;s that ?
excellent . just get the right @-@ hand side down a bit .
hello , darling . did you miss me ?
what the hell are you doing ?
you didn &apos;t really think
you &apos;d get to keep your office , did you ?
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re gonna love your new cubicle .
or you hit a wall when you were expecting a door .
hey .
hey , lola . what &apos;s up ?
i just found out that new investor in &quot; the spectator &quot;
is diana payne , nate &apos;s ex @-@ girlfriend .
he totally lied to me about her .
i don &apos;t know what to do . i really like him .
but every now and then , you get lucky
and the universe delivers the perfect solution .
you know what ? um ...
i &apos;m actually really glad you came to me ,
because i know exactly what to do .
come on . let &apos;s go .
get ready , lola .
because whatever serena wants , lola &apos;s gonna get .
just get out of my office , please .
i &apos;m an investor in this paper ,
which i think entitles me to an office ,
and i choose this one .
no.being an investor means you don &apos;t actually need to be here .
you &apos;re not even a majority shareholder ,
and it &apos;s my name on the masthead .
not for long .
do you think advertisers are really gonna want to do business
with a kid now that i &apos;m back ?
well , they haven &apos;t had a problem with it so far .
oh , please . i &apos;ve done the research , my love .
advertising is down .
you never did understand that sex sells .
fortunately , i do ,
which is why i &apos;m co @-@ hosting
the &quot; down to your skivvie &quot; party tonight
at kiki de montparnasse .
after tonight , everyone is gonna be talking about
how i &apos;m back and your days are numbered .
you can &apos;t sponsor a &quot; spectator &quot; party without me .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m doing it on my own .
if you &apos;re inviting advertisers , everyone &apos;s gonna think
it &apos;s related to the paper , and i &apos;ll be there .
fine , if you insist .
i &apos;m assuming no plus @-@ one .
oh , i &apos;ll be bringing my girlfriend lola .
no problem .
enjoy your last day in here .
so ... what do you say we get out of here ,
go have a nice lunch at daniel ,
and go shopping at barney &apos;s ?
actually , i just came back from the city .
oh . i , uh , went to see ivy , and i asked her
if she would be willing to move out of the apartment
if we unfroze the assets .
what ? !
we do not negotiate with terrorists ,
especially ones from florida .
and you do not have the right to speak on my behalf .
i know , and i @-@ i didn &apos;t agree to anything .
but , sweetie , ivy did .
she offered to pack up and leave
just as soon as you call your lawyers .
we could have you back in the apartment
by the end of the day .
that is such a wonderful thing to do for me .
but unfreezing the assets means
letting ivy have my mother &apos;s money .
i don &apos;t think i can live with that .
you have enough money for generations of rhodes
to live comfortably .
does that exhale mean
that you &apos;ll call the lawyer and unfreeze the assets ?
yes . fine .
you &apos;re right .
good . so ...
i &apos;ll start packing , and then we &apos;ll go celebrate .
your mother &apos;s been living in vienna for the past six months .
i have an address and a mobile number ,
but i haven &apos;t made contact yet .
how do you want me to proceed ?
i &apos;m not sure .
the fact that she was harder to find
than a fugitive isn &apos;t lost on me .
clearly , the woman doesn &apos;t want to be found .
i don &apos;t know that i can advise you , chuck .
at this point , maybe you need a friend
more than you need a private investigator .
is there anyone in your life who got to know elizabeth
the last time she was here ?
maybe you wanna talk to them ,
figure out what it is you really want and what to expect
before you pursue this any further .
the one person who was there the whole way through
is the one person that &apos;s not in my life anymore .
blair waldorf .
then why did you pay her dowry ?
she doesn &apos;t know i did .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want her to find out , ever .
okay .
but even if that is the case ,
does that mean that you can &apos;t talk to her ?
thank you so much , tracy .
it &apos;s perfect .
oh , great .
we &apos;re so excited
you &apos;ll be modeling &quot; the serena &quot; tonight .
feel free to browse ,
and if you see anything you like , just let me know .
okay .
so am i totally overreacting ?
about nate , i mean .
oh , and that looked amazing on you .
oh , thank you .
uh , look , nate is a great guy , but diana is aggressive .
and i don &apos;t know why she &apos;s back ,
but it &apos;s safe to say it has something to do with him .
well , i &apos;m not interested in competing with someone else .
well , it &apos;s not about competing .
even if there was no diana ,
your whole &quot; not wanting to be a part of his world &quot; thing
is not a good idea .
i mean , he &apos;s your boyfriend . part of being in a relationship
is sharing each other &apos;s interests .
i do-- everything but parties
and the upper east side social order .
yeah , well , like it or not ,
that &apos;s a big part of his life and work .
and if you don &apos;t start meeting halfway ,
you leave room for someone who will , like diana .
so ... what ? what do i do ?
try this on .
it &apos;s gorgeous , but i couldn &apos;t ... wow !
especially because it costs more than a semester at julliard .
not for us it doesn &apos;t .
you heard tracy . she said it &apos;s on them .
come on . it &apos;s one of the many perks of being an &quot; it girl &quot;
come on !
come on ! we need to get out of here !
blair has the papers , but she hasn &apos;t signed them .
now that us as a couple is a reality ,
maybe it &apos;s freaking her out .
yeah , i think you &apos;re just kind of humphrey @-@ ing out here , man .
the editor in chief is chitchatting with his bro
instead of working .
and you wonder why the paper isn &apos;t doing so well .
the most recent numbers .
dismal .
seriously ? diana is the only investor you could find ?
yeah , well , chuck was gonna step in , but the timing was off
and , uh , he wasn &apos;t liquid enough .
chuck bass wasn &apos;t liquid ? how is that possible ?
i shouldn &apos;t have even brought it up .
why ? does , uh , does this have to do with blair ?
oh , nate . if chuck did something , you gotta tell me .
oh , it &apos;s nothing bad . in fact , it &apos;s good .
i don &apos;t know why chuck insists on keeping it quiet .
well , if it &apos;s good , then what &apos;s the big deal , nate ?
you , uh , you know what i &apos;m up against here . come on .
all right , fine . but you didn &apos;t hear it from me , okay ?
chuck didn &apos;t have the money
because he paid off blair &apos;s dowry .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s why she didn &apos;t sign the papers .
she must have found out ,
now she &apos;s having second thoughts .
oh , he was just trying to do a nice thing for blair .
come on . you really believe that ?
this is chuck we &apos;re talking about .
i gotta go .
why you lie to mr. dan about signing the papers ?
sneak up on me like that again ,
and i &apos;m gonna start making you wear a bell .
i want answer .
divorce is a private matter . you &apos;ll see for yourself someday .
now if you wanna make yourself useful ,
call the car around .
only if you tell me why you don &apos;t sign the papers .
otherwise , you take taxi .
i &apos;m going to do it .
i just need a little more time .
for what ?
it--it makes no sense ,
but i feel like ...
once i sign those papers ,
i &apos;m closing the door on something that ...
i &apos;m not quite ready to let go of .
marriage to louis ?
no .
then what ?
oh , my god .
so the entire upper east side
is seeing this photo of me right now ?
well , not just the upper east side .
it is the internet .
but hey , this is exactly what we wanted .
between that photo
and the news that you are the real charlie rhodes ,
everyone will be talking about you .
yeah , about how i &apos;m an exhibitionist
with a freak for a mom .
oh , i just got an e @-@ mail from tracy at kiki de montparnasse .
我想让她今晚在蒙帕纳斯当模特 必须要答应我
she wants you to model at the party tonight .
no . no , no , no . no , that &apos;s not gonna happen .
oh , come on . what better way to show nate
you &apos;re willing to make more of an effort ?
and not to mention , diana is one of the party sponsors .
you think nate &apos;s gonna be going to this ?
of course he will .
i shouldn &apos;t jump to any conclusions .
i should probably just go talk to him myself .
i &apos;ll let you know , okay ?
um , yeah . sure .
lola , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want to freak you out ,
but , um , you may wanna check &quot; gossip girl &quot; again .
word is that diana and nate are going to tonight &apos;s
&quot; down to your skivvies &quot; party together .
guess their relationship just went from business to pleasure .
i thought that i moved on ,
that this whole business with my mother was in the past .
i could live with the uncertainty
because the woman i met ,
i didn &apos;t care if she was my mother or not .
then i found out she did this extraordinary thing for me .
is it wrong to think that changes things ?
no .
of course not , but ...
what i don &apos;t understand is what you want from me .
just someone to talk to , i guess .
someone who &apos;ll understand . you--you met her .
you know what i went through .
is it worth it to try and reach out again ?
i don &apos;t know , chuck ,
but i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m the one to ask .
why ? because of humphrey ?
blair , i &apos;m not trying to work an angle here .
i &apos;m simply coming to you as a friend .
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re working right back into my life
and you &apos;re using your mother to do it .
blair ...
i &apos;m sorry if i sound harsh ,
but we both know we &apos;ve never been good as friends .
there &apos;s always been an agenda .
am i wrong ?
no , you &apos;re not wrong .
chuck , what are you doing here ?
i thought i was coming to see a friend for advice .
apparently , i made a mistake .
well , what &apos;s going on ?
you know how i got that blood transfusion at the hospital ?
it was elizabeth .
apparently , she is my mother ,
but she &apos;s pulled a disappearing act .
i &apos;m trying to to decide whether it &apos;s worth it to track her down ,
try and build a relationship .
well , if you &apos;re asking me , i &apos;d say do it .
i mean , i know it &apos;s scary ,
but when it comes to reconnecting with family ,
it &apos;s--it &apos;s worth the risk .
thanks .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not true .
then why was it on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
i have no idea .
why should i believe that , nate ?
you already lied to me
about having a relationship with diana .
okay , you &apos;re right .
right ? and that was dumb ,
and i &apos;m really sorry about that .
but there is nothing going on right now .
then why do you keep nervously looking at the door ?
because diana has made it clear to me
that she &apos;s determined to push me out .
and the last thing i need
is a fight with my girlfriend at the office .
okay . well , we can discuss it tonight then .
i can &apos;t tonight . i have to go to this party .
what ? you don &apos;t even like events like this ,
and the only reason you wanna go
is because you think i &apos;m lying to you , and i &apos;m not .
this is a work event ,
not a personal one , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry .
is there anything you wanna tell me ?
let me guess .
you saw on &quot; gossip girl &quot; that chuck came by .
i can explain .
no , you don &apos;t have to .
i @-@ i already know about the dowry .
what are you talking about ?
about how , uh , how chuck paid your dowry .
listen , if that &apos;s why you didn &apos;t sign the divorce papers ,
i just wish you would tell me .
no . i had no idea chuck paid it .
none . i thought it was georgina .
i gotta go .
where ?
to find him .
&quot; him &quot; who ?
chuck ?
hello ?
this is john rosen , ivy dickens &apos; lawyer .
my client got a call from a bank officer , informing her
that there was a cashier &apos;s check waiting for her ?
yes , my , uh , wife unfroze the assets .
that &apos;s what ivy thought .
so she packed up ,
left her keys , and went to go get the check .
but when she got to the bank ,
they had no idea what she was talking about .
i couldn &apos;t help but overhear your little lover &apos;s spat .
i &apos;m sorry lola won &apos;t be coming tonight ,
but maybe it presents an opportunity .
what if you and i went together ?
well , i appreciate the olive branch ,
but i think it sends the wrong message .
lola &apos;s still my girlfriend ,
and i don &apos;t want to hurt her .
you and i know it &apos;s just business .
what &apos;s the risk ?
what &apos;s the point ?
it looks good to advertisers , us playing nice .
let &apos;s use this night to send a message to the town
that &quot; the spectator &quot; is back to being a well @-@ oiled machine .
nate swears there &apos;s nothing going on with diana ,
but he also refuses to bring me as his date tonight .
i &apos;m sorry .
well ... you just have two options , then .
well , there &apos;s stay home and do nothing ,
or you could come with me to the party and you model .
tell tracy i &apos;ll be there ,
with a date .
diana better watch out . i &apos;m ready .
everyone &apos;s been talking about
manhattan &apos;s latest arrival , lola rhodes .
and word is that tonight
you &apos;re going to see a whole lot more of her .
they do not have parties like this in florida .
they barely have dental hygiene in florida .
ooh , open bar . be right back .
hey , nice touch with the hot guy .
oh , thanks . so have you seen him yet ?
hello ! how are you ?
okay , don &apos;t tell me they &apos;re not on a date .
and she &apos;s even more beautiful in person . that &apos;s annoying .
don &apos;t worry .
as soon as she sees you model ,
she &apos;s not only gonna see
you &apos;re a force to be reckoned with and back off ,
but you and nate will be
the hottest couple on the party circuit .
you will surpass me as new york &apos;s &quot; it girl &quot; in no time .
oh , no , serena , no one could surpass you ,
especially not me .
yes , you can , and you will .
and believe me , nothing would make me happier .
come on . let &apos;s go find tracy so we can start getting ready .
actually , i think i &apos;m gonna introduce myself to diana first .
thanks .
go for it . good luck .
hey , nate . you remember aidan .
yeah , w @-@ what are you doing here ?
careful , nate . you don &apos;t want to cause a scene .
this is a business party , after all .
hi . i &apos;m lola rhodes . i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve ever met .
um , this is my date , aidan hill .
oh . it &apos;s a pleasure .
i &apos;m surprised to see you , lola .
nate said you wouldn &apos;t be making it .
actually , i was invited to model tonight .
what ? i @-@ i didn &apos;t know that .
well , why would you ? it &apos;s not like we were coming together .
maybe diana and i should , uh , get a drink
while you two ... talk .
actually , nate and i need to go and say hello to a few people .
lola , maybe it &apos;s time for you to show aidan
what you &apos;re modeling tonight .
otherwise , you might lose two men to me in one day .
i brought lattes to help us pack .
i heard from ivy &apos;s lawyer .
she got a call from the bank ,
saying there was a cashier &apos;s check waiting for her .
so she packed up and moved out ,
and when she went to collect it , it wasn &apos;t there .
do you know anything about this ?
yes , i never called the lawyers .
but now that she &apos;s out ,
i need to legally make sure she can &apos;t get back in .
and the call about the check ?
it was a ruse to get her out of the apartment .
rufus , you &apos;re not gonna get me to feel any remorse about this .
ivy lied about who she was ,
she manipulated te mother while she lay dying ,
and she stole our apartment .
look , frankly ,
i think she deserves exactly what she &apos;s getting .
but you didn &apos;t just lie to her . you lied to me .
but , rufus , i &apos;m sorry i kept it from you ,
because i knew you wouldn &apos;t be comfortable with it .
i had to protect you from the truth .
this isn &apos;t what a marriage is , lily .
we have to be honest with each other .
i know , but this was an extreme situation .
i did what had to be done .
you know , maybe i &apos;m just seeing more clearly
because of the view from brooklyn .
but i &apos;m not okay with this .
look , rufus , i know you &apos;re upset ,
but how can you be so righteous ?
we &apos;re talking about someone that stole from us .
oh , my god . can we please just ...
stop fighting
and just pack and go home ?
yeah , i don &apos;t know , lily .
right now this loft feels a lot more like home
than our apartment .
as you can see , nate , everyone &apos;s very excited i &apos;m back .
no one more so than you , apparently .
which makes me wonder--
it &apos;s a buyer &apos;s market right now for newspapers .
if you really wanted one ,
you could &apos;ve gone anywhere .
what are you getting at ?
i think you came back for me .
oh ! you &apos;re adorable .
oh , i &apos;m serious .
i bet you spent the last few months in l.a. ,
trying to convince yourself that i was nothing ,
just a fling with a younger guy .
but the fact is , you couldn &apos;t get over me .
really ?
then explain this .
come with me .
where &apos;s my date going ?
exactly where we want him to .
blair , what are you doing here ?
looking for you .
at first , i wasn &apos;t sure i could find you ,
but then i realized all i had to do was
look for the lingerie models .
so tell me ,
is it true ?
did you pay my dowry ?
who told you that ?
tell me if it &apos;s true .
w @-@ why does it matter ?
i knew it .
you thought you could buy me back ,
just like you thought you could sell me for your hotel .
you &apos;ve got it all wrong .
that &apos;s why you showed up with that ruse today
about friendship .
you bought my divorce and you came to collect your prize .
then why didn &apos;t i collect ?
i swear , i did not want you to know about the dowry .
the only people that knew were nate and andrew tyler .
i just wanted you to be free .
whom you choose to love with that freedom is up to you .
i &apos;m sorry , blair .
i thought you knew .
you &apos;re right . he &apos;s a good actor .
yeah , i don &apos;t think he &apos;s acting all that much .
wait , you two are working together ?
w--is this some kind of revenge on diana ?
yes , but let me explain it to you .
i ... i can &apos;t believe this .
you ? whatever .
but , lola ...
you totally used me .
just go talk to her .
we got what we needed , all right ?
uh @-@ oh , nate .
looks like your dirty movie just got an unhappy ending .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
filming you and aidan .
oh , and he &apos;s 16 , by the way .
not sure how you &apos;re gonna run &quot; the spectator &quot; from jail .
and you recorded it ?
yep . you have not lost your touch , by the way .
so what do you think--
the front page of &quot; the spectator &quot;
or just let gossip girl run with it ?
go ahead .
send the video wherever you want .
if what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name really is 16,
you &apos;ll be in prison right there next to me
for recording and distributing child pornography .
i &apos;m gonna go enjoy the show .
see you at work tomorrow .
are you okay ?
i guess i &apos;m just
not used to seeing chuck do anything selfless .
yeah , well , people can surprise us , even chuck .
i saw the divorce papers .
the seal was there , but they weren &apos;t signed .
i thought you must &apos;ve known that he paid the dowry .
no .
this has nothing to do with chuck
or the dowry .
well , then--then why ?
my whole life , i wanted to be a princess .
and when i met louis , it was ...
this whole whirlwind of royalty and tiaras ,
and it seemed like my dream was coming true .
i mean , i may have married a prince ,
but i never really got to be a princess .
i know it &apos;s silly , but ...
i think it was just one more loss i needed to mourn
before moving on .
serena , when i first came to you ,
it was because i needed advice and i wanted yours .
oh , and when you agreed to come with me to the party ?
that was ...
because i needed to make it look like i was in a fight with nate
in front of diana .
i know you really want this &quot; it girl &quot; title for me ,
and i &apos;m so flattered
that you think i could ever live up to it ,
but to be honest with you , serena ,
i @-@ i don &apos;t care about that kind of thing .
and neither does nate ,
so i &apos;m so sorry and i hope we can still be friends .
well , why would i want to be ?
i put myself on the line for you , lola ,
and then all you did was let me down .
okay , ladies , time to get in position .
there &apos;s just been a small change in the plans .
yeah , lola &apos;s not modeling .
what ?
she can explain .
uh , serena , i need to talk to you .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry about lola .
i know it &apos;s an inconvenience .
it &apos;s not that .
after that photograph came out today ,
we thought we &apos;d get even more buzz
if we changed the name of &quot; the serena &quot; to &quot; the lola . &quot;
so i need you to model something else .
seriously ? i mean , a few minutes ago ,
that would &apos;ve been great news .
but now ... you asked me to do this .
i have a model to take your place while you go change .
we &apos;d love to see you in something else .
sorry , but you can &apos;t go out there .
we can &apos;t have serena being the face of &quot; the lola . &quot;
please , come with me .
spotted--
serena van der woodsen blowing off the kiki fashion show .
looks like this party just went from so hot to so not .
给我密码
i just wanted to let you know how sorry i am about last night .
and i really appreciate everything you were doing
with the whole &quot; it girl &quot; thing .
no , it &apos;s okay . i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have pushed you to do it .
it &apos;s clearly not for you .
actually , it might be .
i got a call from an agent this morning .
she saw my photo on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
and wants to set up a meeting with me .
what does , um , what does nate have to say about it ?
i thought he didn &apos;t care about you being an &quot; it girl . &quot;
yeah , i know . he doesn &apos;t , but , um ...
he &apos;s supportive of my acting career , so he &apos;s happy .
and anyway , it &apos;s how you use your power that counts , right ?
sure .
how do you plan to use yours ?
well , i was thinking that ,
instead of being an &quot; it girl &quot; like you--
beautiful and unobtainable--
that maybe i could be more of an &quot; every girl &quot; &quot;
you know , like , someone everyone can relate to .
i don &apos;t know . maybe that &apos;s dumb . is that stupid ?
no . no , no , i ... no , i just think , you know ,
these things usually come and go pretty quickly .
so i just--i wouldn &apos;t get too used to it , you know ?
but , um , there are some things that i have to do ,
so maybe i can call you later , and we can hang out ?
okay . yeah .
can we talk ?
sure .
i don &apos;t think i realized just how upset you were with me
till last night .
or how much you were willing to fight for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
i &apos;ve been putting my heart and soul into this paper .
of course i &apos;m gonna fight for it .
i &apos;d like us to find a way to work together .
well , i don &apos;t know how to do that anymore .
well ...
i could apologize , for starters ,
for not being honest with you from the very beginning
about being in business with your grandfather .
it was a terrible thing to do to you .
thank you .
is that it ?
well , i could apologize for last night . but ...
i thought that was a draw .
what about all the &quot; gossip girl &quot; sources you released ?
i didn &apos;t do that .
i thought you would &apos;ve found out by now .
after your grandfather intervened , it was all over .
i thought it would be easier for you to hate me .
and frankly , i @-@ i think i wanted to punish myself a little
for what i did to you .
so ...
about us working together--
what &apos;s that gonna look like ?
&quot; the spectator &quot; is yours .
i &apos;m just here in a support capacity .
in the meantime ,
i have some other business i need to take care of ,
and that &apos;s gonna be my main focus .
and ...
i found another office downstairs .
deal ?
deal .
there &apos;s one more thing i should come clean about .
you were right about me still having feelings for you .
i know you &apos;re with lola now , and i promise
i won &apos;t let my feelings get in the way of your relationship
or of our work .
let me know if you need me .
always good to see you ,
but you really didn &apos;t need to come all the way to the mark
to meet me , andrew .
you could &apos;ve just e @-@ mailed me elizabeth &apos;s information .
that &apos;s why i came .
i don &apos;t think you should contact her , chuck .
look , i appreciate you looking out for me ,
but i &apos;ve decided
i wanna try and have a relationship with my mother .
that &apos;s the thing . elizabeth is not your mother .
i made contact .
she swore it wasn &apos;t her who donated the blood .
said she was in a monastery in tibet at the time .
a monastery ? she &apos;s lying . she &apos;s good at that .
i looked into it .
her story checks out .
keep looking .
someone donated that blood .
i wanna know who .
what is this about ?
the sun hasn &apos;t set .
i feel like a prom queen doing the walk of shame .
you look like a princess .
now i &apos;m not gonna lie .
this is cubic zirconia
that i got from a costume shop .
but you &apos;ll sell it .
cubic zirconia does not touch this body .
put it on , blair .
i have hit rock bottom . what is going on ?
i , uh , i thought you should get to feel like a princess
one last time .
o.m.g. ! it &apos;s blair waldorf !
you look beautiful !
she &apos;s a real @-@ life princess !
let &apos;s get a picture with her ! please .
here !
yeah ! absolutely .
all right . everybody , smile !
smile bigger !
i love your crown !
so amazing ! we love you ! thank you ! bye !
thank you .
it turns out that lola staged that photo of herself
in a fireman &apos;s jacket .
how desperate .
doesn &apos;t she realize there can only be
one &quot; it girl &quot; for the upper east side ?
and that will always be serena van der woodsen .
nate archibald &apos;s office , please .
he &apos;s not available right now .
tell him it &apos;s lola .
he &apos;s in with diana . he asked not to be disturbed .
hey , lola ! can we get a picture ?
look this way , please !
come on , lola . look this way .
there you go .
nice .
you must be happy to be home .
um , very much , vanya . thank you .
i will go back down and get mr. humphrey &apos;s bags .
well , um , actually , this is it for now .
sometimes , we fight for something
only to discover by the time we get it ,
our goals have changed .
for some , it &apos;s too late .
the lines have been drawn ...
and the damage has been done .
but other times you get the thing you always wanted ...
only to find out it isn &apos;t what you really need .
get ready , kids . i &apos;m back ,
and this time , i &apos;m here to stay .
