agnes , cancel my appointments .
what appointments ?
wishful thinking .
it &apos;s called alternative energy ,
the key to a brighter tomorrow .
notice all the animals wearing sunglasses .
because it &apos;s a brighter tomorrow .
yeah .
my boys are in elementary school .
they don &apos;t make nearly as many dioramas as we do .
the whole environmental club is making them for green week .
and this afternoon in the cafeteria ,
we &apos;re having a bio @-@ diorama @-@ rama .
i heard one kid made a diorama
about a world without dioramas .
it &apos;s still cool if i sleep at your place tonight , right ?
totally . hey , since we &apos;re both done with classes ,
we can start the sleepover now .
let &apos;s get in our pajamas
and build a blanket fort .
let &apos;s do it .
a blanket fort . wow !
you can come hang out in it with us later if you want .
uh , thanks , but i think i &apos;ll find something
more grown @-@ up to do .
hmm . okay .
enjoy eating fiber and watching the mentalist .
britta , that wasn &apos;t nice .
i &apos;m sorry , shirley , but who wants to hang out
in a blanket fort with grown men in tiny underoos ?
hello ! so ... jeffrey ,
i was just looking over your class schedule .
why ?
uh ...
maybe it was a random spot @-@ check .
maybe it was a specific spot @-@ check .
maybe i &apos;m making a scrapbook .
the point is
you will not be receiving credit for your independent study :
conspiracy theories in u.s. history .
what ? why not ?
because the class doesn &apos;t exist .
and neither does the teacher-- professor professorson ?
what ? that &apos;s his name !
oh ...
it &apos;s dutch .
i think it means professor .
i think it means poppycock .
the ultimate jeff winger blow @-@ off class :
the one that doesn &apos;t exist .
now i have to audit an entire system for shenanigans ,
which means ... bye @-@ bye weekends .
bye @-@ bye writing at starbucks
till a certain persian barista asks me about my novel .
god , jeff !
it &apos;s one thing to blow off regular classes ,
but this devalues all the credits i work very hard for .
mm @-@ hmm .
can i defend myself
and say this is nuts ?
i &apos;ve been meeting with this professor
in his office every wednesday all semester .
professor professorson .
yes !
really ?
you &apos;re gonna commit to this ?
commit to what--reality ?
okay , then , please ... lead me
to professor professorson .
gladly .
this i gotta see .
i have always dreamt
of playing charades with you , jeffrey--
just not like this , not on dry land .
第二季第九集
oh , man !
you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
we &apos;re too big for this , aren &apos;t we ?
yeah .
but if we went two pillows higher in the corner ,
we could vault the ceiling ...
bump up the square footage .
make this a blanket fort for men .
well , here we are .
professor professorson &apos;s office .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s goin &apos; on .
you guys have to believe me .
i have spent a whole year studying conspiracy theories
with professor professorson right here !
wait ! of course !
conspiracy theories .
this is a test .
he &apos;s teaching me about real conspiracies
by erasing his existence !
oh , my god . do you know what this means ?
that &apos;s how stupid jeff thinks other people are .
i always knew you were lazy , but i didn &apos;t realize
that you would stoop to such pathetic lies !
one man &apos;s lies are another man &apos;s truth ...
wouldn &apos;t you say , jeff ?
i &apos;m sorry . and who are you ?
i &apos;m professor professorson .
ha . wow , you ... you really had me going there
for a second , professor .
i thought i was going insane .
precisely .
an actual conspiracy to round out your education
in conspiracies and theories thereof .
your real name ... is professor professorson ?
my family name is professorberg ,
but we changed it when we were fleeing from the nazis .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;ve probably never heard of me
since i primarily teach night school .
my faculty i.d.
oh , well , i ...
guess i never stuck around late enough
to meet you night school professors .
tv &apos;s gotten crazy good , you know .
i have to take this .
thank you for indulging me , dean .
jeff , read chapters 10 through 12 of douglas
and see you next week .
that is ...
if i still exist .
see you , professor .
sorry to doubt you , jeffrey .
more importantly , out with this audit ,
back to chapter one of time desk :
the chronicles of dean dangerous .
that is gonna be the worst book i &apos;ll ever read cover to cover .
i &apos;m a terrible friend .
i accused you of being a lying cheat .
can you ever forgive me ?
sure .
here &apos;s the thing , though .
i &apos;ve never seen that guy in my life !
what ? that wasn &apos;t professor professorson ?
there is no professor professorson !
i made him up ! i forged a form
with a phony teacher and class for a free credit !
i knew it !
oh , you lying cheat !
wait . then--
who was that ?
i don &apos;t know !
wait , what ?
i don &apos;t know !
what should we do ?
i think we should grab some lunch .
i &apos;m serious .
so am i.
i just saw fat neil head to the cafeteria
with that look in his eye .
we got ten minutes to grab the last lima bean .
jeff , you made up a professor ,
and he just appeared out of thin air .
you &apos;re not the least bit curious how that happened ?
my latest theory ? maybe i &apos;m a god .
i &apos;ve denied the signs for too long .
this is so typical .
you &apos;re just gonna blow off what happened .
yes , especially when not blowing it off
might cost me my free credit .
now , do me a favor .
be very un @-@ annie and blow it off too .
oh , sure . i &apos;ll just blow it off .
i &apos;ll just blow everything off .
heck , i guess i &apos;ll just blow off walkin &apos; !
okay .
i &apos;ll just blow off standing .
i &apos;m just blowin &apos; everything off !
maybe i &apos;ll blow off talking language .
okay .
hey , bros , what &apos;s the ha ... ps ...
sweet fort !
can i come inside ?
you could , pavel ...
or ... maybe the inside could come to you .
how would you characterize
the amount of blankets and pillows you have ?
a butt load ?
i get wicked cold , bros ,
and mad sleepy .
if you &apos;re here to help me take my diorama
to the bio @-@ diorama @-@ rama , i can do it myself .
yes . you made that clear
in your 11th &quot; i can do it myself &quot; text .
you even work too hard at passive @-@ aggression ,
you know that ?
hey , so ...
do you know anything about greendale &apos;s night school ?
yeah . i &apos;m assuming it &apos;s the worst thing
you could ever hope to be in ...
only at night .
damn it , annie . have you been playing detective ?
you are gonna nancy screw me out of my credit .
relax . all i did was ask the administration desk
if i could borrow a faculty directory .
take a look at this .
is that professorson ?
his real name is professor woolley ,
and he actually does teach night school here .
why would someone you &apos;ve never met
pretend to be your phony professor ?
he was already carrying falsified faculty credentials .
do you know what this means ?
yes . you are making me do work for my fake conspiracy class !
exactly . there &apos;s a conspiracy here .
a dark , vast conspiracy
that may just go all the way to the top .
this is greendale , annie .
if there &apos;s a conspiracy ,
it goes all the way to slightly below the middle .
wait a minute .
something &apos;s wrong .
my car won &apos;t start .
hold on one second .
hello .
tell your little friend
to stop snooping around night school ,
otherwise , things might get ... explosive .
annie !
you okay ?
yeah .
probably didn &apos;t need to tackle you .
probably not .
looks like someone sent us a message ...
a tiny , thoroughly underwhelming message .
i hope you &apos;ve already laid out your outfit
for tomorrow morning ...
because we &apos;re going to night school .
i stole these from my son &apos;s house .
when does a fort stop being a fort ?
hey . as long as it &apos;s still made out of blankets ...
right ?
these &apos;ll be perfect for the pierce &apos;s mom memorial tunnel .
so , this is a night school
but where is professor woolley &apos;class ?
how &apos; bout this one ?
no . that &apos;s professor huyck &apos;s class--
&quot; history of ... something . &quot;
you can &apos;t pronounce it ?
no . it literally says history of something .
let me see that .
&quot; principles of intermediate ?
&quot; studyology ? class 101 &quot; ?
look , this one just says learning
with an exclamation point .
hello , professor professorson .
or should i say ... woolley ?
what class are you teaching tonight , professor ?
math .
math ?
uh @-@ huh .
do you mind if we sit in ?
not at all . right this way .
so what kind of math do you teach , professor ?
well , you know , math .
uh ... numbers .
pi .
new math . uh ...
get him !
he went into that blanket fort !
i think he went this way !
do you see him ?
oh , sorry .
troy ! abed !
hey , guys .
welcome to fluffy town .
no smoking , no farting , no pillow fighting .
we &apos;re in a chase !
that &apos;s allowed .
there he is !
follow us .
but afterwards ,
you should really check out our civil rights museum .
leonard , back up !
you shouldn &apos;t even be in here , leonard .
you already have three farting strikes against you .
w--he &apos;s getting away !
i know a shortcut . through the turkish district .
britta ?
go !
there he is ! what the hell &apos;s this ?
latvian independence parade .
don &apos;t look at me . they had the proper permits .
damn it ! we lost him !
luckily , i sent the diorama car to the chem lab
to have the explosive analyzed .
isn &apos;t that him playing the trejdeksnis ?
nice try , woolley !
now , tell us everything .
tell you ?
i &apos;ll show you !
what is this place ?
this , annie , is night school .
every student , every teacher , every class--
figments ...
puffs of hot air ...
from the lips of a ghost
in the shadow of a unicorn &apos;s dream .
i made it up . night school doesn &apos;t exist .
i used to be a student here at greendale like you , jeff ,
then one day i invented a fake course to get a free credit .
to keep up the lie , i had to create a fake teacher
who needed other fake classes
that needed to be filled with other fake students ,
and so on and so on and so on , &quot; etchethra ! &quot;
did you just mispronounce et cetera ?
my latin class is fake , jeff ...
like all my classes , like my life .
aren &apos;t you listening ?
yeah , i am .
and a very familiar feeling is starting to come over me .
i feel like someone is trying to teach me something .
jeff , the only thing
that &apos;s ever been learned in this room is regret !
would that this desk were a time desk ...
so that i could correct my past mistakes ...
ride dinosaurs ...
fight with jack the ripper .
oh , wait a minute . wait a minute .
unicorns ? ghost lips ? time desks ?
doesn &apos;t any of this overly stylized garbage
remind you of anyone ?
everything this guy says is ripped from
the sure @-@ to @-@ be @-@ unpublished pages of dean dangerous .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
oh , i think you do .
by the way , next time you walk someone to your fake lair ,
don &apos;t pass the theater department ...
drama professor sean garrity .
thank god . that character was killing me .
word of advice : if you ever scrape the dean &apos;s car ,
don &apos;t tell him you &apos;re gonna pay him back in acting .
on thanksgiving , i &apos;m supposed to crash his family dinner
and accuse him of stealing my girlfriend .
wow . i guess this did go all the way to the top .
i &apos;m calling the dean right now
and giving him a piece of my mind !
no , wait .
garrity ...
does the theater department have any of those prop guns
that fire blanks ?
of course . we just did a modern retelling of macbeth
set in gangland chicago .
oh . fresh take .
and you think i &apos;m lazy .
prop guns ?
jeff ... what do you have in mind ?
a little demonstration for the dean
on the dangers of trying to educate me .
he doesn &apos;t like fake classes ?
well , he &apos;s about to get a real lesson on the fact
that jeff winger never learns .
here he comes . get set .
you wanted to see me ?
hi , mr ... professorson .
his real name is woolley .
and he &apos;s defrauded your school
to a tune of dozens of credits per year
and nearly twice as many dollars .
well , that &apos;s serious .
fortunately for you ,
i &apos;m a big believer in second chances .
i &apos;m not .
hey ! annie !
oh , my god , you-- you shot him !
of course i shot him ! he was being dishonest .
and if there &apos;s one thing greendale &apos;s taught me , it &apos;s--
whoa , what the hell ?
she had a gun !
it was a fake gun !
we staged this to get back at you for deceiving us !
but you &apos;re the deceiver , jeffrey !
yeah ? well , now you &apos;re the dead guy .
jeff ! what are you doing ?
why do you have a real gun ?
why did you shoot the dean ?
well , he shot you !
not really !
he and i were in on this from the start .
when he found out you were faking a class ,
he came to me and we cooked up this whole conspiracy thing
to illustrate the slippery slope of academic fraud !
you know what you actually illustrated , annie ?
how to be a crappy friend .
once it was obvious the dean
had orchestrated everything ,
it was even more obvious
the dean was too stupid to orchestrate anything .
so on a hunch , i called him ,
and we hatched a plan to teach you
a lesson or two about friendship .
but , jeff , i only did it because i love you .
well , when you love someone ,
you have to take them as they are .
people aren &apos;t playthings , annie .
no , they are not .
look who &apos;s talking .
after everything you &apos;ve put me through ?
okay . where &apos;d you get that gun ?
there were only three prop guns .
yeah , well , i live in a terrible neighborhood .
annie , put the gun down .
after we kissed ,
i waited all summer to see you .
you ... buried me
like a shameful secret .
what &apos;s the matter , jeff ?
afraid crazy annie would go crazy for you ?
well , guess what .
annie &apos;s got a gun .
annie , just put the gun--
annie ... what have you done ?
if you love jeff winger so much ,
why did you conspire with me against him ?
i don &apos;t know !
i can &apos;t keep track of any of it anymore !
i just keep teaming up with whoever suggests it !
glad to hear you admit it .
when i called you to ask you to double @-@ cross annie ,
you didn &apos;t hesitate for a second .
do you even understand what a conspiracy is ?
if you conspire with every person that approaches you ,
you &apos;re not even really conspiring with anyone .
you &apos;re just doing random crap .
i know , i--
i &apos;m sorry ! i just--
i just wanna have fun with you guys and ...
i go crazy cooped up in my little office , and ...
time travel is really hard to write about !
if i &apos;m keeping track right , we should be done .
i &apos;ll just take these back to the theater department .
police !
drop your weapons !
down on the ground !
don &apos;t shoot , officer !
don &apos;t shoot , please . they &apos;re fake--
those are prop guns !
i guess it just goes to show you ...
prop guns belong backstage .
and ... scene .
you have got to be kidding me !
professor garrity called and told me
what all of you were up to .
made me mad . guns aren &apos;t toys .
in 100 % of all fake gun related shootings ,
the victim is always the one with the fake gun .
hey , sean , you got breakfast plans ?
i do now .
so , sean ...
we &apos;re still on for thanksgiving , right ?
just talk to your father , craig .
would that this hoodie were a time hoodie .
hey , dean ,
how &apos; bout that credit ?
no !
damn it .
i &apos;m not sure what lessons
either of us managed to teach each other ,
but i am proud of annie .
she took to deception
like abed took to cougar town .
it &apos;s really good .
especially when she went off script .
you said to be convincing .
check it out , bros .
you made the front page !
毯堡风尚席卷全国
you know what this means .
we &apos;ve gone mainstream .
initiate protocol omega .
we &apos;ve started looting !
wanna build a cardboard submarine ?
get out of my brain .
once ...
upon ...
a ...
time ...
there ...
was ...
a ...
big ...
spaceship .
and ...
aliens .
and ...
mercenaries .
and ?
war .
and ?
betrayal .
and ?
romance ?
and ?
karate .
and ?
credits .
the
end .
we should write a screenplay together .
