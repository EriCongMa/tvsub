the wrath of god himself !
just wait , man !
i finally got him down .

uh , the ibuprofen must have kicked in .
ah , it &apos;s that preschool .
place is like a petri dish .
i thought you had a few days off .
what &apos;s the case ?
it &apos;s about some missing kids .
i guess you gotta go in , then , huh ?
please don &apos;t walk away like that .
we &apos;ve talked about this .
i know this is hard on you .
henry , too .
on all of us . look , if i had someone to cover my shifts , i would .
what if it was henry ?
don &apos;t .
it &apos;s not henry . henry &apos;s right in there .
what if it was ?
you &apos;d want someone out there looking for him .
no , i know . you &apos;re right . it &apos;s just ...
things worked better when you were at the pentagon .
i wasn &apos;t helping anyone there , will .
you worked normal hours and weekends off .
fine . i &apos;ll tell them i can &apos;t come in .
don &apos;t do that .
i was supposed to have time off . henry &apos;s not feeling well .
it &apos;s all right . you should go .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
really , i got this .
i &apos;ll see you when you get back .
you don &apos;t have to be here .
ah , i get antsy when i &apos;m gone too long .
and thanks for the team &apos;s donation to als in carolyn &apos;s name .
she would have appreciated it .
so how are you doing ?
i &apos;m ok .
it &apos;s funny , though .
we were divorced 20 years .
and i never missed her as much as i do right now .
hey , you .
welcome back .
good to be back , penelope .
we &apos;re ready when you are , sir .
the bodies of two unidentified boys
were found near wichita , kansas , a week apart .
both were caucasian and between the ages of 15 and 17 .
they were each found mangled in the aftermath of a tornado .
yeah , but that &apos;s not what did them in .
the m.e. has determined
that the cause of death was blunt force trauma
to the head before the storms hit .
well , the death blow in each case
was in almost exactly the same spot .
now , what about all the other damage to their bodies ?
some of their limbs are missing .
yeah , victim number one , his right leg was taken off .
victim number 2 , both arms were severed .
but was that because of the tornado or the unsub ?
the m.e. still hasn &apos;t discovered that . he &apos;s a busy guy .
major storms have hit the area . 23 dead . the morgue is slammed .
it fits the unsub . he &apos;s got a hell of a sadistic streak .
well , a tornado would clear the air
and give the unsub the privacy to do his thing .
he may be using the storm as the body disposition modality .
forensic countermeasure , wind , hail , rain ,
mother nature destroys the crime scene .
or he wants us to think
mother nature actually committed the murders .
what concerns me is the brief period between kills .
only a week . he &apos;s moving fast .
we need to move faster . garcia , tet me i.d.s on all the victims .
i &apos;m a gale @-@ force wind .
wheels up in 30 .
oh , and pack for foul weather .
the forecast is nasty .
the national weather service has issued a tornado warning
for sedgwick county , kansas , at 9 p.m. meteorologists ...
yeah , we &apos;re back ! told you !
you owe me 5 bucks .
better pay up this time .
&quot; for the man sound of body and serene of mind ,
&quot; there is no such thing as bad weather .
&quot; every day has its beauty .
&quot; and storms which whip the blood
do but make it pulse more vigorously . &quot;
george gissing .
central plains .
right in the middle of tornado alley .
if this unsub is using tornadoes as a forensic countermeasure ,
then kansas certainly is the ideal setting .
tornadoes do pose a significant threat .
during this year &apos;s super outbreak back in april ,
there were 336 confirmed tornadoes in just several days ,
resulting in over 300 lives lost .
hey . tell us something good , mama .
ok , so local p.d. have i.d. &apos; d your victims .
i &apos;m putting this all on
your tablets if you &apos;d like to follow along .
first up is jason meredith , 16 @-@ year @-@ old runaway
from garden city , kansas . mom said he took off over a year ago .
next up is eric janelle , 15 @-@ year @-@ old foster kid from wichita .
he &apos;s been gone 3 weeks .
oh , both of these kids have records
for possession and prostitution .
they were street hustlers .
at @-@ risk kids . this could be a sexual predator .
an extremely violent one if the unsub is responsible
for the damage done to the bodies ,
especially those missing limbs .
well , now , he could be
keeping the body parts for some sort of fetish .
oh , ok , eew . that is my cue .
i &apos;m here if you need me with my binary machines
that don &apos;t say gross things .
i didn &apos;t know you were a bad flyer .
i &apos;m not . i just hate turbulence .
you know , turbulence very rarely causes planes to crash .
that does me absolutely no good at the moment . thank you .
what we really need to worry about are microbursts ,
sudden downbursts of air associated with thunderstorms .
but a small craft like this , if we hit one of those
at the wrong altitude-- pulverized .
i beg of you to make him stop .
a tornado outside wichita killed 2 and injured 9 last night .
the twister , which classified as an f2 on the fujita scale ,
is the latest in a freak series of storms
to hit late in the season .
more harsh weather is expected
as officials prepare for the worst .
the guy was torn up pretty bad .
thought we &apos;d find his arms , but we never did .
found him right over there .
well , the unsub definitely has his own mode of transportation .
this is way off the beaten path .
and the first victim , jason meredith ,
was found over 30 miles away .
you say you were able to clear this place before the storm hit ?
i didn &apos;t know you could do that for tornadoes .
when we get enough lead time ,
we try to clear all the mobile home parks .
the last place you want to be in a twister is in a trailer .
we close off the main roads , too .
ok , so the unsub either found a way in
or he was already here and he hid during the evacuation .
that , or the body got sucked up into the funnel cloud
and was thrown here from someplace else .
either way , he came into close contact with this storm .
maybe even close enough to put himself in danger .
or he waited someplace safe for it to pass
and came back and dumped the body .
no , i think the storm
itself actually means something to this guy .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s just using it to cover his tracks ?
i played ball in college with a guy from indiana .
he said he and his boys used to get drunk and then chase storms .
said it was the closest they could get to the true power of god .
i saw an f3 when i was in high school . he wasn &apos;t kidding .
ok , so he &apos;s impulsive , probably young ,
maybe a loner with nothing to lose .
we should be looking at actual storm @-@ chasers .
where can we find them ?
they mostly work with the university .
you think this guy &apos;s educated .
well , he knows enough
about the weather to use it to his advantage .
so far it &apos;s working .
here you go .
when was the last time you saw jason ?
the day he ran away .
a little over a year ago .
he came and he hugged me just like he always did
before he went to school .
do you know why he would leave home ?
his father , ray .
he used to beat on me .
on jason , too .
and how did jason cope with that ?
he &apos;d always try to protect me .
even when he was a little guy ,
he always really fought back .
sometimes if , afterwards , if i was crying ,
he &apos;d just come and he &apos;d sit there and hold my hand .
so it sounds like you and eric were pretty good friends .
those other kids ain &apos;t too cool at that house .
your foster mom said that you used to get in a lot of fights
before eric got there .
that &apos;s my boy .
nobody messes with me
&apos;cause nobody messes with him .
so he looks out for you .
yeah , we look out for each other .
when was the last time you saw him ?
about 3 weeks ago .
he said he was running to the store
and never came back .
he in some kind of trouble or something ?
we found him a couple of days ago .
he took the news about eric pretty well .
tough kid .
i guess they have to be . they &apos;re all alone .
each of the victims had a strong protective instinct
and was looking out for somebody else besides themselves .
maybe the unsub is keying in on that .
boys like that are hard to fool .
what if he used to be one of them ?
i mean , those kids would see
right through someone trying to be a poseur .
if his m.o. is connected to the weather ,
he &apos;s gonna try to grab another boy soon .
there &apos;s a major system expected tonight .
what &apos;s up , guys ?
where can i get some beers ?
quickie mart . take a right on main .
sorry , man . i &apos;m not from around here . where &apos;s main ?
about 4 blocks that way .
thanks .
hey , uh , any of you guys want to party ?
got some tuss . a little weed , too .
how about you ?
come here , buddy boy . it &apos;s all good .
he &apos;s too young .
it &apos;s 100 .
i got 50 .
and i &apos;ll thrown in a couple of sixers for you and your boys .
heh heh . come on , man .
let &apos;s get in . let &apos;s go have some fun .
every slab in the house is full .
could you hold that ?
we have two weeks over .
can &apos;t apologize enough for the delay .
4 years of med school , most of the time it &apos;s old folks ,
heart attacks , and strokes .
now , i &apos;m from new york .
not a whole lot of action out here in wichita .
your guys are right here .
identical blows to the head .
well , that &apos;s what tipped me off ,
not to mention they &apos;re both john does .
kids this age get claimed fast .
they had alcohol and dextromethorphan in their systems ?
cough medicine .
yeah . you see it with a lot of kids .
it &apos;s a cheap high , free if you can steal it .
and these two had a whole lot of it on board .
what were you able to
determine from all the damage to the bodies ?
well , it &apos;s mostly consistent
with tornado casualties i &apos;ve seen before .
lacerations , abrasions , massive internal trauma .
mostly ?
well , their limbs . those are chopped off .
i &apos;m guessing with an axe or a cleaver .
yeah , a dull one by the looks of the tissue damage
at the stumps .
cut off postmortem .
oh , definitely , but only minutes after they were killed .
you see the discoloration ?
the decomposition begins
almost as soon as the blood supply stops .
they both have ligature marks on their wrists and ankles ,
at least what they have left of them .
good eye . those are all actually antemortem .
they &apos;re from restraints .
he held them before the kill .
was there any sign of sexual assault ?
inconclusive . all the damage made it impossible to tell .
so , he gets them drunk and high ,
he restrains them , kills them ,
a cleaves off a limb as a souvenir .
then he dumps the body and lets the storm clean up his mess .
but why the souvenir ?
what or who , exactly , is he trying to remember ?
the national weather service has issued a tornado warning
for butler county , kansas .
a large , violent storm moving west at 40 miles per hour .
ok , time to go .
... this large and destructive tornado .
take cover immediately .
this is an extremely dangerous and life @-@ threatening situation .
come on , let &apos;s go !
knock it off !
we gotta go !
don &apos;t worry , buddy boy .
i &apos;d never forget you .
double or nothing i find us another one ?
what , you scared to lose again ?
all right , then , gentleman &apos;s bet .
that &apos;s my boy .
never seen anything like it .
name &apos;s gary dyson .
16 . runaway from kansas city .
a couple of my guys have seen him before .
i.d. &apos; d him off the tattoos on what &apos;s left of his arms .
this particular area get hit with a tornado last night ?
thunderstorms came through .
warnings went out , but no twisters .
the weather &apos;s gotta be the trigger .
he &apos;s following the patterns .
we track the storms , we find the unsub .
forensic evidence has been washed away .
but behaviorally , it &apos;s the most intact crime scene
we &apos;ve encountered so far .
it &apos;s the same blow to the head , but no cuts , no abrasions .
except he &apos;s missing his torso .
it was only a matter of time before he missed one .
tornadoes are extremely unpredictable and sometimes
last only a matter of minutes before they dissipate .
the fact that he was able to leave his previous victims
directly in the path of one is astounding .
so the conditions were perfect last night ,
but his tornado never came .
it &apos;s only been 4 days . he &apos;s accelerating .
and the weather &apos;s driving him to do it .
guys , we know that fetishists
are loyal to the body parts they take ,
but i think that this unsub is loyal to the whole of these parts .
if you were to take the
missing pieces from all the victims so far ,
you could almost assemble an entire body .
so he &apos;s not taking bodies apart ,
he &apos;s putting one together .
we &apos;re looking for a white male in his mid- to late @-@ 20s .
he &apos;s mobile and he travels great distances to follow storms .
he &apos;s probably in a truck or a van .
we believe he may live in that vehicle .
it &apos;s probably beat up ,
maybe rusted from the elements .
sorry .
jeffrey dahmer , serial killer ,
was under the delusion
they he could create young male sex zombies
that wouldn &apos;t resist his advances .
and when dahmer &apos;s test subjects died ,
he kept their body parts as souvenirs .
skulls , hearts , even genitalia .
restoring body parts is no small task .
they &apos;re gonna get ripe fast .
he needs lots of ice , salt , maybe , something to preserve them .
and he &apos;s paying for all that stuff somehow . gas , too .
he doesn &apos;t have the social skills to hold a job for long ,
so he &apos;s most likely a day laborer , handyman ,
anything transitory .
we think he &apos;s using the weather
as a forensic countermeasure to destroy evidence ,
but we also think he might be some sort of symphoraphiliac .
sorry , symphora what ?
uh , excuse me .
symphoraphiliacs-- they &apos;re sexually aroused
by disaster .
usually fires or traffic accidents .
in this case , the weather must enhance his excitement .
he hunts street kids , so he may be from a similar background .
and he &apos;s most likely uneducated ,
but he &apos;s still charming enough to engage his victims .
we &apos;ll talk to the press . you should warn any transient kids
you might know . as this weather gets worse ,
so will the unsub .
all right . let &apos;s get to it .
since when is a seizure fine ?
the doctor said it &apos;s normal for kids his age .
but his fever broke .
yeah .
it &apos;s back again .
did you give him his medicine this morning ?
no . he was ok .
did he feel warm ?
well , you checked , right ?
jj , of course i did .
what are you trying to say ?
nothing . i--
where is he now ?
he &apos;s resting . i &apos;m just waiting for some paperwork
and then we &apos;re gonna go home .
ok . i &apos;ll call you when my flight arrives .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
henry &apos;s sick .
i &apos;m coming home .
call you later .
what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , it &apos;s henry .
he had a febrile seizure .
will took him to the e.r.
he--he &apos;s fine .
apparently it &apos;s totally normal .
look , i gotta get back home .
of course . anything i can do ?
can i borrow the jet ?
i think the budget oversight committee
might not appreciate my generosity .
yeah , well , worth a shot , right ?
check in and let us know everything &apos;s all right .
ok .
hey , hotch . i &apos;ve been thinking--
the vast majority of unsubs with this type of m.o.
aren &apos;t driven by the killing .
they &apos;re really fascinated by the body parts .
psychologically they exist
in a realm where fantasy meets delusion .
it &apos;s basically the perfect
blueprint for the creation of a serial killer--
yes . i &apos;m rambling , aren &apos;t i ?
yes .
should probably get to the point .
i think i know how this unsub may have gotten started .
all right , the first victim was found missing his right leg ,
the second , both arms , and the third had no torso .
so that leaves the left leg and the head unaccounted for .
we can assume the head would be the most difficult piece to find .
that part would have to fit an unsub &apos;s fantasy perfectly .
so he &apos;d most likely save it for last .
now , what that tells us is there &apos;s a victim out there
we haven &apos;t found yet who &apos;s missing his left leg .
or the unsub hasn &apos;t acquired it yet .
true , but most body part collectors evolve to this level ,
and in many cases they exhumes bodies for parts
before they start killing .
all right , let me call garcia .
so you think our unsub did the same thing .
p.g. at your service , don &apos;t let the name fool you .
baby girl , you &apos;re on speaker .
garcia , can you look for grave robberies in tornado alley
over the last 5 years ?
okey @-@ dokey .
searching .
oh . that &apos;s a shockingly big list .
who knew grave @-@ robbing was so on trend ?
how many of those involve the bodies of teenage boys ?
uh ... none .
what about morgues and funeral homes ?
momentito ...
again , that is a list that should not be that big .
mostly stolen embalming fluid , though .
it &apos;s often used like pcp , garcia .
i &apos;m feeling optimistic about the youth of america .
there are no teenagers involved in this either .
all right , try looking for thefts involving body parts ,
specifically left legs .
ok , eew ! see , this is why
i can &apos;t talk about how my day was at dinner .
breakfast , lunch .
spencer , you scare me .
join the club .
a left leg was stolen off a body a year ago
at the riggio funeral home in tulsa .
they never found who did it .
garcia , what was the weather like in the area at the time ?
uh , thunderstorms and tornadoes .
an f2 cyclone hit right around there ,
and then the robbery took place after they evacuated .
it &apos;s gotta be our unsub .
wait , there &apos;s more . the guy whose leg was stolen ,
he was a 47 @-@ year @-@ old father of 2 who died of leukemia .
that &apos;s a huge jump .
preferential child sex offenders don &apos;t usually
stray from their preferred age range .
it &apos;s not about the sex at all . he used the body
from the funeral home to develop his m.o.
so he could live out his fantasy and kill in a storm .
it still doesn &apos;t explain what or who he &apos;s building .
whatever it is , this unsub won &apos;t stop
until he finds a perfect head .
that &apos;s the final piece to his puzzle .
hey ! what &apos;s up , guys ?
do you need a ride or something ?
uh , no , man , we &apos;re good . thanks .
you sure ? it &apos;s kind of wet out here .
yeah , yeah , we &apos;re good .
come on , man . it &apos;s raining buckets .
hey . get off me .
hey , man , it &apos;s cool . it &apos;s cool .
come on .
hey ! fellas , i was wondering ,
can you tell me the best way to get to i @-@ 135 ?
yeah , it &apos;s back that way .
thanks .
appreciate it .
i &apos;m from oklahoma .
i don &apos;t get up here much .
so there &apos;s nothing ?
um , ok , what about out of kansas city ?
no . no .
um ... ok , thanks .
hey . thought you were out of here .
ohh . flights are canceled &apos; cause of the weather .
how &apos;s henry ?
he &apos;s headed home . finally released him .
that &apos;s great news .
where are you guys off to ?
to the university to talk to some storm chasers .
stay dry .
yeah , right .
who &apos;s that with hotch ?
there &apos;s been another abduction .
a boy named shaun rutledge . that &apos;s his younger brother billy .
he says a young white guy in an rv
attacked him with a crowbar in the rain .
he &apos;s also changed his victim selection criteria .
the boy he grabbed gets straights as ,
plays football , even volunteers at his church .
so he wanted him so badly , he was willing to leave a witness ?
which suggests he &apos;s losing touch with reality
and his delusions are starting to take over .
what is it about this kid that was so attractive to him ?
he was teenage and caucasian like the others , right ?
we also think that a sexual element may actually not be at play .
so then what the hell is driving this guy ?
maybe it &apos;s love .
what if he &apos;s trying to recreate someone he loves ?
it is an emotion that drives us to extremes .
if he &apos;s trying to recreate someone ,
it &apos;s probably somebody he loved and lost .
wait . you said he was with his big brother , right ?
holla at your girl .
baby girl , i need those great big beautiful brains of yours .
jazz hands ready . gimme .
ok , look at all the teenage male victims or tornadoes
in the last 10 years . same geography as before .
that would be male , 13 to 18--42 .
how many victims had younger brothers that survived ?
uh ... 10 .
the unsub might have been a high @-@ risk kid .
garcia , how many of the survivors have criminal records ?
i got two for you .
first up is 27 @-@ year @-@ old justin harris ,
had a dui in 2008 .
next is 22 @-@ year @-@ old travis james .
ooh , little troublemaker .
shoplifting , possession , and prostitution . oh , my .
and all when he was a minor .
you got a home address or a vehicle registered in his name ?
uh @-@ uh . none .
you got a photo on this guy ?
it &apos;s on your tablet right now .
all right , this is a composite sketch
from the description the kid gave .
i don &apos;t know why you put up such a fight .
we &apos;re gonna be brothers , man .
me and you , against the world .
old school .
there . there .
oh , my god . this poor kid .
in 2001 , travis james lost his big brother tucker
and his mom jan when a tornado hit the mccleary trailer park .
in enid , oklahoma .
that &apos;s just south of here .
so our guy &apos;s a local .
everybody just sit tight .
oh , that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s gonna kick in .
hang on , garcia . the power just went out .
garcia , i think we &apos;re good . keep going .
sometime before this evil tornado touched down ,
travis , along with 5 other boys ,
testified against a one roscoe gulch .
for what ?
it appears that this gulch character
was a notorious pedophile in the area ,
and he was a resident of the
same trailer park as travis and his family .
i &apos;m looking at police reports now .
it looks like brother tucker had confronted
this gulch person lots of times .
he even broke the creep &apos;s nose once .
he was protecting his little brother .
ohh . and then the plot thickens .
according to a statement from travis ,
right after gulch was acquitted ,
he and his brother went to gulch &apos;s mobile home .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
a fight ensued .
travis said it was like his big brother went crazy .
he was upset about the acquittal
and dealt some justice of his own .
travis said he heard tornado sirens .
it &apos;s a tornado ! get out of here !
tucker , look out !
he then ran to a drainage pipe nearby .
after that , tucker and gulch somehow got trapped
in the mobile home when the twister hit .
travis said he saw the mobile home
get swallowed up by the tornado .
and when he came out there was nothing left .
garcia , how old was tucker when he was killed ?
17 .
he was found in pieces .
it took his dna and dental records to i.d. him .
travis went into foster care and he was reported missing in 2003 .
he ran away .
10 years ago his brother got ripped apart ,
and now he &apos;s trying to put him back together ?
but why start killing now ?
garcia , send me current weather reports for the area ,
including radar images if you have them .
ask and you shall receive . it is on your tablets .
with the weather in the area ,
he &apos;s going to be so excited , he won &apos;t wait .
he &apos;ll take the boy to the closest area with the most activity .
that &apos;s right around here , just southeast of us .
it &apos;s frankenstein .
创造了一个怪物
what ?
the unsub isn &apos;t just trying to put his brother back together ,
he &apos;s trying to bring him back from the dead .
he believes that tornadoes have the power to take life ,
so conversely , they should have the power to restore it .
we &apos;ll pick up rossi and prentiss on the way . let &apos;s go .
uhh ! damn it !
damn . i need a beer .
you want one ?
ahh , nothing like a cold one to take the edge off , right ?
you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
it might make you feel better .
garcia , what have you got ?
sir , i found your trigger . a year ago ,
a tornado ripped through a cemetery near tulsa .
one of the 53 graves that was disturbed
one of that was tucker james .
his brother was killed by a storm ,
then his memorial was destroyed by one .
now he &apos;s using both to build a memorial of his own .
now that he has that boy &apos;s head ,
the delusion will completely to take over .
garcia , those storm chasers at the university we talked to ,
they should be out in full force .
i &apos;m sending you their number now .
tell them to be on the lookout for the unsub &apos;s rv .
and , garcia , patch into their radio chatter .
they &apos;ll know where the storms are .
on it , my pretties .
come on , get it together .
we &apos;re gonna have fun , bro .
like before .
remember that time we stole mama &apos;s bourbon ?
rode our bikes , what ,
10 miles to go see them girls ?
god , what were their names ?
you thought you were gonna get laid .
and that chick . puked herself so bad ,
i thought i &apos;d die .
do you remember that ?
hey . it &apos;s gonna be all right .
we &apos;re gonna do this thing tonight .
why do you keep fighting , you dumb son of a bitch ? !
you know what ?
here , i &apos;ll show you .
the national weather service has issued a tornado warning
for sedgwick county in kansas at 9 p.m. central daylight time ...
ok , man ! here we go !
what &apos;d i tell you ?
we need to head into those areas with the most precipitation .
so make a right at the next intersection .
it should be pawnee road .
hey , how exactly are we supposed to chase this storm ?
the unsub won &apos;t actually chase the storm .
to get close to it , you have to get in front of it .
it &apos;s a little like playing chicken .
what ?
it &apos;s frozen .
hey , hotch .
we just lost the internet .
i &apos;m frozen up , too .
the weather must be affecting the upload .
i &apos;m patching garcia in .
yes , boss .
garcia , we just lost our internet
and we need you to guide us into the storm .
consider me your eyes and ears , sir .
yeah , it &apos;s beauty . it looks like a landspout .
great funnel on that one . she &apos;s heading north .
ok , guys , a twister has been spotted near rose hill
just south of your position .
the storm @-@ chaser dudes are calling it a landspout .
we don &apos;t want that one .
landspout tornados are relatively insignificant .
where to , then ?
garcia , look for hook echoes on your monitor .
hey , hook echoes . yeah .
ok , i &apos;m gonna do that . just tell me what they are .
they &apos;re swirling hook @-@ like radar signatures
that look surprisingly like what you &apos;d expect them to .

&quot; bedtime for baby star . &quot;
once there was a baby star ,
he lived up near the sun .
and every night at bedtime ,
that baby star wanted to have some fun .
he would shine and shine and fall and shoot
and twinkle , oh , so bright ,
and he said , &quot; mommy , i &apos;ll run away
if you make me say good night . &quot;
and then his mommy kissed him on his sparkly nose and said ...
&quot; no matter where you go ,
&quot; no matter where you are ,
&quot; no matter how big you grow ,
&quot; and even if you stray far ...
&quot; i &apos;ll love you forever ,
&apos;cause you &apos;ll always be my baby star . &quot;
good night , mommy .
