how much time do we have ?
uh , t @-@ minus five hours , 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower .
okay , our position is 34.48 degrees north , 118.31 west .
that means the azimuth should be ...
168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93 .
anything yet ?
uh , we have a signal , but there &apos;s no frame lock .
hang on . how about ... now ?
we did it .
we have the west coast feed of hbo .
ooh , real sex .
big deal . every time i watch that show ,
it &apos;s old women putting condoms on cucumbers .
all right , let &apos;s see what &apos;s on the east coast feed .
oh , hey . dune .
not a great movie , but look at that beautiful desert .
too bad sheldon couldn &apos;t come with us .
yeah , it &apos;s just not the same without him .
oh , this sucks . i &apos;m switching back to real sex .
sheldon &apos;s log .
stardate 63345.3 .
while my colleagues are off observing the leonid meteor shower ,
i have remained behind to complete my paper
on the decays of highly excited massive string states .
although my research is going well ,
i do miss the warmth of human companionship .
and good evening to you , siam palace .
this is sheldon cooper .
yeah , i &apos;m going to be dining alone this evening ,
so i &apos;ll be reducing my usual order .
i &apos;d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate
and , uh , one half of the golden treasure for two .
oh , for heaven &apos;s sake . in the mid @-@ 18th century ,
king rama iv of siam divided a huge empire
amongst the colonial powers of europe in order to preserve his throne .
surely , you , his cultural descendant ,
can handle pad thai and dumplings .
sheldon , help !
i need to go-- but you keep in mind
that my sharply worded comments
on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store .
penny . penny . penny .
come in ! hurry !
penny ?
i &apos;m back here .
penny . penny . penny .
oh , for god &apos;s sakes , i &apos;m in the bathroom !
shall i come back at a better time ?
get in here !
hurry !
don &apos;t you dare knock !
hello .
i slipped in the shower , and i think i dislocated my shoulder .
not surprising .
you have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow
for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction .
what ?
tubs are slippery .
i know . i slipped .
i have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub .
yeah , okay , whatever . will you just turn the water off and help me up ?
they &apos;re holding umbrellas .
what ?
the ducks in my tub .
they &apos;re whimsical because ducks have neither a need for ,
nor the ability to use , umbrellas .
oh , my god . i got to go to the emergency room .
well , assuming you &apos;re correct that your right humerus
is no longer seated in the glenoid socket ,
i would certainly think so .
okay , can you drive me ?
i don &apos;t drive .
well , i can &apos;t drive !
well , it seems we &apos;ve reached an impasse .
i could call you a cab or an ambulance .
no , no , no . i can &apos;t wait that long .
you got to help me , please .
all right . let it never be said that sheldon lee cooper
ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress .
no one &apos;s saying that . let &apos;s go .
well , it does seem rather ironic
that for want of 99 @-@ cent adhesive ducks ,
we both might die in a fiery car crash .
i wish penny didn &apos;t have to work . she loves camping .
yeah , that would have been great .
you and penny having sex in the tent
while i sit out here and watch howard hump a cactus .
okay , the best i can tell ,
there are eight other campsites nearby .
mostly science nerds like us ,
but just over yon ridge are two
not unattractive middle school teachers
who reek of desperation .
wow . wonderful .
how old are they ?
i don &apos;t know .
50 , 55 .
oh , menopause .
nature &apos;s birth control .
come on .
you guys can &apos;t be that hard up .
i am .
yeah , me , too .
look-- they gave me homemade cookies .
of course , they did . that &apos;s what grandmothers do .
so , what are we waiting for ?
relax .
i said we &apos;d stop by a little later after they have their nap .
good idea .
they &apos;ll be refreshed .
cookie ?
yeah . thank you .
not bad .
yeah , very tasty .
well , so tell me more about these teachers .
not much to tell .
they had a vw microbus
and were wearing tie @-@ dyed grateful dead t @-@ shirts .
good cookies .
i see no organizational system in here whatsoever .
which panties do you wear on mondays ?
i don &apos;t need panties .
i just need shorts and a shirt .
my mother always told me
one should wear clean underpants
in case one is in an accident .
one was already in an accident .
that doesn &apos;t mean one won &apos;t be in another ,
especially if i &apos;m driving .
clothes , sheldon .
i need clothes !
okay .
here .
seriously ? those shorts with that top ?
all right .
no .
no .
oh , that &apos;s cute .
we should have you checked for a concussion .
okay .
now , you got to help me put these on .
all right .
but don &apos;t look .
don &apos;t look ?
i don &apos;t want you to see me naked .
oh .
well , that &apos;s understandable .
you may be interested to know
that a prohibition against looking
is well established in heroic mythology .
uh , lot and his wife , perseus and medusa ,
orpheus and eurydice ...
yeah , great .
they always look .
it never ends well .
okay . now you got help me get my arm into the sleeve .
okay .
is that my arm ?
it doesn &apos;t feel like an arm .
then , maybe you should let it go .
all righty .
stars are pretty , aren &apos;t they ?
up above the world so high .
like little diamonds in the sky .
that &apos;s beautiful , dude .
you should ... you should write that down before someone steals it .
so , when do the meteors get here ?
the meteors don &apos;t get here .
the earth is moving into their path .
i can feel it .
i can feel the earth moving .
it &apos;s moving too fast .
raj , slow it down .
okay , how &apos;s that ?
better . thanks .
stars are pretty , aren &apos;t they ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
it &apos;s your american accent . everything you say sounds stupid .
&quot; stars are pretty , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
for the record , i should let you know
this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle .
you have your learner &apos;s permit , right ?
yes , and i have logged
a considerable number of hours on a simulator .
good .
didn &apos;t work out well .
all right , can we please go ?
one moment .
according to my driver &apos;s ed book , the side mirror is properly adjusted
when the driver &apos;s door handle is visible in the lower right corner .
there &apos;s the handle .
oh , no , too far .
bringing it back .
optimized .
now , where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror ?
it &apos;s right there .
where is the passenger side mirror ?
in a parking lot in hollywood .
now , can we please go ?
yes .
as soon as i adjust my seat .
oh , dear . i &apos;m going to have to start again .
if i could speak the language of rabbits ,
that will be amazed , i will be their king .
i hate my name .
it has &quot; nerd &quot; in it .
len @-@ nerd .
i lost my virginity to my cousin jeanie .
i would be kind to my rabbit subjects .
at first .
you know what &apos;s a cool name ?
angelo .
that has angel and jell @-@ o in it .
it was my uncle murray &apos;s funeral .
we were all back at my aunt barbara &apos;s house .
our eyes locked over the pickled herring .
we never meant for it to happen .
one day , i hold a great ball for the president of france ,
but the rabbits-- they hate me and don &apos;t come .
i am embarrassed , so i eat all the lettuce in the world
and make them watch .
people could call me angie .
( la sylvester stallone ) : yo , angie , how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
to this day , i can &apos;t look at pickled herring
without being aroused and ashamed .
oh ! cousin jeanie .
could you please drive a little faster ?
oh , i think we &apos;re going sufficiently fast .
what &apos;s that ?
nothing . the engine does that sometimes .
it can &apos;t be nothing .
the check engine light is on .
we need to find a service station .
no . the light has been on since i bought the car .
all the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes .
it &apos;s not going to explode .
just keep driving .
warp speed ahead , mr. spock .
mr. spock did not pilot the enterprise .
he was the science officer , and i guarantee you that
if he ever saw the enterprise &apos;s check engine light blinking ,
he would pull the ship over immediately .
oh , god , i &apos;m gonna lose the arm .
oh , well , red light . release accelerator
and slowly apply ... the ... brake .
nailed it .
while we have a moment , may i ask you a question ?
what ?
why do you have the chinese character for soup
tattooed on your right buttock ?
it &apos;s not soup .
it &apos;s courage .
no , it isn &apos;t .
but i suppose it does take courage
to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup .
how did you see it ?
you said you wouldn &apos;t look .
sorry . as i told you , the hero always peeks .
anything ?
no . that was the last pudding cup .
no !
what about slim jims ?
that &apos;s what he used to eat his pudding , remember ?
right . that was so good !
sweety and meaty at the same time .
wait . wait , wait . so you &apos;re saying
we &apos;re out of food ?
the only thing in here are blue ice packs .
i know they &apos;re poison ,
but they look like big , yummy otter pops .
oh , god , i am so hungry .
me , too .
check and see if we have any more pudding .
okay .
all right , there &apos;s no need to bark at me .
according to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk ,
you &apos;ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack ,
but appears to be well enough
to play doodle jump on his iphone .
we have to fill these out .
&quot; describe illness or injury . &quot;
i dislocated my shoulder .
all right .
and how did the accident occur ?
you already know that .
&quot; cause of accident . &quot;
&quot; lack of adhesive ducks . &quot;
okay , medical history .
&quot; have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes ? &quot;
no .
kidney disease ?
no .
migraines ?
getting one .
are you currently pregnant ?
no .
are you sure ? you look a bit puffy .
change migraine to yes .
&quot; when was your last menstrual period ? &quot;
oh . next question .
i &apos;ll put , &quot; in progress . &quot;
okay , moving to psychiatric disorders .
&quot; list all major behavioral diagnoses ,
&quot; e.g. depression , anxiety , etcetera . &quot;
oh , my god , what the hell does this
have to do with my stupid shoulder ? !
&quot; episodes of sub psychotic rage . &quot;
ass .
&quot; possible tourette &apos;s . &quot;
all right . &quot; moles , lesions or other skin conditions . &quot;
&quot; soup tattoo on right buttock . &quot;
hey , sheldon , sheldon , look ,
i am scared and in a lot of pain .
could you please take a break from being you for
just a minute and try being--
i don &apos;t know-- comforting ?
i &apos;m sorry .
there , there .
everything &apos;s going to be fine .
sheldon &apos;s here .
thanks . that &apos;s much better .
oh , i &apos;m so hungry !
will you shut up ?
we &apos;re all hungry .
okay , our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east .
easy target . big doughy scout master ,
couple of cubs , mostly webelos .
what kind of score we looking at ?
hot dogs , buns , s &apos;mores . i mean , it &apos;s a freaking 7 @-@ 11 .
all right , everyone grab flashlights .
oh , my god , could it be ?
yes !
my mother put an &quot; i love you &quot; brisket in my backpack .
quick , get forks .
you don &apos;t need forks .
it &apos;s so tender , it falls apart in your hands .
he &apos;s right .
i feel like we &apos;re forgetting something important .
me , too . but what ?
maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots ?
yes !
yes !
now remember , you were given powerful pain medication
and a muscle relaxer ,
so , uh , don &apos;t operate heavy machinery .
try not to choke on your own drool .
wait.you have to help me get into bed .
sheldon has to get me into bed .
bet you never thought i &apos;d say that .
yes .
the charm of your drug @-@ addled candor knows no bounds .
you know , people think you &apos;re this weird robot man
who &apos;s so annoying all the time , and you totally are .
but then it &apos;s like that movie wall @-@ e at the end .
you &apos;re so full of love ,
and you can save a plant
and get fat people out of the floaty chairs .
that &apos;s a fairly labored metaphor ,
but i appreciate the sentiment behind it .
sing &quot; soft kitty &quot; to me .
&quot; soft kitty &quot; is for when you &apos;re sick .
you &apos;re not sick .
injured and drugged is a kind of sick .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ...
wait , wait .
let &apos;s sing it as a round .
i &apos;ll start .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ...
so , that &apos;s where you come in .
i &apos;ll start over .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ...
i &apos;ve got all night , sheldon .
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ...
soft kitty , warm kitty , little ball of fur ...
happy kitty , sleepy kitty
happy kitty , sleepy kitty
purr , purr , purr
purr , purr , purr .
... and the next morning when he woke up ,
he rolled over and realized ...
... she was his cousin .
that &apos;s still not funny .
that &apos;s still not funny .
and she was my second cousin .
and she was my second cousin .
you &apos;re a real douche .
