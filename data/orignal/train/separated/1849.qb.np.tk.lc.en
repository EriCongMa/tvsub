we doctors take pride in the fact
that we can basically sleep standing up
anytime , anywhere .
jackson .
stop . stop !
hey , hey , jackson .
aah ! what ?
stop . stop . i &apos;m sorry , but you need to take something .
where &apos;s charles ? charles . where &apos;s charles ?
hey . hey . hey , stop .
it &apos;s lexie . wake up .
time for work ?
yeah , just about .
but it &apos;s a false pride , because the truth is ...
after about 20 hours without sleep ...
you might as well just come to work drunk ...
doctor or not .
so it &apos;s no wonder that fatal medical errors
increase at night ...
when we doctors are ...
proudly ...
sleeping on our feet .
recently ...
our communal pride has been shattered ,
and our egos have been wounded by new laws ...
hey .
that require that we sleep all day
before we work all night .
oh ! dr. shepherd .
there &apos;s french toast and coffee if you want breakfast .
it &apos;s 6.00 p.m.
right . um , bacon for your dinner ?
thank you , no .
we &apos;re not happy about it .
but as someone who may one day need medical care ...
you really should be .
it &apos;s &lt; i &gt; night of the living dead &lt; / i &gt; out there .
i &apos;m still sleeping .
a whole day happened while you were sleeping .
let &apos;s see . i did three aneurysm surgeries .
i consulted on a massive spinal tumor .
that was neat . got the phillips grant .
and oh , by the way ,
the , uh , soup of the day in the cafeteria
was potato leek soup .
you got the grant ?
yeah , i got the grant .
you got the alzheimer &apos;s grant ?
yeah , i got the alzheimer &apos;s grant .
mark is putting together a little celebration at joe &apos;s .
but i would much rather celebrate here with you .
i am late for work . gotta love the night shift .
proud of you .
thank you .
nice face .
well , at least i can do surgery . how &apos;s that hand ?
ah , it &apos;d be better if you hadn &apos;t run your face into it .
so he beats the hell out of you ,
and now you &apos;re laughing about it ?
ah , some of us can move on .
you &apos;re sitting on my coat .
and some of us can &apos;t .
did you just yawn ? was that a yawn ?
don &apos;t tell us that you &apos;re tired after
getting to sleep all day .
it &apos;s not as easy as it sounds .
not easy ? not e--
when i was a resident , i actually worked for a living .
i did every other night call for five years .
there were days that i didn &apos;t go home for 72 hours .
i loved it .
as you trudged through the snow ,
while you whittled your own scalpels .
sorry . i didn &apos;t quite catch that , karev .
uh , karev , i need you to follow up on my post @-@ ops .
and here . take this research .
divide out all the fistula cases .
avery and little grey , hunt is wag for you in the pit .
all right .
try not to screw up our patients .
good night and good luck .
gonna be over at the bar . try not to need us .
dr. grey ? shepherd &apos;s wife ?
you &apos;re with me tonight .
yes .
good . i heard you &apos;re good .
listen , i &apos;m late for dinner ,
so , um , i made a list of my patients , their protocols .
basically , everybody &apos;s stable . just try and keep &apos; em that way .
and if i need to get in touch with you , sir ?
you won &apos;t ...
&apos;cause you &apos;re good .
nice to meet you .
everybody else is stable . watch i.c.u. bed 12 .
he may need to be intubated ,
and call me if there are any major traumas .
avery .
how you feeling ?
what , my hand ? it &apos;s fine . just a little bruised .
no , i &apos;m not talking about your hand .
trauma demands a cool head .
if you &apos;re not up to this , then--
no , i &apos;m good .
thanks . karev and i are cool .
that &apos;s , uh , over ,
out of my system .
you don &apos;t have to prove anything here .
if you need a couple of shifts off--
i said i &apos;m good , sir .
all right .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m not asking you to talk to me .
i &apos;m telling you ...
talk to someone .
you got me ?
have a good night , sir .
hey , there you are .
there &apos;s the man of the hour . congratulations .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
first round is on me .
um , guys .

yeah . no , try again .
you need to tilt the glass like i said .

i &apos;m tilting it . okay , i know .
i know . i &apos;m telling you to tilt the glass .
just let me try again , okay ?
all right .
why are you behind the bar ?
uh , owen told me to get a job , so i &apos;m working .
what &apos;s everyone drinking ?
she sat on the sofa
for three days straight watching infomercials
and eating cereal out of the box , so yeah , yeah ,
i @-@ i told her to get a job .
but you didn &apos;t specify what kind .
well , i thought she &apos;d go to a lab or the morgue .
i didn &apos;t expect this .
well , tell her you changed your mind .
tell her she can be a housewife for all you care .
i think that
the only thing she &apos;d be worse at than bartending is housewifing .
what &apos;s so bad about bartending ? she &apos;s not dancing on a pole .
you know , i give this one night .
i mean , cristina yang of beverly hills--
she does not enjoy serving people .
all right ! i call this the early onset alzheimer &apos;s
because you won &apos;t remember anything after you drink it .
to shepherd and his genius brain crap .
to shepherd .
thank you .
oh , my god . this is strong .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna need a scotch .
yeah , make it two .
babies .
early onset alzheimer &apos;s--
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s a little distasteful ?
i think it &apos;s delicious .
cristina ...
you want a beer ?
no , no , i &apos;m on call . i want to talk .
you know , a bachelor party just came in .
uh , uh , we &apos;ll talk later .
all right !
yes . is someone getting married ? who &apos;s getting married ?
he said any major traumas .
we are not calling hunt .
we don &apos;t even know what this is yet .

reilly , you okay ?
lucas , it hurts .
it hurts really bad .
you &apos;ll be okay , ri , all right ?
we &apos;ll be okay .
what do we got ?
car versus train . 2 brothers , 17 and 15,
tried to outrun the coast starlight to portland .
the train won .
i know . it was stupid . it was so stupid .
i &apos;ll never do it again .
driver was inside the car . the other was thrown out .
no seat belt .
dr. avery , come take a look at this .
call hunt .
mrs. mcneil , i &apos;m dr. grey .
i &apos;ll be taking over for dr. stark tonight .
drew &apos;s in a lot of pain .
okay , well , that &apos;s not unusual for this type of chest surgery .
abdominal pain is not normal after pectus excavatum surgery ,
and it &apos;s been going on for two hours .
i &apos;m a nurse in seattle pres .
it &apos;s okay , drew , honey . mommy &apos;s right here .
his abdomen does seem a little tender .
i &apos;m concerned about his vitals .
and i know my son . he &apos;s not a complainer .
something is wrong . can you please call dr. stark ?
i will . i &apos;ll call him right away .
what , you &apos;re back already ?
that date wasn &apos;t even , like , what , an hour ?
i need a drink .
ooh , careful . ooh - you --
hey , hey ! that was mine . now you have
to order me another one .
oh , god . that &apos;s disgusting .
right . okay , so get this --
his very first question --
&quot; so what &apos;s your favorite food &quot; ?
what &apos;d you say ?
french , but that &apos;s not the point .
why would he ask me what my favorite food was ?
like he read that
that &apos;s some good icebreaker from some internet handbook
that was handed out at the loser fair ? ugh !
this is why you don &apos;t meet people on the internet .
you &apos;re married ! you don &apos;t get to have an opinion
about my pathetic forays into internet dating .
you do need a drink .
thank you .
go to africa .
what ?
arizona &apos;s an idiot .
and she &apos;s a fool , and you need to go there
and tell her that i told you to say
that dating ... is evil ,
and that what the two of you have is rare ,
and -- and that she &apos;s an idiot . get on an airplane
and go to africa , and thank god
that you never have to go on a first date again .
yeah , i &apos;m not going to africa .
well , then you &apos;re just as big an idiot as she is .
torres is a grown woman .
you can &apos;t make her do something she doesn &apos;t want to do .
okay , again , mr. perfect married guy ,
you don &apos;t get to open your mouth ,
&apos;cause wh
get ready . get ready .
one , two ...
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug ! oh , yeah ! oh , yeah !
who &apos;s first ? ! oh , whoo !
what the hell did i miss ?
joe , i need more beer !
you guys superglued yourselves together ... on purpose ?
apparently my son and girlfriend &apos;s love is so great ,
they can &apos;t hear you .
yes , they superglued their arms and hands together on purpose .
uh , why -- why would they --
we &apos;re moving to wisconsin tomorrow .
no , you &apos;re moving , dad .
i &apos;m staying here with lauren .
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re going to wisconsin
with me and your mom and the dog and the cat .
no , not without lauren .
i &apos;m not .
nobody can tear us apart , mr. nystrom .
i know that , lauren , but the doctor here
is still gonna give it a try .
i wish we could glue our lips together forever .
me , too .
i @-@ i will -- i will figure something out .
thank you .
have you ever had the tiramisu at gino &apos;s trattoria ?
excuse me ?
tiramisu , gino &apos;s trattoria ,
uh , ladyfingers soaked in rum ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
neither have i ,
because you felt the need to drag me away from my dinner
to examine a kid with gas .
gas ? i thought ...
oh , when i called you ,
he was in a lot of pain and his vitals were borderline .
they &apos;re better now
because i gave him a liter bolus
of iv fluids at 20 cc &apos;s per kilo .
but his pain --
yet what you should &apos;ve given him was an antiflatulent .
abdominal pain after chest wall surgery
in a patient on narcotic painkillers
is gas or constipation
until proven otherwise .
but , dr. stark , what if his pain is --
tiramisu .
avery , what do you have ?
large gaping wound to the abdomen .
looks like something sliced right through him .
debris inside . we need to get in there .
book an or .
right away .
reilly ? reilly , talk to me .
reilly can &apos;t talk right now , okay , buddy ?
he has got a tube in his throat to help him breathe .
reilly , i &apos;m right here , all right ?
put more pressure on that . lean in there .
pack it . pack it .
we were gonna be late , so i ran it .
funny , right ?
we didn &apos;t want to get in trouble with mom .
so i go back to school .
i &apos;m picking him up after band practice .
we &apos;re halfway home , he forgets his stupid saxophone .
200 .
clear .
he forgets everything !
300 .
everything !
everything !
clear .
continue compressions .
push one of epi and one of atropine .
i know it was stupid .
the guardrail had just come down
and i thought we could make it .
it &apos;s my fault . please .
please . he -- he &apos;s my little brother .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s little .
they &apos;re working on him , okay ?
i just need you to take it easy .
all right ? take it easy .
he &apos;s gonna be all right , right ?
time of death , 20 : 48
dr. hunt , we need to intubate him and get him to the or now .
another scotch ?
yeah .
on the house !
if every drink is on the house ,
then eventually , there &apos;ll be no house .
right . uh , $ 6 .
it &apos;s actually $ 8 .
you having fun ?
i am .
good . that &apos;s good .
keep it .
thank you .
hey , here she comes with our shots !
his pain is getting worse .
his color looks bad . his vitals haven &apos;t stabilized .
i &apos;ve seen gas , dr. grey . this isn &apos;t gas .
we have to give the medicine a little time to work .
we gave it time to work . it didn &apos;t work ...
which means this is not gas .
i &apos;ve worked the night shift . i know what goes on .
i &apos;ve lived through horror stories
of patients falling through the cracks
because residents are running around half asleep ,
and their attendings are nowhere to be found .
i will not let that happen to my son .
i won &apos;t either .
i promise . and i agree that it &apos;s not gas .
so let &apos;s run some tests and find out what &apos;s going on .
okay ?
thank you .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
okay , here you go , you guys .
to the groom !
to the groom !
it &apos;s rude to ditch out on your own party , you know ?
yang is bartending . do you know how disturbing that is ?
it &apos;s a phase . she &apos;s gonna be fine .
besides , you won one of the most prestigious grants out there .
this night &apos;s about you not yang .
... bad idea . that &apos;s a good idea .
suit yourself .
one , two , three .
groom !
groom !
how are we letting this happen ?
i mean , seriously , how are we just okay with it ?
oh , i &apos;m not okay . i &apos;m jealous .
cristina gets to live out the 20s we never got to
&apos;cause we were stuck in med school .
watch , ten years from now , we &apos;ll all have a midlife crisis
and end up doing the same thing .
except we &apos;ll be in our 40s and won &apos;t look as cute .
how many of those have you had ?
hey , my son is with his father .
i am 24 hours child @-@ free .
if christina yang can tend bar &apos; cause she wants to ,
then i can drink &apos; cause i want to .
has she mentioned me ?
what ?
i know she writes to you ,
so i &apos;m asking you if she &apos;s mentioned me .
well , you know , she &apos;s been very , um ...
she &apos;s , uh , she just sort of dove right into the medicine ,
and she &apos;s been--she &apos;s been busy and just , uh ...
does that help at all ?
i can &apos;t believe this . i honest--
i can &apos;t believe that i am here again .
oh , no , no , no , no , no . you &apos;re not doing this .
you &apos;re not going down this rabbit hole .
i have to start all over .
all over . i don &apos;t even know how to do that .
i do .
you might need a little sexual palate cleanser .
a palate cleanser ?
are you serious ?
what ? it works .
sexual sorbet ?
i love it !
i like it .
you see that redhead back there ?
she &apos;s been eyeing you all night .
really ?
okay . yeah . okay .
thank you , mark .
all right . i &apos;m gonna , um ,
i &apos;m gonna go for it .
oh , no . oh , oh .
wish me luck .
all right , liver hemorrhage is under control .
let &apos;s move on .
oh , there &apos;s another one .
nope , two .
what is that ?
part of the steering column , maybe .
might have shattered inside the abdomen .
there &apos;s an infrarenal hematoma .
all right . we should expose the retroperitoneum .
good idea .
i &apos;ll get the aorta below the mesocolon .
slow down , avery .
we need proximal control first .
you keep looking for this kid &apos;s dashboard ,
and i &apos;ll take care of that .
can i get some more light in here , please ?
dr. hunt ?
his parents are here .
they &apos;re asking for an update .
avery .
i &apos;m staying .
i &apos;d--i &apos;d--i &apos;d like to stay .
grey , tell them where we &apos;re at .
okay .
what are you doing in the attendings &apos; lounge ?
you could get in trouble .
pizza ?
i have stupid teenage patients
who superglued themselves together
so their parents can &apos;t tear them apart .
mm . that sounds romantic .
yeah . more like moronic .
i have no idea how to get them apart
without taking off half their skin .
try acetone .
try going away .
meredith , any ideas ?
mm . acetone ?
thank you .
so what &apos;s the deal with stark ?
he &apos;s a lazy , a backstabbing weasel . why ?
because i called him in to examine this patient--
you called him in ?
ha ! i wish i coulda seen that .
you don &apos;t call stark .
well , my kid just had pectus excavatum surgery ,
and he was in serious pain .
yesterday my fundoplication patient was vomiting .
you don &apos;t call stark .
well , this kid &apos;s mother is a nurse at seattle pres .
let &apos;s play a game . there &apos;s one rule .
you don &apos;t call stark .
alex , i &apos;m serious .
normally i would handle this myself .
but i haven &apos;t been on peds in a while ,
and you know the complications with these kids .
did you order blood work and a c.t. ?
i &apos;d add an i.d.h. ,
a c.r.p. and a sed rate .
i mean , with stark ,
you have to cover all your bases .
so if you do end up calling him ,
he has no excuse but to get off his ass and come in .
thank you .
well , turns out , she was eyeing my new haircut
and not me .
i gave her the hairdresser &apos;s number , though , so ...
well , you tried . you put yourself out there .
that &apos;s what counts .
uh , yeah , no .
actually , that counts for nothing .
because i put myself out there every day .
you know , i write online profiles ,
and i check the boxes that say
i like hiking , and dogs , an--
is there a box for fistulas ?
because that &apos;s what i want--
a guy that can talk fistulas .
i want a guy that can direct me
towards a better scientific understanding
of just why a fistula may occur
in patients that are healthy one minute
and die the next .
find a man that &apos;s interested in fistulas and pancreas ,
and you &apos;ll find a man
that &apos;s not internet dating .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
you didn &apos;t call stark again , did you ?
no . i &apos;m not calling him until i get my c.t. results ,
and there &apos;s only one c.t. tech down there ,
and he &apos;s really backed up , so ...
have i mentioned that i hate the night shift
and i hate stark ?
hey , chief . what are you doing here ? it &apos;s late .
well , when a screaming mother calls me at home
to tell me my residents are about to kill her son ,
time becomes irrelevant , wouldn &apos;t you say ?
dr. grey , are you familiar with mrs. mcneil ?
she called you ? i did not give her your number .
she &apos;s a nurse . she worked the system .
but what concerns me is not how she got my number .
it &apos;s why she felt the need to call me in the first place .
now what the hell is going on ? !
i have a plan in place .
i &apos;m just waiting for a c.t. ,
and the guy is just very backed up down there .
how long have you been waiting ?
two hours .
get up .
excuse me ?
get on your feet .
now i understand you &apos;re a little behind schedule .
yeah . it &apos;s just me tonight ,
so we &apos;re backed up .
well , why didn &apos;t you call the on @-@ call tech ?
well , he wasn &apos;t feeling so hot .
i thought i &apos;d cut him a break .
he does the same for me .
listen ... hawk .
we &apos;re in the business of saving lives .
now i don &apos;t care if your friend is lying in a ditch bleeding ,
he will come in tonight .
now get him on the phone . now .
give me that .
hello .
no , this is not your dude . this is chief webber .
what do i need ? i need you to get yourself into this hospital
in the next five minutes , or you and your dude
can kiss your jobs good @-@ bye !
now that &apos;s how you get things done at night .
i just left lucas in surgery .
he &apos;s critical . it &apos;s very touch and go at this point .
but we &apos;re still working , and , um ,
we &apos;ll keep you updated on his condition .
thank you .
okay , thanks .
okay , i &apos;ll let you know .
and reilly ?
our other son--reilly ? how &apos;s reilly ?
h @-@ has anyone talked to you ?
no . we &apos;ve been waiting .
mr. and mrs. nash ,
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m afraid ...
no . no !
i &apos;m sorry to say that ...
please don &apos;t say that .
reilly !
please don &apos;t say that . please don &apos;t say that .
despite our best efforts to save reilly &apos;s life ...
his injuries were too severe ...
not my baby !
and he died in the emergency room .
oh , my god ! my baby ! not my baby !
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , please tell me he &apos;s gonna live .
the parents didn &apos;t even know the brother died .
not to mention how he &apos;s gonna
feel when he finds out .
how do you live with yourself--
shut up ! just shut up . please .
avery .
sorry . sorry . i just--
this is a really tricky part right here .
there &apos;s something ... what is this ?
all right , more suction and some laps in here .
here .
is that a piece of the turn signal ? come on .
it &apos;s right next to the aorta . i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s--
if it &apos;s kissing it or if it &apos;s--it &apos;s perfed .
give me some umbilical tape , and let &apos;s pull it
so we can get some control .
okay , pulling . pulling .
all right .
wait , wait , wait . don &apos;t . don &apos;t , don &apos;t . damn it !
clamp .
give me the clamp .
avery , i &apos;ll do this .
no , give me the clamp . give me the clamp .
here . take this .
got it .
i &apos;ve got the bleeder . i &apos;ve got the bleeder right here .
nice work .
nice work , avery .
so this won &apos;t sting ,
but as the skin starts to separate ,
you may feel some pain .
i feel nothing but pain right now .
me , too .
oh , it &apos;s your mother , lauren .
this is just gonna take a few more minutes , right ?
hopefully .
is it working ? god , i can &apos;t look .
please . if we could just stay together one more day--
well , you &apos;ll definitely be together for another hour ,
because this ... is not working .
yes !
oh , dr. bailey .
yes .
dr. bailey .
oh . i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m not here . you don &apos;t see me .
i just need a nap before i go home ,
but first i need some food .
uh , this will just take a second .
i &apos;ve got these two 15 year olds .
they superglued themselves together .
uh , they &apos;re in love or whatever they think they are .
anyway , i @-@ i tried , uh , petroleum and acetone
to separate them , but--
don &apos;t separate them .
what ?
young people need love , too , kepner .
we all need love .
if the world had more love ,
we could get rid of wars and fistulas .
why won &apos;t this damn thing take my money ?
dr. bailey , are you drunk ?
tipsy .
a @-@ a little tipsy .
right . um , you know , i &apos;m gonna go ahead
and take care of that for you .
oh .
hey , dr. altman .
are you available for a consult ?
i &apos;m just waiting on some c.t. results .
oh , well , joe took my keys , so i &apos;m--i &apos;m pretty sure ...
i shouldn &apos;t be practicing medicine .
well , what are you doing here then ?
well , i &apos;m killing time until joe gives me my keys back .
can &apos;t you do that at the bar ?
cristina yang is bartending ,
so , no , i can &apos;t . it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s too depressing .
cristina &apos;s bartending as , what , some kind of joke or--
as some kind of bartender .
yeah , i know .
that look on your face ? that &apos;s how my whole body feels ,
and not just &apos; cause cristina makes
the world &apos;s strongest drink ,
but because my aspirational couple has broken up ,
and they &apos;re living on two separate continents ,
and &apos; cause i &apos;m dating men
who still live with their mother .
but they don &apos;t admit that on their profiles .
they wait .
they wait--thank you .
they wait until i &apos;ve spent an hour applying my makeup
and driving crosstown ,
and then they tell me that small little detail .
thank you .
oh , oh . and my star student ,
my most promising resident that i have ever seen ,
is mixing irish car bombs for a bachelor party over at joe &apos;s bar .
i &apos;m not even gonna mention
that she &apos;s letting the bachelors feel her up at will ,
&apos;cause that just adds insult to injury .
crap . i &apos;m--i &apos;m really drunk .
pictures are up .
all i &apos;m saying is that that redhead missed out .
if joe &apos;s were a lesbian bar ,
you &apos;d have been up to your ears in ...
please don &apos;t say vagina .
well , now i don &apos;t have to .
god . i hate being drunk .
you think it &apos;s gonna make you feel awesome and happy ,
but it just makes you feel tired and gross .
well , yang looked like she was having fun tonight .
what , the crazy party girl thing ?
that &apos;s crap .
every girl who climbs up on a table
thinks she &apos;s the hottest girl in the room , but ...
really , she &apos;s just dancing alone .
you okay ?
yeah .
i just ... i need to sleep .
i need to sleep .
all right .
drew &apos;s got a perforated ulcer .
and cristina &apos;s working at joe &apos;s .
what ?
forget it . it &apos;s bleeding ,
and it must be from the anti @-@ inflammatories .
wait . wh @-@ what about cristina ?
she &apos;s a bartender now .
i called stark in and no answer .
well , big surprise .
this kid needs surgery .
i know .
mrs. mcneil .
this is alex karev .
he &apos;ll be consulting on your son &apos;s case .
the c.t. scan revealed that your son has a perforated ulcer .
that &apos;s what &apos;s causing his pain .
so does he need surgery ?
yes .
and we &apos;ve called dr. stark ,
and he &apos;s on his way .
we can start prepping him immediately .
thank you . thank you .
okay , so hold on . are we really
gonna call in a whole o.r. team without an attending ?
i mean , what if stark doesn &apos;t answer the page ?
what if he doesn &apos;t come in on time ?

those parents aren &apos;t gonna lose everything because of me .
i call that a pretty great night .

i don &apos;t want to worry them any more than i have to .
no , just ... tell them he &apos;s gonna feel pretty awful ...
that he lived and his brother died ...
that every time he feels glad to be alive ...
he &apos;ll hate himself for it .
just tell them to look out for that .
he won &apos;t want to talk about it ,
but ...
he &apos;ll be glad they know .

he can yell . he will yell .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you know , the kid &apos;s in good shape , the mom &apos;s happy .
we did what we were trained to do .
remember the first day ?
the chief said only two of us would make it .
i thought it would be me and cristina .
how are we the last two standing ?
i am gonna make your lives a living hell .
and you know what ? i &apos;m gonna enjoy it .
you lied to my patients . you hijacked an o.r.
you preformed a surgery
that you had no possible business performing ,
and for the life of me ,
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know what you were thinking .
medicine has a hierarchy for a reason .
if there had been a complication ,
you know whose ass would &apos;ve been on the line here ?
mine ! not yours . mine !
you doctors in this residency ,
you think you can do whatever you want , whenever you want .
i &apos;ve got some news for you . i am the attending !
you are the resident ...
but when the sun rises ...
you have to take responsibility ...
for what you did in the dark ...
i had to use soap and water .
what ?
the acetone didn &apos;t work on the superglue
till i mixed it with soap and water .
i could use a little soap and water right now .
i feel disgusting .
i can smell you from up here .
dibs on the shower .
i want a beer . who &apos;s up for a beer ?
where are you gonna get a beer at 6 : 00 a.m. ?
at home .
and face yourself under the cold , harsh ...
light of day .
water ?
oh , no .
good morning .
