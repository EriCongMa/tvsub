no begging . no begging .
stella , you &apos;re breaking my heart here .
what &apos;s breaking your heart is that sausage and bacon .
can &apos;t you just pick one ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m gonna burn it off
on the golf course .
how , jay ?
by riding the little cart
or by kicking the ball back into play ?
here . i &apos;m gonna take joe fulgencio to the park .
can you please stop by the grocery store ?
why doesn &apos;t the nanny do this ?
you got to be kidding me !
gloria has fired five nannies .
i don &apos;t like another woman in my house .
i want to be the star .
stars have nannies .
you know that some of this is manny &apos;s fault .
manny !
so , marie , what do you feel like doing for dinner tonight ?
you &apos;re eating dyno @-@ bites
because you are a little boy .
mom !
i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s an embarrassing
press conference in that kid &apos;s future .
we &apos;re getting married in seven months .
or eight months .
i worry about it raining in april .
well , i worry about me sweating in may .
oh , well , we can &apos;t decide on anything .
there -- there are too many choices .
fortunately , one of our best friends
is an event planner .
pepper !
pepper !
* here come the grooms *
* all dressed in fun tuxes from my pepper collection *
ha , wow -- look at all your ideas .
honey , this is just the index .
ronaldo !
i brought linens and place settings
and invitations and stemware .
hello . i &apos;m ronaldo .
oh , don &apos;t be such a chatterbox .
and go and fetch the platter box .
now , let &apos;s lose this couch .
wow , you need that much space , huh ?
no , it &apos;s hideous .
this can &apos;t be news to you .
you &apos;re ruining my life !
these eggs are delicious .
what life ? ! get out of my room !
i put milk in them .
it &apos;s not your room anymore !
well , they sure are fluffy .
mom !
hey , dad .
morning , troops .
claire , i owe you a pack of lady razors .
i &apos;m just gonna go stand out in the yard .
seriously , get out !
i told you it &apos;s not your room !
tension between haley and alex
has been getting pretty high ,
so our solution was to move haley down to the basement ,
which we were just about to do --
when my dad came out for a weekend visit .
two weekends ago .
after my mom passed away ,
he dated this woman named annie ,
and she broke up with him ,
and then he seemed kind of down ,
so i invited him out .
gross ! those are my socks !
they are not ! mom !
i &apos;m just gonna pop outside .
i should get her a rake .
welcome to king &apos;s landing !
i am the evil boy king ,
and i want your heads !
oh , look how much they all love you .
ohh , thanks .
i &apos;m just trying to match the energy
of their video games and whosits and whatnots .
so , i &apos;m gonna play tennis .
i can pick you up at noon .
oh , hi ! joan , right ?
yes .
hi . i &apos;m andy .
i &apos;m her manny -- male nanny .
hi , i &apos;m gloria .
this might just sound a little crazy ,
but i don &apos;t think joan likes me .
oh , that &apos;s not crazy . she doesn &apos;t .
her husband &apos;s always staring at you ,
and she &apos;s worried you &apos;re gonna steal him .
what ? !
be happy , little guy .
this world belongs to you .
i would never steal anybody else &apos;s man ,
especially not her fat husband .
hey , he &apos;s not fat anymore .
i helped him lose 30 pounds .
thank you , andy .
careful .
if i bring you home scratched ,
i lose my deposit .
i &apos;m kind of a chef , too .
here , try this .
it &apos;s quinoa .
you actually burn calories while eating i--
so , andy , tell me ,
are you really happy with that joan ?
every wedding is unique , like a snowflake .
and my job is to give you
the snowflake that makes everyone die with jealousy .
that &apos;s all we ever wanted .
so , let &apos;s start with a color palette .
i &apos;m thinking ...
purple .
purple ! that is a color !
wow !
we don &apos;t love -- yeah , we don &apos;t love purple .
not our favorite , but ...
excuse me ?
well , it &apos;s just that purple
might be a little bit bold for --
no , i get it . you think i &apos;m an idiot .
no . no !
no , we don &apos;t , pepper .
well , obviously , you know better than i.
after all , i &apos;ve only put on
hundreds of magnificent weddings .
come , ronaldo .
they &apos;re not interested in planning a wedding .
they &apos;re interested in hurting people .
no , pepper . pepper , wait .
no , pepper , wait . listen . no , no .
we can consider purple .
this is just a lot for us to take in .
of course . i get it . i ...
let the idea wash over you for a bit .
we had also discussed a more neutral palette .
ronaldo ! they &apos;re washing !
i &apos;m sorry . he means well .
now , let &apos;s talk about your entrance .
yes . entrance .
the idea of two men being able to marry
seemed like a fantasy ,
so i see you riding down the purple aisle
on a ...
... unicorn .
are you sure , grandpa ? it might be fun .
sorry , luke . i just don &apos;t think i have it in me today .
did you see that ?
when has your dad ever
not wanted to pull luke &apos;s finger ?
he &apos;s hurting , phil .
i think he needs to see a therapist .
claire , he doesn &apos;t need a therapist .
why ? honey , that &apos;s what they do .
they help people cope with loss .
they &apos;ll even come to the house if we need them to .
i should talk to my dad . you know what ?
he was pretty down after the divorce .
i bet he has some insight .
yeah , &apos; cause your dad &apos;s
so in touch with people &apos;s feelings ?
when a man is overcome with emotion
at a celine dion concert ,
you do not tell him to grow a pair !
phil !
the ship went down , but their love lasts forever !
dad ? hi .
yeah , listen . uh , frank is really depressed .
i think he should see a therapist .
what do you say ?
he doesn &apos;t need any of that !
yeah ? uh @-@ huh . t @-@ that &apos;s exactly what i said .
give me that .
i @-@ i ...
jay , what did you just say ?
take him out and meet some women .
1,000 therapists couldn &apos;t do what gloria did for me .
oh , i agree . claire was wrong .
i &apos;ll tell you what . i know a fun place .
tonight , you , me , and frank out on the town .
oh , fun ! a three @-@ way !
i already regret this .
well , i &apos;m excited , too . i got to get going , though .
all right . bye .
gloria , we &apos;re back !
here ! let me lighten your load .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the new manny .
am i being replaced ?
jay , manny , meet joe &apos;s new manny , andy .
can i talk to you a second ?
no , thank you .
we &apos;re gonna need to discuss this .
i get it . i understand it &apos;s a big decision .
but if it eases your mind at all ,
know that i &apos;m not just here for baby joe .
i &apos;m here for you , too .
doesn &apos;t ease my mind at all .
my mission is to make all of your lives
happier and healthier .
is this because i ate that party sub ?
ohh ! crackers !
i left my phone upstairs in the nursery .
could you grab it for me ?
i know people get all squirrelly
when they hear the word &quot; healthy . &quot;
actually , manny ? my phone is in my pocket .
sorry , bud .
but my goal is to get you healthy without --
nope !
it is just a pack of gum .
my phone is still upstairs .
- without you even realizing what &apos;s happening .
wow . i &apos;m such a dodo .
i didn &apos;t even bring my phone today .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
we are gonna talk about it .
okay , well , you have my number , so i can start tomorrow .
call me .
i will !
take care !
that &apos;s a nonstarter . keep looking .
but he &apos;s perfect .
he &apos;s a man . it &apos;s weird .
he &apos;s a weird man .
he &apos;s like phil , only i have to pay for him .
this is not a dictatorship ! it &apos;s a democracy !
we vote !
no way . you always bully manny , and he caves .
he &apos;s weak .
no offense .
whoever thinks that we should hire andy ,
raise the hand !
no , sorry , mom . not this time .
i can &apos;t have that energy in my house .
fine . cook your own dinner !
we will . we &apos;ll be fine .
so , what are we having ?
you &apos;re on your own , kid . i &apos;m going out tonight .
so , what do you think ?
i like it .
also , is it a little willy wonka ?
you &apos;re tired . i &apos;ll come back tomorrow
when you &apos;re ready to be more constructive .
pepper , no .
pepper .
ronaldo , strike this .
sorry . i thought i was wearing a cape today .
oh . oh , my gosh .
ohh . what are we gonna do ?
i @-@ i think we have to fire pepper .
that would kill him .
he &apos;s on the brink as it is .
why ?
since the proposition ocho was overturned ,
he &apos;s done 50 gay weddings .
the man is exhausted , searching for new ideas .
you said &quot; ocho &quot;
and then you said &quot; 50 . &quot;
you see ? gays are so nit @-@ picky .
in a straight wedding ,
you just have to please the bride ,
but the gays have such strong opinions !
it takes a toll on a great artist
like pepper saltzman .
you know , i &apos;ve never thought of it that way .
i mean , look at us . we can &apos;t agree on one thing .
no , you &apos;re right .
i mean , cam wants a rustic country theme ,
and i &apos;m looking for something
a little more contemporary and sophisticated .
and it &apos;s impossible .
but you can have both .
casual elegance , classic with a twist .
go on .
i &apos;d start with raw , natural @-@ linen table runners
to bring the two worlds together .
we eschew the classic round tables
for rectangular farm tables ,
but keep the setting clean and modern .
and then ...
yes !
no , i mustn &apos;t . this is wrong .
pepper is my boss and my mentor !
oh , and he &apos;s our friend . what are we doing ?
we -- we got caught up . we gave in to temptation .
i @-@ i should go .
don &apos;t !
i must .
vintage handkerchiefs for the guests to cry into .
ronaldo , wait !
french bistro stemless wine glasses .
i &apos;ve said too much .
ronaldo !
he &apos;s gone , cam .
guys , we can &apos;t stand around all night .
at some point , we have to talk to somebody .
now , come on . how about those two ?
let &apos;s go over there .
oh , my god . i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m so nervous .
hello , ladies .
not interested .
wow . i @-@ i just said hello .
we &apos;re just kind of having a girls &apos; night .
kathy , be nice . i &apos;m marcy .
i &apos;m jay . this is frank and , uh , phil .
hey @-@ lo . i mean hey . or hello .
i don &apos;t know .
and for the record , i just wanted to introduce my friend .
i wasn &apos;t trying to pick you up or anything .
i &apos;m heartbroken .
we don &apos;t mean to disturb you .
oh , you &apos;re not disturbing us .
you have sweet eyes .
thank you . i &apos;m from florida .
i love florida !
would you like to sit down , frank ?
well , i , uh -- yeah , sure .
oh , my god . it &apos;s happening .
for your information , i &apos;m married to a gorgeous woman .
dad , jay and i
are gonna grab a drink from the bar .
sure .
i think i have a picture of her here on this somewhere .
let &apos;s go , jay .
yeah , she won beauty pageants .
okay . i &apos;m a catch .
let &apos;s get out of here . this place is dead , anyway .
hey , there &apos;s casanova !
i didn &apos;t hear you come in last night .
so -- so , uh , how did it go with marcy ?
oh , it was okay .
but i actually met someone else
while i was waiting for a taxi .
well , all right .
and she &apos;s downstairs right now .
well , all right .
truth is , i , um , have a bit of a situation .
she says i owe her $ 500 .
please tell me you broke something of hers .
no , turns out she &apos;s a hooker .
you picked up a hooker ?
well , i didn &apos;t know she was a hooker .
we &apos;re in my kitchen . we have to stop saying &quot; hooker &quot; !
you got to get her out of here
before claire gets back from yoga .
she &apos;s not gonna leave until she gets the cash .
$ 500 ? i think you got ripped off .
hey , can i have a hit of that coffee ?
oh , that &apos;s fine .
trust me . he did not get ripped off .
no , that &apos;s good . it &apos;s yours .
$ 247 . i &apos;m gonna have to run to an atm .
how could you not know ? !
well , the drinks , the flirting .
i couldn &apos;t think straight .
have you ever touched the smooth ,
taut skin of a 48 @-@ year @-@ old woman ?
i hope to one day ,
but that &apos;s not gonna happen if claire gets home and --
hi ! i &apos;m back !
frank , did you have fun last night ?
no . he did not .
hey . who &apos;s the woman in the kitchen ?
beats me . i think i &apos;ll go freshen up .
there &apos;s a woman in the kitchen ?
there &apos;s a woman in the kitchen . yeah , she &apos;s a therapist .
the therapist that you recommended .
so i decided it was a good idea .
oh , that means the world that you listened to me .
thank you !
ohh , you should get a shower upstairs .
oh , no , i want to say hi .
no , not sweaty like that .
you smell .
no , uh ...
hi ! hi , i &apos;m claire .
i &apos;m frank &apos;s daughter @-@ in @-@ law ,
and i just want to thank you so much
for coming and helping him out this way .
it was my idea .
no , it wasn &apos;t .
okay .
all right .
no , hey . i &apos;ve never told anyone this ,
but i have always wanted to do what you do .
i think i &apos;d be really good at it .
no , she wouldn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s basically what i already do for the whole neighborhood .
at least this way , i get paid for it .
you know , i got a standing 10 : 30 i got to get to .
yes . yes , you do !
mom , i &apos;m gonna throw up !
alex &apos;s hair smells like cheese !
it is not cheese !
it is cruelty @-@ free organic shampoo
with traces of churned goat &apos;s milk !
so cheese !
ew , i need a bucket !
ladies , we have a guest .
i am -- i &apos;m really sorry about this .
i &apos;m just at my wit &apos;s end with these two .
i don &apos;t suppose you have any experience with teenagers ?
oh , no .
you two remind me of me and my sister .
we used to fight all the time .
i used to accuse her of stealing my boyfriend .
she would accuse me of trying to stab her .
you know , sister stuff .
oh , my god .
trust me , if i wanted to stab her ,
that skank be stabbed .
she &apos;s not a therapist , is she ?
just ...
i didn &apos;t sleep a wink .
i @-@ i cannot stop thinking about ronaldo .
i know .
i dreamt our wedding made
the cover of modern gay grooms
and that there was a magazine called modern gay grooms .
okay , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s pepper .
let &apos;s just ask him to let ronaldo take the lead .
and -- and risk hurting pepper ?
for all we know ,
ronaldo hasn &apos;t even given us a second thought .
i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about you .
what happened here yesterday was real .
oh , ronaldo ! we felt it , too .
but what about pepper ?
i left him .
what ?
it &apos;s over . he doesn &apos;t look at me the way you do .
ohh , this is all happening so fast .
for me , too .
but my heart was racing when i left here .
you are my muses @-@ es .
ohh . i feel so guilty .
one quick look . no one has to know .
oh , ronaldo , what have you done ?
mitchell ! cameron !
oh , no !
uh , uh , quick ! hide !
yeah , yeah , yeah ! i &apos;ll hide .
cam , not you .
okay , yeah . go , go , go , go , go .
ronaldo left me .
what ? ! no !
the swine !
someone put it in his head that he could do this without me .
but mark my words , i will destroy him
and whatever wedding he thinks he &apos;s planning .
okay , well , that &apos;s one way to go .
daddies , there &apos;s a man in the bathroom .
what ? - that -- that &apos;s a wiggles song .
that &apos;s a wiggles song .
* daddy , there &apos;s a man in the bathroom *
* there &apos;s a man in the bathroom *
it &apos;s okay , honey . it &apos;s okay .
* he &apos;s in the shower *
ronaldo was nothing before i found him ,
living in squalor in a dump barely bigger than this .
how could he do this to me ?
because you never listen to anybody !
i have good ideas , but you &apos;re too thick @-@ headed to hear them !
ronaldo , how did you get here ?
it was you two . you plotted against me .
i bet that &apos;s not even a wiggles song , is it ?
is it ? !
no .
pepper , we can explain .
do you have any idea how hard i work ?
well , maybe that &apos;s part of the problem .
i mean , you &apos;ve been through the mill , pepper .
heard it .
i &apos;ve done 53 gay weddings .
and ... none of them are mine .
ohh . pepper .
and whose fault is that ?
i feel like you &apos;re implying mine ,
but i really don &apos;t see it .
how can a man with such flare for setting tables
leave no seat for one who loves him ? !
oh , my god .
ronaldo &apos;s in love with pepper .
i know . that &apos;s why i said , &quot; oh , my god . &quot;
pepper , do you hear what ronaldo is saying ?
of course i do . i &apos;m not a fool .
he thinks i can &apos;t set a table .
no . no , no , no .
ronaldo is in love with you . go to him .
what ?
you &apos;re in love with me ?
si . it is true . yes .
god , that would drive me crazy .
ronaldo , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
i mean , of course , when i hired you ,
i found you very attractive .
that &apos;s why i hire all my people .
but i ...
i never thought you ...
would find me ...
perfecto ?
because that &apos;s what you are -- perfect .
no . i &apos;m out . i &apos;m out . i &apos;m out . i can &apos;t .
gloria , i forgot my towel !
here it is . nice and toasty from the dryer .
gloria !
she ran to the store . breakfast in 5 .
your underpants are pressed and on your bed .
gloria !
so , if i &apos;m hearing you right , you &apos;re not so much mad
about the prostitute in the kitchen
as you are about my lying to you .
no , i &apos;m mad about the prostitute in the kitchen .
hmm . that &apos;s my bad .
yes , it is . it &apos;s your bad , frank . very bad .
look , i &apos;m a progressive woman .
i @-@ i took a pole @-@ dancing class .
i sent my daughter to college with condoms .
wait , now , i think that sends the wrong message .
thank you very much .
no ! you don &apos;t get to judge !
i ... frank , i &apos;m --
i know you &apos;re upset about annie breaking up with you .
wait , annie didn &apos;t break up with me .
i broke up with her .
w @-@ what ?
why ? i thought she was so great !
well , i got scared . i didn &apos;t know how to ...
be with another woman .
i thought your mother and i would be together forever .
ah ... i &apos;m sorry , dad .
i never would have gone through with it last night ,
but , uh , jeannie was so nice and professional .
well , thank you , frank .
and for what it &apos;s worth ,
you got nothing to be nervous about .
you were wonderful .
really ? you think so ?
yeah .
if you love that woman , you should go get her back .
she &apos;ll be lucky to have you .
seriously , i see a lot of guys your age .
most of them can barely --
okay . let &apos;s get you in that cab .
i love your kids .
that alex is like a little me .
yeah !
oh , my god .
good morning , boss , junior boss .
grab a seat and check it out .
egg @-@ white omelet , high @-@ protein smoothies ,
then i thought we could put on our running shoes and go ...
i need to cut you off right there , chief .
seems my wife overstepped her bounds .
now , you seem like a nice guy .
thanks .
but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re the best fit for this house .
are -- are you serious ? - i &apos;m afraid so .
okay .
it was the underpants , wasn &apos;t it ?
that didn &apos;t help .
man , i came on too strong . gosh dang it !
my dad warned me about that when i turned 14 .
he said , &quot; son , you &apos;re about to be the man of the family .
you got to learn to give people time
to see how special you are . &quot;
why were you the man of the family ?
he sort of died .
how ?
i don &apos;t want to bring you down , little man .
neither did my dad .
he &apos;d say , &quot; my disease can &apos;t be all bad
if it rhymes with &apos; answer . &apos; &quot;
those are the flaxseed muffins that i just baked .
i &apos;ll just take them out and get out of here .
andy , wait .
we &apos;re never gonna eat them .
well , then ... i &apos;m sorry it didn &apos;t work out .
what didn &apos;t work out ?
my mission here .
it was really nice to meet you , though , mrs. p.
you didn &apos;t even give him a chance .
we took a vote , mom .
you got to respect the vote .
no ! you make me hire these nannies that i don &apos;t like .
but when i find one that i like , you fire him ? !
i am the one that spends most of the time around here !
so i get to pick !
sometimes the louder we are , the less we &apos;re heard .
you &apos;re frustrated right now , aren &apos;t you ?
yes .
because you feel like they &apos;re not hearing you .
yes .
well , that &apos;s exactly how they feel .
i &apos;m sorry that i ignored your feelings .
i promise that i will try not to yell so much .
you &apos;re hired .
what ? !
you better drink that smoothie . we &apos;re going on a run !
this isn &apos;t over .
life isn &apos;t easy .
sometimes we just need a little help ,
getting your confidence back ,
getting on the same page ,
getting out of your own way ,
or just getting moving .
and i &apos;m pleased as punch to be the one --
okay , this is tough enough without all the yammering !
sorry .
what would you like to dance to ?
i have to tell you we have to have some sort of square dancing .
we &apos;re not doing country .
no square dancing . we &apos;re not .
there will be no hoedown tonight . pepper and i are on ...
my family is going to throw a fit .
they &apos;ll riot .
we &apos;re not getting married for them .
we &apos;re getting married for us .
and i think we have a decorative cake out front ,
and then we have sheet cakes in the back .
oh , i see ! is that the theme you &apos;re going for
- tacky ? !
sheet -- like a sheet .
oh , &quot; sheet . &quot;
i thought he said &quot; chic cake . &quot;
