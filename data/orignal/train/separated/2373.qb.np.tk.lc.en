does elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar ?
i &apos;ve heard about you .
the crazy , impulsive vampire .
in love with his brother &apos;s girl .
i wanted you to have this .
oh , my god , it &apos;s beautiful .
i can &apos;t give up on you , stefan .
it &apos;s done . i don &apos;t want to see you .
i don &apos;t want to be with you .
daddy ?
i &apos;m conditioning you to associate vampirism with pain .
hello , bill .
a hybrid out to make more hybrids ?
so what am i doing wrong ?
we &apos;d have to contact the witch who created it .
well , that would be the original witch .
bring me rebekah . she has what i need .
time to wake up , little sister .
it &apos;s beautiful .
a witch gave it to me .
what do you have that gloria needs ?
where &apos;s my necklace ?
tell me that &apos;s not what she needs !
there has to be more to this dress .
there &apos;s not .
so women in the 21st century dress like prostitutes , then .
you know , i got dirty looks for wearing trousers .
you wore trousers so women today could wear nothing .
and what is this music ? it sounds like a cable car accident .
it &apos;s dance music .
you would dance to this ?
are we done ?
and why are you so grumpy ?
i needed one thing from you for my witch
to find out why my hybrids are dying , one thing .
your necklace . and you lost it .
i didn &apos;t lose it . it &apos;s just been missing for 90 years .
so what do you think ?
i like it .
what ? i said i like it .
i can always tell when you &apos;re lying , stefan .
nice one , good work .
you &apos;re the one that pulled the dagger out of her .
i heard that .
all right . i &apos;m going to get some fresh air .
i just don &apos;t know why you want to bring chili to a potluck .
everybody brings chili .
hey , ric . what &apos;s up ?
what time do you want to go to the lockwood party ?
ah . those founders parties aren &apos;t really my thing .
show up , there &apos;s going to be nine other people that brought chili .
it &apos;s an old family recipe , ok ?
yeah ! i know . i knew your old family .
they made sucky chili .
why are you here , exactly ?
she knows .
he thinks i &apos;m going to break .
i &apos;m not going to break . i am just going to keep making chili ,
pretend like i didn &apos;t just spend the entire summer
looking for someone who didn &apos;t want to be found .
she &apos;s in denial .
i &apos;m not in denial .
no ?
you &apos;re still wearing this necklace .
isn &apos;t this the reminder of your unbreakable bond with stefan ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
you two look chummy .
klaus your new bestie ?
you know , if he finds out you &apos;re in chicago , you &apos;re dead .
happy to know that you still care .
so tell me if i &apos;m wrong--
rebekah &apos;s necklace that klaus is looking for ...
that &apos;s the necklace that you gave to elena .
bye , katherine .
hey , hey . wait .
you &apos;re up to something , tell me .
they don &apos;t know where the necklace is .
i just have to keep them from figuring it out .
i have it all under control .
please tell me you have a better plan than that .
you do .
come on , stefan .
you &apos;re not the diabolical type .
whatever you &apos;re planning , it &apos;s not going to work .
well , if the most diabolical
woman i know can &apos;t seem to figure it out ,
then i must be doing something right .
i forgot . you &apos;re bad now .
don &apos;t get too cocky .
klaus is smarter than you . he &apos;s smarter than everyone .
and i &apos;ve heard about that sister .
be careful .
she &apos;ll ruin you .
happy to know you still care .
jeremy .
anna !
you heard me ?
what are you doing here ?
wait , like heard me , heard me , or did it sound more like a- -
where have you been ?
i need to know you can hear me .
you drop in , you tell me not to trust vicki ,
and then you disappear ?
jeremy ! tell me you can hear me .
yeah , yeah , i can hear you , all right ?
what the hell !
what is it ?
i &apos;ve been trying to get you to hear me for days .
yelling your name and screaming .
you have ?
what changed ?
i &apos;ve been trying to get through to you ,
why now ?
i was dreaming about you .
i ...
you were dreaming about me ?
i can &apos;t believe this is actually happening .
that you &apos;re actually here .
i &apos;m here .
i come bearing gifts .
please say that &apos;s not chili .
bonnie !
i &apos;m back !
hi !
i leave town for the summer
and everything goes to hell for the both of you .
bonnie !
jeremy !
so mayor lockwood
called your gay ex @-@ husband
to torture your vampire daughter .
yes . i &apos;ve been keeping him detained
to make sure the vervain &apos;s out of his system .
so you could , you know ...
can &apos;t we just kill him ?
no , damon ! he &apos;s caroline &apos;s father .
he sounds like a douchebag to me .
yeah , well , just &apos; cause you and i are on ok terms
doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m a suddenly a big
advocate for your &quot; lifestyle . &quot;
is that what you told him
when you two got divorced ?
double check him for vervain
before you compel him .
you brought another vampire into this ?
it &apos;s the best thing for all of us , bill .
so , bill , i hear you &apos;re into the whole
daddy @-@ daughter vampire torture thing .
i was trying to help her .
well , if there &apos;s anyone who doesn &apos;t need help ,
it &apos;s your annoying control freak of a daughter .
yep .
he &apos;s vervain @-@ free .
just erase his memory , damon .
so , bill , i have a question .
what makes you think that you can change
the basic nature of a vampire ?
the mind &apos;s a powerful tool .
it can be trained and retrained .
you just have to be strong enough .
oh , yeah ? i completely agree .
i actually happen to love mind control , myself .
you will leave town immediately .
all you remember is you came to bring your daughter
back to school shopping .
you left us .
yeah , sorry .
retail therapy was making my head explode .
tell me about it .
what &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s failing .
it &apos;s hard to find something
when you don &apos;t have anything to go on .
so use me .
i only wore it for a thousand years .
see ? now this one offers a solution .
all right , give me your hand , sweetheart .
she &apos;s , uh , she &apos;s looking for the necklace , huh ?
the problem with my dad &apos;s normal side of the family
is normal made for a really boring summer .
after the last few days ,
i would kill for a normal family .
since when did you learn how to cook ?
damon helped a little .
damon &apos;s helping you cook now ?
both of you stop judging .
he &apos;s just trying to be a good- - ow !
ahh ! did i splash you ?
no , no , my necklace .
i can sense something .
it burned me .
maybe it &apos;s a sign you shouldn &apos;t be wearing it .
caroline ...
what , i &apos;m just saying .
if you &apos;re going to be &quot; cooking &quot; without stefan .
let me see it .
i found it .
so where is it ?
it doesn &apos;t work like that , doll .
i get images .
there &apos;s a girl with her friends--
yes , a dead girl with dead friends ,
if i don &apos;t get my necklace back .
well , i &apos;ll have to dive back in to get the details .
so dive .
i need more time .
and space .
you &apos;re harshing my ju @-@ ju .
we can wait .
i &apos;m sure you can .
but that &apos;s not what i asked .
hey , you know , why don &apos;t we just come back later .
i &apos;m hungry anyway .
i &apos;ll let you pick who we eat .
hey . ok , i got it .
i have an identification spell that might be able to tell me
what magic affected the necklace .
it &apos;s going to take a while , so tell me if anyone &apos;s coming , ok ?
so you &apos;re not , like , switching salvatores , are you ?
what ?
caroline ...
stay focused .
as your friend who worries for you daily ,
what is the deal with you and damon ?
there is no deal .
he &apos;s been just as focused on finding stefan as i have .
yeah , but that doesn &apos;t make him any less damon .
if my own father , who i love dearly , can &apos;t change me ?
no one &apos;s changing damon .
not even you .
look , why are we even talking about this ?
hey . guys ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not doing anything .
it has its own magic .
i &apos;m going to let you in on a little secret--
founders parties are just an excuse for the council
to gather in back rooms and plot against vampires .
i think you need to take a beat with elena .
excuse me ?
whatever it is you two have going on ,
i think it &apos;s a bad idea .
i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s your problem , ric .
it is my problem . i &apos;m supposed to look after her ,
and this is me doing that .
what do you think i &apos;m doing ?
what i think is you need to take a beat .
damon ? sorry .
uh , the mayor just called the council meeting .
my girl &apos;s dead . i &apos;m bored .
you weren &apos;t kidding about being hungry .
yeah .
it &apos;s been a long day .
try being related to her .
you &apos;re being mean .
and why are you being mean ? you used to love me .
it &apos;s been 90 years , rebekah . give him a minute .
why are you taking his side ?
because , my dear sister , i feel pity
for any man who doesn &apos;t give you what you want .
will you stop making me out to be a brat ?
i am not a brat !
a thousand years of life experience says otherwise .
well , you &apos;re no picnic , either .
i mean , i &apos;ve only spent one summer with you
and i feel like i want to blow my head off .
fantastic .
i need to go .
where &apos;s he going ?
to write a name on a wall .
it &apos;s a long story .
anna ?
look , where are you ? we don &apos;t have much time .
we &apos;ve got all the time in the world .
i &apos;m sorry about before . i just got , um , distracted .
it &apos;s fine . i get it .
why haven &apos;t you told her ?
well , she &apos;s been gone all summer .
yeah , i know that .
now why haven &apos;t you told her , really ?
i don &apos;t know . you know , i don &apos;t even understand
how any of this is possible .
well , it &apos;s kind of a push and pull .
i &apos;m pushing from the other side trying to contact you ,
and sometimes , like just now , if you pull ...
the other side ? is that ...
is that what it &apos;s called ?
that &apos;s what i call it .
i &apos;m all by myself here .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m a part of your world ,
only no one can see me . i &apos;m just ...
on the other side .
wait , what about vicki ?
whenever you say you see her ,
i feel something .
a darkness .
and when i try to tell you not to let her in ,
something crazy happens .
like , she &apos;s trying to push me out .
like the windows breaking .
just be careful .
try not to let her in .
&apos;cause she can &apos;t get through if you &apos;re not open to it .
you don &apos;t understand how amazing it is
to finally be able to talk to you .
i &apos;m all by myself here . i mean ,
i don &apos;t have anyone .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know you can &apos;t feel anything .
do it again .
there you are .
thought you were resting .
well , now we both have a secret .
what did you see ?
it &apos;s what i heard that &apos;s interesting .
you know , the girls with the necklace ,
they were talking about you .
yet you didn &apos;t tell klaus .
why ?
&apos;cause i wouldn &apos;t help that hybrid half @-@ breed with anything .
the necklace is a talisman from the original witch herself .
i want it .
well , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t help you .
don &apos;t be difficult .
you know , i &apos;d hate to have to tell klaus
what a liar his sidekick is .
guess i &apos;ve got to get it out of you the hard way , huh ?
what is this ?
why can &apos;t i move ?
relax . it &apos;s just a little paralysis spell .
nothing major .
just got to get the information out of your pretty little head .
you know , witches now days ,
they &apos;re into that new age stuff , but ...
i &apos;m a little more old school voodoo .
this will stop that pesky healing .
i won &apos;t tell you anything .
you don &apos;t have to .
you feel that ?
that &apos;s your essence .
your spirit . it lets me make a connection .
herbs help , too .
diviner &apos;s sage , witch hazel .
but my personal favorite ...
vervain .
there have no been no incidence of question since spring .
it &apos;s been quiet .
anyone else have anything to add to the minutes ?
damon ?
ah , no , i think the sheriff covered it ,
mayor lockwood .
looks like we &apos;ve made it through the worst .
well , i have nothing new to add ,
so thank you all for coming .
good to see you .
carol .
damon .
i have a question .
bill .
do you three think that
everybody on the council is clueless ...
or just stupid ?
ok , tell me if you see anything in these grimoires
that involves precious medals
or a symbol that resembles a necklace .
well , can &apos;t you just ask
all the dead witches you were channeling ?
i don &apos;t have access to them anymore .
they cut me off .
since when ?
since i brought you back to life .
i messed with the balance of nature
and there were consequences .
hey . i &apos;m sorry .
i know i should have told you .
i told elena when it happened .
i just didn &apos;t want you to feel weird about it , you know ?
hey , no , no , look , you don &apos;t have to apologize for anything .
ok ? you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
elena said you &apos;ve been having kind of a hard time since then .
no , i &apos;m fine . you know , just been , ah ,
a little out of it lately .
so should i concentrate on the older books ?
or , uh , i mean , how old is this necklace ?
old . yeah .
jeremy . the darkness . it &apos;s here .
jeremy !
are you ok ? !
what the hell just happened ?
i have no idea .
i &apos;m impressed .
you &apos;ve got discipline , stefan .
it &apos;s not going to do you much good , but ...
just let go , honey .
there we go , there we go .
there &apos;s the girl with the necklace .
you love her .
you &apos;d do anything for her , and you have .
a lot of darkness , a lot of guilt .
all to keep her away from klaus .
why would he be interested in one girl ?
don &apos;t do this . don &apos;t do this .
she &apos;s the doppelganger .
she &apos;s supposed to be dead , and that &apos;s why klaus
can &apos;t make hybrids , isn &apos;t it ?
well , this is creepy .
maybe you do need my help , after all .
did stefan ever tell you where he got the necklace ?
no , and i never asked .
hopefully bonnie will be able to figure it out .
please tell me it &apos;s time to go .
beyond . where &apos;s damon ?
probably off somewhere doing bad things to good people .
consider me the honesty please .
what is it ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s my dad .
why would he even show up here ?
i don &apos;t know . but i can &apos;t--
i get it .
i &apos;ll call you later .
ok .
ok , what &apos;s that all about ?
speaking of doing bad things to good people ...
wait , wait , houston , we have a problem .
where have you been ?
managing bill forbes .
apparently he &apos;s impervious to compulsion .
how ?
i have no idea .
but he threatened to out me .
don &apos;t get me started on the irony of that .
what did you do to him ?
how do you know the compulsion doesn &apos;t work ?
that &apos;s not the most important piece of information
i mentioned , elena .
what does he want ?
he wants to control the council .
says it &apos;s been compromised .
it has !
he wants to put vervain in the town &apos;s water supply .
maybe it &apos;s not a bad idea .
i mean , it &apos;ll help you keep yourself in control .
now that stefan &apos;s not here to--
to what ?
to keep me in check ? make me behave ?
i should have killed him this morning .
he &apos;s caroline &apos;s dad , damon .
yeah ,
and when i kill him , she &apos;ll have one more parent than we do .
oh , come on , damon !
you &apos;re repeatedly killing my buzz today , ric .
step aside .
yeah , it &apos;s not going to happen .
your temporary funeral .
damon , no !
what is wrong with you ? !
i &apos;ve been thinking about your diabolical plan .
oh . do tell .
well , you must know that klaus is too paranoid
to ever fully trust you .
but the sister , she loves you like it was yesterday .
she &apos;s the easier mark .
but you can &apos;t just pretend to care ,
because klaus will know better .
so you do the opposite .
you bond with him ; make her feel left out .
that will only make her want you more .
oh ! so you mean , i &apos;m , uh ,
i &apos;m taking a page out of the katherine pierce playbook .
the only question is why , stefan ?
i mean , i get it , you want to keep klaus away from mystic falls ,
but ... what else do you expect to get from it ?
you know what &apos;s funny ?
you keep talking to me
like i actually trust you enough to tell you anything .
oh , come on , stefan , we &apos;re beyond that .
i saved you from hilda the high voodoo priestess .
ok .
i knew them , back in the twenties .
they were running from someone .
someone who scared them .
the hunter .
i heard stories about him centuries ago .
don &apos;t you want to know why an original vampire
who can &apos;t be killed
is afraid of a vampire hunter ?
if you &apos;re planning on making a move against klaus ...
i want in .
that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s good to want things , katherine .
stefan ...
katherine .
i &apos;m in this alone .
if you &apos;re looking for a diabolical partner in crime ,
i suggest you look elsewhere .
how was football practice ?
what are you doing here ?
hiding out from my dad .
he &apos;s here .
are you ok ?
do you want me to kick his ass ?
yes .
no .
i bought him the shirt he &apos;s wearing , it is really expensive .
and through everything ...
he &apos;s still my dad .
you know ?
god , you reek !
what ?
that is bad .
no , this ?
this is sexy .
no ! it &apos;s really bad .
no ?
oh ! hang on , my phone .
oh , come on !
i &apos;m only answering in case it &apos;s a friend emergency .
it &apos;s an emergency .
whoa , whoa . is that scotch ?
i figured you for an abstainer .
everything in moderation .
keeps the mind clear from ... influence .
like vampire compulsion .
yeah , i tried to tell you--
yeah , yeah , powerful tool . got it .
i &apos;m impressed .
can &apos;t say i &apos;ve ever seen that before .
well , it takes a certain human focus .
it &apos;s a skill that i &apos;ve been honing for decades .
plus , your technique ... is a little lazy .
duly noted .
i &apos;m curious .
why not just expose us to the council ?
i know you think i &apos;m the bad guy here , damon ,
but i would never expose my own daughter to those morons .
it &apos;s a pretty risky move , taking me on , don &apos;t you think ?
i knew what i was risking when i didn &apos;t leave town ,
but i figured ...
you &apos;re not self destructive enough
to kill the sheriff &apos;s ex @-@ husband .
makes you the third person to underestimate me today .
you know ,
with all this behavioral modification going on around here ,
i almost forgot how good blood tastes
when it &apos;s ... fresh .
what are you going to do ?
kill everybody who discovers your secret ?
no , i &apos;m not going to kill you , bill .
daddy ! are you ok ?
i &apos;m fine .
here . it &apos;ll heal you .
i said i &apos;m ok .
grow up .
let me teach this ass @-@ wheel a life lesson .
just get out of here .
or what ?
i &apos;m stronger than you , little girl .
well , i &apos;m angrier !
bummer .
i love a good girl fight .
you can &apos;t do this anymore , damon .
not in this town .
not around me .
why not ?
it &apos;s nothing i haven &apos;t done before .
why is it suddenly so important
for everyone to keep me in check ?
because i don &apos;t want you
to be what other people think that you are .
what ? a monster ?
sorry to disappoint you , elena ,
but last time i checked , i was still a vampire !
i guess i wish that you didn &apos;t have to act like one !
i am not stefan .
how about you stop trying to turn me into him ?
hey , jeremy .
there &apos;s ashes everywhere .
i &apos;ll go grab the vacuum .
no , i got it .
are you ok ?
don &apos;t .
what ?
bonnie &apos;s here , ok ? you &apos;ve got to stop .
i was just trying to warn you .
i felt something bad . dangerous .
you--you just can &apos;t pop up
every time she and i are together .
it &apos;s a two @-@ way street , jeremy .
i only pop up when you &apos;re thinking about me .
that &apos;s why you haven &apos;t told her .
isn &apos;t it ?
you don &apos;t want her to know you still care .
i can &apos;t do this right now .
i can &apos;t . this is just too much .
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
good @-@ bye , anna .
don &apos;t ! jeremy , please .
don &apos;t shut me out .
what &apos;s wrong ?
you asked me before if something was wrong
and i said no .
yeah ?
that was a lie .
i was lying to you .
when you brought me back to life ...
say you can hear me , jeremy .
please !
something happened .
i am all alone !
you &apos;re back .
finally .
nik went to check on the witch .
dreary , isn &apos;t it ?
the family cargo .
why don &apos;t you undagger them ?
because he would hunt me down and kill me .
he &apos;s a vindictive little bastard , my brother .
but you still care about him . why ?
well , i hated him for a long time .
it was exhausting .
you know , when i met you two ,
you were both on the run .
also exhausting .
who were you running from ?
what do you mean ?
last night i saw you ,
there was a man looking for you .
you both seemed afraid .
i just--i wouldn &apos;t think klaus would be afraid of anybody .
no one in this world is truly fearless , stefan .
not even niklaus .
who was that man ?
i can &apos;t . please .
if nik knew we were talking about this , he would--
no , no , no , i &apos;m sorry .
just forget i asked .
ok ?
he told me about the girl you loved .
the one that died .
he also told me that you &apos;re only with him
because he saved your brother .
it &apos;s true .
i think he secretly admires that about you .
he &apos;d sacrifice anything for family .
don &apos;t tell him i told you that .
your secret ...
is safe with me .
do you think you &apos;ll ever love anyone
like you loved that girl ?
one day , maybe .
i can always tell when you &apos;re lying , stefan .
what ? i &apos;m not--
don &apos;t bother . your kiss already gave you away .
gloria &apos;s gone .
she &apos;s cleared out .
we need to find a new witch immediately .
what &apos;s going on ?
something &apos;s wrong . he was asking about michael .
he &apos;s not with us , nik . i can sense it .
she &apos;s wrong .
klaus ...
起床了
it took a bit longer than usual , huh ?
might want to get that ring checked .
hope it &apos;s not going bad .
you killed me .
you pissed me off .
you killed me !
ric , no hard feelings , all right ? i was on a bit of a tear .
everyone was trying to tell me how to behave .
well , maybe they finally realized you &apos;re just a dick .
i &apos;m not going to say i told you so .
thank you .
but i did tell you .
ok , you and damon were both right .
i was trying to change him .
but if he wants to be in my life--
wait . i--
it &apos;s been a long week ,
so i &apos;m just going to be blunt .
it doesn &apos;t matter what he does ,
damon &apos;s gotten under your skin .
that &apos;s not true .
god , just admit it , elena , ok ?
you are attracted to him !
in all of his bad brother glory .
no .
wait , no , you &apos;re not attracted to him ,
or no , you just won &apos;t admit it ?
i can &apos;t , caroline !
if i admit it ,
if i even thought it for just a second ...
what does that say about me ?
it says you &apos;re human , elena .
do you need me to ...
no , i got it .
don &apos;t worry ,
i &apos;m going to go back home before somebody kills me .
how &apos;s your ...
oh , healed . see ?
thank you .
for coming to my rescue .
you &apos;re welcome .
bye , caroline .
daddy .
i &apos;m going to be ok .
you &apos;re a vampire , sweetheart .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll ever be ok again .
i understand where you &apos;re coming from , but--
the gilbert family is a founding family ,
and they deserve to have a voice on the council .
i &apos;ve taken care of them ,
i should be that voice .
that &apos;s not the way it works , mr. saltzman .
oh , really ? well , then tell me how it does .
the council &apos;s job is to protect the people of this town .
now your daughter &apos;s a vampire and your son &apos;s a werewolf .
so who &apos;s looking after the actual people ?
some of them may be family or friends ,
but they are still supernatural .
they don &apos;t follow our rules or our laws ,
they look after themselves ,
and that &apos;s what we need to do .
i &apos;ll see you at the next meeting .
hey there . i just saw jeremy .
he said that you still have my necklace ?
yeah , i haven &apos;t figured out what &apos;s going on with it yet .
i know .
but i just-- i feel weird without it .
the whole stefan of it all .
did jeremy also tell you
that he &apos;s been seeing ghosts of his dead girlfriends all summer ?
what ?
vicki and anna . he &apos;s been talking to them .
you &apos;re kidding .
i wish .
it &apos;s because i brought him back to life .
the witches said there would be consequences .
guess they were right .
you know , what am i supposed to--
i &apos;ll accept written apologies only .
are you two lovebirds fighting already ?
katherine .
wonderful . what do you want ?
i &apos;m just a girl looking for a partner in crime .
feel like hitting the road ?
getting the hell out of dodge ?
impeccable timing .
i was told i need to take a beat .
is that a yes ?
i &apos;ll drive .
why not ?
walls are starting to close in on me around here .
where are we going ?
away from here . that &apos;s all i &apos;m going to give you for right now .
but believe me--
it &apos;s good .
just give me a chance to explain myself , ok ?
no need . i &apos;m not mad , i &apos;m just curious .
rebekah seems to think you &apos;re hold onto something .
a piece of your old life .
the thing is , she &apos;s got flawless instincts ;
borderline supernatural .
so i thought
i would check it out .
see for myself what it is you &apos;ve been hiding .
