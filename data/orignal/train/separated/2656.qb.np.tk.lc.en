the online recording implicates the united states
in the murder of a chinese official .
the recording appears to prove that zhang lau was poisoned
as part of a plot orchestrated by this man ,
state department official russell pritchard .
how -- how the hell did this happen ?
my face is all over the news .
well , you better get me out of beijing .
the chinese are looking for me .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before --
wait . please ! please !
that recording isn &apos;t real ! it &apos;s all some kind of frame @-@ up !
it was released by a man called the caretaker !
that &apos;s who you have to find ! the caretaker !
help ! help !

第78号
made you breakfast .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s supposed to be taking care of you .
come here for a minute .
you &apos;re feeling better .
much .
that &apos;s good .
what is this ?
yes .
yes ... what ?
yes , i want to marry you .
are you for real ?
yes .
i want to take care of you for the rest of our lives ,
for better and definitely for worse .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
maybe he &apos;ll be walking you down the aisle .
not if you &apos;re at the other end of it .
good point .
hey , i have a delivery for a tom keen
from safe stop pharmacy .
oh , i can get it .
oh , it &apos;s prescription medicine . i need a patient signature .
i @-@ i got it . it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m great .
rest .
i will .
you got everything ?
yep -- percocet for the pain
and a glock 26 for your pleasure .
how are you feeling ?
we &apos;ve decided to keep the baby .
we ?
i &apos;ve accepted tom &apos;s proposal .
we &apos;re gonna get married .
right .
i know how you feel about him .
i hope you &apos;ll keep an open mind .
are you aware that a gentleman in your state department
has been murdered in beijing ?
yes . fished out of the hai river .
his name was russell pritchard .
murdered by the chinese as payback
for the assassination of a chinese official , zhang lau .
how ?
with the help of addison wen ,
an extremely powerful chinese @-@ american businessman .
while zhang lau was in town visiting the u.n. ,
mr. wen invited him to a dinner party at his home .
that night , zhang lau is poisoned by agents
that mr. wen agreed to let the state department
place on his serving staff .
that agreement , it seems , was recorded by addison wen himself .
he knew once the murder was committed ,
he &apos;d be considered a loose end by your government .
he wanted insurance that the government wouldn &apos;t kill him .
precisely .
which brings us to our next blacklister .
they call him the caretaker , a secret keeper --
documents , recordings , photos .
the caretaker maintains an impenetrable safe @-@ deposit vault
for criminals , governments , captains of industry ,
and he only releases those secrets
according to one &apos;s specific instructions .
so , in addison wen &apos;s case ,
that recording was leverage .
he probably didn &apos;t want it released unless
he was murdered or arrested for the poisoning of zhang lau .
i agree .
and yet , my sources tell me addison wen is very much alive
and was in no danger of prosecution ,
which means something has gone terribly wrong .
the integrity of the caretaker &apos;s operation
is the only thing preventing thousands of
closely guarded secrets from being exposed ,
secrets that implicate powerful and dangerous people .
i &apos;m begging you .
i don &apos;t know who you are .
i &apos;ve done nothing to you . please .
please , you don &apos;t have to do this .
you can let me go . please !
if his system is failing , i assure you ,
russell pritchard &apos;s death is only the beginning .
according to reddington ,
the recording of pritchard and addison wen
is just one secret of thousands .
he says the caretaker has evidence of
murder , corruption , blackmail ,
and not just from governments --
from corporations , billionaires .
this is the kind of information people kill to acquire .
kill to keep secret .
he wants us to find the caretaker and contain the leaks .
why ? isn &apos;t it best for the truth to come out ?
that sounds a little naive .
all right , morality aside , let &apos;s just find this guy
and deal with whatever secrets he &apos;s keeping one at a time .
start with addison wen .
if he deposited a recording with the caretaker ,
maybe he knows what the hell is going on .
and we better get to him fast .
if he helped us kill zhang lau ,
the chinese are gonna want a word with him .
well , you don &apos;t seem very surprised to see me .
they say two things will survive a nuclear holocaust --
cockroaches and twinkies .
you &apos;re a little of both .
i &apos;ll make this easy for you .
and hard .
i &apos;m here to make you an offer .
mind if i change into some clothes before we negotiate ?
be my guest .
so , what &apos;s the offer ?
peace .
despite the fact that you shot me and left me for dead .
that &apos;s far enough .
damn it , woman .
why does it always have to be like this with you ?
i came here for peace .
peace is boring .
not if i have to put a hole in your head to get it .
and you come at me again , that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna do .
hello , jeanette .
tell us about the caretaker .
i was told he could keep a secret .
i was misinformed .
mr. wen , tell us everything you know about him ,
and maybe we won &apos;t give you to the chinese .
i &apos;m an american . you can &apos;t extradite me .
who said anything about extradition ?
tom and i are getting married .
that &apos;s great .
after everything you &apos;ve been through ,
i &apos;m happy you found your way back to each other .
i know from my own personal experience ...
that &apos;s not an easy thing to do .
i &apos;m so sorry about what &apos;s happening with you and charlene .
forget about that .
you &apos;re getting married !
it &apos;s crazy .
i just wish ...
despite everything she &apos;s put me through ,
i wish my mom could be there .
of course you do .
that &apos;s only natural .
i mean , everybody has something to say about her .
i just wish i knew the truth for myself , you know ?
and you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no one who can help you find it ?
i tracked down this one man -- anton velov .
he said he didn &apos;t know much ,
but i think he was holding something back .
sounds like you should pay this mr. velov a visit .
could be you didn &apos;t poison zhang lau ,
but the recording proves that you conspired to ,
so you &apos;ve got no play here except to start talking .
i don &apos;t have anything to say .
i don &apos;t know his name . we never met .
but you gave him the recording . how ?
i put it in the tubes .
tubes ?
what tubes ?
the u.s. post office initiated pneumatic tube service in 1893 .
soon , it had over 27 miles of tubes running beneath manhattan ,
brooklyn , and the bronx ,
and that is just the post office .
there were libraries , hospitals , department stores .
according to wen , the caretaker uses the system
to transport documents and other hard media .
which one of these tubes leads to this caretaker ?
there are hundreds of tubes and thousands of terminal points .
it &apos;s a potential superhighway to transport drugs ,
cash , contraband right under our noses .
there is no way to untangle it .
i know someone who can .
who ?
he &apos;s quite an eccentric , a recluse .
but i &apos;m a faithful client ,
and he &apos;s agreed to meet with us .
there is one thing that i can &apos;t seem to ...
wrap my head around .
what ?
tom .
after all the lies , all the deception and humiliation ,
how you can just forgive and forget .
i haven &apos;t forgotten .
forgiveness can &apos;t change the past ,
but i believe it can change the future .
that &apos;s a charming sentiment .
but as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
some things are unforgivable .
shall we ?
he &apos;s here ?
he &apos;s approximately 60 feet beneath our feet .
he calls himself hugo . he &apos;s a hobbyist of sorts .
spent 20 years meticulously restoring
and expanding the old b.r.t. pneumatic tube system .
so it &apos;s true . it really exists .
oh , yes . fully functional and wonderfully reliable .
hugo runs it as a private service to a specialized clientele .
i &apos;ve been a client since his early days ,
and i &apos;m wagering the caretaker is , as well .
try not to stare .
hugo !
i see you &apos;re busy as ever .
raymond ?
you didn &apos;t say you were bringing persons .
well , you know dembe .
and this is former fbi agent elizabeth keen .
fbi ?
they employ me as a consultant .
he employs me as an inside source .
and in that capacity ,
she has alerted me to a troubling development ...
... and may have grave repercussions
for many of your clients and , well , you .
me ?
i need you to give me the location
for one of those clients -- the caretaker .
i can &apos;t violate a client &apos;s privacy .
that -- that &apos;d be a violation .
normally , i would agree .
but the caretaker &apos;s system has been compromised ,
and the f.b.i. are looking for him .
they will find him .
and then ...
they &apos;ll find me .
no doubt .
but if you can give us his location ,
ms. keen will steer the bureau away from you ,
guaranteeing you will not be imprisoned .
now , wouldn &apos;t that be nice ?
hello , jeanette .
i want out .
gina , i never thought i would ,
but i do .
we don &apos;t save people , gina .
we watch them drown .
and i &apos;m tired of hurting people .
i want to start pulling people up
instead of holding them down .
and i can &apos;t think of a better place to start
than right here with you .
so ...
i could end this right now .
i could go find the major , and i could end him , too .
or ...
we can just agree to just walk away .
i don &apos;t come after you ,
and you don &apos;t come after me or my family .
i should have said yes
that night in budapest .
no , gina . listen to me .
i &apos;m asking you to help me walk away .
please .
someday , maybe someone will do the same thing for you .
i &apos;ll try .
♬ up from the grave he arose ♬
♬ with mighty triumph o &apos;er his foes ♬
according to reddington , one of the pneumatic tube lines
leads to the basement of the caretaker &apos;s house .
in what world does that make any sense ?
only in reddington &apos;s .
the house should be just around this corner .
hold up . what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a little late for a burial .
♬ he arose the victor of his dark domain ♬
♬ and lives forever with his saints to reign ♬
♬ up from the grave he arose ♬
♬ with a mighty ... ♬
drop the knife .
drop the knife ! hands where we can see them !
now we know where he keeps his secrets .
the video that was released -- a man died because of it .
we &apos;re told other people will die
when other secrets are released .
is this a deliberate leak or negligence --
a flaw in your security ?
who penetrated your system ?
no one .
the system is perfect .
i released the video .
i &apos;m begging you .
i &apos;ve done nothing to you . please .
please , you don &apos;t have to do this .
you can let me go . please !
please ! you don &apos;t have to ...
you have 24 hours to release ledger item number 2156 ...
luftreiber airlines and the german government .
please , daddy !
just do what they say !
they kidnapped my daughter .
for three generations ,
my family has guarded the secrets of presidents ,
corporations , criminals .
the traditions , the pride of my fathers
is nothing compared to the love i hold for rose .
she &apos;s all i have .
they know that .
who ?
who are they ?
they took her and the ledger .
they have the names of my clients
and the locations of the secrets i keep for them .
they &apos;ve ordered me to betray a second secret by midnight ...
or rose will die .
we can help you .
we will do everything we can to help find rose ,
but we can &apos;t do that without knowing the secret
the kidnappers wanted to know .
you confiscated it already from the grave ...
the canister .
luftreiber air ? what secret of theirs is he keeping ?
a copy of a contract between an airline
and the german government .
100 million euros up front ,
50 million euros for every year thereafter ...
&quot; for services rendered . &quot;
it &apos;s dated march 4 , 2007 .
i got a hit .
april 12 , 2007 .
an a318 airbus operated by luftreiber
crashed just after takeoff at tripoli international .
that was back in march .
all 107 passengers and 6 crew dead .
that &apos;s when airline officials announced
the crash was due to an avionic malfunction .
all very cut @-@ and @-@ dry .
unless the rumors were true .
a terrorist attack .
then why would the airline assume liability ?
perhaps to shift blame from another institution ,
one with an even great responsibility
for the safety of german citizens .
the german government ?
you &apos;re suggesting that the terrorists
warned the government beforehand .
and they failed to alert the airline to the threat .
luftreiber claims responsibility ,
shielding the bureaucrats from a scandal
in exchange for remuneration
for the inevitable blizzard of lawsuits .
one hand washes the other .
so , the airline places the contract in escrow
with the caretaker as leverage against exposure .
have you got any leads on who abducted his daughter ?
she was last seen at her office three days ago .
ressler &apos;s there right now reviewing the security video .
forward me anything he finds .
but under no circumstances
can that contract become public knowledge .
if we do nothing ,
rose janus will die at midnight .
we still have two hours .
very well . make every minute count .
but if you fail , i warn you ,
do not expose the germans .
anton .
your guest is here .
thank you , darla .
thank you for meeting with me , mr. velov .
about a year ago , i came to visit you in your restaurant .
i remember .
you were asking about katarina rostova .
that &apos;s right .
i was hoping you could answer a few more questions for me .
she was just a name .
one of many i heard when i was with spetsnaz .
beyond that , i know nothing .
please .
she was my mother .
dear , i cannot help you .
i would if i could , believe me .
i , too , have daughter .
the life i led , the things i had to do ,
she won &apos;t talk to me .
i try to explain , but there are some ...
some things which can never be forgiven .
i &apos;m sorry , um ... why did you agree
to meet with me if you can &apos;t help me ?
my daughter .
i don &apos;t know where she is .
i am dying .
i have written her this letter .
you are with fbi , no ?
you can find her .
give it to her .
please .
it explains everything .
he told her nothing .
you &apos;re certain ?
he spent most of the time talking about his own daughter .
thank you , darla .
she deserves the truth .
watch the road , dembe .
that &apos;s rose janus .
and this is the license plate of the kidnapper &apos;s van .
run it . find it .
we &apos;ve got 90 minutes before they execute her .
that &apos;s not enough time .
we have to release the luftreiber contract .
germany is one of our closest allies .
i mean , you really want to embarrass them like that ?
yes . and you should , too .
they were warned by terrorists , did nothing ,
and covered it up .
if reddington &apos;s theory is true .
but the contract is for services rendered .
there was no mention of terrorism or the crash .
i mean , the date is circumstantial .
we have no hard evidence --
but a hell of a smoking gun .
nothing on the van .
it &apos;s a late @-@ model chevy express .
there are thousands registered in the tri @-@ state area .
and the plates were stolen from a honda accord
on the day of the abduction .
do it . leak the contract .
that &apos;s a mistake .
you &apos;re right .
it will embarrass germany ,
and it could damage diplomatic relations .
no one will be killed because of that .
if we do nothing , rose janus will die .
the kidnapper &apos;s instructions --
we know what they are .
follow them .
to the letter .
what is it ? what do you see ?
what you said about forgiveness changing the future --
it comforts me to know you &apos;re looking forward again .
the future holds such promise .
the past -- so many regrets .
the van is lined with chobham ballistic armor .
virtually impregnable , heat resistant ,
most often deployed in tanks and apcs .
so it &apos;s military .
it &apos;s an after @-@ market job -- very specialized .
only a few custom shops have the equipment necessary
to install it .
i can &apos;t say which one , but i know someone who can .
semo !
how you doing , sole ? !
you still got that sweet gto ?
oh , sadly no .
i gave it to a north korean general
in exchange for a young woman &apos;s freedom .
ooh . i know a lot of women .
i &apos;d have kept the goat .
as i recall , you &apos;ve always carried a torch for oldsmobiles .
i have a line on a low @-@ mileage , pristine 1970.442
with a factory w @-@ 30 package .
i can put you in touch in exchange for a small favor .
you interested ?
what do you think ?
cynthia panabaker . i drew the short straw .
harold cooper .
you have any idea how much this place spooks main justice ?
reven wright and diane fowler were good people .
they were patriots assigned to oversee this task force
and now they are missing and presumed dead .
no one wants to know what happened to them more than i.
i have no interest in
disappearing or dying in the foreseeable future ,
so i will watch your back and you will watch mine .
are we clear ?
your assistant said you had
a matter of some urgency to discuss .
we have a major national security breach .
anybody with a tree to shake has been ordered to shake it ,
see if anything falls out .
this is the reddington tree .
how can we help ?
two known terrorists
penetrated the port of tampa 14 hours ago .
german bnd had them hard on the radar ,
and we lost them .
the terrorists ?
no , the germans .
seems someone leaked some documents
implicating them in some kind of cover @-@ up ,
and they think it was us .
why would they suspect --
i don &apos;t know . they &apos;re germans .
now , they may end up sharing their intel ,
but for right now , they &apos;re pissed ,
and we can &apos;t afford to wait till they calm down ,
so find out what reddington knows .
before anything blows up would be nice .
cooper .
the gunmen who took rose janus --
i &apos;ve got an address .
how ?
reddington spotted some custom work on their van ,
traced it to a chop shop .
we got a physical address on the customer .
i want that address .
then i want you back here with reddington .
why ? what happened ?
i just got paid a visit by the white house counsel .
we have bigger problems than saving the caretaker &apos;s daughter .
two known terrorists penetrated the border
through the port of tampa .
two hours ago , a cargo truck was stolen
from a shipping company near the port ,
and whoever took it was smart enough
to disable its satellite tracker .
and the white house is asking for reddington &apos;s help ?
at this point , i think they &apos;ll take help from anybody .
the german bnd captured chatter indicating
that an attack on a major domestic target is imminent .
according to their intel ,
the terrorists have access to a metric ton of c @-@ 4,
which was stolen from a mexican armory .
the germans were tracking it , but ...
what ?
oh , my god .
you released the luftreiber contract ,
and now the germans are refusing to cooperate .
i did it to save a woman &apos;s life .
and now many more may die .
i don &apos;t mean to gloat , but boy , did i tell you so .
you know everything there is to know about port security .
yes , but this isn &apos;t about port security .
it &apos;s about cargo theft in florida .
luckily for you , harold , i poke my thumb in many pies .
this one is particularly profitable ,
so i &apos;ve associated myself with some of the players .
can your associates find the truck ?
their methods are breathtakingly simple --
place their own tracking devices on cargo containers ,
track them out of the port ,
and attack them when they &apos;re most vulnerable .
yes , they can help find your truck .
the question is -- why on earth they would want to .
because it &apos;s their patriotic duty .
they &apos;re mexicans .
get them to help , and i &apos;ll owe you .
yes , you will .
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
come on !
fbi !
go ! go !
get on your knees . put your hands behind your head .
donald ressler , fbi . everything &apos;s okay .
are you all right ?
is this your father &apos;s ledger ?
okay , come with me .
justin van zandt . usmc .
served with distinction in afghanistan --
a bronze star and a purple heart .
and now kidnapping .
why ?
i want a lawyer .
habeas corpus isn &apos;t on the menu today ,
not when we &apos;re dealing with matters of national security .
so , who do you work for ?
the men who took you were former marines .
did you know that ?
no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t .
nothing in their file suggests that the men who took you
had the ability to penetrate your father &apos;s operation .
do you have any idea who they might be working for ?
someone they met overseas ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help you .
rose , if we can &apos;t find the person responsible
for taking you , we cannot guarantee your safety .
does my father know you found me ?
yes .
he &apos;s on his way here right now .
come on , van zandt .
we know you and your partner were just the muscle .
who hired you ?
we know how close the two of you were .
what we don &apos;t know is why you &apos;re protecting the man
responsible for his death .
you shot him .
yeah .
i &apos;m angry about that .
i &apos;m angry that somebody turned a war hero into a kidnapper ,
put him into a position where i had to shoot him .
i &apos;m angry at his friend for not giving up
the son of a bitch that made that happen .
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
why don &apos;t you tell us what was supposed to happen ?
i told him we didn &apos;t need guns .
he thought it would help sell it .
help sell what ?
that we were trying to hurt her ,
when all we were trying to do was help her .
help who ?
rose .
she &apos;s my sister .
look , i &apos;m grateful you guys found me ,
but i &apos;m starting to feel
a little bit like a suspect here .
how fitting .
your brother came clean .
you want to explain why you kidnapped yourself ?
keen located the cargo truck .
it &apos;s headed for new york city . you need to roll out now .
okay , we are go . i @-@ 95 is shut down ,
and the target is approaching our detour .
yes . he &apos;s taking the off @-@ ramp .
we &apos;re in front . we got a clean visual .
two targets in the cab .
what should i call you --
my idiot boyfriend or my idiot husband ?
you can &apos;t stay angry at me forever .
watch me .
i told you take it in .
i told you that we needed a new car !
all you had to do was take it into the shop !
i &apos;m sorry . excuse me . could you help us ?
货物运输
my husband is a complete idiot .
freeze .
don &apos;t move !
targets are down .
cover !
nice job . almost like being a bitch comes naturally .
aram , are you there ?
uh , yeah . hearing every word .
货物运输
get these vehicles out of here .
sir , we have a serious situation .
we got a problem .
headquarters , expedite the bomb squad .
we &apos;re gonna need a perimeter set up ,
evacuation around our location .
oh , no . this is no good .
what ? what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
the bomb has been activated .
we have less than two minutes .
um , okay , well , uh , i &apos;m told the bomb squad
won &apos;t be there for 12 .
aram , i &apos;m sending you a photo of the component parts now .
two minutes isn &apos;t nearly enough time to evacuate .
we &apos;re not going to evacuate .
we &apos;re gonna disarm this thing ,
and we need you to walk us through it .
we are looking at a timed detonator ,
about 20 barrels of accelerant --
ammonium nitrate and fuel oil .
we got about a minute and 45 seconds left .
uh , okay . that &apos;s not helping .
all right , there are four batteries .
we need to disable all four .
okay , first i need you to cut the green wire
that leads to the switch on the bottom .
but just make sure you don &apos;t disturb the mercury .
okay , got it .
all right , trace the wires from the timing device and cut the ...
okay , cut the orange and white ones .
orange and white .
done . next ?
all right , there is one last battery
connected to the green control box on the top left .
cut the wrong wire in the wrong sequence
and the bomb detonates .
all right , there are two wires there -- blue and red .
so , here &apos;s what you do .
apologize to agent navabi .
what ?
aram , we don &apos;t have time for this .
we have 30 seconds .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; takes less than one . 28 seconds .
look , i &apos;m not sorry for firing her .
you called her the &quot; b &quot; word .
i didn &apos;t call her a bitch .
actually , you did .
okay , whatever .
i &apos;m real sorry for calling agent navabi a bitch .
blue .
blue . cut the blue wire .
apology accepted .
is she okay ?
she &apos;s alive and safe .
but no , she &apos;s not okay .
what do you mean ?
let me see her .
what did they do to her ?
nothing .
she kidnapped herself to get away from you .
she knows what you did , mr. janus .
she &apos;s known for months .
imagine how she felt finding herself
on a missing children &apos;s website .
her real name is jessica van zandt .
did you know ?
did you ever bother to find out who she was ?
my wife and unborn child
died a few months before .
i was out for a drive ,
and i saw her crossing the street .
she tripped .
her father .
her father -- mean . drunk .
he started beating on her .
i got out , went over to him to explain ,
&quot; she &apos;s just a little girl . &quot;
a beautiful little girl .
words were exchanged .
he took a swing at me .
i moved in in self @-@ defense .
he went down ...
hard .
as he lay there bleeding , i felt a little hand in mine .
she just took it .
like she was saying , &quot; thank you . &quot;
we walked back to the car .
she got in willingly .
and we left .
left .
you took her ... like a thief .
and by the time she realized what you &apos;d done ,
sought out her real family ,
the only one left was her brother -- a marine .
a marine .
protecting his country
in an effort to atone for failing to protect his sister .
he wanted to go to the police , turn you in .
but she had other plans .
if she &apos;s released that ledger ,
she &apos;s caused more damage than she knows .
oh , i think rose knows exactly what she &apos;s done .
for generations , you and your ancestors
kept other people &apos;s secrets .
but it was your secret -- her -- that put an end to it all .
yes .
irina velov ?
yes .
this is for you .
it &apos;s from your father .
he told me you &apos;re estranged .
and my name is elizabeth , by the way .
he couldn &apos;t find you , so ...
anyway , he says it explains everything .
yes , it does .
for you .
me ?
i don &apos;t understand .
my father and i aren &apos;t estranged .
we talk every day . he told me you &apos;d be coming .
he didn &apos;t write that letter to me .
he wrote it to you .
i &apos;m curious , harold .
how do you think the white house is going to express
their appreciation to me for foiling the terrorist plot ?
maybe an embossed ashtray .
or one of those little american flag pins for my lapel .
i think the best you can hope for is tolerance .
i &apos;m here to call in your chit .
excuse me ?
nobody uses the word &quot; chit &quot; anymore , do they ?
rhyming with a vulgarity didn &apos;t do it any favors .
a chit is --
it &apos;s a note for a debt incurred .
all those lives at risk , and you only helped
in order to force it down my throat .
what do you want ?
the caretaker &apos;s ledger . i &apos;d like to borrow it .
if it were up to me , i &apos;d burn it .
i &apos;ve learned the hard way
that some secrets are best kept in the dark .
mine certainly is .
if you insist on sleeping in the office ,
i might suggest you forego the floor
and get yourself a futon .
your chiropractor will thank you .
how did you know ?
harold , forgive charlene .
a friend told me recently
that forgiveness won &apos;t change the past
but could very well change the future .
apparently , nothing is unforgivable .
go home , harold .
my mother &apos;s alive . you lied to me .
velov is the one who lied to you , lizzy , not me .
katarina rostova committed suicide in 1990 .
velov was the agent assigned to find her .
he was getting close , she knew it .
that &apos;s why she allegedly walked into the ocean .
she wanted the world to believe she drowned .
but velov knows differently .
he tracked her to a hotel in prague .
she had just left .
but in such a hurry , she missed this ...
a photo of her little girl .
me .
that could easily have been planted .
you said the name masha rostova
had been lost to history until the manhunt .
now it &apos;s out there , and someone &apos;s looking for me .
it &apos;s my mother .
who else would care ?
who ?
you were right .
some things can &apos;t be forgiven .
♬ all the plans ♬
♬ that were made ♬
how was your day ?
it was , uh , busy .
♬ let them die ♬
spent it telling anyone who &apos;d listen how much i love you .
♬ let them fade ♬
♬ i &apos;ll spend the day ♬
♬ in my own way ♬
it &apos;s me .
he came .
just like you said he would .
♬ please understand ♬
how do you want me to handle it ?
♬ i &apos;m only human ♬
this is above and beyond , my friend .
above and beyond .
is that it ?
♬ after all is said and done ♬
if anything happened to me , this was to go to elizabeth .
so she would know .
♬ only here a moment ♬
♬ and the moment &apos;s gone ♬
now i &apos;m not sure i ever want her to know .
perhaps , raymond , in this case ,
what you want is irrelevant .
♬ i &apos;ll spend the day ♬
if the universe wants her to know , she will find a way .
