第二十一集
You tried to take away someone that I love,
and now I am taking back my son.
Maybe this will make you believe.
Why is it so important to you that I do?
Because everyone needs you.
Snow! I will find you!
I will always find you!
King George took James. I have to get him back.
You can't do it alone.
Let's show that king what Snow White
and seven dwarves can really do!
Do you want to come and live with me?
More than anything.
Then buckle up. We're leaving Storybrooke.
I don't recall us expecting any company.
Sheriff Swan.
What are you doing here?
Henry invited me.
Do you honestly believe I'd allow you into my house
for dinner after all the threats you made to my family?
I didn't come for dinner.
Then what did you come for?
You.
We all did.
Henry.
No. No. Let me go.
I command it!
After everything you've done to all of us?!
My apologies, Your Majesty, but my conscience is clear!
You're not queen anymore, sister!
Tighter!
She needs to feel our pain!
You took our love and ripped it apart!
And now you're gonna pay!
Rotten to the core.
I just wanted to win...
for once.
You took away our happiness,
and now it's our turn to take away yours.
What? What?
Henry.
Henry, please don't let them do this to me.
You did this to yourself.
Is that all your stuff?
All I need.
Wait. You wanna go now?
We're leaving now?
I'm getting you out of here,
away from all this, away from her.
No. No. Stop the car.
You can't leave Storybrooke. You have to break the curse.
No, I don't. I have to help you.
But you're a hero. You can't run.
You have to help everybody.
Henry, I know it's hard for you to see it,
but I'm doing what's best for you.
That's what you wanted when you brought me to Storybrooke.
But the curse--
You're the only chance to bring back the happy endings.
Henry.
Henry!
Henry.
What were you doing?! You could've gotten us killed!
Please! Please don't make me go!
We can't go!
Everything's here...
me, your parents, your family.
Please, Emma. They need you.
Your family needs you.
Did you really think that I would let you get away?
You appear to have had quite the adventure since then.
Whatever it is you're gonna do to me,
get on with it.
I took you in as my son,
and you betrayed me.
I would've given you everything--
the crown, the kingdom.
All you had to do was marry King Midas' daughter.
But you decided to follow "true love."
Losing my life for love--
that's a sacrifice I am happy to make.
As you wish.
Release the blade.
What is the meaning of this?
Sorry to drop in on you.
Regina.
What do you want?
I want the man you pretend is your son,
and I'm prepared to pay any riches Midas promised you
in return for him.
What do you plan to do to him?
Oh, I promise he'll suffer...
far more than some swift and simple beheading.
How?
By using him
to destroy his one true love.
By using him to bring an end to Snow White.
Your majesty. To what do I owe the pleasure?
My tree is dying.
Why?
Perhaps it's your fertilizer.
You think this is funny?
Well, I'll tell you what I think.
I think it's a sign of the curse weakening
because of Emma.
But do you care?
No.
You're content to just sit back and do...
whatever it is you're doing
while all my hard work burns.
That's not all, is it?
Come on. You might as well get everything off your chest.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Henry.
Ms. Swan wants him.
She'll have that boy over my dead body.
The curse was meant to
take away Snow White and Prince Charming's happiness.
Perhaps you giving up Henry is
just the price to keep the curse unbroken.
I think I'd rather just get rid of her.
You're gonna have to be quite creative.
We both know the repercussions in killing Ms. Swan.
The curse will be broken.
The curse will be broken.
That's because you designed it that way.
Undo it.
You know...
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.
Magic...
is in short supply around here
and dwindling by the minute.
You want the curse broken.
Why?
That's not something I care to discuss.
Don't bother. You can shove your reasons.
I want to strike a new deal.
One where I can get rid of Emma without shattering the curse.
Unfortunately for you,
a negotiation requires two interested parties,
and I'm already planning a trip.
I'll give you anything.
You no longer have anything I want, dearie.
But I will give you a piece of advice, free of charge--
I'd plan a trip of your own,
because once people waken up
and remember who you are
and what you did to them?
They are gonna be looking for blood.
佩奇
Thought you'd left.
Mary Margaret--
But I couldn't tell for sure
because you didn't bother to say good-bye.
Do you remember when I left?
When I ran? What you said to me?
You said, we have to stick together,
that we're like...
family.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left.
You're right. You shouldn't have.
So why, after everything, did you just go?
I don't wanna be sheriff. I don't want people relying on me.
I don't want this, any of it.
What about Henry?
I took him with me.
You abducted him?
Maybe.
So you don't want people to rely on you,
but you took your son?
Now that sounds like a stable home for him.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I want what's best for him.
And running is what's best for him?
Or is that what's best for you?
You're reverting, Emma,
into the person you were before you got here,
and I thought you'd changed.
You thought wrong.
Well, regardless,
you have to do what's right for Henry now.
What's that?
Oh, I don't know.
You're his mother.
That's your job.
So you figure it out.
If we're going to get him out,
we're going to have to get over that wall.
There's a soldier on every parapet.
We're gonna need some air support.
Air? I know just the person who can help us,
someone who owes me a favor.
Don't shoot. It's only me.
Uh, Red, you know, you got someone on your chin.
Sorry.
What were you able to find out?
Your prince is still alive.
Then why don't you look happy?
Because I also heard word the queen is here.
She knew I'd come for him.
It's a trap.
Indeed. It matters not.
I can't stop now.
But I'll understand if any of you want to turn back.
No!
Not a chance!
Oh. Well, then there's no time to waste.
Why is the queen doing this?
I destroyed her happiness,
and now she wants to destroy mine.
Leave us.
What do you want?
I suppose I see the allure.
I wonder if you'll be quite so incorruptible
after your precious Snow is gone.
Whatever she did to you,
leave her alone and take my life instead.
Oh, who said anything about taking her life?
Oh, no.
I have a far more satisfying brand of punishment for her.
Jefferson.
So you got my message.
How could I miss it?
You know I watch her.
It must be so painful,
your daughter Paige being oh, so near.
Grace. Her name is Grace.
You should know that. You changed it.
What do you want?
Your help.
And what makes you think
I won't kill you after everything you've done?
Because you don't have it in you.
If you did, you would have done it 28 years ago,
when I brought you here.
Because you know if I'm dead,
you'll never get back to your daughter.
And I have a way for us to both get what we want.
My hat.
I want you to use it again.
I can't make it work.
No one can.
Not here. Not without magic.
Well, then you're in luck, because I happen to have some.
Not a lot...
But hopefully, enough...
for one last journey.
Where?
Back to our land,
where there's a solution to a very delicate problem I have--
how to get rid of the one person who could break my curse.
Emma.
And why shouldn't I let her do just that?
End the madness and go home.
To your hovel?
Selling fungus at the fair?
Why?
When you could just stay here in the mansion I gave you?
My problem, Jefferson,
is the same as yours.
It's family.
We both want our children back,
and we both can get them,
if we work together.
Why should I trust you now?
You shouldn't.
But it's the only offer you've got.
After we're through, I'll wake up your dear Grace
so she remembers who you are.
No.
Remembering is the worst curse--
two lives in her head, like me.
I want to forget.
I want you to write us a new story,
a fresh start,
here.
Well, my dear Jefferson, then that's exactly what you'll have.
After we take care of Ms. Swan.
Thank you, Red.
Do it.
Move out.
I miss Stealthy.
We're a go!
Fairies! Attack!
Let's go!
Hang on.
August, please, I need your help.
Emma wants to leave.
What? Slow down.
You were gonna make her believe. You have to.
I know, Henry.
I'm sorry. I...
I failed.
Failed?
I tried to show her.
At first it was my legs,
and now...
Now take a look...
at the unvarnished truth.
It's wood.
Yes.
All of this...
I was right. The curse--it's real!
You're a smart kid.
And you're Pinocchio.
What gave it away?
But why are you turning back to wood?
Your story--
You should be real.
I'm changing back because...
I haven't exactly been a good boy.
And...
well...
If the curse doesn't break,
this doesn't stop.
So we show Emma that you're turning back
into the puppet you were, and then she has to believe,
And when she does, she could break the curse.
I tried that.
She doesn't want to see, so she doesn't.
There's nothing more that I can do.
I-I'm getting tired.
It's hard to ride and it's hard to walk.
Soon it's gonna be hard to breathe.
So we have to do something fast.
But there's nothing to do.
And with what little time I have left,
I want to spend it with my father.
Marco.
Told you you're a smart kid.
So everyone's giving up.
I'm afraid that I don't have a choice.
I'm sorry, kid, but I'm out of Operation Cobra.
Now it's up to you.
Emma, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid you don't have any case for custody.
Even after everything she's done?
Which you can't prove.
Let me just ask you a question.
With this war raging on, who really is getting hurt here?
I know. Henry.
But isn't it a good thing that he's spending time with me?
I'm his mother.
Yes, you are,
And so is Regina.
And l-look, the court is gonna come in and look at him
and see how he's been since you've come into his life.
And he's been happier, right?
Maybe. I mean, objectively?
He's skipped school, he's stolen a credit card,
he's run off, he's--he's endangered himself,
repeatedly.
And so in the eyes of the law, it's not so--
What about in your eyes? What do you think?
I mean, a while ago, I told you to engage him
in his fantasy life, and-and perhaps I was wrong,
because he's only retreated further into it.
You think he's better off with her?
I never said that.
Do you think that she would ever hurt him?
No.
Never.
I mean, everyone else, but not him.
Look, right or wrong, her actions have all been defensive.
I'm not judging, but...
In many ways, your arrival has woke a sleeping dragon.
Tell me honestly.
Has he been better off since I got here?
It's not a matter of better off.
It's--it's a matter of this war has to end.
If you two are gonna be in his life,
you have to figure out the best way to do that.
Charming.
Charming.
Snow.
You're...
No.
No.
Oh, no!
The queen took me to her palace.
But I'm rescuing you.
Snow.
Is this always gonna be our life?
Taking turns finding each other?
We'll be together. I know it.
Have faith.
I just had to stop you.
I have no interest in cleaning tongue marks off my mirror.
Let him go.
Your fight is with me.
My thoughts exactly.
Have you ever heard of a parley?
We break off all this messy fighting and have a little talk,
just you and me.
Come unarmed.
Where do I meet you?
Where it all began.
Stop trying to talk me out of this.
The castle is secure. I'm going.
Keep the little knife between your tuffets.
I promised I would come alone and unarmed.
It's a parley. There are rules.
You're too noble for your own good.
I'm not, but enough of you have risked your lives
because of something that's between the queen and me.
I will not let anyone else get hurt because of me.
Except you.
Thank you for your concern, but this ends today.
We can't let you go.
I'm not asking.
Thank you for your support.
I love each and every one of you,
but this is something I have to do...
Alone.
I don't like this.
I don't trust that queen.
Watch your step.
What is this place?
Where I've kept the last bit of my magic.
The only magic in this world
is in the things I brought with me.
It's not spinning.
It's not working.
It needs to absorb the magic that's here.
I have some things left,
a few trinkets.
It's not enough. You need something that still works.
Who's that?
Someone long gone.
Well, whatever or whoever it is,
it still has magical properties.
Give me that, and let me see what I can do with it.
If you want your son back,
if you want your revenge, give it to me.
What's wrong?
Why isn't it opening a portal?
The magic--it's not enough.
We can't go anywhere.
Then you've failed.
Maybe not.
There's enough magic to touch the other side,
just not to get us there.
There might be enough to...
reach through and retrieve something.
I can bring something back?
Is there an object that can help you?
Perhaps I can open it enough and reach through and grab it.
It would have to be small,
something that you can take with your hand.
Is there anything like that that can help you?
Yes.
Yes, I believe there is.
Then you need to direct me to the time and place
where this object exists.
How?
Think about it.
Guide the hat.
Excellent.
It appears to be working.
Now what is it we're after?
An apple.
Hello, Regina.
Follow me.
Do you remember when I ran down your runaway horse, Snow?
Do you remember when I saved your life?
Of course.
It all looks the same.
Not quite.
This is new.
Is that...
A grave.
Daniel's grave.
Daniel? I thought--
He ran away?
I told you that
to spare your feelings out of... Kindness,
but he died because of you.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too,
but nothing can change what happened,
what you did.
You promised to keep my secret.
You promised, but you lied.
I was very young, and your mother--
She ripped his heart out because of you,
because you couldn't listen to me!
You took my father.
Haven't we both suffered enough?
No.
What is that?
It's just a morsel.
Did you know that apples stand for health and wisdom?
So why do I get the feeling that one might kill me?
It won't kill you.
No, what it will do is far worse.
Your body will be your tomb, and you'll be in there
with nothing but dreams formed of your own regrets.
And you're going to force me to eat it.
No.
Of course not.
It wouldn't work anyway.
The choice is yours.
It must be taken willingly.
And why would I do that?
Because if you refuse the apple,
your prince, your charming
will be killed.
No.
As I said, the choice is yours.
I take that apple, and he lives?
That's the deal you want to make?
With all my heart.
Then congratulations.
You've won.
Snow.
What have you done to her?!
What have you done?!
Snow!
Is this it?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
And my daughter, my Grace?
First things first.
The deal's not done,
not until I solve the next conundrum--
How to get this savior
to taste my forbidden fruit.
We need to talk.
Yes, I imagine we do.
I was just about to call you, too.
Come right in.
Do what you're so skilled at and make yourself at home.
I believe you came to see me.
Right. Look, this isn't easy.
I think that this...
Whatever is between us needs to end.
At last, something we can agree on.
I want to make a deal with you about Henry.
I'm not making any deals with you.
I'm leaving town.
What?
This...
What we're doing is a problem,
and I'm gonna go, but I have conditions.
I still get to see Henry. I get to visit
and spend time, whatever.
And you get to see him. You're still in his life.
Look, in any deal, both parties are a little unhappy.
But let's be honest.
We both know
the world where I'm not in his life no longer exists,
and there's no one who can do anything about that.
You're right.
Would you mind following me for a moment?
So what are you proposing?
I don't know.
Just figure it out as we go.
But he's my son.
Yeah.
Oh, Ms. Swan?
Maybe a little something for the road?
Thanks.
If we're going to be in each other's lives,
it's time we start being cordial.
My famous turnovers.
Old recipe.
But delicious.
Thank you.
I do hope you like apples.
Snow was here. I can smell it.
Snow! Snow!
she's over here!
I found her lying here like this. Is she--
Granny, give me your dagger.
Maybe she's just sleeping.
She has no breath.
She's gone.
She sacrificed herself for true love.
She sacrificed herself for all of us.
It would appear sacrifice is overrated.
Speaking of...
Snow!
What have you done to her?!
What have you done?!
I hope you bought travel insurance,
because no one's going anywhere.
Oh, really?
And why's that?
Because I found a solution to my Emma Swan problem.
Oh, yes?
An old reliable solution.
A sleeping curse.
Might I ask how you managed to obtain one here in Storybrooke?
By sacrificing the last bit of magic I had left.
So you made magic from magic.
Well, I'm sure I don't have to remind you that,
all magic comes with a price.
Then you can pay it.
Because now...
The curse is gonna be stronger than ever,
and you will be right here where you belong.
Don't you understand?
I won.
So whatever plan you had...
Whatever reason you wanted the curse broken?
Too bad.
Because it's never going to happen.
Hey, Emma. Everything okay?
You sounded strange over the walkie.
No, I'm okay.
Just, um...
Yesterday when I tried to take you away,
you were right.
I can't take you out of Storybrooke.
But I can't stay either.
What?
I have to go.
Go? You mean leave Storybrooke?
Yeah. I spoke to Regina, and we made a deal.
I'm still gonna be able to see you, just not...
every day.
No! No, you can't trust her.
I have to. It's my only choice.
It's what's best for you, Henry.
Every time I fight her, someone else gets hurt.
No, no, no!
You're just scared.
This happens to all heroes.
It's just the low moment before you fight back.
Henry! This isn't a story.
This is reality.
And things have to change.
You can't skip school.
You can't run away, and...
You can't believe in curses.
Y-you really don't believe?
I...
This is how it has to be right now.
I made a deal,
and I used my super power. She's telling the truth.
She's gonna take really good care of you.
Yes, but she wants you dead.
Come on, Henry!
You're the only one that can stop her.
Stop her from what?
All she's ever done is fight for you.
This just...
got out of hand.
I'm sorry.
Where did you get that?
Regina gave it to me.
Apple!
So?
You can't eat that. It's poison.
What?
Don't you see?
The deal--it was all a trick to get you to eat that,
to get rid of the savior.
Henry, come on. Why would she do that
when I just told her I was gonna go?
Because as long as you're alive, you're a threat to the curse.
Henry, you've gotta stop thinking like this.
But it's the truth!
And you leaving isn't gonna change that.
I'll prove it to you.
No!
Henry... What are you doing?
I'm sorry it had to come to this.
You may not believe in the curse... Or in me.
But I believe in you.
See? You wanna have some ice cream with that?
And then we can go back to talking about...
Henry?
Henry? Henry?!
