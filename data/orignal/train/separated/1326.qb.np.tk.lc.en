e voila .
what ? don &apos;t make a face . it &apos;s cute .
yeah , if you &apos;re playing mahjong .
so , why &apos;d you buy it ?
&apos;cause it was half off .
donations pile .
no , i want to look sexy but not like i &apos;m trying too hard .
you know , fun but not slutty .
you want casey guessing what kind of lacy balconette bra
you have on .
donations ?
no ! no , no , no !
maura , no , i was gonna wear that .
oh . okay . well , let &apos;s hope he likes the athletic look .
did you shave your legs ?
yes . pits too .
i just -- i hate that i have to go
to my high @-@ school reunion to get casey back here .
you know , there are three reasons
that people avoid their high @-@ school reunions .
yeah , one -- they hated high school .
two -- they hated everybody in high school .
what &apos;s the third one ?
embarrassment over getting fat .
then there &apos;s fear of running into your ex
or you &apos;re an abject failure .
why are you avoiding ?
abject failure .
i have no husband , no kids , no south end brownstone .
that was , you know , the thing
when i was in high school .
mm . i can see your point .
okay , if i wanted support like that ,
i would have called my mother .
sorry .
what time &apos;s casey &apos;s plane landing ?
should be getting in now . ooh .
aren &apos;t you a little worried he &apos;s gonna be too jet @-@ lagged ?
well , unless he arrives dead ,
i think he &apos;ll be up for some sex , no ?
oh , oh ! oh ! this is him . this is him .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
he &apos;s telling me to open up a chat room .
you know what ? he better not be standing me up .
jane ...
you don &apos;t look like you &apos;re at logan .
i &apos;m not . my squad was sent on a mission .
i &apos;ve just got back to base .
obviously , uh , i &apos;m not gonna make the reunion .
that &apos;s okay . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s no big deal .
yes , it is . tell him you miss him .
shh !
who &apos;s that ?
uh , that was just maura .
she said , you know , it &apos;s a shame you &apos;re gonna miss it .
jane , i @-@ i really wanted to see you .
i , uh -- they wouldn &apos;t even let us contact anyone .
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t apologize .
making the world safe for democracy .
thanks for understanding .
i , uh -- i got to go .
okay ? i &apos;ll call you soon .
okay . bye .
bye .
crap .
i &apos;m sorry .
you know what ? come on .
i am going to be your designated driver
so you can go drink with your high @-@ school nemeses .
it &apos;s &quot; -sis . &quot; isn &apos;t it &quot; nemesis &quot; ?
&quot; -ses &quot; when it &apos;s plural .
i &apos;m sure you have several formidable enemies .
oh , and how are you so &quot; sure &quot; ?
okay , yes , fine .
there was one group of mean girls --
debbie and emily and kate .
great ! so , let &apos;s go show debbie , emily , and kate
how fabulous you turned out to be .
i knew it . you just want to tag along so you can go
all jane goodall on me at my high @-@ school reunion
because you got imprisoned in an all @-@ girls&apos;
i was hardly &quot; imprisoned . &quot;
but , yes , i will admit
that the co @-@ ed experience interests me .
no . no . it &apos;s not gonna happen .
i &apos;m not going . and if i &apos;m not going , you &apos;re not going .
okay , see ? co @-@ ed high school .
you happy now ? let &apos;s go .
jane !
oh , another reason i didn &apos;t want you to come .
hello .
you two are still , uh ...
together ? yes . yes ,
we are still together .
get off me . sh-- um , shouldn &apos;t you run along ?
isn &apos;t there some &quot; barf of the week club &quot; member
you should be talking to ?
&quot; barf of the week &quot; ?
won it five times .
it &apos;s nice you two are still together .
the longest relationship i ever had was 34 days --
well , 35 if you count break @-@ up sex .
we &apos;ll count that .
hi , &quot; g. &quot;
whoa . hot , right ?
hi . you know , you look just like maria korkman .
but kind of like a hot , skinny version .
uh , giovanni ...
oh , you remember her .
man , she was fat , all right ?
hey , maria .
hey , jane .
i &apos;ve been working out .
no way . you know , you look so smokin &apos; hot ,
we &apos;re gonna need a garden hose to cool you down . oh .
god ...
reason number four that people hate high @-@ school reunions --
mean girl debbie nichols .
mm . relational aggression typical of adolescent females .
but she &apos;s long past that .
oh , my god . jane rizzoli .
oh , it &apos;s probably not &quot; rizzoli &quot; now .
it &apos;s mrs ...
mrs ... detective jane rizzoli .
there &apos;s no &quot; mrs. &quot; you ?
i &apos;m mrs. eddie tibbet .
you married eddie tibbet ?
yeah .
hey , jane .
hey , eddie .
look at you -- in a suit ! wow .
can you believe it ? me and eddie ?
oh , you mean because you
were part of the &quot; mean girls &quot; clique ?
maura .
hmm ? eddie , and , now , what clique were you a part of ?
the computer @-@ geek clique .
oh , me too . i &apos;m a science geek .
i &apos;m a geek now , too .
home and garden columnist for the boston dispatch
and a plant activist .
guess someone has to give a voice to plants .
she dumpster @-@ dives behind nurseries .
okay , well , you know , we ...
... we should probably get moving .
don &apos;t want to keep the name @-@ tag line held up .
nice to meet you .
okay . bye . bye .
oh ! i &apos;ve always wanted to go
to a high @-@ school reunion with a punch bowl .
there &apos;s a jello mold over here .
try not to hyperventilate .
come on . come on . let &apos;s go .
come on , come on .
i &apos;m getting punch .
okay , look .
purple dress . big boobs .
is that your bete noir ?
if that means former bff ,
yes . that would be emily .
what ? is that the one that dumped you in the 8th grade ?
well , who would need me when you could get
any guy on the planet with those things ?
mm , even steve sanner .
he was so nice . that &apos;s too bad .
a boyfriend ?
mm , i wish .
uh , no -- one date to see &quot; dumb &amp; dumber &quot;
doesn &apos;t constitute as a boyfriend .
come one . come on . let &apos;s go .
jane !
hey , steve and emily .
it &apos;s been too long .
i hear it &apos;s detective rizzoli these days .
yeah . yeah . yeah , it is .
this is my friend , dr . maura isles .
i know , right ? real waste , bro .
keep walking , giovanni .
we &apos;re just friends .
not friends @-@ friends . just close friends .
well , not -- not that close .
dr. isles tagged along because she missed out
on the whole co @-@ ed high @-@ school experience , so ...
well , we have to go man the hospitality table ,
but it &apos;s really good to see you .
you too . okay .
i &apos;ll be there in a sec .
okay .
i was , uh ...
excuse me .
i was hoping i &apos;d run into you .
uh , i need to talk to you about something .
is it okay if i call you ? uh ...
yeah . is -- is everything okay ?
well , look who stevie found -- roly @-@ poly rizzoli .
i almost didn &apos;t recognize you .
i hear you &apos;re a security guard or something .
she &apos;s a detective .
mnh @-@ mnh . don &apos;t bother .
this -- this is rory graham .
and now my night is complete .
if i had a nickel for every time a girl said that to me
yeah .
yeah . ha ha !
i &apos;m gonna go help emily .
stevie works for me .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read about how
i transformed graham biomedical
into an industry leader .
no , i only read the big stories .
big print , i think you mean .
wait -- you manufacture the melee heart valve .
that valve has transformed
the lives of children with heart defects
and people with cardiovascular disease .
the advanced bileaflet mechanical design
we came up with is pretty brilliant .
jane rizzoli ?
wow . you came to one of our reunions .
i heard you might .
kate .
this isn &apos;t stoli .
where &apos;s the lime , babe ?
was she a mean girl , too ?
queen of mean .
look at that body .
you definitely didn &apos;t have any kids , did you ?
well , i ... rescued a dog once . does that count ?
rory and i have three , actually .
two boys and a little girl .
yeah , kate was a high @-@ priced corporate lawyer .
but i was doing so well , i said , &quot; babe ...
i need a wife not a lawyer . &quot;
needs more lime , babe .
uh , do you miss your work ?
you know , every now and then i do , but i --
babe -- babe , i see some of the guys from the team .
hey ! football . rory led them to a state championship .
twice . later , rizzoli . doc .
bye .
rory graham just dissed me . again .
i &apos;m done . let &apos;s go .
okay .
go . all right , just move . go .
okay .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have gone .
how did that improve the quality of my life ?
i wonder what happened to clarissa wyndham .
there she is .
she married the duke of shernandorne .
what is it with the english and their ridiculous hats ?
the anglican church made women cover their heads .
w @-@ with a pink migrating goose ?
that &apos;s awful .
rizzoli .
yeah .
oh , my god .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
oh , my god .
it really is steve sanner .
jane !
somebody shot him . somebody shot steve .
i know . i know . i know .
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
can you take her ?
yeah , of course . she &apos;s like family .
okay .
come on . let &apos;s go get the
kids and bring them back to our house , okay ?
this is not the place for you , okay ?
and i will be by the house as soon as i can .
okay .
okay .
go . go on .
sorry . i ... i knew him .
i just spoke to him a few hours ago .
damn . i &apos;m sorry .
jane , we got this .
how &apos;d he die ?
gunshot wound to the chest .
appears to be a medium @-@ caliber entry wound .
wallet &apos;s still here . so we &apos;re thinking it wasn &apos;t a robbery .
yeah , shooting someone at their
high @-@ school reunion doesn &apos;t seem real random .
cellphone &apos;s here . i &apos;ll check the records .
lack of soot deposit and tattooing around the entrance wound .
so it doesn &apos;t look like a close range ?
i &apos;m not sure .
he has a large amount of metallic fiber on his clothing .
yeah .
looks like steel wool .
hey . can you take that ?
frost , can i have an evidence bag .
yeah .
found a piece of plastic .
look around . you see any more ?
yeah . yeah , yeah -- right here .
could have been a water bottle
with some steel wool shoved into it .
you thinking homemade silencer ?
yeah .
this is deliberate . took some planning .
there &apos;s some orange dirt here .
some over there . could be clay .
the track is artificial turf .
baseball diamond is that way .
maybe the killer walked across it .
i &apos;ll have csru check for footwear impressions
and get some clay sample for a comparison .
okay .
he said he wanted to talk to me .
maybe this is why .
and steve wasn &apos;t having any issues with anyone at work ?
disagreements with co @-@ workers ? people he managed ?
no . nothing . business was smooth .
steve was mr. nice guy , just like in high school .
uh , we do need to talk to emily .
she &apos;s upstairs with the children .
they &apos;re asleep .
i &apos;ll tell you anything you need to know .
do you want me to stay ?
it &apos;d be better if we spoke to emily alone .
all right , well ...
we &apos;ll be in the kitchen if you need us , okay ?
i &apos;m so , so sorry for your loss .
thank you .
was steve having problems with anyone ?
anyone that he might have run into at the reunion ?
no .
he was so excited about the reunion .
steve loved high school . we all did , right ?
right .
what about at work ?
you won &apos;t understand , but ... jane knows .
everybody loved steve .
everybody .
how was your marriage ?
were you and steve having any problems ?
we were happy .
we were the couple that everyone wanted to be .
i mean ...
it was a perfect life .
oh , jane ...
how am i gonna go on without him ?
hey , there . - oh , my --
what are you doing in my apartment ?
you left the web chat on .
thought i &apos;d say hello ,
find out how the reunion was .
oh , casey . it -- it was awful .
steve sanner was murdered last night .
what the hell ?
i left early , and -- and he was shot
on the football field a few hours later .
that &apos;s crazy .
wasn &apos;t he married to that cheerleader ?
um , emily someone -- the one with the , um ...
the one with the , um ... high a.p. scores ?
no . no . hmm , that &apos;s not it . let &apos;s see .
okay .
the one with the soccer scholarship ?
no , that &apos;s not it , either . hmm ...
okay , you know what i was gonna say .
wasn &apos;t she a friend of yours ?
yeah , she was until she became &quot; the one with the big boobs . &quot;
was rory graham there ?
he and steve had a business together .
yes , rory was there .
he and his head barely fit in the gym .
well , maybe they had a falling @-@ out .
i don &apos;t think so ,
but , you know , we &apos;re looking into it .
which , speaking of , i have to go to work .
like that ?
no , i was gonna take both towels off .
it &apos;s &quot; naked day &quot; at bdp .
i &apos;ve been thinking about you ... a lot .
yeah ? when you think about me ,
am i wearing a towel on my head ?
mnh @-@ mnh .
hanging up now .
too sweet ?
does it have white sugar ?
oh ? would you prefer brown ?
well , i only do stevia .
it &apos;s an herb . all @-@ natural .
oh . i &apos;ll get you a fresh glass .
they actually had a jello mold .
have you ever seen that ?
uh @-@ oh . incoming .
wish me luck .
melody ?
i &apos;m back . surprise !
surprise .
you &apos;re h-- wow . you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re here .
i &apos;m here .
uh , melody is my ex @-@ wife .
yeah , we -- we &apos;ve met .
dr. maura isles . nice to meet you .
likewise . i &apos;m not just any old ex .
i &apos;m the last and the best .
the other two were just warm @-@ ups , right vince ?
uh , yeah .
well , then , it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
uh , uh , can i talk to you ?
i would love that .
hi !
melody
hey .
how are you ?
you look wonderful .
uh , so do you .
we can talk over here .
okay . uh , later .
right .
what are you doing here ?
what do you suppose is going on ?
well , i don &apos;t know , ma . why don &apos;t you go follow them ?
why do you have to be so snippy ?
why do you have to be so snoopy ?
i have not seen that woman in five years .
why is she back ?
no idea .
you know , korsak raised her son for almost 10 years .
oh , my god . he never mentions him .
broke his heart when they divorced .
she moved away and took the son with her .
all right . um , okay .
did you start the autopsy on steve sanner ?
just about to .
okay . well , call me if you get anything .
of course .
checked criminal records
for everyone who attended your reunion .
everybody &apos;s pretty clean .
how many of them have alibis ?
about half .
so we have 75 suspects . swell .
how &apos;s melody ? i was surprised to see her .
oh , me too . don &apos;t ask . i won &apos;t tell .
who &apos;s melody ?
the ex @-@ wife who got away .
okay . got something .
ohh , god .
nice eyebrows .
don &apos;t you mean &quot; eyebrow &quot; ?
oh , a senior quote . that &apos;s sweet .
no , don &apos;t read . don &apos;t . it &apos;s dumb .
&quot; be who you are and say what you feel
&quot; because those who mind don &apos;t matter
and those who matter don &apos;t mind . &quot;
what ? i like dr. seuss .
look what i found . korsak the thespian .
what , were you the referee for the &quot; sonny &amp; cher &quot; show ?
that play was cutting @-@ edge for its time .
it got great reviews !
okay . e @-@ excuse me . steve sanner was a friend of mine .
can we get back on track here , please ?
sorry .
thank you .
steve sanner and rory graham the day graham biomedical
announced production of the melee valve .
nothing i could find on either .
steve and rory were like brothers .
in fact , steve was the only person rory was ever nice to .
one time , steve threw a football through a stained @-@ glass window .
and rory took the blame for it just so steve could go on a date .
must have been quite a girl .
i don &apos;t know about that .
it was me .
like i said ...
what do you think these numbers mean ?
they &apos;re in the &quot; notes &quot; section of steve &apos;s phone .
bank accounts maybe ?
maybe . they &apos;re too long to be i.p. addresses .
russian phone @-@ sex lines ?
oh , yeah , that was my first thought .
insight from a case i worked .
&quot; the case of the lonely detective . &quot;
steve made a few calls to a local preschool .
his kids are 10 and 12 .
why would he be calling a preschool ?
and six calls to a debbie tibbet .
yeah , i saw them talking at the reunion .
damn . she &apos;s married to edward tibbet .
guy owns a company that designs software .
he &apos;s worth about $ 50 million .
damn . i knew i should have been nicer to him .
just kidding . good for him .
he was always a sweetheart . yay . great .
just found a few more calls between debbie and steve .
any chance they might have been having an affair ?
i don &apos;t know . let &apos;s go ask debbie .
hello ?
hey . what are you doing here ?
we just wanted to ask you some questions .
okay . would you mind holding these alba roses ?
so awful about steve sanner .
yeah .
could you , uh , tell us about your relationship with him ?
what do you mean ?
come on , debbie . you know what i mean .
we have his phone records .
we ... ran into each other .
we had coffee , a few conversations .
were you having an affair ?
no .
of course not .
frost .
boston police !
now !
boston p.d. get out of the car .
damn it ! do you know how much this is gonna cost ?
keep your hands where we can see them .
take it easy . i &apos;m a private investigator .
then you know the drill .
two fingers -- pull some i.d.
slowly .
i got every right to be here .
you want to lose the attitude ?
we &apos;re in the middle of a homicide investigation .
you &apos;re interfering with a potential witness .
i got nothing to do with a homicide .
then why the paparazzi camera ?
it &apos;s okay . he &apos;s a ...
plant activist , as well .
okay . great .
husband thought she might be banging someone .
hired me to sit on her .
did you find proof ?
yeah . two different guys .
let me see it .
that &apos;s our victim .
show me the second guy .
who is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
all right . we &apos;re gonna need your memory card .
yeah , yeah , or you &apos;ll charge me with obstruction .
thank you .
i have to go get these plants watered and fertilized .
we have a few more questions , debbie .
i don &apos;t know anything , and i called our lawyer .
and he says i don &apos;t have to talk to you .
i &apos;m sorry , jane .
the whole school knew about it
the day she lost her virginity .
hmm . that mean you think she &apos;s hiding something ?
oh , yeah .
it all sounds good .
it &apos;s just ... a surprise , you know ?
he moved away five years ago .
i know .
it &apos;s all different now . i &apos;m different .
i don &apos;t need much to get it off the ground .
research is all here for you to look at .
how is he ?
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s 16 .
tough age .
i &apos;d like to see him .
i &apos;ll tell him that .
you and i divorced . i did not divorce him .
it didn &apos;t work out the way i &apos;d hoped with his dad .
i &apos;m here for him .
i have always been here for him .
think about whether you could ever be here for me again .
she &apos;s lovely .
wants to open a yoga studio .
she wants me to invest .
i always wanted to learn yoga .
did a class with her at lunch .
it &apos;s harder than it looks .
so you get a nice space with good energy
and some tinkly music .
i &apos;d go .
i could get a yoga body like melody .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m actually saying this ,
but i sort of feel sorry for emily .
adolescence is such a volatile time .
it probably wasn &apos;t easy for her , either .
oh , it was easy for her .
thanks to those boobs you saw
that arrived special delivery when she was 12 .
although large breasts can cause
back pain and severe sciatica .
well , turns out they can &apos;t protect you from the pain of life .
she said their marriage was perfect . not anymore .
oh , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s been perfect for a while .
bruxism .
hairline cracks indicating
excessive grinding due to stress .
muehrcke lines on his fingernails --
another stress indicator .
something was causing him enormous anxiety .
one of the most easygoing guys i &apos;ve ever met .
casey called this morning .
he misses you . how romantic .
not so much . it &apos;s more like skype @-@ us @-@ interruptus .
like coitus interruptus . i get it .
should i knock ?
what have you got ?
debbie tibbet was just found .
she &apos;s dead , jane .
it appears to be a suicide .
what ?
she put this noose around neck and leaned forward .
i don &apos;t believe this .
we just helped her rescuing roses few hours ago .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
i don &apos;t understand .
did your wife seem troubled about anything ?
yes .
the last few weeks were terrible .
she was like a different person .
we know about the private investigator
you hired to follow her .
debbie was suddenly so secretive .
did you confront steve at the reunion ?
no , of course not .
i didn &apos;t know what to do . i ...
just ...
didn &apos;t want to lose her .
you understand that we &apos;ll have to dig into your life
to make sure that &apos;s true .
that &apos;s okay , jane . i understand .
do you know who this is ?
no .
jane ?
do you think debbie killed herself ?
i knew her in high school , eddie .
she didn &apos;t .
there &apos;s no way .
what do you think ? did she kill herself ?
the bruising and deep @-@ tissue injury around the ligature
exceeds the circumference of the noose .
15 words where one would do -- &quot; no . &quot;
not a suicide .
she was strangled by the rope and posed in the chair .
looks like we &apos;ll be bringing eddie in after all .
we still don &apos;t have enough on him . ooh !
lower back pain , sergeant ?
ah , too much of this downward @-@ doggy thing with melody .
you know back pain is
the second most common ailment in the united states ?
what &apos;s the most common ailment ?
your fun facts ?
headaches .
so , she &apos;s got you doing yoga ?
this is getting serious .
i &apos;ve never known her to stick with anything .
maybe she &apos;s changed .
by acknowledging her change ,
you let go of past anger
and focus on the present .
thank you , deepak maura .
got something . jared mckay .
he &apos;s an investigative reporter for the boston dispatch .
just got off the phone with him .
was he having an affair with debbie ?
no . they went to journalism school together .
debbie said she had a friend --
someone high up in a big company --
who wanted to blow the whistle on something .
mckay doesn &apos;t know what .
debbie wouldn &apos;t give up the name .
well , that has to be steve sanner .
he was gonna blow the whistle , but on what ?
and why wouldn &apos;t debbie tell us they were meeting ?
rizzoli .
okay , calm down . what --
i &apos;ll be right there .
i got another dead classmate .
oh . here , drink this .
oh , thanks .
it &apos;s warm milk with a shot of whiskey .
come on , sit .
ma , you don &apos;t have a liquor license .
so arrest me .
i use it for when i make my chicken pot pie .
thanks , mrs. rizzoli .
oh , great .
so , now that you &apos;re half in the bag ,
can you tell me what happened ?
me and maria went to friendly &apos;s .
i order mac and cheese .
she gets a salad , with dressing on the side ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s so fit , like .
then all of a sudden , she says ,
&quot; oh , my god , my heart &apos;s racing . &quot;
so i @-@ i think this chick &apos;s really digging me , right ?
then she stops breathing .
oh , god . how awful .
yeah , you &apos;re telling me .
waiter calls 911 . i start doing cpr .
oh , i wouldn &apos;t even know how .
that &apos;s comforting , ma .
well , me neither , except i kind of learned the basics
at tony abruzzi &apos;s bachelor party
when this stripper starts --
um , can you just take me back to maria , please ?
all right , so everybody &apos;s yelling . it &apos;s crazy .
paramedics show up .
and she &apos;s dead -- right there on friendly &apos;s floor .
did maria ever make contact with debbie tibbet from our class ?
doubt it . debbie called her &quot; porky korkman . &quot;
i mean , maria hated debbie .
boy , that &apos;s terrible .
what about steve sanner ?
did she mention talking to him ?
he tried talking to her at the reunion ,
but what &apos;s he need her for , you know ?
i mean , emily &apos;s got those friggin &apos; --
hey , you could probably appreciate her tits , now , too , right ?
what ? excuse me ?
so maria didn &apos;t get a chance to talk to steve at the reunion ?
nah . nah , we left early .
to think i only got two days with the love of my life .
ohh . giovanni .
maria had a congenital heart condition .
cause of death -- heart attack .
maria korkman was a preschool teacher .
the same preschool that steve sanner was calling ?
yeah . counted three calls in the last week .
he wanted to talk to her .
bad . i wonder why .
badly .
i hate it when you correct me .
well , i hate it when you forget about mr. adverb .
it &apos;s a melee valve .
the one that steve &apos;s company makes ?
yes .
there &apos;s a fracture
at the base of the outflow strut
and a number of hairline cracks .
you said maria died of a heart attack
because she had a congenital heart condition .
no , i did not . i said she died of a heart attack .
but i didn &apos;t know why , and now i do .
she died because the valve failed .
the company is in the process
being bought out by c &amp; s medical .
if they come to terms ,
the partners stand to make tens of millions .
got the company &apos;s list of melee valve recipients .
3,200 people received the melee valve
since graham medical
received fda approval to start production .
look how many of them are kids .
heart @-@ valve repair is a very common pediatric surgery .
let &apos;s narrow the list . how many recipients have died ?
still looking at over 700 names .
can you isolate &quot; heart attack &quot; as the cause of death ?
damn . 118 deaths across the country .
we can &apos;t assume that if they died of heart attack
it &apos;s because they had a defective valve .
i never assume .
were any of them boston residents ?
why , you gonna exhume a body ?
charles gordon , 52 , and rene watkins , 11 .
i &apos;m gonna exhume two .
this is charles gordon &apos;s valve .
this is rene watkins &apos; valve .
both have similar fractures along the outflow strut .
so they &apos;re both defective ?
yes .
you think the higher @-@ ups at the company
knew their valves were failing ?
they &apos;ve seen the same reports we &apos;re looking at .
what are those numbers ?
the serial numbers on the valve .
maura , can you pull up the serial number
on the melee valve that you removed from maria ?
of course .
frost , can you pull up the numbers on the list
that you found in steve &apos;s phone ?
it &apos;s the same number .
steve knew they were making defective valves ,
and he knew one was in maria .
that &apos;s why he was calling her .
to warn her .
so , steve told debbie
because she was the only journalist he knew .
but debbie , the guerilla gardener ,
wasn &apos;t exactly mike wallace ,
so she reached out to her friend jared ,
the investigative reporter .
but someone figured out
that steve was about to spill his guts .
and if word of the defective valves got out ,
no big corporate sale .
mm @-@ hmm , and bye @-@ bye to rory graham &apos;s millions .
crime lab &apos;s analysis
of the granules found at the crime scene
show it &apos;s crushed shale , brick , and glass cullet .
it &apos;s used on red @-@ clay tennis courts .
and here i thought clay courts were made of clay .
and the crime lab matched the sample
to the clay courts at the maple leaf court country club .
oh , where rory and kate graham are members .
yeah , but it &apos;s not enough to arrest him .
no , but it is enough to bring him in just so i can say hi .
sorry to take you away from your game .
you didn &apos;t . it was a fast match .
i won all three sets .
i &apos;m curious why , at the reunion ,
you didn &apos;t mention the fact
that you &apos;re selling your company to c &amp; s medical .
i don &apos;t comment on business deals until they close .
does c &amp; s medical know they &apos;re spending
tens of millions of dollars for a flawed valve design ?
what are you talking about ?
we have proof that your melee valve is defective .
steve knew that , and he &apos;s dead .
you &apos;re trying to bait me .
i didn &apos;t kill my friend .
perfect timing .
do you want to read your texts on your own time , rizzoli ?
hey . it &apos;s detective rizzoli .
whatever .
next time you want to chat , call my legal team .
you might want to take a cab .
just got my warrant to search your office and your car .
melody &apos;s got me doing a cleanse .
guys really will do anything to get laid .
how is josh ?
i don &apos;t know . haven &apos;t seen him .
i &apos;m sorry .
she &apos;s talking about moving back .
what if she &apos;s only back for money ?
do you care ?
no , not if i get to see josh .
been through 10 of these computers
we confiscated from graham biomedical .
nothing so far .
hey , i got something .
&quot; i &apos;m friggedy frost , i &apos;m just like ice &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m always chillin &apos; , i &apos;m up on the mike &quot;
&quot; you catchin &apos; a cold because i &apos;m always illin &apos; &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m wiggedy wow with my style , i got crazy steeze &quot;
&quot; and mad flavor , you should call me mr.tastee freeze &quot;
i could flow .
okay , okay . now we &apos;re talking .
just found a deleted search
on how to make a homemade silencer .
was that on rory &apos;s computer ?
no , this is steve sanner &apos;s .
doubt our victim was looking up ways to silently shoot himself .
people carry around their laptops .
his wife , emily , could have had access to it .
you think she killed him to hang on to their fortune ?
wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
you know what this is , don &apos;t you , emily ?
a water bottle ?
is that a filter ?
it &apos;s a homemade silencer ,
like the one used to shoot your husband .
what ?
we know steve was about to go public
on his company &apos;s defective valve .
would have sent c &amp; s medical running for the hills .
no buyout . no big bucks .
but with steve dead ,
his share of the company reverts to you .
is that what this is about ?
he must have known money never mattered to me .
money matters to everyone .
he was so tortured .
i knew it had something to do with his work .
and why didn &apos;t you tell us that before ?
i found this tucked into the spokes of my son &apos;s bike .
now i think i know why debbit didn &apos;t come to us earlier .
your boyfriend is on your desk .
wow . twice in two days .
a girl could start to feel special .
you are special .
shh ! come on -- i &apos;m at work , all right ?
so , tell me how your case is going .
it &apos;s bad , casey .
debbie tibbet was found dead .
someone was threatening emily sanner .
we know it &apos;s about money , but , you know ,
whoever &apos;s doing this is just a serious ,
cold @-@ blooded killer .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s a classmate .
people do crazy things when they &apos;re desperate , you know ?
csru is processing rory &apos;s car .
okay .
i got to go tear apart an insanely expensive ride .
come to afghanistan . it &apos;s great .
120 @-@ degree heat . you can eat dust all day .
you can wear a burka .
oh , my god . how totally fun .
too bad -- murder calls .
i miss you .
i miss you , too .
i &apos;m hearing everything you &apos;re saying .
okay .
bye , jane .
bye , casey .
traces of red clay on the gas pedal and floor mats .
no blood .
yeah , rory was smart .
if he was the shooter ,
he might have been wearing
something to cover his clothes .
let &apos;s check the trunk .
yeah .
hey , can you shine a u.v. light in here ?
look .
that &apos;s steel wool , isn &apos;t it ?
used in the homemade silencer .
there . that &apos;s blood .
my office , my car ,
now you &apos;re in my home , rizzoli ?
this is harassment . i &apos;m calling my lawyer .
make sure you mention the blood we found in your trunk .
steve sanner &apos;s blood .
sir , ma &apos;am , i &apos;m gonna ask these two officers
to escort you to your living room .
this is my house .
i don &apos;t need to go sit in my living room .
honey , they have a warrant .
babe -- - i &apos;d listen to your lawyer wife .
or we could arrest you
for interference with a police officer .
this is bullshit .
i played a set once at stade roland garros --
french open .
i &apos;d love to hear about that ...
when we &apos;re really old .
can you check that for blood , please ?
no sign of blood .
you know , debbie &apos;s killer made it look like
she hung herself in a chair .
maybe that &apos;s because she wasn &apos;t strong enough
to lift the body up .
&quot; she &quot; ?
as in , mrs. graham ?
no , negative for blood .
but there are some rubber pellets embedded in the heel .
those are pieces of artificial turf .
same stuff on the football field
where steve sanner was shot .
where &apos;s mrs. graham ?
i let her go to the bathroom .
kate ?
kate , open the door .
in a minute .
no , now .
since when am i not allowed
to go to the bathroom in my own house ?
since you became a murder suspect .
i beg your pardon ?
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of steve sanner
and debbie tibbet .
this is ridiculous .
i want my lawyer .
you threatened debbie , didn &apos;t you ?
just like in high school , and you scared her , too .
she didn &apos;t open her mouth
when steve sanner was murdered .
this is absurd .
i &apos;m not even gonna dignify that with a response .
ow ! you &apos;re hurting me .
did you hear a flush ?
nope .
check the tank .
the drive &apos;s messed up ,
but the ceramic disc inside will be just fine .
bet we &apos;ll find all of steve &apos;s files on it .
isn &apos;t that fantastic , kate ?
why &apos;d you do it ?
so you could live like this ?
with rory graham ?
i don &apos;t care how much money he has .
he &apos;s always gonna be a dickhead .
you don &apos;t have to tell me that .
&quot; get me a drink , babe .
pick up my socks , babe .
you &apos;re putting on weight , babe . &quot;
what the hell &apos;s going on here ?
why don &apos;t you tell him , babe ?
your wife murdered your best friend
and debbie tibbet .
you what ?
you weren &apos;t gonna take care of it .
you didn &apos;t even bother to look at
your stupid football bro &apos;s laptop until i showed you .
oh , boo @-@ hoo . we &apos;re making broken valves .
why don &apos;t we all cry about it like little girls
and take down the company ?
he wasn &apos;t gonna talk !
cuff him .
wait , what ?
you &apos;re under arrest for the murder of maria korkman .
maria korkman ? the fat chick from high school ?
no , the preschool teacher
who died from one of your valves ,
the first of many of your victims ,
which is second @-@ degree murder ... babe .
let &apos;s go .
when you invited me to play ,
i thought you meant on actual courts .
this is how i used to play when i was a kid .
we can go to my club .
they have fresh mint lemonade .
free refills ?
yes !
no !
so , um , casey called this morning again .
and i got those little butterflies in my stomach
like i was 17 again .
release of epinephrine .
draws blood away from the stomach
and sends it to the muscles .
you are lovesick .
wh ...
the one who misses it gets it .
lovesick ?
run .
it might balance high dopamine
and norepinephrine levels present
because of your inability to consummate .
stop . i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll get the ball .
