that &apos;s the key .
how do we find the evidence box it opens ?
we let mozzie run with the key .
you said senator pratt could hurt you .
he knows we &apos;re on to him .
we woke a giant , neal .
my brakes -- i don &apos;t have my brakes .
what ?
what ?
peter went after a u.s. senator ,
but someone wants him to stop .
you look into this key without him .
ellen must have made it when she first moved to new york .
what does that remind you of ?
it &apos;s a cityscape , moz .
these are buildings .
pratt doesn &apos;t know about this .
neither does peter .
neal thinks he &apos;s in the lead here ...
but i &apos;m with him .
then , all of a sudden , we ended up
at this warehouse underneath the brooklyn bridge .
the party was insane .
and the topper was this junkie comes in
just to steal copper piping right out the wall .
right out of the wall , huh ?
this is your stop .
oh ! um ... you got change of a $ 20 ?
change ? no .
seriously ?
seriously .
keep it .
warehouse by water street -- copper pipe in the walls .
hacks @-@ a @-@ lot , go for me .
good day bleeding fares for info ?
i am bacchus ,
and they &apos;re literally pouring wine down my throat .
at least one of us is getting drunk .
oh , intel gathering not going as well on your end ?
no , the view from ellen &apos;s first apartment
doesn &apos;t match the key .
pick me up ?
be right there .
all right .
this is where neal is now .
you can &apos;t see anything from here .
no , he &apos;s got to be on the balcony .
here we go . here &apos;s his view .
does it match up ?
i don &apos;t think so .
well , i never expected him to be crisscrossing the city like this .
if i was a betting man ,
i &apos;d say he &apos;s trying to throw someone off his scent .
eh , he knows we &apos;re the only ones who can access his tracking data .
peter , that &apos;s my point .
i know , but he doesn &apos;t know that we made a copy of the key .
oh , that &apos;s el . we &apos;re done for the day .
tell me she doesn &apos;t know you &apos;re still following the key ?
no , ever since the accident , she wants me to take it easy .
yeah , and anything neal related is exactly the opposite .
keep monitoring his anklet . we &apos;ll catch up later .
hey , honey .
oh , hey , clinton .
i didn &apos;t know you guys were working today .
the city never sleeps .
oh , you just caught us wrapping up .
great to see you .
you , too .
bye .
i &apos;ll walk him out .
thanks , jones . see you .
babe ?
why aren &apos;t you wearing your sling ?
what ?
hey . where to ?
ellen once mentioned
she liked to watch the tugboats from brooklyn bridge park .
hmm , tugboats . really ?
i know i &apos;m grasping at straws .
moz , i &apos;m not paying you for the ride .
oh , you are if we &apos;re to brooklyn .
honey , you know neal doesn &apos;t want you looking into the key .
neal doesn &apos;t lie to me . he hides the truth .
he withholds it , but he ...
... doesn &apos;t lie to me .
and if he is , there &apos;s got to be a reason for it .
well , maybe he doesn &apos;t want to drag you into a mine field .
really ? this is the only way to brooklyn ?
believe me , we missed a lot of traffic .
besides , chasing wild geese is expensive sport .
it &apos;s not a wild goose chase .
we know more than when we started .
yeah , we know the key doesn &apos;t match
the view from ellen &apos;s place on roosevelt island ,
or her favorite knoll in central park ,
or her ex @-@ boyfriend &apos;s loft in soho .
yeah , i get it . we &apos;ve had a lot of dead ends .
but she had a reason behind this .
to cut a skyline into a sliver of metal
without any indication of what it points to or why ?
she thought i &apos;d know .
must be some part of her life i &apos;m not remembering .
5v78 ? ! that &apos;s my cab !
he &apos;s driving my cab !
citizen &apos;s arrest ! cease and desist !
what the hell , moz ? don &apos;t --
look ! look it ! his tag number !
that &apos;s me !
he has the same taxi medallion .
mine is legal !
moz , it &apos;s me .
it is ! i paid a full rock to be 5v78 .
who the hell is this guy ? !
mozzie , relax . don &apos;t -- don &apos;t got after him , mozzie !
it &apos;s not --
moz ! that &apos;s a red light !
can you at least turn off the meter ?
i mean , honey , you were hospitalized ,
hughes lost his job ,
ellen is dead and so is her killer . i mean ...
pratt is dangerous , and i got to stop him .
then stop him as an fbi agent .
all right , but if neal has some scheme or heist planned ,
i &apos;m not a part of it .
then what are you doing ?
watching . so that i can control the outcome .
honey , i am safe here on the sidelines .
i think it &apos;s good he lied to you .
hi , neal .
oh , of course he does .
i &apos;m aiding and abetting the fuzz
and i &apos;m the one in manacles ?
you ran five consecutive red lights .
i was apprehending a criminal .
they think you &apos;re the criminal .
this medallion isn &apos;t registered to you .
this is fraud !
says the man driving a cab under an assumed name .
unless -- is this your real name ?
oh , nice try , suit .
hal hoover is just trying to make an honest living .
he &apos;s neither honest , nor living .
why is he driving a cab ?
to vacuum for tips .
from sex lives to stock tips , the hal hoover story .
i got them to let you off with a fine .
so you &apos;re done here .
i &apos;m done ?
yeah , well , somebody should have the key .
are you aware of the legwork required
to legally operate a yellow cab in new york city ?
yes , you can rent or buy a medallion
from the taxi &amp; limousine commission .
the potential for profit is enormous !
i know , the medallions are auctioning
for about a million dollars each .
how did you get yours ?
i paid -- in full .
i &apos;m sure you can guess .
don &apos;t want to know .
that medallion is the only thing
separating me from being a gypsy , suit .
a gypsy !
and now some hack is driving around with a counterfeit .
i get it .
upstanding citizen hal hoover has brought me a case .
wait , so let me process this --
mozzie drives a cab to gather intel on his fares ?
calls it his yellow girlfriend .
oh , that makes me uncomfortable .
well , it &apos;s a common phrase amongst cabbies .
i reviewed his bill of sale . it &apos;s legit .
shows that he purchased the medallion four months ago .
all right , so why does the taxi &amp; limousine commission
say luke dusarque of gotham taxi owns it ?
his girlfriend &apos;s stepping out .
cute -- my working theory is that
someone from the tlc is manipulating records .
yeah , but the real owner could file a report .
well , not if you target victims who would be afraid to report it ,
like new cabbies or recent immigrants .
but whoever stole it is covering their tracks .
there &apos;s no link to any of the employees at tlc .
then we go after the buyer .
want us to subpoena dusarque &apos;s records ?
you want to put hal hoover down
as the main testimony backing that request ?
you ever ask yourself if it &apos;s worth it ?
do i wonder why i don &apos;t arrest mozzie
and be done with it ?
yes .
every time he opens his mouth , i reach for my cuffs .
but it looks like he may be right .
so what , then ?
we ask dusarque for his records straight up ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t think
he &apos;ll hand them over to an fbi agent .
peter billings ?
sounds like a tv anchor .
no tlc for my tlc id ?
oh , i &apos;ve been waiting on a tlc joke ,
but that was not good .
i &apos;ll work on it .
please don &apos;t .
peter billings . i need to see your fare book .
tlc agents are glorified dmv reps .
i wouldn &apos;t flash that too much .
i &apos;m just getting into character .
please don &apos;t .
i &apos;ll tell you , guys -- miracle of life ?
the only miracle is that i didn &apos;t get a hernia
scrubbing the stains out of my floor mats .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
his best columbo impression ?
he &apos;s not columbo . i &apos;m columbo . get him out of here .
all right .
it &apos;s the third time someone &apos;s given birth in my cab .
i mean , i &apos;m not even a father !
i feel like a freaking midwife !
peter billings of the tlc .
i need to speak with luke dusarque , please .
office .
thank you .
frank , bring the keys to 6v92 .
i swear , i &apos;ve never seen
that amount of copper pipe in my life .
you know that plastic is the newest thing now , right ?
hey ! you ... hal !
you drove me to katz &apos;s deli the other day .
i left my wallet in your car .
oh , yeah . katz &apos;s , right --
the bad tipper .
really ? bad tipper ?
is that why you drove off with $ 500 of my money ?
yeah . yeah . not so sassy now , are we ?
i &apos;d like a word with you , please ?
whoever said the customer &apos;s always right
never met the customer , am i right ?
that &apos;s funny .
carmen &apos;s pulling 8r62 out now .
you didn &apos;t trust peter and i alone on this ?
three in the hand is better than none in the bush .
stop trying to make that a saying . did you get anywhere ?
did i ? i was chatting with earl here .
i guess every so often , the cabbies come in and find
that dusarque has left a new car on the lot .
if i can get inside that cab , i could hack the gps .
oh , and pull a home base
on where the medallions are coming from ?
well , we don &apos;t have time to break in and hot wire it .
we &apos;ll need the key .
frank , where are we on those keys ?
you have your 5v78 paperwork on you ?
they can &apos;t take everything away from hal hoover .
why ?
&apos;cause a bill of sale looks a lot like a lease agreement
to a busy woman .
let &apos;s go get your wallet back .
look , lady , we dropped you off at your destination ,
we charged your card , end of story .
luke dusarque . wanda said you needed me ?
peter billings , tlc .
not afraid of losing repeat customers , huh ?
can &apos;t let people walk all over you .
so ?
yeah , we &apos;ve had rumors
of cabbies giving unreported cash rides .
i got to check your records . it &apos;s routine .
great . that the year ?
the month .
ah , you mind if i make
a few copies of these fare logs ?
the rest of them are over there .
let me know if i need to fire anybody .
gotham . this is luke .
i already told you , buddy , it &apos;s not in there !
it &apos;s $ 500 , danny devito !
the least you can let me do is look inside the cab .
gotham . please hold .
can you believe this , wanda ? !
calvin klein here comes into my place of business
and publicly attacks my character !
i don &apos;t have time for this . who are you ?
uh , hal . i leased 5v78 last week .
really ? you paid $ 4,000 a month to rent a taxi medallion ?
yeah , i bet you do need some extra cash , pal .
hey ! doesn &apos;t mean i take
something that wasn &apos;t mine . right , wanda ?
let the man look in the car if it &apos;ll settle this .
thank you ! - frank , i need the keys to 5v78 -- stat !
thank you , wanda . you &apos;re a very reasonable person ...
unlike him .
oh , this one ? you have no idea .
gotham taxi . hold , please .
got the i.d. number .
great , i &apos;ll be in their firewall within an hour .
all right .
or i &apos;ll simply call the company
and requisition their logs .
so when i do it , i &apos;m a criminal .
but when you do it , you &apos;re a patriot ?
god bless the government .
peter billings , tlc .
i &apos;m going to need you two to step out of the vehicle .
seriously ?
yeah .
incredible !
dusarque has all the appropriate paperwork
co @-@ opting my medallion and my ride log .
the hubris !
didn &apos;t even bat an eye when he handed it over .
these fare logs go back
all four months you &apos;ve owned the medallion .
yeah , most of these are my fares .
mine . mine . mine . mine ... not mine !
all right , that &apos;s when the medallion switched hands .
two thursdays ago .
yeah , leaving us with 20 or so addresses
above that on the gps to track down .
you read , i &apos;ll search .
1023 east rivington street .
... 23 east riving @-@ ton street .
that &apos;s a residence of a film producer ...
suspended her mail delivery
because she &apos;s just returning from a film shoot in romania .
and used the cab to return from jfk .
next .
seriously , grey gardens ,
this is the pace we &apos;re gonna go at ?
justice requires patience , little edie .
all right , 1297 east houston .
that &apos;s a donut shop
owned and operated by an 82 @-@ year @-@ old man and his wife .
maybe they &apos;re fencing medallions to build a retirement fund ?
all right , 656 west 125th street .
that &apos;s ... the cotton club .
i thought that shut down .
they had a soft opening two months ago .
testing the waters for a bigger one .
elizabeth has been begging me to go .
who owns it now ?
june used to tell me about singing there with byron .
two brothers -- angelo and delmon wells .
delmon &apos;s recently back from a stint at rikers .
four years -- b &amp; e
and angelo ...
works at the taxi &amp; limousine commission .
that &apos;s the guy ! he must be selling the medallions !
the club &apos;s a cash business .
it &apos;s the perfect place to clean the profit .
if that &apos;the case , it might show up on their balance sheet .
you ready to go for a ride ?
here we are . tips welcome .
here &apos;s a tip -- clean these seats . - all right , let &apos;s go .
uh , we can handle this , columbo .
hey , three in the hand is better than none in the bush .
just stay here and don &apos;t get in any trouble .
i don &apos;t know why you still bother saying that .
that &apos;s the fastest i &apos;ve gotten a cab in harlem
or anywhere .
almost makes me change my mind about wanting to sell the place .
oh , you &apos;re the owner ?
uh @-@ huh . you new ?
no !
i &apos;m an opportunist .
you can smell the history in this place .
yeah , history smells like an old ashtray .
we &apos;re never gonna get a look at their financials
if that &apos;s your attitude .
my attitude might not come into play .
we &apos;re a couple of sore thumbs here .
all right , no fbi .
roll with me on this .
oh , just once i &apos;d love an explanation to follow that sentence .
we don &apos;t open till 7 : 00 , gentlemen .
i know . neal craig -- talent management .
this your place ?
mine and my brother &apos;s -- delmon wells .
and i &apos;m with the label .
peter billings -- swing low sound .
you guys got a pretty good stable .
well , thanks . i helped rebuild it .
so why are you here ?
well , we know you &apos;re also in the process of rebuilding .
we thought we &apos;d offer some fresh talent to draw crowds .
fresh is code for young and fleeting ,
and this club doesn &apos;t do &quot; american idol . &quot;
you interested in classic acts ?
little less lana del rye --
more booker little resolving notes on his trumpet ?
which is what i booked for this friday &apos;s reopening .
got me an old @-@ school trio -- sax , drums , and an organ .
you could still use a singer .
must be nice , running a club like that .
you want it , you can have it .
well , if you &apos;re not into it , why are you reopening the club ?
that &apos;d be my brother .
he ditches town for a while ,
comes back and declares us open for business .
oh , you don &apos;t like to be told what to do .
that &apos;s right .
my mother leaves us a club i don &apos;t want ,
my brother leaves me to run it ,
meanwhile nobody cares i got a day job to worry about .
oh , where &apos;s that ?
tlc .
taxi &amp; limousine commission ?
ding @-@ ding .
5v78 .
you lease this from dusarque over at gotham ?
yeah . you really know your cabs .
i can barely get one myself .
this game &apos;s rigged , man .
no , they ...
that &apos;s the reason they call it the empire city .
you got to scrape where you can .
how do you scrape ?
by taking joy in the one good thing about my job .
what &apos;s that ?
hiring cigar girls .
i &apos;ve never heard of june ellington .
no , but you &apos;ve heard of her husband , byron .
byron ellington , the trumpeter ?
got a hell of a ride out of that last name .
he played with don byas back then .
and june sang lead until byron got sick .
you guys have piqued my interest ,
but , uh , we &apos;re a small operation .
i can &apos;t just write a big check at the end of the night .
i &apos;m sure we can work something out .
so why would a label let their artist work on the cheap ?
i think what he means to say is --
music isn &apos;t born in madison square garden .
it starts here , in clubs like this
music has to come from somewhere to go somewhere .
well , i handle the talent , but my brother keeps the books .
we usually do a straight percentage of 65 .
i think we can do better than a straight percentage for june .
and we still have to hear an e.p. before we settle on anything .
won &apos;t be a problem .
could i trouble you for a matchbook ?
it &apos;s for my wife . she &apos;s a big fan of this place .
okay .
thanks .
you should invite your wife for the reopening . thank you .
all right , i think we all got what we need here .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
okay .
looking forward to hearing that album .
what was that back there ?
&quot; music isn &apos;t born in madison square garden ? &quot;
el &apos;s weekly dissertation
when she puts her morgana king album on .
where the hell is mozzie ?
i don &apos;t know why you still bother .
so , you actually listen to me
when i rant about something , huh ?
marriage is for better or for worse .
you know , the cotton club brings back a lot of memories .
when i first came to new york ,
i used to go there every thursday night .
why &apos;d you stop ?
they shut down . a lot of these old places do .
yeah , it doesn &apos;t help the businesses
when the owners are crooks .
does that mean i don &apos;t get to go to the reopening ?
if they &apos;re using the club to launder money ,
there won &apos;t be a reopening .
don &apos;t lose hope -- it might take us past friday
to isolate the discrepancies in the books .
i know event venues .
i could probably save you a few hours of work .
okay . let &apos;s see . okay .
they have 30 tables , turnover an hour per table ,
here they have total attendance at 220 .
but see , they &apos;re only putting 300 linens to be washed .
it should be well over 500 .
well , they could be reusing them to cut costs .
yeah , or they could be padding the head count
and tabbing an extra couple grand every night .
that &apos;s my girl !
oh . can you nail &apos; em ?
not yet . these scams are nearly impossible to prove .
smart .
hey . my yellow girlfriend and i return with news .
come on in .
sure . angelo recognized my taxi number .
it &apos;s definitely him .
yeah , and possibly his brother .
then why the dillydallying ?
arrest and return all the seized goods .
based on your observations and a laundry bill ? try again .
we need eyes on the operation , someone on the inside .
hmm . know any cute cigar girls ?
thanks , toots .
i better not hear you laughing .
oh , we &apos;re laughing with you , toots .
security guard by the stairs has got a metal detector .
yeah . i wonder what that &apos;s about .
i got eyes on angelo .
he &apos;s headed downstairs with a briefcase .
see if you can follow him .
all right .
hands .
oh , nice . what &apos;s this ?
on the house .
thank you !
yeah !
i got to reload .
sorry -- earrings .
what &apos;s in it ?
nothing .
angelo !
i said , &quot; nothing . &quot;
damn beanie babies . what &apos;s the difference ?
don &apos;t patronize me then .
i &apos;m not asking for a kidney .
how many times you expect me to do this
without knowing what i &apos;m doing ?
come on !
luke said he &apos;ll be here friday at 8 : 30 to get the briefcase .
friday &apos;s the reopening .
what ? there &apos;s a &quot; no swapping briefcases &quot; rule ?
i just don &apos;t want you getting into trouble .
then help me out . now , open the safe .
angelo &apos;s selling another medallion .
and delmon doesn &apos;t know anything about it .
* i got harlem on my mind *
so you &apos;re not coming on friday ?
i told you . dusty jazz acts ain &apos;t my thing .
boss , did you get all that ?
i did . see if you can get eyes on that safe .
i &apos;ll try .
i don &apos;t hear anyone . i &apos;m going in .
watch yourself .
you &apos;re the new girl .
yeah , um , i was just --
venturing someplace you got absolutely no business being .
diana ?
i &apos;m sorry . i got lost .
lost ? that &apos;s not gonna hold .
no , but she knows that .
well , there &apos;s two doors in that hallway .
one goes to the humidor , and one goes to my office .
guess you didn &apos;t have trouble finding the humidor .
no .
i , um -- i heard about your vinyl collection .
i wanted to take a look .
so , you &apos;ll risk getting fired
to come in here to see some dusty jazz acts ?
if you &apos;re calling an original pressing of james rushing
a &quot; dusty jazz act , &quot; then you and me got a problem .
you got some balls , girl . spark me up one of those .
smart . the apple and eve . she couldn &apos;t resist .
oh , now you help yourself to a principito ?
i &apos;m officially jealous .
have you ever had a principito ?
no .
they &apos;re the reason why we have five senses .
what , you can hear them ?
light one up , and tell me it doesn &apos;t sing .
well , i see you got the same good taste in music
that you have in your cigars .
it &apos;s your record .
naw , it &apos;s my mom &apos;s .
i just get credit for not selling it .
you ever wonder where it comes from --
our need for music ?
well , it catalogues our memories .
a record like that , it just puts you someplace .
where &apos;s it put you ?
the first time i heard jimmy rushing was not on wax .
it was here .
you couldn &apos;t have been more than 7 .
6 -- i remember just sitting on a barstool ,
playing drums in my head
like jo jones was onstage ,
which incidentally , can &apos;t be done .
and my brother angelo --
yeah , he interviewed me .
he was 4 years old , man .
he &apos;s running around , &quot; devil in his eyes &quot; wild .
arms flailing like he was underwater .
i don &apos;t think he knew exactly what he was doing ,
but he knew what he was doing , you know ?
does he still know what he &apos;s doing ?
um , he &apos;s been flailing around a bit lately ,
but his heart &apos;s still in it .
but i &apos;ll always remember him spinning around up there .
that &apos;s why we need the music .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re trying to recapture with the reopening .
i figure if i can remind him of what he &apos;s missing ,
maybe he &apos;ll just keep his flailing on the dance floor .
you did a bang @-@ up job with the place .
good booze , best musicians alive ...
cigar girls .
yeah , speaking of which , uh , isn &apos;t your break about up ?
it is .
yeah .
i hope what you &apos;re doing pays off .
yeah . me , too .
and the music never stops .
we shouldn &apos;t be arresting delmon .
sounds like a decent guy .
i know , but our only definitive link to the crime
is in a safe , in the back office of the cotton club .
what are the chances delmon will roll on angelo
if we bust him making the exchange with dusarque ?
none . he loves angelo .
he &apos;d go silent before rolling on his baby brother .
so the guilty brother walks , and the innocent one does time ?
no .
you have an idea ?
we need to force angelo to show up at the meet .
i met dusarque . he &apos;s a bull .
if something goes wrong ,
he &apos;ll demand answers directly from angelo .
if the medallion somehow disappeared ,
that &apos;d give him reason to be upset .
we replace the real medallion with a decoy .
a disappearing decoy ?
a melting one .
like the ice diamond you gave the czarina in russia .
no .
can we get in the safe to make the swap ?
the safe lock &apos;s voice @-@ recognition .
i think i have a vocal key .
* i got harlem on my mind *
that &apos;s why he was singing . those lyrics unlock the safe .
although i hate to break it to you ,
that laptop &apos;s not getting past the security &apos;s metal detector .
for that matter , any kind of recorder or play @-@ back device .
what if it &apos;s vinyl ?
maybe it &apos;s time for june ellington to come out of retirement .
all right . delmon is a connoisseur of vinyl ,
so we need to press an album
that looks and sounds authentic to the &apos; 60s .
think you can handle it ?
you know i can handle it .
of course she can .
so we &apos;re gonna record you singing on both channels
but hide delmon &apos;s voice key on the left audio track .
that way , when neal plays it back , it will open the safe .
my only question is , what songs am i singing ?
&quot; ain &apos;t nobody &apos;s business &quot; and &quot; harlem on my mind &quot; --
delmon &apos;s taste --
but i &apos;ll show you how to class it up .
listen , little man , if you think you can show me some class ,
you have another thought coming .
talent .
okay . i think we &apos;re good .
i &apos;m gonna get started on those melting medallions .
got our rush job back from the printers . here .
wow . look at that .
great photo of you , june .
well , what do you think ?
if the songs are good , we &apos;re good .
oh , the songs are good .
the songs are exceptional . you dig ?
uh , the question is , will delmon agree ?
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
what do you think ?
honestly , i think it &apos;s a bunch of bull .
i mean , these guys had this woman at the head ,
and it was byron that made it big ?
so she &apos;s your girl for the reopening ?
yeah , man . she &apos;s my girl .
check , check !
aw , hon , thanks for letting me come .
i sort of got the impression i didn &apos;t have a choice .
you didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s better than i remember .
yeah , delmon has done a lot of work
to return the club to its former glory .
well , you tell him your wife approves .
well , you can tell him yourself .
we ready to go ?
yeah . june &apos;s all set .
excited to hear those pipes live and in person .
we all are .
mr. wells , this is my wife elizabeth .
oh , the jazz fan .
excuse me .
yeah .
i saw steve coleman perform years ago --
nearly blew my skirt right off .
green room .
look at this turnout .
i see the ellington name still carries some weight around here .
yes .
ladies and gentlemen ,
i &apos;m so excited to introduce mrs. june ellington .
peter , hey !
i thought you were tracking dusarque .
he must have gotten anxious because he &apos;s on his way in here .
neal just went down a minute ago .
well , you got to stall the exchange .
i can &apos;t . dusarque will recognize me .
okay . all right . hang back .
we &apos;ve got it covered .
all right . tell diana to get moving .
honey , i got to make myself scarce .
okay .
it is so wonderful to see --
to see all of you here this evening .
thank you for being here .
i &apos;m gonna get settled in with my band ,
and we &apos;ll begin in just a moment .
hey , uh , you own this place , right ?
yeah , i do , but i &apos;m busy right now .
hey , listen .
do you have any more of those principitos laying around ?
you have to ask my cigar girl .
you &apos;re not gonna miss june &apos;s performance , are you ?
no , but i do have some business to handle , so ...
let it wait .
i hear she &apos;s gonna dedicate her first song to you .
you did hear that , huh ?
all right . we &apos;re all set to begin tonight .
so sit back , relax , and enjoy .
and again , thank you very much for coming .
but first , um , before i get started ,
i &apos;m dry .
could i have a little water , please ?
thank you so much .
thank you .
thank you .
um , i want us to all dedicate this song to
mr. delmon wells .
and i think a song about harlem is very appropriate
because he has helped to put harlem back on our minds .
thank you .
it &apos;s all yours .
* i got harlem on my mind *

you &apos;re early .
so &apos;s dusarque . delmon could be here any second .
all right . let &apos;s make the swap .
we &apos;ve got about five minutes from now until it melts .
let &apos;s hope dusarque is ready to swap his cash for this .
don &apos;t tell her i &apos;m gone .
okay .
that bought us a little time .
busy night . you should be happy .
yeah , you know , june &apos;s great ,
but i was hoping my brother would show .
well , there &apos;s still a chance .
your mom would be proud .
yeah . yeah . i &apos;ll see you out there .
clockwork ?
nope . skin of our teeth .
thank you .
he knows he shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
the lengths we go to to protect family .
thank you very much .
mozzie &apos;s got to keep dusarque occupied
long enough for the medallion to melt .
if anyone can keep someone occupied , it &apos;s mozzie .
son of a ...
taxi !
hey , where you headed , pal ?
gowanus .
yeah , wanda , i &apos;m gonna need a tow from the cotton club .
someone slashed my tire .
no , i am not waiting around in harlem .
oh , you got -- you got to be kidding me .
oh , just -- just give her a second . she &apos;ll be fine .
yeah , it looks like i &apos;m gonna be waiting for that tow after all .
i &apos;ll call you back .
i &apos;d planned on doing some repairs ,
but i got short @-@ changed on some copper pipe .
$ 3.00 a pound -- can you believe it ?
look , if i wanted to make small talk , i would visit my barber .
oh , i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t know about that .
what the hell ?
i mean , i don &apos;t trust anybody but me with this mop .
angelo , you swindling son of a bitch , where is my medallion ?
well , it isn &apos;t -- i am staring at an empty briefcase
and a lap full of water !
hey , trouble in paradise ?
i &apos;m meeting you inside . get here now !
delmon !
what &apos;s the problem ?
what do you mean , &quot; what &apos;s the problem &quot; ?
well , the medallion &apos;s melted .
hopefully , this buys us our face @-@ to @-@ face .
i think it did .
where &apos;s my money , man ? where is my money ?
it &apos;s downstairs .
now , that -- that &apos;s clockwork .
let &apos;s go .
you got a medallion downstairs ?
i &apos;m not going downstairs .
let &apos;s go .
the real medallion better be in there .
del ?
* i got harlem on my mind *
all i saw was the briefcase .
out of my way .
angelo , what is this ?
del , don &apos;t be an idiot .
there . you got your medallion ,
i got my money . we good ?
no , you &apos;re not .
fbi . you &apos;re under arrest .
you taking us all in ?
we are . get him out of here .
you &apos;d save yourself some trouble if you tell us what happened .
cuff delmon .
yes , sir .
wait .
no , you don &apos;t have to do that .
agent del had nothing to do with this .
it &apos;s on me .
you put that on record , and your brother will be fine .
you don &apos;t have to cuff him .
let &apos;s take him out the back , let the crowd enjoy the night .
good news .
the tlc is returning all the stolen medallions .
bad news , they have some questions
about the validity of hal hoover &apos;s existence .
don &apos;t worry . i can wait for an appropriate reaction .
after delmon got out of prison ,
all he wanted was to get his old life back .
you do know we &apos;re talking about me right now ?
moz , i know where to take the key .
key .
ugh , sometimes i wish you didn &apos;t do your job so well .
hey , you say &quot; get everything with a new york skyline . &quot;
i supplied .
look . i need caffeine or whiskey .
or both -- irish coffee .
mm . i will kiss you .
on the off chance that caffrey started to move , i set an alert .
where &apos;s he headed ?
talking to angelo made me realize
i &apos;ve been looking at the key all wrong .
so a medallion thief set you straight ?
no . he reminded me of who i was before i went to prison .
10 year ago , ellen and i had no direct communication .
well , she was in witness protection ,
and you were on the lam .
right . we had no relationship .
and we &apos;ve been trying to find a vantage point
that was relevant to her life ,
but she would have been trying to find one
that was relevant to mine .
looks like a pier in queens .
of course .
it &apos;s those damn corks !
come again ?
i should have known .
back then , all ellen knew about neal
was that his time was running out .
i was chasing him .
corks ?
when peter was closing in , i started saving corks .
i &apos;d come down here with a bottle of wine ,
watch the sun set over the city .
each sunset and each cork marked another day i was free .
and you told ellen ?
yeah . the last time i saw her , before i went to prison .
so maybe she figured when you got out ...
i &apos;d pick up where i left off .
right here .
let me guess -- that &apos;s your caffrey box .
everything that didn &apos;t make sense to log into evidence .
you &apos;re saying there &apos;s a cork in there ?
no . he had this ritual with corks .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
but he used to go to this pier in queens --
that pier in queens .
it &apos;s got to be in here . please be in here .
please be here .
hold this .
moz .
it covers everything except one building .
he found it .
he found what ?
she led you to the empire state building .
