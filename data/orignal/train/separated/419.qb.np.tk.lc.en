i believe humanity was born from conflict .
maybe that &apos;s why in all of us lives a dark side .
some of us choose to embrace it .
some have no choice .
the rest of us fight it .
and in the end ,
it &apos;s as natural as the air we breathe .
at some point ,
all of us are forced to face the truth .
ourselves .
for me that day has come .
my god !
you look so beautiful .
no , no , no , don &apos;t cry .
your mascara will bleed .
look at you . so perfect .
my hands ...
i--i can &apos;t feel my hands .
please , cut me loose .
she has that something special
so few have these days , don &apos;t you think ?
what do you want from me ?
what you desire most .
i saw it the moment i set eyes on you .
saw what ?
fame .
you will never look more beautiful than this moment right now .
i was 18 when i faced a man who chose to embrace his dark side ,
and by doing so , he took my humanity .
every day since i have put on a mask
to hide what now suffocates me ...
the truth .
and nothing speaks louder than the truth .
out of the shadows ,
a taxi pulls into the alleyway .
she moves into the light ,
radiant , captivating .
out of the shadows , robert sees her .
never has she looked more beautiful than this moment right now .
there &apos;s a sadness to her .
for a moment , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d come .
i had to .
what is it ?
what if ...
what if all we have
is all we were meant to be ?
no ! no . no .
it &apos;s had . past tense . had .
not have . try it again .
i can &apos;t . not like this .
don &apos;t cry . don &apos;t cry .
otherwise you &apos;ll relieve the audience .
fight back the tears and they &apos;ll cry for you .
untie my hands . let me move .
i &apos;ll get it . i swear .
hold the moment and you hold the audience .
what if all we had
was all we were meant to be ?
my love , oh , my love ,
to my grave i will carry you in my heart .
oh , wait , please !
please , let me try it one more time !
this is all you were ever meant to be .
no , i can do it . i promise .
you &apos;ll never grow old .
no , well , wait , wait . just give me one more chance .
you should leave now .
i can do it ! oh , god .
please , no , let me do it one more time , please .
oh , god , i don &apos;t want to die ! no , no--
melissa crane ?
get out .
alison gardner ?
get out before i call the police .
i called them . and they &apos;ll be here ,
but not before i &apos;m done .
done ?
done with what ?
nine girls you raped and you butchered .
you took from them what you took from me .
but i survived .
you should have killed me , gardner .
detective croft ?
i &apos;ve seen a lot over the years ,
but nothing like this .
like what ?
i didn &apos;t notice it at first ,
but then when i saw it , i knew i had to call you .
look at her face , prentiss .
yep .
i guess you guys have seen it all .
thought i had .
what do you make of it ?
nothing good .
all right , listen , i need wide @-@ angle shots of her body , torso ,
close @-@ ups of her face and her mouth .
whoever did this has a mind i don &apos;t want to understand .
that &apos;s a luxury we can &apos;t afford .
kelly landis went missing 3 days ago .
2 days ago , the georgetown &quot; monitor &quot; received this .
so whoever took this , took kelly .
and wanted the world to know it .
is that you ?
where was she found ?
uh , she was found in georgetown , in an alley ,
late last night .
i sent morgan and prentiss .
only one victim ?
it &apos;s what he did to her that concerns me .
morgan sent these , also late last night .
he and prentiss are waiting in the district .
the body seems posed .
left arm raised ...
oh ... that &apos;s a first . i see your concern .
what ?
a photo wasn &apos;t all he took .
reid , what ?
her lips have been removed .
oh , my god .
maybe a trophy .
maybe he ate them ?
ok , now i have that memory
burned in my mind for the rest of my life .
you asked .
the photo he sent to the &quot; monitor &quot;
and the way her body &apos;s posed and the mutilation ,
it must be a representation of someone .
at least by sending a photo ,
the media &apos;s opened a line of communication .
now that he &apos;s got the media &apos;s attention ,
we can expect more of these .
now for this late @-@ breaking news .
kelly landis was found dumped in an alley late last night .
and i &apos;ve been informed her body was mutilated by the killer .
the fbi &apos;s behavioral analysis unit
has been called in to investigate .
this is taylor conwright , wvdc news .
&quot; fame will go by , and so long i &apos;ve had you , fame .
国会山
&quot; if it goes by . i &apos;ve always known it was fickle ,
&quot; so at least it &apos;s something i experienced ,
but that &apos;s not where i live . &quot;
marilyn monroe .
33 years . 2 days left to retire .
not once did i have my name in print .
now it &apos;s alongside a 22 @-@ year @-@ old girl
left butchered in an alley .
who found her ?
homeless guy .
we need to compile a list of kelly &apos;s direct relatives ,
friends , co @-@ workers , boyfriends , everyone .
when we got the photo ,
i expected a ransom , not a body .
this isn &apos;t about money . it &apos;s about that .
attention .
by sending in the photo ,
the unsub &apos;s handiwork becomes the center of attention .
it wasn &apos;t sent . it was walked into the &quot; monitor &quot; building .
no one saw a thing .
from here on out , nobody talks to the press .
the last thing we need is the media naming her killer .
it &apos;ll have an emotional effect on her killer ,
but positive or negative , neither one will help .
you know , you guys usually work serial murders .
all we have is kelly .
what you have is unique ,
in fact . it &apos;s a first for all of us .
kelly represents someone specific
to the unsub .
love and hate
in equal measure .
what the hell does cutting her lips off represent ?
it &apos;s a fetish , an obsession linked either
to a profoundly deep love or possibly disgust of lips .
as morgan pointed out ,
emotions that are in direct conflict with one another .
it &apos;s his signature .
and not one that &apos;s on any database .
i love to sit and watch people go by .
you can tell a lot by the way someone walks .
the way they hold their head .
take that lady over there ...
the blonde with the ponytail ,
in the gray dress . you see her ?
that one ?
no , no , no . don &apos;t point . that &apos;s rude .
that is not a walk .
she &apos;s keeping her head down
and avoiding eye contact . you know why ?
no .
everyone &apos;s in her way .
she &apos;s either late for something or ...
mad at the world .
mad at the world .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve always told you , rhett ,
never have children .
i &apos;m going to go buy some flowers .
you see that , how she glides ,
you can &apos;t take your eyes off her ?
how do you walk ?
i can show you .
i &apos;d like that .
the office for the georgetown &quot; monitor &quot; is here on m street .
kelly &apos;s body was found in rykers alley here .
3 blocks west is where he hand @-@ delivered kelly &apos;s photo .
and 10 blocks farther east
are offices of practically every major media outlet .
why choose the &quot; monitor &quot; ?
he reads it or it &apos;s his comfort zone .
you think he lives in georgetown ?
until we find signs of sexual assault ,
we can &apos;t be sure it &apos;s a he .
it says that kelly lives in alexandria
but she works on the hill . is that correct ?
she didn &apos;t have a chance . it was her first day as a senate page .
what time was she supposed to report for work ?
9 a.m. neighbors saw her leave in the morning .
she didn &apos;t have a car .
she used the bus or the metro ,
no one saw her .
can we see a copy of the autopsy report ?
happening downstairs as we speak .
and we &apos;d like to see a list of everyone
you &apos;ve interviewed so far .
it &apos;s on my desk . i &apos;ll get it .
kelly &apos;s body was dumped in the district .
it &apos;s likely that she was abducted and killed here , too .
then he &apos;s local .
and mpd &apos;s done a comprehensive neighborhood canvass .
they have .
they &apos;ve probably already interviewed the unsub .
that &apos;s a great walk .
really quite wonderful .
my mother says ,
when you &apos;re a movie star ,
you have to have a walk .
&apos;cause when you &apos;re on a screen 15 feet high ,
you better have a good walk .
and when you win that oscar ,
you gotta walk across that red carpet like you own it .
stunning .
you think so ?
no , i think you &apos;re an ugly little girl
who has nothing to give to the world .
mommy !
if she was offered food or water ,
she didn &apos;t accept it .
her stomach &apos;s empty , and she &apos;s dehydrated .
not that she could have accepted anything .
she was restrained .
dr. hecht , did you find any signs of sexual abuse ?
no .
cause of death ?
suffocation .
but not manual strangulation .
was the mutilation post- or antemortem ?
post .
never get used to that .
there &apos;s something in her throat .
9 a.m. is a busy time of day to be abducting someone .
if she didn &apos;t know who took her , that &apos;s high @-@ risk .
well , maybe agent hotchner and the whiz kid are wrong .
maybe she was brought into the district by somebody she knew .
no one &apos;s going to bring a victim into d.c.
unless their base of operations is here .
this is definitely his comfort zone .
ok , so day one , kelly &apos;s abducted .
day 2 , the media gets a photo of her .
day 3 , her body &apos;s found here posed .
this all feels orchestrated .
well , if you orchestrated all of this ,
wouldn &apos;t you want to see it ?
why else leave a body here ?
i &apos;ll get one of my men to film the crowd .
morgan , isn &apos;t this crime scene sealed off ?
there &apos;s someone in here .
the air must have dislodged it ,
otherwise i &apos;d have seen it .
thanks .
a page from a book ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s old paper .
the blood and the saliva has sort of smudged the words .
there &apos;s a lot of text .
it appears ... to be in old courier .
you know what ?
it &apos;s typed , not printed .
&quot; nothing moves in the street .
&quot; a cool breeze and gentle rain
&quot; do little to silence robert &apos;s beating heart . &quot;
from the time kelly was found ,
how long had she been dead ?
lividity indicates half an hour .
georgetown &apos;s where he kept her captive .
trihalomethane was found in her hair .
chloroform ?
who uses chloroform nowadays ?
you know , chloroform , the glamour shots--
it all feels like a throwback to another century .
where were you last night ?
jail .
there was a homeless man here ,
6 feet tall , beard , late 40s .
impossible .
no , there was definitely somebody right here last night .
this place is my place .
this alley &apos;s my home .
ain &apos;t nobody down here but me .
do we have a problem here ?
the homeless guy who found kelly &apos;s body , where is he ?
he was right here .
he flagged down a patrol car and he brought them back here .
you mind if i take a look ?
do i have a choice ?
did you write that on the wall ?
son of a bitch wrote on my walls !
no , no , hey , hey ! don &apos;t touch that , please , sir .
sir , that is evidence that we need .
come here .
please .
&quot; robert hangs in the shadows ,
&quot; just as his life now hangs in the balance .
but life without love is no life at all . &quot;
we would be awesome together .
aren &apos;t we already ?
like us , they are perfectly matched ,
but the are not found on any database .
on what , then ?
on that piece of paper found shoved down kelly &apos;s throat .
the same words ?
mm @-@ hmm . yeah .
derek , what is it ? you &apos;re doing that silence .
it means you &apos;re onto something .
i &apos;ll call you back .
hotch was right .
you have interviewed the unsub .
how do you know that ?
because the writing on the wall is the same
as what was stuffed down kelly &apos;s throat .
the homeless man who found kelly &apos;s body
wasn &apos;t homeless .
excuse me ?
he was wearing a disguise .
read to me , rhett .
you know i love it when you read to me .
i &apos;m tired .
i &apos;m so tired .
rhett ,
come upstairs and read to me .
scene 43 .
you know how i love the way you play it .
oh , i can &apos;t sleep when you don &apos;t read to me .
baby , i need you .
coming , mom .
just a minute .
just a minute , i &apos;m nearly done .
get up here now !
rhett ?
rhett .
&quot; agents of the bau investigate the hill ripper . &quot;
why are they saying these things ?
you &apos;re so much like your father was .
really ?
tell me . please .
you &apos;re weak .
what ?
you &apos;re weak just like he was .
i did this .
not you ! not my father !
a few bad words from the press and look at you .
&quot; why are they saying all these things about me ? &quot;
he was gutless and he was pathetic ,
but at least your father knew how to walk like a man !
he gave you nothing .
i &apos;ve given you my life !
and i am reminded of that every day .
oh , please ! don &apos;t say that !
do you have any idea what you have cost me ?
what i could have been ? !
she looks so much like me .
but she &apos;s not you , mom .
look at her .
look at her , mom !
is that the work of a weak man ?
in a matter of hours , she &apos;ll be more famous than you ever were .
i can &apos;t match the words , sir ,
but if they &apos;re from a film , it &apos;s got to be the 1950s .
are you sure ?
well , the picture that he sent of kelly to the &quot; monitor , &quot;
kelly &apos;s makeup , ok ,
the foundation is like a pearl color .
and over it is this green powder .
that powder gives it a whiter look .
her eyebrows are plucked .
her cheeks are that flushed rose hue that is totally that era .
but what really seals it is the dark eyeliner .
she has bedroom eyes .
that was marilyn monroe &apos;s trademark .
well , if kelly &apos;s supposed to represent monroe ,
then the text we found may be from one of monroe &apos;s movies .
yeah , i know , it &apos;s not much , but ...
no , no , no , it helps the profile .
sir ...
garcia , i &apos;m sorry if i embarrassed you
when i asked about your play .
i certainly didn &apos;t mean to .
oh , oh , i know . i just , um ...
really , i gotta ask you that you don &apos;t
share that with anyone , please .
of course .
oh , and one other thing .
i was thinking , kelly was missing for 3 days ,
and most stories-- plays and films--
i know , have a 3 @-@ act structure .
not unlike your play .
you know , i saw the original production in new york .
well , we sort of adapted it .
good .
thanks .
penny hanley , 19 . she lives in arlington ,
works in an art gallery .
yesterday she didn &apos;t make it to work or back home .
she caught the metro to union station .
her father dropped her off .
her purse was found a few blocks away on a side street .
it &apos;s most likely where she was abducted .
kelly was taken for 3 days .
if he &apos;s holding to pattern , penny &apos;s already on day 2 .
today the georgetown &quot; monitor &quot;
will receive a photo .
whatever happens , we cannot allow another photograph
like kelly &apos;s to be published .
we need to get ahead of the media .
they &apos;ve already named him &quot; the hill ripper . &quot;
i want undercover units to lock that building down .
and if you see him , let him walk in .
do not apprehend him before .
we &apos;re looking for a white male in his mid to late 40s ,
approximately 6 feet tall , slim build .
we think he &apos;s a local and a loner ,
and he &apos;s most likely unemployed .
he &apos;s moving his victims around the city unseen ,
so we know he has a vehicle .
it &apos;s probably an older model , but well maintained .
what does he think this is ?
a page from what we believe is a script
was found inserted in kelly &apos;s throat .
somehow in the unsub &apos;s mind ,
kelly seems to have failed expectations .
although there were no sexual interactions
ante or postmortem ,
the removal of the lips is in itself a sexual act .
a behavior which tells us we &apos;re dealing
with a borderline personality .
based on the obvious theatricality of the case ,
we think he worked in or around the arts .
3 days may represent a 3 @-@ act play , of which kelly was the star .
kelly was killed 3 days after she was abducted .
that means penny may only have a day left .
look up .
oops . i missed one .
oh , yeah .
wowza .
you want to see ?
i just want to go home .
trust me .
i &apos;ve had a lot of practice .
you look great .
what do you think ?
you like it ?
she didn &apos;t have it .
i thought she did , but she didn &apos;t .
you have it in spades , my dear .
i don &apos;t want to be famous .
we all want to be famous .
this building has 3 exits--
north , south , and west .
you &apos;re here to target a woman ,
but you don &apos;t want to attract attention .
well , standing in the middle
gawking at passing women , would certainly attract attention .
like you &apos;re doing now .
what &apos;s that ?
just like that , i.q. of 187 is slashed to 60 .
but sitting and reading the paper
would give him an excuse to watch
without being noticed .
far enough away not to attract attention
but close enough to make sure she &apos;s the right one .
you know , she works 15 blocks east of here .
her father said she walked through this train station every day .
if he were sitting here ,
he &apos;s on camera .
how many cameras cover the area ?
3 , but only 2 are operable-- cameras 8 and 7 .
can you go back to yesterday around 4 p.m. ?
ok , camera 7 . there she is .
can you bring up camera 8 ?
can you enlarge it and keep it rolling , please ?
see the girl walking in front of the man ?
well , he &apos;s seen penny . look .
can you go back to the exact moment that he sat down ?
freeze it right there .
from the moment that he left the station ,
he sat there for over 3 hours .
we profiled he has his own vehicle .
it was the only way he could abduct penny off the street .
3 hours exceeds any parking meter .
get all this footage to garcia .
this is where her purse was found .
this has to be where he grabbed her .
high @-@ risk but possible .
chloroform &apos;s old @-@ school , but it &apos;s quick .
they got the guy on tape stalking penny .
they have an i.d. on him ?
not yet . hotch seems to think
that he may have some type of parking permit .
this entire street is parking permit only .
well , maybe he has some kind of work permit .
a guy like this can &apos;t hold down a job .
a resident permit would give him all the time he needed .
permits go by zone .
then we need to shut this area down .
this is where he lives .
oh , god , oh , god , oh , god !
i want to get this scene on its feet .
to do that , you &apos;ll need these .
my toes are pushing at the end .
i need some that will fit .
i can do this barefoot .
it &apos;ll be quieter . you don &apos;t want to wake your mother , do you ?
good thinking .
some of the lines are missing .
we &apos;ll remember them , won &apos;t we ?
every ... last ... word .
your lips are so beautiful .
what &apos;s the scene mean to you ?
love .
such extraordinary love .
for a moment , i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d come .
i had to .
tonight begins the rest of our lives .
what is it ?
i can &apos;t do this .
of course you can .
i &apos;ve got the tickets .
the train is coming .
we &apos;re going to make it .
i &apos;m not so sure .
what is it , my sweet ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
everything &apos;s going to be all right .
what if what we had was all we were meant to be ?
my love ,
oh , my love ,
to the grave i will carry you in my heart .
help me !
somebody help me , please !
help me !
somebody help me !
you broke my nose ! god !
help me ! somebody help me !
no ! no --
you sick son of a bitch !
no !
you were right .
your toes were too long .
we closed off this entire area .
cops are all over it .
they &apos;re going door to door
where it &apos;s a 5 @-@ block @-@ radius with over 2,000 homes .
unless they get lucky , that could take days .
undercover units have staked out
the georgetown &quot; monitor &quot; building .
garcia , anything on the footage ?
lab is analyzing it frame by frame ,
but it was pretty clear
he doesn &apos;t know those cameras are on him .
permits ?
cross @-@ checking with the profile ,
we &apos;ve got male , late 40s ,
truck , van , or suv .
that brings it down to 600 potentials .
garcia , what zone covers rykers alley --
m street and charlotte street ?
two zones .
no , that doesn &apos;t help .
well , come on , i &apos;m the high priestess of all things digital ,
but i &apos;m not a god .
what permit covers all zones ?
only one . disabled .
this guy isn &apos;t disabled .
maybe he knows someone who is .
a kid on a bmx dropped this off
at the &quot; monitor &quot; a half hour ago .
said a bum gave him 20 bucks .
well , at least it didn &apos;t make the news .
it buys us some time , right ?
until he finds another way to contact the media .
we &apos;ll do it for him .
garcia , i need you here as soon as possible .
sure . what for ?
we need him to break cover , get out in the open .
call a press conference
with every major media outlet present .
oh , i am not the one you want in front of that camera .
yes , you are . detective , we need every available unit .
hey . you &apos;re gonna be fine .
no , i will not be fine . i will suck .
i will suck . and what happens then ?
penelope . penelope , stop it .
we just gotta buy some time to get ahead of this guy .
he &apos;ll be watching , you mean ?
i &apos;m gonna be right by your side .
now get your butt over here .
oh , my god .
every great movie star has a walk .
that &apos;s something you &apos;ll never have .
sir , i &apos;ve thought about this
and i &apos;ve decided it &apos;s a bad idea .
all you have to do is stay calm .
don &apos;t let the room control you .
how am i supposed to do that ?
keep your answers short and to the point .
don &apos;t comment on the kelly landis case .
keep the focus on penny .
no , sir , i don &apos;t think you understand .
i have a phobia about
having a video camera even pointed at me .
i get all nervous and i start to panic
and i forget what i &apos;m gonna say
and my hands get all sweaty
and then my hands start to shake .
my hands are shaking right now .
i cannot do things i am not good at ,
and i am not good at being in a room full of strange people .
that &apos;s why i stay in a room 6 by 9 feet .
i feel safe there .
garcia , what about the tolgate theater ?
tolgate theater ?
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a small repertory theater in dean street
where they do a lot of -- - reid , we know what it is .
that is not the same thing .
garcia -- - i--
i can &apos;t even look at you right now .
i am mad . i asked you not to say anything .
we need him to see a face and a look that he recognizes .
well , he likes blondes , and i &apos;m red now .
we can change that .
toward the end , morgan &apos;s gonna hand you a note .
take a moment , let the group settle ...
and when you have everyone &apos;s attention ,
read it out .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you &apos;ll be great , red .
hey . this isn &apos;t about the unsub .
it &apos;s about the girls . for him ,
it &apos;s all about making penny famous .
then aren &apos;t we helping him realize his dream ?
come on .
we get this right , we end that dream .
the press is calling him the hill ripper .
they &apos;re gonna want to
sensationalize this story even further .
now , they &apos;re gonna ask you how long he kept kelly .
they &apos;re gonna ask you how she died .
did he stab her ? did he torture her ?
did he rape her ?
how many others has he killed ?
garcia , you have to make it about penny .
you let whoever has her know
that the entire world is watching ,
and then you make penny the star .
all we gotta do is get this guy to move .
you can do this , baby girl .
give me your bag .
ok .
penny hanley went missing 2 days ago .
we have received over 3,000 calls .
her family is obviously deeply worried
and is looking forward to her prompt and safe return .
isn &apos;t penny hanley yet another victim of the hill ripper ?
right now , all we know is that penny is missing .
who sent that photo in
just like the kelly landis case ?
we &apos;d like to take this opportunity
to reach out to the public .
penny was last seen here ,
leaving union station .
you mean she was taken by the hill ripper .
rumors are that kelly landis was found
with her lips cut off .
we are not prepared to discuss the details of kelly &apos;s case .
isn &apos;t the mutilation , if fact , what you call a signature ?
penny hanley &apos;s name has captured the attention
of not only the nation , but also the entire world .
this photo is the most recent image ...
you hear that ? the whole world knows who you are .
we believe it was taken and sent by the person ...
i &apos;m so thirsty . i need water .
she never got that kind of attention .
they love you .
penny hanley .
the whole world knows your name .
i want to say something . i want to say
something to the sick son of a bitch that has my daughter .
mr. hanley , we all want to find your daughter ,
daddy .
but you really need to calm down .
let daddy talk . come on , daddy ,
i want to hear what you have to say about this little girl .
mr. hanley , don &apos;t do this .
you know , i say something , she dies ,
i plead for her life , she dies .
i don &apos;t have any money , my wife passed away 2 years ago .
she is all i have , and if this sick bastard gets away with this--
just let me say something .
taylor conwright , wcdc news .
prentiss and reid are moving north down m street .
what would you like to say to the man who has your daughter ?
she &apos;s losing the room . morgan &apos;s gotta do this now .
if the hill ripper is watching , what would you tell him ?
i hope this works .
the m.e. said .
kelly was killed only a half an hour before she was dumped .
that means he must have killed her in his car .
my little girl right now is in your hands .
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right .
she is in my hands .
and what did you do ? nothing .
maybe she &apos;s already with god .
either way , your life will be in my hands .

the photo--it &apos;s exactly the same as kelly and penny .

1956 . it &apos;s a set photo from a movie called
&quot; reflection of desire . &quot;
may was 19 when this was taken .
she &apos;s got to be over 70 by now .
yeah . m street , rykers alley ,
they were all locations on this film .
it was the only movie she ever made , and ...
she was 4 months pregnant when this picture was taken .
which ended her career .
and the father ?
co @-@ star .
derek , do you think she made her son do all of this ?
penelope , i think she made her son do a lot more than this .
rhett walden , this is the police !
we know you &apos;re in there .
come out with your hands up .
you hear that , mommy ?
they &apos;re calling for us .
i told you this day would come .
you didn &apos;t believe it .
but here it is .
are you ready ?
i &apos;m ready , my sweet love .
this is the police .

rossi .
her lips .
they &apos;re kelly &apos;s .
here .
oh , what a gentleman .
excuse me , missy , but when did you
plan on telling me ?
oh , i wasn &apos;t gonna tell you .
we all have things for ourselves .
you know , you have property , i have the theater .
can you at least tell me what it &apos;s about ?
mm @-@ hmm . it &apos;s about a woman who &apos;s attacked by a serial killer .
but she catches him and she knocks him out ,
and she keeps him for days .
garcia , of all the plays in the world ,
you choose something like that ?
i get to vent .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
how does it end ?
if i told you that , it wouldn &apos;t be a surprise ,
would it ?
i believe humanity was born from conflict .
maybe that &apos;s why in all of us lives a dark side .
some of us embrace it .
some have no choice .
the rest of us fight it .
in the end ,
it &apos;s as natural as the air we breathe .
at some point ,
we &apos;re forced to face the truth .
