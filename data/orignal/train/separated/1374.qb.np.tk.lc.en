are you enjoying your new place ?
you know .
the professor &apos;s taste is a little dark and masculine ,
but it kind of suits you .
thank you .
this looks more like a squad room than a home .
yeah .
jane , you need a break .
i mean , a home is a refuge a place
where you &apos;re supposed to get away from your problems .
till some psycho burns it down .
i brought breakfast .
okay .
a delicious quinoa , zucchini , and chia @-@ seed quiche .
i &apos;d rather eat the bag .
the quiche is for me .
and i got you a glazed twist .
you -- really ?
okay , well , you keep bringing doughnuts ,
you can pop by anytime .
hey , did you go to the doctor ?
i did . no change .
well , that &apos;s good , right ?
it is .
no further cognitive loss .
i &apos;m experiencing a little dizziness , but , um ...
whose house is this ?
really ?
i pranked you .
you believed me .
i pranked you and you believed me .
i did .
i really did .
i can &apos;t believe you kept that up for an hour .
i know .
wait , have -- i &apos;ve been here for an hour ?
it &apos;s o &apos;connell .
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
dr. isles .
wait , did detective o &apos;connell find something ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re tailing somebody that they think is alice &apos;s money man .
okay , i &apos;ll lock up .
okay , thanks .
‭ i am on my way right now .
dr. isles .
detective .
are you leading the investigation ?
this is my first as primary
for the fatal accident investigation team .
well , good for you . you deserve it .
watch your step .
thank you .
the victim is layla jalbani , freshman at pemberton college .
i &apos;m not sure what she was doing up here .
there &apos;s no alcohol or drugs in the vehicle .
and i didn &apos;t notice any skid marks .
there weren &apos;t any .
it &apos;s like she didn &apos;t even try to brake .
well , maybe the brakes weren &apos;t working .
she had to have been going pretty fast
to smash through the guardrail .
it &apos;s an older car , so no airbag or structural support .
she didn &apos;t stand a chance .
her head hit the steering wheel at a high velocity .
cause of death appears to be traumatic brain injury .
so ... an accident ?
i don &apos;t see anything else to make me think otherwise .
we &apos;ll just do a full work @-@ up of the vehicle
and check the driver for drugs and alcohol .
but first , we need to contact the family .
should i do the notification ?
i &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s part of the job , right ?
this is the guy we &apos;ve been watching .
his name is marvin holtz .
he &apos;s a high @-@ end cpa that we &apos;ve connected
to some of sands &apos; shell corps .
we suspect holtz is the financial brains behind her operation .
how long &apos;s he been here ?
about a half hour .
there &apos;s no reason a guy like that
should be visiting a dump like this .
all right , well , if alice sands is up there ,
she &apos;s not gonna come quietly .
we &apos;ve got guys at every exit .
she &apos;s not going anywhere .
maybe you should let us handle this .
you don &apos;t want to go in there angry .
i &apos;m not angry .
i &apos;m way past angry .
‭ gun !
you okay ?
yeah , thanks .
clear !
clear !
the place is empty .
she &apos;s not here .
then what the hell was he doing here ?
making a withdrawal .
we didn &apos;t get alice , but we got her money .
layla &apos;s parents ?
they just drove in from springfield .
i had to do that --
identify marcus after he died .
that must have been awful .
yeah . you keep telling yourself it can &apos;t be real .
sometimes i forget that you went through that .
well , i &apos;m doing better at putting it behind me .
i think you &apos;re doing great .
you must arrest him . he must pay .
look , look . look what he &apos;s done to our girl .
amir , amir .
he must pay .
amir , please !
hey , hey , hey .
he won &apos;t get away with this !
what &apos;s going on , here ?
he killed her .
he killed my layla .
apparently layla &apos;s life was threatened recently .
the jalbanis don &apos;t believe that the car wreck was an accident .
they believe their daughter was murdered .
layla was to be the first in our family
to graduate from university .
you must have been proud .
she worked so hard .
too hard , maybe .
i mean , she was sheltered .
i mean , that &apos;s why she took up with that snake .
he took advantage .
layla was smart , but she was also very naive .
this ex @-@ boyfriend of hers , what was his name ?
brian mcdonald .
he was older than her , and he had been in jail .
they met a few months ago .
right away , we could see the changes in her .
we begged layla to stop seeing him .
she had such a bright future in front of her .
she was going to do great things .
so , layla ended the relationship with brian ?
she came to see us right after .
she was so upset .
he threatened her .
he said he would kill her .
mr. jalbani , from what we know ,
layla died in a car accident .
brian mcdonald is a mechanic ,
and he worked on layla &apos;s car all the time when they were together .
he could have done something to the engine or cut the brakes .
if layla &apos;s car was tampered with , we &apos;ll figure it out .
you have my word .
the bullet passed between the clavicle and first rib .
it struck and perforated the right peronial vein
and the right thoracic artery .
the bullet then went through the apex of the upper lobe of the lung .
is there a problem ?
it &apos;s just that you said the peronial vein , which is ...
in the leg -- i know where the peronial vein is .
brachiocephalic -- the brachiocephalic vein .
i must be tired .
‭ hey , did you get anything on the cpa ?
yes . cause of death --
his gunshot wounds to the stomach and the chest .
yes , i know . i was there for that part .
is there anything that i can use ?
okay , do you always stare at her like that ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s just creepy .
i could stare at you instead , if you like .
i did find one thing unusual .
the victim was shot from the front ,
but i noticed red droplets
on the back of both his neck and his shirt .
well , how &apos;d the blood get back there ?
not blood -- bovine myoglobin .
it comes from beef that &apos;s already been drained of blood .
i analyzed those droplets ,
and the size and shape indicate that they could have come from a
a cutting saw .
so holtz could have been in a butcher shop
or a slaughterhouse -- something like that ?
possibly .
okay . thanks .
uh , jane , wait .
when &apos;s the last time you had a meal ?
jane , if you want to catch alice sands ,
you have to be at your best ,
which means taking care of your body
and finding ways to relieve the stress .
okay , i &apos;ll eat something later .
right now , i need to find a connection between a cpa and dead cows .
layla &apos;s ex works at an auto @-@ repair shop over on bellflower .
any priors ?
oh , a couple of drunk and disorderlies -- nothing serious .
any indication he messed with her car ?
uh , maura says it was so damaged that there &apos;s no way to be sure .
i talked to her roommate at the college .
she said layla seemed stressed out lately ,
but they weren &apos;t close .
layla wasn &apos;t even around that much .
well , i &apos;ll talk to the ex tomorrow .
here you go . sorry for the wait .
thanks .
can i get you guys anything else ?
thousand island .
thousand island .
jinx .
jinx .
hey , nina , how &apos;s your shoulder healing ?
still hurts , but it &apos;s not slowing me down .
what about you ? i heard about ron .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , thank you .
the rizzolis aren &apos;t doing so hot
in relationships this week , are we ?
well , we &apos;ve done better , ma .
i broke things off with nicole , so ...
i thought you really liked her .
yeah , she &apos;s nice , you know ?
yeah , it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just , you know , i realized --
you know what ? i &apos;ll get that thousand island dressing for you guys .
thanks , ma .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m really sorry , detective .
it &apos;s a total loss .
jane !
you all right ?
yeah .
yeah .
maura just said that --
that i should find some ways to relieve stress , so ...
yeah , we all should .
yeah .
okay , well , i &apos;m gonna -- i &apos;m gonna get dressed .
jane .
yeah ?
when we find sands , what are you gonna do ?
whatever &apos;s necessary .
what &apos;s up ? you find something ?
not really .
i cross @-@ referenced marvin holtz &apos;s known associates .
no connection to a butcher shop or anything like that .
closest thing i found was a deli on east concord .
holtz &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law owns it .
east concord ?
that mean something to you ?
yeah .
uh , when the drug @-@ unit guys were following holtz ,
he would stop every day for a bagel at the same place
on east concord . newsom &apos;s .
that &apos;s the brother @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s place ,
but it &apos;s not a bagel shop . it &apos;s a deli .
call o &apos;connell . tell him to meet us there .
what is this ? you can &apos;t just come in here .
sir , i ask you to step aside .
back &apos;s clear .
upstairs .
copy .
go for it .
alice sands , you &apos;re under arrest .
so it seems .
we &apos;ve got her , jane . it &apos;s over .
she &apos;s trying to get inside your head .
alice is a master manipulator ,
like charles manson or jim jones .
she has the instinct of finding vulnerabilities and exploiting them .
well , good luck with that .
i mean , we found her red @-@ handed with the rifle that shot nina .
we don &apos;t know that yet .
jane , can we talk ?
well , we read her her rights and she &apos;s asked to talk .
wha-- you heard her .
jane , don &apos;t .
you &apos;re giving her what she wants .
i remember you so well from the police academy .
you loved being the best .
you loved making everyone else look bad .
that all was in your head .
i think there &apos;s a lot of crazy shit in your head .
i &apos;m curious , though .
you had a successful drug network
that you kept under the radar for years .
why would you risk all of that just to come after me ?
the thing about prison is it gives you time to think
- to examine your life .
i finally understood that the path of my life
would have been completely different if it weren &apos;t for you .
we barely knew each other .
you stole what should have been mine .
i came from a family of cops .
everyone should have looked up to me ,
not some plumber &apos;s daughter .
you know what i remember about you ?
tell me .
nothing .
the law -- this whole notion of right and wrong --
you &apos;ve given your whole life to it , haven &apos;t you ?
i have .
what good has it done ?
you &apos;re alone .
you &apos;ve been through hell .
you &apos;ve endangered your family and friends .
all that sacrifice --
has anything really changed ?
have you actually accomplished anything ?
i &apos;m putting you behind bars . that feels pretty good .
how will that change anything ?
these crimes that you &apos;re accusing me of orchestrating --
they all started when i was in jail .
so , if i was involved ...
why would prison stop me ?
her attorney &apos;s here .
hi . phillip dayton .
are the cuffs really necessary ?
they didn &apos;t match .
the ballistics ?
i ran the tests twice to be certain .
the rifle that jane found next to alice sands
is not the one that shot nina .
so we still don &apos;t have a single piece of physical evidence
to tie her to the shooting ?
i &apos;ll make sure nothing that was said in this room is admissible .
this conversation &apos;s over .
we were done anyway .
goodbye , jane .
i really enjoyed our chat .
brian mcdonald ?
yeah ?
i &apos;m detective frank rizzoli . i need to ask you a few questions .
you dated a young woman named layla jalbani , right ?
if she said i did anything to her , she &apos;s lying .
what makes you think she &apos;d say that ?
look , i lost my temper , all right ? it was stupid .
but i called her . i told her i was sorry for being a jerk .
she said she understood .
i &apos;m investigating a car accident that layla was involved in .
is she okay ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry . she didn &apos;t make it .
oh , man .
no .
i told her she shouldn &apos;t be driving that car .
yeah , i heard you worked on her car .
wait , did her parents say something ?
did they say i did something to her car ?
i &apos;d never hurt layla .
i loved her , and she loved me .
and her parents -- now , they were the problem .
what kind of problem ?
uh -- uh , you know , she was always trying to ,
uh -- to live up to this image they had of her .
and then she -- she started having trouble in school .
i thought layla was an excellent student .
i just -- i -- i know things were , uh --
they were getting tough for her lately .
you know , you might want to , uh --
you might want to talk to her best friend , carmen .
she knew layla better than anyone .
all right .
well , thanks , brian .
yeah .
we &apos;ll be in touch if we need anything .
it &apos;s bullshit -- an indictment should be a slam @-@ dunk .
i know , but phillip dayton knows how to work the system .
he convinced the judge to hold a probable cause hearing .
well , we have enough for probable cause , right ?
i watched her hand that guy a gun
and tell him to shoot that kid .
and i &apos;ll have you testify to that .
i just wish we had some physical evidence
that tied sands to either dr. isles &apos; kidnapping
or the murder of that trooper in maine .
but your testimony will put sands behind bars ,
at least for a while .
i still can &apos;t believe layla &apos;s gone .
these were all her things ?
yeah .
she kept stuff at my dorm .
she studied there a lot .
her roommate always had people over .
well , i spoke to her ex @-@ boyfriend , brian .
he said she was having a hard time .
she flunked a couple of tests , which really upset her .
and , i mean , everything just kind of snowballed .
you know , she was failing three classes .
any idea what the issue was ?
i think it was too much pressure for her .
she freaked out .
do you mind if i hold on to this ?
keep it all . looking at it just makes me really sad .
dr. isles , i just took a call
for you from dr. halperin .
yes , thank you .
i know dr. halperin .
he specializes in traumatic brain injury .
uh , yes , that &apos;s correct .
i had some questions about the layla jalbani case .
no , you didn &apos;t .
maura , please .
whatever this is , you can trust me .
i can help you .
the night of the shooting , i suffered a subdural hematoma .
it &apos;s stable ,
but there has been some slight cognitive loss .
any further loss of consciousness , nausea ?
slurred speech , trouble walking ?
no .
right . well , that &apos;s good , then .
so , what can i do ?
no one can know -- not yet .
right now , i need the lab focused on finding
the evidence to put alice sands away forever .
understood .
but just so we &apos;re clear ,
my focus is also gonna be on helping you .
your honor , we have ample evidence against alice sands .
in particular , the sworn testimony
of veteran homicide detective jane rizzoli .
detective rizzoli &apos;s testimony can &apos;t be trusted , your honor .
she &apos;s hounded my client with accusations ,
but has yet to produce a single shred of physical proof .
alice sands is a convicted criminal .
they initially charged my client
with the shooting of a police officer last week .
then they just dropped those charges
because the ballistics on the rifle didn &apos;t match .
we have witnesses inside the tunnel who can confirm
sands ordered the shooting of one of her employees .
what witnesses ?
your honor , i have in my hand signed affidavits
of every single person at that scene .
this is not happening .
it &apos;s not over yet .
they all say the same thing .
ms. sands never gave that disturbed young man a gun ,
and , in fact , begged him not to pull the trigger .
ms. lynne , do you have any evidence to present
other than detective rizzoli &apos;s testimony ?
no , your honor , but detective rizzoli has --
then i have no choice .
now , you can refile if you get something stronger .
but until then , i find there was
not probable cause for the arrest .
the defendant is free to go .
you got to find some way to hold her .
give me 48 hours at least .
i &apos;ll do what i can ,
but if it looks like harassment ,
the judge will just throw it out .
i &apos;m sorry .
so , the whole break @-@ up with nicole ,
it was kind of sudden , wasn &apos;t it ?
not really .
we &apos;re just ... different , that &apos;s all .
really ?
ma , nicole was fun , but , i don &apos;t know ,
we &apos;re just not right for each other .
i just wonder if it &apos;s
because there &apos;s somebody else you might like --
somebody who likes french fries
and thousand island dressing as much as you do .
nina ?
no .
maybe .
but nothing can come of it .
why not ? she &apos;s great .
yeah , she &apos;s great , but she &apos;s my friend and we work together .
a million things could go wrong .
so you &apos;re not even gonna try ?
look , maybe it works , maybe it doesn &apos;t .
but if you don &apos;t take a risk ,
how the hell are you ever gonna know ?
ma .
what ?
turn it up .
i don &apos;t know why detective rizzoli
continues to persecute me .
i &apos;m just thankful that justice was done here today .
i really hate that bitch .
this whole affair calls jane rizzoli &apos;s
record into question .
how many times has she targeted innocent victims
with her wild accusations ?
the boston police department needs to launch
a full @-@ scale investigation of detective rizzoli .
nobody &apos;s gonna buy that garbage .
this woman has gone after my home , my friends , my job .
and now she &apos;s going after my reputation ?
so what do you want to do ?
keep digging .
okay , the only place that alice has made a real mistake
is here .
shooting of that state trooper up in maine ?
yeah , that &apos;s our best shot
at getting physical evidence against her .
well , they &apos;ve kept me updated .
so far , no murder weapon has been recovered .
they &apos;re still looking for the gold plymouth the shooter was in .
and alice &apos;s dna could be in that car ,
that would tie her to the murder .
troopers have not made much progress .
well , let &apos;s make it for them .
you look like you could use this .
you here all night ?
yes .
i have been just going over every scrap
of information we have on alice sands
just hoping to find something i missed .
but , uh , i texted you because of the accident investigation .
did you look at layla &apos;s notebook ?
i did , and you were right .
the formulas that layla calculated
correspond almost exactly to the crash data .
so it wasn &apos;t an accident .
well , i built a reconstruction scenario using the formulas
that you found in layla &apos;s notebook .
the 54 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour speed she calculated combined
with the friction value of the road
and the impact angle would create
enough velocity to break the guardrail .
there weren &apos;t skid marks because she was accelerating .
well , there &apos;s no way to tell for certain .
layla drove off that cliff
and made it look like an accident .
she killed herself .
that &apos;s one theory , but none of this is conclusive .
and , frankie , there &apos;s no way to truly know
what was going on in layla &apos;s mind .
what if she never got to route 16 ?
what if she took , like , this road here ?
well , the troopers searched
these woods and this little lake .
nothing .
where does this one go ?
looks like a dead end .
okay .
yeah , it &apos;s just a dirt road .
it just ends in these woods right here .
what is this ? this isn &apos;t on the map .
is that like a crater or something ?
it &apos;s covered in vegetation . it looks like an old quarry .
did the troopers check it out ?
it &apos;s not in the notes .
i &apos;ll get them to take a look .
there you are . i texted you .
i &apos;m sorry . i just needed some time to figure this out .
you talk to maura ?
yeah , it looks like layla crashed her car on purpose .
there &apos;s no definitive proof , but it might be a suicide .
there is proof .
this is what i wanted to show you .
see the reflector there on the guardrail ?
there shouldn &apos;t be any red reflectors
along that stretch of road .
department of transit only uses yellow reflectors .
layla put them there so she &apos;d know exactly where to hit .
if the initial impact didn &apos;t kill her ,
the boulder at the bottom definitely would .
it &apos;s senseless .
s @-@ she was just a kid .
hard to imagine things are so terrible
this seems like the only way out .
well , now i have to explain all this to her parents .
you can &apos;t explain --
maybe no one can .
all you can do is tell them the truth .
you &apos;ll be fine .
i can &apos;t .
oh , yeah , yeah .
i -- i &apos;m sorry . nina , don &apos;t --
oh , god .
you got somebody watching the back ?
okay , let me know if she moves .
you got sands under surveillance ?
she &apos;s not getting away this time .
frankie , mr. and mrs. jalbani are here .
they &apos;re downstairs .
okay . thanks .
‭ what &apos;s going on between you two ?
nothing .
it sure felt like something .
i &apos;m just preoccupied .
i &apos;m trying to figure out how much
to tell layla jalbani &apos;s parents .
do you know what happened ?
yeah .
the more i think about it , the more pissed off i get .
this bright , young girl killed herself instead
of admitting that she &apos;s failing out of college .
even worse -- she makes it look like an accident so her parents
don &apos;t know that they &apos;re the reason she did it .
okay , hold on .
you can &apos;t just blame the parents .
jane , they put a lot of pressure on her to succeed .
frankie , it &apos;s never that simple .
all right . all right , i appreciate it . thank you .
jane , they found it .
the plymouth ?
it was in the quarry .
maine troopers found it under some trees .
we got to get it to maura .
it &apos;s already handled . it &apos;s on the way to her .
mr. and mrs. jalbani .
we &apos;ve completed the investigation .
and this mechanic -- have you arrested him ?
no , we didn &apos;t find any evidence
that layla &apos;s car had been tampered with .
then what happened ?
w @-@ why was she even on that terrible road ?
please .
the truth is layla was under a lot of stress .
did you know that she was failing
three classes at pemberton ?
failing ?
are you sure ?
she never said anything .
maybe she didn &apos;t want to disappoint you .
we could never be disappointed in layla .
she was so much more than we could have ever imagined .
but failing would have been devastating for her .
i mean , she pushed herself so hard .
you said that layla was gonna be the first one
in your family to graduate college .
that she had a bright future .
yes .
that must have meant a lot to you ?
yes , but , i mean , it meant everything to layla .
we knew that she was worried .
you know , we said , &quot; you come home .
you go to the community college for one year , two years . &quot;
but layla , she wouldn &apos;t hear of it .
she was determined to succeed .
that sounds like ...
layla put a lot of pressure on herself .
always .
i don &apos;t understand .
did this have anything to do with her crash ?
uh , not -- not directly .
i guess it just might explain
why she was distracted that night .
actually , our -- our investigation determined
that this was nothing more than a tragic accident .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
if there &apos;s anything else , please don &apos;t hesitate to call .
i found another one .
what -- print ?
partial .
probably not enough for an i.d. ,
but it is on top of blood spatter from the trooper .
well , so , that puts alice in the vehicle
when the trooper was shot .
well , only if we could positively
identify it as alice &apos;s .
maura .
kent .
swab the seatbelt clasp
and the glove @-@ compartment handle for dna .
got it .
there &apos;s also a possibility on the trunk @-@ release latch .
she torched the trunk .
yeah , well , dna is resistant to high temperatures .
you know , alice left the police academy 20 years ago .
we &apos;ve come a long way since then .
all right , i &apos;m gonna run these samples through the sequencer .
you &apos;re hovering .
wait , there &apos;s something here .
it &apos;s smeared , but --
maura , we got to convince a judge , okay ?
a partial ain &apos;t gonna cut it .
well , not by themselves , maybe .
but if we can put them together ...
like a puzzle .
exactly .
i just hope we have enough pieces .
was that a good beep or a bad beep ?
it &apos;s a match to alice sands .
you &apos;re sure ?
we have a dna match , too .
alice sands definitely touched that seatbelt .
the evidence places her in the car .
that &apos;ll tie her to the trooper &apos;s murder .
that &apos;s enough for any court .
we got her .
we finally got her .
you two , around back .
she &apos;s not here .
are you sure she didn &apos;t leave ?
we were covering the front and the back .
she didn &apos;t get past us .
no !
drop the gun !
don &apos;t shoot !
alice , let him go .
do it !
let him go .
do it !
alice , let him go .
jane .
please .
jane ?
knock it down .
tell them to stay out or i &apos;ll kill the kid right now .
you don &apos;t want to do that .
you want to watch him bleed out on the floor ?
no , please !
do it !
korsak , back off ! she &apos;s got a hostage .
there .
okay , see ?
it &apos;s just you and me , all right ?
it &apos;s just you and me , okay ?
look , look , look , let &apos;s just put our guns down , okay ?
oh , yeah , you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
so you could put a bullet through my head .
no . no , i wouldn &apos;t . no , i don &apos;t want to do that .
bullshit ! you are such a liar .
you want me dead .
alice , i don &apos;t want that .
you &apos;re so smug . you always were .
listen to me , okay ?
you let him go .
all right ? i will stay .
okay , come on , he &apos;s got nothing to do with this .
jane rizzoli -- always trying to be the hero .
i &apos;m just doing my job !
that &apos;s all i know how to do , okay ?
alice , please .
okay , we can still walk out of here .
it &apos;s over .
maybe , but i &apos;ll still win .
because after you kill me ,
everyone will think you &apos;re a dirty cop .
&quot; did jane rizzoli really kill
that poor woman in cold blood ? &quot;
you won &apos;t be so perfect then .
i &apos;m not gonna shoot you .
i &apos;m not gonna shoot you .
i &apos;m not gonna give you the choice .
no !
jane ?
come on , come on .
come on .
jane ?
jane , you okay ?
you &apos;re good .
it &apos;s okay .
you okay ?
yeah .
you good ?
this stool taken ?
why ? you want to throw it at me ?
i want to apologize .
no , i &apos;m the one who should be apologizing .
i completely misread things ,
probably screwed up our friendship .
frankie , stop .
i freaked out a little . that &apos;s all .
see , i hate that i put you in that position .
since marcus died , i &apos;ve been on my own .
that was my first kiss .
i should have known that .
aw , i &apos;m such an idiot .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t worry .
it will never happen again .
i didn &apos;t say that .
that happened .
well , i -- i think i should buy you a drink .
i think you better , after that . yeah .
okay .
that &apos;s all of it .
much better .
now it feels like a real home .
maybe we could move this and give you some more room .
what &apos;s in it ?
no idea .
ooh , interesting .
what ?
it &apos;s a torture device .
you want me to show you how it works ?
no ! i want you to shut that thing immediately .
what ? this is fascinating .
these are actual medieval torture devices .
well , now i understand why you
and the professor were friends .
what is that ? !
a tongue tearer .
okay , well , that seems completely necessary .
medieval birth control .
just don &apos;t go out ,
and then you don &apos;t need birth control .
or you can call martinez .
no .
you really think so ?
definitely .
okay , i &apos;ll call martinez
if you ask kent out .
wha -- kent ?
yes , kent .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s so obvious there &apos;s totally something going on .
maura !
that &apos;s ridiculous .
it is
we work together .
come on . bring the tongue tearer , though .
you &apos;re gonna need that .
yeah , he does talk a lot .
jane .
i saw the news .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re okay .
thank you .
i have time , if you needed the confessional .
actually , i don &apos;t .
i mean , not -- not today , anyway .
i just --
i just came by to pay my respects .
&quot; but i say to you , &apos; love your enemies
and pray for those that persecute you . &apos; &quot;
matthew .
i can &apos;t say it to that ,
but ... i &apos;m okay with the way it turned out .
i hope he is , too .
