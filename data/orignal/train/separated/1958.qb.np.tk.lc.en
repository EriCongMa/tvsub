i am fine . i am happy to be here .
truly , i have been through a lot ,
and i &apos;m lucky to be alive ,
and i &apos;m lucky to be okay , and i get that .
so , yes , i &apos;m just happy to be here .
great .
you know , doctor , most surgeons ,
get kind of rankled at hospital @-@ mandated therapy .
bailey &apos;s just looking out for me .
i know the drill .
so this should be quick .
you know , you chose the short straw ,
or the -- is it the long straw ?
whatever the good straw is .
lay off the damn horn , will ya ?
god , carpool sucks . hang on .
is wilson coming ?
i think so .
what do you mean you think so ?
i can &apos;t -- look , she &apos;s all over the place .
i don &apos;t even know why she let me back in the house .
we barely talk , which is probably good
because it &apos;s fewer chances i &apos;ll piss her off again .
that &apos;s pathetic .
what &apos;s her problem ?
she &apos;s in a mood .
still ?
i said to tell her that i needed a minute .
you didn &apos;t tell me that .
yes , i did . you didn &apos;t listen .
so done with carpool .
incoming . 20 minutes , chest pains .
i &apos;ll take it . page cardio -- anyone but riggs .
page riggs .
he just said -- - i can hear .
you know that dr. hunt punched dr. riggs .
the only way they &apos;re gonna learn to work together
is if they work together ,
so any cardio consults that get paged to the pit ,
you page riggs .
you know this is my one happy place right now ?
please don &apos;t make it a crappy place .
oh , kepner . i feel you . i do .
page riggs .
maya roberts
dr. karev . i know .
this is my mom , judi .
thank you for making the time to see my daughter .
have we met before ?
i looked you up . and you are ?
cross -- dr. cross .
go .
right .
&quot; maya roberts , 15 .
status -- post below @-@ knee amputation of the right leg
two years ago after diagnosis of bone cancer ,
now recurring in the ribs and sternum . &quot;
i know why i &apos;m here .
i just wanted to talk about you .
it says here in your c.v.
you made buttholes for babies who didn &apos;t have them .
hang on . that &apos;s --
listen , i &apos;m 15 with a chest full of cancer .
this hospital is known for making miracles happen ,
and i &apos;m looking for an epic @-@ size miracle .
according to my research ,
it looks like you &apos;re the guy who can make it happen .
i am confused about the buttholes .
strange detour . so , discuss .
or how about you humor me
and let me pretend - like i &apos;m in charge for a sec ?
now , ms. roberts --
what do you want to know ?
two years ago , i felt a pain in my right tibia .
she &apos;s got a real mind for this stuff .
they did labs , p.e.t. scan , the works .
turns out i &apos;m one in , like , a bajillion kids
to get chondrosarcoma .
so chemo and radiation weren &apos;t an option .
you get points .
sweet .
sorry .
hey , remember , we said no crying .
i know . sorry .
there was a one in four chance of recurrence ,
so it &apos;s not a huge shocker , but it is back ,
and it &apos;s bigger than ever in my chest .
we have our work cut out for us , gentlemen .
robbins is going out tonight .
do you want to maybe come over when you &apos;re done ?
yeah . no , crap . we have a &quot; mer &quot; thing .
again ?
yeah .
come over after ?
yes .
okay . go . fix your hair .
chest pains , huh ?
yep .
so , what &apos;s he doing here ? kepner , i told you --
i know you did , but this is what &apos;s happening .
i gave you a direct order .
come on , hunt . you &apos;ve turned everyone here against me .
the least you can do is let me frigging work .
you have no business being here at all .
guys , stop .
you know what ? i &apos;m sick and tired of hearing about it .
why don &apos;t find someplace else to work ?
oh , yay ! someone &apos;s hurt .
male , 55 , complaining of tightness in the chest .
sir , do you have any pain in your left arm ?
no , not really .
my chest hurts like hell , though .
riggs , you can go . i got this .
chest pains . i &apos;ll take it .
sir , what did you eat this morning ?
a burrito -- two burritos .
it &apos;s probably not surgical . i &apos;ll page someone if it is .
let &apos;s go .
how about you let me do my job ?
how about you get the hell away ?
how about you both shut up ?
boom . i &apos;ll be in , i &apos;ll be out .
these sessions shouldn &apos;t take all that long .
but before we start , doctor ,
i was assigned your case ,
and if you would prefer a female therapist ,
i would be totally comfortable with that .
oh , because it was a man who attacked me ?
yeah . and it &apos;s important that you feel
that you &apos;re with the right person ,
that you feel comfortable , that you get what you need .
i appreciate that . i &apos;m fine .
i just need a tape @-@ and @-@ glue guy .
tape and glue ?
yeah , just , you know , ask me a few questions
and patch me up and send me on my way .
i &apos;ve been to therapy before .
i &apos;ve dealt with the big stuff .
this isn &apos;t the big stuff that we &apos;re dealing with .
meredith ...
you were attacked in your own hospital ,
and you consider that small stuff ?
have you read my file ?
you &apos;re saying that you &apos;ve been through a lot .
i am , and i have . my mother died of alzheimer &apos;s .
my stepmother died of the hiccups .
my sister died in a plane crash .
my husband was hit by a semi .
that file , it &apos;s a real page @-@ turner .
meredith ,
something terrible happened to you .
it did .
and terrible things happen every day .
what the hell was
- coming through !
oh , my god .
shepherd , with me -- trauma 2 .
take him into trauma 3 .
tell any incoming to go somewhere else .
keep everyone out of the ambulance bay .
i need a trauma panel , lap pads , and a surgical tray .
someone notify the o.r.
right away , doctor .
hold on . you &apos;re next .
i should &apos;ve gone somewhere else .
what the hell was that ?
ambulance exploded .
what ?
partial thickness burns to the upper chest .
follow the light with your eyes .
okay , good .
what happened ?
your rig exploded , but don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ve got you , okay ? you &apos;re gonna be okay .
oh , shepherd , they need you in trauma 1 .
they figure out why that rig blew up ?
uh , fire department &apos;s looking at it now .
oh , my god . it was me .
i didn &apos;t secure the oxygen tank .
johnny &apos;s always saying ...
he &apos;s gonna kill me .
it was an accident , and he knows that .
he &apos;s gonna kill me .
don &apos;t arch your neck . all right .
there &apos;s a lot venous blood in the upper chest .
the lac extends deep into the liver .
let me get in there , establish vascular control .
no , we &apos;re gonna pack him and take him up .
and then we &apos;ll be able to see what the hell &apos;s going on .
he &apos;s open right now . just let me work .
he is hemorrhaging like crazy .
i &apos;m not gonna let him bleed out down here .
suction . more laps .
he &apos;s got a depressed skull fracture . he needs a c.t.
look , owen , you know i can do this . let me stabilize him .
riggs , this is the plan . get on board , or get out .
your plan is working great .
better still , just get out .
kepner , over here .
to hell with this !
when you first woke up after the attack ,
what is the first thing you remember ?
people .
people running around everywhere .
who specifically ?
it was pretty crazy .
thank you . you , sir , have indigestion .
deluca here will get you an antacid .
so-- sorry , sir .
and , also schedule an upper endoscopy , please .
deluca , do you have somewhere to be ?
no .
then put the damn phone away .
okay , he &apos;ll , get you the rest of your meds ,
and you just , sit tight , okay ?
deluca !
torres is on her way .
oh , okay . thanks .
hey , listen , do you think
tonight maybe you and i could just -- i don &apos;t know .
oh , actually , i &apos;m having some people over tonight .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s nothing big , just steph , blake , and warren .
okay , yeah . i mean , i get off late ,
but i can pick up something on the way home .
no , i meant ,
i &apos;d kind of just like to spend some time with my friends .
yeah , no .
i got something later anyway , so ...
oh , great , so you have someplace to be .
yeah , yeah , yeah , i got someplace to be .
finally .
can you , uh , look at these ?
so , how old is this patient ?
15 going on 35 .
standard titanium plates , right ?
unless her parents will
go for a stem @-@ cell scaffolding in the chest .
well , it &apos;s , uh , just the mom
and , look , i @-@ i don &apos;t want to leave this girl
with an unprotected heart for years .
i need to make a recommendation .
well , we could look into new technology .
no , i want the safest option .
then you go with plates .
tried and true .
so ? hit me .
well , i , consulted with our ortho and cardio chiefs ,
and , uh , the best solution is a titanium @-@ plate sternum
and ribcage .
okay . that &apos;s ...
that sounds good .
how many revision surgeries ?
probably ... once a year until you reach full growth .
and if i get hit with , say , even a nerf ball to the chest ?
we &apos;ll -- we &apos;ll just be very careful , won &apos;t we ?
just answer my question .
it &apos;s very dangerous , yes .
so we &apos;re talking multiple surgeries ?
you &apos;re just gonna open and reopen my chest ?
um , i &apos;m sorry .
can you explain what she mea--
a zipper scar .
oh , h @-@ honey , i--
we &apos;ll need to go in a few times ,
but i assure you - it &apos;s the safest , best option .
i figured out how to do it all on a leg and a half ,
and now you want to limit everything i do
for my entire childhood ?
this is how you get - the rest of your childhood .
i &apos;m trying to save your life , maya .
sweetheart , we should consider this .
maybe -- - i went to three different hospitals
before i came here ,
and they all said the same thing .
they said , &quot; go to grey @-@ sloan .
do to dr. karev . &quot;
so now i &apos;m here , and this is all i get -- just this ?
i &apos;m disappointed in you .
dr. karev , you &apos;re off my case .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you &apos;re fired .
a terrible thing happened .
i did get knocked around .
but nobody died .
and any day where nobody dies , that &apos;s a good day .
so , when you were laid up , healing ,
who visited you the most ?
alex .
remind me -- alex is ...
alex is the one who proposed to his girlfriend .
right . and she said no .
well , see , she didn &apos;t really say no ,
and she didn &apos;t say yes , and then she booted him ,
and then he came back to live with me .
alex was there when you woke up .
i delivered him on a silver platter to her .
and he still managed to screw it up .
you said he moved back in with her .
i mean to the place .
they &apos;re together , but they &apos;re not together ,
but they could be together .
it &apos;s ... they &apos;re stupid .
you have feelings for alex ? are you in love with alex ?
do i have feelings for alex ?
that &apos;s funny .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just trying to understand why we &apos;re talking about them .
because he &apos;s being stupid .
uh , can she actually fire us ? she &apos;s a kid .
oh , shut up .
she &apos;s older than you are , and she &apos;s smarter .
she &apos;ll cool off . she &apos;ll come around .
go check my post @-@ ops .
well , i &apos;ve never been fired before .
does this go on my permanent record ? !
god .
you -- you have to stop paging me , okay ?
i &apos;m getting in trouble now .
i was trying to find out if you were --
&quot; you okay ? are you okay ? are you okay ? &quot;
yes , i &apos;m okay . why wouldn &apos;t i be okay ?
i thought you got blown up by an ambulance .
what ? i wasn &apos;t even ...
you were worried about me .
crap .
a consult .
mm , okay .
now you &apos;re getting me in trouble .
i mean , who cares if deluca is an intern ?
it &apos;s all sexy and secret at first ,
and then it &apos;s just a pain in the ass .
so they should just bring it out in the open .
that &apos;s what derek and i did ,
and we have three beautiful children .
uh , is maggie the one in aa ?
or is she the hoverer ?
the hoverer . that &apos;s the other thing .
if she was getting it regular ,
maybe she would stop hovering all the time .
sorry .
um ... how are you ?
are you -- are you good ?
did you hear about the ambulance ?
oh , yeah , i know .
that &apos;s so crazy , right ?
well , i mean , fire , o2 tanks , poor maintenance , cigarettes .
i &apos;m sorry .
uh , uh , reasons .
ambulances explode .
it happens all the time , actually , which is weird ,
considering that their job is to not kill people but ...
it happens just like
yeah , so , um ...
are you good ?
i &apos;m okay .
uh , i should ...
i didn &apos;t screw them up . i was nice .
penny killed my husband .
i took her in , i &apos;m teaching her .
i am trying to make something good out of it .
that was very cool of me . i didn &apos;t have to do that .
no , you didn &apos;t , but why did you ?
and now callie thinks i &apos;m coming between them ,
and blake thinks so , too . i can feel it .
and it &apos;s just not true .
i did not come between their great love -- wasn &apos;t me .
i &apos;m sorry . who &apos;s callie again ?
callie is my friend in ortho .
come on . keep up .
icp is normalizing .
this drain is doing the trick .
we &apos;ll observe him tonight ,
and i &apos;ll take him up to the o.r. tomorrow
and repair the liver lac .
kepner , you free ?
uh , yeah . just let me know .
great . i &apos;ll go scrub in
and remove the drain at the same time .
so , you still living with richard ?
i &apos;m crashing here . it &apos;s a better commute .
amelia ...
you know you can stay with me .
it &apos;s not a good idea for my sobriety .
right .
i &apos;m gonna need dinner , though .
great .
dinner tonight ?
okay .
so , hunt and i will do the liver lac tomorrow .
how is the , uh , partner ?
stable . worried about his friend .
you should have cardio there , too ,
so bring in riggs just to be safe .
come on .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you know there was an explosion in the e.r. this morning .
i just really don &apos;t want to see another one
over an open patient .
you make a good point .
wait -- so it all comes out in one piece ? - exactly .
that &apos;s so freaking cool .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , um , dr. karev , uh , these two are gonna make me those .
pierce and i had an idea .
&apos;cause they &apos;re geniuses .
well , she kind of is , too .
it does sound pretty amazing .
you just took over my case ?
she paged us for a consult .
yeah , no offense , but you &apos;re not my doctor anymore .
but i think when you see this , you &apos;re gonna want in .
can you show him this ?
yeah , hit it .
okay , so , i can excise maya &apos;s tumors ,
but instead of the traditional titanium reconstruction ,
i can 3 @-@ d print a new sternum and ribs .
they &apos;ll be molded to her exact body specifications
so she can move around more naturally .
have you ever done this ?
it &apos;s only been done once before on an adult ,
but i can modify it for a child .
yeah , i &apos;ll be the first .
i &apos;ll look like the terminator , which is badass .
can i see you two outside ?
you said yourself titanium plates are the best option .
that was before i knew
that callie could print her her own ribcage .
it will be fewer surgeries in the long run .
you &apos;re not experimenting on some kid .
she may think she knows what she wants ,
but she &apos;s not old enough to understand the risks .
she gets it . trust me .
i know a little something about being labeled
too smart for your age .
i love her .
i &apos;m not signing off on this .
you &apos;re not on the case anymore ,
and her mom has the consent forms .
oh , you know as well as i do she &apos;s freaking useless .
i mean , you can &apos;t even -- - karev , karev .
ms. roberts , please .
this is a @-@ a dangerous experimental procedure
with zero proof that it &apos;ll work ,
let alone keep your kid alive .
trust me when i tell you you don &apos;t want to do this .
please , mom .
it &apos;s what she wants .
you swiped her .
we didn &apos;t swipe her .
she fired you and asked us .
no one &apos;s looking out for this kid --
not her mom , not -- not anyone .
um , we are , alex .
and i wouldn &apos;t have even suggested it
if i didn &apos;t believe that it was the best thing for her .
no arguing .
fun . remember ? fun ?
for meredith , for support .
i postponed sex for this .
maggie &apos;s a hoverer .
god , she hovers all the time .
does it bother you , the hovering ?
no , she &apos;s just being sisterly or whatever .
why would you say that ?
so , how long is this going to last ?
come on . it &apos;s fun .
i want to go to bed .
oh , i do , too , and i can &apos;t go home .
i don &apos;t want to go home -- alone .
i miss penny .
i miss having sex .
penny and i had the greatest sex .
it was that &quot; journey of discovery &quot; great sex
you have in the beginning .
jo and i had sex like that all the time .
and now no penny , no sex .
no sex with penny . none of it .
okay , let &apos;s not talk about sex , because the chief is here .
i &apos;m just eating my pizza .
besides , it sounds like none of y &apos;all are getting any anyway .
pierce is getting some .
no , i &apos;m not . don &apos;t say that . forget he said that .
so annoying .
she has people over all the time ,
like if i &apos;m alone , i &apos;ll explode or something .
they won &apos;t go away .
okay , but , guys , really , you can go .
no , we &apos;re here because it &apos;s fun .
no , really , it &apos;s okay .
are you sure ?
i can -- - &apos; cause you seem a little --
cranky as hell ?
which is totally understandable
with everything you &apos;ve gone through .
of course you would be .
and we &apos;re worried .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
we know .
and i &apos;m not cranky .
i know .
except you are all the time .
do you want to be alone ?
well , i &apos;m a widow .
i &apos;m good at it .
i really just want -- - what ?
well , then , tell them to go away .
well , no , because they &apos;re just trying to help .
what do you want ?
what can we do ?
but they &apos;re not being helpful .
and it &apos;s all right for you to tell them that .
leave my house .
get out .
i mean , thank you , but , really , just go be with whoever
somewhere else so that i can go to sleep .
leave .
you seem angry .
i &apos;m not .
my bad .
i took your advice .
i kicked them all out of my house last night .
and ...
it worked . they left me alone .
well , that &apos;s what you wanted .
i know .
hey . dr. webber .
arizona &apos;s just gonna be a second , so --
oh , thanks .
hey , let &apos;s get a move on !
trivia &apos;s starting in 15 minutes !
coming !
hey . looking sharp .
got a hot date ?
uh , yeah , something like that .
she &apos;s , uh -- - we &apos;re kind of keeping it quiet .
oh . secret romance ?
i &apos;m guessing she works at the hospital ?
i mean , she --
relax , son . okay .
i get it .
you know , it &apos;s been a few years ,
but if yours is anything like mine was ,
keeping it a secret makes it just that much more exciting .
you know , you &apos;re totally right .
i mean , she -- she keeps it so together
in front of people at work , but then , when we &apos;re alone ,
she &apos;s so -- - she &apos;s a wildcat , huh ?
how ... do i look ?
do i look hot ?
you &apos;re very hot .
can we go now ?
thank you . whew !
okay . see you later .
you have fun , too .
have fun tonight , deluca .
thanks .
oh , and , uh ... you can &apos;t tame a wildcat .
it &apos;s infuriating because i know that our problems
haven &apos;t just magically disappeared .
thanks .
hey , uh , when are the rest of the guys coming ?
this is it .
all right .
why did you let him move in ?
because he showed up on my door all sad
with his big , sweet face
and made me forget everything that was wrong with us .
i know .
i see callie walking down the hall ,
she and i are barely talking , and i still get stupid .
i want to get stupid over somebody .
all i ever feel is smart .
i just want to take his dumb , gorgeous face ,
and i just -- i want to -- i want to pummel it ...
and kiss it and marry it
and just pummel it .
i get that , too .
not the pummeling , but the kissing .
i thought you didn &apos;t even want to marry him ?
i don &apos;t know what i want . i can &apos;t be trusted .
i want to know what guys want .
hey , warren , warren .
you &apos;re a guy . what do you want ?
um ... you know , that &apos;s , uh -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s tough . um ...
did anybody see that an ambulance blew up in the e.r. today ?
no , we &apos;re serious . what do guys want ?
what do guys want ?
out of this conversation .
i just got an important text , and i have to go .
you are impossible .
oh , women are just as impossible .
really ?
look , i , uh -- i can &apos;t speak for all men .
i &apos;m just a guy who wants to go home to his wife .
sorry . good night .
screw bailey .
she got the good one .
she did .
looks like you owe me another beer .
oh , hell .
hey , no one forced you to take bets you couldn &apos;t win .
what is the deal , nathan ?
no deal .
go again ?
i talked about owen dozens of times
when we were over there ,
and you never even mentioned knowing him .
well , i didn &apos;t want to talk about it .
so , what , you guys have just , like , always hated each other ?
no , i never hated him .
we became doctors together ,
went through school , field training .
there was no one i trusted more . we were like brothers .
what happened ?
you &apos;re up .
okay , so we &apos;re not talking about this ?
we &apos;re playing darts .
how &apos;d you get so good at darts anyway ?
you pick up some things
when you have no reason to go home .
so , what are you gonna do ?
you gonna sign the papers ?
we &apos;re playing darts .
fine with me .
hey , you ready ? i &apos;m starving .
listen , can we do this another night ?
uh , okay .
i &apos;m not hungry , and i @-@ i don &apos;t want to --
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing , nothing .
just be better another night , okay ?
is this about riggs ?
can you ...
i &apos;m not getting into it .
everything doesn &apos;t need to be talked about .
okay .
yeah , i understand .
so another time you will call me , and we &apos;ll go out .
but you won &apos;t , will you ?
or you will and i will cave and go
and i will talk too much and you will say nothing .
and i @-@ i &apos;m -- i don &apos;t know how to do this thing that you do
where you make me feel like crap
and there are no words coming out of your mouth .
so ... whatever .
you &apos;ll call me maybe -- or maybe not .
and maybe i will not care .
i had a sister .
megan .
she was three years younger than me .
smarter than me , funnier than me --
better person than me , okay ?
but she did everything i did .
we went to med school together , and that &apos;s where we met riggs .
nate was my best friend .
and megan loved him .
and he was with her the day that we lost her .
i trusted him with her ,
and he was like a brother to me .
and he should &apos;ve ...
but he didn &apos;t .
and i don &apos;t talk about it .
okay .
can i say one thing ?
she loved him .
there &apos;s a reason . she loved him for a reason .
that &apos;s what i hold on to . derek loved her .
your sister loved riggs .
so there &apos;s good in there .
that makes him family .
and that means that maybe he deserves another chance .
are you still hungry ?
what are we eating ?
i could go for a pizza .
me , too .
what are you doing here ?
hanging .
i kicked you off my case .
i know . i &apos;m not gonna operate on you .
then what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m holding your hand .
figured you &apos;d want someone to hold your hand .
i mean , if you have nothing better to do .
okay , maya . we &apos;re ready to roll .
dr. karev .
all right , everybody , clear the room . give her a minute .
okay .
you want me to get your mom ?
no , no .
she &apos;ll just freak out .
she was practically my age when she had me .
and she works two jobs to cover my bills
and the good insurance .
she tries .
if something happens to me , will you tell her
that there &apos;s an envelope under my bed with bank statements
and the deed to our house ?
just don &apos;t forget , okay ?
hey , none of that .
oh , god , i don &apos;t want to die .
you &apos;re not gonna die .
we both know - you can &apos;t promise anything .
you good ?
yeah .
let &apos;s do this .
um , do me a favor , though .
if you &apos;re not too busy making some kid a butthole ,
can you keep my mom company ?
okay .
thank you .
you said - you were good at being alone .
will you stop saying what i said ?
okay .
so , why are you so angry ?
i &apos;m not .
okay .
so , how was it ?
it was fine .
i checked on the kids ,
i read a book , i went to sleep .
it was good advice .
i got what i needed .
i-- it was ...
what ?
they left me alone .
you said the first thing you remember after the attack was --
pain .
everything hurt .
no , actually , you said it was people .
everyone was there , you said .
yeah . every time i opened my eyes ,
it was like the freaking &quot; wizard of oz . &quot;
everyone was there .
maggie was there . richard was there .
they were there to help .
i mean , they were doing their jobs .
just being good doctors ?
yeah . doing their jobs .
looking good . drain is out .

meredith , how did it feel for you ?
you know , stuck there , can &apos;t move , can &apos;t hear ,
can &apos;t speak , just watching everyone ?
crappy .
you use that word a lot .
can you try a different one ?
i don &apos;t know . open . exposed . alone .
yeah , but you weren &apos;t alone .
they were all there .
they all had you .
so , i ask once again ...
... how did it feel for you ?
yeah .
crappy really is the best word .
thank you .
okay .
oh , shoot .
ugh . shoot . damn it !
what ? what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s not fitting .
how is that possible ? it &apos;s custom @-@ made for her .
no , it &apos;s -- the ribs are fine .
it &apos;s like a fitted sheet on a bed .
once you attach one side -- - the other side pops out .
yeah , and another set &apos;s gonna take 14 hours to print .
can we leave her open for that long ?
n @-@ no . no .
it will leave her at risk for post @-@ opt infection , clots .
so , now what ?
they want to retract her rib cage ,
pull it open to make enough space for the new ribs to fit .
no .
i mean , they could
slip and puncture her lung and her heart .
we know . or crack her ribs .
and if she &apos;s under too long ,
they &apos;ll never get her off the vent .
alex , either this or we go back to the plates .
which is exactly what she doesn &apos;t want .
that &apos;s why they wanted to check before they went ahead .
i don &apos;t want to wake her up and ask her .
she signed a consent .
we don &apos;t need her permission .
they wanted to check with you .
my mom was just like her .
i had to take care of everything .
makes a girl glad she was left in a stroller at a fire station .
made you tough .
maya &apos;s tough .
she can do it .
okay . on my count . one , two , three .
careful not to compress her heart .
i &apos;m trying .
wilson , i know that you can pull harder than that .
okay .
again . one , two , three .
okay . come on .
oh , crap . she &apos;s been under too long .
she &apos;s fluid overloaded .
her heart &apos;s beginning to fail .
and done here .
good ? kepner , would you finish up closing ?
uh , yeah . yeah , of course .
uh ... that was ...
insane . have you ever seen anything like that ?
it &apos;s like they formed one super surgeon .
that was a thing of beauty .
it was like watching ballet .
uh , kepner , i think you owe me an apology .
just because we saved a patient
doesn &apos;t mean things are back ...
do i , though ?
you didn &apos;t screw this up because i was there .
if i wasn &apos;t there , that &apos;s when --
whoa , whoa , whoa . stop .
yeah , okay .
all i know is when they &apos;re all at my house , i want them gone .
and then , when they leave , i don &apos;t feel any better .
so , what , does that make me crazy ?
i was gonna say it makes you human .
i am very good at being alone .
i &apos;ve taught myself how to do it .
and i don &apos;t mean my kids . i love my kids .
and i have my class and my work .
i have moved on .
you see , but , uh , - a widow really hasn &apos;t moved on .
she &apos;s still sort of married .
she &apos;s just married to a dead guy .
you &apos;re not married anymore .
and you &apos;re not a widow anymore .
so , what are you ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , so , what happens now ?
i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s up to you .

signing the papers for dr. bailey .
you show no signs of ptsd .
and you &apos;re certainly capable
of taking care of your patients ...
and yourself .
but i feel terrible .
i came in here , and i felt great .
and now i don &apos;t know who i am or what i want .

and they were all there .
and they still are .
