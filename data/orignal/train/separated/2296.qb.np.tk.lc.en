第十六集
our secret remains safe .
the author &apos;s pen ?
i &apos;m gonna write the stories as they are ,
and i &apos;ll start with hades .
she &apos;s pregnant .
you two had a contract ,
which he just signed over to me .
at any time , i can cash in and take ... your ... baby .
you work for me .
poor babe .
now i must give you away to give me ...
my best chance .
you gave away the wrong child , mother .
soon , you &apos;ll see .
soon .
no , no , no , no , no !
well , isn &apos;t this nice ?
w @-@ w @-@ what do you want ? !
why , you , of course .
you &apos;re going to help me create a very special spell ,
one that no sorcerer has yet to achieve --
a time @-@ travel spell .
i just need the ingredients --
symbols of innocence and love and courage and wisdom .
a symbol of innocence could be a baby , for instance ,
and a symbol of wisdom ...
could be a brain .
your brain , to be exact .
oh , no ! no , no , no , no , no !
stop !
dorothy ?
didn &apos;t i send you back to kansas ?
well , witch ...
... i &apos;m back .
those slippers .
they were supposed to be a one @-@ way ticket home !
you left me no choice . i had to return .
when i got word that you were alive ,
and had taken over oz , i had to stop you .
you got word ?
munchkins .
i hate those mouthy , little vermin !
let the scarecrow go .
yes .
sorry .
think i &apos;ll hold on to him .
you will never defeat me , zelena ,
because i have the most powerful weapon of all --
the love of the people .
well , then ...
no !
you &apos;d think a desperate man would work a little faster .
magic cannot be rushed .
creating a portal is no simple task .
yes .
yes , i know .
but we don &apos;t have a dark curse
or a magic bean or silver slippers .
we have something better -- your dark one @-@ tainted blood .
it got you down here . it can reopen the portal .
why do you even need a portal ?
you can come and go as you please .
but i can &apos;t bring anyone back -- alive .
by combining our powers ...
that can change .
and i don &apos;t care how painful it is for you .
so , if you want me to tear up this contract
so your child @-@ to @-@ be is your child @-@ to @-@ be ...
... you won &apos;t care about the pain , either .
you must tell me where you want this portal directed .
why , storybrooke , of course .
why , hello , little ones .
did you sleep well ?
yeah ?
belle .
what are you doing here ?
uh , formula for the babies ?
of course . here . i &apos;ll help .
uh , the red one &apos;s hers .
right .
i don &apos;t know where my head is today .
uh , mother superior , what -- what &apos;s going on ?
nothing . everything &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not .
what --
who are you ?
zelena .
you really are a clever girl .
no , no , no .
regina sent you back to oz . ho @-@ how did you --
all you need to know is that my sister can &apos;t keep me down .
i &apos;ve come for my baby .
so , if you wish to remain alive , step aside .
zelena &apos;s baby ?
what do you want with her child ?
well , you of all people should know the value
of keeping your reasons your own .
i don &apos;t have to tell you anything .
and yet you keep doing so .
some might call that the mark of an insecure man .
we &apos;re done here .
get me zelena &apos;s baby .
i &apos;ll rip up the contract ,
and you can tell belle she &apos;s pregnant
without also having to tell her
she owes her baby to me .
i hear new expectant mothers hate that .
almost as much as they hate hearing
their husbands are still the dark one .
now do it .
put her -- put her down .
or what ?
you &apos;ll smite me with your book learnin &apos; ?
oh , i have something more than that .
please .
neither of you would dare risk hurting my child .
no , you -- you don &apos;t want to hurt your baby .
no .
but i don &apos;t mind hurting you .
okay . we &apos;ll see .
stop it !
stop it ! you &apos;re endangering everyone !
it &apos;s not me that &apos;s doing it !
no !
okay .
where &apos;s the baby ?
w @-@ what happened ?
how did we get out here ?
my baby . my baby ! is she hurt ? !
oh , my magic !
zelena , what did you do to us ?
i didn &apos;t do anything ! this wasn &apos;t me !
okay , then , if it wasn &apos;t you , then who was it ,
and -- and where are we ?
and why is the sky red ?
no , no , no !
what ?
we &apos;re in the underworld .
okay .
then , uh , t @-@ then rumple must need my help .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
wait .
hades .
we &apos;re here because of me .
and now i know why -- my baby .
what ?
hades wants your baby ?
hand her over . please .
no .
no , nothing good ever came of anyone trusting you .
give her to me !
belle , please ! give her to me ! i can keep her safe !
please !
belle ? !
belle ? !
so , i heard someone of the munchkin persuasion
tipped off dorothy that i was still alive .
since you &apos;re all so fond of tattling ,
i &apos;ll give you the chance to make it up to me .
where can i find the scarecrow ? !
we don &apos;t know ! we swear !
fine .
have it your way , boq !
did that loosen your bearded lips ?
or would you like to turn into a pile of ash , too ? !
now , now . no need to make more of a mess .
who the hell are you ? !
who the hell am i ?
that question is more appropriate than you know .
please -- allow me to introduce myself .
i am hades .
really ?
king of the underworld ?
yes .
my reputation precedes me .
and to what do i owe this visit ?
your handiwork has impressed me .
you &apos;ve sent so many my way .
that last headless guard --
you have panache .
true .
but i sense there &apos;s something else .
i heard a rumor that you &apos;re dabbling in time travel ,
trying to achieve the unachievable .
it won &apos;t be unachievable for long .
which is why i &apos;m here .
i believe in you .
is the devil flirting with me ?
yes .
uh , i &apos;m not the devil .
people are always conflating us .
no , i want to help you .
this scarecrow -- he is one of the ingredients you need ?
yes .
and i had him until a meddling farm girl got in the way .
dorothy .
you know her ?
well , i did my research before i came ,
and from what i hear , she &apos;s a powerful woman .
so am i.
yes , yes , i know . i know .
but she has one thing you don &apos;t --
the love of the people .
and pardon me for saying so , but no one loves you .
but there is a way to defeat her .
with an ally .
and what does hades need with a time @-@ travel spell ?
all in good time , zelena .
all in good time .
i don &apos;t need anyone &apos;s help .
we haven &apos;t ordered yet .
one dry wheat toast , one oatmeal .
i know the orders of all the regulars .
i &apos;ll get your cocoa .
what ?
david , we &apos;re regulars .
we were only supposed to be here for a day ,
and now we &apos;re regulars at the diner in hell .
um , on the way to hell .
you know what i mean .
you &apos;re thinking about neal .
i do , too -- all the time .
if only we could talk to him .
if he could just ... hear our voices ...
you can do that .
it &apos;s a simple level 1 haunting .
lots of people do it here until they lose interest
in life and people and ...
joy .
i know where a booth is .
a booth ? for haunting ?
where ?
oh , here and there .
what do you want ?
breathe into this .
the breath of the living buys a lot on the black market here .
okay .
um , the booth is by the bus stop .
just pick up the phone
and tell the operator who you wish to haunt .
happy haunting !
let &apos;s go , snow .
let &apos;s talk to our boy .
riveting tale .
snow likes oatmeal .
is my morning breakfast in there , too ?
henry , i thought you were gonna use your author powers
to get us to defeat hades .
i don &apos;t even remember writing this .
i just woke up and had it done .
okay .
it &apos;s ... really well @-@ written .
yes , and the illustrations are lovely .
maybe if you focus harder ...
so you &apos;re all authors now ?
everyone &apos;s a writer .
everyone &apos;s got an idea .
i &apos;m doing my best .
maybe if you just laid off for a little bit ...
henry , where are you going ?
upstairs .
well , we officially have a teenager on our hands .
and a visitor in our underworld apartment .
zelena ? !
so ...
someone finally did you in .
sorry to disappoint , but i &apos;m very much alive .
then how did you get here ?
through a portal .
and i didn &apos;t come alone .
who else is here ?
our baby .
and she &apos;s in danger .
you again ?
is it your birthday ?
i didn &apos;t know the king of the underworld was so nosy .
i don &apos;t know the day i was born ,
but thank you for reminding me .
that &apos;s actually a sad story .
i only know the day that my mother abandoned me .
getting sadder .
so , this is , what , celebrating abandonment day ?
i &apos;m not celebrating anything !
please go !
you know , when i offered to help you ,
yes , it was coming from a place of self @-@ interest ,
but i really do think i can help .
you &apos;re thinking about your sister .
aren &apos;t you ?
how did you know that ?
i know exactly how you feel .
she got everything you ever wanted .
and you got nothing .
am i warm ?
yeah , you know how some people say
they look up to their older siblings like gods ?
well , my older brother is a god --
zeus .
ever hear of him ?
he got everything he ever wanted .
he rules mount olympus ,
while i &apos;m trapped ruling the underworld .
he stopped my heart .
love , happiness , joy --
they &apos;ve all been taken from me .
what i &apos;m left with is only anger and a thirst ... for vengeance .
i &apos;ve survived on that for quite some time .
only the kiss of ... true love
can restart my heart and allow me to return
a fully formed man , free of this curse .
but ... well ...
true love , hmm ?
no one is more hated than the lord of the underworld .
i could give you a run for your money .
yeah .
which is why ...
we ... must find your ingredients .
i know where this scarecrow is .
let me help you .
let me help us .
if i can travel back ...
i can see to it that it is me who winds up on olympus
and my brother ... who suffers .
well .
you might just be as vindictive as i am .
where are you going ?
to find our daughter .
what about a tracking spell ?
we don &apos;t have anything of the child &apos;s .
i don &apos;t need magic . i can find her .
i lived for years in the forest . i can track anyone .
i will find our daughter .
god .
what is this place ?
rumple .
belle .
what are you doing here ?
y @-@ y @-@ you &apos;re not -- y @-@ you didn &apos;t --
oh , no , no , no , no . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m alive .
a portal brought me and -- and the baby
and ... zelena .
that &apos;s why the spell didn &apos;t work as i thought .
brought over three bodies instead of one .
well ... you-- you did this .
who were you trying to bring if not me
and you didn &apos;t know zelena was back and --
no !
why would you steal a baby ?
no , no , no . it was -- it was hades .
he used leverage to force me .
look ...
a long time ago , long before we even met ...
i made a deal --
one i never thought would rear its head .
what did you do ?
my boy was sick .
in exchange for baelfire &apos;s life ...
i made a deal to give up my second @-@ born child .
but you don &apos;t have a second @-@ born child .
it happened , belle .
n--
i &apos;m-- i @-@ i &apos;m pregnant ?
w @-@ we &apos;re gonna have a baby ?
a @-@ a baby --
a @-@ a baby that you &apos;ve already sold !
yes , but -- but w @-@ we can fix that .
i &apos;ll use all my power . w @-@ we can fix this .
p @-@ power ?
what --
you &apos;re the dark one again .
no .
yes .
see , the thing is ...
... i love this dagger .
and i also love you .
both are possible .
look , y @-@ you wanted me to be ...
a better man .
a @-@ a @-@ and you &apos;ve done that .
but if you want me to be a different man ...
i &apos;m sorry .
this is who i am .
you weren &apos;t always .
yes , i was .
even when i was a coward , i craved power .
the only difference is , now i have it .
and i won &apos;t let it go .
not again .
right .
not even for me ?
belle , there &apos;s something you must realize .
falling in love with the man behind the beast ...
isn &apos;t really what happened to you .
you fell in love with me ...
because there was a man and a beast .
neither exists without the other .
no .
no .
i @-@ i can &apos;t condone you being like this .
not again .
yes , you can .
you just have to choose to .
and if you do ...
we can have what &apos;s important --
family , happiness .
it &apos;s your choice .
no , i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m not making any choices -- not now .
not until you get me back to our friends ...
and you &apos;ve fixed ... all of this .
then that &apos;s what i shall do .
but you &apos;ll see i &apos;m right .
you &apos;ll see .
i mean , how does this even work ?
i don &apos;t know how much time it give us .
do we just talk , or --
oh ! maybe we should sing a little song .
he likes our singing .
i don &apos;t think it really matters .
i think it &apos;s just about neal hearing our voices .
yeah , but how does that work , anyway ?
does it go directly into his ears ?
does it repeat on a loop ?
uh , excuse me .
do you know how this works -- i mean , on the other side ?
no idea .
i don &apos;t even know if the messages get through .
i hope so .
or i &apos;ve wasted a lot of time these past 30 years .
all right , come on .
okay .
before we find my daughter ,
would you do me the courtesy of sharing with me
whatever horrid name you &apos;ve saddled her with ?
probably something dreadful like brittany or nancy or --
oh , god , not marian !
zelena ...
i haven &apos;t named our child
because i need to know her first to find out who she really is ,
which i haven &apos;t been able to do
because i &apos;ve been too busy protecting her from you !
you weren &apos;t protecting her at all !
you just left her so you could go on some heroic quest .
i mean , how is finding some pirate
more important than our child ?
helping friends , setting an example of heroism --
that is important !
you know , zelena , i used to be just like you .
oh , please . don &apos;t flatter yourself .
when i was the evil queen ,
i spent every day not giving a damn about anyone .
and in return , no one ...
cared about me .
i thought all i needed was my vengeance
to keep me warm at night .
but then something happened .
my enemies ...
became my family .
and that &apos;s when i finally felt happy .
that is why i &apos;m here .
they need my help ,
and when family needs help , you step up .
in case you &apos;ve forgotten , there is someone i love
who needs my help -- my daughter !
so , if we could get on with finding her ,
that would be just brilliant !
what are we doing here ?
this is where dorothy first landed in oz .
sometimes to find someone
... you need the right ... tools .
what the hell is that ?
oh , right . they don &apos;t have these in oz .
it &apos;s called ... a bicycle .
and how is that contraption
going to help us find the scarecrow ?
oh , well ... here , hop on .
i &apos;ll show you .
oh , please .
trust me .
what is it ?
nothing .
are you ready ?
all right .
hold on .
it &apos;s like a broom with wheels !
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ve got you .
would you like to go again ?
yes , i &apos;d like to go again !
now ...
tell me how this piece of tin
is gonna help me find my prey .
that loathsome farm girl must have him carefully hidden .
simple -- this bicycle belongs to dorothy .
just enchant it , and it will take us right to her .
and the scarecrow .
belle ?
it &apos;s okay .
belle , is that you ? !
you have her ? !
yeah , here . yeah , she &apos;s fine .
are you okay ?
she &apos;s fine .
are you okay ?
daddy &apos;s got you . daddy &apos;s got you .
thank you .
yes .
thank you .
wait . what are you doing here ?
helping them .
she stole your baby .
my baby , which was stolen from me .
and now i &apos;m helping .
it &apos;s all right , belle . she won &apos;t hurt anyone .
but ...
i &apos;ve got a bottle . give her to me .
no .
give it to me . i &apos;ll do it .
i don &apos;t have any magic here , robin .
the worst thing that can happen is some mother @-@ daughter bonding .
it &apos;s all right . there &apos;s nothing nefarious in feeding .
okay , fine .
as soon as she &apos;s done ...
you &apos;re handing her back .
there , there , my little sweet pea .
there , there .
are you hungry ?
yes , you are .
your mummy knows exactly what you need , doesn &apos;t she ?
yes , she does .
okay .
that &apos;s it . she &apos;s done .
hand her back .
now , zelena .
no , sis .
not now .
not ever !
you ... can do that ?
you can talk to the real world ?
yes . or ... well , no .
i don &apos;t know .
well , at least we tried .
i just need him to hear our voices .
he will .
as soon as we make it back home .
emma , when will that be ?
we went through this with you .
for all those years , if you had just heard our voices ...
would that have made a difference ,
knowing someone out there loved you ?
oh , this won &apos;t do !
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m gonna find us a safe place , yeah ?
what is it , sweet pea ?
oh , no .
oh , no , it &apos;s okay . let mummy fix it .
my magic did this .
i did this .
i &apos;m sorry .
there she is .
go on .
this dorothy &apos;s no match for you .
i &apos;ve seen many powerful women in my day ,
but none as brilliantly wicked as you .
or clever or witty .
or beautiful .
go on . you &apos;ve got this .
all right .
if that kansas brat gets in my way ,
we &apos;ll see what gingham
looks like with blood spatter .
give him back !
oh , no !
back off , witch ! you &apos;re not taking him from me !
yes !
yes , i will .
what did you do ? !
no , no , no !
i won &apos;t let you win !
it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;m not afraid of you .
do your worst ,
but i will never be afraid of you .
not sure where all this back @-@ talk is coming from .
what happened to you in kansas ?
actually , i don &apos;t really care ,
because we &apos;re finished .
you see , i don &apos;t need to kill you ,
and , believe it or not , i don &apos;t want to .
because i want every munchkin , every quadling ,
every good witch and bad of oz to know that
the great dorothy gale can &apos;t protect them .
they need to know that you failed , and then ...
then , my pretty ...
you &apos;ll have nothing .
hades ?
hades , you were right ! she ...
hades ?
zelena ? !
are you in there ? !
zelena , enough !
it is not safe for you or our child out here !
zelena !
zelena !
i &apos;m right here .
it &apos;s all my fault .
i can &apos;t protect her .
not down here .
not from him .
you need to tell us exactly what happened with you and hades .
he wants to use her ...
for a spell .
for my time @-@ travel spell .
he &apos;s got the same thirst for vengeance as i do .
you know , he had love in his heart .
but because of me , it &apos;s gone .
and she &apos;s the ingredient .
symbol of innocence .
take her .
what ?
take her .
you can protect her , and i can &apos;t .
my magic &apos;s unpredictable .
i don &apos;t care if you never let me see her again !
you have to save her . regina , please !
it &apos;s more important than what happens to me .
we &apos;ll do everything we can to protect her .
goodbye , little one .
mummy has to let you go .
she has your eyes .
so , does she have a name yet ?
no . not yet .
i can &apos;t .
hades can do things with names .
like put them on tombstones to keep people from leaving here .
i don &apos;t even think it &apos;s wise to keep her in this apartment .
i mean , what if zelena changes her mind ?
i hate to be the one to offer optimism ,
but it sounds like she was sincere .
she was , but that doesn &apos;t mean what she knows
can &apos;t come back to bite us .
robin &apos;s taking her to the forest .
honestly , it &apos;s the only place i &apos;ve ever felt really at home .
it happened !
it happened again !
take a look .
snow , look at this .
it &apos;s neal .
why did you write this ?
it &apos;s like before .
i didn &apos;t , or i just don &apos;t remember .
it just ... wrote itself .
like it does .
&quot; the infant son of snow white and prince charming
looked up at the tiny glass unicorns
as they stirred by the wind .
but on this night , he didn &apos;t hear the chime of the crystal .
instead , he heard the voices of his mother , snow white ,
and his father , prince charming .
they sang a lullaby until he fell asleep
as soundly as if he were in their arms . &quot;
he heard us .
he heard us .
thanks , henry .
i don &apos;t know about anyone else ,
but i am really ready to get back home to my family --
my whole family .
no more waiting .
we can save ourselves .
we &apos;re going to take down hades , and we &apos;re going to do it now .
there you are .
what &apos;s this ?
dinner .
to celebrate .
you saw ?
of course i saw .
you were wonderful .
i knew you &apos;d succeed .
come . sit .
so ...
is this also a farewell dinner ...
... before you return ?
no .
i &apos;m not going back to the underworld , zelena .
but you said you needed ...
yes .
so , you think that you and me are ...
true love .
you can &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t feel something , too .
yes , but we just met .
i know , i know .
but when we were on that bicycle ...
... and i had my arms around you ...
i felt something i haven &apos;t felt in eons .
my ...
my heart ...
fluttered .
just for a moment .
and i truly believe ...
once we kiss ...
my heart will start again .
i &apos;ll be free .
and we can be together .
no !
no ? what ?
how could i be so stupid ? !
what -- what are you talking about ?
i almost believed you .
it &apos;s the truth . i promise !
you want me to kiss you to free you from the underworld !
and then you &apos;ll have the power to steal this brain
and enact my time @-@ travel spell -- for you !
and only you !
because that &apos;s what i would do .
no .
you want revenge and until you get it ,
you will never be satisfied .
you need this spell .
you need to go back to beat your brother ,
just like i need to go back to beat my sister !
love is not enough !
no , zelena . i don &apos;t want that anymore .
i want you .
i love you .
no one could love me .
but if you did ...
you wouldn &apos;t want to take away my best chance at revenge .
go back to your brimstone .
i never want to see your face again .
you will regret this ...
zelena .
hello , hades .
zelena .
you know , i was looking for you .
you were looking for my baby .
i was just a happy accident .
yes . yes , you were .
but when i heard you fell through my little portal ...
i really was looking for you .
i know .
i thought i &apos;d make it easy .
i know that you want my child for your time @-@ travel spell .
if you touch her , i will demolish you !
there &apos;s no need for that .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt you .
i never would &apos;ve hurt you .
that &apos;s the thing about true love .
i @-@ it endures . it can &apos;t be broken .
what ?
so , sending rumplestiltskin after my daughter
had nothing to do with revenge on your brother ?
zelena .
i was trying to rescue her from those miserable heroes for you .
i didn &apos;t know you were there .
despite everything i &apos;ve done , you &apos;ve loved me all this time ?
look around you .
i mean , aren &apos;t you curious why this -- this place ...
looks like storybrooke ?
i did it for you !
i saw how much you wanted to cast the dark curse
to get everything your sister had .
you made me my very own storybrooke ?
i gave you what you wanted , what she had .
it &apos;s not ... perfect .
the underworld is a place of ... well , destruction .
despite my best intentions , things don &apos;t grow here .
they ... decay .
but it &apos;s our decay .
zelena ...
wouldn &apos;t it be nice ...
to not be alone ... anymore ?
after all these years , i still choose you .
what better revenge is there than having it all ?
but i had it all .
and then i gave them back my baby
because i thought that you wanted to hurt her !
well , then , we &apos;ll just have to go back
and get her , won &apos;t we ?
no !
no !
i @-@ i want to trust you . i do .
but you still can &apos;t . i understand .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s too much .
i will get my daughter back .
and i &apos;ll do it all on my own .
april 15th .
what ?
your birthday .
just thought you might want to know .
how do you know that ?
tortured it out of a miller &apos;s daughter .
don &apos;t worry .
i took care of her , too .
for you .
i know you don &apos;t need me .
you don &apos;t need anyone .
but if you change your mind ...
and decide you want me ...
i &apos;ll be waiting for you ...
at home .
just like i always have .
