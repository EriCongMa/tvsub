you don &apos;t want us talking to you in your neighborhood .
and don &apos;t go anywhere . we got a unit watching the beauty shop .
i &apos;m getting lights and a wax .
we &apos;ll wait .
janice , hi .
listen , i can &apos;t stay .
i just brought bobby junior a couple of xbox games ...
a friend of mine burned for him .
jojo . hi . what are you doing here ?
janice , look at you .
i made bobby and the kids some of my chicken marsala .
it &apos;s times like this , i remember when i lost mikey .
it &apos;s impossible to think about food ...
but like the president says : &quot; we have to keep going . &quot;
the family &apos;s got to eat .
i &apos;m picking up the kids after school , bobby . no argument .
he &apos;s hanging in , though , aren &apos;t you , bobby ?
leave those . the girl &apos;s coming today .
then i better do these pots at least .
i &apos;ve seen rigoberta with those copper tuffies . what she &apos;s done to this teflon .
any time you want to drop sophia and little bobby off , don &apos;t be shy .
i mean it . my kids would love it .
how is michael junior doing on the ritalin ?
the way they medicate kids today ... it &apos;s the answer for everything .
then they wonder why teenagers get hooked on drugs .
if a child had diabetes , you &apos;d give him insulin .
i didn &apos;t mean it like that . bobby &apos;s got to come home anyway .
karen always made him do his homework before dinner ... or it didn &apos;t get done .
the chicken , bobby ...
put it in a 350 oven for 20 minutes . you just want to heat it .
and if you have some egg noodles ... it &apos;s better the first night . enjoy .
thank you , jojo .
everybody &apos;s been so nice . i &apos;ll bet .
look at all these casseroles people brought .
stuffed shells.gabriella.
ziti . karen made that .
i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s her last ziti before she died .
i didn &apos;t know .
i loved her so much .
i thank god for every day we had together .
she was an angel .
i know . she was special .
miss la cerva .
agent harris . we met . this is agent sanseverino .
hi , adriana . eat shit , danielle .
or whatever the fuck your name is .
get you a latte ? scone ?
i just want you people to leave me alone . how many times i have to tell you ?
i don &apos;t know anything .
you people are just trying to scare me . nobody &apos;s trying to hurt christopher .
what was he doing in yonkers last night ?
what ? i don &apos;t know .
somebody saw him having drinks ... at the renaissance inn
with an individual named chip zoto .
christopher ever mention a chip zoto , or just plain chip ?
no . here &apos;s what &apos;s problematic .
you don &apos;t even know where your boyfriend is .
how do you know if he &apos;s in trouble ?
he &apos;s into heroin , organized crime .
he &apos;s associating with some very dangerous people ...
not to mention tony soprano himself . see , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
tony would never let anything happen to christopher .
they &apos;re cousins , he loves him .
he loved pussy bonpensiero . what happened to him ?
he went in the witness protection program .
dwight ? he went into the program ?
you know anything about that ?
no .
i think we would &apos;ve heard .
and your uncle richie , i suppose he &apos;s in the program , too .
he is .
isn &apos;t he ?
this is a way out for you . you have your whole life in front of you .
we &apos;d like to see you two have a chance .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna get back . where are you going ?
you &apos;re gonna be working with agent sanseverino here .
what ?
why ?
it &apos;s for your own safety .
and you know what we were talking about ? about the little creatures ?
good luck with that . i mean it .
fuck you .
the more you can tell us , the more we can help you and christopher .
he doesn &apos;t need your help . he can take care of himself .
you want some water ?
how &apos;s tony been lately ?
i have no fucking idea . i told you already .
been over to the house ?
i don &apos;t go over there .
hardly ever .
that should be your area of focus , if possible .
i don &apos;t feel so good .
a little more salt ?
no , it &apos;s delicious .
listen , i was talking to cousin brian ...
i &apos;m seeing ginsberg tomorrow .
no , not that . he gave me a free tip on a medical stock that &apos;s gonna move soon .
he said we should put $ 10,000 in it .
$ 10,000 ?
it &apos;s not that much .
right .
it &apos;s not a meaningful investment .
that much of dell computer bought in 1989 is worth $ 5 million today .
we don &apos;t have that kind of money on hand right now .
things are tight .
don &apos;t you read the papers ? the economy ?
it sounded like a wonderful opportunity .
what are you gonna do ?
waldorf @-@ astoria for horses back here . groom , trainer , three meals a day .
no , watch out for the goat , it butts .
my nina lento cooked goat .
what &apos;s it doing here ?
horses like company . seabiscuit had a horse he traveled with .
how do you like that ? you own a horse , tony ?
please , as his accountant ...
i thought about it a couple times ... but it &apos;s an animal , it &apos;s a commitment .
don &apos;t tell me with the buck shins again ?
no , she &apos;s fine . we had a great morning .
jesus , that &apos;s a beautiful horse .
she &apos;ll be a bottle of lepage
if she don &apos;t win this race .
bubbala , you want a sure thing ?
buy bonds . lois is the best trainer here .
this ciuccio , he sells me a horse . the next week it starts losing .
i don &apos;t know what got into her . she ran the whole race ahead by two lengths ...
and then she just stopped in the backstretch .
stopped ?
slowed down , finished fourth .
as in out of the money .
maybe you should try holding her back . keep something for the finish .
horse is a front runner . she likes running up front .
so , what if she don &apos;t win ? i have to agree with lois here .
a horse has style , you don &apos;t fuck with it .
it &apos;s her kind of track today . fast .
she did draw the one hole . done , said , finished .
tony , all due respect , i &apos;m inclined to defer to the experts .
me , too . all right .
wire to wire .
and tell that midget not to be shy with the whip .
if only his mother had taken that advice .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re wearing to court ?
i &apos;ll get it .
now what ?
it &apos;s your niece .
morning , uncle jun &apos; .
great tie .
what &apos;s that ?
dinner tonight .
it &apos;s some delicious chicken marsala .
murf , 350 oven for 20 minutes , just so it &apos;s hot .
and if you have some egg noodles ...
go bring the car around .
where you going ?
i &apos;m getting my jacket .
i &apos;ll bring it . go get the car , we &apos;re late .
i got to go upstairs , get some change for the parking .
i &apos;ve been meaning to get down to the court to show my solidarity .
but this thing with bobby ... he needs help with those kids .
he needs help ? i &apos;m on trial for my life .
he &apos;s gonna get through this .
when ? i &apos;m waiting like patience on a monument .
you really depend on him , don &apos;t you ?
this one , he drives like a little old lady . gas , brake , gas , brake .
you know , i remember daddy said ... that someday bobby would be your linchpin .
my brother said that ?
bobby was still a head waiter when johnny died .
bobby &apos;s doing better . we had a very healing day yesterday .
i helped him go through karen &apos;s things for saint vincent de paul .
psychologically , that &apos;s enormous .
yesterday ?
bobby was home ? why ?
he had to take care of something for me , that &apos;s why .
what was it ? goddamn it .
each of us is alone in the fucking universe .
so this estate planning shit ...
carmela wants it , and i got nothing against getting well set up .
half of these cidrules live one day to the next .
the blue chip portfolio like your cousin &apos;s suggesting ...
to keep pace with inflation ?
if it makes your wife happy , go with god .
i &apos;m supposed to make the money , she takes care of the house .
that &apos;s the way it should be .
carmela &apos;s a smart woman . if we start winning in the market ...
it &apos;s gonna be intel this and coca @-@ cola that . it &apos;ll never end .
this other thing your cousin advised ...
the life insurance trust ? big red flag .
what ? the kid said there was tremendous tax advantages .
to carmela , when you die .
but present day , if something unforeseen should arise ...
divorce , say ... that type of trust is irrevocable .
it can &apos;t be changed . you have to petition the court , and even then ...
don &apos;t get me wrong . a trust , per se , is a good thing .
avoids probate , prying eyes ... but there &apos;s other ways to go .
such as an inter vivos , a living trust .
here they go . they &apos;re in the gate , and they &apos;re off .
come on , baby !
here we go .
out of the gate , it &apos;s vision be mine , miss rae rae and zucker &apos;s mother ...
going for the lead . yeah boy right there on the outside ...
pie @-@ o @-@ my settling into fifth .
go , goddamn it , go !
come on , move up !
come on , baby , come on !
i hate this fucking pygmy . what &apos;s he doing ?
get her out of there ! move her up !
vision be mine following by a length , pie @-@ o @-@ my back two lengths ...
no ! i got $ 5,000 on her .
she &apos;s gonna make it , here we go ! come on , baby ! come on , girl !
zucker &apos;s mother , miss rae rae , vision be mine , and pie @-@ o @-@ my ...
joins the front runners . she &apos;s coming around ! jesus , look at her go !
making a move on the outside ...
it &apos;s pie @-@ o @-@ my , with a tremendous push , with tremendous speed .
come on , girl ! at the top of the stretch it &apos;s pie @-@ o @-@ my ...

i &apos;m rich ! $ 5,000 at eight @-@ to @-@ one !
heading for the winner &apos;s circle is pie @-@ o @-@ my , owned by inez munoz .
who is that ? that &apos;s his girlfriend .
i &apos;ll give you a shot in the fucking head . &quot; my girlfriend . &quot;
it &apos;s his maid . right , the racing license .
miss munoz , as the owner of the winning horse ...
you &apos;ll receive an 8 x 10 glossy in two to four weeks .
you , anthony .
what did you say ? &quot; hold her back . &quot;
you are not going unthanked . i &apos;m giving a taste of my win .
hey , inez !
come here , have some champagne . mr. ralph , i don &apos;t know ...
there he is . i wanna congratulate you .
i asked , and she was there . you know , not for nothing .
the horse won , but that was not the agreed upon strategy .
nicky didn &apos;t sit on it . she was bumped
out of the gate and got stuck in a speed trap .
so this coming behind , this was a fluke ?
this man here , he knew . we all get lucky .
no , right is right , anthony .
fluke , escolar , whatever the fuck ... i &apos;m giving you your taste .
your money &apos;s no good . - i insist .
she ran your race . you called it.end of story .
$ 300 , $ 400 , $ 500 , $ 600 .
and i need $ 150 more this week for a.j. &apos; s football cleats .
in my day , they were $ 50 .
$ 50 ? that &apos;s what i pay to get your suits out of the cleaners .
so you got those papers for me to sign ?
brian &apos;s ?
i told you i &apos;d talk to ginsberg .
got a pen ?
anthony soprano , that is wonderful .
that &apos;s so great , i am so impressed .
&quot; authorization to open an account . &quot; it &apos;s wherever there &apos;s a little red arrow .
and there .
you need to sign the agency papers here , too .
it gives brian authorization to buy stocks on our behalf .
where the little circles are here , initials ?
you will not regret this , tony , truly .
this is the best thing for all of us . it &apos;ll give us such peace of mind .
wait , there &apos;s one more .
i &apos;m not gonna sign that one .
why not ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea .
but this is the trust . it &apos;s in case something happens to you .
i &apos;m not gonna sign it .
you have to .
remember your children , your wife ? so they don &apos;t end up out on the street ?
yeah , well , there &apos;s better ones . &quot; in vitro &quot; something .
what ? what &apos;s wrong with this one ?
it &apos;s irrevocable .
we don &apos;t wanna get locked in .
to what ?
&quot; float like a butterfly , sting like a bee . &quot; excuse me ?
it &apos;s the government , carm . you &apos;ve got to be flexible .
jesus , mary and joseph .
come on , carm , be fair . i gave you two out of three .
you gave me ?
in here , hon .
what &apos;re you doing in bed ? we got dinner with tony and carmela .
i can &apos;t go . i &apos;m sick .
what do you mean ?
i don &apos;t know , i got chills and a fever .
i think i &apos;m getting the flu . i shouldn &apos;t go up there .
come on , get dressed . couple of drinks , it &apos;ll kill the germs .
you better go without me .
but you have to go .
this is the inner sanctum , here . i &apos;m not just a relative anymore .
you think paulie and his cumares ever get invited to dinner with them ?
i &apos;m sorry .
maybe if i just sleep ...
nothing ever goes my way .
is that sausage ? my mom made it with hamburger .
see ?
just a spoonful , jan. that &apos;s enough , thanks .
why don &apos;t you kids tell daddy what we saw on the way home from school today ?
the fuji blimp over willowbrook mall ?
so ?
you kids seemed to like it when you saw it .
you begged me to follow it .
it was nice of you to pick them up for me .
and making dinner .
enjoy , everybody .
it does smell good , doesn &apos;t it ?
did you eat yet ?
i &apos;ll get something at home .
no , it &apos;s all right , isn &apos;t it , kids ?

that &apos;s rude .

i &apos;m the one barging in . you go right in there .
you know how to set up the tv trays . you want a little more ?
okay . it &apos;s pretty good , actually .
thank you , bobby .
i told you i don &apos;t want them to be spoiled because they lost their mother .
i saw my uncle today .
jesus .
that &apos;s right .
is he mad ?
what &apos;s going on , bobby ? what were you supposed to do ?
union business .
what &apos;s going on ?
this election coming up , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m the one that should &apos;ve been in that car ... not karen .
and junior &apos;s been so good to me , and i &apos;m letting him down .
fuck him ! he only thinks of himself , selfish old fuck .
now listen to me . i know my uncle , he &apos;s a patient man .
but he &apos;s at the point , if you don &apos;t do your job ...
he &apos;ll find somebody who will , you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
all your effort , all the years you put in getting your ticket punched ...
you &apos;ll be a nobody . i don &apos;t care anymore .
that &apos;s the problem .
i don &apos;t care if i live or die .
we lose that luxury when we have children .
i remember my son harpo , when my husband left us ...
i had both barrels of a shotgun in my mouth ...
but then just one thought of harpo ...
my little boy without his mother ...
every day is worse than the last .
my uncle loves you .
he needs you .
so you &apos;re going to get up tomorrow morning ... and you &apos;re going to get dressed ,
and you &apos;re going to get in that car ...
and you &apos;re going to do what needs to be done ,
aren &apos;t you ?

i &apos;m sure you guys got grievances , but dick hoffman ?

i can see why your local puts their faith in you to do the right thing .
i &apos;m just saying , if it was me ...

she &apos;s a pretty good cook .
since when ? everybody steers clear of her food .
she made lasagna the other night , delicious .

sweet sausage ? in little pieces ?
a layer of basil leaves right underneath the cheese ?
that &apos;s right .

ralph and them wanted to know if tony was here . why , is he going to be ?
you don &apos;t know what this guy did for me .
i do .
not getting my stripes . something i can &apos;t talk about .
something that was ruining my whole life , and he made it right .
what i owe him , i would follow that man into hell .
but why do they have to come here ? i don &apos;t understand .
this place isn &apos;t bugged . the cops and the feds don &apos;t know about it .
probably in time they will , until then ...
