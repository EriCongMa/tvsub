37-year-old male, unconscious and unresponsive with an idioventricular rhythm.
Obvious head trauma, brain matter evident on the scene,
15 minutes out.
You heard 'em. Somebody page shepherd. Let's move.
创伤外科医生
Got it.
We're on trauma rotation, so it's our job to take point
外科住院医生
外科住院医生
and assess each medical emergency as it comes in.
Let's get X-ray in here. You better be precise.
Talk to me, Dr. Grey.
His peripheral I.V.'s blown. Pressure's plummeting.
Running a code can be chaotic.
You know, sometimes the best thing you can do
is know, you know, when to get out of the way.
Someone page Dr. Shepherd!
V- tach!
Charging to 200. No pulse. Push one of epi.
starting compressions.
Give me those paddles.
Fluids are wide open. Charging, 200.
3 of epi.
神经外科主任
I was paged down to assess the patient's head trauma.
When they stabilize him, I'll go in, and I'll do my stuff.
Hold compressions, please. Let's see what we have.
Got a rhythm.
Does he have a pulse?
That's it. He's basically brain dead.
Um, excuse me one second, okay?
Dr. Hunt.
We're still gonna have to crossmatch him.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Hey. Hey, look at this.
Blood type's a match, skin's a match,
整形外科主任
Age, size, gender, all matching.
We got our guy.
We got our guy?
We got our guy.
Oh, you picked a good night to start filming.
Yeah.
This is gonna be fun.
We just got a call from Dr. Sloan.
He said to hurry over, so we got out of bed and came in.
Right in. I mean, I was in such a hurry, I forgot my shoes.
Look. I've still got my slippers on.
Oh, we've been waiting for this for so long.
Today is the day. Today is my transplant day.
Yay, transplant day.
Gonna get me some arms!
Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital,
home to some of the finest, most influential doctors in the country.
Several months ago, a gunman roamed these hse halls,
leaving 11 people dead and even more injured.
Today we visit the survivors--
their patients, their triumphs,
and their disappointments.
This is <i>Seattle Medical, Road to Recovery</i>.
Things have changed since the shooting, sure.
For one thing, uh, over the last month,
外科主任
we have installed a number of new, uh, security measures.
Um, we're trying to make it safer for the hospital,
uh, the doctors, and-- and-- and the patients.
So what-- what--
come on. We go through this every morning.
It's me. I swear.
I just-- I have a different hair color. That's all.
It's-- Chief! Chief, would you please--
Would you come tell'em that I'm me? Please.
Um, excu-excuse me a moment.
What's going on?
We, uh, we are fourth-year s- surgical residents.
And, uh, we're friends, you know, good friends.
Mm. It's pretty impossible to work this closely
And not become good friends.
Can we call respiratory to get a vent down here?
What's the O-2 sat?
83.
He's starting to have arrhythmia.
为同事做了紧急手术
He's tachycardic and hypotensive. We need another blood pressure.
Decreased breath sounds on the left. Let's get a chest tube.
His blood pressure's dropping.
Uh, sure, I mean, going through something like that,
it's brought us closer.
Not that we weren't close before.
I mean, ask anyone. We're close.
Yeah, Dr. Yang and my wife sometimes have sleepovers...
in my bed with me in it.
So yeah, yes, it's brought us closer for sure.
He needs a thoracotomy.
Right, right, right.
O-2 sats dropping. Yes, please.
I'll alert the O.R.
Where's that A.B.G.?
Sterile drape.
Here. Take over compressions.
I'll get it.
Great. Thank you.
It's, uh, 7:00 a.m.
I've been here two hours.
And, uh, my interns, they got here before that.
外科住院医生
They check on the patients and report to me
before I check on the patients and report to my attending.
Lily, I told you already,
turn it down or put in the headphones.
The rest of us don't have Bieber fever,
whatever that is.
How have I changed since the shooting?
I don't know.
Uh, I got this.
Uh, today I'm going back to Seattle Grace
for my colostomy reversal.
病人
Oh, uh, babe, did we remember my robe and my fuzzy socks?
玛丽的丈夫
Yes, and yes,
if by "we," you mean me, because you forgot.
I was supposed to get this surgery months ago,
But... well, the shooting happened instead.
Did you get the parking ticket?
Yeah, in my pocket.
I haven't been back to the hospital since that day.
I don't know how it will feel to be back.
That's right, it's Portman. P- o-r-t-m-a-n.
Uh, and can you tell me where I can get this validated?
I'll take care of it.
Thanks.
普外科医生
Hey.
Hey, Dr. B.
Yeah, I don't generally make it a habit
to hug my patients.
Yeah, well, when you get paged 9-1-1,
You don't walk. You never walk.
儿科医生
Okay, talk.
Okay.
持续缺氧两分钟她就会死亡
God, I can't get past the obstruction.
Damn it. How long?
Five minutes.
Damn it.
Yes. Yes, do it now.
no, no, no, Lily, Lily,
I know. I know. This is scary. You stopped breathing,
And so we had to take you to the O.R.
and put a tube in your neck to help get you air.
No, no, no. You can't talk, okay?
But we called your mom at work, and she's on her way.
Lily was admitted with respiratory distress last night.
She has a, uh, growth on her windpipe.
It's benign except for, there's nothing benign
about something that's blocking your airway.
She's had surgeries to remove it in the past,
but it's aggressive, it keeps recurring,
and obviously, it's gotten worse, much worse.
Okay, this is the nurse's button.
If you need anything, you push it.
I mean push it a lot. Don't worry about being annoying.
Push it till they come in here.
It's okay. It's all right.
Here.
Not too loud, okay?
It happens more than you think,
having to do a procedure on a kid with no parents around.
Some of these kids are in here for weeks.
The parents usually can't take off that much work.
But I mean, we try to help out.
We have these beds, we call 'em parent cots,
for the parents to sleep in.
But a lot of these kids spend a lot of time alone.
Just works out that way.
Doesn't mean they're bad parents.
They're just, uh, busy parents.
I found out last night that he...
had been in an accident.
手臂捐献者的妻子
Just before the phone rang, I had this...
sinking feeling.
Motorcycles...
Donorcycles-- isn't that what they call them?
故人们戏称其为"donorcycle"
They called me in here because even though Sam's a donor,
they need special consent for something like this.
I know Sam would want to donate whatever he could,
so of course, yes, they-- they could...
they could take his arms.
Absolutely. I have no problem with that.
Although, uh...
it's hard, you k--
the thought of somebody else, you know,
holding his hand.
See that? That could be a problem.
What if we try a bypass instead?
Derek and I? We go way back.
We grew up together, went to med school together.
He's...
He's kinda like my better half.
Not the better-looking half, mind you.
So when I heard he got shot...
Every day, we give bad news to patients.
We tell them their loved ones are hurt...
or dying...
or dead.
And for the first time in my life,
I understood what that feels like.
It feels like .
No, no, you're thinking like a nerve guy.
I am a nerve guy.
Goes blood supply, then nerves.
Actually, it's tendons,
then blood supply, then nerves.
Um, hello, what about the bones?
矫形外科医生
We estimate the surgery will take
anywhere from 15 to 20 hours.
We'll have two O.R.s going at once.
There will be five teams of surgeons,
one team for each arm,
and then a fifth just to harvest veins from the leg.
You know there's only been one successful
bilateral arm transplant in the country?
In the world.
In the world.
Yeah, I wouldn't go so far as, uh, calling us medical Titans,
but... we are.
Not the first time I've been called a Titan.
Right now,
I am prepping the donor body
to extract antibodies from his blood.
This is all in preparation for later,
when we'll remove, uh, bone marrow from the donor,
and then we'll infuse the marrow into Zack
to reduce the chances of his body rejecting the arms,
which is huge.
More than huge.
I mean, I'm no medical Titan, but, uh...
still it's pretty damn cool.
Uh, yeah, Zack lost his arms four years ago.
It was an accident at work.
He is, uh, he was a logger.
So it coulda gone either way.
I mean, it-- this thing coulda come between us
or it could've brought us closer together,
and for us...
I think it's brought us closer.
Literally. I have to wipe his for him.
Okay, really?
That's the way you want to talk about
in front of everyone right now?
Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry. I'd cover my face, but I don't have any hands.
You been good since I last saw you?
Busy.
Bill and I left town right after the shooting,
and... pretty much never looked back.
So far, we've been to Paris,
Morocco, Alaska...
a cruise through the Baltic.
What?
Blew through our savings,
but... hey, life is short, right?
Sure is.
Is there anything I'm looking forward to
once my surgery is done?
Babies.
Lots and lots of babies.
Deep breath.
Another.
Enter security access code.
You're sure? You're sure?
I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure.
Enter security access code.
There are some kinks with the new security system,
but-- but there are always kinks with something...
n-new. Ah.
But we're-- we're working them out.
We got this, uh, new, state-of-the-art
like, lockdown system.
To isolate different areas of the hospital in case of an emergency.
Yeah, 'cause, um supposedly, the last emergency,
there were... some people wandering around.
Even with the kinks, I think people feel safer,
which is important, yeah.
Uh, sorry to interrupt, Chief.
I just-- I got your page, but hey, I can come back.
Oh, nonsense.
Congratulations. I just heard the big news,
and I am so proud of you.
Uh, our very own, um, Dr. Robbins here
has been award
the prestigious, um, Carter Madison Grant.
Yeah, I haven't told that many people yet.
A Carter-Madison Grant? Nobody wins those.
I mean, nobody normal. I mean, just sort of
those brainy, scientist types who are from Germany and Sweden.
Oh, my god! You won! Are you kidding?
Nope. She's not kidding.
Oh, come here.
Thank you.
No, I didn't apply for the grant because of the shooting.
There are major gaps
in the care of children in developing countries.
Global health initiatives exist for things like malaria,
uh, infectious diseases, immunizations,
but not for pediatric surgery,
and with this grant...
I could start to change that.
Well, I applied for this thing two years ago.
I was a completely different person.
You know, I was new here, um, a surgical fellow...
single.
But now I have people here,
important people, which...
complicates things.
But... this is bigger than me.
This is-- this is the opportunity of a lifetime.
So...
yeah,
of course I'm accepting the grant.
That just means I'm... moving to Africa.
Coming up on <i>Seattle Medical</i>... How long has he been coding?!
Um, Dr. Torres, have you seen this?
oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Something like this could ruin everything.
Well, I mean, not just anyone's a good arm donation candidate.
Not every candidate wants donated arms.
Most, uh, amputee patients opt to continue using prosthetics.
When you think about it,
We're attaching two cadaver arms
to another living person's body.
That's the kind of thing
that could really mess with someone's head.
Not to mention the rehabilitation time.
Recovering from something like this, it takes years.
Well, the screening process is, uh, extensive.
We have to ensure that the recipient
is stable mentally and physically,
determined, patient, very patient.
And that's all before you even begin looking for an arm.
Uh, in this case, we've been looking for arms for Zachary
for over two years.
It's been a long time coming.
Um, Dr. Torres.
Uh, you've probably seen this,
but-- but h-have you seen this?
oh, my god. No.
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, um, page Sloan right now.
a tattoo?
It's just so unfair that something like this
外科住院医生
外科住院医生
could ruin everything.
Hi. Is it true?
Are you guys scrubbing in on the...
外科住院医生
double arm transplant?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
What's wrong with you?
It's a very real concern, actually.
The patient could easily reject the arms,
not just physically but emotionally.
The first-ever hand transplant recipient
ultimately asked to have the hand removed.
Yeah, he said he couldn't connect to it,
that it felt like dead weight sewn on to his body,
that the hand wasn't and never would be his.
Imagine looking at a tattoo of your donor's wife's name
every day to remind you that these aren't your arms.
You're making me nervous. What's wrong?
Is there a problem with the arms?
Oh, god. There's a problem with the arms.
Maybe.
There's a tattoo on one of the arms
of the name "Nicole."
I love the name Nicole.
Me, too. I love it. We couldn't love it more.
I say we rename our dog Nicole.
I'm gonna name myself Nicole.
Change my name.
If it means I can still get those arms,
then... Nicole is my new favorite name.
Yeah.
I was-- I was not expecting that.
He got that tattoo exactly one year after we met.
He took me to the tattoo shop and told me
he was gonna get this tattoo
to show me just how much he loved me, which...
is when I'm pretty sure I called him an idiot or something worse.
You don't declare your love for someone by getting a tattoo.
You do normal things, like--
like plan a nice date, or-- or write a poem,
or hell, drop down on one knee and propose.
You don't brand yourself with another person's name.
Which is when Sam said, "Okay,"
and he got down on one knee,
pulled out a ring and proposed...
on the spot.
After that, every time...
even if we were fighting
or I was mad at him because he forgot to take the garbage cans out or...
I'd catch a glimpse of that tattoo,
and I'd remember, this guy loves me.
Even if the garbage is gonna smell up the yard for a week...
he loves me.
Loved me.
I don't even like kids.
Come on.
Pediatric surgery
has nothing to do with liking kids.
All right, Lily. I need you to stay still, okay?
Or you're gonna mess up the test.
I'm gonna be right over there in that booth,
and that's how it goes.
Lily, you can't have this in the machine, okay?
I'm sorry.
Hey, look, guys,
why don't you back off for a little while, okay?
Hey. It's gonna be okay.
I mean, you go into peds because it's elite,
you know, uh, hard-core, the best of the best.
Na na na, fire and rain
instead of driving me insane
But I can't stay mad at you for anything...
Did you know that there are
only 38 pediatric surgery fellowship spots in the country?
The country.
I mean, uh, to compare, cardiothoracic has 120.
Pediatric surgery is the elite of the elite.
So yeah, I'd consider specializing...
in pediatric surgery, for sure.
But not because of the kids.
Definitely not because of the kids.
...And I wouldn't change a thing...
Airway's clear.
You know, the truth is that
it's actually a good thing that...
the shooting happened here instead of somewhere else,
because we are better equipped to handle trauma.
I mean, we see trauma every day. It's our job.
We got a stab wound there.
Yeah, I-I got it.
Put him on a monitor.
Thank you.
Uh, he needs surgery.
Okay, let's pack it,
stabilize him, and get him upstairs.
Right away, doctor.
Right. Right.
There's another incoming trauma on his way in,
so I'm just gonna stay down here and handle that.
Yeah, I mean, trauma is a part of our job,
so improvising and thinking on our feet,
that's what we're trained to do.
No, it's not strange Dr. Yang isn't coming with me.
I was available, so I'll take this guy,
she'll take the next one. It's first come, first serve.
Everyone wants to get in that O.R.
We're surgeons. We live to cut.
It's who we are.
It's not too late, you know?
We could move up our next trip,
skip out of here, and -- and just catch a plane tonight.
I mean, you've been fine this long without the surgery.
You'd be fine a little longer.
Colostomy reversal is a very basic surgery.
On a typical day, I might do two or three in a row.
Uh, this was the surgery
I was supposed to perform on Mary that day.
The day that...
that -- that, um...
Anyway, um,
medically speaking,
she was getting a little stoma prolapse
and some electrolyte imbalances,
so it's good that we're doing the surgery now.
Good to get it over with.
So we just got Lily's labs back,
and I'm taking 'em to Dr. Robbins.
They don't, uh...
I mean, I'm just saying,
I think that at least you could be happy.
Well, I thought we were hap --
Uh, should I come back?
No, whatever. We're done anyway.
Uh, you have -- you have Lily's results?
Well, it's her decision, obviously.
It's an incredible opportunity.
I mean, you don't just, uh,
turn down a Carter Madison grant.
Nobody turns down a Carter Madison grant.
I mean, I-I... I know that. I...
I understand that. I do.
I mean, if the situation were reversed...
Actually, no. You know what no.
If the situation were reversed, I would turn the thing down.
I wouldn't even consider
moving to another continent right now.
But I'm not her.
So, uh...
like I said, it's an incredible opportunity.
Hope you've got that bone saw ready,
'cause I am really in the mood to cut off some arms.
Unfortunately, because of her prior surgeries,
Lily has fistulas
that make removing her tumor that much more difficult.
The tumor is now so large
that it's impinging on her airway and esophagus.
莉莉的母亲
Removing the tumor would mean
removing Lily's entire trachea,
which means...
Lily wouldn't be able to breathe at all.
The other thing that's changed for me
most since the shooting is that...
now I feel like...
there's always something that we can do,
'cause I should've died.
You know, I was shot point-blank.
So, uh...
there's always something that we can do.
So you're saying...
that if you operate...
it's a death sentence,
and if you don't operate, it's a death sentence?
So in a few minutes,
we'll be ready to completely
detach the arms from the donor.
Why use zigzag incisions?
To get maximum exposure.
Good. See what I'm doing here?
I'm tagging each vessel, artery and vein
so we know exactly how
to hook them up to the recipient.
It's kind of like the back of your TV.
You need to know which connection goes where,
or you wind up with sound and no picture
or a picture and no sound.
The minute we remove the arms from the donor,
the tissue starts to die,
so we have to work fast, really fast.
We have a very limited window
to complete this part of the surgery.
Okay.
Okay, let's get started.
You don't understand.
I was sent to get coffee for Dr. Sloan
because he needs his caffeine right now
to get through the most amazing surgery
that is happening right now in O.R. 2.
So I-I'm pretty sure it's not okay
to be late for the making of medical history,
so you need to let me through, okay,
to get to that surgery, to get Dr. Sloan his caffeine,
to witness medical history being made.
I-I -- my I.D. is valid, I promise.
Let me take a look.
Yeah, she -- she swiped it a couple times.
It didn't go through.
Just go. Just go.
Enter security access code.
Hey. Hey. Anybody?
Enter security access code.
Nurse! come here.
Dr. Avery. Dr. Avery, your patient!
Enter security access code.
Enter security access code.
Avery! Dr. Avery!
Hold on! Dr. Avery!
Enter security...
So we're about nine hours in.
Uh, Dr. Torres has finished attaching the donor arm bones
to the recipient with titanium plates and screws,
and now they are beginning to attach the tendons.
I'm on it.
Where have you been?
Has getting shot changed me?
Um, I don't think
I love my job any more or any less.
Um, I don't think I'm...
I'm a-a better doctor or worse.
Uh, if anything it's made me grateful,
um, to be here.
So yeah, getting shot has changed me
in the sense that I feel lucky.
We've reconnected the arteries and veins.
But we need to check the circulation before we continue.
What we're gonna do now
is release the tourniquets one arm at a time
and then look to see if blood flows into the vessels.
Okay, moment of truth.
Releasing the tourniquet.
Arm's pinking up!
That's good. Good job, everybody.
The commute's tough.
We've been coming here
since Lily's tumor got diagnosed three years ago.
It's just the two of us, just Lily and I.
We live over three hours away,
so it makes it difficult for me
to come more than twice a week and weekends.
I hate leaving her for that long.
But I just want what's best for her.
I want her to live.
Dr. Robbins came to me, and she said
there might be something they could do for Lily after all --
something experimental.
Um, that's why you come to a place like this, you know?
Because even if it is a commute, three hours on the road,
it's nothing if -- if it'll save Lily's life.
We've completed a stent to temporarily help Lily breathe,
and now we're gonna remove part of her twelfth rib.
See? It's just one more example of how our doctors here rise.
First a Carter Madison grant winner,
and now cutting-edge...
regenerative medicine.
Well, there's no artificial replacement for a trachea.
We know that. But then I remembered a study,
and I thought, well... what if it isn't artificial?
We're gonna use some of Lily's own cells
to manufacture her a new trachea.
Grow it in the lab, remove the damaged organ,
replace it with a newer model.
Outstanding.
Absolutely outstanding, Dr. Robbins.
Let me in here. Move. Avery, Avery!
Avery, look, I was waiting in radiation.
How's the patient?
Damn it! How long has he been coding?!
Avery, you're gonna break his ribs.
Okay, okay, okay.
O - okay, okay, okay.
The new security system? Yeah, I'm not a fan.
Compressions only last for so long,
so you call whoever you need to call,
You override whatever you need to override,
and you open the door before I report you
for the wrongful death of a patient!
Avery.
Avery, it's okay. Just hang in there, okay?
Avery.
All right, you can stop now.
Someone else can take over.
Avery, look at me. Look at me. You can stop now.
Avery, Avery, it's okay. It's okay.
It's been, uh...
hard...
since the shooting.
I, uh, I lost some fr -- some friends that day.
You learn to think about things differently.
Like, um, like buttoning a button --
You can't -- you can't do that,
you know, even with the hooks, so...
now I just buy Zack T-shirts and hoodies.
He can usually get those on by himself
by using his hooks and his feet.
And, uh, I help him bathe in the morning,
and... well, brush his teeth and shave.
It took me --
it took me a long time to get the hang of that.
But it's all in the wrist, I've learned.
It's late.
I thought I w -- I would have an update by now.
So what's the big deal? You'll visit her.
She'll visit you. It's just a plane ride.
Um, can we not talk about this right now?
Arms getting cyanotic.
The vessel attachments are all good.
Uh, picture. We've got picture and no sound.
Excuse me?
Move over. Just move over.
Any update?
What? Just tell me.
Um...
there was a possible complication with one of the arms.
Complication?
There's a clot,
and they're trying to, uh, restore blood flow.
But...
He could lose it, couldn't he?
Well...
one arm's better than none, right?
Torres, do you need help?
I can retract that for you.
Want me to patch that?
Just give me a second.
Are you sure you don't want me to...
I know what I'm doing...
Torres, do you want me to patch this?
Just give me a second.
Okay, I know what I'm doing. I just need a second.
Everybody, shut up.
Okay. All right.
There. Picture and sound, I think.
Yeah.
Good job.
Good. Nicely done.
Basically, we break the cartilage down
to its cellular level and turn it into a protein liquid.
We build a scaffolding to hold the liquid,
then we cook it in an incubator to let it grow.
This is the incubator.
We're gonna grow the trachea in here first.
And then once it's big enough, we're gonna insert it
into Lily's abdomen till it gets stronger.
It'll be there a few months.
Then we'll take that new trachea
and replace her old one.
Some might say that a shooting would set people back.
Then you look at residents like Dr. Karev
and attendings like Dr. Robbins,
and you see their -- their innovative thinking,
their resilience.
You see them becoming reinvested in -- in medicine.
It's inspiring, isn't it?
I've mobilized the two intestinal segments,
and I've stapled,
and...
that's it.
Textbook. In an out in an hour.
Time to close.
It went well.
Uh, Mary's being wheeled into recovery right now.
So it's... it's over?
It's over.
Oh, god.
Oh, thank you.
Oh. Oh. Thank you.
Thank you.
This is, uh,
one surgery I am happy... to have finished.
Tonight...
You know, I may very well take the night off.
Go out. Maybe have a drink.
Who knows?
Oh, man.
Oh, gentlemen and lady... hey.
We gave a man arms today.
We did.
I like to think of it more as I gave a man arms today.
The rest of you just helped.
Another round for everybody but my friend here.
Come on.
That's a really nice shirt, by the way.
Where'd you get that, the Special Titan Store?
Hey, you saw the way she saved that arm today?
You want to hear something funny?
She hooked up my TV.
I'm still only getting sound out of one speaker.
So I'll have to irrigate the trachea
with this protein mixture a few times a day,
every day, for the next few weeks...
which means I'll pretty much be living in this hospital
to make sure it gets done right.
That's my priority, is to make sure this trachea grows.
I mean, it's my focus.
I'll basically be eating, breathing and sleeping trachea
for the next month.
Do people treat me differently now, after the shooting?
Uh, well, um... I mean, yeah.
I mean, like, you're here filming me, so...
I mean, like, people like to say what I did was heroic,
but it wasn't. You know, it was just a thing I had to do.
I think people like to have a hero,
And, uh, it-- it-- it...
it makes them feel better to think that,
there in the middle of all that horror,
you-- you know, that there's someone...
special working medical miracles. But...
I mean, I...
I- I mean, I don't--
I don't have super surgical powers.
You know, I mean, I'm-- I- I did what--
Cristina is a hero...
especially to me.
The truth is, is most surgeons
could not have done what she did that day.
If you had seen--
Stop.
If you had seen--
Stop. Please just-- can you...
Can you just stop this?
Can we cut?
Just doing a little construction.
Things are always evolving around here...
for the better.
Always for the better.
Hey, let me give you a hand.
Uh, yeah, I mean, he already has some feeling
at the tops of his new arms, like--
Watch this.
Not bad, huh?
Look right there.
You can barely even see a scar
Where they put the tube in last month.
And now I'm back today to get my new trachea sewn into my belly.
Dr. Karev calls me the human incubator.
He's been sending me photos from the lab, of my new trachea.
See? Look at that right there.
It's really grown.
See? Right there.
I always figured I'd grow up to be a rock star,
but I might consider being a doctor now, too.
I mean, Dr. Karev is pretty cool.
Check it out. Homegrown trachea.
Whatever you do,
just don't screw around and mess up my trachea, okay?
I mean it.
I know you think you're a rock star,
But no mosh pits or crowd surfing.
I mean, Lilith Fair's okay,
But no drinking, or drugs, or smoking, or driving drunk,
or giving your number out to guys you don't know.
You get that I'm 9?
Well, I-I really can't believe it.
The big move to Africa is really just around the corner.
Yes, I would say things are better between us now,
And, uh, yes, we worked it out
even with Arizona moving to Africa.
The fix was, uh, pretty simple, actually. I'm going with her.
Got you some new flowers.
Uh... yellow ones today.
Uh, don't ask me what kind. I have no idea.
They're, uh, they're pretty, though,
just like you.
It's rare,
but sometimes patients do not wake up from surgery.
With every surgery, there is a risk.
In this case, the post-operative C.T. showed no sign of stroke,
no acute bleed.
We've run P.E.T. Scans, M.R.I.S,
tried fluids, pressors.
Basically, that's what I have to go and talk to Bill about today.
Mary has been in a coma since her surgery.
There's no sign of brain activity.
And now she's septic.
Her organs are failing.
Best-case scenario,
Um, she regains some function
and wakes up with extreme deficits, mentally and physically.
But the chance of her...
waking up at this point...
It's hard...
to imagine someone surviving a crazy gunman,
and then not to survive such a simple surgery.
I have to go and tell Bill that it's time.
He has a decision to make.
Well, we went through the scariest thing a person can go through,
and we survived.
So now every day is just a gift.
And we're all just blessed...
blessed to be here,
blessed to be doing what we do best,
Not bad, huh?
which is saving lives...
Every day...
One life at a time,
we're healed...
so we can continue healing others.
Is there any one thing you'll take away from all of this?
