we &apos;re still having trouble contacting the mom for an interview .
any help there ?
jackie ? sure .
she &apos;s probably circling the building .
no , alicia &apos;s mom .
oh.that might prove a little more difficult .
let me check .
good .
now , will gardner , alicia &apos;s boss ,
i still want to interview him .
okay .
how about diane lockhart ?
we &apos;d prefer mr. gardner .
why ?
they went to georgetown together .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
is there anything else , mandy ?
an interview with alicia wouldn &apos;t hurt .
it seems this cover story is
more about alicia than peter .
no , we &apos;ve just had greater access to peter .
am i being sandbagged ?
define sandbagged .
is this a hit piece ?
no .
it is an objective profile of your candidate ...
come on , mandy , you still want something from me .
what &apos;s going on ?
get me face time with alicia florrick .
tell me what &apos;s up first .
i have solid information of an affair .
solid information ?
what ? from the checkout line ?
eli , you asked , so i told .
get me some face time with alicia .
when do you go to press ?
this week .
come on , alicia , come on .
this is alicia florrick . please ...
so , if went looking for your voice recognition software ...
our name would be at the top .
and this is a search engine result
from last year-- june 2011 .
that &apos;s your software ?
margarita motions ?
yes .
julie and mine . we named it after our moms .
margaret and rita .
gizmodo considered it
the top voice recognition software in the country ,
and you resisted being bought out by apple and microsoft .
yes , we wanted to do it on our own , like our hero ,
neil gross .
and what happened after june 2011 ?
we dropped .
overnight , we dropped .
now you have to flip through
28 pages of search results to find us .
and if i were to look for your software by using your name ... ?
try it . type it in .
&quot; do you want margarita mixes ? &quot;
it always corrects that way .
and you say this happened overnight ?
yes , it did . june 13 , 2011 .
and why do you know that date so specifically ?
well , a week earlier ,
we were approached by a sales rep from chumhum ,
mr. gross &apos;s company .
they wanted us to buy ads for the search engine ,
and we said no ; we wanted to save the money for hiring .
and then a week later , you dropped to page 28 in their results ?
yes .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re suing for unfair trade practices ?
yes . the problem is ,
if the search engine doesn &apos;t acknowledge you ,
you don &apos;t exist .
we went bankrupt .
we lost our money , our parents &apos; money ,
our friends &apos; money .
we read your book ...
mr. gross , we went to the same college .
we &apos;re just trying to do what you did .
objection , your honor .
please ask the witness to refrain from addressing my client .
would you like me to ask her to not look at him , too ?
okay , do i have to separate you two ?
can you please speak up ?
nothing further , your honor .
ms. sun ...
let me read you a review by the tech blogger ubertech ,
posted two days before your search engine drop .
&quot; margarita motions wasn &apos;t just plagiarized . it stinks . &quot;
don &apos;t you think your search engine drop
was due to the negative reviews ?
a drop isn &apos;t based on the quality of a product .
it &apos;s based on how many people link to it .
yes . but didn &apos;t , a week earlier , competing software ,
wicked savage designs , go on sale ?
and isn &apos;t it more popular ?
it is now .
isn &apos;t it at the top of all voice @-@ recognition searches ?
yes , but wicked savage also took out chumhum ads .
what ?
i said , wicked savage also took out chumhum ads .
well , here we are again .
good to see you , mr. gross .
this is harassment , pure and simple .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve met our newest associate , cary agos .
well , some people create , others destroy .
yup , i &apos;ll write that down .
wait here , please . we &apos;ll be right back .
they got the whole team .
i &apos;ll go get julie and elizabeth ?
good . i want him to negotiate
while our clients are staring right at him .
uh , hello ?
is that him ? !
is that the bastard ?
how many drinks does it take ? !
how many ? !
you rented out our conference room ?
in my capacity as trustee ,
supervising the restructuring of lockhart @-@ gardner ,
and taking upon myself the task
of seeking other cash @-@ flow opportunities ...
mr. hayden , we need our conference room .
it &apos;s for three days .
they &apos;re paying $ 8,765 .
we &apos;re in the middle of a million @-@ dollar negotiation .
where do you want me to do it-- in the bathroom ?
out of respect for his fellow alums ,
and without admitting fault ...
you bitch !
you stupid bitch !
um ... mr. gross is offering $ 123,000
to help defray julie and elizabeth &apos;s initial start @-@ up costs .
it &apos;s odd , you &apos;re not smiling .
usually when people joke , they smile .
you turn this down , ladies ,
and you &apos;ll see what deep pockets can do .
why don &apos;t you refrain from speaking to our clients , mr. gross ?
why don &apos;t you tell them the truth--
that you have no leverage here .
leverage belongs to whomever can outlast .
and money outlasts .
we take this money , we can start over .
it doesn &apos;t even begin to address what we lost .
he won &apos;t pay more . you heard him .
we have no leverage here .
julie , give us a day .
if we don &apos;t have leverage by then , take the offer .
you &apos;re the trustee , right ?
yes . and you are ... ?
oh , i &apos;m viola walsh .
i &apos;m the defendant in your current suit .
unfair trade practices .
may i help you ?
you may .
we &apos;re gonna fight this to the last breath .
your team is working on contingency .
and you don &apos;t fight waterloo on contingency .
now , i know that will gardner likes to battle with his ego ,
but i hope more dispassionate minds can rule .
ms. walsh , you have to negotiate with mr. gardner ,
not me .
you &apos;re watching out for the creditors , sir . will isn &apos;t .
and i don &apos;t think the creditors are going to be happy
when you throw good work after bad .
i &apos;m offering cash .
how much ?
and that &apos;s how a search works .
our software is like a gopher , but a really fast gopher .
it races through an index of billions of billions of web pages
all connected in a web of links .
we call this gopher chummie .
after chummie finds all the pages connected to your search ...
may i interrupt here ?
yes , your honor , of course .
is it ... is it loud enough ?
is this necessary ?
isn &apos;t it just trying to explain
a template @-@ based link analysis algorithm ?
uh , yes , your honor .
okay . then we can turn it off .
there &apos;s no jury . just me .
of course , your honor . my apologies .
so there &apos;s no link between ad sales and search engine results ?
that is correct .
even if i wanted to impact the results , i couldn &apos;t .
the algorithm acts on its own .
we don &apos;t touch it .
thank you , mr. gross .
why are you shaking your head , mr. gross ?
i don &apos;t know . the usual reasons .
disbelief , incredulity , disappointment .
i must be endangering the future .
no , just being a bit melodramatic .
so you never tweak the algorithm ?
chummie , the squirrel , just acts on his own ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that .
but you said you couldn &apos;t impact the results .
yes . but the algorithm needs almost daily attention and revision .
i see . and why would you revise it ?
well , for one thing , to avoid spam .
spammers are constantly trying to game the search results .
we adapt the algorithm to avoid that .
ah , so the quality of the web page
is taken into account in the algorithm ?
well , uh , uh , those are your words , but yes .
and that quality is determined on an almost @-@ daily basis ?
you said , &quot; tweak the algorithm daily . &quot;
yes .
did you tweak the algorithm on june 13 , 2011 ?
i have no idea .
but you said &quot; almost daily , &quot; so probably ?
i have no idea .
you have no idea whether the algorithm
was tweaked on june 13 , 2011,
the day our clients &apos; software dropped
from page one on your search engine results to page 28 ?
that is correct .
then , your honor , we subpoena chumhum for records on their algorithm .
your honor , excuse me . no .
the algorithm is the key to chumhum &apos;s success .
it &apos;s their secret sauce .
if you expose the algorithm , you expose a trade secret .
so ? the defendant has admitted to
changing the algorithm based on quality ,
which is the exact subject of this suit .
your honor , i just ...
and the only way to determine whether the defendant &apos;s claims are true
is to subpoena the evidence .
the best evidence rule applies here , your honor .
your honor , the plaintiff knows that
we will never reveal the algorithm .
he is just using the court authority
so that he can force us into a settlement .
the difficulty i see , ms. walsh ,
is that an attribute @-@ based linked analysis
is not a closed system .
therefore , it is subject to manipulation .
so i am prone to order such a subpoena .
we ask for 24 hours to prepare our arguments .
sorry , i couldn &apos;t hear that .
we ask for 24 hours to prepare .
remember when i used to sleep on your couch ?
eli . what are you doing here ?
oh , i &apos;m missing a speech to the national council of la raza .
how about you ?
working .
do you mind closing the door ?
what do you need , eli ?
we &apos;ve never talked about this .
in fact , i &apos;ve deliberately avoided talking about it .
by &quot; it , &quot; you mean ... ?
you and will .
just so you know , i &apos;d rather be doing anything else .
okay .
mandy post , the reporter ,
wants to talk to you about your ... affair .
her word .
i pushed mandy .
she seems to have a copy of a hotel receipt
for a september 30 , 2011 ...
encounter ...
and i need to know if that timing makes sense .
i don &apos;t know .
there is a chance this all could be a bluff .
but do you have any way of checking if you were ...
if there was a hotel stay ?
is she going to press with this ?
she hopes to .
and i hope to stop her .
can you ?
i don &apos;t know .
she likes to think of herself as a responsible journalist .
the good news is , responsible journalists are the easiest to co @-@ opt .
are you still seeing him ?
let me put it this way :
if you are still seeing ...
will ...
you need to stop ,
for a time .
this magazine has been known to follow people .
i &apos;m not seeing him .
good .
can i ask you when this stopped ?
no .
yeah ?
it &apos;s me .
where are you ? don &apos;t you come to work anymore ?
what do you need , eli ?
your help . and first of all ,
let me say it &apos;s not what you think--
it &apos;s only tangentially about the campaign .
i &apos;m not helping peter .
it &apos;s not about--
who &apos;s peter ?
someone .
you have a lot of someones in your life .
yeah .
i want one of your omelets .
hey , bill wants to come over
to say hi .
you know , he doesn &apos;t blame you anymore .
he &apos;s getting the cast off , and ...
i was just thinking that ...
right .
so that &apos;s how we &apos;re gonna play it , is it ?
how &apos;s that ?
yeah , that &apos;s better .
you know , you have a strange idea ...
of how things work now .
i &apos;m the husband
and you &apos;re the wife .
yeah .
and this isn &apos;t your home anymore .
clean it up .
thomas giles .
i work as a search engine optimizer .
and what is that ?
ms. walsh , i know what a search engine optimizer is .
thank you , your honor . of course .
when you offer your services , mr. giles ,
what is it that you guarantee ?
to get my clients onto
the first page of a chumhum search engine result .
i see . and did the plaintiffs hire you to do ...
objection , your honor . relevance .
this is a preliminary hearing to discuss
the subpoena of chumhum &apos;s algorithm .
yes , but the question of damages must be established
before the question of a subpoena .
how many witnesses do you intend ?
to establish the absence of damages ? two .
i will allow .
and did the plaintiffs hire you
to get their product on the first page of a chumhum search ?
yes .
in other words , the plaintiffs hired you
to &quot; game &quot; the system .
objection !
and the chumhum algorithm just countered that gaming ...
objection .
overruled .
thank you , your honor .
miss holmes , where do you work ?
in chumhum &apos;s advertising department .
you &apos;re the evil advertiser who approached the plaintiffs
about an online ad ?
well , i hope not evil , but yes .
and they turned you down .
yes .
unfortunately , it happens .
so you immediately told mr. gross ,
so that he could meddle with the algorithm and get back at them ?
no .
you didn &apos;t ? really ?
because that just seems like the sensible next step .
objection .
withdrawn .
what did you do next , miss holmes ?
well , after they said no , i went on vacation .
you did ? for how long ?
two weeks .
and did you tell anyone at chumhum about the plaintiff &apos;s ad rejection ?
before vacation ? no .
it was bad news .
i usually hold off on bad news .
so , just so i &apos;m clear ,
you never told anyone ...
i get it , ms. walsh .
any change in the algorithm
couldn &apos;t have come from the advertising department
because miss holmes was on vacation .
do you have any documentation to that effect ?
of course , your honor .
you &apos;re on it ?
yeah . how long have i got ?
we &apos;re back in court tomorrow .
there &apos;s got to be someone
this advertising rep told before her vacation .
we got this ?
were we together on september 30 last year ?
together ?
i don &apos;t know . why ?
at a hotel ?
maybe . i don &apos;t know .
but you paid . i don &apos;t remember ,
was it that hotel downtown , the fairmont ?
i can look .
thanks .
mandy post says she has a copy of the receipt .
i don &apos;t see how she could .
well , eli needs something to ...
refute her .
she &apos;s gonna print it ?
eli &apos;s having a meeting with her tonight to convince her not to .
i &apos;ll look right away .
you okay ?
i don &apos;t know .
i feel cursed .
will ...
i like you ,
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m giving you a chance to save face .
we &apos;re upping our offer 20 % .
you want a divorce ? !
you got it !
we want this over .
we &apos;re offering $ 160,000 .
will , i know that your ego is invested in this ,
but i hope that more dispassionate minds rule .
oh , no , what do you have for us now ?
you were right-- it wasn &apos;t about the advertising ;
that &apos;s not why you messed with the algorithm .
then why are we still talking ?
you messed with the algorithm because mr. gross secretly
bought out wicked savage designs .
he bought the top competing voice @-@ recognition software ,
and a week later , margarita dropped on his search engine ,
and wicked savage climbed .
we &apos;re presenting it in court tomorrow
unless you come up with a real offer .
well , that was satisfying .
sometimes the stars align .
what are you doing ?
talking to viola .
ms. walsh ? yes .
we &apos;re in negotiations with her !
calm down , ms. lockhart .
no .
you don &apos;t sabotage will .
how am i sabotaging ?
by talking to her .
is she saying will is a problematic negotiator
and you need to step in ?
is she lowballing you ?
yes , of course she is !
i &apos;ll go to the judge--
i will get you replaced for sabotaging our negotiations , i swear !
i am helping you !
of course she &apos;s lowballing me .
i &apos;m not dumb . i &apos;m getting her offer up .
why do you think she added 20 % ?
she thinks she &apos;s pulling me on to her side .
but she &apos;s not ?
ms. lockhart ...
i work for the firm .
yes , i have the power to veto you and mr. gardner ,
but your success ...
is my success .
you have been paranoid for so long ,
you don &apos;t recognize when someone is on your side .
no . actually , i &apos;m waiting for a call .
i &apos;m just gonna call about homework .
eli is calling this number , and i don &apos;t want to miss it .
i &apos;ll get the call waiting .
grace , i said no . in ten minutes .
hello ?
alicia ?
yeah . eli ?
can you talk ?
yeah .
i &apos;m here with mandy , talking over the story .
yeah .
you &apos;re in the clear .
how ? she got the date wrong ?
no .
it &apos;s , uh ...
i @-@ it &apos;s not about you .
don &apos;t worry .
eli , thank you . i ...
thank you .
okay , i gotta go .
take care .
is everything all right ?
yeah .
can i have the phone now ?
&quot; may i have the phone now ? &quot;
may i ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
you all right ?
yeah .
oh , actually , i do need the phone , just for one minute .
now ?
yeah , i left my cell phone at work .
alicia , hi .
how are you ?
okay .
we &apos;re okay .
you talked to eli ?
just now .
it wasn &apos;t about us .
good . who &apos;s it about ?
um ... i &apos;ve gotta go .
yeah . thanks for calling , alicia .
you &apos;re welcome .
you &apos;ve reached the voice mail of eli gold .
zach , grace , i &apos;m going to go out for a few minutes .
alicia , hey .
everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know , eli , is it ?
mandy .
you said it wasn &apos;t about us , so who &apos;s it about ?
alicia .
eli , it &apos;s going to come out anyway .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s a lie , it &apos;s gossip ,
the same as when we thought it was you and will .
i &apos;m gonna make this easy .
there &apos;s a rumor of peter sleeping with someone last year .
mandy has a hotel receipt ?
we were separated , eli .
just tell me .
i &apos;m just getting to the bottom of this now .
and i haven &apos;t told peter .
supposedly it &apos;s a campaign worker ,
but it &apos;s pure fiction .
alicia ...
this is politics .
peter is vulnerable in this ,
and that is why it &apos;s being used .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
i have to go .
you know , you did call me .
i know .
tomorrow night ?
sorry to inconvenience you .
lana , i really have to go .
kalinda , you come here ,
and i feel like i &apos;m warming you up for someone else .
you &apos;re not .
you seem good .
i &apos;m excited about the case .
uh , your honor , before we begin ,
i believe there &apos;s still a question of standing .
no , your honor , there &apos;s no question of standing .
there is a question of chumhum &apos;s purchase of wicked savage .
yes , but first there is a question of standing
being raised by chancellor carlyle .
who ?
your honor , i am the chancellor of chicago polytechnic .
i &apos;m happy for you .
now , what do you want ?
i &apos;m here to assert the university &apos;s ownership
of the software titled margarita motions .
what ? !
if i could point to page 42 of the university &apos;s student handbook :
&quot; the college owns the right
&quot; to all works , inventions , developments , and discoveries
created by employees or students ... &quot;
you &apos;re kidding-- we invented this .
yes , but on school property and using school resources .
there is a legal precedent here , your honor .
google was forced to negotiate with stanford
over the rights to google ,
and the university of illinois
sued one of the cofounders of netscape for trademark infringement .
therefore , we ask that the subpoena be quashed ,
given that the plaintiffs &apos; standing here is unclear .
just give me a listen .
uh , i &apos;m on a case , eli .
it &apos;s for alicia , not peter .
look , peter is being accused of sleeping
with a campaign worker , and he didn &apos;t .
i &apos;m just trying to stop the story
before it embarrasses alicia .
embarrasses alicia ?
yes .
after all she &apos;s been through , you know it will .
just listen to the reporter &apos;s questions , that &apos;s all .
this is kalinda , my assistant . i asked her to sit in .
hi .
really ?
i thought we were finishing up .
oh , no , i &apos;m sorry if i gave you that impression .
if you want face time with peter and alicia ,
i &apos;ll need to know what you &apos;re going to ask .
his assistant , huh ?
peter florrick and one of his campaign workers
slept together on september 30 .
where ?
eli , we vetted this .
then what &apos;s your worry ?
the st. martin .
was she visiting him or he visiting her ?
they were both there .
campaign workers on one floor , peter on another .
and which room did they go to ?
they had a prearranged signal .
she was to go to his floor at 11 : 30 and knock on his door .
on how many occasions ?
what &apos;s her name ?
no .
mandy , if it &apos;s true ...
and if i tell you , you &apos;ll have no reason to buy the magazine .
get me face time .
eli told me .
peter , let &apos;s not do this , please .
it &apos;s not true ; i wanted you to know .
seriously , peter , i have had a very long day ,
and by the end of the week ,
i will have had a very long week .
look , i have a target on my back , and this is not true .
do you remember what you said the first time ?
&quot; it &apos;s not true . &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly why they &apos;re throwing this crap at me--
because my denials will look like lies .
it &apos;s politics .
the problem is , peter , i don &apos;t give a damn .
good morning , chancellor .
what &apos;s this , chancellor ?
it &apos;s my book-- a book i wrote about
ways to improve education in america .
and what income did you derive from this book ?
in royalties ?
i ... well , i don &apos;t have the facts and figures at my fingertips .
i do , actually .
$ 71,450 , mostly due to students
being required to buy it as a textbook .
now , how much of that money went to the college ?
how much ? you mean , of the royalties ?
i don &apos;t know .
did any portion go to the college ?
i ... no .
but you &apos;re a college employee , aren &apos;t you , sir ?
and the student handbook here clearly states ,
&quot; college owns the rights to all works ,
&quot; inventions , developments , and discoveries
created by employees and students . &quot;
yes , but that &apos;s not a fair comparison .
i &apos;m the university chancellor .
so the rules don &apos;t apply to you ?
no , that &apos;s not what i said .
the college is selective in how it enforces its rules ?
oh , come on .
there is a radical difference between $ 71,000
in royalties and the potential millions
from the plaintiffs &apos; voice recognition software .
yes , thank you for prompting the good chancellor
in how to answer my question , but ...
objection , your honor .
i find this line of question offensive and irrelevant .
no , it isn &apos;t , ms. walsh ; it actually isn &apos;t .
please continue , counselor .
thank you , your honor .
is mr. neil gross a graduate of your university ?
he is an honored graduate .
and did you know that his company chumhum
is worth $ 86 billion ?
well , even if you didn &apos;t know that , you knew
that he &apos;d given a $ 50 million endowment to the university .
yes .
so ... have you claimed ownership of chumhum ?
no .
really ?
but you read in his book that he created
his page @-@ ranking hierarchy in your computer lab .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m ready to rule on standing .
it is my determination that , due to estoppel by silence
and my general disgust with the chancellor &apos;s tactics ...
excuse me , sir .
excuse me . this is my court ;
you may go now . thank you .
the college has no standing here ,
and the interests of the plaintiff &apos;s suit holds sway .
yes ! yes !
i also find that
mr. gross will open all pertinent aspects
of his algorithm to scrutiny ...
your honor , we cannot allow the algorithm ,
as you know ...
yes , you can .
ms. walsh , what you cannot do is hide behind
the skirts of trade secrets indefinitely .
i will appoint a third party
to peruse all algorithm documents ,
in order to avoid competitive leaking .
mr. gardner ?
yes .
i know what you &apos;re doing .
your firm &apos;s bankrupt .
you lost my competitor , patric edelstein ,
so you &apos;re looking for another big fish .
you know i have a tendency to buy out my irritants ,
hire firms who sue me ,
so this-- just a little performance piece .
well , not to toot our own horn , mr. gross ,
but there is strategic advantage in hiring the firm
that used to represent your competition .
although we &apos;re legally bound by attorney @-@ client privilege ,
we know how mr. edelstein works
and we know how to beat him .
you &apos;re right-- strategically smart--
but , you see , here &apos;s the thing :
i don &apos;t like you
and i intend to go out of my way to never hire you .
nice talking with you .
look , mr. gross ,
little advice :
if you &apos;re looking for a good lawyer ,
don &apos;t go with who you like .
if i can irritate you like this ,
just think what i can do to your enemies .
i &apos;m rich enough not to care .
there were 12 campaign workers at the st. martin ,
ten of them female .
who &apos;s that ?
indira starr , advance .
and she was at the hotel ?
yeah , why ?
kalinda , it is not true .
peter did not sleep with her .
eli ...
i want you to look at this speech ...
hi , peter .
peter , you know kalinda sharma ?
yes , in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
of course , yeah . she &apos;s helping us with , uh , mandy post .
excuse me .
uh , you want the photo ?
i &apos;m sorry .
thanks .
sure .
you have her on this ?
yeah , why ?
she wants to be on it ?
yeah .
okay . okay .
what do i need to know here , peter ?
nothing .
let &apos;s go over this .
you &apos;re reluctant to reveal the chumhum algorithm to the court .
why is that ?
well , for the obvious reason ,
it &apos;s our crown jewels .
other companies would pay millions for access to it .
and you &apos;re here to tell the court that
you won &apos;t acquiesce to their subpoena , is that right ?
yes , but i believe i have the law on my side .
why is that ?
the first amendment .
oh , dear god .
mr. gardner . please .
our search engine results are protected by free speech .
to compel their release is the same as
compelling a newspaper to reveal its sources .
thank you , your honor .
therefore , you have editorial discretion , mr. gross ?
yes , and that is why i am resisting this subpoena .
kalinda , hello .
hey .
this must be your friend .
kalinda is it ?
how are you doing ? i &apos;m nick .
he was just keeping me company . thrilling me with his accent .
oh , i was trying to .
so how do you two know each other ?
just friends .
really ?
you seem like more .
well , i don &apos;t know . you seem like , uh ,
adopted sisters or something .
no .
friends from way back .
let me get you both a drink .
friends .
sure .
oh , i &apos;ve just got something through .
sorry . will you excuse me , please ?
i &apos;m just gonna be one second .
dyke .
kevin costas .
i &apos;m a blogger .
my blog , ubertech , was awarded
one of the top 25 tech blogs of 2010 by engadget .
congratulations . and on your blog you wrote :
&quot; margarita motions wasn &apos;t just plagiarized ...
it stinks . &quot;
yes .
and how do you know it was plagiarized ?
how do i know the software was ?
because it was .
&apos;cause it &apos;s not very good .
and you have proof they stole it ?
you mean , actual proof ?
no .
but i don &apos;t need it . it &apos;s my opinion .
objection , your honor .
what does this have to do with the lawsuit ?
mr. gross is claiming
editorial discretion for his search engine ,
therefore he is responsible for its editorial content ...
wait a minute ...
they can &apos;t have their cake and eat it too , your honor .
if they insist on free speech protections ,
then they &apos;re responsible for that speech .
your honor ...
no , ms. walsh , she &apos;s right .
overruled .
so , mr. costas , you printed the accusation of plagiarism
without checking truth or falsehood ?
i didn &apos;t need to .
and did mr. gross , or anyone from chumhum
ask you for evidence as to the truth of your accusation ?
uh ... from chumhum ?
uh , no .
judge , this is absurd .
chumhum has millions of pages .
if my client is gonna be held liable for every single one ...
well , then there will be a hell of a lot of defamation suits .
yes , ms. walsh .
i &apos;m not making a free speech argument .
you are .
one million dollars .
but you have to take it now .
no consulting with will . no second guessing .
just business between two like minds .
no .
we &apos;re not going higher .
that &apos;s probably true .
it &apos;s one million dollars .
this firm is bankrupt .
then negotiate with will . tell him .
but i &apos;ll advise him not to take it .
why ?
i &apos;ve seen the evidence .
you &apos;re a businessman .
yes . show a businessman a winning hand ,
he doesn &apos;t need to be a gambler to go all in .
i &apos;m going all in .
will has gotten to you .
he &apos;s put dollar signs in your eyes .
i &apos;m trying to be the peacemaker here .
why aren &apos;t people just upfront with what they want ?
why don &apos;t they ever just say what they mean ?
well , you have chosen a really strange time to get philosophical .
no .
it &apos;s the perfect time .
thank you .
at first i was just ...
you know , flirtatious .
older guys like to flirt with me .
i have a nice laugh .
and then you two had sex ?
yeah , but it wasn &apos;t a big deal .
i told that reporter ,
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m some rielle hunter .
因与美国民主党前参议员约翰 · 爱德华兹有情史而著名
how many times did you have sex ?
maybe eight times . i don &apos;t know .
was it always at a hotel ?
no , uh , twice at his apartment .
once , we were doing it in the bedroom and
we heard his wife coming home .
yeah , it was like something out of a movie .
i had to hide in the bathroom .
she saw me , too .
she saw you ?
alicia saw you ?
yeah , alicia .
but she said it was no big deal .
i mean , she &apos;s used to it .
i guess he &apos;s a real man whore .
really ?
oh , yeah .
she was like , you can do it anywhere you want ,
just not in my apartment .
but you know how it is .
we are negotiating .
zero is not a negotiation .
well , then throw out some numbers .
mr. gross , settle down .
sorry we &apos;re late . where are we at ?
we seem to be at zero .
well , don &apos;t forget , we &apos;ve agreed not to sue for court costs .
stop playing games , viola .
it &apos;s settle or hand over the algorithm .
mm ... no .
i think there &apos;s a third way .
and what &apos;s that ?
have you spoken to your clients ?
you &apos;re right .
i do tend to buy out my irritants .
just not their lawyers .
oh , alicia , hi . we were just leaving a note .
you settled ?
mr. gross hired us to run wicked savage designs for him .
their voice recognition software .
what happened to running your own company ?
things change .
thank you , alicia .
you guys were great . if we ever get in trouble again ,
we will give a call .
what do you need , eli ?
eli ?
do you and peter have an open marriage ?
i &apos;ll take that as a no .
take it any way you want .
we interviewed the campaign worker
who supposedly slept with peter
and she said you have an open marriage .
well , i can &apos;t stop what peter says .
no . she said you told her .
she said you found her
in your apartment bathroom , hiding ,
and you told her not to worry about sleeping with peter
because you have an open marriage ...
just so long as it &apos;s not at your apartment .
this is all a lie ?
good .
then that means this campaign worker isn &apos;t just lying about peter .
she is also lying about you .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re getting on about this .
it isn &apos;t that hard .
i know you tried a lot of things
when i was away ,
and i forgive you .
thanks .
yep .
but now i &apos;m back .
and i don &apos;t want you doing anymore of that college dorm stuff .
no more ... no more women .
things change .
some things don &apos;t change .
you belong to me .
i belong to you .
and i know where your girlfriend lives .
i &apos;d like to see you try .
i don &apos;t think you would .
oh , i would .
she &apos;s a federal agent .
my girlfriend ...
is a federal agent .
so good luck with that .
oh , eli ,
are we , are we doing this speech in oak park ?
&apos;cause if we are ,
