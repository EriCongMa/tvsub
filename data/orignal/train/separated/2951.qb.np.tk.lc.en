you ready to go ?
let me just finish this .
hey , ross . check this out .
yeah , i can &apos;t do that .
what are you doing ?
have you seen this ?
it &apos;s our new alumni website for college .
you can post messages for people , let everyone know what you &apos;re up to .
oh , great . a faster way to tell people that i &apos;m unemployed and childless .
it &apos;s actually interesting to find out what people are doing .
remember andrea rich ?
that tall girl that wouldn &apos;t sleep with you ?
well , her internet company went under , and she lost an ear in a boating accident .
bet she &apos;d sleep with you now .
no , i already e @-@ mailed her .
let me see what you wrote about yourself .
&quot; doctor of paleontology , two kids . &quot;
wait a second . you split with carol because you had different interests ?
i think you split with carol because you had one very similar interest .
i &apos;m gonna finish this later , okay ? let me just grab my coat .
okay !
what , did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes ?
maybe we finish this for him .
also , i cloned a dinosaur in my lab .
she is now my girlfriend .
i don &apos;t care what society says , it &apos;s the best sex i &apos;ve ever had .
and send .
no , no .. you can &apos;t do that to him .
all right , let &apos;s go .
dude !
i think you made it clear you can &apos;t be trusted with the ball inside the house .
and send .
the.one.with.the.memorial.service
hey . how was basketball ?
it was fun . right up until chandler got a finger in the eye .
oh , no ! who did that ?
chandler . yeah .
hey !
rach ?
yeah ?
what &apos;s huggsy doing in the crib with emma ?
she was just crawling around and found him , so i just let her sleep with him .
that &apos;s all right , isn &apos;t it ?
of course . yeah .
it &apos;s a stuffed animal , you know ? it &apos;s for kids . not for adults .
i know that .
joey , you &apos;re sure ? i mean , i know how much you love him .
rachel , let &apos;s be clear on this , okay ?
i do not love huggsy .
i like him a normal amount .
all right . well , emma loves him .
yeah . well , why wouldn &apos;t she ? he &apos;s a wonderful person !
hi .
hey , phoebe . how you doing ?
you feeling better ?
breaking up sucks .
oh , i really miss mike .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;ve tried everything to feel better .
i even tried writing a song about it ..
but i can &apos;t think of anything that rhymes with :
oh , i so know how you feel .
breaking up with richard was the hardest thing i &apos;ve ever done in my life .
all right , fine , i &apos;ll put another dollar in the richard jar .
hey , monica , i &apos;m gonna need your help getting through this .
you &apos;re saying you &apos;re not gonna need my help ?
no . when i get to the point where i &apos;m ready ..
to hear cruel , mocking jokes about mike , i &apos;m gonna come to you .
oh , good , because i &apos;ve already thought of three . four ! i just thought of a fourth !
okay . i mean , i know i did the right thing .
mike never wants to get married ..
and i shouldn &apos;t be in a relationship that has no future .
but pretty soon , i &apos;m gonna miss him so much ..
i &apos;m gonna want to see him again , and you have to stop me .
okay , you got it .
unless .. am i being too crazy about this ?
all right , so there &apos;s no future . but that doesn &apos;t mean we still can &apos;t have fun .
you know what ? forget what i said .
really ?
all right , if that &apos;s what you want .
that was a test , and you just failed .
damn it ! rookie mistake !
i have sex with dinosaurs ?
i believe i read that somewhere .
not only is it not funny , it &apos;s physically impossible ! okay ?
depending on the species , i &apos;d have to have a 6 @-@ foot @-@ long .. it &apos;s not funny !
i respectfully disagree .
i can &apos;t believe you put that on my alumni page .
who cares ? nobody reads those .
you better hope not ..
because i just read what you put on your page .
i don &apos;t have a page .
oh , i respectfully disagree !
huggsy ?
huggsy ?
huggsy .
i want my penguin .
look at you . all sweet and innocent , sleeping like an angel .
with emma &apos;s chubby little hands wrapped around you .
it &apos;s okay , emma . you stay asleep .
step away from the crib ! i have a weapon !
it &apos;s okay ! it &apos;s okay , rach ! it &apos;s me ! put down the scrunchie .
what are you doing ?
well , i heard emma stirring ..
so i came in to make sure she could reach huggsy .
oh , thanks . all right , well , now that i &apos;m up , i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
okay , there you go , sweetie .
this isn &apos;t over !
wait a second . why would ross tell everyone in your class ..
that you are &quot; as gay as the day is long &quot; ?
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs .
well , that &apos;s clearly a joke . this could easily be true .
would you get that , please ? people have been calling to congratulate me all day .
hello ?
no , he &apos;s not here . yeah , this is his wife .
yeah . well , it came as quite a shock to me too !
well , i guess i should &apos;ve known . he just kept making me watch moulin rouge .
hang up ! hang up !
and that was a great movie .
i &apos;m so gonna get back at ross .
oh , yeah , this &apos;ll show him . here we go .
what are you doing ?
oh , you &apos;ll see , my friend !
i &apos;m dead ?
and so young .
posting that i died ? that really isn &apos;t funny .
well , how you died was funny .
oh , please . hit by a blimp ?
it kills over one americans every year .
unbelievable . my classmates are gonna think i &apos;m dead .
my professors . my parents are gonna get phone calls !
you &apos;re messing with people &apos;s feelings here .
you wanna talk about people &apos;s feelings ? you should have heard how hurt ..
professor stern was when i told him i wouldn &apos;t be able to go to key west !
you &apos;ve really crossed a line here . but that &apos;s okay .
because i &apos;m on my way to buy some photoshop software ..
and a stack of gay porn .
that &apos;s right . your coming @-@ out is about to get real graphic !
god , i wish mike were here .
okay , if mike were here , what would the two of you be doing ?
what are you , animals ? it &apos;s 4 : 00 in the afternoon .
i gotta call him . just to talk to him . there &apos;s no harm in that .
that &apos;s how it starts . &quot; i don &apos;t need to eat the cake , i &apos;ll just smell the icing .
why not just a little sliver ? &quot; or , &quot; okay , just a slice or two . &quot;
the next thing you know , you &apos;re 210 pounds ..
and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide !
that &apos;s not true , is it ?
they had to cut me out ..
with the jaws of life .
phoebe , honey , i know this is hard .
but look , if you talk to him , then you &apos;re gonna want to see him .
and if you see him , you &apos;re gonna wanna get back together .
and i know that &apos;s not what you want .
all right , so give me your phone .
here .
and now your cell .
okay .
there you go .
this is your cell phone ?
yes .
this is your current cell phone ?
yes . it reminds me of a simpler time .
phoebe ? where &apos;s your purse ?
hey ! no !
no !
give it to me !
you can &apos;t have it !
give it to me !
no !
i &apos;ll go in there !
oh , yeah .
phoebe , come here !
no !
give it to me !
you &apos;re crazy !
damn you , monica geller hyphen bing !
don &apos;t even think of sneaking out and using a pay phone ..
because i am everywhere , baby !
hey , look who &apos;s here . it &apos;s joey . and he brought home a friend .
emma &apos;s right here . you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day !
no , no , no , it &apos;s not a girl . it &apos;s ..
a brand @-@ new huggsy !
oh ! oh , that &apos;s so great ! now emma has two huggsies !
no , no . oh , no . no , emma has one huggsy .
the new huggsy .
the other huggsy , i don &apos;t know , i guess i &apos;ll just take him back .
you know what ? when i was a little girl , i had a little pink pony named cotton .
oh , i loved her so much . i took her everywhere . i would braid her tail ..
make the transfer !
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old huggsy and i can &apos;t find it ?
no , don &apos;t worry about it . i swallowed that years ago . hey !
oh , what ? i don &apos;t think she likes the new huggsy .
but he &apos;s the same .
i think she wants the old one back .
yeah , but he &apos;s the same .
joey , come on .
but he &apos;s the same !
you &apos;re not the same .
you know , it &apos;s a lot less surprising to do that ..
after i &apos;ve buzzed you into the building .
so , phoebe , why are there men &apos;s shoes by the door ?
those are my shoes .
well , when you get over this breakup , we need to go shopping .
look , monica , i really appreciate you checking in on me .
but i &apos;m actually feeling a lot better .
you are ?
yeah , i just kind of want to be alone right now .
who &apos;s that ?
i ordered chinese food .
what are the chances ? !
one billion chinese people , and they send mike !
what are you doing here ?
phoebe called me .
phoebe !
i &apos;m sorry . i broke down .
i wanted to see him .
well , not on my watch .
damn it , phoebe , how did you even call him ?
there &apos;s a speakerphone on the base unit .
base unit . think , monica , think !
can i come in ?
no ! no .
phoebe , isn &apos;t seeing mike exactly what you wanted me to stop you from doing ?
look , if i want to see phoebe , and she ..
this doesn &apos;t concern you !
sorry . i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name .
look , guys , you can &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s gonna make getting over each other harder .
not if nothing happens . why can &apos;t we just hang out as friends ?
sure . if you &apos;re just gonna hang out as friends , then maybe i &apos;ll join you .
you know , i &apos;m your friend and mike &apos;s friend .
sit down .
make room for your friend .
so how have you been ?
i &apos;ve been pretty good .
you look really beautiful .
thanks . you look good too .
no , no , no . this is dangerous territory . keep it clean .
so how &apos;s the piano playing going ?
actually , i &apos;ve been playing a lot of love songs lately .
i &apos;ve missed you .
i &apos;ve missed you too .
you know , on the way over here , i saw this drunk guy throw up .
and then a pigeon ate it .
hey . ross .
look , i just wanted to apologize .
don &apos;t tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me .
check this out .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;d look like if i worked out .
and was being serviced by a policeman .
you &apos;re not gonna actually send these out , are you ?
actually , i don &apos;t need to , because your little &quot; ross is dead &quot; joke didn &apos;t work .
okay ? there were no responses .
nobody posted anything , nobody called my parents , so the joke is on you .
nobody called , nobody wrote anything , nobody cares that i &apos;m dead .
oh , my god .
nobody cares that i &apos;m dead ?
oh , come on , you know that &apos;s not true .
what are you talking about ? you get 60 responses ..
just for coming out of the closet .
i didn &apos;t get one response , and i &apos;m dead !
well , the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .
i can &apos;t believe this . not even my geology lab partner . and i carried that guy !
look , let &apos;s think about this , okay ?
you think people are gonna disturb your family at this tragic time ?
that people are gonna post condolences on a website ?
this isn &apos;t about people not caring .
this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .
you &apos;re right . there isn &apos;t a decent outlet .
right .
i &apos;m sure if you had a funeral or memorial service , tons of people would come .
exactly !
ross , what are you doing ?
you &apos;re having a memorial service for yourself ?
no , that would be stupid . you &apos;re having it for me .
ross , don &apos;t press send . don &apos;t press ..
no , too late . too late . it &apos;s sent .
sorry , so is that picture of you and the policeman .
that &apos;s all right . i &apos;m tan , limber ..
and it looks like i talked my way out of that ticket .
the surgery was not a success . and then you say :
&quot; what are we gonna do , drake ? &quot;
come in .
i &apos;m trying to put emma down for a nap . have you seen huggsy ?
original or crappy ?
original .
no . sorry . haven &apos;t seen him .
then what &apos;s that big lump under your covers ?
it &apos;s monica , okay ?
that &apos;s not monica !
all right , fine ! it &apos;s original huggsy !
i know emma wants him , but he &apos;s mine and i need him .
she &apos;s being unreasonable .
joey , there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much !
oh , don &apos;t cover its ears !
it &apos;s because it reminds her of her uncle joey .
it does ?
yeah .
and i think she really likes him because he smells like you .
and she .. she loves that .
go figure .
and she &apos;s comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .
really ? she loves me ?
oh , yeah .
but you know what ? if you need huggsy , don &apos;t worry .
emma will totally understand . i won &apos;t , but whatever .
okay , wait a minute , rach . i mean , if ..
if huggsy means that much to emma , then ..
well , she can have him .
oh , sweet , i knew uncle joey would step up .
look , emma . look who &apos;s back .
no , forget it ! forget it ! i can &apos;t do it !
are you .. ? you &apos;re gonna take huggsy away from a little child ?
how do you think i got him in the first place ?
and then it just gobbled up that puke . i mean ..
that was one gross pigeon .
oh , man . why didn &apos;t i ask joey to keep us apart ?
you throw a meatball in the hallway , we &apos;d be doing it like rabbits right now .
all right , you two . i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
i don &apos;t want anything going on while i &apos;m gone .
here &apos;s a few things you can discuss :
mucus , fungus , and the idea of me and ross doing it .
i &apos;ve missed you so much .
i won &apos;t ask you to get back together . i know we want different things , but ..
just to be with you one more night .
i want that too .
but is that gonna make it too hard ?
it can &apos;t be any harder than this .
i mean , if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time , i ..
i would have stopped to memorize your face , the way you moved .
everything about you .
if i had known the last time i kissed you would be the last time ..
i never would have stopped .
kiss him , you fool !
what ?
didn &apos;t you hear that speech ?
if you don &apos;t kiss him , then i will .
i missed you so much .
i knew you &apos;d be here !
crap .
who is this ?
my friend manny .
i asked him to keep me away from you .
hey , that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing for phoebe .
well , you &apos;re not doing a very good job .
excuse me ?
what &apos;s with the kissing ?
hey , at least i knew where my guy was .
yeah , thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing .
you didn &apos;t hear the speech .
i &apos;ve heard the speech .
if he knew it was gonna be the last time ..
hey , it was very moving . you &apos;re just heartless !
you &apos;re weak !
you &apos;re weird !
your pants are undone .
where &apos;d they go ?
damn it .
well , we blew it .
i blame myself .
and i blame you too .
it &apos;s been an hour , and not one of my classmates has shown up ?
i tell you , when i actually die , some people are gonna get seriously haunted .
there you go . someone came .
okay . okay . i &apos;m gonna go hide .
this is so exciting . my first mourner !
hi . glad you could come .
please come in .
hi . you &apos;re chandler bing , right ?
i &apos;m tom gordon . i was in your class .
oh , yes . yes , let me take your coat .
thanks . i &apos;m so sorry about ross , it &apos;s ..
no , at least he died doing what he loved .
watching blimps .
who is it ?
you know some guy , tom gordon ?
i don &apos;t remember him .
but then again , i touched so many lives .
so did you know ross well ?
actually , i barely knew him . i came because i heard chandler &apos;s news .
do you know if he &apos;s seeing anyone ?
yes , he is . me .
what ? you mean .. ?
can i ask you a personal question ? how do you shave your beard so close ?
okay , tommy ! that &apos;s enough mourning for you .
here we go bye @-@ bye . all right .
hey , listen . call me .
okay .
i &apos;m dead and no one cares ?
i look like a man ?
please , one ridiculous problem at a time .
this isn &apos;t ridiculous . look around , no one &apos;s here .
you gave them one day &apos;s notice . not everyone checks the website every day .
and monica , it &apos;s probably the way you stand !
i guess you &apos;re right . still , somebody must have seen it .
i went to that school for four years and i didn &apos;t have an impact on anyone ?
well , that &apos;s not true . you had an impact on me .
i mean , it &apos;s 15 years later and we &apos;re still best friends .
doesn &apos;t that count for something ?
oh , great , more party boys for chandler .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s somebody for you . now go hide .
hi . i &apos;m here for ross geller &apos;s memorial service .
kori ? kori weston ?
yeah .
you look amazing .
and you are ?
chandler . chandler bing . and i &apos;m not gay . i &apos;m not gay at all .
you are married , though .
don &apos;t listen to him . he &apos;s in a really bad mood .
i can &apos;t believe that ross is gone . it is just so sad .
i didn &apos;t know ross and you were so close .
oh , we weren &apos;t . but we had one class together . he was such a great guy .
and he talked so passionately about science .
i always remembered him .
i &apos;m sure that would mean a lot to him .
and if heaven has a door ..
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out .
i guess i really missed my chance .
no , you didn &apos;t !
i &apos;m still alive !
who did we bury ?
kori , i know this is a big surprise for you .
it &apos;s a long story . but the things you just said really made my day .
the fact that you &apos;re here means more to me ..
than if this room were filled with people .
you sick freak ! who does that ?
i can &apos;t believe i had a crush on you .
did you hear that ?
kori weston had a crush on me !
no , mom , i am not dead .
i know it &apos;s not something to kid about .
it was just a practical joke between chandler and me , but it &apos;s over , okay ?
actually , no . even if i had died , you would not be left childless .
