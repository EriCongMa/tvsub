for good behavior .
oh . too bad he can &apos;t behave unless he &apos;s behind bars .
don &apos;t say that about your brother .
he made a mistake . he served his time .
everybody makes mistakes , jane .
running a priest down in a crosswalk
on your third d.u.i. conviction
is not a &quot; mistake . &quot;
father crowley has forgiven him .
why can &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re throwing him a party in a bar .
mom , are you crazy ?
technically , we &apos;re a bar and grill .
and we &apos;re only serving soda pop .
i thought that was just till the cake .
murray .
what makes you think he &apos;s gonna make it out here ?
easy , jane . take it easy .
she &apos;s right . you have to have a plan .
he comes back . he works for me .
oh , and he sleeps in his bunk bed
and plays with his toy soldiers .
yeah , that ought to straighten him right out , pop .
that &apos;s my son , and it &apos;s your brother .
look , if you and frankie don &apos;t want to come , don &apos;t .
fine . not coming .
me either .
you &apos;re gonna turn your back on this family ?
come on , ma .
ma . ma , we &apos;re both cops .
you can &apos;t expect us to do this .
rizzoli .
what ?
what ?
oh , no .
okay .
what happened ?
we got a cop shot .
danny clark , drug control unit .
he was in my class at the academy .
wife , two kids .
knew his father .
i knew danny since he was this tall .
it &apos;s a damn shame .
one shot to the head .
looks like a large @-@ caliber firearm .
it &apos;s a 45 @-@ caliber .
abrasions on his sternum .
and some hair &apos;s missing .
there &apos;s a piece of tape . hey , joe .
uh , photograph this , mark it , and bag it , okay ?
he was wearing a wire .
he was working for us .
homicide ?
yeah .
since when ?
i sent him under to get information
about the two dead truckers from charlestown you were working .
my case ? without telling me ?
it &apos;s my decision .
everyone fall in over here .
what the hell ?
let &apos;s go .
i want every cop and detective
down here working the streets on this .
get everyone from headquarters .
the only cop i want there is manning the front desk
until further notice .
you . you !
if you &apos;d kept us together on this ,
danny wouldn &apos;t be dead .
come on , easy , easy .
he wouldn &apos;t be dead !
you better have a good reason for sending him in alone .
a good reason .
bobby .
look , i need you , rizzoli .
yes , sir .
i want you to interview bobby .
he may not even know what he knows .
now , you &apos;re the best at this .
take him to headquarters .
i @-@ i can interview him here .
no , no , no , no . get him out of here .
yes , sir .
i know . i know .
jane .
yeah ?
that &apos;s the only thing i found in his pockets .
i &apos;ll , uh -- i &apos;ll bag it and get it to evidence .
frankie , you want to ... ?
hey , man , come on , come on . let &apos;s -- let &apos;s go .
okay ?
ugh ! what a sunday .
what ? no , no , no . no , no , no .
$ 20 &apos;s , uh , overkill .
you &apos;re only a jerk if you don &apos;t leave anything . here .
god , when was that made ? november ?
marino wants a cup of coffee . there &apos;s none upstairs .
guy &apos;s a wreck .
i &apos;ve tried everything --
british strawberries , fennel , bok choy .
are -- are we in the same conversation ?
sorry . i @-@ i was talking about bass .
oh . you &apos;re obsessing over your turtle again ?
tortoise .
he likes salt in his coffee ?
oh , damn it .
you know , when people lock their keys in their car
or sprain their ankle ,
usually indicates that something significant is bothering them .
yeah . a cop was murdered .
yeah . but that &apos;s --
that &apos;s not why you &apos;re salting your coffee .
it &apos;s my brother tommy .
i always wondered about him .
well , frankie and i became cops .
and tommy went to prison
for hitting a priest in a crosswalk .
it was his third strike while driving under the influence .
your poor parents .
and , you know , they keep saying ,
&quot; if the priest that he hit has forgiven him ,
then why can &apos;t we ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t about forgiveness .
you know , tommy is -- is really troubled .
and the more they deny it , the more he screws up .
you really care about him .
i just think that we need to face reality .
you know , tommy needs help .
this isn &apos;t like he broke his leg and it &apos;ll heal .
i &apos;m really sorry .
thank you .
don &apos;t worry about it .
we got too much to do today to worry about tommy .
wish you were out there ?
yeah .
we &apos;ll get the shooter .
i &apos;ll call you as soon as i get the results .
all right .
oh , i got to log this into evidence .
i got to take this to marino .
i &apos;ll see you later .
jane .
yeah ?
if you want to talk about your brother ...
or just avoid the subject , i &apos;m here .
i know .
according to danny &apos;s notes ,
you guys were making inroads into the trucker homicides .
why &apos;d you stop working the case ?
cavanaugh pulled me off the murders .
went back to working drugs in charlestown .
and then there &apos;s -- there &apos;s nothing .
do you know what was danny doing for cavanaugh ?
beats me .
got real secretive all of a sudden .
what ? you guys were partners for years .
why would he shut you out ?
we were partners for nine years .
danny was the best .
i know .
but ...
i mean , you worked drugs . you know what it &apos;s like .
all that money &apos;s ...
well , i knew danny , too , bobby .
what are you trying to say ?
hey . help me out here .
i think danny was dirty .
jane .
yeah ?
sector six officers brought in a woman
they arrested outside the warehouse last night .
what , where danny was shot ?
yep . they grabbed her for crack .
she says that she can give up the shooter .
if we broom her case ?
yeah .
she &apos;s waiting in the interview room .
okay .
want me to go talk to her ?
yeah , yeah .
all right .
okay , i &apos;ll be right back .
nice .
did you see his face ?
i &apos;m not saying anything
until i know that i &apos;m not doing time .
you withhold information about the murder of a boston cop ,
and you &apos;re going back -- no trial , no nothing .
you &apos;ll be eating dinner in jail .
he was a cop ? i didn &apos;t know that he was a cop , okay ?
this is bad . this is really bad .
this is so bad !

did you see his face ?
yeah .
i did -- the both of them .
they are really bad guys . they &apos;re really bad guys .
and they &apos;re gonna come here , and they &apos;re gonna kill me .

yeah .
but i don &apos;t know what to do . what am i supposed to do ?
okay .
i have no p-- what am i supposed to do ?

they won &apos;t think twice about killing you .

they &apos;re watching all the exits .
who are they ?
i don &apos;t know .
i told her i could protect her .
if they were here to kill a witness , why aren &apos;t they gone ?
what &apos;d she say ?
she said she saw danny &apos;s shooter .
said she could i.d. him .
you get a name ?
no , no , nothing .
they ripped apart all the desks in the squad room .
what are they looking for ?
i don &apos;t know .
the , uh -- that walkie -- is it working ?

i &apos;m gonna stay with frankie .
take his shirt off .
jane , what is going on ?
the phones don &apos;t work . there are men shooting here .
i know , i know .
and i think we &apos;re trapped in here .
what about that ?
no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s only for homicide cops ,
and -- and no one &apos;s in range .
okay , lift his shirt up .
okay , okay , okay .
i think i just got the wind knocked out of me . that &apos;s all .
you sure did .
hand us that binder -- the binder on the desk .
we need to keep his head up .
jane , give me your jacket .
okay .
careful , okay ? we &apos;re gonna put you down .
all right .
okay , got your head .
it &apos;s okay .
got it ? okay .
abc &apos;s --
airway , breathing , circulation .
i should &apos;ve taken an emergency @-@ medicine rotation .
all right , take a deep breath .
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t .
what are you hearing ?
j @-@ jane , you can &apos;t -- hey .
it &apos;s all -- it &apos;s fine , okay ?
it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
massive blunt @-@ force trauma caused internal bleeding .
it &apos;s worse than bad .
jenny , if any fingerprints come up on the bruise ,
i want to see .
yes , sir .
any result i wanna hear about it ,
any prints come up , let me know .
peruvian flake always looks like mother of pearl .
why &apos;d they leave the drugs ?
killed a cop .
something must &apos;ve spooked them .
was there a drug aspect to your two murders ?
no .
investigation showed random shootings --
two truckers hauling freight from new york .
i don &apos;t want anybody in here who doesn &apos;t belong .
i want you to go over this truck top to bottom ...
obviously , there &apos;s a lot more to this case .
i want the wheels checked , everything .
why wouldn &apos;t cavanaugh tell you
he was putting danny undercover ?
i don &apos;t know !
but what do you want to bet
my two dead truckers were muling coke ?
what do you think cavanaugh had to do with it ?
nothing , i hope .
let &apos;s find out .
pull up danny &apos;s files on the truckers .
why does everybody always use their birth date ? here it is .
got their application for commercial driver &apos;s licenses .
when did they join the interstate truckers union ?
both got their i.t.u. cards 18 months ago ...
on the same day .
check the union @-@ card prints ,
see if either one of them has a criminal record .
didn &apos;t you check their autopsy prints ?
of course i did . they came up clean .
just run the union @-@ card prints , would you ?
they &apos;re clean , too .
okay .
compare the prints from his union card
with the prints we took at the autopsy .
can &apos;t fake your prints when you &apos;re dead .
look at those whorl patterns .
there is no way those are from the same guy .
did danny keep their files in his personal records ?
right here .
okay , open those .
look at this .
our trucker has multiple arrests
for possession of class @-@ b cocaine .
he used someone else &apos;s prints to get his license .
somebody pulled their records off the system .
and somehow danny got hold of them .
call jane . i want to talk to bobby .
getting voicemail .
she &apos;s probably still interviewing him .
see what danny has on our second dead trucker .
i need an mri or ct scan , an -- an x @-@ ray machine --
something to check his internal injuries .
i was afraid of that .
what ?
tension pneumothorax .
maura , he &apos;s having trouble breathing . do something .
i &apos;m a pathologist . i am not a surgeon .
jane , i could make it worse .
what is it again ? say it again .
t @-@ tension pneumothorax .
okay .
what are you doing ?
&quot; tension pneumothorax results in death
if not -- if not treated immediately . &quot;
oh , god .
jane , i &apos;m just guessing , okay ?
i -- i would need to confirm it .
you don &apos;t have time to confirm it !
your guess is better than most doctors &apos; .
i could be wrong .
&quot; aggressively manage with needle decompression to chest . &quot;
i &apos;ve never done it .
maura !
geez ! g @-@ get a needle . do it .
do it now !
all right .
get a -- get alcohol and a cotton ball and -- and tape .

hey , bud . hey , buddy .

maybe more outside .
what are they carrying ?
i saw two mp5s .
n @-@ no . no . no , he looks better . he -- he looks better .

i think he has a partial tear on one of his lungs ,
maybe other internal organs .

hey , ang .
remember when we took the kids to lake winnipesaukee ?
you know , when we took them all fishing ?
yes . and we had the rowboat that leaked .
oh , yeah !
and janie caught that largemouth bass , you know ?
she was holding it up . she was so proud .

because he didn &apos;t want that fish to die .
i still believe that person is inside of him .
yeah . me too , honey .

i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t have equipment for this .
but you helped him before .
the problem is his heart right now , jane , okay ?
there &apos;s too much pressure from the bleeding .
his heart can &apos;t pump .
please don &apos;t let him die , maura , please .
we -- we can &apos;t get him out of here , okay ?
what can you do right now that will help him ?

smile .
you &apos;re on danny &apos;s camera .
danny didn &apos;t know that you were running the drug ring ,
but he must &apos;ve suspected something .
that &apos;s why he was wearing a wire and carrying a hidden camera .
he just couldn &apos;t stop digging .
that was danny .
i wasn &apos;t planning on killing him ,
but he showed up at the warehouse .
he didn &apos;t leave me any choice .
you killed the other witness , too , didn &apos;t you ?
what &apos;s one less crack whore , right ?
