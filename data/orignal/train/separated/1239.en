Dr. Rollins.
I thought I'd let you know in person.
The judge set a day for the hearing.
The court can compel your friends to come,
but they may not be sympathetic to the cause.
So this court thing...
It's just about how we feel about Charlotte getting out.
It is about A getting out.
Five "A" free years.
What are we gonna do?
You got involved in government first
and your mother is going to be a state senator.
Your bosses are very angry.
They're not angry.
They gave me an advance on a second book.
They know what happened in South America.
College wasn't what I thought it was gonna be.
I had a hard time, when my dad died
I just couldn't see a point to it.
My family has always had a missing part.
What's missing is my sister Charlotte
and now I wanna bring my sister home.
You're here to tell me if you'd feel safe
should Charlotte Dilaurentis leave the hospital?
No, I would not feel safe.
So that's that.
Judge says Charlotte can go home.
Hi, Ali.
Did Charlotte come to your hotel room last night?
I don't know where she is.
You don't know where Charlotte is?
We went to bed and this morning she was gone.
What is she doing here?
Making sure that Charlotte's really dead.
Charlotte was dead when she was thrown from the bell tower.
The death's been ruled a homicide.
You'll get a call.
When did you tell Jordan?
Tell him what?
This town, Charlotte
everything we went through.
She means the things she can't google.
When I knew I was falling in love with him.
Hmm, Liam and I aren't there yet, but...
I know he's gonna have a lot of questions when I get back.
Are you sure you should leave tonight?
You know the cops wanna talk to us before we go.
Yeah, I've already missed a few days of work.
We all have, Aria. We're staying.
Okay, well, my boss asked me to come back.
You guys, this wasn't an easy job to get.
I can't lose it.
They're gonna ask us questions about that night.
Yeah, we were all together
and none of us left the hotel. What else is there to say?
I think the person the cops should really be talking to
is right over there.
Can she really not sign her own name?
I still haven't told anyone about what happened, have you?
Do we really believe she doesn't remember?
I think she's lying.
Just like she lied about having
Swedish syndrome to get her sentence reduced.
Stockholm syndrome. And it is a real thing.
She was never kidnapped, Spencer.
She was living out in the world.
She chose to help Charlotte torture us.
You know, the judge didn't see it that way.
If Sara really was brainwashed, she'd have a pretty
strong motive to kill Charlotte. Revenge.
Oh, I hate to break up this party, but I gotta get going.
I'll walk you to your car.
Okay.
I'll call you soon.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you too.
Hey, um, I didn't wanna say anything in front of the others
but I know that you left the hotel
the night Charlotte was killed.
Where did you go?
I got up around 3 A.M. to hydrate and I saw you leave.
I had to check my messages and, um, then my phone died
so I, I had to grab my charger from my car.
Then what?
I came back to the room.
You were gone longer than that. I tried to wait up.
Hanna, you're remembering it wrong.
Which isn't a surprise considering how wasted you got.
I wasn't that drunk.
You threw up in a bathtub.
That was Emily, not me.
Look, all I'm saying is
if you did go somewhere, we should know.
Well, I didn't, so there's nothing to tell.
Okay.
I have a plane to catch.
Mom, Caleb just got here.
Already you're putting him to work?
What's wrong?
The news of Charlotte's death is spreading fast.
Some bloggers are trying to link you and the girls to it.
Why am I not surprised?
I am. It's a disgusting thing to do.
My opponent is running a dirty campaign.
Well, how do you know that she's behind this?
I'm trying to figure out where it's coming from.
It doesn't matter. It's already out there.
And it would be a mistake for me to go
with you to your interview tomorrow.
Why?
Because I'd be a distraction.
Honey, the "Rosewood Observer" has more class
than to pay attention to a few tasteless tweets.
Mom, I'm partially responsible for Charlotte's getting out.
On the night that she did, she was killed.
So whichever way they spin it, her death and my association
to it will come up and it's best
if I'm not with you when it does.
Hey, I found a link to a blog that originated in Rosewood.
It's been shared over 400 times.
Maybe it is best if you skipped this one.
Yeah.
I'll call my team.
And see if they can get a handle on this.
Okay.
I am really afraid that she's gonna lose
this election because of me.
Hey, don't say that.
I'll hack into the voting machines
and make sure that she wins.
Caleb.
I'm kidding.
Look, they have 400 retweets.
I will get 4000 good ones by tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Yeah.
I'm really glad that you're here.
Me too.
Alison.
Her burns severely limit her ability to use her hands.
She couldn't have done this.
You're taking Sara off the suspect list.
I don't understand.
Charlotte's death was violent.
There was a struggle.
You sure you wanna hear this?
I need to know what happened to my sister.
Her neck was broken by a blunt force trauma
before she was thrown from the bell tower.
I'm sorry, Alison.
We're looking at everyone, but particularly
the people Charlotte targeted.
Do you think your friends could have had anything
to do with Charlotte's death?
No, I don't.
You sure about that?
That's great.
9:00 works.
I'll see you in the morning. Thanks.
How was the service?
Um, Ali said some nice things and her doctor..
Did you go to the cemetery?
No. Why?
Well, the Dilaurentis' plot is close to ours, so..
No, we just left after the service.
Look, why don't you come with me tomorrow morning?
We could water the flowers and say hi to dad.
Yeah, 'cause I don't need to see where he's buried to say hi.
Okay, but you haven't seen it.
And since the funeral you haven't even seen his headstone.
I'm sorry. I can't do it tomorrow.
I promised Ali I'd be available to her all day
and she really needs me, so..
I'm gonna take a shower.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong room.
I didn't order that.
I did.
Jordan. How did you--
I got the key from your mom. I wanted to surprise you.
I thought the magazine was going to print tomorrow.
It is, but the cops wanna talk to you
and that trumps work for me.
How are you?
I'm better now that you're here.
Champagne? What are we celebrating?
Us.
I spoke to my uncle and he has agreed to let us
have the estate for the wedding.
In the Hamptons?
Wow, that's amazing, but--
I'm not rushing you, but..
...I had to come here with some good news.
I'm sorry, it's just..
between Charlotte's death and the cops circling us
I feel like I'm in a time warp.
I don't want you to worry about that, okay?
I spoke to my mom's lawyer.
He has agreed to come down here go to station with you.
That's really not necessary.
I know how the cops have treated you in the past
and we shouldn't take any chances.
Maybe we should just go back to New York tonight.
Hanna, once the cops talk to you
and realize you had nothing to do with this
it will all be over.
I just want this day to be over.
Well, just because you had a bad day..
doesn't mean it has to end that way.
Fettuccine from Balthazar.
Frisee salad from Dean and Duluca.
And a red velvet cupcake
From the Greenwich Bakery.
Aria, hey. Uh, come in.
Uh, I only have a minute.
I'm on my way to the airport. I just..
I just needed to stop by and clear the air before I leave.
We didn't see each other the night that Charlotte was killed.
You didn't call me. I didn't leave the hotel.
We didn't walk or talk or go anywhere.
Understood?
Whatever you say, Aria.
That hurt?
no.
I've just never been really good with needles.
Oh, you'll get used to them.
The injections too.
So are you in school or working?
Um, work and school.
I've a couple classes left before I graduate.
Just hold that there, please.
So you're going to, uh, Hollis?
Oh, no. Pepperdine.
I'm actually in San Diego now though for work.
Well, you live in California
but you're doing your treatments here?
Is that bad?
Travel puts a lot of stress on the body.
It's really best if you complete your treatments in one place.
Will that be a problem?
No. No problem.
I just, I really need this to work.
Oh, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Well, see you tomorrow, okay?
"The flower was placed in her hand
"to make it look like a suicide.
"Her fingernails were wiped clean.
So were her hands."
I'm so sorry, Ali.
Who would do something like this?
Sara Harvey.
Well, the police can't see how she could push someone
off a building when she can barely hold a fork.
Maybe she's lying about that.
Or maybe she had help.
Either way, they took her off the suspect list.
Aria left town quickly.
She had to go back to work.
Well, she was still angry with Charlotte.
She wasn't angry. She was scared.
And she said everything that she needed
to say up on that stand.
I saw her dad this morning.
He said that she left town one day earlier than planned.
I was hoping that you guys would come to dinner tonight.
Emily, Caleb. Jordan too.
I could really use the company.
It's been really lonely in that house.
Sure.
What should we bring?
Welcome back, Montgomery.
Good morning, Mr. Greene.
Staff meeting. Two minutes.
Be right there.
Mmm. God, I missed you.
I missed you too.
And this.
What? Work?
Yeah, work.
Boston. Normalcy.
Yeah, I still can't believe what happened.
Aria, are you okay? Are-are you freaked out?
No, I'm okay. Kinda freaked out.
But mainly I'm just glad to get back to regular life.
Oh, we should get to that meeting.
Yeah, we-we should.
Oh, how was Ezra Fitz?
Did you talk to him?
Briefly.
He's thinking about giving back that advance.
Oh, Jillian's not gonna like that.
No, she won't.
What?
无效信用卡
Is it broken?
Um, yeah, yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe.
You're Emily, right?
This thing can be finicky sometimes.
Let me try.
I'm sorry, I don't have any cash on me right now--
Not a problem. Really.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
So what should we take to Alison's? Sushi?
The only tuna you're gonna find in this town is out of a can.
Then I guess Thai food is out of the question too?
Unless you wanna go back to New York.
If we leave now, we can make an 8 o'clock reservation.
Are you worried about spending the night with Alison
or introducing me to Caleb?
Both.
I will be on my best behavior, okay?
Alright, keep the conversation light
and we'll leave right after after we eat.
Deal?
Yeah, fine.
But if we're going there, we're not just bringing food.
The police thinks that the murder was premeditated.
That's why they're looking at us.
Alright, let them look.
They'll see that you put what happened behind you
and you've moved on.
You know it hasn't been that easy.
Going to therapy isn't a strike against you.
You need a lot to overcome.
I still am overcoming it.
It's not gonna make anybody think
that you're capable of murder.
No, this might.
What is this?
It's a paper that I wrote my sophomore year at Georgetown.
'Each of us had to do a case study'
'on a unique murder and I did mine on a woman'
'who was killed on her wedding night.'
Did you know that it's human instinct to go head first
when you leap to your death?
No.
'Well, it is.'
'And later on, they discovered that her neck'
was broken before she fell.
She was found holding her bridal bouquet
and her fingernails were wiped clean.
What class was this for?
It's for Criminology.
Look, that's exactly the way that Charlotte died.
What if somebody knows that I wrote this paper
they know my history here and they're trying to set me up?
Spence, breathe.
Being back here is making you paranoid.
Nobody's trying to hurt you, okay?
I'm telling you
this is all just one big coincidence.
I don't think the police are gonna see it that way.
You told me you had a relationship with this person.
Ezra Fitz was my high school English teacher.
And he told you he's gonna give back the advance back?
Well...He said he's thinking about it.
You heard about what happened to his girlfriend.
He's not in a good place right now.
No writer is ever in a good place, Aria.
I thought the teacher angle would help
but perhaps that's the problem.
Maybe Fitz isn't taking you seriously
because you were his student.
Liam, I want you to take over.
Take over?
Jillian, it's not Aria's fault.
'She went to testify at this hearing'
'and there was a murder in this town--'
Liam's right.
I just, I got really distracted
but it won't happen again.
Jillian, I know this author.
I can get through to him better than anyone else.
This isn't personal, Aria.
I just want somebody to bring back the book we paid for.
Liam, you can stay.
Hey, Sabrina.
Hey, hi.
Do you have a sec?
Sure.
Um, Ezra says that you manage the place now.
He put me in charge when he and Nicole went to Colombia.
They thought it'd be a month long thing.
Hell of a way to get promoted.
Yeah. Well, I won't keep you.
I just wanted to stop by and ask you a favor.
Sure.
Um, could you not tell anyone
that you saw me outside at the medical center today?
I'm not quite sure who I would tell.
I know, it's just my mom comes here sometimes
and my friends and..
Yeah. I won't say anything.
Thanks.
Emily...I had cancer..
...several years ago.
I didn't want people to know.
I didn't want them to think of me
as the sick girl with cancer.
But I learned the hard way you need support
when you're going through something like that.
I don't know what I would have done without my family my friends.
I don't wanna make assumptions about what you're going through.
No, I'm, I'm sorry, you had to deal with that
but I'm fine.
And the last thing I need to do
is to give my mom something else to worry about.
Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
You guys bring enough food?
Oh, there's more.
Hey, Hanna. Hi, Jordan.
Hey, Jordan.
Hey.
So good to see you.
You too.
Uh, Jordan, this is Caleb. Caleb, Jordan.
I finally get to meet the Caleb Rivers.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.
Any chance you wanna help me
get the last load of food from the car?
Uh, yeah. How much did you guys bring?
I know. I come from a big family.
Always over-order.
They'll be fine.
How are you doing?
I'm holding up, I guess.
I'm glad everyone could make it
except for Aria.
Has anyone talked to her?
Uh, not since she left.
Yeah, I've called her a few times.
She hasn't returned my calls.
She's probably just busy with work.
What are you doing?
I was just gonna make some room.
I bought those for Charlotte to welcome her home.
Spence.
Okay. Well, then the flowers can stay there.
I'll go get some serving spoons.
That was weird.
Yeah, maybe she knows about us.
This is her way of pitting us against each other.
I don't know. I think she just wants her pages.
We can figure this out.
If Fitz isn't taking you seriously, then I'll go--
That's not the issue.
Then-then what is?
Aria.
Wh-what's going on?
Ezra Fitz is not the same person that you met
on his book tour two years ago.
But I am gonna talk to Jillian
and I'm gonna convince her to give me another shot.
Yeah, you should.
Just duck if she picks up the phone, okay?
For how long?
Couple of weeks.
Maybe a month.
My mom asked me to stick around for a while.
The Salk Institute won't mind?
No.
What do you do there?
Um, we research cures.
Alzheimer's, diabetes
Infectious diseases.
Damn.
Well, you'll save 'em, I'll dress 'em.
Oh, perfect.
And I think it goes in this way.
God, there's four bottles of wine
and nobody can find a wine opener.
This is not happening.
Uh, it's actually, it's backwards.
I used to have one just like it.
You kinda have to angle the leaves down.
Oh, the one with the scratch on it?
Yeah, it's the first piece of furniture
we put into the new place.
Hanna wouldn't let go of it.
Caleb?
Yeah.
Um, I can't find any wine glasses.
You wanna go check the pantry for me?
Yeah.
Nice.
So do you and Caleb see much of each other in DC?
Uh, yeah, we do.
I mean, I don't really see much of anybody except for my phone.
But of all the people that I don't see
I don't see Caleb the most.
The least.
Uh, it's nice you keep in contact.
I barely see any of my friends from high school.
Oh, we didn't, uh, for a while.
And then we ran into each other in Madrid.
It was crazy. It was a total fluke.
I was just finishing my year abroad
And he was backpacking through Europe.
I was about to get on a train in Salamanca
and I heard my name and I looked up
and he was just standing there
On the opposite platform.
Wow. That sounds amazing.
Yeah, it was.
Have you seen any wine glasses?
Ali de-boozifed the place when she thought
Charlotte was coming home.
But I'll help you find the wine glasses
if you help me find an opener.
Deal.
Jordan seems nice.
He is.
Uh, congrats on your engagement.
I-I meant to say that yesterday. Sorry.
Thank you.
So you kept the table?
Of course, I did.
Look, when you left for Europe
I wanted to focus on my career.
I wasn't looking for another relationship.
You seem happy.
I am.
I'm glad.
Uh, found them.
Looks like we got what we need.
Thank you. I, uh, I appreciate you calling.
Ali, who was that?
Lorenzo. He said he'd call with any updates.
What was it? The update?
Time of death.
Charlotte was killed around 4:00 A.M.
Are you okay?
Lorenzo says this is good news.
They're one step closer to finding her killer.
Let's say grace.
Hanna, hand.
Thank you, heavenly father.
For this healing food and these dear friends.
And thank you to all those who are working tirelessly
to seek justice for Charlotte.
And thank you for helping the police find Charlotte's killer.
And anyone who could be protecting him or her.
Thank you always for your guidance and love.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
That was awkward.
Was that speech directed at us?
Not at us, but Aria maybe.
Why would Ali think that Aria had anything to do
with Charlotte's death?
Maybe she did.
Aria left the hotel the night that she was killed.
How do you know this?
I saw her.
She left around 3:00 A.M. and I don't know when she got back.
Let's just ask her.
Well, I tried that.
She denied going anywhere but her car.
Okay, well, there are surveillance cameras, right?
in the lobby of the hotel?
Yeah.
Your mom's the manager.
So maybe you could find a way
to get a look at the footage from that night.
No. I'm don't do stuff like that anymore.
Hanna, I know it's a lot to ask, okay?
But how else are we supposed to make sure
that Aria came back before Charlotte died?
How's Alison doin'?
Um, she's dealing in her own Aali way.
Well, I'm sure it helps having you around.
Showing there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
Hollis Medical Center? Wait, you have an appointment?
Are you feeling okay?
I'm fine.
I-it's just an interview..
for grad school.
Grad school at Hollis?
Oh, why didn't you tell me you were applying?
I'm just exploring my options. I mean, honestly it's..
The institute just wanted me to look into it.
Okay.
So what are you thinking?
I mean, you've always talked about sports medicine.
You know who you should talk to? Aunt Kathy.
She's a nurse practitioner.
Right?
Here you go, ladies.
Let me know if you need anything else.
You know, honey, if you're worried about paying
for it, you shouldn't be.
Dad left you all that money for exactly this reason
And you can just take out a loan for the rest.
You know, all the work you're doing
the person you've become
your dad would be really proud of you, Emmy.
I wasn't expecting anyone.
I thought you went back to Boston.
I did. I flew back to talk to you.
Oh! Well, you could've called.
My boss has this thing about how it's harder
to say no in person.
This is about the book.
Drink?
No, thank you.
They won't take back the advance.
Ah! So they are mad.
N-not mad.
They just loved "Ostinato."
Well, it made them money.
It made them feel things.
It's a really good book, Ezra
And I am not just saying that to flatter you. It is.
I promise you they are not going to love the follow-up.
That's it? That's the book?'
It's as far as I got.
Can I look at it?
Hey, first draft is a first draft.
I'm sure it's not that bad.
That night after we saw each other
after I went back to the hotel
Where did you go?
What are you asking me?
You know what I'm asking you.
Where did you go?
Home. I..
I went home.
Spence, stop worrying about the paper.
You gotta let it go.
Are you sure you're okay sleeping on the couch again?
Yeah, totally.
It's a lot more comfortable than those hostel beds in Europe.
Can you believe that it's been three years
since we were in Madrid?
That's crazy.
I don't think I'm ever gonna forgive you
for dragging me to that awful bullfight.
Come on, it was not that awful.
It-it was awful when you started screaming
savages at the drunk crowd.
It was terrible from the beginning.
That's why I was screaming.
It was awful.
Okay.
You made me cry.
I didn't make you do anything.
You didn't stop me from crying in the street.
You were, you were pretty livid.
It was not okay.
But, hey, I redeemed myself when I snuck us into Retiro Park
with a couple bottles of Sangria.
Yeah, you did.
Oh, my god, that was the most beautiful sunrise.
Yeah.
It was my best night in Europe.
Mine too. Hands down.
Uh, hey, your mom asked me to..
stick around and help with the campaign.
That's a great idea.
汉娜
Let me know if you need anything.
Thank you.
Where does Jordan think you are?
Talking to my mom.
There she is.
It's 3:12.
What the hell was Ezra doing there?
So much for just going to her car.
Hey, the hallway's clear
but there's a cleaning crew down the hall.
Okay, hurry.
I'm going as fast as I can.
What did I miss?
Aria left the hotel with Ezra.
What?
But she didn't come back with him.
It's 4:28.
What time did Ali say that cCharlotte was killed?
Close to 4:00.
Just because she came back after the time of murder
it doesn't mean that she had anything to do with it.
No, but it doesn't look good.
What do we do? Do we erase the video?
We're not in high school, Emily. We're gonna talk to Aria.
She won't tell us anything.
Well, she doesn't have a choice this time.
How did you know I was back?
I saw you visiting Ezra.
We know you saw him the night Charlotte died.
We know you left the hotel for more than five minutes.
Yeah, and by the time you came back
Charlotte was already dead.
It's time to tell us what really happened that night.
You didn't have to come by.
Well, you said you couldn't sleep.
Ugh, I can't.
I just keep going over what I said to the judge.
God, that look on Ali's face.
Look, what you said was honest and brave.
So if your friends are giving you a hard time--
No, no, no, no, they're not...At all.
They'd actually wish that they'd said the same thing.
I mean, that's the crazy part.
I-I just thought if one of us had said no
that that would just be the end of it.
Yeah, me too.
Hey, can we go somewhere?
Anywhere but here.
Of course.
Why is everything closed?
It's suburban Pennsylvania and about 4:00 A.M.
Yeah, I want pizza.
Doesn't anybody care that I want pizza?
You know, I know this little
bookstore cafe around the corner.
It's closed, but I happen to know the owner.
No, no, I should go. It's late.
Yeah, sure.
Is that Alison? Looks like her car.
I think that's Charlotte.
Do we call someone? Do we call the police?
No, Aria. She's free now.
It's her town now as much as ours.
Oh, she's free and she's already lurking in the shadows.
Why the hell is she not home with Ali?
'cause that's the kind of world we live in.
People like Nicole disappear and Charlotte gets to walk free.
Ezra.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah. You know, it's-it's getting late.
You should probably get back to your hotel.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
He told me he went home afterwards.
But...I don't know.
He-he was so angry.
Aria, what is it?
I know him.
And I know that Ezra can't look me in the eye when he lies.
And when he told me he went home, he didn't..
look at me.
Well, we have to tell someone.
Lorenzo, Ali, anyone.
No, we don't.
Now this is a giant leap.
We're talking about Ezra killing someone.
I mean, until we have actual proof
we don't tell anyone anything.
It's not.
It's not a giant leap.
In fact, I think I told Ezra how to do it.
Ezra was on his book tour,
we got some time to lunch.
He was still trying to figure out what he wanted
to write next and he said that he was toying around
with the idea of a murder mystery.
I had just written my paper, so I told him about the case
in detail.
Maybe Ezra did do this to protect you.
Protect me?
By copying some bizarre murder from the past?
Spencer, this was a public case.
You are the only two who knew about it.
He saw how upset Aria was in the courtroom.
And he's still angry about what happened to Nicole.
I mean, who knows what he's capable of now?
If he did kill Charlotte and the police find out,
it's gonna look like you were involved too.
You left the hotel with Ezra and you came back a half hour
after Charlotte was killed.
Nobody can see that security footage.
Why did you show this to me?
I wanted you to know that I wrote it.
Somebody from my class could remember it
and read about Charlotte and connect the dots.
What dots?
Do you know anything about what happened to Charlotte?
No.
Then I'm not worried.
Mom, how can you not worry?
If this gets out, it's going to ruin your campaign
If I haven't done that already.
You haven't. And it won't.
We'll get ahead of this.
How?
Caleb already started a narrative
about you being bullied on social media.
If this comes up, it'll already be diffused.
You are not a liability, Spencer.
You're my daughter.

I was in class when mom called the school.
Human anatomy.
Everything we went through in high school.
I thought we were done with disasters.
The next semester
nothing made sense anymore.
If you really are watching over me, then..
I guess you know this already.
I flunked two classes
and they took my scholarship away.
After that, I, I couldn't go back there.
I flew home that summer and I was, was ready
to tell mom about everything, but..
she was such a mess..
And I couldn't do it.
I know that I messed up..
Okay, but I'm going to fix it.
I am fixing it.
Everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thank you for coming over.
Ali, what's this about?
Last night you asked me if I thought my friends
had anything to do with Charlotte's murder.
Do you wanna change your answer?
Yes.
