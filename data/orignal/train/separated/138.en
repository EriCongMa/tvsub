第七季 第十八集
So, Greek Orthodox, huh?
I'm just curious.
Yep.
For how long?
Long time.
Your parents?
Yeah, I have parents.
Were your parents Greek Orthodox?
Yeah.
So you believe in god?
Yep.
You believe he's watching us now?
Yeah.
‭So you believe this is fornication.
First two were.
The last one-- I don't know what I would call that.
Does it bother you?
A bit.
Oh, no.
This fallen woman is dragging you down.
You know what's weird?
I'm more judgmental about my daughter's christianity than yours.
Why is that?
I don't know.
You're a bad person.
I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong
when you're with me.
Yeah, you do.
Yeah, I guess I do.
What time is it?
It is ten after 9:00.
It's probably Diane.
Yep.
Hey, Diane.
Yes.
Okay. I'll see you there.
Court?
Yeah. Another Dipple case.
Privacy this time.
‭Don't get up.
I want to picture you in my bed.
All day.
Just eating bonbons, watching daytime tv.
You have a nice day, dear.
This is the footage taken from Ms. Hamm's drone?
Yes, that's my understanding.
And that, that is your house right there, isn't it?
Yes. 1547 Oakmont.
Did you grant permission for the drone to fly over it?
No. Absolutely not.
And how often does it do that?
Every day. Sometimes several times a day,
At unpredictable times.
It has to be unpredictable.
That's the basic principle of security sweeps.
Ms. Hamm, please.
Your lawyer will argue for you.
And, uh, why is the drone such a problem for you?
Well, it's my business.
I'm a therapist. I practice out of my house.
And do your patients complain?
Yes. Some have even quit.
They depend on me for privacy and they get this-- surveillance.
And that is why you're suing
the owner of the drone?
Yes.
Her drone has led to my business losses.
Thank you. Nothing more.
Look at her.
‭Do patients Park in your garage, Dr. Nachmann?
My garage?
No. I turned that into my office.
I see. Then do patients enter your garage office
through a covered walkway?
No.
So they park on the street,
then walk up to your house,
where anyone who happens to be around could see them?
Yes.
‭How is that different from being observed by a drone?
Well, I guess you expect it from someone on the street
but not from the sky.
And how much are you suing my client for, sir?
$300,000.
And yet you have two top partners at your table.
Objection, Your Honor.
I haven't even gotten to my question yet.
Why don't we wait till she gets to her question,
then I'll sustain.
I used to work for their firm, Your Honor.
And this case wouldn't even be considered
unless there was an ulterior motive.
Objection, Your Honor.
That has nothing to do with this case.
But it does, Your Honor.
This case is a fiction. It is a trial balloon sent up
by Reese Dipple, a reactionary billionaire
who thinks that we are out to take
Your Honor, she is trying
their guns, their christmases...
to play to your bias.
and the sanctity of their homes.
Yes. And yet...
We have to deal with the case in front of us.
I agree.
I just wish the plaintiffs were more honest.
Well, this is a surprise.
When did you come back to the law?
A month ago.
Zoe started nursery school.
Is that your daughter?
Yes.
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
So you're happy?
I am.
And you're good in court.
How did you know it was Dipple?
It was a guess.
Two partners on this case, it made no sense.
I learned from the best.
Is my wife here?
She's in court.
You're her investigator?
Yeah.
We are still married.
I'll get my things.
Yeah, that would be good.
How long has this been going on?
That's a question for Alicia.
Does Grace know?
Again...
Alicia.
You're in my way.
You're screwing my wife
and I'm in your way?
At the moment, yes.
I should kick your ass.
You could try.
And then what?
One goji-gasm with a virility boost!
Good luck with that.
I know who you are.
And I know who you are.
So we can skip the part where you pretend you want to date me.
What can I help you with, sir?
You can help me put Peter Florrick in jail.
How 'bout a super-c quencher instead?
Well, I can subpoena you to testify against your father.
Okay, here's the thing: I am nobody.
My last five jobs, I needed to wear name tags.
I live with three roommates, and one is a squatter.
This has nothing to do with me. So you and your little...
FBI friend should take your show somewhere else.
"Judge Schakowsky won't be a problem."
"How can you be sure"" "He owes me. He'd be in jail
right now on bribery charges if I hadn't warned him""
Hi, this is Marissa from the Juice Bar.
We need mall security. There's a man here
harassing employees, who refuses to leave.
I want you to give your father a message From me, Ms. Gold.
I don't know. Let me ask him.
How tall are you?
Tell him he has two choices.
He can testify against Peter Florrick,
Or I can use your testimony to put him in jail
for obstruction of justice.
Looks like 5-11,
dark hair, kind of a mean look in his eye.
Wait, I think he's leaving.
Thanks.
Howard!
How can I be of service?
We need you to move offices.
Why? I like this office.
It's close to the bathroom.
You're emeritus, Howard.
And this is A high profile, very visible space.
Where clients can get a good look at your...
Your work ethic.
We have a space on the 27th floor.
It's all arranged.
27th floor?
That's for losers.
This isn't a negotiation, Howard.
And who, uh, may I ask, am I being evicted for?
Alicia.
Alicia. Of course.
It's all beginning to make sense.
All right. I need to get to court.
But, please, let's get this moving.
So you're, uh...
Throwing in with the girls, huh?
I'm not "Throwing in"" With anyone, howard.
I'm just trying to do what's best for the firm.
We've had problems with mail theft,
bikes gone missing, a car vandalized.
So that's when you bought the drone
and started Picketfencewatch.Com?
Yes. It's too big an area for volunteers to secure,
so the drone makes it easier to monitor.
Have any of your other neighbors complained about your drone?
Or is it just Dr. Nachmann?
No. People love it.
Thank you, Ms. Hamm. Being a mother myself,
I can understand the worth of such a safety tool.
Objection. Counselor is testifying.
Actually, my apologies, I thought I was just reacting.
Really? Is that what a reaction sounds like?
Yes, the same way you're reacting now.
Excuse me. Please let me rule on the objection.
Sustained.
Nothing further, your honor.
So why not just fly it over your other neighbors' houses
and leave Dr. Nachmann alone?
Avoiding his house would mean not covering
a lot of other people who want it.
But by "Covering" This area, you mean not just
the public area, like the street,
you also look into people's backyards.
I have to.
Criminals don't just use the front door.
Do you ever pick up images from inside their houses?
No.
Is that a person there,
inside their house?
I guess.
Did that person give you permission To photograph them?
I would never upload anything like that to the site.
‭Your Honor,
This is a clear case of intrusion upon seclusion.
It is well-established that a person
has a reasonable expectation
to privacy in his own home.
No, it is a clear case of Reese Dipple trying
to create law.
Your Honor!
Look! The expectation of privacy
is in relation to government surveillance.
If Dr. Nachmann simply uses some discretion
by pulling his blinds...
He shouldn't have to.
Your honor, we have to weigh the minor inconvenience
to Dr. Nachmann against the significant
public interest in preventing crime.
So we do.
The incursions into our privacy are already so severe, Judge.
As much as I despair and sympathize
with our privacy being trampled on by new technologies,
the facts in this case simply don't warrant abridging
Ms. Hamm's first amendment rights.
Dr. Nachmann, your petition for a declaratory judgment is denied.
The drone can fly.
What the hell are you doing?
Not you. I'll call you back.
I've been booted.
Exiled to the 27th floor.
For doing what?
Nothing. Make room for Alicia.
The next step in Diane's push for an all-female-led firm.
Diane pushed,
but the gerbil... Stood by-- he never said a word.
Cary's in on this?
First she came for the young guys,
Then the older guys.
Pretty soon... There won't be anybody left to speak for you.
Are you all right?
you seem a little out of it.
Just tired.
Well, why don't you go home?
No.
Well, maybe in a little while.
It's been a weird time, huh?
What do you mean?
Us jumping from firm to firm.
All the changes.
It was easier when we started out.
Well...
Yeah.
Not necessarily better.
Go home, Cary. Take a nap.
An afternoon off isn't gonna change anything.
作证传票
That's your client.
We're countersuing.
That drone was an $80,000 prototype.
And we'll assess punitive.
See you in court, then.
Your offices look great, by the way.
Dipple won't back our client after that, will he?
I don't know. The doctor has good aim...
And Reese Dipple loves the second amendment.
Sorry I'm late.
Jason?
Hey, this is Jason. Leave a message.
Hey. Where are you?
I'm alone here.
Call me when you get this.
未接来电
I'm just saying, he knew details.
What kind of details?
He had a transcript
of an entire phone conversation you and I had.
About?
Judge schakowsky.
He... what?
How you tipped that Judge off about the FBI sting.
The only way he could know that
is if he had a wiretap in the governor's office.
Is he insane?
He's like an evil boy scout.
He said he wants you to testify against Peter at the trial.
‭Wait... Did he say "Trial" or "Grand jury"?
"Trial," I think. Is that important?
If he said "Trial," that means he knows
he's gonna get an indictment.
He definitely said "Trial""
Damn it!
That's you shooting the drone down, isn't it?
Yes. That is me.
Your honor, we request an immediate judgment
as a matter of law-- Dr. Nachmann just admitted
to violating your ruling.
Your honor, you said the drone could fly.
You didn't say Mr. Nachmann couldn't protect his property.
Oh, come on.
Is that an objection?
No, it's an expression of amazement.
Show me in the order where...
No one needs to spell it out.
No one did spell it out.
And by analogy to the rule of lenity...
解读必须倾向于对被告有利
Oh, lenity. Where are we going next,
Expressio unius?
则排除其他未指定的人或物
Oh, well, now that you mention it...
Your Yonor, please,
isn't it implicit in your order
not to shoot at my client's drone?
Why?
It's illegal to discharge a firearm
in Chicago but not in Oak Park.
It's not the weapon we're objecting to.
It's the target.
We ask for compensatory damages in the amount
of $80,000, and $10,000 in punitives,
along with a clear instruction from the court
that the defendant may not shoot drones out of the sky.
Actually, Your Honor, I would like an opportunity
to examine him first.
He's already admitted to shooting it down.
But he didn't admit to doing anything wrong.
May I?
By all means.
Dr. Nachmann, did you feel threatened by the drone
flying over your house yesterday?
Yes. I did.
Threatened? Seriously?
Did you believe it was making
a violent, riotous, or tumultuous assault?
Yeah, with all the noise and the hovering, absolutely.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Did you believe
what you did was necessary to repel the drone?
Very much so.
720 ILCS 5/7-2 allows the use of force
in defense of one's dwelling.
Castle doctrine? You're applying castle doctrine?
Your Honor, this is still about Mr. Dipple's
libertarian fantasies...
Again, the plaintiff is attempting to provoke bias.
Castle doctrine allows the use of force
to the extent necessary to terminate or prevent unlawful entry.
Are you saying Dr. Nachmann thought
the drone was going to enter his home?
Drones are capable of doing more than record video, Your Honor.
They can steal, interfere with,
and destroy things inside the house
without ever entering.
The drone overflight was a de facto intrusion,
which means castle doctrine applies.
Honestly... is that a reasonable fear?
No!
Yes!
Then prove it.
You just sat there
and let Diane beam Alicia up to our floor?
Do you realize that the camel's nose is already in our tent...
That was the lesser of two evils.
What's the other evil?
Having a pantless octogenarian scaring away clients.
We're name partners, David.
Nobody can move us out.
Together we have more equity
in this place than Diane does. And...
if we have to play that trump card... so be it.
I don't know if you're confident or covering,
but I do know this: This is war.
And before the women make their next move,
we need to fire a shot across their bow.
Mr. Pert, what are we seeing there?
An unmanned aircraft system--
Drone, in common parlance--
modified to carry AR-15 machine gun.
With all due respect, Dr. Nachmann would have known
if Ms. Hamm's drone was carrying a machine gun.
Thank you, Your Honor.
But drones can carry more than just machine guns, can't they?
Absolutely.
Did that drone have a handgun attached to it?
A Beretta pico.
Only about five inches long.
Drones can be fitted to carry virtually any weapon.
Okay, uh, this is, uh, entertaining,
but I'm not sure why it's relevant.
It's not.
The havoc that drones can wreak
isn't limited to weapons, is it, doctor?
‭No. It's almost impossible to tell unless you take it apart,
but this drone has a camera that does thermal imaging.
Now, this drone looks like a basic hobbyist's toy,
when, in fact, it's equipped with a... Wi-Fi router
that tricks your computer into connecting with it.
And what happens when they connect?
It steals your personal data: contacts bank information.
I think it's been established that
my client's drone has none of these modifications.
Yes, but our client had no way of knowing.
Isn't that right, doctor?
Drones can absolutely intrude
on a person's home without entering it.
If that's what Dr. Nachmann said he was afraid of, he's smart.
You study and develop drone technology
at Chicago Polytech, is that right?
Yes.
Would that include the study of flight paths and trajectories?
Yes, of course.
Now, if you could tell me,
before my client's drone is shot out of the sky,
is it hovering in a stationary position,
or moving toward Dr. Nachmann's home?
Well, that drone actually looks like
it's flying away from the house.
So even if Ms. Hamm's drone had
attempted a violent or illegal intrusion,
it was in fact retreating.
And under Illinois law, including the castle doctrine,
it is illegal to shoot an intruder in the back
if he, or in this case it, is retreating.
Damn.
Yep.
She's right on the law.
Damages in the amount of $10,000 are awarded to Ms. Hamm.
Dr. Nachmann... don't shoot at drones.
Nice office.
It's very comfortable. Thank you.
‭Terrific.
Because I think you're gonna be in here for a while.
I need examples where a pre-nup was deemed invalid
due to... unconscionable terms.
Okay. Illinois, right?
Illinois, but I want to be belt-and-suspenders on this.
Let's make it a 50-state survey.
Great. Uh, but Alicia has asked me
to finish this business development plan.
Let me give you three reasons why I don't care.
Number one: I outrank Alicia.
Numbers two and three:
they don't matter,
because I outrank alicia.
Your intimidation tactics may have worked on my daughter,
but they will not work on me!
Hello, Eli. Would you like to sit down?
You do not want the inspector general,
let alone The New York Times, to learn that you put
a wiretap in the office of a sitting governor!
Will you please give us a second?
I didn't tap his office, Eli.
I tapped your daughter's phone.
You wh...
Yep. Awful, huh?
The lengths an AUSA will go to arrest someone
who simply does something... criminal.
She worked for Lloyd Garber,
who I was investigating,
so I had probable cause.
My daughter knows nothing about anything illegal
Lloyd Garber or Peter Florrick did...
may have done.
Agreed. But she does have knowledge
of something illegal you did.
You're squeezing my daughter to get to me.
I'm not a big fan of the word "squeezing," but...
Yes.
‭I know nothing about the Locke mistrial.
Good. Then you have nothing to worry about.
You have a choice, a simple choice.
Help me take down Peter Florrick,
or your daughter helps me take you down.
All right, then, I will see you tomorrow.
No, just a few questions.
Thank you.
What are you doing working up here?
I don't know. It's quieter.
I missed you last night.
Just... work.
Well, what are you doing tonight?
Look, Alicia...
I like you. I like you a lot.
Seriously?
What do you want me to say?
I don't want you to say anything.
I want you to do what you did the other day.
I want you...
She was...
Can you give us a minute? Please?
I want to use you and I want you to use me.
This is purely sexual.
I like it, too.
Is this about your religion?
No.
Because I don't want your spirit.
I want your body.
It's not about that.
Then what?
Your husband came home yesterday morning.
Oh, God.
What?
Look, whatever he said,
whatever he did, it has nothing to do with us.
I just don't like coming in the middle of something.
We'll meet at your place tonight.
No. It's not really...
Well, then we'll go to a hotel.
Side of the road. Backseat of my car.
I'm seeing you tonight. At my apartment.
After that, you can do whatever you want.
Alicia, how are you?
Peachy.
Your client shot down another drone.
This time, not with a gun,
but with an electronic device called a Drone Dropper.
Alicia, you need to talk to your client.
I don't need to do anything.
Alicia, I'm a little busy here.
Give me a second.
What's going on?
Alicia?
I want a divorce.
I want a divorce.
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
I want a divorce.
Yeah, well, I'm in the middle of something.
Okay, you take care of that.
I'll have my lawyer call you.
This is about your investigator, isn't it?
My investigator?
Yes.
I would never think of divorcing you
unless I had some other man to call my own.
Come here.
I saw him yesterday,
walking around in his boxer shorts,
acting like he owned the place.
Yes, because I own the place,
and I told him he was welcome to walk around naked if he wants.
And Grace? Oh, you don't give a damn about your daughter.
Yes. I'm an unfit mother.
In the divorce,
you can get full custody for the three weeks
before she goes to college.
Well, this must be true love.
Again.
Is that what would upset you most?
If I was in love?
No, what upsets me the most is that you're shoving it in my face.
I'm not shoving anything.
This is me not caring.
Not caring what people think.
What Eli thinks. You think.
Or what the FBI thinks.
You know I'm about to be indicted, don't you?
Peter, you're always being indicted.
If it weren't today, it would be tomorrow.
I'll have my lawyer call.
Thanks.
You told Dr. Nachmann not to shoot a drone,
so he brought it down safely and he returned it.
Well, was the drone returned to Ms. Hamm in one piece?
It was, but...
Why are you bothering me with this?
He gave the drone back, it wasn't damaged.
Because it's against the law.
FAA rules prohibit interfering with
the operation of an aircraft midflight,
including by disabling it.
Your Honor...
18 U.S.C. 32 applies to airplanes and helicopters.
Not unmanned drones.
Actually, the law applies to any aircraft in the
special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States.
And are drones
in the special aircraft division of the United States?
No!
Yes.
Drones must be registered with the FAA.
But whether that puts them
within FAA jurisdiction would depend on
the height at which the drone was flying.
And the FAA's draft regulation on drones
is unclear on this issue.
Oh, well, then perhaps we should
talk to someone from the FAA.
If Peter sent you...
He didn't.
Well, what do you need?
Can I talk to you?
Privately?
Uh, certainly.
I need a lawyer.
You do? Or Peter does?
Peter has Mike Tascioni.
And this may be an instance where...
my interests and the governor's... diverge.
Understood.
So everything I'm about to say
will be covered under attorney-client privilege?
And you can't share this with Alicia.
I understand.
The Federal prosecutor, Connor Fox,
is trying to force me to testify against Peter at trial.
Okay, well, if or when you're subpoenaed,
you can obviously take the Fifth.
I'm not worried about incriminating myself,
I don't know anything.
But the AUSA doesn't believe that.
No.
Well, if you truly don't know anything,
why don't you just get up there and say that?
Here's the problem.
I... told my daughter something that I did
that may have...
obstructed justice.
And he's going to force Marissa to testify against you
if you don't help him take down Peter.
So what do I do?
What's up?
I'm hiding.
From who?
David Lee.
He dumped a 50-state survey on me.
Oh, yeah.
He likes to haze newcomers.
Mm, it felt like more than that.
He's probably feeling threatened.
Diane's...
Diane's been aggressive about this female-led firm idea.
Are we taking over?
I don't know.
I don't know if I have the stomach for a gender war right now.
Would we make more money?
Probably.
Come on in.
I need your help with something.
Funny thing.
I need yours. You start.
David Lee is hazing Lucca. He's got her doing
a pointless 50-state survey to complete overnight.
Yeah, he did that to me when I started. You, too.
Yes, but Lucca was my partner.
And when you convinced me to come back,
I convinced her.
Okay. Now I have a favor to ask you....
Sure.
Don't side with Diane.
With what?
You know with what.
Cary...
I'm not a name partner.
But you're a name.
This is none of my business.
It's between you and Diane.
And you can't take sides?
Okay.
Good to know.
So... you'll help Lucca?
I'll see.
You work for the Federal Aviation Administration, Mr. Ortiz?
I do-- the Enforcement and Compliance Division.
So you're familiar with the FAA's
proposed regulation on drones?
It's pretty much all we're talking about internally these days.
Could you explain for us what Class G airspace is?
It's the band that the FAA doesn't control.
It's between zero and 500 feet,
not including approaches to airports.
And above 500 feet, it would be illegal
to disable a drone aircraft,
for example, by using a device such as the Drone Dropper?
That is correct.
But below 500 feet,
that is not the FAA's jurisdiction?
Your Honor, point of information?
Regarding?
United States v. Causby.
That's C-A-U-S-B-Y,
not... the other way.
Thank you.
Uh, that case established
that an individual's property rights include
at least as much of the airspace above the ground
as one could occupy or use in connection with the land.
Do we have a number?
83 feet.
Exactly 83 feet?
That was the height below which the Court found
an airplane flying over Mr. Causby's land would frighten his chickens.
Of course.
My client's drone was
at 200 feet and therefore not on Dr. Nachmann's property.
Your Honor, this is preposterous.
That's a 70-year-old case.
But still good law.
But it's hardly applicable to what
we've seen is cutting-edge technology.
The law's the law.
Well, as far as the FAA is concerned,
if a drone is flying at 83 feet or below,
Dr. Nachmann would be within his rights to take it down.
And above 500 feet, it would be illegal.
And at 200 feet?
Well, it's not clearly his property at that point,
but it's not clearly... not.
As a representative of the FAA's legal department,
would you like to clear that up?
No.
Well, we're waiting to hear from the public and private sectors before
we regulate Class G airspace.
So for the time being...
Between 83 and 500 feet, it's the Wild, Wild West.
I hired an attorney. A good one.
Glad you passed on all the bad ones, but what's the plan?
Developing.
It sounds like you're putting me off.
Don't worry about me.
I'm worried about me, too.
I'm a small person, and it would be a lot of guilt
to carry around, putting you away.
All you have to do is hold tight and do not speak to AUSA fox.
Dad, do you not want to testify
against Peter Florrick because you don't think
he did anything wrong or are you still trying to protect him?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
David!
It's as if you're,
as if you are the only person on the letterhead.
I don't know, Diane. We... oh...
It's getting really creepy around here.
All right.
David, just calm down! I'll tell you...
We all have the same long-term goals.
World domination.
To turn this into the premier full-service law firm in Chicago.
You mean the premier female-led law firm.
Listen, we're not gonna ride into the future on Howard Lyman's back.
I don't care about Howard, but your elevation
of Alicia Florrick...
Makes sense.
She's been back here for barely a minute
and you have her stepping over bodies.
Alicia's name is a big draw to clients.
You didn't even want her.
I was shortsighted.
Or I was.
Alicia has weathered a lot of challenges--
Peter's, her own-- but she could still be an asset
to this firm, and that matters to all of us.
Oh, cut the crap!
What's your move?
Make Alicia a name partner.
No.
I can bring this to the entire partnership.
You think you have the votes?
I think I can get them.
Do you really want to tear this firm apart to find out?
So, uh... I don't get my office back, huh?
Not any time soon.
And there's no way to stop the estrogen army?
Not without a big fight.
Which you don't want to have.
I'm just not sure it's worth it.
Well, I will see you
on the 27th floor, pal.
Oh, I'm not giving up.
I'm just saying there's other things to consider.
Like what?
Money.
Howard, at the end of the day,
all I want to do is milk this place for all it's worth
while it's still standing.
I've reconsidered.
You're right.
A rising tide lifts all boats.
I'll support Alicia's elevation to name partner.
On what condition?
One that I think you'll be happy to comply with.
Hello?
Did you eat?
No.
You want something?
No.
What we have here is a political hot potato
masquerading as a legal case.
The law has simply not caught up with technology,
and drones remain-- and I would suggest frighteningly--
unregulated.
But because any regulation would require hard choices
between the competing values of privacy, individual liberty,
and commerce, neither the legislative
or the executive branch of the United States
want to make a decision, so it falls to me.
I'm not thrilled to say this, but...
drones are not on private property above 83 feet.
And you, Dr. Nachmann,
owe the plaintiff punitive and compensatory damages. That's it.
Well fought.
Thank you.
Your husband is a lawyer, too, right?
Yes.
How does that work?
Not well.
We're separated.
Oh, my God. I'm...
I'm so sorry.
Yes.
He's in Las Vegas.
It's just Zoe and me.
I guess you were right.
I never should've left.
No.
I wasn't right.
You threw in with Diane.
I'll call you back.
It's just what's best for the firm.
Isn't that what you told me when I got sent downstairs?
You let Diane and Alicia take over and what?
They slip you a few extra shares to shut up and smile?
Something like that.
Life's a bitch, kid.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Fox.
Diane Lockhart. I'm representing Eli Gold.
What can I do for you?
My client is here to confess to obstruction of justice
in the Don Schakowsky bribery case.
You realize that potentially comes with it a...
lengthy prison term.
I do.
Given Mr. Gold's willingness to cooperate,
his daughter Marissa should be of no further interest to you.
Of course, if you wish to pursue these charges,
Mr. Gold won't be of much value as a witness in any future trials,
including, perhaps, Peter Florrick's.
Uh, my understanding was that your client doesn't know anything about
Governor Florrick's involvement in the Locke mistrial.
My memory on that point is... foggy.
I suppose it could be refreshed.
Only time will tell.
So, um, you tell us, Mr. Fox.
Would you like to hear Mr. Gold's confession?
Or would you rather wait and hear his testimony at trial?
Thank you.
For what?
For making me a name partner. It was a surprise.
Don't thank me. I voted against it.
Is that because of the conversation we had before?
No. Don't worry. David Lee voted for you.
He doesn't care anymore.
Cary... I'm on your side.
I know we've been at loggerheads before,
but I won't be working against you.
I know. Because I'm quitting.
What?
I'm having Diane buy me out.
She...
Why?
I don't like it anymore.
I like being a lawyer.
That can be fun. But this isn't.
I'm not good at it.
I'm not good at looking over my shoulder.
I don't want to be my dad.
Cary, you can't just quit.
Yeah, I can.
By the way, I was subpoenaed in your husband's case.
It's not good.
Can I come in?
I can't fight now, Peter.
I'm exhausted.
Then let me just talk.
I'm not here to argue you out of your divorce.
The kids are grown.
We live apart. Things have changed.
Good. Thanks.
But I do need to ask you a favor.
As you know, I'm being indicted.
But this time, I don't think it's a false alarm.
I need you to stand beside me during this.
You can proceed with the divorce.
Just get everything ready. I won't contest it.
But...
don't make it public until afterwards.
I can't have it look like you're leaving me because I'm guilty.
After that, we'll go our separate ways.
Live our lives.
See each other when the kids graduate.
But I need to ask you this one last favor.
