okay , i &apos;m gonna go start the car .
claire likes to win .
when she was 8 , a little girl scout friend of hers
bragged she could sell the most cookies .
damn if claire didn &apos;t walk the neighborhood
till she got blisters on her feet and won by ten boxes .
best part is
claire wasn &apos;t even a girl scout .
the choice is claire !

becky got into the university of oregon .
oh , congratulations !
any news , haley ?
uh , uh , no , not-- not yet ,
but , you know , super psyched !
this whole waiting @-@ to @-@ hear thing has been a nightmare
since the very first letter .
i &apos;m too nervous . i can &apos;t do it .
&quot; dear miss dunphy ,
we regret to inform you ... &quot;
what ? ! don &apos;t leave me hanging !
after that , i decided to only tell my parents good news .
i have one school left ,
and the only good news i &apos;ve gotten
is that my annoying neighbor becky
is moving back east to oregon .
manny , write this down .
i didn &apos;t bring a pen .
election day is america at its finest .
the people speak , and the government listens .
i don &apos;t know what they do in colombia .
no one does , and don &apos;t ask .
i mean , we know that voting &apos;s a privilege ,
but for my daughter to have her name on that ballot ,
it just means so much more--
you know what ? i think i &apos;m gonna vote later .
what ? where are you going ?
ah , the line is too long .
it &apos;s only three people ! and nobody has a gun !
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re claire ,
get used to it !
you know , i &apos;m not sure if that &apos;s tracking .
here , let me try one .
you don &apos;t have to be clairevoyant to know who to vote for .
vote dunphy for town council .
uh , uh , uh , claire dunphy .
uh , c @-@ caire &apos;s her first name .
i &apos;m sorry if that wasn &apos;t claire .
oh , my god . look at that . there &apos;s a trash can right there ,
and that guy just threw his paper on the sidewalk .
hey ! you in the yellow jacket .
pick it up and put it in the trash .
oh , my god . he did it .
yes , he did .
ooh , here . let me try one.i &apos;ll try ...
hey , dragon tattoo , no jaywalking !
oh , my gosh .
this is an instrument of power .
how could they not sell tacos ?
you know what we could do with this thing ?
cam , we could really make a difference .
we could be the voice of change .
ooh , i got it !
let &apos;s go yell at the dry cleaner that lost my shirt .
come on , gang .
today is the dunphys at their best .
i &apos;m from the &quot; weekly saver . &quot; mind if i ask you
a couple questions about the big election ?
not at all .
fire away .
who are you voting for today ?
claire dunphy .
finally . i &apos;ve been waiting for someone to say that name .
why ?
uh ... because i am claire dunphy .
oh , sorry . they moved me over from ad sales .
we take turns reporting .
how do you feel about your chances today ?
not as good as i did a few minutes ago .
no , she feels great .
um , her spirits are high . the whole family &apos;s high .
there &apos;s your headline .
phil , no .
uh , how about a photo of all of you ?
yeah . sure . yes .
mom , mom , mom . tag .
tag &apos;s still on .
oh , my goodness .
thank you .
that would have been a really awkward picture . okay .
no !
what is that ?
is that a tooth ?
ew !
awesome !
how old are you ? no !
do it again !
how does that even happen ?
it &apos;s a @-@ a fake tooth from an old ice @-@ skating injury .
it just fell out .
oh , my gosh . why today ? !
what about the ...
let &apos;s not overreact .
let &apos;s--let me see it .
okay . all right .
got it . thanks .
what happened back there ?
line was too long . i couldn &apos;t wait .
i &apos;ve seen you wait 45 minutes in line for sherbet !
well , i happen to like sherbet , okay ?
that place i take you
has the greatest sherbet on the west coast .
they got lime sherbet , they got coconut sherbet .
why are we talking about sherbet ?
he &apos;s clearly changing the subject .
why aren &apos;t you in school ?
he &apos;s doing it again .
manny &apos;s right . you &apos;re being very ardilla .
&quot; ardilla &quot; ?
yeah , you know , the--
the one that--that--
rabbit ? i was being rabbit @-@ y ?
no , another one
with the cheeks and the tail and ...
chipmunk ?
possum ?
okay , obviously she means squirrel .
you were being squirrely then ,
you &apos;re being squirrely now .
better than being a rat .
manny , give us a minute .
oh , sure . i served him up on a silver platter .
what ?
all right , it &apos;s no big deal .
there was a woman working there .
i didn &apos;t want her to see me .
who is she ?
her name is dottie .
she &apos;s the first woman i dated after my divorce .
you dated a dottie after dede ?
y @-@ you &apos;re focusing on the wrong thing here .
the--the point is it ended badly .
i tried to let her down easy , but , uh ,
she didn &apos;t take it too well .
actually , i don &apos;t know how she took it ,
&apos;cause i wasn &apos;t there .
we dated a few weeks , then after we ... you know ,
i slipped out of her house before she woke up
and never called her again .
put my pants on in her yard , put the car in neutral ,
let it roll down the driveway , lights off .
hey , i can &apos;t talk about this anymore .
so because of this woman ,
you didn &apos;t vote for your daughter ?
it &apos;s claire ! we need her to win !
i don &apos;t want to be around when something that tight comes unraveled .
i &apos;ll figure out something .
maybe those poll workers take shifts .
stop hiding in your little cave like a--
like , you know . like the-- the--the--
i really don &apos;t wanna do this again .
no , the--
no . no . the big one , like , uh , the monster furry one .
ay , why can &apos;t i remember any animal names ?
climb aboard the dunphy express .
next stop--democracy .
well--no , no ...
please don &apos;t go .
i won &apos;t do that anymore . i promise .
oh . uh , we need to make a quick stop .
i gotta pick up my new glasses .
no can do . i , uh ...
i got a lot of people waitin &apos; , so ...
it &apos;ll just take two minutes .
i can &apos;t even see the ballot without my glasses .
i mark the wrong box ,
next thing you know i &apos;ll be married to a guy .
yeah , i-- i don &apos;t think it &apos;s mandatory , walt .
i &apos;m a good dancer . they &apos;ll come for me .
oh , yeah .
they will break all your buttons ...
and say you brought it in that way .
okay , go , go , go !
turns out we had a lot of axes to grind .
and a hybrid , so there was virtually no stopping us .
do not see that movie !
you will neither laugh nor cry !
&quot; best pizza in the city &quot; ?
not even the best pizza on this street .
they do not do the hair of the people on those pictures !
&quot; totally free checking &quot; ?
don &apos;t bank on it !
okay , that was really fun ,
but now we gotta go back to campaigning for claire .
we &apos;ve been saying that for two hours .
yes , but now i @-@ i really mean it .
oh , my god , there &apos;s sandy !
sandra bullock ?
yeah , sandra bullock .
we &apos;re such good friends , i call her &quot; sandy , &quot; so ...
no , sandy who works at lily &apos;s preschool .
right there .
oh , yeah .
you know , she got engaged .
no !
to the gay boyfriend ?
totally .
oh , how does she not see it ?
if i was with somebody that gorgeous ,
i &apos;d overlook a few quirks , too .
first of all , thank you .
second of all ...
point well taken .
i don &apos;t know . poor sandy . i feel so bad for her .
well , it &apos;s better than being alone .
is it ?
she &apos;s looking over here .
oh , my god .
mitchell , you &apos;re sitting on the button .
what ? no--no , i &apos;m not . no , i &apos;m not !
the--it &apos;s stuck !
and you &apos;re the one that had it last
when you were talking to the cheese shop !
because you know what ?
if you advertise truffle cheese ,
there are certain expectations ...
hi , sandy .
yeah , i &apos;m calling on behalf of claire dunphy .
what a beautiful name .
she used to be a citizen .
i &apos;m calling on behalf of claire dunphy for town council .
all right . how about this ?
if you vote for claire dunphy ...
you won &apos;t have to pay taxes for the rest of your life .
vote for claire !
luke ! what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t say that !
oh , like she &apos;d be the first politician
to make a promise she can &apos;t keep .
well , maybe i don &apos;t want to talk to you , either .
maybe you are the one that is bothering me !
how do you like that ? eh ?
gloria , i &apos;m gonna have to ask you again
to please stick to your script .
but everybody &apos;s saying no to me !
i don &apos;t get it .
usually when i ask someone to do something ,
they just do it !
maybe it &apos;s because these people can &apos;t see you .
i don &apos;t like it .
can &apos;t you just hook me up to some sort of camera ?
well , thank you , maggie , for the vote .
okay . bye @-@ bye .
here &apos;s your seat .
thank you . um , you &apos;ll have to excuse me .
i &apos;m a little nervous . i &apos;ve never been on the radio before .
don &apos;t worry about it .
just think of it as a conversation .
okay .
here are your headphones . volume control .
don &apos;t get too far from the mike .
okay .
make sure your cell phone &apos;s off .
oh . cell phone . right . um ...
and you &apos;re not chewing gum , are you ?
no , i &apos;m not . i just had some temporary
dental work done .
the last thing i need--
and welcome back to &quot; a matter of record . &quot;
i &apos;m cecil van gundy .
joining us now in studio is district 43
town council candidate claire dunphy .
thank you , cecil .
it &apos;s a pleasure to be here .
so ... you &apos;re a first @-@ time candidate .
tell us what got you involved .
it all started with a , um ...
with a stop sign .
i was concerned about safety in our neighbourhood
and i was not getting any satisfaction from city hall .
what &apos;s wrong with mom ?
oh , this isn &apos;t good .
she sounds drunk !
that &apos;s not her drunk voice .
tell us about some of the other issues facing our town .
where do you stand on the city &apos;s
sewage and sustainability initiative ,
the so @-@ called s.s.i. ?
one cannot really talk about
s @-@ s @-@ sewage and sustainability
without first discussing ... recycling .
this city can do more ...
what the hell &apos;s wrong with her ?
with the recycling program ...
she sounds drunk !
... currently ...
it &apos;s a tooth thing .
what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , i &apos;m almost out of air . oh , boy .
is that serious ?
is oxygen serious ?
you know what ? i lost a ton of time getting your glasses .
i &apos;m just gonna drop you at home .
you can get your air . i can drive other people .
i don &apos;t have any more tanks at home .
why ? that seems like bad planning .
well , i forgot to order them .
my pills make me forget things .
oh , shoot ! i gotta take my pill !
please tell me you have it with you .
of course i do , but i have to take &apos; em with food .
don &apos;t i ?
are you asking me ?
uh , yes ! i do take them with food !
ooh . i don &apos;t feel so well .
okay , i &apos;ll get you whatever you want !
i &apos;ll get you the air , i &apos;ll get you the food .
then i &apos;ll vote for your drunk wife .
that is not her drunk voice !
thank you so much for voting .
we appreciate it .
hi . i &apos;m terribly sorry . excuse me . jay pritchett .
uh , can i get in-- in and out really quick ?
thank you . this is all i needed .
thank you very much . thank you very much .
all right . claire , claire , claire .
claire , claire-- ahh , ahh . here .
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry !
hello , dottie !
jay ! it &apos;s so nice to see you !
is it ?
oh , why wouldn &apos;t it be ?
that was a long time ago . water under the bridge .
we &apos;re good .
oh , that &apos;s great .
thank you so much for voting .
you remember my daughter claire . she &apos;s--
she &apos;s running for town council .
oh , isn &apos;t that neat ?
yeah , i &apos;m so proud .
so you &apos;re gonna put it in there , huh ?
oh , yeah , of course . yeah . definitely .
cause every vote counts , you know .
thank you so much for voting .
you know ...
yeah .
boy , i &apos;d sure like to see the sweet sight
of my vote ... counting .
why would i say i &apos;d do something and not do it ?
that would make me a liar ...
instead of a trusting widow
who fell asleep in the warm embrace
of a man who promised to make breakfast .
okay , here it is .
look , i am so sorry .
you were the first woman i &apos;d been with besides my ex--
35 years .
i panicked .
an @-@ and it wasn &apos;t &apos; cause y @-@ you weren &apos;t pretty naked
or anything like that .
i &apos;d have run from angie dickinson .
oh , lucky her .
dottie--
good @-@ bye , jay !
dottie , dottie , please .
i &apos;m just trying to get my ballot in the box .
oh , yeah , that sounds familiar .
yeah , but you don &apos;t have to do anything .
just let me put it in !
uhh . shouldn &apos;t have said that .
we are so sorry .
we did not mean for you to hear any of that .
yes , and you know what ?
we shouldn &apos;t have been gossiping in the first place .
but what if you &apos;re right ?
what if gregory is gay ?
when my mom said it , i didn &apos;t believe her .
she lives in iowa .
but coming from you two !
means nothing .
no .
we barely know your fiance .
if he says he &apos;s straight , he &apos;s straight .
mm . straight .
we &apos;re getting married in a month .
people are flying in .
he signed us up for dance classes .
oh , my god !
no . no , no , no . hey .
this is what gays do .
yeah .
we gossip .
we gossip a lot .
he gossips !
no . no . you &apos;re missing the point , okay ?
we see a great @-@ looking guy like gregory ,
and we say he &apos;s gay because we want him to be gay !
really ? really ? are you sure ?
yes . yes .
absolutely . look at what we do with movie stars .
okay .
you know ? hugh jackman-- he sings , he dances ,
he &apos;s dreamy !
so obviously we would want him on our team !
yeah .
but he &apos;s straight .
trust me , i know .
i said hello to him once in a restaurant ,
and there was absolutely no chemistry .
well , if that isn &apos;t proof ...
three weeks later , sandy and gregory got married ,
and everyone said the wedding was beautiful .
gregory did the flowers ....
which is perfectly normal for a straight guy .
the greeks do one thing right , and it &apos;s lamb !
all right . let &apos;s go vote .
why the hell does your wife want to be a politician , anyway ?
you heard her . she wanted to put up
a stop sign at bristol and greenleaf ,
but then she ran into--
wait , wait , wait !
that &apos;s near where i live !
yeah . we &apos;re neighbors . let &apos;s go !
no way i &apos;m voting for that !
too much government already .
i didn &apos;t fight a war so some politician
could tell me where i have to stop my car .
you don &apos;t even drive !
that &apos;s &apos; cause that barack obama took my license away .
i don &apos;t think he was involved in the decision !
i left the house today to get 50 votes for my wife .
i &apos;m not going home with zero .
the least you can do is walk right in there
and punch a hole for the woman
who drags your garbage can up your driveway every tuesday !
i don &apos;t like it ! goes against everything i believe in .
really ? a stop sign ? !
but i &apos;ll do it , &apos; cause you &apos;re a good kid .
and i had a nice day ...
till you started yelling at me .
so sorry . thank you .
here you go .
you know , my wife was an alcoholic , too .
okay . let &apos;s just go vote .
that &apos;s veteran political reporter
walter shapiro .
hi , everyone !
any news ?
not yet , not yet ,
but even if i lose , at least now i know
i have a future in radio .
i couldn &apos;t . people need to see me .
before we get the results , i just want to thank you all
for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
mitch and cam , for campaigning for me all day
in your little claire @-@ mobile .
it &apos;s the least we could do .
yeah .
literally .
we probably did more for hugh jackman &apos;s career
than we did for claire &apos;s .
and , manny and gloria ,
thank you for making all those phone calls .
and , dad ...
for all your support .
i don &apos;t think i convinced anyone to vote for claire .
i don &apos;t think i even voted .
and my husband ...
who drove around
i don &apos;t know how many senior citizens today to the polls .
one .
and my beautiful children ,
whose faith has given me the confidence
to believe that i can do this .
i can--oh .
somebody else answer it . i lost .
mom . mom .
i can feel it . i--
mom .
you can do it . mom . answer the phone .
hello ?
this is she .
thanks so much for calling .
bye @-@ bye .
i have some bad news .
because someone &apos;s gonna be busy now that she &apos;s a councilwoman ?
no , no , i wasn &apos;t doing that fake thing .
i really lost . i lost .
ay , no .
i &apos;m so sorry . but you know what ?
we are still just so proud of you .
&#91; 哀悼克莱尔 &#93;
yeah ! i-- i don &apos;t know about you ,
but , um ... i could use a glass of wine .
ohh . now you &apos;re gonna hear her drunk voice .
mom ?
you okay ?
yes . fine . i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m not fine . i wanted to win ,
and ... and i &apos;m so embarrassed .
i mean , everybody out here worked so hard for me ,
and they believed in me ,
and i let &apos; em down .
oh , honey .
oh , sweetheart .
well , don &apos;t cry . i &apos;m gonna be fine , sweetie .
really , i am .
just knowing you care so much makes me feel better .
no , i got four rejection letters
i never told you guys about .
what ?
i got rejected from u.c.s.b. , oregon , wisconsin ...
oh , no .
and northwestern .
well , we were overshooting on that one .
what about , uh ...
it came today . my last chance .
i &apos;m too scared to open it .
whatever it says in there ,
your father and i are crazy proud of you .
okay ?
i did start trying this year .
i know you did . you did .
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
neither do you .
it &apos;s a little bit different .
no , it &apos;s exactly the same .
except you tried really hard the whole time ,
not just at the end .
you &apos;re right .
it is the same .
we have nothing to be ashamed of ...
so let &apos;s open that together .
yeah , open it .
what ? no ! what are you doing here ?
no . come on , haley . we believe in you .
do it !
you can always work for me .
come on . you can do it . you can do this .
come on , haley .
all right .
open . open , open , open .
&quot; dear miss dunphy ,
we regret to inform you ... &quot;
oh , honey .
&quot; while we cannot offer you admission at this time ,
&quot; you are a promising candidate , and therefore
we would like to place you on our wait list ! &quot;
oh , my god , i got wait @-@ listed !
we will take it !
yeah !
congratulations ! congratulations !
our daughter might be going to college !
phil , look .
a stop sign .
it &apos;s addressed to you .
&quot; dear claire , i won . you lost .
&quot; here &apos;s your stupid stop sign .
&quot; next time you think about bothering me ,
&quot; please take its advice .
your councilman , the honorable duane bailey . &quot;
honey , you did it !
i did it .
i made our neighborhood a little bit safer .
i may have even saved life .
you idiot , there &apos;s stop sign ! can &apos;t you read ?
we need speed bumps .
