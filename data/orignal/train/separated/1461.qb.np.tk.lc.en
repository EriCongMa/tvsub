i &apos;m fine . thanks for waiting .
what was that ?
water either gas line , the training is the same .
people , just stay low and move out .
honey , luke &apos;s gone .
claire , spontaneous human combustion is very rare .
i don &apos;t think he exploded , phil .
the rope ladder works . at least someone followed protocol .
oh ! oh , it &apos;s there !
smoke is coming out of luke &apos;s stupid suitcase .
like his old man , luke is a magician .
i &apos;m taking lessons from some guy my dad found online .
he came personally recommended from the guy who runs
the warlock conference up in modesto .
ocupad , big guy .
find another foxhole .
* this is how we learn to sing *
* who can go up here with me ? *
cam took a job teaching music at the local middle school .
yeah , his first day is tomorrow .
i &apos;m excited for me ,
but i &apos;m probably more excited for the students
because a great teacher is a gift .
hasn &apos;t started yet .
i have to tip my hat to my high school music teacher ...
a real force of nature
who was also the defensive coordinator for the football team
and supervised calf birthing for the animal husbandry club .
doris olson . great lady .
lady .
* this is how ... we learn to sing *
ay , jay , i &apos;m going to miss you .
it &apos;s one night .
no , i don &apos;t want to be without you ,
not even one night in my whole life .
what can i make you ?
how about a little room on my side of the bed ?
i mean , i shouldn &apos;t complain . my wife &apos;s a knockout . but ...
she &apos;s at that place in her pregnancy
where , she &apos;s , you know ... ample .
and the snoring .
i swear in the last ultrasound , the baby was like this ...
so i should be home about noon tomorrow .
who drank all the coffee ?
oh , i , uh , i had quite a bit of that .
you know , i haven &apos;t , um , been sleeping too well .
there &apos;s actually a funny story about what &apos;s causing that .
mom , i &apos;m fully aware of the changes your body is going through ,
and that nasal stuffiness is very common during pregnancy ,
but we got a crisis in this house .
you &apos;ve been snoring . but i got you these nasal strips .
in the commercial ,
the old man &apos;s angry red sound waves turn a gentle blue .
so i &apos;m like an old man ?
no !
like a dog then ? a pig ?
what is it , manny ? i &apos;m an old man , a dog , or a pig ?
jay , help me out here . you &apos;ve heard it .
i don &apos;t know what the boy &apos;s talking about .
if this is a glimpse of teenage manny , i don &apos;t love it .
have a little respect for your beautiful mother .
thank you , jay .
you &apos;re right . sorry , mom .
and , jay ,
have a great trip to san francisco .
okay , lily &apos;s drop @-@ off time is between 8 : 45 and 8 : 50,
so you should be fine to get work by 9 .
here is her checklist for her backpack .
oh , i have this whole thing planned .
okay , i &apos;m gonna walk in , take off my jacket ,
and say , &quot; here comes treble . &quot;
big swing on the first day .
please don &apos;t tamp down my enthusiasm .
okay , what else ?
oh ! the dimmer came in for the switch ,
so i want you to call the electrician , but not brad .
remember ? we had a problem with him last time about the billing .
he wanted his name above the title ?
yes , you &apos;ve done that joke before . so cute . so funny .
what else ? oh !
lily needs to get a present for gio &apos;s birthday party .
and don &apos;t be thrown by the invitation .
it is a pirates party , not a pilates party .
now sit . i wanna talk juice boxes .
cam . cam , i know what &apos;s happening here .
you &apos;re feeling very anxious about your first day at work ,
and you &apos;re focusing that anxiety on my day with lily .
really ? are you sure i &apos;m not
completely confident about my first day
because it &apos;s gonna be a home run .
and i am worried about you because you &apos;re taking on
a little bit more of the lily load ?
don &apos;t be scared , sweetie . mwah !
she &apos;s not scared ! what are you doing ?
just call me if you need me .
i won &apos;t !
and thank you for managing my expectations today .
not necessary .
i saw you practicing a bow last night .
that was just in fun .
you know , i highly doubt some teenagers are gonna
throw rose petals at my feet .
but i wouldn &apos;t be surprised
if i got slow @-@ clapped out of my first class .
wrong .
i am thinking .
if you were thinking ,
you wouldn &apos;t have seattle as the capital of washington .
it &apos;s spokane .
sure , which makes the 11th president of the united states
&quot; james k . pslk . &quot;
okay , alex , stop .
i &apos;m trying to figure this out .
buzz . time &apos;s up , dummy . it &apos;s olympia .
make sure you sound out the big scary words .
mom , something &apos;s on my mind , and it &apos;s really bothering me .
yeah , it &apos;s really bothering me , too ,
but i think it &apos;s gonna be rich ,
so we better be nice to it .
i wanna quit magic .
what ?
i &apos;m not really interested anymore ,
but i don &apos;t think dad &apos;s gonna be happy .
oh , sweetheart . don &apos;t worry about disappointing your father .
he only wants you to do it if you wanna do it .
tell you what . i will talk to dad--
whoa ! talk to dad ? that sounds serious .
don &apos;t do drugs .
stay in school .
luke wants to quit magic .
that &apos;s not happening .
well , see you guys at dinner .
sweetheart , don &apos;t you even want to talk about this ?
what &apos;s to talk about ? the kid &apos;s a natural .
he has everything--
the hands , the patter , the outfits .
okay , let &apos;s play this out .
even if he is one in a million ,
what &apos;s our best case scenario here ?
he becomes , what ...
a professional magician !
honey , the boy has a gift .
you wanna just throw that away ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s about throwing it away .
i think it &apos;s about you pushing him--
don &apos;t i get a say in any of this ?
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t like magic as much as you ,
but i don &apos;t .
this isn &apos;t about magic .
no , it &apos;s about my life and you controlling it .
look , you made a commitment . you will honor that commitment .
ugh ! i hate it here !
luke !
all right , young ladies and gentlemen ,
if i can have your attention , please .
let &apos;s settle down
and let &apos;s say a temporary good @-@ bye to your neighbor
and to life as you know it , because here comes treble .
that &apos;s right , my friends , we got treble ,
right here at franklin middle .
i &apos;m cameron t. , and that rhymes with &quot; g , &quot;
and that stands for &quot; good morning &quot; !
huh ? yes ! love the enthusiasm .
go ahead . first question .
when &apos;s mr. namagachi coming back ?
okay , mr. namagachi isn &apos;t coming back ,
but there is somebody that i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
don &apos;t know that you proy met .
she &apos;s a good friend of mine ,
and she goes by the name of &quot; music . &quot;
and sometimes my friend music can be shy .
sometimes she can be angry !
sometimes she can be playful .
and sometimes she can be downright a @-@ funky !
train wreck .
there &apos;s no way he ran this past mitchell .
daddy always parks in the back of the school .
i know , sweetie , but , uh ,
those spots were all taken .
because we &apos;re late ?
no , we &apos;re , like , a minute late , and that &apos;s &apos; cause of traffic .
and because i tipped over .
you didn &apos;t snap my car seat right .
okay , well , it certainly didn &apos;t hurt your memory any .
all right , here &apos;s your lunch .
you spilled it !
oh ! why is the top open ?
daddy always zips it for me .
maybe you should zip it .
i heard that .
so with just a few more minutes left--
mr. namagachi--
used to work here ,
but he got fired , okay ?
so now let &apos;s form an orchestra
made up of my favorite instruments--
your beautiful bodies .
gettin &apos; creepy .
okay , so you guys are gonna be my , uh , table slappers .
you &apos;re my bass line .
okay , and you &apos;re gonna be mouth trumpeters in the back with the melody .
okay , now let &apos;s bring it all together .
one , two , three .
the bass line is a little-- a little softer .
okay , louder with the mouth trumpets .
okay . great . well , thank you so much .
and , um , i thought it was a great first day .
and i love the give @-@ and @-@ take , everyone .
and , um ...
hey , dad . how &apos;s frisco ?
my meetings ended early .
i didn &apos;t even have to spend the night .
and don &apos;t say &quot; frisco . &quot;
they hate it when you call it &quot; frisco . &quot;
how do you know what they hate ?
you &apos;ve been there two times in your life .
anyway , i haven &apos;t slept in a week .
gloria &apos;s snoring like a water buffalo .
aw . well , she &apos;s pregnant . it &apos;s uncomfortable .
what , she put on 15 ? 20 ? 25 ? 30 ?
we &apos;re not doing this again . how do i bring it up ?
well , for starters , you don &apos;t .
you suck it up .
dad , your hot wife
who was learning to walk when you were 30 years old ,
is pregnant with a baby you conceived
doing something most men would kill to do .
i &apos;m just so tired .
it &apos;s a small sacrifice
compared to what she &apos;s going through . poor thing ,
what with the extra ... 30 ? 35 ? 40 ? 45 ?
we &apos;re done .
all right , here we go . how &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s not the kind we get .
okay .
hello ? hey , cam .
just checking in on me again ?
yeah . just wanted to see if you got lily .
yeah , we &apos;re--we &apos;re just-- we &apos;re at the grocery store ,
having a great time .
oh . yeah . any questions about the ...
about the grocery list ?
no , we &apos;re just picking up the granola .
so how was it ? how was the big debut ?
was it a comfortable ride around the schoolyard
on the shoulders of the children ?
well , i stood and delivered .
thank you for sarcastically asking .
yeah .
okay , did you call the electrician about the dimmer ?
yes . yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m on the other line with him right now .
oh , well , i should probably let you go .
keep your eye on lily . she has a tendency to wander off .
cam ... uh , wh @-@ wh--i &apos;m-- i &apos;m totally capable of ...
you lost her , didn &apos;t you ?
no . no , no , no , no .
no , she is right next to me . hi , honey .
i can hear it in your voice . look in the dairy case .
cam , do you honestly think that i would lose ...
the doors don &apos;t pull . they slide .
you never saw me .
thank you very much .
look , um , i thought about it ,
and if you really want to , you can quit magic .
you just have to do one thing first--
execute the butler &apos;s escape .
it goes without saying that the butler &apos;s escape
is one of the most challenging feats of escapology
an illusionist can perform .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s based , of course , on the well @-@ known story
of the earl of flanning &apos;s manservant percy ,
who was imprisoned in the tower of london ,
and as we all know , refused to take off his uniform
when he was shackled .
famously , as the , uh , tower guard gert slept ,
percy freed himself and leapt over the sleeping guard ,
giving rise to the popular expression ...
&quot; percy jumped the gert . &quot;
why are you making me do this stupid trick ?
i think you &apos;re quitting ...
because magic &apos;s getting hard ,
and that &apos;s not a good reason for quitting anything .
but ...
if you can do this ,
then i &apos;ll know that you genuinely don &apos;t like it ,
and you &apos;ll have my blessing to pursue other interests .
no strings attached .
sorry , buddy .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
you cannot really be enjoying that stupid show .
i was changing channels .
god . why are you so mean lately ?
is something wrong with you ?
is it that obvious ?
oh , my gosh . come on . you can talk to me .
there &apos;s this girl at school , and ...
she got pregnant .
no .
i know . i &apos;ve been trying to help her ,
but with all the pills she &apos;s taking , she kinda lashes out .
oh , honey , this is too much for you to take on alone .
where are the parents ?
they &apos;re no help .
dad &apos;s all consumed with his plastic surgery business ,
and her mom &apos;s an ex @-@ model who &apos;s trying to launch a music career .
you &apos;re describing the show i was just watching , right ?
i &apos;m just saying , mix in a book every now and then .
mean ! mean !
try to see this from my perspective .
i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m not raising a quitter .
trust me . i know what &apos;s best for you .
and watch your time . in the stage version ,
the rope &apos;s on fire , and you &apos;re suspended over a bed of nails .
i hate this ! why are you making me do this ?
use that anger , lukini .
let it be the key that opens the vault of fear ...
that holds the chalice of hope
that contains the elixir of success .
in a few short minutes ...
son of alkazeel ! you &apos;ve done it !
i quit .
so how was your first day ? tell me everything .
well , you know , it was a lovefest .
and the kids-- they were , you know , and ...
is that a roast ?
w--yes . yes . but i &apos;m surprised you could smell it over the
no @-@ dairy yellow pepper bisque with cheesy croutons .
oh , wow . you had time to do a roast and soup .
hi , daddy !
hi , angel !
how are you ? did you miss daddy ?
wow . bathed and braided .
yeah . let me just put you in a more flattering light here .
the dimmer .
who &apos;d you call ?
i called myself &apos; cause i did it .
yeah , i had time after picking up gio &apos;s present ,
so , uh ... go show daddy what it is .
okay .
yeah .
it sounds like you had a pretty successful day yourself .
well , it &apos;s just a matter of being organized .
but who am i telling , huh ?
you do this sort of stuff every day .
oh , blow on that .
so tell me more about the kids .
well , it was as i predicted , you know .
they just needed somebody to come in there
and bring music back to life .
and , you know , that person was ...
that person was ...
it &apos;s not me !
what &apos;s happening ?
it was a disaster , mitchell .
they hated me !
not just the kids , the teachers .
they wouldn &apos;t sit with me at lunch .
i had to sit alone .
oh , honey .
and my sweater--the shop teacher spilled juice on it .
he said it was an accident , but it wasn &apos;t an accident .
it &apos;s okay
it &apos;s not okay !
i failed miserably .
and look at you . you did everything so perfectly .
well , yes .
and--and--and no .
look , look , i ... i gotta tell ya .
uh ... i &apos;ve just been watching
how you &apos;ve done things all these years ,
and i just perfected it .
oh , please , mitchell !
claire ...
cam , he was every bit the failure you are .
he was late picking up lily . she was in with the custodians .
the only thing he had less to do with than dinner
was the dimmer .
and her hair was in braids because there was gum in it .
and ... why are we hugging ?
because i know if he called you for help
and heard as many insults as i know he had to hear ,
then he had a worse day than me .
oh , she was horrible , cam .
you know what ? it &apos;s gonna get better .
no , i know .
we just need some time to settle into these new roles .
you were right to lower my expectations .
i just wish i had lowered mine .
this gonna work its way around to a &quot; thank you , &quot; ladies ?
hey , honey .
surprise ! i &apos;m in san francisco !
what ?
i dropped manny at a friend &apos;s and , i know it &apos;s crazy ,
but i hopped on a plane and i &apos;m here !
i &apos;m driving to the hotel .
that is so great .
the thing is , honey , i &apos;m not here right now .
see , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m out at dinner .
probably won &apos;t be back for , um ...
oh , i don &apos;t know . a couple of hours .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll wait for you there .
don &apos;t be silly . how often do you get to san francisco ?
there &apos;s so much to see there .
i mean , here .
ghirardelli square ? fisherman &apos;s wharf ?
alcatraz ? hey , take that segway tour .
that &apos;s a great way to see the city .
and when you get the chowder ,
make sure it one of those bread bowls .
you can eat the bowl .
yeah , it &apos;s a story you &apos;ll tell for a lifetime .
you know what ? later on ...
maybe we can watch some of your lance burton dvds .
thanks . i think i just wanna try this escape .
would you mind tightening my arms ?
oh . sure . here .
it &apos;s just hard , you know ?
it &apos;s the first time he hasn &apos;t shared one of my interests .
it &apos;s scary to think that this is the start of us growing apart .
oh , honey , it &apos;s probably just a phase .
alex is going through something right now .
i wish i could figure that out .
i can &apos;t breathe .
anxiety .
no , no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m fighting the jacket .
the key to this escape is balance .
the whole thing is based on the idea of opposing forces .
holding each other in check .
that actually makes some sense .
some sense ?
there are two things i know with dead certainty--
how to shoulder roll out of a human pyramid ,
and the black arts of the butler &apos;s escape .
no , honey , our house is out of balance ,
because alex is missing her opposing force .
mm ? yeah .
oh . y @-@ you &apos;re missing out .
some people describe this escape as visual poetry .
honey ?
oh , no .
gloria .
you told me that you were in frisco ,
and you were here in a hotel ?
let me just say one thing .
don &apos;t say &quot; frisco . &quot; they hate that .
and how the hell did you find me ?
the house has been a little noisy lately .
and the school library is a pickup scene .
so where does a kid go for some peace and quiet ?
tell me right now if you &apos;re having an affair ,
and we will find some time later for me to kill you .
no . i &apos;m just trying to have one night away from your snoring .
you came to a hotel to sleep ?
i &apos;m exhausted , and i didn &apos;t want to hurt your feelings ,
but you &apos;re huge and you &apos;re loud .
it &apos;s like sleeping with rush limbaugh .
and i didn &apos;t want to bring it up because i figured
you &apos;d get mad at me the way you got mad at manny .
i am not mad at you because you told me that i snore .
i am mad at you because you didn &apos;t say anything .
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want to get yelled at .
well , too bad .
when you &apos;re married to me ,
you &apos;re going to get yelled at many times .
and you &apos;re tough enough to take it .
that &apos;s what i love about our marriage .
we can say whatever we want ,
but the next day , we &apos;re still there .
that &apos;s what i like about it , too .
what am i gonna say you couldn &apos;t forgive me ?
there are things , jay .
you ready to go ?
i was thinking , it &apos;s such a shame
that this hotel room is going to go to waste .
i like where this is headed .
make manny some pasta . i &apos;ll see you tomorrow morning , okay ?
hey , dad .
hey , buddy .
look , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry if i--
no no no , don &apos;t apologize .
there &apos;s still plenty of stuff we can do together .
so if you want out ,
you are ... out !
uh , i know we bought a lot of magic stuff ,
but we can return some of it--
merlin &apos;s hat , the gloves , most of the capes .
what about houdini &apos;s wands ?
they kinda got broken .
all three ? what happened ?
i got you carbon fiber .
some kids were messing around with them at school .
what do you mean ? what--what were they doing ?
i don &apos;t really want to talk about it .
you know , i went through that ,
kids--kids messing with my stuff .
really ?
oh , yeah . in high school ,
when i first got nominated for junior tumbling congress ,
my parents had to sign a ... release !
anyway , my buddy dizzy brindizzi
saw it , grabbed it , and made a lot of fun of me .
i thought about not going .
but you did .
oh , yeah . had a blast .
made a lot of friends ,
shared milkshakes with more than one female tumbler .
the minute i stopped caring what other people thought
and started doing what i wanted to do , is the minute
i finally felt ... free !
buddy ...
you &apos;re gonna make your own choices ,
and whatever you decide , i &apos;ll always support you .
you &apos;re not just saying all this &apos; cause you &apos;re stuck , right ?
nothing you decide will ever disappoint me .
thanks , dad .
relax your arms ,
roll your shoulders forward ,
bend down your head ,
exhale ...
and then arch .
uh ... it sorta worked .
well , honey , i just wanted to check in and say hi .
alex , come say hi to your sister !
i love you so much .
what &apos;s up , lady ?
oh , my god . you did not just say , &quot; what &apos;s up , lady ? &quot;
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i was just saying hello--
oh , it &apos;s like the lamest thing you &apos;ve ever said .
and what is that shirt ?
what are you , a flapper ?
i just bought it at that store that you--
oh , where ? forever 1921 ?
and what is going on with your hair ?
what &apos;s wrong with my hair ?
oh , you should just dip yourself in boy repellent .
shut up ! mom !
and balance ...
