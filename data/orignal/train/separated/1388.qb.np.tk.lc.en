come on , let &apos;s go .
we &apos;re gonna need a little more time
at the airport security because i &apos;m pretty sure
that they &apos;re gonna wanna patch you down .
manny is with his father for the weekend
so jay and i are flying to vegas .
i &apos;m a little torn because i want alone time with gloria ,
but i also like rubbing manny &apos;s head for good luck .
i just need to send this e @-@ mail to claire
why i &apos;m not working on the bake sale next week ,
but i can &apos;t say the real reason .
why not ?
because she drives me crazy
when she &apos;s in charge of these things .
okay . we got a flight to catch , so let me help you out here .
okay .
you tell me what you want to say to her ,
and i &apos;ll help you find a nice way to say it .
i want to say ...
i can &apos;t work on the bake sale
because you &apos;re a bossy control freak
that looks down on my cupcakes
even though your lemon squares were very dry .
done . okay ?
how &apos;s this ?
&quot; dear claire , i can &apos;t work the bake sale
because you &apos;re a bossy control freak who look down -- &quot;
very funny , jay .
i -- i -- why the whoosh ?
where is -- where is the e @-@ mail ?
it sended ! ay . make it come back .
i don &apos;t know how to make it come back .
now she &apos;s gonna read it ,
and she &apos;s gonna think it &apos;s from me !
well , technically , it was from you .
come on , let &apos;s hit the road .
it sended .
please come back .
we love our neighborhood , but sometimes the last thing
you want to do after fighting traffic
is get back in the car to go out to eat .
and the only restaurant within walking distance
is shawarma city .
two shawarma combo . meat or chicken ?
uh , one meat . one chicken .
and can you make the chicken all white meat ?
number 32 . pay cashier .
okay , that &apos;s not an answer .
then a miracle happened .
uh , the hottest new restaurant in the city
opened up two blocks away --
amelia &apos;s .
but there was a problem .
they can take us at 5 : 15 ...
what are we , 80 ?
10 : 45 .
what are we , 20 ?
then ... miracle number two .
turns out one of the mothers at lily &apos;s pre @-@ school
is none other than amelia herself .
so we arranged a play date with her son , jackson ,
where we would , you know , charm amelia .
okay .
the most important play date ever ,
so i &apos;m really gonna need you to sparkle , sweetie .
oh , i &apos;m gonna sparkle like it &apos;s the 4th of july .
i was talking to lily .
it &apos;s our parents &apos; anniversary ,
so we &apos;re surprising them with breakfast in bed .
they &apos;re impossible to buy for ...
we think .
we &apos;ve never really tried .
okay . ready ?
one , two , three ...
surpri @-@ i @-@ i--
oh . oh ! no ! no !
no ! no ! no !
i &apos;m sorry !
nothing &apos;s happening !
oh , my god .
yeah , our kids walked in on us .
we were , as they say , &quot; having sex . &quot;
oh , god .
that &apos;s not a euphemism , phil .
it &apos;s exactly what we were doing -- having sex .
in front of our children .
well , they weren &apos;t there when we started .
no .
in fact , you weren &apos;t even there when we sta ...
oh , my god . oh , my god .
it &apos;s okay . maybe they didn &apos;t see anything .
sweetie , t @-@ they screamed , they dropped a tray of dishes ,
and then they ran out of here like they were on fire .
you were on fire , lady .
really ? you &apos;re still going ?
well , forgive me for thinking
your zesty performance deserves some praise .
phil , our children are downstairs right now ,
and they are probably traumatized .
oh , come on . i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not that bad .
i can still see it !
i can &apos;t believe that just happened !
what were they doing ?
nothing !
whatever it was , it looked like dad was winning .
it ! they were doing it !
he has no idea what you &apos;re taking about .
sex ?
yes !
i know what sex is , alex .
it &apos;s when a man and a woman take off their underpants
and then get into the bed .
stop talking !
try claire again .
i &apos;m not getting a signal .
relax . we &apos;ll get her .
hey , shorty told me about this restaurant in vegas
that &apos;s got a three @-@ story wine tower
right in the middle of it .
the guy who gets your wine flies around on a wire .
like the &quot; peter pan . &quot;
no . not like the &quot; peter pan . &quot;
this is a high @-@ end place .
oh , yeah , because all the finest restaurants in the world
have people flying around on wires .
you know , you used to go bananas
when a japanese guy flipped a shrimp onto your plate .
now look at you .
try her again .
fine .
and just so you know , it &apos;s not like peter pan .
i mean , nobody wears tights or anything .
well , if they &apos;re not wearing anything ,
i don &apos;t want them flying over my food .
hello .
phil , it &apos;s me . can i talk to claire ?
yeah . one second , jay .
it &apos;s your dad .
no . no , no . can &apos;t . unh @-@ unh .
she doesn &apos;t want to talk right now .
ay , no .
why not ?
uh , she &apos;s a little too upset .
phil , put her on .
he says he wants to --
hang up the phone .
i &apos;m sorry , jay .
she says i have to go .
you know , she &apos;s my daughter and everything ,
but that guy seriously needs to grow a pair .
well , we tried .
vegas , here we come .
turn around the car .
only &apos; cause i want to .
this is a @-@ a beautiful home .
i love the throwback to the &apos; 60s .
although if this was the &apos; 60s ,
we &apos;d be a couple of &quot; confirmed bachelors , &quot;
and lily would be a yorkie .
and i &apos;d still be trapped in a loveless marriage .
oh , amelia .
oh , you are funny !
i really like you guys .
i mean , i haven &apos;t had a lot of time
to meet the other parents .
you know , single mom , hectic work schedule ...
now , what do you do , amelia ?
i own a few restaurants .
i just opened one nearby .
oh , my gosh . are you that amelia ?
oh , my gosh !
we &apos;ve heard wonderful things about the restaurant .
it must be doing well .
we can never seem to get a r -- a reservation .
can &apos;t get in .
can &apos;t .
oh , well , that &apos;s no problem .
the next time you call , just tell them --
oh . one second .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . tell them what ?
hello ?
well , did you show it to him ? and what did he say ?
okay . uh , hold on a second .
i &apos;m gonna switch phones .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s the restaurant .
excuse me just a minute .
you said to tell them something .
did you hear that ?
when we know what to say , we &apos;re in .
oh ! this is very exciting .
i &apos;ve never had an in at a restaurant before .
they &apos;ll probably greet us at the door by our names ,
show us to our favorite table ...
they &apos;ll let us play fast and loose with the menu ,
order lunch things for dinner , dinner things for lunch !
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
cameron !
it &apos;s fine .
stop moving .
you there ?
put him on the phone .
oh , that &apos;s the baby monitor . should we turn it off ?
who am i speaking to ?
well ... mr. campbell ,
you need to replace the extremely expensive countertop
that one of your incompetent workers clearly ruined
when he was supposed to be fixing the refrigerator .
okay , this is why she &apos;s so successful .
she &apos;s tough but calm .
because i &apos;m not an idiot ! !
as is evidenced by my law degree ,
which i will happily dust off and use to crush you in court
if you don &apos;t fix it , replace it ,
or send me a check in the next 72 hours .
you know what ? stay right there .
don &apos;t move .
act like you weren &apos;t listening .
what does that look like ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i have to run down to the restaurant for a minute .
i really feel terrible asking ,
but do -- would you guys mind --
oh , it &apos;s not a problem . we &apos;ll watch the kids .
okay .
oh , yes , you go take care
of that fabulous restaurant of yours
that we cannot wait to try .
and when we do call , amelia , you said to --
jackson , mommy will be right back .
okay . thanks , you guys , so much .
i owe you big time .
did you hear that ?
she owes us big time .
you know , she also has that restaurant in las vegas
where the sommeliers fly around on wires .
oh , my gosh . lily , thank you for being such a trouper
with mr. personality over there .
i &apos;m gonna get you a treat .
oh , a juice box broke in here . it &apos;s all wet inside .
will you stop gasping ? it &apos;s just a diaper --
okay . we need a game plan .
we need to rehearse exactly what we &apos;re gonna say
because that is the only way i &apos;m gonna hold it together
when my babies are looking at me
with judgment and disgust .
first of all , that &apos;s how they always look at us .
oh , phil .
secondly , this isn &apos;t as traumatic as you think .
honey , i walked in on my parents having sex once .
it was -- oh -- awful .
i can &apos;t even get the image out of my mind .
claire , we &apos;re not your parents . we &apos;re in much better shape .
okay . you want to know the worst thing ?
they didn &apos;t even talk about it .
they just let it hang there .
i &apos;m not gonna do that to our kids .
phil , this --
this is a defining moment for us as parents .
how we handle this could shape how they feel
about sex and intimacy for the rest of their lives !
claire . honey .
honey , this is only a big deal if we make it a big deal .
we set the tone here . so let &apos;s just play it cool .
act like it was a big , funny mix @-@ up .
crack a few jokes . lighten the mood .
jokes .
what kind of jokes ?
well , this is ...
i &apos;m just spitballin &apos; here , but --
what if i was all , &quot; knock , knock ... &quot;
and they were like , &quot; who &apos;s there &quot; ?
and i was all , &quot; someone who doesn &apos;t want to see
their parents doing it .
that &apos;s why we knocked . &quot;
again , this is -- this is very rough .
why are they still up there ?
how long does sex take ?
oh , my god . stop talking .
did you guys notice
that dad had the same look on his face
as when he smells a new car ?
i need to leave .
i need to go to camp .
this is gonna be so weird when they come down .
let &apos;s just go . okay ? come on .
wait . but i &apos;m hungry .
we &apos;ll get breakfast . let &apos;s just go . come on !
let &apos;s go . come on .
where are you going ?
anywhere .
where is your mother ? i need to talk to her .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good time right now .
she won &apos;t come out of her room .
she &apos;s really upset , isn &apos;t she ?
big time .
how &apos;d you know ?
we called .
tell me exactly what she said .
i don &apos;t know . there was just a lot of screaming .
where was your father when all this was going on ?
oh , he was right behind her .
oh ! it &apos;s not coming out ! it &apos;s not coming out !
blot ! don &apos;t rub ! blot !
we are beyond blotting and rubbing .
i think we &apos;ve moved on to sweating and crying .
okay , okay . let &apos;s not panic .
we &apos;ll just -- we &apos;ll tell amelia what happened ,
and then we &apos;ll pay to have it cleaned .
what if it can &apos;t be cleaned , mitchell ? !
okay , okay . then we &apos;ll pay for a new rug .
are you insane ?
this is a limited @-@ edition alpaca hand @-@ made stark rug !
i saw it in architectural digest .
it cost $ 50,000 . it was in diane keaton &apos;s house .
oh , no , it was in , oh , what &apos;s @-@ her @-@ name &apos;s house .
um , from &quot; prizzi &apos;s honor . &quot;
from -- uh , oh , oh , she was in &quot; addams family . &quot;
you know , she --
anjelica huston !
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
oh ! oh , my god . $ 50,000 for a rug ? !
cam , we don &apos;t have that kind of money .
maybe she won &apos;t make us pay .
i mean , we wouldn &apos;t make someone pay
if this happened to us .
did you not hear her on the phone ?
&quot; fix it . replace it . write me a check . &quot;
she probably has that embroidered on a pillow .
right next to a jar of human tears .
maybe we can turn this around .
how ? it looks like someone bled out over here .
no . i mean the rug .
maybe we can turn the whole rug around ,
put it under the couch .
see ? no one would ever know it &apos;s there .
well , you know , we would know .
well ...
what are you thinking ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
no , tell me , &apos; cause i &apos;m --
i think i &apos;m thinking the same thing .
i seriously doubt that ,
because now i &apos;m thinking it was joan collins &apos; house .
okay .
great .
gloria , what are you -- what are you doing here ?
wait , where are the kids ?
they just left .
they told me that you were very upset .
oh , god .
and you have every right to be .
it was bad .
i know that .
claire , it was an accident .
that doesn &apos;t make it any better .
okay , you &apos;re right . i know how you feel .
oh , god .
it happened to me before ,
with another woman .
and that time , i was the one getting it .
and it hurt .
i &apos;m sorry it had to come out like this ,
but you have to admit that you &apos;re only happy
when you &apos;re the one cracking the whip .
what ?
come on .
we all know how you ride phil .
but maybe if you just let go a little ,
maybe even taste my cupcakes ,
i will join you .
no -- unh @-@ unh . no . no .
i @-@ i am so confused right now .
i may pass out .
what are you talking about ?
what are you talking about ?
the kids just walked in on
me and phil i @-@ in bed .
and we &apos;ve just spent the last hour
holed up in our room
trying to figure out what to say to them .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
can i use your computer ? i just need to check one e @-@ mail .
yeah , the kitchen .
gloria , i just switched us to the next flight .
now , did you guys get everything straightened out ?
claire is very upset
because the kids just walk in on them having sex .
aw , geez .
oh , then we &apos;re all up to speed .
she &apos;s so upset that she hasn &apos;t even had time
to apply her make @-@ up or use her computer .
w @-@ what are you even doing here , dad ?
i don &apos;t think you should be the one
doing the questioning here , missy .
don &apos;t get mad at her .
your wife &apos;s the one who just offered up her cupcakes .
phil .
good thing we had mom &apos;s gas card .
don &apos;t make me regret buying you that lighter , dude .
put it down .
okay , i &apos;m just gonna say it .
our parents are totally irresponsible .
and i &apos;m not just talking about us walking in
on their ... little freak show earlier .
just let it go .
no . we &apos;re lucky to be alive .
how often do they let luke go -- go to school
in shorts in the winter ?
and they let me ride in the front seat
before i was 60 pounds .
and they never shut the gate
at the top of the stairs when we were babies .
do you know how many times you fell on your head ?
do you ?
no .
we get it -- it was bad .
but , you know , i --
i guess ...
it &apos;s better than having parents who fight all the time .
maybe .
my friend jacob &apos;s parents are getting divorced .
he has to move out of his house .
they told him last week .
that sucks .
he &apos;ll get used to it .
half of my friends &apos; parents are divorced .
mine too .
it &apos;s insane .
so it &apos;s a good thing mom and dad still do sex .
better than mom leaving the stove on ,
which she &apos;s done twice this month .
i just realized we haven &apos;t even gotten
to the worst part of it yet .
which is ?
they &apos;re gonna want to talk about it .
well , maybe not .
are you kidding ?
their parents never talked about anything ,
so they want to talk about everything .
yeah , they called a family meeting
when we switched to 1 % milk .
i don &apos;t know where those kids are .
what is more important
than putting a working lock on a bedroom door ?
you are one to talk .
what is that supposed to mean ?
you don &apos;t remember
when i walked in on you and mom that time ?
gloria , can we please go now ? !
so why don &apos;t you just get off your high horse , dad .
at least i am trying to handle this
better than the two of you did .
what did we do ?
you made gimlets and went back to your room .
what were we supposed to do ?
you -- you -- you could have talked to me .
you could have made sure that i was okay .
want to talk about it ?
yes . fine .
your mother and i were watching
a particularly racy episode of &quot; hart to hart . &quot;
stefanie powers had to go undercover as a call girl .
mnh @-@ mnh . dad .
hang on .
this whole story makes more sense
if you know i got a thing for thigh @-@ high boots .
oh , gross ! gross . you are ruining sex for me ,
and boots .
working okay for you ?
oh , yes .
i was sending an e @-@ mail to my brother in colombia .
um , i was telling him about claire .
you know , i realize there &apos;s so much i don &apos;t know about her .
like , for example , what is her favorite word ?
or what was her first pet &apos;s name ?
gloria , i &apos;m not an idiot .
are you trying to get claire &apos;s password ?
okay , fine .
i sent her something by mistake .
i need to get into claire &apos;s e @-@ mail
to erase it before she sees it .
before i see what ?
hola , claire .
hi , gloria .
before i see what ?
it &apos;s so embarrassing .
you see , jay and i --
it &apos;s a naked picture of gloria .
yes .
naked .
i was gonna send it to jay .
you see everything . the whole body .
i need to sit .
okay .
wow , dad .
so , you just got done giving me a lecture
on the importance of locking my bedroom door
while in my house to retrieve naked pictures
that your wife accidentally sent me .
the irony is just occurring to me .
what are you doing ?
what i &apos;m doing ... is deleting it .
good for you .
let &apos;s go to vegas !
ciao !
do us a favor -- no pictures .
oh , gloria , listen .
we do need to talk about the bake sale at some point .
i have some concerns .
of course you do .
yes .
all right !
what do we do now ?
okay , i &apos;m really afraid
of reading this situation the wrong way ,
but i &apos;m 80 % sure you &apos;re coming on to me .
okay , now ... 40 % .
mitchell , we need to make a decision .
it was the perfect plan .
turn the rug , and she wouldn &apos;t find the stain for years .
but we couldn &apos;t do it .
we &apos;re too honest .
there are certain moments in life that define you ,
and this is one of those moments .
oh , guys , i &apos;m so sorry that took so long .
oh , my god . what happened here ?
jackson did it .
he grabbed lily &apos;s strawberry juice and started drinking it .
what ?
before we could stop him , it was all over everything .
oh , my god . oh , my god !
we are horrible people .
i &apos;m only following your lead .
yeah , so close that you stepped on the back of my shoe .
come here . jackson &apos;s allergic to strawberries .
what ?
his throat will close up ,
and he can go into anaphylactic shock .
i need to inject him right now !
oh ! are you sure ? he seems all right to me .
yeah , maybe just get him some fresh air .
stop talking ! he really hates this .
and so i &apos;m gonna need you
to help me pin down his arms and his legs , okay ?
you know what ?
jackson , honey ,
mommy &apos;s so sorry to have to do this ,
amelia -- - but it &apos;s only gonna hurt for a second .
his arms ! !
okay . hurry . here we go .
one , two --
wait !
wait !
jackson didn &apos;t drink the juice !
i stepped on lily &apos;s bag and a juice box fell and we panicked
because we heard you on the phone
and we can &apos;t afford joan collins &apos; rug !
we are so , so sorry . we could not feel any worse .
oh , no . that &apos;s bad .
number 19 !
number 19 !
yeah . yeah .
oh , uh , can we have some napkins , please ?
all out of napkins .
paper towels in bathroom , mitchell .
he knows your name !
and , uh ... i &apos;m just gonna say it --
i &apos;m really sorry about what happened .
well , we &apos;re -- we &apos;re not sorry about what happened .
we &apos;re sorry that you saw what happened .
yeah , okay . they -- they get that .
let &apos;s see .
uh , no one wants to see their parents ...
your sensuality ...
... not dressed .
basically , it &apos;s two adults .
adults .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re shaking hands .
but you &apos;re not using your hands at all .
i can &apos;t handle a big family talk about this .
we &apos;re not gonna have a choice .
so when they start talking ,
just smile and nod and think about something else .
yeah , it &apos;s easy . just like at school .
so , i @-@ i guess what i &apos;m saying here
is that as you get older
and ... explore your sexuality , you will discover
that as long as you are in a committed relationship
with consenting adults ,
there &apos;s really nothing to be embarrassed about .
and let &apos;s face it -- your mom can &apos;t keep her hands off me
whenever the gun show comes to town .
good one , dad .
humor makes difficult situations easier !
wow . really ?
totally .
you talked to us on our level
but without being condescending !
we did .
all right .
i guess we did .
yay , us .
i think we really handled that well .
me too . you were excellent .
you were pretty good .
ugh , this is such a weird day .
i know it .
by the way ...
happy anniversary .
it always is .
hey mom , can i get --
oh , my god ! enough !
hey , what &apos;s this ?
your anniversary present .
that &apos;s very sweet .
my goodness .
what is it ?
a door lock .
how embarrassing .
thank you .
we &apos;ll use it all the time .
we thought the lock was a really good idea .
the problem is it makes a noise .
a loud noise .
