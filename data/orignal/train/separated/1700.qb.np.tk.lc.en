hey , you guys ready to order ?
uh , sure .
okay , priya ?
uh , i &apos;ll have the shepherd &apos;s pie .
you want to split that with me ?
oh , no , no , no , he doesn &apos;t .
why not ?
well , you have milk in the taters ,
milk in the gravy , parmesan crust .
your lactose @-@ intolerant boyfriend will turn
into a gas @-@ filled macy &apos;s day balloon .
not quite accurate .
the macy &apos;s balloons are filled with helium ,
whereas leonard produces copious amounts of methane .
so , no , on the shepherd &apos;s pie .
can we move on ?
yeah , a little tip : he says he can eat frozen yogurt .
do not believe it .
sea bass ! i &apos;ll have the sea bass !
you gotta like this ,
the girlfriend and the ex @-@ girlfriend bonding
over your rooty @-@ tooty stinky booty .
kill me .
it wouldn &apos;t help . the human body is capable
of being flatulent for hours after death .
guys , sorry i &apos;m late .
i have amazing news .
bernadette , before you change the subject ,
does anyone have any final comments on
leonard &apos;s faulty digestive system ?
so , what &apos;s your news , bernadette ?
the thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation .
i &apos;m getting my phd !
wow ! oh , congratulations .
wow , so that means you &apos;re a doctor , you &apos;re a doctor ,
you &apos;re a doctor , you &apos;re a doctor ,
and howard , you know a lot of doctors .
congratulations , honey .
thank you .
so , howard , tell us , how &apos;s it feel knowing
that when you two get married ,
you &apos;ll be referred to as mr. and dr. wolowitz ?
unless he takes bernadette &apos;s last name .
and considering her advanced status ,
that could open some doors for him .
please , this isn &apos;t about me .
i &apos;m proud of you .
well , you &apos;ll be really be proud of this .
i was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company .
they &apos;re gonna pay me a buttload of money !
what ?
bernadette , that &apos;s great .
howard , do you make a buttload ?
better than what you &apos;ve got a buttload of .
hey , if i roll down the windows in the car , everything &apos;s peachy .
if you do it , you &apos;re still not a doctor .
yeah , just a heads @-@ up on the car window deal .
it helps , but everything is not &quot; peachy . &quot;
* oh , if there was a problem , you can &apos;t solve it *
* check out the hook while my dj revolves it *
* ice , ice , baby *
* ice , ice , baby *
oh , god , i feel ridiculous in this dress .
you look beautiful , lieutenant uhura .
now prepare for ... inspection .
shh , my brother &apos;s going to hear you .
relax , he &apos;s got headphones on .
and we &apos;re ten miles above earth in a starship .
really , ten miles ?
you &apos;re orbiting inside the atmosphere ?
moron .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m wearing my brother &apos;s halloween costume .
i can &apos;t believe you think he only wears it on halloween .
open the landing bay doors , shuttle craft approaching .
okay , gotta go .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
is that my future daughter @-@ in @-@ law , the doctor ? !
no , ma ! it &apos;s raj !
he &apos;s a doctor too , right ? !
yes !
like leonard and the skinny weirdo !
sheldon , yes !
everybody &apos;s a doctor but me !
well , whose fault is that ? !
what &apos;s up ?
leonard &apos;s putting disgusting memories in
my memory foam mattress .
can i stay here tonight ?
sure , but i &apos;m going out with bernadette .
it &apos;ll just be you and my mother .
i guess that &apos;s okay .
ma , can rajesh sleep over ? !
of course , he and i can play doctor !
she &apos;s kidding , right ?
i don &apos;t know , she &apos;s pretty feisty since
they put her on hormone @-@ replacement therapy .
paging dr. cutie pie !
i must say , amy , i was very impressed
to see that bernadette got her phd .
it &apos;s indeed admirable .
although , it is ... microbiology .
your doctorate is in neurobiology .
i fail to see the distinction .
i &apos;ll make it simple for you .
i study the brain ,
the organ responsible for beethoven &apos;s &lt; i &gt; fifth symphony . &lt; / i &gt;
bernadette studies yeast ,
the organism responsible for michelob lite .
is there something wrong with your neck ?
it &apos;s a little stiff .
what a remarkably fragile structure
to support such a valuable payload .
not unlike balancing a faberge egg on a pixie stick .
have you considered massage ?
i &apos;d like to respond to that sarcastically :
yes , i relish the thought of a stranger covering my body
with oil and rubbing it .
i was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands .
still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching .
trust me .
with your right hand ,
locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process .
all right .
now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade ,
making a small rotation as you do so .
rotating .
you should feel a small node @-@ like object
rolling back and forth along the bone .
you mean the myofascial point ?
obviously .
now bear down on it
like the seventh grade noogies
we all know too well .
oh , dear lord , yes , yes , oh , yes !
amy , i &apos;ve never been touched like this before !
oh ! my hands are magic !
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge
of the nervous system .
i could just as easily have paralyzed you .
there &apos;s someone at my door .
that doesn &apos;t interest me . good @-@ bye .
can i sleep here tonight ?
why ?
leonard &apos;s having astronomically inaccurate
&lt; i &gt; star trek &lt; / i &gt; sex with my sister .
i can see how that would be upsetting . come in .
i &apos;ll get the sheets and blankets for the couch .
oh , don &apos;t bother . i &apos;ll just sleep in leonard &apos;s room .
no , i can &apos;t authorize that .
well , he &apos;s in my bed . why can &apos;t i be in his ?
the hammurabic code is &quot; an eye for an eye , &quot;
not &quot; a bed for a bed . &quot;
come on , dude , i &apos;m exhausted ,
and tyra banks says
the most important item in your makeup bag
is a good night &apos;s sleep .
all right .
this is a form indemnifying me
from your use of &quot; leonard &apos;s bedroom . &quot;
sign here , indicating that i tried to stop you
and did so using a stern facial expression .
good night , sheldon .
wait . not yet .
we still have to go over safety procedures .
now , the apartment has three emergency exits located
here , here , and here .
in the event of a power outage ,
luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit .
you &apos;re kidding .
i never kid about safety .
what are you doing here ?
i was sleeping .
in my bed ?
well , i would &apos;ve slept in my own bed ,
but it was being used to bring shame to my family .
and the memory of gene roddenberry .
oh , you heard ?
&quot; scotty , i need more power . &quot;
sorry . does sheldon know you &apos;re sleeping in here ?
are you kidding ? he made me sign a waiver ,
participate in an emergency fire drill
and take a refresher course in cpr .
thank god he had a dummy .
oh , yeah . mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth mona .
you know , she used to date howard ?
oh , my god , she &apos;s &lt; i &gt; that &lt; / i &gt; mona ?
why can &apos;t you and my sister spend your nights here ?
we tried . she doesn &apos;t get along with sheldon .
sheldon doesn &apos;t get along with sheldon .
it &apos;s still no reason for me to have to listen to you
arm your photon torpedoes every night .
okay , well , how about this :
until priya gets her own place ,
you stay here and i &apos;ll stay at your apartment .
can i bring girls here ?
you ?
sure . bring as many as you want .
okay , deal .
just not against their will .
you really think you should be eating that cake ?
why ?
if you &apos;re gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife ,
you might want to watch your waistline .
he &apos;s right .
a minute on the lips , a lifetime on the hips .
yeah , ha @-@ ha .
first of all , i &apos;m not threatened by my fiance &apos;s success .
i &apos;m proud of her .
and secondly , i have my own career .
until you have kids .
good news , raj .
i got the blood work back from the lab .
you &apos;re okay to stay for a while .
when did you take my blood ?
not important .
your sugar was a little high .
i &apos;d follow up with your regular physician .
in the meantime , i have some paperwork here
for you to go over .
what the hell is this ?
boilerplate stuff .
a modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest .
and a living will and durable power of attorney .
this says you can make &quot; end of life &quot; decisions for me .
as your friend , let &apos;s hope it doesn &apos;t come to that .
please sign .
did you sign this ?
there &apos;s a reciprocity clause .
you get to pull the plug on him , too .
well , that seems fair .
congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard .
here &apos;s your i.d. card ,
your key and your lapel pin .
which leonard was too cool to wear .
fyi , part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem
will be to drive me to and from work ,
the comic book store , the barbershop
and the park for one hour every other sunday for fresh air .
bring a ball or a frisbee ,
you know , something he can chase .
also , you &apos;re tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners .
tonight is thai food .
you &apos;ll find the standard order in appendix b
or downloadable from my ftp server .
if you have any questions ,
here &apos;s the faq sheet ,
or if you prefer the human touch ,
i do a live web chat called &quot; apartment talk &quot; on tuesday nights
no backsies .
sheldon , dinner !
what is this ?
this is the difference between eating and dining .
remarkable . i &apos;m just realizing how much
leonard &apos;s been skating by all these years .
it &apos;s not a big thing .
just think of me as a brown martha stewart .
hey , sheldon ,
did you change your wi @-@ fi password again ?
yes , it &apos;s &quot; penny , get your own wi @-@ fi . &quot; no spaces .
thanks .
what &apos;s with the fancy spread ?
my new roommate is bending over backwards
to ingratiate himself to me .
uh , nice touch , by the way .
what do you mean &quot; new roommate &quot; ? what happened to leonard ?
the same thing that happened to homo erectus .
he was replaced by a superior species .
i &apos;m the new homo in town .
that came out wrong .
all right , let me try this again . where &apos;s leonard ?
he &apos;s living at my place , so i &apos;m living here .
you &apos;re living here provisionally .
but i must say it &apos;s looking good .
leonard and priya are living together ?
that &apos;s big .
no . origami napkin swans ...
that &apos;s the headline .
it &apos;s a good thing .
so do you know what kind of research you &apos;ll be doing
at this pharmaceutical company ?
well , there are a couple of opportunities available ,
but i volunteered for the premature ejaculation project .
i mean , it &apos;s not like either one of us has heart disease .
oh , i almost forgot . i got you a little present .
oh , bernie , no . you didn &apos;t have to .
i wanted to . come on , open it .
you bought me a rolex ?
how much did this cost ?
oh , you let me worry about the money .
i just want my baby to have pretty things .
more wine ?
oh , no , no , no . i &apos;ve had way too much already .
here &apos;s an interesting fact about alcohol ...
hit me .
man is not the only species
that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated .
can you guess what the other is ?
hint : sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks .
monkeys .
when does a monkey have a trunk ?
when a suitcase just won &apos;t do .
mmm , all right .
it would appear as if alcohol
is playing keep @-@ away with your intelligence .
good night .
please note , it is now past 10 : 00 p.m.
per our roommate agreement , kindly refrain
from raucous laughter ,
clinking of glasses , and celebratory gunfire .
okay ...
explain something to me .
you watch leonard put up with that guy for years and years .
what has to break inside your brain for you to think ,
&quot; oh , krishna , i &apos;ve got to get me some of that &quot; ?
well , it &apos;s a lot better than having
to wear noise @-@ cancelling headphones in my own apartment .
what ? oh , god , yeah . yeah .
leonard &apos;s a noisy little dude in the sack .
every night .
really ?
even during allergy season , when he has to alternate
between kissing and breathing ?
it &apos;s my sister . can we not talk about this anymore ?
yeah . sorry , sorry .
can i tell you a secret ?
yeah .
i screwed up .
leonard &apos;s a great guy .
never should have broken up with him .
well , uh , to paraphrase shakespeare :
&quot; it &apos;s better to have loved and lost
&quot; than to stay home every night
and download increasingly shameful pornography . &quot;
ohh ... you poor baby .
what &apos;s wrong with me , penny ?
nothing , nothing .
you know , if we weren &apos;t friends ,
and you hadn &apos;t brought up that creepy pornography story ,
i &apos;d be on you like
the speed of light squared on matter to make energy .
hey , you totally got that right !
&quot; e = mc2 . &quot;
i listen .
i have no idea what it means , but i listen .
to friendship .
to friendship .
would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking ? !
and the answer was elephant !
leonard , sweetheart ,
we &apos;re kissing , not eating hot soup .
sorry .
that &apos;s my parents on video chat .
go hide in the bedroom .
oh , come on !
why don &apos;t we just tell them that we &apos;re dating ?
oh , we &apos;ve been through this . it &apos;s not the time .
when is the time ?
i &apos;ve got five brothers and sisters .
one of them is bound to screw up real big ,
and then i &apos;ll tell my parents about you .
now , shoo .
fine .
hello , mummy . hello , daddy .
we heard there was a tornado in kansas city .
is that close to you ?
no .
where is your brother ?
out with friends .
i don &apos;t like it , a young girl alone in an apartment .
i &apos;ll sleep so much better
when you move back here next month .
you &apos;re moving back to india ? !
who &apos;s that ?
oh , my god ! there &apos;s someone in your apartment .
call the police in america !
when were you going to tell &lt; i &gt; me &lt; / i &gt; about this ?
oh , hello , leonard .
what a pleasant surprise !
mummy , daddy , you remember rajesh &apos;s friend leonard .
i thought you said rajesh was out with his friends .
he has many friends .
rajesh has many friends ?
why are you lying to us ?
she &apos;s lying because she doesn &apos;t want you to know
we &apos;re dating .
leonard !
well , what difference does it make ?
if you &apos;re moving back to india , we &apos;re obviously breaking up .
you know what ? i don &apos;t want to deal with this right now .
so ...
hot in india ?
of course it is . it always is . it &apos;s india .
now , what do you have to say for yourself ?
that is a beautiful tapestry .
oh , god .
oh , god !
okay , look .
this never happened .
do you understand me ?
really ? ! still can &apos;t talk to me ?
what are you doing here ?
what ?
i said , what are you doing here ?
i live here .
i have paperwork that says differently .
priya &apos;s going back to india .
irrelevant .
rajesh and i have a good thing going
and you &apos;re not going to ruin it .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve been up all night .
i had a fight with bernadette .
why ?
she gave me a beautiful watch .
leonard , do you understand this ?
yes .
talk to him .
damn .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s not what it looks like .
