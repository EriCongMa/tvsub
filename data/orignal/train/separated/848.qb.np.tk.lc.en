i &apos;m sorry your mother &apos;s not coming , cece .

for an amazing rehearsal dinner .
special shout out to winston for a shockingly good toast .
winston !
insanely good . dipping in and out of french .
powerful stuff , man .
yay !
no .
blessings , blessings on all your households .
all right , i think it &apos;s time to get the bride and the groom
to sleep in separate beds like boy cousins .
wait , wait , can we just say good night first ?
we &apos;ll allow it .
we &apos;ll allow it .
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
i &apos;m gonna do the dishes . dishes .
break it up !
what is this ?
the last night of drama camp ?
enjoy it while you can because it gets boring .
same old lips year after year with no spark ,
just dead tongues touching ,
like decayed salmon .
oh , my god , winston !
i did it !
the night before the wedding ,
a bride is bound to feel a little bit emotional ,
so nervous ? i got xanax .
delicious .
sad , i have a picture of a cat riding a dog like a horse .
is that for me or for you ?
what ?
you freak out , you want to escape to canada ?
i &apos;ve got our passports and ... trudeau pics .
i &apos;m good , you know ? i don &apos;t need anything .
really ? &apos; cause you can ask for anything .
after tomorrow , you &apos;re not gonna be able
to use the bride card anymore .
you &apos;ve got power .
wield it .
i &apos;m gonna go crazy doing this for you one day .
well , sam is the most objectively marry @-@ able guy
i &apos;ve ever dated .
he &apos;s out there washing dishes right now .
and he &apos;s so tall .
so tall .
his jacket on me looks like a garbage bag .
check it out .
what is this ?
what ? what ? what ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
is sam gonna propose ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
nick , let me tell you something .
it has been a pleasure watching you blossom into the best man .
well , thank you for giving me the soil to grow .
good night .
my flash drive is gone !
the flash drive your vows are on ? !
no , a different flash drive !
then what &apos;s the problem ?
i was being sarcastic !
of course the flash drive that my vows are on !
there &apos;s my poet &apos;s fuel .
mm , i might still be drunk from my own toast ,
but my god ,
you are gonna make a beautiful bride someday .
bye .
i &apos;m here . i heard it .
let &apos;s acknowledge that and , uh ,
you know where to find me .
it &apos;s not here . i can &apos;t find it .
i told aly she &apos;d make a beautiful bride someday ,
and then she just bounced .
i mean , why &apos;d i say that ?
we &apos;ve been dating a month .
dude , schmidt lost his vows !
for the wedding ? !
no , different vows .
oh , so then what &apos;s the big deal ?
what is wrong with you people ? !
how &apos;d i lose it ?
i wear it around my neck . i even we--
i even wear it when i got a spray tan .
i think i know what happened .
what ?
is that a piece of my flash drive ?
yes , it is .
you see , earlier tonight , when we were practicing the hora ...
winston , stop trying to throw me off the chair !
that &apos;s not the game !
i don &apos;t mean this anti @-@ jewish at all ,
but that insane jew dance has ruined our lives .
i &apos;m freaking out .
it took me nine months to write those vows .
what do you remember ?
cece ...
i can &apos;t believe this day is finally here .
and then ...
rick santorum said it best when ...
i don &apos;t-- that &apos;s all i got .
that &apos;s all i remember .
that &apos;s all you remember ? !
my vows were like a novel .
how much of your zombie novel do you remember ?
chapter one--
&quot; on jack granger &apos;s 41st birthday ,
he was shot in the face by his dog ed . &quot;
understand the situation that i &apos;m in .
you are so lucky .
how @-@ how am i lucky , nick ?
&apos;cause one of the greatest writers
of our time is about to enter this room .
would you like to meet him ?
all right .
i &apos;ll go get him .
there &apos;s no way it &apos;s not him , right ?
you think it &apos;s him ?
it &apos;s me .
you know what , just &apos; cause he has a ring
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s gonna propose to me tonight or right now .
hey , guys . i &apos;m so sorry to interrupt .
uh , jess , i have something important
i want to talk to you about , when you get a chance .
okay , yeah .
i &apos;ll be right there .
cool pj &apos;s .
i look like the sky .
okay .
this is happening now .
he is going to propose .
i totally didn &apos;t see this coming .
this is great , right ?
yeah .
what was that ?
what was what ?
you paused .
i didn &apos;t pause .
you took , like , a huge pause .
you were like ...
longer than that !
jess--
what aren &apos;t you saying ? that &apos;s what i &apos;m asking .
nothing . if you want to marry sam , i want you to !
you think this is a horrible idea !
you know what the truth is ?
i think that you paused on the inside .
boom .
don &apos;t you boom me .
i boom .
first of all , neither of us should want to say boom .
that &apos;s not ever a cool thing to say .
i &apos;ll decide who says boom !
to write anything , you need to start
with a big idea .
in my last zombie novel , uh @-@ oh guts ,
the big idea was that there were too many guts .
schmidt , you &apos;re gonna say
the first thing that comes to mind
when you think of cece .
cece ...
uh , what a ...
you &apos;re too inside the thing . i @-@ it &apos;s not that hard .
watch me do it .
ooh , now we getting somewhere .
winnie the bish ,
when you feel ready just say her name .
her name .
i &apos;m gonna need you to say , &quot; cece . &quot;
okay , this is not working .
cece .
cece ... average worker .
uneducated , but kind .
wears shoes , boyish ...
never really talked to her .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m listening to you
in the first place .
you &apos;re terrible at talking to women .
case in point : you and reagan .
hey , did you clean everywhere ?
are you happy ?
are you happy that you said that ?
i &apos;d like to smell your towel .
back to the basics , schmidt .
okay , there &apos;s only seven types of stories .
please , don &apos;t list them .
i &apos;m gonna list them .
man vs. man , man vs. dog ,
dog vs. zombie , james bond ,
stories of kings and lords , women over 50
finding themselves after divorce , and car commercial .
my favorite is , uh , that toyota ,
uh ... ev @-@ every-- the family &apos;s in the car ...
you &apos;re thinking of the food commercial .
really ?
fat boy talks to idiot .
okay , eight , fat boy talks to idiot .
we &apos;re getting nowhere . winston ,
i need some of that toast magic .
what do you got ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m done
speaking from the heart . i ...
basically ruined my love life today .
here &apos;s my advice to you .
okay .
keep your guard up .
don &apos;t be too vulnerable around her .
what ?
be standoff @-@ ish , close yourself .
when she looks at you , cross your arms .
turn your back on her .
for wedding vows , that &apos;s terrible advice .
yeah ... i get it ,
but you don &apos;t really , like , know how she feels .
did i do it ?
did he do it ?
okay ...
all right .
you &apos;re welcome .
that was terrible , winston !
slow down , take a breath ,
why don &apos;t we just talk about it and figure out what you want ?
no , that &apos;s what i always do .
i talk and i talk .
not this time .
i &apos;m gonna , i &apos;m gonna ...
push through the panic
and i &apos;m gonna ... say yes .
really ?
i &apos;m gonna go get proposed to .
okay , look , well , if you start freaking out
and you need anything , just holler , okay ?
i will not need anything from you !
if you get chilly , here &apos;s a blanket that i knitted you .
it took me all year .
sam ?
you left your jacket in my room .

everything inside of me just said , &quot; yes . &quot;
i just looked at him .

i &apos;m supposed to be your best man .
i screwed you , schmidt .

it &apos;s all i want .
it &apos;s all i ever want to do
is just to make her happy .

i don &apos;t know why i said it , it just came out ,
and i went from the happiest to the saddest person
i &apos;ve ever been in 15 seconds .
i just need to be cooler around her .
coach , this is where you come into play .
i need your help , man .
i &apos;m tired of being a sweetie pie .
no more talking .
this part of the game , coach ?
heavy .
why are we out here ? this is nice .
dude .
hey , man .
how are you gonna ask me to help you play games with aly , man ?
you don &apos;t want that .
be who you are .
now , the only way to find out why she left ,
is to go over there and ask her .
now .
yeah , but ...
just do it !
i don &apos;t yell in new york because everyone yells there
and it &apos;s less meaningful , but i will yell here .
now push the button .
god .
you really don &apos;t yell in new york ?
dude , i &apos;m always in a museum .
oh , my goodness .
i &apos;m always in a museum .
so that &apos;s basically how you play true american .

she &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s your best friend , you &apos;re both doctors .
this morning , i ... i went to drop her off at the airport ,
and i just ... i just couldn &apos;t let her go ,
and it made me realize that i ...
i just ... i want to spend the rest of my life with her ,
and , you know , uh , it &apos;s hard to express the feelings in words .
really ? ! really ?
why can no one put this into words ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so sorry about the timing .
i just ... i didn &apos;t want you to have to
cut my photo out of all the , you know , wedding pictures .
and then with winston &apos;s toast ,
with the ... all the talk about honor and integrity and ...
the gig economy , i just ...
can we just wait to tell people ?
i ... i don &apos;t want to make it about me before the wedding .
of course .
thanks .
hey , i hope ...
i hope diane really likes the ring .
what ring ?
the ring in your jacket pocket .
i don &apos;t have a ring in my jacket pocket .
i have a ring in my jacket pocket .
yeah .
this isn &apos;t mine .
&quot; to susan . love louise . &quot;

ma ?
ma ? !
are you proposing to your friend susan ?
ma ? !
oh , winston , now &apos;s really not a good time .
i know saying the word &quot; bride &quot; to you was a little crazy ,
but let me just explain myself , okay ?
what i meant to say is that you &apos;re beautiful .
every day with you is so much better .
your brain is banging .
the skin @-@ bag it comes in ain &apos;t too bad either .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
you know what , except that i &apos;m not sorry , okay ?
because this is who i am .
no , winston , i have food poisoning .
yeah , i don &apos;t know who let
nick &apos;s mute park friend cook dinner for 20,
but i want to find and throw up on them .
that &apos;s why you left .
why didn &apos;t you just tell me ?
because i don &apos;t like being vulnerable .
it was stupid of me . i &apos;m sorry .
i ...
i ...
i love you , you maniac .
you love ... you love me ?
i love you .
i love you , too .
wow , that feels so good to say .
i love you .
i love you .
i love you .
i love you .
i ... love ... you .
how is there anything left ?
you okay ?
so sorry for ruining your engagement .
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t plan a joint celebration
with a man wearing a beer can crown
and pillows on his shoes .
jealous &apos; cause i &apos;m the true american .
we &apos;re sorry we left the ring in your room .
that &apos;s what we get for fooling around in your bed .
something about those high ceilings .
we just like tossing each other around .
hello !
hey , quick show of hands ,
who &apos;s had sex in jess &apos;s room ?
well , i &apos;ve had sex in your room .
i know .
what ? !
everyone &apos;s had sex in my room ?
i got weird in there .
i &apos;ve gotten weirder in there than you have .
really ?
those pillows .
there &apos;s just , like , extra , like ...
pressure .
if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to say
a few words about my mom and my mom &apos;s ...
my mom &apos;s friend susan .
my mom &apos;s friend susan .
god , you guys , let me talk .
look , susan , i know i never fully accepted you .
i just ... i didn &apos;t know how long you were gonna be around .
and , also , you used to call my mom the big ragoo
and me the little ragoo ,
and i couldn &apos;t make any sense of it .

to my mom ... and my mom .
yeah !
cheers ! cheers .

opa . yeah !
cece ?
babe , what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s just that you &apos;re gonna have two moms at the wedding ,
and i &apos;m not even gonna have one .
i really thought that ... i really thought that
she would just show up last @-@ minute
&apos;cause she would know how happy it would make me .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m crying in here .
jess &apos;s room is meant for sex .
i know . i know .
