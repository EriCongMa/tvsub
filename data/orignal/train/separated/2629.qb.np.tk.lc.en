助理法官
you said you were there on official business
when you encountered mr. ames on the ship the phoenix .
you &apos;re the target of a federal murder investigation .
you really think the best choice at this point is to shut me out ?
i strongly advise you to not commit perjury to protect her .
you asked me a question , and i answered it .
are we finished ?
a discharged bullet found at the scene .
it &apos;s a match to agent keen &apos;s firearm .
let &apos;s talk about tom keen .
my ex @-@ husband is dead .
i just need to go back in , okay ?
i don &apos;t care what it is . i &apos;ll take anything .
how &apos;s your german ?
you trained him to be a deep @-@ cover operative .
it &apos;s all he &apos;s ever done .
when one operation ends ,
he comes back to you for another .
what do you want ?
i want tom keen .
you know what that is ?
looks like a bullet .
it &apos;s your bullet .
a forensics team
pried it from the floorboards of the phoenix .
ballistics matched it to your fbi @-@ issued 9mm .
there &apos;s more .
the crime lab
found trace amounts of blood belonging to samuel aleko .
here &apos;s the report . see for yourself .
why are you showing me this ?
because it contradicts every word
that &apos;s come out of your mouth since you walked in here .
because , at a minimum ,
it is direct evidence of your perjury ,
and i &apos;m trying to decide
if it should be exhibit &quot; a &quot; in your murder trial .
you made it very clear
you never saw samuel aleko on the phoenix .
i suppose shooting the man must have slipped your mind .
i sat right here and told you exactly what happened .
maybe wilcox is fabricating evidence
to support his case .
you know my record , agent keen .
there &apos;s no love lost between me and the federal government .
that said , i do recognize
that exceptional measures are sometimes required
to preserve our security .
talk to me .
enough lies .
i see .
well , in that case ,
you really leave me no alternative .
i can &apos;t shield your actions in the name of national security
if you insist on concealing the truth of those actions .
i did not kill eugene ames .
that &apos;s the only truth you need to know .
well , a jury may feel differently .
and something tells me we &apos;re about to find out .
we &apos;re done .
i &apos;ll issue my ruling in the morning .
die entrechteten .
really , aram .
these misanthropes have been on my radar for years .
the fbi must have some kind of file .
no . we do . i &apos;m just finalizing some of the translations .
just a few more seconds .
i &apos;m sorry . i admit i don &apos;t quite follow this plan .
agent keen is facing an indictment
for a murder she didn &apos;t commit .
i &apos;ve found us a lead on the whereabouts
of the one man who can exonerate her --
tom keen .
wait -- what ?
tom keen is dead .
he was shot and killed months ago .
no . agent keen shot him , but she didn &apos;t kill him .
in what may be
agent keen &apos;s single greatest lapse in judgment ,
she saved the imposter
pretending to be her devoted husband ,
opting , instead , to hold him captive
in the rusty hull of an abandoned ship .
please tell me you made that up .
the harbormaster found tom .
he was gonna go to the police ,
so tom killed him to keep liz from going to prison .
that is ...
insane ?
i was going to say &quot; extremely romantic . &quot;
if we can bring tom back
and get denner to realize that tom killed eugene ames ,
then maybe we can still stop liz from being indicted .
okay . here we go .
according to our assets in dresden ,
you are looking at
the leadership structure of die entrechteten .
what the hell does that mean ?
&quot; the disenfranchised . &quot;
they may look like common street thugs ,
but don &apos;t underestimate their authority .
they &apos;re racists masquerading as patriots .
&quot; germany for germans . &quot;
on the surface , they &apos;re all about anti @-@ immigration
and preservation of the aryan race ,
but look a little deeper , and you &apos;ll find they care
far less about white power than they do about white powder .
they &apos;re drug dealers ?
among the most ruthless in europe .
somewhere along the line , they realized that keeping
german neighborhoods white is more than politics .
it &apos;s economics .
these guys are fighting a street war .
interpol estimates at least a dozen
drug @-@ related homicides in the last year alone .
you &apos;re telling me that tom keen ,
the four @-@ eyes who taught third grade ,
is walking into that ?
how do we find him ?
i can check , but i don &apos;t think
we have any friends on the inside .
i do .
i &apos;m coming with you .
no , you &apos;re not .
she &apos;s my partner , and you might need a hand
from this side of the law to clear her name .
you open your mouth , donald ,
and hay flies out .
you look and feel and smell like cop .
you are what you are . it &apos;s admirable .
but this is my world , and you &apos;re a tourist .
you blink wrong , we are both dead
and your partner goes to prison .
i &apos;ll keep my mouth shut and stay out of the way .
what &apos;s going on ?
agent ressler and i
were just discussing travel arrangements .
what are you doing here ?
we found tom .
we &apos;re gonna make him come back ,
tell the judge that you &apos;re innocent .
can we talk ?
what are you doing ?
whatever it takes to keep you safe .
finding tom will not keep me safe .
i lied to the court .
we can handle the perjury count .
it &apos;s the murder charge i &apos;d like to avoid .
how ?
judge denner &apos;s right . i covered it up .
at the very least , i &apos;m an accessory after the fact .
listen to me .
juries care about intent .
you didn &apos;t intend to kill the harbormaster .
that was tom &apos;s decision .
right now , that judge may think you &apos;re guilty ,
and it &apos;s not easy to let a cold @-@ blooded killer go free ,
even in the name of national security .
but a cold @-@ blooded killer you are not .
if we can prove tom is responsible ,
it might just tip the scales .
it &apos;s my fault . i never should have put him there .
he &apos;ll go to prison for the rest of his life
because of me .
one step at a time , lizzy .
he &apos;s not gonna come back .
he will .
this journey we &apos;re on isn &apos;t over just yet .
you may have given up on us , but i haven &apos;t .
ruddiger !
i heard the good news !
good news ? i &apos;m in rehab .
precisely .
it requires a great deal of courage and intestinal fortitude
for a man to take that first step toward sobriety .
i couldn &apos;t do it myself .
it was court @-@ ordered .
i got drunk and crashed my daughter &apos;s passat .
she &apos;ll never speak to me again .
what &apos;s the ninth step , again ?
make amends to those you harmed ?
what do you want ?
you do any business with die entrechteten ?
no .
but i do know others who have .
arms dealer name of kohl .
splendid .
perhaps you could put me in touch with him .
you best try a ouija board .
he was assassinated -- shot dead in his car .
they do business now with an austrian --
becker , i think .
since when did a pack of stuempers like die entrechteten
get access to military hardware ?
word is they recruited a new boy .
they &apos;re looking for f2000 machine guns .
you know where or when ?
no .
but if you wire some cash into my patient account ,
they &apos;ll let me use the phone .
i &apos;ll ask around .
thank you , max .
yeah .
and remember -- one day at a time , pal .
so , the man we &apos;re looking for is a franz becker ?
the holiest man i &apos;ve ever seen .
what church ?
god , no .
i mean he is literally covered in holes .
every square inch of the man is pierced .
it &apos;s impressive .
that &apos;s who you think tom reached out to ?
that &apos;s who i would reach out to .
unfortunately , tom and i share some propensities .
whatever you think you know about tom keen ,
forget it .
the bookish elementary @-@ school teacher
was a masterful illusion .
the man is an extremely talented covert operative .
i &apos;m not surprised he convinced you
that his persona was real .
once he takes on a new identity , he convinces himself .
women &apos;s dresses .
women &apos;s dresses , huh ?
yes , jeff , i understand you &apos;re my financial planner ,
but i &apos;m not asking for your advice on this .
i just need you to do it .
jeff , of course i know it &apos;s a lot of money .
thank you .
you have the routing number ?
no , i want the account closed and the money transferred today .
thanks again .
sir , i was just coming --
i perjured myself .
i told the judge that you were on that ship
for official business , under oath .
i &apos;ve crossed my share of lines in this job ,
but i always told myself that wouldn &apos;t be one of them .
of course you know that . you were counting on it . - sir --
i made it clear that i would not lie to the court ,
i ordered you not to put me in that position ,
and you intentionally did exactly that .
i &apos;m sorry , sir . i never wanted --
that is exactly what you wanted ! damn it , keen ! grow up !
you want to play the angles ?
you want to leverage your friends and colleagues ,
at least have the decency to admit it .
i &apos;m not sorry for what i did ,
but i am sorry that it had to be done .
i wanted berlin dead .
i wanted him to pay for what he did
to meera , to you , to all of us .
i brought tom to that ship for us .
i don &apos;t regret it ,
and i &apos;m not gonna lay down and quietly go to prison for it .
can you even hear yourself , agent keen ?
you held another human being captive .
you set in motion a chain of events
that cost an innocent man his life .
what you did wasn &apos;t right . it wasn &apos;t necessary .
it was a crime --
way outside the lines of what we stand for .
i came in here to say that i don &apos;t recognize you anymore .
but after what i did today , the truth is ,
i don &apos;t recognize myself .
sir , you &apos;re bleeding .
are you all right ?
i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
oh ! sir !
i need help in here !
so , it &apos;s ink now .
my goodness , franz .
as if you hadn &apos;t found enough ways
to decorate that pink hide of yours .
hello , red .
you know , freud hypothesized that tattoos are a defense mechanism ,
a way of externalizing some internal trauma .
so tell me -- what secret pain are you hiding
beneath that already crowded exterior ?
dude , i just like tattoos .
i thought perhaps it had something to do
with that recent snafu at the airport .
i heard about what happened with your shipment .
what do you want , red ?
a quiet place next to a lovely stream
where i can watch things float by ...
someday .
but i do have a certain sway
with the appropriate german authorities .
i can get your shipment released from customs .
this is very kind of you .
what &apos;s the catch ?
in exchange for getting your weapons released ,
i keep 35 % of the shipment -- a transaction fee .
red , those weapons aren &apos;t mine .
they &apos;re earmarked for a client .
i &apos;m about to close with another broker
to replace the shipment .
that &apos;ll cost you dearly .
i &apos;m supposed to make delivery tonight .
and those aren &apos;t the kind of guys
you want to piss off .
my evening &apos;s wide open .
and there &apos;s nothing i appreciate more
than customer service .
it appears we &apos;re partners , franz .
so , just sit back and let that tattoo dry or set
or whatever the hell it is tattoos do ,
and i &apos;ll handle the negotiations on our behalf .
dr. harper . i &apos;m agent keen .
i was with director cooper when he was brought in .
you were present for the seizure ?
yes , is that what that was ? he seemed fine ,
and then all of a sudden his nose ...
liz .
oh , my god .
charlene .
where is he ? w @-@ what are they saying ?
this is dr. harper . this is mrs. cooper .
mrs. cooper , your husband &apos;s being evaluated as we speak .
is he conscious ?
i &apos;m afraid not , but it &apos;s still early .
it appears your husband experienced
a rather significant seizure
that may be due to his condition ,
or his condition exacerbated by a high level of stress .
he was with me .
we were arguing .
but he &apos;s okay ?
i mean , he will be okay ?
mrs. cooper , i wish i could be more specific .
but , as i said , it &apos;s still early .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i know you were expecting franz becker .
but franz and his men
ran into some unexpected turbulence at the airport .
turn your car around and get out of here .
i can &apos;t do that . elizabeth is in trouble .
are you listening ?
you &apos;re gonna get us all killed .
she &apos;s about to be indicted for the harbormaster &apos;s murder .
you need to come back with us .
that &apos;s not happening .
tell her she &apos;s on her own .
you &apos;re damn right there &apos;s a problem .
elias , my name is raymond reddington .
at the risk of sounding immodest ,
perhaps my reputation precedes me .
reddington . i know who you are .
wonderful !
here &apos;s the problem as i see it .
you were expecting a shipment of weapons
from an austrian dealer named franz becker .
unfortunately , that shipment was recently seized
by the bundespolizei .
if you &apos;d like to have your men confirm that
before we proceed , i won &apos;t be offended .
let &apos;s assume i believe you .
let &apos;s assume also you &apos;re going somewhere with this .
i am .
it turns out , dear franzie &apos;s the subject of a bmi investigation .
you ordered guns from a trafficker
who has been under heavy surveillance
for the last two months .
i &apos;m offering the same goods for the same price .
i &apos;m listening .
there is , however ,
one small matter to tidy up first .
this one -- he brokered the deal with franzie .
that means either , one , he has exceptionally poor judgment
or , two , he &apos;s working with the german authorities .
i &apos;m not enamored with either scenario .
elias ...
that &apos;s because i am a cop .
he &apos;s not just a cop .
he &apos;s with the fbi &apos;s counterterrorism task force ,
and he &apos;s on my payroll .
how do you think we know your guy &apos;s under investigation ?
elias .
give him to me .
i &apos;ll bleed him for whatever intelligence he has
and then eliminate the problem .
or maybe i just take him out back and shoot him .
fine ! that works for me .
we got to go after him .
no . we came to deliver a message , and we have .
see ? that &apos;s why we got the insurance .
dembe !
brad ! brad !
i told you she was guilty . she &apos;s getting ready to run .
what is this ?
agent keen just closed one of her accounts .
she moved all the money to an offshore account an hour ago .
it &apos;s not illegal to close an account , detective .
what &apos;s illegal is monitoring her financials
without a warrant .
please .
main justice wants to shut down our murder investigation
and we have to play by the rules ?
yes , we do .
i know you want to solve this , marty ,
but you &apos;re taking it way too personally .
look , she knows she &apos;s gonna be indicted .
that money is on its way out of country ,
and agent keen is leaving right behind it .
ressler .
give me reddington .
it &apos;s him .
you know , they say you can judge a man
by the company he keeps .
do you have any idea what you just did ?
i was in .
yes . and now you &apos;re out .
you didn &apos;t seem inclined
to leave your new friends willingly ,
so i had to improvise .
i was on assignment .
i had a contract .
circumstances change .
think , tom .
i &apos;m the one who told you to go and never come back ,
so for me to be responsible for your return ,
you must know i don &apos;t have a comparable option .
no . i am not going back .
she &apos;ll be indicted .
not just for perjury ,
not just for obstruction -- for murder .
the local authorities think she killed the harbormaster .
she &apos;s going to prison .
i &apos;m the only reason she &apos;s not in prison already .
that harbormaster was gonna call the cops .
yes , but that &apos;s all beside the point .
you know what to do , tom .
are you gonna let a crime you committed to protect elizabeth
be the reason she goes to jail ?
like you care .
what does that mean ?
you are using her .
you have been using her from the very beginning .
you need her on the outside
so you can keep your little task force up and running .
i &apos;m glad we had this talk .
i know you &apos;ll do the right thing .
listen to me . i am gone .
lizzy did this to herself
the second she threw me in that hole .
i am not going down .
not for her .
and sure as hell not for you .
any word ?
you really don &apos;t have to stay .
well ...
charlene , the last thing i want to do is pry ,
but dr. harper mentioned his &quot; condition . &quot;
harold &apos;s a private man .
harold has a brain tumor .
glioblastoma , it &apos;s called .
doctors found it last year
when he was admitted after being attacked .
they suggested that he leave the bureau .
any undue stress could exacerbate his illness .
but -- but harold , that -- that job ...
it means everything to him .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i had no idea .
the original prognosis was less than a year .
but we found this experimental trial program .
by some miracle , harold was accepted .
they were giving him some new chemotherapy drug .
we thought it might be working ,
but after today ...
i &apos;m not so sure .
liz , you can &apos;t say anything .
please promise me .
harold is so proud , the idea that
you and the others feeling sorry for him --
no , i understand .
this stays between us . you have my word .
thank you .
i &apos;m collecting signatures for a get @-@ well card for mr. cooper .
&quot; get well , bitch . we &apos;ve got some partying to do &quot; ?
too much ?
i just thought -- i mean ,
i wanted to make him laugh , you know ?
i mean , if it &apos;s serious .
liz called from the hospital .
she did ? and is it bad ? it &apos;s bad , isn &apos;t it ?
apparently , he &apos;s hypoglycemic .
low blood sugar ?
worst @-@ case scenario , he &apos;s pre @-@ diabetic .
he &apos;ll be fine .
guess i don &apos;t need the card anymore .
did you find tom ?
yeah , we found him .
told him what was at stake . he wasn &apos;t moved .
didn &apos;t realize you were interested in his opinion .
we were interested in his confession .
he made it clear we weren &apos;t gonna get it .
so you went all that way and you didn &apos;t bring him back ?
all rise .
i will make this quick .
this whole business started
because the justice department sought to quash
a lawful subpoena issued to harold cooper ,
assistant fbi director .
ms. wright ?
mr. cooper had a medical issue , your honor .
he &apos;s unable to be with us .
is that right ?
well , do send him my best .
let him know he &apos;s not the only one sickened by this proceeding .
for the record , i have completed my in camera assessment
of the justice department &apos;s position .
your honor , before you continue , may i have a word ?
you &apos;ve made yourself amply clear , counsel .
sidebar , your honor ?
denied .
on behalf of the attorney general himself ,
i must insist .
the attorney general ?
get up here -- both of you .
if the attorney general is so interested
in what goes on in my courtroom ,
he can come down here and tell me himself .
he will .
maybe not in person , but i &apos;ve been informed
a representative will be here shortly .
too little , too late .
i &apos;m asking the court to withhold any ruling
until the a.g. &apos; s rep has been afforded ...
denied .
look at my face , ms. wright .
get as close as you feel is necessary
to understand what i &apos;m saying .
denied .
your honor .
what is it ?
we have a situation in the corridor .
&quot; a situation &quot; ? what the hell does that mean ?
there &apos;s someone out there
demanding that he speak with you .
he says he &apos;s the killer .
i see .
well , then , i guess you should bring him in .
the officer informs me
that you have confessed to the murder of eugene ames .
tom ?
yes .
and you are ?
my name is tom keen .
mr. keen .
i &apos;m so relieved .
somebody told me you were dead .
your ex @-@ wife said you were dead .
she said she shot you in self @-@ defense
when you abducted her for berlin .
she saved me .
she held you captive on the boat the phoenix
to squeeze you for intelligence about your employer .
yeah , look . none of that matters .
all right , the only thing that matters
is that i killed that man .
the guy walked on the wrong ship at the wrong time .
so you snapped his neck , just like that .
no .
it took a few seconds .
why are you telling me all this ?
you do realize what &apos;s going to happen to you
as a result of your confession today .
i don &apos;t care what happens to me . i came here for her .
all right , i need you to know
that elizabeth keen would never have hurt ...
i don &apos;t even remember his name .
his name was eugene ames .
i killed eugene ames without liz &apos;s help .
in fact , she tried to stop me . she begged me not to do it .
i just saw charlene . she said it was okay .
come in .
from agent mojtabai .
apparently , aram thought i died .
you might have if you hadn &apos;t missed the corner of my desk
on your way down .
now , about what you were saying ,
our conversation ...
agent keen -- - no .
i told you i wouldn &apos;t put you in the position
where you had to lie for me ,
and i did , and i am ashamed of that .
i know you believe you were acting
in the interests of the task force .
doesn &apos;t justify it .
i wouldn &apos;t even be here if it weren &apos;t for you .
i mean , i certainly couldn &apos;t have survived
the last year and a half without you .
you &apos;re the only person in the world i completely trust .
and to hear you say that you don &apos;t even recognize me ...
i &apos;m not upset at you for changing .
after what you &apos;ve been pulled into ,
i @-@ it would be impossible for you not to .
i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m upset because i don &apos;t want to see
the person that i first met , that good person --
i don &apos;t want to see her get lost in all of it .
the doctor is ready to discuss the test results .
you know , before today ,
i would have said i had seen everything .
now i know i haven &apos;t seen a damn thing .
even if what you &apos;re saying is true ,
elizabeth keen still has a lot to answer for .
doesn &apos;t matter now .
well , we &apos;ll see if your wife agrees
when she &apos;s serving felony time for perjury ,
not to mention facing an indictment for kidnapping ,
witness tampering , obstruction .
you can make all that go away .
prosecution could still charge her with murder .
i told you she didn &apos;t kill anyone .
they will argue that she acted in concert . she didn &apos;t stop you .
she knew that the harbormaster would contact the police .
she wanted him to die .
at a minimum , she was an accessory after the fact .
she had no intent .
i was the one who made the decision to act .
yeah , so you say .
the harbormaster would have saved you .
why kill him ?
to protect her .
the woman you spent the last two years of your life betraying ?
someone you lied to , spied on , sold out , and betrayed ?
a woman you married as a job ?
she held you prisoner !
she wasn &apos;t thinking clearly .
i needed to do something ,
or she would have gone to prison .
you &apos;re in love with her .
i won &apos;t even try to express how twisted that is .
okay , mr. keen , or whatever the hell your name is .
you want to fall on your sword for this woman , so be it .
i will recommend that agent keen
not be charged with the murder of eugene ames .
but as to the other potential charges ,
i &apos;m allowing the grand jury to proceed .
officers !
find a seat for mr. keen in the pens until further notice .
wait ! listen !
i will make a confession . i will give you a full deal .
but you have to promise me that you leave liz out of this .
that deal won &apos;t happen .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor .
i told mr. connolly you were --
it &apos;s fine , rosemary .
get him out of here .
well , well , well .
reven wright said
that main justice would be sending an attack dog .
you &apos;re out of your mind .
i mean , the beltway &apos;s been saying it for years ,
but you really are out of your mind .
well , in 30 years on the bench ,
i &apos;ve learned their bark is far worse than their bite .
not this time .
what did you do , richard ? what the hell did you do ?
i conducted an in camera hearing ,
which i have every right to do .
you have no right , and you damn well know it .
you &apos;re not cleared to hear national security cases .
we have a fisa court for that ,
and you &apos;re not on it -- period .
you compelled two federal agents to divulge national secrets
under threat of imminent incarceration .
they violated my order .
to hell with your order !
your order was a per se violation
of the espionage act , the patriot act .
intimidation , threats --
this is the way our government works .
i &apos;m supposed to just take your word
for the fact that this case involves national security ?
that &apos;s right .
you &apos;re a superior court judge , richard .
this case is so far over your head ,
it &apos;d make your nose bleed .
you intentionally accessed classified intelligence
without authority .
i should have you arrested right here and now .
smiling tommy connolly .
you always were a smug bastard .
and you were always a paranoid , self @-@ righteous prick ...
your honor .
here &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
you &apos;re gonna quash this subpoena .
and if i don &apos;t ?
you will .
in everyone &apos;s career , there &apos;s a crossroads ,
richard-- a moment where what they &apos;ll say next
will define their lives ,
decide their future .
is this task force really that important to you ?
i don &apos;t know what that is .
and neither do you .
you crossed the line .
i &apos;m willing to move past it .
and who knows ?
maybe one day , when i &apos;m a.g. ,
we &apos;ll get you on a real court .
it appears as if the treatment you were receiving
in the clinical trial
has slowed the growth of the glioblastoma .
but the seizure ?
chemo drugs are powerful .
they have side effects .
that can include damaged neurons .
my guess is that &apos;s what caused the seizure .
you think it was a side effect from the medication ?
yes .
and no reflection on your overall health .
which you &apos;re saying is improving .
this is one test ,
and your husband has a very aggressive illness .
but it does appear as if we should stay the course .
and you &apos;ll be discharged this afternoon .
now , we &apos;ll continue to monitor these side effects .
all rise .
oh , sit down .
the government has shown nothing but disrespect
for this court &apos;s authority ,
so spare me the hollow reverence .
let me be clear .
government secrecy --
the idea that the federal government can act ,
can surveil , can detail , can interrogate ,
and even kill american citizens
with no oversight or accountability ,
with no obligation to present the people with the evidence
that led to their actions --
that , in my view ,
is the gravest threat to our national security .
it erodes the very foundation of our great democracy .
this is a system of checks and balances
founded on a separation of powers .
the fact that any federal prosecutor
who utters the magic words , who invokes national security ,
can suppress cases ,
can quash subpoenas , can avoid grand juries --
that offends me !
and so ... i &apos;m very glad that in this matter ,
the government has done the responsible thing
and complied with my request
to review the evidence supporting its claim .
having done so ... i am satisfied
that if assistant director cooper or agent keen
were compelled to testify ,
it would expose national secrets
and have the potential to do material damage
to the national interest .
your honor !
let me save you the trouble , mr. markin .
you and i , for all of our accomplishments ,
remain rather small fish in this deep
and dark federal pool .
if that point hasn &apos;t already been made clear to your boss ,
i &apos;m sure it will be very shortly .
you can &apos;t do this !
a man is dead , a lieutenant in the metro p.d. !
and his death is a tragedy , sir .
agent keen , his name was lieutenant eugene ames .
never forget it .
and let the good work you do from this day forward
in some way be a tribute to his memory .
that &apos;s it .
you have to live with that .
you know what you did .
marty , let &apos;s go .
so -- so , t @-@ that &apos;s how it is now , right ?
t @-@ the feds are just above the law .
you know , he was a good man .
and now i have to go out in that hallway ,
and i &apos;ve got to explain to his wife and daughter
how there &apos;s no justice for a guy
who gave most of his life in service to this city .
that &apos;s enough .
can &apos;t really blame him .
he &apos;s playing a game with less than half the pieces .
maybe it should have ended .
maybe he &apos;s right .
what &apos;s gonna happen to tom ?
who ?
my ex @-@ husband , tom keen ?
i never met him .
there &apos;s no tom keen in federal custody .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s just -- we tried .
missed you in court today , harold .
i hope everything &apos;s all right .
♬ we were tight @-@ knit boys ♬
you made it all disappear -- just like that .
♬ brothers in more than name ♬
hey , think of it this way .
♬ you would kill for me and knew that i &apos;d do the same ♬
most americans would kill for that kind of job security .
♬ and it cut me sharp ♬
i didn &apos;t think you knew everything
about our little task force .
♬ hearing you &apos;d gone away ♬
learn something every day .
♬ but everything goes away , yeah , everything goes away ♬
i was serious when i said i &apos;d be the next a.g.
i &apos;ve been briefed on reddington ...
♬ but i &apos;m going to be here until i &apos;m nothing ♬
and a handful of other things
i instantly wished i didn &apos;t know .
♬ but bones in the ground ♬
but that &apos;s the gig .
i &apos;m starting to think maybe the gig is getting old .
♬ and i was there when you grew restless ♬
so am i.
no .
you don &apos;t mean that .
♬ left in the dead of night ♬
maybe you &apos;re a little dinged up .
but you &apos;re still at the top of your game .
♬ and i was there when three months later ♬
you perjured yourself for one of your team .
i admit i didn &apos;t expect that .
♬ you were standing in the door ♬
but i sure as hell do respect it .
♬ all beat and tired ♬
gusse my principles aren &apos;t what they used to be .
♬ and i stepped aside ♬
neither are yours .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , buddy .
i never had any principles .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m on a rocket to the top .
this thing with reddington --
it &apos;s important .
you &apos;ve done more since you started ...
♬ everything goes away ♬
than most of our best covert units do in a lifetime .
♬ yeah , everything goes away ♬
we &apos;d do worse than we did today to protect it .
♬ but i &apos;m going to be here until i &apos;m nothing ♬
♬ but bones in the ground ♬
and hey .
♬ so quiet down ♬
now i have something to hold over your head .
just kidding , buddy .
you have a good night .
the paperwork is complete .
the account has been established for mr. ames &apos; daughter .
you sure you want to do this ?
yes .
and the scholarship , it &apos;s ...
anonymous , correct ?
♬ we were opposites at birth ♬
yes . the bank will reach out .
♬ i was steady as a hammer ♬
and they &apos;ll explain everything .
thank you .
♬ no one worried &apos; cause they knew just where i &apos;d be ♬
now i understand
why you sold the apartment i gave you .
♬ and they said you were the crooked kind ♬
eugene ames was 67 years old .
♬ and that you &apos;d never have no worth ♬
the only reason he was still working ...
♬ but you were always gold to me ♬
was to get his daughter through college .
be careful , lizzy .
♬ and back when we were kids ♬
because the truth of it is , once you start down this road ...
♬ we swore we knew the future ♬
there &apos;s no logical place to stop .
♬ and our words would take us halfway &apos; round the world ♬
you can see to her education , health insurance , housing .
♬ but i never left this town ♬
you can watch her ...
♬ and you never saw new york ♬
or have her watched ...
♬ and we ain &apos;t ever cross the sea ♬
keep her safe ...
try to ascertain her ...
hopes , dreams , desires .
♬ but i am fine with where i am now ♬
pull strings , call in favors ...
♬ this home is home and all that i need ♬
to discreetly smooth the path .
and for the first few years , it may work .
♬ but for you , this place is shame ♬
you &apos;ll draw some measure of virtue
from being her invisible benefactor .
♬ but you can blame me when there &apos;s no one left to blame ♬
but that won &apos;t last .
♬ oh , i don &apos;t mind ♬
it &apos;s all a fraud .
that it &apos;s really not about her at all .
that it &apos;s all about you .
and you &apos;re just ...
going through the motions to salve your own guilt .
look , all the money , all the time and effort ,
all the favors in the world
cannot possibly equal what you took away from her .
everything else is ...
just a nice gesture .
♬ all my life ♬
♬ i &apos;ve never known where you &apos;ve been ♬
you knew about tom
that if he came back ...
♬ there were holes in you ♬
they &apos;d exonerate him to protect the task force .
♬ the kind that i could not mend ♬
he &apos;d get his life back .
♬ and i heard you say ♬
you saved a man you hate ...
♬ right when you left that day ♬
to save me .
♬ does everything go away ♬
♬ yeah , everything goes away ♬
♬ but i &apos;m gonna be here till forever ♬
♬ so just call when you are around ♬
keen .
hey , it &apos;s me .
you okay ?
where are you ?
are you okay ?
