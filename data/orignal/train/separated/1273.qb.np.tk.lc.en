it &apos;s pleasure to have you high @-@ school mock trialers in my courtroom .
and so we begin in the matter of the state vs. fontaine .
good evening .
my name is ashley harper , and i represent the state .
in plain , simple language ,
this was an act of violence motivated by sheer greed .
we will prove that robert fontaine
armed himself with a semiautomatic pistol
and entered estate diamonds jewelry store .
judge harper ?
mom ? !
oh , my god ! mom ? !
kathleen ?
oh , my god !
someone call 911 !
ashley . ashley , let me help her .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
what &apos;s wrong with her ? !
kathleen ?
can you hear me ?
please , mr. thorson , help her !
kathleen !
oh , god . no .
oh , please , no .
n @-@ no , ma . i want regular .
but ... no , you can &apos;t have caffeinated beverages
this late in the day , jane .
okay , maura says i can &apos;t drink it .
so , can i have an i.v. drip , please ?
no , but you can try one of these instead ...
my new espresso brownies .
business is booming !
angela , you should really be offering some healthy snacks .
i do . they just don &apos;t sell .
mmm ! maura , come on .
don &apos;t be so virtuous .
oh , my .
see ? look , i sold 45 brownies yesterday .
and i &apos;ve been averaging an extra $ 100 a week .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re saving for retirement , ma .
yeah , me , too . excuse me , girls .
did you see her face ?
i think she &apos;s hiding something .
hey , ma .
i want you to meet mark , my lawyer .
how do you do ?
mom .
you look so familiar .
yeah , well , i &apos;m kind of famous .
or infamous .
you &apos;ve seen my commercials .
&quot; mark ... the shark . &quot;
call me .
call me .
call me .
you .
you &apos;re the man .
ladies .
do not tell me you hired that man as your lawyer .
okay , i won &apos;t tell you ,
even though you seem to know already .
&quot; shark &quot; is from the german word &quot; schurke , &quot;
which means &quot; creedy parasite . &quot;
hear that ? &quot; parasite . &quot;
why didn &apos;t you go with frost &apos;s lawyer ? !
he &apos;s an expert at personal @-@ injury claims .
mark says there &apos;s too many people suing the storrow center .
can you believe even people who weren &apos;t squished
in that garage want money ?
okay , well , thank god you and t.j.
and detective frost weren &apos;t squished .
yeah .
i got to go tell lydia
mark &apos;s about to get me a settlement .
you two together ?
no , but we will be
once she knows i can support her and t.j.
oh , my god .
what is it ?
judge harper just died in the courthouse .
oh , no !
i @-@ i &apos;ve testified in front of her .
you knew her ?
yeah .
she was one of the good guys .
judge harper &apos;s courtroom was on the second floor .
what was she doing up here ?
she was a mock @-@ trial advisor .
well , that explains all the kids in suits .
i did mock trial .
i always wanted to be the bad guy ,
but they made me the prosecutor .
that &apos;s very impressive .
it &apos;s highly competitive .
i never made the team .
that &apos;s not possible .
the advisor said i was ... &quot; wordy . &quot;
you ?
i knew her husband .
he was a brilliant defense attorney .
died a few years ago . makes this all the more tragic .
oh , god . don &apos;t tell me that &apos;s her daughter .
afraid it is .
oh , no ! was she here when her mother collapsed ?
yeah .
how did you know she collapsed ?
subdermal bleeding on both knees .
okay , what do we have ?
she adjourned her own courtroom at 5 : 00,
and she checked in students when they arrived here 5 : 10 .
... 5 : 25 , didn &apos;t come back until after the competition started .
where did she go ?
nobody knows .
but she left her briefcase here .
okay , let &apos;s have csru collect that .
we &apos;ll go through it later .
she has a broken rib .
did someone give her cpr ?
yeah .
uh , roger thorson , the other mock @-@ trial advisor .
from what he said , it sounds like she went into convulsions .
convulsions ... so if it was a seizure ,
are we looking at natural causes ?
well , convulsions are a neurological response
to many stimuli ... physiological ,
pharmacological , idiopathic .
so , maybe ?
hey . frankie &apos;s been assigned to this ?
yeah , i asked for more help till we can rule out homicide .
i &apos;m gonna go finish interviewing roger and the daughter .
okay .
there &apos;s a wet , tacky substance on her palm .
appears to be paint .
it &apos;s institutional beige .
i &apos;d describe it as more of a taupe or a sand color ,
perhaps even a muted coral with a hint of abalone shell .
am i being wordy ?
a little .
what do you need ?
there &apos;s paint on the victim &apos;s hand .
can you find out which area
of the courthouse was being painted today ?
any idea where to start ?
wherever she was coming from .
well , let &apos;s split up . i &apos;ll look , too .
all right . thanks .
be right back .
roger &apos;s telling me that he and judge harper are old friends .
they went to law school together .
yeah , we had lunch today
to prepare for the competition .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
ashley ...
did your mom have any medical conditions that you know about ?
no . my mom was really healthy .
do you know why she wasn &apos;t in the courtroom
when you started the competition ?
no .
i didn &apos;t even see her leave .
i asked judge manning if we could wait for her ,
but he ...
he said he &apos;d take away points if i didn &apos;t start .
it &apos;s okay .
is there , uh , someone that can take care of her ?
there &apos;s her grandma that lives with them .
i &apos;ll take her home .
come on , sweetie .
it &apos;s frost .
hey , frost . put you on speaker .
frankie found what looks like a left palm print
on the northeast stairwell
between the second and third floors .
that &apos;s the stairwell closest to this courtroom .
anything else ?
her purse is on the landing .
can you show me ?
where &apos;s her wallet ?
right here .
full of cash and credit cards .
so it wasn &apos;t robbery .
sergeant korsak , do you have your magnifying glass ?
thank you .
what is it ?
i was examining her neck . and i noticed blood .
there &apos;s a tiny puncture wound at the base of the skull .
could be from a hypodermic needle .
someone injected her ?
look at this .
appears to be a scratch .
yeah . from a hypodermic needle .
so she fought off someone in the stairwell
who managed to kill her anyway .
i need to know what was in the syringe that killed her , maura .
and i can &apos;t tell you .
you know how this works .
how is it that we can put a rover on mars ,
but the damn crime lab can &apos;t find a toxin
unless we tell them what to look for ?
nasa lost control of that rover .
and science is hard .
you know , they can &apos;t test for everything .
i need to narrow it down .
there are hundreds of thousands of drugs .
yes , i know .
well , whatever was in that syringe
sent her into convulsions , so that should narrow it down .
are you questioning my process ?
no .
yes .
okay , we don &apos;t know what caused the convulsions .
it could be anything from drugs to household cleaning products ,
pesticides , a chemical .
okay , okay . i &apos;m not questioning .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
did you do the nail scrapings yet ?
yes . nothing under the fingernails .
but this scratch on her hand is from the same gauge needle
as the injection .
and she has well @-@ developed gastrocnemii .
calf muscles ?
how did you know ?
well , you pointed ,
and she has the legs of a runner .
yeah , she has an old injury ... fracture of the left patella .
see the pins ?
yeah .
what does that tell us ?
i don &apos;t know yet .
you know she put her husband through law school
when she was a paralegal ?
yeah , she was an extraordinary woman .
and now her kid is an orphan . this makes me sick .
we &apos;ll get it , jane .
i hope so . it &apos;s just not right .
it &apos;s never right .
she &apos;s got 10 or 15 cases on her docket every day .
drugs , guns , murder .
that &apos;s your average day for a felony @-@ trial judge .
did you go through her briefcase ?
yeah .
mainly research , case law , notes .
she was well @-@ organized .
this one &apos;s marked &quot; extensions , &quot; but it &apos;s empty .
maybe she was reviewing extended sentences .
she leaves her chambers on the second floor
and arrives on the sixth floor at 5 : 10,
talks to her students ,
then leaves the courtroom at 5 : 25,
but stumbles back in and dies at 5 : 36 .
wait , how do you know it was 5 : 36 .
the kid who played the court clerk hit the time clock
when ashley stopped her opening statement .
okay , so , we found her stuff in the stairwell ,
which says to me she was going back to her office .
she was a runner .
so how long would it take her to run down
and back up four flights of stairs ?
frost ?
okay .
well , this might be something .
she was assigned a high @-@ profile prescription @-@ drug case .
the defendant was a prominent doctor .
what , he was selling drugs ?
yeah . to the two @-@ six gang .
but his attorney filed a substitution @-@ of @-@ judge motion today .
so the doctor didn &apos;t want judge harper to hear his case .
well , why would he ?
she was tough on professionals who commit crimes .
yeah . and she refused to recuse herself .
so maybe the doctor thought
the only way to get judge harper off the case was to kill her .
a doctor could cook up a lethal injection .
yeah .
45 seconds .
for what ?
to run up four flights of stairs .
above and beyond the call of duty , detective .
so why was the judge gone for 11 minutes ?
did she stop and talk to someone in the stairwell ?
maybe she knew her killer .
that would explain why the only defensive wound
is the scratch with the needle on her hand .
she reacted too late , after she &apos;d been injected .
where are we on those security cameras ?
the whole building &apos;s covered except the stairwells .
all right . go through it all .
we need an exact list of every
person that was in the courthouse today .
i &apos;ll help you .
thanks , frankie .
jane , did you hear what tommy did ?
does it involve a shark ? yeah .
what an idiot .
frost , maybe you can talk to him .
i tried . he called me after he saw &quot; mark the shark &apos;s &quot; ad .
if he &apos;d just chill , he &apos;d eventually get six figures ,
at least that &apos;s what my guy says .
sounds about right for having to be trapped
inside a collapsed building for eight hours .
you guys could have died .
i still have residual pain in my wrist .
and tommy had a head injury .
yeah .
that &apos;s , uh , judge harper &apos;s law clerk .
i had her come in .
i see why . she &apos;s hot .
it &apos;s part of the investigation .
and she &apos;s too smart for you , anyway .
you have me confused with my brother .
let me do the interview with you .
no . you heard jane .
i want you to go through all the security footage
from the courthouse ,
make a list of all the people that entered and exited .
check the court dockets , too .
come on , frost .
i &apos;m gonna try to find where the doctor was
when judge harper was being attacked .
we noticed she had an s.o.j. motion on her docket .
did she pass on the legal sufficiency ,
or did she assign the recusal to another judge ?
how do you know all that ? are you a lawyer ?
no , but he played one in high school .
oh , you did mock trial .
me , too .
judge harper didn &apos;t recuse herself ,
so the doctor had to go before another judge
for a final ruling .
that motion was denied late this afternoon .
like i said ,
killing judge harper &apos;s a way to get your case reassigned .
i can &apos;t believe anyone would want to kill her .
that doctor was the exception .
there were plenty of defendants
that wanted to be assigned to her courtroom .
why is that ?
she believed in rehabilitation
and tried to assign defendants to prison programs
that could help them turn their lives around .
any attorneys or defendants on her other cases
that were squawking about her ?
just the routine stuff .
any grievances filed against her ?
you &apos;d have to check with the cjc .
commission on judicial conduct .
thank you , counselor .
when &apos;s the last time you saw judge harper ?
right before 5 : 30 .
she ran back into her office
to grab something she &apos;d forgotten .
what was it ?
i didn &apos;t ask .
she was rushing to get back to her daughter &apos;s competition .
when did you leave the courthouse ?
around 5 : 30 .
oh , come on . i loved my boss .
she was one of the few judges that made it possible
for women to advance in law .
did judge harper ever take the stairs ?
always . she was a fitness nut .
any health problems you know of ?
being a judge is stressful .
sometimes she &apos;d complain of dizziness , fatigue .
a few times , she ...
tell us what you know , ms. barlow .
this is how you can help her .
a few times , it ...
seemed like she was slurring her speech .
like she &apos;d been drinking ?
yes .
so you dissected the judge &apos;s liver .
you &apos;re sure she wasn &apos;t a drinker ?
uh , yes . her liver was near perfect .
no sign of alcohol abuse .
you ordered the satan special ?
&quot; seitan . &quot; it &apos;s a wheat protein used as a meat substitute .
okay , i get it . it &apos;s ... it &apos;s theme night .
what ?
we &apos;re investigating a mock trial .
you ordered mock meat .
it is very nutritious .
they dissolve the starch to an insoluble gluten
and then cook this elastic mass .
can &apos;t wait to dig in .
oh , uh , the extended panel results came back .
what ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
&apos;cause you were busy
accusing me of ordering you food from the underworld .
i love seitan . okay , tell me .
she tested positive for the presence of amphetamines .
judge harper ?
yeah . it could be a false @-@ positive .
many drugs share similar metabolites ,
but i will have to test every one with a similar chemical makeup .
again with the testing .
you know , you could be
one of the most impatient human beings i know .
but you &apos;re not sure ? maybe you should test it .
you &apos;re wrecking my appetite .
no !
maybe that &apos;s the insoluble gluten mass
that you ordered ?
got your mail .
oh , thanks , tommy .
do you mind putting it on the desk ?
what &apos;s in the bag ?
oh , cans and bottles for recycling .
garbage bags are breeding grounds
for bacterial and fungal pathogens ,
including salmonella , e. coli 0157,
shigella dysentery , legionella ,
listeria monocytogenes ...
she &apos;s not gonna stop talking unless you take outside .
aeromonas hydrophila ...
well , i never got sick .
there &apos;s 20 bucks worth of cans and bottles in there .
look at her . her head &apos;s about to explode .
staphylococci aureus .
look , maura . see ?
cool , jane . is ma back yet ?
no . cavanaugh took her out to dinner .
tommy , would you like some food ?
yeah , i @-@ i don &apos;t eat ... that .
all right , well , since you &apos;re here ,
can we talk about your lawsuit ?
no . we can &apos;t . it &apos;s my life , jane .
i know it &apos;s your l ...
what about t.j. ?
what about him ?
look , mark says he can get me the money now .
frost &apos;s guy says it &apos;s gonna be at least another year .
i need it now .
i think it &apos;s shortsighted and stupid .
you can &apos;t see me as anything
other than a stupid screw @-@ up , can you ?
what ? tommy , come on !
tommy !
tommy , stay and have some tea .
no , i just came by to drop off the cans and bottles for ma .
w @-@ why are you bringing garbage to ma ?
because she needs my help ,
and she doesn &apos;t see me as a screw @-@ up . that &apos;s why .
i really shouldn &apos;t be that hard on him .
he has such a big heart .
and you aren &apos;t listening . you &apos;re going through your mail .
oh . um , i just like sorting and organizing .
i know .
what ?
it &apos;s from the i.r.s. i think it &apos;s an audit .
what are you worried about ?
you break out into hives if you lie .
i mean , if you cheat on your taxes ,
you &apos;re probably gonna get leprosy .
it &apos;s not for me . it &apos;s for your mother .
what ?
what are you doing ?
mail tampering is a crime .
oh , my god .
she owes $ 27,000 in back taxes .
what ? how is that possible ?
she doesn &apos;t even make that in a year .
my father .
he probably cheated on their taxes .
no wonder she &apos;s been trying to make extra money .
tommy probably knows .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s recycling bottles and cans for her .
well , why does she tell tommy and not me and frankie ?
what ? what is that face ? what ?
tommy doesn &apos;t judge .
so , while you two were with the hot law clerk ,
we were going through 4 million hours of security footage .
frankie , cue up the show .
we found dr. simmons , a.k.a. dr. oxycontin ,
coming and going .
well , that &apos;s him and his attorney
entering the courthouse yesterday at 9 : 05 a.m.
and ...
that &apos;s dr. simmons and the same attorney
leaving at 5 : 02 p.m.
right after their motion for a new judge was denied .
yep .
and judge harper was ambushed in the stairwell around 5 : 30,
so the doctor didn &apos;t do it ,
unless he paid someone to do it for him .
maybe we run a list of everyone at the courthouse
against anyone with ties to the two @-@ six gang
that dr. simmons was selling to .
that &apos;s who he &apos;d hire , right ?
makes sense .
i &apos;ll be right there .
what do you want to do about ma ?
nothing . maura &apos;s right .
we do judge .
and ma doesn &apos;t want us to know .
you shouldn &apos;t have opened up her mail .
i wanted to help , frankie .
she doesn &apos;t want our help .
it just makes me so sad .
me , too , janie .
not a single two @-@ six gang member or known associate
was in that courthouse yesterday .
a gang @-@ free day ?
two @-@ six , anyway . i checked .
where &apos;s jane ?
she and frankie went to grab coffee .
what &apos;s up ?
we have a cause of death .
judge harper died of methylphenidate overdose .
translation ?
she had toxic levels of ritalin in her system .
who the hell kills someone with ritalin ?
no one , apparently .
i ran it against all solved and unsolved homicides ... nothing .
well , it &apos;s a common enough drug .
it &apos;s used to treat adhd .
yeah , the drug unit is always busting college kids who abuse it .
helps them stay up and study .
maybe it &apos;s one of the kids on the mock @-@ trial team .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been thinking .
i &apos;m trying to get into the mock @-@ trial website , but damn .
these kids are smart these days .
come on .
let me in .
but wouldn &apos;t that smart teenager realize
that we &apos;d eventually trace the drug ?
plenty of m.e. &apos; s wouldn &apos;t have caught that .
you said mock trial was competitive ?
one kid i knew put his fist through a wall
when he got cast as an understudy ,
tried to put his fist through my face
when he heard i got his role .
yeah !
what ?
i just beat an 128 @-@ bit encryption .
mockyouradvisors . com ?
wow , look at all these complaints about judge harper .
frost , scroll down .
look at the quote from &quot; max ... &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m sick of ashley and her tiger mom .
&quot; i say we give judge harper this sentence ...
death by lethal injection . &quot;
i hope writing death threats was worth it , max .
you &apos;re all are being very literal ,
and you have no right to search my locker .
we don &apos;t ?
the supreme court decided the need to maintain order
outweighs the privacy interests in students
in new jersey vs. t.l.o. ,
if , and only if , you have articulable facts .
you want &quot; articulable facts &quot; ?
i think he does , detective frost .
the comments you made constitute threats
sufficient to justify the search .
the supreme court also stated
that if the manner in which the search is conducted
is reasonably related to the objective , it &apos;s allowed .
wrong . i don &apos;t see a warrant , and i &apos;m not giving consent .
oh , that &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ve not only met the reasonable suspicion standard
but also the higher one ... probable cause .
that &apos;s sufficient to satisfy your 4th amendment concerns .
very nice , detective rizzoli .
thank you , detective frost .
your locker is messy , max .
whatever .
look . i &apos;ll admit i was pissed at judge harper .
i am much more qualified than ashley ,
but my mom isn &apos;t the advisor .
so you threatened judge harper with a lethal injection ,
and then you killed her .
right .
i &apos;m not stupid enough to kill a judge .
besides murder one looks kind of crappy on a transcript .
ritalin .
a drug offense looks pretty crappy , too .
it &apos;s not illegal to take ritalin .
it is if you don &apos;t have a prescription . do you got one ?
i want to cut a deal .
now we &apos;re talking .
i &apos;ll give up my dealer if you &apos;ll agree not to charge me
for an electronically communicated threat .
well , what if we want to charge you for murder , as well ?
i &apos;m the backup prosecutor . i never even left the courtroom .
want my dealer or not ?
i didn &apos;t sell ritalin to anybody .
i just gave a couple pills to a friend .
at least , i thought max was a friend .
i need to know where you got the ritalin , ashley .
ashley was diagnosed with adhd when she was 11 .
her pediatrician prescribed it to help her concentrate .
so how long have you been taking it ?
i don &apos;t anymore .
my daughter was worried
that ashley was retreating from her life
because she was embarrassed about the medication .
so she let her stop taking it .
how long ago was that ?
about seven months . right , honey ?
yeah .
so if you &apos;d stopped taking the ritalin ,
where did you get the pills to give to max ?
i found a bottle in mom &apos;s medicine cabinet .
ashley !
a lot of kids take ritalin .
you know how huge the workload in senior year ,
on top of college applications and mock trial ?
okay ...
i took some pills for me , and i gave some to max .
what a jerk .
thank you for telling me the truth .
why would somebody kill my mom ?
i don &apos;t know yet , but i want you to know
that it is very important to me to find out .
thank you .
i knew your mom .
she was a good person .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss , ashley .
and yours , mrs. phillips .
hey , dr. isles .
i &apos;m just reading a law review article
judge harper and roger thorson wrote
when they were at bcu ...
&quot; rehabilitation instead of retribution . &quot;
she was amazing .
thinking about the road not taken ?
what &apos;s the matter with your wrist ?
i &apos;ve had intermittent tingling and stingers
ever since i broke it in the parking @-@ garage collapse .
what did your doctor say ?
he sent me to a neurologist .
she said there wasn &apos;t any nerve damage .
well , that &apos;s good .
so why am i still having pain ?
i have a thought .
let me try something , but no guarantees .
i &apos;m ready to try anything .
except needles , because i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t like needles .
this won &apos;t hurt . i promise .
okay .
the large intestines , l.i. of 11,
on the affected side near to the left elbow .
ooh , what are you doing to him ?
acupuncture is supposed to be performed in a calm environment .
with all of your masks of death staring at him ?
they &apos;re tribal ritual masks .
you don &apos;t find them soothing ? um ...
not really .
should you be doing that ?
i &apos;m certified .
in acupuncture ?
i got perfect score on the n.c.c.a.o.m. exam in acupuncture
and on the foundations of traditional chinese medicine
and the clean needle technique .
all right , i &apos;m not busting you .
i &apos;m just asking . oh .
all right , give me an update on judge harper .
something interesting came back on her hair sample .
she &apos;d been taking ritalin for at least six months prior to her death .
did she have adhd like her daughter ?
well , there was no evidence of that in her medical history ,
and no doctor seems to have prescribed it for her .
i @-@ i don &apos;t mean to be a bad patient ,
but i &apos;ve stopped feeling calm .
okay .
the last one .
try not to move .
why was she taking ritalin ?
i don &apos;t know .
but there were significant levels
of inert excipients in her blood .
pill binders ?
yes . which wouldn &apos;t be present if taken orally .
so you &apos;re saying the killer injected her
with dissolved pills ?
yes .
look , jane , whoever did this had to have known she took ritalin
and tried to make it look accidental .
these are judge harper &apos;s medical records from law school .
i was curious about her dizzy spells
since they weren &apos;t alcohol @-@ related .
the injury to her patella occurred
between her second and third year ...
i wonder how she fractured it .
she was a runner . maybe she fell .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
she told the treating doctor
that she didn &apos;t remember falling .
he ordered a lumbar puncture .
aha ! her hypocretin levels were low .
why are we saying &quot; aha &quot; ?
well , it correlates
with the hla gene test i ordered .
judge harper fell because she blacked out .
she suffered from narcolepsy .
that &apos;s why she was taking ritalin .
yes .
okay , wait . why wasn &apos;t it in her medical records ,
and why didn &apos;t she have her own prescription ?
wait a minute . wait a minute .
judge harper clerked for judge juliet coker
when she was in law school .
excuse me .
yeah .
judge coker was tossed from the bench
when someone found out she was taking medication
for bipolar disorder and leaked it .
well , if she was taking medication ,
why was she removed ?
was there evidence that her condition affected her judgment ?
no . no , it wasn &apos;t about her condition .
she was a rising star .
the boys &apos; club wouldn &apos;t have liked that .
they used it to get rid of her .
so judge harper saw firsthand what happens
when your competitors
know your weaknesses and your medical history .
which is why she kept her narcolepsy a secret .
somebody knew .
oh , i can &apos;t today , angela .
i dipped into zorba &apos;s baklava at lunch .
i just tried to make my monthly electronic payment to the i.r.s.
frank sr. &apos; s back taxes ?
they told me that i have a zero balance .
you think frank paid it off ?
no .
my sources tell me he &apos;s completely broke .
was it you ?
i promised you i would not interfere , and i didn &apos;t .
well , then , maybe it was a clerical mistake .
when they find it , are they gonna throw me in jail ?
i &apos;m gonna have to tell them it &apos;s gonna take me
22 years to pay off that bill .
i might know someone i can call , find out what &apos;s up .
really ? thanks .
hey , ma .
hi , honey .
everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , of course .
i was just trying to give a brownie to sergeant korsak .
but he &apos;d rather have some carrots instead .
no charge .
thanks .
yeah .
i found something in judge harper &apos;s phone records ...
a guy named dustin williams
who &apos;s been calling her every day for weeks .
frost , can you check frankie &apos;s list ,
see if dustin williams was in the courthouse yesterday ?
yeah , but wait . how would he know that she took ritalin ?
did you check to see if he filed a formal complaint against her ?
he did .
dustin williams is on the list
and didn &apos;t leave the courthouse until 5 : 45 p.m.
you filed a formal complaint against judge harper .
to get justice for my son .
joey williams is your son ?
that &apos;s right .
he was convicted of burglary .
judge harper sentenced him to up to three years at starbridge .
why there ?
ask judge harper .
she &apos;s dead .
she said since joey was 17 and a first @-@ time offender ,
it would be a good place to turn his life around .
she put him with scum !
you seem pretty angry , mr. williams .
angry enough to kill a judge who sentenced your son ?
i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
then what were you doing at the courthouse yesterday ?
trying to get what i &apos;m entitled to ...
copies of joey &apos;s case file ,
so i could sue that hellhole of a prison .
joey didn &apos;t much like it there .
they extended his sentence .
they added four years .
what did he do ?
nothing !
they said he attacked someone , but that wasn &apos;t joey .
he was scared out of his mind .
i begged judge harper to get him out of there .
is that why you kept calling her ?
she said she believed he didn &apos;t deserve that extension .
she said she &apos;d look into it .
did she ?
she didn &apos;t do a damn thing .
it &apos;s because of her my son &apos;s dead .
when did he die ?
last week .
prison gave me some bullshit story about kidney failure ,
but joey never had any problem with his kidneys .
and you blame judge harper for that ?
hell yeah .
she put him in there .
i bet she was taking kickbacks .
you go ahead , arrest me . charge me with her murder .
i &apos;ll confess , as long as you look into my son &apos;s death .
judge &apos;s financials are clear .
i knew she wasn &apos;t taking kickbacks .
she wasn &apos;t that kind of person .
dad &apos;s alibi checks out .
clerk &apos;s office said he showed up at 4 : 30
and refused to leave without his son &apos;s file .
court security hauled him out at 5 : 45 .
judge harper believed in rehabilitation .
is that why she sent joey to starbridge ?
can you pull up their website ?
got it .
nice prison ... a library , classrooms ,
basketball court , computer room .
it &apos;s minimum security .
yeah . mostly first @-@ time offenders .
an 18 % recidivism rate ? that &apos;s low .
starbridge should run all the prisons
if they can turn 82 % of their inmates into solid citizens .
frost , pull up starbridge &apos;s financials .
they showed record profits in the last two quarters .
must be a big place .
every prison gets paid by the prisoner .
let &apos;s look at anyone judge harper sentenced there .
every one of them was a first @-@ time offender .
jane , they all had their sentences extended .
for the same thing . look . it says &quot; behavior violations . &quot;
same as joey williams .
the extensions file in her briefcase ...
she was checking into joey &apos;s extended sentence ,
and somebody took the contents of that file .
i have joey williams &apos; autopsy reports from starbridge .
i checked it against all of his medical records .
he has a blood condition ... benign familial erythrocytosis .
what &apos;s that mean ?
well , his red @-@ blood @-@ cell count was consistently elevated ,
but his autopsy cbc blood test
showed no signs of elevation .
that &apos;s not possible .
yeah , it is .
it wasn &apos;t joey &apos;s blood .
judge harper had a daughter that was 17 .
she cared about teenagers . joey was 17 .
she was looking into starbridge . we need to go there .
it &apos;s a private prison .
they &apos;re not just gonna let you poke around .
they might . if they think we &apos;re all on the same side .
do you know this dustin williams guy ?
better than i &apos;d like to .
us , too ... he &apos;s been raising holy hell at the station .
he &apos;s even asked dr. isles here
to exhume his son &apos;s body to do another autopsy .
he &apos;s like a bad penny , that one .
we need got to him off our back .
yeah . so just give us the 25 @-@ cent tour ,
and we will sign off on this thing
and finally be rid of that nut ball .
nothing would make me happier .
fantastic .
&quot; starbridge : do your time , cross the bridge to a better life . &quot;
we try to make a difference .
that &apos;s why we only take minimum @-@ security offenders .
how do you manage such a low recidivism rate ?
we have a lot to offer ...
classes to get your high @-@ school g.e.d. ,
college courses , counseling , fitness center .
we &apos;ve got it all .
uh , we would love to see where you house the prisoners .
oh , that &apos;s off limits , even to the good guys .
sorry .
no problem .
jane , are you all right ?
no .
oh , no . uh , you know , she has terrible dysmenorrhea .
do you have ladies &apos; room ?
uh , there &apos;s only one .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s all the way
on the other side of the facility .
i need that one !
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna ... i &apos;m gonna come with you , detective .
excuse us .
jane ...
did ever have a female partner ?
no .
what a pain in the ass .
you &apos;re telling me .
where did you get that card ?
i borrowed it .
this is making me very itchy .
i &apos;ll get you some benadryl . all right , come on .
we got to figure out what happened to joey .
go .
there &apos;s four people to a one @-@ man cell .
are those gang tattoos ?
yeah , hard @-@ core gangbangers .
they &apos;re not first @-@ time offenders .
and this definitely isn &apos;t minimum security .
&quot; monday and friday &quot; ?
well , how could a prison offer inmates access to medical care
for only six hours a week ?
dig deep . find his records .
staphylococcus bacteria must be teeming in here ,
along with e. coli .
don &apos;t start again .
here it is . here it is .
joseph williams &apos; medical records .
frost ?
hit me .
get into the bureau of prisons database .
okay .
pull up a listing of all starbridge inmates .
what are you looking for ?
sort for longest to shortest sentences , and then start reading .
okay .
&quot; murder one , murder one , second @-@ degree murder . &quot;
a lot of those .
&quot; assault with a deadly weapon . &quot;
lots of those . and lots of rapes .
does that sound like a place
to send a 17 @-@ year @-@ old first @-@ time burglar ?
i &apos;m surprised the kid lasted as long as he did .
jane ...
joey williams didn &apos;t die of kidney failure .
you sure ?
well , i &apos;d prefer to do an autopsy .
i &apos;d prefer to be in hawaii . what does it say in his report ?
okay , look , what starbridge reported to the state
conflicts with his chart .
he had elevated blood co2 levels .
that &apos;s consistent with suffocation , not kidney failure .
it would be in starbridge &apos;s interest to cover up a prison murder
to keep their contract with the state .
judge harper must have pressed starbridge
after joey &apos;s death .
i think we just found motive .
jane , there &apos;s ritalin here .
it &apos;s korsak .
warden &apos;s on high alert , looking for us ...
frost , did you find judge harper
on yesterday &apos;s courthouse footage ?
i wasn &apos;t looking for her , but i can .
okay . jane , let &apos;s go .
okay . track her .
i want to know everyone that she talked to yesterday .
okay . korsak is texting me . now , come on .
we need to get out of here .
frost , i got to go . bye .
i thought i was gonna have to visit you at starbridge .
oh . we should have called .
how did you get away from the warden ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
yeah , i do .
i said i needed a tampon .
worked like a charm .
i &apos;ve found something , jane .
judge harper and roger thorson had coffee together .
yeah , uh , they went over the mock trial . he told us about it .
but something happened between them . watch .
that &apos;s quite a disagreement .
zoom in on that file folder .
it &apos;s the &quot; extensions &quot; folder .
so she was talking about joey &apos;s sentence extension .
why are they arguing ?
wait , frost , stop . go back .
what &apos;s on that paper she &apos;s showing him ?
it &apos;s a complaint to the office of bar counsel .
judge harper wanted someone disbarred .
who ? hit &quot; play . &quot;
well , whatever he said made her rip up that complaint .
what do we know about roger thorson ?
they were friends , went to law school together .
they even co @-@ wrote articles for the &quot; law review . &quot;
he &apos;s a corporate attorney now .
does he have any connection to starbridge ?
checking .
his firm represents them .
who else does he represent ?
no one .
okay . so , he gave judge harper the sales job on starbridge .
that &apos;s why she was sentencing first @-@ time offenders there .
she thought they were on the same side .
the &quot; law review &quot; article you were reading ...
&quot; rehabilitation instead of retribution . &quot;
she learned too late that roger had sold out .
tens of millions of dollars at stake with a private prison .
wait , it ... it wasn &apos;t just about the money .
she was threatening to get him
disbarred with the complaint that she tore up .
he &apos;d lose everything .
keep watching . look what he &apos;s doing now .
emptying the &quot; extensions &quot; folder .
and taking a manila envelope .
the law clerk said the judge came back for something .
permission slips ! that &apos;s why she left the courtroom .
well , you &apos;re not allowed to start the competition
until you &apos;ve turned in all the kids &apos; permission slips .
let &apos;s get a warrant .
detectives , approach , please .
thank you , your honor . are those the permission slips ?
any news ? the kids are just about to come in
to finish the mock @-@ trial competition .
yeah , i have some news , roger ,
starting with the permission slips
that you took from judge harper &apos;s briefcase .
i &apos;m sorry ?
she left them in the courtroom .
no .
you convinced her that she left them in her office .
that way you could start the competition .
everyone was watching ashley .
no one noticed you slip out ,
and you waited for judge harper in the stairwell ,
and then you injected her with ritalin .
you &apos;re out of your mind !
i tried to save her . i gave her cpr .
yeah , you had to think fast .
what if she had been able to talk , roger ?
that must have shocked the
hell out of you when she made it back here .
you knew about her narcolepsy diagnosis , knew she took ritalin .
this is obscene .
yes , it is .
we executed a search warrant at your house .
we found paint from the stairwell
and fibers from the judge &apos;s dress
on the suit you were wearing .
of course you did !
i was trying to start her heart . she was my friend .
and you made sure you
touched her in case you were ever a suspect .
that &apos;s not true !
no ?
since when did cpr require a syringe filled with ritalin ?
what syringe ? oh , the supposed murder weapon ?
do you have that ? did you ...
did you recover it when you tore apart my house ?
i &apos;m sure you disposed of it .
luckily , you carried that syringe out of the courthouse
in your suit pocket .
we found traces of ritalin and her blood
on your clothes .
vince .
my friend at the i.r.s. confirms it .
your debt is paid off .
oh , i feel like i just got my life back !
he &apos;s not supposed to be drinking .
it &apos;s a soda .
hey , everyone , next round &apos;s on me !
you , too , jane . and , of course , you , too , maura .
what are you doing , tommy ?
i &apos;m celebrating .
my case against the storrow center settled .
oh , tommy !
tommy , hey . listen ...
maybe it &apos;s best that you don &apos;t spend your money like this .
ma , i want you to stop worrying , okay ,
about me , and now you can stop worrying about , you know ,
your financial issues .
tommy , you didn &apos;t .
didn &apos;t what ?
you paid off her debt ?
you paid off the i.r.s. ?
$ 27,000 ?
how do you two know ? !
vince ?
don &apos;t look at me .
i didn &apos;t say a word .
uh ... well ... we ...
no . i. i ... wa ...
it was just a long story ...
i told them .
look , you shouldn &apos;t have to do everything on your own .
they wanted to help , just like me .
oh , come here , tommy . thank you .
ma , i can &apos;t breathe .
listen ... i &apos;m gonna pay you every penny , son .
i promise ... with interest .
ma , look . i owe you plenty .
no , i ...
i &apos;m proud of you , tommy .
you &apos;re the man that pop never was .
you don &apos;t have to get all mushy on me , jane .
well , i can if i want to ! oh , i love you so much .
i love you . and listen , okay .
you are not allowed to do this on your own , all right ?
frankie and i will split it with you .
thanks , jane .
well , listen , since we &apos;re all hugging here ,
