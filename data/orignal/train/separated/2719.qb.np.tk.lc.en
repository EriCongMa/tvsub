what the fuck ?
aw , shit !
so , bundino ,
why you fuck me like this ?
what the fuck you talkin &apos; about ?
i got a whole leg covered with neosporin .
i just spent an hour with the cops explainin &apos; how it went down .
i no forget you professional criminal .
let me ask you somethin &apos; .
if i really wanted to rob you , you think i &apos;d have to put up with this bullshit ?
well , just so you know .
i didn &apos;t take your truck .
i lost my study guide , my fuckin &apos; flashcards .
i &apos;m sick of this fuckin &apos; prejudice against ex @-@ cons .
i never hire you if i no need tony soprano for union .
not for him , i show you the fucking window .
great .
hey , i thought you liked the other one .
the corn pops . here , take it .
what , no juice either ?
i told you , write it down.i &apos;ll have the girl pick up whatever you want .
she doesn &apos;t know the difference between fruit roll @-@ ups and pop @-@ tarts .
i know , everybody &apos;s an idiot to you .
you know they got these places called supermarkets
where you go , and you buy the things that you like .
i &apos;ll reimburse you .
and when am i supposed to do that ?
well , as far as i can tell , you spend most of your time on the phone
or sittin &apos; on the couch perfecting that pissy look on your face .
add coming home drunk , sounds like you .
what the fuck did you say to me ?
let the fuck go of me .
or what ? or what ?
one of these days , you wait ,
i &apos;m gonna kick your fuckin &apos; ass .
what &apos;s wrong with right now then what &apos;s wrong with right now ?
come on !
now you got nothin &apos; .
thank you , mary .
you &apos;re welcome .
i hated to call you in but i got this midterm report
from mr. fiske , anthony &apos;s english teacher .
and , uh , well , it doesn &apos;t hit the mail for a few days
and i thought maybe we could get a jump on it and avert any real crisis .
wonderful , another crisis .
he &apos;s still well below the c average he needs for the colleges we discussed .
there is also an issue with his five paragraph essay .
&quot; animal farm &quot; ?
anthony submitted his one @-@ line topic late .
then two drafts .
the first was apparently sketchy .
the second , fiske said , was ... &quot; suspiciously cogent . &quot;
plagiarism.he thinks my son cheated ?
he spent almost an entire saturday afternoon at the library .
i think it &apos;s obvious what &apos;s going on .
what do you mean ?
anyone else shows sudden improvement , he gets a gold star .
my son gets his act together and suddenly he &apos;s a cheater ?
i know what people think , bob .
italian @-@ american , father in the carting industry ...
are you suggesting some sort of bias ?
because that &apos;s a very serious charge .
i have met this mr. fiske . he &apos;s a cold fish .
couldn &apos;t you or one of the other teachers talk to him ?
tell him how hard aj &apos;s trying ?
nothing will make a better argument than continued effort on aj &apos;s part .
but hey , there ... there &apos;s still a shot .
this semester &apos;s grade is heavily weighted on their
term paper on &quot; lord of the flies . &quot;
my stomach is in knots .
that &apos;s why i thought it important that you come in.though it ...
did take me about an hour to decide what to wear .
me too .
does that mean you &apos;ve thought about my dinner offer ?
i probably shouldn &apos;t say this
but i have thought about nothing else since you called.well , we can &apos;t do justice
to any discussion of &quot; madame bovary &quot; over the phone .
that &apos;s the thing though . that book was way over my head .
why would you even be interested in someone like me ?
because of just that . i mean , who admits this stuff ?
not only are you very attractive , you &apos;re unpretentious ,
you say what &apos;s on your mind .
so a big mouth.i see how that would attract a man like you .
so , should we grab a meal or not ?
well , there are other things to think about .
my husband for one .
your husband &apos;s gonna have to get used to the idea that your life is moving on .
i &apos;m not worried about my life .
you know what ? call me naive ,
but in this day and age i don &apos;t really think your husband ...
if he found out ... is going to break his son &apos;s teacher &apos;s legs .
not to mention how that would play in the admissions office at arizona state .
i don &apos;t get it . what &apos;s so funny about that ?
honey , aren &apos;t you gonna eat something ?
janice made lasagna .
it &apos;s not so great but you need something on your stomach .
we &apos;re gonna go . got to stop at my mother &apos;s .
gwen just told us how you met.they let you use the internet in the can ?
they let you post an ad .
i got to read some of that shit . i bet it &apos;s hysterical .
he &apos;s , uh ... trying to concentrate .
&quot; vascular physiology . &quot; &quot; neurotomy . &quot;
t made it out like it was a big gym test .
some people don &apos;t realize what massage involves .
i &apos;m practically doin &apos; two years of medical school on my own right now .
one thing i learned in recovery , other people &apos;s definitions of you ,
sometimes they &apos;re more about makin&apos;
themselves feel better . you got to define yourself .
keep your eye on the tiger , man .
see you , tony .
bye .
i suppose i could speak with monsignor bava ,
have him call his nephew at kmart .
that &apos;ll fix us in the huggies department .
well , the diaper drive covers &quot; clothe the naked . &quot;
what do you say we work on &quot; feed the hungry &quot; ?
this looks delicious .
thanks for inviting me , carm .
pleasant surprise , indeed .
so , how goes life these days ?
actually ,
i think i met somebody .
really ?
just kind of happened .
we had been working on this project together
and suddenly we both realized that there were certain feelings .
and i like him as a person too , of course.don &apos;t get me wrong .
the funny thing is , i was sure he was gay.he sort of reminded me of you .
he &apos;s an intellectual . you know what i mean ?
anyway , we had been friends , i guess ,
and then he called to ask me out .
and suddenly all the formality dropped away .
when i saw him the other day ,
he looked at me with this intensity .
now i know it &apos;s wrong , but the truth is , i feel it too .
you know , if you really want to discuss this ,
i think we should include tony in the conversation as well .
why are you sounding , i don &apos;t know , kind of hostile ?
i &apos;m not .
perhaps that &apos;s your sin talking .
this is none of tony &apos;s business .
who knows what he &apos;s been up to , and not just during the separation either .
that doesn &apos;t change the fact you made a commitment to each other before god .
maybe you should send the papal nuncio to tony and remind him of that .
why am i the only one held to any kind of standards ?
and for that matter , if this is wrong ,
why did god put this man in my life ?
is it god that put him there ?
or is there a particular need you have right now ?
see , i never understand this.didn &apos;t he put the need there ?
say when ,
you ! office !
5 : 15 , i haven &apos;t punched in yet . this is still my time .
yeah ? i give you a hard time about my truck the other day .
cops find two kids ...
feel free to apologize any time .
anyway , they investigate .
could be joyride .
but i think maybe behind it is my cousin in the north side .
you know if they found my books ?
who knows ?
you study hard for massage , yeah ?
the licensing test is pretty hard . huge failure rate .
if you pass , then what you do with this ?
be a professional masseur .
you no think of massage &quot; kageh &quot; ? you know , small sauna .
yeah , i could see it.four or five tables , soothing atmosphere .
pipe in a little keith jarrett .
first thing , i get stuck with you . i think ,
&quot; oh , shit . god damn it.he lazy american and criminal .
no good for kim . &quot;
but you work for kim and future .
like korean people .
i wouldn &apos;t say that.i come from korea .
only new shoes and uncle &apos;s address.worse than prison .
but i become &quot; jah @-@ soo @-@ suhng @-@ gah , &quot; the boss .
that &apos;s why i try to help you .
help me how ? what are you talking about ?
i stake you the money in a storefront .
i got a travel agency
in mini @-@ mall over at west caldwell .
shitty business with a fucking three @-@ year lease .
you know , my daughter , very interested in massage .
physical therapy . top two @-@ thirds class .
good for her . it &apos;s a tough nut to crack .
she no like physical therapy no more .
cripple people make her sad .
now , she watch tv , live at home , do nothing .
you pass test then you , me , my daughter , we make the big success journey .
okay ?
yeah , all right .
i don &apos;t know what to say , kim.thanks.
i laid it out for him . he wants to move back here .
it &apos;s got to be with your approval
this was your idea ?
it was mutual .
he &apos;s upset &apos; cause you don &apos;t get the kind of cereal he likes .
he threw it in the sink . how am i supposed to focus
at school with no breakfast ? i got dizzy .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t see why the two of you can &apos;t work this out between yourselves .
well maybe
i don &apos;t want to live in a place where people use violence against children .
violence ? you &apos;re lucky i didn &apos;t put my shoe up your ass .
you see ? now that &apos;s abuse . i know what my rights are .
i can call social services
and they &apos;ll send a case worker .
go ahead ! he &apos;ll get the other shoe !
this is demoralizin &apos; .
well , now maybe you see ...
that a son of mine would even consider callin &apos; in the authorities !
go ahead , live where you want .
fine .
family meeting ?
try to stay awake , aj .
keep walkin &apos; .
i just want my old room back .
you wanted to live with your father . live with your decision .
i don &apos;t like it there .
funny ,
i thought i was the problem.- i make you miserable , remember ?
i never said that.- you did .
absolutely .
for me to even consider having you back ,
we &apos;re gonna have to establish some non @-@ negotiable ground rules .
like what kind ?
let your mother talk .
first and foremost , school comes first .
that means putting the brakes on your social life ...
parties , phone calls , devin .
you are at a crisis point grade @-@ wise ,
so you will make sure that your work is done on time and correctly .
all right.i will not tolerate cursing .
after 16 years of uninterrupted potty mouth from you people , i get slammed ?
this is my house . you will treat me with respect .
is that it ?
i want you to involve me in your life a little .
all right , fine .
all right . go get your stuff from the car .
we played that just right .
i think his time over there with me whipped him into shape a little .
i think you &apos;ll see a difference .
which muscles attach to the coracoid process ?
okay , i fucking know this .
it &apos;s on the tip of my tongue .
oh , fucking study hall again .
vito , where the fuck is my tupperware ?
keep your shirt on . my wife &apos;s bringing it down this afternoon .
pectoralis minor and the coracobrachialis , of course .
and ?
come on . even i know this .
fuck , fine , what is it ?
fuck , fine , what is it ? - biceps !
what the fuck ? oh , fuck , i knew that
my mind &apos;s all over the place .
fear knocked at the door . faith answered .
there was no one there .
why do you want to do this shit ?
so you can touch a bunch a strangers ?
you really skeeve the human body , don &apos;t you ?
you like this so much , let me ask you a question .
why do pissing , shitting and fucking all happen within a two @-@ inch radius ?
everybody asks that , paulie . there &apos;s no answer for it .
they &apos;re all sources of pleasure , though.get the fuck out of here !
i know this shit and then the next minute it &apos;s gone .
i don &apos;t know how you do it working full time .
if your parole officer &apos;s a problem , give our guy jimmy curran a call .
he &apos;s a supervisor.it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s all this pressure now that i got this opportunity .
sungyon kim , my boss ,
he &apos;s going to back me on a whole storefront operation .
the korean ?
you &apos;re looking for money , why not come to me ?
well , this is different .
this self @-@ owned business shit is like a religion to these people .
plus , the guy sees something in me .
you know , in some ways , the whole prison thing is not that different
from being an immigrant .
word to the wise
remember pearl harbor .
we really were the last people in there .
at least they were subtle about it .
was it the stacking the chairs or running the vacuum ?
relax.sorry.
&quot; madame bovary . &quot; it &apos;s a first edition .
well , modern library &apos;s first edition .
thank you . that is so sweet .
honestly , though , i don &apos;t know .
the story &apos;s very slow.nothing really happens .
i think he could &apos;ve said what he has to say with a lot less words
outside nothing happens .
but inside she has these extremes of boredom and exhilaration .
you should try it again .
and what a wonderful thing to have in a den .
you know , you look really beautiful in this light .
i don &apos;t do this a lot .
do what ?
sitting in a car , with a man ,
not really knowing what to do ,
or if i should at all .
and feeling like some teenager which was , believe it or not ...
i have to tell you .
i haven &apos;t been with anyone .
you &apos;re a virgin ? this is my lucky night .
stop with the jokes .
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
so , how was it ?
oh , cut it out .
so , what is &quot; abelard and heloise &quot; ? it looks religious .
i just like to read in there .
it &apos;s the classic story .
a 12th century scholar falls in love with his underage student ,
gets her pregnant.god , in the 12th century ?
and they &apos;re found out .
and her uncle , the abbot , has him castrated .
it &apos;s timeless , really .
even though he becomes a monk and she a nun ,
their passion burns on through
these incredible letters through the rest of their lives .
you , with these books .
education should never stop .
it enriches all aspects of life .
hmm , i know .
i wish someone could convince aj of that .
i keep thinking he could start over in college
but who knows if he &apos;s even going to get the chance ?
he will . all our students matriculate .
you got to be fucking kidding me .
no way !
why do they take so long ? all they have to do is spit out the results .
5 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 4 @-@ 7 @-@ 3 @-@ 7 @-@ 32 @-@ 11 .
that &apos;s me . blundetto.i &apos;m only authorized to inform you that your score
meets or exceeds the required minimum for licensure .
and you &apos;re now board
certified in massage and body work by the state of new jersey .
honey , you passed.you passed !
oh jesus.i couldn &apos;t have done it alone .
oh my god , look at you .
you did it , baby.you did it .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
it &apos;s been a month since my last confession .
carmela ?
i had sex with that man .
i know we talked about commitment ,
the sacrament of marriage , but ...
i don &apos;t know.you sound remorseful
i am.i &apos;m also confused , though .
the truth is i have been walking around on a cloud ,
like maria in &quot; west side story . &quot;
it &apos;s not right .
have you heard of &quot; abelard and eloise &quot; ?
i think it &apos;s &quot; heloise . &quot;
and from what i remember it ends badly .
i know , exactly .
but , something in me has been reawakened .
and even if it never happens again with this man ,
just knowing that feeling of passion again ,
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s ever going to go away.i &apos;ll need it .
if it never happens again ?
carmela , i can &apos;t absolve you of a sin you &apos;re going to continue to commit .
you need to show resolve , a firm purpose to change .
yeah , i know , i know.so , this man takes you to restaurants ,
fulfills certain physical desires ,
tells jokes.but will he be there beyond the here and now ?
when you &apos;re too old to walk to the bathroom , will he be there to help you ?
what , and you think tony will ?
carmela , you took a vow .
you both did .
for your penance , i want you to do something kind for tony .
i don &apos;t think i can , father .
then pray for him ,
not only that god will touch his heart
but that he &apos;ll touch yours as well .
it &apos;s not much now , but it &apos;s a pretty flexible space .
plus you got the dog groomer next door in case
your korean friend wants some lunch .
you know they really do eat dogs.- not all of them but i asked kim .
jesus christ .
i &apos;m thinking of building a row of rooms here
with different themes . asian for shiatsu ,
a little danish thing for rolfing , even though technically it &apos;s swedish .
well , sounds like it &apos;s all coming together .
look , ton &apos; , i know you &apos;re disappointed .
what the fuck you talking about ?
the way things turned out since i left the can.going civilian .
over here i &apos;m going to put an oasis with big plants .
like a waiting area for the customers .
they could buy some $ 30 hand cream while they
look at one of those fountains with the koi in it .
i can get you the koi . - really , giant carp ?
how the fuck do you get that ?
it &apos;s done . don &apos;t give it another thought .
tony , you here ?
up front .
hey . i came by to get the keys .
i would have gone by the laundry but my dad &apos;s such a hard @-@ on at work .
tell me about it . amanda , this is my cousin tony .
hey . - hey , how are you ?
hey , do you believe there &apos;s a dog groomer there
in case somebody needs a snack ?
place is nice . a little paint , maybe ...
amanda , this is my cousin christopher .
hey .
so , i met this guy at a club on canal .
he says he can hook us up with ginseng , fake rhino ,
nerve tea , all that herbal shit .
we could keep it up front with the koi thing.- if we &apos;re still doing that .
koi &apos;s taken care of .
well , i got to book . nice meeting you guys .
what &apos;s she here for , happy endings ?
she &apos;s not going to do massage at all.she &apos;s kim &apos;s daughter .
she &apos;s trying to find herself.she &apos;ll do the books and shit .
oh . nice ass .
those ceiling tiles come right out so i can install the sound system myself .
think you could put in a word with number one daughter there ?
for what ?
get some of that kung pao kootchie .
you fucking guys , this is important to me .
sex agrees with you . you look great .
you &apos;re being discreet , right ?
well , sneaking around is actually half the fun .
it &apos;s like you have this secret , you know , you want to scream to the world .
yeah , but do yourself a favor , though , yeah .
so , how was it ?
uh , i will say that he took his time .
oh , you &apos;re not getting off that easy.come on , details .
hello there .
hey , aj .
hey , aunt ro .
how was school ?
it sucked .
mr. wegler pulled me out of language lab to go over my term paper notes .
i didn &apos;t have my stuff with me
so he puts his faggy hand on my shoulder and says &quot; do your best . &quot;
that &apos;s his job , to get you into college .
or maybe he &apos;s just a big homo .
could be . i &apos;m making ziti for dinner .
go start your assignments . i will call you .
could i watch tv first ? promise me you &apos;re going to work later .
but you got to help me .
i will .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry , my jackie .
oh , honey .
they never caught those goddamn chinks who killed him .
oh my god . it hurts .
so i &apos;m finding the other copy when
gene the actuary
completely unloads on me
jerk .
like yelling is going to make me do anything but screw up more .
you know you have to remember that when you &apos;re the boss .
the boss . it &apos;s amazing , isn &apos;t it ?
jerks . garbage pails are right there .
come on .
holy fuck !
what ? !
oh my god , is it a fetus ?
it &apos;s crack , or crank maybe .
they were drug dealers ?
yeah , they were probably thinking they were being tailed by the cops .
honey , your parole .
happy ? come on .
i have never seen that much money before .
there &apos;s got to be 10 @-@ 12 grand .
look at this . you &apos;re doubly blessed .
you &apos;re right . kim , now this .
i am going to buy you a ring .
you are the sweetest , sweetest man .
but you should put it into the business.see , i got to start thinking like that .
it &apos;s a learning curve .
well , it seems to say here
that this piggy represents intellectualism over the physical .
so maybe the eyeglasses are symbolic .
and that &apos;s a good topic for section two in your outline .
aj ! wake up !
i &apos;m not going to do this by myself .
how are you going to finish this paper ? it &apos;s not going to write itself .
so now this so @-@ called bag ,
you sure it wasn &apos;t on some old lady &apos;s arm ?
i can &apos;t believe she thought it was a baby .
people do that shit .
12 grand ? madonn &apos; mi &apos; .
how many guys you got to jerk off on a massage table to make that ?
i don &apos;t know . what do you charge without the table ?
cristal , gentlemen ? keep it coming , honey .
from now on , anytime somebody steps in a pile a shit ,
it &apos;ll be known as a blundetto .
to the blundetto !
i &apos;m sorry .
i wasn &apos;t ready .
my god , you scared me.what are you doing here ?
jesus . nice greeting .
how are you ? everything okay ?
aj left this in his room.thought he might need it to turn in .
did you even look at this ? who the hell is anne dunham ?
how the hell should i know ?
well , she &apos;s obviously
some girl who was an expert on &quot; lord of the flies &quot; three years ago .
this is an a @-@ plus paper .
since when do you eat duck ?
i can &apos;t believe he would do this .
neither can i , considering how tight he is with money .
that &apos;s not what i meant . you think he bought this ?
god damn it !
hello ? hi , i was just laying here thinking about you .
what are you wearing ?
yes , hello , mr. wegler . i &apos;m afraid now is not a good time .
i &apos;m serious . i want to know .
uh , well , yes . thank you very much.i will make sure that he brings it in .
okay . goodbye , mr. wegler .
i made reservations at that crab place down by the shore .
dinner and a little night swimming .
right , okay . thank you .
what did that fag want ?
jesus christ , tony , everybody &apos;s a fag to you .
maybe you &apos;re a fag , you ever think about that ?
can i help it if i know one when i see one ?
really ? what are the signs ... education , culture ?
sucking a guy &apos;s cock usually tips me off .
how do you know who sucks whose cock ? you got a little secret ?
and what do you care , anyway , if somebody &apos;s gay ?
it must be some big fear of yours or you wouldn &apos;t talk about it so much .
i forget now . what part of hell did you say they go to ?
are they with the abortion doctors or the child molesters ?
that was a long time ago . - now you &apos;re all open @-@ minded
that you got a couple of
friends that are bologna smokers .
right ?
what the fuck are you doing ? going for a swim .
would you leave your goddamn socks here ?
your underpants ?
hey , that &apos;s some beautiful suit .
i had to get it . it went with the shoes .
whose got those ? vito &apos;s guy ?
vasily &apos;s , custom @-@ made .
only thing i ever found in the street is my first wife .
dealer has 20.son of a bitch .
i just took a beating at craps.i just took a beating at craps .
pocahontas here is scalping us .
what &apos;s the matter ?
just nothing . i don &apos;t know .
i just keep thinking about aj and that girl &apos;s paper .
oh , it &apos;s a pretty common thing , carm , really .
honestly , you know , the important thing is you took a stand .
a lot of parents just take it in stride , or even condone it .
it &apos;s just the cheating , you know .
it &apos;s just not like him . he &apos;s always done his work .
poorly , a lot of the time ,
and late but he always did it , he never cheated .
well , wait .
didn &apos;t i read somewhere in his record that he stole a test at verbum dei ?
please , no , that was just acting out . he was with a bad crowd .
they were there to vandalize the science lab ,
but it was locked , so they stole some tests .
well , i was a late bloomer too .
union college took a chance on me
because they saw that i had potential , but i wasn &apos;t that mature .
that &apos;s all this is . aj &apos;s just fighting to keep peace with
the kids who seem further ahead .
you know , you ask me , i think he was driven to cheating .
it &apos;s that @-@ that mr. fiske . he is ridiculous with the pressure .
i mean , how hopeless would you feel if you really
worked on something and still got a &quot; d &quot; ?
i have been there , carm . you &apos;re worrying for nothing , i promise .
i have thought about this all day .
you know i almost called you from the faculty parking lot .
oh , bob .
what ?
stop . bob , i ...
what &apos;s the matter ?
i can &apos;t right now , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m too upset .
carmela , stay.what are you doing ?
what kind of mother am i ? i mean , look at us .
do you realize under the laws of the church i am still married ?
the church ?
i can &apos;t do this tonight.i &apos;m sorry
jesus , carmela , come on .
okay , thanks . it was a fucking blast .
you sure you don &apos;t want to eat ? steak and eggs up by skyway &apos;s .
oh , i can &apos;t .
come on , shut the door .
i &apos;m going to mange then hit the sack for the next 14 hours .
hey , i thought once they move you upstairs you get to leave early .
no such luck . got a second ?
the soprano kid.how is he doing ? got his paper yet ?
well , the usual.solidly below average .
so what , a &quot; c &quot; ?
well no , that &apos;s a little generous
for 10 % insight , - 90 % cliff notes .
this is an important class , tom .
anything less than a &quot; c &quot; is going to blow that kid out at arizona state .
you think it &apos;s going to make a difference ?
as dean of college admissions and head of your
department , i happen to know it &apos;s a fact .
he &apos;s doing his best .
well , like my dad used to say , &quot; the world needs ditch diggers too . &quot;
let me ask you something .
how is floating this kid a c @-@ minus going to fuck things up here ?
aj soprano &apos;s a spoiled lox .
he &apos;d be lucky to go to a trade school .
it &apos;s a d @-@ plus .
tom , cut him a break .
so what does it mean to the kid who really breaks his ass in here
if fredo corleone can get a &quot; c &quot; &apos; cause you asked ?
is that what this is about ? his background ?
good night.i &apos;ll be working over at the place .
that &apos;s good dedication.way to go .
see , regular people need a place to relax too .
they can &apos;t just hop on a plane to the bahamas , right ?
hey , guys , what do you think of daddy &apos;s business ?
jason , justin , i &apos;m talking to you .
i like it .
yeah , it &apos;s nice .
maybe someday when this thing takes off
you guys can work here , like as a summer job or something .
