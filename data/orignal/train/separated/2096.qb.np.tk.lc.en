turn around .
slowly .
get up .
what are you doing with that ?
i &apos;ll get hpd down here , process the place .
no .
don &apos;t bother .
they &apos;re not going to find anything .
the guys wore gloves .
what are you eating ?
nothing . ice , for your head .
i &apos;m fine .
don &apos;t be a tough guy , okay ?
i &apos;ve been popped with a stun gun before .
it &apos;s no fun . ice helps .
you &apos;ve been stun gunned ?
yes , i &apos;ve been stunned . hoboken , halloween &apos; 02 .
it &apos;s a long story i don &apos;t want to tell you right now .
how many guys were there ?
three .
three . okay , good , &apos; cause i was wondering how
one little burglar comes in and takes advantage
of a navy seal .
they weren &apos;t burglars , okay ?
they were professionals , they were organized and precise .
yeah , the stun guns , gloves , they knew exactly
what they were after . there &apos;s no doubt you were targeted .
yeah , targeted i understand .
but how &apos;d they get you ? did you not put
an alarm system in here after the general pak thing ?
i told you to do that . i don &apos;t want to be a nag ,
but i did say you should do that .
i put it in , okay ?
they made a clean entry .
they didn &apos;t trip the sensors , i don &apos;t understand .
nothing was tripped because they hacked your system
using the alarm company &apos;s servers .
they disarmed it as if you did it yourself .
did you find out where they came in ?
yeah . there are boot prints leading up to
and away from the back door ,
but there are no signs of forced entry .
all the windows are secure , too .
if they broke in , i can &apos;t tell where .
they take anything other than your father &apos;s tool box ?
no .
but my father &apos;s entire investigation
into my mother &apos;s murder was in that box .
all right , i &apos;m not a rocket scientist , but that is
the reason the jackers were in here , they wanted that evidence .
how did they know about the evidence ?
i didn &apos;t mention it to anyone .
when i called hpd archives to get the accident report ,
i just asked for a file number .
did you guys mention the champ box
to anybody at all ? anybody ?
no .
no .
and you never talked about it with anyone else ?
i talked to the people in this room .
and my sister .
i talked to my sister .
hi , it &apos;s mary . leave me a message .
something &apos;s wrong .
do me a favor , please . will you not go there ?
okay ? you don &apos;t know anything . maybe she went out last night .
maybe she got a little goofy , she &apos;s sleeping it off .
and let me be honest about something ,
if , first thing in the morning , i see your face pop on my phone ,
i might not answer it either .
they didn &apos;t break into the house , danny .
and the only other person
who has a key to the house is mary .
mary , you in there ?
mary , it &apos;s steve .
mary .
whole house is clear .
maybe mary was never here . huh ?
maybe they just ransacked the place .
she was here .
i got blood .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s a tooth .
mary &apos;s .
i hope not .
whoever took the box took mary .
any word from hpd ?
nothing yet . there &apos;s an apb out on mary ,
and kono &apos;s canvassing the neighbors
just in case anyone heard or saw anything .
all right . this from the crime lab ?
yeah . i had them rush the blood and tooth analysis .
now , these results are just preliminary ,
but the good news is
they look like they came from the same person : male .
okay .
no hits in the system , though .
what about her cell phone ? we didn &apos;t find it at the scene .
yeah , i pulled her records
looking for any anomalies in the call history .
there &apos;s only one that looked out of place .
that was to a surf rental stand in waikiki .
owner &apos;s name is mamo kahike .
she called mamo ?
you know this guy ?
yeah , i did .
mamo lived in our old neighborhood
when mary and i were just kids .
he &apos;s the one who taught us how to surf .
guy &apos;s been a beach boy since the days of duke kahanamoku .
beach boy , huh ?
you know , i &apos;ve heard of , um , mike love , brian wilson ,
but i &apos;ve never heard of mamo the beach boy .
yeah , different beach boys , danny .
they were locals who set up shop in waikiki
to teach people how to surf .
all right . why would mary go and see this guy
before she gets kidnapped ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s not for surf lessons .
there he is .
mamo !
stevie !
howzit , bruddah .
you look great .
you haven &apos;t changed in 18 years .
eh , da hair gone white and no more get nothing in the biceps .
come on . you look great . this is detective danny williams .
detective ?
how you doing ?
what bring you here ?
my sister .
did she come see you , mamo ?
yeah , she come around couple days ago .
ask me questions about your mother .
what did you tell her ?
the truth .
the truth being
that my mother didn &apos;t die in a car accident ,
that it was a car bomb that killed her ?
yes .
how did you know , mamo ?
before your mom died in that car ,
i saw a cop hanging around it ,
looking under it .
i know it was a long time ago .
you get a good look at him ?
asian . maybe six feet ?
i tell your father . he told me not to report it .
not to trust any other cop .
i would have kept my promise to your father ,
but when mary come to me ,
i felt an obligation to her ...
... and now to you .
all this time ,
why you come to me now ?
because i think the questions that mary &apos;s been asking
about our mother have just got her kidnapped .
oh , no . no .
i should &apos;ve seen this coming .
you should have seen what coming , a kidnapping ?
no . mary digging around the box .
i mean , she &apos;s my sister . i know what she &apos;s like .
the minute she found out
that dad was looking into our mother &apos;s murder ,
she would never have let that go .
and now it &apos;s my fault she &apos;s missing .
i don &apos;t know where she is .
for all i know ...
you don &apos;t know anything .
all right ? your sister mary is a very smart girl .
can we just think positive a little bit ? can we do that ?
danny , they took her . she saw their faces .
they took her because she is valuable to them .
you understand that ? she is valuable .
she knows what &apos;s inside that box .
they want to know what she knows .
all right , this is a good thing .
this keeps her alive , you understand ?
all right . we &apos;re gonna find her .
we &apos;re gonna find her . and after that ,
we &apos;re gonna find that cop that mamo saw .
i need a list of all the officers
on the force at the time of my mom &apos;s murder .
do you not think that your father
didn &apos;t already investigate these guys ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure he did , but don &apos;t you think
there &apos;s a reason he didn &apos;t make an arrest ?
absolutely . evidence . he didn &apos;t have any .
all right ? you go after a cop ,
you better make sure you know what you are doing ,
or you will have an entire department coming after you .
it &apos;s mary .
mary ? mary ? where are you ?
steve . oh , my god , steve .
i &apos;m so sorry !
calm down . calm down . listen to me .
where are you , mary ?
tell me where you are .
i &apos;m in a trunk of a car !
we need to triangulate her signal .
okay . listen to me , mary .
you got to trust me on this one . i &apos;m going to find you ,
i can promise you that ,
but you go to do what i say , all right ?
chin . we got mary up on her cell . we need a location right now .
you got to run a trace .
okay , mary . listen . can you see the taillight housing ?
they should be on either side of you .
yeah , yeah , i see them .
kick them out , mary . you got to kick them out .
kick them as hard as you can .
all right . all right .
i got it , i got it out .
look outside ,
tell me what you see .
tell me if you &apos;re passing anything familiar .
something to help me find you .
no . i don &apos;t see anything .
we &apos;re just ... it &apos;s a dirt road and we &apos;re climbing .
all right , you &apos;re climbing , ok .
what do you see , mary ?
look out . can you look left or right ?
can you see town ? can you see kailua ?
what part of the island are you on ?
yeah , yeah , i see the ...
mary ? !
chin , did you get a location ?
i couldn &apos;t get a lock , but the last signal that came
from her cell phone bounced off a transponder near punchbowl .
all right , chin , listen ,
it &apos;s coming from the trunk of a car
climbing upwards , all right ?
that &apos;s got to be the pali highway .
there are dirt roads that lead to the forest reserves
right before maunawili .
yeah .
pali highway &apos;s that way .
yeah .
yeah , what ? why are you going this way ?
because we can &apos;t get there fast enough by car .
be safe , bro .
all right , i &apos;ve got hpd and dlnr units setting up roadblocks
on either side of the pali ,
checking trunks now .
danny , danny , heading up the east ridgeline .
check out the taillight .
yep . it &apos;s out .
hold on .
hey ! hey ! hey ! gun !
mary ! mary !
come here .
oh , my god .
hey , kiddo .
thanks .
show me that .
hey , i &apos;m really sorry
that i went snooping through the box , okay ?
you can rub it in later .
i wasn &apos;t going to rub it in .
you know it &apos;s the only link that i had to dad .
i just wanted to know what it all meant , you know ,
between mom &apos;s accident and ...
finding out it wasn &apos;t an accident .
i understand , okay ?
i mean , i was just piecing it together myself .
why did you go to mamo ?
because there was a postcard
from his surf shop with a bunch
of dad &apos;s chicken scratch all over it .
i remember .
it said something like &quot; maglite , &quot;
but there was no maglite in the box .
no , but it &apos;s not a maglite .
see the &quot; g &quot; is actually a &quot; 6 . &quot;
so it &apos;s m @-@ a @-@ 6 @-@ l @-@ t.
it &apos;s cop shorthand .
how do you know cop shorthand ?
um , because i had this incident once in l.a.
what incident ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , all right ?
but the cop was writing down
all the information in the same shorthand .
so i figured that &apos;s what it was .
and since the postcard came from mamo &apos;s ,
i thought , well , maybe he &apos;s a witness .
and it turns out i was right .
so the m @-@ a @-@ 6 @-@ l @-@ t is a description
that he gave dad .
m @-@ a @-@ 6 : male , asian ,
six feet tall , light complexion .
the cop that was lurking around dad &apos;s car .
wait a minute .
where did you go after mamo told you all this ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t go anywhere .
i &apos;ve been calling the hpd for months
trying to get a police report .
and they claim it &apos;s lost .
so i asked them for a list of all the officers that were there
the day of mom &apos;s death , and they shut me down again .
i mean , i was being a complete pain in the ass ,
but ... i was doing it for mom , okay ?
who did you talk to at the hpd ?
everybody . why ?
because we busted a mole in there
a while back , and if he found out
you were there asking questions ,
he could have passed it on to all the wrong people .
i mean , i can &apos;t believe you did all this , mary .
well , i mean , dad &apos;s a cop , you &apos;re like a freakin &apos; ninja .
the least i could do was dial a phone .
you &apos;re something else .
hey .
i love you .
and i &apos;m really sorry about what happened to you today .
you know why dad shipped us away now .
it &apos;s &apos; cause mom was killed .
he was trying to protect us .
how are you going to find these guys , steve ?
i don &apos;t know .
but the only other evidence that was had
about mom &apos;s murder was in that toolbox
and now it &apos;s gone .
wait .
not exactly .
i can &apos;t believe you took photos of everything in the box .
i &apos;m sorry i went behind your back .
i think i &apos;ll get over it .
i think you have a future in the family business .
okay , wait a minute .
why the two folders ?
well , after i went through the stuff ,
i figured that anything that had to do with mom &apos;s case ,
i &apos;d put over here .
and then that stuff-- i have no clue .
like the postcards from japan .
i don &apos;t know what the stick figures mean .
i think they &apos;re from
a sherlock holmes story-- adventure of the dancing men .
sherlock holmes ?
what are you talking about ?
sir arthur conan doyle .
dad used to read me those books all the time .
okay .
he said you never had the patience .
does that mean you know what these stick figures mean , mary ?
i don &apos;t know , bro . i mean , you &apos;re the naval intelligence guy .
i think holmes cracked some code or something in the story .
hey , danny just called from the m.e. &apos; s office .
no hits on our two kidnappers &apos; prints ,
no ids , no dna matches in our system .
these guys are ghosts .
plus , they both had all their teeth .
no , but there was a third guy calling the shots ,
and that &apos;s whose tooth i knocked out .
nice work there , by the way .
thanks .
did max get anything ?
check this out .
whoa , that is some top @-@ tier craftsmanship .
that &apos;s not any style either .
that &apos;s old school irazumi . yakuza .
yeah . but judging by the work ,
no full @-@ on sleeves , these guys are low @-@ level enforcers .
mm @-@ hmm , bosozoku .
bozo @-@ zu ... what is that ?
it &apos;s a younger , flaier offshoot of the yakuza .
they &apos;re punks .
but they &apos;re armed and dangerous punks .
all right , we know where they hang out ?
every cop in oahu knows where they hang out .
everyone just treats them like they &apos;re not here .
it &apos;s like they &apos;re untouchables .
this is the place .
if our third attacker isn &apos;t in here ,
they &apos;ll know where to find him .
whoo . they got nice rides .
you know something ? i &apos;ve always wanted to ride one of these .
all right , up . up , up , up , up , up .
come on .
get up . face the wall .
let &apos;s see hands .
turn around .
that means you .
come on .
get in there .
danny .
i have a number of a therapist
i want to give you , okay ?
walk up steps like a human .
ooh . what &apos;s up with this ?
clear .
clear .
all right . turn around .
these friends of yours ?
they friends of yours ?
&apos;cause right now , they &apos;re dead , okay ?
and i want to know who they worked for .
so the first one to talk walks .
how about you ? you know these guys ?
what do you got there ?
say &quot; aah . &quot;
all right . everybody , hit the road ,
except for our friend here .
come on , let &apos;s go .
out , get out .
right this way , gentlemen .
danny ?
yes , steven ?
theoretically , if you wanted to open this guy &apos;s mouth ,
how would you do it ?
oh . uh , well , there &apos;s the , uh , the punch in the gut .
that &apos;s good . there &apos;s the knee to the ... joint .
and then i , of course have
the williams family favorite .
what &apos;s that ?
all right .
aah . nice and still .
yeah . look at that .
missing a tooth .
looks recent , too . stay there .
all right .
chin , kono , take him in .
get the tooth from the m.e.
let &apos;s see if the slipper fits , cinderella .
excuse me ? um ...
you don &apos;t want to just try asking him a question ?
he was never gonna talk .
no , of course he wasn &apos;t gonna talk .
you didn &apos;t throw him into a shark tank .
danny , these guys are yakuza middlemen .
okay ? they don &apos;t talk , ever .
they know if they do ,
their families will get wiped out .
we need to go higher up the food chain
to find out who &apos;s behind this kidnapping and my mother &apos;s murder .
okay , but without the tooth fairy ,
how are we going to do that ?
this may help .
so , it took me a while to crack the phone &apos;s encryption ,
but i pulled up several calls
from our kidnapper &apos;s phone to this man .
hiro noshimuri .
and the last one being an outgoing call
right around the time mary said she was taken .
oh , hold on . steve needs to hear this . what is he doing ?
come on . we got something .
what did you find ?
prominent venture capitalist , originally from japan .
he has residences there , dubai , malibu ,
three here in hawaii . he &apos;s really well @-@ connected .
from everything i could gather , he seems
like a very well @-@ respected , very wealthy entrepreneur .
but that does not mean he &apos;s not with the yakuza .
right ? in japan , the mob has been known to work
out in the open with major corporations .
what &apos;s his name ?
hiro noshimuri .
did i say something ?
what did you say ?
hiro noshimuri .
that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s the cipher .
hiro noshimuri .
the cipher . what does that mean ?
in 1992 , my dad was the head
of the hpd &apos;s organized crime unit .
he was investigating the expansion
of the yakuza here in hawaii .
and he was corresponding with somebody in japan ,
somebody who gave him the name hiro noshimuri , in code ,
right here .
you @-@ you got a name from a stick figure ?
the stick figures are the code .
i used frequency analysis to crack it .
&quot; frequency &quot; what ?
frequency analysis . it &apos;s a study the frequency
of letters or groups of letters
in a cypher text .
what , are you guys dating now ?
this is it . my dad was getting closer .
he wanted to uncover the identity
of the local oyabun , the boss .
that &apos;s why they targeted him .
the yakuza wanted him dead ,
so they planted a bomb under his car ,
only they didn &apos;t bet on my mother driving the car that day .
and that &apos;s why my dad wanted me to find that toolbox .
to finish this investigation that he started .
i need to know where this guy is right now .
there he is .
no , no . guys , please .
sit down . relax .
we &apos;re just gonna have a nice conversation .
go back to your , um ...
spam ...
salad .
please . have a seat .
you know , unless you &apos;re my date ,
that seat &apos;s taken .
you &apos;re really gonna sit here
and pretend you don &apos;t know who i am ?
now that you mention it ,
there &apos;s something quite familiar about your face .
let me jog your memory .
see this phone ?
this phone belonged to the man who kidnapped my sister .
kidnapper ? serious .
the last person he called was you .
wrong number .
i can assure you that i don &apos;t know anything about this .
i &apos;m just here for my lunch date .
let me tell you something .
i know who you are .
i know what you &apos;ve done to me and to my family .
and i &apos;m here to tell you
that no amount of money or manpower is going to save you .
save me ?
from what ?
from me .
what did you say your name was ?
mcgarrett ?
governor jameson .
so nice to see you again .
nice to see you .
my date .
you know this man ?
i certainly do .
we &apos;ve been friends for years .
mr. noshimuri is a most generous benefactor of hawaii .
is that right ?
yes , it is .
what is it you &apos;re doing here ?
enjoy your lunch .
i just spent the last two hours
and a hefty drink tab
trying to talk down mr. noshimuri .
what were you thinking ?
you &apos;re drinking with a criminal .
just stop right there .
that man is responsible for over 1,200 jobs
in the hawaii shipping industry alone .
not to mention the other nine companies
he has established here .
let me guess . he &apos;s a major contributor to your campaign ?
let me tell you something .
i set up this task force , i gave you immunity
and the means to pursue major felons ,
not to harass major supporters of hawaii .
if mr. noshimuri decides to pull up stakes
and move his considerable business ventures elsewhere ,
do you have any idea what would happen to the local economy ?
well , on the brighter side , the crime rate &apos;s gonna drop .
what the hell are you talking about ?
hiro is head of the yakuza here in hawaii .
that is ridiculous .
18 years ago , my father was investigating a case
against the yakuza .
he started closing in on hiro .
okay ? so they rigged his car to explode .
except my father was not driving his car that day .
my mother was .
steve , that was an accident .
it was not an accident , governor !
damn it ! listen to me !
it was not an accident !
and my father knew it was not an accident ,
but he pulled back
because of mary and me , because we were just kids .
i knew your father . if that was true ,
he would have told me .
that &apos;s just the thing .
he didn &apos;t tell anybody .
and when he died , i found this evidence that he left for me .
the evidence that led me to hiro .
and mary got her hands on it .
and she started making phone calls ,
looking into mom &apos;s death .
and yesterday , hiro had her kidnapped .
what ?
oh , my god . where is she ? is she all right ?
she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s fine for now .
oh , thank god .
i &apos;m sorry , steve .
yeah .
is there any beer in this office ?
what ?
i have never known a navy man
who couldn &apos;t find a lady a beer .
uh , yeah .
of course .
i &apos;ll , uh ... scrounge up a glass .
thank you .
steve ...
i trust your instincts ...
but ?
if what you say is true ,
and you &apos;re going to go after someone as powerful and as connected
as hiro noshimuri ,
you better be damn certain you &apos;ve got rock solid evidence ,
and proceed with extreme caution .
duly noted .
because if you don &apos;t ,
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going to be able to protect you .
well , that , uh , looked like it went really well .
should i pack now for jersey , or ...
you &apos;re not getting off that easy .
i want to know everything there is to know
about hiro noshimuri , okay ?
i want to know every business he runs ,
who all his employees are ,
all his family members , every friend he has .
i want to know where he eats .
i want to know where he sleeps . i want it all , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna tear into this guy &apos;s life ,
and we &apos;re gonna rip it all apart .
i have never liked you more than in this moment right now .
it &apos;s beautiful .
keep talking , smart @-@ ass .
you think those zip @-@ cuffs are tight now ?
they can get a lot tighter .
kono , i want this place strip @-@ searched , top to bottom .
i need something-- anything-- that connects to hiro .
yeah , you got it .
hey . i just got off the phone with hpd archives .
remember how you asked me for the names of all the cops
on the roster back in &apos; 92 ?
yeah ?
well , it turns out
there was a cop who worked in your father &apos;s district
by the name of koji noshimuri .
now , if that name sounds familiar ,
it &apos;s because he &apos;s the brother of hiro noshimuri .
all right , that @-@ that cannot be a coincidence .
he &apos;s got to be the cop that planted the bomb
on my dad &apos;s car .
mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;m going to head back to hq ,
pull everything i can on him .
listen , we get a photo ,
bring it to your boy mamo ,
maybe he can put an id him , put him at the crime scene .
maybe , but people look different after 18 years .
we &apos;re gonna need a photo from back then .
yeah . no . i think i know where to get one .
my dad was a total pack rat .
kept everything from his days as a cop .
if he &apos;s got a copy of his district picture ,
it &apos;s gonna be here .
they make every officer take one .
i blinked during mine .
i look like i &apos;m sleeping .
grace thinks it &apos;s hysterical .
koji noshimuri .
that &apos;s him . that &apos;s the guy .
let &apos;s hope your boy mamo &apos;s got a good memory .
chin . tell me you got koji .
he &apos;s alive and well , and working for his brother as-- get this--
a consultant .
he &apos;s got a place downtown , but he travels back and forth
to japan a lot for hiro .
let me ask you a question . how does a consultant
working for the yakuza earn a paycheck ?
cleaning up his brother &apos;s messes .
hey , find out if koji &apos;s in the country , okay ?
if so , i want to know where .
roger that .
what ? what are you looking at ?
what &apos;s with you ?
nothing , nothing .
i thought we had a tail . blue sedan
made the last two turns with us .
but it peeled off now .
so , what do you think ?
the guy by the car that day ?
it looks like da kine , but ...
mamo , listen . take your time , okay ?
this is important .
i think your father showed me this picture once , too .
i can &apos;t be sure .
danny . danny , danny .
black hat .
that &apos;s one of the guys that broke into my house .
gun !
gun ! gun ! down !
who paid you to break into mcgarrett &apos;s house ?
who you working for ? hiro ?
you working for hiro ?
is that who sent you , was it hiro ?
shonin , is he dead ?
no . but when i find you , you will be .
so , uh , were those bullets for you or for your boy ?
i don &apos;t know , but we got to put a security detail
on him .
i got hpd on it now .
you get anything off the shooter ?
no .
chin traced that phone ?
yeah , it &apos;s a disposable .
we got no name , we got no location .
it was hiro .
okay . you spoke to the guy once--
already recognize his voice ?
yeah , well , some things in life you don &apos;t forget .
okay , so you know , i have an amazing , amazing amount
of respect for your memory , all right ?
but without hard evidence--
hello-- without hard evidence ,
we cannot ... not go after hiro or his brother ,
and i am sure your father was in the same position
18 years ago .
hey , listen to me , i &apos;m not father , okay ?
i don &apos;t have a wife and kids to protect .
that doesn &apos;t give you license
to go out and do something stupid .
like what , put bullets in koji and hiro &apos;s heads ?
yeah , that would qualify .
all right , you heard the boss--
we &apos;ll take whatever we can get .
drugs , guns , cash , paperwork .
bag it and tag it and get it back to hq .
hey , you two , come on , come with me .
let &apos;s go .
five @-@ o !
we &apos;re seizing all this as evidence !
we need to get all this out of here .
go through these bags .
this garbage is from the club .
you know , i never would &apos;ve left the island ,
i never would &apos;ve joined the navy
or missed every holiday , every birthday ,
half of mary &apos;s life .
the day that car exploded , it made me who i am .
danny , i can &apos;t just let it go .
i &apos;m not asking you to let it go .
i want to get these guys as bad as you do .
and we will , we will , &apos; cause hiro is getting sloppy .
waikiki , broad daylight , a shootout on the beach ?
come on .
yeah , i know , he &apos;s desperate .
he &apos;s desperate and stupid .
all right ? we will catch these guys slipping , i promise you .
we just got to wait and keep eye on &apos; em .
they will make a mistake .
yeah , when they do we &apos;re gonna be there for it .
kono , tell me you got something .
you won &apos;t believe this-- i found your dad &apos;s toolbox
in the dumpster out back .
the only thing is , it &apos;s empty .
all the evidence that was inside is gone .
okay , listen to me , print it inside and out .
this may be the piece evidence that connects hiro
to the break @-@ in and to mary &apos;s abduction .
yeah , you got it .
guess there must be a hole in the security , koji .
security &apos;s good ,
it &apos;s the members we got to worry about .
you koji ?
mcgarrett , the governor know you &apos;re here ?
yeah , she knows .
she knows everything .
tell me something .
my father was the intended target , right ?
you didn &apos;t mean to kill my mother , right ?
you screwed up , tell me that .
nice fantasy .
but you don &apos;t have any proof .
no evidence at all .
no , i got no proof .
no proof of my mother &apos;s murder .
but mary &apos;s kidnapping ...
that &apos;s where we got you .
you like that glove ?
hmm ? that glove , it fit good ?
i mean , i think it looks nice .
i think you should just use it more often ,
like when you &apos;re handling stolen property .
you know what i mean ?
you touched it . you opened the box ,
you got rid of the evidence ,
but you just had to see what my father had on you , didn &apos;t you ?
what are you looking at him for ?
don &apos;t look at him-- it &apos;s not his fault .
it &apos;s not your fault , koji .
huh ? i mean , he did a terrible job of ditching the evidence ,
but you , you are the idiot
that left your prints all over the lid .
you &apos;re under arrest .
play through for me , mcgarrett .
i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
a lot can happen in a couple of hours , you know what i mean ?
it &apos;s jail , it ain &apos;t the ritz .
come on .
i know you rigged that car , i don &apos;t have any proof ,
but i will .
i &apos;m gonna do whatever it takes .
i &apos;m gonna be on you 24 / 7 .
i &apos;m gonna dig up every skeleton in every closet ,
and then i &apos;m coming after you .
you , what &apos;s your name ?
wo fat .
the game &apos;s over , go home .
yes , sir .
now boarding , flight 7013 to los angeles ,
gate number six .
this is so stupid .
i didn &apos;t even want to be here .
now i don &apos;t want to go .
it was kind of starting to feel like home again .
what are you talking about ?
this is always gonna be your home .
but while koji &apos;s a free man , and until this is over
and i know it &apos;s safe for you to be here ...
i &apos;m having a deja vu moment .
it &apos;s just like before ,
when dad brought both of us here ,
put us on different planes back to the mainland .
i haven &apos;t talked to you in ten years .
and i never saw dad again .
we &apos;re gonna see each other again , okay ?
we will .
you promise ?
yes , i promise .
come here .
final boarding call for flight 7013 to los angeles .
all passengers must be on board at this time .
call me when you land in l.a. , all right ?
i will .
bye .
have a good flight .
thank you .
bye .
where you been ? i called you on your cell .
i had to drop mary off , and then i lost track of time .
i &apos;m sorry about that , man .
you got to give her credit .
i mean , she was on to something .
all this stuff in my father &apos;s toolbox--
it &apos;s not just about my mom &apos;s case .
there &apos;s a bunch of other stuff that &apos;s much more current ,
like the investigation he was involved in
before hesse killed him .
we &apos;ve got a bunch of leads to follow up on here .
yeah , well , there &apos;s something we don &apos;t have
to follow up on now .
what ?
hiro &apos;s brother koji was found dead an hour ago .
how ?
car accident .
you believe that ?
