第一季 第一集
Hey,upper east siders,
Gossip girl here,
And I have the biggest news ever.
One of my ma sources...
Melanie91... sends us this...
Spotted at grand central,
Bags in hand...
Serena van der woodsen.
Was it only a year ago our "it" girl
Mysteriously disappeared
For "boarding school"?
And just as suddenly,she's back.
Don't believe me?
See for yourselves.
Lucky for us,lanie91
Sent proof.
Thanks for the photo,mel.
Dan,jenny,over here!
Hey,dad!
Hey,hey,you made it!
Welcome back.
How was your weekend?
How's your mom?
Fine. she's good.
Uh,fine and good.
She's... she's good and... and fine.
Like,"maybe I never should've left manhattan" fine,
Or "taking a time-out from my marriage
Was the best idea I ever had" fine?
Dad,you know what?
I- I am,uh,i'm starving.
Let's go home. I'm cooking.
Caprese salad,a little mozzarella di bufala.
Yeah,i'm gonna make you guys...
Spotted... lonely boy.
Can't believe the love of his life has returned...
If only she knew who he was.
But everyone knows serena,and everyone is talking.
Wonder what blair waldorf thinks.
Sure,they're b.f.s,
But we always thought
Blair's boyfriend nate
Had a thing for serena.
Design a dress for this woman.blair,
If you're gonna wear one of my designs,
Tell me so we can at least get it properly fitted.
Thanks,mom.
Keep that in mind.
Great party.
She is mybest advertisement.
So,nate,you started thinking about college?
Well,actually,i'm a dartmouth man.
Yes,dad's always spoken very highly of dartmouth,
But I'd like to check out west.
You know,maybe u.s.c.,u.c.l.a....
His mother wouldn't hear of it.
Dartmouth is far enough away for her.
Yes,well,dartmouth is my first choice.
Excuse me,captain.
Nate,can I borrow you?
Uh,sure. will you excuse me for a second?
Nathaniel...
Any interest in some fresh air?
When I get back?
If he gets back.
What's going on?
I wanna do this...
It... now.
Now now? yeah.
I thought you wanted to wait.
Not anymore.
Better lock it down with nate,
B. clock's ticking.
Oh,my god! you'll never believe what's on "gossip girl."
Someone saw serena getting off the train at grand central.
Good. things were getting a little dull around here.
Thank you.
I love you...
Nate archibald.
Always have,always will.
I love you,too.
Serena van der woodsen?
Is that you?!
Blair,it's serena!
Serena?
Serena's at school.kiss me.
No,i just heard your mom say she's here.
Don't you wanna go say hey?
Yeah...
Totally.
...but I heard she was pregnant.
No,but it's rehab.
Sign me up for that. she looks go.
So I told him,"forget it.
I don't care if it's murakami.
It clashes with my sofa."
Mom,mom
Hey,good to see you.
Serena,darling. oh!
Um,so where is he?
What,they haven't let him out yet?
Oh,let's not discuss that right now,okay?
I thought you might wanna see some of your friends.
Thanks.
Serena!
It's so good to see you! how are you? good to see you!
Come,we're about to have dinner.
I'll set a place for you at the table next to blair.
Yeah,actually,um,there's somewhere I have to go.
You're leaving?
Yeah,i-i just...i don't feel well.
I just wanted to come by and say hi.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.
School? so I guess she's back for good.
Didn't you know she was coming?
Of course I did.
I just... wanted it to be a surprise.
Word is that s. bailed on b.'s party in under 90 seconds
And didn't even have one limoncello.
Has our bad girl reallygone good?
Or is it all just part of the act?
Young lady,you can't be here.
Visiting hours are over.
I'm family.
He's my brother.
Why'd she leave?
Why'd she return?
Send me all the deets.
And who am i?
That's one secret I'll never tell...
The only one.
X.o.x.o.,gossip girl.
And who am i
That's one secret I'll never tell...
You know you love me
Serena?
Serena?
Hey,how are you?
You know...
I've been better.
Eric,i know I've been a terrible sister...
Oh,i'm just so happy to see you.
Must be a lot of rumors
Why you're back.
Yeah,but none of them mention you.
Just like mom wants,huh?
What do I want,baby?
For serena to sleep in her own bed,
Possibly wearing pajamas.
Morning,mom.
Hey,i was just about to ask the doctor
If I could take eric to breakfast.
Wanna come?
Um... no.
I think what I'll do is go get him a croissant down the street.
Serena,don't.
Let me guess...
You told everyone
Eric's just visiting grandpa in rhode island.
Your aunt carol in miami.
So you're actually hiding him?
He tries to take his own life,
And you're worried
It's gonna cost you "mom the year"?
Serena,
You've been gone,doing who knows what with god knows who...
I told you,boarding school was not like that.
Then you know what? as happy as I am to have you home,
You have no idea what it's been like.
Guess whose dad is cool?
It's a trick question.
Yeah,'cause it can't be ours.
Ha ha,ha ha. look at this.
"top ten forgotten bands of the '90s. "
Yeah,check out who's number nine.
He's very proud. mm-hmm.
Hey! hey,way to be forgotten.
But that's how you get remembered.
Maybe you'd care if dad's band was on "gossip girl."
What?
I don't read "gossip girl."
That's... that's for chicks.
So that wasn't your laptop open to it last night
Reading all about serena van der woodsen?
"rolling stone"? wow.
Let me take a look at this again,dad.Tr鑣cool.
Lincoln hawk...number nine.
Hey,what are you working on?
It's called the kiss on the lips party.
Everyone's going.
You were invited to that?
Well,no offense if I sound surprised
Since l have never been invited.
One of the girls in my art class
Saw my calligraphy,
And she said that if I addressed all the invitations
That I could have one.
Sounds very fair. the sweatshops could learn a thing or two.
Dad,this is not a platform for one of your anticapitalist rants.
Yes,it is.
Besides,you make us go to private school.
That's for your education.
So we should just be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone
And never get invited to parties?
Works for me.
Mom thinks it's a good idea.
And her judgment is always sound,right?
Jenny,you wanna go to that party,you should go.
You kids could use some fun.
Nate?
Uh,your mom told me you guys were staying here at the palace.
Yeah,uh,we're renovating again.
You know my mom...
If it's not broke,break it.
So what are you doing here?
Oh,i just wanted to see how you were.
You seemed kind of upset last night.
I- I gotta get going and change for school.
I'm gonna be late.
Serena... no. no.
But you're back now...
I didn't come back for you.
Look,blair's my best friend,
And you're her boyfriend,
And she loves you.
That's the way things are supposed to be.
Hey,watch where you're going!
Serena looked effing hot last night.
There's something wrong with that level of perfection.
It needs to be violated.
You are deeply disturbed.
And yet,you know I'm right.
You're telling me if you had the chance...
I have a girlfriend.
You guys have been dating since kindergarten
And you haven't sealed the deal.
Who says,"seal the deal"?
Come on.
Are you following us or something?
No,i-i go to your school.
Identical uniforms?
Is that kind of a tip-off?
That's funny.
So you guys wanna sit together at lunch?
So cute!
These should be framed or something.
Not bad work.
And here's yours,as promised.
Thanks.
Here you guys are.
I looked all over the dining hall for you.
Oh,hi,i'm serena.
I know.i mean,
Hi,i'm jenny.
So...
When's the party?
Saturday.
And...
You're kinda not invited...
Since until 12 hours ago,
Everyone thought you were at boarding school.
Now we're full,
And,uh,jenny used up all the invites.
Um,actually...
You can go now.
Sorry.
No,that's okay.
I got a lot of stuff to do anyway.
Well,we should get going then.
Unless you want us to wait for you.
Looks like you got a lot of yogurt left.
No,go ahead.
Blair,think we could meet tonight?
I'd love to,
But I'm doing something with nate tonight.
The palace. 8:00?
Nate will wait.
Spotted on the steps of the met...
An s. and b. power struggle.
I could probably do a half-hour.
Did s. think she could waltz home,
And things would be just like they were?
Thanks for making the time.
You're my best friend.
Did b. think s.would go down without a fight?
Or can these two hotties work it t?
There's nothing gossip girl likes more than a good catfight,
And this cou be a classic.
Uh,you know... you know,dad,
There's this thing called my space where
You can post all this information online.
Save some trees. have a blog.
Maybe if musicians got off their blogs
And picked up their guitars,
The music business would be in better shape.
Spoken like a true relic.
Thanks,son.
Help,emergency ,712.5th ave
Hey,dad,listen,um,i gotta run.
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah. yeah,your mom will be back.
She's always been a free spirit.
That's one of the reasons I fell for her in the first place.
I meant with the fliers.
Luckily,staple guns are old school.
Go. I'm gonna be fine.
I talked to the nurse,and I'm kidnapping you.
We're going shopping,aren't we?
We're going to bendel's,
Just for an hour,though,i swear.
I had a really bad day.
Really? 'cause I had a great day...
A couple of pills,bunch of rorschach tests.
They had this green jell-o for lunch.
Mmm! why didn't you save me any?
Come on,let's go.
We gotta get you out of here before mom shows up.
Jenny,what is it?
What's wrong?
Do you like this on me?
Wait... wait a second.
Is that why you need me?
I thought this was an emergency.
A fashion emergency.
I mean come on,i've never been to a big dance before.
Neither have i.
Yeah,but mom's gone,
And dad's allergic to department stores.
Well,you look good,jen.
You do,really.
Thanks.
I mean,too bad it's more than our rent,
But I think I can sew something like it.
Oh,my gosh,it's serena.
Hi,serena!
Hey. jenny,right?
Yeah,hi, this is my...
Stylist and personal shopper eric. hi.
Hi. hi.
Um,this is my brother.
Um,so is... is that your dress for the kiss on the lips party?
Sort of.
Speaking of that,um,here.
I made you one during free period,
But if anyone asks where you got it,i know nothing.
Thanks.
Dan? dan?
Jenny?
That dress would look even better in black.
Black. cool. thanks.
This is some good stuff.
Yeah,i'm gonna need it.
Blair's mom's at the country house.
Yeah? well,then maybe I should swipe some of my dad's viagra...
Or my mom's paxil?
Nathaniel,you're finally about to have sex with your girlfriend.
It's like you're headed to your execution.
No,man,i'm good.
Talk to chuck,buddy.
You and blair have been dating forever.
All of a sudden there's a problem?
There's no problem.
It's just...
Do you ever feel like our whole lives
Have been planned out for us,
That we're just gonna end up like our parents?
Man,that's a dark thought.
And aren't we entitled to choose,
Just to be happy?
Look,easy,socrates.
What we're entitled to is a trust fund,
Maybe a house in the hamptons,
A prescription drug problem.
But happiness does not seem to be on the menu,
So smoke up
And seal the deal with blair,
Cause you're also entitled to tap that ass.
So how's your mom doing
With the divorce and everything?
Great.
So my dad left her for another man.
She lost 15 pounds,got an eye lift.
It's been good for her.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah,i could tell,
Since you didn't call or write the entire time it was happening.
No,i-i know,i was just...
Boarding school is like...
I don't even know why you went to boarding school to being with.
Do you know how it felt calling your house when
You didn't show up at school and having your mom say,
"serena didn't tell you that she moved to connecticut?"
I just...
I- I had to go. I just...
I need to get away from everything.
Please,just trust me.
How can I trust you
When I feel like I don't even know you?
Let's fix that.
I saw you at school with... with katy and is,
And i-i get it.
I- I don't want to take any of that away from you...
Because it's just yours to take if you want it.
No,that... that's not what I mean. i...
I miss you.
I just want things to go back to the way they used to be...
You know,walking to school together,
Dancing on tables at bungalow,
Night swimming at your mom's country house.
You were like my sister.
You know,and with our families...
We need each other.
You missed some classic eleanor waldorf meltdowns.
If it wasn't such a tragedy,it would've been funny.
Actually,it kind of was.
Hmm,well,i wish I could've been there.
You are now.
I have to meet nate.
Kinda have something special planned.
Well,i don't want to keep you,but,um...
I love you,b.
I love you,too,s.
Spotted at the palace hotel...
S. and b.
Having a heart-to-heart.
Hmm,why so thirsty,s.?
You may have won over b. for now,
But we still think you're hiding something.
Ah,the invisible man returns.
You know,i really had no idea you could move that fast.
Yeah,well,uh,your fashion emergency was solved,
So I figured my work was done.
Come on,dan.
Serena said hi to you at a ninth grade birthday party,
And you've never forgotten it.
How could i?
She was the only person who spoke to me.
And I'm pretty sure she thought I was someone else.
You know,she's actually nice.
And if she did know you,
I think she'd really like you.
I don't know. I think she might be a tad overwhelmed
By the glitz and the glamour of the humphrey lifestyle.
Well,i heard she's living at the palace hotel...
Well,my... my point exactly.
Probably sitting at the bar by herself,
Sipping martinis,all alone.
You know,it's actually kind of sad.
Oh,and,um,dad's at the gallery working late.
He,uh,left money for dinner,
So I was thinking indian.
You know... you know what?
I think I'm...
I'm gonna go out.
Okay.
Good,'cause I already ordered and only got enough for one.
Move,please.
I love this town.
I'm going to have to tell my parents
The hotel they just bought is serving minors.
And if you get a drink,
They're also serving pigs.
I love it when you talk dirty.
You just love when a girl talks to you.
Actually,i prefer them when they're not talking.
Mm,i've missed your witty banter.
Let's catch up,
Take our clothes off,stare at each other.
How about I just get a bite to eat?
I've been drinking on an empty stomach.
I heard you didn't do that anymore.
Special occasion.
Well,how about a grilled cheese with truffleil?
You do love truffles.
Enough to know it's not on the menu.
Good thing I'm connected.
Only 'cause I'm hungry.
Is it too much?
I want it to be special.
What's wrong?
Look,i don't know how to say this...
Or if it's even the right thing to do,
But,um...
There's something I need to tell you.
Alfonso,you're a stud.
Now,uh,have a good night.
We're closing the kitchen early.
Oh,my god.
This is so good.
Well,if you're looking for a way to thank me,
I've got a couple ideas.
It's a sandwich,chuck.
This is...
This is not happening right now.
You worried nate'll find out?
What?
Last year...
The shepherd wedding.
You think I don't know why you left town?
Come on,hurry up.
You know we're not supposed to be in here.
Oh,if the happy couple didn't want to put up the cash for the premium bar,
They should have made their wedding b.y.o.b.
No! let me see it.
No,make me.
I can do it. I can do it.
No,you can't. let me just show you.
Here,come here. let me see it.
I can do it. stop.
That never happens to me.
It's okay.you're still a man in my eyes.
Come here.
Look at you. you're a mess.
So are you.
But... that was it.
You guys kissed.
Best friend and the boyfriend.
That's pretty classy,s.
I think you're more like me than you'd admit.
No.
No,that... that was then.
I... I'm trying to change.
I liked you better before.
Chuck,stop it. stop.
No! chuck,stop it!
I knew it!
I always knew there was something! get out!
Chuck! no!
Get off of me!
I'm so sorry.
Are... are you okay?
And just when b. and s. had built a bridge,
It all had to come crashing down.
But dry your eyes.
The kiss on the lips party is around the corner.
And you know who loves parties?
Gossip girl.
Nice try,son.
Maybe next time.
You seem upbeat this morning.
Did you have fun with blair last night?
Actually,we got into a pretty big fight.
Oh,you want my advice? apologize
Even if it was her fault.
Flowers,maybe some jewelry if she's really upset.
Always works for your mom.
I don't know. I think it might be for the best.
Wait a minute.you guys broke up?
Yeah,i guess we did.
Blair is a great girl.
I know. I'm just not sure if she's the girl for me.
And you guys have been dating since kindergarten.
So I keep hearing.
Well,you love her,don't you?
Yes,i do.
I just think it might be good for us to take a break,you know?
Maybe not right now.
Eleanor waldorf is gearing up to take her company public,
And I've been courting her for months
To let me handle the deal.
Then you should get it.
I will get it. if you could just help me out a little bit...
What?
You love her. she loves you.
It's just a rough patch,that's all.
You don't give up just because things are hard,
Not in business,
Or if your family is depending on you.
How do you know it was miss van der woodsen's if you didn't read it?
And if you're not a guest at the hotel,
What were you doing here?
What?
Uh,look,when prince charming found cinderella's slipper,
They didn't accuse him of having a foot fetish.
Uh,and you're prince charming?
Well,there's miss van der woodsen now. no,no!
Uh,serena?
No,no,no,no,no.what are you doing? don't.
Hey,um,do you know this young man?
She doesn't know me.
Nobody knows me.
It's cool. it's fine.
Uh... from last night.
Are you...
Um,i'm sorry about that.
You remember me?
She remembers me.
Well,he claims he found your cell phone.
Oh! you found it.
Hey,mom.
Guess what I got for you...
A dress for kiss on the lips.
I saw the invitation on the nightstand.
Oh,uh,i'm not going to that.
What do you mean?
Blair's throwing it.
Yeah,um,see the problem is,um,
By... by the time I got the invitation,
I,um,actually already had plans.
Plans with whom?
My friend.
Uh... yeah,hi.
Uh,nice to meet you,mrs. van der woodsen.
I'm dan humphrey.
What are you and dan humphrey doing?
We...
Uh,uh,we're... we're going to a concert tonight.
Lincoln hawk?
Yeah,"rolling stone" named them
One of the top ten forgotten bands the '90s.
Whoo! I'm a huge fan.
Well,this party would've been
The perfect opportunity for you to announce your return,
But I guess I'll just,uh,keep the dress for myself.
Thank you.
Yeah,no,uh...
It's not a problem,really.
So you'll pick me up at 8:00?
You'd really go out with some guy you don't know?
Well,you can't be worse than the guys idoknow.
Thanks for meeting me.
Look,blair,i- I really hurt you,
And I know that,and I wanna fix it.
Really? and how are you gonna do that?
I'm gonna put everything in the past.
I'm not gonna see serena again
Or even talk to her.
It'll be like she doesn't exist.
I think that's a good idea.
Let's not mention it again.
You gonna eat that?
That's it?
Cause you were pretty upset last night.
I mean,should we talk about this?
There's nothing to talk about.
I overreacted.
If you say it's in the past,
It's in the past.
I'm sure you have no feelings for her anymore.
I just feel bad for serena.
She'll really miss you.
What time does the limo come?
8:00.
Perfect.
Lily.
Are you shopping for some art to match your furniture?
Why is my daughter going to one of your concerts?
Cause we're awesome.
With your son.
Dan scored a date with serena?
Well,our kids were bound to meet.it's a small island.
Are you sure it's not some ploy,
Your using my daughter to get to me now that your wife left you?
How do you know about alison?
Like you said...small island.
Oh,i get it.
You hear about alison,
Use your daughter as an excuse to start something.
Yeah.
In your dreams.
Well,youarein my dreams,lily,and one in particular recurs...
It involves finding you in the back of a nine inch nails bus
With your shoes in your earrings and trent reznor...
That happened.
No need to rehash details of decades past.
So I moved on...
Yeah,from trent to layne to perry,
Till you switched up rock stars
For billionaires.
You think you're so cute...
Washed-up band,crappy so-called art gallery.
Well,not all of us
Have settlements from multiple divorces to sustain us.
Just stay out of my life,rufus.
You're going out with serena,
And I'm going to kiss on the lips.
Who said this family wasn't cool?
Well,listen,i don't want to be late,but good luck,all right?
Same.
See you at the concert,right,dad?
Uh... okay.
Oh,my god.
My daughter's a woman.
Dad,you could just tell me I look nice
Instead of turning this into a sermon on the passage of time.
You look like...
Your mother.
Thanks.
Blair,let me see how it looks.
Why are you wearing that one?
Didn't you see the dress I left on the bed?
I like this one.
This one is not as elegant a choice as that one.
Why do you care so much?
Because I love you.
Blair
You will never be more beautiful or thin or happy than you are right now.
I just want you to make the most of it.
I guess I have time to change.
And put some product in your hair. the ends are dry.
Who's the newbie?
Jenny humphrey.
She's a freshman.
I love freshmen.
They're so...
Fresh?
Anything about her on "gossip girl"?
No.
Hmm,until you're done with her.
Hi. I'm chuck.
I know. um,i mean...
Hi,i'm... I'm jenny.
It's,uh,it's nice to meet you.
You,too.
Thank you.
Looks like little j. might end up with a new boy
And a ticket to the inner circle.
Or will c.end up with another victim?
I told you I love parties.
So I'm little overdressed,aren't i?
Honestly
I don't really have a problem with your appearance.
Hey,come on. I want you to meet one of the guys in the band.
Oh,so you're a groupie?
Well,not quite.
Serena,i'd like you to meet rufus humphrey.
Dad,this is serena.
Serena van der woodsen.
Oh,uh,i don't know how I know that.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you,too.
You guys are a little early.
It's gonna be a while before we take the stage.
Yeah,i-i may have slightly overbudgeted for travel time.
I should go tune that.
Excuse me. enjoy the show.
Son,talk to you later.
Dad,see you.
You took me to meet your dad on a first date?
So this... this is a date?
Maybe I should've worn my loafers then...
Dressed down a little bit.
Let's go and talk somewhere quieter.
Okay.
Well,this is definitely quieter,
But,um,do you actually know where we're going or...
Here looks pretty good.
So... uh,you said you wanted to talk.
Um,what'd you want to talk about?
How into you I am.
Okay,i'm... I'm sorry. uh...
If you don't want to do anything,that's... that's cool.
Let... let's start over.
Um,do you want to start over back at the party?
Uh,have a glass of champagne.
Please?
Maybe one.
Thanks.
What? sorry. no,nothing,nothing.
I just,um...
My sister was right.
You're nice.
But you asked me out on a date,and you didn't think I was nice?
No,uh,i just thought you were hot.
And technically,you asked me out.
Oh,okay. okay,i see.
So,um,sensitive,tortured soul boy
Is actually kinda superficial,huh?
Yeah,just... just a little bit.
Good to know.
Help emergrncy need you
For real please u know chuck?
What,better offer?
No,it's my sister.
She's at that kiss on the lips party,you know?
She's having some problems with this guy chuck.
I'm sorry. I have to go.
I'll go with you.
No,really,that's okay.
No,no,listen.
If it's chuck,it's not okay.
Look,i'm... I'm gonna do a lap,okay? look for her.
Okay,yeah.
Serena? it's serena!
Oh,my god! what?!
She's really here?
Is that really her? everyone said she wasn't invited.
I think she's wasted.
Do you think blair knows?
What's she wearing? what's with that dress?
She's so brave.
You know serena...
She'd never miss a party.
Serena's here?!
What is she doing here?
She wasn't invited.
Blair,come on,are you really gonna kick her out?
Did you invite her?
What? no!
God,i told you...
Do not talk to her.
I was going for a walk.
