why would i give this to hanna ?
if this came out , i could lose my job .
i just can &apos;t ever picture alison wearing this .
well , picture vivian darkbloom .
vivian told you about alison ?
she said she had a friend named alison
who was getting texts from somebody .
if this jonah had real information ,
ali might &apos;ve known who &quot; a &quot; was .
there was something else in that box .
$ 15,000 in cash .
where would ali have gotten that kind of money ?
ezra is leaving .
he &apos;s taking that job in new orleans .
what job ?
the job that dad set him up with .
what does the dilaurentis family have on us ?
it &apos;s complicated .
my dad , is he your father too ?
melissa doesn &apos;t know either .
don &apos;t protect her . she lied to us .
caleb sent me an e @-@ mail .
she &apos;s coming upstairs .
are we about to see alison get killed ?
where is she ?
emily fields ?
yes ?
we need to talk to you .
about what ?
maya st. germain .
so , what &apos;d they say ?
not a lot .
the police said that maya &apos;s parents found a note .
it looked like she packed a bag .
do they know where she went ?
they were asking the questions , not me .
that &apos;s not fair . you &apos;re her girlfriend .
maybe . she hasn &apos;t returned any of my texts .
anyways , hanna , i &apos;m really tired .
did you tell them that ?
that i &apos;m tired ?
no .
about the texts .
emily , every detail counts .
i told them that we got into a fight
and that maya threatened
to run away before she &apos;d ever go back to boot @-@ camp .
that &apos;s what she did .
she &apos;ll call , em . okay ?
it wasn &apos;t like i went running to the cops .
you lied to me and then you got in a car with garrett reynolds ,
i saw you .
i didn &apos;t want you to worry .
i thought if you knew that i was talking to the police--
why him ?
garrett was ian &apos;s friend .
and he &apos;s been really kind to me since the funeral .
he checks in on me ,
he takes me to the doctor when he can
and ... i needed someone to talk to .
about what ?
about ian .
i still don &apos;t believe that i married the guy
who was capable of killing alison .
the night of the funeral i wanted to talk to you about this .
i &apos;ve been holding on to this--
this feeling that something was wrong ever since then .
so you went to garrett about it last night .
i did , but--
i think it was a mistake .
i &apos;ve shared a lot with him .
maybe too much .
like what ?
do you remember that summer ?
it seemed like mom and dad were constantly fighting .
the day alison went missing , it stopped .
and i don &apos;t think it was a coincidence .
dad , he had a really strange reaction when he heard the news .
it was--
it was almost like he was relieved .
i &apos;m listening . go on .
one night before she disappeared ,
i came home late .
dad was up , something was bothering him ,
but i didn &apos;t notice at first .
i was a wreck myself .
i had caught alison flirting with ian again .
i-- i sent texts to--
ali ?
telling her to back the hell off .
i told dad everything . i didn &apos;t know what else to do .
did you sign these texts ?
i didn &apos;t have to . she knew who they were from .
yeah , so what &apos;d dad say ?
nothing .
he just had this look like he supported me .
and you told this to garrett .
ugh . i never should &apos;ve opened up to him .
i was just venting , trying to sort through my feelings .
this is not good .
why ?
melissa , we &apos;re not the only people who know about jason .
dad might &apos;ve been blackmailed .
what ? by who ?
alison .
jason found cash , a lot of it .
ali was hiding it , and i asked dad about it .
the blackmail ?
and he told me that he never paid alison a cent .
do we believe that ?
so , your father is coming home from his conference today .
and ?
and i know he &apos;s very excited about the father / daughter dance .
yeah , well , the father / daughter dance
is a little more irony than i can handle right now .
well , maybe you should learn to embrace the irony
because there seems to be a lot of it in our lives .
mom , if you could just talk to dad
and try and convince him .
honey , at this point ,
i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;d be trying to convince him of .
wait .
what happened to last night &apos;s
&quot; i &apos;m trying to understand you and ezra . &quot;
i still am . it &apos;s a process .
for now , i don &apos;t think your father really needs to know about it .
hello ?
hey , ashley .
i told you not to call me at home .
i take it that means that you haven &apos;t talked to your daughter
about where she got that report .
i gave it to you so you could come up with some answers .
i &apos;m trying to keep hanna out of it .
out of it ? she &apos;s right in the middle of it .
well , so are you .
my daughter is being targeted ,
and you need to find out who &apos;s doing this to her .
unless you &apos;d like me to talk to someone else in the department .
don &apos;t call me at the house again .
ashley , i--
ashley .
good morning .
not really .
i just got off the phone with dad .
he bailed on tomorrow night &apos;s dance .
said he had a prior commitment .
work or business .
but , whatever .
i mean , i was over that dance last year .
you know , i could take you to the dance .
hello ? father / daughter .
what , you think you &apos;re the only girl
with divorced parents whose dad can &apos;t make it ?
no , but i &apos;d be the only one lame enough
to show up and advertise it .
i can take the heat .
i think missing out on something you &apos;re looking forward to
is lamer than going with your mother .
okay . let &apos;s do it .
me and you .
&quot; do mom and dad know you &apos;re watching murder movies ?
that would kill them to find out . &apos; a &apos; &quot;
is &quot; a &quot; talking about the n .a .t. video ?
of course . &quot; a &quot; knows we have their cell phone .
you guys get that text from &quot; a &quot; ?
yes , and now melissa &apos;s threatening to kill our parents .
i already told you , melissa can &apos;t be &quot; a. &quot;
alison was getting texts
from the law firm your sister interned at .
yes , but she explained that .
melissa just wanted ali to leave ian alone .
so what ? what , i got chased by a hobo for nothing ?
that still doesn &apos;t explain why melissa got into garrett &apos;s car .
do you think garrett told her about the video ?
cause if she knows that she &apos;s on it and if she &apos;s &quot; a &quot; --
you guys , my sister is not &quot; a. &quot;
i watched her fall apart when we found ian &apos;s body .
she had no idea that he was dead .
she wouldn &apos;t just text herself from her dead husband &apos;s phone
and lose it like that . could we--
could we please just breathe for a second ?
no . we have video of four people who could &apos;ve killed alison .
okay ? they were in her bedroom the night she died .
can &apos;t we get in trouble for withdrawing evidence ?
i think you mean withholding .
look , spencer &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve jumped the gun before .
we &apos;ve gone to the cops .
and we ended up looking guilty .
yeah , and they already think that we stole something from the morgue .
i don &apos; think that we should give this to them .
look , i know that i &apos;m asking a lot ,
but , i think that i might have a way to find out more .
so , can you guys just give me a chance to get into this ?
okay .
i have got to find an obstetrician in the city .
all this back and forth for these appointments is just--
from dad ?
&quot; looking forward to the dance . &quot;
wow . dad went a little bit overboard .
it &apos;s called overcompensating .
he still believes he can use his money to shut people up .
melissa , i &apos;m not going there , okay ?
dad did not pay off ali .
we were both lied to , spence .
this necklace is nothing but his guilt talking .
yeah , but being jason &apos;s father is not the same thing
as what you &apos;re thinking about .
i &apos;m thinking that he has a lot to cover up for .
oh , you opened it .
i wanted to see the look on your face .
it &apos;s-- it &apos;s just so--
speechless .
you see that ? exactly what i was going for .
come here .
now , you have to promise me
you &apos;re gonna wear it to the dance tomorrow night , okay ?
sure . promise .
thanks for meeting me here .
i don &apos;t want these conversations to be overheard any more than you do .
do you have something ?
a request .
i already told you . i &apos;ve tried talking to hanna .
she &apos;s not giving anything up .
but her phone will .
you want her phone .
i need to know who she &apos;s been talking to .
whom she &apos;s been texting .
whoever gave her that report is in hanna &apos;s world .
she &apos;s probably talked to them ,
and she &apos;s definitely talked to her friends about them .
i don &apos;t think i could do that .
well , think about it again , ashley .
cause if we want answers ,
then you need to get me that phone .
so , where &apos;s caleb ?
he &apos;s in montecito for the weekend ,
visiting his parents .
tough life , huh ?
yeah .
have you heard from &quot; a &quot; again ?
no . good thing too .
they say the punishment &apos;s supposed to fit the crime ,
but this community service gig ,
is like the ninth circle of hell .
okay , it can &apos;t be that bad .
today i went from the soup kitchen to the senior center .
i &apos;ve gone from shopping carts to walkers .
what &apos;s next ? driving the short bus ?
mona , you are terrible .
hey , isn &apos;t that your mom ?
hanna ?
why ? why would you talk to wilden ?
hanna--
you &apos;re not , like , into him , are you ?
no . god , no .
well then , what ?
why would you be in a car with him ?
i &apos;m looking for answers
because i can &apos;t get any from you .
what kind of answers ?
the other day , when mona was here ,
i saw that shredded police report you had .
yeah . so ?
so where did it come from ?
i don &apos;t know .
clearly , someone is trying to use that to hurt you ,
and me , so i gave it to wilden .
look , i don &apos;t like him any more than you do .
but if he can keep you safe--
no , giving that report to wilden is the opposite of safe .
mom , if that gets out--
it &apos;s already out .
it was on our kitchen counter .
wilden has just as much at stake as we do .
he could lose his job , and , hanna ,
you don &apos;t always know what &apos;s best .
yeah ? well if you went to wilden ,
then neither do you .
hanna .
didn &apos;t dad tell you to start by shaving with the grain ?
i &apos;m still trying to find the grain .
i just thought i &apos;d try while he was away , making a boy--
and taking pictures .
yeah , no event too small to commemorate .
are you still going to the dance ?
why ?
uh , well , gavin asked me to lend a hand deejaying , so ,
i could use a ride .
yeah , well , better find some backup .
i &apos;m not really feeling the whole father / daughter thing lately .
well , i think you should go .
yeah ? why ?
dad still thinks you &apos;re seeing holden , right ?
what makes you think that i &apos;m not ?
did mom te--
she didn &apos;t have to .
i heard you guys when you came home last night .
if you don &apos;t go , he &apos;s just gonna get suspicious
that you &apos;re-- you &apos;re ducking out
to see your secret boyfriend all over again .
can i ask you a question ?
sure .
you and fitz being together ,
it &apos;s caused a lot of problems , right ?
not just with you , but kind of with everybody .
i guess .
i &apos;m not blaming you , i just-- i don &apos;t get it .
you and dad right now ,
it &apos;s just the latest in a whole bunch of messy fights
and lies and bad feelings--
mike .
what &apos;s your question ?
if your relationship is so much trouble ,
why not just let it go ?
seems impossible that things will ever work out .
look , when you love someone ,
it &apos;s worth fighting for no matter what the odds .
dad , it &apos;s so great to see you .
i wish mom was here too .
well , she may have felt like
a third wheel at a father / daughter dance .
she &apos;s got that charity run this weekend .
yeah . i &apos;m excited to call and find out her times .
usually , it &apos;s the other way around .
your mom &apos;s kicking herself for missing your swim team finals .
yeah , it &apos;s no big deal .
well , it actually kinda was .
well , at least you have maya in the stands cheering for you .
that &apos;s not a good look .
wanna tell me what &apos;s going on ?
maya &apos;s gone .
i caught her doing something
that could get her in a lot of trouble .
instead of listening , i jumped down her throat .
she said she was gonna crash
with some friends in san francisco , so .
i guess that &apos;s where she is .
i just wish she &apos;d call or text me or something
so i &apos;d know for sure .
her parents have no idea where she is ?
well , i know you would feel better if you had more information ,
but it sounds to me like maya wants to stay disconnected .
there &apos;s not a lot of ways that
someone your age can make it to california on their own .
we could check the bus station .
it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s a great way to travel under the radar .
hell , i made it to albuquerque .
you ran away ?
i put your grandparents through hell .
i was , uh , lost in high school .
how long were you gone for ?
oh , just a few days .
long enough to scare &apos;em .
yeah , well , if that &apos;s what maya intended to do ,
it &apos;s definitely working .
hey , come on .
let &apos;s take a look around today , yeah ?
see if we can put your mind at ease .
who knows ? maybe maya decides to come home faster
if she knows the people who care about her are still looking .
hey , you up for a little round robin ?
meeting the gibsons at the club .
um , i would really love to , but i have to study .
you don &apos;t like it , do you ? the necklace ?
i should &apos;ve let you pick something out .
no , dad , i do like it .
i get it . you need your space .
i miss having you out there on the court with me , you know ?
we make such a great team .
okay .
oh , i made dinner reservations at gianni &apos;s .
i know it &apos;s one of your favorites .
7 : 00 good ?
yeah , 7 : 00 is fine .
okay .
will you be gone long ?
um , for a couple hours .
dad ?
oh , hey .
he &apos;s at the club .
i just needed a stamp .
oh , i think i might actually have a stamp in my--
oh . got one .
i &apos;ll see if one of the ticket agents talked to maya .
who was working a couple nights ago ?
excuse me .
she can help you at the next station .
the guard said that you were working a couple of nights ago .
i was .
do you remember seeing this girl ?
sorry .
if you could just tell me .
sorry , miss .
i only have 20 minutes for lunch .
we &apos;re not gonna find anything here .
hold on a second , sweetie .
afternoon , sir .
you commissioned ?
fort hood , texas .
honorable discharge , &apos; 75 .
how can i help you ?
my daughter has got some questions .
a friend of hers is lost .
wanna see if we can bring her back home .
can i see that picture again ?
i did see your friend .
bought a ticket to san fran .
that &apos;s where she went .
where she bought her ticket to .
what do you mean exactly ?
well , i saw her twice that night .
once at the window ,
then about an hour later ,
i was checking a lady &apos;s bags . i saw her standing outside
talking to someone in a dark colored car .
blue , maybe black .
could you see who was driving ?
not really . i turned my back for a minute to load some bags .
when i looked back , both your friend and the car were gone .
do you know if she got on the bus ?
can &apos;t say for sure .
great . she could be anywhere .
thanks for your help , sir .
my pleasure .
that looks nice .
oh , your home .
yeah , you picking something for tonight ?
yup . trying to do my best .
don &apos;t take too long .
i need lead time to make sure my tie matches .
dad , we don &apos;t have to do that this year .
why ? what &apos;s different about this year ?
listen , aria , i know that you and i
have had our problems lately .
but this is--
this is the father / daughter dance ,
and i need to take my little girl .
so , is that too much to ask ?
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m just gonna pick what i &apos;m gonna wear .
voice mailbox full .
where are you going ?
out .
hanna . hanna .
you have one last chance to tell me about that police report .
i already told you .
what you want to tell me .
i &apos;m asking you for the rest .
who it came from ?
and why ?
you need to give me your phone .
what ?
if you &apos;re not gonna give me any answers ,
i &apos;m gonna have to go looking for them myself .
did wilden ask you to--
no , this isn &apos;t about wilden , this is about you and me .
i am trying to help you .
give it to me .
no .
now .
hanna . hanna !
i &apos;m outta here .
your wearing your dress uniform .
isn &apos;t that for special occasions ?
and what &apos;s not special about tonight ?
it would &apos;ve been more special if i &apos;d gotten ready on time .
sort of got hung up at home . maya called .
you talked to her . is she all right ?
she didn &apos;t leave a message .
i wanted to wait and see if she &apos;d call back .
well , at least you heard from her .
it &apos;s just so frustrating .
you made plans for us to hang out ,
and all i wanted to do was look for maya .
now i &apos;m starting to realize it .
maybe she doesn &apos;t want to be found .
i just wish i hadn &apos;t wasted our time together .
how we spend the time doesn &apos;t matter .
i get to spend time with you .
i don &apos;t want you feeling guilty about that .
emmie , i have to be truthful with you .
this may be the last weekend
we get to spend together for a while .
what do you mean ?
they &apos;re sending you back .
afghanistan .
six months .
does mom know ?
she does .
part of the reason why she stayed at home .
to pack up the house .
and she wanted to give us some quality time together .
when do you leave ?
i &apos;m on the last flight out tonight .
deploy out of texas tomorrow morning .
come on .
you look beautiful .
thanks .
hey , later , let &apos;s make sure that we get a photograph , okay ?
of course .
you know , i remember the first time we danced like this .
you were so little , you had to stand on my shoes .
yeah , that was a really long time ago , dad .
yeah . i guess it was .
listen , i &apos;m going to get us something to drink , okay ?
yeah , that sounds good .
okay .
hanna , what &apos;s going on ?
where &apos;s your dress ?
where &apos;s your mom ?
hot on the &quot; a &quot; trail .
um , what does that mean exactly ?
it means she found the police report that &quot; a &quot; sent you .
and she thinks it was sent to me .
she gave it to wilden .
why ?
because she thinks it &apos;s a threat .
it is .
i don &apos;t know , she &apos;s just trying to keep us safe .
yeah , but why wilden ?
hanna , now your mom and my mom are both asking questions about &quot; a. &quot;
and &quot; a &quot; really doesn &apos;t like that .
if they talk to each other--
or if wilden comes up with something ?
what if they end up like--
um , okay .
we need a creative solution .
well , i have an idea .
okay , mona .
it &apos;s gonna require a really big lie and i &apos;m terrible at that .
which one of you girls is best at hiding the truth
from someone who &apos;s close to you ?
her .
wow , really ? thanks , guys .
okay , mona , what &apos;s my lie ?
don &apos;t forget to smile .
thank you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
slow dance is not your need ?
cause i can get the dj to pump up the jams a little if you want .
no , really , come on .
bust and move with your old man .
what do you say ?
spence , i &apos;m really trying here .
a little bit too hard .
wait , wait , spencer .
dad , you kept a huge secret from us .
and i don &apos;t want to do the same thing to you .
i went into your study today when you were at the club .
and you told me that you didn &apos;t pay alison a cent .
because i didn &apos;t .
well , i found a check stub
that would suggest differently .
what check stub ? were you in my desk ?
there was no date on it ,
but i know it was written around the time
of alison &apos;s disappearance .
spencer
$ 15,000 , dad .
exactly the amount that ali had stashed away .
look , i know we have some trust issues right now .
but that didn &apos;t give you the right to go into my desk .
can we not discuss this here ?
i wanna go home .
hey , just in time . it &apos;s almost our turn .
yeah , about that .
do you care if we leave the dance a little bit early ?
early ? - like now ?
um , hanna really needs me .
i just saw hanna . she looked fine .
dad , please .
um , can we at least get a photo first ?
we &apos;ve got one from--
every year , you and your little girl .
i know , but you need to understand something .
i &apos;m not your little girl anymore .
i &apos;m sorry . but i &apos;m not .
toby ?
really amazing what they &apos;ve done in here .
almost forget i &apos;m in a cafeteria .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty .
dad , why didn &apos;t you tell me right when you got here ?
i couldn &apos;t , kiddo .
as much as i was worried about maya , i could &apos;ve handled it .
look , i know you can handle it .
it was more for me ..
i just needed this weekend .
to dance with you .
i have a confession to make .
okay .
i know about tha police report you have .
and i know who sent it to hanna .
you do ?
who ?
me .
you ? why ?
i &apos;ve known for a while now that hanna &apos;s been shoplifting again .
i &apos;m sorry to be the one to have to tell you that .
go on .
well , hanna wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
to any of us when we begged her to stop .
and i know that she &apos;s been caught before
and i--i was just afraid that if she got caught again ,
she could end up in jail .
so , i sent her the report to frighten her .
to try and scare her straight .
how did you get it ?
i made it up . literally .
it &apos;s nice to know my photoshop class finally came in handy .
well , that &apos;s quite a story .
and you &apos;re really the only person involved ?
yup .
i &apos;m &quot; a. &quot;
a for anonymous . a for aria . a for--
i get it .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m so sorry , mrs. marin .
i appreciate you speaking with me , aria .
yeah , well , if there a anything else you need me to do ,
or if there &apos;s--
i think i &apos;ll take it from here .
what else did you touch in here ?
nothing .
spencer , you said
you were in here today . did you open this drawer ?
no , it was locked .
dad ?
yes , hi . i need to report a break in .
the house was locked up tight when we left ,
but there &apos;s a gun missing from my desk .
yes . no , um--
nothing else appears to be stolen .
just the gun .
you have a good time tonight ?
considering it was a father / daughter dance .
yeah . yeah . absolutely .
oh , that &apos;s great .
have you , um , have you seen your sister ?
not yet .
okay . well , good night .
dad ?
do you think maybe you &apos;ve been too hard on aria ?
well , it sounds like you do .
i know that she didn &apos;t tell you the truth
about her and mr. fitz , but did she tell you why ?
no .
maybe because you didn &apos;t ask .
all right , thank you . see you soon .
patrol car will be here shortly .
i gave those pictures to a private investigator .
for reference .
you had her followed .
the check stub you found today ,
written to cash ?
but i thought that--
i know what you thought .
you thought i paid alison &apos;s blackmail .
and i lied to you .
spencer , i hired a private investigator
to look into her disappearance .
why would you spend that much money ?
why would you even care ?
because i thought someone very important to me might be involved .
you changed that will to give jason an alibi .
well , it &apos;s you protecting him .
do you think jason really had something to do with it ?
no , spencer . not jason .
i was worried about your sister .
why ?
melissa was harassing alison .
sending her texts and threats .
and then your friend disappeared .
you don &apos;t think that melissa--
i just needed peace of mind .
and i was willing to pay for answers .
that &apos;s the police .
i think you better go upstairs .
spencer .
sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
why are the cops here ?
i saw dad talking to them outside ?
dad &apos;s gun is missing .
he thinks that somebody broke in .
you didn &apos;t hear anybody , did you ?
no . i fell asleep watching a show in the barn .
lights woke me up a few minutes ago .
i thought that the tv outside is broken .
i don &apos;t know , i was watching it on my laptop .
listen , i gotta go back into the city tonight .
after everything we talked about ;
jason , dad , the blackmail ;
i don &apos;t think i can stay here .
i should get on the road .
but , listen , spencer ,
if things start getting even weirder around here ,
you can always come stay with me .
i want you to know , i &apos;ll keep you safe , okay ?
okay .
bye .
bye .
i didn &apos;t buy it .
i appreciate that , but the fact that aria would make this up .
they &apos;re all making things up .
hiding something or someone .
whoever this &quot; a &quot; person is
has got them completely terrified .
when i saw that police report , i was scared , too .
about a year ago when byron and i were split up ,
this &quot; a &quot; sent something to us too .
they knew things about our family .
what did you do ?
nothing , i mean , i didn &apos;t know what to do .
i do , i got the police involved .
i &apos;m not so sure that &apos;s a good idea .
&quot; a &quot; knows things about aria that could hurt her .
this has gone on for far too long .
we owe it to ourselves and our daughters
to get some answers .
did my mom buy it ?
i have no idea .
do you feel guilty ?
no . yes .
i don &apos;t know .
always a good sign .
aria , what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s jonah .
well , answer it .
hello ?
wait , spence . stop here .
i think this is the block .
welcome to brookhaven .
what did jonah say to you exactly ?
that vivian darkbloom &apos;s friend , alison ,
was receiving texts from more than one number .
