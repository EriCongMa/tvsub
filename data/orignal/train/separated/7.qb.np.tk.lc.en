第五季第十五集
shows your 30,000 votes are fraudulent .
so you want me to bury him ?
do what you want .
i &apos;m not owning this decision .
that is you and jim moody conversing in private .
i &apos;m not interested in you .
i want peter florrick .
all you have to do is testify against him .
did you kill dani littlejohn ?
no .
is there any way your skin could &apos;ve ended up under her fingernails ?
no .
then you &apos;re innocent .
so why do i feel so nervous ?
you all right ?
now , let me tell you exactly what the defense is going to say .
that the dna can &apos;t be trusted .
mr. gardner &apos;s gonna pound his desk and say loudly ,
so that you know that it &apos;s important ,
&quot; garbage in , garbage out . &quot;
well , i &apos;m glad mr. polmar gave you a preview of my defense ,
it &apos;ll save me time .
you &apos;ll notice though ,
that i &apos;m not pounding my desk ,
or yelling wildly .
simple fact is , i don &apos;t need to .
i have a client who is innocent .
mr. grant tried to rape dani littlejohn
and when she resisted , he killed her .
now , how do i know that mr. grant did this ?
there were no video cameras there .
well , luckily , science has provided its own video camera .
in her last desperate moments ,
dani scratched mr. grant ,
leaving his skin under her fingernails .
this young girl &apos;s brave last act
did not save her life ,
but it did catch her killer .
here &apos;s the thing about dna ...
whatever you touch ,
whether you pick up a soda can , or a garden hose ,
you leave a small trace of yourself .
a small trace of your dna .
there , i just left a small trace of my dna .
now , ma &apos;am , if you were to touch it in the same place ,
a small trace of my cells may end up on you .
now , mr. gardner will attempt to explain away this dna
in many exotic ways and in fact ,
like any good defense attorney ,
he will leave this court and argue in another court
that dna is absolutely infallible .
jeffrey never knew dani littlejohn , never met her ,
never even said hello to her on campus .
now , mr. grant and ms. littlejohn , in fact ,
were members of the same off @-@ campus club .
this club , was run by a campus math professor ,
so mr. polmar &apos;s ...
and what about mr. grant &apos;s alibi ?
he was sleeping in his dorm room ...
but no one saw him .
and possibly most damning of all ,
the police arrested someone else for this murder .
objection .
come on up .
that was a little bit unsubtle .
need to keep the jury awake .
you said i couldn &apos;t mention the man &apos;s name , your honor .
no , i said you couldn &apos;t mention the man himself .
your honor , it goes to my theory of the case .
oh , yeah , please , let &apos;s hear the theory of the case .
the police were so embarrassed by arresting the wrong man
a year earlier , they railroaded my client .
no . this isn &apos;t about the cop &apos;s motive ,
this is about you putting doubt in the mind of the jury
and i want you to cut it out .
yes , your honor .
good . now , are you done ?
with my opening argument ? yes , your honor .
good . now , step the hell back .
you should &apos;ve taken the plea , will .
okay . we &apos;re gonna recess for lunch .
i &apos;ll see you back here in 90 minutes .
jeffrey , remember what i said .
it &apos;s a marathon , it &apos;s not a sprint .
they think i &apos;m guilty .
everyone will take you &apos;re guilty
until i present my evidence .
hold it together and don &apos;t look away ,
you meet their eyes .
everything all right ?
i was just thinking , none of this existed six months ago .
yeah ... it &apos;s a real firm .
thank you .
for ?
making me do this .
alicia ?
i &apos;m seeing kalinda .
you &apos;re ... ? - yeah .
okay .
now , she &apos;s trying to dig up stuff on our firm ...
so ...
i thought i should come clean to you .
okay . but ...
you &apos;re not giving her anything ?
no . no . no .
good .
you look concerned .
um ... no , i just thought ...
when you say you &apos;re seeing her ... ?
i thought she was gay .
bi ... or something .
good . none of my business .
you think this is the way will and diane talk ?
we just need a shot of bourbon .
i &apos;ll get some .
what ?
justice .
you want me to stay ?
no . that &apos;s okay .
mr. dubeck , hello .
mrs. florrick .
i hope you don &apos;t mind this small interruption .
would it matter if i did ?
it would matter to me .
i won &apos;t take a minute . i @-@ i won &apos;t even sit .
sondra , can you call this phone in five minutes
and let me know i have a phone call ?
that isn &apos;t necessary .
you represented your husband , the governor ,
in the legal matters surrounding his election ?
i think you know that i did .
yes . i know you did .
given that , the office of public integrity
is investigating matters having to do with a stuffed ballot box .
a ballot box i knew nothing about .
a ballot box you argued for in court .
no , i argued against .
then argued for .
which is why i advise you
to submit to a voluntary deposition .
really ?
you advise me ?
you did nothing wrong .
your husband did nothing wrong .
the best way to clear this up is to speak on the record .
or you &apos;ll leak it to the press ?
no .
but ... i do have a witness who will go on the record .
another lawyer .
who ?
will gardner .
i doubt that .
if i were you , i would get on the record first .
here &apos;s my card .
call me by this time tomorrow .
i think that &apos;s your fictional call .
talk to you soon .
we can claim with 99.9 percent certainty
that this dna comes from mr. grant .
and did you find any other evidence of dna
around or on the body ?
no . only mr. grant &apos;s .
and the quantity of the dna under the victim &apos;s fingernails
was consistent ...
with a defensive struggle ?
that is correct .
and you &apos;d be able to ... ?
where &apos;d you get it ?
campus security .
they were sympathetic .
kalinda , i could kiss you .
not here .
listen , i @-@ i need to talk to you later .
sure , about what ?
later .
so , mr. vail ...
actually , dr. vail .
my apologies , dr. vail .
you have no doubt about the providence of this dna ?
with all dna work , sir , we leave ourselves a degree of doubt ...
but the doubt here is 0.00001 .
thank you , sir .
and now i believe mr. gardner
would like to talk to you about touch dna .
i do ! thank you , finn .
now that the prosecutor has brought it up ,
what is touch dna ?
dna that is transferred via skin cells
when an object is handled or touched .
and how many skin cells does a person shed every day ?
approximately 400,000 skin cells .
wow ... that &apos;s a lot .
so , if i handled this book on my desk ,
introduction to litigation ... it was a gift from mr. polmar ...
well , you told me you &apos;d finally read it .
now , if i handled this book ...
and i hand it to you ...
am i transferring cells ?
you could be .
you would have to hold it for some time
and it would be a better absorbent
if the cover were cloth .
as this one is ?
yes .
that would transfer your cells .
your honor , i &apos;ve had some late arriving evidence
and unfortunately , i haven &apos;t had time to put it on slides .
that &apos;s all right .
we can struggle without technology today .
the last day of dani littlejohn &apos;s life ,
she checked out a research book
from her advanced sociology class .
this is her at 3 : 25 p.m. ,
as seen from the library surveillance cameras .
do you see her there ?
i do .
now ,
this was a book
all the sociology classes needed to share ,
so a student couldn &apos;t take it out of the library ,
they had to return it after reading the chapter ...
mr. gardner appears to be testifying here ,
your honor .
he does at that .
is there a question
swimming around in all those statements ?
yes , your honor .
a few hours earlier , at 12 : 39,
the same book was checked out by this person .
do you recognize him ?
it looks like jeffrey grant .
it is , actually .
now , this sociology book ,
an old book , had a cloth cover .
is it possible , that the dna at question here ,
was transferred via the cloth cover of this book ?
it could , but to get under the victim &apos;s fingernails ,
she would &apos;ve had to grip the book quite tightly .
yes , but as you say , it &apos;s possible .
it &apos;s certainly possible .
can you see that , mr. polmar ?
i can , mr. gardner , thank you .
he wanted an answer in 24 hours ?
or he &apos;ll depose will .
it &apos;s a bluff .
will won &apos;t break attorney @-@ client privilege .
what if they offer him immunity ?
for what ?
conspiracy to commit voter fraud .
he saw a videotape .
he argued against the votes , too .
yeah , but he buried that video .
i think i should do it .
the voluntary deposition ?
it &apos;s the only way to control the questions .
i &apos;m in my rights to answer any questions
i want and refuse any due to attorney @-@ client privilege .
even if i refuse to answer any questions ,
i will know what he &apos;s asking will .
good , good .
do you need a lawyer ?
no , i have cary .
cary agos ?
you sure he &apos;s up to it ?
he &apos;s up to it .
what do you have ?
me ? nothing . you know ,
just a song in my heart .
damn it .
thank you for returning , doctor .
now , if you wanted to avoid leaving touch dna ,
how could you do it ?
if i wanted to avoid it ?
well , the best way would be to
remove the top layer of dead cells on your skin .
through washing hands ?
yes .
or some kind of solvent or alcohol @-@ based cleanser .
or chlorine ?
yes . a chlorine @-@ based wash would be quite effective .
wouldn &apos;t chlorine also be effective at washing away
any result from touch dna ?
yes , it would .
my apologies , your honor .
this evidence arrived so late ,
i , too , didn &apos;t have time to transfer it to a monitor .
it &apos;s like perry mason here with all this late @-@ arriving stuff .
go ahead .
would you please tell me who you see in this photo , sir ?
it looks like the victim , dani littlejohn .
it is in fact . at the college swimming pool .
could you tell me the timecode
of the campus surveillance camera ?
it says 5 : 12 ... - p.m. , that &apos;s right .
so this would be after
mr. gardner &apos;s library photo of ms. littlejohn
handling the cloth sociology book ?
yes , an hour and a half later .
let me take this by the jury .
so , if ms. littlejohn went swimming in a chlorinated pool ,
after she &apos;d handled the book positively doused
with touch dna , would that eliminate any effects
of touch dna on her body ?
it would , definitely .
and so the dna underneath ms. littlejohn &apos;s fingernails
would still most likely come
from a defensive wound that night .
objection ! beyond the scope .
sure , you can have that one . sustained .
did you have any more questions ?
it &apos;s my fault . i should have checked .
we gotta start over .
how did his dna end up on her ?
okay , i &apos;m on it .
it &apos;s somewhere in here .
dani littlejohn got out of the campus pool at 5 : 12 .
jeffrey grant &apos;s card key has him entering
his dorm room at 7 : 49 p.m.
they had to cross somewhere in there .
kalinda ?
so grant had his baseball game at 6 : 30 .
he was injured at 7 : 00 . went to the emergency room
and was released at 7 : 30 .
did they cross at the hospital ?
uh , there was no record of dani visiting the hospital .
so beat the bushes .
what were dani littlejohn &apos;s exact movements
from her swim until the time of her death ?
and how could jeffrey have crossed with her ?
let &apos;s go !
you &apos;re starting over ?
we had a setback .
we &apos;re putting eight associates on it ?
yes .
hold on , kalinda .
what about the earlier suspect , the professor ?
dr. delaney ? the judge won &apos;t allow any mention of him .
do we think he did it ?
who , jeffrey ?
no , the professor .
do we think jeffrey did it ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
well , what is the plea on the table ?
it &apos;s off the table . jeffrey rejected it .
what was the plea on the table ?
eight years .
you think i &apos;ve lost my perspective ?
no , i just think eight years is preferable to life .
jeffrey is 21 .
he &apos;ll be out before his 30th birthday .
he rejected it .
i better go .
no , you &apos;re fine , kalinda .
well , your defense seems
to be taking for granted his innocence .
what if he &apos;s not ? what &apos;s your fallback ?
the jury believed touch dna .
they looked at jeffrey and they wanted
to believe he didn &apos;t do it .
all we need to do is hint at cross between jeffrey
and the victim somewhere
where his dna could have ended up on her .
this isn &apos;t a crusade , diane .
i like the kid .
i think he &apos;s innocent .
i feel bad he &apos;s having the crap beaten out of him in holding ,
but i &apos;m playing this smart .
okay . tell me if you need my help .
i &apos;ll be in the courtroom down from yours .
on what ?
the hedge fund ... vonerich . another dui .
keeping the world safe for drunk ceos .
it &apos;s my new motto .
are , uh , are they okay ? jeffrey &apos;s parents ?
i understand , mr. grant ,
i know , but your son is mid @-@ trial .
the grants . their son ... they want a second opinion .
uh , no , i &apos;m sorry . look , will gardner is
lockhart / gardner &apos;s top litigator .
no , i &apos;m sorry , sir , but you &apos;re in good hands .
thank you .
wow , you were laying it on thick .
just cooling things down .
so ... will you ?
you want me as your lawyer ?
yeah .
why ? you sound incredulous .
wouldn &apos;t you want me as your lawyer ?
i &apos;m joking , i &apos;m joking !
yes !
yes .
i &apos;ll arrange a date and time for the deposition .
good .
i have the correspondents &apos; luncheon tomorrow .
sometime before that ?
okay .
where you going ?
court .
you offering a second opinion ?
you were with dani on that last day swimming , right ?
i was .
and afterward .
what did you guys do afterward ?
she met me at the study hall .
you ever see this person there ?
no , but it &apos;s a big campus .
of course .
and do you know where dani went after that ?
no . she just finished her coffee and headed off .
uh , coffee ? she had a coffee ?
like a starbucks coffee ?
no , a campus one .
okay , kalinda , thanks . keep on it .
jeffrey , we may have a lead on dani &apos;s whereabouts .
we think she was buying coffee at the campus coffee shop
on 5 : 30 or so . were you there ?
let me say this before you answer .
we need to find someplace your touch dna could &apos;ve ended up
under dani &apos;s fingernails after her swimming ,
and all we can find is this coffee shop .
so i have to ask you again ,
were you in this coffee shop around that time ?
it makes sense that you would be .
i &apos;m gonna say yes . i don &apos;t remember .
but you might have ?
i might have .
good . let me run with that .
the more you firm up your memory the better .
you still having trouble in holding ?
yeah .
i can talk to someone .
no , they &apos;ll just put me in solitary .
i &apos;d kill myself in solitary .
this is the dorm here .
mr. grant &apos;s dorm ?
yes . and the body was discovered here .
now , you found that mr. grant &apos;s card key had logged him in
7 : 49 p.m. , but the murder didn &apos;t happen until 9 : 15 .
how do you explain this ?
this door here , it &apos;s a fire exit ,
but students keep it propped open with a chair .
this is how mr. grant could have had access to the crime scene
while bypassing the card key system .
and did you check out mr. grant &apos;s alibi ?
that he was in his dorm room sleeping ?
yes , there were no witnesses .
thank you , detective . nothing further .
detective , why did it take you a year
to catch my client ?
why ? we were being careful .
but you must &apos;ve questioned students in this dorm
building with the propped @-@ open door ?
no .
you didn &apos;t ? why was that ?
we were pursuing another lead .
i see .
so it took you a year to find my client .
well , you must have been very busy .
yes , we were .
you were busy with other cases ?
and this case .
it takes you a while to clear cases , is that it ?
look , we had someone else in our sights .
objection , your honor . relevance .
i didn &apos;t bring it up !
he cowed the witness into defending ...
i didn &apos;t cow anyone ! he volunteered !
come on up .
the witness brought up the other suspect
to defend his inactivity .
after being badgered ,
your honor .
i would agree , mr. polmar ,
but it &apos;s now part of detective rodriguez &apos;s testimony .
thank you , your honor .
don &apos;t suck up . step back .
detective ,
who was this first suspect you pursued ?
dr. stephan delaney .
he &apos;s a math professor at chicago poly @-@ tech .
i see . and why did you first suspect him ?
what &apos;s going on ?
the grants called me for a second opinion on your trial .
you &apos;re kidding me .
no . i told them no .
then why are you here ?
i decided to warn you .
i was thinking if i was in your shoes
and i had a client calling behind my back ,
i would want to know .
alicia .
thanks .
hey , we might have our differences ,
but you &apos;re the better lawyer .
i am , aren &apos;t i ?
and the more humble .
mr. and mrs. grant ,
if you want another lawyer , i &apos;ll get you a list of other lawyers ,
but don &apos;t go behind my back .
not during trial . do you understand ?
we were just nervous .
i understand that . we all are . do you want to make a change ?
no .
no .
good .
thank you , dr. delaney .
now , why did dani littlejohn stop coming to your b @-@ plus club ?
well , she stopped getting b @-@ pluses .
and did she express her worry about another student in the club ?
yes . jeffrey grant .
that is such a lie .
mr. grant ,
not another word .
our apologies , your honor .
but mr. grant insists
that he never met dani littlejohn .
to your knowledge , would that be false ?
i &apos;m sorry , but to my knowledge that is false .
they were both in my b @-@ plus club
and , i believe , socialized there .
now , let me just ask you this question ,
because i know mr. gardner &apos;s chomping at the bit
and i don &apos;t want to disappoint him .
did you kill dani littlejohn ?
no .
but the police questioned you .
yes .
i was the last one to see her .
alive .
she was in my study group .
but you have an alibi ?
yes .
at the time of dani &apos;s death ,
i was with my ex @-@ wife .
your ex @-@ wife .
thank you , dr. delaney .
校园咖啡店
oh , yeah .
that &apos;s ... that girl ...
dani littlejohn .
right .
uh , do you remember the day she died ?
oh , yeah . last year .
that was ... awful .
she used to come in a lot .
and you were working that afternoon .
uh , yeah .
1 : 00 @-@ 7 : 00 .
right .
what time did she come in ?
dani ?
yeah .
uh , she didn &apos;t come in . not that day .
she didn &apos;t come in ?
uh ... look , are you sure ?
because we have someone who witnessed her
with a coffee cup that came from here .
yeah , i saw her standing outside ,
but a friend of hers brought her the coffee .
do you remember seeing this student out there , too ?
yeah , i know him .
but he wasn &apos;t outside with her .
but you can &apos;t be sure .
no , i &apos;m ... pretty sure .
right .
sorry .
i can lie , if you want .
if you want me to say i saw them together .
it &apos;s fine .
will , it &apos;s bad news .
did you check the surveillance video ?
yeah .
littlejohn &apos;s roommate went into the coffee shop ...
she stayed outside .
maybe she ran into jeffrey outside .
will ...
i think he did it .
the murder weapon , the cinder block ...
how much did it weigh ?
about 18 pounds .
check with jeffrey &apos;s doctor .
he was injured pitching that night , right ?
the doctor who examined him .
maybe he couldn &apos;t lift it .
okay , i &apos;ll ask .
good .
what &apos;s up with you ?
you wanted to talk ?
yeah .
how long do you need to replace me ?
how long do i need ?
you &apos;re leaving ?
yeah .
you going to florrick @-@ agos ?
no .
then what ?
just , i wanted to ...
i don &apos;t know , wanted to do something different .
what , farming ?
will , i don &apos;t want to be doing this for the next 20 years .
this isn &apos;t about money ?
nope .
is it about alicia ?
is ... what ?
her leaving .
no .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna be honest .
you know this is crap .
i know this is crap .
every few months , you do this .
and this time , i am serious .
you and i were built for this , kalinda .
it &apos;s what we do .
now , we can look at normal people
and want to be like them ...
but we can &apos;t , really .
is that supposed to be a pep talk ?
because it &apos;s terrible .
okay , look ...
you take a few months off .
go have a life .
but i &apos;m telling you right now :
you will be bored sick .
life is overrated , and
you &apos;ll miss it .
that feeling you get
when you figure something out ...
you live for that .
anyway ... i &apos;ll miss you .
there aren &apos;t many people i like left .
there .
was that a better pep talk ?
it &apos;s okay .
you want a hug ?
stupid .
good morning , mrs. florrick .
mr. dubeck .
according to our pre @-@ agreed ground rules ,
i will be taping
this deposition ...
voluntary deposition .
yes . voluntary deposition .
and we &apos;ve agreed to review and correct any mistakes
in the fine copy .
and ...
i will be taping this interview , also .
good .
so , then , we &apos;re ...
all ready ?
we seem to be .
okay . did you discuss
your voluntary deposition
with anyone before today ?
yes .
who ?
eli gold ,
my husband , governor peter florrick ,
and my lawyer , cary agos .
did you discuss it with will gardner , too ?
no .
really ?
because you were observed
meeting with will gardner yesterday ,
tuesday the 15th , at the criminal courthouse .
i was &quot; observed &quot; ?
yes .
when i was being followed ,
i was &quot; observed &quot; ?
yes . mm @-@ hmm .
and for how long have i been being ... &quot; observed &quot; ?
35 hours .
and will i continue to be &quot; observed &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
i will be readying
an order of protection right after this meeting .
good .
so you met with will gardner yesterday ,
but you did not discuss your testimony with him ?
her &quot; interview &quot; with him .
that &apos;s correct .
i didn &apos;t discuss it .
what did you discuss ?
his current murder trial .
i told him
that the parents of his client
came to me for a second opinion .
when your men are trailing me
and they &apos;re too far away to hear ,
just have them signal
and i &apos;ll talk louder .
did will gardner show you this videotape ?
no . he didn &apos;t ?
no .
you &apos;ll have to excuse my incredulity ,
but it seems to me that you and mr. gardner share ...
almost everything .
your incredulity ...
is excused .
do you have any other questions ,
mr. dubeck , or is that it ?
i was just giving mrs. florrick
a chance to reconsider her response .
no , i &apos;m good .
you and mr. gardner are lovers , isn &apos;t that correct ?
excuse me . what does that have to do with anything ?
the relationship between two lawyers
on governor florrick &apos;s legal team
bears a direct relationship to ... - no .
no , it does not .
and i &apos;m calling a halt to this interview right now .
it &apos;s okay , cary .
mr. dubeck ...
i &apos;ve been at this now for five years .
investigations , recriminations ,
personal questions , innuendo .
and every time ...
every single time ...
i know the investigator is in trouble
when he makes it personal ...
just as you did now .
i know that he doesn &apos;t have the facts .
you &apos;re losing , mr. dubeck .
any other questions ?
yes , jeffrey grant , the guy on trial .
he was in here .
and you treated him ?
yes , i treated him . why ?
he had a sprain ?
oh , yes , he was in quite a bit of pain .
his right arm .
do you think he could &apos;ve lifted this ?
it &apos;s about 18 pounds .
mm , he might be able to ,
with difficulty .
it would be painful .
is this about the murder ?
yeah .
i treated her that night , too .
sorry , you ...
you treated ... dani littlejohn ?
yes .
you treated both dani and jeffrey ?
yes .
excuse me .
okay , sir , now , this may hurt .
i know .
i &apos;m sorry . let &apos;s get him up to x ray on the third floor ,
and then we &apos;ll determine if he needs to go to surgery or not . um ...
doctor ...
sorry , doctor .
when jeffrey was brought in here ,
did you examine him in here ?
sorry , i &apos;m a little busy .
just one question .
was jeffrey examined in the emergency room ?
uh , yes .
right . and dani littlejohn ...
when she was brought in , where was she ?
in the operating theatre downstairs .
yeah , but was she ever on any of these beds ?
we change the sheets on these beds after every patient .
i understand that , but is @-@ is there any way , doctor ,
that jeffrey &apos;s sheets from earlier on that night
could &apos;ve come into contact with dani ?
no .
would you excuse me ?
look ... check the paramedic .
the same one that brought in jeffrey grant for his sprain
brought in littlejohn later that night .
thank you .
so the first time you discovered
there were 30,000 votes
in that ballot box for your husband
was in court , on the eve of the election .
no .
then when did you first discover it ?
i never discovered it .
there was never 30,000 votes for my husband .
oh , i see .
then when did you first discover there were ...
28,158 votes for your husband ?
when you showed me the video .
and when did you first see this video ?
what is this video ?
another surveillance video .
this one &apos;s from the 23rd precinct , early voting .
um , i &apos;ve never seen that video
until this moment .
and this video ?
just to clarify ,
this is the very first time
mrs. florrick has seen these videos
and we have no knowledge what they signify .
they signify that mr. florrick stole an election .
this is not about 30,000 votes .
this was a conspiracy .
a conspiracy of middle men , sir .
peter had no knowledge of these actions .
alicia ...
well , that &apos;s the question , isn &apos;t it ?
what did the governor know , when did he know it ?
that &apos;s what makes will gardner &apos;s testimony so interesting .
he took this video to the governor ,
and the governor did nothing .
thank you so much . and alicia is needed
at a correspondents &apos; luncheon .
you can bury your head in the sand , mrs. florrick ,
but once will gardner testifies ,
the dominoes will start falling .
alicia , this way .

when you start talking about medical marijuana ...
hello ?
you &apos;re the one who went to the judge
insisting the deposition could only be today .
so let &apos;s get the judge on the line !
but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna be in a giving mood .
what do you want ?
i want to get out my aggressions and my anger
by destroying your client .

i said sit the hell down .
i don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;m making an executive decision .
i &apos;m the ranking partner here .

we &apos;re heading for a lot of hurt .
oh , wait a minute .
sorry , i ...

if you think your life would &apos;ve been better with will ,
you are kidding yourself .
stop it , peter !
no , i &apos;m not gonna let you throw away this marriage
because you have some idealized notion of a man
who you &apos;re not even sure cared about you !
you &apos;re a bastard .
and you &apos;re a selfish bitch ,
but you know what ? !
we &apos;re all that we have .
you &apos;re gonna have to learn to trust me real quick .
i &apos;m the new will .
you &apos;re not the new will .
