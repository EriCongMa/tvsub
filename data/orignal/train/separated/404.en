Son of a bitch!
Did he bite you?
Yeah. Don't move.
Dale Schrader You are under arrest for the murder of Stacy Ryan
And a kidnapping of your daughter Jenny.
Listen we got him.
No I'm afraid please let me see my mum.
No your mum...
Where is she?
Your mum...she is gonna meet you at the hospital.
And...And he can not hurt you.
You are gonna be fine.
Let me say good bye to her.
You've lost that right the minute you took her.
She is my daughter.
Jenny.
No no no...it's ok it's ok.
He can't hurt you.
Jenny I'm sorry.
You are gonna ride in with her?
Yeah I got it.
Jenny listen to me.
I promise you he is gonna go away for a long time.
It's gonna be alright.
Hey Morgan is gonna waite for the ambulance
Bunting and I are taking him in.
Yeah no the cabin is empty.
Yeah cancel the amber alert.
Copy that. Truck recovered?
Negative on the truck.
The girl is upset but she seems ok.
Agent Morgan is gonna bring her in.
He's gonna escort her in the ambulance.
They should be leaving in a couple minutes.
Wanna talk to your mom?
Mom?
No I'm ok I promise.
Killed a random woman and kidnapped this kid
Use the same track
Not the brightest bulb.
He's been locked up for 11 years he is out of practice.
Don't they say these guys come out better criminals?
Smart ones do.
You saying I'm dumb?
You're impatient angry.
You took your own kid just to get back at your ex.
You got it all figured out.
Well your ex-wife said...- She was a liar.
And I should have killed her.
Like you killed Stacy Ryan?
Why did you do it?
You wouldn't understand.
Try me.
Here's what I don't get about this guy.
What's that?
His whole life he's a thief
He comes out of prison and murderer.
He killed an innocent woman.
How do you know she's innocent?
You stabbed her and threw her out of a truck.
What the hell did she ever do to you?
You know what I don't get
Is why you couldn't just appreciate the freedom.
You could have holed up in that cabin a long time
Enjoyed the quiet.
But some people just need the distractions.
You probably got used to
All that madness when you were locked up.
It's madness for the sheep to talk peace with a wolf.
That sounds like something my daddy would say.
Thomas Fuller.
You Impressed?
I'm surprised.
So you're the wolf.
You have no idea.
There it is.
That ego.
You know for one second
You were unpredictable.
But you can't help yourself. You gotta talk a big talk.
But just so you know that's boring.
Hey what was that?
Sit up.
Oh I'm gonna be sick.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I'm gonna pull over.
Oh I'm gonna be sick.
Can you turn the light on?
I'm gonna be sick.
Oh what the hell?
Ohh! Am I still boring?
What?
Am I boring?!
Where are the keys? Uhh!
Oh wait! I'm a federal agent!
I have a prisoner in here who's just killed this officer!
I knew it. You are one committed son of a bitch.
Oh my arm.- No no that's the prisoner!
What are you doing?
Uhh! Give me the gun.
What?
What's wrong with you?
You killed a cop?
Give me the gun.
She's a fed.
Look she knows there's two of us now.
You're gonna need stitches.
I'm not going to the hospital.
There's a lot of blood. Put pressure on it.
Give me the gun.
You're gonna be all right.
Come on give me the damn gun!
Get in the truck! Come on!
Come on!
"Men are more ready to repay an injury than a benefit
Because gratitude is a burden and revenge a pleasure."
Tacitus.
Pull over. That's one of us. Pull over.
Prentiss!
Ohh. What the hell happened? Are you all right?
Bunting's down there. He's dead.
Where's Schrader?
He's gone.
It was a...a big...
Truck New York tags
Uh victor alpha 737.
They went northbound about 10 minutes ago.
Son of a bitch got away.
He's got a partner.
First case back we won
And you'll be home for breakfast.
We never figured out
why schrader killed Stacy Ryan.
She had no connection to his daughter or his ex-Wife.
There's been an accident.
Emily's in the hospital Bunting's dead.
Is she all right?
She has a concussion.
Is Morgan with her?
Yeah.
Where's Schrader?
Northbound in a truck.
A truck?
He has a partner.
What?
We need roadblocks now.
Do we have a tag?
Uh Emily murmured a partial.
Better than nothing.
He could be headed to Canada.
We need somebody who knows the area.
I'll get an officer.
And JJ...
Yeah you want Schrader's face everywhere.
Schrader was a bank robber.
Now he's murdered a woman
Kidnapped his daughter and killed a cop.
He's obviously more sophisticated
Than we originally thought.
He's got a bigger plan. It's not just about
Getting his daughter and fleeing the country.
We never profiled that he'd have a partner.
We don't know this guy at all.
Got to admit you're better than I thought.
Those idiots don't know what hit them.
Sit still.
At least give me some aspirin.
Oh! Come on. Really?
Oh man. Are you done yet?
We gotta go.
I don't have the key.
What?
My contact wasn't there.
Her shift starts at 8:00.
Tomorrow? so we're just gonna wait?
You know this wouldn't be such a big deal if you hadn't killed a cop.
Oh he didn't know when to shut up.
You know what's gonna happen now?
They're gonna put your picture everywhere.
They're gonna triple patrol.
You just screwed your chances of ever getting out of here.
Well see that's where you come in.
I got faith in you.
Is this gonna leave a scar?
No we gotta find Schrader.
The team's got it covered.
Don't make me stay here.
I'm fine honestly. Pull this thing over.
Prentiss you can't even focus.
You have a concussion.
I saw the guy.
White 40s I know.
Ok so give me a cognitive interview.
Your adrenaline's pumping.
Exactly.
Emily you're in shock.
It just happened. It'll never be clearer.
How many shots did you fire?
3.
You emptied your clip.
No...
I did?
All right so Schrader pulled a series of bank heists
In the 1990s.
He was the only one to ever go away for the crimes.
He was a model prisoner only served 11 of his 15 years
Was released early on good behavior
And any friends he had are either dead or still in prison.
A 3-ton truck was found north of the accident
Not too far from Canada.
We have the heaviest presence at border crossings.
He probably knows that.
I don't think he's gonna sit still for long.
He might have to depending on how injured he is.
What do we know?
Dale Schrader went to prison for robbery.
He was hands off. All of his crimes were impersonal.
2 days after he's released he kills Stacy Ryan
And he Kidnaps his daughter.
It's both personal and emotional.
When he's not attached to the crime he pulls it off
But the minute he's invested like with his daughter
He lets his guard down and gets caught. it makes sense.
So he's not the hard-ass we thought he was.
But if Jenny were what he wanted
He had her. He could have left.
Yeah we thought he took her and ran to Canada right?
That theory made sense. why didn't he?
Pictures from the accident.
Any word on Emily?
Apparently she's arguing with the doctors.
That's good.
Let's took a look to pull off.
What if he's got a group of guys to call on?
I agree. All those bank jobs were a solo
But this is a lot for one man to orchestrate.
Figured out why he killed Stacy Ryan?
We haven't found any connection to Schrader
But he may be connected to the partner.
How?
Killing her might have been advance payment
For breaking him out of custody.
Garcia
i need everything you've got on Stacy Ryan.
What do you mean he got away?
Somebody broke him out of custody.
Oh god.
We're gonna keep the two of you here.
There's gonna be an officer standing watch the entire time.
If you can't find him how long will you keep us safe?
Ma'am we will find him.
You don't know Dale. When he wants something he gets it.
Can you think of anyone at all who might want to help him?
He doesn't trust anybody.
It's not necessarily about trust.
Maybe somebody who's indebted to him
And he was trying to collect on it?
I don't know.
Jenny...
You and your Dad were alone the entire time?
Nobody was in the truck or the cabin?
Nobody.
Who would do this for Dale?
Who would risk everything to help him?
That's what we need to find out.
Stacy Ryan had two times in her life--
When she was high and when she was waiting to get high.
The only thread I have between them
Is that her brother spent time with Schrader
upstate like... 5 years ago.
Why would Schrader kill a Junkie?
It doesn't make sense.
Where's the brother now?
Dead.
It doesn't feel like Schrader does anything randomly.
Stacy must have meant something to him.
Yeah but...what?
Never mind I see her.
I can take her from here. thanks.
Thank you.
I can walk.
Sit.
I like pushing you around.
Does it hurt?
If by "it" you mean my entire body then yes.
Did Jenny see anything?
She never saw the partner.
Oh what the hell?
They found a truck ditched a few miles from the accident.
Plates were missing
but the front end definitely a stole a truck
Ok so the partner saw everything in the woods
He ran away and stole a truck?
Who is this guy?
He knew you were taking that road back to the station.
He waited for you and he crashed into you.
This whole thing feels meticulous.
Ok so he needs the partner for something else.
For what though?
Well I don't know. I mean he was locked up all this time.
He planned the whole day.
He should have had backup plans for his backup plans.
His ex shouldn't have been home for a few hours
So he clearly had enough time
To get across the border with Jenny until we showed up.
But he stayed local holed up in that cabin.
He had what he wanted. He could have just run.
There's gotta be something else keeping him in Lockport.
I couldn't stop him from choking Bunting.
Emily don't do that.
He was right there.
Schrader's face is all over the news.
He's been on the run for almost 2 hours
And we're no closer to catching him.
We need to find the partner.
Hey. how are you?
I feel like I got hit by a truck.
Here sit.
Thanks.
Uh Garcia tell everyone what you just told me.
I have unearthed more of Schrader's past.
Now what we do know is that he robbed 15 banks
In the state of New York in the Nineties.
However what your resident glamour-puss smarty-pants just find out
Was that most of that money was never recovered.
Where is it?
My best guess-- only he knows.
Good reason to stick around Lockport.
The last robbery the one that put him away
Should have been routine right? So what happened?
Maybe someone turned him in.
He kept to himself always worked alone.
Who'd turn him in?
We're missing somebody.
Garcia.
Yes checking sir.
What's this all about?
Nothing to do till morning.
What's your problem?
Hesitation puts obstacles in the path.
Boldness eliminates them.
Boldness strikes fear.
Fear creates authority.
"The 48 Laws of Power." You know it?
You want to shoot me?
Have I said thanks yet?
Ok. Records leading up to Schrader's arrest
Show this other bank robber
Named Dan Otey.
And he was looking at copious amounts of time then he strikes a deal
and all of a sudden Schrader is arrested.
It can't be a coincidence.
You know it's not uncommon for criminals to buy jobs off one another.
Maybe that's what Schrader did
But Dan Otey sold him out for a lesser sentence.
It doesn't make sense.
Otey was a rat and now he's the partner?
Yeah you're right.
Schrader wouldn't trust him.
If anything he'd want him dead.
Probably but he'd use him first.
He'd tell Otey that he owes him one
And that he might save his life if he helps him get out of this jam.
Where's he now Garcia?
Uh Dan Otey is a local.
He lives off of Route 7.
Nobody's here. Let's go.
Is your daddy home?
Who are you?
Close the door!
Don't do this.
Calm down. I'm just gonna scare him a little bit.
Hey Dan!
You sent your son to the door?
Coward!
His wife and son were home.
Are they ok?
The partner took them upstairs
while Schrader destroyed the place.
Emily is with the wife right now.
Dan had turned everything around.
He was clean life was finally good.
But I was always afraid to believe it you know?
Because then he could be taken away.
I'm so sorry.
The other man-- What did he look like?
Uh white...
Mid-40s...
Short hair...
I don't know.
Had you ever seen him before?
Dale yeah. The other guy no.
We're trying to figure out how Schrader knows his partner.
I have no idea.
How did they talk to each other?
They didn't.
Dale trashed the place
And the other guy took us upstairs.
He kept pushing me and...Jason.
I didn't know what was gonna happen.
Did he hurt you?
He just scared us. He locked us in the back room.
He locked you in the room and that's it?
Yeah.
He told us to shut up and keep it locked.
But Jason wouldn't stop crying.
This wasn't the deal.
Really?
I didn't sign up to kill anybody.
You saved my ass.
You pulled me out of that car remember?
Then people died.
I can't do it. I won't.
Yes you will.
You terrorized that family. You killed their father.
Don't worry. The kid is young.
He won't remember him.
I also killed that cop. Don't forget about him.
You enjoyed it.
Yes I did. And you didn't stop me.
Ooh...I get it.
Ohh...you gotta do what you gotta do.
And I want what I want.
Come on bro.
Almost done.
Schrader gets off on power.
That and money are what motivate him.
And revenge.
11 years away he comes out a murderer.
Who needs a partner somebody as bold as him.
And where'd they meet?
Schrader was away and patient.
The minute he got out he hooked up with his partner first
And then he killed Stacy Ryan
On his way to kidnap his daughter.
What's missing from his day?
The money.
He took his daughter but left the money.
That doesn't make any sense.
Did he have another plan on how to support himself in Canada?
He's only known a life of crime.
He's incapable of change.
Time away proved that.
Well Otey's wife said that the partner locked them away
Like he didn't want them to get hurt.
He was protective. That's weird right?
They're both dominant personalities
But they sound like they played good cop/bad cop.
Well it's been 4 hours since the accident.
You still think I'm in shock?
There's one way to find out.
Ok. First thing
We go to the station gonna get the key.
Then we go to the bank which opens at 9:00.
Then we're done.
It's not that easy. I told you.
Not for me.
But you-- Everybody loves you.
Ok I do this. Then what?
Then it's over.
No.
No?
No. There's no version of me surviving this.
You get what you want I'm dead.
Well if you believe that do it.
Go ahead. You can stop this right now.
You want me dead. How bad?
Come on. Kill me.
What?
You need my help? Is that what you need?
You know I'm not gonna stop this
until I get what I want.
I'm not gonna stop it but you can.
You want to end it? Then do it. End it.
Come on. Do it.
Take a chance that this all works out for you. Come on!
Come on! Do it!
Come on! Come on!
End it! Do it! Come on! Do it!
That's what I thought.
It's not in you Joey. Never was.
All right take a deep breath Prentiss.
Let's just do this.
All right.
Tell me what you saw. Was it dark?
Yeah. You were there. You know it was.
Come on now.
Ok.
What did it smell like inside the car?
Sweat.
So you were hot?
Yeah. I--I opened the window a little bit.
It's really quiet.
Are there any other cars on the road?
There's one coming.
What color is it?
I...It's too bright.
Ok but you looked at it. You saw it.
It's a 4-Door hybrid black.
Where was Schrader?
He's looking out the window.
Was he waiting for something?
Here comes another car.
A car or the truck?
It's the truck.
Schrader sees it.
That's when it happens. He's...out of his seatbelt.
He's hunched over.
And he gets his cuffs out in front of him.
Ok then what?
Uh Bunting pulled over
And--and Schrader put his seatbelt back on.
He knew it was coming.
Where did the truck come from?
Uh behind us. Uh no--
Uh...it was in front of us.
Who was driving Prentiss?
I don't know. I can't see.
Ok. It's all right it's all right.
You're sure it was the truck?
Yeah. It's a big truck.
Think. Who was driving?
Who was driving?
A white male 40s.
All right now your car stops rolling.
Yeah. Um...
I'm pinned. My seatbelt is jammed.
I can't breathe. I can't see anything. I can hear--
Oh god he's killing Bunting.
But the partner's not there yet?
No.
Where is he?
He's running towards us.
What's he wearing?
Jeans. Boots.
What's wrong with you? You killed a cop?
He's freaked out that Bunting's dead.
Why would he care?
I don't know. But he won't let him kill me.
Give me the gun.
She's a fed.
She knows that there's two of us now.
And he keeps telling him to...
Put pressure on it.
On the bleeding.
Ok. It's gonna be ok.
Wait. He was talking to me.
There's a lot of blood. Put pressure on it.
You're gonna be all right. Understand?
He knew we were on that road.
He was upset that Bunting was dead.
He wouldn't let Schrader kill me.
He kept telling me to put pressure on it.
And he was calm like he's done this before.
He was helping me.
He took Dan Otey's family upstairs
protected them from Schrader.
Do we really think a good guy hooked up
with a criminal like Dale Schrader?
You have one saved message.
3:37 AM
Joe honey it's me.
They got us. All of us.
I don't know where we are.
God I am so sorry.
Help us daddy!
Just do what he says ok?
Please just do whatever he says.
Joe help us.
Joe honey it's me.
He got us.
You've almost got it.
You're doing so good.
I'm sorry. Please.
Oh my god.
My god please stop!
Don't you touch him!
It's not his fault. I told him to do it.
No wait! What are you doing?
Mom! Mommy!
No! Don't take my kid!
Mom! Mommy! Mom help!
Stop!
Mom!
No...
Mom!
So how did Schrader get this guy to sign on?
6:30 AM
Good people do bad things.
I'm just saying it happens.
Right. But this partner wouldn't let me die.
He protected Otey's family.
In the same day he helped a convicted felon escape custody.
His loyalties are all over the place.
The guy sounds desperate.
Maybe he needs some money.
I mean Schrader's got a lot of it still out there.
He could have promised him a cut.
Ah I don't know. He's an accomplice
to 3 murders and a kidnapping.
Is there enough money out there
for you to sign on to something like that?
So it's something bigger than the money.
Um maybe Schrader's threatening him.
Leverage?
It would have to be big.
We caught Schrader because he kidnapped his daughter.
He was emotional and his guard was down.
Clearly family means more to him than we thought.
Schrader's ex-wife forced him to give up custody of Jenny.
Maybe he wants this guy to know what it feels like
to lose his family too.
It sounds like revenge to me.
Maybe it is.
You know what I just don't get?
Why people think you're a hero.
I know something they don't.
You want to be just like me.
Honest men bore you.
They're too predictable.
And you'd rather die than be ordinary
so you take risks and you push the limits.
But you were raised to be a good guy.
It's in your blood. You can't help it.
But that kills you a little bit.
That's why you had to figure out a way
for a good guy to be bad
and that's how you got into my world.
Am I close?
I want to talk to them.
You got your message and that picture.
How do I know you haven't killed them already?
You have to trust me.
Well I'm disappointed.
But your wife and your kids are gonna be devastated.
'Cause they didn't have to die.
Look you're gonna kill me. There's no point in hurting them.
What kind of father are you?
We've been over this.
I'm the only one who knows where they are.
As long as I'm alive they're safe.
If you stop helping me they're dead. How's that?
8:17 AM
Anything on Schrader's case?
The usual suspects-- judge lawyers.
They're all accounted for this morning.
If it's revenge then it's gotta be someone who put him away.
Well it's not the officers who arrested him
or the judge who sentenced him.
Then who is it?
Garcia I need the names of every law enforcement agent
involved in the Schrader case.
You know everybody.
Yeah but I want every single employee the year that he was arrested.
Ok give me a minute.
a whole minute? Come on baby girl what
Are you losing your touch?
Oh watch your pretty mouth.
Personnel records come at you now.
Who's still active?
most.
Would he risk using an active officer?
Depends on how much he hates them.
Has anyone retired?
Yeah two of them. Let's see--Matt Massey jeff Messick.
Both married with kids white in their 50s.
wait can I see those pictures?
No.
No.
Ohh. Why wouldn't he go after one of the officers
Who arrested him?
It makes the most sense for revenge.
Hey wait a minute guys. Listen to this.
There was a witness who never testified on Schrader's behalf.
Schrader could see that as a betrayal.
He gets out of prison and uses him to get what he wants.
Garcia i want you to run a history on a witness from the Schrader case
Joey Short.
Joey Short.
Was born in '66 in N.Y.C.
Didn't hold a lot of jobs except for construction.
In and out of rehab.
where is he now?
His last known address was 10 years ago.
Did he do time?
Mm-Mmm. No.
Come on Garcia. People don't just disappear.
This guy's got a history with a lot of holes in it.
He went to rehab.
You know maybe this guy had to walk the walk.
He was undercover.
That makes sense.
Those guys are up for anything
And they take big risks professionally and personally.
It explains his behavior too. Good guy doing bad things.
Garcia can you get us Joey short's real name?
It's not here.
Well if Schrader can find it so can we.
The guy needed to be Schrader's friend
So they're probably around the same age.
Look for academy graduates in the early nineties.
Ok.
Did any of them not go into police work?
Baby I don't follow you.
If he went undercover then anything tied to the academy
Would have to be severed. I mean the guy graduated
But he had to immediately start working his history as Joey Short.
He went into construction
Made his contacts in the bank robbery world
And then he met Schrader
Earned Schrader's trust
And then turned him in and got out of the game.
Ok. Here's a couple of guys look like they dropped out.
You got any pictures?
Sending them your way now.
That is the guy.
That picture is 10 years old but that's him.
That is joe muller.
He has a wife and 2 kids.
That's definitely the guy. Where is he now?
Betts.
Yes?
Joe Muller.
Let me look at you.
How's life?
It's a ride.
Molly the kids?
Good. They're good.
What are you doing here?
Just uh you know working on an old case.
Uh they stopped paying you didn't they?
Yes ma'am.
Don't you ma'am me. What do you need?
Just uh 5 minutes?
You got it.
You're the best.
Ok thanks.
Muller's not at home. No one is.
His wife didn't show up at work
The kids weren't at school yesterday or today.
Schrader probably has them hostage.
yeah but where?
What could joe muller do for him?
the only thing that's left. He can get him the money.
well no one even knows where it is.
schrader knows.
where do these guys hide money?
someplace safe.
would he be bold enough to hide it a safe deposit box?
a thief using a bank? Yeah maybe.
schrader can't walk into a bank.
His face is everywhere.
No one would think twice if muller walked in.
he'd have to have a key.
where's the physical evidence from the Schrader case?
We don't have it.
Well if we can figure out where Schrader hid the money
We'll know where he's going.
Hi.
Thank you.
We're with the FBI.
We're working the Dale Schrader case.
Is Joe Muller helping you?
No.
He was just here.
When?
2 minutes ago.
Thank you.
Where's my family?
2839 hillcrest drive.
Hillcrest? You got them downtown?
No that's where my money is.
Then what? This is never gonna end is it?
stop the car!
Put your hands where i can see them!
don't shoot. Schrader put it down!
put it down!
You really gonna let me blow his brains out?
Drop it or i'll shoot!
What's wrong agent? You still upset that I killed your buddy?
Did he have kids like this one?
Huh? Look at her. She's pissed.
Don't kill him.
Look at that look in her eyes.
She's gonna. She is gonna do it.
Come on what are you gonna do?!
Don't shoot. Don't do it Schrader.
How is your arm?
No! No!
Where are they? Where's my family?
Tell me where they are! Back up! Get away!
Help him!
Get away from him! Back off!
She just killed my family.
You just killed my family!
Calm down!
You just killed my family!
You killed my family!
Calm down!
The only person who knew where my family was
And now he's dead.
I had every chance to kill him.
But i couldn't. Because he had my family.
2 days. Somewhere.
And this photograph is the only proof of life?
Where's my phone?
Joe honey it's me.
He got us. All of us.
I don't know where we are.
God I am so sorry.
help us daddy!
Just do what he says ok?
Please just do whatever he says.
I'm gonna get Garcia to trace this.
Unknown name unknown number.
She might be able to help.
There was only one phone call?
I tried to get him to let me talk to them again
But he wouldn't.
There must not be anyone there watching them.
So he hid a family
where no one hears them call for help.
Someplace remote. That cabin?
No. The locals tore it apart.
There's no one there.
Where are they?
You saw Schrader since he's had your family.
You saw something or heard it.
There's got to be some clue.
When was the last time you saw your family?
Hold on Joe I've got to get my phone.
Oh uh it's right here.
Cold drains the battery.
I know. Sorry.
Ok.
See you later Mrs. Muller.
If you're lucky.
You notice any cars on the street?
Nothing.
Let me get your seatbelt in.
Our routine's the same every day.
The kids have to be at school by 8:15 then Molly heads to work.
She didn't make it to either yesterday. What was her route?
Uh north on route 7 east on 22.
Is that route isolated during the morning commute?
No.
If he was watching
there's a good chance she never left the driveway.
I drove out first.
Drive.
I just left them there.
Where did he find you?
At the hardware store.
I know who you are.
He told me how for 11 years
He'd been trying to figure out how he got locked up.
He knew Otey had ratted him out for the robbery
But that wasn't enough to put him away.
He said I was the piece that didn't fit.
He figured out I was a cop.
And he took your family.
Did you ever see this woman?
Yeah. I think she's some junkie.
I saw her right after he told me...
You help me your family lives.
You don't they die.
Pull over right up here.
Right here.
Stacy. I don't have time for this.
I told you there'll be more when it's over.
I got some people helping and they don't want to wait.
That's not my problem.
My brother said you were a son of a bitch.
You know what he's doing?
Huh? You know what's in here?
What's going on!
Open the door. - Who is she?
Go.
Come on. Drive.
Go!
You didn't know what she was talking about?
No.
Pull over.
What are you gonna do with her?
He could have left the body in the alley.
Why didn't he?
He didn't want to draw attention to that place.
Where was it?
Uh south of van wyck.
Bad area?
Abandoned. Junkies took over.
Perfect place to leave hostages.
Can you take us back there?
Wait. You think she knew about my family.
Her murder was the only thing that didn't fit
And now it makes sense. Schrader killed her to shut her up.
Rossi.
Turn around. Turn around!
FBI. Where are they?
Give me the stuff I'll tell you.
Where are the kids?
What kids?
Get him out of here. He don't know nothin' else.
We're going up. Come on rossi.
Clear!
Clear. Clear.
Molly?
The kids.
I'm so sorry.
Where are they?
I don't know.
Where are the kids?
I don't know. Find them.
All right. You're gonna be ok.
I got you.
Ok.
Clear!
Clear!
Rossi.
Hey little man.
Hey it's ok.
It's ok.
Go get Muller.
Your dad's looking for you.
We're gonna get you out of here.
It's gonna be ok all right?
We're getting your dad right now.
Are you ok?
Hey. Ok.
Ok.
How you doing? Can I pick you up?
Ok. Ok.
Come here sweetheart.
Oh I got you.
Washington Irving said
There is a sacredness in tears.
They are not the mark of weakness but of power.
They are messengers of overwhelming grief
and of unspeakable love.
You got a sec?
Come in.
I just wanted to say
That you exceeded all expectations leading this team.
Mine and everyone else's.
So have you Hotch.
You showed the skill and confidence of a natural leader
And...I thank you for it.
Of course.
I get why you're back.
Do you?
You were never going to sit behind a desk. You know why?
Because your son knows that you get the bad guys.
And if you're not out there trying to catch them
what's he going to think?
Well tonight he's gonna think I wasn't there at bedtime.
You're his hero Hotch.
I uh figured I'd save you a couple hours.
You don't have to do that anymore.
I know I don't.
But I also know what it's like to be raised by a single parent.
Every minute counts.
So if you need me to make that a regular thing
I'd be more than happy to.
I appreciate that.
I really do.
Good night.
