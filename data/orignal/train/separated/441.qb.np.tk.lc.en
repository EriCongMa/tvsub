and so , the white knight opened the door and saw
more gold and jewels than he could ever imagine .
the wizard said , &quot; give me the princess ,
and you shall have all the riches in the world . &quot;
the white knight gazed upon the wizard
and saw it was the devil ,
who had already banished the villagers &apos; wives .
&apos;i said , give me the princess&apos;
&apos;never , he cried , &apos;
and slayed the devil with his spear .
look after your sister .
no !
no !
no ! no !
no ! no !
no ! no ! help !
aah ! help me !
help !
no !
i don &apos;t know about this .
mike , will you stop being a wimp .
they say there &apos;s no escape .
the demons will always find you .
mike .
mike ?
holy crap .
oh , my gosh , i am so sorry for the delay .
the system was down . we overwork her .
and i had to go into the belly of the beast ,
who i affectionately nickname persephone ,
and do some machine whispering. thank you
which is good , because this one is a doozy .
emma baker .
38 , math teacher from medford , oregon .
she went missing 17 days ago ,
and her body was found yesterday afternoon
at st . baldwin &apos;s .
st. baldwin &apos;s is a now defunct psychiatric hospital
for the criminally insane . now , that is in salem , oregon ,
which is 230 miles away from medford ,
and we &apos;ve been called in for the bizarre nature of the case .
observe the photos .
wow . look at that dress .
was she going to a renaissance fair ?
not with her feet bound .
and missing persons report says that
she was in jeans and a t @-@ shirt .
but look at how she &apos;s laid out .
it &apos;s almost like it &apos;s a ceremony and she &apos;s the sacrifice .
there &apos;s obvious staging going on .
could it be a ritualistic killing ?
and cause of death is still unclear .
the m.e. report shows no sign of sexual assault
or mutilation except mangled and missing fingernails .
you know , there were rumors of satanic rites
being performed at byberry hospital in pennsylvania ,
which is also an abandoned asylum .
you know , judging by all the graffiti ,
this place isn &apos;t exactly locked down .
uh , yeah . the local p.d. said that
vandals and vagrants have been breaking in .
which means she could have been killed elsewhere
and placed here .
she had limestone under her fingernails , but limestone
wouldn &apos;t have been used when this asylum was built ,
so she was obviously held somewhere else .
well , the bottom line is , the unsub transported her
hundreds of miles from her hometown for a reason .
we just need to find out what that reason is .
wheels up in 30 .
please !
tell me what you want !
i &apos;ll do anything !
no , no .
let me out of here !
no ! aah ! no !
let me out of here !
we are each our own devil ,
and we make this world our own hell .
oscar wilde .
emma baker was a divorced math teacher . no children .
she has a boyfriend , though ,
who &apos;s a drummer in a goth band .
her facebook has pictures
of them at the bram stoker vampire festival .
and slayerama , which is a celebration of all things gothic .
hmm . teacher by day , elvira by night .
clearly this is a woman
with two different sides to her personality .
yeah , the boyfriend &apos;s band pours fake blood
all over themselves on stage .
ok , so if these two were satanists , it wouldn &apos;t be a stretch .
garcia , has the boyfriend been questioned by local p.d. ?
he has by phone . he &apos;s got an airtight alibi .
him and his band have been on tour to asia
for the last month .
well , if it &apos;s not the boyfriend ,
the unsub could be someone in their circle .
emily , you asked earlier if she was going to
a renaissance fair . there &apos;s something to that .
based on the dress , there could be more of a connection
to history than the occult .
renaissance fairs typically replicate 16th century england .
they &apos;ve surged in popularity since they began in the 1960s .
and it &apos;s not just a bunch of nerds in costumes
eating turkey legs , you guys .
a different time is somehow very important to this unsub .
agent hotchner ?
yes , sir .
detective gassner . thanks for coming out .
of course . this is agent rossi .
hi .
uh ... welcome to st . baldwin &apos;s .
creepy , isn &apos;t it ?
they shut it down in &apos; 98
after a fire burned down the east wing .
any idea what part of the hospital we &apos;re in now ?
this is the female ward .
the old day room to be exact .
hotch , take a look at this .
the victim was laid out here ,
but the bed wasn &apos;t here originally .
it was dragged across the floor from in there .
those are the old patient rooms .
these beds are heavy . this unsub went to a lot of trouble
to make sure that the victim was placed
right here in the middle of the room .
that is significant .
the unsub knows this place .
could be a former patient .
i &apos;ll have garcia pull up a list .
we , uh , photographed all the walls ,
and we &apos;re running a paint analysis
to find the most recent graffiti .
maybe a tagger saw something ...
or the unsub left his mark .
my son .
you &apos;ve been so brave .
i have no fear .
you will .
the wives will be stronger .
it &apos;s an honor to be chosen defender .
an honor and a curse for this family .
regardless , it is our sacred duty .
be vigilant .
never let your guard down .
send a warning .
show them our strength .
be ruthless and destroy them
before they destroy us .
i will .
i promise .
the cause of death was nicotine poisoning .
was it something in the white @-@ face makeup ?
no . no , the makeup &apos;s harmless .
and it was applied postmortem .
but the gown that she was wearing
was soaked in a nicotine @-@ based pesticide ,
so it was absorbed through her skin .
was that a quick death ?
at high doses , people can die immediately ,
but based on the levels in her bloodstream ,
she probably died in about an hour .
within minutes she was probably sweating
and then experiencing shortness of breath
and possibly seizures .
so she didn &apos;t have the wherewithal to remove the dress .
well , even if she did , she couldn &apos;t .
that corset was laced so tightly ,
it left lividity marks on her chest .
plus , someone sewed the dress shut over the closure .
i &apos;m guessing she wasn &apos;t sewn in by choice .
take look over here .
is that more nicotine bruising ?
well , you &apos;d think so .
but the clothing wasn &apos;t tight on her skin here .
see , the epidermis is thickened
and has signs of abscess formations .
she was submerged in water for some time
before she was killed .
so we were right .
he held her and tortured her first .
the question is , why ?
the unsub &apos;s not the first to do this .
poisoned garments actually have an incredibly long history ,
going all the way back to
the shirt of nessus ,
which killed hercules .
ok , so , i double @-@ checked ,
and this fabric is not manufactured for commercial sale .
is it possibly something from the past
that was maybe discontinued ?
no . i can tell you one thing , though .
the fabric is a double @-@ layer brocade .
it was probably custom @-@ made for someone ,
and it &apos;s very pricy .
ok , now what about the dress ?
did anything stand out ?
well , it &apos;s homemade , for one .
ok , how do you know that ?
well , the seams are uneven .
whoever the seamstress is , she isn &apos;t very skilled .
what makes you so sure it &apos;s a woman ?
well , there &apos;s some detail work in here
that would require small hands .
oh , and this is interesting . see , now , the stitching on this hem ,
it &apos;s narrow in some places and wider in others .
small hands , easily distracted .
let me ask you this . how old do you think someone could be
and still effectively sew this ?
well ... a pattern of this complexity ,
they &apos;d have to be a teenager .
ok , thanks .
based on the size of the victim &apos;s body ,
i think only an adult male would be able to lift her
and move a hospital bed , so ...
what , are we looking at a team here ?
or an unsub with a young accomplice who &apos;s being coerced .
i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d want breakfast or lunch ,
so i made both .
french toast and spaghetti .
you &apos;re spoiling me .
you saw mother again .
yes .
james , when can i go back to school ?
now i see why i &apos;m getting the royal treatment .
if i fall too far behind , i &apos;ll never catch up .
lara ...
i promise i &apos;ll be careful .
you can drop me off and pick me up .
look , we &apos;re different from other people .
i never should have put you out in the world
to subject you to ridicule .
ridicule ?
your birth defect is the first thing that people see .
and people can be so cruel .
but they &apos;re not .
i have friends at school , james . good friends .
then there &apos;s pity .
pity is worse than ridicule .
these people think that they &apos;re doing you a favor
by being nice to you , but they have no idea
how special you truly are .
if you let me go , i &apos;ll call you between every class .
i said no .
well , at least let me have a computer .
not in this house .
how many times do i have to say it ?
look , if you need to use a computer ,
i can take you to the library , ok ?
but you know that this is , this is for your own protection .
right ? you know that .
maybe mother &apos;s wrong .
don &apos;t you ever say that .
mother &apos;s plagued with visions that she &apos;d rather not see ,
but for our sake , i &apos;m glad she does .
you &apos;re hurting me .
is that the next wife ?
yes .
when will you hunt her down ?
when we &apos;re finished with the one that we have now .
fount of wisdom .
penelope , how many patients
were in the female ward of the asylum ?
uh , 32 . 6 died in the fire
that broke out in the kitchen next to the ward .
the rest were transferred out
of the facility when the hospital shut down .
anyone recently released ?
the last female patient that got out
was 5 years ago when she was 80 .
it was a compassionate release .
thanks , garcia .
hey , guys .
what do you think about this ?
batty . that &apos;s kind of on the nose .
no , not that . rick ,
can you zoom in right here ?
emma &apos;s the name of the victim .
it could also be completely unrelated to the case .
what do the numbers mean ?
my guess--patient i.d.s.
has the paint analysis come back yet ?
uh , this particular sample
was written no more than a week ago .
check these names against
missing women in oregon .
well , if this is a list of victims ,
it means there are more he hasn &apos;t chosen yet .
is she ...
she &apos;s one of them .
an innocent will die before the wise ,
but a devil &apos;s wife will surely rise .
alice pritchard was 22 .
a senior at portland college .
she went missing from campus 5 days ago .
a realtor found her body here this morning .
i don &apos;t see any physical similarities
to our first victim .
she &apos;s a lot smaller than emma .
different coloring , different age .
so these women aren &apos;t surrogates for anyone .
but he did lay her out in the same way .
she &apos;s displayed in the center of the room
just like the other victim at the asylum .
it &apos;s as if she &apos;s being presented .
there is so much attention paid to detail .
this is also satisfying some internal desire of the unsub .
so , why leave bodies in an empty storefront
and the asylum ?
good question .
there should be a connection between the two .
or maybe it &apos;s not about this storefront at all .
a theater company performing shakespeare .
the dress , the white makeup .
this victim could literally be wearing a costume .
what if this was the closest to the theater
that the unsub could get ...
without being caught ?
alice &apos;s sorority sisters say
she wanted to be a nurse
and she was active in a christian youth group .
if she was into anything dark ,
her best friends sure didn &apos;t know about it .
she was in portland collecting donations for an orphanage
when she disappeared .
the unsub could have approached her on the street .
hey , baby girl , you &apos;re on speaker .
give me the lowdown .
chocolate thunder , you can have the whole kit and caboodle .
just say the word .
oh , and i cross @-@ referenced the names you found on the wall
with missing women in oregon and i came up with some matches .
christine torres .
she is a 40 @-@ year @-@ old homemaker from eugene , oregon .
she went missing over a month ago
after she dropped her kids off at school .
any other women named emma missing ?
uh @-@ uh . just the one whose body we found .
same thing with alice .
hey , garcia , what was the exact date
christine was reported missing ?
february 28th . emma went missing on march 19th ,
alice on the 22nd .
guys , i think these numbers are dates .
if you reverse them and
chop off the 11 at the beginning and end ...
that &apos;s two days after each woman went missing .
it &apos;s more than that , though . look .
march first is saint eichatadt day .
march 21st is the spring equinox ,
and the 24th is the feast of the beast .
all important holidays in the satanic calendar for sacrifices .
what about the 11 on the end ?
to many occultists 11 is symbolic of lucifer .
ok , i thought we were moving away from the satanic killings .
apparently we need to reconsider .
there &apos;s gotta be some sort of connection to the devil here .
reid , what other upcoming dates
are significant to satanists ?
good friday , then easter eve .
then preparations begin in mid @-@ april
for the most important
holiday of all--walpurgis night on april 30th .
good friday &apos;s in two days .
that means he &apos;s hunting for his next victim today .
we need to give the profile soon .
hi !
hi yourself .
how are you feeling ?
better . thanks for asking .
are you contagious ?
gosh , no , not at all .
cool .
so , remember how you sponsored me
for the spring walk @-@ a @-@ thon ,
$ 5.00 a mile .
you owe me 50 bucks .
oh , right . let me get it .
is everyone still going saturday ?
i know you like henry , but you can forget about him ,
because he &apos;s taking stacy to the prom .
really ?
yeah .
is this your mom ?
i thought you were sleeping .
this is my friend chloe from school .
this is my brother james .
hi . it &apos;s nice to meet you . i &apos;ve heard so much about--
it &apos;s time for you to go .
james
but i was hoping that lara could come out on saturday
because that &apos;s when the prom is--
why did you do that ?
did you invite her ?
no , she came on her own .
she &apos;s not your friend .
yes , she is . she wanted to see how i was doing .
if i was still going to prom on saturday .
i don &apos;t have a date or anything .
a bunch of us are going as a group .
so can i go ?
absolutely not .
i only get one prom in my life ,
and you &apos;re gonna deprive me of it ?
please ?
i love you , james .
you &apos;re the best brother in the whole world .
your love is a mere shadow compared to mine .
and i would die for you .
is that what you want ?
no .
then don &apos;t invite unnecessary danger ?
i can &apos;t stay in this prison forever .
you speak like a green girl ,
unsifted in such perilous circumstances .
all right , let &apos;s do it again .
it &apos;s right this way .
the gowns in the photos look familiar .
let &apos;s see here .
oh , here .
from &quot; the merry wives of windsor . &quot;
this fabric is the same .
oh , and here &apos;s the other one from the same play .
they &apos;re practically identical .
are any costumes missing ?
oh , no . i just did an inventory on nonday ,
and we don &apos;t have duplicates of these gowns .
when was the last time the theater performed
&quot; the merry wives of windsor &quot; ?
well , let &apos;s see here .
oh , last fall .
and they haven &apos;t been used for anything else
or it would be marked on the label .
maybe somebody in the audience saw it
and made copies of the gowns .
but the level of detail suggests someone up close and personal .
we &apos;ll need a list of everyone involved in the production .
lara is beginning to question our mission .
i can &apos;t control her anymore .
she &apos;s 16 , which means she &apos;s at a vulnerable stage .
the devil will take notice of her now .
what do i do ?
my poor noble james .
you &apos;ll have to strike first
if you want to save those you love .
based on the dresses and makeup the victims were found in ,
we &apos;re looking for an unsub
who is living in an elaborate fantasy world .
he believes he is special , perhaps acting on behalf of the devil .
this unsub tortured his victims
by submerging them in water for days
before killing them .
which means he &apos;s deliberate and patient .
this guy has a vivid imagination .
the costumes and makeup suggest that he &apos;s a history buff ,
or he may be a fan of shakespeare .
using nicotine as a poison is highly unusual ,
so he &apos;s either very well @-@ read
or under the guidance of another .
his interests and delusions
have caused him to become isolated socially .
he can appear normal to his potential targets ,
and his crimes are not driven by sex or greed ,
but instead by his delusional belief system .
although the bodies of only two victims have been recovered ,
there &apos;s likely a third , specifically christine torres ,
who disappeared in february .
this unsub &apos;s exact age is difficult to determine ,
but he &apos;s probably in his 20s to 30s .
the fact that he travels so far to abduct his victims
indicates that he has a very specific selection criteria .
this unsub has a female or underage accomplice
to sew the dresses the victims were found in ,
but she may not be a partner in the traditional sense .
it &apos;s quite possible she was coerced into helping
and may actually be a victim herself .
most importantly , this unsub
is working according to a specific timetable
that corresponds with the satanic calendar ,
and he has plans to kidnap
another victim before the end of today .
thank you .
ok . thanks .
so , garcia checked out everyone associated with that theater production
of &quot; the merry wives of windsor . &quot; they &apos;re all in the clear .
well , the gowns have to be connected to the theater somehow .
it can &apos;t just be a coincidence .
there &apos;s something else that &apos;s been bothering me .
why is he putting white face makeup
on his victims after they &apos;re dead ?
isn &apos;t that what they wore in the elizabethan era ?
yes , but only upper @-@ class women wore white face makeup .
it was a symbol of virginity and purity .
but he &apos;s dressing them like
characters out of &quot; the merry wives of windsor , &quot;
which is one of shakespeare &apos;s rare plays about the middle class .
so it &apos;s inconsistent .
the makeup could mean that he believes death is purifying them .
what if this is like the salem witch trials ,
where they test the girls by trying to drown them ?
if they died , it meant they were obviously innocent .
if they somehow survived ,
they were considered witches and therefore hanged .
wonderful . a lose @-@ lose situation .
but the unsub didn &apos;t
submerge the victims in water to torture them .
it was some sort of a test ?
with death being the only possible outcome .
if he believes he &apos;s killing witches ,
he probably thinks that he &apos;s a vigilante
or a protector against evil of some sort .
laying the victims out the way
he did could be a message to the devil .
a symbol of victory and a warning ,
like putting a head on a spike .
he &apos;s not worshiping the devil .
he &apos;s trying to fight him .
can i get a heineken ?
only the finest wine should pass your lips .
so what is that , your best line ?
i &apos;ve been watching you for the last hour .
and you are the most ravishing creature
that i have ever seen .
the missing woman is sarah gammon ,
27 @-@ year @-@ old graphic artist .
her father drove to her apartment this morning
to pick her up for their weekly breakfast together .
she wasn &apos;t there .
where was she last seen ?
at a night club in portland , the , uh , mirage room .
she went with a girlfriend who had to leave early .
morgan and i will check it out .
ok , i did some varsity @-@ level sleuthing ,
and it turns out the costumes were donated
to the theater by a young actress named cate harris .
she was in their production
of &quot; the merry wives of windsor &quot; 16 years ago ,
which was the only other time that play was produced there .
where is she now ?
oh , i was hoping you would ask , because i have the answer .
she died in 1998 in the fire at st . baldwin &apos;s psychiatric hospital .
was she a patient there ?
oh , most definitely . and some say that she set that fire .
garcia , can you get her medical records ?
yeah , i tried to do that , but it turns out
the new director of st . baldwin &apos;s
was a technophobe hyper @-@ luddite like our dr . reid ,
and he only wanted the psych records to be on paper
to protect confidentiality .
ok . detective , we need you to get a copy of those records .
you got it .
what is this ?
your prom .
i didn &apos;t want you to miss it .
i spoke to mother again . she said that the end is near .
she did ?
you see , there &apos;s only ...
one more of the devil &apos;s brides left and we have her .
when she &apos;s dead , we &apos;ll be safe .
i can go to school again ?
the family will be free ,
and--and mother and i can finally--finally rest , so ...
i love this song .
i know .
i ... i remember .
dance with me .
so , did she like this guy that was hitting on her ?
oh , yeah . no offense to her ,
but she wouldn &apos;t normally get that sort of attention .
i mean , this was a handsome , rich dude .
he could have had his pick of the lot ,
but he was fixated on her .
how so ?
i saw him . a couple of knockouts tried talking to him ,
but he blew them off .
here , take a look .
she &apos;s the blonde .
and that &apos;s him .
he &apos;s following her .
how long before he talked to her ?
i think it was about an hour .
excuse me .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
well , there &apos;s no doubt she &apos;s the one he wanted .
i agree . his choice wasn &apos;t random .
it &apos;s like he knew she was gonna be there
and he went there looking for her .
but why these particular women ? they have nothing in common .
what if each victim has to look a certain way ?
he &apos;d want to find a real @-@ life match ,
and he &apos;d be willing to travel to get to her .
why isn &apos;t she moving ?
is she dead ?
no . no , no , no .
she can &apos;t be .
oh , my god , she was innocent .
you killed an innocent woman .
it &apos;s a trick .
she &apos;s dead , james .
you were wrong .
i &apos;m calling the police .
no ! no !
i &apos;m sorry .
ok ?
i &apos;m sorry , but we have to find the last of the devil &apos;s wives .
there &apos;s never gonna be a last one , is there ?
this &apos;ll go on forever and ever .
apparently the state would have to pay for a new storage facility
if they moved the records .
someone decided , why bother if the old place works ?
ladies .
no electricity , i take it .
you would be correct .
hey . i think i found it .
yeah . oh . first of all ,
cate harris was a stage name for catherine heathridge ,
a textile heiress .
her family kept the pseudonym
for her medical admission to protect their privacy .
according to the intake report ,
catherine was an aspiring actress
who went off her psychiatric medications
when she was pregnant with her daughter .
she had a minor part in &quot; the merry wives of windsor &quot; 16 years ago
when she became floridly psychotic .
she was convinced the other actresses were the devil &apos;s wives ,
so she stabbed one of them .
is that when she was admitted here ?
not yet . it seems she had a son and a daughter .
after fleeing the theater ,
she chopped off the left arm of her infant daughter .
why would she do that ?
to make the child less appealing to the devil .
she believed that killing
the devil &apos;s wives was her mission on earth ,
which is what our unsub is doing now .
but she died in the asylum fire .
someone else must be carrying out her mission .
i murdered an innocent .
even white knights have their dark days .
you &apos;re a vanishing breed , james .
my son , a hero from a different time .
only one wife remains . i &apos;m sure of it .
if you don &apos;t kill her , who will ?
no one .
kill her .
kill her .
if someone &apos;s carrying on in catherine &apos;s mission ,
then it &apos;s quite possible they both suffer from folie a deux ,
a shared psychotic disorder
between two people who are extremely close ,
and that would mean it &apos;s most likely a family member .
maybe one or both of her kids .
garcia , i need you to find everything you can
on the heathridge family ,
specifically catherine &apos;s son and daughter .
ok , finding it as we speak .
bingo . catherine , a wealthy textile heiress ,
had a son james , now 26,
and a daughter lara , now 16 .
father died in a speedboat accident right before lara was born .
they were raised by their grandfather
in a mansion outside portland after mom was committed .
is the grandfather still alive ?
no . he died last year .
that could have been the stressor .
garcia , where are the kids living now ?
james was kicked out of a seminary in colorado 3 years ago ,
but that &apos;s still listed as his address .
lara dropped out of school 6 weeks ago ,
coincidentally on her birthday .
and the family home is her listed address ,
and i &apos;m sending you pictures right ... now .
that could be him .
the man at the night club who left with sarah gammon .
all right , contact the seminary .
garcia , i &apos;m gonna need an address .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i swear i &apos;m not one of them . please don &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m going to save you .
i &apos;ll die , james . you know i will .
not if i murder the devil first . let &apos;s go .
he &apos;ll see you
and he &apos;ll come for you .
and when he does , i &apos;ll strike .
what if you fail ?
then we &apos;ll die together .
morgan , you and jj take the back . we &apos;ll take the front .
did you see that ? there &apos;s a girl up in that window .
you check it out . i &apos;ll look for james .
damn .
it looks like we just found our first victim .
ok .
ok .
ok , i &apos;m gonna get this off you , ok ? hold on .
ok . ok .
where is james ?
&quot; all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream . &quot;
edgar allan poe .
so , lara is gonna be ok . she confirmed that
the bodies were left out as messages to the devil .
well , her brother &apos;s dead . what happens to her now ?
there &apos;s always foster care .
for an heiress ? i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m sure guardians and
trustees will be coming out of the woodwork .
so she &apos;ll end up back here ,
in a house that breeds delusions .
hopefully not .
i &apos;ll get it .
i &apos;ve waited so long for you , lara .
