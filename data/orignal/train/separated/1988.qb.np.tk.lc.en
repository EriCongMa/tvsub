hey , mike , it &apos;s rachel .
i know i shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
i know you &apos;re seeing jenny ,
but i can &apos;t stop thinking about the kiss ,
and i can &apos;t go back .
morning , jessica .
ms. pearson .
hey , i just wanna thank you so much
for keeping me on despite the--
i guess , i just want to let you know
that i &apos;m gonna work hard ,
and i &apos;m gonna-- you know , i &apos;m gonna make you proud .
not-- not like a son- you know--
i mean , we don &apos;t really look that much alike , i guess .
that &apos;s a-- that &apos;s a strange thing to say .
uh , i just-- what i meant is that i really appreciate
everything that you- okay .
hardman ?
one would assume .
did he ask you ?
no , he did not .
he needs your signature .
and yet there was a wall here yesterday .
well , at least he didn &apos;t ask for his office back .
i wouldn &apos;t have given it back .
i wouldn &apos;t have given yours back to you .
unless you asked really nicely .
isn &apos;t that--
mine .
shot across the bow .
no , an act of war .
i love the smell of napalm in the morning .
it &apos;s not taupe .
the color , the walls .
hardman asked for taupe .
i mean , it might be tan ,
or beige with a hint of mauve .
but it definitely isn &apos;t taupe ,
and don &apos;t try to tell me that it is .
hey , louis , what color shades
would go well with these taupe walls ?
enough .
i didn &apos;t even say anything .
did you want something ?
yes , chain of command is everything to me .
if i don &apos;t know who to answer to ,
i might as well be living naked on a kibbutz
in the middle of africa .
an option worth considering , though we &apos;d miss you .
not really .
your point ?
who do i work for ?
i assume i work for you ,
but hardman just asked me to personally summarize
every case at this firm .
and i was hoping maybe that you can
let him know that i answer to you .
you do answer to me , louis .
and daniel and i are on the same page on this .
you &apos;re the right man for the job .
well , thank you , that &apos;s all i needed to hear .
why &apos;d you lie ?
because you don &apos;t let the children know
that mommy and daddy are fighting .
uh , rachel .
i &apos;m busy .
oh , okay . how &apos;s it going ?
busy , so if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;m just gonna--
i need to talk to you for a second , okay ?
okay .
so-
zane , i need you .
in my office . now .
you were saying ?
i just , um--
what part of &quot; now &quot; wasn &apos;t clear ?
by the time i &apos;m in my chair .
i should probably go .
no , i--
i got your message .
yes !
we &apos;re taking the offensive .
good , give me a gun and tell me where to point it .
hardman has designs on my job .
he &apos;s gonna need a power base .
i need to make sure every department is happy .
i can &apos;t do that alone .
well , that &apos;s where i come in .
everybody loves me .
not real estate .
there was a thing once ...
with a guy .
with a couple of guys .
but anywhere else--
no , contracts thinks you &apos;re a dick .
their word , not mine .
why don &apos;t you join us ?
oh , thanks . love to .
taxes ?
oh ... no .
mergers ?
hate him .
but i-
didn &apos;t work .
really ?
i am tied in , harvey .
there are a lot of underbelly things that i can tell you ,
but trust me , this is not one of them .
even norma knows .
what ?
people just don &apos;t like that he &apos;s right all the time .
you think i like it ?
what &apos;s his standing in bankruptcy ?
excellent . i think .
we don &apos;t do a lot of work with bankruptcy .
remind me to fire you .
remind me to give you a raise .
bankruptcy .
i need you to court paul porter .
you don &apos;t have some hot coals i could walk across instead ?
i don &apos;t like him either .
he &apos;s always been dubious of me .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s because
i &apos;m a woman or black or maybe
he just doesn &apos;t like--
your overbearing nature ?
your holier @-@ than @-@ thou attitude ?
this is not a joke , harvey .
how this is gonna go down is he &apos;s--
i know , he &apos;s gonna worm his way in ,
and then one day , call for a vote .
and when that day comes , every vote will count .
even paul &apos;s .
hardman is awesome .
i mean , he , um , brought in this omelet bar for the associates ,
but it &apos;s no ... big deal .
really good .
this pineapple was growing on a plantation on lanai yesterday .
do not trust it .
don &apos;t trust the pineapple ?
hardman .
would you-- come on .
i don &apos;t want it .
are you serious ?
you &apos;re afraid of the pineapple ?
i know it &apos;s got a rough exterior ,
but it &apos;s all sweet on the inside , i promise .
&quot; come on . i love you , harvey . &quot;
it &apos;ll be good for you .
see ?
it &apos;s spectacular .
but this doesn &apos;t change the fact
that this is what he does .
he &apos;s coming back and people are gonna have to choose sides .
can i choose his side ?
sure .
support a man you never met over a partner
who knows you never went to harvard ,
knows you &apos;re not really a lawyer and is keeping you on anyway .
jessica it is .
ready to serve .
i need you on paul porter .
the bowtie guy ?
every case he has--
read , summarize , find weaknesses .
i want to know everything he knows .
what , is he getting fired ?
nope .
he &apos;s getting lunch .
so , hardman &apos;s back .
it &apos;s interesting stuff , huh ?
lots to talk about .
do you have a question , louis ?
yes .
i mean , you know jessica .
that &apos;s not a question .
she seems bothered .
huh.still not a question .
hardman was managing partner , now she &apos;s managing partner .
do you even know what a question is ?
donna ... look . i need information .
now i wanna know what the whole story is
so i can formulate some sort of strategy .
you mean formulate whose ass to kiss ?
i have two house seats to the stage reading of a new albee play .
edward albee ?
yes .
meryl streep ...
and glenn close .
no !
we can go .
no . no .
i cannot tell you what i do not know , louis .
okay .
well , you know where they are .
curtain &apos;s at 8 : 00 .
hi .
wait a minute , i kiss you like that
and all you have to say to me is &quot; hi &quot; ?
come on , admit it .
i kind of rocked your world .
look , mike , it was a good kiss , but ...
jenny ?
we broke up .
it turns out i kind of have feelings for this other girl .
so ... it &apos;s over ?
well , um , in that case ,
then , yes , it was a good kiss .
but just so we &apos;re clear , i rocked your world .
you did .
now tell me what would you say ...
to helping me with my work in a professional capacity ?
smooth .
actually , you know what , you could .
i have to summarize all those cases in bankruptcy .
it &apos;s funny because i have to summarize
all of the cases at the firm .
for hardman .
so you don &apos;t like him .
i don &apos;t .
you wanna tell me why over dinner ?
are you asking me out ...
on a date ?
yeah , i am .
to talk about hardman ?
hardman who ?
no , i wanna talk about our kiss .
and when i say , &quot; talk about , &quot; i mean repeat .
and when i say , &quot; kiss , &quot; i mean--
redacting all those phone calls
in the slessinger filing .
getting better .
quick study .
a date it is .
and by &quot; date &quot; i mean--
okay , no more of this .
yeah , of course .
so this is what it &apos;s like , huh ?
this is what what &apos;s like ?
being closed by harvey specter .
i don &apos;t resent it .
it &apos;s a great meal , great table .
but let &apos;s not pretend it &apos;s not self @-@ serving .
hardman is back .
jessica doesn &apos;t want to go back to the kitchen .
jessica pearson was never the &quot; housewife . &quot;
you know where my office is , harvey ?
46 .
i &apos;ve been knocked down three floors in five years
on jessica &apos;s watch .
we have to look into that .
i don &apos;t want a new office .
i want respect .
what you want is for someone
to help you with madison 25 .
you &apos;ve done your homework .
you are about to lose a huge client , paul .
i don &apos;t want to close you .
let me close him .
the problem is tom klapperich . he &apos;s like you .
he thinks he knows better than everyone .
truth is he doesn &apos;t know his ass from a hole in the ground .
he needs to declare bankruptcy
and he doesn &apos;t wanna hear that .
well , let me keep him in the family
in exchange for backing jessica .
well , you close him , then we &apos;ll talk .
that &apos;s not so reassuring .
you came to me .
i didn &apos;t come to you .
i &apos;ll see you on the first tee .
no , you won &apos;t .
oh , is this where you make your threat ?
i &apos;ve had the carrot , now i get the stick ?
that &apos;s not my style .
the person you &apos;re gonna meet on the tee is fred couples .
and just so we &apos;re clear ,
that &apos;s being closed by harvey specter .
let &apos;s talk football .
peyton manning goes down ,
you lose your first 13 games .
you gotta protect your assets and build for the future .
you don &apos;t wanna pay 28 million for a guy
who may not play next year .
so what do you do ?
you move on .
the season isn &apos;t over , harvey .
you &apos;re 200 million in the red
with 1 / 4 billion due in two days .
madison 25 is going to be built .
madison 25 should be built , but the market &apos;s changed .
vacancies are up , rents are down ,
and you can &apos;t take out a loan against your future
if the money &apos;s never gonna flow .
it &apos;s time to protect your franchise .
really ? i should just skate
while the hundreds of contractors and subcontractors
that i &apos;ve made financial commitments to ,
they should just wait in line with their hands held out ,
hoping for 50 cents on the dollar ?
they know how the business works .
look , i know that paul feels i should protect myself .
i should protect my family business ,
but i want to protect my family name .
there &apos;s no shame in declaring bankruptcy , okay ?
it &apos;s a tool that will allow you to survive .
wanna know the kind of guy i am , harvey ?
i &apos;m the kind of guy ,
that when the clock says , &quot; the game &apos;s over , take a knee , &quot;
that &apos;s when i throw a hail mary .
everybody throws a hail mary when they got nothing to lose .
you got something to lose .
i like long odds .
let &apos;s just say , i won &apos;t declare bankruptcy .
what are my other options ?
i have an idea .
you were right ...
about hardman and jessica .
you want something from me .
i do .
mike needs an extension on a $ 1 / 4 billion loan .
and you want me to believe that you &apos;re here for mike ?
yes .
harvey needs me .
i know you &apos;re amazing at dealing with banks , louis .
what , do you think i &apos;m gonna fall for that sh-- ?
i mean just , like , the best .
what bank ?
national metropolitan .
the gatekeeper ?
elaine cohen ?
exactly .
so , you think you can get him in ?
well , you know i can get him in .
but you also know i can keep him out .
okay , what &apos;s it gonna take ?
five details of the pearson hardman divide .
no .
three ?
no .
one ?
one .
and i get the albee tickets .
we get the albee tickets .
tell a soul , deal &apos;s off .
done .
i love tom .
i love madison 25 , really .
but i &apos;m afraid if you look at the fine print ,
the terms of the loan are what they are ,
and what they aren &apos;t
is subject to renegotiation .
are you kidding me ?
the terms of loans are adjusted all the time .
and you can see he has the assets .
what i see ?
is that i &apos;m gonna have to give you a 50 % haircut on that .
that is not liquid .
you &apos;re never gonna be able to sell
a minority partnership interest , and that--
a monkey could tell you could never monetize that .
you know what else a monkey could tell you ?
you &apos;re about to ruin a property that will make you millions .
i &apos;m so sorry , gentlemen , but this is not 2007 .
we don &apos;t play that game anymore .
the days of you high @-@ flying people
claiming you &apos;re richer than god
when all you &apos;re really doing is
moving assets around are over .
today we &apos;re gonna take a look up your skirt
and see what you have .
and i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t have much .
she actually said that ?
yes .
please don &apos;t make me relive it .
as it is , i may drink a lot on our date .
you know , if we &apos;re really gonna do this ,
we should probably be careful talking about it here .
oh , you &apos;re right . yeah .
we should definitely set some dating ground rules .
you &apos;re not taking me home , to my place or yours .
whoa , okay , i &apos;m not talking about ground rules for sex .
i &apos;m talking about ground rules for keeping this thing quiet .
oh . so you think if we went to my place or yours ,
that means sex ?
uh , no . i mean--
you--
what i meant was that i know you didn &apos;t want to date anyone
in the office , and i assume you have a reason for that .
oh , okay , there is .
there &apos;s a story . i see it right there .
there &apos;s no story there . i dated someone here once .
it didn &apos;t work out . that &apos;s it .
no more questions . those are my ground rules .
note to self : touchy about dating history .
wow , i smell pheromones in the air .
which suggests to me , ms. zane , that you failed to grasp
the importance of the task that i assigned .
or unless you &apos;re done .
well , i--
no ?
you do realize you asked her
to summarize every case in the firm , right ?
i &apos;m so sorry , was i talking to you ?
because i already did your job for you .
actually , the bank didn &apos;t budge .
i got you in , michael .
what do you expect me to do everything ?
now , do i have to gather every first year
and make them stay the night because the paralegal
was too busy flirting and couldn &apos;t get it done ?
actually , all the associates are leaving early tonight .
excuse me ?
yeah , hardman invited everyone to his box at the garden .
springsteen .
the boss ?
wait , didn &apos;t he invite you ?
you think i want to spend my evening with a bunch of
douche bag associates at a concert
given by a goddamn octogenarian ?
get it done .
if i wanted to sink his business to keep his business ,
i could have done that myself .
hello , paul . make yourself at home .
you made him think he could risk , not just this project ,
but everything he owns , on a personal guarantee .
are you crazy ?
what i am , paul , is working my ass off to make your client happy .
you think i haven &apos;t tried everything
to keep his dream alive ?
the fact is , the bank is going to foreclose .
tom needs to be protected ,
and your plan is too big a risk .
for you , yes , but not for tom ,
and as i understand it , we work for him .
no , no , no , no .
i work for him .
you are working for me .
i said he needed to declare bankruptcy ,
but , oh , you @-@ you played it your way .
well , jessica may give you free rein to do that ,
but i can &apos;t imagine hardman will .
you know , paul , couples passed on a little tip for you .
he said your game was weak because you were too cautious .
i said , &quot; it &apos;s not your game , it &apos;s who you are . &quot;
harvey , i may have been knocked down to the 46th floor ,
but bankruptcy
is on the rise .
my influence in this firm is not nothing .
you get tom to sign those papers .
is that a threat ?
i don &apos;t make threats .
i just do what i do .
find anything ?
oh , i &apos;m gonna make paul love you .
that &apos;s doubtful . he got wind of our little maneuver .
what ?
you said &quot; got wind . &quot;
anyway , i have another maneuver .
a better one .
paul says we tell tom there &apos;s no other way .
but there is another way .
oh , wait , you don &apos;t even want to hear it ?
of course i want to hear it .
since when do i
take marching orders from a bow tie ?
there are eight projects being built
in the two blocks around madison 25 .
every one of them started after it .
madison 25 is the centerpiece of the whole development .
if it &apos;s not finished , they &apos;re all worthless .
that &apos;s not the bank &apos;s problem .
but it is , &apos; cause guess what six of these buildings
have in common .
national &apos;s backing them all ?
doesn &apos;t make sense for them to foreclose and devalue
all their other projects .
unless they have another agenda .
huh , i wonder where we could ever find evidence of that ?
think that helps us ?
i think we can take this to the bank .
now , you see , that &apos;s funny
because we &apos;re actually going to a bank .
that &apos;s good .
twice in one day , mr. specter .
i understand how your client must feel .
actually , he &apos;s feeling fantastic .
you know why that is ?
&apos;cause i told him the balloon payment &apos;s going away .
okay , i &apos;ll bite . why is it going away ?
because as much as people hate lawyers ,
you know who they hate more ?
bankers .
after all , you were the ones
that got us into this recession in the first place , right ?
oh , gentlemen . i do not need a history lesson .
then let &apos;s talk about the future .
what happens to madison 25
after you force it into bankruptcy ?
maybe someone steps in and finishes it .
someone whose recent merger leaves them
needing a large downtown address ?
oh , now that you mention it ,
there &apos;s a little item in your shareholder letter
about the search for a new corporate headquarters .
yeah , i like to read .
well , i don &apos;t--
you intend to leverage this foreclosure
to get a prime piece of real estate at a song .
you see , elaine , we looked up your skirt .
and the six clients you represent
surrounding madison 25 , well , it turns out
pearson hardman actually reps three of them .
and when the other three find out about what you &apos;ve done ,
which will happen right after i leave here ,
we &apos;ll rep all six .
and when we move their business elsewhere ,
they &apos;ll take roughly , mm--
a shit load of money out of your bank .
shit load ?
well , give or take .
it &apos;s important that nobody knows about this .
i &apos;ve never ...
done anything like this before .
louis , there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
exploring your options is something
everybody does these days .
sometimes you &apos;re in a relationship ,
they take you for granted .
you shouldn &apos;t be taken for granted .
i wouldn &apos;t take you for granted .
i &apos;ve never even considered this .
really ? people do it all the time .
well , not me .
i never even let myself think it , let alone--
sometimes , louis ,
the only way to move on
is try something new .
you &apos;re trying to seduce me .
i &apos;m merely saying ,
if jessica pearson can &apos;t see the quality of the work that you do ,
i know half a dozen firms who will .
litt , nothing , and nobody .
i mean , who does she think she is ?
so ... high and mighty .
the question isn &apos;t , &quot; can i get you an offer ? &quot;
it &apos;s , &quot; how good an offer can i get you ? &quot;
uh , solicitation ?
drugs and prostitution , that &apos;s what you think of me ?
i &apos;ve guessed everything else .
okay , what were you arrested for ?
uh , jaywalking ? murder ?
spill it .
nope , mm @-@ mm .
i will have to remain a mystery to you .
so , um--
it was a nice date . great restaurant .
well i actually picked it myself .
did you ?
i actually asked donna myself .
see , honesty , i @-@ i love that in a man .
look , i know that we joked about not
going home together--
i think you were right , so--
you know , if we &apos;re gonna do this , let &apos;s--
let &apos;s do it right .
okay .
yeah . let &apos;s do it right .
good night .
remind me to move .
no forwarding address . come to think of it ,
how did you get my address in the first place ?
that &apos;s a nice tux . where were you tonight ?
it &apos;s not where i was , it &apos;s where i &apos;m going .
you &apos;re going out now ?
oh , i know , it &apos;s already past your bedtime .
go .
so listen ,
everything became clear tonight , okay ?
i was out with rachel .
oh , gosh , here it comes .
days of our lives .
i &apos;m serious , okay ?
i need to--i need to talk to you about this .
i need to tell you something . listen--
i need to make sure that you understand that i--
look , i understand . i think we &apos;ve covered this .
i &apos;m not interested in your personal life .
i realize that because you don &apos;t have one .
oh , yeah , great , you &apos;re an international man of mystery ,
but i &apos;m not you , all right ?
i want a personal life .
and i don &apos;t want to be a liar , so ...
i &apos;m gonna tell rachel . everything .
no , you &apos;re not .
all these lies keep coming back to haunt me , harvey .
all right , i @-@ i can &apos;t do it .
i @-@ i can &apos;t live my life that way .
i wanted to tell you ,
now you know .
have fun in monte carlo .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
harvey , please--
after everything i did
to keep your job , you &apos;re just gonna start spreading it around
that you &apos;re a fraud ?
i &apos;m not spreading it around .
i &apos;m telling rachel . she &apos;s on our side .
no , she &apos;s not .
because when you do something stupid ,
which won &apos;t take very long , you don &apos;t know what she &apos;ll do .
harvey , i understand--
no , what you fail to understand
is our firm is under attack .
and if this gets to hardman , we &apos;re done .
you , me , and jessica .
you want to take down the firm , mike ?
so you can get laid ?
hey , maybe for you relationships are all about getting laid ,
but not for me .
i actually care about her .
weren &apos;t you just with that other girl last week ?
isn &apos;t that what led to jessica making me fire you in the first place ?
what are you saying ?
you &apos;re saying that i can &apos;t date rachel ?
date rachel ! or don &apos;t , i don &apos;t care .
but you &apos;re not gonna tell her .
i can &apos;t be in a relationship based on a lie .
then i guess you have your answer .
but being honest with her about this ?
that is off the table .
there is no &quot; about this . &quot;
i &apos;m either honest with her , or i &apos;m not .
you tell her , and you &apos;re done .
i really do need to move .
i &apos;m telling you , you better be here to tell me that i was--
jessica . come on in .
i just got a call from the bank .
and you ran right over to tell me i was awesome .
you are decidedly not awesome .
oh , i beg to differ .
i just strong @-@ armed one of the premier financial institutions in this country
into allowing our client to pursue his dreams .
that &apos;s almost patriotic .
did you really miss the point of what i asked you to do ,
or can you just not help being a dick ?
my word this time .
jessica--
your job was to make paul happy ,
not take over a case and do it your way .
the client &apos;s way .
no , it &apos;s the client &apos;s way
because you told the client it could be done .
and i was right !
and yet the experts , the people i pay to know bankruptcy
feel that paul &apos;s client--
oh , yes , harvey , paul &apos;s client--
stands to put more money at risk
when he can get out now and move on .
this is better . this is a win @-@ win .
no , it &apos;s lose @-@ lose , and i &apos;m not losing this one .
you are not to pitch this to the client .
i can &apos;t keep it from him .
you &apos;re not hearing me , harvey .
this isn &apos;t a discussion .
tell the client it didn &apos;t work .
you tried , you failed .
move on .
i &apos;m sorry if paul &apos;s ego is bruised--
this isn &apos;t about his ego . it &apos;s about yours .
make it go away ,
and then walk away .
i even told him about the time i got arrested .
it &apos;s crazy , it &apos;s like we can talk about anything .
that &apos;s , um @-@ that &apos;s great .
i can tell you &apos;re nervous . don &apos;t be .
we &apos;re gonna find a secret meeting spot
somewhere outside of the office .
no one here will have any idea what &apos;s going on .
watch this .
good morning , mr. ross .
eh ... uh , morning .
you still need some work on that .
harvey told me .
i know you work for him , but he &apos;s wrong about this .
if he really cared about me ,
he wouldn &apos;t be handing out ultimatums .
ow .
do you like this office ?
sure .
do you know how much harvey likes this office ?
harvey loves this office .
but for you , he was willing to give it up .
he &apos;s giving me his office ?
how do you think he kept your job , fraud man ?
hmm ? because harvey said it was a package deal .
she fired you , she fired him .
so before you go mouthing off about him not caring about you ,
you think about that .
wait a minute .
he did that for me ?
i just--
what--what am i supposed to say to her ?
i mean , rachel and i are both finally in the right place .
i told her that i wanted this , and now--
i &apos;m gonna look like such an asshole .
just do it gently .
firmly , but ...
gently .
and--and that &apos;s gonna help ?
no , probably not .
how are we even supposed to work together after that , huh ?
it &apos;s possible .
it is ?
it is .
and how do you get from here to--
the feelings just go away .
eventually .
can i help you , louis ?
jessica , listen , um ,
i know you &apos;ve got a lot going on right now ,
um , but i just wanted to tell you that i--
jessica . we need to talk .
excuse me . hi , i was--
now .
never mind , it can wait .
yes , paul ?
i want to make sure that you and i are on the same page .
i gave you and harvey an opportunity .
i didn &apos;t give you a client .
i am well aware of your position , paul .
if you &apos;ll excuse me ?
what ?
sorry .
put it right here .
and get out .
daniel hardman ?
the xjs 5000 dictaphone ?
how the hell did he know ?
i heard the bank came through .
jessica told me to tank the deal .
sucks , doesn &apos;t it ?
being told what to do .
what not to do .
what are you gonna do about what we talked about ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think you do know .
i think you know what &apos;s right ,
whether i had to tell you or not .
so , tom .
harvey has something to tell you .
did you find me my miracle ?
the bank agreed to alter the terms of the loan .
no balloon payment .
madison 25 is safe . no bankruptcy .
oh , oh , man . thank you .
thank you so much .
well , paul .
looks like you found me the right quarterback
for the fourth quarter .
i won &apos;t forget this .
no , nor will i.
i have been irritated by you , exasperated with you ,
and angry at you ,
but i never thought i &apos;d feel betrayed by you .
i put together a good deal .
it was a safe deal .
i don &apos;t care .
you just ensured that a voting partner would never back me .
if his mother were dying of cancer and i saved her ,
i still wouldn &apos;t get his vote .
i know you &apos;re angry ,
but i took the restructured deal to real estate .
that puts them in your pocket .
real estate has always been in my pocket .
it &apos;s only you they hated .
and i &apos;m beginning to understand why .
this isn &apos;t me against you .
hardman is back .
you were the one person i could trust .
jessica
i &apos;ve always known
what you are , harvey ,
and i thought that was my greatest asset .
now i &apos;m wondering if you &apos;re not my biggest liability .
this isn &apos;t about bankruptcy .
you &apos;re still pissed off about mike ross .
damn right i am .
i offered to walk away .
that offer was bullshit , and you know it .
you hired that kid to amuse yourself ,
and now i &apos;m vulnerable .
and after everything that &apos;s happened ,
you still couldn &apos;t put me ahead of you .
the client asked me to save his dream .
i did .
you &apos;re actually starting to believe your own bullshit .
jessica , come on .
just go , harvey .
i will get past this . i will move on .
and i will accept that at the end of the day ,
that i am alone in this .
four blocks from the office ,
i sort of love this clandestine thing .
kind of sexy , right ?
oh , thank you .
look , i was thinking about what you said last night ,
and you &apos;re right , i have been so scared about
taking the lsats , i know i have .
rachel , i , uh--
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
we can &apos;t do this anymore .
okay .
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to--
wait , where &apos;s this coming from ?
because last night you--eh @-@ this was all your idea .
i know .
so ?
collin mccarthy ?
what about collin mccarthy ?
you dated him .
yeah , i know .
he was a first @-@ year .
you broke up with him , and his work went off a cliff ,
and then he was fired two months later .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want to date someone from the office , right ?
this is ridiculous . he has nothing to do with you and me .
but he does .
i know that you and i both want this , okay , but--
chances are , i &apos;m gonna screw it up .
i love my job ,
and i love @-@ i love working with you .
and i &apos;m afraid , okay ? i &apos;m afraid that--
that this will ruin that .
so--
wow , that was a lot of words , mike .
why don &apos;t you just say it ?
you know what , actually , don &apos;t say it .
i can say it for you because it doesn &apos;t take me days
to hear your message .
i hear your message loud and clear .
i &apos;m just not good enough for you .
have norma send up a bouquet of flowers ,
and make sure that they repolish the cherrywood .
it &apos;s walnut .
i just wanted to make sure that the place was ready .
i had them redo the walls .
this is taupe .
i want it to be perfect
for when daniel gets back .
you wanted something this morning .
i &apos;m sorry , i was rushed .
i &apos;m not now .
do you still need me ?
no .
checking up on me ?
checking in on you .
well , don &apos;t worry , harvey .
you were right , as always .
i don &apos;t like having to tell you to do something
that you don &apos;t want to do .
why is it that i have to do everything that you tell me to ,
but you can ignore whatever jessica tells you to do ?
you have plenty of time to find the right girl , mike .
well , thank you .
guess i should get my book , take some notes .
harvey specter &apos;s dating tips .
&apos;cause i &apos;m sure you told yourself that at 25 and 30
and 35 , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be
telling yourself that when you &apos;re 50 .
you know i was right .
doesn &apos;t make it any better .
you &apos;re not alone in this .
put it over there .
you wanted to see me , mr. hardman ?
please , call me daniel .
what do you want me to do ?
put him in his place , hard .
let me be clear . you &apos;re number two .
i answer to number one .
when i said put him in his place ,
i didn &apos;t mean have him show up in court .
you two were playing each other
and you &apos;re using me to do it .
no matter who you answer to ,
