hi !
hey !
so , what &apos;s the final head count on my baby shower ?
about twenty . couple people from work had something else to do .
your sisters called and can &apos;t make it .
what ? you mean they &apos;re not coming to a social event ..
where there &apos;s no men and no booze ? that &apos;s shocking .
i don &apos;t care , as long as my mom &apos;s here .
oh , my god . your mother .
what ? my mom &apos;s not gonna be here ?
well , given that we forgot to invite her , it would be a big coincidence if she was .
my god !
phoebe was in charge of the invitations .
i don &apos;t have a mother . so often i forget ..
oh , give it a rest .
so my mother is not coming to my baby shower ?
no .
neither is mine .
we &apos;ll take care of it . we &apos;ll call her . you go home and get ready .
make sure she comes . it &apos;s important . it &apos;s my mom .
i know . what &apos;s her number ?
i don &apos;t know .
go . i have it in my book . go .
if you &apos;re in charge of invitations , why am i calling her ?
hello , mrs. green ! hi , it &apos;s monica geller .
oh , hello , monica .
hi .
it &apos;s last @-@ minute , but we &apos;ve decided to throw an impromptu ..
baby shower for rachel today .
my daughters told me ..
when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago .
okay , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
for what , dear ?
for not inviting me , or for lying about it ?
oh , my god ! my ass is sweating .
i &apos;m sorry for everything . really , i mean ..
there &apos;s a lot of planning in a baby shower .
you know , things get overlooked and ..
phoebe &apos;s mother killed herself .
why ? did you forget to invite her too ?
oh , you &apos;re so funny .
please , please , can you come ? it starts at 4 : 00 .
well , all right . i &apos;ll see you at 4 .
thank you .
isn &apos;t it at 3 ?
son of a bitch !
the.one.with.the.baby.shower
hey , joe ! wanna shoot some hoops ?
and for the record , i am not covering the tall one this time .
fine , but she &apos;s not that tall .
i can &apos;t go . i &apos;m practicing . i got an audition to be the host of a new game show .
cool !
great !
if i get it , by day i &apos;ll be dr. drake ramoray .
but by night i &apos;ll be joey tribbiani !
you &apos;ll be perfect for this ! that &apos;s already your name !
i know . i know .
it &apos;d be great if i got this because you never know what could happen on a soap .
but i could be a game @-@ show host forever .
like that bob barker guy . he &apos;s been doing the price is right for 75 years .
i bet the ratings weren &apos;t good for the first 25 .
you know , before there was television .
but the problem , this game is really complicated .
come on . you said the same thing about hungry hungry hippos .
and last week , you beat ben .
yeah . i have to be honest with you guys .
he kind of let me win .
the audition &apos;s in a couple hours , and i don &apos;t understand the game .
do you want some help ?
oh , really ? that &apos;d be great . hey , you guys can be the contestants !
we can lose to junior @-@ high girls some other time .
all right . let &apos;s play bamboozled !
bamboozled ?
yeah . isn &apos;t that a cool name ?
yeah !
no !
all right . okay . our first contestant is ross geller .
tell us about yourself , ross .
well , i &apos;m a paleontologist . i live in new york .
i have a son , ben . hi , ben ! and ..
i said , a little bit , ross . how about you , chandler ?
i &apos;m a headhunter . i hook up out @-@ of @-@ work soviet scientists ..
with rogue third world nations . hi , rasputin .
excellent ! let &apos;s play ! chandler , you &apos;ll go first .
what is the capital of colombia ?
bogota .
it &apos;s bogota , but close enough .
you can either pass your turn to ross or pick a wicked wango card .
what does a wicked wango card do ?
i should know that .
let &apos;s see . one moment , please ..
here we are . a wicked wango card determines if you go higher or lower .
higher or lower than what ?
this is embarrassing !
can you believe how lame this is ?
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other .
i told the stripper to be here at 5 . that &apos;s good , right ?
you ordered a stripper for the shower ? that is inappropriate .
why ? he &apos;s gonna be dressed as a baby .
oh , hi , mrs. green . i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
thank you so much . we &apos;re so sorry . we could not feel worse about it .
try .
there &apos;s my little girl !
she &apos;s still mad .
yeah , i know .
isn &apos;t it great ? one less person to make small talk with .
hey , how are you ?
yeah , yeah . okay , okay .
phoebe , sandra &apos;s mad at you too . it doesn &apos;t bother you ?
we &apos;ve apologized twice . i can &apos;t do any more than that .
you hate it when people are mad at you ..
but you just have to be okay with it .
okay . i can do that .
i gotta go powder my ass .
oh .
look at that face ! just like when you were in high school .
if i didn &apos;t know better , i &apos;d say you were a cheerleader in trouble .
come , let &apos;s get some tea .
okay .
oh , my ! look at that . only three weeks to go .
did you pick a nanny ? if you use your housekeeper , it will split her focus .
actually , i &apos;m not gonna use a nanny . and i don &apos;t have a housekeeper .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re a cave person .
you must get a nanny . you don &apos;t know how overwhelming it will be .
when you were a baby , i had mrs. k.
mrs. k ! oh , yeah , she was sweet . she taught me spanish .
i actually think i remember some of it .
tu madre esta loca .
such a sweet woman .
and more important , she became a part of our family .
that &apos;s right , mrs. k. what did that k stand for ?
i have no idea , dear . she was the nanny .
as great as she was , i can &apos;t afford that .
i &apos;m sorry . sometimes i forget not everyone has alimony .
oh , rachel !
what ?
i just had a great idea ! i &apos;m gonna come live with you !
what ? what ?
oh , i &apos;m so happy i &apos;m gonna do this for my little girl .
look at you . you have tears in your eyes .
yes , yes , i do .
ross , you &apos;re in the lead .
would you like to take another question or spin the wheel of mayhem ?
the wheel has not been my friend tonight , joey .
i &apos;ll take another question .
okay . this is gonna be tough . hold your breath .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m ready .
you gotta hold your breath until you answer .
this is ridiculous ! he &apos;s not gonna hold his ..
okay . what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia ? triska ..
holy cow . that &apos;s a big word . trisk ..
look at this . how do you say that ?
let me see that .
this one right here .
triskaidekaphobia .
fear of triscuits !
no ! no . fear of the number 13 .
fear of triscuits ?
it &apos;s possible . they have really sharp edges .
chandler , you &apos;re up .
i &apos;m entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn .
yes , yes . but you can only use it once , so choose wisely .
this is tricky .
i mean , i am in the lead , but i would love another shot at the golden monkey .
this game makes no sense !
you &apos;re upset because you &apos;re losing .
oh , come on , ross . i think we &apos;re all losers here .
i would like to hang on to my angel pass please .
you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card .
let me think , let me think . oh , i don &apos;t care .
you must choose .
either . it makes no difference .
choose , you jackass .
i &apos;ll take a card .
you picked the gimme card !
you get all of ross &apos; points !
what ?
this game is kind of fun !
you don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy that you get my points .. ?
the contestants aren &apos;t supposed to speak to each other .
now , do you wanna start opening presents ..
because it seems like people are getting itchy to leave .
and when i say people , i mean me .
why did you invite my mother ?
what ?
she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby .
for how long ?
eight weeks .
i love my mother , but , my god , a long lunch with her is taxing .
i &apos;d be honored if she wanted to live with me .
she can &apos;t hear you .
what am i gonna do ?
if you don &apos;t want her to move in with you , just tell her .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m about to have a baby .
i can say i don &apos;t want her sleeping on my couch .
she &apos;ll wanna sleep in my bed . this can &apos;t happen .
that is right .
tell her you don &apos;t want her to live with you .
do not take no for an answer .
this is great ! now she &apos;s gonna be mad at rachel !
and i &apos;m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had .
oh , honey , you have to let it go .
okay .
who doesn &apos;t accept an apology ?
i mean , it &apos;s just so simple .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , sandra . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s okay , monica .
i forgive you .
and by the way , you &apos;re very pretty . &quot;
i have new respect for chandler .
all right , everybody ! it &apos;s time to open the presents !
yes ! the first gift that rachel opens ..
should be from the grandmother .
because you &apos;re the most important person in this room ! and in the world !
i don &apos;t have a gift because i wasn &apos;t invited until the last minute .
but thank you so much , dear , for bringing that to everybody &apos;s attention .
how about you less important people ? let &apos;s open your presents !
it &apos;s okay that you didn &apos;t get a gift .
i kind of did .
me ! eight weeks of me .
okay . see , mom , the truth is , i can do this on my own .
i know you &apos;re gonna be a terrific mom .
but you need help at the beginning .
i know what i &apos;m doing . i can handle it .
really ? remember twinkles ?
he was a hamster . i &apos;m not gonna vacuum up my baby !
okay , come on , rach . it &apos;s present time !
you &apos;re the glue holding this party together .
it &apos;s kind of falling apart here .
oh , look !
wow !
this is from your friends at work .
oh , my gosh ! oh , wow ! oh , i know what this is .
wait a minute .
that can &apos;t be right .
is that a beer bong for a baby ?
darling , that &apos;s a breast pump .
did i say i was done guessing ? okay , thank you for that .
oh , wow ! what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a diaper genie .
it dispenses clean diapers !
it &apos;s where you put dirty ones .
why don &apos;t you take it outside and throw it in a dumpster ?
you &apos;re gonna do that 10 times a day ?
what , it goes 10 times a day ?
are we feeding this baby indian food ?
no , dear . that &apos;s what babies do .
rachel , listen to your mother . she is very smart .
what will you do with the baby while you trot out to the garbage ?
i don &apos;t know , i &apos;d leave it on the changing table ?
what ? what did i do ? what did i do ?
you can &apos;t leave a baby alone .
of course , i know that !
of course you never leave a baby alone .
it would .. she wouldn &apos;t be safe .
not as safe as she would be with me , the baby dummy .
opening the presents is a little overwhelming right now .
i &apos;m gonna maybe open them all a little bit later .
thank you for coming , for the gifts ..
and this basket is beautiful .
it &apos;s actually a bassinet .
okay , mommy , don &apos;t ever leave me .

treasure of the sierra madre !
correct ! backwards bonus .

you &apos;ve been bamboozled !
no !
yes !
this is the best game ever !
you &apos;ll stay as long as i need you ?
of course .
i swear i &apos;m not an idiot .
i read books on pregnancy and giving birth .
i didn &apos;t think to read about what to do when the baby comes .
and the baby &apos;s coming ..
and i don &apos;t know what to do . oh , can i throw up in my diaper genie ?
sweetie , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
where you going ?
i &apos;m going to the bathroom .
now , don &apos;t worry . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
it is gonna be okay !
worth a shot .
hey ! why are you all red and sweaty ?
i just bamboozled chandler !
which is not a sexual thing .
well , that was a quick shower .
not if you were here .
looks like we got a lot of good stuff .
we did . my mom got us the greatest gift of all .
a play @-@ doh barbershop ?
no . she &apos;s going to live with us for eight weeks .
what ?
yes ! she &apos;s gonna help us take care of the baby !
you &apos;re not serious !
she &apos;s a very nice woman , but we can &apos;t take eight weeks of her .
she &apos;ll drive us crazy ..
hi , ross !
hey , roomie !
hey , i &apos;m ray . i &apos;m the producer of the show .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you , ray .
this is duncan and erin . they &apos;re gonna help with the audition .
right , ray .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
hello . i &apos;m joey tribbiani . let &apos;s play bamboozled !
erin , first question . in hockey , who is known as &quot; the great one &quot; ?
gretzky .
correct !
want to pick a wicked wango card or spin the wheel ?
didn &apos;t your agents give you the revised rules ?
we &apos;ve eliminated all that . no wheel . no cards .
why ?
it was too complicated . people didn &apos;t follow it .
complicated ? ! spin the wheel to go up the ladder of chance ..
through the rainbow ring to the golden monkey .
you yank his tail , and you &apos;re in paradise pond !
yeah . all that &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s a simple question @-@ and @-@ answer game now .
well , what &apos;s fun about that ?
you expect me to host a boring game of people answering questions ?
women in bikinis hold up the scores .
let &apos;s play bamboozled !
so i thought we &apos;d put the changing station in the living room .
i thought i &apos;d bring in my decorator because i feel like i &apos;m at my best ..
when surrounded by jewel tones .
sure , who doesn &apos;t ?
oh , and all those dinosaur knickknacks you have ..
they might be more at home in the garage .
well , we don &apos;t have a garage .
did i say garage ? i meant garbage .
you know what ? maybe it &apos;s not absolutely vital that you live with us .
well , rachel needs help with the baby .
i really do . i don &apos;t know anything .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s not true .
oh , no ? do i know anything about babies ?
no . not a thing .
it &apos;s frightening .
even if she doesn &apos;t know anything , i do .
and i &apos;ll be there to show her .
that &apos;s exactly what rachel &apos;s father told me .
know what he said at the first 3 a.m. feeding ?
&quot; i &apos;m tired . you take care of it . &quot;
which i later said to him when he wanted to have sex .
well , i &apos;m not rachel &apos;s dad .
and no offense , but he &apos;s an ass .
i do like you , ross .
i have a son . his mother and i didn &apos;t live together .
when he was with me , i took care of him all the time , by myself .
that &apos;s true . you do have another child .
yeah .
with another woman .
have you no control , ross ?
that &apos;s a different issue .
the point is , when the baby comes , i will be there to feed her ..
and bathe her and change her .
i want to do all those things .
you don &apos;t need me to live with you .
yes !
yes . you &apos;re gonna be so missed .
you &apos;ll be a great father .
you &apos;ll be a wonderful grandma .
hello ? i still don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m doing !
every first @-@ time mother feels that way .
you &apos;re gonna pick it up . hey , you will . look , when you first came to the city ..
you were a spoiled , helpless little girl who used daddy &apos;s credit cards !
i hope you &apos;re going somewhere with this .
look at you . you &apos;re this big executive .
you are more capable than you give yourself credit for .
i have no doubt you &apos;re gonna be an incredible mother .
really ?
i &apos;m telling you .
thank you .
all right . i &apos;m gonna get going .
no , sweetheart , stay put .
i &apos;ll let myself out . it &apos;s like i &apos;m not here . which i almost wasn &apos;t .
you &apos;re just so funny . you &apos;re so funny . what do i do ?
nothing . you have apologized to her , like , a million times .
and she &apos;s been nothing but terrible to you .
you just threw her daughter a lovely , albeit slightly boring , shower .
and she hasn &apos;t even thanked you for it .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
if you wanna say anything , i &apos;d tell her off .
really ?
okay , i will .
mrs. green ?
mrs. green ?
it is rude to leave a party without saying goodbye to the host .
when someone apologizes to you , the decent thing to do is to accept it .
what i did wasn &apos;t on purpose .
but what you &apos;re doing to me now is plain spiteful .
spiteful ?
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s time you took a good look in the mirror , young lady !
old lady !
lady !
wrap it up . wrap it up . wrap it up .
so whenever you &apos;re ready to apologize to me , i will forgive you .
good day .
i can &apos;t feel my legs !
you were fantastic ! i &apos;m so proud of you .
yeah ? i &apos;m proud of me too .
you should be .
could you get me something to drink ?
you got it !
mrs. green ? okay , i &apos;m really sorry ! i apologize . if you ..
okay ! i bit my tongue !
but i &apos;m still really sorry !
okay , i &apos;m ready .
you sure ?
i &apos;ve done my studying , and i know my stuff .
all right , then .
rachel green , let &apos;s play bamboozled !
how do you test the temperature of the baby &apos;s bath water ?
put your elbow in it .
excellent !
how do you put a baby down for a nap ?
full , dry , on its back , no loose covers .
correct !
there &apos;s a hopping bonus here , but i don &apos;t suggest you take it .
okay .
this is an audio question . what do you do when a baby makes this sound :
check if it &apos;s wet or hungry , burp it .
excellent ! now do you want another question or a wicked wango card ?
a card ! a card ! i pick a card !
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;ve been bamboozled ! you &apos;re gonna be a terrible mother !
i &apos;ve lost sight of why we &apos;re doing this !
please don &apos;t walk away .
