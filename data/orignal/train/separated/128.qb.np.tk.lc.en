但我还是控制不住 ...
我想每个一百美元比较合适
but we can also always keep track of what you need--
a heart or a liver .
you can extract them intact ?
yes . we know where not to grab .
then we don &apos;t squash the part of the specimen you need .
and you can change its position ?
if we need to . again , ultrasound helps .
with the added dilation , we can change it to a breach .
so ?
so ?
so you have to tell me what you &apos;re thinking .
i can &apos;t guess .
i think you can .
well , you &apos;re against abortion , so my guess is you &apos;re repul ...
i &apos;m a human being . and yes , i am appalled
by a doctor calmly eating yogurt
while talking about selling ...
no , not selling .
$ 100 a specimen .
to preserve , package and deliver .
that is legal .
oh , god , do you hear yourself ? parts of babies .
preserving , packaging and delivering parts of babies .
parts of fetuses .
so you don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything wrong with that video ?
i think it &apos;s shop talk .
i think if you listen to any two doctors ...
or abortionists .
... talking over drinks or yogurt
about an appendix removal , it would sound just as bad .
so you know it &apos;s bad ?
no , i know it &apos;s an effective
piece of propaganda . that &apos;s all .
and why is it so effective ?
because the majority of americans
only support abortion if they don &apos;t have to face the fact
of it , if they don &apos;t have to hear the talk
about where to squash ...
the majority of americans only support anything
if they don &apos;t have to face the fact of it .
how the hamburger ended up on their plate .
except this has a face .
it &apos;s not an appendix .
it &apos;s a human being .
well , that &apos;s the difference between us .
i don &apos;t believe it .
how did you even get it ?
the video ?
citizens for ethical medicine .
oh , god .
that radical anti @-@ abortion group ?
it &apos;s not radical . why is something
radical merely because you disagree with it ?
what , they pretended to be
a bioengineering firm needing human tissue ?
aborted fetal organs .
and what-- you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re planning to do what with that ?
sue .
who ?
her . her organization .
for what ?
well , that &apos;s where you come in .
no .
it &apos;s not about you being a lawyer .
oh , really ? thank you .
it &apos;s about you telling me how mr. dipple can sue .
well , he can grow a uterus .
you don &apos;t have standing .
what are you gonna sue for ?
selling of fetuses .
no .
what , $ 100 ? that &apos;s nothing .
the repositioning of fetuses for a breech birth ?
that &apos;s it .
no .
right ?
you need a woman who had an abortion there ,
a woman who was lied to about the procedures ,
and a woman who suffered measurable harm as a result .
those are the three criteria ?
yes .
you have someone ?
you tell me .
stacy groom . 27 years old .
had an abortion , regretted it .
she fulfills all three criteria .
i &apos;m not asking you to take her case .
i won &apos;t take her case .
i &apos;m asking you to cross @-@ examine her .
do your worst . see if she &apos;s ready for court .
mr. crouse . can you start today ?
sure . what do you need ?
information on this woman .
she regrets an abortion
and is suing the abortion clinic .
what &apos;s the cap on hours ?
cap ?
whenever the work is done , it &apos;s done .
i &apos;m on my way .
the bills are piling up
and we do not have enough revenue
coming in to pay our bills ,
so we need to compensate .
we can &apos;t keep living dui to dui .
i &apos;m open to suggestions .
well , for one thing ,
we need to ration . we &apos;re spending too much
on investigator hours .
should i leave ?
no .
look , we still need to be effective .
we can &apos;t ration our way to success .
then what ?
we cancel our westlaw subscription
and we double our efforts to bring in new clients .
we eat what we kill .
what does that mean ?
it means that lucca and i both get two @-@ thirds
of whatever business we bring in . no more 50 @-@ 50 .
it &apos;ll make us hungrier , work harder .
if you want it , i want it .
i want it .
where you going ?
business lunch .
thank you for agreeing to meet .
what do you need ?
i &apos;m a fan .
uh , here , have some wine .
i ... i @-@ i &apos;d pour it , but it &apos;d ...
... get all over the place .
how exactly are you a fan ?
the t @-@ port case .
you &apos;re scrappy , you &apos;re aggressive .
you deserve better .
what &apos;s better ?
$ 90,000 a year .
another 30 guaranteed as bonus .
plus ten percent of whatever business you bring in .
no , thanks .
you &apos;re four years out of law school , lucca .
you don &apos;t have that much room to negotiate .
oh , i &apos;m not negotiating .
i just don &apos;t want to be bait .
you &apos;re trying to lure alicia , right ?
so , either make it clear why you want me
or save your money .
hey , mom ?
i want to help .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll be fine .
no , mom , let me help . what can i do ?
okay .
cold call .
go through the phone book .
call businesses , one after another .
see if they need legal representation .
where would i start ?
mid @-@ level insurance firms .
and maybe real estate .
how do i know it &apos;s mid @-@ level ?
look at the size of the ad , see how big it is .
okay . and do i get a percentage if i find anyone ?
i thought this was to help .
it is . but do i get a percentage ?
okay . i will give you
half a percentage point for any booking .
one percentage point would be even more of an incentive .
you &apos;re right .
but what i &apos;m offering
is half a percentage point .
stacy groom . i work as a copy editor at myrtle publishing .
did the 8th street clinic perform an abortion on you ?
they did .
ten months ago .
and did dr. hallie fisher perform that abortion ?
the woman on the video ?
yes .
did she accurately represent the procedure to you ?
no .
she tricked me into donating fetal tissue .
she never told me it would be sold .
she even ...
flipped the baby into a breech position to
help better harvest the organs .
and what , if any ,
damages did you suffer as a result ?
well , i , um ...
i cry all the time now .
i can &apos;t eat . i can barely sleep .
it &apos;s , uh , hard to get to work every day .
my work has suffered .
are we boring you , diane ?
no , quite scintillating .
anything ?
you tell me .
why don &apos;t you work for us full @-@ time ?
i like keeping my options open .
we need a dedicated investigator .
you could make more money .
money &apos;s not everything .
yes , but sometimes it &apos;s something .
i &apos;m good .
i may need more of this .
call me .
you said that dr. fisher tricked you into donating tissue ,
but isn &apos;t that your signature there on the release form ?
it is . so ?
so were you under the influence
of anesthesia or some other drug when you signed this ?
no .
so how did she trick you ?
well , she said it was for medical research purposes .
not to make money .
uh @-@ huh . and how do you know it was to make money ?
i saw it on the video .
and is that when you started experiencing
these symptoms-- the symptoms that kept you from work--
right around the time you saw this video ?
i guess .
so the procedure was ten months ago ,
and you &apos;ve been experiencing these symptoms for one week ?
two .
any chance you
went to a doctor and got a diagnosis in those two weeks ?
i haven &apos;t had time .
but you have
had time to go to the church of god in christ
eight times since you joined ... two weeks ago .
uh , what do you mean by &quot; join &quot; ?
well , did you accept the lord as your savior two weeks ago
during an altar call at the church of god in christ ?
is that illegal ?
no , not at all .
but two months ago , did you give this
anonymous quote to the tribune ?
&quot; choice is under attack by right @-@ wing forces
in this country . &quot;
so ?
so it seems like you tend to go from one extreme to another .
how did you get that quote ?
it &apos;s why you pay us .
so what are you gonna do--
bring the case or not ?
not .
really ?
you made your point .
wouldn &apos;t it be odd if the person who respected you the most
was the person you agreed with the least ?
that would be odd .
i &apos;m putting those undercover tapes online
and seeing if anybody takes it seriously .
well , that was easy .
hey , grace , what &apos;s up ?
no , i don &apos;t know anyone in need .
why do you ask ?
are things that bad over there ?
oh , grace , hold on a minute .
but i &apos;m the one who just wrote a check .
grace , i got to go .
i &apos;ll call you if i think of anyone .
uh , ms. paige . hello .
mr. gold . hi .
i was wondering if i &apos;d see you .
eli , please .
do you have a minute ? there &apos;s something i &apos;d like to ...
you know , say or @-@ or discuss .
uh , th @-@ this is temporary .
mm . it &apos;s fine . very ... cozy .
oh , thank you .
actually , i &apos;m sorry , i have to ... could i just ...
oh , sorry .
excuse me .
i have something to discuss .
have i done something wrong ?
no , no , no ... what do you mean ?
well , you sound serious .
oh , well , that &apos;s just
who i am .
i &apos;m working on that .
i ... i told a joke yesterday .
what was it ?
um , how do you ...
no , wh ...
no , i forgot .
it &apos;ll come back .
it @-@ it &apos;s about your business .
and @-@ and actually , it is a bit serious .
i think i know what it &apos;s about .
the salary floor ?
yes .
it &apos;s communism , right ?
no .
socialism ?
no . well ... y @-@ yes ,
it is a bit .
i like my employees . they work hard .
so i decided to give them all a raise .
to $ 75,000 for everybody ?
yeah .
it &apos;s my money .
why is that bad ?
oh , it &apos;s not bad ... for your employees ,
but ... for peter .
oh . ah , he &apos;s suddenly a socialist sympathizer .
all the campaign asks is that you wait
until after the election before you give your raises .
oh , so , there are two fish in a tank .
and , um , one fish says
to the other fish , &quot; how do you drive this thing ? &quot;
that was the punch line , because , you know ,
we @-@ we think they &apos;re in fish tank ,
but actually , they &apos;re in a ... tank tank .
funny .
so , have @-@ have you thought of the legal ramifications
of giving everybody $ 75,000 ?
yes , i &apos;ve discussed it with
my in @-@ house counsel .
how about you hear from a second opinion ?
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
no , i ... what do you mean ?
you yelling at me about landau .
what did you do with landau ? !
wait . why are you here ?
because i have a client .
what happened with landau ?
the election board .
i punted a vote on the machines
by ordering a study , and landau &apos;s furious .
because you two had a deal .
i knew it !
well , let &apos;s just file that one
under ongoing disasters , shall we ?
i &apos;m sending you a client
who just happens to be a billionaire .
courtney paige ?
yes . it &apos;s probably just a couple of hours work ,
but you can bill what you want .
thank you .
yes , that &apos;s all i want is @-@ is ...
is your thanks .
thank you .
and i need you to talk courtney
out of what she wants to do .
i know , i know ,
you can &apos;t promise anything-- that would be unethical--
but she &apos;s planning to give everybody
in her company a raise to $ 75,000 a year .
it is in her best interest ,
both legally and politically , not to do so .
also , it hurts peter .
that &apos;s just my opinion .
i &apos;m not telling you how to advise .
you want to encourage her to chase socialism
to the graveyard of history ...
be my guest .
yes ?
dr. hallie fisher is suing to take down the teaser ,
and block the release of our undercover video .
and ?
and that &apos;s bad .
not for you , but for me .
no , it &apos;s prior restraint .
no judge will allow it .
go ahead , just put it online .
judge margovski already granted
an emergency hearing today .
i know you &apos;re no fan of citizens for ethical medicine ,
but this isn &apos;t about abortion anymore .
this is about the first amendment .
which you &apos;re using as a weapon
to attack women and medicine and choice .
&quot; anyone can defend a sympathetic client
with popular beliefs .
&quot; the real test of the first amendment
is whether we are willing to stand up
for people and ideas we hate . &quot;
well , that &apos;s more persuasive
and plainspoken than you normally are .
i was quoting you .
you said that in a speech to emily &apos;s list .
you may not agree with our tapes or how they were made ,
but prior restraint is just wrong .
and you know it .
why do i have to be so damn convincing ?
dear god !
just remember ,
you &apos;re representing the constitution .
diane , hello . god bless .
i &apos;m heidi . i shot the video .
i &apos;m your client .
hi .
stay away from my uterus !
we don &apos;t want your dirty uterus !
sorry , diane . just ignore her .
you know i &apos;m not pro @-@ life .
yes , i know technically ,
but you &apos;re here to show your support .
no , i &apos;m not here to show anything .
stop killing women !
stop killing children !
this secret tape is already causing irreparable damage
to the important work that dr. fisher does , your honor .
stand up , hallie .
no ! no ! people .
let &apos;s get this clear .
you &apos;re guests here . that &apos;s all .
no waving of signs , no ...
in fact , john , let &apos;s collect those signs , okay ?
thank you . go ahead , counselor .
when i was growing up in the bronx ,
there was one thing i was always told .
sneaks can &apos;t be rewarded for sneaking .
your honor , this isn &apos;t about sneaks .
this is a textbook case of prior restraint .
if we &apos;re against it with the pentagon papers ,
we should be against it here .
now that offends me .
向媒体泄露五角大楼越战文件者
i know danny ellsberg , and this woman is nothing like ...
then sue ... after the fact , if you think there is harm .
the proper remedy is a suit for damages .
she &apos;s not wrong , ms. steel .
the law strongly disfavors this kind of censorship .
yes , except that this secret tape was made illegally .
illinois again requires two @-@ party consent .
hallie , did you consent to this tape ?
i did not .
there . one party .
consent wasn &apos;t necessary here , your honor .
the conversation took place in a crowded yogurt shop .
there was no reasonable expectation of privacy .
of course there was expectation of privacy .
your honor ... she &apos;s alone at a table ...
no , no , no .
let &apos;s look at the tape
and see if this yogurt shop was crowded .
actually , your honor ,
i would suggest that the very reason for this pre @-@ trial motion
would preclude the gallery from seeing this tape , this secret tape .
you want me to clear the court ?
until you rule on our motion ,
your honor , this tape should not see the light of day .
john , let &apos;s go .
all right , everybody ,
i &apos;ll ask you to grab your things , step out .
god bless you , diane . thank you .
there was one day where ,
as i was working my forceps into position , trying to get a good grip ,
i was literally almost doubled over from cramps .
as you can see , your honor--
i think it &apos;s pretty clear-- the yogurt shop was crowded ,
and there was no expectation of privacy .
wait , wait .
is that all you need from the tape ?
yes , your honor . john , bring them back in .
let &apos;s go , everybody in .
okay , go ahead .
there is no expectation of privacy , your honor .
they were three feet from the next table .
which was occupied by children .
so ?
so , like my mom used to say--
stick to the main tent and avoid the sideshows .
what does that even mean ?
it means that children do not undermine the expectation of privacy
because they don &apos;t have the capacity to understand what it means .
but their mother came and joined them at the table ,
and dr. fisher still carried on with no expectation of privacy .
that is not true . look at the tape .
you &apos;re kidding .
sheriff , we need to clear the court .
come on !
i don &apos;t remember when he got divorced .
um , maybe seven , eight years ago . why ?
oh , just curious .
well , eli has a daughter . marissa .
he loves her very much . so do i.
he &apos;s a good guy ... for a political animal .
well , i know why eli doesn &apos;t want a salary floor ,
but what do you think of it , legally ?
well , shareholders may feel devalued ,
and clients may feel insulted .
you think they &apos;ll sue ?
potentially .
senior employees may be upset
that new hires are making almost as much from day one .
you might want to offer a sliding scale
where senior employees get the largest raises .
do you know matthew 20 ?
do i ... ? no .
um , i &apos;m sure my daughter does .
all the hired hands are given the same pay .
the last who arrived and the first who worked in the heat of the day .
why ?
because &quot; the last shall be first
and the first shall be last . &quot;
okay , um , but i do know
that bible stories aren &apos;t usually the best business plans .
yes , but you know what the bottom line is .
it &apos;s your money .
amen .
我们是八号街道诊所
there . that &apos;s the mother .
no kids , no sideshow . adults .
yes , but dr. fisher was whispering ,
which demonstrates her desire to keep the conversation private .
oh , come on . it demonstrates her awareness
that she was in a public place
where she could be overheard .
wait a minute .
sheriff , you know what we &apos;re missing .
oh , do i , your honor .
we &apos;re open for business . hear ye , hear ye .
so what does whispering mean ?
i think it means ms. lockhart is right .
the yogurt shop did not afford a reasonable expectation of privacy .
motion denied . any other motions ?
your honor , yes .
we ask for a recess to prepare a new one .
lockhart , agos &amp; lee . please hold .
bea . i didn &apos;t know we had an appointment .
we don &apos;t , but we need to talk .
ms. wilson , ethan carver .
i recognize you from your appearances for national council on women &apos;s rights .
and i recognize you
from the congressional hearings on defunding planned parenthood .
uh , why don &apos;t you two wait in the office ?
i think that &apos;s a good idea .
how can you do this ?
bea , if you &apos;re talking about this case , it &apos;s not about choice .
it &apos;s about the first amendment .
that &apos;s a nice , neat justification .
the pro @-@ choice position isn &apos;t so weak
that it can &apos;t stand up to the marketplace of ideas .
this isn &apos;t about censorship .
this is about an orchestrated , right @-@ wing war on women .
bea , i will join you in arguing against the substance of these tapes ,
but only after they &apos;re made public .
but that &apos;s insane . we wouldn &apos;t have to argue against them
if they weren &apos;t made public .
oh . excuse me .
hey . i think i know what they have , the opposition .
what is it ?
a non @-@ disclosure agreement .
the citizens for ethical medicine employees signed a nda
at the conference before sitting down with dr. fisher ,
which expressly prohibits any recording or dissemination of information .
i see that . this seems pretty ironclad , diane .
it &apos;s a contract of adhesion , your honor .
it &apos;s an asymmetrical agreement foisted
on someone ill @-@ equipped to know what she was signing .
&quot; ill @-@ equipped ? &quot; really ?
three pages of non @-@ optional legalese .
this is no different than the preposterous user agreements
we all click &quot; agree &quot; on .
there &apos;s a big difference .
the online agreements don &apos;t leave any room
for you to make alterations or amendments .
and , your honor , sneaks ...
can &apos;t be rewarded for sneaking .
i know that , and i agree .
this non @-@ disclosure agreement holds .
do you have any other arguments , diane ?
courtney &apos;s ex @-@ husband &apos;s suing her for breach of fiduciary duty .
what ?
mm @-@ hmm .
he &apos;s still a partner in the company .
i thought her lawyer would know that .
who are you calling ?
well , she wasn &apos;t the duped , she was the duper .
your honor , once again , this is an overbroad interpretation .
listen , if she was not willing to accept the conference &apos;s rules ...
alicia , did you find a new client ?
yes and no . eli referred someone .
not just someone-- a very rich and a very powerful someone .
her husband is part @-@ owner of her company .
i need you to look into him .
his name ...
larry oliver .
did you get that ?
i got it . what am i looking for ?
any weaknesses , vulnerabilities .
maybe it would help to know why they divorced .
jason , do you have a minute ?
i need an answer , now .
you have to go ?
yeah . can i call you back ?
sure .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
yes , i &apos;m calling from the law offices of florrick &amp; quinn .
the midwest offices .
i &apos;d like to set a meeting to discuss what our firm can do for you .
okay , sure . thank you .
good afternoon , i &apos;m calling from the midwest offices of florrick &amp; quinn .
i &apos;d like to set a meeting to discuss what our firm can do for you .
oh , could you hold on a second .
let me close my door .
that &apos;s much better .
would you mind transferring me to whoever deals with outside counsel ?
oh , really ?
you &apos;re looking for a new firm ?
well , that &apos;s great news .
do you mind transferring me to ...
whoever i should talk to .
thank you .
this is bea wilson at national council on women &apos;s rights .
who am i speaking to ?
grace florrick
at florrick , quinn &amp; associates .
i was hoping we could discuss possibly representing your organization
in all of its legal concerns and issues .
and so on .
yes , i would like that .
we &apos;re just in the process of considering moving our legal business .
when would you be able to accommodate us ?
accommodate you ?
as in becoming your law firm ?
yes .
this is florrick / quinn as in alicia florrick , yes ?
yes .
we &apos;ve worked with her before .
when could we make the transfer ?
wh ...
wh @-@ whenever you want .
good .
please call me tomorrow ,
and i &apos;ll send over the necessary papers .
mrs. lockhart ,
if you ever need anything ,
i &apos;m one of the new associates-- brian .
ms. lockhart .
oh , that &apos;s right , sorry .
use me in any way you want .
carrying boxes , killing spiders .
brian , can you give us a minute ?
sure . that i can do .
get out of the way .
good hires , these smart ones .
that was mike and ginger from the justice center .
they &apos;re leaving .
this is a first amendment case .
i know that , and you know that , but they don &apos;t know that .
then have them talk to me .
they don &apos;t want to be argued out of their position .
there isn &apos;t much neutral ground on abortion .
on free speech .
your honor , we will stipulate
that the non @-@ disclosure agreement applied on the premises ,
but the conversation did not take place there .
they met at the conference and were on an officially scheduled break .
off @-@ premises .
you &apos;re saying the conversation wasn &apos;t covered by the non @-@ disclosure agreement
because it happened somewhere else ?
yes .
your honor , we can show that the trip to the yogurt store
was just an extension of the conference ,
but we will need to see the video again .
lucca .
i will see you now .
don &apos;t look now , but the guy i kicked out of your office just walked by .
why would you do that ?
well , where else are you going to work ?
a shared office ? out of your home ?
i haven &apos;t taken the job
and you haven &apos;t made your pitch .
if you really want me here ...
we &apos;re gonna play let &apos;s make a deal .
but if you say &quot; yes , &quot;
you get what &apos;s behind all three doors .
montego @-@ portmore estates .
it &apos;s the second largest hospitality chain in jamaica
and soon to be your client .
your dad &apos;s jamaican ; they &apos;ll like that .
arthur beadle and sons .
the department store ?
yeah , one of the sons had some trouble .
he &apos;s in and out of prison .
your work as a bar attorney will go a long way with arthur .
this one &apos;s special .
inner heart hope ?
they perform low @-@ cost surgeries
in third world nations via remote feed .
they need someone like you .
look , i want you , lucca ,
not alicia ,
so give it some thought
but i need to know within 24 hours .
so ?
you ever hear that joke about the irish guy
who goes to confession ?
i can &apos;t say that i have .
he says he &apos;s committed adultery .
the priest asks ,
&quot; was it mrs. o &apos;leary ? &quot;
the guy says no .
&quot; mrs. o &apos;grady ? &quot;
no .
&quot; mrs. o &apos;donnell ? &quot;
still no .
guy walks out of confessional and says ,
&quot; i got three good leads . &quot;
canning gave you names ?
montego @-@ portmore estates , arthur beadle ,
and inner heart hope .
they add up to $ 10 million .
i called them all on the way over .
we can pitch them tomorrow .
not here-- it &apos;ll look like a hobby .
hey , mom .
i got a client .
that &apos;s great , honey . good job .
we &apos;ll be right back .
hello , florrick , quinn &amp; associates .
this is grace . how may i help you ?
hello , this is ginger gaye from the justice center .
bea wilson from ncw gave me your number
and said you might be open to new clients .
yes . i think we are .
what was your business again , ma &apos;am ?
the justice center .
i know we &apos;re not as big as ncw ,
but we have $ 2 million a year in billing , and growing .
we &apos;re moving on from lockhart , agos &amp; lee .
yes . i mean , we are a little busy ,
but we &apos;re never too busy for a business like yours .
i have a couple minutes . walk and talk ?
great .
as you can see , the conversation starts at the conference
in the hotel and continues as they walk across the street
to the yogurt shop .
ms. steel is right .
the conversation was continuous ,
which makes this meeting essentially
an extension of the conference .
the nondisclosure agreement holds .
the release of the full video is hereby enjoined .
your honor , we ask for a recess
to prepare another motion .
let it go .
granted .
recess for lunch .
ms. lockhart , do you have a moment ?
uh , no , i don &apos;t .
there &apos;s still a way you can fight this .
maybe we can talk another time .
cary .
she &apos;s a whistle @-@ blower .
try the whistle @-@ blower statute .
quote the bible all you want , court ,
but you &apos;re just trying to screw me out of what is mine .
no , larry , i &apos;m trying to make a difference .
which is something you would know nothing about .
i went to cambodia . sri lanka .
all to film footage for citizen nonino .
what do you call that ?
squandering my money on making experimental films
that nobody has or will ever see .
if i may offer a solution .
what if instead of a salary floor ,
your employees received
unlimited vacation and sick days ?
alicia ?
yes . that is one way you could go .
do you , um , rent out that conference room ?
your honor , at this time my client would like to file
pursuant to the illinois false claims act .
the whistle @-@ blower statute ?
all due respect , judge ,
but this is what my mother would call &quot; fercockt . &quot;
who is your whistle @-@ blower ?
she is .
diane , you are amazing .
i admire you so much .
your honor , as my father would say ,
this is like putting an ass &apos;s bridle on a model t ford .
okay , i don &apos;t even get that one .
the 8th street clinic receives
state funding for procedures they perform ,
which they are misrepresenting .
the tapes demonstrate that fraud ,
and therefore they cannot be censored .
it &apos;s a creative claim , ms. lockhart .
please approach .
we need to talk .
this is not ex parte , but we need to talk .
whenever you want , your honor .
now .
diane , what are you doing here ?
your honor ?
please , stop with the &quot; your honor . &quot;
this is just &quot; ben . &quot;
you really think your client is a whistle @-@ blower ?
she was reporting a public fraud .
to whom ?
she didn &apos;t serve notice to this court .
did she notify the sa &apos;s office ?
the attorney general ? the fbi ?
no , but ...
then under the statute
she has not provided proper notice .
then she posted the video online .
are you telling me that this doesn &apos;t satisfy
the spirit of the notice requirement ?
i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s too much of a reach .
and even more so , i don &apos;t understand
why you &apos;re trying so damn hard to make it .
diane , i &apos;ve known you for a long time
and this ...
this is not your case .
are you saying that i shouldn &apos;t pursue this case
because of my politics ?
i &apos;m saying you shouldn &apos;t be pursuing this
because it &apos;s not you .
this is about free speech , and you know it .
no , i don &apos;t know it .
this undercover tape is disgusting .
it &apos;s like james o &apos;keefe with acorn .
it &apos;s like all right wing republicans .
they don &apos;t play fair .
this is ...
you can &apos;t be telling me this .
and yet i am .
i want you to stop trying to make this work .
so let &apos;s go back out there ,
put this to bed , and make sure those videos
never see the light of day .
what happened ?
your plaintiff who had the abortion ,
stacy groom .
the one you ripped apart ?
yes .
we &apos;re putting her on the stand .
thank you for coming .
we @-@ we know you &apos;re very busy .
i am , but ...
as my father would say , wha gwan .
we understand you &apos;re not entirely hap ...
we &apos;d like to tell you about our firm .
it &apos;s not as big as canning &apos;s ,
but we see that as a plus .
do you travel ?
do i ? oh , yes , i love to .
we &apos;re opening hotels throughout the caribbean .
we need manpower . how many partners do you have ?
six , currently .
two .
but what we lack in numbers ,
we make up for in aggressiveness .
and experience , mr. beadle .
at a firm like florrick &amp; agos ,
quinn .
we ... what ? oh . excuse me .
at a firm like florrick &amp; quinn ,
what we &apos;re most proud of is our corporate work .
i &apos;m sorry , not corporate . our charitable work .
so ... we &apos;ll look forward to hearing from you .
well , that didn &apos;t go ... well .
nope .
florrick &amp; agos ?
criminal litigation ?
his son .
no , he doesn &apos;t want to be reminded of that .
plus , six partners ?
i was thinking futuristically .
lucca ...
no , there &apos;s no question .
diane lockhart &apos;s an excellent lawyer .
but we have the expertise ...
one second , jojo .
lippincott mutual .
sorry , jojo .
one of our lawyers is actually dealing with horses .
i know .
good help these days .
so , yes , i actually do think
we can squeeze in a meeting tomorrow .
ms. groom , did the 8th street clinic
perform an abortion on you ?
objection .
what is the relevance of this witness ?
i was wondering that myself .
ms. groom is a private citizen who believes
she has been defrauded and is now reporting it .
here . to this court .
she is our whistle @-@ blower .
objection overruled .
proceed .
ms. groom , did the 8th street clinic
perform an abortion on you ?
they did . ten months ago .
and did dr. hallie fisher perform that abortion ?
the woman in the video ?
yes .
and did she accurately represent that procedure to you ?
no .
she tricked me into donating fetal tissue .
she never told me it would be sold .
she even flipped the baby into a breech position
to help better harvest the organs .
objection .
misstates evidence .
there &apos;s been no testimony to this effect .
are you denying
that ms. groom &apos;s abortion involved a breech ?
no . i &apos;m saying there &apos;s no evidence as to cause .
yes , because you &apos;ve denied us that evidence .
we need a hearing on acquiring the 8th street clinic &apos;s medical records .
objection sustained .
do you have any more questions for this witness , ms. lockhart ?
i do not .
ms. groom , these symptoms you discuss ,
have you reported them to a doctor ?
yes . i received a ptsd diagnosis .
really ?
when was that ?
yesterday .
yesterday ?
great . before your testimony here .
objection , your honor .
overruled .
you said that dr. fisher tricked you
into donating tissue .
how did she do that ?
she said the donation was for research purposes
and my health wouldn &apos;t be compromised .
and it wasn &apos;t , was it ?
she said on the video
babies are moved into a breech position .
ms. groom , when did you join the church of god in christ ?
objection , your honor .
goes to state of mind .
no .
it is an indictment of this woman &apos;s beliefs ,
and that &apos;s outrageous .
what happened to constitutional freedoms ?
this woman was pro @-@ choice . she had an abortion
of her own free will ...
yes . yes .
uh , absolutely .
sure .
well , when ?
okay .
uh , tomorrow .
thank you . okay .
bye .
nice picture of you and the pope .
thanks .
did you decide what you wanted to do
with , you know , the unlimited vacation days ?
eli , what are you doing here ?
why am i ...
i thought that you wanted me to stay .
and your concern is governor florrick ?
yes . what do you mean ?
well , it &apos;s important to understand motives ,
don &apos;t you think ?
always .
unlimited vacations is a ploy .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s cynicism disguised as benevolence .
and you know that .
i know ... h @-@ how do i know that ?
oh , give me some credit .
when companies offer unlimited vacations ,
employees take even less vacations .
they &apos;re so paranoid about pulling their own weight ,
they don &apos;t even use their usual two weeks .
that was not my intent .
well , then ... what is your intent ?
what are we talking about now ?
you &apos;re in my office .
the door is closed .
you still trying to &quot; help &quot; me ?
i &apos;m not good at this .
what is this ?
you &apos;re beautiful .
and i &apos;m ...
well , i have my moments , but ...
my office is the size of your bathroom .
and i don &apos;t have ...
the money you have .
come here .
okay .
well , i &apos;m sorry we won &apos;t be working together .
yeah . thank you for your time .
that was the last one .
i thought canning &apos;s clients would be easier to pick off .
what do we do ?
mom ?
yeah , grace , just give us a minute .
no , actually , i think you want to hear this .
i got four new clients .
that &apos;s great , honey . i &apos;ll be in in a few minutes .
ncw . justice center .
preservation basin . and jojo lee &apos;s company .
excuse me ?
excuse me ?
ncw .
the justice center . preservation basin .
and jojo lee &apos;s company .
i ...
you @-@ you talked to them ?
yes .
ncw ?
who did you talk to at ncw ?
um , bea wilson .
bea wilson ?
the bea wilson ?
well , a bea wilson .
how did you get all those firms ?
apparently they &apos;re unhappy with diane lockhart .
so , can you make time to meet with them ?
y @-@ yeah . yeah .
the reason we haven &apos;t been able to produce the medical records
to substantiate our claim is that we have been denied
the minute @-@ by @-@ minute procedure notes .
you have no basis for discovery .
it &apos;s a catch @-@ 22 , your honor .
i need the evidence they have to get the evidence they have .
that is a problem , ms. lockhart . for you .
well , you could fix it with an evidentiary order .
let me think about that .
no .
your honor , per illinois rule
735 ilcs 5 / 2 @-@ 1001,
i would like to file a motion for substitution of judge .
you &apos;re asking meto remove myself from this case ?
yes .
on what grounds ?
political bias .
motion denied . there is nothing in the record
to reflect any bias on my part ,
political or otherwise .
there is nothing on the record
because you pulled me into chambers
for an improper ex parte conversation .
you stop right there !
which revealed
your bias against both me and my clients &apos; case .
denied ! again .
want to keep getting knocked down ?
it is not fair that you , who are biased ,
get to rule on your bias .
it is fair . and you are way over the line .
your honor , i am asking ...
ms. lockhart , i have made my ruling !
you &apos;re welcome to proceed with your case .
and i assure you
i will give it all the consideration it deserves .
i &apos;m sorry . i tried my best ,
but i &apos;ve just become a liability .
it &apos;s in your clients &apos; best interests for me to withdraw .
nicely played .
you found a way out without backing down from anyone . kudos .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
okay . but it &apos;s time to get our clients back .
i &apos;m on it .
here we go .
we did it .
bravo .
jason , you &apos;re just in time .
for what ?
to celebrate .
new business . new life .
and we owe it all to grace .
well , congratulations .
oh , mom , do you have a minute ?
sure . thanks for all your help , grace .
no problem .
um , so it works out to $ 35,800 .
for the year .
what &apos;s that ?
a half percent of the billable hours .
that &apos;s what you owe me .
cash or check is fine .
