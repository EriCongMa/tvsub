how much can you actually accomplish in an hour ?
run an errand maybe ?
sit in traffic ?
get an oil change ?
when you think about it , an hour isn &apos;t very long .
60 minutes .
3,600 seconds .
that &apos;s it .
in medicine , though ,
an hour is often everything .
we call it the golden hour .
that magical window of time
that can determine whether a patient lives ...
or dies .
thank you , doctor .
are you gonna help me at all
or are you just gonna sit there and eat potato chips ?
i performed four back @-@ to @-@ back fem @-@ pop bypasses today .
this is the first chair i &apos;ve seen since 7 : 00 a.m. ,
and this is the first food i &apos;ve had since yesterday .
i choose potato chips .
you might want to get that .
seattle grace mercy west emergency .
you brought this on yourself , you know ?
you volunteered to help run the e.r. ?
got it .
we &apos;ve got a suspected appy on a 10 year old .
let &apos;s page robbins .
you know , i saw a need and i filled it ,
like any good chief resident candidate .
sadomasocochisc chief resident candidate maybe .
what is up with you ?
you &apos;re all perky and cheerful .
ah , you know , it &apos;s the , uh , fertility drugs .
we have stepped it up . i &apos;m pumped full of hormones .
you know what &apos;s perky ?
quoi ?
my boobs . they &apos;re huge .
am i supposed to like big boobs ?
oh , god , no . they &apos;ll make you fall over .
callie mentioned a thing .
or it might not be a thing .
at least i hope it doesn &apos;t become a thing .
hey , i got a patient with a headache better after sumatriptan .
he &apos;s ready to be discharged .
just need you to sign off .
is he neurologically intact ?
you did a c.t. ?
i did . it was negative . the most interesting thing
about this guy is that he came into the e.r.
for a glorified migraine
with a girlfriend from hell .
ooh , which one is she ?
just point with your eyes .
here . thank you .
so , um , callie had a thing .
yeah .
what kind of a thing ?
grey , you paged ?
yeah , we have a suspected appy on a 10 year old
two minutes out .
okay .
an unexpected thing .
grey , call up . tell &apos; em to get an o.r. ready .
i already did . o.r. five is prepped and ready for you .
callie asked me to be her baby &apos;s godmother .
well , you said no to that , right ?
you gotta say no to that .
e.k.g. results .
thank you .
the guys at work overreacted and insisted i come to the e.r.
sweetie , i had a big lunch . it hardly qualifies as chest pain .
no , what i need are some antacids .
i &apos;ll be there . i promise . just tell max to put on his jersey .
okay ? i &apos;ll be outta here soon .
hi , i &apos;m dr. grey . i &apos;ll be your doctor today .
oliver richter . sorry about the phone .
i &apos;m supposed to be picking up my son for the huskies game right now .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll understand .
you don &apos;t know my son .
there are very few things more important to him than basketball .
big fan , huh ?
i &apos;m just gonna take a quick listen .
all right .
the biggest 9 @-@ year @-@ old fan you &apos;ve ever seen .
okay . so it says here
that you &apos;ve been experiencing some chest pain .
when did that start ?
uh , an hour ago , maybe two ?
but i &apos;m already feeling much better .
and you wouldn &apos;t just be saying that to get discharged faster ?
look , i got my son tickets to this game for his birthday .
he &apos;s been marking off the days on his calendar for weeks .
i can &apos;t be the reason he misses it .
okay . well , your e.k.g. looks normal ,
and your heart sounds good , but if there &apos;s one thing
we don &apos;t take lightly around here , it &apos;s chest pain , so ...
could we go back and just pretend i said heartburn ?
would that get me out any faster ?
no , probably not .
but tyler is going to do a portable chest x @-@ ray .
and we &apos;re gonna do a chest pain workup ,
and we will try to make it as quick as possible .
thanks , dr. grey , so much . thanks .
so ... this is gonna be a thing .
why am i telling callie no again ?
um , while you &apos;re here ,
i need a second opinion on this e.k.g.
do you see anything ?
no . looks , uh , normal . what are you doing here ?
thought you had the night off .
yeah , i do . i &apos;m not here .
what &apos;s medical records &apos; extension ?
looks like you &apos;re here to me , which is good ,
because we &apos;re swamped . take your pick--
impacted bowel , suspicious rash , or really smelly guy .
forget it . i only came in &apos; cause medical records called
and said i had to sign all my unsigned charts
or they would suspend my privileges .
you &apos;re getting suspended ?
dibs on his solo splenectomy tomorrow .
i better be able to finish this crap before the game tonight .
told a patient yesterday he didn &apos;t have cancer ,
and he was so happy , he gave me two floor seats .
you took a gift from a patient ?
did you tell him you cured his cancer ?
uh , colectomy time . i &apos;m out .
excuse me . hi , i @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
uh , we were told that somebody would be by
to set our son &apos;s leg-- nathan englundar .
it was a while ago . several hours , actually . and i was--
no , i know . you &apos;ve been here a while . i &apos;m sorry .
the problem is , we just don &apos;t have enough o.r.s available
for non @-@ emergent cases .
an o.r. ? why would you need an o.r. ?
your piatrician hasn &apos;t been by to speak to you yet ?
your son has a broken femur , which is a severe break .
it requires a full cast on the broken leg , connected to
a cast on the other leg to keep everything still
so the bones will heal properly .
2 full @-@ leg casts on a 4 year old ?
and because your son is so young ,
we can &apos;t set the bones properly without
putting him under .
under meaning anesthesia ?
and that requires an o.r.
i &apos;m sorry . i know you &apos;ve been waiting a long time .
as soon as an o.r. opens up ,
i &apos;ll let you know .
thank you . thank you .
the losers in medical records aren &apos;t answering .
are you sure you can &apos;t stay
and help out with some of this stuff ?
floor seats .
i understand what you are suggesting .
i know it is done by many medical professionals in this hospital .
but i am not a medical professional
who would ever consider--
maybe you should consider it .
eli lloyd ... do not test me .
maybe you should consider the potential benefits .
all the intensely exciting , toe @-@ curling potential ...
benefits .
dr. bailey .
okay , uh , this is gonna be
for a prescription @-@ strength migraine medicine .
just don &apos;t take it with alcohol .
okay .
we &apos;re missing our anniversary dinner
because you have a headache . a headache .
do you know how hard it is to get reservations at this place ?
i &apos;m sorry , gia . i am . but it really hurts .
hi , i &apos;m dr. grey . i &apos;ll be--
oh , mrs. webber .
hi , dear . how are you ?
i &apos;m fine . how are you ?
does the chief know you &apos;re here ?
oh , please don &apos;t bother him .
i had a little fall is all .
got home from work , slipped off the stepladder--
landed on my wrist .
oh , it &apos;s basasically nothing . ohh .
well , it &apos;s not nothing .
well , i @-@ i brought lots of magazines and a good novel .
i am perfectly fine waiting until you make time for me .
i know you have far more pressing patients .
well , you &apos;re the chief &apos;s wife ,
so that makes you my most pressing patient .
look , stew @-@ man . they opened the doors right for us .
are you sure about that ?
this is gonna be fast . we &apos;ll be in and out , man .
but i can &apos;t believe you wouldn &apos;t let me drive , dude .
dude , you &apos;re drunker than i am .
i can &apos;t believe you tried to stiff the cabbie .
wow , it is bright in here .
hey , could somebody do something about this ?
you &apos;re a little early . i thought our date was at 6 : 30 .
well , i &apos;m here now because a guy just walked into the pit
with a knife sticking out of his head .
sweet .
i mean , poor guy .
is he stable ?
he &apos;s neurologically intact , but--
all right . well , i need to check on him sooner than later ,
so , avery , take him down to c.t.
stay with him until i get there .
all right . will do .
okay , so you &apos;ll be down
to see knife guy when you &apos;re done ?
i will .
and then we &apos;ll have our date ?
wouldn &apos;t miss it .
6 : 30 . don &apos;t forget .
how did this guy get a knife in his head ?
oh , apparently there was a brawl at a tailgate party .
so you know how stupid guys get--dr . bailey .
uh , i &apos;m taking a nap .
uh , i &apos;m sorry .
what i @-@ i mean to say is ,
i &apos;m going to use this room to take a nap ,
because that &apos;s what people do in these rooms
when they &apos;re tired ,
&apos;cause i @-@ i have a child and a full @-@ time job ,
and work long hours ,
so i &apos;m just tired ,
just very ... ve tired .
okay .
okay .
i @-@ i was just gonna ask you , had you seen dr. altman ?
d--no , i have not seen dr. altman
nor any other doctors or nurses ,
because i will be in this room asleep , by myself .
actually , i see her now . dr. altman .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i ...
dr. altman , do you have time for a quick consult ?
i was supposed to be off by 6 : 00 , but--
oh , okay , sure . okay . just walk with me .
okay , so-- oh , damn it .
he &apos;s early . um ...
all right , just , uh , grey , give me a second .
hi , uh , william .
hey . it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s nice to see you .
wow . you look amazing .
oh . so official .
i mean , i @-@ i knew you were a doctor ,
but you ... are a doctor .
thanks . sorry , i didn &apos;t-- i didn &apos;t have time to change .
i &apos;m just--
no , no , no . the scrubs are strangely sexy .
thanks . um , you know , i have a few things to wrap up .
do you mind hanging out for a few minutes ?
like , uh , ten tops ?
yeah , no problem . take your time .
i &apos;ll just , uh , grab a seat here .
hey , stranger .
henry .
i didn &apos;t , uh , i didn &apos;t-- i didn &apos;t know that you were ,
uh , you were here today .
they wanted to run a blood glucose test on me ,
so they gave me this nasty orange kool @-@ aid to drink .
in about an hour , i gotta go give &apos; em some blood or pee .
and we don &apos;t really need to talk about my bodily fluids .
sorry to be rude . hi . hey .
oh , sorry . um , yeah .
william , henry . henry , william .
are you , uh , are you a patient of teddy &apos;s ?
something like that .
anyway , i , um , i @-@ i gotta go .
uh , but i &apos;ll be back soon .
promise .
all right , grey , what do you got ?
okay , 42 @-@ year @-@ old male ,
um , complaining of midsternal chest pain .
no cardiac risk factors , no angina .
pain doesn &apos;t radiate . the e.k.g. looks clean .
these are his films ,
and they &apos;re mostly clear .
but i don &apos;t know .
does the mediastinum look a little wide to you ?
because i know , sometimes that can happen
with the portable x @-@ ray .
you got cardiac enzymes ?
yes .
hey , kepner .
how good are you at forging signatures ?
even if i were good at forging signatures , i wouldn &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s unethical and probably illegal . so i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re just gonna have to finish signing your charts on your own .
i &apos;ll check on mr. richter right now . call radiology .
get him in for p.a. and lateral films ,
and tell &apos; em to rush it ,
because i &apos;d really like to get outta here and go on my date .
i mean , did you see that guy ?
no forging snatures , karev .
radioly , please .
forgery , huh ? why am i not surprised ?
whatever . i just want to get outta here
so i can get to this game tonight .
wait . you have tickets ?
tonight ? it &apos;s the pac @-@ 10 title game .
yeah , i know .
win this , and the huskies get
an automatic bid to march madness .
why do you think i &apos;m powering through all these stupid charts ?
hey , what are you d-- what are you doing ?
of my ten patients in labor right now ,
none of &apos; em are past 3 centimeters ,
which means , i have some time to kill ,
and you can &apos;t miss this game . hand me a pen .
i thought you thought i was loser .
well , you &apos;re a little less losery ,
now i know you like college hoops .
hey , where &apos;s the knife guy ?
is it true he &apos;s walking and talking ?
what about your colectomy ?
postponed .
the wife snuck him a cheesebuburgrger and fries
before surgery .
so this thing with callie--
i mean , you know it &apos;s a bad idea , right ?
you don &apos;t want to be callie &apos;s baby &apos;s godmother .
i don &apos;t ?
no .
i mean , think of how many people have to die
before you even get to step up--
mark , callie , and arizona .
that &apos;s a lot of people .
it is , yes . a lot of dead people .
right .
whereas if you &apos;re my baby &apos;s godmother @-@ in @-@ waiting ,
it &apos;s only me and derek .
one wrong turn down a dark , twisty road ,
boom , you &apos;re in .
okay , let &apos;s be clear .
if i am ever a godparent to anyone &apos;s kid ,
it will be in name only .
i will not be taking care of children .
that &apos;s what boarding schools are for .
which way to butcher block ?
trauma 2 .
okay . i understand you might be thirsty , but i &apos;m sorry .
you cannot drink beer in here .
you &apos;re wasting it !
oliver , did you see dr. altman ?
yeah , she &apos;s sending me off for another x @-@ ray .
look , i know you guys have to cover all your bases , but--
no , i know . i &apos;m sorry .
but i put a rush on the x @-@ ray ,
so hopefully it &apos;ll be quick , okay ?
grey !
excuse me .
i was finishing a surgery just now
when a scrub nurse asked me how my wife was feeling ,
because she &apos;d heard adele was in the e.r. , and i hadn &apos;t .
now would you like to explain to me why i found out
my wife was a patient in this hospital
from my scrub nurse and not from you ?
richard , hush . let meredith do her job .
she hasn &apos;t even had a chance to examine me yet .
is that true ?
don &apos;t mind him , dear . he &apos;s just worried about me .
he gets gruff when he &apos;s worried .
i hurt my wrist .
i was trying to get out the holiday decorations
and i--ohh--i slipped off the stepladder .
oh , it was stupid . i should &apos;ve waited for richard to get home .
he &apos;s so much taller than me .
i requested an x @-@ ray and an ortho consult .
i will call and make sure that they &apos;re coming down .
don &apos;t touch that !
ooh . i think i better go see what that is .
you better .
is everything all right ?
yes .
no !
i was just showing these guys how ,
when i scrunch up my eyebrows , the knife move . see ?
oh , my god ! my god !
stop ! whoa . don &apos;t do that !
stop moving the knife !
okay , okay .
you guys should &apos;ve seen the brawl .
stew @-@ ball kicked that other guy &apos;s ass !
okay , and now stewball has a knife in his head .
oh . okay , let &apos;s focus . stewart , how much is 14 plus 4 ?
18 .
27 minus 13 .
15 ?
no .
172 minus 60 .
i have no idea , but it &apos;s not because of the knife .
it &apos;s just &apos; cause i &apos;m so drunk .
no , actually , it &apos;s just &apos; cause he &apos;s dumb .
thanks , david . really ?
unbelievable . his mental status is completely intact ,
if you don &apos;t count for his math skills .
it &apos;s like the knife did no damage at all .
so why don &apos;t you just pull the thing out ?
&apos;cause we got a games to gets to !
i &apos;ll drinks to that ! whoo !
no ! no beer !
buzzkill .
uh @-@ oh !
how many do you have ?
okay . oliver &apos;s in x @-@ ray ,
stewart is stable and waiting for derek ,
who should be here soon ,
adele is waiting on ortho ,
and , uh , can i get the discharges from the last hour , please ?
oh , and , uh , the boy in bed seven with the broken leg ,
nathan englundar-- let &apos;s check on the status
of the o.r. for him , please .
is this lexie &apos;s patient with the headache ?
yeah .
mitch turner ?
how long ago was he discharged ?
not long . a few minutes ago .
did he leave ? did he already leave ?
mr. turner !
mr. turner , i need you to try to smile for me , please .
who the hell are you ?
i need you to try to smile for me , please .
okay , can you lift your arms above your head like this ?
dr. grey , is everything all right ?
no , it &apos;s not .
we got a code c.v.a. let &apos;s get stretcher out here , stat .
can you repeat after me ? &quot; the dog chased after the cat . &quot;
&quot; the-- dog ch @-@ chased af-- &quot;
what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s happening to him ?
okay , i need you to help me .
what &apos;s happening to him ? !
we need to get him on the ground .
&quot; the dog ch-- &quot;
okay , get your purse under his head .
quickly , please .
&quot; the dog ch-- &quot;
okay . and help me secure his arm . hold it like this .
o @-@ o @-@ okay , but wh @-@ why are we doing this ?
because he &apos;s having a stroke .
unsteady gait , slurred speech , asymmetric smile .
his symptoms started no more than 20 minutes ago ,
so we should be well within the golden hour .
okay .
i know--a stroke , right in front of me .
i mean , what if he had been driving me
in the car when it happened ?
oh , wait . hang on . here &apos;s the doctor .
hi . so the stroke team has taken him up to c.t.
we &apos;re gonna see if he &apos;s eligible for the clot @-@ busting medicine .
we caught the stroke early , which is very good .
so--so on a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being i might have to cancel our aspen trip in a week ,
how is he ?
you should cancel the trip .
you will not believe this .
looks like the blade landed in the maxillary sinus .
chances are , the knife itself is tamponading any major bleeding .
probably best just to go ahead and open up the cranium .
or we could just take him to the o.r.
and pull this thing out .
really , avery ? just pull it out ?
let me guess . you want to get out of here early
to go to the game , just like everyone else .
or since it looks like the blade didn &apos;t hit any major arteries or veins ,
he knows that a controlled extraction would be both safer and less invasive
than a complete craniotomy .
is that true , avery ?
is that why you suggested we pull it out of his head ?
yeah . and i want to get outta here early to get to the game .
me , too . i &apos;m good with that .
let &apos;s just do what he said . yeah !
lexie , i need to speak with you .
thank you for getting me out of that room .
i swear , it takes everything just to be civil to mark lately .
such an ass . what &apos;s up ?
take a look at this . look closely .
what do you see ?
this is the patient &apos;s admitting signature when he came in .
and this is his signature when he was discharged .
oh , no .
mitch turner , the patient you just discharged ,
is up in radiology being treated for a stroke .
oh , god .
i know you know the signs of a stroke .
how did you miss this ?
are you distracted by the mark thing ?
is that it ?
no , i checked the c.t.
he was having a classic migraine .
he &apos;s had them before .
there &apos;s no way that he was having a stroke
when i treated him .
lexie , i know you know ,
this kind of headache can be a precursor to a stroke .
when you said you needed an ortho consult ,
you could &apos;ve mentioned it was the chief &apos;s wife , grey .
i would &apos;ve been down here a hell of a lot sooner .
i am so sorry to keep you waiting , mrs. webber .
you hurt your wrist in a fall ?
oh , it was so silly .
i &apos;d just gotten home , and i was trying to get some--ohh !
reach something on the top shelf myself .
i @-@ i just landed wrong .
her wrist absorbed all the impact .
yeah , it looks painful . we &apos;ll get you some more pain meds to
help you out with that . uh , your x @-@ ray shows a hairline fracture .
oh . so it could have been a lot worse .
we &apos;ll splint you up and get you out of here in no time , okay ?
you have me paged if you need anything , okay ?
thank you for covering for me before with the chief .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
excuse me ?
when you said i hadn &apos;t been by to examine you yet .
so you said that
you fell when you got home ... from work .
yes . yes , that &apos;s right .
do you remember hitting your head when you fell ?
not that i recall .
dr. grey , i have the new x @-@ rays for oliver richter .
okay . let &apos;s get mrs. webber a head c.t.
oh , damn it .
excuse me .
sorry to make you wait .
no , no problem . um , really .
henry here has been keeping me company .
although he &apos;s probably sick of me by now .
i &apos;ve been grilling him about the major leagues .
you didn &apos;t mention he used to play pro ball .
oh ... i didn &apos;t know that he did .
it &apos;s not a big deal , really .
although there is a baseball card out there with my face on it somewhere .
look , i don &apos;t mean to hold you guys up .
you probably have a @-@ a reservation waiting .
excuse me , dr. altman . mr. richter--
mediastinum looks borderline on the p.a. films . take a look .
okay , um ... that reservation
may have to wait just a @-@ a little bit longer .
i &apos;m sorry . i mean , if you want to reschedule , i totally--
no . nonsense . i &apos;m--i &apos;m happy to wait .
you are saving lives .
least i can do is take you out to dinner when you &apos;re done .
thank you .
did you--you ever pitch against jeff bagwell ?
once ,
and it wasn &apos;t pretty .
you were right . get a c.t. to be safe ,
and i &apos;ll stick around to look at the results .
at least somebody &apos;s having a good night .
good news ?
or not such good news ?
oliver , your second x @-@ ray is still concerning .
dr. altman and i agree that you should have a c.t. ,
just to rule out anything serious .
and how--how long will that take ?
oh , that &apos;s my son calling .
he &apos;s worried we &apos;ll miss tip @-@ off . what should i tell him ?
do i need to tell him we &apos;re gonna miss this game ?
i wish i had an answer for you ,
but i think it &apos;s a safe bet you &apos;ll be late .
max . hey , buddy .
how &apos;s my little man doing ?
oh , daddy will be fine .
don &apos;t you worry . don &apos;t worry .
you just worry about all that popcorn we &apos;re gonna be eating .
make sure he &apos;s on broad spectrum antibiotics .
you booked an o.r. ?
wow . it didn &apos;t hit any brain matter at all ?
doesn &apos;t look like it from this .
how long till shepherd gets down here to take a look ?
he should be out of surgery any minute .
good . longer that thing stays in there ,
the higher the risk of infection ...
one , two ...
or abscess formation .
so now can we get outta here ?
how is he , grey ?
pupils are equal and reactive . he &apos;s alert and awake .
can i get some more gauze for this wound , please ?
reflexes seem normal .
give me that .
i &apos;m fine . it &apos;s just a little headache is all .
i &apos;ve had hangovers worse than this .
all right . what &apos;s the status on the blade ?
well , about that--
yeah , there is no blade anymore .
what , uh , what happened ?
sir , just lay back and let me examine you , okay ?
could we just get a doctor , please ?
i want to take a look at the c.ts.
it &apos;s okay , bud . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s gonna be okay , nathan .
mommy , help me .
he &apos;s really hurting .
okay ,
i &apos;m gonna write an order for more pain meds .
it &apos;s okay , monkey . i know you want to go home .
it &apos;ll just be a little while longer , okay ?
it will just be a little longer , right ?
tyler , where is the o.r. for nathan ?
i haven &apos;t heard back yet .
okay , well , let &apos;s call them again , and let &apos;s call
the ortho team and make sure they &apos;re ready to go , okay ?
we will get to nathan as soon as possible . i promise .
how &apos;s he doing ?
well , the blade went through his skull ,
didn &apos;t hit any major nerves or arteries ,
so he &apos;s gonna be fine .
flesh wound ?
yeah .
i mean , that &apos;s the luckiest guy alive .
you &apos;re also pretty lucky , too .
it &apos;s past 6 : 30 , and we haven &apos;t had our date yet .
i &apos;m swamped . i can &apos;t leave .
i have one patient in c.t. , another one waiting for an o.r.
well , your patient &apos;s c.t. isn &apos;t ready yet .
no .
and the o.r. you &apos;re waiting for isn &apos;t either .
so okay . i mean , maybe i do right at this precise moment
have one minute , but it &apos;s a minute .
that &apos;s perfect .
that &apos;s all i need is a minute . i need a minute .
what--aah !
oh , sorry .
what ? !
no one . it was nothing . that room is occupied .
uh , just never ask me what i might have seen
or might not have seen in there .
okay , well ,
if we can &apos;t go in there , where are we gonna go ?
i have an idea .
where are we going ?
nowhere . we &apos;re gonna do it here .
wait . no we &apos;re not .
come on .
no ! no way ! are you kidding me ?
no . drop your pants .
come on . i &apos;ll be quick . i &apos;ll be in and out .
oh , my god .
eyes up here ! seriously . are you kidding me ?
no , i &apos;m serious about this .
where is your sense of adventure ?
my sense of adventure is down on the first floor .
it &apos;s not in this elevator .
come on . if not for me ,
then do it for your future baby .
come on . turn around .
i cannot believe i am doing this .
this future imaginary baby of ours better be worth it .
okay . here we go .
ooh . oh , there it is .
ouch .
ooh . there . i told you i &apos;d be quick .
i can &apos;t wait to meet our future fictitious baby .
me either .
we got through those charts fast .
floor seats , here i come .
so i just helped you get through three dozen charts
in a fraction of the time
would have taken you to do on your own ,
basically ensuring you get to your floor seats on time .
how long do i have to wait
till you ask me to go to the game with you ?
oh . i ... i @-@ i mean , i was supposed to take avery ,
but screw him .

i just wanted to see if i could get you to ask me out .
excuse me .
just admit it . you like her .
shut up .
god , i don &apos;t think you do understand , actually .
this has been going on since yesterday .
we took our son to an after @-@ hours clinic
where he was misdiagnosed , and then he was sent home
without so much as a painkiller , and he was up all night crying .
and then this morning , our pediatrician sent us here .
and now we &apos;ve been waiting around all day ...
with our 4 year old son .
believe me . i understand that a kid with a broken leg
doesn &apos;t take precedence over a guy with a knife in his head ,
but my son is scared and he is in pain ,
so could somebody please just get to his leg all ready ?
please .
yes , sir .
you still haven &apos;t helped that kid yet ?
he &apos;s 4 with a femur fracture . you know how much that hurts ?
no , i know . it &apos;s just been one of those days .
tyler , isn &apos;t that o.r. ready yet ?
they &apos;re prepping it now .
grey , my wife was cleared by dr. torres .
you ordered a head c.t. for a broken wrist ?
yeah , i can explain that , sir . i have some concerns--
dr. grey , they &apos;re calling from c.t.
your patient &apos;s coding in the scanner .

uh , he was coding whenen i got here .
i defibrillated him three times .
i gave him three rounds of epi , two of atropine .
i loaded him up with amiodarone , but he &apos;s tachycardic now .
i mean , he &apos;s barely hanging on .
he needs surgery . book an o.r ..
okay . i &apos;ll get a room prepped and ready .
no time .
his aorta &apos;s dissecting as we speak .
he needs surgery right now .
they &apos;re saying all the o.r.s are booked .
well , tell &apos; em to bump someone ,
&apos;cause we &apos;re come up either way .
i have an o.r.
tell &apos; em to bump mine and prep it for an emergency cardio .
all right . here we go .
got it . go .
all right . let clear it .
let &apos;s hold that elevator !
come on . come on . come on .
once these doors open , we &apos;re gonna have to get him in the o.r ..
and open him as soon as possible .
i know .
even then , if that aorta tears ,
we may already be too late .
and we &apos;re not gonna have time to scrub .
i know . i know .

it doesn &apos;t need to be pretty . we need to get in there .

this guy thought he had a bad case of heartburn .
he went from that to this in less than 45 minutes .
that &apos;s how these work . how &apos;s his pressure ?
70s and dropping .
retractor .
every beat of his heart rips this tear a little bit wider .
all right .

have you caught in time to operate ?
40 . maybe 50 .
how many have you been able to save ?
three .
all right . i &apos;m in .

he &apos;s bleeding out .
his aorta is wide open . all right , clamp .
come on ! come on ! come on !
here .
all right , grey . let &apos;s try sucker bypass .
cannulas .
it &apos;s not working . there &apos;s too much blood .
all right . well , once we get him on bypass ,
it &apos;ll be easier to control .
heart &apos;s fibrillating .
all right . cardiac massage .
paddles .
i &apos;ve almost got him cannulated .
charge to 10 . clear .
damn it . he &apos;s bleeding out of his nose and ears .
i &apos;ve been loading him up with blood , f.f.p. and factor vii ,
but i can &apos;t keep up with the losses .
foley &apos;s full of blood , too .
he &apos;s dic .
his cannula sites are oozing .
let &apos;s push 3 of epi . set me up for another shock .

there &apos;s nothing . his aorta is in shreds .
well , what about-
there is nothing left to do . call it .

grey , we got here too late .
these are almost impossible to catch .
there is nothing that we can do . i &apos;m sorry .
we need to call it .
time of death-- 18 : 52 .
hey . i heard you lost a patient .
you know , it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to share you .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to share you ,
but that &apos;s not the reason i don &apos;t want you to be
callie &apos;s baby &apos;s godmother .
oh . okay .
it just seems like , if you agree to be
callie &apos;s baby &apos;s godmother ,
you &apos;re saying that i &apos;ll never have a baby of my own .
meredith , you know , i--
i &apos;m in no way saying anything that--that--
i know . it just feels that way .
okay .
okay .
well , i , uh ...
have to go have really uncomfortable conversation
with callie now .
how about you ? what are you up to ?
oh , i have to contact oliver &apos;s family .
oh , hey , hey , hey , wait . you got , uh ...
blood or something .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
hey , chief .
about earlier--
it &apos;s all taken care of .
i checked adele &apos;s head c.t. myself .
it was clean . her wrist is in a splint .
and i &apos;m taking her home now .
well , i still have some concerns .
and if her c.t. was clean , then i have even more concerns .
thank you , meredith , but i assure you , adele is fine .
chief , she &apos;s been get things very confused .
meredith , she is fine , and i &apos;m taking her home right now .
why was she getting christmas decorations down in february ?
good night , meredith .
and she said she had just gotten home from work .
didn &apos;t she retire ?
meredith--
chief , something isn &apos;t right .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
now i know what you &apos;re implying .
and while i appreciate your concern , that &apos;s enough .
adele had a scare today . she had a fall .
any number of things could account
for her mixing up a couple of details ,
not the least of which is her being interrogated by you .
now if something bigger were wrong with my wife ,
i would know it .
you &apos;ve got alzheimer &apos;s on the brain .
i mean , you--you buy a car
and you start seeing it everywhere you look .
now you &apos;ve been working on this alzheimer &apos;s trial 24 / 7 .
i get it .
but adele is not your mother , meredith .
she &apos;s my wife .
now good night .
hi . i &apos;m so sorry .
i got pulled into an emergency surgery .
where is nathan ?
actually , a @-@ a doctor came by to get him a little bit ago .
he &apos;s getting his casts put on right now .
great . that &apos;s great news .
dr. grey , we have a surgical abdomen in bed three .
okay , let &apos;s just get oliver richter &apos;s chart .
okay .
hello .
hi , max .
this is-- no , it &apos;s your daddy &apos;s doctor .
is your mom around ?
an hour ...
one hour ...
can change everything ...
forever .
well , we &apos;ll have to keep you overnight for observation ,
but your prognosis is very good .
great .
so maybe we don &apos;t have to cancel
our aspen trip after all .
i just had a stroke .
i know .
and you &apos;re worried about our travel plans ?
well ... it &apos;s a nonrefundable trip .
cancel the trip .
you know what ? in fact , cancel all our trips .
how have i put up with you for two years ?
i &apos;m done with this .
we &apos;re done .
get outta here .
now , before you give me another stroke .
w @-@ wait , wait .
can i see your keys ?
yeah .
okay .
now you can go .
an hour can save your life .
* that &apos;s not as cool as my city *
so before he gets off the phone
and since i now have to go pee in a cup ,
uh , here is i have to say , this-- i basically spent the past hour
on a first date with william myself .
and i don &apos;t know how m much you know about the guy ,
but this is what i know--
um , he wears driving gloves .
yeah , and he doesn &apos;t live with his mother ,
but until recently he lived above her house ,
and he used the word &quot; shant , &quot; and he wasn &apos;t being funny ,
and he has yet to tell me a story about himself
in which he is not the hero .
so as , uh , as your husband ... i think we can do better .
good news . not only was i able to push the reservation ,
but i also got us a a table by the window .
black truffle gnocchi awaits . ready ?
ready .
an hour can change your mind .
* be patient as long as i know how *
so when &apos;s your next break ?
okay . unh @-@ unh . no .
this ... will
never happen again at work . understood ?
sure .
okay .
until your next break .
sometimes an hour is just a gift we give ourselves .
all right , stewart , you &apos;re choosing to leave
against medical advice , so you &apos;re free to go ,
but this is my number .
now if you experience any of the neurological symptoms
on this sheet , you call me , all right ?
somebody should stay with you tonight
and have plenty of fluids-- not beer . not beer .
will do , doc .
thanks , doc .
all right .
for some , an hour can mean almost nothing .
i can &apos;t believe he walked in with a knife in his head
and is walalking out an hour lar to go to a ball game .
speaking of which ...
any chance you want to go to the game , too ?
apparently karev didn &apos;t want his floor seats .
so you interested ?
actually , yes .
yes , i am .
* be patient as long as i know how *
for others ...
an hour makes all the difference in the world .
now , nathan , when you wake up ,
you &apos;re gonna have two big casts on your legs .
but that &apos;s a good thing , because it means
it &apos;s gonna make your leg better , okay ?
but right now , i have a very important question for you ,
and that is , what is your favorite color ?
blue .
blue it is , then .
let &apos;s prep the blue casting material , please .
all right , i &apos;m gonna take this mask , nathan ,
and i &apos;m gonna lower it ...
but in the end ...
it &apos;s still just an hour ...
one of many ...
many more to come .
60 minutes ...
3,600 seconds ...
that &apos;s it .
and then it starts all over again .
hi , i &apos;m dr. grey . i &apos;ll be your doctor today .
it says here you &apos;ve been experiencing some abdominal pain .
when did that start ?
