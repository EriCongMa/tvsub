does elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar ?
i love you . now look me in the eye and tell me
that you don &apos;t feel something for him .
drink it .
i just turned about a hundred times in the appalachian mountains .
broke his sire bond .
it &apos;s easier said than done .
klaus drew this for you ?
does klaus have a thing for you or something ?
i would know if i were killing people .
you wear a ring that lets you cheat death , ric .
how many times can you die before it changes you ?
are you telling me
that your vampire hating alter ego has a stake
that could kill an entire line of vampires , possibly mine ?
there &apos;s only one stake out there .
which means only one original has to die .
i want them all to die .
you &apos;re not rebekah .
my name is esther .
and we have a great deal in common .
what took you so long ?
alaric didn &apos;t want to hand over the stake .
luckily i &apos;m quite the charmer .
that &apos;s it ?
the last of the white oak stake that can kill us .
do you want to do the honors or shall i ?
well that &apos;s that then .
pack your bags , we &apos;re leaving .
today ?
why not ? there &apos;s nothing keeping us here ,
we &apos;ll grab the doppelganger and be off by sunset .
but tonight is decade dance .
so ?
so , i &apos;m head of the committee , we have to go .
i &apos;m not going to any dance .
caroline will be there .
that means nothing to me .
please i have big plans for tonight .
just go for me .
okay , fine .
one last hurrah .
one last hurrah , nik .
where you &apos;ve been , i &apos;ve been calling you all day .
yeah , sorry about that .
i ... i just need to get my head together .
so , i take it rebekah got the stake .
i don &apos;t know , i woke up alone ,
and um ... there &apos;s no sign of it .
lovely . , what now ?
well , i think i need to get out of town .
you know , somewhere secluded .
i keep blacking out which means i &apos;m still a threat to everyone .
but i don &apos;t know if right now is the best time
for you to be going on a spirit quest , ric .
just for a couple of days .
i &apos;m stock up on bonnie &apos;s herbs , so i should be fine .
i gotta go .
quite the cunning liar .
damon &apos;s too arrogant to think his only friend would betray him .
just as niklaus would blindly accept
an invitation from his beloved sister .
unaware that he &apos;s heading to his own death .
did you give him the stake ?
he burnt it without hesitation .
so where &apos;s the real one .
you &apos;ll get it when it can no longer be used against me in this body
so how do you ...
how do i return to my true form ?
with a little magic ,
and some help from a vampire hunter .
so alaric is trying to pull himself together .
why is that a bad thing ?
i just ... i wish there were something i could do .
where do you want me to hang this thing ?
you know what ?
if rebekah wants to hang this monstrosity ,
she should &apos;ve shown up and do it herself .
just .. no .
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t just hang them .
they &apos;re suppose to trickle down .
look at them all bromancy .
yeah , i ask matt to help jeremy readjust .
he got him his old job back at the grill .
that was nice of him .
jeremy &apos;s got a lot on his mind .
the whole thing with alaric has got him really stress out .
you &apos;re sure it has nothing to do with witnessing you and damon
getting hot and heavy in a skeevy motel ?
i didn &apos;t tell you that so you can torture me with that .
what are friends for .
so , who are you bringing to the dance .
what do you mean ?
i thought you and bonnie and i are going as ...
girl date .
bonnie has a date .
what ?
jamie called and wanted to see her , so ...
she asked him .
so here &apos;s a thought .
why don &apos;t you ask stefan .
i can &apos;t ask him on a date .
i just made out with his brother .
all the more reason .
look you &apos;re suppose to figure out what you want .
that &apos;s what stefan wanted you to do .
right ?
yeah , but ...
but nothing .
i &apos;ve watched the bachelor , okay , fair is fair .
it is stefan &apos;s turn .
yeah , and you &apos;re not bias or anything .
i &apos;m sorry , but stefan is your epic love .
and i &apos;m not going down without a fight .
do ... do you have a second ?
yeah , everything all right ?
yeah , yeah , i just ...
i wanted to ...
caroline and i were talking about going to dance , and ...
okay , look ...
i know i know where we &apos;re at , you and i ...
and i know it would be stupid to even think that
we can go back to how things were , but ...
i &apos;m going to the dance , and i &apos;d like to go with you .
i &apos;d love that .
okay , great .
bye .
i &apos;m thinking gardenia corsage .
wrist obviously , you don &apos;t want to
accidently stab her in the chest with the pin ,
that could get messy .
damon , i ...
meredith ...
don &apos;t do that it &apos;s not funny .
oh , come on , it &apos;s a little funny .
what do you want , damon ?
i need medical advice , for a friend ,
alaric , you remember him , right ?
about six foot two , tried to hack you into pieces .
how is he ?
are those herbs that bonnie made for him working ?
i don &apos;t know , can they work if he doesn &apos;t take them ?
i found these in his loft , untouched .
why are we here ?
long ago on this spot , my son tore my heart from my chest .
the violence of my death mark this ground for all time .
i &apos;ll need your ring .
and why would i give you the one thing that protects me from death ?
i would give you all the protection you need .
however , the stake will burn up in the body of its first victim .
if you are to kill all of my children ,
i would need to bind the protective magic in your ring to the stake .
thus rendering the white oak indestructible .
the ultimate weapon
for the ultimate hunter .
you look very dapper .
you look , uh ...
very beautiful .
here . i , uh ...
i got something for fou .
thank you .
so given our dangerous dance karma ...
you sure you &apos;re up for this ?
getting out of bed is dangerous these days ,
but we have to live our lives .
who gave you that horrible advice ?
some guy i used to date said it once or twice .
right .
shall we ?
please .
have i told you how amazingly awesome you are ?
yeah , i am one of the good ones . i know .
why the compliments ? what else do you want ?
i know that you and elena
have been getting closer lately .
and your point is ?
one way or the other ,
she &apos;s pretty much spoken for .
elena &apos;s my friend , caroline .
i &apos;m just looking out for her .
and i &apos;m just looking out for you ,
because sometimes the people who love her
get caught in the crossfire .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
are you crazy ?
if klaus sees you--
what &apos;s he gonna do ?
draw you another picture ?
tyler , this isn &apos;t a joke .
i could pretend i &apos;m sired if i have to .
but i &apos;m not gonna hide while he &apos;s macking all over you .
tyler ...
you do not need to be jealous of klaus .
i am jealous ,
but i &apos;m also competitive , so hang on .
i &apos;m about to sweep you off your feet .
teach me some moves .
oh , no , no , no , no . i , uh--
i blacked out for most of this decade , remember ?
nice try .
bonnie seems happy .
she &apos;s working on it .
i &apos;ve been meaning to talk to her ,
apologize .
yeah , you should .
although i wouldn &apos;t expect her to forgive you
or damon .
listen , stefan ,
about damon ,
we should probably talk about the trip to denver .
i don &apos;t need to know , elena .
when all this is over ,
if you and i find our way back to each other ,
you can tell me if you want to .
otherwise , i don &apos;t need to know .
i don &apos;t want to know .
how can you be so fair about this ?
because after everything i &apos;ve put you through ...
i &apos;m just honored to be your date tonight .
we three need to talk .
sorry . uh--
hey . bonnie .
w @-@ why are you still wearing your ring ?
didn &apos;t elena tell you ?
yeah , yeah , i know all about alaric .
my sister stops hanging out with vampires ,
i &apos;ll take it off .
a , uh , ex @-@ boyfriend ?
yep .
that &apos;s not awkward at all .
if alaric &apos;s sick , then we need to find a cure , something .
we tried medicine . we tried magic .
why don &apos;t we get him off vervain , compel him ?
to do what , pretend to be alaric ?
the guy that we know is gone .
we &apos;re talking about someone who not only hates vampires ,
but vampire sympathizers ,
which makes one of his most obvious targets--
i don &apos;t know--you .
what ? you think he &apos;d go after elena ?
so wait . what are you suggesting we do ?
i &apos;m suggesting that we put him out of his misery .
what ?
no way in hell .
oh , come on . it &apos;s what he would want . it &apos;s a mercy killing .
you are out of your mind .
jeremy--
jer , stop .
this is alaric we &apos;re talking about .
you know , he looked out for us ,
and we need to do the same for him .
no one &apos;s gonna hurt him .
hey . look at me .
i promise .
elena .
if you wish to help your friend alaric ,
i suggest you come with me .
jeremy , go inside and get stefan and damon now .
i mean you no harm ,
but willingly or not ,
you will come .
salt .
it &apos;s the binding agent for a spell .
we &apos;re trapped here .
you had all kinds of moves out there .
yeah ? i mean , i was just , you know ,
trying to make a good impression .
well , consider me impressed .
your friends seem pretty cool .
they &apos;re the most important thing
in the world to me .
though you gotta admit ,
this whole circle of people , it &apos;s kind of crazy .
i mean , there &apos;s vampires , werewolves ,
ex @-@ boyfriends with magic rings .
i mean ...
i &apos;m just a normal guy .
a normal guy wouldn &apos;t have said yes to a date with me .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
sorry to spoil your 7 minutes in heaven .
we have a problem .
you &apos;ll forgive me for taking you from the dance this evening .
that &apos;s the burden of being the doppelganger , i &apos;m afraid .
your blood is a potent binding agent for a witch &apos;s spell .
just please don &apos;t hurt alaric .
she &apos;s not hurting me .
ric .
what &apos;s going on ?
what are you doing with him ?
i &apos;m going to remake him .
remake him ?
make him strong , fast ,
like my children ,
indestructible .
for one final time ,
i &apos;m going to tap into the dark magic i used a thousand years ago .
like my husband mikael before him ,
i will make alaric into a true hunter ,
the vampire to end all vampires .
you can &apos;t create another original .
what if he turns out to
be an even bigger monster than your children ?
he won &apos;t ,
now that he &apos;s embraced his darkest aspect .
his hatred for them will become more pure and uncompromising .
in death , that hatred will be magnified .
you don &apos;t know that .
you don &apos;t know anything about him .
that is where you &apos;re wrong .
each time he died with that ring ,
during his brief journey into death ,
i was there on the other side .
i spoke to him . i nurtured him ,
knowing that every death brought him closer to his true self .
vampires took everything from him .
now he &apos;s getting his vengeance .
what is it ?
where have you been , mate ?
i just got back in town .
that &apos;s funny .
i don &apos;t recall giving you permission to leave in the first place .
you don &apos;t mind if i cut in , do you ?
yes , actually , we do .
no .
it &apos;s fine .
why do you always have to prove you &apos;re the alpha male ?
i don &apos;t have to prove anything , love .
i am the alpha male .
come on .
one dance .
i won &apos;t bite .
you would have loved the 1920s , caroline .
girls were reckless ,
sexy ,
fun .
they literally used to dance until they dropped .
i don &apos;t suppose that ever happened to their dance partners .
you should be nicer to me .
i &apos;m leaving town tomorrow .
i &apos;d invite you to come with me , but we both know
you &apos;re not ready to accept my offer .
perhaps one day ,
in a year or even a century ,
you &apos;ll show up at my door
and let me show you what the world has to offer .
you mark my words .
small @-@ town boy , small @-@ town life ,
it won &apos;t be enough for you .
rebekah , call me back immediately .
i only came to this ridiculous dance because you begged me to ,
and now you &apos;re nowhere to be found .
what is this ?
your mother &apos;s back .
merabas hec libatal confremun signas .
omus quisa tentum , exalus .
merabas hec libatal confremun signas .
omus quisa tentum ...
she does this all the time , right ?
what &apos;s taking so long ?
all boundary spells have a loophole .
people are walking right out of the dance , past the barrier .
well , if matt and i can leave ,
we could stop esther ourselves .
we just gotta find out where she is .
suicide , jeremy .
suicide would be disappointing me .
now work your magic , witch ,
or i &apos;ll start killing people you fancy .
let him go .
not until you get us out of here .
ah , don &apos;t be stupid , klaus . bonnie doesn &apos;t give a damn about us .
the only reason she &apos;s helping
right now is to save caroline and tyler .
if you start killing the people she cares about ,
she &apos;ll tell us all to go to hell .
ric , this isn &apos;t what you want .
it &apos;s not who you are .
you don &apos;t know who i am , elena .
you only know the weakest parts of me ,
a man who lost his way ,
be friending vampires instead of killing them .
you don &apos;t mean that .
they &apos;re all monsters .
the blood of their victims is on my hands ,
jenna &apos;s blood is on my hands .
when you are ready .
no , ric , please don &apos;t .
don &apos;t do this .
i won &apos;t help you .
i &apos;m not gonna give you my blood . you &apos;re gonna have to kill me .
that won &apos;t be necessary .
drink and let it be done .
no , ric , please don &apos;t .
no .
is it finished ?
not just yet .
here . jeremy made a little gilbert blood donation
for your locater spell .
i have to do this with you two lurking over me ?
you &apos;re still mad at me for what happened to abby .
let me apologize .
i &apos;m sorry elijah forced us
to turn your mother into a vampire
to save elena &apos;s life .
didn &apos;t exactly have a choice .
there &apos;s always a choice .
whenever you make one , someone else suffers .
let &apos;s cut the dramatics and begin , shall we ?
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras
sequitas saguines
ementas asten mihan ega petous .
esther &apos;s fighting me .
esther couldn &apos;t possibly have this much power .
no , she &apos;s channeling something .
a hotspot .
get the humans ready .
i know where she is .
they &apos;re at the old cemetery .
jeremy and matt are headed there right now .
you let them go ?
they &apos;re gonna get themselves killed .
we didn &apos;t have a choice , caroline .
we &apos;re useless right now stuck in here .
hey , she &apos;ll be fine .
elena always manages to find her way through this stuff .
yeah , well , i &apos;m just as worried about what esther &apos;s up to .
she led klaus here for a reason .
if she succeeds in whatever she &apos;s doing--
klaus could get killed ...
and i die along with him .
no one &apos;s gonna die , ok ?
bonnie &apos;s still looking for a way around the boundary spell .
it &apos;s not too late .
so best @-@ case scenario ,
bonnie gets us out of here ,
klaus hauls ass to timbuktu ,
and you and i , we &apos;re home free .
or we let esther come and kill him .
that &apos;s not a best @-@ case scenario .
that &apos;s not even a remotely acceptable scenario .
it would be an option if we knew
he wasn &apos;t the one who turned your bloodline .
you &apos;d be safe .
at least he &apos;d be gone .
how could you say that ?
because i &apos;m angry .
because i hate him .
i should have never let him dance with you .
what were you supposed to do ?
he can &apos;t know that you &apos;re not sired anymore .
tyler , it doesn &apos;t matter how many times i dance with him .
i love you .
he &apos;ll wake soon .
when he does , he may for a time be his old self .
if so , you can say your good @-@ byes
before his transition is complete .
you said you wanted to undo the evil that you created ,
but this-- this is just as evil .
alaric will never be what my children became .
i have granted him enough power to complete his task .
then when the time is right ,
he will die .
how , if he &apos;s immortal ?
all you need to know is that when this is over ,
we will have rid the earth of vampires once and for all .
yeah , but you &apos;ll be killing the good along with the bad .
you &apos;re no better than klaus .
am i not ?
i desire a world where you and your loved ones
will not suffer at the hands of vampires ,
like your aunt jenna did .
don &apos;t you dare use jenna as an excuse for what you &apos;ve done .
you may draw comfort knowing
that your aunt is not in the place that i was .
she doesn &apos;t know the torment of the other side .
though made a vampire ,
she remained pure ,
and she knows peace ...
which is all any of us can hope for .
don &apos;t move .
where &apos;s elena ?
jeremy ?
let her go .
how foolish of you to risk your lives
in defense of those who will kill you .
but if that is your choice ...
matt . matt , drop your gun .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m not controlling it .
esther , stop it .
oh , god .
wh @-@ where &apos;s my ring ?
tell me what happened .
you know , this is your fault .
you set us on this path when you released my mother .
i wonder if revenge will prove worth the cost .
oh , i &apos;m done with revenge .
as far as esther ,
we &apos;ve stopped her before .
we &apos;ll stop her again .
we are strange bedfellows , you and i.
you know , all of this reminds me
of our time together in the twenties .
you say that like i &apos;m supposed to have happy memories about it .
well , there were moments ,
real friendship ,
brotherhood .
oh , he already has a brother .
not to be , you know , territorial or anything .
oh , no , of course .
the salvatores and their unshakeable bond .
i wonder what &apos;ll happen when elena finally makes her choice .
will we see you shake
just a little bit ?
it &apos;s done .
esther &apos;s not fighting me anymore .
the boundary spell is broken .
thank you , bonnie .
for everything .
i didn &apos;t do it for you .
damon &apos;s here ,
and klaus took esther &apos;s body .
does he know about the stake ?
no , only that she tried
to turn you into a weapon and failed .
what &apos;s going on ?
listen , jeremy ...
i &apos;m not gonna complete the transition .
my dark side was dangerous enough as a human .
i can &apos;t be a vampire .
so , what , we &apos;re just gonna lock you in here and let you die ?
no . no , we can &apos;t .
listen , jeremy , it &apos;s the right thing to do , ok ?
after everything that &apos;s happened ,
after--after all that i &apos;ve done ...
maybe i had it coming .
hey , wait , jer .
alaric , this isn &apos;t your fault .
please , you guys , let &apos;s not make this any harder than it already is .
you two should go .
damon &apos;s here .
he &apos;ll make sure it &apos;ll all go down the right way .
don &apos;t .
just don &apos;t give me some crap speech
about how i need to be the man of the house .
ok .
i won &apos;t .
this is all my fault .
you moved out . you--you gave me your ring back .
you didn &apos;t want any part of this .
and i--i forced you to stay and take care of us .
don &apos;t do that .
ok ?
taking care of you and jeremy has been ...
it &apos;s been the closest i &apos;ve ever come to the life i always wanted .
you should go .
your trap failed , mother .
i live , and i will go on living .
let your beloved spirits try to preserve you again .
i dare you to come after me .
i will build an army so big ,
no one will ever touch me .
my survival will haunt you through eternity .
you will never destroy me !
thanks for the ride home .
no problem .
you know there &apos;s nothing you could have done , right ?
i know .
that doesn &apos;t make it any easier .
i should have said this before , but ...
thank you for protecting me .
apparently it &apos;s what i do .
you really are pretty amazing .
sometimes i think i &apos;d settle for just ordinary .
you said your dad &apos;s out of town , right ?
you gonna be ok by yourself ?
no .
i don &apos;t think i am .
mr. saltzman .
alaric .
we can handle this later , you know .
no , i &apos;d rather get it over with now ,
before some janitor comes to clean out alaric &apos;s stuff
and realizes the history teacher was a vampire slayer .
elena ...
hey , elena , please .
i can &apos;t , stefan , ok ?
i--i can &apos;t think about the fact
that jeremy and i don &apos;t have anyone
to take care of us anymore .
or--or that we &apos;ve lost another friend .
i just can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t think about any of it .
i want you to come with me .
i &apos;m not done .
please .
we were in this gym the night klaus
compelled me to turn my feelings off .
i thought i hit rock bottom in the twenties , but ...
after i bit you , i never wanted to feel anything again .
but someone ...
kept telling me that it was ok to feel ...
no matter how much it hurt ...
that our emotions would make us human ,
good or bad ,
and to never lose hope .
who gave you that horrible advice ?
some girl i used to date .
i don &apos;t have anyone anymore .
you have me .
i gave him a sedative .
he &apos;ll fall asleep first .
he &apos;ll go comfortably .
i offered to snap his neck ,
put him out of his misery , but ...
he didn &apos;t take me up on it .
you seem surprised .
well , you just think a guy so used to dying
wouldn &apos;t want to drag it out .
oh listen , it was nice of you to give him the option .
apparently my choices
have been a little controversial lately .
you shouldn &apos;t leave him alone in there .
that &apos;s the way he wants it .
is that really what you think he wants ?
ric .
is this the part where you give me a dream ?
rainbows and rolling green hills ?
i was drunk when i told you that .
yeah , and i told you i &apos;d use it against you .
damn you .
sorry i killed you .
twice .
so i have to actually die to get a real apology out of you .
drink ?
actually i &apos;ve been thinking about cutting back .
yeah .
this stuff &apos;ll kill you .
here you go .
your sisters need you to finish what i started , bonnie .
bonnie .
hey . hey .
i think you &apos;re having a bad dream .
what are you doing here ?
hey , bonnie ,
what , are you sleepwalking or something ?
bonnie ?
no , bonnie .
