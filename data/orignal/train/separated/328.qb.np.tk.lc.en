miss ?
i have to apologize .
well , not to me , but i &apos;m sure the amish are pissed
that you &apos;re gaying up their look .
i don &apos;t have enough money for the tip .
weird . you survive the diner chili ,
and it &apos;s the waitress that kills you !
but i can tip another way .
i &apos;m a psychic .
so , uh , you already know
where they &apos;re gonna find your body .
oh , please . i die in a bridge collapse
you have nothing to do with .
i can tell you your future .
ha ! you &apos;re wrong . i don &apos;t have one .
see the guy in the booth over there ?
jared &quot; leto himself go &quot; ?
he just offered to read my future as my tip !
ha ! you don &apos;t have one .
miss , let me read your palm .
sir , coming over here right now is not a good idea .
we don &apos;t like to be stiffed by strangers .
in six months , maybe , but we &apos;re not there yet .
i &apos;m a legit psychic .
i predicted long hair was coming back
in time to have long hair when it did .
okay . you can read my palm .
i could use some good news .
i could also use some hand moisturizer--sorry .
i see two ms ?
you bitch ! have you been holding out on m &amp; m &apos;s ?
is it the male model i &apos;m managing
who &apos;s also making it with max ?
actually ... i see a small failure .
i take it back . you are good !
here &apos;s your chocolate lemon crumble .
sounds like it shouldn &apos;t work together , but it does .
it &apos;s the tony bennett and lady gaga of desserts .
max , can i have just a wee bite ?
a crumble of the crumble ?
caroline won &apos;t let me eat anything
because of my big photo shoot .
hurry !
no chewing , no enjoying . just swallow .
spit that out !
no !
i said spit that out !
you &apos;re a model now ! shame on you !
bitch , he &apos;s starving .
he &apos;s not eating , is he ?
i don &apos;t want the stay puft marshmallow man
showing up at my girlfriend &apos;s photo shoot .
i haven &apos;t eaten anything since tuesday !
this morning , he tried to swallow his toothpaste ,
but i was right there to stop him .
good , honey .
that kind of heartlessness is why i &apos;ve decided
to make you the manager of our hot new location of the high .
oh , my god ! this is so exciting !
someone &apos;s finally realizing my full potential ,
and it &apos;s not me !
will i be able to make max head pastry chef ?
and where is this new location ?
well , right now , everything &apos;s under wraps
the way my face was six months ago .
but as manager , you can hire your own staff ,
and i &apos;ll even let you poach max .
i &apos;ll also tell you the new spot is amazing .
it &apos;s international . it &apos;s a hub .
i &apos;m talking major flagship .
honey , i get that you &apos;re happy ,
but enough with the eye contact .
no one can look me in the eye .
i &apos;m the medusa in chanel .
任何直视她双眼的人都会被石化
max doesn &apos;t let me look her in the eyes during sex either .
i told you , eye contact &apos;s extra .
max , did you hear that ?
major flagship !
uh , did someone just call me a major flag ?
i think you did , and if i don &apos;t get to
go to the new place with you two ,
i &apos;m telling hr .
that &apos;s hector rodriguez , my therapist .
would you be interested in coming to the new high
as part of our team ?
if you say &quot; part of our team &quot; again ,
i &apos;ll rethink the whole thing .
i &apos;ll take it .
but i have to be upfront with max .
i don &apos;t like it in the back .
which , by the way , is what i say to all my dates .
samesies !
well , this is great news .
how about we celebrate with a piece of pie ?
no !
earl , we have great news . guess what it is .
no , don &apos;t . okay , guess . no , don &apos;t . yes , guess , guess !
can we hurry this along ?
my cousin is on maury povich today ,
and i wanna find out if he &apos;s the father .
&apos;cause then i can stop paying child support .
sorry . she &apos;s a little amped .
she hasn &apos;t had good news to share
since we found out the washing machine
in our basement takes buttons .
han ! we have good news .
sure , you do .
and i &apos;m playing center for the new york knicks !
have you seen the knicks lately ?
he can only help .
well , according to my time card ,
i &apos;ve been here for six hours already ,
so i &apos;m gonna head back and catch some zs .
the mattress is all yours , max .
hey , everybody . we weren &apos;t expecting company .
i came by to discuss wedding details with oleg
while we had intercourse .
what is this , the bunny ranch ?
baby , i think these are yours .
yeah . yeah .
well , thank you , honey .
can we just make it a general rule
that there &apos;s no fornication in the diner ?
or in han &apos;s apartment , ever .
okay , max and i have some really exciting news .
yeah , yeah . we know all about the buttons .
oleg !
i think you crushed my seating arrangement !
i &apos;d like to think so .
so , back to us .
how &apos; bout back to work ?
max and i ...
need to do some work !
there . end of news .
where are you running off to so fast ?
is someone having a sale on smaller heads ?
i &apos;m too small , i &apos;m too big--pick one !
here &apos;s our big news .
you are looking at the manager
and the head pastry chef of the brand @-@ new high location .
actually , he &apos;s looking at our kneecaps .
okay , so we &apos;re going with too small .
if you two quit the diner , how will i ever replace you ?
unless i hire ...
literally anyone else !
no , han , we still have to work here at night .
we have more debt than jada pinkett @-@ smith
has excuses for will not being home .
but at the new high ,
we &apos;re gonna be the big bosses calling all the shots .
yes , yes ... by day .
but by night , you &apos;ll be the coleslaw &apos;s bitch .
don &apos;t listen to him .
clearly , han just resents our success .
i know !
why can &apos;t women ever just be happy for each other ?
wow , that is really hot .
yeah .
the milder salsa &apos;s right here .
listen--oh !
do girls eat now ?
wow ! lena dunham changed everything !
原创并主演了hbo剧集 《 衰姐们 》
listen , which one of you is sleeping with the model ?
i know one of you said you were ,
but i don &apos;t listen when you talk .
she is .
this is a massive ad campaign ,
and i don &apos;t know how else to say this ,
but i need his penis to look bigger .
oh ! yeah ...
it gets nervous when you shine a light on it .
sometimes i hear her coaxing it out of its crawl space
with treats .
well , do something .
i haven &apos;t touched one since college ,
and even then it was just to look under it for my keys .
max , take him off set . be professional .
how professional can i be ?
she &apos;s asking me to fluff his nutter .
yo , nash ! break time .
so ... marie .
did joe tell you about my big new job promotion ?
of course she did . we &apos;re lesbians .
talking is most of what we do .
it &apos;s why we rule daytime .
eh ... pardon me .
you , maybe . that coat--never .
i &apos;m lookin &apos; for someone .
you also look like an extra from angela &apos;s ashes .
从美国回到爱尔兰的故事
but this is a private shoot ,
as in we &apos;re shooting someone &apos;s privates .
i &apos;m looking for me son .
okay , people ! the groundhog &apos;s outta the hole !
six more inches of winter .
用土拨鼠来预测该年是早春或是还有六周冬日
that &apos;s him ! that &apos;s me boy !
ma ?
ma , how did you know i was in new york ?
aw , no , you saw me in the today show window ,
背景是一面连着大街的落地窗 能看到许多围观者
didn &apos;t ya ?
you checked into &quot; america &quot; on facebook ,
you bleedin &apos; idiot .
i flew all the way and been lookin &apos; for you day and night
in this dirty , god forsaken city for a week .
i &apos;m takin &apos; you home .
ma &apos;am , nash can make his own decisions .
he &apos;s a grown man .
yep . thanks to my handiwork .
he &apos;s no grown man . he &apos;s just now 18 .
he &apos;s got his prom next month !
i can &apos;t believe it !
i had sex with a teenager !
who am i , woody allen ?
roman polanski ?
pretty much any of your big @-@ time &apos; 70s movie directors ?
you had sex with me innocent child ?
uh , not so innocent .
he made me blush a few times ,
and i have two positions named after me .
well , that &apos;s that .
you &apos;ve seen the last of big booby dirty girl here .
i &apos;d object , but when you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
but ma , i like new york .
people want to take pictures of me willy here .
this is all me fault .
i should have never let you watch that magic mike .
that &apos;s great .
i don &apos;t have a model now .
i &apos;m seal .
但两人在2012年已经离婚
wait until i tell joe about this .
how can you not know how old he is ?
uh ... what can i say ? we &apos;re a typical couple !
he lied about his age , and i pretended he was interesting .
okay , max , when joe gets here ,
i &apos;m just gonna tell her
that me managing an underage twink
has nothing to do with me managing her restaurant
which sells overpriced twink ... ies .
yeah . i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be professional about it all .
professional ?
yesterday , she slapped a woman in here
for wearing cheap heels .
i know . my face is still red .
here she is .
good morning , joe !
hey , ladies .
well , obviously , you &apos;re both fired .
obviously .
can i keep the hat ?
you are not gonna want this back .
my head sweats like a watermelon at a picnic .
please don &apos;t fire us over the nash situation .
it was out of our hands .
actually , it was in her hands ,
and it was only 18 .
you two embarrassed my girlfriend .
and embarrassment in the lesbian community
is worse than not owning a dog .
it &apos;s worse than dating anne heche .
但她后来背叛艾伦 跟艾伦的男摄影师结婚了
oh , my god . we committed a heche crime .
how can we make it better ?
just get that kid back to the photo shoot tomorrow ,
and we &apos;re back in business .
and max , next time ,
stay out of his barely legal business .
done . don &apos;t know how , but done .
you won &apos;t be sorry .
just get him back , &apos; cause i gotta tell ya ...
marie &apos;s crying face ?
not for me .
well , coleslaw ...
just when i thought i was out ,
you pulled me back in again .
max , don &apos;t tell the coleslaw that .
don &apos;t give it that power .
my plan to get nash back will work .
we still have a bright , bright future .
yes ! by day .
han !
do you want to spend another night in this coleslaw bucket ?
no .
and had i not been able to roll myself out to the street ,
i might have suffocated !
nash and his mom will be here any minute , max .
do you really need to expose 60 % of your boobs ?
what ? it &apos;s not up to me .
these girls have a life of their own .
the right one just started a fleetwood mac cover band .
you know how i know ?
&apos;cause when i take my bra off , it goes its own way .
do you really think you can get nash &apos;s mother
to change her mind when they come in
to pick up the rest of his stuff ?
yes , i do .
because she and i have a lot in common .
i may not be irish , but i &apos;m dirt poor ,
and i &apos;m living with someone who drinks way too much .
max , look .
all those purple post @-@ its
are sophie &apos;s friends and family .
my family &apos;s nowhere to be seen !
it &apos;s like i &apos;m looking at the last u.s. census !
hey , girls . come over here .
we need your help with the seating chart .
yeah . you know , planning a wedding is more work
than waxing oleg &apos;s back during a full moon .
sophie , i have my own issue right now .
okay . then max can help me with the chart
while you go worry about your obviously thinning hair .
uh , full disclosure--
the last time someone asked me to help them with something ,
i free @-@ based half their beard off .
i just got a text from nash .
he &apos;s here ? i &apos;ll go get him a kid &apos;s menu .
they &apos;re not coming .
his mom found the racy pictures i sent him .
&quot; flying out of jfk tomorrow .
taking the morning aer lingus &quot; ?
a little morning &quot; aer lingus &quot; ?
isn &apos;t that what got max in trouble in the first place ?
okay , well , we just have to go to the airport
and stop them .
i &apos;ll buy us plane tickets and then return them ,
like i do with shoes or tom cruise does with wives .
jackets and shoes off !
and make sure you check all your pockets .
don &apos;t make me shut this airport down for a piece of gum .
this line is longer than the movie gone girl .
what does tsa stand for ? &quot; time stands a @-@ still ? &quot;
that &apos;s cute . never heard that one before .
most people just go with &quot; this sucks ass . &quot;
max , please don &apos;t yell out again .
people get very jumpy in airports .
oh , what ? it &apos;s not like i screamed , &quot; i have a bomb ! &quot;
miss , will you step over here , please ?
oh , i was kidding . i don &apos;t have a bomb .
but i have been known to ... be da bomb .
max !
please , please , if we step away ,
we &apos;ll lose our place in line .
i know it sounds like we &apos;re here to blow up a plane ,
but we &apos;re really just here to stop an underage kid
she had sex with from leaving the country .
so i should just come over there now .
yep . you just been hand @-@ picked
to join the &quot; i don &apos;t trust you &quot; dance party .
may i see your tickets ?
nice day . i like your hair .
thanks . we &apos;re allowed to be creative
from the neck up .
ooh ! you traveling to paris .
first @-@ class .
in those jeans ?
you got first @-@ class tickets to paris ?
are you insane ?
my fingers did it .
it was rich girl cellular memory .
and if we &apos;re not going anywhere ,
why can &apos;t we not go to paris ?
and why can &apos;t we not go to the louvre ?
and why can &apos;t we not stay in the penthouse
at the george cinq and not order room service ?
is it too late for me to say i don &apos;t know her ?
ma &apos;am , are you carrying any explosives ?
i had leftover chipotle for breakfast .
does that count ?
it does to whoever &apos;s sitting next to you .
air france flight 113
will now begin boarding at gate 24 .
max ! that &apos;s our flight .
air france , flight 113 .
ooh ! i bet on the plane ,
they &apos;ll have caviar and bellinis .
you know what won &apos;t be on the plane ?
us !
we &apos;re not going !
have you been smoking the half joint
i have hidden in my bra ?
you have a joint ?
bank account ? ha !
you went through security with pot ?
i went through third grade with pot .
there he is . there &apos;s nash .
i &apos;m sure his mom is asking
if he can visit the cockpit and meet the pilot .
wow . he &apos;s young .
so young , bruce jenner has been a woman
for most of his life .
于2015年宣布正式变性成为女性
nash ! please .
you can &apos;t go . our entire lives depend on
you finishing that photo shoot .
nash terrence o &apos;brien , you &apos;re not going anywhere .
or i &apos;ll take you over my knee right here .
well , he likes that .
well , you ...
you are just loose as a goose , aren &apos;t ya ?
again ... when you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
max , let me talk to mrs. o &apos;brien .
go up to the gate .
ask what movie they &apos;re showing on their flight .
okay , but if they &apos;re showing anything ,
and i mean anything
from mr. adam sandler ...
i &apos;m getting on the plane too .
please . i &apos;m begging you .
you don &apos;t know me . i &apos;m a proud woman .
the only other time i ever begged
was to get off of p. diddy &apos;s yacht .
i mean , a party shouldn &apos;t be three days long .
miss , you can save your silly breath .
i &apos;m taking him home .
would passenger maeve o &apos;brien please report to the gate desk ?
oh , nash , maybe they &apos;re bumping us up
from the last coach row to the second to the last coach row !
i knew i &apos;d be rewarded for not having any abortions
in spite of me circumstances .
grab nash--let &apos;s get out of here
while i got her distracted .
max , you did that ? how ?
i no longer have the half a joint in my bra .
you bribed an airline employee with a joint ?
pain ? oh , you really gotta stretch out for that .
max , this is kidnapping .
oh , he &apos;s not that young . when i was his age ,
i had already robbed three blockbuster videos .
what &apos;s blockbuster video ?
oh , my god , i screwed a baby .
okay . i &apos;m gonna text joe
and tell her we have nash in our custody .
no , i &apos;d better call .
that text won &apos;t play well at our trial .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell ya i was so young .
but honestly , i didn &apos;t think it mattered
since you &apos;re so immature .
i know you are , but what am i ?
okay , so joe was really impressed with the kidnapping ,
and she gave us our jobs back .
but nash , you &apos;ve been replaced .
they found another model
who wouldn &apos;t give them any parent trouble--
a well @-@ hung orphan .
a well @-@ hung orphan .
well , the lord gives and the lord takes .
so what now ?
well , you go back to ireland and brag to your friends
about having sex with someone who once had sex
with axl rose &apos;s best friend &apos;s son .
good @-@ bye , max .
later , nash potater .
you know , i think i &apos;m gonna miss him .
especially since kids eat free at quiznos before 6 : 00 .
let &apos;s get out of here .
the only good thing about airports
is leaving them for someplace better .
max , next time we &apos;re here ,
i &apos;m gonna take you to paris .
well , first take me to the bathroom .
i &apos;ve had to pee since our tram hit that pothole .
well , at least we &apos;re gonna be working somewhere with class .
i wonder where it is .
joe said it &apos;s a real hub ,
flagship , international .
yeah . it &apos;s gonna be international terminal 8 !
what ?
here ?
we &apos;re working here ?
i &apos;ve got to find out who i brutally murdered
in a previous life and make it up to him or her .
this sucks !
the one place no one will ever give us a ride to work !
final boarding for air france , flight 113 .
of course it is .
look at the bright side .
these days , most planes don &apos;t even make it
to where they &apos;re supposed to go .
paging first @-@ class passengers caroline channing
and max black .
those rich bitches are so lucky !
