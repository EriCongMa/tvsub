you wrote the code in labview ?
do it again in java .
why are you being such a bitch ?
because bitches get things done .
we both know that i &apos;m not smart enough for you ,
and that &apos;s why you won &apos;t date me .
you broke my heart .
is that mariana ?
what the hell is she doing ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m really ready to smoke pot .
the thing is we &apos;re not smoking it .
we &apos;re eating it .
so i looked into kyle &apos;s alibi witness , patrick molloy ,
and it turns out that he was arrested
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor .
i think i might know why the prosecutor didn &apos;t want
kyle &apos;s lawyer to see the forensics report .
it says that the killer was right @-@ handed ,
but kyle &apos;s left @-@ handed .
i have some tax issues with the irs .
are we going to lose our home ?
so ?
so ?
that was ...
pretty terrible .
oh ! yeah .
the worst .
ever .
you know what i was thinking ?
i was thinking maybe we could try again .
you know , see if ...
you can could do better ?
me ?
you started it , woman .
i &apos;m gonna have to show you my &quot; a &quot; game .
it sure was good for your &quot; b &quot; game .
let &apos;s see , i think i have some left @-@ over chinese .

no .
how about pizza ? what are you in the mood for ?
oh , whatever &apos;s easiest .
i got a lot of homework tonight anyway .
i &apos;ll , uh , let aj know we &apos;re home .
uh , yeah ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
uh , i didn &apos;t end up working that extra shift after all , so , uh ...
yeah , i invited brandon to dinner
and , uh , he &apos;s here .
we &apos;re both here . so , uh , if you , uh--

chemistry .
uh , callie , do you want to join us for dinner ?
uh , no , actually , i , um , have to--
i have to be home ...
but thanks .
bye .
bye .
bye .
the only way that we &apos;ll be ready in time for competition
is if the whole robotics team is working 24 / 7 :
before school , during lunch ,
after school , free periods , even nights .
well , is it okay if i schedule in some time to sleep ?
you can sleep when it &apos;s over .
well , look who decided to join us .
sorry , i was doing homework at aj &apos;s ,
and we lost track of time .
okay , family dinner is not an option .
it &apos;s the only time i get to see all of your beautiful faces .
oh yeah ? then why don &apos;t you make brandon come ?
um , brandon was actually at mike &apos;s for dinner .
how nice . maybe if we &apos;re lucky , one of these days
we &apos;ll be graced with his presence too .
mariana , please put your cell phone away
at the dinner table .
well , can i be excused then ?
yes .
no !
what ? we just sat down .
but she &apos;s the first female team leader ,
it &apos;s a big deal .
are there any more potatoes ?
he speaks !
what ? who ?
you and your brother are going to
eat us out of house and home .
uh , speaking of house ,
has anyone heard from gabe lately ?
uh , no , why ?
because he hasn &apos;t been by to work on the garage in days ,
and i &apos;m starting to think he &apos;s blowing us off .
well , he was-- he was here yesterday
when i got home from school .
he was ? doesn &apos;t look like he did much .
well , he &apos;s gonna get it done ! what &apos;s the hurry , anyway ?
hey , watch your tone .
it &apos;s the principle of the matter , jesus .
all right ? we did something for gabe ,
and in exchange he promised to do something for us .
he needs to keep his word .
well , he is . jeez .
hello ?
hey , sorry , did i-- did i wake you ?
no , no , what &apos;s-- what &apos;s up ?
um , yeah , is everything okay ?
i mean , you &apos;ve been kind of mia ,
and my moms are starting to wonder what &apos;s going on .
yeah , sorry .
i , uh , haven &apos;t been feeling that good , so ...
uh , okay .
okay , well , um , look , you-- you got to get back here ,
because they really want to get this remodel finished .
got it . i &apos;ll be there tomorrow ...
for sure .
okay .
the rent on the houses big enough for all of us
is higher than our mortgage .
what about apartments ?
really ? we &apos;re all gonna move into an apartment with no yard ?
you think the kids bicker now ?
when they &apos;re all on top of each other with nowhere to go--
how are you okay with losing our home ,
all the memories that we have here ?
i am not okay . i &apos;m not okay at all ,
but what am i supposed to do ?
let the irs throw my dad in jail ?
that &apos;s a stretch , lena .
that &apos;s not what you told him ,
and what if he does drive himself off a cliff like he said ?
he was being melodramatic .
he &apos;s not gonna kill himself .
all the stress might kill him .
i still say that we should talk to the irs , you know ?
see what other options we have .
and what if they do offer us a payment plan ?
where is that money gonna come from ?
we barely make enough money right now
as it is to pay our bills .
we &apos;ll take on other jobs if we have to .
what about ... asking your mom ?
no , no , absolutely not .
i &apos;m not asking my mother to bail out your father .
that &apos;s not what i--
you &apos;d be asking her to save our home .
i &apos;m not asking my mother for money , lena .
it &apos;s just not gonna happen .
i know that this is heart @-@ breaking ...
for all of us .
but my dad , he needs the money
that we &apos;re gonna get from the sale ,
the money that he--
he gave us in the first place to buy this place .
how can you expect me to save our asses
and then let my parents hang out to dry ?
careful , mason .
okay , mason , no coloring on my sheet music !
okay , you can draw in your coloring books .
that &apos;s it , okay ?
did he ? i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s not a big deal .
no , no , mason !
that &apos;s not a toy ! cort , can you please ?
mason , do what brandon says . okay ?
that &apos;s not yours .
sorry , i &apos;m just going over my work schedule .
i mean , he &apos;s not really hurting it , right ?
no , i guess not . um , i got to go .
oh , don &apos;t forget you &apos;re picking up mason
from preschool this afternoon .
oh , damn . well , i was--
i was hoping i would get some time to practice .
there &apos;s not a lot of time before the audition .
i get it , but i mean if we &apos;re gonna make rent this month ,
i can &apos;t miss work again .
well , maybe eddie can take him ?
well , until this custody thing is settled
i can &apos;t ask eddie to take him when it &apos;s not his turn .
i have to prove that i can handle mason by myself .
detective , really ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for a while .
you ready to leave the beat for the good old boys club ?
it pays more . i &apos;ve got five kids going off to college
sometime soon , hopefully .
those good old boys are just gonna have to get ready
for this good old girl .
so , um , i came home early yesterday .
aj and callie were in his room ,
and , uh , i &apos;m pretty sure they were , uh ...
having sex ?
yeah .
i mean , it &apos;s callie . i thought you should know .
yeah , i appreciate it .
so what ? i should ...
tell aj they can &apos;t be doing that
in my place any more , right ?
i &apos;m not really sure we can make &apos; em stop .
you know , remember what you were like at that age .
no .
well , if they &apos;re gonna be having sex ,
i &apos;d rather them do it some place safe .
you know , not a car or god knows where .
you will have a conversation with him about wearing a condom ?
yeah , of course .
but-- i mean , what ? you &apos;re okay with this ?
uh , i guess .
are you ?
yeah , i guess ,
but , um , brandon was with me .
oh , yeah ?
yeah . i wonder if it was weird for him ?
oh , please , it was a long time ago .
they &apos;re siblings now .
plus , brandon &apos;s living with his girlfriend .
i guess so .
have anything to say about how that &apos;s going ?
well , he seems pretty determined to live with her
until he goes off to juilliard .
if he gets in .
if not , i don &apos;t know how he can afford
to pay rent on an apartment .
wait a minute ? he &apos;s paying the rent ?
and a lot more .
he has no more money left .
what do you mean ? what about the money for the hand settlement ?
he gave it all to her .
what ?
the mailbox is full
and cannot accept any messages at this time . good @-@ bye .
忘了拿体育课的东西
can i help you
or do i need to invest in a &quot; no loitering &quot; sign ?
sorry , um , i , um--
i heard that you could , um , hook me up .
you know , with some , uh ...
green .
you mean pot ?
sure , what kind ?
uh , do you have gummy worms ?
i don &apos;t carry edibles . i meant , &quot; what strain ? &quot;
indica or sativa ?
i , uh , usually go with indigo .
indica ?
right , yeah .
do you want it loose or rolled ?
never mind , rolled .
got it .
every time i finish picking up ,
hurricane mason &apos;s already made another lap
around the apartment .
oh , no need to apologize .
uh , hey , i &apos;m sorry for stopping by .
i didn &apos;t have your number .
oh , that &apos;s fine .
can i get you something to drink ?
no thanks .
i was hoping to talk to you about brandon .
okay .
look , first of all , i just want to say
that i &apos;m supportive of your relationship .
i think you &apos;re a very nice girl
and you clearly care for brandon .
it &apos;s just that , uh ...
all this is a lot of responsibility
at any age , but especially at 18 .
i mean , he hasn &apos;t even graduated high school .
look , i didn &apos;t ask for brandon to move in with me .
i have no doubt that this was his idea .
just like i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t ask him
for the money he gave you .
i didn &apos;t ask for the money .
look , that &apos;s the thing about brandon .
he doesn &apos;t have to be asked .
he sees a pretty girl in need ,
and he feels like he has to save her .
well , i don &apos;t need any saving .
i can take care of myself and my son .
well , i &apos;m sure you can ,
which is why i--
i was hoping you could , uh , encourage him to move back home .
i &apos;m not sure what i could say .
well , i mean ,
you could , uh ...
tell him that it &apos;s confusing for your son
to live with a man that isn &apos;t his father .
you think i &apos;m confusing my son ?
you know , your son &apos;s pretty confused too .
yeah , i agree .
but not about me .
i mean , do you have any idea why he &apos;s living here ?
i mean , i think i do , yeah .
it &apos;s because he &apos;s not comfortable living at home .
why is that ?
because his moms are blaming him
for everything that happened with callie .
they think it &apos;s all his responsibility ,
and he doesn &apos;t want to live with them
looking over his shoulder every day
like he &apos;s some kind of creep .
what do you mean ?
what do you mean , &quot; everything that happened with callie &quot; ?
they had sex !
and the only reason i &apos;m telling you this
is &apos; cause i &apos;m tired of everyone acting like
brandon &apos;s the one being selfish ,
when really he &apos;s just trying to make things easier
for everybody else .
and his moms know ?
yes .
and that &apos;s why
there &apos;s nothing i can say to get him to move home .
你在哪
all right !
我需要你
all right .
访问可能被监视或录像
so-- so did you find molloy ?
we did , um ...
unfortunately , he doesn &apos;t remember that day ,
but he &apos;s not saying that you weren &apos;t at the rec center ,
he just-- you know , it was four years ago .
but the good news is we found something else .
we &apos;ve been going through your lawyer &apos;s files ,
and there was a missing page in the forensics report ,
and it said that the killer most likely was right @-@ handed .
well , i &apos;m left @-@ handed .
i know , so aaron &apos;s gonna
talk to the lawyers at jjc ,
hopefully it &apos;ll be enough for them to take on your case .
you know , if they can prove that this page
was deliberately withheld from your attorney ,
this could be huge .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i spent a lot of time trying to get used to the idea
that i was probably gonna die in prison .
it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve had any hope .
no .
no , no , okay , what were you thinking
running wire on the exterior ?
you &apos;re just asking for it to get cut on the field .
but i-
these kinds of mistakes
are gonna get us slaughtered .
okay .
all right , um ...
here , i &apos;ll do it myself .
someone &apos;s a little tense today .
okay , we don &apos;t have time to keep building
and rebuilding this robot
if we want to be ready for competition in three days .
but you do have time to go visit nick ?
can we not talk about that right now ?
so you &apos;re not stressed about it ?
he &apos;s locked up .
not that locked up if he has access to a phone
and is texting you constantly .
oh , and where have you been ?
i-- i hit my head and ...
whatever !
just help emma mount the shooter .
where is my soldering iron ?
yeah , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s probably just a concussion .
she &apos;s been like this all day .
yeah , welcome to the last 16 years of my life .
what did you do ?
i just got into it with a nail gun .
you should see the other guy-- gun . never mind .
does it hurt ?
yeah , i mean , a little .
you don &apos;t have any aspirin , do you ?
yeah .
so what are you doing with a nail gun ?
um , i was helping gabe out with the garage remodel .
he hasn &apos;t been showing up ,
so my moms are kind of freaking out ,
but can we not tell mariana ?
okay .
do you think he &apos;s blowing the job off ?
no , no , no , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s sick .
no , he wouldn &apos;t do that . he &apos;s a good guy .
well , i think you &apos;re a good guy for helping him .
uh , a good enough guy to , uh ...
have another chance ...
with you ?
i-- i haven &apos;t had time
to think about that .
okay .
hey ! less talky , more worky .
can i have some of those ?
my head is killing me !
yeah , if her head doesn &apos;t kill her ,
i might have to .
hey , what are you doing here ?
well , don &apos;t sound so happy to see me .
sorry , i just , um ...
what &apos;s going on ? is everything okay ?
uh , well ,
i &apos;ve just been thinking a lot about the house .
you know ? um ...
so i asked my mom
if she would help us out .
and ?
well , she doesn &apos;t have the cash ...
but she offered to sell her condo , move in with will .
move into his motor home ?
which-- you know ...
we can &apos;t let her do .
for his sake as much as hers .
well , i , uh-- i made a call
today as well to the irs ,
and , um ...
they said that they would stay the lien on the home
if we could come up with $ 2,000 a month .
okay , so we could work nights and weekends .
seven days a week .
just to never see the kids or each other ...
just to pay for a house that ...
wouldn &apos;t feel like a home &apos; cause we &apos;re never there .
so i guess we &apos;ll call the real estate agent ?
first we need to talk to the kids .
yeah .
okay , mason . so ...
the blanket is an island ...
and the rest of the floor is the ocean .
so you don &apos;t want to fall off the blanket ,
or else you &apos;ll fall in the water and drown .
right ?
wow , drowning ?
is that like a new parenting technique ?
i just-- i really have to practice ,
so unless you want to watch him ?
no , no , looks like you got it covered .
oh , um , thank you for putting my , uh ...
you know , in my backpack yesterday .
yeah .
oh , no , no , no , no . hey , buddy ,
no , no , this isn &apos;t a toy .
all right , go back on the island
or else you &apos;ll get eaten by the sharks .
all right ? stay there .
hey .
what &apos;s up ?
are you stoned ?
uh , a skunk ...
sprayed me .
a stoned skunk .
you &apos;re high .
are you freaking kidding me ?
what is wrong with you , jude ?
upstairs , now !
oh , you need a shower before moms get home and bust your ass .
hurry up !
mason ?
mason !
mason !
no , no , no , no , no . mason !
mason , where are you !
in here !
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever seen that
blue eye shadow on you before .
mariana , could you put that away please ?
sorry , one sec .
i have so much to do on this robot ,
i should really be in the lab right now .
okay , well , this is not gonna take long .
we just want you guys to know first ...
that everything is okay .
we &apos;re gonna be fine .
mason , i would like you to sit down now , please .
good job , buddy .
um , so what &apos;s up then ?
we , uh--
we &apos;re selling the house .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
are you serious ?
we-- what ? why ?
for financial reasons .
what &apos;s going on with you ? are you okay ?
he bumped his head .
how &apos;d you do that ?
i &apos;m fine , it &apos;s nothing . i just-- i have a headache .
ugh , tell me about it !
so we &apos;re losing the only home
that we &apos;ve ever known ? great .
where are we moving to ?
why do you care ?
you don &apos;t even live here any more .
hey , jesus .
hey , i &apos;ve lived here longer than you have !
oh , yeah , and now you &apos;re shacking up with your milf .
jesus , hey !
what ?
&quot; mother i &apos;d like to facebook . &quot;
cut it out now .
wait , are we like broke ?
oh , god , i &apos;m not gonna get into a decent school .
are we gonna be homeless ?
mariana , listen .
grandma and grandpa are going through a rough patch ,
and since they have money invested in this house ,
we-- we need to sell it to pay them back .
we &apos;re gonna be fine , you guys .
okay ? we &apos;re gonna rent until we can buy a new house .
we &apos;re gonna have to live in an apartment ?
mariana , a lot of people live in apartments .
uh @-@ oh . okay , you have got to tell courtney
that she needs to get her son under control .
i can &apos;t tell her how to parent her kid .
someone should . you okay , bud ?
yes .
okay .
we &apos;re gonna go , all right ?
what ?
come on , mason .
where are you going ?
we &apos;re gonna go . say bye , mason .
bye .
bye , buddy .
mason , bye , buddy .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
are we still gonna be able to go to anchor beach ?
of course you will go to anchor beach , honey .
now where are you going ?
i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t feel so good .
jesus ! oh my god !
honey , are you okay ? what &apos;s going on ?
hi , sweetie !
oh , were you a good boy for brandon ?
yeah .
was he ?
yeah .
uh , yeah , yeah .
he was pretty good , except he got into my mom &apos;s makeup .
what ? how did that happen ?
weren &apos;t you watching him ?
well , i was , but it turns out
playing chopin &apos;s etude number 10
while watching a toddler is harder than you think .
great , like your moms need another reason to hate me .
they don &apos;t hate you .
mason , damm it !
no , no , no , no !
how many times do i have to have to tell you ?
hands off the keyboard !
this is not a toy !
okay , brandon , it was an accident .
no , he needs a time out , cort !
hey , don &apos;t yell at my son !
it &apos;s not your place to discipline him !
well , somebody needs to .
i discipline him .
no , you don &apos;t ! you let him run wild !
you don &apos;t set any boundaries !
okay , that &apos;s why he &apos;s in our bed every night ,
and that &apos;s why he ruins our stuff .
he &apos;s out of control !
great .
it &apos;s good to know what you think of me as a mother .
cort .
it &apos;s time for bed .
what &apos;s taking so long ?
i don &apos;t know .
do you think he &apos;s gonna be okay ?
i mean , he &apos;s gonna be okay , right ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing serious .
he probably just forgot to eat lunch or something .
are you all right ?
just , i still have this freaking headache .
maybe it &apos;s empathy pain .
you know , like twin @-@ tuition .
what ? it &apos;s a thing .
no , it &apos;s not that .
i took some of jesus &apos;s adhd pills .
why ?
to stay up , to stay focused .
that &apos;s like taking speed . are you crazy ?
i &apos;m just so stressed out about the competition .
you don &apos;t need to take pills .
you &apos;re brilliant , okay ?
and we &apos;ve got this .
and the whole point of the competition
is to have fun and to learn something ,
not ... to be an idiot .
i know .
promise me you won &apos;t take any more .
i won &apos;t . i promise .
it was stupid .
hey , is he okay ? what happened ?
we &apos;re not sure . apparently he hit his head
earlier in the afternoon ,
and then just collapsed after you left .
they just took him for a cat @-@ scan .
we &apos;re just waiting to hear .
mrs. foster ?
did you find anything ?
we did .
something pretty surprising .
what is that ?
that &apos;s a ...
nail .
as you can see ,
it &apos;s embedded several inches into his frontal lobe .
oh my god .
what ?
first of all , it &apos;s not life @-@ threatening ,
and we &apos;re lucky it didn &apos;t reach his motor cortex .
so he &apos;s gonna be okay ?
there is a slight chance this could affect his speech center .
we won &apos;t know until we remove it .
how-- how did this happen ?
well , has he been using a nail gun ?
n-- has he ?
no , not on the robot .
um , he told me that he was working on your garage ,
and that the gun recoiled and hit him in the head .
what was he doing working on the garage ?
i think he was , um ,
covering for his birth father .
why-- why wouldn &apos;t he say something ?
the skull has pain @-@ sensitive nerves ,
but there aren &apos;t any within the brain itself ,
so he probably didn &apos;t realize
he did anything more than nick himself .
okay , is he awake ?
is he aware of what &apos;s happening ?
we have him sedated and we &apos;re prepping him for surgery ,
and dr. wong , our top neurosurgeon , is on her way ,
so your son will be in the best hands possible .
can we see him ?
uh , yes , but just the moms for now .
it &apos;s going to be okay .
okay , don &apos;t worry .
jesus &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
hey , ana called me about jesus .
what happened ? is he all right ?
no , he &apos;s not .
he shot himself in the head with your nail gun .
what ?
he &apos;s got a nail in his head
because you didn &apos;t show up to do your job .
look , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve been sick . i didn &apos;t--
just go ...
before my moms see you .
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m really sorry .
yeah , well , if he &apos;s not okay , it &apos;s on you .
so is this something you do now ?
you get high ?
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
fine , you can talk to moms .
all right , fine .
it &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve smoked it ,
but ... i ate some gummy worms before--
well , like , edibles .
where &apos;d you get them ?
i &apos;m not kidding . i &apos;ll tell them .
all right ! god !
noah has a medical marijuana card .
don &apos;t lie to me , jude .
i swear . his mom got it for him for anxiety .
what kind of mom gives their 15 @-@ year @-@ old kid pot ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s any worse than giving him a bunch of pills .
oh my god .
look , people use it for attention problems ,
like jesus .
you don &apos;t judge him for taking his meds , do you ?
no , that is--
at least weed is natural .
okay , well , let &apos;s be real .
people use it sometimes as an excuse to get high .
well , it helped me .
i was a little anxious before my test the other day ,
so i took some .
and guess what ? i got an &quot; a. &quot;
seriously , you &apos;re getting high at school ?
don &apos;t be an idiot , jude !
look , if i find out that you &apos;ve done it again ,
i will go straight to moms , and i &apos;m not kidding .
hey , any word yet ?
no , he &apos;s still in surgery .
thanks for coming , mike .
yeah , of course .
you get a chance to talk to cortney ?
uh , yeah .
well , what &apos;d she have to say ?
uh , let &apos;s talk about it later .
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s aaron .
should i be worried about this guy ?
no , we &apos;re texting about kyle .
the jjc &apos;s not taking his case .
what about the report that said the killer was right @-@ handed ?
they said it &apos;s not enough .
he just can &apos;t catch a break .
you know , and what &apos;s so unfair is that he has an alibi witness
who would get him out if he just told the truth .
i love how much you care about people , callie ,
but maybe this time , you ought to just--
what ? give up ?
no , and let kyle go to a maximum @-@ security prison ,
where he &apos;ll be beaten and raped
and treated like a piece of garbage for the rest of his life ?
i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
no , i know .
um , i &apos;m gonna use the restroom , okay ?
hey , so , uh , i &apos;ve been thinking .
i &apos;m not really comfortable with you and callie
being intimate under my roof .
oh , well , okay .
&apos;kay .
callie !
hey .
noah , hey .
how &apos;s jesus ?
still in surgery .
oh , and this is my mom . nicole .
i &apos;m one of the volunteer chaplains at the hospital ,
so we just wanted to come by and see
if there &apos;s anything we can do for you and your family .
yeah , there is .
um , look , it &apos;s your business
if you want to buy pot for your son ,
but i don &apos;t want him giving any more of it to my brother .
did you ?
just once .
i &apos;m sorry .
maybe it is better if we just go .
maybe it is , yeah .
hey .
my love , how you doing ?
jueves cheeseburger , para hermana y ...
private taco .
what , baby ?
psych !
what ? come on .
jesus , stop .
jesus .
well , that &apos;s too bad ,
you know , because it would &apos;ve been nice to live in a world
without your awful jokes .
ha . hey , it &apos;s a good look for you .
so they went up your nose and into your brain ?
meh , it probably wasn &apos;t too hard .
there &apos;s a lot of extra space up there .
are you in pain ?
no , no , it &apos;s not bad .
mm @-@ hmm , well , by the way ,
you are banned from using power tools
for the rest of your natural life .
oh , and you totally don &apos;t deserve to here this ,
but emma told me to tell you
quote , &quot; she &apos;s done thinking about it ,
and the answer is &apos; yes . &apos; &quot;
i don &apos;t think i want to know .
so the realtor wants to talk about the listing price .
are you seriously on your phone right now ?
you told noah &apos;s mom what we did ?
no , i told noah not to give you any more gummy worms
and his mother happened to be there .
after all the stupid stuff that you &apos;ve done
and i &apos;ve never told anybody ,
you go and tattle on me ?
you know what ? i &apos;m never gonna tell you anything again .
so just stay out of my life ... for good .
hey , everybody , come here , come here .
i know that we &apos;re all upset about the house ...
but it doesn &apos;t matter where we live .
home is-- it &apos;s just where we &apos;re all together .
yes ?
you kind of sound like a greeting card .
what are you doing ?
my job .
your job is gonna be someone who can keep his commitments ,
not put my son in harms way .
look , i feel terrible jesus got hurt .
okay , but you have to know
that i did not ask him to come in here
and work for me . i would never do that .
it doesn &apos;t change the fact that he did
because you weren &apos;t here , gabe .
i don &apos;t mean to keep letting him down , and ...
i am appreciative
of everything you &apos;ve done for me .
it certainly doesn &apos;t seem that way ,
the way you &apos;ve been acting .
what do you want ? i &apos;m struggling here .
with what ? what is wrong with you ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i-- i don &apos;t know what the problem is .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with me .
have you really been sick , gabe ?
really ?
i just--
i &apos;m really having a hard time , you know ...
even getting out of bed in the morning .
sounds like depression to me , don &apos;t you think ?
yeah , i guess , but it &apos;s not your problem .
look , peace , okay ?
can we just-- just talk to me .
it &apos;s stupid for men to feel this way .
if you don &apos;t do anything about it
because you think it &apos;s stupid , it &apos;s never gonna get better , is it ?
i thought ...
that when i got off that list that everything would be normal .
but all i can think about is how much of my life
was wasted ...
and how i &apos;m never gonna get any of that time back .
yeah , you won &apos;t , that sucks .
now the only thing you can do is get help ,
make sure that you don &apos;t lose any more .
i really ...
need to finish this .
okay .
thank you .
how are you ?
good .
excuse me , mr. molloy .
sorry to bother you again .
i already told you , okay ? i don &apos;t remember .
look , i know that &apos;s not true .
i know that you remember that kyle was at the rec center
the day that mrs. johnson was killed
because you talked to his lawyer .
look , uh , it was four years ago .
right , i don &apos;t remember what i had for breakfast today ,
so-- what can i get you ?
look , an innocent 17 @-@ year @-@ old kid
is gonna spend the rest of his life in prison
if you don &apos;t tell the truth .
you need to leave me alone .
okay ? i &apos;ve got work to do .
my mom &apos;s a cop .
we know that you were arrested right before kyle &apos;s trial ...
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor !
you need to get the hell out of here .
and we know you made a deal .
i said get the hell away from me , bitch !
hey ! do not touch me !
what is going on ?
are you the manager ?
yes !
okay , you should know that you &apos;re employing a child molester !
i don &apos;t know who this crazy bitch is .
she just came up to me , started screaming .
right , you need to leave .
how can you live with yourself ?
no , seriously , how ?
do i need to call the cops ?
no , i &apos;m going .
you should know this isn &apos;t over .
why don &apos;t you take your break ?
hey , it &apos;s molloy again .
that girl i told you about , she came back ,
and she knows about the deal we made .
how ?
i don &apos;t know .
she says her mom &apos;s a cop .
what the hell is going on ?
beats me .
what &apos;s her name again ?
callie adams @-@ foster .
alright , i &apos;ll handle it .
i &apos;d love the opportunity to be your realtor .
