did she know you killed your wife ?
secrets were uncovered .
honey , i &apos;m home .
carlos came back .
whatever you want to do , i &apos;m in your corner .
lynette made a promise .
mr. faladi .
i love him and he loves me !
and bree &apos;s daughter fell for her history teacher .
while mike &apos;s history ...
he &apos;s suffered significant memory loss .
... was being carefully rewritten .
susan mayer .
we were close ? huh
that tramp treated you like dirt .
the art of sabotage .
it &apos;s practiced every day in the suburbs .
sometimes it takes the form of a bundt cake ,
offered to a friend who &apos;s on a diet .
other times it &apos;s a cable ,
cut just as the husband &apos;s friends arrive
to watch the big game .
and there &apos;s always that anonymous phone call
to the city zoning department .
yes , in suburbia everyone you meet
is a potential saboteur .
absolutely everyone .
good afternoon . i &apos;m , uh , bree hodge . and you are ?
name &apos;s gus and we &apos;re all booked up .
actually , gus , i &apos;m here to see one of your guests .
a gentleman named faladi .
he came in about an hour ago .
you want me to call him for you ?
no , no . i &apos;d like you to take me to his room
and unlock it so i can walk in unannounced .
you can &apos;t do that .
besides , he has a girl in there .
yes , i know . she &apos;s my daughter .
my 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
yeah . that would be , uh , room 17 .
wow . there &apos;s irony for you .
you don &apos;t have a gun in there , do you ?
because i just put down new carpet .
gus , i don &apos;t plan anything unpleasant .
i &apos;m simply going to inform mr. faladi
what repercussions he faces
if he continues this relationship ,
and trust him to see reason .
what the hell ?
mom . what are you doing here ?
how could you do this to me ?
what makes you think ... ?
yes , the art of sabotage .
it &apos;s practiced every day in the suburbs .
i told you , it &apos;s over .
didn &apos;t you hear her ?
so how did it go ?
quite well , i think .
but few do it as well as bree hodge .
oh , and gus ?
the carpet is beautiful .
or as politely .
family dinner .
there was a time when that phrase
meant something on wisteria lane .
of course , this was back
when meals were lovingly prepared
by wives who loved to cook .
for children who remembered their manners .
but family dinners , like the times ,
had changed .
and there was only one house in the neighborhood
where dinner remained a family occasion .
and attendance was not optional .
i don &apos;t know when i &apos;ve tasted such tender spring lamb .
thank you , dear .
danielle , you haven &apos;t touched your dinner .
she doesn &apos;t like spring lamb . she prefers old goat .
i &apos;m glad you guys think
it &apos;s so funny that my life is over .
your mother was right to end that .
the man was your teacher and married .
he &apos;s getting a divorce .
that hardly bolsters his suitability .
danielle , please eat something .
don &apos;t worry , dear .
hunger strikes demand self @-@ control .
we &apos;ve seen that hardly her strong suit .
when are you gonna take me seriously ?
when you start acting like an adult .
she sleeps with them . that &apos;s a start .
i hate you ! i hate all of you !
remind me to buy paper plates .
we &apos;ll need them
till a certain someone can be trusted with china again .
wow . you &apos;re pretty good at that .
hey . you are home early . hi .
yes , i am .
what is all this ?
we are having a celebration .
sit .
what are we celebrating ?
you being the greatest wife in the world .
thanks .
no , seriously , though .
i mean it .
how many wives would tell their husbands
to follow his dreams
and then have the patience to wait
while he figures out what the hell it is ?
oh , my god . you know what you want to do .
that &apos;s fantastic .
what is it ?
wait for it . wait for it .
i knew i needed to spend my days
doing something i was passionate about .
something creative . yeah , have at it .
something where i interacted with the public ,
but was my own boss .
and then , this morning , it just ... bam , it hit me .
ok . ok , i &apos;m dying here .
what &apos;s the dream ?
you &apos;re eating it .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m gonna open up a pizza parlor !
i bet you didn &apos;t see that coming .
no .
that was a real frisbee to the head , that one .
but , but when you think about it ,
doesn &apos;t it make perfect sense ?
i mean , marinara &apos;s in my blood .
my uncle vito came here with nothing .
he turned that trattoria into a gold mine .
isn &apos;t he the one that asked us for a loan last christmas ?
he has a gambling problem , but don &apos;t blame the pizza .
trust me . i &apos;ve got it all mapped out .
it &apos;s gonna have a real family feel .
with big portions , but small prices .
crayons for the kids .
god , i feel good about this .
so what do you think ?
i think ... i &apos;m gonna open another bottle of wine .
but we haven &apos;t finished this one .
well , hey , we &apos;re celebrating , right ?
carlos , what are you doing in my room ?
oh , hey , gabby . you &apos;re home early .
god , carlos . strawberries and champagne ?
did you think you were gonna seduce me ?
never entered my mind .
right . right .
i may be living with you until the divorce is final ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean
i have to put up with your cheesy come @-@ ons .
gabby , can i just say one thing ?
what ?
you &apos;ve been thinking and you realize i &apos;m your soul mate ,
and there &apos;s a vacancy in your heart only i can fill ?
gabby , listen .
it &apos;s over between us . just move on .
forget me .
as i was trying to say , i have company over .
this is trishelle .
trishelle , this is ...
what was your name , again ?
i seem to have forgotten .
the doctor said
i should use as many things as i can to jog your memory .
and not just pictures .
he said i could use tastes and smells and sounds .
so tonight is sounds of the seventies .
ok . well , let me set the scene .
we were at this funky little fish joint
you &apos;d been dying to take me to , cappy &apos;s .
do you remember cappy &apos;s ?
ok . well , we were there .
and , uh , we were just wolfing down
the most delicious trout ever .
how long till the music part ?
oh , it &apos;s coming .
and this seventies cover band they started to play .
and that &apos;s how we got our song .
our song was car wash ?
yes ! see how much fun we were ?
so , i dragged you out on to the dance floor ,
and you were giving me this look .
like the look you &apos;re giving me now .
and i started to do this .
and then you did this .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry . this isn &apos;t working .
oh , mike , you &apos;re not even trying to remember .
it was fun !
i know . ok . sing with me .
car wash . talkin &apos; about the car wash . car wash , yeah
you know , i &apos;m really beat .
ok , mike , i am not doing this to upset you .
i &apos;m doing this to help .
i get that .
it &apos;s just ...
the music is giving me a headache .
ok , well , i &apos;ll go .
but i am not giving up on you .
you are going to remember the night
that we danced to car wash .
not just because it was fun , but because
later that night we did some things that ,
trust me , are worth remembering .
that jane doe from the golf course ...
i think i missed something at the autopsy .
check it out .
you &apos;ve always got to come at lunch , don &apos;t you ?
those blue marks on the back of her hand .
at first i thought they were veins .
now i think it &apos;s ink .
you mean like some kind of writing ?
yeah .
i need to run some more tests
and see if i can get a clearer image .
i could be wrong , but ...
but what ?
i think it &apos;s a phone number .
the oddest thing happened at the club today .
tish atherton ...
andrew , would you be a dear
and make sure your sister &apos;s just breaking her own things ?
anyway , tish atherton ...
danielle ?
yeah . i &apos;ll tell them .
i &apos;m telling you , it was a deliberate snub .
i waved to her and she looked right through me .
true , i never bought her eldest daughter a gi ...
mom ?
please don &apos;t interrupt me while i &apos;m speaking .
true , i never bought her eldest daughter a gift ,
but you know my policy .
no husband , no baby gift .
now what is it , dear ?
um ... danielle &apos;s upstairs trying to commit suicide .
there &apos;s no rush . she &apos;s not trying that hard .
how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game ?
your sister tried to kill herself . that doesn &apos;t upset you ?
she tried to slit her wrists with a spoon .
how upset do you want me to be ?
mrs. hodge ?
is my daughter all right ?
she &apos;s groggy , but she &apos;ll be fine .
the wounds are fairly superficial .
so dose the patient .
we &apos;ll release her tonight .
but you understand in cases like this ,
counseling is mandatory .
of course . we &apos;ll get her all the help she needs .
she &apos;s resisting our efforts to pump her stomach .
she says she only took three sedatives .
she &apos;s disoriented .
pump her .
andrew !
pump her .
they &apos;re sticking a tube down her throat !
do you still think this is funny ?
mom , this was a half @-@ ass bid for attention .
this was a cry for help .
if we don &apos;t listen ,
next time she could do something more dangerous .
yeah . next time she might jump off the porch .
would you stop it !
suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family !
i will not have it made light of !
orson &apos;s right .
we need to support each other as a family .
in fact , i say we all go for counseling .
did tom actually say he &apos;s opening up a pizza parlor ?
lynette , you &apos;re not serious .
might as well stand in tomato sauce
and tear up hundred dollar bills .
i know , but i said i &apos;d support him
and help him follow his dream .
he can &apos;t hold you to that .
not if the dream is pizza .
she promised to stand by him .
once you make that commitment ,
you have to see it through .
yeah .
how &apos;s that divorce going ?
i &apos;m done talking .
hey , parker , be careful up there .
i just keep thinking he &apos;s gonna come to his senses
and realize it &apos;s a bad idea .
that &apos;s never gonna happen .
why ?
men are genetically incapable of realizing
that their dreams are stupid .
care to elaborate , dr. mccluskey ?
my husband sold insurance for 36 years .
one day he woke up and decided
he wanted to move to paris and paint naked ladies .
i told him , &quot; you can barely paint the garage .
what makes you think you can commit art ? &quot;
and for the rest of his life he despised me .
he despised you for saying no ?
well , he also thought i was sleeping with his brother .
i &apos;m sure that was mixed in there , too .
ok , so i got kayla all unpacked .
oh , great . so tom will drop her off at your house on friday .
sounds good . lynette , can i talk to you for a second ?
pardon me for having really big ears .
but i heard about tom and this pizza place .
do you want to know what i think ?
no , not really .
it sucks . it &apos;s a sucky idea .
and your friends back there ,
they &apos;re too nice to come out and say it .
luckily , i &apos;m not your friend .
so you can trust me .
nip it in the bud .
and make tom resent me for the rest of his life ?
i don &apos;t think so .
you better do something .
&apos;cause if you don &apos;t ,
you and me will wind up working a pole to pay for braces .
hi , julie . i bought you some flowers .
generally , when you buy flowers
they don &apos;t still have the roots on them .
ok , i was hoping you
could help me with my english lit paper .
hi . i &apos;m sarah .
hey . so what do you say ?
actually , i &apos;m sort of busy right now .
oh , come on .
aunt edie &apos;s gonna give me the boot
if i flunk out .
wouldn &apos;t you miss me ?
absolutely .
whose motorcycle would wake us all up at 2 : 00 a.m. ?
you drive a motorcycle ?
please . look , i could really use some help here .
normally , i charge $ 12 an hour for tutoring .
but seeing as it &apos;s you , $ 15 .
great . see you friday .
oh , just so you know , i charge $ 15 an hour to make out .
so i &apos;ll probably break even .
hi . you &apos;re new . where &apos;s marcy ?
she &apos;s in honolulu on vacation . can i help you ?
i &apos;m just going to see mike delfino .
what &apos;s that smell ?
my macaroni and cheese .
i was hoping it &apos;d trigger mike &apos;s memory .
i made it the first time we met two years ago .
you should have refrigerated it .
edie ?
oh , you know miss britt ?
uh , yeah . what is she doing here ?
visiting mr. delfino .
you know she was with him when he came out of his coma ?
what ?
and she &apos;s been here every day since .
you !
hello , susan . long time no see .
i was wondering why mike &apos;s been cold to me .
now it makes sense .
i &apos;m sure i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
for god sakes , take a bath .
that &apos;s my mac and cheese .
don &apos;t change the subject .
what have you been telling him about me ?
why would i say anything about you ?
mike has no idea who you are .
i envy him .
ladies , is there a problem ?
i want this woman banned from the hospital .
she &apos;s been like this ever since mike dumped her .
imagine fatal attraction with a much older woman .
ma &apos;am , mr. delfino already has a visitor .
i think you should go .
me ? why doesn &apos;t she leave ?
i &apos;ve been here every day for the last six months .
well , i don &apos;t know you , but i do know his girlfriend .
girlfriend ! ok , you know what ?
i want marcy &apos;s number in honolulu
and i want it right now !
you need to leave .
you &apos;re disturbing the patients .
what are you ... oh , this is ridiculous !
i mean , who am i disturbing ? it &apos;s a coma ward .
don &apos;t you want them to wake up ?
i did not call you that .
yes , you did !
i have never in my life used the word retard .
is what you think .
you think i &apos;m this immature moron
who can &apos;t be trusted to decide what &apos;s best for her .
well , you did try to off yourself .
i think you don &apos;t get to pull the
&quot; i know what &apos;s best for me &quot; card .
andrew , not in front of the therapist .
actually , i think we &apos;re making great progress .
you feel danielle refuses to see
you &apos;re acting in her best interest .
and you think your mother cares more about her image
than your feelings .
danielle ,
how can you think i don &apos;t care about your feelings ?
don &apos;t you know how much your mother loves you ?
when i saw you in that tub ,
it was the worst moment of my life .
the thought of losing you is more than i can bear .
how does that make you feel ?
actually , kind of powerful .
powerful ?
you really don &apos;t want to lose me ?
of course not .
i already went through thinking i &apos;d lost andrew .
i can &apos;t do that again .
well then , here &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
i &apos;m going to start dating robert again .
and if you try to break us up ,
or get him fired , then i &apos;m going to leave
and you will never see me again .
danielle .
if that can survive on the zone , so can i.
you don &apos;t believe me ?
call my bluff . see what happens .
so , what do we owe you for all this progress ?
come on , austin , concentrate .
ok , why did iago betray othello ?
because the play would suck if he didn &apos;t ?
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
sorry .
no , no , no , no . we &apos;re here to work .
and if my mom came home she &apos;d flip .
now , put that away .
you said put it away .
look , if you think i &apos;m gonna sit here and write your paper
for you while you get drunk ...
just help me get it started .
this is hard for me .
i didn &apos;t read shakespeare in juvie .
i majored in not getting stabbed .
fine . i &apos;ll write your intro ,
but then you &apos;re on your own .
thank you very much .
so ... why &apos;d they send you to juvie , anyway ?
they didn &apos;t . my mom did .
why ?
she had this boyfriend . no job , big drunk .
a real catch .
one night he pops her one .
so i break a chair on his head .
and she calls the cops . on me !
but you were protecting her .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the guy said he &apos;d leave
if she didn &apos;t press charges .
well , my mom doesn &apos;t really like to be alone .
you know what ?
you &apos;re tired .
um , why don &apos;t you lay down for a couple minutes
and i &apos;ll just do a page or two .
you &apos;re a rock star , mayer .
carlos . no trishelle tonight ?
ah ... no .
about her ... i have a confession to make .
does her pimp want the money ?
you know , there is some cash in my purse .
look , i know i crossed a line bringing her here ,
but i was trying to make you jealous .
like the way you made me feel
when you said you slept with john rowland again .
i think it &apos;s more than that .
i think you really hate me .
that &apos;s not true .
oh , i think it is .
you know , introducing your spouse
to someone you &apos;re about to have sex with .
there &apos;s only one reason to do that .
pure hatred .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , i think i do .
phil , come meet my basically ex @-@ husband .
thank you . carlos .
carlos , this is my new friend , phil lopez .
we &apos;ve met , gabby .
really ?
well , that &apos;s weird . when ?
fairview chamber of commerce , the annual dinner .
oh , my god , that &apos;s right . that &apos;s right !
you were up for the latino businessman of the year award
that phil won .
well , actually , i beat him out twice .
no !
oh , i remember . carlos was so annoyed .
what did you say , hon ?
&quot; he may have that trophy , but i &apos;ve got you . &quot;
ain &apos;t life funny ?
gabby , can we talk for a sec ?
not now .
phil and i are getting in the hot tub .
phil , did you bring your suit ?
you said i didn &apos;t have to .
not in front of carlos @-@ cay .
go outside . i &apos;ll meet you there .
phil lopez ? you brought home phil lopez ?
i had no idea you hated me that much .
well , now you know .
hey , good news . my realtor found me some sweet locations .
that &apos;s great .
hey , could we talk about this restaurant thing for a second ?
yeah , what &apos;s up ?
i don &apos;t know if you noticed ,
but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept ,
i was a wee bit skeptical .
yeah , i sensed that .
of course . you &apos;re a smart guy .
which is also why you &apos;re gonna jump on the idea
i have to make the whole thing work .
ok , so , you &apos;re not bailing on me ?
no .
no , no , no . i am totally on board .
oh , good .
you had me scared there for a second . ok .
so , well , what is this great idea ?
i &apos;m thinking , catering company .
start small , have an italian theme ,
create some cash flow and then ,
later on , expand into the pizza thing .
but that &apos;s not my dream .
well , think about it .
you &apos;re gonna do all these fun parties .
people will start talking .
&quot; this is great food .
this guy should open a restaurant .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;d eat there . &quot; and then , wham .
five short years later you have a built @-@ in customer base .
but i said , it &apos;s not my dream . pizza is my dream .
i know , i know . catering &apos;s how you get there .
so , why can &apos;t i skip catering
and go straight to pizza ?
because you &apos;ll fail .
i &apos;m sorry . god . i shouldn &apos;t have said that .
but you &apos;re gambling with our life savings ,
and you have no experience .
you said you &apos;d support me .
i &apos;m trying to . i am trying to .
but are you aware that
90 percent of restaurants tank in their first year ?
ten percent of them make it .
why don &apos;t you ever think i &apos;d be one of them ?
no . no ! do me a favor .
don &apos;t answer that .
carlos !
i &apos;m making a snack for phil .
do you want something to eat ?
some sour grapes , perhaps ? maybe a little crow ?
ok . we need to move this over there .
why ?
uh ... feng shui .
i don &apos;t know . don &apos;t just stand there . help me .
hey , don &apos;t start without me .
no , let &apos;s get something straight .
you and i are not gonna have sex tonight .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry . no offense . you &apos;re a nice guy .
i &apos;m just not into you that way .
oh , god , phil .
give it to me .
ok .
i &apos;m not talking to you . back off .
but i thought ... i mean , in the hot tub , we were ...
yes. you saw my boobs .
you gonna have that mental snapshot to use
as you as wish for the rest of your life .
that is all you &apos;re getting !
wait , wait . so you &apos;re just using me ?
unbelievable .
i am what ?
you &apos;re unbelievable !
really ?
so are you , big boy .
no wonder you &apos;re divorcing her . she &apos;s a straight @-@ up loon .
crap . she &apos;s blocking my car .
i &apos;m always happy to help a brother out .
hold on .
oh , ride &apos; em , cowboy .
take me home , philly .
you should wear a saddle .
stop it , phil .
i told you to beat it . no means no .
i need your car keys .
you &apos;re blocking the stallion &apos;s hatchback .
oh , yes . yes , phil .
fill me with phil !
i never said that .
and you moved the bed .
what were you thinking ?
shut up .
if you &apos;re trying to hurt me ,
that &apos;s not the way to do it .
well , then , enlighten me .
how can i hit you so hard that you will never recover ?
you can &apos;t .
no , i have to , carlos .
i need you to give up on us .
we &apos;re not good for each other ,
and i can &apos;t keep doing this .
but i can . you proved something tonight .
you had a rich , good @-@ iooking guy in your bed
and you couldn &apos;t pull the trigger .
that means you still care .
and as long as i know that ,
i can take anything that you can dish out .
you know what ? i &apos;m tired .
can we talk about this in the morning ?
sure .
but you &apos;re bringing me breakfast in bed
or no deal .
it &apos;s a date .
sarah ? what are you ... ?
julie , thank god it &apos;s you .
we thought you were the cops .
oh , hey , julie . what are you , on buzz kill patrol tonight ?
this is why you couldn &apos;t go to the movies with me ?
sorry . i thought you weren &apos;t that into him .
you know , if you are ...
i &apos;m not !
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m mad that you blew me off .
well , i &apos;d totally understand
if you wanted to blow me off for a date .
you call this a date ? getting mauled in a car ?
hey , you want to talk about this later ?
i &apos;m losing altitude here .
you are disgusting . enjoy the rest of your date .
julie , there you are .
i think i found a way to get through to mike .
let it go . he &apos;s not into you .
gabby , rise and shine . i made you some waffles .
i got a second wind last night , so i went to a bar .
that &apos;s where i met jason . we spent the whole night ...
how did you put it ? pulling the trigger .
so did i hurt you , or should i keep trying ?
you kicked ass in rehab today .
yeah , i raised my arm over my head .
sign me up for the olympics .
oh , be patient .
it takes time .
miss britt , phone call for you at the nurses &apos; station .
for me ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
there &apos;s a phone call for me ?
susan ? what are you ... ?
shh . i thought you could use some fresh air .
hello ?
hello ? it &apos;s edie .
what the hell is this ? who &apos;s he ?
this is hank
he has very kindly offered to take us on a field trip .
for 60 bucks an hour .
where are you taking me ?
a little jaunt down memory lane .
oh , god .
you &apos;re not taking me to that fish and disco place , are you ?
no , no . what we &apos;re doing today is more low @-@ key .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;re totally safe .
we &apos;re not doing anything wrong .
punch it !
hello .
look , mrs. hodge ,
i &apos;ve only seen your daughter once since the motel .
she &apos;d told me you &apos;d backed off .
mf faladi , i &apos;m not here to threaten you .
i &apos;ve come to give you my blessing .
your blessing ?
yes , danielle made it clear
that i &apos;m powerless to stop this relationship .
since she assures me that you love her ...
you do love her , don &apos;t you ?
yes , of course .
good . then we &apos;re all set .
here &apos;s some of her clothes .
i &apos;ll bring her cds and her stuffed animals over tomorrow .
you want her to stay here ?
this place is kind of small .
well , that hotel room was small
and you seemed happy enough there .
and i trust you to be discreet .
you wouldn &apos;t want your wife to find out
and use it against you in your divorce .
whoa , whoa , mrs. hodge ?
things are getting a little bit complicated .
could you please tell danielle
that this is not gonna work out ?
mr. faladi , if you want to break my daughter &apos;s heart ,
i can &apos;t stop you .
but i will not be an accomplice .
you &apos;ll tell her yourself .
right .
don &apos;t even think about blaming me .
if you so much as mention that we spoke ,
i &apos;ll phone the police .
fine , i will leave you out of it .
oh , and one more thing .
yes ?
danielle is applying to colleges . i do hope
she can count on you for a glowing recommendation .
sure .
when i locked myself out of the house ,
that &apos;s the bush that you found me in .
naked . surely , you remember that ?
nope .
ouch . that hurts .
ok , remember the spot ?
this is where we sat in your truck
and had our first kiss .
were you naked then , too ?
mike , why are you being this way ?
this is pointless .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t remember being with you .
ok , i know it &apos;s hard ,
but you &apos;ve got to make an effort .
if your head is foggy don &apos;t look there .
look in your heart . because i &apos;m in there .
just like you &apos;re inside mine .
ok . this is mary alice &apos;s house .
this is where we first met .
i was setting out my macaroni and cheese .

it &apos;s over .

that maybe mike and i are meant to end up together ?
no ! mike ... you don &apos;t even want him .
you &apos;re just doing this to hurt me .

since the day he moved in here .
i even backed off when he fell
for your miss adorable act .
but he &apos;s over that . it &apos;s my turn now .
and i will be better for him than you ever were .
and if you do get hurt , well , that &apos;s just gravy .
all right . maybe that was a little evil .

sorry it took so long .
that last digit was barely legible .
i thought you &apos;d like to do the honors .
you &apos;ve reached mike delfino plumbing .
please leave a message after the beep .
a d minus .
that blows .
yeah , it does .
since it &apos;s not the one we did together .
you e @-@ mailed me the wrong paper .
you didn &apos;t even read it before you turned it in ?
i didn &apos;t think i had to .
the one you wrote was great .
after you left
i decided i really should put it in your words .
is this some weird chick thing you did
&apos;cause you &apos;re into me ?
oh , please .
no , it is .
you &apos;re pissed &apos; cause i hooked up with your friend .

iago betrayed othello because he was jealous .
danielle , i thought you &apos;d be with mr. faladi tonight .
you &apos;ll be happy to know he dumped me .
he dumped you ?
said it was getting too messy ,
that i was gonna complicate his divorce .
don &apos;t pretend you &apos;re sorry .
i don &apos;t plan to .
i hope this doesn &apos;t make history class awkward .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
i went to the principal and got his ass fired .
when he called to yell at me for squealing ,
i recorded the call and sent a tape of it to his wife .
thanks to me he &apos;ll be getting nothing in this divorce .
i must say , that was rather underhanded .
yes . i wonder where she gets it .
bye , daddy .
bye . i &apos;ll see you guys on friday .
kayla said that you &apos;re opening a pizza place ?
well , maybe . i mean , it &apos;s not a done deal yet .
lynette put the kibosh on it , huh ?
what makes you say that ?
well , you know . lynette .
she &apos;s probably right .
there &apos;s a bunch of dumb schmucks
trying to open restaurants . so ...
you know , tom , i &apos;ve tasted your pizza .
and i have to be perfectly honest with you .
it was like i died and went to italy .
really ?
oh , my god !
you are born to do this .
i just hate to see you give it up , because , well ...
man , this is none of my business .
but lynette does ... bully you ... ... sometimes .
she doesn &apos;t mean to .
then don &apos;t let her . go to the mat on this .
she will respect you a lot more if you grew a pair .
i &apos;m not trying to insult you .
all i &apos;m saying is that ...
... i know what you &apos;re capable of .
and i believe in you .
i really needed to hear that .
thanks .
sabotage . everyone is capable of it .
but some go about it more ruthlessly than others .
like the ones who crave vengeance .
or the ones who hunger for love .
or the ones who are determined to burn bridges .
and then there are those who simply want something .
i wish daddy lived here
so he could tuck me in , too .
something that belongs to someone else .
i &apos;m working on it , piglet .
mama &apos;s working on it .
