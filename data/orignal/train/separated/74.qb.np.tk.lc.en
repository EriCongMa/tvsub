cary asked me .
i know .
he &apos;s just on a call .
so , the ira agreed to an off and compromise ,
on your tax case .
the ira ?
the ... the irs .
you &apos;ll have to pay a penalty ,
we can deal with all the specifics later ,
but you have some un @-@ cashed checks in your file .
you should take a look at those .
thanks .
i &apos;m not gay .
you asked whether i was gay ?
yes ...
two years ago .
i know .
i wanted to answer .
i &apos;m not gay , i &apos;m ...
... flexible .
okay .
flexible . good .
and , uh ...
lana delaney , this fbi agent ,
that &apos;s ... flexible ?
yeah . sort of .
because as your lawyer , i wouldn &apos;t ...
you know what , it &apos;s your life . you do what you want .
what ?
it &apos;s the veriscene case . the judgment &apos;s in .
we find out tomorrow .
that &apos;s good .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve got a bad feeling about this one .
how &apos;s everyone this morning ?
well , your honor .
we seem to have a designated hitter here today .
yes , your honor . my partner , will gardner ,
couldn &apos;t be in court ...
oh , you don &apos;t have to cover for him . i know will &apos;s suspended .
how &apos;s he doing ?
very well , thank you for asking .
like a kid with five days until christmas .
well , tell him he &apos;s missed .
shall we get started ?
plaintiff alleges that veriscene ,
a drug administered for the cure of acne
caused mr. goode irreversible sterility .
accordingly , i am entering judgment for the plaintiff ,
in the amount of $ 25 million in compensatory .
i acknowledge that this amount
is in excess of the $ 18 million requested by the plaintiff ,
but i find the actions here particularly heinous .
your honor ...
yes , mr. canning ?
you want to appeal ?
oh , i do . uhvehemently .
as is your right .
mr. goode , no matter where this ends up , i want you to know ,
justice was done here today .
whoo @-@ hoo ! yes !
congratulations .
i am rarely speechless , but i am speechless .
thank you . thank you both .
it &apos;s not over yet .
they &apos;re going to drag this out in appeals , so ...
i thought it was going against us .
sometimes fate smiles .
will , are you standing or sitting ?
which one do you want me to be ?
you &apos;re kidding .
you &apos;re kidding .
do you know what this means ?
that we can pay off our balloon payment .
and dodge the executioner for another quarter .
if you get a settlement .
where &apos;s canning at ? he &apos;ll appeal .
for effect . $ 25 million should motivate him .
peter , you okay ?
we have a problem with the house .
we ?
uh , jackie .
she paid ten percent in cash on the down payment .
apparently , she was bidding against someone .
me . she was bidding against me .
so i &apos;m planning on going ahead with the purchase
and then flipping the house in a few months .
okay .
are you moving in ?
just temporarily .
i think i could get more money for the house
if i did some work in the backyard .
why are you telling me this , peter ?
look , i don &apos;t want you to worry about these ...
decisions .
this is all temporary .
i &apos;m not trying to ...
colonize our past ?
well , i don &apos;t think i &apos;d exactly put it that way ,
but yes , i don &apos;t want these decisions to be misunderstood .
okay . i won &apos;t .
so ... we &apos;re making this work , right ?
oddly , yes , we are .
i heard cary is back with you guys .
yes , starts today .
he &apos;s a good guy .
wish him luck .
so , we &apos;ll need you out here until we get an office cleared out ,
if you &apos;re all right with that .
i am .
good . it &apos;ll just be a few weeks .
welcome back , cary .
yeah ?
um , is this f &amp; e construction ?
hello ?
who is this ?
uh , i &apos;m a lawyer following up on a un @-@ cashed check
from f &amp; e construction .
unfortunately , we &apos;ll need you to reissue the check .
who is this ?
um ... is this f &amp; e construction ?
yes .
i don &apos;t recognize your voice .
i &apos;m a lawyer representing ...
someone ...
uh , who has an un @-@ cashed check from f &amp; e construction ,
and she can &apos;t access her funds ,
unless you reissue , so ...
who &apos;s the check make out to ?
cash .
where are you calling from , lady ?
can you just reissue the check , sir ?
sure . give me a check number .
you know what , um , i &apos;ll call you back with that information .
thank you .
oh , hey , cary .
how are you doing ?
good .
you seem to be , too .
oh , it &apos;s just from being liaison to eli gold .
as soon as he &apos;s back on the campaign trail ,
i &apos;ll be out there with everyone else . where are you ?
i &apos;m out there with everyone else .
well , then you &apos;ll have company .
canning . oh , cary .
good to have you back .
thank you .
the veriscene case-- we &apos;re in the middle of negotiations .
yeah , go for it . i know my way around .
we &apos;re not committing to an offer yet ,
but if you have a number , we &apos;ll listen .
mr. canning , are you with us ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i was just texting my lawyer .
it &apos;s funny , isn &apos;t it , lawyers having lawyers ?
and my lawyer probably has a lawyer , too .
we should all be getting progressively smaller , like matryoshka dolls .
yes . so are we negotiating , or what are we doing ?
no , we &apos;re negotiating .
i @-@ i think i have an offer for you .
a one @-@ time offer .
zero ? really ?
you have five minutes to decide whether to take it .
i see . and if we don &apos;t ,
you have a bomb or something ?
sort of .
hi . we &apos;re all here . where are you ?
just changing . i &apos;ll be right in .
the rashs back , michael .
i know . i &apos;m trying the ointment three times a day .
you have to stop eating so much spicy food .
yes . no more thai food for you .
oh , please , it &apos;s just poop .
you shovel the stuff all day , buddy .
oh , god .
patti nyholm .
well , look at you .
and you .
poster child for motherhood today .
you have no changing tables in the restroom , will .
it &apos;s a lawsuit waiting to happen .
yep , doing our part to suppress the birth rate .
so , i need some legal advice on my contract .
oh , my god , wait .
you can &apos;t practice law anymore .
what was i thinking ?
no , thank you .
i &apos;ll be right out , michael .
this &apos;ll take a few minutes .
that must be reall hard on you , will ,
just sitting around watching all these lawyers
while you &apos;re , what , surfing the web ?
clipping coupons ?
what &apos;s up , patti ?
a lawsuit .
really ? which one ?
a new one . it &apos;ll be great being on opposite sides again ,
dusting it up ...
oh , wait . darn it .
you &apos;re not a lawyer anymore .
i keep forgetting .
so sorry i &apos;m late .
here &apos;s my lawyer now .
ms. nyholm , i believe you know everybody .
i think i do . hello .
how are your negotiations going ?
well , i don &apos;t know ,
i gave them five minutes to agree to my settlement offer ,
and that time is up ... now .
we &apos;re suing you .
on behalf of loc pharmaceuticals , makers of veriscene and elvatyl .
and their insurer , lifestate .
we joined forces to sue you for $ 50 million
for fraud and malicious prosecution .
come on , this is harassment .
is that you legal opinion , will ?
no , it &apos;s mine .
your company doesn &apos;t like being sued ,
try making products that don &apos;t kill and maim people .
here &apos;s a better idea--
stop intentionally and wrongfully instituting legal proceedings
you know are without merit .
we were just awarded $ 25 million ,
i &apos;d call that merit .
no . i would call that judicial bbery .
oops .
is that a sensitive topic ?
this case was built for a jury .
you requested a bench trial .
it &apos;s a million @-@ dollar case ,
and your basketball buddy awarded you $ 25 million .
i was cleared by a grand jury .
no .
you weren &apos;t indicted by a grand jury .
you gamed the system ; i know you , will .
you can &apos;t do that with me .
or with me .
that &apos;s right . we &apos;re the dream team .
jackie ?
mr. gold ?
hi .
peter said you were here .
shouldn &apos;t you be in synague ?
uh ... no .
how are you feeling ?
better .
good .
then i won &apos;t feel bad about saying this .
your son is going to lose .
without alicia , he will lose the governorship .
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know ...
she was on our side , jackie .
alicia was offering to help peter , then you got involved .
how did i get involved ?
this friggin &apos; house !
my god , i &apos;ve never heard
so much real estate talk in all my life .
if their separation goes wide , everything collapses .
eli , what do you want ?
i want you to apologize to her .
your son will not win without alicia ,
and i will not manage this campain without her .
so say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; even if you don &apos;t believe it .
i dreamt i died .
everybody just did what they always did .
they didn &apos;t care .
um , do you want me to get you a nurse or some .
are you religious ?
am i , um ... i ...
i thought jews believed in god .
yes , we all do ; every one of us .
i don &apos;t want to die .
i &apos;ll get you a nurse .
i don &apos;t want to die .
it &apos;s a scare tactic .
look at ketter sum holdings .
they sued the lawyers bringing class actions
against their artificial knees in order to scare them off .
there might be more .
i think patti is using this suit to fact @-@ find .
for an appeal ?
yes .
look who they &apos;re deposing .
kalinda , me .
patti doesn &apos;t have enough ,
so she &apos;s using this suit t
o find out if we did anything wrong .
i wish i could agree , but if the law taught me anything ,
it &apos;s that never , ever trust a man with a limp .
look , if they want to find out more about our tactics ,
we turn it back on them .
right , every time they ask a question , ask for more detail .
what did you mean by that ? can you explain ?
good . anything else ?
sorry .
okay ,
i will sit in with will ; who do we have for kalinda ?
most of our litigators were in on this .
so , they &apos;re all subject to being called .
all but one .
miss sharma , have you ever misrepresented your occupation
in order to interview a witness ?
could you be me specific ?
sure .
have you ever misrepresented your occupation
in order to interview a witness ,
as you did with my wife
to get into my house ?
objection , what does that have to do with the veriscene case ?
well , miss sharma claims
she &apos;s never broken the law in pursuit of a case .
i have firsthand knowledge of such law @-@ breaking .
so , miss sharma , can you please answer the question ?
could you repeat the question ?
sure . were you kalinda sharma &apos;s direct supervisor ?
we don &apos;t have direct supervisors here .
did you tell her to investigate on the veriscene case ?
in what way , &quot; investigate &quot; ?
okay , will .
i get it .
we can do this all day .
you obfuscate ,
i pull the judge out of court ,
he raps you on the knuckles for being unresponsive ,
and all you &apos;ve done is waste half a day .
i take exception to your suggestion
that we &apos;re wasting anything .
but remember ,
i &apos;m not the one with a balloon payment due on his office .
was that the elephant in the room ?
hello .
you were gonna get back to me .
i ... who is this ?
f &amp; e construction .
you wanted me to reissue check .
yes , i did . i said i &apos;d get back to you , though .
i know , but you didn &apos;t .
so i decided to call you .
okay , um , let me get all my ducks in a row , sir ,
and i &apos;ll get back to you .
sir ?
no , you won &apos;t .
excuse me ?
you won &apos;t call me back .
you have no intention of calling me back .
i said i would , and so i ...
actually , um
i think we &apos;re done here .
no , we &apos;re not .
could you be more specific ?
did you introduce judges
to bookies at your wednesday night basketball ...
objection , relevance .
isn &apos;t judge wynter relevant ?
the man who awarded you $ 25 million ?
isn &apos;t he one of the judges you introduce to bookies ?
objection .
and weren &apos;t you confronted
about this at the grand jury ?
excuse me , ms. nyholm ,
you have reference proceedings
that resulted in a sealed transcript .
yes , but mr. gardner can answer
to his own testimony .
this question requires your knowledge
of the grand jury investigation .
no , it merely requires mr. gardner &apos;s knowledge
of the grand jury investigation .
all right , we &apos;re taking this to the judge .
okay , okay , okay .
you are all new to me ,
so my apologies if i need to be reminded of your names ,
but ms.
lockhart .
you are arguing
the only way these questions could be asked
is if they were taken from sealed transcripts ?
yes , your honor ,
someone is leaking them grand jury testimony ,
and we would argue this line of questioning
should be stricken .
if i may interject , your honor ,
we &apos;re merely asking questions
based on our own knowledge .
and if you can allow me an explanation ,
the movements that you see ,
uh , these random movements
they &apos;re the consequence of a neurological disorder
i suffer from called tardive dyskinesia .
and i just didn &apos;t want you to misinterpret any of movements .
okay , i won &apos;t .
i &apos;ve had this condition since childhood .
are you going somewhere with this , mr. canning ?
no , i just wanted to explain .
okay , thanks .
i will allow these questions to proceed .
your honor .
but if you produce evidence these questions are based
on sealed grand jury evidence ,
i will exclude all such testimony from this suit .
we need to get kalinda to follow patti and find out
who &apos;s leaking this grand jury testimony .
no .
we need to talk settlement .
will , we &apos;re vulnerable .
no , we &apos;re not .
there &apos;s nothing there .
but what is there doesn &apos;t look good .
you played basketball with him ,
you introduced him to a bookie , and he awarded us
seven million above our ask .
here &apos;s what i suggest .
we offer to drop the veriscene class action .
it &apos;s what they want , anyway .
damn it .
i know , but it &apos;s the smart move .
we need get this behind us .
this balloon payment , our clients ...
patric edelstein is making noise .
i mean , he &apos;s 20 % of our quarter .
everything &apos;s falling apart as we fight this .
uh , do you want me ...
no , it &apos;s all right , we &apos;ve just been ...
riding close to the edge this whole year .
it &apos;s not for anyone to know .
i understand .
okay .
let &apos;s make this go away .
they brought out the buffet .
this must be serious .
you drop the lawsuit ,
and we drop the veriscene class action .
that &apos;s our offer ; take it or leave it .
fruit ?
please .
no . but thank you .
don &apos;t you want to take back to your client ?
no .
we &apos;re not caving on the appeal .
we know .
you have no case . not without some grand jury leak .
you don &apos;t understand .
this isn &apos;t about a case .
you @-@ you want to tell them ?
no , no .
you &apos;re much better at the nasty stuff .
we &apos;re not here to settle .
we &apos;re here to destroy you .
our clients are tired of being sued by you .
four class actions in two years ?
they &apos;ve taken it personally .
look at you . hi , boo @-@ boo .
they &apos;ve set aside a large sum of money to put you out of business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here , to make an example of you .
超级追捕队是一批警察精英 对二人穷追不舍
you &apos;ve seen butch cassidy and the sundance kid .
we &apos;re the super @-@ posse .
so , thank you for the offer ,
but no .
we &apos;re getting paid a lot of money to make you go bankrupt .
thank you for the fruit , though .
hi . that &apos;s pretty .
well , kalinda , funny seeing you here .
yeah , almost as funny as seeing you here ,
with ms. nyholm , leaking grand jury testimony .
mr. wiley is legally sharing
his own testimony before the grand jury .
really ?
yeah , the state &apos;s attorney
wasn &apos;t interested in pursuing the case against will gardner .
ms. nyholm is .
and our kids love playing together .
so it &apos;s all perfectly legal .
hi .
cary , we &apos;re having some trouble with andrew wiley ,
an investigator from the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
yes , i know .
he &apos;s the one working with nyholm and canning .
i doubt that .
wiley doesn &apos;t break the rules .
unless he &apos;s using his own testimony .
yep . so we need something from you .
well , you know that i can &apos;t share what i know about the grand jury
because that would be unethical .
yes , but you can use your knowledge in another way .
thank you for coming .
it means so much to me .
i didn &apos;t come here to visit , jackie .
i came to recommend that you retain a lawyer .
you ... why ?
you took money from my children &apos;s trust
so that you could outbid me
on my family home .
i intend to sue you .
i &apos;m sorry , alicia .
this family &apos;s been through so much , and i ...
i thought i knew best .
i &apos;m so sorry .
jackie , please .
what do you want ?
i want you to accept my apology .
no , you don &apos;t .
i want to make things right .
it &apos;ll be good for zach and grace and ... and peter .
you want peter to win .
that &apos;s what you want .
eli was here , wasn &apos;t he ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i ...
he ...
he can &apos;t do it without you .
here &apos;s what i want , jackie .
you sign the house over to the kids ,
you put it in their names , i won &apos;t sue .
you want me to accept your apology , show me you mean it .
sign the house over to the kids .
excuse me .
watch your toes .
everyone , please , indoor voices .
your honor , like you ,
i look at life a little differently--
with a little more caution ,
a little more quiet .
why like me ?
i &apos;m sorry , i ...
you said &quot; like me . &quot; what do you mean ?
what we mean , your honor ,
is that the defense &apos;s motion is a desperate ploy
to avoid responsibility .
mr. canning asked ms. sharma one question
that couldn &apos;t have been in mr. wiley &apos;s grand jury testimony ,
your honor .
the $ 2,000 in cash mr. gardner gave to a judge--
money that was supposedly for unicef .
was for unicef .
this was evidence that mr.wiley
personally witnessed , your honor .
yes , but the question isn &apos;t whether he personally witnessed it or not .
andrew , did you testify to it or did you witness it ?
wait a minute , you can &apos;t talk to our client .
andrew , which one did you do ?
oh , my god .
andrew , no , stop right there !
he &apos;s right , i just witnessed it .
due to this admission , your honor ,
all the evidence regarding mr. gardner &apos;s
bribing of a judge should be excluded .
your honor , i &apos;d like to add another name to our witness list :
alicia florrick .
i have to witness prep you .
they &apos;re coming after you ,
trying to get to will bribing judges another way .
i know .
f &amp; e construction .
what is it ?
why ?
i found a check in your file from canada .
an un @-@ cashed check from 2007 .
yeah . that @-@ that shouldn &apos;t be there .
that should be in my personal file .
it &apos;s for $ 21,000 .
that would go a long way to pay your tax bill .
i know . do you have the check ?
thanks .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s complicated .
i called the number on it .
as part of your tax work ,
i called employers for updated checks .
when ?
when did i call ? tuesday .
did you speak to anyone ?
yes .
who ?
i don &apos;t know .
he wouldn &apos;t give me his name .
he asked for the number on your check .
did you give it ?
no .
thanks .
he called me back .
what &apos;s going on , kalinda ?
it &apos;s just something from an old thing .
&quot; an old thing &quot; ?
is it lemond bishop ?
no . i &apos;m gonna go and take care of it .
kalinda .
yeah ?
nothing .
i &apos;ll be back .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m gonna go take care of it .
that might be too big for you .
i &apos;ve got some lighter ones around the corner .
no , this one &apos;s fine .
you sure ?
you need anything else , let me know .
and it &apos;s not just the sink , the shower , too .
okay , i &apos;ll call down , but we &apos;re probably on our own .
they go out of their way not to fix things
when they are converting the condos , so it forces you to buy .
are you gonna ?
buy ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like it here , but maybe there &apos;s better .
dad wants you to buy the house .
he ...
he told you
he wanted to sell it , didn &apos;t he ?
would you ?
buy the house ? no .
why not ? you were going to .
i know , but everything &apos;s up in the air right now .
you got a raise .
yes . but sometimes getting a raise means
that you cost more ;
so when they &apos;re looking to downsize ,
it &apos;s easier to fire you than someone cheaper .
and they &apos;re looking to downsize ?
no , but we &apos;re just going through a bad spell .
you should move in .
we should all live in one house .
what ?
not like you guys are married .
like a commune .
i &apos;ve kind of grown to like you .
yeah ? not zach ?
no , not zach .
he &apos;s getting too big .
you shouldn &apos;t answer it .
it &apos;s probay work .
they can &apos;t fire you if they can &apos;t find you .
very funny .
hello ?
alicia florrick ?
is it work ?
no . wrong number .
this is kalinda . please leave a message .
you ready for this ?
i hope so .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;ll all be about me .
just tell the truth .
have you seen kalinda ?
no , why ?
she &apos;s not in today .
she &apos;s probably just late .
you were second chair
on the veriscene case , right , mrs. florrick ?
yes .
did you have ex parte communication
with judge wynter during the trial ?
no .
and you have no personal relationship with judge wynter ?
that &apos;s correct .
but someone you know does ?
you mean will ?
no .
i mean your husband .
peter florrick .
i @-@ i have no idea .
you have no idea whether your husband
has a pernal relationship with judge wynter ?
i mean , i know that he knows him ,
but i don &apos;t know the extent of their relationship .
did you know that your husband
met with judge wynter three times
in the week leading up to the veriscene verdict ?
no .
really ?
on the eve of judge wynter &apos;s decision
to award you $ 25 million ,
your husband met with him three times ,
and you had no idea ?
that &apos;s correct .
are we working off the assumption they did , in fact , meet ?
how do we know this ?
because we &apos;re going to subpoena peter florrick .
you &apos;re going to subpoena the state &apos;s attorney ?
we already have .
hold the door , please .
thanks .
no problem . 28th ?
yeah .
so , you seeing alicia ?
am i seeing alicia ?
no , actually , i &apos;m being deposed .
oh . really ?
although it occurred to me
i &apos;ve never seen where alicia works .
does she know you &apos;re coming ?
not that it matters either way .
i don &apos;t know .
so you must be looking forward to getting back to the law ?
i am .
i think convicts call it &quot; short time . &quot;
really ?
i never did .
well , hi .
hi .
look who i found .
yes . welcome .
i thought i would come and meet you .
which one ?
you , peter .
thought you might want to see my office .
hello , eli .
i ...
hi .
h @-@ llo , everyone .
hi . i was just showing peter my office .
he &apos;s here for a deposition .
really ?
great .
cary .
hey , cary .
hello .
mr. florrick . how you doing ?
hey , how you guys doing ?
so how &apos;s it going here ?
at lockhart @-@ gardner ? it &apos;s good .
i mean , i loved the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
but there &apos;s lot of smart people here , too .
one of our new associates .
hey , kalinda .
it &apos;s a surprise party for you .
i &apos;m impressed .
what you have done in three years is amazing .
thank you .
okay .
i guess i should go meet my executioners .
oh , peter , you didn &apos;t have to do this .
you could &apos;ve blown it off .
it &apos;s a stupid nuisance suit .
i wanted to get out and stretch my legs .
hey . come over tonight .
i &apos;ll have to work .
just to see the house .
stay for five minutes , tops .
i wish i could .
peter ?
have you checked in on jackie lately ?
have i ? yeah . why ?
i &apos;m worried
she seems confused .
she &apos;s getting older .
congratulations .
you made it .
you need money ?
just an advance on the work so far .
why ?
kalinda , what &apos;s going on ?
i have to go .
you have to ... why ?
i thought you were liking it here .
i am liking it here .
okay , then you would understand my confusion .
look ...
we &apos;re in a bit of trouble .
we &apos;re short on receivables .
patric edelstein is delaying his monthly ,
and we have some long @-@ term suits that haven &apos;t paid out yet .
i can get you some .
not everything .
okay .
this is good @-@ bye ?
just a little bit .
you &apos;re gonna make me cry .
i don &apos;t know .
it feels like things are falling apart .
you &apos;ll build them up again , that &apos;s what you do .
and you met with judge wynter three times
before this last thursday , the day of the verdict ?
yes .
is that a lot for you ?
yeah .
in fact , before these three meetings ,
you had only met him once ...
in 2008
at a judges &apos; lunch ,
with 12 other judges .
yeah , that sounds about right .
so why &apos;d you meet with him ?
those three times ?
i like him .
did the subject of your wife &apos;s lawsuit
come up at these meetings ?
no .
really ?
at the same time you were meeting with this judge ,
your wife had a suit in front of him ,
and the subject never came up ?
that &apos;s correct .
this grand jury investigation
into will gardner &apos;s supposed bribing of three judges ,
including judge wynter ...
objection .
we are not refering to the content of that investigation ,
just to mr. florrick &apos;s supervision of it .
but just to correct you ,
ms. scott @-@ car had supervision over it .
yes , until you removed her .
i removed her because the grand jury had concluded .
but the state &apos;s attorney can bring charges again ?
he can . i chose not to .
you also chose not to bring charges against the three judges
involved in this bribery scheme .
the supposed bribery scheme ? yes .
why not ?
i didn &apos;t want to .
i thought ms. scott @-@ carr had gone beyond her directive .
so when you met with judge wynter ...
he owed you ?
did you not want to answer ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know that was a question .
didn &apos;t you ask judge wynter to decide
this verdict for your wife as a quid pro quo
for dropping his investigation ?
no .
but isn &apos;t that a fair conclusion ?
no .
and how is that ?
because my wife and i are separated .
then i ...
that is news to me .
then what other reason could there be for these meetings ?
his support for my campaign .
so i guess you could accuse me
of being corrupt for myself ,
but not for my wife .
how &apos;s it going ?
good . you ?
good .
i have to head out . i just wanted to say good night .
that man who called me ,
f &amp; e constructionon ,
he called me at home ,
and he said my name .
he said your name ?
yes .
did you give your name ?
no .
kalinda , who is this man ?
we said we would be up front with each other .
i know .
is this man dangerous ?
yeah .
well , who is he ?
he &apos;s my husband .
come on . you don &apos;t have anything .
the state &apos;s attorney just told you
there &apos;s no way he could have done this for his wife
because they &apos;re separated .
and he &apos;s done this with some considerable expense
to his own political career ...
because it &apos;s now in the record that they &apos;ve separated .
so , what do you have ?
a passion to see this through .
we take back our offer to drop the class action .
you lost . face it .
they &apos;re right .
we lost .
we should probably just head out . you think ?
here &apos;s the thing , though .
we were the distraction .
you were the distraction ? what does that mean ?
have you checked on your top client , patric edelstein ?
he &apos;s no longer your top client .
he &apos;s ours .
we just got the text .
he &apos;s been unhappy with will &apos;s suspension ,
and with your distraction with this lawsuit .
sleight of hand . you were watching the right ,
you should &apos;ve been watching the left .
mommy !
that &apos;s right , we &apos;re done here .
mommy &apos;s coming home .
after you .
no , no , after you .
please .
mommy !
hello !
let &apos;s go . come on .
oops .
and it &apos;s too late to call him .
they planned on that , too .
so , tomorrow ?
tomorrow .
how you doing ?
me ? i &apos;m , uh ...
okay .
you ?
same .
that was weird .
with peter today ?
yes , it was .
do you think it was a mistake ?
no .
good night , alicia .
good night , will .
mom , my doorknob &apos;s still broken .
how about some wine ?
no , i have to get back .
they didn &apos;t change much .
the house ? yeah .
they tried to flip it ,
but they didn &apos;t put any work into it so nobody wanted it .
thanks for today .
i think you stopped the suit .
i guess i just told the truth .
that &apos;s bigger than you think .
dad , the pizza &apos;s ready .
okay .
pizza ?
no , i have to get up early for work tomorrow .
things are in flux .
when aren &apos;t things in flux ?
hey , come say good @-@ bye to your mom .
she &apos;s leaving .
i love you both . i &apos;ll see you in a few days .
stay , mom .
no one will think it means anything .
just ...
have some pizza .
then you can go .
you &apos;re getting big .
i love you .
