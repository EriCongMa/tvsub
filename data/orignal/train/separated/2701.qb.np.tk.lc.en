hello ? hey , ro .
no , jackie took meadow to the movies .
he said not late .
all right . fine .
what ?
i &apos;m not thrilled about this thing with jackie and meadow .
i think she came home so they could go out .
so what ? he &apos;s a good kid . comes from good stock .
he &apos;s on his best behavior . i don &apos;t picture meadow with someone like him .
someone like him ?
he &apos;s one of us .
were you happy when she was with jamal ginsberg , the hasidic homeboy ?
scraped through that by the skin of our ass .
i just don &apos;t want her to miss any opportunities .
she should be at the museum in her free time .
not watching tv .
you &apos;d rather she look at soup cans than be close to home ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , you talk to her , and i &apos;ll talk to jackie jr .
here &apos;s your edgar allan poe paper .
you did it already ?
no problem .
thanks .
i would &apos;ve done it . i was gonna do it . i just couldn &apos;t get through the books .
i never should &apos;ve taken literature of obsession .
i owe you big time .
thanks .
how can i repay you ?
i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you surprise me ?
on your mark , get set , go !
i kicked your ass .
you cheat .
oh , my eye .
there &apos;s too much chlorine . i swallowed some water .
you girls see me ?

hey , everybody .
shit !

don &apos;t cut your feet !
hey , it &apos;s sunday morning and ...
good morning .
hello .
morning .
did jackie call ?
he &apos;s with your brother .
so i &apos;ve been thinking about a car .
i knew i &apos;d get hit up on this trip .
you buy sapphires ...
but a student has to take the bus ?
what do you need a car for ?
lt &apos;d be nice to hop in a car and come have dinner with you .
they steal cars in new york . parking is impossible ...
the bus gets you here in 45 minutes .
i &apos;m not asking for anything fancy .
could &apos;ve had a car last year .
eric &apos;s car ? is that a sick joke ?
his father &apos;s now in a mental health facility .
see how this semester goes . you have a lot of work to do .
concentrate on that .
i am concentrating on that ! christ , you &apos;re a broken record !
take it down a notch .
god .
we wanna make sure you take advantage of all the city offers .
culturally , socially
educationally .
right before the snap , the ball is still .
but the qb &apos;s eyes can tell you whether he &apos;ll pass or hand it off .
it happens in a split second . but you can learn what his habits are .
once you know these habits , he &apos;s fucked .
hey .
good morning .
a.j. , try what i told you .
i will . thanks , jackie .
the wall of pride . what kind of animals ... ?
they didn &apos;t steal anything . they just did a number on the place .
they left this .
you make this pizza ?
who made this ?
we &apos;re asking you .
this your store logo , sir ?
that &apos;s my box .
it was at a crime scene .
my pizza never hurt anybody . you no find any bacteria here .
kids broke into the high school . they left this .
tell me who , i &apos;ll kick their asses .
i got it , pop .
that &apos;s a custom job .
meatball , pepperoni , sausage peppers , onions
extra mozzarella
this pie fit a pattern ?
anyone order this regularly ?
only one .
who ?
i &apos;d rather not say .
tell me ! i find these bastards !
pop , goes in the back . go ahead .
sir .
yes , officer ?
word to the wise . technically , you &apos;re an accessory after the fact .
i cannot believe this . do you know how serious this is ?
do you ?
answer me right now .
yes .
yes , what ?
i know it &apos;s serious .
so why did you do it ?
i don &apos;t know .
why did you do it ?
do you hate the school or have a problem with someone ?
no .
then why ?
it just happened .
we went in as a goof . someone threw something in the pool .
a couple of guys started throwing stuff in . we just did it .
and if they were jumping off a bridge , would you just do that too ?
no .
what are you doing here ?
answer your father .
i got sent home .
why ?
why ?
i got in trouble .
your son broke into his school and vandalized the pool .
how do you vandalize a pool ?
they threw stuff in , broke things .
why &apos;d you do that ?
screwing around .
on your mother &apos;s birthday ?
it wasn &apos;t . it was after midnight .
what are you , fucking stupid ? huh ?
so you &apos;re suspended ?
i don &apos;t know .
this is serious . he may be expelled .
what &apos;d they say ?
nothing . they sent me home .
you have to go see the principal .
on your mother &apos;s birthday .
they &apos;re gonna call you .
just when everything was going good , huh ?
you &apos;re gonna miss the big game .
you &apos;re screwing everything up . your football career down the drain !
wow .
there it is .
beautiful ring .
i know .
gorgeous , carm .
i want you ladies to try this .
mozzarella ? i was gonna get the hot antipasto .
it &apos;s not mozzarella . this is burrata . i had it flown in from italy .
it &apos;s more subtle than mozzarella , with a nutty flavor .
thanks .
i &apos;m not big on nuts .
a little pepper ? carm , on your half ?
it &apos;s all about the contrast : crisp beans and smooth cheese .
no , i &apos;m fine .
buon appetito .
tastes like mozzarella and string beans . you have it , carm .
i want the hot antipasto .
i &apos;d like to make a toast . to the friendship between our two children .
i &apos;m happy to see my son spending time with meadow .
she &apos;ll be a good influence on him .
you did a great job . she &apos;s wonderful .
well , thank you . salute .
it &apos;s nice to see our families united . like with ralphie .
he goes on and on about tony . he &apos;s happy to be getting closer to him .
ralph is a real find , hang on to him .
it was tough at first .
i was afraid everyone was gonna think that i didn &apos;t mourn jack enough .
oh , artie !
he &apos;s under a lot of stress . i hear charmaine hired a lawyer .
divorce ?
it &apos;s funny , but you think , you know
the men in our lives have been , you know what , and we stay together .
and here &apos;s artie , a regular guy , hardworking
his marriage is in the pisciatoio .
you can push a man only so far .
true . very true .

you want to go to the zoo ?
the zoo ?
yeah .
i try to get there once a year .
we &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll call you .
amazing thing about snakes is that they reproduce spontaneously .
what do you mean ?
they have male and female sex organs .
somebody you don &apos;t trust , you call a snake .
how can you trust a guy who can literally go fuck themselves ?
don &apos;t you think that expression came from when the snake tempted eve ?
hey , snakes were fucking themselves long before adam and eve showed up , t.
how you doing ?
all right .
hey , jackie , thanks for coming by . how are you ?

you show respect and come from a good family .

as far as my daughter goes
you know i want the best for her .
i &apos;m going to be very protective over her .
you understand , right ?
of course .
if you want to spend time with her , i want the best from you in school .
yeah , right . i know it ...
shut up .
listen to me .
i know i &apos;ve been saying this to you all along , but now it &apos;s different .
understand ?
i just got an a on a paper .
you did ?
edgar allan poe . good writer , what a fucking nut job .
he &apos;s the guy who did all the vincent price shit , right ?
he smoked opium and married his cousin . he was from the bronx .
so you got an a , huh ?
i &apos;m doing good , tony .
let &apos;s keep it that way .

welcome , everybody , to opening night at crazy horse .
i &apos;m excited to have , from u @-@ dub , our very first band .
please welcome the miami relatives !
what do you think ?
what ?
what do you think ?
i can &apos;t hear a word you say .
tony and sil couldn &apos;t make it , but this is from us . congratulations .
do you like the band ?
what ?
how do you like the band ?
matush , you don &apos;t got the maseratis ?
versace . you try it yet ?

what &apos;s up ? !
come on . let &apos;s go . out .
i got friends here , man ! let me call my man carlo !
i see you here again , i &apos;m going to crack your head .
call carlo !
you have to wonder what they &apos;re thinking .
they &apos;re thinking , &quot; madonna , you guys ever smell yourselves ? &quot;
you &apos;re probably right , huh ?
except for you .
what you got on even a baboon would love .
the eyes are innocent .
like a baby &apos;s .
yeah , he could innocently maul you into ten pieces .
usually they just engage in what &apos;s called threat behavior .
because they did their mauling . now they just give the look .
malocchio .
you know why they &apos;re primates ? they groom each other .
that i like .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a tibetan talisman for protection .
i knew it . i knew there had to be something .
what ?
what &apos;s wrong ? it &apos;s a buddhist symbol .
my sister was a buddhist .
she &apos;s a wacky job .
i see , so i got to be a wacky job too ?
it is a little wacky . what &apos;s wrong with catholicism ?
which you fucking practice every fucking day , i &apos;m sure .
so i pray a little , and i meditate in the morning .
it clears my mind and my heart for the day .
a buddhist selling $ 150,000 cars .
the first noble truth is : life is suffering .
but the buddha preached participation in the sorrows of the world .
you make a sale , you don &apos;t make a sale , and itˇs a tiny little thing .
what &apos;s so funny ?
you came here .
what , the zoo ?
i said zoo and you came .
what &apos;s this , a fucking head @-@ trip now ? huh ? nice .
sort of .
i don &apos;t like that .
you &apos;re very sweet .
you came .
i &apos;m crazy about you .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
i never met anybody like you .
okay , class , come this way . stay together , kids . come on .
we &apos;re going to see some tigers .
do you take your kids to the zoo ?
yeah .
and now we &apos;re here .
see you later .
who was that ?
my hard @-@ on .
between the buddhism and talk about the family , poor you .
let me see if it &apos;s really gone .
you lie .
you know snakes can fuck themselves ?
give me your hand .
oh , jesus christ .
don &apos;t move .
what ?
see ...
if you ...
cannot ...
so , what happened ?
he was at the crazy horse and some zip told my man : new management , new rules .
so i asked around . i heard about some guy , multi @-@ something .
some guy in the soprano family was running things . i go , &quot; whoa ! &quot;
chris moltisanti .
yeah .
i know chris .
what &apos;s your name again ?
matush .
normally i would never get involved with a stranger .
if carlo here is vouching for you
i &apos;m willing to make an exception .
thank you .
what &apos;d i tell you ?
you know who my father was ?
the golfer ? u.s. open ?
chris and i are associates . you got nothing to worry about .
i &apos;ll call carlo in a couple days .
meeting over .
verbum dei has a zero tolerance policy in cases of vandalism .
it demands the expulsion of the offending student .
i told him .
you see ?
having said that ...
in this case , after much deliberation ...
we decided upon a suspended sentence .
this has been arrived at ...
based on his academic performance . and his involvement in sports .
his academic performance ?
he &apos;s brought his gpa to a c @-@ minus .
what is the punishment ?
we suggest and hope
it &apos;s meted out parentally .
so it &apos;s not exactly zero tolerance .
each child is special .
that &apos;s a principle of this school .
well , what about detention ?
a lawsuit forced us to eliminate detention .
he &apos;s off the football team , right ?
no .
studies at harvard have shown that boys
have success in avoiding pitfalls when they remain involved in sport .
you better wipe that smile off your face .
i told him he &apos;d be off the team .
you know , now you &apos;re kind of ...
undermining the ...
it &apos;s not only skill anthony has shown on the field , its leadership as well .
we feel it &apos;s against his interests to sever his relationship with the squad .
well , if you think that &apos;s best .
however ...
if there is one more infraction
the sentence will go into effect and anthony will be expelled .
do you understand this , anthony ?
yes .
you completely sold us out in there .
what &apos;d i do ?
they &apos;re not punishing him , and you went along .
i suggested detention .
that was a charade so the football team can win the big game .
we &apos;ve been waiting for years for him to get off the couch .
we should keep this in the family . he isnˇt getting off that easy .
overall it &apos;s been a good two weeks .
what about the nightmares ?
none .
i had a dream where i lit the big torch at the olympics .
what do you think that represented ?
well ...
work has been good .
my sales are way up .
and my performance has been commended by mercedes @-@ benz usa with a plaque .
what &apos;s going on with your social life ?
nothing .
right now .
but it &apos;s okay .
what i &apos;m going to say is a little delicate , but i think it &apos;s important .
when you called me last week to cancel , i heard a man &apos;s voice .
my car broke down .
it could &apos;ve been the mechanic .
i see .
i &apos;m offended you put it that way .
offended ? why ?
well , i don &apos;t pay you to be under your surveillance .
how dare you ?
you came to me after attempting suicide over the breakup with barry .
i ask you because you &apos;re under my care .
it &apos;s unprofessional to confront me this way .
suicide is something i take very seriously .
the doctor in the er said it was only suicidal ideation .
is he trained to give those diagnoses ?
my car broke down .
fine .
i &apos;ll believe you .
thank you .
to the crazy horse , buona fortuna .
salute .
club business isn &apos;t easy , i tell you .
with the bing , everybody only sees the glitz and glamour .
nobody knows what goes into it .
there &apos;s a lot to deal with , i know .
see , it &apos;s one thing to have a bar .
when you &apos;re dealing with performers
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s music , tits , fire @-@ eaters . it &apos;s a whole other game .
ultimately you &apos;re relying on them to get the customers in ...
and spend money .
all right . i &apos;ll take it upstairs .
jackie , how are you ?
all right .
how you doing ?
somebody &apos;s sitting there .
7 and 7 and whatever my friend wants .
i &apos;m good .
just 7 and 7 .
okay .
congrats on the club .
i admire your progress since you got your button .
i wanted to have a sit down with you about a friend .
when did you want to do this ?
now .
now &apos;s okay to chat , not a sit down .
this friend was moving x at the club , and he got thrown out on his ass .
and ?
i wanted to ask you , as a favor , to let him keep a little action going on .
you get a piece of what he does .
x is federal territory now .
i don &apos;t want it in my club .
it would mean a lot to me .
you &apos;ve got a lot of balls . did you hear what i said ?
what &apos;d i say ?
no .
end of chat .
okay , thanks .
it &apos;s all taken care of .
thanks , man .
you just can &apos;t do it in the club . have your customers meet you outside .
outside where ?
use your car . or their car .
find an alley ... i got to think it all out for you ?
that &apos;s going to make things harder .
this all happens for a good reason . beyond anything you could know .
in time , everything will be revealed . you &apos;ll be back inside . don &apos;t worry .
if that &apos;s the way it is , that &apos;s the way it is . i &apos;ll see you .
aren &apos;t you forgetting something ?
what ?
i &apos;m looking out for you here . i got to eat too , right ?
yeah , sure . i &apos;ll take care of you .
i &apos;ll be by every sunday .
cool .
your father and i discussed your punishment .
you &apos;re grounded for a month .
no nintendo , no dvds , no skateboards .
no computer .
i use it for school .
get the typewriter .
dad threw it out .
then use a pen . it worked for einstein .
and you &apos;re going to work your ass off around here .
okay .
you got no choice .
go to the garage and organize it .
jackie jr. did that the other day .
see what i &apos;m saying about him ?
take a lesson from jackie and get your act together .
kid &apos;s pre @-@ med at rutgers , he finds time to help out .
and you &apos;re going to clean the gutters .
what gutters ?
on the roof .
where ?
on the edge . they collect water .
what ?
don &apos;t get smart !
i don &apos;t know .
the drainpipes for the rain ?
come here .
very good . a lady of discerning taste .
come on !
i told you once .
jackie said as long as i stay ...
don &apos;t fucking name @-@ drop me !
we &apos;re going to take a walk .
well , right arm &apos;s still good . no ?
你觉得这很好笑吗 ?
sorry .
tell me what happened .
i did like you said . i stayed outside .
you must &apos;ve disrespected them or something .
i didn &apos;t do fuck !
did you mention that i sat down with chris ?
they didn &apos;t give a shit .
i don &apos;t think they like you .
i got to pee .
can you give me the thing ?
get the nurse to help you . that &apos;s what they get paid for .
maybe she &apos;ll be fine and give you a cheap thrill .
hello ? kelli ! hey , hon ! it &apos;s your sister . yeah .
now this is the most crucial part .
you put the pasta back in the pot . you add a little gravy ...
and a little butter .
then
you put the fire back on
for 45 seconds , stir it up nice .
45 seconds ?
yeah . that way the macaroni absorbs the gravy instead of just coats it .
this is for flavor .
i need a favor .
what ?
i need a piece . i mean , i don &apos;t need one . but ...
you know .
anything you want to tell me ?
no .
it &apos;s just i think it &apos;s time i , you know ...
what are you looking to get ?
what do you suggest ?
me , i like to know the motherfucker &apos;s going to work .
and a.38
it &apos;ll never jam on you .
plus it &apos;s small .
if you want to make a point , go with something bigger .
it &apos;s not for intimidation . just in case .
yeah , i &apos;d go with the.38.
you can have this one . i got another one under the bed .
how much i owe you for it ?
get out of here . your money &apos;s no good .
macaroni &apos;s ready !
i just want to tell you that i don &apos;t expect anything from you .
well , kindness . that &apos;s it .
okay .
you really are in love with yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
what do you mean ?
conceited ?
self @-@ centered .
&quot; okay . &quot; i mean there &apos;s a bunch of alternates you could &apos;ve said .
you deprive yourself of nothing .
you think i &apos;m vain ?
i think you &apos;re wonderful .
and her name is g ...
my accounts are in bad neighborhoods .
i know why you lie .
but you don &apos;t have to .
can i hold it ?
it &apos;s heavy . is it loaded ?
nothing more useless than an unloaded gun .
there you go .
mr. waste management .
come here .
i mean , we &apos;re paying the school , we &apos;re buying a service .
if it &apos;s their opinion that he shouldn &apos;t get treated too harshly
you got to listen to the experts , right ?
what else is going on how was the rest of your week ?
to be honest ? very good .
why is that ?
well , that &apos;s how life is , i guess .
sometimes good . sometimes bad . things come , things go .
how is it between you and carmela ?
she was moody , now she &apos;s her old self .
maybe it was coming here .
possibly .
well , you do look happy , i must say .
yeah .
went to the zoo .
the zoo ?
you know , sometimes you got to get away and stop and smell the gorilla shit .
good to be in nature .
and the zoo made you happy .
yeah .
i think a lot of it &apos;s because of you .
you put a lot of time into me .
now it &apos;s paying off .
the progress you make is up to you .
and how honest you are with yourself and me .
well , i am improving .
you have to participate in the suffering of the world .
your thoughts have an eastern flavor to them .
i lived in jersey my whole life .
i mean eastern
in terms of asian , like buddhist or taoist
sun tzu .
i told you about him .
we have to stop now .
all right .
this is the co @-@ pay i owe you from last month .
well , you gave me too much .
well , i gave you a little extra for the good results this week .
i can &apos;t accept it .
give it to charity .
you better get your phone . i &apos;ll see you next week .
hello ?
hi , mom .
hi , jason .
how are you ?
i hate all of them .
who ?
my patients . lying to me , full of shit
with no concern for what i do or the position they put me in .
i just hate them .
fuck them . quit .
right now that doesn &apos;t sound like a bad idea .
i &apos;m sorry .
