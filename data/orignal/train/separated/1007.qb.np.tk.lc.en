drop , three .
drop , two .
drop , four .
all pins down .
preparing to open .
3 @-@ 2 @-@ 4 . wait !
you okay ?
what happened ?
i said wait . you didn &apos;t wait .
10,000 man @-@ hours to get this close to the dutchman ,
and you blow up my evidence .
agent burke , how did you know it was gonna do that ?
3 @-@ 2 @-@ 4 .
look at your phones .
what &apos;s it spell ?
&quot; fbi . &quot;
yeah-- &quot; fbi . &quot;
apparently , he knew we were coming .
you think so , copernicus ?
somebody want to tell me what this is ? huh ? anybody ?
nobody knows what it is ? great .
look at you .
how many of you went to harvard ?
don &apos;t raise your hands . don &apos;t .
ah , diana . look at this .
apparently , our boy has a sense of humor .
what ?
neal caffrey escaped .
what &apos;s this ?
u.s. marshals are requesting your help .
my help ?
director thompson asked for you personally .
me ? why would he want me ?
probably because you &apos;re the onlyone who ever caught him .
纽约 精英调查组
agent burke .
i &apos;m thompson , u.s. marshals .
appreciate the help . you were the case agent .
yes , i was .
so you &apos;ll agree that this is an unusual situation .
why would neal run with three months left
on a four @-@ year sentence ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re wondering .
this is warden haskley .
agent burke , fbi .
you &apos;re the guy who dropped the ball .
you , of all people , should know what neal caffrey &apos;s capable of .
i know i spent three years of my life chasing him
and you let him walk out the front door .
gentlemen , might i remind you
that caffrey has a four @-@ hour head start ?
caffrey came out of the e @-@ block staff bathroom dressed as a guard .
where &apos;d he get the uniform ?
uniform supply company on the internet .
he used a credit card ?
he used my wife &apos;s american express .
we &apos;re tracing the number in case he uses it again .
he won &apos;t .
how did he get the key cards for the gate ?
we think he restriped a utility card ,
using the record head on that .
you should have given him a cd player .
he walked out the front door ,
hot @-@ wired a maintenance truck in the parking lot .
we found it abandoned near the airport .
we beefed up security just in case he tries to get out that way .
we &apos;re not gonna catch caffrey using roadblocks and wanted posters .
he shaved his beard just before he escaped .
neal doesn &apos;t have a beard .
the inmates are photographed each morning as they exit their cells .
i hardly recognize him .
i think that &apos;s the point .
this morning ?
yes .
run the series back .
stop .
that &apos;s it-- when he stopped shaving .
i want to know everything that happened that day .
he had a visitor .
kate moreau . you know her ?
yeah . i do .
no audio ?
no .
she comes back every week like clockwork .
she &apos;s not thrilled about this visit .
how soon can we get a lip @-@ reader in here ?
i &apos;ll save you the trouble .
&quot; adios , neal . it &apos;s been real . &quot;
did she come back next week ?
she never came back .
okay . let &apos;s find kate .
i see kate moved out .
she leave you a message in that ?
the bottle is the message .
it &apos;s been a while .
yeah .
a few years , give or take .
you carrying ?
you know i don &apos;t like guns .
they ask me , what makes a guy like you
pull a boneheaded escape with four months to go ?
i guess you figured it out .
kate says &quot; adios &quot; to you at prison ,
then gets busy with her disappearing act .
her trail ends here .
but you already know that .
i missed her by two days .
still ... it only took you a month and a half to escape a supermax .
damn impressive .
all clear . subject identifiedand unarmed .
roger that .
are we surrounded ? how many ?
including my agents and the marshals ?
all of them , i think .
what &apos;s the message ?
&quot; goodbye . &quot;
women .
they &apos;re gonna give you another four years for this , you know .
i don &apos;t care .
that &apos;s the same suit you were wearing the last time you arrested me .
classics never go out of style .
you know what this is ?
no idea .
i got it from a case i was supposed to be working on
before they yanked me off to find you .
you think you &apos;ll catch him ?
don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s good .
maybe as good as you .
what &apos;s it worth if i tell you what this is ?
is it worth a meeting ?
what are you talking about ?
if i tell you what this is right now ,
will you agree to meet me back in prison in one week ?
just a meeting .
okay .
it &apos;s a security fiber for the new canadian $ 100 bill .
put your hands where i can see them .
let &apos;s go .
one week .
got him .
what &apos;s got the belt @-@ and @-@ suspender boys all riled up ?
you .
me ? what &apos;d i do ?
caffrey was right .
that stuff from the bank vault--
security fibersfor the new canadian 100 .
i &apos;ll be damned .
apparently , the formulation is still classified .
the canadian secret service is very curious to know
how you figured it out .
this should be fun .
you may have started an international incident .
how did you know ?
come on , peter .
it &apos;s what i do .
how upset were the canadians ?
oh , very .
well , as upset as canadians can get .
all right , so , i agreed to a meeting . we &apos;re meeting .
i know why you call him the dutchman .
like the ghost ship , he disappears whenever you get close .
how do you know anything about him ?
you know my life . you don &apos;t think i know yours ?
did you get the birthday cards ?
nice touch .
you &apos;ve been after the dutchman
almost as long as you were after me .
i &apos;ll help you catch him .
really ? really ? how @-@ how does that work ?
you want to be prison pen pals ?
you can get me out of here .
there &apos;s case law , precedent .
i can be released into your custody .
nice . this is.this is very nice .
but you &apos;re right . i do know you .
and i know the second you &apos;re out , you &apos;ll take off after kate .
peter ... i am not gonna run .
gps tracking anklet .
the new ones are tamper @-@ proof , never been skipped on .
there &apos;s always a first time .
think about it .
sorry , neal . nice try .
lights out , bobby . shut &apos;em down .
neal , you got to turn that off .
get one more minute , bobby ?
okay , one more minute .
is it midnight yet ?
yeah , it &apos;s midnight .
shut up , bitch !
you coming to bed tonight ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
oh , don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s neal caffrey .
i &apos;ve been competing with him for three years .
he &apos;d be out today .
you considering his offer ?
of course you are , or you &apos;d be in bed with me .
can he help you find him ?
neal &apos;s smart .
you know how much i like smart .
is he as smart as those ivy league co @-@ eds they throw at you ?
he &apos;s almost as brilliantas the woman i married .
ooh , good answer .
so , what &apos;s the problem ?
this is not the way it &apos;s supposed to go .
you get caught , you do your time .
there &apos;s more to this - more to this than some lost love .
some side angle he &apos;s playing .
so you &apos;re suggesting he escapes a maximum @-@ security prison ,
knowing full well that you &apos;d catch him
just so he could trick you into letting him out again ?
it &apos;s a working theory .
yeah . keep working .
is it so hard for you to believe
a man would do that for the woman he loves ?
neal just bought himself four more years in prison . for what ?
&quot; for what &quot; ?
if you were neal , you wouldn &apos;t have run for me ?
let me see it .
you understand how this works ?
yeah , i &apos;m being released into the custody of the fbi
under your supervision .
i let this thing chafe my leg . anything i &apos;m missing ?
yeah . if you run and i catch you ,
which you know i will because i &apos;m 2 @-@ 0,
you &apos;re not back here for four years .
you &apos;re back here for good .
you &apos;re gonna be tempted to look for kate . don &apos;t .
i told you --the bottle meant &quot; goodbye . &quot;
then leave it at that .
this is a temporary situation .
help me catch the dutchman , we can make it permanent .
where are we headed ?
your new home .
this is neal caffrey . my office called earlier .
there you go ... snake eyes .
thank you .
can i talk to you for a second ?
hang on . a little farther down .
do i have to stay here ?
cowboy up , all right ?
it cost $ 700 a month to house you on the inside
so that &apos;s what it costs here .
for the money , this is as good as it gets .
you find something better , take it .
what about clothes ? i &apos;m wearing my entire wardrobe .
you like thrift stores .
there &apos;s one at the end of the block .
no , don &apos;t start . no protests . this is what you wanted , isn &apos;t it ? huh ?
look it . it &apos;s ni--oh , look at her .
you don &apos;t get that in prison , do you ? no , not at all .
listen , your tracking ankletis set up
so that you can go anywhere within 2 miles of this place .
here &apos;s your homework .
remember- 2 miles .
i &apos;ll see you at 7 : 00 a.m.
i &apos;ve come to donate these .
men &apos;s suits .
those are fantastic .
they belonged to my late husband - byron .
he really did have great taste in clothes .
may i ? thank you .
this is a devore .
yes . he won it from sy himself .
won it ?
he beat him at a backdoor draw .
your husband played poker with sy devore ?
he certainly did . and so did i.
no .
yes .
the guys would even let me sit in once in a while on a hand .
and i was good .
i &apos; m glad to see you appreciate these .
i was hoping someone would .
i &apos;ve got a whole closet full of them .
a whole closet ?
well , actually , it &apos;s a guest room ,
but , uh , but i haven &apos;t used it for anything except storage for years .
byron used to wear that one whenever we went dancing .
the neighborhood was ... let &apos;s say it was much nicer then .
you live nearby ?
not far .
i &apos;m here for caffrey , room 11 .
oh , yeah , yeah .
snake eyes .
nice guy .
left you a note .
河滨大道87号 吻你抱你 尼尔
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
good day .
thank you .
i think i have the wrong address .
you must be peter .
i &apos;m looking for neal caffrey .
he &apos;s upstairs .
you &apos;re early .
we &apos;re shagging a lead at the airport .
we got a hit on &quot; snow white . &quot;
&quot; snow white . &quot;
the phrase you decoded from a suspected dutchman communicator
to barcelona .
you moved .
yeah . it &apos;s nicer than the otherplace , don &apos;t you think ?
yeah . i don &apos;t rememberthe other place having a view .
i went to the thrift store , like you suggested .
and june ...
lady with the dog . we met .
... was donating her late husband &apos;s clothes .
we hit it off . she had an extra guest room .
you said if i found a nicerplace for the same price , i should take it .
i did say that .
all this for $ 700 ?
yep . but i help out around the place .
oh , sure . feed the dog .
yeah . wash the jag .
watch her granddaughter from time to time .
she &apos;s got you babysitting ?
how &apos;s it going ?
morning , neal .
granddaughter ?
she &apos;s an art student .
unbelievable .
go get dressed .
you mind ?
hey , grandma .
good morning , cindy .
it &apos;s perfect .
even the freakin &apos; coffee is perfect .
that &apos;s not jewelry on his ankle , you know .
he &apos;s a felon .
so was byron .
you look like a cartoon .
this is classic rat pack .
this is a devore .
sorry , dino .
will you stop with the hat ?
come on . let &apos;s go .
you &apos;re upset .
sour grapes .
what was that ?
look , you tell me which rule i broke ,
and i will thumb it back to prison myself .
for starters ...
i work hard . i do my job well .
and i don &apos;t have a $ 10 million view of manhattan
that is share with a 22 @-@ year @-@ old art student
while we sip espresso .
why not ?
why not ? because i &apos;m not supposed to .
the amount of work i do equals certain things in the real world .
not cappuccino in the clouds .
look , i will find out
where june buys her coffee if it &apos;s that important to you .
it &apos;s not about the coffee .
i think it is .
no , it &apos;s not .
this is what gets you into trouble .
this is the start of those something @-@ for @-@ nothing schemes
that lead to the frauds that got you locked up .
i think it &apos;s some sort of italian roast .
get in the car .
who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s diana .
diana is my probie .
probie ?
probationary agent .
she does everything i don &apos;t .
she &apos;s very good at her job , and she can do way better than you .
you must be neal caffrey .
nice hat .
what have we got ?
his name &apos;s tony field .
customs flagged him coming in from spain
in response to our snow white bolo .
customs playing nice ?
the usual chest @-@ pounding . he &apos;s in their custody , not ours .
less paperwork for me . what &apos;s he carrying ?
oh , you &apos;re gonna love this .
&quot; blanca nieves y los siete enanos &quot; ?
snow white and her seven little men .
this is what triggered our alert ?
what do we know about this guy ?
says he &apos;s a rare @-@ book dealer .
anything wrong with his paperwork ?
no.he brought in the same books in the same quantity on three previous trips .
he declared them each time .
all right , dino . are we wasting our time ?
they &apos;re not limited runs or special editions . can &apos;t be worth much .
so why go to all the trouble of flying them in ?
good question .
he sure is nervous for having all the right paperwork .
i want to talk to him .
i &apos;ll set it up .
hey , boss , i &apos;m grabbing some coffee.you want some ?
yeah . anything but decaf .
diana , i &apos;ll take mine straight .
neal , the coffee shop &apos;s outside .
you are way out of your league .
oh , harmless flirting . it &apos;s like a dance .
ah , there is no dance .
you &apos;re not even on her dance card .
no dancing for you .
um , she digs the hat .
um , she &apos;d rather be wearing the hat .
peter burke , fbi .
fbi ?
oh , they &apos;re really kicking it up a notch .
so , you &apos;re a book dealer .
yes . well , as i have told everyone here ,
repeatedly , my business is the import and sale of rare books .
how rare can they be ? you &apos;ve got 600 of them .
would you like me to go to the crime lab ?
help you dust for fingerprints ?
i get it . &apos; cause i &apos;m telling you how to do your job .
so , snow white
in spanish ?
snow white was not created by disney , detective .
there are a few stories
that predate steamboat willie .
i &apos;m a federal agent .
and you mean folklore of the virginally pure queen ?
like alexander pushkin &apos;s
&quot; tale of the white princess and the seven knights &quot; ?
is that what you mean ?
what are the books for ?
i &apos;d appreciate it if you didn &apos;t talk to my client .
constitution and all ?
were you chasing the ambulance , or did they give you a ride ?
huh ? you must have thumbed it .
no dance , huh ?
not for you .
i thought the fbi had a policy .
that &apos;s the military . we don &apos;t ask . we don &apos;t care .
where &apos;s the customs inspector ?
neal was right.the books aren &apos;t worth much .
you could pick them up for a few dollars on ebay .
hey , why didn &apos;t you tell me the guy lawyered up ?
the second he makes that call , i can &apos;t talk to him .
he didn &apos;t call anybody .
then how did his lawyer know that ...
i need paramedics in here now !
nobody frisked the lawyer ? !
god !
we &apos;ve got a dead book dealer ,
a killer lawyer , and a bunch of worthless books .
all right . come on .
as a reformed professional counterfeiter ,
what is the dutchman &apos;s interest in these ?
published 1944 in madrid . this is what he &apos;s after .
the top sheet ?
more than that . this is a piece of 1944 spanish press parchment .
that &apos;s what he wanted . good . this is good .
he &apos;s gonna counterfeit something that was originally printed on paper like that ?
that &apos;s what i would do .
tony made three prior shipments with these .
two blank pages per book is 600 sheets .
too many for paintings , not enough for currency .
i bet our deadbook dealer knew .
diana , where &apos;s that wallet ?
it &apos;s right here .
this is where he went the day before he left for spain .
yeah , i do remember him .
he came by several months ago and then again last week .
this is what he came to see .
the spanish victory bond .
he took several photographs of it .
said he was gonna write a book . it &apos;s a shame he &apos;s dead .
this bond does have a fascinating history .
it &apos;s a goya .
yes . beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , look at that .
a perfect fit .
you &apos;re starting to earn your $ 700 a month .
you said it had a fascinating history .
quite . it was issued during the war .
1944 .
yes .
yeah , the u.s. issued it to support
the spanish underground in their battle against the axis .
very few have ever been redeemed .
there &apos;s speculation that entire boxes were captured
and many of them are still hidden away in the caves of altamira .
whole boxes of these ?
yeah .
boy , that would be something , wouldn &apos;t it ?
this is the only surviving copy .
except it &apos;s a forgery .
no . that &apos;s not possible .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s the ink . this is iron @-@ gall dye mixed
to match period colors , but it hasn &apos;t dried yet .
you can still smell the gum arabic .
uh , no . this has been here since 1952 .
it &apos;s been here less than a week .
okay . tony makes two trips .
the first time , he takes a picture of the bond .
his second trip in , he steals the original
and replaces it with this copy .
can we confirm that ?
the time ink identification test puts the age of the bond
at approximately six days , which coincides with tony &apos;s visit .
we &apos;re pulling surveillance video to back it up .
good . so the question is why go to the
trouble of making a really nice forgery
on the right kind of paper
just to stick it back in the archives ?
is the bond still negotiable ?
it &apos;s a zero option , so it never expires .
what &apos;s it worth ?
$ 1,000 face value .
drawing 9 % interest .
compounded for 64 years .
$ 248,000
what he said .
quarter of a million . not chump change .
and he &apos;s got 600 sheets of the stuff .
$ 150 million . give or take .
he &apos;d be a rich man if he could pass them off .
but it still doesn &apos;t tell us why he would
take out the real bond and put in a forgery .
i think it does .
what if he claimed he found boxes of the original bonds ?
dragged them out of those caves in spain .
yeah . how would they be authenticated ?
they &apos;d be taken to the archives
and compared to the original .
which he &apos;s already switched out with one of his own copies .
so of course they &apos;re gonna match .
oh , this is good . this is really good .
all right . let &apos;s think about this .
it &apos;s elizabeth .
would you believe me if i said i was
pulling upright in front of the house now ?
you lost track of time . it happens .
i hope you didn &apos;t make dinner .
did you forget who you married ?
i am smarter than that .
so , how &apos;s neal doing ? satchmo .
he met diana .
oh , a woman who can resist his charms .
bet that &apos;s taking some getting used to .
is he helping ?
we &apos;re onto something here , el .
so i won &apos;t wait up .
i &apos;m leaving . 10 minutes . i promise .
20 at the most .
i know .
bye .
chew your food .
you sound like your father .
big plans for the weekend ?
uh , you know , i got to fix the sink , catch the game .
with elizabeth ?
yeah . yeah , she &apos;s into it .
how cool is that ?
she likes to watch the giants .
even on your anniversary ?
i see this stuff coming from six months out
and then i take it right in the teeth every time .
relax , man . you still have a few days .
no . this is what happened last year .
i said i &apos;d make up for it with something special
not just a corner booth at donatella &apos;s
and a romp in the sheets .
skip the dinner .
we &apos;ve been married a decade .
that doesn &apos;t cut it anymore .
okay , romeo , let &apos;s , let &apos;s problem solve .
what &apos;s she into ?
sexually ?
no . no . existentially .
what makes her feel alive ?
i &apos;m drawing a blank .
how could you not know ?
when you were chasing me , you knew my shoe size
what time i woke up in the morning .
that &apos;s the job . very different .
so , a relationship isn &apos;t work ?
oh , no , no .
you don &apos;t get to lecture me on relationships .
my wife didn &apos;t change her identity
and flee the country to get away from me .
yes , yes , yes .
that was harsh . i didn &apos;t . i didn &apos;t mean that .
yeah , you did .
did she really flee the country ?
i don &apos;t know .
france ? did she go to france ?
i don &apos;t know .
what am i gonna do ?
no .
no more relationship advice from this side of the car .
call dr.phil , okay ?
i saw the best mind of my generation get
run downby the drunken taxicab of absolute reality .
what the hell , mozzie ?
sitting in the dark , misquoting ginsberg ?
the light &apos;s . how they find you , man .
hey , you know .
you can &apos;t just help yourself here .
how &apos;d you get in ?
i used this .
i knocked .
i introduced myself to june . she &apos;s great .
did you get a load of that granddaughter ?
thanks for coming .
what was i gonna do , not come ?
can i see ?
can you pick it ?
no way . no way .
you flew too close to the sun , my friend .
they burned your wings .
where &apos;s kate , moz ?
where &apos;d she go ?
she &apos;s a ghost , man .
she did an outstanding job of melting away .
well , keep looking .
check france .
france ?
i know , okay ? it &apos;s probably nothing .
just ... look everywhere .
there &apos;s something else .
i need you to help me figure out
who created this .
it &apos;s superb .
you know the worst thing about art forgery ?
you can &apos;t take credit for your work .
el ?
honey ?
what do you like ?
what &apos;s special ?
look at you . you haven &apos;t changed . i have changed .
yeah ? this is burke .
it &apos;s jones . caffrey &apos;s anklet activated .
is he with you ?
no . i &apos;m coming .
el , i &apos;ve got to go . neal &apos;s outside his radius
agent burke , are you still there ?
caffrey is with me .
are you sure ?
yeah , yeah .
good morning , honey .
peter .
you &apos;re on my couch ?
yeah , i came to talk to you .
and , uh , frankly , peter , i have to say
i &apos;m surprised you have such an amazing wife .
yeah , i like her . get off my couch .
honey , we &apos;re just chatting .
chatting ?
how did you get here ?
cab .
you activated your tracker .
you &apos;re in my house on my couch with my wife .
oh , hey , satchmo .
now you &apos;re petting my dog .
did you really put elizabeth under surveillance
before you asked her out ?
peter , i underestimated you .
you told him ?
he said he wanted to make sure that
i wasn &apos;t seeing anybody else .
honey , i think it &apos;s cute .
i think it &apos;s adorable .
i &apos;m putting you back in prison .
i know who the dutchman is .
enlighten me .
curtis hagen .
he &apos;s an art restorer one of the best in the world
but his own work never took off .
he &apos;s particularly good at goya restorations .
that &apos;s what this is , peter .
the bond is him showing off .
interesting theory . how do you prove it ?
he signed it .
i think we might have noticed
a signature tucked in the corner .
show him .
look at the pants on the spanish peasant .
what do you see ?
it &apos;s the initials &quot; c &quot; and &quot; h. &quot;
i don &apos;t know . that &apos;s , that &apos;s a stretch .
this bond is a masterpiece .
if i &apos;d done something this good ,
i would have signed it .
the forgeries you caught me on ,
i signed them .
where ?
look at the bank seal under polarized light sometime .
hagen is doing a church restoration on third street .
we can stop by on our way in .
fine .
meet me in the car .
i &apos;m gonna say goodbye to my wife now .
yes .
it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you after all these years .
this is it ?
yep .
you can &apos;t come in . we &apos;re closed for restoration .
sorry , father .
could we just -- could we just have a moment ? thank you .
father ...
please , father . my best friend is having a crisis of the soul .
he &apos;s a married man .
and he has the most devastatingly beautiful assistant at work
a very provocative woman .
he &apos;s been tempted .
more than tempted . i have details .
it &apos;s very common with men his age .
unfortunately , very common .
and i want to confront him about this
before he tears apart his life .
he has a lot of faults .
i mean , don &apos;t get me started . he is a mess .
but he &apos;s very spiritual .
i know this is the place where my words will have the most effect .
this is the city of churches .
we &apos;re closed . surely , there &apos;s another place .
this is where he was married .
five minutes .
oh , thank you. thank you , father .
sorry about that . we got five .
did you just lie to a priest ?
do you think diana &apos;s attractive ?
sure .
then we &apos;re good .
extraordinary .
real nice .
so , if this hagen ... guy is as good as you say ...
how come i &apos;ve never heard of him ?
you only know the guys who get caught .
you know the second @-@ best criminals .

can i help you , gentlemen ?
your face --it &apos;s familiar .
maybe i &apos;ve seen it on the news or perhaps on a &quot; most wanted &quot; webpage ?
neal caffrey .
forgive me if i don &apos;t shake hands with an art thief .
i was never arrested for art theft .
not arrested ,
but , as i recall ,
you &apos;re known as quite the renaissance criminal .
so you can understand my concern at having you in my space .
and you are ... ?
just a friend .
well , friend ... this church is closed .
did you see it ?
okay , you &apos;ve got me curious .
we &apos;ll check him out .
listen to the spirit , son . not the flash .
i &apos;ll do that .
what &apos;s ... that about ?
shut the door .
i need your help with this .
is this the information on hagen ?
no . diana &apos;s on her way with that .
this is your wife &apos;s visa bill .
yeah . i got it all .
her ebay bids ,
video rentals , library books .
thank you , patriot act .
so you &apos;re stalking your own wife ?
want to compare notes ?
appreciate .
you figure out what she likes ?
yep . it &apos;s all in the summary .
pottery @-@ making .
nancy drew mysteries .
scented candles .
oleander .
old jazz .
anything italian , except anchovies .
yeah , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna find your answer
tucked into a list of her ebay bids .
then help me out here , all right ? you &apos;re the romantic .
i mean , what &apos;s the deal with the bottle ?
it &apos;s an &apos; 82 bordeaux .
yeah . costs 800 bucks a pop .
it does when it &apos;s full . i got it empty .
empty ?
look , when kate and i met , we had nothing .
i got that bottle ,
and i used to fill it up with whatever cheap wine we could afford .
and we &apos;d sit in that crappy apartment
and drink it over cold pizza
and pretend we were living in the cote d &apos;azur .
how &apos;d that work out for you ?
it didn &apos;t .
&apos;cause that bottle was a promise of a better life .
what kate got was a guy
locked away for half a decade .
you make elizabeth any promises , peter ?
or you think what she really wants is oleander candles ?
hey , diana . what do you got ?
hagen is leaving the country .
he booked a flight through a private charter company
in barcelona for the 19th .
one week . damn it , neal .
seeing you must have tipped him off .
he &apos;s going to spain . that &apos;s something .
is there any connection to our books and the bonds or the murder ?
hagen &apos;s impressive as hell .
a lot of international holdings , but he keeps himself out of the muck .
you get every available agent on this .
you know the good ones . steal them if you have to .
i want to know every single thing about this guy , and i don &apos;t want any excuses .
anything gets in your way ...
forge your signature .
always do .
that &apos;s what i want to hear .
if you &apos;re right about hagen ,
we have one week to connect him to the bond .
if we lose him on the 19th ...
neal , if we lose him , you &apos;re back in .
i can &apos;t save you .
you &apos;re late .
hey , give me a break .
i &apos;m a working man now .
so ?
we were right about hagen .
of course we were right .
and i was stupid and impulsive , and he saw me .
i have one week to link him to the bonds .
one week or what ?
i go back .
no , no , no , no .
yeah .
did you find anything about kate ?
apparently , if a tree falls in the forest , it does make a sound .
i may lose her again , moz .
lose her ? i just found her .
so did he .
so did he .
remember when you told me not to look for kate ?
yeah .
neal , you &apos;re putting me in a tough spot here .
these were taken four days ago at a san diego atm .
she &apos;s going under the name kate perdue .
you know what &quot; perdue &quot; means in french ?
yeah . it means lost .
yeah . makes you wonder , right ?
is she lost to me or without me ?
stop it .
i just needa couple days , okay ?
a @-@ after this dutchman thing is over . a couple days to go to san diego .
you could send an agent with me . you can come with me .
stop . stop . stop it !
how many times are you gonna screw up your life for this girl ?
i hate to break it to you ,
buddy , but she dumped you -- with prejudice .
exactly what is your plan if you find her ?
i know there &apos;s more to our story , okay ?
she disappears in the dust --no , that &apos;s not an ending .
come on , man .
we &apos;ve all been there .
it gets easier .
not if she &apos;s the one .
i brought this to you.doesn &apos;t that count for something ?
no .
we made a deal .
i gave you something good here , and you &apos;re about to blow it .
god .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right , peter .
i &apos;m a smart guy .
i should know when i &apos;ve been dumped .
you figure out your anniversary plans yet ?
i &apos;m getting close--very close .
so you got nothing ?
nothing . but i &apos;ll find it .
hey , um ... i &apos;m gonna go grab a smoke , really quick .
didn &apos;t know you smoked .
ah , it &apos;s a nasty prison habit . i &apos;ve been trying to quit .
jones , keep an eye on him .
yeah .
bum one from you ?
these things will kill you .
that &apos;s what i keep hearing , but i &apos;m not dead yet .
but these filters--they &apos;re good .
not for me , you understand .
i tear &apos; em off .
you need a light ?
you should try the patch .
two years and counting , my friend .
i hate the tan lines .
you don &apos;t smoke .
what was i supposed to do --fire off a flare ?
so , you tear off the filter ?
yeah . but i &apos;m hard @-@ core .
i found my bottle .
i found hagen .
you first .
this is a warehouse down by the docks .
hagen runs it through a shell corporation out of guatemala .
we didn &apos;t know about this . how did you ?
i don &apos;t think you rely on rumoras much as i do .
let &apos;s go .
do you hear that ? you hear that ?
hear what ?
kind of rhythmic &quot; ssh , ssh .
that &apos;s a press . damn it , peter . that is a printing press .
he &apos;s printing the bonds in there right now . you can hear it .
how long till they &apos;re done ?
a multicolor print job as complicated as the goya --
test proofs , ink formulation , perfect registration --
he &apos;ll be running it for days .
diana .
yeah , boss .
i need recording equipmentdown here immediately .
you got it .
come on .
i am on board .
hagen is our guy .
but we still don &apos;t have enough for a warrant .
we know the bonds are there . just open the door .
yeah .
well , you should read this -- &quot; warrant law . &quot;
all i &apos;ve got is sound coming out of a warehouse
and no way to link him to the bond .
i &apos;ve got to talk to your friend .
friend ?
come on , neal . the guy who gave you a cigarette .
i have no -- what -- you think jones is an idiot ?
i have to know how he connected hagen to the warehouse .
come on , neal . and you got to trust me .
okay . okay .
i &apos;ll bring you to him--first thing tomorrow .
good .
yeah ?
damn .
what &apos;s going on ?
he ran .
hi , there .
what are you doing ? you can &apos;t be here .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m taking a photography class over at the annex
and pictures of rusty sheet metal are a surefire &quot; a.
take him in .
jimmy ! go get hagen !
what exactly is going on here ? !
why &apos;d you bring him inside ? !
he was taking pictures .
open the door ! you &apos;re a dead man !
that sounds like inch @-@ thick lexan .
keys are on their way .
nice .
you shouldn &apos;t have signed the bonds .
i &apos;m no stranger to vanity myself , so i understand the impulse .
i &apos;m gonna kill you .
i hope whatever they &apos;re giving you is worth it .
it is .
you are a particular kind of bastard !
gentlemen , we have a fugitive hiding in this building .
knock down those doors .
grab the bonds ! come on ! let &apos;s go ! everybody , come on !
quick ! let &apos;s go ! move it !
come on ! let &apos;s go !
get in there !
do not move !
get them up in the air !
this is what the law calls an exigent circumstance .
any of you harvard grads know what that is ? huh ?
no hands ?
diana ?
exigent circumstance allows us
to pursue a suspect onto private property
without obtaining a warrant .
and to seize any and all evidence
that has been discovered in plain view ,
regardless of the connection to the original crime .
remember me , friend ?
oh , there &apos;s your lawyer .
you know , you &apos;re really bad at this escape thing .
what can i say ?
cigar ?
cuban ?
you should arrest me .
i &apos;ll let the cigar go , but you are a fleeing suspect .
is that the original victory bond ?
why , yes .
yes , it is .
you know , this makes me 3 @-@ 0 .
maybe i &apos;m not trying hard enough .
now , i want you to keep your eyes closed .
i promise .
all right .
okay . open them .
honey , you know how every year , i &apos;m always promising you
that we &apos;re gonna go ...
to the caribbean .
this sort of what you wanted ?
well , i think if i keep my eyes closed ,
i can actually imagine us being there .
ooh , and it &apos;s getting warmer .
it is .
come here .
okay
screw top .
cheesy ?
it &apos;s a little cheesy , but it &apos;s ... but it &apos;s sweet .
maybe this will help .
belize .
what ? !
i found the time .
we have a week and two plane tickets
and a seized villain sarteneja .
in --in where ?
oh , in this really incredible beach front villa
that the bureau seized from this narcotrafficker .
it &apos;s amazing -okay . it &apos;s -- enough .
just ... just tell me it &apos;s nice .
it &apos;s nice .
i love you .
i love you .
thank you .
thank you .

coffee ?
yeah . italian roast ?
going on vacation .
yeah .
yeah , we &apos;ll be back in a week .
still wearing that suit .
yeah . i love this suit .

figured if we didn &apos;t , you &apos;d end up making one of these on your own .
i &apos;m official .
you &apos;re a consultant , and i own you for four years .
you okay with that ?
yeah .
you &apos;ll be here when i get back ?
