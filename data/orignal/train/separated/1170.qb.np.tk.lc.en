holden , that &apos;s a serious bruise .
the ulcer &apos;s completely under control .
i &apos;m totally okay to swim again .
it &apos;s not my call . i have to talk to the principal .
looks like somebody made a new friend .
didn &apos;t expect to see those two hooking up .
jason &apos;s parents begged me
to change the date on the former will .
they didn &apos;t want their son
to look like the number one suspect .
i &apos;ve seen ali with dark hair before .
i &apos;m pretending to be someone else .
maybe ali found a way to fly under his radar .
by being someone else ?
brunette on the i.d.
&quot; vivian darkbloom &quot; is a pseudonym
for vladimir nabokov .
you didn &apos;t just send it to us .
you sent it to everybody in your address book .
i didn &apos;t do this !
mrs. marin ?
yes .
yes .
that &apos;s what you got from ali &apos;s claim ticket ?
that &apos;s what they gave me .
so , basically , you picked up her dry cleaning .
i just can &apos;t ever picture alison wearing this .
well , picture vivian darkbloom .
so now we &apos;re saying
this vivian darkperson had her own wardrobe too ?
this is so weird .
can i touch it ?
yeah , it &apos;s a raincoat , aria , it &apos;s not a mummy .
where &apos;s hanna ?
she and her mom had to meet with tamborelli before school .
yeah . kate &apos;s mom printed out that naked picture
and she &apos;s threatening to sue .
she wants blood .
hanna &apos;s . yeah .
probably mine too .
i &apos;m the one who told her
that kate used to be called &quot; boil n &apos; baggies . &quot;
who told &quot; a &quot; ?
who tells &quot; a &quot; anything ?
that plan was probably in motion
the moment kate walked into school .
guys , check it out .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a phone number .
whose ?
uh ... there &apos;s no name .
let &apos;s call it .
okay , stop .
now i feel like we &apos;re in a bad place .
we &apos;re in my living room , emily . we are holding a coat .
yeah , that belongs to someone who &apos;s no longer alive .
em . how can we not call this ?
okay , whoever this is may have some answers ,
like why on earth did alison need to be this vivian person ?
yeah , and who was vivian meeting , and why ?
you think we &apos;re gonna find that out from a number in a pocket ?
well , it &apos;s probably easier than
hiring the fat lady with the tube top at the farmer &apos;s market
who &apos;s gonna tell you your fortune ,
but if you &apos;re too scared--
i &apos;m not scared !
yeah , i don &apos;t know about our fortunes ...
but that lady with the tube top makes really good apple butter .
hello ?
&apos;kay , what if we know this person ?
what am i supposed to say ?
the mobile subscriber at 215 ...
it went to voicemail .
man or woman ?
it &apos;s a computer .
... is unavailable .
give it to me . just ... !
hi , um ... this is a friend of vivian &apos;s .
can you just give me a call back on this number today ?
it &apos;s really important . thanks .
i know that teenagers make mistakes .
it &apos;s their biological mandate to screw up .
this was no mistake ! this was intentional !
she set out to sabotage my daughter
in her first week of school .
hanna said she didn &apos;t do it , and i believe her .
oh , really ? then who did ?
it was sent from her phone !
hanna &apos;s resume speaks for itself .
she is malicious , she is resentful ,
and i want to see her punished for this .
and she will be .
rosewood high has a zero tolerance policy for bullying ,
and sending a photo like this is a very serious offense .
she will not be let off the hook .
she &apos;s been off the hook for some time .
there &apos;s no guidance .
her mother is never home .
her mother is a divorced woman who works full time
because her husband left her for you !
ladies , ladies , look .
under normal circumstances , she would be expelled for this .
however , given the unusual circumstances here ,
i think everyone here would
be better served by a different approach .
being expelled works for me .
what were you going to suggest , mr. tamborelli ?
until the school board figures out
how they &apos;re gonna handle this ,
i want you ladies to work through it .
so in tomorrow &apos;s event ,
you &apos;re gonna be put in the same group .
what event ? what is this ?
our school sponsors &quot; truth up &quot; day .
it &apos;s a guided workshop .
the goal is to break barriers ,
forge new connections ,
and own up to bad behavior .
everyone who participates stays overnight .
and this is supervised by ... ?
teachers and parents .
would either of you care to volunteer ?
i &apos;ll be there .
good .
well , you &apos;ll be expected to bring a sleeping bag ,
a toothbrush , and a change in attitude .
wait . they still think you sent that picture ?
yep .
at least you weren &apos;t suspended , han .
this is gonna blow over .
yeah , until &quot; a &quot; gets hungry again
and takes another bite out of my ass .
hanna .
no . we thought we had all the power
because we had &quot; a &apos;s &quot; phone .
well , guess what-- now &quot; a &apos;s &quot; using
our phones against us .
guess it could have been a lot worse , right ?
tamborelli &apos;s a jerk .
hit the wall with him last week .
wait , is he the one who &apos;s keeping you off the swim team ?
totally . i found he &apos;s got some major sponsor on the hook .
and doesn &apos;t want anyone in the pool
who might tarnish the team &apos;s image .
what ? ! god , talk about bullies !
how much longer are we gonna have to pay
for picking up that stupid shovel ?
what &apos;s everybody doing ?
uh , some kind of project for &quot; truth up &quot; day .
wanna help ?
sure .
so , how &apos;s that bruise doing ?
fine .
help me with this , would you ?
um ... it only works if you pull on the end .
it &apos;s not really fair , you know .
i agree . next they &apos;ll be asking us to paint the school .
i &apos;m talking about our arrangement .
how come you get to know who i &apos;m meeting ,
but i don &apos;t get to know who you &apos;re meeting ?
because that &apos;s our arrangement .
you know enough .
okay .
i &apos;ll go get some thumbtacks .
i &apos;ll be right back .
spencer ?
what are you doing here ?
just had to drop off some old forms--
kids that i counseled after school .
were you out of town ?
yeah , yeah . georgia .
we &apos;re still trying to fix up my grandmother &apos;s house .
it needs a little work .
hey , can you , uh , do me a favor ?
um , what do you need ?
give your father a message for me .
tell him he owes me a call .
why ?
just give him the message .
i &apos;m back , and he can &apos;t keep dodging me .
jason !
hey , jason , sorry to interrupt .
that &apos;s okay . we were done .
how you doing , ella ?
frazzled .
i volunteered to recruit supervisors for tomorrow &apos;s event ,
and i am still short on staff .
are you by any chance free ?
i don &apos;t think so .
well , it was worth a try .
please tell me your parents are still onboard ,
because i need bodies .
yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure .
what &apos;s the event ?
maybe , uh ... maybe i can be there .
really ?
well , yeah . i mean ...
you know , if you &apos;re desperate enough to ask me ,
then , sure , count me in .
come in .
doing your homework ?
yeah . what &apos;s up ?
i was just reading some material on this &quot; truth up &quot; day .
figure if i &apos;m going to supervise , i ...
you really don &apos;t have to go . i mean , it sounds pathetic .
no , i want to go .
i need some answers myself .
hanna , i don &apos;t care what it says on your driver &apos;s license .
to me , you are still my baby girl ,
and ... i will crush anyone who tries to hurt you .
you know that , right ?
maybe i &apos;ve made some mistakes ,
cleaning up your messes ...
mom .
... not forcing you to talk
because i wanted to respect your privacy .
stop .
we don &apos;t have to talk about this .
yes , we do .
this is not the first time
you &apos;ve told me someone framed you .
who would do that ?
why can &apos;t you give me a name ?
there is no name .
hanna , you came very close
to getting kicked out of school this morning .
this is potentially a criminal charge .
who do you think sent that picture from your phone ?
look , i &apos;m stuck here .
i &apos;ve given you every opportunity to confide in me .
i &apos;m just gonna ask you , did you ...
send that picture out ?
i didn &apos;t do it .
you guys ,
tamborelli &apos;s telling kids to turn off their cell phones .
otherwise , he &apos;s gonna have to confiscate them .
they can &apos;t do that , can they ?
those are the rules .
turn off the digital spigot , or they will .
wait , what &apos;s a spigot ?
it &apos;s--
never mind . i really don &apos;t care .
are there any messages from that number in ali &apos;s coat ?
no .
pick a line . people , please ,
any line .
and it does not matter which one .
you will be given your group assignments ,
and they will tell you where to go ,
but , please , just pick a line .
what &apos;s up ?
hey . nothing .
must be weird to have your mom here .
if she patrols the halls at school and at home ,
i can see why you need to sneak out now and then .
hey . what happened to your voice ?
does this have something
to do with what fell out of my bag yesterday ?
did you tell your mother ?
no .
no , i would never do that .
that doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m okay with it , though .
okay with what ?
please don &apos;t make me say it out loud .
holden , if you are hooked on something , or if you &apos;re dealing--
whoa , whoa , whoa .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
no .
that bag wasn &apos;t filled with flintstones vitamins .
i &apos;m not stupid .
no , but you &apos;re way off .
we &apos;ve set up another table .
start a line over there .
hey , did you know she was gonna be in this group ?
no .
if i did , i would have given myself a fever this morning .
excuse me , where &apos;s 206 ?
right there .
jason . nice to see you .
are you part of this ?
yeah , this is my group .
i &apos;m helping out for the day . is peter here too ?
no , mr. hastings is out of town .
of course he is .
i &apos;m sorry ?
nothing . uh ... after you .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
what , you know that guy ?
yeah . it &apos;s alison &apos;s brother .
i can &apos;t do this .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve got a choice .
besides , with everybody spilling their guts today ,
some of us might have a lot to say .
i know i do .
okay .
take a step forward if you &apos;d rather not be here .
how about we skip this step and just jump out the window ?
let &apos;s start with a step .
&apos;cause i &apos;m sure some of you would rather not be here .
okay . take a step if you feel you &apos;ve ever been mistreated by
a student or a faculty member of this school .
um , emily , one step at a time .
take a step if you &apos;ve ever felt the school
was an unsafe or unwelcoming environment .
emily .
one step is not enough .
it &apos;s not safe or welcoming .
for some of us , it gets worse every day .
what do you mean by that ?
i used to enjoy going to school ,
being a part of a team and all that .
but now you make one mistake and you &apos;re tarnished ,
never to be trusted again .
emily , can i see you for a moment ?
okay , uh , take a step if you &apos;ve ever lied to your parents
about drinking alcohol .
if you &apos;re feeling unsafe and unwelcome ,
maybe it &apos;s because your behavior has made your teammates
and other students at this school feel the same way .
now , you &apos;re not helping your cause by attacking me .
i wasn &apos;t attack--
you &apos;re no saint , emily .
maybe it &apos;s time you take a look at what got you to this point .
... many of you are afraid to talk about things
that could bond you to strangers .
this exercise is about discovery .
discovering yourself and discovering your classmates .
sorry . forgot to turn it off .
i want to go back to my old school .
uh , hot tubs in the courtyard .
half day on fridays and no trig .
yeah . okay .
let &apos;s use this game to talk about what we could reasonably change .
a hot tub in the courtyard does not count .
now , kate , you mentioned liking your old school .
what do they have that we don &apos;t ?
nice people .
yes , well , we have some of those here ,
and i am sure you will find them .
is there anything else ?
i think students should have more of a say .
if someone &apos;s messed with you ,
you should be able to decide their punishment .
hey , now .
no .
what ?
toss me the ball .
i &apos;m just saying , if somebody pulled that kind of stunt
on me at a new school , i &apos;d go postal .
on the other hand ...
if i were you , i &apos;d rent a billboard .
noel , let &apos;s drop the bad boy act
and just get real .
bad boys got nothing on mean girls .
guys have a fight , there &apos;s a punch , it &apos;s over .
girls don &apos;t fight fair .
they gang up , they keep secrets , they plot .
they can cut you down with a look .
you know what ? give me the ball .
hanna !
no , it &apos;s my turn .
where does he get off calling other people out ?
he is the worst , smug , blackmailing son of a--
hanna !
miss montgomery ,
how long have you known me ?
do you think i &apos;m the person he &apos;s describing ?
am i a bully ?
you know what ? don &apos;t answer that
because i already know what everyone here thinks of me .
how was break ? did you see hanna ?
how &apos;s she doing ?
okay , i guess .
i mean , it &apos;s hard .
people really think she sent that picture .
people are toads .
mona , i know you heard what tamborelli said to me ,
and i &apos;m not proud of the stuff that went down
when alison was still here .
she treated you badly , and i ...
i let her .
i never tried to stop her ,
and i should have .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh , honey .
that was , like , two personalities ago .
i am so not holding on to that .
what gets me is how tamborelli is treating you .
he &apos;s toad of toad hall .
i mean , if you were a guy ,
you &apos;d already be back on the sharks .
what do you mean ?
do you have any idea how much slack he cuts for the football team ?
&quot; offensive line &quot; doesn &apos;t begin
to describe what they get away with .
how do you know this ?
i used to work in the vp &apos;s office during home room .
i know a lot ...
and you should , too .
okay , everyone , break &apos;s over .
feel free to write down anything you want .
it &apos;s anonymous .
jenna , if you need help , i can--
no , thank you . i &apos;ll pass .
well , i &apos;m sorry ,
but that &apos;s not really an option .
if you &apos;d prefer jason , he &apos;ll be back
in a few minutes with the flashlights ,
or if there &apos;s someone else you trust .
i don &apos;t trust anyone around here .
okay .
well , keep in mind that this day is about
opening up to new possibilities ,
and you &apos;ll be expected to--
to what ? to forgive all the classmates who &apos;ve mistreated me ?
i &apos;m not big on group hugs , mrs. hastings .
i don &apos;t need a special flashlight
to know what people around here are hiding .
this school &apos;s filled with phonies and liars .
they &apos;re everywhere .
in what way have you been mistreated ?
how much time have you got ?
oh , should i-- should i start with the day
that i was cornered in the girls &apos; bathroom and smacked ?
is she talking about hanna ?
did you ever report this ?
well , she couldn &apos;t .
wait ! caleb !
no because if she had , she would have to admit
that she threw the first punch .
isn &apos;t that right , jenna ?
so , just to clarify ,
we are telling the whole truth today , right ,
not just the part we want to remember ?
by the way , this is caleb speaking ,
in case you were confused .
jason !
i heard that you and my mom are leading a group .
how weird is that ?
yeah , it is .
i was hoping it would be your dad , though .
why ?
why is it so important that you talk to him ?
jason , look , i know about the will .
i know that my dad risked a lot to protect you ,
i just don &apos;t know why .
was there something that happened between our families ?
just talk to your dad when he gets back in town .
he &apos;s not out of town , and i &apos;ve already asked him .
he won &apos;t tell me .
caleb went after her ?
what did jenna do ?
nothing yet .
caleb thinks he knows who he &apos;s dealing with ,
and if hanna was worried about him before ...
where is hanna ?
i don &apos;t know .
no one called back .
what ?
the number from ali &apos;s coat .
well , we should have said we were vivian , not her friend .
that message would have been returned .
call back . say you &apos;re vivian .
well , i can &apos;t do it . he knows my voice . you do it .
me ? i don &apos;t even know what a vivian sounds like .
a lot like alison .
you know what ? give it to me . i &apos;ll do it .
hello ?
hello ?
uh , hi . hi . um ...
i @-@ i left a message yesterday .
i &apos;m a friend of vivian &apos;s .
yeah . who gave you this number ?
no one here knows anyone named vivian .
don &apos;t call here again .
oh , she totally got our message .
or she &apos;s just tired of a stranger
clogging up her voice mail .
yeah . maybe it is what it is--
just a number in a pocket .
attention , please .
will emily fields please report immediately
to the vice principal &apos;s office ?
what &apos;s going on ?
long story .
catch up with you later .
montgomery .
bet your grub &apos;s better than mine .
you wanna find someplace to sit and eat ?
oh , um ... ac @-@ actually ,
i was just gonna go meet some friends .
oh . okay .
hey , are we still on for saturday ?
i was kind of counting on it .
look , holden--
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m starting to feel really weird
about covering for whatever it is that you &apos;re doing .
aria .
no , i @-@ i like your parents ...
and i like you . a lot . i do .
but ... i just don &apos;t know if i can handle it
if you &apos;re hurting yourself .
so ... what , the deal &apos;s over ?
don &apos;t you need me ? who &apos;s gonna cover for you ?
i don &apos;t know . i ... haven &apos;t figured that out yet ,
but ... i will .
i &apos;m sorry .
come on , you have to eat something .
my mom thinks i sent that picture too .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
only four people ...
in this whole town who don &apos;t think i live in the sewer .
i tried that .
believe me , the roof is much better .
maybe we should just go to california .
they have high schools there .
we &apos;re not going to california .
give me your cellphone .
i can trace an i.p. address .
what was that ?
just the plastic .
are you sure we &apos;re the only ones up here ?
i &apos;m positive . nobody comes up here .
i found it when i was squatting in the school .
this was , like , my patio .
where &apos;s your cell phone ?
just ... let me help you .
just hold me .
okay ?
that will help me .
what took you so long ?
gotta get you back in that pool , em .
you &apos;re out of shape .
mona , how did you get in here ?
and where &apos;s mr. tamborelli ?
probably on his second beer at the smokehouse .
i saw him sneak out .
shut the blinds , would you ?
was that you who called me down here ?
i didn &apos;t recognize your voice .
yes , i know . it &apos;s a gift .
what are you looking for ?
evidence . here we go .
he changed his password , but i &apos;m in .
you &apos;re really gifted at this too .
freshman year , i lived in this office .
mr. t &apos;s secretary was , like , my only friend .
look , hon , if you &apos;re too paranoid ...
what ?
if you want me to stop ...
no . type . i &apos;m just ...
locking the door .
is it empty ?
not yet .
remind me why we volunteered for this event .
well , i think the truth is overrated .
i could stand to hear some more .
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i don &apos;t think hanna did what she &apos;s accused of .
it could very well just be someone trying to make her look bad .
why ? to what end ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s just me ,
but i feel like something &apos;s happened to our girls .
i &apos;ve tried to protect hanna ,
but when she lost alison ...
that &apos;s why we went overseas .
it was just to give aria something else to think about
besides that .
i don &apos;t think the moment was when they lost alison .
i think it was when they met alison .
go back to &quot; spring training . &quot; i think i saw something .
春训
perfect .
now open up the expense reports for april .
well ! baste me in bling and call me bulgari .
mona , wh @-@ what are you seeing ?
how ryan giraldo got back on the team
( 4月17日复职 )
after he was caught tagging .
where are you seeing that ?
his father owns that danish furniture store .
the fancy chair you &apos;re sitting on retails for two thousand .
mr. t turned in a receipt for $ 29.99 .
she shoots , she scores .
okay , wait .
so tamborelli took the chair as a bribe ?
yes , ma &apos;am ,
and now we can use it to get you back in the sharks .
mona , stop .
i can &apos;t blackmail a school official .
honey , you can &apos;t be a shark if you &apos;re toothless .
same number , same house .
you know where to find me .
i just left your husband a message .
turns out he &apos;s not out of town .
you &apos;re right .
but it &apos;s really none of your business where he is .
oh , it &apos;s my business .
it &apos;s always been my business .
i just didn &apos;t know that until recently .
jason , this day is about forging new connections .
are you sure that this is the right approach ?
well , that depends on how you look at it , mrs. hastings .
it &apos;s also about coming clean
and owning up to the truth , but , hey ,
if you want to stay in denial , go for it .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
so , are you ready for this ?
some dude in germany went on a dating website
and advertised for someone he could kill and eat .
shut up .
i &apos;m serious . and got , like , 220 responses .
why does every woman think that she can change a guy ?
ali , are you even going to take this test ?
we &apos;ve been neighbors for 15 years !
what &apos;s going on with your mom and dad ?
are they splitting up ?
no .
do they do this every night ?
no , my dad &apos;s just upset .
your brother gave melissa a ride home from philly , and ...
they got caught making out in the car .
seriously ? !
open the door .
no , ali , stop . i don &apos;t want to hear this .
i do . jason and melissa ?
that &apos;s juicier than the guy that eats his dates .
my dad is freaking out over nothing .
melissa &apos;s obsessed with ian . she doesn &apos;t even like jason .
... a kiss . i think you &apos;re overreacting .
she &apos;d better not .
why not ?
let &apos;s just say it would be a match frowned upon by the gods .
hey . we tried texting you .
caleb has my phone .
are those salted ? please say yes .
come on , let &apos;s-- let &apos;s go somewhere else .
no . i &apos;m fine .
your attention , please .
after the dinner break , all students must attend
the film being screened in room 109 .
again ,
room 109 at seven p.m. thank you .
wait . why did tamborelli call you down ?
she has a birthmark !
okay .
em , do you still have it--
that photo from the locker room ?
yeah , i think so . why ?
han , what-- what &apos;s going on ?
there wasn &apos;t a birthmark in that photo ! where is it ?
what ? !
look !
look , there &apos;s no birthmark ! it was photoshopped !
y @-@ you think she stuck her head on somebody else &apos;s body ?
yes .
why would &quot; a &quot; go to all that trouble to photoshop her body ?
if-- if she was trying to embarrass her ,
why would she improve her ?
what if it wasn &apos;t &quot; a &quot; who took that photo
and sent it from my phone ?
well , who did ?
if this is about an apology , the damage is already done .
i didn &apos;t snap that picture of you , kate ...
but i think i know who did .
who ?
let &apos;s just say i &apos;m no stranger to the magic of photoshop .
i mean , i spent all of ninth grade trimming my thighs .
and i care because ... ?
because , you know , i &apos;m starting to think
that someone put your head on a much better body .
excuse me ?
well , for one , your chest was definitely enhanced .
guess again , hanna .
some of us don &apos;t have to work as hard as you do .
so , you didn &apos;t enhance . you just erased .
the birthmark above your waist .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
yes , you do .
you know , next time i &apos;d be a little bit more careful
when you &apos;re taking a sweater off in public .
why would you do that , kate ? why would you take a photo-- ?
what was i supposed to do ?
wait for your stuck @-@ up bff to download
hideous pictures of me from riding camp .
like i couldn &apos;t see that coming !
you know , maybe it &apos;s time i really took a picture of you , kate .
aria , can i borrow your phone ?
yeah , in a minute . i &apos;m using it , though .
to record this conversation .
my mom has got to hear this .
i can &apos;t believe kate would send that out herself .
i mean , that &apos;s psycho .
no , it &apos;s genius .
the first week of school , she takes down hanna ,
and makes every girl pity her ,
and makes every guy want to pounce on her .
okay , not every guy .
caleb wants to strangle her .
you need to tell him to stop .
stop him from what ?
from trying to crack my phone .
he still thinks jenna did it .
you have to tell him to quit .
but why me ?
because you &apos;re in the same group .
now , go check the music room .
what if he &apos;s not in there ?
well , then , check the rooftop .
look , i don &apos;t want jenna sniffing out what he &apos;s doing .
she &apos;s got eyes everywhere .
now , go . i have to find my mom .
looking for somebody ?
um ... yeah . i @-@ i just thought caleb was in here .
he &apos;s not .
is he missing ?
hope so .
maybe ... somebody threw him out
with the rest of the garbage .
yeah . okay . um ...
well , if-- if he comes back here--
he &apos;d better not .
were you awake for that ?
caleb ?
caleb , are you up here ?
caleb .
