I'm always gonna have feelings for you.
But I don't trust you.
Nothing's fine right now including my marriage.
I don't even know what that little kiss was about. It was nothing.
I remember a young man, African-American, got on the bus,
blood all over his shirt and face.
That's Joe Olsen...
The son of the owner of the S.U.V. that hit the kids.
But didn't you say the guy on the bus was black?
Yeah, but this Joe Olsen shows up in this pharmacy
40 minutes after the accident?
I'm sorry, but that's not coincidence.
Yeah, I got my G.E.D. and I join the army in two weeks.
Congratulation Carmen.That's been your goal for, like, so long.
Brooke and me were in a fight.
And Rita came upstairs. And then she hit me.
Brooke?
No. Rita.
I never laid a hand on her.
It's true. Rita punched her in the face.
So I just decided I'm gonna wait to join the army
after I graduate high school.
But you got your G.E.D.?
Yeah, if the army didn't work out.
she can probably get a better job with a high school diploma.
You wanna share the other reason?
I guess...
I'm also sorta shaken up about Rita hitting me.
Why are you lying?
I'm not.
Brooke hit you. Why are you covering for her?
Why is she in group?
She's not even part of the program.
Everyone who lives here participates in group.
What's she got on you, Carmen?
You know, I don't appreciate the accusation.
She wasn't talking to you.
Yeah, let her talk.
Why, Carmen? After everything that Rita's done for you.
I don't get it.
You don't have to get it, bitch.
You the bitch.
Hey, hey, hey! Kiara, Brooke,
That's a U.A. for both of you.
Like, I don't even think Carmen would even cover for Brooke.
She hates her.
And what would I have on her, okay?
She's foreman, she's got all her privileges.
She's like the G.U. poster girl.
But I gotta say, the army's gonna be your job.
Why doesn't she want to get the hell out of here?
Yeah, why don't you want to get out of here, Carmen?
Can we just be done with me?
Can't somebody else talk?
Okay.
Dee.
Going home for the weekend.
How are you feeling about that?
So the bus driver lets off a bleeding, agitated guy
in front of a pharmacy.
And a little while later...
in walks Joe Olsen.
So?
So what if this guy is a friend of Joe's?
What if Joe lends his father's car to the guy,
he runs a red light,
hits Ana and the twins in the Volvo,
and takes off?
So he goes down the alley, gets on the bus...
and gets off in front of the pharmacy, calls Joe.
Joe comes and sees that his friend is bleeding,
goes into the pharmacy to get bandages or whatever.
Yeah, but, I mean...
He could have gotten them for himself.
He's got that cut over the eye.
No, no, no. That's not a fresh cut.
That's not a fresh cut.
And what is he doing in Linda Vista 30 minutes after the accident
when he told us that he was at work?
You've got an interesting theory, Stef, but, I mean,
there's no way to I.D. the guy on the bus
or connect him to Olsen.
So...
So what you're saying...
You have an interesting theory.
Hey, you all set?
Yeah.
We're gonna miss you around here.
I'm gonna miss y'all too.
And thank you for everything y'all did for me.
We were happy to do it, A.J.
You're leaving?
Yeah, Mike finally got his foster license.
Don't be a stranger.
I won't.
You okay?
Yeah.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay. Let's go. Bye.
Bye, y'all.
This sucks.
I mean, Jesus is at boarding school,
Callie's at Girls United, Jude's at camp,
and Brandon's, like, never here.
It's like I'm an only child.
Woe is you.
Woe is me.
And no one even cares how I feel.
That was Callie's social worker.
Yeah, is she coming home?
Nope.
Apparently, after she spoke with Callie and Brandon,
she found some inconsistencies she would like to discuss with us.
You've got pretty hair.
Thanks.
You've got a pretty face, too.
Is that what you came in here to tell me?
How pretty I am?
I want you gone.
You're not on probation, you don't got to be here.
But I want to be here.
I'm getting out of here in a few weeks,
and if that doesn't happen because of you,
my boyfriend's gonna cut that pretty little face of yours.
Why are you so worried about me...
if you didn't hit Carmen?
I'm not worried about you.
I just don't like you.
That hurts my feelings.
You think this is a joke?
No.
I think you are.
As you all know,
on Saturday, you'll be performing...
I need ten hours with Jin.
Ten? And when do I get him?
Mornings and nights.
And you get days?
I have to drive back and forth.
That's not my problem.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You might want to pay attention.
Sorry.
What the judges are looking for is the "goose bump" factor.
So, composers, please work with your pianist's performance.
The passion of the play, not just the proficiency.
Okay? Let's get to work. Clock's ticking.
Six hours.
Six hours? That sucks.
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
Yeah, and you wouldn't have a prepared piano piece
if you hadn't ripped me off.
Brandon, can I get a word?
Sure.
You had a rough start here at Idyllwild.
Well, yeah, but that's because...
You have a big ego.
That's a good thing to have as an artist. Embrace it.
And know that you're exceptional.
Thank you.
Do you believe you can win this thing?
Do you?
I mean, yes. Yes, I do.
Good.
So do I.
What kind of inconsistencies?
She didn't say.
She wants to talk to some of the girls
that were here with you at the same time.
The only girls left are Daphne and Kiara.
And Carmen.
How's it going with her?
Fine.
And Brooke?
Yeah.
Hopefully, this is the last hurdle we have to jump over
and then you can come home.
Have you heard what's happening with Rita?
No.
No charges have been brought against her.
So far, as far as I know, the D.A. is still investigating, so...
Carmen's lying.
I think that you're probably right,
but it's not your job to find out why.
Okay? You have to keep your head down
until we can get you home.
You cannot get into it with these girls.
Just a few days till the court date.
This time next week, you'll be adopted.
No one can take you away from us ever again.
I love you.
I love you, too.
You hang in there.
She's been at my place almost every night.
I mean, the sex is great.
Really great.
I can hear you.
And I really don't want to picture the principal of my school
having sex with one of my mom's friends.
Please.
Sorry. Sorry!
The thing is, Monte,
she's not like your typical lesbian.
She doesn't talk about her feelings.
I think it's because she's used to dating guys.
So she's playing her cards really close to her chest.
And it's a great chest.
Let me tell you.
Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs.
Mm, it was great to see you, sweetheart.
The thing is, I am falling in love with this woman.
And I don't even know if she's in love with me.
So what do I do?
Hey, uh, can we rent me a room
up in Idyllwild for the next two days?
Uh, can you say hello to Jenna?
Oh, hi, Jenna.
Hey. Monte and I are driving up to watch you perform.
We are very excited.
Uh, yeah, I'm actually... I'm not performing,
I'm composing.
Uh, I just... I don't want to be losing all this time,
you know, driving up and back.
Let me talk to mom about it when she gets back, okay?
Okay. All right, I'll be in the garage.
Hey, don't eat all those chips before dinner.
We're about to have dinner!
You know what?
I have a friend who has a cabin in Idyllwild.
I bet you he'd let us use it.
Us?
Yeah.
Brandon could stay there tomorrow night,
and then,
the rest of us could drive up on Friday night
and we could spend the whole weekend there
like a little mini couples getaway.
Wouldn't that be fun? I'm gonna call her right now.
You still think I'm a joke?
Next time, you'll bleed.
You're lucky that crazy meth head didn't run you down, girl.
How is Brooke even talking to her boyfriend?
You found a way when you were here.
She's getting drugs from him too.
In G.U.?
I think you gotta bounce.
What about Rita?
Okay, girls. Lights out.
Look, we got your back,
but we can't watch it every minute of the day.
She's right.
Don't you think it's weird
Carmen decided to wait to join the army?
I don't know.
Maybe she realized she's not the hard-ass she thought she was.
Excuse me.
I got a call about my grandma.
Iris Hensdale?
They said she had a stroke.
A.J.
Hey, grandma.
How you doin'?
I'm just fine.
Do you see a man standing over there?
Yeah.
Okay. Good.
That's Mike.
He's my new foster father.
You take care of my grandson.
I will.
So, I, uh, I did some research.
And I found out that
when you take your physical to get into the army,
they drug test you.
That's why getting your high school diploma
was suddenly so important.
'cause you were afraid that if you didn't wait a few months,
then you would test positive for crystal meth.
That's why you and Brooke were fighting,
because you took her drugs.
Why, Carmen?
You were so close to getting what you wanted.
Why did you use?
I don't... I don't know.
I was having a bad day.
I just wanted to get high.
So you made a mistake.
Why lie about Rita?
Because if I said that Brooke hit me, then she would have told.
And if I test positive for drugs at any time
during the application process, then that's it.
You can never join the army.
So, you have other options.
No, I don't.
When you're in a gang,
they don't just let you leave.
So what about Rita?
She could lose everything.
You don't care about her at all.
I've got to care about me.
My mom's a cop. She could drug test you right now.
If you out me,
I will out you to that social worker who's coming to talk to us.
What do you think will happen
if I tell her you and Brandon snuck around,
seeing each other the whole time you were here?
What about you shoving your tongue
down his throat at the fundraiser?
You still think you'll get adopted?
I thought we were friends.
I don't have any friends.
And don't think for a second
I won't take you down with me.
Okay, stop, stop.
You're not playing with any passion.
Well, it's a very difficult piece.
Right, don't worry so much about the technique.
Just... you know what tempo rubato is, right?
Of course, but it says allegro.
Don't be so literal. Yeah, you just...
feel the music.
Maybe if you told me what the piece was about.
Um, okay. It's about...
falling in love with someone you can never be with.
Why not?
Well, because sometimes it just doesn't work out.
But why?
Uh... have you ever been in love?
Uh... no.
Have you ever had a relative die?
No.
A pet?
No.
Has anything bad ever happened to you?
Not really.
My wisdom teeth got impacted.
Okay, let's start again.
No offense, but this piece is sort of a waste of my time.
A waste of your time?
What I mean is that...
You don't think I can win this.
No. I mean yes.
Maybe. I don't know.
But I don't think I can play this piece that you want me to.
Then don't.
You are obviously loyal to Tony.
Well...
Don't say you're Switzerland again.
Okay.
So what am I doing?
You're getting the hell out of here.
So...
how's it going?
Well, someone had to stay
to drive Callie and Mariana up tomorrow.
Why did that someone get to be you?
Because I didn't make the plan.
I'm here.
Have fun.
I'll see you tomorrow. Love you.
Love you too.
Oh, it's beautiful up here.
Right?
It's nice to have friends with friends with cabins.
Where's Jenna?
She had some P.R. Crisis,
so she's gonna drive up tonight.
Well, Brandon is rehearsing, so I guess it's just us for dinner.
Well, I brought grass-fed, antibiotic-free,
practically healthy steaks.
Oh, I brought...
a six pack of wine.
It was buy five, get one free.
What am I gonna do?
I mean, this whole experience has sucked from day one.
I mean, I thought this was a camp, not a competition.
And I thought I was here to play piano.
So do it. Play piano.
I can't play my own piece. They won't let me.
Then don't ask.
Well, and also, I just technically can't play it. Okay?
I don't have the reach.
I mean, since my hand got crushed in a car door...
Oh, so what you want is to feel sorry for yourself.
Is that it?
Oh, thank you for your support.
Hey! Hey, come on, don't be...
I took a day off tour to come support you,
But if you just wanna whine, that's okay too.
Seriously, this piece I wrote is just very difficult.
Okay? I would need, like, an extra hand to do it.
That can be reached.
So if Carmen tells the social worker that I kissed Brandon
a few months ago, I'll never get adopted.
Okay, look. Rita hasn't been charged yet.
She may never be.
It's not like you have any proof.
It's still gonna be your word against Carmen's.
No, it won't.
I recorded her.
On what?
You got your phone?
Yeah.
Stef got Michelle to let me have it if I kept it a secret.
So...
I recorded her saying that Brooke hit her.
So I can't help noticing you're still here.
Callie's leaving tomorrow. You good with that?
Tomorrow works.
Oh, excuse me. I don't think you signed in.
I'm leaving now.
It's our policy, all visitors have to sign in.
I'll stick around,
till gram is out of the woods.
Then I'm gone.
Please don't go, Ty.
You can stay here,
and we can see each other anytime.
You made your choice.
Ty, hold up!
Look,
I'm not trying to get between you and your brother...
You already did.
I'm just trying to give him a home.
I'm his home!
Well, then stay. He needs you.
Take care of him.
Hey, Ty, hold up.
Good luck.
How you doin'?
Take care.
Everything all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I tried to talk to him.
Uh, listen, I left my jacket inside. I'll be right back.
Wait, what about senorita Rosarita Rochin?
What about her wig, more importantly?
It's always a little out of kilter.
But, you know, she's an excellent teacher.
Totally. She is.
Yes.
So, um, how are things going with Jenna?
Well...
I like her, a lot.
So...
I don't know, I think her feelings might be
progressing a little faster than mine.
And, um...
How are you finding dating a woman,
in general?
It's different.
Um. Yeah, it's...
I like the emotional connection, and um, I like...
I like having sex with a woman.
There's that.
There's that.
Okay, well,
maybe, you know, you just need a little more time.
Maybe. Or, you know, maybe she's just not the right woman for me.
Now, if I thought I had a chance with Senorita...
Rosarita Rochin.
I was gonna end up saying...
What's so funny?
Nothing.
How was your drive?
It was fine.
Yeah? Was there a lot of traffic?
It was long.
It was long? Yeah.
How about a glass of wine?
Yes.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you need to catch up.
Yeah, I could definitely use a... drink.
If everyone could please take their seats, we're about to begin.
How's Mike's? You miss us?
No.
Maybe a little.
Congratulations, by the way.
So when are you coming to see me?
...Composers and performers,
they've worked very hard this summer.
And not only are they playing for you,
They are competing for a chance...
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Monte?
She left.
Why?
We broke up.
Our first performer is cellist Tori Phillips.
Hey, uh, what'd you decide on Joe Olsen?
Uh, I brought him in.
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Did you get anything out of him?
Nope. No, I think you're right.
There's no way to connect him to the guy in the bus.
My theory's a little out there, you know.
What?
What's wrong?
I'm just nervous about Brandon.
Okay. Certainly not as nerve racking
as it was when he was performing though, right?
Yeah.
What?
Mat.
What's he doing here?
Our next composer is Brandon Foster,
and you may recognize his pianist, Jin Chang.
Although I'm on the composing track at Idyllwild,
I decided to play my own piece.
I realize that I might be
disqualified from the competition,
but I didn't come up here to Idyllwild to win.
I came here to learn from my teachers
and from my peers,
not to compete against them.
What's he doing?
Kicking some ass.
I had a hard time this summer
because I got all caught up
in trying to prove that I belonged here,
that I lt the joy of making music.
I'd like to reclaim that now,
and do what I love most.
Perform.
What's he doing?
Is he capable of playing his own piece?
Quite a looping pedal he has.
I'm so proud of you, my baby.
Share him with me.
Congratulations.
You were awesome.
I couldn't have done it without you, man.
You were brilliant.
Yeah.
It was really nice of you
to come out and support Brandon.
Yeah, well...
Are you...
I've gotta...
hit the road. So...
Oh, you're...
Yeah.
Well, drive safely.
I will.
See ya, Mariana.
See ya.
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, dad.
That was dope, man.
Thank you. I heard you moved in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, he's a good dad.
He'll be a good foster dad, too.
And, uh... you know,
I'll try to be a good foster brother.
I appreciate that.
Brandon, that was incredible.
I don't understand how...
Yeah, it's like a looper.
It's like a looping machine.
Essentially, you can put multiple tracks...
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
Um, I just got an email.
It looks like the D.A.
is gonna be charging Rita with assault
and abuse of a minor.
I'm sorry.
Hey. I'm taking off.
Hey.
Okay, hold on a second. I will be right back.
Okay?
Come here.
这样你就可以洗脱罪名
这样你就可以洗脱罪名了 爱你 凯丽
So what's going on?
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't want to be such a bummer.
It's okay. What happened?
I don't know if I should tell you this.
What?
Monte and I broke up because...
she has feelings for somebody else.
Oh, honey. Who?
That took a lot of balls,
and your piece is amazing.
Thank you, but you're gonna win.
Well, you won the moral victory.
If I could please have everyone's attention again.
The judges have made their final decisions.
I will start with the winning composer.
The composer and pianist
who will be performing at Disney Hall...
Is Brandon Foster.
Oh, my god! Brandon! Brandon!
Oh, my god!
Brandon!
So proud of you!
How are the designated drivers?
You're the designated driver.
Moms left us up here to keep an eye on Brandon,
Make sure he doesn't over-celebrate.
It's weird they went home.
I mean, I get it.
You know, when you're not feeling well,
you just want to be in your own bed.
I wanna be in my own bed.
I'm so bored...
Ah, Mariana.
Can I talk to you?
How bored are you now?
I thought you left.
I did, but then I turned around and came back.
For what?
I know why you broke up with me.
When I extended the tour, I made you feel like
that was more important to me than you.
But nothing's more important.
I want to spend the rest of the summer with you
if it's not... too late.
You having fun?
Yeah. I guess,
You drunk?
No, no, no. I'm just pretending.
I didn't want to ruin how good I feel.
Well, you deserve it.
You know, you worked really hard.
Your composition was beautiful.
I couldn't have written it a year ago.
So we haven't talked about A.J.
It's none of my business who you date.
I'm not dating him.
Okay, well, kiss on your birthday then.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Did you come to Girls United
the other night?
No.
Why?
I just, um... I thought I saw your car outside.
Hey, so...
I'm kind of embarrassed to tell you this.
What?
The reason why I didn't want to have sex with you
wasn't just because I was leaving.
I wanted it to be special.
I know.
You told me that.
Yeah, but I didn't tell you why.
I've... never had sex before.
I want my first time to be with the right girl.
And I wanted us to lose our virginity together.
You know?
Somewhere romantic.
Like here.
Like now.
If you want to.
What's wrong?
I'm not a virgin.
But you... you told me...
I was, but...
I had sex with someone else.
When?
When we were still together.
Thanks for doing this.
No problem. What am I looking for?
Any prints off the pen
that match the ones on a hit-and-run vehicle.
Case number's on the bag.
Okay. It might take a few days.
No problem. Appreciate it.
All right, you got it.
Honey?
In here.
What are you doing in here?
Waiting for you.
Does your head still hurt? Are you okay?
Yeah, my head is fine.
I just didn't want to ruin Brandon's day.
Why would you ruin it?
Are you having an affair with Monte?
No.
Are you in love with her?
No!
So there's nothing going on between the two of you?
Why are you askinge that?
Why don't you just answer me?
There's nothing going on.
What about when you kissed?
I did not kiss her.
She kissed me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I didn't want to upset you.
You know, I feel like an absolute idiot.
I've had that woman in our house...
Nothing is going on. Nothing has ever gone on.
How about in front of the fire, last night,
just the two of you?
No.
Well, Jenna said that she thinks Monte's in love with you,
and that's why they broke up.
Oh, god.
Jenna is being paranoid.
Monte may not be in love with her,
but it's not because she's in love with me.
You know, it's really incredible
because you've given me such a hard time
about keeping things from you.
You know, even in therapy.
And yet, here you are sitting on
the mother of all secrets.
It was a kiss.
It lasted a second.
I was surprised, I pulled away,
and I made it very clear to her
that I am in love with my wife.
I should have told you about it because it was nothing.
If it was nothing, I think you would have told me.
Mariana is in her room alseep.
Is she alone?
Yeah.
I wonder what happened to Mat.
I don't know,
but they left this nice fire.
So there's something I have to tell you
before everything hits the fan.
Okay.
You know about Carmen accusing Rita of hitting her?
Yeah.
So she didn't.
And I have a recording of Carmen admitting that she lied.
I sent it to Rita
to clear her.
Well, that's good, right?
Yeah. Yeah, it's good for Rita.
It's not so good for me
or you, sort of,
because...
Carmen knows that I kissed you
at the fundraiser...
And that we saw each other when I was at G.U.,
and she's gonna tell my social worker everything.
Can't you just deny it?
Yeah, I can.
But I didn't deny it in the recording.
So now Rita knows too.
And I'm pretty much screwed.
The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.
And they're probably gonna be a little mad at you too,
so, um...
I'm sorry about that.
I just... I couldn't let Rita go to jail
and lose everything that she's worked so hard for.
And she didn't do anything wrong,
and the truth is, we did.
I did.
I hope you understand.
I don't care about me.
What's gonna happen to you?
I can't go back to G.U.,
so...
Hopefully, I can live with my dad.
Callie, there must be...
No, it's just wasn't meant to be.
None of it,
I guess, was meant to be.
*It came like a cloud*
*Covered every doubt*
I was outside of Girls United.
The other night.
*That the sun was faded out*
*Smiling*
*Will only save us for a while*
*And wishing*
*Won't hide what we're missing*
I think we should just say good night.
*Yeah, I love you*
*But I shouldn't have said it yet*
*And I know you feel it too*
*But I was never good at playing hard to get*
*If we could find a way to start the chase again*
*Might we discover that we circled around the bend*
*Around the bend*
*Around the bend*
*Yeah, I love you*
*But I shouldn't have said it yet*
*And I know you feel it too*
*But I was never good at playing hard to get*
*Yeah, I love you*
*But I shouldn't have said it yet*
*And I know you feel it too*
*But I was never good at playing hard to get*
*If we can find a way to start the chase again*
*Might we discover that we circled around the bend*
