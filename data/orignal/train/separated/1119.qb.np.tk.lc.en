yeah . i hear he &apos;s the new field hockey coach .
does melissa know he &apos;s back ?
i don &apos;t know why she ever broke up with him .
she didn &apos;t . he broke up with her .
hey . the first one &apos;s for my bestie ,
and one for each of you ,
my bestie &apos;s other friends .
oh , uh ... what &apos;s this ?

yeah , so ? i don &apos;t see
a locator bracelet on that ankle .
look , mona , i really want to go with you--
hanna , do you want to be my friend or not ?
because lately i &apos;m feeling
like you &apos;re everybody &apos;s friend but mine .
you &apos;re either with sean or shim or the others .
this is our special day , and if you screw it up
i &apos;m not turning the other cheek .
if you disappoint me , i &apos;m going rogue .
mona , come on , you know that i &apos;m your friend
and i totally want to celebrate with you ,
it &apos;s just ... things have
just been a little tight around here .
ever since my dad left ,
it really hasn &apos;t been that easy to--
hanna .
i completely forgot .

happy birthday , mona . don &apos;t forget to lock up .
ooh , ben franklin . score .
oh , um , i was gonna do the laundry tonight .
this place is out of control .
yeah , well , i guess we &apos;re all gonna have to pitch in
a little bit more around here .
maybe we could take turns .
we each choose a night to , uh , cook
and then do the laundry and then pay the bills
and then help your brother with his homework .
and then find time to grade papers
and write lectures and go to pta meetings .
dad , how much coffee have you had ?
are you still having lunch with your mom tomorrow ?
yeah .
at the grill ?
yep .
what do you think she would do if i were to come along ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you just call her and ask ?
dad , no . that &apos;s dirty .
what &apos;s stopping you ?
she asked me for space .
she moved out .
how much more space does she need ?
good morning .
juice ?
why are you being nice to me ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me ian was back ?
because normal for us is not speaking .
he told me he saw you at alison &apos;s memorial .
well , we didn &apos;t talk .
he asked me out for coffee .
that &apos;s good , right ?
ian broke my heart , spencer ,
and i &apos;m still getting over wren ,

and he &apos;s , like , old .
well , it was nothing . just forget it , okay ?
it looked like you were into it .
well , i wasn &apos;t .

sorry to keep you waiting . i &apos;m agent cooper .
fbi ?
this is my partner , agent randall
and we &apos;re here because the bureau was asked by the local authorities
to assist in the investigation of alison dilaurentis &apos; murder .
i want to show you something that was sent
to the rosewood police department by an anonymous source .
the family &apos;s given me permission to show it to the four of you .
wanna see more ? i know you want to .
if the girls knew i was seeing you ,
oh , my god , they would not stop talking about it .
i wish they were more mature , but ...
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
i have to get back before they wake up .
i know you want to kiss me .
is there anything you can tell me about what you see ?
they &apos;re at the kissing rock .
it &apos;s in the woods behind the lake .
i @-@ i think this was taken the night alison disappeared .
she was wearing that yellow top .
wait , that &apos;s not her sweater .
are you sure ?
ask me what &apos;s in each one of our closets ,
and i &apos;ll give you an itemized list .
i know clothes .
i think she &apos;s talking to the older boy .
so @-@ called , uh , mystery boyfriend ?
alison didn &apos;t want us to know who he was .
was he an older high school boy ?
she only told me enough to make it a secret .
huh . alison liked secrets , huh ?
she thought sharing secrets kept us close .
they do , but secrets are made to be found out with time .
i know you want to kiss me .
i &apos;m trying to refinance ,
but the house isn &apos;t worth as much as it was
when i bought out my ex .
i just need another extension .

i &apos;m sorry about lunch .

i got your text , and then i got a text from &quot; a , &quot;
whoever that is , cluing me into the real reason
you got skinny last summer .
&quot; a &quot; sent you a text ?
i was eating three almonds a day ,
and you were getting liposuction ?
no , that &apos;s not true .
i bought naomi and riley
matching pajamas for my party .

but then i remembered you &apos;re not coming .
of course i &apos;m coming .
come on , you know i &apos;d never miss your birthday .
it &apos;s invite @-@ only , hanna ,
and you &apos;re uninvited .
mona , you &apos;re my best friend .
we were best friends .
now you &apos;re just somebody i used to hang out with .
it &apos;s not like i didn &apos;t give you a warning .
hanna , mona ... rip cord .
naomi , riley .
what was that about ?
um , &quot; a &quot; sent mona a text ,
and i think she just broke up with me .
&quot; a &quot; sent mona a text ?
i &apos;m so over that bitch .
i thought you guys were still close .
not mona . &quot; a. &quot;
what did it say ?
it doesn &apos;t really matter . it &apos;s all lies .
hanna , i &apos;m so sorry .
i know that mona &apos;s really important to you .
she was my friend when you guys weren &apos;t .
well , we &apos;re here now ,
so if you &apos;re not going to the party ,
then we &apos;re not going either .
no .
no ! no , you &apos;re going on that scavenger hunt ,
and i &apos;m going too .
&quot; a &quot; might be playing games , but i &apos;m not .
i read your poem .
&quot; b @-@ 26 &quot; ?
how could you ? !
how could you write these words
and feel these feelings
but give up on us so easily ?
i @-@ i never intended for you to read that .
you let me believe that you didn &apos;t love me .
i thought i was doing the right thing .
for you . not for me .
that &apos;s not true .
oh , are we gonna talk about truth now ?
what , today &apos;s truth or yesterday &apos;s
or last week &apos;s ? because , honestly ,
i don &apos;t know which of your stories to believe anymore .
the , uh , &quot; i thought about you every second i was gone &quot; story ,
or the ones that end with &quot; i &apos;m outta here &quot; ?
but it wasn &apos;t my age that ruined us , ezra .
you did .
aria , please .
no . i &apos;ve moved on .
you should , too .
what &apos;s going on here ?
nothing .
there is absolutely nothing going on here .
is there something you &apos;d like to say to me .
ian ?
am i allowed in ?
what part of me not returning your calls do you not understand ?
look , i know you don &apos;t want to see me ,
and i don &apos;t blame you .
you broke up with me , remember ?
i just wanna take you out for coffee .
you guys are going camping ? cute .
wait .
hey . hey . wait .
what ?
maybe you should give him a chance .
and you &apos;re suddenly looking out for me because ...
i don &apos;t know when this war
between us got started , melissa ,
but can &apos;t it just be over ?
i &apos;m only 16 , and i &apos;m tired .
is this you trying to fix what you broke with wren ?
no . just trying to do the right thing .
coffee . that &apos;s it .
okay .
since when are you mending melissa &apos;s relationships ?
i kind of owe it to her .
what &apos;s she ever done for you ?
it &apos;s more about what did i do to her .
i &apos;m the reason she and wren broke up .
we had a moment , and ... melissa saw us .
a moment ?
yeah , it gets worse .
yeah , melissa doesn &apos;t know this part .
i also had a moment with ian .
shut up !
it was early in the summer before alison went missing .
it was just one kiss ,
but after they broke up we started seeing each other .
i feel like the poster child for poor judgment .
you could &apos;ve told us , spencer .
really ? &apos; cause ali knew about the first kiss ,
and she thought i was awful .
well , we are not ali .
i should not tell melissa , right ?
right .
spence , turn the tv up .
authorities searched the family home earlier today ,
and initial reports have confirmed that
a bloodstain on the sweater is a match to the victim &apos;s .
if you just tuned in , police have issued a warrant
for the arrest of missing rosewood teen toby cavanaugh .
he is wanted for the murder of alison di laurentis .
that sweater is toby &apos;s !
no , alison was not dating toby .
there &apos;s no way that that &apos;s the guy she &apos;s talking to in the video .
aria , you saw the news . they have proof .
if it &apos;s toby &apos;s sweater ,
than he has to be the boy at the kissing rock .
is it finally over ?
no . toby &apos;s been missing for weeks .
it won &apos;t be over
until he &apos;s behind bars .
how could i be so wrong about someone ?
i think the toby you knew
wasn &apos;t the toby that killed alison .
we all have a dark side .
she just brought his to the surface .
alison went missing right after my dad left ,
and i always hoped that when he came back i &apos;d feel safe again .
you will .
can you get that ? i think it &apos;s my mom .
you really want her to know we &apos;re together ?
she can know we &apos;re together
without knowing we &apos;re ... together .
emily &apos;s phone .
hello ?
is somebody there ?
i can hear you breathing .
hello ?
mom ?
mom ?
hello ?
dad !
there she is !
uh , maya ?
i didn &apos;t know that she had company .
um , dad , this is my friend maya .
hi !
emily &apos;s talked so much about you .
i &apos;m really happy to meet you .
it &apos;s good to meet you too , maya .
oh , god . look at you .
i think we &apos;re ready for some family time here ,
so , uh , maya ?
oh , um . sure .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll call you later .
okay .
so , i have all the fixings for your favorite meal ,
and that &apos;s a good thing ,
because baked potatoes are making a comeback .
come here , my girls .
alison , she convinced us that she hated toby ,
and i totally believed her .
ah . guess she was just playing a game .
people aren &apos;t dolls .
you can &apos;t just play with them
and then put them back in the box .
you &apos;ve been painting .
yeah . for years , i couldn &apos;t find
the inspiration to get back to it .
little did i know that all i needed
was some lies and infidelity to light that fire .
do you blame me for keeping that secret ?
i wish you would &apos;ve told me ,
but i don &apos;t blame you .
i thought i was protecting you .
i know .
i feel that i made a really big mistake , and ...
i just want to make sure
you &apos;re hearing me when i say i &apos;m really sorry .
i hear you , baby .
but no more secrets , okay ?
no more secrets .
i &apos;ve been watching the news .
are you okay with all this stuff you &apos;re hearing ?
i know it &apos;s supposed to feel like closure ,
but i only have more questions .
your mom told me about homecoming .
toby cavanaugh ?
is he the reason you broke up with ben ?
he &apos;s just a friend . a good friend , actually .
emmy , he &apos;s dangerous .
you know that now , right ?
i guess .
i just don &apos;t understand it .
the only thing that toby can give alison &apos;s friends
and her family now is the truth .
there &apos;s an honor to being truthful .
it could set that boy free .
but what if we &apos;re not ready for the truth ?
what do you mean ?
maybe it &apos;ll be too hard to hear .
emmy ,
you know it &apos;s always better to be honest than to tell a lie .
dad ...
i missed you so much .
me too , baby . me too .
knock , knock .
i actually had a good time with ian .
wow . i will call tmz .
i was thinking about what you said earlier ,
about being tired .
you and i hating each other has become a lot of work .
i didn &apos;t know that we hated each other .
i just-- i thought we didn &apos;t like each other .
you &apos;ve seen the news , right ?
yep .
alison fooled us all , didn &apos;t she ?
i remember her constantly trashing that kid ,
and the whole time she was seeing him .
well , ali played a lot of games , melissa .
that &apos;s probably what got her killed .
i want to finish what i started to tell you at homecoming .
september 1st is the day i ended it with jenna .
i felt terrible about what we were doing ,
but i didn &apos;t know how to stop it .
stay there , okay ?
please , if you want me to listen ,
just stay there .
jenna told me she &apos;d tell people that
i forced myself on her .
she didn &apos;t want it to stop .
jenna wanted to be with you ?
jenna was in love with me .
she &apos;s still in love with me .
thank you so much ! that &apos;s so sweet .
i specifically said no gifts , but look at this .
this is amazing . i &apos;m not gonna say no .
oh , excuse me . welcome to camp mona !
happy birthday .
oh , whatever it is , i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll love it ,
and if not , i &apos;ll return it .
swag !
oh ... thanks .
oh , it &apos;s , um ... subtle .
okay , tour time .
so , over here , we have the massage tent ,
the mani @-@ pedi area , the blow me bar ,
and the mini bar .
excuse me .
um , did i just see you eat a cookie ?
i asked alison to meet me so i could tell her
that she did me a favor .
she got me away from jenna .
why was she wearing your sweater ,
and why would ali meet you at the kissing rock ?
we didn &apos;t go anywhere .
we met right outside of spencer &apos;s barn .
i gave her my sweater because it was cold .
when i left her , she was getting in the car
with some guy , still wearing my sweater .
she was very much alive .
you have to tell the police .
you see how it looks .
they &apos;ve already decided i &apos;m guilty .
if i don &apos;t go to this party ,
my friends are gonna know that something &apos;s wrong .
i only came back to say good @-@ bye .
back from where ?
i spent a year in reform school .
i &apos;ve got friends in all the wrong places ...
and misery loves company .
you can &apos;t keep running .
i need to get as far away from here as i can now .
but if you &apos;re innocent--
if ? you think i &apos;m lying ?
i need you to believe me , emily .
it &apos;s all that matters .
but i still have so many questions .
i left my stuff behind the church .
if there &apos;s any way you can come ,
my ride &apos;s not picking me up until midnight .
if you tell your friends , you know they &apos;ll call the cops .
and so i said to her , &quot; if you were invited ,
you would &apos;ve received an invitation . &quot;
can you believe that ?
he came back to tell me that he &apos;s innocent
and that he didn &apos;t hurt ali .
he &apos;s lying .
we have to tell the police .
it &apos;s hanna .
hey .
hey , how &apos;s my friend mona ?
uh ... she &apos;s mona .
well , i &apos;m leaving in ten ,
and if &quot; a &apos;s &quot; watching you , i &apos;ll be watching her .
are you sure you &apos;re gonna be okay ?
aria , i went to fat camp for five summers .
i can handle some woods .
hanna , listen .
emily saw toby .
hello ?
god , service out here sucks .
it &apos;s from &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; you found my bracelet .
now come find me . good luck , bitches . &quot;
i think we &apos;re supposed to go to where we found ali &apos;s bracelet .
that was in the middle of nowhere .
actually , it was 15 steps east of the half @-@ point tree ,
which is 136 steps from the main road .
you &apos;re a freak , and i love you .
emily , aria ! your turn to get blown .
well , it has to look like we &apos;re here for the party ,
so , go glamp , and i &apos;ll be back before it gets dark .
is it &quot; a &quot; ?
no . uh , just my mom .
shut up .
what happens if you touch it ?
did you find anything ?
come here .
guys , check it out .
is jenna telling us that she &apos;s &quot; a &quot; ?
i don &apos;t think so . there &apos;s something else .
&quot; you &apos;re as in the dark as jenna ,
looking for me in all the wrong places . &quot;
well , if this is the wrong place ,
then what &apos;s the right place ?
hey .
just walking home . maybe you could give me a lift .
i &apos;m not going home .
i @-@ i &apos;m late .
&quot; you &apos;re looking for me in all the wrong places . &quot;
&quot; looking for me in all the wrong places . &quot;
hey , where &apos;s aria ?
i don &apos;t know .
we have to go to the wright place .
w @-@ r @-@ i @-@ g @-@ h @-@ t .
wright &apos;s playground !
i think you &apos;re actually enjoying this .
thanks for meeting me .
i don &apos;t blame you for being angry .
i deserve it .
i was a coward .
i should &apos;ve fought for you .
yeah ? why didn &apos;t you ?
i was looking for another job so i could leave you , aria .
i was ... looking for you .
i thought that if i resigned
from rosewood , we &apos;d have a chance .
and then i saw you with noel ,
and ...
i decided i was being selfish ,
and if you had a chance of being happy
without all the complications ...
you really are a jerk , ezra .
you can &apos;t just go around deciding
how things are supposed to work out .
i mean , you don &apos;t get to choose how i feel .
look , whether you believe me or not ,
i have always been honest with you .
but you hiding your feelings from me
is just like lying .
i was wrong .
forgive me .
no .
forgive me .
mr. fitz and ...
oh , my god .
emily .
alison loves ian ?
