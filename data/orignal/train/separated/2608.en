You had to know we would find you.
I didn't run.
Yes.
I could have gone to the police.
And we would have gone to see your beautiful family.
Please. There must be another way.
I wasn't sent to negotiate.
Please!
Are you crazy?!
I almost killed you, man!
You've got to help me! Please!
Calm down, man. Calm down.
There's a man. He's over there.
He's out.
Pulse, blood pressure steady.
He's waking up. Let's get him into surgery.
Please.
We have a drop site at southeast.
Fielding is standing by for the corpse.
How long will you need?
Tell him no more than 40 minutes.
The doctor is scrubbing down.
I need 0.05 of lorazepam.
Let's get a 12-lead EKG,
CBC, BMP.
No! No!
Sorry, Mr. Wyatt. You are out of time.
Okay! Everybody up!
It's 5:00 a.m.
Yo, let's get up. Sir, don't forget your shoes.
Hey, you!
Let's go!
What happened to your clothes?
Yeah, let's go.
Oh, my God.
第二季第三集
第89号
Looking for this.
I'll scream.
Don't. Listen to me. Reddington knows where I am.
He found me, and he is coming here,
but you need to know that you can't trust him.
He is using you.
And when Berlin is dead, he will kill you.
If you're trying to help me, why don't you put the gun down?
Has he told you?
Has he told you anything about that night, about the fire?
You need to ask him, Liz, for the truth
about why he turned himself in to the FBI.
No.
It's not what you think.
You should have killed him when you had the chance.
Go ahead and ask him, Liz.
You should have finished it.
Make him answer. You deserve to know the truth.
Your father, Naomi Hyland --
Red doesn't want you to know that that night,
the night of the fire --
What do you want, Agent Keen?
What do you really want?
Who are you?!
I've seen you following me.
You've seen me at the Millbrook. I'm staying there, too.
I was just -- I was just going to the gym.
Open up your bag.
Open up your bag. Open it up.
What the hell are you doing?
Who are you?
I'm sorry.
The Indonesian government has finally agreed
to turn over all day-to-day operations at the port
to a private company.
I'd like that company to be operated by the syndicate.
That's unlikely.
Our logistics company in the region is too small.
I agree. So I've taken steps to change that.
I'm tripling our investment.
And what if we don't get the contract?
You're fighting a war with Berlin
that drags all of us into the trenches with you.
This is a time for caution, not risk.
The fruit is ripe.
Niko, I've made my decision.
The men behind you will take you to your car.
Where's Naomi Hyland?
You know, it's hard to say.
I've never been great at reading that woman's emotions.
I need to talk to her.
You want to talk to her --
perhaps some lingering personal questions
you think my ex-wife can answer.
You're hiding her from me.
What do you know about Paul Wyatt?
Same as everyone else, I guess.
He ran an investment firm
but was being investigated by the S.E.C. for fraud.
He was stealing life savings and pensions.
Only to turn up with his heart ripped from his chest.
Probably by one of his clients.
Police say that whoever did it was trying to make a point.
Oh, well, as much as I admire the police
for their wonderful sense of irony,
I'm afraid they've got this one wrong.
The man who killed Paul Wyatt wasn't trying to make a point.
He was trying to make a sale.
His name is Dr. James Covington.
A few years ago, he was considered
one of the top cardiothoracic surgeons in the country.
Now he runs an illegal organ-transplant ring.
His operation, if you'll indulge the term,
is one-stop shopping for anyone
who needs a life-saving organ transplant
but who can't or doesn't want
to go through conventional channels...
My name is Oliver Fleck.
I represent Dr. James Covington.
That includes criminals and wealthy clients
who don't happen to be first in line on the recipient list.
So, where do the organs come from?
Oh, that's not your concern.
What matters is that we do our very best
to ensure their quality.
If there are complications within the first 10 years,
we make every effort to rectify them.
He's harvesting organs --
killing innocent people to sell off their parts?
Lizzy, some of the worst of the worst are still alive
because Dr. Covington is saving them.
And you know how to find him?
No. Slushie?
Pass.
Oh, my Gosh. You have no idea what you're missing.
Try a grapefruit gusher.
It's just like you today -- a little sour.
Two grapefruit.
Mr. Reddington was right.
Covington was once a respected surgeon --
Got his M.D. at Yale,
fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery at Vanderbilt.
So what went wrong?
He had some kind of meltdown.
According to this, he falsified a document
and stole a set of lungs from the donor pool.
Did some kind of experimental operation on a 10-year-old child.
A few weeks later,
the guy who was supposed to receive the transplant died.
The D.A. considered charging Covington,
but he was already off the grid.
I want to introduce you to Samar Navabi.
You're tall.
Agent Ressler. Keen.
I believe you two have already met.
In Warsaw. Glad to see you made it out.
Agent Navabi is on loan to our task force indefinitely.
You're the one who found Reddington.
I'm sorry. Are those real-time NSA feeds?
I hunted the guy for five years. How long did it take you?
Well, it was... uh, 74 days.
We were lucky.
They would kill to see these in Tehran.
How does an Iranian end up working for Mossad?
How did the FBI end up working for Raymond Reddington?
How did you find us in Warsaw?
Who told you we were there?
Medical examiner just called. He needs to see you, stat.
How do we know we can trust her?
We don't. But...she did save our lives.
That buys her some good will, don't you think?
You know Reddington sent her to Warsaw.
There has to be something going on there.
Sounds like someone's a little jealous
uncle Red's got a new crush.
Dr. Ryerson, what did you find?
Well...
I, uh, just completed my autopsy on Mr. Wyatt here.
I was told that
that your theory was that the
the -- the heart was harvested.
It is.
Yeah, well, buy a hat and hang onto it,
because, um, that theory may have a little wrinkle.
The incision in his chest was made over
a prior midline incision.
Tox screen was positive for immunosuppressive drugs,
and, um, I am seeing scarring of the aorta.
All of which means what?
Well, t-there's -- there's residual foreign tissue
left behind from when the heart was removed.
This guy had a-a-a previous heart transplant.
The heart that was taken from his chest
wasn't his to begin with.
Look, I wish I could help,
but my life -- it's in disarray.
We file for bankruptcy, and now this?
Mrs. Wyatt, we really need you to look at the reports.
We've been over your husband's medical files.
There's no reference to a heart transplant.
I don't know what to say.
We checked.
There's no record of your husband
ever receiving a donor organ.
They'll kill me if I talk.
Unless you talk, there's nothing we can do to protect you.
Dr. James Covington.
Your husband was one of his clients?
Paul suffered from congestive heart failure.
He needed a transplant.
H-he could have waited, put his name on the donor list
like everyone else, but not Paul.
We had the money,
so he found a way to get the transplant immediately.
He bought a heart from Covington.
Yes and no.
The organs that Dr. Covington provides --
they're not available for purchase.
You rent them --
$500,000 for every year you use the product.
When Paul's business was thriving, that wasn't a problem.
But after the S.E.C. investigation,
we couldn't afford to pay.
And if you can't pay, you have to return the product.
Excuse me?
My husband's heart wasn't harvested.
It was repossessed.
He'll never convince them to put us in charge of the port.
I don't care what Reddington says. It's reckless.
Agreed. The Directorate General may be an ally.
But we all know who makes the decision --
Garong Sundri, the Deputy Minister of Transportation.
He's against us.
And Reddington's investing a fortune in new equipment
to change his mind.
This could bankrupt us.
It's a desperate move.
Gentlemen.
I'm afraid you've made a mistake, friend.
Do you know where you are?
Yes, Niko, I know exactly where I am.
And I know who you work with.
And unfortunately for you,
I work with the one man in the world who doesn't care.
You work for Berlin? What do you want?
Berlin sent me with an offer.
If I were you, I would think of it
as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Repossessed for nonpayment -- like a house or a car.
Exactly -- he killed Paul Wyatt because he didn't get
his 500 grand in the annual rental fee.
How does that work, anyway?
Once a heart's been transplanted, can it be reused?
Covington didn't kill him to reuse the heart.
He did it to send a message.
Where I come from, fear is the only deterrent.
I'm from Delaware.
No, I-I'm just saying -- I'm actually half-Jewish.
Well, a quarter, really.
Half-Muslim, too, so... But, um...
who's counting?
I've been tracking the info we got from Mrs. Wyatt.
According to her, they paid the annual rental fee
by making donations to a charity called the Wellbright Fund.
It's a registered 501 nonprofit.
Did you pull a tax return, get a list of company expenses?
Yeah, and get this -- the fund paid over 200 grand
to a Dr. Gordon Albee for consulting services.
Consulting on what?
Dr. Albee.
FBI.
Sorry. No crime to fight.
Poor Norman committed suicide.
You're the medical examiner?
The licensing board has you listed as a general surgeon.
Yeah, well, I wear several hats.
One of those involve consulting
for a charity called the Wellbright Fund?
What exactly do you do for the Fund?
Listen, I'd be happy to help,
but, uh, I have an autopsy waiting.
You know, um, if you'd call my office --
They paid you over $200,000 last year.
Call my office.
We've got nothing to charge him with.
And until we do,
he's never gonna tell us what we need to know.
Mr. Vargas.
Sounds like some shady character in a Humphrey Bogart film.
I like him already.
He said he worked for Berlin.
And his offer?
He said Berlin's opening up a short window.
If we break with you,
he'll let us operate under his name.
And you think some of the others were receptive.
The others are supporting you at great risk.
If the port deal goes south, it could bankrupt us.
It's a very fragile proposition.
Thank you, Niko.
I appreciate you coming to me with your opinion.
But I'm feeling... bullish.
Keep an eye on the others.
If someone intends to defect,
I want to be standing right in front of them.
Hello?
I need to talk to him.
I'd like to borrow Mr. Kaplan.
Oh, my God. He wouldn't stop talking.
But I was able to buy us another hour.
We need to wrap this up quickly, though.
He has bowling league at 6:00.
Maybe this was a mistake.
It's not.
You said yourself
it would take weeks to secure the necessary court orders,
and how many more victims will there be by then?
It's the same as the other three --
heart and lungs are missing.
This one still has a liver, but I see signs of cirrhosis --
Probably wasn't healthy enough to be sold.
Remember the time we made barley stew
with that coroner from Des Moines?
It was Reuben soup.
How can I forgot? I was sleeping with his sister.
That's right.
Your Dr. Albee's in a lot of trouble, sweetie.
This should be all you need.
Four bodies, Dr. Albee.
You performed an autopsy on all four in the last year.
None of the four were registered organ donors,
but all four were missing vital organs.
How do you explain that?
Fine. I'll answer for you.
You're a supplier for Dr. James Covington.
You provide him with vital organs for him to sell,
and he pays you through the Wellbright Fund.
I don't know Covington.
I was approached by an associate -- I don't know his name
about providing him with viable material.
You deal with bodies.
I thought donor organs had to be fresh.
They do.
It only works in very specific circumstances
once I get control of the body as M.E.
How much time do you have?
Depends on the organ I need.
Anywhere between 30 to 90 minutes.
You transport them. How?
I call a number. They send a courier to pick it up.
Look, I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you need.
But you have to protect me.
Fine.
But first, you need to make a phone call.
What are the odds that Covington's courier
will inspect the organ?
Count on it.
He's gonna have to make sure the size and weight
are a match for their patient.
You don't think that he's gonna notice
that he's staring at the heart of a 300-pound hog?
Human and porcine hearts are nearly identical.
Unless he's got some expertise,
he won't be able to tell the difference.
Aram just finished the mockup
for the medical file on our fictitious donor.
Old porko's got a name.
Gustavo Mosquera, 35,
no history of heart disease.
Killed in a hit-and-run.
Time of death -- - 30 minutes ago.
Aram even generated a social and W-2
in case they run a background check.
What's our E.T.A. for delivery?
Within the hour.
My men captured this two hours ago.
Titillating.
But what Laskin and Russo do with or to one another
in their spare time is none of my concern.
Right, except a minute later...
A threesome? Interesting.
Based on his sartorial splendor, I gather this is Mr. Vargas.
Does that even look like real hair?
We have to assume they accepted his offer
and cut the deal with Berlin.
Why assume, Niko,
when I can ask them myself?
I just sent you an image of a man
who matches our suspect's description.
Got it. I am processing him through the database now.
How much time do we have?
Two hours viability max. Here's his file.
Ronald Cassell. Check fraud, theft, battery.
But he does have some medical training --
former army combat medic out of Fort Drum.
Everything checks out here. It's a match for our client.
Excellent. I'll see you in 20 minutes.
Good news, Mr. Babbitt. We're ready to begin.
Heads up, everybody. Target's on the move.
Ressler, he's headed towards the front door.
Of course it's a motorcycle.
He made me.
I'm gonna head him off. Hang on.
Doctor, we have a problem.
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go.
Gentlemen, thank you for meeting me on such short notice.
I know you two have had a very busy day.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
I hear you boys engaged in a little tryst
downtown this morning.
We had a meeting at the Corgate.
This an interrogation?
Yes.
I understand an offer was made by Berlin's representative.
Red, look --
What I don't understand is why only one of my associates
thought to bring that to my attention.
We didn't tell because there's nothing to tell.
J.P., I'm delighted you were able to hold dear Teddy's hand
and help him overcome all his anxieties
about me bankrupting our operation.
I'd be lying if I told you
I wasn't concerned about this deal.
If I were you, Teddy, I'd be more concerned
about the plans these gentlemen have for your immediate future.
What? What? What are you doing?
Wait a minute.
Stop! Red, Red!
What's going on?
Ow! Come on!
What the hell? Don't do this. Don't --
Let me go!
We just lost our only lead to Covington.
Maybe there's another way.
I just found this on Cassell.
It's a medical file of Covington's next client.
The one who's getting the pig's heart?
Who is it?
His name is Bernard Babbitt.
Bernard Babbitt, known as "B.B.,"
runs the Desobry Syndicate out of New Orleans
moving drugs and weapons through the Fourchon.
Bureau's been trying to indict him
on racketeering and murder charges for years.
So, you know him?
Know him? Oh, my Gosh.
I once shared a ride with the man
on a twin-engine prop from Port-au-Prince to Baracoa.
We had to counterweight the plane
with three containers of Russian R.P.G.s
just to accommodate his girth.
I would have thought he'd be more cautious about where he chooses to hang out.
Well, B.B.'s an indulgent man.
He loves to be surrounded with what he loves the most.
B.B.
Just like a bear at a campsite.
You poor thing.
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.
It boggles the imagination.
Red.
I suppose it isn't any wonder you can justify cramming
all this grease-drenched gristle into your face
given that you've already paid
to replace that rotted nub you call a heart.
How's that going, by the way?
I heard you had a setback --
a problem with the donor not coming through?
Give us a moment, moucher miel.
What do you want, Reddington?
The good Dr. Covington --
he and I need to have a conversation.
And since you happen to be in touch,
I thought you could connect us.
B.B...
surely you have some way to get ahold of the man.
You're in his care.
I have a number.
But strictly for emergencies.
So I sure as hell ain't giving it to you.
Last thing I need to do is piss this guy off
before he cuts my chest open.
Talk to me after my surgery.
B.B., you don't look well. Are you all right?
Let me guess --
irregular heartbeat, shortness of breath,
perhaps a little tingling in your nether regions?
What the hell are you doing?
Those drinks you've been enjoying on the house?
They weren't from the house. They were from me.
I hope you don't mind.
I took the liberty of adding a special surprise ingredient --
something to treat any localized dysfunction you may be suffering.
Has the little man been falling down on the job?
It's a miracle drug,
Not so much for a glutton with a bum heart, however.
But look on the bright side --
you'll die with a marvelous erection.
I can't -- I can't breathe.
Well, the two gentlemen behind me happen to be paramedics.
Put me in touch with Covington,
they'll be happy to assist you.
What do you think, B.B.?
Does this feel like an emergency?
You wanted to see me?
Close the door.
I got the psych evals back from Dr. Friedman.
She has some concerns.
Ressler. Yeah.
She wanted to suspend him because he was --
She has no problem with Ressler.
It's you she's concerned about.
Well, that's ridiculous. I'm fine.
That's what she's concerned about.
And frankly, I am, too.
You're concerned that I'm fine.
That you didn't mourn
or take time off to grieve --
not for your marriage,
but for yourself, for what Keen put you through.
I will mourn when we get Berlin.
Dr. Friedman recommended a one-month paid leave.
Fine. It will give me more time to hunt Berlin.
I'm not taking the doctor's recommendation.
But I am concerned.
The investigation's ongoing,
and you and I both know
there's a good chance Tom Keen is alive.
What that's done to you, how you've coped,
the hotel rooms --
Your paranoia is understandable,
but I'm worried it could become a problem.
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but I am doing the best I can to handle this.
Elizabeth...
I'm not criticizing you.
If I were in your shoes...
I only want you to know
that if you feel like you're under water,
if you need to talk,
my door is open.
Thank you.
It's Reddington.
Hey. Did you get a lead on Covington?
What are we looking at?
We've got a number on Covington.
Aram's working a trace.
It's a digital voip line.
Uh, man, this thing is getting bounced all over the globe
to mask its origin.
The line just went active.
Covington's making a call.
What the hell happened to Cassell?
He called in, said he... - Okay, hold on.
If he stays on the line,
just a few more seconds, I'll have his address.
I need you here. We have a removal at 5:00.
All right. I'm on my way in now.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Damn it.
I was only able to narrow his location down
to this five-block area.
He said he had a removal.
He's gonna repossess another organ.
Well, we got to move.
If we don't find Covington in 43 minutes,
we're gonna find another body.
Is that the 5-7 you've been raving about?
Indeed. See for yourself.
Polymer over steel, ambidextrous controls.
Be right with you.
We've been through this -- Berlin prefers firearms
manufactured in Russia or Eastern Europe.
Just give me the same shipment as last time.
My apologies.
I expected to have that all wrapped up before you arrived.
Where are we?
It's done.
Reddington bought the photo op?
I didn't even need to present real evidence
his men had betrayed him.
He has become reckless, unstable.
It seems our arrangement is off to a promising start.
Regarding that arrangement,
I think we need to revisit the terms.
I betrayed Raymond Reddington.
He is not gonna just absorb that blow and move on.
I need him taken care of.
If Berlin wanted Reddington dead,
he would have done that already.
Yeah, well, things have changed.
You're doing business with me now.
I know everything about Reddington's operation,
and I'm willing to hand over all of that to your employer,
but I need Reddington gone.
I can't be an effective partner to Berlin
if I'm always looking over my shoulder.
Set a meeting with Reddington.
My people will take care of the rest.
Landlord's still not answering.
This has to be the place.
We've been to every retail store,
office park, and restaurant in the area.
We got 20 minutes till Covington kills his next victim.
What are you doing?
I like to keep a spare key in the trunk.
Hey. Anything?
A whole lot of nothing.
Hey, Keen. Look at this.
We got a stairway to the lower level.
Lower level?
Yeah. There's some kind of access stairway.
The building plans filed with the city
don't say anything about a lower level.
Hands. Hands. Let me see your hands.
You can't be in here.
I got this.
Wait, sir. Look, don't go in there.
Sit down.
Please. I'm begging you.
I said, "Sit."
Back away from the table.
I don't know who the hell you are --
Hands in the air! Step away from the table now!
You don't know what you're doing.
It's over, Dr. Covington.
We know about your business.
You lost your license
for performing an experimental operation on a child.
Well, not this one. Not today.
I'm not trying to hurt the boy.
I'm trying to save him.
His name is Daniel.
If he doesn't get these lungs in the next 24 hours,
he won't survive.
He needs to be in a hospital.
It's too late for that.
I'm performing this operation.
If you want to stop me, you'll have to shoot me.
Won't be a problem.
There are strict rules
controlling who gets access to donor organs and when.
In the present system,
they offer adult donor lungs to adults,
even if there are children with a more urgent need.
I'm not discussing this with you.
I took adult lungs
and transplanted them into a little girl.
That's why I lost my license -- for saving her life.
So you know better?
Okay, putting adult lungs into children is a risk.
But I believe, in many cases, we have an obligation to try.
And I'm not the only one.
Times are changing.
There's even an official appeals process for these cases now.
Then his parents can request an exception to the rule.
And risk being turned down.
At least here, I guarantee him a chance.
You killed Paul Wyatt.
You ripped the heart out of his chest.
Look, you can think whatever you want about me,
but every dime I've made on criminals like Paul Wyatt
has been spent to build and operate this place.
All that matters today
is that there will be no tomorrow
for this boy if I don't do this transplant.
The donor material is already here.
If we don't use it, it will die,
just like he will.
If we take him in now, that kid won't make it.
Can you live with that?
Covington's not just a surgeon, Keen.
He's a killer.
Yeah, and right now, he's that boy's only chance.
Look at his parents.
What if that were your kid?
And what if something goes wrong?
What if he dies on the table? How do we explain that?
Can you cover with Cooper and Aram?
Just buy us some time.
Liz, this is way over the line.
We have to let him do this.
Niko, you're all in a sweat.
What's so important that it couldn't wait?
We've been partners a long time,
and we've had more than our share of success,
so I wanted to pay you the courtesy
of looking you in the eye when I tell you you're out.
I see.
And you're speaking for...?
Everybody.
We're united.
You've become a liability.
Don't forget who you're talking to.
How could I?
Especially since it's our last conversation.
Raymond Reddington, Mr. Vargas.
I may have misled you.
Someone did take Berlin up on his offer,
but it wasn't Laskin and Russo.
It was me.
Well played, Niko.
I didn't think you had it in you.
Kill him.
I find chrome to be a bit ostentatious.
I'm sorry, Mr. Demakis.
The truth is I'm the one who misled you.
You know, when I was 15,
I had a summer job
installing carpets for Albert Kodagolian
on Lake Charlevoix.
Horrible job -- hot, indoors,
forced to listen to "The Gambler" on 8-track
while the rest of the world was at the beach.
Three days into the job, I knew I had to quit.
I asked my father for advice.
All he wanted to know was whether I'd given my word
to Mr. Kodagolian that I'd work the summer.
I told him I had.
My father suggested I stick it out.
I'd given my word.
Worst eight weeks of my life.
Until the last day.
Mr. Kodagolian shows up at the jobsite,
pulls me aside, and tells me that in 27 years,
no kid has ever made it through the summer,
gives me a bonus -- $40.
The most valuable money I've ever made.
A priceless lesson about life.
Value loyalty above all else.
Oh! I buried the lede.
Turns out the Indonesian government has chosen
to contract our company to run the port of Tankulu.
The Deputy Minister of Transportation was not a fan.
Fortunately, he was also gravely ill
and in desperate need of a heart transplant.
He died this morning.
Apparently, the arrangements he'd made
to secure a donor heart didn't pan out.
The new Deputy Minister sees things our way.
Lucky, I guess.
I don't believe luck had anything to do with it.
You're right. Luck rarely has anything to do with it.
Honestly, how many times have we
discussed this?
What?
You -- you know I don't like being around the bloody st --
I need to be allowed to leave the room before the blood.
You know I don't have a strong constitution.
Give him his seat. He's gonna faint.
Oh, my.
Thank you.
Hey, you think Reddington knew that Covington was trying to save kids?
For every child Covington saved, there were three killers
like B.B. he kept alive to victimize innocent people.
It's a trade-off I'd make.
The fact that you're even thinking about
what trade-offs you'd make, what rules you'd ignore --
The Agent Keen I met a year ago would have never done that.
You caught Covington, and the child is in recovery.
It sounds like a victory.
Yeah.
You guys don't celebrate when you close a big case?
Come on. Let me buy you a drink.
Thanks, but I think I'm just gonna head out.
♬Come a long way♬
All you know about me is that I found Reddington
and whatever you might have read in a slim dossier.
♬Come a long way♬
And now we're working together with all that that implies.
♬Come a long way♬
I'm sure you don't know what to think.
♬Not to work it out♬
You're wrong.
I'm not wrong. You're right not to trust me.
♬As cold comfort♬
Oh, you're right about that.
♬Wraps around you in the dark♬
You're wrong if you think you found Reddington.
If he was found, it's because he wanted to be
♬Come a long way♬
and he wanted you to find him.
Or maybe I'm just good at what I do.
Is that so difficult to believe?
If he wanted you here, he has a reason.
♬Come a long way♬
That's why I don't trust you --
because I don't know what the reason is
♬Come a long way♬
and I'm guessing neither do you.
♬Not to ask the question♬
♬That's been on your lips all the way♬
♬Spit it out♬
♬The words come out♬
♬Yeah♬
Hey, sir?
Look, I'm sorry about that incident with the, um, frisking.
♬From small beginnings♬
Don't worry about it.
So, is that your thing -- unprovoked frisking?
♬Come a long way♬
That's my thing.
I'm a federal agent.
Figured it would be something like that.
Better safe than sorry, right?
Have a good night.
You, too.

You look so different.
Not as different as you.
