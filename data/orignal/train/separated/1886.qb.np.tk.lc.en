dr. grey , you were on a plane . you were in a plane crash .
where &apos;s lexie ?
my sister is dead .
they &apos;re taking us home tomorrow on a plane .
that &apos;s why i told bailey to just sedate all of us .
cristina , please . say something , please .
i &apos;m worried that you &apos;re just running away .
oh , yeah , i am . i &apos;m fleeing .
and so should you , &apos; cause horrible things happen here .
no . something horrible happened , and we should stick together .
how is yang , by the way ?
does she like minnesota ?
who says i have to like him ?
he &apos;s my sex friend .
how &apos;d it go with dr. thomas ?
i respect you . you &apos;re a historical landmark .
it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve had anyone who cared enough
to give me grief .
he is my bestie . he &apos;s my you here in minnesota .
they call you medusa--
the serpent @-@ haired monster who turns folks to stone .
i don &apos;t think that you &apos;re a demon .
focus on what you &apos;re doing .
are you firing him ?
we can &apos;t fire him .
we can force him to retire , though .
it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re not ready to fly .
i said i &apos;d come . i &apos;ll be there .
she &apos;s not gonna get on that plane , is she ?
probably not .
you are my person . you will always be my person .
sometimes things are simply out of your control .
you can &apos;t change them .
you can &apos;t bend them to your will .
it doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re already 45 minutes late ,
if your hair isn &apos;t brushed ,
and you haven &apos;t fixed breakfast ,
and you &apos;re hemorrhaging brain cells by the second
while you sit here ...
dying ...
dying inside .
pee .
pee . just relax and pee .
did you do it ?
did you do a pee @-@ pee in the big @-@ girl potty ?
potty .
pee @-@ pee in the potty , pee @-@ pee in the potty .
please don &apos;t make me strangle you .
i can &apos;t move .
i need to move ,
but i can &apos;t .
i think i may be frozen to this spot .
literally frozen .
i could stay .
keep you warm .
do you like being the big spoon or the little spoon ?
i am not a spoon .
i &apos;m a knife , and i &apos;m gonna stab you in the eyeball .
you know , i think i &apos;m gonna try and get some sleep .
oh ? you sure ?
i can &apos;t look at you .
i &apos;m sure .
i can &apos;t look at you either .
okay , please tell me you &apos;re as miserable as i am .
we are potty training , and i am wearing an apron .
no , i &apos;m happy as can be .
my coat doubles as a sleeping bag .
here you go , zo .
hi , zozo .
now don &apos;t forget to tell mommy if you have to go pee .
okay ?
it &apos;s all about the layers , mer .
good morning . how are you ?
morning !
we sure got a nice fresh snowfall last night .
sure did !
have a good one .
you too !
who is that ?
just me being neighborly . i &apos;m neighborly now .
oh , no . i think she just ...
did you just pee on me ?
i think she just peed on me .
see , you have a fake voice , too .
well , i &apos;m using it on a child . you &apos;re supposed to .
you know what ? tell her she &apos;s got to get her act together
or she &apos;ll never be on the supreme court .
she &apos;s gotta buck up .
excuse me ?
buck up . all right . it &apos;s a minnesota thing .
we don &apos;t wallow in our self @-@ pity .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re tough .
we &apos;re friendly .
we &apos;re ...
my car is buried under a mountain of snow .
buck up .
i hate you .
okay , i &apos;m almost ready .
so she needs a change ...
uh @-@ huh .
and i am late .
okay . well , daddy &apos;s gonna take a train today
to give a boring paper to a bunch of boring people .
zola , your daddy &apos;s my hero .
mm . i love you .
bye .
i &apos;ll see you in a couple days .
i forgot the fish sticks .
what for ?
oh , it &apos;s , uh , multicultural day at preschool .
we &apos;re brazil . i burned the first batch .
all right . i &apos;ll see you later .
okay , bye . mwah .
say good @-@ bye , mama . say good @-@ bye , mama .
bye @-@ bye , mama . i know . i know .
well , you &apos;re in a mood .
my car is buried under a mountain of snow .
don &apos;t get crumbs on the upholstery .
you brought me a danish .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t get emotional . just eat it .
you &apos;re going to need your strength . here .
oh ! a complete vascular ring ,
and a huge aneurysm .
biggest aneurysm i have ever seen .
considering how old you are , that is saying something .
now if you &apos;re gonna start talking like that ,
i &apos;m going to get someone else to scrub in with me .
this is ours ?
still in a mood ?
oh , thank you , god . thank you . thank you . thank you .
hey , hey , hey , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m trying to drive here .
sorry . sorry , drive .
that ginormous thing is in my body ?
yes .
it formed because of a congenital heart defect ,
so it &apos;s been there a long time .
we &apos;ll need to perform two surgeries .
the first one will repair the aneurysm .
in the second , we &apos;ll deal with the defect
to prevent another aneurysm from forming .
and we thought we were ready for everything .
all right , this is nothing .
we &apos;re prepared for a nuclear holocaust .
this is just a few days in the hospital .
are we expecting a nuclear holocaust ?
no , we &apos;re trained for disasters .
are you e.m.t.s ?
no , we &apos;re-- will .
what ?
these are my doctors ,
and i don &apos;t want them to think we &apos;re crazy .
hey , we &apos;re not crazy .
we &apos;re doomsday preppers , ready for the apocalypse .
you think we &apos;re crazy .
no . no , no .
look , we &apos;re not , like , mayan calendar nut jobs .
we &apos;re preparing for the real stuff--
ozone depletion , global warming ,
melting ice caps .
we met at a workshop on making bug @-@ out bags .
dare i ask ?
they &apos;re survival backpacks .
you should really have one or several , actually .
uh , one in the home and one in the car .
so your surgery will be this afternoon .
we just need to run some scans , and then we &apos;ll be all set .
okay . that &apos;s okay , babe .
small doses of radiation prepare your body for ozone depletion .
i guess it &apos;s my lucky day .
it &apos;s huge . i e @-@ mailed it to you .
look at my giant aneurysm
and marvel at the gift thomas gave me .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m driving .
besides , i &apos;m jealous . you have a new best friend .
i really do .
i might love him more than you .
i &apos;m happy for the both of you .
and i get two surgeries out of it ,
&apos;cause she has a complete vascular ring .
imagine your good luck .
oh , are you still being a bitter working mother ?
i am . i have pee on my shoe .
you &apos;re a doctor . can &apos;t you call it urine ?
because &quot; urine on my shoe &quot; is more appealing ?
i need help !
oh , there &apos;s an accident .
is it bad ?
it doesn &apos;t look like it .
i gotta go .
i &apos;m fine . there was a woman on a bicycle .
i think i hit her . i heard my tire blow .
hurry ! someone call 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 . i &apos;ll do it . i &apos;ll call .
she &apos;s being crushed under there .
does anybody know c.p.r. ?
can you hear me ?
i &apos;m a doctor .
what &apos;s your name ?
is she breathing ?
melissa .
i @-@ i can &apos;t br @-@ breathe .
okay , melissa , we &apos;re gonna get you outta here . okay ?
i &apos;m a doctor . she can &apos;t breathe .
we gotta get this car off of her .
i &apos;m on with 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 and they say don &apos;t move her .
the paramedics are on the way .
she can &apos;t breathe ! she will die before they get here .
look , i don &apos;t wanna be responsible if she &apos;s paralyzed .
don &apos;t you see she &apos;s dying under there ?
do you wanna be responsible for that ? !
i need someone to help me move this car .
is anybody gonna help me ? !
is anybody gonna help me ? !
come on , guys . we got this .
all right .
ready , guys . okay , everyone on three .
we got this , okay ? here we go .

just about . just a little higher .
okay , let me help you .
okay , easy , easy . she &apos;s almost there !
okay ! she &apos;s out !
oh , she &apos;s--she &apos;s blue .
come on , damn it . breathe .
come on . breathe .
breathe .
breathe , damn it .
oh , she &apos;s alive .
she &apos;s alive .
she &apos;s alive .
oh , dr. yang .
i hope you got some shut @-@ eye .
a gastropericardial fistula came into the e.r. ,
and i &apos;d like you to join me .
uh , with a pneumopericardium ?
a huge one .
did you do a pericardial decompression ?
just about to .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m scrubbing in with thomas .
cristina ...
i &apos;m offering you a gastropericardial fistula .
chocolate ? pretzels ? no . chocolate .
dr. yang .
sorry . not available .
wilson , i &apos;ve got cyclist versus auto .
multiple crush injuries .
i need you to call upstairs .
tell them we need a trauma o.r. open , and get ross .
he &apos;s on my service .
you , i need you to go get my car .
it &apos;s at the intersection of 4th and pike .
in the backseat , there &apos;s a box of frozen fish sticks .
grab &apos; em , nuke &apos; em , bring &apos; em up to
day care for brazil day .
grey , you know you just stole my intern ?
sorry .
it &apos;s interesting how crazy you can be
and still comb your hair .
i find her delightful .
yeah ?
you got a bug @-@ out bag in that big ol &apos; car of yours ?
i have no desire to survive armageddon .
when the big one hits , i want to go quickly .
you didn &apos;t mention your surgery
was an aneurysm the size of a honeycrisp .
it &apos;s an apple , the state fruit .
i don &apos;t recall mentioning this surgery to you at all .
dr. yang , could i talk to you ?
that aneurysm is a disaster area .
we have a solid surgical plan .
let me assign the surgery to somebody else .
no .
look , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
maybe you pity thomas .
maybe you actually like him . hell , i like him .
he &apos;s a great old guy .
but there &apos;s nothing to gain by working with him .
nothing .
there is , actually .
suction .
there &apos;s a lot of blood . suction keeps clogging up .
adjust the angle . lower your hand .
ross , let &apos;s run the small bowel .
how do i do that again ?
just take them in your hands , look for injuries ,
nice and slow .
hey , i just dropped sofia off at day care .
did you remember it was multicultural day ?
uh , yeah . i made fish sticks .
ugh . i signed up for plantains and i totally forgot .
i &apos;m sure no one will notice .
yeah , well , mark always kept track of that stuff .
okay , the break is near the femoral artery .
ooh . she &apos;s losing a lot of blood ?
um , yeah .
suction .
i &apos;m trying .
okay , wilson , just get in there
and just scoop it out with your hands .
just scoop it out .
just get right in there .
this would go faster if i used scissors .
well , when the tissue is this thin and friable ,
i find the fingers are easier to isolate the anatomy .
oh , there you go .
okay , i &apos;ve located the insertion point in the carotid .
ah , dr. parker .
two visits in one day . what a treat .
well , it &apos;s my job to ensure my department
is working to the highest standard .
oh , nonsense .
you want a front @-@ row seat to my inevitable demise .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me if i disappoint .
dr. yang , are we ready for bypass to the subclavian ?
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no .
did the aneurysm blow ?
hold pressure .
i &apos;m trying to . i &apos;m trying to .
the hole &apos;s getting bigger .
damn it . damn it . damn it .
watch your language , dr. yang .
i run a respectable o.r. clamp .
dr. yang , i suggest you get one , too .
put her on bypass . you need time to--
listen to me . dr. yang will tell you
that i have been doing this since the jurassic period .
we &apos;ll have this done in a jiffy .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m scrubbing in .
clamp on .
let &apos;s go , dr. yang . time &apos;s a @-@ wasting .
okay . the liver &apos;s exsanguinating .
ross , suction . wilson , grab a clamp for this .
right away . which one should i ask for ?
debakey .
good news .
we tracked down the young woman &apos;s parents in toronto .
they &apos;re getting the first flight .
suction , and let &apos;s hang more blood .
that one makes 57 .
grey , we &apos;ve replaced her entire volume of blood four times .
i got this . more laps .
it might be time to pack her and let her rest .
looks like you &apos;re at a point of diminishing returns , grey .
there &apos;s a limit to how much this patient can take .
she was crushed by 2 tons of twisted metal .
that &apos;s a lot of trauma for the body .
i know .
i know exactly how much trauma that is for a body .
i &apos;m not doing damage control here .
i &apos;m not gonna pack her up and hope for the best .
i need you to stop .
she needs an intact liver .
meredith , just take a second .
i am trying to save her life .
hands off the patient . now .
grey .
let &apos;s pack her up .
that was a train wreck in there .
we saved her life .
that aneurysm could have blown
no matter what we did . you know that .
you should &apos;ve listened to me
when i suggested that you put her on--
you walk into my o.r.
in the middle of a surgery
and try to backseat drive ?
i &apos;m trying to help you , craig .
i &apos;m not craig . i &apos;m dr. thomas .
and i don &apos;t need or want your help .
dr. thomas , you &apos;re a danger to our patients .
i need to see a patient .
surrender your license .
go out gracefully . it &apos;s time .
i will not step down .
okay . you want to go that way , we can go that way .
starting today , i sign off on every patient you see ,
every scan , every band @-@ aid .
talk to him .
please .
so her liver has been packed .
the next 24 hours are crucial .
monitor her closely .
um , meredith , do you have a moment ?
do you want me to take point on this ?
on my patient ? no .
meredith , i &apos;m concerned that ...
this may be hitting a little too close to home .
i mean , after what you &apos;ve been through , what ...
what happened with your sister ...
same injuries , same age .
what &apos;s your point ?
emotions might be clouding your judgment .
they &apos;re not .
excuse me . i have to go check on my patient .
what happens now ?
the next few hours are critical .
when she wakes up ,
if she can speak and move her arms and legs ,
then we &apos;ll know she got good blood flow
and that the grafts held .
i &apos;m sorry , uh ...
flowers aren &apos;t allowed in the c.c.u.
we have a seed bank in case , you know ,
it--it all goes to hell .
we have every grain
and every fruit and vegetable you need .
katy was like , &quot; what about the flowers , will ? &quot;
&quot; if the world is ending , i &apos;m gonna want something beautiful . &quot;
you know , i &apos;ll put them just outside .
she can see them from there . okay ?
this is my fault .
the aneurysm would &apos;ve blown
no matter whose hands were on it .
her vessels are cotton candy .
i know , but parker
wouldn &apos;t have given that surgery a second thought
if i wasn &apos;t in there with you .
oh , don &apos;t flatter yourself .
that man has been after my hide for a long time .
probation is one step away from being fired .
you know , i find it a little unseemly
to worry about my employment prospects
when there &apos;s a woman &apos;s life hanging in the balance .
come on . i &apos;m gonna give you a ride home .
we have another surgery tomorrow .
you need your sleep .
it &apos;s going to be fine .
thomas made me leave my patient .
now she &apos;s gonna die , and he &apos;ll be fired .
well , i &apos;m leaving my patient , too .
i have to pick zola up from day care ,
and derek &apos;s out of town so it has to be fine .
it &apos;s not gonna be fine .
she &apos;s surrounded by interns .
that &apos;s one of the signs , meredith , like locusts
or the four horsemen of the apocalypse .
well , except there &apos;s only three of them
and it &apos;s one night .
you need a bug @-@ out bag .
what &apos;s that ?
like a diaper bag for adults .
i &apos;m making mine right now .
well , what do you have so far ?
tequila .
well , that &apos;s a good start .
what else ?
well , the sign of a well @-@ packed diaper bag
is backups in case you run out .
so more tequila ?
i am out ...
trying to have one night ,
and my intern decides to close my patient &apos;s wound--
an infected wound ,
which i left open to heal .
dumbass , over @-@ eager , barely @-@ out @-@ of @-@ med @-@ school child !
i &apos;m staying .
i &apos;m going back .
hey , cutie pie .
okay . i gotta run .
my interns are with my patient .
there &apos;s extra clothes in the bag .
okay . okay .
no , no , no . no .
no , don &apos;t do that to yourself .
it &apos;s good for her to see you work .
it is good for her to see you achieve .
yes . that &apos;s how she &apos;ll become c.e.o. one day .
yeah ? &apos; cause mommy works . that &apos;s good .
okay . i owe you one .
my first surgery &apos;s at 10 : 00 .
i &apos;ll just drop her off at day care with sofia .
okay . bye .
well , can &apos;t you just give your sex friend more sex
in exchange for not firing your old man friend ?
ew . i &apos;m not a prostitute .
besides , i thought of that . it &apos;s just way too much sex .
she is barely hanging on .
should i take her back into surgery ?
what does webber think ?
he thinks i &apos;m too emotional to handle this .
vitals check .
okay .
are you still there ?
yeah . why are you whispering ?
granola guy &apos;s asleep .
he brought his own hemp pillow .
stable over here . you ?
stable @-@ ish .
maybe we should try to get some sleep .
i &apos;m not gonna be able to sleep .
yeah . me neither .
you know what we need ?
what ?
a 30 @-@ second dance party .
okay .
i &apos;m too tired .
yeah , me , too .
dr. yang .
please be alive .
please be alive . please be alive .
good news .
ms. doomsday is doing great .
while you were getting your beauty sleep ,
a lot has happened .
katy , why don &apos;t you fill in dr. yang ?
although she hasn &apos;t had her coffee yet ,
so maybe just give her the broad strokes ?
you guys are gonna go ahead with my second surgery
this afternoon .
dr. yang will start to prep you ...
as soon as she brushes her teeth .
she needs another surgery to take out the packing
and check for more bleeding ,
but right now she would never survive it .
so what do we do ?
there &apos;s a perfect window .
we have to correct her acidosis
and her hypothermia
and make sure her coags are stable .
and until then ?
until then , we have to try and keep her alive .
i am so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i have surgery in ten minutes . i tried leaving her in day care ,
but she &apos;s running a little fever .
no big deal . i &apos;m sure she &apos;s just teething .
but they won &apos;t take her
if she hasn &apos;t been fever @-@ free for 24 hours .
did i mention i have surgery ?
in ten minutes .
i &apos;m sorry .
dr. grey , the patient &apos;s b.p. just plummeted to 70 over 50 .
crap . edwards .
no , i ... no .
i did your fish stick drop . i valeted your car .
i am here to practice medicine .
great . monitor her temp .
if it gets above 101 , give her a teaspoon of acetaminophen
and push fluids .
her sippy cup is in the bag . bye , zo .
bye @-@ bye .
this is a bad idea .
parker will never sign off on this surgery .
i can &apos;t tell you how strenuously i object
to your extracurricular gymnastics with that man .
he &apos;s making you conventional and skittish .
you know , condoms don &apos;t protect against that .
how did ...
you were the first one to point out ,
i &apos;ve been around a long time .
now katy is awake , she &apos;s speaking ,
she &apos;s moving her extremities .
yes , but ...
the repair worked , so why put her in danger
of another life @-@ threatening aneurysm ?
well , what about parker ?
i spend very little time thinking about him .
can i assume that &apos;s your child i hear
wailing outside those doors ?
well , i ... she has a fever ,
and derek is out of town , and i have this patient ...
dr. grey , you know why men think they can run the world
and women can &apos;t ?
because of crying babies .
i was hoping no one would hear it .
we can all hear it .
i can hear it .
dr. ross out there can hear it .
only difference is , the crying doesn &apos;t affect him .
but you and i are genetically predisposed
to respond to crying babies .
it &apos;s pulling your focus .
it &apos;s gonna be fine . i &apos;m almost done .
okay , this is about world domination .
if we &apos;re going to take over , we need to have our babies
crying somewhere other than the i.c.u.
dr. yang , could you go over the risks of the surgery
one last time ?
will , dr. thomas went over all of it already .
i could die or turn into a potato
or start leaking unicorn poop out of my ears .
i signed the scary paper already . i &apos;m doing it .
he also said that you could live with this condition
for years without another aneurysm .
right ?
yes .
last night , i didn &apos;t know if you &apos;d even wake up .
and now i know what the end of the world feels like ,
and i don &apos;t want to feel that again .
you want me to live
with a sword hanging over my head every day ,
afraid to hiccup because i might blow an aneurysm ?
that &apos;s not living , and you know it .
we take action , will .
we look disaster in the eye
and we do not shrink with fear .
tell him , dr. yang .
tell him it &apos;s gonna be all right .
scissors . get the tube ready .
got it .
hey . i &apos;m here .
lung collapsed . i have to do this chest tube .
i can keep her till 3 : 00 , but then i ...
i &apos;ve got a hernia repair .
hey , brooks , see if zola &apos;s temp is down
and if you can sweet talk day care into taking her back .
okay .
tube is in . zero silk .
i &apos;ll just go get her .
okay , don &apos;t forget her diaper bag .
she &apos;s got extra clothes in there , diapers .
the sippy cup is in the side pocket ,
and if she goes pee @-@ pee in the potty ...
meredith , i &apos;m not gonna potty train your kid .
right . okay . sorry . forget it .
already did .
he &apos;s doing it , mer .
he &apos;s doing the surgery .
and if he does it , he &apos;ll get fired .
yeah .
i need to figure out
the exact right time to reopen my patient .
a month ago , this would &apos;ve been someone else &apos;s decision .
i was just a resident along for the ride .
now if i misjudge ...
yeah .
doomsday .
yeah .
you know what we need ?
dance party ?
nope .
we need to buck up .
yep .
dr. parker .
ah , dr. yang .
you &apos;re a day late and a dollar short .
i just had to reopen my gastropericardial fistula ...
you need to take dr. thomas off probation .
i take it you weren &apos;t able to convince him to go gracefully ?
why would i ?
he &apos;s a liability .
oh , because he &apos;s old ?
no , because habitually undermines my authority .
look , you were in that o.r. yesterday .
yeah , he saved our patient &apos;s life .
he was insubordinate and reckless .
he cut out her aneurysm
and interposed a graft in under 30 minutes .
now i can &apos;t do that . can you ?
there &apos;s no good reason ...
cristina , there is no point in belaboring this .
it &apos;s done .
then undo it
let him ride out his tenure .
firing him would be bad for the hospital ,
and bad for you .
please , just--just-- just let this slide .
look , i know you &apos;re in an awkward position ,
and it &apos;s partly my fault for sticking you with him .
you came in a little strong ,
and i felt like i needed to temper your overconfidence .
but he &apos;s holding you back .
and once he &apos;s gone , you &apos;ll see that .
okay , her temp is 96 .
what were her last coags ?
her i.n.r. was 1.3,
and i tested her ph levels 2 hours ago , and it was 7.29 .
okay , let &apos;s run &apos; em again .
why the hell are you sitting out in the cold ?
sun &apos;s out . gotta take advantage .
let me do the surgery with someone else .
dr. yang .
or go kiss his ass . play politics .
i don &apos;t think you understand how serious he is .
there is a path that a doctor walks in this hospital .
they begin by thinking that i &apos;m some sort of god .
then they start to worry that i &apos;m insane .
and then they take some comfort in the notion ,
that it &apos;s just senility .
i mean , we &apos;ve gone from &quot; a &quot; to &quot; z &quot; in no time at all .
yeah , well , if this goes south ,
it could be the end for you .
so be it .
maybe i &apos;m ready .
well , i &apos;m not . you can &apos;t leave me alone here .
oh , we &apos;re talking about you now , hmm ?
you should &apos;ve raised the flag .
i couldn &apos;t work here without you .
you &apos;re afraid to fly . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
hey , it &apos;s not funny .
no , it isn &apos;t .
you love me more than anybody has in a very long time .
look , if i &apos;m going ,
i want to go down fighting for something that i believe in ,
for this young woman &apos;s future ,
and--and these women who have so much to live for .
oh , come on .
you know i &apos;m right .
you know that she deserves this surgery ,
and we &apos;re the best team to do it .
so ...
you decided to go back in .
this is my window . her ph and coags are good .
she &apos;ll never make it through another day
if i don &apos;t stop this bleeding .
what ?
oh , nothing . i just , um ...
don &apos;t . don &apos;t say it .
say what ?
this is nothing like what happened in the woods .
we are in a hospital with medical resources
that we could only dream of having out there .
and i &apos;m gonna use them ,
and try like hell to save this girl &apos;s life ,
so when her family comes i can tell them she &apos;s alive .
so don &apos;t say this is lexie . it &apos;s not lexie .
good luck .
that &apos;s all i was gonna say . good luck .
oh . thank you .
and it &apos;s the right call , bringing her back in .
i was gonna say that , too .
so we &apos;ll take the packs out slowly
so that we can look for the bleed .
wait . it &apos;s 4 : 30 .
i thought you were with zola .
uh , no , yeah , 4 : 00 to 5 : 00 , that &apos;s dr. kepner &apos;s shift .
yeah , that was before my surgery went long .
23 year @-@ old with more gallstones than i &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s weird , right , 23 year old with gallstones ?
april , who has my daughter ?
um , ri--ri--4 : 30 . uh , jackson , i think .
april .
when i realized my surgery was going long ,
i sent my intern to make sure
that alex could take her for longer ,
but he couldn &apos;t push his surgery again ,
so he left her with ted ,
so i was just about to go relieve him right now .
unless jackson go there first . his shift was after mine so ...
who &apos;s ted ?
um , nurse ted from the e.r.
and i can tell by the look on your face
that you don &apos;t know who ted is .
um , don &apos;t worry about it . i @-@ i &apos;m going there right now .
zola will be fine . okay ?
ross follow her .
do not leave her side until my daughter is physically in her arms .
on it .
ready , dr. yang ?
ready , sir .
scissors .
here you go .
wire cutters .
wire cutters .
balfour retractor .
here you go , doctor .
sternal retractor .
retractor .
here you go .
these vessels are so fragile .
let &apos;s go gently .
you &apos;re gonna have to suction like your life depends on it .
if your hands move even a centimeter without my say ,
she &apos;s gonna bleed out . where &apos;s my suction ?
i &apos;m trying , but there &apos;s a lot of bleeding over here .
okay , keep trying , wilson . wilson , hold still .
i thought i was .
ross , are you sure my kid &apos;s okay ?
it &apos;s like camp zola in the attendings lounge .
she was smashing gummy worms into her face when i left .
who &apos;s letting her have gummy worms ?
you &apos;re right . it doesn &apos;t matter .
get in here and help retract . i need more visibility .
if this continues to go this well ,
i &apos;m prepared to put your name first .
when we publish ? that &apos;s big of you .
it is .
you know what ? you need it more than i do .
this could be your last journal article .
is that your version of &quot; thank you &quot; ?
no , it &apos;s my version of &quot; this is the end .
get while the getting &apos;s good . &quot;
thank god i never had children . they &apos;d be just like you .
i &apos;d have drowned them like puppies in the river .
oh , come on . i &apos;m your dream come true .
that ... is the truth .
you &apos;re gonna make me gag .
b.p. &apos; s dropping .
this is really a lot of blood .
who moved ?
somebody moved . say it now .
i did .
just a little . i &apos;m sorry .
it--it &apos;s okay . it actually helps .
it--it means the bleeder &apos;s in the retroperitoneum .
okay , now literally this time ,
nobody move .
don &apos;t be crass .
women of your generation think they have to be crass
or no one will believe their strength .
you &apos;re fighting a battle that women of my generation
have already fought for you
so you could have the grace to appreciate their work
and move on to something else .
yeah , i &apos;m still gagging .
you know what ? these sutures aren &apos;t holding .
can i have another 4 @-@ 0 prolene , please ? mm @-@ hmm .
b.p. is really down .
i &apos;m well aware of that .
stop looking at the monitors
and just help me find this bleed .
watch your dissection
and don &apos;t hold your breath .
now you &apos;re gonna tell me when to breathe ?
renal vessels are clear .
damn it . keep retracting .
you hold your breath when you stitch .
when you stop breathing , you stop thinking .
it &apos;s a mistake .
now what ?
hang on .
i &apos;m breathing .
slowly .
not like an anxious hyena .
freeze . keep your hands where they are .
we have to find the source or she &apos;s dead .
okay , do not panic . don &apos;t panic .
my name will be first .
pfft . saw that coming a mile away .
you will be the surgeon of your generation .
i knew it as soon as i met you .
people will try to diminish you as they did me ,
and they will fail .
i would like it to be known in the medical community
that i helped train you .
hmm ?
okay . your name first .
found it . clamp .
tiny tear in the external iliac .
okay , does anybody know what we do now ?
ligate the artery .
nope .

dr. thomas ?
dr. thomas ?
thomas ! dr. thomas . i need another clamp .

don &apos;t hold your breath .
you stop thinking when you stop breathing .
breathe . please , god .
breathe .
oh , god .
please don &apos;t tell me that she &apos;s--
she &apos;s okay .
katy has a strong heart .
she should have a long life ahead of her ,
a long , long life .
thank you .
oh , my gosh .
thank you .
she &apos;s okay .
breathe , dr. yang .
don &apos;t be crass .
you &apos;re skulking .
women of your generation are graceless .
it &apos;s an affront to nature .
mediocre surgeons will see you
and feel themselves wilting in your shadow .
do not shrink to console them .
do not look for friends here .
you won &apos;t find them .
none of these people have the capacity to understand you .
they never will .
if you &apos;re lucky ,
one day when you &apos;re old and shriveled like me ,
you will find a young doctor
with little regard for anything but their craft .
and you &apos;ll train them like i trained you .
until then , read a good book .
you have greatness in you , yang .
don &apos;t disappoint .
oh , my god . where is she ?
who has zola ?
there she is . there &apos;s your mama .
kepner had to scrub in on a colectomy
so i took her , right ?
you look like you &apos;re feeling much better .
well , we read &quot; goodnight moon ... &quot;
a couple times , didn &apos;t we ?
and then you tried to show me
how to play patty @-@ cake , right ?
and it turns out ,
uncle owen is pretty terrible at that .
oh , and her fever broke a couple hours ago ,
uh , 99.2 last time i checked . yeah .
dr. grey . dr. grey .

melissa &apos;s asking for you .
go , go . i don &apos;t need to be anywhere .
okay . bye , zozo .
say bye . say bye .
hey , you , what we gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna do high fives . patty @-@ cake .

thank you , doctor .
what &apos;s this ?
my list of tucker @-@ tested babysitters .
you need a deeper bench , dr. grey .

you never know when a crisis is gonna happen ,
and this is gold .
i don &apos;t give it out to just anyone .
thank you .
don &apos;t wake up . please don &apos;t wake up .
good girl .
oh , god . no !

not one more thing .
