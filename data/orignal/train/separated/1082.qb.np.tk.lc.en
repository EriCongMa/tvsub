pink panthers ,
most dangerous gang of thieves in the world .
this is alan woodford ,
long suspected to be the leader of the group .
no law enforcement agency has ever come close to catching them .
neal plans to infiltrate the gang .
we have a problem : matthew keller .
he &apos;s running with the panthers .
that &apos;s impossible .
keller &apos;s locked away in a russian prison .
el &apos;s pregnant .
to the future .
how long you been working for interpol ?
see , i got the same deal that you do .
you know what they call this ?
mutually assured destruction .
you got something on me . i got something on you .
interpol is not to be trusted , neal .
you say that about every institution--
nasa , peta , even npr .
they &apos;re all totalitarian cults .
lest we forget the nazis ran interpol during world war ii .
okay , the s.s. is not behind keller &apos;s release .
okay , so interpol isn &apos;t evil . they &apos;re simply stupid .
you don &apos;t make a deal with someone like keller .
but the good news is that now we know what keller &apos;s up to .
we have leverage .
as does he .
you do realize that mutually assured destruction
still contains the word &quot; destruction , &quot; right ?
please tell me there isn &apos;t a cat in there .
may i ?
if i poke its leg with a pin ,
does peter feel it ?
it &apos;s a sarubobo ,
japanese good luck amulet for expecting mothers .
it &apos;s for a friend .
i know that elizabeth &apos;s pregnant , moz .
oh , you should also know
that i &apos;m gonna be elizabeth &apos;s doula .
peter left that part out .
he doesn &apos;t know .
i haven &apos;t offered my services yet .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be thrilled .
it &apos;s the pink panthers .
i have a meeting in a couple hours .
oh , i suppose my gift @-@ giving can wait .
it &apos;s members only .
look , i &apos;ll bring you in when the timing &apos;s right .
i got to get to the f.b.i.
i &apos;ll call you after the meeting &apos;s over .
matthew keller is working as a criminal informant for interpol .
i &apos;ve reached out to them ,
but they &apos;ve denied any knowledge of the operation .
well , we did some digging .
chances are interpol are using an r.f.i.d tracking chip .
if we get close to keller , we can pinpoint his signal
and track him too .
all the members of the panthers are scanned on arrival .
he &apos;s never set it off .
no , they must be switching the chip on and off .
which means there &apos;s someone at the switch .
keller has a handler .
and if keller is off leash ,
it means he must be close by .
we &apos;ll set up surveillance within a few blocks of the meet location ,
see who else is watching .
excellent . while you &apos;re meeting the panthers ,
we &apos;ll say hi to whoever was dumb enough
to let keller out of prison .
don &apos;t bother .
we &apos;re already set up .
it &apos;s gonna take a while to run facial recognition on everyone
and crosscheck interpol &apos;s database .
if keller &apos;s handler is undercover ,
he won &apos;t be in it .
we &apos;ll do it the old @-@ fashioned way .
shoot pictures now , match them up later .
exactly .
if we see any of these people next time we track keller ,
we &apos;ll have his handler .
not a very discrete location for a gathering .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s just you and me .
what are you talking about ? where &apos;s woodford ?
he &apos;s out of town on business .
with the panthers ?
what , like he told me ?
but before he left , he gave us marching orders .
us ?
we &apos;re working together , caffrey ,
just like old times .
neal and keller are leaving already .
no time to collect photographs .
we &apos;ll have to do it by memory .
so woodford wants us to break into this company called atlas tech .
now , inside the office , there &apos;s a vault .
inside that vault is a digital file named &quot; exodus . &quot;
what &apos;s in the file ?
it &apos;s not our concern ,
but we got to make a copy of that file
without anybody knowing .
i can take this .
i &apos;ll call you when i &apos;m done .
come on , huh ?
doesn &apos;t the idea of working together give you a little tingle ?
no , it doesn &apos;t .
that &apos;s too bad &apos; cause it &apos;s woodford &apos;s orders ,
so if you want this freedom thing ,
you &apos;re stuck with me .
do you have a way in ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
i figured in honor of our reunion
we &apos;d go with a classic .
lady awaits .
her name is amy harris .
she &apos;s the executive assistant to the c.e.o of atlas tech ,
a guy by the name of harold grant .
she &apos;s been working there for six years ,
so we know she &apos;s got her boss &apos;s trust .
which means she has access to the vault .
exactly .
and the big boss , he &apos;s out of town for the next 72 hours .
that &apos;s a tight window to gain her confidence .
well , that &apos;s why they chose the best .
watch and learn .
no , wait , just hold on a second , all right ?
she smiles easily , makes eye contact .
she &apos;s a good person .
that makes her an easy mark .
no , that means you don &apos;t have a shot .
well , then show me how it &apos;s done then , maestro .
okay .
we don &apos;t need to involve her in this .
let &apos;s go back to the building ,
find another way .
i already staked it out .
this is the only way .
it &apos;s your call , caffrey .
it &apos;s either you or me .
it &apos;s a kohlrabi .
i &apos;m sorry ?
what you &apos;re holding , it &apos;s like a sweet cabbage .
it &apos;s great in a salad
with a little sea salt and olive oil ,
or you can peel away the skin
and eat it like an apple .
that &apos;s one weird apple .
i &apos;m from the nation &apos;s breadbasket .
we grow a lot of things , but nothing like this .
how long you been in new york ?
six years .
ah , you &apos;re practically a native .
i love everything about this city ,
even its vegetables .
but my parents keep insisting that iowa &apos;s my real home .
oh , they &apos;re parents , right ?
right .
can i get this ?
a dozen chayote squash , another dozen kohlrabi ,
and , uh , three pounds of jicama .
what ? i &apos;m really hungry .
anyone look familiar ?
not yet .
i keep looking for euro @-@ peter--
slick suit , skinny tie , bono glasses .
i could pull off bono glasses .
i would love to see you try .
he &apos;s gotta be around here somewhere .
ooh , that guy over there at the cafe ,
i think i saw him before .
looks familiar .
you want backup ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
keep an eye on caffrey .
a chef ? that &apos;s amazing .
easy .
easy , it would be amazing if i were a rich chef , but--
yes , but you &apos;re doing what you love .
yeah .
i can hear it in your voice .
not many people get to do that .
what about you ?
i &apos;m an assistant .
all right .
yeah .
total passion job , right ?
well , if it leads to doing what you love ,
then yes .
yeah , i guess .
to passion .
it &apos;s for you .
thank you .
it was good talking to you .
you too .
hey , beautiful .
so i &apos;m visiting from out of town .
i could use a tour guide .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t help you .
what &apos;s the matter ? you seem like a nice girl , huh ?
don &apos;t want to help a guy out ?
honey , is he bothering you ?
no , it &apos;s okay .
all right .
i misread the situation . i apologize .
i &apos;d say so .
i just said i &apos;m sorry .
you should be .
sorry .
thank you .
no .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
sorry .
no , no , it &apos;s no problem .
i just thought that was the fastest way to get rid of that jerk .
yeah , he &apos;s--he &apos;s the kind of guy that my friends
warned me about when i first moved here .
wait until i tell them about you .
you know , just to be safe ,
why don &apos;t i walk you to where you &apos;re going ?
it &apos;s just me and some jicama .
you can trust me .
i mean , apparently you are my boyfriend .
well , that &apos;s a first
because i &apos;ve never had a girlfriend whose name i didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m amy .
neal .
nice to meet you , neal .
nice to meet you .
it &apos;s hard enough putting the bad guys in prison
without the good guys letting them out .
the same could be said for you , agent burke .
i had the feeling i &apos;d see you soon .
did you ?
i thought it would be sooner .
luc renaud .
it would have been sooner had you reached out to me .
that would not have been in my best interests .
you don &apos;t want to take down the pink panthers ?
oh , i do .
what i do not want is the f.b.i trying to steal my case .
i wouldn &apos;t do that .
that &apos;s funny to you ?
all i care about is arresting them .
well , here i am .
how about lunch tomorrow ?
my job doesn &apos;t allow me to leave the desk
for pesky things like eating .
what are you talking about ?
i barely get five minutes for the farmer &apos;s market .
dinner ?
i &apos;ll cook .
so here &apos;s my number .
oh , a card , very official .
thank you again .
you &apos;re welcome .
don &apos;t work too hard .
see you soon .
yes , i &apos;ll see you soon .
bye .
you &apos;re welcome .
i had it under control .
yeah , whatever .
i handed her to you on a platter .
i mean , now you &apos;re her hero .
you know , in all that time working together ,
i can &apos;t believe we never pulled that con .
i can .
just watching your side of it is physically painful .
but effective .
we have somewhere to be .
aw , look at this ,
one big happy family .
keller , the four of us need to talk .
it &apos;s good to see you again , burkie .
how &apos;s the wife ?
shut your mouth , matthew .
why don &apos;t we all sit down ?
the four of us have the same goal ,
so we need to be working together .
we can &apos;t be tripping over each other .
i agree .
give me neal and step aside .
oh , dream on , inspector clouseau .
neal is my c.i.
yes , one that you clearly can control .
all right , all right , politeness is over .
neal works for me .
you work with me or you &apos;re out .
this is the united states .
this is f.b.i turf ,
and you know that you can &apos;t take these guys down by yourself .
you underestimate me .
no , you underestimate me .
this can either be a joint f.b.i and interpol case
or just f.b.i.
your choice .
well , i know it doesn &apos;t have eyes ,
but i swear it &apos;s staring at me .
yeah , it &apos;s definitely the most unique gift
i &apos;ve gotten so far .
well , speaking of gifts ...
&quot; we &apos;re pregnant , and now what ? &quot;
&quot; how to not screw up motherhood . &quot;
you were supposed to come over and cheer me up , right ?
i am here to cheer you up .
because as hard as having a baby was for me ,
and dear god it was hard ,
there was one big thing i wish i had--
a partner , and you have the best kind in peter .
yeah .
i do , i know .
but will he be here when i &apos;m trying to get the baby &apos;s fever down ?
am i gonna be going to all these parent / teacher conferences by myself ?
i mean , diana , don &apos;t get me wrong ,
i know peter &apos;s gonna love being a dad ,
but his job is very demanding .
sounds like you &apos;ve got hormones whispering in your ear .
trust me , i &apos;ve been there ,
but this is peter we &apos;re talking about .
he &apos;s gonna dedicate himself to fatherhood
like he did the f.b.i and to you .
i know , but--
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
having a baby changes everything .
just try not to let it change what the two of you already have .
yeah .
how were your adventures in the janitorial night shift ?
oh , a stark reminder that i shouldn &apos;t touch doorknobs
with my bare hands , or tables ,
or anything really .
you get what we wanted ?
i scrubbed toilets at atlas tech all night .
want had nothing to do with it ,
but i did get what was needed .
so amy &apos;s desk sits outside the c.e.o &apos;s office .
down the hallway away from everything else
is this steel @-@ reinforced door , which only opens
to the appropriate fingerprint and iris scan .
so we need her to open the door for us .
without knowing she did it .
once we gain access to the mainframe computer ,
we just drag and drop the exodus file onto this .
and then we are in the wind with no one the wiser .
oh , thanks .
commode cleansing always builds up my appetite .
i hate to say it , but i think we need keller for this .
great .
afterwards i have a henhouse he can guard .
no , peter was right .
if we don &apos;t work together , we &apos;ll trip over each other .
so what &apos;s your plan ?
you &apos;re eating it .
since you can &apos;t leave your desk for lunch ,
i thought i &apos;d bring lunch to you .
neal , i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
uh , say that you &apos;ll throw away
whatever that is supposed to be .
happily .
i hope i &apos;m not overstepping here .
oh , my god , are you kidding ?
this is amazing .
thank god my boss isn &apos;t here .
oh , my god .
this is delicious .
you think so ?
thank you .
what is it ?
it &apos;s--it &apos;s that guy
from yesterday from the farmer &apos;s market .
you sure ?
i think so .
i know every guard here ,
and i &apos;ve not seen that man since before yesterday .
what do you think that means ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe you should call security .
there &apos;s no dial tone . oh , my god .
what if he &apos;s trying to steal something ?
you guys are a tech firm , right ?
it &apos;s not like you keep any valuables around .
that &apos;s not necessarily true .
and he was coming from the vault room .
there &apos;s no way he could have gotten in there .
all right , do you want to check ?
i &apos;ll stay here , keep an eye out .
thank you .
i mean , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
no , go ahead , make sure .
thank you .
yeah .
amy .
the phones are working .
you want me to call security ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
everything &apos;s where it should be .
oh , hello , 1970s .
looks like i brought a light saber to a knife fight .
this is not good .
are we done ?
not yet .
mozzie &apos;s on it .
what &apos;s a mozzie ?
oh , he &apos;s caffrey &apos;s soul mate .
we needed a third man .
i wasn &apos;t gonna recruit one of the panthers .
besides , there &apos;s no one better than moz .
no secrets . that was our deal .
all right , look , you &apos;re working with the fbi ,
not the other way around .
van @-@ dwellers , there &apos;s a problem .
did you copy the file or not ?
i did not .
it wasn &apos;t there ?
well , there &apos;s a problem .
the problem is that this can &apos;t be copied onto this .
so i took the original .
the only way to access the exodus file
is to go back to the future .
that should have never left the vault .
if someone discovers this missing ,
this operation is a bust .
we got it out .
we &apos;ll get it back in
after extracting the exodus file .
good luck with that .
this is a first generation &quot; minnow &quot; disk ,
state of the art in 1971 .
yeah , the primordial ooze of magnetic storage .
holds a whopping 80 kilobytes , which in modern standards
is like using a minivan to haul a family of fleas .
now , these early disks were never marketed commercially ,
so you &apos;ll be hard pressed to find a drive
that can read it or talk to it .
mm , they &apos;re out there .
a high tech security firm uses an antique .
why ?
eh , cold war @-@ era tech .
it &apos;s the new firewall .
unlike cloud @-@ based systems and password encoded networks ,
they can &apos;t be hacked .
no internet connections , no espionage .
listen , our military trusts those antiques
to protect the launch commands at nuclear silos .
okay , we print the file .
use the girl to put it back .
no .
no , we &apos;re not using amy again .
if it is not returned , she loses as well , no ?
he has a point .
look , she doesn &apos;t deserve this .
well , do you know any other way ?
oh , not really .
i mean , that vault is too secure to break back into .
i just don &apos;t want to hurt her .
well , she could get hurt worse if you don &apos;t .
she thinks i &apos;m a chef .
i &apos;ll make her dinner tonight ,
stall her until you &apos;ve printed out a copy ,
you bring the disk over ...
you create a small diversion ,
and i &apos;ll slip it into her purse .
and when she finds it ?
she puts it back where it belongs .
right , to save herself ?
but she &apos;ll know i did it .
she &apos;ll know she was conned .
any way to soften the blow ?
make this the most uneventful dinner date ever ?
hi , hon .
hey , honey .
oh , uh , luc , this is my wife , elizabeth .
elizabeth , this is luc renaud from interpol .
oh , the man who let my kidnapper go free .
welcome .
good luck with that .
listen , mozzie &apos;s in the dining room .
i think he fell off the yard sale wagon again .
good night .
why here ? why not the f.b.i. ?
ah , the french and their inquisitions .
hello , suit .
le suit .
uh , mozzie avoids the f.b.i ..
i only make an appearance when neal needs my assistance .
le suit , in your honor , not that you deserve any ,
i brought a 2005 chateau de la vere .
you &apos;re welcome .
i do not drink .
i &apos;m sorry ?
i don &apos;t enjoy the taste .
have you been scanned for a brain tumor ?
do i want to know how you got all this stuff ?
um , let &apos;s just say i borrowed them
from someone &apos;s personal collection .
mozzie .
in exchange for something from mine .
no more questions , okay ?
so , since we don &apos;t have all the exact equipment
needed to read the disk ,
this will require a lot of trial , error , musing .
well , let &apos;s go easy on the musing .
we don &apos;t know how many courses neal
has to stall her with .
this is why neal has recruited someone
to cool down the proceedings .
amy , wow .
you look ...
you look like summer .
hot and humid ?
no , no , golden . come in .
i bought it just for tonight .
something smells delicious .
uh , yeah , it &apos;s fish .
i hope you &apos;re not allergic .
oh , no , i can eat anything .
your place ,
my god , it &apos;s beautiful .
i need to turn the fish .
ooh , sole meuniere ?
it &apos;s real sole from europe .
pacific is not true sole . it &apos;s more of a flounder .
okay , is there anything you don &apos;t know about food ?
i &apos;m always eager to learn something new .
me too .
i think this &apos;ll be the perfect pairing .
what ?
the wine .
oh , right , yes .
oh , yes , this is the , uh , sauvignon blanc ,
sancerre from the loire valley .
yeah .
yeah .
it &apos;s better to drink it than talk about it .
you &apos;re right .
oh , i have leeks to slice .
i have always wanted to learn how to do this .
will you show me ?
sure .
yeah , the secret is to hold the knife properly .
just pinch the hilt here , feel the weight of it .
okay . like this ?
yeah , like that , and take with your other hand ,
these three fingers , middle and the front ,
the other two behind ,
and let your knuckle guide the knife ,
and slice going forward .
okay , i think this looked a lot easier when you did it .
no , you just have to let the knife do the work for you .
be careful , it &apos;s sharp .
i &apos;m kind of a klutz .
no , that &apos;s okay . no , no , no , see ?
you barely have to move your arm .
just slice going forward .
there you go .
you better keep your eye on the leeks .
you &apos;re going to cut yourself .
oh , sorry .
oh , hello , hello .
june .
i hope i &apos;m not intruding .
no , not at all . come in .
amy , this is my good friend and landlady , june .
june , this is amy ... my guest .
oh , hi .
hello , amy .
nice to meet you .
nice to see you .
those smells were coming up the stairs .
i had to come up to see what is neal cooking ?
neal was just telling me the history of the sole .
yeah .
sole meuniere ?
my favorite .
i hope you &apos;ve prepared lots .
oh , yes , always .
june , have i ever told you the difference
between pacific and european sole ?
um , no .
well , it &apos;s fascinating .
you see , european sole--
another loser ?
give me some room .
and by the way , cologne is not a substitute for daily bathing .
maybe you loaded the disk incorrectly .
it &apos;s not like loading a dishwasher .
it &apos;s more like making a seating arrangement for a wedding ,
putting the right people together
so that they might actually talk to each other .
okay .
i did it ?
i did it .
dos , meet dot .
dot , dos .
and when a dot and a dos love each other very much ...
oh , i miss that sound .
that &apos;s it . it has to be .
i &apos;m gonna call neal .
hey , we opened the file .
it &apos;s printing now .
good , good .
june threw an excellent block .
terrific .
all right , remember , when i get there ,
create a diversion .
peter .
yeah .
i really like her , and i think she likes me too .
it &apos;s gonna kill her when she gets home
and discovers that disk .
well , maybe she won &apos;t connect it with you .
come on , when she left her house ,
she didn &apos;t have the disk , and after seeing me , she does ?
what else could she think ?
i &apos;m sorry .
all right .
what &apos;d i miss ?
uh , nothing we want to share .
i better be going .
whoa , so soon ?
yeah , you haven &apos;t had the fish yet .
amy and i are going to have breakfast together .
really ?
yes .
sorry , you &apos;re not invited .
ouch .
bye .
bye .
bye .
you must be starving .
i could wait .
you sure ?
june &apos;s great , isn &apos;t she ?
she &apos;s a lovely lady ,
but she &apos;s gone .
we &apos;re still here .
you know , when i got to new york ,
i didn &apos;t have anything .
no place to stay , no clothes ,
she let me stay here until i could--
that &apos;s not my phone .
sorry , that &apos;s my boss &apos;s ringtone .
that &apos;s okay .
hang on .
okay .
hold that thought .
i have to take this .
mr. grant , how &apos;s london ?
oh , you are ?
when ?
what ?
yeah .
right , no , no , no , first thing .
i &apos;ll be there .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my boss came back early .
there &apos;s something very important missing from the vault .
i &apos;m gonna be fired .
what is all this ?
could be a top secret cryptogram .
looks more like a complex algorithm to me .
that &apos;s what they want you to believe .
they ?
them .
the man .
the right hand . the eye in the sky .
the suits .
the pink panthers are thieves .
you are a most peculiar man .
until i &apos;m right .
my c.i. , my mission .
to you it &apos;s a mission .
to me it &apos;s everything .
neal has never worked with you .
it &apos;s time he started .
okay .
i &apos;m done .
two suits acting like suits is two suits too many .
oh , and again , you &apos;re welcome .
amy &apos;s boss came back early .
he knows the exodus file is missing .
has he called the police ?
a security firm admitting that their security is breached ?
i doubt it , not until they
come up with a way to cover their asses .
how much time to fix this ?
the time it takes for me to change back into my suit ,
kiss my wife good @-@ bye ,
and drive to harold grant &apos;s home .
to do what ?
tell him the truth .
we took the file as part of an f.b.i investigation .
maybe he &apos;ll cooperate .
what if he doesn &apos;t ?
we throw all of this away ?
i want this as much as you do ,
but this is our only play right now .
what about the girl ?
she &apos;s an innocent in all this .
i &apos;ll make sure nothing bad happens to her .
i &apos;ll call neal ,
have him send her home .
matthew , grab your gun .
i need you to meet me .
why would he blame you ?
it &apos;s my job to take care of things while he &apos;s away ,
and boy , i sure did a great job ,
let a top secret file get stolen from under my nose .
luc ?
let &apos;s go .
luc ?
先不要对格兰特说 -卢克
i &apos;ve had this job since i first arrived in new york ,
six years trying to move up the ladder .
guess i fell off before i climbed very far .
will you call me after you meet with him ?
i don &apos;t want you to go through this alone .
thank you .
where &apos;s amy ?
she just went into her apartment .
luc took the disk .
he could be trying to plant it on her .
oh , sweetheart ,
you should have climbed into that tub .
i &apos;m calling the police .
i can &apos;t let you do that .
hey , just relax . just relax .
just relax , okay ?
everything &apos;s gonna be--hey . everything &apos;s gonna be just fine .
let &apos;s just talk about--
wait , why are you doing this ?
neal !
she knows we stole it , caffrey .
wait .
you two know each other ?
she &apos;s smarter than i thought .
he &apos;s a conman , okay ?
you &apos;ve been conned , but don &apos;t feel special , all right ?
you &apos;re not his first victim .
he &apos;s done this to people all over the world .
right , kid ?
is that true ?
i &apos;m afraid it is .
caffrey , we &apos;re out of options , all right ?
we need to take care of this .
come on .
don &apos;t touch me !
no , get off of her .
just stay back , all right ?
she &apos;s gonna help us .
i &apos;m not helping you .
look , i never meant to get you into trouble ,
but i did ,
and i will get you out .
how ?
by confessing .
you took the disk , no one else .
i &apos;m not confessing to something i didn &apos;t do .
you have to .
look , we work for killers , men worse than him .
they know where you live , where you work .
no .
no , no , you &apos;re just still trying to con me .
no .
i confess , i go to jail .
you two get off scot @-@ free .
you &apos;re not going to jail .
you &apos;re gonna climb the ladder .
tomorrow morning , you &apos;re gonna take this disk
into your boss &apos;s office and tell him .
mr. grant ,
i stole the exodus file .
you &apos;ve given him six years of loyalty
with no recognition , no promotions .
i &apos;m the first one here in the morning ,
and the last to leave at night .
you see me as an assistant ,
and you &apos;ve never seen me as anything else .
now you will .
by stealing this disk ,
you &apos;ve exposed a major security flaw in this company .
you are in serious trouble .
and so are you .
this flaw could be troubling for our clients .
if you can &apos;t protect a little disk ...
now for the closer .
you offer your silence .
he gets the disk back ,
no one will ever know it was gone ,
but in exchange for your silence ,
you get a promotion to the level you deserve .
after all , you &apos;ve proven that he underestimated you .
well ?
well , i did exactly as you said .
and ?
and i quit .
what are you talking about ? he didn &apos;t offer you a promotion ?
he would have done anything to keep me quiet .
then why--
i didn &apos;t want it that way .
i don &apos;t use and manipulate people to get what i want .
i &apos;m not like you .
amy-- ooh !
thank you .
for making me realize i don &apos;t belong in this city .
you were right . it &apos;s an algorithm .
what does it calculate ?
it doesn &apos;t calculate anything . it chooses .
it draws lines between variables connecting them
in a seemingly arbitrary manner .
like a randomizer .
yeah .
what are the variables ?
there are three categories ,
a different amount of variables in each one .
here &apos;s category one .
letters dfw , bos , msp .
international airports .
all of them in the u.s.
these right here , airlines and corresponding plane numbers .
international airlines .
so whatever they &apos;re transporting
is going in and out of the country .
we haven &apos;t figured out what these numbers mean yet ,
but we think it has something to do
with where the shipment ends up .
if everything is chosen at random--
no one knows who &apos;s flying or where
until the algorithm chooses .
cloaked in this kind of secrecy ,
it must be a very high value target .
and without planning ,
it &apos;s almost an impossible heist .
unless you have the algorithm .
of which , thanks to neal and keller ,
the pink panthers do .
excellent work , you two .
luc .
have a seat .
you stole evidence from my house .
i called interpol hoping i could bring you in .
when i mentioned your name ,
they acted like i was reporting an elvis sighting .
you &apos;re upset . i don &apos;t understand .
thanks to my c.i. ,
woodford has a copy of the exodus file ,
and atlas tech stayed quiet .
win @-@ win .
your c.i. almost killed an innocent girl .
my c.i. &apos; s the only reason you and i
aren &apos;t both mall cops right now .
does it matter anymore ?
i will not risk an innocent life .
and i will do whatever is necessary
to bring down the panthers .
not on my watch .
then when you &apos;re not watching .
how about i arrest you right now
for interfering with an f.b.i investigation ?
interpol said you didn &apos;t exist .
we have places we can put you where you don &apos;t .
a slap , very joan crawford .
i deserved it .
i never should have put amy in harm &apos;s way .
oh , you mean keller &apos;s way ?
even worse .
there is no worse except maybe luc .
he has me seriously reconsidering my francophilia .
well , at least now we know he &apos;s not afraid
to get his hands dirty .
uh , he &apos;s a frenchman who doesn &apos;t drink wine .
he &apos;s capable of anything .
i never wanted to be this guy , moz .
someone who hurts innocent people .
the conman &apos;s quandary .
maybe that &apos;s why i like working for the f.b.i.
they only con bad people .
i still ascribe to w.c. fields &apos; mantra .
&quot; you can &apos;t cheat an honest man . &quot;
well , amy was the exception .
she &apos;s a good person ,
spent years trying to build her future ,
and i stole that from her .
or you could look at it the other way .
what other way ?
if you hadn &apos;t been there to protect her from keller ,
she wouldn &apos;t have had a future to steal .
honey .
new in town , sailor ?
you look hot .
come here .
oh , no , no , no .
that &apos;s gonna cost you a very expensive dinner downtown .
on a tuesday ?
yes .
we have six months to be spontaneous .
the baby .
yes .
it &apos;s going to set our schedule ,
so we have 8 : 00 reservations at babo .
let &apos;s be late .
hey , hon ...
i &apos;m being spontaneous .
you &apos;re gonna be here for us , right ,
me and the baby ?
yeah , why wouldn &apos;t i ?
i know you do important work ,
but being a father is important too .
i &apos;ve spent years dreaming of being a dad ,
and i don &apos;t want to miss one second of it .
i am gonna love watching you be a mom .
we &apos;re gonna be great parents .
let &apos;s just not lose this ,
us ,
what we had when i held up that sign
and we smiled at each other
across houston street .
that is impossible .
let &apos;s be really late .
oh , okay .
chess , huh ?
oh , this is like old times .
don &apos;t sit .
it &apos;s more challenging playing against myself .
is that right ?
then why the call ?
amy .
breaking into her apartment , going for your knife ,
it was a very fat line you crossed .
yeah , well , forgive me , caffrey , for i have sinned .
what is it , huh ?
what &apos;s my penance ?
you being you .
if you try anything like that again ,
i throw my grenade .
and i throw mine , and we &apos;re both dead .
so where &apos;s the sweet spot ?
i don &apos;t need one .
collateral damage is a conman &apos;s byproduct , caffrey .
see , guys like us ,
we hurt people around us .
i &apos;m not a guy like you .
you keep telling yourself that , sweetheart .
so what , you got it all figured out ?
take down the panthers , we get our freedom , and then what ?
we live happily ever after ?
yeah , something like that .
something like that .
yeah , you &apos;re living in a fairy tale , caffrey .
no matter what happens , me and you ,
we &apos;re hunted men .
we take down woodford and his crew ,
it &apos;s never over .
even in prison they &apos;ll come looking for us .
and their reach , my friend , it is far ,
and it is wide .
and the panthers , neal , they don &apos;t stop looking for rats until they &apos;re dead .
until then , guess who they go after .
people closest to you .
and they make it hurt , caffrey .
they make it hurt so bad
that you &apos;ll wish that they found you .
so you enjoy this freedom you &apos;re working so hard to get .
because when you &apos;re footloose and fancy free ,
those people that you love so much ,
they are on death roll .
