rach , there is a decent place .
and your lap does not count .
come on , help me move this .
no , no , no .

rosita does not move .
i &apos;m sorry . rosita ? as in ... ?
as in &quot; rosita does not move . &quot;
it &apos;s just a chair . what &apos;s the big deal ?
it &apos;s the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen ...
... and it &apos;s at an angle where you don &apos;t get any glare coming off stevie .
stevie the tv ?
is there a problem ?
no .
what does he know ?
come on , rosita . us chicas gotta stick together .
you bitch !
the one where rosita dies
hey , you know what &apos;s weird ?
after you guys get married , when you introduce me to people ...
... you &apos;re gonna have to say , &quot; this is my brother @-@ in @-@ law , ross . &quot;
not &quot; my friend , ross , &quot; &quot; brother @-@ in @-@ law , ross . &quot;
that &apos;s weird , isn &apos;t it ?
couldrt i just say , &quot; this is ross &quot; ?
sure , do whatever you want .
hey , ross ?
i checked the real estate section .
look at this .
looks like mom and dad &apos;s house .
even has a tree with a broken limb out front .
and the window in the attic ...
oh , my god !
what happened to the window in the attic ?
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re selling it .
and they didn &apos;t tell us .
what happened to the window in the attic ?
hello , dad ? monica and i just saw the house in the paper .
yes , we &apos;re surprised .
who did you leave a message with ?
sorry !
joey , joey , i &apos;m so sorry .
i told you not to move it ! how would you feel if , say ...
... i wanted to move your mom , okay ...
... and you said , &quot; don &apos;t , &quot; and i did it anyway ...
... and her head fell off ?
i &apos;ll buy you a new one , okay ?
we &apos;ll go to the store and get you a new chair right now .
she &apos;s not even cold yet .
wouldrt rosita have wanted you to move on ?
i mean , you know , she did always put your comfort first .
that &apos;s true .
okay , you ready ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t want stevie to see her like this .
i can &apos;t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in .
man , some stranger &apos;s gonna be in my room .
for 15 years they kept it as a shrine to you .
it &apos;s time the velvet ropes came down .
they kept your room a while .
please ! dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out .
i gotta say , a tanning bed and a stack of victoria &apos;s secret catalogs ?
not a gym .
come on . you know they love you .
as much as they love you ?
they thought she was barren until i was born . it &apos;s not my fault .
i hate this year .
what &apos;s wrong with this year ?
it &apos;s february and i &apos;ve only given two massages ...
... and they were both horrible tippers .
that was me and ross .
oh , that &apos;s right .
if you want some extra cash ...
... some college friends made good money doing telemarketing .
that &apos;s a great idea . you &apos;re really good on the phone .
it &apos;d be better than the last telephone job i had .
i probably won &apos;t have to say &quot; spank &quot; as much .
what ?
oh , yeah , like you never called .
this is very easy . you read from the script ...
... and try to sell as much toner as you can .
okay , i can do that .
by the way , i love my office .
why don &apos;t we do a trial run ?
oh , okay .
all right .
hi , this is phoebe from empire office supplies .
can i speak to your supply manager ?
i &apos;m the supply manager .
i &apos;d like to talk about your toner needs .
we don &apos;t need any .
okay , sorry to bother you . bye @-@ bye .
yeah , you &apos;re right . this is easy .
okay . what was wrong with that call ?
oh , well , all right .
no offense , but you were kind of rude .
they always say they don &apos;t need toner . that &apos;s okay .
whatever they say , you can find the answer to it , here in the script .
so i think you &apos;re ready to sell toner .
do you have any last questions ?
no .
wait , yes , i do have one question :
what is toner ?
joey ?
joe ?
full bag ?
beer &apos;s still cold .
something terrible must have happened here .
oh , no , no , no !
stevie , i was never here .
dad ?
i &apos;m here !
hey .
hi .
seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work .
we can &apos;t believe you &apos;re selling the house .
time for a new family to start here .
i hope their check clears before they find the crack ...
... in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling .
let &apos;s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here .
sorry we can &apos;t store your things .
oh , it &apos;s okay .
i can &apos;t wait to see everything again .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s down here .
but there are six or seven easy @-@ bake ovens in the attic .
i used to love to play restaurant .
not as much as you loved to play &quot; uncooked batter eater . &quot;
you can &apos;t expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies .
so i think your boxes are over here .
oh , great .
hey ...
... whose cigarettes are these ?
i don &apos;t know .
they must be your mother &apos;s .
but please , please don &apos;t ask her . i &apos;ll throw these away .
cool ! dad , my report cards !
hey , check this out .
math , &quot; a. &quot; science , &quot; a. &quot; history , &quot; a. &quot; gym ...
my rock polisher !
oh , look , there &apos;s your old makeup kit .
it &apos;s a clown kit . clown kit !
but the white seems to be untouched .
uh @-@ oh .
what ?
you know how the garage floods every spring ?
how are you ever gonna sell this place ?
i think i accidentally used monica &apos;s boxes ...
... to keep the water away from the porsche .
oh , no , dad . dad ?
what the ...
oh , god . everything &apos;s ruined !
dad , she &apos;s gonna be crushed .
you don &apos;t secretly smoke , do you ?
no .
so it &apos;s just your mother then .
hi . this is phoebe from empire office supplies .
can i speak to your supply manager , please ?
earl . thanks .
hi , earl . this is phoebe from empire office supplies .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about your toner needs .
i don &apos;t need any toner .
i hear what you &apos;re saying , but at our prices , everyone needs toner .
not me .
may i ask why ?
you want to know why ?
you want to know why ?
i surely do .
okay .
i don &apos;t need any toner ...
... because i &apos;m gonna kill myself .
is that because you &apos;re out of toner ?
okay , so no toner today . thanks anyway . bye @-@ bye .
wait , wait ! i can &apos;t let you hang up . just please talk to me .
well ...
i only had one thing to do today .
i guess i could push it back .
yeah . now , why do you want to kill yourself ?
i &apos;ve been working for 10 years now at this ...
... meaningless , dead @-@ end job ...
... and nobody here even knows that i exist .
chandler ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
look ...
... l &apos;m sure that people know you exist .
oh , yeah ? i work in a cubicle ...
... surrounded by people .
i &apos;ve been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself ...
... and no one &apos;s even looked up from their desk . hang on .
hey , everybody ...
... l &apos;m gonna kill myself .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
i got nothing .
wait .
hey , marge .
nothing . nothing .
good chair .
now , if anybody asks ...
... your name is rosita .
come on , joey . i just bought you a new chair , the most expensive one in the store .
you know what i was thinking ? we could name her francette .
francette ?
what is she , a couch ?
poor thing . cut down in her prime .
joey , the new chair will be here in an hour .
maybe we should move rosita out of here .
start the healing process .
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right .
maybe i &apos;ll take her down to the incinerator .
it &apos;s gonna be so sad .
and kind of cool .
she &apos;s healed !
that &apos;s weird .
no , it &apos;s not weird .
it &apos;s a miracle !
it &apos;s not a miracle . i &apos;m sure there &apos;s an explanation .
there is . if your heart is pure , wondrous things can happen .
i don &apos;t ...
can you tell me how this happened ?
well , no .
miracle .
no , you know what , maybe somebody came in here and fixed it . or something .
someone like an angel ?
that &apos;s right , joey . the chair angel came in and healed your chair .
get your non @-@ believer ass out of my chair !
she &apos;ll understand . i didn &apos;t do it on purpose .
dad , that won &apos;t matter to her .
look , all my stuff is safe and dry .
and all her stuff is ...
... growing new stuff .
this is the kind of thing ...
... that makes her think you love me more than her .
my god . does she think that ?
can you blame her ?
i don &apos;t know .
we may have favored you unconsciously . you were a marvel .
the doctors said your mom couldn &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t want to hear it .
really ?
well , not right now .
monica came here for some memories . damn it , we &apos;ll give her some .
okay , grab ...
grab some boxes . we &apos;ll take stuff from mine ...
... and whatever we can pass off as hers , we &apos;ll put in there .
like , this . she could have made this .
sure .
and this , she could have won this .
this could have been hers .
sure .
here , what about this ?
your makeup kit ?
i &apos;d feel better .
i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself .
yeah . me too .
hey , how &apos;s the miracle chair ?
fine .
you know , this thing has speakers in the headrest ?
no , really ?
yeah .
you can hook it to the tv and you get radio .
my chair heals itself .
earl , you &apos;re not hearing me . all i &apos;m saying is , you &apos;re not alone , all right ?
everybody hates the people they work with .
hey , guy .
wait , that sounded like someone being nice to you .
no , that &apos;s just the &quot; hey , guy &quot; guy .
he says that to everybody . he &apos;s the worst .
i &apos;d like to take him with me .
all right . let &apos;s just forget about the people at the office , okay ?
there &apos;s gotta be someone won &apos;th sticking around for .
what about family or friends ? maybe a girlfriend ?
yeah , right .
oh , sorry . boyfriend ?
oh , god .
no , whatever . anything .
hey , guy .
yeah , he &apos;s gotta go .
okay , i should ...
... be getting back to my thing now .
see you .
i &apos;m not finished ! don &apos;t you dare hang up on me !
the new girl &apos;s good .
hey , guys .
i just whipped us up some easy @-@ bake treats . they should be ready in about three days .
that &apos;s a good one ! you hear that , ross ? three days !
oh , this &apos;ll make a great memory .
okay .
which boxes are mine ?
these are yours right here .
okay .
a coloring book .
you loved that thing .
you never went anywhere without ...
... without that coloring book .
really ?
looks like i had trouble staying in the lines .
nuh @-@ uh !
an old glove ?
yeah , you loved that glove .
you took it every place you went . you never went anyplace without the glove .
wow , look at this .
i can &apos;t believe i even fit into this shirt .
oh , this is yours .
i don &apos;t know how that got in there .
this isn &apos;t mine .
hey , this isn &apos;t my stuff .
ross , these are your boxes .
where are my boxes ?
your boxes are ...
what ?
dad ?
the garage flooded , sweetie , and ruined your boxes . i &apos;m sorry .
just mine ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
why wasn &apos;t ross &apos; stuff ruined ?
and if you say the words &quot; medical marvel , &quot; i &apos;m going to easy @-@ bake your head .
i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche .
ross &apos; stuff is fine , but i have no memories ...
... so you could keep the bottom of your car from water ?
there was also leaves and gook and stuff .
i can &apos;t believe this !
screw it . i &apos;m having one .
hey , chandler .
hey .
how &apos;d you like to sit in a chair that reclines ...
... has a rolling massage ...
... and speakers in the headrest ?
i &apos;ve tried that so many times ...
... they won &apos;t even let me in the store anymore .
what if i said you could do it in my apartment ?
are you telling me ...
... you bought the chair that makes all others obsolete ?
the chair that sit magazine called &quot; chair of the year &quot; ?
i just purchased ...
... the la @-@ z @-@ boy e @-@ cliner 3000 .
well , that &apos;s awesome ! that &apos;s great ! what made you do it ?
it &apos;s a long story , but , i broke joey &apos;s chair ...
whoa , whoa , whoa . you broke joey &apos;s chair ?
i thought i did , that &apos;s why i replaced it with mine .
that &apos;s how it got fixed !
you thought that elves came in and fixed it ?
no .
angels .
i &apos;m getting my chair back .
well , looks like it wasn &apos;t healed after all !
i guess this chair &apos;s mine now .
joey , you broke my chair !
your chair ?
he thought he broke it , so he switched chairs .
so there was no miracle ?
no , joe . no miracle .
oh , no ! this is devastating !
my faith is shaken . i &apos;m glad i have a new chair to get me through this .
nice try , but you don &apos;t get that chair anymore .
that is my chair now . you can sit on my lap .
no , i take that back !
i think i should get the chair .
how do you figure ?
you broke a chair and you broke a chair .
the only one here that hasn &apos;t broken a chair is me .
no , no , no . this chair &apos;s not going anywhere .
where &apos;s the logic in that ?
the logic ...
... is that there are two of us ...
... and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half .
so joey breaks my chair , and i get nothing ?
that &apos;s right .
what are you guys , like , a gang or something ?
yeah , we are .
we &apos;re the cobras .
where can i find earl ? he &apos;s the supply manager here .
i don &apos;t know any earl .
i &apos;m right here !
earl ?
i &apos;m phoebe .
phoebe ?
the lady who sells toner ?
look , you can &apos;t kill yourself .
look , i really appreciate you coming down ...
no , i can &apos;t let you do it .
why ?
because , fate made me call you today .
i thought it was toner .
think about it , okay ? this isn &apos;t even my regular job .
my first day , you &apos;re my first call .
somebody else may have hung up , but i wouldn &apos;t do that ...
... because i know about this stuff .
my mom killed herself .
really ?
how ?
i &apos;m not gonna give you tips .
don &apos;t you see that this ...
... all came together so i could stop you from doing this ?
couldrt it just be a coincidence ?
no , it &apos;s fate .
it doesn &apos;t really seem like enough to be fate .
oh , well .
okay , here &apos;s a weird thing .
my mother was also a supply manager .
i &apos;m actually the office manager .
oh , my god ! so was she !
and get this , okay .
your name is earl , right ? her name was pearl .
puh @-@ earl .
was there anything else ?
sure .
where &apos;re you from ?
philadelphia .
oh , my god , so was she !
i &apos;ve got goose bumps .
really ?
i &apos;m wearing layers , and it &apos;s warm .
these jerks might not care about you ...
... but the universe does , and that says a lot .
did you hear that ?
i don &apos;t need you guys to care about me ...
... because the universe cares !
the whole universe !
i really wish they &apos;d care a little bit .
you know , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s you . this is a freaky place .
hey , guys !
oh , no , it &apos;s you .
yeah .
oh , this is terrible .
everything is destroyed .
look at this .
it meant enough for me to save , and now i can &apos;t tell what it is .
it &apos;s still soft .
what do you think this is ?
i think it was a mouse .
how are you , honey ?
how do you think i am ?
you &apos;ve wrecked my childhood memories ...
... you love ross more than me .
and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face .
sweetheart , we love you just as much as ross .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened ...
... and i probably can &apos;t make it up to you ...
... but here &apos;s a start .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s the key to my porsche .
well , the key to your porsche .
what ?
what ? !
i &apos;ve considered getting rid of it . i saw my reflection the other day .
your mother &apos;s right , i do look like an ass .
you &apos;re giving it to me ? you &apos;re kidding .
well , wait a minute .
a couple of stupid boxes get wet , and she gets a porsche ?
let &apos;s take a drive ?
all right !
what about me ? i &apos;m a medical marvel !
hey , guys .
have you seen chandler &apos;s chair ?
joey broke it . he got rid of it .
are you kidding ? i get a porsche and the barcalounger &apos;s gone ?
