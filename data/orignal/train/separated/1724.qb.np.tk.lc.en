第七季 第二集
and here &apos;s another interesting weather fact .
another ? great !
changes in jet streams can affect the speed
at which the earth rotates on its axis ,
so bad weather can actually make the day longer .
well , there must be a hell of a storm somewhere .
joke if you must ,
but you &apos;re going to miss these moments .
with leonard home in a few days ,
this was your last time driving me to the grocery store .
you know , i will miss this .
i &apos;ll tell you what , if my apples are mealy ,
we &apos;ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout .
heck , you can even push the cart .
please don &apos;t take my looking forward to leonard &apos;s return
as criticism of the job you &apos;ve been doing in his absence .
i won &apos;t .
that criticism will come later in your report card .
yeah , i didn &apos;t stay for the detention ,
i &apos;m not gonna read the report card .
hello .
leonard !
shh , shh .
hi !
keep your voice down .
oh , my god .
you weren &apos;t supposed to be here till sunday !
we finished the experiment early ,
so i thought i &apos;d come home and surprise you .
oh , my gosh , why are we whispering ?
i didn &apos;t tell sheldon ,
so we could have a few days alone .
oh , that is so romantic .
uh , sure , that &apos;s why i did it .
oh ... i just cannot believe you &apos;re here .
penny , it &apos;s your lucky day !
three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo .
grab your keys .
uh , stuart , i was wondering
if you could help me find something .
happy to ,
unless it &apos;s hope or a reason to live .
oh , you make me laugh , sad clown .
anyhoo ...
leonard will be back in a couple days
and i need a welcome @-@ home gift for him .
as he &apos;s been at sea , perhaps something
with a nautical theme might be appropriate .
okay , well , i don &apos;t know how much you want to spend ,
but i do have this pretty cool aquaman statue .
aquaman ?
oh , this isn &apos;t a gag gift , stuart .
yeah , just as well .
it &apos;s a pretty rare piece .
i &apos;d rather just sell it to a real collector .
i &apos;m a real collector .
how rare is it ?
oh , i shouldn &apos;t even have mentioned it .
how about a batman squirt gun ?
don &apos;t try and trick me
into buying something i don &apos;t want .
now let &apos;s talk aquaman .
what were they thinking , putting doctor octopus &apos;s mind
in spider @-@ man &apos;s body ?
well , i &apos;ve been quite enjoying that .
it combines all the superhero fun of spider @-@ man
with all the body @-@ switching shenanigans of freaky friday .
&quot; both versions : original and lohan . &quot;
&quot; both versions : original and lohan . &quot;
you &apos;re an idiot .
hey , what &apos;s your problem ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;ve been kind of snippy lately .
it &apos;s probably this stupid diet i &apos;m on .
why are you on a diet ?
i &apos;ve put on a couple pounds .
had to buy these pants in the men &apos;s section .
well , we &apos;ve all seen your mom .
that butterball turkey
was bound to come home to roost .
$ 1,200 ! that &apos;s my final offer !
all right , sheldon , you win .
i &apos;m sure leonard is gonna love this .
oh , right , a present for leonard .
you better throw in that squirt gun .
yeah , i don &apos;t know .
this squirt gun , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s pretty rare .
and this is me doing the titanic pose on the boat .
and ... oh .
that &apos;s me getting rescued after i fell in .
oh , that &apos;s the pizza .
yep .
here &apos;s some money .
thank you .
and i &apos;m gonna hit the head .
that &apos;s what us salty sea dogs say
when we have to go pee @-@ pee .
$ 22.50 .
okay , here &apos;s , uh , $ 25 . keep the change .
seriously ?
i just walked up , like , four flights of stairs .
okay .
well , here &apos;s , um ...
30 @-@ something cents
and a promise i won &apos;t call your boss
and tell him you reek of marijuana .
oh , penny , i see you &apos;ve ordered pizza .
i have chinese food .
that &apos;s nice .
oh , that &apos;s a rather earthy cologne .
my uncle used to wear that .
perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together
before leonard returns .
yeah , thanks ,
but i kind of feel like eating alone tonight , so ...
are you sure ?
with your italian pizza and my chinese noodles ,
we could play marco polo .
i mean , of course , a reenactment of a meal
in the life of marco polo the venetian explorer ,
not marco polo the terrifying water sport .
其他人就得喊 &quot; 波罗 &quot; 听音辨位
uh , yeah , it sounds fun , but no thanks .
have a good night !
what , now ... do you have company ?
no . no , no , no .
you know what ? th @-@ the toilet &apos;s been doing that .
i called the building manager , so ...
oh , i can take a look at it .
i &apos;m quite familiar with plumbing .
not to brag ,
but i spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet .
yeah , no , no , no .
you know what , sheldon , it &apos;s okay .
you don &apos;t have to go into the bathroom .
that &apos;s curious .
if there &apos;s no one here ,
why are there two glasses of wine on the table ?
oh .
well , you know , i @-@ i &apos;ve got two hands
and a bit of a drinking problem .
of course .
ask a silly question .
that &apos;s odd .
um , what ?
there are takeout containers in the trash can .
so ? that &apos;s my dinner from last night .
what &apos;s odd is they &apos;re in the trash can .
okay .
look , honey , i promise there &apos;s no one &apos;s here .
i &apos;ve had a long day .
i just want to have a quiet dinner by myself .
oh , very well .
i &apos;m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude .
oh !
what ?
have you gotten leonard a welcome @-@ home gift yet ?
no .
oh , great .
do you want to go halfsies on a $ 200 squirt gun ?
hi , honey .
i made some brownies . you want one ?
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
i mean , you know
i &apos;m trying to lose weight .
god , i thought we were partners in this marriage .
we are . stop it .
and for the last time , you &apos;re not fat .
really ? tell that to the bathroom scale ,
&apos;cause one of you is lying .
fine , forget i asked .
how was dinner at your mom &apos;s ?
awful .
i had to rub her ointment all over her again .
why can &apos;t she do it ?
&apos;cause we &apos;ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship .
which reminds me ,
do you think you can get any samples of this from work ?
this was supposed to last her a month ,
but they didn &apos;t take into account
the square footage of her back .
let me see .
how long have you been putting this on her ?
i don &apos;t know .
few weeks . why ?
this is really strong estrogen cream .
please tell me you &apos;ve been wearing gloves .
like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves .
howie , the estrogen &apos;s getting absorbed by your skin .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been
all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass .
you &apos;re full of estrogen and you don &apos;t act like that .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m a woman .
i &apos;ve had years of practice riding the dragon .
fine .
i &apos;ll wear gloves next time .
it &apos;s still gonna take a few weeks
for the hormones to leave your system .
i feel so stupid .
and fat .
it &apos;s okay .
you still look great to me .
in fact , why don &apos;t we go in the bedroom
and i &apos;ll prove it to you ?
sex ? really ?
i mean , that &apos;s just your solution to everything !
oh , and here &apos;s a fun thing .
i worked it out so that there are
two different words for spoon :
&quot; planko &quot; and &quot; janko . &quot;
&quot; planko &quot; is a spoon with food ,
&quot; janko &quot; is a spoon without food .
&quot; janko &quot; is spelled with a silent &quot; ptang . &quot;
sheldon , you &apos;re not even listening
to the rules of my made @-@ up language .
yes , i am .
then what does &quot; tweepadock &quot; mean ?
elephant ?
lucky guess .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just distracted by something that happened over at penny &apos;s .
what happened ?
i fear penny is being unfaithful to leonard .
what ?
she claimed to be alone
when there was obviously someone else in her apartment .
i have no choice but to assume the worst ,
given leonard &apos;s lengthy sea voyage
and her famously ravenous nether regions .
i don &apos;t think penny would cheat on leonard .
oh , really ?
she and i once had a staring contest .
she clapped really loud and made me blink .
it &apos;s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity .
you &apos;re being ridiculous .
amy , there were chinese food containers ...
in the trash can .
poor leonard .
do you hear anything ?
i hear a woman &apos;s voice .
is it penny ?
no , it &apos;s you .
all right , i hear whispering and giggling .
now i think i hear kissing .
yeah , like you know what kissing sounds like .
there &apos;s kissing in star trek , smarty @-@ pants .
let me listen .
sounds like leonard .
please .
why would leonard come home early
and waste his time kissing penny
when he could be hanging out with his best buddy ?
yeah , that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m catching her in the act .
no , sheldon , don &apos;t .
aha !
what the hell ? !
leonard ?
sheldon , you cannot just barge in here like that !
right .
penny !
penny ! penny !
are you going to answer the door
or should i open it and say &quot; aha &quot; again ?
i &apos;m sorry , sheldon .
i should &apos;ve told you i was back .
i just wanted to have a couple days alone with penny .
oh , no , i should apologize .
uh , i never realized to what extent
our friendship was a burden to you .
that is not fair .
i complain about what a burden it is at least once a month .
oh , no , no , let &apos;s not sugarcoat this .
you find me finicky , pedantic and annoying .
no , he doesn &apos;t .
i actually have used those exact words before .
in that order .
well , leonard , i think it &apos;s high time
you and i address the &quot; tweepadock &quot; in the room .
the what ?
amy ?
please leave me out of this .
uh ... fine .
leonard ,
there &apos;s no need for you
to pretend to like me anymore .
come on , i said i was sorry .
no , no , you save your apologies
for after you &apos;ve had disappointing coitus with penny .
it was fine .
come on , this is silly .
hey , um , i brought you back
a little present from my trip , huh ?
it &apos;s that sailor cap that you wanted .
it &apos;s neat , huh ?
you honestly think you can buy back my friendship
with a cheap souvenir ?
i don &apos;t .
no , i really don &apos;t .
just try it on .
oh , yeah .
hello , sailor .
- ooh , now we &apos;re talking .
excuse me .
this changes nothing .
except the halloween costume
i &apos;m wearing this year .
amy , you &apos;re going to be olive oyl .
lay off the donuts .
thanks for coming over .
no problem .
ooh , you made little sandwiches !
yeah , that &apos;s cucumber and cream cheese .
that &apos;s turkey and loganberry .
and don &apos;t tell my hips , but i &apos;m warming up a brie in the oven .
nice . so ...
mmm . what &apos;s up ?
okay , well , i &apos;ve been reading up on all the side effects
you can get from estrogen ,
and ...
i need you to be honest with me .
do my boobs look bigger to you ?
well , it &apos;s kind of hard to tell .
come on , raj , it &apos;s a &quot; yes or no &quot; question .
i &apos;m not sure .
um , wait .
jump up and down-- let &apos;s see if they jiggle .
uh , no , i ...
i still can &apos;t tell , uh ...
oh , you know what ? okay , uh , give me some of this .
seriously ?
do you want my help or not ?
fine .
okay , yup .
see , see , that @-@ that looks like ...
that looks like they could be bigger .
but you know , i bet ... i bet when i do it ,
mine do the same thing .
yeah , they kind of do .
hmm . uh , let me see something .
hey , easy !
my nipples are sensitive .
sorry , sorry , uh ...
okay .
i mean ...
yeah , m @-@ maybe .
okay , let me feel .
no , i am definitely up a cup size .
you know , b @-@ but they &apos;re very firm ,
so you &apos;ve got that going for you .
you think ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , very perky .
thank you .
i really needed to hear that today .
ooh , brie &apos;s ready !
yay !
good morning .
hello .
so am i driving you to work
or are you still mad at me ?
i &apos;d like a ride .
assuming you actually do take me to work .
where do you think i would take you ?
who knows ?
uh , you said you &apos;d be home yesterday ,
but you came home three days ago .
you say you &apos;re taking me to work ,
but for all i know ,
i &apos;ll end up in a deserted amusement park .
or a cornfield maze .
or a back alley dog fight .
you tell me .
i &apos;m going to work .
you can come if you want .
okay .
by the way , you have something on your shirt .
no , i don &apos;t .
hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
you know , i find myself wondering
if anything you &apos;ve ever told me is true .
i didn &apos;t make it back .
the ship sank , i &apos;m in hell .
you say you &apos;re from new jersey , but how can i believe you ?
why would anyone claim to be from new jersey
if they weren &apos;t ?
all right , i &apos;ll give you that one .
hey , i said i was sorry .
what else do you want from me ?
i want you to admit that what you did was wrong .
fine .
what i did was wrong .
i wish i could believe you .
you know what ?
i &apos;m not driving you to work ,
because you &apos;re incredibly annoying .
you say one thing and do the other ,
so then you are driving me and you find me a delight .
stop it .
keep it up ?
bye !
hello !
so i guess you &apos;re really holding up the other four fingers ?
oh , hey , what are you doing here so early ?
driving sheldon to work .
he &apos;s still mad at leonard , huh ?
well , he &apos;s mad at you , too .
he says you &apos;re the succubus who led his friend astray .
i don &apos;t know what &quot; succubus &quot; is , but ...
it has &quot; suck &quot; in it , so that can &apos;t be good .
thought i heard you out here .
hey , sheldon .
you don &apos;t get a &quot; hey . &quot;
you get a &quot; hmm . &quot;
come on , don &apos;t be like that .
we had so much fun together the last couple of months .
you &apos;re right .
which makes your betrayal all the more devastating .
sheldon ...
i let you buy feminine hygiene products
with my supermarket club card .
you have any idea the kind of coupons
i &apos;m going to get in the mail now ?
sheldon , your fight &apos;s with leonard .
penny &apos;s got nothing to do ...
careful , amy .
the friend of my enemy &apos;s girlfriend is my enemy .
really ?
yes .
you &apos;re either with me or against me .
you want to take the bus to work ?
maybe there &apos;s a third option .
fyi , i had a doughnut for breakfast , you jerk .
so now we &apos;re just waiting for the data
from the ship to be crunched ,
but the numbers look pretty promising .
that &apos;s so great .
if you guys prove the existence of unruh radiation ...
hey , hey , hey , hey !
my eyes are up here .
howard , raj .
judas .
you know what ?
you &apos;re a crazy person .
a crazy person with a long memory ,
and if all goes according to plan , a robot army .
stop it .
or a mutant army .
it depends on how my kickstarter goes .
i said , stop it !
now , listen to me .
you two aren &apos;t just friends .
you &apos;re best friends .
and that &apos;s a beautiful thing .
i mean , leonard , you know why he &apos;s so mad at you ?
it &apos;s &apos; cause he missed you !
yeah , and as his friend ,
you should be happy
he has love in his life .
as i do .
this man held my breast the other day ,
and i love him for it .
a little loud , dude .
so , can we please put aside these petty differences
and just be glad we &apos;re here together ?
okay .
i suppose so .
thank you .
uh , it wasn &apos;t anything weird .
it was just to see how big they were .
and then leonard took me to the barber and the dentist ,
and then to cap off the perfect day ,
the los angeles bureau of weights and measures .
i thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show ;
turns out it was the weights .
i &apos;m so glad you guys are friends again .
and i &apos;m glad you and i are friends again , too .
aw . which reminds me .
this came in the mail , and i want you to have it .
&quot; 50 cents off vagisil . &quot;
think of me when you apply it .
uh , can i just say ,
i &apos;ve missed all of us hanging out together .
yeah .
me , too .
um , since when can koothrappali talk
in front of the girls without a beer ?
oh , that happened right after you left .
and no one told me ?
can &apos;t believe we forgot to tell him .
think of sheldon when you apply it .
