&quot; readiness is all &quot;
they hit you out of nowhere .
what happened ?
we were arguing .
he kept saying that he couldn &apos;t trust me anymore ,
that i was a liar , that i ...
that i lied about how i was .
he hit you ?
god , it just got so bad .
when bad things come , they come suddenly , without warning .
don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen now .
nothing gonna happen . you &apos;re safe .
all right ? you &apos;re safe here .
you just need to get some sleep .
all right ? just try and sleep .
if you need anything ...
i &apos;ll have my cell .
where are you going ?
we rarely get to see the catastrophe coming ...
alex , what are you gonna do ? !
make sure that &apos;s covered , and make sure ...
no matter how we try to prepare for it .
what is all these ?
weather report says a massive storm is coming .
hurricane force winds and heavy rain ,
they say it &apos;s three days out .
so we have time to prepare , then .
exactly .
so for the e.r. , we &apos;re gonna need to overstock
supplies and blood products .
let &apos;s get ready for double capacity intakes .
that means extra beds and gurneys in the hallways .
this storm will bring in a lot of casalities .
we &apos;re gonna need to make room for them ,
so let &apos;s discharge all patients that can be .
post @-@ op and long @-@ term patients
are gonna be transferred to seattle pres further inland .
we &apos;re gonna bring in supplementals--
water , food , meds , lighting .
uh , we &apos;re gonna be checking
and refueling the backup generators .
as for you surgeons ,
push , postpone , or cancel all elective procedures
until after this storm ...
so we &apos;re canceling surgeries now ?
well , you can afford to slow down a little bit .
i &apos;m pregnant . i &apos;m not sick .
you &apos;re very pregnant .
you &apos;re three weeks away from your due date .
shepherd .
yeah .
i need your help . come with me .
there will be a list of available surgeons ...
so you &apos;ve got your craniofacial baby .
are you gonna postpone ?
no , he said elective .
the kid &apos;s got his brain on his face .
don &apos;t snap . i was just wondering if maybe--
well , we have three days .
most importantly , we &apos;re gonna need to print hard copies
of all computerized patient charts
in case of a power loss .
all of them ?
do we have time to--
i &apos;ll do that .
bailey , it &apos;s good to have you back .
i &apos;ll put you on the o.r. rotation .
uh , i mean i &apos;ll do the charts .
folks , they &apos;re saying that this is going to be a bad one ,
but we have three days to prepare .
so let &apos;s do it and be ready when the storm hits .
thank you .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she feels like she can &apos;t go into an o.r.
she thinks she &apos;ll kill anyone she touches .
i @-@ i tried to convince her to come down to l.a. with me ,
take some time off ,
but then we heard about the storm ,
and she said she had to stay and help .
anything i can do ?
i wish there was , but honestly ...
anyone but me .
i know .
i brought him in a few hours ago .
he had a c.t.
i wanted to wait for you .
you gotta help him .
it &apos;s chest peckwell . i mean , jason myers .
so between removing the encephalocele
and closing up the facial cleft ...
it is gonna take most of the day .
you guys have any questions ?
uh , n @-@ no .
i guess not . no .
i would tell you not to worry ,
but that &apos;s a load of crap . you &apos;ll worry .
but if it helps ,
i &apos;m not worried a bit .
it does help .
a lot . thank you .
so you knew exactly what to say to her .
is that a mom thing ?
oh . the internet told you i was a mom , too , huh ?
oh , god . okay , all right .
apparently , i &apos;m super creepy &apos; cause i know everything about you .
well , i &apos;m creepy , too , because the internet told me
that you studied with bud clement ,
and i did a year under him at hopkins .
bud ? i mean , he &apos;s a genius .
yeah . but oh , my god ...
his breath .
his breath is so bad .
something died in him .
it did .
all right . well , this changes everything .
i mean , if you studied under clement ,
then i &apos;ll have you do the calvarial graft
and i &apos;ll just focus on the bipartition .
cool ?
really ? yay .
yeah , yay .
do you want to go get coffee before we start this ?
um ... uh , y--uh , yeah .
i have to get some stuff done .
so i will , um , i &apos;ll meet you--
i &apos;ll meet you up there .
okay .
i mean , you &apos;re probably just gonna go
cyber stalk me some more , huh ?
i might be .
creepy .
i understand it .
if my dad doesn &apos;t wake up , i go live with strangers .
hey , hey , hey , not strangers .
a foster family .
people who want to take care of you
and are more ... more prepared to do that
than your grandma is right now .
will they play soccer ?
i hope so .
what if they don &apos;t ?
what if they &apos;re like the people from &quot; harry potter &quot; ?
like , gross , mean , and scary ?
they-- they won &apos;t be , all right ?
i promise .
but if my dad wakes up ,
i could stay with him , right ?
yeah , if he wakes up .
ethan , honey .
oh , eat your yogurt .
okay . well , i &apos;ll see you , all right ?
and don &apos;t worry .
okay .
page me if anything changes .
owen .
nancy and i had a conversation
about withdrawal of care .
i did not bring it up . she did .
she wanted to know what the chances are after nine days--
it is way too soon to talk about pulling the plug .
and i told her
since he &apos;s gone eight days without improvement ,
the neurological deficits are more likely be permanent .
of course you did .
i wasn &apos;t gonna lie , owen .
she doesn &apos;t want to put her son through any more , or her--
it &apos;s too soon .
get another head c.t. , a c.b.c. , and a chem panel .
we just drew blood this morning .
i know . do it again .
can i ask you something ?
s--yeah .
when you and derek adopted zola ,
how did you know ?
i mean , how did you really know
that that was something you were gonna do ?
why ? are you thinking ...
yeah , forget it .
just forget it .
clear the hallways for cots .
people will come looking for shelter .
how bad is this supposed to be ?
hope for the best , prepare for the worst , right ?
what do we got ?
39 @-@ year @-@ old construction worker .
wind blew him off a building .
fell four storie to impale himself
on three bars of standing rebar .
vitals are stable .
minimal blood loss on the scene .
maintaining airway .
okay . let &apos;s go .
let his name be bob .
please let his name be bob .
why ?
shishka @-@ bob .
my name &apos;s leon .
the patient &apos;s awake and responsive .
oh , my god . i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s bad , huh ?
this is really bad ? am i gonna die ?
the fact that we &apos;re talking right now , leon ,
means it &apos;s not as bad as it could be .
i guess so .
if these bars hadn &apos;t caught me ,
i &apos;d be a stain on the pavement right now .
that &apos;s the attitude , leon .
just keep that up , okay ?
let &apos;s get him to the o.r. and we &apos;ll take x @-@ rays there .
page grey and torres .
kepner , kepner .
what ?
i &apos;ll take this .
why ? why ? i caught it .
it &apos;s a big case , and i need you on--
yes , it is a big case . it &apos;s my big case .
hey , i @-@ i am about to take my oral boards again ,
and this is exactly the kind of case
that i want them to see that i can handle
because i am going to crush them this year .
i need you on storm prep .
and you once told me that i should
stop being an administrator and start being a surgeon .
and that &apos;s my human shish kebab .
okay . all right . i hear you . go .
thank you .
now i will check in on you .
if things get hairy , i &apos;m tagging you out .
you won &apos;t have to !
nurse cano to e.r.
nurse sandy cano to e.r.
what happened ?
what does it look like ?
brooks , what do you see ?
like , someone super messed him up .
talk like a doctor .
um , temporal bone fracture
with an epidural hemorrhage .
how soon does the bleed need to be evacuated ?
like , yesterday .
yeah , book an o.r.
let &apos;s get him up there .
karev , what the hell happened ?
who did this ?
make sure he doesn &apos;t die .
you can &apos;t let him die , okay ?
this one &apos;s sitting right next to the carotid ,
but it doesn &apos;t seem to have damaged it .
this one &apos;s in the right upper quadrant .
and according to the ultrasound ,
it might have missed the liver .
the ultrasound on this one
showed the femoral artery is intact , for now .
these bars are rough metal . when we take them out ,
we risk shredding the vessels .
he could bleed out .
doctors , he &apos;s starting to lose his airway .
i need to intubate .
okay , i want to cut down the protruding bars as close as possible
to minimize the damage when we pull them out .
bone cutter ?
maybe .
uh , doubtful .
nope .
1 / 2 @-@ inch rebar .
you &apos;re gonna want a 4 @-@ 1 / 2 @-@ inch angle grinder
with a cutoff wheel .
thank you , leon .
no worries .
okay , run . do not walk .
chest peckwell ? jo &apos;s chest peckwell ?
karev brought him in beat to hell .
he has a brain bleed .
karev brought him in ?
yeah . i think that he &apos;s
do you have a 4 @-@ 1 / 2 @-@ inch angle grinder with a cutoff wheel ?
dr. bailey , i &apos;m thrilled that you &apos;re back
and honored that you requested me .
i &apos;m very excited to be in your o.r.
so what are we doing ?
press &quot; print , &quot; go to the printer ,
take the chart , collate it , repeat .
we &apos;re doing this , then ?
you need me to go over it again ?
but bailey tested negative for staph .
and she knows that , but she doesn &apos;t feel it .
this way . this way .
murphy . murphy .
where are you going with that ?
o.r. one kepner needs to cut the excess rebar
off of shish kabob leon .
all right .
come on .
where were we , uh oh , yeah , bailey .
right . uh , yeah , i just think that she needs to ...
um , are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
yeah . yeah .
whoa ! whoa ! stop ! stop ! stop ! shut it off ! shut it off !
you can &apos;t grind metal . the room is full of oxygen .
the grinder &apos;s gonna give off sparks .
you &apos;ll blow up the room .
oh , god . okay .
yeah , good call .
i &apos;ve , uh , been through something like this before .
and how &apos;d that work out ?
not great .
oh , you &apos;re early .
so are you .
well , i kind of like to oversee the prep .
me , too . feel free to join me ,
&apos;cause clearly , you &apos;re a control freak .
well , nothing wrong with that
since clearly , you &apos;re a bigger one .
it &apos;s exhausting , isn &apos;t it ?
god , yes .
i &apos;m surprised you &apos;re letting me do any of the reconstruction .
i figure , the more people know how to do this ,
the safer for kids everywhere .
it &apos;s kind of my way of controlling the world .
and this way , you have something to remember me by .
well , every time i tuck a baby &apos;s brain back into his skull ,
i will think
you are gonna think of me .
that &apos;s the idea .
here we go , right ?
here we go .
the metal &apos;s laying on two major vessels .
they &apos;ll shred if we try and pull the entire bar through .
you &apos;re right . but i &apos;m damned if i know how to do it , though .
can we take out the oxygen tanks ?
well , the tanks , yes , but there are o2 outputs in the floor ,
there and there .
i say we take him down to a patient room , do it there .
he &apos;s already under anesthesia ,
and he &apos;s too unstable to move .
all right , all right . how about this ?
get all additional oxygen tanks out .
i manually hyperventilate him , get him on 100 % o2,
and then i shut off the vent . you cut .
when he runs out of air , you stop ,
i hyperventilate him again .
that &apos;ll take forever .
and it &apos;s still risky , but
it &apos;s our best shot .
all right . just give me the grinder , and you can go .
all right , knox , you can go , too . i got this .
this is dangerous work , people . so everybody out .
i &apos;ll stay .
you &apos;ll need someone to hold the bar steady while you cut .
and you &apos;ll need me to irrigate the metal .
the grinder will heat up
and could burn through the vessels .
that &apos;s very good thinking .
there may be liver damage .
no , grey , not you . you go .
because i &apos;m pregnant ?
she has a kid .
she didn &apos;t bring hers to the o.r. with her today .
he &apos;s got a point , grey . you should go .
grey .
go . that &apos;s an order .
okay , let &apos;s gown up and wet down these drapes .
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
why am i being kicked out of my o.r. ?
owen hunt just kicked me out of my o.r.
for being pregnant .
he what ?
excuse us .
well , there was a chance that it could explode ,
and it &apos;s--it is incredibly dangerous .
oh , well , i &apos;m on board with that , then .
check with karev .
he brought in a friend with a brain bleed .
guy was beaten half to death . jason myers from o.b.
it &apos;s not his friend .
these are today &apos;s scans ?
with smaller cuts , like you asked .
wait .
what is that ?
we have a problem .
mer , check out this hyperdensity .
is that something or just noise on the film ?
that looks real to me . it &apos;s alex .
get a c.t. angio and find me .
i want to look at those vessels .
okay .
all right . i &apos;ll hyperventilate him .
when we get to 100 % ,
i &apos;ll say go , you cut .
we watch his sats drop to 90 % .
below 90 % , there could be tissue damage .
even brain damage , so at 90 % ,
i &apos;ll say stop and i &apos;ll pump him up again .
you ready ?
ready .
ready .
and if anybody sees any sparks ,
then run like hell , understood ?
yeah .
okay .
okay .
go .
oh , my god .
sparks ! ! whoa ! whoa !
everybody okay ? everybody all right ?
torres ?
fine . yep . let &apos;s do this .
okay , kepner , if you &apos;re someone who still prays , maybe--
dear lord , please be with us right now .
help us save this man , help us save leon .
in your name , we pray . amen .
and ... go .
let &apos;s move to the abdomen .
okay .
all right . go .
oh , sparks !
sparks ! oh ! oh , my--oh ! oh !
ben , look ! oh , god ! oh , god ! oh , god !
no , we &apos;re good . we &apos;re good . we &apos;re good . go .
go , go .
okay .
oh , damn it . the c.s.f. is leaking .
this is worse than i thought .
the crack has torn the dura .
it &apos;s pretty grody .
&quot; grody &quot; is not a thing we say .
list the possible complications .
um , death , that &apos;s pretty solid .
strokes , re @-@ clots , being a potato ,
goofiness , loopiness , simpletonism .
brooks .
difficulty with speech , memory , and vision .
why are you making me talk so much today ?
because you &apos;re weird , and it bugs me .
but you also have a natural talent for this .
and the weirdness is there because you &apos;re covering up
a real lack of confidence in your natural talent .
so now it is my job to make you feel confident
and less weird . okay ?
whatever twists your knickers .
i said fight the guy . i didn &apos;t mean fight the guy .
alex , this kind of stuff was okay when we first met you ,
but now ?
now you &apos;re supposed to be less stupid .
i mean , you could go to jail , your whole career--
look , i &apos;m not going to jail .
he was like that when i found him .
that &apos;s your story ?
no cop is gonna believe you .
alex , it &apos;s us . just tell us .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
he didn &apos;t do it .
he just found him .
i did it .
93 . 92 . 91 .
oh ...
oh , god . this is taking too long .
we &apos;ve have to get into the abdomen .
90 . hunt .
almost there .
almost there .
go !
stop ! no ! no ! no ! can &apos;t turn it on !
don &apos;t turn it on !
cover the body ! cover the body !
fire !
88 . he &apos;s getting hypoxic .
i got this .
ohh . okay , okay . okay , go .
god , good catch , kepner .
okay , all the bars are cut .
oh , god .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve got .
torres , you go scrub .
kepner , go back to the e.r.
what ?
i need you prepping for the storm .
wh--no , no , no , no .
you need another surgeon
for when we pull the rod out of his abdomen .
right , we &apos;re gonna be working on his neck
so we have some time .
send in grey or whoever &apos;s available .
kepner .
i &apos;ve got it . i &apos;ll find someone .
chief , he is my patient .
i have made every single right call since he came in here .
and what , you want me to stock shelves like some grocery clerk ?
i need you there more than i need you here .
kepner , i &apos;m not gonna ask you again .
go now !
nice .
mm .
i &apos;m gonna mark where i &apos;m making my cuts , arizona .
then you will mark
a 2x3 @-@ centimeter piece of the parietal for the graft .
dr. avery , dr. robbins is gonna do the calvarial graft ,
and then i thought i would walk you through
the reconstruction of the nose and the lip .
oh , i &apos;m fine to watch the master at work today .
come on , boswell .
it sounds like you &apos;re trying to get us to do all the work .
sounds to me like avery is chicken .
not what i said . you came out all this way .
well , he can run a hospital ,
but he &apos;s still a baby surgeon .
you &apos;re one of the grey @-@ sloan seven ?
is that a thing ?
yes , that &apos;s a thing .
you guys are legend .
you bought the hospital , saved the staff .
well , you know us control freaks .
we try to run everything .
it was brave . i couldn &apos;t have done it .
and i &apos;m so impressed .
and you , sir ,
are doing this reconstruction , okay ?
okay .
okay .
arizona , are you ready to mark your graft ?
yeah . yeah , let me in .
all right . come right over here next to me .
here , go through these again
and just make sure they &apos;re in order .
dr. bailey , is there a reason you chose me to do this ?
because you &apos;re an intern .
a surgical intern ,
at a hospital , not a kinko &apos;s .
just ... since dr. shepherd
kicked me off his service ,
i worry that everyone thinks i &apos;m a losing bet .
and if that &apos;s what people think--
do you want to be responsible for killing a patient , ross ?
if the power goes out ,
and we lose access to a patient &apos;s electronic files
and we reach for her chart in this pile
and it &apos;s not there ,
what will happen ?
well , that &apos;s pretty hypothetical ...
the patient would die , ross , and it would be your fault .
and how would you feel ?
i ...
how would you feel ?
uh , bailey .
hunt needs another hand in the o.r.
asked for you to scrub in .
uh , tell him i can &apos;t . storm &apos;s coming .
this needs to get done .
bailey .
i &apos;m in the middle of the backup charts .
if i stop , i &apos;ll lose the order .
he needs to get someone else .
i &apos;ll go .
i &apos;ll do it myself .
of course you will .
we were having a fight .
he--he grabbed my arm .
i fought him off .
it just--it got ugly .
he fell backwards and he hit his head on the fireplace ,
but he was still yelling when i left .
he was fine . i swear .
all right , you gotta go . go .
uh , no , she has to explain to them what happened .
no , nobody does anything until we see how peckwell is .
look , go home .
don &apos;t let anyone see you .
you two don &apos;t say a word to anybody
until we know exactly what &apos;s going on .
understand ?
are you okay ?
she &apos;s okay .
you never saw her . what ?
i have paul dawson &apos;s c.t. angio results .
great .
go .
don &apos;t do anything stupid .
oh , is that chest peckwell ?
h @-@ how is he ?
oh , a bad bleed .
we won &apos;t know more unti he wakes .
what the hell happened ?
i don &apos;t know . um , i need your help .
people keep saying that to me today .
i found that on paul dawson &apos;s scan .
could that be a clot that we missed ?
yeah , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
it &apos;s blocking blood flow to the basilar artery .
brooks ...
why would we miss that ?
oh , i &apos;m not asking her .
yeah , she &apos;s-- she &apos;s asking you .
and i &apos;m asking you .
because it &apos;s a thrombus ...
which is harder to see .
it &apos;s more common to find a bleed or an infarct .
you were looking for the wrong thing .
nice job .
could you take it out , like now ?
run a pipeline stent
and restore the blood flow to the basilar ?
i mean , could that wake him up ?
it could .
it could also kill him .
does the family want to take that risk ?
but , um , you--you said that yesterday .
you said it-- it was our last chance .
this is ... a long shot .
well , what does dr. hunt say ?
dr. hunt is in surgery , and paul is my patient .
and it &apos;s your decision .
nancy , every second counts now .
well , if there &apos;s a chance that ...
okay . okay .
wocka , wocka , wocka , wocka , wocka ,
wocka , wocka , wocka , wocka , wocka--
what are you doing ?
sorry . it &apos;s pac @-@ man .
because it looks like pac @-@ man .
now what do we need to watch out for ?
mm . dislodging the clot .
jamming the stent , or--
oh , damn it .
the basilar wall is dissecting .
it &apos;s just too weak .
if you don &apos;t place the stent , it could rupture , right ?
yeah . if we place it too fast--
you risk ripping the artery in half .
either way , he &apos;s-- he &apos;s dead .
good . yeah . just be quiet .
hey , wilson .
i &apos;m going , i swear . i just had to grab some clothes .
look ...
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to hurt jason .
i was just trying to get away from him .
and i lost it . i just lost it .
i like you .
but i love alex .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s dumb enough
or loyal enough to take the fall for you ,
but he just might be .
i &apos;d never let him do that . i wouldn &apos;t .
okay .
are they done with that in the o.r. ?
yeah , they were done a while ago .
then why aren &apos;t i back up there ?
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
help . help me .
okay .
okay .
okay .
dissecting is stopped . stent is in place . good .
any leaks ?
i &apos;m not sure .
yes or no , brooks .
confidence .
no , sir . no leaks .
good .
dr. shepherd , you have a message .
yeah , not now .
it &apos;s from dr. grey .
she took a fall on the stairs . she says she &apos;s okay ,
but she &apos;s going to o.b. to get checked .
i can finish . you should go .
no , you can &apos;t .
you &apos;re done .
hard part &apos;s over . i &apos;ll just , uh , retract the sheath ,
hold pressure on the femoral arteriotomy ,
done .
i can do it . go .
okay . here .
what ?
oh ! oh , no ! oh , no .
no , mousey .
mousey , no .
no , don &apos;t touch her . mousey , no !
bailey just said no ?
might be &apos; cause it was me who asked her .
no , i &apos;m telling you , she &apos;s just a little shaken up .
she needs a break .
you know , christina went through something similar ,
so i get it .
how about you pull out the bar ,
and i &apos;ll jump in and catch the bleeders ?
got it .
torres , a hand here .
you know it was the same with arizona .
you can &apos;t rush her back to work .
mm , that might be true ... for them .
forgive me , ben , but with someone like bailey--
sometimes you just need to rip off the band @-@ aid .
here we go .
okay . let &apos;s go .
yeah . gotcha .
that is a handsome face .
mm , very handsome .
i couldn &apos;t have done it any better myself .
well , i wouldn &apos;t have done it at all .
thank you . this was incredible .
oh , it was my pleasure .
now my downfall as a surgeon
is a very tiny bladder , so you guys have this .
i &apos;ll see you in just a second .
she is just one of those people , isn &apos;t she ?
what ? what do you mean ?
one of those people
that just make you feel like you &apos;re capable of anything .
sloan was like that .
he just sort of took for granted that you were great ...
so that you &apos;d be great .
i wish she could stick around a little longer .
i just--i have not felt like this in a long time .
yeah .
the baby &apos;s fine .
define &quot; fine . &quot;
and feel free to talk like a doctor .
fine means zero sign of placental abruption
or any injury to the fetus .
no bleeding , no uterine rupture .
his heart beat &apos;s great . no distress .
everything is where it should be .
you are incredibly lucky .
are you in any pain ?
no . uh , just--just sore .
if you start to feel any pain at all ,
you know where i am .
thank you , connie .
see , i told you , you need to slow down .
you know how we could have avoided this ?
if i &apos;d been safely in that exploding o.r. ,
where i should have been .
put your pants on .
i just closed a midline facial cleft .
primary surgeon .
what is wrong ?
i don &apos;t know .
hunt is actively keeping me from surgeries .
i don &apos;t know if he thinks that i &apos;m gonna fail my boards again ,
or maybe he &apos;s just finally realized
that i &apos;d make a better secretary than a surgeon .
so i &apos;ll talk to him .
no .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t . i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want you to fight for me .
dr. kepner , trauma &apos;s coming in .
great .
something else i can get kicked off of .

alex , what were you gonna do
if you got to peckwell &apos;s house first ?
were you gonna have coffee and talk it out ?
i mean , tell me he wouldn &apos;t have been worse off
had you gotten there first .
people change , but they don &apos;t change .
maybe jo &apos;s crazy fits your crazy .
don &apos;t give up on her just yet .
we didn &apos;t give up on you .
chest peckwell is awake .
how is he ?
he &apos;s fine .
but he &apos;s--he &apos;s asking for the police .
i thought this storm was coming in three days .
you know weather guys .
they &apos;re wrong most of the time , and they still keep their jobs .
how do you feel , honestly ?
honestly ?
i &apos;d feel better if the wall hadn &apos;t dissected .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s done more harm than good .
derek .
how did i miss this clot ?
you didn &apos;t , or it &apos;d still be in there .
you &apos;ve done everything you can .
then why isn &apos;t he awake ?
he looks beautiful .
yeah , and when he &apos;s 6 feet tall and has a full head of hair ,
all of this is gonna recede to just a tiny , little scar
on his forehead .
the girls are gonna love it .
it &apos;ll give him some mystery .
thank you ... so much .
amazing .
mm . this was an amazing day .
well , you guys did most of the work .
i &apos;m happy i just got to watch .
yeah , well , is there anything else that i can ...
you can show me to an on @-@ call room .
uh ... w @-@ why ?
first night post @-@ op , i like to stay close by
in case anything happens .
oh , wow , you poor , poor control freak .
oh , you really get me .
yeah . i really do .
this way .
hey , jason .
cops here yet ?
let &apos;s talk for a second .
she attacked me , all right ? jo &apos;s a lunatic .
she &apos;s disturbed , and she &apos;s a liar .
you got a good thing here ,
good job ,
nice place .
you have friends here ?
oh , you wanna be my friend now ?
me ? nah . i got enough friends .
cristina yang-- she &apos;s my friend .
she owns the hospital .
derek shepherd , owns the hospital .
meredith grey--her name &apos;s on the friggin &apos; door .
and these are my friends ,
and they don &apos;t like a guy who hits his girlfriend ,
neither do i.
she attacked me .
what was i supposed to do ?
you &apos;re supposed to take it .
a girl hits you , you take it , or you walk away .
it &apos;s the story of my life .
jason , you can tell this story till you &apos;re blue in the face ,
but all people are gonna hear is that you hit her .
and that little bit ,
it &apos;s gonna follow you around the halls here .
and if you leave ,
it &apos;ll get wherever you &apos;re going before you do .
oh , you &apos;ll make sure of that , huh ?
it sounds like you &apos;re blackmailing me .
it sounds like you &apos;re a guy who hits girls ,
&apos;cause you did .
so what do you wanna do next ?
what &apos;d he say ?
what , you heard that ?
i did .
you think it &apos;s okay to blackmail people , karev ?
i wasn &apos;t . it was just a threat .
you &apos;re threatening him ?
what are you thinking ?
a bunch of people got hurt here .
i didn &apos;t see the point in any more .
i mean , the guy &apos;s not pressing charges .
oh , so it all works out .
you feel good about that ?
because you shouldn &apos;t .
bailey , when the chief of surgery
orders you to scrub in on a surgery ,
you scrub in on that surgery .
the last i heard , you &apos;re not chief of surgery or my boss .
but i am part owner of this hospital ,
which does , in fact , make me your boss .
and you &apos;re not a file clerk ,
we have enough file clerks ,
but we need a surgeons .
so either be a surgeon ,
or get the hell out , &apos; cause we don &apos;t need you .
thank you very much .
he looks great .
he is . broken leg , minor internal injuries .
after all that , it turned out to be kind of a nothing case .
you had absolutely no right
to kick me out of that o.r. today .
grey , you weren &apos;t necessary that--
you did it because i &apos;m pregnant
and because you were trying to protect me .
yes . and ?
i just want you to know it &apos;s completely unacceptable ,
and thank you .
noted .
you asked me about zola today .
we just knew .
you know , derek knew first , of course ,
because he &apos;s derek .
and it took me a little longer
because i @-@ i was ... scared .
one day , i just picked her up ,
and ... i just knew .
i don &apos;t know how else to explain it .
i looked at her , and she was my daughter .
i just knew .
you know , this kid-- he needs someone .
and i like him ,
and , uh , and he likes me .
he &apos;s scared and alone and ...
and ... i could help .
i know how to help , and i want to .
and then i talk myself out of it
because he &apos;s not my kid .
he &apos;s 10 . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a huge commitment .
it &apos;s a lifetime of responsibility ,
and it pretty much uproots everything .
but then i spend one minute with this kid ,
and ... i can &apos;t imagine not doing it .
you &apos;re thinking i &apos;m crazy .
no .
i &apos;m thinking that &apos;s exactly the way i felt .
cristina won &apos;t get it .
owen . it &apos;s paul .
you should come .
he &apos;s awake .
he &apos;s fine . uh , neuro &apos;s good ,
he &apos;s talking .
he &apos;s fine .
get him set for transfer to seattle pres .
well , isn &apos;t that a little--
i want them out of here a.s.a.p.
the storm &apos;s here sooner than predicted ,
and i want them moved inland before it gets worse .
i &apos;ve rounded on your entire service .
brooks , thanks .
you &apos;ve stepped up when i needed it today .
i &apos;m proud of you .
thank you , sir .
give it up .
slamma @-@ jamma .
stay weird , brooks .
with me , ross .
god , there &apos;s more ?
never saw it coming , right ?
what &apos;s that , the storm ?
no . april .
i was sure someone would let it slip .
and have you , uh , seen dr. hunt ?
no , no . what &apos;s up ?
nothing . i--i &apos;d ...
would you tell him thanks , though ?
i had him keep april out of surgeries all day .
this was kind of my only shot at this .
didn &apos;t wanna miss it .
no , no , you didn &apos;t .
congratulations , both of you guys .
thanks .
贝利 罗斯
still awake ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
owen &apos;s , uh , transferring paul dawson and his kid
over to seattle pres .
how &apos;s owen ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , i woke the guy up .
that &apos;s all he &apos;s been wanting to do ,
but now he just seems more disappointed with me ,
and i know he &apos;s got close to the kid .
you know , owen was talking
about taking the kid himself .
taking him ?
what , like a @-@ adopting him ?
or fostering .
he asked me about it . he seemed ready to do it .
okay , what am i supposed to do with that ?
like , what am i supposed to do ?
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything you can do .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s about you .
thank you .
you guys have backup generators , right ?
yeah , of course we do .
this really has been a lot of fun .
sort of sorry--
me , too . i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s over .
all right , well ,
then you &apos;ll just have to have me back at some point .
that would be really great .
well ...
okay .
it was ... okay .
oh , god ! i can &apos;t .
what ?
i can &apos;t .
we do our very best .
it was a pleasure meeting you .
arizona .
you are allowed to lose a little bit of control .
but sometimes it &apos;s just not good enough .
we buckle our seat belts . we wear a helmet .
we stick to the lighted paths .
what the hell happened ?
the power went out a half @-@ hour--
no , you . what were you thinking ?
peckwell could have died .
is he--
no , he &apos;s fine , and you &apos;re lucky he &apos;s not pressing charges ,
but you are an idiot .
you get that you could have gone to jail , right ?
you say that you worked so hard to change ,
to become this new person ,
but then you do this ?
if you don &apos;t wanna be a lowlife anymore ,
you gotta grow up and stop acting like one .
no , you grow up !
not everyone &apos;s like you , al .
people are horrible .
and the last time someone grabbed me like jason did , i ...
i promised no one would ever do that again .
so i am sorry , but ...
not everyone &apos;s like you . not everyone &apos;s good .
we try to be safe .
and now you think i &apos;m horrible , too .
no .
no . if you hadn &apos;t gotten to him first ,
i probably would have killed the guy .
why ?
why would you do that for me ?
shut up . why wouldn &apos;t i ?
we try so hard to protect ourselves ,
but it doesn &apos;t make a damn bit of difference .
&apos;cause when the bad things come ,
they come out of nowhere .
the storm is here .
it &apos;s totally here .
the , uh , day care center
said they &apos;re gonna be open for 24 hours ,
so i &apos;m keeping sofia in there .
we &apos;re not leaving . are you guys leaving ?
i don &apos;t know .
where the hell is arizona ?
we &apos;re gonna stay , right ?
yes , we &apos;re gonna stay .
&apos;cause if we get trapped at the house ,
and you go into labor ...
no , we &apos;re staying because they need surgeons .
you need to take it easy .
i &apos;m just gonna work until i--
the bad things come suddenly with no warning .
what ? meredith , what is it ?
but we forget ...
you okay ?
yeah .
that sometimes ...
yeah . my water just broke .
what ? okay .
okay .
okay .
that &apos;s how the good things come , too .
okay .
what are you thinking ?
a bunch of people got hurt here .
i didn &apos;t see the point in any more .
i mean , the guy &apos;s not pressing charges .
oh , so it all works out .
you feel good about that ?
because you shouldn &apos;t .
