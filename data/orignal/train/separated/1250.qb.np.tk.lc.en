you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
again with the lies
i &apos;m sorry .
that was a joke .
i don &apos;t need to know what we are tonight .
i just need to be with you .
your being here is not part of the plan .
and neither is what you &apos;re doing to that girl .
i know you killed charlotte .
there is something that i have to take care of .
it &apos;s a favor for a friend .
would her name be spencer ?
help ! please stop !
if someone tried to hurt you , the police--
i have to talk to my friends before i do anything .
look , in that room before all the lights went off
and someone pushed me down a hole , i was scared .
me too .
maybe that &apos;s why what happened
happened with us .
help me , emily .
ali ?
i am so sorry .
oh , my god .
what ?
your back .
oh , um , it &apos;s nothing . it &apos;s fine .
that &apos;s definitely not nothing , hanna . those ..
god , those look like burn marks .
did that happen to you in there ?
spencer &apos;s here .
hanna ..
i told you not to ask mary for help .
okay , well , if i &apos;d listened to you
i wouldn &apos;t have seen mary and elliott together .
so you saw them arguing . what &apos;s so suspicious about that ?
no , it was the way that they argued .
like they were familiar with each other .
this definitely wasn &apos;t the first time they met .
then why would they want us to believe that they did ?
i mean , we know mary &apos;s working with a man .
maybe it &apos;s him .
no . no . elliott would never hurt alison .
he loves her .
does he ?
because since she &apos;s been in his care , she &apos;s only gotten worse .
look , i understand why mary wants
to avenge charlotte &apos;s death , but why would he ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , ali called me begging for help .
she &apos;s clearly scared of someone in there .
well , it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s elliott .
i mean , mary could be working with somebody else .
okay , if that &apos;s true , why didn &apos;t she call him for help
instead of me ?
all of this happened right after mary got a hold of ali &apos;s jacket .
yeah , and then we suddenly weren &apos;t allowed to visit anymore .
maybe that &apos;s because he doesn &apos;t want us
to see what he &apos;s doing to her .
yeah , well , i did , and it &apos;s awful .
he had her strapped down to a bed like an animal .
if it is elliott
he &apos;s capable of doing a lot more than that .
yeah , we need to get her away from him .
how ? she &apos;s his patient and his wife .
we go to welby .
we talk to someone in charge
and we tell them what &apos;s going on .
okay , you guys do that . i &apos;m gonna go talk to toby
and maybe he find a connection between mary and elliott .
what is it ?
i just keep thinking about the night
that alison and elliott came to my house
when they asked me to marry them .
they seemed so in love .
第七季第三集
that was your mom .
she offered me a bartending job at the radley .
that &apos;s great .
yeah . but she wants me to start today .
and with everything going on , i don &apos;t know if i should take it .
em , you need to pay for hollis . we understand .
i &apos;m sure ali will too .
are you gonna tell ezra about elliott ?
no , he &apos;s not here .
he &apos;s out of town working on notes for the book .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hanna .
you okay ?
please don &apos;t ask me that .
look , i don &apos;t wanna push--
and i appreciate that .
we were all in the dollhouse .
i know what you &apos;re going through .
it &apos;s not the same .
um , can you just order me a latte ?
i &apos;ll be outside .
yeah .
so i just wanted to say thank you for the other night .
yeah . you looked like you needed a friend .
and i want to repay you .
so maybe we could grab dinner some time .
that &apos;s not necessary . i would &apos;ve done it for anyone .
hm . it &apos;s not just to say thank you .
i @-@ i mean , no pressure .
if you &apos;re not interested , that &apos;s--
no , no , it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s just ..
then what ?
ezra &apos;s key
that whole mess
just kinda left a bad taste in my mouth , you know ?
i still feel terrible about that .
me too .
what was that about ?
apparently nothing .
yvonne ? hi .
spencer .
toby &apos;s not here .
he &apos;s working on the house .
oh ! okay , um , i &apos;ll just go find him . thanks .
do you have , uh , another favor to ask ?
look , i @-@ i really don &apos;t wanna cause any problems between you two .
you already have .
i know ... and i &apos;m sorry .
i wouldn &apos;t mind him helping you if i knew what he was doing .
last time he wouldn &apos;t tell me anything .
that &apos;s because i asked him not to .
it &apos;s just , um .. i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s private .
well , i can &apos;t have him disappearing again .
not tonight . we have family coming over to celebrate .
oh , my god .
congratulations . i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t know .
thanks . we &apos;re really excited .
you know what , it &apos;s .. this is totally not important .
i don &apos;t need to talk to toby right now .
yeah ?
yeah .
okay .
bye .
but , dr. freedman--
i wasn &apos;t aware dr. rollins was treating alison
but i assure you she &apos;s in excellent hands .
she &apos;s deteriorating every day , physically and mentally .
sometimes , patients get worse before they get better .
medications often need to be adjusted until we get it right .
i &apos;ll make sure dr. rollins keeps you apprised of her progress .
we think he &apos;s abusing alison .
and if you don &apos;t go check on her right now
we will file a complaint against dr. rollins ... and you .
against me ? on what grounds ?
for having knowledge about the situation
and neglecting to do anything about it .
and that makes you liable .
ask dr. rollins to meet me in his wife &apos;s room .
dr. freedman .
elliott .
alison &apos;s friends expressed concern
about her condition .
well , she had a few bad days
but i &apos;m happy to report she &apos;s doing better .
she &apos;s being treated with a low dose of clozapine . that &apos;s good .
vital signs are stable and within normal limits .
i know it &apos;s hard but try not to worry .
dr. rollins is taking good care of alison .
hey , where have you been ?
uh , toby &apos;s .
he and yvonne ... got engaged .
really ?
yeah .
wow , that &apos;s great .
i &apos;m glad they were able to work through their issues .
yeah , me too .
you know , just knowing how happy they are
got me thinking about us .
&apos;cause i &apos;ve wanted this , caleb , for a really long time .
so have i.
and it &apos;s been great , but ...
... you know , everything changed once hanna disappeared .
well , i promised to keep her safe .
so i felt responsible .
yeah , but she &apos;s back now , and you still seem distant .
so i keep on asking myself why .
you two were alone together that night .
did something happen ?
sh @-@ she was scared .
i @-@ i was comforting her .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m asking .
we kissed .
old memories got stirred up .
it was like we were in a time warp back in high school .
yeah , bu @-@ but we &apos;re not in high school , you know ?
an @-@ and hanna &apos;s not your girlfriend . i am .
i know .
i know .
look , i can handle a kiss .
but is that all it was ?
or do you still have feelings for her ?
hello ?
jason had no idea that alison was at welby .
elliott never called him .
so elliott lied .
he must &apos;ve known we were at the hospital
and sedated alison so she couldn &apos;t talk .
has toby looked into elliott and mary ?
uh , no . i didn &apos;t , i didn &apos;t ask him to .
why not ?
because he just got engaged .
look , i don &apos;t think that we should be
involving him in this anymore .
okay , that &apos;s not your call to make , spencer .
toby &apos;s the only person that can help us .
i mean , ali &apos;s life is in danger , and it &apos;s our fault .
no ! no , it is her fault .
she &apos;s the one who killed charlotte .
i mean , do we all realize that the only reason
we &apos;re stuck in this small town
is because of charlotte &apos;s death ?
that we &apos;ve been on a hamster wheel
risking our lives day after day , trying to figure out who it was
when all along it was her !
alright , we don &apos;t know that for sure .
whether or not she did it ..
... she doesn &apos;t deserve to be tortured .
when does jason get back ?
he can get ali out of welby .
he &apos;s out of the country .
i don &apos;t know . he can &apos;t come back for a few days .
well , that &apos;s too long .
we have to get her out now .
how ?
you said you saw him open a locked trunk in his bedroom .
right ?
yeah .
well , maybe there &apos;s something in there
that he doesn &apos;t want anybody to see .
maybe whatever it is can help us figure out what he &apos;s doing .
i still have a key to ali &apos;s house .
great .
jason didn &apos;t even know that they got married .
he freaked out .
where the hell is jason ?
ethiopia .
what &apos;s he doing there ?
charity work .
here .
i have to get to work .
okay , we &apos;ll let you know what we find .
so where &apos;s , uh , where &apos;s jordan ?
i thought he was gonna be coming back with you .
oh , no , he &apos;s swamped at work .
is everything okay with you guys ?
yeah . great . why ?
cause caleb told me
about what happened between you two at the lost woods .
spencer , i &apos;m so sorry .
you really shouldn &apos;t have told me
that you were over him if you weren &apos;t .
well , i am over him , okay ?
that was a huge mistake .
was it ?
yes .
look , i meant what i said .
caleb is my past and jordan is my future .
elliott &apos;s coming .
艾略特来了
your friends made quite a spectacle of themselves today .
oh , i just think it &apos;s so amazing
how much better alison &apos;s gotten overnight .
i &apos;m doing all i can for her .
are you ?
cause ali called us and she &apos;s convinced
that someone at welby &apos;s is trying to hurt her .
part of her illness is paranoia .
she thinks everyone &apos;s out to harm her .
it &apos;s not paranoia if it &apos;s real .
i want you guys to stop visiting alison .
you &apos;re disturbing her .
and what about what she wants ?
if you keep pushing
i promise it &apos;ll be detrimental to her health .
god , what &apos;s taking her so long ?
i don &apos;t know .
i never should &apos;ve agreed to marry them .
ali never should &apos;ve agreed to marry him .
i mean , they only dated for one week .
we know nothing about him .
yeah , well , apparently , neither did she .
hey , go to those photos i took .
wait .
that &apos;s elliott &apos;s credit card statement .
i saw it on his dresser .
there &apos;s a charge here for amish bed and breakfast .
that &apos;s the same week that ali went with elliott
to his family &apos;s farm .
why would they stay at a b &amp; b ?
i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s only an hour from here .
i say we drive up there .
why ?
it &apos;s a small community .
they might know elliott &apos;s family .
and what &apos;s that gonna do for us ?
maybe they can fill in some of the blanks about who he is .
maybe they know if he &apos;s connected to mary .
even if we find his family , i doubt they &apos;ll talk to us .
well , we have to try .
if elliott is working with mary , it &apos;s only a matter of time
before he does to ali what he did to you .
or worse , so ...
i &apos;m going .
anyone coming ?
i @-@ i should stay here , i &apos;m gonna try to figure out
what elliott &apos;s doing with these things .
okay . hanna ?
yeah . i &apos;ll drive .
great .
hey , you &apos;ve reached toby cavanaugh .
leave a message .
i can &apos;t believe we lost cell service .
i can &apos;t believe lucas owns a map .
you know what ? you were right .
we should &apos;ve turned on to route 30 .
hey , is liam still in town ?
no . no , he went back to boston .
we broke up .
wait , i thought everything was going great with you guys .
yeah , it was .
it &apos;s just , ezra and i , we spent a lot of time
with each other these last few weeks and ...
i just realized how much i missed having him in my life .
we &apos;re both lucky .
i &apos;ve got ezra , you &apos;ve got jordan .
yeah .
do you think you &apos;ll tell him what happened to you in there ?
i don &apos;t wanna involve him .
why ? he &apos;s your fiance .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;d wanna know .
hanna
aria , stop .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m just tryin &apos; to help .
well , you &apos;re not .
i wanna forget the hell that i went through not relive it .
and i don &apos;t wanna talk about it , not with you
not with jordan , not with anyone .
if i do , i &apos;ll never stop crying .
here &apos;s your whisky and soda .
emily .
how did you know what i ordered ?
does the outfit tip you off ?
you work here . i didn &apos;t know .
no , i &apos;m , i &apos;m training today
but yeah , i &apos;m gonna be a bartender .
well , thanks for the drink .
no problem .
i just wanna let you know
that the conversation we had the other day at the brew
that was real , it wasn &apos;t an act .
you don &apos;t have to explain anything .
we thought ezra was in trouble and we wanted to help him out .
i mean , that doesn &apos;t make what we did right
especially the lying part .
now &apos;s really not a good time .
i like you , sabrina .
and i think you feel something for me , too .
because if you didn &apos;t , i wouldn &apos;t be standing here
making a fool out of myself .
you know , i just wish that you wouldn &apos;t judge me
based on one stupid mistake because if you got to know me
you &apos;d realize that that &apos;s not who i am at all .
hey , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
traffic was terrible .
well , it &apos;s alright .
hey , uh , could i get a glass of chardonnay ?
yeah .
thanks .
yeah .
well , that was a waste of time .
how was i supposed to know
that they wouldn &apos;t give us any information ?
the day is almost over and we &apos;re no closer
to figuring out a way to help ali .
this is the second time today
i &apos;ve completely embarrassed myself .
where are you ?
hiding from sabrina and her model girlfriend .
i &apos;m , uh , taking a 15 minute break .
it &apos;s her loss , em .
did you make any sense of the things
aria found at elliott &apos;s ?
uh , well , i haven &apos;t looked up any of the medications yet
but this list of ingredients that he wrote down
is used to make latex .
wait . as in gloves ?
no , like in masks
like the one that we found on the hanna doll in the bell tower .
wait a minute . what color are elliott &apos;s eyes ? &apos;
um , i think brown . why ?
because he has these blue contacts in the trunk .
em , when alison checked herself into welby
she didn &apos;t think that she just saw her mother .
she felt that she saw wilden too .
i don &apos;t think that he just used the latex
to make a mask of hanna .
i think he used it to make one of wilden too .
he wanted alison to think she was crazy .
let &apos;s go look at the furniture .
why ?
because if he thinks we &apos;re gonna buy
he &apos;ll probably talk .
what &apos;s your name ?
i &apos;m not supposed to talk to the english .
sorry . i don &apos;t wanna get you in trouble .
you &apos;re pretty .
thanks . so are you .
who &apos;s your friend ?
i &apos;m eliza .
look , i don &apos;t know why elliott would lie about this
but his family doesn &apos;t own a farm .
there &apos;s nobody with the name rollins in the county .
well , i &apos;m starting to wonder if he &apos;s telling the truth
about anything .
are you okay ?
you look like my dolls .
what dolls ?
the ones charlotte gave me .
i found the lipstick , but charlotte gave me the dolls .
can we play with you ?
that &apos;s emily .
this is alison .
she &apos;s my favorite .
why ?
she looks like charlotte .
did elliott and charlotte come here a lot ?
they used to come all the time .
she loved playing dolly with me .
i saw them kissing once , but i &apos;m not supposed to tell .
i &apos;m gonna miss charlotte .
do you know when she &apos;s coming back ?
eliza ?
please don &apos;t say anything .
we &apos;re not allowed to have dolls with faces .
if he sees &apos; em , he &apos;ll take &apos; em away .
how much better did charlotte really get
if she was still naming dolls after us ?
guessing not much .
i think it &apos;s best you go now .
can i order another drink ?
yeah . um , whisky and soda ?
please .
i @-@ i can bring it to your table .
i don &apos;t mind waiting .
look , emily , um , about what you said earlier--
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
you have a girlfriend . i get it .
she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
she &apos;s my ex . we &apos;re just friends .
i appreciate what you said .
actually , i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about it all during lunch .
really ?
i judged you too quickly .
that &apos;s not who i am .
why don &apos;t we start over ?
clean slate .
let &apos;s get dinner this week .
you &apos;re on .
you know , i didn &apos;t even want another drink .
i just wanted an excuse to talk to you .
i can &apos;t believe elliott and charlotte were a couple .
that must be why they came here .
no chance of running into anyone they knew .
well , if he was in love with her
that would explain why he &apos;s working with mary .
yeah , but why would he marry alison ?
i don &apos;t know .
seems like he &apos;s the one who should be locked up in welby .
hanna , what is it ?
please !
hanna ?
oh , no .
no , no , no !
please , stop !
that &apos;s what he used on me .
a cattle prod ? oh , my god !
hanna ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m fine .
ali &apos;s the one who needs help now .
no , he &apos;s not gonna get away with this .
elliott will pay for what he did to you . i promise .
you &apos;ve been in here a while .
yeah , i &apos;m , i &apos;m just trying to figure out
what these medications do .
i really think we need to talk
about what happened this morning .
we will . later .
come on , spence .
look , i get it , okay ?
you &apos;re confused .
no . no , i &apos;m not .
look .
there &apos;s a part of me that will always love hanna , okay ?
she was my first real love .
but it &apos;s you i wanna be with .
and if hanna wanted to be with you now ?
would that change things ?
no .
do you mean that or do you just feel obligated to say it ?
seriously ?
look , after that time we spent together in madrid
i couldn &apos;t stop thinking about you .
and then we met up again in dc
and the more time we spent together
the more i wanted to be with you .
i know . me too .
i like everything about you .
okay , you &apos;re smart , and you &apos;re driven .
you &apos;re sexy as hell .
yeah , but that &apos;s the problem .
you like me ..
... but i love you .
and i @-@ i wanna be with somebody
who thinks about me the first thing in the morning
and the last thing at night .
look , things just got really off track .
okay , just ..
please give me a chance to make it , to make it right .
i really want this to work .
i don &apos;t know that i can .
so please raise your glasses and toast ..
... to the future mrs. cavanaugh
before she changes her mind .
hey , um , i &apos;m gonna be right back , okay ?
okay .
look , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i didn &apos;t realize you were doing this tonight .
can we just talk tomorrow ?
no , ali &apos;s in trouble .
we think elliott &apos;s working with mary .
yeah , he , isn &apos;t he taking care of her at welby ?
yes , and that &apos;s the problem .
she killed charlotte , em .
probably .
but if we can prove that elliott &apos;s trying to hurt ali
we can expose ad .
look into him , please ?
see if you can find out anything .
okay ? and ..
maybe there &apos;s something in here
that can help you find a connection
between mary and elliott .
okay , i &apos;ll call you .
we don &apos;t have a lot of time .
things will fall into place
once you and caleb get back to dc .
yeah , i don &apos;t think any of us are getting back
to our normal lives until we expose mary and elliott .
well , it &apos;s gonna be hard to prove that he made that mask .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think
these medications have anything to do with ali &apos;s condition .
and dr. freedman said that she &apos;s only taking clozapine .
then why did he have them locked up with the other things ?
that &apos;s a good question .
well , looks like he only used this one .
and the vial &apos;s almost empty .
that &apos;s a stimulant .
so what do you take it for ?
to help you focus , to stay awake .
like speed ?
yeah .
yeah , if you use it enough .
&quot; high doses and frequent uses
&quot; can cause hallucinations
delusions and thought disorder . &quot;
dr. freedman said that she &apos;s only taking one drug .
that doesn &apos;t mean that elliott &apos;s not giving her another .
ali wasn &apos;t crazy when she went into welby
but he &apos;s making sure she is now .
change of plans , alison .
we have to go to the police .
what ? we &apos;ve no actual evidence .
she &apos;s right .
it &apos;s all just speculation at this point .
we have enough to get them to look into elliott .
and once they do , they &apos;ll figure out the rest .
and what about mary ?
we tell them everything we know about her too .
where are you going ?
to get the file .
the more information they have on her , the better .
it &apos;s gone .
where did you put it ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know , i had it with me
when i went to toby &apos;s this morning .
i took it .
i gave it to toby .
i asked you not to involve him .
ali &apos;s life trumps what you want , spencer .
okay , you know what ?
i &apos;m starting to think it &apos;s a bad idea to go to the cops .
why ?
because if we do we have to tell them
that mary and elliott are after alison
because she killed charlotte .
we &apos;d be implicating her in the murder .
uh , elliott just sent me a text .
it &apos;s a pin drop of his location .
how does he have your number ?
i gave it to him when i was looking after ali .
let me see .
okay , he &apos;s at welby .
the pin just started to move .
why does he want us to know where he &apos;s going ?
he must know that we &apos;re on to him . this must be a trap .
what does it say ?
&quot; sos . &quot;
guys , i don &apos;t think this is elliott sending the text .
i think alison is .
she wants us to know that he &apos;s taking her somewhere .
i thought you were saying bye to your aunt cathy and uncle joe .
uh , i did , but then , um , something came up with work .
i just need to look into it .
does this have anything to do with why emily was here ?
no , um , she just came by .
she wanted to let me know alison was doing okay .
that &apos;s good .
i &apos;m ready for bed . i was hoping you &apos;d join me .
i guess i gotta get used to being a police officer &apos;s wife .
i will be in as soon as i can .
违章行驶 宾夕法尼亚州斯克兰顿 1958
1958 ?
he &apos;s making a turn at old nichols road .
he &apos;s headed for the lake .
wait , there &apos;s a shortcut to get there .
take a right up here .
okay .
oh , i lost signal .
we &apos;re gonna lose them .
no , just keep driving in this direction .
okay , i got bars back .
elliott &apos;s car stopped moving .
yeah , but they &apos;re only half a mile ahead of us .
watch out .
oh , my god .
he ... he &apos;s dead .
