i &apos;m getting married , and i don &apos;t wanna screw it up ,
enough of those screwups , and you just end up alone .
gaby discovered that old flames ...
yeah , that can happen .
can leave embers .
do you at least know why he steals ?
i steal to hurt you .
bree &apos;s tortured marriage ...
i &apos;m not your wife anymore , orson . i &apos;m your captive .
don &apos;t you feel any remorse at all over that ?
guilt is a small price to pay for happiness .
led her into an affair with karl .
what happened to the good girl ?
she decided guilt &apos;s a small price to pay for happiness .
lynette revealed a closely guarded secret .
no one else can know about this .
i &apos;m pregnant .
you are ?
something &apos;s happened to julie .
and when a crime was committed ...
how does a fish get caught ?
he opens his mouth .
a suspect emerged .
there &apos;s a certain kind of woman
you see in the suburbs .
she waits for the school bus in her bathrobe .
she stops by the post office with curlers in her hair .
she goes to the market in sweatpants and a t @-@ shirt .
this woman is a housewife ,
and she doesn &apos;t bother trying to be beautiful
because ...
it &apos;s a waste of time .
i was trying to hit celia .
well , get better aim !
ana , help me clean this mess .
don &apos;t up your volume on me .
juanita , finish those vegetables .
don &apos;t make me count to three .
oh , don &apos;t give me that look , you sawed off little--
gaby ?
oh , my god .
john . hi .
wow . what a surprise .
i was so busy back in the kitchen
i didn &apos;t even know you guys were here .
how are you ?
well , i &apos;m usually better
when i don &apos;t have creamed spinach all over me .
uh , so ... are you working here ?
hey , nothing wrong with waitin &apos; tables .
could you get us some more bread ?
maybe i could bring you some dessert on the house .
i &apos;ll just go ask the owner . oh , wait. that &apos;s me .
honestly ? you own this
i bought it with the money i got in my divorce settlement .
really ? you &apos;re divorced ?
yep . almost a year now .
oh , my god . are--are these your kids ?
yeah . this is celia and juanita , and this is our niece ana .
hello .
hi .
i can see the family resemblance .
she &apos;s my niece .
it must &apos;ve been a windy day when
the apple fell off that tree
well , it was--it was great seeing you again .
you , too .
still don &apos;t see any bread here .
i &apos;ll be right back .
yes ,
there &apos;s certain kind of woman you only meet in the suburbs
she will try to look beautiful
if she has someone to look beautiful for .
on this street ,
the day begins with a cup of coffee .
most need it to wake up .
some can &apos;t read their morning paper without it .
a few like to drink it on their way to work .
then there are those
who just want something to hold in their hands
while they discuss the neighbors .
well , danny had me fooled .
he seemed like a pretty nice kid .
yeah , except for the strangling .
sorry .
oh , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m just happy that julie &apos;s safe
and they caught the guy .
uh , susan .
bob .
go inside .
go inside .
hey , susan .
i &apos;m confused . the--the last i heard ,
the police had danny bolen in custody .
danny was never under arrested
the police were questioning him ,
but they had no grounds to hold him .
that sounds like his lawyer talking
are you his lawyer ?
susan , you know how much i love julie ,
but they have no evidence against this kid ,
and i couldn &apos;t just let him sit there .
if he
didn &apos;t do it , why would he need to fake his alibi
because he &apos;s a kid and he was scared .
angie , this is not a good idea .
i @-@ i just gotta say this . susan , please .
i can &apos;t even imagine what you &apos;ve been going through .
i am begging you , as my friend and neighbor ,
don &apos;t defend him .
susan , it &apos;s my job .
then i don &apos;t know how you sleep at night .
susan , wait .
come on . can--can we please just talk about this ?
we can go inside , just the two of us .
no .
you wanna talk about this ?
let &apos;s do it out here in the open . hey , everybody !
her son tried to kill my daughter .
and while he &apos;s here , nobody on this street is safe .
what is this ?
bacon and cheese burrito .
you couldn &apos;t find any croissants or pain au chocolat ?
sweetie , we &apos;re at a motor lodge on the interstate .
i was lucky to find a burrito .
people always talk about the moral hazards of cheating .
no one warns you about the food .
so you want me to book this place for tomorrow ?
mm , sorry ihave an event
oh , wait . you know , i think i do , too .
how &apos;s this then ? we &apos;ll go to vegas for the weekend ?
las vegas ?
why not ?
i &apos;ll lose my shirt in the casino ,
and then we &apos;ll head upstairs , and you can lose yours .
i can &apos;t disappear for a whole weekend .
my husband would notice .
say you &apos;re visiting family .
karl !
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t see us having romantic getaways .
that &apos;s the sort of thing
a woman does with a man she &apos;s in love with .
and we don &apos;t have those kinds of feelings . i get it .
but you are a delightful diversion .
and in order to keep things delightful ,
i think it &apos;s best
we not put unreasonable demands on each other .
okay . fine .
you could &apos;ve said , &quot; pass the sugar . &quot;
i didn &apos;t want to make a demand .
so ... i know you guys have been concerned
&apos;cause i &apos;ve been so sick in the mornings .
well , i wanted to let you know why .
i &apos;m pregnant with twins .
well , now that the celebration &apos;s over , any questions ?
yeah . aren &apos;t you gonna be , like , the world &apos;s oldest mom ?
no . there &apos;s a woman in mongolia who &apos;s got me beat .
any other questions ?
i have more of a statement .
you two are so irresponsible .
you should &apos;ve been using birth control .
you &apos;re in college .
do you know what the odds are now that you &apos;ll graduate ?
like , zero .
you--you have a new job , one that you &apos;ll have to quit
once the baby comes . so i hope you &apos;re both happy .
you &apos;ve just destroyed your futures
for a few minutes of pleasure .
not to mention , it &apos;s so gross you &apos;re still doing it .
penny , you &apos;re excited about this , right ?
yeah , getting two little babies to play with .
if they &apos;re boys , i &apos;m outta here .
you have to understand ,
even though they &apos;ve released danny ,
it doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not still a suspect .
so what do we do ?
well , the police are gonna start
digging into your background
so i need to know what they &apos;re gonna find .
you &apos;re from new york , right ?
yeah .
but instead of wasting your time poking around in the past ,
you just need to back up danny &apos;s story .
right , just check out the liquor stores ,
see if anyone was on
i &apos;ll . but police will talk to people in your own neighborhood
see if he &apos;s got any ruins with the law , with girls .
is there anything i need to know , danny ?
nope .
not a thing .
okay ... but i still need to establish character .
so i &apos;ll need to get in touch with some old teachers , friends
nope , you don &apos;t need to do all that .
look , what are we doing here ?
i can &apos;t defend a client i know nothing about .
why can &apos;t you answer just a few simple questions ?
you wanna know why ? because this family has secrets !
danny .
big dark secrets that we can &apos;t talk about ,
not even to our lawyer .
you know , who cares if it makes me look guilty
even if i &apos;m not
knock it off
this conversation was privileged , right ?
so i don &apos;t know if you heard ,
but this morning the police released danny . bolen .
i heard . you must be worried sick .
i am .
clearly , he &apos;s unstable . who knows what he might do next ?
so what are we gonna do about it ?
you ever hear about that old man on maple drive ?
people found out he used to be an accountant for the nazis ,
and they threw garbage all over his yard .
that &apos;s right . and he moved .
but then it was bought
by some ex @-@ hippie who painted the house pink ,
so it was a pyrrhic victory at best .
well , look , i &apos;m just bringing this up
because i don &apos;t want people on this street
thinking that they &apos;re safe when they &apos;re not .
susan .
hey , uh , could you give me a hand for a sec ?
honey , what are you doing ?
mona.clarke &apos;s got a big mouth . if you get her worked up ,
she will talk about danny to everybody in the neighborhood
so ?
so we don &apos;t want an angry mob
showing up at the bolen &apos;s house
especially if we aren &apos;t even sure
danny &apos;s the one that attacked julie .
he lied about his alibi .
why would he do that if he was innocent ?
that &apos;s a good point .
and how can i live with myself
if someone else &apos;s daughter gets attacked ,
and i have said nothing ?
okay . okay , i get it .
it &apos;s just , this whole thing would be a lot easier
if the police just had some proof .
well , maybe we should get them some .
john .
hey .
i wanted to talk to you about something .
i thought i should do it in person , out of respect .
your niece came to my restaurant .
she asked me for a hostessing job .
and i think she &apos;d be great . you know , but given our history ,
i wanted to make sure you were okay with it .
because i wouldn &apos;t do it if it &apos;d make you feel uncomfortable
i mean , that &apos;s the last thing i &apos;d want .
like i said , given our ... history .
yeah .
why don &apos;t you stop saying , &quot; given our history &quot;
and just say , &quot; i banged your wife &quot; ?
you know , it &apos;s not that i haven &apos;t forgiven you .
it &apos;s just that every time i see you ,
i wanna put my fist in your face .
now did you park in the building ? &apos; cause we validate .
you know what ? i think this was a bad idea .
besides , gaby probably wouldn &apos;t have liked it anyway .
what ?
come on . i mean , her niece working for me--
i think she would &apos;ve freaked out .
you know ... given our history .
john ? hold on a second .
ana working for john ? are you nuts ?
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s been saying she should get a job .
yeah , at the mall hocking soft pretzels ,
not working for ...
your ex @-@ lover ?
well , yeah . how can you not think it &apos;s awkward ?
because that was years ago. we &apos;re past all that , right ?
of course we &apos;re .
it &apos;s just the whole thing makes me uncomfortable .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m gonna have to say no .
i knew it . you &apos;re jealous .
jealous ? of who ?
your beautiful niece working for your ex @-@ lover .
what ? !
you still have the hots for him .
oh , don &apos;t deny it . i saw you .
&quot; really ? you &apos;re divorced ? &quot;
okay. first of all , you just reminded me why i hate mimes .
secondly , is that why you &apos;re letting ana work for john ?
you were testing me ?
yeah , and you failed .
carlos , you are way out of line .
deny it all you want , but i know what i saw .
you wanted to look pretty for your ex @-@ lover .
well ... you know , he was also my ex @-@ gardener .
can &apos;t you call him that ?
it &apos;s so long since i &apos;ve seen you two together .
i was starting to wonder if you &apos;d split up .
oh ! no , we &apos;re still married .
no , just try getting away from this one !
arm .
bree , i know you &apos;re unhappy ,
but we haven &apos;t been out in months .
could you at least make an effort for one night ?
you are absolutely right .
why don &apos;t you get me one of those crab puffs ,
and then we &apos;ll mingle ?
sweetheart , this is just what i &apos;m--
crab puff .
karl !
bree ?
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean ?
are you following me ?
no . i &apos;m a member of the club .
i @-@ i had no idea that this was
the event that you were talking about .
oh , so you expect me to believe
that you showed up at a dinner dance alone ?
no , actually i ... i ...
karl , i know you have feelings for me ,
but i would hate to see them turn into some kind of ...
obsession .
hey , hon . find our table ?
a @-@ and you were saying ?
so , karl , aren &apos;t you going to introduce me ?
this is candace . she &apos;s an old friend .
oh , don &apos;t you mean that you &apos;re her old friend ?
candace , why don &apos;t we go find our table , huh ?
bree , if we don &apos;t run into you again ... good .
he doesn &apos;t mean to be brusque .
he &apos;s just a little eager to rush through dinner ...
so we can get to the motor lodge .
motor lodge ?
he wanted to go earlier , but i said no .
lobster first ,
then &quot; dessert . &quot;
candace , why don &apos;t we start
putting that lobster in your mouth right now ?
good @-@ bye , bree .
candace ?
dr. hodge !
oh , jeez .
you two know each other ?
yes , candace was a denta patient of mine .
i still think of you every time i put in my night guard .
listen , there &apos;s room at our table .
would you care to join us ?
no ! i mean ,
we &apos;re going to be leave soon .
you know , that motor lodge can wait .
that way , orson and candace can catch up ,
and you and i can have a little talk , too .
sure . that sounds like fun .
karl and i will just go get a couple apple martinis ,
and we &apos;ll come right back .
lovely girl , isn &apos;t she ?
she had a secret though .
her two front teeth ?
veneers .
i &apos;m guessing those aren &apos;t
her only side by side enhancements .
she &apos;s actually very sweet .
shame to see her mixed up with a dog like karl .
you have to pity any woman who makes that mistake .
yes , you do .
susan ?
oh ! shh ! shh !
get in ! get in ! get in ! get in !
what are you doing ?
stay low !
oh ! okay , let &apos;s try that again . what are you doing ?
surveillance .
i am gonna nail that danny bbolen kid .
i @-@ i thought the police were--
the police are useless .
so i &apos;m keeping a log of all his comings and goings .
if he leaves , and another girl gets attacked ,
he won &apos;t be able to lie and say he was home .
well ... i got a few minutes to kill .
oh , by the way , i was gonna call you .
you haven &apos;t told gaby i &apos;m pregnant , have you ?
no. why ?
well , i haven &apos;t had a chance to tell carlos yet ,
and i really think he should hear it from me-- get down !
you think i &apos;m nuts , don &apos;t you ?
no .
i think you &apos;re a mother .
thank you .
although speaking as a fellow mother ...
do you remember what happened to porter ?
everyone in town was so sure
he set that fire and killed those people .
people can be sure , and they can be wrong .
i &apos;m not wrong .
okay .
what are you doing ?
following him . buckle up .
no , i can &apos;t ! i have to put a meatloaf in the oven ! oh !
wait ! wait ! i forgot my--
so , candace , what do you do for a living ?
i &apos;m a dancer .
oh , what kind ? jazz ? ballet ? lap ?
actually , candace was a rockette .
oh ! it must &apos;ve been exhausting
spending so much time with your legs in the air .
i ... love this song .
bree ... would you care to dance ?
sorry , my shoes are killing me .
ask candace . she &apos;s the pro .
i &apos;d love to .
have fun , you two !
you loathsome pig .
you &apos;re supposed to be cheating with me , not on me .
i asked if you were free .
you weren &apos;t . i called candace .
what &apos;s the problem ?
well , it &apos;s just that she &apos;s so ... cheap .
she &apos;s beneath you .
not yet , but she will be .
bravo !
well done !
if her dress were any lower , it &apos;d be a belt .
gosh , bree , could this be jealousy i &apos;m hearing ?
i &apos;m not jealous . i &apos;m appalled .
and as long as
i will not have you running around with other women .
but we &apos;re not together .
i &apos;m just a diversion , remember ?
a little fling to spice up an afternoon .
and if that &apos;s all i am to you , fine .
but you don &apos;t get to say
what i can do when the afternoon &apos;s over .
are you gonna take her to our motor lodge tonight ?
just try and stop me .
excuse me .
someone over at the table was looking for you .
what the hell happened here ?
uh , orson tripped .
really , sweetheart . you need to be more careful .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry. the floor was slippery .
are you all right ?
i think i broke my nose .
i should go to the emergency room .
oh , dear. and you had such lovely plans for the evening .
hey , janice. is carlos done with his meeting yet ?
i really need to talk to him .
got a sec ?
never mind .
something wrong ?
how would you like
a parking space closer to the entrance ?
i &apos;d love it . you closed the door for that ?
no , i close the door
to ask if you would like to be my new senior v.p.
seriously ?
oh ... god .
carlos , i am ... so flattered .
and i would love to say yes . it &apos;s just--
i know . more responsibility , more hours away from home .
but you get a company car and an expensive account .
which is very generous , but i still can &apos;t accept because ...
and a 50 % salary bump .
because it doesn &apos;t have a 50 % salary bump .
but now that it does , i &apos;m in .
when do i start ?
tonight .
we &apos;re having dinner with a big potential client .
he is bringing his wife , so please bring tom .
sure .
wait .
weren &apos;t you gonna give this promotion to judy ?
i was .
but between you and me ,
i found out she &apos;s pregnant .
overheard her on the phone .
i saw what was coming--
doctor &apos;s visits , sick days , maternity leave .
yeah , that can be annoying .
but isn &apos;t denying a woman a promotion
because she &apos;s pregnant a tiny bit illegal ?
only if she finds out .
and , i mean , who &apos;s gonna tell her--my new senior v.p. ?
hell , no .
she &apos;s too busy thinking about
that big bump she &apos;s got coming .
yes ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about last night ,
and you , karl , candy ...
and it finally hit me what was really going on .
what are you talking about ?
the oil on the dance floor--
that was no accident. you put it there .
you wanted candy to fall .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
admit it .
you were jealous of that girl
from the moment karl walked in with her .
orson , you &apos;re not making any senses
why would i be jealous of karl &apos;s date ?
because she was dancing with me , of course .
i @-@ i suppose i should be mad at you
for nearly breaking my neck , but i &apos;m too relieved .
relieved ?
yes , if watching me dance with a pretty girl
can make you that crazy ,
then you obviously still care for me .
there &apos;s still hope for us .
orson , you &apos;re reading way too much into one impulsive act .
ohh , argue all you like .
a woman doesn &apos;t pull a stunt like that
over a man she &apos;s not in love with .
karl ? hi , it &apos;s bree .
um , i am thinking ...
maybe i &apos;m ready for that weekend in las vegas .
hi , mrs. bolen .
i &apos;m a friend of danny &apos;s from school . is he in ?
you got a name ?
sorry . eddie .
danny ! there &apos;s an eddie here .
it &apos;s a nice house .
you know what happened here , right ?
huh ? oh , yeah .
what are you gonna do ?
hey. what &apos;s up ?
hey. my brakes are shot .
is there any chance you could take a look at &apos; em ?
nah . i @-@ i don &apos;t feel like it , eddie .
come on . you &apos;ve been moping around the house all day .
go . help your buddy .
okay .
i &apos;m glad one of us has a friend .
i was the supermarket earlier .
everybody was looking at me
like i had their grandmother in my trunk .
yeah . while you were out , three hate calls in one hour .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m startin &apos; to think
it &apos;s time to get out of the bolen business .
no .
we cannot change our names and run
every time there &apos;s a little trouble .
this is more than a little trouble , babe .
i don &apos;t care .
we are not putting danny through all that again .
and maybe this hasn &apos;t worked out the way we &apos;d hoped .
but until i say otherwise , we are nick and angie bolen .
hey , can you go into the--the basement
and get me a work light ?
yeah .
thanks .
got a second ?
sure .
i &apos;m really sorry about what happened to julie .
thanks . actually , that &apos;s what i wanted to talk to you about .
i didn &apos;t hurt her , mrs. delfino .
but you did fight with her .
i mean , mrs. mccluskey saw you .
what were you fighting with her about ?
i &apos;m sorry. that lawyer told me
that i shouldn &apos;t talk to anybody about this stuff .
i know that julie thought she was pregnant .
what ?
you didn &apos;t think i knew that , right ?
is that what you ... fought about ?
um , i didn &apos;t even know that .
is that why you attacked my daughter ?
no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t
you &apos;re lying .
no , i &apos;m not .
you &apos;re lying !
please , just leave me alone .
hey ! what are you doing ?
i know that you did it .
i can see it in your eyes !
mom ! dad ! help me !
just admit that you did it !
admit it ! admit it to me !
mrs. delfino , please .
hey ! get the hell away from him !
oh , are you gonna attack me ?
hey !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
he did it ! you know that .
ma ! careful !
you come near here again , i swear i will kill you .
you can &apos;t protect him forever .
people know what he is now ,
and he &apos;s gonna be punished .
come on .
hey !
what the hell happened to my car ?
hi , uncle carlos .
your clients are here. i put him at
our best table. thank you , sweet .
lynette ? yeah ?
are you sure about this ?
about being senior v.p. with a 50 % salary bump ?
but did you hear the way
he described the job in the car
i mean , it sounds like a killer schedule .
i can handle it. and you get to stay in school .
remember your big dream ? our future ?
of course. but how are we gonna keep it a secret ?
carlos is gonna find out about this thing eventually .
by ... then , i will have proved i can do the job ,
pregnant or not .
please ?
okay. i &apos;m in .
but you gotta prove it fast .
remember last time you were pregnant with twins ?
every part of you swelled up .
it was like sleeping next to a body
they dragged out of the river .
you said i was beautiful .
i had to. you were twice my size .
this is a 2004 barolo
from my vineyard in piedmont .
your vineyard ?
yeah. that &apos;s why i insisted on this restaurant .
ey , uh , carry my lable
i love business , but wine is my passion .
oh , none for me tonight .
why not ?
well ... i wanna keep my head clear for business .
no. no business talk .
tonight is about getting to know each other
over good food and fine wine .
yeah , lynette , his wine .
so ... drink up .
well , i guess a little wouldn &apos;t hurt .
there .
yeah. very nice .
so ...
vic ...
what do you suggest to go with your wine ?
let me see .
the carpaccio sounds like a nice starter .
lynette. you liked it , huh ?
it was delicious .
lucky for you , it &apos;s a big vineyard .
thank you .
oh , look ! one of the pointer sisters !
sorry .
it was , um , just a nun .
excuse me. i &apos;ll be right back .
gaby , what the hell ?
i know. i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
i mean your clothes .
didn &apos;t i see that shirt in the hamper this morning ?
i gave it a sniff. it has another day in it .
gaby , this is an important business dinner .
yeah , but it &apos;s also john rowland &apos;s restaurant .
if i made myself pretty ,
you might think i was doing it just for him .
oh , god help me. is that what this is about ?
well , i didn &apos;t run the risk
of failing another test. okay , gaby ,
go change. you made your point .
not quite .
for the past 11 years , i have stood beside you
when you were poor and blind and knocked me up twice .
at this point in our marriage ,
if you still feel the need to test me ,
then you &apos;re the one who &apos;s failed .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you. and for the record ,
i only took my clip off and shook out my hair
because i ran into somebody i knew .
i would &apos;ve done it if it was lynette scavo , okay ?
okay .
so do you think you can go home and ...
oh , don &apos;t worry. i have clothes and makeup in the car .
good , because that shirt did not have another day in it .
hello ?
who is this ?
what is your name ?
oh , you got a big mouth for a guy with no name .
no ... you listen to me .
you come anywhere near my family ,
i will personally bash your brains in-
assuming you have any !
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine. just another moron with some empty threats .
and what if they &apos;re not empty ?
do you know where your father and i keep the gun ?
no , look , you &apos;re old enough know this stuff .
just in case someone should try to come in here
and hurt you ...
i can take care of myself
well , just in case you can &apos;t take care of yourself ...
there is a loaded .38 smith &amp; wesson in a box
in the second drawer in my dresser .
you got that ?
what are you smiling at ?
it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s not your typical mother / son conversation .
you know i &apos;ve always felt bad
about the way we &apos;ve had to raise you ,
being on the run and all .
if it weren &apos;t for me ,
you coulda had a normal childhood .
ma , you don &apos;t ever have to apologize to me .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re not like other moms .
thanks , baby .
i just wanna be a good one .
remember ...
aim for the head , not the legs .
so patti comes downstairs ,
and sitting under the christmas tree
is the cutest golden retriever puppy you ever saw .
oh , it was the best present i ever got .
do you like dogs , lynette ?
ooh , i love &apos; em !
but penny is allergic ,
so we got fish .
fish suck .
swim , die , flush--new one .
swim , die , flush--new one .
you know , what dog i &apos;d really like is the reima @-@ waner .
weimaraner .
a window @-@ hammer .
weimaraner .
rammerjammer .
lynette , make him stop .
gaby , you know , i ... i wanna tell you something ,
but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s gonna come out wrong .
your boobs look great in that dress .
well , tom , how could that possibly come out wrong ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
well , you &apos;ll have to excuse tom .
he &apos;s a bit of light weight
and your wine is so delicious , he couldn &apos;t resist .
but look at you . you had at least a bottle ,
and you &apos;d never know .
might as well finish this all
no no no
if she has one more glass , i &apos;m gonna puke .
i just talked to bob .
why would you do that ?
he asked me to stop by ...
because he wanted to tell me that the police
have evidence that clears danny bolen .
what ?
they &apos;ve got a shot
from a security camera at fairview liquors
that puts him there at the time julie was attacked
how would they know that
there was a time stamp .
they don &apos;t know the exact time the attack .
the camera shows him sitting in the parking lot
drinking beer for over an hour .
he couldn &apos;t have done it .
i can &apos;t believe this .
that means that julie &apos;s attacker is still out there .
and i &apos;ve been going up and down the street
telling erybody that danny bolen did it .
your daughter was hurt . you wanted somebody to blame .
people get that .
oh , god . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m so sorry .
well , i &apos;m sure the bolens will understand .
no , not just to them .
to you .
what are you talking about ?
well , you woke up the morning after your wedding
and found yourself married to a madwoman .
i have been ...
just totally obsessed with finding julie &apos;s attacker , and ...
i said , &quot; for better or worse . &quot;
so we start with the worse .
wow , glad this night &apos;s over . i &apos;m exhausted .
yeah , me , too .
you coming to bed ?
i &apos;ll be up in a sec . i &apos;m gonna turn off some lights .
on this street , the day begins with a cup of coffee .
some drink it while recalling a lover they once cared for .
some pour it ,
thinking of the boss they must lie to .
others sip it ,
contemplating a man they might be in love with .
but for one woman , on this particular morning ,
that cup of coffee has to wait ...
because she discovers a neighbor in trouble .
she goes to help ,
not only because it &apos;s the right thing to do ,
but because it &apos;s the only way she can think of ...
to ask for forgiveness .
and once it is given ...
