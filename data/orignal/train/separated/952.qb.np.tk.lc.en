the last two years are a blank .
that &apos;s a fresh approach .
i believe you .
&lt; i &gt; mike couldn &apos;t place a familiar face . &lt; / i &gt;
whoever killed her ...
&lt; i &gt; the police couldn &apos;t identify a murder victim . &lt; / i &gt;
... pulled out all her teeth .
there &apos;s no signature .
&lt; i &gt; gabrielle was getting showered with gifts ... &lt; / i &gt;
the buyer asked to remain anonymous .
&lt; i &gt; ... from a mystery suitor . &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m gonna open up a pizza parlor !
&lt; i &gt; and lynette couldn &apos;t believe ... &lt; / i &gt;
oh , dear god .
&lt; i &gt; ... what her husband had done . &lt; / i &gt;
i want to do what you want to do .
&lt; i &gt; julie &apos;s first love was two @-@ timing her . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and orson &apos;s first wife ... &lt; i &gt;
i &apos;m alma hodge .
&lt; i &gt; ... wasn &apos;t going away ... &lt; / i &gt;
what do you think ?
i &apos;ll take it .
&lt; i &gt; ... any time soon . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; your average housewife worries constantly about &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the dangerous people she sees on the nightly news . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; which is why she buys expensive alarm systems , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; carries pepper spray in her purse , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and keeps a gun in her drawer . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so she can go about her day feeling safe and protected . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; your average inmate worries constantly about &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the dangerous people he comes in contact with every day . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; which is why he takes ordinary items . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and turns them into weapons ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... that he always keeps handy . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so he can go about his day feeling safe and protected . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; what &apos;s the difference between housewives and inmates ? &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; the inmate knows the feeling won &apos;t last long . &lt; / i &gt;
delfino . right ?
yeah . so ?
come on , brother . let &apos;s go .
you ok ?
yeah .
i owe you one .
yeah .
i guess you do .
&lt; i &gt; yes . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we all need protection from those who would do us harm . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and sometimes from those who protect us . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; wild parties . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; handsome strangers . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; tender kisses . &lt; / i &gt;
i had a great time . bye , you guys .
&lt; i &gt; yes , there were many things gabrielle solis liked &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; about being single again . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; but coming home to an empty house ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... was not one of them . &lt; / i &gt;
you &apos;re sleeping at my place tonight .
really ?
what did you have in mind ?
god , i hate my life .
honestly , did you think i was going to sleep with you ?
it would be the polite way to thank me .
carlos , this isn &apos;t funny .
i am scared to death of this maniac .
since when ? yesterday you were loving all the presents .
the intrigue .
the guy broke into the house .
he went from secret admirer to stalker .
probably he &apos;s trying to kill me
so no one else will have me .
why don &apos;t you just call the cops ?
oh , and tell them what ? &quot; 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 ?
somebody broke in the house
and left a $ 6,000 dress . &quot;
ok , so , if this guy shows up again ,
what am i supposed to do , exactly ?
nothing . just having you here helps .
now , that &apos;s very sweet .
when he breaks in
and starts hacking you up with his machete ,
your screams will wake me and i &apos;ll be able to escape .
glad i could help .
stranger .
you have good timing .
i just got all the kids to sleep .
oh , damn . i wanted to tuck them in .
well , you can tuck me in .
i thought i smelled your sex perfume .
come here .
oh , oh , wait a minute . don &apos;t get me all revved up yet .
the printer is gonna drop off my menu on his way home .
he already did .
you didn &apos;t look at that , did you ? it &apos;s just a mock @-@ up .
too late . i looked . and it &apos;s great .
really ?
yes !
i love the font , the color , everything .
i am so jazzed to see the restaurant .
it is so good to hear that .
so ... any idea when that might be ?
sure . how about in two weeks ?
you open in two weeks .
that &apos;d be a good time to come by because there &apos;s free refills ,
balloons , music .
might there be a vip preview
for people , say , who bore your children ?
lynette .
yeah ?
i don &apos;t want you to see it until it &apos;s all done .
why not ?
you &apos;ll look at the place and have tips and suggestions
that you won &apos;t be able to keep to yourself .
you think ? because i just saw a takeout menu
with a six @-@ digit phone number and i kept that to myself .
see ! there it is .
that snarky , know @-@ it @-@ all attitude .
what ? i am snarky because i point out one small ,
glaring mistake ?
that &apos;s it . now you &apos;re banned from the opening .
fine . good night .
so , we &apos;re not having sex ?
hey , you banned me from your opening .
all i &apos;m saying is that i &apos;d feel a lot safer on the pill .
but if you &apos;re not 18 , you need parental consent .
do you really give your mother another reason to hate me ?
she &apos;ll hate you worse if you get me ... hey !
hi .
hi .
bye .
bye .
can &apos;t we keep using condoms and be extra careful ?
you crazy ? they &apos;re not dependable .
they are . why do you think everybody uses them ?
read the box . they all have to pass inspection .
it &apos;s too risky .
condoms are only 85 percent effective .
mom !
mom , what happened ? are you ok ?
i was just , uh ...
i lost an earring .
mom , you &apos;re wearing both your earrings .
i found it .
austin , i would like to talk to my daughter privately .
sure . call me later .
why were you talking about condoms ?
why were you eavesdropping ?
don &apos;t change the subject . are you two having sex ?
i thought that i raised you to be smarter than that .
don &apos;t you realize that sex is not fun and games .
it &apos;s dangerous !
every time there &apos;s a new disease !
do you want it to burn when you pee ?
mom .
sex kills !
mom !
what ?
i &apos;m not having sex .
really ?
really .
oh , thank god .
if you &apos;re not having sex .
why were you talking about condoms ?
because we know two kids at school who are ,
and they &apos;re only using condoms ,
which is stupid
because condoms are only 85 percent effective .
yes . that &apos;s right .
a condom alone will not protect you .
i totally agree .
bree !
alma .
i didn &apos;t know that you knew edie .
i told your friends at that party ,
i was looking for a new house .
a house ?
yes . and gabby introduced us .
oh . well , um , i don &apos;t want to keep you .
i &apos;m sure that edie has lots of other houses to show you .
nope , we &apos;re done .
alma took one look at the applewhite house , and bam ,
love at first sight .
what ?
we &apos;re going to be neighbors .
no !
i mean ... i mean , no .
alma , you can &apos;t buy this house .
why not ?
well , are you aware of its history ?
the previous owner was harboring a murderer .
it was her son .
say what you like , she was a great mom .
they had a dungeon in the basement .
people say they still hear groans
coming from the house at night .
they &apos;re gonna hear groans coming from your house
if you don &apos;t zip it .
don &apos;t worry , alma .
i &apos;m sure that edie can find you a house
that won &apos;t give you nightmares .
it &apos;s too late , bree .
i &apos;ve fallen in love with this neighborhood .
as for that haunted house stuff , that &apos;s silly .
people don &apos;t come back from the dead .
don &apos;t i wish .
i will not have that woman as a neighbor !
you have got to do something !
i said i &apos;d talk to her .
what are you waiting for ?
the house is dark . she &apos;s not there .
you &apos;re gonna wait until she moves in ?
i will deal with it . bree , please calm down .
how can i be calm ? for months
people thought you killed your first wife .
no sooner does she show up and clear your name
than the police ask you about another murder .
they just had questions .
everybody has questions .
susan and i don &apos;t speak because of it .
bree , please .
i try to hold my head up and smile
and just bake more pies for the church social .
but now your ex is camped out on our doorstep
like i am hosting some kind of mormon slumber party !
and i do not know
how i &apos;m going to bake my way out of this one .
darling , i swear to you , i will get alma out of that house .
i don &apos;t care if i have to
live up to my reputation and strangle her .
you &apos;re a good husband .
have you lost your mind ?
i am not getting you the pill .
aunt edie , julie and i are in love .
oh , please . it &apos;s not love you &apos;re feeling . it &apos;s hormones .
that &apos;s not true .
ok , fine .
if you want to express your love
you don &apos;t need to go all the way .
kiss . touch . rub .
i mean , whatever happened to heavy petting ?
it &apos;s so underrated .
that &apos;s your advice ?
well , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve never been good getting people not to have sex .
so you &apos;re not going to help us ?
julie , if i do this ,
your mother would have my head .
you should be talking to her .
i can &apos;t talk to her .
the whole idea of this completely freaks her out .
she started screaming , &quot; sex kills ! &quot;
so now it &apos;s all in my lap .
god , she pisses me off .
look , how about i spring for a box of condoms ?
will that get you two off my back ?
condoms are only 85 percent effective .
is that true ?
damn . i thought i could coast all the way to menopause .
look , we &apos;re going to have sex whether you help us or not .
we &apos;re just trying to be responsible .
all right .
but just so you know ,
the responsible thing is to abstain from sex
and focus on your studies .
there .
i said it out loud just in case anybody asks .
gaby , i need another pillow .
all right . don &apos;t take the big one . that &apos;s my favorite .
it &apos;s only for one night
because tomorrow i &apos;m going to be back home ,
sleeping in my own bed .
what ? you can &apos;t abandon me .
there &apos;s a madman stalking me . my life is on the line .
do you know how scared i am ?
you &apos;re keeping that ?
hey , i &apos;m scared , but not of the dress .
carlos !
carlos , wake up ! i need you !
yeah . i thought you &apos;d come around .
what ? no !
he &apos;s here !
carlos , be careful ! he might have a gun !
i &apos;m unarmed . stop kicking me !
now you &apos;re going to give me attitude ?
gaby , we got him . maintain .
this jerk terrorized me ! he broke into my house !
it was a $ 6,000 dress .
and my boss didn &apos;t want me leaving it on the porch .
your boss ?
hey , i &apos;m sorry to wake you , sir ,
but there was a problem dropping off the gift .
yes , and she &apos;s right here ... with me .
this is gabrielle . who the hell is this ?
yes , i got your &quot; token of esteem , &quot;
and i &apos;m not impressed .
because you &apos;re freaking me out , that &apos;s why !
no , i don &apos;t care how much it cost . that &apos;s beside the point .
really ? that much ?
tell him if he doesn &apos;t stop harassing you , you &apos;ll call the cops .
i know you &apos;re trying to be romantic , but if you keep this up ,
i &apos;m going to be forced ...
what did he say ?
that &apos;s very sweet of you ,
but i am not the most beautiful woman in the world .
tell him you &apos;re going to get a restraining order on him .
yes . i may be in the top ten .
gaby !
hey ! i &apos;m talking here !
your voice sounds so familiar . do i know you ?
he says i know him
and that he wants to reintroduce himself at dinner .
absolutely not .
i would not feel comfortable meeting for dinner .
good girl .
how about lunch ?
gaby !
but you have to promise
to stop buying me these expensive gifts .
because i &apos;m not that kind of girl .
well , for that many carats , yes , i could be that kind of girl .
i got to go . i &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow !
how about that ? and here i was thinking
some guy wants to murder me in my sleep .
the night &apos;s still young .
how &apos;re those ribs ?
just needed some tape . i mean , those guys were hard @-@ core .
you really saved my ass .
don &apos;t mention it .
no . seriously .
if there &apos;s ever anything i can do for you , just say the word .
i &apos;ll keep that in mind .
hey , delfino .
yeah , boss ?
i would have found yourself another prom date .
that guy &apos;s not your friend .
how do you know that ?
after those mutts knocked you around the other day ,
your boy paid them off .
you sure ?
i saw money change hands .
so watch your back .
i was in the middle of freaking out
when julie assured me that she &apos;s not having sex .
can &apos;t tell you how relieved i was .
uh @-@ huh .
don &apos;t say &quot; uh @-@ huh &quot; like that .
julie wouldn &apos;t lie to me .
if she says she &apos;s not having sex , then she &apos;s not having sex .
ok .
you can &apos;t say &quot; ok &quot; like that , either .
julie &apos;s not like other girls .
she &apos;s a straight @-@ a student .
and you were valedictorian .
what were you up to that your mother didn &apos;t know about ?
ok , you search the closet . i &apos;m going to look under the bed .
wait , wait , wait .
first rule of ransacking , remember where everything goes .
you are going to make a really good mother some day .
so , what does this diary look like ?
it &apos;s small . it &apos;s got a plaid cover .
when you find it you have to read it .
i promised her i would respect her privacy .
help me flip this mattress .
oh , my god !
you found it ?
this is adorable . you think maybe i could ... ?
no , you cannot borrow it .
fine .
why does julie have a vcr ?
to watch movies .
please . kids don &apos;t watch videos anymore .
everything &apos;s digital .
see ? it &apos;s just a tape .
is it ?
alma .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
measuring for drapes .
i &apos;m thinking damask .
you know what i mean .
why have you moved here ?
it &apos;s a very nice street .
and i &apos;ve made friends here .
people have taken such an interest in me .
yeah , they thought you were dead .
the novelty of your not being a corpse can &apos;t last forever .
what are you after , hm ?
are you still punishing me ?
you want me to pay you to leave ? what ?
i want what i &apos;ve always wanted .
you .
i &apos;m married .
and even if i weren &apos;t , i don &apos;t love you .
you didn &apos;t love the old alma .
i &apos;m not that woman anymore .
i &apos;m stronger , more confident .
it may take you a while to see that , but i can wait .
alma , i love bree .
but does she love you ?
she may love the orson she knows .
but does she know what you did to monique ?
does she know you ran over mike delfino ?
i know all that .
i still love you .
would she ?
so i see you &apos;ve spoken to mother .
yes .
it &apos;s nice to have someone on my side in all of this .
don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t tell bree .
she might go to the police
and you &apos;re no good to me in jail .
but if i thought i had no chance with you ,
no chance at all ,
well , there &apos;d be nothing to stop me from telling .
please , orson .
don &apos;t take away my hope .
she &apos;s not going .
why not ?
and what the hell was that on the porch ?
she kissed me good @-@ bye .
what was i supposed to do , slug her ?
you went over there to read her the riot act .
instead , it looked like you were reading her a bedtime story .
bree , i told her we don &apos;t want her here .
i threatened , i shouted .
she refuses to go .
we &apos;re just going to have to make the best of it .
hello ?
hey , it &apos;s me .
you want to meet for lunch ?
no , honey , i got to drive to greendale to pick out napkins .
remember , i told you .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s right .
so , i &apos;ll see you tonight .
ok . good . i &apos;ll see you .
oh , my god .
hey , mrs. scavo .
andrew , hi .
i thought you weren &apos;t starting until the opening .
oh , yeah , there &apos;s just so much work that needs to be done .
mr. scavo asked me to start early .
he &apos;s not here , by the way .
yeah , i know and , hey , don &apos;t tell him i stopped by .
i &apos;m not supposed to be here . i just wanted to sneak a peek .
shouldn &apos;t you be working ?
shouldn &apos;t you not be here ?
touch a !
so , how do you like the place ?
i think it &apos;s fantastic .
it &apos;s really coming together .
ooh , i love the bar .
oh , yeah . it &apos;s pretty cool .
it &apos;s too bad we can &apos;t get a liquor license .
what ?
oh , didn &apos;t mr. scavo tell you ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
don &apos;t restaurants make half their money on the liquor ?
oh . yeah . we &apos;re completely screwed .
this is a nightmare .
how did this happen ?
the city re @-@ zoned and said he had to
get all the residents within a block to sign a waiver
and there &apos;s some holdouts . he &apos;s kind of bumming .
well , then why isn &apos;t he dealing with it
instead of shopping for napkins ?
we could lose our shirts in this dump !
is this dr. marvin tashman ?
hi . my name is susan mayer .
my daughter julie came in to see you .
yes , about birth control .
so , i &apos;m just curious .
where do you get off prescribing that without my consent ?
what ? no , i most certainly was not there .
what do i look like ?
i don &apos;t have blonde hair .
wait . did my blonde hair have dark roots ?
i forgot to give you the keys to the shed .
you got my daughter the pill ?
here . catch .
don &apos;t you walk away from me !
do we have to do this now ?
yes . we do .
you might have gotten your first diaphragm with milk money .
it doesn &apos;t give you the right to corrupt my daughter !
it &apos;s not like i went to julie and said ,
&quot; want to go out for a burger and birth control ? &quot;
she came to me .
you do not get to decide this for her !
what were you thinking ?
i was thinking if julie got knocked up
that you and i could become family .
i &apos;m sorry . i cannot take that chance .
it was until your rotten nephew came to town
that julie was a perfect kid .
and now she &apos;s lying and scheming and having casual sex !
she &apos;s just a boob job away from being you !
look , mayer , julie has discovered sex .
the genie is out of the bottle .
you better get good with it or you could lose her forever .
because like it or not , she loves him .
and you know what else ? he loves her .
your gentleman friend went to make a call .
he &apos;ll be with you shortly .
thank you .
gabrielle .
zach young ! oh , my god ! it &apos;s been ages .
look at you ! so handsome in a suit .
you look beautiful .
aren &apos;t you sweet ?
well , anyway , i &apos;d love to catch up ,
but i &apos;m kind of waiting for someone .
yes , i know .
so the dress fits . cool .
i &apos;d like a bottle of your 1982
chateau laffite rothschild , please
i &apos;m sorry . how old are you ?
oh , why don &apos;t we say ... a hundred .
so you are .
wow , someone got an advance on their allowance .
i was my grandfather &apos;s sole heir .
i &apos;m actually in the fortune 400 .
does that seem weird to you ?
i &apos;m on a date with zach young .
nothing &apos;s ever going to seem weird again .
every cent we have is circling the bowl
and tom never said a word .
why didn &apos;t he come to me ?
clearly , he &apos;s embarrassed .
but i &apos;m his wife !
don &apos;t be dense , lynette .
half the reason men want to accomplish anything
is to show off for the women they love .
when they fail , they like to keep it to themselves .
i &apos;m gonna tell him
i &apos;m gonna tell him i went to the restaurant
and that i know he screwed up .
and that i &apos;m gonna fix it .
for god sake , it &apos;s bad enough you cut off his cojones .
now you want to juggle them ?
my husband is in trouble .
i love him . shouldn &apos;t i want to help him ?
well , if you really love him
you should help him without letting him know that you did .
yeah , so in addition to my penthouse ,
i also have a chateau in switzerland
and a cottage in the hamptons . it &apos;s pretty impressive , huh ?
you got a little chocolate on your shirt .
damn it !
here , let me get it .
no , i can do it ! i can do it !
i &apos;d like to do it myself . thank you very much .
i &apos;m sorry . you know , i &apos;ll be neater for you next time .
next time ? honey , let &apos;s get real .
you &apos;re way too young for me .
i &apos;m two months older than john rowland .
well , john rowland was a mistake . i was lonely .
you &apos;re not lonely now ?
you &apos;ve heard about my divorce ?
you were smart to get rid of carlos .
you deserve much better .
and let me guess . now you &apos;re my upgrade ?
everybody knows you need someone to take care of you
and i &apos;m rich now . i can give you anything you want .
wait a minute . who says i need someone to take care of me ?
my mom . her friends from the neighborhood .
they said it was the only reason you stayed with carlos ,
considering how he treated you .
well , they were wrong . thank you for lunch , zach .
wait , gabrielle .
i &apos;m not that awkward kid that i was before .
can you please just ... ? please take me seriously .
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t .
i &apos;m not gonna give up .
oh , sweetie . i really wish you would .
for god &apos;s sake , zach !
don &apos;t hijack a ferrari if you don &apos;t know how to drive .
mr. gaunt , hi , i &apos;m lynette scavo .
my husband is opening the pizzeria right down the block .
if it &apos;s about that liquor license , i &apos;m not signing .
please . i &apos;ve been at this for hours .
just hear me out .
well , i never could resist a pretty lady .
come on in .
thank you .
did you live in las vegas ?
i was a croupier for 40 years .
as you can see , i had a weakness for showgirls .
i bet you were quite the player .
you have no idea .
can i top you off there ?
no thanks . two &apos;s my limit .
well , suit yourself .
look , i understand your concerns about the license .
your neighbors had them , too .
but they signed the waiver once
i explained to them that this is a family restaurant .
no late nights , no loud music .
if there &apos;s one thing i learned in vegas ,
it &apos;s that booze turns most people into noisy jackasses .
and i don &apos;t want them puking on my doorstep .
come on , harry . you are my last holdout .
what &apos;s it going to take ? cash ?
free pizza for the rest of your life ? you name it .
look , i hate to disappoint a pretty lady , but i &apos;m not signing .
harry ,
my husband quit his job to start this restaurant .
and if we can &apos;t sell liquor ,
we can &apos;t make a profit and ...
whoa , whoa , whoa , harry .
eyes up here .
i &apos;m sorry . sorry .
this place is his dream .
and if he can &apos;t make it work , then it &apos;s just gonna kill him .
and consequently , it &apos;s gonna kill our marriage .
and harry , what did i say ?
i know . i don &apos;t mean to be rude .
it &apos;s just that my showgirl days were a while ago
and i can &apos;t remember the last time
i laid eyes on a ...
a beautiful woman &apos;s ... bosom .
really ?
well , what if i were to ...
... very briefly refresh your memory ?
completely worth it .
glad you thought so .
come on , baby . say it one more time for mommy .
you can teach him to say whatever you want ?
yes . these birds are very bright .
i think they &apos;re smarter than people .
some people , anyway .
bree !
come in . i just made some lemonade .
this isn &apos;t a social call .
we need to talk .
about what ?
about what it &apos;s going to take
to get you to sell this house and move .
move ? why ?
you &apos;re my husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
you disappeared so people would think he killed you .
does my discomfort really need further explanation ?
i had no idea you felt this way .
oh , please .
orson made it perfectly clear
we don &apos;t want you here .
ok , now i &apos;m really confused .
when orson came by ,
all he said was , &quot; welcome to the street , &quot;
and did i need help unpacking ?
that &apos;s not true .
you know what ? i think i &apos;ve said too much .
how about that lemonade ?
ma &apos;am , where would you like this ?
oh , upstairs . i &apos;ll show you .
here . drink this .
you look a little pale . i &apos;ll be right back .
don &apos;t tell bree .
don &apos;t tell bree .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i broke a glass .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll get it .
well , ok .
i have to go .
oh , bree . wait .
i understand why you might feel a little threatened
about my moving in here .
but in time you &apos;ll see i &apos;m perfectly harmless .
so , how was the mystery date ?
uh ... it was fabulous . thanks for asking .
come on , i want details . who is he ?
some global financier .
saw me on the cover of paris match .
good @-@ looking . just not my type .
really ? because i always thought that you and zach
would make a really great couple .
you son of a bitch . you were there ?
parked across the street , laughing my ass off .
i can &apos;t believe you followed me !
i thought you were meeting a psycho killer for lunch .
i was worried .
at least they brought out the crayons and children &apos;s menus .
all right . off my porch .
ok , but don &apos;t forget , you asked me to watch your back .
yeah , yeah , about that ,
i &apos;m installing an alarm system tomorrow ,
so i &apos;m not going to need you to look after me anymore .
gabby , i don &apos;t mind .
i mind .
we &apos;re divorced .
i can &apos;t keep running to you every time i get scared .
i want to be the kind of woman who can take care of herself .
well , good for you .
i &apos;m still right down the block .
so if you do need me ...
i won &apos;t .
but thank you .
you &apos;re home early .
i &apos;m celebrating .
we got our liquor license today .
really ? that &apos;s great .
yeah .
andrew said he went all over the neighborhood
and get signatures .
good for him .
but i think he &apos;s lying .
i think somebody else got the signatures .
ok , let &apos;s say , just for the sake of argument ,
that someone else did .
someone who clearly loves you very much .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
nothing . nothing .
order has been restored in the universe .
you saved the day . i &apos;m a loser .
oh , come on , tom .
i tried for two months to get that waiver signed .
you did it in one day . like i said ...
you can &apos;t drown in self @-@ pity just because i helped you
with one tiny little thing .
ok , but if i tell you that the plumbing &apos;s not up to code .
we have termites and the chairs won &apos;t be there
until after we open , can i drown in self @-@ pity ?
why haven &apos;t you told me about all of this ?
because i wanted to accomplish something on my own .
i &apos;m the man . i shouldn &apos;t have to run to my wife to bail me out .
gambling with our life savings and not asking for help
doesn &apos;t make you a man ,
it makes you an idiot .
come on , tom . for god sakes ,
we are a team .
that restaurant is a huge undertaking .
no one could do it alone .
you don &apos;t ask me for help with your ad campaigns .
i don &apos;t have to !
you &apos;re always giving it to me .
inspiring me . remember the mouthwash jingle ?
you came up with the hook .
and what about the bartlett campaign ?
would i have ever come up with tango dancing fleas ?
all you .
there &apos;s nothing that i &apos;ve accomplished that
i could have done without your help .
ok , fine . i help , we &apos;re a team .
just don &apos;t hit me again .
so , tomorrow , first thing , we &apos;ll fix the plumbing ,
we &apos;ll call an exterminator , we &apos;ll rent some chairs
and we will open on time
and it &apos;ll be a glorious success
that you will have achieved with my help .
ok ?
ok .
tonight i &apos;m going to slap on some sex perfume
you &apos;re gonna get naked
and then we &apos;re gonna see who the man is .
god , i hope it &apos;s me .
oh , i &apos;m sure it will be .
hey , mom . what &apos;re you doing out here ?
ok , here &apos;s the thing .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not going to get mad . just sit down .
you know what upset me the most ?
that you didn &apos;t trust me enough to tell me the truth .
i tried to . you freaked out .
well , of course i freaked out . i &apos;m a parent .
you know , we hope that our children
will wait to have sex until after we &apos;re dead .
and you wonder why i went to edie .
ok , that &apos;s the other thing .
that cannot happen anymore .
you and i have always had an amazing relationship .
let &apos;s not mess it up now .
ok . i &apos;m sorry .
look , i know you think i &apos;m too young ,
but austin and i are in love .
yeah . um ...
about that ...
god , i just wish there was a pill
you could take to protect your heart .
what do you mean ?
honey , i was over at edie &apos;s today
and i walked in the door ...
yes , i need to speak to my husband .
yes , there is .
would you please ask him to come home
as early as possible tonight ?
thank you .
&lt; i &gt; it &apos;s a dangerous world . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; so we all look for protection . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and whether we find it in the arms of our mother , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or at the end of a jagged blade . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; in the kiss of our sweetheart , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; or at the end of a barrel , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; we do what we have to to feel safe . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; because we know somewhere in the world ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... there are those who would do us harm . &lt; / i &gt;
