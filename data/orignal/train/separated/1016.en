"Realists don't fear the results of their study."
Then why don't you find me
more favorable results, Dostoyevsky?
I hit everybody who would or could know
about the damn music box.
Nothing's coming up.
Keep looking.
Moz.
Ah. Your anonymous chess opponent again.
Why aren't you more curious about who's sending them?
I like the mystery.
Your girlfriend's missing.
You can't find the one thing that might free her.
One could say there's enough mystery in your life.
Where's the postmark from on this one?
There isn't one.
There isn't one?
As in, someone hand-delivered this card to your door?
This is odd.
The other cards are blank, but the new one has a picture
of the Museum of Natural History on it.
A good mystery makes life interesting.
You know the Chinese curse --
"May you live in interesting times."
You know that's the first of two curses.
What's the other one?
"May you find what you're looking for."
What's the move?
Uh, knight to D7.
Knight to D7.
You've done this move before, haven't you?
Moz, I know who I'm playing.
Keller. This was our last game.
Keller?
Looks like he's in New York.
Who won?
I don't know. We never finished playing.
High Profile Burglary-N.Y. Museum of Natural History
Neal.
Peter.
You're here early.
So are you.
Whatcha doin'?
Research.
Heist of the American Museum of Natural History.
Not your normal hotbed of crime and intrigue.
Yeah. It's probably nothing.
Hold on.
Interesting list of items stolen --
antique cork duck decoys from the storeroom.
They also took wax-sealed supply lists and
French soil samples that belonged to Dr. John Bartram.
The father of American botany.
Just playing a hunch?
Oh, they already have a suspect.
They caught a guy stuffing his backpack.
Manuel Campos.
He's out on bail today.
Maybe we should go talk to him.
We could do that.
I think it's great you've taken an interest
in a small-time museum heist.
History is important.
Yes. Duck decoys and French soil samples.
You don't want me looking into this. Why?
I don't want to waste your time with a hunch.
Cut the crap. What's going on here?
Look, I'm being honest with you, Peter. I don't know yet.
All right, clearly, there's something bigger going on.
I don't believe for a minute this Campos is the mastermind,
and neither do you.
Who's pulling the strings, and why do I give a damn?
I have a theory.
Look out! Look out.
Manuel!
Oh, my God, Manuel!
That's Campos.
You're gonna tell me what the hell is going on.
Right.
Manuel Campos just died in I.C.U.
His wife's a mess, says she didn't see the driver.
NYPD's out of leads.
Tell me who's responsible for this.
His name is Matthew Keller.
He's the blue-collar version of me.
Keller? He's been on our radar before.
And he always slipped off.
Interpol has linked him to everything
from arms smuggling to stolen antiquities.
Yeah, but they never had anything more than hearsay.
Keller has never been caught.
All right, who is he? Some kind of rival of yours?
More like an opponent.
We met at the Grand Casino,
cut our teeth in Monaco working the World Backgammon finals.
Last I heard, he pulled the Stockholm Airport robbery.
Drove right up to a flight unloading krugerrands.
Left fake bombs on the runway so no one could follow him.
You met him playing backgammon?
It was simpler times.
If this is Keller,
I'm guessing he posted Campos's bail
so he could get rid of him.
All right.
What's with the museum heist - the cork and the wax?
It was a bet Keller and I made a long time ago --
Counterfeit a bottle of wine owned by Ben Franklin.
You and your wine. That's why people are dying on the street?
Marie Antoinette gave Franklin a bottle of chateau du munn.
It's rumored to be in private hands,
but it's never gone to auction.
The point is, the Franklin Bottle can't be counterfeited.
It's a challenge --
figure out who can pull off the impossible.
May the best man win.
I don't care about your rivalry.
If he's my killer, I want him.
Let's check around,
See if there's any chatter on this bottle.
Mr. Cattigan.
Sir Roland Cattigan.
Sir Cattigan.
You know about this Franklin bottle?
Yes. A seller will be presenting it on Friday,
and we will be adding it to Weatherby's Auction.
Who is the seller?
May I ask why the FBI wants to know?
It's a forgery.
Oh, that's quite impossible. The Franklin Bottle --
Can't be faked. I've heard.
Well, my seller wishes to remain anonymous.
Then you're gonna have to disappoint him.
Tell me, Agent, do you fashion yourself a wine aficionado?
I like a good pinot now and then.
Pinot. You've seen "sideways."
Your point?
My point is that my palate is insured by Lloyd's of London
for a million euros.
My point is that you don't understand the subtleties of my business.
I think I do.
Word gets out a high-profile bottle like this is fake,
you're done.
Now, I don't want to shut your business down
and search your premises with a warrant.
But I will.
I don't know the seller.
But the broker for the bottle
is a woman named Grace Quinn.
Satisfied?
I believe I am.
What's this?
My search warrant.
Put me down for moo shu pork.
I'm a bad influence.
Our broker's name is Grace Quinn.
Says here that she runs an upscale wine cellar
called Bin 903.
Think we can link her to Keller?
Let me talk to her.
What?
You can't go asking around with a badge.
You'll scare him off.
I'll tell her I'm representing a client
who's interested in the bottle,
See what I can dig up.
You know where to find me.
Always do.
Chateau latour, mouton rothschild.
A case of Petrus, 1945.
That's a serious collection.
Look, my client doesn't want his ex-wife --
or the I.R.S. - To know about his holdings.
That's not uncommon. We're very discreet here.
If you'd like to bring him by,
I'm hosting a private wine tasting
to celebrate Weatherby's annual sale.
Does that invite extend to me?
If you bring your client, it does.
We'll be opening some rare bottles.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
My client is a very cautious man.
It'll help if I can give
him a firsthand account of the facilities.
Any chance I can get a tour?
Of course.
Right this way.
As you'll see, our vault is state-of-the-art.
Humidity is at a constant 62%,
Temp at 50 degrees fahrenheit.
Nice.
Ooh! Sorry about that.
It's okay. That's what it's here for.
We change the code every day.
Good.
I notice you don't have surveillance cameras.
We consider our clients' anonymity to be top priority.
I assume it's something
a cautious man like your client would appreciate.
Well, you assume right, Grace.
Shall we?
Chateau du Munn, post-French revolution.
Nice.
Who's the collector?
I can't say.
Wouldn't happen to be the same individual
auctioning the Franklin bottle on Friday?
I can't comment on that bottle.
But, uh, no.
It's not the same individual.
Seems more his speed.
That I can neither confirm nor deny.
Let's be honest with each other.
I know you're brokering the sale.
You shouldn't.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be very good at my job, ms. Quinn.
Your client must be well-connected.
That I can neither confirm nor deny.
I'd love to meet the seller of the bottle sometime.
He's been here recently, hasn't he?
What makes you say that?
A man of his taste, I'm sure he has an appreciation for history.
As do I.
May I?
Be my guest.
"King's crown --
"Tavern once frequented by George Washington,
now long buried under Water Street."
Fascinating.
I get the message.
What's up, Peter?
How did your chat go with ms. Quinn?
I didn't find anything on Keller.
You think he finished the forgery?
Maybe. Look, I don't know.
Did you find anything on your end?
I might know why he's running this scam,
and it's got nothing to do with you.
Am I supposed to feel relieved?
I would be. I contacted Interpol.
Their sources say he's got a big bull's-eye on his back.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That Stockholm heist he pulled?
It was bankrolled with Russian mob money.
Seems the comrades got a little upset
when he skipped Europe without giving them their cut.
If they catch him now, they'll kill him.
Unless he promised the Russians their money back and then some.
He's gonna pay off his debt with the money from the bottle.
I want you here first thing in the morning.
I want to find Keller before they do.
Me too.
Matthew Keller.
See you got my postcards.
Thanks for keeping in touch.
We never did get to finish our game.
Aren't you curious to see who wins?
Not anymore.
Manuel Campos died today.
I'm sorry -- who? - Your thief.
He had a wife.
Still afraid to get dirty, huh, Caffrey?
Violence requires no imagination.
Anyone can use a gun...
or a car.
That's why you'll always be second-rate --
You're too weak to do what's necessary to get what you want.
Including Kate, from what I heard.
Nice try.
But you officially lost that one.
You were in prison for what, four years?
Missed a lot of valentine's days.
I forgot how endearing it was when she talks in her sleep.
I should've warned you, but we're, uh...
at the edge of your leash here.
Might want to take it easy.
Imagine how I felt
when I discovered that you, of all people,
were working for the feds.
I step forward, and a dozen FBI agents
will be here in minutes.
That right? Be my guest.
Only one they'd have sufficient cause to arrest is you.
Really?
Yeah.
Trespassing? Ugh. Come on, Neal.
You're clutching at straws here.
They got all Capone on tax evasion.
You flatter me with the comparison.
What do you want?
I want to play the game.
The franklin bottle?
Yeah. I want to know who's the best.
You already submitted yours for the auction.
Guess you won.
You never could follow through, Caffrey.
That's why Kate went looking for something else.
I'll give you the first piece.
Now let's play the game.
You got 10 days.
What is this?
A challenge.
Okay, where'd you get it?
Keller. He wants a face-off.
Gave me the first piece
to forge my own Franklin Bottle.
Awfully sporting of him.
Well, not exactly.
Gave himself a big head start.
Why do I get the feeling this isn't about the bottle?
Moz --
It's about Kate.
It always was between you and Keller.
Like he ever had a chance.
It doesn't matter what it was about. Keller killed a man.
Oh, sure, sure. Now you're the noble warrior.
Okay, what's the plan?
I'm gonna beat him. He gave me the bottle.
Now we need to fill it, cork it,
seal it, and label it.
You like scavenger hunts?
I've been known to uncover an easter egg or two in my time.
What's on the list?
You saw Keller.
I did.
Damn it Neal. I could've done this right.
I could've taken him down --
On what, exactly?
He's completely clean. That's how he works.
Doesn't take away the fact
that you should've cleared it with me first.
You're right. I should've.
You should've.
Weatherby's received Keller's bottle this morning.
Wow. It's good.
Yeah. It's also our only piece of evidence
linking Keller to Campos's murder,
And it's locked in a vault.
Might as well be at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean,
considering how circumstantial all of this is.
I'm assuming a takeout menu won't fly this time?
Nope.
Unless we can convince them it's a fake.
That Cattigan guy won't stop the auction
just because we claim it's a fake.
And we need proof that it is.
We can submit a Franklin Bottle of our own.
There's only one bottle in existence, right?
If I turn in a fake that's just as good as Keller's,
they'll have to test them both.
What kind of test?
Standard stuff -
carbon date the cork,
run a molecular test on the wax,
spectroscopic refraction on the glass.
Stuff they got from the museum heist.
Right.
His bottle will pass those, and so will mine.
That'll force the auction house to run a cesium test.
They don't like to run them because they're so expensive,
but it's a way to determine the age
of the wine inside the bottle without opening it.
Cesium 137 doesn't exist in nature.
After they detonated the first atomic bomb,
it spread around the world.
Anything that was bottled before 1945 --
Like the real Franklin Bottle --
Right -- is cesium free.
If Keller's bottle has it, it's a fake.
Why can't I just get some 100-year-old wine and fill it up?
There's the rub.
They'd know you just added it
because the oxygen content would be too high,
and that's why it can't be forged.
And you think you can beat this cesium test?
No. Nobody can. It's impossible.
And that's the beauty of it.
You force the test. You both fail.
It proves that Keller's bottle's a counterfeit.
We got him on fraud.
It's not murder, but it's a start.
How you gonna put the bottle together?
Already got a man on it.
How's it coming?
Moz.
Overreact much?
What are you gonna do with tweezers?
The shinobi ninja can fashion a weapon out of anything.
You're not a ninja.
That's exactly what I want you to believe.
How's the bottle coming?
Oh, I, uh, paid off a guard at that maritime exhibit
for French cork made before the industrial revolution.
We got our newspaper.
What is this -- a New York gazette from 1785?
They use it for insulation in the walls
at the colonial alehouse.
That's perfect.
There's only one egg missing from our basket.
Wax.
Preferably 18th-century beeswax
from the chateau Du Munn Vineyard.
Grace -- Keller's broker --
has a few chateau du munn in her vault.
How much wax do we need?
Not much.
I can make it work with just a few shavings.
How's the security there?
Good.
Keypad with a rotating code,
biometric scanner plate --
with pulse monitor.
Ohh. That makes it trickier.
So, how do you get in?
Have her open the door.
For you?
No.
For my client -- Carlton Leed.
Who's that?
No.
That's your favorite word, isn't it?
It's a classic -- "Nope, "
"Never," "Forget about it."
What makes you think I would break into any place with you
and steal anything?
No, we are not breaking in. You'll be shown around.
And we're not stealing anything...
...of value.
All I need are some wax shavings.
It's like taking a lock of hair from the floor of a barbershop.
Theft is theft.
I'm a C.I., not an agent.
I don't have the same restrictions.
We can call this one a gray area.
Nada.
Come on.
You can get all dressed up, hobnob with pretty people,
drink a fine glass of port.
From everything you know about me,
what makes you think I'd enjoy any of what you just said?
Because this is about catching a killer.
A wax shaving for a murderer.
This won't affect the value of anything in Grace's collection?
Nope. No. Nada.
And for the record, I hate port.
It's syrupy.
There will be other options.
I still say this tie is ridiculous.
It's Italian. And it looks good.
Well, I feel like I should be flossing my teeth with it,
not wearing it around my neck.
All right,
The sooner we can get Grace to show us the cellar,
The sooner you can get back to your favorite pair of sweatpants.
Now, I know wine isn't your thing --
It's a tasting, Neal.
You nose a bottle, take a sip,
and say something pretentious
Like, "Rich, with nice body."
Speaking of...
You made it. You must be Mr. Leed.
Please, call me Carlton.
Grace Quinn.
I hear you're a man of discriminating taste.
I hope we find something to your liking today.
Love your tie.
She loves the tie.
Yeah.
We'll be starting with a 1985 Chateau Petrus Pomerol.
Great year. You're not holding back.
What do you think?
I'd say it's, uh, woodsy,
with a medium body and a hint of --
The lady asked what I thought.
The use of wood is evident in its broadness of flavors.
Great persistence in the mouth.
It opens up well in the glass.
I would agree.
I understand you have a more...
substantial private collection?
Would you care to see the vault?
Your friend's not coming?
Uh, no, I don't need a babysitter.
Please, allow me.
And you're a gentleman, too.
As you can see, our security system is state-of-the-art.
Really?
Would you like to try something else?
I'd love some. Thank you.
There you are.
Chateau Dumunn, post-French Revolution.
Ms. Quinn,
I have a question about the Chateau Petrus.
Sorry to interrupt.
Mm. Please. Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
I guess you just have one of them faces, huh?
Mind filling this up for me?
Of course.
Thank you.
Now I got it.
Yeah, I saw you earlier.
You, uh, came in with your friend.
Where'd he get off to, anyway?
I don't know. I'm not his keeper.
You're not, huh?
See, I think you are.
And now I'm wondering what would happen
if I ask the security guard to check the vault...
Right now.
I mean, I'm wondering what that does to a lawman's career,
when his errand boy gets caught
breaking into somebody's private property?
And I'm having a hard time figuring out
Why I don't book you for murder one...Right now.
Is that right?
How about I get Grace to lock this vault down?
What are the cops gonna find when they look inside?
Cellar full of dusty, overpriced wine.
You know what?
I'm glad you brought in the FBI, Caffrey.
Makes it exciting, right?
Be that much richer when I beat you.
Oh, I forgot to tell you - He's a big fan of himself.
I noticed that.
By the way,
I heard that somebody mowed down a citizen
right in front of an FBI agent?
What a shame.
That's got to be embarrassing for the bureau, right?
Good luck with that investigation.
I spent five minutes with the guy.
I want to punch him right in the face.
Imagine how I feel.
You'll feel better when we take him down.
This can't be good.
Why does everyone say that
when I walk into their office?
So, you have good news?
No.
I contacted the auction house.
They're closed to new entries.
Closed? We can't submit our bottle?
Sorry, Peter.
Now, quit the fool's errands and catch this guy.
You've outdone yourself, Moz.
Flatterer. What's next?
I set up the vacuum pumps...
and transfer the wine.
Expecting someone?
Keller, maybe?
June?
No.
Peter. Hey. What are you doing here?
Got some bad news.
The auction house is closed to new entries.
I appreciate your a-team run here, guys,
But I can't let you take your bottle to Weatherby's.
It's Hughes. He pulled the plug.
If we don't,
they won't run the cesium test.
Keller will get away with a half-million dollars
and probably murder.
What if he wins?
Or worse, what if you win?
This guy will stop at nothing.
That's why we have to stop him.
No offense, but your team... Hasn't.
You're right.
Keep going. Let's take him down.
Finish?
Lactose.
See you in the morning. I'll call Jones
and figure out a way to get this bottle into the auction.
Let's go, Haversham.
Morning, Peter.
Morning.
I got nothing on the auction house.
Weatherby's looks pretty damn legit.
Damn. We need some kind of leverage.
So Cattigan will let our bottle in.
Keller really got to you, huh?
Yeah, he's a piece of work.
He and Neal may be rivals,
but he's the anti-Caffrey,
the bizarro Neal.
What, you got something?
Yeah, they had lousy weather in France this summer --
couple of blazing-hot months.
The grape harvest came up short.
That's good?
Yeah.
1947 was not a good year.
$40,000.
$45,000. Thank you very much.
$50,000. Thank you, Sir.
$50,000 with the gentleman on my right. $50,000.
$55,000.
$55,000 with the lady in the back.
$55,000.
$55,000.
$60,000. Thank you, sir.
$60,000.
I see European nobles and a handful of hedge-fund managers,
but no sign of your buddy Keller.
It's hard to arrest him on fraud if he doesn't show up.
Keller wouldn't miss the chance
to see my face when this goes down.
He must be watching.
So, he could be anywhere.
No, he'll be nearby,
just in case anything goes wrong.
Doesn't help us much.
You think we can get this into the auction?
I have a move up my sleeve.
I'm sorry, I can't submit your bottle
since clearly it has to be counterfeit.
One of them has to be.
How do you know it's not yours?
We have reason to believe this is the real bottle.
Where did you get it?
We're not at liberty to say.
I won't admit it to the auction.
You sure about that?
Last year, you sold six magnums
of Chateau Lafleur, 1947,
at about $50,000 a bottle.
That's public record.
I talked to the vineyard.
They only produced five magnums that year.
You don't want people knowing you got scammed, do you?
Bad for business.
I guess you'll have to test them both to find out.
I can't. It will take at least three hours. The auction --
Can wait three hours.
My client welcomes the challenge.
Figured he might.
Oh, while we wait, why don't you give me the I.P. Addresses
of everyone watching on your internet feed?
Thanks.
Hey, boss. How's it going?
They're running the test now.
Congrats.
Yeah, not celebrating yet.
How's it going in there?
We're tracing those I.P.s.
Any hits?
Three locations -- the Carlyle, the Peninsula,
and a parking garage.
Who'd be watching from a parking garage?
Somebody who wants to be on the move.
Send units to the hotels,
but put the bulk of our guys on the parking garage.
They're about to announce the results of the test.
We're about to move on Keller.
Sounds like "checkmate" to me.
Thank you again for your patience.
We apologize for the delay, but as some of you are aware,
we have had to conduct a cesium test
to verify the authenticity
of the two bottles we have been presented with.
The test shows that one of the bottles is a forgery.
"One of the bottles"?
The other, represented by Miss Grace Quinn,
is authentic.
Thank you for your patience.
The bidding will commence shortly.
You said it was impossible to fake.
It is impossible.
Unless he had the...
...Real bottle all along.
If Keller had the real bottle,
why would he go through all this?
Why pretend to have a fake?
He wanted to drive up the price. Damn! That's it.
Surround the bottle with controversy.
Now everyone in here is dying to get their hands on it.
It'll go for double, even triple the price now.
Which gives him more than enough money
to pay off his debt to the Russians.
And he used me to do it.
This was his plan the whole time. He is good.
We have to arrest him now.
As soon as this auction ends, he's gone.
What am I gonna arrest him on?
I mean, we have nothing on him now.
Trespassing.
What?
I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this,
but have you seen him trespass?
I have, actually, at a construction site.
It had a "No trespassing" sign and everything.
All right, we may not be able to hold him for long,
but finding Keller's gonna take a bit.
All right, well, I'll stall until you can get him.
Nothing...
Illegal, I know.
Hey, Moz, it's me.
Is the auction over?
No. I just stepped outside.
So, how's it going?
Not good.
Keller's bottle is real.
He has the real bottle?
You're kidding me.
Nope.
Then why --
To drive the price up.
Brilliant. And we took the bait.
Did they test both bottles?
Yep.
How did our bottle do?
Passed every test except the cesium.
You did great, Moz. Now, focus. I need your help.
We can still nail this guy.
On what?
I'll tell you later. We got to find him first.
Remember how I told you Keller had a debt to the Russians?
Of course. I have perfect recall.
Well, I'm trying to stall the bidding.
Keller's gonna want to pay these guys off as soon as possible.
Which must mean that they're in town somewhere.
Exactly.
I'll ask around.
Yeah, well, do it fast.
If you find anything, meet me at Weatherby's.
I'll leave a pass for you at the front.
Anything?
Signal's coming
from the northwest corner of the garage.
We've sealed off every entrance and exit.
All right, good.
We're doing a floor-by-floor search, people, starting now.
I want everyone prepared. This guy could be armed.
Nobody gets out.
I must say, it appears this spot of intrigue
has whetted appetites.
So, without further ado,
we'll open the bidding at $100,000.
What did you find out?
I did follow-up on your suit's intel.
Turns out, the Russians are indeed after Keller.
They want their money now.
And Sergei himself is in town.
He wants personal assurance from Keller
that he's gonna get paid the moment this auction is done.
I got an idea.
Anything?
No, nothing yet.
Clear.
Clear over here.
Damn it. All right, next floor. Let's move.
$375,000, ladies and gentlemen.
$375,000 from the gentleman on my right.
$400,000 on the phone.
Do I hear $425,000?
No one inside.
Look at this.
Son of a bitch must have seen us coming.
He's not here.
Security cameras have him fleeing the scene.
He hot-wired another car
two minutes before we cordoned off the building.
So, you have no idea where he is?
We're pulling surveillance on him now with traffic cams.
Didn't have time to take any of his things with him.
His things?
Yeah, he had a laptop he'd been monitoring the auction from.
He's not watching the auction anymore?
Probably not.
Too concerned with getting the hell out of here.
All right, find out where he's headed.
The bidding is now $800,000
to the gentleman on my right.
This is a lousy idea.
Do it, Moz.
These people don't take I.O.U.S.
Fair warning - I can sell for $800,000.
Do it!
$1 million!
Thank you, sir.
$1 million...
And sold!
What did you get us into?
Peter, where are you?
Still in the garage.
What happened?
I won the bid.
What?!
Don't worry. I got a plan.
You usually do.
What's the status on Keller?
Headquarters is monitoring his movement in real time
from traffic cams.
Looks like he's headed south on park.
South on park. Thanks.
I know where Keller's going.
Bravo, Keller. Seriously.
Wow. So, you came by to see me off, huh, Caffrey?
Who knew you were such a gracious loser?
I have to admit,
using the real Ben Franklin bottle --
did not see that coming.
Stroke of genius, really.
Thanks. Actually means a lot coming from you.
Only wish Kate was around to see it.
I mean, we both know, she always loved a winner, right?
Who knows?
Maybe I'll look her up, see if she still does.
So, I'm curious.
How'd you find me?
Checked Sergei's travel plans.
See he does it in style. Hmm.
I also hear he doesn't take it lightly
when someone owes him money.
Owed.
As in past tense.
Hey, see, our little go-round with the bottle
cleared my debts.
In fact, I just got a text from my broker --
bottle went for seven figures.
Wow! Wow, congratulations.
Thank you, thank you. Yeah, yeah.
So, it was a two-birds, one-stone thing?
Humiliate me, turn a hefty profit while you're at it?
See? Now you're catching on, Neal.
Listen, I'd love to chat, buddy,
but unless you got anything else,
I should get going, all right?
Be good.
I haven't made my offer yet.
This should be good.
I'd like to offer you the opportunity
to make a full confession for your crimes.
The robbery of the natural history museum,
the murder of Manuel Campos,
Anything else you want to add in.
You know what? I was wrong.
This isn't good. This is sad, man.
This is a moment I'll cherish --
seeing you at your most desperate.
The winner of the Franklin bottle--
It wouldn't happen to be bidder number 57, would it?
Why?
Now, this is just awkward,
But I don't have a million dollars.
Luckily, the auction house said they'd give me a week
to put the money together.
A week, huh?
Know what? A week's not that long. I can buy that.
Did you tell him I'm launching
a full-blown federal investigation on the bottle?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's that, too.
How long can a federal investigation go on for?
Not sure. Years.
Oh, years. Wow.
You son of a bitch.
How patient are Sergei and your Russian friends?
You could take a helicopter ride and find out.
or you can come with us. Your choice.
Well played.
Good game, Keller.
Game ain't over.
Help this gentleman into the car.
Looks that way to me.
Yeah?
I mean, you were locked up, broke out.
Maybe it's my turn to accept the challenge.
Best two out of three.
I'll see you around, Caffrey.
I'm counting the days.
Guess Sergei's going home empty-handed.
Did I miss Keller?
Damn. I wanted to see him do the perp walk.
Sorry.
Good news is he won't be bothering us for a while.
How long is "A while"?
Maybe long enough to finish our chess game.
Think they have a prison that can hold him?
I don't know.
Okay, so, what's the bad news?
You won't be drinking a million-dollar bottle of wine tonight.
I'll live.
You were right.
I could use one less mystery in my life.
Oh, I rescind that comment.
There's suddenly been a lot of chatter about the music box.
You need to talk to Alex.
She won't tell me anything while I work for the FBI.
