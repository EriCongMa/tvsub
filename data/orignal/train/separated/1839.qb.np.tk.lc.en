i , uh , i grew up on a farm , so , you know , blood--
blood doesn &apos;t-- doesn &apos;t bother me .
i ...
i slaughtered a pig once . that was a lot of blood .
bleeding like a stuck pig--
you know , that &apos;s a--that &apos;s a saying .
to bleed like a pig , you know , it means something .
but you don &apos;t-- you don &apos;t think of people as having that m @-@ much blood .
you learn in med school how many pints we all have in us ,
but you don &apos;t realize it until you see it .
you don &apos;t get how m--how much blood-- and a skinny person .
i mean , my god , reed , she &apos;s--she &apos;s--
she &apos;s like , almost anorexic . she &apos;s like 5 pounds .
you--you wouldn &apos;t think she &apos;d have that much blood in her ,
but she--she did . she did . i mean ,
she-- she--
april . april . april . april .
april . april . shh . you &apos;re in shock .
it &apos;s all right . tell me what happened .
reed &apos;s dead .
someone shot her .
excuse me . could you tell me where to find the chief ?
dr. shepherd ? he &apos;s , uh , probably in his office .
yeah , i &apos;ve been to his office before .
i can &apos;t seem to rember how to get there .
i keep going in circles .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s in the east wing .
that &apos;s over by labs , across the catwalk .
sorry ? that &apos;s--
you just gotta cross through the patient floor on three ,
and then follow the signs to the main lobby ,
and then you should find it no problem .
thank you .
have a nice day .
you , too .
the police are on their way .
what &apos;s the procedure ?
you &apos;re the head of hospital security .
how do you not know ? i know it &apos;s never happened before .
oh , i found it . lockdown . nobody moves in or out .
yeah . nobody moves , nobody breathes
until we know what &apos;s going on .
here .
the police are almost here .
i &apos;m gonna leave you here . you gonna be okay by yourself ?
you &apos;re leaving ? you--you just said that--that nobody leaves ,
nobody moves , nobody breathes .
nobody but me .
i &apos;m the chief . this is my hospital .
but what if you get shot or--or--
i &apos;ll be right back . i &apos;m the chief .
uh , jason perkins ?
uh , i got the chart here somewhere .
peds .
can you page the younger dr. grey for me
and tell her to get my appy moving ?
we &apos;re on lockdown .
what ? why ?
oh , come on .
well , it &apos;s a joke , right ? it &apos;s a drill or something ?
okay . it &apos;s no joke .
everyone . everyone .
we &apos;re sealing the floor .
i don &apos;t know why , and it doesn &apos;t matter why ,
but nobody goes in or out past the double doors .
you check on your own patients , and then you come back
and check and see if there &apos;s any others in the queue .
we don &apos;t have a lot of hands on deck .
and , people , do not alarm the makers of the tiny humans .
they will eat you alive . let &apos;s go .
i really thought that was a joke .
a sick joke .
excuse me ?
uh , nothing .
what ?
what , you can &apos;t be stuck on the same floor as me ?
that &apos;s a hardship for you ?
uh , yeah . frankly , it is .
hey . how are we ?
bill hasn &apos;t come back with my pizza yet ,
so still starving .
but full of fresh blood ,
which is disgusting , like i &apos;m a vampire .
mary , you complain too much .
but i do it with a smile .
face it . i &apos;m an awesome patient .
i make your day .
hmm . let &apos;s see .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing . j @-@ just a ... page .
i can &apos;t get control of this artery . he &apos;s crashing .
all right , i need more light and another clamp .
how &apos;s it gong in here ?
touch and go .
avery , you got a second ?
has anybody checked their pager ?
no , we &apos;ve been too busy .
there &apos;s a shooter in the hospital .
i don &apos;t want you to say a word . when the patient is stable ...
i want you to tell hunt and altman
that nobody goes out of here until they are told .
can you handle this ?
yes , sir .
all right .
okay . okay , b.p. is dropping .
i &apos;ve almost got the pulmonary artery under control .
just give me one more second .
what did shepherd want ?
dr. avery ?
nothing . um , just wanted to know how long we &apos;d be .
he needs the o.r. next .
okay , get in here
and suction around where dr. altman &apos;s working .
shaky hands , dr. avery ?
won &apos;t make it as a surgeon
if you can &apos;t keep your hands steady .
yes , sir .
did you get that page ? lockdown ?
yeah . i mean , whatever . it means we can &apos;t leave .
i never leave here anyway so what do i care ?
you know what ? it &apos;s probably just a drill .
or , like , a psych patient got out
or a baby went missing from the nursery ...
or there &apos;s a--there &apos;s an ax murderer on the loose .
ax murderer would be fun .
mm @-@ hmm . so ? how did he react ?
i mean , was his world made whole
bcecause your womb is not empty and dry ?
did he weep like a bitch baby ?
i didn &apos;t tell him because he was in a mood .
so i &apos;ll tell him later tonight or something .
i mean , it should be special , right ? -
well , i mean , you found out
in the ladies room squatting over a stick .
i mean , that wasn &apos;t very special .
why does he get special ?
i don &apos;t know .
i feel like my head &apos;s gonna pop off
because i haven &apos;t told him and i want to and i hate that .
it &apos;s good news . he should know , right ?
you know what ? i &apos;m telling him now .
okay .
what--
well , i &apos;m coming .
well , i want to see the bitch baby tears .
cristina-- i &apos;ll just stand in the hallway .
he &apos;ll never know i &apos;m there .
i , um ...
i @-@ i broke up with owen . okay ?
okay .
come on .
they want attending approval
to do the auditory evoked potentials .
can you sign for it ?
lockdown . kinda crazy , right ?
you think it &apos;s , uh , serious ?
can you just sign the order ?
this karev thing serious ?
mark .

officer , what &apos;s the situation ?
sir , you gotta stand back .
look , i &apos;m richard webber . i &apos;m--i &apos;m the chief--
i &apos;m the former--
look , this is my hospital . what &apos;s going on ?
a shooter took down one of the doctors .
and we &apos;re not sure whether or not he &apos;s still inside .
no , sir , sir , sir . no one in , no one out .
the--the s.w.a.t. team is on the way , sir .
no one in , no one out .
are you evacuating people ?
are you getting them out of there ?
because-- department policy is a lockdown .
until we know who the shooter is ,
where the shooter is , everyone stays in the same place .
it &apos;s safer that way .
those are my people in there .
if someone is shooting , i &apos;d--
my guys have this . we do . we &apos;re gonna take care of it .
okay ?
okay .
what--what--what happened ?
i grabbed everything i could think of .
i am ... so ... incredibly pissed off right now .
alex , you &apos;ve been shot .
we have to get him out of here .
he could come back , mark .
we have to get him out of here .
there &apos;s no exit wound .
no exit wound . we &apos;re gonna have to flip him .
lexie , grab him under the shoulders .
we have to get him outta here .
lexie , he &apos;losing blood . we can &apos;t move him .
now shut up and help .
nothing .
oh , damn . the bullet &apos;s still in there somewhere .
we &apos;re just gonna have to wing it . start an i.v.
i &apos;ll set up a chest tube .
you &apos;re gonna be okay , alex . all right ?
i &apos;m gonna kick that guy &apos;s ass when i see him .
has anybody seen olivia kagan &apos;s chart ?
uh , i need albuterol nebs for the asthma kid .
it &apos;s time for 18 &apos;s dose of ceftriaxone .
34 needs his mommy .
and the kid in 35 won &apos;t stop crying .
we have , what , 42 kids ,
four doctors and nine nurses ? it &apos;s not enough . all right .
why don &apos;t you just put all the kids in the room ?
i mean , we don &apos;t have enough staff for a whole floor .
so at least they &apos;ll all be in one place , one big room .
we can keep an eye on all the kids at once .
you can &apos;t put a bunch of sick kids in the playroom
with their beds and everything--
n @-@ sure--sure we can . stable ones can walk ,
and we have wheelchairs , so let &apos;s do it . move .
thanks .
whatever .
well , do you want to talk about it ?
no .
owen , i mean ...
i know what you mean . i don &apos;t want to--
i , um , i @-@ i can &apos;t . it &apos;s just ...
okay , he doesn &apos;t know , you know , who he loves ,
and if it &apos;s not me , then ...
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
let &apos;s talk about something else .
okay .
you realize , you &apos;re about to be a godmother ?
i &apos;m godmother ?
okay , what do i have to do ?
like , talk god to the fetus ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not gonna do that .
it means , you take care of the kid if i die .
derek takes care of the kid if you die .
if we die , if we die .
okay , so ...
if you and derek are in a plane crash and you die ,
the kid is mine ?
yes .
i have to admit , i kindhope ,
uh , you and derek die , just a little bit ,
so i can raise the kid with decent priorities .
i have priorities .
oh ?
surgery .
oh , okay , then .
you can raise a good little surgeon .
i take it back .
hey . what are you doing here ?
uh , walkin
we &apos;re in lockdown .
yeah , we &apos;re not walking outside .
that &apos;s not what lockdown means .
it means stay where you are .

so , yeah , i want to talk about this .
okay , fine . i tried being friends .
rising above--i tried that , and now i &apos;m over it .
i &apos;m gonna go the more traditional route
of totally hating your guts .
okay , christopher , tyler .
tyler , christopher . you both hate chicken .
discuss .
yes , i &apos;m a vegan , too .
i don &apos;t deserve this , okay ?
i have treated you with nothing but respect and love--
oh , no . see , that &apos;s the thing .
you think you have , but you haven &apos;t .
i &apos;m sure that it feels great to act like i &apos;m the bad guy ,
but that &apos;s the biggest load of you know what i &apos;ve ever heard .
i have spent the last month trying to convince myself
that i don &apos;t need kids to be happy--
really trying-- giving lectures to myself ,
saying it out loud to you to mark
and turning myself inside out to want what you wanted .
and then i stopped for a second , and i thought ,
did you ever try to imagine what it would
be like to change for me ? because i don &apos;t think you did .
what you did was you dismissed my dream--my dream--
which says to me that you don &apos;t give a rat &apos;s ass if i &apos;m happy .
i never understood squat about who you are .
and now i do , and i don &apos;t like it .
oh , really , really , really ?
i &apos;m supposed to change for you ? why ,
because we &apos;re in love ?
i mean , because you fall in love all the time--men , women--
excuse me . dr. robbins . i don &apos;t feel good .
oh , my--oh , my--
he shot me . i &apos;m shot .
you are going to be okay .
mary , over there is s @-@ some gauze and some surgical pads .
can you get them for me ?
nope . i @-@ i gotta go . i gotta go home . i--
we shouldn &apos;t be here . my husband--
i have to find my husband .
and that man , he could come back in here--
mary . mary .
you &apos;re not going anywhere . okay ?
that man is t coming back .
i need you to pull yourself together ,
bring me those supplies . okay ?
i was doing charts , and now i &apos;m shot ?
okay , okay . you &apos;re just fine . you &apos;re just fine . ah .
thank you . okay . good . very good .

and look and see if there &apos;s anybody out there
that can help us .

and just see if somebody can help us . go on . go on .

he &apos;s dead .
and there &apos;s no one else to help us .
there &apos;s no one else .
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s fine . that &apos;s ...
where--where is that water coming from ?
dr. bailey , you &apos;re crying .
you &apos;re crying .
then , uh , m @-@ mary ...
you need to c @-@ come over here and wipe my face

look at me .
please .
look at me in the eye .
i &apos;m a human being .
i make mistakes .
i &apos;m flawed .
we all are .
today i think ...

you want justice .
you want somebody to pay .
you &apos;re a good man .
i can see that in your eyes .
can you see it in mine ?
can you ?
oh , shepherd . thank god you &apos;re back .
i learned to read in the o.r. gallery .
i played in the morgue .
i colored with crayons on old e.r. charts .
the hospital was my church , my school ,
my home ...
my safe place ,
my sanctuary .
i love it here .
correction--
loved it here .
