第二集
who &apos;s there ? !
i &apos;m just a voice in your head .
think of me as your guide .
someone needs to watch me .
you &apos;re the only one who will do what is necessary .
i &apos;m king arthur of camelot .
we &apos;ve come to find you .
merlin prophesied your coming here a long time ago .
we &apos;re back .
we were just walking into camelot .
how long were we gone ?
six weeks .
our memories are gone .
why are you doing this ?
because ... i am the dark one .
come on .
someone &apos;s got to see what this new curse does .
any volunteers ?
i don &apos;t want to turn into a monkey .
i like remembering who i am .
i &apos;m afraid one of us is gonna have to dig down deep
and find the courage to see what happens
when we step over that line .
not it .
not it .
not it .
not it .
dopey .
i &apos;ll take your silence as bravery . good for you .
come on .
stop !
sorry , sister .
we can &apos;t stay in storybrooke as long as emma &apos;s the dark one .
snow queen , pan , trio of terror .
we can handle villains like that .
but emma ?
she was one of us .
she knows how we beat bad guys --
hell , she beat most of them for us .
so tell me -- how do we stand a chance against her ?
if you &apos;re dumb enough to cross the line , be my guest .
who &apos;s gonna save us if we stay -- you ?
go on . do it .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse us .
no .
well , that &apos;s new .
六周前
wow is right .
i am so not dressed for this .
his royal highness , king arthur .
and now allow me to introduce the loveliest creature
in all of camelot -- my queen , guinevere .
your majesty .
the pleasure is ours .
we have been awaiting your arrival
from the moment we heard merlin &apos;s prophecy .
well , we hope you haven &apos;t been waiting too long .
only a decade or so .
sorry .
i &apos;ll wager it &apos;s been worth the wait .
and as a bonus , it &apos;s given us more than enough time
to prepare a ball in your honor tonight .
see , told you we should come .
look what we &apos;ve been missing out on .
i like any party i don &apos;t have to cater .
so do we .
is this really necessary ?
you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re not locked in granny &apos;s freezer .
take it off .
or i tell arthur he just welcomed
the dark one into his --
what &apos;s that , sis ?
i can &apos;t hear you .
no one here knows who we are , and it &apos;s gonna stay that way .
so you can either behave and pretend
to be my mute handmaiden
or go back to granny &apos;s
where you can rely on doc for prenatal care .
we don &apos;t have time to waste on a bloody dance .
i &apos;m not going to go dark in one night .
i &apos;m not willing to take that chance .
your majesty ...
when are we gonna start our quest to find merlin ?
wh-- find him ? we don &apos;t need to find him .
we know exactly where he is .
so , the most powerful sorcerer in all the realms
is stuck inside a bloody tree ?
i said the same exact thing the first time i stood there .
and you think we can get him out ?
oh , we don &apos;t think -- we know .
merlin &apos;s prophecies are never wrong .
why are you so eager to free him ?
our home is being threatened by ...
it &apos;s called the dark one .
the dark one .
yes , we &apos;re well aware of that demon .
that is bad .
well , i pray merlin can help .
but , first , we must free him from his prison .
it is said one of you is the savior .
so which of you is it ?
i -- - i am the savior .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to free merlin from that tree ,
and then we can take care of the dark one .
and all go home .
true love &apos;s kiss .
i need to know why it didn &apos;t work
for you and the bloody crocodile .
why , it did work , the first time .
it awoke the man behind the beast .
but rumple got scared of a life without power ,
and he chose power over love .
he pulled away from me , and in that moment ,
the darkness forever regained its grip on him .
you know , a curse isn &apos;t a curse anymore
when the afflicted wants it .
that won &apos;t be a problem with emma .
killian , wait .
i know you think you can handle a dark --
i &apos;ve battled him for centuries . i &apos;m still here .
but you were trying to kill him .
and now , well ...
it &apos;s far easier to hate a dark one
than it is to love one .
be careful .
emma swan , emma swan ,
emma swan .
henry .
mom ?
you don &apos;t have to be scared of me .
what happened ?
why are you like this now ?
it &apos;s complicated .
i &apos;m sorry , mom .
whatever happened in camelot ,
i &apos;m sorry we failed you .
i know what i said last night , but , henry , you didn &apos;t fail me .
everyone else did .
get away from my son .
what &apos;s the matter , regina ?
are you afraid henry will learn the truth
about what happened in camelot ?
if the truth is so important to you ,
why did you erase our memories ?
it &apos;s a curse , regina .
i know , but what i can &apos;t figure out is why .
if i wanted you to know ,
i wouldn &apos;t have erased your memories .
you know we won &apos;t stop until we get them back .
it &apos;s not going to happen , regina ,
because i did learn from you , and i built this curse
without the one thing you need to break it --
a savior .
well , we &apos;ll find a way . we always have .
yes , with me .
now you &apos;re on your own .
you can do it , mom .
you can be the savior .
it &apos;s not going to happen .
you don &apos;t think i have it in me ?
i know you don &apos;t .
well , you &apos;re wrong .
i can protect this town .
we &apos;ll see about that ,
because there &apos;s a problem headed to storybrooke
that only a savior can solve .
it &apos;s too bad there isn &apos;t one .
we just can &apos;t leave him there . he &apos;ll starve .
what do trees eat ?
sunlight ?
he liked tacos .
yeah ? how the hell are we gonna give a tree a taco ?
yeah .
didn &apos;t anyone ever teach you
not to mess with a dwarf and his pickaxe ?
didn &apos;t anyone ever teach you to kneel before a king ?
now , tell me -- where am i and how the hell did i get here ?
a curse ?
that brought you to our realm
and wiped the last six weeks from your memory .
who would do that ?
we weren &apos;t completely honest with you on the way to camelot .
‭ our daughter , emma , was --
is the dark one .
she cast the curse .
you lied to me ?
you let me lead the darkest of souls
into the heart of my kingdom ?
we thought merlin would be able
to destroy the darkness inside her .
well , obviously that didn &apos;t work out .
where &apos;s the dark one now ?
emma .
she &apos;s here in storybrooke .
well , then there &apos;s only one way to defeat her --
the dark one dagger .
defeat isn &apos;t exactly what we had in mind .
she &apos;s our daughter , and ...
well , she has the dagger .
i &apos;m afraid you and your knights
aren &apos;t the only ones that emma dragged here from camelot .
little john said he ran into some of your subjects
in the forest .
are they all right ?
they &apos;re a little shaken up ,
but there may still be some of them out there .
i &apos;m gonna round up the merry men and search the east woods .
i &apos;ll take the dwarfs . we &apos;ll start in the west .
arthur , you &apos;re with me .
what is it ?
these toy soldiers .
i could kill them all with a wave of my hand .
regina !
well , i don &apos;t mean i will .
my point is , this can &apos;t be what emma warned me about .
she obviously brought them here for a reason .
she said we were going to face a problem
only a savior can handle .
i &apos;m telling you ,
something else is coming our way .
merlin &apos;s tower .
there must be something in here
to help get him out of the tree .
never do that to me again .
now you &apos;re talking to me .
i don &apos;t know -- am i allowed to ?
you gave this to me .
to protect me , not use against me .
i saved your life .
by pretending to be me ?
oh , shut up and listen .
i can get used to this .
look , if you told arthur you were the savior ,
he would have asked you to free merlin .
you would have had to use magic-- dark magic .
do you remember what happened last time you dabbled in that ?
i lost control .
and you gave me this dagger so that wouldn &apos;t happen again .
but i wasn &apos;t lying .
i don &apos;t care what merlin &apos;s prophecy says .
i &apos;m gonna figure out how i can get that wizard out
so you won &apos;t ever have to use dark magic again .
so , really , swan , you should be thanking me .
thank you .
whatever .
regina ...
i mean it .
thank you .
we covered the forest .
i think we found everyone who came over .
regina .
regina .
i &apos;m sorry . i was just ...
what ? what happened ?
what did emma say to you ?
she said nobody believes
i can protect this town .
that &apos;s not true .
everybody knows how far you &apos;ve come .
well , they may not see me as the evil queen anymore ,
but i need to prove to them i can be more .
forgiving me is one thing , but ...
it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re ready to be led by me ,
ready to trust me .
arthur !
guinevere .
thank god you &apos;re all right .
i feared the worst .
where is it ?
where is excalibur ?
i &apos;m afraid it was missing when i arrived here .
don &apos;t worry .
if your sword &apos;s here , we &apos;ll find it .
you know of excalibur .
how ?
in this realm , you &apos;re kind of a legend .
daddy !
regina !
help !
where are you ?
don &apos;t make me summon you , swan .
you just did .
i was looking for you , too .
the new look comes with some other perks .
where the bloody hell are we ?
my place . come on .
what do you think ?
i think i &apos;m surprised you invited me in .
just because i &apos;m the dark one
doesn &apos;t mean we can &apos;t still be together .
i still also know the fastest way
to a pirate &apos;s heart is through his liver .
there &apos;s an even faster way .
now , there &apos;s the pirate i remember .
it didn &apos;t bloody work .
you &apos;ve been talking to belle .
why didn &apos;t it work ?
it didn &apos;t work because there &apos;s nothing to fix . ‬
this is who i am now . why can &apos;t you accept that ?
why can &apos;t anyone accept that ?
because this isn &apos;t you .
what the hell happened in camelot ?
that seems to be the question of the day . ‬
then bloody answer me !
i wish i could .
you can tell me anything .
but that would be no fun .
i &apos;m tired of talking .
now , do you want to stay or not ?
sorry , swan .
this may be who you think you are ,
but this isn &apos;t who i am .
this way !
there it is !
you &apos;re not taking him anywhere .
so , you want to do this the hard way ?
good , because i love the hard way .
regina !
you okay ?
i &apos;m alive , if that &apos;s what you mean .
she needs help .
leroy , get her to the hospital .
no , no , i have to go after --
i have to go after that thing , robin .
you have to get checked out .
you don &apos;t believe i can do this .
that &apos;s what this is .
we won &apos;t let anything happen to him ,
but you need to let someone look at you . ‬
go .
my lady .
for me ?
you are the savior , after all .
his majesty would be honored
if you would wear this to the ball tonight .
i look forward to a dance this evening .
he &apos;s not the only one looking forward
to a dance with the savior .
now , if he gets fussy ,
he probably just needs to be changed .
are you sure you don &apos;t want us to get granny ?
if i go to the ball ,
i &apos;ll just get stuck being grumpy &apos;s wingman .
i can watch him . i &apos;m not going .
but you have to . everyone &apos;s expecting you .
i should be figuring out how to free merlin ,
not fox @-@ trotting my way across club med @-@ ieval .
regina .
what ?
the truth .
i can &apos;t go , all right ?
i can &apos;t .
because why ?
because .
because i don &apos;t know how to dance .
well , that can &apos;t be possible .
you and i went to dozens of balls together .
where your father was more interested in dancing ‬
with his precious daughter than his wife .
i doubt robin hood will mind if you step on a few toes .
this isn &apos;t about robin , is it ?
people are expecting a savior tonight ,
not an ex @-@ evil queen .
how will they ever believe i can free merlin
if i can &apos;t even convince them i know how to dance ?
you can if we teach you .
no .
doc .
your majesty .
wait , sorry .
the first thing my mother taught me about dancing --
you have to learn to move in a dress ,
not a sensible pantsuit .
fine .
what ?
it &apos;s a little ... scary .
what he means is if you want people to see you as the savior ,
maybe you should go for something a bit less evil ?
now , that is perfect .
and it even matches your necklace .
all right , follow me .
just feel it .
step back with your left . all right ?
and -- oh , oh , that &apos;s okay .
that &apos;s all right . you &apos;re fine , you &apos;re fine .
ready ?
and ... one , two , three .
one , two , three . there you go .
now , when we &apos;re done ,
everyone in camelot will believe you &apos;re the savior .
i remember my first ball .
i was 8 years old , and my mother said
i was finally old enough to go .
it was magical --
all of the lights , the music .
and i remember thinking , &quot; i can &apos;t wait to someday share
all of this with a daughter of my own . &quot;
i &apos;m glad i get to share it with you , too , mom .
presenting lady emma and lady mary margaret .
swan , you look ...
i know .
presenting the savior .
you son of a bitch .
you made me like this .
you made me the evil queen .
you &apos;re the reason no one believes in me .
and i &apos;m gonna prove you wrong .
i &apos;m gonna prove them all wrong .
i just ...
regina , i , uh -- i found something .
a fury ?
a demon sent from the underworld
to collect the unpaid price of magic .
someone used magic in camelot and didn &apos;t pay up .
yeah , but , regina ,
the fury doesn &apos;t come for just any price .
it comes when the price for magic is a life .
robin .
y @-@ you mean that demon is here to drag him to the underworld ?
yeah ,
but the portal only opens when the moon reaches the zenith .
then there &apos;s still some time to stop it .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not that simple .
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s only one way to save robin hood .
someone has to give their life in his place .
you know what i see when i see that rose ?
hope .
hope ?
but every petal that falls brings rumple closer to death .
and every petal still on the stem
is another chance to save him .
thanks , leroy .
would , uh -- would you care to dance ?
david , look .
uh @-@ oh , first crush .
i &apos;m on it .
you know you could just walk over there and introduce yourself .
that &apos;s your strategy , gramps ? introduce yourself ?
think about it . you &apos;re from another land .
you &apos;re mysterious , intriguing .
use it .
you , uh , looked thirsty .
you mean bored .
thanks .
so , you &apos;re not having fun ?
please .
we have one of these practically every night in camelot .
uh , yeah , it &apos;s pretty lame .
what is that ?
just a gift from -- from the savior .
a gift from the savior ? really ?
more like a token of appreciation
for saving the day when everyone was trapped
in an alternate universe .
yeah , i did that .
how heroic .
are you a knight ?
better -- i &apos;m a writer .
i &apos;m violet . - henry .
may i cut in ?
it would be an honor to dance with the savior .
i trust you &apos;re having a lovely evening .
oh , yes .
everything &apos;s --
who &apos;s that girl talking to my son ?
the better question is , who are you ?
what are you talking about ?
let me tell you a story .
many years ago , a boy returned to his village
in the enchanted forest to find it ablaze .
villagers screaming , terror in their eyes --
his whole world burning like a funeral pyre .
the boy hid , praying for mercy .
but none came ,
only an angel of death .
and she slipped through the flames ,
relishing in the horror she wrought .
but before she escaped , she saw the boy .
and amidst the carnage , do you know what she did ?
she smiled at him .
you were the boy .
and you were the evil queen .
who else knows ? who have you told ?
no one .
why not ?
because arthur would have stopped me from doing this .
regina !
no , swan ! you can &apos;t use dark magic .
robin ! robin !
no !
no !
no , no , no ! no !
no .
swan , where the hell are you ?
you know , it &apos;s customary to bring a gift for a housewarming .
maybe a nice bottle of wine .
we need to talk .
i suppose we could bottle that rage and drink it instead .
you &apos;re right -- i &apos;m not the savior .
glad you finally caught up with the rest of us .
i don &apos;t have a choice .
i know the only way to stop the fury
is to pay its price .
then why aren &apos;t you off paying it ?
because i know what it is .
a life .
i won &apos;t sacrifice someone else to save robin .
now you &apos;re going to be heroic ?
now life is precious to you ?
emma ... listen to me .
i know you .
the good you ... is still in there .
you of all people know there are no
good or bad versions of ourselves . it is just me .
then call the fury off .
it &apos;s your test .
no .
no ? - let me make myself clear , regina --
i am done fixing your problems .
my problems ? ! you started this .
you called it here .
oh , you think i did this ?
would i be here otherwise ?
that &apos;s your problem , regina --
you &apos;re always looking for someone else to blame .
i did not summon that monster .
the price is not mine to pay .
then whose is it ?
yours .
you are the one who did not pay the price of magic in camelot .
you want to save robin hood ?
you want everyone to believe you &apos;re the savior ?
then step up and do what needs to be done !
can you heal him ?
why didn &apos;t it work ?
this sword was enchanted to kill me .
my magic can &apos;t heal him .
but maybe yours can .
no . no , we can &apos;t let her use dark magic .
regina , this was the whole point
of your pretending to be the savior .
the whole point was not for robin to die .
and i &apos;m not asking you . i &apos;m asking -- i &apos;m asking her .
i don &apos;t know what will happen if i use my powers again .
i can use that dagger to make you do this ,
but i &apos;m not . i &apos;m asking you .
i &apos;ve lost love before , and i won &apos;t again .
please . save him .
all right . i &apos;ll try .
attagirl .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve told you --
i &apos;m here to help you embrace the darkness .
emma , who are you talking to ?
no one .
this is too much for her .
i &apos;m fine . i can do this .
not yet , dearie .
first , you must take a price for the magic .
i won &apos;t take one to save somebody .
well , sorry , dearie , but these are the rules .
i didn &apos;t make them up . there has to be a price .
fine . i &apos;ll pay it .
it doesn &apos;t work that way .
she asked for the magic .
she has to pay it .
it &apos;ll be different .
i &apos;m the savior .
emma , who are you talking to ?
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s okay .
i can do this .
robin ! robin .
regina .
emma , you all right ?
i &apos;m fine .
i feel a little woozy .
i think i &apos;ll lie down for a bit .
you liked the power , didn &apos;t you ?
no . i just did what had to be done .
oh , well , if that were true ,
then why didn &apos;t your kiss stop that ?
tasty , isn &apos;t it -- the darkness ?
there it is ! over there !
what is it ?
no ! stop !
if you want a life , take mine !
regina , what are you doing ? !
what i should have done in camelot !
you don &apos;t have to do this alone .
i &apos;m with you .
me , too !
i &apos;ve got you , sister !
oh , my god .
are you okay ?
are you okay ?
it appears you found a few believers .
how did you know that would work ?
lucky guess .
regina , we weren &apos;t gonna let you go .
standing up to that monster proved one thing --
if anyone &apos;s gonna save this town , it &apos;s you .
uh @-@ oh , here &apos;s another one .
you know granny will give you a glass
if you ask .
you tried to kiss her ?
aye .
she didn &apos;t even flinch .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not over .
i spent over a century trying to find a way
to kill the bloody crocodile .
i can spend at least that long
trying to save the woman i love .
yeah .
what is this ?
is it magic ?
sort of .
we call it a jukebox .
if you feed it ,
it will sing for you .
right .
you &apos;re not from here .
our music takes some getting used to .
no , it &apos;s ...
i -- i feel like i &apos;ve heard this before .
i &apos;m violet .
henry . hi .
mary margaret ?
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re gonna get emma back ,
and we &apos;re gonna win this fight .
i know .
you &apos;re forgetting one thing , david .
if we win ...
emma loses .
i hope you &apos;ll accept my apology .
we don &apos;t normally try and kill our guests in camelot .
percival &apos;s actions were inexcusable .
but he was right .
i am the evil queen .
camelot is a place of second chances .
who you were doesn &apos;t matter ,
just who you are .
and if you were able to save him with your magic ,
then you really are the savior merlin prophesied .
thank you .
these strangers frighten me , arthur .
you know merlin &apos;s prophecy as well as i do .
they &apos;re meant to be here .
merlin tells us what happens , but he doesn &apos;t tell us how .
percival ...
is dead .
who knows what other trouble they &apos;ll bring ?
they &apos;re here to destroy the dark one .
that won &apos;t be easy .
but helping them may be the only way
i &apos;ll ever get my hands on that monster &apos;s dagger .
guinevere , if i don &apos;t make excalibur whole again ,
we &apos;ll lose everything we worked so hard to build .
what &apos;s the matter , dearie ?
feeling left out ?
what are you doing here ?
i already embraced the darkness .
you did , but i &apos;m back
because there &apos;s more work to be done --
something bigger than both of us .
as long as the dark ones existed ,
one thing has always held us back .
the pull of the family we were so desperate to protect .
the friendships that make it impossible to forget who we used to be .
the magic that threatens to undo our most evil deeds .
and , worst of all ...
the love that refuses to give up on us .
you see , no matter how hard we try ,
we can &apos;t escape the reach of the light .
but , emma swan , you can change that .
that &apos;s why you brought that sword here .
you can do what no dark one before you has ever done .
you can make that weapon whole again
and use it to snuff out the light ...
forever .
did you really think it would be that simple , dearie ?
if you want that sword , you &apos;re gonna have to pay
the price .
