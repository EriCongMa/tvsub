what &apos;s up , good lookin &apos; ?
idiot .
you wanna kill somebody ? it ain &apos;t gonna be us .
hey , callie .
do you forgive me ?
you were hands down the best juliet .
would you be in my musical ?
you canceled the check ?
the one you stole from me ? you bet i did .
i hate you , and daddy hated you too ,
and that &apos;s why he killed himself .
we got all the plants and materials donated ...
thanks to monte !
so have you read it , the bill ?
no .
i just don &apos;t like seeing kids being sold to the highest bidder .
and let &apos;s be honest , rita , you have your own agenda .
that &apos;s what you think of me ?
i &apos;m kind of worried about jesus .
he found our birth dad .
the guy &apos;s a sex offender .
he &apos;s on that list because of me .
i was 15 , he was 18 .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for .
i &apos;m not your father and i never will be .
mariana , watch it please !
sorry , mom .
emotional intelligence . what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the ability to express your emotions in a positive way .
your eq instead of your iq .
so you &apos;re , like , taking a class ?
no , i &apos;m teaching a class
as part of the department &apos;s youth outreach program .
no offense , but who would want to take a class like this ?
kids who have a choice between it and juvie , that &apos;s who .
&quot; what is an appropriate response to anger ?
&apos;a &apos; , beat someone up , &apos; b &apos; , start a fire ,
&apos;c &apos; , get drunk ,
&apos;d &apos; , express your feelings with words ? &quot; seriously ?
for this kids that i am teaching
who don &apos;t have good parenting or a stable home ,
&apos;d &apos; is not necessarily the obvious choice , mariana .
hey , check it out .
oh , my gosh .
wow ! i love it !
wow , brandon .
that is amazing .
yeah , mat designed it .
hm . well , it must have been hard
with zoey &apos;s tongue down his throat .
mat &apos;s dating zoey ?
yeah , and i find it very unprofessional if you ask me ,
but the director totally rejected
the idea of a no dating policy , so ...
oh , please .
you just don &apos;t want to see mat with anyone else
even though you &apos;re dating that nick guy or whatever .
i am not .
i went on one date with him and it was a total disaster .
why ? what happened ?
nothing . it was just boring .
uh , well , brandon ,
i think that poster is absolutely beautiful .
i &apos;m very proud of you ,
how hard you &apos;ve been working on your senior project .
yeah , i guess i didn &apos;t realize
how much time it would take exactly .
well , what about your juilliard audition ?
you know , don &apos;t drop the ball on that please .
oh , no . i ... i won &apos;t . um , i ... i &apos;ve got time .
mom , i actually ... i wanted to ask you , um ,
do you think we could rehearse on the gym stage ?
it &apos;s just that the art room is getting a little small
now that we &apos;re casting the other parts .
i &apos;ll talk to monte ,
but i don &apos;t see why not .
all right .
okay , everybody . come on . let &apos;s get a move on .
jesus , you gonna put some clothes on sometime today ?
i don &apos;t have a first period today .
my teacher &apos;s at a conference .
what kind of school you runnin &apos; over there ?
oh , and hey , and listen , mike is out of town for a little bit ,
so a.j. &apos; s gonna stay with us .
for how long ?
just a couple of days .
jude doesn &apos;t get back from his school trip until friday ,
so he can sleep in his bed .
great , i finally get the room to myself ,
and now i gotta share it again ?
you know what ?
may i have your b ... b ...
thank you , callie .
so , uh , there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
something you should know .
um , a.j. and i are kind of dating .
oh . sorry . i ... i forgot my poster .
uh ... okay .
well , we &apos;re not fostering him ,
so i guess there &apos;s not an illegal issue if he stays here .
but as with any boyfriend in the house ,
we expect you to follow the rules .
you know , no hanging out behind closed doors .
oh , of course not .
thank you for telling us .
is anyone home ?
hey , i was gonna talk to you about a.j.
oh , yeah ? when ?
when we &apos;re sure we know what we &apos;re doing .
it ... it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s whatever .
i mean , technically there &apos;s something i haven &apos;t told you either , so ...
what ?
um ... i &apos;m seeing someone .
do i know her ?
no .
she &apos;s older .
older ? okay .
just a little .
she &apos;s just not in high school .
still mad at me ?
still an idiot ?
go out with me again .
no .
why not ?
because you &apos;re a douche and you could have killed us !
you were driving like a maniac .
i was in total control of the car !
no one &apos;s in control when they &apos;re speeding
and weaving in and out of traffic .
that guy was hitting on you .
what was i supposed to do ?
nothing !
you were supposed to do nothing !
you know what your problem is ?
you have no emotional intelligence .
what does that mean ?
exactly .
we could use the community outreach money .
we &apos;ve got that leftover
since sally got all the materials donated .
yes , since sally got everything donated .
how &apos;s that going anyway ?
oh . um , i think everything &apos;s a go to start planting this weekend .
great .
but i &apos;m keeping my distance
so there won &apos;t be any perception of impropriety .
speaking of senior projects , brandon wanted to know
if he could use the gym space for rehearsal .
would that be okay ?
yeah , of course .
but ...
what ?
i was gonna wait to talk to you about this
till i had a little more information ,
but we might have a problem .
some students have expressed concerns about the play itself .
romeo and juliet ?
yeah .
they don &apos;t think it &apos;s appropriate .
yep .
calculus ?
do you really understand this stuff ?
most of it , yeah .
really ?
why do you sound surprised ?
nothing . it &apos;s ... you &apos;re just an artist .
i thought art and math were , like , mutually exclusive .
not at all , not at all . look .
have a seat , missy .
look at this .
drawing is kind of mathematical
when you break it down .
see ? it &apos;s all geometry and perspective .
and then there &apos;s this thing called the golden ratio .
that just helps out with proportion .
very cool .
yeah .
you are not just a work of art , callie ,
you are a mathematical equation which i have yet to solve .
seriously , that was , like ,
the worst line i &apos;ve ever heard .
was it ?
yeah !
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll be in the garage .
so look , i told my moms that we &apos;re ...
you know , whatever we are just so ... you know ,
it wasn &apos;t like we were ...
like , hiding something from them .
not that there &apos;s anything to hide .
what ?
nothing .
i &apos;m just glad you thought whatever we are
is worth talking to your moms about .
inappropriate ?
how is r &amp; j inappropriate ?
some students feel like it could be a trigger for teen suicide ,
and we have to be sensitive to that .
a trigger ? really ? are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s shakespeare !
i mean , it &apos;s not like he &apos;s endorsing suicide .
it &apos;s called tragedy for a reason !
i agree and i &apos;m gonna fight it .
good !
i mean , you realize this is my senior project .
like , if this doesn &apos;t happen , i can &apos;t graduate !
i know . i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
i just wanted you to know what &apos;s going on .
i mean , who is it ? who are these students ?
brandon , you know i can &apos;t tell you that .
listen . listen to me .
i don &apos;t want you taking matters into your own hands ,
all right ?
let me handle it .
so the purpose of this exercise
is to use the letters of your name and write
something that you think is a positive trait about yourself .
so , the first letter in my name is &apos; s &apos; ,
so i &apos;m gonna write &quot; strong . &quot; i &apos;m strong .
the second letter is a &apos; t &apos; .
anyone think of a positive trait
that we could use starting with the letter &apos; t &apos; ?
&quot; tits . &quot;
what ? you got great tits .
that &apos;s a positive trait .
&quot; tenacious . &quot;
i &apos;m tenacious ...
empathetic ...
and fierce .
okay , so that &apos;s me .
what are you ?
hell , i &apos;m fierce .
yeah ?
i wish i had an &apos; f &apos; in my name .
let &apos;s see , you got a &apos; p &apos; . got a &apos; p &apos; in your name .
how about &quot; powerful &quot; ? you &apos;re powerful .
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah , i &apos;m powerful .
all right , you &apos;re powerful .
what &apos;s this crap ?
excuse me ?
you &apos;re being disruptive .
i need you to sit down please .
the other popo who taught the class brought donuts .
really ?
where &apos;s the donuts ?
yeah . where &apos;s the chips ?
and what the hell is this right here ?
&quot; hummus &quot; ?
it looks like diarrhea .
smells like it too .
okay , your behavior right now is inappropriate .
i would like you to go and sit down .
uh , i &apos;m telling you how i feel .
i mean , isn &apos;t that what this whole class is all about ?
that &apos;s true .
yeah . okay .
sure .
can you identify the emotion that you &apos;re feeling right now then ?
yeah . i &apos;m mad .
okay , great . so , when you &apos;re disappointed ,
you get mad . is that fair to say ?
okay , then so what would
be an appropriate response to this situation ?
okay , get out .
the judge ordered me to be here .
you can &apos;t just kick me out .
try me .
okay , lady .
but this one &apos;s on you .
okay .
ooh , can we go too ?
absolutely . if you &apos;d rather be in juvie than here , feel free .
anybody else want to join him ?
if schools start putting trigger warnings
on every book or play that could be upsetting to someone ,
how are we supposed to learn to think for ourselves ?
i &apos;m sure mom &apos;s not gonna let them kill r &amp; j.
well , she better not .
another portrait ?
someone &apos;s in love .
we are not in love .
maybe you aren &apos;t .
so tell me , is it weird knowing
that a.j. &apos; s sleeping in the next room ?
um , no .
in his boxers ...
seriously !
do you think you can resist sneaking into his room later ?
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll find a way .
nick &apos;s , like , stalking me all of a sudden .
really ?
oh , my god !
now he &apos;s outside !
do i have to get a restraining order ?
you know my mom &apos;s a cop .
yeah ,
which is why i &apos;ve been trying to call you .
he &apos;s pretty loaded .
you got him drunk ?
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i ...
just don &apos;t . just ... just go .
get out of here before i do go get my mom .
okay , how the hell are we gonna get him upstairs ?
so how &apos;d it go ?
fine .
but i think you &apos;re right .
i think taking on extra work right now
is just a little too much for me .
well , did something happen ?
no , no .
but if you don &apos;t mind , i think , um ...
i think i &apos;m gonna ask if they could find
another officer to replace me .
of course i don &apos;t mind .
yeah , come in .
do you have a second to talk ?
sure .
okay , good ,
because i need your advice on something .
okay . what is it ?
it &apos;s about ...
do you remember when i dyed my hair blond ?
what the hell are you feeding this guy ?
i know .
what was that ?
can you please stay focused ?
i mean , y ... you ask us to talk to you ,
and then you just get all distracted and ...
you know , there &apos;s been so many famous blond juliets .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna put you in the bed right now .
you ready ?
okay . okay .
all right .
i should turn him on his side
just in case he pukes .
here .
here &apos;s a trash can .
thank you for doing this .
i know you could get in trouble .
yeah , we all could .
goodnight .
i guess romeo doesn &apos;t really care
if juliet &apos;s a blond or a brunette .
hey . uh , i just wanted to say goodnight .
goodnight , sweetheart .
goodnight , love .
okay , well , um ...
i think i &apos;m just gonna stay a brunette juliet .
thanks for the advice .
that was close .
hey , callie . this is chloe , rita &apos;s daughter .
my mom changed her number again .
she won &apos;t take my calls , so ...
can you tell her goodbye for me ...
that i forgive her ,
and i &apos;m sorry ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s gonna happen to me ,
but maybe we &apos;d both be better off
if i wasn &apos;t around anymore .
since when do you knock ?
no , i know . i just , um , i didn &apos;t want to barge in ,
but you never got back to me about chloe .
i texted you .
yeah , but did you call her back ?
no , i didn &apos;t call her ,
but i &apos;m sure she &apos;s fine .
i mean , as fine as she can be .
how do you know that ?
sounded like she really might hurt herself or something .
do you want to come in ?
the first time i got a message like that from chloe ,
i dropped everything and ran to wherever it was
that she was living at the time ,
and after a very convincing performance , she swore
that she would get help and go back on her meds
if i wrote her a check ,
which i did .
and then i fell for it again ,
and then the next time , and the time after that ,
but finally i got it .
i was not helping my daughter .
i was actually enabling her
to continue her destructive behavior .
well , maybe this time &apos;s different .
no , it &apos;s not .
when chloe &apos;s on her meds , she starts feeling better .
when she starts feeling better , she decides to stop her meds .
and when she stops her meds , she doesn &apos;t realize
just how sick she actually is .
i &apos;m really sorry for the position she put you in ,
having you reach out to me .
but trust me ,
she is not going to kill herself ,
and nothing is gonna change until she changes .
can &apos;t you just talk to her without giving her money ?
i have tried .
so what ? you just stop trying ?
she &apos;s your daughter .
aren &apos;t ... aren &apos;t you supposed
to take every suicide threat seriously ?
look , callie ,
i really don &apos;t expect you to understand .
i know .
because you &apos;re the only one who &apos;s ever right .
you know , maybe you &apos;re the one that needs to change .
maybe if you listened instead of always telling
everybody they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about ...
is this about me and my daughter or is this about me and you ?
does it matter ?
it is always your way or the highway .
look , callie , i know you don &apos;t want to hear this right now ,
but you are on the wrong side of this foster reform bill .
this is not reform at all .
it is business as usual .
in fact , you know what ? it &apos;s actually worse .
i didn &apos;t come to argue this again .
why did you come here ?
because i thought that since chloe &apos;s dad killed himself
that maybe you wouldn &apos;t want to take any chances .
so you &apos;re the one behind this .
not just me . a lot of students feel that way .
yeah ? well , this is what i think of your petition .
no one &apos;s saying suicide is sexy .
teen suicide is a real problem , brandon .
a big one !
god , and you &apos;re glamorizing it by staging your play !
it &apos;s not my play ! it &apos;s shakespeare &apos;s !
and it &apos;s done in more schools than any other play in history !
that doesn &apos;t make it right !
last summer , my best friend &apos;s sister hung herself
after her boyfriend broke up with her .
suicide is a real tragedy , brandon .
not just some dumb way to end a play .
and don &apos;t think this is over
just &apos; cause you ripped up a piece of paper , okay ?
there &apos;s a lot more where that came from .
ugh , you still smell like a frat house .
you know , don &apos;t judge . you &apos;ve been drunk before .
yeah , at a party .
not by myself on a monday .
what the hell are you doing ?
you know what ?
leave me alone .
all right . later .
jesus told me that you weren &apos;t drinking with him ,
that he just called you to get a ride home , so ...
i &apos;m sorry i bit your head off .
i &apos;m not gonna lie , i was upset at first ,
but i was able to stay present and factor my emotional memory
into my decision making process , at which point i realized
my being defensive was why
you refused to forgive me to other night .
but what i should have done was apologize for scaring you
by driving too fast , beg your forgiveness ...
and ask for another chance .
huh ?
i looked up &quot; emotional intelligence . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to positively resolve this conflict
with the use of humor and accountability .
so ...
now that i &apos;ve raised my eq ...
how about another date ?
brandon , i asked you to let me handle this .
you can &apos;t just rip a petition off the wall
because you don &apos;t agree with it .
no , but they can shut down my play
if they don &apos;t agree with it ?
no one &apos;s shutting your play down .
i expect you to apologize to sally benton .
all right .
good .
thank you .
i have to say i understand brandon &apos;s frustration .
he &apos;s worked so hard on this . he &apos;s invested so much .
this is his senior project and now he can &apos;t put it on
because a few kids object ?
don &apos;t you think that &apos;s a bit extreme ?
maybe , but i think we have to let
the students decide this one .
sally and brandon can make their cases to the honor board .
who is it ?
it &apos;s callie .
i really appreciate you coming .
of course .
i wish i had something to offer you ,
but things are kind of tight .
no , i don &apos;t need anything .
i just wanted to make sure that you &apos;re okay .
you know , your message got me really worried .
um ... just having a hard time .
i mean , obviously . look where i &apos;m living .
and who knows how long i can even afford this dump
now that i lost my job .
wait , you ...
yeah , i got let go for no reason .
they said downsizing , but honestly ,
my boss didn &apos;t like me because , you know ,
i was smarter than her
and she felt threatened .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m trying to get severance pay , but she &apos;s saying i quit ,
which means i can &apos;t get unemployment ,
so i &apos;m totally screwed .
i could end up on the street .
and now my eczema &apos;s flaring up .
i can &apos;t even afford my medicine .
look , i feel really bad .
i ju ... i don &apos;t know what i can do .
did you talk to my mom ?
yeah .
did she care ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure she cares . i think she &apos;s just ...
cold selfish bitch .
no , i think it &apos;s just hard for her .
you know , she &apos;s said that you &apos;ve left messages like this before .
she &apos;s a liar .
how could i leave her a message
if i don &apos;t even have her number ?
if i call girls united , she refuses to talk to me .
i mean , what kind of mom won &apos;t even talk to her daughter ?
she could care less if i ended up on the street .
or dead .
are you ...
are you planning on hurting yourself ?
no . i &apos;m just ...
i need someone to help me .
i ... i have this friend with an apartment
and she &apos;ll rent me a room .
i just need to come up with first and last .
$ 600 ...
which isn &apos;t a lot of money to my mother .
do you think maybe you could , like ...
loan me some money ?
i mean , anything would help , and i &apos;ll pay you back . i swear .
tough day at work ?
i know it &apos;s a school night , but i think , uh ,
i think we deserve a cocktail .
well , i &apos;m not gonna say no to that .
good , because riding a desk is killing me .
how was you day , my love ?
oh , make it a double please .
oh , trust me , it already is .
cheers .
cheers .
this tastes like ...
it &apos;s been watered down .
it &apos;s been watered down .
you don &apos;t think that one ...
oh , my god ,
the kids are watering down the vodka .
should we get them together ?
oh , no , no . i &apos;m a cop . i &apos;m gonna dust for prints .
honey , you &apos;re not serious .
i &apos;m totally serious
because i was looking forward to this drink .
maybe it was your mom .
you know how she likes her cocktails .
maybe she didn &apos;t want you to know how much she was drinking .
wait , you think my mother was sneaking liquor ?
that &apos;s weird .
that &apos;s a good point . maybe it was my mother .
i &apos;ll get it .
hey , i &apos;m gabe .
he showed up at my worksite like this .
what ?
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s ... he &apos;s in bed .
i can get into a lot of trouble doing what i just did
just for taking him home .
yes . we , uh , we know
that you &apos;re on the sex offenders list .
but we know why .
i didn &apos;t know who jesus was .
all right ? he lied to me , he lied to my boss .
he said he was 18 .
all right ? when he finally told me who he was ,
i told him to leave
and don &apos;t come back .
but obviously , that didn &apos;t stop him .
if he keeps showing up at the site like this ,
i &apos;m gonna have to find another job ,
and this one was hard enough for me to get .
we &apos;re very sorry .
um , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sure it &apos;s tough .
i made a mistake being with ana .
i know that .
she was 15 , i was 18,
i was dealing drugs ,
made some really bad decisions .
but we really did think that we were in love .
and i went to jail and i did my time .
all right ? but this list ...
it &apos;s a life sentence .
i &apos;m not some creep who goes around and messes with kids .
all right ? i have been out 10 years , and i haven &apos;t gotten
into any trouble ,
so you have got to keep your son away from me .
please .
absolutely .
we promise that we &apos;ll take care of it .
thank you so much for bringing him home .
this is ... this is gabe .
you have a problem , jesus ?
i &apos;m serious . do you need to go to aa ?
no .
okay , because sneaking vodka and watering down the bottle
is alcoholic behavior to me .
i &apos;m pretty concerned about you , young man .
just the ... the way you &apos;ve been acting .
going behind our backs to find your birth father ?
going to his worksite three times
even though he told you to stay away ?
okay !
no , not okay !
not only are you putting yourself in jeopardy ,
you &apos;re putting gabe in a position where he could be arrested
and you &apos;re putting me in a really bad spot
because guess what ?
i &apos;m a cop .
whether gabe deserves to be on that sex offenders list
is another issue , but the law is quite clear .
you are a minor and he cannot be anywhere near you .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i ... i get it . i &apos;m not gonna do it again .
i don &apos;t think you do get it .
your birth father doesn &apos;t want a relationship with you
or with your sister , okay ?
and that sucks , but that &apos;s the way it is .
life &apos;s a bitch sometimes .
and on that note , you &apos;re grounded indefinitely .
mom &apos;s been through a lot lately .
i know you know that .
but she &apos;s right . you need to stay away from gabe
and you need to shape up .
he &apos;s tall .
like you .
okay , everybody .
first thing , mariana and i will be recusing ourselves from voting
since she &apos;s in the play
and i am making the arguments against r &amp; j.
now , let &apos;s get started .
suicide is the second leading cause of death
for 15 to 25 @-@ year @-@ olds .
why ?
because young adults experience strong , intense feelings
of stress , of self @-@ doubt , of loneliness , of loss ,
of the pressure to succeed .
in romeo and juliet , shakespeare romanticizes
suicide as a way for two teenagers in love
to be together forever in eternity .
romeo toasts , &quot; here &apos;s to my love , &quot;
as he drinks the poison that kills him .
the poison that juliet calls &quot; friendly drops &quot;
when she tries to kiss them off his lips ,
but instead uses a &quot; happy dagger &quot; to end her life .
how is this idealization of love and death
a good message to send teenagers ?
thank you . brandon ?
forbidding the performance of a classic piece of literature
because it might in and of itself
trigger someone to kill themself is not only ridiculous ,
but it &apos;s one small step away from banning books .
and let &apos;s talk about this idea that shakespeare &apos;s romanticizing
suicide in romeo and juliet .
he &apos;s not even romanticizing their relationship .
i used to think that r &amp; j was about true love .
it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s about two rebellious ,
impulsive teenagers making really bad choices .
and ... and this suicide pact at the end , it ...
it &apos;s not portrayed as this ultimate act of true love .
it &apos;s portrayed as a tragic act
taken by two screwed up kids
who dismiss the value of their lives .
which is why the last line in the play isn &apos;t ,
&quot; they killed themselves and lived happily ever after . &quot;
no .
it &apos;s , &quot; for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo . &quot;
okay , so we &apos;ve heard both sides
and it &apos;s time for the honor board to vote .
those in favor of staging romeo and juliet ,
raise your hands .
okay . and against ?
brandon , i am so sorry .
i know how hard you worked .
um , okay , uh ... what if we do it somewhere else ?
off campus .
they can &apos;t stop us from doing that , can they ?
no .
and can it still count as our senior project ?
well , other students are doing their projects off campus ,
so yeah , it definitely could .
okay .
but where ?
well , we need a theater or a big space ,
but we don &apos;t have the money to rent something like that .
plus , without all the lights and the soundboard
we have here at school , well , it &apos;s , like ...
impossible .
brandon , i am so sorry .
thanks , mom .
hey , mat , wait up .
hey , i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , me too .
so you still want to hang out ?
um ... not really in the mood .
well , let me try to cheer you up .
i don &apos;t see why i have to go to some class for losers !
because you &apos;ve been acting like one , that &apos;s why .
this is so unfair !
no , it &apos;s not !
listen , i understand that you &apos;re disappointed and upset
about flintwood and wrestling and your birth father ,
but do you know what ?
you have not been responding appropriately .
this is bull .
no , it &apos;s tough love !
you know what ? go get ready before i kick your ass ,
and don &apos;t think that i won &apos;t .
what is going on ?
they have not been able to find a replacement teacher for me ,
so i &apos;m taking our little hoodlum with me to class tonight
so that he can see what his future is
if he doesn &apos;t straighten himself out .
okay , i wasn &apos;t gonna say anything ,
but you are being way too hard on him .
telling him that his birth father
doesn &apos;t want anything to do with him ?
telling him that life &apos;s a bitch ?
yeah , well , that &apos;s reality .
his or yours ?
i realize you &apos;re having a rough time with the mastectomy ,
with having to ride a desk at work ,
but jesus is not the only one who &apos;s not responding appropriately .
and that &apos;s not coming from a critical place .
it &apos;s coming from a place of tough love .
it &apos;s one of my dad &apos;s warehouses .
what are we doing here ?
teaching you to hoverboard .
hm , okay .
you ever , uh , ride one of these things ?
please .
what ? okay . okay .
damn , girl .
well , maybe you can teach me how to hoverboard then .
how &apos;s that ?
hey , check out the acoustics .
hello !
hey , you should sing something .
from your play .
from r &amp; j ?
for real . i wanna hear you sing .
nuh @-@ uh .
uh @-@ huh .
nuh @-@ uh .
uh @-@ huh .
okay .
♪ this love could be great ♪
♪ but they say it would be wrong ♪
♪ i don &apos;t care ♪
♪ &apos; cause i &apos;d be lost ♪
♪ without you ♪
what if ...
you do the whole play here ?
are you serious ?
i mean , i know my dad will say yes .
it &apos;s one of the perks of being , uh , kind of spoiled .
oh , my god , you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re totally my hero !
callie ?
callie , are you there ?
this is chloe .
i did something bad .
say goodbye for me .
emotional intelligence is a wide range of skills
&quot; that young people can develop and improve . &quot;
&quot; these skills are critical
for emotional well @-@ being and success in life . &quot;
the thing is that , uh ,
emotional intelligence isn &apos;t something that , uh ,
just young people need to work on ,
just you need to work on .
everyone , myself included ,
needs to figure out a way to identify what we &apos;re feeling
so we know what to do with it .
i had something really bad happen to me ,
and i have been angry
and keeping it inside . i ...
i had cancer and i had to have both of my breasts removed .
these are just pads .
and so , javier , when you threw away the hummus ...
i overreacted by throwing you out .
so ...
i know that all of you have had something bad happen to you ...
and you &apos;ve been hurt , disappointed , and angry ,
and you probably haven &apos;t reacted in the smartest of ways .
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re all here .
all of us .
to help each other
become more self @-@ aware ,
and learn to express ourselves in healthier ways .
so , when javier suggested that i write &quot; tits &quot; on the board
as one of my positive attributes ,
how could i have reacted better ?
with humor .
absolutely .
i could have made a joke .
you could have told me i hurt your feelings .
i could have .
thank you , javier .
i never thought she &apos;d actually do it .
i know .
you were right , cal , you know .
i should &apos;ve listened to you .
i ... i should have taken her threats more seriously .
no , i get why you didn &apos;t .
after hearing her cry wolf so many times ...
i &apos;m really sorry that you were involved in all this .
really , i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry for what i said to you .
thank god she &apos;s gonna be okay .
i ... i don &apos;t think she really wanted to kill herself .
i mean , she called me .
you know , she must have figured
that i would get the message sooner
and send someone to save her , you know ?
for the first time in my life ,
when i walked into that hospital room ,
when she said she wanted help ...
when she said she needed me ...
she meant it .
maybe she was trying to get my attention , but i think ...
i think this time , she got her own attention .
so now ...
now we &apos;re gonna go to counseling
to try to figure out what the hell to do
with all these awful , messy feelings , you know ?
i think ...
i hope ...
that this is the moment
where it all starts to change for her .
thank you .
listen , i know that i &apos;m stubborn .
i know that i &apos;m really opinionated , and so are you .
and hey , about that foster care bill ,
listen , we &apos;re gonna have to agree to disagree .
but know , know that even when i disagree with you , callie ,
i am so proud
of the amazing young woman that you &apos;re becoming .
i heard about what happened .
do you want to talk about it ?
that &apos;s cool .
do you mind if i just sit there with you ?
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re doing it off campus .
and you don &apos;t have to come .
hey , uh , can i talk to you ?
come in .
what is it , sally ? what happened ?
i ...
sorry , i &apos;m ...
i don &apos;t know how , um ...
it &apos;s really hard for me to say this .
monte kissed me .
