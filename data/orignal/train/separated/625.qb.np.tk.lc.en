第一季 第六集
daddy !
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
amanda !
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died , he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives .
lydia davis ...
is on to you .
how could you know all of this ?
i @-@ i might have bugged your house .
i came to apologize .
for sleeping with my husband or for blackmailing us ?
just hoping to find a really good reason to stick around .
why would you lie to me about emily canceling our date ?
i was just trying to help .
don &apos;t .
aaah ! help !
emily , where the hell are you ?
i think frank just killed lydia .
they say vengeance taken will tear the heart
and torment the conscience .
if there &apos;s any truth to it ,
then i now know with certainty
that the path i &apos;m on is the right one .
hi .
how is it possible for you to wake up looking this good ?
it isn &apos;t . you &apos;re just half asleep .
come here . i like this dream .
don &apos;t answer it . they &apos;ll go away .
hold that thought .
what the hell are you doing ?
what the hell are you doing ?
don &apos;t you check your voice mail ?
why , what happened ?
lydia &apos;s in a coma .
the graysons &apos; security guy
threw her off her balcony last night .
oh , my god .
will you let me in ? i &apos;ve got the whole thing on video .
daniel &apos;s upstairs .
bravo .
get rid of him .
hey . look who finally closed the girl next door ?
how was she ?
fine . be that way .
what are you getting all suited up for ?
it &apos;s 4th of july weekend .
uh , your dad &apos;s working from the home office today ,
and i offered my services over breakfast .
regular employee of the month .
well , since you decided to bail on the internship ,
i &apos;m dealing with twice the pressure .
oh , something tells me , you &apos;ll do just fine .
thanks .
but don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s not all work and no play .
i &apos;ve got an epic weekend planned for us .
axe lounge tomorrow , after party at south pointe ,
surf lodge tonight , which will be great--
i can &apos;t tonight .
got plans with emily .
dude , you &apos;ve already got her on the hook .
you need to let the line out a little bit .
i mean , if you hang out with her two nights in a row ,
she &apos;s gonna start to think it &apos;s serious .
good . that &apos;s the idea .
it was all you--
destroying senator kingsly ,
dr. banks , bill harmon .
you really take that woman- scorned thing seriously ...
what are you talking about ? don &apos;t you ?
get out .
help ! somebody help !
that thud you hear is the sound of lydia
hitting the roof of the taxi five stories down .
i can &apos;t believe she survived .
i can &apos;t believe i survived .
victoria , it &apos;s frank . i have some bad news to report .
lydia davis just jumped off her balcony .
call me when you get this .
you know , if i &apos;d shown up one minute earlier ,
that psychopath woulda caught me .
yeah , but he didn &apos;t ,
and you made it out with the list and the video camera .
and this .
we got lucky .
you might want to revisit your definition of &quot; lucky &quot;
in the dictionary .
lydia might die because of us .
if lydia dies ,
it &apos;s because she sold her soul to the graysons .
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
i didn &apos;t set any of this in motion . they did .
fine .
let &apos;s say she survives ,
wakes up tomorrow , remembering only one thing--
this picture .
eventually , someone &apos;s gonna find you out .
not if they believe it &apos;s all been frank .
as far as the graysons know ...
lydia attempted suicide .
when they see this video ,
they &apos;ll know that frank lied to them .
let &apos;s send a copy to the police .
no police .
frank dug his own grave .
all we need
is for victoria and conrad to bury him in it .
you still have 15 invitees listed as maybes .
i &apos;ll e @-@ mail reminders out today .
oh , well , this 4th of july party
is a hampton tradition for 20 years .
anyone who needs reminding shouldn &apos;t come .
okay .
i thought we might set the dessert buffet
here in the conservatory rather than out on the lawn .
it can get quite buggy .
fine .
how would you like to acknowledge lydia &apos;s absence ?
maybe an open seat at your table in a show of support ?
let &apos;s send her a supportive bouquet of flowers
to the hospital .
that should suffice .
i have some errands to run . carry on .
okay .
morning , beautiful .
how &apos;s the dragon lady , today ?
she &apos;s not quite herself today , i &apos;m afraid .
hmm ? well , that should be a good thing , right ?
mm . theoretically , under the right set of circumstances ,
but these are definitely not them .
how &apos;s dinner at east hampton point sound ?
like today can &apos;t be over soon enough .
then it &apos;s a date .
damn it .
what ?
i @-@ i promised daniel that we &apos;d hang out tonight .
he wants to talk about the troubles with his dad .
i ... i &apos;d hate to see him fall off the wagon again .
well , far be it from me to stand in the way of that .
emily should be free . i &apos;ll just give her a call .
oh , wait . why--why don &apos;t we just make it a double date ?
what do you think ?
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
great . you work it out with the princess .
i &apos;ll talk to daniel and make a reservation for four .
what &apos;s up , dec ?
skipper ?
we &apos;re not open yet .
you &apos;d think he &apos;d have our hours of operation down by now , right ?
can &apos;t a guy hang with his broheim ?
no , and don &apos;t ever call me that .
so ...
what &apos;s the haps with you and ems ?
sounds like danny boy is starting to pull ahead .
there &apos;s no haps .
i &apos;m just not her type .
you &apos;re everyone &apos;s type .
what ? you can &apos;t wait for this girl to come to you .
trust me . i know her .
you are now competing for an elite piece of hampton &apos;s tail ,
and with a grayson , no less .
yeah , a grayson who he just hired to work here .
don &apos;t ask about that .
i &apos;m not sure how it happened myself .
it happened because your inner gladiator &apos;s finally waking up .
poor little rich boy ,
rebelling against the pressures of having it all .
and deep down , you know that you can turn
this fortuitous power shift to your advantage ,
and emily will be yours .
you &apos;re a mental case . you know that ?
he also happens to be right .
come on , guys like us want girls like that ,
we gotta fight a little bit harder .
unless ...
you don &apos;t really think she &apos;s worth it .
now that &apos;s plain witchy .
hello .
did you send it ?
not yet . the file &apos;s being encrypted with a cast @-@ 128 algorithm ,
which takes time .
this is brave new territory we &apos;re venturing into here .
absolutely sure this is how you want to handle it ?
i &apos;m sure .
pull the trigger .
all right .
社交名媛跳楼自杀
it was all you--
destroying senator kingsly ,
dr. banks ...
get out .
help ! somebody help !
dear god .
that needs to go in the pool house , please .
uh , we just need to put the lanterns over the patio door .
that needs to go straight . straight . just-- yeah , straight .
ashley , this looks fantastic .
very festive .
thanks , although , i have to admit ,
it is slightly humiliating , having to plan a party
celebrating the defeat of england .
i don &apos;t do well with rejection .
obviously .
that was over 200 years ago .
is daniel in the back ?
no . he and tyler went to grab some lunch .
hey , i don &apos;t know if you have plans tonight ,
but tyler thought it might be fun if we all went on a double date .
isn &apos;t that sweet ?
yeah , so sweet . um ...
but , you know , things are very new with daniel ,
and we &apos;re still kinda getting to know each other .
that &apos;s kind of hard to do with tyler around .
oh , my god . you hate him .
no , i don &apos;t hate him .
i just ...
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know him very well .
well , why not get to know him ?
this is really important to you , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , it is .
i wouldn &apos;t be asking if it wasn &apos;t .
i really like him , emily ,
and he is daniel &apos;s best friend .
give him a chance .
you &apos;re right . count us in .
super .
what are you , uh ,
what are you doing here ?
your text said you wanted to talk ?
yeah , but , i , uh ...
i was gonna come to you .
so did you or didn &apos;t you want to talk ?
okay , yeah . uh , here is fine .
can we , uh ...
all right .
so far ,
i &apos;ve tried taking you sailing without a boat ,
gotten my face bashed in by your ex ,
and been arrested .
so you don &apos;t want to continue this crime spree with me ?
no , what i--what i want
is to take you out on a real date .
okay . yeah , great .
you said great ?
you wanted a different answer ?
no , no . uh , how about this weekend ?
sure .
oh , but my parents throw this big party every year for the 4th ,
and i kind of have to be there .
you should come .
to your parents &apos; party ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but i--i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna hold you to our date .
okay .
hey , frank .
have a seat .
water .
we &apos;ve been through a lot together .
we certainly have .
too much , i think .
i think the time has come for us to go our separate ways .
are you firing me ?
no . firing is not the word i &apos;d use .
after 20 years of service ,
what word would you use ?
okay .
all right . you want to hear the truth ?
for whatever reason , you &apos;ve chosen to show
a deeper loyalty to my wife than to me .
what are you talking about ?
oh , come on . there &apos;s only one way
victoria could &apos;ve found out about the check i wrote to lydia
from the cayman account ,
and that was from you .
now exactly why you chose to breach my trust ,
i can only speculate .
but the net result is the same .
no matter how you do the math , frank .
i can &apos;t trust you anymore .
you can &apos;t trust me ?
you wouldn &apos;t be sitting here if it wasn &apos;t for me ?
you &apos;d be in a federal prison , rotting ...
and david clarke would still be alive .
yeah , which is why i wrote a second check in your name .
now i think you &apos;ll see that it reflects my deepest loyalty
and appreciation for what you &apos;ve done .
my jet &apos;s all fueled up ,
ready to take you anywhere you want to go .
i suggest you go someplace very far away from here .
jack , hi .
what are you doing here ?
i can &apos;t let this go on any longer .
that porch swing has been neglected for long enough .
that &apos;s really sweet of you .
well , i feel obligated .
&apos;cause i was one of the first people to swing on it .
when i was a kid , i knew the family that lived here .
it was a little girl and her dad .
he always wanted to move it over to that corner
so it would face the sunrise .
that would make a lot of sense .
well , he never got around to it , so ...
evening , all .
hey , boss .
grayson .
jack came by to fix the porch swing .
nice .
wow . who knew you were a triple threat--
bartender , captain , and handyman ?
uh , daniel and i are going for dinner .
i &apos;m gonna grab my purse .
okay .
looking forward to starting work .
yeah ? i wasn &apos;t sure
you were serious about the job .
i was . i am .
good .
you know , if i realized that you were free ,
i would &apos;ve started you tonight .
but that &apos;ll have to be tomorrow .
tomorrow &apos;s the 4th .
is that a problem ?
no . i &apos;ll be there .
ready .
jack , thank you so much .
hey .
this has always been one of my favorite sights ...
you , the sunset ...
this beautiful piece of the world that we share .
well , that &apos;s funny .
i was just thinking
how it &apos;s one of the loneliest places on earth .
yeah , tonight ...
tonight , maybe .
but tomorrow &apos;s a new day .
do you love her , conrad ?
i love you and i always have .
well , that &apos;s not exactly how frank tells it .
he says that you &apos;re obsessed with lydia .
that &apos;s because frank is obsessed with you .
well , that &apos;s absurd .
are you going to deny that you had this affair now ?
no , no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m saying that everything frank &apos;s been feeding you
has been designed to drive a wedge between us .
that &apos;s exactly what he said you &apos;d tell me .
lydia didn &apos;t jump off the balcony ,
victoria .
she was screaming for help
when she went over the edge .
what are you saying ?
help ! somebody help !
our man frank was trying to kill her , victoria .
victoria , it &apos;s frank .
i have some bad news to report .
lydia davis just jumped off her balcony .
call me when you get this .
there &apos;s no reason to believe that he won &apos;t do the same ...
to either of us .
in case he does .
really nice wine , tyler .
i can &apos;t remember . is it pronounced montrachay or montrachet ?
no idea .
i just point to the highest number in the right column
and assume it doesn &apos;t suck .
well , i don &apos;t care how it pronounce . just keep it coming .
just keep it to yourself , ash .
sorry . i &apos;m nervous about that party tomorrow night .
if it &apos;s not a scratch then i &apos;m scared that i &apos;m get the axe .
oh , you say that every day .
no , this is different .
daniel &apos;s parents is in a firing mood .
they sacked that security guy ,
frank stevens , today .
yeah , i can &apos;t say i &apos;m sad to see him go .
the guy was pretty tightly wound .
well , he &apos;s their longest @-@ sanding employee .
no one &apos;s safe .
listen , i &apos;m sure your party will be a big success .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t be there to see .
you want me to come to keep you company tomorrow ?
i tip my bartenders very well .
smart , emily . offer him cash .
daddy froze his trust .
i think he &apos;s ready for a new leash .
ignore him .
i &apos;d love your company ,
but i &apos;d much rather you go to the party .
and it might be a good opportunity for you
to spend some time with my mother .
hmm . a necessary evil .
to necessary evils .
cheers .
it &apos;s a slow night tonight .
everyone must be saving themselves for the 4th .
must be .
your buddy rick
is still the maitre d &apos; over mirko &apos;s right ?
you know , i @-@ i want to take charlotte
someplace nice this weekend .
you can &apos;t afford mirko &apos;s
you can &apos;t even afford the jacket you need to walking at the place .
well , now you &apos;re skipping ahead of me here .
so can i borrow a couple hundred bucks
to take charlotte to mirko &apos;s ?
so let me spare you some heart break .
no .
no , that--that girl &apos;s
probably got a dozen ivy league jerks
draining their trust funds trying to impress her .
don &apos;t waste your time
or my money .
we still talking about charlotte
or did we move on to your girl issues ?
fine . i &apos;ll figure it out myself .
and so we &apos;re headed to the berry islands on a g @-@ 5
because , well , they &apos;re looking for a tax haven ,
and they want me to show them around
and i mean you can get the entire island there cheap
like $ 5 or $ 6 million .
oh , pocket change , really .
so why did they ask you to take them around the islands ?
his parents own one .
oh , so you &apos;ve been ?
me ? no . i mean we were to be there
a couple of years ago , around chrismas .
i forget why we didn &apos;t .
yeah . i think there was a hurricane .
does &apos;t hurricane season end in november ?
weird weather that year .
so where do you guys fly into down there ?
most of the airstrips are so short .
half are unpaved .
i don &apos;t know . we just landed .
you just landed ...
on a dirt runway in a $ 60 million plane ?
what are you saying , that i &apos;m making this up ?
i &apos;m saying , last time anyone went down there
looking for tax shelters ,
they had to take a turboprop .
and why would anybody want to hide their money in the bahamas ?
their privacy laws were stripped in &apos; 06 .
what &apos;s your point ?
either you &apos;re confused
or you &apos;re giving spectacularly bad advice .
forget it . i &apos;m just trying to tell a story .
oh , i believe that .
you know what ?
tyler , come on . don &apos;t be like that .
me ?
why don &apos;t you tell your girlfriend to take a step back ?
who does she think she &apos;s talking to anyways ?
that &apos;s a very good question .
i &apos;m outta here .
sorry , ashley .
tyler , wait up .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you lately ,
but you &apos;re becoming a real grade @-@ a bitch .
what are you doing here ?
i just wanted to make sure you were okay .
you have to leave , frank .
conrad will go crazy if he knows that you &apos;re down here .
conrad doesn &apos;t concern me .
you &apos;re all i care about .
please . he &apos;s got a gun .
what did he tell you ?
he didn &apos;t tell me anything . he showed me .
i saw the surveillance video .
and i know what you did to lydia .
what surveillance video ?
i saw it , frank .
don &apos;t even try to deny it .
i &apos;m not denying it .
i did it for you .
victoria .
everything all right ?
i &apos;m just getting some water . i &apos;ll be right upstairs .
morning , mr. and mrs. grayson .
happy 4th .
god bless america .
is daniel still sleeping ?
ah , he must be .
already on a bartender &apos;s schedule ,
and he hasn &apos;t even started the job yet .
what are you talking about ?
oh , i thought you knew .
uh , he got a job at a bar in montauk .
uh , the stowaway ?
good god . what possessed him ?
well , from what i gathered , emily thought
it would be a good character @-@ building initiative .
she &apos;s got him wrapped around her finger
tighter than a wedding ring .
morning .
when were you planning on telling us
about your new job , daniel ?
can we discuss this after i have my coffee ?
do i really have to explain to you how this might not be
the smartest career choice for you ?
you don &apos;t need to explain anything to me anymore .
i &apos;m an adult .
since dad cut me off , i need to make my own money ,
and you &apos;re just gonna have to trust
that i can make my own decisions .
fine . as long as they are your own .
if this is just about money--
it &apos;s not about money .
i was gonna mention it to you today .
it turns out , my work schedule conflicts with your party .
are you telling me
that you can &apos;t ask them to change your schedule ?
i &apos;m telling you i don &apos;t want to .
do you want me to try talking to him , mrs. grayson ?
please do .
obviously , anything i have to say
carries very little weight with him .
i got some interesting news from ashley last night .
the graysons fired frank .
just as you predicted .
now with frank out of the way ,
it &apos;ll give me a chance to deal with tyler .
godspeed .
morning .
hey . i was just about to come see you .
well , tyler , actually ,
to apologize .
that &apos;s not necessary . i mean , let &apos;s face it .
sometimes the guy just doesn &apos;t know when to shut up .
so you &apos;re not mad at me ?
at you ?
impossible .
what are you doing this morning ?
i &apos;m on my way to work .
jack &apos;s asked me to pull a double shift on my first day .
i &apos;m weirdly nervous about it .
hmm . well , i &apos;ve got just the thing for that .
you &apos;re gonna make me late for work .
it &apos;ll be worth it .
teddy , right ? you manage the building .
i do .
i heard you guys had
quite a scene here the other night .
a tragedy &apos;s what we had .
i just hope ms. davis pulls through .
she &apos;s a real nice lady .
well , i know what she is .
i work for conrad grayson .
listen , mr. grayson left a personal item in the apartment .
if it were to turn up , it could be embarrassing .
i &apos;d much appreciate it if , uh , you &apos;d let me up to retrieve it .
sorry . the police have it sealed .
ongoing investigation .
how many cameras you got working here ?
uh , one at each entrance , two on each floor .
and , uh , how far back do they record ?
be careful with these little guys , yeah ?
there you go .
thanks .
oh , it looks great .
okay . thank you , sir .
okay . open that up for me .
thank you .
beautiful , man .
there you go .
great , thanks .
you &apos;re late .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
but i mean , it is technically a holiday .
look , there are a lot of people who actually need a job ,
so if you &apos;re not gonna take it seriously .
it won &apos;t happen again .
i promise . i just got caught up in some personal business .
what ?
nothing .
daniel .
meet bull .
bull &apos;s gonna take over your training from here .
follow me .
heard you were selling quality market hard @-@ shells .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , guys . i just sold the last one , you know ?
well , that &apos;s funny .
&apos;cause we had a trap ,
shoulda been full this morning ,
but somebody pulled it last night and cleaned us out .
you wouldn &apos;t know anything about that , would you ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
all right !
you know what we do to poachers out here ?
we got a problem ?
dec , come here .
the problem is , little tom thumb
pulled our bugs and sold &apos; em off .
that &apos;s our money in his pocket .
what are they talking about ?
i don &apos;t know .
give him his money .
you sold low .
this isn &apos;t half what we could &apos;ve gotten .
it &apos;s enough .
hey , hey , come on now , guys .
let &apos;s work this out like gentlemen .
now how much would you have gotten for the lobsters ?
$ 300 .
let &apos;s make it $ 400 .
next time you bleed .
how could you be so stupid ?
you don &apos;t mess with guys like that .
look , jack , i need the money .
and you said it yourself .
charlotte &apos;s used to a certain type of lifestyle--
i know , but i just said that
so you &apos;d think twice about getting serious with her ,
not so you &apos;d roll a lobster boat .
well , you know what ?
at least i &apos;m trying to do something about it , okay ?
not like you .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
i mean emily .
you &apos;re crazy about her , and you do nothing about it .
how are you gonna live with yourself ,
knowing you barely even tried ?
come on , jack . you &apos;re twice the man he is .
hey , bull .
think you and the new guy can handle the bar tonight ?
no problem .
call your girlfriend .
you &apos;re going to that party tonight .
and so am i.
freeze it .
i thought we were looking for mr. grayson .
so did i.
emily .
victoria . happy independence day .
you really go all out for this holiday , don &apos;t you ?
well , there &apos;s nothing so precious as freedom ,
is there ?
no , there isn &apos;t .
and you seem particularly untethered tonight .
no daniel ?
unfortunately .
well , tyler said that you encouraged him
to take that bar job .
i just somehow can &apos;t imagine it &apos;ll last .
but a boy just has to get certain things out of his system
until he sees clearly .
try to enjoy yourself .
ashley .
what are you doing here ?
daniel &apos;s working tonight , remember ?
i came to support you ,
and to say that i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what got into me .
i behaved so terribly last night .
yes , you did .
i &apos;m sorry .
is tyler around ? i owe him an apology as well .
i think mrs. grayson dispatched him
to the stowaway in the hopes that he might
be able to drag daniel back to his senses .
isn &apos;t that the guy who brought that old dog
to your housewarming party ?
that &apos;s jack porter .
he owns the stowaway .
well , what on earth is he doing here ?
oh , nolan . i should &apos;ve guessed .
excuse me .
what does a guy have to do
to get a drink around here , huh ?
ty , what are you doing here ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at the party with ashley ?
well , she &apos;s working , so i came to see you .
i &apos;m working , too .
look , i didn &apos;t mean to belittle
the whole bartending thing last night .
i feel bad .
the truth is , i &apos;m kind of envious .
right .
you &apos;re forging your own path , making your own destiny .
that &apos;s romantic stuff , man .
well , thank you .
and if i &apos;m gonna keep you company on your first night ,
the least you could do is join me for a shot .
absolutely not . no way .
oh , come on . we &apos;re--
we &apos;re christening the &quot; s.s. daniel , &quot;
navigating the waters of uncertainty
in search of his own future .
it &apos;s beautiful .
all right . all right . all right . one shot .
how about a bourbon , huh ?
something from the top shelf ?
this good enough for you ?
perfect .
cheers . to the working class .
yeah , i think some of my friends
are having a thing later , so ...
but you guys are having fun , right ?
yes , yes . we &apos;re having a wonderful time .
it sure is .
asian markets are in a tailspin ,
and i can &apos;t get my broker on the phone .
any advice before i drown myself in the ocean ?
well , too late .
the only thing that can save me now is a pretty girl
you &apos;ll do .
asian markets ?
well , you know , i @-@ i read the &quot; journal &quot; on the way over .
i &apos;m glad you decided to come .
you want to hit the bar ?
i @-@ i gotta tell you something first .
you know i can &apos;t compete with all this , right ?
all what ?
this . your life .
i have no money .
i mean , at one point , jack was gonna sell the bar ,
and--and then i would &apos;ve gotten a piece , but , uh ,
that didn &apos;t happen .
and , uh , i was glad at the time ,
you know , because--because the bar &apos;s an excuse
to--to stay around here .
and--and--and that means i &apos;ll be close to you .
but it &apos;s also not ,
&apos;cause like i said before , i can &apos;t compete .
you know what i &apos;m sayin &apos; ?
i &apos;m rich . you &apos;re not .
who cares ?
you ...
your brother moves quick .
you ? not so much .
thank you .
i was hoping i &apos;d find you .
what are you doing here ?
let me guess . nolan dragged you along as his plus one .
no , no . it was my idea to come .
maybe not a good one . we &apos;ll see .
hey ... is , uh ...
is there somewhere we can go ?
hey , give me another .
shoot . i &apos;m sorry .
hang on .
hang on .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , hey , hey . you all right , danny ?
yeah . i don &apos;t , i don &apos;t ...
i feel kinda out of it all of a sudden .
oh , come here . why don &apos;t you sit down ?
i think something &apos;s wrong .
okay , yeah , well , i know .
you &apos;re under a lot of pressure
and you &apos;re starting to feel it .
you jumping into this new thing with emily ,
your dad cutting you off ,
and now starting this new job ...
he okay ?
yeah , yeah . uh , he &apos;ll be fine .
is there somewhere he could lie down ?
yeah . come on .
there we go . there you go .
come on . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m sorry to drag you away from the party .
i just didn &apos;t feel right
telling you this over there .
telling me what ?
ever since i first saw you ...
i knew there was something about you .
and i couldn &apos;t put my finger on it ...
until now .
look , sometimes
you get a boat ...
out on the open water ,
and you catch a wind ,
and the sails fill ,
and she comes to life under you .
and it feels like
more than just wind and water and vessel .
it feels like there &apos;s something else
going on .
something pulling you forward
and surrounding you at the same time .
am i making any sense ?
you &apos;re making perfect sense .
it &apos;s just , you &apos;re saying it to the wrong girl , jack .
i &apos;m seeing daniel .
i thought you knew that .
i know . i know .
and normally , i wouldn &apos;t do anything like this .
but i feel like this feeling ...
comes along once or twice
in a lifetime , if we &apos;re lucky .
tell me i &apos;m alone in this .
tell me i &apos;m alone in this ,
and i won &apos;t bother you again .
i &apos;m so sorry , jack .
no , it &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s okay . i ...
i just-- i just thought ...
let me--let me walk you back to the party .
no , you don &apos;t have to do that .
i ...
jack--
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
don &apos;t feel like you have to say anything .
daniel is ...
he seems like a nice guy .
and i shouldn &apos;t have put you on the spot like that , and ...
i &apos;m really sorry .
come on , danny .
there .
now that &apos;s better , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
okay , now back to this whole emily thing .
now you can &apos;t be objective , but i can .
hey , hey .
she &apos;s all wrong for you , man .
you don &apos;t know her .
no , i know , but i know you , danny .
i know you . all right ?
now come on .
lay down . there you go .
i don &apos;t want to lay down .
get off me .
fine .
have it your way .
ooh , ooh , ooh . mini beef wellingtons .
do not mind if i do .
mm . thanks .
you know what this is ?
we need to talk .
mrs. grayson .
tyler , what happened to you ?
i was just trying to offer him some guidance .
i guess he didn &apos;t like what i had to say .
daniel did this to you ?
yes , but it wasn &apos;t his fault .
he &apos;d been drinking .
and i @-@ i should &apos;ve known better than to confront him like--
i don &apos;t know what to say .
this is not the son i raised
and it &apos;s not the friend that i love like a brother ,
but don &apos;t worry .
this has just got me more intent on seeing he gets on the right track .
i &apos;m gonna get you some bandages .
no ,
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a first @-@ aid kit in the pool house .
i &apos;ll be fine . okay ?
whose ideas was it to make the video ?
what ? you mean the double rainbow thing ?
hell if i know . guy &apos;s a genius .
how much is conrad offering you ?
conrad ? no , no , wait , wait .
wait . you &apos;re making a mistake .
it &apos;s not conrad you want .
so daniel did that to you , huh ?
yeah . your boyfriend &apos;s got a violent streak .
you might want to be careful who you &apos;re dealing with .
i &apos;m always careful
and i always know who i &apos;m dealing with .
what the hell are you doing in here ?
just leaving .
join me , won &apos;t you ?
frank is here .
what ?
he knows it was me that made the tape .
how ?
because he &apos;s better at this than we are .
the guy was about to blow my kneecaps off .
you &apos;re on your own .
hello ?
declan ?
like life , revenge can be a messy business ...
and both would be much simpler if only our heads could figure out
which way our hearts will go .
but the heart has its reasons ,
of which reason cannot know .
victoria , i know you &apos;re there .
look , i know you &apos;re frightened , but you shouldn &apos;t be ,
at least , not of me .
i &apos;m not frightened of you , frank .
i just can &apos;t talk to you anymore .
wait , wait , wait . don &apos;t hang up .
just answer one question .
how did conrad get the surveillance equipment
inside lydia &apos;s apartment ?
i assume he had it installed .
on his own , without me knowing ?
what difference does it make ?
it doesn &apos;t change what you did .
yes , of course it does .
look , i think i &apos;m being set up .
in fact , i think we &apos;re all being set up .
victoria ?
victoria ?
don &apos;t call my wife again ,
or i will find you and i will put an end to you .
are we clear ?
what the hell are you doing ? the man is a killer .
is he ?
you saw for yourself what he &apos;s capable of .
i don &apos;t know what i saw .
who made that recording , conrad ?
was it you ?
no .
