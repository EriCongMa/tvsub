第一季 第十集
$ 50 in the douche bag jar ?
absolutely , man .
yes , absolutely .
why so much ?
i feel like it should actually be more in the 100 , 200 range ,
so that &apos;s a discount .
think about what you did , schmidt .
i lost it .
i lost the party bus .
the party bus for your birthday party ?
yeah .
apparently ,
my business isn &apos;t as important
as frankie muniz &apos;s .
they canceled my rez .
there &apos;s nothing i can do ; the party &apos;s off .
you should torch them on yelp .
actually , i can do it .
i have an account under the name fantastic jacques .
he &apos;s a french diplomat
with very little patience .
or you could just get another bus .
in two days ?
okay , yeah , sure , winston .
w @-@ why don &apos;t i just go down to the party bus store ,
where all the party buses have a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art sound system ,
a stripper pole , a love grotto ,
and a steering wheel in the shape of a boob .
you honk the nipple .
it &apos;s pretty awesome .
just have the party at a bar .
nick , this is it .
this is my 29th birthday party .
this is the year . after this ,
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s just ... just all darkness .
was he crying a little ?
hey , i just came to make sure you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m not okay , jess .
i had to cancel my birthday party .
it &apos;s social suicide .
i can feel my it factor going away .
and then what am i gonna tell benjamin ?
why are you so worried about benjamin ?
he &apos;s your friend .
we have a very weird , girl @-@ style friendship
where we kind of hate each other .
we &apos;re bronemies .
he &apos;s my fremesis .
i &apos;m so confused right now .
okay , look , benjamin and i-- we were suitemates in college .
benjamin , i can &apos;t wait to get to l.a.
we &apos;re going to have so much sex--
in the morning ,
in the afternoon ,
at bedtime .
mmm , peanuts .
i &apos;m telling you , man ,
i &apos;m gonna run that town one day-- you &apos;ll see .
i &apos;m gonna write you a check right now for $ 100 million .
how do you like that ?
damn , dude .
and this is a real check .
you can cash it when i &apos;m rich and awesome .
give me about four years .
do the song .
we built this schmidty
we built this schmidty on tootsie rolls .
if it wasn &apos;t for benjamin , i ,
i never would have become a los angeles baller .
holla .
i changed everything about myself , jess .
i lost all the weight , i changed my clothes ,
i even dropped my voice half an octave ,
but it wasn &apos;t enough .
i guess i &apos;ll just never be cool enough , jess .
okay , i &apos;ve got it .
we are going to throw schmidt a birthday party .
no .
yes , &apos; cause it &apos;s his 29th birthday and we care .
jess , schmidt &apos;s world is different than ours .
they speak a different language .
they shorten every word to one syllable .
okay , he once called an oven an &quot; ovs . &quot;
he calls an airport &quot; airp . &quot;
he called ketchup &quot; ketch . &quot;
last month he went to a party called
bros before hos on the moon .
what does that even mean ?
and the dress code was &quot; yacht flair . &quot;
what ? - schmidt has a friend
who legally changed his middle name to doin &apos; it .
yeah , doin &apos; it .
just one word : doinit .
you are not emotionally , mentally , and spiritually
prepared to throw these d @-@ bags a party .
i &apos;m gonna do some research .
actually , i &apos;m sorry , i do have to go .
i apologize .
where are you going ?
and why are you wearing your jury duty pants ?
i &apos;m not , man , i &apos;m just-- mumble , mumble , mumble .
come on , lawyer party ...
the classic fifth date .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m not gonna apologize for it .
i got nothing to apologize for .
i owe you nothing .
no , i &apos;m having a really fun time .
i love wearing a bill cosby sweater
in front of a bunch of lawyers who are younger than me .
hello , i &apos;m bill cosby , do you like pudding ?
my son &apos;s name is theo and his best friend is cockroach .
that supposed to be bill cosby ?
yeah . that &apos;s as good as i can do .
let &apos;s see yours .
would you like to hear
how he really sounds ?
yes .
i want to get some more pudding .
that &apos;s the worst bill co ... how about this ?
i got a daughter named rudy huxtable ,
and she &apos;s the cutest of all my daughters .
i &apos;m really glad that you &apos;re here with me .
yeah , i &apos;m happy you let me be here with you .
no , i really am
because i got to , like , kiss all the asses
of these 24 @-@ year @-@ old law students
to try to get &apos; em to work here .
i went to law school .
you went to law school ?
yes .
i quit .
quit law school ?
yes .
why ?
because i realized i hated lawyers .
he says to the lawyer .
and for some reason i find you
ridiculously attractive for saying that .
why don &apos;t you kiss my ass , then ?
look , julia , i got turned around .
i thought we were doing a flirty back @-@ and @-@ forth ...
i &apos;m actually just kidding .
i really do want to do that .
oh , you would ?
well , we can make that happen .

i am the opposite of married .
before you , there was like , there was like nothing .
i &apos;ve got , like , no girls on the horizon .
in a hot way .
why don &apos;t you ever invite me to your place
or , like , tell me all that much about yourself ?
it &apos;s weird-- i don &apos;t even know where you live .
i &apos;m 30 years old ,
and i live in a loft with three roommates .
in a hot way .
but maybe you can kiss my butt when i talk like bill cosby .
all right , let &apos;s go .
