&quot; staring at the end &quot;
i don &apos;t like questions without any answers .
like &quot; where do we go when we die ? &quot;
i mean , i know what happens physiologically speaking ,
but beyond that , what really happens ?
anything ?
that &apos;s what you start asking yourself
when you live on a clock .
all these questions without any answers --
they &apos;ll drive you nuts .
that &apos;s why i like what i do --
fixing babies , birthing babies .
no ambiguity there , no questions ,
just answers --
clear , precise , obvious answers .
and life -- beautiful new life .
hope for the future .
god , i miss that .
morning !
robbins , are you ever not chirpy ?
does that ever happen ?
are you ever not snarky ?
also , you snore .
i @-@ i can &apos;t crash here again tonight without earplugs .
okay , so , we have seven cases today .
the first one is in two hours .
also , it &apos;s friday , so that &apos;s mri day .
you know the drill .
47 minutes of my very limited life @-@ span wasted .
mm , come on , come on .
god ! i &apos;m coming .
stop chirping .
stop snarking .
whew ! after this , we &apos;ve got
the diaphragmatic hernia . baby &apos;s 27 weeks .
we &apos;ll do a , um , tracheal balloon occlusion ...
figured you could use this ...
which should ,
if we &apos;re lucky , ensure the blood ...
... before the big lecture .
oh , um , thanks .
thank you .
um , they already scheduled
a follow @-@ up procedure on the baby , as well .
you &apos;re cultivating - quite a bit of buzz , you know ?
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
i heard from two hospitals wanting us to record your talk .
... but we won &apos;t be too close to the due date .
and if -- - i have a lot on my plate right now ,
just with , uh , herman and her tumor .
uh , her surgery .
i really need to focus ...
on the tumor .
don &apos;t need any distractions , and you &apos;re ...
very hard to ignore .
hey , i ju-- it was just coffee .
no , i @-@ i so appreciate the coffee .
uh , i was just getting some coffee for myself , and --
it &apos;s good coffee . it --
it &apos;s great coffee .
i @-@ i , uh -- i can --
i can just get my own if -- if you --
i mean , you can get your own so easily .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to get my own coffee . i --
i mean i do . i can . i will .
i -- i can get my own coffee all day long . i just --
owen .
thank you for bringing me the coffee .
i really like it .
uh , you &apos;re welcome .
so , how &apos;s my head ?
the tumor seems stable .
i was worried about the inferomedial margin ,
but the good news is , there &apos;s no sign of growth .
it hasn &apos;t invaded the optic nerve yet .
well , how long till it does ?
i need a number , shepherd . i have things to plan .
about six weeks -- maybe eight
if you go in for the - localized radiation treatments
i &apos;ve prescribed for you .
i &apos;d like for those to start today .
no , no , no , no .
i tried that . hated it .
doctor &apos;s orders . it is our best chance
to shrink the part of the tumor on your optic chiasm .
oh , crap .
glenda castillo !
we &apos;re headed to surgery , dr. bailey .
no time to talk .
but you haven &apos;t given me an answer .
actually , i have . it was no .
but you haven &apos;t given me the right answer .
you could at least meet with her .
i &apos;ve seen the case , okay ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry ,
but i &apos;m working on a very limited time frame
with a very specific list of surgeries to teach robbins ,
and glenda castillo isn &apos;t one of them .
okay , well , as a personal favor to me , just meeet her--
i have no time to make it personal .
it &apos;s a no . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll get you some names -- good people .
she can see one of them .
um , sorry .
three down , all these to go .
we &apos;ve got four months &apos; worth of surgeries up here .
i mean , how are we gonna get
four months of surgeries done in eight weeks ?
we just do , i suppose .
you &apos;ll do the next one yourself . i &apos;ll watch .
what ?
no . no , thank you .
i appreciate the vote of confidence ,
but i &apos;m not even actually sure that i know how --
i need to see what you &apos;ve learned ,
what you can and can &apos;t do on your own
while i &apos;m still around to fix it when you screw up .
gee , thanks .
it &apos;s not a vote of confidence . it &apos;s a necessity .
training wheels are off , robbins .
time is up . what &apos;s next ?
uh , your radiation treatment .
radiation hasn &apos;t worked yet .
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s suddenly supposed to start working .
radiation is bull--
shepherd says that it &apos;s necessary .
she &apos;s the doctor here .
&quot; life will out . &quot;
the origins and lessons of life and evolution
are long and complex ,
but what they basically boil down to is , life will out .
life will always find a way to continue .
always .
life ... will ... out .
this is a massive grade iv astrocytoma .
i want you to take a look at it .
really look .
look at its size .
look at the way it invades healthy tissue .
look at its vasculature .
it is blood and tissue and flesh .
it &apos;s growing ...
... adapting to its environment ,
struggling to survive , to stay alive .
it is alive .
we don &apos;t like to think of it that way ,
but it &apos;s nested in the womb of a human brain ,
feeding on its host , growing and fighting for life --
almost like a fetus .
no , scratch that .
let &apos;s just for science and giggles
say exactly like a fetus .
because like a healthy fetus , it is thriving .
you know , there are even some types of tumors
that grow teeth , hair ...
... a stray eye .
have i repulsed you ?
it &apos;s gross , right ?
yeah .
i mean , that is a problem .
nobody wants something that nasty in their head .
i &apos;d like you for one moment to consider the idea
that , to the tumor , we are the problem ,
we are the invader .
we are the danger .
to the tumor , we are the cancer .
and the tumor ?
well , the tumor sees itself as a sweet , cute , fat @-@ cheeked baby
just trying to make its way into the world ,
and we want to stop it , destroy it ,
tear it from its happy little home like barbarians .
to the tumor ,
we are the soulless , murderous monsters .
why do i do this ?
why do i call it &quot; baby &quot; and talk about killing it ?
because this kind of tumor deserves respect .
it deserves a little humanity .
charming , isn &apos;t it ?
they put clouds on the ceiling to distract you .
least they could do is put something interesting up there ,
like porn .
it &apos;s not just a tumor .
it &apos;s ingenuity .
it &apos;s strength .
it &apos;s adaptability .
it &apos;s poetry .
it &apos;s one of god &apos;s masterpieces .
it is alive .
you okay ?
sure .
and like any living thing , it wants to stay alive .
like any living thing ,
it is going to fight like hell to survive .
and when i saw open that skull and come face @-@ to @-@ face with it ,
with that tumor , with that living thing ,
it will be almost impossible to remove ...
well , i &apos;ll see you after .
... because it would rather destroy the brain that holds it
than go gently into that good night .
it is alive .
and what &apos;s it all come down to ?
life ...
will ...
out .
so , our fat @-@ cheeked @-@ baby tumor
that &apos;s nestled in that brain ,
it &apos;s a creature of habit .
it has the same routine day in and day out --
to grow , to spread out , to take up space .
that &apos;s it .
at this point , our baby tumor is so enmeshed , so invasive ,
it &apos;s touching virtually every single brain structure .
it &apos;s pushed existing tissue aside ,
shoved brain matter out of the way to find room for itself .
how do you remove it without destroying the brain around it ?
how do you kill the baby without killing the mother ?
i stare at these scans , and the tumor stares back at me ,
daring me to try to extract it .
i mean , this tumor is bold and brazen .
this tumor thinks it &apos;s in charge .
this tumor thinks it owns the place .
i don &apos;t have to explain myself to you .
you missed your radiation session this morning .
i told you , i &apos;m not doing that anymore .
that is not your call .
my tumor , my head -- it absolutely is my call .
the tumor will be - exponentially easier to remove
after the radiation .
nicole , please .
go to radiation !
i will think about it .
o @-@ kay .
the thing about a tumor like this is ,
you can &apos;t let it intimidate you .
the tumor isn &apos;t smarter than you .
you just need a plan of attack .
here . feel that ?
you must be methodical .
you want to find a spot with just the right amount of give .
that &apos;s where you want to cut .
scalpel .
point of access is key .
you &apos;re up , robbins .
i know .
i &apos;ve never done that part before .
so , um , you were really serious about that ?
it &apos;s time . make the cut .
but i don &apos;t know -- i &apos;ve never --
make the cut .
and then you start .
that is the most daunting step --
pushing a blade into that first squishy blob of flesh ...
because the first cut is what sets the tone .
it determines every single move from that point on .
so , you have to be careful .
you have to be sure .
or you &apos;re in trouble .
it &apos;s like a ...
just look at them .
who ? -arizona and herman -- they &apos;re practically joined at the hip .
i &apos;ll take one of those , too .
well , she is herman &apos;s fellow .
isn &apos;t she sort of supposed to follow herman around ?
they &apos;re laughing all the time ,
and arizona seems so ...
happy -- like really happy .
so ?
you seem happy ... ish .
what do you even care ?
i don &apos;t , obviously .
i &apos;m just making conversation .
don &apos;t you guys think it &apos;s weird how
they &apos;re always together ?
they &apos;re not always together .
they do bunk up together sometimes .
what ?
alex .
robbins has been crashing with herman .
she hasn &apos;t slept at the house all week .
what ? !
alex .
i @-@ i don &apos;t mean like that .
they &apos;re not together together , and you know that .
mm @-@ hmm .
arizona used to hate her . now they &apos;re having sleepovers ?
well , it &apos;s a good thing , right , that they &apos;re getting along ?
herman &apos;s not exactly the warmest person , so --
when you talk to derek tonight ,
would you ask him something for me without saying it &apos;s for me ?
i don &apos;t know that i w--
just ask him what he &apos;d use
to avoid disrupting the gratiolet radiations
off the geniculate body of the thalamus .
why don &apos;t you ask him that ?
no , no , no .
no , no . that &apos;s the point . you ask him .
i can &apos;t ask him for help .
i cannot listen to the smugness in his voice .
you can hear it .
he has transcontinental smugness . you know what ?
forget it . i &apos;m fine . i don &apos;t need him .
i don &apos;t need derek .
i will figure it out myself .
when did this happen ?
she found the perfect rebound
without having to actually find a rebound --
i mean , she just gets all the good times and the fun ,
none of the bad times or the mess ,
no chance of getting hurt .
you don &apos;t even have to wax . it &apos;s not fair !
oh , my god . am i seriously wishing for a sexless relationship
where i don &apos;t have to groom myself ?
is that where i am now ?
it sounds good to me .
welcome to my life these days .
you chicks need to get laid .
that also sounds good to me .
not without the grooming .
it &apos;s in there . he can find it .
what , he can &apos;t do a little work first ?
i like her .
eddie .
excuse me ?
uh , glenda castillo ,
the patient you and herman turned down last week ,
her husband &apos;s name was eddie .
i lost him six months ago
after he was injured in a head @-@ on collision .
my hands were inside of his body
when his heart stopped beating .
my hands held glenda &apos;s
when i told her eddie died on my watch .
three weeks later , - she found out she was pregnant .
she &apos;s not insured ,
but she remembered me and this hospital ,
so , she came here
to see if i could give her some prenatal care ,
and guess what we found out .
her baby has a tumor --
a large , dangerous tumor
that &apos;s not just messing with the baby &apos;s system ,
it &apos;s messing with hers .
i couldn &apos;t save her husband &apos;s life ,
but i can help save her baby .
i @-@ i owe this woman that much .
herman has to take her on as a patient .
just -- just have her meet glenda , all right ?
then she &apos;ll ...
i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t !
i can &apos;t trick her into
seeing a patient she doesn &apos;t want to treat .
who &apos;s in charge of her schedule ?
who tells her where to go and when ?
who tells her what surgery or post @-@ op or anonymous consult
she should see next ?
i &apos;m concerned about her blood pressure .
it &apos;s increased to 140 systolic in the past week ,
and her swelling &apos;s gotten worse .
uh , i used to have ankles .
now i have balloons with toes .
so , your baby has a large tumor in his lower back .
it &apos;s most likely benign ,
but because of its size and vascular nature ,
it could cause an accumulation of fluids in the baby .
but the tumor can be removed , right ?
dr. bailey says amazing things about you ,
that you &apos;re one of the best .
bailey said that ?
how flattering .
that was glenda castillo .
i told you no twice now .
and you , how am i - supposed to trust you at all
when you pull something like that ?
she didn &apos;t do anything
except try to get your help on a patient
who needs your help .
but if you heard her story , if you knew she was --
is that how bailey convinced you ?
it &apos;s a tactic , robbins ,
appealing to your sad , bleeding heart .
doesn &apos;t work with me .
well , then , let me appeal to your ego .
you walk around here telling anyone who will listen
that you &apos;re the best .
well , then , be the best .
you can save her baby &apos;s life ,
so save that baby &apos;s life !
no .
what the hell ?
robbins , drop it .
no , i get that -- i get that i &apos;ve seen tumors like that before ,
but this can &apos;t all be about my education .
i mean , at some point , i have to --
at some point , we have to make decisions and stick to them .
i wish we had time , but we don &apos;t .
we have very little control over the time we have ,
and we have a plan .
can &apos;t we make an exception ?
can &apos;t we just , you know , sort of adjust the plan ?
you -- fine . you want to ?
adjust the plan .
what are you doing ?
take down one of these cards
so we have time to help mrs.castillo.
which one ?
how about meghan carlson -- congenital airway obstruction ?
her husband &apos;s in iraq right now .
or julie hall -- vasa previa .
she went through two years of fertility treatments .
so , pick one .
decide which baby doesn &apos;t get to live
so glenda castillo &apos;s does .
go ahead .
pick a card . you choose .
that &apos;s what i thought .
no .
no .
get me out !
get me out of here !
get me out !
you have to .
i don &apos;t .
the radiation treatments are going to help .
they are gonna shrink the borders of the tumor ,
which will make it easier to resect .
it &apos;s a minimal gain for you .
i will take what i can get . i am trying to save your life !
you are making me feel like i &apos;ve already died .
i &apos;m sick . i &apos;m losing my hair .
i refuse to spend - the last few months of my life
feeling like a pile of crap .
no more .
that &apos;s final .
i am going to give you more than a few months .
i am going to save your life .
and i am about to get up in front of a bunch of people
and tell them how i plan on doing it .
it makes it really hard for me to do that
or even care about doing that
when you don &apos;t seem to care at all !
well , that &apos;s your problem .
well , the word &apos;s spreading .
this was a good idea , hunt --
a master class in neurosurgery .
this is gonna put - amelia shepherd on the map .
unless it fails .
it won &apos;t .
if it does ...
there &apos;s a lesson in that , too .
so , she just spitballs this stuff with you ?
it &apos;s just the two of you hanging out , talking tumor ?
pretty much .
i want to talk tumor !
i want to talk tumor so bad .
oh , my god . look at that thing
previous attempts
to treat dr. herman &apos;s tumor with radiation
proved unsuccessful .
i had hoped to use high radioactive doses
to reduce the margins ,
but at this juncture ,
that course seems to be unrealistic .
but that &apos;s not enough to make me quit .
this tumor is fierce
and intimidating and aggressive ,
but so am i.
now , the trick to this is ,
you can &apos;t touch the vessel while you &apos;re lasering the mass --
not even a little bit .
if you do ...
the field fills with blood , obscuring the camera ,
and visualization is compromised .
first , i need to see the tumor , all of it --
every margin , every last ripple and ridge .
so , what do you do ?
i have two choices --
open her up - and stop the bleeding if i can ,
or deliver the baby regardless of how early .
very good .
so , i will employ fluorescein dye
to delineate every border of the tumor ,
to help me anticipate every possible problem
before i get to it .
i don &apos;t want to leave anything up to chance .
what happened ?
the pressure &apos;s dropped .
she &apos;s in a lot of pain , and she &apos;s cramping .
it hurts ! it hurts , it hurts !
it &apos;s okay , julie . we &apos;ve got you , we &apos;ve got you .
she has a vasa previa .
she &apos;s scheduled for an ablation tomorrow .
i &apos;ve been trying to get her pressure back up ,
but there is no fetal heartbeat .
damn it . where &apos;s her husband ?
is that blood ? ! i &apos;m bleeding ? !
gown me . keep him out of here .
robbins , you &apos;re gonna get this baby out right here , right now .
here ?
we need a c @-@ section tray set up in here .
call peds . get an incubator , stat .
wait ! what ? ! i &apos;m gonna have the baby now ? !
julie , i &apos;m gonna give you something
to calm you down , okay ?
i never had to do a crash &quot; c &quot; on my own before , okay ?
i mean , n @-@ not like this .
you know what to do .
it &apos;s the same three basic steps , just like any other c @-@ section --
open the abdomen , open the uterus , deliver .
okay ,
i &apos;m okay .
pressure &apos;s steady at 100 / 60 .
okay , i @-@ i can do this .
betadine .
okay .
robbins ? - i &apos;ll do -- i &apos;ll do this .
it &apos;s fine , robbins .
i &apos;ll do it .
scalpel .
i &apos;m so sorry .
we did everything we could do .
i &apos;m so sorry .
good job . let &apos;s go .
stop crying .
oh , for the love of --
stop crying ! - i &apos;m --
stop it now ! just ...
stop it right now .
there &apos;s no time for crying .
we have work to do .
what ?
h @-@ how can you even --
&apos;cause that &apos;s the way it goes , robbins .
call bailey .
tell her we &apos;re on .
now , arguably , the most important part of the brain
is the part that makes us hope ...
dream ...
imagine .
one singular , almost immeasurable part
is what makes you you ...
and me me ...
and everyone ... everyone .
it &apos;s technically called the fornix ,
but i call it the &quot; dream box . &quot;
the question is ...
... what happens when the dream box is being invaded ,
when a tumor is so large , so demanding ,
it &apos;s sucking the dream box dry ?
it &apos;s taking over --
it &apos;s stealing away hopes and dreams .
imagine , when that tumor is removed ,
what -- what will actually be left ?
or , rather , who is left ?
anything ?
anyone ?
i remember my mom telling me once
that when we die , we go to heaven .
i couldn &apos;t picture it .
all i could imagine was what we see in cartoons --
little people in robes with wings , sitting on clouds .
but nobody really knows what &apos;s up there , do they ?
when i was a kid ,
i used to think - that we were like dandelions --
like , the part that makes us us would just blow away
and land and grow into --
i don &apos;t want to be buried , by the way .
have me cremated .
w-- excuse me ?
if i survive the surgery but don &apos;t wake up ,
give me five days -- a week , tops --
then pull the plug . - this is --
we don &apos;t need to be talking about this .
if i do wake up but i &apos;m dependent on vents or tubes ,
pull the plug then , too .
y @-@ you know what ? - you &apos;re not -- you &apos;re not dying .
you &apos;re not gonna wake up gorked .
shepherd knows - what she &apos;s doing . she does . - okay . sure .
she does !
i heard you .
that bird is gonna poop on us .
what &apos;s next today ?
glenda castillo .
i &apos;m so glad you brought me back in .
have a look .
well , the teratoma has grown .
it &apos;s showing early signs of hydrops .
is everything okay ?
glenda , your baby &apos;s retaining fluid ,
which is starting to affect his heart .
i &apos;m recommending we do the surgery tonight .
tonight ?
no , that &apos;s way too soon .
the tumor is creating pressure on your placenta .
it &apos;s not only endangering the baby ,
but now it &apos;s putting you at risk .
but my baby wouldn &apos;t survive , would he ,
if you suddenly had to deliver ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m only 24 weeks along ,
and i @-@ i know that it would help him
if he had time to grow , right ?
if i could just hold on for a few more weeks ...
it &apos;s not what &apos;s best for you .
i don &apos;t care about me .
glenda , if dr. herman thinks that --
no , my husband is dead .
but this baby that is inside of me ,
this baby of ours , i cannot risk his life .
i won &apos;t .
so , if there is a choice
between helping me or helping my baby ,
i choose my baby .
what does she think we &apos;re trying to do here ?
i am not negotiating with a patient .
i am the doctor . i &apos;m gonna tell her when we &apos;re go --
i &apos;m sorry .
robbins , what &apos;s the hell ?
what &apos;s funny about this ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s just --
it &apos;s funny listening to you get so bent out of shape
when this is the exact same thing
that you &apos;ve been doing to amelia shepherd
ever since she offered to save her life .
i mean , she has . exactly .
&quot; we &apos;ll do the surgery when i &apos;m ready . &quot;
and it &apos;s so frustrating .
it &apos;s torture , and it drives us crazy .
so , it &apos;s just fun to watch it happen to you .
it &apos;s like divine justice .
pretend that i &apos;m not here .
keep going .
i will give ms. castillo an extra week ,
but i want her admitted .
and if she so much as hiccups funny ,
i &apos;m taking her to surgery .
j-- understood .
hey , thank you for taking her case .
oh , shut up .
i just need to have a second ...
how do i access that area of the brain
when it &apos;s so hidden ?
and once i access that area ,
even with the perfect tools , the perfect approach ...
... how do i keep from screwing it up ?
if there &apos;s edema , it &apos;s post @-@ fixed .
it &apos;s too narrow , too close the fornix .
if i hit the hypothalamus , game over .
not gonna work , not gonna work , not gonna work .
come on !
do you want some food ?
have i figured this out yet ?
no .
then i don &apos;t want any food .
this has never been done before .
all these steps in this order on this kind of tumor
has never been done .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
who do i even think i am ? who am i to even try this ?
okay , a bad thing .
have you called your brother ?
what did i say about my brother ?
i know . you don &apos;t need him .
i was just thinking you could ,
just to have someone to bounce these ideas off of
who understands this kind of thing the way that you do --
a peer .
he might have a suggestion .
i do not need my brother !
i am not stuck ! i am thinking !
i am figuring it out !
i am right on the edge of figuring it out ,
of making the breakthrough of a lifetime !
i am this close !
my genius is flying around this room right now ,
trying to find a clear path to land on me ,
but i can &apos;t clear the runway for landing
because i can &apos;t find any quiet
because some idiot resident keeps talking to me !
i shouldn &apos;t said that
i didn &apos;t mean it . - i &apos;m tired , and i &apos;m frustrated .
i ...
i am so sorry . i just ...
this tumor is making me crazy .
edwards .
as bad as you want to get that tumor ,
that &apos;s as bad as i want to watch you get that tumor .
you &apos;re tired and frustrated and terrified , but guess what .
i don &apos;t give a damn .
you &apos;re supposed to be my mentor .
you are my mentor .
i believe in you , i look up to you , i want to be you .
that &apos;s an enormous responsibility ,
so don &apos;t call me names .
and stop pouting because you don &apos;t understand what to do .
be worthy of being believed in , of being looked up to .
or if you can &apos;t actually be worthy ,
if i am actually wasting my time ,
if there is nothing about you that is special or wise ,
for god &apos;s sake ,
at least have the decency to pretend that there is .
get it together , dr. shepherd .
get it together , dr . shepherd .
okay , bye .
bye .
hey . um , how are you ?
uh , good .
how &apos;s dr. herman ?
is she good ? is everything good ?
yeah , i mean , she &apos;s killing me with back @-@ to @-@ back surgeries but --
yeah , and amelia &apos;s plan ? you good with that ?
callie , what are you -- - what ?
i &apos;m not -- i &apos;m just checking in , okay ?
i &apos;m just ... seeing how you are and , uh , how , um ...
callie ?
well , it just seems like you and dr. herman
are getting along really , really well ,
and you used to complain that she was killing you ,
but now you &apos;re happy that she &apos;s killing you ,
and it seems like you really , really like her .
i do . actually , i do . she &apos;s great .
she &apos;s -- i mean , she &apos;s amazing . - and she &apos;s sick .
so , i @-@ i worry .
amelia &apos;s got it covered .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
i @-@ i worry about you .
i know i shouldn &apos;t .
i know it &apos;s none of my business ,
but , uh , old habits .
well , that &apos;s , um ...
thanks .
oh , i @-@ i got to go .
okay , okay .
wow , that &apos;s tall .
yeah . really big .
just so you know , the auditorium is packed .
the fire marshall actually made me move a bunch of people
out to an overflow room .
amelia .
just give me a minute .
amelia .
hang on .
you can talk to me .
you &apos;re wound pretty tight .
i just want you to know you can talk to me .
my whole career , i have been the other dr. shepherd .
he &apos;s the real one . i &apos;m the other one .
right now , this plan of mine is theoretical .
it &apos;s just talk .
but at some point ,
i am going to slice into dr. herman &apos;s brain ,
and i have this sick feeling
that when i face that tumor ,
i will discover that i am not just the other dr. shepherd ...
i &apos;m the wrong dr. shepherd .
911 ? what &apos;s going on ?
look , i know you &apos;ve been having me take the lead so i can learn ,
but you need to handle this case .
why would i do that ?
because it &apos;s emergent ,
and i &apos;ve never tried cutting umbilical bands .
first time for everything .
well --listen to me , okay ?
i &apos;m not ready to take this over yet .
doesn &apos;t matter .
stop ! stop !
you -- you &apos;re not hearing me .
it does matter . i &apos;m not ready .
and you think i am ?
you think this is easy for me ?
you think i &apos;m ready ?
i was fine . i got fine with dying .
and then you infected me with your stupid --
with shepherd and her plan
and your stupid hope .
and now it &apos;s harder than ever
to hand all this over .
i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m scared to .
and i &apos;m scared to let go of it ,
and it &apos;s all your fault , so ...
i think the very least you could do is deserve it .
take over , do well , make me not regret it .
can you do that ?
please ?
this is the part
where things get a little fast and furious .
it is arguably the most dangerous ,
most precarious portion of the operation .
it also needs to happen the fastest .
every step , every move before this
has laid the groundwork for this very moment ,
the moment where i place the radioactive seeds .
it requires precision ...
i just need to slip these shears under the band .
and accuracy and speed --
things that do not go together well .
i can &apos;t get the last band .
this grip &apos;s not flexible enough .
can you coax it through ?
mm . it &apos;s not -- no . it won &apos;t give .
you have to cut that last band .
i know .
have you tried a smaller scissor ?
mm . it &apos;s not the problem .
imagine picking up little grains of salt
while wearing oven mitts .
that is what i &apos;m doing inside somebody &apos;s brain .
hand me a glove .
what ?
somebody hand me a glove . scissors .
there &apos;s this thing that we used to do in peds .
i think it &apos;ll work .
i just need a more flexible opening ,
and i can make it out of a glove .
that &apos;s not in my notes , robbins .
are you serious ?
it &apos;s gonna work .
but once i do it ,
once i place the final seed ,
well ...
it &apos;s smooth sailing .
did you see that ? !
it worked ! it -- it -- it absolutely worked !
&apos;night , &apos; night , tumor baby .
it has been lovely ,
but we are done .
i &apos;d like to open things up to a few questions .
yes .
are you nervous ?
i &apos;d be crazy not to be .
yes , of course i &apos;m nervous , but i &apos;m also very excited .
this is history .
this surgery will be history .
how could i not be excited about that ?
excellent , excellent .
you should be very proud of yourself .
close up now .
where are you going ?
what you &apos;re describing is seven different surgeries
all using the hardest techniques you &apos;ve ever tried .
how long do you anticipate the entire surgery actually taking ?
18 hours ... give or take some hours .
uh , follow @-@ up question --
do you need a second resident on the case ?
uh , not unless edwards is planning to bail on me .
you planning to bail , edwards ?
no , ma &apos;am .
yes , in the back .
will you have help ?
um ... sorry ?
well , i &apos;m just , uh --
well , are you gonna be doing this whole surgery yourself ,
or is derek -- uh , dr. shepherd coming ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m just asking .
i mean , given everything , is it a good idea ?
should you be doing this yourself ?
well , i am , so ...
next question .
i need you to scan me .
something &apos;s happening . i &apos;m experiencing symptoms --
fuzziness around the edges , a little like , uh , blinders ,
and it &apos;s , uh , dark -- darker than it should be , i think .
okay .
let &apos;s go .
bailey ?
where &apos;s dr. herman ?
she stepped out . what do you need ?
uh ... it &apos;s glenda castillo .
hey , i need herman right now .
glenda castillo &apos;s baby is in distress ,
and glenda is severely hypertensive ,
showing signs of heart failure .
we need to operate on her immediately ,
so if you could finish up ...
what are you doing ?
why are you standing there ? i--
arizona .
oh , god .
it &apos;s time .
now ?
i &apos;m gonna go ...
get an o.r. ready .
okay .
okay .
you ready f @-@ for this ?
a @-@ amelia .
i &apos;ll get an o.r. prepped .
you &apos;ll inform the patient ?
oh . robbins .
surgery &apos;s all finished ?
yeah .
i see .
shepherd &apos;s prepping the o.r. ?
yes .
if i had to guess ,
i &apos;d say the tumor &apos;s invaded the optic chiasm .
my chariot awaits .
a little privacy , guys ?
did you , uh , need me for something -- a patient ?
um , yeah .
glenda castillo &apos;s baby has hydrops .
mom is mirroring , and she &apos;s going into chf .
looks like a big day for both of us .
what you need to do first
is try to embolize the vessels fetoscopically .
make sure her blood pressure is stabilized .
she has you .
amelia has you .
this is the point where you trust her , okay ?
don &apos;t go in without checking glenda &apos;s platelet counts
and crossmatching .
this is the point where you trust her , okay ?
all set .
don &apos;t let glenda &apos;s platelet count drop below --
100 . i know .
will you tie me ?
yeah .
let &apos;s do this .
i never placed much value
in wondering about an afterlife .
my concern was always this life ,
what would i do with it ?
how would i make my mark ?
be sure , be fast . you don &apos;t have half the time you imagine .
try to ablate all the vessels , but don &apos;t wait too long .
don &apos;t be afraid to make that call .
if she &apos;s awake , she &apos;ll tell you for the 15th time
to save her child &apos;s life before hers .
listen to her , let her say her piece ,
then you do what needs to be done .
i don &apos;t think -- i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t know --
i don &apos;t know if i can do this .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do this .
you can .
nicole .
you will .
let &apos;s get you inside now , okay ?
i wanted to break new ground .
i wanted to leave a legacy .
i wanted my life , my brain , my existence ...
to mean something .
you &apos;re gonna be fine , okay ?
amelia &apos;s got this . you &apos;ve got this .
the thing that i never really thought about , though ,
the thing i never really wrapped my brain around
until now was ...
wait , robbins .
no .
don &apos;t you dare .
don &apos;t you dare say it , nicole .
in order to do that , in order to be remembered ,
in order to leave something significant behind ...
time to go .
you have to leave .
dr. harmon &apos;s going in now ?
i thought she had another month .
i &apos;ll get the o.r. prepped .
you &apos;ll inform the patient .
you ready ?
start the clock please .
this is the point of no return .
how long have we been at it ?
she needs to move faster .
