hello ?
hello ? hello ?
oh , man .
what happened to your face ?
dude , somebody barbecued the side of your head .
you look crazy .
geez , how am i gonna explain this ?
oh , mickey , that outfit is so you .
glad to see you &apos;re finally
reigning in those man @-@ boobs , bro .
you know what this means , though , right ?
i hooked up last night .
so where &apos;s the lucky girl ?
well , if she hooked up with you looking like that ,
she &apos;s probably in therapy .
no , no , no , no .
get away , get away .
last night must have been epic .
i don &apos;t remember anything .
hi . yeah , room 1710 .
coffee , black .
two pots .
yeah .
as fast as you can .
thanks .
man , i got first dibs on the shower .
you &apos;re finally gonna take a shower ?
i think we &apos;ve seen some serious personal growth on this trip .
eat me .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m seeing if we took any cool pics .
that &apos;s photographic evidence , dude .
you got to erase that stuff right away .
guys !
guys , get in here !
who is she ?
why are you looking at me ?
i don &apos;t know who she is .
well , think , think .
i &apos;ve never seen her before in my life .
how do you know ?
you don &apos;t even remember what happened last night .
well , i think i would remember killing the girl .
i think i &apos;d remember that , jake .
i @-@ i &apos;d remember that , too .
oh , you know what ?
check her pockets , and let &apos;s see if she &apos;s got i.d.
i &apos;m not touching her .
or wait a second .
how do we even know she &apos;s dead ?
no , mickey , she &apos;s sleeping , okay ?
she was born with the hole in her head .
this is ... this is insane .
we need to call the cops right now .
oh , and tell them what ?
&quot; oh , guys , can you come pick up this dead girl
that happens to be in our room ? &quot;
they &apos;re gonna think we did it
or had something to do with it .
room service .
we have to answer it .
don &apos;t . no , no , no .
he &apos;ll just leave it at the door .
dude , they have a key .
if we don &apos;t answer , they &apos;re gonna let themselves in .
aloha . beautiful morning .
i have that fresh coffee you ordered .
great . i &apos;ll take it .
i can set it up for you .
no , no , no , i got it . it &apos;s not necessary .
thank you very much .
aloha and shaka , brutha .
you got everything you need , huh ?
maybe you &apos;d like a pastry with that ?
come on , come on , man .
i @-@ i can &apos;t think without my morning coffee .
you know that .
well , pound it .
we got a serious problem here .
oh , no , she knows , she knows .
how does she know ?
because she knows everything , man .
send it to voice mail .
no , i can &apos;t do that .
then she &apos;s really gonna know something &apos;s wrong .
something is wrong .
there &apos;s a dead chick floating in our freaking beer cooler .
good boy .
all right , all right , all right , all right .
what &apos;s the plan ?
got the concept , brutha ?
yeah , i pitched you the concept .
i know , but i refined it .
&quot; kamekona &apos;s personal guarantee .
15 @-@ minute delivery , or your grinds are free . &quot;
i think 30 minutes makes more sense .
plus , it &apos;s the industry standard .
everybody does 30 minutes .
but if we want to survive in this competitive market ,
we got to make a splash .
so ride like the wind ,
&apos;cause you &apos;ve got 14 minutes .
you said 15 .
you wasted 60 seconds arguing my business strategy .
and remember the company policy .
if those grinds don &apos;t get delivered on time ,
proceeds come straight out of your pocket .
seriously ?
you said you wanted to move up the corporate ladder ,
i &apos;m giving you your shot .
you know where you &apos;re going ?
yeah , i got it .
cortana , how long will it take me
to get to 42352 makaloa street ?
it &apos;ll take about 12 minutes
to drive to 42352 makaloa street .
it &apos;s about six miles away .
you and your girlfriend .
you better hurry .
cortana , a little driving music , please .
here &apos;s your driving playlist .
see you later , pops .
what ?
&quot; pops . &quot;
turn left 150 yards ahead .
no ! no , i &apos;m not getting in !
no ! stop !
please stop !
let go of me !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
no , no , no .
help !
duke , what do you got ?
park ranger here noticed some suspicious activity
on the property this morning ,
discovered these three .
who are they ?
three cpas from cleveland .
claim they &apos;re here on vacation .
yeah , what are they doing all the way out here ?
take a look .
who is she ?
no idea .
what are they saying ?
not much .
figured you guys could get them to talk .
yeah , be our pleasure .
you okay , jerry ?
no , i &apos;m not okay . i &apos;m pretty freaked out right now .
all right , just relax and tell us what happened .
so i &apos;m at this light , and i see this crazy guy pull up ,
grab a girl off the street , shove her in his car .
i had to do something ,
so i tail him for a couple blocks ,
lose him for about a minute ,
then , boom , i round the corner , and i find this .
i thought you said the guy abducted the girl .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
so where is she ?
you know how many dead bodies i saw
before i started hanging out with five @-@ 0 ?
that would be none .
nada .
zero .
and the fun doesn &apos;t stop there .
i mean , let &apos;s not forget
being accused of robbery , being abducted ,
having my life &apos;s work stolen ,
and , oh , yeah , then there &apos;s that chinese spy
who broke into my house and tried to off me .
yeah , we appreciate everything you &apos;ve done for us , jer .
so where &apos;s the love ?
the aloha ?
a badge would be nice .
all right , so , uh , hpd canvassed the area .
no sign of the girl .
i don &apos;t get it .
if it was self @-@ defense , why would she run ?
well , this might be why .
here &apos;s our vic , william malo , 30 .
he &apos;s local .
hpd responded to multiple domestic disputes at his house
in the last year , but no charges were filed .
okay , so maybe it &apos;s a husband @-@ and @-@ wife thing
that went to the next level .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
so this is his wife .
is that the woman you saw , jerry ?
no , that &apos;s not her .
well , if she &apos;s not the wife , then who is she ?
i don &apos;t know who she is ,
and i don &apos;t know how she got in that tub .
but i do know we didn &apos;t kill her .
oh , you do know that , do you ?
&apos;cause you just told me you don &apos;t remember anything
from last night .
well , yeah , th @-@ that &apos;s true , but ...
but @-@ but @-@ but what ?
all right , well , maybe i did say that .
so you &apos;re saying it &apos;s possible you did kill that girl .
no , look ...
i don &apos;t know , okay ?
i just don &apos;t know .
we came over here for a boys &apos; weekend , all right ?
you got to believe me , man , we &apos;re good guys .
&quot; good guys &quot; ?
good guys ? you &apos;re a bunch of married , 40 @-@ year @-@ old guys
come all the way to hawaii
for spring break to hit on college girls .
i mean , you must have very understanding wives .
babe , i miss you , too .
relax , all right ?
we &apos;ll be careful .
it &apos;s not our first time hunting together .
uh , i already told you-- wild boar .
yeah , that &apos;s what they hunt here in hawaii .
they &apos;re all over the place .
yeah , the , uh ... the @-@ the little ...
the little piggies with the tusks .
look , you &apos;re probably married , right ?
so , you know how it is .
no ! i don &apos;t .
we were getting stale .
just crunching numbers .
and @-@ and sitting in a cubicle watching our lives pass us by .
in cleveland !
and @-@ and @-@ and jake said that we needed to do something .
you know , something crazy to get our mojo back .
boom !
mm , all right .
say good @-@ bye ! good @-@ bye !
all right , guys , come on , huh ?
huh ? to good times !
all right .
oh , and to lots of sex with women who are not our wives .
jake said if we flashed a little cash ,
you know , scoring with these college chicks
would be like shooting fish in a barrel .
shoot ... ? or @-@ or it ended up being shooting
a girl in the head in the bathtub .
okay , i get it .
bad choice of words .
okay . listen , dopey .
uh , we found guns in your room .
it was part of the ruse for the wives , okay ?
they never came out of the case .
well , somebody in that room fired that shot !
why would we kill a girl that we don &apos;t even know ? !
why would a girl you don &apos;t even know
have your hotel key in her pocket ?
and how many room keys will you be needing ?
18 .
18 ?
it &apos;s a numbers game .
the more lines you throw out in the water ,
the better chance you have of catching a fish .
everyone knows that .
okay , here &apos;s what i think .
um , i think that one of you guys
brought the girl to your room and , uh ,
it didn &apos;t go the way you wanted it go ,
feelings got hurt , and she ended up shot .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s what i think .
no way ! that &apos;s not what happened ! no !
you guys need to work on your alibi .
all right ? you &apos;re gonna kill somebody , you need an alibi .
you literally just
told me you were too drunk
to remember anything from last night .
what if you don &apos;t remember
killing that girl ?
no .
i ... i would remember that !
all right , explain something to me-- if you are innocent ,
then why is it that you went all the way up
to the crater to try to dispose of this body ?
why didn &apos;t you just call the police ?
we were scared !
of losing our jobs .
getting caught by our wives !
look , man ...
you got to believe me , all right ?
i &apos;d give anything to remember what happened last night .
anything .
clearly , the broken nails indicate
your victim struggled with her attacker before she died .
she also has defensive bruising along the forearms .
hmm . i tell you , doc , i don &apos;t get it .
i never could understand this spring break thing .
these parents send their kids off on their own dime
to drink and use drugs and possibly
end up like this young lady .
well , you do understand it is a time @-@ honored tradition
among most american college students .
including myself .
well ... all due respect , doc ,
you don &apos;t seem like the kind of guy that &apos;s gonna end up
sucking jell @-@ o shots off some girl &apos;s belly .
that is correct .
however , there was an incident in cancún ,
spring of &apos; 94 , that involved a bottle of absinthe ,
a regrettable tattoo and 48 hours in a mexican prison .
i don &apos;t think i want to know any details .
nor would i care to elaborate .
yeah , let &apos;s just , uh , move on .
so , can you tell me anything else about this young lady ?
t.o.d. was between midnight 2 : 00 a.m.
ballistic evidence recovered from her body
had no matches in ibis .
however , i did discover traces of glitter in her hair
and on both of her shoes .
well , she could &apos;ve picked that up anywhere .
a bar or a party or something ?
or perhaps neither .
tox screen suggested there was no signs
of alcohol or drugs in her system .
however , the same test on our three suspects
told a very different story .
in addition to the copious amounts of alcohol ,
our three gentlemen showed high dosages of ketamine--
more commonly known as special k-- in their system .
with that high of a dosage , it is quite plausible
that they had no recollection of the entire night
as well as the moments prior to taking those drugs .
well , then i guess maybe curly , larry and moe are telling the truth .
the nose is a little flatter and wider .
and , uh , the cheekbones are more pronounced .
you did it . that &apos;s her .
all right , thanks , chen .
we &apos;ll take it from here .
let &apos;s run it through facial rec .
right there !
that &apos;s her !
natalie morris
wanted by the fbi for kidnapping and sex trafficking charges .
yeah , it looks like her thing is
luring young girls over from latin america
with the promise of lucrative modeling contracts .
once they enter the country using temporary work visas ,
they disappear .
okay , now i get why she &apos;d run .
but why would william malo
a guy with no criminal record
just try to grab her off the street in broad daylight ?
where the hell are you ?
i called your room ten times !
pick up the damn phone ,
you selfish son of a bitch !
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have let you go .
wild boar , my ass !
enjoy yourself , jackass .
because this will be the last trip you ever take !
you hear me ? !
i swear to god you are so on the couch when you get home !
really seems , uh , like a catch , this lady .
uh , six messages just like that all from this morning .
is that normal ?
what do you mean ? why you asking me ?
well , you &apos;re ... divorced .
oh , i see .
you &apos;re comparing this to , uh ... me and rachel .
listen .
i hope your plane crashes
on the way back , you hairless , ball @-@ less loser !
never mind . nah .
so , i just hung up with ballistics .
our suspects &apos; rifles were no match
for the slug pulled out of the vic .
okay , uh , they still could &apos;ve dumped
the murder weapon before they dumped the body .
yeah , but this girl was executed .
one shot to the head .
according to max &apos;s tox screen ,
these boys were so polluted
they &apos;d have to empty a whole clip just to hit
the side of a barn .
all right , let &apos;s just say for a minute
they didn &apos;t do it , all right ?
the vic still had their room key in her pocket ,
which means at some point during the night
their paths had to have crossed , right ?
well , the last thing they remember is going to some club
called the sand fiddler at 9 : 00 p.m.
max puts the time of death between midnight and 2 : 00 a.m.
all right . well , we need to retrace their steps ,
try to figure out what happened in between .
we &apos;ve been here for three minutes--
i &apos;ve already seen six felonies .
seven .
promise me one thing , buddy .
just promise me gracie will get her college degree online .
done .
why would you even bring up her name here ?
hello .
hi .
how &apos;s it going ?
hi . i &apos;m guessing you guys aren &apos;t here for the beer pong ,
panty jam this afternoon .
the beer ... no , no .
i don &apos;t know if i want to know what that is .
no , you probably don &apos;t .
were you , uh ... were you working here last night ?
i haven &apos;t left since tuesday .
what can i do for you ?
i was wondering if you could , uh , tell us , please ...
you see these guys hanging around at all ?
no . i don &apos;t remember seeing any parents here last night .
that &apos;s ... okay .
what about her ?
she &apos;s dead .
yeah , she is .
i &apos;m sorry to have to show you this ,
but do you remember seeing her here last night ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you sure you didn &apos;t see her ?
take a look around .
after a while , they all start to look the same .
yeah . okay .
sorry i couldn &apos;t help you .
tonight on fugitive profiles ,
the fbi is asking for your help in capturing
a dangerous fugitive from justice .
her name , natalie morris .
this episode aired last night .
okay . so it looks like our victim william malo
saw natalie on tv , tried to be a hero ,
but she turned the tables and took him out . hmm .
i always thought these shows
were scripted propaganda created
by huge media conglomerates to brainwash the l.i.v. &apos; s .
low @-@ information viewers .
they scare the unwitting public into demanding more police
on the street and then use it as an excuse
to raise taxes to feed the beast
that is uncle sam .
got it .
apparently , that is not the case .
but natalie can &apos;t be too happy
about her 15 minutes of fame .
yeah .
i &apos;ll reach out to the fbi ,
see if she had any known associates on the island ,
someone she might have reached out to for help .
okay .
l.i.v. &apos; s .
yeah .
i remember those guys . they tipped .
and that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s memorable ?
during spring break , it is .
and they were old . like , at least 40 .
sorry .
okay , do you remember anything else about these guys ?
just that they hit on every girl at the bar at least once .
i love your bikini .
thanks .
it would look great on the floor of my
crazy @-@ expensive hotel suite .
i &apos;m sure .
right next to your adult diaper .
it &apos;s a numbers game !
ladies , ladies .
so , uh , which one of you has the lowest standards ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m here . you know what i &apos;m saying ?
i &apos;m here . what &apos;s going on ? wait , wait .
i can turn it up , though .
all right . all right , we &apos;re cool .
hey , there &apos;s a big sale back at my room .
clothes are 100 % off .
i &apos;m serious .
i know .
was she was one of the ladies they hit on ?
i don &apos;t remember seeing her here last night .
okay , how long did these guys stick around ?
i closed their tab around 11 : 00 .
they were pretty wasted , so i called them a cab .
do you know how hard it is
to get the smell of vomit out of pleather ?
thankfully , i do not .
those clowns were out of control .
grown men acting like a bunch of drunk college kids .
all right , sir .
where did you drop them off ?
a place called the fix .
what , uh ... what happened after that ?
they ordered another round
and struck out again .
free shots for the lovely ladies !
get &apos; em ! here we go !
ladies ... come on .
they &apos;ll be back . they &apos;ll be back .
they &apos;re just doing a boomerang .
they &apos;ll come right back .
i give them &quot; e &quot; for effort ,
but after a while ,
it started to get sloppy , brah .
customers started to complain .
so i politely asked them to leave .
you guys refusing to leave , too ?
no . no . no .
come on , get him out of here .
all right , we got you , we got you .
we got to call the people . we got to call the people .
you know what ? i &apos;m not leaving .
what ? no , no .
you want to get your ass kicked ?
dude we drive bmws , right ?
that punk couldn &apos;t even
get us coffee back at home !
no , no , no , let it go .
just let it ... let it go .
come on .
come on , let &apos;s go .
everybody just calm down .
jake , what are you doing ?
hey , buddy , can i borrow that ?
jake !
oh , no ! oh , no !
look out !
look out !
jake , take it easy !
come on , you big ape !
you want some of me ?
anybody hungry ?
no !
anybody hungry ?
jake !
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna
shish kabob open .
hold on ...
cops , cops !
cops !
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go ,
i chased them a few blocks ,
but i lost them around this corner .
they either ran down one of these alleys
or ducked into a club .
hang on a second .
yeah , steve .
listen , you remember that trace
that max found on our vic ?
well , i think i got an idea where it came from .
okay , thanks .
slow down .
where are we going ?
who was that on the phone ?
fbi .
multiple grand jury witnesses
testified that natalie morris was actually working
with an unidentified coconspirator :
male , six @-@ foot @-@ two , dark hair , athletic build ,
with a scar under his left eye .
sound familiar ?
same scar .
they were partners .
and with all the recent publicity ,
natalie became a liability .
so he wasn &apos;t just some good samaritan
trying to make a citizen &apos;s arrest .
he was trying to kill his partner
before she brought him down with her .
flop ! flop ! flop ! flop ! flop !
whoever lost this , come and get some !
well , imagine your drunk dad
hitting on college girls with some friends .
it was pretty hard to miss them .
were the guys hitting on this girl here ?
oh , my gosh .
wait a minute , you know her ?
that &apos;s rebecca .
rebecca .
what &apos;s rebecca &apos;s last name ?
um ... oleana .
she &apos;s @-@ she &apos;s a waitress here .
you think those guys did that to her ?
no , uh , we don &apos;t think so .
but we &apos;re trying to figure out who did .
tori , do you know if rebecca has any family here ?
her mom , but she moved to the mainland last year
and rebecca stayed behind to finish up at u of h.
what time &apos;d she leave last night ?
well , she was done early and she ...
she was out before last call at 2 : 00 .
did she leave with any of the guys that we showed you ?
no . no , they @-@ they definitely tried hitting on her .
and one of them even gave her his room key ,
but ... but they were here a while after she left .
okay , wait a minute , is there any chance
that rebecca left early because
she intended on using that room key ?
no . no , never .
though rebecca said she had to get up early for something .
early for what ?
i don &apos;t know , but whatever it was ,
she seemed excited , so it must have been important .
okay .
hey , lou .
yeah ?
got a letter here for rebecca from a lawyer .
&quot; dear rebecca oleana :
after an exhaustive investigation , mr. garvey
has good reason to believe that he is your biological father .
unfortunately , his health is deteriorating rapidly .
it is his sincerest hope that you would be
open to meeting with him in the very near future .
please contact this office at your earliest convenience
so the proper arrangements can be made to finally
bring the two of you together . &quot;
it &apos;s postmarked three days ago .
well , no wonder she was so excited .
she was about to meet her father for the first time .
three months ago ...
my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer .
the last few days have been really rough .
doctors say he can pass at any time .
i think the only thing that &apos;s kept him hanging on
was his hope of meeting rebecca .
look , if you don &apos;t mind my asking ,
why were they estranged to begin with ?
look , i just found this out myself .
he had an affair 20 years ago .
he didn &apos;t want it to destroy the family ,
so financial arrangements were made with the mother .
he said ...
it was his biggest regret .
that he was ashamed of turning his back on his daughter .
he wanted to make it right , so ...
i promised that i would find her before he passed .
and you did ?
i spoke to her on the phone .
i thought she &apos;d be so angry , but she wasn &apos;t .
she just , you know , wanted to meet us ,
make up for lost time .
what about the lawyers ?
did they find anything that you think might help us
figure out why she was murdered ?
no .
by all accounts , she was a great kid .
i &apos;m happy to put you in touch with
the private investigator who found her .
yeah , thank you .
i don &apos;t know what to tell him .
maybe it &apos;s just ... better to let him hope
she might still be coming .
hpd searched malo &apos;s place .
looks like natalie stopped by to change ,
load up and grab some cash .
means she &apos;s on the move .
everywhere &apos;s locked down . big brother &apos;s watching .
there aren &apos;t a lot of places for a fugitive to hide out .
actually , there might be .
malo had several legitimate business holdings ,
including a small company called island spirit coffee .
the coffee is farmed on the island of hawaii .
check this out .
now i know what the middle of nowhere looks like .
that &apos;s the kind of place you &apos;d go to lay low
after being outed on national television .
can i help you ?
we need to talk to your boss .
it &apos;s not a good time right now .
the owner of the company just passed away .
well , tell him that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
put the phone down .
don &apos;t do it !
well , we &apos;re in the right place .
clear .
anybody in there ?
stay back .
fbi said natalie and malo
were running a sex @-@ trafficking ring .
this is a slave @-@ labor camp .
we &apos;re looking for this woman .
do you recognize her ?
no entiendo .
? donde está ?
no está aquí .
she &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s her !
cover me .
hey , what do you got ?
so i &apos;ve been looking over the footage
at the bar where our victim worked .
look at this .
okay , so she , uh ... she left the club alone .
uh @-@ huh , that &apos;s what i thought .
but look closer . look at this guy .
this creep .
this guy shows up an hour before the end of rebecca &apos;s shift ,
he does not speak to anybody ,
he does not order a drink .
zoom in .
what , you know this guy ?
oh , yeah .
look , raymond , here &apos;s the thing .
your dad , he wasn &apos;t perfect .
but he had a conscience .
he wanted to do the right thing .
but you , you didn &apos;t care about that .
the only think you cared about was his bank account .
look , $ 20 million is a lot of money , okay ?
and he is gonna give some of that to rebecca .
i imagine you weren &apos;t too , uh , too keen on that idea ,
seeing as you thought you were an only child
just a couple weeks before , right ?
i &apos;m thinking , i &apos;m figuring
at some point , you must have gone to her
and @-@ and tried to talk her out of meeting with him .
maybe ... maybe you offered her some cash ,
but she didn &apos;t care about the money , did she ?
she just wanted to meet her dad .
you know what ?
you guys forgot to read me my rights ,
so let me help you out with that .
i have the right to remain silent .
anything i say can and will be used against me
in a court of law .
i have a right to an attorney ,
and since i can definitely afford one ,
one will not have to be provided for me ...
listen , you idiot , you murdered your own sister , all right ?
with these rights in mind ,
i would prefer not to speak to you at this time .
okay , uh , let me wrap it up for you , then , okay ?
okay , go ahead .
she knew you were following her when she left that club .
she was scared , so she ducked into that hotel
where you continued to follow her .
please , help me !
please !
please , anyone !
anyone , please !
please !
please , please .
interesting story .
can &apos;t wait to see you prove it .
rebecca put up a bit of a struggle with you ,
didn &apos;t she ? a bit of a fight ?
you see , uh , the medical examiner ,
he &apos;s a buddy of mine , and , uh ...
i happen to know that he found dna ...
... underneath rebecca &apos;s fingernails .
and i &apos;m pretty sure
that it got there when she struggled with you .
i &apos;m no scientist ,
but i @-@ i &apos;m pretty sure i know what &apos;s gonna happen
when they compare it to yours .
that money was mine .
it belonged to me .
yours ?
that money was yours ?
well , guess what , buddy . now ...
no one is gonna get that money .
last thing i thought we &apos;d be doing
is going home with a criminal record .
yeah , well , going home
with a hindering prosecution charge is still better
than bringing home an std .
i don &apos;t even know what to do with that .
all right , listen , i got some advice
for you three dimwits .
you better act like choirboys
for the next three years of your probation .
otherwise , you &apos;re gonna find yourself
back here at halawa prison ,
doing the warden &apos;s taxes .
okay , then bye .
okay , thank you .
hey , wait , h @-@ hang on a second .
hang on , hang on .
i was gonna mail them back to your brides .
but i figure you got enough trouble
waiting for you on the other side , so ...
thank you .
thank you , sir .
th @-@ thank you .
i appreciate that .
yeah , thank you very much .
go home .
hug your wife , kiss your kids .
and i don &apos;t give a damn if you win a sweepstakes
with a free trip with all accommodations--
don &apos;t come back here .
thank you .
thank you .
i mean ever .
shaka , brutha .
big day for you , jer .
jerry , looking sharp , babe .
i dig the suit .
you look good .
it &apos;s a rental .
ah , come on , now .
hey , man , don &apos;t be nervous , okay ?
you deserve this . what you did was really brave .
thanks , kono .
gabriel left these photographs at your house ?
you talk to kono ?
no , you &apos;re the only one .
look , chin , gabriel &apos;s a convicted killer , all right ?
i mean , he &apos;s not exactly reliable .
what if he , uh ... what if he doctored these pictures ?
he could be trying to play you against your cousin &apos;s fiance .
it &apos;s a good point , but these pictures have been authenticated .
they &apos;re real , and they were taken recently .
what about the guy with adam ?
we , uh ... we get a positive i.d. on him ?
no , not yet . but if gabriel wants me to see these ,
i &apos;m guessing i &apos;m not gonna like him .
there he is . here &apos;s the hero .
look at you , buddy .
you look great .
congrats , jer . everyone &apos;s really proud of you .
i &apos;ll take that badge now .
ah , pump your brakes , now , superman .
we &apos;re not that proud .
hang in there .
good things come to those who wait .
hey , uh , we better get a seat over there in front of the podium .
it &apos;s starting to fill up .
go get &apos; em .
you all right ?
good luck , buddy . everything will be fine .
thanks for coming down .
i assume there &apos;s no hard feelings .
water over the bridge .
actually ...
that &apos;s mighty big of you .
after much personal reflection ,
i &apos;ve decided to forgive the monetary debt
incurred by the failed delivery ,
and any future transgressions of the same nature .
thanks . i really appreciate that , boss .
no problem .
i &apos;m just going to need a small favor in return .
honolulu is a small , close @-@ knit community .
we care about each other .
no one typifies that type of spirit more than mr. jerry ortega .
his heroic actions directly led to the capture
of two of the fbi &apos;s most wanted fugitives .
for that selfless act of courage ,
it is my honor to bestow upon him
the honolulu police department &apos;s civilian medal of valor .
