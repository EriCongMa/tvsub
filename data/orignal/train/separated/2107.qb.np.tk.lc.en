the king &apos;s hair game was flawless .
i mean , amazing .
look at that suit .
white shirt , white pants
and a red lei .
two people on this earth could pull that off , okay ?
i &apos;m the other one , so you know .
what &apos;s up ?
stan &apos;s coming home tomorrow night .
i have to tell him .
good .
go ahead , take it .
i don &apos;t understand , chief .
i thought you wanted to talk about my uncle .
the situation with your uncle keako is an unfortunate one ,
but the way you handled it , through all
the false accusations about stealing that money ,
showed character .
so now that the case is closed and your record &apos;s clear ,
hpd would like to reinstate you .
at the rank of lieutenant .
lieutenant ?
but i was only a detective at the time i resigned .
yes , but if you had never left ,
you would &apos;ve been lieutenant by now .
think of it as restitution .
i truly appreciate the offer , sir ,
but we &apos;re doing great work over at five @-@ o.
that &apos;s my home now .
how &apos;s it , duke ?
how &apos;s it , chin ?
what you got there ?
oh .
local ranch owner out in waipahu called in a report .
said he was on his atv tooling around his property
and he found what looked like pieces of burnt money .
really ? how much ?
don &apos;t know .
but it took four officers half a day to collect it all .
we &apos;re going to run the pieces
that still have the serial numbers intact ,
try to figure out where it came from .
that &apos;s impossible .
kono and i both saw that money burn .
not all of it , apparently .
once hpd starts checking those serial numbers ,
they &apos;re going to know that that money was stolen
from the asset forfeiture locker .
okay , maybe ,
but there &apos;s no hard evidence that traces it back to us .
and besides , technically , the money &apos;s all there .
somebody returned the money ,
the exact amount that we stole , remember ?
... hpd has shown improvements
across the board in every district .
perfect .
aloha , steve .
inspector kelly .
aloha , governor . morning .
miss hills .
detective kelly .
uh , you &apos;ll excuse us ?
when you going to ask her out ?
who , miss hills ?
no , the governor . who do you think ?
every time we see laura , she &apos;s sexting you with her eyes .
come on .
what , are you kidding me ?
for a great detective , you &apos;re really clueless sometimes .
hey , i was just about to call you .
guess who got another special delivery today .
another envelope .
every wednesday . it &apos;s like clockwork .
no unknown prints .
i already checked . security just dropped it off a few minutes ago .
i guess it showed up early this morning in the mailroom .
same handwriting , same ink , same envelope as all the rest .
the skeleton key .
this thing drove me crazy .
i tried every lock in the house ,
even tried dad &apos;s old desk at hpd .
you remember ? didn &apos;t fit .
didn &apos;t fit anything .
actually , um , based on the photos of all the evidence
that your father collected , i did a little digging .
turns out , that key belongs
to a piece of antique american furniture from the 1800s .
my father never owned anything like that .
then , whose key is it ?
maybe the person he was investigating .
violent crimes is down seven percent ,
property crimes down four ,
and the year @-@ to @-@ year clearance rate is up eight .
looks like your five @-@ o task force is making an impact .
yes , but let &apos;s not sell hpd short .
they &apos;ve been doing great work .
make sure you give the commissioner an &quot; attaboy &quot;
for me when you see him .
yes , ma &apos;am .
oh , and , laura , it &apos;s perfectly all right
for a lady to make the first move .
i &apos;m sorry ?
inspector kelly .
call him .
today .
yes , ma &apos;am .
laura ! laura !
laura !
governor .
what happened ? are you hurt ? are you okay ?
i see a linear shaped cut in the metal
coming from the steering column .
looks like our killer used some detonating cord ,
which means that the initial blast
came from the wheel itself .
that &apos;s bomb fragments ?
yeah . be careful .
you guys get anything ?
yeah , potential trace .
kaye said the bomb came from the steering wheel column .
those look like bb &apos;s from a bb gun .
no .
these are projectiles from a claymore mine .
you &apos;re absolutely right .
i found this electric blasting
cap wire attached to the car &apos;s ignition .
it &apos;s from a claymore .
i &apos;ve seen this kind
of improvised device before .
wait a second . whoa .
tell me you know who did this .
yeah .
the person who rigged this car
is the same man behind the murder of my fiance
and your parents .
it was wo fat .
the improvised explosive device
is one of wo fat &apos;s preferred ways of execution ,
especially when he &apos;s trying to send a message .
okay , wait , you think wo fat did this ?
i mean , it seems sloppy .
mm ... he &apos;s not sloppy , he &apos;s vindictive .
think about it .
you took out victor hesse and the yakuza here--
his right and left hands .
you made it personal .
yeah ? well , he &apos;s really going to be pissed when i toss
his ass in a cell for the rest of his life , isn &apos;t he ?
all right , what else do we know about this thing ?
once the ignition engages ,
approximately 700 steel balls ,
about an eighth of an inch in diameter , shoot out at around
4,000 feet per second through the interior of the vehicle--
a directional blast aimed square at the face of the driver .
it &apos;s a very personal , targeted attack .
she never felt a thing .
no , she didn &apos;t .
all right , sang min warned us that wo fat was coming ,
so targeting one of us i understand ,
but why laura hills ?
i don &apos;t know .
but our best chance at tracking wo fat
is through this explosive .
where would he get his hands on a claymore in hawaii ?
the military ?
hold on .
somebody breaks into a military base and steals a crate
full of mines , don &apos;t you think we would &apos;ve heard about it ?
no , no , no , wait a minute .
if there was a theft of military explosives ,
the police would be the last people the military would call .
they &apos;d want to keep the investigation in @-@ house .
kaye , double @-@ check with all the bases on the island ,
see if any claymores have gone missing .
sure .
i also have some contacts on the black and gray markets .
i can see if they know any of the munitions dealers here .
okay , good . chin , kono ,
you guys search laura &apos;s office .
danny and i will check the house .
there &apos;s got to be a reason hills was targeted .
door &apos;s open .
clear .
it must &apos;ve happened in the last few hours--
after hills went to work this morning .
this was definitely not a robbery .
okay , they didn &apos;t take the tv , didn &apos;t take the laptop .
they were looking for something .
look at this .
first two drawers have been yanked out , dumped on the floor .
the last one &apos;s left undisturbed .
all right .
maybe , uh ... maybe they got interrupted .
yeah .
or they found what they were looking for .
i &apos;ll call hpd , have them run prints ,
process this place .
maybe someone got sloppy .
danny .
huh ?
check this out .
okay , this may be a coincidence , all right ?
these are the exact same envelopes
i &apos;ve been getting sent .
come on .
you think laura hills was the one sending those ?
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re envelopes , steve .
what are you doing ?
getting a writing sample .
it &apos;s a match .
that &apos;s laura hills &apos; writing on those envelopes .
here , see for yourself .
full lower loop on her g &apos;s ,
along with a distinct upstroke on her t &apos;s .
only difference between the two samples
are slant and pressure . she was definitely stressed out
when she addressed these envelopes to you .
how can you tell ?
she used heavy pressure ,
which indicates she was uptight .
very serious about what she was doing .
and the letters are artificially upright--
no slant right or left .
she was trying to cover up her tracks .
yeah . laura did not want anybody to know
that she was sending me evidence from my father &apos;s toolbox .
chin and i searched her office from top to bottom .
if she had any more of his things , they weren &apos;t there .
okay , the thing i don &apos;t get is that
this evidence was stolen by the yakuza .
how &apos;d laura get her hands on it ?
maybe she worked for wo fat .
yeah , or she took it from somebody who did .
kaye , what do you got ?
i pulled a serial number
off a fragment of the claymore and tracked it down .
you were right .
it turns out there was a theft
and the military conducted their own investigation .
the mine was stolen
four years ago from a shipment that was destined for iraq .
c.i.d. investigated a defense contractor
by the name of dale o &apos;reilly ,
but never convicted him or recovered
any of the stolen shipment .
any idea where o &apos;reilly is now ?
well , hope you like it .
this is what &apos;s it &apos;s going to look like when you die .
this is your heaven .
want anything while we &apos;re here ?
new ammo belt ?
night vision goggles ?
ooh . ooh . powdered eggs .
let me tell you something ,
i &apos;d take powdered eggs over your eggs any day .
my eggs ... you love my eggs .
terrible , danny .
hello , dale .
hey , excuse me . excuse me .
dale o &apos;reilly ?
no . he &apos;s not here .
that &apos;s funny .
you must have a twin .
sorry , fellas . uh , never know
who &apos;s going to come looking for you .
know what i mean ?
yeah , i know what you mean .
like somebody who might be in the market for a ...
i don &apos;t know-- claymore mine ?
claymore mine ?
i will shoot you in the face . put it down !
hey , dale .
my eyes ! my eyes !
okay .
i &apos;ll take the pepper spray , and my buddy wants some powdered eggs .
who &apos;d you sell the claymore to ?
answer my question-- who &apos;d you sell the claymore to ?
mcgarrett !
his name &apos;s steve mcgarrett !
okay , um ...
you are definitely going down for accessory to murder .
okay , so at this point , if i could help you ,
i would say that you should try to help yourself .
okay ? just tell me who told you to say that name .
okay . was it this guy ?
was it wo fat ?
dale . dale ! come on !
we already tracked down the $ 50,000 that he paid you .
okay .
well , let me tell you something about this guy , okay ?
he used that claymore to kill a government official .
an innocent woman . someone i knew .
i &apos;m not talking to you .
not talking to you ?
not talking to him ?
that &apos;s okay .
maybe you &apos;d be willing to talk to somebody else .
dale .
you all right ?
come on , talk to me , little bro .
gary .
the lt just called me in off a recon detail .
said you were in some kind of trouble . what &apos;s going on ?
dale . you still there ?
next time you see your brother ,
it &apos;s going to be in a federal courtroom .
you &apos;re going to be charged with treason-- crimes against your country .
you &apos;re going to be branded as a terrorist ,
and your whole family &apos;s going to suffer as a consequence .
you understand me ? your brother gary--
he &apos;s going to be disgraced , and he &apos;s going to be forced to leave the service ,
all because you wouldn &apos;t open your mouth today .
nice work .
between the claymore and o &apos;reilly &apos;s testimony ,
we have wo fat cold .
yeah , now all we have to do is find him .
i just got off the phone with the crime lab .
they finished processing laura hills &apos;s house .
they find any other prints besides hers ?
they found prints all over the place-- mcgarrett &apos;s .
how is that possible ?
you ever been there before today ?
no , never .
somebody sure as hell wants hpd to think you were .
why ?
you &apos;re being set up .
again , i am so sorry for your loss .
i know .
we are all still in shock here .
laura was a very special girl .
oh , of course . of course .
if we learn anything , you &apos;ll be the first to know .
okay .
mahalo .
laura &apos;s parents .
they were in new york celebrating their aniversary .
we &apos;re very sorry , ma &apos;am . that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s an extremely difficult call to make .
please tell me you have something .
we do .
we know who killed laura .
his name is wo fat .
he &apos;an international arms dealer with deep ties
to the japanese yakuza . he also has connections
to the local branch here in hawaii .
and why do you think he had something to do with laura &apos;s death ?
because we have a guy in custody right now
who sold wo fat the explosives responsible for her death ,
and he made a positive i.d.
soon as he sits with an attorney ,
he &apos;s going to give us a full statement
in exchange for leniency .
hpd &apos;s taking him to jail right now .
very good work , gentlemen .
so how close are you to finding this wo fat ?
we are not close enough .
well , we &apos;re still piecing some things together , uh ,
but if it &apos;s okay with you , uh , we &apos;d like to ask you
a couple questions about laura .
of course . i &apos;ll do anything i can to help .
okay . uh , did she ever mention the name
wo fat to you ?
no .
what about her behavior ?
uh , recently ... anything off or strange ?
strange ? no .
she was the same laura i always knew .
tell me ...
why do you think she was murdered ?
we &apos;re not sure , but we &apos;re , uh ... we &apos;re working on that .
you know what , ma &apos;am ? thank you so much for your time today .
we understand it &apos;s been a very difficult day .
steve .
this is very personal to me .
you find this man--
by any means necessary .
yes , ma &apos;am .
thank you .
thank you .
what &apos;s with you ?
he can &apos;t hear us .
all right , let &apos;s go .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
why didn &apos;t you tell the governor about
the envelopes laura hills was sending you ?
did you see the bureau in her office ?
early american , 1800s , brass fixtures ?
oh , yeah , it was beautiful .
what are you , the host of antiques roadshow ?
no . looking at furniture ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what if the brass key
that laura hills sent me fits that lock ?
i don &apos;t know . what are you getting at ?
i think the governor &apos;s hiding something .
when did you get so uptight ? will you relax ?
i &apos;ll be in and out in two minutes .
relax ?
two minutes . you &apos;ll be ... there &apos;s security all over that place .
always .
let me tell you something ,
what are you talking about ?
all right ?
the governor has a press conference in a couple hours .
i &apos;ll make my move then . it &apos;ll be fine .
okay . let me just make a statement , okay ?
out of the top ten
dopiest suggestions you have ever had ,
this is number one with a bullet .
what idea is that ?
oh , i &apos;ll tell you .
he , uh ... he wants to break into the governor &apos;s mansion .
what ?
all those who think that &apos;s a certifiably demented idea ,
please raise your hand .
please raise your hand .
i &apos;m new . i didn &apos;t think i got a vote .
you don &apos;t get a vote .
okay , and the rest of you are forgetting
that five @-@ o is not a democracy ;
it &apos;s a benevolent dictatorship . got it ?
why would you want to break into the governor &apos;s mansion ?
the key that laura hills sent me from my father &apos;s tool box
goes to an old antique bureau .
all right ? the exact same
antique bureau that &apos;s in the governor &apos;s study .
okay , if the key fits ...
what do you think you &apos;re going to find in there ?
the rest of my father &apos;s stuff .
mcgarrett .
wait , wait , wait . what ? what ? what ?
when ?
all right , we &apos;re on the way .
what happened ?
that was hpd .
the transport taking o &apos;reilly to prison just got hit .
two good cops-- dead .
yeah .
and the only witness we had
against wo fat . how did he know , huh ?
how did he know ? how did this happen ?
come here , come here , come here , come here .
come here . come here .
relax . come here . relax .
stop . talk to me for a second .
okay , you think wo fat did this ?
you kidding me ?
no .
this had to be a leak , danny .
okay , all right . but it &apos;s not hpd .
okay ? they knew o &apos;reilly was going to be a witness ,
but they did not know he was going to testify against wo fat .
nobody knew that except us .
the governor .
outside of five @-@ o , the governor was the only person
that knew that o &apos;reilly could i.d. wo fat .
the governor , steve ?
work with me here , okay ?
a month ago , we walk in ,
she &apos;s having lunch with hiro noshimuri .
hiro noshimuri , the head of the yakuza ,
apparently an &quot; old friend &quot; of hers .
the governor &apos;s in his pocket .
shh . okay . let &apos;s stop and think about what you are saying .
what are we talking about ?
we are talking about the governor .
she &apos;s only the top elected official in the state .
i don &apos;t care .
if she did this , she goes down .
okay , but you realize that this
is an accusation of monster proportions . i &apos;m just ...
massive proportions , right ?
i get it . we need evidence .
we need rock @-@ solid , airtight proof .
okay . okay . okay .
okay , that &apos;s right . that &apos;s all .
now you &apos;re making sense .
okay , we can &apos;t be all bull in the china shop .
we got to use our heads , okay ? we &apos;re ... we &apos;re going to look
at all the evidence that your father collected ,
and we &apos;re going to see if it points to the governor .
it &apos;s rachel . give me two seconds .
go . go , go .
hey . listen , rachel ,
i can &apos;t talk right now , okay ?
i got to call you back .
danny , um , i need to see you .
it &apos;s important .
what &apos;s the matter ? you sound upset . you okay ?
i just need to see you . can you meet me
at the end of sand island in an hour ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be there in one hour , okay ?
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
look .
you &apos;re running on fumes right now .
okay ? i want you to go home .
get some rest . you wake up in the morning ,
we look at the evidence , we come up with a game plan .
we got to be smart about this , right ?
yeah .
right ?
right .
all right . come on .
what &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s nothing . i just need to talk to you about something .
okay .
what &apos;s going on ?
you having second thoughts about telling stan ?
no .
that &apos;s not it at all .
hey , listen to me .
whatever it is , you can tell me , okay ?
anything . i &apos;m right here .
i &apos;m pregnant .
you &apos;re pregnant .
wow . uh ... and i &apos;m definitely ...
yes .
okay , good . good , good , good . okay .
everything &apos;s going to be okay , honey . i promise .
how do i tell stan that i &apos;m leaving
and that i &apos;m pregnant with your child ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
i &apos;ll come with you , all right ?
no . this is something that i need to do by myself .
once it &apos;s done , i don &apos;t want to be here .
you want to leave hawaii ?
this is stan &apos;s home ; it &apos;s not mine .
i already checked with the airline .
there &apos;s a red @-@ eye to newark
that leaves tomorrow night .
all right , well , i &apos;m coming with you .
danny , you can &apos;t leave . you have a life here .
i have a ... i have a life here ?
rachel ...
you and grace are my life .
the only reason i came out here
in the first place was for you guys .
wherever you are , that &apos;s where i want to be .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to be , okay ?
what about your job ?
listen , we &apos;ll go , uh , i &apos;ll get you settled in jersey ,
and i &apos;ll come back here , i &apos;ll wrap up all my ... my cases ,
and then , uh , that &apos;s it .
all right ? it &apos;ll just be the three of us again .
all right ?
the four of us .
rachel , i love you .
i love you , too .
i should go pack .
i never unpacked , so i &apos;m good .
we &apos;re going to have another baby .
what thel is the matter with you ?
would it kill you to knock on this door just once ?
i never knock on that door .
why ? what &apos;s with the ambush ?
why are you dressed like a ninja ?
what are you doing ?
okay . what is this ?
no , no , no .
don &apos;t answer .
tell me you didn &apos;t break into the governor &apos;s house .
the key fit , danny .
this is what my father was working on
before he was murdered , danny .
he was investigating the governor .
look at this .
see for yourself .
i found these in the drawer .
that &apos;s laura hills with one of those envelopes .
is that your truck ?
that &apos;s my truck .
the governor found out
that laura was sending me pieces of evidence
from my father &apos;s toolbox . and you know what else , danny ?
i think laura was stealing the evidence from the governor .
that doesn &apos;t make sense , okay ?
why would she do that ?
why would she send you piece by piece ?
the box was full of all kinds of different stuff .
i &apos;m sure she was hoping that the governor
wouldn &apos;t notice anything missing .
come here .
this is insane .
this is laura &apos;s date book , okay ?
now , for the last month , every wednesday ,
i get something in an envelope from my father &apos;s toolbox .
all right ? okay ?
look at this . let &apos;s go back a month .
every one of laura &apos;s tuesday lunches is open .
so what ? what happens on tuesday ?
what happens on tuesday ? the governor has
a standing lunch with the chief of police
at turtle bay , and laura knew that .
so wait a minute .
so laura uses that time to slip into the governor &apos;s office ...
and steal us a piece of evidence .
and according to these photos in that bureau ,
the governor found out about it .
she had laura killed .
laura was trying to help me , danny .
it &apos;s my fault that she &apos;s dead .
so you &apos;re saying that you think
that the governor had laura hills murdered ?
yes , and wo fat made it happen .
all right , so what are we waiting for ? let &apos;s bring her in .
slow down . okay ?
we don &apos;t have any hard evidence proving anything .
but we have these photos .
yeah , we do-- that he illegally obtained
by breaking into the governor &apos;s house .
she &apos;s probably going to say
that he planted them there anyway .
yeah , he &apos;s right .
this isn &apos;t some liquor store stickup artist
who everyone wants to see locked up .
we &apos;re talking about an elected official with a spotless record
and a 72 % approval rating .
if we &apos;re going to take her down , we &apos;re going to need
something that sticks .
fine . that &apos;s our focus now , okay ?
we silently investigate the governor like my father did ,
we get something on her and bring her down ,
and she leads us to wo fat .
yeah , duke , what &apos;s up ?
you sure you don &apos;t want your old job back ?
&apos;cause it looks like your current one
isn &apos;t going to exist very much longer .
we have a warrant to arrest mcgarrett for murder .
we got a problem .
hpd is on its way right now
to arrest you for killing laura hills .
kono , get everything off the screens .
wipe the drives . wipe everything .
this is ridiculous .
he &apos;s being set up .
what are you going to do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i got no honest chance of beating this
if the governor &apos;s involved . not if i &apos;m locked up .
all right , listen .
do me a favor . please just lay low .
okay , we &apos;ll get something on the governor ,
and we will end this .
i got to go .
hey , everything-- clean house .
steve mcgarrett , hold it right there .
put down your weapon .
now !
did i lose another bet i forgot about ?
i need a gun .
a what ?
you heard what i said .
i &apos;m a parolee , brah .
you know that .
and possession of a firearm can send me back to jail .
besides , you &apos;re a cop .
where &apos;s your gun ?
i &apos;m not a cop anymore .
and i need your help .
please .
come on . this way .
you never know what you &apos;re going to need until you need it .
you know what i &apos;m saying , brah ?
yeah , i know what you &apos;re saying .
do they really think that mcgarrett killed laura hills ?
right now , it doesn &apos;t matter what they think , okay ?
it &apos;s about the evidence .
it &apos;s our job to prove that he didn &apos;t do it , okay ?
i &apos;m not going to stand around here and do nothing .
what ? chin , where are you going ?
chin !
officer kalakaua ,
detective ahuna , internal affairs .
i have orders to bring you in .
i already told your friends
that i don &apos;t know where mcgarrett is .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with the mcgarrett situation .
okay , ahuna .
then , what the hell is it about ?
we got a witness that can place officer kalakaua
at the scene of a break @-@ in .
what break @-@ in ?
the hpd asset forfeiture locker .
apparently , you know about some money
that went missing recently .
officer kalakaua , i need you to come with me right now
or face charges of obstructing an investigation .
relax , okay ?
she doesn &apos;t know anything .
uh ... just keep your mouth shut .
don &apos;t say anything , okay ? we &apos;ll take care of it .
all right ? go ahead .
all right .
thanks .
oh , boy .
did she really steal that money ?
mm @-@ hmm . well , we did .
what , are you serious ?
we didn &apos;t have a choice .
all right ? it was a ransom demand .
if we didn &apos;t do it , they were going to kill chin .
so mcgarrett and kono used a sewer tunnel
to break into the locker .
that &apos;s crazy .
hmm . welcome to my world .
i like it . what do we do now ?
you like it ? that &apos;s good .
uh , you are going to watch these guys .
please . okay ?
and you ?
i &apos;m going to find mcgarrett before they do .
big guy , it &apos;s not a good time , okay ?
hold on . it &apos;s about mcgarrett .
what ? what about mcgarrett ?
i &apos;m worried about him . he just paid me a visit ,
loaded up for bear .
whoa , you gave him weapons ?
you didn &apos;t hear that from me , brah .
i don &apos;t know who he &apos;s after ,
but i thought you should know .
he &apos;s going after the governor .
come on , steve , answer the phone .
this is mcgarrett . speak .
steve .
danny , it &apos;s rachel .
hey , honey , listen , i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t talk right now , okay ?
i &apos;ll call you back .
i just wanted to let you know we &apos;re here .
you &apos;re here ? you &apos;re where ?
the airport .
is everything all right ?
yes . everything is fine .
danny , if you &apos;re having second thoughts ...
listen to me . i love you . everything is fine .
i got something to take care of ,
