there you go . a nice yummy breakfast .
hey , where &apos;s the little leprechaun ?
oh , i think he &apos;s still getting dressed .
no , on the box . this isn &apos;t our normal cereal .
well , because this is the store brand ,
but it &apos;s delicious .
okay , guess what . i just got an offer to handle a case .
good , because i think this cereal is mostly sawdust .
it is great , it &apos;s just there &apos;s , um ... slight complication .
it &apos;s for closets , closets ...
i don &apos;t like where this is going .
closets ...
don &apos;t say it .
closets .
what did you think the last word might be ?
mitchell , you can &apos;t work for your father &apos;s rival .
hey , wait . why does grandpa have a rival ?
oh , who knows ?
betrayal .
because 30 years ago ,
your grandfather &apos;s business partner
and best friend , earl chambers ,
stole his rolodex with all of his clients
and started his own company
on a day that is now known as black wednesday afternoon .
nobody calls it that .
look , i know that there &apos;s some history there ,
but can &apos;t we all just move on ?
your father hasn &apos;t .
he still crank calls earl every year
on the anniversary of the day
that is now known as black wednesday afternoon .
i really need this job .
at least tell your dad first
and spare him the pain i felt
when i found out you were still
getting your hair cut at miguel &apos;s .
wait , what did miguel do to you again ?
he recommended a shampoo for thinning hair , mitchell .
maybe we can use this to fix the loose tile in the bathroom .
hey , mr. dunphy , can we have just a moment of your time ?
come on , now . how long have we known each other ?
we should be on a first @-@ name basis .
better yet , a nickname basis , vitamin d.
glad to hear you say that ,
&apos;cause , um , we have a favor to ask you .
you know how dyl--
vitamin d has his own t @-@ shirt business ?
oh , i should &apos;ve seen this coming .
yes , i will model for you ,
but i &apos;m gonna need to own the negatives .
okay , great .
also , we were kind of hoping
that dylan could stay in the basement
with me for a little while .
he &apos;s trying to save up to build inventory ,
and rent is killing him .
it feels like they &apos;re asking for money ,
like , every six weeks .
i don &apos;t know , guys .
moving in together , that &apos;s a big step .
it &apos;s just for a little while .
please ?
i guess if your mom &apos;s okay with it , i &apos;m okay with it .
oh , um , and could you ask her for us ?
i &apos;ll give it a shot , but it &apos;ll be the second thing
i &apos;ve talked her into this morning ,
and it &apos;ll be a lot trickier now that she &apos;s fully awake .
hey , hon . do you have a minute ?
just . i can &apos;t be late to work .
we are unveiling a new closet today -- the trulhatten .
it &apos;s swedish , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s modern .
we &apos;re gonna grab ikea by the meatballs .
listen , i was talking to haley and dylan --
they want to know if he can stay
in the basement for a few weeks .
oh , phil , i think that &apos;s a bad idea .
they &apos;re adults ,
and dylan really has been getting his act together .
this doesn &apos;t bother you ?
i don &apos;t enjoy having to get your approval for everything ,
but that &apos;s the deal i made .
haley and dylan in her bedroom .
they &apos;re doing what they &apos;re doing .
i say we be evolved about it .
fine .
if you &apos;re really okay with our precious daughter
shacking up with her ne &apos;er @-@ do @-@ well boyfriend ,
so be it .
i just don &apos;t want them sneaking around like we had to .
the scariest moment of my life
was that pantsless conversation
i had with your dad through the dutch door .
how lazy are you ?
if you want to talk to us , just come downstairs .
luke , i &apos;m at college . i don &apos;t even live there anymore .
and ... you have been missed .
whatever . i &apos;ll try mom in the car .
i really need to talk to her about something .
i &apos;m here for you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
well , okay . it &apos;s sanjay .
i feel like he &apos;s been avoiding me .
i know . he &apos;s been really distant .
uh , tell me all about it .
and don &apos;t worry . take all the time you need .
well he never really texts me back anymore .
maybe i should confront him about it ?
yes ! do it !
yeah . you know what ? you are right .
i &apos;m totally going to call him right now ,
and i &apos;m going to tell him he can &apos;t treat me this way .
no , no , no .
no , no , please don &apos;t .
fine , whatever . i get it .
i &apos;ll give him some more space .
you could practice right now
and take a scootch to your right .
what ?
who are you talking to ?
my brother .
he &apos;s cute .
hi , alex &apos;s brother .
hey . i &apos;m luke .
who are you ?
brie .
i live down the hall .
just borrowing a dress . thanks , alex .
mm . bye .
bye , luke .
i @-@ i lift weights !
hey , what &apos;s up ?
manny , you and i are going to college .
you sure are , buddy .
who cares what that guidance counselor said ?
look , there &apos;s a girl in my sister &apos;s dorm
who &apos;s super into me ,
and she &apos;s got a hot roommate for you .
how hot ?
use your imagination .
holy cow .
i guess it would help take my mind off of carly .
should we talk about what color ties
we &apos;re gonna wear so we don &apos;t clash ?
click .
manny .
so , who is this carly ?
carly stevenson . she &apos;s my cheerleader ,
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;s too happy about it .
what do you mean that she &apos;s your cheerleader ?
it &apos;s a football tradition .
they pair each player with a cheerleader ,
and then they &apos;re supposed to decorate the locker ,
bake them cookies , wear their hair the way he likes it .
it &apos;s fun for everybody .
yesterday , all the other players &apos; lockers
looked like mardi gras floats .
my locker , nothing .
maybe your carly &apos;s busy ,
but i &apos;m sure she &apos;s gonna do something nice for you .
i remember my cheerleader , donna deritzio .
she got busy and did something nice for me ,
if you catch my meaning .
mitchell . you &apos;re the first to arrive .
come on , i &apos;ll make you a drink .
no , dad . i &apos;m not here for a party .
oh , good . i thought i forgot someone &apos;s birthday again .
listen , there &apos;s something i want to talk to you about .
um , i got an offer to handle a case ,
but i &apos;m a little worried about who it &apos;s for .
what &apos;s the matter now ? killing whales ?
drilling for oil ? child labor ?
&apos;cause let me tell you something .
i had a paper route when i was 7 years old ,
and you know what it gave me ?
a work ethic and a right arm like popeye .
no , dad , it --
i &apos;d be working for closets , closets , closets --
next word better not be closets .
of course it &apos;s closets !
now i &apos;m confused .
are you talking about closets , closets , closets , closets ,
or of course it &apos;s closets ?
&apos;cause roy carson &apos;s a straight shooter ,
and poor guy has a son who &apos;s not quite right .
are you really making me say this again ?
it &apos;s closets , closets --
you &apos;re not working for that
rolodex @-@ stealing earl chambers !
it &apos;s just short term , a few weeks .
you know why he &apos;s doing this ? !
because i &apos;m a good lawyer
who handled a similar case for you last year .
he &apos;s doing this to mess with me !
i was referred by another lawyer .
i doubt earl even knows about it .
that rolodex was full of a @-@ list clients .
your erik estradas , your fran tarkentons ,
your leslie uggums .
i &apos;m sorry , are these real names ?
what about that probate ? how did you mess that up ?
client &apos;s dead .
okay , this is crazy .
why am i worried about your feelings
when you obviously have no concern for mine ?
y-- i &apos;m taking that job .
西弗吉尼亚州和肯塔基州边界两个家族之间有世代血仇
it &apos;s like a hatfield working for a mccoy .
if a hatfield ever worked for a mccoy .
maybe it would &apos;ve ended that ridiculous family feud .
richard dawson !
also in the rolodex !
also in the rolodex !
hailey did you take my phone chargne again ?
what ?
do you have my charger ? !
i can &apos;t hear you . just text me .
i wish i could !
i really need you to get your own charger , honey .
oh , you &apos;re both in the bed together .
dad , it &apos;s fine .
our room is your room , philibuster .
thank you , dylan .
uh , anyway , just , uh , looking for my charger .
sorry , dad , it &apos;s not here .
guess i &apos;ll just get used to not having any power .
carly ?
carly ?
carly ?
yeah ?
i thought so .
who are you ?
i am manny &apos;s mother ,
and i want to know why
you haven &apos;t done a better job at decorating his locker .
because it &apos;s a stupid sexist tradition .
why don &apos;t the players decorate our lockers ?
that &apos;s a very good question you should have asked yourself
before becoming a cheerleader .
here .
buy yourself something pretty
and put it on my son &apos;s locker .
mrs. delgado @-@ pritchett ,
may i please see you in my office ?
okay , i want a new cheerleader for manny .
give me this yearbook and i &apos;m gonna pick one for him .
no . even if i did think that was a good idea ,
i &apos;m not gonna abuse my position of power in the school .
you share an office with a tetherball .
you have to just let nature take its course ,
just like this webcam i &apos;ve been watching .
it &apos;s a live stream of wild otters .
i forget , is it the small hairy men
or the tall not hairy men ?
small hairy , but these are actual otters . look .
see , this mama otter just gave birth to twins .
now , the little one , he &apos;s struggling ,
but do you see the mama doting on him ?
no , you do not .
well , if you ask me , she &apos;s being a terrible mother .
she should be filling him with confidence
and fish like i do to manny .
high school is difficult . it &apos;s part of the experience .
and that &apos;s not a bad thing .
learning how to handle disappointment
and overcoming adversity ,
that &apos;s part of the reason i am where i am today .
chuck , no . no , no , no . there &apos;s no more room in here .
i beg you , please !
conference room is down there .
oh , very nice .
this is mr. chambers &apos; office .
oh , he &apos;s in . let me introduce you .
earl , am i bothering you ?
nothing &apos;s bothering me . i &apos;m gonna be in time magazine .
closet time .
shut up .
this is the attorney ...
okay . all right , all right .
handling the fowler case , mitchell ...
just call me mitchell .
pritchett .
pritchett ?
mitch pritchett .
son of that son of a bitch jay pritchett ?
reporting for duty .
don &apos;t bother unpacking that briefcase .
i cannot have a pritchett hanging around here .
i got too much sensitive information
your dad would love to get his hands on .
that was a takeout menu .
i don &apos;t want that man to know where i eat .
i &apos;m just here to do a job .
i don &apos;t care what happened
between you and my dad 30 years ago .
has it really been that long ?
i was little when the whole thing started .
i used to call you uncle earl .
i remember that . you were a cute kid .
hey , did you ever solve that rubik &apos;s cube ?
i got three sides .
not bad .
what the hell ? you can stay .
maybe you working here can be the beginning
of a new chapter between our two families .
i &apos;ll tell you what , you tell your dad
if he wants to bury the hatchet , dinner &apos;s on me .
oh , really ?
absolutely .
i just wish my dad was as reasonable as you .
thank you very much . now get out of here .
i got to get my cover shot .
you &apos;re not on the cover .
shut up !
what are you two doing here ?
reaching out to a family member in distress .
you sounded pretty upset yesterday .
so , you drove all the way down here ?
that &apos;s so sweet .
hey , we &apos;re here for you .
how are you feeling ? what &apos;s new ?
where &apos;s your friend brie &apos;s room ?
down the hall to the left . just go .
do you have a steam iron ?
because i would love to give this blazer a --
hi , honey .
sorry i &apos;m so late . work was so crazy today .
from the moment i got there ,
it was just one problem after another .
but all just closet stuff , right ?
yeah .
listen , i want to apologize about the whole dylan thing .
i wasn &apos;t taking your feelings into consideration .
i know how uncomfortable you are
with him sleeping in haley &apos;s room , so ...
i think we should reconsider .
really ?
look at me .
this is as much your house as it is mine .
i know that .
let &apos;s go kick him out .
hey , guys . can we talk for a second ?
what &apos;s up ?
actually , let &apos;s sit down .
there &apos;s something pretty important we need to discuss .
okay , whoa .
this is exactly how it started out
when i found out my father wasn &apos;t really in space .
anyway , um , after some careful consideration ...
your mother has something to say .
claire , you &apos;re up .
that was the moment i realized
phil wanted me to kick dylan out
so he could be the cool one .
well , i can be cool , too .
i &apos;m cooler than cool . i &apos;m frigid .
mom , what is it ?
we were thinking about having pizza for dinner .
claire .
i know we had it a couple of days ago ,
but i &apos;m too tired to cook .
i &apos;m gonna go change my clothes .
claire , um ... honey .
that was weird .
you know what &apos;s weird ?
thinking your dad &apos;s on the moon ,
then seeing him working at the mall .
claire , what was that ?
i thought we were giving dylan the boot .
yeah , but then i suddenly realized
i &apos;m being so unfair .
you like having dylan here .
yeah , but --
honey , look at me .
this is as much your house as mine .
it is ?
now go order the pizza .
it &apos;s getting late and those two are heading off to bed soon .
oh , hey , mitchell , you &apos;re in luck .
there &apos;s room for another knife in my back .
i just came here to tell you to your face
that you &apos;re wrong about earl .
he is not that bad a guy .
i &apos;ve seen him eat a panda steak .
he is a little rough around the edges ,
but , look , he wants the rivalry to end .
never !
you know , he &apos;s not the problem .
you are . you .
so blinded by pettiness .
you can &apos;t even see when a man &apos;s extending an olive branch ,
and -- oh , my god . - what ?
i just realized there are two sides to every story ,
and who am i to discount yours ?
we should go inside and we should --
连你亲儿子都嫌你
you were saying ?
nothing . i &apos;m never saying anything ever again .
gloria ?
no .
gloria .
yes .
streamers , twinkle lights .
&quot; sexy manny &quot; ?
i hope there &apos;s a number to a good therapist in here .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
what is this ?
well , well , well .
would you look at that ?
i said to leave things alone , and what do you know ?
the cheerleader came through , so apology accepted .
what are you talking about ?
she did this because i scared her .
well , whether we were both right or just me ,
the point is things worked themselves out ,
so i think we can go home .
carly , hello .
thank you so much
for doing such a great job on manny &apos;s locker .
i haven &apos;t decorated it yet .
what ? but then who would --
well , i guess we &apos;ll never know , so ...
cameron .
okay , fine , i did it .
what happened with letting mother nature take its course
like the otters in your computer ?
the little one &apos;s dead .
what ?
the mother , she did nothing
while an eagle pecked it apart .
nature is cruel .
you decorated manny &apos;s locker ?
i decorated eight of them .
this tradition &apos;s on fumes .
董事长
all right .
so , this is it , huh ?
the rat &apos;s nest .
well , well , well , aloha , jack lord .
i remember you from my rolodex .
i &apos;m so embarrassed . i can &apos;t believe i fell for it .
well , at least you finally realized
this is not some silly rivalry .
now let me get at his cigars so i can drag my deal across it .
okay , i have to say ,
the scotch is starting to wear off
and i &apos;m having second thoughts about this plan , dad .
what &apos;s there to think about ?
you take a picture of me
dragging my deal across the cigars ,
we give him enough time to smoke them ,
and we send the photo to earl .
first of all , earl will then have a picture of you
with your pants down ,
and i &apos;ll have that same picture
in my brain for the rest of my life .
suddenly you &apos;re squeamish about seeing another man &apos;s deal ?
the man made a fool of you , mitchell !
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m overthinking it .
whip it out .
keep your deal in your pants , pritchett !
okay , does everybody call it a deal ?
how have i never heard of this ?
you &apos;ve gone too far this time , earl .
bringing my family into this .
yeah . how could you ? i trusted you .
i defended you to my father ,
and you made me look like a fool !
and all for what ? closets .
you mean the place that people start each day ,
choosing an outfit that gives them
the confidence to achieve their dreams ?
or that magical space that turns a bonus room
into a bedroom and a house into a home ?
thanks to cheap materials ,
your closets turn a house into a fire trap !
we pleaded no contest .
that is not an admission of guilt .
i &apos;m doing it . i &apos;m taking my deal out .
the hell you are ! get up ! get up !
i &apos;ll crush your skull like an egg !
and they say by the end of the semester ,
we &apos;ll know how to sequence a genome .
i don &apos;t know about genomes ,
but on my father &apos;s side of the family ,
we do have a garden gnome .
he uses a mushroom as an umbrella .
manny , you &apos;re up .
can i just say it &apos;s so amazing
spending some time with you two .
i am so sick of superficial ,
self @-@ absorbed high @-@ school girls .
oh , my god , i hated high @-@ school girls .
the worst are cheerleaders .
they used to make fun of me behind my back brace .
well , brace yourself for this .
you look hot now .
manny , you &apos;re up .
forgive my friend .
it &apos;s just that you two are so beautiful ,
it &apos;s a little intimidating .
okay .
college isn &apos;t going the way we thought .
neither of us has kissed a guy since we got here .
so ...
you mean us ?
yeah .
now ?
in accordance with campus regulations ,
you have our consent .
yes !
thank you . i &apos;ll be right back .
gum , gum , gum . i need gum .
i don &apos;t have any .
thanks .
i finally got through to sanjay .
sounds personal .
i don &apos;t want to stick my nose into your --
he broke up with me .
he &apos;s seeing someone else .
um , you probably want to be alone right now .
i am alone .
come on .
you &apos;ll be okay .
that &apos;s , uh ...
that &apos;s really all i got .
luke , hurry up .
they &apos;re starting to come to their senses .
go . it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m gonna stay with alex .
is there anything i can do ?
i don &apos;t think so .
okay , pray for me .
well , there you are .
didn &apos;t quite work out like we planned ,
but i did get that staple in his head .
you have to understand i did it for the right reasons .
i was -- i was just looking out for my family ,
but ... you &apos;re my family , too .
you know what the best part of tonight was ?
it wasn &apos;t just me against earl .
it was us against him .
i liked that .
i did too . yeah .
and i promise i will never side with anyone else ever again .
unless , of course , you &apos;re wrong ,
&apos;cause i still do have my principles .
okay .
just get out of the car .
first i have to give you this .
it &apos;s my old rolodex !
yeah . i stole it out of his office .
but how ? when ?
you guys were rolling around under that desk for about 10 minutes .
after i grabbed it , i had time to return some e @-@ mails .
thank you for this .
it &apos;s a huge deal .
that word &apos;s kind of tainted for me now , so ...
you guys cold ? i can turn up the heat ,
get you out from underneath that blanket .
we &apos;re good , l.a.p.d.
as bad as i wanted dylan out , i wasn &apos;t gonna flinch .
phil needed to do it .
he needed to be as tough as that eagle on the internet .
dumb otter never saw it coming .
oh , stop ! that tickles !
you all right , phil ?
yeah , just enjoying the movie .
oh , you are ? it &apos;s not even scary .
like , that is the lamest sea monster i &apos;ve ever seen .
that &apos;s &apos; cause you can see it .
it is way scarier if you can only imagine
what &apos;s going on beneath the surface .
that &apos;s it ! i &apos;m done !
haley , dylan ,
this little living arrangement of yours ,
it &apos;s not working out and it &apos;s about to change .
dad , why are you freaking out ?
because i &apos;m your father
and i can &apos;t have the two of you
sleeping together in the same room like it &apos;s no big deal .
so , from now on ,
you &apos;re gonna show me the respect i deserve
and sneak around behind my back .
do what , now ?
i don &apos;t understand .
starting tonight , you &apos;re sleeping in alex &apos;s room ,
and if there &apos;s any monkey business ,
better happen after i &apos;m asleep .
are you serious ? !
i &apos;m okay with that .
me too .
i &apos;m not okay with that .
i &apos;m not okay with any of that .
haley , you need to start focusing on your job .
dylan , you &apos;re moving out tomorrow .
end of discussion !
sorry . i &apos;m not the cool mom .
not the cool mom .
hey , guys , i tried .
thanks .
what are you doing in my bed ? !
waiting for your dad to fall asleep .
what is going on in here ? !
alex , why are you home ?
sanjay broke up with me .
sweetheart .
everything will be fine .
just go sleep with hayley .
