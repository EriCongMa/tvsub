nelson &apos;s sparrow
are you sure ?
it &apos;s gideon .
&quot; the bitterest tears shed over graves
&quot; are for words left unsaid
and deeds left undone . &quot;
harriet beecher stowe .
there are no fresh tire tracks . we &apos;ll keep the roadblocks going .
he &apos;s got a 3 @-@ hour head start . he &apos;s got a high @-@ powered rifle .
he shouldn &apos;t be approached without backup .
hotchner .
yeah , just tell them you &apos;re with us .
they &apos;ll let you through .
ok .
is this how it &apos;s gonna go ,
all my friends dying off ?
first erin , then harrison ,
and ... now jason .
disease is one thing , but ...
murder ?
i hadn &apos;t talked to him in years .
me neither .
how does that happen ?
back in the day , i would have bet my life
that we &apos;d always be close .
but maybe we never were .
you know , it could be that after all these years ,
i just rewrote our history .
so you guys haven &apos;t seen gideon in like 8 years ?
he didn &apos;t say good @-@ bye or anything ?
he left spence a letter .
the way to love him was to let him be .
it sounds intense .
more like passionate .
he had that reputation . i guess that &apos;s what it takes
to be one of the godfathers of the bau .
yeah , he was a legend .
i was excited . he was teaching this class
and i signed up , but he only lectured twice .
because he found the footpath killer
and came back to the unit .
i heard that &apos;s why he jumped ship .
there was always a method to his madness .
maybe because he followed his heart .
so he retired and then got into these birds ?
mm , yeah . birds have always been his thing .
i &apos;m not sure why .
graves apple farm is a mile from here .
they &apos;re his closest neighbors .
called in the gunfire at 3 : 15 .
evidence of size 10 boot .
wide tread , likely rubber sole .
between those and a high @-@ powered rifle ,
it could be anyone from around here .
he didn &apos;t leave any casings . sorry .
there &apos;s not much evidence out here .
then we &apos;ll just have to look at what he did .
he could have easily shot him from here .
it wasn &apos;t close enough . he wanted to kill him
in his own house .
wounds him first because he &apos;s a coward
and doesn &apos;t have the guts to go inside
until he &apos;s got the upper hand .
he &apos;d only feel confident if he knew he &apos;d weakened him .
he sounds like a hunter .
he wanted gideon to know who he was .
he watched , waited , and hunted him .
this is personal .
who &apos;s that ?
stephen .
oh , my god .
he &apos;s not a kid anymore .
that &apos;s the slowest i &apos;ve ever seen you type .
snooping into gideon &apos;s spending habits
makes me feel like a creep .
yeah , well , try looking through his bedroom .
oh , you win .
all right , so there was newspaper ,
a few days worth of clothes , and hotel soaps .
oh , he always did that .
he &apos;d collect them and put like money and gum
and make these little bags and keep them
in his car , give them to the homeless .
tells us he &apos;s been traveling .
a lot , according to his plastic .
mainly down the east coast .
but he came back home . so who knew that
and who would want him dead ?
we should start with recent releases .
gideon &apos;s arrested a lot of people .
thousands . he &apos;s been a crime @-@ fighter since , what , 1975 ?
yeah . 40 @-@ year sentence sounds pretty
good until the 40 years are up .
out of respect , i kept him covered .
appreciate that .
&apos;cause of death was hypovolemic shock
due to ballistic trauma .
3 points of entry-- left shoulder ,
right abdominal wall ,
and right temporal .
did he suffer ?
not for long . no .
his brain stopped working before he
was able to process his last breath .
after the final shot , he was gone within a fraction of a second .
would you excuse us , please ?
of course .
thank you .
did you hear any of that ?
he didn &apos;t suffer .
listen to me .
listen to me .
sometimes you put up these walls and you block us out ,
and you can &apos;t do that , not right now .
we need you , kid .
gideon needs you .
i &apos;m going to step right out there ,
and when you &apos;re ready ...
let &apos;s go get this son of a bitch .
who would want to kill my dad ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
did he say if anyone had contacted him recently ?
you mean someone from his past or something ?
anything .
after he left the bau ,
he called to tell me about his list .
he never said it was a bucket list ,
but that was the idea anyway .
reconnecting with me was one of his things .
which is ironic , because most of my life
i felt like he was avoiding me .
he was gone so much of the time ,
i figured he regretted even having me .
that &apos;s not true .
i knew your dad pretty well .
and he had trouble with a lot of things .
saying &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; was one of them .
ok , gideon fueled up every 350 miles ,
he probably stopped at some diners along the way ,
&apos;cause , you know , the man could like live off of milkshakes .
definitely he took his sweet time going down the coast ,
but booked it back from jacksonville ,
and instead of coming here home to his cabin ,
he stayed one night in roanoke .
why ? it &apos;s only an hour away .
spence ?
&quot; i just don &apos;t understand any of it anymore .
&quot; i guess i &apos;m just looking for it again ,
&quot; for the belief i had back in college ,
&quot; the belief i had when i first met sarah
and it all seemed so right . &quot;
that &apos;s beautiful .
who &apos;s sarah ?
gideon &apos;s first love .
you &apos;re remembering the letter gideon left you .
i &apos;m thinking maybe he rushed back
and stayed in roanoke because he was finally happy .
what if he found someone like sarah again ?
how &apos;s the kid ?
not great .
but he &apos;ll get his head back in the game .
rossi , this is crazy .
gideon and i used to walk around scenes like this all the time .
he &apos;d always say to me , &quot; morgan , i &apos;m the unsub .
how did i do it ? &quot;
well , first i shoot my target from a distance , wounding him .
then i move in for the kill .
gideon has the strength to shoot a few rounds into the door .
but he misses .
because i &apos;ve weakened his dominant hand .
gideon didn &apos;t have the strength to hold his gun steady .
so , i stand over .
i get off on this .
my face is the last thing he &apos;ll see .
and then i finish him .
all right , most of the gunfire
was from here to the door , right ?
so then why did gideon shoot way over here to this wall ?
it looks like this was done on purpose .
shot &apos;s gotta mean something .
the devil is in the detail .
i need to check something out . let &apos;s take a ride .
um , hi .
do you need some help ?
i &apos;m pretty sure this thing is busted .
i &apos;ve got a quarter .
you want me to try ?
it &apos;ll just eat it .
it already took 3 of my coins .
you have a phone i can borrow ?
forget it .
no . uh , no , maybe i can help .
what &apos;s wrong ?
the van won &apos;t turn over .
and my dog is sick .
trying to call the vet &apos; cause they got a shuttle
that &apos;ll come pick him up .
here you go .
what &apos;s wrong with your dog ?
oh , bum leg . i thought a walk would help ,
but i think all that made his heart hurt .
you can pet him .
he won &apos;t bite .
he looks ok .
that &apos;s good .
maybe he just needs some water ?
good boy .
i just always thought i &apos;d see him again .
i know .
i &apos;d just really like to play one more game of chess with him .
i know i &apos;m not being very rational ,
and i know i haven &apos;t seen him in a really long time ,
but ... i think about him all the time ,
and i knew he was always out there ,
and now it just feels ...
empty .
but time will pass ,
and slowly you &apos;ll forget how much it hurts .
then maybe you &apos;ll find something else
to ... fill that empty space .
i don &apos;t want to find something else .
i &apos;ve never been in this building .
no need to . this was the bomb shelter back in the day .
i &apos;m sure we can find something dehydrated if you get hungry .
damn if it doesn &apos;t smell the same .
we &apos;re back where it all started , my friend .
we were the behavioral science unit back then .
this is awesome .
they called us the b.s. unit .
we were pretty organized .
all right , i think this is it .
salem , virginia , roanoke county , 1978 .
gideon was the lead on this one .
you know , we got enough material here
for one hell of a book .
don &apos;t you think ?
i said i &apos;m gonna write a book someday ,
use all our hard work , take the credit for myself .
make a million bucks .
that &apos;s nice .
what are you looking at , anyway ?
birds .
there &apos;s a third murder without motive in salem .
a serial crime . let &apos;s get used to saying that .
for the past year he is kill 1 woman every 3 months like clockwork .
so he &apos;s seasonal like zodiac ?
yeah , but he &apos;s not taunting us like zodiac .
he &apos;s too obsessed with his own thing .
what &apos;s his type ?
20 @-@ something , brunettes .
he strangles them , then leaves them in an open grave .
but here &apos;s the thing .
he puts dead birds in their hands .
what kind ?
small , brown .
they look like every other bird i &apos;ve ever seen .
but it &apos;s gotta mean something to him .
well , you got me hooked . let &apos;s take a trip to roanoke .
i want to talk to these victims &apos; families .
maybe there &apos;s a connection between them .
did you catch him ?
no . there was never a fourth body .
so he wasn &apos;t obsessed with the seasonal killing .
maybe you forced him into hiding .
he was to fixated to stop cold turkey .
we thought maybe he was locked up or moved away .
and you never saw that signature again ?
no .
but gideon must have seen something
to make him leave florida early
and drive directly to roanoke .
go ahead , dave .
hotch , i think this is it ,
but i need to fill everyone else in .
the last thing gideon did
was to shoot a bird painting .
i think he was trying to tell us that his killer
is the same one from a case we worked on in 1978 .
so it was someone he locked up .
no , those murders went unsolved .
so if this wasn &apos;t about revenge on gideon
if he didn &apos;t lock the guy up , then what was this ?
maybe he went after gideon because he was back on the case again .
the unsub was strangling 20 @-@ something brunettes .
garcia , were there any female bodies found in roanoke county
in the past few days ?
let me check the crystal web ball .
yes . an unidentified woman in her 50s
was found in a shallow grave just outside of salem .
was she strangled ?
that &apos;s the mystery . there was no foul play .
was there a dead bird in her hand ?
what ? eew . none of that fowl play either .
what &apos;s the significance of the bird ?
those little brown birds were the unsub &apos;s obsession .
so how did gideon get back on the case ?
he saw the story in a national paper
and it obviously piqued his interest .
what are the chances that the same woods
and the same ritual make headlines again ?
but the signature was missing .
that &apos;s why he drove to roanoke .
he needed to make sure it wasn &apos;t just a coincidence .
well , clearly it wasn &apos;t .
and this woman would have been in her 20s back then .
age @-@ wise , that &apos;s his type .
gideon must have thought the same thing .
if she was a victim , then she was held captive for 37 years .
who knows what he did to her in all that time ?
what if he stopped killing because he found the victim
he really wanted and held on to her ?
her recent death could have sent the unsub into a tailspin .
he &apos;s probably gonna want to find someone new .
and if it &apos;s anything like what he did before ,
he may hunt and kill until he finds the right one .
we &apos;ll meet you in roanoke , dave .
you need to stay here with garcia .
i know .
ok .
we need to retrace gideon &apos;s steps .
we know he arrived too late to see the body ,
which is probably why he stayed overnight .
maybe he looked at the disposal site first
and went to the m.e. in the morning .
would he have gone to the sheriff ?
probably not , without evidence to back up his theory .
oh . the roanoke sheriff just sent me the report
and a crime scene photo .
gideon didn &apos;t have this photo ,
but he still had a hell of a hunch .
wait a minute .
gideon had a picture .
search through his wallet . there &apos;s a picture of a girl .
sir , he has a lot of pictures in here .
well , look at one of the older ones ,
like it was from a high school yearbook .
tara burnett , roanoke high , class of &apos; 76 .
that &apos;s her .
it &apos;s gotta be . we met her mother back then .
how long has tara been missing ?
3 days .
you told the sheriff ?
he doesn &apos;t believe anyone kidnapped tara .
why is that ?
she isn &apos;t much of a looker .
like they think no one would want her .
but you know this crazy man isn &apos;t taking the pretty ones .
when you told the sheriff your concerns ,
did he report tara missing to other jurisdictions ?
no . he told me to make a flyer .
that &apos;s it ? why ?
because tara ran away when she was in high school ,
a few times . she wasn &apos;t a bad kid .
it &apos;s just ...
her father &apos;s a real ...
and sometimes the cops have come .
so they think she &apos;s run off again .
but ...
look , i might not be the best mother ,
but i love her .
and in my gut ...
i know something &apos;s really wrong .
help me .
ma &apos;am , we have to work beside the local law enforcement .
but they don &apos;t believe me .
you have to convince them to file the proper paperwork .
the fbi has no jurisdiction here . no one is listening to me .
please , please , can you just--can you please ...
this way i &apos;m not the only one thinking about tara .
thank you .
you can &apos;t keep that .
you and your partner .
it &apos;s like seeing ghosts .
he still had tara &apos;s picture , you know .
i know .
he was a good man .
what did you and agent gideon talk about ?
he wanted to know if she had a butterfly tattoo on her ankle .
did she have that tattoo ?
yes .
and now you &apos;re wanting to know , too .
so what &apos;s going on ?
that ink &apos;s pretty faded .
she must have got that 40 years ago .
what was the c.o.d. ?
cancer .
cancer .
she was riddled with it .
no evidence of tissue damage from chemo or radiation .
at first i thought her severe muscle atrophy
and bone loss was a side effect of the disease .
and she clearly lost her appetite ,
because her stomach shrunk to half its size .
you said at first you thought it was about the disease .
what changed your mind ?
well , i hadn &apos;t finished the exam
when i explained all of this to the other one-- what &apos;s his name ?
gideon .
yes , him .
now that i &apos;ve had time to fully examine the body ,
it tells a different story .
she &apos;s got ripped ligaments between
her pelvic girdle and femur bone ,
like her legs had been dislocated multiple times .
she &apos;s got calluses like she was crawling around like a limp dog .
have you ever seen that before ?
yes . on 3 young women many years ago .
he took the time to bring her all the way out here ,
but he didn &apos;t bury her . it speaks to his remorse .
yeah , he probably came here to visit .
want to bet this place has emotional value to him ?
but leaving dead birds in his victims &apos; hands was his signature ,
so why abandon it now ?
maybe he outgrew it ?
keeping her for 40 years became his new obsession .
he &apos;s got to be comfortable here .
it takes some time to gather all this .
clearly not worried about getting busted .
hotch ?
he put her on display .
it &apos;s a nest .
no !
i &apos;m waiting on the dead girls &apos; case files from &apos; 78 .
they haven &apos;t even scanned yet ,
so , it &apos;s gonna take at least an hour .
found it in his freezer .
mint chip .
that was his favorite .
remember that birthday of his and we had the taste test ?
yeah , we couldn &apos;t fool him .
it &apos;s the good stuff or nothing .
we haven &apos;t eaten since--
last night .
is this too weird ?
cha , it is , for lots of reasons .
ok .
that was fast .
it was .
this is not then , though . this is now .
i set an alert for all things roanoke ,
including the boring stuff .
this is not boring , this is bad .
there &apos;s a missing woman . her name is josie behdart .
called on her cell to say she &apos;d be 5 minutes late
for her shift at the library and she never showed up .
there she is .
he likes that age .
hey , hotch , there &apos;s another missing woman .
you need to get to the library on third and main right now .
today &apos;s victim , josie behdart , 23 , single ,
she walked to work .
local cops just found her cell phone in a trash can and ,
surprise , no cameras .
and all the original reports confirm that each of the victims
was taken within a mile of this library .
this guy &apos;s got a precise comfort zone .
it hasn &apos;t changed since &apos; 78 .
my guess is there &apos;s another significance to this location .
a library could be an ideal hunting ground--
a haven for the lonely . let me check it out .
gideon &apos;s plan on coming here was to prove his hunch ,
so he would have gathered enough to make a clean arrest ,
and that &apos;s when he would have called us in .
except he didn &apos;t get the chance .
the unsub identified him first .
where did he spot him ?
the places where the unsub was hunting .
local hangouts . where else would gideon have gone ?
what can i get you ?
did you see a white man in here yesterday , early 60s ?
he was wearing a striped shirt , khakis , sneakers .
oh , sure . yeah .
i usually only get regulars here ,
so it &apos;s easy to remember him .
he messed with his hands a lot .
i took his order ,
and he sat at this booth breakfast to supper .
i gave him an extra piece of pie , he was here so long .
speaking of which , let me get you gentlemen a slice .
uh , just coffee , please .
sure .
he knew this guy was a local
and creature of habit , and this place screams both .
gideon stood out because he &apos;s neither .
that &apos;s how the unsub knew who he was .
and you know he did something to make sure
he got the unsub &apos;s attention .
i &apos;m gonna do that to you .
it takes a long time .
the librarian remembers gideon .
he got a temporary card , checked out these books in the morning
and left them in the drop box on his drive home last night .
he left the library and came here to read books .
it &apos;s classic gideon and classic profiling .
he sat right here to let the unsub know he was watching .
and it worked .
if gideon was so sure he lured the right guy ,
why didn &apos;t he tell us ?
it &apos;s like the unsub was his white whale .
he wanted to catch him on his own ,
and his last move was when the unsub targeted him .
the age of the victims has stayed the same as the unsub has aged .
it speaks to his arrested development .
so the question &apos;s what it &apos;s always been .
why them ? why now ?
and why now ?
why them ? why now ?
it &apos;s called twitching in england .
bird @-@ watching .
i understand the appeal of it .
it &apos;s like hunting .
you hate hunting .
i hate it so much .
but bird @-@ watching . it &apos;s kind of like what we do .
everyone &apos;s got a name and a lineage .
but it &apos;s the behavior that really distinguishes them .
like this one here .
it builds courtship nests in evergreen hemlock trees .
a blue @-@ headed vireo .
is there a quiz later ?
and this one here .
a madly in love , overworked italian ,
who stops at every pay phone to call his wife
and buys an incredible amount of postcards .
it &apos;s a david rossi .
not what you think .
see , you &apos;re collecting the kind of postcards
you would collect if you had a kid .
but you don &apos;t have a kid ,
which means ...
you and carolyn are expecting .
we are .
mazel .
and according to my mother and her old @-@ world
hang the needle and thread over the belly trick ,
it &apos;s a boy .
it &apos;s never been more important to catch a guy like this .
everyone is someone &apos;s baby .
exactly .
so , this book of yours ,
what does it say about the kinds of birds
he &apos;s leaving in the victims &apos; hands ?
nelson &apos;s sparrow .
you see , they &apos;re secretive in nature .
and get this .
they don &apos;t listen to their own instincts
when they &apos;re in danger .
instead of flying off , they scurry away by foot .
these victims , their self @-@ esteem is so low ,
they ignore their own instinct to fight or flight .
so they wouldn &apos;t trust their gut enough
to scream or run away
when danger &apos;s smack in front of them .
the person has to have
enough self @-@ worth to want to cause a scene .
here you go .
and this unknown subject ,
he wants to claim his kill .
yeah .
he makes it unique to him .
the bird in the hand is like ...
a signature .
a signature . yeah .
i like that . we should call it that .
this is it . nelson &apos;s sparrow .
it &apos;s what the unsub left in their hands
because its behavior
matched that of the insecure victims .
so the unsub really knew his birds
and where to find them .
is there some kind of bird lovers club in the area ?
garcia , are there any nature
centers or bird @-@ watching chapters in the area ?
there &apos;s an old @-@ timey bird @-@ watching
group called the flappers ,
median age of like 89 .
they started in the sixties .
most of the members have gone extinct .
and chances are the unsub and his victims
weren &apos;t a part of that group ,
so where else would he meet them ?
tara was his ideal .
what makes her so special ?
tara &apos;s mother said she was broken .
and he knew that because he
spent more time watching her than the others .
so he was able to study her ,
not just glance as she passed by the window .
she was a few years out of high school
when she disappeared .
maybe he knew her from there .
she wasn &apos;t very social .
well , neither was he .
they were both in their 20s when she was taken .
if they weren &apos;t friends in high school ,
maybe they worked together ?
tara &apos;s mom said right out of school
she bagged groceries .
i &apos;ve got tara working at joe &apos;s on main
summer of &apos; 76 through &apos; 77 .
are there any employees at joe &apos;s supermarket
who started in the seventies and are still there ?
well , that &apos;s nearly 40 years ago in a galaxy far , far away
that wasn &apos;t using my magic binary boxes ,
but , yeah , the place is still family owned and operated .
give me a hot minute .
ok . 3 of the people still working there
are women . that leaves two males .
there &apos;s a name i &apos;ve heard before . mallick .
who ?
gertie mallick
was one of the founding members
of the bird group .
died in 1974 .
her next of kin was her nephew
donnie mallick , who inherited her farm
and ...
buys enough birdseed to let me know .
i should send you his address .
do i crack it ?
i want to crack something .
say i get to .
you get to .
you or it ?
it .
you &apos;re so whispery right now .
why so whispery ?
i &apos;m scared .
you &apos;re scared ?
that &apos;s funny .
do i crack you or it ?
it .
it ? really ?
yes !
yes ! yes ! crack it ? you sure ?
yes ? yes ? yes ? crack it ?
ok , you say so .
what did that bird ever do to you ?
what &apos;d he do to you ?
tell me .
nothing .
he didn &apos;t hurt me .
i know he didn &apos;t .
babies having babies .
zettie mallick gave birth to donald allen mallick
in 1956 , 3 months shy of her 14th birthday .
father unknown . when she was 18,
she was sent to live in a mental health facility
for schizophrenia , and 4 @-@ year @-@ old donnie
was sent to live with his only living kin ,
72 @-@ year @-@ old wheelchair bound aunt gertrude .
i have no school records on him past 1971,
and if i do the math from aunt gertie &apos;s death certificate ,
he &apos;s been on his own since he was 17 .
the years of isolation in that house were his stressor .
that explains why he was obsessed with birds .
and when she died , he replaced her with tara .
watch it . watch it .
mallick !
you can lock me up .
i still win .
i got my girls .
and i killed jason gideon .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;d be a big deal in prison for killing a federal agent .
a legend if you killed two .
this is wrong .
this is just plain wrong . pull over , dave .
for god &apos;s sake , pull over !
look , the trail is dead . the bureau isn &apos;t letting us stay .
well , we can &apos;t just leave here .
we did the best we could , jason .
that is not good enough , because he &apos;s still out there .
he &apos;s gonna do terrible things and we won &apos;t find him ,
because there &apos;s so many of them and there &apos;s only 3 of us .
and we can &apos;t do it all . we can &apos;t .
look at this .
we didn &apos;t find her .
this is someone &apos;s baby , do you get that ?
of course i get that .
and you &apos;re right , we need more help .
we need an army .
then let &apos;s get back and build our army .
but we aren &apos;t gonna get it with you screaming to the gods .
ok .
you know , if this writing thing works out ,
you can buy us a plane .
oh , sure . yeah .
i can see it now .
you know , you &apos;ve been pretty edgy .
what &apos;s really going on ?
you tell me , profiler .
i like that .
profiler .
so go ahead , tell me why i &apos;m so edgy lately .
it &apos;s simple , really .
it takes one to know one .
you &apos;re gonna be a father , too .
you &apos;re very good .
not as good as me ,
but impressive , agent .
what &apos;s your middle name .
stephen . why ?
he was brilliant at his job because of you .
he wanted your world to be as great as
he knew you would be .
thank you .
he always said you were his family .
i get it .
if you need anything ,
you know where to find me , stephen .
he loved watching the seasons change from here .
couldn &apos;t wait to get snowed in .
so about 10 years ago ,
we &apos;re sitting on the runway in denver ,
and we &apos;re waiting for the wings to be de @-@ iced ,
and everybody &apos;s stressed out ,
and suddenly gideon collapses
in this fit of uncontrollable laughter .
you know , the crazy kind where he ends up in tears .
i know the one .
and he says that it reminds him
of a case that you two worked in a blizzard
in upstate new york , and there were no cars ,
so you had to take sleds .
lockport . the only time
it isn &apos;t snowing is on the fourth of july .
so he says that there was a dare ...
a double dare , to take a sled
down rattlesnake hill .
there was the local kid . must have been 12 .
he dares us to go down this incline that was legendary .
well , you know gideon .
he &apos;s not about to turn down a challenge .
even from a 12 @-@ year @-@ old .
of course . so he takes this kid &apos;s sled
and goes flying down this hill .
i mean , it was like lightning .
he jumps off right before
it smacks into a headstone .
he said that was you .
no .
yeah , well , he never let
the truth get in the way of a good story .
nope , he sure didn &apos;t .
thanks for reminding me .
&quot; when a good man is hurt ,
all who would be called good must suffer with him . &quot;
