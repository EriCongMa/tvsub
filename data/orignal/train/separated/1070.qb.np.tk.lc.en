the mosconi codex .
this is no ordinary book .
neal .
hello , rebecca .
you two know each other ?
i swear , i had my key card when i left work .
we figure out what &apos;s hidden in those pages
and get to it first .
i &apos;m the reason the thief got in .
my hope was that the owner would let us
study and look at the codex , and now it &apos;s gone .
david siegel . cause of death was a gunshot wound to the sternum .
and we &apos;re no closer to figuring out who did this and why .
dr. summers , i need your help .
just because a person starts doing good things
doesn &apos;t mean he wants to stop doing bad things .
i &apos;ve been serving too many masters .
i &apos;m through being everyone &apos;s puppet .
which strings , exactly , do you plan on cutting ?
all of them .
even the chip in the cover works .
how &apos;d you pull that off ?
i don &apos;t make them . i just sell them .
you son of a bitch .
freeze ! hands in the air .
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
he &apos;s all yours .
what ?
don &apos;t &quot; what &quot; me .
you know what . i gave you specific instructions .
&quot; sit down , make the deal , get arrested . &quot;
three out of three not good enough for you ?
i don &apos;t remember mentioning anything about
follow @-@ up questions or interrogating the suspect before the arrest .
interrogating the sus--
what are you-- what , the chip ?
the chip .
i was gathering information .
for you or for us ?
if i were up to something ,
you really think i &apos;d do it when you had ears on me ?
that &apos;s exactly when you &apos;d do it .
i have a feeling this is about more than passports .
oh , it &apos;s about passports . also about the $ 2 million
that went missing in the last case .
oh , dr. summers might have some insight into its location .
dr. summers had a tendency to take bad guys who wanna be good
and turn them into worse guys .
what exactly happened during your therapy session ?
she encouraged me to be the man i really am .
i think lucy told charlie brown that
and only charged him 5 cents ?
and what kind of man might that be , exactly ?
we were gonna discuss that at our next session .
now i have to wait 20 years .
i think these belong to jones .
hey , where &apos;d you get all these ?
confiscated in various busts around the city .
most in the last few weeks .
it &apos;s first @-@ rate and identical .
these were all made by the same person .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
yeah , the eagle &apos;s eye .
there &apos;s a tiny dot in the center of this one
and in the one i bought from ivan .
that dot is as good as a fingerprint .
so we &apos;re looking at a fairly large forgery operation .
you think ivan &apos;s the artist ?
no , he says he only sells them , and i believe him .
anyone this good would take credit .
think this has something to do
with the uptick of crime in little odessa ?
i don &apos;t believe in coincidences .
ivan &apos;s parking tickets .
ten so far this year , and they &apos;re all
in the exact same spot .
i want traffic surveillance video
for the past six months on that address .
already on it .
really ?
really .
same spot , day after day .
right in front of the hydrant .
there &apos;s plenty of metered parking down the street .
why risk another ticket ?
doris day parking .
i &apos;m sorry . doris day what ?
spot right in front .
the kind of parking doris day miraculously finds
in all her movies .
i never knew you were a fan .
oh , i love &apos; em .
place looks abandoned .
yeah , not a bad spot for a passport forgery operation .
let &apos;s get a warrant and check it out .
the history of cryptography-- oddly cryptic .
any luck finding out what type of code this is ?
oh , i &apos;ve ruled out transposition and caesar shifts .
oh , and sudoku and kenken .
well , in a happy accident , you may have proven
the riemann hypothesis .
the only thing i &apos;ve proven is that we need help .
i &apos;ve studied every pattern , every symbol .
i can only conclude that it is of alien origin .
i think you &apos;re right .
aha ! finally , you &apos;ve come around .
i think you &apos;re right . we need help .
well , i do know a monk in berlin
who dabbles in quantum mechanics .
you think hagen &apos;s using monks ?
i think hagen is using you .
and me .
the only chance we have of getting a leg up on him
is by deciphering the codex first .
until then--
it &apos;s ticking clocks and phone calls .
all right , i gotta go .
peter and i are headed to little odessa .
i do the talking .
we &apos;re just here on a routine visit .
nothing more .
doesn &apos;t look abandoned .
looks like someone brought it back to life .
every time i see ice like this ,
i &apos;m ten again .
oh , she &apos;s good .
yeah .
first doris day , now figure skating .
it &apos;s nice to see your softer side .
who are you ? what do you want ?
we just have a few questions
for the owner of this building .
put that away , or you &apos;ll get all of us killed .
this is private facility .
you &apos;re trespassing .
we just have a few questions .
questions for katya ,
the talk of little odessa .
neal micali , sports agent .
i represent some of the world &apos;s top athletes .
this is peter nevins ,
figure skating coach to the stars .
peter nevins , coach ?
never heard of you .
really ? you ever heard of tara lipinski
or michelle kwan ?
they would be ushers at the ice capades
if it weren &apos;t for this man .
oh , yes . he &apos;s just--
he &apos;s just--
i simply help them harness their own natural talents .
sorry to be wasting your time ,
but katya has no interest in competing .
thank you for your interest .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse us ...
it &apos;s not a problem .
we got another 20 girls to see by the end of the week , so ...
27 .
is it 27 now ?
it &apos;s 27 .
listen ...
you &apos;re talented .
very talented .
don &apos;t give up on your dream .
sorry we wasted your time and ours .
wait . this is not the right time .
but don &apos;t choose another girl yet .
here .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
figure skating coach ?
what ?
you &apos;ve been skating since you were a junior g @-@ man .
but that was hockey .
we &apos;re talking body checks , not twirls .
oh , come on . it &apos;s a good cover .
i don &apos;t need a cover . i could go in there
with a tac team and turn that place upside down .
yeah , you could if you wanted to scare off the guys
we &apos;re really after .
just admit it-- best way into this case
is on skates .
you got a ticket .
come on , this is for your bio , not a mug shot .
come on .
oh , you &apos;re killing me .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
i &apos;ve got asac work .
i can &apos;t play dress @-@ up .
just smile .
rebecca ?
from the gershon museum .
neal , from the fbi .
how are you ?
i &apos;m , uh ...
terrible .
the museum world , it &apos;s really small .
i can &apos;t get another job .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
is there anything i can do to help ?
you ? no .
you &apos;ve done enough .
i &apos;ve been thinking about that day
that i lost my key card ,
and you &apos;re the last person that i remember having it with .
what , you don &apos;t think i stole it , do you ?
why would i steal your key card ?
nothing about that day makes sense .
i had full access to the museum .
i &apos;m just here to get some answers and ...
i was hoping to get a letter from agent burke
stating my complete innocence .
there he is .
uh , yeah , that &apos;s--that &apos;s a really bad idea .
he is swamped on a new case right now
and just not in a giving mood .
anyway , he wasn &apos;t even in charge of the gershon investigation .
then who was ?
that would be agent gruetzner .
art crimes . he &apos;s not at these offices .
so where do i find this agent ...
gruetzner ?
gruetzner .
uh , he is in the field today .
but i could set something up for tomorrow .
all right .
all right ?
tomorrow .
okay .
let me give you my number .
you can text me the address .
we &apos;re the fbi . we have your number .
i &apos;ll get you that letter .
what &apos;s the story ?
sergei turgenev .
our smooth @-@ talking friend from the ice rink .
got that from a friend at fapsi .
that &apos;s russian intelligence .
russian intelligence .
yeah , this is the crime and punishment of rap sheets .
and this guy ... is worse .
that &apos;s sergei &apos;s cousin nikolai .
wanted for murder in russia .
money laundering , drug trafficking ,
arms trafficking , human trafficking .
basically , any kind of trafficking .
yeah .
nobody knew he was in the country until now .
we don &apos;t give visas to criminals ,
so either he snuck in on a tuna boat ...
or he flew here first @-@ class
using one of sergei &apos;s passports .
question is ... if sergei can bring nikolai in here
without us knowing , who else is he planning to import ?
if i had known about this ,
you could be playing hockey with sergei
instead of learning the difference
between a lutz and a salchow .
all right , don &apos;t you worry about me .
you just focus on becoming a top sports agent .
con men taking 10 % ? i think i can handle it .
okay , let me get this straight .
you need to become an expert figure skating coach in a day ?
no , i just need to look the part
and learn enough to pass muster .
so ... what can you tell me ?
me ?
yeah .
you want me to coach you to become a coach ?
yeah . honey , you &apos;ve watched enough figure skating
to do color commentary on the next world championship .
yeah , that &apos;s what we call an armchair expert .
honey , that is a world away from actually doing it .
you remember--first time i was on the ice ,
it was our second date .
how could i forget ?
you were supposed to teach me .
well , how could i ?
you were sprawled out on the ice like bambi ...
and looking just as adorable .
good save .
all right , this is what we &apos;re gonna do .
we &apos;re gonna start with the basics .
then we &apos;re gonna move to tonya harding
and nancy kerrigan , hopefully by midnight .
and then one day ,
i will finally teach you how to skate .
oh , no , you &apos;re gonna teach me how to skate
as soon as this case is over .
how do i look ?
like an f.b.i. accountant .
agent gruetzner &apos;s conservative attire
is just an attempt to disguise
his subversive and bohemian proclivities .
ah , don &apos;t overplay this , moz .
it is not dinner theatre .
you just need to answer a few simple questions .
i &apos;m a master improviser .
i will be the perfect exigent supervisor .
that sounds familiar .
yeah , it &apos;s not the first time
the suit &apos;s gotten under my skin .
i just heard from the exigent supervisor .
looks like sergei wants to meet at a vodka bar tomorrow ,
and that &apos;s a problem .
i need to be in little odessa at the same time
and i promised rebecca a meeting with you .
you say problem , i say opportunity .
you &apos;ll be off leash .
you can slip away , and big brother will be none the wiser .
true . do we have an office yet ?
yeah , and it &apos;s not far .
dr. gravich , my former chiropractor
and hero to ambulance chasers everywhere
takes his entire staff out to lunch
from 1 : 00 until 2 : 00 every day .
a chiropractor &apos;s office ?
with some posters and sundry accoutrements ,
it &apos;ll look the part .
and to keep her from asking too many questions ,
we can show her the codex .
she is a mosconi expert .
that &apos;s why she started working at the museum .
until you got her fired .
maybe she &apos;ll forgive us
if we give her a little peek at our chapter .
so you can reward her for your misdeed
by having her reward us with her information .
hello ?
here comes one of our accoutrements now .
say hello to the art crimes division &apos;s comely receptionist .
f.b.i. may i help you ?
all right .
all right , jones and the tac team
are in a van a few blocks away .
any closer and i think it &apos;d be too risky .
yeah , no riskier than you after half a bottle of vodka .
what ?
which is why i made these .
no , look--
no tricks .
i can handle myself .
what ?
really ?
yes .
when was the last time you did a shot ?
i don &apos;t--it was hughes &apos;s retirement party .
we did three of them .
oh , three ? three .
yes .
well , in russia it &apos;s customary
to drink until the bottle is empty .
this will keep us sober without insulting sergei .
neal , i don &apos;t need your trick glasses .
no problem , but , uh ,
i probably shouldn &apos;t walk in there with this .
thank you .
he isn &apos;t here .
neal caffrey ! you bastard .
i dated his sister . the ballerina .
why does your love life always end up affecting me ?
get him out of here before he blows our cover .
and wait for me right outside .
dimitri ! so good to see you .
you never call my sister .
i should kill you .
all right , okay .
take it easy now , all right ?
you and i both know i was one of many .
what do you mean , &quot; one of many &quot; ?
my sister is a saint .
how was that ?
it was perfect .
it could not have gone better .
was the accent too thick ?
no , it wasn &apos;t . it was great .
you &apos;re gonna nail that fiddler on the roof audition .
thanks .
break legs , kid .
hey , i ditched the anklet and peter .
i &apos;m on my way .
where is your fast @-@ talking friend ?
oh , something urgent came up .
you know agents--always putting out fires .
uh , bring us the caviar , shashlik ,
and a plate of pickled mushrooms .
so , peter nevins .
yeah ?
figure skating coach to the stars .
nikolai .
there is just one little problem .
what &apos;s that ?
you don &apos;t seem to exist .
无搜索结果
now , how can you be famous
if you don &apos;t exist ?
that &apos;s true .
peter &quot; neevens &quot; doesn &apos;t exist .
but ... peter nevins--
n @-@ e @-@ v @-@ i @-@ n @-@ s--
he does .
it &apos;s an understandable mistake .
if i were put in front of a cyrillic alphabet keyboard ,
i &apos;d--well , i wouldn &apos;t--
i wouldn &apos;t be able to get past , na zdorovie .
na zdorovie .
you &apos;d think art crimes
would call for a more aesthetically pleasing setup ,
but we take a backseat to wall street .
good afternoon , agent caffrey .
and this is june .
our office couldn &apos;t function without her .
he &apos;s not exaggerating .
ms. lowe .
agent gruetzner . we &apos;ve been expecting you .
i filled agent gruetzner in on our talk .
i &apos;m sorry for any problems the bureau may have caused .
i have the letter you requested ,
along with my card ,
in case any potential employers
need to call to verify .
thank you . uh ...
but i &apos;m still looking for closure .
i have some questions .
could we , um , speak privately ?
actually , there &apos;s something we &apos;d like to talk to you about .
you &apos;re married , yes ?
yeah . happily .
that &apos;s good .
because katya is a woman many men desire .
she once had a coach who was single .
they would spend hours practicing ,
often late into the night .
very late .
he no longer skates so well .
well , you should see what my wife does to me
when i miss dinner .
that &apos;s good .
yeah .
well , sometimes .
yeah .
but the codex has been hidden away its entire existence .
the owner strictly forbade anyone from opening it .
how--how did you get a copy ?
that &apos;s classified .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re on a need @-@ to @-@ know basis .
as in , we need to know what you know
and not the other way around .
if you &apos;re willing ,
the fbi would like your assistance
deciphering its meaning .
it could help us solve a very serious case .
there is one small matter that you need to be
made aware of .
there &apos;s a dangerous criminal
who wants the information in the codex ,
and we need to figure out why .
and time is of the essence .
you know what ? you drink like russian .
thank you .
well , almost .
you start tomorrow .
tomorrow &apos;s good .
good . good .
now , let me give you some advice .
stay on the ice and out of my business .
understood .
so a dangerous criminal is interested
in the mosconi codex ?
we just wouldn &apos;t want to put you in harm &apos;s way
unless you knew what you were getting into .
the fbi will protect you .
look , i know i might just seem like
another bookworm to you guys ,
but i can hold my own .
i just need time to think about it .
you have my card . call with your decision .
just make it soon .
every minute counts .
i &apos;ll go down with you .
thank you .
we got two minutes !
hmm . neal ?
neal ?
hey . how &apos;d it go ?
i told you to wait right outside .
yeah , i figured you could use some coffee
after all that vodka .
i found a great little place down the street .
amazing tula gingerbread .
are you inebriated ?
no , i &apos;m not inebriated .
here .
get the car . you &apos;re driving .
you know how alcohol tends to amplify
certain personality traits ?
get the car , neal .
i &apos;m on it .
good work on that peter nevins bio .
it &apos;s a good thing they didn &apos;t check five minutes earlier .
we were still uploading .
neal took off , didn &apos;t he ?
yeah , he sure did . i wanted to follow ,
but i didn &apos;t want to leave you in there with sergei .
find out where he went .
will do .
morning .
time for breakfast ?
uh , i &apos;m running late .
i &apos;ve got a stack of asac files
the size of an oddly shaped child .
you know , when we , um , we talked about this job ,
i was actually thinking ,
&quot; wow ... predictable schedule .
reasonable hours . &quot;
and now it &apos;s back to late nights and early mornings
and vodka rooms .
to say nothing about the figure skaters in short skirts .
well , she &apos;s not my type .
i &apos;m more into the bambi kind of thing .
mm , the uncoordinated limbs sprawled .
exactly .
you okay ?
hon ...
every day you &apos;re in the field ...
every day , i ...
i can &apos;t exhale until i hear you
walk through that door at night .
and i don &apos;t like that feeling .
agent siegel &apos;s murder was a random act of violence .
could have happened to anybody .
but it &apos;s not gonna happen to me .
i promise .
we good ?
can &apos;t wait to hear your notes on how to improve that .
i don &apos;t have to give notes .
i only have to pretend to give notes .
mm , kneeling at the anklet of the master
has taught you well .
the master is chewing gum ?
i &apos;m getting into character .
i &apos;m neal micali .
he chews gum when he &apos;s nervous .
i don &apos;t need a backstory .
i &apos;m gonna go try to find sergei &apos;s passport workshop .
hey ... make it quick .
sergei doesn &apos;t like anyone nosing around .
save your coaching for the ice .
you ready , coach ?
yeah .
you can trust us .
but you have to tell me everything
about sergei &apos;s business .
all i know is that he brings terrible people
to little odessa .
he wants to control it .
everyone is scared of him .
then why are you with him ?
in the beginning , he was a good man .
i moved from moscow to be with him .
now he treats me like possession .
last week , he thought i cheated on him .
so he ... hit me .
and the next day , like nothing happened ,
he asks me to marry him .
what did you say ?
if i say yes ...
i &apos;ll be miserable forever .
and if i say no ...
i &apos;m dead .
you &apos;re my coach .
you have advice ?
piotr !
sergei .
i didn &apos;t expect you here so early .
you think i could just let you coach
the love of my life without a little observation ?
i &apos;m curious to know what you think .
so katya &apos;s had trouble executing her salchow .
in my opinion , the problem is her center of gravity
when she lands on the inside edge .
well , that would be a problem .
the salchow always lands on the outside edge .
all she needs is a slight adjustment .
the extension of her free foot on the three spin
tends to be a bit shallow .
okay . work your magic .
now , listen , make sure
that you keep that extension long .
think long .
go skate . trust yourself , all right ?
don &apos;t forget to keep an eye on this guy .
and push .
not bad . not bad .
but not perfect either .
in competition , you gotta be flawless .
we &apos;ll keep working on it .
don &apos;t go easy on her . she needs to learn discipline .
sergei .
i got my hockey skates in the bag .
katya can take a break while i give you a few pointers .
that &apos;s why you americans are losing your edge .
all play and no work .
oh , okay . i get it , i get it .
you don &apos;t want a repeat of miracle on ice .
被称为冰上奇迹
the u.s. kicks russia &apos;s ass again .
that &apos;s an open wound for many of my countrymen , peter .
get my skates . see you on the ice .
excellent .
bingo .
jack , that is the same line that you sold katarina ...
in brussels in &apos; 97 , all right ?
hey , you .
hey , my cell phone died .
all right ? can--do you mind ?
hey , pal , listen , i &apos;m jetlagged , all right ?
so let &apos;s close this out ,
or i &apos;m gonna have to call your competition .
out . now .
do you know what this is ?
it &apos;s a deal memo for katya .
a generous salary , bonuses and bumps ,
travel , food , lodging , wardrobe .
now , get lost .
or you can explain to sergei
why katya will be crying into her sequins all night .
yeah , i &apos;m back . sorry .
hold on , jack .
two minutes . i come back , you be gone .
all right .
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m still here .
just , uh , cleaning my ears out from all the manure .
you &apos;ve been shoveling against them for the last ten minutes .
oh , it &apos;s nice showing you how it &apos;s done .
four out of five , peter .
i wish you good luck .
thank you .
keep your eye on the puck .
that &apos;s one .
not too bad .
but we &apos;re playing best of three .
oh , let &apos;s make it best of five .
vanya .
seryozha .
what the hell was that ?
that one got away .
you know what ? you &apos;re a crazy person .
but i like that .
i &apos;ll finish with you tomorrow .
i have business to take care of .
ivan made bail .
why wasn &apos;t i told about this ?
the court dropped the ball .
someone didn &apos;t get the memo
that we &apos;ve got an open investigation .
by the way , gretzky ,
did you mean for the puck to hit the wall ,
or were you trying to hit sergei and missed ?
you should come to the firing range .
trust me . he never misses .
thank you .
the names on the printout neal grabbed ,
match fugitives on the russian intel watch list .
calls between the ice rink and moscow ,
shot up in the past week .
looks like sergei &apos;s bringing in new recruits .
they &apos;ll be untraceable ,
the minute they get through customs with new identities .
yes ?
so if we don &apos;t crack sergei &apos;s network soon ,
a bunch of hardened russian criminals
will go into the wind on u.s. soil .
seems like enough of them already have .
come on .
ivan was pulled out of the east river this morning by nypd .
they didn &apos;t trust him not to talk .
russian intelligence agreed
to extradite all of sergei &apos;s men who were already in new york .
with the clean passports ,
they &apos;re gonna be almost impossible to find .
we &apos;ve dealt with money laundering before ,
but sergei &apos;s laundering people .
so ...
how do we round up a bunch of fearless russians
who are scattered throughout the city ?
before they tip each other off .
it &apos;s gonna take a lot of manpower
and a lot of preparation .
and we &apos;re running out of time .
what if sergei brings him to us ?
i &apos;m listening .
well , what &apos;s the one thing his guys can &apos;t resist ?
an excuse to party .
so let &apos;s give them something to celebrate .
okay .
maybe provide sergei with the answer he &apos;s been waiting for .
katya ?
what kind of fiance would he be
if he didn &apos;t throw a party to celebrate
the happiest day of his life ?
nice .
he would not be a good one . that &apos;s excellent .
we put them all together in one place at the same time ,
and we put an end to sergei &apos;s grip on little odessa .
i &apos;ll do it .
all right , katya ,
i will make sure that nothing happens to you .
but i need to know from you
if you are really up for this .
i woke up at 5 : 00 every morning as a child .
walked to the gym in the snow six miles away .
at practice , my toes bled in my skates .
but i put on a smile every day .
this is nothing .
sergei !
peter helped me see how stupid i have been .
i can &apos;t believe it has taken me so long .
yes ... i will marry you !
tonight , we celebrate .
he has a lot of friends .
they can &apos;t all be criminals .
we &apos;ll do some weeding at headquarters .
peter ! hey . come here .
i &apos;m so glad you could make it .
i was hoping to meet your lovely wife .
ah , she sends her regrets . she came down with the flu .
ah , too bad . maybe at the wedding .
your cousin isn &apos;t sticking around for the celebration ?
&quot; life is a place of service . &quot;
do you read tolstoy ?
ah , war and peace , one of my favorites .
ah , enough talk . huh ?
let &apos;s celebrate .
nikolai &apos;s leaving . stall him .
i want him to be here for her engagement present .
but i &apos;ll miss your speech .
i &apos;ll make sure somebody records it .
uh , excuse me .
excuse me . i &apos;m sorry . excuse me .
i &apos;m peter nevins .
none of you know me , but i am katya &apos;s coach .
and i just want to congratulate my new friend sergei
and his lovely , talented fiance katya .
hey , buddy !
it &apos;s neal micali .
come on , the party &apos;s just getting started .
where &apos;s the fire , my man ?
hey , i feel like we got off to a bad start .
how about you and me go back up there ,
have a shot or three -- what do you say ?
so what i &apos;m really trying to say is ,
it &apos;s good to put all these names to faces .
so raise a glass .
oh , one other thing .
you &apos;re all under arrest .
fbi ! nobody move ! hands in the air !
get down !
you &apos;re no sport agent .
yeah ,
and you &apos;re not &quot; sammy jordache &quot; ?
really ?
don &apos;t even think about it .
back away .
just put it down right now .
back away .
put that knife down right now !
i &apos;m taking her with me !
you got five guns on you right now !
put it down !
you okay ?
you were right .
peter nevins doesn &apos;t exist .
by the looks of it ... neither do any of these people .
remember my face .
get him out of here .
so ...
off to innsbruck .
yes .
that should be an adventure , huh ?
oh , i hope so .
any last advice , coach ?
watch your leading edge on the double axel
and be sure to not lock your knees
on the biellmann spin .
oh , you have no idea what any of that means , do you ?
no . a commentary once said it on my research dvds .
it sounded good .
thank you .
sure .
good luck .
i &apos;ll walk you out .
thank you .
bye .
what &apos;d you find ?
surveillance cameras a block from the vodka room
led us to a cabbie .
he picked him up and brought him here .
any special about this place ?
nah , it &apos;s just your average office building .
accountants , therapists . nothing out of the ordinary .
is there any reason he &apos;d slip away to come here ?
neal always has a reason .
you can pull the ripcord on your safety chute .
rebecca just called on the burner phone .
really ? what did she say ?
do i detect a lilt in your voice ?
agent gruetzner sees all . you like her .
what is this , sixth grade ?
personally , i don &apos;t see the attraction .
she doesn &apos;t want to rob you or arrest you
or charge you with insurance fraud .
just tell me what she said .
she wants to meet at the rare book room .
you know , there &apos;s nothing more enchanting
than a beautiful woman cradling a classic opus
in her soft , gentle hands .
would you like to take the lead on this one ?
no , you &apos;re the front man .
i &apos;m merely rhythm guitar .
yeah , well , so was john lennon .
thank you for that .
leave your heart off your sleeve .
can i help you ?
yeah . uh , just a routine call .
we &apos;re checking all the offices in the area .
anything unusual occur here in the last couple days ?
not unless you consider a room full of herniated discs unusual .
mind if i poke around ?
honey , you go ahead and poke .
hello , dr. gravich &apos;s office .
how can i help you ?
well , what seems to be the problem ?
um ... how &apos;s thursday ?
he &apos;s here from 10 a.m. till 5 .
okay .
mind if i read over your shoulder ?
uh ... it &apos;s not exactly light reading .
oh , mosconi .
yeah . i figured we could , um , start our research .
does that mean you &apos;ve come to a decision ?
yes , it does .
i will help you with the codex .
um ... but ...
i should tell you something first .
just so you know .
tell me .
i , um ...
i did time .
really ?
i was 19 .
it was a semester in marrakesh .
so i &apos;m in the menara gardens ,
and there was this beautiful green tile .
what , in the saadian pavilion ?
so it had fallen off the roof ,
and i pocketed it .
and i always meant to take it back ,
and then when i tried ,
you got pinched .
it was the scariest night of my life .
um , i &apos;m sorry , &quot; night &quot; ?
singular ?
believe me
one night in jail ?
one night in moroccan prison is enough .
look ... we &apos;ve worked with ex @-@ cons before .
even seasoned , hardened criminals , like yourself .
did you have a prison bitch ?
sorry .
and , in the interest of full disclosure ,
i ... our copy of the codex is incomplete .
how much do you have ?
a single chapter . it &apos;s chapter 13 .
does that mean anything to you ?
you know what ?
what ?
i &apos;m done with games .
games ? what are you talking about ?
i--did i say-- what did i say ?
go ahead . open it . chapter 13 .
no luck ? try this one .
mosconi was incredibly superstitious .
in all the books he ever produced ,
he never wrote a chapter 13 .
that &apos;s it .
you &apos;re getting your sea legs back .
frozen sea legs .
is it really okay that we &apos;re doing this ?
well , technically , it &apos;s a crime scene ,
so don &apos;t touch anything .
okay . all right , tell me how to turn again .
uh @-@ oh . all right , just put pressure on the outside blade .
and lean .
oh ! oh , like that !
there you go .
good .
i got you .
yeah . you always do .
kind of like our second date .
little better .
