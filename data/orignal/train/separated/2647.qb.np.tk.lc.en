harold ?
got it .
i got him .
who is it ?
i &apos;ve got it .
you cannot be here .
karakurt &apos;s in the trunk .
if we get him to talk , we can exonerate liz .
harold , honey , is the coffee ready ?
i &apos;ll bring you a cup .
i &apos;ll take a cup .
get that thing out of here .
in the garage . now .
is he ...
no , just knocked out .
at least i think so .
i hit him pretty hard .
you think so ?
i don &apos;t know .
how you doing ?
if you are just joining us , an update now on our top story .
six employees of lazarum systems international
联调局展开调查
were abducted outside its annapolis headquarte .
although no suspect has been named ,
federal authorities are treating this
联调局展开调查
as an act of terror on american soil .
so , the rumors were true .
you knew this would happen ?
&quot; do i dare to eat a peach ? &quot;
《 j · 阿尔弗瑞德 · 普鲁弗洛克的情歌 》
i may as well live dangerously .
raymond .
what are you doing here ?
drinking your bellinis .
i told you on the phone ,
i can &apos;t help you .
and i told you i &apos;m not willing to take no for an answer .
set the meeting ,
and i &apos;ll consider your debt from caracas as paid in full .
i told you -- normally , i could work something out ,
but with all the heat on you two ,
it &apos;s impossible .
zal bin hasaan .
what if i could deliver him to you ?
a gift for your employer .
the fbi , interpol , mossad ...
they can &apos;t find him , but you can ?
is that a yes or a no ?
bring us zal bin hasaan , and you &apos;ll have your meeting .
hasaan ?
that &apos;s the rumor you heard ?
he &apos;s responsible for the abduction of the lazarum employees ?
all we have to do now is find him .
how do you propose we do that ?
with a little help from our friends .
agent navabi .
may i assume you &apos;re aware of the recent abductions ?
me and every agent in the building .
perhaps .
but they don &apos;t share the same personal investment
that you have in today &apos;s events .
and why is that ?
because you and i both know
that lazarum systems international
is providing technical expertise
to israel &apos;s missile @-@ defense shield .
they &apos;re encrypting software for the iron dome .
whoever took those contractors is an enemy of israel .
that &apos;s a long list . - let me shorten it --
zal bin hasaan .
imagine --
the man who &apos;s killed more mossad agents
than any other assassin in history ,
right here on american soil .
that &apos;s not possible .
that &apos;s what you thought in cairo .
he was right behind you , and you didn &apos;t know it .
that mistake cost your partner his life
and put you in an egyptian i.c.u.
but back then , you were missing one critical element
that would have made all the difference -- me .
what exactly are you suggesting ?
that we combine our efforts .
we both want hasaan .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
how many in your party ? - oh , no , it &apos;s just --
you are beautiful .
actually , i &apos;m looking for somebody
that i believe has been a customer of yours .
they in some kind of trouble ?
oh , no , no , no .
quite the opposite .
an uncle of hers passed
and left her quite a sizeable bequest .
i work for the estate .
you &apos;re looking to give her money ?
the truth is , i &apos;m one of many people tasked with finding her .
and we &apos;ve been chasing every lead for weeks .
and one of them has led me here .
i never met her .
but him , the man ?
he left his number for me to give to her .
any chance that you still have that number ?
yeah . i &apos;ve got it right here .
i &apos;ve never seen this man before .
he &apos;s your agent ,
sent by you to murder reddington and keen .
can you prove that ?
no , because it &apos;s not true .
reddington and keen are building a case against his organization .
my organization is the c.i.a.
we protect this country against people like reddington .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
look , i &apos;m going to bring keen in .
but i need assurances that she &apos;s going to be protected .
your allegations have been heard , agent ressler .
but right now , you two have one job --
find elizabeth keen .
the president believes
the best way to do that is to work together ,
but since clearly you &apos;re incapable of that ,
work your leads separately .
i &apos;m not going to punish you for hating each other ,
but i will take my grandfather &apos;s izmel to your private parts
if i find out you &apos;re misleading each other
or failing to share intel .
got it ?
i could hear you guys yelling from down here .
i made our case .
so , is he in or out ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i think i bought us some time ,
so let &apos;s make the most out of it .
already on it .
well , uh , agent navabi is .
mr. reddington called her ,
claiming to know who &apos;s responsible for the lazarum abductions .
zal bin hasaan is an alias .
his true identity and background are unknown .
he &apos;s supposedly iranian @-@ born , mid @-@ 30s .
this is the only photo of hasaan .
it was taken four years ago by an agent named avi lebov .
three minutes after this image was captured ,
the vehicle hasaan exited detonated ,
killing lebov and 12 civilian bystanders .
mossad once had 24 agents devoted to killing hasaan .
for a period of time , i was one of them .
in 2012 , my partner and i flew to egypt ,
hoping to pick up his trail .
unfortunaty , he had picked up ours .
he followed us to cairo .
i was still lying in a hospital bed
when my partner &apos;s body was flown home to his family .
we know hasaan was involved in dozens of attacks ,
but there are others where his role
has yet to be confirmed .
those include the pishin bombing in iran .
wasn &apos;t that where your brother was killed ?
maybe that &apos;s why reddington brought you the case .
the focus of this task force is to find reddington and keen ,
so i understand if you feel
that this is something we can &apos;t pursue .
forget that . we are doing it for you ,
for your brother .
we &apos;re doing it , right ?
agent mojtabai .
when ?
okay , got it . thanks .
a video was just sent to several news outlets .
it was turned over to the bureau a few minutes ago .
my name is michael hasti ,
and i am a senior software engineer for lazarum systems .
this morning ,
six of us were taken in retaliation
for our company &apos;s criminal collaboration
with the state of israel
on the missile @-@ defense sysm known as the iron dome .
our captors send this message
to all who aid their sworn enemy --
&quot; we will find you
and you will pay for your crimes .
you will hear from us again in two hours . &quot;
reach out to your contacts in mossad .
i want everything they have on zal bin hasaan .
&quot; and you will pay for your crimes .
you will hear from us again in two hours . &quot;
sir ? sir ?
that guy ...
sweater vest .
a year ahead of me at m.i.t.
won the sprowls award for his thesis
on default @-@ deny firewall security .
c.i.a. recruited him as a sophomore .
never gave me the time of day .
ever . like , ever @-@ ever .
was there something you wanted to show me ?
a phone number .
sweater vest is running a tap on it ,
which i know ,
because i got around his firewall
and accessed computer .
which , despite being a felony , feels amazing .
maybe he got liz &apos;s new cell ,
or , you know , maybe mr. reddington &apos;s ?
you up on the line ?
without a warrant , that would also be a felony .
but yes , absolutely .
the muzzle flash .
i missed it before , but watch .
the muzzle flash lit up his glasses .
that is a power plant and if you look closely ...
oh , my god . brilliant .
nice one .
all right .
that &apos;s sellinger power .
they operate at a facility outside of bethesda .
notify s.w.a.t. let &apos;s get out there .
ressler , mossad has a task force
that &apos;s been working with the c.i.a. to find hasaan .
they deserve to be there when we take him down .
i &apos;m calling the police .
i &apos;ll handle this , charlene .
agent ressler is the one --
no , we got to handle this ourselves .
handle what ? are you out of your mind ?
he is in the trunk in our garage !
hey , you got any power tools ?
what the hell is he doing ?
he &apos;s dying , you idiot .
suicide by soap ?
it &apos;s biodegradable -- soy @-@ based .
he &apos;s allergic .
he put himself into anaphylactic shock .
i &apos;ve got his hands .
all right , spit it out .
charlene ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you know i wouldn &apos;t be here if i didn &apos;t have to .
but at the last potluck ,
did i hear you say that wally has a peanut allergy ?
yeah .
i got an epipen !
even if he is alive , he &apos;s not gonna talk .
guy would rather die .
duct tape , please ? duct tape .
we &apos;ve got the perimeter secure .
wide spectrum signal jammers online
in case they got any detonators rigged up inside .
any estimate on the unfriendlies ?
our thermal imaging is inconclusive .
we &apos;ve got a man in position to get a camera in
for a closer look now .
looks like mossad &apos;s joined the party .
shalom .
donald ressler , commander farrow ,
agents shur and singer .
i heard most of what we know about hasaan
thanks to you guys .
well , we &apos;ve been a lot less effective
since agent navabi left us .
you poached a good one .
i know .
eyes are up .
we &apos;ve got hostages on site . i &apos;m seeing five .
four unfriendlies --
two on guard ,
two at the entry point .
hang on .
there &apos;s another one on the catwalk .
he &apos;s giving orders of some kind .
hasaan . - that side door your man &apos;s on --
can you breach it ?
breach it ?
by the time you get inside ,
they &apos;d have moved on the hostages .
you need a static simon .
a breach grenade ?
i mean , that &apos;s a military @-@ grade weapon .
we don &apos;t have time to requisition one .
what if we had one ?
you guys are in the country , gathering intelligence .
why would --
you know what ? don &apos;t tell me .
all right . let &apos;s move in .
it &apos;s hasaan ! he &apos;s on the catwalk !
2 : 00 ! i got him !
looks like he set off a trip wire .
we got nothing . no sign of him .
how is that possible ?
i thought all the exits were secure .
there was a secondary explosion on the south side of the building .
that may have been hasaan .
all right .
i want all these bodies i.d. &apos; d a.s.a.p.
you guys need to see this .
hasaan has been keeping these men captive .
shahin ?
sister ?
agent navabi ?
agent navabi ?
you okay ?
it &apos;s arash ahmadi .
he &apos;s been on our radar for at least three years .
so he &apos;s not hasaan ?
no .
neither are the other three .
how can you be so sure ?
they &apos;re too young .
hasaan is in the wind .
we need to get the hostages somewhere safe ,
start taking their statements .
right now , they &apos;re our best chance of finding hasaan .
well , our facility &apos;s a few miles away --
it &apos;s a logical place .
sounds like a plan .
did you know he was alive ?
hassan ?
my brother .
did you know he was being held prisoner ?
shahin is alive ?
i don &apos;t understand how this is possible .
he died in 2009 at the bombing in pishin .
samar , listen to me .
if i had known hasaan was holding shahin ,
i would have told you .
how is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s still being treated .
and hasaan ?
we lost him during the raid .
if hasaan is in the country ,
he was smuggled in like contraband .
i &apos;ll phone a friend ,
see if i can find the rum runner he hired .
so , the bad news -- you &apos;re still alive .
but the good news is that all you have to do to get out of here
is tell your story to the feds .
that &apos;s it .
exonerate liz .
and then i &apos;ll personally fix you a nice soybean smoothie .
so you can croak yourself vegan style .
what &apos;s that ?
so , here &apos;s the deal .
agent keen and i were , uh , married ,
as , like , a job , you know .
but you ever take one of those jobs
just to pay the rent and you find out that you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re good at it ...
you cannot excel at anything you do not love .
well , yeah , i mean ,
where were you when i was married ?
i didn &apos;t figure that out till it was over .
that is the way these things go .
all right , look . we can tell the russians that you framed them
for killing c.i.a agents , a u.s. senator ,
dump you in front of their consulate .
let the russians do their thing , or ...
... or you could help yourself
and help liz .
乔治城 弗吉尼亚州
my old home .
sammy .
so , your brother &apos;s back from medical .
we put him in box one .
and you thought he died in pishin .
there was supposed to be a sit @-@ down
between opposition leaders and members of the army .
it never happened .
a suicide bomber detonated an explosive .
and 41 people were killed .
a terrorist group assumed responsibility .
one day , he was my brother .
he was young and vibrant .
and the next ...
i thought i &apos;d never see you again .
i was told you died that day in pishin .
i saw the d.n.a. report myself .
if you were alive ...
it was supposed to be a great day .
after all our protests ,
we were finally able to bring the government to the table .
but it was a setup .
someone from the government
planted an i.e.d. near our table .
why would the government plant a bomb ?
why kill ranking members of your own army ?
because they knew it would turn public opinion against us .
we were no longer student activists fighting for justice .
we were terrorists .
you were hurt that day .
that &apos;s why they found your blood at the scene ?
i &apos;m sorry i ran , but i had to .
i wanted to tell you ,
but i knew it would only put you in danger .
i went to england to start a new life .
and i thought the regime stopped looking for me .
until a few months ago ,
i realized i was still being watched .
so i had to start over again ,
and this time in america .
but hasaan &apos;s men must have followed me ,
because six months ago ,
they grabbed me from the apartment i was hiding in .
who are you ?
how did you get back here ?
what do you want ?
oh , my .
three questions in not even as many seconds .
which should we answer first ?
actually , how about this --
i &apos;ll ask a few questions first ,
and then we can get to whatever &apos;s on your mind .
i &apos;m sorry , but my name , it is somewhat common .
perhaps you are confusing me with --
i knew a guy that happened to all time .
best glass @-@ smith in new england .
nobody could free @-@ blow a vase like theodore bundy .
can you imagine ?
ted bundy , an amazing craftsman ,
couldn &apos;t sell a vase .
we know who you are , farzin .
is she right , farzin ?
i could blow off a kneecap . - wait , look --
all i did was make the connection
between hasaan and a friend
in the port in charleston .
his men are dead . he needs a way out .
he must have contacted you again .
no .
okay , okay , yes .
i got a message .
he needed a place to lay low for a few hours .
i have the address .
don &apos;t feel bad , farzin .
you &apos;re a smuggler , not a fighter .
来电
tell me you &apos;re okay .
where have you -- are you okay ?
we need to meet .
what &apos;s going on ?
wing yee &apos;s , one hour . i have good news .
it &apos;s tom . he wants to meet .
that &apos;s not a good idea .
aram .
the burner wasn &apos;t agent keen &apos;s or mr. reddington &apos;s .
it was tom &apos;s .
and he just called agent keen .
what did they say ?
they set a meeting .
one hour at a restaurant called wing yee .
does the director know ?
yes .
and it appears he is sending a team .
alert m.p.d.c. send them the address .
aram &apos;s got a line on keen .
i can &apos;t leave him .
he &apos;s my brother . i need to stay close .
i understand . i &apos;ll call .
who are you ?
my name is zal bin hasaan .
lieutenant in the quds force
of the army of the islamic revolution of iran .
four years ago ,
hasaan bombed a synagogue in buenos aires ,
killed 31 people -- 14 women and children .
hasaan walked away with third @-@ degree burns on his back .
my name is zal bin hasaan .
fine .
i just wanted to talk ,
but listen , it &apos;s your funeral .
just -- just hang on a second , all right ?
we got statements from all the hostages .
let &apos;s move to release them .
hey , sir , good to hear from you .
do you have time to talk ?
because there &apos;s a situation .
we got a lead on keen &apos;s whereabouts --
hers and tom &apos;s .
tom ?
yeah , we ran a tap on his phone .
heard him set up a meeting .
it &apos;s aiding and abetting .
i told him to stay away .
he &apos;s gonna regret he didn &apos;t .
donald , look , there &apos;s something
that i need to talk to you about .
look , sir , we &apos;re gonna clear keen &apos;s name first
and then yours and get things back to normal .
i &apos;ll call you when it &apos;s done .
you were right . he &apos;s not hasaan .
who is he ?
the way he &apos;s singing ,
he could be ethel merman for all i care .
he &apos;s ready for you . i need some air .
i just got off the phone with the state department .
you entered the country illegally ,
so the american government intends to deport you .
the u.s. is not my home .
if the americans want to send me back to england ...
no , the u.k. home office is denying your return .
your status there was also illegal , so ...
they &apos;re filing papers to send you back to iran .
that &apos;s -- samar , they will kill me .
i &apos;ve already put in a request to grant you political asylum .
i won &apos;t lose you again .
some operative i am .
i barely recognize my own wife .
ex @-@ wife .
you look great .
that ?
having to hide , that &apos;s gonna end .
you &apos;re gonna have a normal life , liz --
a family , kids , everything you always wanted .
i don &apos;t see that happening anytime soon .
i found karakurt .
karakurt &apos;s willing to confess ? - to all of it --
killing the c.i.a. agents , the senator , the cabal --
cooper is gonna call ressler ,
and he &apos;s gonna get started on a plea deal .
stack up on me . we go in hard .
on my count .
2 , 1 .
i should get back .
federal agents ! nobody move !
you told me that i should have stayed on the boat
and never come back .
the truth is i never should have left .
you were in trouble , and i walked away .
you had a dream .
i wanted you to follow it .
i still do .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you , liz .
i am following it .
see what they all know .
you .
i read a review that said
the wonton soup was so good , it should be illegal .
i dismissed it as hyperbole .
my mistake .
i &apos;m going to need to see your other hand .
that is a beretta m9,
for which i have a concealed carry permit .
go ahead and get that for me .
number &apos;s illegible .
looks like you &apos;re gonna have to come with me
until we get that sorted out .
i &apos;m not him .
i swear .
then why pretend ?
samar , you need to secure the hostages
and clear the facility .
what are you talking about ?
now .
the man you lost is not hasaan .
the real hasaan is there in the building .
the lazarum abduction was a trojan horse .
you need to get out of there now .
let &apos;s go ! move ! move !
let &apos;s go ! get up ! up !
move ! let &apos;s go ! move !
go !
take the lazarum employees outside !
move ! move ! move ! move !
hasaan , we have less than 10 minutes
before the building is surrounded .
that &apos;s all we need .
where &apos;s my sister ?
elizabeth keen .
elizabeth k ...
is that the one from the news ?
who do you work for ?
who &apos;s paying you to find her ?
i &apos;ve been contracted by the german consulate
on an international matter
that has nothing to do with keen .
i have diplomatic immunity .
you may expel me or let me go ,
but you may not under any circumstance
bore me .
is that true ?
yes .
he &apos;s private security .
so why were you on crandall &apos;s jet ?
he abducted a german biophysicist .
i was tasked with finding him .
you were on that jet to find elizabeth keen ,
just like you were at wing yee this morning .
oh , no . i was at wing yee for their wonton soup .
it is fantastic .
you should try some . it will calm your nerves .
sir , sorry to interrupt .
it &apos;s about agent navabi .
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ?
agent ressler seems to believe that we work together ,
that we are part of some sort of cabal
that has attacked america ,
and apparently he will not rest
until he gets the answer that he is looking for .
but he &apos;s too polite to ask the question
in a manner that will yield the truth .
i thought i &apos;d be of assistance .
if you think that you &apos;re gonna -- - about agent navabi .
it is urgent .
they &apos;re watching .
i &apos;m putting a stop to this .
not yet .
who told you elizabeth keen
was going to be at that restaurant ?
let me guess --
you and i are going to play a game of catch @-@ and @-@ release .
nothing quite so humane .
all this time and money and manpower
spent to find and kill me .
how many agents are assigned to this task force ?
i want their names and assignments .
i want that list .
i can &apos;t help you .
now i think i need to find someone who can .
you . up . up .
up ! up ! up ! up ! up !
yes .
who is your o.i.c. ?
your officer in charge , now !
it &apos;s me .
tell me what &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s my brother . they &apos;re calling him hasaan .
i &apos;m sorry , samar .
i &apos;m getting to the truth a little too late .
the lazarum hostages have all been executed . i don &apos;t understand .
if my brother is hasaan ,
why would he risk an attack like this ?
for the list -- the list of mossad agents and their informants
working around the world to find and execute hasaan .
that list is i.s.o.o. secure .
it &apos;s not available electronically .
there &apos;s only a hard copy .
where ?
the covert source record room .
if that &apos;s where the list is ,
that &apos;s where hasaan is going .
in a few minutes ,
half the federal agents in washington
will have that building surrounded .
your only job for now is to stay alive .
i have to stop him .
keep your hands behind your head .
we got the location from your men in jordan .
all we need is the code .
i &apos;ll never give it to you .
my people are prepared to die first .
so be it .
down .
we &apos;ll get into
your precious safe with or without you .
they &apos;ll be coming . we have to go .
what are you doing ?
they got into the building .
they &apos;ll find a way into the safe .
we have to destroy the list before they do .
i thought you quit .
yeah , i did ,
but then you left me , so ...
she &apos;s burned the documents .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
samar , what did you do ?
hasaan , we have to go .
they have agents preparing to enter .
there you go !
all our plans , and we &apos;re left with nothing !
kill her and be done with it .
no .
she &apos;s mossad .
the information we need is in her head .
he will be dead within the hour .
clear !
agents , move !
we take her with us .
we &apos;re looking for agent samar navabi ,
taken 22 minutes ago by zal bin hasaan .
we have his photo and a list of known associates .
stop every train , search every car .
this woman &apos;s one of ours .
bring her home .
there is nothing noble about what you &apos;re doing , shahin .
our parents would be ashamed .
our parents had no shame .
they were cowards .
how can you say that ?
they died for speaking the truth .
you &apos;ve been fooled .
you turned your back on iran , joined mossad --
shahin , they killed our parents .
our parents brought death upon themselves ,
and we suffered for it .
they betrayed us , betrayed our country .
the pishin bombing .
it was you .
that was the day i became the righteous warrior zal .
according to legend ,
a great and wise bird raised the young warrior zal
in her nest atop the highest peak of damavand .
when he came of age ,
she gave him a plume of her radiant feathers
to burn if he was ever in desperate need ,
and she would come to his aid .
pity .
you seem to be fresh out of feathers .
what do you want ?
well , another spin of the bottle in melanie reichman &apos;s basement ,
but i &apos;ll settle for you .
what now ?
that &apos;s your decision .
you can turn him in .
you know what will happen --
rendition , hunger strikes , eventually death
in whatever hellhole he &apos;s thrown into .
or you can give him to me .
the best i can offer is death with a purpose .
which is ?
agent keen &apos;s freedom .
sister ...
you swore to protect me .
i swore to protect my brother .
he died in pishin .
hasaan is all yours .
agent navabi ...
what ?
what is it ?
she &apos;s -- she &apos;s okay .
that was her .
she &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re condoning what he did ,
forcing this guy solomon to swallow a shank hook ?
all that shows is his callous disregard for the law .
our national security is at risk .
while i don &apos;t approve of your methods , peter ,
i am satisfied that there &apos;s no connection
between you and this matias solomon .
what i &apos;m not satisfied by is the explanation for the raid
that captured him .
he tapped tom keen &apos;s phone .
he heard tom keen set up a meeting
with elizabeth keen at wing yee .
and did he , um , share this intel with you ?
no , he did not .
and when we found out , we ran a tap of our own .
see what i &apos;m dealing with here ?
this insubordination .
the only insubordination i see is yours , peter .
i really thought i was clear .
hating each other is fine .
not sharing intel is not .
you and your team will vacate this facility
by the end of the day .
that &apos;s a terrible mistake .
you have till 5 : 00 p.m.
hey . sorry about earlier .
i had keen .
i mean , she was supposed to be there ,
and then this thing with samar ...
what &apos;s he doing here ?
trying to help liz .
you son of a -- i &apos;m -- we talked about this !
we agreed not to work with him !
i told you about their meeting ,
about that call between him and keen --
you tipped them off ! - if you will calm down for a second --
what the hell is he doing here ?
trying to help liz .
i told you he wouldn &apos;t be on board .
you are a lying scumbag , and i don &apos;t trust you .
if you do , you &apos;re a fool .
so , that &apos;s it , huh ?
just gonna walk away .
hey , i &apos;m talking to you .
that &apos;s enough !
enough !
leave it !
i have to live here .
you will have your meeting .
i &apos;ll be in touch when i &apos;m ready .
harold , agent keen tells me
you have the man they call karakurt .
yes .
and i intend on turning him over to the bureau as soon as possible .
don &apos;t .
i have a better idea .
about karakurt ,
i &apos;m told he &apos;s with harold cooper .
yeah , for now .
i &apos;ve arranged for an extraction team .
good .
about earlier ...
i appreciate your understanding .
oh , no , peter .
i &apos;ve been on the receiving end of far worse .
as were you .
i know you don &apos;t approve of what i did --
giving him to reddington .
reddington saved your life .
if giving him hasaan was the price for that ,
i &apos;d pay it twice over .
it took me years to mourn his loss .
now i have to do it all over again .
i spoke to the e.r.
sounds like levi &apos;s gonna make it .
seems like a good guy .
he is .
i mean , this place , this job , it &apos;s ...
after audrey died , i came to work the very next day .
it &apos;s so easy to lose perspective ,
forget what really matters .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m not so sure .
what really matters is this ...
here ... now --
nothing else is guaranteed .
