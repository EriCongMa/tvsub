for over a century , i have lived in secret until now .
i know the risk , but i have to know her .
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
you said you don &apos;t kill to survive .
animal blood keeps me alive
but not as strong as damon .
hello , brother .
damon .
stefan finally fessed up .
stay away from me .
that necklace contains an herb called vervain .
it protects you from being compelled .
i will keep your secret , but ...
i can &apos;t be with you , stefan .
what is that ?
a very important crystal .
are you psychic or clairvoyant ?
technically gram says i &apos;m a witch .
there was a time when this town was
very much aware of vampires
five bodies all drained off blood .
they &apos;ve come back .
you just don &apos;t wanna die , do you ?
she &apos;s transitioning .
into what ?
a vampire .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with her .
she &apos;ll be fine .
no
we &apos;ll all be fine .
vicky
i will make sure that she does not hurt anybody ,
elena . i promise you .
all right , later , man .
see you , bro .
hi , ty
vicky ?
everyone is looking for you .
i know .
what &apos;s wrong , vick ?
i &apos;m so cold .
you are on drugs . everyone thinks you are off on a bender .
i wish
what happened in the woods ? vicki ?
those kids that were killed .
what did you see ?
i &apos;m so scared .
come here .
it &apos;s ok . i will take you home .
i can &apos;t control it .
control what ?
i am so ... hungry , ty .
and it won &apos;t go away
what did you on ?
what drugs did you take ?
i want you . i &apos;m so hungrey , ty .
ok , look , i &apos;ll get you something to eat .
just sit back . let &apos;s just get you home .
vicky , what is wrong with you ? vick !
let go of me .
what &apos;s going on here , stefan ?
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
you don &apos;t talk .
screw you , dude .
dude , really ? dude ...
damon , don &apos;t .
oh , come on . no one is gonna miss this idiot .
don &apos;t you hurt him .
forget what you saw here tonight .
none of us were here .
sorry .
oh , no , it &apos;s cool . i &apos;m done
you are up early . where are you going ?
police station . they are organizing
a search party for vicky , so ...
wait . shouldn &apos;t you be going to school ?
you are kidding me , right ?
you shouldn &apos;t skip school .
if they find her , we will know .
that &apos;s what cellphones are for .
your lips keep moving . i don &apos;t know why .
yeah ?
matty ?
vicky , where are you ? are you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m ok .
tell me where you are . i &apos;ll come and get you .
no , matty . i just need some time
to figure things out .
just know that i &apos;m ok . please don &apos;t worry about me .
i don &apos;t understand why i &apos;m still cooped up here
why can i just go home ?
because you are changing , vicky .
and it is not something you want to do alone .
there is nothing about
that logan guy i killed in here .
not a word .
someone has covered it up .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a very special , very old compass .
what was logan fell doing with it .
aren &apos;t you curious ?
well , if you are so worried that somebody is onto you
why don &apos;t you just leave town , damon ?
we should all be worried .
hey , i &apos;m hungrey .
do you have anything to eat ?
here .
what is it ?
it &apos;s what you are craving .
don &apos;t lie to the girl .
so not what you are craving ,
but it will do in a pinch . right , stef
what is it ?
yeah , what is it ?
it &apos;s skunk , saint bernard , banbi ?
go on , give it a try .
she is new . she needs people blood .
she can &apos;t sustain on that stuff .
yeah , why can &apos;t i have people blood ?
yeah .
because it &apos;s wrong
to pray on innocent people , vicky .
you don &apos;t have to kill to feed .
just find someone really tasty ,
and then erase their memory afterwards .
so easy .
no , no , no .
there &apos;s no guarantee that you can control yourself , ok ?
it takes years to learn that .
you could easily kill somebody ,
and then you have to carry that with you
for the rest of your life .
which , if i haven &apos;t made clear , is eternity .
don &apos;t listen to him
he walks on a moral plane way out of our eye line
i say , snatch , eat , erase
hey , look at me . we choose our own path
our values and our actions . they define where we are .
ok , count deepak
i am out of here .
can i have some more ?
is stephen here ?
yep .
where is he ?
and good morning to you , liittle miss , i &apos;m on a mission .
how can you be so arrogant and glib
after everything you &apos;ve done ?
and how can you be so brave and stupid
to call a vampire arrogant and gilb ?
if you wanna me be dead and i &apos;ll be dead .
yes , you were .
and i &apos;m not .
yet .
where is stephen ?
he &apos;s upstairs .
singing &quot; the rain in spain , &quot; knock yourself out .
stephen ?
stephen ?
yes .
where is vicki ?
she &apos;s upstairs .
what happens now ?
because my brother is out there searching for her
with the rest the town .
and i &apos;ll tell him .
i &apos;m working with her .
but , it &apos;s gonna take time
she &apos;s very volatile and impusive personality
she is a drug user .
i mean all that &apos;s gonna play a part in how she reponds to this .
so she is a vampire with issues ?
what am i supposed to do ?
because i &apos;m lying to everyone i care about .
what &apos;s gonna happen to her ?
i &apos;ll keep her here with me
until i know that she is safe .
how long is that ?
we can talk about it that later .
hey , vicki
how are you ?
how am i ? you &apos;re kidding , right ?
was our family burned in witch trials ?
no . the girls that were persecuted in salem
entirely innocent .
you have to have more than ignorance to trap a real witch .
how did we end up in mystic falls ?
our family fled salem in 1692,
and relocated here .
our ancesters lived in secrecy for over a hundred years .
it &apos;s important that we still do .
grams . everybody knows you &apos;re a witch .
they also know it &apos;s absurd , can &apos;t be true .
i &apos;m just a cooky lady that teaches occult at the university .
no one really believes .
they just poke fun . and let &apos;em .
just don &apos;t let them know the truth .
where &apos;s our witchcraft ?
you &apos;ve been talking history for two days .
and i wanna go to the fun part .
it &apos;s not meant to be fun .
it &apos;s real , and it &apos;s serious .
and you must understand before you practice .
aren &apos;t you late for school ?
you never should have trusted that logan
weasel with that watch .
how many are we dealing with ?
well , that coroner thinks one .
something about the wound radius and the jaw pattern
are we in danger ?
i mean if it found the watch and knows we know
and could it come after us ?
and should i even be saying &quot; it &quot;
or he , or she
if they have any historical knowledge of the town
and they &apos;ll know where the watch come from .
so yes , we can very much be in danger .
so what do we do ?
just keep quiet , we can &apos;t have the entire town aware of this ,
we need to find him before he finds us .
i heard they were putting together a search party for vicki .
she just called , she &apos;s ok .
oh , good . it &apos;s great .
i figured you must &apos;ve been going out of your mind .
a little bit , yeah .
i was just gonna offer
is there anything i can do ?
i appreciate it .
i have got your costume . it &apos;s all here .
seriously ?
come on
can someone please be excited about the halloween
i just wanna have fun , you know .
just some silly , fluffy , damon @-@ free fun .
isn &apos;t this the one you got from damon ?
yep . wear or toss it . i don &apos;t care
i just want it gone .
have you seen elena ?
do you know what she is wearing ?
i was with grams all weekend . i haven &apos;t talked to her .
maybe , she &apos;s with stephen .
riding to his castle on his white horse
don &apos;t be bitter . it provokes wrinkles .
coffee is our friend .
it &apos;s the caffeine . it circulates through our veins
and warms our bodies .
so we are not so cold to the touch .
what if i wanna drink human blood ?
you gotta have to learn to live with that urge .
and fight it one a daily basis , one day a time .
oh , god . don &apos;t start with the whole little twelve steps thing .
school counselor has been down that road and it doesn &apos;t work for me .
it can work . it &apos;s your choice , viki .
so you &apos;ve never tasted human blood .
not in a long time .
how long ?
years and years .
i &apos;m not proud of my brother &apos;s behaviour
oh , does this sketchy feeling ever go away
it &apos;s like i have a massive hangover
this daylight thing is a bitch
i need more blood .
where &apos;s your bathroom ? i have to pee .
why do i have to pee ? i thought i was dead .
i &apos;m going to , un-- i &apos;m gonna get her some more .
right .
i will be quick .
my body is feeling really funky
it &apos;s a good funk , but it &apos;s wierd
who are you calling ?
jeremy
viki , you can &apos;t see jeremy any more
oh , come on . don &apos;t you start .
i &apos;m gonna see whoever i want to see
eventhough you could hurt him ?
i would never hurt jeremy
i know you think that
but i can &apos;t take that risk
you gonna have to let jeremy go now
oh really
and how long have you been preparing
a &quot; you &apos;re not good enough &quot; speech ?
i &apos;m presuming it predates the whole vampire thing .
all i &apos;m saying is
jeremy is not geting involved in any of this .
i mean it , viki .
or what ?
let &apos;s get one thing straight , you perky little bitch
you had my brother whipped for 15 years .
15 years , and then you dumpted him .
when i look at you
that is all i see
just so you know .
and i &apos;m gonna see jeremy whenever i wanna see jeremy
because i have some fun new toys to play with ,
and i won &apos;t think twice of ripping your little head off .
you got it
she threatened me
she &apos;s on edge
imagining every sense in your body
operating at super speed
i mean , she &apos;s uncomfortable in her own skin ,
and then when you throw on her other issues
how long before it settles ? hours , days , weeks ?
there &apos;s no rule book .
well how long before you learn to control her
a while
but i didn &apos;t have anybody helping me .
i have to do it on my own .
the thing is
it &apos;s hard to resist certain people ,
espercially when you are new .
it &apos;s difficult to separate your feelings .
love , lost , anger , desire--
it can all blur into one urge ,
hunger
what does that mean ?
it means that jeremy can &apos;t see her . not now
she might not be able to resist him ,
and she could hurt him .
or worse
i &apos;m not gonna let anybody get hurt .
i need to get going
elena
please stephan . this is only so much i can take .
what are you doing
just contemplating the next hundred of years
why did you do it
i was ...
bored
you did this to me out of boredom
it &apos;s one of the pitfalls of eternity .
now i &apos;m bored
and all i can think about is blood .
i just want some blood .
i can &apos;t think about anything else . what is that about ?
that &apos;ll ease up .
you &apos;ve just been cooped up all day .
let &apos;s go
where ?
your life was pathetic .
your afterlife doesn &apos;t have to be .
what are you doing
she &apos;s been cooped up in your room all day .
she is not anne frank .
no no no no . hey hey
now is not the time for this .
if you are gonna teach her , teach her .
show her what it &apos;s all about .
she could hurt someone
i &apos;m not taking her to disneyland .
we &apos;re going in the front yard .
come on
bad idea , damon
she is a vimpire , stephan .
she should know the perks .
like what ?
like ...
whoa . how did you do that ?
come on , viki

uh , my bad .

and you want me to let it go ?
my head hurts .

yeah .

dot &apos;s let him in , i don &apos;t want him in here .

no , i just don &apos;t want him in here .
just let me come in , so i can explain myself .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , but i think you &apos;d leave now .
matt , please .

i don &apos;t get what &apos;s going on with you . just call me , please .
so , do you wanna hang out tonight ?
we can go to the halloween thing at school .
it could be fun .
good , sure , sounds ... sounds fun ,
can &apos;t wait .
i know you are upset about vicki .
i heard you called mad .
but you can &apos;t be with her .
she needs you to get better .
the best thing you can do for her is let her go .
what does that even mean let her go .
oh , ok , sure , she was such an expert on letting people go , right ?
i know you may not see it yet .
but trust me , jer , it &apos;s for the best .
for months from mum and dad dead , i feel like a crap .
well , nothing really even matter a crap .
now all of a sudden , i got these moments ,
and things started to feel just a little bit better ,
and vicki was in every single one of them .
so you may not see it .
but trust me . keeping me away from her is not for the best .
seidel ? for the ladies ? is a lot with special .
no way ,
last year i was hang over untill thanksgiving .
wait , i am going to drink
untill someone is hot enough to make out with me .
sounds like a plan .

let &apos;s go .
so go ahead .
i &apos;d like to finish my drink .

it &apos;s damon , right ?
oh , you remember me .
you have a face that &apos;s hard to forget .
what &apos;s your last name , damon ?
salvatore
are you in any relation with zach ?
zach is my uncle .
how do you know zach ?
are you ok ?
yes , because something is in my eye .
well , i know zach from the founders &apos; council .
you know , the salvatores were born in this town &apos;s original saddles .
yes , they were .
i wasn &apos;t aware that zach was remembered .
i just recently come back home
and really haven &apos;t had chance to meet any of these friends .
would you tell him to return my calls .
i &apos;ve left several messages .
zach were out of the town . it &apos;s forbiden .

i &apos;m going . i got to find him .
what ? you &apos;re following me now ?
you don &apos;t really give me much of the choic .
let me out of here .
you shouldn &apos;t have been here .
crowds like this will make it even harder for you
to make yourself under control .
i &apos;m fine .
really ?
no headache ? your stomach has not agonized you ?
not feeling light headed ? or anxiouse or cranky ?
like if someboy look at you in a wrong way ,
you can just rape their head off .
do you know what &apos;s that called ?
it &apos;s called hunger .
and it only will get worse and worse every minute .
that you pretend like it &apos;s not controling you .
so you need vervain ?
yes .
my husband and i only have flowers
which his parents left him .
and zach had promised
he could supply us with more .
well , i talked to him all the time .
so why don &apos;t they just ask him ?
how much you need , i mean how many people do you think ?
well , these are children , of course
of course
and friends , family
and everyone on the council .
the council ?
zach knows how many .
you know , i am so late
my husband is not going to be happy with me .
well , are you happy with your husband ?
you &apos;re flirting with me .
you flirt with me first .
true .
let me escort you to the school .
it &apos;s not safe out there alone .
i mean i &apos;ve seen ten vampires tonight .
only the real ones were easy to find .
how is that search going ?
we had the founders &apos; party .
and anyone arrived during the day
was eliminated as supect .
and otherwise we were just dead and so .

shh , shh , shh . it &apos;s okay ... it &apos;s okay .
why does everybody have to die on me ?
oh , my god . come here .

he &apos;s a mess .
i don &apos;t want him going through this again .
he is just a kid .
elena , what can i do ?
what can i do to help ? i &apos;ll do anything ..
can you make him forget ?
i can &apos;t do that .
stefan , please !
i don &apos;t know how he &apos;ll ever get past this ?
i just want him to forget everything that happened .
if i did . there &apos;s no guarantee that it would work .
because of who i am . because of how i live .
i don &apos;t have the ability do it right .
i can do it .
if this is what you want .
i &apos;ll do it .
it &apos;s what i want .
what you want me now ?
i want you to tell him ...
that vicki left town .
and she &apos;s not coming back .
that he shouldn &apos;t look for her or worry about her .
he &apos;s gotta miss her ,
but he &apos;s know that &apos;s for the best .
part of me wishes that i could forget , too ...
forget meeting you .
finding out what you are
and everthing that &apos;s happened since .
if that &apos;s what you want .
yes , it is .
because i don &apos;t want it to be like this .
i don &apos;t wanna feel like this .
but i can &apos;t .
with everything that &apos;s happend ...
i can &apos;t lose the way i feel about you .
