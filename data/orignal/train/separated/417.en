You better run! Meredith!
You can run faster than that girl!
Meredith?
Where'd you go baby?
Meredith?
Come out come out wherever you are.
Meredith?
Fan out.
Meredith...
Meredith?
Found her!
No! Please...
Please...
It's all right.
Let me know when you're finished.
No!
No!
Welcome to the 21st century.
Yay technology.
Behold. Everyone has a new tablet.
We've gone paperless?
Fear not doctor of the dark ages.
I went old school for your anti-technology quirk.
Paper files hard copy photos.
But the abacus is your responsibility.
Garcia not that I don't appreciate your efforts
But exactly where did the funding for these come from?
I did a thing.
A thing?
Best not talk about the thing.
We'll talk about the thing later.
Ok. Instead let's talk about harvest season.
Because it is harvest season in Indiana
And farmers are finding more than corn in their fields.
Meredith Joy Kimberly Jukes and Amanda Frye
were all discovered murdered in Johnson County Indiana.
All 3 women were exotic dancers
Living in different counties in the state.
Kimberly Jukes the first victim
Went missing 6 weeks ago.
And in each instance the women finished their shifts
But they never made it to their cars.
It says here Amanda Frye was found 90 miles from her house.
This guy's going a long way to abduct his victims.
If he's dumping the bodies in the same county
It's a good chance he's located nearby.
It shouldn't be too hard to work up a geographical profile.
Meredith Joy put up quite a fight.
She's got defensive wounds all over her body.
And the lab discovered two
different samples of DNA under her fingernails
So we're dealing with at least a team.
One that rapes beats
and strangles their victims in a cornfield.
They're using condoms. I bet one of these guys has a record
And he doesn't want us connecting the DNA.
And they're accelerating their attack schedule.
It's 3 weeks between the first and second kill
2 weeks between the second and third.
Meredith Joy died on October 31st.
Now they're down to one week.
Who's missing?
Her name is Stephanie Wilson.
She was abducted last night from Club Prowl in Tippecanoe county.
She finished her shift at midnight
But she never made it home to her 2-year-old daughter.
Babysitter called the police
And Stephanie's car was left in the parking lot like the others.
And there's a clear pattern.
All the women have been abducted on Friday night
And murdered sometime sunday evening.
Which means we've got less than 2 days to save Stephanie Wilson.
Stephanie.
Hey wake up sweetheart.
Hey come on sleepyhead.
You gotta get back to work now.
That's a girl.
Come on now.
Rise and shine.
Hey no sleeping in. It's time to get back to work.
Hey don't you struggle.
Hey don't struggle.
Don't struggle.
You know better than that don't you?
Yeah you do. Yeah.
All right.
Batter up.
Whoo! Yes sir.
Oh! God what the hell man!
Wake up. You don't want to miss the show.
Here. Take this.
No no.
"The herd seek out the great
Not for their sake but for their influence
And the great welcome them out of vanity or need."
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Hey guys.
Look at the patterns on the cornfields.
It's all hard turns and zigzags.
They had to have been chasing these women.
Do you think they escaped?
Maybe if it was just the one time but all 3?
They let them go so they could chase them again.
The women probably thought they were being released.
I'd say we're most likely looking for
two dominant alpha male personalities
but we shouldn't rule out one dominant who allows his submissive
To have sex with these victims in order to control him.
Well it certainly speaks to their arrogance
If they're that confident the women won't get away.
Prostitutes and strippers usually make easy targets.
Maybe they need to up the challenge.
The hunt could be what gets them off.
Garcia focus on prior sexual crimes in the area.
This kind of confidence doesn't get built overnight.
Yeah I am compiling as we are face-timing.
I'm also running DNA results through unsolved crimes
In Indiana and the surrounding states.
Good. Let me know as soon as you find anything.
You know interestingly all 3 victims
Had downers and uppers in their system.
Well were the drugs used to subdue the women
Or is it a ruse to get them to come home with them?
Prentiss and Reid go to the club
where Stephanie Wilson worked to find out.
Dave you and Morgan work the dumpsite
And I'll work victimology at the local sheriff's station.
You think you can give me the runaround kemp?
I don't think so.
No one talks to the press but me.
This is my department my investigation.
Do you understand?
You make me look bad.
It's not enough I got the FBI coming in.
No now I have to deal with fumbled plays from my own team?
Desk duty 2 weeks.
Dismissed.
Sheriff.
Sheriff Jeff Salters.
Aaron Hotchner.
Sorry about that.
One of my guys leaked the news
about the dead woman to the press.
I needed to uh send a message.
Why is the investigation being kept a secret?
Well that was my call.
I don't want these guys skipping town
before I have a chance to arrest them.
This ends in my jurisdiction.
Has Stephanie Wilson's father arrived?
He's waiting in the conference room.
He's pretty messed up about the whole thing.
That's understandable.
I just don't get it.
You know how many strippers and prostitutes
I saw get beaten up and raped when I worked the city?
Sometimes it's like they're asking for it.
Nobody asks for this sheriff.
Not consciously anyway.
Shall we go in?
I think I'll speak to him alone.
Look...
I call it like I see it.
These women are victims of heinous crimes.
I won't have you judging them in front of their families.
And I won't have you telling me how to run my show.
The governor may have requested your help
But this is my case.
It's not a show.
It is your case.
And you can watch from the outside.
That had to hurt.
Let's just hope he can take care of business again tomorrow.
Are you suddenly a doubter?
'cause there's the door man.
Are you seeing this?
...live at schmidt farm
Where the body of Meredith Joy was discovered late last week
Making her the third victim in recent weeks
to turn up dead in a cornfield.
The Johnson County Sheriff's Department remains quiet
about their investigation thus far
But we'll stay on the scene as this story...
What are you doing here? I thought we agreed
not to come to each other's work.
What did you get me into?
Me? I didn't know anything about this.
Those girls are dead Chris.
Chase them around have some fun with them
They won't remember a thing. That's what you told me.
Scott that's how it was.
You really didn't know?
Where's Michael?
I'll meet you out back in 10 minutes.
She said she was making extra money waiting tables at a bar.
She's my little girl. I didn't question it.
God this is all my fault.
No one could have foreseen Stephanie's abduction.
It's not your fault.
I know I know. I just I--I can't--
Amy needs her mother.
What are you doing to try to find her?
We're helping local law enforcement by building a profile.
Profile? Why aren't you just out there looking for her?
Who knows what these-- these men are doing to her.
I need you to find my daughter.
We are looking for her.
Hopefully this will point us in the right direction.
No no that's not good enough.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just um
This has all just been too much.
It's all right.
Mr. Wilson I assure you we will not stop
until we find Stephanie.
What would it take for you or one of your co-workers
to go home with a customer?
Nothing. I have a boyfriend.
Does he know that you work here?
It's how we met.
He doesn't have a problem with it. Do you?
No not at all. I'm from Las Vegas.
I don't have a problem with it.
I just um these are questions that we have to ask.
We are not judging you.
We're just trying to find Stephanie.
Now you said you met your boyfriend here.
So you did go home with a customer once before.
Those were the early days.
Everyone's a little wild in the beginning.
Not the veterans?
We know to play it safe.
Was Stephanie the type of girl who played it safe?
She never really went through a wild phase.
All she cared about was getting home to her daughter.
Did anyone try and take her home last night?
Everyone tries.
Every night.
Nothing stood out?
I know she got asked to go to a party.
We all did. But she turned them down.
Them plural?
There were these two guys.
They got dances from each of us.
What kind of party were they offering?
I never got a chance to find out.
It's bad business to discuss private deals on the floor.
Can you show me where you and Stephanie gave them their dances?
Yeah. Over here.
I was in here
while Stephanie was in that one.
Ok.
Could you sit down?
Yeah.
All right I can see the whole room
but I can't see my partner.
If you're working as a team
You both want to see the girl you're gonna take home.
Why would they do it somewhere where they can't see each other?
We should take a look at the club surveillance footage.
Only 2 cameras. There's a lot of blind spots.
How do you keep an eye on all the girls?
We got the one guy in the back
one guy on the floor at all times.
It looks pretty full.
Are you always this busy on the weekends?
Only on theme nights.
The unsubs probably picked
crowded nights to make sure they blend in.
Well they're smart.
They make a plan of attack before they get to the club
Then they separate and choose their prey.
I doubt they were very happy when Stephanie turned them down.
Alpha personalities don't handle rejection well.
They abducted her from the parking lot
just like the others.
It didn't matter what she said.
Stephanie was going to that party whether she wanted to or not.
How the hell did they find this place?
We must have taken 30 different turns to get here.
Thank you deputy.
We're definitely looking for a local.
We should position black-and-whites in the area.
We might be able to spot the unsubs before their next hunt.
Garcia should pull surveillance footage of gas stations too.
With all this driving
they have to be getting their fuel somewhere.
I don't get it.
What?
These guys enjoy the thrill of the chase.
I mean all right I'll buy that.
But what I don't buy is them taking such a big risk.
Well they wouldn't let their victim loose
unless they were certain she couldn't get away.
So what would make them so certain?
Manpower.
It would take one person to drive the truck.
It would take another guy to
handle the spotlight to track her in the field.
Is that enough?
Not for me. I mean come on look at this place.
How can two guys guarantee that she's not gonna get away?
They drug her.
Maybe they think that's enough.
Or we're dealing with more than two unsubs.
Hey fellas.
Who's tagging in?
Did you really kill those girls?
I was protecting us.
You protected us so well The FBI's here.
What?
They got here this morning.
What do we do drug her and dump her?
I don't want any part of this.
Too late.
You're in just as deep as the rest of us.
We only had sex with them. We didn't kill anyone.
First of all a jury's not gonna call it sex.
They're gonna call it rape.
Second of all I told you I'd take care of it.
What did you think I meant?
I don't know. That-- that you'd drug them
to make them forget us or something.
Then let them go not this.
If we'd have let them go
we'd all be in jail right now.
Like it or not we're safe 'cause of what I did.
None of that matters right now. The FBI are after us.
What do we do?
So what if the feds are here?
We covered our tracks.
They can't connect the girls to us.
We still got our whole weekend.
I say we lay low
enjoy ourselves.
Party ain't over yet baby.
We know these guys are local
so we should be looking for anybody working fields or agriculture.
Only problem is
more than half of Indiana is farmland.
Garcia were either of the other clubs having theme nights
when the girls went missing?
Oh my gosh.
All of them.
Meredith Joy was abducted on Dollar Draft night
Amanda Frye on Ladies Night
And Kimberly Jukes on fantasy football friday.
So Reid you were right. They're targeting nights
that the clubs were at capacity
so they won't be easily recognized by the security cameras.
Reid.
Guys I think I found our two unsubs.
These guys have gotten dances from half the girls in the club.
They're very careful to hide their faces from the cameras.
And this guy seems to be
communicating with someone across the room.
But if his partner's sitting in the booth next to him
who's he talking to?
Garcia do you have another angle?
No luck head Hotch-o the other camera faces the door.
If there's a third unsub
we could be looking at a pack.
That makes sense. If these two in the booths are underlings
they would look to the pack leader to choose the target.
That's why they abduct the women from the parking lot.
Stephanie only knew about the first two men.
If there was a third she never would have seen them coming.
Garcia any luck with the DNA database?
Nothing in a 5-state radius
But I am opening my parameters to nationwide.
That is gonna take some time though.
That's the one thing we don't have.
We have 24 hours before Stephanie Wilson ends up
in a cornfield.
We might even have less than that.
What do you mean?
Two unsubs working toward a common goal is one thing.
Add a third and all bets are off.
We only found two traces of DNA.
One of them probably doesn't know about the murders.
The pack hierarchy will start to break down.
They'll question their leader.
And when that happens
the alpha will have to reassert his authority
and Stephanie Wilson will be the object of his aggression.
You should have told me.
After all we've been through I don't get why you'd lie to me.
I'm worried about Scotty.
You know him best. You think he'll run to the Sheriff?
No. He's been with us on two hunts now.
He knows he'll get locked up if he talks.
He'll stay loyal.
Let's hope so.
No no no!
You're gonna have to do a hell of a lot better than that girl
or we're gonna have a real problem.
What are you doing?!
God!
Aah! No!
Now dance!
Who's there?
I brought you some breakfast.
I'm not hungry.
Look if you eat I'll take off the blindfold.
But you have to promise not to look at me. Can you do that?
OK.
It's--it's OK.
Just keep your eyes closed.
You can open them now.
You're going to kill me aren't you?
No.
No it's just...
I don't know.
Please let me go.
I can't do that.
I don't want to die.
I don't want that either.
Then let me go.
I have a daughter. She's only 2.
Please.
I want to see my baby.
I'm going to do everything I can to get you back to her.
I promise.
You shouldn't make a promise you can't keep.
I was just saying that to get her to eat ok?
We need her to last don't we?
Whoops this must have fell off.
There we go.
Go wait in the truck.
Hold up.
You forgot something.
Stay with him.
I just can't believe someone from our community would be involved in this.
Don't underestimate a pack leader's influence.
These guys are being manipulated into playing his game.
We think at least one member of the pack
didn't know that the women were being killed.
Why here? Why now?
Each of the women was abducted on Friday night and not killed until Sunday.
So?
So why are they avoiding the work week?
Could be blue collar.
They like the game
but they can't let it interfere with their jobs.
I don't think so.
The pack strikes not only on the clubs'
busiest nights but also the cheapest.
They have a limited income.
They blend in with a young crowd
and they're unavailable Monday to Friday.
If one of them is from out of state
that would explain why they didn't start their killing until the summer was over.
What would?
We believe the men we're looking for are college students.
That's why the killings coincided
with the beginning of the fall semester.
This means they're most likely in their late teens to mid-20s
but don't rule out older students who transferred in
or enlisted in the military right out of high school.
Right now we're canvassing colleges in the area.
College students are impressionable kids
eager to fit in and find their place in the world.
This environment is conducive to the creation of a pack.
In a typical pack not all members are created equally.
There'll be a dominant one an alpha personality
who's most likely the oldest member of the group.
We believe he could be from out of state
and has likely committed similar crimes before.
The lieutenant will be fiercely loyal to the pack leader.
The alpha demands this.
He probably comes from a broken home
where he felt a loss the dominant was able to fill.
And finally we have the follower
the newest member of the pack.
He hasn't cemented his loyalty to the alpha
when already he's starting to question his role in the group.
It's unlikely this member is privy to the pack leader's ultimate agenda.
It won't be long before the dominant realizes the low man is a liability.
We need to find this man before the pack eliminates him.
How do we do that?
We drive a wedge between them.
Amp up the pressure.
This is our best chance of finding Stephanie alive.
How do they know where we go to school?
They're going to every campus in the area. Chill.
No.
I'm out.
No one's out.
No look ok?
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
I swear. Ok?
I'm gonna skip town.
Just calm down and be smart.
We'll figure it out.
I can't.
I just can't.
You brought him in you fix it.
I come bearing new information.
After I expanded my search nationwide
CODIS bounced back a DNA match to a series of rapes in Louisiana.
The dominant's done it before.
DNA matched only one unsub
but there's another sample in the Louisiana cases.
He had partners before.
Just not the same ones.
So he moves on when the pack dissolves.
Louisiana P.D. were crazy close to solving who done it
but then the rapes stopped. Two locals went missing
and they pinned the crimes on them.
I'm sure they didn't just happen to disappear.
Garcia do a search of local colleges
for students from Louisiana.
Yeah I'm gonna do that. Garcia out.
If he's killed his partners before he'll do it again.
But if he kills his accomplices
Stephanie Wilson is as good as gone.
Everything's gonna be all right.
How?
The feds are closing in on us.
Where are we going?
Michael has a plan.
I don't trust him.
You trust me don't you?
Yes. I trust you
But...Michael is unpredictable.
How do you not see that?
I've known him a lot longer than you have.
All right?
Have faith.
Why are we stopping?
We're ditching the truck and skipping town.
So what we're just gonna leave the truck in the middle of nowhere?
Yep.
Who's that?
It's just Michael coming to pick us up.
Why didn't you tell me?
Relax would you.
You ready?
Yes sir.
What the hell man?!
It's time you learned a lesson in loyalty Scotty.
I thought you were my friend.
What's this for?
Finish the job.
What are you talking about? He's learned his lesson.
Lesson's not his it's yours.
Finish him.
I'm not a killer man.
You are now.
No...
There's only one way out the brotherhood.
Don't do that.
No.
Don't do this.
Chris I'm your friend.
Chris don't please!
I'm sorry.
Please don't do this!
No no no!
Keep it together Chris.
Stephanie?
No. Male victim.
We managed to I.D. What was left of him.
Name's Scott Kagan.
He was a sophomore at Ernstrom college.
This might be one of our unsubs.
We said they'd eliminate the weakest link
and it looks like he was it.
The pack isn't just breaking apart
they're completely collapsing.
Rather than kill Stephanie Wilson
they decided to eliminate one of their own.
I mean how long until the lieutenant realizes
that he's expendable as well?
Hopefully soon. Stephanie may have gained another day
but that's not gonna last.
We have another problem
That they've changed pattern also. We're 3 counties away
from the normal disposal area.
Maybe they saw the patrol cars
at the usual dumping grounds and got spooked.
No not a chance.
My guys were parked at the edge of the field.
No one saw them.
Well then maybe they knew about the patrols in advance.
Scott Kagan looks like a super outcast.
Record of marijuana possession in high school
moved on to harder stuff in college.
Scott rushed the Fraternity Kappa Iota Phi
But was thrown out before he became a full member.
According to his school counselor records
he never really fit in anywhere.
Well not for lack of trying.
That's exactly what made him vulnerable to the alpha.
He didn't stand a chance. The dominant befriended him
and gave him a place to belong.
Garcia we know the pack leader is connected to the rapes
in Louisiana. Do any students at Ernstrom college
match to that area?
No such lucky.
I have cross-referenced with profile
location and criminal record. I have zilch.
Let's concentrate on the lieutenant.
He's our local connection.
Check the entire state
Fort Wayne to Evansville.
This guy knows the country roads like the back of his hand.
Like Scott both members were probably rejected
by Fraternities or athletic organizations.
Their actions must have been
deemed inappropriate to get them kicked out
Not just drug offenses but violence as well.
And they knew about the police traps.
At least one of the unsubs is connected to the investigation.
Do you think they have an inside man?
It's possible.
Run background checks on members of the sheriff's department
civilians and officers alike.
I'd like to speak to the sheriff.
This is sheriff Salters.
Hello?
Hello is anyone there?
Everything ok?
Yeah.
Fine.
Who you calling buddy?
No one.
Sheriff's office.
Now why'd you have to go and do something like that?
Sir I need to talk to you guys really really alone.
Ok. Hang on.
Conference room.
Go ahead garcia.
I ran a list of police officers
With children who go to Ernstrom College
And I cross-referenced
that with my flagged campus violent offenders.
What did you find?
My apologies sir
But Sheriff Salters has a son
That goes to Ernstrom
And the deeper I dig the more interesting it gets.
It appears young Salters has a sealed record.
Unseal it.
I already did that.
And it's blank.
What do you mean?
Everything in it has been erased.
Who'd know better that the FBI are here
Than someone living with a cop?
Do you think Salters knows?
How could he?
He's searching for a leak in his own department
Only he's the leak.
Garcia dig up everything you can
On salters and his son.
Yes sir.
Stay here.
Sheriff I need to talk to you.
I'm busy.
Then I can come back with a warrant.
Your son Chris has a sealed record
But I think I know what's in it.
He's been arrested for assault and probably drug violations too
And you've covered up for him.
That's why it didn't turn up in our initial search.
Are you a father Agent Hotchner?
Yes I am.
Well then you understand.
I couldn't let these uh these incidents
Ruin Chris' future.
I understand that if you run your home
The way you run your department
Then you bully your family the way you bully your officers.
I run a tight ship.
How long ago did your wife stop putting up with it and leave you?
You son of a bitch.
How many times have you hit Chris?
How dare you accuse me of abusing my son!
You call it discipline.
You hit Chris in order to maintain control
But you lost that control a long time ago.
Has he started to hit you back yet?
Don't tell me how to raise my son.
You've covered up domestic disturbance violations and drug offenses.
Have you covered up anything else?
What are you getting at?
Have you discussed details of the case with Chris?
Did you tell him about the checkpoints?
He was asking me about my day.
That was in order to escape detection.
I'm sorry sheriff your son's right in the middle of this
And if you don't help us find him
We're gonna lose him and Stephanie Wilson.
Hotch he's not in the dorms and he's not answering his phone.
You know if Salters inflicts physical punishment on Chris
Then it's highly unlikely he's the alpha of the group.
No based on what we know Chris wouldn't be the dominant
Nor would he have the confidence to lead.
But if the dominant protected Chris...
He'd have his unwavering loyalty.
Sheriff when Chris started Ernstrom
Was there an upperclassman who befriended him
Or who he looked up to?
Did he join a fraternity? Did he play on a sports team?
He didn't do this.
Garcia anything?
I'm searching sir.
Track team.
And Kappa Iota Phi.
That's what we've been missing.
Garcia expand your previous Louisiana search
To former Ernstrom students
Who fit our offender profile.
Narrowing narrowing...
Molto bene.
Michael Kosina of Louisiana.
Uh let's see. He was kicked out of Kappa Iota Phi
After questionable sexual conduct with a student in 2004.
The charges were dropped.
But the incident earned the fraternity probation
From its national chapter.
Michael Kosina. I met him.
He caused Chris' bar fight.
He did this to my son?
Were Kosina and Chris at Ernstrom at the same time?
Yeah. Chris was a freshman when he was a senior.
Michael dropped out a few weeks later
After he got into an altercation with one of his professors.
This type of dominant
Would definitely have issues with authority.
Tell me you got an address baby girl.
En route as we flirt baby.
Morgan wait until Sheriff Salters arrives.
He might be able to talk to Chris.
All right but you know hotch if that doesn't work
Prentiss could be our best shot.
True. The pack objectifies women.
They wouldn't know how to handle negotiating with one.
We gotta hit the road.
Why?
They're getting too close.
No they're not.
It doesn't matter. They're in our heads.
First Scott and now you.
You can trust me.
Really?
Look I didn't say anything I swear.
Doesn't mean you won't next time.
We're leaving.
Where are we going?
I don't know yet.
I have to make a stop first.
Trust is earned.
What are you going to do to me?
Don't worry baby.
I'm not going to let anything happen to you.
Ok? Stand up. Here we go.
Come on.
We do this we're free and clear.
Huh? No more pops telling you what to do.
We hit the road to a brand-new life
just you and me brother to the end.
To the end.
Away we go.
Chris Salters!
Michael Kosina!
FBI. Give yourselves up.
We want to negotiate.
The time for that is over son.
Oh I wish I was your son sheriff.
It wouldn't be my ribs getting bruised.
Christopher walk this way
and we'll work it out.
Don't you get it? He's done taking orders from you.
Sorry dad. Can't.
Prentiss go. Go.
Michael.
Chris.
My name's Emily Prentiss.
I'm holstering my weapon.
I just want to talk.
That's what they all say.
That's quite a feat
manipulating a cop's son into committing rape and murder.
Shouldn't we be talking about
how your fine ass is gonna get us out of here?
You wish.
Look around.
Everyone's guns are trained on you.
Not Chris. You.
No one wants to shoot a cop's kid.
But you?
I might shoot you myself.
You call yourself a negotiator?
Chris I know you're loyal to Michael. I get it.
He was there for you when you thought nobody else was.
Nobody was.
That might be true.
But you need to understand that
Michael's done this before.
Don't listen to this bitch!
She's trying to get us to surrender.
We should rush them now.
You don't want to do that Chris do you?
That's suicide for you.
Michael doesn't care.
He was gonna kill you
the moment things got tough anyway.
Just like he killed his last team.
What's she talking about?
Two men went missing
following a series of rapes
in northern Louisiana.
What do you think happened to them?
Is that true?
Were you gonna kill me too?
What do you mean too?
I didn't kill Scott.
You did.
You said that it was to protect us.
Us me. It's all the same.
It don't matter anyway.
We're not getting out of here either one of us.
I need to know you're with me.
To the end.
Well?
Too late.
What did you do?!
Put it down! Put it down!
It's over Christopher.
It's over.
I am not going to jail.
We'll get you a good lawyer.
We'll figure out a way to get your sentence reduced.
You'd like that wouldn't you dad?
A chance to play hero.
Son...
Well too late.
You don't get too win this one.
Medic we need a medic.
I had to son.
Sheriff?
It's time for us to go.
You know I keep asking myself what I did wrong.
How did my son become a murderer?
There's an answer that a profiler could give you
but you don't need to hear that.
And you don't need any criticism from me.
All I can say is that in my own life
I try to run a very tight ship at work
and then when I come home I try to give my son
all the love and compassion
and understanding that he deserves.
And I'm not saying this is your failing
but something made Chris vulnerable.
I know I've lost him.
I don't think you have.
It's going to take every connection I've ever had
to keep him off death row.
And after that he's going to need you more than ever.
Chris is lost.
But he doesn't have to spend the rest of his life that way.
What can I do?
Be there for him.
Make amends.
And help him do the same.
Good luck.
Thank you.
