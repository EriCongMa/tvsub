小寿星
生日聚会到此为止
we &apos;re going to san diego .
not for the surfing , huh ?
they &apos;re calling him the tommy killer .
6 women raped and murdered in their homes in the last 3 weeks .
6 in 3 weeks ?
that &apos;s a short fuse .
and getting shorter . the first 2 were 8 days apart
then the next 4 in 2 weeks .
rapid escalation .
do you think he &apos;s regressing to a psychopathic frenzy ?
no , he &apos;s too controlled for that .
see you on the plane .
why the tommy killer ?
you know the rock opera ?
使受害者的眼睛撑开
he wants them to see him .
and feel him .
french poet jacques rigaut said
&quot; don &apos;t forget that i cannot see myself
that my role is limited to being the one who looks in the mirror . &quot;
brenda samms was found yesterday by her children
when they got home from school .
she had been strangled with a thin ligature , possibly a wire .
no weapon left at the scene .
residue on the wrist and mouth
indicate that duct tape was used and then removed .
also not found at the scene .
brought it with him , took it with him .
他就开始在现场留下了讯息
this was on the mirrors .
&quot; fair lady , throw those costly robes aside .
no longer may you glory in your pride .
take leave of all your carnal , vain delight . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;ve come to summon you away this night . &quot;
it &apos;s a ballad from the late 1600s .
a dialogue betwixt death and a lady .
a 17th century ballad ?
不要夺去她的生命
what kind of person knows this ballad ?
are we looking for a literature professor ?
anyone with an internet connection , actually .
you should see what comes in when you type the word
&quot; death &quot; into a search engine .
reid , no wonder you can &apos;t get a date .
reid , you stay on the messages .
see if there &apos;s a deeper meaning .
it definitely looks like he ransacked the crime scene pretty well .
a lot of damage , nothing taken .
the eyes are the thing , the signature .
the behavior that isn &apos;t necessary for the murder ,
but necessary for the emotional release .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s there for .
there used to be a widely held belief
that the eyes record a snapshot
of the last thing a person sees before they die .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
people used to write poems about talking to death .
ballads .
whatever .
you think they &apos;ll ever run out of new things
正是我们所擅长的
captain griffith , task force commander .
sorry , we all get tunnel vision .
这是詹若 我们的联络员
i appreciate you coming out .
thanks , hope we can help .
hi , you &apos;ve reached the chandlers .
leave a message , and have a beautiful day .
what a good soccer game .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
when &apos;s mommy coming in ?
happy anniversary , honey . love you .
ready for bed , mom . will you tuck me in ?
使受害者的眼睛撑开
they &apos;re calling him the tommy killer .
it definitely looks like he ransacked the crime scene .
do you have a lot of homework , sweetie ?
mom ? mom ? mom , where are you ?
难道你没有听说过吗
you may as well be mute ... &quot;
creepy , huh ?
actually , conversations between death and his victims
是很流行的文艺体裁
yeah , creepy .
屡屡作案
extremely high @-@ risk victims at a high @-@ risk time .
he &apos;s confident in his ability .
looks to be about a 5 @-@ square mile radius .
so he probably has a vehicle .
you wanna see that crime scene ?
it &apos;s still taped off .
the husband won &apos;t go back inside .
let &apos;s go .
all right , so we need answers to these questions .
what does the evidence tell you about the sexual aspect ?
what kind of rapist is he independent of the homicides ?
i &apos;m on it .
it looks like what he &apos;s written at the scenes
are most of the first 3 verses of the same ballad .
most of ?
it &apos;s only one part of the conversation .
there &apos;s no &quot; betwixt . &quot;
death speaks , but the lady never answers .
maybe he feels like their bodies are answer enough .
very nice .
this profiling really works ?
it &apos;s a tool .
你就知道疑犯的所有情况
well , the scene &apos;s only part of it .
we also use victimology , precedent .
we can usually get a fairly clear picture of the guy .
our guys went over it pretty well .
i &apos;m sure they did .
local officers aren &apos;t trained to look for the things we look for .
what &apos;s that ?
hate , insecurity , fear , anger .
that &apos;s all at the scene ?
it &apos;s all in his behavior .
you know anything about our guy yet ?
yeah . he isn &apos;t gonna stop until he &apos;s caught .
you increased patrols in these neighborhoods
when the pattern was identified ?
after the fourth victim .
bosses cancelled days off , vacations .
但他还是又两度犯案
我是吉迪恩
there may have been another attempt 6 blocks from the station house .
attempt ?
the husband interrupted , and the attacker got away
but elle and i are headed over there right now .
well , we &apos;re already at the last crime scene .
let us know if you identify a suspect .
suspect ?
可能发生了另一起袭击事件
hey . hey . hey . where you going ?
over there .
well , units are already heading that way .
we can get more accomplished here .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
no . if there &apos;s an arrest
what we find here will help you prosecute .
the scene won &apos;t be pristine forever .
谢谢
hey , wait a minute .
the unsub went through the back , right ?
那扇满是提指纹粉的窗户就是了
gideon , i &apos;m going around the house .
ok , not that easy to maneuver .
that means i &apos;m a little bit athletic
all right .
i messed with something in here .
broken cappuccino machine .
却出现在了楼上 为什么
why would i take the time ?
lucky woman .
自己有多幸运
you &apos;re absolutely sure about that , mr. gordon ?
he was black and 6 feet tall .
i watched him run out that back door .
get a description out in the field a.s.a.p.
非常罕见
are they impossible ?
no .
then what &apos;s your point ?
only to provide you with information .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to her .
may i ask why ?
she &apos;s surrounded by men .
mrs. gordon ? i &apos;m elle .
would you like to go outside ?
it &apos;s all right .
we &apos;re just gonna go some place quiet .
here &apos;s where i got the china .
the silver .
i didn &apos;t take it , i broke it .
why wouldn &apos;t she hear me ?
because i did it after .
&quot; you may as well be mute .
there is no time at all for vain dispute
your riches , gold , and garments , jewels bright
必将受到新主人的照耀
i really don &apos;t know that much about him .
well , you don &apos;t have to .
just take a little time to collect your thoughts
to just sit here , breathe .
you don &apos;t want to ask me questions ?
not until you &apos;re ready .
i &apos;ll be right behind that doorway .
i didn &apos;t even know he was in the house .
is that common ?
very .
she had a workout video on .
step aerobics .
step aerobics ?
with the platforms ?
step up , step down , step up , step down ?
where &apos;s the platform ?
he spent a lot of time here .
what , so he vacuumed ?
i mean , there &apos;s no marks from the platforms .
a lot of time .
the broken things .
或者动弹不得了
碟子 花瓶 还有砸破的珠宝
symbols .
&quot; your riches , gold , garments , jewels bright .
your house and land must on new owners light . &quot;
her riches .
right .
有些东西虽近在咫尺
you just can &apos;t see it ?
yeah , usually right before a woman dumps me .
he slapped me from behind
he pulled me down on the floor .
可他力气太大了
and then my husband came home from work .
he screamed , and the man ran out the door .
he was a black man .
我只记得他的眼睛
when we were fighting , i kept staring him right in the eyes .
i remember thinking , &quot; if he &apos;s gonna kill me
then he &apos;s gonna have to look at me while he does . &quot;
and he just kept staring back at me through the ski mask .
a ski mask .
yeah .
it &apos;s all right . you did good .
the verses .
found something ?
not an answer , a question .
i found the full text .
he &apos;s pretty much following it to a t ,
at least the death side of the conversation .
but ?
why didn &apos;t he leave them at the first 3 murders ?
光死神的话就有10段
he &apos;s got plenty to work with .
but if it &apos;s not part of his signature
it isn &apos;t something that he has to do for an emotional reason
then , i mean , why start ?
第一次报道这个不明嫌犯
when ?
after which victim .
yeah , you got it .
what &apos;re you thinking ?
he wasn &apos;t getting enough attention .
the police department sometimes don &apos;t even realize
they &apos;re looking at a pattern .
yeah , until somebody tells &apos; em .
被发现后的第二天早上
才开始加强
yeah , the police didn &apos;t realize what was happening
he writes his verse , and--
and everyone knows that he was there .
是名黑人男子
black male ? that &apos;s cross racial . that doesn &apos;t happen .
what about herbert mullin ?
不同种族 不同信仰的人
but there was no sexual component to his crimes .
and he wore a ski mask .
this attacker wore a ski mask .
tell &apos; em we &apos;re ready .
for a profile ?
自己跟我们联系
the unsub brought the weapons with him
tape , glue , wire .
he did not leave them at the scene .
he took them when he left .
he has a kind of killing kit that he carries .
可能是技术类相关
which may involve the use of the hands .
the crime scenes are far enough apart that he needs a vehicle .
就像他家里一样
这几次袭击都是白天发生的
可能是公车或者卡车
we believe he watches the victims for a time
掌握作案的时段
you &apos;re not gonna catch him accidentally .
he destroys symbols of wealth in the victim &apos;s homes .
he harbors envy of and hatred toward people of a higher social class .
he feels invisible around them .
class is the theme of the poem
which he left at the various crime scenes .
at one point in the poem , the women attempts to bribe death
but he doesn &apos;t accept it .
he says this is the one moment when riches mean nothing
when death comes , the poor and the rich are exactly alike .
so he &apos;s poor .
probably middle @-@ class .
a decidedly lower @-@ class person would
stick out in a highly patrolled neighborhood .
混进了社区
why does he glue the eyes open ?
the unsub is an exploitative rapist .
会闭眼 侧过脸去
这就破坏了性幻想
for this type of rapist , the goal is more related to
而不是性侵犯这一过程
以及攻击性的话语 &quot; 我是死神 &quot;
this is a guy who , while being in control of the crime scene
almost certainly feels inadequate in the rest of his life .
他的所作所为
都算在自己头上的原因
都是一直控制着他的人的象征
and he wants that control back .
很强势的女人俯首帖耳
and a final point . he is white .
we have witnesses that identify him as a black male .
the attacker was black .
he is not the tommy killer .
mrs. gordon &apos;s husband came home
at the same time that he always does .
the tommy killer would &apos;ve known that .
and mrs. gordon &apos;s attacker wore a ski mask .
the unsub knows when he walks into a house
he &apos;s going to kill the woman who lives there .
if you &apos;re not leaving any witnesses ,
why wear a ski mask ?
and he wants the victim to see him anyway .
your attempted rapist is a garden variety
disorganized young man .
as the victim &apos;s age goes up , generally
the attacker &apos;s age goes down .
mrs. gordon is about 60,
which puts her rapist at about 20 .
and it takes years to develop the level of calm and sophistication
that tommy displays at a crime scene .
the rapist is far too young for that .
mrs. gordon told me that there &apos;s a young man
who delivers groceries to their home .
he fits a lot of what we &apos;re describing here .
又一无所知了
not at all .
may i see you in your office for a moment ?
you have a tip line for the public ?
yes .
可以窃听你的电话
he &apos;s gonna call us ?
well , he &apos;s gone out of his way to show you how scary he is .
报道一位6英尺高的黑人
of a 6 foot tall black man in connection with his crimes
he &apos;s gonna be furious .
furious enough to call .
later , man . see ya .
fbi . you &apos;re under arrest .
强奸未遂而被捕
what ? !
the fbi &apos;s behavioral analysis unit
was called in yesterday afternoon
by the san diego police department to assist in
the ongoing tommy killer investigation .
the unit is headed--
i can now announce that our office has assisted
in making an arrest in connection with the investigation .
that &apos;s all i can say at this time .
he confessed to mrs. gordon &apos;s attack
before we even got to the car .
thanks , elle .
should just make the 11 : 00 news .
did they get good footage ?
yeah , couldn &apos;t miss him .
good . now we wait .
contact garcia .
go for mrs. penelope garcia .
ready with the trap and trace ?
可不是吃素的
i am always ready .
with the awesome power i have in this room
来逮住这个变态色情狂
15 seconds ?
if that .
i can now announce that our office has assisted
in making an arrest in connection with the investigation .
that &apos;s really all i can say at this time .
turn that damn television down !
i &apos;m sorry .
we &apos;re still waiting , garcia .
god , i hate waiting like this .
do you think it &apos;s weird that i knew that ballad ?
你是怎么知道这么多的
but i &apos;m glad you do .
do you think it &apos;s why i can &apos;t get a date ?
you ever ask anyone out ?
no .
that &apos;s why you can &apos;t get a date .
detective martin .
line 6 , penelope . line 6 .
you stupid , incompetent sons of bitches !
我是死神 听到了吗
i am death ! you &apos;ll see now .
tomorrow , mark my words , you will see .
and while i &apos;m taking her , i &apos;m gonna be thinking of you .
anything ?
are you kidding me ?
i don &apos;t know how this is possible
足以查到地址
根本什么都没查到
let me work on this .
she said she got nothing .
nothing ?
we missed him ?
we have an undercover car for each of your teams
and the entire damn department out there , too .
或是辆保养不错的工作卡车
everyone knows .
all right , he might make a mistake today .
he &apos;s angry , and he probably hasn &apos;t
done the kind of surveillance he &apos;d like .
yeah , well , neither have we .
let &apos;s go , reid .
i &apos;ll bring the car around .
we &apos;ll find him .
that &apos;s the last place he watched .
that house .
morgan said the family hasn &apos;t moved back in .
probably never will .
it &apos;s the eyes .
excuse me ?
it &apos;s the eyes , elle .
just something not right about the eyes .
我同意
no . it &apos;s almost a classic move for
an exploitative rapist to force a victim to watch .
but ?
we &apos;re missing something about it .
it &apos;s 10 : 30 already .
all he said was tomorrow . he didn &apos;t ...
specify morning .
reid , this guy &apos;s gotta spend a lot of time in that house .
a lot . he needs it to be morning .
are we sure this is a good spot ?
3 of the victims lived within a block of this street .
it &apos;s the main artery through the neighborhood .
true , but 3 victims in the same block
could mean he &apos;s done with the area .
or that he &apos;s just really familiar with it .
and comfortable in it .
but then , on the other hand
离其他案发地点一英里以外
right .
god , i hate not having a plan .
we &apos;re looking for a needle in a haystack here .
actually , it &apos;s more like we &apos;re looking for
what ?
a needle would stand out in a haystack .
平平无奇的人
找一根特别的针
can i help you folks with something ?
fbi .
oh , sorry .
警方在这些小区加倍了巡逻人手
then double them again after the fifth and sixth .
yet our unsub still watched the houses .
how could he not have been seen ?
is that an oriole ?
no . a black @-@ headed grosbeak .
grosbeak ?
grosbeak , female .
orson welles said
all the birds that belong to our sex have prettier feathers .
&apos;cause males have got to try to justify their existence .
看看我 看看我
&quot; mommy , mommy . look at me . &quot;
yeah ?
25 ?
look at me .
ok .
garcia couldn &apos;t get a fix on the call
25个不同的分站打过来的
25 substations .
he wanted them to see him .
we established that .
he &apos;s meticulous . nothing is an accident .
he vacuumed .
seeing is about domination .
his creation .
he positioned everything exactly the way he wanted it .
and ?
if the eyes were so they could watch the attack
why are they all facing away from it ?
她们无法看到他作案的过程
he wanted them to see him afterward .
