Gabby
Want to get out of your seatbelt for me?
I did it!
You did?
Yeah, mama.
I always do it. It's so easy!
Is it so easy?
Let's go see your auntie Sue.
Oh, I'm so excited.
Where's Hillary the hippo?!
Ohh! Where is hillary the hippo?!
I don't know!
Oh, my goodness! You think I'd forget her?
Thank you, mama. Can I go play in that?
I don't know. You'll have to ask your aunt Sue first.
Well, who is this little house mouse?
It's me!
Hello, me. Nice to meet you. I'm Sue.
You're silly.
Can I go play in there?
Heck, yeah. I got it just for you.
You did? Where?
Neighbor down the street.
I gave him 10 bucks for it. Pretty good, huh?
Yeah!
You can go play.
Ok, look, Rodney is gonna kill me if I miss this plane,
so, here are some Mac and Cheese twofer coupons
and some cash.
It's not a whole lot,
but it'll get you through a couple drive-thrus.
And no sodas. Milk.
My cell phone's not gonna work on the cruise, I don't think,
so if something happens, just call the travel agent?
Oh, god, maybe I should just cancel this whole trip.
Are you kidding me?
You win an amazing raffle and you want to cancel it? That's crazy.
Honey, you're going and you're going right now.
I've just never left her for a whole week before.
Relax. Get drunk, get laid, we've got this.
Right, Gabby?
Yeah.
Wait, I'm coming out.
Come here.
Give me a hug.
I love you, and you listen to your aunt Sue, ok?
Ok, mama.
I...love...you!
Bye, I love you. Have fun.
Can we play in the house now?
Say bye, mommy.
Bye!
I love you!
Love you more.
We'll miss you.
You want to have some fun?
Yeah.
Ok. Let's be fairies.
You got your wings?
Yeah.
You need a jacket, honey.
It's cold.
I'm fine, Daphnie, thank you.
Oh, poor thing. Can't sleep again, huh?
Been away from her mama about a week.
Yeah, she's fine during the day.
It's just at nighttime is a bit of trouble.
I'm glad to see the quiet drives are helping.
Always worked with my babies.
Have a nice sleep, little one.
Night night.
Night night.
You buckled up.
Yeah. Ok.
Uh, milk, sorry.
Hey, slow down, shorty.
Hey, 6.50 on number 2.
There's a line, Willie.
Just turn on the pump, man.
Baby, you need a hand?
'Cause as you can see, I got very big hands.
I'm fine, thank you.
Sure is one fine little lady, though.
Help! Help! Somebody, help!
Help! Someone call 911!
Somebody help! The baby's gone!
Help! Call 911! My baby's gone!
Please call!
Please! Call 911!
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god! Aah!
Aah! Help!
It is now 3 hours and counting since 4-year-old Gabby Hoffer
was abducted from her cousin Sue Walsh's car.
Why would anyone leave a little girl alone in a car at night?
Sue told local authorities
that she was a couple blocks from her house,
she didn't want to wake Gabby up,
she was in and out of that mini mart in under 4 minutes.
That's a pretty tight window of opportunity.
Whoever took her must have been stalking them.
Is there a history of child abductions in this area?
No, but the local registry
shows a high concentration of sex offenders.
We have no time to waste.
We do have an eyewitness, but his recollection's
limited to a dark van that he saw pull up next to Sue's car.
That's pretty vague.
So we don't have a color
or know who was driving.
Are their surveillance cameras on the premises?
Yes, there was one camera, it's in the store, and it's ancient,
but the footage is being sent to the lab right now for enhancement.
SSA Canning is on scene
with the southeast regional CARD team.
They're conducting neighborhood and roadblock canvasses.
We all know what to do.
If this is a stranger abduction,
we've got fewer than 24 hours
to bring Gabby back alive.
It's often said there is no footprint too small
to leave an imprint on this world.
Garcia, where are Gabby's parents?
Away, but not together.
They're divorced.
Mom, Kate,
is coming back from a caribbean cruise with her new boyfriend.
And Doug, Gabby's bio dad,
is a long-haul trucker who is on the road.
And this is where bad turns to worse.
Dad has a history of drug problems.
Since Gabby's under 5 years old
and her father's whereabouts are unknown,
Statistics say he's more likely the offender
than the stranger abduction.
He could have been the one who stalked them and grabbed Gabby.
Morgan, you and JJ head over to Sue Walsh's house.
See if any of the neighbors have seen gabby's father lurking around.
All right. Got it.
A possible abduction
and an AMBER Alert out on a Gabby Hoffer...
5 hours and 23 minutes since Gabby was taken.
Witness pulled up to pump number 2 here,
saw the van parked there.
Blocked his view of Sue's car.
Said the brake lights were on.
The driver could have kept his foot on the brake
while someone else used the sliding door to grab her.
It'd be smart to use a partner out in the open like this.
We have 9 registered sex offenders within 3 miles.
Sometimes they work in tandem.
We have teams going door to door now.
That's good, cover your bases.
But it's the ones we don't know about
who are the most dangerous.
What's the word on the parents?
Mom and boyfriend Rodney are confirmed off conus.
They'll be at the P.D. soon.
We have any location on the biological father yet?
Still not answering his cell phone.
It's not pinging off any towers, either.
So he shut his cell phone off.
That's odd for a trucker.
Unless it's a countermeasure.
The dark van could have just been a transport vehicle
to get gabby to his truck.
You're thinking he waited for the opportunity to take her?
He has motivation given that he lost custody.
We should check rest stops for his truck as well.
The problem is Interstate 59 is just 3 blocks away,
and it goes to Louisiana, Alabama, and Georgia.
We've got the borders covered.
Nobody's getting out of here without a fight.
Agent Canning, can you get video footage for us from a 5-mile radius?
We need to see if there's any video of this dark van
coming or going.
Not much hope there.
Katrina took out a lot of the security and traffic cams.
They haven't been replaced.
Is Sue inside? We need to talk to her.
An agent drove her home and is staying with her
in case there are any ransom demands.
She's a wreck. Not sure you'll get anything new.
Excuse me.
All right. Blake, you and Reid stay with Canning's people.
If Gabby was a victim of opportunity,
then the unsubs didn't have a plan
and they could still be in the area.
Dave and I will go to the police station
and interview Kate and the boyfriend.
Is she awake?
Did you find Gabby?
No, not yet.
But we could use your help.
I'm Agent Jareau. This is Agent Morgan.
Mind if we have a seat?
Oh, I'm sorry. Have a seat.
So, um, when we handle these ca--
when we handle these cases,
we start by eliminating family
and work our way out from there.
So, do you have any brothers or sisters?
No.
Kate's the only family that I got.
She's more like a sister to me than a cousin.
Her parents took me in after mine died.
I'm so sorry. How old were you?
8.
I'm sorry.
It's all right. We know this is a tough time.
Did anyone take special interest in Gabby
since you've had her?
No. No.
I always had her right by my side of me...
except...
I was only gone like one second.
I got her to sleep finally and I didn't want to wake her.
There's nothing you can do about that now, ok?
You just need to focus on finding her.
So think back.
Was there a deliveryman? A service worker?
No.
A neighbor?
No, nobody.
I don't know, maybe everybody.
I mean, she's so nice. She smiles at everybody.
What about her father? Have you seen him?
Has he contacted you?
No. He's always on the road. He never calls.
Did he know that you were watching Gabby?
I don't think so.
Ok, Sue. Do you know anyone with a dark van?
No. No.
I'm sorry. I just can't even believe this is happening right now.
Well, you're the best at finding kids.
You're gonna find Gabby, right?
God, just tell me something,
'cause right now all I can tell myself
is I never, ever should have left her.
I need your help.
Anything.
Tell me about Gabby.
She's just about the sweetest little girl you've ever met.
And how long have you been seeing Kate?
Almost a year.
She's the best person I know.
Nearly eloped on that cruise, but we wanted Gabby there for it.
Has Gabby ever wandered off with anyone?
No.
A stranger?
No. There's just no way.
I warned her too much about that.
What about with someone she knew?
Like who?
Doug? He hasn't seen her for almost a year.
Oh, god.
Oh, god, you think that man took my little girl?
Do you know where Doug is right now?
He's on the road, somewhere.
Oh, god, he did it, didn't he?
He swore that he would get back at me for leaving him
and he's finally done it.
We don't know that.
But that son of a bitch is your number one suspect, isn't he?
How would you get in touch with him if it were an emergency?
He has two cell phone numbers.
One is personal and one is a company road one for emergencies.
Garcia, I need you to track GPS on this cell phone number.
601...
555-0181.
Think maybe she might know a thing or two
about what goes on around here?
Kind of late to be taking the trash out, isn't it?
They only come once a week and I don't want the house stinking.
You here to find Gabby?
Yeah. And we could use your help.
When's the last time you saw her?
When Sue took her for a ride.
A few hours ago?
Yeah.
I don't sleep so good anymore.
Any little noise wakes me.
Have you seen a dark van?
Not tonight.
But one came through the other day.
Think he's a plumber.
Can you remember the company name?
All right. Thank you.
She's seen a van.
Please tell me she's safe.
Not yet, but we've got a lead on a dark van.
It could belong to a plumber.
Check local businesses.
Well, that's hardly anything.
You've had less.
True.
Come on, baby girl, we need an I.D. and location right now.
Uh, there are 4 plumbers in the immediate area.
I'm pulling registrations.
Uh, white minivans are all the rage.
There's the Little Family Plumber.
They have a bluish van that's dark.
Run employee background checks.
Won't be hard. It's only the owner
and his nephew, Ian Little, 25.
He was released last year, for slinging bennies and heroin.
Where is he now?
Sleeping, I imagine.
I'm sending you his home address. There it is.
Hattiesburg P.D. got a call about an abandoned truck.
Found the phone under the seat.
Just got confirmation. Truck belongs to Doug Hoffer,
Gabby's father.
This is only 5 miles from the abduction site.
It was smart to leave it out here.
The property owners streamed the video
from that camera to my phone.
We have the truck being parked here sunday.
Did he walk back into town?
No. A little tough to see,
but he was definitely picked up by a dark minivan.
Tell me you have a license plate.
Yeah. Just I.D. the owner.
Ian Little.
What is he doing here?
What the hell happened to his face?
You know him.
Yeah. Doug used to buy drugs from him.
Do you think Ian helped him take Gabby?
What's his story?
Claims he hasn't seen Gabby in months
but admits that he picked up Doug on Sunday.
Well, he's smart to admit it, since we've got his mug
on surveillance cameras.
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Those look like second- and third-degree burns.
He hasn't had proper medical attention.
Looks infected.
Says he was trying to light his gas grill
and he left the propane on
while he went back inside to get matches.
He returned, struck the match,
and it blew up in his face.
Oh, that doesn't make sense. Propane dissipates.
This would take serious flames
to curl around and burn behind his ears.
Who gets those kind of burns who doesn't go to the hospital?
Someone who has something to hide.
There are no calls,
but Ian's cell pinged off of 3 cell phone towers
outside of town on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.
I sent you the locations.
Cell tower range and directionality
can be dramatically influenced by atmospheric,
electromagnetic, and traffic capacity variations.
Meaning?
A cell phone can travel to the same location
but ping off of different towers on different days
due to independent outside variables.
Garcia, can you see what's at this intersection point?
39-30 latitude,
negative 89-42 longitude.
Uh, that would be the old Little farm.
And that's Little, not like diminutive, but Little family.
That's where Ian grew up.
So Doug went missing 3 nights ago
and Ian's been at that farm each night since then.
Holy crappy childhood.
You can't make this kind of sadness up.
It's also the place where Ian's dad killed his mother
with a shotgun and then turned it on himself.
I'm Agent Hotchner. I don't have any time to waste,
so I'm going to give you once chance to answer my questions.
I know the story about how you got these burns is a lie.
These are the kinds of burns we see when people add gasoline to a fire,
like when they're trying to get rid of a body.
Is that what you did? Yes or no.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I also know exactly where you spent the last 3 nights.
You picked up Doug on Sunday
and you let him hide here, didn't you?
He waited there for a few days,
you drove him into town
in your van to try to abduct his daughter,
and something went wrong and Doug hurt Gabby
and you were left with a dead little girl
and you thought you knew how to get rid of her.
I want a lawyer.
That's all right.
I have my answers.
I have a team searching the farm right now,
and they will find the body.
Who the hell is that?
It's our main suspect.
Searched the entire property.
We found Ian's van in the barn.
No sign of Gabby anywhere. What have you got?
Coroner says Doug died from blunt force trauma to the head.
Then it looks like Ian tried to burn Doug's body here,
which, of course, was harder than he thought it would be,
so then he dumped Doug's body in the water.
Sounds like rage followed
by just about every disposal method that we know of.
Even wrapped the body, weighed it down with rocks.
Could it be remorse?
It's more like concealment.
We see it a lot
when there's a connection between the vic and the killer.
Coroner says Doug's been dead for at least 72 hours.
That would be the same day he got here.
So what did this guy do to get himself killed?
Let me make sure I understand, Agent.
You said that Gabby was never there.
That's right, she wasn't.
But Ian killed Doug.
He must have had something to do with taking her.
Let me talk to Ian.
I'm sorry, we can't let you do that.
Oh, but he will talk to me.
Well, oh, god, when Doug and I first got together,
we smoked a little weed with Ian,
and then I got pregnant with Gabby
and I realized that I needed to quit all that stuff.
You know, I--I wanted to be a good mom.
I'm just saying that Ian and I go way back,
and he will tell me stuff that he may not tell you guys.
Because, honestly,
him hurting Gabby just-- it doesn't make any sense to me.
I'm sorry, but Ian isn't speaking to anyone,
except maybe a lawyer.
I'm so sorry.
CARD Team found this on the interstate.
What is it?
It looks like Gabby's blanket to me.
Ask your client.
I have no idea.
I advise you not to waste my time.
Where is Gabby?
Where is she?!
I don't know.
I swear.
I'm sorry. I just ran in for a second.
I would never leave her like that.
Ok, I understand this is difficult,
but what I need you both to do right now
is focus on finding Gabby,
getting her back in your arms.
Can you do that?
Ok.
Excuse me.
The mini mart video's back from the lab.
I've looked through the whole thing. Sue's story holds up.
Fast-forward to Sue's arrival at 10:03 p.M.
Cashier was the only one inside until then.
Hold on.
Let me rewind.
Right there--is that Sue's shirt?
She didn't mention
walking to the door and then turning around.
How long before she actually goes in?
Two minutes later.
Maybe she was worried about leaving Gabby alone in the car.
Well, there were plenty of places to park
right in front of the store.
She chose the side. No windows, no lights.
She told us she didn't want the lights
or the noise to wake Gabby up.
Right, but as a woman,
especially one with a small child,
safety comes first.
It's instinctual to find a quick,
well-lit journey from your parked car to the door.
It could have been a trial run.
We see that in inexperienced criminals
who need to build up their nerve.
Wait a minute. You thinking she did all of this?
Go.
See if there's any recent contact
between Ian Little and Sue Walsh.
Scanning slimeball's cell now.
Not a lot of repeat numbers.
Trick of the trade, disposable cells.
Ok.
Oh, there are dozens of calls
to and from this number, though,
And I'm gonna cross-check it with Sue Walsh's home.
We have a match. Yeah.
They talked. They talked.
Here you go.
Oh, thanks.
Thank you.
Sue, we need a formal statement.
Would you mind coming with me.
Oh, of course not.
Did you ever have any hesitation leaving Gabby with Sue?
Well, why would I?
Like a mother's intuition thing.
Did you ever feel like there was anything wrong?
Sue didn't have a problem with it,
and Gabby's spent the night there before.
Why are you asking me this?
We're trying to put some missing pieces together.
Ok.
Do you know Ian Little?
Kind of. He comes into the diner a few times a week.
We've got phone records that show you talk to Ian...
a lot.
Please don't tell Kate.
I mean, she never would have let Gabby come over
if she knew that he was coming around.
Why is a smart girl like you hanging out with this guy?
He's better now. He's cleaned up.
And he's different with me.
I'm really good for him.
You lost your parents when you were young.
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, maybe it gives you the attention that you need.
Yeah, I guess so.
You say Ian's clean?
Is he still dealing?
No, uh----
I don't think so.
Then why would Ian kill Gabby's father?
Uh...I don't know.
Maybe it was an old grudge
or a bad deal or something.
Ok.
Now...
We need your full statement.
Ok.
Are you sure you'll be able to write with that hand?
Oh. Yeah.
Uh, Gabby broke a glass.
Kids.
Uh, what exactly am I supposed to write?
Just tell us what happened.
Ok.
We know that Ian picked up Doug on Sunday,
then he was killed.
What if they surprised Sue at the house?
And Doug was threatening to take Gabby.
They could have been trying to protect Gabby from him
and he was killed by accident.
Except they went to extravagant lengths to cover it up.
Ok, that may be true, but it still doesn't answer where Gabby is
or what anyone's motivation is in hurting her.
We can keep theorizing, but every minute we do
is a minute Gabby's out there.
Dave.
We want the truth from your client.
What are you offering?
That depends on whether he fully cooperates.
My client did not kill Doug Hoffer.
He only disposed of the body.
Prove it, and the AUSA has agreed to plead him
from murder to accessory after the fact.
He knows who did it.
That's hearsay, it's not proof.
She cut her hand when she hit him with that candle holder.
They were arguing by the front door.
She's my daughter, and I am going to see her.
Doug went in to go get Gabby out of bed.
Sue picks up this candle holder
and hit him really hard with it.
It sounded really bad.
It was heavy glass and it broke when she hit him again.
Her blood was all over.
Guys, over here.
So was Doug's.
She hid it in a shoebox in the closet.
Why would she keep the murder weapon?
She thinks she's too smart to get caught.
Are you all right?
Did you find Gabby?
What do you think?
Are we gonna find her?
Kate trusted you with the care of her child.
You were responsible for this little girl.
You had a duty to protect her,
and you failed,
miserably.
What happened to Gabby is all your fault.
You know nothing about what it takes to be a mother.
You're pathetic.
Aah! You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you!
Get off me!
Get off me! No!
No! Get off me!
Talk about taking one for the team.
What was that all about?
If she's a predisposed female offender,
a major indicator is uncontrolled rage when challenged.
I'd say she passed the test.
She has no criminal record, no history of violence.
They're very good at concealment.
They're also the rarest type.
They go after young children in their care,
and their offenses can be sadistic, brutal,
sometimes bizarre.
The blunt force trauma that killed Doug
says that she has serious violence issues.
Something must have triggered that rage.
Whatever it was, I'm afraid of what that means for Gabby.
I know Sue is not gonna talk to us,
but maybe she would talk to Kate.
She did that to you and you want Kate going in there?
Rodney, I've got to go talk to her.
She's restrained. I will be at the door.
There's nothing she can do physically to hurt her.
What is wrong with you?
You still don't get it, do you?
I trusted you.
And I trusted you.
What are you talking about?
When I moved into your perfect little house,
your perfect little street,
everybody told me that I lucked out,
that I got myself a good family.
Well, I had a good family. I didn't want yours.
What happened to your family wasn't fair,
but why would you take that out on Gabby?
At first I thought that it wasn't only me that he touched.
What are you talking about?
Where is Gabby?
Gabby's gone.
What?
Now you know how I used to feel.
Like there's no air left.
Where?
For a really long time,
I thought that's just how things worked in your family.
'Cause your dad liked me to sit on his lap,
till it got more than that.
I used to stay up late at night
to see if he opened your door, too.
But he didn't.
Just mine.
He always did say that I was his special little girl.
That's not true.
My dad never touched you.
He used to put me on the floor 'cause it was quieter.
When he was done,
I'd put the lightbug on and I'd go under the bed.
That's where I sleep, but not you.
You got all the good memories.
You're insane.
Maybe I am.
What does that make you?
You left your kid for 5 days.
All I know is that I will never
let mine out of my sight.
She'll be here in the summertime.
Oh, my god.
She mixed her past and present tenses,
which shows unconscious deception.
Have a seat.
Oh, god, she never mentioned Gabby.
And she said my dad-- oh, god.
Don't let her get to you. Your dad's a good man.
We all know she's lying.
She's never going to tell us where Gabby is.
You got her to reveal more than you know.
Kate's right.
Sue's never gonna tell us where Gabby is.
It's her final move to punish Kate.
She wants to inflict maximum pain upon Kate.
So you're thinking she'll do whatever it takes
to make Kate suffer and keep on suffering.
Not knowing what happened to your child
would be the ultimate torture for any parent.
But if Sue killed Gabby,
chances are eventually we'd find the body.
She'd need to find a way to get rid of her permanently,
without killing her.
Nothing's out of place.
In fact, all of Gabby's things are packed up
as if she was preparing to go back home.
That's strong evidence of a false allegation.
So all of this was arranged by Sue for what,
to get back at Kate?
You should have seen her with Kate.
She was relentlessly sadistic.
So Sue planned this with whoever was in the dark van.
But there doesn't seem to be any paper trail of it here.
And there's not electronic trail either.
There's no computer or cell phone.
Outside of a land line, this girl's living tech-free.
That's because she's hiding something.
Yeah. I agree.
Thanks.
I'm going to call Garcia.
Mama, is it even possible
for somebody to live completely offline these days?
Sure, if you live in an Afghani cave
or certain parts of New Jersey.
Other than that, not so much.
We can't even find an Internet connection
or any communication device in Sue's home.
What, so she's like old school? Snail mail? Cash transactions?
Yeah, but somehow she had to
connect with whoever actually grabbed Gabby.
A girl like that's gotta go online somewhere.
Well, she doesn't have much money. She'd have to do it cheap.
Well--ok, I started my illustrious career
on the web at the library,
because the computers and the Internet are free.
She could have done that using pseudonyms and anonymizers.
I--I know all this, but I'm gonna need some help
if I want to narrow it down quickly.
Ok, call Blake.
Maybe she got something out of Sue's written statement.
Good. Yes, and thank you. I'm on the trail.
Blake, I need your word wisdom
to help me track Sue's online activity.
Well, the only thing that stuck out
was her use of lightbug instead of lightbulb.
I heard her say it to Kate and noticed it in her statement, too.
Lightbug. Got it.
"I'll switch the lightbug off in the car so no one will see."
Where did you find that?
Backtracking now...
Oh, no.
It's an online forum
discussing a troubled 4-year-old girl.
Any identifying information on who she's talking to?
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.
该文件无法显示
No, oh, no. This is gonna be a dead end.
What happened?
Libraries that don't want Feds
tracking what their patrons are reading
or surfing on the web,
They erase their servers at the end of the night.
Can you recover the files?
If it were done,
t'were well it were done quickly.
Ok, it's still early.
Maybe they haven't written over the files yet.
本地IP 649.168.***.*82
Yes! Ok, I've got an IP address fragment and...
Gabby's not the only baby on that forum
that's being discussed.
Garcia, I need to know everything that you can find
about anyone communicating with Sue.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.
Oh, my god. Oh, no, no, no.
Sue gave Gabby away.
Who has her, Garcia?
I don't know. I don't--
Ok. I don't know, but I'm gonna send you
美国地下领养儿童市场
this online investigative report right now.
Read this, and I'm gonna find out who. I'm gonna find out who.
Disrupted adoptions?
That's what the people involved are calling it.
They're also referring to it as re-homing.
And it's been happening underground for some time now.
Until now, it's mainly been overwhelmed adoptive parents
of problem children from overseas.
Good people go on the site looking for guidance or services,
but bad people offer to take problem kids off their hands
as a last resort.
So they just give them away to some random couple?
Calling them couples is a bit generous.
The article talks about these people who pose as families,
But really, they're just freaks looking for access to kids.
And no one's keeping track of them.
Why isn't this illegal?
Well, 'cause it's a relatively new practice,
And unsurprisingly, no legislation's been written yet.
So how did Sue manage to give Gabby away?
She posed as Gabby's mother
and gave her to a woman
who claimed she knew how to deal with troubled kids.
I want my mommy.
Hush, Carly.
My name is Gabby.
If you cry, bad things will happen.
Garcia, we're out of time. We need something.
Ok. There are 3 families who responded to Sue's post.
Do any of them own a dark van?
There's a Nicole Jones.
She owns a blue '03 caravan.
She lives in a shack 20 miles south
of where you are off of Interstate 59.
Let's go.
Clear!
Clear!
Guys!
D-don't shoot me.
Where's Gabby Hoffer?
She's gone.
She's still not talking.
She must have panicked and gotten rid of Gabby.
Garcia, who else from the area answered Sue's post?
Uh...there's one woman, Michelle Fader.
She ran in the same sick circles.
And she owns an old van.
This Fader's a real winner.
She was evicted from her last known address.
They probably won't risk going back towards the abduction site,
which means they're headed southwest.
Let's go.
Ok. The woman I hope you're about to arrest
had all of her biological kids taken from her 5 years ago
because another child died while in her custody.
She was never charged?
Oh, no, she was, but for neglect.
She didn't spend a minute in jail.
Social workers haven't come by her house at all
because none of her kids are in her custody.
And they have no idea she's been finding new children online.
Those poor little darlings are being treated like trash.
They don't know that anybody cares.
We care. We care.
Garcia, widen your search
to any know male associates of Michelle Fader.
Yeah, will do.
Ohh. I got a picture of Fader with some guy
who could win Sleaze of the Century Award.
He's got his arm all possessively around this sweet little girl.
Run facial recognition software and get an I.D. on him.
Ok, I got a match. Michael Feehan.
He is the perv in the picture with Fader.
He's not in any registries,
but he has got a list of accusations.
None of them were proven
because all of the victims were too young.
Garcia, did you get the address?
Running it now.
Police, give me a reason.
What the hell's goin' on?!
Michelle Fader, you're under arrest for staging a child abduction.
I didn't do nothin'. Look, I was trying to help that girl.
You have the right to remain silent.
I am only trying to help that girl.
She wanted a fresh start.
Anything you say can and
will be held against you in a court of law.
She couldn't take care of her own babies anymore.
You have a right to an attorney...
I am trying to help that girl!
You have a right to an attorney...
What's gonna happen to my babies?
I've got Gabby.
And there are other kids back here.
Are you ok?
Can you take me home now?
Yes, sweetheart.
Ok, come on.
Up you go.
Mama!
Oh, my sweet baby!
I missed you, mama.
I missed you so much.
Why are you sad?
I'm not sad.
So those are happy tears?
Yep.
We're never, ever gonna leave you.
JJ...you ok?
They don't have any place safe to be.
It's not ideal, but they'll be in foster care
until they find a family.
Yeah, but how many more kids like that are out there?
That's a good question.
Hey, sweetness,
thought you might want to see something.
What?
Mmm, mmm, we're gonna go home now and you can...
have a good meal.
Oh, ho ho ho. I needed that.
