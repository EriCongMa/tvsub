making croissants seems daunting ,
but really it &apos;s as easy as making coq au vin .
to think it takes two days .
hey , julia childs , i could buy a tube of those crescent things
and serve &apos; em to you in 20 minutes .
no ! throw it to second ! come on !
w @-@ why are you yelling ? you can &apos;t change the outcome .
really ?
gee , i thought i could .
that would require crossing the space @-@ time continuum .
go get the hand vacuum
and clean up your couch crumbs .
ma , i &apos;m trying to relax .
okay , and we are trying to get ready for a guest .
help out .
come on , maura , you &apos;re gonna give yourself an ulcer .
all right ? it &apos;s not royalty . it &apos;s your mom .
ulcers are caused by h . pylori , a bacteria .
or critical mothers .
i &apos;m not critical .
am i ?
she &apos;s never been to my house before .
never ?
well , what do you do when she visits boston ?
we just usually go to one of my parents &apos; homes in europe .
those tulips are wilting already .
yes , i could see why you &apos;re so ashamed of this hideous place ,
and forcing her to stay in that disgusting guesthouse .
what are you talking about ? it &apos;s lovely .
wait a minute.if your mom is in the guesthouse ,
where are you staying ?
with you , of course .
fine , but just know i don &apos;t serve coq au vin .
i serve ... cocoa puffs .
i know .
rizzoli .
isles .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;m on my way .
i haven &apos;t even had a chance to pre @-@ order
the organic pig &apos;s trotters .
are those feet ? i &apos;m not eating feet .
i &apos;m gonna leave you the butcher &apos;s number .
sure .
come on .
you should change .
all right . i &apos;ll change in the car .
then i &apos;m driving .
oh , come on . i hate it when you drive .
well , i hate it more when you undress and drive .
bye , ma .
all right , okay , it &apos;s sort of a screwy hobby ,
but i used to love this rev war reenactment stuff .
i mean , it bugged me
that they wouldn &apos;t let women be minutemen , you know .
thousands of women served
as laundresses , nurses , seamstresses .
gee , how fun is that ?
all right , what do we got ?
probably a stupid accident .
before everyone realized he wasn &apos;t faking it ,
the whole thing was probably over .
just takes one gun nut smuggling in live ammo .
found his i.d. in his powder horn .
city i.d. gabe buckner , 27 .
he was a garbage man .
maybe it wasn &apos;t an accident .
maybe somebody wanted him dead .
perhaps it was someone who didn &apos;t like to recycle .
was that a joke ?
only if it &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s an odd @-@ looking entry wound .
what is that ? is that a musket ?
hmm . there &apos;s no exit wound .
hmm . unusually ragged edge .
so , stabbed from a bayonet ?
colonial militia didn &apos;t use bayonets till 1778 .
maura , shot or stabbed ?
or did somebody chew on his hip ?
oh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s from a bite .
uh @-@ oh . cavanaugh &apos;s here .
oh . this is a paid tourist attraction .
city &apos;s full of &apos; em ,
celebrating liberty days .
fascinating . he was a smithy .
blacksmith .
maura , it &apos;s pretend .
perimeter &apos;s secured . what next ?
i &apos;ll have a coffee -- two sugars , black .
oh . make that two .
oh , cappuccino , please .
but only if there &apos;s 1 % milk .
good thing you &apos;re not picky .
hey , i &apos;m trying to make detective ,
not become a barista .
bro , you know how many coffee runs i had to make
working my way up ?
nothing for me , but if you hustle those coffees ,
i &apos;ll let you help me with witness statements .
deal .
hey , i &apos;ll handle the media .
we don &apos;t want to panic the tourists .
for now , it &apos;s an accident . got it , people ?
yes , sir .
put your backs into it , men !
what the hell is this meathead doing ?
rizzoli , get him out of here ?
yeah .
move it forward !
ho , hey , ho , ho !
it &apos;s a crime scene . you can &apos;t be here .
i was merely attempting to move this artillery piece
out of your way .
commanding officer general ezekiel parker
of the 16th brigade .
i &apos;m martha washington .
let me see your driver &apos;s license .
sure . of course .
dwayne cravitz ? yeah , no wonder you went with &quot; parker . &quot;
it is such a pleasure to meet you .
dr. maura isles .
professor cravitz is a leading authority on colonialism .
i &apos;m a huge fan .
you &apos;re a huge fan of colonialism ?
no , of course not .
he &apos;s also the chair of american history
at boston cambridge university .
good doctor , your words flatter me .
i like your pretend accent .
it &apos;s quite authentic .
colonial americans spoke rhotic english
in a variety of regional dialects -- scots @-@ irish ,
west country -- - where is the coffee ?
i got something better .
detective rizzoli , this is maggie mcgee .
that &apos;s her boyfriend over on the ground .
i know this is difficult ,
but we do need to ask you some questions .
are you kidding me ?
i want these war freaks to pay for what they &apos;ve done .
was your boyfriend having any problems
with the other reenactors ?
i &apos;ll say .
was there anyone specific who might have wanted gabe dead ?
oh , yeah . all of them . they called him a &quot; farb . &quot;
&quot; far be it from authentic . &quot;
just &apos; cause his uniform was a poly @-@ cotton blend .
even his buttons weren &apos;t historically accurate .
you believe that ?
buttons ?
just when you thought you &apos;d heard every motive .
penetrating injury to the articular surface
of the femoral head .
he bled out .
huh . say , doc , i was ...
i was wondering if ...
are you all right ?
yeah .
buddy of mine &apos;s been having some chest pain .
didn &apos;t you just have a physical ?
how &apos;d you know it was me ?
doctor says i &apos;m fine . so why am i short of breath ?
i &apos;ve been eating better , getting some exercise ,
and i feel worse .
are you experiencing dizziness , light @-@ headedness ?
maybe a little .
i want you to see a cardiac specialist .
ballistics unit checked the reenactors &apos; weapons .
they &apos;re all replicas .
there &apos;s no sign anyone used live ammo ,
at least not in the muskets .
some kind of a projectile perforated the iliac artery .
copper @-@ jacketed --
not from 1776 .
sheared off . looks like a .22 caliber to me .
there appears to be a dark granular substance on the exterior .
transfer . that bullet ricocheted .
so our shooter wasn &apos;t aiming at old gabe here .
well , if gabe was collateral damage ,
then who was our gunman trying to kill ?
so , we could be looking for a sniper .
wonder why he just shot once .
why &apos;s he shooting once
if gabe wasn &apos;t his target ?
there are 48 reenactors -- 24 patriots ,
24 redcoats -- all of them were at the mock battle .
these guys are all clean . no one has a criminal record .
we didn &apos;t find any other bullets at the crime scene ?
just the one dr. isles dug out of the dead guy .
so again , if our shooter missed his target ,
why didn &apos;t he take another shot ?
not like he couldn &apos;t .
loud mock battle -- easily cover the sound of gunfire .
what the hell are you eating ?
bean chili and a side of zucchini .
don &apos;t ride with him . oof !
since when did you become a vegan ?
a who ?
more like a what--
it &apos;s the practice of eliminating animal products from your diet .
give up burgers ?
that &apos;s like asking me to give up my sailboat .
how can you be this big animal lover
and eat their flesh ?
i &apos;m a complicated man .
what do you got ?
i &apos;ve identified the substance on the bullet .
it &apos;s ferrous oxide .
iron . look at the ping mark .
well , i can &apos;t confirm without more tests .
okay , folks , we got confirmation .
the bullet that killed gabe ricocheted off this iron cannon .
now , if we can figure out who was standing around the cannon --
we can figure out who the shooter was aiming at .
laser will help us determine where the shot came from .
let &apos;s go .
online shoe sale about to close ?
i &apos;m plugging in empirical data
to back @-@ extrapolate the pre @-@ impact orientation of the bullet .
okay . see that laser ? it does the same thing .
i &apos;m very good at trigonometry .
what a relief .
so once i input the type of bullet ,
approximate the density of the cannon ,
it appears the shooter was 243.84 centimeters off the ground .
what , you mean up there ?
excusez @-@ moi .
there we go .
okay , can you give me a boost ?
o @-@ okay .
maura , no .
frost !
i can get the crime @-@ scene techs here , all right ?
oh , no , i was best tree climber
year 6 at my boarding school .
detective frost , can you hand me my kit ?
yeah .
here you go .
you look ridiculous .
i &apos;m collecting forensic evidence .
give me ridiculousness or give me death .
jokes are supposed to be funny . remember , thomas paine ?
patrick henry .
hey , found something .
frankie , give me your hat .
don &apos;t you want an evidence bag ?
no . give me your hat .
come on .
hey . hello , starsky .
starsky ?
we &apos;re looking for a sniper who &apos;s shooting people in public parks .
you want to hurry it up , sergeant do @-@ little ?
well , come on , jane . starsky deserves a chance .
i found something !
what is it -- hutch , the injured squirrel ?
torn skin embedded in the bark .
there &apos;s something else in there .
hold on .
thick , dark @-@ brown , oily substance .
cosmoline . gun oil .
used for storing and preserving firearms .
that &apos;s a good position for shooting someone .
but why &apos;d he fire only once ?
he didn &apos;t .
found a second shell casing .
stove @-@ piped . that &apos;s why he stopped shooting .
his gun jammed .
okay , who was standing around that cannon ?
professor , i need to know who was positioned
in the immediate vicinity of the cannon .
our regiment engages in improvised tactical demonstrations .
so spectators feel a certain authenticity .
which means you don &apos;t know .
war is hell , detective rizzoli .
pure unadulterated chaos .
good tip .
uh , were there any problems between your members ?
my men are after freedom , not each other .
enoch byrd is a farmer .
josiah hall is a cobbler .
and archibald chestnut &apos;s a blacksmith .
archibald was a garbage man named gabe buckner ,
and he &apos;s dead , which is why we &apos;re here .
nicole , you may , uh , put the tray on the desk .
sugar was a true luxury item in 1774 .
imagine what they would have charged for splenda .
none for me , thank you .
please .
it &apos;s part of nicole &apos;s education as a phd candidate .
i &apos;m professor cravitz &apos;s teaching assistant .
please , allow me to serve you .
women were domestic slaves during colonial times .
thank you .
laundry lady , nurse , seamstress ,
or domestic slave .
so many choices ,
and they all sound like so much fun .
i teach my students that the way to understand
a culture fully is to experience it firsthand .
i &apos;ll have some . thank you .
i &apos;m pretty sure there are laws against slavery .
shh .
thank you . that &apos;ll be all .
do her parents know they &apos;re spending $ 50,000
for their daughter to learn how to serve tea ?
$ 57,600 .
it &apos;s an honor , jane .
you know , only top students are offered teaching @-@ assistant positions .
well , it &apos;s a massive waste of their money
and her i.q. points .
hello ?
what ? !
no !
yes !
um , o @-@ okay .
okay . thanks .
bye .
u.p.s. lose your shoes ?
no , it &apos;s my mother . she &apos;s a day early .
she caught a ride on a friend &apos;s jet .
those pesky jets .
oh , my god . what am i gonna do ?
well , first of all , stop doing that .
pig &apos;s trotters take two days to marinate .
oh ! and we &apos;re in the middle of a case . what do i do ?
vasoconstriction . hypocapnia .
okay . please , get a hold of yourself .
come on .
all right .
can you find a nice place in the kitchen ,
maybe play a little soft music ?
of course , sergeant . starsky ?
yeah , he &apos;s in good hands with me .
hi .
getting some coffee .
caffeine increases blood pressure .

no . he took a personal day .
good . can you cook a three @-@ course dinner here ?
eleven .
eleven ? !
hors d &apos;oeuvres , potage , poisson , entre --
sandwiches , peanut butter and fluff , or take @-@ out .
what about releve ? sorbet , roti , legume --
oh , sure , maura . we &apos;ll just call stanley in .
okay . chef renault . chef renault from maison de la mer --
he will help . you just tell him that it &apos;s for me .
sure .
goodbye .
oh , hey , frankie . got your hat .
thanks .
just got off the phone with a reporter
who &apos;s about to go live with the sniper story .
oh , come on !
every nut job with a dialing finger
is gonna be calling in with a tip .
yeah . it &apos;s gonna be a long night .
i better let the boys upstairs know about this .
crap . i &apos;m supposed to be at maura &apos;s .
hey ! you want some more practice at detective work ?

i want you to answer my phone for me .

boston homicide . korsak speaking .
my mother is famous for her dinner parties .
the apple didn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
oh , no . i couldn &apos;t possibly live up to her .
i mean , she &apos;ll spot take @-@ out in a second .
stop worrying ! you &apos;re the perfect daughter .
and you &apos;re late .
oh , i &apos;m not perfect . darn .
cannolis .
what are you doing ?
we already have dessert .
besides , cannolis aren &apos;t sophisticated .
well , neither are we . i got &apos; em for you .
you got them for me ?
yeah .
you &apos;re the perfect daughter .
okay .
go .
okay . don &apos;t worry .
you look beautiful .
hello , mother .
hello , darling .
you look well .
thank you .
country mice , meet city mice .
oh , my god . she &apos;s gorgeous . stand up straight , jane .
oh , crap . i got cannoli oil on my shirt .
hello !
hello !
next month , i &apos;m going to be lecturing in stockholm , sweden ,
on the objectification of the female form
in post @-@ war modernism .
i find that fascinating .
what do you know about post @-@ war modernism ?
i know a lot about the objectification of the female form .
good point .
elbows off the table .
what ? oh . i thought i was perfect .
did i tell you that
your father is going to join me in zagreb ,
for the german expressionist festival ?
that &apos;s so great that you found time in your busy schedule
to come to boston and visit your daughter .
oh , well , i &apos;m actually here for an installation opening .
oh . what are you installing ?
sorry ?
remember when i told you
about my mother &apos;s modern art installation ?
let &apos;s have dessert .
i made poire belle helene -- your favorite .
try the cannoli . they &apos;re my ma &apos;s favorite .
je m &apos;excuse , mais je suis très fatigués .
she says she &apos;s sorry .
she &apos;s tired . yes , i know .
i didn &apos;t know you spoke french .
i read body language .
it was lovely to meet you both .
you too .
um , i thought you were staying .
i @-@ i prepared the guesthouse for you .
darling , didn &apos;t i mention
that the gallery organized for me to stay at the ritz ?
and i already checked in .
of course .
but i will see you tomorrow evening
for the welcoming dinner , and you &apos;ll be my date .
sounds lovely .
please come to the opening .
just call the gallery and have them put you on the list .
the list ? yeah , sure .
bonsoir .
bonsoir .
ma .
wow . she is ...
so , uh , put together .
she &apos;s hard to get to know .
well , i think i got a pretty good idea .
ma , really , with the pots and the pans .
cincinnati can hear you .
see , you could have that for a mother --
nosy and loud .
and warm , involved .
grass is always greener .
you know , i used to dream that i was adopted .
really ?
yeah .
and my pretend mom was chic and glamorous and educated .
i always wondered what it would be like to have a mother
who cut the crusts off my sandwiches .
annoying .
rizzoli .
where ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
come on . we got another sniper shooting .
oh , god .
same casing as our rev war shooting -- .22 caliber .
if it &apos;s the same shooter , what &apos;s he doing here ?
i don &apos;t know , but we got another dead man .
he wasn &apos;t shot . he died of cardiac arrest .
that &apos;s still murder .
i &apos;ll do what i can to play it down .
how are we gonna play down a sniper on the loose ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you okay ?
yeah . heartburn .
as you can imagine , liberty days are really taking a beating
because of all of this , and officials say
that it &apos;s fear over the boston sniper
that &apos;s keeping people in their homes .
the big question now is where is this guy gonna strike next ?
&quot; boston sniper . &quot; come on .
i think they should call him
&quot; the sniper who couldn &apos;t shoot straight . &quot;
get it ? because he keeps missing ?
yeah . that &apos;s a ... good joke , maura .
really ?
well , there &apos;s no indication of cardiac disease .
the stress from the gunshots triggered a heart attack .
great , so we can charge our sniper with two homicides --
one by ricochet , one by fear .
who is this guy ?
you know , snipers shoot to kill .
this guy &apos;s missed people both times .
is he trying to send a message ? what ?
message is perfectly clear -- &quot; i need target practice . &quot;
okay . you do your job so i can do mine .
yes . of course , detective .
maura , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not you .
is it your mother ?
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s hard to have her here
and not see her .
you know , when i was little ,
i wanted to be with her all the time .
i wanted to be on mars -- alone .
&quot; jane , did you do your homework ? &quot;
&quot; jane , did you clean your room ? &quot;
&quot; jane , jane ... &quot;
she lives to hover !
woman was a helicopter mother
before they even invented the term .
come on .
let &apos;s get you ready for your artsy @-@ fartsy dinner
with your globe @-@ trotting mother .
got the ballistics back .
definitely the same ammunition in both shootings .
get this --the bullets are at least 30 years old .
that &apos;d explain why the gun jammed .
ammo &apos;s too old to trace where it was purchased ,
but look at the ballistic &apos;s fingerprinting .
ar @-@ 7 armalite rifle , old too
yeah . air force issued them to pilots between &apos; 59 and &apos; 73 .
it &apos;s compact , three @-@ piece ...
easy to smuggle into a rev war reenactment
without anybody noticing .
it &apos;s a long shot , but check the military records .
on it .
my mother
my mother
hello ?
hey , ma .
what &apos;s up ?
sure .
all right . calm down .
of course .
okay . i &apos;ll be right there .
bye .
my mother &apos;s having a bird emergency .
mine &apos;s changing dinner plans .
come on . let &apos;s go help .
oh , i went to go check up on starsky
after the lunch rush .
you took care of a sick parakeet around food ?
of course not !
i put him by a sack of yams in the pantry .
you &apos;ve got to help him .
sergeant korsak will never forgive me
if something happens to him .
can you get me a bowl of hot water and some towels ?
can you really save him ?
no .
i just didn &apos;t want your mother to see him die .
looks like avian flu .
avian flu ? ! what the hell ? !
well , you can only contract it if you ingest his feces
or give him mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth .
stop .
korsak &apos;s here .
hey . any break in the case ?
maybe .
rev war reenactors are gonna give gabe the garbage man
an 18th @-@ century wake tonight .
great . okay . we should go .
uh , yeah , yeah . i &apos;ll catch up with you .
i just need to check something .
in ... the kitchen ?
oh , all right . it &apos;s starsky .
it &apos;s cold up there , and frost doesn &apos;t like him .
he can feel it .
well ... it &apos;s a bad time .
uh , ma is giving him a bird bath .
oh . but the wake , we should go .
ah , well , we got to wear period costumes , or they won &apos;t let us in .
i have wonderful contacts at the historical society .
well , no , you can &apos;t go . you have dinner with your mom .
oh , no , you don &apos;t .
she called to cancel , didn &apos;t she ?
it &apos;s not her fault .
the dinner was a private affair -- no guests .
you &apos;re not a guest . you &apos;re her daughter .
you should come with us .
okay ? it &apos;d be great to have your ...
historical society contacts .
yeah . see ya .
where &apos;s starsky ?
he &apos;s dead ?
and you put him in your -- ugh .
where &apos;s ma ?
i told her i &apos;d take care of him .
you lied .
no . no , i just didn &apos;t say that ...
i was &quot; taking care of &quot; his funeral arrangements .
i can &apos;t believe i let you talk me into wearing this .
i don &apos;t think this thing &apos;s been washed since 1776 .
you &apos;re not used to the linsey @-@ woolsey fabric .
i told you to wear the silk polonaise .
oh , yeah , the whale bones digging into my boobs
would have been much more comfortable .
the wig &apos;s kind of scratchy , but we totally blend in .
yeah . totally .
you &apos;re just in time . we &apos;re about to begin the eulogies .
the victim &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s here .
let us raise our tankards high ...
in memory of a great and noble ...
garbage man .
... spirit .
it &apos;s like we &apos;ve stepped back in time .
maura .
18th @-@ century beer sucks .
you made a joke !
the crimson fountain has opened .
let every man gird himself for battle ,
but be not afraid , for god is on our side .
gun !
go , go , go !
nothing . you ?
no .
who was he after ?
i think we got a witness .
you saw something ?
oh , yeah . the whole thing .
i go out for a smoke , and all of a sudden ,
there &apos;s all these bangs , like ...
bang ! you know ?
the gunshots .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
so i look up , and there &apos;s this car speeding off .
great . okay . so you saw the car .
oh , yeah . i got a good look at it .
it was white .
the most popular car color -- great .
i &apos;ll pull the surveillance footage --
compare it to the other crime scenes .
yeah . get everybody in b.r.i.c to help .
look for every white car in the area near the shootings .
thank you .
he starts by shooting at a group of reenactors at olmstead park .
then he goes after shoppers on newbury street --
seems random .
then he tries to hit the reenactors again at the wake --
not random .
but the three shootings don &apos;t make sense .
what if the newbury street shooting was staged
to keep us off the reenactors ?
so he could come back and finish the job at the irish bar ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
i &apos;m also thinking we should find this guy
before he strikes again .
think we just got lucky .
got a white chevy that was in the vicinity of olmstead park
during the rev war reenactment .
that same car was also near the irish bar .
nice work .
car &apos;s registered to kathleen dunn of dorchester .
she &apos;s got a record -- food @-@ stamp fraud .
doesn &apos;t sound like a killer . let &apos;s go talk to her .
we &apos;re looking for kathleen dunn .
she &apos;s inside .
who are you ?
boston homicide , ma &apos;am .
benjamin ! get in the house -- now !
kathleen ! get your butt out here !
homicide ?
ah , the virgin mother and all the saints ,
what the hell she do this time ?
just want to talk to her .
is that your car ?
why ?
routine follow @-@ up . that &apos;s all .
i don &apos;t know . maybe it is . maybe it isn &apos;t .
you always have to have such a smart mouth . answer the damn question .
why don &apos;t you mind your own business , ma ?
why don &apos;t you lose the mouth ?
take her off my hands .
i thought my mom was tough .
save it .
you &apos;re not making a personal connection ,
and i &apos;m not spilling my guts .
you people are fishing .
we &apos;re being polite , ms. dunn .
we happen to know that car is registered to you .
we can and will get a search warrant .
if you had enough to get a search warrant ,
you &apos;d be handing it to me .
gee , you think she knows the system ?
that kathleen is one smart cookie .
she knows we don &apos;t find probable cause ,
we &apos;re not getting near her .
she goes after the same group twice ,
then stages a random shooting .
she &apos;s either after somebody in the group ...
or she &apos;s a whack job who enjoys watching us run around .
your mother &apos;s a regular florence nightingale , jane .
it &apos;s a miracle what she did . starsky &apos;s never looked better .
starsky &apos;s better ?
you look surprised .
me ? no .
yeah , she does have a healer &apos;s touch .
yum . what are we eating now ?
what is that , dirt @-@ covered styrofoam ?
oh , low @-@ carb , gluten @-@ free , high @-@ fiber .
ew . no , thank you .
why are we so fancy ?
i am going to my mother &apos;s gallery opening .
wow . she gonna put you on the list ?
we can get in .
who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
oh . how long have you been eating these ?
couple weeks .
part of my whole new health regime .
it &apos;s not a heart attack , sergeant .
what ?
what ?
it &apos;s gas .
given the fiber content , i imagine quite a lot .
he &apos;s been making enough to float the hindenburg .
hydrogen gas was unfairly blamed for that .
human gas is actually a mixture --
hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane .
most people produce about a half a liter a day .
well , exactly how much fart gas is korsak making ?
probably twice that amount .
okay , would you rather i had a heart attack ?
just stay away from those crackers and beans ,
and you &apos;ll be fine .
i was hoping you would go to the installation with me .
oh ... god , maura , i @-@ i wish i could ,
but ... no .
she -- she loves modern art .
you know what , jane ? we got this .
you go .
yeah , go .
we know how much you like these fresh ideas
and crazy colors and cubes and things .
oh , i &apos;m so glad you &apos;ve opened your mind to it .
yeah .
you two have fun , now .
thanks , guys .
how did starsky make such a miraculous recovery ?
luckily , the pet store carries parakeets .
i &apos;m sorry . this is a private gathering .
oh . this is dr. maura isles .
she &apos;s the artist &apos;s daughter .
yeah .
really ?
she couldn &apos;t even be bothered to put you on the list ?
she was busy . she said she &apos;d try .
yeah . i don &apos;t see you .
you see me now ? detective jane rizzoli .
yeah . go ahead .
hanging water bottles is art ?
it &apos;s an iconic representation of the deconstruction
of our food chain as a symbol of neo @-@ urbanity .
i could do that .
yes , but then it wouldn &apos;t be art .
hello , darling . you made it .
sorry we had to crash .
your daughter wasn &apos;t on the list .
oh , sorry . sorry .
mother , it &apos;s exquisite .
it &apos;s both witty and full of pathos .
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
oh , it is .
so nice to see you again , jane .
you too .
maura , would you mind getting us something to drink ?
i &apos;d love to get to know your mother better .
um , sure .
excuse me .
nice of you to come .
thank you .
i love your hanging water bottles .
they make me feel very guilty ,
and i &apos;ll never buy water again .
i @-@ i can see why maura likes you .
you &apos;re direct . it &apos;s kind of refreshing .
i &apos;m protective . maura &apos;s my best friend .
i sense that there &apos;s something you &apos;d like to say to me .
yeah . there is .
i don &apos;t like seeing my best friend hurt .
you think i hurt her ?
not staying with her , canceling dinner ,
&quot; forgetting &quot; to put her on the list of your installation ?
yeah , i think that hurts her .
she &apos;s the chief medical examiner .
she has her own life .
you &apos;re both out there working an important case .
it &apos;s all over the news .
i don &apos;t want to be in her way .
she must know how proud i am of her ,
how much i love her .
not really the signals you &apos;re sending .
it seems to me like you were too busy
while she was growing up ,
and now you &apos;re blaming her for being too busy --
i was -- i was never any good at it .
at what ?
being a mother .
i feel like i just ... i missed so much .
why don &apos;t you just tell her that ?
so sorry to interrupt ,
but our patrons are waiting for your speech .
would you excuse me ?
korsak . what do you got ?
found a connection between the rev war group
and kathleen dunn .
she was cravitz &apos;s t.a. at bcu .
kathleen dunn went to bcu ?
yeah . on a full ride .
she dropped out as a freshman
a month after she filed a rape charge .
anything to it ?
seems like it .
campus police did a rape kit ,
but it was never processed .
did she name her rapist ?
yeah . cravitz .
all right . thanks . i &apos;ll be right there .
jane , what is it ?
well , it seems like 18 years ago ,
our suspect claims that she was raped
by one of the rev war reenactors .
which one ?
professor cravitz .
this is bullshit .
you better not have torn apart my house .
nobody tore apart your house , kathleen .
we did find these , though .
valedictorian .
full scholarship to bcu .
everything going for you .
until you became professor cravitz &apos;s intern .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
you filed a rape charge against your professor ,
but you didn &apos;t pursue it .
that was a long time ago .
we have your stepfather &apos;s military records from 1967 .
he was issued an ar @-@ 7 armalite rifle .
fires .22 @-@ caliber bullets ,
same as our shootings .
why , kathleen ?
why go after cravitz 18 years later ?
i &apos;m not saying he didn &apos;t deserve it .
why try to kill your rapist now ?
you worried about your house ?
i guarantee we will turn your life inside --
i wanted to change history ...
but you can &apos;t .
that man ruined my life .
jane ! i got the dna results back
from the skin that we found on the tree .
yeah , we just got a full confession from kathleen dunn .
but the dna was male .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes .
my gut said that was too easy .
nobody rolls over that quickly
unless they &apos;re covering for someone .
this is not your brother , kathleen .
yes , it is .
ben is your son .
he was born nine months after you reported being raped
by your professor .
ben doesn &apos;t know the truth .
he will never know .
he knows , kathleen .
he knows you &apos;re his mother
and dwayne cravitz is his father ,
and that &apos;s why he tried to kill him
at the rev war reenactment .
he &apos;s smart . tried to throw us off the trail at newbury street .
until he could try again .
and that &apos;s when he fired at cravitz outside the irish bar .
no . no . ben has an alibi .
his friends were throwing him a going @-@ away party .
i can prove it .
you figured out what ben was up to --
you made sure he had an alibi .
because you knew he wouldn &apos;t stop
until he killed his father .
and that &apos;s why you were gonna do it for him .
that was you outside the irish bar , wasn &apos;t it ?
yes .
yes , it was me . it was all me .
where is he ? where &apos;s ben ?
this is all my fault .
i should never have told him .
but he kept asking me questions about his father ,
and i thought he was old enough to know the truth .
how do you tell a child
his father is a rapist ?
please .
it wasn &apos;t him .
he didn &apos;t do it .
i did . just ...
he &apos;s on his way to a better life .
he &apos;s going to college .
where is he , kathleen ?
he &apos;s gone .
i took him to the airport this morning .
what do you want to bet ben didn &apos;t get on that plane ?
greetings , fair citizens ,
and welcome to our monthly town hall meeting .
as you know , the colonists were angry
about the writs of assistance ,
which they argued violated natural rights
described by john locke during the enlightenment .
do you have a question , young lad ?
yes . what about my mother &apos;s rights ?
she was your student ...
and you raped her !
hey , ben ?
hey . put it down . all right ?
come on . don &apos;t do this . think about your mother .
hasn &apos;t she suffered enough ?
get away from me !
wait a minute .
listen to me , okay ? i can help you .
all right ? i can talk to the da .
i can tell him it was an accident .
you didn &apos;t mean to hurt those people .
it won &apos;t make a difference .
it will .
it will , ben .
okay ? the truth will come out .
let this man live with what he did
for the rest of his life .
no ! no ! please !
please let me shoot him !
you don &apos;t understand what he did to my mother .
all right , ben .
no . no .
you cannot believe how healthy starsky is .
yeah , didn &apos;t you find he had more turquoise feathers
after he recovered ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
gas ... pains .
really ?
wow . my mother &apos;s here .
i thought she was in paris .
she forgot to say goodbye .
may i join you ?
mother .
what a lovely surprise .
hello , darling .
i couldn &apos;t go without seeing you one more time .
sit .
um , here ...
oh , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not that fussy .
here .
strange . wonder where maura gets it .
you like greasy hamburgers ?
actually , i &apos;d love a hamburger . it &apos;s been years .
oh , good , &apos; cause this place has some really good ones
after the health department shut it down .
the health department ?
mom , it &apos;s a joke .
she likes to kid .
milkshake .
i haven &apos;t had one for ages .
oh , god , i love them .
really ? i @-@ i didn &apos;t know that .
no ?
i @-@ i would like one . strawberry .
since when do you like milkshakes ?
since now .
all right . i &apos;m having a beer .
a beer milkshake ?
yes . uh , yes .
a beer milkshake .
it &apos;s what all the mooks here in boston drink .
okay . she &apos;s kidding . she &apos;s kidding .
it &apos;s another joke .
well , i can certainly see the family resemblance .
well , i can see the family resemblance , too .
you do ?
yes , the two of you are so much alike .
what is it ?
what is it ?
nothing .
nothing .
you want a peanut ?
they &apos;re really good .
thank you .
