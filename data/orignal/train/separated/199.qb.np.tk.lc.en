gossip gril here ,
you &apos;re one of the resources
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
dad , i am so sorry . i wanted to tell you .
tell me what ?
this is milo humphrey , your grandson .
a body washed up in paris--shot .
the identification they found says it &apos;s charles bass .
what &apos;s your name ?
henry .
welcome to paris , henry .
let &apos;s go home .
i think i need to be alone for a while .
oh , so i didn &apos;t realize you and serena were actually over .
i &apos;m not gonna spend the entire summer
waiting for her to figure things out .
could i at least get your number ?
what , it &apos;s not in your friend &apos;s little black book ?
when you &apos;re ready to talk about
what really got you into this place , give me a call .
you know what ? you were right . i ... i was hurt .
do you wanna meet up to grab a cup of coffee ?
that sounds great , yeah .
i thought that someone who loved what i love
could one day love me , too , but i guess not .
no , no , no .
i &apos;ve been acting like i &apos;m okay , but i &apos;m not .
what if i never get over chuck ?
summer is coming to a close , and as everyone knows ,
paris , like the upper east side ,
empties out in august ,
leaving behind only the tourists and the dreamers ,
lamenting the imminent return to real life .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s almost time to go back to new york already .
i know , and you still
haven &apos;t made your sophie &apos;s choice
between brooklyn and the upper east side .
what ? if you go back with an uncertain heart ,
there will be drama and disaster for all .
it &apos;s like choosing between eclairs and napoleons .
they &apos;re both delicious .
except humphrey &apos;s a doughnut .
well , i would love to stay and talk patisserie ,
but i have to get ready for my perfect parisian date .
wait , what ? you got louis to give you a second chance ?
b. , that &apos;s great .
and to prove that i care about more than his title ,
i &apos;ve planned a day
of polite interaction with the proletariat .
think diana , princess of the people .
obviously , i &apos;ll wear gloves .
obviously .
well , i &apos;m off to buy gently worn items in the 12th .
and don &apos;t worry .
not even you choosing a humphrey will ruin my date .
nothing will .
au revoir .
hi , mom .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you
on your last day , serena .
i got a very upsetting phone call from the paris police .
oh , if it &apos;s about blair pushing me in the fountain ,
i &apos;m not pressing charges .
they pulled a body out of the river
and found charles &apos; wallet .
oh , my god . you don &apos;t think it &apos;s him , do you ?
well , it would be a lot easier not to panic
if someone had heard from him
or he had been paying the empire bills .
listen , um , sweetheart ,
they need a family member to identify the body .
if it &apos;s too much for you , i will be on the next flight .
no , no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m here . i can do it .
thank you .
listen , let &apos;s just keep this between us .
i don &apos;t want to worry anyone
until we know for sure what &apos;s really going on .
yean , i agree .
i &apos;m sorry for the 7 @-@ hour @-@ long story .
are you kidding ?
serena took her best friend &apos;s boyfriend &apos;s virginity ,
ran away to boarding school ,
bounced from guy to guy
until dating your married congressman cousin ,
fell in love with you ,
and then cheated on you with your friend ,
who &apos;s also her ex ?
yep .
the only thing that would make it better
is if one of those boyfriends turned out to be her brother .
well , does stepbrother count ?
the life of serena van der woodsen
is like the most complicated jane austen novel ever .
aren &apos;t you glad you finally reached the last chapter ?
i haven &apos;t even responded yet .
things between us-- they never really ended .
they just ... stopped , and ...
instead of dealing with them , i @-@ i just ...
you little @-@ black @-@ booked the pain away ?
exactly .
well , do you wanna get back together with her ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , it would be nice if i were the one deciding , not her .
in that case , the first thing you need to do
is eliminate the competition . what was his name again ?
dan &apos;s not the competition , all right . he &apos;s my friend .
besides , for all i know ,
he &apos;s not even interested in her anymore .
and what happens if it &apos;s too late by the time you find out ?
look ...
i can help .
let me ... be your life coach
for the next 24 hours ,
and i promise you , you will be in a place
where you &apos;re the one making the choice .
brooklyn , you say ?
why don &apos;t we just both go home , shower , get dressed ,
and i &apos;ll meet you there ?
sounds good .
good .
the body
was in no condition for fingerprints ,
but ...
we found this .
that &apos;s his .
we &apos;re testing the blood on the wallet .
do you need a moment
to gather yourself ?
no amount of time will ever make this okay .
five more minutes .
as pleasurable as those 300 seconds sound ,
your uncle was already generous enough
to help the strange american
you brought home from prague .
i don &apos;t want to be late for my first day on the job .
one thing i &apos;ll miss about taking care of you after the shooting
will be spending all day in bed together .
i couldn &apos;t have enjoyed being saved more .
i &apos;m just happy to be taking care of you now .
i know a way you could take care of me right now .
i wouldn &apos;t be able to tear myself away .
then what would your uncle think ?
you &apos;re a good man , henry prince .
too good .
this loft is your loft
this loft is my loft
where &apos;s your aunt jenny
she moved to hudson
she wears ... leggings
wow . i did not need to see or hear that .
no . well , i &apos;m--i &apos;m doing the best i can .
who &apos;s this ?
this is juliet sharp . she &apos;s a new friend .
pleasure to meet you , dan .
i hope you don &apos;t mind me tagging along .
no , no . vanessa &apos;s supposed to be here already ,
and georgina &apos;s at the spa ,
and milo has not been taking his bottle all morning .
oh , buddy . i think he &apos;s kind of mad at me .
you all right ?
yeah , you wanna hold him , nate ?
you don &apos;t expect me to sing , do you ?
no . just make sure you prop his neck up .
oh , he smells funny .
oh , maybe he just needs a woman &apos;s voice .
okay .
whatever you were singing was definitely not that . hmm ?
ask him , like we agreed .
come here . yeah . you &apos;re so cute .
she &apos;s definitely not out of chuck &apos;s little black book .
no . no , she , uh , sure isn &apos;t .
so ... have you heard from serena lately ?
uh , no . no , i haven &apos;t .
i would assume she &apos;s still in paris or at brown already .
actually , gossip girl said she &apos;s going to columbia .
she &apos;s--she &apos;s coming back to the city for school now ?
that &apos;s what the blast said . you not okay with that ?
no . no , i &apos;m fine with it ... i guess .
i @-@ i &apos;m just surprised she didn &apos;t say anything to me about it .
but if she didn &apos;t say anything to you ...
hey , dan , can you grab a diaper ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;ll do it .
what is it ?
well , he said he hadn &apos;t heard from her .
looks like dan &apos;s playing a game with you .
now do you want to win ,
or do you want to lose ?
i suppose it &apos;s worth missing you
if it means staying in a place
where you don &apos;t have nightmares .
and you look very handsome in your work clothes .
well , i look forward to you removing them
after an honest day &apos;s work .
bye .
bye .
they say it &apos;s easy to forget your troubles
when the weather &apos;s warm .
but all it takes is one fall breeze
to blow reality right back in your face .
what are you doing ?
suddenly we &apos;re stopping for pedestrians ? vite !
watch out , blair .
he who sows the wind reaps the storm .
next time , i promise we &apos;ll do shoes and vintage ,
and not just health food stores .
aw . let me see that beautiful boy .
well , you guys seem to have bonded .
we had a nice talk .
aw , vanessa , you &apos;re amazing with him .
yeah , she &apos;s a serious baby whisperer .
living on a commune , you clock a lot of babysitting hours .
right ?
okay , i get what you &apos;re doing ,
and it &apos;s not exactly subtle .
the goal is to take him out of the equation .
not by using vanessa .
she &apos;s still totally in love with him .
she &apos;s just hurt by what happened last spring ,
and she &apos;s looking for a sign
to see how he really feels about her .
she told you that ?
she didn &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m not trying to ruin people &apos;s lives .
vanessa and dan are great people .
and from what i hear , they made a great couple , too .
yeah . okay , i will .
i love you , too . bye .
&quot; i love you , nate &quot; or &quot; i love you , dan &quot; ?
&quot; i love you , mom . &quot;
oh . well , it &apos;s all right . now that i &apos;m an egalitarian ,
i &apos;ll accept it even if you choose dan ,
and not just because he &apos;s ahead in the &quot; gossip girl &quot; poll .
gossip girl has a poll ?
honestly , i haven &apos;t even thought about it .
b. , i went to the morgue today .
what is that ? a sex club ?
a place where they keep dead bodies .
i had to identify one because he had chuck &apos;s i.d.
don &apos;t worry . it wasn &apos;t him .
i &apos;m not worried .
but , blair , i just hung up with my mom ,
and chuck is missing .
well , consider him found .
he was on the rue de charenton an hour ago .
what , you saw him ? here ?
gossip girl said i was in paris . where else would he be ?
my mom and the police are looking everywhere .
he hasn &apos;t paid an empire bill all summer .
his assets are about to be frozen .
i could care less about his bassets .
and besides , he &apos;s probably filtering his finances
through some foreign government
so that i won &apos;t know he &apos;s stalking me .
well , what did he say when you saw him ?
nothing .
he limped away , and i kept driving .
that doesn &apos;t sound very stalker @-@ ish .
it &apos;s chuck . it &apos;s probably part of some elaborate scheme .
well , he did have blood on his wallet ,
and you said you saw him limping .
don &apos;t you think we should at least make sure he &apos;s okay ?
i &apos;m sorry he pissed off the wrong pickpocket .
but i &apos;ve been waiting for this date all summer .
i &apos;m not gonna let him ruin it .
i &apos;m sure louis would understand
if you &apos;re a little late .
i can &apos;t talk to him , s.
you don &apos;t know what it was like ,
seeing him , even through the car window .
trust me , the only thing wrong with chuck
is that i &apos;m gonna be happy without him .
your oysters , henry . here .
i thought you might be ready for a break .
i have to ask .
your first day made me believe not all american are lazy .
i see you tomorrow . enjoy paris .
merci .
merci . voil ? monsieur .
what is wrong ? are you mad at me ?
no , you &apos;re perfect .
i was just thinking maybe
this isn &apos;t the right place for us after all .
why ? was working with oncle alphonse so horrible ?
it &apos;s not the job . it &apos;s paris .
but you loved it this morning .
and you slept through the night for the first time in weeks .
true , but i credit you with all of that .
i mean , we could live anywhere and be happy .
i hear india is amazing .
for francais and salma , maybe .
but we can barely afford the bus to lorraine .
i may have a way to figure out the finances .
well , that was an interesting call .
was that paris ? news about chuck ?
that was dr. feiner from lenox hill .
unfortunately , he cannot discuss milo &apos;s medical records
with anyone other than his parents .
i was just hoping to get some more information ,
make sure this guy &apos;s even a real doctor ,
not some sex phone operator
that crazy girl paid off to lie to us .
oh , now who &apos;s crazy ?
georgina went for a spa weekend
right after dan signed the birth certificate .
we need to get our own paternity test done while she &apos;s gone .
well , she said we could .
it &apos;s not like we have to sneak around behind her back .
now whatever you might believe ,
your son is in brooklyn ,
struggling to take care of a baby .
so you can sit here and brood all by yourself ,
or you can come with me
and help me turn jenny &apos;s room into a nursery
so that child has a proper place to sleep .
you know where i &apos;ll be if you change your mind .
have you ever seen anyone sleep so deeply ?
i know you said things were complicated ,
but you and dan really seem to click .
we do ...
or did ,
before the thing with serena .
you have to tell her .
dan made nate promise not to tell you , so ...
you can &apos;t say anything , but he does have feelings for you .
he told us himself .
really ?
you should go for it , yeah .
my friend saw him around here this morning .
he has an intimate relationship with alcohol ,
so i figured i &apos;d check all the bars first .
he doesn &apos;t drink here ,
but he looks very much like my new waiter .
is he american , from new york ?
all i know is he came to paris from ,
uh , prague with my niece .
well , if he &apos;s who i think he is , he could be in a lot of trouble .
i @-@ i need to talk to him .
he doesn &apos;t do much talking , especially about himself .
please , sir ,
i &apos;ve been to every bar in the neighborhood .
and he &apos;s my stepbrother , and i &apos;m very worried about him .
if you have any idea where he is , please ...
tell me you didn &apos;t rob a bank .
my grandfather left me a small inheritance .
i &apos;ve just been waiting for the right thing to spend it on .
but it doesn &apos;t look small to me .
it &apos;s enough to get us to london , then kerala .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
i &apos;ve never been more sure of anything .
is it hot or cold in kerala ?
do we need shots ?
and what do i pack ?
chuck , it &apos;s you .
who &apos;s here ?
oh , hi . i &apos;m serena van der woodsen .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really sorry to show up like this .
i &apos;ve just been looking for chuck everywhere .
henry , what is she talking about ?
i don &apos;t know . the man you &apos;re looking for is not here .
holy bruce wayne , batman .
it &apos;s one thing to hide who you really are .
it &apos;s another to pretend you don &apos;t exist .
i had no idea
you had such deep appreciation for street food .
i &apos;m quite surprised
that your favorite restaurant is on rue de la huchette .
yes , well , the masterpieces of the louvre don &apos;t compare
to the simple pleasures of the kebab .
paris is complicated
and beautiful ...
much like you .
but you know what &apos;s even better than street food ?
street artists .
i heard there &apos;s an amazing bucket drummer
at the pont neuf metro station . should we investigate ?
well , i was thinking
more of a chauffeured drive in the country ,
to the ball my parents are throwing for the givenchy exhibition .
oh ! givenchy was audrey &apos;s favorite .
does that mean you-- you &apos;ll allow me to escort you
to cheau de harou ?
nothing would make me happier ,
except maybe saving this for later .
where &apos;s milo ?
i gave him a bottle and
put him down in your bedroom .
you know , he should really have a nursery .
yeah , i know . i &apos;ve been meaning to get to that .
you hungry ?
always . i can &apos;t remember the last time that
i ate something that didn &apos;t come out of a ... a box .
did you do all this ?
i thought you deserved a bottle , too .
you &apos;ve been under so much pressure , i can &apos;t even imagine .
i really missed you .
i missed you , too .
i know that i @-@ i @-@ i haven &apos;t gotten a full night &apos;s sleep in a while .
i don &apos;t really know what i &apos;m saying half the time .
but i &apos;m so grateful that you &apos;ve been here helping me .
and after everything that--that , you know , i put your through ,
which i haven &apos;t even apologized for ,
i haven &apos;t explained it .
stop talking .
you know i &apos;m not good at that .
i think i can help .
i had a feeling you &apos;d linger .
i &apos;m not gonna leave .
chuck , today i had to identify a body
that the police thought was you .
did you do something to that man ?
if--if it was self @-@ defense ,
i &apos;m sure that they would understand .
i never touched that thief .
so is blair right ? is this another one of your games ?
do i look like i &apos;m playing ?
i know more than anyone
what it &apos;s like to want to reinvent yourself .
but just because people are mad at you
doesn &apos;t mean you should disappear .
my mom is really worried about you .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll come to celebrate my absence ,
as will all the people
who &apos;ve wished me dead since the day i was born .
i know things were bad in new york .
but if you don &apos;t come home , you &apos;ll lose the empire .
you &apos;ll lose everything you ever cared about .
i already lost the only thing i cared about .
they can have everything else .
i don &apos;t know what you told that girl ,
but you can &apos;t turn your back on who you really are .
i &apos;m going to see an old associate ,
picking up a passport with my new name on it .
after today , there is no chuck bass .
i &apos;m staying at eleanor and cyrus&apos;
when you realize that &apos;s not true .
wow . that was , uh ...
yeah .
i &apos;ll have to thank nate the next time i see him .
nate ? i &apos;m sorry , but , i mean ,
i don &apos;t mean to be a credit hog , but that was all me .
no , i mean , i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m glad that he told me .
told you what ?
the truth .
wh--about what ?
okay , after i told nate that i was nervous
about you still being in love with serena ,
he said that it wasn &apos;t true
and that you told him you still had feelings for me .
and there it is .
i @-@ i &apos;ll go .
okay .
perhaps it should be tilted more .
oh , wow . a coronation already ? the date must &apos;ve gone well .
oh , s. , we walked , we talked , we laughed .
i &apos;d forgotten what it was like to just have fun with a guy .
and now i &apos;m off to meet his parents at a ball .
just look at all the gowns he sent !
the fairy tale is back on
as long as the evil queen doesn &apos;t ruin it .
well , if you &apos;re talking about chuck , don &apos;t worry .
the only person he wants to poison is himself .
you talked to chuck ? no . i don &apos;t care .
i don &apos;t even wanna know what he said .
i &apos;ve been waiting all summer to feel sparkly again ,
and i won &apos;t be pulled back into the darkness .
you &apos;re right .
go live your fairy tale . don &apos;t worry about chuck .
if that is didier ludot ,
tell them they should &apos;ve been more prompt !
now , you ... this is all wrong .
i can &apos;t believe your people invented the coiffure .
yes . that &apos;s more like it .
i can &apos;t even see myself !
claire von rohr .
gorgeous blonde .
princeton .
oh , and look . her family has a house by ours in trancoso .
okay , yeah , she sounds great , but i @-@ i don &apos;t get it .
what are you saying ?
you &apos;re gonna go on a date with her .
well , i thought the whole point was to be available .
the point was for dan not to be .
you have to have somebody fabulous on your arm
so serena doesn &apos;t think
that you spent the whole summer pining for her .
here , let me call--
okay , listen , i appreciate the gesture ,
but you don &apos;t know serena van der woodsen .
not just any hot girl is gonna spark her jealousy .
so what are you saying ? you have a better option ?
louis , merci pour tout ...
no .
i can &apos;t do any more of these prince and pauper games .
i &apos;m sorry , madame .
monsieur simply asked me to escort you
for one final touch before the gala .
would you like to come with me to harry winston ?
would i ?
is there some business you need to attend to before we go ?
nothing i have any interest in .
escort away .
blair , call me back .
remember when i told you not to worry about chuck ?
well , i was wrong .
spotted--one american leaving paris .
au revoir , l &apos;enfant terrible .
b. , you know i wouldn &apos;t bother you if it wasn &apos;t serious .
i need your help .
finally .
inspector chevalier , of course .
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
it &apos;s beautiful .
i mean , of course , they all are .
monsieur grimaldi would want me to be sure it was perfect .
like that .
carats , clarity , charisma .
not that i expect louis to get me a ring so soon , but ...
this is the most beautiful thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
i am sorry . this ring has already been sold .
shouldn &apos;t you be out dealing with your own issues
instead of hunting me down ?
i didn &apos;t even know you were here . why are you here ?
why are you ?
i see that you have found monsieur bass &apos; stolen property .
mr. bass &apos; property ?
the ring is his ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
inspector chevalier asked me to claim it .
the thieves couldn &apos;t pawn such a valuable piece
at their usual haunts in prague ,
so they came to paris
to try to return it for the cash .
harry winston knew monsieur bass was the original purchaser .
that &apos;s when they called us .
and the body you saw was one of the thieves .
so why was chuck &apos;s blood on the wallet ?
monsieur bass would not let go of the ring .
he fought them hard , so they shot him .
chuck was shot ?
let me explain ...
what the hell , man ?
you told vanessa i had feelings for her ?
i just thought you two were connecting .
why are we whispering ? is she still here ?
yeah , she &apos;s--yeah , just-- just keep whispering .
okay . look , you guys spent all day together ,
just the two of you .
so ? just because things were great
doesn &apos;t give you the right to lie to her about me .
was it a lie ?
this is about serena . it is , isn &apos;t it ?
okay , i wouldn &apos;t have said anything to vanessa
if you hadn &apos;t lied about getting that text .
what text ?
when &apos;s the last time you checked your phone ?
obviously not as recently as you did .
oh , man .
yeah , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s from serena .
i thought you saw it .
i got the same one .
same one what ?
uh , it--it &apos;s a text from serena .
yeah .
so she &apos;s interested in both of you ?
yeah , that &apos;s kind of what it seems like .
yeah , or she &apos;s interested in one of us ,
and just wants to , like , let the other one down easy maybe .
oh . is that why you told me dan had feelings ?
yeah . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry , vanessa .
oh , my god .
how stupid can i be
to think you &apos;d actually put serena behind you ?
vanessa , i &apos;m ...
surprise !
it &apos;s time for an extreme nursery makeover .
you know that ring was meant for you .
he was gonna propose to you
on top of the empire state building .
i can &apos;t care about that .
it doesn &apos;t change what he did instead--jenny humphrey .
b. , i know how much he hurt you .
he knows how much he hurt you .
that &apos;s why he signed over the empire
and everything he owns to my mom .
well , hopefully she can run it
without entering the human flesh trade .
blair , he &apos;s changing his name .
his landlady said he &apos;s on his way to the train station .
this is chuck we &apos;re talking about .
he really could just disappear .
if you &apos;re so torn up about it , stop him .
you and i both know you &apos;re the only one that can do that .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have a ball to attend .
blair .
blair , he almost died
holding onto that ring
and to the hope of you .
i forgave him for something
that no one else in the world would ever get over .
then he turned around
and did the one thing he knew i could never let go .
but you don &apos;t need to forgive him .
you don &apos;t even need to talk to him again after today .
but i know you , and you will always regret it
if you do nothing and just let him disappear .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know .
the truth is , i don &apos;t even know how i feel about serena .
i just ... i want a clear shot at finding out without--
i--you don &apos;t have to say it .
yeah .
how do you feel about her ?
i was in the middle of trying to figure that out
when i was interrupted by the arrival of georgina &apos;s swollen belly .
it was kinda--kinda hard to focus after that .
i &apos;ll take your word for it .
you know , and being with vanessa--
even if it is thanks to your meddling--felt good .
and all of our problems from last year--tisch , whatever--
they just feel really , really small now .
too bad she hates you .
yeah , maybe .
or maybe it &apos;s for the best . i don &apos;t know .
anyway , serena gets back tomorrow .
what are we gonna do ?
i knew it was too good to be true .
who is she ?
just because you &apos;re dressed poorly
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re not chuck bass .
why would i want to be him ?
you should &apos;ve told me you got shot .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t shoot me yourself .
i have , many times , in my dreams .
the good ones .
but if you were really hurt , i would want to know .
when i woke up , my i.d. was gone .
nobody knew who i was .
nobody was coming to look for me .
i realized i might be alive ,
but chuck bass didn &apos;t have to be .
changing your name doesn &apos;t change who you are .
it &apos;s a good start ,
a chance to live simply , earn people &apos;s respect ,
maybe become a person someone could love .
someone did love you .
and ...
you owe it to her
and everyone else you &apos;re leaving behind
not to run away , which is what you &apos;re doing .
and i don &apos;t think that great man
you &apos;re talking about wanting to be
is a coward .
i think he would face up to what he did .
i destroyed the only thing i ever loved .
i don &apos;t love you anymore .
but it takes more than even you
to destroy blair waldorf .
your world would be easier if i didn &apos;t come back .
that &apos;s true .
but it wouldn &apos;t be my world without you in it .
it doesn &apos;t feel right to be in new york without you .
did the plane ride back to reality
land you on either nate or dan ?
not exactly .
how could you spend seven hours on a plane
with a library of romantic comedies and not find clarity ?
trust me , i tried .
i even made a list of pros and cons .
dan--good shoulder to cry on .
nate--good shoulders .
well , as long as you promise
that gossip girl won &apos;t find out before i do .
i have a poll to win .
i promise . how are you ?
well , i ate too many meringues at lunch ,
but talking to chuck made me realize what i want , too .
good . well , i hope you get it then .
merci , mon amie .
thank you for calling me . and you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
it was wrong for me to interfere .
well , what was wrong was for me
to hand over control of my life
to a beautiful girl i just met in a restaurant .
seriously , what was up with that ?
i &apos;m kidding .
blame all here . no more life coach .
friends ?
friends .
i &apos;d like to apologize to dan as well .
i know this might actually sound weird ,
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m glad that yesterday happened .
why ?
because after your publicly broadcast pajama party
with serena , you thought i needed more humiliation ?
no . no . because last night when i read on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
that serena had boarded a plane home ,
i didn &apos;t care .
all i could think about was making things right with you .
now whatever &apos;s happened in the past .
right here , right now .
i wanna be with you .
i hope your calling me means your business is complete .
it is .
i &apos;m sorry i distracted you from your parents &apos; ball .
in paris , there &apos;s always another ball .
the sarkozys are saluting jerry lewis tomorrow night ,
if you &apos;re not otherwise engaged .
there &apos;s nothing i &apos;d rather do than salute jerry lewis .
but ...
i can &apos;t live in this fairy tale .
i promise this is not a story for little girls .
but ...
i &apos;ve been using it
to run away from my real life on the upper east side .
someone there did something for me that i have to honor .
will i ever see you again ?
you can always come find me .
it &apos;s vivier .
it &apos;s worth a hell of a lot more than a glass slipper .
look , milo , you have a nursery . isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
it is . he &apos;s a lucky boy .
rufus !
is this the david netto crib that i ordered ?
oh , it &apos;s dan and jenny &apos;s .
i got it out of storage .
i wouldn &apos;t want my grandson sleeping in anything else .
i couldn &apos;t agree with you more . what changed your mind ?
you .
i &apos;ll never be sure
if georgina &apos;s telling me the whole truth ,
but dan is my son , and i &apos;m not gonna bail on him .
and if i &apos;m wrong ,
how much time have i lost with this little guy
&apos;cause i let my suspicions get the better of me ?
aw . here . i &apos;m gonna go cancel the other crib .
would you take him ?
okay . sure . hello , buddy .
thank you .
milo , i think you have the humphrey jaw .
mom ! hey !
serena . hi !
oh ! darling , what are you doing here ?
laryssa told me where you were .
i came straight from the airport .
well , we have a surprise for you .
great , but first , i wanna find dan and nate .
okay .
find me ? i &apos;m right here .
dan ! and vanessa .
hey , serena .
nate .
juliet .
hi .
hi . nice to meet you .
hey , serena .
rufus and ... baby ?
this is milo . he &apos;s my son .
son ?
you saw me four months ago .
if you thought i was pregnant ,
then i &apos;m offended .
okay , is someone gonna help fill me in ?
not it .
yeah , i @-@ i @-@ i will explain everything .
just , uh , just sit down . i gotta get him a bottle .
uh , i &apos;ll get it .
with dan spotted kissing vanessa
and nate &apos;s early morning coffees with a new blonde ,
it looks like the oddsmakers have taken a beating .
serena van der woodsen
will be walking onto columbia &apos;s campus single .
this poll is now closed ,
and nobody won .
did you choose ?
they choose first .
so when i grabbed your hand back there , you seemed to like it .
was that just a part of the act ,
or do i actually have a shot at a date ?
you &apos;ve been over serena for , like , seven minutes .
you &apos;re not ready for me yet .
and when i am ?
you know how to find me .
just as every summer ends ,
all tourists come home , all dreamers wake up ,
and new problems are born .
what &apos;s all this ?
oh , it was laying around the nursery .
i thought i &apos;d put it into a baby book for dan .
that &apos;s a good idea . oh , is this milo &apos;s hospital bracelet ?
yeah . look how tiny his wrist was .
huh . either this is a mistake or ...
or what ?
milo &apos;s bracelet says his blood type is o @-@ negative .
that &apos;s a universal donor . that &apos;s not common .
rufus , enough conspiracy theories .
look , the closest you &apos;ve been to medical school
is having a lincoln hawk song licensed for &quot; chicago hope . &quot;
when dan got his appendix out as a kid ,
i banked some blood just in case something went wrong .
he &apos;s a.b.-positive , same as me .
okay , so georgina is type o .
i &apos;m sure she is . likely , so is milo &apos;s real father .
and just like that ,
a pretty girl &apos;s ugly secret is revealed .
i had to improvise , but it &apos;s done .
i &apos;ll see you soon , and we &apos;ll talk about what &apos;s next .
take care . hang in there .
i miss you .
when you didn &apos;t come home last night ,
i assumed you &apos;d left with that girl .
i owe you an apology .
i don &apos;t expect you to understand , but where i &apos;m from ,
people lie and cheat and destroy whoever gets in their way .
i did it better than any of them .
when you dragged me in from the alley ,
you didn &apos;t just save my life .
you gave me the hope of a new one .
well , the you i &apos;ve been living with
never did anything to be ashamed of .
i hope ...
i hope you &apos;ll bring some of him with you back to your world .
i fully intend to ...
if you &apos;ll come with me .
to new york ?
you got me a ticket ?
we don &apos;t need tickets .
i &apos;m chuck bass .
but no matter what the new season brings ,
we &apos;ll always have paris .
