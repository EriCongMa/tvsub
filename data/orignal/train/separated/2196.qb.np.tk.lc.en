so i think we &apos;re done .
i could arrest you
for ignoring a direct order . how about that ?
you could .
but you won &apos;t .
you remember that time i snuck out to maunawili falls
because you and all your friends were there ?
you guys were all jumping off that cliff .
i climbed all the way to the top ,
&apos;cause i wanted to jump , too .
big shot 12 @-@ year @-@ old .
all your friends were cheering me on .
but you didn &apos;t want me to jump .
and when i did ,
you didn &apos;t talk to me for a whole month .
because if something bad would &apos;ve happened to you ,
uncle would &apos;ve put me in the ground .
my point is i was fine then .
and i &apos;ll be fine now .
that just proves how stubborn you are .
runs in the family .
i can &apos;t argue with that .
requesting permission to come aboard .
permission granted , commander .

but you &apos;re gonna give it to her for free ?
who said anything about free ?
i was gonna have her wear my designer apparel .
little product placement for the journey .
kono , take it . it &apos;s good .
in case your sail fails , you got an extra .

thank you .
dad ?
i didn &apos;t think you were coming .

malama pono .
his name is brian devlin .
he &apos;s been the head pharmacist here for 12 years .
he has a wife and two kids .
all right , what else do we know ?
this is the fourth drugstore robbery in three days .
first one to leave a vic .
witnesses said that
three masked gunmen entered the store .
opened fire on mr. devlin when he tried
to activate the silent alarm .
how much did they make off with ?
they weren &apos;t here for money .
otc pseudoephedrine .
one box of this yields roughly
three grams of meth . right ?
these guys are working with stock
from four different pharmacies .
these ain &apos;t some kids just goofing around
trying to cook meth in their father &apos;s garage .
we &apos;re dealing with some major players here .
all right , listen .
if we don &apos;t find them soon ,
a bunch of new product is gonna flood the market .
i want them for this murder .
chin ?

kono said she was going around the storm .
she &apos;ll be fine .
yeah .
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
all right .
- 夏威夷谚语
any updates ?
yeah .
so i simulated kono &apos;s movement
based on wind speed and currents .
it seems likely she beat the storm .
but , you know ... i can &apos;t be sure .
you can &apos;t be sure ,
but watching this all night &apos;s not gonna help .
i tried calling her satellite phone .
she didn &apos;t pick up .
right , but she said , before she left ,
she was gonna save the battery .
remember ? turn it on every other day ,
check in with us ?
now , it &apos;s day one .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s on track .
she knows what she &apos;s doing . she &apos;s fine .
hey . hpd just sent over
that footage from the pharmacy takedown .
come on .
now , these two birds are just the muscle .
this guy &apos;s the cook .
knows exactly what he &apos;s looking for .
wait , lou . pause it right there .
what , you recognize that ink ?
yeah .
that &apos;s makai akana .
he used to be the most prolific cook on the island .
he had a reputation for pumping out high @-@ grade meth
in a very short amount of time .
yeah , i put him in halawa years ago .
looks like he made parole a week ago .

look , whatever my father did this time ,
i don &apos;t know anything about it
and i don &apos;t want to know .
clear !
all right .
he &apos;s not here , it &apos;s clear .
you have any idea where we can find him ?
he dropped by a few days ago , after he got out .
i haven &apos;t heard from him since .
what happened when he came by ?
he wanted to talk ,
but to tell you the truth ,
i wasn &apos;t in a listening mood .
all right . your old man got a cell phone ?
i have no idea .
if i give this to you , carter ,
can i count on you to call me if you hear from him ?
if it means never seeing him again ,
absolutely .
pretty sure you &apos;re not gonna make
that kid &apos;s christmas card list .
can &apos;t say that i blame him .
that kid grew up without a mother .
dad in and out of the joint .
you know , when i arrested makai ten years ago ,
carter there was a straight @-@ a student in high school .
he was heading toward hsu .
that day changed his life .
they put him in the foster system
and nothing was the same after that .
hands in the water , kono .
eyes ahead .
ankles together .

mom ! i &apos;m flying !
that &apos;s it , kono ! keep going !

i &apos;m flying .
getting a strong cell signal , three o &apos;clock .
fall back ! cover me !
clear !
stop what you &apos;re doing .
get on your knees , put your hands behind your head .
i can &apos;t do that .
it doesn &apos;t look like you have much choice .
you don &apos;t understand .
i can &apos;t stop .
if i don &apos;t finish ,
my son is dead .
- 夏威夷谚语
it &apos;s working !
mom , it &apos;s working !
remember , kono ,
the earth provides sustenance for the sea
so the sea can provide for us .
who are they ?
i don &apos;t know their names .
you don &apos;t know their names ?
why , you three have hit a lot of pharmacies
in the last three days .
you expect us to believe
you don &apos;t know who your partners are ?
they weren &apos;t my &quot; partners . &quot;
i was their prisoner .
that &apos;s right .
i already told you .
i had to cook . i had no choice .
why don &apos;t you just back up ?
take it from the top .
last week , i get out of halawa .
i &apos;m barely out the door when these guys jump me .
they tell me if i don &apos;t cook for them ,
they &apos;ll kill carter .
these two in the photo ?
and their boss .
we want to believe you , makai ,
but , right now , we got a dead pharmacist in the morgue
and you did absolutely nothing
to prevent him from being there .
my son is all i have .
all right , i get that .
but help us make sense of all this .
tell us about your boss .
i can &apos;t .
forget this .
i &apos;m done .
those two words just put you back in jail .
okay .
but you have to promise you &apos;ll protect my boy .
we will put a security detail on him
once you give us a name .
willie moon .
willie moon .
24 years old .
his accomplishments include dropping out of high school at 16,
and holding a string of dead @-@ end jobs .
no criminal record to speak of .
i find it hard to believe
that this kid is the brains behind the next major
up @-@ and @-@ coming meth production and distribution ring .
he have any connection to makai ?
none .
all right , then why does he pick makai ?
the guy &apos;s been in jail for years .
there are plenty of cooks on the island .
everybody starts somewhere .
how do we know we &apos;re not witnessing the birth of a major player ?
all right , well , here &apos;s the thing :
if moon is the real deal ,
the good news is we &apos;ve got a chance to crack this kid
before he makes his mark on the ice trade .
find them .
you done ?
i &apos;ll be back tomorrow .
kila ?
paoa ?
willie moon ,
you &apos;re under arrest for murder ,
methamphetamine trafficking
and about half a dozen other related charges .
get on your knees , put your hands behind your head .
did you find moon ?
we did .
turns out he wasn &apos;t the one that put you back in the kitchen .
well , who @-@ whose idea was it ?
no matter what he did ,
he was still your father .
did he say why ?
he said you owed him .
that when you went to prison ,
you left him with nothing .
what about the other guys ?
they were carter &apos;s friends .
my son made up this threat to force me to cook again ?
he called it his inheritance .
that , as far as he was concerned ,
you were dead to him .
so ,
what happens now ?
your son &apos;s gonna go to prison .
you &apos;re gonna walk away from this
with your parole intact , no more prison time .
doesn &apos;t really matter .
when i was in halawa ,
there was only one reason to get out .
carter .
that ...
second chance kept me going .
and now ...
i &apos;ve got nothing .
makai ,
i know what it &apos;s like to have your family
turn their back on you .
let me give you a little bit of advice .
keep moving forward ,
because you still have a shot at redemption .
if not for your son ,
then for yourself .
i &apos;ll get you out of here .
over here !
hey ! over here !
come back ! come back ...
