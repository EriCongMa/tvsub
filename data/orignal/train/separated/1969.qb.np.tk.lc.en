i love you .
i love everything about you .
i get to change lives ! that &apos;s the dream !
fine , i don &apos;t want to go to africa .
i found out that i &apos;m pregnant with mark &apos;s baby .
are you in or are you out ?
i &apos;m in .
oh , my god !
callie ! callie !
i choose you to be the one with whom i spend my life .
i can &apos;t keep doing this alone , arizona .
i thought we were past the hard stuff .
we have a child !
i know !
how could you do this ? i don &apos;t want to fix us anymore .
this is penny .
callie &apos;s moving to new york .
and she &apos;s trying to take sofia with her .
you hired a lawyer .
you started this .
there &apos;s this bible story .
two women both claim to be the mother of the same child .
my client is prepared to offer scheduled visitation
every other weekend .
king solomon had to choose .
that is ridiculous , and she knows it .
sofia cannot take a six @-@ hour flight by herself twice a month .
that would be a hard no .
hold , please .
two mothers . only one gets the kid .
we knew they &apos;d shoot that down .
they are shooting everything down
because they &apos;re being unreasonable .
they have the luxury of being unreasonable right now .
we have less than 12 hours to try to settle .
their witness lineup is better , and they know it .
we have richard webber .
ok--
maybe we should put april on the stand .
kepner ? no .
we &apos;re not calling a witness you just fired as a patient .
but she &apos;s seen me with sofia more than anyone ,
and she &apos;s a good person . she &apos;ll tell the truth .
no , she &apos;s a wild card . it &apos;s too risky .
webber &apos;s good .
he better be .
what is your client prepared to offer as an alternative ?
solomon came up with a plan . he proposed a 50 / 50 split .
visitation rights for dr. robbins
on school breaks and summers .
that puts us right back where we started .
literally . he offered to chop the kid in half .
it &apos;s a reasonable compromise .
yeah , well , you can take your compromise
and shove it up your -- - oh , no . you know what ?
you can --
arizona , look at me .
we are at an impasse here .
if we don &apos;t settle , if we go to trial ,
you risk losing it all .
only one of you is walking out of that court
with sole custody .
i am painfully aware of that .
then i urge you to consider their offer .
their offer is insulting .
and last time i checked , you work for me .
that would be a hard no .
hold .
it all ends if one mom relinquishes her custody .
gamble .
we &apos;re here .
or else they both stand their ground .
we &apos;ll see you in court .
and the kid gets torn apart .
hi , sofia !
mer will be down in a second .
i &apos;m so sorry about this .
please . it &apos;s the best way to spend a day off .
i &apos;m thinking pancakes for breakfast .
with chocolate chips ?
crazytown !
let &apos;s do it .
does , sofia know anything about
what her mommies are doing today ?
nope .
we &apos;re gonna talk to her after we know exactly what &apos;s happening .
you ready ?
come here .
come here . i &apos;m gonna miss you so much .
you know what ?
mama loves you so , so much .
i will see you again before you know it .
i know .
you &apos;re hugging me too tight .
you &apos;re hugging me too long .
callie , we have to go . we don &apos;t want to be late .
come on . come on .
come on . come on .
okay .
let &apos;s go find zola !
she &apos;s gonna be fine .
she &apos;s with maggie . okay , come on .
come on .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
this one is deeper than i would like .
i &apos;ll stitch it up . you have to go .
is the baby okay ?
let &apos;s take a look .
jenny ?
tara .
i heard you fell .
on some dishes .
i was washing them and got soapy water all over the floor .
then i slipped .
i told her i would do them later .
she &apos;s nesting , i think .
mom , cut it out .
there is the baby &apos;s heartbeat -- nice and steady --
and the baby &apos;s active , which is exactly what you want .
i fell really hard . are you sure ?
the baby looks great ,
but i see some free fluid in your abdomen .
it might be bleeding . or amniotic fluid .
jenny , i &apos;m gonna have to take you up and have a look .
surgery ?
no .
no surgery . i don &apos;t want to go through that again .
it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m gonna make a small incision ,
put a scope in there , make sure everything &apos;s all right .
you &apos;ll be there , right ?
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
actually , i wish i could . today i can &apos;t .
dr. russo will monitor the baby .
he &apos;s the ob on call , and he &apos;s great .
i will be there , though . i &apos;m happy to .
don &apos;t you need to get going ?
yeah . i will check in later .
russo &apos;s good , but he can be a little old @-@ school ,
just so you know .
all right . go .
okay .
i can &apos;t believe you dumped kyle with a note .
brutal .
yeah , not my finest moment .
that &apos;s like dumping someone by text , only in 1980 .
remind me why you broke up with him at all ?
you know why .
i know .
it &apos;s just that he &apos;s so hot
and he &apos;s into you and he plays guitar ,
and he &apos;s sick , so you always know where he is .
i know . you had to choose between doctor and girlfriend .
you made the right choice .
thank you .
however , there are countless other brains to cut into
but a limited number of butts like his .
keep your eyes on your own butt .
well , i , uh , ground the beans myself .
thanks . let &apos;s go .
wait , wait .
we have a few minutes .
how you feeling ?
robbins .
it &apos;ll be tough , but right now , you have to look past the pain
to what you &apos;ll have when they &apos;re done .
&quot; at the end , you &apos;ll have a baby . &quot;
that &apos;s what i tell all the laboring moms .
you &apos;re not drinking .
okay .
we &apos;re here today to determine
a custody modification of a minor
between two divorced parents ,
arizona robbins and calliope torres .
the trial &apos;s witness pool is unusual
in that it &apos;ll be shared by both parents .
the parties have stipulated to call each witness once ,
at which time ,
each side will have a chance to examine that witness .
if you &apos;re testifying , remember --
this is not a popularity contest .
you are not choosing sides .
we &apos;re all on the same side --
the side of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child .
dr. torres , dr. robbins ,
custody hearings are , without exception ,
very difficult on all parties involved ,
your daughter included .
things said here will undoubtedly be harsh
and cannot be unsaid .
i ask this of parents before i begin any custody hearing .
are you both sure you want to proceed ?
yes , your honor . i &apos;m sure .
dr. torres .
i &apos;m sure , your honor .
then this court is now in session
to determine sole physical custody
of sofia robbin sloan torres .
torres and i worked together on a pro bono project
building prosthetics for injured vets .
and that &apos;s a very meaningful project for you
because you &apos;re a vet yourself .
is that correct ?
yes , i served as a surgeon in the army .
charity work and the vet card .
that &apos;s smart .
yeah , it &apos;s not good for robbins .
what was the connection for dr. torres ?
well , she just cares .
while she didn &apos;t serve ,
she &apos;s always been willing to pitch in , to help .
she &apos;s a very empathetic person .
big @-@ hearted .
has dr. torres discussed her move to new york with you ?
she has .
did you feel it was a sudden move ?
um , well , not for her . i mean , it was sudden
because dr. blake &apos;s schedule determined the move ,
but for callie , no .
this is who she is .
she gets thrown a situation -- it doesn &apos;t daunt her .
it inspires her .
i &apos;ve seen it time and time again in the o.r.
she just jumps in .
and this is no different .
she &apos;s found a great school for sofia ,
and she &apos;s making the best of a tough situation with grace .
it &apos;s something i admire about her .
no further questions at this time .
you live with dr. robbins , don &apos;t you ?
i rent a room in her house .
i bet you never expected to be living with a 6 @-@ year @-@ old .
yeah , sure . i wasn &apos;t , uh , thrilled
to be living with a kid , uh ,
till i started living with one .
i had never been around a lot of kids before ,
but sofia &apos;s a blast .
she &apos;s so smart and hilarious .
i mean , she and her mom are just laughing all the time .
the place is so happy .
sofia makes the place happy .
we see so much dark stuff every day at work .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s really nice to come home to a happy kid .
so , would you say you love sofia ?
i -- i have come to . yes .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
and how long have you known sofia now ?
well , we met a few months ago .
oh , and how well would you say you &apos;ve gotten to know sofia
in the few months that you &apos;ve spent together , dr. blake ?
very well .
very well . that &apos;s good .
that &apos;s , uh , very good .
what &apos;s her favorite color ?
blue .
her favorite toy ?
objection . irrelevant . this isn &apos;t a quiz show .
i &apos;m trying to establish the nature
of dr. blake &apos;s relationship with sofia .
i &apos;ll allow it .
her favorite toy is astronaut barbie .
her favorite cereal is whole grain o &apos;s .
her favorite animal is a unicorn .
her favorite sea creature is a mermaid .
and her bedtime is 8 : 30 .
and her favorite thing to do in the morning
is pick out her outfit .
you can ask me anything you want .
5mm scope .
so , why aren &apos;t you there ?
in court ?
why aren &apos;t you there ?
i &apos;ve seen enough people fighting over kids .
i &apos;ve had enough of fighting over my own ,
and mine &apos;s not even born yet .
well , there &apos;s the free fluid .
suction irrigator , please .
how are we looking here , dr. karev ?
uh , well , that &apos;s not blood .
oh , no .
looks like amniotic fluid .
show me the uterine fundus , please .
damn it . uterus is perforated .
let me have a look there .
thank you .
getting fluid in her abdomen .
this pregnancy has just become non @-@ viable .
this baby &apos;s barely viable outside that womb .
it &apos;s only 24 weeks .
you can repair it , can &apos;t you ?
i can try .
throw in a plasma patch , hope for the best .
&quot; hope for the best ? &quot;
it &apos;s experimental ,
but if we want to prolong this pregnancy --
of course we do .
then a patch is the way to go .
five seconds ago , you wanted to deliver .
now you &apos;re confident in a plasma patch ?
dr. karev , i am the ob on call here .
you are a peds surgeon .
if i say that a patch is best , a patch is best .
kepner ?
if it keeps the baby in ,
i vote for the patch .
stay in your lane , dr. karev .
prep albumin polymers , please .
i &apos;ll update the mom .
how &apos;d it go ? how &apos;s jenny ?
well , she &apos;s still in surgery but doing great .
we located the source of the leak ,
and dr. russo &apos;s repairing it right now .
and the baby ?
the baby is healthy and still in utero ,
which is what we want .
it &apos;s too little to be born , right ?
it wouldn &apos;t be ideal .
i @-@ i need you to sign one more form
for dr. russo &apos;s repair .
it seems like i was just here
signing these for jenny &apos;s last surgery .
i just had a feeling .
i said goodbye .
i left for work .
i was two blocks away
and i had an awful , just sick feeling .
i turned around , i drove home , and there she was --
on the floor , blood everywhere .
i just had a terrible feeling
that something was really wrong .
it &apos;s a good thing you did .
and your work schedule will be pretty grueling , i &apos;d imagine .
actually , it &apos;s a research fellowship ,
so it will be far more predictable
than a surgery resident &apos;s schedule .
oh , i see .
what was sofia wearing this morning ?
what ?
what was she wearing today ?
i -- i don &apos;t know .
you didn &apos;t see her this morning ?
no , i @-@ i did .
i just , uh --
i can &apos;t , um , recall exactly what it --
objection . relevance .
moving on .
what grade is sofia in ?
second .
no , first .
she &apos;s in first grade .
i have to go , and this is getting hard to watch .
are you sure ?
yes .
because you didn &apos;t sound sure ,
and you keep saying this is a child that you know ,
a child that you &apos;re gonna soon co @-@ parent .
i @-@ i @-@ i can see - how you might not remember ...
... what color tutu she wore to school today ,
but to not even know what grade she &apos;s in --
so many objections .
badgering , irrelevant --
sustained .
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t mean to belabor the point ,
but you said it yourself .
you &apos;ve only known sofia a few months , so --
no , that is not what i meant .
but that is what you said .
all right , counselor .
i know what grade she &apos;s in .
i do .
i do .
no further questions , your honor .
maybe it wasn &apos;t that bad .
that was really , really bad .
oh , god .
but it doesn &apos;t kill us . not yet .
i can &apos;t believe arizona let them pull that slimy bull--
it was a smart move , and it worked .
but we &apos;ve got smarter moves .
let me put dr. grey on the stand tomorrow ,
and she &apos;s gonna close strong .
look confident .
you &apos;re the chief of surgery .
doctors torres and robbins report to you .
that is correct .
and for those of us who aren &apos;t surgeons ,
dr. torres operates on bones
while dr. robbins operates on babies .
is that correct ?
well , fetuses and babies . yes .
how does the schedule of an orthopedic surgeon
compare to that of a fetal surgeon ?
it varies day to day .
i see , but in your opinion ,
which specialty has more unscheduled surgeries ?
ortho or fetal ?
there &apos;s really no comparison .
but dr. robbins &apos; schedule is dictated
by the unpredictable nature of childbirth , is it not ?
objection . speculation .
she can &apos;t do that .
you can &apos;t do that .
i asked if dr. robbins &apos; schedule
is dictated by the unpredictable nature of childbirth .
objection . speculation .
your honor , i &apos;m asking an expert witness her opinion .
it &apos;s only speculation if counsel is calling into question
the expertise of this witness as chief .
overruled . counselor , proceed .
dr. robbins &apos; schedule is unpredictable ,
wouldn &apos;t you say ?
it can be , yes . any surgeon &apos;s --
sure , but how many unscheduled emergency procedures
did dr. robbins log over the past six months ?
i have no idea .
i would like to introduce into evidence document 2c .
take a look . this might refresh your memory .
what is that report , doctor ?
this is a list of - emergency procedures performed
by dr. robbins and dr. torres for the past six months .
and according to that document ,
how many emergency procedures
did dr. torres log in the past six months ?
27 .
27 .
and how many did dr. robbins log ?
92 .
92 .
now , even for a surgeon ,
wouldn &apos;t you call that kind of schedule grueling ?
you can say that . i wouldn &apos;t .
i would say it &apos;s wildly successful ,
but then , i would never put
a woman &apos;s success in the con column .
what about her daughter , though ?
92 .
92 times she dropped everything ,
sofia included , to go to a job .
would you ask that if she were a man ?
92 times she chose work over her child .
your honor --
92 times dr. robbins was saving babies ,
saving parents from losing their own children !
no further questions .
don &apos;t get discouraged .
they &apos;re trying to turn your strength into weakness .
this court is adjourned until tomorrow .
no , over here .
right up against the bed .
god , mom . just go home to sleep .
this is so embarrassing .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s a nightmare .
that &apos;s right . i &apos;m everybody &apos;s nightmare .
can i have another blanket , please ?
sure .
how &apos;s everyone feeling ?
i hear you &apos;re sleeping over tonight .
thank god you &apos;re back .
she &apos;s nicer to me when you &apos;re around .
surgery went well ?
yeah . russo did a plasma patch .
yeah , that &apos;s a good call .
this baby needs more time .
okay , listen . i &apos;m sorry that i wasn &apos;t here for the surgery ,
but i &apos;ll be checking in later , okay ?
i told you . kepner and i have jenny handled .
she &apos;s doing fine . the baby &apos;s good .
everyone &apos;s stable .
um , where &apos;s russo ?
i need to look at a post @-@ op ultrasound
to make sure the leak is sealed .
should you be here ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at home getting ready for court or something ?
no . i shouldn &apos;t be here .
i should be at home fixing my daughter ice cream
and reading her &quot; charlotte &apos;s web . &quot;
so could you please page russo
so i can look at the ultrasounds
and get the hell out of here ?
okay .
thank you .
it &apos;s an impossible situation .
a break @-@ up is tough enough as it is ,
but with a kid in the mix ...
i can &apos;t even imagine .
i mean , just because you &apos;re not
the parent who gave birth to the kid
doesn &apos;t make the kid any less yours .
biology or not ,
no parent ever fought to stick around for me .
it was a horrible mistake .
the custody battle ?
me breaking up with kyle .
i told you that .
who &apos;s kyle ?
he was a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime butt .
i said that , too .
i &apos;m calling him .
mm , the -- the drunk @-@ dial .
it &apos;s a bad idea .
i &apos;m not drunk .
steph , look at me .
you have 10 more seconds to talk about him ,
and then no more kyle talk .
i said that to you .
i know .
10 , 9 ...
shut up . i &apos;m calling him .
and it is not drunk @-@ dialing , sir .
it is me undoing my mistake .
okay . - i --
give it back .
no .
you are a good friend .
i know .
so , what were you thinking ?
okay , um ...
when the baby &apos;s born --
starting day 1 , huh ?
i would like to be in the room for the birth .
um , so if that makes you uncomfortable --
no , not at all .
really ?
yeah .
yeah , i want you there .
okay . um ...
well , when the baby &apos;s on a feeding schedule ,
whenever that happens , then i &apos;m thinking weekends ?
you don &apos;t want to split the week ?
i do . yes .
but when the baby &apos;s older ,
we may need to switch to every other week .
i &apos;ve read that that is just -- - easier on the child .
yeah , i @-@ i read that , too .
but i want easter .
it &apos;s important to me .
i go to church , and you -- - worship the easter bunny .
right .
now , are we talking easter egg hunts
or just church ?
yeah , of course there will be an easter egg hunt .
all right , then easter &apos;s all yours .
uh , and you can have the super bowl and halloween .
mm . sure .
okay , now , what about , uh , christmas ?
we switch off .
we switch off . we , uh , make a plan .
we respect the plan .
we don &apos;t fight .
yeah , we don &apos;t fight .
okay , sweetie .
yeah , no , it &apos;s past your bedtime .
okay . hey .
i love you .
okay . no , no , no .
no , i don &apos;t want to talk to mommy , okay ?
okay , bye --
i feel gross .
i feel gross . court covered me in a layer of gross
no amount of wine can wash away .
tequila ?
mnh @-@ mnh .
you know , you don &apos;t have to stay .
i &apos;ll be fine alone till penny gets home .
oh . that won &apos;t be for hours .
i buried her in scut and post @-@ ops .
i &apos;ll call you a cab .
go home and see your kids .
my kids are asleep .
they &apos;re with maggie and amelia .
what if last night was our last night ?
stop . don &apos;t do that .
i am doing this all wrong .
mark used to say that .
you know ...
... when the kids were babies ,
he used to call me all the time when sofia would cry
or she got soap in her eye
and he didn &apos;t know what to do .
he called you ? he had two moms !
yeah , but the two of you were so on top of it ,
he didn &apos;t want you to know .
so he swore me to secrecy .
he would hate this .
so much .
he would find it unacceptable .
i lie awake every night
thinking maybe i started something i shouldn &apos;t have .
i shouldn &apos;t have to choose between the person that i love
and the person i love .
i hope you don &apos;t have to .
i tried ... not to love penny , mer .
i tried .
so hard .
i know . this all sucks .
come on , sofia , honey .
you had a really good time with her yesterday , okay ?
unh @-@ unh .
yes ! you did .
you built forts and it was really fun .
morning ! come on in !
i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s been a really rough morning .
she woke up really early
and then she didn &apos;t have breakfast , so --
that &apos;s okay . we will make waffles , or --
i &apos;m going with you .
i -- oh , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . mommy can &apos;t today .
i &apos;m running late , and you &apos;re here to play with zola ,
but i will be back just as soon as i can .
no .
i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i love you .
i hate you .
okay , let &apos;s go find zola .
she &apos;ll be fine .
hey . how &apos;s jenny doing ?
she did okay overnight ,
but her mean pressure is trending down .
i don &apos;t like it .
what does russo say ?
russo says to watch and wait ,
but i &apos;m thinking about texting arizona .
arizona doesn &apos;t have all the answers .
she has more answers than russo .
and you &apos;re just pissy because she fired you as a patient .
shut up . she &apos;s got enough on her plate today .
okay , look . - if russo says watch and wait ,
i say we watch and wait .
any evidence of fetal distress on the monitor ,
just let me know , okay ?
and dr. torres and sofia couldn &apos;t possibly be any closer .
so , you &apos;ve seen them together frequently over the years .
all the time .
they went to the same daycare
and now - they &apos;re at the same school .
sofia &apos;s actually at my house right now .
and what about dr. blake ?
in your estimation , how does she get along with sofia ?
great . sofia loves penny .
she &apos;s a great kid like that .
she &apos;s very open to new people as long as they &apos;re good people ,
and penny is a very good person .
thank you , dr. grey .
it &apos;s your witness , ms. gamble .
you mentioned that sofia is at your house today , dr. grey .
she is .
it must be nice for you and dr. torres
to have daughters around the same age .
and they get along , right ?
it is very nice .
they love playing together .
so , who &apos;s watching your daughters
right now while you &apos;re here ?
their aunt amelia .
you recently lost your husband .
is that correct ?
i did .
my sincerest condolences .
thank you .
so , you &apos;re a single parent .
i am .
and callie &apos;s a single parent .
is that a question , or --
so you two must help each other out a lot --
two single parents .
callie drops sofia off at your place sometimes
when she has to work or when she has plans
or when she needs a night off . correct ?
a &quot; night off &quot; ?
being a mom isn &apos;t a job .
we don &apos;t punch in and punch out .
there are no nights off .
we are both single parents .
that &apos;s not a dirty word .
but we do need help getting our kids to where they need to be
with all of their limbs intact .
so we lean on each other .
that &apos;s not a sign of weakness or bad parenting ,
if that &apos;s where you &apos;re going with this .
it takes a village , and we have a village .
here in seattle .
what ?
the village you just mentioned --
the seamless support system these mothers built ,
this essential network .
it &apos;s all here in seattle .
sofia &apos;s friends and her school , her teachers --
her home is here in seattle .
that &apos;s what sofia would be leaving .
is that what you &apos;re saying ?
no . i was saying --
no further questions , your honor .
dr. robbins was already a brilliant pediatric surgeon ,
but since she &apos;s completed her fellowship ,
i &apos;ve watched her turn into
one of the most renowned fetal surgeons in the country .
a child would be lucky to have her as a role model parent .
no further questions , your honor .
dr. webber , you work with dr. robbins -- is that correct ?
uh , yes , that &apos;s correct .
would you say there &apos;s overlap between your specialties ?
yes , there is .
so , you two have gotten close over the years .
professionally .
we have . yes .
are you a trivia buff ?
yes .
so , you and dr. robbins have enjoyed trivia nights together .
that &apos;s correct , yes .
you go and play , drink ,
and flirt with women -- is that correct ?
no , it isn &apos;t . i &apos;m married and i don &apos;t drink .
so dr. robbins did all the drinking and flirting .
you just went for the trivia ?
that &apos;s an over @-@ simplified --
it &apos;s a yes or no question , dr. webber .
yes .
you &apos;re good at trivia ?
sure .
don &apos;t be modest .
how many times do you think you and dr. robbins have won
over the past , oh , let &apos;s say six months ?
i wasn &apos;t counting .
the bar was . they kept a running tally .
does this piece of evidence , document 3c ,
refresh your recollection ?
you &apos;ve won 25 times in the past six months .
that &apos;s 25 nights dr. robbins was out drinking with you ,
not including the times you lost .
where was sofia during those evenings ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t quite catch that .
i said i wasn &apos;t privy to her childcare schedule .
i would like to introduce into evidence document 4c .
it is a transcript of text messages
from dr. robbins to dr. torres
asking her to take sofia unexpectedly .
callie and i swap all the time .
we have very flexible schedules .
could you please tell the court the tally at the bottom ?
dr. webber ?
34 .
34 .
she asked dr. torres to switch with her 34 times .
we know she was out with you at least 25 times .
and that &apos;s in addition to the previously mentioned
92 times dr. robbins was unavailable
to parent her own child due to her professional demands .
now , let &apos;s just pause and think about this for a minute .
there are only 180 days in six months &apos; time ,
and so far , we &apos;ve counted approximately 150 times
in which dr. robbins shirked her duties .
150 out of 180 .
objection . badgering the witness .
calls for speculation .
sustained .
your honor , we &apos;d like to request a short recess .
so , callie &apos;s okay slut @-@ shaming me now ?
don &apos;t let them rattle you .
they &apos;re making it sound like a working mom is a bad mom .
i mean , we just lost in there , right ?
&apos;cause they made me sound like
i was a selfish , irresponsible , sex @-@ crazed --
arizona . -i don &apos;t --
stop .
you have your chance right now .
they tried to rewrite the story .
now &apos;s your chance to set it straight .
you need to get up there , tell them the truth .
judge kane is smart .
she &apos;ll know the truth when she hears it .
you tell the truth , and you will win this .
when sofia was born , how did that day start for you ?
i was in a car accident .
can you tell us what you remember about the accident ?
i don &apos;t remember much , but i remember --
i remember waking up on the hood of the car
and i was covered in glass .
i was , um , barely --
i &apos;m so sorry .
take all the time you need .
i was barely conscious , um ,
and the only thing that i could feel was just pain all over .
i could have died on the hood of that car .
and i wanted to give up .
but ... i couldn &apos;t because i was pregnant with sofia .
and if i died ... she died .
so ... i had to fight ...
to stay alive , for my daughter &apos;s sake .
being a mother is the reason i &apos;m still alive today .
jenny , your bp &apos;s borderline low ,
but otherwise , your cardiac evaluation is good .
so , she &apos;s cleared for surgery .
surgery . what surgery ?
what happened ?
dr. russo says we have to deliver .
jenny &apos;s still leaking amniotic fluid ,
which means we &apos;re out of time .
we need to do a c @-@ section , deliver this baby .
right now ? i @-@ it &apos;s too early , right ?
it &apos;s not ideal , but there may be no choice .
please don &apos;t . not yet .
i don &apos;t want my baby to die .
honey , everything is gonna be fine .
can i see you outside ?
if that baby comes out now --
it has to .
the fetal heart rate &apos;s already showing decreased variability .
well , what can we do ?
i can deliver , then you do what you can for the baby .
it &apos;s hard to keep those babies alive . the odds suck .
compromised lungs , high risk of brain bleeds .
it &apos;s the only option left .
it &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
so , i just lied to my daughter , and i will go back in there
and keep telling her that she &apos;ll be okay no matter what ,
but to do that , i need to know that you have done
everything in your power to make this okay .
can you tell me that ?
tell me that you have done everything you can
to keep my baby and grandchild alive .
robbins wouldn &apos;t deliver .
do you have another option ?
then i &apos;ll see you in surgery .
is robbins an option ?
no .
dr. robbins , you were with dr. torres
before she was pregnant .
yes .
were you together when she got pregnant ?
no .
so her pregnancy was not an agreement
you entered into together , correct ?
no .
it was an agreement she entered into
with dr. mark sloan , correct ?
they agreed after the fact ,
but , yes , mark was sofia &apos;s father .
callie and i were together .
we were a couple before the pregnancy
and then after sofia was conceived .
so , you became part of the parenting plan later , correct ?
just to be clear ,
dr. sloan and dr. torres were sofia &apos;s parents
and then you came around .
no , i didn &apos;t &quot; come around . &quot;
i &apos;m sofia &apos;s mother . i legally adopted her .
she doesn &apos;t want to go there .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
her last names are sloan and torres .
i &apos;m gonna have to stop you before you continue
for your own sake .
you &apos;re not going to imply that i &apos;m any less sofia &apos;s mother
because we don &apos;t share the same dna .
dr. robbins , excuse me .
because that would be offensive . it would be offensive
to anyone in the room who has an adopted child
or is an adopted child , and for you to say that --
dr. robbins --
i chose to be sofia &apos;s mother !
it did not fall into my lap .
there was a choice , and i could stay or i could run ,
and i chose motherhood .
and it was the best choice that i ever made .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m a doctor , and i @-@ i have to answer my phone , so i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
somewhere more important to be ?
actually , yes .
excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i love my child , and i want her with me ,
but i know that , no matter how this ends ,
she &apos;ll survive .
she &apos;ll be healthy and safe
and well @-@ taken care of and loved .
because ...
we are her mothers .
but there &apos;s a child at the hospital who will not survive
unless i am there , so i have to --
i have to -- i have to go .
i am through the uterine wall .
more suction , please .
vitals are holding .
why isn &apos;t he stopping ? did you ask him to stop ?
yes . but he &apos;s insisting on taking the baby out .
is he into the uterus ?
yes .
well , did he cut the cord ?
no , but he &apos;s close .
tell him not to . damn it !
i did .
okay , everyone .
change of plans .
dr. russo , please stop what you &apos;re doing .
excuse me ?
hi , tara . hi , jenny .
you &apos;re doing great , okay ? hey , karev .
cord &apos;s intact .
beautiful .
dr. russo . i said stop . now , please .
robbins , i &apos;ve almost completed the c @-@ section .
but you won &apos;t be finishing it .
someone tell me what &apos;s going on right now .
um , tara and jenny , i am going to put that baby back in there
so it can cook a little bit more .
how &apos;s that sound to you ?
you can do that ?
it &apos;s not too late ?
it is too late .
she &apos;s already lost most of the amniotic fluid .
there &apos;s not enough left .
i &apos;m going to fill the depleted uterus with lactated ringer &apos;s ,
and the baby &apos;s gonna be fine .
warren , how &apos;s she doing ?
pressure &apos;s holding steady , but we should hurry .
okay . mom , i need your consent .
dr. robbins can give the baby more time .
every additional week this baby stays inside ,
the better the chances of its survival .
mom ?
we trust dr. robbins .
okay . uh , dr. russo , thank you for your help .
please scrub out .
unbelievable .
okay , jenny .
we &apos;re gonna put you out for now , all right ?
tara , you want to say hi to your grandbaby ?
what is it ?
it &apos;s a girl .
you have a daughter .
is she pretty ?
she &apos;s beautiful . she looks just like you did .
okay . we need to say goodbye to her now .
goodbye for now .
goodbye , little girl .
no matter what the judge decides ,
i know that you &apos;re a good mom , too .
and i just want you to know this doesn &apos;t change that .
the things that you let them say about me --
i would never have done that to you .
never .
i &apos;m sorry . the judge is ready for you .
all rise and come to order .
honorable judge madeline kane presiding .
please be seated .
i &apos;ve taken all testimony
and evidence in this matter under submission .
and after careful consideration , my ruling is as follows .
i hereby grant sole physical custody
of sofia robbin sloan torres to ...
oh . have you heard anything ?
no , not yet .
robbins said she &apos;d text as soon as the judge decided .
torres , too .
this sucks .
what the hell ?
give him a stat ct with contrast .
what happened ? why wasn &apos;t i paged ?
why would you care ?
he passed out . possible meningitis .
she &apos;s not my doctor .
i don &apos;t want her here .
get her out of here .
wilson .
no , don &apos;t . i &apos;m --
i &apos;m going .
i &apos;m going .
if you &apos;re wondering how the solomon story ends ...
did you get all your things from upstairs , sofia ?
your books and everything ?
... spoiler alert --
the true mom would rather give her baby up
than have it ripped in two .
hi , sweetie .
but what happens when there are two true mothers ?
how the hell did this happen ?
how ?
how the hell did this happen ?
that &apos;s a no @-@ win situation .
mommy .
can we go home now ?
yeah . we sure can .
let &apos;s go home .
that is an entirely different story .
