vampires and werewolves used to roam freely
until a shaman put a curse on them
to limit their power .
since then , werewolves can only turn on a full moon ,
and vampires are weakened by the sun .
you &apos;re saying that the oldest vampire
in the history of time is coming after me ?
klaus is the most feared and hated of the originals ,
but i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m prepared to offer you deal .
do you trust elijah ?
he &apos;s an original . he can &apos;t be trusted .
elena told me you &apos;re both working for elijah ,
so don &apos;t lie about it .
i &apos;m jules .
i know you &apos;re a werewolf .
do you know where mason is ?
he &apos;s dead , tyler .
i don &apos;t know who to trust .
you just stood there ! when they were going to kill us ,
you just stood there ! you didn &apos;t do anything !
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s too late because we &apos;re not friends anymore .
thanks for coming .
i &apos;m not afraid of a vampire .
we will take you .
i &apos;m not so sure about that , tough guy .
elijah made a promise to elena .
i &apos;m here to see it &apos;s upheld .
i don &apos;t know what mason was doing here in the first place .
because of this rock he was trying to find .
what rock ?
a moonstone .
where is it now ?
i couldn &apos;t tell you .
go ahead . tell her .
let me just preface this with a big disclaimer
that screams , &quot; i should have known better . &quot;
what is it , stevie ?
when brady told me what that tyler kid said
about mason being here for the moonstone ,
something clicked .
there was this moment back in florida
when i suspected mason was up to something
because he was banging that
hot vampire chick kathy
and he didn &apos;t want anyone to know .
all right . just get to the point , stevie .
that is the point , jules .
it &apos;s the sun and moon curse .
mason was asking me all kinds of questions about it ,
if it could be broken , and when that evil man @-@ witch
showed up last night , double @-@ click ,
which is vampires , moonstone .
they &apos;re putting everything in place to break the curse .
we can &apos;t let them do that ,
even if we have to kill every last vampire in this town .
go away .
hello .
elena !
how was the slumber party ?
good . heh . much needed .
when can you and i have one ?
that can be arranged .
ok .
now . today .
take me far , far away .
even with everything that &apos;s going on ?
because of everything that &apos;s going on .
and you &apos;re sure this has nothing to do with dodging your father
who just got into town ?
uh , this has everything to do with that .
well , in that case , where would you like to go ?
i &apos;m late .
this is such a crazy day .
i &apos;m , uh , covering the historical society &apos;s high tea .
ooh ! thrilling .
yeah . it &apos;s for some visiting writer .
he &apos;s writing a book on small @-@ town virginia .
it &apos;s a big snooze .
writer ? what &apos;s his name ?
uh , elijah smith .
smith . he &apos;s using smith ?
ok . you have your story straight in your mind , right ?
i can &apos;t say that you bit me or drank my blood ,
just that we hit it off and i really like you .
you are terrific , though .
you &apos;re sweet , funny , you &apos;re honest .
and you &apos;re falling hard .
you might be the one .
perfect .
have a great day , honey .
oh . hey , alaric .
later .
my new girlfriend--
andie star , action news .
it &apos;s not called action news .
i know . i just like saying it . come on .
so john gilbert gave me this to kill elijah .
said you have to dip the
dagger in the remains of an old white ash tree
that dates back to the originals ,
if there &apos;s any truth in that .
so you think it &apos;s a setup ?
it could be . guy &apos;s a weasel .
wouldn &apos;t put anything past him .
what are you up to today , mr. saltzman ?
well , jenna and i were supposed to go
to her family &apos;s lake house ,
but somehow , we both got roped into doing
this historical society thing at the lockwoods .
where elijah &apos;s the guest of honor .
tell me you &apos;re not gonna kill him at the tea party .
no . that would be stupid .
i want to know his endgame before i kill him ,
but i do think it &apos;s time elijah and i officially met .
ok . so tell me about this big witchy plan
you &apos;ve been cooking up .
we still don &apos;t know the extent of what elijah &apos;s up to .
no , we don &apos;t .
so i &apos;m gonna ask luka to tell me what he knows .
and he &apos;s not gonna tell you anything .
i didn &apos;t say he was gonna have a choice .
what ?
what &apos;s that about ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . i thought that we were ...
i don &apos;t know .
tyler , hi .
you &apos;re still here .
is that all right with you ?
that guy last night made it pretty clear
you needed to go .
and we will soon .
listen . we kind of need your help with something .
we need you to help us find the moonstone .
somebody needs to explain to me
what the big deal is about a rock .
that rock helps break the curse of the sun and the moon .
i don &apos;t know what that means .
it &apos;s an old curse placed on both
vampires and werewolves .
vampires break the curse ,
they &apos;re free to walk in the sunlight ,
but we &apos;re stuck only turning at the full moon ,
aka werewolf armageddon .
but if we break it , they &apos;re stuck as night @-@ walkers ,
and we can turn whenever we want .
aka werewolf domination .
tyler , if we can turn at will ,
that means we never have to turn at all ,
not if we don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;d never have to turn again ?
there &apos;s more . stevie .
if those vamps are gearing up to break the curse ,
they must have also found the doppelganger .
the doppelganger ?
evil twin shadow person .
we &apos;re betting mason &apos;s hot vampire chick
kathy knows all about it ,
so we need you to help us find kathy .
i have a--a picture .
mason brought her to the bar once .
no one liked her . she was a vampire .
bad news .
right--right here . the girl next to mason .
that &apos;s elena gilbert .
you know her ?
i &apos;ve known her my whole life .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m working .
yeah , ok . i can see that ,
but can you work and talk ?
what do you want , caroline ?
uh , i want to talk about what we were supposed to talk about
last night before i had to cancel on you .
i want us to clear up the weirdness .
i just want us to talk about us .
now you &apos;re just making it worse .
uh , i--i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on , matt .
where were you last night
when you were supposed to be with me ?
i--
and don &apos;t say you were with bonnie
because bonnie was here , caroline .
i saw her .
yeah .
matt !
caroline .
you stay away from me .
it &apos;s important .
just stop it , tyler , ok ?
you &apos;re just-- you &apos;re just making it worse .
please , caroline .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened , ok ,
but there &apos;s so much we need to talk about .
i said just leave me alone .
the two of you want to get together , fine .
there &apos;s nothing i can do about it ,
but do me a favor , and both of you stop lying about it .
matt , there &apos;s nothing going on .
hey ! i said stop lying .
are you ready for our romantic weekend ?
beyond ready .
let &apos;s go before john shows up
and pretends to be a concerned father .
mmm . i &apos;ll go put these in the car .
uh , please tell me there &apos;s nothing wrong .
nothing &apos;s wrong . just caroline .
come on . let &apos;s go .
she &apos;s going to dunham lake .
her family has a house up there .
nice . let &apos;s go get our doppelger .
you all right ?
i &apos;m good . i just haven &apos;t been back here since before .
oh , my god .
elena , listen . just say the word , all right ?
we &apos;ll get back on that highway ,
we &apos;ll go anywhere else .
i &apos;ve always loved it here .
i want it to stay that way , i was just ...
having a moment .
ok .
you don &apos;t have to wait out there . i &apos;m all good .
oh , that &apos;s great because i &apos;m , uh ...
i &apos;m stuck .
oh , my god . you can &apos;t get in .
not gonna be a very romantic weekend
unless you , uh , invite me inside .
stefan , i can &apos;t .
what ?
my parent &apos;s left this place to john gilbert .
he &apos;s the only one who can invite you in .
i &apos;m sorry . i completely forgot .
you &apos;re kidding me , right ?
stefan salvatore , i hereby invite you into this home .
you are such a liar .
hey , hey , hey !
have you spent much time in richmond for your book ?
there &apos;s such a wealth of history there .
no . i &apos;m focusing mostly on the smaller regions of virginia .
lots of research . strictly academic .
that &apos;s fascinating .
damon , what are you doing here ?
hi . you came .
hi .
hi .
thanks for introducing us , jenna .
damon .
carol .
what a surprise .
hi .
hi . elijah ,
i want you to meet damon salvatore .
his family is one of mystic falls &apos; founding families .
such a pleasure to meet you .
no . pleasure &apos;s mine .
come bearing coffee gifts .
so you &apos;re talking to me now .
i found out what your dad did ,
saving my friends from the wolf pack .
well , had i known that &apos;s all it took ...
hey . how &apos;s it going ?
what are you doing here ?
bonnie called . i wanted to help .
how &apos;s it going ?
she &apos;s selling it , and he &apos;s buying it .
she &apos;s giving him the sex smile .
all right , caroline . i get it .
what do you say ? you want to play a game ?
yeah .
yeah ?
yeah .
what &apos;s happening to me ?
you &apos;ll be ok .
ooh . ooh ! why don &apos;t we go over here ?
i got him , i got him .
what kind of witch roofie was that ?
strong one .
having another moment ?
jeremy broke his arm diving off this dock when he was 6 .
my dad taught me how to fish
right off the edge up there .
so many memories .
do you ever think about us ,
what our future will be like , our memories ?
i think there are long conversations
to be head about our future ,
about the kind of life we could have together .
now there &apos;s a box that we shouldn &apos;t open .
oh , we can open it .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
no . i &apos;d rather just be here ... now .
you know , this is a future memory .
it &apos;s where your boyfriend
whispered to you
that he loved you .
i love you .
what &apos;s damon doing with elijah ?
how would i know ?
because you &apos;re his little helper .
if you say so , john .
does jenna know about your extracurricular activities ?
maybe it &apos;s time we tell her .
i mean , she can &apos;t stay in the dark forever .
you &apos;re a dick .
i don &apos;t think you should sleep over anymore .
it &apos;s inappropriate with children in the house ,
and that ring that isobel gave you , that &apos;s mine .
i &apos;m gonna want that back .
what can i do for you , damon ?
i was hoping we could have a word .
where &apos;s elena ?
safe with stefan .
they &apos;re laying low , you know .
bit of a werewolf problem .
oh , yeah . i heard about that .
i &apos;m sure you did since it was your witch
that saved the day .
you are welcome .
which adds to my confusion
on exactly why you &apos;re here .
why don &apos;t you just stay focused on keeping elena safe
and leave the rest to me .
not good enough .
you young vampires , so arrogant .
how dare you come in here and challenge me ?
you can &apos;t kill me , man .
it &apos;s not part of the deal .
silence .
i &apos;m an original .
show a little respect .
the moment you cease to be of use to me , you &apos;re dead ,
so you should do what i say .
keep elena safe .
my dad did all the cooking , too .
and your mom ?
she sat right here and watched .
she couldn &apos;t cook either .
fire &apos;s dying .
oh , yeah . i &apos;ll go get more wood .
i got it .
no , no . it &apos;s cold outside .
so i &apos;ll get a jacket .
my mom &apos;s perfume .
jenna was supposed to pack all this up ,
but ...
she kept putting it off .
i don &apos;t blame her .
here .
bundle up .
it was my great granddad &apos;s .
and you look very hot in it .
i look hot in your dead great granddad &apos;s jacket ?
beyond hot .
stefan ! it &apos;s my parents &apos; bedroom .
what ?
what ?
this is hollow inside .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a really good hiding place .
oh , my god .
we only have , like , an hour or two
before my mom gets home ,
and these are all i could find .
place these evenly around the room .
how does this work ?
um , i &apos;ll put him in a trance
and ask him questions .
it &apos;s like hypnosis .
you sure you &apos;re strong enough for this ?
that &apos;s what the candles are for .
i &apos;ll draw power from the flames .
i &apos;ll get the matches .
i got it .
never gonna get used to that .
oh , come on . that &apos;s pretty hot , and you know it .
in need a bowl of water .
yeah , yeah . i &apos;ll go get it .
ok . what was that ? &quot; it &apos;s hot &quot; ?
he is so crushing on you .
so ?
so ...
what , you &apos;d rather be with
traitor warlock over here ?
i &apos;m not into luka .
it &apos;s just , you know , he understood me ,
and he was new and different .
and you &apos;ve known jeremy since forever ,
and you only see him one way ,
as elena &apos;s brother ,
but you &apos;re a witch , and i &apos;m a vampire .
you know , it &apos;s not like we &apos;re in any position
to be picky .
no .
to judge .
looks like he &apos;s waking up .
today was a bust .
yeah . how &apos;s the throat ?
sore .
yeah . that elijah &apos;s one scary dude
but with nice hair .
hey . you want another one ?
he &apos;s gonna be hard to kill .
yeah . i &apos;d think twice before i &apos;d trust
that dagger and some ashes to do the job .
you &apos;re gonna need more info .
i &apos;m out of sources .
what &apos;s up with you and this news chick ?
she &apos;s got spunk , huh ?
just don &apos;t kill her , please .
if i did , who would report her death ?
just don &apos;t do it , all right ?
she &apos;s friends with jenna , and it &apos;s bad enough
that i &apos;m lying to her about everything else .
i hate the lies .
oh , god . i got to go .
i got to pick jenna up .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll , uh , show myself out .
good luck .
whew ! damn , you &apos;re strong .
it took the whole syringe .
grab that one . he &apos;s dead .
hi , damon .
nice to see you again .
these must be the other jonathan gilbert journals .
jeremy had the one ,
but john said that there were others .
his whole life &apos;s in here .
i &apos;ll go get the firewood .
i &apos;ll let you have a moment .
we &apos;re good to go .
you up for this ?
these people have done nothing but lie to you .
this girl that you &apos;ve known since birth ,
she &apos;s with the vampires now ,
the ones who killed mason .
they &apos;re the enemy ,
and if they break that curse , well ...
all of us are as good as dead .
are you up for this ?
yes .
good .
because if you wuss out , you &apos;re gonna have me to deal with ,
you got it ?
where &apos;s elena ?
at the lake house for the weekend .
with stefan ?
yes , with stefan .
and who gave her permission for that ?
i did . until you get a lawyer ,
file for guardianship , it &apos;s my call ,
and there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
i always knew you were lax with them ,
but i didn &apos;t think you were negligent .
she wanted to get away from you , ok ,
and so do i , so i &apos;ll be staying with rick .
because he &apos;s such a great guy , right ?
you are on dangerous ground .
he &apos;s a liar , jenna .
what ?
did he ever tell you
what happened to his wife ?
she died .
really ?
so they found her body ?
what are you saying ?
why don &apos;t you ask rick ?
i &apos;d love to hear his answer .
have a great night .
morning , sunshine .
i saw this movie once ,
some torture porn flick .
anyway , they had this collar device that was really cool ,
so i just modified it some with some wooden nails ,
and when i pull ...
so i hear you have the moonstone .
oh , if you only knew the irony of this moment right now .
let me tell you how this is gonna go .
you &apos;re gonna torture me , i don &apos;t talk ,
someone loses a heart .
last time , it was your boy mason .
this time , it will be you .
how long is this gonna take ?
i don &apos;t know . he &apos;s fighting me .
please stop . please .
there . all right .
why are you working with elijah ?
klaus .
we both want him dead .
you want to kill klaus , too . why ?
because he has her ,
and we have to get her away from him .
who--who are you talking about ?
my sister .
sister ?
why does he have her ?
he &apos;s searching for a way to undo the curse
without the doppelgger .
he &apos;s forced generations of witches
to help him for centuries .
what has elijah promised you ?
if we help elijah kill klaus ,
he &apos;s promised to return her to us .
and how do you kill klaus ?
how do you kill an original vampire ?
he &apos;ll kill me if i tell you .
don &apos;t make me .
it &apos;s ok , bonnie .
we can find another way .
no .
how will you kill klaus ?
after the sacrifice , klaus will be vulnerable , weak .
it &apos;s our only chance .
after the sacrifice ?
what do you mean , after ?
klaus will be vulnerable .
but elena will be dead .
yes .
elena has to die .
no .
keep him down .
if he moves ...
kill him .
don &apos;t move !
just let me get the bullet out
it punctured my heart .
i need to get it out . i &apos;m not gonna fight you .
i don &apos;t think so .
tyler , why are you doing this ?
i can &apos;t let you break the curse .
you know about the curse ?
you &apos;re liars , all of you .
no . i swear to you .
we don &apos;t want to break the curse , tyler .
we don &apos;t want to do that .
oh , yeah ?
but i do .
i can &apos;t be like this forever .
tyler , i &apos;m just trying to save elena .
elena will be fine !
they didn &apos;t tell you that part , did they ?
who are the liars now ?
tell me what ?
in order to break the curse ,
elena has to die .
are you growing the trees out there ?
stefan ?
stefan , what are you doing out there ?
i can smell you .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re ok .
you &apos;re ok .
you &apos;re all right . it &apos;s ok .
tyler ?
i didn &apos;t know what they were gonna do to you .
i didn &apos;t .
i just ...
i didn &apos;t want to be like this anymore .
i &apos;m sorry , elena .
it &apos;s ok .
you know what the great thing about buckshot is ?
it scatters through the body ,
maximum damage .
where &apos;s the moonstone ?
get over it , honey .
you &apos;re never gonna get it .
you looking for this ?
go ahead . take it .
what about you , sweetheart , hmm ?
you want to take a shot ?
no ? yes ? no ?
where &apos;s the girl ?
i don &apos;t know .
it doesn &apos;t really matter .
so you realize
this is the third time i &apos;ve saved your life now ?
so he planned to kill her all along .
yeah . the sacrifice is part
of elijah &apos;s plan .
got it loud and clear .
finally .
you missed all the fun .
there you are . are you ok ?
yeah , sorry . i--i--
i &apos;ve just been grading papers .
honestly , uh ...
i fell asleep . i &apos;m sorry .
jenna , i &apos;m a jerk .
no . it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m just glad you &apos;re ok .
sorry . tomorrow i &apos;m all yours , ok ?
sure . sounds great .
all right . good night , jenna .
good night .
it was straight from the witch &apos;s mouth .
he was gonna go through with the whole sacrifice .
you should probably just keep her away a little longer .
be careful . try not to get yourself killed .
yeah . it &apos;s been a day for that .
that was , um-- that was damon .
we need to talk .
what is it ?
he learned that elijah &apos;s planning for you to die
in the sacrifice ritual .
i know the deal i made , stefan .
elijah &apos;s very careful with his words .
he promised to protect my friends .
he never said a word about me .
you mean , you knew that you weren &apos;t gonna survive this ?
if it comes down to the people that i love getting killed or me ,
i know what my choice is gonna be .
elena , how--how could you stand out there earlier with me ,
talking about making plans for our future
when you don &apos;t even expect to have one .
i &apos;m sorry , stefan .
i &apos;m just trying to keep the people that i love safe .
i &apos;m trying to keep you safe .
no . what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re being a martyr .
how is that any different
from when you say that you would die to keep me safe ?
because i &apos;ve already lived .
162 years i have lived , and you &apos;ve barely begun ,
and now you want to let yourself get killed ?
that &apos;s not heroic . it &apos;s tragic .
so will luka remember anything ?
no .
he &apos;ll know he lost consciousness , that &apos;s all .
should we wait for caroline ?
she was just gonna drop luka back at the grill .
said to lock the door on our way out .
yeah . well , i hope she drops him hard .
wait .
you &apos;re elena &apos;s little brother ,
i &apos;ve known you forever .
you &apos;re that punk kid .
i remember your awkward phase
and then your emo phase ,
your druggie phase ,
and overnight ,
you turned into this hot guy who &apos;s really sweet and--
you think i &apos;m hot ?
with everything that &apos;s going on ,
you know , curses and sacrifice ...
enough already .
hello ?
hello ?
matt .
i &apos;m not in the mood , man .
i need to say something .
all right . say it .
i &apos;ve been going through a rough time ,
something i can &apos;t really talk about ,
and caroline &apos;s been helping me through it .
she &apos;s been there for me more than anyone &apos;s ever been there my entire life ,
and i kind of fell for her .
i don &apos;t know how anyone wouldn &apos;t because she &apos;s pretty incredible .
but she loves you , and she needs you ,
and to be honest , she deserves someone like you .
so you be good to her , ok ?
yeah , man . of course .
see you around , matt .
yeah .
mom ?
i &apos;m sorry about brady and your friends ,
but if i &apos;m gonna go with you ,
no more lies .
no more lies .
you &apos;re doing the right thing .
i can &apos;t stay here ,
