route 66
no , no .

儿童绑架
hey , it &apos;s me again .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not gonna make it .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll call you later .
i just put in new brakes .
she &apos;s running like a dream .
i always admired the aesthetic of the classic torpedo c body ,
especially in the 1947 .
they just don &apos;t make them like that anymore .
yeah , well , i &apos;m lucky to have found it .
uncle sal would be proud .
thank you for coming in , everyone . we can get started .
ok . guys , meet samantha wilcox ,
16 @-@ year @-@ old junior in wichita , kansas .
last night she snuck out with her boyfriend ,
they were attacked , she hasn &apos;t been seen since .
boyfriend got a broken jaw and a concussion .
and the description of the attacker
matches her father , eddie lee wilcox .
ex @-@ con .
oh , is he ever . still on parole .
eddie is a car thief and wheel man extraordinaire .
string of assault charges , too .
been in and out of jail since he was a kid .
we don &apos;t usually work parental abduction cases .
we do when the abduction &apos;s violent and dad &apos;s a former convict .
he hasn &apos;t been incarcerated in over 3 years .
i mean he &apos;s had ample opportunity .
why pick yesterday to kidnap her ?
well , he beat the boyfriend within an inch of his life to do it ,
so taking her had to be real important .
and apparently eddie was none too pleased
that samantha &apos;s mom melody had decided to remarry
and then move from chicago to wichita .
he lost visitation rights the last time he got locked up .
so the anger about that is the stressor
that builds up over the years .
last night he decides to do something about it .
this could be vengeance for taking his daughter away .
if it &apos;s revenge against the mother ,
he &apos;ll either hurt samantha or disappear with her .
she &apos;s been missing for over 5 hours ,
and we know how time sensitive these cases are .
the amber alert is expanding ?
every hour ...
excuse me .
hotch !
aaron !
mr. hotchner ?
mr. hotchner , can you hear me ?
pulse is thready .
he &apos;s not responding .
starting lactated ringers , wide open .
systolic &apos;s dropping . bp &apos;s 90 over 60 .
you stay with me , mr. hotchner . ok ?
stay with me .
bleeding internally from what ?
they think it &apos;s probably all the scar tissue .
torn adhesions from the stab wounds .
george foyet returns from the grave .
what &apos;s the prognosis ?
he &apos;s stable right now . did an ultrasound ,
but can &apos;t seem to see exactly where the bleeding was coming from .
he &apos;ll need an exploratory laparotomy .
does jack know ?
not yet . i talked to haley &apos;s sister jessica .
we didn &apos;t want to worry the little guy .
what about beth ?
i left a message , but she &apos;s on a business trip in milan .
look , i know you &apos;re all worried . so am i.
but a teenage girl has been abducted ,
and hotch would want us to focus on the case , not on him .
and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re gonna do .
now , when the plane lands , morgan , jj ,
i want you to interview samantha wilcox &apos;s mother .
reid , blake , you go check out the abduction site .
i &apos;m catching the the next flight to wichita
and i &apos;ll meet you there .
what about hotch ?
garcia &apos;s here . she &apos;s not going anywhere .
now , let &apos;s go find this girl .
breakfast .
come on , i know you &apos;re not sleeping .
what , are you gonna ignore me forever ?
i said i was sorry .
oh , come on , sammy .
don &apos;t call me that .
where are we ?
texas .
granola bar ?
can we stop and get a mcmuffin or something ?
maybe later when we stop for gas .
when &apos;s that ? i need coffee .
a couple of hours . you drink coffee now ?
yes . and i hate granola .
you gonna talk to me ?
i cannot believe you did that .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i lost my temper .
you just showed up . you should have called or something .
i didn &apos;t even have time to say goodbye to my friends .
how many times you want me to apologize ?
i am sorry .
but there &apos;s nothing i can do to change it now . ok ?
no ?
all right , then .
we had a deal .
you wanted out of wichita , here we are .
but you gotta lose the &apos; tude or we &apos;re never gonna make it .
angel , i swear ,
you are gonna love it down there .
ocean breezes .
sunny every day .
nowhere near wichita .
that &apos;s my girl .
he &apos;s just one of those guys , you know ?
he makes you feel special .
you think you can change him , but he never does .
were you aware of eddie &apos;s criminal background ?
he told me he was a mechanic .
i thought all those new cars were part of his job .
but after a while i noticed things .
like what ?
his sketchy friends .
sometimes he &apos;d be gone for days
and then suddenly he &apos;d have all this cash .
was he ever violent with you ?
he &apos;s got a bad temper .
what about with samantha ?
he wasn &apos;t around enough .
he got locked up when she was 6
and didn &apos;t get out until she was 13 .
after that i moved .
but i wasn &apos;t the one who told him .
sam was .
so they were in touch .
how often were they in contact ?
i don &apos;t know .
she doesn &apos;t tell me anything .
we fight all the time .
i--i thought it was because she &apos;s a teenager ,
but--
you can &apos;t blame yourself .
you did everything you could to try to keep her safe .
i did all that because i &apos;ve always been scared
she &apos;s too much like him .
get him into o.r. 2 right away .
yes , doctor .
hey , morgan .
how is he ?
he &apos;s still out . they &apos;re taking him to surgery now .
listen , we need those big old brains of yours
if you &apos;re ready .
born ready .
all right , we need you to check out
all of samantha wilcox &apos;s texts and email correspondence .
ok . what am i looking for ? anything in particular ?
she &apos;s been in touch with her dad on the d.l.
there might be something in there .
oh , and check vicap for any recent armed robberies
between wichita and eddie lee wilcox &apos;s
last known address in chicago .
why ?
well , according to samantha &apos;s mom ,
eddie may have been more than a car thief .
how much more ?
armed robber more .
he may be running from something work related .
got you . they just wheeled hotch into the surgery right now .
all right , keep us posted .
you know i will .
we should swing east and hit new orleans .
it &apos;s supposed to be awesome .
yeah , it &apos;s overrated .
come on , it &apos;ll be so much fun .
and i can help drive &apos; cause i &apos;m in drivers ed .
no time .
job starts in two days with or without me .
then how about padre island ?
it looks pretty and it &apos;s on the way .
what ?
nothin &apos; . i just can &apos;t believe how grown up you got .
i missed you , too .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
no , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t turn around and don &apos;t slouch .
just sit up and act normal .
i told you you shouldn &apos;t have beat him up so bad .
now you &apos;re probably wanted .
oh , my god , dad , what are you doing ?
relax . everything &apos;s gonna be ok .
what ? you were gonna shoot a cop ?
no . of course not .
glove box is the first place they check .
can i see it ?
you ever handle a gun ?
no .
then there &apos;s your answer .
this place is off the beaten path .
her mother said she snuck out late .
he must have followed her here from her house .
which suggests he may not have planned the abduction .
he just waited for the right opportunity .
look at this .
she left her cell phone behind .
odd for a teenage girl .
maybe she lost it in the struggle .
or it &apos;s a forensic countermeasure .
so they can &apos;t be tracked with the gps .
garcia got a hit on vicap .
the day before yesterday ,
two masked gunman robbed a pawn shop in chicago .
25k in cash and jewels were stolen .
the owner and a customer were shot dead .
and so was one of the gunmen ,
except he was shot 8 times with a .45 .
emptied the magazine . overkill ?
you think our guy &apos;s the shooter ?
the dead gunman was one christopher corbone .
he spent 6 years in the same cell block with eddie lee wilcox .
they were partners .
and corbone was heavily connected to the riggio family in chicago .
mid @-@ level mafioso thug .
sounds like a double @-@ cross .
if he double @-@ crossed his partner ,
he &apos;s not just on the run from the law ,
he could also be running from the mob .
that explains why the need to grab his daughter was so urgent .
with good guys and bad guys on his tail ,
he has to know that this doesn &apos;t end well .
it doesn &apos;t make sense . if he loves her so much ,
why put her in this type of jeopardy ?
his desperation &apos;s making him irrational .
he &apos;s gonna get dangerous if he gets cornered .
i can &apos;t tell for sure ,
but i &apos;m almost positive it &apos;s that fella on the news .
yes , sir . can you describe the vehicle he &apos;s driving ?
how much longer till we get there ?
uh , not long . a few more hours .
a few as in like 3 or like 7 ?
yeah . yeah , he sure is .
i need a shower . i stink .
it would have been nice if i could have packed a change of clothes .
i want you to take a walk to that diner up the road .
grab us some sandwiches , a couple slices of pie .
can &apos;t we just drive there when we get done ?
we shouldn &apos;t be seen together .
plus i gotta hit the head , number 2 .
it might take a while .
ok , ok . but way too much information .
what do you want ?
surprise me .
hey , the girl just went and walked off .
is he leaving with her ?
he looks like he &apos;s going around back to the bathroom .
all right , sir . you sit tight .
we have state patrol units en route to you . don &apos;t try any--
hello ?
hello ?
hey . hey , you there ?
hot the hell out there .
yeah , that time of year .
that comes to $ 6.00 even .
pulse is stable at 86 .
retractor , please .
is it true what i heard about this guy ?
yeah . serial killer almost stabbed him to death .
crazy , huh ?
let &apos;s have 4 units of o @-@ neg on hold .
正在上映 《 决定 决定 》
hi , honey .
i saved you a seat .
no news on hotch yet .
samantha wilcox was in touch with her dad a lot .
i got their texts right here .
may i ?
yeah .
thanks .
&quot; i hate my life . mom &apos;s a bitch .
hubby &apos;s a tool , and wichita blows .
why can &apos;t i live with you ? &quot;
then dad responds in kind ,
&quot; love you lots . we &apos;ll be together soon . &quot;
she wanted him to come get her .
yeah , what if they planned it ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not seeing anything
logistical in nature here .
it &apos;s all emotional outbursts at her mom .
and little loving missives to her dad .
i doubt if she had anything to do with this , though .
name &apos;s damon turner ,
54 @-@ year @-@ old widower , father of 3,
and apparently he was expecting is first grandchild .
no security cameras .
he had a shotgun stashed back there .
i wonder why he didn &apos;t use it .
eddie must have gotten the jump on him before he could .
guy recognizes eddie , calls 911 .
eddie clocks it , caps him to shut him up .
but the damage is already done .
he already made the call . why kill him ?
why didn &apos;t eddie just take off ?
he &apos;s in survival mode .
he &apos;ll try to eliminate any perceived threats .
he didn &apos;t rob the place .
he left all the cash in the register .
he didn &apos;t have to . he had money from the chicago robberies .
actually , i think he may have . look at this .
several items were rung up after the 911 call .
a bag of chips , a pack of gum , and 6 post cards .
post cards ? what does he want , a souvenir ?
it &apos;s possible . he knows if he gets caught ,
he &apos;s going away for a long time ,
and being with his daughter
may have evoke a need to commemorate the event .
but post cards are old school .
being with his daughter
might actually make him nostalgic in some way .
well , he &apos;s headed due south , most likely straight to mexico .
he &apos;ll stick to side roads
and won &apos;t cross the border anywhere busy .
i &apos;ll extend the amber alert
and have highway patrol set up roadblocks .
pulse is stable at 86 .
more suction , please .
yes , doctor .
you look so beautiful .
you &apos;re not so bad yourself .
i miss you .
i know .
ooh , it &apos;s starting .
oh , look how happy he is .
who &apos;s that ?
her name is beth .
he &apos;s gotten so big .
oh , she &apos;s really good with him .
she &apos;s not you .
and i &apos;m not enough .
oh , stop beating yourself up .
you &apos;re a great dad .
you always have been .
it gets hard .
and i &apos;m alone .
no , you &apos;re not .
jack misses you , too .
well , then you should talk about me more .
you should talk more , period .
he &apos;s not like you .
he needs to hear the words .
ohh ! go ! go .
go ! go !
goal !
as you all know ,
eddie lee wilcox is armed and dangerous .
he &apos;s also smart and criminally sophisticated .
he knows police procedure and how to use it .
he &apos;s flush with cash from his robbery in chicago ,
but he &apos;ll try to maintain a low profile ,
so he may resort to his robbery skills at some point .
eddie &apos;s a car thief and he &apos;s a good one .
so he &apos;ll switch vehicles often .
he was last seen in a chevy minivan ,
but we do not count on him being in it for long .
so canvass crowded parking lots and malls .
that &apos;s most likely where he &apos;ll ditch cars and find new ones .
we &apos;ve been calling this a child abduction ,
but eddie &apos;s daughter samantha
may actually be an unwitting participant .
we know she wanted to run away from home ,
and her father is somehow taking advantage of that .
this guy &apos;s evolved into a sociopathic spree killer ,
and he &apos;s got the ego of a career criminal ,
so there &apos;s no telling how far he &apos;ll go to save himself .
that ego may be feeding a sort of pipe dream ,
that if he does escape , he may actually
get to have a healthy relationship with his daughter .
a relationship he believes was taken from him .
but when reality sets in , his dream will be shattered ,
and that &apos;s when samantha will be in the most danger .
the majority of these cases
end in either murder / suicide or suicide by cop .
up to this point , we &apos;ve been reacting to him ,
but the roadblocks and the media blitz
are set up to make him react to us .
so if you spot him , call for backup
and proceed with extreme caution .
he &apos;s probably sleep deprived and irrational .
the closer we get , the more dangerous he becomes .
we have an amber alert for 16 @-@ year @-@ old
samantha renee wilcox of wichita .
samantha was allegedly abducted by her father , eddie lee wilcox ,
who is wanted in connection with a robbery in chicago
that claimed the lives of 3 victims .
sam ! what are you doing ? !
i was calling mom . they don &apos;t think that i ran away .
they think you kidnapped me .
no , no , no , no , no .
we talked about this . you can &apos;t call anybody .
i just wanted to let her know i was ok .
how long were you on the phone ?
is it true ?
did you tell her where we were ?
did you kill those people ?
what ?
i saw it on the news .
get dressed .
no , no , answer my question !
i &apos;ll tell you everything in the car , but we gotta go .
no , please , just tell me the truth .
now , sam ! now ! go !
this guy &apos;s not coming .
mm , we really haven &apos;t been here that long .
yeah , but if he wanted to make a run for the border ,
he &apos;d have been caught in the net by now .
maybe we made him switch directions .
well , we can &apos;t cover everything . texas is huge .
268,581 square miles , to be exact .
largest state in the contiguous 48
and the second @-@ most populous . don &apos;t mess with texas .
hey , you want to read ? i always do when i &apos;m anxious .
&quot; the magical mathematics of quantum physics . &quot;
i don &apos;t know . nope .
i &apos;m good . i &apos;ll wait for the movie .
here . put your hair up .
you said you would explain when we got in the car .
we &apos;re in the car . whoever &apos;s car this is .
i didn &apos;t do what they said that i did .
then what did you do ?
ah , jeez--i , uh--
my partner went crazy .
i was lucky to get out alive .
what happened ?
it all went down so quick and didn &apos;t have a choice ,
but i never should have trusted him .
did you kill anyone ?
sam--
did you kill anyone ? !
sam !
look ...
everything that i am doing
i am doing for us .
everything &apos;s gonna be ok when we get to mexico .
you just gotta trust me .
can you do that ?
yes .
that &apos;s my girl .
now please put the hat on , ok ?
break 1 @-@ 9 .
anybody with their ears on , we got 1043s .
on every boulevard due south .
smokeys are checkin &apos; brakes . be advised .
10 @-@ 4 , neighbor , thanks for the holler .
damn it !
what ?
change of plan .
thanks so much .
hey , what you got , good @-@ lookin &apos; ?
still nothing on hotch .
i have a sort of something on samantha wilcox .
she just called her mom
from a motel in odessa , but they weren &apos;t ...
that &apos;s only 103 miles west of here .
alert local pd . we &apos;re on our way .
wait , wait , wait . i already did that .
i called the police and
samantha and her dad are nowhere to be seen .
sorry , sugar .
he won &apos;t like the idea of her calling home .
that phone call will probably drive a wedge between the two of them .
we &apos;re close and he knows it .
maybe he &apos;ll make a mistake .
what are we doing ?
we need a new car .
sit tight .
ok .
what the hell you doin &apos; ? !
what do you think you &apos;re doin &apos; ? !
dad !
s @-@ sam !
sam !
sam !
get the bag .
get the bag . go !
get in the truck . you drive .
ok .
drive . go , go .
look at this .
it &apos;s messier than we thought .
bovie catheter .
yes , doctor .
whoa , pressure &apos;s dropping . 80 over 50 .
she &apos;s cute .
excuse me .
ah ... sorry .
ooh , ooh , pardon me .
i hope i didn &apos;t miss anything .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
oh , it &apos;s ok . i invited him .
she is hot .
isn &apos;t she ?
i would tear that up .
hey , i bet she &apos;s a real tiger in the sack , huh ?
ha ha ha ha ! ooh , popcorn ?
no .
would you like some ?
yes , thank you .
ah , he &apos;s in v @-@ fib .
pressure &apos;s still dropping .
get the paddles ready . charge to 150 .
charging to 150 .
clear .
haley !
no , no , no , no . i need more pressure .
somebody help me ! help me , please !
would you pipe down a little bit ?
haley , i &apos;m sorry . this is all my fault .
oh , my god . come on .
i can &apos;t stop the bleeding .
i can &apos;t stop the bleeding !
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re not supposed to .
she &apos;s right .
so can we watch the show ? thank you .
well , they left in a hurry .
owner says they were here less than an hour .
and none of the motel guests saw anything .
take a look at this robbery footage .
chicago pd apologized for the delay .
clearly not the first time they &apos;ve done this .
this the only angle we got ?
cameras inside weren &apos;t working .
muzzle flashes .
and they argue .
what about , though ?
shooting the people inside wasn &apos;t part of the plan .
this is where it gets good .
the gun jammed .
that explains the overkill .
he didn &apos;t double @-@ cross his partner ,
his partner double @-@ crossed him .
hey , girl . got you on speaker . what &apos;s up ?
hey , an unidentified male was just found shot and killed
at a truck stop parking lot outside of el paso .
sure that &apos;s our guy ?
well , a mustang was reported stolen
less than a mile from your current location .
it &apos;s in the same lot .
el paso . he &apos;s on the border .
he wouldn &apos;t cross there , though . it &apos;s too busy .
go back through his life again , garcia .
he &apos;s feeling the heat ,
so he &apos;s gonna default to something familiar .
the answer &apos;s in there somewhere .
done and done .
penelope . any word on hotch ?
still no news , but i &apos;m about to
rouse the nurses for some intel .
you go get &apos; em , girl .
sam , are you ok ?
i just keeping seeing that guy that you shot .
he probably would have killed me if i hadn &apos;t have done that .
then i &apos;d be on ice and you would be halfway home .
everything is gonna be ok , kiddo .
i promised i would always take care of you .
i meant it .
i will never leave you again .
ok .
ok .
my money says this guy caught eddie trying to steal his car .
there &apos;s a struggle , but eddie gets the upper hand ,
shoots him in the gut , and then drags him over there .
and he takes his wallet , not because he needs money
but so we can &apos;t i.d. him as quickly .
&apos;cause the minute we do , we know exactly
what kind of car they &apos;re driving .
hey , break it down , baby girl .
ok , here we go .
eddie &apos;s story is way more tragic than we thought .
we know his mom died in childbirth and his dad committed suicide .
what we didn &apos;t know was that he &apos;s the one
who found his father &apos;s dead body .
he was only 5 .
yeah . the postman called
the cops when he smelled something horrible .
turns out that little kindergarten @-@ sized eddie
was in the house with the corpse for two days ,
and it was in the middle of a crazy heat wave , so ...
wait a minute , garcia .
eddie &apos;s father died february 2 .
correctamundo .
the average temperature in
chicago in february is 26 degrees fahrenheit .
oh , no , they weren &apos;t in chicago .
the were in los angeles because his father had a job opportunity
that fell through , which he apologized for in his suicide note
that he wrote on a stack of post cards .
are you sure they drove ?
yeah . because the post cards were from stops
they made along the way .
i think i know where they might be headed .
i can &apos;t get his pressure up .
it &apos;s 80 over 40 .
one more mg. of epi and we need that o @-@ neg .
haley , i &apos;m sorry . this is all my fault .
that was awesome .
well , it &apos;s time to go .
i gotta go take a leak .
i &apos;ll meet you guys in the lobby , all right ?
ok .
well , this was fun .
i don &apos;t want you to go .
what about jack ?
and beth ? they need you now more than ever .
just a little while longer ?
there &apos;s no time .
please ?
you have to go back now .
i want to stay with you .
i know you &apos;re the big boss man ,
but you can &apos;t always have your way , you know .
sometimes you just have to roll with it .
i don &apos;t know how .
happiness is a choice .
so choose .
but how ?
how do i choose ?
get out of your head .
the heart is the one that knows ,
so follow it .
nice car .
hey , what gives ? i thought were were gonna meet in the lobby .
oh , anybody gonna catch the subway downtown ?
i hear it &apos;s gonna be a hot one .
no ?
all right , then .
hey . this was great .
we gotta do this again .
come here , big guy .
take care of yourself , all right ?
jeez louise , loosen up a little bit .
would it kill you to smile ?
seriously .
beth &apos;s a keeper .
and jack really likes her .
so don &apos;t screw it up .
goodbye , aaron .
and , yes ,
i still love you , too .
sam .
wake up .
sam .
check it out .
it looks just like it did when my dad took me here when i was a kid .
it &apos;s beautiful .
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
hang on .
get out of the car , sam . get out of the car .
get out of the car ! here .
what are you doing ? !
stay back !
dad , you &apos;re crazy !
get back !
i &apos;ll shoot ! stay back !
i &apos;ll blow her brains out ! i swear to god !
stay back !
stop it !
go ! go ! go !
i said get back ! i &apos;ll shoot !
get back or i &apos;ll shoot her !
hi , sir .
welcome back .
do you feel ok ? do you need anything ?
what happened ?
uh , you collapsed and they performed emergency surgery
because you were bleeding internally .
the doctor said it had something to do with the stabbing .
but you &apos;re fine . there were some complications
with the operation , but you &apos;re--you &apos;re ok .
i mean , you &apos;re like as healthy as a puma ,
a bedridden puma . but my point is you &apos;re gonna be fine .
where &apos;s jack ?
he &apos;s at home with jessica . shall i send for him ?
please . and i need my phone .
thank you .
i need to call beth .
ok . uh , so i &apos;m gonna ...
call jessica and let the team know you &apos;re ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s ok .
sir , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just--i &apos;m-- i &apos;m really happy you &apos;re back .
you had us worried sick .
garcia ...
thank you for staying .
wild horses , sir .
just wild horses .
i &apos;m so sorry , i &apos;m so sorry .
i would never-- i would never hurt you .
why did you do that ?
i &apos;m so sorry . i did not mean to scare you .
you said you were gonna blow my brains out !
i just needed some time to think , baby .
i just needed-- i needed a little time .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
eddie lee wilcox , this is the fbi .
we can work this out , but you have to let samantha go .
come on , she &apos;s your daughter .
do the right thing , eddie .
has he said anything yet ?
not a word .
statistically speaking , the longer this takes
the worse his daughter &apos;s chances get .
i don &apos;t know . if he was gonna do something to her ,
