gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i would like to cordially invite you to join
this summer &apos;s group of artists in residence
at the italian arts and letters institute in rome .
i would never stand in the way of an opportunity like that .
you have to take it .
you didn &apos;t hear her--or chuck .
it was--it was like she wanted me to leave
so she could just spend all summer with him .
i &apos;m saying no .
why ?
i can work anywhere .
i don &apos;t think my relationship can .
it &apos;s over . and unless you want the whole world to know
you run a high @-@ class prostitute ring ,
you &apos;re gonna walk away from &quot; the spectator &quot; forever .
my computer &apos;s gone .
gossip girl . she took it .
how do you know that ?
because we set you up .
the old gossip girl hurt people ,
but i &apos;m different .
no , you &apos;re not , serena .
either way , it &apos;s over .
the real gossip girl is back .
whatever you saw
or you think you saw ,
you can &apos;t tell chuck .
he has a right to know .
do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out ?
whatever it is , you can tell me , blair .
you need to go back into that house .
dad .
oh , my god .
so the car accident was real .
i was lucky to survive it .
but it wasn &apos;t an accident .
i &apos;d been threatened .
by who ?
very powerful competitor of mine .
i had information on some transactions of his
that could &apos;ve put him away for a very long time .
when his threats didn &apos;t work ...
you had someone ram your limo with a truck ?
dad , you could &apos;ve gone to the police . you didn &apos;t have to--
yes , i did .
he &apos;d made it quite clear
that both you and lily were fair game .
once i realized his threats weren &apos;t empty ,
the only way out
was to make him believe he &apos;d already won .
once i got to the hospital that night ,
i thought that would be my best chance .
so , what , you just ...
paid some doctor to switch off the machines ,
and hope lily was crying so much ,
she wouldn &apos;t notice you were actually still breathing ?
what did we bury in that coffin ?
charles ...
i am here with you now , trying to explain .
你还好吗
humphrey residence . blair waldorf speaking .
oh , hi , alessandra .
no , he &apos;s in the shower . can i take a message ?
mm @-@ hmm . got it .
yeah , no , don &apos;t worry . i will tell him
the second i see him .
that was your agent .
she wants you to reconsider the program in rome ,
which is odd because you told me
they went with someone else .
uh , well , yesterday , when you ended up with chuck ,
i was a little nervous
about leaving for the whole summer .
and i know you told me there &apos;s other people there ,
it &apos;s not romantic , but ...
come on . it &apos;s chuck .
so you lied to me ?
uh , i @-@ i figured you would think i was
just some jealous freak if i told the truth .
well , maybe because you are .
but you don &apos;t have to be .
you have nothing to worry about .
take the offer . it &apos;s an amazing opportunity ,
and i would never stand in the way of it .
it means the entire summer apart .
but it &apos;s not like i can &apos;t come visit .
rome is just two glasses of chardonnay away .
call her back . it &apos;s not too late to change your mind .
i assure you , there &apos;s no need to worry .
the police were never there .
the entire thing was a false alarm .
your wife will not find out .
and if you are indeed headed for a third divorce ,
it will not be due to this .
nope , no bother at all . cheers .
i want you out of here today .
after all the fun we &apos;ve had together ?
what would people think
if they knew about your side business ?
is that a threat ?
because i am your main financial backer ,
and we did sleep together--
sometimes right here in these offices .
so exposing me would only embarrass &quot; the spectator &quot;
and you .
then i &apos;ll find another way .
you &apos;ve done nothing but spread lies and cause trouble
since you arrived .
i wanna actually build something here ,
and i can &apos;t do that with you around .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve gone through
to legitimize myself .
i &apos;ve worked hard for this paper ,
and i &apos;m not about to step aside .
and as for my other business ,
i &apos;m really more of a figurehead now .
darling , don &apos;t look so disturbed .
there are far worse things
than being stuck with the likes of me .
guess what i found out this morning .
b. , i know what you &apos;re gonna say ,
but first , i really wanna tell you--
dan turned down the opportunity to spend the summer
in rome with the world &apos;s literary luminaries .
and do you know why ?
because he &apos;s scared of leaving me here with chuck .
can you believe it ?
sort of .
i mean , the most important thing in a relationship is trust .
after sex . and hygiene .
and earning potential .
wait . w @-@ what did you think i was going to say ?
oh , n--i mean , no , it &apos;s not important .
nowhere near as important as dan and italy
and his trust issues .
we should go get coffee , and you should tell me more about it .
wait . okay .
using a very generous grading curve
and rounding up because i like your outfit ,
that lie was a c @-@ plus at best .
what is going on ?
it &apos;s something i &apos;ve been wanting to talk to you about
for a while now .
i &apos;ve been posting on &quot; gossip girl &quot;
as gossip girl ...
for a couple of months now .
what ? how is that possible ?
when georgina left town , she gave me her laptop ,
and it had a direct link to the &quot; gossip girl &quot; server ,
passwords , the software , everything .
s. , you had me at &quot; georgina . &quot;
but i can &apos;t believe it . w @-@ why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i don &apos;t know . i felt like it was something
i had to keep secret from everyone .
i mean , my best friend , even .
i @-@ i know it was wrong , and i &apos;m so sorry .
i mean , i could &apos;ve helped .
sealing fates , forging destinies ...
like an imperious greek goddess ,
imposing her will on the guileless masses .
but i was wondering
why gossip girl was being so nice to me lately .
and a little off her game . no offense .
wait , so--so you &apos;re not mad ?
i am furious with you ...
for not sharing your good fortune and omnipotence .
but ... right now i have to go replace my mother &apos;s la mer
before she returns from paris
and discovers that i &apos;ve used it all .
wait . let me do that for you-- my first act of contrition .
please .
you think i &apos;m cashing in your &quot; gossip girl &quot; guilt chip
on some overpriced eye cream ?
i &apos;ll think of something more useful .
it &apos;s not like i planned any of it .
i needed help ,
so i contacted an old friend .
diana payne .
in her line of work , she has a network
of influential contacts throughout the world .
she utilized them to keep me safe and hidden .
she also kept me informed .
when you needed blood , we had to act fast .
she snuck me back into the country
so i could provide it for you .
thank you for that .
there &apos;s just so much i wanna know .
i guess now we have time . you can tell me everything .
unfortunately , i &apos;m afraid our time is up .
if the man i &apos;m hiding from were to discover i was still alive ,
he &apos;d try and kill me again .
or go after you .
let &apos;s go after him .
all you need to know
is that as long as i &apos;m still around , we &apos;re all in danger .
i was supposed to leave last night ,
but my departure was delayed
because of the commotion you and your friends caused .
it was wonderful to get to see you again .
it &apos;s something i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d ever be able to do .
but i &apos;m afraid you have to go now .
what ... what is this ?
you &apos;re kicking me out ?
and then what ?
you go and you disappear ?
leave me alone again ?
it &apos;s for your own safety .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you for meeting me .
what can i do for you , chuck ?
i just found out from an extremely reliable source
someone else was after my father right before his death .
i want to know who it was .
that was years ago .
why would a source come to you now ?
just look into it .
i &apos;ll triple your usual fee if you can get me a name by noon .
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t help you with this .
not only am i on assignment , but frankly ,
this seems like a waste of both our time .
if you won &apos;t help me , i &apos;ll find someone who can .
sometimes , looking for answers
only leads to more questions .
serena , hey . is blair up there ?
no , she had to run an errand .
i just , uh , i have some news i wanna surprise her with .
and sometimes , you &apos;re better off not knowing .
chuck ? i can &apos;t really be seen with you right now .
but how are you doing ?
are you okay ?
far from it .
i have to find a way to stop my father from leaving tonight .
leaving ? but you just found him .
he left to keep me safe . now it &apos;s my turn to save him .
is there anywhere you have to be right now ?
but the best way to avoid giving an answer
is to avoid the question altogether .
is my mother back ? did she notice the eye cream already ?
no , it &apos;s actually dan .
he &apos;s waiting here with big news to surprise you with .
i &apos;m with chuck .
b.
no , it &apos;s not like that .
he needs me .
he &apos;s going through an extremely difficult time right now .
yeah , of course he is , especially if it means
taking you away from dan to be with him .
and you just told me dan is having trust issues .
i know , but this is life or death .
and other than not being able to say where i am ,
what i &apos;m doing , or who i &apos;m waiting for ,
i honestly have nothing to hide .
well , dan needs you , too ,
and you can &apos;t be two places at once .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll be right there .
whatever news he has , i &apos;m sure it won &apos;t take too long to relay .
chuck ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i want to stay , but something came up .
do you mind if i ...
diana will see you now .
i can handle this part on my own .
thanks for waiting with me .
i don &apos;t suppose you came here to thank me .
thank you for what ?
not telling me my father was alive ,
pretending to be my mother , or screwing my best friend ?
you mean for keeping your father alive ,
pretending to be your mother to protect him ,
and ... well , i don &apos;t expect you to thank me for nate .
perhaps i should thank you for that one .
look , i &apos;m not here to hug it out
or bond over my father &apos;s resurrection .
i just need your help in keeping him here .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not possible .
i think it is .
you &apos;ve been helping him hide . i think you know who from .
who tried to kill my father ?
i know it was one of his competitors ,
someone powerful enough to scare him into hiding
these last few years .
i just want a name .
does your father know you &apos;re here ?
if you really wanna help him ,
help me put an end to this .
if i do agree-- and only if--
you can never say who told you .
and ...
i &apos;ll need something else from you .
it &apos;s not a small request .
the price is no concern .
i need this to happen as fast as possible .
make them an offer they can &apos;t say no to ,
and offer them more .
make this happen now .
hungry ?
thirsty .
blair asked me to come check on you . everything okay ?
blair asked you to do that ?
oh , i owe her a favor or 12 .
i don &apos;t need a babysitter .
besides ...
he already has one .
i am so sorry ! serena told me you were waiting .
i had to go to five different stores
to find the right eye cream .
no , don &apos;t worry about it .
i was just catching up on some reading ,
which is actually for you .
a rome travel guide ?
yeah , i talked to alessandra ,
who talked to the people at the program ,
and they said i can still go to rome if i want .
but the best part is , you can come with me .
wow . all summer ?
yeah . we would have to meet with an alumnus from the program
since the chairwoman is already on her way back to italy .
you know , i mean , it &apos;s a small group ,
so they have to vet everyone &apos;s plus @-@ one .
of course . it sounds reasonable .
only thing is , the interview would have to be today
since it &apos;s so last @-@ minute .
so what do you think ? huh , spend the summer with me in italy ?
what is she doing here ?
has she come to you for help ?
nathaniel , can i speak with you privately ?
just a moment , please .
take your time .
you still want her out , right ?
yes . lola and i are coming up with a plan .
there &apos;s no need to scheme . i &apos;ve taken care of it .
there &apos;s a paper in london which is in need of a face @-@ lift .
i &apos;ve arranged for diana to take it over
at a bargain basement price .
wait . she didn &apos;t want to leave .
what else did you promise her ?
that you wouldn &apos;t expose her previous profession .
let her leave with her reputation still in tact .
so she gets everything she wants ?
where &apos;s the justice in that ?
there &apos;s justice in getting what we want
you wanted diana out . i got her out .
and it &apos;s good business for me .
now all i need to do is finalize the deal .
hey , b. , diana &apos;s here and so is nate .
it &apos;s super tense . you have to tell me what &apos;s going on .
i can &apos;t , s. i &apos;m sorry .
but text me what chuck &apos;s mood
is like when they leave .
that way , i &apos;ll know if i &apos;m needed .
what--what was dan &apos;s big surprise ?
it was more of an ambush .
he got into this writing program in rome ,
and he wants me to go with him the whole summer .
oh , how dare he !
blair , that &apos;s amazing .
i told him i had to check my calendar
to buy some time to think .
oh , what &apos;s there to think about ?
rome for the summer sounds like a dream .
well , not for romans .
the whole place will be crawling with americans .
and you can be two of them .
but it &apos;s a big decision ,
and after spending last summer at louis &apos; side ,
i was hoping to do my own thing .
so your indecision has nothing to do with chuck ?
absolutely not .
my concern for him at this time
is about something entirely unrelated .
which you can &apos;t tell me about .
b. , i hate being out of the loop . come on !
it &apos;s simply not up to me to tell . sorry .
but text me with updates as to how he &apos;s doing .
so is she taking the offer ?
getting everything she wants .
she &apos;s done nothing but lie to us .
now she &apos;s being rewarded for it .
well , at least she &apos;ll be gone soon .
yeah . we should probably warn london .
i mean , she &apos;s gonna be playing the exact same games over there ,
and there &apos;s not a thing we can do to stop her .
maybe we can .
chuck agreed that you wouldn &apos;t out diana &apos;s secret .
but he didn &apos;t say anything about me .
so ... what &apos;s the verdict ?
i &apos;m in .
great !
i &apos;ll call the liaison with the program
to see when he can come over .
after all your father &apos;s done to protect you ,
i would hate to see this end in tragedy .
are you sure you want to know who tried to kill him ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
and we have a deal .
all right , then .
mason nevins .
one of your father &apos;s fiercest competitors
with known ties to organized crime ...
and a liking for twins .
i don &apos;t care about his sex life .
ah , but you should .
he &apos;s quite the family man ,
demands the utmost discretion .
now i &apos;m scheduled for two of my girls to pay him a visit .
if someone were to catch him in the act ,
that someone would have
extremely valuable blackmail material .
if your father knew , i doubt he &apos;d approve .
which is why not telling him is part of the deal .
right .
standing appointment .
the james hotel , skyline suite . 4 : 00 p.m.
he &apos;s gonna come alone .
he doesn &apos;t want anyone to know about this .
and that includes his henchmen .
pleasure doing business with you .
mm , that &apos;s odd .
it &apos;s my friend from the &quot; times . &quot;
she can &apos;t possibly know about our little deal yet--
unless my phone is tapped ,
which i wouldn &apos;t put past her .
hang on .
marlene , darling . how are you ?
you don &apos;t say . an anonymous tip ?
yes , i suppose that would be quite the scandal ,
if it were true , but ... hang on .
the deal is off ,
and you can forget about using my girls .
marlene , you can &apos;t say a word of this to anybody ...
they say the truth will set you free ,
but some truth comes at a price .
what have you done ?
okay , someone has to tell me what &apos;s going on here .
we couldn &apos;t let her get away without any consequences .
she &apos;s done nothing but deceive all of us , including you .
it just wasn &apos;t right .
yeah , we &apos;re sorry we messed up your deal ,
but this was beyond business . it was personal .
you have no idea how personal .
i made that deal with her
so she would help get my father out of hiding .
wait . your father-- you mean jack ?
bart. he &apos;s alive .
the bone , dorota ? really ?
our guest is italian .
i don &apos;t think that beige plates are very la dolce vita .
you don &apos;t think this is-- this is too much ?
and it &apos;s just an interview with one person .
well , we want to impress him , right ?
i think they &apos;re just trying to make sure
we &apos;re a sane , stable couple .
i @-@ i guess they &apos;ve had some trouble in the past .
apparently , padma lakshmi and salman rushdie
broke up during their stay ...
and it caused all kinds of drama .
有办法对付戴安娜吗
you know what ? you &apos;re right . this is all wrong .
yeah , it &apos;s a little overboard .
no , it &apos;s not enough .
we don &apos;t want pastries . we want gelato .
what ? whoa , whoa , whoa .
but it &apos;s important for us to show
how much we love italian culture ,
and what says that better than gelato ?
i go get gelato , miss blair .
no . it &apos;s okay . i will do it , dorota .
you never get the right flavors anyway .
no one likes pistachio anything .
but , you know , we have an hour .
i &apos;ll be back in plenty of time , i promise .
so all these years ,
he never made any attempt to contact you ?
or my mom ?
too risky .
if my memory serves me right ,
lily was in the process of leaving him for rufus .
he only came out of hiding to save me after the accident .
i was hoping to return the favor ,
but your little girlfriend ruined that plan
when she exposed diana .
i hope she feels justice has been served
because she cost me my father .
hey , ease up . she didn &apos;t know about bart. none of us did .
well , is there anything we can do to help ?
i &apos;m not sure .
once this guy shows up , and diana &apos;s girls aren &apos;t there ,
he &apos;s gonna know something isn &apos;t right .
i need to come up with a new plan fast .
you don &apos;t need a new plan . you just need new girls .
and since you have a juilliard actress at your disposal ,
and one who wants to fix what she broke ...
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love the chance to make things right .
wonderful .
just tell her it &apos;s a non @-@ union job .
while we rehearse , you go after diana
and make sure she doesn &apos;t cancel her client &apos;s appointment .
we don &apos;t want to put on a show to an empty house .
hurry . we only have an hour .
you &apos;re gonna need every minute i can spare .
bart , it &apos;s diana .
start getting ready .
you &apos;re leaving earlier than scheduled ,
and i &apos;m coming with you .
oh , and i hope you &apos;ve got that check for me .
马上就要走了
where is she ? we have to get going .
you said you needed twins , right ?
or at least two blondes around the same height .
ivy owes me .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes to help .
i &apos;d love to get back in the gang .
but ... just to clarify ,
in order to be &quot; back in the gang , &quot;
you would &apos;ve had to be in the gang to begin with .
we don &apos;t need ivy . i can do it .
after all , b. , you have that thing you need to get to .
actually , i have a different acting job for you--
a part you know better than anyone .
mr. daniel humphrey , this mr. emilio pivano .
thank you for coming on--on such short notice .
it &apos;s a pleasure to meet
an esteemed alumnus of the program .
i read your book . not a bad debut .
easy to see the potential .
thank you .
how many people were you expecting ?
only you .
uh , that &apos;s just my girlfriend blair .
she loves variety and themes . in fact , funny story--
um , being that the program is in rome ,
she wanted us to have gelato ,
so she--she went out to get some since we didn &apos;t have any here .
knowing , uh , miss blair , she go to chelsea market
for best gelato in city .
and , i mean , what--what says &quot; italy &quot; better than , uh , gelato ?
sh @-@ she &apos;ll--she &apos;ll be-- she &apos;ll be back in just a moment .
sorry i &apos;m late .
i got stuck in traffic .
babe , i &apos;m sorry . hi . i &apos;m blair waldorf .
so nice to meet you .
looks like s. is b.s.ing as b.
let &apos;s hope this works .
there &apos;s no place like rome .
where is the gelato ?
i actually didn &apos;t even like him at first .
i thought that he was annoying and
unpopular and from brooklyn .
and i would , uh , antagonize him on a daily basis .
we--we really couldn &apos;t stand each other for years .
but it &apos;s like a movie now , you know ,
because we &apos;re just madly in love .
mm , n @-@ not--not that madly .
it &apos;s a--it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a calm , stable love .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re very secure in it . we don &apos;t have to worry about it .
yeah , yeah , it &apos;s like we were meant to be .
like brad and angelina once they got rid of jennifer .
yeah , i mean , not that dramatic .
obviously , there was no jennifer .
you &apos;ll have to excuse blair .
she &apos;s not really feeling herself today .
you know , the point is ,
if dan is in rome , i wanna be in rome .
that sounds wonderful .
you two make an ... interesting couple .
uh , excuse me one moment . i have to take this call .
where the hell is blair ?
if she didn &apos;t want to come to rome with me ,
she should &apos;ve just said so .
something came up .
is she with chuck ?
no . of course not . she &apos;s with eleanor .
but she knows how important this is to you ,
and she wants to go , so she sent me in her place .
well , you &apos;re not really helping .
he just said we make an interesting couple .
not in a good way .
i cannot believe that blair would do this .
what could be more important ?
i handpicked these myself .
you really want us to wear one of those ?
if it helps to get into character .
or you can have him choose your outfits
and stay clothed for now .
okay . when nevins shows up , take charge immediately .
remember , you are pros .
you call the shots .
what if he wants to touch us ?
swat his hand away and tell him &quot; no . &quot;
treat him like the dog he is .
how do you know this will work ?
you think this is the first time
i &apos;ve entrapped someone with prostitutes ?
every good girl has a pair .
now when the time is right ,
chuck will burst in and take pictures ,
and then your work here is done .
oh . and if you get his clothes off
before you cuff him to the bed ,
it &apos;ll make things a lot easier .
what are you doing here ?
came to say a proper good @-@ bye .
sorry . short on time .
besides , what about your girlfriend ?
that &apos;s not what i meant .
your friend from the &quot; times &quot; is on her way here now .
she seems interested in hearing what i have to say .
why would she believe you ?
i made a copy of your day planner .
i can explain the code .
you don &apos;t understand . i have to reach bart.
as if you care about anyone but yourself .
nate
i made several bad choices early on in life .
but i wanted to escape that world and start fresh .
&quot; the spectator &quot; is my shot at doing that ,
and ... being here with you
it &apos;s the happiest i &apos;ve ever been .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you lied to me from the moment we randomly met in los angeles ,
and you &apos;re lying to me now .
i never lied about my feelings to you .
i think in your heart you know that .
nate , i can &apos;t go back to my old life ,
and i stand no choice of starting a new one
with my name in the headlines .
must you keep me here to humiliate me on top of all that ?
i apologize for cutting this short ,
but i think we &apos;ve covered everything .
um , thank you for coming by .
i &apos;m sorry if we wasted your time .
not your fault . lucia insisted we do this .
but i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll both have a nice time in rome .
just watch out for pickpockets .
che bastardi .
wait a second . i &apos;m sorry .
are you--are you saying that , uh , we got in ?
of course . this was just a formality ,
and if i didn &apos;t have a deadline to meet for my new novel ,
i would love to sit around and chat more with you guys .
you really do make a lovely couple .
a lot of energy , that one .
hello .
i &apos;m eleanor waldorf .
oh . you have a lovely daughter .
i can see where she gets her beauty from .
okay , thank you so much for coming ,
but don &apos;t forget that deadline , buddy .
serena , how are you ?
hello ! i am good . thank you .
uh , wh @-@ where &apos;s blair ?
i haven &apos;t seen her yet . excuse me .
so what if we , like , lay down on the bed
in a ... in a sexy pose ?
yeah . but i don &apos;t know .
maybe we could just , like , stand here and look sexy .
when we were doing all those crazy exercises in acting class ,
who would have thought that we &apos;d end up here ?
holding an imaginary orange in our hands .
oh , god . he &apos;s here .
break a leg .
whatever .
are you diana &apos;s girls ?
strip down to your underwear and get on the bed .
you don &apos;t understand .
we heard you like it rough .
what do you want your safe word to be ?
i am not the client .
chuck sent me . you &apos;re in danger ,
and so is bart. nevins got wise to your plan .
chuck &apos;s on his way to see bart now ,
and we &apos;re supposed to regroup there .
he said that you would know the way .
i do , yeah .
well , good , &apos; cause we really need to go . come on .
chuck .
chuck !
i wish you would have told me earlier
you were having your p.i. take the pictures .
i told the girls it &apos;s you would be doing it .
i am . what are you talking about ?
andrew tyler .
i saw him get into an elevator as i came down .
you didn &apos;t send him ?
i didn &apos;t send andrew anywhere .
lola ? ivy ?
where could they have gone ?
uh @-@ oh , chuck . you might need to have
your private investigator investigated .
so i &apos;m a little confused .
first , blair says she &apos;s running out to get gelato ,
and then you say she &apos;s with eleanor ,
and then eleanor says she hasn &apos;t seen blair all day .
so where &apos;s blair ?
she &apos;s with chuck .
i knew it .
i know it &apos;s hard , dan , but you &apos;re gonna have to trust her .
how am i supposed to trust her around chuck
when i know she doesn &apos;t love me ?
i mean , that &apos;s the real reason she doesn &apos;t wanna come away with me .
i &apos;m sorry . that &apos;s--i @-@ i should talk about this to someone else .
no , i @-@ i can handle it .
i told blair i loved her , and she didn &apos;t say it back .
oh , dan , you know how many times she &apos;s been burned by that word .
first , chuck took a year to say it ,
and then louis said it too soon .
i know how much she cares about you .
she may not have said it then , but she will .
even if that is true , that doesn &apos;t change the fact
that she lied to me .
this lie is different .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s life or death .
come on . i know you upper east siders
are partial to hyperbole , but it &apos;s--
not this time .
bart bass is alive .
what ?
chuck ? bart ?
hello ?
well , this is the room he was in yesterday .
maybe he changed rooms . you stay here . we &apos;ll go check .
how about i come with you-- for protection ?
oh , wait . here he comes .
what the ...
surprised to see me ?
until you found out i was still alive .
leave us .
you were the last person i saw before the accident .
you got out of the car right before it happened .
when blair told me she saw you at the hotel earlier ,
i started thinking .
it wasn &apos;t a competitor that tried to kill him .
it was you .
you hired me to gather intel on nevins , and i did .
a lot of it .
but he found out , and he threatened me and my family .
it was either you or them , so i turned .
told him i &apos;d work for him .
and to prove my loyalty , i helped get you out of the way .
i told &apos; em where you &apos;d be-- in the car ,
and they told me when to get out .
did you get all that ?
every word .
officers ?
i guess now the police know the truth .
you &apos;ll be sticking around .
when you care about someone , you want them to stay .
come in .
someone from the &quot; times &quot; is here .
yeah , tell her diana &apos;s already gone ,
and she took her book day planner with her .
but sometimes , showing you care means letting them go .
hi .
hey . how &apos;d everything go ?
pretty great , considering .
bart bass is alive and safe .
chuck stayed up there with him .
they &apos;re talking to the police .
and ivy and lola ?
you would have been proud , if you liked either of them .
but if lola hadn &apos;t texted where they were going ,
we might not have ever beat them up there .
well , maybe i should give her some more credit .
well , thanks for covering for me with dan .
i called him on the way back . he said we &apos;re going to italy .
well , that &apos;s great news , isn &apos;t it ?
of course . i ...
i just hope they &apos;re not disappointed
with the real blair waldorf when they meet her .
oh , they never could be .
but you should probably know you volunteered
to teach english at a local school while you &apos;re there .
well , i guess i can &apos;t spend all my time
shopping on the via condotti .
you could only stare up at the sistine chapel for so long .
thanks , s.
you really are my best friend .
hmm . i love you , b.
i love you , too .
speaking of which ,
maybe it &apos;s time to tell dan how you feel about him ?
he told you about that ?
i &apos;m not ready .
i really want the next person i say it to , to be the last .
you &apos;re packing to come home , right ?
right .
now that we have tyler &apos;s confession , we can get nevins .
and i can show my face again .
i wanna thank you , son .
i didn &apos;t think this was gonna be possible ,
but the way you took control , got me out of this mess ,
makes me think i did something right in raising you .
i think we both know you didn &apos;t raise me .
you were too busy with
all those inappropriate transient women
to teach me any viable life lessons ...
except those about inappropriate transient women .
i will have to lay low ,
hire security .
we &apos;ll take care of it together , like a family .
speaking of which , what about lily ?
have you thought about
how you wanna break the news to her ?
i &apos;m not sure .
my relationship with lily was on the rocks .
you and i were going through a difficult time .
maybe hiding all these years
was easier than facing things head @-@ on .
well ...
how about we try group therapy next time instead ?
so how did diana get away ?
what did she do , go out the window ?
wouldn &apos;t put it past her .
but whatever happened , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll see her again .
oh , good . then i get your full attention . yeah .
blair , it &apos;s three months .
we can &apos;t--we can &apos;t spend the entire summer
living at the hotel de russie .
well , of course not .
we also have to stay at the portrait suites ,
which is right above ferragamo .
of course . that may be more for me .
do you really wanna spend
the entire summer with me in rome ?
chuck &apos;s dad is alive .
that is gonna change his world deeply .
his , yes , but not mine .
i understand why you did what you did today ,
but i need to know , for me , for us ...
what is really happening here ?
there is nothing i want more
than to spend the summer right by your side .
where are you going ?
i just realized that somebody should probably break the news
about bart to my dad .
well , then i will start researching restaurants .
we have 3 months . that &apos;s 90 days ,
which is 270 meals .
i may need to create a spreadsheet .
you want camomile tea before bed , miss serena ?
i just make for miss eleanor , catch up on all the gossip ,
watch &quot; toddlers &amp; tiaras . &quot;
please , no more tiaras of any kind .
you have smile in eyes .
it &apos;s so nice to see you away from that computer .
yeah , the computer &apos;s gone ,
and i finally feel like i &apos;m getting my life back ,
and my friends back , too . feels good .
oh . it &apos;s probably blair now .
evening , upper east siders .
many of you have complained i &apos;ve been too kind
to s and b these last few months .
but all of that &apos;s about to change ...
because i &apos;ve got a page from blair waldorf &apos;s diary ,
where she tells all about who &apos;s really in her heart .
and there &apos;s lots more where that came from ,
courtesy of her b.f.f. , s.v.d.w.
