my name is elena gilbert .
i &apos;m a vampire in search of the cure .
it &apos;s a cure for immortality ?
you dig up silas , and you &apos;ve got your cure .
there is only one dose .
i really want to get that cure for you .
if i gave you the cure to save yourself ,
you &apos;d give it to elena , wouldn &apos;t you ?
we all wanted it .
help elena get the damn thing ...
we risked everything to get it .
she &apos;s here .
katherine .
it &apos;s been too long , little gilbert .
and we failed .
jeremy ! oh , no . no . no .
oh , no . oh , god , no .
oh , god ...
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re gonna be ok .
the ring will bring you back .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re gonna be ok .
you &apos;re gonna be ok , jeremy .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
how &apos;d this happen ?
it was katherine .
she must have been following us this whole time .
what about the cure or silas ?
if there was anything in there at all , it &apos;s all gone .
where the hell is bonnie ?
i have no idea .
she went looking for jeremy last night .
she never came back .
damon , elena is in there
waiting for the gilbert ring to bring jeremy back to life .
ok . fine . we &apos;ll wait with her .
damon , listen to me .
jeremy was one of the five ,
a hunter .
he &apos;s supernatural .
the ring won &apos;t work anymore .
she won &apos;t survive this .
i &apos;ll find bonnie . you get elena off this island .
hey , you &apos;re home .
i was trying to clean the burn mark where kol--
i couldn &apos;t get the spot out .
come on . let &apos;s get him upstairs .
can i get you anything ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just gonna sit here and wait with him until he wakes up .
let me know if you hear anything about bonnie , ok ?
yeah . sure .
unless you &apos;re a blond , a bennett witch ,
or a doppelganger , i suggest you steer clear .
where is it , the cure ?
i know someone has it .
yes , someone-- katherine .
katherine ? the doppelganger ?
yeah . sneaky , little bitch must &apos;ve been spying on us for weeks .
she killed jeremy ...
or somebody did .
he killed your brother . let &apos;s not with the fake sad face .
i didn &apos;t say i was going to miss him ,
but i &apos;m not heartless .
he was elena &apos;s only family .
good . well , you can send flowers
after you help me find bonnie .
we need to find katherine .
if there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s a guarantee in this miserable , little world ,
it &apos;s that katherine pierce is gone .
we need to find bonnie .
oh , and beware of the immortal silas .
if he was asleep in that cave , he &apos;s awake now .
don &apos;t touch it .
i used some of the island &apos;s herbs and berries
to help treat the wound ,
but not being an actual witch ,
i can &apos;t guarantee much .
how are you healed ?
it was silas .
he helped me .
you did it , bonnie . he &apos;s risen .
get away from me .
i know you &apos;re angry with me , ok ,
but now you &apos;ll see , everything i did ,
all those lives lost , they weren &apos;t in vain .
silas is gonna bring them back .
what you want to do isn &apos;t natural , shane .
you can &apos;t bring back the dead .
i think you &apos;ll change your mind now .
what do you mean , now ?
when silas awoke ,
he had to feed to gain his strength .
he &apos;d been desiccating for almost 2 , 000 years .
he needed blood .
jeremy was there .
what are you saying ?
he had--
what are you saying to me ?
he drained him of his blood , bonnie .
jeremy is dead .
how long has she been like that ?
ever since we found his body .
she hasn &apos;t said anything except that she &apos;s waiting for him to wake up .
but he &apos;s not going to wake up .
she knows that , right ?
look . deep down , i think she has to ,
but we &apos;re talking about elena here .
she feels grief more powerfully than anyone else .
i think her denial is the one thing
protecting her from letting it all in .
she can &apos;t stay like that forever .
i know , but i don &apos;t want to be the one to break her out of it ,
not until we know that bonnie is safe ,
not until we get damon over here to , you know--
use the sire bond to convince her that everything is ok ?
i &apos;m not in denial .
i know that he was supernatural ,
but did you see ?
his tattoo is gone .
the tattoo had the spell that opened silas &apos; chamber .
maybe it being gone means
that he fulfilled his supernatural destiny .
maybe he &apos;s back to normal .
it &apos;s possible , right ?
elena--
it &apos;s possible , caroline .
there &apos;s a chance .
it may be miniscule , but it &apos;s hope ,
and i &apos;m gonna hold on to that hope with everything that i &apos;ve got
because there &apos;s no way--
there &apos;s absolutely no way that my brother is dead .
i &apos;m not in denial .
i know that i &apos;m not supposed to be calling ,
but something happened ,
and i need to talk to you , tyler .
so please call me .
do you know where he is ?
as far away from klaus as he can get .
klaus said he wouldn &apos;t stop until he found him .
well , katherine has been running from klaus for 500 years .
it &apos;s not easy , but it &apos;s possible .
it &apos;s probably why she stole the cure .
she wants to bargain for her freedom .
i just can &apos;t believe after all that ,
the cure is just gone .
yeah .
i mean , talk about denial .
in my head , i was thinking there was no way
elena was gonna stay a vampire forever ...
and now without any family .
well , we can &apos;t think about that right now .
we need to make plans , lists .
we need a funeral
or a cover story
or a funeral and a cover story .
i should go tell my mom .
i guess she &apos;ll know what to do .
we should get matt over here .
you &apos;re right . i will do that .
i will call matt , and then i will go tell my mom ,
and then i will make a list or a casserole
or--i don &apos;t know--
whatever people are supposed to do or make in these situations .
what &apos;s that smell ?
it &apos;s his body .
he &apos;s starting to decompose .
tell you mom to get dr. fell over here .
do you think bonnie is dead ?
never thought i &apos;d say this , but i hope not .
i don &apos;t like being out in the open like this .
what , afraid of the big , bad silas ?
no .
scaredy cat .
i &apos;m not a scaredy cat .
my brother kol drove himself mad worrying about silas rising .
it would benefit us all to be a bit concerned ,
and you &apos;re one to talk about being afraid .
you &apos;re so scared , you &apos;re 1 , 200 miles
away from where you &apos;re supposed to be .
hey , somebody needed to find bonnie .
stefan could &apos;ve done that .
aren &apos;t you elena &apos;s current love ?
it &apos;s so hard to keep track these days .
shouldn &apos;t you be home comforting her ,
or are you terrified of being there
when she realizes her brother is dead ?
sorry .
better you than me .
mm , just the guy i wanted to see .
not really .
bonnie , here . drink this .
it &apos;ll calm you down .
i don &apos;t want any of your stupid teas , shane .
bonnie--
jeremy is dead .
bonnie , be careful .
don &apos;t let your magic get out of control .
bonnie ! come on .
bonnie , i am not gonna let you fall apart .
i &apos;m not gonna let you . silas needs you .
he can bring jeremy back .
he can bring everyone back ,
and you &apos;re gonna help him , ok ?
you &apos;re gonna see jeremy again .
elena ?
meredith ? what are you doing here ?
i came to check on your brother .
may i ?
yeah .
you &apos;re not gonna find any vitals .
it &apos;s the same thing that ric used to go through .
he &apos;d just be dead until then he wasn &apos;t .
once , i remember he was gone for almost an entire day .
ric died , like , 4 times before he lost his mind ,
and jeremy has died a few times , too--
3 , i think--so we &apos;re gonna have to--
so we &apos;ll have to keep an eye on him
because i don &apos;t want him to go crazy just like ric did .
elena ...
it looks like jeremy died of extreme blood loss .
his neck also appears to be broken .
the lack of blood explains why there &apos;s no lividity ,
but his muscles have tightened
past the point of rigor mortis .
no .
if he &apos;s left unattended to ,
soon he &apos;ll start to bloat .
within a few hours , his skin will discolor , and--
no . stop , ok ?
just stop . he &apos;s not dead .
i need you to release the body to me .
we &apos;ll get him to a funeral home
and prepare him for a viewing
where you and his friends can say good @-@ bye to him .
he &apos;s not dead , ok ?
elena , stop it .
now you &apos;re all about science ?
where was your science
when you used vampire blood to save my life , huh ?
there is no science here . it &apos;s just magic .
we need magic . we have to find bonnie .
bonnie can fix this . somebody just get me bonnie !
elena--
no . no .
no , matt . it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
bonnie will be here soon ,
and she &apos;ll fix everything , and it &apos;ll be all fine .
everything is gonna be fine .
it &apos;ll be fine .
it &apos;ll be fine . it &apos;ll be fine .
you &apos;re not dosing me again , are you ?
poison your best friend once ,
and suspicion follows you forever .
where are bonnie and damon ?
we lost bonnie on the island .
damon stayed back to try and find her .
that &apos;s funny . doesn &apos;t he hate her ?
he doesn &apos;t hate her .
i think he actually kind of loves her .
you &apos;re mean to the people that you care about .
that &apos;s some messed @-@ up logic .
damon logic .
damon logic .
listen .
i want you to go somewhere with me .
i can &apos;t leave jeremy .
elena ...
there &apos;s nothing you can do right now , ok ?
stefan can stay here with him .
come with me .
please .
here &apos;s the thing .
i was completely willing to accept the fact
that you were one man on a lonely mission to kill ol &apos; silas ,
and then i got boned
by my vixen nemesis miss katherine pierce ,
and then i start thinking
there &apos;s no way that this is a coincidence .
so what do you know , huh ?
took you long enough .
sorry . i had to dig the arrow out of my spine .
thank you for that .
well , if you want a lead on katherine pierce ,
here &apos;s your guy .
torture me all you want . you can &apos;t kill me .
the hunter &apos;s curse will torment you forever .
it &apos;ll be worth it .
he &apos;s right .
you can &apos;t kill him , but that doesn &apos;t mean
we can &apos;t tear him apart piece by piece ,
nerve by nerve until the pain is so severe ,
that your brain shuts it off
to give you one tiny moment of blessed relief ,
and then we &apos;ll heal you and do it again and again and again .
you are creepy .
thank you .
i was tracking dens of vampires across colorado .
katherine found me , said she could help me find silas .
she already knew about the hunter &apos;s mark ,
the cure .
how ?
oh , she had someone on the inside ,
some werewolf girl , friends with your professor .
hayley , tyler lockwood &apos;s old friend .
ah , i knew she was shady . where &apos;d katherine find her ?
new orleans . that &apos;s all i know .
good . let &apos;s throw him in a well .
if he starves to death , it &apos;s not our fault .
i &apos;m gonna go find bonnie .
we &apos;ve got a lead on the cure , damon .
i &apos;m gonna find it but i suppose you don &apos;t mind .
you never wanted elena to be human again , anyway .
i wanted that cure for her because it &apos;s what she wanted .
you might think i &apos;m afraid to go back ,
but i &apos;m not because i know what she needs .
she needs me to bring her best friend home .
we got to get you home if you &apos;re gonna help silas raise the dead .
i don &apos;t understand what i can do .
well , silas can &apos;t do magic .
he was a witch ,
but after he became immortal , that ended .
he can be a witch or a vampire , but never both .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been teaching you expressions ,
so you can do his work for him .
what ? how ?
using the power of 3 massacres .
each massacre of 12 marks the earth with power ,
and you can use expression to tap into that power .
3 ? you &apos;ve had 36 people killed ?
no . i &apos;ve had 24 people killed ...
12 people at the young farm , 12 hybrids .
you and i are gonna complete the triangle .
we &apos;re what ?
there needs to be another massacre , but it &apos;s ok .
they &apos;re gonna come back , it &apos;s worth it .
i &apos;m not helping you kill 12 people , shane .
won &apos;t you if it meant you can see jeremy again ,
your grams , everybody you and your friends ever lost ?
i think you would .
no .
bonnie ?
jeremy ?
it hurts .
jeremy .
help me .
i can help you , i &apos;ll help you .
i can help you .
no .
he asked you to help him , didn &apos;t he ?
he needs your help .
you can do this , bonnie .
you know you can .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
i &apos;m bumping the ac .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to leave him in there for much longer .
yeah , i know .
i &apos;ve been alive for almost two centuries now .
you &apos;d think with the amount of people that i &apos;ve seen die ,
it would hurt less each time .
never does .
no . no . it never does .
i see this every day .
sometimes i think that denial is the worst part for people like us .
because we know the truth .
we can see they &apos;re on a collision course with it , and
all we can do is brace ourselves for impact .
did you find her ?
i &apos;m still looking . how is she ?
she &apos;s losing it , damon .
we can do what we can to delay things here ,
but we got to get jeremy to the morgue before it gets ugly .
damn it . i can &apos;t just leave her behind .
i can &apos;t show up without bonnie .
i think you have to .
at this point , the sire bond is probably the only thing
that &apos;s gonna keep elena together .
i can go back to find bonnie .
i &apos;m on my way .
i could actually hug you right now .
where have you been ? how &apos;d you find me ?
shane led the way .
he told me what to do , damon .
i know how to bring jeremy back .
you brought me to the stoner pit ?
i want you to see something .
vicki .
remember when jer was so into my sister ?
when our parents died . it was his rebel phase .
i found this after vick died .
it made me smile ...
and this .
jeremy and vicky . did he do that ?
after they found vick &apos;s body ,
i remember thinking that things didn &apos;t feel over ,
you know , that there was no possible way
that she could be gone forever .
then she wasn &apos;t .
my point is , this town ,
this crazy @-@ ass world we live in .
sometimes not being willing to accept that someone is gone
is because maybe they &apos;re not ...
at least not completely .
is that really what you believe ?
yes .
if i compelled you to tell me the truth ,
is that what you would say ?
i would tell you that it &apos;s ok to have hope ...
because sometimes that &apos;s all that keeps me going .
thanks , matt .
stefan ?
damon found bonnie .
the plane is there waiting for them when they get off the island .
they &apos;ll be home in a few hours .
thank god . is she ok ?
yeah . he said she &apos;s fine .
listen , elena .
you might have been right . there might be something .
she knows what to do , doesn &apos;t she ?
let &apos;s just see what she says when she gets home , ok ?
ok . we &apos;ll be home soon .
if you &apos;re smart ,
you &apos;ll use the cure to kill silas .
killing silas is your supernatural destiny , not mine .
all right . ok . well , you be careful up there , you know ,
because he &apos;s up there running about .
you sure about that ?
you don &apos;t believe me ?
check my pack .
i found it in the chamber where he lay .
they say no one has seen him . no one knows his face .
how do you hide from the devil
when you don &apos;t know what he looks like ?
who knows ?
maybe i &apos;m him .
mark my words ,
if you don &apos;t use the cure to kill him ,
doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re human or vampire .
you &apos;re doomed .
we all are .
good luck to you ,
you &apos;ve all brought this upon yourselves .
may you rot in it !
tyler , it &apos;s me again .
so i was thinking about it ,
and you probably ditched your phone ,
which is the smartest thing that you could do .
so i don &apos;t know when you &apos;re gonna get this ,
but things were looking kind of bleak for a minute ,
and ... i don &apos;t know ... maybe they &apos;re turning around .
so when you get this , call me back ,
and i &apos;ll tell you everything .
thank god .
we were so , so worried .
i &apos;m ok .
could you get stefan out here ?
they said that she knows what to do .
caroline , i need to talk to my brother .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
whatever you ask of me , i &apos;ll do it .
then you will see him again .
there &apos;s just a few things we have to do first .
it &apos;s called an expression triangle .
i need to complete it for silas .
what ?
she &apos;s out of her mind , stefan .
the nutty professor has got her totally brainwashed .
bonnie , you can &apos;t kill 12 people .
i know it sounds crazy ,
but it &apos;s the only way to get enough power .
to do what ?
when silas was buried by the witch qetsiyah ,
she left him with the cure and two choices ...
stay mortal and rot
or take the cure and eventually die in there of old age .
he &apos;s been trapped in there for 2 , 000 years .
at some point , wouldn &apos;t death by old age have been better ?
no , because , you see , qetsiyah had already one @-@ upped him .
she knew that he wanted to die
so that he could find peace ,
be reunited with his one true love .
so she created another side .
as a purgatory for all supernatural beings ,
ensuring that if he died , he &apos;d end up there forever .
that &apos;s where you come in .
why me ?
because you ,
as qetsiyah &apos;s descendant can make the other side go away .
how ?
i mean , the whole flight back home ,
all she could talk about was how she is the one
that can drop the veil between this side and the other side .
drop the veil ? what does that even mean ?
what it means is , the myth about silas being able to raise the dead
is not just one or some .
it &apos;s every supernatural being over there .
once the veil is dropped ,
the other side doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
there &apos;s nothing separating us .
we &apos;re all just one .
3 massacres , 3 hot spots ,
and the witch spell of the century .
every supernatural being over there is back with a vengeance .
i can &apos;t do that .
what ? oh , no . yes , you can .
yes , you can .
all the witches , your ancestors ,
who &apos;ve been persecuted throughout time ,
your grams , jeremy , they &apos;ll all be back .
you can do this .
you will do this .
bonnie , you are talking like a crazy person .
you are not killing 12 people ,
and you sure as hell can &apos;t invite every monster
who has ever died back into this world .
caroline , i think she knows that .
i can do it . i have the power .
i can bring everyone back ...
jeremy , alaric , vicki .
bonnie , stop it .
you can &apos;t just say these things .
i &apos;ll get it .
hey , look . i &apos;ll get it .
i said i &apos;ll get it .
hello ?
elena .
it &apos;s april ... young .
i was looking for jeremy ,
and his cell phone keeps going straight to voicemail .
jeremy can &apos;t come to the phone right now . he &apos;s not ...
i &apos;m sorry .
he &apos;s dead .
elena .
he &apos;s dead .
he &apos;s dead . damon , he &apos;s dead ,
and he &apos;s been dead this entire time , and i ...
oh , my god .
i can smell him . how long has he smelled like that ?
talk to me . i can help you .
how ? how are you gonna help me ? how ?
ok . ok . we have to take care of his body .
bring him downstairs .
we shouldn &apos;t ...
just carry him down , please .
where &apos;s bonnie ?
we told matt to take her home . we thought it &apos;d be best .
ok . guess we &apos;re gonna have to do this the old @-@ fashioned way .
do what ?
put his body on the couch .
elena ?
elena , you need help finding something ?
got it .
what are you doing ?
we need a cover story , right ?
you think i didn &apos;t hear you guys talking earlier ?
well , what are we gonna say-- animal attack ,
tumble down the stairs ?
no . we burn the house down with him inside of it .
elena , stop it .
why , because you want me to not be in denial ?
you want me to face the truth ?
this is the truth , stefan .
i don &apos;t want to live here anymore .
i don &apos;t want these sketches .
i don &apos;t want this x @-@ box .
not gonna need this bourbon anymore .
alaric is not here to drink it , i mean ,
unless you guys are willing to bring back
every supernatural creature on the other side to get him bick .
would you ?
i know you want your drinking buddy back .
would you , damon ?
because i wouldn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , does that make me a bad person ?
i have no idea .
he &apos;s not gonna need that anymore .
elena , stop it . you &apos;re scaring me .
what else are we supposed to do with the body , caroline ?
i mean , there &apos;s no room in the gilbert family plot .
jenna and john took the last spots .
no , no , elena . stop .
there &apos;s nothing here for me anymore , stefan .
every inch of this house
is filled with memories of the people that i love that have died--
my mom , my dad , jeremy ,
and jenna and alaric , john , even john .
i mean , they &apos;re all dead . everyone is dead .
so what am i supposed to--
i mean , how am i gonna--
i can &apos;t even--
there &apos;s nothing left for me . aah !
elena , i need you to calm down .
no , no , no .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i--
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
no . it hurts . it hurts . just make it stop .
please make it stop . it hurts . ah ...
damon ...
help her .
i can help you .
i want you to let me help you .
i can help you .
how ?
turn it off .
what ? no , no .
just turn it off ,
and everything will go away .
that &apos;s what you have to do .
it &apos;s what i want you to do .
just turn it off .
hey , it &apos;s me . look .
i hate to leave this on your voicemail ,
but i think that you need to know .
jeremy is dead , tyler . i &apos;m so sorry .
i thought that you would call and i could tell you ,
but then you didn &apos;t , so--
just call me when you get this , ok ?
i need you ,
and there &apos;s no way that yesterday was the last time
that i &apos;m ever going to see you or talk to you .
it can &apos;t be . so just ... call me , tyler .
please .
it &apos;s gonna be ok , matt , you &apos;ll see .
i &apos;ll bring him back .
get some sleep , bon . we can talk tomorrow .
did you tell them ?
they don &apos;t think i can do it .
oh , they &apos;re just scared . they &apos;re afraid to believe .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking .
you said if i dropped the veil to the other side ,
that the dead &apos;ll return ,
but that &apos;s only for the supernatural .
what about the 12 people that died on the young farm ?
they were a necessary sacrifice
for the greater good .
they &apos;ve passed on . they &apos;ve found peace .
it &apos;s all anyone wants .
that &apos;s all silas wants .
we &apos;ll do this together , you and i.
we are the beginning .
blast it .
shane .
silas .
it was a mistake .
it wasn &apos;t , and you know it .
this is the only way she &apos;s gonna survive .
we &apos;ll help her , keep an eye on her .
when she &apos;s ready , i &apos;ll use the sire bond to bring her back .
her humanity , damon , it was all she had left .
humanity means nothing when you don &apos;t have anyone to care about , stefan .
she had you .
she lost her brother .
i &apos;m not enough , not this time .
listen , damon .
i know that you and i , we &apos;ve been through some ...
bad spots lately ,
especially when it comes to her .
yeah . well ...
guess none of that matters anymore .
i just , um--
i want you to know that , um--
i know , stefan .
elena , don &apos;t do this .
we can find another cover story .
this is the best one .
no one &apos;ll ask questions .
ok . if you burn down the house , it &apos;ll be gone .
what if one day when this is all over ,
you want to come home again ?
i won &apos;t .
