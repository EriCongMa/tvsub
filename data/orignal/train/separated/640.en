Divorce suits you.
Your charms won't work on me, Pascal.
Not this time.
I have no intention of merging our companies.
What if I got you the one thing you've always wanted?
I have everything a man could want.
Except Victoria.
I sort of gave my parole officer your address.
He's this millennial computer genius from prison.
I have no intention of going anywhere.
Yet this property belongs to me.
It's time to show our fathers what we're capable of.
Care to join me?
Faking a pregnancy to force Daniel into marriage.
Your dirty, little secret is out.
I had to create a public break from the Graysons.
What's "TWM"?
My mom said she never knew who wrote the letter.
It was European.
Pascal is a part of this?
Yeah, I think he is.
Addiction -- an impulse that, once indulged,
is impossible to pacify.
Even when starved, the hunger survives.
First the Dolce & Gabbana.
And now George de la Tour's "The Fortune Teller"?
It's your favorite, no?
At the MET where it belongs.
I thought you'd like to enjoy it for a month or two.
I cannot be bought -- especially by a man
whose reputation for romance is reckless.
The result of a lifetime of mistakes.
You don't know me, Pascal.
Or what I want.
A love that will always triumph over darkness.
A love that I would lay down my life for.
At least you've moved on from the note to...
other unsolvable riddles.
Have you heard from Aiden?
No. And I don't expect to.
He's honoring what I wanted.
Well, I've been trying to do that, too.
I hacked into the Lemarchal mainframe,
but wading through every file
of Europe's largest media conglomerate
for the letters "TWM" is just gonna take eons.
It definitely can't be "The white-haired man," right?
It fits, but... I am pretty sure that
that nickname was a "Nol-riginal."
Well, I can't wait any longer.
What are you gonna do?
The letter's not enough to incriminate the Graysons,
but Pascal has a piece of the puzzle that I don't,
and there may be more.
So if I can get close to him, gain access --
Then you can finally finish the puzzle.
Hey. Working hard?
The "Voulez" gossip tip line
has pretty much become a pascal tracker.
Does that mean Emily's dropped off the radar?
Yeah. She's yesterday's news.
Though I'll never forget what she did to you.
To us.
Emily lied to our entire family, Charlotte.
Including you.
You'd think she'd just leave town,
instead of staying here and making things harder for you.
Which is why we're gonna return the favor
and go after her friends.
We?
I don't know, Daniel.
No, no, no, no. Look, look, look, look.
You helped me figure out what dad was up to.
Now we can put those skills to an even worthier cause.
Okay.
But Jack isn't involved in all this.
I want to keep it that way.
Fine. Porter's off the table.
Okay. I'll see you later.
"Former Hamptons royal Stevie Grayson
"Created her own drama at the opera
"By arriving on the arm of her secret son,
local tavern owner Jack Porter."
It's a great photo of us.
You're not upset?
I assumed you wanted it released on your own terms.
It was.
I told the photographer.
I have seen how secrets are used as leverage.
And considering you're about to own Grayson Manor,
the last thing I wanted to do
was give Conrad or Victoria any ammo.
I still can't understand
how you could be married to that monster.
Conrad wasn't always so terrible.
We met on a blind date.
He was so relaxed and charming.
We ended up having such a great time.
We went to the airport and --
and took the first flight to anywhere.
You know, trying to picture him like that
is nearly impossible.
No, it didn't last long.
But he's not solely to blame.
You don't have to defend him.
I'm not, Jack.
You've never seen me drunk.
And thank god you never will.
All I said was
"The fortune teller" is her favorite painting,
And you had it designated on loan to her?
I thought you knew Victoria better than
to make grand gestures.
I thought you were a man who could keep his promises.
I am, but to erase your soiled past
from Victoria's memory requires a slow burn.
Just give it time.
Well, don't waste mine.
Make it happen, or you can forget about our partnership.
Just relax, Pascal.
We'll both get what we deserve.
Anything else for you, Monsieur Lemarchal?
Another montecristo.
My apologies, sir, but we just sold our last two.
Je serais heureux de partager.
Mrs. Grayson.
Or should I say Miss Thorne
after last week's excitement at the opera?
Emily is fine, if I may call you Pascal.
I'm aware that many of my news outlets thrive on scandal,
but I have no interest in becoming one.
Well, then at least, may I?
Merci.
You after a discharge, solider?
Because it looks like
you just shot yourself in the foot.
Not at all.
Just changed tactics.
To Victoria.
Back in our midst and back on the market.
Oh, I don't know about that.
Pascal Lemarchal?
He was rather dashing at the opera.
Didn't you two date before Conrad?
It's a regrettable mistake of my youth,
one that I'm loathe to repeat or discuss.
Well, I was just happy to hear that Daniel
has finally broken his pattern with Emily.
I still cannot believe
that that girl faked her pregnancy.
And everyone believed her!
Except you, Victoria.
You were suspicious from the onset.
Oh, I still am.
Emily Thorne is a plague on our homes.
And since she seems determined to stay,
I would appreciate if you would all keep an eye on her for me.
You can count on us.
Anyone who is an enemy of yours
is not long for this world.
Oh, there's another one.
Excuse me.
Get out of my house.
Oh, your house?
Well, this placard I intercepted at the front door
augurs otherwise.
Stevie's not gonna let up.
Neither will I.
Why are you here, Conrad?
You know, I-I'd heard rumors that there was a certain
de la Tour original gracing the foyer.
It's a shameless volley from Pascal that I returned.
Oh, good.
Because the idea of you with that man
makes my blood boil.
Well, that almost makes him appealing.
However, your opinion
is as inappropriate as this intrusion.
I would think you would be bothering your first ex-wife
over her recent public revelation.
Revelation?
Oh, Conrad.
All the morning newspapers you flip through,
and you always skip Page 6.
You sizing up the competition?
Not exactly.
They want me to be their new editor-in-chief.
In Rome.
I didn't, uh -- didn't know
that was something you wanted.
Oh, no, it's not.
No, I mean, this is an amazing opportunity.
But all I really want is "Voulez."
And you.
Then you're a lucky girl, 'cause you've already got both.
Well, this magazine will never be mine
as long as my father is in the picture.
I get it, Margaux. I do.
But Rome?
No, I know. I know.
That's why I won't take it.
I love you too much.
And I can't wait to start the next step of our lives together.
No, I...
I can't let you just throw this chance away.
You need to seriously consider it.
I don't know.
I don't know. There's so much to think about.
Being away from you. Leaving all this.
Passing on the opportunity
to finally cut ties with your father.
Are you sure we could handle this?
No.
But...I know that I couldn't handle
keeping you from something that might make you truly happy.
Those sticky fingers of yours certainly paid off.
Pascal's coin?
It's a poker chip from an ultra-exclusive table in Macau.
The buy-in is $1 million.
So Pascal's a gambling man.
I guess I'll have to earn his respect
by beating him at his own game.
So, what's next?
"Adventures in Babysitting"? Really?
All right, well, what about your -- oh.
Most embarrassing moment ever?
I just got a contender.
Javier, my wannabe bestie,
this is Emily, my actual bestie.
Are you two gonna hit up Atlantic City?
I have a new method to beat roulette
I am dying to try right now.
It was nice to meet you, Javier.
I'll talk to you later, Nolan.
What is this?
A program to hit on girls while you're under house arrest?
No. It's actually a prototype of what I'm working on.
See, it built an interactive avatar
based on someone's social-media profile
and my predictive logarithms.
And since Charlotte Grayson
is famous, scandalous, and pretty,
She has quite the size-6 footprint to work from.
Hmm. Watch.
Charvatar, honey, um...
which neighbor do you have the most in common with?
It was Emily. Now it's you.
Oh. Well, I see.
It's a program designed to inflate your ego.
Mm. It only speaks truth.
A Harvard buddy of mine is the perfect guy
to help us deal with your father.
It's a bit of a risky move, but...
Yeah, actually, Daniel...
I've changed my mind.
"Vito Splendido" made me an offer,
and I'm thinking about taking it.
Well, I expected other magazines to try and poach you.
I just didn't expect you to give up so quickly.
I'm not.
I started "Voulez" to break free from my father,
but he won't even let me have that.
Margaux, come on. We can push him out.
I'm sorry, Daniel.
My only hesitation was leaving Jack,
and he encouraged me to go.
Char. Could -- could you come here a sec?
I was just trying to remember.
When you managed to help Emily get all her memory back,
how did you do that?
I didn't. That was Jack, remember?
Of course.
My bad.
And h-he asked you to sneak him in here, too, right?
What are you getting at?
Just that Jack seemed to put a lot of
behind-the-scenes effort into Emily after the shooting.
Yeah. He's her friend, Daniel.
Is that all?
Because I just think it's odd
that he's trying to push you to leave
now that Emily's single.
Daniel, stop. Don't listen to him.
You're trying to manipulate me.
No, I'm just trying to get you to open your eyes.
Jack is doing exactly what your father always has --
what's best for him.
It's time to do what's best for you.
Miss Thorne?
Pardon the late intrusion,
but I prefer the intimacy of hand-delivery.
I wanted to invite you to an event that I'm throwing tomorrow --
A Monte Carlo Night for charity.
I doubt you'll be able to resist
considering it allows you to indulge
in both your favorite virtue and vice.
Let's see.
All of the proceeds go to Recherche D'un Rem√®de
of which you are a founding member, no?
And it happens to be a cause that's dear to my heart.
Because of your image issues,
I'm afraid you're not the best person to help me fight childhood leukemia.
Well, there are two sides to every story, Pascal.
As there are two sides to every coin.
So you are a liar and a thief?
There's so much about me you don't know.
Come to the party, and you'll find out.
Another ex-Mrs. Grayson.
I'd say "Welcome to the club,"
but I don't care much for the other member.
So, how does it feel?
Liberating.
And, uh, thank you for your old files.
I hope it spurs something new to help clear David's name.
You let me know if you need anything else.
Well, actually, I was wondering
what you could tell me about Pascal LeMarchal?
Conrad and him seem to have quite a past.
And not just in business.
Pascal actually dated Victoria first.
I don't know what happened, but when I got out of rehab,
she was with Conrad, and Pascal was history.
So was I.
Look who's here.
There's my big boy.
You want to go look at the boats?
Let's go look at the boats.
That sounds fun.
Emily, excuse us.
Yeah, of course.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Except Margaux was offered a job in Italy.
It killed me, but I encouraged her to take it.
It's what's best for her right now.
Does that mean that you're leaving, too?
We haven't discussed it yet. Maybe.
I -- though I am buying this house,
so it'll be long distance for awhile.
Guess I'm joining the club, huh?
Actually, I ended things with Aiden.
You were ready to spend the rest of your life with him.
What -- what changed?
I did.
I guess.
I was going through a lot. Too much.
And, of course, I pushed him away.
Even though you still love him?
If you want to be happy when this is all over,
you need to tell him.
I can't.
The Emily Thorne that I know can do anything.
Thanks.
Daniel, please! Charles Hayworth?
That would be like dating your father all over again.
You're the one who stayed married to the guy for 25 years.
And look how well that turned out.
You have to admit, you did build an empire together.
Well, which seemed important when I was your age,
but it's the last thing I'm looking for in a man now.
Yeah? What are you looking for, then?
Someone who would take the time to understand me.
Well, that's no easy feat.
And it shouldn't be. Come on.
I heard Pascal made a little play for you earlier.
Well, he has much to learn if he ever hopes to win me back.
I'm sorry. "Back"?
You two dated? How did I never hear about this?
Did you ever really want to know about your mother's dating history?
God, no, but Pascal?
Oh, well, by the time I went to Paris on scholarship,
I was 16, and I had no one then.
We met at the flea market, believe it not.
He was working a booth there.
And, um...
There was just something about him.
We were crazy about each other.
Pascal taught me how to trust.
And? What happened?
Well, my visa was only temporary,
and I had to return to New York.
It seemed like the end of the world to both of us at the time.
He sent me an orchid for every day we were apart.
Well, he must have been smitten.
Hmm, or he was assuaging his guilt.
I flew to Paris to surprise him,
and I caught him with another woman.
That's why you don't want to deal with him now.
Well, we all make mistakes in our youth.
Don't I know it.
Looks like Emily's making her next move.
She's hosting an event tomorrow night.
This is for Pascal's charity.
Now, what do you suppose she wants with him?
There's only one way to find out.
What are you doing here?
Thanks, buddy.
I, uh -- I waited at your place for a little while.
Your neighbor said that I could probably find you here.
He was nice.
Yeah, well, people are happy here, Emily.
What do you want?
Well, I thought that maybe you'd have some insight.
Insight?
Okay.
So you -- you broke our agreement,
you tracked me down,
you flew all the way out here to Bermuda for insight?
Can't you just admit that you came to see me?
So, I wanted to see you. I'm sorry.
Maybe I shouldn't have come.
I miss you.
Well, that's what happens when people part.
It's -- it's called moving on.
Aiden, can't you just hear me out?
I wasn't myself. You know that.
And I'm not Nolan.
You can't just give me the cold shoulder
and expect me to come running to save you the next day.
All right? I've done all I can for you.
We're on our own from now on.
Margaux!
I just spent two hours with an Interpol agent.
He received an anonymous tip
that I was using "Voulez" as a tax shelter!
I can see how that might be a problem,
since it's illegal.
Do you realize the damage an investigation like that will do? Huh?
Not only to me, but also to you!
Me?
I am just the silly daughter of the great Pascal LeMarchal.
Who could believe I was involved in such devious plans?
Now, as it turns out,
Daniel Grayson is a friend of the Interpol agent.
And we would be quite happy to make your problem go away...
if you give me what I want.
When I arrived here, I was worried
for my little girl swimming with the sharks.
Now...
I'm more worried for the sharks.
"Voulez" is yours. I'm out.
And Conrad, too.
He was the only reason for your visit, after all.
Not the only reason.
Well, I hope I'm not interrupting.
Just filling out the final paperwork
to make your old house my new one.
Are you drunk?
I'm fine.
I heard your other news. About Jack.
Is it true?
It is.
It hits harder than I expected.
You know, at first, I thought...
"Is he mine?"
But then I remembered that by the time you got to rehab,
we were already sleeping in separate places.
Me in our bedroom, and you
wherever you happened to pass out that night.
The pain that I felt...
Leave it to Conrad Grayson to make my addiction
and unplanned pregnancy about him.
It happened while we were married.
To think that I'd be unaffected is naive.
Just as naive as blaming me solely for our divorce.
I have never done that.
No, we share the blame for what we became.
But I never suspected
the Stowaway was anything but a refuge,
but to hear that you... had a child...
...with another while we were married?
Conrad...
Come on. We planned on having children of our own, and you...
Well, it's abundantly clear why you didn't come to me
to make amends during your 12 steps,
but that doesn't excuse the lie.
I was your husband.
I deserved to know.
You're right.
Has Mr. Lemarchal arrived yet?
You just had to wear red.
I guess I'll be betting on black for the night.
I'm surprised you'll be betting on anything,
seeing as I left the name "Grayson" off the guest list.
Oh, honey, I don't need guest lists.
Or have you already forgotten the doors I opened for you?
You were a nobody before me.
Quite the turnout for an event hosted by a nobody.
Trust me -- people are only here
to see the car wreck that you've become.
Once the blood is hosed off the pavement,
They'll be on their way.
How did you afford all of this, anyway?
Thank you for reminding me.
In all the drama of the divorce,
I forgot to return this.
Margaux, hi.
Emily.
Daniel, come. We should be celebrating.
You invited your ex? Awkward.
Of course I didn't. His arrogance is unmatched.
Well, except, of course, by the French.
Speak of le diable...
you've clearly caught his eye.
Prove you can play at his level, and you'll have his ear.
Time to ante up.
What is going on between you and Emily Thorne?
I had no idea
It would take jealousy to get your attention.
I am trying to help you, as I know your proclivity
is to chase the first skirt that flares at you.
Can't we move on?
Yes, let's stay in the present.
Emily is playing you like she played my son.
But I'm not your son.
Pascal, there you are.
Victoria.
Emily.
I've reserved a high-stakes table for the two of us.
Care to join me?
Very tempting.
But I had a different opponent in mind tonight.
Try your hand at poker?
I would love to.
Great.
Emily...
I've found you someone you can compete with.
Shall we?
Yeah, let me get, uh...
...some on 8...
22, 19, 9, and 4.
You just bet my birthday.
No kidding. You're a Leo?
Next you're gonna tell me
that you love '80s teen movies and sashimi.
I'm charlotte.
Javier.
Why haven't I seen you around before, Javier?
I just moved here. Spent the last couple years upstate.
College?
Prison.
Should I not have said that?
No, I'm glad you did.
Your honesty is refreshing.
As is your attitude towards ex-cons.
How about you let one buy you a drink?
I would, but the powers that be won't let me have one.
Javier? A word?
So...
...you tweaked the transmitter.
You did say I was genius.
No, no.
Correction. I said your program was genius.
You, on the other hand, are proving exceedingly stupid.
My god, to think I was actually considering a partnership.
Hold up. Are you serious?
I was.
But, I mean, this little stunt
Is making it very hard to trust you.
I will stay put from now on. Promise.
Just give me one -- one second. One.
So, uh, I got to run.
But instead of that drink,
how about I just do you one better.
See you around, neighbor.
Winner -- 22!
Wait. You won.
Don't I know it.
Yes! Pay me.
All right!
Good job. Good job.
Jack!
I forced my father out of "Voulez."
It's all mine.
That's great!
That's exactly what you wanted. H-how did you do that?
Well, Daniel and I came up with a plan.
My father didn't know what hit him.
Daniel?
Are you sure he has your best interests at heart?
I couldn't have gotten my magazine back without him.
He's not the bad person you think he is.
You don't know him.
Yes, I do, Jack.
We've been friends since we were 10,
which is longer than I can say for you and Emily,
who it seems has quite the reputation herself.
Trust me. Emily's nothing like what the papers are saying.
Maybe you're just blinded by your feelings for her.
What are you talking about?
Is she why you're so eager for me to take a job in Italy?
Of course not! Why -- why would you think something like that?
Okay. Forget it.
Forget I said anything. Come.
Come celebrate with me.
Are you sure?
Yes.
All right, well, Carl could use a new pair of shoes.
And a college fund.
There she is. Just in time.
I could use some good luck.
Oh, come on, man.
Jack, it's fine.
Come on!
Once...
I gave Jack up,
I wanted to make it work with you.
But I'd been away for a year,
and Victoria had stolen you.
So I-I didn't have my husband
or my son,
and I just -- I fell apart again.
I hated you for leaving me.
But now I realize that I drove you away.
I loved you, Steph.
We had our demons -- maybe I still have mine --
But we had some...
very good years before they took over.
I know.
I regret having involved you in my affairs yet again.
If there was any way I could extricate you
from this new battle with Victoria, I would.
No good can come of it.
Two good things did --
Jack and Carl.
Which only highlights our separate paths.
I hope we can move on.
Leave this mess behind us.
I agree.
When all is said and done,
I am truly happy for you, Steph.
Conrad, wait.
It's time I put something to bed.
Pascal, you can get the paperwork started, mon ami.
I've got Victoria's trump card.
The last card.
And the winner tonight is...
my charity, of course.
And the river.
Queen of spades.
The bet is to my left.
$120,000 to you.
Oh, Emily, I'm afraid you'll have to fold.
You don't have enough to match the bet.
I think Daniel's engagement ring should be enough to cover it.
I call.
You've been bluffing since you set foot in the Hamptons.
Why stop now?
Well, maybe I like to try to throw you off your game.
Cards, please.
Three queens.
For once, she wins legitimately.
Shall we settle up?
Yes.
You have quite an impressive poker face, Miss Thorne.
You've been playing me from the start.
Why would you say that?
I think you're far smarter than the public knows.
And I brought you here 'cause I believe
your interest in me is only professional.
If I'm wrong, I'll wish you good night.
Well, you caught me.
So...
...let's get down to business.
My short-lived marriage to Daniel
provided me access to the Graysons' deepest and darkest secrets.
And you're looking to cash in?
Something like that. Provided I can be sure you're an ally.
An intriguing offer.
I like that.
But why come to a friend of Conrad's?
Because you're friends second, competitors first.
And I don't know about you,
but I make it a point to collect dirt on my rivals.
We have more in common than I expected.
You've got a deal.
Should we discuss details?
Pascal...
I feel that I've put a considerable amount of energy
into getting your attention.
And now that I have it, I think it's your turn to get mine.
Thank you for the drink.
I sent the sitter home. I hope it's okay.
Of course.
Actually, I'd rather see you after the night I've had.
What are you doing here?
I had a bit of a tough one, too.
Conrad came by my suite.
What did he do?
Believe it or not...
he just wanted to talk.
It took me back to a time that I left behind long ago.
Not an easy thing to relive.
I thought you said your marriage wasn't all bad.
When it was bad, it was horrendous.
Especially when my drinking got out of control.
The fights we used to get into...
And when that would happen,
the only thing that would get me through it
was a couple dozen drinks.
So...a-are you okay?
I will be.
I just need to get a good night's rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Good night.
I received your gift.
And this one I haven't come to return.
Dare I ask how you did it?
And show my hand? Never.
Just as you didn't show yours earlier.
You let Emily win.
I wanted to see how committed she was to her next move.
You're tracking her.
I'm hunting her.
Then you'll be interested to know
the only thing Emily wanted to discuss
was your family's secrets.
And for you, I will find out why.
I'm grateful to you, Pascal.
Despite my marriages, my dalliances,
I still remember the night I lost you.
It's the blond dragon. My favorite.
It's thought to be extinct.
Almost.
I'm sorry.
I will never betray you again.
I know the sting of betrayal all too well.
And I'm not one to forgive and forget.
But I'm willing to try.
So... Pascal was Nixon'ing you?
I knew there was a camera in the room
when my phone picked up interference.
A cheap, French imitation WhaleCam.
While I was trying to get him to talk,
he was doing the same to me -- on tape.
Hmm. Guy's good.
And he's not working alone.
Look, I don't have proof,
but I've been studying Victoria's face for years.
She folded the winning hand. I'm sure of it.
What, so you're saying the queen lost on purpose?
I think she wanted me to get close to Pascal.
That means Frenchy's a dead end.
Along with his mainframe.
I completed my "TWM" search
and came up with... nada.
I'm kind of sort of out of ideas.
I've got one.
Aiden.
This isn't about you, Emily.
It's about this.
"TWM" Is Trevor Warren Mathis.
Pascal was talking about my father.
