once upon a time ,
an evil queen banished every storybook character
you &apos;ve ever known to our world .
they don &apos;t remember who they are .
only one knows the truth ,
and only one can break her spell .
if you need anything ...
you &apos;ll find me .
always .
you belong together .
you &apos;re the only thing in this whole place that feels right .
no one comes here , ever .
anyplace to get a room around here ?
you &apos;re staying ?
that &apos;s the plan .
what are you doing here ?
fixing my bike .
no , i mean in storybrooke .
just visiting .
what &apos;s that ?
a box .
what &apos;s inside it ?
just something i need to do what i came here for .
i thought you were just visiting .
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t have something to do .
henry ?
you better get to school .
looks like a storm &apos;s coming .
henry .
who was that ?
this is chief meterologist bill gozen
with your up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute storybrooke weather .
well , break out those galoshes , folks . it &apos;s gonna get soggy .
we &apos;ve got a major storm system moving down the coast .
the latest doppler shows the worst band of precipitation
is moving into storybrooke right about the time .
you &apos;re putting the kids to ...
i cannot believe i overslept .
it &apos;s only 7 : 10 . you &apos;ve got plenty of time to get to school .
no , i have to be there at 7 : 15 .
science fair .
i &apos;m helping the kids with their project before school .
i &apos;m sure if you &apos;re five minutes late , they &apos;ll live .
we &apos;re making a volcano .
okay .
one cream and sugar . one black .
thank you .
good morning .
morning .
uh , i should go . i &apos;m gonna be late for work .
oh , the animal shelter , right ? how &apos;s that going ?
well , the apes haven &apos;t taken over .
yet .
not on my watch .
this is making a volcano ?
i was--
i get it .
he comes here every morning at 7 : 15 a.m. to get coffee .
for him and his wife .
i know , i know , i know . i just like to ...
come here to see him .
so you &apos;re a stalker ?
no , not really .
maybe a little bit .
and it &apos;s not like i &apos;m following him .
i just know that he spends his mornings with kathryn ,
gets his coffee , then drives to the animal shelter
to start work at 7 : 30 , and then he &apos;s home around 5 : 00 .
oh , is that all ?
thursdays they pick up chinese for dinner .
i can &apos;t get him out of my head .
i know .
maybe the first step is not showing up here tomorrow .
love &apos;s the worst .
i wish there was a magic cure .
hey !
it &apos;s me .
red .
the spear , snow .
sorry .
i wasn &apos;t expecting you for a month .
it &apos;s been a month .
has it ?
you &apos;re really taking well to the solitude , aren &apos;t ya ?
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s exactly what i wanted ,
to be out here , away .
and that you are .
here you go .
thank you .
so ...
how are things back in the world ?
come on . ask what you really want .
i don &apos;t know what you mean .
okay , fine .
tell me .
the wedding &apos;s happening .
prince james is marrying midas &apos; daughter ...
in two days &apos; time .
you okay ?
i just thought the longer i was out here ,
the easier it would be to forget him , but ...
instead , all i do is think about him .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wish there was a way to get him out of my head .
what ? is there ?
of course not . i mean , that would ...
red , what do you know ?
come on . i helped you when no one else would .
what do you know ?
there are whispers ,
whispers of a man
who can achieve even the most unholy of requests ,
a man who can do what you ask .
who is this man ?
how much for this ?
excuse me ?
your boat .
exquisite craftsmanship .
it &apos;s not for sale .
of course it is , dearie .
no one comes to see me without a deal in mind .
so you &apos;re rumplestiltskin .
indeed , i am .
i &apos;ve been looking forward to meeting you .
you really are the fairest of them all , aren &apos;t you ?
what can i do for you ?
i need a cure .
what ails you , doll ?
a broken heart .
ah , the most painful of afflictions .
well , i &apos;m afraid if you want me to make him love you ,
no can do , and nothing can .
no , that &apos;s not the problem .
we can &apos;t be together .
well , that i can help you with .
that &apos;ll do it ?
not yet .
no two loves are ... exactly alike .
we must make this ... personal .
so if i drink that , i &apos;ll no longer love him ?
the next time you see the object of your grief ,
you won &apos;t even remember who he is .
i won &apos;t remember him ?
love is the most powerful magic , so the cure must be ...
extreme .
&quot; extreme &quot; sounds like an understatement .
don &apos;t doubt yourself now , dearie .
love makes us sick ,
haunts our dreams ,
destroys our days .
love ... has killed more than any disease .
this cure is a gift .
what &apos;s your price ?
these &apos;ll do .
what do you need of my hair ?
what do you need of it now it &apos;s been plucked from your head ?
do we have a deal ?
i thought so .
drink it in good health ,
snow white .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s fine . don &apos;t worry about it .
i wasn &apos;t looking .
clearly .
oh . is this yours ?
yes , thank you .
um , this must ...
good luck .
thank you .
i trust you &apos;ll be discreet .
their lives are their business , not yours .
james .
how goes the feast ?
your absence is felt .
it is , after all , in your honor .
i thought this might rouse you from your chamber .
you could feed the kingdom for an entire winter with that crown .
it &apos;s a gift from king midas ,
for you to wear as you marry his daughter .
once that is done , our new prosperity
will allow us to feed the kingdom for all eternity .
show some enthusiasm .
enthusiasm wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
the wedding &apos;s in two days . i &apos;ve honored your wishes .
but i want your heart , not just your honor .
my heart shall belong to abigail .
you think i &apos;m a fool , don &apos;t you ?
your heart can &apos;t belong to abigail
when it &apos;s held by another woman ,
and don &apos;t deny it .
i know that look .
who is she ?
i met her on a journey .
we haven &apos;t seen each other since ,
but ... she &apos;s stayed with me .
forget her .
you speak as if that &apos;s so easy .
nobility was not meant to be easy .
all this wealth ,
the power we hold overerther men &apos;s lives--
do you think that comes at no cost ?
i asked for none of it .
you were chosen to be my son ,
plugged from poverty , wanting for nothing .
be thankful for that .
it wasn &apos;t charity , father .
it was the only way to save your kingdom .
watch yourself , boy .
this is a choice you made ,
a role you have taken . honor it .
there is too much at stake .
do whatever it takes to get that woman out of your head ,
because nothing is going to stop this wedding .
dearest ... snow .
find her .
how do you manage to get yourself ...
come on .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
well , the good news is no broken bones .
she was just a little dehydrated .
but i got her some fluids , and she should be just fine .
and the bad news ?
well , this is a north atlantic dove .
it &apos;s a migratory species ,
very unique among american doves .
now they tend to form strong monogamous bonds , meaning--
if i don &apos;t get her back to her flock ,
she &apos;ll be alone forever .
well , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s a long shot , but the alternative ...
she &apos;ll heal , but she won &apos;t be happy here .
i &apos;ll take my chances . thank you , doctor .
you &apos;re welcome . good luck .
mary margaret , there &apos;s a storm coming .
you really shouldn &apos;t go out there .
well , the storm &apos;s coming tomorrow , and if i wait ,
she could be lost forever ,
completely alone .
no one deserves that .
then let me drive you .
i don &apos;t need your help , david . i &apos;ll be fine .
storybrooke is seeing wind gusts
of up to 6 miles an hour .
your best bet is to stay in the house--
if you &apos;re looking to blame me for the storm ,
i think you &apos;re taking things a bit far now .
i need you to look into something , sheriff .
someone &apos;s in town--someone new .
yeah ,
i know . i gave him directions to granny &apos;s the other night .
you talked to him ? what &apos;d he say ?
he asked for directions . what &apos;s the big deal ?
who is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
i asked around , but no one seems to know anything .
there &apos;s something about him--
something familiar .
he must be one of the untold millions you cursed .
what ?
oh , you know ,
the curse , henry &apos;s whole thing .
sheriff , i need you to find out who he is ,
what he wants , and what he &apos;s doing here .
you know , as hard as you tried to find one in my case ,
there is no law against visiting storybrooke .
this isn &apos;t about the law , ms. swan .
you &apos;re gonna do this because i asked you to
and because you &apos;ll see it &apos;s the right thing to do .
and why is that ?
because he was in front of my house ,
taking a particular interest in the one thing
we both care about--henry .
i &apos;ll look into him .
dearest snow ,
i &apos;ve not heard from you since our meeting
and can only assume you &apos;ve found the happiness you so desired .
but i must let you know not a day goes by
that i &apos;ve not thought of you .
in two days &apos; time , i &apos;m to be married .
come to me before then .
come to me and show me you feel the same ,
and we can be together forever .
and if you don &apos;t ,
i &apos;ll have my answer .
well , the flock can &apos;t be much farther .
we just have to beat the storm .
they &apos;re waiting for you .
why aren &apos;t you at the stables yet ?
must i have a guard drag you there ?
and you , go with him .
king george &apos;s carriage must be spotless
for tomorrow &apos;s journey .
flowers for prince james from the kingdom of midas .
top of the northeast spire .
take the service stairwell , or the guards
will toss you over the walls .
wait . i &apos;m a royal emissary .
sure , you are .
the king will decide your fate .
who &apos;s there ?
what are you looking at , sister ?
tried it all .
steel gets stronger as we grow weaker .
i am not ... giving ... up .
give it time .
grumpy .
i &apos;m not grumpy . i &apos;m focused .
no . my name--grumpy .
i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s no way out .
well , i &apos;m snow , and i &apos;ll find one .
you say so .
there &apos;s someone out there for me ,
someone i love very much ,
and i will not lose him .
love , huh ? good luck with that .
yeah ? well , what do you know about it ?
it &apos;s why i &apos;m stuck in this hole .
i had it bad .
she was beautiful as a fairy , but i lost her .
i was desperate to get her back .
so i came up with a plan .
i worked at the diamond mines .
traded all my wages to the foreman
for a diamond to propose .
but i got swindled .
it was a stolen rock , and i took the blame .
i &apos;m no thief , but they think i am .
should &apos;ve known better , but i wasn &apos;t thinking clearly .
all &apos; cause of love .
and now here i am , trapped , with no way out .
i know a way out .
stealthy ?
you ready to go home ?
how &apos;d you get in here ?
doc whipped up a sleeping gas ,
knocked all the guards out cold .
the rest are waiting with transport .
there &apos;s more of you ?
who &apos;s that ?
she &apos;s pretty .
no one . come on . let &apos;s go !
grumpy .
good luck .
i hope you get your love back .
son of a ...
give me that .
come on .
do you hear that ?
your flock .
here .
david !
grab my hand .
hold tight .
come on .
you really think i &apos;d let you come out here alone ?
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine , thanks .
where are you going ?
i came to find the flock !
and i came here to get you before you got hurt !
we have to go !
no !
doing this on foot is not the best plan .
the gate was closed .
i know . i saw .
it &apos;s too late . we have to go .
no , but the bird--
mary margaret , it &apos;s not safe .
we need to get out of here .
come on .
oh , wait , wait . stairs .
no , we sneak out through the courtyard .
no , it &apos;s safer if we climb over the curtain wall .
trust me , hiding from royals is my life .
but the courtyard is clear now ,
it won &apos;t be for much longer .
sorry , lady . stealthy got me this far .
grumpy . grumpy , wait !
halt ! those two are prisoners .
grumpy , run . we can make it .
stealthy , no !
no !
stealthy .
where is the girl ?
what girl ?
kill him .
looking for me ?
let him go ...
or this place will burn .
begone , dwarf .
go , grumpy .
now ... snow white .
we need to talk .
there !
come on .
hello ? !
hello ? ! is anyone in there ? !
it &apos;s empty .
okay .
let &apos;s get you dry .
whose cabin is this ?
are you sure it &apos;s okay for us to be in here ?
well , you &apos;re roommates with the sheriff ,
so i doubt she &apos;ll arrest us for breaking and entering .
here .
no .
hey , i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m just trying to help .
what &apos;s going on with you today ?
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is i still have feelings for you .
what ?
why do you think i go to granny &apos;s every morning at 7 : 15 ?
it &apos;s to see you .
i don &apos;t know why because it just makes me miserable ,
because every time i see you it just reminds me
that you chose kathryn instead of me .
and that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t want you to come to the woods with me .
because being around you is too ...
it &apos;s too painful .
you think this is funny ?
no . no , it &apos;s just ...
the reason i go to granny &apos;s every morning at 7 : 15 ...
is to see you .
how can you do this ?
what are you talking about ?
david , i know .
know what ?
about kathryn .
what about kathryn ?
that she thinks she &apos;s pregnant .
what ?
we need to talk .
why ?
because
you &apos;re suspicious .
sitting here ?
out in the open , drinking coffee ?
wonder what kind of hell i would &apos;ve raised
had i ordered a doughnut .
you were talking to henry .
you mean the little kid who came up to me asking me questions ?
is that unusual for him , being curious and precocious ?
what were you doing outside his house ?
my bike brown down . that happens .
your mysterious box-- what &apos;s in it ?
it &apos;s awfully frustrating not knowing , isn &apos;t it ?
just tell me .
why ?
is it illegal to carry around a box in these parts ?
no , of course it &apos;s not .
you really wanna know what &apos;s inside it , don &apos;t you ?
no .
well , maybe .
i &apos;m gonna make you wait .
you &apos;re gonna have to wait a long time
and watch me carry it around ,
hauling it to strange and mysterious places .
and with each passing moment ,
the mystery will become more tantalizing .
your imagination will inflame ,
but so will your frustration , never knowing ,
only guessing what could possibly be inside that box ?
or ...
you could let me buy you a drink sometime ,
and i &apos;ll tell you right now .
you wanna buy me a drink ?
yes .
okay . a drink it is .
really ?
i &apos;m a writer .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ?
i find this place provides ... inspiration .
don &apos;t you ?
wait . have you been here before ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
what about that drink ?
i said &quot; sometime . &quot;
you didn &apos;t know .
no .
and you two aren &apos;t trying .
not as far as i know .
mary margaret , you have to believe me . i--
shh .
the rain stopped . i need to get her out .
no , mary margaret ...
mary margaret , please , can we at least talk--
listen .
the flock-- it didn &apos;t leave .
they must have been waiting for the storm to clear .
okay , girl .
time to join your friends .
you can do it .
no , david .
it &apos;s too painful .
it doesn &apos;t have to be .
we don &apos;t know kathyrn &apos;s pregnant .
doesn &apos;t matter . you chose her .
i know .
i still have feelings for you .
you can &apos;t have both .
but i do have both .
i know .
i know it doesn &apos;t make sense .
i mean , it &apos;s like i have these two conflicting lives--
memories of feelings for her ...
and real feelings for you .
who &apos;s to say which is real ?
i can &apos;t get you out of my head .
i know . me , too , but ... we &apos;re going to have to .
we &apos;re just going to have to forget each other .
so ... you &apos;re the one .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re--
enough . i know everything .
you poisoned his heart ,
now his marriage .
and with that , the entire kingdom ,
all because of your feelings .
i wish feelings could be helped , but they can &apos;t .
of course they can .
love is a disease ,
and like all diseases , it can be vanquished
in one of two ways-- a cure or death .
do you know where your beloved is right now ?
he &apos;s right down that hallway packing for his new life .
and he &apos;ll never know i &apos;m here .
oh , yes , he will ,
because you are going to walk down that hallway , snow white .
you &apos;re going to sneak in
and tell him you received his letter .
you &apos;re going to tell him why you &apos;re here--
because you don &apos;t love him .
it &apos;ll break his heart ,
and that will cure him .
or you &apos;ll kill me .
oh , no .
i &apos;ll kill him .
killing you would just make him love you more ,
and the marriage and the kingdom
would ultimately crumble ,
but if he were to die at an assassin &apos;s hand ,
he would die a martyr .
midas would forgive , even laud , the death ,
and the merger would be complete .
you would do that to your own son ?
he &apos;s not my son .
james .
snow .
i got your letter .
you came .
you came . you came .
you came .
wait , james .
us ...
it can &apos;t happen .
wh @-@ what &apos;s wrong ? of course it can . you &apos;re here .
we can go . we can be together .
we can leave all this .
i know there are costs .
but i &apos;ve planned for everything . they can &apos;t hurt us .
and now that i know that you love me too--
i don &apos;t .
what ?
love you .
i don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
you said i would always be in your heart , and ...
that is too cruel a fate .
go live your life .
live it without me ,
because there is no place for us together .
and fill your heart with love for someone else ...
someone who can love you the way i never have ,
the way i never will .
anything you wanna tell me ?
what do you mean ?
something &apos;s up , isn &apos;t it ?
what ?
i feel like ...
ever since you &apos;ve come home ,
you &apos;re here but you &apos;re not ... here .
i know you say you &apos;re trying ,
and i know you &apos;ve been through a lot , but--
no , no , kathryn-
no , david , please ,
just let me finish .
i know it &apos;s been hard on you ,
but it &apos;s also ... been hard on me .
i want a family with you someday .
i want children .
i &apos;ll be honest .
i thought i was pregnant .
and when the test came back negative ,
at first i was upset , but then i was relieved .
we &apos;re not ready .
if i was pregnant now , it would be a disaster .
yeah .
but i wanna fix this . i wanna fix us .
me , too .
do you ?
well , then let &apos;s go see dr. harper .
let &apos;s get some help .
will you do that ? will you give us our best shot ?
yeah .
look , you and i ...
i know we &apos;re s--
i know we should be in love .
and i wanna make that work .
it &apos;s 7 : 10 .
we should get going if you want your coffee before work .
no .
why don &apos;t we go downstairs and have some breakfast instead ?
okay .
are you okay , sister ?
not even close .
you didn &apos;t find him ?
worse .
i lost him .
come on .
where are you taking me ?
home .
we all lost someone today .
now we &apos;re seven .
i wouldn &apos;t be here if it wasn &apos;t for you ,
so you &apos;re coming home with us , snow ,
and we &apos;re gonna protect you .
the only thing that needed protecting is destroyed--
my heart .
it will get better .
yes .
yes , it will .
this will take all of my feelings ,
all of my pain
and destroy them .
no .
why ?
you of all people should understand .
you &apos;ve lost love .
what if your pain could be erased ?
i don &apos;t want my pain erased .
as wretched as it is , i need my pain .
it makes me who i am .
it makes me grumpy .
look around , snow .
you &apos;re not alone anymore .
i promise you , that &apos;s all the cure you need .
if the pain &apos;s too much , you can always drink it .
but for today ,
put it away .
okay .
come on . snow !
snow white !
snow !
are you there ?
she &apos;s gone . she never came back after she went to find you .
then i &apos;ll find her .
i will always find her .
where &apos;s snow ? where is she ?
snow ! snow !
the royal wedding-- the kingdom &apos;s abuzz .
it &apos;s off , snow .
he left her . james left abigail !
do you hear me ?
your prince charming isn &apos;t getting married .
who ?
thanks , ruby .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s 7 : 45 .
i know .
well , i &apos;m trying not to see you .
well , i am trying not to see you .
well , how do we stop seeing each other ?
apparently , we can &apos;t .
this is a problem .
yes .
she &apos;s not pregnant .
