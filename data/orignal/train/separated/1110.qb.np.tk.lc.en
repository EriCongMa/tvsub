this is no longer a missing persons investigation .
it &apos;s a murder .
i &apos;m mr. fitz , your new english teacher .
i would never want to do anything that would get you in trouble .
wren , i need you to tell them what really happened .
i don &apos;t think it would matter what i say .
i saw the way you were looking at my dad yesterday .
i have eyes .
find someone who &apos;s available .
my dad isn &apos;t .
who is that ?
toby .
toby cavanaugh .
whisper , whisper , whisper .
almost feels like alison &apos;s still here .
ben , i can &apos;t do this right now .
get off-- !
stop it !
i think there &apos;s something wrong with me .
where are the pictures ?
first paper &apos;s due monday ,
and i &apos;ve written two words--my name .
look .
is that yours ?
it &apos;s alison &apos;s !
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t want to do this right now .
hanna .
why are you taking sean &apos;s car ?
hanna ?
i never wanted to see another police car in front of this house .
i thought we were done with that .
mom , i didn &apos;t total his car .
they can fix it .
there is nothing i can do about this .
do you understand me ?
how bad did your mom bust you over wrecking sean &apos;s car ?
okay , i did not wreck it ; i damaged it .
and , actually , everyone &apos;s being really mature about it .
oh .
there &apos;s no &quot; oh . &quot;
we &apos;re just being grown @-@ ups , that &apos;s all .
okay , so the town is gonna put in a new bench ,
and we &apos;ll plant the flowerbeds ,
and there &apos;s gonna be a pathway of art tiles .
art tiles ?
messages , pictures ,
memories of alison .
oh , like little headstones .
hanna !
what ?
we should each do a tile .
you know , i &apos;ve had alison &apos;s bracelet
since the day we found it in the woods ,
and i don &apos;t want the responsibility anymore .
i don &apos;t want it .
seriously , somebody take this .
look at us . bunch of babies .
there &apos;s nothing that &quot; a &quot; can say or do to get us into trouble
without making trouble for herself .
are you sure it &apos;s a &quot; her &quot; ?
him , her--doesn &apos;t make any difference .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna block all messages from people that i don &apos;t know--
ims , texts , e @-@ mails , everything .
screw &quot; a. &quot;
there .
who &apos;s next ?
i spy with my little eye something that begins with &quot; f. &quot;
hey , mr. fitz .
looking good , mr. fitz .
my turn .
there are teachers that you don &apos;t want to see on a bike ,
and there are teachers that you do want to see on a bike .
i would not want to see mr. gilardi on a bike .
i don &apos;t want to think of mr. gilardi in motion of any kind .
ah . mr. fitz .
hanna . your turn .
you talk to ben ?
nothing to talk about .
so you &apos;re really done ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m fine .
okay , if you say so .
i wish we had a drum roll for this .
all right , here it goes .
we are officially &quot; a &quot; -proofed .
listen .
all those little messages
zipping through the air all around us .
yep , and none of them from &quot; a. &quot;
this feels like a good thing .
of course it &apos;s a good thing .
out of mind , out of sight .
i got something for you .
i saw this and thought it was
the greatest color on the planet .
i was right .
it &apos;s spectacular .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s great .
thanks .
catch you later .
spence , why didn &apos;t your folks
take you to new york with your sister ?
i mean , you deserve some retail therapy too .
not as much as melissa .
ooh , hot scarf , em .
thanks .
is it new ?
no .
go ahead , answer it .
we know who it can &apos;t be from .
hanna .
it &apos;s my dad !
hey , dad .
has she ... even , like , talked to her dad
since he walked out on them ?
i don &apos;t know .
hanna and her father ,
it &apos;s one of those &quot; don &apos;t ask , don &apos;t tell &quot; situations .
we shouldn &apos;t stare at her . come on .
my brother &apos;s post just showed up on my loop .
you added him as a favorite ?
yeah . moment of weakness .
sorry .
my fault .
i wonder if we just bumped into &quot; a. &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;re done with &quot; a , &quot; right ?
right . yeah .
but i &apos;m still staying out of toby &apos;s way .
yeah , and jenna &apos;s .
i guess that &apos;s the safest thing to do .
there was no way i was coming back to pennsylvania
and not seeing you ,
but if you &apos;ve got something you have to do ...
no , dad , i haven &apos;t got anything .
then i &apos;ll come by , pick you up at seven .
how &apos;s that sound ?
sounds great . i &apos;ll tell mom .
um ... dad ?
yes ?
did mom ... ?
did your mom what , honey ?
you know , never mind . i &apos;ll see you tonight .
bye .
bye .
hi .
hi .
i ...
i saw you riding around town the other day ...
on your bike .
yeah . i saw you too . i waved ,
remember ?
i would have stopped , but you weren &apos;t alone .
my friends thought you had nice legs .
what do you think ?
that i was embarrassed
that my friends thought you had nice legs .
it &apos;s a little awkward under the circumstances .
aria , what are the circumstances here ?
if you know , please tell me
&apos;cause this is completely new territory to me .
yeah , me too .
maybe this isn &apos;t smart .
i promise you , it &apos;s not smart .
but we need to talk .
there are things what we need to cover
that we can &apos;t between classes .
uh , i &apos;m home tonight .
i could make you one of two dishes
that i actually know how to cook ,
but i want to talk to you
when i &apos;m not looking at you over a desk ,
or through dan farren &apos;s faux @-@ hawk .
what time ?
seven .
seven &apos;s good .
he has to be in new england for a couple of weeks ,
but he &apos;s making a special trip out to see me .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s great , hanna .
what ?
it &apos;s just ... do you think he &apos;s out here
because of the thing with sean &apos;s car ?
no , he &apos;s not . look , i asked . absolutely not .
and besides , even if he was ,
at least he &apos;s still coming out to see me .
spencer !
mr. sheldrake .
i was gonna tell you in class ,
but here you are .
remarkable job on the russian history essay .
oh , thanks .
very lucid presentation .
it &apos;s not really a new idea .
i &apos;ve submitted it for the golden orchid .
you what ? !
there &apos;s an honorarium .
but you know the real upside
to winning an essay competition like that
is how it looks on your applications .
wait , can we-- ?
we &apos;ll discuss the details after class .
what &apos;s a golden orchid ?
it &apos;s a national competition for historical writing .
more academic bling for spencer .
okay , see you later .
are you gonna be in this lab ?
starting today .
cool .
you were wearing a scarf this morning .
yeah , i was .
i took it off .
it looked good on you .
thanks .
oh , please , no . not here .
oh , please , oh , please , oh , please .
so , i guess we &apos;re lab partners .
you okay with that ?
sure .
chicken @-@ oh @-@ my @-@ gosh in the middle of the week ?
yeah , i felt like making a little treat for your dad ,
something special .
are you okay with veggie burgers ?
actually , i said i &apos;d have dinner at spencer &apos;s .
oh . okay .
and mike is gonna be out too ,
so i guess your dad and i will have the place to ourselves .
that &apos;s great .
isn &apos;t that your dad &apos;s car ?
you so totally have to tell her .
tell her what ?
aria , you just saw your dad
making out with someone who is not your mom .
y @-@ you have to tell her .
how am i supposed to tell her that ?
i don &apos;t know , okay , but you have to .
it &apos;s my dad .
don &apos;t answer .
well , i have to !
he &apos;ll try and talk you out of telling .
you can &apos;t do that to your mom .
you have to tell her , aria ,
before somebody else does .
then you &apos;ll lose both of them .
god .
mom .
yeah ?
can i have a carrot ?
sure .
i wish i had a sister smart enough to steal papers from .
using melissa &apos;s paper was supposed to be a stopgap .
if i ask sheldrake to withdraw the essay ,
he &apos;ll know something &apos;s wrong .
spencer , what makes you
so sure you &apos;re going to win the competition ?
oh , right . i forgot .
it &apos;s in your dna .
here .
try this one .
this has to be the perfect outfit .
my dad hasn &apos;t seen me since i lost the weight .
that jacket &apos;s really not you .
then it &apos;s perfect .
spencer .
what ?
have you peeked ?
we blocked whoever it was , and that &apos;s it .
united front , remember ?
no , no , yeah , i know .
i just wondered if you &apos;d peeked .
no .
yeah . me neither .
can i talk to you for a sec ?
look .
great , you found them . where were they ?
in my chemistry book .
did you put them in there ?
just tell me if you did ,
i won &apos;t be angry .
what &apos;s there to be angry about ?
i think we look cute .
did you put them in my book ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
emily ...
it &apos;s no big deal .
somebody must have grabbed them at the party .
that somebody saw these .
this is us--
you and me-- kissing .
understand ?
maya .
i have to get back to work .
hanna .
dad .
oh , my god , there &apos;s barely enough left of you to hug .
i missed you .
i missed you too .
i &apos;ll get my bag .
hello , tom .
ashley . how are you ?
good .
good .
so , you ready to go ?
yep .
uh , ash ...
think maybe we got our wires crossed about tonight .
my idea was that this would be a good time
for me to catch up with hanna .
i guess i must have misunderstood .
my mistake .
does that work for you , honey ?
just you and i tonight ?
yeah .
okay .
not too late , tom .
sure .
bye , mom .
bye .
have a good time .
that &apos;s a new car ,
so i hope you don &apos;t mind if i drive , do you ?
hanna ?
this is about sean &apos;s car .
mom did call you .
it &apos;s a little more complicated than that .
well , let me uncomplicate it for you .
if you came here to yell at me ,
let &apos;s just go back inside and get it over with .
or , you know what ? why don &apos;t you yell at me right here
so all the neighbors can watch me take my medicine ?
i didn &apos;t come back to yell at anybody .
i came back to help you through a rough spot .
you &apos;re a good girl , hanna .
you &apos;ve always been a good girl .
you can get a little ... overenthusiastic .
i remember you as a great tree @-@ climber .
the problem was ,
you &apos;d sometimes need some help to get back down .
we &apos;ll get through this .
i promise .
now , if you want to go to dinner , we can go to dinner .
if you want to go to the shooting gallery of the jolly roger ,
we can do that .
whatever you want . okay ?
yeah . okay .
miss .
do you use this ?
as a paperweight .
mostly it &apos;s to remind myself
that there was literature before laptops .
what do you think ?
it &apos;s nice .
yeah , i like it . thanks for asking me .
you &apos;re welcome .
how are things at home ?
fine .
um ... my mom and dad are having a date night .
mm . well , maybe they &apos;re working things out .
they can have all the alone time in the world ,
but she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s gonna be miserable when she finds out .
aria ,
has it ever occurred to you
that maybe your mom knows more about this than you think ?
no . she doesn &apos;t know . that &apos;s the worst part .
well , almost the worst part .
well , it &apos;s possible that your parents have come
to some sort of understanding that you don &apos;t know about .
no , it &apos;s not possible .
what do you mean , an &quot; understanding &quot; ?
okay , um ...
when i was 12 , my parents broke up ,
and it threw my brother and me for a loop .
i found out later they &apos;d both been cheating .
they worked through their infidelity ,
it was just something else that killed the marriage .
but that &apos;s your family , not mine .
what are you trying to tell me ?
i &apos;m just saying
that even though your dad put you in this position ,
it &apos;s not your problem to fix .
i &apos;m not trying to fix it . i &apos;m trying to deal with it .
but they are the ones that should be dealing with this .
what you can &apos;t see now is that
your parents need to figure it out for themselves , like adults .
like adults ?
right .
like i &apos;m not mature enough to deal with this ?
i @-@ i didn &apos;t say that .
yeah , i think that &apos;s exactly what you said .
you said i am a child
and i should mind my own business .
i guarantee you that &apos;s not what i said .
well , if i &apos;m such a child ,
why did you ask me here ?
i asked you here because
i don &apos;t see you as a child ,
and that &apos;s exactly why we need to figure out
what &apos;s going on between us .
okay . just leave my parents out of it .
you came to me about your father . do you remember that ?
you know , i , um ...
i think i made a mistake coming here .
i don &apos;t think you did .
i do .
it &apos;s not something an adult would have done .
it was great .
incredible , really .
where &apos;d your dad take you ?
jolly roger &apos;s .
what , the lame amusement park ?
okay , it is not lame .
we didn &apos;t go on the tilt @-@ a @-@ whirl .
we walked around and talked .
and i told him about what &apos;s going on .
some of what was going on , and he listened .
he wants to take me to a real dinner tonight .
he said he has something to tell me .
i don &apos;t know ,
i think he wants to spend more time with me .
i mean , maybe summers in maryland .
seriously ?
would you go ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t move away ,
not forever .
i don &apos;t want to leave my mom alone , but ...
i would like to see my dad more .
good for you .
i &apos;m wondering , is anybody else
bothered by atticus &apos; hypocrisy at the end of the novel .
well , he is mr. due process
when it comes to tom robinson ,
then as soon as bob ewell gets stabbed ,
he &apos;s willing to buy into the sheriff &apos;s cover @-@ up .
he was protecting boo radley .
protecting him ?
from what , the justice system ?
atticus is an officer of the court ,
and he &apos;s conspiring to cover up a crime .
and he &apos;s willing to let his own son take the fall
for something that boo radley did ?
it was a trade .
what was a trade ?
mr. ewell would have killed those kids .
boo saved them .
and atticus was still feeling guilty over tom robinson ,
so ... he offered jem to take boo &apos;s place ,
almost like a sacrifice .
oh . very noble .
too bad jem was unconscious .
you think he might have had a different opinion ?
no , jem would have said yes .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
he was brought up right .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. sperling ,
do you have something to add to the discussion ,
aside from phlegm ?
just ...
well , his dad was a lawyer .
he could get the kid off .
being brought up right had nothing to do with it .
really ?
the whole book is about what shapes us into adults ,
or haven &apos;t you been paying attention ?
i &apos;m just saying that she--
you &apos;re just saying that
aria made an attempt to understand this book
and you haven &apos;t .
no , i wasn &apos;t saying that , mr. fitz .
sorry . what are you trying to say ?
well , it &apos;d probably be easier for atticus to get the kid off
than to get boo off , that &apos;s all .
well , i am honored to get you two nights in a row .
you think sean will be jealous ?
i haven &apos;t spoken to sean since the party .
yeah , i was waiting for you to say something last night
about what happened between you two .
well , i was having too much fun .
i wonder if all this has a little less to do with sean
and more to do with something else .
something else ?
how are you about what happened with alison ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , sometimes i just ...
want to get away .
you know , be somewhere else for a while .
somewhere you can clear your head ,
maybe get a new perspective on things ?
yeah , that &apos;s exactly what i mean .
hanna , there &apos;s a couple of matters that we have to discuss .
really ? what matters ?
hey . here you are .
hi .
hanna , this is isabel , my fiance .
fiance ?
i am so happy to meet you , hanna .
um , and this is isabel &apos;s daughter , kate .
kate , this is hanna .
hanna .
i , uh , thought it was time we all met .
hello ?
who is there ?
where the hell are you ?
i picked this for you , from the garden .
wren , what the hell are you doing here ?
i &apos;ve come here to set things right .
you &apos;re drunk .
one does not come unfortified to the house of hastings .
wren , i thought you were an axe murderer or something .
i tried calling you ,
but you were blocking my number .
n--
oh , no , i wasn &apos;t blocking you , i just ...
did you break through the back door ?
i had difficulty locating the front of the house . i &apos;m sorry .
wren .
go . now .
i &apos;ve thought of nothing but you since you came to see me .
i &apos;ve been a coward .
but that ends tonight .
i &apos;m here to take full responsibility .
summon your father .
i &apos;m not summoning anybody .
my parents are in new york with melissa .
then i shall depart .
great !
hello !
great !
your face
is very fair .
how about some black coffee ?
i &apos;ve been drinking scotch .
i &apos;d rather not mix my beverages .
okay , come on , right here .
yes .
you scared the hell out of me .
okay , i have never been so embarrassed in my life .
first you complain about me being immature ,
and then you act like that in class ,
like i needed to be protected .
and everybody knew that
there was something weird going on .
i mean , god ! what was that ?
what , were you trying to teach me some kind of lesson or something ?
because i totally don &apos;t need that from you .
and you don &apos;t know anything about my parents ,
so don &apos;t say that they have some kind of arrangement
or understanding or something ,
because you don &apos;t know them ,
and you don &apos;t know me , okay ?
yeah , you &apos;re right .
i am ?
i really ...
don &apos;t know anything about you .
i &apos;m sorry about the mess .
i &apos;ll clean that up later .
i &apos;m not talking about the geranium .
why do you think
you had to get drunk to talk to my father ?
for many complex psychological reasons ,
but mainly because he scares the vinegar out of me .
he &apos;s really not that bad ,
once you get to know him .
things &apos;ll go back to normal ... eventually .
yeah . what passes for normal around here .
i thought you wanted things the way they were .
i guess i do .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never known anything else .
i know i never wanted to hurt melissa .
yeah .
and sometimes it looks like north and south korea
between us , but ...
she &apos;s my sister .
that still counts .
well , i think i &apos;ve imposed enough .
um , you can &apos;t drive like that .
oh , i &apos;m not going all the way back to philadelphia .
i &apos;ve got a room in the edgewood motor court .
you can &apos;t drive anywhere .
give me your keys .
come on . together . here .
... so i turn around , and there &apos;s jeff behind me ,
and he is so focused on beating me
that he forgets to lift the daggerboard ,
as we &apos;re approaching the beach .
so he gets all hung up in the shallows ,
and i simply walk onto the beach and ...
take a bow .
hanna , do you sail ?
no .
oh , you should .
kate could teach you . she &apos;s a very good teacher .
especially with beginners .
i think it would be so much fun for both of you .
going out together on a boat .
seeing who &apos;s coming back .
was that a joke ?
of course it was a joke .
and this is a fork .
just so you know , hanna ,
i had a chat with sean &apos;s father ,
and everything &apos;s gonna work out .
you talked to sean &apos;s dad ?
mm @-@ hm .
he , uh , gave me an estimate on the damage you did to his car ,
and we agreed to settle things
without getting the insurance companies involved ,
so i &apos;ll write a check ,
and you will work off the cost of repairs
in sean &apos;s mother &apos;s office .
sean &apos;s mother is a dentist .
well , you won &apos;t be drilling teeth .
you &apos;ll be cleaning up , doing light clerical work ,
you know , answering phones , after school and on weekends .
that could be interesting .
i am fascinated by dentistry , aren &apos;t you ?
plaque , cavities , fake @-@ looking veneers .
sorry .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i mean , as okay as i can be taking out the garbage .
i know that you &apos;re not crazy about having me for a lab partner .
no .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m cool with that .
really ? you wouldn &apos;t switch if you could ?
i understand .
you have to be careful with who you get close to .
i know people think i &apos;m some kind of freak .
i can &apos;t do anything about that .
but it &apos;s got to bother you ,
idiots running around ,
putting shaving cream in your locker ,
laughing at you , making stuff up about who you are .
i didn &apos;t say that it doesn &apos;t get to me ,
it &apos;s just that there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
like you said , they &apos;re idiots .
sorry .
you notice how much you and i
keep saying we &apos;re sorry to each other ?
sorry .
do you see what i mean ?
that other day in chemistry ...
there was something in my book .
some pictures .
did you see them ?
before i closed my book ,
did you see what they were ?
i don &apos;t think you wanted anybody to see them .
i &apos;m cool with that .
you are ?
do you still swim ?
yes , i do .
do you do it because people are watching you ,
or because you like to swim ?
i ...
do it because i love the way it makes me feel .
then forget about the idiots .
they &apos;re going to see what they want to see .
even if you completely changed everything ,
they wouldn &apos;t be happy .
they don &apos;t want you to change .
they want you to go away .
i tried that . i didn &apos;t like it .
and ...
now you &apos;re back .
yeah . i am .
see you tomorrow ?
tomorrow .
you &apos;re lucky .
my cooking &apos;s always better the next day .
i make really good leftovers . don &apos;t laugh .
no , seriously .
the pesto will get up your nose .
we &apos;ll need the jaws of life in here .
i &apos;m sorry about what happened in class .
i was mad at you for walking out of here .
it &apos;s stupid , but i was .
going after sperling like that ,
not my finest hour as a teacher .
well , you &apos;re right about me .
i am a fixer when it comes to my family .
i &apos;m the one planning and negotiating and ...
just trying to keep us together and keep things solid .
what are you afraid of ?
that things will change .
but ...
that &apos;s not really helping , is it ? it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s just trying to keep things frozen .
it &apos;s human nature to try and hold on to things .
i feel like my aunt ruth .
she had her pet cat stuffed when he died ,
and you &apos;d walk in her house , and ...
there &apos;s mugsy on the piano .
he &apos;s there , and she talks to him .
there &apos;s really not much difference
between mugsy alive and mugsy stuffed .
i mean , he &apos;s a cat .
aunt ruth , she &apos;s really happy ,
but ... the rest of us are just kind of creeped out .
i can &apos;t fix this .
and , if it &apos;s gonna be fixed
if then they &apos;re just gonna have to do it themselves .
all i can do is tell the truth .
otherwise , i could lose the both of them .
i have to go .
do you need help cleaning up ?
you could ... stay .
no , i have to go talk to my mom .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
how are you gonna get home ?
don &apos;t worry about me .
i was telling the truth .
about wishing i &apos;d met you first .
come inside .
i &apos;ve done some pretty stupid things lately .
i &apos;m way over my limit .
good night , spencer .
bye , wren .
and from the request line ,
this next one goes out to hanna ,
from her best friend , &quot; a. &quot;
here you go , hanna .
i don &apos;t need you anymore
okay , whatever you &apos;re thinking ,
it &apos;s not what you think .
hanna .
we are so out of our league .
hi .
don &apos;t know what i &apos;m supposed to do right now ,
hug you or shake hands ?
i mean , there might be all sorts of security cameras around .
sorry .
don &apos;t say that .
you have ...
every right to be mad at me .
i &apos;m not mad at you .
i was wrong to jump on you about the pictures .
is this about the pictures , or ...
is it about the kiss ?
i liked the kiss ,
but i don &apos;t know what that kiss means .
you spend too much time thinking about what things mean--
a kiss , a picture ,
a scarf .
there &apos;s so much going on in my head right now .
i &apos;m just trying to figure out the right thing to do .
what do you need ,
right now ?
a little time . some space .
not just with you , but with my mom , with everybody .
we can get some space here .
it &apos;s okay .
thanks .
good night .
i care about you .
so i &apos;ll wait .
you don &apos;t ...
need to say anything .
you just need to know that .
mom ?
i have to tell you something .
it &apos;s important .
there &apos;s , um ...
there &apos;s something you should know .
mo
问问你女儿吧 她什么都知道 -a
what are we gonna do about &quot; a &quot; ?
i mean , he or she or it hasn &apos;t stopped .
they &apos;re calling radio stations , making dedications .
what do we do now ?
i don &apos;t know , hanna .
well , it was your idea to shut her out .
and everybody went along with it .
united we stand . great .
