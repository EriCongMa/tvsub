are you getting this ?
i &apos;m getting the shot .
i &apos;m just not getting what you &apos;re trying to do .
we &apos;re in australia -- it &apos;s on the bottom of the globe ,
so everyone here but me is upside @-@ down .
it &apos;s geography .
it &apos;s a good time to tell you --
i dropped luke on his head when he was 1 .
okay , i &apos;m up .
did you drop him , too ?
grab my leg , buddy .
here we go .
i come from the land down under .
he doesn &apos;t .
i was conceived in australia on my parents &apos; honeymoon .
it was a romantic summer night -- their summer --
on a blanket in the park .
i still have that blanket .
phil &apos;s mom left us money for a trip there ,
and when the rest of the family found out ,
they all just jumped on board .
my mom &apos;s grandfather was australian ,
and she &apos;d spend her summers
- their winters -- visiting him .
it was a very special place for her .
she always wanted me to see it .
wait -- you still have that blanket ?
yeah , silly . it &apos;s the one on our bed .
you sure you don &apos;t want some of this vegemite , gloria ?
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re missing .
ay , i don &apos;t eat anything unless i know what &apos;s in it .
i &apos;ve seen this woman scarf down a pig &apos;s nose .
sometimes , one must travel halfway across the globe
to get the clearest view of home .
this was my whole flight .
what &apos;s she talking about ?
my college @-@ application essay .
they want students who are worldly .
oh , why don &apos;t you write about our trip to hawaii
when you drank straight from a coconut ?
i feel like harvard &apos;s gonna get
a lot of those , so ...
hey , guys , i just wanted to say thanks
for being a part of this pilgrimage to majestic australia ,
which was once a penal colony .
grow up .
this place was really special to my mom .
she actually left me a list of things
that she thought we should do --
visit the great barrier reef ,
see the bush ...
really ?
... and climb the sydney harbour bridge .
what do you say , mates ?
i &apos;m sorry , honey ,
but you know how i am with heights .
ah . is that why you never wear high heels ?
you guys are with me , right ?
absolutely not .
nah , i &apos;m not doing that .
really ?
no .
no worries .
that &apos;s australian .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll do that one on my own if i have to .
i &apos;m just so excited we &apos;re all here together .
actually , we have to go .
yeah , so ...
back in the day , we knew this guy from australia .
new zealand .
same thing .
he didn &apos;t have a lot of friends , and we felt sorry for him ,
but the truth is , he was kind of annoying .
he was one of those guys that was always on .
big relief when his visa ran out .
anyway , through no fault of my own --
wait , no , wait --
you announced on facebook
that we were going to australia , which is where he lives .
fergus invited us to lunch . i couldn &apos;t say no .
i could have said no .
which is why you have 12 friends on facebook .
claire , honey , i got to tell you ,
you really knocked it out of the park on the hanover deal .
oh , come on , dad . that was all you .
no , it was you .
no , it was you !
it was you . it was your baby .
this was my whole flight .
claire took the lead on her first project at the company
and scored a big one .
best part is , she beat out that arrogant gasbag earl norton
over at closets , closets , closets , closets .
i wish i could see the look
on his stupid face , face , face , face .
so , what &apos;s first ?
i think manny wants to see the opera house .
actually , it was a long flight .
i was thinking maybe just ... hang out on bondi beach .
that &apos;s a great idea , manny .
bondi beach is topless .
thank you , tripadvisor .
beach it is .
let &apos;s get this aussie party started !
oh , my god . what &apos;s wrong with your mouth ?
ay ! your lips are huge !
i think you &apos;re allergic to the ve @-@ he @-@ mi @-@ te .
no worries .
i &apos;d be a little worried .
my mom said that joe is fine ,
he ate , he slept , he woke up , and then he ate again .
classic joe .
so , uh , luke and i are gonna take a break from the sun .
yeah . we &apos;re kind of tired .
tired of not seeing boobs .
watching the natives take nourishment from their land
has made me acutely aware of the fact
that i am just saying words now .
what is wrong with me ?
i &apos;m totally blocked .
so am i. scooch .
how &apos;s it going ?
why weren &apos;t you all over that ?
he &apos;s totally gorgeous .
this country &apos;s number @-@ one export is hot surfers .
i &apos;m not gonna buy the first one i see .
i &apos;m still browsing .
ooh ! kangaroos ! i &apos;m going to buy one .
lily , what did i just say ?
i don &apos;t know . something about shoes , probably ?
your dad gave you enough money for one souvenir .
don &apos;t buy the first thing you see .
you &apos;ll regret it your whole trip .
you &apos;re right .
i have enough regret .
you got to be kidding me .
we got outbid !
what ? by whom ?
i &apos;ll give you four guesses .
damn it .
wait a second .
they &apos;re giving us 48 hours to submit a new bid .
we can do that .
we can totally do that .
let &apos;s go back to the hotel and figure it out .
can it wait ?
yeah , we &apos;re on vacation .
oh , sorry , guys . we have to do this .
this is my baby .
jay .
dad !
claire .
gloria .
fine ! you two go back to work .
phil and i , we &apos;re going to walk to the ocean ,
and we &apos;re going to have more fun without you .
yeah , we will .
no , we won &apos;t . not at all .
why would you guys even say that ?
so , after sitting there for 40 minutes ,
i tell the waitress ,
&quot; i &apos;m actually in a hurry .
any chance of getting the eggs
before they turn into chickens ? &quot;
you know ? and she &apos;s a total bogan .
she &apos;s like , &quot; i &apos;ve got five tables ! &quot;
you know how they have the tray ?
she &apos;s sashaying with the legs .
&quot; oh , who &apos;s got the waffles ? !
who-- who &apos;s got the waffles ? ! &quot;
all right , we get it . we get it .
people are looking .
oh , nothing i can do to stop that .
well , i can think of one thing .
well , listen , fergus , it has been great catching up ,
yes .
but we really have to spend some time with our family today .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m so sorry . um , mr. anderson ?
we are huge fans .
could we get a picture ?
of course . come on .
bring it in .
sit down there . there you go .
i won &apos;t get up .
what &apos;s happening ?
i don &apos;t know . google him .
i didn &apos;t spring for an international data plan .
thank you so much .
you like that ? all right .
oh , my god !
hey , remember your old downstairs neighbor
that could put his entire fist in his mouth ?
cam .
i think my fist got bigger .
wait . fergus ,
you have your own show ?
yeah . it &apos;s just a little talk show .
no big deal .
it &apos;s a big deal here , i suppose ,
but yeah .
it &apos;s a shame you guys have got to leave so soon .
oh , well , you know ,
we could stay for a little bit longer .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
that &apos;s fine .
you never finished the story about the waitress and the ...
yeah , with the ...
&quot; who had the waffles ? ! &quot;
waffles ? !
waffles ? !
i just feel bad that claire and jay
are missing such a beautiful day in this gorgeous country ,
which is also a continent .
you have a lot of facts .
i think this spiritual journey of yours is a wonderful thing .
i think it &apos;s gonna make you feel closer to your mother .
i hope so .
i miss her .
it &apos;s the biggest reason i came here -- to connect .
is that weird ?
not at all .
i talk to my late grandmother all the time .
she would have loved this place .
i wonder if she &apos;s here with me now .
no , she doesn &apos;t like to fly .
isn &apos;t it wild that my mom and dad made footprints
in this very sa-- aah !
what ? !
something bit me !
jellyfish !
what is this ?
not one topless woman .
calm down .
you &apos;re gonna spook the boobs .
uh , wait -- 2 : 00 .
hey , luke !
luke ! how deep is it ? !
be cool ! we don &apos;t want to look like idiots !
i lost my bathing suit !
manny , help me find it !
i don &apos;t have my nose plug !
little boy , are you okay ?
manny , say something !
miss ! miss ! he lost his bathing suit !
oh , honey , i can help you find it . it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m fine !
the water &apos;s really clear .
i love your limo !
you don &apos;t think it draws too much attention to me ?
what are you talking abo @-@ o @-@ o @-@ o @-@ o @-@ ut ? !
no .
we ended up spending a little more time with fergus
than we planned .
which , honestly , felt like growth to us ,
yes .
because i think
sometimes we judge people before we get to know them .
i cannot believe they let us in here .
how famous are you ?
well , sometimes , i feel like i &apos;m the one in the zoo .
only difference between me and this guy
is i won &apos;t pee on you .
right ?
seriously , they will pee on you .
oh , for real ? he will pee on us ?
okay .
is that so ?
turns out , we have a lot in common .
for example , we all hate standing in lines .
make sure i get copies of those .
isn &apos;t he funny ?
we &apos;re with him , so we &apos;re just gonna ...
come on . through you go .
sorry . classic fergus ,
getting us in like this .
cam .
where &apos;s the next gift shop ?
i cannot look at another souvenir , lily .
you did this .
lily , relax .
you &apos;ll find the perfect one .
i want to believe you ,
but that lifeguard was the cutest boy i &apos;ve ever seen .
i know .
hey , guys !
found &apos; em in the business center .
come on . we got to catch the bus to the bush .
what time did you wake up ?
5 : 00 a.m. claire has an incredible work ethic .
she &apos;s like a young me .
yung @-@ mi was our accountant from korea .
died at her desk .
okay , enough work .
it &apos;s time to enjoy our vacation .
yeah .
yeah , we just got to finish up a few quick , little thi--
no , you &apos;re done .
done . we &apos;re done .
let &apos;s go .
jay , i miss you .
and besides , i don &apos;t know that i can keep phil safe anymore .
i think he &apos;s going to die here .
oh , it &apos;s fergus .
what ? why did he text you and not me ?
he invited us to a party today on hugh jackman &apos;s yacht .
what ? ! not today ! no !
i want to meet hugh jackman !
i do , too . i do , too .
but , you know , w @-@ we can &apos;t bail on my family again .
that makes us complete star you @-@ know @-@ what @-@ ers .
plus , cam , this will be fun , too .
everybody have their sunscreen and bug spray ?
i got the snakebite kit .
hey , guys , we just got some really bad news .
yeah , so ...
walking the paths once trod by the first australians
has made me ... what ?
unbearable ?
now , if we &apos;re lucky ,
we &apos;ll see some of australia &apos;s more famous indigenous species --
kangaroo , dingoes , koala .
quick question .
oh , good -- another one .
isn &apos;t it true that baby kangaroos , or -- or joeys ,
are born without hind legs ?
yes .
once again , you &apos;ve correctly answered your own question .
i just got a text from earl at closets , closets , closets --
i know what it &apos;s called , dad .
listen to this -- &quot; better luck next time . ha ha . &quot;
he always knows what to say to get my goat .
i &apos;m waiting for a quote from the lumber supplier ,
but this hike is three hours -- i &apos;m gonna lose signal .
let &apos;s go back .
dad , we can &apos;t just up and leave without a plausible reason wh--
claire &apos;s hurt !
what happened ?
well , you know what a klutz she is .
honey , are you okay ?
not really .
yeah , well , i -- let me get her back to camp .
we &apos;re just gonna slow you down .
come on , sweetheart .
yeah , you guys have fun .
how dumb do they think we are ?
sometimes , claire leaves me pictures of food
instead of a shopping list .
i &apos;m so nervous .
are we gonna see hugh jackman in a bathing suit ?
what do we say to hugh jackman in a bathing suit ?
oh , my god . it &apos;s so big .
that &apos;s a bit direct , but , you know , he might be flattered .
oh , you &apos;re talking about the boat .
fergus !
fergus !
oh , guys . thank god you &apos;re here .
just had the worst fight with hugh .
oh , no . what happened ?
i took a shot at russell crowe in &quot; les mis . &quot;
hugh took offense .
oh , well , he has to know
russell was horribly miscast .
he has to know .
horribly miscasted .
it &apos;s not his fault .
it &apos;s not his fault .
he was -- the acting was fine , but --
okay , let &apos;s get on this boat and fix this .
yep . fix it.come on .
that &apos;s not the boat .
they &apos;ve already gone .
hugh was standing on his deck in a skimpy , little bathing suit ,
disappointed look on his face .
wait . i &apos;m s-- wait . whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . skimpy ?
i &apos;m sorry -- standing on his what ?
on his deck .
of the boat . got it . okay .

are you okay , phil ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i just wish claire was here to see all this .
plus , my foot &apos;s twice its normal size ,
and the mosquitoes are really going after my jellyfish bites .
look ! a sign !
what ?
you wanted to see a kangaroo , and now you see one .
i think this is your mother trying to tell you
that the rest of the trip is going to be magical , phil .
that is so my mom ,
to say it with a kangaroo .
look .
so beautiful .
okay , but be careful . you &apos;re gonna scare him .
g &apos;day , mate .
hey , aren &apos;t you gor--

wait . what if there &apos;s a better one later ?
let &apos;s keep looking .

i freaked out when those things came at us .
i think i could &apos;ve handled one ,
but they ganged up on me .
hey , boys .
how would you like to participate
in an aboriginal walkabout ?
no , thanks . why don &apos;t you ask those girls over there ?
this walkabout &apos;s for men only .
trust me -- we &apos;re not men .
sounds like you need this more than anyone .
quick -- come here .

you have got to be kidding me .
okay , can we walk to the bush ?
nah . dispatch is sending a cab in an hour .
an hour .

no , cam , we deserve this .
we deserted our family , we abandoned our daughter ,
and for what ?
we &apos;re not just star you @-@ know @-@ what @-@ ers .

&quot; friend &quot; ? really ?
yeah .
our cab broke down ,
and we are trying to get to our daughter --
the daughter my friend and i have together .
well , that ain &apos;t right .
daddies should be with their little girls .
seriously , where can i get a pair of them shoes ?
he wants your shoes . give him your shoes .
what ? all right .
i don &apos;t want your shoes . i want to get me own .
he doesn &apos;t want your shoes . put your shoes on .
i knew it !
gloria , don &apos;t be mad .
too late !
i know this looks really bad ,
but you have to understand that this is my --
your baby ? ! i know .
and you should be ashamed of yourself !
you have a husband who is on a spiritual journey
and was punched by a kangaroo !
what ? !
gloria !
honey , i just heard .
how did you get punched by a kangaroo ?
really hard .
in the face .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
oh , boy .
is there anything i can do ?
could you stop working and sit with me for a while ?
yes , of course i can .
thank you .
okay . be -- be soft .
okay . thank you . aw , baby .
oh , my god . phil .
honey !
phil ! a wild dog took my laptop !
因女婴尸体从未找到 母亲曾被怀疑是凶手
seems like a missed opportunity .
honey , if you want to work , just say so .
no ! it happened ! it just happened !
i didn &apos;t see anything .
i didn &apos;t see you get hit in the face by a kangaroo ,
but i believe you .
come on ! help me get it !
no ! you &apos;re on your own !
like i &apos;ve been this whole trip !
for god &apos;s sakes !
gloria , stop ! let me explain !
fine -- but the explanation better not be
that this is an important account and you &apos;re on a deadline
and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah !
oh . well , i &apos;m gonna need a minute to think .
i did not leave joe , fly across the world ,
to see you spend all your time working !
you &apos;re missing the whole vacation !
not the first wife to tell me that .
so how many wives need to say it before you listen ?
what &apos;s that ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you .
if you were here , you would know what that is .
i don &apos;t know what that was .
but i was not going to give him the satisfaction .
damn it !
why , australia ? ! why ? !
hey , mate .
how &apos;s ... it going ? !
everything okay here ?
not really .
you don &apos;t mind me saying , you look a bit beaten up .
yeah .
i love your country ,
but your country doesn &apos;t love me back .
australia &apos;s rejected me .
you see this right here ?
that &apos;s from a croc bite .
this one here on my back --
i was hit by a tram in melbourne .
this right here --
that &apos;s an irregular mole .
should probably get that checked out .
point is -- australia is nice to tourists ,
but it &apos;s tough on its own people .
congratulations , mate .
you &apos;re one of us .
are you saying what i think you &apos;re saying ?
i think i am .
i &apos;m crocodile dunphy ?
that &apos;s ... not what i was saying at all .
is that a kookaburra , which are born blind , or --
mom ?
there you are .
dad , the laptop is gone .
we &apos;ve got to get back to the hotel right now .
it &apos;s still fresh in my mind .
i think i can just piece it together --
claire .
let it go .
what ? no !
i @-@ i poured my heart into this .
and don &apos;t you want to stick it to earl ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
go be with your family .
remember when you were a kid ?
we &apos;d take the family trips ?
i &apos;d disappear for days to work .
don &apos;t be me .
i feel like i &apos;m letting you down .
what are you talking about ?
i finally get to spend a little vacation time with my daughter .
yeah .
what is that ?
lily ! we &apos;re here !
daddies love you !
daddies !
oh , my gosh !
oh , this place is beautiful !
that &apos;s our bus ! time to go !
what do you mean ?
who are these guys ?
who &apos;s this guy ?
honey , i am so sorry .
from now on , i am all yours .
i promise -- whatever you want to do .
phil , this is not what i had in mind .
you &apos;re doing great , honey .
what is a bridge ?
it &apos;s a connecter , a supporter ,
and sometimes , it &apos;s a metaphor for the love --
oh , my gosh ! stop ! !
come on !
hello , from the great barrier reef !
that was awesome !
yes !
thank you for choosing to fly qantas
on our nonstop flight from australia to los angeles .
i feel a little guilty sitting up here without the family .
i don &apos;t .
me , either .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little rude
that they &apos;re sitting up there ?
i would never do that .
boy , you tense up fast after a vacation .
i swear , that &apos;s hugh jackman up there .
i saw him when we boarded .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s him .
oh , well , i &apos;m gonna go find out .
cam , no . cam , come on .
let him go , or none of us will get any sleep .
hey , guys . just saying hi .
&apos;scuse me .
