第六集 第十六集
we &apos;re fine , right ?
yes .
it &apos;ll come down to turnout today .
that &apos;s the thing to stress-- that everyone get out and vote .
it &apos;s too close not to .
is it really ?
too close ?
no , i ...
i think we &apos;re solid .
unless people don &apos;t turn out .
&quot; racism without racist &quot; ?
excuse me ?
oh , i &apos;m just commenting on the cheap shot taken at me
at the black business leaders lunch .
really ? you thought that was cheap ?
not for me .
i lost key support in the african @-@ american community .
it wasn &apos;t personal , peter .
so , you don &apos;t personally think i &apos;m a racist ,
but saw a political advantage in calling me a racist ?
i didn &apos;t specifically call you a racist .
you know , i see little comfort in that .
let &apos;s just get through this .
then we can get back to you using me politically .
good morning . good to see you all .
she &apos;s finally getting to vote for her favorite florrick .
mrs. florrick and her husband
governor peter florrick voted this morning .
the first couple looked confident
even as public polls have shown the race tightening .
across town , the resurgent prady campaign claim
that their internals
show the race in a dead heat .
nicely done .
perfect way to scare off the deer you don &apos;t want to hunt .
don &apos;t you mock me . i &apos;m holding a firearm .
what ?
most men prefer their wives in garters and hose .
you &apos;re late .
r.d. , good to see you again .
this is my wife diane .
hello .
pleasure . these are your permits .
do not lose them , please .
r.d. will be taking us out to the blinds .
have you hunted before ?
no , first time .
marvelous . go get some grub ,
and we &apos;ll see you out there .
so , this is the top one percent
of the top one percent of the top one percent ?
we &apos;re not gonna talk like communists here , okay ?
we discussed this .
i don &apos;t know .
i might start soliciting for the aclu .
your wife is unpredictable that way .
so , how did you get to know all these billionaires anyway ?
r.d.
they &apos;re nice guys . you &apos;ll like them .
i like change .
if i were to set off a bomb in this room ,
we &apos;d have democratic presidents for the next 30 years .
okay , let &apos;s just keep that to ourselves .
oh , my gosh .
is that gil berridge ?
no idea .
he &apos;s the king of silicon hills .
the mark zuckerberg of austin , texas .
what &apos;s he do ?
at this point ?
count his $ 25 billion .
gil berridge ?
creator of the kracker web browser ?
he and his wife are in the buffet line as we speak .
my god , there must be $ 400 million in legal fees in that dining room .
wasn &apos;t there talk of berridge leaving sewell &amp; augustine ?
i don &apos;t know , but landing him would fill the chumhum hole .
well , i am in nowhere , wyoming ,
with him for the next three days .
a perfect chance to pitch our firm .
i just need to know why he left sewell &amp; augustine
so i can play to that .
we &apos;ll get back as soon as we find something .
okay . we &apos;ll talk .
hon , when we &apos;re out there
we &apos;ll be divided up into blinds , right ?
yes , two person blind . why ?
it would be really helpful to have a captive audience .
i thought we said three days no work , just fun .
we did .
this is fun .
aren &apos;t you having fun ?
you hunt deer .
i hunt clients .
but which head are we gonna mount over the fireplace ?
here , have one .
they &apos;re good . nature &apos;s treat .
okay , uh , there &apos;s nothing more for you to do today .
so , sit back , take a nap , just try to stay fresh for tonight .
alicia , you can have one .
i &apos;ll keep you posted throughout the day .
we should have some sense of the turnout by noon ,
but the official exit polling won &apos;t be until 4 : 00 .
oh , my god !
sugar in my brain .
i know , cool , right ?
uh , how are your speeches coming ?
good .
i &apos;ve already written my acceptance speech .
i mean , i heard it was bad luck to write a concession speech .
finn !
i , uh , i didn &apos;t think that you &apos;d be here .
i was going to leave this for you at the door .
i just , uh , wanted to wish you good luck .
thank you . do you want to come in ?
would you like a donut ?
uh , no . but thanks .
jon , you know finn .
yes , it &apos;s good to see you again .
uh , yeah , it &apos;s , uh , for alicia for today .
okay , um ... i &apos;d better go .
i &apos;m gonna call you in a few hours .
okay . thanks .
can i open this now ?
yeah ! kind of the whole point .
a friend of mine gave me one of those
while i was waiting for a jury verdict .
it turns out the first @-@ person shooter game
is exactly what i needed .
oh , halo ? that &apos;s a good one !
yeah !
one second .
hello ?
mrs. florrick , i just wanted to wish you good luck today .
oh , well , thank you .
i &apos;m sorry . who is this ?
it &apos;s lemond .
bishop .
thank you , sir .
i &apos;m sorry , but it is , uh ,
a very busy day and i have to go .
dylan ?
why don &apos;t you wait for kalinda in the other room ?
sure , dad .
is everything all right , mr. bishop ?
i don &apos;t know .
i put a lot of money into alicia &apos;s campaign .
i didn &apos;t do it because i &apos;m a nice guy .
i know alicia needs to keep me at arm &apos;s length .
for appearance sake .
but i will still need her help
when i need her help .
if alicia wins , she &apos;s leaving the law firm .
yes , and going to the s.a. &apos; s office .
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna need you to be the go @-@ between for the two of us , kalinda .
i &apos;m sorry , sir .
i don &apos;t think i can do that .
yes , you can .
all right . good .
done .
oh , god , you &apos;re good to me .
if i could have your attention .
hello .
it &apos;s good to see you all again this year .
it &apos;s been an interesting year .
we &apos;ve had our ups and downs .
the republican senate .
now you know what it &apos;s like for me among your friends .
to celebrate this historic turn
i have a gift for the group .
sacrificing welfare virgins ?
i know our wives have been left to their own devices
over this long manly weekend
of testosterone @-@ heavy blood lust .
but ... no more .
i bought our lovely ladies a spa day .
ladies , if you &apos;d be so kind as to follow darla through the lobby .
uh , now , where &apos;s darla ? there she is .
wave your hand , darla .
like hell i &apos;m going .
coming , buddy ?
i &apos;ll talk to you , hon .
are you freaking serious ? !
you can chase him tonight at dinner .
you &apos;re seriously thinking
of leaving me alone with all these republican women ?
i love you , and i &apos;ll bring you home an antlered buck .
oh ... this is ... sexist !
oh , dear god .
what can i say ?
i am a proud husband
and an even prouder governor .
you look forward to working with your wife
if she gets elected ?
as long as i don &apos;t get on her bad side .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but alicia can be pretty tough .
uh , mandy , the governor has a very busy day .
are we nearly done here ?
no , no , no .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s all right , eli .
let her do her job .
you know , all those years ,
i was out running for office ,
alicia was the one that held the family together .
now , she is committed , she &apos;s focused
and she &apos;s gonna be an excellent state &apos;s attorney .
oh , you &apos;re speaking very confidently .
think she has a good shot ?
the precincts have barely started reporting .
we &apos;re a long way away .
well , as far as i &apos;m concerned , you can take it to the bank .
there &apos;s no question in my mind .
alicia florrick is going to be the next
state &apos;s attorney for cook county .
what in the freaking bloody hell is he doing ?
he just slaughtered us like blah @-@ blah @-@ blah cattle !
okay , so we set up your avatar .
wow ! i look good .
yeah , every girl &apos;s bra size increases a letter
when they become an avatar .
hey , jon , what &apos;s up ?
well , to be honest , your husband is bizarre .
how do i make her shoot ?
there . that button on the side .
he just went off @-@ script in an interview today .
he said you were definitely gonna be the next state &apos;s attorney .
okay , good .
no , not good .
uh ... jon , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m getting ...
he just depressed turnout , alicia .
he said you were a slam dunk to be the next state &apos;s attorney .
he just told every voter in cook county that
they don &apos;t have to come out to the polls !
oh .
yeah . &quot; oh . &quot;
he just screwed you .
you &apos;re five points up , but only if they vote .
only if they come out .
if they stay home , if they think you &apos;re secure ?
you will lose .
alicia , do you hear me ?
yes .
why is he doing this ?
i don &apos;t know .
we set up three more interviews with him today .
he can &apos;t keep saying this .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
can he walk it back ?
i don &apos;t know that he can .
i don &apos;t know , but remember
when i told you i think we &apos;re good ?
yeah .
we &apos;re not good .
gentlemen , again , congratulations .
and thank you for your years of service .
well , what are you doing here ?
i thought you &apos;d be holed up at home .
i was until i saw your mandy post interview .
okay , let &apos;s just take this through here , shall we ?
just move it through here .
well , you look unhappy
so i must have done something wrong .
oh , come on , peter , you know what you did .
well , i know that i gave you a rave as a leader
and as a great decider .
i also know that on a day
that i was supposed to be talking about pensions ,
i &apos;m doing crime @-@ related photo ops to help you .
so what else did i do ?
&quot; you can take it to the bank .
my wife is going to be the next state &apos;s attorney &quot; ?
yes , she is .
you &apos;ve read the polls .
what &apos;s going on , peter ?
why are you pretending you didn &apos;t know what you did ?
i do know what i did , and it was all about you , i ...
alicia , i think we should take this out to the car .
it &apos;s depressing the turnout .
oh , that &apos;s nonsense .
i mean , that &apos;s political handler speak .
it is not .
who told you that ?
elfman , to sound clever ?
people don &apos;t come out to vote if they think you &apos;ve won .
they read the polls ; everybody reads the polls .
not the polls we &apos;re seeing .
everyone knows you &apos;re ahead .
i haven &apos;t said anything that is not true .
you remember that ? the truth ?
you don &apos;t want me to win .
i don &apos;t want you to win ?
really ?
yes , i suddenly just realized .
you want to be the only winner in the family .
alicia , i have done nothing for the last three months
but work to get you elected .
yes , like banging ramona .
okay , let &apos;s discuss this ...
when you specifically promised me that you wouldn &apos;t .
look , is that what &apos;s bothering you ?
then just say it . just say it .
i did just say it .
you promised me you wouldn &apos;t see her anymore .
all right , don &apos;t psychoanalyze me .
i &apos;m not psychoanalyzing you .
then give me credit for being a fan .
for thinking that you &apos;d actually be a great state &apos;s attorney .
i am giving you credit for your political smarts .
you know when you go off @-@ message .
no , no , no , i did not ...
you know when you purposefully ...
i did not go off @-@ message .
i &apos;m the governor , i have to say what i think .
yes , but you don &apos;t just say the first thing
that comes to your mind , peter .
look , if you don &apos;t like what i &apos;m saying ,
then don &apos;t come to me with all your problems to fix .
okay .
i won &apos;t .
and don &apos;t do any more interviews today .
eli , you cancel the next two .
great , gives me time to serve my state !
the thing is , the employment statistics are misleading
because everybody &apos;s only working part @-@ time .
because of obamacare .
and that &apos;s not even counting the people who &apos;ve stopped looking for work .
which is why the unemployment numbers are so low .
cary .
it was his wife .
what ?
gil berridge left sewell &amp; augustine
because his wife convinced him
they weren &apos;t attuned to the needs of a tech prodigy .
he &apos;s henpecked-- he does anything she says
just to shut her up .
she &apos;s there , right ?
she &apos;s about ten feet away from me ,
waiting to get her toes done .
i &apos;ll call you back .
get the wife , and you get the husband .
right .
hi , diane .
georgette .
you were the one who wanted to go shooting , aren &apos;t you ?
yep .
silly me .
yeah .
it &apos;s a lot of cigars and corporate loophole talk .
why don &apos;t you sit on down ?
well , you &apos;re a tall one , aren &apos;t you ?
oh , thank you .
i saw you and gil at breakfast .
i , um , meant to stop over and say hello .
do you know gil ?
no , i know jim sewell , mm .
his former attorney .
right , he &apos;s not with them anymore .
yeah , i heard .
that &apos;s probably a smart move .
um , not a good fit for a tech firm .
so you &apos;re a lawyer , too , then ?
is it that obvious ?
no , you &apos;re not jewish .
gil hates all the jews around .
he &apos;s not anti @-@ semitic or anything .
it &apos;s just ...
i used to date a jewish guy ,
and i think he gets a little jealous .
so i heard you have a lot of sway with gil .
who said that ?
darla ? she &apos;s a bitch .
oh , he &apos;s just a man ,
and men really secretly want to be manipulated .
where &apos;s your firm , anyway ?
chicago .
i love chicago .
really ?
i wanted to go to disney world ,
but my dad said maybe next time .
but we went swimming one day ,
and there was a window under water .
in the pool .
i wanted to go to it ,
but my dad said i couldn &apos;t because it was a bar .
dylan , could you listen to your music for a second , please ?
why ?
please .
just for a second .
yeah ?
uh , it &apos;s behind me .
two occupants
one black , one white .
right , i see it .
i &apos;m behind it .
this is what i need you to do , kalinda .
you see the light up ahead ?
stop at it .
don &apos;t move when it turns green .
don &apos;t hang up .
all right .
now . now .
get out of the car now ! now , move it !
you can go , kalinda . take dylan to school .
is @-@ is everything all right , sir ?
it is now .
put &apos; em in the back .
three hours into voting ,
and the lines at the polls are getting crowded .
all signs point to this being a tight race .
both camps expressed confidence
as they calmly wait for exit polls .
... really soon .
we &apos;ve been here before .
this problem is growing
it &apos;s not too late
by the minute .
and we need to walk it back .
alicia .
i talked to peter , we &apos;re canceling the interviews .
good .
no .
he needs to walk it back .
we need to get him to walk it back .
where , josh ? where is he gonna do that ?
let &apos;s not make this alicia &apos;s problem-- you two decide .
a robocall , you know , a @-@ a blah @-@ blah .
it &apos;s not too late . it &apos;s never too ...
no , it &apos;ll look like a desperate move .
it is a desperate move .
what are we talking about here ?
would you stop talking to each other
and start talking to me ?
first of all , i need to say
your apartment is beautiful .
thank you .
i just got married , i &apos;m hiring a contractor .
okay , the turnout &apos;s depressed .
we &apos;re losing a third of your voters .
you know that already ?
yes , it &apos;s throwing off my models ,
and your precincts are the worst hit .
so i &apos;m losing .
well , your margin of error wasn &apos;t so blah @-@ blah @-@ blah .
yes , yes , you &apos;re losing .
and if turnout is this low in the &apos; burbs ,
prady will win .
is there anything alicia can do about it at this point ?
in terms of turnout , no .
then come with me .
wait .
w @-@ wait , we &apos;ll need her input .
when you want her input , come get us .
who can we get to do a robocall , hmm ?
we still have the after @-@ work voters ,
6 : 00 to 8 : 00 voters .
or we could work on depressing prady &apos;s votes .
how ?
i have to talk to peter .
come on , hold that .
you know , the problem isn &apos;t even losing .
it &apos;s the wasted time .
and peter .
why encourage me to run if you &apos;re just ...
okay , you &apos;re justicegal , and i &apos;m badass kicka &apos; .
what ?
your avatar .
see , you &apos;re the one on top .
push the joystick .
why ?
to kill me .
you missed . marissa ,
i don &apos;t want to do this right now .
yes , you do .
now , i &apos;m gonna shoot at you .
hey .
yeah , you better fight , or i &apos;ll kill you .
can you get something stronger in these babies ?
uh , bourbon .
yeah , a small @-@ batch .
bring us the private reserve , the good stuff .
oh , um , excuse me , georgette .
so how is hunting and gathering going ?
good .
listen , i need a favor .
i forgot my rifle in the bedroom .
you ... i thought i saw you leave with your rifle ?
yes , i did .
but i brought the wrong one .
i need the 26 @-@ inch barrel .
this is you being nice to me .
i don &apos;t know , but mr. berridge and i are here in the blind ,
and we need the proper weaponry .
there are no words for how much i love you .
so then i &apos;ll see you soon ?
i &apos;m on my way .
hello , mrs. bishop ?
how are you doing ?
actually , i &apos;m not mrs. bishop .
tabitha gray , head of the parent &apos;s committee .
i &apos;ve never seen you at meetings .
uh , i just wanted to know if everything &apos;s all right .
everything &apos;s fine .
because i saw what happened back there ,
on the way to school , with your husband .
everything &apos;s all right , but thank you very much .
it @-@ it looked like those men were dragged from their car ...
i have to go . bye .
hey , why are you picking on me ?
because you keep exposing yourself .
use the barriers .
who &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know-- shoot him .
ah ! he &apos;s shooting at me-- shoot him .
who is he ?
some bad guy-- kill him !
what do we got here , couple of virgins ?
oh , who is he ?
someone &apos;s talking in my head .
i &apos;m your worst nightmare , lady .
keith , from idaho .
well , watch this , keith from idaho .
alicia , do you have a minute ?
well , she &apos;s a bit tied down right now , guys .
well , we need an answer on something , crazy lady .
what ?
we &apos;re thinking about putting out a robocall
to get your people out to vote .
we think we can get the after @-@ work voters riled up ,
and they &apos;ll come out for you .
damn it .
oh , really ? a @-@ are you sure you have time for this now ?
you want me to do the robocall ?
no , it &apos;s not about you .
we want to suggest that one of the initiatives is in trouble
unless people come out and vote for it .
which one ?
the privatization of parking meters .
people won &apos;t come out if i &apos;m losing ,
but they &apos;ll come out if parking meters are losing ?
yes , because it costs them money .
didn &apos;t daley sell chicago &apos;s soul to the parking meter gods ?
yes , for a billion dollars in return .
god , there is something truly sad about ...
die , scumbag !
not if we use it .
we just need you to get peter on board to do this robocall .
right now , the initiative is winning by six points .
we just need pete to convince people that it &apos;s losing by six .
he won &apos;t do it .
he will if he knows you &apos;re gonna lose .
that &apos;s why he won &apos;t .
alicia , we are at that point
where you can lose the election .
i know .
and i &apos;m the last person peter will do it for .
okay , we need someone that people implicitly trust
to record a call for us .
what about what &apos;s @-@ his @-@ name ?
uh , uh , uh , the oatmeal guy ?
blah @-@ blah @-@ blah ?
the quaker ?
no , no , i eat oatmeal .
i &apos;m old , and i eat oatmeal .
wilford brimley ?
yes .
uh , isn &apos;t he dead ?
or the president .
obama ? !
no .
him , the ... come on .
why am i the only one thinking here ?
martin sheen ?
yeah .

yep , that &apos;s her .
oh , and i was told by the driver to tell you
that the deer are being flushed .

it means the hunting &apos;s about to get good .

oh , you don &apos;t mind ?
please .
oh , great .
is this your first time ?
uh , shooting anything alive , yes .
well , don &apos;t worry , we won &apos;t make you drink the blood .
georgette warned me about , uh , your sense of humor .
she said the way to get at your good side
is to get you laughing .
is that right , gil ?
is that how we get on your good side ?
i didn &apos;t know i had a good side .
georgette said that you were looking for a new firm .
a law firm ?
really ? uh , what else was georgette saying ?
well , that you needed a bigger firm ,
one with deeper connections in politics .
and she was happy to hear we no longer represent chumhum .
and she told me how much , uh , she loves chicago .
i &apos;m sorry to be rude--
i &apos;m gonna stop you right there .
diane , boys ...
uh , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i think i might have a better line of sight from another blind .
well , is everything all right ?
yes . uh ...
i just like trading blinds .
yeah , i &apos;m good .
can you call out the all @-@ clear , r.d. ?
roger . hunter moving blinds , stand down .
roger .
did i say something wrong ?
r.d. ?
uh , well , i can think of one thing .
uh , georgette isn &apos;t his wife .
uh , she &apos;s his call girl .
kurt &apos;s talking to gil in the eastern blind .
everything &apos;s fine .
he might even come back .
i didn &apos;t know .
she didn &apos;t seem like she was ... working .
we &apos;ve been letting gil get away with that
for a few years now .
he said he could bring either a ...
a call girl or a democrat .
people voted , said they &apos;d rather the call girl .
that was a joke , right ?
no .
well , was there a vote about me ?
what about you ?
being a democrat ?
i suppose your husband &apos;s
conservative enough for the both of you .
want one ?
thank you .
so what should we talk about ?
killing babies ?
sure . why the hell not ?
we both have rifles .
let &apos;s see what comes of this .
kick that weapon to me . i &apos;m going to the top of that building .

mr. sheen , it &apos;s jonathan elfman calling .
yes , sir .
well , no , i &apos;m with the florrick campaign now , sir ,
and we were hoping maybe you &apos;d record a robocall for us today .
mr. whitford . hi .
i &apos;m a campaign adviser for alicia florrick .
you &apos;ve been a big supporter , and we were hoping that ...
he &apos;s suggesting one of the other cast members .
who ?
uh , melissa fitzgerald .
one of the secretaries .
ooh , the one who died .
what ? no .
no , i mean died on the show .
i don &apos;t know . should i call ?
i mean , it &apos;s not as impressive as the fictional president .
the fictional dead secretary to the fictional president ?
2 : 30 . we need someone . call .
okay . mr. sheen , you know ,
we &apos;re gonna take you up on that advice .
支持妇女堕胎的权利
the supreme court has upheld a woman &apos;s right to choose since 1973 .
ah , the great , wise body .
and they &apos;ve done so repeatedly
and with scalia and alito on the court .
you know , once upon a time the court also upheld dred scott .
成为南北战争的关键起因之一
oh , god ! do you realize every other western democracy
mocks us for still having this debate ?
&quot; simili autem modo neque mulieri
pessum abortivum concedam ... &quot;
so now we drag out the latin .
i mean , the original hippocratic oath
orders doctors to swear by apollo .
are we to do that now ?
a woman who knows her latin .
i &apos;m impressed .
yes , a woman
who should have the right to choose .
notice the word .
have you ever seen a five @-@ month @-@ old fetus ?
no .
have you ever seen a woman dead from a backstreet abortion ?
yep .
and i have seen a five @-@ month @-@ old fetus .
but i also know that science gives that fetus
20 % to 35 % survival rate at five months , all right ?
in other words , at the same moment , any woman in america ...
and the world .
and the world , can get an abortion ,
science gives that infant a 30 % chance of survival .
so what ?
abortion is murder ?
at six months ,
survival rate goes up to 50 % .
so , you would put women in jail ?
come on , imprison them ?
i &apos;m not saying that .
yes , you are . what is the option ?
admit the facts .
don &apos;t look away from the aborted fetus .
look at it .
why is it not a baby ?
and @-@ and why are we kitchifying
good word .
these babies and ... thank you .
kitchifying babies and turning &apos; em
into these cute little raphael cherubs ,
at the same time , we &apos;re aborting 1.2 million of them a year ?
because it &apos;s legal ,
and because you still haven &apos;t answered the question .
what are the options ?
i don &apos;t need an option .
it &apos;s not up to me to have an option .
because you &apos;re a man .
come on . that &apos;s beneath you .
no , it &apos;s not , because i just said it ,
and you still haven &apos;t answered .
look , bottom line , i like people .
i like you .
i mean , you seem smart , i think .
i don &apos;t know why that next fetus wouldn &apos;t turn into you ,
or me ,
and what would be lost to the world
if it were to be aborted .
would you guys shush ? ! here they come !
here they come .
voters are motivated by their self interests .
they &apos;re going to cast their vote for the candidate ...
are you looking for dylan ?
he &apos;s inside ... with the headmaster .
why ?
attention , students .
hey , dylan ?
what &apos;s going on ? you &apos;re late .
dad .
but this is not up for discussion .
we &apos;ve decided to counsel dylan out of the school .
this is not a good fit .
his grades are stellar . his fees are paid .
i &apos;m not seeing a problem here .
i &apos;m sure you do see the problem , mr. bishop .
we cannot endanger
the other students with your son &apos;s presence .
look , dylan , why don &apos;t we head home ?
your dad will meet us there .
hi .
do you remember me ?
i &apos;m melissa fitzgerald .
i played miss landingham on west wing .
it &apos;s &quot; the &quot; west wing , and mrs. landingham ,
and i didn &apos;t play mrs. landingham on the west wing .
yes . sorry . we knew that .
sorry . uh , uh , uh , it was an earlier draft ,
and we had to fire her , an intern .
but we want you .
you sure ?
oh , yes .
we &apos;re gonna send you a blah @-@ blah , a corrected draft .
right , marissa ?
uh , yes , mr. mariner .
i will . here i go , doing that .
i played carol on the west wing .
&quot; i know that if you &apos;re anything like me ,
you hate overpaying for parking . &quot;
i don &apos;t drive .
you don &apos;t ? nope , i take ubers .
do you want me to say ,
i know if you &apos;re anything like my friends , you ...
uh , miss landingham ...
or fitzgerald ,
as good as this is all going ,
i have to take this phone call .
it &apos;s the , you know , the exit polling , so ...
what about the morning @-@ after pill ?
it &apos;s proven , it &apos;s effective .
right there . you see it ?
yes .
we got the line of sight . it &apos;s all yours . take a shot .
i @-@ i can &apos;t . not like this .
come on .
it &apos;s a pest . deer are a hazard .
they carry ticks . they &apos;re overpopulated .
if you don &apos;t take the shot , i will .
it &apos;s just grazing . it &apos;s not doing anything .
would you do it if it were charging you ?
there you go . it &apos;s on the move .
take it down ! take it down ! if you don &apos;t , i will !
alicia florrick is going
to be the next state &apos;s attorney for cook county .
that was governor peter florrick earlier today saying things
he may end up regretting as we keep a close watch ...
okay , tell me what &apos;s gone wrong .
we got the first batch of exits .
you know how we talked about this being a turnout election ?
yeah . prady &apos;s hitting his numbers and then some .
we &apos;re not .
so what does that mean ?
it means you should start working on your concession speech .
come on , it &apos;s not over .
please . i &apos;ve been around politics long enough to know
if you &apos;re chasing robocalls ,
hoping to get a last @-@ minute push at the polls ,
you &apos;re doomed .
not until the last vote is cast .
finn , really , i &apos;m okay with it .
alicia .
i &apos;m serious .
most first @-@ time candidates don &apos;t succeed , right ?
you ran a great race .
no .
i didn &apos;t .
the right man &apos;s winning .
well , did you write a concession speech ?
i did that months ago .
it was the first thing i did after declaring .
and the thing is , losing is actually a relief .
well , then ,
congratulations .
i just told elfman that i wouldn &apos;t do the robocall .
i think you should reconsider .
alicia &apos;s defeat could be a major embarrassment .
i can already hear the pundits laying blame ,
replaying the sound bite of you saying she &apos;s the next s.a.
eli , i cannot do that robocall .
it &apos;s stupid , it &apos;s obvious .
okay .
then what ?
is that , uh ... mine ?
congratulations .
good shot .
you all right ?
oh , yes .
it &apos;s just meat . we eat it every day .
yes , and someone else kills it
in some godforsaken slaughterhouse
while ...
i killed it ... in nature .
but , uh ...
you don &apos;t need to do it again .
you don &apos;t need to hunt .
you don &apos;t understand .
i liked it .
sorry .
we &apos;ve got good news and better news .
first off , gil berridge is definitely in play .
he axed sewell &amp; augustine
because he felt like they were taking on too many cases with conflicts .
yeah , thanks , but i think
gil berridge may be a non @-@ starter .
what did you do , diane ?
or what didn &apos;t you do ?
too long and complicated .
what &apos;s the other news ?
well , it turns out the fourth richest man
in america is at your little shindig .
who ?
reese dipple . he &apos;s right behind bill gates ,
warren buffett and larry ellison .
reese dipple ?
yeah , you don &apos;t hear about him
because his conglomerates are all unsexy businesses ,
like industrial gases , pulp and paper .
he mostly gives to anti @-@ choice causes .
r.d. ?
yeah , did you meet him ?
uh , what does he look like ?
he doesn &apos;t like being photographed ,
so we don &apos;t have anything recent .
all right , i &apos;ll call you back .
welcome back to coverage of the cook county ...
i need to talk to you about something .
sure .
you want something else ?
no , it &apos;s fine .
this is the third school dylan has had to leave .
look , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find a good school .
mm . and that school will ask him to leave .
my life is strangling any chance of him living his .
you &apos;re being followed , kalinda .
what ?
the men we stopped in the suv ,
the ones following you to school ,
they weren &apos;t following dylan .
they were following you .
why ?
they work for the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
asa geneva pine .
we &apos;re seeing lower than expected turnout in suburbs
like barrington , northbrook , orland park--
all of which were expected to favor mrs. florrick .
for now , though , with only 46 % of precincts reporting ,
the race is still neck @-@ and @-@ neck .
until the loop and inner @-@ city precincts report .
that &apos;s where prady &apos;s voters are ,
and then we &apos;re gonna get buried .
marissa , could you please ?
what ?
will you stop it with the cappuccino ?
hey , at least i have a skill
to fall back on if this falls through .
you want my advice ?
plan something fun for tomorrow just in case .
you know , go for dinner with somebody .
that &apos;s what i do when i &apos;m waiting for a verdict to come in .
thanks .
if i drink any more coffee ,
i &apos;m gonna be up straight through tomorrow .
wait , behind you !
good shot , thanks .
don &apos;t mention it , partner .
you know what , you &apos;re right .
i do need to plan something .
have dinner with me tomorrow night .
uh , i &apos;d love to ,
but i can &apos;t-- i have plans .
look , i feel like a jerk because i suggested it ,
but , um ...
i &apos;m actually seeing somebody .
it only just started , but , uh ...
no , that @-@ that &apos;s great .
but , you know , i @-@ i can reschedule .
oh , n @-@ n @-@ no , don &apos;t be silly .
alicia , you got to get in here .
okay , i &apos;m coming !
hey , finn .
i have to go .
i will ...
talk to you soon , okay ?
uh , yeah .
sure .
northbound lower wacker is your best bet .
back to you rob .
what &apos;s going on ?
as you can see from this footage , traffic is at
a standstill in the loop because of the governor &apos;s speech .
if possible , you &apos;re going to want
to avoid that area at all costs .
he &apos;s giving a last @-@ minute , you know , speech from daley plaza ,
and that &apos;s gonna kill prady &apos;s turnout .
nobody wants to fight traffic to get to the polls .
it &apos;s gonna smother all the after @-@ work voters .
... speech about crime rates and pensions ,
the governor urged all citizens ...
you think he knew what he was doing ?
no . not after he fought us the way that he did .
he knew .
the polling stations do not close till 7 : 00 p.m.
涉及养老金 犯罪率 选举的重要性
what &apos;s the matter , don &apos;t you like our venison ?
uh , no , i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m just not hungry ...
reese ?
i never really liked that name .
aren &apos;t you going to pitch me ?
is there any reason to ?
i am looking for a new law firm .
mr. dipple ,
we spent two hours arguing over abortion .
very enjoyable hours .
i like working with people i don &apos;t necessarily agree with .
we won &apos;t argue any anti @-@ choice cases .
pro @-@ life cases ?
pro @-@ life cases , either . we won &apos;t .
give me a call on friday , we &apos;ll talk .
welcome back to coverage
of the cook county state &apos;s attorney race .
all eyes are on the candidates ...
will they call it right at 7 : 00 p.m. ?
if the numbers are , you know , trending strong enough .
here we go .
... as the polls are officially closing now in cook county .
and apparently , cbs is prepared to predict a winner
in the hotly @-@ contested state &apos;s attorney race .
and we &apos;ll have those results for you right after the break .
it &apos;s a busy night in cook county as returns
continue to stream in , and , as promised ,
we can make a call in the cook county state &apos;s attorney race .
in a race with enough star power to fuel
a dozen state &apos;s attorney battles ,
legal commentator frank prady
faced attorney and wife of the governor , alicia florrick .
and alicia florrick
has held off frank prady &apos;s aggressive ...
here &apos;s a live look at the florrick headquarters
where they &apos;ve just gotten the news .
looks like they &apos;re celebrating already .
hello .
alicia , congratulations !
oh , eli . uh , thank you .
there &apos;s nothing like your first win .
uh , yeah , i suppose so . uh ...
a bit surreal .
believe me , they &apos;ll be bursting your bubble soon enough ,
so , tonight , savor it .
i &apos;ll try .
um ... eli , is peter coming to the victory party ?
of course . we &apos;ll see you there .
thanks , maria .
so what now for frank prady ?
this has been suggested to be one of the most
heavily financed state &apos;s attorney races in the county &apos;s history .
will frank prady throw his hat
into the political arena again after this ?
his campaign has just released a statement saying
that he will be making his concession speech within the next hour .
we have cameras standing by at prady headquarters ...
thank you for meeting me like this .
no problem .
gives me a chance to concede in person .
oh . sorry .
no , no , no . congratulations .
good job .
so , what couldn &apos;t wait ?
come work with me .
work with you ? what do you mean ?
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
be the deputy .
be your second ?
yes . be my corrective .
a team of rivals ?
yes .
no .
why not ? we &apos;d be great together .
one good thing came out of our campaign ,
our positions were clarified ,
and i essentially don &apos;t believe in your approach , alicia .
i @-@ i think it &apos;s based in pessimism and not optimism .
and i don &apos;t think it will work .
but besides that ... ?
i better go .
i have a concession speech to give .
you &apos;re sure ?
yes .
she won .
i never had any doubt she would .
now i need you more than ever .
i &apos;m getting out .
excuse me ?
this is the end for me .
i &apos;m giving up the trade ,
going straight .
i need you to go to alicia and tell her i am ready to retire .
but she needs to get geneva pine to drop this investigation .
retired dealers always end up in prison .
they lose their power , they lose their clout .
everybody comes gunning for them .
i need to know that i &apos;ll stay free .
so , are you staying or going ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a job in l.a. ,
but i &apos;ve grown to like chicago .
you ?
alicia could use the help .
yeah . maybe .
but then , i &apos;ve never been a guy to stay in one place .
so you &apos;re going ?
take care of her .
