you feel like trying something new for dinner ?
maybe indian , tex @-@ mex ?
美国的德克萨斯州和墨西哥接壤
you ever wonder how humans would be different
if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals ?
okay , let &apos;s talk about that .
as you know , lizards-- cold @-@ blooded animals--
lack the ability to sense temperature .
but they do move more sluggishly when it &apos;s cold .
so , lizard weathermen would say things like ,
&quot; bring a sweater , it &apos;s slow outside . &quot;
i love my mind .
we all do .
now , how about dinner ?
oh , i would assume we &apos;d enjoy insects or smaller lizards .
体型较大的蜥蜴会以其他蜥蜴为食物
we could also pull each other &apos;s tails off and grill them ;
they &apos;ll just grow back .
my life @-@ size cardboard mr. spock is here !
i know he wouldn &apos;t care for an outburst of human emotion ,
but , oh , goodie , oh , goodie , oh , goodie .
commander spock requesting permission to be unfolded .
excuse me .
permission granted , commander .
which is why the more intelligent the monkey ,
the more feces they fling .
excuse me , amy .
penny , do you have plans for dinner tonight ?
why , you guys going somewhere ?
no , i mean just you and me .
you mean , like a date ?
not like a date , a date .
um ... o @-@ okay .
sure .
oh , no !
they sent the wrong spock !
live long and suck it , zachary quinto .
this is so exciting .
if leonard and penny get back together ,
howard and i can go on double dates with them .
how come you never invite sheldon and me on a double date ?
how &apos;s it going in there , penny ? !
just a sec .
too much ?
yes .
no .
okay , just hang on .
you just can &apos;t handle her raw sexuality , can you ?
when did you and leonard break up ?
uh , about two years ago .
why do you think he asked you out again ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he &apos;s dying .
that would be so romantic .
he &apos;s not dying .
too bad .
if he were , she could just throw him in bed
and ride him right up until he flatlines .
how about this ?
maybe .
come on .
yeah , okay , no .
do you think you &apos;ll sleep with him tonight ?
absolutely not .
look , we &apos;re just gonna have dinner
and , you know , see how it goes .
if he were dying , would you sleep with him ?
what ? !
assuming he were dying of something
that couldn &apos;t be sexually transmitted .
you know , like a spear wound to the head .
okay , he is not dying .
how do you know ? are you a doctor ?
you can make @-@ believe , though .
sometimes howard and i pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up
and i &apos;m a sexy cardiologist .
and the naughty part is i &apos;m not in his hmo network .
screw it . i &apos;m not gonna make a big deal out of this .
it &apos;s just dinner .
with a dead man .
amy , stop it .
oh , god , i &apos;m so nervous .
relax .
you know leonard &apos;s always been crazy about you .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
i know , but we &apos;ve finally gotten to a place
where we can hang out without it being weird .
and what if something goes wrong ? then what ?
guess it &apos;ll just be sheldon and me
going on a double date with howard and bernadette .
sure , we &apos;d love that .
change your clothes ; we got a lot riding on this .
i want to build a road ,
but i need wood .
do either of you fellows have wood ?
i don &apos;t understand the laughter .
the object of settlers of catan
is to build roads and settlements .
to do so requires wood .
now , i have sheep ; i need wood .
who has wood for my sheep ?
okay , how do i look ?
more to the point , why are you doing this ?
what are you talking about ?
did you forget what penny did to you ?
it took you two years and defiling my sister
to turn that frown upside down .
i didn &apos;t defile your sister , we had a relationship .
i heard you call her brown sugar .
in my book , that &apos;s defilement .
you want to know my opinion ?
oh , boy , do i !
sarcasm ?
no .
all right , then .
the reason you &apos;re fixated on
a good @-@ natured simpleton like penny is that
she &apos;s the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment :
your brilliant yet intimidating mother .
where on earth did you get that from ?
it &apos;s in her book , needy baby , greedy baby .
that doesn &apos;t make it true .
it &apos;s called nonfiction for a reason , leonard .
see you later .
if they ever make a movie version of that book ,
you know who should play leonard &apos;s mother ?
sandra bullock .
why ?
because she &apos;s great in everything .
now , where were we ?
oh , yes . does anyone have any wood ?
oh , come on !
i just want wood .
why are you making it so hard ?
so , do they have a name for a first date
with someone you used to go out with ?
oh , that &apos;s a good question .
how about &quot; awkward &quot; ?
yeah , that sounds right .
yeah ?
hey , how about if we pretend we &apos;re actually on a first date ?
see how that goes .
okay .
so , polly , tell me about yourself .
it &apos;s penny .
oh , sorry , yeah . awkward .
okay , uh , let &apos;s see .
i &apos;m from nebraska , and ever since i was a little girl ,
i dreamed of moving to l.a. and becoming a movie star .
anyway , after four years of acting lessons
and waiting tables ,
i &apos;ve done a hemorrhoid commercial
and a production of anne frank above a bowling alley .
so , you know , dreams do come true .
your turn .
uh , let &apos;s see .
uh , i am an experimental physicist at cal @-@ tech ,
most of my research is with high @-@ powered lasers ,
and , oh , i &apos;ve just gotten a big government grant
to see if they can be used to knock out
incoming ballistic missiles .
wow . can they ?
oh , god , no .
the money &apos;s pretty good .
and i used the equipment to make my own bat @-@ signal .
bat @-@ signal ?
what are you , some kind of nerd ?
not some kind of nerd , i &apos;m the king of the nerds .
what does that mean ?
uh , it means if anyone displeases me ,
i don &apos;t help them set up their printer .
you are so funny .
good .
remember that when i take my shirt off .
leonard , this is nice .
i &apos;m so glad we did this .
me , too .
so what do you think ?
are we gonna get back together ?
whoa . not so fast .
i &apos;m sorry , what did i say ?
leonard , you know i will always have feelings for you .
oh , god .
what ?
you said &quot; always . &quot;
you &apos;ll always have feelings for me .
so ?
so , that sounds more like something you &apos;d say
if you &lt; i &gt; didn &apos;t &lt; / i &gt; want a relationship with someone .
&quot; this isn &apos;t working out , &quot;
&quot; but i &apos;ll always have feelings for you . &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m sorry i slept with your best friend , &quot;
&quot; but i &apos;ll always have feelings for you . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the thing , lisa ,
i &apos;m into dudes now , but i &apos;ll always have feelings for you . &quot;
how would you say it ?
i have feelings for you .
it &apos;s the same thing .
no , it &apos;s not .
&quot; always &quot; made it worse .
you &apos;re overthinking this .
no , i &apos;m not .
yes , you are . you always overthink things .
th @-@ there you go . &quot; always &quot; made it worse .
see , this is where everything goes wrong : when we talk .
well , i don &apos;t know how you have a relationship without talking .
hey , i went out with this guy tj for eight months ,
we never talked .
to this day , i don &apos;t even know what tj stands for .
wait , if you guys didn &apos;t talk , what--
never mind , stupid question .
and now that i have some wood ,
i &apos;m going to begin the erection of my settlement .
he &apos;s got to be doing this on purpose .
ooh , 8 : 30 .
you and penny decide to go out and paint the town beige ?
you are 30 years old and you live with your mother .
i guess it didn &apos;t go well .
we don &apos;t know that .
not to a certainty .
all we know is that leonard is home .
how about now ?
again , not enough evidence .
for all we know , he &apos;s being murdered .
now , back to our game .
you were in the middle of an erection .
oh , of course . it &apos;s right here in my hand .
what does she want from me now ?
what &apos;s up ?
do not overthink this .
i don &apos;t understand .
bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup @-@ bup .
okay , but earlier it seemed like ...
no talking .
even during ? &apos; cause sometimes i have questions .
well , that was fun .
yeah , except for when i got the foot cramp .
you hung in there , though .
there was a lot at stake .
so what do you want to do now ?
well , i want to go get my asthma inhaler ,
but it might ruin the moment .
just , just help me out here .
how does a miserable date end in sex ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s complicated .
well , i &apos;m a pretty smart guy ,
and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply ,
so give it a go .
okay , it &apos;s just ,
at the restaurant when you said
you wanted us to be together again ,
it got very real very fast and i panicked .
why ?
what are you afraid of ?
well , what if we do go out
and i do something stupid and dump you again ?
what if i dump you ?
come on , be serious .
well , how about if we don &apos;t think about this as a relationship ?
it could be more like a new version of software .
penny and leonard 2.0 .
we can test it internally , shake out the bugs ,
and if we both feel it &apos;s solid ,
then we &apos;ll roll it out to the public .
so we don &apos;t tell people we &apos;re back together ?
exactly .
we pretend like our date went badly .
well , we don &apos;t really have to pretend .
and we let them think that we decided to just be friends
and that everything &apos;s cool .
okay , great .
hey , i just remembered .
i still got one of your inhalers .
i can &apos;t believe you kept this .
yeah , i was gonna throw it away , but i just couldn &apos;t .
that is so sweet .
in 25 to 30 minutes i &apos;m gonna show you
how much this means to me .
leonard ?
yeah , hi , hi .
how &apos;s it going ?
uh , can &apos;t complain .
thanks for asking .
well , what were you doing out at 3 : 00 in the morning ?
well , uh , uh ... what are you doing up ?
i was using the bathroom .
yeah , well , so was i.
really ?
i didn &apos;t see you in there .
obviously ... when i saw that you were in ours ,
i went and used another one .
where ?
the , the gas station across the street .
in your pajamas ?
yes .
without shoes ?
yes .
on a cold winter &apos;s night ?
yes .
seems unlikely .
did you bring your asthma inhaler ?
uh , uh , uh , yes , i did .
well , then , i guess it &apos;s plausible .
d-- hang on a second , mister .
what ?
after you used the facilities at the gas station ,
did you make a purchase ?
what ?
it &apos;s customary , when using the restroom
at a retail establishment , to make a small purchase .
did you ?
no .
here &apos;s two dollars .
go buy some beef jerky .
i don &apos;t want beef jerky .
it &apos;s not about you .
it &apos;s about a poor immigrant from pakistan
trying to make his way in america
by working the graveyard shift
at the colorado boulevard chevron .
fine .
needy baby , greedy baby indeed .
leonard will be here in a moment .
he &apos;s looking for a different parking space .
why ?
we were next to a car
with an &quot; ask me about my grandchildren . &quot; bumper sticker ,
and i was afraid if we ran into them on the way out ,
i &apos;d be obligated to do so .
i &apos;m so disappointed it didn &apos;t work with him and penny .
me , too .
out of deference to them ,
let &apos;s not flaunt our happy relationship .
you have a keen insight into the human heart ,
amy farrah fowler .
we are next to a suburu with a gore / lieberman bumper sticker .
well , i doubt they &apos;d want to talk about that , so we &apos;re fine .
i &apos;m surprised to see you here
after it went so badly with penny .
well , hey , we &apos;re grown @-@ ups .
we can still be friends .
boy , i don &apos;t know if i could be friends with howie
if we broke up .
why not ?
i &apos;m a very vengeful person .
really ?
with access to weaponized smallpox .
here you go , guys , let me get you going with some water .
you need menus or you know what you want ?
leonard knows what he wants ,
but it looks like he &apos;s not gonna get it from you .
howard .
no , that &apos;s okay , bernadette .
sometimes these things just don &apos;t work out .
yeah , it &apos;s all good .
we @-@ we &apos;ll always have feelings for each other .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
see , she knew what &quot; always &quot; meant .
wow , you &apos;re like a dog with a bone , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m just making a point .
is the point that you don &apos;t know when to let something go ?
people , people ,
please , before you say something you both regret ,
i &apos;d like to place my order .
yeah , just hang on , sheldon .
you know why we can &apos;t be together ?
because you always have to be right .
oh , that is not true .
i got to go with leonard on this .
he is wrong more than anyone i know .
you know what ? i just realized i &apos;m on a break .
i &apos;ll get someone else .
leonard , promise me that when our new waitress comes over ,
you will not start a complicated on @-@ again ,
off @-@ again relationship with her ,
because i am very , very hungry .
unbelievable .
mind explaining to me why you were being
such a jerk at the restaurant ?
i was trying to act like we weren &apos;t seeing each other .
that was the plan , right ?
no ,
the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends .
that &apos;s a little hard to do
when you &apos;re always being such a tool bag .
you know what ? i don &apos;t have to stand here and take this crap .
the hell do you think you &apos;re going ?
isn &apos;t sex after fighting kind of what we do now ? !
yeah , kind of , yeah .
what are we doing ?
what do you mean ?
every scenario i play out for you and me ends badly .
that &apos;s because you overthink everything .
&lt; i &gt; leonard , are you listening to me ? &lt; / i &gt;
what ? yeah .
this is a disaster .
i distinctly ordered
the leonard nimoy mr. spock cardboard standee .
why would i feel safer
with zachary quinto at the foot of my bed ?
i don &apos;t know , he was pretty badass on &lt; i &gt; heroes . &lt; / i &gt;
you &apos;re right , i &apos;ll give him a shot .
hang on .
penny , do you have plans for dinner ?
why , you guys going somewhere ?
no , i mean just you and me .
uh , have you thought this through ?
yes , and i think we should go anyway .
no , can &apos;t do it .
sorry , quinto , you &apos;re going back .
if you and leonard get back together ,
sheldon and i will finally have someone
to go on double dates with .
what about me and howard ?
fine , we can double with you , too .
so insecure .
where are you guys going to eat ?
penny ?
do you , penny , take leonard to be your lawful wedded husband ?
well , it &apos;s a little late for me
to start saying no , isn &apos;t it ?
penny .
sorry , just remembered i &apos;ve got to stop at the drugstore .
