we are so screwed .
how are we gonna memorize all this ?
let &apos;s just go over it again .
kingdom , phylum , class--
order , family , genus , species .
i use a mnemonic device .
&quot; kevin , please come over for gay sex . &quot;
why wouldn &apos;t you use &quot; karen &quot; ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s gay sex , dummy .
so use &quot; great . &quot;
now i can &apos;t remember anything . thanks !
god , why do we always wind up in this position ?
for all the time you spend here ,
you &apos;d think we wouldn &apos;t have to cram so much .
maybe we never get any work done
because we have so much fun hanging out together .
definitely , maybe that &apos;s why .
ah , the duali @-@ dean of man .
i &apos;m dressed this way because i have good news and bad news .
you have got to be kidding me .
the bad news is professor kane has the flu .
the good news is biology class is canceled ...
after you .
what a gentleman .
guys , we don &apos;t have to cram last minute anymore .
last minute got moved to tomorrow .
three @-@ hour lunch ? three @-@ hour lunch ? three @-@ hour lunch ?
three hours ?
i could watch the first half of three movies .
ooh , i don &apos;t have to go to the fast food restaurant across the street .
i can go to the fancy one across town .
their manager wears a tie .
if we don &apos;t eat , we can make @-@ believe an whole episode &apos;s
worth of inspector spacetime in the dreamatorium .
word .
yeah .
maybe we should go to senor kevin &apos;s .
britta , didn &apos;t you want to try that
new cage @-@ free bean burrito ?
the tortillas are made with micro @-@ financed flour .
troy , you could drive .
you always like that spiral parking ramp .
you just keep turning left , but you end up up !
i can &apos;t go to senor kevin &apos;s .
the manager and i are enemies .
he said die hard was bad .
he said die hard was bad .
i know , buddy .
well , how about this .
this lunch is already a runaway train , no point in stopping it .
troy , britta , you go to senor kevin &apos;s .
abed promised he &apos;d show me how the dreamatorium works .
today &apos;s the perfect day for it .
but i want to--
abed , don &apos;t you think today &apos;s the perfect day for it ?
no .
abed .
is this a social cue ?
i left my puttin &apos; on the ritz cane in here earlier .
i know it probably has another name ,
but , um , can i be perfectly honest with you guys ?
i think i went too far with this one .
i have to go to the bank today .
what am i supposed to tell people in line ?
&quot; i had good news and bad news &quot; ?
come on , craig .
get you life together .
第三季第十六集
i am inspector spacetime .
and i know that which is unknown .
duty @-@ bound to protect a universe of innocent unremarkables ,
i patrol it in the x7 dimensionizer
with my loyal constable , reggie .
this week , however , reggie has been forced to go to lunch .
so i &apos;m aboard the much crappier h.m.s. spacetime 12,
from the worst season ever , with temporary constable , geneva .
geneva , i need the quantum spanner , the big one .
oi , gov &apos;ner , quantum spammer , up an &apos; at &apos; em , in &apos;it ?
if we can &apos;t get out of orbital lock ,
the blorgons may intercept .
tut tut , m &apos;lord .
wouldn &apos;t give a tuppence for that sticky wicket .
okay , stop simulation .
more british ?
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
but the blo @-@ gons might intercept--
it &apos;s blorgons with an &quot; r. &quot;
blo @-@ gon means &quot; thank you &quot; in blorgon .
can &apos;t we play something i know about
like hospital administration ?
you &apos;re mad at me for playing matchmaker with troy and britta .
you think you &apos;re gonna lose troy .
i &apos;m not petty , annie .
i &apos;m mad at you because you tampered
with the fabric of the group .
how do you know troy and britta pairing up
wouldn &apos;t destroy everything ?
i run the scenarios .
i examine this stuff from every conceivable angle .
oh , and you can do that but i can &apos;t ?
you don &apos;t have a patent on being a control freak , abed .
i kind of do .
you think this is just a room where troy and i play dinosaurs
versus riverboat gamblers together ?
sure , it &apos;s how i got the construction approved ,
but , much like myself ,
the dreamatorium has higher functions .
would you like me to show you how your stunt
with troy and britta will play itself out ?
why not ?
execute simulation troy / britta .
render environment senor kevin &apos;s .
oh , those appetizers were dope and legit !
i don &apos;t usually support lunch
because it &apos;s unfair to breakfast .
i never thought about meals fighting each other .
i guess that explains why you never
see any two of them on the same table .
so i guess annie &apos;s pretty hot to get us together .
she probably just doesn &apos;t understand people .
well , the sooner the food comes ,
the sooner this will be over .
i &apos;m afraid your food won &apos;t be ready for another half hour .
i &apos;m too busy misunderstanding the whole point of die hard .
i can &apos;t wait to get home to abed .
so you can dart back and forth
doing impressions of your friends .
there &apos;s no science at work here .
you &apos;re right .
the science is at work in here .
this is the dreamatorium &apos;s engine .
my thoughts are collected by this box
and everything i know about my friends is stored here .
both are distilled by logic
and then recombined into objective observation .
i &apos;m able to simulate any of the study group
and even a half @-@ accurate chang in over 7,000 unique situations .
abed , it &apos;s cardboard tubes and a funnel .
well you see it that way because it &apos;s calibrated
to a specific level of brain function .
right . i &apos;m stupid .
not stupid , just less able to see what i see .
gee , you &apos;ve got it all figured out .
king of toilet paper rolls over here .
hey , troy , i &apos;m glad you called .
your lunch is going well , right ?
yeah , just checking on abed .
making sure he &apos;s okay .
what ? he &apos;s fine .
he just implied i operate on a lower level
of brain function , so business as usual .
great , um , just , you know , make sure he stays comfortable .
i worry about him when i &apos;m not around .
well , he &apos;s fine , he always will be .
people bend over backwards to cater to him .
he &apos;s just extra sensitive in the dreamatorium .
it takes a lot out of him to run that thing .
i don &apos;t want you to break his brain .
bye , troy .
how is he ?
he &apos;ll be okay .
it &apos;s so sweet how much you care about him .
and another thing i hate about die hard ,
two fbi agents named johnson
i &apos;ve been thinking about our inspector spacetime scenario .
it might work better if instead of playing geneva ,
you played rosamund .
she was a constable in season five
and she only had three lines .
i have a better idea .
you know what would make your scenarios a lot more realistic ?
if troy weren &apos;t on a date .
why don &apos;t you take all your thoughts
and your logic and add one step to the process .
what are you doing ?
from now on ,
before you do or say anything ,
you &apos;re gonna think about how it affects the people around you .
we lower functioning brains call this &quot; empathy . &quot;
abed ?
abed ?
oh , my god , i broke abed .
abed ?
you know how you wanted me to tell you
when you were being scary weird
instead of cute weird ?
this is scary weird .
hello , annie .
what was i doing on the floor ?
were we ... doing it ?
are you being jeff ?
well , i &apos;m not being a kardashian .
so where are we now ?
we &apos;re in the doctor &apos;s lounge of greendale hospital school .
hospital school ?
it &apos;s a sexy emotional school
where doctors save lives and make love ,
often simultaneously .
our stories , ripped from the headlines .
our passions , unbridled .
our cafeteria , eh ...
make love to me , ann .
i know i &apos;m just a surgeon
and you &apos;re a hotshot upstart administrator ,
but damn the rules , damn the system ,
damn our two foot height disparity ,
i want you .
okay , abed , i get it ,
we have different sensibilities .
later .
bye .
i &apos;m leaving .
okay , dr. jeff ,
can you please tell me where i can find abed ?
i owe him an apology .
abed ? never heard of him .
terrific .
i asked you a question , doctor .
i &apos;m a surgeon !
and i &apos;m your administrator !
i left my wife for you and she was pregnant !
who do you think inseminated her ?
now tell me what i want to know or god as my witness ,
i &apos;ll have your stethoscope .
fine .
dr. perry might know .
render environment bio lab .
look , there &apos;s britta and troy fooling around with each other .
look , there &apos;s abed having overcome his issues .
nice try .
dr. barnes , dr. perry .
we just saved an uninsured homeless man &apos;s life .
using an unapproved procedure .
now , we &apos;re going to kiss .
this is what you think i want ?
what do you want , administrator ?
i want to talk to abed .
there &apos;s no one here by that name
you &apos;re lying .
maybe i am , so what ?
i was raised on the mean streets of harlem .
i &apos;m not scared of you .
well , be scared of this .
sodium pentothal , known commonly as truth serum .
i saw abed &apos;s name in the hospital school files ,
i love butt stuff , i hate spiders ,
i stole a pen from the bank ,
i cried during about a boy ... the soundtrack ...
i don &apos;t wash my hands before surgery .
i can see why women find clive owen attractive to the point
where i might just as well be attracted to him .
i use comparisons to hitler to win arguments on the internet
at the drop of a hat .
i know nothing about wine .
i &apos;m more turned on by women in pajamas than lingerie .
i just want to know they feel comfortable .
i didn &apos;t get inception .
i didn &apos;t get inception .
you said you saw his name in the files .
there &apos;s so many layers .
right , render environment medical study room .
there &apos;s head nurse , shirley ,
talking to tragic , heart @-@ wrenching alzheimer &apos;s patient
and emmy @-@ contender , pierce hawthorne .
mr. hawthorne , you &apos;re out of your bed again .
&apos;cause i think i &apos;m on a train .
shirley , get me the file on abed .
abed doesn e exist , young lady .
he exists if i say so .
this is my hospital school .
your hospital school , young lady , is a simulation
being run through a filter of other people &apos;s needs .
abed &apos;s been filtered out because nobody needs him .
i need him .
well you &apos;re not simulated .
no , but this is !
and there are more where that didn &apos;t come from .
this is a private compartment .
jeff , get the files .
why me ?
because you can see the cabinets .
and i &apos;ll make love to you .
jackpot .
there is an abed in this hospital school ,
but he &apos;s not a doctor .
he &apos;s a patient .
notify security !
conductor !
jeff , take me to that abed .
where is that ?
enough games , just take me where i wanna go .
follow me .
are we close ?
almost there , although you should probably run in place
and let the hall way move around you .
here we are .
where ?
where you wanted to go .
the last night of school , first year .
the night we kissed .
abed wasn &apos;t there , so whose memory is this ?
maybe it &apos;s yours .
maybe the dreamatorium really works .
or maybe leonard was watching from the bushes
and told abed about it .
i don &apos;t have cable .
knock it off , abed .
i &apos;m not abed .
you &apos;re confused , and so was i.
but not any more .
jeff--abed stop .
i don &apos;t want to do this .
i want to talk to abed .
i &apos;m taking the file .
oh , it says abed isn &apos;t the recovery parlor .
condition--never better .
you &apos;re not holding anything .
this is the file .
abed nadir , psychiatric patient 1373,
control freak with no empathy .
people bend over backwards to cater to him .
signed , healthcare administrator annie edison .
that &apos;s out of context .
you &apos;ve thought of everything , annie .
with abed gone and troy and britta together ,
there &apos;s nothing standing in the way of us .
wait , what ?
come on .
this is you dream .
this is why you played matchmaker .
this is what &apos;s important to you .
you are not jeff .
because jeff cares about abed .
and i did not push troy and britta together
so this would happen .
i did it because i thought they were cute together
and this would have been a bonus .
and we are not here .
and i &apos;m not staying here because i hate whoever you are .
you should probably storm off in--
in place .
where do you wanna go next ?
i wanna be alone .
sounds good to me .
execute simulation , annie / annie .
there .
now we &apos;re alone .
great , so you &apos;re me now .
why are you blowing our magic moment with jeff ?
it &apos;s not magic .
it &apos;s not even real .
but we love jeff .
no , we don &apos;t .
we &apos;re just in love with the idea of being loved .
and if we can teach a guy like jeff to do it ,
we &apos;ll never be unloved .
so we keep running the same scenario over and over
hoping for a different result .
running scenarios .
careful now .
you &apos;re starting to sound like abed .
so ... i probably shouldn &apos;t say things like &quot; star wars .
zardoz , cougar town , cool , cool , cool . &quot;
stop it .
pop culture , pop culture .
i &apos;m on a tv show .
you &apos;re gonna get in trouble .
meta , meta .
it &apos;s abed !
i got an abed here !
get him !
that &apos;s it .
i find you guilty of being abed .
you &apos;re under arrest !
can i just interject and say
i don &apos;t know what the hell &apos;s going on ?
this time you &apos;ll never get out .
abed ?
abed .
yeah .
i found you by turning into you , how cool is that ?
cool . cool , cool , cool .
tell me where we are so i can pretend to see it .
we &apos;re inside a locker .
it &apos;s where i spent a lot of time in junior high .
you think this is where we &apos;d put you ?
you know that &apos;s absurd , right ?
well , i &apos;m not stupid .
you can see i &apos;ve increased the square footage .
it &apos;s a metaphorical locker .
it &apos;s a place where people like me get put
when everyone &apos;s finally fed up with us .
abed , so maudlin .
if you start turning into a vampire--
i &apos;ve run the simulations , annie .
i don &apos;t get married , i don &apos;t invent a billion dollar website
that helps people have sex .
i don &apos;t make in into sundance ,
slamdance or dance pants .
troy invents dance pants in 2019 .
don &apos;t tell him , he needs to stumble onto it .
all right , listen .
the scenarios you run in here are like
great ... science fiction .
they &apos;re impressive and detailed and insightful ,
but they &apos;re not accurate for crap .
science fiction never has been .
look at 2001 .
did we have a space odyssey ?
no , we got snowboarding in the olympics
and we over @-@ validated carson daly .
that poor guy .
yeah , cry me a river .
my point is , your simulations are nothing more than anxieties .
you &apos;re afraid you don &apos;t fit in .
you &apos;re afraid you &apos;ll be alone .
great news--you share that with all of us ,
so you &apos;ll never be alone and you &apos;ll always fit in .
and , yes , that &apos;s why i meddled with troy and britta .
you caught me .
i was trying to make life go according to some script .
i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t .
we both need to get more comfortable winging it .
at least it &apos;ll be less work .
it would cut down my dreamatorium time by 18 hours a week .
i could take up yoga .
you &apos;ve got the body type .
now let &apos;s get you out of here .
i don &apos;t know how .
these fake shackles don &apos;t have a fake key .
isn &apos;t that what a ... quantum spanner &apos;s for ?
technically , no .
but that &apos;s fine .
so should we get back to lunch ?
i guess so .
a little more anticlimactic than i would have simulated it ,
but whatever .
anticlimactic ?
render environment observo @-@ deck ,
h.m.s. spacetime 12 .
inspector , set the tachyon drive to hyperjump .
we must get to the other side of this star field
before the blorgons intercept .
blorgons in this sector ?
well , this mission has gone pear @-@ shaped , indeed .
prepare to hyperjump on my mark .
bugger the dovecoats , inspector .
we &apos;re too late ! blorgons !
eradicate ! eradicate !
our quantum blasters are useless against their armor .
we &apos;re as cooked as lord nelson &apos;s mutton , we are .
not if i can help it .
i &apos;ll see you on the other side inspector ... wherever that is .
don &apos;t you mean &quot; whenever that is &quot; ?
take that , blorgon scum !
you &apos;ll blo @-@ gon me for this later .
ow , annie !
oh , oh , my god !
abed , i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no , you &apos;re committing .
this is good stuff .
thanks .
i am abed nadir ...
and i don &apos;t know a lot of things everyone else knows .
i wander the universe with my friend , troy ,
doing whatever i want .
sometimes accidentally hurting innocent unremarkables .
this week , however , troy went to lunch and i adapted .
i now have the ability to enter the minds of others .
i &apos;m hungry , are you hungry ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll make us buttered noodles .
using an elusive new technique known as &quot; empathy . &quot;
so was the other fast food place worth the drive , shirley ?
you know , half way there i thought , &quot; what am i doing ?
it &apos;s the same fast food place in a different location .
have the margins of my life become so narrow ? &quot;
so i went to the mall and had pizza .
i be the matrix today .
sounds like this has been a game @-@ changing day for all of us .
i almost sat on my balls ,
but at the last second , i made an adjustment .
good job !
good work .
good job , man .
well , we had a good lunch , too .
yeah .
i spoke to the manager about die hard ,
and i told him he should be ashamed of himself .
thanks .
sorry i bailed on the dreamatorium .
it &apos;s okay , annie did pretty good in a pinch .
all right , back to cramming ?
the people at the bank loved my outfit .
and they had all kinds of questions about it
and my answers seemed to amuse and
-and even liberate them a little .
a few of us went to lunch
and i had the deepest conversation of my life .
i gotta go , i &apos;m telling everybody .
hmm , maybe after a long , dark night ,
the sun is starting to rise on greendale .
maybe . maybe not .
you never can tell what kind of day you &apos;re gonna have .
okay , i didn &apos;t really avoid sitting on them .
i ... sat right on them .
i &apos;m sorry .
pierce , i &apos;m sorry .
hurt like hell .
i saw eagles .
troy and abed in the morning
today we &apos;re joined by annie edison ...
hi !
who &apos;s gonna show us how to spruce up your apartment on a budget .
so , annie , what inspired this throw ?
well , i just thought that i &apos;d cover up the stain
where abed spilled code red on the couch last week .
oops . crafty .
and you have some tips on entertaining .
yes , if you &apos;re expecting company ,
but you don &apos;t have enough chairs ,
you can bring out pillows from your bedroom
and use them on the floor for a moroccan feel .
ooh , a taste of the orient .
actually , boys , i have a little surprise for you .
while you two were out playing blazer tag ...
that &apos;s laser tag with sport coats .
i did a little extreme bedroom makeover !
i unbunked your beds and got scrap fabric and--
it &apos;s okay , buddy .
we can put it back .
we can put it back the way it was .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s--cut , garrett .
sorry !
