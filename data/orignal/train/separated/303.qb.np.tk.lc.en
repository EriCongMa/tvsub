happy st. patrick &apos;s day .
会有各式绿色服饰装扮 甚至有绿色啤酒
guinness and irish cream cupcakes for everyone !
enjoy your blackout !
these are the last 12 cupcakes .
actually , two of them are just potatoes from the diner .
at some point i started
putting green icing on anything i could find .
max , we haven &apos;t been so busy since someone
spray @-@ painted free sex stuff on the wall outside .
and you said i &apos;m not good at marketing .
happy st. patrick &apos;s day .
bridget , patrick , john , mary ,
and you , the little one , come over here .
we &apos;re here to pick up our order .
huh . should be here to pick up birth control .
coming right up .
max , i know i told you i hated st. patrick &apos;s day
because the only people who go out are drunk trash--
we prefer to be called &quot; intoxicated garbage . &quot;
but that was before i knew that drunk trash carried cash .
nobody gonna pinch me today , &apos; cause i got all this green .
oh , money &apos;s involved ,
and all of a sudden you &apos;re erin go bragh ?
or in your case , &quot; erin go training bra &quot; ?
who wants cupcakes ?
it was so worth being open this morning .
we can use this st. patrick &apos;s day money
to spring for some new pillows .
or even just pillows .
or just go to a bar and fall asleep on a couple of fat guys .
okay , how much did we make ? show me the money .
$ 351 !
show me the rest of the money .
fine , i took $ 3 .
that &apos;s it ?
fine , i took 5 .
can &apos;t a bitch get a foot @-@ long ?
but we worked so hard .
i have so much green under my fingernails
it looks like i had really good sex with shrek .
what other kind could you have with him ?
green guys make black guys look like white guys .
i love st. patrick &apos;s day .
tell me one good thing about it .
top o &apos; the mornin &apos; !
look , it &apos;s a lepre @-@ han .
想抓到小妖精 绿色衣物与三叶草最吸引他
so what do you think ?
i &apos;m concerned . if you &apos;re out here ,
who &apos;s guarding your lucky charms ?
正是小妖精守着他的麦片 &#91; 黄金 &#93;
you laugh now , and probably all night long ,
but with this costume ,
my chances of getting laid are higher than ever .
so zero ?
nope , 100 % .
what makes you so confident ?
&apos;cause the only answer i can think of right now
is that you have cocaine in your wee pocket .
hey , i can see it .
you &apos;re out drunk on st. patrick &apos;s day ,
and it seems like a good idea to bang a leprechaun .
like the president &apos;s day i hooked up with a guy
dressed like uncle sam at the used car lot .
this costume is my ace in the hole .
well , it does make you look like an ace hole .
nice outfit , han .
you look like a pimp i used to use in vietnam .
come on , let &apos;s hit the parade .
look , oleg , this is america .
you could have an accent or a suspicious package ,
but you can &apos;t have both .
relax . it &apos;s just my inventory .
i &apos;m gonna sell t @-@ shirts .
有亲爱尔兰人得到好运的习俗
that is revolting .
put me down for five .
you might also be interested in my other choice product .
能得到 &quot; 口若悬河 &quot; 般的能力
pee funnels .
i might also not be interested in that product .
it &apos;s a disposable funnel for upwardly mobile , elegant ,
young ladies who want to stand
and pee in the street like a man .
i mean , have you seen those parade port @-@ a @-@ potties ?
seen &apos; em ? i was conceived in one .
just slip one of these babies into your pants
and go pee in the park , no muss , no fuss .
well , a little muss , some fuss .
and possibly a very unpleasant paper cut .
that &apos;s revolting .
put me down for five .
better make it six , &apos; cause if it &apos;s for ladies ,
han &apos;s definitely gonna need one .
max , barhopping with a horny leprechaun
and a pee funnel salesman ?
not exactly my scene .
can &apos;t you just go with deke ?
this is boyfriend stuff , meaning he &apos;s gross like you .
i know , but he &apos;s snowboarding somewhere called vail
with something called a family .
here , we gotta lay down a layer of grease
to absorb all the booze we &apos;ll be drinking tonight .
this &apos;ll hold us over till our 3 : 00 a.m. street meet ,
which &apos;ll hold us over till our
noon @-@ 30 rooty @-@ tooty fresh and fruity breakfast .
come on , start layering .
i miss my old st. patrick &apos;s day tradition .
wanna hear it ?
hell , no .
well , from 16 to 21 , my friends and i--
boys were there too ,
even though technically they weren &apos;t allowed--
by 16 , i was thrice divorced
and a member of the electricians &apos; union , but go on .
we &apos;d rent a big suite at the plaza overlooking the parade ,
and we &apos;d fill balloons with champagne and--
and throw them down at the parade crowd !
so fun , right ?
oh , wait , that was you guys ?
one year you hit me and my friend archie .
he sells car seat covers in rhode island now .
he &apos;s doing pretty well .
max , why are you dragging ass
on the night i &apos;m supposed to get some ?
stop talking about sex wearing that body .
it &apos;s gross .
we &apos;ve been stuck in traffic for , like , an hour .
i could &apos;ve had 37 guinnesses by now .
and broken the guinness world record for most guinnesses .
is this cab even moving ?
is that a new mcdonald &apos;s or the same one ?
it &apos;s the same one ,
unless that bum &apos;s on a masturbation tour of manhattan .
come on ! make &apos; em move ! hit the horn again !
if you touch my horn again , i cut your hand off !
okay , big shot .
do it . do it , if it &apos;ll get us there faster .
look , i know i said i &apos;d spring for a cab , but it &apos;s $ 70 !
and i &apos;m gonna need that for a junior king room
at the holiday inn express !
don &apos;t worry , han , we &apos;ll chip in .
no , we won &apos;t . we need that $ 356 .
that &apos;s all we made today .
it has to last till we &apos;re 82 .
this is our funeral money , max .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll make more money .
not much more , but a little bit .
damn it !
i can hear the bagpipers coming this way .
they &apos;re playing closing time .
that means the parade &apos;s over .
now i &apos;m never gonna sell the pee funnels .
all right , i gotta move some t @-@ shirts .
heads up , peoples !
&quot; kiss me i &apos;m irish &quot; crotch tees . $ 15 .
or two for 25 ! five for 60 !
you nobody !
you can &apos;t sell those out the window .
that &apos;s illegal . you need a permit !
just drive , grandma .
i can &apos;t believe you call yourself russian .
doesn &apos;t seem like you &apos;re rushin &apos; anywhere .
you say that again , and i &apos;ll cut your tongue out !
oh , now you &apos;re gonna cut out my tongue ?
why do you want to punish all the women in the tri @-@ state area ?
look , oh , my god , it &apos;s earl !
earl , what &apos;re you doing here ?
hey , y &apos;all !
this is my bagpipe group black irish .
肤色也较深的爱尔兰人
i &apos;m black , they &apos;re irish .
why didn &apos;t you tell us you were coming to the parade ?
well , i kinda like to keep my skirt wearing on the d.l.
when did you learn how to play bagpipes ?
i do not know .
i took too much acid once , and , when the trip ended ,
i could play the bagpipes and drive a stick .
i &apos;ll catch up with you at blarney &apos;s .
han , pay the man .
it &apos;s ten blocks away . we can walk .
in these shoes ?
in these shoes ?
ugh , green beer .
is this really how we honor the irish ,
some of our greatest writers and poets ?
oh , did they come up with ,
&quot; if you sprinkle when you tinkle ,
be a sweetie , wipe the seatie &quot; ?
first of all , not a real poem .
and as the person who shares your bathroom ,
maybe take that advice .
maybe take that frown and get it drunk .
okay , sure , we &apos;re two young girls on the town
on what &apos;s probably america &apos;s most dangerous holiday .
why--why have our wits about us ?
that &apos;s the spirit .
and who knows ? maybe you &apos;ll meet a cute , irish guy .
happy st. paddy &apos;s day !
blarney bill .
are you the owner of this colorful establishment ?
i &apos;m not even the owner of these pants .
where &apos;s me kiss ?
blarney bill is like the mascot of this place .
every year i kiss him for good luck .
and when does that luck kick in ?
where &apos;s me kiss ?
i left it in me other purse ?
wow . that &apos;s a wet moustache .
scotch and fish .
what ?
that &apos;s why it &apos;s wet !
man , he &apos;s the best .
the best what ?
hey , girls !
sold my last shirt .
hey , told you that small would fit .
look at han at that table with all those ...
i want to say &quot; girls ... &quot;
waiting to take pictures with him .
mm , becca !
be @-@ becca !
over here .
oh , no , you &apos;re not becca .
hey , though .
oh , my god , you look so much like my friend becca .
are you guys in line to take pictures with the leprechaun ?
no .
$ 5 .
wait , what ?
ah , yes , we are the leprechaun &apos;s mcagent and mcmanager .
it &apos;ll be $ 5 to take a selfie with the leprechaun .
that is a great deal .
max , i am not doing this .
fine .
then we &apos;ll have to use the cupcake money for our cab home .
okay , that there is virgin leprechaun .
so it &apos;s $ 10 .
10 for a picture , 15 for a kiss , nothing below the waist .
that &apos;s &apos; cause there &apos;s nothing below the waist .
will you take a 20 ?
i mean , i guess .
just so you know , if you &apos;re an orphan , i &apos;m interested .
are you over here making money off of me ,
you wolves of wall street ?
we &apos;re just taking advantage of drunk people .
it &apos;s a st. paddy &apos;s tradition ,
like corned beef or punching a cop .
well , then maybe you can get them to take advantage of me .
get a little handsy on hansy .
i &apos;ve got my eye on that buxom paralegal .
the one over there who brought in outside chicken ?
hook daddy up !
so i &apos;m going up to the woman
who brought her own two @-@ liter of coke to a bar
to ask her for money to touch you .
that &apos;s the gist .
what &apos;s happened to my life ? where am i ?
blarney &apos;s !
oh , god , it &apos;s blarney bill .
hey , that &apos;s my name !
where &apos;s me kiss ?
oh , well , i--
i have to go to the ladies &apos; room
and wash whatever is on my mouth and in my mouth
off my mouth and out of my mouth .
we &apos;ve been in this line so long , now i actually have to pee .
max , are you eating chicken ?
she didn &apos;t have 10 bucks to tickle han ,
so she paid me in purse chicken .
i think i came out ahead .
uh , sorry , back of the line . no cuts .
please . i &apos;m feeling sick .
sorry , no cuts , no buts , no coconuts .
is that one of those famous irish poems too ?
i totally understand . yeah , i get it .
just let her cut . it &apos;s st. patrick &apos;s day .
she &apos;s having fun .
not to bring up my st. patrick &apos;s day tradition at the plaza ...
oh , good .
but it was so much better than this place .
i mean , there were no lines .
we &apos;d sit like non @-@ animals in the palm court and sip bellinis .
i &apos;m taking you to palm court
if you tell that story one more time .
guys .
i just threw up .
and you &apos;re carrying it around like a baby chick ?
i @-@ i think i &apos;m gonna need some water .
i have to drive a school bus in four hours .
you &apos;re a great american .
i know what i am .
where &apos;s me kiss ?
uh , she has it .
dodged a bullet .
bullet found ya .
come on . i have to find another bathroom .
i &apos;m not peeing anywhere near blarney bill .
i don &apos;t want him to find &quot; me kiss &quot;
when i have me pants down .
i gave him your number . is that cool ?
oh , no . i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna make it .
you mean in life ? yeah , me neither .
no , it &apos;s all that green beer .
and if i wet myself here on 53rd street , ,
i &apos;ll be forced to abandon you , move to the midwest ,
and start a new life .
i have a bathroom you can use .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s some chicken in it .
i &apos;ve hit some very low points today ,
but i &apos;m not about to pee through a paper penis in public .
here , quick , just pop a squat over here behind the float ,
i &apos;ll block you so no one &apos;ll see ,
and the 15 high school marching bands &apos;ll
mask the sound of you hitting rock bottom .
gimme that thing .
damn it , max . damn it !
how do i do this ?
well , i do have my master &apos;s in public urination from devry .
just unzip , put it in your pants ,
and let a river run through it .
no one &apos;s looking , right ?
nope .
hi , caroline .
sophie , you were in the parade ?
of course i was .
you can &apos;t be a volunteer firefighter
without being in the parade .
you &apos;re a volunteer firefighter ?
well , i do go down to the station voluntarily .
besides , every fire station needs a pole ,
and i &apos;m it , baby .
anyway , we &apos;re all going to blarney &apos;s .
shots on me .
and by that i mean shots on me .
come on .
when the firemen &apos;s pole offers you drinks , you say yes .
max , i am not going back in there .
in fact , i &apos;m treating you to a drink at the plaza .
you know that money we were saving for our funeral ?
that &apos;s no longer an issue because i just died right then .
rest in pee , caroline .
look , max , our bellinis .
thank you , claude .
he &apos;s a plaza institution .
and i just remembered his name is rolph .
you forgot the name rolph
after we just saw a girl do that in her hands ?
isn &apos;t it lovely here ?
less blarney &apos;s , more barney &apos;s .
and trust me , these bellinis are famous .
why ? did they make a sex tape ?
ooh , kind of tastes like the time
i put canned peaches in my boxed wine .
max , a plaza bellini is a far cry from boxed wine .
well , my rule is , if i have to refrigerate it , it &apos;s fancy .
i &apos;m talkin &apos; to you , batteries .
或者可以让电池较为耐久
you know , tonight is really bringing up
how much i miss the old me .
yeah , tonight is really bringing up
how much i miss my friend archie .
who ?
the guy you hit with the champagne balloons .
sells car seat covers in rhode island .
you know how i said he was doing really well ?
truth is i haven &apos;t talked to him in a year .
really dropped the ball .
and the most exciting thing about this place--
those elevator doors can open ,
and you never know who &apos;s gonna step off .
max , this is nice .
max , this is boring . what happened ?
nothing . absolutely nothing .
now i &apos;m thinking maybe this wasn &apos;t
as much fun as i thought it was .
now i &apos;m thinking archie &apos;s dead .
&apos;cause i feel like i got a text about it and ignored it .
even this bellini doesn &apos;t taste as good .
i knew it , my taste buds must have committed suicide
after my first 7 @-@ 11 sushi .
i mean , nothing is the same .
why did i think this was fun ?
because before you met me , you didn &apos;t know what fun was .
i get your point , max ,
but i did own a caribbean island with six jet skis .
oh , come on , get over it .
drink up . it &apos;s not that bad .
can you just let me feel sad ?
no !
not on st. patrick &apos;s day .
you have a good time ,
and you don &apos;t think about your problems .
that girl who threw up in her hands ,
she didn &apos;t sit around saying , &quot; eh , meh , my life sucks . &quot;
no , she threw her hands in the air ,
hit a lot of people with the vomit ,
and kept the party going .
yeah , the party was all over everybody &apos;s shoes .
look , it doesn &apos;t matter that this is literally
the stupidest place i &apos;ve ever been in my whole frickin &apos; life .
let &apos;s get another $ 40 roberto benigni
而roberto benigni罗伯托 · 贝尼尼是名导演
and keep our party going .
come on , let &apos;s go . there &apos;s no party here .
there may be a $ 3 million bat mitzvah happening upstairs ,
but there &apos;s no party here .
but i do know where there is one .
we &apos;ll just take the check , rolph .
and i just remembered his name is dennis .
max , i &apos;m sorry if i rained on your parade today .
well , peed on it .
don &apos;t worry about it .
everything that means something to me gets peed on .
hey , girls ! i heard you left !
you missed me winning the hula @-@ hooping contest .
when did you learn how to hula @-@ hoop ?
once again , i do not know .
you &apos;re still rocking the bagpipe ensemble .
i thought you wanted to keep
your skirt wearing on the low @-@ low .
that was before i discovered the sensation
of a cool breeze circling my bag and my pipe .
hey ! max , caroline !
excuse me , move it . move it . move it .
hey , move it . wanna break my big @-@ ass clover ?
girls , where did you go ?
we went to the plaza , and i realized my life
may actually be richer now than when i was rich .
oh , no . is it too late to walk away ?
can you girls loan me some cash ?
i met a girl , and i need money for the bus
back from her sister &apos;s condo in jersey city .
she said we &apos;ve got to be quiet , but i make no promises .
sure . i gotcha , han . what do you need , a 20 ?
oh , what the hell ? take 50 . we can always make more .
or not .
look at you throwing the cash around .
you know , girl , there might be hope for you yet .
jeanine , i &apos;m good to go .
told you , girls . 100 % .
looks like they &apos;re both gonna get unlucky tonight .
hey , max , caroline , over here !
i save ya a couple of seats .
and a couple of firemen .
uh , there &apos;s no place to sit .
oh , you are so green .
&apos;sup ?
happy st . paddy &apos;s day ! where &apos;s me kiss ?
scotch and fish !
