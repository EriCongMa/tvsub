i climbed , i don &apos;t know , like , a billion stairs .
and it &apos;s not like i can take them two at a time .
i don &apos;t care . we &apos;re not paying you $ 300 for this .
it &apos;s not my fault if you &apos;re too uptight to appreciate ..
the male form in all its glory .
okay , i &apos;m uptight . that &apos;s why i don &apos;t wanna watch a middle @-@ aged guy ..
dance around in what i can only assume is a child &apos;s halloween costume .
i may have borrowed this from my nephew ..
but let me assure you , what &apos;s underneath is all man .
i &apos;m sorry , did you say &quot; all man &quot; or &quot; old man &quot; ?
you &apos;re mean .

and you &apos;re gonna be going there with joey tribbiani .
pass .
nope . you must be thinking of someone else .
i was never in a band .
you made out with missy goldberg ?
how could you do that after you promised me ?
excuse me .
that didn &apos;t make us sound gay at all .
you broke the pact .
ross , that was 16 years ago .
that doesn &apos;t matter . we &apos;re talking about the foundation of our friendship .
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair .
if we &apos;re really gonna do this , it &apos;s not like you never broke one of the pacts .
i didn &apos;t .
oh , really ?
no .
oh , really ?
no .
adrienne turner .
yes ?
hey , adrienne .
hey , adrienne . hey .
i never did anything with adrienne turner .
oh , please . and you knew how much i liked her .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
really ? remember that party freshman year ?
a week before christmas vacation ? i do .
you had some visitors .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re at a real college party .
i have to pee so bad .
this is so awesome .
college guys are so cute .
hey , you &apos;ve got a boyfriend .
i know .
but if a guy who looks like corey haim wants to kiss me , i am so gonna let him .
hey , look , there &apos;s chandler .
that stupid friend of ross &apos; who said i was fat .
i &apos;ve already lost four pounds .
you can so totally tell .
i know !
well , let &apos;s see , maybe he knows where ross is .
hey , how &apos;s it going ?
aren &apos;t you .. ?
yeah , rachel .
and this is ross &apos; sister , monica . we met at thanksgiving .
right . so how you doing ?
bitchen .
hi , monica .
hi , chandler .
it &apos;s really nice to see you . not !
okay .
i &apos;ll see if i can find ross .
oh , my god , rach . beanbag chairs .
do not let me sit in one of those . we &apos;ll be here for days .
listen , adrienne , you can &apos;t tell chandler about this .
oh , believe me , ross , i won &apos;t be telling anybody about this .
cool .
no way .
i didn &apos;t know you knew about that .
well , i did . and it hurt .
that &apos;s when i wrote the song &quot; betrayal in the common room . &quot;
that &apos;s why that song had so much power .
man , i &apos;m sorry .
look , that was a long time ago .
so i made out with adrienne , and you made out with missy .
well , i guess we &apos;re even .
we are even , right ?
one more thing . i was so pissed at you that night , i wanted to get back at you .
so i thought , &quot; who does ross like more than anybody ? &quot;
what did you do to my mom ?
not her .
i am so drunk .
that &apos;s weird . i &apos;ve had the same number of beers as you and don &apos;t feel anything .
so you girls having fun ?
for your information , ass @-@ munch ..
i &apos;ve lost four pounds . maybe even five with all the dancing .
somebody order a pizza ?
oh , that &apos;s me !
i am so not gonna do good on my sats tomorrow .
well , maybe you could go to school here next year and we could totally hang out .
oh , yeah . there &apos;s a plan .
why don &apos;t i just start taking my smart pills now .
well , maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship .
what a line .
so where are you applying to ?
well ..
i think it &apos;s kind of really important that i go somewhere where there &apos;s sun .
so i &apos;m sort of .. hey !
i &apos;m in college , and i &apos;m in a band .
yeah , okay .
what &apos;s the matter ? you never saw a 50 @-@ year @-@ old stripper cry before ?
you know , it &apos;s fine . we &apos;ll pay you .
no , no , you &apos;re right . who am i kidding ?
i should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago .
half the time , it just pops off by itself .
maybe now is a good time for cake and presents .
what am i gonna do ? i mean ..
this has been my life for 32 years .
taking my clothes off in front of people is all i know .
no , there &apos;s got to be something else that you can do .
i mean , what skills do you have ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can make my pecs dance .
i can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks .
i can go to that special place inside me where i feel no shame .
so maybe something in an office .
or you could .. you could teach stripping .
you know , share your gift . pass the torch .
you know , actually , that &apos;s not a bad idea .
i could do it out of my apartment . i don &apos;t think my mom would mind .
there you go . okay . you think you &apos;re gonna be okay ?
yeah . yeah .
yeah .
this is so weird .
you never know when it &apos;s gonna be your last dance .
and i didn &apos;t even get a chance to finish it .
finish it .
what ?
your last dance . do it for us .
really ?
really ?
yeah . yeah , he deserves to do the thing he loves one last time .
okay . all right . get ready , ladies .
okay .
oh , this is so hot !
oh , no , don &apos;t stop .

i am so sorry that you have to do this with me .

plus , i should tell you , it did not last long .
hey !
i &apos;m in college , and i &apos;m in a band .
yeah , okay .
and now i &apos;ve killed one .
hey . where &apos;s rachel ?
she and phoebe took the stripper to the hospital .
sounds like your elegant tea party went off just as planned .
did you know chandler kissed rachel ?
what ? when was this ?
last week . we had some wine and ..
you don &apos;t know i &apos;m kidding .
1987 .
the weekend you guys visited me at school .
oh , my god . that &apos;s wild .
but it was , like , a million years ago .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
it matters to me .
why ?
because the night you kissed rachel ..
was the night i kissed rachel for the very first time .
you kissed her that night too ?
two guys in one night ?
oh , i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed .
seriously , where did this happen ?
okay ..
after you told me she was passed out in our room ..
i went in there to make sure she was all right .
she was lying on my bed , all buried in people &apos;s coats .
i went to kiss her on the forehead ..
but it was so dark , i accidentally got her lips .
i started to pull away , but then i felt her start to kiss me back .
it was only for a second , but it was amazing .
and now i find out that you kissed her first .
wait , what bed did you say she was on ?
mine .
i &apos;m sure i put her on my bed .
no , she was definitely on my bed .
why would i kiss a girl and then put her on your bed ?
well , then who was on my bed ?
no ! no !
yes !
you were under the pile of coats ?
i was the pile of coats !
oh , my god !
you were my midnight mystery kisser ? !
you were my first kiss with rachel ? !
you were my first kiss ever ? !
what did i marry into ? !
