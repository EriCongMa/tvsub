Why are you following me?
Should I take these off?
Spencer, hi. I'm Yvonne.
Hi.
Toby's told me so much about you.
I erased the security footage from the hotel
the night Charlotte was murdered.
The security company we use backs up all of our tapes.
If the police get a hold of that drive
they'll see that Aria left the hotel and they'll know
that you're the one who erased the footage.
You're protecting a friend.
One of the many things I love about you.
Wow, that was fast.
If you're really not okay with this--
No, that was just a knee-jerk reaction. It's fine.
Are you sick?
No, I'm donating my eggs.
Do we really think that's a murder weapon?
I think my dad might have had something
to do with Charlotte's murder.
He swore that if Charlotte ever got out
he would do whatever it takes to protect me.
Did I scare you?
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I, uh, I have something to tell you.
I guess you have been able to put things together.
Enough to know that I have been hiding something from you.
I have to confess that I've..
I've been seeing someone.
Wh.. Wait, what?
Mom, hey, how long have you known about this?
Umm, well...since he asked me.
Congratulations.
I'm so glad we finally told you.
Now we don't have to sneak around anymore.
That's why I saw you at the Radley.
Oh! You saw me?
I-I did. Yeah.
I guess I just thought it was for some other reason.
With you being back in town
we needed to find some place to talk.
About when to tell you and Mike.
Should we call him again?
No, let's just give him a chance to call us back first.
Seems like he's never in his dorm room anymore.
You are okay with this, right?
Yeah.
You're making a lot of noise
and none of it sounds like an omelet.
The car will be here in five. We overslept.
Well, maybe we should have went to bed earlier.
What fun is a sleepover if we actually sleep?
We can stop somewhere on the way for coffee.
时间很紧张...
Umm, I might need to go up a little later.
I have to make some calls.
Isn't Claudia's charity trunk show tonight?
I thought you said you're going back for that.
That's why I brought a car back down here
so we could spend more time together
and then drive back into the city.
I know I sound like a whinging sook, but..
I miss you.
I just have to be near a landline.
You know the cell service on the turnpike.
I have a ton of stuff to confirm.
Her hair, her makeup, her nail tech
her masseuse, her trainer, her astrologer, I mean..
What am I forgetting? Oh, her therapist.
Is it really worth all this grunt work?
Johnny Wujek wasn't always styling Katy Perry.
Everybody starts in the trenches.
And my trench is Claudia.
I'll work one year with her
five years as creative director
and then hello, Katy.
But I'm gonna do that in three.
I'm sorry. I keep changing things last minute.
I'll just see you tonight.
Your tie.
I don't even care.
Sorry. I'm a little bit early.
It's just my mom is driving me nuts.
Uh, girl stuff. Your car's probably here.
I'll leave you to your secrets then.
Bye.
Be careful. I could get used to this.
Honestly, ahem, I just wanted to, uh
make sure you were fully awake.
For what?
I think that we need to go to the cops with these new texts.
I'm awake.
I mean if we really are back at square one with A--
We don't know for sure that this is an A.
I don't know. That trash can full of black hoodies?
It felt like somebody was saying all the rules are changed.
And all we know for sure is this A isn't Charlotte.
They could be anybody, anywhere
hiding in plain sight.
As in Sara Harvey?
I mean, do you really think that it's her
hiding behind all those evil emojis?
I don't know. She can't really type that well.
Maybe a picture's easier for her to send.
I'm starving. Do we have anything?
Yeah, I got a little something.
You want a refill?
Yes, please.
Hey, what about Ezra?
Couldn't he clear this up?
Has anybody heard from him?
Well, my guess is that he left town
to avoid telling us what he knows.
I mean, I'm not even saying we need to build an airtight case.
We could just go to Toby.
No.
Caleb, he's finally happy.
He's moved on. I really don't wanna throw this in his path.
At least not until we have something more
than a few snarky emojis from an unlisted number
and a photo of an alleged murder weapon.
I guess you're right.
I mean, we're talking about Aria's dad.
You know it's like if he did this, he did it to protect her.
If we were to get this golf club
Sara couldn't hold it over our heads.
And then we really could go to the cops about her.
It's, it's a calendar alert.
Have lunch with Gil.
I really don't remember scheduling that.
Oh, my God. This election is totally eating up my brain.
Oh, my God, I have endless e-mails
and then I've that strategy session this afternoon
and I have to make those campaign calls.
Yeah, I've been pretty distracted
the last few days too.
I might be slightly distracted.
Is this distracting you?
Mmm, no.
You know, I can probably just get a few e-mails done
if you wanna continue.
Yeah.
How about this?
That's slightly more distracting.
So what'd you tell Pam?
Uh, you know you can never call my mom that to her face, right?
I told her we were still narrowing down bridesmaids' dresses,
even though you haven't asked us yet.
I mean, you're gonna ask us, right?
You've a lot more to worry about than that.
You need me to drive you?
No, it's okay. The clinic has a service.
They just wanna make sure there's someone to help me
get me settled in the bed after.
I mean, I should be fine in a day or so.
Well, I'll mash up your Jell-O just the way you like it.
Em, you seem nervous.
Hey, these are your eggs. You can change you mind.
That's not it. I'm just...
I'm weirded out by that text.
From Aria?
Okay, this may sound crazy cynical
but if Byron and Ella do get remarried
doesn't that mean she wouldn't have to testify against him?
I mean, I'm not saying that Byron's guilty.
Did I miss the memo that says we call people's parents
by their first names now?
It's just like "Downton Abbey" where Bates goes on trial--
Hanna, I'm talking about the text from Ali.
Didn't you..
No.
Oh, she's back.
And of course, she reaches out to me alone
and just assumes I'll come and hear her out.
I'm not doing it. I mean I can't.
Keeping this secret from my mom has been hard enough.
And yesterday I took this gigantor shot
and I feel like I've had three too many Macchiatos.
I mean, why does she do this, why does she always come
to me first and just expect that--
Okay, are you gonna breathe
or just keep talking until you pass out?
Sorry, it's the hormones.
Just tell her you're busy.
Oh, I don't know why I didn't think of that.
Hormones.
Okay, well, can you keep them in check for ten minutes?
This is work.
Morning, Claudia.
I'm out of gum.
Charity is so stressful.
You know I like to chew when I'm stressed.
Yeah, I put a whole case in your desk.
Uh, peppermint, not wintergreen.
Wet nails. I'll smudge.
Ask your manicurist to look in the bottom left drawer.
Do you need anything else?
Yes.
Umm, call Wilhelmina 'cause I wanna switch out
all the models for tonight.
Tell them I want Asians.
Only Asians. Very into Asians.
They're incredibly chic.
This is Ezra. Leave me a message.
Voice mailbox full.
Did I interrupt?
Oh, it's, it's nothing.
What's up?
We sprang some pretty big news on you last night
and I got the sense that maybe you're not as happy as we are.
I-I just did not see it coming... at all.
I know your surprised face.
It's very different than your concerned face.
If you have concerns, I wish you'd share them.
I guess it was just all the... sneaking around.
I-I just had it in my head that something else was going on.
Like what?
Well, I've been thinking all sorts of things
since Charlotte was killed.
I guess we haven't really talked about that a lot.
Did your father and I give you too much space?
Maybe. I didn't even see you guys at the hearing.
To be honest, neither one of us would have stood
in support of her release.
We didn't want our opinion to influence your statement.
You needed to tell the truth.
What about later that night?
We assumed you wanted to process things with your friends.
So..
What?
We took advantage of the fact that you were with your friends
and your father was at my apartment.
Wait, you two were..
you were together the whole night?
I'm... not the kind of mom
who wants to share those details.
I checked in with you the next day.
What are you asking me?
Forget it. I..
I-I'm just realizing that this is a good thing.
It's a really, really good thing.
Oh, hi.
I didn't know you were coming by.
If I ask you a question
are you gonna promise not to lie to me?
Hanna, I'm running late.
Why'd you do it, Mom?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
The exact drive with the exact footage of the hotel
the night Charlotte was murdered, it's now missing?
I don't buy it.
From what I understand
the police are still looking for that.
Are you really gonna make me accuse you?
I'd prefer you didn't
especially when I had nothing to do with it.
So the fact that it went missing the day I told you what I did
that's just a coincidence?
I suppose it is.
Hanna, the police haven't come knocking with a warrant.
The only person who suspects that backup drive
is in this house is you.
Mom, just tell me where it is. I'll get rid of it.
Hanna, the drive is gone.
Gone? Did you--
Just be grateful your mistake has been erased.
Don't think about this, think about..
...wedding cakes and flowers and..
Fine.
I won't bring it up again.
Who knew your mother had that whole stash of sample products?
It's like she's hoarding moisturizer.
Yet another thing she's good at hiding.
Okay, did I just let Sara Harvey trick me
into trashing every room in my mother's house?
What if your mom's telling the truth?
What if she actually destroyed the drive?
Sara wouldn't have asked for it
unless she really thought it was here.
And if I don't hand it over, she's gonna crash my wedding.
Wait.
We really think this is Sara Harvey sending these texts?
Who else would it be?
Well, if she leaves the hotel to pick up the drive
I can get in there and I can grab that golf club..
...before she tries to take a swing at one of us.
We don't have the drive.
But she thinks we have the drive.
So we give it to her.
Dr. Rollins?
Elliott, please.
I apologize for the intrusion, but I was hoping we could, uh..
She sent you, didn't she? Alison?
You didn't answer her messages.
It's kind of intentional.
Please.
She doesn't know I've come to you. I'm just trying to help.
I can't see her right now.
She wants to apologize. Her behavior was alienating.
She shouldn't be alone right now. Just come by.
For what? A pizza and a movie?
No, thank you.
I thought it wouldn't hurt to try.
This was a bad time to ask a favor of you.
If you need anything--
I need you to leave now.
Please.
Umm, are you sure, Gil?
It wasn't rescheduled for another day?
Oh, really, you don't have it in your calendar at all.
Okay, umm..
That-that's fine. Umm, I'll--
Spencer.
Okay, I'll-I'll call you right back.
Hey, Yvonne.
I'm so sorry.
Uh, whoever updated my calendar didn't, uh,
include your contact info, so I wasn't--
Couldn't call me to tell me that you're late for our lunch?
Exactly. Though I guess I could have called the restaurant.
Yeah, umm, so, so somebody else updates your calendar for you?
Uh, yeah. There's a campaign aide in charge of coordinating.
That's probably who you talked to, to schedule.
Yeah. Umm, yes, I did. Yeah.
You know I have to admit I didn't expect you to reach out.
Uh, the town hall was such a success
but I guess I just assumed we'd retreat to our own corners.
Umm, well, you know, I really wanted to pick
your brain if that's okay.
Uh, this whole daughter-of-the-candidate thing
it's so new to me and so--
Of course.
You know..
Umm, inside or out?
Uh, inside's great.
Do you mind if I just make one quick call?
And then I'll be right in.
Of course, I'll get a table.
Okay, thanks.
Uh, Caleb, Yvonne just showed up to my lunch with Gil.
Uh, did he arrange it? Some sort of campaign thing?
No, he's not here and she thinks that I invited her.
Ten bucks says Evil Emoji is trying to stir the pot.
And she probably hacked both of your phones.
Can you get out of there?
No.
You know what, I think I'm gonna stay.
Maybe she can help me figure out who scheduled this.
I shall see you soon. Bye.
I wouldn't have made the effort
if I'd known how much it would upset Emily.
I tried to reach the others, but..
Good morning, Haley. That was a great essay.
Thank you.
Let it go.
I mean, I've done enough to force them away.
I don't wanna force them to take my apology too.
You may have made it difficult for your friends to support you
but that doesn't change the fact that you still need them.
How long has it been since your father made an effort?
Or Jason?
You're right.
My friends are the closest thing I have to family now.
You've been my rock.
I have more vacation days.
I can take them if you need me to.
I appreciate that, but..
...I'm home.
Time to get back to work.
Back to normal.
Or at least try.
I have work to catch up on and they want me to start
taking over my classes tomorrow, so..
Then I'll see you later?
Yeah.
Thank you for trying.
And we both know politics is not an honest game.
You have to get used to the idea that there is no
expectation of privacy.
You're always being watched.
So how did you learn to trust the people
who work for your campaign?
My mom ran for the school board when I was eight.
I've grown up with the idea that you can't trust
everyone with everything.
I'm guessing trust is hard for you
given what you and your friends went through.
Yeah, I mean, y-yeah, people know what we went through.
That's inevitable.
I wasn't out in the world for very long
before I realized that my entire sense of people was..
...warped and I had to pound myself into a normal shape.
Cut clear a...
Had to cut off bad habits with a blowtorch.
And I had to weld on new ones wherever they would fit.
There's nothing wrong with being an Iron Lady, Spencer.
In fact, they're my favorite kind.
Thank you.
Umm, you know what--
Uh-uh, I insist. Really.
Uh, next one is on me then.
I will hold you to it.
I gotta run.
Okay.
Thank you again. Bye.
Thank you.
Sara.
Can I help you?
I didn't realize you worked here.
I'm looking for Room 19.
In the East Wing.
Across the courtyard on the left.
I knew you worked here.
I don't know why I lied.
My physical therapist connected me to a teacher.
I'm supposed to give a talk on...living with a disability.
But..
But what?
Why are you here?
After the accident...
...when my hands were still numb and bandaged
I spent months having to be fed.
I hated...every spoonful
from...every nurse's aide.
I'm not sure why I need to know this.
Because I mistreated every person who tried to help me.
But they kept on helping.
And now I have to do that for someone else.
I guess I, I just wanna say I'm sorry, Alison...
...for your loss..
...and for lying to the judge about charlotte.
You burned her at the stake on that witness stand
And you walked.
I was scared.
And I said whatever it took to protect myself.
I shouldn't have...
but I did.
I feel terrible about it
and everything that's happened to her since.
We both know what it meant to be close with Charlotte.
I felt like we were sisters.
She used you to replace me.
When no one else was there for her, I was.
That wasn't my choice.
I didn't reject her.
I didn't lock her up.
And I spent the past five years making up for lost time
getting to know her.
We never really knew all of her.
But I was hoping...
maybe you and I can put our pieces together
and...understand things a little better?
I want something good to come from all of this.
We're all she had.
I promise this will pass for the real drive.
I'm glad you came to me.
You know you can always come to me.
Yeah, I know.
Spencer, sorry, uh, I-I was just leaving.
No, there's no need to rush off. I'm...
Actually, I'm really glad that both of you guys
are here right now.
What's up?
I did something not entirely out of character.
But just out of practice.
What's going on, Spencer?
Toby's fiancee kind of left this.
And I kinda sort of didn't give it back right away.
Y-you know this is a good thing.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I can use it to try to find out who's sending these texts.
Or at least get a little bit closer.
I was hoping you'd say that.
I don't know who's more needy today.
Sara Harvey and this freaking hard drive
or my boss and her gum.
I have to take this.
I'll look at both phones.
Maybe with two hacks, I can follow the trails
back to a common source.
How long do you think it will take?
Uh, I'll clone yvonne's cell phone.
I mean, she'll have it back before she knows it's gone.
No, Claudia, I can't leave.
Yes, I'll handle it over the phone.
Yeah, I promise. I can get you another four feet of catwalk.
You guys, I've gotta go.
Later.
Bye, Hanna.
Ali.
I know you don't wanna see me.
I was just gonna leave.
Well, is something wrong?
Come in.
I...
Something happened. It's really strange.
Sara Harvey, she came to see me.
I think Sara and Charlotte might have been closer
than we thought.
I think Sara actually cared about her.
Why would you believe a word she says?
Can I just stay here for a bit?
I could really use someone to talk to.
I can't stay. I actually have somewhere to be.
Great!
Elliott told you?
Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision,
so I need to do it.
You can say whatever you wanna say.
I don't care. Just...
promise me you won't tell my mom.
Emily, Elliott didn't.
Honestly, I had no idea.
You're donating your eggs?
Oh, my god!
I'm such a jerk.
When is this happening?
Umm, today.
And you're going by yourself?
No, Han, I-I booked online.
I didn't wanna run into your mom and have her ask questions.
Umm, hang on a second.
Hanna, I think she's inside. I gotta go.
Excuse me.
Hi, can I get you a table?
Uh, no. I found this outside.
Uh, I was wondering if you had a lost-and-found?
Thank goodness. I've been looking for that everywhere.
I'll just tell Yvonne the restaurant found this.
I'll keep you out of it.
Why?
I wouldn't want people to think you stole somebody's phone.
Somebody whose mother is running against your mother.
That would be awkward.
Did you set this all up?
Set all what up?
Me and Yvonne, this lunch.
Maybe even her leaving her phone.
Were we supposed to start fighting over Toby, hmm?
Candidates' daughters in boyfriend brawl.
That isn't exactly explosive, political cannon fodder.
And this isn't exactly the race for a senior class president.
We don't do those kinds of things anymore.
Do we, Spencer?
棕色垃圾箱
Hey, Claudia.
Yeah, I know.
I know. I understand.
I'll be there.
6:30 at the latest. I'm leaving now.
All done?
You might start to get sleepy from the sedative.
Thanks.
Ali, you don't have to wait here with me.
There is no way I'm gonna leave you here alone.
I'll be right here when you wake up.
Can I ask you something?
What are you gonna do after this?
I'm gonna use the money to finish school.
Ezra needed some place quiet to work,
so I booked a room.
I-I just assumed I could expense it.
Are you sure that I can't?
Ms. Harvey--
I asked for privacy...
Umm, just take it out of my paycheck, I guess.
Just leave them outside the door.
The rooms need to be cleaned, once a week in minimum.
That's a policy--
Didn't I clear your policy?
Yeah, I'll, I'll run it by accounting next time.
Thank you.
I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
How about brunch for two, our expense?
I don't eat brunch.
Alright. If you'll excuse me.
What are you doing?
Lie still, Emily.
What is that?
This isn't going to hurt a bit.
Don't worry, it'll all be over soon.
Take it out. Take it out.
What did you do to me?
Get off me!
No, no!
No! No!
No.
Take it out!
Take it out!
What did you do to me?
Emily. Emily, stop, breathe.
Where were you?
I was right outside.
Did you pass anyone?
D-did you see a nurse with a m-mask on her face?
What? No.
No, she was in here hiding in the dark.
I, I'm...groggy, but I know I saw her.
Who?
Sara Harvey.
Emily, calm down.
It was just the drugs in your system.
No, sh-she was in here.
I was in here the minute they brought you out of surgery.
I just went to go find the nurse because...you were agitated.
I saw, I saw her.
I know I saw her.
Em, relax.
You still have anesthesia in your system.
It wasn't real, okay?
Now get some rest, so I can take you home.
Please tell me you don't own a selfie stick.
Company Christmas party.
Don't judge me. These things come in handy.
Let's see what we've got.
Well, looks like nobody's in there.
Aria, I haven't broken into a place since my dorm room.
And those keys cost like a $100 to replace.
And I don't really know what you think I'm capable of.
Hotel door locks are electronic.
Yeah, but I'm thinking we get in there another way.
You pick the lock on the balcony.
What?
Oh, my God! You're not serious.
You, you're tall. You've got long legs.
Okay, would you like me to toss you over first like a frisbee?
What else are we supposed to do?
Come on! Team Sparia.
Old time's sake?
I've got to get in there and I've got to get that golf club
before Sara tries to frame my Dad.'
Alright.
Okay, watch out.
Okay.
Yeah, on second thought, can you come back over here
And toss me like a frisbee?
Come on.
You can do it, little big one.
Okay, just give me a second.
I should have thought ahead and worn flats.
That's it.
Alright.
She was trying to take out her iv.
Some patients have a rough time coming out of anesthesia.
Honestly, I feel a lot better.
Good, because I need to have a conversation
about something that happened during the procedure.
Can...we have a moment?
Umm, you know, she can stay.
Alright.
Well, there's been an unforeseen development.
This has to do with the couple
who had planned on using your eggs.
They decided to back out.
It's good news. They're pregnant.
They found out earlier today.
But it means they won't need your eggs
which we've already retrieved.
You have a decision to make.
Can she keep them?
They can be frozen for later use
But there are costs associated with that choice.
They can also be destroyed.
No.
If it's possible, can I donate them somewhere?
I mean, I, I still feel like I wanna help someone
start a family if I can.
Well, we work with a few egg banks across the state
that accept donations.
I'll get the paperwork started.
Crimson.
Scarlet.
Oh, Vermillion!
How am I the only designer in Manhattan
with an assistant that can't grasp the concept of red?
Okay, I'm late, but I'm here. Let me help you sort things out.
Oh, pardon. Do you have appointment?
I work here!
Hey, who the hell are you?
This my new assistant.
I don't know her name yet.
I am Greta.
6:30, Hanna. You promised.
I know, but I, I couldn't get a cab at Penn Station.
You, give me a hand.
Umm, your tacky, little panda bear mug
it's in that box with the rest of your things.
You can just take that and go.
Hand. Hand.
Give me..
Give me your hand!
Steam this for me, will you, honey?
Hey, you can't talk to people like that, Claudia.
Hanna, dear.
You're really stressing me out.
Why don't we end things on a high note, okay?
Um, on your way out, you can get me some gum.
Get your own damn gum, Claudia.
There's a pack in your desk.
Excuse me?
Two in your briefcase, two in your purse
and a whole stash in your bedside table.
I do everything you ask me to do and then some.
And all you do, you just pick me apart
and you send me on a thousand different, ridiculous errands!
Weren't you the girl that came marching in here
with a five-year plan?
Well, if you leave now
you're gonna be starting over again at the bottom.
Apologize
and maybe I'll consider keeping you on..
...as second assistant.
Is that the best you've got?
If you're trying to scare me into staying..
...you're gonna have to do way better.
There's a line of girls just waiting to take your place.
Fine, let them.
I've been pushed around by a lot worse than you.
If she's refusing maid service, shouldn't this..
...Place have been a little bit messier?
It doesn't even look like she's slept here.
Yeah, that or she's learned how to make
hospital corners with her teeth.
Spence.
You know what, umm, this was a really bad idea.
I think that we should just go back out the way that we came.
Yeah, you're right. Let's go.
There's no one here.
Okay, that's creepy.
Well, put it back or she's gonna know we were here.
She'll just blame it on housekeeping.
Do you wanna get someone fired?
Come on, let's find that golf club.
Do you feel anything?
No.
Where else could she be hiding a golf club?
I'm gonna go look in the closet.
Okay, I'll finish up in here.
Wow! I could live in here.
This thing is seriously bigger than my apartment.
You stood up for yourself.
She's gonna blackball me.
I should have apologized.
I should have begged for my job back.
I left my panda bear mug.
That magazine has relationships with dozens of designers.
I bet if I make a few calls
you'll have ten interviews by Monday.
Well, you should call "The Times" first.
Our wedding announcement cannot say
Jordan Hobart, junior VP of ad sales
marries Hanna Marin, unemployed.
Alright. That's enough.
I'm not gonna let you spin out.
Cuddle up. Come on.
I really don't care what the announcement
in "The Times" says. Okay?
And what if it said
Hanna Marin, luckiest girl alive
marries her genuine prince charming?
What do you wanna do?
You wanna go right to our place?
Or maybe stop somewhere for a drink?
No.
Do you wanna..
...get out of the city for a few days?
Go back to Rosewood? You can clear your head?
I don't wanna go to Rosewood

Whatever you want, love.
Aria.

Aria!
Aria?

Hanna?

If you can change the rules, so can we.
Goodbye.
