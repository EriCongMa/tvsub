don &apos;t worry . i have a suspect . ha !
i can &apos;t stand to see anything suffer .
now i &apos;ve got everything i need to convict your boy ,
except for motive , means and opportunity .
you also have no evidence .
that &apos;s implied !
so , i &apos;m remanding him ...
is that a word-- &quot; remanding &quot; ?
yeah , uh , to your custody .
maybe a mother can find out what a police chief can &apos;t .
what ?
let &apos;s go .
monarch butterfly , earwig ,
roly @-@ poly , doodlebug ,
beer cap , ant , beer bottle , barney .
all right , i &apos;m on a list !
flanders got a new dog !
aw , what &apos;s her name ?
mahershalalhasbaz . we just call her baz .
now it &apos;s time for her christian doggy training .
this will be interesting .
sit . kneel .
pray . play dead .
now resurrect .
and sit in glory at the right hand of todd .
finally , a religion that makes sense .
all right , mr. smarty , what went on back there ?
mom , why is it the only time you call me smart
is when you &apos;re being sarcastic ?
really ? do i do that ?
because i really shouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;re the one in trouble here , bub !
why don &apos;t you think about what you just did ?
why don &apos;t you think about what you just did ?
hmm . i will live with that forever ,
but this is about you .
i swear to you on my mother &apos;s grave , i didn &apos;t do a thing !
sorry , sorry .
so , the flanderses got a new dog , and it knows my name !
good for you , little girl !
marge , bart ,
i &apos;ve noticed neither of you have said a word all meal .
are there feelings going unexpressed here ?
because if there are ...
i believe someone at this table isn &apos;t telling us the truth .
master bart simpson !
kids , could you excuse us for a moment ?
your mother and i need to have an adult conversation .
what &apos;d he do ? what &apos;d he do ?
your son stole a bulldozer .
how do you know ?
a mother knows .
does a wife know things ?
yes .
i believe we were talking about bart.
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know how to handle him anymore .
oh , bart &apos;s ten . he &apos;s too old to be handled .
we should just think of excuses for when he goes bonkers .
oh . &quot; acne medicine . &quot;
when in doubt , blame the acne medicine .
no , i &apos;m not giving up on bart ,
just like i didn &apos;t give up on our marriage
when you quit your job to start the north american sumo league .
the nasl would have made money
if someone had washed a few sumo loincloths for me !
i said i would do yours , but not the whole dojo .
bart , get in here !
look me in the eye and tell me
you know nothing about that bulldozer .
i know nothing about that bulldozer .
this is bad .
he can &apos;t tell his mother what he does .
where will that lead ?
any last words , boyo ?
i know nothing about that bulldozer .
give him the juice !
which one &apos;s yours ?
the one being electrocuted !
i &apos;ve never seen an eyeball pop so fast .
i wish i could tell you about that bulldozer ,
but how can i explain something i know nothing about ?
i am not cable news .
stop it ! stop it !
stop lying right now !
but @-@ but you have to believe me .
you &apos;re my mom !
all right , i will believe you on this .
smart .
but until then , i &apos;m going to keep my eye on you .
all the time .
all the time ?
how are you gonna change maggie ?
ah , close enough .
all aboard .
mom , what are you doing ?
i told you , to trust you , i have to watch you .
all the time .
you &apos;re gonna be riding this bus ?
i &apos;m going to be watching my son wherever he goes .
then you &apos;d better go out the back ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s where he went .
oh , you must be flanders &apos; new dog .
i just want to apologize in advance
for the things i &apos;m gonna blame on you .
homer , meet baz .
oh , sorry , flanders .
i &apos;m sure she has fun with you .
she sure likes you .
must be the cheeseburgers in your sweat .
cheeseburgers in my sweat . really ?
now , apparently , i have cheeseburgers in my sweat .
i can leave any time , bart.
just tell me what happened with that bulldozer .
next question .
fine .
which papers on the walls are yours ?
none of them .
is that the boy who copies off you ?
i copy off him ? !
what brand of poppycock
is this miscreant feeding you , madam ?
okay , mom , i admit it .
there &apos;s a few lies i told you that you &apos;re gonna find out .
simpson , you said your mother was dead .
she &apos;s become a zombie ! run !
mom , churros are good for you .
they &apos;re ethnic .
hey , simpson , you need your mommy
to cut your carrots for you ?
he can cut his own carrots .
baby carrots &apos; cause he &apos;s a baby !
brilliant !
mom , dad does plenty of stuff you don &apos;t like .
why don &apos;t you follow him ?
following an adult is creepy .
following your kid is parenting .
i &apos;m so lucky my mom &apos;s in gainesboro , florida ...
i think .
is my mom still outside ?
she &apos;s swinging on a swing , and ralph &apos;s pushing her .
hello ! good @-@ bye !
hello ! good @-@ bye !
hello ! good @-@ bye !
hello ! good @-@ bye !
hello ! good @-@ bye !
i am never leaving this tube .
sorry , lad . you &apos;ve been in more than five minutes ,
so i &apos;ve got to remove you .
and i &apos;m authorized to use the greatest weapon at me disposal .
no !
scotland ! 1,200 years ,
and we &apos;ve only written one song !
man .
staying on this all @-@ pork @-@ chop diet is easier than i thought .
that diet doesn &apos;t work .
you have to give it a year .
so , how was school today ?
well , actually ,
i caused quite a ruckus in the nurse &apos;s office
by pointing out they weren &apos;t putting fresh paper
on the lay @-@ down table .
very good , sweetie . could you lean back ?
i have to focus on your brother .
sure , sure . no need to worry about lisa .
lisa &apos;s always fine .
no worries there . nah .
aw . what are you doing here ?
i bet you escaped , and now flanders is worried sick .
i should call him ... after i scratch your tummy !
that &apos;s right !
who likes their tummy scratched while flanders is worried sick ?
you do ! you do ! yes , you do !
oh , he doesn &apos;t know where you are .
yes , he &apos;s probably crying right now .
come on , boy . we &apos;ll go to my room .
i can play jazz , or give you a bath , or ...
never chooses jazz .
middle child . no one cares about the middle child .
never , ever gonna change .
lisa , can i talk to you ?
oh , here it is , the quick check @-@ in
every two years just like clockwork .
all right , let me speak to you in a language you &apos;ll understand .
oh , boy , oh , boy , lisa never gets it .
she &apos;s great , and everyone knows that .
oh , man , trying to stay mad .
i &apos;m kind of impressed that dad &apos;s making an effort .
it &apos;s not really like him . i shouldn &apos;t say this .
i should never say this , but i will .
she &apos;s my favorite child .
oh , now he &apos;s pulling out the big guns .
oh , i don &apos;t want to pout anymore .
if he offers me ice cream , i &apos;m gonna break .
you want some ice cream ?
yes !
ice cream . oh , yeah , it &apos;s kid whiskey .
i knew he was gonna break .
i &apos;m gonna write a song .
is there such a thing as happy blues ?
that makes them happy
there is now ...
and the best part is i get some ice cream , too .
boys , isn &apos;t that the ball that she won &apos;t play with ?
she likes it when uncle homer throws it .
he &apos;s not your uncle !
so that means i can marry maggie ?
quit asking me that !
be ye friend or foe ?
well , be ye ?
this is the only place i can go
my mom doesn &apos;t know about .
bart , you know you &apos;re always welcome
to come stay in my tree house .
you don &apos;t have a tree house .
my dad &apos;s gonna build it .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t get a present from him
last birthday and christmas .
it &apos;s gonna be some tree house .
milhouse , you don &apos;t even have a tree .
he &apos;s gonna plant it soon .
he just has to get enough money together
to buy a pack of apple seeds .
just hand me the mountain doo .
your mom says that makes you bloated .
give me the damn doo !
finally safe from my mom .
she wouldn &apos;t want to come way out here
and ruin her dainty little shoes .
when she &apos;s got that much hair spray ,
nothing can stop her .
how &apos;d you find me ?
spool of thread in your pants .
i &apos;ll respool it for you .
i &apos;m good at doing things
so i can pretend there isn &apos;t a fight going on .
mom , you have gone too far .
superman &apos;s mom would never go in his fortress of solitude !
actually , the fortress of solitude has a statue
of superman &apos;s mother .
stop reading my comics !
i can &apos;t help it-- you leave them out everywhere .
when will you leave me alone ?
when you tell me about that bulldozer .
i know nothing about that bulldozer !
milhouse , is there something you know about the bulldozer ?
well , i know the bulldozer was invented in 1923
by james cummings and j. earl mcleod .
now , please , let me focus on the thread !
got to get out . get to get out .
dad , are you gonna snitch on me ?
moe &apos;s before bros !
crouching tiger , hidden mom .
&quot; property of ned flanders &quot; ?
that means you got this from homer .
lord , i truly love this dog ,
but maybe she &apos;d be happier next door .
but i don &apos;t want to give her up unless you think it &apos;s the best .
as always , i will interpret the lack of any sort of response
as a sign of thy will .
well , the kid passed through again .
we can all go inside .
nice rowing , bart.
good job .
stop caring about me !
sweetie , let me help you up .
your nagging is melting my bones .
okay , fine !
i &apos;m giving you one more chance , buster .
tell me about that bulldozer !
what bulldozer ?
you &apos;re in charge of yourself .
get home whenever .
my parenting stops now .
okay , now .
at last !
a way off lepers island !
boys ,
i realize now that baz would be happier in another home .
so we &apos;re giving her to ho ... ho ... ho ...
we &apos;re giving her to santa ?
no ! someone fatter .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , boys ,
that you had to hear that mild insult .
mild insults are like mild salsa--
they still burn !
bart , should i shut the door ?
no need . my mom &apos;s cool now .
check it out-- last night , i stayed up till 10 : 45 .
oh , my god !
i took a picture so i could show everybody .
now let me show you what i &apos;ve been planning .
welcome to our celebration of , er , uh ,
our city &apos;s lame @-@ o sign .
you nailed him !
&quot; fie &quot; ?
yeah . look it up .
&quot; used to express disgust or outrage &quot; ?
that &apos;s the worst f @-@ word there is !
bart , i &apos;m not butting in anymore ,
so you don &apos;t have to hide things under your blanky .
it isn &apos;t a blanky anymore .
hasn &apos;t been for three months !
so , we want you to have our dog .
you just give her love , and i &apos;ll pay for all the shots .
shots ? what , is she going to india ?
bye , baz .
aw , geez , i can &apos;t stand
to see flanders sad .
or happy .
pretty much can &apos;t stand to see flanders .
but he &apos;ll need something to cheer him up
when his boys run away .
you know what , flanders ?
i think you should take her back .
homer , don &apos;t be crazy .
look at that tail wag for you .
have you seen what it does for me ?
no , no , no . to her , i &apos;m just another dog .
a dog she &apos;s in love with but can never have .
but she &apos;s only got one of you , flanders--
the guy who will take care of her forever .
oh , thank you , homer .
this has been the happiest dog day afternoon ever .
i &apos;m still not sure-- did you do that bulldozer thing before ?
you were there . maybe when i hit you with the blade ,
you forgot some stuff .
i was trying to get your attention ,
but it was heavier than i thought .
well , no one fought more than cummings and mcleod
when they invented the bulldozer .
even the name &quot; bulldozer &quot; was a great source of ...
bart , i can &apos;t do this .
no offense , but i have a mother who still loves me .
we come here today to honor this sign ,
which was purchased , letter by letter ,
from other failed towns .
aw , stupid mom .
stuck something in my backpack .
typical .
oh , man , she makes good chicken .
you &apos;re the best boy a mom could want .
i &apos;ve failed as a mother !
i &apos;m growing a conscience !
i &apos;ve got to change this prank .
much better .
our iconic sign is aquiver !
everyone remain calm .
this is a part of the show .
vip &apos;s , follow me .
much better .
i don &apos;t seen nothing wrong .
better to die a vip
than to live as an ordinary american citizen .
it says &quot; f @-@ d. &quot;
it &apos;s a tribute to the fire department .
the chili @-@ cooking saints of the city !
it &apos;s true-- we do love our chili .
the secret is stirring it .
i &apos;m a huge fan . that &apos;s why i wear suspenders
and start little fires here and there .
mom , mom ...
i learned there &apos;s a line i won &apos;t cross ,
and it &apos;s &apos; cause of you and your chicken .
that woman does make convincing chicken .
you &apos;re the best boy a mother could want ...
if you tell me about the bulldozer .
all right . it was me .
why , you little ...
yeah , harder to strangle than it looks , isn &apos;t it , marge ?
and you &apos;re under arrest .
how &apos;d you figure it out ?
i heard you say it .
the only way i solve any crime .
you don &apos;t have to stop hugging .
so you see , mom ,
because of the wrinkled lay @-@ down paper
in the nurse &apos;s office , i got mono .
you really should &apos;ve kept your eyes on that ball .
oh , all these problems .
you kids are like whack @-@ a @-@ moles .
oh , that reminds me .
maggie hurt herself playing whack @-@ a @-@ mole .
come here , you .
come here . i know i &apos;ve been having my fun elsewhere ,
and no one could blame you if you didn &apos;t take me back ,
but if you &apos;ll have me ,
i &apos;ll take you on the longest walk of your life !
no hills .
dogs-- so easy to make up with .
