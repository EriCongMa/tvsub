it &apos;s not like i said , &quot; what would make this ride more fun ? &quot;
right . you &apos;re right , i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t be laughing .
i should be laying down papers for you .
how could you ?
i had to . we &apos;re getting married .
married couples can &apos;t keep secrets .
i guess monica should know about atlantic city .
dude !
what happened ?
chandler and i are in a bar ...
did you not hear me say , &quot; dude ! &quot; ?
... and this girl is making eyes at chandler .
so he goes over to her and after a minute or two i see them kissing .
now , you &apos;re thinking &quot; he &apos;s not the type to go to bars and make out with girls . &quot;
and you &apos;re right . he &apos;s not the type ...
... to go to bars and make out with girls .
you kissed a guy ?
oh , my god !
in my defense , it was dark and he was a very pretty guy .
oh , mon , i laughed so hard ...
so hard we had to throw out your underwear again ?
whatever , dude . you kissed a guy .
joey , do you think your favorite animal says a lot about you ?
no , because goats can &apos;t talk .
hi .
hey .
how &apos;s hilda working out ?
oh , my new assistant is working out . yes .
she happy she got the job ?
my new assistant was very happy that i hired my new assistant .
hello .

it &apos;s the producers at mac and cheese , if you &apos;ll excuse me for a minute .
hey , funny you should call . i was just looking over next week &apos;s script .

like they &apos;re taking it off the air ?
all right . i &apos;ll see you monday .
we &apos;re not even shooting them anymore ?
all right . bye .
they canceled mac and cheese !
sorry .
sorry , joey .
why would they do that ? it was a good show , right ?
you want to tell secrets ? okay . in college ...
... ross used to wear leg warmers .
all right , chandler entered a vanilla ice look @-@ alike contest and won .
ross came in fourth and cried !
i welled up .
oh , my god !
oh , is that funny ? you find that funny ?
maybe chandler should know your secrets too .
i already told him everything . you shush !
once she was sent to bed without dinner ...
... so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she &apos;d made .
ross stayed home every saturday night to watch golden girls .
monica couldn &apos;t tell time until she was 13 .
it &apos;s hard for some people !
of course it is .
wow .
chandler wore my underwear to work once !
hey !
i &apos;m sorry , i couldn &apos;t think of any more for ross .
in college , chandler got drunk ...
... and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm .
that was you .
whatever , dude . you kissed a guy .
i can &apos;t believe this !
mac and cheese was a great show .
how about that scene where mac teaches cheese how to yodel ? come on !
yeah , i actually liked that part .
how could this happen to me ?
yesterday i had two tv shows . today i got nothing .
wait a minute , what happened to days of our lives ?
well , they might be a little mad at me over there .
what happened ?
well , maybe i got a little upset , and maybe i told them where they could go .
joey , why would you do that ?
because ! they wanted me to audition .
you ? an actor ? that &apos;s madness !
rachel greers office .
tag .
hi , who was that ?
nobody . i was just practicing .
really ?
hi .
hi , rachel greers office .

phoebe .
that &apos;s a great name .
oh , you like that ?
you should hear my phone number .
okay . we &apos;ll be right back .
so you hired yourself a little treat , did you ?
i know how it looks , but i am telling you ...
you can &apos;t get involved with your assistant .
i know that , and i know hiring him was not the smartest thing i &apos;ve ever done .
but from now on , i swear this is strictly professional .
yes .
hey , rachel .
hi .
cute assistant . what &apos;s his story ?
is he ...
gay ? yeah .
hey , terry .
joey tribbiani .
surprised your big head could fit through our small halls .
i gotta go , joey .

give me another chance .
i can &apos;t .
wait , terry , please !
look , i just lost my other job , okay ?
you have no idea how much i need this .
please , help me out .
for old times &apos; sake .

it &apos;s not . dr. stryker ramoray is a miracle worker .
here he comes .
good morning .
drake , it &apos;s your brother , stryker . can you hear me ?
and cut .
i &apos;m back , baby !
you know , in my defense ...
... there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue .
and in my defense , the cleaning lady came on to me .
do you have trouble telling time now ?
no .
quick , what time is it ?
time to kiss a guy ?
what are you laughing at , pampers ?
you know when i said married people ...
... should share everything and not have any secrets ?
yeah .
yeah , that was stupid . let &apos;s not do that .
absolutely .
i &apos;m on board .
thank you . thank you .
we should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else .
yeah , definitely .
okay . if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
... l &apos;m gonna hang out with people who don &apos;t know the space mountain story .
then i &apos;d steer clear of phoebe .
man !
not that you would , but i wouldn &apos;t hang out with the guys at my office .
hi .
do you have a minute ?
sure . what &apos;s up ?
i got asked out twice today while i was at lunch ...
... by guys .
really ?
yeah .
did you tell someone that i was gay ?
oh , did you not want people to know that ?
i &apos;m not gay . i especially wouldn &apos;t want you to think i was gay .
why is that ?
i don &apos;t think i should say .
oh , you can say .
come on , i don &apos;t want you to feel like you can &apos;t tell me things .
okay .
okay .
well ...
yeah .
i &apos;d love to ask out your friend phoebe .
