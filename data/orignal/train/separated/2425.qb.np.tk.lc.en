i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
love brought me to mystic falls ,
love drove me away .
i love you , damon .
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
but as new enemies reveal themselves ...
jaryakat a zem .
things are spinning out of control .
i know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
silas is using his mind control to find katherine .
you all know elena gilbert .
well , the girl that i &apos;m looking for
looks exactly like her .
what do you want with katherine ?
i could tell you , but
wouldn &apos;t it be so much more fun if it were a surprise ?
why can &apos;t i get inside your head ?
with so many unanswered questions ...
somebody &apos;s already in there .
stefan &apos;s been suffering for months .
now the truth is about to be revealed .
you &apos;re right . he was hungry .
i bet he still is .
hey , man . last call was 4 hours ago .
if you want some coffee ,
i could put some on .
run . run !
you must have restless sleep syndrome or something .
it &apos;s like sleeping with a tornado .
we were up all night .
you &apos;re exhausted . come back to sleep .
i had a dream about stefan .
it was more than just a pit in my stomach this time , though .
it was real . it was like i was there with him .
i know i said it didn &apos;t bother me
that you have some psychic connection
to your ex @-@ boyfriend ,
but i don &apos;t need a play @-@ by @-@ play , elena .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s weird . sorry .
fine .
tell me . i &apos;m sure whatever &apos;s in my imagination
is 10 times worse than what &apos;s going on in your subconscious .
it was just so vivid .
i saw stefan walking out of this bar .
it had a red awning and this broken neon sign ,
and he was screaming in pain .
well , should i go check in the attic ,
see if there &apos;s a crystal ball ?
maybe you can conjure up an address .
route 29 . joe &apos;s bar .
i think i had the exact same dream .
so i &apos;ve found 9 bars along route 29,
and none of them are called joe &apos;s .
i had a feeling there was something wrong all summer ,
and i ignored it ,
but i was right . stefan was in a safe .
probably killed whoever it was that found him .
i know it sounds crazy
that i &apos;m following some psychic dream ,
but it &apos;s the only lead that we have .
it doesn &apos;t sound crazy .
it is crazy ,
but i &apos;m open @-@ minded .
shotgun !
what ? i get carsick in the back seat .
another charming human side effect you stuck me with .
please tell me that she &apos;s not coming .
trust me , i have no interest in katherine &apos;s well @-@ being ,
but for some reason , silas wants her real bad ,
and if silas wants her , i want her more .
can &apos;t we just stash her in the cellar
or maybe a deep , dark well with a pair of water wings ?
do you really think that i want to take a road trip with you ,
america &apos;s most boring , self @-@ righteous vampire ?
just remember , damon wouldn &apos;t have to play bodyguard
if you hadn &apos;t shoved that cure down my throat .
you were trying to kill me .
i will admit , though , i take great pleasure
knowing that you wasted your one shot
at a human life on me .
all right . play nice ,
or i &apos;m gonna revisit the deep , dark well idea .
i want to find stefan just as much as you do
and not just because i don &apos;t want to be a pawn
that you can trade off for his life .
i care about him .
i always have ,
and since we &apos;ve been having the same dream ,
makes me think that you care about him just as much .
ok . train &apos;s leaving the station . choo @-@ choo .
you ever play the &quot; what if &quot; game ?
when you &apos;re calcified for 2,000 years ,
you learn to entertain yourself with these little brain teasers .
look , silas . this phone is prepaid ,
and i don &apos;t have a lot of minutes .
oh , no , no , no . it &apos;s really easy . i &apos;ll go first .
you know how much i hate travelers ,
so to prove your allegiance to me ,
you killed your traveler friend gregor ,
but what if it as all an act ?
what if he &apos;s still alive ?
you saw him bleed out .
you buried his body yourself .
but what if matt &apos;s tacky ring brought him back to life ?
if this is the game , it &apos;s boring .
if we &apos;re gonna work together ,
i need to know that you &apos;re on my side ,
so find out if matt donovan &apos;s still alive
and kill him .
fine . say matt is still alive ,
what if he could help us to find katherine pierce ?
she &apos;s still your priority , is she not ?
yes , she is .
so get the information that you need ,
rip that ring off matt &apos;s little finger ,
and make sure he doesn &apos;t cheat death again .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i don &apos;t want to hurt you , so get away from me ,
before i rip your throat out .
hello to you , too .
i brought dinner .
a vampire doppelganger who &apos;s burdened by a conscience .
now i &apos;ve seen everything .
you saved me from burning to death
outside that bar this morning , didn &apos;t you ?
and i pulled you from the quarry before that .
that is , i figured out where you were
and told the former owner of this cabin
to pull your lock box from the water .
you thanked him by biting off his head .
how do you know i &apos;m a doppelganger .
because i &apos;ve seen your face before
on someone who wasn &apos;t you .
who are you ?
how much do you know about silas ?
i know that he &apos;s a bloodthirsty immortal
who &apos;s killed more people than i can count ,
and that was before he stole my identity ,
locked me up in a safe , and dropped me in the bottom of a quarry .
you made it through .
barely . i came very close to flipping off my humanity switch ,
but i didn &apos;t
because i knew if i ever got out
i wanted to be myself when i killed him .
strong words .
he &apos;s a monster ,
and i &apos;m going after him .
except you &apos;ll burn to death in the sun without your daylight ring .
silas wasn &apos;t always a monster .
he used to be a simple man
in love with a simple girl ,
his soul mate .
she was his one true love .
you know how that goes .
they thought their love would last forever .
how do you know all this ?
because i was there in his arms .
you &apos;re telling me that you were silas &apos; one true love .
i would have done anything for him .
that &apos;s impossible . how are you here right now ?
love bends the rules of possible .
silas and i were the two most powerful members
of a gifted people called travelers .
when we were engaged to be married ,
we decided to reach even further .
i don &apos;t ever want to be parted from you ,
even by death .
we wanted to find a way for our love to last forever .
yeah , look . i know the story .
everything was great for silas
until some witch named qetsiyah or whatever
came by and screwed him over , right ?
wrong . you don &apos;t know the story .
silas convinced qetsiyah that he loved her
so she would make the immortality spell ,
but when she found out that he was just using her ,
she dumped in a tomb with a cure ,
hoping he would take it and die
because she had created
a supernatural limbo to trap his soul .
like any other sane , rational , well @-@ adjusted woman would do .
which catches us up to today .
now silas wants to destroy that supernatural limbo .
once the other side is gone ,
he can take the cure ,
become mortal , and die ,
and finally pass on and find peace .
look . if you really are silas &apos; one true love
and you &apos;re not dead , then why don &apos;t you just do us all a favor
and run off into the sunset together ?
silas was my true love .
i never said that i was his .
i &apos;m qetsiyah ,
that sane , rational ,
well @-@ adjusted woman
you seem to know so much about .
clearly you &apos;ve heard the man &apos;s version of the story ,
the one where i &apos;m a back @-@ stabbing lunatic
who ruined everything for silas .
a raging bitch witch whose obsession with vengeance
created a whole new dimension of suffering in the afterlife .
what are you doing here ?
i thought you were dead and on the other side .
i was , for 2,000 years ,
but i came back ...
for you .
you sure you know what you &apos;re looking for ?
last bar had a red awning and a neon sign .
i &apos;ll know when i see it .
me , too .
didn &apos;t ask you .
i &apos;m just trying to make conversation .
anything to drown out the sound of eggshells breaking .
so , elena , i couldn &apos;t help but overhear
you &apos;ve been dreaming about stefan all summer ?
that must be really stressful on a new relationship ,
especially when you &apos;re having those kinds of dreams
lying in bed next to his brother .
they weren &apos;t dreams .
it was just a bad feeling ,
like something wasn &apos;t right with him .
oh , no . yeah , sure .
i totally get it .
there &apos;s still a connection between you two .
maybe deep down you know that he was your one true love
and breaking up with him was a big mistake .
ignore her . as soon as the vervain &apos;s out of her system ,
we &apos;ll compel her ,
and we &apos;ll put her on mute .
or maybe stefan &apos;s been trying to reach out to you all summer .
but you &apos;ve been too distracted with damon to help him
so he reached out to the person that he trusts--me .
nah . you &apos;re probably right .
elena and i had the exact same dream on the exact same night .
why would that mean something ?
what the hell did you do to me ?
look . i know you and your creepshow boyfriend
screwed with my head the other night .
so who the hell are you ,
and what do you want ?
i &apos;m here to keep you safe from silas .
silas ?
what do you know about silas ?
i know that he still wants you dead .
you &apos;re going to need to trust me , ok ?
gregor .
gregor , i &apos;m sorry , but silas was going to kill you .
doing it myself was the only way to salvage the deal .
i need his trust .
so you slit my throat ?
you knew the stakes .
it is why we put you inside the person with the invincibility ring .
so now what ?
i am just a passenger that you can call out of
matt &apos;s head and put away whenever you want ?
i will find a way to make this permanent , gregor ,
because i love you , ok ?
and i will do anything , anything for you .
tell me where you buried my body .
ok , but first ,
you will have to dial your friend elena gilbert
and find out where katherine is .
do you have , a , uh , cell phone ?
i have to make a phone call .
there &apos;s no cell reception out here ,
and remember , i made it safe for you here ,
but i wouldn &apos;t go outside if i were you .
no offense , qetsiyah .
i &apos;m having a bit of a hard time believing what you &apos;re saying .
&quot; qetsiyah . &quot; sounds so ...
ancient timey , don &apos;t you think ?
how about tessa ?
it &apos;s a little different but not so different
you wouldn &apos;t find it on one of those souvenir key chains .
so that &apos;s why you rejoined the land of the living ,
souvenir key chains ?
i &apos;m here because the bennett witch lowered the veil .
i saw an opportunity to make myself
a living , breathing mortal ,
and i thought , &quot; why not ? &quot;
my hunters had failed in their task to kill silas .
i figured it was time to handle things in person .
well , 2,000 years is a hell of a long time to hold a grudge .
you have clearly never been left at the altar .
like a lovesick idiot ,
i created an entire garden for our wedding ,
and i made a spell that would keep us alive forever ,
an immortality spell
so we would never have to part .
silas and i were going to drink the immortality elixir
as part of our wedding ceremony .
but then everything around me started to die .
my wedding flower , the garden trellis , our harvest ,
and then i realized why .
silas has already used the immortality spell .
he was already drinking the elixir somewhere else .
he took what he wanted ,
and then the bastard abandoned me .
so call me a woman scorned
or a vindictive bitch or whatever label suits your story ,
but i thought i was his one true love ,
and he ripped my heart out .
i &apos;m sorry .
i deserved a chance to look him in the eye
and make him understand how much he hurt me ,
so i found him in the wilderness
with the woman he gave my immortality to ,
the woman he chose over me ,
and just when i thought his betrayal couldn &apos;t cut any deeper ,
i learned that his actual true love
was someone very close to me ...
my handmaiden .
just as you are mine ,
i am yours forever .
because when i look at you ...
amara ...
all i see is an angel .
so silas was the first version of me ,
and your friend was the first version of elena ?
amara was hardly a friend .
when they drank the immortality elixir ,
they violated the natural law that all living things must die .
so nature found a balance ,
by creating mortal shadow selves .
doppelgangers .
like you .
and katherine
and elena ,
all caused by the ripple effect
from silas and amara &apos;s sin .
you want to tell me what the hell you &apos;ve been doing this whole time ?
silas stole your daylight ring .
you &apos;re going to need a new one .
when this is ready , i need your help
to take down silas once and for all .
are we really just gonna leave her in the car ?
the only time she shuts up is when she &apos;s sleeping .
i didn &apos;t want to disturb our peace and quiet .
i thought you said this was the one .
it is . it looks exactly like it did in the dream .
isn &apos;t that a little freaky ?
yeah . it &apos;s a lot of freaky .
let &apos;s go see if stef &apos;s inside .
can i get you something ?
yeah , sure .
why don &apos;t you tell me what happened to your neck , jo ?
some sicko attacked me , bit me .
told me to run , so i did ,
and when i looked back , he was on fire .
the sun must have come up .
he doesn &apos;t have his daylight ring .
and then what happened ?
some woman shoved him into a truck , drove away .
did you know this woman ?
no . she was driving cam peterson &apos;s truck .
he lives about 10 miles down that dirt road out back .
here . look like you could use one of these .
hmm . i could . thank you .
vervain .
what did you do ?
i told her to pour him a drink ,
or i &apos;d kill her .
who the hell are you ?
which one of you is katherine pierce .
she is .
katherine is a compulsive liar ,
but i need her alive .
katherine , run !
you really do look exactly alike .
wonderful .
now we &apos;ve got a vampire bounty hunter to deal with .
let me guess . eurobitch was not part of the dream .
i &apos;ve never seen her before .
yeah . well , whoever she was , she wants katherine ,
which means she &apos;s probably a silas spy .
i &apos;ll go chase after her .
you find stefan .
wait . what ? no . she almost killed you .
we don &apos;t have time for a detour .
damon , stefan &apos;s hurt . find him .
wait . no .
stop . just wait .
any sign of trouble , you let her go ,
do you understand me ?
i don &apos;t care how bad silas wants katherine .
she &apos;s not worth the hair on your head .
you got me ?
ok .
kiss me .
go .
hovering actually slows down the process .
got it .
so what &apos;s your , uh , plan ?
take the cure and shove it down silas &apos; throat ,
kill him ?
you &apos;re skipping ahead .
we don &apos;t stand a chance against silas with his mental powers .
you took him down before , right ?
a long time ago .
that was before he could compel masses .
and 2,000 years of consuming dribbles of blood from thousands of people ,
it &apos;s allowed him to hone his skills .
it prepared him to escape from the tomb i put him in .
is that where amara is right now ,
locked away in a tomb ?
no , stefan . amara is not locked in a tomb .
what are you doing here ?
i brought you two gifts .
the first is the chalice from which we were to drink at our wedding .
i know you must be very angry with me .
i was ...
for a time ,
but then i realized it was within my power to forgive you
by creating this , your second gift .
a cure for immortality .
that &apos;s not possible .
i promise you , it works .
i just used it on someone else immortal .
what did you do ?
amara !
no .
amara ! no . amara !
no ! no !
she couldn &apos;t speak after i cut her throat ...
but i could tell
by the way her heart was beating ...
she knew she was going to die .
i will kill you , i will kill you !
you will not come near me
unless you take the cure and give up your immortality .
take the cure , silas .
we can live long human lives together .
can &apos;t say i didn &apos;t give him a second chance .
that &apos;s what you call a second chance ?
i &apos;m a complicated person ,
but silas remains a simple man .
i created the other side as a supernatural barrier between silas
and the peaceful afterlife he craved .
then i dropped him in that tomb with that cure ,
thinking eventually he would take it
and kill himself to be with amara .
just so he could realize that he was caught with me for all eternity .
how &apos;s that working out for you ?
he &apos;s been a little stubborn .
i take it you &apos;re not really making me a daylight ring , are you ?
do you really think i &apos;d give you
the one thing you need to walk out of here ?
all right . listen . we &apos;re on the same side .
i want silas gone as much as you do .
have you not been listening to me .
i have trust issues .
i &apos;m controlling
and paranoid
and a little crazy .
and that &apos;s working out just fine .
i &apos;m can &apos;t believe i &apos;m saying this ,
but i &apos;m really glad it &apos;s you .
my leg is cramping , and i &apos;m freezing .
do you mind if i , uh--can i borrow your sweater ?
let &apos;s go before she doubles back .
why didn &apos;t you kill me ?
if silas wants you , that means you &apos;re leverage .
no . i mean , after you shoved the cure down my throat .
i was trying to kill you .
why didn &apos;t you finish me off ?
you think that because we share the same dreams
and both care about stefan that we &apos;re alike ,
but we &apos;re not .
i value my humanity ,
which is why i let you live ,
to give you a chance to find whatever shred
of humanity &apos;s buried underneath 500 years of bad behavior .
or maybe you thought that being human was
punishment worse than death for me .
no . that was just a happy accident .
well ... thank you .
i &apos;m glad to know that you care ,
even if you are a condescending bitch .
do i have to knock you out , too ?
not necessary .
stefan .
you couldn &apos;t call a brother ?
nice to see you , too , damon .
what the hell is going on here ?
well , silas &apos; ex @-@ girlfriend
decided to come back from the other side .
qetsi @-@ whatever ?
it &apos;s qetsiyah .
do you see why i want to change it ?
you won &apos;t be able to break those vines .
the spell won &apos;t release him until i get what i want .
i guess the rumors are true .
you are a ray of sunshine .
question--why is my brother wearing your compost pile ?
i &apos;m going to link stefan to silas .
casting a spell on his doppelganger
will neutralize silas &apos; mental powers .
once he &apos;s weakened , i will force him to take the cure .
that &apos;s a great idea ,
force the cure down his throat .
the cure &apos;s gone , done , it &apos;s ingested .
katherine you mean .
i &apos;m aware of her condition .
she was supposed to be with you .
wait . katherine took the cure ?
we have a lot to catch up on , stefan .
wait a minute . what do you mean supposed to be with me ?
did you plant those dreams ?
what is it , some kind of , like , witch party trick ?
so where is she ?
we ran into a little snag .
then i &apos;ll get started without her .
ok . well , thanks for the hospitality ,
but we should really get going
if we want to beat traffic .
yep , yep . he &apos;s right .
probably don &apos;t want to get on my bad side .
you realize you &apos;re not the only one with a bad side , right ?
aren &apos;t you brave ?
without silas &apos; mental powers , he is an immortal nobody .
we can defeat him .
isn &apos;t that what you want ?
just do it , all right ?
just get it over with . do it .
sorry to sound like a broken record ,
but i like to know the identity of my kidnappers .
who are you , and what do you want ?
ask me again , and i &apos;ll sew your mouth shut .
silas .
of course it &apos;s you .
what are you doing here ?
gps tracker .
it &apos;s even better than a locator spell .
thank you for working so quickly , nadia .
i &apos;m not ready to hand her over yet .
oh , that &apos;s right .
your fascinating unfinished business i don &apos;t care about .
get out of my head .
what are you two talking about ?
let go of her arm .
now i want you to pull out your gun ...
and aim it at your heart .
good .
now pull ...
the trig--ugh !
seriously , what is going on ?
what are you doing to my brother ?
frying silas &apos; brain .
no one said it would be pretty .
all right . we &apos;re done here .
you &apos;re right . we &apos;re done .
it worked .
stefan , stefan !
stef ? damn it .
whatever you did to him , undo it .
relax . i just burned through his conscious mind .
he &apos;ll wake eventually .
you sure you want to take him home ?
you and elena were doing so well ,
without your guilt getting in the way .
spying on us from the other side ?
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
it was like watching a soap opera ,
except boring ,
and with no volume control .
you know , there was one thing worse ,
than being on the other side and watching silas resist the cure .
oh , yeah ? what was that ,
realizing that your plan totally sucked ?
century after century ,
i watched versions of stefan and elena find each other
like magnets , always the same story--
conquering all , falling in love .
you didn &apos;t think your brother was silas &apos; first shadow ?
destiny has been trying to get the doppelgangers together forever .
look here , miss crazy ,
why don &apos;t we just dial down the destiny talk a notch , ok ?
you don &apos;t want to hear it ,
but the universe is working against you .
if you &apos;re trying to downplay your reputation as being a psychopath ,
you might not want to say you &apos;re spokesperson for the universe .
you and i are the same , damon ,
the obstacle standing between two fates .
silas had his true love ,
and stefan has elena .
we &apos;re merely the conflict that makes it interesting .
so what are you suggesting ,
i leave him here with you while i run off
and live happily ever after with elena ?
i &apos;d keep him safe .
you have a bad track record with men .
i want to keep him safe .
now that he &apos;s linked to silas ,
silas can &apos;t mess with our heads .
and as long as stefan &apos;s in the way ,
you will never be with elena .
take it from a woman who &apos;s had front row seats ,
for 2,000 years .
no one would have to know ?
no one has to know .
or you could just go back to hell .
stefan !
stefan !
stefan !
stefan ! hey !
oh , no .
stefan , hey .
stefan , can you hear me ?
stefan !
wake up .
oh , god .
oh , my .
fine . i was snooping ,
trying to find a passport
or a business card or maybe even a parking ticket
because you won &apos;t tell me who you are .
you said you were hungry .
for food , not packaged poison .
suit yourself .
silas the betrayer .
someone lived up to his reputation today .
where are you ?
wouldn &apos;t you like to know ?
you know , i may not be able to read your mind anymore--
it &apos;s too bad you lost the one thing that made you interesting .
but that won &apos;t stop me from killing you
if you don &apos;t hold up your end of the deal .
now whatever twisted fantasy
you &apos;re playing out with katherine is your issue ,
but she stays alive .
we &apos;ll see .
it wasn &apos;t a question .
as you mentioned earlier ,
katherine is still my priority ,
and since i lost my psychic abilities ,
that can only mean one thing .
my ex @-@ fiance is alive again ,
and she &apos;s on her way to mystic falls .
well , maybe you two will get back together .
heh heh . reconciliation isn &apos;t really her thing .
she hates me as much as i hate her ,
and if you think that i don &apos;t play fair ,
wait till you see what she &apos;s capable of .
because qetsiyah and i have some common ground--
neither one of us will stop until we get what we want ,
and both of us want the cure .
enough of the games , silas .
what do you want with me ?
you know , it &apos;s funny .
the love of my life looked exactly like you ,
and yet the mere thought of your face
makes me want to vomit .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about ,
but if i &apos;m nothing but a gag reflex to you ,
why not cut me loose ,
and then we could call it a day ?
because the cure still exists ,
and i still want it .
it &apos;s just running through your veins right now .
your blood is the cure , katherine .
does that clear things up for you ?
hello ?
it &apos;s me .
i just wanted to let you know that we found stefan .
unfortunately , we lost katherine along the way .
are you ok ?
you sounded weird on the phone earlier .
i was worried .
wait . we talked on the phone today ?
when ?
you called and asked me if we found stefan
and if katherine was safe .
i told you where we were headed .
you don &apos;t remember ?
yeah , yeah . i remember .
can i call you back tomorrow ?
ok .
well , he &apos;s got his daylight ring back .
we &apos;re all set for a picnic .
he &apos;s lucky he has a brother who looks out for him .
otherwise , you might have pawned it for a pinball machine .
you &apos;re suspiciously quiet .
tell me what qetsiyah said back at the cabin .
she told me that we don &apos;t stand a chance .
and what does she know about us ?
well , she told me a very interesting little story
about the history of doppelgangers ,
how they &apos;re fated to fall in love with each other .
basically , the universe programmed you
to fall in love with stefan , not me ,
which means ...
we &apos;re a lost cause no matter what we do .
i &apos;m paraphrasing .
the universe ?
her words , not mine .
so she &apos;s crazy ?
maybe . maybe she &apos;s not .
look . i know i spent the last couple days
focusing on trying to find stefan ,
but that has nothing to do with how i feel about you ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let silas &apos; 2,000 @-@ year @-@ old ex @-@ girlfriend
screw things up between us .
you think i am ?
i mean , no one tells me how i live my life ,
no one tells me who i love ,
especially not some vindictive prehistoric witch
and definitely not the universe ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let someone else &apos;s idea of destiny
stop me from loving you or being with you
or building a future with you
because you are my life .
welcome back , brother .
stefan ...
we missed you .
uh , i &apos;m sorry .
i--i have no idea who you people are .
