gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
i &apos;m looking for an ivy dickens .
this is sh--
she ?
i figured as much .
serena &apos;s aunt , carol rhodes ,
paid me to impersonate her daughter charlie .
when these people realize you &apos;re not one of them ,
they &apos;re gonna destroy you .
what do you want ?
i wanna introduce you to your new colleague .
if they &apos;re really your friends ,
they &apos;ll be happy to see your star rise
when everybody learns
that &quot; anonymous &quot; is actually daniel helphrey .
and it is based on you , sort of , all of you .
can you believe what he wrote about me ?
i can tell you from experience everyone loves a villain .
i gave up my career to raise you and i never regretted it
until i read what you really think about me .
personally , i thought you &apos;d be more annoyed
at being conflated with eric .
nate is ...
furious ? yeah , because i am .
and i &apos;m more furious ! he wrote that we had sex !
i want this book , and you &apos;re going to get it for me .
so whatever you did to dan humphrey , undo it .
on the upper east side ,
it &apos;s not what you say that determines who you are .
it &apos;s what you do ...
i hope they take it well . nothing matters more than
our child being born into a big , happy family .
are you ready ?
whether you &apos;re making a big announcement ...
or trying to close a deal ...
hey , jane .
did you lock up the film option for dan &apos;s book yet ?
no , i just finished reading it , unfortunately .
need i remind you , this is your chance to make up
for blowing the daniel day @-@ lewis deal ?
no reminder necessary .
i &apos;m on it .
or firing the first shot .
the site goes live in 20 !
oh , princess sophie ! beatrice ! welcome .
it &apos;s so lovely to see you both again .
we couldn &apos;t be happier .
cyrus , you are still a hugger , i hope ?
is a northern spotted owl still a predator ?
okay .
okay . uh , blair and louis
will be coming down for their big announcement any moment .
this is so mysterious and exciting .
well , whatever it is ,
i &apos;m just so thrilled that it &apos;s happening on yom kippur ,
and i hope the two of you will stay to break the fast with us .
as i recall , you &apos;re quite fond of smoked salmon .
i am , and we would love to .
so ?
allo . les nouvelles ?
we &apos;re gonna have a baby .
a baby ? you &apos;re still in college !
mother .
how wonderful !
wonderful ?
it &apos;s--wh--a wonderful surprise .
uh . what is the record for the
youngest grandmother on the upper east side ?
cyrus , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able to
make it to sundown without eating .
i am thrilled without reservation ...
as long as the baby is born after you are married , of course .
the last thing this family needs is another bastard . oh !
thank you for keeping my secret .
what are sisters for ?
oh , serena , can you stay for the celebration ?
the bun in the oven is a big hit .
i would love to , but i have to get to work .
looks like you have plenty of people to celebrate with ,
and you can tell me about it after .
or i &apos;ll just read about it .
oh ! don &apos;t you look great ?
are you excited about your first day of work ?
i am . wasn &apos;t exactly the job i was looking for ,
but when it fell into my lap , i couldn &apos;t say no .
i really don &apos;t wanna disappointment my boss .
well , i &apos;m sure you won &apos;t . i &apos;ll make dinner tonight ,
and we can hear all about your first day .
you don &apos;t want to go to the break fast at the waldorfs ?
mm , not really in the mood .
oh , isn &apos;t that ironic ?
the state lifts my house arrest , and you lock yourself up .
well , wish me luck . see you tonight .
mm . is that dan again ?
you know , the only way you &apos;re gonna get out of this funk
is to sit down and listen to what he has to say .
i &apos;m not ready yet .
i have to say , when you asked me where you could buy vintage magazines ,
this isn &apos;t what i thought you were talking about .
j.f.k. jr. took a lot of crap by not passing the bar ,
but he redeemed himself by becoming an editor .
i &apos;m just trying to figure out how he did it .
hey , hey , hey ! victor said you were here .
i brought something for you and monkey .
well , i better go before i &apos;m late for work .
nate , don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time to let it go
so we can just be friends again ?
only a whole person could answer that question now , couldn &apos;t they ?
i &apos;m sorry i made you half a character in my novel ,
but you &apos;ve forgiven people for much worse .
well , all right , have a good day , chuck .
thanks .
i can think of a few girls who &apos;d look good in this .
humphrey , i &apos;m feeling like my old self again .
me , too , although not in a good way .
i really thought the days
of everyone turning their backs on me were over .
well , at least this time it &apos;s because they hate you
and not because they don &apos;t know you exist .
be patient .
soon , your literary misdeeds will be forgotten .
along with all your other powers ,
you can add psychic to the list .
if serena can forget ,
then maybe my dad will take my call .
i &apos;ll see you later .
hey . hey . come on , get out of there .
oi ! get ... go on .
can &apos;t we let them finish ?
i &apos;m quite sure it &apos;ll be his loss ,
but , uh , i have patients to see , so ...
you &apos;re a doctor ?
uh , psychologist , yes .
this is kismet .
i &apos;ve been feeling , shall we say , out of sorts , recently .
here .
&quot; dr. eliza barnes . &quot;
chuck bass .
nice to meet you , mr. bass .
come on .
come on .
everyone knows the drill .
as soon as we go live , expect the phones to blow up .
it &apos;s time .
it &apos;s exciting , isn &apos;t it ?
it is .
imitation might be the sincerest form of flattery .
but stealing is an outright crime ,
and that &apos;s what a new rival has committed
when cell phones disappeared and reappeared
at the jenny packham show .
listen , if we launch now ,
everyone will know she was talking about you .
not necessarily .
no , it &apos;s too big of a risk .
abort .
for the moment .
and mother will alter the dress to hide the baby bump .
of course i will , dear .
and louis and i will fly back to be close to dr. crane
for the third trimester .
a honeymoon can wait .
bravo . you &apos;ve got it all figured out .
mother , i think we have a problem .
a baby is never a problem , ma fille .
i hope you won &apos;t try to stir up trouble
and ruin this most happy time .
i &apos;m just trying to protect our family &apos;s history .
blair &apos;s very controlling .
she &apos;s the one making the decisions for the wedding .
she &apos;ll do the same with the child .
louis knows how important a grandchild is to me ,
to monaco .
he will protect the royal tradition .
yes , but will she ?
i &apos;m really glad you came .
i &apos;m glad you called .
enjoy .
thank you .
you know , i think i owe you an apology .
i may have overreacted about how you portrayed me in your book .
thank you so much .
i @-@ i have to admit , it &apos;s been kind of hard .
like , my dad and nate and blair still won &apos;t talk to me .
well , things are looking up then .
one down , three to go ?
mm . never thought you &apos;d be the first .
i am full of surprises . you know that .
so ... how has it been--
everything else , aside from the personal reaction ?
yeah , it &apos;s been an incredible whirlwind .
i just wish i could be sharing it with friends and family .
and , uh , what &apos;s happening with the film rights to the book ?
i don &apos;t know . i hadn &apos;t actually thought about that .
that would be crazy . a movie .
well ...
if you ever decide you wanna turn it into one ,
my boss jane would kill to produce it .
she read the book and loved it .
and she &apos;s an amazing producer , too .
yeah . wow . i mean , thank you . that would be , uh--
i mean , that would be great if that could happen .
yeah .
uh , what do you know ? it &apos;s my agent calling .
i have a ny1 interview i can &apos;t be late for ,
but i &apos;m--i &apos;m really glad we &apos;re okay . can i call you later ?
yeah .
hey , alessandra .
just confirming the ny1 interview .
yeah , i &apos;m on my way .
listen , i just had breakfast with my friend serena ,
who asked about the movie rights ,
and i &apos;d love to give them to her .
how do we go about doing that ?
you are not locking down film rights with somebody
just because they &apos;re your friend .
her boss is , uh , is a big producer , though .
uh , rivington street films ?
she did david o. russell &apos;s next film .
and while that &apos;s great ,
a ton of quality people
want the rights to &quot; inside &quot; , dan .
you had breakfast with someone &apos;s assistant .
i have harvey weinstein on the other line .
whoa . harvey weinstein ? that &apos;s ...
huge . i know . see you soon .
hey , jane , i swallowed my pride and outrage
and did what you asked .
we should have dan &apos;s book later today .
and you had me believe &quot; crazy &quot; was just an act ?
i think you might be suicidal .
what are you talking about ?
you start work here under , shall we say , duress .
and within five minutes ,
there &apos;s a catastrophic leak to my competitor .
diana , i swear it wasn &apos;t me .
since you lie like most people breathe ,
your oath means very little .
now don &apos;t forget , the biggest story i have is you .
if you don &apos;t bring me something better ,
i &apos;m gonna tell the world
that you &apos;re some failed wannabe actress called ivy .
i &apos;ll get you something .
you just have to give me some time .
yom kippur at the waldorfs&apos;
will truly be a &quot; high &quot; holy day ,
now that her royal highness princess sophie
has jetted in from monaco
for a bagel and a schmear .
if i were you , i &apos;d have left by now .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
it seems i now need some launch @-@ worthy stories ,
and she &apos;s the only upper east sider i have
prepared to cross the lines for her career .
look , i care about my career .
i &apos;ll make a name for myself my own way .
if you want to remake yourself ,
you have to do whatever it takes .
give me something , anything ...
on blair waldorf , perhaps ?
but she &apos;s celebrating yom kippur
with her and louis &apos; families , okay ?
i doubt it makes for riveting journalism .
people unable to eat for 24 hours ,
cooped up in an apartment ?
secrets are bound to come out .
call and get me an introduction .
are you even jewish ?
i am today .
this interview is key .
because it &apos;s your first visual appearance in the media .
you wanna make a strong impression .
yeah , am i--am i dressed okay ?
i mean , i wanna seem respectful .
but at the same time , act like this isn &apos;t a huge deal .
not that it is a huge deal ,
&apos;cause , i mean , if it was ...
god , i @-@ i would be , uh , i would be super nervous ,
and i &apos;m totally not .
oh , they have grapes .
dan ... are you with me ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m with you .
these days , a book needs as much press as it can get ,
no matter how many glowing reviews there are .
public television is the last bastion of the intellectual .
if this goes well , charlie rose could be next .
oh , that &apos;s a good tactic-- piling on the pressure
right before your already @-@ prone @-@ to @-@ nervous @-@ rambling client
goes on live television for the first time .
okay .
this is the perfect platform to position your book
as next year &apos;s best picture .
mention harvey &apos;s interest . people in hollywood are sheep .
if someone they respect wants the book , they all will .
i feel like i should call serena .
i don &apos;t want her to think
i was stringing her along at breakfast .
serena knows how the business works ,
and it &apos;s not like you signed a contract .
and if she &apos;s really your friend ,
she &apos;ll be happy for you ,
no matter who gets the rights .
we &apos;re ready .
and let &apos;s go sell some books .
blair , have you thought about
the hospital you plan to deliver the baby in ?
lenox hill , where i was born , as was my mother .
and for school ?
well , i &apos;ve already sent a copy of the sonogram
along with an application to constance st. jude &apos;s .
blair received an exemplary education .
while a new york education may be adequate for a non @-@ royal ,
grimaldis always attend boarding school in switzerland .
furthermore , the child must be born in our wing
at the princess grace hospital centre in monaco .
you can &apos;t seriously expect to
dictate every detail of my grandchild &apos;s life .
but this baby is not just your grandchild .
blair &apos;s life and her family are here in new york .
and louis &apos; are in monaco .
uh , now , ladies .
maman , eleanor , enough .
blair and i will discuss these issues privately .
blair , w @-@ what is it ? are you all right ?
you &apos;ll all have to excuse me .
mr. bass . i was just on my way out .
that &apos;s too bad .
you look like you need to talk .
i do .
yeah , i &apos;ll make time .
thank you .
would you like me seated or ... prone ?
it &apos;s your choice .
so ... mr. bass ,
why are you here ?
well , let &apos;s see .
i recently emerged from a period of prolonged numbness .
starting to feel again physically and emotionally
has made me realize i need to try new things
to prevent a relapse .
new things ?
give me an example .
i &apos;ve had sex on ... almost every conceivable surface ,
but never a therapist &apos;s couch .
so there is that .
i should &apos;ve guessed you weren &apos;t serious .
i &apos;m sure if you got to know me a little better ,
you &apos;d see just how serious i am .
it &apos;s obvious that you &apos;re deeply troubled ,
and i would be more than happy to help
if you were truly interested in therapy .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have yom kippur services .
you &apos;re jewish ?
not that that &apos;s any of your business , but i converted .
well , that &apos;s probably a smart move
in your line of work .
good @-@ bye .
everything okay ?
i &apos;m just worried about rufus .
he and dan are so close .
i just have to figure out a way to get then to connect again .
you &apos;re home early .
we had a rough morning .
my boss is after me to contribute in a big way .
got any leads for me ?
well , with my arrest and rufus &apos; depression ,
we haven &apos;t been out enough to know anything .
but you &apos;re a very smart girl , and i have faith in you .
guess i won &apos;t be needing this hardware
if we &apos;re not going to the waldorfs .
what are those ?
oh , it &apos;s an unfortunate story .
my late husband bart
had his investigator research our whole family .
it was awful .
i meant to transfer them into the safety deposit box ,
but since serena and charles broke into it last year ...
i think it &apos;s safer here .
good luck .
uh , &quot; sabrina , &quot;
dan humphrey &apos;s interview on ny1 started .
he &apos;s talking all about the movie .
... read by anyone but me .
and now i understand
&quot; inside &quot; has caught hollywood &apos;s attention .
well , there &apos;s interest from major producers , like , uh ,
like , uh , scott rudin
and harvey weinstein
and , um , brian grazer ,
but we haven &apos;t made any decisions yet .
is there a director out there who you ...
hey , s. ? i &apos;m sorry to bother you , but i @-@ i needed a walk ,
and i realized i should just come to you .
no , i &apos;m glad you did .
i told jane that i had the option on dan &apos;s book ,
and now it &apos;s like we &apos;re not even on his radar .
can i just ...
uh , look , if i don &apos;t get the rights to this ,
i don &apos;t know what will happen .
i really wanna hear about your working girl woes ,
but ...
i feel like i &apos;m starring in &quot; rosemary &apos;s baby . &quot;
sophie wants to regulate everything about my child &apos;s existence .
she &apos;s insisting that i move to monaco
and leave my whole life here behind .
that sounds horrible .
but can you convince dan to put his movie with our company ?
w--
are you kidding ?
his book is ridiculous and so is he ,
and i really need your help right now .
why are you gossiping when a deal you &apos;re running point on
is falling apart on live television ?
i &apos;m sorry . this is blair , my best friend .
i thought maybe she could help .
this isn &apos;t high school . this is my business .
i told you not to embarrass me .
i have an idea for you .
quit .
your boss is a bitch . let &apos;s go get lunch .
my job is important to me , b.
you have six months to deal with your problem .
i have six minutes to deal with mine . good @-@ bye .
yes .
if everyone else is moving on with their lives ,
then i &apos;m ready to do the same , all the way to monaco .
you &apos;re my family now , louis ,
and i want to be yours .
tell your mother
that i &apos;m going to be a grimaldi ,
and i intend to live like one .
well , look who &apos;s all grown up .
doesn &apos;t feel that way .
what are you doing here ?
i need your help .
i mean trying to bed an older woman ,
and she &apos;s being resistant , and it &apos;s driving me crazy ,
which is ironic , because she &apos;s a shrink .
you speak old lady . what &apos;s my play ?
mm , doesn &apos;t work like that .
same rules apply regardless of age .
you just have to show that you &apos;re
interested in what matters to the woman
more than you &apos;re interested in the woman &apos;s ...
matters .
exactly .
look , i wish i could be more help to you , man , but i--
but what ? i thought you had the m.i.l.f. rules hardwired .
in the bedroom , yeah .
so what else are we talking about ?
we &apos;re talking about serena &apos;s cousin charlie .
she &apos;ll do whatever it takes to succeed at this job ,
and i just--i won &apos;t do it .
diana &apos;s not happy with me .
if only you could be me for a day and i could be you ,
we &apos;d both get what we want .
yeah .
but since we &apos;re not in a jason bateman movie ,
we have to think of another plan .
if charlie &apos;s crossing lines , tag along for a while .
see what it takes .
even j.f.k. jr. had to walk in a few sets of footprints
before he found his own path .
what are you gonna do ?
take an interest in what matters to dr. barnes .
shalom .
where is everybody ?
oh , my mother and beatrice are in the kitchen ,
and your mother and cyrus went to temple .
did you tell them about my decision ?
no .
i felt that we should talk first .
is moving to monaco really what you want ?
i hope you &apos;re not simply bowing to pressure .
reserve the grimaldi birthing suite .
we &apos;re officially a monegasque family .
i knew you would both make the right decision .
thank you .
i love green shrimp .
this is just the fifth night out of seven
that we &apos;ve ordered chinese .
keep looking .
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll find something we &apos;ve never tried .
okay . let &apos;s see .
what about the jade har gow ?
yeah , the glazed prawns would be wonderful .
let &apos;s try the squid ink rice noodles .
you &apos;re just saying that .
hey , guys .
a bit of unsolicited advice ?
if you were to go to the waldorfs &apos; ,
you could avoid having another chinese dinner .
and maybe if you were to see
a family in good working condition ,
it would remind you how important it is to fix yours .
an evening of friends and kugel is just what we need .
ah , comfort food does sound good .
my god , you &apos;d think the jews had suffered enough .
i don &apos;t know how cyrus can stand all this fasting .
i &apos;m eleanor waldorf . uh , who are you ?
this is diana payne .
uh , nate archibald called ahead for me ?
oh , yes . yeah , you &apos;re his boss , the , uh , the journalist .
i have to warn you not to try and wrangle
an interview with my daughter and the prince .
it &apos;s not a good time .
actually , now might be your only chance , diana .
blair didn &apos;t tell you she decided to move to monaco ?
what ?
yes , how you do feel
about your daughter committing to a life away from home ?
please .
blair will do whatever she wants .
waldorf women are not afraid to break the rules .
and besides , who is she hurting if she does ?
it &apos;s not like she &apos;s signing a legally binding contract .
dan &apos;s agent and harvey are close to a deal .
we &apos;re going to lose the project .
i can &apos;t believe this .
really ? i can .
maybe your good friend f. scott fitzjackass
had you nailed in the book .
if something doesn &apos;t fall right into your lap , serena ,
you don &apos;t have a clue how to work for it .
sometimes all it takes to cross a line is a little push .
harvey read the book himself .
apparently , he has all sorts of ideas
and wants to fast @-@ track it for next year .
what ? that &apos;s--that &apos;s ...
incredible , i know , to say the least .
when harvey gets involved , oscars are on the horizon .
that &apos;s his office . one second .
this is alessandra .
he &apos;s canceling ? why ?
what happened ?
apparently , it &apos;s on &quot; deadline &quot;
that you gave the option to jane bettinger ?
what ?
why do i get the feeling
you don &apos;t really want your brother and blair
in monaco ?
my brother &apos;s always been the favorite ,
but he never cared about his title or our family
the way i do .
i had hoped his marriage to blair would mean
permanent exile to new york .
sibling rivalry , backstabbing ,
familial manipulation .
you really are a royal family , aren &apos;t you ?
perhaps i can help you get what you want ...
in return ,
for the inside story of a royal feud .
since i &apos;m feeling a little raw on the family front ,
if eleanor refers to you as &quot; lily bass &quot; again ,
i can &apos;t promise i won &apos;t return fire .
oh , i dragged you here .
you have my full blessing to go sean penn if need be .
thank you .
well , what &apos;s going on in here ?
cyrus , isn &apos;t it time for you to blow the shofar ?
it appears that , uh ,
sophie had legal documents drawn up
regarding the upbringing of our future grandchild .
blair &apos;s supposed to sign these
before sophie returns to monaco tomorrow .
is that absolutely necessary ?
oh , well , let &apos;s not quibble over a signature .
i &apos;m a 21st century girl with 2 lawyers for dads .
i understand the need for paperwork .
some of these requirements are pretty egregious .
any time you take your child out of monaco
for more than six hours ,
you have to inform palace security .
now that &apos;s a little over @-@ the @-@ top .
not for a royal heir . give me your pen .
blair , it says here that you can &apos;t go to yew york
for more than 48 hours at a time .
and furthermore , if you break any of these rules ,
you face the possibility of losing custody of your child
to the royal family .
what ? wait . no , that &apos;s ...
outrageous .
what going on in here ?
i &apos;m not off my meds , but i &apos;ve kind of lost my mind .
safecracking ?
seriously ?
i &apos;m desperate .
if we don &apos;t get something to diana ,
we &apos;re gonna lose our jobs .
there &apos;s a story in that safe . i saw it myself .
oh , god .
i hope the kennedys are rolling over
in their graves right now .
i may have a way to open it .
it used to be chuck &apos;s father &apos;s . just--just give me a second .
你知道范德 · 伍德森家 保险箱的密码吗
thank you , rabbi .
thank you . i &apos;ll see you next time ?
arthur , let &apos;s go around the block .
dan humphrey .
hi .
i recognize you from tv . jane bettinger .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
yeah , i &apos;m looking for serena .
who probably summoned you for me .
i &apos;m a huge fan of your book .
it will make such a great movie .
&quot; gatsby &quot; for the social media age .
so she &apos;s not around ?
she stepped out . maybe i can help .
can you explain to me
why she told nikki finke
that you had the option ?
i &apos;m sorry ? w @-@ what are you talking about ?
serena does work for you , doesn &apos;t she ?
false leaks are for amateurs .
serena said she knew you , she &apos;d get me the book .
i would never have instructed her
to go behind your back to do so .
i &apos;ve known serena forever . i have a hard time believing
that she would sabotage me unless you made her .
serena .
do you have anything to say for yourself ?
jane didn &apos;t make me do it . it was my own idea .
mother &apos;s finally gone mad .
she threatened blair with the loss of her child
if she breaks a rule .
it doesn &apos;t surprise me at all , louis .
you know what a tyrant she can be .
mother , how could you do this ?
excuse me .
it &apos;s a simple custody agreement .
a &quot; simple custody agreement &quot;
does not allow you to take our child from us
if you don &apos;t like something blair chooses to do .
what are you talking about ?
you wrote this , didn &apos;t you ?
yes , but i didn &apos;t put in any such clause .
it was probably a mistake ,
mistranslated by dominique as you dictated the terms to her .
it was no mistake , beatrice .
you must have put it there .
yes , i did .
blair has no respect for our traditions
or the monarchy .
she &apos;ll do whatever she wants with that child .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;d betray us like this .
obviously , sophie , you &apos;ll remove that clause .
my daughter &apos;s actions may have been underhanded and deceitful ,
but ...
your reaction makes me think that she might be right .
if you really want to embrace my family ,
you will have no problem signing this contract .
the clause stays .
if you two cannot accept this ,
then i will not acknowledge the child as my heir .
nor will i acknowledge you .
you don &apos;t have that right anymore .
as the future reigning prince ,
it &apos;s up to my child
to acknowledge you .
we are done talking , louis .
i wish you could find it in yourself
not to make this terrible mistake .
it is you who is mistaken--
throwing away your loyal family
for a fiancee you shouldn &apos;t trust .
do you realize that blair told beatrice that she was pregnant
long before she told you ?
do you really believe she has no other secrets ?
it &apos;s true it &apos;s been a bit of a journey .
but i trust blair .
i know all of her secrets .
my darling .
how innocent you are .
i only wish for your sake that is true .
good @-@ bye .
i know that you have always felt overlooked ,
but no more .
all i &apos;ve ever wanted was your love and respect .
this is the mother lode--
the biggest secrets of the upper east side .
even one of these would not only launch the web site
but blow diana &apos;s mind .
and my ethics . these are my friends .
now that i &apos;ve actually done this ,
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
all right , i don &apos;t even wanna look at them ,
much less hand them over ,
so let &apos;s just put them back ,
pretend this never happened .
if i show up to work empty @-@ handed ,
i &apos;ll lose my job .
all right , i know how important it is for you to succeed .
it is for me , too .
but we &apos;ll find something else .
what about all that stuff you said to me about the kennedys ?
isn &apos;t that why you texted me ,
because you know you won &apos;t get where you wanna be
unless you bend the rules a little ?
charlie , these might be my friends ,
but they &apos;re your family ,
and you &apos;re acting like you barely even know them .
oh , my god .
i ...
you &apos;re totally right .
you know , i &apos;m gonna put them back ,
and you should just go .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m really--i &apos;m sorry .
no , hey , don &apos;t be sorry .
all right , i know what it &apos;s like to feel the pressure
to make a name for yourself .
but you belong here .
you &apos;ll find your place eventually , the right way .
i just donated $ 100,000 to chabad
to find out which temple you attend .
the least you could do is give me a minute of your time .
you could &apos;ve had 50 , but you wasted them .
knowing your reputation , i expected nothing less
than an entirely inappropriate manipulation .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that simple .
you asked for my professional opinion ,
and now you &apos;re gonna get it .
you never had a childhood ,
and so you behave like a child in the worst ways .
you pay for intimacy so you &apos;re always in control
and no one can get close to you .
your superficial connections and lack of authentic emotion
leave you isolated and alone .
not just tonight . always .
i wish you all the best ,
but you &apos;re gonna need more than that
to live a happy and normal life .
i followed jane all the way down to her town car , apologizing ,
and even then , i don &apos;t think it was enough .
thank you for waiting .
i didn &apos;t want to .
you scared away everyone ,
and now no one wants the book .
dan .
your apology this morning was just strategic , wasn &apos;t it ?
yeah , pretty much .
look , i finally finished the book and--
i told you , it--it &apos;s not you .
yes , there are-- there are parts of you ...
艾米 · 马奇 &#91; 《 小妇人 》 中被宠坏的小女儿 &#93;
and daisy buchanan and amy march
and gwyneth paltrow--
five different roles she &apos;s played .
but it &apos;s a novel .
it &apos;s inspired by a lot of things .
it isn &apos;t speaking to some deeper truth .
are you sure ?
because ...
i know this may sound ...
crazy or--or selfish
or like i &apos;m living in the past ...
or something .
but you were the love of my life , dan .
and i don &apos;t know . i ...
i guess i just thought i was yours , too .
that &apos;s the thing about writing what you know .
soon everybody else knows it , too .
the spectator online lives .
let &apos;s see gossip girl scoop this .
i told you it &apos;d work out . she found something ,
and we didn &apos;t have to sell out our friends ...
or ourselves .
yeah , you &apos;re right , and , uh , looks like my job is safe .
yeah .
at least for the moment .
and thanks again .
for helping me ... do nothing .
well , it was fun breaking into the safe , wasn &apos;t it ?
okay , everyone , now the real work begins .
get to your desks and start writing .
i want a constant stream of content 24 hours a day .
oh , charlie , come back to my office in five minutes .
blair , darling ,
i have to confess that , um , i may have been the one
to put the idea of a contract into beatrice &apos;s head .
i was just bragging about you ,
and it didn &apos;t matter where you lived .
no one could keep you from being your own person .
and that is part of why you will be ...
a wonderful mother .
thank you for saying that .
i know this isn &apos;t what you wanted for me .
at least not yet .
these things happen when they happen .
it &apos;s the first lesson of being a parent .
children don &apos;t do ...
what you want them to do all the time
when you want them to do it .
but you love them ...
anyway .
well , i bet you never thought you &apos;d hear
such good parenting advice from eleanor waldorf .
it &apos;s time for me to let my anger go and return dan &apos;s calls .
i mean , if he didn &apos;t piss me off ,
it &apos;d just mean he wasn &apos;t growing up .
that is the rufus humphrey that i love .
i &apos;m so relieved i don &apos;t have to live my entire life
on one square mile of jagged coastline .
i belong here with my family ,
that respects my hopes and dreams .
i hope that includes me .
can we talk , b. ?
when you told me you were pregnant ,
i said that i would be there for you ,
no matter what , and i haven &apos;t been .
and i &apos;m sorry .
well , you had a work crisis .
yeah , but the truth is that i was jealous .
well , if it makes you feel better , marrying a prince
isn &apos;t what fairy tales will lead you to believe .
well , that &apos;s not what i was jealous about .
you &apos;re the star of dan &apos;s book .
well , as i said ...
it &apos;s pure fiction .
oh . i wanted to return these to you .
and ... you &apos;re not gonna use them ever ?
anything of value in these was already on &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
and everything else was far too tame .
just put them back before anyone notices they &apos;re gone .
oh , charlie ? you forgot one .
hey . uh ... i thought about what you said earlier .
and how can either of us know who the loves of our lives are
until we &apos;re , uh ... until we &apos;re old , you know ?
i mean , this--this thing &apos;s not over yet , right ?
i told alessandra that i &apos;m giving you the book rights .
no , you don &apos;t have to do that .
i wasn &apos;t trying to guilt you into it .
no , i know , i know ,
but without you inspiring me from the beginning ,
i wouldn &apos;t have been able to write anything , so ...
i owe you one .
and despite the events of the day ,
you know , i trust you .
i do have one condition .
i want to write the screenplay .
i &apos;ll talk to jane right away .
all right .
oh , you know what ? that &apos;s my dad .
uh , he &apos;s on the other line . i &apos;ll see you soon though .
yes , in very long development meetings .
okay .
hey , dad .
as challenging as atoning can be ,
the rewards make it worth the sacrifice .
everything you said to me was true .
i don &apos;t need another notch on my belt .
i need help .
i knew it last week . hell ,
i knew it last year . i know it now .
i &apos;m ready to be serious if you &apos;ll ... have me .
hello ?
but the most difficult part can be admitting
that there was a sin to begin with .
most people find it too hard to face their crimes
and think it &apos;s easier just to pretend nothing ever happened .
what are you doing up here all alone ?
waiting for you .
oh , i was looking for a pen .
i &apos;m sorry you had to choose between me and your mother .
it &apos;s the last thing i wanted .
you &apos;re my only family now .
i &apos;m gonna go run a bath .
the problem with hiding your sins
is they always come back .
and on the day when some have atoned for past transgressions ,
a once @-@ pure prince can &apos;t help but commit a new one .
i have a problem i was hoping you could help me with .
i &apos;d like to meet so i could tell you more in person .
i &apos;m more than willing to pay for your time .
