the winner gets a $ 20,000 scholarship .
we &apos;re gonna have to pay for my tuition somehow .
you &apos;re not pageant material .
i &apos;m not doing that pageant .
well , i am , for you .
any chance wren still has that contact at oxford ?
if i don &apos;t make honor roll this semester
they can completely withdraw my acceptance .
if you need a tutor ...
i &apos;m eric , talia &apos;s husband .
you told him i was an experiment , a one time thing .
if you are &quot; a , &quot; you &apos;re counting on that last little shred of me
that gives a damn about what happens to you .
and you shouldn &apos;t .
&quot; thanks for donating to my get @-@ into @-@ jail fund . - a. &quot;
you have something that belongs to us , cyrus .
well , maybe we could work out a trade .
and when i find out who &quot; a &quot; is , alison gets out of jail ,
and your sister and her friends are finely safe .
do you think that &quot; a &quot; double @-@ crossed mona and killed her ?
why are you so sure that alison isn &apos;t &quot; a &quot; ?
cyrus told me that &quot; a &quot; had him get alison out of town that day .
do we tell alison ?
we destroyed a lot of evidence
that could have proved that she was innocent .
well , are we gonna say anything before her trial ?
we have to .
did you hear back from hanna ?
i don &apos;t know .
they have our cell phones .
oh , right .
this feels weird .
yeah , of course , it feels weird .
we &apos;re in a locked room with razor wire on the roof .
no , i mean coming here with our tail between our legs .
you don &apos;t think we owe her an apology ?
aria , we formed a human blockade .
she &apos;s locked in a cell because of us .
no , she &apos;s locked in a cell because of karma .
well , and because of us .
hey , look , no one is saying that she &apos;s a saint .
or even a decent human being .
but she &apos;s on trial for a murder that she didn &apos;t commit .
mona set her up and then was killed herself ,
and now ali &apos;s going down for it .
i wouldn &apos;t wish that on my worst enemy .
well , she &apos;s definitely runner @-@ up .
he was scared to say anything .
he still thought mona was alive
and he didn &apos;t want to put her in danger .
so her plan was to just let me rot in here ?
only until she found out who &quot; a &quot; was ,
but then she was going to come back .
and you &apos;d be released .
but now she--
she &apos;s not coming back .
we &apos;re gonna figure out a way to get you out of here .
where &apos;s hanna ?
she really wanted to be here ,
but she had to spend the day with her mom .
your visiting hour is over .
let &apos;s go , girls .
we &apos;ll be back soon , okay ?
aria ?
you know i &apos;m gonna have to tell my lawyers about mike , right ?
ali , please don &apos;t do that .
his testimony might be the only thing that can save me .
can you just hold off ?
please ?
just let me find cyrus , maybe he can lead me to &quot; a. &quot;
you &apos;ve been looking for &quot; a &quot; --
no , we &apos;ve been trying to find &quot; a &apos;s &quot; henchman .
we thought that &quot; a &quot; was in a jail cell .
okay .
i will-- i &apos;ll wait .
but ...
i want you to know i &apos;m not trying to hurt him .
i just might not have another choice .
where were you ?
i &apos;m sorry , you guys , i chickened out .
i couldn &apos;t go back there .
not after calling her a liar and a murderer to her face .
she is a liar .
up until yesterday ,
we all thought she was a murderer , too .
well , you guys didn &apos;t make a personal appearance
to cut her open , pour salt in the wound ,
and then exfoliate it .
was she upset ?
i don &apos;t know .
your absence kind of took a second position
to the bomb we had to drop about mona .
after we left , ali was still pretty much in a state of shock .
which apparently is contagious .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m fine .
is this about your brother ?
look , if we don &apos;t figure out who &quot; a &quot; is
before ali &apos;s trial starts--
she &apos;s going to feed mike to her defense team .
can they make him take the stand ?
yeah . he &apos;ll be a hostile witness .
no , you guys , it &apos;s not about him getting in trouble with the law .
once mike becomes ali &apos;s get @-@ out @-@ of @-@ jail @-@ free card ,
he also becomes &quot; a &apos;s &quot; number one target .
no , you don &apos;t have to come to the house ,
peter , i can handle it .
she just walked in .
i &apos;ll call you later .
i thought you and dad weren &apos;t really talking .
we weren &apos;t .
but when our daughter is making field trips to prison ,
i figure i owe him a jingle .
this family has bent over backwards
to keep you out of that place ,
and now you &apos;re voluntarily showing up there ?
mom , it &apos;s the first time i &apos;ve even gone to visit alison--
and your last .
this series of poor choices ends today .
if you &apos;re going to skip school ,
then it &apos;s going to be so you can get into a better one .
费城国际机场至伦敦希思罗机场
london ?
i spoke to wren , and he managed to get you a--
you called wren ?
you hate wren .
well , i &apos;m not holding out for jonny raymond &apos;s
connections to pull through .
wren got you an interview with a very well @-@ respected
professor at oxford .
you &apos;ll be staying with him and melissa .
your plane leaves tonight .
so if i were you , i &apos;d start packing .
have a nice day .
emily ?
hi .
i &apos;m claire handelman .
hi .
i &apos;ve had your picture staring up at me from my desk .
i &apos;m the contestant coordinator
of the glass slipper collective .
oh . hi .
was everything okay with my application ?
actually , no .
you forgot a parent &apos;s signature .
oh , sorry .
i must &apos;ve missed that .
my mom is visiting my dad at his base .
can she fax her permission ?
sure , no problem .
what &apos;s this ?
oh , the event &apos;s calendar .
meet and greet , pancake breakfast , orientation .
each one of you is also assigned a fairy godmother
to help you walk through it .
it &apos;s our version of a den mother .
we keep you girls very busy .
oh , i had no idea it was such a time commitment .
well , is that gonna be a problem ?
no , no , not at all .
um , my boss is out of town for the day ,
but when he gets back i &apos;ll talk to him about swapping some shifts .
oh , you tell your boss
you &apos;re a very promising contestant .
i only wish you &apos;d started sooner .
you could have collected a couple of glass slippers by now .
this has to be a quick visit , girls .
she is upstairs in her room .
thank you .
mrs. hastings ?
can i ask you something ?
a legal question .
sure .
i don &apos;t really know where to start .
it &apos;s kind of personal .
uh , aria , i &apos;m happy to talk to you ,
but i @-@ i need you to understand something .
you and i don &apos;t have attorney @-@ client privilege .
what does that mean exactly ?
simple answer ?
i may not be able to keep whatever you tell me
just between us , even if i want to .
i know it &apos;s not your usual rate ,
but for the next hour will you be my lawyer ?
talia ? can i talk to you ?
i know amanda was going to be helping you
in the kitchen this week ,
but something &apos;s come up ,
and i was hoping she could cover my shifts instead .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;ll be possible .
really ?
this is how it &apos;s going to be ?
i mean , i didn &apos;t say what i said to hurt you .
it &apos;s not about that , emily .
today is my last day .
i already told ezra . i quit .
was this person involved in the crime directly ?
no .
but he did have information
that could really help the police .
and he was aware of that ?
yeah .
and he withheld it ?
yeah .
well , without being familiar with any of the particulars ,
i &apos;d say that if he impeded a police investigation
knowingly , then , yes ,
he &apos;d definitely face charges .
what-- what kind of charges ?
like , jail time ?
it depends on the nature of the crime .
all right . well , what if it were serious
and someone ended up getting killed ?
how much trouble would he be in ?
a lot .
spencer , you cannot leave now !
we just found out that ali isn &apos;t &quot; a &quot;
and we still don &apos;t know who &apos;s trying to turn us into a chain @-@ gang .
well , what am i supposed to do , hanna ?
miss your flight .
please .
do not think that my mom won &apos;t be waiting in duty @-@ free
just to make sure i catch the next one .
what did toby say about this ?
i don &apos;t know . i didn &apos;t tell toby .
the only way to get his attention these days
is over a police scanner .
can your mom postpone the interview ?
if you have any suggestions on what you think
i should say to her , i &apos;m all ears .
why not tell the truth ?
what ? i think it &apos;s time that you finally come clean
and you ask your mom for help .
are you serious ?
hanna , we can &apos;t do that .
why not ?
maybe hanna &apos;s right .
what do we have to lose ?
uh , my brother .
aria , spencer &apos;s mom can help mike .
no , she can &apos;t help us find &quot; a. &quot;
you guys , do we really want to rattle &quot; a &apos;s &quot; cage by telling now ?
we all know what happens when we do that .
dilaurentis .
come with me .
mrs. hastings .
what are you doing here ?
i want to know why my daughter and her friends
are visiting you all of a sudden .
shouldn &apos;t you ask your daughter that ?
she won &apos;t give me an answer .
so i thought i &apos;d get it straight from the horse &apos;s mouth .
i &apos;ve heard that your own brother
refuses to come here .
so why would these girls ?
because i &apos;m telling the truth .
i shouldn &apos;t be here .
and they know that now .
unfortunately , alison , with the lies you &apos;ve told ,
even if your friends believe you ,
it &apos;s doubtful a jury will .
that &apos;s why i want to take the stand .
i want to tell my side of the story .
but my lawyers won &apos;t let me .
your lawyers are right .
you could say the wrong thing
and wind up incriminating yourself .
but i can &apos;t just sit here quietly
while someone gets up there
and tries to make me look like a murderer .
alison , you &apos;ve told so many lies .
people know that now .
and not just in rosewood .
your lawyers are going to have a hard time
finding a juror willing to believe you .
i want to tell my side , because , for once , it &apos;s the truth .
well , i don &apos;t know what to say .
what will you say to spencer ?
she was almost in this room .
i know what people think about me .
and i know it &apos;s hard to change someone &apos;s mind
once it &apos;s made up .
but i have to try .
then you &apos;ll need a very good coach .
mrs. hastings ?
will you do it ?
will you be my coach ?
did you forget about me ?
oh , my god , andrew .
we had a session scheduled for tonight , didn &apos;t we ?
yep .
i &apos;m so sorry . i totally spaced .
have you been waiting out here long ?
no .
just long enough to start anna karenina ,
and finish it .
don &apos;t worry about it .
the cold war awaits . shall we get started ?
andrew ...
i feel terrible about flaking , but ...
can we just hold off on the study sessions
for a while , maybe ?
okay .
but if you &apos;re gonna blow off studying ,
how about squeezing in a movie ?
i got two tickets to a screening of all the president &apos;s men .
tonight ?
tomorrow . at the art house theater downtown .
what do you say ?
andrew , yeah , i-- i &apos;d like to .
but is this a date ?
i don &apos;t know . is it ?
no , well , it can &apos;t be .
i &apos;m still sort of seeing ezra .
sort of ?
no , i am .
sort of .
well , you seem less sure about that than you did
about the three branches of government ,
but don &apos;t sweat it .
we &apos;ll go as friends .
friends .
study buddies .
besides , the movie is about watergate .
so it &apos;s like a civics and history lesson rolled into one .
sounds entertaining .
you won &apos;t be sorry .
it &apos;s a thriller about getting messages from a shadowy figure
who knows everybody &apos;s secrets .
it &apos;s a wild stuff , right ?
i &apos;ll see you later .
bye .
sorry , i &apos;ve messed up the wrong apartment .
flat .
what ?
apartments are flats .
trucks are lorries .
sweaters are jumpers .
and now that we have all that sorted ,
you must be spencer .
i &apos;m colin .
wren and melissa &apos;s flatmate .
welcome to london .
thank you .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ll be playing your host for the next 24 hours .
wren and melissa won &apos;t be back until tomorrow night .
my sister isn &apos;t even here ?
wren &apos;s boss invited them to his country home in kent .
i imagine after your flight you &apos;re a bit peckish .
how do you feel about ...
stale biscuits ?
i stole these from a child &apos;s lunchbox .
i have 23 of them .
children , not biscuits .
not my children , students .
let &apos;s start over .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m not hungry .
it &apos;s quite a ways for you to come for an interview .
you must really have your heart set on oxford .
yeah , i do .
which college ?
what ?
there are 38 of them within the university .
right , i &apos;m interested in a few of them actually .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t access my data
and i really have to text my friends .
can you please help ?
at the risk of sounding like a nosy git ,
may i suggest that in light of your impending interview
that you tuck away your mobile
and pick up a course catalogue ?
or you can tell me to bugger off .
thank you .
i &apos;m just here to pick up my last check .
are you going on a trip ?
not exactly .
after what you said , i had a talk with eric .
a real talk .
i was pretty open with him
and it didn &apos;t go so well .
we &apos;re separating .
talia , did i make you have a conversation
you weren &apos;t ready to have ?
it was going to happen sooner or later .
so what are you gonna do ?
well , i booked a hotel over by another catering gig .
so as long as there &apos;s hot water and clean sheets ,
i &apos;ll stay there for a while .
but after that ?
i don &apos;t know .
look , if you need a place to stay for the next few days ,
you can crash at my house .
your mom would be okay with that ?
she &apos;s away .
thank you .
yeah , that would be great .
yeah .
didn &apos;t you tell me there &apos;s a way to see
if someone &apos;s read the email you sent them ?
not if you didn &apos;t attach the thing
you need to attach to do it .
how do you know i didn &apos;t ?
did you ?
i sent my resume for a few job openings .
i haven &apos;t heard back from any of them .
i &apos;m gonna take this upstairs .
where have you been ?
i covered for you in school , but--
my brother is on borrowed time , hanna .
i can &apos;t be sitting in spanish conjugating verbs .
i really need to talk to cyrus .
you think we &apos;re going to find &quot; a &quot; through cyrus ?
you &apos;re lucky if you can even find cyrus .
i already did .
so i went back to the diner looking for a lead ,
and i found one .
turns out hank mahoney is a regular
and he works as a mechanic at a garage
like an hour and a half away .
aria , you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
no , so when i got there , the shop manager told me
that hank was injured while he was working on a car .
stop saying hank , it &apos;s confusing .
so where is cyrus ?
he &apos;s being treated at taft memorial hospital .
i called , but he can &apos;t have visitors until tomorrow .
hanna , we need to go down there and talk to him
before he disappears again .
wait , why are you willing to go down this road
with a guy who tried to run you over with his hog ?
when mike met up with him ,
cyrus admitted that he was paid to set ali up .
so if we can just talk to him again ,
maybe he can give us some sort of insight
into who contacted him .
why would he tell us now ?
because we &apos;ll ask nicely ?
because we &apos;re willing to pay him .
no . no .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m sorry .
emily &apos;s already popping and locking my way into college .
fine .
all right , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll figure something out .
but you have to come with me .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
i mean , he &apos;s kind of a scary guy .
yeah , well , he &apos;s also our only link to the real &quot; a. &quot;
spencer hastings .
pleasure to meet you .
nonsense .
the pleasure is all mine .
please .
thank you .
so tell me , miss hastings .
why do you wish to further your education
away from the colonies ?
well , why stay in america ?
i believe it was william fulbright
who said that international education
is our best opportunity to turn ideologies into human aspirations .
with that being said ,
how could i do any better than the oldest university
in the english @-@ speaking world ?
who are you again ?
we &apos;re his cousins .
you can &apos;t bring those in .
both of you , use this on your hands please .
front and back .
put these on .
are you sure that this is really necessary ?
we &apos;re just gonna go see him for a second .
and that &apos;s all the time you &apos;ll get .
but i &apos;m not going to risk you giving him
or any of the other patients an infection .
burn unit ?
you didn &apos;t tell me that .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t know .
i thought he had a broken leg or something .
excuse me ?
no net ? no visit .
so the tailor looks at the pants and says , &quot; euripides ? &quot;
and the gentleman replies , &quot; yes , eumend @-@ ides . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna need to add that one to my repertoire
of philosophical knock @-@ knock jokes .
well , it &apos;s a shame you &apos;re not staying longer to meet
professor heath .
she teaches a course on mythology and modern literature
that i think you &apos;d find quite diverting .
i would be happy to write a note
introducing myself to her if you wouldn &apos;t mind--
what is that ?
i ...
what have you got in there ?
i ...
is that ...
i-- i really don &apos;t know how this happened .
i-- i need to wash my hands .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re really good .
i just came to drop off your key .
guess you didn &apos;t get my text .
no .
i was rehearsing for this pageant thing .
you don &apos;t sound thrilled , why do it ?
i &apos;m doing it for a friend .
to help her win money .
sorry . don &apos;t buy it .
what ?
i don &apos;t buy it .
the way you just danced ?
nobody works that hard for just the money .
to get the money i have to win it .
it &apos;s not like i can half @-@ ass it .
okay .
it &apos;s for hanna .
emily , it was a compliment .
but , yeah , maybe it &apos;s for me , too .
i guess i just never really saw you
as the beauty pageant type .
i &apos;m not .
but that &apos;s part of it .
you know , i @-@ i keep thinking if i work hard and win this ,
then i &apos;ll know i have it in me
to take control of my life .
that must sound pretty stupid .
not at all .
come on .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re gonna dance with me .
mr. mahoney ? you have visitors .
hey , cyrus , we wanted to come talk to you ,
but we didn &apos;t realize you &apos;d been in such a bad accident .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s no accident .
what do you mean ?
wait , are you saying someone did this to you ?
cyrus , what happened ?
here .
carjack .
okay , time to say goodbye .
can we just have two more minutes ?
i &apos;m sorry .
please , two more minutes is all we need .
i &apos;m not here for your needs .
my job is to take care of your cousin .
well , he would want us to stay longer .
i understand .
but what mr. mahoney needs right now is rest .
spencer ?
spencer , slow down .
there was blood everywhere ! okay ?
i threw out the purse , but what if somebody finds it
and they turn it in ?
whose blood is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s mine or yours or mona &apos;s ?
oh , my god .
i think i &apos;m going to be sick .
spencer , you really need to calm down , okay ?
how ? do you know what this means ?
it means that &quot; a &quot; put it in my bag before i got to the airport .
if they had it found it in the x @-@ ray machine
i would still be there .
i would be getting grilled by dozens of federal agents .
but you &apos;re not .
all right ? luckily you found them .
aria , i &apos;m freaking out , okay ?
i want to come home .
so come home , spence .
i can &apos;t .
how am i supposed to get on a plane ?
what if they find a pinky @-@ toe
in my checked luggage ?
well , apparently you &apos;re not the only one being targeted .
why , what do you mean ?
&quot; a &quot; put cyrus in the hospital .
and i &apos;m guessing it &apos;s punishment for meeting mike .
what ? how ?
yeah , it looks like &quot; a &quot; hurt cyrus
and tried to make it look like a carjacking .
aria , i really-- i can &apos;t be hearing this right now .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to make it worse .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
i &apos;m just gonna go back in there--
miss , you better take a step back
or i &apos;m gonna have to call security .
hey , spencer , i have to go .
那里流出来的血更多 a
step and back and step and over .
turn .
i can &apos;t do it .
yes , you can . okay , mirror me .
come on .
okay .
step and back and step and over .
turn ...
drop .
come on .
come on .
next time wear pants .
i could &apos;ve taken her .
no , you couldn &apos;t have .
well , you could have distracted her .
what do you want me to ? juggle ?
something !
god , the prison guards were less intimidating .
i mean , i took one step towards that room
and she flew over that desk like crouching tiger , hidden dragon .
and meanwhile , &quot; a &quot; is tying up loose ends
and cyrus is one of them .
wait , this &quot; c &quot; is a &quot; v. &quot;
look .
what ?
it &apos;s not &quot; carjack . &quot;
we read it wrong . it &apos;s &quot; varjack . &quot;
cyrus wasn &apos;t trying to tell us what happened .
he was trying to tell us who did it .
you think that &quot; a &quot; is going by the name &quot; varjak &quot; ?
why not ?
i mean , spencer always said how ali was obsessed
with breakfast at tiffany &apos;s .
she turned into holly for that fake passport .
maybe &quot; a &quot; is taunting her by being paul varjak .
cyrus spelled it wrong .
that &apos;s awesome .
why is that awesome ?
it just means he &apos;s a bad speller .
or it means that he &apos;s never seen it written down .
that &quot; a &quot; hasn &apos;t contacted him through email or text .
they spoke .
did you find a bedbug ?
no , i &apos;m just repacking .
can i , um , borrow your laptop ?
i want to change my flight .
just let me put the food down .
actually , maybe you could call me a cab .
i want to go home , tonight .
before your sister returns ?
i just-- i just really need to go home .
spencer ?
hey , spencer , take a moment--
please , i just need to pack .
you &apos;re having a panic attack .
no , this is just what it looks like when i pack .
what happened ?
will you get out of my way ?
i teach primary school , and when one of my kids is having a bit of a day
because a girl won &apos;t share her crayons
or a boy ate the color blue ,
i take them through a relaxation exercise .
look , i didn &apos;t eat a crayon , okay ?
i &apos;m just dealing with oversized toiletries right now .
humor me .
close your eyes .
focus on your breath .
imagine the breath going deep into your belly ,
surrounding all that nervous energy ...
and letting it out .
do you want to talk about it ?
no .
okay .
well , then can you at least leave the bedbugs
and let me make you something to eat ?
emily .
hi , claire .
i stopped by your work .
they told me you were rehearsing here .
yeah . my routine for the competition .
is everything okay ?
my mom said that she sent over the--
no , i got her signature .
that isn &apos;t why i &apos;m here .
emily , when you filled out the application ,
did you read the entire thing ?
yeah , i mean ...
i think so , except for the permission part .
the application form explicitly mentions
that all contestants must be of good moral character .
i &apos;m not following .
you should have at least mentioned it to me .
you must &apos;ve known you would make the board
apprehensive by you participating as a contestant .
more than apprehensive .
are you forcing me to drop out ?
we can &apos;t force you to do anything .
only encourage you .
you don &apos;t want me in the pageant
because of who i date ?
are you serious ?
this is about your close connection to the alison dilaurentis case .
the board is concerned that if you participate ,
our sponsors will drop out
to avoid any negative association .
hey , sweetie .
did you hear back about a job ?
no , not yet .
ted called .
we went for a walk and talked
and ...
the rest is history .
okay .
that response really put the &quot; luke &quot; in lukewarm .
no i &apos;m , i &apos;m happy for you .
i &apos;m confused .
aren &apos;t you the one who convinced me to go back to ted
and ask for his forgiveness ?
i know . i just ...
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that he made you
twist in the wind for so long .
hanna ...
i &apos;m glad that he took the time to think about it .
if he &apos;d just said &quot; okay &quot; right away ,
that wouldn &apos;t have been honest .
he needed to come to it on his own time .
well , didn &apos;t that make you sort of wish
you hadn &apos;t apologized ?
no .
i feel awful about what i did ,
and i needed to say that .
not only for him to forgive me ,
but for me to forgive myself .
i really am fine .
thank you for everything .
of course .
talia ?
what are you doing ?
just trust me , okay ?
i followed your lead , now you follow mine .
miss handelman ?
oh . i &apos;ve really got to get going .
emily just wanted you to know
that she understands the board &apos;s position .
well , i &apos;m sorry it had to come down to this .
me , too .
we &apos;re just concerned that if anyone found out
you wanted her to drop out
because of a friendship she has--
that friend is on trial for murder .
but in this country ,
you &apos;re innocent until proven guilty .
unless the pageant judges know better than the ones
on the supreme court .
are you threatening me ?
i &apos;m encouraging you .
perhaps your sponsors could make a donation
toward emily &apos;s education .
did you seriously just ask her to send me a check ?
they &apos;re not going to do that .
you never know .
did you talk to mike ?
does he have any idea who varjak is ?
i can &apos;t find mike .
he might be at a game .
i &apos;m looking for his schedule right now .
han , i &apos;m gonna call you back .
aria ? you home ?
yeah , i &apos;m up here .
what happened ?
are you okay ?
yeah .
yeah , i was just standing on that thing and it broke .
that &apos;s weird .
what ?
the nut and bolt don &apos;t match .
if your brother had been on this ,
the weights would have crushed his skull .
this hurt ?
yeah , a little .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s broken ,
but you might have a sprain .
what were you doing on top of that thing anyway ?
i was just grabbing something
from the board up there .
see ? that &apos;s why we need to hang out more .
i &apos;m basically a human stepladder .
you know , for such a petite girl ,
you bring a lot of chaos .
it &apos;s not that i mind chasing down angry bikers
with a baseball bat , &apos; cause , i mean , i don &apos;t .
i like problems .
math equations , jigsaw puzzles ,
complicated girls ,
they don &apos;t scare me .
but what does scare me is this swelling .
we might need to get a doctor to look at this .
it &apos;s okay .
here . go to town .
it &apos;s okay .
spencer , call me as soon as you get this .
i want you to cancel your flight home .
i brought you some magazines .
but they took them .
yeah ...
you have to go through the canteen .
yeah , they told me .
i &apos;ll do that .
ali , i &apos;ve been thinking about what i said to you .
hanna , please don &apos;t apologize .
when i first got here ,
i kept thinking ,
&quot; how did this happen ?
what did i do to deserve this ? &quot;
i honestly thought that i was helping you guys .
telling you what to wear ,
how to act , who to like .
and when you stopped listening ,
i found new people who would .
being here ?
no one listens to me .
i can &apos;t even decide
what to wear , what to eat ...
and when to shower .
i &apos;m told everything .
everything &apos;s an order .
i never realized
how bad that felt ,
to be on the other side of that .
so i &apos;m sorry .
do you think that we could start over ?
i don &apos;t know .
but we could try .
but only if you &apos;re honest with us ...
about everything .
okay .
alison ?
who is varjak ?
