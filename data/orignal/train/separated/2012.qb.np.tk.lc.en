you &apos;re guilty of bribing a foreign government to get your pipeline .
guilty as charged .
you think you &apos;re not replaceable ?
i &apos;ve been doing this before i met you ,
and i &apos;ll be doing it long after i &apos;ve forgotten all about you .
please don &apos;t do this .
your beloved associates are mine .
what you want is a long , drawn @-@ out trial
that puts our stock in the toilet .
i &apos;m here to tell you
he &apos;s recusing himself from the case .
so he appointed a special prosecutor .
i win , you back me for managing partner .
you want to take down jessica .
yes , i do .
holy shit .
was that a good &quot; holy shit &quot; or a bad &quot; holy shit &quot; ?
harvey , you just told me that you &apos;re planning a coup .
give me a second to figure that out .
not a coup . it &apos;s a move .
and when you &apos;re done with your lecture--
no . no lecture .
i just have one question .
do i get my own office ?
harvey , if you want to be managing partner
and darby agreed to back you ,
then i &apos;ll follow you to the ends of the earth .
but before we start , i want to make sure
you &apos;re ready to do this to jessica .
i am .
then let &apos;s go beat the shit out of cameron dennis .
i know you don &apos;t want to see me .
and yet--
i just wanted to let you know that i got
a copy of the letter that jessica blackmailed me with ,
and i made it clear to her that i would take it
to the d.a. if she ever threatened me ,
so what i did will never happen again .
never should have happened in the first place .
close the door on your way out .
donna and i have work to do .
律师
there &apos;s a harsh reality i need to inform you of ,
and it &apos;s a bitter pill to swallow .
but the truth is , a mistake was made .
a fatal mistake .
and as much as i hate to admit it ,
our time together is done .
no more work ,
no more laughter .
remember ?
no more mentorship
and , um , no more anything .
see , i reached too high , and i fell .
and my punishment is the end of my tenure
as head of the associates .
so i would like to leave you
with the immortal sentiment
of robin williams .
there have been other associates before you .
they believed they were destined for great things ,
just like you .
if you just listen ,
you can hear &apos; em whisper their legacy to you .
carpe diem .
seize the day , people .
make your legal lives extraordinary .
oh , captain , my captain .
there was a time i would &apos;ve been relieved
to see that-- no more louis .
it &apos;s just wrong .
this whole merger is wrong .
how &apos;d it go with harvey ?
it didn &apos;t .
did you tell him about jessica ?
yeah . he didn &apos;t care .
what ?
i just wish i could give you a hug right now ,
but i can &apos;t because we still want to keep us quiet .
well , come on . you can give me a hug .
something could &apos;ve happened .
something bad , like a ...
my dog could &apos;ve died .
oh , you have a dog now ?
i was really close to this dog .
well , the best way to get over the death of a dog
is to get a new one .
no ?
no .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m just too upset .
i &apos;m-- i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m ready
for a new fake dog right now .
okay .
just leave me like this .
how did it go ?
i don &apos;t know . awful .
probably the hardest thing i ever had to do .
louis , we just merged ,
and i wish i could undo you losing the associates ,
but i can &apos;t .
what i can do
is take what you &apos;ve been giving
to so many for so long
and have you channel it into one .
you mean ...
i want you to mentor your own associate .
finally .
the d &apos;artagnan to my athos , porthos , and aramis .
all for one and one for all .
en garde !
sorry .
jessica , wait .
i can have anyone ?
louis , take your pick of the litter .
good morning , ms. paulsen .
spit it out .
is that any way to start the day ?
you want something .
i need the 411 on the breakup .
are we in high school ?
life is high school .
and i need to know if the prom king
and his boy wonder are still an item .
what high school did you go to ?
donna , it &apos;s a simple question .
did mike and harvey break up break up ,
or did they take a time @-@ out and , like , say to each other ,
&quot; hey , let &apos;s see other people
and make sure that we &apos;re sure . &quot;
i see what &apos;s going on here .
jessica feels sorry for you ,
so she &apos;s given you your pick of the liter .
and now you &apos;re sniffing around here ,
trying to put the moves on mike behind harvey &apos;s back .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no . i would never do that .
no , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here to ask permission .
so ask him .
well , i think it might go better
coming from a different source .
you want me to ask him .
yeah .
would you please ?
no .
why ?
because it would be so much more fun
for me to listen to you ask him .
well , let me get this straight .
you want my permission to take mike
and force him to be your associate .
no , i would never force him to do anything .
it has to be consensual .
not like sally jones and senior prom .
wait a second . did you just admit to a crime ?
no , a crime was committed upon me .
okay , i don &apos;t want to , but i have to .
what crime ?
my mom felt bad for sally , so she forced me to take her .
well , what was so bad about her ?
she had four nipples .
okay , if that date was so bad ,
i mean , how did you find that out ?
okay , you know what , harvey ,
do i have your blessing or not ?
knock yourself out , louis .
see , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
you &apos;re just saying that because you think he &apos;s gonna say no .
oh , i know he &apos;ll say no .
well , i know you &apos;re wrong .
so you better think about this very carefully ,
because once permission is given ,
you cannot go back .
speak now , or forever hold your peace .
fine . he &apos;s yours .
i &apos;m sure you two will be very happy together .
good , &apos; cause when i &apos;m done with him ,
mike ross will be begging to be my associate .
well , well , a surprise .
jessica .
last time we saw each other ,
you were blackmailing me out of my job .
here to do it again ?
because you gave me what you had on me .
i just want to make one thing clear .
what i did to you , i did to you .
don &apos;t take it out on harvey .
oh , that &apos;s sweet .
like a mother protecting her cub .
take me on anytime you want ,
but don &apos;t punish harvey &apos;s client for what i did .
you did ?
you just happened on evidence from his time
at the d.a. &apos; s office ?
ah . the redhead .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because he may not have been the one to betray me ,
but he didn &apos;t stop it .
so after you threw him under the bus and i saved him ,
he should have thrown himself back under the bus ?
you just don &apos;t get it .
yes , i do .
what you &apos;re really pissed at
is that he chose me over you .
not you . what you are .
i put bad guys away .
you try to figure out
how to let them do whatever they want .
so don &apos;t come in here telling me
that i &apos;m taking something out on harvey &apos;s client ,
because i &apos;ll tell you something--
she did this .
you made me a mixed tape .
watch it , and then make me an offer ,
which i &apos;ll reject because ...
i got your client dead to rights .
well ?
this is the best steak i &apos;ve ever had in my life .
that is the best steak you will ever have
in your life .
as much as i appreciate for once
not having to eat my lunch from the hot dog stand ,
what are we doing here ?
can &apos;t a man just take out another man
in the middle of the day for some steak and some wine
and some cheesecake that &apos;s gonna knock your socks off ?
uh , some men could .
but i think you and i both know
that you are not one of those men .
true that .
want some more wine ?
don &apos;t mind if i do .
and you gotta try this cheesecake .
oh , no , louis , i &apos;m-- mm--
you know what i mean , right ? what do you think of that ?
hey , louis ! how was the steak ?
heaven .
how about you ?
best steak you ever had ?
uh , best steak i will ever have .
you taught him well .
what are you guys , brothers ?
oh , i &apos;m just kidding .
louis here &apos;s got a lovely sister , esther ,
two wonderful parents .
who the hell are you ?
i am mike ross . louis and i work together .
i wanted him to know who he was working for .
and i would like you to know
who &apos;s working for you .
&apos;cause mike here ,
he &apos;s the best steak you &apos;ll ever have .
you want to know what you &apos;re working for ?
tina , gina , adrian .
they &apos;ve been here 50 years between them .
they are my family .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re working for .
i @-@ i understand .
i do not understand .
eminent domain .
shit .
final hearing &apos;s tuesday .
if we don &apos;t win , this place becomes a shopping center .
then this place becomes a shopping center ,
because nobody wins eminent domain cases .
but what if we did , mike ?
then he &apos;d get to keep his restaurant .
he would get to keep his dream ,
and i would get to keep my dream .
and what is that ?
to rewrite the law .
and the way to do that
is to win an un @-@ winnable case .
what do you need me to do ?
you went to see cameron ?
i was just coming to apologize .
for interfering on my case .
he &apos;s pissed at you .
he &apos;s going to take it out on ava .
i wanted to let him know the person
he should be pissed at is me .
well , it &apos;s not gonna stop him from taking it out on ava .
which is why i was coming to apologize .
are you also going to apologize
for sending the message that i need you
to help me fight my battles for me ?
i don &apos;t want to fight cameron for you .
i want to fight cameron with you .
when the evidence is stacked against you ,
you do what o.j. did-- you hire the dream team .
oh , that &apos;s our bar ? o.j. ?
did he walk or not ?
fine .
but i &apos;m johnnie cochran .
you know .
you know i know .
mike told me .
nobody had to tell me after you sent me
on that wild goose chase after american gigolo .
上集中瑞秋以此为饵引开唐娜
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you know , it &apos;s not that you violated the sanctity of our friendship .
it &apos;s that you violated the sanctity of richard gere--
something i would like to do ,
but not the way you did it .
look , i was just trying to get mike back with harvey .
i understand .
because i never want their thing to be our thing .
it &apos;s not .
and the way to keep it from becoming our thing
is to stop talking about them .
done .
so you and mike .
i know . it &apos;s a lot .
do you want to talk about it ?
of course i do .
okay , i think we should start
with the most important emotional question .
okay .
i &apos;m actually getting worried for you .
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
louis , you said 5 : 00 . it &apos;s only 4 : 30 .
i &apos;ve been here since we ate .
i &apos;ve been researching every eminent domain case
ever tried , starting with 1905 .
clark v. nash .
i thought you wanted me to be doing the research ?
i did .
but if i don &apos;t do it too , how can i help you ?
you &apos;re helping me ?
yeah . i help you help me .
that &apos;s how it works .
help me help you .
what ?
help me help-- it &apos;s jerry maguire .
jerry mc @-@ what ?
you--
okay , if you &apos;ve gone over every case file ,
then you know that the reason nobody wins
is because there is no chink in the armor .
well , then we make a chink of our own .
if i &apos;m on a jury ,
i &apos;m looking at a bribe , plain as day .
because that &apos;s exactly what it is .
i don &apos;t care what it looks like .
there &apos;s no audio .
it &apos;s our story versus theirs .
it &apos;s a shady deal and a case full of cash .
their story is going to be more compelling .
cameron &apos;s not going to risk trial without more .
do you think he has audio ?
what would it say ?
it would have this gentleman , colonel mariga ,
asking if we had the money
and my number two , nick howell , showing it to him .
then he would thank us for paying a pollution remediation fee .
that sounds environmentally sound .
except we &apos;d already remediated everything that needed to be remediated .
which is how you knew it was a bribe .
yes .
the question is ,
did you ever use that word in that room ?
i may be brazen , mr. specter ,
but i am not a fool .
then the audio won &apos;t help them anyway .
the colonel ?
no , they &apos;re still in power . he &apos;s not getting indicted .
what ?
cameron &apos;s got your protege .
no .
i &apos;ve been grooming nick for ten years .
i &apos;ve taught him everything he knows .
like how to bribe a foreign government ?
that is not the same . he would never turn on me .
you &apos;d be surprised what people you trust would do
when someone puts them in a position
where they think they don &apos;t have a choice .
harvey &apos;s right .
once someone puts another person down the path of bending the law ,
people tend to turn on each other .
you don &apos;t know him .
when &apos;s the last time you spoke to him ?
a few days ago .
call him . he won &apos;t take your call .
you &apos;re wrong .
he always takes my calls .
hi , it &apos;s nick . leave a message .
let me tell you what that message really said .
&quot; hi , ava . it &apos;s nick .
i &apos;m not here right now because i &apos;m cutting a deal to sell you out . &quot;
how &apos;s it going with louis ?
you know , it &apos;s actually not bad .
but the truth is , i would rather be--
no .
what ? come on .
it &apos;s the middle of the night .
louis could be back at any minute .
i can be fast .
i know .
that was a one @-@ time thing .
mm , mm , mm . enough , enough .
but i-- okay .
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
the last person we want catching us is louis .
did it ever occur to you that &apos;s he &apos;s trying to recruit you ?
can we just for once assume
that louis doesn &apos;t have an ulterior motive ?
i got us some refreshments .
i will leave you two to your work .
so ?
yeah .
louis , it &apos;s the middle of the night .
where did you get all this ?
i &apos;m the new quartermaster , remember ?
okay .
here , check this out .
whoa , no one &apos;s thought to come at it this way .
mike , this is outstanding .
i actually got the idea from a movie .
moneyball .
i thought you hated sports .
moneyball isn &apos;t about sports .
it &apos;s about math .
exactly .
one problem . it &apos;s outside the scope .
what if it weren &apos;t ?
what if i could fly ?
well , i can &apos;t help you with that .
but if we want to get it in the scope ,
we just have to get the other side to put it there for us .
morning .
nice mustang , harvey .
i see you &apos;re still trying to be steve mcqueen .
not trying .
being .
this is the scene where he corners the asshole .
speaking of movies , did you enjoy the one that i sent over ?
it &apos;s not often we get the whole crime on film .
all you have is a silent film with no proof of anything .
and by the way , i &apos;m going to have you sanctioned
for withholding evidence .
i gave you that video in a timely manner .
you gave us that video ,
so we &apos;d take our eyes off nick .
nick who ?
the nick you have stashed in a hotel room somewhere .
oh , that nick .
now that you mention it ,
i probably should put him on my witness list .
i &apos;m a little out of practice .
there you go .
now ... why don &apos;t you get
that piece of shit out of my driveway , okay ?
the first time i ever had steak ,
it was at peter &apos;s .
i mean , i &apos;d had steak before ...
but i never had steak before .
but that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here today .
you see , halfway through the meal ,
peter came over to my table ,
and he asked how i &apos;d liked it .
he wanted to know because he cared .
he cared about me .
i don &apos;t make friends very easily ,
but the second i set foot in peter &apos;s steakhouse ,
i had made a friend for life .
and that is how peter treats every single person
who walks through his door .
so i don &apos;t care what they say .
your honor , this is not a public benefit .
your honor , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m touched .
he makes me want to run right over there
and get a steak .
but as for the supreme court decision in kelo ,
法院允许政府为了经济发展的需要征用私有财产
public benefit is determined on a quantitative ,
not qualitative basis .
well , i &apos;m glad you brought up kelo ,
because we happen to have some quantitative evidence right here .
kelo was decided in 2005 .
eight years later and still ,
nothing has been built on this land .
no jobs created ,
no taxes collected , no money made .
zero quantitative benefit .
just because they say it will be better
doesn &apos;t mean it actually will be .
even if it were true , we have every right to do it .
the state determines benefit , not the court ,
and until such time as the law is changed ,
you have no authority to affect the state &apos;s determination .
uh , your honor , you can establish authority today .
there &apos;s no basis for that .
you have no choice but to uphold
the established practice of eminent domain .
i &apos;m afraid opposing counsel is right .
demolition begins next week .
i just remembered something about moneyball .
the a &apos;s never actually won the world series .
i &apos;m sorry , louis .
now is not the time to be sorry .
what is it the time for ?
get in .
nah , i think i &apos;m good .
mike , there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
it &apos;s just good , clean mud .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
is this about the fact that i &apos;m in the nude ?
please don &apos;t harp on that .
yeah , i &apos;m just saying , i know
how the younger generation gets hung up on that stuff .
but you don &apos;t have to worry
because you have your own self @-@ contained unit .
okay , if i get in , will you stop saying words ?
you know , if you go in with boxers ,
you &apos;re not gonna have them later .
you &apos;re gonna have to go smokeless .
that disloyal piece of filth .
believe me , i know how you feel .
do you ?
because i &apos;ve heard you prefer to work alone .
well , i don &apos;t .
i may have been above him when we started ,
but for the last two years ,
we worked together side by side .
i &apos;m not a sentimental person , but it meant something to me ,
and i thought it meant something to him .
he deserves to be shot .
he does .
but i suggest we promote him instead .
you want to give him a new title to keep him from testifying ?
i believe it will require a substantial raise as well .
you know that &apos;s not what i meant .
you &apos;re suggesting bribing a man
to get you out of your bribery charge .
in for a penny , in for a pound .
mother always said .
this is what cameron wanted .
he didn &apos;t give us that video so we wouldn &apos;t find nick .
he gave us nick , so you &apos;d try to bribe him .
well , how can you know that ?
because cameron knows people are who they are .
you bribed once , you &apos;ll bribe again .
well , then what are you suggesting i do ?
because i &apos;m going to make a run at him .
no , i &apos;m gonna make a run at him .
louis .
yeah ?
this is the best damn mud i &apos;ve ever had .
hey , i--
i know why you picked me for this case .
i wouldn &apos;t have picked you if you didn &apos;t .
if you wanted me to be your associate ,
why didn &apos;t you just ask ?
because you would &apos;ve said no .
louis , come on .
no , mike .
i know what people think of me ,
and i know what you think of me .
i knew you &apos;d remember
all the bad things about working with me .
i just wanted to remind you of some of the good ones .
i remember all the good ones ,
but i also remember after those things ,
you going back to being
the same louis i met the first day of work .
the louis who fired someone right in front of my face
for the sole purpose of teaching me to be afraid .
you &apos;re right .
i remember you once said that my actions matter
and that it &apos;s not water under the bridge .
you &apos;ve changed me .
you make me want to be a better man .
wait , are you saying i complete you ?
you have seen jerry maguire .
no , i &apos;m quoting my cinema hero ,
the character of melvin udall ,
expertly portrayed by jack nicholson as good as it gets .
oh . never saw it .
oh , well , then you &apos;re lucky .
why is that ?
because you can still see it for the first time .
the first time .
that &apos;s it , the first time .
what ?
the judge .
you were making your argument about the first time .
he wanted to rule in our favor , but he couldn &apos;t .
i know , that &apos;s why we need him to rewrite the law .
no , we don &apos;t , because there &apos;s already
a provision in the law that works for us .
it &apos;s in section--
no , no , no , no .
first of all , i cannot mix work with mudding , okay ?
let &apos;s hit the showers .
i can &apos;t wait to stick it to opposing counsel .
do you need me to give you a hand out of there ?
i know who you are .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
no , nick . you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i &apos;d like you to go .
no . you wouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;d like to give me five minutes
to see if i can get you out of the box you &apos;re in
before you sell your soul .
i didn &apos;t want to do this .
you wouldn &apos;t let me in if you did .
i had no choice .
ava &apos;s in trouble whether i testify or not .
that &apos;s what cameron wants you to believe .
you haven &apos;t seen the video ?
i saw a business transaction .
you don &apos;t believe that .
i can sell that .
you just got to keep your head and shut your mouth .
just do what you &apos;re here to do ,
threaten me , or offer me a deal .
i &apos;ve considered both .
cameron said you would .
cameron &apos;s wrong .
i &apos;m not going to do either
because i think you care about ava .
i do .
then think about this .
whatever deal cameron offered you ,
it &apos;s based on a lie . he doesn &apos;t have anything .
he &apos;s just trying to use your fear
to pit you against ava .
look , i &apos;ve seen it happen before ,
and the one thing i can tell you is
you go through with it , you &apos;ll regret it
for the rest of your life .
because she &apos;ll never forgive me .
because you &apos;ll never forgive yourself .
okay , what is so important that
we need to have an emergency hearing ?
your honor , we need to be heard
before demolition starts .
what &apos;s he going to do now ,
tell us about his first demolition ?
it was riveting , but this has nothing to do that .
your honor , based on the new zoning
put through for their project ,
we &apos;re simply asking for a revised valuation
of the property that they &apos;re taking .
$ 100 million ?
that valuation has no basis .
it has a mathematical basis .
specifically , the present value of future cash flow ,
as shown right there .
bullshit . you &apos;ve heard of voodoo economics .
里根总统实行的 &quot; 供给面经济学 &quot; 的批评说法
this is voodoo math .
they &apos;re making crazy assumptions to inflate their value .
just like kelo , but that
really didn &apos;t seem to bother you when it was in your favor .
your honor , this is ludicrous .
they &apos;re only picking that number
because they know it makes our project
too expensive to be feasible .
well , in the words of opposing counsel ,
even if that were true , we have every right to do it .
hi , donna . i love your dress .
and i love when you compliment me
before you ask for something .
you &apos;re so insightful .
look , i know we said
harvey and mike &apos;s problem isn &apos;t our problem ,
but louis is stealing mike .
it &apos;s not stealing when someone &apos;s available for the taking .
you knew ?
when do i not know ?
louis asked for harvey &apos;s blessing with mike ,
and he gave it .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because we agreed that their problem isn &apos;t our problem .
i know . but harvey doesn &apos;t really want this ,
and you know that because--
because he can &apos;t .
look , he needs you to do your donna thing
and help him get over it .
harvey listens to me because i tell him what i believe .
what do you believe ?
that mike betrayed harvey .
mike was blackmailed .
and then he betrayed harvey .
donna , how can you--
how can i what ?
i just spent the last year hiding your boyfriend &apos;s double life .
i &apos;d say i &apos;m a pretty understanding person .
but what i don &apos;t understand is
when someone takes loyalty like that ,
and they throw it in the garbage .
would you like me to say that to harvey ?
sorry i asked . won &apos;t happen again .
yeah , that was awesome .
that was a great job , mike .
thanks , louis .
rachel .
looks like you won .
the judge is ruling tomorrow .
then what were you just celebrating ?
well , we were dead in the water ,
and now we have a fighting chance .
i &apos;m glad .
is something wrong ?
oh , i just got into a fight with donna .
about what ?
i went to tell her about you and louis ,
and she just--
you went to donna about me and louis ?
i thought she could help .
you what ?
i thought if she knew ,
she &apos;d go to harvey ,
and they &apos;d just put an end to it .
someone butting in and telling him what to do
is only going to push him further away .
i didn &apos;t tell him what to do .
i went to donna .
if donna tells him ,
all it says is that i &apos;m too weak
to fight my own battles .
god , if it &apos;s coming from you ,
that makes it so much worse .
why ?
what ?
harvey forbid me to tell you anything .
you and harvey talked about me ?
after we went out , i went to him ,
i said i wanted to tell you--
and he said i wasn &apos;t trustworthy .
it &apos;s not that .
he didn &apos;t want you to go out with me .
no , it &apos;s not that either .
he didn &apos;t have a problem with us going out , he--
oh , so it &apos;s okay if you screwed me
so long as you lied .
rachel .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s why you cut things off with me .
i didn &apos;t want to lie to you .
i can &apos;t believe him .
rachel , he didn &apos;t just risk everything
he had for me once .
when jessica found out , he put everything
he had on the line for me again .
i hope you know as you stand here defending him ,
he has no intention of ever forgiving you .
because i found out when louis asked harvey for his blessing ,
he said , &quot; take him . he &apos;s all yours . &quot;
so instead of getting mad at me
for trying to get harvey to forgive you ,
maybe you should get pissed at harvey
and think about moving on .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i said i was sorry ,
i gave back the office ,
i helped you with your case , i even blackmailed jessica .
harvey , i get that you are pissed off at me ,
but eventually ,
you are going to have to forgive me .
forgive you for what , making me hire katrina ?
getting high on the job your first week ?
betraying me with jessica ?
or for telling rachel about your secret ?
you cut me loose .
okay ? you fired me .
i was at my lowest point .
she was there for me .
she &apos;s still there for me .
congratulations .
i hope you two are happy together .
so you &apos;re gonna punish me by giving me to louis ?
well , let me tell you something .
it failed .
i actually like working for louis .
he makes me feel like i &apos;m working with him ,
not for him .
well , i &apos;m glad to hear that .
because i didn &apos;t give you to louis as punishment .
i gave you to louis because you and i are done .
harvey , i regret what i did .
but i &apos;m telling you right now ,
you &apos;re gonna regret this .
maybe you didn &apos;t hear me .
i said you and i ...
we &apos;re done .
whatever it is , i &apos;m not really in the mood right now .
harvey , i know how cameron works .
he &apos;s setting something up .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
he &apos;s setting ava up to bribe nick .
isn &apos;t that what you just did ?
no .
i went to him and told him
he &apos;d regret being disloyal to her .
something i know a little bit about .
harvey , do you know what started it
between the hatfields and the mccoys ?
i didn &apos;t catch the miniseries , but i heard costner killed it .
doesn &apos;t matter .
because whoever they say started it ,
i guarantee you ,
the other side says , &quot; bullshit . &quot;
you went to darby for this merger behind my back .
and then you picked a fight with him behind my back .
and then you blackmailed mike behind mine .
and i was only able to do that
because you brought a fraud into my firm in the first place .
so you do think it &apos;s my fault ?
what i think is i regret where we are ,
and i &apos;ve been trying to get us back to where we were .
and what would the evidence of that be ?
what evidence would you like ?
why don &apos;t you tell me the truth
about why the hell i &apos;m on this case ?
all right , harvey .
i lied to you .
when i told you i fought to get you on this case ,
i didn &apos;t .
darby made that call .
and i used it as an opportunity to reach out to you .
&quot; used . &quot;
to reach out to you .
which i am now here doing
without using anything .
so do you want to let it go or not ?
i want to know one thing .
if you had it to do over ,
would you do it again ?
deposition &apos;s on the books with cameron tomorrow .
you want me there or not ?
harvey , i &apos;d introduce you to nick .
but i understand you two already met
when you witness @-@ tampered .
nick works for hessington oil .
we &apos;re their lawyers .
therefore , i didn &apos;t witness @-@ tamper .
and if you say it again ,
i &apos;m gonna slap you with a slander suit .
well , let me slap you with something .
tony gianopolous got a hold of that video somehow ,
and he gave it to your shareholders .
they &apos;re filing some sort of lawsuit .
i think he &apos;s trying to take over the company .
you son of a bitch . you leaked it .
i deny that .
and if your client says that again ,
i will slap her with a slander suit
to go alongside her bribery charges .
and by the way ,
nick wasn &apos;t swayed
by your attempt to tug at his heartstrings .
emotional pleas ?
what did you do to him , jessica ?
this is not the kid i mentored .
hold on a sec .
you were never my mentor . jessica was .
you &apos;re just a fast @-@ talking car salesman
that hides behind the line , &quot; i do good . &quot;
now get out of my face while i confer with my client .
you told me you knew this man .
i thought that was an advantage .
instead , you &apos;ve goaded him into orchestrating
an attempt to take over my company .
you know how sometimes the doctor says
you &apos;re gonna feel worse before you feel better ?
what are you saying ?
what he &apos;s saying is
let us know how you feel in half an hour .
do you have a second ?
i want to talk to you about how we left things .
i don &apos;t know , did you run it by harvey first ?
what ?
i understand
that he has final say onwho his employees fraternize with .
look .
harvey wasn &apos;t just trying to protect himself ,
mike , jessica , and me .
he was also trying to protect you .
right , my protection &apos;s at the top of harvey &apos;s agenda .
he barely knows who i am .
rachel .
and if he did know me ,
he would know that i would never tell anyone .
okay , look .
you want to be mad at harvey , fine .
but you might as well be mad at me ,
because i told mike the same thing .
what ?
i dragged mike into harvey &apos;s office ,
and i told him that harvey was right .
that mike should lie to me ?
no .
i told him that he should get over you .
was that before or after
i came to you and told you that i kissed him
and that i called him and told him how i felt ?
it was after .
you told him not to be with me ,
and then you let me think that he didn &apos;t care about me .
no , i told him what i thought ,
and then i tried
to help you move on because their truth
wasn &apos;t mine to tell you .
i thought you were my friend .
i am .
you cared more about protecting harvey
than protecting me .
yes , rachel ! that &apos;s my job .
i get that everyone &apos;s jobs are important .
this wasn &apos;t about a job for me .
it was about having a life .
but i guess you wouldn &apos;t understand that .
rachel ...
i &apos;m going to walk away before you and i can &apos;t go back .
it &apos;s the second largest oil deposit
found in the last decade .
we had the contract for it , but to get it out of the e.i.r. ,
we needed the pipeline .
what were you told ?
and by whom ?
we were told by colonel mariga
we could build the pipeline if we paid
a pollution remediation fee .
but ?
we &apos;d already remediated everything
that needed to be remediated .
so what was the fee for ?
it was a bribe .
and ava hessington paid this fee
with the full knowledge that it was a bribe ?
yes , she did .
on this screen here , nick ,
are you sliding a briefcase full of cash
across the table to colonel mariga ?
yes .
and you were aware it was a bribe ?
yes , but--
how was ms. hessington as a boss ?
she taught me a great deal .
did she trust you ?
i believe so .
rely on you ?
yes .
did she look over your shoulder on everything you did ?
no .
was she aware of everything you did ?
she was aware of this .
yet all we have is your word on that .
so let me get this straight .
she groomed you , promoted you ,
gave you autonomy , then you engineered a bribe .
and when you got caught ,
you cut a deal
to lay that bribe on your mentor .
is that correct ?
she knew .
yes . you claimed that before .
if ava hessington were convicted of this crime ,
who would be considered next in line ?
that &apos;s speculative .
is it at all possible it would be you ?
yes .
wow , sounds like you have a lot to lose
and even more to gain .
we &apos;re not in court .
your testimony doesn &apos;t help you here .
no , but we wanted to give you a taste
of what it would be like in court
when nick still won &apos;t be able to look her in the eye
when he stabs her in the back .
we won .
we did ?
we did .
i just want to say one thing .
you know , if harvey had the power
to become mariano rivera , he would ,
because harvey doesn &apos;t love the law .
it &apos;s just his vehicle for forcing
his will on his opponents , for winning .
but you see , mike , that &apos;s not how i feel about the law .
i love the law .
and i &apos;d never trade it for anything .
i love it too . i also like winning .
i know .
you know what i think ?
i think you &apos;re half harvey and you &apos;re half me .
you &apos;ve had your time with him .
now have your time with me .
harv ...
you &apos;re here for an interview ?
they let you go already ?
you made your point .
if we go to trial , you eviscerate nick .
but we still have that video ,
she &apos;s on it , and he says she knew .
and you know what ? the truth is i believe him .
and i &apos;ll make them believe him .
then why are you here ?
nice job , harvey . you got me .
they want you to cut a deal .
against my recommendation .
i guess they know what you don &apos;t .
you can &apos;t beat me .
here are our terms .
no , here are my terms .
our original offer stands .
hessington oil pleads no contest .
被告方无法推翻指控 但控方也无有力证据证明被告有罪
we pay a $ 50 @-@ million fine .
and all criminal charges against ava are dropped .
they were going to go for that ,
but i convinced them to make one change .
nonnegotiable .
ava hessington doesn &apos;t plead no contest .
she pleads guilty .
and you get to call it a win .
well , the record is going to say guilty .
it is a win .
i can beat you ,
and i did .
and it &apos;s going to eat you up .
dennis , one .
specter , zero .
take it or leave it .
this deal is bullshit .
harvey .
cameron can say what he wants .
darby asked you to take this case .
no way he doesn &apos;t consider this a win .
i don &apos;t consider it a win .
do you really want to gamble five years of her life ,
so you can prove you &apos;re better than cameron ?
you know as well as i do , he &apos;s only offering this
&apos;cause he knows he &apos;s got a loser .
it &apos;s the exact same deal we offered
with one technical change .
do you know how they enter a technical knockout
in the record books ?
as a knockout .
i would .
what ?
you asked me before if i &apos;d do it again .
i would .
you put me in that position again ,
and i &apos;ll do whatever i have to do to win .
because we win .
are you saying screw this deal , let &apos;s kick his ass ?
no .
i &apos;m saying take the deal .
we already did .
sorry .
me too .
you were just trying to help me .
yeah , but i shouldn &apos;t have said something
i knew would hurt you just to end an argument .
i don &apos;t want to keep secrets from you .
you don &apos;t have to .
so louis asked me .
and what did you say ?
i told him i needed some time to think about it ,
and then i came straight here .
so you &apos;re really just apologizing
because you need my advice .
well , i also want sex .
you can have one or the other .
i really don &apos;t need any advice .
it &apos;s a good deal , ava .
don &apos;t second @-@ guess yourself .
i &apos;m not in the habit of second @-@ guessing myself .
no , i just realized when i get back to london ,
my right hand is going to be gone .
your right hand sold you out .
you made it seem like he did it for his own personal gain .
but he did it for his own survival .
he still did it .
but that doesn &apos;t mean
i &apos;m not going to miss him .
good @-@ bye , harvey .
good @-@ bye , ava .
do you want me to send a copy to darby ?
i do .
i thought maybe working with jessica
would change your mind about taking over the firm .
it didn &apos;t .
why not ?
because if she had it to do all over again ,
she would .
harvey , if this whole thing
is really jessica &apos;s fault ,
maybe it &apos;s time we considered forgiving mike .
if she &apos;s not vacuuming properly , then just fire her .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;ll get someone--
mom , i gotta go . bye .
you make me want to be a better man .
you watched it ?
loved it .
well , you had me at hello .
you watched jerry maguire ?
jerry , did you know the human head weighs 8 pounds ?
these are the abc &apos;s of me , baby .
show me the money !
you know , normally , i wouldn &apos;t want to jinx anything ,
but i got us something .
okay .
the perfect way to consummate our relationship .
so just wait right here . it &apos;s in the kitchen .
sure .
i can &apos;t let you do this .
let me ?
don &apos;t do this .
i already said yes .
i can &apos;t go back on my word .
you &apos;re not going back on your word .
you &apos;re going back where you belong .
i am .
i am sorry .
i know .
look , why don &apos;t you take tonight off
and go out with your girlfriend ?
thanks , harvey .
no , we &apos;re going up top .
oh , really ?
yeah .
but if you come in late tomorrow , you &apos;re fired .
we &apos;ll see .
