伊芙·帕克医生
Rod!
Eve?
No!
Jane, stop playing with the doughnuts and help.
枪伤及爆炸伤研讨会
I'm not playing.
This is playing.
I still don't get why you agreed to host this thing...
and why they don't bring their own clothes.
Well, the convention center doubled their rate
after last year's... issue.
What issue?
She left a severed head in the hotel fridge.
Dominick, delivering the bread again.
Ugh, I can't find a new delivery guy.
Oh. I don't mind.
It's nice to get out from behind the counter.
Jane, you remember Dominick.
Yes! How are you?
Good. It's nice to see you, Jane.
Good to see you.
You, um, you used to love fresh ciabatta rolls.
Oh, yeah! Yeah! Bianchi's Bakery!
Oh, I haven't been there in years.
Maura, you got to try one of these.
White flour only uses the endosperm.
It's awful to eat with you.
Dominick, whenever you get backed up,
I'm more than willing to swing by
and pick up my order...
in my new car.
What? Since when?
Since I became
Can'o Espress'o's salesperson of the month.
A crappy canned coffee gave you a car?
A Camry.
She's beautiful. Wait till you see her.
Is he with the band?
Hello, Dr. Pike. It's nice to see you.
Detective Rizzoli, you look stunning.
Stunning? Thank you.
Oh, hello, Dr. Isles.
Hello, Dr. Pike.
You brought quite a few things.
Well, when you're a cutting-edge forensic scientist,
you have an obligation to share that knowledge
with your less-skilled colleagues.
The colleagues that can't tell the difference
between a .38- and a .45-caliber bullet?
Oh, look! More cutting-edge forensic scientists.
Hello. I am delighted to welcome you all
to the annual Bullet and Blast Injuries Symposium.
Well, this is real nice of you, Dr. Isles.
Of course. Nice to see you again.
I look forward to your PowerPoint presentation
on the pathophysiology of blast injuries.
Hey, girl! Um...
Me? He called me a girl?
Can I help you?
Yeah, take this. Goes in the freezer.
When I need, you bring.
Oh, not again!
What?
I-I don't know.
I guess my phone number is close to some guy's wife's number.
I keep getting all these weird texts,
Like, "Hon, pick up my dry cleaning.
"Hon, I think we're out of milk."
Dr. Isles, I specifically requested
a special meal --
Steel-cut oats with dried-fruit topping.
This better be a murder. Mm.
It is! Come on.
Excuse me!
Have a doughnut. No endosperm.
Double homicide.
Looks like a .38.
Who are the victims?
Husband and wife shrinks. No sign of forced entry.
No surveillance cameras inside or outside the building.
That's bad.
What, you think we're looking for a patient?
Maybe. Frost is talking to the office manager.
W--
Dr. Eve Parker?
What the Dr. Eve?
Media's gonna have a field day with this.
Why? Who's she?
Someone who hated children.
Jane, that's not true.
Really? She wrote "No womb for Children."
She advocates childless marriages.
Ma used to listen to her radio program
when she was mad at us.
Well, I am only familiar with the work of her husband,
Dr. Rod Parker.
Yeah, did he hate kids, too?
He was an expert in delusional disorders.
Soot on the clothing.
Stippling on the skin.
Yeah, his was a close-contact through-and-through.
Hers was from maybe three feet away.
Look at the way the bodies are positioned.
She's on her way out to the bathroom,
which suggests our shooter was lying in wait.
Maybe the husband was talking to the shooter,
and she surprises them?
Maybe.
Or she comes out first,
He hears the gun go off, runs out.
What what we need to know is,
were they both targets or just one of them?
Office manager found the bodies when she came in at 7:00 a.m..
Did you get a patient list from her?
No. I got a search warrant going.
She gave me yesterday's patient sign-in sheet, though.
Okay, so, Dr. Eve's last patient was at 5:00,
Dr. Rod's at 6:00.
What, patients only sign in with their initials?
It's a privacy issue.
Well, thank you, doctor.
I had no idea grandly deluded
people wanted privacy.
Hey, Maura, you got your tweezers?
Mm-hmm. Look.
It's a piece of latex from the shooter's glove.
Latex has many uses --
balloons, pencil erasers, spandex.
Okay, I'm going to guess
that the shooter wasn't wearing spandex
or carrying balloons.
I hope it's enough to recover a partial print.
A single bullet penetrated the left ventricle.
That size hole says
it's in the 0.38-caliber family.
Oh, bullets have families in Texas,
do they?
It was obviously a .45.
Female victim also died from a .45.
I'm thinking
we got a different horse galloping here.
Oh, really? A Morab?
A mustang?
Well, you're saying the bullet that made that hole
is a draft horse,
and I'm saying it's more like a Shetland pony.
This is waste of time.
I'm sorry?
It's classic murder-suicide.
But both victims died instantly,
and the gun wasn't recovered.
It's so obvious. Kindergartner would know.
Husband shoots wife,
then shoots his chest,
just has enough time to toss the gun out in the window.
It's like chicken whose head cut off.
Dr. Popov, human beings don't move
once the cerebral cortex has been s--
I think you're wasting your breath.
This guy don't know his butt from a hole in the ground.
I'd like to take this opportunity
to unveil the most significant new development
in the forensic world.
The particle-vac!
Dr. Pike, please turn that thing off.
Capable of fully adjustable suction
up to 50 kilopascals.
Step aside, please.
Please turn that off!
We are here to advance each other's knowledge
of gunshot wounds!
Whoa! Now look what you've done!
I'm gonna have to bill you for that.
Crime lab is working on that piece of latex.
Maybe we'll get lucky, get a partial print.
Dr. Eve had a huge web presence.
She just released her newest book.
"No Need to Breed."
Here she is promoting the book.
You can choose not to be a mother.
You do not have to breed.
Judge Allen denied our request
for patient files and phone records.
He won't even allow us to get a list of names.
Now what are we gonna do?
We'll go see Allen in his chambers.
Okay.
Dr. Eve had a book signing at the Literate Mind Bookstore
a few hours before she was murdered.
That's interesting.
So is this.
Dr. Eve had a lot of haters.
Here's a blogger with a big following --
Valerie Miller.
"Waak" --
"Wives are about kids."
Looks like she's aiming a rifle at our victim.
"This fiend hates your child"?
This from a mother of nine?
She's sure plugged in to social media
for someone who homeschools all those kids.
Check out her timeline.
Translation, please?
Oh, she leads such a fascinating life,
she wants everyone to know what she's doing at all times.
Where was "Mrs. Waak" yesterday?
The Literate Mind Bookstore,
where Dr. Eve had the book signing.
Where was she last night?
Don't know. She stopped checking in.
Well, I don't think "Mrs. Waak"
was getting a signed copy of "No need to Breed."
Don't you feel a little funny driving us?
why would I feel funny?
It's the nicest car I ever had.
Come on.
Let's get these groceries inside,
and I'll take you for a spin.
Oh, I-I can't right now.
They just gave it to you?
I have to do a little promotion.
It's voice-activated.
Can'o Espress'o added the loudspeaker.
Can you hear me?
Uh, yeah, ma.
Come see!
It has voice-activated Bing search capabilities.
Cool!
Frankie, you look so handsome in your uniform.
Oh, my god. Ma, stop!
Why? Am I embarrassing you --
Oh, my god! Somebody hit my car!
My brand-new car!
What the...
Well, I didn't hit it very hard, did I?
Oh, yeah, good. It's just a little dent.
A little dent? It's a brand-new car!
Ma, take the headset off.
Uh, I-I...
Shoot! I'm sorry.
I'll get it fixed.
Oh, you bet you will!
Don't you look where you're driving?!
Can I just give you cash?
I mean, is, um, $30 enough?
Are you kidding me?!
Frankie, tell me she's kidding me.
Let -- let me help you with that.
Ma!
What?
Come on.
U-um, how pregnant are you?
Seven months.
All right, all right. Don't cry.
We-- we'll call your husband.
Fiance--ex.
He dumped me.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Uh, here.
That's a lot of unpaid parking tickets.
Thank you.
That's why I'm here.
You're gonna boot my car
if I don't sign up for a payment plan.
There isn't really a payment plan.
Then what am I gonna do?
I lost my job. My roommate kicked me out.
I live in my car.
Lydia?
Yeah.
Oh, my god. You're sure?
Lydia-Lydia?
Dad's fiancee, Lydia?
Yeah, I saw her name on the parking notices --
Lydia Sparks.
And you're sure she's pregnant?
She's out to here.
Well, what do we do?!
How the hell should I know?
Well, should we call pop?
No, she says he dumped her.
Do we just not know him, or is he having some
deranged, late midlife crisis?
Janie, she's living out of her car.
What if that's our...?
Our brother or sister?
Oh, my god.
Uh, isn't there someone the children can stay with
while we talk?
Maybe an older sibling?
My children are very well-behaved.
Yeah.
Take a look at that.
You didn't like Dr. Eve much, did you?
Not even a little bit.
That's a pretty violent image.
I thought it made my point in a very visceral way.
So did shooting her. That made your point, too.
She's a despicable person.
I don't even want to share gender
by calling her a woman.
But I wouldn't stoop to killing her.
Hey! Finger out of your nose.
Do you have children, detective?
I do not.
It figures.
How does it figure?
Your waist.
Even you would have trouble
finding a flattering bathing suit after nine children.
Luckily, that's the only downside.
Is that why you shot Dr. Eve?
She didn't have stretch marks?
Oh, I'm very proud of my womb.
Oh, please don't show me your womb, Mrs. Miller.
Okay, where were you last night?
With my children
and 20 other mothers and their children
at my "Wives Are About Kids" meeting.
It's already on YouTube.
Would you like to see?
What makes you think that coming here in person
will make me change my mind, detectives?
We need that patient list, your honor.
There is nothing in your affidavit
to support your assumption,
that evidence of a crime will be discovered
if I allow you to
trample the rights of these patients.
All due respect, your honor --
both doctors were killed in their offices,
where they see their patients.
I'm not convinced.
Absent a stronger link
between your crime and these patients,
this is merely a fishing expedition.
Have a good day.
Judge Allen, this is important.
So's the law, detective.
We understand, your honor, but without those names --
If you ever want me to sign another warrant for you again,
I suggest you leave my chambers.
Where are all your little "Dr. Death" friends?
Enjoying a lecture on using silicone scalps
for terminal ballistics testing.
Mm, and you're missing it?
I know! 'cause I needed to get away from Dr. Pike.
I think Pike is on the take.
What?
He is using his position to privateer.
He's...attacking foreign ships during wartime?
I think he is taking kickbacks to hawk a forensic vacuum.
Maura, this is very serious.
It is?
No!
You haven't started the autopsy yet?
Pike is handing out hats and pens and travel mugs.
That is swag, detective.
I'll get our swag unit on it.
I need to know how to entrap him.
Okay!
Take it easy, Serpico.
Can we please solve our double homicide first?
Okay. Help me undress her.
Think you can be childless and have a fulfilling marriage?
No. With or without children, marriage is miserable.
Oh, not so.
Studies show that parents' happiness
has remained steady since 1972,
while non-parents' happiness has dropped.
Did I tell you I'm starting
a new organization called "S.A.W."?
That's a hostile acronym.
It stands for "Stuck At Work."
And I'm gonna be stuck here longer
if you don't get on it.
Okay.
It's a shell casing.
Where's the bullet that went through Dr. Rod?
Which means she was shot first,
then he was shot,
and the casing flew off into her sleeve.
Damn. No prints.
Wait.
Thanks.
Here.
Ugh, come on.
Not again with this weird husband guy.
Look. "Hon, don't forget
your Brazilian-wax appointment."
What -- I mean, how many times I got to tell this guy?
"I'm not your wife."
Oh, forgot to tell you, Frankie met Lydia today.
You're looking very, very guilty.
What are you not telling me?
I promised Tommy that I-I wouldn't say.
This looks very sharp.
Okay.
Okay.
But don't get mad.
What?!! Tommy slept with Lydia?!
I thought there wasn't any surveillance footage
of the victims' offices?
There isn't, but I found a private security camera
aimed at the building next to theirs.
Thought I'd see if maybe the killer walked by.
And how would you know if it was the killer?
Probably wouldn't.
But I did find this.
Smart, Frost.
What -- that's a City Car collecting footage of Boston.
Yeah. And it drove by the Parkers' building
at 5:56 p.m. yesterday.
What?
That's right before E.A. had an appointment with Dr. Rod.
Check this out.
She's headed right toward their building.
You think we have enough landmarks for facial recognition?
Won't know till we try.
Okay, she's pretty close.
Frost, the man is closer.
Oh, my god.
E.A. is Eugene Allen.
Judge Eugene Allen?
No wonder he wouldn't sign the warrants.
Yeah, because he's a patient.
Well, maybe he's a killer, too.
You want me to go with you?
No. No, this one belongs to me and Korsak.
Go get him.
You can't go into his chambers.
You can't go in there.
How dare you enter my chambers?
Why wasn't that door locked?
You're asking us?
Well, stop staring and shut the damn door.
I believe I told you not to return
until you had a stronger link
between your crime and Dr. Parker's patients.
That strong enough?
Did you kill him because he knew your secret?
Dr. Parker helped me.
I'm finally enjoying my life,
my work...
...because he encouraged me to be myself.
Behind closed doors, I am
Eugenia Allen.
Okay, Eugenia.
Sign these warrants for dr. Eve and dr. Rod's phone
and patient records.
You think you can blackmail me?
You think you can block a homicide investigation
to keep your personal life quiet?
Need a pen... uh, ma'am?
Thank you.
You have no idea how fun medical examiners' parties can be.
Talk about the case -- you'll fit right in.
Okay, so we got the patient lists.
It's like over 200 people.
Well, I'll take a look at the doctors' sessions notes.
Maybe I can eliminate the nonviolent patients.
Okay.
I mean, I think that Dr. Rod was the target.
I think Dr. Eve just picked the wrong time to go to the bathroom.
For you, Detective Rizzoli.
And since you're so good at stabbing people in the back...
I haven't reported you to the BBVB...
...yet.
Bullet and
Blast Violation Board.
Oh, my.
Jane!
Swag!
Attention, all swag units.
We have swag distribution in progress at the Dirty Robber.
This is very serious.
You could lose your Bullet and Blast Certification.
Ugh, not again!
What, another murder?
Another weird "Hon" message.
"Hon, waiting up for you."
Guess I should hurry home since I've had my brazilian.
I think you should tell your mother.
Where I wax is my business.
Lydia's baby might be her grandchild.
That baby might also be her ex-husband's bimbo's kid.
It's a good thing Tommy's fishing in the gulf.
I want to kill him.
Maybe that's why your father called off the engagement.
Because Lydia told him that
it might be Tommy's baby?
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. This can't be happening.
No, no, no, no, no.
Are you calling your father?
No, I'm gonna call Frankie.
Well, you can't tell him he might be an uncle over the phone.
But...
Oh, it's so nice to let my hair down
And enjoy a few long island iced teas.
How many have you had, Dr. Pike?
Not more than four.
Or is it five?
Well, perhaps that's enough.
You look stunning tonight, Dr. Isles.
Excuse me?
You're like a wildcat, aren't you?
Lapping up that liquid with your delicate pink tongue.
Please, stop.
I've been in love with you, okay?
Since the outdoor remains recovery course.
What?!
But I've been desperately afraid.
I lost everything
with my quest to develop the perfect forensic vacuum.
I invested everything in particle-vac, Maura.
Everything!
Okay. Stop. Stop.
What?
Lady says go away, Pike.
Buzz off, Popov.
You have as much chance with
woman as dead Dr. Parker.
No. The corpse has better chance.
Come on.
You want a piece of me?
Let's go.
Okay!
Here, let me help you.
Put up ducks.
These are "dukes," you moron.
What the hell?!
You call me moron, huh?
Pike declared his love for me.
What?!
You two are drunker than old Cooter Brown!
If you don't quit, I'm gonna whip you both so hard,
you won't be able to sit down for a week!
Thank you.
Sorry about that.
How's your, uh, case going?
You know, we don't have much forensic evidence.
I found a shell casing, but there's no prints.
I've been working on this new technique
I studied over in England
where sweat can sometimes corrode the brass casing.
What, so you think
you might be able to pull up a print?
I might. I can look at it for you tomorrow.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you very much.
All right, party's over. Let's go.
And you're telling Frankie.
I'm telling Frankie what?
What do you want to tell me?
Maura knows about Lydia.
That's what you wanted to tell me?
No.
Uh, okay.
It's about Tommy.
And he, uh --
I can't believe I can't say this.
He slept with Lydia.
He what?!
Maura!
Lydia?
Lydia?
Oh, my god, Maura, she needs your help.
Ohh, I don't feel so good.
This is Lydia Sparks.
She ran into my new car.
It's nice to meet you.
Can you tell the doctor what's wrong?
Yeah, she's pregnant with your first grandchild,
and she's drunk.
Oh, god. Come on.
Uh, uh, let's get her on the couch.
Okay, easy. I got it, ma. I got it. I got it.
Here we go. Here we go.
Okay. Easy, easy, easy, easy.
Okay.
I like couches.
Oh, you're really cute.
Ma.
Why would you bring a drunk, pregnant stranger
into Maura's house?
She came to the cafe? To apologize.
She felt bad.
So, you cheered her up with malt liquor?
We had dinner --
pasta, salad, some water.
I have to pee.
Again? Sh-she just went.
Lydia, are you thirsty?
I'm really thirsty.
Okay, Frankie, call an ambulance.
What? I need E.M.S...
Get her some orange juice.
Can't she just sleep it off in her car?
She has gestational diabetes.
Well, how bad is that?
Bad. She's slipping into a diabetic coma.
Will you hold my hand?
I'm really scared.
Okay.
It's gonna be okay, all right?
W-we're gonna take care of you.
It's like my mother has a homing device for trouble.
That's where Tommy gets it.
And we're throwing Lydia back in the pond
as soon as she gets out of the hospital.
Okay, but we're telling your mother who she is first.
I'm calling a family meeting.
What? It's not your family.
Well, it's my guest house.
And I only have a one-guest policy.
Okay, let's see if we can solve these murders first.
W-what?
Fine, I will get frankie and ma
to the dirty robber later today.
Good morning, Dr. Isles. You don't look very well-rested.
Guess you don't know your limit.
You don't remember?
Did you do something inappropriate?
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to prepare my presentation
on entrance and exit wounds.
You look stunning, detective.
Got my fingerprint-enhancement device.
You ready to try it?
Yeah, follow me, Dr. Rube Goldberg.
W-- I'm surprised you know who that is.
Oh, Maura,
25% of the population uses the internet.
Oh, not fair.
It doesn't count if you have to use google.
Can't get these in a forensic-supply catalog.
I put this together myself.
Never would have guessed.
So, the idea is the electrostatic charge
Allows the fingerprint powder to adhere to the brass casing.
Dr. John Bond at Leicester university developed it.
Classic electrostatic physics.
Shoot, I'm only an expert in common electrostatic physics.
That's unbelievable.
You got a partial print.
But there isn't enough ridge detail.
All I need is enough to compare it
to a list of patients.
No tented arch on this one.
This one, either.
How many patients did we get elimination prints from?
110 out of a total of 203.
Still got detectives out there trying to get the rest of them.
What the hell?
What is it?
Nothing.
What?
That's my phone number.
I --
Oh, my god!
You thought I was one of Dr. Parker's patients?
Nothing to be ashamed of.
I think you've hidden your
delusional disorders rather well, detective.
He called you three times last week.
I wonder why.
Wha-- no.
Hey, Dominick.
Uh, do you know how long you're gonna be?
This is my car right here.
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
It's okay.
C-can you just put that back on the rack?
Yes.
I'll move the truck.
Okay, thank you.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you grab a bag of ciabatta?
It's still warm.
It's on the last rack.
Okay. Thank you.
Sure.
This one?
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
I'll see you later.
Thank you--
I thought this would help ease tensions
in the family meeting.
What is it?
It's a talking stick.
They've been used for centuries by native Americans.
Hey. What's going on?
Where's Jane? She said we were having a family meeting.
She will be here any minute.
Sit down, Ma.
Take the talking stick.
I don't want the talking stick.
I want to know what this is about.
Well, uh, the talking stick has been used by many cultures
to designate who has the right to speak.
Which means the both of you
have something awful to tell me.
Is this about Tommy?
Give me that stick!
Because I have a feeling
that I'm going to have to use this stick
to knock some sense into your brother.
Her car is still here.
She's not answering her phone.
She left over an hour ago to meet you guys.
She did?
Oh, my god. Where is she?
Ma, come on. I'm gonna get you home.
I'm gonna try and track the gps on her phone,
Maybe get a location.
I'll be back. Find her, okay?
No signal on her phone. Can't track it.
Come on, think!
We're in the middle of this double-homicide case.
We don't know if it's related.
We know dr. Parker called Jane.
The dead guy? Why'd he call her?
Don't know.
Wait, wait. He -- he treated patients
with severe delusional disorders.
It'd be his ethical obligation
to call and to warn her
if he was treating someone who was a danger to her.
Put up the patient list, Frost.
And she was getting strange text messages.
Someone on this list knows something.
Oh, this could take all night.
We can't sit in here and go through lists!
Okay, what about the partial print
from the casing?
Korsak, what if we tried
to put the two partial prints together?
The one from the glove and the shell casing?
It's a long shot.
We need a few more points.
Rotate it to the left just a bit.
That might work. Run it.
That's the man who delivers bread to the cafe?
Dominick Bianchi --
Served eight years for stalking and maiming?
He was Parker's patient.
You got an address?
It's just the bakery.
Oh, hell.
Dominick has erotomanic delusional disorder.
Doesn't sound good.
It's a serious psychiatric disorder.
He believes a stranger,
most likely someone of a higher status,
is in love with him.
So, he thinks Jane's in love with him?
Hey, honey.
You missed your brazilian wax.
You were the one who was texting me?
Of course I did, honey.
You're my wife.
You took off my clothes?
Oh, yeah.
Do you like your new outfit?
Yes.
I love pink and ruffles and kitten heels.
Oh, good.
Oh, you look so beautiful.
Thank you.
Dominick, um, my wrists really hurt.
Is there any way that we could loosen these up
just a little bit?
Oh, you are sly.
No.
I'm gonna go out and get dinner for us.
Okay?
Give me something!
Checking his financials.
Okay, wait.
He bought a bunch of computer equipment recently.
Looks like he set up a webcam.
Maybe I can use an nmap
to run a port scan.
What, you think you can track him
through the bakery website?
Trying a telnet port.
Yes! I'm in.
He's sending this feed to his bakery
so he can watch her 24/7.
Oh, god, Jane.
That's her apartment!
No, stay here.
Sergeant Korsak,
I don't see Dominick.
Damn it! She's not here.
I couldn't see everything in your bedroom,
so I figured as long as I got it close...
Are the sheets okay?
Yeah, they're fine.
I don't remember having you over.
You know the building across the street?
If you go up the fire escape, you can see in your window.
When you leave the shades open.
Right.
You remember Hawaii?
Dominick, you know we never went to Hawaii.
Yes, we did!!
We had our honeymoon there.
We kayaked.
You surfed for the first time.
We went to that all-you-can-eat luau
with the pig, remember?
Yeah. Yeah, I remember now.
Liar.
Don't play me.
We didn't go to a luau.
Don't be like dr. Parker.
Did you tell dr. Parker about me?
Yeah.
I'm allowed to talk about my wife with my therapist.
Of course you are.
Damn right!!
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I deserved that. I'm sorry.
Oh, god.
What's she doing?
She has to try to make him stay in the fantasy.
What if he comes out of it?
We have to find her.
He's live-streaming, but he's smart.
He's hiding the I.P. address.
I can't find it.
Oh, my God.
Jane.
She sees it.
I-I love computers, Dominick, just like you.
I couldn't use one for a long time,
but I-I read a lot about them
at Bridgewater State.
Did you miss me?
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.
I wasn't there because of you.
I was there because of Emily.
What happened to Emily?
I will always love her.
He threw acid in her face -- blinded her.
Oh, my God.
I read about you in the paper.
I liked you when we were little
and you used to come into my parents' bakery.
You knew that you'd grow up to marry me, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Wouldn't it be fun if we put ourselves on TV
as Mr. and Mrs. Bianchi?
That's only for me.
No one else can watch you!
Where do you watch me?
Are you ready for dinner?
Frost.
If you're as good as I know you are,
you can see me right now.
Please tell me you can see me.
Frost, find me.
Please.
I'm praying that somebody can hear me.
Tell us where you are, Janie.
Come on.
Tell us where you are.
Please let somebody hear me.
Please.
Okay.
I hear, um, airplanes landing.
Must be close to the airport.
Less than -- than half a mile.
And -- and I-I hear a bell.
A warning bell.
The Chelsea Street Drawbridge.
Chelsea Street Drawbridge.
And -- and I smell fish.
The processing plant.
No, that's not enough.
There are hundreds of buildings in that area.
Frost, zoom in on the radiator and the window frame.
That's a cast-iron radiator, manufactured in 1890,
and a wooden window frame from the same era.
So, We're looking for something built in the late 1800s
that's still standing.
By the processing plant? They've all been torn down.
Maybe we're not even close.
Please, Frost, please come find me.
I got a building on Falcon Street --
built in 1891.
That's it. Let's go.
Come on! Just eat!
No, thank you.
I would rather feed myself.
Fine.
Starve, then!
I heard you talking.
I know you were talking to someon!
Dominick, I was talking to myself.
Don't hurt her.
I'm gonna have to make sure that you never look at anyone
or talk to anyone...
...ever again!
Police! Police! Police!
Don't move! Hands up, you son of a bitch!
Jane, you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Frankie, get me out of here, please.
I got you. It's okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Well, the worst part was the outfit.
Pink shoes.
Vomit.
I think Dominick killed Dr. Parker
because he was trying to warn you.
Poor guy.
And Dr. Eve got shot just 'cause she had to pee.
I mean, that's just wrong.
In Dominick's mind,
Dr. Parker was breaking up your marriage.
And what a marriage it would have been.
Did I show you my honeymoon pictures?
Oh, you went on a honeymoon?
My head did.
Apparently, we missed the luau.
I always wanted to go to a luau.
I'm thinking of freezing my eggs.
Okay, how much wine have you had?
Not much.
I just don't think marriage is for me.
But I'd like to preserve my option to have children.
Okay.
I'm gonna leave my eggs right where they are.
And we're gonna talk about something else.
Like what? You and Dr. Pike.
What a cute couple you'd make.
Mm, very funny.
Very, very funny.
