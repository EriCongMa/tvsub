I have your daughter.
You abducted Charlotte to get the Graysons to confess?
Put on the blindfold -- I'm letting you go.
If you don't have the guts to admit what you did to my real father,
I'll tell the police.
I have the power to take you out anytime I want!!
I was in league with the terrorists
who tried to bring me down, but I'm still here.
David Clarke was my patsy!
Turn on the tv in Grayson manor.
The transmission you just saw was live from inside the Grayson House.
What about Victoria?
Oh, I'm not finished yet.
It was probably Nolan.
He's the only person that's smart enough to pull this off.
We own the program now.
We don't need you to make it a success.
You're out.
Take Charlotte's hair and Carl's blood to the lab.
Hurry, please. A life depends on it.
I need answers.
Even if it threatens the last memory of your father?
Charlotte received letters
from somebody pretending to be David Clarke.
She and I tracked him to his house -- there was no one there,
but didn't your father have something like this?
This was my father's.
Sorry, dad. We were just playing treasure hunt.
Well, I'm glad that you and Jack took the time to find it.
It's an important ring.
Why?
My father gave it to me when I turned 18.
Said that I should respect the fact
that a name means a lot in this world.
That's why my initials are on it.
I wish I would have met him.
He was a lot like you.
Hated to be cooped up inside.
But instead of the beach, he loved the woods.
So much so that he even built a cabin.
We would go and spend our summers there.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna continue the family tradition when you turn 18.
I'm gonna give you something.
You still thinking about that ring?
You know, my father actually mentioned a cabin once.
You don't think it's the same place where Jack found this, do you?
There's nothing to be gained from indulging in that hope.
Especially when reality's pretty damn good right now.
I wish my father was here to see this.
Yeah, mine, too. They'd be proud of us, Amanda.
We've been to hell and back for them.
And for each other.
I never believed I'd find a partner in this,
nor did I ever think that we'd find peace.
Oh, ye of little faith.
Really? You're gonna make out
like this has all gone according to plan, are you?
No, but I'm gonna savor the hell out of our victories.
I love you, Aiden.
Since your father and I were to be married,
I consider you family now.
We'll help each other through this.
Of course, Victoria. Thank you.
I can't keep up this charade a moment longer.
Maybe I shouldn't have told you the truth about your father.
No, you did the right thing, Daniel.
If I'm to be strong, i need to know what could hurt me.
Especially about those closest to me.
I still can't believe he's gone.
Well, at least dad's gonna pay.
Promise to tell me what it's like
watching him squirm in the courthouse this afternoon.
Are you kidding? My presence would be misconstrued as support.
You're right.
He must be left alone...
and abandoned.
And we can finally put him and Flight 197 behind us.
Not until Emily Thorne also feels the pain of this moment.
Save it for trial. This is Mr. Grayson's bail hearing.
It's entrapment. She faked a kidnapping and wired herself.
So you're not disputing Mr. Grayson's assertions?
I don't have to because they're inadmissible.
If I may, Your Honor.
You doubtless recognize the ruse that compelled me
to spew those outrageous claims was of Rube Goldbergian design!
The wheels of conspiracy are shamelessly turning here,
And what I said to my daughter
was obviously the result of my having memorized that fiction
for a press conference I was being forced to stage!
That's a good tale, Mr. Grayson,
But this thick packet of evidence I just received
contradicts that.
So, if you're done grandstanding...
Bail is hereby denied.
Mr. Grayson will be remanded to custody.
Oh, uh, there's one last thing, and I think you ought to hear it.
In light of this new evidence,
I'm reopening the David Clarke investigation.
And I promise you
the wheels of justice will turn as quickly for him
as I'll make sure they will for you.
I was beginning to wonder if I would ever see those words.
Here's to you, David.
All hail the conquering hero.
You did it, Emily.
We all did it.
Seeing his face just reminds me of
all of the people we had to hurt.
Still concerned about what we did to your sister?
Yeah, but if Victoria hadn't gotten away,
I could've told Charlotte the truth.
Instead, she probably thinks
it's the lunatic who's posing as her father.
And... squatting in his cabin.
Turns out...it is the one your grandfather built.
Title transferred to your dad, and...
the world forgot about it.
Well, someone's living there now,
who had his ring.
I need to find out who this imposter is.
Yeah. Let's go.
No, you guys have done enough.
With the kidnapping investigation still active,
we can't all leave town at once.
I'll take care of him.
Non, c'est tout pour le moment.
Merci.
It's done?
It's just a matter of signing the contract, but yes.
You are officially my second-in-command.
I'll fly out to meet the board once you're back.
I'll certainly say good things about you.
Gideon?
What are you doing here?
You seem okay.
Considering the circumstances.
Paris is a circus, so...
I thought I'd come here and fly back with you for the funeral.
You're my big sister, after all.
And my boss.
I hope you understand that.
I never wanted to run the company.
But who can say no to Dad, right?
And you, Daniel? Next in line.
Yeah.
A lot's changed since that semester
I showed you the ropes at boarding school.
I can see that.
Why don't we go out for lunch so I can get up to speed?
And we'll just...
save the tears for Paris, okay?
I know I was an idiot.
Okay? And you tried to warn me.
Well played, Javier.
I was worried you were here for an apology.
Well, you did bitch-slap me
in front of the people I was hoping to call my peers.
Though, I guess, in comparison to everything else that's happened,
it's small change, right?
Has been an eventful few days.
Been out of jail a couple weeks.
Already lost my job, my app...
My mentor...
and my ankle monitor, which is, uh...
why I'm gonna blow town for a bit.
Well, don't go too far.
I've got big plans for Myclone.
What's the point?
It's not even ours anymore, man.
For now.
All right.
You know, I pride myself on being prepared.
Hell, that's what you pay me for.
Well, then, you'd better have a damn good next move.
What's more concerning is theirs.
The Feds reopened the inquiry into Pascal LeMarchal's death,
and you now have motive because they have this.
You're looking at...murder, conspiracy to support terrorism,
perjury, jury tampering.
And they're just getting started.
Maybe it's time to consider taking a plea.
For what?
Life in prison.
So, the tests confirm what you thought?
不匹配
Only that the liar who called herself Amanda Clarke
was in no way related to David.
If she were,
her son would share DNA with Charlotte.
Are you gonna write another letter for me to send?
No. Just be ready to finish the job.
What makes you think Emily is gonna follow the lead?
Because what else would a doting daughter do?
I should've gone with you.
I'm fine. He's not.
And what if there had been more than one of them?
We have gone too far to take a misstep now.
If I lost you -- - You won't.
Good.
But who the hell was he?
Whoever he was, he was working for Victoria.
His phone showed that they spoke this morning.
I think she wanted him to get a DNA sample from me.
So she's on to you.
She thinks she's in the clear,
but there's one person
who can link her to my father's frame-up.
Michelle Banks.
The therapist who locked you away.
And brainwashed me into believing
that my father was evil.
I got results once by posing as her patient.
So you can't go again.
Then I'll convince her to come clean.
Given what's happening with your father,
she should be prepared for the truth to come to light.
I can't believe it.
People are finally talking about my father's innocence.
Soon, everything will be out in the open.
Including us.
I can't wait to see what that feels like.
So...you and Margaux share a father, a homeland,
but...not an accent.
Nor a mother.
After a nasty divorce,
she sent me to boarding school, to New Hampshire,
Just to piss him off.
Inner-family fighting is just a...
Lemarchal tradition.
Well, that explains why you were...
so receptive when I called you.
My sister stole the company out from under me
and now has possession of Myclone --
a billion-dollar property that only you can fix.
Have fixed, my friend.
It'll be multibillion by the time you take the reins
and we partner up.
You must really hate Daniel to trust a total stranger.
Well, your sister's lapdog
has set out to make my life miserable,
which makes you the better of two evils.
Well, since Margaux's first act of office
was to make him second-in-command...
we hurt him, it hurts her, and then...
I take over.
Now...
What do you have in mind?
They checked the cabin where you think your kidnapper lived.
There were signs of struggle.
We'll keep pursuing leads.
God, I'm sorry I never heard his actual voice
or got a good look at him, Detective Reyes.
Don't apologize, Charlotte. You were very brave.
And you're safe now.
Am I?
Call me if you think of anything else.
Thank you.
Charlotte, dear...
were they able to help you?
Don't worry, mom.
I didn't tell them anything I learned about you.
That's not what I -- - Save it.
I'm sure this is already a pretty sad day for you
since my father's case has been reopened...
undoing all that hard work you did years ago.
Do not confuse Conrad's actions with mine.
After everything that's transpired,
I am still putting my children first.
I hope you know how much I love you, Charlotte.
Like you loved David Clarke?
Keep moving, gentlemen.
Step out of line in front of your cell.
Turn and face your cell.
In your cage, Rico.
Close them up on Block Four.
Hold open 218.
Is there a problem, Officer...Mostrowski?
No.
You sad piece of crap.
Not so tough without all that money to protect you, huh?
The only thing I can say for the folks on the plane
is they died quick.
You won't be so lucky.
Get off me, Rinella!
That's enough, man. Come on.
Get up.
Close 218.
That's fine.
I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.
Well, I wouldn't be doing my job
If I turned away someone
concerned about the safety of one of my patients.
Now, on whose behalf are you here?
An old friend of mine.
And yours.
Amanda Clarke.
May she rest in peace.
Who are you?
Oh, that's none of your concern,
but what I imagine hasn't escaped your notice
is the truth about her father.
Conrad Grayson should pay for what he did,
don't you think?
Well, yes. Of course.
As should everybody involved.
I think you know why I'm here.
You want Victoria.
I know you locked Amanda away in exchange for an a-list career.
So I want the promise of your testimony,
anything else you have, and I want it now.
I have records. I'll go get them.
He's all yours.
Please forgive my tardiness.
I know how sacred afternoon tea is to you Brits.
What have you done?
Just leveled the playing field.
I knew that Emily would send you here to do her dirty work.
You really did pick the wrong girl to fall in love with.
Go to hell.
You must hate feeling so vulnerable and manipulated,
much the way you made me feel after you moved into our house...
At the beginning of summer.
Well, summer is finished, Mr. Mathis.
And once that toxin leads to paralysis...
so are you.
Do it!
Emily ripped away my chance for true love.
It's only fair that I do the same for her.
Emily will win.
Loyal to the bitter end.
It's a beautiful sentiment.
And an even better epitaph.
Goodbye, Mr. Mathis.
Nolan, what is it?
Jack...
Turn on the tv.
The infamous case of the United States vs. David Clarke
has been reopened by the FBI
due to the surfacing of new evidence
brought to light in the trial of Conrad Grayson.
The 20-year-old conviction
that landed Clarke in prison for life
has now been officially overturned
by the U.S. District court, thus posthumously
clearing David Clarke of all crimes.
Again, that is breaking news,
and we will have more information
as the night continues.
Emily...
...you did the impossible.
And just two weeks shy of your deadline.
Oh, my god.
I know that all of this came with a price.
Stop.
You haven't only honored your father today.
You honored declan and amanda, too.
They'd be proud of you.
I am.
No more tears, okay?
This is cause for celebration.
Everyone, listen up.
Drinks are on the house.
Did you hear the news?
It happened.
They cleared him.
Aiden?
You okay?
Aiden?
Aiden, are you okay?
Aiden, wake up.
Aiden, wake up!
No, no, no, no, no.
Aiden, wake up!!
No! No, no!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Ems?
I loved him.
More than I ever loved anybody.
I know.
We could've had a life together.
I should've given everything up, but I couldn't.
I couldn't.
Aiden...
dedicated himself to your cause because he loved you.
And not even you could've stopped him.
I pulled him back, Nolan.
He was gone.
And he was happy.
This is my fault.
You know...
Aiden once told me that, uh...
...for most of his life...
he felt broken, but...
that all changed when he met you.
You...were the reason for him to live, Ems.
Now I've lost mine.
I just don't understand.
Why would Emily let the authorities believe
that Aiden's death was a suicide?
There's only one reason.
Emily knows this was Victoria.
She wants her all to herself.
You don't think that she might...
Nolan, we can't let her.
Why not?
Aiden was my friend, too.
And I loved him.
Victoria deserves to die.
I know that.
But Emily was this close to getting her life back.
Doing something like that might rip it all away again.
She needs us.
You're right.
We need to protect her before she goes too far.
Emily.
What are you doing here?
You're an accomplice to murder.
Something has to be done about that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Do not deny it.
I know that you helped Victoria kill Aiden Mathis.
No, t-that's preposterous. Y-you don't have any proof.
I don't need proof!
I'm not going to the authorities.
I can punish you worse than they can.
I-I swear,
I-I didn't have any idea what she had planned.
I just did what Victoria told me to do.
Like you always did.
Let me see my dad.
No.
Because you'd only be pretending to be good.
Like your dad pretended to be a good father.
But he was a good father.
You know the truth.
What did he do?
He hurt people.
Go on.
H-he killed people.
And he lied.
Good girl.
You would be wise to remember that.
No. No, no, no.
No!
Please don't leave me in here! Please!
They destroyed David.
And you... destroyed his daughter.
I'm sorry.
Sorry's not enough.
"When desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.
"And sin... when it is fully grown...
gives birth to death."
As you know, I wanted everything...
And ended up with nothing.
Death would be a luxury compared to this.
My God...
Why are my wants so fathomless?
We all have wants, Grayson.
They just come with a price.
I'm sure I'm the last person you want to see right now.
Got that right.
Despite all of the bad blood between us...
I want you to know that I'm here for you.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Because Jack found this at the cabin.
I'm pretty sure it belonged to your father.
Your abductor had that ring,
Which means he may have desecrated David's grave.
I think you need to move his body to be safe.
Amanda was my best friend.
She would've wanted you to do this.
How dare you speak for amanda?
My father's name has been cleared,
And you want to disturb his final resting place?
Get the hell out!
Fine.
Then I'll do it myself.
Absinthe?
Really, Gid?
Yeah.
You know, the last time I drank this,
I blacked out and woke up in the dean's office.
You're trying to get me into trouble.
That's what you're trying to do.
Tell me, how's life in acquisitions?
Ah, fine. I'm just...
far more interested in acquiring something else at the moment.
Let's invite them over.
I can cry about my dad, and you can cry about yours.
And they'll be putty in our hands.
I'll even let you take the redhead.
You...
I may not have seen you in 10 years,
but I know how you operate.
Why are you really here, Gid?
I'm planning to start my own firm.
I'm buttering Margaux up
so she won't be so pissed when I resign.
Well, in that case, I'm...
I'm glad everything's out in the open.
I'll drink to that.
Stop!
I need to get out of this house!
You're not going to see Emily Thorne!
I heard about her visit.
If you must know,
I despise her almost as much as I despise you.
Oh, I assure you that she will far surpass me on that list
once certain truths come to light.
God, Mom, you sound just as crazy as she did.
What did she say, exactly?
I know you're there.
From the second I laid eyes on you,
I knew something was wrong.
And now this is where it all ends.
Fitting.
I don't think we've come to the end just yet, Victoria.
Well, I'm certain the authorities will disagree once they arrive.
Let them come.
You're the murderer here.
You received my gift.
After what you've done to the ones I love,
you deserve far worse!
I should kill you right now.
I'd get away with it.
No one would miss you.
No one would mourn you.
You destroy everyone who gets close.
Like your father?
All right, let's play.
Amanda Clarke changes her identity
and moves into the house next door to seek revenge.
Well, the truth is
that the man that you remember as your father
and the man I knew... were very different.
Just because you think you know something,
it doesn't make it true.
Then why are you here digging up his grave?
That's where you're wrong.
I'm not digging up my father's grave.
Amanda.
But why?
Did you find her?
No. I've looked everywhere I can think of.
Any luck tracking her phone?
I just found it...
In the toilet.
She ditched it in the tank so I couldn't track her.
Look, I'm just...
I'm gonna stay at the beach house until she turns up.
What the hell is she doing, Jack?
I don't know.
Let's just hope it isn't something she'll regret.
I got to go. Keep me posted.
Why did you hide this from me?!
I didn't want you to get your hopes up unnecessarily.
I wanted to make sure it was really David's first.
So you went to Emily?
She has nothing to do with this.
He's my father.
What are you hiding from me, Jack?
Tell me once and for all.
That's what I thought.
Charlotte, please wait.
I have to go.
Thanks for coming, Father.
Visitor exit, gate "A."
And to think I was expecting another beating.
People think I hate you,
no one looks at me when you're gone.
Transportation will meet you about a mile south.
Bless you, my son.
The riches of heaven surely await you...
in your checking account.
Close them up, gate "A."
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
Sorry to call so late.
How did it go with Gideon?
Oh, we have nothing to worry about.
He's gonna try to start his own company,
which will be a joke.
Oh, that's a relief.
Where are you now?
I think I had a few too many.
Gideon must've...
booked me into a room to sleep it off.
Hey, now that we're both up,
I hate to let a suite at the Sassen go to waste.
Maybe join me for a nightcap?
I'm on my way.
Perfect.
Wait.
Is she --
Did you --
I didn't do it.
I paid her in coke, per her request.
She's the one who didn't know her own limits.
You didn't try to save her?
And incriminate myself?
There was nothing I could do.
Besides, now we have the photo we'll use to blackmail Danny.
It's a win-win.
This isn't how I do business.
Well, it is now.
I'll be in touch.
Where are you, Emily?
Jack Porter?
Is everything okay?
I'm afraid not.
We have reason to believe
that you have information about the abduction of Charlotte Clarke.
We're gonna need you to come down to the station
for some questioning.
I wish I could help you, but --
We can do this the easy way...
or the hard way...
Mr. Porter.
Follow me.
*Softly*
*I will leave you softly*
*for my heart would break*
*if you should wake*
*and see me go*
*So I leave you softly*
No, it can't be.
David?
*Softly*
*I will leave you softly*
*as I leave you there*
*as I leave you there*
Pascal?
Don't struggle.
It'll only make things worse.
What have you done?
You needed help.
I had no choice but to check you in.
Check me in?
Don't worry.
Claremont Psychiatric is the best.
Help me!
Someone help me, please!
You won't get away with this!
Watch me.
What seems to be the problem?
She just woke up. She's panicking.
I don't belong here.
You've been deceived by this woman!
She's been running around under a false identity.
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's been obsessing over this theory for months.
When I found her... digging up Amanda's grave,
I-I tried to calm her down, but she attacked me.
She's lying!
The authorities initiated a 5150 and brought you here.
You can't legally hold me here
without the authority of another doctor!
Oh, but we have one.
Yours.
Michelle?
Doctor, these are my notes
from my sessions with Mrs. Grayson.
They detail her obsession with Miss Thorne,
spiraling into acute psychosis.
Liar!
I just want her to be okay.
No!
Thank you, Dr. Johnson.
Dr. Banks.
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare!
Don't you dare!!
Goodbye, Victoria.
Get better soon.
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's Amanda Clarke! She's Amanda Clarke!!
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's Amanda Clarke!
She's Amanda Clarke!
