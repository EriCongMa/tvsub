bond
what do you think ?
it &apos;s beautiful , sweetheart .
you think she &apos;ll like it ?
of course she will .
i just--i didn &apos;t realize that you two were this serious .
well , chloe and i have been together for 3 years .
it &apos;s time to take the next step .
congratulations .
it &apos;s nice that you found somebody
who loves and supports you .
why are you staring at me ?
look at that smile .
ohh . i never thought i &apos;d see the day .
we &apos;ve been apart for so long .
24 years .
when they took you from me ,
i didn &apos;t know what had happened to you .
i hate that we lost so much time .
but we &apos;re together now ,
and that &apos;s all that matters .
i love you , son .
you &apos;re still having those nightmares , aren &apos;t you ?
they &apos;re becoming more frequent .
it happened again last night .
honey ...
i took a drive to clear my head .
and when i stopped for gas ,
i saw this homeless man .
do you need a ride ?
just trying to make it up the road .
come on , i &apos;ll give you a lift .
oh , god .
oh , god .
my name &apos;s randy .
nice to meet you .
the atlanta field office is asking for our help
in a string of murders
they &apos;ve connected on the hsk database .
last night the body of a john doe was found
in a truck stop rest room in chattanooga , tennessee .
and the day before , the body of 61 @-@ year @-@ old claire westchester
was discovered in a birmingham , alabama , truck stop rest room .
they had both been ...
it &apos;s on your tablets .
they &apos;d been stabbed multiples times ,
and they &apos;d both been posed postmortem .
well , he demeans his victims , that &apos;s for sure .
they &apos;re bound to a urinal with rope .
he left one hell of a calling card .
well , the lack of blood
suggests that they were killed somewhere else
and then disposed of here .
the stab wounds are both shallow and deep .
it could be some sort of systematic torture .
well , there are no obvious signs of sexual assault .
well , he &apos;s sadistic .
the stabbing could be what &apos;s getting him off .
but he doesn &apos;t stop there . he removed their left ears .
he could be keeping them as a trophy .
the disposal sites are 147.6 miles apart .
he probably thought by crossing state lines
he &apos;d prevent the authorities from connecting the two murders .
well , i hate to state the obvious ,
but we &apos;re most likely looking for a truck driver .
atlanta is one of the country &apos;s top long @-@ haul hubs .
it &apos;s one of the few cities
in america serviced by 3 major interstates .
there are hundreds of open cases
on the hsk database ,
and finding this unsub is
going to be like finding a needle in a haystack .
with the ability to move around the nation ,
there &apos;s nothing to suggest he &apos;ll stop anytime soon .
wheels up in 30 .
randy .
there &apos;s something wrong with me .
there is nothing wrong with you .
i mean , between work and this marriage proposal ,
well , you &apos;re just stressed .
you really think that &apos;s all it is ?
of course i do .
you &apos;re my son .
mother will love and accept you no matter what .
there we go !
ohh ! come on , come on !
yes !
no matter what .
no matter what .
&quot; the heart of a mother is a deep abyss ,
at the bottom of which you will always find forgiveness . &quot;
honor√© de balzac .
in a 2009 report , it was suspected that serial killers
operating as long @-@ haul truck drivers
are responsible for close to 500 murders over the last 3 decades .
and that number hasn &apos;t gone down .
so what else do we know about truckers ?
well , most see long @-@ hauling as a lifestyle ,
not a job .
living a life of solitude on the open road .
well , oftentimes that comes with a tremendous amount of stress ,
having to meet scheduled deadlines for months at a time .
and with the right kind of pressure ,
the unsub could have snapped .
victimology speaks to that .
both victims were random ,
john doe appeared to be homeless ,
and claire westchester was the complete opposite .
yeah , looks like she lived in college park for the last 20 years .
she &apos;d been happily married to her high school sweetheart
and taught at the local elementary school .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why go from low- to high @-@ risk victims ?
yeah , these types of unsubs typically target victims
like runaways , transients , and prostitutes .
so apart from each of them being in their early 60s ,
there &apos;s no connection between the two ?
maybe age is the connection . he could be choosing
his victims because they &apos;re easier targets .
or they could be surrogates .
that &apos;s also maybe why he cuts off the ears .
he &apos;s felt ignored all his life .
the victims represent some type of authority figure .
that would explain why claire westchester was targeted .
she was a schoolteacher .
what about a parental figure ?
it &apos;s possible he chose an older male
and an older female victim for a reason .
all right , when we land ,
morgan , you and reid go to the m.e.
dave and jj , go on to chattanooga ,
and lewis and i will get set up at the precinct .
agent hotchner , thanks for coming out .
of course . this is agent lewis .
nice to meet you .
pleasure .
i &apos;ve increased state troopers at truck stops
along all 3 interstates like you &apos;ve asked .
great . any updates ?
so far we &apos;re coming up empty .
i &apos;m coordinating with chattanooga and birmingham p.d.
to have the cctv footage sent over .
has claire westchester &apos;s husband arrived yet ?
he got here a couple minutes ago . he &apos;s waiting .
i &apos;m gonna ... ok .
i &apos;ve got your team set up in the conference room .
right this way .
mr. westchester .
i &apos;m agent lewis .
i &apos;d like , to , uh , ask you a few questions
about your wife , if that &apos;s ok .
sure , yeah .
uh , when was the last time you heard from claire ?
two days ago .
she called me from her lunch break .
did she sound upset or under duress ?
she seemed fine .
her usual upbeat self .
when did you realize that something was wrong ?
usually claire would beat me home from work .
but that day she didn &apos;t .
i tried her cell .
no answer .
i called the school .
they said she &apos;d been gone for hours .
mr. westchester , can you think of anyone
who would want to harm your wife ?
no . everybody loved her .
especially the kids .
i understand that she was a teacher for quite some time .
we couldn &apos;t have any kids of our own ,
so she doted on her students .
she sounds like a wonderful person .
the holidays were her favorite .
she would make sure that every kid
had at least one present to open on christmas morning .
that &apos;s just the kind of person she was .
what have you got , garcia ?
sir , i have come up with 17 potential trucking companies
with active routes near or around the disposal sites .
i crossed and then criss @-@ crossed them with the 3 interstates ,
but none of them fit the timeline .
expand your list to include freelance truckers
and check that against weigh stations along the route .
i &apos;ll hit you back when i have something .
what are you thinking ?
how many truck stops are there
between atlanta and the disposal sites ?
12 . but we &apos;ve canvassed them all .
are any of them non @-@ operational ?
a few are abandoned or closed for renovations .
why ?
because the unsub passed up secluded areas
where he could have delayed the discovery of the bodies .
instead , he did the opposite .
he left them in public places .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense . why would he do that ?
because truck stops aren &apos;t disposal sites ,
they mean something to him .
the manager said the busiest hours for this stop
are between 5 : 00 and 6 a.m.
according to the report , the body was discovered
by a trucker around 3 a.m.
so this guy knew the pattern .
well , the exterior lock was busted .
he didn &apos;t seem too concerned about being interrupted .
all right , well , let &apos;s play this out .
we know this isn &apos;t far from the long @-@ haul hub .
maybe the unsub &apos;s familiar with the area .
likely his route either originated or ended in atlanta ,
which is roughly a 2.1 / 2 hour drive from here .
so being a trucker , he &apos;s used to being on the road
for long periods of time .
exactly . so 2.1 / 2 hours into his route ,
he &apos;s not gonna stop and take a break .
right . trucker &apos;s mentality-- get to where you need to go .
that could be how he knew the traffic flow .
he knew that most truckers heading in and out of atlanta
would just skip over this stop .
it &apos;s still high @-@ risk ,
considering he &apos;s staging a body in a public place .
his compulsion outweighs the risk .
maybe the thrill is what gets him off .
i mean , he had to have known the body would be discovered
sooner rather than later .
pulling off something this calculated and elaborate
speaks to his level of experience .
which means there &apos;s a strong possibility
he &apos;s been killing a lot longer than we thought .
your move .
come on , slowpoke .
i win .
wait , how &apos;d you do that ?
all right , best of 5 .
ok , spill it .
how long are you gonna keep me in suspense ?
did you pop the question ?
she said yes .
lucky girl .
listen , there &apos;s , uh ,
there &apos;s something i wanted to talk to you about .
you and i , we &apos;ve been getting to know one another recently ,
and that &apos;s been wonderful .
now with the wedding coming up ,
i ... i was hoping that my entire family
could be there .
including my biological father .
i was just thinking maybe i could reach out to him--
no . absolutely not .
why ?
that man is the reason you were taken from me .
your father and i had a complicated relationship .
i haven &apos;t spoken to him in years ,
and god only knows where he is .
i didn &apos;t mean to upset you , mother .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just too painful .
let &apos;s keep the past in the past . hmm ?
all right , your turn .
finally got an i.d. on john doe .
frank myers of atlanta .
we were able to i.d. him through his dental records .
looks like he &apos;s been in and out of homeless shelters
for the past couple of years .
for someone on the streets ,
i &apos;d say he has some pretty expensive dental work .
and they &apos;re still trying to locate his next of kin .
have you ruled a c.o.d. ?
exsanguination from penetrating wounds .
in both cases , the killer severed major arteries .
were you able to determine when the ear was removed ?
postmortem .
i also found this .
burlap fibers embedded in both victims &apos; wound tracks .
he stabs them through a bag .
that &apos;s unusual behavior for a sadist .
they get off on watching their victims as they inflict pain .
well , it appears the killer tried numerous times to stab
but hit the bone , before he got it right .
well , this might not be overkill like we initially thought .
this could be exactly the opposite .
yeah , look , there are placement errors and hesitation marks .
which tells me he &apos;s improvising .
he &apos;s struggling through the kill as if it &apos;s his first time .
what if it is ? we could be dealing with a killer
who &apos;s not yet comfortable killing .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . based on the disposal sites ,
we profiled this guy had experience .
yet the actual murders tell a far different story .
where are you ? are we still on for dinner ?
uh , well , i &apos;m not sure yet .
i &apos;m , uh--might be working late again .
is everything all right ?
you &apos;ve been working late the past couple of nights .
i &apos;m fine . just--
trying to finish up a project at work .
randy , come on .
we just got engaged .
we should be enjoying ourselves and celebrating .
i know . i know .
why don &apos;t you
wrap up whatever you &apos;re doing
and come home ?
ok .
well , uh ...
i told mother i would stop by after work .
you can visit her tomorrow .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll understand .
you &apos;re right .
i just need to wrap up a few things .
i &apos;ll be home .
love you . bye .
oh ! god , you scared me .
sorry .
unfortunately , open house is over .
well , i was just hoping to take a quick peek .
my fiancee and i are looking to buy soon .
sure .
i have a few minutes .
that &apos;s all i need .
ok , look , the owners placed the house on the market ,
so , if you think ...
i don &apos;t get it . how could this guy be organized
and disorganized at the same time ?
these are two completely split m.o.s.
we have to consider the unsub might have a partner .
that means he &apos;s a silent partner .
both disposal sites only showed evidence of one person .
chances are if there was a partner ,
he &apos;d somehow want to participate in the kill .
it &apos;s a weird dichotomy , typically seen when an unsub
is in their early stages of becoming a killer .
early stages . as in you think the murderer could be a kid .
no , i think he &apos;s lived with the fantasy for quite some time ,
but it &apos;s only now that he &apos;s finally acting on it .
only things don &apos;t go as planned ,
so he struggles through the murder
trying to match the actual kill
to his long @-@ gestating fantasy .
and it &apos;s only a matter of time before his hesitation
in the actual murder catches up with his staging fantasy .
victim &apos;s name is linda calvary .
worked as a realtor based out of downtown .
janitor discovered the body and alerted police .
the unsub didn &apos;t take her to a secondary location to kill her .
did it right here .
and he placed her in a stall .
maybe he wanted more privacy this time .
didn &apos;t bother using a burlap bag either .
he no longer needs a barrier between him and his victims .
no hesitation marks .
why change his m.o now ?
well , it &apos;s like we profiled . he &apos;s getting more confident .
he might be getting closer to his ideal target .
hey , what up , mama ?
i was able to narrow my search down to 5 trucking companies ,
but they all checked out . none of them
have trucks in transit on those particular routes .
the truck stops aren &apos;t important to him
&apos;cause he &apos;s not a trucker .
they &apos;re important to him for another reason .
with the knowledge this guy has of routes and patterns ,
he &apos;s gotta be connected to someone in the trucking industry .
what is it , garcia ?
i just found some somethin &apos; -somethin &apos; on frank myers ,
before he was homeless ,
he worked in family court services as a public defender in harrington county .
and--and--and there &apos;s more .
our third victim , linda calvary ,
she just got her real estate license a few months ago .
before then , she worked as a nurse
and she testified in a number of the same cases that frank worked .
two out of 3 of the victims worked in the court system .
these victims weren &apos;t random . they were targeted .
and the unsub is working off of a kill list .
it &apos;s time to give the profile .
and then when it &apos;s all combined ,
you slowly add in 3 large eggs ,
just one at a time ...
there you are . i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
you &apos;re not in your usual spot .
i brought you these .
one cup of flour .
half a cup of ground macadamia nuts .
what &apos;s wrong ? everything ok ?
where were you last night ? i waited for you .
i &apos;m sorry . chloe wanted to get dinner
and talk about wedding stuff .
hmm . wedding stuff .
you two just got engaged .
well , she &apos;s excited to start planning .
i know where this is going .
what are you talking about ?
that woman wants to monopolize all of your time .
mother ...
no need to lie to me .
she &apos;s jealous .
chloe just wants to be the only woman in your life .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s not true .
i can &apos;t respect any woman
who tries to come between a mother and her child .
mother , i would never let that happen .
she &apos;s just like the others who tore us apart .
mother , stop .
chloe is not the girl for you .
you can leave now .
we believe the unsub we &apos;re looking for
is what he call a rectification killer .
he &apos;s targeting people that he holds responsible
for a major trauma in his childhood .
these feelings have been festering in his mind for decades ,
as evidenced by the degree of rage .
because of the complexity of these crimes
and their victimology ,
we believe this person to be a white male in his 30s or 40s .
the victims actually interacted with the unsub as a child
when they worked in the family court system .
it &apos;s possible he was removed from his family for his own safety
but was too young in the time
to know the severity of the situation .
now that he &apos;s an adult , he thinks it &apos;s his mission
so seek revenge on those in the legal system
he believes broke up his family .
it &apos;s possible the triggering event
was the separation or death of one or both of his parents .
check for rulings involving a child
being placed into the foster care system or put up for adoption .
this guy &apos;s exhibiting an irresistible compulsion
by posing his victims at truck stop rest rooms ,
despite the escalating risks .
and this indicates that his childhood trauma
may have some direct link to these type of locations .
focus on cases that involve a parent or guardian
connected to the trucking industry
or who have spent long periods of time traveling on the open road .
we believe that locating this case
will be the key to finding him .
thank you .
randy , wake up .
i didn &apos;t hear you come in .
you haven &apos;t been taking your meds ?
i called the pharmacist .
he said you haven &apos;t refilled your prescription in months .
i know .
what are you thinking ?
they weren &apos;t working .
they &apos;re the only thing that works .
chloe , please stop .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve been having those dreams again , isn &apos;t it ?
mother thought it would be best if maybe i stopped taking--
wait . she told you to stop taking your pills ?
and you listened ?
of course i listened .
she &apos;s my mother .
you &apos;ve only known her for a couple of months .
it &apos;s not her place , randy .
first it &apos;s your meds and then it &apos;s your time .
you &apos;re not obligated to spend every waking moment with her .
can &apos;t you see she &apos;s hurting you ?
i said stop !
randy , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
this is the same woman that abandoned you .
she did not abandon me .
i &apos;m starting to think maybe mother was right about you .
we know how the second and third victim are connected ,
but how does claire westchester fit into the puzzle ?
well , let &apos;s go through it again . what do we know about her ?
she was a schoolteacher for close to 30 years .
never had kids ,
but loved her students like they were her own .
she was extremely hands @-@ on ,
especially to those children who she felt were in need .
kids .
kids . wait a minute .
if the unsub is working off a kill list ,
it &apos;s possible he was one of claire &apos;s former students .
that could be our connection .
that makes sense . if there was something off at home ,
she would notice signs of abuse
and report it to the authorities .
she could have been the catalyst
for getting him removed from his home .
but based on our profile ,
he would have been too young
to have known the names of everyone .
not to mention case files weren &apos;t digital .
he wouldn &apos;t have been able
to gain access to that information today .
so how does this guy know who to target ?
maybe the names were fed to him .
we profiled earlier the possibility of a partner .
there could be something to that .
if that &apos;s the case , that person would need to feel
as wronged by the victims as the unsub himself .
a parent .
green for go .
garcia , we think that the unsub may be working with a partner ,
a parent or guardian .
and , baby girl , check school records
for male students who were in claire westchester &apos;s class
going back 30 years .
yeah . keep talking .
it &apos;s possible claire filed a complaint
with the school against the parent ,
which resulted in the unsub being removed from his home .
and cross @-@ check that with hospital records .
he might have made frequent trips to the e.r.
just as randy martin aged out of the system ,
randy jacobs popped up .
but as far as i can tell , he has no criminal history .
he has a stable job .
and he recently got engaged
to his long @-@ time girlfriend chloe andrews .
sounds like he went from a model citizen
to a cold @-@ blooded murderer .
his birthmother flora martin has quite a history , however .
check your tablets .
well , around the time randy would have been conceived ,
flora was admitted to the hospital . she &apos;d been raped .
she was 30 at the time .
it says here she &apos;d been hitchhiking
and was sexually assaulted by a truck driver .
according to her statement , her attacker dragged her
into a truck stop rest room and did bad things .
that &apos;s the exact same . m.o. that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
this case is the nexus .
so mother and son must have recently reunited
and he &apos;s been going off the kill list that she provided .
garcia , what else do we know about flora martin ?
9 months after her alleged rape she gave birth to a son .
there was no father listed on the birth certificate .
so her son is a product of that rape .
where is she now ?
she is ...
in a prison insane asylum
for the murder of 6 truckers .
name of the patient you &apos;re here to see ?
flora martin .
i &apos;m sorry about last night , mother .
i want to show you something .
what is it ?
you &apos;ll see .
what do you think ?
honey , it &apos;s perfect .
i &apos;ll never miss another visit , i promise .
it &apos;s ok , honey .
even when you make mistakes ,
i am always going to love you .
all the hard work you did .
and it is even better than i could have imagined .
you really like it ?
ohh , of course i do .
i mean , what more could a mother ask for ?
honey , what &apos;s bothering you ?
you were right about chloe .
i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t see it .
she wants to tear us apart .
it is not your fault .
that woman is manipulative .
why , you were just blinded by what you thought was love .
now you have to completely free yourself .
how ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you have to kill her .
it &apos;ll make everything better .
so the killer in randy was dormant
until he reconnected with his mother .
you add that to flora &apos;s twisted version of the story ,
there &apos;s your trigger .
yeah , flora &apos;s going after the people
she holds responsible for taking randy away from her .
it explains the dichotomy .
randy committed the murders
based on the blueprint his mother provided .
yeah . and at this point
we &apos;ve got a full @-@ fledged killer on our hands .
once he &apos;s done with that list of names , what happens next ?
well , he &apos;ll either start killing on his own
or flora will continue to manipulate him
into carrying out her own vengeance .
his mother convinced him to get off his meds .
i know , but ...
first i need to get out of here .
i just need to grab my keys .
oh , god . i think he &apos;s back .
stay on the phone with me .
false alarm .
i &apos;m literally walking out now .
see you in a few .
right there .
flora martin ?
oh . i wasn &apos;t expecting visitors .
well , we &apos;re from the fbi .
i &apos;m agent lewis . this is agent morgan .
i see . to what do i owe this honor ?
we &apos;re here to talk to you about your son randy .
we believe he &apos;s been involved in at least 3 murders .
would you know anything about that ?
well , i &apos;ve been locked up here for the last 24 years .
i &apos;m the last person you should be asking .
ms. martin , records show
that your son has been visiting you every day
for the past 3 months .
we think you know quite a bit about it .
in fact , you know what i think ?
i think you know exactly what your son &apos;s been up to ,
and you &apos;re absolutely
thrilled that he picked up where you left off .
randy jacobs , this is the fbi !
clear !
clear !
definitely signs of a struggle .
randy can no longer contain his rage .
he &apos;s unraveling .
by the looks of it ,
he may already have his next victim .
all right , thanks , rossi .
both randy and his fiancee chloe are missing .
hotch just issued an apb .
flora may have convinced randy that chloe was a threat .
we &apos;re running out of time .
hey , you know what ? i think she might be more forthcoming
if it was just the two of us .
i &apos;ll be right outside .
thanks .
do you have any children , agent ?
i don &apos;t .
but i can imagine how rewarding it must be to be a parent ,
see your child grow up and become successful .
i also know that a lot of parents
try to live vicariously through their children .
but for somebody like you ...
it &apos;s about more than just revenge .
for you , every murder that randy commits
allows you to relive your own crimes ,
over and over again ,
down to the last detail .
is that right ?
there is so much anger inside of you
that you would destroy your own son &apos;s life .
i know what happened to you 30 years ago .
i know what that man did to you .
please . please , don &apos;t do this .
we are gonna have some fun .
flora .
i will never forget his face .
or his hands on my skin or the smell of his breath .
he said every time i look in a mirror ...
i would ... remember him .
he &apos;s the reason you started killing .
flora , you killed 6 truckers .
why not more ?
i got caught .
no . no .
you eluded the authorities for months
before they found you holed up in that barn outside the city .
you could have easily kept killing , but you stopped .
it was time to give up .
see , i don &apos;t think you gave up .
i think you stopped
because you found who you were looking for .
the man who raped you .
randy &apos;s father .
his father is out at that barn ,
isn &apos;t he ?
mother was right .
this place is perfect .
somebody help me !
no , please !
please , we can talk .
you &apos;re never gonna understand me .
chloe , open the door .
let me in !
i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
i don &apos;t want to hurt you .
chloe ?
chloe , i &apos;m coming in .
please , randy !
you don &apos;t have to do this .
help ! i &apos;m in here !
randy jacobs , fbi .
let her go .
stay away .
stay away !
drop the knife , randy .
please listen to them .
do you know why you brought chloe here ?
this place means something to you .
you &apos;ve been here before .
randy , your mother &apos;s been using you
since you were a child .
that &apos;s why you were taken away from her .
you were her patsy .
she needed you to continue to do her dirty work .
she was using you back then and she &apos;s still using you now .
randy .
your mother forced you to participate
in the murder of your father .
and then the two of you buried him here .
come on , man .
we all have choices .
it &apos;s not too late for you to choose
to do the right thing .
you do not have to be defined
by the sins of your father or your mother .
come here .
all right . all right .
i &apos;m so sorry .
&quot; the influence of a mother
in the lives of her children
is beyond calculation . &quot;
james e. faust .
flora signed a confession .
she admitted to making randy
participate in his father &apos;s murder .
all this time he seemed to have
such a normal , well @-@ adjusted life .
yeah , but there was always that void inside of him .
even after he found out who his mother was ,
he still wanted to build a relationship .
yeah . and that &apos;s how she was able to play on his emotions .
and he wanted retribution for his mother ,
no matter the cost .
sometimes we let the need to connect
and bond with our families trump any kind of judgment .
and that &apos;s more powerful than anyone can understand .
