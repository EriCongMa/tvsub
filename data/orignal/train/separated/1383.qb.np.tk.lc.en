well , this is it .
if grandma were here , she &apos;d be proud we were doing this .
if she were here , she &apos;d tell me i look fat in this dress .
and that my beard is a health hazard .
she smelled like compost .
i liked her . she had candies .
all right . let &apos;s get it over with .
we bury her with her rock collection ?
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna drop her , guys .
some help here !
i swear this wasn &apos;t me .
do you know what this announcement is all about ?
it &apos;s jane &apos;s news .
just tell me . i &apos;ll act all surprised .
did i mention that i &apos;m doing rounds at the clinic now ?
i &apos;m gonna see three patients today .
okay . good for you .
what &apos;s the news ?
i don &apos;t want to spoil it .
spoil what ?
your announcement .
you didn &apos;t tell her , did you ?
i would never !
all right , what &apos;s going on ? i need to know .
i &apos;m gonna be an instructor at the fbi .
the fbi !
the fbi ?
yeah .
in washington , d.c. ?
yes .
i &apos;m leaving the force .
i thought that you would be thrilled .
i mean , i just never considered that you being safe
would ... mean moving 500 miles away .
343 ... nautical miles .
it &apos;s 7 hours and 7 minutes via route 15 .
well , that &apos;s still really far for a cup of coffee .
when is this happening ?
there &apos;s still a lot of details to work out --
my -- my background check , things like that .
i haven &apos;t told bpd .
i just , you know , wanted you to know .
my daughter , the fbi agent .
i @-@ instructor .
i &apos;m proud of you , janie .
yeah ?
yes .
i love you .
i love you , too .
i &apos;ve never been to washington , d.c.
it &apos;s just like any other big city .
where you can sit in on a session of congress .
or see the world &apos;s largest collection of the bard &apos;s works .
what &apos;s bard ?
who cares ?
okay , don &apos;t say &quot; the bard . &quot;
no-- nobody says &quot; the bard . &quot;
all right . well , the smithsonian has an exhibit
on modern medicine in the great war .
pass .
oh , come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
angela , tell her .
yeah , well , it wouldn &apos;t kill you to have some culture , janie .
but janie don &apos;t like buildings where she can &apos;t touch the walls .
honey , you &apos;re the fbi .
you can touch anything you want .
okay .
come on !
phyllis henderson , 88 -- natural causes .
today is her fu--
was her funeral .
party crasher .
who is he ?
we &apos;re running prints .
he obviously didn &apos;t have his wallet on him .
yeah , can you get a tarp and cover them up ?
the family &apos;s right there .
the family &apos;s okay with it .
i asked the oldest grandson if he recognized our victim .
he said , &quot; maybe grandma used him for food . &quot;
and in this scenario , was granny a cannibal or a vampire ?
either way , they &apos;re good .
you know , the ancient egyptians believed
that burying them together would ensure
that they &apos;re together in the afterlife .
well , maybe granny will knit him a cozy .
yeah , a loincloth for the afterlife .
it looks like he &apos;s been dead for about 12 hours .
this is a very odd wound .
it appears that he got run through with
some sort of cylindrical object .
and he &apos;s very clean .
yes , but a wound like this would have bled profusely .
the family said that the funeral was
at mason funeral home in mission hill .
they had the casket until the hearse picked it up
and brought it here this morning .
i hate funeral homes .
sorry , mrs. henderson .
i &apos;m sure someday ,
all of you will look back on this and laugh .
some sooner than others .
hi , grandma !
t.j. !
oh , what a wonderful surprise !
where &apos;s your daddy ?
hey , ma . i was feeding the meter .
hey , don &apos;t &quot; hey , ma &quot; me .
why didn &apos;t you call ?
i had no idea you were coming .
we wanted to surprise you .
t.j. &apos; s been asking about you .
and i needed to see some rizzoli faces
besides the one in the mirror .
oh , are you a bad liar .
how do you know ?
you got spies in chicago ?
hey , teri . this is t.j.
and you know , teri &apos;s got some ice cream in the back .
want some ?
yes .
yes .
go ahead .
so ...
lydia met somebody else .
yeah , i just ... felt like it would be best to make a clean break .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sure this is a difficult time for you .
yeah , it has been , but we &apos;ll get through it .
just need to figure out what we &apos;re doing next .
all right . i &apos;ll tell you what you &apos;re gonna do .
t.j. &apos; s having some ice cream .
i &apos;m gonna make you a sandwich .
and then we &apos;ll go to jane &apos;s townhouse .
she &apos;s got an extra room .
are you sure ?
i mean , it &apos;s two of us now .
tommy , if i told you once , i &apos;ve told you a hundred times --
there can &apos;t be too many rizzolis !
i missed you .
missed you , too , ma .
okay .
for the record , when it &apos;s my time , not this .
anything but this .
i &apos;ve always wanted to see a viking funeral .
what , like burial at sea ?
yeah , but they light you on fire first .
i &apos;m in .
yeah .
may i help you ?
yes , uh , we need to speak to someone
regarding phyllis henderson &apos;s funeral , please .
that service was this morning .
mr. mason , our owner , handled those arrangements .
do you know where we could find him ?
i haven &apos;t seen him .
korsak .
excuse me .
is this mr. mason ?
yes .
is everything all right ?
is there a family member we could talk to ?
uh , yeah . his sister &apos;s in the prep room .
thank you very much .
something tells me this case is gonna be a weird one .
ugh . it &apos;s freezing in here .
he probably doesn &apos;t mind .
hello ?
i &apos;ll be right there .
korsak .
is that blood ?
could be castoff .
oh , that would make a nice murder weapon .
could we be standing in our crime scene ?
hello ?
kate mason ?
yes .
can i help you ?
my brother &apos;s body was in mrs. henderson &apos;s casket ?
yes .
i &apos;m gonna need to ask you a couple questions .
when was the last time you saw your brother ?
last night , around 8 : 00 .
he was finishing with mrs. henderson when i left .
why are they taking my trocar ?
your what ?
trocar -- it &apos;s used to suction fluids out of organs
in the abdominal cavity .
well , it &apos;s possible that your brother
was stabbed with a similar object .
csru found this in the incinerator .
that &apos;s sam &apos;s apron .
they burned his clothes ? why would someone do that ?
probably so he couldn &apos;t be traced
back to your funeral home .
who else has access to the prep room , besides yourself ?
sam and i are usually the only ones who go in there .
it upsets most people .
wait -- are you asking me that because you think
i had something to do with this ?
i did not hurt my brother .
we said good night , and i went bowling .
that was the last time i saw him .
we &apos;ll need you to confirm that .
of course .
you should talk to that woman he &apos;s been seeing .
what woman ?
i saw her pick him up after work a few times .
i figured he had a new girlfriend
he wasn &apos;t ready to tell me about .
would that have been typical of him ?
no . he didn &apos;t really keep secrets .
and he &apos;d been jumpy about it , you know ?
like something was on his mind .
all right . we &apos;ll be in touch .
are you sure it was him ?
yes . i &apos;m sorry .
hi . thank you .
mr. gomez , please come in .
the doctor will see you now .
hello . i &apos;m dr. isles .
uh , they don &apos;t really speak english .
we were waiting for dr. hope .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s out of town .
i &apos;m covering for her .
dr. hope has always been there for our family .
well , i &apos;m her daughter .
i &apos;m not as experienced as her , but i &apos;ll do my best to help .
is this ana ?
yes .
doctors at the hospital say that she will die ,
that there &apos;s nothing that they can do to help her .
hello .
she &apos;s beautiful .
according to her bloodwork , ana has biliary atresia .
her liver is failing .
it could be related to her autoimmune system .
we &apos;re not fully sure , but it is terminal .
can you help her ?
well , currently , there is no treatment
for this condition and no cure ,
so i &apos;m afraid i have to agree with ana &apos;s other doctors .
the best we can do is make her comfortable .
until she dies ?
well , her alkaline phosphatase tests ...
... look dangerously high .
do you mind if we pray for you ?
of course not .
but i must emphasize -- the prognosis ,
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s out of my hands .
we agree .
it is in much higher hands than yours .
i can &apos;t believe sam was murdered .
it &apos;s awful .
his cellphone records show
that you two communicated a lot lately .
that &apos;s true .
cleaning staff at the funeral home said
they saw you there last night .
i was supposed to meet him ,
but he was gone by the time i arrived .
were you there for a date ?
what ? no .
i &apos;m a broker . he hired me to sell his business .
the funeral home ?
yes .
he said he wanted to sell as quickly as possible .
i had an offer from a big chain mortuary ,
and i was bringing him the papers to sign .
did he say why he was selling ?
he said he was fed up with the business .
i figured they had money problems .
a lot of these places do .
he was in such a hurry to sell .
he told me he &apos;d even sell undervalue if necessary .
what did kate mason have to say about that ?
who ?
his sister and business partner .
he never mentioned anything to me about a business partner .
he said he wanted out as quickly as possible .
he was trying to sell the family business
from right under her nose without telling her .
and for no apparent reason .
the funeral home was in the black .
so were his personal accounts .
maybe he was just sick of it .
well , i get that , but why not tell the sister ?
he was trying to rip her off , and she found out ?
here you go .
yeah , and then she stabbed him
with the organy suctiony thing .
trocar .
yeah . yeah , yeah . thanks .
her alibi checked out . she was bowling .
till 10 : 00 . i mean , she still could have done it .
okay , this is , like , 90 % foam .
what is yours ?
what ?
i got an interesting call earlier this week .
yeah ?
from the fbi , vetting their newest hire .
i was gonna tell you about it .
when you handed me your resignation ?
n @-@ no . when the -- the time was right .
which is when ?
which is when i can think about not seeing you every day
and not cry about it --
which is ... not now , so ...
okay , this is a $ 5 cup of crap !
just so you know ...
i think what you &apos;re doing is really great .
really ?
i &apos;m happy for you .
and i don &apos;t want to make you cry , but ...
i &apos;ll miss you .
what &apos;d you tell them ?
oh , i gave them a thorough character assessment .
what does that mean ?
do you find anything ?
not much , but i did confirm
that the blood spatter on the ceiling was his .
well , that &apos;s something .
actual cause of death was transverse thoracic impalement ,
likely from the trocar .
how gross is that thing ?
well , i &apos;d say it &apos;s rather innovative .
i mean , how else would you propose
draining fluids from a body ?
i don &apos;t .
because i &apos;m having a viking funeral .
korsak is gonna shoot a flaming arrow
at my dead body on a boat and just -- &quot; fzzt ! &quot;
rizzoli bonfire .
‭ can &apos;t wait .
that &apos;s not really how norse funerals are done .
party pooper .
fine . is that it ?
forensically speaking , yes .
but i do have something else you might be able to use .
the fact that the victim was a funeral director
reminded me of a case that came in from essex county
about six weeks ago .
the victim was stabbed to death and thrown into a grave .
and it turns out that the grave was dug
for a casket from mason &apos;s funeral home .
stranger still , the body was embalmed .
wait -- aren &apos;t all bodies embalmed ?
no , uh , not the deceased person in the casket ,
but the murder victim in the dirt .
huh . that &apos;s a twist .
can you tell if the same person embalmed both bodies ?
well , the technique used for both bodies was the same ,
so in my opinion , yes .
would you say said person was sam mason ?
i might , if i could see records
of his most recent work for comparison .
done .
ooh . how &apos;d it go at the clinic ?
a family prayed for me to help their baby .
is that a bad thing ?
it &apos;s a very grim case ,
so i just don &apos;t see what good it could do .
well , that &apos;s between them and whomever they &apos;re praying to .
i &apos;m a doctor , so i don &apos;t believe --
i know , but ...
can &apos;t hurt , can it ?
i &apos;ve been dealing with essex county homicide .
their murder is still unsolved .
did they give you any information you can use ?
ben norton -- he &apos;s 22 , unemployed ,
lived in roxbury with two roommates .
did he know our victim ?
not that i can confirm .
but he and kate mason attended the same college
in fairfield , connecticut .
doesn &apos;t mean they know each other .
they might have .
okay , so , kate mason knows ben norton
and kills him for some reason .
she then asks her brother to help her dispose of his body ?
sam mason embalms the body to buy time and then ditches it
when the next funeral comes their way ?
but then what ? he just freaks out and wants to sell the business
so he can get away from his sister ?
could be , but she finds out about it and gets rid of him .
but she can embalm people herself .
why rope her brother into it ?
guess we &apos;re gonna have to ask her .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
i don &apos;t know this person .
you didn &apos;t cross paths with ben norton at fairfield college ?
not that i &apos;m aware of .
yet , you know that his body was buried in a grave
that was dug for one of your clients , correct ?
i knew that a body had been found in essex county ,
that there was an investigation .
okay , but you didn &apos;t mention that when we spoke .
my brother just died .
i was thinking about him .
that thing in essex never even occurred to me .
but you see the coincidence , right ?
this victim died of stab wounds .
your brother was stabbed .
both bodies were found in graves
for clients of your funeral home .
yes . i guess .
who inherits sam &apos;s share of the business now that he &apos;s gone ?
our parents are dead . i guess i do .
so i guess it &apos;s good that the sale didn &apos;t go through , huh ?
what sale ?
sam had an offer from hilldale holdings
to buy the mortuary .
the woman you saw him with was a broker .
sam would never sell me out . we were partners .
what do i have to do to convince you i didn &apos;t do this ?
you can help us solve this thing .
we would like the information on every body
that you and your brother embalmed .
fine .
am i gonna need a lawyer or something ?
that &apos;s up to you .
do you have something you feel like you &apos;d like to hide ?
the funeral home sent over their files .
i , uh , just left them on your desk .
thank you .
how &apos;s the baby ?
the clinic called .
her breathing has become erratic .
yeah , well , that &apos;s to be expected , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , unfortunately .
you know , i &apos;ve read every pediatric journal in print ,
and i can &apos;t find anything to help her .
i know .
i know empirically that there &apos;s nothing i can do ,
but ...
i just can &apos;t stop feeling responsible .
i &apos;m sorry , maura .
me too .
yeah ! aw ! beat me again !
this kid &apos;s like a shark !
so , when do i get to meet ron , the handsome cardiologist ?
oh , whenever you want . he &apos;s around .
you really reinvented yourself , huh ?
well , so did you .
plumbers &apos; union -- that &apos;s a big deal .
i &apos;m happy you finished your training .
chicago &apos;s been good to us .
chicago &apos;s too far away .
i needed to get away . i felt smothered here .
by who ? by me ?
no .
you know , i just had to be on my own , grow up .
well , you grew up .
i &apos;m proud of you .
thanks , ma .
now it &apos;s t.j. &apos; s time to grow up .
yeah , he &apos;s growing up so fast , he &apos;s giving me whiplash .
aren &apos;t you ?
and he &apos;s gonna beat you again .
you know , if you move back , i could help you with t.j.
no smothering .
i don &apos;t know , ma .
i &apos;m just putting it out there .
i mean , it &apos;s your decision , and i &apos;ll respect it .
you want to stay here with grandma ?
yes .
oh , no ! you beat her again ! really ? ! are you kidding me ? !
all right . so , two d &apos;s .
okay . and last name --
what are you doing ?
the fbi called me for a background check .
i &apos;ll have to call you back .
i was gonna tell you .
it &apos;s okay . i understand .
you wanted to wait till everything was final .
but , you know , i realized that after you leave ,
i &apos;m not gonna be able to come in here
and hug you whenever i want .
you never come in here and hug me whenever you want .
until now .
what ? oh , god . no !
what -- just -- what did maura say ?
well , she ruled out the sister .
based on what ?
the sister was left @-@ handed .
that means she had a completely different embalming technique .
sam did the embalming . they &apos;re positive .
she was telling the truth .
i cross @-@ referenced the funeral home records
with those from local cemeteries .
there are some gaps .
&quot; omissions &quot; are probably more accurate .
these are cemetery records
burials of caskets that came from mason &apos;s funeral home .
but some of them don &apos;t exist in mason &apos;s files .
somebody &apos;s scrubbing the books .
to make it look like these funerals never happened ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll get a ground @-@ penetrating radar team out to the cemeteries
whose records don &apos;t line up with mason &apos;s .
hey , is smitty in today ? it &apos;s korsak .
do not hug me .
nice day for an exhumation .
this a recent mason &apos;s funeral ?
well , according to the cemetery , yes .
but according to the funeral home ...
it never happened .
the burial was nine days ago .
our radar team got an anomalous reading .
it looks like the corpse has two heads .
i wonder if that &apos;s how frankie put it in the warrant .
how are you doing , by the way ?
well , we have another cemetery to cover after this
and the mausoleums .
i meant about jane leaving .
i &apos;m struggling , to be honest .
i &apos;m happy for her , of course ,
and i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the right decision .
but you don &apos;t want her to go .
is that very selfish of me ?
if it is , we &apos;re in the same boat .
detective , i &apos;m ready .
at least the poor girl still has her clothes on .
in all , we &apos;ve found four bodies
in other people &apos;s graves or caskets --
sam mason , ben norton ,
now greta shaw and anne hart .
so he &apos;s a serial killer ?
well , if we go down that road ,
ben norton was probably his first kill .
he was sloppy -- just dumped him in the dirt .
then the next two were planned more carefully .
he waited for a funeral to come along
so he could put the victims &apos; bodies into the caskets .
decent theory .
we know he was embalming them .
why do that ?
well , he worked for the mob or a hit man .
how did he get mixed up in that ?
i don &apos;t know .
but whether or not he killed these people ,
i know he didn &apos;t then kill himself
and jump naked into the casket .
true .
so , if we figure out who killed sam mason ,
we might be able to find who killed the other three .
i heard about jane &apos;s fbi decision .
how are you doing ?
okay .
by which , you mean not okay at all ?
well , denial &apos;s working in my favor right now .
it &apos;s hard to imagine her leaving .
can you picture this place with only one rizzoli in it ?
you &apos;re all the rizzoli i need .
you know , it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve been up this close
and personal with an embalmed body .
you can hear yourself when you speak , correct ?
i meant when i was at school , jane .
spent a lot of time with old gertrude .
gertrude ?
it &apos;s his medical cadaver , not a weird girlfriend .
‭ she was a great old gal .
you know , she donated her body to the university
&apos;cause she always wanted to go to medical school .
think i &apos;ve got a picture of her somewhere around here .
okay , hi . uh , can we talk about these two bodies , please ?
yes .
so , we conducted side @-@ by @-@ side autopsies ,
and both bodies had stab wounds on the upper @-@ right abdomen .
but the actual cause of death was dry drowning .
sounds painful .
it is .
the lungs become unable to extract oxygen from the air --
in this case , a result from a puncture wound .
so , the killer stabbed these two
specifically to puncture their lungs ?
yes , which is why it leads me to believe
that sam mason is likely not the killer .
both women have multiple stab marks on their abdomen ,
suggesting that the killer made several attempts
before finally piercing the lung .
so he was guessing about where to stab them .
or he didn &apos;t have the tools
to fatally puncture the lung on the first try .
that doesn &apos;t sound like sam mason .
anatomical expertise defines a mortician &apos;s work .
okay , so , if sam didn &apos;t kill these two ,
why did he embalm them ?
i &apos;m afraid they can &apos;t tell us that .
maybe he was in such a hurry to sell because he knew
that there were more murdered victims headed his way .
that &apos;s why he wanted out .
oh , you guys , i &apos;ve missed this .
mmm . we &apos;re gonna have to hang out as much as possible
before you ship out .
okay , i &apos;m not enlisting in the army .
you excited ?
i am .
i am , but , i mean , you know , leaving home is --
it &apos;s hard . i get it .
now that lydia &apos;s gone , i &apos;m , uh ...
thinking about coming back here .
really ? that &apos;d be great !
yeah . tommy , i @-@ i @-@ i could talk to the professor .
you -- you could take over the place for me here .
i mean , ma &apos;s just down the road .
well , it &apos;d be nice for something good
to come out of this whole thing .
but i &apos;m sorry it didn &apos;t work out between you and lydia .
eh , it &apos;s for the best .
i mean , i think i &apos;ll just stick to the dad thing ,
leave the husband stuff to somebody else .
all right . well , don &apos;t , you know , give up totally .
i mean , you guys just weren &apos;t right for each other , you know ?
or maybe us rizzolis aren &apos;t cut out for marriage .
speak for yourself .
i don &apos;t know . ma might agree with him .
come on , frankie . look at us .
lone wolves . runs in the family .
it &apos;s not a genetic disorder .
you just got to find the right person .
all right . take korsak .
he probably never thought he &apos;d get married again .
but look at him now . the guy &apos;s never been happier .
you got a point .
thank you .
you guys are loud !
oh ! sorry , t.j.
i got it . i got it .
yes , we are ! we are so loud !
hey , did i ever tell you the story
about the little green man named yoda ?
no .
no ? !
mm @-@ hmm . okay , come on . let me tell you .
oh , you &apos;re gonna love this one . it &apos;s awesome .
have you been here all night ?
yeah .
i just haven &apos;t been able to sleep .
i &apos;ve been , um , thinking about the baby .
were there any changes ?
well , they said her color improved a little bit
after i had the nurse adjust the fluids and electrolytes .
okay , well , that &apos;s something .
not enough .
you know , in homicide , the stakes are high ,
but ... not like this .
i just ...
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna face her family today .
well , maura , you may not have the answer ,
but you &apos;re the perfect doctor for that baby .
how &apos;s that ?
because the work that you &apos;re doing
takes compassion and courage ,
and that &apos;s what that family needs right now .
what am i gonna do when you &apos;re not here ?
you &apos;ll pick up the phone .
as will i.
it &apos;s not the same .
no , it &apos;s not .
but we &apos;ll get through it , like we always do .
together ?
i was gonna say &quot; with wine . &quot;
but ... yeah .
together .
still working on the connection between our victims .
each of them disappeared in the last few months ,
but there were no missing @-@ persons reports filed for any of them .
transients ?
not homeless , but they did move around a lot .
so disappearing wouldn &apos;t be a red flag
for people that knew them .
did they know each other ?
not that i can tell .
looks like their cellphone records
have exactly one number in common .
i &apos;m running the reverse trace now .
please be sam mason .
they &apos;re models ?
if our killer targeted young , attractive people in the area ,
a modeling agency would be filled with victims .
and we don &apos;t know who he is yet .
so a lot of people are still in danger .
i &apos;ll drive .
my models mostly book print work --
catalogs , brochures .
they go to new york or l.a. if they have higher aspirations .
so it &apos;s normal for your clients to just disappear ,
like these three ?
well , they stop checking in , i assume they moved on .
it happens every day .
is there any other information that you can give us
about these three -- something they had in common ,
a reason why someone might target them ?
well , ben booked a high @-@ end car campaign .
greta is my swimsuit girl .
and anne was a domestic diva --
diapers , cleaning products , that sort of thing .
we &apos;re gonna need the information
on all the meetings and auditions you sent them on .
sure . - also an employee list --
anyone they might have crossed paths with here .
i hate to think of my people in danger .
hello , everyone .
how is she ?
uh , they said that you ordered more tests ?
yes -- hemoglobin and bilirubin .
we need to monitor how her condition is advancing .
sarah ?
yes , dr. isles ?
when were these samples drawn ?
last night .
do another blood draw .
i also need a cortisol analysis and another liter of fluid .
and please call dr. harris at the hospital .
tell him i &apos;m bringing a patient in immediately .
okay .
w @-@ what is it ?
well , it &apos;s too -- too soon to say ,
but seems to be some marked improvement in some crucial factors .
it &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you brought us our miracle .
well , they &apos;re all gorgeous . that &apos;s for sure .
think that &apos;s what got them killed ?
i don &apos;t know . the agency records -- that was a dead end ?
these three never intersected on auditions
or booked the same job .
i was hoping for a shampoo commercial
or a newspaper ad -- something .
like that .
look -- one , two , three .
are they all standing in the same place ?
yeah .
that &apos;s the farmers market on beacon street .
well , so that must mean that they used the same photographer .
if that &apos;s true , they would have paid him for these shots .
okay , let &apos;s go through their bank accounts .
he &apos;s got to be in there somewhere .
i &apos;m uncomfortable with this . eddie &apos;s a very private man .
he &apos;s also a number @-@ one suspect in a murder investigation .
maybe we could just wait for him to return ?
we &apos;d prefer to do it our way .
trophies .
yep .
this guy &apos;s whole m.o. is a slow death .
plenty of time to take pictures .
jesus .
his calendar says he &apos;s got a shoot booked right now .
farmers market &apos;s a couple blocks from here .
perfect . now turn away from me and look back .
it &apos;s just , i have this mole .
very easy to touch that up .
really ?
let &apos;s , uh , take these back to the studio .
i &apos;ll show you how i do it .
okay .
police !
out of the way ! out of the way !
out of the way !
move , move , move , move !
you got him ?
yeah .
get up .
get up !
you know you &apos;re gonna miss this part , right ?
yeah . yeah , i am .
‭ we &apos;ve known eddie for years .
his parents were killed in a car accident when he was 16 .
sam looked out for him after that .
sounds like your brother had a big heart .
in his confession ,
did eddie say why sam embalmed those victims ,
why he didn &apos;t go to the police ?
because of you .
me ?
eddie had told sam that if he stopped helping him
or if he went to the authorities ,
then he would come after you .
he was trying to protect me .
yeah . your brother loved you very much .
i guess that &apos;s the most important thing
to hang on to right now .
thank you , detective .
sure .
hey . you got my text .
yeah .
i wasn &apos;t sure you actually used that .
all the time .
i got this app on my phone that tells me what &apos;s overhead ,
and then i just use my handy telescope
to find it for myself .
what are we looking at tonight ?
uh , cassiopeia .
ah , the african queen .
famously beautiful .
but poseidon banished her into the sky for her vanity .
seems like there &apos;s worse punishments than being up there .
oh , yeah . you &apos;re right .
prometheus gets his liver pecked out by a bird
every day for all of time .
yeesh .
how do you know all that ?
i like myths .
yeah ?
they &apos;re epic , you know ?
it &apos;s all passion and romance
and love that spans eternity .
this is great .
it &apos;s perfect .
i agree .
do you ?
&apos;cause right now , looking at you under the stars ...
‭ i think the greeks had it right .
what , about liver pecking ?
about eternity .
i ...
i want us to be like this forever .
nina holiday ...
will you marry me ?
yeah !
yeah ?
yeah .
yeah ?
i forgot the rolls .
i got the rolls .
okay .
okay , i need another beer .
i got it .
who gave him sugar ? ma ?
i gave him some juice .
what kind of juice ?
a ... popsicle .
a popsicle ?
ma , you can &apos;t give him a popsicle for dinner !
look , there need to be some ground rules
if we &apos;re gonna be living here .
you mean it ?
yeah , the professor said yes .
so , my daughter is gonna be out of harm &apos;s way .
my grandson will be living right next door .
wow . it &apos;s a gift from heaven .
what about your son ?
yeah , what about your other son ?
yeah , we &apos;re gifts from heaven , too , right , ma ?
yeah , yeah . shut it and eat your bucatini .
you okay ?
oh . yeah , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just distracted .
the baby &apos;s improving , right ?
yes -- on every level .
and her labs are almost normal .
most people would say that with a smile .
i know . i know .
but it just doesn &apos;t make sense ,
and i &apos;m having a hard time accepting it .
okay .
come with me .
where are we going ?
just a place i like to think .
uh , we &apos;ll be right back . okay ?
uh , ma , we &apos;ll be right back . we &apos;ll be right back .
oh , yeah . crouton hoops . hit me . hit me .
that was amazing .
okay , cut it out , cut it out .
don &apos;t let him -- don &apos;t show him that . come on .
terri , bring me the broom .
i know i should just be happy ,
and i &apos;m . ana is gonna live a long
and healthy life . it &apos;s just ...
it bothers me that i can &apos;t explain it .
you know , maura , some things don &apos;t have an explanation .
yeah , but the science was indisputable .
there was no reason to expect
an improvement , much less a recovery .
and yet it happened .
look , i &apos;m not gonna say it was a miracle .
sometimes i like to ... play a game ,
&quot; what if it didn &apos;t happen . &quot;
for example ,
what if my apartment didn &apos;t burn down ?
then you wouldn &apos;t have moved into the professors &apos;s townhouse .
exactly , and then tommy and t.j.
wouldn &apos;t have a place to live that &apos;s close to ma .
i like this . do another one .
okay ...
what if you didn &apos;t have your brain injury ?
if i hadn &apos;t gotten hurt , then maybe i wouldn &apos;t
have pursued other experiences , like working at the clinic .
then the baby wouldn &apos;t have had you there .
so , everything happens for a reason ?
whether we can explain it or not .
we &apos;re all ... part of a bigger plan .
a very unsicentific explanation .
maybe , but it ...
helps me get through things .
like leaving home ?
yeah .
i &apos;m gonna need more science
to make myself feel better about that .
okay .
yeah , no , i got nothing .
i &apos;m still not gonna say it was a miracle .
doesn &apos;t mean that wasn &apos;t .
