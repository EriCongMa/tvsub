第七季 第四集
hello , loyal followers .
it &apos;s alexa , back from oregon .
got to love the beaver state .
there &apos;s trees galore , awesome hiking .
but i went because of their physician @-@ assisted suicide law .
this brain tumor ,
this glioblastoma multiforme--
which sounds like the worst ikea piece ever--
it , um ...
it just keeps getting worse and worse .
so ... i just dined on some applesauce du jour
with broken @-@ up pentobarbital mixed in .
my last supper .
some gallows humor .
i just ...
i can &apos;t live with the pain anymore .
i don &apos;t want to live with only misery to look forward to .
you can see why i want this video excluded from trial , your honor .
it is intended to bias the jury .
bias is exactly what i &apos;m trying to avoid , your honor .
the fully @-@ abled have a bias of @-@ of the blessed .
they can &apos;t fathom what it would be like to have
to make a decision like the one alexa banner had to make .
and yet , sad as ms. banner &apos;s story is ,
this video has no relevance ...
sorry , your honor .
it @-@ it , uh ... it is merely an attempt ...
... to ... ah .
here , i ... look , i can give ...
oh , thank you .
yes .
uh , the bottom line is that what doctors pogue
and , uh , brinton did is illegal .
hence , this wrongful death suit .
state law is very clear .
physician ...
your honor .
uh , physician @-@ assisted ...
suicide .
it &apos;s ...
i , uh ...
you were talking about state law ,
which you seem to believe is very clear .
thank you .
who &apos;s winning ?
um , my clients can speak to alexa &apos;s ...
excuse me ?
between the two , who &apos;s winning ?
uh , i have no idea .
i think you do .
do i know you ?
your honor ...
i don &apos;t even think
canning needs those canes .
i think they &apos;re props .
sir , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt , but i @-@ i have to focus on this .
i know .
i &apos;m mr. dipple &apos;s general counsel .
ethan carver .
are you checking up on me ?
no . him .
the bottom line is that this wrongful @-@ death suit ...
that &apos;s why he &apos;s fired ,
and you &apos;re replacing him .
mr. dipple assured me
that i would not have to argue in court .
what does &quot; awttw &quot; mean in a text ?
my role was to prep mr. oakman and help him anticipate
what the defense would argue , that &apos;s all .
&quot; a word to the wise . &quot;
thank you . god , i hate texts .
it &apos;s the ugliest language on the planet .
mr. carver , i am not arguing in court .
you are , ms. lockhart .
you &apos;ve been prepping this case for the last six months .
but not to argue in court .
this is an anti @-@ euthanasia case .
no , it &apos;s a pro @-@ parent case .
the parents of a girl who committed suicide ...
but mr. dipple wants to use this in order to beat back advances
in physician @-@ assisted suicide , right ?
i can &apos;t support that . i am pro @-@ euthanasia .
ms. lockhart , i hate being the bully here .
i get very tense .
mr. dipple compensates you very well .
if you don &apos;t take over this case , we will lose .
there is no one else who knows it as well as you .
as a devil &apos;s advocate .
yes , but
who knows the advocate &apos;s case better than the devil ?
all rise ! court is now in session .
let &apos;s get this show on the road .
gentlemen , good day .
you have been arrested .
it is our task today to figure out whether
you deserve bail and the amount .
think of it as the sorting hat from harry potter .
we &apos;re sorting you ...
so , where are we ?
i lead with 12,560 pounds .
come on , you do not .
i got the last guy . 320 pounds .
it was on his arrest report .
so , who &apos;s second ?
we have a tie , bernie , and ...
good morning .
hello .
what &apos;d i miss ?
we just got back from lunch , and we &apos;re tied .
11,300 pounds : alicia .
11,250 pounds : bernie . a virtual tie .
i &apos;m sorry . what ? and don
brings up the rear .
it &apos;s only &apos; cause i get anorexic shoplifters .
more sinned against than sinning .
don at 9,650 pounds
of anorexic shoplifters .
excuse me .
but what are we talking about here ?
&quot; perps by the pound . &quot;
it &apos;s shoplifting day .
everyone with light fingers gets processed today .
and we &apos;re tied at 11,300 pounds .
virtually .
pounds of what ?
perps . clients .
you clear enough cases , you can beat lucca .
are you guys serious ?
yes , whoever wins
gets first choice of what days to work .
you &apos;re competing over who clears the most cases by weight ?
we &apos;re competing .
oh , i &apos;m not .
uh , you &apos;re in second place . yes , you are .
are we all understanding ?
none of you are indigent , which means
you must pay for your own attorney .
the chicago bar has provided us with four bar attorneys .
please stand .
they are available for hire at your convenience .
i want to be clear : you do not need to hire them .
if you do not hire them , you will be pushed
to the back of the line , which means
you will not be sorted until tomorrow .
are we all understanding ?
bully . here we go . ms. quinn ,
you have males 98 through 117 .
mr. bukovitz , 118 through 135 .
mr. weingarten , 136 to 151 .
and mrs. florrick , 152 to 170 .
male number 118 .
all right , matan ...
male number 118 .
it &apos;s on your hand ! look at your hand !
i &apos;ve been appointed your bond attorney ...
male 98 ? where are you ?
male 98 ?
too bad , lucca .
male 28 , daniel rojas , attempted shoplifting .
good . good , yeah , keep lucca from winning . she always wins .
i &apos;m not playing .
well , that &apos;s fine with me .
but what are you gonna do , not clear his case ?
do you speak english ?
male 136 .
male 152-- retail theft in the amount of $ 45 .
what do you got , mr. brody ?
a repeat offender . nine months probation .
mr. mason pleads guilty , your honor .
good . time served . male 98 !
good , wipe that cocky smile off bernie &apos;s face .
i &apos;m not playing . i &apos;m not !
58 , ms. brantley , liquor store theft ?
uh , ma &apos;am , over here .
i &apos;m innocent . i really am .
ma &apos;am , this is
your first arrest . the judge &apos;ll go easy on you ,
you &apos;ll get probation , go home today .
but i didn &apos;t steal anything .
it was a gift . i brought it back so i could
exchange it for something else .
look , there &apos;s no time for this .
they &apos;re saying i was making a false return , like
i stole it so i could get money .
if you want to fight this ,
it &apos;ll take months of your life and thousands
of dollars to defend yourself .
you want to say i &apos;m guilty , but i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t look at my kids and say ...
look , there &apos;s no time to discuss this .
the state &apos;s attorney might even add charges
if you insist on your innocence .
he can do that ?
he can do whatever he wants . he &apos;s a real son of a bitch .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m not guilty .
okay .
i &apos;ll talk to the prosecutor and see what i can get ,
but you have to get yourself into this new frame of mind , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;re under arrest .
sometimes it doesn &apos;t make a difference if you did it or not .
you trying to guess my weight ?
excuse me ?
i heard your friends laughing .
you @-@ you score points based on your clients &apos; weight , right ?
i &apos;m not doing that , ma &apos;am .
then what are you doing ?
he &apos;s lying .
the prosecutor can &apos;t add charges
just because you won &apos;t take a plea .
yeah .
hello . um , ms. brantley ,
okay , good news .
prosecutor &apos;s willing to play ball-- probation , one year .
no . you &apos;re fired .
i want her .
this is nothing more than a ploy , your honor .
this case should be tried in oregon , your honor ,
where my clients have their practices .
but alexa banner &apos;s
suicide took place here in illinois ,
where physician @-@ assisted suicide is still illegal .
mr. canning , are you okay ?
yeah , i @-@ i ... i will be in a second . i just have to get ...
your honor , um , mr. canning
knows that an oregon jury
will be more sympathetic to his case .
this court ... how many ?
i got it .
these doctors knew
that the victim was bringing drugs
to chicago in order to kill herself .
the trial should take place here .
i &apos;m agreeing with ms. lockhart on this one , mr. canning .
diane , why are you doing this ?
you &apos;re fighting for a cause you fundamentally don &apos;t believe in .
because you make me angry .
mr. dipple has been very pleased
with the work you &apos;ve been doing these last few months .
so , keep it up ... but keep the billable hours down .
we &apos;re happy to have you here , mr. carver .
is there anything else we can do for you ?
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re aware the illinois general assembly
is considering the physician- assisted suicide act .
yes . the medical coalition of illinois
recently dropped their objections .
that &apos;s a game @-@ changer .
and like california ,
it gives the governor a path to approving it .
i understand you know the governor &apos;s wife ,
alicia florrick .
you want us to talk to her ?
blocking physician @-@ assisted suicide is an issue
mr. dipple feels in his gut .
he wants to fight this on every front possible .
alicia doesn &apos;t work here anymore because
mr. dipple didn &apos;t want her here .
but let us see what we can do .
you &apos;re screwing me out of my fee .
you &apos;re trying to sabotage me so you can take the day .
you really think i care that much about your little game ?
she was about to take the deal
till you stuck your nose in it .
what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s trying to screw me out of my $ 135 .
no , your client is ...
alicia , professional courtesy .
we don &apos;t undercut each other , we don &apos;t snake each other &apos;s fees .
the florricks apparently do .
need an election , just steal it .
go to hell , bernie .
no .
you want her and her 120 pounds so much , fine . go for it .
130 to 140 ...
come on , female 42 . retail theft
in the amount of $ 899 . what &apos;s the offer ?
one year probation .
good . defense ?
uh , your honor , unfortunately my client cannot allocute .
why ?
it &apos;s a good offer , judge ,
she stole a $ 899 sweater .
he &apos;s right , ma &apos;am .
your record could be sealed six months after probation .
but i didn &apos;t steal anything .
approach , counselors .
sweeten the deal , matan . now . it &apos;s her first arrest .
i could live with six months . but that &apos;s my basement .
there . he did his part .
my client won &apos;t take it .
then do your damn job
and sell it to her .
and don &apos;t you dare slow me down , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;ll recall you in a minute . female 44,
retail theft of $ 71 .
i can probably get her to take six months
with a reducer to a misdemeanor .
no , i did my caving .
i need a guilty plea .
the prosecution is willing to take it down to six months probation ,
but you &apos;ll need to plead guilty .
but all i did was return a sweater .
this is ...
i &apos;m not admitting to anything .
maia , listen to me . you won &apos;t serve one hour in jail .
but it &apos;ll be on my record .
for six months , and then you can have it sealed .
female 42 . recalled .
so , we , uh , closing this out ?
my client pleads not guilty .
seriously ? he offered you six months . six .
yes , but she cannot plead ...
up here , mrs. florrick .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , i tried .
give the rest of your defendant sheets
to the sheriff . they &apos;re being distributed .
what ? why ?
i know you get paid by the case .
call it quid pro quo for the time
you &apos;re costing this court .
your honor ...
you can sit on that pew with your precious client
until preliminary hearings , for all i care .
female 65 . retail theft in the amount of $ 93 .
your honor , this is unfair .
ma &apos;am , when did you think bond court was about being fair ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m being taxed .
remember me ?
hope i &apos;m not interrupting .
no , not at all . eli and i were just
going over the campaign scheduling .
i like your office .
can &apos;t help but think of when we started the firm here .
so ... i came to ask if you &apos;d lobby peter on a bill .
it &apos;s called the physician @-@ assisted suicide act .
it &apos;ll hit peter &apos;s desk in a week or so .
and you want me to persuade him to sign it ?
no . veto it .
really ? why is that ?
you wanted to return to the firm .
this could be your ticket back .
i don &apos;t understand .
well , reese dipple is the reason you &apos;re not at the firm .
you sway peter on this bill ,
and dipple will sprinkle rose petals
as you step off the elevator .
no .
i &apos;m happy here , cary .
i like what i &apos;m doing .
it &apos;s not a lot of money .
i know .
anyway , i ask for something from peter ,
he asks for something back .
and i don &apos;t want to be asked for anything .
especially not physician @-@ assisted suicide .
no mother should have to watch
their child go through what alexa did .
i just wish she could have held on a little longer .
but isn &apos;t that selfish ?
why make her hold on if she was in so much pain ?
why not let her go ?
if she were terminal ,
i could have let her go , but she wasn &apos;t .
objection , your honor ,
um , the witness is @-@ is not a medical expert .
um , my clients can speak to alexa &apos;s ...
you &apos;d be surprised what kind of expert you can become
when your child gets brain cancer .
uh , ma &apos;am , please . let me rule on the objections .
overruled .
mrs. banner , the doctors here at the defense table said that
your daughter was terminal .
they were wrong .
a week before they prescribed those suicide drugs ,
duke university announced a new treatment for glioblastoma tumors .
let me help you with those , mr. canning .
and what was that treatment ?
the polio virus .
it &apos;s introduced into the tumorous brain cells
so it won &apos;t reproduce in the healthy ones .
it destroys the tumor .
and if your daughter had been told
that there was hope in this treatment ?
she &apos;d still be here .
would you like to take a minute , mrs. banner ?
no .
if i knew about this treatment , why didn &apos;t they ?
why did they give her drugs to kill herself
instead of giving her hope ?
that &apos;s not what doctors are supposed to do .
mr. crouse .
mrs. florrick .
you could &apos;ve knocked . my daughter &apos;s home .
didn &apos;t want to .
i thought you found another investigator .
i felt rejected .
well ... we were broke .
ah , so you found a rich client now ?
we found a client .
she &apos;s willing to pay for three hours of an investigator .
really ? how extravagant . starting now ?
she &apos;s telling the truth .
i bought the sweater for my daughter , for her birthday .
and do you have the receipt ?
no , i think i threw it away .
do you know what day you bought it , ma &apos;am ?
sunday before her birthday .
august 16 .
did you pay cash or credit card ?
cash .
always cash .
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s not good .
it just makes it more difficult
for us to prove that you bought it .
you &apos;re not covering for your daughter , are you , mrs. sachs ?
no . have you ever shopped at the store ? at salvatori &apos;s ?
no , ma &apos;am .
i have , a few times . why ?
they don &apos;t want me to shop there .
they tend to make it difficult for you .
not for you , but for us .
are you saying your daughter was targeted because of her race ?
yes . actually , i am saying that .
my daughter is no thief .
okay .
let me see what i can find out .
so this is your new office ?
yes , jackie .
it &apos;s not as big as it once was .
that &apos;s right .
and you &apos;re dressing up more ?
no , these are my usual clothes .
are you sure ?
i don &apos;t remember you showing so much cleavage .
and you had a haircut . it &apos;s very different .
yes .
many changes . a world in transition .
what is it you need from me , mr. gold ?
peter is being pressured to take a stance on a bill
legalizing physician @-@ assisted suicide .
what ? what stance ?
against it .
against physician @-@ assisted suicide ?
yes .
but he doesn &apos;t believe that .
that &apos;s probably true , but ...
the catholic
and conservative lobbies have his ear .
he &apos;d probably want to hear from you .
a concerned member of the family .
but ... only if you have the time .
i could make time .
he has a new campaign manager now .
ruth eastman .
she likes to limit access to peter ,
but just you tell her you &apos;re his mother ,
and i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll make an allowance .
judge , four different times before , they found a client of yours guilty .
which prevents me from mounting a proper defense .
you know they &apos;re playing games .
objection .
it &apos;s a perfectly reasonable request , your honor .
requests , plural .
she &apos;s asking for both the sku from the sweater
this is for a lousy ...
what is a sku ?
a stock @-@ keeping unit , your honor .
it &apos;s an electronic identifier attached to every sales item
to keep it from being stolen .
oh , god .
get up here , mrs. florrick .
no , not you .
this is not to kill a mockingbird .
this is not anatomy of a murder .
this is a constitutionally mandated necessity .
it is lucille ball wrapping chocolates
on an assembly line .
cases get processed , justice is served for the greater whole .
not for you , not for her .
for all people .
and i will be damned if i will allow you to gum it up .
motion denied . step the hell back .
then we request a continuance , your honor .
preliminary hearings are for the prosecution .
are you ready to proceed , mr. brody ?
100 % .
then call your first witness .
your honor , this is wholly unfair .
damn straight , marie antoinette .
because every other defendant in this room
and in that hallway isn &apos;t gonna see their kids tonight ,
thanks to you .
now step back .
you &apos;re on , mr. brody .
you have glioblastoma multiforme , is that correct ?
i had it . past tense .
so your tumor-- the exact type that alexa banner had-- is gone ?
yeah .
thanks to the duke polio trial , i am cancer @-@ free .
elvis has left the building .
and when you were ill , did you contemplate suicide ?
every day for about a year .
i didn &apos;t want to go on .
but then you found hope ?
objection , your honor . counsel is testifying .
withdrawn .
mr. linklater ,
would you consider yourself a medical miracle ?
objection ,
miracles have no basis in fact .
really ? i saw the &apos; 69 mets .
how about a recess , your honor ?
what are you offering , mr. canning ?
$ 1 million , no admission of liability ,
and , uh , a gag order .
okay . i will take that to our client .
are you willing to drop the gag order ?
no , that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s non @-@ negotiable .
then you can expect a no .
dipple must be paying you one hell of a retainer .
that &apos;s a good offer i made you in there .
and our clients will hear it .
this is such a farce .
i mean , you of all people
support physician @-@ assisted suicide , diane .
when did you go mercenary ?
and who &apos;s paying your bills , louis ?
you win , more people kill themselves ,
and the insurance companies save billions on hospital expenses .
yeah , sure , i &apos;m an insurance company shill .
but they happen to be on the right side of this issue .
i &apos;m not gonna take lessons in hypocrisy from you .
carver and dipple don &apos;t care about your clients .
they just want to raise malpractice rates .
intimidate doctors out of helping people die .
talk to your clients .
see how much they really care about gag orders .
mr. gold , hi .
oh , my mom &apos;s not here .
that &apos;s okay ,
i just came to drop something off for her .
this week &apos;s invitations .
women &apos;s group meetings all over iowa ,
bar functions .
any command performances ?
they &apos;re tabbed red , yellow , and green .
oh . thanks .
actually , grace , do you have a minute ?
sure , what &apos;s up ?
what do you think about physician @-@ assisted suicide ?
why ?
you &apos;re still ...
christian , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m still christian .
well , i think your dad might need some advice
from someone who is against physician @-@ assisted suicide .
edward waller .
i &apos;m a security officer at salvatori &apos;s department store .
and before that , you served as a specialist in the u.s. army ,
training soldiers in iraq ?
objection . relevance .
oh , dear god . are you serious ?
overruled .
overruled . continue .
i worked at al asad air base ,
anbar province for two years .
mr. waller , this is the report
you filed on the theft by maia sachs .
does this accurately describe
the events of this past tuesday ?
sure does . we see this ruse every day .
customer walks in
with an empty salvatori bag .
they rip the tags off some item ,
drop the item in the bag ,
and pretend to return it for cash .
thank you .
mr. waller ...
we &apos;re done here , mrs. florrick .
i ... excuse me ?
we &apos;re done here . you can cross tomorrow .
factory whistle &apos;s blown .
your honor , my @-@ my cross will only take a few minutes .
mrs. sachs , you &apos;ll be spending the night
in the cook county jail unless you choose to plead ...
your honor , this is ... this is blackmail .
plead or jail , mrs. sachs ?
i &apos;m not pleading .
fine .
henry , would you please escort
mrs. sachs to the cook county jail ?
hang in there , maia . it &apos;ll be okay .
and if it &apos;s not okay , mrs. sachs ,
you can blame your attorney .
alicia , it &apos;s jason .
you ever argue a case against racial profiling ?
i &apos;m optimistic .
wind &apos;s blowing our way .
is this a trojan horse ?
reese , may i call you back ?
trojan horse ?
to raise malpractice insurance .
to make sure no doctor ever helps a dying patient
end his or her life ?
yes , of course . that &apos;s a secondary purpose .
so this is the first of many suits ?
doctors are rarely moved by ethical arguments against euthanasia .
but they do understand money .
rising malpractice rates tend to sharpen the mind .
do you know any terminally ill people , mr. carver ?
i mean gravely ill and in constant pain ?
yes .
and you don &apos;t think that person
has the right to end his or her life ?
i don &apos;t think doctors should be in the business of killing ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
i know it &apos;s a strange concept .
but i don &apos;t like when categories get confused .
when a fireman starts fires
instead of putting them out .
fahrenheit 451 .
i thought you &apos;d appreciate that .
so you &apos;re fine with civilian volunteers
helping people die instead of doctors ?
no . but at least it would take
the veneer of medicine away from it .
i don &apos;t understand you people .
we people ?
you want to get government off our backs
until it comes to issues like abortion and euthanasia .
a perfectly healthy woman was allowed to kill herself
at an assisted dying clinic in basel .
she wasn &apos;t terminal , she wasn &apos;t sick .
her only rationale was ...
she was afraid of getting old .
and losing control .
doctors killed
1,807 people last year in belgium .
some only suffering from depression .
yes , and if this were belgium , we would have something to argue
dominoes fall fast in this country .
just ask gay couples getting married in alabama .
ouch . ouch , my head is hurting from the wrongness here .
you ask anyone
who survives a jump from the golden gate bridge
what their last thought is ...
you &apos;ve done a lot of that , have you ?
it &apos;s always this : what a stupid mistake i just made .
and that &apos;s why you would take away their choice ?
i don &apos;t think this country should make it easier for people to die .
not even the terminally ill ?
we should make it easier to manage pain . that should be the goal .
why not both ?
do you want off this case ?
no .
but i want it to be about this case
and not every case .
okay .
raptor is on @-@ site .
it &apos;s mrs. florrick .
copy that . i &apos;ve got eyes on raptor .
hello , mrs. florrick .
mrs. florrick , hello .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met . i &apos;m ruth eastman ,
your son &apos;s campaign manager .
oh , i love that purse . it &apos;s very attractive .
thank you . i need to speak to my son .
oh , he &apos;s in a meeting right now . why don &apos;t we talk for a minute ?
i was just pouring some tea .
i &apos;d love to . and maybe after i speak to my son .
actually , i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s our standing staff meeting .
every tuesday , come hell or high water .
peter ?
unfortunately , that won &apos;t work .
our aides are instructed :
no interruptions , no exceptions .
just give &apos; em 20 minutes . come on .
why don &apos;t we get better acquainted in here ?
oh , excuse me . um ...
excuse me . let me answer this , and we &apos;ll talk .
it &apos;ll just be a minute .
hello .
yes , i prescribed ten grams of pentobarbital liquid to alexa .
and what steps did you take before prescribing it ?
i examined alexa and determined she had a terminal illness
that would likely cause death within six months .
and , of course , i talked to her .
about what ?
whether this was voluntary .
whether it was what she wanted . if she was depressed .
sounds thorough .
i try to be .
the law requires we discuss every danger
and issue before we prescribe .
but more than that , i thought it was my responsibility .
thank you .
dr. brinton , the law also says
that patients need to be advised of their alternatives .
did you tell alexa about the duke study ?
that &apos;s not what the law means . it means like hospice care .
so you didn &apos;t tell her about the duke study ?
no .
but you knew about it ?
i knew it was in its early stages , but the odds
of success were very low . at best , one in 20 .
i didn &apos;t want to give her false hope .
false hope ?
yes .
patients look for any scrap of good news from a doctor .
but there was good news , wasn &apos;t there ?
not in my opinion .
don &apos;t you think the person
who should have been making that ultimate call
was alexa and not you ?
objection .
badgering .
pointed , yes . badgering , no . overruled .
she did make the ultimate call .
yes , but not with all of the information .
it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference .
you don &apos;t know that .
i looked at the arrest records out of the department store .
it &apos;s almost all african @-@ americans .
there &apos;s a racist security guard ?
or a spotter .
what &apos;s a spotter ?
it &apos;s an undercover shopper
who keeps an eye out for shoplifters .
it &apos;s also possible the spotters
are targeting african @-@ americans just to ...
keep &apos; em away . it &apos;s like the new york stores last year .
couple of &apos; em settled
an attorney general &apos;s investigation ...
what ?
that &apos;s her .
that &apos;s one of the ones they targeted .
the goal is to get you out of here .
so your best move is to plea and pay your fine .
but i didn &apos;t steal anything .
ms. todd ...
betty , you &apos;ll make your life a lot easier if you do what i say .
let me talk to the prosecutor , plead it out .
don &apos;t plead her out .
what ?
why ?
female 62 .
i @-@ i need 30 seconds with matan on this one , your honor .
you get 20 .
salvatori &apos;s , the department store ,
it &apos;s targeting african @-@ americans .
she didn &apos;t do it .
uh @-@ uh , alicia . this isn &apos;t your case .
back the hell off .
but i have a witness who can testify .
i don &apos;t care . you &apos;re slowing things down .
can i change attorneys ?
mom . i didn &apos;t know you were coming in .
i didn &apos;t realize i needed an appointment .
of course you don &apos;t . no , please , sit , sit .
i &apos;d rather stand , peter . it &apos;s hard enough to ...
uh , i came here
intending to discuss an issue of real importance to me ,
but now , uh ...
well , your campaign manager ,
ms. eastman , is not serving you well .
and she &apos;s disrespecting me .
now , whether you were state &apos;s attorney or governor ,
i still always had access to you .
but now , with this presidential run ...
nothing &apos;s changed , mom .
... suddenly there &apos;s a palace guard
wearing a pantsuit and cheap shoes ,
and she showed no remorse ...
mom , i think maybe ...
no , peter ,
listen to me .
she needs to get her priorities straight ,
or you need to dismiss her .
okay , i will talk to ruth .
do you want to now discuss this issue of importance with me ?
no , i ... i can &apos;t . not in this state .
we &apos;ll have to talk about it another time .
okay .
just so you know , i have to go back to iowa ...
oh , mrs. florrick , hi again ...
i just wanted to let you know that your daughter stopped by ,
wanting to talk to you about the physician @-@ assisted suicide bill .
but i handled it .
you what ?
what do you mean you handled it ?
first , you come between a mother and her son ,
and now you feel comfortable coming
between a son and his daughter ?
oh , no , no , no . that &apos;s not what i mean .
is that why your wife wanted to end her life ,
because of the pain ?
yes .
she was afraid she was losing control over her life .
ms. lockhart has spoken a lot about
this duke brain tumor study .
would that have changed alexa &apos;s mind
if she knew about it ?
objection .
calls for speculation .
goes to state of mind , your honor .
overruled .
alexa was beyond hope .
she said she wanted to go out on her own terms .
thank you .
thank you for coming today .
and , mr. crouse , can you please describe what you witnessed ?
ms. todd being followed by a spotter
and arrested , despite the fact she didn &apos;t steal anything .
thank you .
mr. crouse , were you disbarred as a lawyer six years ago ?
i was .
because you punched a judge
after he found a client of yours guilty .
objection . relevance .
overruled . let &apos;s keep this moving .
yes .
and were you not investigated by the bar
four different times before then for altering evidence ,
objection !
all in an effort to prove
your clients were innocent ?
this is beyond the pale .
it &apos;s character assassination 101 .
i don &apos;t care .
overruled .
why should we believe
your account of what happened to ms. todd ?
objection .
mr. crouse &apos;s background has no bearing
on what he witnessed .
and yet in my mind , it does .
why should you believe my account ?
because i &apos;m telling the truth .
of course you are .
no , no , i &apos;m your lawyer .
you can &apos;t change lawyers now .
i don &apos;t want you . i want that lady .
yeah . you should be doing what she is .
look , i don &apos;t care what mrs. florrick is doing .
the best way to get out is to plead .
sure . if that &apos;s what you want .
congratulations .
you &apos;ve just stolen another client .
no , i didn &apos;t ... i wasn &apos;t ...
grace , if you believe in the sanctity of life ...
it &apos;s not a choice , grandma .
that &apos;s what the bible commands .
i went to sunday school , dear .
all right , i think what grandma &apos;s trying to say ,
grace , is that , when it come to euthanasia ,
there is possibly a broader imperative .
i can speak for myself , thank you .
grace , all religions preach respect
for every human being .
which means respecting their choices ,
including those about end of life .
but if there &apos;s a higher authority ...
then he wouldn &apos;t want someone with end @-@ stage ovarian cancer
to go on suffering .
governor , your wife is on the line .
grace , on this issue i understand that ...
alicia , hi .
veronica . hello .
they told me that ...
no , but then , all of a sudden ,
if we start-- if that &apos;s something that we have to decide ...
uh , well , i appreciate it , but i already have
all the research on the physician @-@ assisted suicide bill .
we &apos;re talking about the doctors .
oh , well , i have to go , veronica ,
but i will tell alicia that we talked . thanks .
what the hell &apos;s going on today ?
when one family member shows up , it &apos;s a surprise .
when two do , it &apos;s a coincidence .
when three show up , it &apos;s eli .
he &apos;s messing with me , governor .
i don &apos;t care .
do you hear me ? i don &apos;t give a damn .
your little skirmishes are not my problem .
i am running for the most powerful office in the world .
i need you to fix this , and i need you to fix this right now .
it &apos;s never been our choice .
one of our people found it .
they must have dug pretty deep for this .
anything to help the cause , ms. lockhart .
who is karen casavant ?
mr. stoke ?
she &apos;s my friend .
your girlfriend ?
objection .
relevance .
goes to bias , your honor .
overruled .
when did you start seeing
ms. casavant , sir ?
seven months ago .
so a month before alexa committed suicide ?
sorry to scare you , honey .
no , it &apos;s fine . just ...
there are actually over 60 different bible verses
that make it clear how precious life is .
genesis 2 : 7 . acts 17 : 25 .
lutheran church of hope , born and raised .
i know where you &apos;re coming from .
my nephew andrew just joined
the marines right out of high school .
he could have been going to an ivy league college .
instead , he &apos;ll be doing push @-@ ups in the mud on paris island .
but it &apos;s what he needs right now .
an ordering principle for his life .
something to believe in .
i ... i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
your granddaughter grace .
if they &apos;re not idealistic at that age ,
when can they be ?
you &apos;re always gonna have your dad &apos;s ear , grace .
and i promise you , you &apos;re always going to have mine , too .
we need you on this campaign .
you &apos;re always going to have your boy &apos;s ear , mrs. florrick .
and i promise you you &apos;re always gonna have mine , too .
i &apos;m realizing we need you on this campaign .
yes . thank you .
and i &apos;ll tell you something for nothing .
the smartest men listen to their women .
and the smartest women ...
are those with more than a little experience .
am i right ?
this is a list of the clients i &apos;m representing ,
all of whom were arrested for theft at your store .
you &apos;ll notice that a disproportionate number are african @-@ americans .
this is the kind of thing the sun @-@ times eats up ,
especially when there &apos;s rumblings of a class action .
on the other hand , if i could see some security tape ...
the only thing more boring than watching security footage is nothing .
it &apos;s the best viewing in the world .
this gives you real insight into human character .
so you beat up a judge ?
i hit a judge .
i wanted to beat up a judge ,
but i got tackled after the first punch .
hmm . anger issues , maybe ?
i am the calmest , sweetest man
on the face of the earth .
but there are times ...
and there are people
that sometimes just don &apos;t listen to reason .
do i need to worry about you ?
yeah .
seriously , now .
why do you think you got me so cheap ?
there &apos;s your client .
where is she going , the register ?
hard to tell from here .
let &apos;s try a different angle .
2015年9月12日 下午4点
well , that &apos;s unfortunate-- we can &apos;t see what she &apos;s doing .
wha @-@ what are you doing ?
2015年8月16日
the day the mom bought the sweater .
2015年8月16日 下午两点
smart .
that &apos;s her .
not what i expected .
i don &apos;t believe this .
the only way to get you off
is to show this video to the judge .
and she gets hauled into court ?
and that judge calls her number in front of all those people .
yes .
i &apos;ll take the plea .
what &apos;s next ?
just closing statements and crossing of fingers .
i trust in good arguments ,
not magical happenings .
what ?
why is he back here ?
did your wife have an account
on the web site scabbit ?
yes .
can you see that okay ?
let &apos;s look at this posting she made may 12 .
can you read that ?
&quot; garbage . &quot;
&quot; garbage &quot; with an exclamation point .
now let &apos;s just scroll up and see
what thread she was responding to .
为小儿麻痹治疗提供希望
now , you see that ? can you read that ?
&quot; duke university brain tumor center
offers hope for polio cure &quot;
so alexa did know
about the potential treatment and still made the decision
that the slim chance of success wasn &apos;t worth it .
ruth . come in .
oh . i don &apos;t want to interrupt you , eli .
i just wanted to say thank you .
i know you were trying to make my life hell
by siccing all those florricks on me . but you know what ?
we worked through it .
and it wound up bringing me a lot closer to jackie and grace .
so thank you .
and just remember ...
i &apos;m good at what i do .
you want to get me ,
you &apos;ll have to bring your &quot; a &quot; game .
open or closed ?
or i guess it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s really not as bad as you think .
you came in second in perps by the pound .
all the bar attorneys think i &apos;m a slimy bitch
who poached their clients .
who cares about them ?
i also gave up a possible class action suit
for some video footage i couldn &apos;t use .
the way i see it , you have two problems .
one-- you spend too much time on your cases .
which is why you &apos;ll always be a disaster in bond court .
and two ...
nope .
one problem .
what were you gonna say ?
no . you &apos;ll wear it as a badge of honor .
oh , come on . now you have to say .
you care too much .
there .
how &apos;s that ? happy ?
not really .
there &apos;s no glory in this slog , alicia .
shake the trees for better @-@ paying cases .
what ?
want to do it together ?
