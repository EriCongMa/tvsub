the &apos; 80s was the decade of great dance movies ,
but nothing had the moves or magic
of the epic love story &quot; dirty dancing . &quot;
and no one loved it more than beverly goldberg .
somebody who &apos;s taught me ...
... that there are people willing to stand up for other people
no matter what it costs them .
sit down , jake .
unfortunately , my mom dragged me to see it with her ...
17 times .
you said we could see &quot; spaceballs . &quot;
there &apos;s no space or balls in this whole movie .
hold my hand . live this with me .
my mom was so obsessed ,
she even bought a copy for the low price of $ 89.99 .
nobody puts baby in a corner .
nobody !
my god , his arms are like glistening tree trunks .
and -- woof -- mama like that mullet .
&quot; dirty dancing &quot; was the only thing
that got my mom and sister to get along .
for the first time ever , they were , like , friends .
you know , this is actually based on a true story .
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s real , and you can &apos;t take that away from me .
wait ... maybe it can be !
the sucky losers on the school dance committee
are still fighting over a theme .
we can do a &quot; dirty dancing &quot; dance !
are you telling me you get to live &quot; dirty dancing , &quot;
and i could live every moment through you ?
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying at all .
it &apos;s decided . we do this dance .
aw , screw it ! help me plan it .
lame !
sorry , ladies .
truth bomb coming in !
this one gonna hurt !
&quot; dirty dancing &quot; sucks !
no ! don &apos;t you ruin this for us !
there &apos;s only one dance movie in this world that matters --
&quot; footloose &quot; !
go away !
stop this at once !
it has it all -- gymnastics ,
bros bonding secretly with dance ,
and a ruggedly handsome outsider
who dances into the hearts of a small town .
please !
&quot; dirty dancing &quot; is at least realistic .
a beautiful girl dances into the hearts of a small resort .
no . patrick swayze can only be a badass roadhouse bouncer ,
not some tight @-@ pants @-@ wearing mountain dancer .
you are grounded for six weeks !
no tv or phone !
but i need the phone to talk
and the tv to watch television !
that &apos;s the point .
fine ! you take away my &quot; footloose , &quot;
i take away your &quot; dirty dancing . &quot;
what ?
no !
no !
hands off my swayze !
he &apos;s a bouncer ! no !
dancer !
he is a bouncer !
he &apos;s a bouncer !
dancer !
dancer !
he &apos;s a bouncer !
dancer !
it was march 2nd , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my mom had one simple request of my dad .
murray , there &apos;s something wrong with the wheels on this vacuum cleaner .
can you come down and take a look at it ?
i just bought you a new used one nine years ago !
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s sticking .
see , if you just move it back and forth , you know ?
seems fine to me .
just move with it a little .
just , uh , take a few steps forward
and a few steps back .
there it goes .
just really get into the rhythm of the vacuum .
oh @-@ ho @-@ ho , no !
i see what you &apos;re doing . i am not dancing with you .
damn it !
i was inches away from having the time of my life .
inches !
that was a close one , huh ?
you mean , how you almost gave your wife the one thing
she &apos;s desperately wanted for the last 25 years ?
the nerve of some people .
see ? you get it . why doesn &apos;t she ?
murray , it &apos;s important to her .
it &apos;s just dancing . what &apos;s the big deal ?
for one thing , i literally
have never danced a day in my life .
and based upon my current energy level ,
not gonna start soon .
oh , stop .
everyone &apos;s danced at some point .
yeahhhh , not me .
you &apos;ve never been in the shower and hummed a few bars ?
i &apos;m all business in the shower .
soap , rinse , out .
you &apos;ve never once been driving ,
and miami sound machine comes on
and you tap your finger on the wheel ?
tap my finger ? who am i , gregory hines ?
are you trying to say that even as a little boy ,
you never once clapped your hands to the radio ?
my dad traded it for a bucket .
that &apos;s how i got my birthday bucket .
this is a nightmare !
and you &apos;re to blame .
true .
and it &apos;s going to be the first school dance
ever worth going to .
no . when will this &quot; dirty dancing &quot; oppression end ? !
when will everybody cut loose , footloose ,
lick off your sundae spoons ? !
sweetie , i keep telling you , the song is not about ice cream .
you don &apos;t know ! no one does !
hey , pretty pretty .
guess you &apos;re gonna be looking
for a partner to practice those sensual moves with .
and it &apos;s not going to be you .
come on , i know every single move that swayze does in that movie .
seriously ?
ah , good for you .
actually , i &apos;ve never seen it , but i will now ,
and i will dedicate my life
to becoming your own personal swayze .
you go full swayze ,
maybe i &apos;ll let you dance near me .
proximity dance ! it &apos;s a deal !
yeah . no deal .
there is no way &quot; dirty dancing &quot;
will ever be a theme at a school @-@ sanctioned dance .
give me one good reason !
it &apos;s literally got &quot; dirty &quot; in the title ,
not to mention it &apos;s wildly inappropriate .
inappropriate ? !
&quot; wildly inappropriate . &quot;
that piece of human
doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s inappropriate for children .
he said the theme &apos;s gonna be &quot; soda pop hop . &quot;
it &apos;s over , mom .
over ?
did johnny castle give up
when he was unjustly fired from kellerman &apos;s ?
no , he did not .
that &apos;s right !
he came back and danced dirty ,
and so will you after i march down to that school
and give principal ball a piece of my mind .
no . let me march .
you want to march ?
i do .
down there ? !
yes !
to demand unrealistic changes to school policy ,
with a complete disdain for reason and common sense ?
i learned from the best .
i &apos;ve never been prouder to call you my daughter .
and i &apos;ve never been proud to be your daughter until now .
and so , for the first time ,
erica goldberg marched down to school
and channeled beverly goldberg .
and if you still say no ,
i &apos;ll go above your shiny head to the pta .
no , the school board .
no , the secretary of education .
so , what do you and your coffee @-@ stained tie have to say to that ?
a month &apos;s detention .
what ? !
that &apos;s not how this is supposed to work !
the thing is , i &apos;m an adult ,
and the way you &apos;re speaking to me is completely unacceptable .
but i &apos;m a goldberg . this is what we do .
and fortunately for both of us , you &apos;re not your mother
and she &apos;s not here right now .
but ... i think we could compromise
on something besides a dirty dance .
a compromise , huh ?
okay , door &apos;s always open ,
but no more steamrolling me !
i want your respect . understand ?
uh , i &apos;m not following .
thank goodness that &apos;s over .
as erica was channeling my mom at school ,
my dad was being schooled by pops .
ah , murray , perfect timing .
come over here , take a seat .
i want you to look at that handsome young man
and tell me what you see .
someone who was still able to drop his pants in peace .
no !
this is a photo of your first dance ,
your first act as a married man ,
and you &apos;re not even moving .
i moved plenty that day .
i walked down the aisle , i stepped on the glass ,
i walked back up the aisle .
i was a regular carl lewis .
damn it , murray , when you asked for my daughter &apos;s hand ,
you said you &apos;d do everything you could to make her happy .
does that look like happiness to you ?
fine !
i &apos;ll do one dance , but i &apos;m not moving my lower half .
did someone say &quot; dance instructor &quot; ?
no ! where did you even come from ? !
come on ! it &apos;s like &quot; footloose &quot; !
you &apos;re the dopey farm boy , and i &apos;m kevin bacon !
let me be your bacon !
don &apos;t distract me with bacon .
i &apos;m not dancing .
come on !
yeah ! feel the beat !
there &apos;s nothing wrong with two bros bonding over dance .
barry , this is a delicate situation .
you &apos;re making it worse !
well , the infectious music of kenny loggins will win him over .
it &apos;s not winning him over .
the human body is literally programmed to love loggins .
he can &apos;t say no !
no !
what if i told you there was a way
that you could be a dancing god
without ever having to move your body ?
no ! don &apos;t listen to him !
i &apos;m listening .
all you got to do
is raise your hands over your head .
at the same time ?
yes .
you &apos;re gonna listen to this lazy @-@ eyed nerd
when you have this at your disposal ?
i &apos;m gonna go with adam &apos;s easy thing .
okay , if you can pull this off with mom ,
you &apos;ll never have to dance again .
are you insane ? i can &apos;t do that !
and neither could ferris bueller &apos;s lame @-@ ass sister .
that is , until she learned how .
i &apos;m in a pool . i don &apos;t want to be in a pool .
in the movie , they were in a lake .
would you rather be in a lake ?
i &apos;d rather be in my chair !
put your hands up . i &apos;ll jump to you .
you catch me .
1 ... 2 ... 3 .
my soft @-@ belly meat !
i &apos;m cold . let &apos;s forget this .
this is your chance to make mom feel loved and delighted !
i &apos;m freezing and miserable !
don &apos;t you swim away from me !
what is that , a doggy paddle ?
you &apos;re a grown man !
while my dad &apos;s plan to dance sank ,
erica was ready to rise to the occasion .
mom , guess what ?
i actually got principal ball to say yes ,
so the dirty dance is back on .
well , that is very surprising to me , schmoop @-@ aloo !
i can &apos;t believe i did it .
uh , you ! you did it , not me .
i was here mopping .
the dance is back on ?
that means i can still swayze you .
let it go , jeff .
i &apos;m not gonna sensually gyrate with you .
i &apos;m sorry , &quot; gyrate &quot; ?
if i &apos;m gonna get dirty with anyone ,
it &apos;s gonna be marc mcgonagle .
marc mcgonagle ?
erica , i &apos;m begging you .
give me a chance to groove all up on you .
no . do not do that .
let our bodies speak without words .
stop ! nobody &apos;s body is speaking to any other bodies .
this is just a school dance .
dirty dance .
ugh , again with that awful movie .
think about it , dude .
the school is letting us dirty @-@ dance .
they want us to get freaky .
ladies &apos; man cogan bringing it dirty , y &apos;all !
that was not in the movie .
yeah , we never saw the movie ,
but the title says it all .
guys , if you &apos;re gonna dirty @-@ dance ,
at least do it right .
what have i done ?
florida .
yes .
after my dad &apos;s botched dance lesson ,
it seemed this was as close to &quot; dirty dancing &quot;
as he would get .
look at him . has to be special effects .
no man can lift a tiny lady like that .
you &apos;re finally watching that movie , huh ?
i know i promised i &apos;d take bevy out dancing ,
but i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;ll look stupid .
since when do you care about how you look ?
you spend half your life puttering around this house
in your underpants .
well , that &apos;s about comfort .
it &apos;s also a warning shot to outsiders
that you &apos;re not welcome .
all i &apos;m saying is , you always
care less about what other people think .
why is this different ?
let me be honest with you .
i don &apos;t like to move my body .
yeah , we &apos;ve met .
now , the thing is , i &apos;m afraid .
dancing in front of all those people with their judgy eyes --
i @-@ i can &apos;t do it .
well , you &apos;ll never know how you &apos;ll look if you don &apos;t try .
pops was right . my dad had to see for himself .
luckily , he spotted my trusty camera .
and , with no one around ,
he decided to give dancing a shot .
he grooved , he grinded ,
he gyrated ,
he did ... whatever this is .
look at me !
i &apos;m a guy who dances now !
he danced like no one was watching ,
and luckily , no one was .
just a reminder , i will be performing
with with my barbershop quartet , the princi @-@ pals ,
at the open mike thursday ...
* ni @-@ i @-@ ght *
stop the announcements . we need to talk .
no , no , no , no , no !
we had an agreement over stern eye contact
that if i gave in to your daughter &apos;s dance demands ,
you would stay far away from my office .
but that was before i realized that you were right
and there can be no dance .
but you forced me to flip @-@ flop !
i flipped ! i can &apos;t flop back !
i didn &apos;t know how dirty that dance was gonna be !
which is why i wanted it to be a soda pop hop !
it was my favorite dance as a teen ,
but no one &apos;s embraced it .
well , i &apos;m embracing it , earl .
fine ! the dirty dance is once again dead .
one thing -- my daughter , erica , must never know
that i had anything to do with this .
i think that &apos;s your mom !
yes , thank you , lainey !
you .
what &apos;s up , best friend who &apos;s also my daughter ?
the p.a. system was on the whole time .
the whole school heard every crazy word you said .
oopsie .
you completely betrayed me .
who does that ? !
a normal mama who loves you
and you love back ?
for once , i thought we were a team
and had something in common .
turns out , we never will .
as erica left my mom feeling low ,
my dad was still high on his sweet moves .
look at me go !
i have to admit , at first , i was a little bit nervous ,
but now look at me !
burn this .
i &apos;m sorry ?
this must never be seen by anyone .
i &apos;m not following .
if you love my daughter ,
you won &apos;t do any of this ever again .
you said i wouldn &apos;t know if i could dance until i tried .
well , you tried and now we know .
you cannot and should not dance .
look at this .
oh , no !
adam , no , turn away !
it &apos;ll change you forever !
oh , no , no , no ! what am i looking at ? !
turn away !
i want to , but i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s like the ark from &quot; raiders &quot; !
you promised you wouldn &apos;t judge me ,
but i &apos;m feeling a lot of judging right now .
don &apos;t make yourself the victim in this .
that boy is the victim .
all i did was walk into the room .
okay , i know you &apos;re super pissed at mom .
well , i got good news .
let my sanctuary heal you !
i come here to release my angry rage that i always have .
how ?
a little thing called ...
the angry dance .
that &apos;s not a thing .
tell that to kevin bacon &apos;s body double in &quot; footloose . &quot;
go on . angry @-@ dance !
unleash your pain with tumbles and flips !
you &apos;re an idiot .
i &apos;m trying to help you here .
the only thing you &apos;re doing is proving what a dope you are .
your words make me so angry !
dance it out , barry . dance it out .
now it &apos;s your turn . fight the power with dance !
okay , i will never do what you just did .
but you were right about one thing .
i can and will fight the power with dance .
since when do we need permission to dance dirty ?
we are gonna go to that dance and get dirty
whether principal ball likes it or not .
that &apos;s right . you can &apos;t stop this .
exactly , although never do that again .
the soda pop hop was in full effect .
it was less than thrilling .
the &apos; 50s suck .
to think i dressed up in my good rush shirt and everything .
thankfully for every kid in that gym ,
erica and her friends had other plans .
it &apos;s 21 : 00 .
operation &quot; dance my way into erica &apos;s heart &quot; is a go .
that is not the name !
it &apos;s way too long .
yep , erica was a girl on a mission --
make a squeaky @-@ clean dance a little more dirty .
baby has the watermelon .
roger .
10 @-@ 4 .
i love sharing secrets with you !
you &apos;re so loud .
way too loud .
i knew it .
hey , dude , some guy , like , barfed on your van .
what ? who ?
who ? uh ... me ?
i &apos;ll kill you !
it was a needlessly intricate plan
that was ready to rock &apos; n &apos; roll --
that is , until barry rolled up .
it &apos;s boom time !
stop ! i don &apos;t know what this is , but stop !
it &apos;s a confetti cannon .
now cut @-@ up paper will endlessly rain down on us
like in the final scene of &quot; footloose . &quot;
i told you --
this is &quot; dirty dancing , &quot; not &quot; footloose &quot; !
hello ? an authority figure
has banned us from moving our bodies .
seriously , erica , i pity you .
i pity you both .
there is no way i &apos;m letting you
ruin this wonderful soda pop hop !
both of you , out !
if i &apos;m going out , i &apos;m going out dirty !
hit it , lainey !
and just like that ,
my sister took a leap of faith .
no !
it &apos;s a dance about soda !
just like you practiced , dude . you can do this .
too fast !
slow down !
maybe too big .
ohhh , i just blew it .
and ... footloose !
tell me where she is ,
and i &apos;ll get the ball rolling by calling her a moron .
my office .
and it is thrilling
to finally be on the same page for once .
i &apos;m so sorry about all of this , earl .
i never should &apos;ve shown her that movie .
it &apos;s just too dirty for a child to handle .
i get it . i &apos;m a parent , too .
our job is to save these kids from themselves ,
even if it means crushing a dream or two .
good luck .
it turned out , my mom was living &quot; dirty dancing , &quot;
but she wasn &apos;t baby --
she was her controlling parent , jerry orbach ,
and that was a role she refused to play .
mom , i know i screwed up ...
humiliated myself .
got cake in my ear and inhaled some confetti .
and i &apos;m grounded for life , which i deserve .
no , you don &apos;t .
what ?
so , you wanted to live &quot; dirty dancing . &quot;
nobody gets that more than me .
i &apos;d love to be baby
get swept off my feet
and spun around the dance floor .
honestly , it &apos;s all i &apos;ve ever wanted .
i know it can &apos;t happen for me ,
but , uh , it still can for you .
what are you saying ?
nobody puts my baby in a corner .
and so , with the help of our mom ,
erica cleaned herself off and took center stage
to have the time of her life .
i think she gets that from me .
what in heaven &apos;s name is happening ?
i brought you here to shut this nonsense down ,
not make it worse !
the dirty dance is back on !
you might want to orbach these kids , but not me .
i miss the &apos; 50s .
just look at them . it &apos;s not even 9 : 30 .
hey , i know it &apos;s not &quot; footloose , &quot;
but will you just dance a little ?
for me ?
i &apos;ll do it ... but i won &apos;t like it .
sure , we didn &apos;t magically do the same dance number
like in the movies .
in fact , most of us weren &apos;t good dancers at all .
but for the first time , it didn &apos;t seem to matter .
i &apos;m really doing it !
i can &apos;t believe it , either !
my baby is baby !
um , that was something .
it was everything .
like you .
you talked and ruined it .
of course .
look at her go .
living her dream .
it &apos;s time you live yours , too .
come on .
in that moment ,
my mom wasn &apos;t just watching &quot; dirty dancing &quot;
for the 18th time .
she was living it for the very first .
it &apos;s all she ever wanted .
for one unforgettable night ,
everyone in that gym felt like jennifer grey .
we moved like swayze
and were as footloose as kevin bacon .
we all ruled that dance floor , and it was epic .
what &apos;s happening ? !
captain confetti strikes again !
hey , adam , feeling clean ?
what ?
did it go off ?
out .
