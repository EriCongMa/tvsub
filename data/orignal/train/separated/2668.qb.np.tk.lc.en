i don &apos;t want to minimize your position . two prior convictions .
you &apos;re in jeopardy of sentence under the habitual offenders statute .
i &apos;m paying you to hear shit that &apos;s eating my insides ?
peppers and eggs ?
peppers and eggs ? that &apos;s what i should &apos;ve had .
&quot; i &apos;d be happy to surrender mr. soprano .
you can be assured of my full cooperation . &quot;
you &apos;d rather they kicked in your front door at night ?
it &apos;s a target letter , corrado .
i got nowhere , so i asked them what your status was .

god , it &apos;s a fucking burn .
i &apos;m sick and tired of sitting around . i &apos;m gonna get out of here .
with your lady friend ?
what do you know about her ?
works for the joint fitters union , right ?
runs their labor management fund outside the feds &apos; oversight .

if you &apos;re smoking , you owe me $ 5 !
ally , what are you doing ?
ally ! oh , my god !
her parents split up .
so she &apos;s always at our house .
but she was born with a silver spoon .
teenagers are under a lot of stress .
i know this kid . she &apos;s great .
was it a genuine suicide attempt ? or was it a suicidal gesture ?
&quot; small cutting &quot; is the clinical term .
is &quot; large cutting &quot; o.j. in missing sweats ?
it &apos;s a cry for help .
her mother says she tried this before .
a couple times .
what else is going on ?
life is putting the prozac to the test .
it &apos;s all that business in the news ?
let &apos;s talk about my daughter .
principal says girls in sports do better .
they don &apos;t take drugs or get knocked up .
but now this shit .
if my daughter ever tried to kill herself ....
oh , god !
last week , i called you a whore .
i might &apos;ve been ...
... overstating the case a little bit .
mr. soprano .
miss sanfillipo .
a check for you to sign .
twenty grand ?
for research and development into furthering the art and science ...
... of metal joint fittings .
where does our research and development take us this time ?
well , i was thinking boca raton .
my , my ! you read my mind .
i &apos;m all packed .
i gotta talk to my cousin .
mr. soprano ?
what ?
i was waiting to talk to jerry about how i could use some room ...
... on this mall job i got in north bergen .
then i saw you here . and i thought , what the hell ...
... i may as well ask the man himself .
let &apos;s you and i meet . i can pass my recommends on to my cousin .
mama livia , how are you ?
do you remember me ? larry boy barese .
i know who you are .
you lit an apartment house on fire ...
... and scared your mother half to death .
mama &apos;s moving in here on the 15th .
yeah ? ooh , i like your shoes .
mama hasn &apos;t been well . last week she threw a jar of artichokes at me .
she better not throw any artichokes at me .
how are you doing ? remember larry ?
water under the bridge .
we &apos;re gonna take a walk .
you should get some shoes like his .
you &apos;ve always been a fucking genius . but this last move is the best .
the feds &apos;ll never surveil an old folks &apos; home .
that &apos;s why i got truckloads of bootleg polident coming in .
there he is .
how you doing ?
did you get your mother settled in yet ?
they &apos;re not sure they can accept her . they want to see my finances again .
so this office supply chain from virginia . what &apos;s the deal on them ?
i spoke to them . i think they &apos;ll listen to reason on minority hiring .
been to any games ?
what do they got ?
what the fuck ?
knees high , colgiavani !
eyes ahead ! energy , girls , energy !
i know we &apos;re all upset , but we still have a season left .
come on , let &apos;s go !
hey , coach .
fellas , sorry , but practice is closed today .
i &apos;m trying to keep the team focused .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re leaving us ? after two fucking years ?
i told that reporter to wait before he put that in the paper .
coach , look at my little girl out there .
you &apos;re breaking her heart !
believe me , art . i am hugely conflicted .
but rhode island doubled my salary !
they &apos;re giving my daughter a full ride ! what could i do ?
they made an offer i couldn &apos;t refuse .
you haven &apos;t heard ours .
come on .
look , i got a family too .
i have a daughter who loves playing soccer .
he &apos;s kidding about the offer .
hey , nobody blew a whistle !
let &apos;s not get lazy out here ! come on !
go fuck yourself .
excuse me ?
want me to tell your dad ?
it &apos;s my field .
give me 10 laps around the goals .
whatever .
make that 20 .
anybody else want to mouth off ?
good ! come on ! let &apos;s circle up for keep @-@ away .
let &apos;s go ! over here .
get in a big circle ! go ! move it !
i need some people out here . come on ! let &apos;s go !
give me your glass .
who &apos;d think we could be this contented ?
i did . as soon as i saw you , i knew .
you &apos;re a sweetheart .
if only they knew the other side of you .
they &apos;d eat me for breakfast .
i been looking at real estate . some nice houses on the market .
maybe you &apos;d like something bigger ?
no , corrado . this is our place .
you know how long we been coming here ?
sixteen years . and every one of them good .
how &apos;s junior , junior ?
he &apos;s catching some shuteye .
you &apos;re such a powerhouse .
when you kiss me down there ...
... you &apos;re like a great artist .
you got a real instinct for it .
pass me the red peppers .
you know the thrill you give ?
keep it to yourself , okay ?
yeah . all to myself .
corrado ?
yeah ?
why the big secret ?
about what ?
oral sex .
what &apos;s so terrible about pleasing a woman ?
you always have to talk about it .
well , i want to know why !
it &apos;s complicated .
yeah . but why ?
why ?
they think if you suck pussy , you &apos;ll suck anything .
you &apos;re kidding .
it &apos;s a sign of weakness . and possibly a sign that you &apos;re a finocchio .
a fag ?
that &apos;s ridiculous .
how would the two even translate ?
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t make the rules .
it &apos;s no big lifestyle choice .
my aunts quintima and jemma , they got money out earning on the street .
it &apos;s like being a banker . you help people .
chiara cried when she heard the coach was leaving .
you don &apos;t want to talk . fine .
i gotta pick up carmela anyway .
let me ask you a question : why does your wife hate me ?
charmaine doesn &apos;t hate you .
you lie like i play a horn .
what ?
look at this facchino . wearing a cap in a nice restaurant .
i hated that most when i had my restaurant . it &apos;s values today .
standards are crumbling .
would it kill this coach to stay until my kid graduates ?
then let him stay four years for chiara .
that burns my ass .
where you going ?
take your hat off .
excuse me ?
they don &apos;t sell hot dogs . they took the bleachers out .
i &apos;ll wear it where i want .
how you doing ?
thank you .

i had a long talk with coach hauser and ....
i &apos;m gonna play . that &apos;s all .
i told her she didn &apos;t have to .
she just said she wanted to .
yeah .
coach pressure you ?
no , mrs. soprano .
he would never do that .
pressure her ? he doesn &apos;t finish what he started .
dad !
what ?
it &apos;s what we all wanted .
okay . right ?
as long as everything &apos;s ....
we &apos;re trying to watch this , okay ?
kick ass , girls , right ?
good night .
listen , roberta , what i said earlier ?
i &apos;m serious , you discuss that with anyone , we &apos;re gonna go 10 rounds .
we just skimmed 20,000 off the development fund ...
... and you &apos;re worried about a little lecca fica ?
will you keep it down ?
all right .
i &apos;ll tell everyone you &apos;re a good kisser . i just won &apos;t say where .
that &apos;s my reputation you &apos;re playing with .
honey , my lips are sealed .
not too sealed , right ?

i will not be threatened or bribed !
i go where i want to when i want to !
hey !
all day , every day , 85 and not one drop of rain .
and those nights .
bobbi , you are so lucky with this guy . you have no idea .
he &apos;s a sweetheart underneath it all .
i wish i could get lou to be like him .
more sensitive , if you know what i mean .
that coral looks good .
i don &apos;t understand why i always have to ask him for oral sex .
not like you and your corrado .
bebe , listen , i know we always used to yak about our sex lives .
i think it would be better if we didn &apos;t anymore .
okay .
i mean it .
sure !
just , you &apos;re lucky , that &apos;s all .
so , ma , you coming to the game ?
game ? what game ?
meadow &apos;s team is going to the sectionals .
nobody tells me anything .
did everybody hear me just tell her ?
can anybody think of anything else to talk about ?
all right . uncle jun , how was boca ?
wonderful . i don &apos;t go down enough .
that &apos;s not what i heard .
about what ?
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about .
last time , aunt bobbi bought me a piranha .
a piranha ? come on !
that woman is not your aunt .
livia , i warned you . bobbi is a sweet , sweet girl .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what did i say ?
this wife of yours , she &apos;s got the giggles .
can i be excused ?
we just sat down !
how can you play if you don &apos;t eat ?
you need protein .
no , i don &apos;t , because i quit .
you quit ?
with ally back , you can go to the states .
she slits her wrists , and you think of a game ?
it wasn &apos;t like cobain . it was just a little suicidal gesture .
come back here !
you &apos;re not excused !
let her go . go ahead , honey !
ma !
why don &apos;t you butt out ?
you only act nice when you want to score points .
i will not eat in this house .
junior , take me home .
i &apos;m not finished .
she &apos;ll come back .
the stukas and messerschmitts , they have command of the skies .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m glad meadow quit .
that coach pushes them to the brink . it &apos;s unhealthy .
what do we mean when we say commitment ?
he thinks he can just walk away .
watch it , cowboy , don &apos;t start .
what &apos;s with you and uncle jun ?
don &apos;t bother that coach .
come on . tell me about uncle jun.
no , stop it !
i can &apos;t !
yes , you can .
all right . okay .
gabby dante &apos;s cousin and bobbi go to the same nail parlor .
and your uncle .... no , i shouldn &apos;t say . i shouldn &apos;t !
come on .
okay , okay , okay .
well , let &apos;s just say ...
... your uncle has acquired a taste for her .
uncle jun gives head ?
world @-@ class .
he whistles to the wheat field ?
don &apos;t be disgusting .
he &apos;s a bushman of the kalahari !
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t tell you .
you don &apos;t know when to stop !
my god , if this ever gets out ....
yeah , like you don &apos;t do it . or any of your friends .
bunch of hypocrites .
what goes on in this bedroom stays here , and you know that .
once a year ? i can resist the urge to gossip .
arthur ? you &apos;re home ?
the grease in that frialator .
i &apos;m gonna smell like a cheap french fry forever .
so this is why we scrimp and save to send our kids to that school ?
so our name is dragged through the mud ?
what ?
shelly hauser called me this afternoon .
your friend sent some y.o. &apos; s down there with a stolen tv set ...
... to try and bribe the coach .
from your friends at bada bing !
as if a tv set is gonna get somewhere with a man like coach hauser .
a tv set ?
do you honestly believe that they &apos;re gonna stop there ?
they tried bribing this man .
what &apos;s next ?
always with the extreme scenarios .
no , come on . tell me , what &apos;s next ?
you grew up here .
don &apos;t pretend like you don &apos;t know what tony soprano is capable of .
who is it ?
i found your dog .
what ?
no , you &apos;re mistaken . my dog is upstairs .
golden retriever , blue nylon collar ?
honey , who is it ?
evening , ma &apos;am .
he has our dog .
where is petey ?
he was locked in .
come get him .
i wouldn &apos;t want petey to get hit by a car .
petey , petey !
you okay ? come here .
what , no reward ?
just kidding . i &apos;m an animal lover .
you okay , boy ?
med , cheer up about the coach ...
... because i feel he &apos;ll reconsider the big move .
did you do something ?
what could i do ?
he &apos;s gonna stick around and finish what he started with the girls .
that &apos;s it .
well , did i tell you ?
develop some appreciation , because everyone helps you ...
... and all you do is bitch and moan !
this coach abandons his team , and your friends get all worked up .
so i try to do something .
is that why you think we &apos;re upset ?
because a coach who most of us can &apos;t even stand is leaving ?
you don &apos;t have to love him to be successful .
&quot; catfish &quot; hunter hated billy martin .
bill parcells &apos; guys can &apos;t stand him , till they start to win .
coach hauser had sex with ally .
what ?
that &apos;s why she cut herself . that &apos;s why i &apos;ve been living at her house .
all right , hold on a minute .
maybe ....
with ally ?
meadow , this is horrible .
this is also a serious accusation . what exactly did ally say ?
that they had sex , more than once ...
... that she &apos;s not a virgin anymore !
all right .
ally &apos;s a very pretty girl .
maybe there was ....
maybe there was confusion . maybe she wanted to ...
... look like she was sophisticated in your eyes .
what ?
tony , what if this had been meadow ?
what kind of confusion ?
at her age ? the coach shouldn &apos;t have been in any position ...
... where there &apos;s even a remote possibility of confusion !
i &apos;m losing my mind here .
go downstairs so me and meadow can talk .
jesus fucking christ !
god , now what did i do ?
i only told so he wouldn &apos;t make coach hauser stay .
meadow , this is a horrible , horrible thing .
she &apos;s in love with him . but he won &apos;t leave his wife .
leave his wife ? meadow !
now , he didn &apos;t touch you , right ?
no .
what about deena ?
if she hears about her father , it &apos;ll destroy her .
tell dad to let him go anywhere he wants , okay ?
come here .
moldonado and his brother , they &apos;ll handle it .
mol owes me a solid .
no . no hired help . this is personal .
i &apos;m glad to hear you say that .
i &apos;m gonna give him a real after @-@ school special .
you out of your mind ?
what ?
you kidnapped the coach &apos;s dog . but if you do one more thing--
shut up , arthur . you &apos;re five time zones behind your own ass .
no , i &apos;m fucking serious . you hear me , tony ?
you &apos;re serious ?
want to hear serious ?
want to know what your coach did ?
he fucked little ally vandermeed and who knows who else he fucked .
what are you talking about ? fucked ?
that &apos;s crazy .
that &apos;s why that kid slit her wrist .
and my daughter should know ?
she should have to think about that filth ?
that self @-@ righteous prick put his dick ...
... in my little girl &apos;s soccer teammate .
yeah . she &apos;s in 11th grade , for chrissake !
oh , my god .
chiara . he drove her home one night when it was raining .
oh , my little girl .
degenerate son of a bitch .
he deserves to die !
betraying children ?
believe me , he ain &apos;t gonna be doing that shit no more .
i guarantee you that .
nobody said to put my nephew under surveillance .
i know , junior . i know .
i wanted to be safe and i &apos;m glad i was .
because your nephew isn &apos;t just at that titty bar ...
... and going to soccer games .
go ahead .
twice last week he goes toward the medical center ...
... and they lose him .
a girlfriend .
he &apos;s seeing this russian slit very open .
your nephew is talking to the feds .
where else would he be going that requires such precautions ?
what the fuck else would be the big secret ?
what am i , a swami ?
how you doing ? you &apos;re looking good .
how you feel ?
you shanked it , sil .
i still got the coach on my mind .
we got fresh air , we got sunshine . forget about that shit .

will you let the man tee off ? you yap worse than six barbers !
if you &apos;d have shut up during that mountain lakes game ...

i was ashamed to face my friends .

i don &apos;t know .
i thought you were a baccala man . what are you doing eating sushi ?
you &apos;re fucking running off at the mouth .

unlike some i know .
what &apos;s that mean ?
take it however you want . don &apos;t bullshit me .
guys , we here to play golf or what ?
come on .
arthur ...
... everybody &apos;s just so upset .
the mother &apos;s on sedatives . she &apos;s completely unable to deal .
the father lives in europe somewhere .
the little girl , ally , she thinks it &apos;s all her fault .
bastard . he won &apos;t get away with this !
you got that right .
what ?
hand me that bottle of bug @-@ b @-@ gon , will you ?
arthur , what ?
something going on , artie ?
your mobster friend gonna do something ?
if i had any balls , i would do it myself .
you do have balls . that &apos;s why you &apos;re not like him .
fuck it .
fuck the world !
this isn &apos;t making a slob take his hat off .
this is beating a man to death or cutting his balls off , or what ?
you can &apos;t tell me he doesn &apos;t deserve it !
okay , but ....
listen , think about what you &apos;re saying !
yeah , you tell me .
who &apos;s worse : tony soprano or that child @-@ molesting fuck ?
i trusted him . i &apos;d like to rip his heart out of his chest !
jesus christ , i cannot believe you only think about yourself !
myself ?
myself ?
i resent that , charmaine .
junior , what the fuck ? what &apos;s the matter ?
what ? that bullshit with the sushi ?
no . i don &apos;t know what he was talking about . he babbles .
what ?
you &apos;re another one !
me ? he completely lacked respect .
i &apos;m tired of having to make excuses for him .
it isn &apos;t right .
because he &apos;s a mental weakling .
i know .
you don &apos;t know shit !
he &apos;s seeing a psychiatrist .
how about that ?
my nephew is seeing a psychiatrist . it makes me want to cry .
no shit ?
the indictment &apos;s being prepared . he &apos;s spilling his guts !
i fucking knew it .
no , you didn &apos;t know it . i just told you .
god knows how much of our family business he has .
if the place is bugged ... ?
that &apos;s not admissible .
it &apos;s that doctor @-@ patient privilege . just like us and melvoin .
melvoin &apos;s a lawyer . he &apos;s in the fucking ballpark .
suppose this shrink gets scared or something ?
remember those two brothers in california ?
they whacked their parents ?
the shrink was in a witness chair .
shit .
anthony wants to play games , okay .
i taught him games .
i taught him how to play baseball .
talking about clipping him ?
nobody would slap my wrist if i did .
guys in prison have done half the damage he has .
the judicial system has improved in dealing with sexual predators .
oh , yeah . let &apos;s impeach him .
if you &apos;re telling me of intent to harm him ...
... i must warn you of my duty to alert law enforcement .
why do i tell you anything ?
i &apos;m interested in why you feel punishing this man falls upon you .
it doesn &apos;t fall upon you .
what ?
what would you do ? you &apos;d call the cops ...
... who &apos;d get some judge , who &apos;d give him counseling ...
... to talk about his unhappy childhood , and we could have sympathy for him .
because he &apos;s the victim , right ?
you know what you do ? you ignore the truth .
discredit psychology all you want .
but i continue to ask the question . why do you think you ...
... always have to set things right ?
hey , paulie , is tony in ?
i got to talk to you .
i &apos;m busy right now .
i got to talk to you .
all right . we &apos;ll finish later , all right ?
come on in .
it &apos;s about the thing .
you know what ?
nothing &apos;s happened yet , has it ?
just got to make the call .
i &apos;m savoring the moment .
call it off .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you don &apos;t go near this .
i don &apos;t care about that . it &apos;s wrong , tony .
you can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s wrong ?
what he did isn &apos;t ?
i &apos;m begging you . i hate the guy too .
what do you want to do ?
want to call the cops ? here &apos;s the phone .
they &apos;ll arrest him .
and he &apos;ll get out in two years and move north .
and then ?
he &apos;ll teach girls &apos; soccer and start all over .
you don &apos;t think i want to rip him apart like a chicken ?
i drove by his house . i almost got out .
but you didn &apos;t .
something happens to him , who does it help ?
his daughter ? that girl ?
no . you , tony .
and silvio and me and whoever . it &apos;s just gonna make us feel better .
so don &apos;t even think about calling this justice . leave it to the cops .
look , let me ask you a question .
who are you , coming in here talking to me like this ? !
now , your boyfriend is finished . you deal with it !
okay ?
tony , don &apos;t do it .
this is me asking you .
why don &apos;t you get out ? !
come on .
get the fuck out , go !
let &apos;s go !
come on , come on !
corrado ?
i was worried ! you usually call me when you &apos;re this late .
i bought us some barbecued chicken , salad and lemon meringue pie .
but i got hungry and ate .
did i tell you to keep your mouth shut ? !
did i tell you to keep your goddamn mouth shut ? !
don &apos;t hit me !
you stupid fucking blabbermouth cunt !
i don &apos;t understand !
get your pencils and your crap and don &apos;t be here tomorrow !

fuck it . walk away .
just walk away . don &apos;t do it .

leave it alone .
yeah . no problem .
son of a bitch !
colleagues and neighbors were shocked ...
... to hear of charges brought against hauser ...
... coach of the verbum dei high school girls &apos; soccer team .
alerted by a friend of the alleged victim ...
... whose name cannot be revealed ...
... police issued a warrant for his arrest .
tony , jesus ! you smell like lord calvert .

mixed with alcohol !
