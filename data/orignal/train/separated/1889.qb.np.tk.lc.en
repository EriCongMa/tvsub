in order to properly treat a problem ,
a surgeon needs as much information as she can get .
wasn &apos;t this stupid thing supposed to start already ?
so we ask questions .
questions like ...
&quot; when did the pain begin ? &quot;
it started about 45 minutes ago .
&quot; have you experienced these symptoms before ? &quot;
&quot; do you have a family history ? &quot;
&quot; are you currently sexually active ? &quot;
&quot; have you recently undergone surgery ? &quot;
if you &apos;re unwilling or unable
to answer these and other questions ,
we &apos;re forced to rely on tests for insight .
it &apos;s possible that i may have , by mistake ,
said that if she had any doubts , she should flee .
what ?
she was nervous .
how nervous ?
how nervous was she , callie ?
until those test results come back ...
there &apos;s nothing we can do but wait .
ah , damn it .
what is it ?
there &apos;s too much bleeding .
look , even with the scope , i can &apos;t see a damn thing .
okay . uh , let &apos;s get a c.t. and call the o.r.
i want them ready the second we know what we &apos;re dealing with .
should i call anyone else ?
you &apos;re going into surgery . you &apos;ll be a while .
yeah ?
dr. bailey .
i didn &apos;t forget .
i know that . should i call your fiance ?
y @-@ yes , please .
what does this mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
the lawsuit is ...
maybe ...
maybe we &apos;ll be fine .
maybe we can--
look , just--could we not talk about that ?
not right now .
could i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
um , my beautiful wife @-@ to @-@ be
has been pulled into an emergency surgery ,
so things are gonna be delayed for a little while .
those of you who are doctors will understand .
and those who aren &apos;t , uh ...
well , they &apos;re setting up the buffet ,
the bar &apos;s open in the back .
drink , eat , and just as soon as we &apos;re able ,
we &apos;ll have a little wedding .
that poor handsome fool .
bailey &apos;s probably hopped a boxcar to mexico by now .
i am the worst maid of honor ever .
who made you maid of honor ?
i called it .
and then i tanked it .
uh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m gonna go to the hospital .
right now ?
i &apos;ll go . i &apos;m the general surgeon .
maybe i can tag her out of surgery .
put this in water till i get back .
you really told bailey to run ?
i didn &apos;t say she should run .
i said she could run .
and--and i was joking . i was ... ha ha .
funny ... funny me .
who needs a drink ?
i can stay .
we &apos;ll be fine . you should go .
i don &apos;t really feel like going to a wedding
if i &apos;m gonna be signing divorce papers .
i don &apos;t know what happened .
i heard a crash , checked my rearview .
half the club is eating asphalt ,
banging around like tenpins .
i mean , it &apos;s real , real nasty .
bowling for bikers ?
maybe you should stick around .
yeah .
you just gonna stand there with your junk in your hand ,
or you gonna do something , doc ?
第九季 第十集
multiple contusions . pelvis stabilized in transport .
coming through . watch your back .
you know , i used to ride a donor cycle .
really ? why &apos;d you stop ?
chest tubes hurt like a bitch .
stuart loeb , 35 . vital signs stable .
alert before we pushed 5 of morphine
for a left arm degloving injury .
ooh . he must have been thrown out of his car .
he was on one of the bikes .
seriously , this guy ?
i know , right ?
okay . uh , let &apos;s get him in trauma 1 .
and start making some calls .
we need more hands in here .
right away , doctor .
hey , look at these .
macaroni and cheese in the form of a cupcake .
might be the cutest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
i just ... did something .
i got us a room . just now .
um , a @-@ and the guy at the desk said that it &apos;s really nice
and it has a view .
though honestly , i only care that it has a bed .
are you tired ?
no .
you got us a room .
yes .
s @-@ so we could ...
yes .
okay .
excuse me .
sorry , but if you knew , you &apos;d understand .
what is she doing ?
wait . okay . hold on . listen .
we should take some of that to go .
you know , in case we work up an appetite .
right .
i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ? no , you &apos;re not sorry .
you &apos;re criminally negligent .
dr. webber--
my wife has alzheimer &apos;s ,
and you told me my visits were agitating her .
so instead of monitoring her myself ,
i allowed you to do it .
you want to look at me right now and tell me you &apos;re sorry ?
sir , i understand you &apos;re upset .
though to be clear ,
when i said you should visit less frequently ,
i certainly didn &apos;t mean for you to stop altogether .
what did you just say to me ?
what did you just say to me ? !
dr. webber , they need you in o.r. two .
thank you .
don &apos;t thank me . just go .
is she in the o.r. already ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just said that so you wouldn &apos;t punch that guy out .
is this why she isn &apos;t at the wedding ?
oh , god . the wedding .
i &apos;m gonna go find her . are you okay ?
yeah , go . go .
according to the article ,
the doctors discovered that her hair follicles
had actually been growing nails instead of hair .
like fingernails .
cool story , bro .
can i get anybody a coffee ?
mnh @-@ mnh .
no .
it &apos;s like having dinner with &quot; ripley &apos;s believe it or not ! &quot;
so you &apos;re starting to regret this whole &quot; let &apos;s bring dates &quot; idea ?
no .
no . i love &quot; ripley &apos;s believe it or not ! &quot;
i love easy wedding sex ,
which i &apos;m gonna miss out on now
&apos;cause you jerks can &apos;t keep your hands off each other .
you made me bring sand to the beach ,
and it &apos;s sand i can &apos;t sleep with .
since when can you not sleep with interns ?
i &apos;m a homeowner now . i &apos;ve grown up .
besides , they get all hung up and sad
when you don &apos;t want to be their boyfriend .
it &apos;s not worth the hassle .
you are one classy guy , karev .
i make an effort .
he was just trying to be nice ,
and i got him in trouble with his boss .
i can barely look him in the eye .
dr. avery has nice eyes .
do you think they &apos;re blue or green ... or both ?
don &apos;t . don &apos;t you dare sleep with him .
i &apos;m not . why not ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s the kind of thing leah would do .
you want to be like leah ?
oh , gross . no .
besides , he &apos;s probably not even interested .
of course he &apos;s interested .
interns are like sexual catnip at this hospital .
look at me . i was enjoying a perfectly healthy
teacher @-@ student relationship with kepner ,
and now she &apos;s all over me .
i brought notes so i can keep the conversation about medicine ,
but she keeps asking me all these personal questions ,
and i &apos;m running out of cards .
did you just get paged ? both of you ?
all of us .
big trauma back at the ranch . you kids coming ?
yes , indeed .
yeah , i &apos;m coming , too .
nope . uh , you don &apos;t get to practice medicine
with booze in your system , hobo jo .
you &apos;re hobo jo ?
like &quot; rides the rails and eats beans from a can &quot; ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t know . weird .
shane , you can ride with me .
a beer for me and another round for hobo jo .
you got it .
let me guess . thunderbird
or is it just , uh , straight paint thinner ?
i told your fiance it was an emergency .
but not who the patient was ?
should i have ?
no , no . he &apos;d just send everybody home .
i am still getting married today .
what are you doing here ?
oh , tell me he didn &apos;t call it off .
no one called anything off . i &apos;m here to help .
what &apos;s the situation ?
oh , well , uh , c.t. shows an aortic aneurysm so big ,
it &apos;s torn into the duodenum .
i &apos;ve never seen one that big .
yeah , me neither . scrub fast .
chief , where do you need us ?
just a second , avery .
guess dr. bailey beat us to the fun .
dr. bailey &apos;s here ?
she and dr. grey are working on adele webber in o.r. one .
dr. webber &apos;s wife ?
should we--
you have a degloving injury in trauma 1 .
take care of your patient .
let bailey and grey take care of theirs .
don &apos;t touch me !
dr. hunt , a little help , please .
you come at me with that thing again ,
and you will not like where it ends up .
you two make the rounds .
i want status reports on all the injured ,
and find out what happened out there .
you two aren &apos;t going anywhere except the waiting room .
and , ma &apos;am , you need to sit back .
don &apos;t call me &quot; ma &apos;am . &quot;
it &apos;s gasoline .
and you don &apos;t want to get in the way of club business .
you screw with one of us ,
and we will all screw with you .
okay .
you want your guys taken care of ?
that &apos;s all my guys are trying to do .
now i &apos;ll let these gentlemen conduct their investigation
as long as they do not bother
any of my patients .
and you settle down
and let dr. brooks here do her job .
deal .
how &apos;s gasoline
and the hammer ?
these are people ?
yeah . those are their road names .
you get to pick your road names ,
and you went with stuart ?
i &apos;m not officially in the club .
they let me hang around , ride along with them .
it has been
the greatest time of my entire life .
and i ruined it .
that crash was my fault .
my sister was right .
i had no business being on that bike .
i think your arm would agree .
i don &apos;t know .
i think guys on motorcycles are hot .
all right , stuart , your injuries are extensive ,
but i do think it &apos;s possible we can salvage your hand .
we &apos;re just gonna get you up to the o.r.
and debride your arm .
edwards , you &apos;re with me .
un @-@ unless you &apos;d rather i took dr. ross .
are you kidding ? no . sh @-@ shane &apos;s my guy .
nice .
nice view .
open or closed ?
closed .
uh , lights-- on or off ?
um ... whichever .
how about ...
that &apos;s great .
um , i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
suddenly got so nervous .
me , too .
really ?
oh . okay , hold on .
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
um ... i think i should take the leg off first .
of course . yeah . i can help if--
no , no , no .
um , velcro straps and plastic sockets aren &apos;t exactly sexy ,
and i wanted this evening to be all about sexy ,
so i think that i need to take the leg off myself .
and i need you not to watch .
oh , you want me to go in the bathroom
until your leg &apos;s off and you &apos;re under the covers ?
would you ?
okay .
sure .
murphy , get your hands in here .
dr. bailey .
i need you to put pressure on the aorta ,
there under the diaphragm .
it &apos;s just a stopgap
until we can mobilize the duodenum
off the aneurysm .
um , grey .
murphy , i got this .
go up in the gallery and sit with him .
okay .
uh , have you got a little brown paper bag you can put that in ?
would you stop ?
i had no parents . i lived in my car .
so , yes , i have trust issues . comes with the territory .
you need to stop acting like you &apos;re the only person
who ever had a crappy childhood .
yeah ? how many foster homes did you get kicked out of
before you moved in to your car ?
uh , 17 .
and i didn &apos;t live in my car . i went to juvie .
stop making fun of me .
i &apos;m not .
really ?
and you &apos;re actually lucky that your folks abandoned you .
means you didn &apos;t have to watch your schizo mom
go after your baby brother with a steak knife .
fine . fair .
but you never woke up in the middle of the night
with junkies banging on your bedroom windshield ,
praying they &apos;d get tired or bored
before they put a rock through a window .
no , i didn &apos;t , because the junkie was my dad ,
and he didn &apos;t break windows , just fingers .
well , did you ever have foster parents
that made you and 19 other kids
sleep on cots in the basement ...
locking the doors at lights out ,
so that if you had to pee in the middle of the night
you had to use buckets they set up along the wall ?
buckets you couldn &apos;t see
because if you turned the lights on ,
the bigger kids would hold you down
and take those buckets and ...
no . never .
me neither .
saw it in a movie on cable .
how did you get cable in your car ?
i don &apos;t live in my car anymore , jerk .
stuart ?
he went down first . everybody else followed .
emily bennett ?
oh , the last person that called me that
is somewhere choking on a tire iron .
excuse me .
g @-@ gasoline ?
uh , i &apos;m dr. yang .
dr. brooks found that you have some fluid around your heart .
so i would like to do a pericardiocentesis
to relieve that pressure .
no , thanks . you &apos;ve see my x @-@ rays .
my body &apos;s 85 % metal .
i get over stuff .
well , you just don &apos;t get over this .
untreated , you could die .
treated i &apos;m stuck in a bed .
no dice , dr. yang .
i can &apos;t be out of commission ,
not when my boys need me to take care of business .
actually , they brought a guy in with us--stuart .
have you seen him ?
no .
i &apos;ll tell you what--
you find him , you take me to see him ...
and then i &apos;ll let you do whatever you want .
ow ! damn it , kid .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re doing that right .
call the redhead over here .
there &apos;s no need to--
no , no , i ain &apos;t gonna suffer
just because you &apos;re avoiding your old lady .
my what ?
i seen the way she looks at you .
she &apos;s not looking at me .
not now . now she &apos;s ignoring you ,
which means she really digs you .
ow ! damn it !
what is going on ?
this kid &apos;s a menace , that &apos;s what .
okay .
sir , just calm down . this is a teaching hospital .
all right ?
just ...
allow me to assist dr. ross with his technique , okay ?
yeah .
okay .
all right , so for a corner stitch like this ,
it &apos;s usually best to use
a half @-@ buried horizontal mattress stitch .
so you go in like that ...
okay . i think i got it .
i mean ...
it--it &apos;s like this , right ?
yes . great work .
you &apos;re such a quick study . keep it up .
keep it up .
her aorta is like a rock .
i don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gonna sew in this graft .
where is this bleeding coming from ?
i &apos;m not sure . hold pressure .
you should be down there watching what they &apos;re doing .
i can see from here .
primary aortoduodenal fistulas--
they almost never happen .
why not ?
this usually would present as a kind of pulsating mass .
something like that , a patient wouldn &apos;t wait to seek treatment .
the--the fistula would never develop .
with alzheimer &apos;s ,
they don &apos;t remember if they told anyone .
someone should &apos;ve been there ...
paying attention .
you should be down there .
sir , respectfully , i am not going down there .
you should stop asking .
the proximal clamp
fractured the atherosclerotic plaque .
we have to get above the bleeding .
what are they doing now ?
aneurysms like these are caused by
a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque .
their clamp broke off a chunk
of one of these plaques
and that aorta opened right back up .
they think they &apos;ll be able to move the clamp up higher
and control the bleeding ,
but they &apos;re already up to the superior mesenteric artery .
there isn &apos;t any place left for them to go .
i don &apos;t understand . what does that mean ?
it means , they &apos;ve just about run out of options .
i don &apos;t know what else to do .
just wait . just-- just a minute . just a minute .
is there anyone i can call for you ?
bailey .
try dividing the renal vein .
that might get you above the fractured plaque .
but she &apos;s exsanguinating . i don &apos;t think--
just try it !
okay . scalpel .
here you go , doctor .
hey . hey . are you ...
hey . look , i was kidding .
come on . that wasn &apos;t even the worst thing i said .
oh , god . please .
you &apos;re not a garbage eater , okay ? i &apos;m sorry .
oh @-@ ho , look at your face .
ah , i got you . i so got you .
what ?
tears , baby .
the number one tool of the street kid .
turn on the water works , you can get out of anything .
wait , wait . you--you can just cry like that ?
got three surgeries out of you , chump .
oh , come on . that &apos;s not fair .
chicks can get away with junk like that .
that would never work for me .
you &apos;re wrong .
a girl crying is one thing ,
but a guy crying freaks everybody out .
really ?
for sure .
show me how .
coming up .
hello .
hey , you &apos;re awake .
no , not really .
oh , sorry .
i just--i wanted to check your post @-@ op vitals .
how &apos;s your b.p. ?
you know who would know that would be a nurse .
why don &apos;t you call a nurse ?
right . i &apos;ll do that .
why are you whispering ?
oh , i &apos;m in a hotel bathroom .
and i &apos;m about to have sex ...
for the first time in months .
i &apos;m hanging up now .
oh , okay . well , rest up .
i , uh , decided to take a bath ,
which you &apos;re gonna appreciate ...
&apos;cause i smell amazing .
i &apos;m sorry , callie . i &apos;m ...
i wanted to be spontaneous and fun .
but i ...
i can &apos;t .
and i &apos;m so sorry , callie .
i &apos;m--i ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m not ready .
please don &apos;t be mad .
what are you doing ?
calling room service . we &apos;re gonna need champagne
to go with our mac and cheese cupcakes .
what ?
uh , sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
your technique-- it &apos;s kind of beautiful .
it &apos;s dr. sloan &apos;s technique , actually .
but i am pretty good at it .
here . you try .
okay .
hey , uh , just , uh , checking in .
what &apos;s the story ?
uh , s @-@ stuart &apos;s afraid he &apos;s not gonna be able to ride anymore
because he wiped out and hit chicken bill ,
and chicken bill hit roach @-@ clip , who ended up
taking out gasoline , the hammer , and blue corner pete--
medically .
i meant what &apos;s the story medically ?
well , his limb is still viable .
and we &apos;re almost done with the debridement .
so as soon as he heals up ,
i will get him back in here for a skin graft .
mm . that sounds good .
thank you .
i think i &apos;ll take it from here .
okay . definitely .
you need to stop .
you are not gross and you are not karev .
owen .
oh , cristina , i &apos;m sorry .
i haven &apos;t had two seconds to think about--
oh , uh , no , me either .
um , actually , i wasn &apos;t looking for you .
is avery still in there with stuart ?
yeah . why ?
oh , my patient needs a pericardiocentesis ,
and she won &apos;t let me touch her
until i take her to see him .
let me guess . we &apos;re talking about gasoline ?
you know gasoline ?
oh , we go way back . a couple of hours ago ,
she threatened to have me beaten senseless .
sounds like her . what a doll .
wait .
she wants to get close to stuart ?
yeah . what ?
i need you to page security
and have them meet me in the er as soon as possible .
right away , doctor .
owen , what ?
where the hell did she go ?
stuart &apos;s the reason they all crashed .
you screw with one of them , they all screw with you .
we don &apos;t keep any tire irons around , do we ?
we need to find her . now .
they &apos;re sewing in the graft now .
onto the aorta ?
yes .
what &apos;s her bp . ?
100 over 60 .
heart rate ?
98 .
what &apos;s happening , sir ?
dr. webber ?
it &apos;s working .
it &apos;s working .
don &apos;t you freakin &apos; touch me !
move your ass or he &apos;ll move it for you !
gasoline , this wasn &apos;t our deal .
shove your deal .
you cagers wouldn &apos;t let me see stuart ,
and now my guys find out he had to have surgery ?
i need to see him now !

i think that every food should be turned into a cupcake .
lasagna cupcakes .
mashed potato cupcakes .
mm .
callie .
please don &apos;t run .
what ?
it &apos;s all been awful .
and i &apos;ve been awful .
but i &apos;m just starting to feel like myself again .
and i know that not everything
can be about my leg all the time .
and i don &apos;t want it to be ,
but right now , it just ...
it is .
but i can &apos;t lose you .
so please ...
don &apos;t run .
after the car accident ...

you okay ?
yeah . just promise me .
i promise .
thank you .
insert the needle just below the xiphoid .
good .
that &apos;s good .
dragging her all over the hospital
wasn &apos;t the best idea .
you &apos;ve met her .
how well do you think it goes when i say no ?
you &apos;re gonna need to explain stuart .
he &apos;s our accountant .
got us on a group health plan ,
helped us set up a christmas toy drive .
he wanted to ride , so we let him hang around .
thought it was funny .
now he &apos;s like family .
she got him one of these ...
which means he &apos;s one of us for life .
if he was gonna die , she wanted him to at least see it .
have you seen his arm ?
doesn &apos;t look like he &apos;s gonna get on a bike again .
what do you drive , doc ?
pickup .
yeah . figures .
you &apos;re a cager .
whenever you hit the road , you &apos;re stuck in a metal box .
but the day you step out of that cage ,
say sayonara to your job , your marriage ,
or whatever the hell else is boxing you in ,
ah , you &apos;ll never give that up .
oh , i--i &apos;m--i &apos;m coming . i have to get my dress .
okay , take a breath .
just , um , i didn &apos;t forget .
it was adele webber .
i mean , if it was anybody else--
well , is she okay ?
uh , stable in the i.c.u.
we thought she wasn &apos;t gonna make it .
look , if i &apos;d known it was her , i--
hey , we &apos;re gonna make it .
i don &apos;t know what they did with my dress .
look , miranda . miranda , slow down .
slow down .
okay , i forgot .
just for ...
like 20 minutes .
we--we were in the trauma room ,
and she &apos;d lost so much blood ,
and we had to rush up to endoscopy ,
and in those 20 minutes ,
i forgot ...
about you and the wedding .
somebody had to remind me .
well , was a person dying ?
i mean , really dying , right then ?
well , yeah .
well , then you &apos;re supposed to forget .
anyway , you were never so crazy about the wedding
in the first place .
y @-@ yeah , but i--
you were crazy about me , right ?
yeah .
about marrying me ?
you were sure about that ?
i &apos;m just so scared .
see , i &apos;m--i &apos;m scared that you get it now
only because it was adele webber .
and see , and this is not gonna be the last time that i forget ,
because i have so many things i want to do ,
things i want to be .
see , my ambition it killed my last marriage .
i don &apos;t want to do that to you .
miranda , miranda , you ...
you do know that i &apos;m not at home
waiting around with a roast in the oven ?
yeah . no , i--i &apos;m in los angeles ,
becoming a surgeon , too .
i @-@ i have things i want to do ...
and be .
and--and--and w--
we may only be together five minutes every two months ,
but hey , when we do ,
we will save every second .
because we both know
how valuable those five minutes are .
do you love me ?
more than i can hold in my heart .
you &apos;re sure about that ?
i am completely sure of that .
do you want to spend the rest of your life with me ,
even if it is only in ... 5 @-@ minute increments
every two months ?
i do .
then by the power vested in me
by the state of washington ,
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
i am so sorry . i didn &apos;t mean--
hey , you cut that crap out right now .
you didn &apos;t do anything .
the hammer saw the whole thing .
that minivan drifted into our lane .
could &apos;ve made any one of us wipe out the way you did .
that &apos;s right .
is that mine ?
uh , uh , does this mean that i get my road name ?
we were all thinking maybe &quot; road rash . &quot;
god . that &apos;s freakin &apos; hard @-@ core .
we missed the whole thing .
well , maybe she won &apos;t notice .
i hope whatever you were doing was worth it ,
