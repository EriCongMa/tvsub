backaches , jaw pain , nausea .
hey . did you eat ?
amelia got dinner .
it &apos;s nothing special .
just a little pasta from our regular place .
sit down . i &apos;ll grab you a plate .
i got it .
in men , these things are probably exactly what they seem like .
amelia &apos;s back .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you leave all the doors open --
everywhere , all the time .
what ?
hey , uh , try the artichoke .
bathroom doors , cabinets , everything --
open , all the time .
but in women , they &apos;re all symptoms of a heart attack .
hey , mer , do you want some wine ?
unless that &apos;s not -- is that --
it &apos;s fine .
okay .
you invited me back .
it &apos;s fine .
just close a thing once in a while .
mer , if you &apos;ve changed your mind , say the word .
i can go .
no ! it &apos;s fine .
sometimes the symptom is actually hiding
what &apos;s going on underneath .
so , which resident are you guys nominating
for the preminger research grant ?
i &apos;m gonna go to bed .
me too .
we were just sitting down together .
tired .
early morning .
it &apos;s all in the way it presents itself .
&quot; the winner of the grant is awarded one full research year
in residence at the preminger research center .
each attending will nominate one candidate
and submit them to the chief of surgery ,
who will then review and make a decision based on ... &quot;
i didn &apos;t know i was eligible to apply .
yeah . it &apos;s open to any resident , any year .
you gonna apply ?
no .
i just got to grey @-@ sloan .
i can barely find the bathrooms .
&quot; is resourceful . &quot; okay .
do you think that i should write
that i &apos;m &quot; resourceful &quot; or &quot; inventive &quot; ?
mm , put that you &apos;re both .
put that you &apos;re annoying when you think out loud .
why are these spaces so small ?
these spaces cannot contain how awesome i am .
okay .
yes , this is gold .
see ? i just won this thing .
you don &apos;t even need an awesome application .
you have shepherd in your corner .
oh , i did , until you took over her service .
i didn &apos;t do it !
sure .
webber &apos;s scramble did it .
well , when you apply next year , shepherd will have your back .
and grey . and torres .
you &apos;ll be set .
remember when they all hated you ?
vividly .
okay , i &apos;m done .
me too .
press &quot; submit &quot; on three ?
1 ... 2 ... 3 .
i did not meddle !
you meddled . you are a meddler !
he is the father of that baby !
suing his ex @-@ wife for fraud is no way to be a father .
that hussy wouldn &apos;t be an ex @-@ wife
if she hadn &apos;t signed those divorce papers
without disclosing her pregnancy .
&quot; hussy &quot; ? !
this is april kepner we &apos;re talking about !
and this is my grandchild that we &apos;re talking about
that i won &apos;t get to see
unless jackson overturns that divorce
and gets his parental rights back !
meddler .
you better stop saying that !
hey , i &apos;ll say what i want !
i am trying to help my son .
and you are a meddler , a busybody ,
a helicopter mama , a nosy nellie , a buttinsky !
that is trash talk !
all up in the bug juice .
you don &apos;t know the flavor , woman .
we said no trash talk in the bedroom .
we said no work talk in the bedroom .
just for the record , i am right .
you are wrong .
meddler .
i still think i should wait until next year
to apply for the grant .
why ? you &apos;re eligible now .
technically , but they always give the grant
to a senior resident anyway .
except for when they don &apos;t .
so you think i should try ?
look , if this is what you want , then sure -- apply .
it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;m finally getting settled in here .
i have friends .
i just ...
met sofia .
i don &apos;t want to run across the country for a year .
i can wait .
i want to be here .
well , i can accept that .
so , you are 14 .
are your parents here ? who brought you ?
i took the bus .
is this gonna take long ?
i have to get back for my history test .
um , well , i mean , it just kind of sounds like a cold .
i @-@ i know , but it &apos;s just
m @-@ my stomach just hurts when i cough ... or sneeze ...
or move sometimes .
okay .
let &apos;s take a look .
can you lean back ?
can you lift up your shirt for me ?
also ...
i @-@ i &apos;m pregnant .
okay , you buried the lead there .
um , page o.b.
okay .
i don &apos;t understand . you haven &apos;t called back any
of the family law attorneys i recommended .
ma , i really got to prep this nasal reconstruction .
oh , well . we have choices .
money is no object .
my baby needs a lawyer , and i &apos;m gonna get you the best .
oh , i &apos;m done having this conversation .
reynolds is hard to get a sit @-@ down with ,
but you &apos;re an avery , and that ought to get us a phone call .
i &apos;m not sure i want to avery this yet .
oh , yes , you do you want to avery this .
mother !
april has the power -- all the power .
you better get some power .
so , there &apos;s an organ procurement at overbrook ?
yes , heart and liver . patient is getting critical .
i am so glad -- not about the patient , about the procurement .
it is the perfect excuse to ditch bailey &apos;s budget meeting .
i want to ditch bailey &apos;s budget meeting .
i think we got it covered .
oh , come on , owen . it &apos;s a budget meeting .
okay , fine . i &apos;ll meet you in the ambulance bay in 10 .
deluca &apos;s getting the coolers .
we &apos;re -- w @-@ what are you doing ?
deluca &apos;s coming ?
sorry .
finish up a consult .
what are you doing here ?
pierce asked me to cover a heart recovery with grey .
it &apos;s my heart recovery , and you &apos;re making us late .
well , i got here as soon as i could .
what happened to pierce ?
said she had a budget meeting .
she didn &apos;t want to ride with deluca .
then why isn &apos;t deluca here ?
why am i here ?
all right .
we &apos;re good . let &apos;s move .
how along have you been feeling pain ?
i think like 6 am .
who &apos;s your doctor ?
you ?
have you been getting any prenatal care at all ?
oh , my god !
that &apos;s my mom !
what is she doing here ? you called her ? !
no . no , i didn &apos;t , but - - she can &apos;t know .
what ?
she doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m pregnant .
you can &apos;t tell her . please !
i won &apos;t .
promise .
yes , i @-@ i @-@ i promise .
jenny , um , i can help you talk to your mom .
no , y @-@ you can &apos;t . she &apos;ll freak out .
you &apos;re pregnant . she &apos;s gonna find out soon .
why not tell her so that she can help you ?
because this is not what we do .
that &apos;s what she says any time i forget to do the dishes
or get a &quot; b. &quot;
&quot; this is not what we do , jenny . &quot;
i &apos;m not supposed to even have a boyfriend ,
so this would
dr. kepner , this is ...
jennifer ?
what are you doing here ?
did you track my phone again ?
yes , i tracked your phone again .
mom , that is so invasive .
i pay for the phone . i get to know where it is .
same goes for you .
it &apos;s the middle of the school day !
why are you even tracking me right now ?
well , you &apos;re not in school , are you ?
this is not what we do , jenny .
hi . jenny ? i &apos;m dr. robbins .
um , i hear that you &apos;re having a little --
a little abdominal pain .
um , and dr. robbins is an abdominal doctor ,
so , um ...
we &apos;re gonna take jenny up to c.t. to get a closer look ,
and we &apos;ll let you know as soon as we get the results , all right ?
hey , hey , guess who &apos;s joining you
on shepherd &apos;s dbs implantation .
uh , can you get me up to speed ?
getting a little face time in with shepherd
before the meeting tonight ?
i am the wind beneath her wings ,
and i just need to be sure she remembers that .
well , i &apos;ve got your back .
ladies .
let &apos;s go .
wait , wait . let me lead .
that &apos;s very nice .
no , don &apos;t clap for that . that was -- that was garbage .
uh , dr. blake - and dr. shepherd and , uh ...
and who is this ?
haven &apos;t seen your face before .
it &apos;s a nice face .
this is dr. edwards .
god .
why are all the doctors in this hospital so hot ?
well , that &apos;s - - seriously .
it &apos;s like a -- it &apos;s like a condition of employment here .
let &apos;s talk about your brain .
edwards , business time .
kyle diaz , 34 .
diagnosed two years ago
with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis .
increased symptoms recently .
how come you know so much about me
and i haven &apos;t even met you yet ?
symptoms include persistent tremor in the right hand .
yeah , this damn thing
showed up right as i was landing a 13 @-@ city tour .
uh , only time i had bad timing .
i prayed for a long time for this break .
i mean , this is ...
this is big .
yeah , it &apos;s huge for me . i mean , i &apos;m the opening act .
the audience won &apos;t be there to see me , but
but i swear they &apos;ll leave knowing my name .
and i have to kick ass , but i can &apos;t .
not with this ... wobbly hand .
well , deep brain stimulation has been proven
to help alleviate intractable tremors like yours .
so , when i wake up , maybe i can show you how i really play .
the ... plan
is to actually keep you conscious while we operate ,
using m.r.i. images to target the general area of concern .
blake ?
no , i figured we &apos;d be using intraoperative micro @-@ recordings
to precisely locate the nucleus .
exactly , and how will we know when the procedure is working ?
having our patient perform delicate motor skills
while we introduce the electrodes .
in kyle &apos;s case , he will play the guitar .
wait . so , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m gonna play the guitar
while you are poking around in my brain ?
that way , we can know exactly when we &apos;ve nailed the tremor .
well , that &apos;s impossible .
no , it &apos;s possible .
you &apos;ll be awake and able to play .
no , for you .
i mean , i don &apos;t know if you know what happens
when -- when women hear me play .
your hand is gonna get a little shaky .
well , i &apos;ll push through it .
and blake and i will be performing the operation .
edwards , i need you with kyle .
i &apos;ll be -- blake &apos;s assisting ?
i need you to monitor the tremor ,
let us know when we got it .
well ...
it &apos;s gonna be one hell of a first date .
her mother really doesn &apos;t know ?
nope .
that &apos;s gotta be a lot of work , hiding it for this long .
yeah . it is .
it &apos;s a hard thing to keep under wraps .
aren &apos;t we sort of obligated to tell the mother she &apos;s pregnant ?
i mean , if the kid &apos;s in danger ...
mm , legally we &apos;re obligated not to ,
unless the patient gives us permission .
if it were my kid ,
i &apos;d want us to break that law .
oh , warren .
what do you see here ?
blood in the lesser sac .
is that an aneurysm ?
yeah . splenic artery aneurysm .
what are the risks ?
if it bursts , it could cause an instant massive hemorrhage .
the patient and the baby both could bleed to death .
now can we tell the mother ?
no .
yes .
is that your name up there ?
seems that way .
bowel resection with dr. webber .
they say he &apos;s good .
easy on the eyes , too .
some men would send flowers .
nasty @-@ ass necrotic bowel is nice , too .
complicated procedure .
gives us time to talk .
and since we are at work ...
no subject is off limits .
i &apos;ll see you in the scrub room , dr. avery .
you can yammer on all you want .
doesn &apos;t mean i have to listen .
so , who do you like for this preminger thing ?
you know , who i don &apos;t work with is edwards ,
but cristina really liked her .
amelia loves her .
why aren &apos;t we moving ?
bridge traffic .
amelia moved back in , you know ?
did you know that ?
no .
she was asking about you .
yeah , well , you can tell her that i &apos;m not an alcoholic
if that &apos;s what she &apos;s worried about .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what she was worried about .
i think she &apos;s one . that &apos;s what she &apos;s worried about .
shepherd ?
shepherd drinks .
i bought her one once .
when ?
months ago .
i didn &apos;t know .
you did that .
what ?
you did that to her ? !
i did what ? i didn &apos;t know .
i @-@ i asked her . she said yes .
she didn &apos;t tell me she was an alcoholic .
you did it !
hold on ! wait !
we have a job to do .
the two of you can kill each other later .
a bubble in my artery ?
did i hurt the baby ?
no , no .
it &apos;s so big that even a sneeze could have made it bleed .
yeah , and the good news is that the bleeding has stopped ,
but the splenic aneurysm could burst at any moment .
yeah , which would be very dangerous
for you and for your baby .
oh , god . oh , god .
jenny , listen , i can fix this .
i can operate and make sure that it doesn &apos;t bleed .
surgery ? unh @-@ unh .
if we do surgery , my mom will find out for sure .
maybe she should .
i mean , don &apos;t you want your mom &apos;s help and --
no !
she &apos;ll send me away - o @-@ or make me give my baby away .
can &apos;t you just give me some pill to make it stay the way it is ?
we could give it time .
keep you under close observation .
and there &apos;s a chance that it could resolve on its own .
then let &apos;s do that . we &apos;ll wait .
jenny , it &apos;s far less dangerous
to do something about it right now .
i think if your mom had the information ,
she would -- she would opt -- - you said we can wait .
i want to wait .
okay .
then we wait .
the better option is surgery .
the only reason she &apos;s choosing to wait
is to avoid telling her mother that she &apos;s pregnant .
she has the right to tell her mom when she &apos;s ready .
she &apos;s 14 !
she needs her mom &apos;s help to make this decision .
y @-@ you &apos;re thinking like a mother
because you &apos;re about to be one ,
but you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re not her mother .
we &apos;re her doctors .
what if it were sofia ?
april ! we can &apos;t .
we can tell her about the splenic bleed ,
but not about the pregnancy .
she &apos;s just gonna put her baby and herself at risk .
jenny &apos;s the patient .
she has the final say .
it &apos;s the end of the discussion .
this day is already on my nerves .
i &apos;ve rounded on both grey and torres &apos; services .
i &apos;ve finished their post @-@ op notes .
my beautiful , genius brain is on fire .
i &apos;m gonna get this grant .
my beautiful , genius brain is being wasted .
i &apos;ve got to hold hands with a hot rock star
while blake assists with his brain surgery .
ooh , wait . back up .
no , no , don &apos;t .
he &apos;s hot , but he &apos;s nasty hot .
like in @-@ your @-@ face hot .
he keeps aggressively eye @-@ sexing me .
he &apos;s not my kind of thing . it &apos;s a distraction .
oh , god , i haven &apos;t had sex in so long .
i had sex this morning .
i thought we were sharing .
the point is , shepherd needs to see me shine today ,
and there is blake being all shiny , too .
i knew it .
you hate that shepherd is taking blake under her wing .
because it &apos;s my wing !
blake has been on neuro for , what , two weeks ?
and she gets to scrub in over me ?
really ?
blake probably can &apos;t even clip an aneurysm .
stephanie -- - no .
come on , she &apos;s from dillard .
all right , listen ,
i know you don &apos;t want to , but -- - no , you listen .
she sat across that table , looked my son in the eye ,
didn &apos;t say a damn thing about the pregnancy ,
treating him like he &apos;s some inconvenience ,
and he is the baby &apos;s father .
well , that may be true ,
but we should be helping them through this .
what choice do we have other than to fight ?
a lawsuit , though ?
if jackson can make a case that april committed fraud ,
he &apos;s get a shot at getting full custody of that baby .
if april &apos;s gonna fight dirty , jackson can , too .
this is about my grandchild .
oh , really ?
because i don &apos;t see a grandchild .
all i see are two kids in trouble .
and they aren &apos;t your kids .
maybe just keep your opinions to yourself .
understood .
but you &apos;re my wife .
and i think i should be able
to tell you when you &apos;re making a wrong turn ,
and this is a very wrong turn .
i can &apos;t believe we sat in traffic for an hour .
you can just relax . we made it .
what are they doing ? are they already recovering the heart ?
no , no . hunt , something &apos;s wrong .
hey , what are you doing to our heart ?
crapped the bed about two minutes ago .
you guys are grey @-@ sloan ?
what are you saying ?
lidocaine .
it &apos;s in v @-@ fib . arrhythmic .
we &apos;re trying to keep it pumping to perfuse the other organs .
okay , move aside . let me see .
you told me this was a good healthy heart !
he became hyperkalemic .
we tried to reverse it with insulin .
then why is it fibrillating now ? !
okay , hunt , just let me work .
charge it 20 .
charge .
we have no heart , we have no liver .
one &apos;s no good without the other ,
they &apos;ll reallocate it .
riggs ?
clear !
come on !
come on , baby ! come on !
it &apos;s gone .
this heart &apos;s dead . i &apos;m sorry .
we need to do the calculations with m.r.i.
i need someone to go supervise kyle &apos;s head frame .
i can do it .
i can do it .
blake , go .
i was hoping to be in the field , assisting .
i need you with kyle . he likes you .
he thinks i &apos;m a challenge . correctly .
then challenge him . he &apos;ll be calmer .
so , the preminger grant nomination is tonight .
edwards .
i &apos;m not gonna discuss a confidential recommendation .
i know . i &apos;m not asking .
i &apos;m just hoping you bear in mind our significant history
when making your recommendation .
edwards !
i &apos;m not asking !
edwards , look at me .
you and i are not allowed to discuss
whether or not - i will be singing your praises
to dr. bailey tonight .
to do so ...
would be unprofessional , unethical , and not at all cool ,
so ... i am not going to discuss it .
understood ?
understood .
all right .
she said , &quot; she &apos;s from dillard . &quot;
like it &apos;s a welding school .
and what &apos;d you say ?
nothing .
i just stood there .
ouch .
i know , i know . i didn &apos;t have my words .
why didn &apos;t -- - why didn &apos;t i have my words ? !
well , just say your words now .
okay , okay .
i ...
thought we were friends .
no . weak . better words .
i know this place can be competitive ...
and that you can be an insecure bitch sometimes ,
but you would not be talking behind my back
if you weren &apos;t scared to death
that somebody might give you a run for your money !
and i might be from dillard , but i am here now .
i &apos;m right behind you , breathing down your neck ,
and i am a dark freakin &apos; horse !
drop the mike and walk away .
and i &apos;m having sex tonight .
i &apos;m inviting all you lovely people
over to the house tonight for dinner .
like a -- like a dinner party .
we &apos;re not doing that again .
just takeout . whatever .
just come over at 8 : 00 , and i &apos;ll feed you .
but we have the nomination meeting for the preminger grant .
fine . 8 : 30 .
ben and bailey will be going home at 8 : 30 .
i &apos;m having great sex tonight .
i might be having sex tonight .
i mean , i don &apos;t know yet . we don &apos;t really plan it .
you guys have to come .
amelia just moved back in ,
and meredith and amelia need to ease into it , okay ,
or it &apos;s gonna be -- it &apos;ll be ...
it &apos;s gonna start as something small
that will snowball into something big ,
and there will be blood .
this thing is fragile .
but if you guys are there , then it can stay nice .
oh , so , you want us to come to be a buffer ?
yes . thank you .
like a human shield ?
you get it . so , you &apos;ll be there ?
no .
god , no .
sex .
so , for now , we wait to see if your daughter &apos;s abdominal bleed
resolves on its own .
you think waiting is the best option ?
well , it &apos;s what jenny wants .
jenny is 14 .
when i was 14 , i was stealing street signs
and getting knocked up by my loser boyfriend ,
so forgive me for not trusting a 14 @-@ year @-@ old
to make judgment calls .
i &apos;m asking what you think .
i think that surgery is the better option .
then that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
of course , you know , with surgery ,
there are -- are always risks .
surgery would happen when ?
today or ...
actually , there is one more thing .
dr. kepner .
what is it ? what are not you telling me ? !
there is also the risk that jenny could lose her baby .
her what ?
jenny is pregnant .
how long ? - mom , listen --
how long ? !
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
like a few months or something .
why would you tell her ? !
look at me , not them . me .
how many times have i told you , &quot; be careful , be smart &quot; ?
not to end up like me .
how many times ? !
yeah , mom , like a million times
that i am your biggest , stupidest mistake !
sorry i messed up your life so bad !
jennifer , that is not what i meant !
i &apos;m just waiting for you to say it --
&quot; this is not what we do , jenny &quot; !
it &apos;s not .
you screwed this up .
she needed to know all the risks .
no , she didn &apos;t .
yes , she did .
if she was gonna convince jenny to get that surgery , yes .
how &apos;s that going so far ?
there &apos;s a risk either way .
are you done with your side ?
ah , working on it .
it &apos;s just these ...
damn adhesions . yeah , i see them .
yeah .
i &apos;ve been here before .
we need enough space to get a secure closure .
i &apos;m talking about jackson .
looped pds .
jackson &apos;s father could be loving and generous and fun .
he also could be a child -- selfish , spiteful .
when we ended , he just wanted to hurt me ,
so he took the only thing that mattered .
he took jackson .
he took him across country ,
thought he could take my boy from me
and that i would just roll over .
i told him he didn &apos;t know who the hell he married .
i fought for my son ,
and i &apos;m not about to stop fighting .
richard , war is ugly , senseless , and scary as hell ,
but there are some things worth going to war over .
maybe you can close without me .
we can monitor each cell in his brain .
dr. shepherd , you have plus 10 y , minus 20 on z .
almost there .
keep him talking .
kyle , what kind of music do you play ?
oh , now you want to get to know me ?
right now , it &apos;s my job .
how &apos;s he doing , edwards ?
why don &apos;t you ...
try to play me something ?
uh , persistent tremor . no improvement .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little weird
that you &apos;re seeing the inside of my brain
and you haven &apos;t seen the inside of my apartment ?
you do not know when to quit , do you ?
come on . amuse me .
you said it &apos;s , like , your job or something .
dr. shepherd , he &apos;s developed a left facial droop .
signal &apos;s getting distorted .
i have a small hemorrhage here . what next ?
uh , pull back on the probe , close him up ,
and wait for the bleed to stop .
or you can control the bleed right now .
use a biopsy needle to irrigate the bleed ,
then dilute and suction until it stops .
good call , edwards .
biopsy needle .
i ca-- i can &apos;t feel parts of my face .
what is happening ?
you have a very small bleed in your brain .
don &apos;t worry -- dr. shepherd has it under control .
syringe . blake , now .
what &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s free @-@ styling .
she &apos;s a rock star , too .
all right , i &apos;m right here .
what happened ?
i was giving her a routine abdominal exam
when her pressure bottomed out .
it hurts -- so much .
tell me what &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;re gonna take a look , okay ?
she &apos;s hypotensive , and her crit &apos;s at 18 .
tell me what &apos;s happening .
it &apos;s not labor .
your aneurysm has ruptured ,
and i know you didn &apos;t want surgery ,
but now we have no choice .
we &apos;re gonna get you into the o.r.
mom ?
they &apos;ve got you , honey .
everything is gonna be fine .
what a waste .
how &apos;s that ?
such a waste .
the heart .
i &apos;m sorry for your guy .
well , maybe if we &apos;d gotten here sooner .
well , it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference .
the heart was in v @-@ fib . damage was done .
they should have known -- - you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right .
it couldn &apos;t have been your fault .
it was never your fault , not with amelia --
i didn &apos;t know , all right ?
if i caused her a problem , i &apos;m sorry ,
but she didn &apos;t tell me -- - disaster happens wherever you are
because you are there , like with megan .
all right , no !
owen , i &apos;m not gonna do this again !
no ?
okay , no ! all right ? !
i think you &apos;re starting to drive yourself crazy .
it &apos;s him .
at some point , you just have to learn to let go .
amelia took that drink .
it doesn &apos;t matter who offered it to her .
she would tell you that herself .
riggs tried to talk - your sister off that chopper .
what ?
she needed to be with her patient .
he tried to go . she wouldn &apos;t let him .
that &apos;s what he told you -- t @-@ that he ... - that &apos;s what he told me .
meredith , he didn &apos;t say anything to her .
he wasn &apos;t anywhere near that chopper .
he was off screwing some woman from supply corps -- again .
that &apos;s why megan got on the chopper --
to get away from him .
my sister was leaving him .
when i said we hate him , i meant it .
you hanging in there , kyle ?
oh , hey . you &apos;re all right .
loss of speech is normal .
it &apos;s temporary , okay ?
hey . it &apos;ll come back .
dr. shepherd &apos;s almost done .
stay with me , kyle . almost done .
you &apos;re okay .
give me a minute .
dr. shepherd , there isn &apos;t any --
she said give her a minute .
bleeding has stopped .
kyle , check your hand .
okay .
no tremor .
okay , can you ...
speak now ?
you miss me ?
welcome back , kyle .
i showed you my moves .
time to show us yours .
all right , come on .
your turn to free @-@ style .
this wasn &apos;t my fault .
telling the mother .
stress doesn &apos;t just cause arteries to rupture .
you know that .
i do .
doesn &apos;t make it right .
it felt right .
it felt like she needed to know ,
like it was the right thing to do .
i know the feeling .
this is not the same thing !
i &apos;m just saying that i know ...
how ...
you felt ...
in that moment .
i know .
turn around .
god bless your heart .
i &apos;m glad you told me ...
about jackson &apos;s father .
now you understand why i &apos;m doing this .
not a bit .
it was an awfully sad story .
but it was your story , not theirs ,
and stop trying to make it theirs .
i don &apos;t have a choice , richard .
the woman i married ...
believed in second chances ...
that anything was possible ...
and that the glass doesn &apos;t always have to be half empty .
and you said your ex @-@ husband
didn &apos;t know the woman he married .
well , i do .
i &apos;m only letting you yammer on
because your hands are so magical .
lower .
well , that &apos;s a start .
we had to remove your spleen to stop the bleeding .
but the baby &apos;s fine .
good fetal heartbeat , very strong .
and my mom ?
she &apos;s waiting to see you ...
whenever you &apos;re ready .
okay . warren .
is she okay ?
she is .
and the baby ?
they &apos;re both fine .
mom . don &apos;t speak .
listen .
this just ...
isn &apos;t what we do .
you tell me when you &apos;re in trouble .
you don &apos;t walk around scared and alone ,
not when you have me .
do you hear me ?
not when you &apos;re having my grandbaby .
listen , what i said before , that was just me being --
insecure .
i deserve that .
you could have said a lot worse .
i did -- earlier .
i &apos;m very sorry .
the attendings got out of their meeting .
already ? did you hear anything ?
i heard that penny applied ,
which is weird because she didn &apos;t say anything .
you applied ? when ?
today .
the deadline was at noon ,
and i decided i should at least try ,
even if i don &apos;t really have a chance .
oh , you have a chance .
alex told me that your name came up -- a lot .
actually , uh , grey had your back .
shepherd even .
shepherd ?
i just don &apos;t understand why you didn &apos;t tell us .
you pretended to be all cheerleader @-@ y .
it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s a little -- - snaky .
i wasn &apos;t trying to hide anything .
never saw it coming .
well played .
i wasn &apos;t playing anything .
i just decided -- - yeah . wow .
good luck .
on the 8th , he had ...
4.2 just to make s--
excuse me .
okay .
mate , this has to stop .
oh , you &apos;re right . this has to stop .
megan called me right before she ...
all right , she told me ...
everything .
so , yeah , you should just stop ...
&apos;cause i see you .
you can &apos;t do this .
you can &apos;t just come in here
and pretend to be some nice guy ,
pretend to be this hero and lie and fool everyone ,
like grey and bailey and pierce and amelia .
you can &apos;t just take more people away from me .
you can &apos;t do it , and i won &apos;t let you .
benjamin warren !
miranda bailey .
you didn &apos;t submit your application
for the preminger grant !
no . of course i didn &apos;t .
but what do you mean , &quot; of course &quot; ?
you &apos;re asking me - why i didn &apos;t apply for a grant
that &apos;s gonna take me across the country ?
w @-@ what , am i supposed to jump at the chance
to leave my wife and kid for a -- a year or more ?
but it was an incredible opportunity .
we could have figured something out .
you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not my turn .
not right now .
you &apos;re chief . we need to be here .
and you &apos;re okay with that ?
well , it &apos;ll be my turn sometime .
you know , and when it is , you &apos;ll , uh ...
you &apos;ll do the same for me .
right ?
come on .
so ...
who &apos;d you pick , chief ?
are you kidding me ?
it &apos;s me .
i read the e @-@ mail five times to see where i got it wrong ,
but i didn &apos;t .
i won .
bailey gave me the preminger grant .
are you kidding me ? !
why do you keep saying that ?
oh , no .
no , yeah . n-- well , it &apos;s just ...
yay , you !
come on , let &apos;s go celebrate .
you recommended blake ?
i recommended you .
well , then why did karev say you --
then blake &apos;s name came up from a few people .
they asked my opinion .
and what did you say ?
well , i &apos;m not gonna tell you what i said .
i gave an honest answer to a question .
you sunk me .
i endorsed you .
after that , it &apos;s out of my hands .
you have been trying to find a way
to get rid of her for months ,
and to use this , you go right past somebody
who you know deserves it more ...
someone who has been there for you ,
who stepped in when you couldn &apos;t even handle doing your job .
edwards .
this is the attendings &apos; lounge .
are you all right ?
am i all right ? yeah .
you lost that shine in your eyes .
i liked that shine .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m shiny .
all right , i just played a private concert for you
with my brain open .
i think you can give me something .
i got screwed over by a friend today . that &apos;s all .
the redhead ?
that sucks .
when i started playing ,
i had all these musician friends .
and , you know , we &apos;d hang , and we &apos;d jam together .
we grew up together , you know .
and then i started booking gigs , selling out those gigs ,
and , you know , - i had the fans and the girls ,
and it was fantastic .
it was everything we had hoped for .
it was -- it was everything we had talked about , you know ?
and then when i went to share it with them ...
they weren &apos;t there .
all my friends were gone .
poof . just like that .
but it turns out they weren &apos;t my friends .
they were my competition .
you and i are a lot alike .
okay , how is that ?
well , you &apos;re smart .
incredibly good @-@ looking .
cocky . -
but with the goods to back it up .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m gonna go to sleep ...
&apos;cause my head hurts .
i &apos;m supposed to watch you .
i &apos;m okay with that .
i had a crappy day .
mm , me too .
i found out why owen hates riggs .
i don &apos;t want to know .
okay .
do i want to know ?
i &apos;m here !
we can see that .
really ? with the cabinets ?
sorry .
you open , you close .
it &apos;s not that big a deal .
it &apos;s tedious .
oh , my god , i was promised sisters .
i just got you guys back in the same house .
i &apos;ve never had sisters . it &apos;s nice .
but it &apos;s going to implode .
you know it , and i know it .
so have at it .
go to town over the cabinets .
if you &apos;re gonna kill each other , just do it already .
i can &apos;t keep this family together by myself .
nobody asked you to .
we &apos;re adults . we &apos;re going to fight .
a lot .
i &apos;m annoying .
she is .
but i don &apos;t plan on kicking her out anytime soon .
so , are you good ?
i &apos;m not homeless .
i &apos;m good .
good .
though maggie is starting to get on my nerves .
agreed .
well , you wanted sisters .
you got &apos; em .
close the cabinet .
i was just on my way to your place .
i really don &apos;t have time for one of your lectures now , mom .
no , i was coming to say that i was sorry , to ...
... to apologize .
i doubt that .
no , let me finish .
i overstepped , but you are my baby ,
and if somebody messes with you , watch out .
i ...
well , i was just protecting my baby .
you know i &apos;m a grown @-@ ass man , right ?
language .
as long as i &apos;m living , my baby forever you will be .
but ...
i do need to let go .
roots , wings .
you can fight your own battles .
yes , i can .
and if you don &apos;t want to fight april on this ,
maybe there is another way .
i mean , we &apos;re still all family .
maybe you can go to counseling ,
or i could get the two of you in a room together ,
and we could -- -
sorry .
i -- this is gonna take some practice .
this ... -
honey , what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m an avery .
somebody messed with my baby , so i got myself some power .
i &apos;ll round on jenny in the morning after you &apos;ve been in .
all right , good night .
i think jackson &apos;s gonna sue me ...
for custody .
full custody once the baby &apos;s born .
his mother -- she is ... awful .
i overheard her saying it , and i just want to ...
i -- i am -- i am so ...
mad .
i am furious .
i feel like my skin is on fire !
oh , my god .
sorry . i know . i &apos;m ranting .
but i don &apos;t have anyone to talk to ,
and i need to talk to someone .
no !
and i &apos;ve been treating you like crap --
no no no no no you need to talk to me . it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m here -- for whatever you need , &apos; cause ...
we &apos;re friends .
rant away .
and then ...
we &apos;ll think about what to do .
i already thought of what to do .
i &apos;m not gonna be the victim .
he can &apos;t do this .
i won &apos;t let him .
april , what did you do ?
what happens when the gloves come off
and you stop hiding behind your mask ?
and i still won &apos;t want to hurt her .
you know , it &apos;s in my power not to , so ...
hey . here &apos;s to that .
do you need a drink ? -
hey ! dr. avery .
yeah .
dr. jackson avery ?
that &apos;s right . do we --
you &apos;ve been served .
have a good night , guys .
what &apos;s your next move ?
do you take your best shot and see where it lands ?
or do you hang back , wait a minute ,
and see if you get sucker @-@ punched ?
&quot; i don &apos;t want to fight .
whatever you want to do , we &apos;ll do . &quot;
it &apos;s your move .
oh , no .
a restraining order .
april filed a restraining order against me .
you can either retreat or go out swinging .
so , what you gonna do ?
