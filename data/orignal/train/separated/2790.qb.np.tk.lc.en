there was this incredible abyss and i &apos;m falling .

but i made it , &quot; if this woman doesn &apos;t get to a hospital ...
... she &apos;s not gonna live . &quot;

i don &apos;t think that will affect the plot of the show .
how can they do this to me ?
all right , i &apos;m just gonna go .
sorry .
well , it wasn &apos;t that many guys .
if you consider how many guys there actually are ...
... it &apos;s a very small percentage .
it &apos;s not that big a deal . i was just curious .
good night .
good night , richard .
good luck , mon .
before i tell you , you tell me how many women you &apos;ve been with .
two .
two ? two ?
how is that possible ? i mean ...
... have you seen you ?
i mean , what can i say ?
i was married to barbara for 30 years , my high @-@ school sweetheart .
now you . that &apos;s two .
two it is .
time for bed . i &apos;m gonna brush my teeth .
no , wait a minute now !
come on , it &apos;s your turn .
oh , come on !
you know , i don &apos;t need the actual number . just a ballpark .
okay , it is definitely less than a ballpark .
i am so glad i &apos;m not monica right now .
tell me about it .
so what &apos;s your magic number ?
come on , you know everyone i &apos;ve been with . all both of them .
well , there &apos;s you .
better not be doing these in order .
billy dreskin , pete carny .
barry .
paolo .
oh , yes , the weenie from turinie .
honey , are you jealous of paolo ?
i &apos;m so much happier with you than i ever was with him .
really ?
oh , please !
that paolo thing was barely a relationship .
all it really was was just meaningless , animal sex .
okay , you know , that sounded so much better in my head .
i didn &apos;t sleep with your ex @-@ girlfriend .
that &apos;s exactly what someone who slept with her would say .
this is nuts ! crazy ! she came over for two minutes ...
... dropped off a fish tank and left !
where &apos;s buddy ?
buddy ?
my fish , buddy .
there was no fish when she dropped it off .
this is unbelievable !
you sleep with my ex @-@ girlfriend , insult my intelligence by lying ...
... then you kill my fish ? my buddy ?
i didn &apos;t kill your fish !
look , eddie
would you look at what i &apos;m doing ?
now that can &apos;t be smart .
so we &apos;re just gonna take this guy right off you ...
... and put him here in mr. pocket .
tangelo ?
that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s the giant number you were afraid to tell me ?
well , that &apos;s not bad at all .
you had me thinking it was , like , a fleet .
you &apos;re okay with it ?
oh , honey , i &apos;m fine .
okay , about that two .
what ?
all right .
what about my two ?
it just seems like a really small number .
right .
don &apos;t you have a lot of wild oats to sow ?
or is that what you &apos;re doing with me ? oh , my god ! am i an oat ?
honey , you are not an oat .
i don &apos;t know , i guess i &apos;m just not an oat guy .
i &apos;ve only slept with women i love .
you &apos;ve only slept with two people .
right .
you know i love you too , right ?
now i do .
ross , please listen to me .
you are so much better for me than paolo ever was .
you care about me , you &apos;re loving , you make me laugh .
if i make you laugh , here &apos;s an idea .
invite paolo to have a romp in the sack ...
... and i &apos;ll stand in the corner and tell knock @-@ knock jokes !
what we have is special ! all paolo and i ever had was
&quot; animal sex &quot; ?
so what are you saying ?
there &apos;s nothing between us &quot; animal &quot; at all ?
there &apos;s not even , like , a little animal ?
not even , like ...
... chipmunk sex ?
try to hear me , okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you .
lt was good with paolo .
knock @-@ knock .
but what you and i have is so much better .
we have tenderness , we have intimacy , we connect .
you know ? i swear .
this is the best ...
... i have ever had .
until now .
richard told me he loved me .
oh , my god !
i know !
honey , that &apos;s great !
i know !
i just can &apos;t find
top drawer .
hurry .
why ? you need one too ?
found them !
there &apos;s only one .
we &apos;ll be right there . we &apos;re just trying to decide something .
they &apos;re trying to decide something .
good . good , good .
so was your mustache did it used to be different ?
how do you , you know , keep it so neat ?
i have a comb .
what is that ?
a mustache comb .
thank you .
okay , i will do your laundry for one month .
i will , i will , i will ....
i will clean the apartment for two months .
i &apos;ll give this to you now , if you tell me where we keep the dustpan .
so were you in nam ?
we are both adults here . right ? . there has to be a mature way to handle this .
rock , paper , scissors ?
gotcha .
one , two , three .
yes !
fine . go have sex .
no ! you have got it completely wrong !
john savage was deer hunter , no legs .
jon voight was coming home , couldn &apos;t feel his legs .
you &apos;ve got it totally the other way around , my friend . jon voight
honey ?
what ?
shall we ?
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
they &apos;re doing it tonight . we can do it tomorrow .
in the future , if i could see the schedule beforehand ....
so when i woke up this morning ...
... he &apos;d stolen all the insoles out of my shoes !
why ?
he thinks i slept with his ex @-@ girlfriend and killed his fish .
why would you kill his fish ?
because sometimes after you sleep with someone ...
... you have to kill a fish .
chandler , honey ...
... i &apos;m sorry .
can we watch joey &apos;s show now , please ?
wait . he &apos;s not here yet .
he knows what happens .
i &apos;m fine about my problem now , by the way .
amber ...
... i &apos;ll always be there for you ...
... as a friend and as your brother .
oh , drake .
hard day , huh ?
first the medical award , now this ?
some guys are just lucky , i guess .
dr. ramoray , report to first floor emergency stat .
well , then ...
... i guess that &apos;s me .
anyone else need to go on the elevator ? dr. horton ? dr. wall ?
they only said you .
oh , okay . all right .
i love you .
yeah , whatever .
oh , no !
drake , look out !
did they just kill off joey ?
no !
now maybe .
come on ! open up ! we want to talk to you !
i don &apos;t feel like talking !
come on ! we care about you .
we &apos;re worried about you .
and some of us really have to pee !
i &apos;m sorry , joey .
listen , sorry about your death . that really sucks .
we came over as soon as we saw .
how could you not tell us ?
i don &apos;t know . i was kind of hoping no one would ever find out .
well , maybe they could find a way to bring you back .
they said that when they found my body , my brain was so smashed in ...
... that the only doctor who could &apos;ve saved me was me .
it &apos;s supposed to be some kind of irony .
but joey , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
you don &apos;t need that show . it was just a dumb soap opera .
this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me .
yes ! i was going to incorporate that .
here &apos;s monica . she &apos;ll have something nice to say .
i straightened out your shower curtain so you won &apos;t get mildew .
what ? to me , that &apos;s nice .
it &apos;ll be okay . you know that .
no , i don &apos;t .
it &apos;s like you work your whole life for something ...
... and you think that when you get it ...
... it &apos;ll never be as good as you thought .
but this so was .
it changed everything .
like , the other day , i got this credit card application ...
... and i was pre @-@ approved !
i &apos;ve never been pre @-@ approved for anything in my life !
i &apos;m sorry , man .
i don &apos;t know if this &apos;ll mean anything to you ...
... but you &apos;ll always be pre @-@ approved with us .
that means nothing to me .
pecan sandy ? just made them .
yeah , all right .
are these raisins ?
sure , why not ?
listen , eddie .
i &apos;ve been thinking about our living situation .
why are you smiling ?
i got a little surprise . look . there &apos;s a new fishy .
i named him ...
... chandler , you know , after you .
well , that &apos;s not even a real fish .
no , that &apos;s a goldfish cracker .
so what &apos;s your point , man ?
okay , good night .
you big freak of nature !
brisk tonight .
oh , man .
