liz la cerva tried to commit suicide pills
what &apos;d she do that for ?
apparently she got a letter for ade from the salvation army
ade &apos;s homeless ?
she made a donation every year
to feed the homeless on thanksgiving
the letter set liz off evidently
look i gotta say i commiserate with the woman but
she thinks her daughter is dead
i told you i had another dream about ade in paris
a french policeman told me she was dead and i had to tell her
i know carm pepe le pew
doesn &apos;t change the fact that adrianna is missing
it also doesn &apos;t change the fact that her mother &apos;s a bitter lush
who can &apos;t accept reality
what reality ?
that her daughter couldn &apos;t stand her so she moved away
that &apos;s what you say to me two weeks
after our own daughter moves away to california
oh come on will you stop ? it &apos;s a different situation entirely
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m sorry it &apos;s just
it &apos;s just everything all at once

i rushed in with her i thought i wanted it
you do and you &apos;re not giving it a chance
you &apos;ll see eventually you &apos;ll want kids it &apos;ll be good
i don &apos;t want a family with her
she &apos;s got no idea who i am
she &quot; doesn &apos;t understand you &quot; ?
as we know phil asked me to arrange this meeting
after the fire in his wire room
correction you asked me to fuckin &apos; attend
i agreed
fair enough
now i won &apos;t call it a sit @-@ down because
of the inclement negative implications
let &apos;s think of it as a meeting of minds
now for whatever reason certain incidents
have expired lately that in addition to being dangerous
could have an adverse impact on our respective bottom lines
i know vito &apos;s bottom was impacted if that &apos;s what you &apos;re referring to
call him what you will but you &apos;re talkin &apos; about one of my captains
captain ? the good ship lollipop right ?
phil please
please my ass
the man was a fuckin &apos; disgrace
well before he came out of the closet
he worked for me and he put a lot of money in my pocket
and yours too
talk about earners ? how about fat dom gamiello ?
what about him ?
he &apos;s mia
a lot of people are concerned for his well @-@ being
so what the fuck would i know about that ?
well as coincidence would have it he was last seen in new jersey
so was the hindenburg maybe you wanna look into that too
tony please phil
we &apos;re getting off point
i grew up in this guys
and i just lost my friend rusty
and for reasons i will discern in time believe me
if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me it &apos;s this
a pint of blood costs more than a gallon of gold
my business all of our businesses
this infighting &apos;s costing money
i &apos;m willing to move forward
let the past be bygones
fine with me
a wise decision
on both your parts
now what i &apos;d love to see is a truce
wipe the slate clean
the no @-@ shows the wire room vito put it all behind us
yeah
your brother billy whatever happened there
all right then
&quot; whatever happened there ? &quot;
the shooting
&quot; whatever happened there ? &quot;
god rest his soul huh ?
i &apos;ll tell you what fuckin &apos; happened
without any provocation whatsoever !
my cousin &apos;s dead
fuck you !
phil we were making headway here i didn &apos;t mean to say
fuck what you meant cocksucker !
come on
jesus christ carmine what the fuck ?
why would you possibly bring that up ?
he &apos;s holdin &apos; the board looking the other way
so the nail gun goes off bam !
right through the dude &apos;s cheek
oh fuck
passaic
what ?
where i live you asked me
right
why you ask me that ? you gonna come over take me on a date ?
yeah absolutely
i got a son hector
he &apos;s three
ah that &apos;s cool
you &apos;re gonna call me right ?
hey there &apos;s only six numbers
i left the last one off
you wanna find me you &apos;re gonna have to work for it
you have an emergency call on two
oh my god pop ?
guess who
that &apos;s not funny
had to get your attention
well you had my attention now you &apos;re wasting my time i have to go
hold on you got a warehouse listed on panama
that used to be a uniform supply what &apos;s the asking ?
three and a quarter can i go now ?
i was driving by i thought it had some potential
but it &apos;s really 9400 square feet
of leaky tarpaper roofs and clotted galvanized plumbing
and no foot traffic to speak of
ease up on the hard sell there
i &apos;m thinking
you get the seller to knock something meaningful off the asking
i fix it you flip it
look whatever happened we did make some money together right ?
you serious about this ?
oh you never do shit like that ?
i &apos;ll get back to you
i was up for anything
he signed the escrow papers
and i &apos;m not sure what happened
but he left
it was so fucking humiliating
and i was so worked up i just needed to smooth it out
so there &apos;s the cristal
i mean it could &apos;ve been worse given my history
it could &apos;ve been junk
julie right ?
julianna
christopher
i liked your share in there seriously
i &apos;m glad or sorry i guess
got a similar situation with my job
i really get that rush when it &apos;s working
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever heard you share in there
not a judgment by the way
you learn as much from others
i split my time at na too
junk &apos;s another thing huh ?
tell me about it
you look familiar
pork store there satriale &apos;s
oh right
wow cool so i guess i &apos;ll see you
or maybe next week here
wait you wanna go for coffee ?
well okay
wanna follow me to that dive on sip and jfk ?
that comes the abraham lincoln -where you been ?
linda merola &apos;s
who &apos;s the successful president
i left you a message the annual christmas toy drive
how was it ?
it was nice we gave an xbox
so stan klimik was there
ruth &apos;s husband ? he works for kroll
the private eyes ?
he does their computers
anyway i was telling him about ade
and he said we should hire professionals to track her down
carm
it &apos;s not as expensive as you might think tony
he gave me his card
look it &apos;s not about the money
did you ever think that maybe it &apos;s an intrusion into ade &apos;s personal life ?
but what if she &apos;s in trouble tony ?
stan said they had this case once
this guy ran out on his child support
he was a hiking enthusiast missing 12 years
and they tracked him down to a watering station in the mojave desert
carmela &apos;s spec house ? i need you to go lean on that building inspector
leave it alone you said
do it today for all our sakes
my wife needs a career
tony hey season &apos;s greetings
good holidays to your family huh ?
yeah you too
well it &apos;s bigger than i thought
i got close with a developer who thought he could do apartments
some light retail but we snagged on some zoning issues
let me worry about that
so who &apos;s this fianc ? you were telling me about ?
jesus what the fuck do you want here ?
just move on huh ?
i was confused okay ?
i &apos;m not now
what a coincidence
cause that &apos;s exactly how i feel
take all the time you need just stick it in the lock box
it &apos;s only the latest draft
guy who wrote it i met him at a meeting
jt dolan big user
you can tell it &apos;s relentless
yeah it &apos;s a work in progress
i didn &apos;t mean it like that there &apos;s a lot in it
are you sure about the title &quot; cleaver &quot; ?
the jerry mathers connection ?
rules of success for pictures like this ?
one @-@ word titles &quot; saw &quot; &quot; hostel &quot; &quot; cleaver &quot;
but michael he knows it &apos;s the boss right away ?
you might want to make more of a mystery out of it
maybe
this boss he &apos;s a really rough
is anthony soprano like that ?
he &apos;s just a jumping @-@ off point for the character
he &apos;s got some similarness
like he thinks everything &apos;s his
but it &apos;s not
i can &apos;t get into it but there are some rules
thank you don &apos;t get into it i don &apos;t wanna know
it &apos;s just weird you know ? being where he &apos;s been
he hasn &apos;t been anywhere
nothing happened i told you that
don &apos;t matter he &apos;s been there in his mind
ugh fine
you &apos;re right guy &apos;s got a lot more on his mind than this
like whether or not to have that third sandwich
i &apos;m not a fucking parking spot
ow
don &apos;t get me wrong i loved dom more than anybody
my point is we don &apos;t know if tony was behind this
it was payback for vito
so why the fuck did they blow up the wire room ?
the balls on this prick
to blow up a store you call that balls ?
balls is you look a guy in the eye
while you jam an ice pick through his lung
i meant balls as in &quot; nerve &quot; &quot; gall &quot;
i know what the fuck you meant
far as i &apos;m concerned this is like 9 @-@ 11
tony wanted our attention fine
he got our attention now we wipe him off the planet
you know that fat cocksucker says i look like the shah of iran ?
who does ?
tony
i never got that at all
fat piece of shit
it &apos;s irrelevant phil but he &apos;s testin &apos; you all the time
and you keep indulging him
you &apos;re right
but whack a boss ? i won &apos;t do that
it &apos;s been done before
and it was wrong then
eye for an eye then huh ? pick somebody over there
white trash motherfuckers in narcotics anonymous
the fuck with your whining tonight ?
listen been involved with this girl
in there that &apos;s the place to share
it &apos;s complicated
remember that real estate agent tony was dealing with ? the jewish one ?
fuckin &apos; a he planted the flag i &apos;d back off
no he didn &apos;t do shit she said
he wanted to and then never pulled the trigger
okay it &apos;s touchy but okay
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s okay but fuck him and what he don &apos;t know you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
she &apos;s in recovery junk
her ? fuckin &apos; movie of the week

beginning with the feast ? how hard you had to work to get back from that ?
civilians their bosses find out they slipped
they get a plane ticket to minnesota
tony will fuckin &apos; mulch his roses with what &apos;s left of you
she &apos;s solid now years sober
we fuckin &apos; met at a meeting
that never happens to me
that &apos;s all you got to say ?
schools of thought two of you together
could be enabling bad habits shared
but it &apos;s more like she knows how bad it is
we watch out for each other
she wouldn &apos;t even let me have red bull seriously
well that &apos;s the other school two are stronger than one
i know i &apos;m different with her
well i guess we just keep an eye on it
you fuckin &apos; lucky cocksucker
another married man ?
i know
and it gets worse i think he &apos;s connected
to what ?

he &apos;s still up on his cross huh ?
junior you shot him
yeah well it &apos;s not that simple
i know a few things you don &apos;t
like maybe i wasn &apos;t acting alone
junior jfk was 40 years ago
that &apos;s all i &apos;ll say about that
you see that one over there ?
an attorney i &apos;m mounting my case
look i should take off
you want a snack ? a soda ?

happy holidays
here
one hand washes the other
so the husband says &quot; i wasn &apos;t talkin &apos; to you &quot;
you know her ?
oh that &apos;s right you and her
how &apos;d that all go ?
i had to put her on the shelf
yeah she &apos;s a friend of kaisha the black one i was tellin &apos; you about
she was just now asking what to get kaisha for her birthday
what &apos;d you tell her ?
luther vandross a box set
mmm
mmm
you know what &apos;s interesting ?
hmm ?
us being able to use again
but integrating it into our lives
yeah
work
socialize
but still having a mastery
not easy
but interesting as shit
for one thing we don &apos;t use needles
i should probably tell tony we &apos;re fucking
what ? we &apos;re not anymore
he &apos;s already hinky
he starts pokin &apos; around
finds out we met in aa
he could suspect i &apos;m usin &apos; again
hmm
and ruin everything
you heard that phil had surgery now ?
turds in the aorta a medical first
gotta see my chiropodist
t
there &apos;s something i should tell you
the real estate agent
yeah ?
i &apos;ve been bangin &apos; her
see i knew some shit was goin &apos; on
why the fuck did you lie to me ?
i wasn &apos;t sure how it ended with you two
till you set me straight
stupid right ?
point is i want everything above boards
as always between you and me
i don &apos;t give a fuck
do what you want with her
this is my reward
your reward
i do not betray my wife
i go out of my way not to have an affair with this woman
this very hot
very beautiful intelligent woman
cause of the way carmela nursed me and cared for me
and my fuckin &apos; turkey @-@ neck of a nephew
winds up with his dick in there
a guy i gotta see every day
this is my reward
frankly i &apos;m encouraged
with the fuckin &apos; riddles again
i sat here dreading the end of the story
would involve you erupting
in some act of violence towards your nephew
well christmas isn &apos;t over yet
you came out of that shooting
feeling each day is a &quot; gift &quot;
well this is a corollary to that
a what ?
you don &apos;t have to eat every dish of rigatoni
you don &apos;t have to fuck every female you meet
you know what i &apos;ve been realizing ?
these women they &apos;re all sort of the same
dark complexion smart
they smell a little bit of money
there &apos;s you and gloria
and this &quot; ashkenuzi &quot;
so what &apos;s that about ?
what do you think it &apos;s about ?
well ... ahem
it &apos;s probably the reason i still come here
to hang out with you
&apos;cause nothing really changes with the therapy part
ton &apos; ? that fed &apos;s out front harris
says he wants you to know he &apos;s here having a sandwich
what &apos;s the matter ? not enough mayo ?
tony how you doing ?
good so how &apos;s the war on terror ?
christmas is always potentially our busy season
so phil leotardo huh ? coronary ?
i swear to god i had nothin &apos; to do with that
just so you know
i &apos;m still in touch with some agents who work o c
from what they hear you &apos;re not very popular in brooklyn right now
so what else is new huh ?
that someone close to you may be in danger
really ? anybody specific ?
all they know is it &apos;s under serious discussion at top levels
thanks
it &apos;s christmas
what ? you want me to call a doctor ?
cramping in my legs ? it could be anything
well then what &apos;d you call me for ?
just to say hi
but you &apos;re all right ?
yeah i &apos;ll see you later
bring me home a quattro formaggi
i don &apos;t care what time it is wake me up
all right
mwah
we were talking about recovery
and your organized crime thing
that i took an oath
that was a sacred oath
that &apos;s not an urban legend ?
no you burn a saint you draw blood
but technically i shouldn &apos;t even be tellin &apos; you this
ooh
the program
i could never really get into the &quot; higher power &quot; part
well me neither it &apos;s hard
i mostly think of the group consciousness as a higher power
i said to myself that that oath would be my higher power
that would be my strength
that code ... that &apos;s a soldier &apos;s oath
i could see that
but the problem is nobody lives it no more
not tony not nobody
they let you down
whatever ... here i am
using
using
are you breaking up with me ?
no
should we go to a meeting ?
i don &apos;t know
what do you wanna do ?
i know one that starts in half an hour in glen ridge
take one car ?
i &apos;ll follow you
you should &apos;ve called first
how &apos;s john ?
some christmas present huh ?
i &apos;ll see you in the morn
i &apos;ll see you in the morning
god loves you
finally got you to come to brooklyn cocksucker

but while i was in that coma
somethin &apos; happened to me
i went someplace

believe me nobody ever laid on their deathbed
wishin &apos; they saved more no @-@ show jobs
now you take your time
you get better
and you get out of this fuckin &apos; place
but when you do you focus on grandkids
and good things
we can have it all phil
