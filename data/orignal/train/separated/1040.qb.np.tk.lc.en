i moved your portion of the treasure out of the country .
it &apos;s still worth more than either of us
could ever spend in a lifetime .
i don &apos;t want to run anymore , moz .
i &apos;m -- - agent kramer .
head of the bureau &apos;s d.c. art crimes unit .
so you &apos;re the one who taught peter everything he knows .
neal is my c.i ..
he &apos;s also a friend .
&quot; the u.s. probation office is convening a hearing
to discuss the commutation of your sentence . &quot;
you could be a free man .
you &apos;ve already served two years of a four @-@ year sentence
while confined to a tracking anklet .
i won &apos;t be going anywhere anytime soon .
this is my home now .
caffrey &apos;s got a lot of secrets .
but if i keep digging ,
who knows what will turn up ?
if kramer digs up these things ...
neal could get the maximum .
he could go back to prison .
for a long , long time .
you &apos;re covering for him .
you box him in , he &apos;s gonna run .
these marshals are here to take neal caffrey
and he &apos;ll work for me in d.c. permanently .
you understand this is best for everyone , don &apos;t you ?
i do know that he has a good heart .
do you think mr. caffrey is reformed ?
as long as he &apos;s on that anklet , we &apos;ll never know .
as long as we treat him like a criminal ,
he &apos;ll always think that he is one .
should neal caffrey &apos;s sentence be commuted ?
yes . neal should be free .
i &apos;m saying neal should be free .
i can tell you one thing .
i won &apos;t be going anywhere anytime soon .
peter caffrey &apos;s cut his anklet .
neal &apos;s gone .
that person you saw on roosevelt island --
who was it ?
e. parker , witness protection .
when this is over ...
i &apos;ll tell you everything .
kramer thinks you know more than you &apos;re saying .
until the dust settles , keep your head down ,
close some cases , and forget about neal caffrey .
peter .
peter .
jones . hey .
what &apos;d you bring me ? work @-@ up on another mail fraud .
foreign lottery ?
magazine sweepstakes .
oh , variety -- spice of life .
is this where caffrey sat ?
who &apos;s that at neal &apos;s desk ?
no idea .
well , it looks like he knows you .
he &apos;s got quite the swagger , doesn &apos;t he ?
you didn &apos;t blink first , did you ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ve been invited to the party .
peter , this is agent kyle collins .
he &apos;s with o.i.a.
what brings the office of international affairs to white collar ?
neal caffrey .
it &apos;s been six weeks ,
and the bureau hasn &apos;t turned up one lead
on its poster boy for reform ,
which is why caffrey needs to be captured
and locked away for a long , long time .
as you &apos;re aware , we &apos;ve got agents
flipping over every mattress caffrey &apos;s ever slept on .
but those other agents aren &apos;t peter burke .
i &apos;ve given my statements .
everything i know about neal is in the file .
everything that &apos;s official , maybe .
but agent kramer seems to think
that you may have left out the good stuff .
kramer sent you .
you know , he shed quite a bit of light
on your relationship with caffrey .
agent collins , if burke says it &apos;s all there ,
it &apos;s all there .
&quot; neal caffrey has 27 known aliases ,
speaks eight languages ,
including conversational swahili .
he &apos;d avoid countries with extradition . &quot;
that &apos;s helpful .
&quot; he has a weakness for beautiful women and ... &quot;
i love this bit of insight .
&quot; he runs . &quot;
yes , he does .
are we done here ?
no .
agent burke , i &apos;m gonna find neal caffrey .
and you &apos;re gonna help me do it .
buenos dias , rodrigo .
senor maine !
esta listo ?
sí . senor maine . esta listo .
that &apos;s what i need .
thank you .
here you go .
thank you .
hey , you didn &apos;t pay for that !
for his papayas , hector .
oh , thank you , senor .
see you in a little bit , buddy .
okay .
pardoname , usted conoce &quot; mi velero &quot; ?
sí ?
sigueme .
buenos dias , maya .
oh . hello , again , new york .
&quot; mi valero . &quot;
that &apos;s the last time i tell you one of my favorites .
that almost sounds like regret --
something you said you didn &apos;t believe in .
after a few caipirinhas , i say a lot of things .
oh , your usual table has ears .
oh , barry ? he &apos;s harmless .
he wants to unionize my servers .
viva healthcare !
more or less harmless .
say yes to dinner tonight .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to work .
you &apos;re the proprietor .
i like you , james . i do .
but men like you are trouble .
men like me ?
men who come here to escape their past .
i think you &apos;re confusing me
with the guy who steals hector &apos;s papayas .
and if you are , i &apos;m offended .
estoy tambien .
so you &apos;re an honest man who has nothing to hide .
open book .
you &apos;re from new york . that &apos;s all you &apos;ve told me .
it &apos;s the best city in the world .
then why &apos;d you leave ?
to live here .
in paradise .
i &apos;m sorry , new york .
your open book is a work of fiction .
maya , come on .
one moment of honesty . that &apos;s all i &apos;m asking .
maybe then i &apos;ll consider dinner .
if it isn &apos;t barry soetoro-- carefree treasure hunter .
just so i &apos;m clear , you can have any woman you want ,
and the one woman you choose
is the only woman in the entire archipelago
who doesn &apos;t want you .
you have your pursuits , i have mine .
well , she has no reason to assume we &apos;re hiding anything .
except the fact that this island has no u.s. extradition treaty
and we showed up with limitless wealth .
you miss it ?
of course .
but what &apos;s regret gonna get me ?
nothing .
and you &apos;re james maine -- rich , carefree island resident .
neal caffrey , on the other hand , is--
is a wanted fugitive .
too bad the fbi won &apos;t forget that .
第四季第一集
he digs in milos ,
sparta maybe .
you know , there &apos;s nothing in his file
about an affinity for greek philosophy .
&apos;cause you &apos;re not gonna find neal studying trinkets .
and why is that ?
he disappears through reinvention .
the man you &apos;re looking for isn &apos;t the one who sat at that desk .
the day caffrey fled ,
you said you followed him to roosevelt island .
you claimed you didn &apos;t know why he was there or who he met with ,
and yet you had agent clinton jones
flag the name e. parker ,
but you failed to mention the part about e. parker
in any of your official statements .
we couldn &apos;t confirm the details .
you tried to go through witsec ?
no help .
i &apos;ll let you know if that &apos;s true .
did you leave out anything else ?
he likes tanduay rhum .
nope . i &apos;ve got people on the ground in the philippines .
then clearly you know more than i do .
that &apos;s a shame .
i liked picturing neal and moz
touring the coconut palace .
well , if collins has his way ,
you can start picturing neal in sing sing .
that &apos;s if he &apos;s lucky .
you want me to kick collins &apos; ass ?
six weeks .
six weeks of chasing down leads .
el , he &apos;s my responsibility .
if anything were to happen to him ...
honey , kramer backed you into a corner .
you had to let neal go . you know that .
yeah , and now i know that
collins has access to witsec .
he &apos;s got a leg up .
you still think this e. parker knows where neal went ?
my gut &apos;s telling me that parker is the key to all of this .
and you don &apos;t think you can get to parker first ?
no .
you know , but maybe i could come in a close second .
by following collins .
yeah , if parker knows where neal is ,
maybe i can warn him that collins is coming .
well , that &apos;s a big &quot; if . &quot;
yeah . right now that &apos;s all i have .
and if all else fails ,
you can kick collins &apos; ass .
you know , most normal people make sand castles out of sand .
when have you ever considered us normal people , moz ?
your point ?
language is fluid .
so is your linen shirt .
all right . you mind hanging out while i change ?
or i could go meet dobbs by myself ,
save you the trouble .
we &apos;re paying the guy 25 grand a month for safe haven .
i think that &apos;s earned me some face time .
as you know ,
i vetted a lot of locations for our final refuge ,
and with our very specific demands
for lifestyle and security , it &apos;s a short list .
big enough to blend in , small enough to limit exposure .
i know , moz .
if we cross dobbs in any way ,
our only other option is isla paradiso .
sounds nice .
it &apos;s a leper colony !
and contrary to popular opinion ,
i do not have the compassion of jesus .
i &apos;ll be a saint .
oh , i got this for dobbs .
and this would be ?
a good first impression .
it looks like dobbs is doing okay for himself .
he &apos;s got the whole island wired .
clearly .
she &apos;s beautiful .
this one took me almost a year .
half the challenge is finding materials
this far from the mainland .
mr. dobbs , i &apos;d like to introduce you
to my associate , james maine .
mr. maine .
the names we choose can be very telling .
where does yours come from ?
the u.s.s. maine .
didn &apos;t the maine shipwreck in rough seas ?
suffice it to say ,
it wasn &apos;t a planned retirement .
thought you might appreciate a new canvas .
look at this .
dimple whiskey . 1935 .
not easy to come by in these parts . how &apos;d you find it ?
well , how we emptied it is the better story .
i &apos;m sure it is .
i assume you have something else for me ?
built all these yourself ?
i &apos;ve been on this island almost 20 years .
it &apos;s important to have hobbies .
well , i have to admit ,
i don &apos;t know much about ships in bottles .
well , planning is critical .
when all the pieces are set ,
it only takes one pull of the string to bring them to life .
but if all the pieces aren &apos;t perfectly linked together--
it all collapses .
i &apos;ve ... heard this story before .
paradise comes at a price , mr. maine .
you pull the strings .
and i keep everything tied together .
please have a seat .
25 grand-- what assurances does this guarantee us ?
it assures you the local law enforcement
won &apos;t divulge your presence here ,
nor will they hassle you .
if you have any disputes ,
problems , issues , bring them to me .
extradition or not , this money guarantees
that we stay invisible to the outside world .
that &apos;s right .
i only ask that you respect the sanctity of the island .
and if i have concern , i come to you .
anytime , day or night .
but i doubt he &apos;ll have any .
but i do .
please don &apos;t .
there &apos;s a boy in town-- hector .
he runs a fruit stand .
one of your men has been taking his papayas
without paying for them .
from now on , brody will pay for his papayas .
and the ones he &apos;s already taken ?
i &apos;ll see to it the boy is compensated .
all right .
then i think we will be very happy here .
excellent .
papayas ? seriously ?
it &apos;s about justice , moz .
and if a certain cafe girl
gets wind of your little good deed ?
added bonus .
just so you know ,
hector makes a killing off that fruit stand .
think about that the next time you give me an embolism .
gentlemen ... it &apos;s been a pleasure .
perfect timing . collins is in there now .
e. parker ?
female . mid @-@ to late @-@ 50s .
what &apos;d you bring me ?
deviled ham .
oh , neal hated this .
that &apos;s because he had a nose .
what ?
nothing .
oh , stakeouts with neal were the worst .
how so ?
well , he &apos;d--
he &apos;d always want to listen to public radio
or talk about chiaroscuro in roman imperial manuscripts .
you miss him .
yeah . yeah , right .
especially the way he &apos;d run off after i told him not to .
drove me crazy .
you know , if it makes you feel better ,
i could come up with an excuse
to get out of the car and go eavesdrop on collins by ...
i don &apos;t know , zip @-@ lining across the drainage pipe
with grappling hooks made out of expensive forzieri ties .
it might make me feel a little better .
you &apos;re the best wife ever . you know that .
look at that . rejected .
no . i &apos;ve got nothing to say to you .
man on deck .
actually , i was on deck .
now i &apos;m up to bat , technically .
ah . right .
the best wife ever would have known that , wouldn &apos;t she ?
she would .
good luck .
thanks .
ms. parker , my name is peter burke . i was--
i know who you are , and i &apos;ve already told your partner
i &apos;ve got nothing to say .
agent collins and i aren &apos;t partners .
i &apos;m neal &apos;s friend .
you need something more original than good cop / bad cop .
i &apos;ve played that game myself , and you &apos;re not very good at it .
no , i &apos;m trying to help him .
were you trying to help him
when you locked him up the first time ?
i was , but that --
then i &apos;m pretty confident he doesn &apos;t want your help now .
ms. parker , i don &apos;t think you understand what -- no .
come , missus ! this way !
where are we going , hector ?
surprise .
don &apos;t tell me the guy who steals hector &apos;s papayas
offers you wine and chocolate .
out of nowhere , he paid hector back today .
i wonder if you have anything to do with that .
i &apos;m flattered that you think i would .
come on . i &apos;ll show you the view .
right this way .
here .
how did you do this ?
plaster molds and a lot of sand .
it &apos;s the view from my old building .
this is amazing .
why ?
i &apos;ll never be an open book ,
but new york was a pretty big chapter .
are you going to be honest about it ?
you asked me for a moment of honesty .
i &apos;m gonna give you 20 .
20 ?
20 questions .
so generous of you .
well , i &apos;m a generous guy .
ask me anything you want about my life there .
anything ?
anything .
okay .
honesty .
do you miss it ?
everyday .
i lived there off and on since i was 18 , so ...
why did you go there ?
i had to leave the place i was from .
where was that ?
st. louis , but that &apos;s not a new york question .
tricky .
okay , then , it doesn &apos;t count .
all right . okay .
did you know anyone when you arrived ?
not a soul .
who was your first friend ?
barry .
he doesn &apos;t look like a barry .
do i look like a james ?
that &apos;s why i call you &quot; new york . &quot;
i can live with that .
are you alone ?
yeah .
what &apos;s going on .
well , i made a grappling hook out of forzieri ties .
it &apos;s ... you .
call me ellen .
for the record , your wife does a very good &quot; good cop . &quot;
yes , she does .
ellen ...
we need to talk about neal .
he doesn &apos;t know it yet , but he needs our help .
i &apos;m curious .
what exactly did neal tell you about me ?
nothing . not even a name .
you were neal &apos;s father &apos;s partner .
you talk the talk . partners are like family .
that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
agent burke , i don &apos;t mean to be rude ,
but i &apos;m in witsec for a good reason .
i &apos;m not so sure this was a good idea .
i &apos;m sorry to have wasted your time .
i gave neal the signal to run .
the day of his commutation hearing ,
the day he would have gone free ,
an agent with a grudge
decided neal didn &apos;t deserve that freedom ,
so he was gonna be hauled off for life .
prison ... an anklet in d.c. --
something that he didn &apos;t deserve .
so i gave him the signal to run .
you set him free ?
and now he &apos;s out there somewhere .
and the other agent who came to you --
agent collins ?
he won &apos;t stop ...
until he brings neal back -- alive or ...
or otherwise .
ellen , if anything were to happen to him , i ...
i don &apos;t think i could live with it .
i sent neal out into the world once .
told him a truth he wasn &apos;t ready to handle .
six years ago , when the feds were closing in on him ,
neal and i exchanged pagers .
in case something happened ,
we &apos;d use them like emergency flares .
ellen , you won &apos;t regret this .
protect our boy .
ellen ?
hi , neal .
guess this makes you 3 and 0 .
2 and 1 . haven &apos;t found you yet .
ellen gave you the pager number ?
yeah .
yeah , she sends her best .
i &apos;m sure . what do you know ?
neal , the d.o.j. has got someone looking for you .
well , if they didn &apos;t , i &apos;d be insulted .
he means business .
&quot; he &quot; meaning &quot; you &quot; ?
no .
then i &apos;m not worried .
how bad did i leave things for you ?
eh , the bureau beat me up a little ,
but i &apos;m handling it .
and elizabeth ?
she &apos;s good .
the agent who is after you , his name is collins .
he &apos;s with the office of international affairs .
he &apos;s dangerous .
and he won &apos;t stop until he finds you .
i &apos;m safe here .
and i &apos;m happy .
we had a good run .
it &apos;s not over .
yeah , it is .
you &apos;re an fbi agent . i &apos;m a con man .
there are only a few ways this could have ended .
this is one of the best .
right .
you understand this has to be the last time .
new york and i are done .
i get it .
please watch out for collins .
i will .
it &apos;s good to hear your voice .
yeah . you too .
goodbye , peter .
goodbye , neal .
thanks for coming . any sign of collins ?
not since yesterday .
my friend in quantico slipped the recording
to the digital evidence exploitation unit .
she isolated three distinct background elements of neal &apos;s call .
listen .
church bells .
four in a row . there &apos;s more .
ocean tides . rhythmic .
they were audible during the call .
listen to that fourth wave again .
it &apos;s off rhythm .
it &apos;s not a wave . it &apos;s thunder .
all right .
we &apos;ve got church bells and a storm .
it &apos;s a start , right ?
all right . i &apos;ll make the coffee .
bienvenue .
bienvenue .
i did some precursory digging into this collins .
what &apos;d you find ?
well , think dog the bounty hunter ,
sans the bleached mullet and bel esprit .
seems he &apos;d rather bring home his captures
in body bags than not at all .
the call was untraceable .
the beeper and the burner phone
are in the bottom of the atlantic -- it &apos;s done .
you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure , moz .
good .
vitamin &quot; c &quot;
morning .
hey . you &apos;re up .
can i get you some breakfast ?
thanks . i should get over to the caf .
can i see you tonight ?
i &apos;d like that very much .
see you , barry .
setting down roots .
spicy ones at that . i support this .
a hard beginning maketh a good ending .
i &apos;ll have hector keep an eye out for collins ,
just to be safe .
to good endings .
yes . good endings .
the call came in at midnight .
the bells rang four times .
let &apos;s assume it was 4 : 00 p.m. where neal was .
vanuatu --
waves , churches , no extradition -- it works .
ah , it &apos;s no good .
the only storm activity at 4 : 00 p.m.
in utc plus @-@ 11 occurred up near vladivostok , russia .
yeah , mozzie is afraid of bears . let &apos;s try 4 : 00 a.m.
a little early for church .
no , not necessarily .
i served my tour near a chamorro village in guam .
local chapel had a 4 : 00 a.m. service
for the fishermen who went out before dawn
puts him in utc minus @-@ 1 .
cape verde islands .
no extradition .
isolated thunderstorms throughout the atlantic ,
but , i mean , there must be dozens of tiny islands .
diana , what about the bells ?
well , analysis says they were spanish brass ,
but the islands in that area
were colonized by portugal , not spain .
dead end .
we need spanish bells .
wait a second . i think i may have something .
in 1798 , a bell was dredged from the wreckage
of a spanish ship named the rrinidad .
it was hung in the church of st. christopher
in the port city of santa maria
on the northernmost coast of cape verde .
and you got to love the internet ,
because i have a tourist video with the bells ringing .
diana ?
already on it .
yes !
you got to love the sound of spanish brass !
we got him !
what now ?
go back to the office
and figure out a way to bring neal home .
elizabeth burke ?
yes .
agent collins .
my husband &apos;s actually at the office .
i know .
well , then , what are you doing here ?
my job .
you can &apos;t just walk in like this .
does agent hughes know about this ?
he will .
i &apos;m calling my husband .
sir , take a look at this .
no need to bother your husband , mrs. burke .
i found what i was looking for .
collins was in my house .
he had absolutely no right to be there .
he had every right .
you were withholding information on caffrey &apos;s whereabouts .
i was speculating on my free time .
i saw the map . you circled cape verde .
is he there ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think so .
collins ?
he was on the first flight to cape verde .
does he have jurisdiction ?
no .
then how do you think he &apos;s gonna bring neal back ?
caffrey &apos;s fate is out of your hands , peter .
i don &apos;t accept that .
well , you better .
pending review of the situation ,
i &apos;ve been instructed to put you on leave .
do yourself a favor .
use this time to get some perspective .
think about what &apos;s important .
if you decide it &apos;s caffrey ...
i understand , but i can &apos;t protect you .
do you understand ?
completely .
senor maine , senor soetoro !
i think i saw that man at the aeropuerto !
he fit the description ?
solo americano in a diplomatic line .
had very small luggage .
tiene su la foto ?
si si si i have one .
this sure looks like his file photo .
how did he find us ?
peter said he was good .
good work , hector .
thank you .
keep eyes .
okay . i keep eyes .
thank you , hector .
don &apos;t worry .
we have maybe 24 hours . what do you want to do ?
what choice do i have ? this island &apos;s burned .
collins is making his way to santa maria .
we &apos;re on borrowed island time .
say goodbye to the last traces of james maine .
even though they &apos;re forgeries , this still hurts .
i really thought i was done running this time .
we should get to the airport .
moz .
collins is only after me . you don &apos;t have to go .
you run , i run . that &apos;s the deal .
then let &apos;s run .
pardona .
como puedo llegar a santa cristobal ?
ah , si , the church ?
si the church .
muchas gracias .
hola .
hey . buenos dias , senor .
are you looking for a particular type of hat ?
no .
actually , i &apos;m , i &apos;m looking for a friend .
senor maine .
yes , senor maine . yes .
skinny brim , about 25 vueltas ,
classic ribbon .
senor maine loves the classics .
do you know where i can find him ?
he also loves coffee .
come .
you see ?
coffee .
his biggest weakness .
gracias .
you have a good day , sir .
so , what brings you to the island ?
i &apos;m looking for a friend .
dark hair , i think blue eyes . he &apos;s annoyingly persuasive .
maybe you &apos;ve seen him .
nope .
it &apos;s collins !
12 : 00 .
has he done something ?
not at all . i owe him an apology .
it &apos;s a long way to come to say you &apos;re sorry .
he &apos;s a good friend . he &apos;s worth it .
looky here . agent burke .
never mind . i &apos;m sure you haven &apos;t seen him .
i wonder .
what could you be doing so far from home on a tiny island ?
i imagine the same thing that brought you here .
getting the best orange grogue for the price .
you know , it took me a day
to find caffrey &apos;s island hangout .
what &apos;d it take you -- five minutes ?
something like that .
the suit &apos;s here with island suit .
it &apos;s a double @-@ barreled suit .
that &apos;s how collins found us .
no . no . they &apos;re not working together . they can &apos;t be .
you &apos;re good , burke . i &apos;ll give you that .
but i haven &apos;t played my trump card .
senors and senras ! your attention , please !
what the hell are you doing ?
you may know this man as james maine .
his real name is neal caffrey .
con man , art thief , forger , fugitive .
vamonos . we have to go now .
it won &apos;t work , moz . they &apos;re not gonna give me up .
i &apos;m offering $ 500,000 for the capture of this man .
you bring him to me , and the money &apos;s yours .
unless they &apos;re paid to .
all right ?
now , take a good look at his face .
i don &apos;t care what condition you bring him to me .
just bring him to me .
collins , what &apos;s that about ?
we all have our methods .
were you ordered to bring him back alive
or just bring him back ?
i &apos;m sorry , did i not specify &quot; alive &quot; ?
go ahead . arrest me , agent .
that &apos;s right . you can &apos;t .
you have no jurisdiction here .
neither do you .
that &apos;s why i need the help of these good people .
that &apos;s my wallet , kid !
hey , if you need cash ,
i know how you could make half a million !
no , no .
you know , i used to take pride
in being able to steal your wallet .
but if a kid can do it ...
how are you , peter ?
all right .
damn good to see you .
you too .
look , neal , i --
awfully convenient , suit .
neal calls you , and the next day
you &apos;re sharing pina coladas with the super @-@ suit on our island ?
it was the only way i could warn you .
collins is dangerous .
we noticed .
he &apos;s turned half the island against us .
which is why we need to get out of here as soon as possible .
all right . the airport &apos;s burned .
they &apos;ll be looking for us there .
then by sea it is .
my associate lorenzo has a charter boat .
can his silence be bought ?
please . i officiated his daughter &apos;s wedding .
he can drop us over here .

transport &apos;s still on route . what &apos;s your rush ?
thank you again for all your help .
it &apos;s what you pay me for , isn &apos;t it ?
keep the local government out of your hair .
but wait -- this wasn &apos;t
the local government , was it ?
it was the united states government on my island .
i didn &apos;t mean to cause you any trouble .
and yet you did , neal . you did .
thankfully , i &apos;ve made a few calls and cleaned up your mess .
i never told you my name was neal .
but i did .
