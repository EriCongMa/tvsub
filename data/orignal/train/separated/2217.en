Prosecutor's last and final offer was 18 months.
We accepted it.
When do you have to surrender?
Tomorrow morning.
I love you.
Forever?
Forever.
How you holding up?
Um, hanging in there.
What about Adam?
He's keeping his head down, doing his time.
Why would Gabriel cut a deal with Shioma
just to turn around and kill him?
Because it was all a power play.
He was just biding his time, earning the Yakuza's trust
until he could make his move.
He's got no one left to align himself with.
What do you think his next move is?
What do you want?
You guys mind if I get a selfie for my boy?
Knock yourself out.
My son's not gonna believe
the Bennett brothers are in my cab.
Martellus, you was his starting tight end in his fantasy team.
Man, I don't know your son,
but he sounds like the smartest kid on the planet.
Hey, what about me?
The Seahawks' vicious defense?
Actually, no.
You got to swing this cab to one of these local stores
so I can polish up, you know, the Super Bowl Ring.
Why you always got to go there?
"My ring, my ring, my ring"
That's all it's been for the last two years with you.
Hey, look, bro, we're the champ.
You always bring the backup.
You know, I got to say, love watching you guys in the Pro Bowl.
Only bad thing about playing in the Pro Bowl here
is having to go home.
Yeah, this island has that effect on people.
Yeah, I'm not gonna miss the traffic.
This is ridiculous.
You know what? We could get out and walk from here.
Come on, bro, let's go.
Hey, here's a tip for your son
on how to win his fantasy football league.
迈克尔·本内特
Here's a little something for yourself.
Mahalo.
What the hell's going on?
What is that?
Oh, my God.
Hey, what's up?
I thought you went to go visit Adam this morning.
I did.
Okay.
Everything all right?
Did you know Gabriel Waincroft went to
visit Adam three months ago?
Who told you that?
Warden Grier.
He was investigating a cyber breach
and found there was a visitor that had been deleted from their logs.
And when they looked at the video, they saw it was Gabriel.
He used an alias to get inside.
Why wouldn't Adam tell you if Gabriel came to visit him?
I asked him the same thing.
He said he didn't want me to worry.
That if Gabriel could have a sit-down with him in prison,
he could easily have him killed.
Well, what did Gabriel want?
He told Adam that he had taken care of Shioma.
That it was only a matter of time
before all the other families would be out of his way.
But what he really needed to grow his business
was someone who understood how things operated.
He was offering him a job.
Adam turned it down, though.
Do you believe him?
Of course.
Kono, if you believe him,
then why are we here?
Hey! H-hold the elevator!
Pregnant lady! Pregnant lady! Hold the elevator!
Congratulations. When are you due?
Yeah I know. Uncool.
Uh, but I've already been late to work three times this week.
Oh, impressive, considering it's only Tuesday.
Look at that.
Must be fate.
You know, some people might call it coincidence, but not me.
I'm a big believer in the laws of probability.
You know, game theory.
Steve Nash.
I think you mean John Nash.
And game theory is more about mathematical strategy
than probability.
You sure?
Yup.
Totally just crashed and burned there, didn't I?
Passing yourself off as a pregnant woman
wasn't the strongest opening move.
Strategically speaking.
Ah, I see what you did there.
If it's any consolation,
we'll probably never see each other again.
What a relief.
After you.
Steve Nash is a basketball player, you idiot.
Are you following me?
What? No way.
I work here, so it's sort of like you're following me,
if you think about it.
So much for never seeing each other again.
Um, excuse me. I'm sorry.
Wh-What are you doing here exactly?
Chunk!
Jer-bear.
So good to finally see you!
Oh, guys.
I want you to meet my baby sister Isabel.
Isabel, these are my colleagues:
Steve McGarrett, Danny Williams
and Lou Grover.
Uh, it's so good to finally meet you.
Jerry's told me all about you.
Yeah, you, too.
He's talked a lot about you, too... Chunk.
‭Chunk, huh?
Uh, I was kind of a chunky baby.
Kind of?
12 pounds is still a record in the Ortega family.
12 pounds?
Should've seen the size of her diapers.
Okay, Jer, I think they get the point.
Uh, Jerry tells us you're at UCLA Law.
That's-that's impressive.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
One more year, and she'll be Counselor Ortega.
How long you, uh, you gonna be in town?
Oh, just a few days.
I had some time over spring break
and thought I'd come home and see my big bro.
I'm sorry, can we hold on a second,
back it up a few beats?
I need a little clarity on something.
Um, you two are related?
Like, biologically?
Oh, yeah, that's Eric.
We've met.
Yeah, this is my nephew.
Maybe not biologically;
we're gonna do some tests and find out.
Cold, Uncle D.
Uncle Danny. Okay? Okay? Okay?
Look, I just said what we're all thinking, right?
You got somewhere to be or something?
Uh, isn't there some very important security...
There you go.
Thanks.
Oh. You're not gonna believe it.
Someone released an elephant from the circus last night,
and HPD still hasn't found it.
I heard about that on the news.
Anyone hurt?
Thankfully, no.
Normally, we don't work the Ace Ventura beat,
but HPD asked us to help out,
since the elephant's a danger to the public.
I'm gonna make a bold prediction:
somebody grabbed this elephant, okay?
Nothing that big ever disappears into thin air.
Maybe we should call TSA.
You know, see if David Copperfield is on island.
You know, 'cause he's an illusionist.
No, we get it.
Damn, I'm having a rough morning.
Hey, Eric, why don't you, uh, why don't you
go to your office and scrub that footage,
see if you can help us I.D. a suspect?
Absolutely.
I'm on it.
All right, well, we're off to the Batcave.
Gonna show Isabel where the real magic happens.
Nice to meet you.
And off they go down to the basement.
You got to admire his enthusiasm.
Oh, come on, McGarrett.
You know you need to go on and give homeboy his badge.
You nuts? This guy believes in aliens.
You want to give him authority over sane people?
I didn't say give him a gun.
McGarrett.
Yup, we're on the way. Danny.
Wait up, guys!
Jerry, what are you doing here?
Thought you were giving Isabel a tour of the Batcave.
Well, I was, until I heard
we had a murder victim at Universal Exports.
Wasn't gonna miss this.
Why?
Come on. You've heard of Area 51?
The Bermuda Triangle?
The mob cemetery under Giants Stadium?
What do these all have in common?
The whack jobs that believe in them.
Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're gonna make a list of
totally awesome places to visit before you die,
Universal Exports would be at the top of that list.
Why is that?
You're kidding, right?
I'm not.
Jerry, just tell us,
tell us what you're talking about.
Why is this place so awesome?
No spoilers. You'll thank me later.
Hey, guys, we're in here.
It looks pretty amazing so far.
Who is he?
David Makana. He's the overnight security guard.
His body was discovered this morning when
the daytime guard came in for his shift.
C.O.D. is a close-range GSW to the back of the head-- no witnesses.
All right, this guy's gun is still in his holster.
Whoever did this must have got the jump on him.
Or maybe he knew his attacker. What else do we know?
Well, Makana's retinal scan was used to
access the facility at 11:32 P.M.
We're thinking our perp used him to get inside,
then executed him.
We got any idea what these guys were after?
No, CEO is on his way down to talk to us now.
So far, everyone we've talked to hasn't really given us much.
Makes sense.
They don't want us to know what they're working on here.
You've been here before, Jer?
No, he wishes he had though.
Come on, guys, this is simple math.
Who employs round-the-clock armed security
and biometric entry for an export business?
This place is a front for a top-secret defense contractor.
We're talking next-gen tech,
highly-classified Q Branch stuff.
You know, he's got a point.
Mahalo, Chin.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Clark Brighton, the CEO here.
I was hoping to provide you with security footage from last night,
but our system was hacked.
The cameras were deactivated.
Whoever hit us knew what they were doing.
Okay, Chin, why don't you get that data over to CSU.
Have them scrub it, see if they can find the source of the breach.
That won't be necessary.
My cyber team already attempted to track down the source.
Unfortunately, it originated on the Tor network.
It's impossible to trace.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brighton, what did you say you do here again?
Look, I want to be helpful, but...
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.
What I can tell you
is that something very valuable was stolen from us last night.
Look, we know you're not an export company,
so why don't you just save us the double-talk
and tell us what was taken.
I'm afraid I can't tell you that unless you sign this.
Confidentiality agreement.
Nice signature.
Without a signature, they can't forge it.
I'm sorry, but can I see your badge?
Uh, Mr. Ortega is actually a special consultant with our task force.
Unfortunately, I can't allow him through without credentials.
You see?
This is why I need a badge.
Jerry, it's not the time.
It's certainly not the venue, okay?
Well, at least tell me one thing.
What does this really do?
It writes.
Follow me please.
Oh, you're good.
Over the past two years,
we've been designing a prototype tactical suit
for the U.S. Military.
This is a scale representation of what was stolen.
When is this thing gonna be combat ready?
The suit's fully functional, Commander.
Our plan is to have it in theater within the next three years.
What does something like this cost?
We've spent $80 million developing it.
And not to sound too hyperbolic,
but it is the Holy Grail of next-gen weapon defense.
Okay, well, then why only one guard to protect it?
An export company with too large a security presence
would draw unwanted attention.
Anonymity is our best defense.
What are the suit's capabilities?
The suit's made of a liquid armor,
which hardens when hit.
This protects the soldier from lethal impact.
It also monitors vitals, provides sensor cues,
and enhances the soldier's overall metabolics.
Something that sophisticated has also got to have a tracking device.
It does, but it was disabled.
Okay, well, only someone with knowledge of that suit
would know how to do that.
That's correct.
How many people know about this thing?
Between investors, developers and technicians,
maybe 20.
All right. We'll need a list of those names.
Whatever I can do to help.
This suit's worth $80 million.
Whoever stole it is looking to get paid.
Or they're looking to use it.
I think we should assume they're gonna use it.
How do we stop it?
You can't.
You saw the test.
The suit's made with zero vulnerabilities.
It's indestructible.
Great.
So we're chasing Iron Man.
So, I go through this list of names that Brighton gave me,
and this guy goes right to the top of the list. Here.
That is Hugh Foster.
Foster was on the R&D team for the suit.
Eight months ago, they catch this genius shopping around
specs of the suit to rival companies.
He avoids jail time by taking a plea deal,
but according to his financials,
he got wiped out with legal fees
and he hasn't had a job ever since.
Okay, so we got an ex-employee who's pissed off.
Not only does he have insider knowledge of the suit,
but he's also financially motivated.
I will bring him in.
Here it is.
Pretty rad, right?
Very rad, Jer.
I'm really happy for you.
Well, I figured it was about time I got out of Mom's basement.
That and she moved to Maui.
Yeah, that did kind of force my hand.
Makaha Beach.
Yeah, you remember that place?
Of course.
Dad used to take us there on the weekends.
Remember he bought you
that metal detector for your birthday,
and you thought you found an alien time capsule.
Okay, to be fair, I was only eight years old,
and I'd never seen a beer keg before.
Dad loved that spot.
Yeah, a couple times, he wrote me a doctor's note
and we went there on a school day.
I didn't know that.
Neither did Mom.
I miss him a lot.
Yeah, me, too.
He'd be so proud of you.
Oh, look, Jerry, there's something really important
I need to talk to you about.
Sure, what is it?
Hold on one second.
Okay.
Special Consultant Jerry Ortega. How can I help you?
Hi, Eric.
Okay, I'll be right there.
Sorry, sis, duty calls.
Don't worry about it. We can talk about it later.
You sure?
Absolutely.
I'll be right back.
Okay.
Again.
I told you, I had nothing to do with the suit going missing.
How stupid do you think I am?
You are definitely stupid enough to get caught,
uh, trying to sell plans to a rival company.
Which is exactly why I would never steal it.
Since I'd be the obvious suspect.
I mean, it took you all of, what,
an hour to get to me?
Where were you last night at around 11:30 p.m.?
Movies.
I caught a late showing at the Cinezone in Mililani.
You got anybody to back that up?
No, I went alone.
I don't have many friends these days
since Brighton ruined my life.
Okay, so what you're saying is that you have no real alibi,
but plenty of motive.
Look, I made a mistake.
I almost went to jail for it.
You really think I'd risk everything a second time?
For $80 million, yes, I do.
If I was sitting on that kind of payout,
you think you would've found me
on my couch watching The Price is Right?
If it wasn't you,
it was somebody you tried to sell those specs to.
All right? So what you're gonna do
is you're gonna give us a list of the names
of all the people you tried to sell them to,
anybody you mentioned it to;
I don't care if it was a date you were trying to impress.
I've been going through the footage.
Turns out, the elephant escape
was actually a botched kidnapping.
Somebody was trying to rescue the animal from the circus.
I did get a pretty good screen-grab
of one of the people involved.
That's great.
But why are we whispering?
Because.
Look at this.
It's the only image we have of the perpetrator.
They're very aware of the cameras, very prepared.
Until the part where the elephant got away.
Great, but I thought you said you got a clear picture of him.
I did.
Right around the time Dumbo was rampaging down Kalakaua,
I found this.
Same exact cargo truck pulls up on Kuhio.
And look who's driving the truck.
Your sister.
Who else knows about this?
Nobody.
Yet.
But, Jerry, I have a responsibility to Five-0.
You know this. I got to tell them.
Eric, I'm just begging you to hold off.
I know my sister; this isn't like her.
Just give me a chance to talk to her
and find out what's going on.
Maybe I can buy you some time.
How?
My computer crashed.
Thanks.
Well, Foster's alibi checks out.
He was at the movies at the time of the break-in.
All right, so this exonerates Foster.
What about the companies he gave us?
Still in the process of clearing them,
but I got to tell you the truth,
I don't think any of them are involved either.
Why?
I talked to the Department of Justice, okay?
They handled Foster's plea deal.
When Foster started naming names,
the DOJ started making pen registers and wiretaps
on any and everybody that was attempting to buy that suit.
If it had been one of these other companies,
Justice would have known.
So, what? We've just exhausted our entire list of suspects?
I'm afraid so, partner.
No.
No, w-we got to be missing something.
That suit didn't just get up
and walk out of Universal Exports on its own.
He's still inside.
Make any demands yet?
Radio silence.
You got anybody in lockup?
Not since last night.
Then what the hell does he want?
Duke, who's he got with him?
That's David Atowa.
He's our property clerk, works in the evidence room.
Tell your men to stand down.
There's no way they're gonna stop this guy.
Stand down.
I repeat,
hold fire.
My name is Commander Steve McGarrett.
I'm with Five-0.
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Do not engage! Do not engage!
We're just gonna let him go?
We got to let him go.
You try to stop that guy, you're gonna lose that officer.
All teams, stand down.
Target is free to go.
Standing down.
Roger that.
Yes, this is Commander Steve McGarrett.
I need an immediate satellite realignment
and grid coverage on my position.
Target is a black SUV leaving my location now. Grover?
Yeah.
Copy that. Thank you.
Get Chin and Kono down here, process the scene.
I want to know exactly why this guy came here,
exactly what he wants.
All right.
Duke, we're gonna get Officer Atowa back, okay?
Look, I tried to tell you,
but you kept getting called away.
Well, obviously you didn't try hard enough!
And what the hell were you thinking?
I was thinking about saving that poor elephant's life.
Oh, so you decided to kidnap her?
Look, a few years ago, I got involved with an activist group,
Animals Without Chains.
We help relocate animals that are being abused.
So this is what the whole trip was about.
Had nothing to do with seeing me.
Jerry, of course I wanted to see you,
but Mazie needed my help.
Mazie?
Yes.
The plan was to relocate her to a sanctuary in Thailand.
She's supposed to be halfway around the world right now,
and everything was going fine until...
Till you forgot you were dealing with a 6,000-pound wild animal!
A car alarm went off as I was leading her into the truck.
It spooked her.
This has never happened to me before.
Before?
How many times have you done something like this?
Enough to know that it's worth the risk.
These animals are emotional, sensitive creatures.
You know, they don't deserve to be kept in captivity
and exploited for profit.
Okay.
On principle, I agree with you.
But you broke the law, Isabel,
and now that elephant is loose somewhere on the island.
Actually, no.
It isn't.
Jerry, I'd like you to meet Mazie.
Mazie, this is my brother Jerry.
Hello.
How'd you get her here?
It wasn't easy.
Okay, look, I was able to buy you a few hours
before Five-0 finds out you're behind all this,
but they're gonna find out.
Which is why you need to return Mazie to the circus,
and then we can figure out some legal way to get her out.
It's not that easy, Jer.
It's almost impossible to get these animals
out of the hands of the circus.
And when it does happen, it takes years of litigation.
Meanwhile, she's living in terrible conditions
and being abused by her handlers.
Yeah, but what about law school?
Everything you've been working for?
You could go to jail for this, Izzy.
I know that, but look at what these people did to her.
And that's just the visible abuse.
Imagine all of the emotional scars she has.
Look, remember when we were kids
and Mom and Dad got us tickets to go to the circus,
but we never went?
Of course. We were crushed.
There was no tsunami warning that day.
The real reason we didn't go was because,
after years of abuse, Tyke the elephant
broke out of her cage the day before the show.
HPD had no choice.
They shot and killed her.
They were trying to protect us from the truth.
Later on, I found out what happened,
and it always stuck with me.
That's why I'm here.
And that's why I need your help.
What can I do?
Mazie was supposed to be on a ship last night.
I was able to convince the captain
to give me until midnight tonight.
But if she's not on the boat by then,
they're gonna leave without her.
Problem is
I had to ditch the transport truck
because I knew that HPD would be out looking for it.
So you need a new truck.
I know I'm asking for a lot.
But I can't let her go back to that life, Jerry.
I just can't.
It's a miracle no one got hit.
It's not a miracle.
If he was here to kill police, he would've.
This is where he entered, took the hostage.
He was looking for something.
And he made sure we wouldn't be able to see what it was.
Yeah, well, whatever it was,
he was willing to take on a whole army of cops to get it.
Let me just get this straight so I'm clear.
You tell SWAT to stand down,
but you think that us, with a couple of pistols
and a righteous disposition,
we're gonna take this guy down?
Yeah, that's right.
That's right?
What are you, what are you, nuts?
This-this man that we are chasing
is wearing an indestructible suit
that not even your big, dumb head could penetrate.
Right.
You got a plan? You want to tell me what your plan is?
Sure. Soon as I figure it out,
you'll be the first to know. How about that?
Faster. Stay close to the shoulder.
Somebody jumped out of the car.
Where is he?
He went that way.
He could be anywhere.
I'll call HPD.
How's Officer Atowa?
He's okay. He's lucky to be alive.
You have any idea what our suspect was after?
No, he was taken after the evidence room break-in,
so he has no idea.
What about you?
I ran the plate on the SUV that the suspect was driving.
It was reported stolen this morning.
So I just got off the phone with Duke.
After a thorough inventory check,
HPD discovered what our suspect was after:
a Beretta M9.
It's a key piece of evidence
in the murder case against Luke Waiola;
he's on trial right now.
HPD's been trying to put that guy away for a long time.
Right, and that Beretta is the first piece of hard evidence
ever linking him to a crime.
Chin, when was that Beretta
supposed to be presented in court?
Tomorrow.
Without that gun, Waiola walks.
Well, I can assure you my client had nothing to do
with the theft of the prototype suit or that Beretta.
Okay, uh, that's-that's fine.
We think, uh, maybe he wasn't behind it,
but he had something to do with it
and knows who it was.
As a matter of fact, we're pretty sure your client
was the first person contacted after that gun was stolen.
You have any evidence to support these claims?
Yeah, we do. We do.
We have a wire in the amount of $10 million.
The money was transferred an hour after the gun was stolen
from one of Waiola's offshore accounts
to one of his shell corporations that you, of all people,
have access to.
So, uh, I'm thinking either he was trying to get you
to give out early Christmas bonuses,
or, um, he was actually interested in purchasing that Beretta.
Right. Whoever did this gave your client
the opportunity to buy a mistrial, okay?
There's no gun. There's no case.
So why don't you tell us everything you know,
and save yourself the trouble of going to prison.
You do that. You have my word. We will protect you.
I was contacted this morning.
Caller said, for $10 million,
he could make that gun disappear.
Otherwise, he was gonna put it right back where he found it.
All right, when's the exchange?
In one hour.
You sure he's your brother?
Since the day I was born.
What are you saying?
DNA. It's a great mystery.
No offense, brother.
None taken, if you do me this favor.
I'm listening.
You still got that truck you used to haul around
the shave ice carts in?
Maybe.
Well, a buddy of mine needs to tow
his catamaran down to the docks,
and I was hoping I could borrow it.
Have it back to you by morning.
You're lying, Jerry.
What? I'm not.
Just like when you were on my payroll.
You asked me for the day off to take your appendix out.
I knew you were lying then,
just like I know you're lying now.
Okay, fine, the truck's for me
and it's not exactly a catamaran.
It's smaller, but only by a little.
It's for a friend.
He's flying tonight and he's a very anxious traveler.
Uh, you understand, this is a highly unusual request.
I know, and normally I wouldn't ask you for this kind of favor,
except his doctor's out of town,
and he desperately needs a sedative
or else he won't be able to fly home and visit his sick mother.
And I think you understand
that I tend to not give out prescriptions
due to the fact 100% of my patients are dead.
Well, then here's a chance to help someone who's alive.
Well, I hate to deprive a son from visiting his ill mother.
Okay.
In order to administer the correct dosage,
I'll need to know how much your friend weighs.
about... 6,000 pounds.
We got movement.
Either he likes wearing that suit,
or he knew something was gonna happen.
Boss, I got a clean shot of the gas tank for
a concussion play,
but that makes the lawyer collateral.
Other than that, I have zero vulnerabilities.
Stand down.
Steve, we already lost him once.
Now that he has what he wants, he's gonna disappear for good.
Yeah, but what choice do we have
as long as he's wearing that suit?
We got to let him go.
Not this time.
That suit may have made you invincible.
Didn't make you very smart.
Son of a bitch.
It's Foster. I thought you said he had an airtight alibi.
All right, let's go, Iron Man.
Mazie should have a peaceful journey.
I really appreciate this, Max.
And everyone else's help.
Yeah, anytime.
It's time.
Feels pretty good to help an animal in need, doesn't it?
Better sanitize that truck fully
before you turn it back to me, brother.
Mahalo nui loa.
I'm proud of you.
Evidence. To be returned.
Here's the thing, I was thinking that we keep it.
We say that it disappeared.
Wouldn't be the first time, right?
What do you think?
What are you gonna do with an $80 million piece of hardware?
I'm gonna wear it.
You're gonna wear it?
Yeah.
Okay.
Right? 'Cause this thing is, you know...
it's completely McGarrett proof.
It's been designed for your partner to wear.
Oh, we're doing that.
Still with that?
Six years.
Since the day I met you, you've been telling me
I've been trying to kill you.
What's your point?
What's my point? My point is this is getting old.
You're very much alive.
You're very much alive, which means I have your back.
I've always had your back.
So what are you talking about?
Now return this to Universal Exports before you break it.
It's indestructible, you idiot.
Oh, perfect timing. I was just about to come to see you.
Oh, I'm glad I could save you the trip. What's up?
Do you know who else
used the "I was at a movie alibi"?
LHO.
Lee Harvey Oswald.
He ducked into the Texas Theatre
right after he and associates killed JFK.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure the Warren Commission
would disagree with some of this, but okay.
Okay, well, just like the "Multiple Shooter" theory,
I can also explain how Hugh Foster
was in two places at the same time.
Check this out.
Wait for it.
What am I looking at? I-I don't get it.
The movie showtimes.
They're from last week.
Foster hacked into the movie theater surveillance system
and replaced the footage of him going to the movies
with the night of the murder.
Nice work, Jerry.
Badge-worthy?
No. Patience.
Oh, what'd you come down to see me for?
Oh, I was just gonna tell you about this thing that happened.
It's-it's crazy.
HPD found a trough and a bunch of hay,
uh, in Paradise Park.
Apparently, it was a temporary pen for that missing elephant.
Interesting.
You don't know anything about that, do you?
Me? No, why? What? Of course not.
Yeah, I-I didn't think you did.
Oh, I got you something, too.
This is for you and Isabel.
Circus tickets.
‭- Yeah.
Awesome.
There's no elephant in the show this year,
but I hear the rest of it's pretty good.
Am I going to jail?
'Cause I was kind of hoping that the whole immunity
and means deal would apply to me, too.
Good night, Jerry.
Is that a yes or a no?
Solomon Tuasopo?
Officer Kono Kalakaua. Five-0.
I know who you are.
Then you know my husband is Adam Noshimuri.
Yeah.
Something I can help you with?
I know you were the guard on duty
when Gabriel Waincroft came to visit Adam.
You gave an official statement that you didn't know who he was.
But I find that pretty hard to believe,
considering that Gabriel was an inmate at Halawa
and you're a guard there.
There are over 1,000 inmates there.
You think I remember every one of them?
Gabriel paid you to let him in, didn't he?
I think we're done here.
Gabriel offered Adam a job.
I want to know what his answer was.
If you want to know, you should go ask your husband.
