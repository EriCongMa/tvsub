第二十六季第十七集
一年一度骑自行车的日子
i haven &apos;t ridden a bike
since lance armstrong was a good guy .
geez , lis , you &apos;re riding the girliest bike in the world .
ooh , i stand corrected .
hey , dipwad , bikes only .
i need to pay my water bill .
not on motorized transport , you don &apos;t .
what you need to get is out of our way .
yeah , bikes win again !
trains win again !
when will you people give up your dependence on handlebars ?
quite a schwinn @-@ dig , eh ?
shut up , biking flanders .
chief , no , don &apos;t go in the doughnut shop !
your pants are too tight !
oh , i &apos;m just gonna eat one little ...
drinkers , if you go on the wagon ,
make sure it &apos;s the duff beer wagon .
duffman , how about a 21 @-@ thrust salute
to america &apos;s military ?
my hips are proud to honor our endless war .
one , two , three ...
ow , god !
something &apos;s wrong with barry .
never use ... my mortal name in public .
i have very troubling news .
duffman is undergoing hip replacement surgery .
now , barry will be fine , but as of this moment
there is no duffman .
they came for joe camel ,
and i said nothing .
they came for the frito bandito ,
and still i said nothing .
so what are you saying now ?
about what ?
duffman , the man , has retired .
but duffman , the idea , endures .
authorities are unsure whether the empty bottles
are a beautiful tribute
or just drunks too lazy to find a trash can .
either way , the duff corporation announces
an open televised competition
to find out who will be the next duffman .
in other news , the chinese land on mars .
also , no more elephants .
now , for more cool , refreshing news ...
marge , what would you think if i tried out to be duffman ?
i know why you want to be duffman .
it &apos;s so you can drink free beer and get shnockered all day .
sure , i admit i get &quot; shnockered &quot; once in a while .
i might have been &quot; lacquered &quot; from time to time .
i may have , how you say , had a subconjunctival hemorrhage .
but this isn &apos;t about that .
then what is this about ?
marge , if i died today , the obituary would read ,
&quot; h. simpson , father of three , extra pallbearers needed . &quot;
being duffman would give me another line .
okay , sweetie , you can try .
great , but it won &apos;t be easy .
i got to start practicing now .
ladies and gentlemen ,
your hostess , the inescapable cat deeley .
are you ready to find out
who will be america &apos;s next duffman ?
yes , cat , yes !
a million times , yes !
america &apos;s next duffman will be selected
by the planet &apos;s foremost experts in the field of party starting--
best @-@ selling electronica artist ,
der zip zorp .
former duff girl and current senator from oklahoma ,
the honorable missy lebeau .
i look reasonable , but i &apos;m not .
and billionaire mumbai entrepreneur ,
rajneesh superstar .
bottle service , ballers !
now let &apos;s welcome the chairman of duff industries ,
mr. h.k. duff vii .
thank you , cat .
i just want to say ,
if we can &apos;t find ourselves a duffman out of this group ,
then maybe we &apos;ll just give up on the concept .
brilliant !
now , let &apos;s find our duffman .
i &apos;m ... coming up ... oh , yeah !
my two favorite words aside from &quot; seacrest passed , &quot;
can i get an &quot; oh , yeah &quot; ?
like mexico misses california .
it &apos;s down to two .
and before revealing our results ,
former duffman , barry huffman , is here to wish you luck .
i was told there would be morphine .
homer , any last thoughts on what duff means to you ?
without duff , i wouldn &apos;t have have brought
three beautiful children into the world .
that &apos;s right , man .
we &apos;re beer babies .
the judges are conferring .
we have our decision .
karma is in the house , dawg !
homer , your words were beautiful .
that is exactly why
you &apos;re america &apos;s next top duffman ...
runner @-@ up !
the real winner is america &apos;s new hero--
contestant number 12 !
what is it , der zip zorp ?
olde ogdenville ale ?
he drinks a competitor .
reverse the confetti .
and check the fat guy for tattoos .
just one that says &quot; marge madness . &quot;
these reality shows really leave you no privacy .
well , i guess that makes this guy duffman .
ooh , ooh , ooh , do i get the confetti ? !
one confettus .
i mean ...
i mean , oh , yeah !
that &apos;s how we &apos;ll tell the trades you got the job .
seems awfully overproduced .
just take the oath .
night gathers , and now my duff watch begins .
it shall not end until my death .
or my 13 @-@ week option is not picked up .
i shall take no wife , hold no lands , and father no children ,
except for the wife and house and kids i &apos;m already stuck with .
i shall wear no other beer &apos;s crowns .
i am the six @-@ pack hidden in daddy &apos;s secret cabinet .
i put the &quot; fest &quot; in oktoberfest
and sell for eight bucks at ballparks ,
though i have nothing to offer but my suds ,
head and beers ,
and promotional cozies ,
for this night and all the nights to come .
when life looks hopeless , it &apos;s not .
* duff beer , feeling no pain *
* made from canadian rain *
* tastes like nickel champagne *
* it will tickle your brain *
* duff beer , feeling no pain *
* made from canadian rain *
and here &apos;s a painting of my ancestor ichabod duff ,
crossing the duffaware river .
ah , hell , this is all bs .
duffman was a fascist icon my grandfather repurposed
&apos;cause he couldn &apos;t get the damn rights to woody woodpecker .
mr. duff , can i ask what &apos;s in this safe ?
little lady , inside that safe is the formula for duff itself ,
known only to three people--
me , condoleezza rice , and my brother @-@ in @-@ law terry .
and the combination is not known to any human ...
uh , what the ... ?
&quot; schlitz plus water . &quot;
why don &apos;t you kids run off and play in the bottle cap pit ?
don &apos;t cut yourselves !
mr. duff , i want to say something .
i &apos;m proud of my husband ,
but i &apos;m not sure if this is something homie should be doing .
just what do you mean ?
well , aren &apos;t you making him a superhero
so that beer looks cool to kids ?
uh , marge ,
let me tell you a little something about beer .
do you know why man stopped running around ,
lassoing mastodons , and became civilized ?
no .
so he could grow hops and make beer .
it &apos;s true .
our beer has helped people celebrate weddings .
enjoy a good game .
ease the pain of a lost loved one .
that &apos;s the tradition your husband will inherit .
geez , now you make me want to drink it .
attagirl , have a designer bag .
now , homer , there is one thing we needed to do in private .
okay , what ... ?
hey , that &apos;s not my butt !
we &apos;ve injected a chip in you
that detects the slightest presence
of alcohol in your blood .
you see , duffman cannot drink .
what ? that &apos;s funny .
i thought you just said that duffman can &apos;t drink .
but that would be crazy .
they all fight it at first .
you wouldn &apos;t tell batman he couldn &apos;t eat bats .
when you &apos;re duffman , you &apos;re at work , homer .
you wouldn &apos;t go to the nuclear plant drunk , would you ?
well , uh ...
my husband won &apos;t have any problem not drinking .
the only reason he wanted to become duffman
was to be respected and beloved .
and what better way to do that than to be stone @-@ cold sober ?
when my husband put on that costume ,
he didn &apos;t just put on a sleeveless shirt
that says &quot; duff &quot; on it and a cape for some reason ,
he put on responsibility .
and boots that i don &apos;t think will hold up in the rain .
but the point is-- it &apos;s not about being drunk ,
it &apos;s about being someone .
you &apos;re right , marge .
i will do something no one has ever done-- be fun sober .
what a crisp and refreshing attitude .
hey , this stuff is pretty good .
mmm , foamy marge .
uh , that &apos;s the chip .
no drinking .
i was licking my wife .
can you believe they put a chip in my arm ,
and i can &apos;t drink beer ?
ah , gee , tough break .
maybe moe could dig it out with a corkscrew .
oh , i would love that , homer , i really would .
but then duff might take away my neon sign ,
and , uh , it &apos;s the only thing lighting the bar .
whoa , creepy .
stop shooting those at each other .
relax , honey ,
no one &apos;s ever been killed by a t @-@ shirt cannon .
oh , no , it &apos;s the 5 : 00 blahs .
blah , blah , blah , blah .
help us , duffman !
drink duff !
care to team up with fruit batman ?
i &apos;m thinking of dumping kid sourpuss here .
i &apos;m a hero .
oh , i can see my obituary now .
watkins putting for the championship .
it &apos;s breaking towards the hole .
time to move from the links to the drinks !
well , if you guys like commercials ,
you &apos;re gonna love this .
wait , we never said we liked commercials .
* drink , drink . let the toast start *
* may young hearts never part *
* drink , drink , drink *
* let every true lover salute his sweetheart *
7罐享不够
* drink , drink , drink to *
h.k. , this new duffman is driving sales straight up .
turns out , men like men who look worse than them
selling them beer .
why did it take us 142 years to discover this ?
because executives are incompetent , sir ?
well , then why do i have so many ?
studies show when a decision is made by a group ,
everyone feels more confident ,
even though the decision could be incredibly stupid .
is this true ?
can &apos;t argue with that .
what do you guys think ?
did i hear a no from section c @-@ 72 ?
oh , uh , no , that was a , uh , &quot; whoa ! &quot;
give the whole lower bowl a raise .
uh , welcome aboard , duffman .
fair warning now-- at the end ,
i just might ask for an autograph for my son .
here you go-- they &apos;re all pre @-@ signed .
with nicknames .
buddy , sport , tiger , red .
uh , give me a &quot; red . &quot;
i &apos;ll start calling him that now ,
and then give it to him on his birthday .
now , where to , sir ?
oh , this is a romantic night .
how about everywhere ?
all right .
navigator , set a course for everywhere .
where the hell is that ?
i said everywhere !
now , homer , look through the beeriscope ,
and gaze upon the wonderful world
that you and duff have created .
captain , it never dawned on me
beer could have such a dark side .
you must be talking about new duff stout .
take us down .
i have to think .
to be honest , you said you wanted to go everywhere .
so we ran out of fuel an hour ago ,
but i didn &apos;t want to disappoint you ,
so i will toss down a tow rope .
hey , come here . man ...
uh ... this is not good .
marge , do you ever worry
that you made a giant mistake in your life ?
i need a little context .
not drinking beer has given me the clearness of mind
to realize drinking beer is bad .
i &apos;ve got to undo what i &apos;ve done .
hey , how you doing ?
观众的眼睛都要追不上飞驰的赛车
is this the most outrageous party you &apos;ve ever been to ?
well , guess what .
you &apos;ve all been served nothing but nonalcoholic duff .
then why am i throwing up right now ?
as duffman , i had the power
to switch the beer trucks working this race .
so you see , you don &apos;t need beer to have a good time .
join duffman today in saying ,
&quot; i &apos;ve had enough of that life @-@ ruining duff ! &quot;
why the hell did you do this ?
because duffman is a hero .
and with great taste comes great responsibility .
well , &quot; hero , &quot; here come your fans .
so long , suckers !
what the ... ? !
so long , suckers !
what the ... ? !
it &apos;s a circle .
so the answer is-- go in reverse .
so long , suckers .
what the ... ? !
i &apos;m not sure how many more times
we can watch dad chased down by an angry crowd
before it affects us psychologically .
as a family therapist , i can assure you
that you have all the coping skills you need .
why is lisa talking to an empty seat ?
see you next tuesday , dr. schulman .
you &apos;re in maui .
hey , my beer .
get him back in uniform .
homer , now , listen to me .
you &apos;re in a stadium surrounded by people
who want to kill you .
they don &apos;t have the guts .
now , there &apos;s one way out of your hell .
prove you still love beer .
drink this with gusto .
b @-@ but the chip .
there never was a chip .
it was all the power of suggestion .
you tricked me !
and i trusted you after you snuck up
and injected me without my consent .
just drink the beer , pretty boy .
whatever you do , you &apos;ll be my hero .
now you &apos;re pushing it .
homie , it &apos;s time to go .
come on , come on .
give me the beer inside you !
this place seems even sadder than before .
uh , yeah , well , i kind of gloomed it up a little
while you were gone .
nothing to see here , sunshine .
h @-@ hey , y @-@ you used to be duffman .
can i get a picture with you ?
i finally made it .
i &apos;m a has @-@ been .
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right .
ah , let &apos;s make it official , eh ?
oh , yeah . oh , yeah . oh , yeah .
sir , may i interest you in a french hazelnut latte
and an iggy azalea cd ?
i &apos;m not here for three @-@ buck coffee .
i &apos;m here to ask you to be duffman again .
and to use the bathroom .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , sir .
fine , can you tell me where your travel mugs are ?
yeah , over there .
come on , barry , i know it &apos;s you .
sorry , h.k. , i traded in my beer goggles
for coffee @-@ grinding pince @-@ nez .
are you telling me you don &apos;t miss the big time ?
the girls on the side , the corporate jet ?
there &apos;s talk of an animated series .
duffman would like a job where he could phone it in .
you just called yourself duffman .
duffman never took off his tights !
let &apos;s go , girls !
but we &apos;re managers here .
they learned the register better than me ! oh , yeah !
i see it as kind of a @-@ a triumph of @-@ of doing your work
from that very pure place
of @-@ of just doing stuff that you , uh , personally enjoy .
