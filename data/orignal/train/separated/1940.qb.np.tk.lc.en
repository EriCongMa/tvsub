not one bad outcome -- since november ?
how is that possible ?

we &apos;re not moving .
yeah , safety feature .
it did this to me after the last earthquake .
the last earthquake ?
i did a lot of research about seattle before i moved out here .
earthquakes were never mentioned .
they don &apos;t happen too often .
only when you ride in elevators , apparently .
apparently .
remind me not to ride in an elevator with you again .

and get them to trace the call on line three right now .
it &apos;s a kid with her injured mom in the mountains somewhere .
go .
okay .
are you still there ?
i &apos;m here . i &apos;m right here .
what &apos;s your name ?
ruby .
ruby , i &apos;m owen .
are you a doctor ? can -- can you help ?
i can . i &apos;m right here , and i &apos;m going to help you .
we were making s &apos;mores .
she was getting hot chocolate from the cabinet .
watch your back .
yes ,
it &apos;s a line coming into grey @-@ sloan memorial .
she was standing on the chair ,
and then everything was shaking .
then she fell . now -- now she &apos;s on the floor .
i @-@ i can barely see anything .
she &apos;s on the floor . is she awake ?
two hours ! i waited two hours ! no .
and now i still can &apos;t leave
because somebody double @-@ parked behind me !
shh . quiet , please .
don &apos;t you have security here or a valet ?
listen , i @-@ i &apos;ll find someone --
you better waive my co @-@ pay !
he said , &quot; quiet &quot; !
ruby , i am gonna move to another phone
so i can hear you better .
don &apos;t hang up .
no , no , no . i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m just moving to another phone .
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll be right there , okay ?
okay ?
okay .
i always screw this up .
what ?
no , no , no . no .
nothing . don &apos;t worry . uh , i &apos;ll be right back .
just hang on .
where &apos;s that chest x @-@ ray ?
move , move .
ruby , you still there ?
i @-@ i &apos;m here .
what &apos;s going on ?
uh , is your mom breathing ?
uh , yes , yes .
i @-@ i @-@ it sounds like she &apos;s snoring .
and is -- what position is she in ?
is she on her side ? is she -- - she &apos;s on her back .
she &apos;s just laying there . - 11 @-@ year @-@ old kid --
her mom fell at a vacation cabin somewhere .
uh , kepner &apos;s trying to trace the call .
uh , ruby , i need you to hold the phone
to your mom &apos;s mouth , okay ?
i need to listen .
okay .
an obstructed airway .
we need a trauma room . this one &apos;s free , right ?
no .
no .
occupied , apparently .
she needs to call 911 from a land line .
it &apos;s the only way the e.m.s. can trace her directly .
ruby , listen to me .
uh , what kind of phone are you calling on ?
if it is the phone in the cabin ,
you need to hang up and call 911 .
no , that one &apos;s dead . i @-@ i &apos;m on a cell -- my mom &apos;s .
cell won &apos;t work . crap . okay , okay .
her -- her lips are blue .
why are her lips turning blue ?
because your mom &apos;s not getting enough air .
so , no go on the open trauma room .
it &apos;s fine . these injuries look pretty superficial .
you know , we would be on the wolf run right now
if it was just you and me on the trip ,
like it was supposed to be .
dani , honey , this is not micah &apos;s fault .
it &apos;s not his fault he can &apos;t sit in a chair ?
because i think it is .
the kids ... don &apos;t get along .
oh , you &apos;re kidding .
karen and i got engaged over the summer
after three years of dating .
i would have proposed after the third date , but the kids ...
i thought , &quot; let &apos;s take a trip .
&quot; let &apos;s do something together as a family ,
see if it might help . &quot;
i think i made it worse .
do you think i make it worse ?
sometimes , adversity can make a family stronger .
or tear it apart .
i &apos;m just saying , swap me out .
i want to be close to the good stuff .
not that you &apos;re not the good stuff ,
but she &apos;s got a streak going .
stop saying that , and definitely don &apos;t say it to meredith ,
unless you want it to end .
you &apos;ll jinx her .
that hurts ?
i &apos;m concerned about this abdominal tenderness .
schedule a c.t. and rush his labs .
so -- so , you &apos;re not gonna swap me out ?
never mind .
could you go back one ?
one more ?
this one .
uh , how soon can we do it ?
well , uh ...
you know what ?
we &apos;re not gonna schedule the surgery quite yet .
but i want to do it before summer .
six weeks . then we &apos;ll all meet again .
we &apos;ll talk through our options .
thanks for coming in .
yeah , i don &apos;t get it .
are we no longer granting wishes today , or --
did you see how she looked to the boyfriend ?
he &apos;s not here for support . he &apos;s here for approval .
six weeks .
that &apos;s how long it &apos;s gonna take her to realize
that it &apos;s not her wish that we &apos;d be granting .
so , you &apos;re saying she was being too hasty .
i &apos;m saying i &apos;m not giving that girl a set of new breasts
that were never her idea in the first place .
that &apos;s just a bra full of regret .
all right , time to power up .
the posse &apos;s got a big afternoon .
ruby , open your mom &apos;s mouth
and -- and take two fingers
and sweep the back of your mom &apos;s throat ,
like a ... like a scooping motion .
she might have something blocking her airway .
let &apos;s see if you can get it .
o @-@ okay , okay .
there &apos;s nothing . what now ?
try a heimlich . give a hard push on your mom &apos;s --
belly ? i &apos;ve seen it on tv . how hard do i ... ?
as hard as you can .
nothing happened . nothing --
nothing came out . her -- her breathing &apos;s getting worse .
okay , um ... okay , okay , we &apos;re gonna --
we &apos;re gonna try opening her airway another way .
i @-@ i need you to put your hand under your mom &apos;s chin
and very gently lift it up .
no , wait , stop . you &apos;ll -- you &apos;ll paralyze her .
h @-@ hello ? what should i do ?
h @-@ hello ?
so , the good news is ,
your ekg and chest films came back clear .
oh , so my ticker &apos;s good . how about my kicker ?
well , you have what is called a below @-@ the @-@ stem femur fracture .
oopsy .
now , you have two cracks in the bone -- one here and here .
so , uh , how do we get me back in the saddle ?
so to speak .
well , i would like to completely replace the hardware .
now , it &apos;s a very big surgery , and it does carry risks ,
but you would come out of it with full flexibility ,
which i think is what --
so i &apos;d be good to go o @-@ on my back ?
you should be .
or on my side .
or -- or that thing , you know ,
where you bend over the couch and then he , uh --
like i said , full flexibility .
yeah , okay , but considering your cardiac history ,
i &apos;m not sure a big surgery is a great idea .
tell me dear , um , have you ever been married ?
are you seeing anyone or ... getting laid ?
well , that &apos;s not -- i mean --
you see , i was married to my husband for 44 years .
that &apos;s 44 years with the same man .
we had three children , seven grandchildren ,
and a lifetime of memories .
huh .
he was the first man that i ever loved .
and he &apos;s the only man that i ever will love .
but i &apos;ll be hot @-@ damned if he &apos;s going to be the only man
to ever razz my berries .
i mean , i have time left ,
and there &apos;s still things that i want to do , you know ?
there &apos;s things that -- that i haven &apos;t done ,
and there &apos;s a whole lot of things that ,
i @-@ i mean , i didn &apos;t even know you could do .
you know -- you know , like that thing where you go -- you know ?
we got it .
yeah .
i mean , what &apos;s the point of living
i @-@ if you can &apos;t try something new ?
i want that surgery .
sounds good .
that is a 5 @-@ hour surgery on a 75 @-@ year @-@ old
who has a stent and is on blood thinners .
i can &apos;t believe you would suggest a surgery like that
to a patient without running it by me first .
i &apos;m sorry . you called me for my opinion .
look , i do hip replacements all the time
on far older patients with far weaker hearts .
she is clearly still active .
uh , i think her heart &apos;s in pretty good shape .
that &apos;s not your call .
okay , we are talking about a healthy , vibrant woman here .
she deserves the best quality of life that we can give her .
if she wants a new hip , that &apos;s her call .
so she can get laid ? really ? really ?
you think that &apos;s important enough
to risk her dying on the table ?
if her hip is so damaged that she winds up immobilized
and bed @-@ ridden for the rest of her life ,
then , yeah , i sure do , because either way , she &apos;s dying .
fine . i will reevaluate the images and take a closer look .
maybe there &apos;s another option . okay ?
thank you .
kepner told me about the little girl .
what can i do ? what ? can i help ?
we are trying to get an airway .
by risking paralysis .
i &apos;d rather have her paralyzed and alive
than dead with respiratory arrest .
do you have a better idea ?
h @-@ hello ? are you still there ?
ruby . go ahead .
lift her chin and pull it forward -- gently .
o @-@ okay .
okay , now put the phone on your mom &apos;s chest okay ?
and let me listen .
the stridor &apos;s gone .
she opened the airway , but --
she still could be in distress .
it &apos;s something else .
ruby , put your head on your mom &apos;s chest
on the left side and listen .
i don &apos;t hear anything .
what am i listening for ?
breathing . do you hear her breathing ?
no .
owen .
owen .
okay , okay , um , okay , ruby , now put your ear
on the right side and listen .
anything ?
ruby ?
she -- she &apos;s breathing ! i @-@ i hear it !
okay , could be a tension pneumo .
mm @-@ hmm . ruby , um , now just push the phone into your mom &apos;s chest ,
r @-@ right where you were just listening .
just push the phone in and move it .
that &apos;s sub @-@ q air . do you hear that ?
mm @-@ hmm . she &apos;s gonna need --
she &apos;s gonna need to release the trapped air
with a chest tube or something .
okay .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s the only way , or her mom &apos;s gonna suffocate .
oh , you mean --
you &apos;re gonna ask her to --
okay . ruby , i &apos;m gonna ask you to try something .
it &apos;s gonna be fine ,
and i &apos;m gonna walk you through it , step by step , okay ?
o @-@ okay , but can you tell me fast ?
the phone keeps beeping .
i @-@ i think it &apos;s running out of battery .
what are you doing here ?
i am hiding out .
we &apos;re waiting on the dad &apos;s labs ,
but i couldn &apos;t sit there and listen to those two
bite each other &apos;s heads off anymore .
mm . me , neither .
brian &apos;s labs came back clear . how &apos;s micah ?
looks like a grade iv splenic lac , possible rupture .
we need to prep him for ex @-@ lap .
what ? he &apos;s crashing .
crap .
oh , crap !
his pressure &apos;s bottoming out .
hurry up ! he &apos;s in v @-@ fib . we got to bag him .
one , two , three .
easy .
where is that crash cart ? i need those paddles .
almost here .
there &apos;s no time .
got a rhythm .
edwards , you and wilson go and prep that o.r. , please .
magical .
told you .
what ?
nothing .
get going . move .
ruby , do you guys have straws in the kitchen ?
no .
a pen , maybe ?
a ballpoint pen ?
anything ?
not yet . lines are down because of the earthquake .
they &apos;re trying to triangulate from the cell towers .
how &apos;s the mom ?
okay . wait ! wait . we got milkshakes on the way here .
got a straw !
great . now , we &apos;re gonna need you to get a --
what ? what ?
i don &apos;t want to ask her to do this .
ruby , we &apos;re gonna ...
we &apos;re gonna need you to get a knife .
not a big one , but a sharp ...
y @-@ you were making s &apos;mores ? are the skewers there ?
y @-@ yes . got one . oh , god .
you want me to stick this into her , don &apos;t you ?
ruby , you can do this . you can . it &apos;s gonna help your mom , okay ?
we just need you to find the --
second intercostal .
i don &apos;t know how to explain that to her .
wait , wait , wait .
um ... ruby .
okay , um , touch your mom &apos;s left collarbone ,
the one that looks like a wing , coming out from her neck .
now walk your fingers down from it .
two steps . you got it ?
okay . one . two .
stop .
now slide your finger right underneath that rib .
and with your other hand , right above that finger ,
push the skewer in about an inch .
i can &apos;t do that .
ruby , yes you can .
what if we &apos;re wrong ?
i &apos;m not wrong .
okay . ruby , you can do this .
she could puncture her heart .
she won &apos;t . ruby , right now .
oh , god .
ruby , push . hard .
push hard . push hard . right now .
aah ! oh , my god ! oh ! there &apos;s blood !
she -- she &apos;s bleeding ! - it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
now take the -- take the straw
and put it over the skewer into the hole
that you just made and push hard .
she &apos;s breathing a lot !
you did it .
thank god .
wait , wait . she stopped .
her lips are going blue again .
ruby , put your fingers on the right side of her neck ,
right by her throat .
do you feel a pulse ?
no .
okay .
ruby , i need you to get on top of your mom
and put your hands on her chest and push hard right now .
okay , i &apos;m gonna teach you how to do cpr .
all right , let &apos;s take a look .
yikes . that hip took a hell of a pounding .
oh , ethan , you have no idea .
could you please zoom in on the right femoral prosthesis ?
sure thing .
twice in one day , dr. pierce .
yeah . careful , or you &apos;ll get sick of me .
unlikely .
yeah , see that ? there .
her femur distal to the stem is cracked .
her hip isn &apos;t gonna resolve on its own .
she needs surgery .
although , oh , i guess the femur fracture isn &apos;t displaced .
maybe i could put in a plate to bridge the fracture ,
go in from the side .
it would be a little less invasive .
and less time in the o.r. ?
oh , a lot less , actually .
good , so she could stay on her blood thinners ,
substantially lowering the risk to her heart .
and she can get back to getting her freak on .
i &apos;ll let her know .
i &apos;ve been taking the stairs , by the way .
since this morning , you know , just in case .
oh , i wasn &apos;t -- i wasn &apos;t serious before . i was just --
yeah , i know .
i &apos;m not actually taking the stairs .
oh . okay .
i would like to take you out , though , sometime .
maybe for coffee ? or a drink ?
or ... ?
the point is , i &apos;m flexible .
this is coming out all wrong .
i &apos;m gonna start over -- - no , no ,
it &apos;s -- i &apos;m gonna stop you , actually .
i &apos;m sorry , ethan .
you seem really ... tall and nice .
but i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m not ...
i don &apos;t ...
sure . that &apos;s okay . i understand .
okay .
this is basically my office ,
so , if you &apos;re waiting for me
to make this less awkward by leaving , i ...
oh , right . of course . okay .
i &apos;m gonna get out of here .
take this with me . bye .
is karen around ?
she went to get snacks .
how &apos;s micah ?
actually , uh , we need to talk to karen .
sorry . legally , we can only talk to the legal parent .
are you serious ?
who cares ?
dani !
what ?
they didn &apos;t have turkey , so i got a ham and swiss .
ugh . nast .
lovely . really ?
they have news on micah .
micah &apos;s stable ,
but i &apos;m afraid his injury is worse than we thought .
his spleen is ruptured , and he &apos;s lost a lot of blood .
he had a cardiac episode in c.t. , and his heart stopped beating .
but we &apos;re taking him to surgery now .
we do have to remove his spleen .
oh , my god .
what were we doing up there ?
why did i let you talk us into that stupid ski trip ?
karen , come on . i @-@ it -- it was an accident .
but he didn &apos;t want to go .
there was an earthquake .
karen , come on . for god &apos;s sake ,
this is -- i @-@ i didn &apos;t plan on any--
okay , so we will give you an update
as soon as micah is out of surgery .
he &apos;s 14 .
he &apos;s 14 !
this couple might be the
biggest casualty of the earthquake .
oh , my god !
ruby , you &apos;re doing great .
my battery &apos;s at 5 % .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m getting tired .
you can do this . just keep pushing .
push , push , push , over and over ,
like the beat of a song .
uh , ruby , do you know the song &quot; stayin &apos; alive &quot; ?
is it new ?
uh , we &apos;ll sing it for you , okay ?
and you just -- you push to the beat , just like this ...
stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
ha , ha , ha , ha , stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
ok , ruby . you sing now . sing with us .
they found the region .
ruby , did you hear that ?
help is on their way . they &apos;re gonna find you .
stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
some of the roads are blocked .
they &apos;re sending a helicopter ,
and they don &apos;t know how long it will take .
okay , ruby , you just keep going until they find you , okay ?
you keep singing , and you keep pushing .
and when they find you ,
u @-@ use their phone and you call me back .
okay .
stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
okay .
stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
stayin &apos; alive , stayin &apos; alive .
ruby ?
she &apos;s gone .
they &apos;ll find her .
she &apos;ll call . they &apos;ll find her .
yeah , she could be on her way in right now .
unless she &apos;s alone in a cabin with her dead mother .
she &apos;ll call .
anything ?
she &apos;ll call .
did you hear the mom going at that guy ?
that couple is doomed -- all that fighting .
i do not miss that .
look at us -- we &apos;re both in adult , stable relationships .
for once , we &apos;re on the healthy side of things .
sure .
i had to cancel d.c. , but it &apos;s okay .
sometimes he cancels , and i say it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;re happy . we &apos;re in a groove .
kind of sounds like a rut .
we are not in a rut .
whatever .
i resent you saying it .
okay .
and you &apos;re hardly an expert at long @-@ term relationships .
really ? and that &apos;s not even true .
what ? izzie ?
that was a cancer marriage
that lasted five minutes .
oh , and then there was ava , who peed on my couch .
all right , would you quit it ?
no , there &apos;s one more i &apos;m forgetting .
hello ? i &apos;m right here .
oh , i know . the nurse who had syph .
as in syphilis ? !
it was a long time ago , wilson .
relax .
bovie .
it &apos;s not a rut .
i have an entire world to manage , all on my own .
my world does not and should not
revolve around derek shepherd .
i wanted to go to d.c. this weekend ,
but i &apos;m a busy surgeon with two kids at home ,
and he &apos;s at the n.i.h.
so right now , we &apos;re just going to have to accept
that this is the way our lives work .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re not happy .
all right , fine . you have a happy marriage .
with no husband in it .
all right , plate &apos;s in position . i &apos;ll be placing the screws next .
her pressure &apos;s good . rhythm &apos;s stable .
so ... you and ethan . is that a thing ?
oh , no . i &apos;m not -- n @-@ no , he &apos;s not my type .
sure . right .
you &apos;re not so into cute , smart , or funny ?
no , he is . i mean , he -- he &apos;s great .
he &apos;s , um -- he &apos;s a radiologist .
whoa , whoa , whoa . did -- did you just go all upstairs / downstairs ?
no . no !
no , i didn &apos;t mean it like that .
no , i just -- i don &apos;t date at work .
or you don &apos;t date down at work . no , no , it &apos;s cool .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure you have many other fine qualities .
it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re kind of a snob .
oh ! i am not a -- god , you make me sound awful .
&quot; dating down &quot; ? what is that even ?
i @-@ i just don &apos;t date people who are --
beneath you ?
no , that is not what i was going to say .
underlings ? - no , stop it . i wasn &apos;t gonna say --
just a lowly maker of x @-@ rays , madam .
i didn &apos;t mean to ... will you stop it ? !
and we &apos;ll use the rasp to smooth out the bridge .
you know , mrs.thurman could come out
looking like a completely different person .
so that she can be happy
with what she sees in the mirror .
but what if it &apos;s not her nose that makes her unhappy ?
i mean , maybe it &apos;s some other part of her life , like --
like that patient with her boyfriend &apos;s boobs .
how can you be sure that she &apos;s making the right choice ?
you do realize i can &apos;t talk to you
about your sister &apos;s case , right ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not asking about my sister &apos;s case .
i @-@ i &apos;m asking about this lady right here .
all right , well , i know she &apos;s making the right choice
because i talked to her at length , and i listened .
and i &apos;ve ... gotten very good at knowing .
44 @-@ year @-@ old female -- vitals stable ,
tension pneumo relieved by a needle thoracostomy .
is she okay ? is she -- - trauma from the fall .
her pupils are fully responsive .
gcs of 8 .
yeah , i got this .
ruby ?
hey .
my phone died ,
but i kept singing till they came , just like you said .
i know . i know .
you did great . you were perfect .
you &apos;re okay .
you are charged with first degree felony murder .
how is she ?
subdural hematoma with a shift .
what can i tell ruby ?
nothing . not yet .
heart rate &apos;s dropping .
damn it .
drill -- now .
i need to evacuate this clot .
what can i do ? let me help .
let me work .
mrs. thurman &apos;s awake .
good .
she looks like she &apos;s been in a bar fight ,
and she says she can &apos;t wait to see what she looks like
when the swelling goes down .
what else ?
nothing .
it &apos;s a big change .
she &apos;s had that nose for plenty of years .
i just -- i hope she doesn &apos;t regret it .
it was not a new thing , this change that she wanted .
it wasn &apos;t a whim .
it was how she had always seen herself .
her best version of her .
the one that was the most true .
now , with a patient like this one ,
a patient who &apos;s dreamt about these changes
since they were 6 years old --
those patients do not change their mind .
for them , change isn &apos;t elective .
it &apos;s not a choice . it &apos;s a chance .
it is her chance .
and you can &apos;t know that without talking .
and listening .
it &apos;s not because he &apos;s a radiologist .
okay , and it &apos;s not just because i don &apos;t date people from work .
i just -- i kind of don &apos;t date .
hey , listen .
i was just giving you a hard time .
no , no , no . - i didn &apos;t --
there &apos;s a gap between me and most people .
there just always has been .
i used to think it was because i was younger in school ,
but even after school ...
... the gap -- it just got bigger and more impossible .
i wasn &apos;t too young . i was just too ...
different .
so i know what it looks like when i say yes to ethan .
it &apos;s fun , and we &apos;re happy for a while until it &apos;s not .
things always get awkward and weird .
so i overcorrect , or he misinterprets .
and then we &apos;re not on the same page anymore
because we never were on the same page .
we were always miles and miles apart with this gap between us ,
pretending it wasn &apos;t there .
i don &apos;t want to pretend .
i came here to work and just stay focused on that ,
and i &apos;m fine on my side of the gap .
i &apos;m a little lonely , but ... fine .
there &apos;s just no point to me saying yes .
yeah .
okay , that &apos;s a load of crap .
uh , when you were younger , fine .
kids are weird . but now ?
you &apos;re a grown @-@ up doing your grown @-@ up job
with other grown @-@ ups . there &apos;s no gap .
and -- and there &apos;s -- there &apos;s nothing to lose .
there &apos;s just you being scared .
and for no reason .
so choose not to be .
life &apos;s too short to be scared . screw the gap .
let ethan -- i don &apos;t know -- razz your berries .
okay , goose your gander .
okay .
tickle your tail feathers .
cup your coconuts .
nope .
rock your rump .
poke your hontas .
wallop your wonderland !
there &apos;s still bleeding from the short gastric arteries .
i can &apos;t .
close to the pancreas .
i see it !
well , i can &apos;t get to it from here .
how many units did he use ?
four units .
if everyone would just shut up
and give me two freaking seconds ,
i can get this suture to hold .
there . edwards ?
no leaks . looks good .
the streak &apos;s alive .
what was that , wilson ?
oh , no .
wait , nothing . i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t -- i didn &apos;t say anything .
you said , &quot; the streak is alive . &quot;
no ! no , i said , &quot; freak . &quot;
i said , &quot; the freak is alive . &quot;
no , you didn &apos;t . no , she didn &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t hear anything . i ...
you &apos;re pitching a no @-@ hitter .
you haven &apos;t lost a single patient since november 14th .
89 surgeries in a row with good outcomes .
did you say november 14th ?
yeah , a @-@ and 22 were traumas .
i mean , who -- who does that ?
you , because you &apos;re magic .
edwards , you can close . wilson can assist .
what did i tell you ?
look , i told her not to tell you .
this kind of thing messes with your head .
i &apos;m on a streak .
there &apos;s no such thing . it &apos;s just dumb luck .
look , you &apos;re not that great , anyway , so just forget about it .
no , no , no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s the date that it started .
what about it ?
that &apos;s the day that derek left .
and i &apos;ve been perfect ever since ,
have not lost one patient --
not one -- since the day he left .
what does that tell you ? that you &apos;re right ?
that i &apos;m better off without him ?
brian , your repeat labs look really good .
i should be able to discharge you very soon .
how &apos;s micah ?
not my kid . i know .
karen won &apos;t even speak to me right now ,
and , uh , you know , i had all the best intentions .
i was trying to bring the family together .
i thought i was helping us .
it all backfired .
maybe now we &apos;re too far gone .
maybe i can &apos;t get karen back .
maybe danielle is right .
maybe karen and micah are better off without me .
all i wanted was for us to be happy , be a family .
can you just nod
or blink twice or something
if micah &apos;s okay ?
thank you , dr. grey . thank you .
you know , you should try and close your eyes , get some sleep .
it could still be a while .
do you think i hurt her ?
no . no . ruby , you did everything right .
you don &apos;t know that .
how is she ?
she &apos;s fine . ruby , your mom is gonna be fine .
really ?
absolutely .
so , uh , i called my sister and checked in .
a bookcase fell .
but other than that , she &apos;s fine .
good . okay .
i owe you an apology for what i said earlier .
yes , you do .
and i will consider accepting your apology ,
ben warren , if you make it up to me .
at home .
you can , uh , start by making me dinner .
and then some other things that
i haven &apos;t even thought of yet .
well , um , you know i &apos;m still on call .
i can wait .
six weeks , right ?
eight just to be sure .
ease back in .
herbert isn &apos;t gonna know what hit him .
or edward .
or ... maybe that guy upstairs with the bad toupee .
lucky guys .
i &apos;m telling you , girls .
you have healthy hips . put them to good use .
hold that ! wait , please !
hi . i will have that drink with you .
if you want to , if you still want to .
great . let &apos;s do it .
wait . now ?
do you mean now ?
no . yes ? i don &apos;t know .
end of the week ?
yes .
thank you . for today .
oh , you &apos;re welcome .
so my streak lives on ?
sure . if you believe in that stuff .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t need derek .
i don &apos;t need him in my house .
i obviously don &apos;t need him
to prove i can have 89 good outcomes in a row .
i &apos;m doing great .
my kids are happy . my career is soaring .
derek going to d.c. did exactly what it was supposed to do ,
which is remind me of who i am outside of my marriage ,
which , by the way , i &apos;m kind of amazing .
okay .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i don &apos;t want to share it with him .
i want to tell him that i &apos;m --
we &apos;re on a streak .
i can handle micah &apos;s post @-@ op if you want to take off .
that list of things you &apos;d grab in a disaster .
hello ?
hi . is he in the lab ?
what ?
i know this is derek shepherd &apos;s phone .
who is this ?
your kids , your keys , your family photo album .
who is this ?
that list goes out the window ...
who is this ?
hello ?
... when the disaster starts with you wondering
if this must be the woman who &apos;s been screwing your husband .
that &apos;s a whole other earthquake .
