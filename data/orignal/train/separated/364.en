Tucker, no.
No...
Don't.
Tucker, no.
Tucker, no.
No.
Get out!
Get out. Get out.
It's comin', man, it's comin'!
It's beautiful, ain't it?
The wrath of god himself!
Just wait, man!
I finally got him down.
He still feel warm?
Uh, the ibuprofen must have kicked in.
Ah, it's that preschool.
Place is like a petri dish.
I thought you had a few days off.
What's the case?
It's about some missing kids.
I guess you gotta go in, then, huh?
Please don't walk away like that.
We've talked about this.
I know this is hard on you.
Henry, too.
On all of us. Look, if I had someone to cover my shifts, I would.
What if it was Henry?
Don't.
It's not Henry. Henry's right in there.
What if it was?
You'd want someone out there looking for him.
No, I know. You're right. It's just...
Things worked better when you were at the Pentagon.
I wasn't helping anyone there, Will.
You worked normal hours and weekends off.
Fine. I'll tell them I can't come in.
Don't do that.
I was supposed to have time off. Henry's not feeling well.
It's all right. You should go.
I'll take care of it.
Really, I got this.
I'll see you when you get back.
You don't have to be here.
Ah, I get antsy when I'm gone too long.
And thanks for the team's donation to ALS in Carolyn's name.
She would have appreciated it.
So how are you doing?
I'm ok.
It's funny, though.
We were divorced 20 years.
And I never missed her as much as I do right now.
Hey, you.
Welcome back.
Good to be back, Penelope.
We're ready when you are, sir.
The bodies of two unidentified boys
Were found near Wichita, Kansas, a week apart.
Both were caucasian and between the ages of 15 and 17.
They were each found mangled in the aftermath of a tornado.
Yeah, but that's not what did them in.
The M.E. Has determined
that the cause of death was blunt force trauma
To the head before the storms hit.
Well, the death blow in each case
Was in almost exactly the same spot.
Now, what about all the other damage to their bodies?
Some of their limbs are missing.
Yeah, victim number one, his right leg was taken off.
Victim number 2, both arms were severed.
But was that because of the tornado or the unsub?
The M.E. Still hasn't discovered that. He's a busy guy.
Major storms have hit the area. 23 dead. The morgue is slammed.
It fits the unsub. He's got a hell of a sadistic streak.
Well, a tornado would clear the air
And give the unsub the privacy to do his thing.
He may be using the storm as the body disposition modality.
Forensic countermeasure, wind, hail, rain,
Mother nature destroys the crime scene.
Or he wants us to think
mother nature actually committed the murders.
What concerns me is the brief period between kills.
Only a week. He's moving fast.
We need to move faster. Garcia, tet me I.D.s on all the victims.
I'm a gale-force wind.
Wheels up in 30.
Oh, and pack for foul weather.
The forecast is nasty.
The national weather service has issued a tornado warning
For Sedgwick County, Kansas, at 9 P.M. Meteorologists...
Yeah, we're back! Told you!
You owe me 5 bucks.
Better pay up this time.
"For the man sound of body and serene of mind,
"There is no such thing as bad weather.
"Every day has its beauty.
"And storms which whip the blood
Do but make it pulse more vigorously."
George Gissing.
Central plains.
Right in the middle of tornado alley.
If this unsub is using tornadoes as a forensic countermeasure,
Then Kansas certainly is the ideal setting.
Tornadoes do pose a significant threat.
During this year's super outbreak back in April,
There were 336 confirmed tornadoes in just several days,
Resulting in over 300 lives lost.
Hey. Tell us something good, mama.
Ok, so local P.D. have I.D.'d your victims.
I'm putting this all on
your tablets if you'd like to follow along.
First up is Jason Meredith, 16-year-old runaway
From Garden city, Kansas. Mom said he took off over a year ago.
Next up is Eric Janelle, 15-year-old foster kid from wichita.
He's been gone 3 weeks.
Oh, both of these kids have records
For possession and prostitution.
They were street hustlers.
At-risk kids. This could be a sexual predator.
An extremely violent one if the unsub is responsible
For the damage done to the bodies,
especially those missing limbs.
Well, now, he could be
keeping the body parts for some sort of fetish.
Oh, ok, eew. That is my cue.
I'm here if you need me with my binary machines
That don't say gross things.
I didn't know you were a bad flyer.
I'm not. I just hate turbulence.
You know, turbulence very rarely causes planes to crash.
That does me absolutely no good at the moment. Thank you.
What we really need to worry about are microbursts,
Sudden downbursts of air associated with thunderstorms.
But a small craft like this, if we hit one of those
At the wrong altitude-- pulverized.
I beg of you to make him stop.
A tornado outside Wichita killed 2 and injured 9 last night.
The twister, which classified as an F2 on the Fujita scale,
Is the latest in a freak series of storms
To hit late in the season.
More harsh weather is expected
As officials prepare for the worst.
The guy was torn up pretty bad.
Thought we'd find his arms, but we never did.
Found him right over there.
Well, the unsub definitely has his own mode of transportation.
This is way off the beaten path.
And the first victim, Jason Meredith,
was found over 30 miles away.
You say you were able to clear this place before the storm hit?
I didn't know you could do that for tornadoes.
When we get enough lead time,
we try to clear all the mobile home parks.
The last place you want to be in a twister is in a trailer.
We close off the main roads, too.
Ok, so the unsub either found a way in
Or he was already here and he hid during the evacuation.
That, or the body got sucked up into the funnel cloud
And was thrown here from someplace else.
Either way, he came into close contact with this storm.
Maybe even close enough to put himself in danger.
Or he waited someplace safe for it to pass
And came back and dumped the body.
No, I think the storm
itself actually means something to this guy.
You don't think he's just using it to cover his tracks?
I played ball in college with a guy from Indiana.
He said he and his boys used to get drunk and then chase storms.
Said it was the closest they could get to the true power of god.
I saw an F3 when I was in high school. He wasn't kidding.
Ok, so he's impulsive, probably young,
Maybe a loner with nothing to lose.
We should be looking at actual storm-chasers.
Where can we find them?
They mostly work with the university.
You think this guy's educated.
Well, he knows enough
about the weather to use it to his advantage.
So far it's working.
Here you go.
When was the last time you saw Jason?
The day he ran away.
A little over a year ago.
He came and he hugged me just like he always did
Before he went to school.
Do you know why he would leave home?
His father, Ray.
He used to beat on me.
On Jason, too.
And how did Jason cope with that?
He'd always try to protect me.
Even when he was a little guy,
He always really fought back.
Sometimes if, afterwards, if I was crying,
He'd just come and he'd sit there and hold my hand.
So it sounds like you and Eric were pretty good friends.
Those other kids ain't too cool at that house.
Your foster mom said that you used to get in a lot of fights
Before Eric got there.
That's my boy.
Nobody messes with me
'cause nobody messes with him.
So he looks out for you.
Yeah, we look out for each other.
When was the last time you saw him?
About 3 weeks ago.
He said he was running to the store
And never came back.
He in some kind of trouble or something?
We found him a couple of days ago.
He took the news about Eric pretty well.
Tough kid.
I guess they have to be. They're all alone.
Each of the victims had a strong protective instinct
And was looking out for somebody else besides themselves.
Maybe the unsub is keying in on that.
Boys like that are hard to fool.
What if he used to be one of them?
I mean, those kids would see
right through someone trying to be a poseur.
If his M.O. Is connected to the weather,
he's gonna try to grab another boy soon.
There's a major system expected tonight.
What's up, guys?
Where can I get some beers?
Quickie Mart. Take a right on main.
Sorry, man. I'm not from around here. Where's main?
About 4 blocks that way.
Thanks.
Hey, uh, any of you guys want to party?
Got some tuss. A little weed, too.
How about you?
Come here, buddy boy. It's all good.
He's too young.
It's 100.
I got 50.
And I'll thrown in a couple of sixers for you and your boys.
Heh heh. Come on, man.
Let's get in. Let's go have some fun.
Every slab in the house is full.
Could you hold that?
We have two weeks over.
Can't apologize enough for the delay.
4 years of med school, most of the time it's old folks,
Heart attacks, and strokes.
Now, I'm from New York.
Not a whole lot of action out here in Wichita.
Your guys are right here.
Identical blows to the head.
Well, that's what tipped me off,
Not to mention they're both John Does.
Kids this age get claimed fast.
They had alcohol and dextromethorphan in their systems?
Cough medicine.
Yeah. You see it with a lot of kids.
It's a cheap high, free if you can steal it.
And these two had a whole lot of it on board.
What were you able to
determine from all the damage to the bodies?
Well, it's mostly consistent
with tornado casualties I've seen before.
Lacerations, abrasions, massive internal trauma.
Mostly?
Well, their limbs. Those are chopped off.
I'm guessing with an axe or a cleaver.
Yeah, a dull one by the looks of the tissue damage
At the stumps.
Cut off postmortem.
Oh, definitely, but only minutes after they were killed.
You see the discoloration?
The decomposition begins
almost as soon as the blood supply stops.
They both have ligature marks on their wrists and ankles,
At least what they have left of them.
Good eye. Those are all actually antemortem.
They're from restraints.
He held them before the kill.
Was there any sign of sexual assault?
Inconclusive. All the damage made it impossible to tell.
So, he gets them drunk and high,
He restrains them, kills them,
A cleaves off a limb as a souvenir.
Then he dumps the body and lets the storm clean up his mess.
But why the souvenir?
What or who, exactly, is he trying to remember?
The national weather service has issued a tornado warning
For Butler county, Kansas.
A large, violent storm moving west at 40 miles per hour.
Ok, time to go.
...this large and destructive tornado.
Take cover immediately.
This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation.
Come on, let's go!
Knock it off!
We gotta go!
Don't worry, buddy boy.
I'd never forget you.
Double or nothing I find us another one?
What, you scared to lose again?
All right, then, gentleman's bet.
That's my boy.
Never seen anything like it.
Name's Gary Dyson.
16. Runaway from Kansas city.
A couple of my guys have seen him before.
I.D.'d him off the tattoos on what's left of his arms.
This particular area get hit with a tornado last night?
Thunderstorms came through.
Warnings went out, but no twisters.
The weather's gotta be the trigger.
He's following the patterns.
We track the storms, we find the unsub.
Forensic evidence has been washed away.
But behaviorally, it's the most intact crime scene
We've encountered so far.
It's the same blow to the head, but no cuts, no abrasions.
Except he's missing his torso.
It was only a matter of time before he missed one.
Tornadoes are extremely unpredictable and sometimes
Last only a matter of minutes before they dissipate.
The fact that he was able to leave his previous victims
Directly in the path of one is astounding.
So the conditions were perfect last night,
but his tornado never came.
It's only been 4 days. He's accelerating.
And the weather's driving him to do it.
Guys, we know that fetishists
are loyal to the body parts they take,
But I think that this unsub is loyal to the whole of these parts.
If you were to take the
missing pieces from all the victims so far,
You could almost assemble an entire body.
So he's not taking bodies apart,
He's putting one together.
We're looking for a white male in his mid- to late-20s.
He's mobile and he travels great distances to follow storms.
He's probably in a truck or a van.
We believe he may live in that vehicle.
It's probably beat up,
Maybe rusted from the elements.
Sorry.
Jeffrey Dahmer, serial killer,
Was under the delusion
they he could create young male sex zombies
That wouldn't resist his advances.
And when Dahmer's test subjects died,
He kept their body parts as souvenirs.
Skulls, hearts, even genitalia.
Restoring body parts is no small task.
They're gonna get ripe fast.
He needs lots of ice, salt, maybe, something to preserve them.
And he's paying for all that stuff somehow. Gas, too.
He doesn't have the social skills to hold a job for long,
So he's most likely a day laborer, handyman,
Anything transitory.
We think he's using the weather
As a forensic countermeasure to destroy evidence,
But we also think he might be some sort of symphoraphiliac.
Sorry, symphora what?
Uh, excuse me.
Symphoraphiliacs-- they're sexually aroused
By disaster.
Usually fires or traffic accidents.
In this case, the weather must enhance his excitement.
He hunts street kids, so he may be from a similar background.
And he's most likely uneducated,
But he's still charming enough to engage his victims.
We'll talk to the press. You should warn any transient kids
You might know. As this weather gets worse,
So will the unsub.
All right. Let's get to it.
Since when is a seizure fine?
The doctor said it's normal for kids his age.
But his fever broke.
Yeah.
It's back again.
Did you give him his medicine this morning?
No. He was ok.
Did he feel warm?
Well, you checked, right?
JJ, of course I did.
What are you trying to say?
Nothing. I--
Where is he now?
He's resting. I'm just waiting for some paperwork
And then we're gonna go home.
Ok. I'll call you when my flight arrives.
You don't have to do that.
Henry's sick.
I'm coming home.
Call you later.
What's wrong?
Uh, it's Henry.
He had a febrile seizure.
Will took him to the E.R.
He--he's fine.
Apparently it's totally normal.
Look, I gotta get back home.
Of course. Anything I can do?
Can I borrow the jet?
I think the budget oversight committee
Might not appreciate my generosity.
Yeah, well, worth a shot, right?
Check in and let us know everything's all right.
Ok.
Hey, Hotch. I've been thinking--
The vast majority of unsubs with this type of M.O.
Aren't driven by the killing.
They're really fascinated by the body parts.
Psychologically they exist
in a realm where fantasy meets delusion.
It's basically the perfect
blueprint for the creation of a serial killer--
Yes. I'm rambling, aren't I?
Yes.
Should probably get to the point.
I think I know how this unsub may have gotten started.
All right, the first victim was found missing his right leg,
The second, both arms, and the third had no torso.
So that leaves the left leg and the head unaccounted for.
We can assume the head would be the most difficult piece to find.
That part would have to fit an unsub's fantasy perfectly.
So he'd most likely save it for last.
Now, what that tells us is there's a victim out there
We haven't found yet who's missing his left leg.
Or the unsub hasn't acquired it yet.
True, but most body part collectors evolve to this level,
And in many cases they exhumes bodies for parts
Before they start killing.
All right, let me call Garcia.
So you think our unsub did the same thing.
P.G. At your service, don't let the name fool you.
Baby girl, you're on speaker.
Garcia, can you look for grave robberies in tornado alley
Over the last 5 years?
Okey-dokey.
Searching.
Oh. That's a shockingly big list.
Who knew grave-robbing was so on trend?
How many of those involve the bodies of teenage boys?
Uh...none.
What about morgues and funeral homes?
Momentito...
Again, that is a list that should not be that big.
Mostly stolen embalming fluid, though.
It's often used like pcp, Garcia.
I'm feeling optimistic about the youth of america.
There are no teenagers involved in this either.
All right, try looking for thefts involving body parts,
Specifically left legs.
Ok, eew! See, this is why
I can't talk about how my day was at dinner.
Breakfast, lunch.
Spencer, you scare me.
Join the club.
A left leg was stolen off a body a year ago
At the Riggio funeral home in Tulsa.
They never found who did it.
Garcia, what was the weather like in the area at the time?
Uh, thunderstorms and tornadoes.
An F2 cyclone hit right around there,
And then the robbery took place after they evacuated.
It's gotta be our unsub.
Wait, there's more. The guy whose leg was stolen,
He was a 47-year-old father of 2 who died of leukemia.
That's a huge jump.
Preferential child sex offenders don't usually
Stray from their preferred age range.
It's not about the sex at all. He used the body
From the funeral home to develop his M.O.
So he could live out his fantasy and kill in a storm.
It still doesn't explain what or who he's building.
Whatever it is, this unsub won't stop
Until he finds a perfect head.
That's the final piece to his puzzle.
Hey! What's up, guys?
Do you need a ride or something?
Uh, no, man, we're good. Thanks.
You sure? It's kind of wet out here.
Yeah, yeah, we're good.
Come on, man. It's raining buckets.
Hey. Get off me.
Hey, man, it's cool. It's cool.
Come on.
Hey! Fellas, I was wondering,
Can you tell me the best way to get to I-135?
Yeah, it's back that way.
Thanks.
Appreciate it.
I'm from Oklahoma.
I don't get up here much.
So there's nothing?
Um, ok, what about out of Kansas city?
No. No.
Um...ok, thanks.
Hey. Thought you were out of here.
Ohh. Flights are canceled 'cause of the weather.
How's Henry?
He's headed home. Finally released him.
That's great news.
Where are you guys off to?
To the university to talk to some storm chasers.
Stay dry.
Yeah, right.
Who's that with Hotch?
There's been another abduction.
A boy named Shaun Rutledge. That's his younger brother Billy.
He says a young white guy in an rv
Attacked him with a crowbar in the rain.
He's also changed his victim selection criteria.
The boy he grabbed gets straights As,
Plays football, even volunteers at his church.
So he wanted him so badly, he was willing to leave a witness?
Which suggests he's losing touch with reality
And his delusions are starting to take over.
What is it about this kid that was so attractive to him?
He was teenage and caucasian like the others, right?
We also think that a sexual element may actually not be at play.
So then what the hell is driving this guy?
Maybe it's love.
What if he's trying to recreate someone he loves?
It is an emotion that drives us to extremes.
If he's trying to recreate someone,
It's probably somebody he loved and lost.
Wait. You said he was with his big brother, right?
Holla at your girl.
Baby girl, I need those great big beautiful brains of yours.
Jazz hands ready. Gimme.
Ok, look at all the teenage male victims or tornadoes
In the last 10 years. Same geography as before.
That would be male, 13 to 18--42.
How many victims had younger brothers that survived?
Uh...10.
The unsub might have been a high-risk kid.
Garcia, how many of the survivors have criminal records?
I got two for you.
First up is 27-year-old Justin Harris,
Had a DUI in 2008.
Next is 22-year-old Travis James.
Ooh, little troublemaker.
Shoplifting, possession, and prostitution. Oh, my.
And all when he was a minor.
You got a home address or a vehicle registered in his name?
Uh-uh. None.
You got a photo on this guy?
It's on your tablet right now.
All right, this is a composite sketch
From the description the kid gave.
I don't know why you put up such a fight.
We're gonna be brothers, man.
Me and you, against the world.
Old school.
There. There.
Oh, my god. This poor kid.
In 2001, Travis James lost his big brother Tucker
And his mom Jan when a Tornado hit the McCleary trailer park.
In Enid, Oklahoma.
That's just south of here.
So our guy's a local.
Everybody just sit tight.
Oh, that's great.
It's gonna kick in.
Hang on, Garcia. The power just went out.
Garcia, I think we're good. Keep going.
Sometime before this evil tornado touched down,
Travis, along with 5 other boys,
Testified against a one Roscoe Gulch.
For what?
It appears that this Gulch character
Was a notorious pedophile in the area,
And he was a resident of the
same trailer park as Travis and his family.
I'm looking at police reports now.
It looks like brother Tucker had confronted
This Gulch person lots of times.
He even broke the creep's nose once.
He was protecting his little brother.
Ohh. And then the plot thickens.
According to a statement from Travis,
Right after Gulch was acquitted,
He and his brother went to Gulch's mobile home.
It's gonna be ok.
A fight ensued.
Travis said it was like his big brother went crazy.
He was upset about the acquittal
And dealt some justice of his own.
Travis said he heard tornado sirens.
It's a tornado! Get out of here!
Tucker, look out!
He then ran to a drainage pipe nearby.
After that, Tucker and Gulch somehow got trapped
In the mobile home when the twister hit.
Travis said he saw the mobile home
Get swallowed up by the tornado.
And when he came out there was nothing left.
Garcia, how old was Tucker when he was killed?
17.
He was found in pieces.
It took his DNA and dental records to I.D. Him.
Travis went into foster care and he was reported missing in 2003.
He ran away.
10 years ago his brother got ripped apart,
And now he's trying to put him back together?
But why start killing now?
Garcia, send me current weather reports for the area,
Including radar images if you have them.
Ask and you shall receive. It is on your tablets.
With the weather in the area,
he's going to be so excited, he won't wait.
He'll take the boy to the closest area with the most activity.
That's right around here, just southeast of us.
It's Frankenstein.
创造了一个怪物
What?
The unsub isn't just trying to put his brother back together,
He's trying to bring him back from the dead.
He believes that tornadoes have the power to take life,
So conversely, they should have the power to restore it.
We'll pick up Rossi and Prentiss on the way. Let's go.
Uhh! Damn it!
Damn. I need a beer.
You want one?
Ahh, nothing like a cold one to take the edge off, right?
You sure you don't want one?
It might make you feel better.
Garcia, what have you got?
Sir, I found your trigger. A year ago,
A tornado ripped through a cemetery near Tulsa.
One of the 53 graves that was disturbed
one of that was Tucker James.
His brother was killed by a storm,
Then his memorial was destroyed by one.
Now he's using both to build a memorial of his own.
Now that he has that boy's head,
The delusion will completely to take over.
Garcia, those storm chasers at the university we talked to,
They should be out in full force.
I'm sending you their number now.
Tell them to be on the lookout for the unsub's RV.
And, Garcia, patch into their radio chatter.
They'll know where the storms are.
On it, my pretties.
Come on, get it together.
We're gonna have fun, bro.
Like before.
Remember that time we stole mama's bourbon?
Rode our bikes, what,
10 miles to go see them girls?
God, what were their names?
You thought you were gonna get laid.
And that chick. Puked herself so bad,
I thought I'd die.
Do you remember that?
Hey. It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna do this thing tonight.
Why do you keep fighting, you dumb son of a bitch?!
You know what?
Here, I'll show you.
The national weather service has issued a tornado warning
For Sedgwick county in kansas at 9 p.M. Central daylight time...
Ok, man! Here we go!
What'd I tell you?
We need to head into those areas with the most precipitation.
So make a right at the next intersection.
It should be Pawnee Road.
Hey, how exactly are we supposed to chase this storm?
The unsub won't actually chase the storm.
To get close to it, you have to get in front of it.
It's a little like playing chicken.
What?
It's frozen.
Hey, Hotch.
We just lost the internet.
I'm frozen up, too.
The weather must be affecting the upload.
I'm patching Garcia in.
Yes, boss.
Garcia, we just lost our internet
And we need you to guide us into the storm.
Consider me your eyes and ears, sir.
Yeah, it's beauty. It looks like a landspout.
Great funnel on that one. She's heading north.
Ok, guys, a twister has been spotted near Rose Hill
Just south of your position.
The storm-chaser dudes are calling it a landspout.
We don't want that one.
Landspout tornados are relatively insignificant.
Where to, then?
Garcia, look for hook echoes on your monitor.
Hey, hook echoes. Yeah.
Ok, I'm gonna do that. Just tell me what they are.
They're swirling hook-like radar signatures
That look surprisingly like what you'd expect them to.
Ok. Uh...
No, I don't see anything like that.
They'll likely form in those red and violet areas
On the map.
I don't see anything
Even remotely like that.
Ok, they shouldn't be far from our current position.
He's close.
Oh, god.
Wait, wait.
Yes! Yes, I see it.
Oh, that's gotta be it. Yes, ye--
Where, Garcia?
Oh, no, no.
What? What is it?
There are two.
We'll have to split up.
Which way, Garcia?
Uh, ok. Half of you can stay
In your current heading.
The other half, make a...
Right on Meadowlark Road.
Morgan, take Meadowlark Road. We'll keep going.
Got it.
Hey, I just got a hit from the storm-chaser dudes on the RV.
You guys are the closest.
Where are we talking, Garcia?
Heading east on Sumner Road
Just north of your position,
Make a left on Prairie Creek. It's the next left.
You got it.
Hang on, guys.
It's gonna come right through here.
I know it.
Just wait, man. Whoo!
I'm coming, buddy boy.
I'm coming.
What are you doing?!
It's almost time!
You gotta stay still, dude.
Trust me, it's all good.
We ain't got time for this. It's coming now!
You want the hard way or the easy way?
What's that up there?
Near the old house.
No! Who are they?
Travis James, FBI!
Put the weapon down!
You get back!
We can't do that, Travis.
I said get back! Are you hard of hearing or something?
Just let Shaun go and we can work this out.
That's his name, you know.
He has a little brother, too.
We know you saw them when you attacked them.
Just go! Get out of here, please!
Travis, Tucker would not want this.
He would want to protect you like he did with Roscoe Gulch.
That bastard was guilty!
Just let him go and we can help you.
We don't need your help!
I'm telling you, we need to get to cover now!
Come on, man, put the weapon down!
Put it down!
We gotta go!
Let it go!
Me and you, man!
Here we go!

So the weather's supposed to break tomorrow.
I should be home sometime in the afternoon.
I'll call and let you know for sure.
Did you at least catch the guy?
Yeah. Sort of.
It's kind of weird.
You all right?
I'm--I'm fine.
It's just...
Been a really long day.
Listen, I'm really sorry about everything.
Yeah, me, too.
So, uh, is he still up?
Yeah, he said he's not going to sleep
Till you read his story to him.
Headstrong little guy. He's exhausted.
Hang on.
Hey, buddy.
Guess who's on the phone.
Mommy!
Hi! Hi, little man.
How--how are you?
I heard you, um, you went to the doctor.
Are you coming home, mommy?
Not yet, buddy. Tomorrow.
I promise.
So, are you ready for story time?
Yeah!
Yeah? Ok.
Daddy, are you ready?
"Bedtime for baby star."
Once there was a baby star,
He lived up near the sun.
And every night at bedtime,
That baby star wanted to have some fun.
He would shine and shine and fall and shoot
And twinkle, oh, so bright,
And he said, "Mommy, I'll run away
If you make me say good night."
And then his mommy kissed him on his sparkly nose and said...
"No matter where you go,
"No matter where you are,
"No matter how big you grow,
"And even if you stray far...
"I'll love you forever,
'cause you'll always be my baby star."
Good night, mommy.
