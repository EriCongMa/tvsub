And heels down.
This hurts.
Pain is only in the mind.
Right leg up, and flip your dog.
It feels like my leg.
Back to downward dog.
My mind has a cramp.
You know the guy that keeps smiling at you -- Jorge?
He just broke up with his girlfriend.
Really?
Mm-hmm. Double date tomorrow night.
No!
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Sorry.
What does he do?
Medicine.
Shh!
Oh, all right.
Rizzoli.
Okay.
Mindful awareness
is what can subdue the primitive consciousness
and bring the physical body under control of the will.
I totally agree.
I have to go.
Yeah, you can't leave before savasana.
Corpse pose.
Maura, let's go.
Thank you.
Namaste.
Come on!
You got her to do yoga.
No, it was my idea. I love yoga.
We had to leave before ardha chandrasana.
I feel very unbalanced.
She was dragged here.
Oh, that's all been photographed and inventoried.
Gaynor-Randle. 32.
ATM $100. Scratch robbery.
Did you find what was used to beat her?
Not yet.
Vintage. She had a flair for clothes.
Hm, she was sexually assaulted.
Reddish-brown stains on the inner thighs and external genitalia.
I hear an echo.
She was married.
Pager's totaled.
It's not a pager.
It's a glucose-management system -- insulin pump.
She was diabetic.
Yep. Needle sticks.
She probably had to check her glucose level
about 5 to 10 times a day.
Maybe this.
Yeah, she kept careful records.
Her last glucose-level reading was over 400.
Is that good or bad?
It's extremely high.
Is that good or bad?
Bad. She wasn't getting any insulin.
She probably had slurred speech, trouble walking.
That explains why there's no defensive wounds.
She couldn't fight back.
Murder weapon has a rectangular edge on it.
I can't confirm that.
Hey, Frost, we're looking for a 2x4 --
Frost, we're looking for an idiot.
That your way of saying you want to talk to the husband?
What's it say about relationships
that the husband or the boyfriend's our first suspect?
Are you getting ready for an "I hate men" speech?
I like men, just... not the ones that kill.
Jane.
It may not be the husband.
Because she didn't have a husband.
We're sorry for your loss, Mrs. Randle.
I prefer "Mel."
And it's Gaynor-Randle.
We took each other's names.
The Commonwealth recognizes our marriage.
I have a right to know who did this.
Of course you do. We want to know, too.
When was the last time you spoke to her?
5 o'clock, maybe?
Did she always work late?
Always... on my night out.
I'm the, uh, captain of the LGBT Bowling League.
Lesbian-gay- bisexual-transgender.
Uh, what time did you get home?
About 10 o'clock.
I called Katie's office, her cell.
By midnight, I was calling the E.R.
and you guys over and over again.
You can check with my alarm company, my cell records...
...the bowling alley.
We will have to verify your whereabouts.
Understood.
I suppose it's always the first suspect.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Oh, come on. It's not like she has to worry about the scar.
Don't rush me.
Well, multitask, then. Time of death?
The core temperature I took hepatically was 88.4 degrees.
Killed between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M.
Jorge say anything about me?
Yoga Jorge?
No, Jaunty Lube Jorge.
Oil change? I don't go there.
Total rip off.
Maura, come on. What'd he say about me?
He said, "Sure." when brock asked about having a double date.
No, I'm not going.
Oh, Jane.
What about DNA substance from the sexual assault?
No semen, but I did collect some deerskin fibers.
So we're looking for bambi.
No, deerskin from apparel.
W-- moccasins, a tepee?
No, tepees are generally constructed from buffalo hides.
W-- wow you are so literal.
But deerskin actually has great tactility.
Small pores make it soft, tough --
work gloves.
So no prints.
Oh!
What?
Jorge thinks you're hot.
Forget it.
Come on, Jane. Listen to me.
Every time he looks at you,
he contracts his orbicularis oculi and pars orbitalis.
Gross.
It's facial muscles. Please.
Only if you tell me what killed her.
There should be more blood associated with her facial lacerations.
I'm gonna have so much fun on my couch, alone.
And it looks like the assault and the rape happened post-mortem.
What, she was raped and beaten after she was killed?
So what killed her?
I don't know yet.
Well, I don't know when I'm gonna have time for dinner.
An adrenaline response to panic overstressed her heart,
which was already compromised by diabetes.
So, why rape and beat her once she was dead?
Look at this.
"Merch."
Means "Girl" in Welsh.
Since when do lawyers have club stamps?
Yeah, she came in Monday nights like clockwork.
She was here last night.
Did you see her leave?
It was packed.
Did you see her, uh, with -- with her wife?
No, but she talked about her.
I mean, it seemed like a -- like a good relationship.
As far as marriages go.
Yeah. We have that in common.
Rob was here last night. He worked the door.
Last name?
Thatcher. It's not him, though.
I checked him out before I hired him.
He's clean enough to squeak.
Detective Rizzoli. This is detective Frost.
You know her?
This the dead chick?
Yeah.
I heard about it on the radio.
Yeah, she slid up in here right before happy hour ended.
Drinks go up after 7:00.
Did you see her with anybody?
We have a lot of good-looking ladies here.
Did you see her leave?
No. Sorry.
God, I hate this.
If she'd just gone someplace else,
she'd still be alive.
Why? Cause it's a lesbian bar?
Yeah.
I didn't take these psychos seriously.
It's Massachusetts. Same-sex marriage is legal here.
Can we take this?
Yeah, it's yours.
Thanks a lot.
If you think of anything...
All right.
Escalating threats.
Desecration of Katie's body.
Looks to me like we got ourselves a hate crime.
Uh, "sons and daughters of Adam."
That's your catchphrase, isn't it?
I'm offended to see sacred words
associated with pornography.
How about associated with murder?
I-I think it's interesting
that they sent a female and an African-American
to interview me about a homosexual murder.
You don't like women or African-Americans either?
Well, I have a right to my opinion.
Only if you don't enforce it with a 2x4.
We're gonna need to see a list of your members.
Oh, surely. I came prepared.
Those are all members?
We're national.
Satan is using homosexuals to destroy the kingdom of God.
Be on the lookout for a man in a red cape
with a tail and pointy ears.
I will pray for you.
No, thank you. I'll do it myself.
And, so, this drunk, with a knife,
is outrunning my old partner, Korsak.
He finally catches up to him.
He grabs him by the shorts -- true story --
And...they rip right off.
Please tell me he's wearing underwear.
No. No, he's not.
No.
No.
So, that was my first week on the job.
I got to tackle a naked guy.
Nice.
Yeah.
I think that sounds like fun.
Anyone for some, uh, dessert, some coffee?
Actually, it -- it's getting kind of late.
You know, I think I need to use the ladies' room.
Oh. Jane?
Hmm?
Will you join me?
No, no, no. I don't need to go.
I think you do.
I need to go to the ladies' room,
If you'll excuse me.
Please.
What are you--
Oh!
Shh! Come on.
I thought you needed to go to the restroom!
That was a ruse. Well, do you like him?
He's sexy.
Mm, yeah, I think you should take him home.
Maura.
What? You said he was sexy.
Well, just because I like the way he looks in yoga class
doesn't mean I'm gonna like the way he looks in my bed.
Right.
But did you know that sex releases immunoglobulin "A"?
It wards off colds.
No. Not tonight.
A-and I didn't shave my legs.
Nice try.
What kind of person are you?
You're like a racecar...
Finely tuned... Beautiful...
Fast...
I'm not that fast.
Hey! Wow, look at you.
Aw, I should take her for a walk.
Hm? Okay.
Let's take her for a walk. Come here, little boo-boo.
Come on. Okay.
Uh, Maura said that you're in medicine.
Are you a doctor?
No.
Uh...E.M.T.?
Nurse.
A male nurse. That is so cool.
You should get the biodegradable ones.
Right.
Uh, so, what happened between you and your girlfriend?
Oh, we didn't agree about kids.
Oh, she wanted them, you didn't?
No.
I just love the idea of being a stay-at-home daddy.
But she wanted to stay home, too.
Someone's got to work, right?
Yeah. Wow. I'm surprised.
Why? Because I'm Hispanic?
It's a new world.
See, I am looking for a really strong woman.
Someone who knows how to hold warrior, too.
Like you.
Come on. Let's go. Come on.
Coming?
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go for our walkie-kins. So much fun!
Really?
That bad?
I thought you said you couldn't lie.
What do you mean? I can't.
You did.
Only one time,
when I said I'd finished my homework and I hadn't,
and I immediately went vasovagal.
Fainted.
Jorge's in "medicine"?
Technically, yes, he is.
What's his specialty? Lactation?
Orthopedics.
Joe Grant was a detective, he was sexy,
and he was a perfect match for you.
Well, I kind of liked him.
Yeah, well, you butted heads with him
until he moved to Washington.
So you hooked me up with Nurse Jorge.
Wh-- I -- I just -- yes.
It's not funny.
Hey. Anything come up on those background checks?
Still waiting on that, uh, bouncer from the club,
and no red flags on anybody here.
Somebody's got a boyfriend.
Someone should mind his own business.
What -- no.
Your eyes are like pools of midnight!
No! Come on.
What? What?
Your-r-r lips are like...tempur-pedic pillows.
Really? Just give this.
"Dinner. Saturday.
I'm already in the kitchen. Jorge."
Sounds kind of sissy to me.
Hey, guy cooks.
Yeah, I know.
It's a match.
Excuse me?
The bouncer.
"Robert Thatcher" -- it's an alias.
Real name is "Roy Tompkins."
So, that's why he lied. Look at this.
Outstanding warrant -- New York City
for criminal sexual assault.
Come on.
Hey, Roy. We need to talk to you.
Oh. I wouldn't do that, Roy.
Been holdin' out on me, Bruce Lee!
We can do this all day, Roy.
What happened to Katie?
Look, I can't tell you what I don't know!
What is so important?
Jorge dropped off lunch for you.
That's not why I interrupted you.
I extracted the killer's DNA from the murder weapon.
Who is he?
Well, there was no match in codis, but it's not a "he."
It's a "She."
The killer's a woman?
The deerskin fibers are lifted from the murder weapon.
Were off the killer's glove?
Seams were breached,
and DNA tests confirmed that the sweat was from a female.
Yeah, we already know that,
and a male accomplice raped her.
No, injuries are consistent with
a non-biological phallus-shaped object.
You mean a dildo?
Yes, I believe that is the popular term for it.
But did you know that a 28,000-year-old stone phallus
was recently found in a German cave?
Ice-age men were using it for knapping flints.
Yeah, ice-age women were using it for making sparks, too.
Yeah, okay.
So, if she wasn't raped, it's probably not a hate crime.
It wasn't a robbery.
I'm beginning to think this was personal.
I wonder if Jorge read the Chump study.
Chump study. Probably wrote it.
Chocolate happiness undergoing more pleasantness study.
Yeah, I-it actually concluded
that chocolate makes us happier.
Chocolate from Jorge makes me sadder.
Flowers.
Flowers have been shown to reduce depression.
Come on, Jane. Jorge's a catch.
If you don't want 'em, can I have 'em?
Jorge? Yeah, he's all yours.
Maybe if I get fat, he'll stop calling.
I just think if you allow him
to see all sides of you,
then he'll stop calling.
You know what?
I just heard what that sounded like, and that is --
what I meant to say was that...
human beings have good and bad traits, you know,
a-and you have, you know...
some characteristics that are a little...
n-not as, um --
Wow, fudge clusters.
Katie was deleting her...
search history on her computer.
Why? What was she hiding?
Have we checked the wife's alibi?
Solid.
Tracked all her calls -- E.R., 911.
Alarm company confirms she activated her home alarm
at 10:03 P.M.,
didn't break the circuit again till 6:17 A.M.
She didn't do it.
How do you know?
Got Mel's scorecard from the night of the murder.
She's a hell of a bowler.
She had a turkey.
Why would she do that?
That's three strikes in a row, Maura.
Oh. Wish I could get her for our team.
But you got to be divorced.
Can you try to restore all that history that Kate deleted?
Let's give it a shot.
Really yummy.
Sorted by popularity.
Hmm, spent a lot of time on Cupid4girls.com...
Lipstidate.com.
Online hook-up services.
So, Katie was cheating on her wife.
Somebody posted a message for her the day she was killed.
"Liked our time at the Merch. Want to play again?"
Our vic was having more than a drink after work.
Can you trace the I.P. addresses?
Smart.
What?
They set up the website to hide all I.P. addresses --
protects their customers.
Yeah, and hides the cheaters.
Why work so hard to get the right to marry --
To do the same thing that straight couples do?
I don't know.
Hey, Korsak.
They kind of...
resemble each other.
Jane and the victim.
You're right. Be a shame to waste an opportunity like that.
No.
We could...
No way.
We could try and bait a trap.
Post the same kind of message Katie did,
attract the same kind of woman.
Arrange dates, get DNA,
see if we get a match.
How? We stick a fork in 'em?
You buy her a drink,
you take the glass.
Club owner seemed like she'd cooperate.
Jane could...possibly... wear a wire.
No.
No, I'm not gonna go undercover
to troll for lesbian dates
on the random chance that we catch a killer, no.
I think she loves the idea.
Me too.
Why do they do this?
The categories are such stereotypes.
"Femme," "Boy next door,"
"Sporty," or "Fine."
Jane's definitely "Fine."
I'm just saying, for the purposes of the ad,
you know, to draw the best response.
Yeah. Right.
Okay, I-I j-just have to check a box,
so, "Femme," "Butch,"
"Lipstick," "Chapstick,"
"Sporty."
I've seen her break a chair
over the head of a meth-crazed gangbanger.
So..."Butch"?
Yeah.
I mean, she took him out.
No. No, no, no, no.
She's -- no, no. She's my friend.
I-I'm not putting "Butch."
She's -- I'm putting "Sporty."
Just check what the victim checked, huh?
Oh. Let's see. "Lipstick lesbian."
I love undercover.
"Nice and supportive" doesn't mean weak.
Please.
Jorge...
is more submissive than my dog.
Aww, yes, he is! Aww!
Maybe I should be a lesbian.
Aww, well, wishes can come true.
Frost and Korsak wanted to fill out your dating profile.
I typed.
You what?
If it wasn't for me, you'd be "Butch."
Y-- you put my photo and profile on a gay-dating website?
It's your best shot at getting DNA and breaking this case.
No, it's our best shot.
You're going with me.
No.
Yes, Dr. Isles.
W-- I don't have time to train a female detective
how to collect and preserve DNA.
W-- you're going.
There. Look.
All these women think you're hot.
You realize one of these women
could be Katie's killer.
And not this one. Listen.
She likes to hike, has season tickets to the Celtics.
What?
Front row? Oh, I might flip for that.
I don't understand online dating.
People reveal too much about themselves.
"I want to connect with someone
who can make me more of who I am."
..."Who can be strong without needing me to be weak."
I wonder what kind of women we would like
If we liked women.
What?!
Well, um, first of all, I would be the guy.
That's a cliche. Why would you be the guy?
Because.
Because you're bossy?
So are you.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
You're just soft and polite
When you're bossing people around.
Well, it's a good thing you're not my type.
What do you mean I'm not your type?
That is so rude.
Well, you don't know how to relax.
And you wear your shoes and your clothes to bed,
and you just admitted that you're bossy.
Okay, yeah. I'm bossy. Right.
You put my picture and profile on a gay-dating website,
and I'm bossy.
Right. Okay.
After I said no, by the way.
What are you doing?
Meditating. It's too stressful to argue with you.
Well, just think --
because of you, by this time tomorrow,
I could be on a date with a killer.
Yaaay.
It's okay, buddy. It's just me.
What are you doing here?
I guess I fell asleep while I was meditating.
Well, at least you don't snore.
Oh, well, you kick.
No, no, no. That's not me.
That was Jo. She runs in her sleep.
Myoclonic contractions.
Dogs have dog dreams.
Maybe we should take a look and see if --
if anybody else signed up to hook into you.
That's not how you say it. It's "Hook up with you."
Whatever.
"Whatever"? I'm the one hooking up.
Well, pretending to.
That's easy for you to say.
I can't believe I'm actually hoping
that the killer wants to meet me.
Damn it. Jorge.
Jorge, Jorge, Jorge...
Jorge.
Oh, in case I missed his first e-mail...
and his 10th -- Jorge.
He's so nice.
God.
Maybe that's what you need.
You need somebody... loving and supportive.
Like a hamster.
Jane.
What?
Well, I mean, y-- what you think of as a "great guy"
is an average woman.
You know, I mean,
if I wanted someone to walk the dog with me
and talk about my feelings, I'd be gay.
You're not gonna say that to him, are you?
I will if you don't.
You got me into this, so get me out of it.
Please.
What?
Now I understand why you always look like this.
Excuse me?
You have nothing to wear.
This is completely appropriate.
Mm. You know, I-it's perfect.
Where exactly am I going to hide the camera and the wire?
I know -- in my thong.
Well, maybe you could wear a brief.
No.
Mark Twain said, "The clothes make the man."
He also said, "Naked people have little or no influence."
This is very serious.
Maura, come on. I-it'll be fine, all right?
W-we're trained professionals. We know what we're doing.
We've actually been undercover a few times before,
so, um... let me handle this.
Okay. It's fine. You don't want my help.
It's like trying to dress a squirmy 6-year-old, anyway.
Everything's too short, too itchy.
"I can't walk in that."
Maura, we all love the fact that you dress
like you're about to strut down a Paris runway.
It's -- it's...interesting.
It's endearing.
Sexy.
It's, uh, it's-- it's fashionable.
Oh, so -- so that's what you think?
You think this is all about fashion for me?
This is gonna be good.
No? I-I-it's not about fashion?
No, it's not.
What is it about, then?
I used to sit at the musée d'orsay for hours
and just stare at it.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes, the Rizzoli family vacations there every summer.
Have you ever tried to appreciate...
Euler's number "e"
You know, the beautiful equation
that connects three constants of mathematics?
Have you?
Yeah, I tried it once.
I am in awe of what human beings can do.
I am in awe of the hand-knit channel stitching
on this sweater.
I am in awe of the artisan
who molded and shaped this shoe.
I cannot wait to see what you're gonna wear.
There's a back room that way. Just...
Why don't we do it right here? Yeah?
Guys must eat you up.
Why? Why do you say that?
Because you're just like them.
Beautiful... Dominant energy.
If you ever feel like getting adventurous...
I'll give you a call.
Dr. Isles is...
...not very doctorly.
I mean... at all.
Your table's ready, Miss.
Oh, my god. Put this on.
No. I'm undercover. Follow me.
Oh, my god.
I'll be right back with your drink.
Thank you.
There she goes. First date.
I finally work up the nerve, you know, and call them.
I get the machine.
So I go, "Mom, dad...
I'm gay!"
How'd you do it?
I...
Ladies, may I get you something to drink?
No. We're good.
May I take that for you?
We're good, right, Miranda?
My real name's Mary Anne.
"Hi, mom, dad. I'm gay."
Whatever happened to "call me back"?
I mean, you leave your most personal information
on an answering machine.
A friend of mine asked for a divorce by texting.
No manners anymore.
Yeah, you had it down.
So much more polite to serve divorce papers.
I always fall for girls like you.
Like what?
Oh, smart, tough...
...complicated.
Mm, my hands are sore from... volleyball.
You're gonna break my heart.
They get right into it.
All they talk about are their feelings.
They're women.
Oh, and you're -- you're an expert?
I been married 20 years.
To three different women.
So?
So, that's not a very good track record, detective.
Yeah, look where you're spending your Friday night, Romeo.
Oh, real ladies' man.
Rizzoli's good at this.
At what? Being a lesbian?
Yeah.
No! Shut up. I'm listening.
No, you're not. You're talking.
Oh, my god!
I like tall brunettes.
I'm Jane.
I know. I saw your profile.
I'm Claire.
Uh, can I get you another drink?
No, I've had enough to get brave.
The next stage is "weepy."
That's okay. I don't mind.
She is creeping me out.
Rizzoli?
No, the other one.
This is gonna freak you out,
but you kind of look like that girl who was killed.
Katie... Somebody.
Did you see her picture in the paper?
Yeah.
Yeah, it's -- it's so scary, isn't it, that...
it could have been any of us.
You want to hear the weirdest part?
Yeah.
I think I was her last date.
Really?
Reel her in.
Did you tell the police?
No. No, I don't know anything.
W-we chatted online, met up here.
We really hit it off. Then I saw her ring.
I don't hook up with married women.
"I don't hook up with married women"?
She's saying she doesn't cheat.
Is that cheating?
Are you serious?
Well, what was she like?
I really liked her.
She shouldn't have lied about being married.
And if she hadn't...
she might still be alive.
Thanks.
None of the allele frequencies correspond
to the DNA isolated from the 2x4.
The blood on the weapon didn't match any of my dates?
W-- not even Claire?
No.
Hey.
CSRU went through Katie's papers.
Look at this.
Hey, our vic inherited half a million dollars
while she was still single.
She keeps it in the event of a divorce,
but if she dies...
It all goes to the grieving widow.
Hell of a consolation prize.
Widow's got motive.
Yeah, but she's got a titanium alibi.
She can prove she was bowling.
You know, Katie was very careful about controlling her diabetes.
I counted nearly 100 needle sticks.
So it just doesn't make any sense
that she wouldn't know she needed insulin.
Maybe she did. Was the pump working?
It was so compromised, I can't tell.
What if -- - I don't like sentences that begin with "What if."
Let's assume --
Why is that better?
That Katie tested herself, her numbers were high,
she gave herself some insulin --
Or what she thought was insulin.
No, b-because I tested the residue in the pump --
pure insulin.
Her tox screen came back negative.
No signs of poisons in Katie's body.
Unless...there's something
that couldn't be detected in her bloodstream.
If somebody put something in the pump...
there should be fingerprints on it.
It's clean. Okay.
Why aren't Katie's prints on it, at least?
Someone might have attached it to her body
and wiped it clean.
That's good.
I'm just guessing.
All right, so, Katie's regular insulin pump
was switched to one full of poison.
She thinks she's giving herself insulin.
She's actually killing herself.
Who had access to Katie?
Mel, the wife
who was at home when Katie was being beaten.
She had an accomplice.
Mm-hmm.
Smart killer, because it's impossible
to prove without evidence.
Which we don't have.
Yet.
Katie was here with women,
so, obviously, she was cheating.
Did you know her wife, Mel?
Well, I run a bar, not a church.
You know that, right?
Come on.
All right, well, did Katie ever mention anything
like she thought mel was seeing someone?
No, she never did.
Sorry.
Hmm?
No, I'm done. Thank you.
Well, um...
You have my number?
Yeah, I do.
If you have any new thoughts...
You know, you said if I was ever feeling adventurous...
Yeah?
Yeah.
I need you to swab my neck for DNA.
I'm not even going to ask why.
You have 10 seconds. There is a bus coming at you.
You can either be on it or under it.
That cop is fishing. Stay strong.
Yeah, I had to stand there and watch Katie die.
You know --
Hey. Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
It's okay.
You weren't there. She was -- she was so sick.
What did you put in that pump?
Fentanyl. It can't be detected.
Mixed it with water, swapped out the pumps.
What if we screwed up?
We didn't.
Look, we get the money in 90 days.
I --
Shh. It's okay, baby.
Hey, wait. What about the fingerprints?
You left prints?
No, that's what I'm worried about.
Katie's prints should have been on the pump,
but there were no prints.
Wait, how do you know that?
Because she decided to get on the bus.
Arms behind your back.
Same old story -- kill your wife for the money.
How could you do this?
This...is as adventurous as I get.
Crap. Maura. Maura.
Hey.
Hey!
Look, I-I just want to say that I...
support your choice, Jane.
Okay.
Thank you.
And thank you for the flowers and the chocolates
and...the lunch.
And the car battery, even though mine was fine.
Sure. You're welcome.
Glad we live in a state that women like you can get married
if that's what you want.
Okay.
You told him I was gay.
No, he assumed. It's different.
Okay, let's begin.
Feet shoulder width apart. Relax your shoulders.
He assumed?
Just close your eyes and breathe.
And breathe out.
You better hope this calms me down.
Well, I could always tell him you like him.
Don't you dare.
Oh, I wouldn't dare.
Shhhh!
I'm sorry.
Shhhhhh!
I'm sorry.
