you &apos;re not allowed to tell
anyone anything that we say in here , right ?
unless you tell me something that leads me to believe
that you &apos;re a danger to yourself or someone else .
i thought you were getting your own room ?
that was before the pipes went off behind the walls .
they didn &apos;t fix the pipes , so we &apos;re roomies till then .
n.a.t. club ?
jason dilorentis .
n.i.t. club . gary reynolds .
n.i.t. we see all .
looking for someone ?
so which one is &quot; a &quot; ?
what is &quot; a &quot; is a group of people .
they know about us .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before they figure it out .
what is going on ?
i said i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
and i said we have to !
if it weren &apos;t for &quot; isa @-@ hell &quot; the skank ,
my mom would be with my dad right now instead of home alone .
training a horse , it &apos;s an art .
bending its will till it knows your its master .
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna feel when i &apos;m through with you .
there are things that i haven &apos;t told you .
and i need to .
why don &apos;t we do this in my office ?
hey . how is she ?
she &apos;s ... shaken .
is there something you wanna tell me about mr. fitz ?
are mr. fitz and spencer involved ?
what ? no .
yeah , we weren &apos;t sure , we just thought that maybe she--
yeah , thanks .
she &apos;s not at swim practice .
i told you . she &apos;s not allowed near the pool .
guys , all of her clothes are here .
you think she did something crazy ?
like what ?
like jump in her car and burn rubber till she hits texas .
and leave everything behind ? she didn &apos;t even take her phone .
i wouldn &apos;t either if i were her .
&quot; a &quot; had his / her / its hands around her neck
and keeps reminding her !
she hasn &apos;t slept in weeks .
who has ?
hanna , did you not see this ?
is that you ?
yeah , of course it &apos;s me .
well , unless you &apos;re aria &apos;s mom ,
just assume it &apos;s spencer slutting it up .
when did she get that ?
3 : 07 am and it came with a text .
&quot; clue ella in and i &apos;ll let you out , a. &quot;
give me this .
aria , chill .
emily would never send that to your mother .
well , of course she wouldn &apos;t because she can &apos;t ,
&apos;cause we have her phone and she left in the middle of the night !
where the hell is she ?
hi .
i &apos;m ready to talk .
good . come in and join us .
your friends have been worried about you .
em , why didn &apos;t you at least wake me ?
i was sleeping five feet away from you .
i can &apos;t keep asking my friends to take care of me .
emily , look , if you were seriously thinking about goint to texas .
i didn &apos;t have any plans .
i just knew that the longer i stay here the worse it was gonna get .
and i &apos;m not gonna be used like a bowling ball
to knock down my best friends .
emily , we &apos;re sitting here because of you .
none of us think that you--
that i &apos;m the weakest link .
yeah , well , somebody else does .
who ? who &apos;s using you to knock down your friends ?
somebody that &apos;s been trying to hurt us .
for a long time .
when did these threats begin ?
did the texts start coming after alison &apos;s funeral ?
before .
at first we thought they were coming from alison .
but then they found her , her body .
and you don &apos;t have any clue who this &quot; a &quot; person might be ?
we do , but ...
we &apos;ve been wrong before .
&quot; a &quot; is an expert at making other people look guilty .
do we think this person goes to your school ?
maybe , but it &apos;s not like we go home and we &apos;re suddenly safe .
&quot; a &quot; is everywhere , constantly on us ...
like a shadow .
and i &apos;m the first person you &apos;ve told about this ?
why have you waited this long to say something ?
you don &apos;t think we should have mentioned her ?
how could we without spilling everything about that summer ?
it just kinda makes us look like we &apos;re making it all up .
sullivan probably thinks we &apos;re insane .
guys , after the fashion show , even our parents think
there &apos;s somebody out there messing with us .
my dad still wants to sue .
sue who ?
everyone .
hey , did you bring them ?
bring what ?
i &apos;m gifting kate at the rehearsal dinner ,
so she &apos;ll forget i talked smack about her and isabel .
you &apos;re giving her a book of horse pictures ?
yeah , it &apos;s classier than a calendar .
no , classy would be buying something new , hanna .
she &apos;s gonna know that these are used .
no , she won &apos;t , and besides ,
you have a staff that dusts your books .
oh , look , horse doing a wheelie . kate will love that .
hanna , your step @-@ sister wants you trampled by a horse . why are you ...
it &apos;s not about her , okay ?
it &apos;s about my dad .
we &apos;re finally getting along ,
and i &apos;m not about to blow it the week he &apos;s getting married .
it &apos;s not what we agreed on .
do we think that she sent me that picture of aria and fitz ?
yeah , we think she had help from garrett .
yeah , but why ?
it &apos;s not like torturing us is gonna give her back her sight .
plus , the person she really wants to hurt is already dead .
yeah , well , she probably had help with that , too .
no wonder i didn &apos;t recognize you .
grandma .
you have a salad in front of you .
i &apos;ve never seen you eat anything green before .
howdy , girls .
grand , what are you doing here ?
don &apos;t we have a dinner to go to ?
that &apos;s tomorrow night .
yeah , well , i guess i
just ran a couple stop signs , got here early .
i need your house keys .
they got a little girls &apos; room near here ?
yeah , it &apos;s just inside to the left .
oh , perfect .
hanna , come with .
she &apos;ll be right back .
i just need to wipe the dew from my lily .
okay , grandma , no . walking now .
what does that even mean ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m now officially done eating forever .
no , i can &apos;t deal with this right now .
you figure it out .
maybe we should &apos;ve skipped dr. sullivan
and gone straight to the police .
garrett is on the force , em .
jenna got there first .
how long are we gonna wait until we do something ?
we are doing something .
he &apos;s seeing someone who specializes in teen depression .
give it some time .
that someone also suggested ,
given my family history ,
that he see a psychiatrist .
someone who can write a prescription .
again , mike is not your brother .
no , he is related to him .
okay , can we cross that bridge when we get there ?
if we get there ?
we &apos;re there now .
something has happened to our kid , ella ,
and i want him back .
and he will come back .
he just needs a little help finding his way .
and that may not come from a bottle of pills .
here we go again . don &apos;t ...
he needs to talk about his feelings ,
not bury them under medication .
you are not a doctor .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s your call .
i &apos;m not saying that some kids don &apos;t need them ,
they do ,
but one size does not fit all .
i under ...
hey , what &apos;s up ?
nothing .
dad , i thought you had a class ?
what &apos;s going on ? is this about mike ?
no .
grabbing a bite before i head off to campus .
byron , what is happening to her brother is not a secret .
it affects her , too .
your father and i have a
difference of opinion on what to do about mike .
and i &apos;m not taking a poll .
okay , we &apos;ll talk about this later .
so was the ocean freezing ?
okay , caleb , go back . whose wetsuit did you borrow ?
not skeevy .
i &apos;m just jealous of anything getting that close to you .
uh , can i call you back ? my dad &apos;s on the other line .
hey , dad , what &apos;s up ?
together ?
no , no , no , i &apos;m totally into it .
it &apos;s just-- it &apos;ll be fun .
love you , too .
what was that about ?
my dad wants me and kate
to toast tomorrow night at the dinner .
neat trick . are you gonna do it ?
well , sure , why not ?
what is your take on this ?
why is he tying the knot with that woman ?
what do you mean ? he loves isabel .
and like my mom says , he deserves to be happy .
happy ? what &apos;s happy ? cows are happy ,
and they end up as sloppy joes .
hey there , sweetie !
hello , regina .
ah , look at your pretty mama .
all dolled up like condoleeza rice .
turn around .
why are all the bowls out ?
i was just looking for a better place for them .
it just seemed silly that they &apos;re so far from the stove .
um , dad wants me to give a toast tomorrow night .
with kate .
i say skip it .
i vote for skipping everything .
what are you talking about ?
this child does not wanna see
her daddy go through with this , and neither do you .
regina ...
tommy is just waiting for you to take him back .
that is not true .
every time i mention your name , he turns to mush .
tom thinks you hung the moon , ashley ,
and i &apos;ll bet that there &apos;s
someone else here who feels the same way .
right , hanna ?
so this is why you came here early ?
no , i should &apos;ve come months ago .
you &apos;ve gotta fight for your man .
i am not fighting for tom , regina .
our marriage ended a long time ago ,
and hanna and i have made peace with that .
i would appreciate
if you would drop the subject .
stop baiting your granddaughter ,
and put those mixing bowls back where you found them !
thank you very much !
are you lying to yourself , too ?
mom needs you to go downstairs and help get dinner ready .
mike .
close the door !
i said get out !
no . no , i &apos;m not gonna get out .
mike , you need to let somebody in ,
and not some ... stranger online .
who are you even talking to ?
what &apos;s going on in here ?
nobody invited her in .
i tried .
mike , turn off the computer and come downstairs .
i &apos;m not hungry .
did you even eat lunch ?
who cares ?
just close the door , i &apos;m in the middle of something , okay ?
no . you &apos;re done . give me the--
what are you doing ?
let go ! stop it !
mom .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m okay . um ...
when your father gets home , this did not happen .
no . mom ...
i have to tell him
that i tripped on the stairs ,
and you &apos;re gonna tell him the same thing .
mom , you can &apos;t just let him--
no . he cannot know about about this .
this did not happen .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i &apos;m gonna go get some ice , and you need to set the table .
i &apos;m betting it was garrett on the phone ,
and they were probably having some kind of fight .
i &apos;m still wondering why they were both at jason &apos;s house .
maybe the &quot; we see everything club &quot; is back in session .
so what &apos;s jenna , then , their mascot ?
maybe i could find out more .
no . just leave it alone .
please don &apos;t give her a fresh reason to break us up .
it &apos;s never gonna happen .
toby , you say that now , but if she &apos;s joined that club--
spencer ... it &apos;s never gonna happen .
the pressure you &apos;re under at this point can be overwhelming .
choosing the right college , getting in , leaving home--
it can all be scary .
a few weeks ago your principal asked me
to come and talk about some of the tough choices you &apos;re facing .
but how can you make any good choices ...
when you &apos;re not in a safe place ?
many of you don &apos;t feel safe .
you feel like you can &apos;t make a move without someone
judging you or challenging you ...
or worse , threatening you .
bullies have been around
since the first caveman invented the club .
when i was in school the attitude was , kids are cruel ,
but being roughed up a little built character .
today &apos;s bullies can cause a lot more damage .
they have better weapons .
they can keep hitting &quot; send &quot; over and over ,
and hide behind the anonymity of a text or an email ,
which is about as cowardly as it gets .
would it be bad if we ran to the bathroom right now ?
way bad .
why is she doing this ?
these vicious attacks sent through electronic means
may as well be carved in stone .
if you think a college admissions board ,
not to mention a jury ,
won &apos;t examine the evidence , you &apos;re sadly mistaken .
all it takes is for the victims to stop being afraid
and decide to speak up ...
and speak out .
am i the only one who thinks she &apos;s made things worse ?
why would it be worse ?
because she just tore our clothes off ,
basically , in front of the entire school .
she wasn &apos;t betraying us , han .
this is someone trying to help us take down the enemy .
is your phone back on ?
yeah . why ?
well , sullivan finished ten minutes ago ,
and we haven &apos;t heard from the beast . so that &apos;s progress .
or the quiet before the storm .
what are you looking at ?
hmm ? nothing .
look , sullivan &apos;s right . it was time to speak up .
i &apos;ll talk to you guys later .
aria ?
did you go to the assembly ?
yeah , we all did , jenna . why ?
just curious . what did you think of the shrink &apos;s speech ?
too little too late , huh ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it &apos;s just a shame thing . sullivan wasn &apos;t around
when your friend alison was ruling these halls .
i guess it takes one bully to know another , jenna .
could you please move your stick ?
there are people trying to get past you .
clare , alex , i &apos;d like you
to meet my beautiful mother , regina marin .
she drove in from cincinnati .
clare and alex are old friends of isabel &apos;s from college .
i &apos;m sure i &apos;ve mentioned them to you .
no , if you did , i don &apos;t remember .
sure you do , mom .
we traveled to mexico last year .
i showed you the pictures .
i don &apos;t remember names .
do you already have these ?
i can exchange them .
i know i have the receipt somewhere .
no . i like them .
i just felt really bad about what happened at the stables ...
some of the things that i said and how i treated your horse .
i thought he was the one who bit you .
yeah , well , i had it coming .
i &apos;m not exactly proud about
what i said to you on the phone , either .
is there any way that we can just start over ?
i mean , this whole situation is weird , any way you look at it .
totally .
before it was just me and my mom ,
and now there &apos;s tom ...
and a seat always up on our toilet .
should we put that in the toast ?
don &apos;t feel bad . she forgets my name too .
no , i don &apos;t , tom . i &apos;m not senile .
i just already have too many people living in my head .
hey , you two . how &apos;s it goin &apos; ?
um , we &apos;re comin &apos; up with stuff .
that &apos;s great .
you &apos;re speaking just before dessert ,
and if you don &apos;t , my mother will ...
do you think they have anything harder than this bubbly wine ?
could we get two lemonades , please ?
do you want to see the dress ?
the wedding dress ? it &apos;s here ?
i &apos;m its baby @-@ sitter .
wow . it &apos;s awesome .
it &apos;s , like , ridiculous .
here , let &apos;s sit and work on the speech .
you can do most of the talking .
seriously , i &apos;m way better at nodding .
oh , no , you don &apos;t . we &apos;re so in this together .
what is that ?
liquid courage .
was that vodka ?
want some ?
ah , i don &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m not crazy about speaking in front of strangers , but--
seriously takes the edge off .
hit me .
oh , hi . i didn &apos;t even realize you were home .
you hungry ?
are you sure you want company ?
absolutely .
hello .
and i &apos;m the first person you &apos;ve told about this ...
and i &apos;m the first person you &apos;ve told about this ...
and i &apos;m the first person you &apos;ve told about this ...
and i &apos;m--
hello ? ...
told about this .
and i &apos;m the first person you &apos;ve told about this ...
who is this ?
and i &apos;m the first person you &apos;ve told about this ...
and i &apos;m--
what about the windows ?
most devices are planted in the interior walls .
if you &apos;re going to the trouble to bug someone ,
you don &apos;t want to be recording traffic .
are you willing to open up these walls ?
if that &apos;s what it takes , yes .
what &apos;d you find ?
nothing in the hall .
it &apos;s not in the hall . this was taped in this room .
is there any chance that the
client you were treating could have done it ?
no . this was not a normal session .
there were several people in the room ,
the visit wasn &apos;t even scheduled .
maybe if you give us the people &apos;s names ,
we could investigate further--
i can &apos;t . they &apos;re clients .
it &apos;s confidential .
they &apos;re not the ones who made this recording .
you &apos;re sure of that ?
this is the second police report i &apos;ve filed .
this office was vandalized .
if you &apos;re not willing to furnish names ,
there &apos;s not a whole lot we can do .
you &apos;ll get a call from detective klein .
sorry about this . good night .
okay , how does this sound ...
&quot; they say that teenagers
lose their minds when they fall in love ,
and if you &apos;ve ever been around tom and my mom ,
you &apos;d swear they never got out of 11th grade . &quot;
does that make you want to gag ?
no . it &apos;s perfect .
and true .
you just left the planet .
who &apos;s your screensaver ?
yum . what is his name ,
is he coming to the wedding ,
and does he have any brothers ?
caleb , yes , two brothers ,
but they are five and seven .
damn . i don &apos;t think i can wait for them .
oh , crap . what ?
what just happened ?
it &apos;s my uncle roy .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t turn .
just drink up .
what ? !
before he comes over , drink up .
false alarm .
sorry .
we should probably get in there .
we &apos;re cool .
can we get two more of these
and some of that coconut shrimp ?
okay . where would you put a measuring cup
if you were a crazy woman from oklahoma ?
can i just ask ,
why is mr. marin &apos;s mother staying with you
if you guys aren &apos;t married anymore ?
believe it or not , we like each other a lot .
i think she likes me more than her own son .
okay , why would you put
a spatula in the same drawer as a glue gun ?
this ... must be so weird for you .
not really . she gave us a lawn mower for a wedding gift .
no , i mean ... knowing that the person you were married to
is now marrying someone else .
oh . that .
yeah , it &apos;s ... new territory .
but i &apos;m okay with it .
why are you okay
having frozen dinner with me on a friday night ?
where &apos;s samara ?
that didn &apos;t work out .
beyond repair ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s still a lot of questions .
ah . i &apos;ve had those .
i hate to admit it ,
but if hanna &apos;s father hadn &apos;t come back into town ,
i wouldn &apos;t have gotten mine answered .
when the other person isn &apos;t there , sometime we tend to
make up their side of the conversation .
which really isn &apos;t fair to either one of you .
yeah .
i &apos;ve done that more than once .
okay .
i give up . she &apos;s gonna have to make me
a map in the morning .
thanks , emily .
thanks for making a rough night
a little less ... rough .
good night .
hey , there .
hey .
where &apos;s your mom ?
in the shower .
so , has everyone eaten already ?
well , define &quot; everyone . &quot;
mom and i did .
aria , don &apos;t be so unforgiving with your brother .
he may be doing the very best he can .
there &apos;s just a lot of stuff that you don &apos;t know .
and some stuff i wish i didn &apos;t .
hi . you &apos;re home .
there &apos;s a plate for you in the fridge .
that &apos;s okay , i can wait .
so , how &apos;s the wrist ? still swollen ?
no , no , not much .
i think you should have that x @-@ rayed .
no , that &apos;s not necessary , really .
i &apos;m gonna go study upstairs .
um , could you leave that , please ?
hello , maya .
hello , emily .
what ?
i thought i saw something .
you keep your eyes open ?
no , it &apos;s all right . i just --
i thought i saw a shadow in the upstairs window
in jason &apos;s house watching us .
never mind . uh , my bad .
here , come here .
no , no . wait .
there are two shadows up there .
what ?
jason &apos;s not alone .
i just saw two shadows .
garrett &apos;s probably up there watching with him .
oh , spencer .
no , i wouldn &apos;t even be surprised if jenna was up there , too ,
holding the cord while they videotape us
for their perverted little archives .
let &apos;s just go somewhere else .
no ! dr. sullivan &apos;s right .
okay , i &apos;m done running .
they need to know that i &apos;m not afraid of them .
no , no , no , spencer ! no , spencer , wait !
no , no , no , spencer !
spencer , wait !
dad ?
dad , what are you doing here ?
dad , what are you doing at jason &apos;s house ?
we were talking about his fence .
no , you &apos;re done with that .
you set the town &apos;s zoning board &apos;s against him .
let &apos;s not do this , all right ?
dad , i can &apos;t leave this alone !
why are you having secret meetings with this family ,
first with alison &apos;s mother and now with her brother ?
i don &apos;t have to answer your questions .
yeah , you kind of do .
another remark like that , and you &apos;ll be looking for a job .
spencer deserves some answers .
answers ? and just who the hell are you , huh ?
did you take this job at my house so you could stir up trouble ?
dad , stop .
no , you couldn &apos;t wait to run to her
and tell her about what you unearthed in our yard .
it was her hockey stick !
and it was none of your damn business !
none of this is !
now , why don &apos;t you get in that truck of yours
and keep driving , you got me ?
just don &apos;t listen to him , okay ?
spencer , don &apos;t get in the middle of this .
i am in the middle of this !
go to the house . now ! go to the house .
no , no , spencer ! spencer !
get out of the car !
so , you &apos;ve been back since ...
about two weeks .
my parents are renting this house in bucks county .
that &apos;s so close !
forty @-@ five minutes to get here ?
yeah , close @-@ ish .
so , your parents went to texas ,
but you stayed here ?
mommy must trust you these days .
yeah , right .
she &apos;s probably got someone watching us right now .
hey , pam , how &apos;s it going ?
my mom &apos;s not like that anymore .
she &apos;s really come around to me being ... me .
a lot has gone down since i left .
you first .
no , my fault . you go .
i guess i &apos;m just wondering ...
what made you decide to call .
when you were still here ,
i was not in a good place .
i mean , there were things ... people i was afraid of .
i know .
i was one of them .
you were , and i &apos;m sorry for that ,
but i &apos;m not afraid anymore ,
of you , of me , of anyone .
so many things were holding me back ,
but i &apos;m ready now to move on and make real plans --
whoa , em ! slow down . now you &apos;re scaring me .
am i ?
relax .
i &apos;m not leaving before i get my calamari .
mike ?
is mom gonna be okay ?
yeah .
am i ?
yes .
wow . this is so pretty .
you know , i --
i want to live in here , don &apos;t you ?
i guess , if you like the sound of flushing .
can i just say that i was so nervous about tonight ,
but i &apos;m actually having a lot of fun .
i should &apos;ve gotten you a real horse book ...
something big and fat and expensive with ,
i don &apos;t know , pictures of naked boys riding on ...
i need to sit down .
can you bring the sink over to me ?
this dress is fierce .
so fierce .
i just love that color .
i love , love , love , love it .
but it makes my skin look green .
it would look so much better on you .
that &apos;s not true .
it is true !
okay , yeah , you &apos;re right .
hey , you know , do you want to order , like , a pizza or something ?
yes , i will find us something nice and greasy .
i will be right back . don &apos;t go to sleep .
mm . sparkly .
you still want to talk ?
dad , i &apos;m sorry that i ran away .
you remember alison &apos;s grandmother ,
the one who moved down south ?
i never met her , but , yeah , alison talked about her . why ?
well , she passed away a few months after alison disappeared ,
and the dilaurentises needed an attorney .
the old lady had money , a lot .
and apparently ,
a week before alison went missing ,
her grandmother amended her will ,
cut jason out of it .
what does this have to do with you ?
jason &apos;s parents begged me to change the date on the former will ,
the one where the old lady left everything to both grandchildren .
because ?
they didn &apos;t want their son
to look like the number @-@ one suspect .
they had a daughter who was presumed dead ,
and a son who suddenly looked like he had real motive .
my grandmother pours wine in her chili .
i bet she does . where &apos;s the vinegar ?
how much of it do you need ?
well , that depends . anybody here got a bun in the oven ?
what ? gram , gross enough ?
well , i &apos;m just saying , four tablespoons
and you go into spontaneous labor .
how do you think i got your father to evacuate ?
it &apos;s no joke .
tom was trouble from the start .
it was passing a frozen turkey .
patrick was just the opposite .
he just fell out like a gumdrop .
was patrick your favorite ?
i don &apos;t have favorites ,
but if i did i wouldn &apos;t tell you .
would you ever disown any of them ?
your children ?
i don &apos;t own anybody .
there was a war that took care of that .
read a book .
but i &apos;m curious .
what would it take for you
to really cut the cord ?
what if you found out that one of your grandkids
was , like , plotting to sell a family heirloom
and use the money to buy drugs ?
if anybody i was related to was that deranged ,
then , yes ,
our family tree would get some serious pruning .
are you writing a story or something ?
yeah . something like that .
that &apos;s why she went down to georgia ,
to get her to change that will .
who ?
alison . and then she must &apos;ve rubbed it in jason &apos;s face
the night that she disappeared .
that &apos;s why he killed her .
what are you talking about ?
and be very careful what you say .
we should be going to the police right now .
spencer , we &apos;re not going to the police about this ever .
why are you protecting jason ?
i &apos;m not .
yes , you are .
no , i &apos;m protecting myself .
i could be disbarred just for touching that will .
