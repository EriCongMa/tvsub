three years of negotiation .
your government went to a lot of
trouble to arrange for this ... body repatriation .
who is he to you ?
海军特战中心 海豹突击队基础水下爆破训练
how &apos;s that water , tadpoles ?
that toasty enough for you ?
hooyah !
all right , listen up .
look to your left .
look to your right .
that person will not be here tomorrow .
recover .
up here .
bring it up here !
on your belly !
on your back !
make sugar cookies out of yourselves .
recover !
line up .
for any of you
who have had enough ,
we got a truck parked just up the beach .
you can hop on . they &apos;ll give you
a hot , steaming cup of coffee , a warm blanky
and a lift back to the yard .
all you have to do is ring that bell three times ,
and your pain will go away .
how about you , hart ?
you ... you ready to dor ?
come on , hart . ring the bell , avoid the rush .
&quot; i will never quit .
&quot; i persevere and thrive on adversity .
&quot; my nation expects me to be physically harder
and mentally stronger than my enemies . &quot;
what the hell are you doing , hart ?
reciting the philosophy of the navy seals , chief !
no , you don &apos;t have what it takes to be a navy seal , hart .
navy seal is a man .
a man who will lay down his life .
a man who will persevere in the face of adversity .
you are two steps below plant life , boy !
&quot; if knocked down , i will get back up every time .
&quot; i will draw on every remaining ounce of strength
to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission . &quot;
words , hart , meaningless words ,
to a pantywaist , dribble @-@ chin orangutan like you .
&quot; i will never fail . &quot;
move out !
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m saving you from yourself .
leave me alone .
go back to bed .
i said get out of my face .
all right .
i &apos;m trying to stop you from doing something
you &apos;re gonna regret .
hey , one thing . one thing .
everybody drop !
keep your backs straight .
on your feet .
what the hell is going on ?
ensign hart was just polishing the bell
because he &apos;s so motivated , chief .
outstanding .
excellent effort , son .
now , if you two fat ,
pitiable excuses for men are done ,
i want you to bear @-@ crawl back to your bunks
and get the hell out of my sight .
hooyah , chief !
and take the five @-@ mile shortcut by the coast .
i don &apos;t want you to tire yourselves out for the two @-@ mile
ocean swim at 0600 .
hooyah , chief .
hooyah , chief .
i was finished , man .
done !
why &apos;d you stop me ?
your dad doesn &apos;t say much , does he ?
yeah . never a wasted word . why ?
he &apos;s patriotic , too ?
where you going with this ?
why don &apos;t you answer the question ? answer it !
yeah , okay , he &apos;s a flag waver .
came over from ireland with nothing .
now he &apos;s living the american dream .
why ?
last thanksgiving ,
you and your mom were doing the dishes , you remember ?
yeah .
it was just me
and your old man and a bottle of whiskey .
all right , and he opened up to me ,
started giving me this speech about
how a man needs something to believe in ,
something to fight for .
and according to him ,
there was no greater cause than the united states of america .
he said all that , huh ?
yeah , he did .
yeah ? okay ? you know what else he said ?
he said the proudest moment of his life
is when you joined up for seals .
they say every bud / s class has its surprises .
freddie was ours .
after that night , he was unstoppable .
he became the best student , the toughest soldier ,
the guy that everybody could depend on .
he never , ever gave up .
i think some of it must have rubbed off on you .
commander .
we &apos;re pulling chocks in 15 .
time to load the bird .
thank you .
hey , do me a favor .
give me a second with this guy ?
of course .
thanks .
so , how &apos;d the exchange go ?
came off without a hitch .
wow . washington actually did something right .
that &apos;s nice . how &apos;s my boy ?
hmm . well , as well as can be expected .
those two were like brothers .
all right , will you tell him i got a ... big plate of wings
from side street waiting for him here on me , okay ?
roger that .
uh , we land in san jose in about 18 hours .
we &apos;ll give you a call when we touch down . all right .
all right , buddy .
steve , plane &apos;s ready .
steve ?
we &apos;re not going anywhere .
what ... what are you talking about ? why not ?
this isn &apos;t freddie .
okay , if @-@ if this isn &apos;t freddie , then who is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
steve , listen to me .
this trade was brokered at the highest of levels , okay ?
it would seem incredibly stupid for north korea
to try to pull a fast one .
now ,
it &apos;s been a few years , there &apos;s some decomp .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m positive .
this is not freddie .
sir ?
commander . good . come on in .
sir .
you wanted to see me , sir ?
recognize them , commander ?
yes , sir .
the hesse brothers-- victor and anton .
international arms dealers .
we &apos;ve been tracking them for some time , sir ,
but they &apos;re ... they &apos;re always one step ahead .
that &apos;s because they &apos;re being given
sanctuary by some world @-@ class scum .
chechnyan rebels ,
somali war lords , even hostile governments .
and now we &apos;ve got a fix on their location .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
dark sun-- ever hear of it ?
yes , sir .
far east terrorist organization
run by a fanatic named han ji @-@ woon .
the relationship between dark sun
and the hesse brothers is still unstable .
however , we picked up chatter that indicates victor
is sending his brother anton
to finalize a major arms deal with dark sun .
commander , we have a window
of opportunity to roll this guy up .
the first confirmed face @-@ to @-@ face in years .
and the intel is good .
so we need to act now .
excellent .
not so fast .
there &apos;s a discrepancy .
this deal is going down
at a dark sun training compound in north korea .
okay .
aside from the hvt , do we have updated source intel
on how many hostiles inside the camp ,
what weapons they &apos;re using , whether they &apos;re using
roving patrols ?
that &apos;s where i come in . my people will get you
whatever you need .
stealth will be the operative word here , commander .
you want me to insert , snatch up anton hesse ,
exfil the area without getting compromised , sir .
exactly , but bear this in mind .
this mission does not exist .
if you &apos;re killed or captured ,
you &apos;re on your own .
yes , sir .
that means no rescue attempt .
no negotiations .
not even an acknowledgment of your service .
i understand .
steve , we &apos;re not going to send you downrange
all by your lonesome .
pick a team member to go with you .
someone with extensive operational background .
i know just the man , sir .
hey , who packed this chute for you ?
it &apos;s not going to open .
it &apos;s only six miles down .
i &apos;ll grab your legs .
what are you so cheerful about , huh ?
you &apos;ve been grinning like a clown
ever since we got airborne .
i got married over the weekend .
no , you didn &apos;t .
yeah , i did .
kelly and i decided
we just couldn &apos;t live without each other , so ...
oh , really ?
yeah , yeah .
last week , you hated each other .
that was last week .
then we found out we &apos;re having a baby , so ...
it &apos;s a girl .
oh , it &apos;s just getting better and better .
so what the hell ?
you know , i &apos;ve been in love with her since high school .
i want to do the right thing .
never been much of a ring guy .
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;re a sentimental son of a bitch .
thank you . that &apos;s sweet of you , man .
you &apos;re a stupid one , too .
kelly &apos;s got two l &apos;s .
what ? come on .
oh , you can &apos;t read anyway .
what &apos;s the difference ?
you scared me , man .
congratulations , bubba .
thanks , brother .
don &apos;t think you &apos;re not going down next , smooth dog .
i &apos;ve seen you with lieutenant rollins .
that &apos;s the real deal , man .
try not to mess it up .
roger that .
nothing better than this , huh ?
i can think of one thing .
changing dirty diapers .
i &apos;ll get back to you on that one .
all right , daddy @-@ o .
right forearm--
no tattoo , okay ?
that &apos;s how i know this is not my boy .
okay .
okay ?
all right , then where &apos;s freddie ?
he &apos;s got to be where i left him .
all right , steve , this is when we call the state department .
we go through the proper diplomatic channels .
catherine , we &apos;ve done that .
this is where we are . look where it left us .
okay ... what about our people ?
even if i convinced the navy to green @-@ light an op--
that &apos;s gonna mean ten weeks of mission prep .
freddie &apos;s family &apos;s been waiting three years already .
i think that &apos;s long enough .
steve ... i &apos;m going with you .
absolutely not .
well , i &apos;m not asking you for your permission .
it doesn &apos;t matter . you &apos;re not going anywhere .
hey , look , come here .
let &apos;s forego the whole john wayne
&quot; it &apos;s too dangerous for the little lady &quot; speech , okay ?
you &apos;re going to need support .
i &apos;ve done three tours in kabul ,
and i am just as qualified as you are
when it comes to taking care of myself .
yes , you are .
good . then you also know
that i &apos;m not very good at taking no for an answer .
i &apos;m not going to win this one , am i ?
no , you &apos;re not .
okay , fine .
good . now that we got that taken care of ,
how do you plan on doing this ?
&apos;cause all i &apos;ve got is a pack of gum ,
some dramamine and a ready smile .
i &apos;m working on it .
hey , i was just thinking about you .
how &apos;d it go ?
sideways .
what happened ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to find out .
listen , i need you to call in
a marker for me , buy me some time .
how much ?
24 hours .
i can make some calls .
try to delay your bird for a day .
might want to tell me what &apos;s going on .
yeah , we &apos;ll do that when i get back , over a beer .
in the meantime , i got another one for you . you ready ?
i &apos;m listening .
we need a contact for grey intel ,
transpo and party favors .
i was wondering if our old friend
is still operating along the dmz .
last i heard , he was .
all right , how do i find him ?
look for the bar that &apos;s open the longest .
long live the brooklyn dodgers .
i hear music . where are you ?
no , that &apos;s the radio .
listen , i was just calling to say that we , uh ...
we &apos;re not coming back just yet .
there &apos;s something we got to do .
something you got to do ?
what &apos;s that mean exactly ?
i can &apos;t be any more specific than that right now .
okay , uh , hate to be
the adult here , but remember
what happened the last time you were in korea ?
no , just trust me . i got everything under control .
i &apos;ll call you soon .
well , look what the high tide washed up .
what &apos;s going on , frank ?
oh ! good to see you , man .
you look , uh ... you look a hell of a lot better
than the last time i saw you .
hey , i &apos;d like you to say hello to catherine rollins .
oh . l &apos;chaim , pretty lady .
what exactly you drinking there ?
that is snake &apos;s blood and rice wine .
god &apos;s nectar .
it &apos;s also an aphrodisiac .
yeah . 36 hours
of lead in your pencil ,
and doesn &apos;t cost $ 13 a pill .
you know ? that &apos;s too much information , frank .
oh . okay , okay .
we can talk about something else .
you look like you got something on your mind .
we need your help running an errand .
got to hear .
one that involves tangerine .
oh , about that .
what happened ?
honey buzzards .
beg your pardon ?
oriental honey buzzards , a whole flock of them .
what &apos;s the world coming to when your first love survives
missiles , gunfire , rocket @-@ propelled grenades ,
and gets taken out by
a flock of funky birds ?
i am sorry for your loss .
duly noted .
so , what &apos;s this all about ?
the errand that i mentioned involves picking up a friend
across the border .
he &apos;s been waiting a long time to come home .
sounds righteous .
just my kind of errand .
where are we ?
old smuggler &apos;s route .
the end of the line .
best i could do on short notice .
this will work .
it &apos;s good .
follow this trail all the way .
but make sure you stay on the path .
it &apos;s cut through a minefield .
if you make it to the end ,
you &apos;re in north korea .
only problem after that-- heavily fortified
group of terrorists that are not known for hospitality .
if , by chance , you make it out alive , you &apos;re stuck
in a country of 25 million people who hate americans .
good luck .
you all right ?
roger that .
we in the right location ?
we got about three klicks up a 60 @-@ degree slope .
that &apos;s where we &apos;ll find freddie .
let &apos;s move .
you hit ?
i &apos;ve got to keep moving !
the guy in the uniform
by the car .
you see him ?
yeah , you know him ?
we need to grab him .
keep your hands on the wheel . hey !
put your hands on the wheel .
look at me .
you remember me ?
about three years ago ,
you put some bullets into a friend of mine .
he was american military .
now i remember you .
and your friend .
good .
&apos;cause you &apos;re gonna take us to him .
you heard the man .
catherine .
you okay ?
yeah .
where is he ?
shh . shut up . shut up .
let &apos;s try that again , shall we ?
저기 다 .
저기 다 .
dig .
dig !
발하 !
발하 !
how bad ?
it only hurts when i breathe .
it &apos;s just a fractured rib .
i &apos;ll be okay . trust me , your head &apos;s a lot worse .
stop .
stop .
move .
move .
is it him ?
yeah .
steve ?
what is it ?
did you do this to my friend ?
did you mutilate my friend ?
who did that ?
who gave the order ?
did ji @-@ woon give the order ?
was it ji @-@ woon ?
listen to me very carefully ,
you have three seconds to answer my question , okay ?
or everything you did to my friend here ,
i &apos;m gonna do to you .
one ...
... two ...
h @-@ h @-@ han ... han ji @-@ woon .
he ordered us to do it .
where is he ?
back at the camp .
i wouldn &apos;t move if i was you .
cath !
cover me !
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
give &apos; em your gun .
do what they say , all right ?
괜찮아 .
it &apos;s nice to see you again , commander .
and i see you brought another friend .
i got a lot of friends .
right now they &apos;re moving in on this location .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think you &apos;re here alone .
on some ... foolish personal vendetta .
commander hart was already dead .
why &apos;d you have to desecrate his body ?
huh ? you should &apos;ve just taken what i gave you
and gone home .
is that why you sent us the wrong body ?
so no one would find out what you animals did ?
answer my question .
cover me .
steve !
we got to go . now .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go !
look at that , something &apos;s going down .
we got it .
eyes on the package .
let &apos;s move .
how you doing ?
keep quiet or i &apos;ll put a bullet in you .
package is secure .
americans ! americans !
moving .
go . go .
go , move it , move .
fred , you hit ?
i &apos;m good .
i &apos;m fine , keep moving .
get the package out of here , i got your six .
what are you talking about ? get off your ass .
we &apos;re moving . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go !
do the job .
now do the job !
my job is not leaving anybody behind !
you won &apos;t .
look at me , hoss .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
don &apos;t let this be for nothing .
steven .
i need you to do something for me .
no , no , no , no , no .
all right , listen to me .
what are you talking about , man ?
listen to me .
one day ...
... tell my daughter ...
... you tell my daughter that daddy loved her .
promise me .
promise me !
i promise .
all right , i promise .
now go .
hooyah , brother .
moving .
i said get the hell out of here ,
you stupid son of a bitch !
if he hadn &apos;t of covered me ,
i never would have made it out of there .
you did everything you could do .
and you completed the mission .
yeah .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
you don &apos;t look hawaiian .
you &apos;re gonna tell us everything .
but you were born there , weren &apos;t you ?
every terrorist cell you and victor helped arm ,
every supplier you worked with ,
all your trafficking associates .
everyone you &apos;ve ever sold weapons to .
chasing my brother and i around the world for five years .
like a little doggy looking for a bone .
you don &apos;t think we do our homework on you ?
you should get that .
you don &apos;t speak to your father nearly enough .
dad .
hey , champ .
i knew something was wrong right away .
he sounded scared , you know ?
like the day he told me my mother had died .
we stand at attention to honor
the ultimate sacrifice of a son ,
a husband , a father ,
a dear friend : freddie hart .
freddie wished to serve his country by becoming a navy seal .
indeed , it was his greatest desire .
his passion for his work was paralleled only
by his love of family
and the land where we lay him to rest today .
no doubt for those of you that knew freddie ,
there will be long nights to come ,
filled with questions ,
pain , longing ,
anger and confusion .
let us not despair .
instead , let us celebrate
commander freddie hart &apos;s life .
aim .
fire .
aim .
fire .
ready .
aim .
fire .
present arms .
on behalf of a grateful nation and a proud navy ,
i present you this flag in recognition
of your husband &apos;s years of honorable
and faithful service to his country .
steve .
thank you .
commander .
we thank you for bringing our boy home .
it &apos;s my privilege , sir .
i loved your daddy .
and i know he would have loved you very much .
now wherever you go ,
