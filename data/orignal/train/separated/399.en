Criminal Minds S05E02
Ooh it hurts!
Please...help me.
Oh my god! stop!
Take me to a hospital.
Help me!
Stop!
Oh my god stop!
Is everything ok?
Oh god.
Oh god.
Hey you.
How are you doing?
Give me the baby.
Wait.
It's a girl.
Don't! no! let me just--
Give me back my baby!
What's next?
Baton rouge thinks they have a white supremacist problem.
What's your take?
Really?
Yeah I'd like to hear it.
We're dealing with an individual not a group.
Why?
The angry letters.
The writer switches pronouns from plural to singular.
"we are a heavily armed militia "
Followed by "i will be forced to take action."
Good. send it back to the police with our analysis.
What else?
You need to be somewhere?
Um...Henry's just going through a clingy stage.
It's one less 3 a.m. diaper change when I put him down.
Why don't you go home?
Oh no no no. we only have 5 more cases. we can crank 'em out.
We can do this tomorrow. please go home.
Ok. thank you.
I just have one last distribution and I'm out of here.
Good night.
Good night.
Chief Strauss.
Aaron. we need to talk.
Close the door.
I need to review this with the director.
Agent Jareau.
Ma'am.
Hotch.
Yes?
Is everything ok?
Yes everything's fine.
Good night.
Good night.
Reid what did I miss?
Oh man you're not gonna believe this.
Some moron just posted a blog
called "what would Carl Sagan do?"
No Reid the case. what's the case?
What are you talking about?
These emails from Hotch. "take a look at this "
"new case to review."
Emails from Hotch?
I didn't get any emails from Hotch did I?
Nothing.
Come in.
Did you uh get a chance to look at the files?
I just got them. what's so important
You couldn't send it to the rest of the team?
I just needed a second pair of eyes.
I'll review it right now. just give me an hour.
That's not necessary.
We're ready.
Kristie Taylor runaway drug addict
Reported missing from farmington new mexico 3 years ago.
Yesterday she turned up off a freeway
Outside of rio rancho.
Sexual assault combined with ligature marks on her wrists and ankles.
She was asphyxiated.
3 victims in 5 years.
All the women are connected by marks.
He likes chains.
Definite sexual sadist.
He sticks to his type.
16- to 19-year-old girls all blond.
Hangs on to them for a while too.
Look at this. average of 2 years
Between abducting them and killing them.
Low body count long time frame.
This guy's in control of his urges.
Too controlled.
Sadists need new victims new ways to torture.
There are a lot of guys out there who like chains.
Are we sure this is the same unsub?
Kristie Taylor's autopsy report
Also indicates a second connection between these victims.
She was pregnant.
She'd given birth. very soon after the unsub killed her.
How soon after?
Minutes.
This unsub isn't your typical sexual sadist.
Captivity and assault we've seen before.
What we haven't seen is this signature--
The role he forces these women
To fulfill before he kills them.
Motherhood.
Journalist William D. Tammeus wrote
"You don't really understand human nature
"unless you know why a child on a merry-go-round
"will wave at his parents every time around
And why his parents will always wave back."
So why would a sexual sadist make women carry his children?
Gary Heidnik kept a harem in a dungeon.
His goal was to create a large family
As a replacement for his own broken home.
Josef Fritzl kept his daughter
in a cell in his own house
And they had several kids together.
Squalid conditions are part
Of a control fantasy these men had.
If he's keeping these women in a similar location
He'd need a lot of privacy.
He probably built it himself.
Makes him good with his hands.
Why blondes and what significance do they have to him?
Maybe uh the woman who rejected him
Or the woman who wouldn't bear his children?
If that were true he'd be the same age as these girls--
Late teens.
This unsub is too skilled for that.
His own mother then?
She could be a runaway just like these victims.
Which makes his compulsion psych 101--
Killing his mother over and over again for giving birth to him.
Yeah but then why wait until after she gives birth?
Now he has a body and a baby to get rid of.
That troubles me too. we found the mothers but not the infants.
Uh I hate to say this
But what if the women are just a means to an end?
What if the babies are really the ones he's exploiting?
If Kristie Taylor just surfaced
It means he has her baby right now.
JJ check with the parents.
See if there are any similarities in the runaways' patterns
where the unsub's finding them.
Reid and Prentiss go to the latest dump site.
We need to look at victimology.
How he treats these women in the final moments of their lives
Might tell us what he's doing to the children.
Doctor you wrote in your report
That Kristie had several miscarriages.
How was that evident?
There were a number of abrasions in her uterine lining.
Around the third trimester her water would break.
So she never carried to term?
No last time she did.
There was a high level of pitocin in her blood.
It's an artificial hormone. you give it to induce labor.
She was on a tight schedule?
If she lost the baby he would get her pregnant again immediately.
Childbirth is tough enough.
Imagine if your life depends upon it.
All 3 moms had records.
Drug abuse drunk and disorderlies.
But what's more interesting is what he does after he kidnaps them.
This is Kristie Taylor 2 weeks before she was abducted.
He got her healthy.
Well-fed and off the habit.
Not completely.
These drugs in Kristie's system-- what are they?
Tamoxifen metoclopramide
Domperidone progesterone.
Progesterone's a prenatal medication isn't it?
They all are. the first 2 help carry the baby to term.
The last 2 help with lactation.
What kind of sexual sadist
Gives his victims prenatal drugs?
The kind who takes care of the kids he's having.
He gets his rocks off killing the moms
But the babies he protects.
You think he's keeping them?
If he despises the moms
He'd despise their children too.
New Mexico's right on the border.
A lot of human trafficking going on.
This tight schedule he keeps the moms on--
He could be breeding.
Call Child Protection Services.
We need to find out about existing black markets for infants.
Thank you.
There's no tire tracks.
The body wasn't dumped that far from the road.
This guy doesn't care about them
Not enough to even hide them very well.
That's why this doesn't make any sense.
Dump sites reveal something about the unsub you know?
At the very least a geographic familiarity
A place he knows he won't get caught.
Ok so he knows this road.
Yeah except he abducted Kristie in Farmington
And then dumps her here in Rio Rancho.
It's a 175-mile drive.
Why drive that far just to dump a body by the side of the road?
A forensic countermeasure?
covering his tracks by sheer distance?
So the geographical profile won't do us much good.
No it will
Just not with the victims.
We profiled that it's the babies that he's interested in.
That's where he'll reveal himself.
The adoption company he sells through
And whatever network of resources he uses.
He makes shortcuts there for convenience.
No one's gonna drive 100 miles for diapers
Or for a public notary for legal paperwork.
If the babies are in the system they'll lead us to him.
Child trafficking is huge in other countries
新墨西哥州阿布奎基]
But here it's mostly a myth.
Why is that?
There's an easier and legal path--
Adoption.
There'd be a paper trail though wouldn't there?
There are ways to hide your tracks.
There must be a way to identify all these kids.
There's a court record for every adoption.
Give us the records.
We'll start weeding them out by date.
The adoptions in this state are closed.
The files are sealed. so it'll take time.
That's a luxury we don't have.
There's a child at risk right now.
All children who go in and out of the adoption system
Get basic genetic screenings for pre-existing conditions.
We have their DNA.
We can use that. we can match the maternal DNA
With the babies in the system.
We're still talking hundreds of kids.
What if we give you one of the babies' DNA?
That would make it go faster yeah.
He kills these moms so soon after they give birth
Secondary DNA could still be on their bodies.
I'll call the M.E.
I understand. thank you doctor.
Agent Jareau?
I'm Conrad Winmar.
This is my wife Jane.
Thank you for coming in.
Why don't we talk privately?
You--you want to dig up our daughter?
We think the unsub might have left DNA on her.
The last 2 victims didn't have any
But because Monica was the first
He might have made a mistake.
Back when they found her
The detectives said that they did not find his DNA.
It's not his DNA we're looking for.
We suspect your daughter gave birth while she was captive.
What?
The unsub has gotten all of his victims pregnant.
He might be putting the babies
In the adoption system.
The baby's alive?
Possibly.
If we could find placental tissue on Monica
We can test the DNA
Against the state's records.
Give us the release.
The first time I saw her saw her record too.
Thought she was just another girl on the street
Not caring what she did to herself.
I never even thought to look for this.
What is it?
It's a baby's umbilical cord.
The child should be about 4 now.
I hope you find him or her.
I really do.
Thank you.
Ok know this--
Most adoption folk are like the nicest
Most dedicated people in the world.
There are however one or two skeezy ones.
How skeezy?
Super skeezy. I've got a spread sheet from one of them
Expecting compensation for the baby I'm having.
Something you want to tell me Garcia?
Oh that's the sad part my prince.
The genetically perfect offspring
Of Penelope Garcia and Derek Morgan
Wouldn't fetch top dollar.
Who does?
White babies are in higher demand
Than minorities.
Boys are more popular than girls
At least this year anyway.
And then there's the swedish supermodel rule.
The what?
If I were to deliver a blond-haired blue-eyed bundle of joy
I'd be set for life. I would.
Garcia did the baby's DNA
Turn up in new mexico's adoption records?
No. There's no hits on her profile.
And it is a her by the way.
This unsub could still be selling babies
Just not through the system.
That's gonna make him a lot harder to catch.
All right. It's late.
Let's get some rest. We'll hit this fresh in the morning.
Garcia out.
Morgan.
I'd like for you to write up a preliminary profile.
We don't have enough for that.
Well that's why it's preliminary.
A work in progress profile helps show us what we're missing.
Ok.
Sure.
How you holding up?
We just wasted a day looking into a black market
That probably doesn't exist.
That's not what I mean.
I've heard whispers.
You're getting some heat.
I'm taking care of it.
So you uh think we have a tunnel vision problem?
I think we'd like to believe
That we could save those kids
But look what he does to the mothers.
A lot of anger.
He's probably doing the same thing to the children.
His own children.
Maybe.
Garcia said something interesting.
Blond-haired blue-eyed babies get top dollar
In the adoption system.
All the mothers...
Have blond hair and blue eyes.
You're gonna love this.
This guy he has like the best.
Like there is no better.
He has like this access to god.
He doesn't want to hang on to it.
He wants to give it away.
How much further?
Not much.
Because that's what god's love is you know it's sharing.
It's giving everything you have of yourself away
And not expecting anything in return.
Where are we?
Right here baby
Right where we need to be.
She's good right?
That's the kind of chick you want?
She's perfect.
I know it's a long shot
But Monica's parents
Said that she was heading west.
Maybe she made it part of the way when she was kidnapped.
So why not run her DNA against adoption records in surrounding states?
Are you kidding? I think you're brilliant.
Hey jj if we find this little girl
What's gonna happen to her?
If something illegal transpires
During the adoption process the court nullifies it
The child gets returned to the closest blood relative.
If it helps
I have met with the grandparents.
They're wonderful people.
Oh I'm sure they are.
It's just...
I don't know I...
I lost my parents.
Granted I was older than she is but...
What got me through were the people closest to me and...
If Monica's daughter is with a good family
And we take her away from them...
Are we doing more harm than good?
Yeah.
Garcia I don't think we have a choice.
These people have a right to their granddaughter.
You're right.
Yeah.
This sucks.
Yes right away please.
Thank you.
Hey. I just called CPS
Asked them to send over infant mortality files.
Another group for us to eliminate.
Good.
What's that?
Your profile. I disagree with your analysis.
Hotch are you serious?
It's not a law review article
It's just something for us to brainstorm.
But you only focused on one angle Morgan
That the prenatal drugs indicate the presence
Of a wife or a girlfriend. we need more options.
Which I can give you once we make the proper deductions.
Hotch you're asking me to guess.
Morgan in order for the profile to be useful
It has to generate multiple scenarios
About what the unsub is doing.
Rewrite it.
We got her.
Monica Winmar's daughter.
She was adopted 4 years ago.
She's Lisa now.
How did Garcia find her?
She cross-referenced the entire new mexico system.
She wasn't in new mexico. she was in arizona.
So all the mothers were abducted and dumped in new mexico
But he keeps the babies in arizona.
He knows the police will stop looking at the state line.
The adoption agency's gonna be our best lead to the unsub.
Who handled the case?
That's bombshell number 2.
She didn't go through an agency.
She was dropped off anonymously at a church.
Hospitals and churches are safe havens.
You can drop a baby off no questions asked.
Child protection services would look for the closest relative.
Another search that ends at the state line.
And if CPS doesn't find one the baby will go into foster care
Which is what happened to Lisa.
She was lucky. the adoption process
Happened within a month.
So this unsub had the opportunity
To make money off this infant.
He doesn't drops it off at a church
Because he knows the state will take good care of it.
That's awfully considerate.
Outside the murders nothing about this unsub's
Behavior profiles like a sexual sadist...
As I wrote.
Yeah Morgan's right.
It's the actions of a caretaker a mother.
Could our unsub be a woman?
Uh only a man would torture his victims this much.
Men get off on this kind of violence. women don't.
He could be married though his wife being
A passive participant taking care of the moms.
And the babies.
All right. we need to split up.
We'll give the profile to the Arizona
And the New Mexico state police.
Rossi Reid and Prentiss I want you to head to Phoenix.
Morgan you're here with me. we'll finalize the profile.
How are you feeling?
Terrible.
What are you on?
What?
What are you talking about?
When he takes us we're all on something.
I was an alcoholic.
So what are you on?
Uh...crack.
I'm Carol.
I'm Julie.
Here. here's some water. come drink some.
Um...is this some kind of tough love detox?
Oh what is that?
It's like the sun.
It gives us vitamin d.
It keeps us healthy.
Well they can't make us stay here.
Hey! hey let me out!
I want to go home!
I want my clothes! I want my phone!
Let me out of here! let me out!
Why is he doing this?
What does he want?
Your baby.
I'm not pregnant.
You will be.
The unsubs that we are looking for are a couple.
Now the man in the relationship
Most likely has a history of sexual violence.
He started with stalking and then moved his way up to assault and rape.
And that violent streak ended temporarily
When he found his wife.
For the first years of their marriage
She submitted to his torture.
Look for wives who came into the E.R. repeatedly
And with obvious signs of spousal abuse
But you are gonna have to go back about 5 years.
That's because around the time of the first abduction
The visits stopped.
The sexual sadist can't find satisfaction
From a willing participant.
He eventually got to a place where he couldn't escalate
His violence against her without killing her
So she made him a deal.
He gets to kidnap rape and kill
Each of the runaways
And she gets to keep the children.
She's been giving the victims a series of prescription prenatal drugs.
So you're gonna want to look at the obstetric fields uh
Nurses O.B.S.
The wife needs these children.
At first they were the lifeline that kept her alive.
As long as he had other targets for his abuse
She avoided his rage.
So if these children protect her from abuse
Why is she putting them up for adoption?
We believe the unsubs want children
Who resemble them physically
Who no one would question as their own.
All of the runaways have been blond
Which means the unsub may be as well.
But the first child we found in the system was a brunette.
Whatever the physical characteristic--
The color of the eyes the skin type--
If the baby doesn't have it
He or she ends up in the foster care system
Wives of sexual sadists need outlets
As a denial mechanism to cope with what their partners are doing.
And motherhood especially taking care of a helpless infant
Is this woman's way of coping.
You found her?
We have.
How is she?
She's great.
She was adopted by a young couple.
No reports of physical or emotional trauma.
So when can we take her?
Right now we're in touch with her adoptive parents' lawyer
But the law is on your side.
Can we talk to the parents?
We could discuss this with them.
They don't want to initiate contact.
They've been through a lot right now.
They're her parents.
Of course they don't want to give her up.
Well if she wants to see them then we can work that out
But we are her family.
Yes absolutely.
No wait.
What are the risks here?
If we claim her are we hurting her?
It's impossible to tell.
Some kids do great.
Others have trouble.
But why are we talking about risks?
She's Monica's daughter.
Conrad...
She's not their blood.
Stop it.
Thank you Agent Jareau.
But my husband and I we need to discuss this.
What's this?
It's the pattern I've been looking for.
The unsubs hid their tracks with the mothers
But they weren't so careful with the abandoned babies.
Did you find more children?
DNA-wise no but deductively yes.
I gathered all the records for all infants who entered into foster care
In a 2-week window following each mother's death.
Then I narrowed it down to babies that were abandoned at churches.
This is where the guesswork begins.
Monica Winmar's daughter was abandoned at a presbyterian church.
Let's assume the unsub or the wife at least is presbyterian.
That means all other unwanted children
Are gonna be left at the same denomination right?
That narrows it down to 3 babies
Left at 3 different presbyterian churches
All within this 20-mile radius.
This is where they live.
These kids you deduced to--
Have you looked at their files?
No. Right now I've only been tracking churches. Why?
Because you just uncovered another pattern.
Yeah we're packing up now.
We can be in Phoenix in about 2 hours.
You sure about this?
The names of the babies Reid found tells us everything.
Lisa Elizabeth Amanda.
We profiled there'd be a type they'd keep
And a type they'd put into foster care.
They're keeping the boys.
It's time.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
Hey where are you going? Come back!
You have to come back! Please!
They never stay for this part.
No no no no. You're not actually--
Yes...I am.
They've induced.
What am I supposed to do?
You help me.
1-1.000...
2-1.000...
No no no I'm sorry I can't.
3-1.000...
I can't help you.
I can't. I'm sick.
I'm not well. I need a...
I can't do it.
Julie listen to me.
Are you listening to me?
Yes. Yes.
If this baby doesn't make it...
They are going to kill me.
And once they've killed me
They are going to move on to you.
Do you understand?
Ok.
Ok. What do we do?
JJ I need you to call these fertility specialists
And get them over here for interviews.
Whoa.
Yeah I know.
Hotch wants to focus on the prenatal drugs
The unsubs are giving the victims.
He thinks we can build a new suspect pool
And he wants it done yesterday.
There's 2 pages of names here. Shouldn't we narrow it down?
JJ just do it ok?
I'm sorry.
Is everything ok?
Hotch has been on me ever since we got here
And for the life of me I can't figure out why.
Oh I might know.
The night before Hotch picked this case
Chief Strauss stopped by the b.a.u.
They were behind closed doors
And it seemed like it got a little tense.
Well the bureau's been on him for a while.
He must have known this was gonna happen.
Except now they're making him
Justify every decision.
For Hotch that's...hell.
Dr. Dekeyser we don't think
She's getting these prenatal drugs as a patient.
You're thinking she's writing the scrip for these herself.
Something like that.
Then she wouldn't be very knowledgeable
About what she's doing.
Some of these drugs have serious side effects.
There's dozens of meds
I would prescribe before these
All of them more effective.
So why would she use these?
My guess--these are the ones she had access to.
Fertility drugs are a cocktail
And you keep remixing the cocktail until you get pregnant.
The information is out there on the internet.
She found the right one.
So the woman was prescribed these drugs
Maybe for some other illness
And figured out that they helped carry a baby to term.
Exactly.
Then the real question is
What other diseases do these drugs treat?
Ok. I can do this.
I can do this.
What?
Nothing. you remind me of me.
Carol?
Carol please please stay awake.
Please?
Ok just--just focus
On the sound of my voice ok?
Can you do that?
I'm here.
Carol tell me about the woman
Who was here before me.
What happened to her?
She miscarried...
A lot.
Then she gave birth to a girl.
They don't like girls.
This isn't your first time is it?
No.
What happened?
He didn't make it.
I'm sorry.
They let you live
Even if you lose him.
They want those boys.
Ok. ok hey. hey.
Listen I don't know what to do ok
So please please just tell me what to do.
How dilated am I?
Wh-what? I don't know what that means.
Just put your fingers in a row and...
Measure me.
Wait...
Oh my god.
Ok...
Oh my god.
Ok. um...
It's 4. it's 4 fingers.
And i--oh god is that the head?
Oh my god what does that mean?
It means...
It's time to push.
What is this?
It's a tactical arrest plan.
I'd like you to write it up for this case.
You want me to write up how we apprehend these unsubs
Without risking the lives of the children.
Yes.
Hotch I've led dozens of tactical assaults.
You've never made me write up one of these before.
That's because I always do it for you after each case.
You know what?
I'm sorry Strauss is coming down on you.
This is not about Strauss.
Really? I disagree.
Look I understand that you're under the gun.
But I gotta say it. I'm really not all that surprised.
I've watched you walk away from
A bunch of cops gunning down unsubs in d.c.
You walked in unprotected to a hostage situation in louisville.
Of course the bureau's worried about you.
Man I'm worried about you.
But just because you're the one who's under the magnifying glass
That doesn't mean I can't do my job.
Morgan there's a big part of your job
That I do for you
Because I don't need you worried about paperwork and politics.
I need you in the field and focused and catching the next unsub.
But I can't do that anymore.
I don't have to justify my orders to you
And you do have to follow them.
I've always followed your orders when they made sense.
Well if you have a problem with this one
Tell me now.
You're the boss.
Garcia needs to talk to us asap.
Ok so the gold star of the day goes to agent David Rossi
And his short list of one disease
These prenatal drugs also treat.
Breast cancer. Progesterone tamoxifen slow the spread
Metoclopramide and domperidone...
Are for anti-nausea if I remember correctly.
If this woman has breast cancer
Would she be able to get pregnant?
She could. She'd have to be dedicated.
How dedicated?
Well she'd have to go off chemotherapy.
She'd be in a lot of pain.
But she'll try anyway.
Her whole life is children. That's her goal.
The first runaway Monica Winmar
When was she abducted?
5 years ago.
How many breast cancer patients in Arizona
Got pregnant 5 to 6 years ago?
Uh let me see.
Not a lot. 7.
How many of those patients are married to a man
With a history of sexual violence?
Just one... Robert and Linda Reimann.
Oh jeez.
What?
She lost the baby in month 8.
She had to go through labor anyway.
Well that kind of physical and emotional trauma
There's our stressor.
Garcia was the baby a boy?
Yeah. They even named him--Michael.
There has to be a name on the death certificate.
Doctors encourage bonding between mothers and stillborns.
I...volunteer with a new mom counseling group.
They say it helps them cope with feelings of loss.
Well this unsub can't cope
So she's recreating them.
Ok come on you're almost there. Just push.
Push!
Oh my god.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Ha! It's a boy.
You're here.
You made it.
No.
Don't.
No! No please leave her alone. Please!
Please please please just wait one minute.
Please please!
It's a boy.
Michael.
Ok commander this here
Is the unsub's address.
Now 5 years ago when the wife lost their child
The husband started paying
For home renovations with his credit card.
Shower toilet tile and mesh fencing
Which he did not put up in his backyard.
He was building his dungeon.
No permits were filed for additional building on the property
So the entrance must be inside the house.
How many doors are there to cover?
There's 2--one in the front one in the back.
We have the arrest warrants?
Faxed over 20 minutes ago.
Morgan what's your plan?
I think we should do a soft entry.
See if we can get the kids out
Before the parents even know what's happening.
You'd be in the door first?
Do you have another idea?
Send Prentiss and jj in first.
Children are more likely to trust a woman and we need that presence.
We don't know how many kids are in the house.
I mean the parents could take a hostage.
But if we go in hot
That would definitely happen.
Hotch is right.
This is the way.
Hi.
It's ok.
It's ok. we're the police.
We're the good guys.
Can you come outside with me?
Ok. ok.
Hotch we've got one boy accounted for.
He's on his way out to you
But there could still be more in the basement.
FBI.
Where's your wife?
In the nursery.
Rossi.
Hotch.
Go.
I knew this would end.
I always knew you'd come to our door
And take this away.
Ma'am why don't you give me the baby.
We can talk about it.
Why would I want to do that?
What you've been doing is wrong.
You must know that.
Oh god please please get us out of here!
Oh! Oh thank god. Thank god.
We're all clear here.
It's ok. It's ok you're safe. Come with me.
But no I can't leave her.
All secure but we need medical.
This is all I have left.
Do you understand?
My husband hates me.
There's nobody here that can help me with him
With this with any of it.
He's all I have.
Linda.
Please.
I need you to think about the baby right now.
You're suffering from stage 4 breast cancer.
You've given your medication to the women
That have been locked up downstairs.
You don't have a lot of time left.
I know you want somebody who will always remember you don't you?
The baby's name is Michael right?
Yeah.
Michael will remember you.
He's gonna know that you helped bring him into the world.
That's a part of him now.
And he will always ask about you
Long after you're gone.
Do you really believe that?
I do.
I would have been a wonderful mother.
Then prove it.
Let him go.
Where's my son?
We're looking for him.
Please don't let anything happen to him.
Look he's here.
He's fine.
He's ok.
You are beautiful aren't you?
I spoke with Lisa's adoptive parents.
They've agreed to talk to you.
They're not willing to give up custody
But they do want Lisa to know her grandparents.
Yeah we-- we can live with that.
The reason why I wanted you to come by
Was...a year before giving birth to Lisa
Monica had a son.
We've already matched his DNA to your daughter.
The closest relative should take custody.
Would you like to meet him?
What's his name?
Michael.
Michael.
Have a seat.
The bureau thinks that my ability
To lead this team has been compromised.
What do you think?
Sometimes I question you Hotch.
But at the end of the day I do respect you.
You're the leader of this team
And my job is to have your back.
Well that's not important to the bureau.
They've been questioning me since Foyet's attack.
And they're not entirely wrong.
I've tried to do my best
But what matters now is if Strauss replaces me
This whole unit will come under scrutiny.
Members will be reassigned budgets will be cut.
Come on Hotch nobody's gonna replace you.
Fight Strauss. I'll go to the mat for you.
So will everybody else. You know that.
Morgan it won't work.
Decisions like this have their own momentum...
Unless I step down.
Step down? What are you talking about?
I'm resigning as unit chief at the end of the week.
What?
No!
Hotch look yeah ok
Sometimes your actions I may disagree with them
But it's not enough for you to leave this team.
I'm not leaving the team
I'm just no longer in charge.
You are.
Me?
Look I had the chance to be unit chief in New York
And I said no.
I turned it down because I like this team.
Strauss can't just fire you like this.
She can reassign me.
And we can avoid that if I promote internally.
This is wrong.
It's the only way to keep the team together.
So all of this--
This is why you've been pushing me so hard huh?
I haven't been pushing you that hard.
Morgan I need to know
Right now--
Will you do this?
This would be temporary.
Once we catch Foyet
All this goes back to normal.
Let's get started.
What's all this?
This is the job
Unless you have other plans.
