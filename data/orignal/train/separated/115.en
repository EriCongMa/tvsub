第六季 第十四集
Son of a bitch!
We're being evicted.
How is that even possible?
"If the leaseholder is unable "to be physically on the premises,
"said obligation may be fulfilled by his or her proxy."
Say hello to his or her proxy.
We can't coordinate,
but you can get to me through my associate.
About what?
Your PAC.
The PAC that I set up in support of you.
Cough suppressant, nasal spray,
decongestant, vitamin C.
If you don't like cherry flavor, there's orange.
Let's see.
Here. Oh, no, wait, that's tropical.
I'll go back and get orange.
I don't have a cold. You know that.
Yeah, but it's prophylactic.
Okay, how we doing?
Let's hear the voice.
I'm Alicia Florrick,
and I'd like your endorsement.
It's not that bad.
It's kind of cute, actually.
I called them.
They still want to do the interview today.
Good. I'm fine.
Okay, I'll be back to pick you up in three hours
and take you over there. Rest your voice.
Is, um, Prady's interview online?
Yes, and don't worry about it.
Which means I should worry about it.
No. Stop talking.
Just listen.
Do you want me to make you some tea?
I'll make you some tea.
No, no, I'm fine. Guys.
I just have been giving too many speeches.
Look, we're entering the home stretch.
We're a week away from election day,
and you and Prady are neck and neck.
So this interview today, it's everything.
You have a great bedside manner.
"Don't worry about it, but if you screw this up, everyone will die."
If you get the editorial board's endorsement,
traditionally speaking, that's two points in the polls.
Now, you need it and he needs it.
So whoever gets it wins,
you understand? Don't talk.
She understands.
Here's the thing. It's a conservative paper.
It's an old democratic machine.
That works in your favor. They like Peter.
So sell them on the whole stand-by-your-man stuff
and be tough on crime.
Are they gonna ask about Zach?
About the abortion?
They might. If they do,
just give them the angry mom thing.
My angry mom thing?
Don't talk.
Just nod.
We're leaving now.
Rest your voice, don't take any calls.
Matter of fact, let me take that.
I'm fine.
No, you're not. I'm turning it off.
Rest your voice. Stay here for the next three hours.
Don't think about anything else. I will be back to pick you up.
Marissa, it's time to leave.
Call me if you need anything. You'll be great.
And don't take the nighttime stuff
before the interview or you'll be loopy.
I don't have a cold.
We're going now.
Thank you for doing this, Mr. Prady.
Thank you for having me.
I-I, it's a, it's good to finally get down
to the substance of this campaign.
Actually, who had a lot to do with my thinking about the,
uh, the S.A. Office was Alicia Florrick.
That you'll have to explain.
My campaign manager is not gonna be happy.
Uh, I'm supposed to say "Opponent,"
not her name, but, uh,
somehow I think you won't be tricked by that.
We might be.
Well, Alicia thinks the problems
with the state's attorney's office are small.
Better management, more expertise.
I believe they are large issues.
A racist infrastructure,
a militari...
Frank Prady said
you believe the issues in the S.A.'s office
are small and manageable. Is that true?
Well, even manageable issues aren't small.
They do need to be managed.
And the good thing about manageable issues
is that I can be held accountable.
If I don't bring in more hate crime prosecutions
in my first hundred days,
fire me.
What does that even mean, "Fire you"?
How can they fire you? You're already in office.
It's not about practicality, it's about sounding good.
I know it makes good copy if I criticize my opponent,
but I won't do it.
Okay. How about her husband?
How much time do we have?
No, no, no.
You're not as funny or as likable as Mr. Prady,
Are you, Mrs. Florrick?
Well, I think I'm likable.
But more importantly, I'm passionate.
That makes it sound like you're acknowledging you're not likable.
No, she's trying to turn a negative into a positive.
Are you acknowledging you're not funny or likable?
No, I'm just saying that likability
is not a key component to the job.
Frank Prady has been a reporter for the last five...
We said we wouldn't smear each other.
Likability is not a key component to the job.
I've spent the last five years working full-time as a lawyer.
I haven't had time to finesse my onscreen presence.
Good, elegant.
Don't forget,
it's a conservative newspaper.
So, let's turn to your home life.
How about your son, Zach?
Did he get an abortion with his 15-year-old girlfriend?
Why do you still freeze up at that?
It's a question you'll be asked.
She's not still freezing up at it.
This is the first time she's been asked it.
It's not even the first time she's been asked it,
because we're just in her imagination thinking about...
I'm fine, Mom.
You don't have to worry about me.
Hello, Mr. Canning.
Alicia?
You okay? You sound sick.
No, I'm just resting my voice.
Okay, good.
Well, I'll do all the talking.
I-I want to settle this lawsuit between us.
I-I'm not well,
and-and I don't want to leave this earth
with this hanging over our heads.
Mr. Canning, you've been leaving this earth
for three months now.
So excuse my incredulity.
I'm suing your firm for wrongful eviction.
It's a $12 million suit,
but for old times' sake, Alicia,
I'm willing to settle for $4 million.
Really? So that'll only cost me
$500,000 out of pocket?
Well, it's better than $2 million out of pocket.
It's a nuisance suit, Mr. Canning.
You were evicted; get over it.
I was wrongfully evicted,
and I just don't think you want to be in depositions
during your last week of the campaign.
You won't look good being deposed
by a deathly ill man.
You're amazing, Mr. Canning.
You're supposedly in the last few weeks of your life,
and you would rather be battling me
than home with your family.
I can do both.
Call me by 6:00 p.m. today with your counteroffer,
or I'll see you in depositions tomorrow.
Depositions that won't look good in the press.
You don't have a case, Mr. Canning.
Come on, Alicia.
You're a chess player.
Think it through.
This one I'll win.
This office was mine to sublet to whomever I wanted.
I chose to evict Mr. Canning and his firm
so that I could occupy it myself.
Diane was no longer a tenant in the building.
It was illegal for her to evict our firm.
It's true I wasn't a tenant,
but my proxy was.
Howard Lyman had office space.
Yes, but Howard Lyman was hired for fraudulent reasons
explicitly to-to evict me.
And that's a wrongful eviction.
Howard Lyman was not Diane's proxy
because at the time of the eviction,
she had no signed agreement with him.
October 18.
That was the day Howard signed his partnership agreement.
Two weeks after I was evicted.
Howard could not have been Diane's proxy
because at the time, he was still a partner of mine.
霍华德·莱曼不是合伙人
Good morning, everyone.
How are we doing?
Ooh, bagels.
I didn't need a written contract.
I had an oral agreement with Diane.
That's how I became her proxy.
Queen takes your bishop, Mr. Canning.
Not really.
但是我们有霍华德
What were the particulars
of your oral agreement, Mr. Lyman?
Um... what?
What were the particulars of your oral agreement
with Diane Lockhart?
You know, that I become a partner.
You understand
that an oral agreement isn't valid
unless both parties understand the terms.
So, did you understand the terms?
Sure.
And what were they?
Rook to queen four.
Hi, I'm David Lee, family law.
You used to work as Mr. Canning's partner,
didn't you, Mr. Lee?
Yes. Hello, Mr. Canning.
Hi.
And now,
you work for Florrick, Agos & Lockhart.
Yes.
And once Mr. Lyman came to you and Canning
and told you he was leaving,
did you try to outbid for his services?
We did.
In other words,
you understood his oral agreement to be genuine.
We did.
That's all we need.
Howard doesn't need to understand the particulars
of his contract.
You did.
Mr. Canning, hello.
I have an answer for you now
on your suit, if you want.
Well, now you're sounding confident, Alicia.
You were right to tell me to game it through.
Because...
Yes?
I'm gonna call you back.
Uh, Mr. Canning.
I have to deal with something here.
Oh, absolutely. Take your time, Alicia.
I-I want you to be perfectly comfortable
with your decision.
Hello?
Yeah. I think we have a problem
with our wrongful eviction suit.
Yeah, what's that?
Are all the partners on the hook
if we pay Canning?
Yeah.
Even David Lee?
No.
He joined the partnership afterwards.
You think there's a problem there?
Yes.
Can you find out if David Lee
has been in touch with Canning?
Sure.
Are you okay? You sound like you have a cold.
It's just laryngitis.
Oh, that's my call waiting.
Can you get back to me in the next hour or so?
Sure.
Hello.
It's me. W-Why is your phone on?
Why are you calling me?
Uh... we have a problem.
Uh, there's this blog called Court Scene.
And they're reporting something
that may end up in your interview.
And you need to answer it.
About Zach?
No. About Bishop.
Apparently there's a wiretap
where he's supposedly saying,
"Don't worry about getting arrested.
I just bought the next state's attorney."
Did you hear what I said?
I did.
Alicia, this is... devastating.
You said "Supposedly saying" there was a wiretap.
Was there or not?
Well, it doesn't matter if it's real; the rumor is the reality.
You need to respond.
How can I answer if I don't know
if it's true or not?
I'll work up a response.
You just turn your phone off and focus, okay?
Yeah, this is really helping.
Mrs. Florrick
Are you in league with Lemond Bishop,
the top drug dealer in town?
Damn.
Don't worry about an arrest.
I just bought the next state's attorney.
Don't worry about an arrest.
I just bought the next state's attorney.
Although I guess she won't be in office for six months.
Don't worry about an arrest.
I just bought the next state's attorney.
Although I guess she won't be in office for six months.
You know what?
She might lose to her opponent.
You want me to respond to a rumor of a wiretap?
Yes.
It doesn't even make sense.
I'm neck and neck with Prady.
Even if I do win,
I won't take office for another six months.
You're acknowledging the premise of the question!
Only because it's a stupid question.
No, it's not. It's a likely question.
Hello.
You're right. There are 22 calls
between David Lee and Canning over the last week.
That's why Canning is so confident.
He's got David Lee on his side.
Yeah, look. I have Diane and Cary here, hold on.
So, you think David Lee's gonna testify against us?
I think Canning's counting on it.
That's how he'll win his wrongful eviction.
Do you have a cold, Alicia?
No, just laryngitis.
Even if he wins on wrongful eviction,
all he should get is what he's out on rent for the week.
Right, that can't be more than $30,000.
We undercut him on damages.
Canning called me with an offer of $4 million.
Why did he call you?
I don't know.
Maybe he thought I would want to settle.
Because of your campaign?
Yes.
Are you wanting to settle?
No. Not at $4 million.
Good, so we use the depositions to undercut the damages.
Are you coming in later?
No. I-I have an interview. I'll be in tomorrow.
Okay, rest your voice, Alicia.
What do you want me to do?
Divest yourself of the PAC.
Why?
Because it's hurting me.
No. What's hurting you
is you being here in my kitchen.
What do you want me to do?
Divest yourself of Alicia's PAC.
Why?
Because it's hurting her.
It's going to hurt her twice as much
if I pull my money now.
It'll look like a reaction to these rumors.
You want Alicia to win, right? You want...
Kalinda.
I've been thinking about you.
And I've been thinking about you.
We don't talk this way, and you know it.
$4 million is not punitive.
It's actual.
You're telling us you have $12 million
in actual damages from your eviction?
Yes. I lost my top client.
That's $12 million in annual earnings.
You didn't lose your client because we evicted you.
We were in the middle of a crucial settlement conference
and we had nowhere to meet.
Oh, come on.
Come on what?
If you want me to do something,
I could put in a statement
supporting Frank Prady.
Excuse me?
I could put out a statement
in support of Frank Prady.
What would that do?
I didn't say on the wiretap
which state's attorney I had bought.
You want to imply it's Frank Prady?
No. I just want to muddy the waters.
I had a top client who fired us
the week of our eviction.
A top client who'd been with me for years.
Which client is that?
Solis Securities.
We can't be held
responsible for the whims of a client.
This is an affidavit from the CEO of Solis
claiming it was our delay in handling the settlement conference
that led to our ouster.
Mr. Canning, you said you lost
your top client Solis Securities due to your eviction?
That's correct.
Solis Securities left you and joined which firm?
Brooks, Spelling & Myers.
A firm of equal size, equal equity
and also one without an office space.
What?
Yes.
They were going through a move of their own
at the same time as yours.
So, why would Solis Securities leave you
and join another firm that was homeless?
I don't know. Why would they leave?
Why would a firm that's been with me for a decade
just suddenly turn around and leave?
I like to take a nap at lunchtime.
But my pants, they get, you know,
so sweaty, so, uh, I remove them.
Uh, just at lunchtime.
You're kidding.
And the CEO of Solis
happened upon you over lunch.
Yeah, but... I explained.
Think he understood.
And one week later,
Solis Securities decided to leave the firm.
So, again
you have nothing to do with Lemond Bishop?
That's correct.
Ever since we fired him as a client.
Okay, moving on.
Well, you can't just leave it like that.
She's a crafty one.
You have to ask her a question with no out.
And what might that be?
To your knowledge, Mrs. Florrick,
has Lemond Bishop,
the top drug dealer in Chicago,
ever contributed any money to your campaign
or PAC supporting your campaign?
First of all, I have no coordination...
That's not the question.
It's a yes or no answer.
To your knowledge,
has Lemond Bishop contributed
to your campaign or PAC?
No.
You can't tell them you're knowingly taking money
from the top drug dealer in town.
But I am knowingly taking money
from the top drug dealer in town.
No, you're not.
I am. He told me.
Maybe they won't ask the question.
Where is this rumor even coming from anyway?
Some stupid little web site.
What was it called?
What do you want in a credit card?
No rotating categories?
No signups to earn cash rewards?
Earning unlimited 1.5% cash back
on every purchase every day?
返现1.5%
Zero percent intro APR on purchases
until September of 2015?
You've got it.
What do you want in a credit card?
Everything.
What do you want in a credit card?
Will?
I'm not here.
It sounds like you.
Marissa, have you been out here the whole time?
It hasn't been the whole time. Just half an hour.
In case you needed anything.
Where you going? Out.
I need some fresh air.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I need to focus. I can't focus in there.
I'll come with you.
No, no. I-I'll be okay.
I just need ten minutes of fresh air.
It's cold out there.
I'll be okay.
Are you really okay?
Yeah.
I don't know. I think.
I'll-I'll see you.
Damn it.
Hi, Jon.
You're out walking, Alicia.
Marissa said you're out walking.
I just need to clear my head.
You're getting worked up about the interview.
It's gonna be fine.
No, it isn't.
I did know Bishop put money in my PAC.
Look, here's the thing
this might not even come up in the interview.
They're gonna ask me a question
I can't answer "No" to.
And what is that?
To my knowledge,
did Bishop give money to me or my PAC?
Watch where you're going!
Oh, my God.
What? And why can't you answer no?
Jon... it's true.
Bishop told me directly he was giving money to my PAC.
He was forming my PAC.
But you don't know that he did it.
Jon...!
You're a lawyer. Answer to what you know, right?
You don't actually know that Bishop gave money to your PAC.
You just know that he said he would.
In fact, you can't know
that Bishop gave money to your PAC,
because that would be coordinating with your PAC,
and coordinating with your PAC is against the law.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me? What?
You said, "Oh, my God."
No... no, I just, um...
I just had a thought.
Alicia, remember what I told you?
No.
Questions are for dopes.
Oh. Right.
This is one of those questions.
It's not being sophist to answer it with some...
specificity.
Okay. Let me think on it.
Good. Go home, clear your head,
don't think about anything else.
See you in two hours.
Okay. Bye.
Why is it all right for you but not for me?
Will?
Alicia.
I've missed you.
I miss you, Will.
I know.
I've been away.
Just for a little while.
But I'm back.
Oh, God...
I don't know what I'm doing.
Everything's falling apart.
You're strong.
You'll hold it together.
You've never... talked like that before.
I know.
You're not really here, are you?
主爱你 不要放弃他
不是放弃 是不信了
不是放弃 是不信了
不是放弃 是不信了
Hello.
Hi, Grace, it's Mom.
Mom, where are you?
All your stuff's on the table.
I know, I just had to get out for a minute.
Um, I think I'm getting your texts.
Yeah, that happens when Zach updates the software.
We share an account.
What text did you get?
Something from Evan.
Yeah?
Just ignore that.
Okay.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What about with you? You sound terrible.
No, I just have laryngitis.
Okay.
I'll see you when you get back.
Solis Securities fired me
because my health is in decline
and, therefore, my work was not at its best.
And my inadequate performance came about
because I spent two furious weeks looking for office space.
My health was negatively impacted
by the fact that you all threw me out in the street--
a-a-a man dying of liver disease.
Your liver failure seems to come and go whenever you need it to.
Is that a question?
Yes, actually, it is.
I'm appalled at you, Mrs. Florrick--
questioning my health.
Especially with you running for office.
You're being deposed. You're under oath.
So...
let's take this seriously.
Is your liver failing?
It's my kidney, and, yes, it's failing.
The last time I saw you, you had a kidney transplant.
What happened?
It failed.
And how long did the doctors say you had to live?
Two months, if I'm lucky.
More, if I can find another kidney.
So why are you here, spending your time, suing us?
The same reason you're fighting with me.
I mean, it's what we do.
I don't believe you.
Obviously, because you'd have more compassion, if you did.
You use compassion like it's a currency, Mr. Canning.
Don't attack me like this!
I'm not attacking you!
This isn't gonna look good.
It's not me! It's the music!
Why are you still angry at me?
You know you'll have to pay me off.
Would it make you happy if I do?
Yes, it will.
Why?
You'll have lost something and I'll have won.
And that's the whole point?
Yes.
What did you think it was?
I don't know.
I thought I did.
That's your phone.
Oh, hi, Alicia. It's Cary and Diane.
Hi.
I've given it a lot of thought.
I think we need to pay Canning.
Not all of it, but some of it,
because he could use his illness to hurt us.
Yeah, we thought the same thing, but...
then something happened here.
Canning canceled the depositions for tomorrow.
Why? He wants to stall.
No, he's in the hospital.
What?!
I just talked to him an hour ago!
Yeah. It just happened.
What happened?
All we know is that he fainted.
But I think you would agree we should hold off
on any negotiations or offer,
even if out of respect.
What hospital is he at?
His wife was calling from Harbor,
but I don't think he's up for negotiations.
Sounds pretty serious.
I-I-I'll call you back.
What difference does it make?
I'm probably in a coma or something.
You'd do it for me.
What? Come to your hospital?
You're kidding, right?
If I was dying?
No.
I don't believe you.
I'm more consistent than you, Alicia.
Your husband is sleeping now, Mrs. Canning.
It's a touch-and-go situation,
but we'll be monitoring...
To your knowledge, Mrs. Florrick,
has Lemond Bishop contributed money to your campaign
or PACs supporting your campaign?
No.
You're sure?
Yes. Not to my knowledge.
主爱你 不要放弃他
不是放弃 是不信了
Why are you done?
Why shouldn't I be done?
Well, I don't know.
I... I thought it mattered to you.
It did matter to me.
Now it doesn't.
That happens. I thought you'd be happy.
It's good news.
She's stopped believing in fairy tales.
I know.
So what's the problem?
I don't know.
Maybe there is no problem.
The problem isn't language.
People rejoice when somebody finds Jesus,
even though it's false.
But we lack language for rejoicing
when someone finds the truth.
Who are you again?
Richard Dawkins.
Renowned atheist
and the best-selling author of 'The God Delusion'?
The same.
Hey, Mom.
What are you doing?
Sniffing glue.
I felt a kick.
See, that's offensive.
There's no reason Grace suddenly becomes pregnant
and starts sniffing glue.
I'm not saying it's due to loss of religion.
Yes, you are.
But an atheist can act just as ethically as a Christian,
maybe even more so. We deal in the truth.
Look at all those priests who raped small boys.
I'm not saying Christianity makes them do that,
but it certainly doesn't seem to stop them.
There is no ethical standard without the absolute of God.
Everything else slides without it.
That is just not true.
We can choose to live by the Golden Rule.
It honors men and women more if they choose to do right.
And not worry about some Santa Claus-like figure
who punishes and rewards based on us doing right.
Yeah, but what about Zach?
Do you really want Grace to turn out like Zach?
Why am I being used as an example of what not to do?
I'm at Georgetown.
Daddy's sleeping right now,
but he's okay.
We'll see him tomorrow.
Daddy loves you both.
So what is this? An intervention?
No, I just wanted you to be able to discuss it with someone.
Why not you?
Why not what me?
Why can't I discuss it with you?
Because I don't believe in what you do.
I know, so why can't I be more like you?
Uh, you don't want to be like your mom.
Wait, why not?
Because of your interview.
You're planning to lie.
It's not lying.
Why isn't it lying?
Because I can't answer the question
without coordinating with my PAC.
And the other thing... that Jon said.
Uh, you mean the Jon you're planning to sleep with.
No.
Yes.
But why is that bad?
Because you're married.
Peter and I have an agreement.
You know, I am really sick of you guys
playing into this "Good girl" Thing.
Making me feel guilty.
He slept with Kalinda.
He slept with Ramona.
He screwed hookers.
Then tell the truth.
I am.
No, at your interview.
If I do that, I won't get elected.
How do you know that?
To your knowledge, Mrs. Florrick,
has Lemond Bishop contributed money to your campaign
or PACs supporting your campaign?
Yes.
Yes, he did?
The top drug dealer in town did?
Yes, I had no control of what he did.
Bishop told me that he was financing my PAC.
We're very impressed, Mrs. Florrick.
We're used to the canned answers of politicians,
the casual lies,
but you've been very brave in here today by telling the truth.
So we're gonna give you our endorsement.
Really?
That was very brave of you, Mom.
One doesn't need God to act ethically.
Well, enjoy your hug.
'Cause that's not really how it's gonna go, and you know it.
Uh-oh.
What?
Buzzfeed --
"Is Alicia Florrick in league with a drug dealer?"
There's one on Politico, too.
"Does Florrick have a secret agreement with Lemond Bishop
to go lightly on drug arrests?"
Alicia, hello.
Mrs. Canning, I'm so sorry.
Simone.
Simone.
I'm so sorry. How is he?
He's, uh, not good.
They don't think he's gonna make it through the night.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
I spoke to him earlier today--
he sounded so strong.
Yeah, I know, he wanted to go to work.
Thank you for coming.
You know, he has all these other lawyer friends,
and not a single one came today.
I'm sorry.
Do you want to see him?
Do I...?
Is he conscious?
No.
No, but it'll make a difference.
He wanted me to go see you if anything went wrong.
He asked me to visit you.
That's Louis.
Always caring for other people.
Yes.
He just looks so weak.
Thank you.
I'm gonna let you go, okay?
Is there anything I can do?
Anything -- food or anything.
You can pray for him.
Pray for him?
Pray he lives through the night.
Hypocrite.
Okay.
Grace, hi.
How are you?
Good. What's wrong?
Nothing, um...
I'm coming home in a minute.
Can you just tell Mr. Elfman if he gets there
that I'll be home soon?
Okay.
And, um...
one more thing.
What?
Can I ask you to pray for me?
What?
Why?
There's a friend in the hospital.
He asked me to pray for him, but I just... I-I can't.
Why not?
Because I-I don't believe in it.
The way you do.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
How's your voice?
Good.
Yeah, it sounds good.
Good thing you went out.
I just made you some tea with lemon.
Your mom's getting ready.
I'm not trying to replace you.
What?
I just said that, you know, in case you were worried.
You look pretty.
Thanks.
Was it wrong to ask you to pray?
No, but you can, too.
But it wouldn't mean anything.
It wouldn't mean anything coming from me, either, would it?
I promised someone I'd pray for them,
and then I realized it would be hypocritical coming from me
but not from you.
Why did you promise?
Politeness?
Are you losing your faith, Grace?
No.
I don't know.
I just...
It comes and goes.
I hope I don't influence you not to believe.
I don't want that.
I'm glad you found something.
Even if it's something that you don't believe?
Yes.
Good luck on your interview.
Do you know what you're gonna say?
I think I do.
I love you.
That's Mr. Elfman.
Time to go.
I'll be right there.
I'm sorry.
Are you?
Yes.
You've reached Zach's voice mail.
I'm in class right now or sleeping it off-- leave a...
Hello?
It doesn't make any sense to tell them
what you know about Bishop.
Even if it's the truth?
Well, here's the thing--
the truth isn't "This happened" or "That happened,"
the truth to me is about doing good.
And the only way to put yourself in a position to do good
is by getting elected.
That's the greater truth.
And if you don't get elected,
somebody else is gonna take that position,
and they're gonna do bad things with it.
How do you know that I can do better things than Prady?
Because I... have talked with you.
And been with you.
And I believe in you.
No, truth is just truth.
Telling the truth, being truthful--
sometimes words have to mean what they say,
or-or else they'll just mean whatever you want.
If I tell you I won't steal your car,
but then I steal your car
because I define "Steal" in a different way than you do,
then how can we all be civilized together?
But we're not voting for a saint.
We're voting for a prosecutor.
Thank you, St. Alicia.
Telling the truth is...
it seems like the bare minimum for both jobs.
Would you lie if you were state's attorney?
No, I wouldn't.
Then I don't think you should win.
Good-bye, Will.
So don't say anything about Bishop, okay?
You can't coordinate with the PAC.
That way you had no knowledge
of who's contributed to it and who hasn't.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
I'll be out here.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Your voice sounds better.
I'm finding it.
Mrs. Florrick, hello.
We're ready for you.
I'm ready, too.
Nice to meet you.
