hey . we &apos;re about to buy tickets for comic @-@ con.

but as long as one of us gets in , we can buy passes ...
good lord , this is not the time for flirting !

refresh ... refresh ...
refresh . refresh .
refresh .
refresh . it &apos;s been ten minutes !
we &apos;re running out of time .
to be cool ? yeah .
i did it ! i did it ! i &apos;m in the queue !
and they say firefighters are the real heroes .
uh , what number in line are you ?
uh , 15 ...
great !
... thousand , 211 .
damn !
oh , they only have thursday and sunday passes left .
really ?
oh , thursday &apos;s gone . just sunday left .
oh , sunday &apos;s the worst . everybody &apos;s leaving ,
most of good panels are over ,
the only t @-@ shirts left are small and xxxxl
sunday &apos;s gone .
not sunday ! i love sunday !
so that &apos;s it ? everything &apos;s sold out ?
yeah .
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re not going .
it &apos;s okay .
you know , there @-@ there &apos;s always wondercon in anaheim .
that @-@ that &apos;s just as good .
excuse me .
oh , guys , this is really sad .
and in a different way than it was 20 minutes ago .
i can &apos;t believe we wasted all that time on our hulk costumes .
you were all going as the hulk ?
not the same hulk .
ferrigno , bana , norton and ruffalo .
we would have been the angry green belles
of the masquerade ball .
yeah .
and we &apos;re back to the first kind of sad .
gentlemen , i have the solution to our comic @-@ con problem .
we don &apos;t need them .
i &apos;m starting my own convention .
sheldon , just buy scalped tickets with us .
i told you . buying scalped tickets is against the rules .
if you get caught , you get banned from comic @-@ con for life .
life , leonard .
you &apos;re gonna feel pretty silly when we &apos;re 80 years old ,
and you have to drive me down there
and then wait in the car for three days .
do what you want .
we &apos;re getting scalped tickets .
oh , i already found a guy online who &apos;s willing to sell .
how do you know this isn &apos;t a sting operation
set up by the comic @-@ con police ?
the same way i know
that the people in the tv set can &apos;t see me .
sheldon , just come with us .
you &apos;re not gonna make your own convention .
you know , there was a time
when comic @-@ con didn &apos;t exist at all
until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen .
and you mark my words--
i &apos;m gonna rip that guy off .
yes , i &apos;m starting my own comic book convention ,
and i thought that your client , robert downey jr . ,
would be perfect to appear on our first panel .
oh , well , now , why are you saying &quot; no &quot; ?
you haven &apos;t even asked him yet .
you know , excuse me ,
but i sat through iron man 2 .
i believe he owes me two hours of his time .
they hung up on me .
did you tell them that you &apos;re holding your convention
at a marie callender &apos;s ,
and that every panelist gets a free slice of pie ?
i didn &apos;t even get to that part .
look , even your friend wil wheaton thinks
this is a waste of time .
not true .
wil thinks this is a great idea .
he was just concerned that
he wasn &apos;t a big enough celebrity
to headline such an amazing event .
also , that &apos;s the same day that he shampoos his beard .
sheldon , buddy , i just don &apos;t think
this is going to come together for you .
you don &apos;t know that .
i still have plenty of solid leads on this list .
good luck .
no , wait .
i need you to call stan lee , leonard nimoy
and bill nye the science guy ...
&apos;cause , legally , i &apos;m not allowed to .
oh , and , also , carrie fisher ,
you know , &apos; cause i hear she can be pretty nuts .
后来沉迷毒品和酒精 还一度患上躁郁症
i can &apos;t believe leonard is
spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets .
last week , you spent that on a little dress .
yeah , but those tickets only get him into comic @-@ con.
that dress gets me into anywhere i want .
those tickets were pretty expensive .
i had to give howie an advance on his allowance .
now he &apos;s never gonna put his toys away .
why can &apos;t they do something sensible like sheldon
and start their own comic book convention ?
also , who wants to throw me out that window ?
oh , while they &apos;re acting like teenagers ,
we could do something grown @-@ up .
oh . you mean like a museum ?
yes , like a museum , but anything else .
oh , i know . there &apos;s a nice hotel not far from here
where they do afternoon tea .
ooh , afternoon tea-- how sophisticated of us .
oh , all right , if we &apos;re gonna be fancy ,
i should probably put on clean underwear .
la @-@ dee @-@ da !
look who has clean underwear .
no , we &apos;re gonna stop at target on the way .
hey , since sheldon &apos;s not going to comic @-@ con ,
maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as .
what if we go as the fantastic four ,
and just tell people that the invisible girl
is standing there with us .
oh , and i thought our days of pretending
to be with women who don &apos;t exist were over .
gentlemen , i am one step away
from securing a huge guest for my convention .
does that step include chloroform
and a roll of duct tape ?
i don &apos;t think that will be necessary
for mr. james earl jones .
you heard me .
the voice of darth vader ,
the lion king &apos;s dad ,
and fyi , the guy who says , &quot; this is cnn . &quot;
which also sounds like darth vader .
how are you gonna get james earl jones ?
simple . earlier today , he tweeted
that he &apos;s looking forward to going to
his favorite sushi restaurant for dinner .
i googled an interview from four years ago
which was conducted in his favorite sushi restaurant .
that &apos;s where he &apos;ll be , and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going ,
and ...
and that &apos;s where darth vader &apos;s
gonna pour soy sauce on your head .
sheldon , i don &apos;t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not ,
but please don &apos;t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy .
you &apos;re gonna get in trouble .
you &apos;re the ones who are going to get in trouble .
you &apos;re buying non @-@ transferable tickets .
and from a stranger , no less .
not only can you get banned from comic @-@ con ,
if caught , you could be charged with petty theft .
you think about that while i &apos;m warning james earl jones
about the danger of posting his location on twitter .
he got lucky this time .
there are some weirdoes out there .
forgot my keys .
okay , great . bye .
our friendly neighborhood scalper
says he &apos;s running late .
does he sound like a criminal ?
what do you mean ?
you know , did he say things like ,
&quot; youse guys , &quot; or &quot; listen here , see ? &quot;
yes . he @-@ he &apos;s late
because he &apos;s on his way here from 1940 .
i &apos;m just saying .
we don &apos;t know who this guy is .
what if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys ,
or make a suit out of our skins ?
why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe &apos; cause dark doesn &apos;t show the stains ?
well , now you &apos;re making me wonder
if we should have met him at a neutral location .
why do you think i told him to come to your place ?
there sure are a lot of little kids here .
i can &apos;t believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up .
i can &apos;t believe the waiter thought i was your daughter .
well , last time i got dressed up
and had tea was when i was five .
just me , my teddy bear , raggedy ann and my hamster .
that &apos;s cute .
it was .
till my hamster ate all her babies .
it got less cute really fast .
should we leave ?
well , there &apos;s a bar in the lobby .
i could go for a drink .
drinking in the afternoon , just like her mommy .
let me guess .
you like star wars .
you know , i &apos;ve been in other movies .
but you don &apos;t care about those , do you ?
i have one thing to say to people like you ...
i like star wars too .
care to join me ?
thank you .
my friend leonard said
if i bothered you while you were eating ,
you &apos;d think i was a creepy stalker .
well your friend leonard sounds like a real weenie .
he is , mr. earl jones , he is .
okay , so , i &apos;m on a comic @-@ con message board ,
and there &apos;s a post from a guy
where he says he got caught using someone else &apos;s badge ...
and sheldon was right--
he did get charged with petty theft . guys ...
if i go to jail dressed as the human torch ,
that might send the wrong message .
maybe this isn &apos;t a good idea .
i can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds .
do it .
okay .
we &apos;re officially not going to comic @-@ con.
hold on . we always do this .
do what ?
chicken out .
we &apos;re @-@ we &apos;re so afraid of getting into trouble
that we never do anything wrong .
that &apos;s &apos; cause we &apos;re the good guys .
even batman breaks the rules .
you know i struggle with batman .
i @-@ i say , this one time ,
instead of wimping out , let &apos;s be badasses !
okay , i &apos;ll be a badass--
but only if you pinky @-@ swear to be one , too .
howard , you in on this ?
no need .
i &apos;m breaking rules all the time .
name one .
last night .
drank my pepto straight out of the bottle .
what about that little cup they give you ?
yeah .
what about it ?
a @-@ are you impressed by that ?
a little .
yeah , me , too .
you know , when i first read the script for empire strikes back
and darth vader told luke he was his father ...
... i thought for sure he was lying .
me , too !
but he wasn &apos;t , was he ?
he was not !
how messed up was that ? !
so messed up .
what do you say let &apos;s go have some fun ?
my wife &apos;s in new york ,
and i got a lion king residual check
burning a hole in my pocket .
so , afternoon tea was a bust .
on the bright side , every six @-@ year @-@ old there
was jealous of my tiara .
not gonna lie-- it felt good .
let me ask you a question :
when did you guys start feeling grown up ?
&apos;cause i am not sure i do .
honestly , i thought when i got married i would ,
but i still kind of feel like i &apos;m pretending .
it doesn &apos;t help that most of my clothes come from gap kids .
okay , so i &apos;m an adult ,
and the other day i saw an old man slip and fall down ,
and i laughed .
i mean , i laughed hard .
like @-@ like , out loud .
if he was conscious , he would &apos;ve heard me .
oh , my gosh .
i know .
one of the tennis balls came off his walker
and bounced right off his head . i mean ...
i ... i almost wet myself .
i guess you had to be there .
i think i have you both beat .
imagine trying to feel like a grown @-@ up
when you &apos;ve never even been with a man .
okay , sex is not what makes you a grown @-@ up .
yeah . or you &apos;d be the oldest one here .
really ?
is that how you talk to your mother ?
he just parked . he &apos;s on his way up .
good . this is exciting .
it is . i feel alive .
yeah .
what if we do get caught ; who cares ?
so we get banned from comic @-@ con.
maybe slapped with a fine .
oh , no .
i &apos;ll be an astronaut and a bad boy--
how will women keep their pants on ?
uh , maybe it &apos;ll come up when i apply for citizenship .
oh , crap , what if it comes up when i apply for citizenship ?
i wonder if we &apos;d have to disclose something like this
when we apply for grants .
he &apos;s gonna be here any second-- what should we do ?
you guys are such babies .
i &apos;ll handle this .
if he thinks we &apos;re not home , he &apos;ll go away .
i thought you were a badass .
i lied about the pepto-- i always use the little cup !
is it true , as a child , you were a stutterer
and were functionally mute for eight years ?
it is true .
is it true they used scuba gear
to create the sound of darth vader breathing ?
they sure did .
is it true that you were premed in college
and you almost became a doctor ?
that &apos;s right .
oh , james !
i could listen to your stories all night .
i mean , really , what &apos;s so great about being grown up ?
well , for starters , we &apos;d be splitting this check three ways .
i &apos;m serious . who wants to do all that stuff ?
have insurance , pay mortgages ,
leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car .
i told you it was penny .
oh , come on , it wasn &apos;t me .
anyone could have knocked your mirror off ...
or whatever happened .
maybe the guys are right .
i mean , we spent the whole night trying to be mature ,
and it was kind of boring .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;re having more fun than we are .
oh , god , i could really use
exactly two tablespoons of pepto right now .
hey , los angeles !
i &apos;m on a ferris wheel with darth vader !
and he &apos;s nicer than you think !
i am !
* in the jungle , the mighty jungle *
* the lion sleeps tonight *
bring it home , mufasa .
穆法沙是狮子王的父亲
i don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re doing .
whose house is that ?
carrie fisher .
and she &apos;s a little crazy ,
so get ready to run .
it &apos;s not funny anymore , james !
then why am i laughing !
ah , sheldon , this is the perfect end
to a perfect night .
okay .
yeah , but i think it could have ended with the karaoke .
what were you trying to ask me at the strip club ?
how much does it cost to get them off my lap ?
no . something about a convention .
oh , right ! well ...
my friends and i couldn &apos;t get into comic @-@ con this year ,
and i was trying to start my own convention ,
and i was going to ask
if you would be a panelist .
why don &apos;t you and your friends come to comic @-@ con with me ?
really ?
of course .
and san diego is right across the border
from my favorite city on earth ,
tijuana ...
... where i &apos;m taking you every night !
ay @-@ yi @-@ yi .
ay @-@ yi @-@ yi , bang @-@ bang .
so , beau bridges is on my shoulders ,
and jeff bridges is on marlon brando &apos;s shoulders ,
and remember , we do not have permission to be in the pool--
hey ! sheldon , wake up !
and ...
angie dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us ,
and i go under the water and marlon goes under the water ,
and the water raises about two feet
and sloshes all over her patio ,
and the dogs freak out and run like hell ,
and then we run like hell ...
oh , boy !
that was a lot of fun .
uh ... who &apos;s angie dickinson ?
