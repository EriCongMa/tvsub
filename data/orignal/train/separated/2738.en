Fuck you doing? Scared the piss out of me.
Some things you don't get into over the phone.
Got it. Lorraine's at mass.
Watch out for Spencer.
Who?
Her fucking toy terrier's a shit machine.
I talked to some of the guys about your misgivings.
Yeah?
Listen, I've made a decision.
Take a walk in there.
What the fuck you waiting for? Get lost.
Historically, Carmine always said the Sopranos
are nothing more than a glorified crew.
Plain and simple,
we decapitate and we do business with whatever's left.
What?
Nothing.
I agree in spirit but I gotta counsel.
This should have been done during John's era.
They got redundant upper management,
bleeds off half the kick.
We take 'em out, absorb the whole fucking thing.
Take out an entire fucking family?
Let me tell you a couple or three things.
Forget Coco. Forget Fat Dom
who goes over to Jersey and never comes back.
Forget my brother Billy.
Phil, that's not what I'm saying at all.
Anthony Soprano has no respect for this thing.
He's never been in the can, not really.
He's a guy who stepped over his own uncle to grab the big seat.
His father's brother.
Please, huh?
I'm embarrassed.
I let him come to the hospital last Christmas
and I took his fat fucking hand in friendship.
Philly, you had a heart attack.
Listen to me. They make anybody and everybody over there.
And the way that they do it is all fucked up.
Guys don't get their finger pricked.
There's no sword and gun on the table.
Phil.
No, Alb.
Either it has meaning or no meaning.
And the Vito thing, the man harbours a faggot.
It's true.
Five fucking families
and we got this other pygmy thing over in Jersey.
There's no scraps in my scrapbook.
Make it happen.
I like the way she played basketball yesterday.
Almost got my first hard-on in a month.
Jesus, what's the meaning of quiet time around here?
Rhiannon?
AJ?
Jesus.
What are you doing here?
You first.
I have some food issues, depression.
You keep up with Hernan?
He's a slimeball.
I caught him finger-banging my cousin on the ski lift.
Somebody said you were modelling.
Yeah, I guess.
I signed with Elite.
So you would say he's responding to the therapy.
Well, we don't do traditional therapy per se.
Kids in crisis mostly need an environment of calm,
no stresses.
Do you want this? Or I can pop it in the mail.
Just one more week of this.
$2,200 a fucking day.
Gabagool', provolone
and vinegar peppers.
You believe this fucking weather?
End times, huh? Ready for the rapture.
How's the anti-terror going?
Great if you don't like sleeping,
eating or seeing your kids.
Listen, those Arabs from the Bing...
Let me ask you the truth.
They're in Jordan getting their balls zapped?
You're not gonna tell me?
I'm not really sure. For all we know,
they may be harmless pistachio salesmen.
Don't get so bent out of shape. You're a big boy, Tony.
You know, World War ll,
your outfit protected the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
You think Roosevelt told Vito Genovese
where Hitler was holed up?
Go fuck yourself.
Tony, hold up.
Tony
What?
Look, I appreciate what you did, giving us those names.
In fact, I've been sitting here thinking...
Remember that thing I told you about
that was supposed to happen about a year ago, your problem with Brooklyn?
It's on again, possibly.
You, maybe people close to you.
If it was solid you would have been warned by the Newark office,
but my colleague in Brooklyn,
the one with the collaborator,
snitch is implying the wheels have been set in motion.
Implying.
Where the fuck you been?
Krista fell off her shoes last night.
We had to call an ambulance.
I had some shit I was taking care of.
You're gonna want a snort.
Come on, I just finished my bialy.
Take it.
Burt Gervasi, he's gone.
What happened?
I didn't want to overload you with AJ in hospital.
I don't wanna hear that. Go.
Burt let me know the other night
he's been playing both sides of the fence with New York.
Burt?
Measures were taken.
Burt wasn't speaking for just himself.
Guys are getting squeezed hard to sway them
towards new management.
They thought you'd be a part of it.
And he got an answer.
My hope is maybe now Phil gets the message.
You know, we can talk this shit through.
Talk?
Talking about Phil.
We gotta hit first.
This dovetails with other information I got
that this cocksucker already has a target on my back.
It's a big move.
So...
Buddha.
When he stuck you with the tab for Vito Junior,
I said let it go.
Obviously, truth is, a fuck like Phil,
appeasement don't work.
Three pops within a tight time frame,
24 hours, so there's no chance for them to hit back.
Top three guys.
Paulie Gaultieri?
No, management.
Tony Soprano, obviously,
plus Silvio Dante and we think Bobby Baccalieri.
That mortadella's number three?
He used to be Junior Soprano's driver.
And you used to sell laser printers out the back of your Crown Vic.
You really slept.
Yeah.
I wasn't asleep.
You want some oatmeal? I'll make some.
Instant or the real thing? I have half and half.
I can't find my belt.
It must be up there somewhere.
What? You hid it?
I'll make the real thing.
You'll let me know when it's ready?
Sure.
You know, my game has got...
I have a casualty, he's urgent... In response,
the insurgents unleash a devastating wave of IEDs
and suicide bombers.
Who got hit? You got comms with them?
On a small but deadly road...
Anthony.
Regarding our friend with the grey hair,
I thought about it. I want you to call ltaly,
get some cousins of ours over.
Who you want to run the thing?
Got it.
Gotta get some tyres for Carmela's car.
The wine's amazing.
Jennifer's our resident ltalian wine expert.
Is Megan still in Prague, Stace?
Jesus, her love life. The girl she was involved with, Cecily,
she's now having a torrid pen-and-paper relationship
with an armed robber in Attica.
What is this fascination with criminals?
Rescue fantasy. They think they can fix them.
I'm worried for Cecily.
So I Googled any new stuff on sociopathic personalities.
Apparently, the talking cure...
helps them become better criminals.
It was fascinating.
The study was by Yochelson and Samenow.
Studies turn around every few years.
This other, I think it was Robert Hare,
suggested that sociopaths...
actually quite glibly engage on key issues
like mother, family.
I seem to remember that from residency.
Me too, and I've read Hare,
but who's a true sociopath?
I had a guy at the state asylum,
slow poisoner. They even mimic empathy.
They blubber and cry.
Did you put her up to this?
She just happened to mention this study?
Who? Me?
Everything OK down there?
I don't know.
It's a study. Food for thought.
She's blowing us off.
You just can't resist rubbing my face in it.
I feel like we should change the subject.
I only suggested you re-evaluate your work with Leadbelly
or be prepared to deal with moral
and possibly legal consequences.
Leadbelly? Who's that? Come on.
The answer is a female opera singer
and gangster...
Elliot!
Soprano.
Tony Soprano? He's your patient?
That's pretty cool.
Jesus Christ, Elliot.
Chill out. We're among friends.
We're all professionals.
So what's your verdict on the wine, Jen?
All ltalians have big noses.
If I had made that joke about...
other groups represented at this table,
I would be called a bigot.
I meant ltalian reds.
Still, it must be fascinating work.
It is.
Have a seat.
What's up?
Phil Leotardo.
Calls were made to zips. They're coming over from Naples.
You contact the guy to contact the guys.
Phil's at his goomah's every Friday night.
T know about this?
What?
What kind of question is that?
Watch your fat mouth.
Hey, whoa. What are you concerned about?
I lived through the '70s by
the skin of my nuts
when the Columbos were going at it.
There ain't a bigger cocksucker than Phil Leotardo.
I just wanna make sure somebody knows
there could be a line of Cozarellis a mile long.
Duly noted. So there's no problem, then.
It'll be fine.
Paulie, those guys are outside.
Fuck you talking so loud for?
Don't discuss this until we're in the pisciad?
It's all yours.
I just picked 'em up at the airport.
Anthony.
So what do you clear a year around here?
I don't mean to pry, just round numbers.
I'm asking because Meadow,
I told you she's taking pre-med classes,
well, she's not gonna be a doctor.
She told us.
It's kind of sad, isn't it?
Depends.
It's just a nice thing to be,
helping sick babies.
Her change of heart bothers you?
Her mother too, much more than me.
I mean, all that worry,
which private school, Columbia University,
this and that, and in the end
she'll get married, squeeze out some kids
after what, a couple years in the work force?
I'm still working.
Yeah, but you're divorced.
Criminal law, that's what she's taking up.
And I told Carmela it's not the end of the world.
She's interested in...
civil rights,Muslims and blacks
and that
and a dime.
Hopefully she'll wind up at a big firm,
white-collar crime.
Just,
you know, Dr Soprano.
Sounds nice.
Your parents must have been very proud.
I think so.
Look at all the people like me you've helped.
With all the human suffering in this world,
you've done something important,
Like those people
who are trying to help my son.
God bless 'em.
$2,000 a day in that place,
but if it helps...
And as you know, my plumbers' union insurance
only covers 10% of mental.
He's really hurting,
AJ.
And you?
Although, maybe,
you know what? Forget his hurts. Maybe I should have...
Put your shoe up his ass?
Yeah, frankly.
Well, we talked about this.
I talked about it.
Carmela...
Mollycoddled him.
My old man...
Are you a shining example
for the huge collection of wingtips and loafers
that must be lodged up your lower bowel?
What's the matter with you?
Is it because I said that about being divorced?
You were saying.
He's my only son.
He's young. Most of the time they pull out of this.
I've been depressed for years. What if he don't pull out?
So the boy who never cared about anything
now cares about too much.
Yeah, I guess.
And the daughter, like all females,
ultimately somehow disappoints.
I didn't say that.
What's with the tone?
You sound like you're glad
I'm taking it on the chin.
Maybe you're projecting hostile feelings.
Bullshit. If we had instant replay,
you'd see it in two seconds.
Well, we don't have instant replay.
I know that. Jesus Christ, you sound like my fucking wife.
Your "fucking wife.
You know what I mean.
The Departures magazine out there,
did you give any thought at all
to someone else who might wanna read it
before you tore out the entire page?
What?
It's not the first time you've defaced my reading materials.
You saw that?
People tear shit out of your magazines all the time.
They're a mess. I try to read 'em.
I don't think I can help you.
Change 'em. Bring in some new shit.
I mean therapeutically.
What are you talking about?
I've only missed three appointments since that heart-to-heart.
The new big thing these days is called
"psychodynamic therapy"
combined with Anafranil.
Who?
A medication. There's a doctor in Bloomfield
you could see.
OK. Now, what the fuck is this?
You're firing me
cos I defaced your Departures magazine?
I'm giving you my considered medical opinion.
OK, I should have asked you for the steak recipe.
And missing sessions,
unfortunately, is part of my condition.
What do you know about your condition?
You miss appointments because you don't give a shit
about commitments, about what I do,
about the body of work
that's gone into building up this science.
Go ahead, tell me again I sound like your wife.
Well, if the shoe fits...
We're making progress. It's been seven years.
Do you want some names?
OK, I'm gonna tell you something
and you're not gonna like it,
but we can say anything...
Go ahead!
I'm chalking this all up
to female menopausal situations.
You're not my gynaecologist.
You don't need a gynaecologist to know which way the wind blows.
So, wait a minute.
You're telling me
after all this time,
after everything we shared in here,
you're cutting me loose just as my son got out of the hospital
for trying to kill himself?
Since you are in crisis,
I don't want to waste your time.
I'm gonna be fucking honest.
As a doctor,
I think what you're doing is immoral.
Yes?
DHL.
Yes?
Package,
DHL Express for Mr Philip.
For sign.
For sign.
Yeah.
It's done.
The love interest got in the way.
Couldn't be helped, apparently.
You ever see Phil with the goomah?
Once, maybe. Why?
Could he talk to her in Ukrainian?
Ukrainian? The fuck do I know?
I gotta go.
Paulie, it's done.
Listen,
I quit therapy.
And this time I'm never going back.
Except for that slight improvement around the shooting,
she wasn't doing you much good.
Here we go.
Hi, strangers, how are you?
How are you?
Good, not bad.
Good.
There they are.
So Mead' was in here
with Patrick Parisi.
Yeah.
We are very happy.
Very happy.
Is it true what she said?
Yes, thank God. We are so relieved.
You know, with AlDS and...
It's not just that.
I don't know one doctor
who is advising his children to go into medicine.
Between the insurance companies over their shoulder,
the hospitals are making cutbacks...
She'd have been good at it.
Always intellectually curious, even as a tyke.
Does compassion come naturally to her?
Patience? I'm not so sure.
What are you talking about?
So what is she gonna do now?
Well...
Law.
Constitutional law.
What about AJ? How's he doing?
He's good. He's good.
Good.
Tone, you know who's in tonight?
"Mangenius."
He's the Jets' coach, sweetie.
I should go say hello.
OK.
So Mead' and Patrick Parisi?
Little awkward, though, maybe.
Patsy still works for Tony. He's an underling.
Cupid's dart lands, you know?
I'm gonna send some limoncellos over in celebration.
Great.
You don't answer your fucking phone?
I tried you 50 times last night.
We shut 'em off.
Gab came down with terrible food poisoning.
You can pass the word upstairs. The grey goose is gone.
Good.
The goomah had to be taken out too.
But I say, who gives a fuck?
Remember that drunken scene she caused at the Jersey Boys party?
I actually felt bad for Phil.
What's the matter?
Whenever I think of that fucking play,
I picture Ma dying alone
like a dog on that bus.
You're gonna make someone happy with this news today.
Think I'll ask for some time off.
Who does this look like? Look.
Don't cry. Good little girls don't cry. Babies cry.
Hey.
How's it going?
Good.
Have my card game.
Carm volunteered to take Nica.
Emptying the pool?
Costs a fortune to heat.
Yeah.
What can I do you for?
Had a call from Mario Diaco.
Who's that?
Uncle Jun's accountant.
The one with the artificial voice box.
Says he's been trying to reach you for two weeks.
Uncle Jun's finally out of money.
They think that maybe there's some squirrelled around,
but he can't remember.
It's a fucking sin, isn't it?
Plus, with the larynx,
he thinks Mario's from outer space, so...
The upshot is he can't pay
for living at Wycoff Psychiatric any more
and they're gonna move him to a state facility.
I know, Tony,
but Jesus, those fucking places are snake pits.
Then he'll make some new friends.
I understand.
You gonna bail him out?
We don't have that kind of money. We'd contribute.
Bobby feels...
you know.
Right.
You got a lot of balls coming to me.
And as for your husband, Janice,
Exile On Main Street.
Don't say that.
You trust a guy, you bring him along
and for what?
He feels sorry for Junior?
Bullshit.
Tone, it's bad news.
Paulie said he wants it known it's on him,
he takes full responsibility,
but that he didn't do nothing.
Shit.
Yeah, nobody,
I mean nobody, knows where the fuck Phil is,
four or five days now.
So we never really had a shot at him.
How about the house in Florida?
I had Beans send somebody past.
The house is all shuttered up.
He put everything in place, his moves on us.
He goes into hiding, waits it out.
Going to ground, they call it.
Who?
It's an expression.
Who knows what the fuck he's got planned?
Get word to everybody. Eyes in the back of your head.
Break routines, collections, all that shit.
You tell everybody.
Got it.
In the meantime, we keep trying. Get a 20 on Phil.
Beautiful.
You never see a Blue Comet in that condition.
I mean, look at the coaches.
Every window still lights up.
If that train still ran New York to AC,
Atlantic City would be a much different place today.
Better class of people.
I suppose.
Who the fuck really knows?
Still, it's nice to think that.
Imagine riding in that club car,
sipping on a Negroni.
Eight grand the whole set?
There's other people interested.
I'm gonna go for it.
Your son will like this too.
Looks fast.
He don't care.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake.
All right.
If I'm working away from the office I should have this stuff.
Wanna make yourself useful?
Get the girls' pay slips over there.
Put 'em in a bag. Or give 'em to me.
Come on.
All right.
Let's go.
Yeah, that's them there.
Fuck!
Let's get the hell out of here.
Wait here.
Melissa found a memory stick in my Prada bag
that wasn't printed.
God, remember what a dick this guy was at first?
Yeah.
I need to talk to you.
Nobody called you?
No. What's the matter?
Bobby's dead. He's shot. Sil's in the hospital.
What happened?
Could be several things.
Leave here?
Till we get the situation under control.
What does that mean?
Help me out here. Don't argue.
They're after you?
We should split up.
You and the kids go. I'll be somewhere else.
Oh, my God.
Families don't get touched. You know that.
I wanna know every night
that you're not sitting here out in the open.
Where should I go? Where will you go?
The house you bought,
the estate sale, go there.
Jesus.
A hotel, then. It doesn't matter.
OK.
You all right?
We gotta get moving.
Like I said, it's just a precaution.
What about your sister?
She'll know by now.
We'll stop over there after we're cleared out of here.
And Gab? How bad is Sil?
We'll make some calls.
Maybe I should go ahead of you to Jan's.
Meadow is basically living at Patrick's.
AJ, how will you get him to go along?
He won't leave the house.
He'll leave the house.
Tony.
On a piece of plywood
if necessary, but he's gonna leave the house.
Anything I can do?
No. You heard?
Or maybe I should just leave.
I'll call you.
It says Shukrijumah brought nuclear material
into the country from Mexico in 2002.
Fuck.
Leave us alone, hon.
Hang downstairs.
Better yet, don't.
You just bust in? We could have been doing anything.
Yeah, but what were you doing? Nothing.
We're just friends.
All right, listen.
Come on, sit up.
Come on.
Your Uncle Bobby's dead.
What?
He's dead. He got shot.
What do you mean, he got shot?
Listen to me,
and I don't have any time to go into a debate about any of this.
And it's important that we all leave for a little while
until things settle down.
What? Holy fuck.
It's just a precaution.
The point is
that I'm gonna be dependent on you to help out your mother.
Help out how?
Just do what she asks.
You know, chores, tasks,
whatever.
And don't add to the problem.
What do you mean? What the fuck did I do?
Don't break her balls, all right?
Just help her
with Aunt Janice, whatever.
Uncle Bobby's dead.
Yeah.
This is really depressing to me.
He was a good guy.
I was already having so much trouble maintaining...
My tailbone!
Here, pack a bag.
Now!
You won't need no sandals or fucking resort wear.
I'll be waiting downstairs.
Oh, my God.
I called the hospital. They wouldn't give no info on Sil.
Gab's brother finally phoned back.
Doctors don't think he'll recover consciousness.
Look at the stems on blondie.
He's riding high.
Nice to be young.
I'm gonna bunk down here.
All right, you go take care of your wife,
that flu.
You too.
Where the fuck I gotta be?
Yeah, I'm gonna stay.
We order a pizz'?
Yeah.
Get some meatballs and sausage.
You probably don't even hear it when it happens.
