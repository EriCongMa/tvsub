i did not care for varinius &apos; hand upon you .
nor i.
the girl , naevia .
what did he say ?
dead .
the slaver told not of her death ,
but of her suffering in the mines !
i stand with crixus . and will see naevia from bondage .
i move for vesuvius .
those that would live , join me .
noble varinius !
i offer apologies .
my soldiers have been set to higher purpose !
into the mines , quickly !
at this very moment ,
they close on spartacus !
you &apos;re safe , you &apos;re safe now .
crixus ?
take naevia to a safe place !
第四集
naevia !
halt !
swing around to the left !
i got her !
you made me run .
i fucking hate running .
i would see tychos to ground .
far from roman hands .
more come .
right !
there is no time for it .
it does not fucking matter .
we shall all join him soon .
spartacus shall fall .
is that not the reason for my presence in capua ?
to shit with reason .
the absence of your troops from the games
was an insult to good varinius .
the republic would bear far greater slight ,
were i to turn from purpose .
seppius has been searching for the thracian for months .
how came you to divine he would make attempt on the mines at lucania ?
because the gods themselves presented it ,
through voice of humble servant .
lucretia ?
her counsel moved my hand .
perhaps your course was justified then .
i pray it true .
otherwise offense has been made upon the ramblings of a madwoman .
we have moved past this , ilithyia .
in spirit , at least .
let us make it a thing of the flesh , with celebration .
here within these walls , to pay tribute owed .
an excellent notion !
well received , yes ?
it would stand the more grievous insult to refuse .
you honor me .
the honor is mine .
i only thought to help .
by plying that preening shit
with celebration in our own house ?
our house is in rome , gaius .
and i would speed return .
with varinius &apos; support , you will have seppius &apos; men .
now worth their weight in piss .
when marcus returns to us with spartacus as lucretia --
you place too high a value on her .
she will drag us to ruin when it plummets .
lucretia continues to prove herself
worthy of such estimation .
would that my own wife held the same .
spartacus .
she needs a moment .
she needs to fucking move .
how quickly would your feet carry ,
after months condemned to that place ?
she is not alone in needing rest .
the lack of it sets nerve to edge .
we will find higher ground ,
better defended if set upon .
can you walk but a little more ?
she will make it .
come on .
the weight of her increases with each step .
perhaps it is time to lighten burden .
i swore a promise to crixus .
she is the man &apos;s heart .
would you again tear it from his chest ?
crixus is dead .
and i would be free of his woman ,
before we fucking share the same fate .
we move for vesuvius , to rejoin agron .
all of us .
speak of this again
and the romans will be the least of your concerns .
tychos .
one of the lesser men .
let him serve as a warning .
that rome is not so easily defied .
their numbers dwindle .
yet ours follow at more rapid pace .
we still hold the greater sum .
spartacus and his men are gladiators .
a handful of your men would stand pale shadow against one--
roman soldiers know something of death ,
and the dealing of it .
do not measure their worth against common slaves .
slaves , true .
but far from common .
move absent proper force ...
and see the rank of the dead swell .
your men are spread too thin throughout the forest .
a single man carried by swift purpose
could return with reinforcements ...
carry word to the other squads .
we do not rest .
tribune--
see this to its end
in the name of gaius claudius glaber .
turn from your charge ,
and i &apos;ll put a sword in your fucking back .
varinius is a man of the highest regard .
see his cup always full
and all desires met .
am i understood ?
domina .
yes , domina .
bathe and prepare yourselves .
seppia .
apologies , i was not told of your arrival .
none required .
i came seeking lucretia &apos;s counsel .
a thing desired by many it would seem .
your words set her to path .
mine ?
you are forever extolling the virtues of marriage .
wisdom of years has finally proven master over fatuous youth .
you &apos;ve found a husband so quickly ?
if the gods bless such a union .
i shall entreat them on your behalf .
with their favor , varinius shall be yours .
varinius ?
is he not handsome ?
and tall and strong and of means ?
the form of a man every woman longs to call her own !
he would make a husband to rival all others .
i must prepare myself for his celebration .
i would catch his eye ,
and with it see the rest of him swiftly follow .
you have made impression upon her .
as have you .
no longer is pilgrimage needed to delphi .
those seeking the consideration
of the gods need only bow to the oracle of capua .
i am but humble vessel ,
offering a mere taste of their will .
then seppia shall find tonight a bitter draught .
varinius is a praetor .
as is your husband .
yet varinius rises more quickly ,
and one day shall hold title of consul .
the wife of such a man must possess refinement and poise .
traits yet lacking in a spoiled little girl .
perhaps you would have me petition the gods for a different union ?
one closer to heart ...
the morning cock has better chance of crowing to such heights .
your husband believes otherwise .
as does your father .
when marcus returns absent spartacus ,
you shall be revealed as what you are .
an empty vessel , barren of life and prophecy .
see yourself dressed for tonight .
i have no doubt my husband will wish to parade you about as favored pet .
your husband &apos;s trust is valued gift .
yet yours would prove the greater treasure .
line them up .
the faith placed in me is not mislaid .
spartacus proves where i predicted .
praetor .
this is all that stand captured ?
many more lay dead in the mines .
your gaul returns to you at least .
where is spartacus ?
he fled into the woods with a clutch of slaves .
marcus gives chase .
alert me the moment he is sighted upon road .
to the cells .
move !
even aided by your divine guidance ,
he stands with empty hands .
he will yet find spartacus between them .
the gods --
your tongue writhes absent their purpose .
was naevia not found in the mines , as i foretold ?
and who so condemned her to such a place ?
juno ?
or a lanista &apos;s wife , more earthly bound ?
your prophecies bear the stench of opportunity .
oenomaus--
was delivered by your dead husband &apos;s man .
a toad who has seen his share of wounds .
i wonder if he could mend them as well ...
do not think me the fool , as my husband and father .
you and i have unfinished affairs .
and i would see them draw to a close .
get in !
again to this house of piss and shit .
a fate i alone should bear .
the risk was known to us all .
fuck risk and fuck the fucking romans .
i stand with you , in this life and the next .
as do i.
the bonds of brotherhood .
they have always run deep within these walls .
oenomaus !
what has happened ?
how did you come here ?
i was a fool .
that now stands in fellow company .
their fault lies only in following me on impossible journey .
naevia lives .
we liberated her from the mines .
love .
you fall to ruin for love .
she is my heart .
she is a woman .
a delicate creature at the best of times .
they are moved by desires unknown
by the men that place trust in them .
she lives .
that is all that matters .
you are safe now .
you are safe .
you do not rest ?
i would not see another of us fall .
not even the gods could have done more to prevent it .
a thought holding no comfort to the dead .
naevia .
liscus !
nasir !
he risked life , to save my own .
a most impressive showing !
it staggers to think this house so recently a tomb .
these walls truly present no evidence of witnessed horrors .
such memories shall soon be cleansed from thought ,
never again to darken mind .
i long for such a day .
let us hasten it with ample libation .
i fear mercato may lose himself in the bottom of a cup ,
and forget that we are of position .
i would never make spectacle of myself .
come then !
i would test the strength of your resolve .
and my own as well !
i have never beheld sour gallienus in such high spirits .
this celebration already proves clever suggestion .
to be made brilliant , if spartacus &apos; capture were to be announced .
the gods may yet bless us this night with unexpected gifts .
let us entreat them with wine and song !
our voices to carry to olympus itself !
this house once sat perched within its reach .
i have worshipped here myself upon occasion .
good cossutius .
i had not heard you were in capua .
he comes for my games .
and to remove himself from the prudish eyes of rome .
both just cause .
come .
let us enjoy spectacle .
truly a feast for the senses .
even i stand speechless .
then i shall seize upon rare moment ,
to honor noble guest .
good citizens of capua !
your presence here in this house once stood cursed
is testament to your courage and faith .
faith not only in me ,
in the body of the senate as well .
represented by beloved albinius
and noble varinius .
a man worthy of celebration for his generosity
in providing distraction with games
to ease troubled thoughts !
see how they admire you .
the girl takes your counsel to heart .
and i repay your kind attendance
with welcome news of retribution .
my soldiers return with news
of spartacus &apos;imminent capture ...
and offer in advance the lives
of the few surviving remnants of his most trusted men .
these gladiators ... these slaves ,
were responsible for the deaths of many of your noble kin .
and they will pay ....
with blood .
praetor varinius .
pressing concerns forced hand in preventing my men
from presenting at your games .
i offer you the lives of these enemies of rome ,
to balm unintentional wounds .
cut the pig !
come on , we want blood !
gratitude for this honor .
and for your tireless pursuit of the villain spartacus .
yet i cannot accept .
i cannot accept because to do so
would rob the people of this city of deserved pleasures .
let these men not fall here tonight
in the honor of a single man ,
but in the arena before all of capua !
water !
drink .
the boy fought well .
would this were wine ,
to send him properly on his way .
you speak of him as if already gone .
then he speaks the truth .
we have settled this .
come to reason .
there is more blood upon the ground than yet within him .
even if we carry him , he will not survive .
but he will leave a trail .
one that the romans shall follow .
we cannot just leave him .
no . we cannot .
you would take his life ?
i would but sever dangling thread .
it would be a kindness .
you will not touch him .
then do it yourself .
put him from misery , as you did varro --
crixus .
he survived worse .
against theokoles .
the boy too will live .
if his wound is sealed with fire .
a fire would call the romans down upon us .
then we must be quick ,
and be gone before they arrive .
and if we are not ?
we do not have enough men .
no . we do not .
find agron and bring all to purpose .
we will follow as swiftly as we are able .
i fear it will not be swift enough .
trussed as game awaiting slaughter ,
yet the man still eyes us as prey .
the fire will soon be put from rebellious eyes .
a fitting end to your games , varinius .
it shall be a day etched in memory .
i cannot wait to see their blood spill upon the sands .
nor i.
yet should they not fall here ,
in the very place they robbed our beloved cousin sextus of his life ?
a man dearly missed .
it is a pity he shall not be honored this night .
would the greater honor not be before all of capua ?
we are politicians , are we not ?
let us come to middle ground ,
and see everyone satisfied .
choose a single man ,
and let us make sport of him in memory of your cousin .
a most judicious compromise !
seppius is not the only one who stands injured .
the gods themselves took note of the horrors inflicted upon lucretia .
and pluck her from the shores of the afterlife
to voice their desires .
should she not choose what blood is shed
beneath roof she once claimed her own ?
she has been most sorely grieved .
if there are no objections ... ?
what mortal dares defy the gods ?
only one who would draw their wrath .
varinius has seen fit to allow us
a taste of the blood to come .
a single man ,
to be sacrificed to this house
where so many lives were stolen
by spartacus and his jackals .
to be chosen by its former domina ,
the gods themselves guiding her hands .
the gods have chosen .
this one .
we shall draw lots ,
and cut but shallow to prolong the game .
seppius to stand first ,
in honor of fallen cousin !
fuck the lot of you roman cunts !
do not think that the gods have shown you mercy .
i but delay your passing , so that i may savor it .
my life is gladly given .
for naevia &apos;s .
she lives ?
far from your fucking grasp .
news greeted with joy .
i would have her hear of your final moments .
in the arena you held so dear .
and the crowd which once cheered your name spitting upon you .
and when you fall , it will not be as champion .
but as a common slave .
absent honor and absent glory
and your name forever lost to history .
let this shit speak now of romans !
first blood has been drawn !
who stands next ? !
remember , do not cut too deep .
i would not deprive everyone fair turn !
varinius in town but a handful of days ,
and already outshines your husband .
the man does exude presence .
the breast !
but your heart was always set upon gaius .
it is a deceitful thing that has led many astray .
yet mistakes of youth need not forever haunt maturity .
you would see marriage dissolved ?
i do not hold such power .
that decision lies in trusted father .
gaius is not without considerable fault .
yet it would not lend favorably upon our name .
you carry his child ,
and he yet holds position of praetor .
he is not the only one with such title .
it would seem the gods favor less mature schemes .
strike it from your thoughts , as i have from mine .
he is fading .
fetch something for him to clutch between teeth .
when it is done ,
we must smother fire and move quickly .
i &apos;ve seen that look .
and the blame it inflicts inward .
none other deserve it .
we chose to do this .
even fucking liscus .
glaber does not send his men against liscus .
he sends them against me .
and all suffer because of it .
yes .
it is because of you .
that we are free .
what are you doing ?
we must close your wound .
i am to be branded with fire .
as a true gladiator would .
you have earned your place among the brotherhood .
hold him down .
do not cry out .
the fire ! quickly !
take my sword ! go !
come , it is your turn .
i have never held one before .
my brother would not allow it .
well , then it falls to more experienced hands to guide you .
come .
you do not care for your master &apos;s affections ?
i am slave to no man .
yet you bow and scrape toward varinius &apos; purpose .
but aids me in pursuit of spartacus .
i would have done so as well .
absent attempt to fuck your sister .
magistrate .
a word .
now place the tip against flesh ,
and feel it part at your desire .
i ...
i cannot .
apologies --
our honored guest asks too much of inexperienced hands .
your wife does not shy from taking life .
that is how you sate desire ,
for love or vengeance .
without hesitation .
it is a sight , is it not ?
all of capua laid at your feet .
it is not the view , but quiet respite
from celebration that draws me .
and i have shattered it with prattling tongue .
apologies .
linger .
i would not sweep you from perch once your own .
it seems a lifetime ago i called it so .
time flees from us all .
leaving regret for what might have been churning in our wake .
i fear we share much in such regard .
a husband lost .
a wife ...
dearly missed .
let us turn to common joy ,
of friend and daughter .
ilithyia .
the name fails to lighten troubled thoughts .
give them voice , and see them fly to the heavens .
i have not the lungs to shout so loud .
then whisper desire to me .
and i shall entreat the gods to see them satisfied .
your counsel would be much appreciated .
where &apos;s fortis ?
we avoided one squad of romans .
a second we could not .
i lost fortis in the woods as we fled .
which direction ?
the one which you travel in .
we shall break to the west ,
and hope to miss them before righting course .
and if we do not ?
then they shall learn that a wounded animal may yet bare teeth .
you overreach .
and hot tears burn in result .
turn from him .
and dry your eyes .
let us leave this fucking house .
and see memory of this night fade in warm embrace .
yes , brother .
crassus , yes !
yes , i have dined and bathed with him upon many occasion .
a man large of coin ...
small of cock .
his wife has often spoken of it .
in far grander terms .
seek more wine .
i shall join you presently .
your eye flits from young to younger still .
if celebration stretches ,
i fear to discover you with a newborn clutched in hand .
ilithyia , i would not see my jest
towards crassus reach his ear .
and what do you offer to purchase my silence ?
what is it you seek ?
favor for your husband ?
i have secured many for him over the years .
perhaps it is time to place
myself higher in concern ...
it would be well deserved .
why do you chase after simple little girls ,
barely formed of breast ?
they are unencumbered .
of marriage ...
and obligation ...
and if a woman your equal stood removed from such ?
we speak in ever tightening circles .
i would see them come to a point ...
my father never favored gaius .
if a more suitable husband
with equal title
and greater promise were to make his intentions known ...
you play a dangerous game .
with stakes worth the risk .
your name ...
wed to my father &apos;s ...
power and wealth
to rival crassus himself ...
gain your father &apos;s approval to dissolve your marriage ...
and find me as wet with desire as you now stand .
fuck the gods .
fortis .
back the way we came .
liscus !
did i not fucking warn you ?
a serious wound .
but you should live if --
call the remaining squad .
it will not make a difference .
spartacus is possessed by the gods themselves --
spartacus is here !
bear arms !
you will draw them to us !
and we will fight until the last drop of roman blood --
i am not a roman .
and i will not fucking die this night .
we must move before more come .
i am done running .
do not fucking let this be for nothing .
live ...
and see many romans fall ...
you really believe this will save you ?
maneuvering my father &apos;s cock inside you ?
you mistake intent --
do not attempt to twist fucking word to advantage .
i will not be placed beneath your heel again ,
you withered cunt .
you think so low of me ?
based upon lasting memory of blood and betrayal .
i &apos;ve done many things to hurt you .
because i was jealous .
of your position and your beauty .
your youth .
moved by base passions which served only
to wound my own heart .
i would do anything , ilithyia .
to erase injury my actions have caused .
you remember what happened between us ?
i remember everything .
do not think i will be so easily threatened .
again , you mistake intent --
mistake is yours .
i will dash your head against the stones
as i did licinia ...
wait !
with tales of how you lost wits and came to me .
your father --
will not mourn the passing of a faded whore .
he will dissolve your marriage !
that is the reason i took him to my thighs .
to sway him to your cause of wedding varinius .
that is what you desire , is it not ?
even if it were , why would my father
be moved by serpent &apos;s tongue ?
the gods speak through me .
he sees wisdom in their counsel .
i did it for you , ilithyia .
to secure future for you and your child .
i would mend rift between us .
one torn by my own foolish hands .
perhaps it is i that have been foolish .
to ever doubt such dear friend
was blessed by the gods .
laughter and drink have done much
to dispel darkening gloom .
good .
but yet i fear shall see split head come morning .
you stand satisfied then ?
in all things .
let us set past aside , and look towards deserving future .
words of significant worth .
come , i would break more with you before sleep claims us .
apologies for earlier doubt .
this evening has proven most advantageous .
yes .
i long to see what dawn shall bring .
vesuvius .
how far ?
half a day &apos;s journey .
take nasir .
i will hold them back for as long as i am able .
no .
i stay by your side .
