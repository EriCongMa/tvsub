yo , what are you waiting for ?
there &apos;s a plane ! look out !
wait , wait
plane behind you !
look out ! a plane !
look out ! look out !
take cover !
don &apos;t be afraid , my friend .
i can &apos;t .
you know , buddy , i got to tell you , i &apos;d be way more impressed
with your ninja skills if ,
a the door was locked , b , you didn &apos;t call and get the room number .
well , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint . next time ,
i &apos;ll come through the window , okay ?
oh , wait a minute . there are no windows .
do me a favor , please . okay , this is obviously temporary
until i find something different ,
and more importantly than that , this place isn &apos;t haunted .
not haunted ?
you run a blue light over this apartment ,
the last thing you &apos;re gonna be worried about is ghosts , my friend .
you know what i &apos;m saying ?
what are we watching ?
enemy mine ?
that &apos;s awesome . i feel like i &apos;m in a time machine .
like a tiny , little , really badly @-@ decorated time machine .
okay .
i like this movie . okay ?
i think it &apos;s a classic .
you have to pause ...
buh @-@ buh . if you &apos;re gonna be here ,
i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to sit quietly
and give this cinematic masterpiece
the attention it deserves , okay ?
can you do that ?
yup .
thank you .
that &apos;s disgusting .
you okay ?
huh ?
i mean , you want a tissue or something ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing &apos;s the matter .
you weren &apos;t moved by that
little moment right there , that scene ?
evidently not as much as you .
oh , well , i &apos;m sorry .
okay , i &apos;m sorry that i got drawn in to a beautiful film
about sacrifice and friendship .
i apologize .
the dude just gave birth .
he &apos;s an alien , okay ?
they got different plumbing on this planet .
okay , i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;re all hermaphrodites
i just didn &apos;t understand why you were crying , okay ?
or whatever .
it &apos;s kind of like ... i mean ...
i &apos;m not ... did i cry ?
you know what ? forget it . forget it . forget it .
forget it . you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like
to be a father , you don &apos;t understand .
you know what i could do ? i &apos;ll find a cartoon .
okay , speaking of cartoons ,
are you planning on bringing gracie here ?
because if you are ,
as a law enforcement official , i &apos;m required
to call the department of child protective services .
oh , you think you &apos;re funny .
i &apos;m gonna give it a medium . it &apos;s okay .
a cultureless ...
shh . mcgarrett .
... animal .
yeah , we &apos;re on the way .
put your shoes on .
the victim &apos;s name is monica jennsen , 28 .
she was an ice agent .
body was brought ashore by the coast guard .
this is special agent in charge , jeff morrison , her supervisor .
how you doing ?
wish we would have met under better circumstances .
lori &apos;s told me a lot about you guys and your team .
oh , so you guys know each other ?
we worked together on a federal task force a few years ago .
we &apos;re really sorry to hear you lost an agent .
i appreciate that .
what makes you guys think that this was anything
more than mechanical problems with the plane ?
initially , i did think that ,
but then i got on scene , and they said
the medical examiner has concerns about possible foul play .
max is with the body at the end of the pier .
okay . and now she was the only one on board ?
yeah , just her . the surfers that pulled her
from the plane are pretty positive about that .
none of this makes any sense .
she wasn &apos;t even scheduled to fly today .
what kind of case was jennsen working on lately ?
mostly routine stuff .
comparing shipping numbers
and cargo weights to customs manifest .
and if she came across something unusual ,
she was supposed to loop me in .
you think maybe she got in over her head this time ?
maybe . she was a quick study , eager to impress ,
but she was definitely green .
what about her red book ? can we see that ?
yeah , i can get that out of her office .
wait , wait , wait . what &apos;s a red book ?
it &apos;s an investigator &apos;s day @-@ to @-@ day diary .
they turn it into their supervisor at the end of the week
so we know exactly what they &apos;ve been working on .
all right , we &apos;re definitely gonna need that ,
plus , any active case files .
absolutely . whatever you guys need .
all right , great . thanks .
we know anything yet ?
all i can give you right now are my preliminary observations .
however , it &apos;s exactly those observations
that give me reason for concern .
as you can see , the victim
show signs of swelling around the tongue
and tenseness around the throat muscles .
there &apos;s no bruising from the impact ,
or water in the lungs , which leads me to believe
that she was dead before the impact .
and i &apos;m thinking cod
was most likely poisoning .
and what about tod ?
well , based on liver temperature ,
i &apos;d say at least eight hours ago .
what kind of plane was she in ?
a cessna 177 cardinal .
177 ? you sure about that ?
positive . why ?
because the cessna 177 &apos;s fuel tank
gives it a maximum flight time of just over four hours .
so she couldn &apos;t have been flying the plane .
that &apos;s right . agent jennsen was dead
long before that plane even took off .
jeff ?
jeff ?
yeah , i looked , um ...
looked everywhere , and her ... her , um ...
her red book &apos;s not in here .
maybe she took it home with her .
yeah . maybe .
listen , i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s always tough losing someone you work with .
yeah .
monica reminded me a lot of you .
hardworking , motivated , stubborn .
all in the best possible way , of course .
of course .
she did not deserve to die like this .
i know .
we &apos;re going to find who did this , i promise .
i want to help .
so , i &apos;ve been scanning through jennsen &apos;s case file .
it &apos;s just like morrison said .
it &apos;s all lightweight stuff .
tracking shipping containers , verifying way bills .
so what got her killed ?
what about the plane &apos;s recovery ?
the ntsb investigative team isn &apos;t due
to arrive on site until later today .
all right , well , listen . speed that up , okay ?
we need to find out what &apos;s on that flight recorder .
roger that .
hey . did you get jennsen &apos;s red book ?
not yet . it wasn &apos;t in her office .
i &apos;m gonna try her home .
danny and i will meet you there .
okay .
yeah , you got good taste in humans , huh ?
what are you doing ?
he &apos;s waiting for agent jennsen to come home .
all right , danny , take the kitchen , we &apos;ll take the living room .
let &apos;s find that red book .
i &apos;ve got signs of forced entry through the back window .
can you believe this ? somebody tried to drug the dog
i &apos;d like to kill them .
geez . doesn &apos;t look like the place was tossed .
well , maybe they knew exactly what they were coming for .
take a look at this .
these are surveillance photos .
maybe it &apos;s a case she was working on .
yeah . i mean , definitely a fresh case .
look at the date stamp . it &apos;s two days ago .
guys , i found the red book .
that &apos;s weird . last few pages are torn out .
no way jennsen did this .
why do you say that ?
these books-- they &apos;re subject to subpoena .
by law , they have to remain intact .
she wouldn &apos;t risk losing a case over missing pages .
maybe that &apos;s what the burglar was after .
what kind of a moron would break into a house ,
try to drug a dog , just to get some pages out of a book ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , you &apos;re better off just taking the whole thing .
all right , listen , we need to get this stuff back and analyzed .
lori , have fong run that book for prints .
okay .
come here , buddy .
oh , i got you . come here .
hey , what are you doing , danny ?
what do you mean , what am i doing ?
the csu &apos;s on their way right now .
this guy &apos;s contaminating a crime scene .
we got to take him with us .
he &apos;s not riding in the car .
what do you want me to do , tie him to the bumper ?
come on .
can you explain to me again why i &apos;m sitting in the back
and the dog is riding shotgun ?
i already told you , he needs the window .
oh , yes , right . how else is he gonna enjoy his tour of waikiki ?
you know , for your information , dogs get carsick .
really ?
yeah , it &apos;s a fact .
oh , it &apos;s a fact ?
yeah .
so , all of a sudden you &apos;re a dog expert ?
no , not all of a sudden ; i &apos;ve had dogs my entire life .
really ? you didn &apos;t have a dog when i met you .
yes , i did , but i lost the dog in the divorce .
rachel got custody of my dog .
what happened to it ?
he was old .
he died in the quarantine process .
which is another reason why i hate this miserable island .
guess that makes two of you .
yeah , buddy , i knew i liked this guy for a reason .
here &apos;s what agent jennsen had on her camera .
she took about eight photos . all of the same guy .
okay , can you punch in closer ?
i can do better than that .
i &apos;ll run his face through dmv database using facial recognition .
you read my mind .
all right , we got a match .
liam miller , 40 .
ncic shows no criminal record .
not even a speeding ticket .
why would agent jennsen follow around a guy like that ?
maybe he &apos;s an ex @-@ boyfriend .
all right , thank you very much .
that was the coast guard .
they &apos;re at the crash site pulling the black box
from jennsen &apos;s plane right now . we gotta go .
what about liam miller ?
kono , grab chin , see if you can find miller .
and i want to find out why jennsen was following him .
all right .
okay .
ready ?
hold up a second . what are you doing with the dog ?
i &apos;m gonna take him to an animal shelter .
when ?
when i have time .
mr. miller , we just need
to ask you some questions about agent jennsen .
oh , yeah , i ... ah , i saw that on the news .
what a horrible accident .
it wasn &apos;t an accident-- she was murdered .
murdered ? oh , my ...
is that pakalolo ?
oh ... yeah .
oh , sorry . um ...
yeah , here &apos;s my card .
i have a doctor prescription .
i &apos;m a cancer patient .
i use medical marijuana to help with my
anxiety and appetite .
the chemo side effects were pretty brutal .
sorry to hear it .
well , well , it &apos;s okay .
they say i &apos;m one of the lucky ones ; my tumor &apos;s shrinking .
so how did you meet agent jennsen ?
well , uh , she came to talk to me a few days ago ,
asked for my help .
she was investigating a smoke shop where i buy marijuana .
did agent jennsen give you any details as to why she was
investigating a place that sold medical marijuana ?
the smoke shop &apos;s not exactly a legitimate caregiver .
i guess agent jennsen thought they were selling to anyone .
not just cardholders like me .
oh . here &apos;s the ... actually ...
here &apos;s the place .
she said she was gonna get back to me , but she never did , so ...
i just assumed that she handled the problem without me .
yeah , unfortunately , she never had the chance to .
i &apos;ve handled cases like this before .
there &apos;s a lot of money in selling medicinal marijuana .
enough to kill an ice agent over ?
that sounds like a plan .
uh , let me call you back later .
me , too .
what ?
you don &apos;t have to keep it a secret .
i know you &apos;re back with malia .
relax , cuz . i &apos;m cool with it .
you are ?
yeah .
when did you turn the corner on that one ?
when i was relieved of duty , she came to my house
&apos;cause you were worried about me .
really ?
that &apos;s when i realized she still loved you .
are you as hungry as i am ?
what , you got the munchies ?
i could eat the whole
left side of the side street menu right now .
you got a contact high from miller &apos;s place .
i know this shirt i &apos;m wearing reeks of it .
oh , i guess that &apos;s good , right ?
means we &apos;ll fit right in at the smoke shop .
let &apos;s go .
here you go , commander .
all right , good .
you are aware that that &apos;s an orange box , right ?
yeah , they call it a black box , but they paint &apos; em orange
to help recovery teams like that find them more easily .
you check in with lori ?
yeah ,
max narrowed down the cod on jennsen .
she &apos;s gonna go over there with morrison and get the results .
hey , max .
oh , aloha .
do i know you ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
oh , yes . i @-@ i think we &apos;ve met before .
no . i think i would have remembered a guy like you .
well , i &apos;m rarely wrong about previous human encounters .
you are ...
jeff morrison .
it was my agent who was killed .
oh . i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
thank you .
so , max , you said on the phone you ... you got something for us ?
yes . i have positively identified
the killer of agent jennsen .
good . great .
who is it ?
right this way .
wow , max , you ... you fooled me .
i was certain there was a very tiny , tiny body under there .
well , technically , it is .
let me explain .
this is a body of a fully @-@ grown puffer fish .
highly poisonous , and according to my
chemical calculations , the origin of the substance
utilized by the murderer to kill the victim .
it looks harmless .
ah , looks can be very deceiving , agent morrison .
a small puffer fish like this
has enough toxin to kill 30 human beings .
a fish just like this was milked for its poison , and then
that poison was ingested orally by agent jennsen .
most likely with a hot beverage of some sort to disguise
the bitterness , like a coffee or tea .
none of this makes any sense , though .
who would have access to something like this ?
well , i really haven &apos;t thought about that .
spearfishermen would avoid them for obvious reasons .
and apart from a few select japanese chefs who are licensed
to serve the nonpoisonous part as a delicacy ,
i don &apos;t know .
good luck .
thanks , max .
so ... from what i hear ,
you &apos;re the guy to talk to about a little medicinal herb .
is that right ? who did you hear that from ?
from a guy named miller .
i burn fatties with him once a week .
he said even if i don &apos;t have my medical card ...
... brody would be able to hook me up .
look ... liam , he &apos;s a good customer ,
but he can &apos;t be telling everybody about this place .
we &apos;re trying to stay under the radar , know what i mean ?
i won &apos;t tell anyone .
just keep it a little secret between you and me .
you want to keep secrets with me , don &apos;t you ?
what &apos;s your name , girl ?
it &apos;s definitely not girl . it &apos;s officer kalakaua .
you &apos;re under arrest for sales to a police officer .
damn ! i knew you were a cop .
yeah , sure you did .
now , sales to an undercover is a hard case to beat , brody ,
but maybe if you help us , we can cut you some slack .
have you spoken to this woman before ?
i ain &apos;t speaking to you . you lied to me .
then talk to me . do you know that woman ?
i don &apos;t know her , and i ain &apos;t speaking to any cops .
i want my lawyer .
no problem .
but i &apos;m seizing the security footage from your back room .
and if the woman we &apos;re asking you about is on it ,
and you &apos;re lying to us , you &apos;re gonna be looking
at a lot more than a sales case .
walk !
i &apos;m not seeing her .
maybe brody was telling the truth .
okay , guys , i just got off the phone with fong .
he lifted a foreign print from the red book .
jason akita . he &apos;s a two @-@ striker .
greatest hits include burglary and narcotic sales .
hey . we &apos;re gonna need the data off this as soon as possible .
who &apos;s this guy ?
i &apos;ve seen him before .
there .
time stamp shows he was at the smoke shop three days ago .
that and the fact that his print was found on her red book
makes him a pretty damn good suspect .
exactly , and you said he &apos;s a two @-@ striker ?
that means one more felony pop and he goes away
for life without the possibility of parole .
you don &apos;t get a better motive for murder than that .
what part of &quot; don &apos;t move &quot; did he not understand , huh ?
stay on him .
lori , bag !
got it !
drop something ?
i got pills and powder .
hey , look at that .
let &apos;s go for a walk .
i don &apos;t know nothing about no murder , man .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m just a courier .
i take packages from point a to point b.
oh , yeah ? you &apos;re just an innocent drug mule , is that
what you &apos;re saying ?
oh , i ... i don &apos;t look at what they give me , brah .
i learned that from being a pizza delivery guy
on the north shore . if you don &apos;t know what &apos;s
inside the box , they can &apos;t blame you
for screwing up the order .
shut your mouth .
now listen to what i tell you , all right ?
you kill a cop on this island , we take it really personally .
so you should start talking to me now .
we know you were at her house .
we got your prints to prove it .
okay .
here &apos;s the deal . i &apos;m gonna
give it to you straight , brahs .
go ahead .
i broke in to that house
because i was working as an informant to ms. jennsen .
well , that makes zero sense .
it &apos;s the truth . as soon as i found out that she
was killed in that plane crash in the news , i remembered
that she had written my name down in that book of hers .
you were trying to get it back ?
exactly .
fellas , i can &apos;t walk these streets
if people find out i &apos;m a snitch .
so i broke in , and i took the pages with
the information that i had given her .
why didn &apos;t you just take the whole book ?
&apos;cause she was a nice lady , for a cop .
i didn &apos;t want to ruin the rest of the good work she was doing .
you said you gave her information-- what was that ?
she was tracing the stuff that was coming
from the customs house , so i gave her this area to watch .
it &apos;s where they would send me to pick up
packages that have bypassed customs .
you gave her ... did she follow up on that ?
i don &apos;t know .
where are the pages you tore out of the book ?
found it .
it &apos;s pretty toasted .
yeah .
why don &apos;t you run it over to fong ,
see if he can recover anything .
all right .
he has not stopped barking since danny left .
we get anything off the flight recorder ?
we &apos;re almost done compiling the data , but it &apos;s sort of hard
to focus with the dog barking .
he seems fine now , so ...
by the way , if you were thinking about going
in your office , i just , a little warning .
it &apos;s not a small dog , and ,
uh , i &apos;d watch my step .
he went in my office ?
yeah , land mines , all over the place .
danny ...
i &apos;m gonna take him for a walk .
come on , buddy .
what do we got ?
okay , this graph shows that three miles into the flight
the autopilot was engaged .
the fuel level was low at that time ,
which i &apos;m sure was intentional .
two miles after that , the pilot @-@ side door
was opened , causing an on @-@ dash alert .
okay ,
so it &apos;s exactly as i figured , right ?
the murderer flew the plane ,
he parachuted out , knowing the plane would run out of gas and crash .
the question is ,
where exactly did he exit the aircraft ?
well , i cross @-@ referenced the variables ,
such as fuel , opening of the door ,
flight timeline , and using that i came up
with a five @-@ mile radius where he might have
landed right in here .
the jungle &apos;s a bad place for a drop zone .
his parachute would &apos;ve got all tangled up
if his exit was in this area . so , lori ,
i want you to head down there with chin ,
see if you can pinpoint the exact drop zone .
okay , you got it .
wow , it &apos;s pretty dense down there .
steve &apos;s right--
whoever this guy is , if he bailed out over it ,
he &apos;s got to be a pretty experienced jumper .
wait .
i think i see something in the trees over there .
look like a parachute ?
got it .
looks like one of us is going for a climb .
sure you don &apos;t need any help recovering that evidence , sheena ?
i &apos;m good .
hey , lori . take a look at this .
you find something ?
yeah , motorcycle tracks .
this impression right here is from the center stand .
looks like our jumper
stashed the bike before the murder to make his getaway .
doesn &apos;t look like any tire tracks i &apos;ve seen before .
yeah , that &apos;s because
it &apos;s a specialty tire designed to fit an older bike .
an avon speedmaster , ribbed , to be exact .
and the center stand impression &apos;s
definitely from an older triumph .
you sure about that ?
yeah , 100 % . i own one .
&apos;68 bonneville . i &apos;ve been putting that baby together
for the past two years .
so , uh ,
how does that help us ?
well , it helps us
because finding spare parts on this island
for a bike like that is a pain , trust me .
there aren &apos;t many late @-@ model triumphs in hawaii .
okay . all right , i &apos;ll run a full dmv check
and put together a list of possible suspects .
i &apos;ll run these pages you found
through the video spectral comparator .
if there &apos;s any residue of ink left on the pages ,
it &apos;ll bring it up for us to read .
the pages were pretty burnt .
i &apos;d be surprised if ...
luckily for us ,
the pages are wax @-@ based and not loose @-@ leaf .
the wax base makes for a slower burn .
see here ?
says something about a suspect she &apos;s been following .
and now the words : &quot; stash pad . &quot;
yeah .
your victim was
on a narco investigation , right ?
yeah . uh , she was tracking a delivery ,
and this address might be where it landed .
if we could find the drugs , we might find the killer .
thanks , fong . you &apos;re a geek god .
i got about a dozen heat signatures ,
half of them ought to be people .
what are you thinking , guard dogs ?
no , too small for that , too .
all right , load and make ready .
we &apos;ll figure it out when we get in there .
five @-@ o , five @-@ o. show me your hands .
keep your hands where we can see &apos; em .
okay , uh ,
for the record , these people looked a lot scarier
as heat signatures .
who &apos;s in charge ?
i am . why are you pointing guns at us ?
i think you know why .
we &apos;re making flower leis .
nothing else .
you don &apos;t believe me ?
take a look around .
thank you , we will .
step back , ma &apos;am , step back , please .
there were more heat signatures back here .
danny , what do you see ?
i don &apos;t know .
excuse me , miss , do you have the key to this door ?
okay , what the hell is this ?
definitely not a drug ring .
modern @-@ day animal poaching is big business .
a billion @-@ dollar industry with
almost little or no attention paid by law enforcement .
why not , if it &apos;s such a big problem ?
we live in a post @-@ 9 / 11 world ; resources are limited .
this , uh ,
looks pretty tasty . what &apos;s this ?
this ... is bear bile .
bear bile ?
yeah , an adult bear
was milked half a dozen times , and then killed for this .
some people drink a bottle a day
&apos;cause they think it &apos;s good for their liver .
i wish she would &apos;ve told me she stumbled upon this .
probably had no idea the danger she was in .
i &apos;m sure she thought she had this handled .
yeah .
guys ,
looks like we found the source of our puffer fish poison .
oh , what &apos;d the nice lady have to say about that ?
nothing . she wanted to talk to a lawyer .
she &apos;s not gonna say anything--
there &apos;s too much risk , too much profit involved .
plus , i guarantee she has no control over
what &apos;s coming in and out of this place .
at least we know what kind of people we &apos;re dealing with , right ?
you guys know anyone else who might run in these circles ?
we might .
watch your tail . watch your tail .
come on . come on , come on , come on , come on .
oh ! what &apos;s up , brothers ? what &apos;s up with the canine ?
what &apos;s up with the canine ?
it is a victim &apos;s dog that we need to take to an animal shelter .
yes , we are , but the investigation
that we &apos;re currently working on keeps interfering .
i told you already , i &apos;m gonna deal with it
when i get a chance . thank you .
looks hungry , brah .
if you &apos;re gonna keep a pet , you got to feed him .
ah , see , no , it &apos;s not a pet , and we &apos;re not keeping him .
we @-@ we are not keeping him ? so you don &apos;t need to feed it .
i am a grown man-- i &apos;ve been
making my own decisions for a very long time .
but thank you . go ahead , go eat .
you want me to have one of my guys
take him to the shelter ?
enough with the dog , please !
enough with the dog , that &apos;s all i ask .
i &apos;m using manners . i said &quot; please . &quot;
okay ? thank you .
what we need to know from you is :
who around here poaches animals ?
okay ? specifically , the endangered type .
why are you asking me ? i sell shrimp ,
not baby seals .
kamekona , come on , you must know somebody .
heck , no . i &apos;ve seen fin @-@ less sharks wash ashore ,
found dead turtles on the reef ,
but i ... personally don &apos;t know
anybody poaches anything but eggs .
what are you doing here , max ?
kono told me that you guys would be here ,
and since i both needed to eat and drop this off to you ,
i figured it was a bit of fortuitous timing .
got a new car .
yes , i did , and thank you for noticing .
unfortunately , in order to purchase a sweet ride like this ,
it necessitated me to sell off
my entire prehistoric fossil collection
and my ds @-@ 9 action figures .
however , i feel it was very worth it .
i like it .
thank you .
i would like a shrimp @-@ flavored tofu special , please .
only thing special about that order--
no one but you orders it .
what do you got , max ?
the lab reports came in for the pills you found
in your suspect jason akita &apos;s duffel bag .
you &apos;ll be as surprised as i was when i found out
they were shark cartilage .
shark cartilage . is that even illegal ?
immoral , absolutely . illegal ... unfortunately not .
immoral or not ,
that stuff really works .
you got to go to chinatown ,
see one la &apos;au kanaka , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking for .
you just said five seconds ago that you don &apos;t know anybody .
you asked me if i knew any poachers .
that &apos;s like asking me if i know anybody that kills cows .
i don &apos;t .
and if you ask me for a restaurant that serves beef ,
i can point you in the right direction .
okay , kamekona , do you know la &apos;au kanaka ?
what &apos;s the statute of limitations ?
what are you talking about ?
you got immunity , okay ? now , talk !
all right . biggest one on the island-- name &apos;s dr. yang .
i used to go to him plenty when i used to train .
you gonna want black market supplements ,
you &apos;re gonna need to go see him .
did you say you were training ?
funny , huh , haole . funny .
nah , he &apos;s kidding .
he doesn &apos;t mean it . you got an address ?
yeah , boss .
what &apos;s wrong with your mutt ?
don &apos;t worry , he probably got a shrimp tail
stuck in his throat .
you gave him a shrimp tail ?
what the hell &apos;s the matter with you , feeding him shrimp tails ?
you wanted me to give him real shrimp at six bucks a pound ?
you &apos;re a neanderthal .
that &apos;s it , cough it up . buddy .
you &apos;re okay , get out of here .
too early to be closed , no ?
i think so .
did he just break in ?
he did . that &apos;s something he does regularly .
hello ?
five @-@ o. dr. yang , you here ?
just want to talk .
dr. yang ?
well , it looks like there was a hell of a fight in here .
that &apos;s a blood trail .
looks like the loser was dragged out the back door .
got a wallet .
too late . somebody grabbed the doctor .
for what ?
maybe our killer was tying up loose ends .
this does not make any sense .
all right , our killer , he goes to all this trouble
to make jennsen &apos;s death look like an accident .
if the guy who grabbed our doctor is our killer ,
why is he getting so sloppy all of a sudden ?
chin , you &apos;re on speaker . what do you got ?
so we ran the list of older triumph motorcycles
through the local dmv database .
it turns out that one of the registered owners
is a guy that we spoke to earlier today , liam miller .
that &apos;s the guy who sent you to the smoke shop .
mm @-@ hmm . and get this--
he &apos;s a pilot and he &apos;s jump @-@ qualified .
yeah , well , get this-- it says here in dr. yang &apos;s log ,
liam miller &apos;s being treated for pancreatic cancer .
let &apos;s go say hello to mr. miller .
clear . house is empty .
where the hell is this guy ?
mr. miller , this is angie , dr. mangold &apos;s nurse .
please call us as soon as you get this message .
it &apos;s about your lab results .
that sounds good .
get against the counter right now . right now .
where &apos;s dr. yang ?
where is he ?
dr. yang is in the process of learning
what it feels like to be helpless .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
where is he ?
he told me i was being cured , that the cancer
was behind me as long as i bought his damn medicine .
and when agent jennsen stumbled onto dr. yang ,
you killed her to keep him in business ?
and to keep yourself alive .
that doesn &apos;t matter now .
my oncologist told me the cancer has spread .
dr. yang lied to me ;
i &apos;m a dead man , just like her .
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
son of a bitch !
you killed her for nothing ! nothing !
i thought i was gonna die .
i never wanted it to come to that .
i tried to steer agent jennsen to the marijuana clinic ,
but she didn &apos;t care-- she just ...
wanted to stop the animal poaching .
she wouldn &apos;t leave it alone .
all right , if you actually feel remorse for murdering agent jennsen ...
you &apos;d do the right thing and tell us
where is dr. yang , where &apos;s he at ?
he &apos;s in there .
where &apos;s the key ?
i threw it away .
you threw it away ?
i wasn &apos;t planning on opening it back up .
hey ! he &apos;s alive .
danny , get a medivac helo in here right now .
this is detective danny williams . i need a medivac .
i &apos;ll text you my coordinates right now .
i was hoping that the chemo iv had already killed him .
all right , they &apos;re two out .
all right .
why don &apos;t you shoot me , agent morrison ?
i can see it in your eyes that you want to .
you hear me ?
okay .
i &apos;m a dead man anyway . go ahead .
draw your weapon .
shoot me .
come on , pull your weapon and shoot me .
you &apos;d be doing me a favor .
you &apos;re not getting off that easy .
hey . wait , wait .
no dog ? what , you finally took it to a shelter ?
no , i , uh , i gave the little pooch to grace ,
and rachel , of course , resisted at first ,
but then the dog won her over .
so score one for the single fathers of the world .
that &apos;s nice .
you do realize that technically it &apos;s not your dog to give away ?
ah , the dog needed a home ; i found it a home .
problem solved .
i didn &apos;t get a chance to thank you and your team
for the fine work that you did , and , um ...
i wanted you to see this .
agent jennsen was awarded the medal of valor ...
posthumously .
good .
she , uh ...
she made the ultimate sacrifice .
and i want you and your team to have it .
uh , no , we can &apos;t accept this .
yes ...
you can , and you will .
monica ...
monica would have wanted it that way .
mahalo nui loa .
