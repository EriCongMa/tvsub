that was liam .
the foster brother you told me about ?
he forced me to have sex with him .
you &apos;re so bossy sometimes .
it &apos;s kind of a turnoff .
bossy ?
emma . emma !
my girlfriend just broke up with me too .
well , that was dumb of her .
is jesus home ?
um ... no .
he isn &apos;t , i &apos;m sorry .
dear callie , my name is sophia .
and according to my dad , i &apos;m your sister .
if you don &apos;t want me to meet sophia , i won &apos;t .
if you want to , i think you should .
can we hang out again ? like , soon ?
yeah , no , i &apos;d like that .
when &apos;s the last time you spoke to jude ?
more specifically , when was the last time that he spoke to you ?
jude , talk to me .
sorry !
no , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;m just glad you weren &apos;t doing what i thought you were doing .
what did you think i was ... ?
ew ! no , i ... i don &apos;t do that .
ok .
morning .
do you ever get overwhelmed
knowing that you have to brush your teeth every morning
and every night for the rest of your life ?
hey , listen , everyone . we spoke to jude &apos;s therapist .
the good news is there &apos;s nothing physically wrong with him .
ok , so why isn &apos;t he talking ?
we &apos;re not really sure ,
but they think it &apos;s something called selective mutism .
it &apos;s a type of anxiety disorder .
so he &apos;s choosing not to talk ?
it &apos;s not as simple as that .
it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s more like it &apos;s a coping mechanism .
so what are we supposed to do then ?
we all have to be patient .
and do our best to keep his stress level down .
we &apos;re not gonna make a big deal out of his silence .
we &apos;re not gonna pressure him to talk .
and jude &apos;ll keep seeing his therapist .
a lot of good that &apos;s gonna do , if he &apos;s not talking .
there are a lot of different ways to communicate , callie .
like mama said , we &apos;ll just act like business as usual ...
hey , buddy . we , uh , just ...
so , uh ...
oh , um , i &apos;m probably gonna be late to dinner tonight .
we have extra practice all week .
i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll get that . just ... you guys expecting somebody ?
well , i &apos;m really proud of you , mariana .
you &apos;ve been working really hard .
thanks . apparently , i &apos;m working a little too hard .
kaitlyn says my smile is way too big ,
and i look like i &apos;m teaching zumba to toddlers at the y.
so i &apos;m shooting more for a medium smile .
is this a medium smile ?
sure .
yeah , i guess so .
callie .
there &apos;s someone at the door for you .
i know i should &apos;ve texted or something ,
but i couldn &apos;t wait to give you this , so ...
here .
you said you liked my jacket , so ...
you didn &apos;t have to ...
oh , i know . i wanted to .
how did you even know where i live ?
i saw your address on some of my dad &apos;s legal papers ,
and i asked marisol if we could drop by here on my way to school .
who &apos;s marisol ?
my nanny .
and now i &apos;m totally going to be late , so i gotta go .
do you like it ?
yeah .
yeah , of course . it &apos;s beautiful . thank you .
because it &apos;s fine , you can totally return it if you want .
no . no , no . i ... i love it .
ok .
marisol is literally going to kill me .
see you soon ?
yeah .
ok .
jude .
you should have seen sophia &apos;s face
when she dropped off that gift this morning .
she was so excited .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna tell her i can &apos;t see her anymore .
hold up , hold up .
why are you gonna do that ? because of jude ?
how do you even know that &apos;s what he wants ?
because i know my brother . and it &apos;s pretty obvious .
you two have been through a lot of bad stuff .
all right , you &apos;ve been jerked around ,
you &apos;ve never known where you were gonna live or for how long .
maybe not talking is his way of feeling like
he &apos;s finally in charge of something in his life . you know ?
or maybe i &apos;ve just scarred him for life
and he &apos;ll never speak again .
did , um ... didn &apos;t mariana tell you i came over last night ?
you did ?
i &apos;m sure she just forgot .
yeah , probably .
so ...
oh , it wasn &apos;t ...
i just wanted to say , when we talked at practice ...
i don &apos;t want you to think that i don &apos;t care .
i mean , i actually feel pretty awful
about how everything went down .
it was my fault . i never meant to hurt you .
i know . and i &apos;m sorry .
i ... i started feeling all weird and insecure .
i guess i just felt like that
you weren &apos;t really attracted to me .
that &apos;s not true at all .
but you &apos;re right , i &apos;m bossy .
no , i shouldn &apos;t have said it like that .
you &apos;re strong and you know what you want and you ask for it .
that &apos;s not a turnoff . not at all .
i was thinking ,
maybe it was a mistake , breaking up .
hey , connor .
hey . can you talk for a minute ?
of course , have a seat .
everything ok ?
um , no , not really .
i wanted to know , is there anything i can do to help jude ?
besides making sure the other kids don &apos;t make fun of him .
are they making fun of him ?
not in front of me .
not anymore .
well , thank you for that .
i appreciate you looking out for him , being such a good friend .
did something happen ?
my dad thinks jude is gay .
that &apos;s why i can &apos;t spend the night at your house anymore .
i see .
did he say that to jude ?
no . but i did .
you told jude you thought he was gay ?
no , i told him my dad did .
but i didn &apos;t stand up to him .
and i think that really hurt jude &apos;s feelings .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wish he &apos;d talk to me again .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s all right .
you &apos;re not your father .
jude knows that .
and he &apos;s gonna speak to you again .
you know , i think we all just need to give him some space
to figure out all the stuff he &apos;s feeling inside .
so , it &apos;s not my fault ?
no , sweetie . it &apos;s not .
hey . looking at your tax return ?
yeah . i wish .
so ... how &apos;s the pregnancy going ?
i remember the first trimester . ugh ! it can be a bear .
the nausea , the mood swings , the weight gain .
that was just me .
i see you still haven &apos;t taken off that baby weight yet .
ha ! just kidding .
you &apos;re looking good , mike . looking good .
thanks .
actually , i owe it all to dani .
she &apos;s got me doing yoga .
you ? really ?
yeah ! says it &apos;s good for stress relief .
i could use a little of that myself .
i &apos;m about to have six children .
oh , my god ! what were we thinking ?
come on , stef . anybody can manage that , it &apos;s you .
you and lena are unbelievable moms .
i &apos;m really happy for you guys .
thanks , mike . means a lot . it does .
you seeing brandon tonight ?
yeah , dani and i are gonna attempt to make empanadas .
so , um ,
you might wanna save some leftovers for brandon . just in case .
i may be doing yoga now ,
but i &apos;m still not really an optimist . i &apos;ll see you later .
that jane doe in the morgue you been asking about ?
yeah .
they finally got a cause of death .
blunt force trauma . they &apos;re ruling it a homicide .
you said you might know who she was ?
yeah .
you ever get those dental records you were waiting for ?
no . not yet .
oh , ok .
sure , it &apos;s no problem .
yeah , i &apos;ll tell him .
ok , fine .
yeah , we &apos;ll see you when you get here .
bye .
let me guess . he has to work late ?
yeah , he had a late arrest so he &apos;s got some paperwork to do .
i &apos;m gonna go .
why ?
dinner is ready , you should stay and eat .
if my dad &apos;s not coming , then there &apos;s no reason for me to stay .
you don &apos;t have to worry . it &apos;s not like something &apos;s gonna happen .
yeah . i know .
so sit down and have dinner .
how can you do this ?
do what ?
move in with my dad ,
sleep next to him every night knowing what we did .
i hate myself . i can barely look him in the eye .
first of all , your dad and i were broken up .
so that makes it ok then ?
no .
but i didn &apos;t cheat on him .
i was drunk .
you used me . you wanted to hurt your dad
for all of the times he hurt you .
you didn &apos;t screw me that night , you screwed him .
you are so full of ...
the truth ?
you know it and so will he .
so before you consider unburdening yourself of all this guilt ,
keep one thing in mind .
if your dad finds out ,
i &apos;m not the only one he &apos;ll never forgive .
i might have to figure out a way to live with myself ,
but i sure as hell don &apos;t have to have dinner with you .
why didn &apos;t you tell me emma came by last night ?
oh , i don &apos;t know , maybe because you were upstairs
shoving your tongue down hayley &apos;s throat ?
i wasn &apos;t ... she was ... look , this ...
this thing with hayley isn &apos;t serious .
you could have said no if you were still hung up on emma .
why do guys always act like
they don &apos;t have a choice if a girl wants to have sex ?
we don &apos;t !
ok , that &apos;s just ridiculous .
does emma want to get back together ?
is that why she came over here ?
maybe .
so what did you say ?
i told her we both need to take some time to think about it .
is that code for you need some time to dump hayley first ?
look , hayley is , like , super sensitive .
she just had her heart broken , and she &apos;s my friend .
she &apos;s kind of my only friend on the dance team .
look , i don &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
well , then don &apos;t .
be honest with them .
ok , i will .
ok , good .
as soon as i figure out what to say .
hey , sweetie . can i have a word with jude ?
uh , yeah , sure .
you do your homework ?
can you turn that off for a minute ?
so connor came to see me today .
he told me what his dad said .
at first , i was ... i was pretty angry at connor &apos;s dad ,
and i &apos;m not gonna lie , i &apos;m still kind of mad .
but , um , the truth is
there &apos;s nothing i can do about what he thinks .
the more i thought about it , though , um ,
i really just kind of feel bad for connor .
it must be hard ...
... to grow up with all that judgment around .
i want you to know
that i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re our son .
and there is nothing that you can &apos;t tell us .
even if it &apos;s something you think we don &apos;t want to hear .
ok ?
ok .
so ten more minutes and then it &apos;s off to bed .
how were the empanadas ?
uh , what ?
your dad said he and dani
were trying out some new recipe tonight .
oh , yeah . uh , dad had to work late so i didn &apos;t stay for dinner .
why didn &apos;t you stay and eat with dani ?
i hope you weren &apos;t rude . we raised you better than that .
didn &apos;t we ?
i wasn &apos;t rude . i just have a lot of homework .
i still do .
ok .
i just , i want to get this project done .
oh , uh , the band also has this place they rehearse sometimes ,
i think it &apos;s called the woodshed .
anyway , they wanna take me after school tomorrow . that cool ?
yeah , as long as your homework &apos;s finished .
it &apos;s fine with me .
ok . you hang in there .
i cannot wait for the supposed burst of energy
that comes with the second trimester .
i was just reading that that &apos;s a thing .
please tell me that &apos;s a thing .
that &apos;s a thing .
look , i &apos;m already showing .
oh . look at that .
what ?
i &apos;m afraid mike might have had something to do
with ana &apos;s disappearance .
what ? why would you even think that ?
i spoke to a witness at the halfway house where she was staying ,
and he said he saw mike yelling at her the night she disappeared .
stef , just because mike fell off the wagon and yelled at her ,
doesn &apos;t mean he hurt her .
i mean , she &apos;s a really easy person to yell at .
hell , i &apos;ve yelled at her sober .
i didn &apos;t tell you this , but when dani found mike ,
he had blood on his hands . he said he &apos;d been in a bar fight .
well , look , you don &apos;t even know
if ana &apos;s hurt or where she even is .
they , uh ...
they found a jane doe
that sort of vaguely fits ana &apos;s description ,
but they can &apos;t make a positive id .
so i tracked down her dental records ,
but i have not turned them over to the coroner ...
... because jane doe &apos;s death was ruled a homicide ,
and if it is ana , i could very well be linking mike to a murder .
oh , stef , come on . i mean ...
you know mike . i know mike .
i trust him implicitly . i trust him with our kids .
he &apos;s not capable of something like that .
mike would do anything to defend his family .
she was threatening us , lena , she was threatening all of us .
people ... you never know what they &apos;re capable of doing ,
trust me , especially given the right circumstances .
well , honey , i think that ...
... you have to turn over those records .
either way , you need to know the truth .
how much further ?
well , it depends how far you wanna go .
well , i thought we were going to , like , the woodshed .
the woodshed isn &apos;t really a place , it &apos;s more a ...
i don &apos;t know , a state of mind .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it &apos;s something jazz musicians used to do .
get away from your life for a little while , mix things up ,
get rid of distractions , really get into a piece of music .
i &apos;ve never heard of that before .
wait , did i just school mr. music on something ?
not bad for a high school dropout .
all right .
ok , so where do you wanna start ?
look at this view . you &apos;re missing it .
yeah . it &apos;s nice . what are we thinking ... ?
i mean it ! seriously , quit trying to force it .
can &apos;t we just be in the moment ?
these might help .
oh , no , thanks . i &apos;m not really a brownie guy .
uh , no , dude . these are special brownies .
it &apos;s up to you , man , but some of our best stuff
was written up here like this .
come on , give &quot; brooding brandon &quot; a day off .
yeah , to quote the great bob marley ,
《 don &apos;t worry , be happy 》
actually , it was bobby mcferrin who wrote that song .
yeah , marley died in &apos; 81
and that song came out in the late &apos; 80s .
it was actually the first a cappella song
to reach number one on the charts ,
which is pretty cool .
dude , trust me . you need this .
bad .
hey . hey , so , i ...
i was just thinking about you .
is there someplace you and i can go and talk ?
why ? are you breaking up with me ?
no , no !
but , to be honest with you ,
i didn &apos;t really think we were together , you know , officially .
of course we were together .
i wasn &apos;t hooking up with anyone else .
were you ?
no .
i feel like you get me .
even more than my friends .
like , you see the real me .
i &apos;ve been thinking ...
i think we should tell people .
do you think we can keep this on the dl just a little bit longer ?
i don &apos;t wanna hurt emma &apos;s feelings .
i mean , we just broke up .
i want give her some time to ...
i thought she broke up with you .
it &apos;s complicated .
she kind of wants to get back together .
i just don &apos;t want her to feel any worse .
is that cool ?
ok .
yeah , sure . i get it , no biggie .
we wait .
there &apos;s no me ...
without you .
you &apos;re the glue ...
in this zoo .
be my boo .
haters ! this is supposed to be a safe space .
ugh ! i can &apos;t believe how messed up i feel .
that was hella strong .
yeah , damn . me , too .
how you holding up , keys ?
what ?
how you holding up ?
here . have some water .
let &apos;s play a game .
i &apos;ll say a word and you say the first thing
that comes to your mind . ok ?
ok .
ocean .
salt .
sky .
clouds .
love .
don &apos;t think about it . love .
lust .
sex .
guilt .
you associate love with lust ,
but sex with guilt ?
interesting .
i gotta go to the bathroom .
i just , i &apos;ll be right ...
be back .
maybe ... maybe you should get ready for work .
i don &apos;t want you to be late .
i don &apos;t want to stop .
what about probation ?
you know what you said about me and jude
not having any control over our lives ?
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m tired of it .
i get to control this .
i love you .
and this is what i want .
you ok , buddy ?
下山了 正要回家 不
下山了 正要回家 不要担心 待会儿见
you ok ?
i can &apos;t ...
you don &apos;t have to ...
come here .
no , stop it ! stop !
what &apos;s wrong ?
sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t do this .
are you ok ?
not really . no .
i ate a pot brownie , and i &apos;m freaking out .
is that normal ? i don &apos;t feel normal . i feel nervous .
have you had pot before ? i feel like you haven &apos;t , which is smart .
but , you know , you guys told us to , uh ,
call if we ever need a ride home .
i shouldn &apos;t have called . i &apos;m sorry .
no , brandon , i &apos;m glad you did .
it &apos;s ok .
some people can get anxious or paranoid .
you never know how it &apos;s going to affect you .
it &apos;ll wear off , but until it does ,
i &apos;m here , ok ? so just breathe .
we &apos;re gonna get you through this .
ok . thank you .
you don &apos;t have to thank me .
i &apos;m your mom , this is what we do .
we made it official .
what ?
we &apos;re a couple .
jesus just wants to keep it under wraps for now
because he doesn &apos;t want to hurt emma .
guess she wants to get back together .
spoiler alert : not gonna happen .
i think it &apos;s really sweet of him to worry about her feelings .
but people talk . the news is gonna get out .
i just , i think it would be better if she heard it from a friend .
like who ?
like you .
me ?
you &apos;re friends , right ?
sort of . i mean , through jesus .
i would tell her myself , but i barely know her ,
so that would make me seem pretty awful .
ok , look .
i love my brother .
he &apos;s my twin and i would totally give him a kidney , anytime .
but when it comes to girls , he can be a little ...
all over the place . not in a bad way .
he &apos;s just not very good at expressing his true feelings .
if he even knows what he &apos;s feeling .
which , most of the time , he doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s easily confused .
are you saying he doesn &apos;t like me ?
no , he does . i think he does .
then what are you trying to say ?
do you not want me to date your brother ?
i thought we were friends .
we are !
and i am so stoked for you to date my brother .
i just ... i don &apos;t want you to get hurt .
that &apos;s sweet .
but the person you should be worried about is emma .
i mean , it &apos;s totally up to you if you want to tell her or not .
but i think it would be an awesome opportunity to do something nice .
girls have to stand up for each other , right ?
did i do something wrong ?
no . no .
can you tell me what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i just ...
no ... i don &apos;t really want to talk about it .
it &apos;s ok if you &apos;re not ready . i &apos;m not in any hurry .
no , i know .
thank you .
i &apos;m late .
callie , please look at me .
i love you .
i love you , too .
everything is fine .
i really don &apos;t know his schedule ,
since we &apos;re not partners anymore .
but you can find out , right ,
if he &apos;s working a double ? it can &apos;t be that hard .
what &apos;s this about , dani ?
he canceled dinner last night with brandon .
he wouldn &apos;t normally do that .
it &apos;s a dinner ...
it &apos;s not just a dinner . he leaves early , he comes home late .
i don &apos;t know what to think .
unless ...
unless he &apos;s drinking again ?
i haven &apos;t smelled anything on him ,
but i don &apos;t know , maybe he &apos;s getting high some other way .
what , mike ? drugs ? no . that &apos;s ...
maybe he &apos;s just having an affair .
he &apos;s not a cheater , dani .
i don &apos;t know what to tell you .
i hope you &apos;re right .
but if he is using or drinking again ,
it &apos;s something we &apos;re all going to have to deal with .
so if you won &apos;t check up on him for me , do it for brandon .
hey , did you ... did those records go over to the coroner yet ?
oh , yeah . the guy just left . why ?
nothing . never mind . thank you .
once i got to paris ,
i just knew i was going to be a different person
for the rest of my life .
the things that we do , the choices we make ,
they change us , you know ?
yeah . that &apos;s so cool .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re cars on a train .
well , not on a train , cars of a train .
they &apos;re all ... they &apos;re all in the right order
and they &apos;re all just going down the track ,
you gotta get them into the right station . you know ?
sure .
unless you pull into the wrong station ,
and then everything &apos;s just screwed up forever
because now you &apos;re in moscow and you wanna be in st. petersburg ,
and nobody wants to be in moscow ,
unless you &apos;re , like , raskolnikov ,
and you &apos;re trying to escape the anguish of what you did .
maybe we shouldn &apos;t talk about crime and punishment right now .
it &apos;s a little heavy .
but not . you know ?
i do .
girl , what &apos;d that table ever do to you ?
callie .
girl , where you at ?
sorry .
sit and spill .
you and wyatt get in a fight ?
no . not at all .
though he might think so .
why ?
i was gonna have sex with wyatt today for the first time .
i know it &apos;s a parole violation ,
but they can &apos;t tell me what to do with my own body .
i agree .
then why the face ?
i &apos;m just surprised .
because of brandon ?
no , i just figured you and wyatt were already doing it .
oh . uh , no .
no , and we didn &apos;t today either .
&apos;cause i kind of freaked out .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
all of a sudden , i ... i couldn &apos;t breathe .
and i felt like he was
gonna crush me or something .
maybe you were just nervous .
or maybe i &apos;m still in love with brandon .
i thought you were over him .
yeah , i thought so , too .
but maybe i &apos;m not .
i never felt like that when we were together .
were you ever with brandon ?
no .
no , not like that .
don &apos;t give up on wyatt .
he &apos;s a good one .
i &apos;m not . i &apos;m not .
we should get back to work .
mm @-@ hm .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
you all right ?
yeah , yeah . no , i &apos;m fine .
i just , i thought i saw someone i know .
brandon , why did you call me ?
i mean , i &apos;m glad that you did .
but , you know , you have other options .
well , jude and the twins can &apos;t drive . so ...
neither can callie , come to think of it .
and , i don &apos;t know , um ...
mom tends to overreact to things , and ...
i was just feeling so anxious , i couldn &apos;t imagine
dealing with her yelling , on top of it all .
she only yells at you because she loves you so much .
i know .
we both do . unconditionally .
honey , it &apos;s ok . you made a mistake .
tomorrow everything &apos;s gonna be back to normal .
no , things will ... never be normal again .
this is just part of growing up .
it &apos;s ok .
no . it &apos;s not .
i slept with dani .
dani ?
hey . heading out ?
i thought you were still pulling doubles .
luckily , no . i did my time .
good for you .
i gotta run .
i don &apos;t want to risk the wrath of dani by being late for date night .
i hear you . i &apos;m heading out , too . have a good night .
bye .
you told emma about hayley ?
you &apos;re welcome .
what , you think you were doing me a favor ?
yes .
emma &apos;s really upset . why would you want to hurt her like that ?
why would you ?
why would you tell hayley you were a couple , and not tell emma ?
so you could string her along in case you change your mind again ?
it &apos;s none of your business .
and whether you like it or not ,
your behavior , especially when it comes to girls on the dance team ,
affects me .
you wanna protect your little spot on the dance team ?
news flash : you &apos;re a terrible dancer .
well , you &apos;re a terrible brother and an even worse boyfriend .
you broke lexi &apos;s heart , and now emma &apos;s ,
and i &apos;m pretty sure hayley is next in line .
so , you know what ?
i &apos;m taking a stand for womankind . deal with it .
don &apos;t get all high and mighty .
this isn &apos;t about you taking a stand .
this is about you trying to be like all those other girls .
that &apos;s not true .
oh , please ,
have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately ?
if you wanna be a giant pain in my ass ,
at least admit why you &apos;re doing it .
&apos;cause you wanna fit in . &apos; cause you &apos;re a sheep !
what was all that slamming ?
your brother and sister .
i feel a lot better .
i &apos;m glad .
you can &apos;t tell anyone what happened with dani .
you have to promise me .
what dani did to you is not right .
it &apos;s illegal . and i can &apos;t ...
listen to me .
mom will kill her .
and dad might start drinking again ,
or who knows ?
please , don &apos;t tell anyone .
you can &apos;t ask me to do that .
please !
they &apos;ll never look at me the same way again .
can i join you ?
remember when we lived with that really mean kid
with the weird eyebrow , and he challenged us to play ?
we lost so bad .
and the next time we played ,
you figured out that thing , that thing at the end.you know ?
his character stopped fighting and did that , like , crazy dance .
it was hilarious .
we &apos;re a good team .
you &apos;re clearly the brains of the operation .
