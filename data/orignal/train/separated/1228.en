"A" hacked into the van's computer system
and took remote control of the vehicle.
There's something you need to know.
V_海斯汀_移动电话987
Getting a little tired of memorializing Mona.
Are you saying that the world's better off without her?
What the..
Mom!
We know about A.
This A killed my mom and Mona.
You're not Alison.
Every night the main generator shuts down like clockwork.
It takes exactly three minutes for the backup power to kick in.
That's the way out, but you have to climb up.
There's a steel door in the hall
and it's sealed like a vault.
The blocks in the playroom spelled out a name "Charles."
A is recreating a prom we already had?
What if we use the staircase
to make a grand entrance for Ali?
That's where the van is.
This is the old Campbell Farm.
We've searched the entire property,
there's no one here.
Then where is this place?
You should be standing up here, Charles.
Now.
'Let's go!'
Wanna say goodnight to your sister with a little kiss?
Is that you, Charles?
Spencer?
Spencer, where are you?
Hurry, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Go, go.
Come on ,guys!
Come on! Let's go!
Hurry!
Go!
Oh, my God.
We're still trapped.
We can climb it. Let's go.
Stop!
There's no way out.
I-I'm not going back down there.
You maybe a dude but you're still a bitch.
You guys, in the vault, I was so close to Charles
I could feel his breath.
Was there anything about him that you recognized?
A smell?
She's not Jenna.
I don't know, I can't pinpoint it
but there was something that was really familiar.
You mean like the way he moved?
No, it was..
Like when you meet a pen-pal or like a cousin
or somebody that you knew when you were really little.
So you're saying you think you know Charles a little
but you feel like you know him a lot?
I can't explain, it was just.. It was just a feeling.
It's gonna get cold out here tonight.
Where do you think we are?
We don't..
We don't know how long we were out before we got here, so...
We could be in the Amazon right now.
No, we are in the northern Hampshire.
That's the waning moon.
I was saying that "feciciously."
Well, that's even not a letter of word, Hanna.
Oh my God.
This fence is like a giant lagging rod.
You're gonna let us fried out here?
How long can a person live without food?
Three weeks.
But water's a different story.
Some people can only go a few days without it.
You know you're dying when you're not hungry
or thirsty anymore.
It means your organs are shutting down.
Mine are definitely working.
I'm so thirsty, I'm seriously considering drinking my own pee.
I can totally suck on a pee ice cube right now.
I'd lick sweat of a jockstrap.
Okay, Emily, you win.
I don't know how much longer I can handle this.
You can handle it, Aria.
We all can.
'Bonjour. Good morning. Buenos dias.'
'Please enter and follow the lighted pathway.'
I mean, I-I'm afraid to stay up here
but I'm also scared to death to go back there.
'Please enter and follow the lighted pathway.'
You've been here the longest, Mona.
What do we do?
Maybe this was our punishment.
Maybe it's not mad at us anymore.
Let's all stick together.
Always.
What the hell?
Mona! Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Hanna.
Is this a hospital?
Looks more like a morgue.
It feels like somebody's ripping my brain out
through my eye sockets.
What did they do to us?
Thank God.
What?
I thought for a second A harvested our organs.
Emily, we'd be dead.
You only need one kidney.
Hey, guys, I think A wanted to make us look dead
to send a message to our families.
What do you mean?
So they'd stop looking for us.
Aspirin? Juice?
Mona, what the hell is going on?
What happened to us?
I've asked not to call me that ever again, Hanna.
That bitch is dead to me.
Okay, Ali..
Ali, do you know what A did to us?
We're scared.
I'm scared too.
How long have we been here?
How long were we unconscious?
Only a few hours.
I've been in my room until now. That's all I know.
Are you sure that's all you know?
Please return to your rooms and find your surprises.
No.
Please return to your rooms and find your surprises.
I said, "No."
Three chimes means we have to go to our rooms.
Or else..
Ali.
Ali.
Ali, wait up. Please, talk to us.
Or else what?
It steals you in the night
and puts you in the hole.
Please return to your rooms and find your surprises.
I hate surprises.
Whatever the hole is I don't wanna go there.
No, no, no...
Oh, my God!
Please, no!
The four teen girls who were abducted
almost a month ago are still missing.
Today, their friend, Alison DiLaurentis
whose murder conviction was recently overturned
is about to address the public for the first time.
Police are reminding viewers to report any information
on Andrew Campbell's whereabouts.
The star athlete and honor roll student
remains the top suspect in the kidnapping case
and is presumed to be dangerous.
Excuse me, Alison, Alison, one question.
One month ago my friends were kidnapped
by a faceless, nameless coward.
And the same monster who attacked Mona Vanderwaal
and framed us for her murder.
We now know that Mona is alive.
But she is in grave danger.
As well as my friends.
I'm so thankful to be home with my family.
But I would do anything to see my friends again.
My friends have always been my rock.
Without them I'm lost in the woods.
Totally alone.
Andrew, if you're listening..
...please don't hurt them.
Please.
Thank you. That's all.
Do you really think Campbell did it?
Right now, I just need to be with my family.
Alone. No questions.
And please, no more police.
This better work.
Andrew's been obsessed with the girls
since Ali went missing.
If he really thinks that she's here alone
there is no way he'll pass up the opportunity to grab her.
And if you're wrong?
Dad, this was my idea.
If we don't poke the bear, it'll just keep hibernating.
I know. I just..
...don't like the idea of using my daughter as bait.
Your daughter will have police protection 24 hours a day.
We will leave nothing up to chance.
And if Andrew or anybody else tries to contact her
we'll be ready.
So what do we do now?
We wait.
And we hope that Andrew makes a move.
Mona, is that you?
Mona. Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Mona, come on. Please help us!
Mona!
Mona!
Do you need anything? Food, soda?
No. I'm fine.
Toby, what the hell?
Why didn't you come in the front?
Told me to be discreet, I came through the garage.
Everybody stay absolutely silent.
Hello?
Hello?
I know I'm the one that you really want.
Just tell me where you are and I'll find a way to get there.
But I have to know that you won't hurt them.
Did you get it?
The caller's in the house.
Do not open this door for anyone.
You stay down here.
First floor is clear.
Jason and Mr. DiLaurentis are with Hernandez.
Okay.
Show me your hands.
Let me see your hands.
Hello.
Why aren't you downstairs?
Where the hell is she?
Put out an APB.
Alison and Campbell should be on everyone's screensaver
from here to Lake Michigan.
What is it, Toby?
It's that song.
My mom used to play it on the piano.
It's called "Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree."
Call that in.
We got a...
Stop. Please. Someone tell us what the hell is goin' on.
That song was a message
about the Campbell Apple Farm.
Ali figured it out before we did.
And I think that she went there to meet Andrew without us.
It worked. They thought the call was from A.
Oh, it's Toby.
"Tanner sent everyone to the Campbell Apple Farm.
We're in the clear."
I don't know if I'd say that.
Me neither.
There's no other way.
As long as Tanner's around
A won't come near me with a ten-foot pole.
Are you even sure that Andrew even got the message
about the rock and being lost in the woods and...
Believe me, he'll be at the Kissing Rock.
He won't miss a chance to get his hands on me.
Ali, listen..
we're gonna be tracking you every step of the way.
And Toby will always know where we are.
Ali, those are for you.
Nice kicks.
Welcome home gift?
Actually inside is a tracking device.
It works like your phones GPS system.
It transports a signal to a satellite
and bounces back to us.
So wherever Andrew takes you
we'll only be a few seconds behind.
And if this works then you'll take us right to the girls.
Well, you know what they say
give the girl a good pair of shoes
and she can conquer the world, right?
Please proceed to Ali's room and prepare for arrival.
Please proceed to Ali's room and prepare for arrival.
Please proceed to Ali's room and prepare for arrival.
I'd ask if you were okay but..
let's not talk about what we just went through.
At least not until we get out of here.
I don't know if I could even find the words.
We're all together again.
Okay, it's gonna be okay.
Please proceed to Ali's room and prepare for arrival.
I don't wanna get in trouble again.
Let'just go.
Be careful.
This is all Ali's stuff from her room at home.
You guys, Ali's murder conviction was overturned.
迪劳伦提斯谋杀罪名被推翻
They're letting her go.
If that's even a real paper.
How did A get all this stuff?
You're seriously still asking how?
Yeah, Aria's right. Question down here is why.
Did A force you guys to sign the welcome card for Ali?
Oh, my God.
I think we're getting ready for Ali's arrival.
The real Ali, not Mona.
Oh, Ali. No.
What? What is it Spence?
"DiLaurentis was offered police protection
but declined citing the need to heal
privately with her family."
So Ali's a sitting duck.
If A brings Ali here
does that mean that he won't need Mona anymore?
So where is she?
Charles?
Is that you?
I'm sorry I upset you.
But if you let me out, I promise I'll be a good Ali.
The best you'll ever find.
Just give me a chance and you'll see.
No. No, no, no, don't go.
Don't go, please.
Charles? Charles.
No. Please, don't leave me here!
No. Please, please, don't leave me!
I can't believe Ali saved this.
This from the day we were at the lake.
Well, Ali was in rare form that day, remember?
She insulted everyone we'd ever met.
We let her call Lucas, Hermie.
We let her blind Jenna.
We are not the same people we were back then.
Including Ali.
Hey, Spence, can you come help me with this?
What? Help you with what?
The rod's just a little bit loose.
I don't know. Hanna, can you please do it?
She's busy.
What?
You see what I mean?
Oh, yeah, I see..
...remains the top suspect of the kidnapping case
and he's presumed to be dangerous.
The four teen girls who were abducted..
No one moves from that spot, you hear me?
No sign of Alison or Andrew at the Campbell Farm.
If you have any idea where she could be right now
you better tell me before it's too late.
Did you see that?
Look.
Behind the reporter.
There. The guy in the hat.
Speaking for the first time publicly..
That could be him. That could be Andrew.
Can you get a plate number?
Here we go.
Blue sedan with a partial plate.
1-8-0. That's the best we're gonna get.
I'll call it in.
Head North.
Then make an immediate left turn.
She's turning onto the highway. Northbound.
Hey, don't get too close, okay?
If we can see her, A can see us.
This better not be a colossal mistake.
If we loose Ali...
We're not loosing anyone.
Not Ali, not anyone.
I promised Hanna's mom I would get the girls back.
And I don't plan on breaking that promise.
You got a box too.
A is making this house our home.
You guys, Charles took our stuff
before he took us.
I thought that I lost this ages ago.
A planed on bringin' us here the whole time.
To live like his dolls.
This article is about our families.
All of them.
They barely hanging on to hope.
I don't wanna hear that.
Like you said that's probably not even real.
Well, real or not..
...they don't know where we are.
They don't even know if we're alive.
Can you just imagine what they're going though?
It plays in my head on a loop.
Day after day, night after night.
I will kill you for what you're doing to our families!
Do you hear me?
Aria, stop.
Calm down.
Not knowing that if we're okay
has made my mom physically sick.
They took her to the hospital.
Hanna..
Hanna..
Let's just all help Hanna unpack.
Hanna, I'm gonna help you unpack.
We're gonna find Mona and we're gonna get out of here tonight.
How?
Did you guys know that, um
I won an Etch A Sketch contest
when I was in the third grade?
Of course, you did.
I can draw some really, really pretty pictures.
The generator still shuts down with the switch-over.
I heard it too but I was too scared to leave my room.
See?
* Hush little baby don't say a word *
* Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird *
* And if that mockingbird don't sing *
* Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring *
* And if that diamond ring turns brass *
* Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass *
Your destination is on the right.
宾夕法尼亚州
You have reached your destination.
Roadside Assistance, may I help you?
Hi, my car has broken down. I need help.
What you need is in the trunk of the car.
What? What did you say?
I said, open the trunk of the car, Alison.
She's still not moving?
No, she's at a dead stop.
That's a poor choice of words.
Slow down. We don't wanna get too close.
This doesn't feel right.
You should call Toby.
We got a lead on Campbell's car.
A vehicle matching that description
was reported stolen two weeks ago.
We got the rest of the plate number
and we tracked it toll road.
Where?
Outside Tyler State Park.
Okay, let's go.
Where is she?
Ali's signal stopped here.
No, no, no.
'Put on the clothes and start walking.'
'Leave everything else behind or they die.'
Which way did she go?
Hey, she put 'em like this for a reason.
Let's go.
Hanna, let's go.
One, two, three..
four, five..
six, seven...
"Chandelier's rituals.
Sister launched lair. A ruler's list chained."
They're all anagrams.
For Charles DiLaurentis.
Some of those toys in Ali's room were hers
but some of them were his.
I feel like they grew up together.
If I'm right, everything that matters most
to Charles is in this vault.
If we get in, we can use
what's inside to bargain our way out.
But Mona said we won't make it
to the vault before the power comes on.
Okay, if I'm right, this is as far as we need to go.
I counted the steps to the vault from the prom room.
Of course you did.
It's 84.
And that's just one hallway over.
Coming back this way, it's 81 steps.
I think the vault is on the other side of this wall.
Yeah, but how does that help us?
We can't bust through there.
Charles disappeared like Houdini when Mona came into the room.
So there's gotta be like a secret passage way
or like a trapdoor or something.
Wait, do you guys hear that?
I think the generator is coming back on.
He knows that we're out.
Just help me move it.
Come on!
There's something behind this.
Come on, it could be like a passageway or something.
Come on!
Go.
A does have a soul.
'Wanna say goodnight to your sister..'
'and give a little kiss?
'What a good boy you are.'
Oh, good boys, good boys.
Game on, Charles.
We want Mona back!
Let's torch this place.
Oh, my God.
Guys, what if A is not watching us?
What if we're the only ones here?
What do we do? It's spreading too fast.
There's just no way I'm dying in this hell-hole.
We are not giving up.
Okay, we-we just need to find a blanket or something.
Here. Aria, help me pull this down.
Oh, my God.
I think he has set us on a wild goose chase.
Yeah, it wouldn't be the first time.
Guys, let's get outta here.
Oh, my God. Ohh!
Okay. Grab everything.
The pictures, the baby clothes and throw them in the fire.
Say goodbye to your soul.
Let's go. Let's go!
Let's go!
Go!
Do you hear that?
It's coming from underground.
Something is burning.
Hang on, hang on.
I see something. Guys, over here.
Call 911.
Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Mona, where are you?
Can you hear?
Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Mona!
Help me, please.
I'm down here. Help me, please.
Mona!
Mona!
I'm down here. Help me, please.
Mona!
Help me, please.
Oh, my God. Help me, please.
Oh, my God. Mona..
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Please get me out.
Mona, hang on.
Oh, my God.
We're gonna get you out of here.
Are you okay?
Mona, just hang on, okay?
We're gonna get you out.
Come on, it's this way.
Aria!
I got it. Hang on.
It's shut. Come on.
You're okay.
I thought I lost you.
Don't ever let me go.
Never.
Spencer?
Toby.
Oh, my God.
We know who it is. We have a name.
It's Andrew, babe.
And we're gonna get him.
Hey, there's another girl down here.
Miss? It's okay.
You're safe now.
What's your name?
Sarah.
I'm Sarah Harvey.
I met Sarah's friends, remember?
She lived in Courtland.
She went missin' around the same time Ali did.
Has she been down there that whole time?
Ezra told us what you did to save us.
Thank you.
