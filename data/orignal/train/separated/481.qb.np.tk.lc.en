hey ! hey , there &apos;s something over here .
oh , my god .
the bodies of two unidentified women
were found in the desert
just outside of the good doctor &apos;s hometown , las vegas .
they were stripped of their i.d.
one looks like she was killed yesterday ,
the other a couple of weeks ago .
according to the m.e. report ,
both women were in their 30s , and--
is this cause of death right ?
yes , and i have confirmed it .
both women drowned .
how far is the nearest body of water ?
the hoover dam , lake mead , like 60 miles .
so we &apos;re looking at a disposal site .
were they sexually assaulted ?
no , but they did both suffer blunt force trauma
and severe antemortem abrasions to the wrists and ankles .
that means they were most likely held somewhere
before they were killed .
or maybe they were bound
so they could be tortured with water .
she &apos;s right .
we can &apos;t rule out waterboarding
or being held underwater in a pool or a bathtub ,
it &apos;s possible this unsub &apos;s a sadist .
the woman killed yesterday was wearing a uniform .
she could have been a waitress or a maid .
there are 93 hotels in las vegas ,
260 motels and inns ,
1,510 bars , and 2,996 restaurants .
not to mention nearby summerlin ,
which is growing in popularity .
well , local p.d. has ruled out the major establishments .
they &apos;re combing through the smaller ones now
to see if they can find a match .
the other jane doe was pretty decomposed .
clothing looks ordinary .
is that a fanny pack she &apos;s wearing ?
yes , and it was empty .
it means she was probably a tourist , though .
last year las vegas
documented 39,727,022 visitors .
no other place has better surveillance software .
garcia , contact vegas p.d.
and ask them to start going through
hotel and casino surveillance video from 3 weeks ago ,
and tell them we &apos;ll be there in 4 hours . let &apos;s go .
yes , sir .
no ! get away from me .
help !
sir , please !
can you hear me , anybody ? !
somebody help me !
please ! help ! aah !
&quot; the secret of my influence
has always been that it remained secret . &quot;
salvador dali .
hi , mom , it &apos;s me again .
i &apos;m on a plane to las vegas ,
and i can &apos;t wait to see you .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
it &apos;s been a really long time
since i &apos;ve had chicken fried lobster ,
so i was hoping maybe when the case is done ,
we can go to binion &apos;s .
um , i have to go . call me back .
bye . love you .
the two women were brunettes in their 30s .
the unsub has a type .
if that &apos;s the case , were they targeted ,
or were they victims of opportunity ?
there &apos;s something strange about the disposal site .
it would seem like he took the bodies into the desert to hide them ,
but he chose a spot next to an old construction site
that &apos;s for sale .
he had to imagine that someone would show up eventually .
so was he hiding the bodies or displaying them ?
it could be both .
he might be hiding them from law enforcement
but displaying them to another group .
hello , american heroes . i just got an i.d.
on the most recently deceased victim ,
frida bancroft , 34 .
she was working as a waitress at della rose &apos;s grill downtown .
manager said she &apos;d been there for two months ,
and i just sent you a picture .
did she exhibit unusual behavior recently ,
or was she involved with anyone suspicious ?
well , the manager said he took a chance by hiring her
because she &apos;s a former drug addict with a spotty work history ,
and when she didn &apos;t show up to work for the last 3 days ,
he figured she had started using again .
but we know she didn &apos;t , because the m.e. report says
the tox screen was negative .
jj , you and reid go to the disposal site .
dave and morgan , go to the diner
and find out what you can about the waitress ,
and blake and i will go to the vegas p.d.
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s dead .
i was joking earlier that ed should just fire her .
oh , i feel awful .
don &apos;t . you didn &apos;t mean anything by it .
were there any recent changes in frida &apos;s life ?
no . other than signing a new apartment lease a week ago .
she &apos;d been saving up all the money she made here
for the last couple of months to pay for the security deposit .
it takes a lot of discipline to do that so quickly .
what about friends and family ?
was she in a relationship ?
she never talked about her past or her personal life .
it &apos;s almost like she wanted to wipe the slate clean .
ok , thanks .
thank you .
frida seemed determined to start a new life for herself ,
and we know she wasn &apos;t using .
she had to be hiding or running away from something .
i agree .
maybe she owed her dealer money
and was pulled back into the drug world .
the owners don &apos;t like it ,
but there &apos;s not much they can do about it .
bored teenagers party and drink here .
vagrants come out to collect empty beer bottles and cans .
so this location actually gets a lot of visitors .
more than you &apos;d expect in the middle of the desert .
it &apos;s probably because this is here .
people like to have a landmark to go to .
where exactly were the bodies found ?
the waitress was about 5 yards from the main sign .
the tourist was 200 yards that way .
this isn &apos;t completely dry .
there are drops of paint on the ground .
this was done recently .
whoever it was must have seen the body .
it &apos;d be hard to miss here .
it was probably some kid too scared to report it .
2 / 10 could be a tagger name or a gang sign .
does it look familiar to you ?
no .
2 out of 10 .
it &apos;s possible the unsub wrote this .
there were two victims here .
which means there could be 8 more .
he might be operating off a hit list .
you &apos;re not local . what are you doing in vegas ?
just looking for a girl .
my sister . she moved here a while ago
and no one &apos;s heard from her in a year .
what kind of trouble are you in ?
i &apos;m not . whoa , whoa , whoa--
don &apos;t lie to me , finn .
ok , ok .
what did you do ?
i got into a bar fight , ok ?
i beat up a guy pretty bad
and it turns out his brother was a cop .
i &apos;ll help you ,
but you gotta be truthful .
the one thing i can &apos;t abide are lies .
you &apos;re giving me tips on stealing
and you can &apos;t abide lies ?
this isn &apos;t about ethics .
it &apos;s about a relationship .
if i invite you into my world ,
it &apos;s because i trust you ,
and you can trust me .
honor among thieves ?
you got an innocent face .
that &apos;s worth a lot .
and you got grift sense . it just needs to be honed .
i &apos;m helping you because you can help me .
those are the terms .
hey , we &apos;ve been walking forever .
where is your place , anyway ?
right here .
toss me your bag .
you live down here ?
for now , until my plan works out .
how long you been here ?
a couple years .
most of these folks have been living here longer .
this is mary . terrific steer .
she chooses the targets .
gladys is the stall .
and olsen is a damn good wire .
the guy who actually lifts the goods .
so you all steal together .
sometimes .
home sweet home .
you can stay next door .
this was frida &apos;s place .
she moved out .
the doctor wanted this cleaned up .
actually , i was hoping my friend could use it ,
cesar . this is finn .
i &apos;m vouching for him .
ok , then .
welcome to paradise .
these tunnels used to be dangerous .
about a year ago ,
cesar cleaned up this whole section .
how ?
by establishing some much needed order .
why &apos;d you have to vouch for me ?
every good system needs its rules .
the first rule is , you don &apos;t join us
unless someone vouches for you .
he said the doctor wanted this cleaned up .
who &apos;s that ?
the doctor
is someone cesar works for .
no one &apos;s ever met him , though .
cesar &apos;s a little off , but we let him go
considering all the good he &apos;s done .
just don &apos;t cross him .
this is from 16 days ago .
you can see she &apos;s wearing the same clothing as the first victim .
yeah , it &apos;s definitely her .
casino i.d &apos;d her as renee sheffield of omaha .
she applied for a job 3 years ago as a hostess
but didn &apos;t make the cut .
there &apos;s no known address for her .
any i.d. on the boyfriend or husband who &apos;s with her ?
there &apos;s no hits on the facial recognition system .
does anyone at the casino
remember seeing or talking to them in person ?
good luck with that .
they get thousands of guests a week .
hold on . can you rewind that about 5 seconds ?
take a look at renee .
she &apos;s stealing .
she &apos;s a strip @-@ miner .
i can &apos;t believe i missed that .
strip @-@ miners take money or chips left behind
or unwatched by careless tourists .
they dress to look like tourists themselves
so that they &apos;re not spotted by casino security .
so the fanny pack is a prop .
how many strip @-@ miners are there ?
hard to say . hundreds at least .
there &apos;s no shortage of desperate people here .
a lot of grifters work in teams .
it &apos;s possible the man with her is just a partner .
maybe the partnership went bad and he killed her .
the dead waitress could be part of the team as well
if they all stole together .
we need to get an i.d. on the man .
please tell your team that &apos;s our top priority .
pay attention tonight .
i &apos;m gonna teach you a few things .
the first is called a pattern interrupt .
the brain has learned certain actions
like shaking hands or tying a shoe
as one single motion .
if you interrupt it in the middle ,
the brain can &apos;t pick up where it left off .
it &apos;s a moment where suggestion can enter .
as long as i &apos;m getting crap ...
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
my name is marvin caul .
many of you may know me as the master of deception
with the power of suggestion .
and what is your name , sir ?
bill .
bill .
hey , dale , check it out . i &apos;m getting hypnotized .
a pleasure to meet you , bill .
close your eyes and sleep .
focus on the sound of my voice .
when i snap my fingers ,
you &apos;re gonna open your eyes
and forget about the number 4 .
the number 4 will no longer exist .
can you see me , bill ?
yeah .
just to be sure , how many fingers am i holding up ?
count them for me .
1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 .
i don &apos;t get it .
it &apos;s ok , bill .
now , close your eyes again .
when i clap my hands ,
you &apos;re going to wake up
and everything will be back to normal .
what &apos;s going on ?
how many fingers ?
4 .
excellent .
you were terrific , bill .
ok , now , who &apos;s next ?
ladies and gentlemen , the one , the only , romeo ...
that was great , man .
that handshake thing , that was incredible .
she &apos;s amazing , right ?
yet , every day ,
we witness ...
the impossible .
romeo !
i can &apos;t believe that romeo &apos;s doing a private party .
my sister thinks he &apos;s a genius .
she applied for a job as his assistant .
he &apos;s a cocky little punk .
cesar worked security for him once .
he &apos;s no genius .
now , i &apos;ll need a volunteer .
he just got lucky .
ok , well , thank you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
my mom &apos;s not even here .
her psychiatrist said that she &apos;s doing really well
on some new medication ,
so she decided to go on a supervised field trip
to the grand canyon .
that &apos;s great .
isn &apos;t it ?
no , it is great . it &apos;s just--
i guess i kind of can &apos;t believe
that she didn &apos;t tell me about it , you know ?
this is someone that used to
literally write me a letter daily at one point .
i see .
you think she forgot about you ?
spence , you should be happy . this means she &apos;s getting better .
she &apos;s not constantly checking in .
you &apos;re right , i know .
grifters , hustlers , scammers--call them what you will .
this town has always been a mecca for con artists .
yeah , but nobody comes here
with the intent of being a strip @-@ miner .
it &apos;s just people with bigger dreams that didn &apos;t pan out .
hey , baby girl , what you got , mama ?
props to the federal b.i.
our next generation database is usually a miss ,
but today i got a big hit .
i &apos;ve i.d. &apos; d our mystery man .
his name is elijah hall , and 10 years ago
elijah served time in san diego
for assault and possession of pcp .
any connection to renee sheffield ?
no , not that i can see .
when did he move to las vegas ?
7 years ago . i don &apos;t have a current address yet ,
but fret not , my chickens , as soon as i do , i will hit you back .
do your thing .
frida kind of reminds me of my sister .
i wonder if romeo knows anything about carrie .
do you know how to get in touch with him ?
why would i be in contact with that fraud ?
ok .
sorry i asked .
frida sure left a lot of her personal stuff behind .
she didn &apos;t want any reminders of the tunnels .
it was temporary for her , just like it is for me .
i could blow all my money on rent
or i could save it up
like i &apos;m doing and use if for my plan .
what exactly is your plan ?
i &apos;m going to book a stage at the rio .
headliner performance .
once a real audience sees what i can do ,
i &apos;ll be famous .
i &apos;ll get past all the corporate cronies
who keep the genuine talent from getting out there .
what was that ?
i don &apos;t know .
cesar will take care of it .
if you &apos;d just admit you &apos;ve been hiding money ...
the doctor will be lenient .
i haven &apos;t .
i swear .
don &apos;t do this , cesar .
we &apos;re friends .
doctor .
it &apos;s you .
i know he &apos;s still alive ,
but i &apos;ve been waiting for--
i understand .
i &apos;ll kill him now .
no . no . uhh !
the abrasions on elijah &apos;s hands and ankles
are like the other victims .
this is a populated area .
we compromised his original disposal site ,
but this is a far cry from the desert .
it means the unsub &apos;s growing bolder .
he &apos;s certainly less concerned about concealing his crime .
look at this .
2 out of 10 again .
but this is the third victim that we know about ,
so it can &apos;t be about a hit list .
2 out of 10 isn &apos;t a countdown at all .
i think he might be referring to a hobo code .
from the great depression .
exactly . it means two eyes on 10 fingers
because thieves are present .
the code was devised during the great depression
by hobos to help each other out .
by placing the codes near the victims , who &apos;s being helped ?
no one . it &apos;s a threat .
if you steal , this is what will happen to you .
we &apos;re ready to give the profile .
we &apos;re looking for a sociopath
who is taking revenge on people he believes stole from him .
none of the victims had a documented address ,
so it &apos;s likely they were homeless .
they may have known each other from the street or from a shelter .
the disposal site of the first two victims served a dual purpose .
it was meant to hide the bodies from law enforcement
but at the same time put them on display for the people
that the message was intended for .
all of this suggests a group or organization at work ,
but it doesn &apos;t have the hallmarks of organized crime .
the victims seen on surveillance video
weren &apos;t stealing large sums of money ,
so we &apos;re dealing with a much smaller community .
but this group operates by a strict code ,
and any violation of that code can result in death .
you should be on the lookout for groups
that operate robberies and cons together .
the group has a strong leader who does not tolerate dissent .
this leader appears normal and comfortable in social situations .
he may even be extroverted and charismatic like a cult leader .
he &apos;ll have grandiose delusions and believe that he is special .
he may even believe that he can communicate with god
or some other higher powers .
he will attempt to surround himself with people who are subservient ,
either sycophantic followers
or people who are trapped by financial constraints .
how &apos;s he recruiting these people ?
it &apos;s likely he attracts followers by offering some assistance .
but as his power grows , so will his narcissism .
he &apos;ll begin to make increasingly extreme demands .
he &apos;ll want more attention ,
which could be why his latest victim
was found in a very public place .
with the choice of this latest disposal site ,
it indicates that he &apos;s growing bolder and more careless .
he has lost 3 followers . he &apos;s gonna need new recruits .
so we should step up patrols
in areas where the homeless population gathers .
thank you .
i used to have 10 , well , maybe 15 cats at one point .
now all i got is noodle . his mom was nipsey .
uh , have you seen marvin ?
marvin ? no , not since last night .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s tax day . i gotta go .
hmm . 45 .
very good , gladys .
i &apos;ll be sure and tell the doctor .
12 dollars .
is that it ?
yeah , that &apos;s all , cesar .
you sure about that ?
cesar , i swear .
because someone with the initials mary carter
told me you cleaned up at the luxor friday night .
oh , no , that &apos;s not true .
you know , i &apos;d really hate to tell the doctor about any of this .
you know how he gets .
you remember what happened to frida , renee , and elijah ?
that &apos;s because they tried to leave .
without paying their taxes . that makes them thieves .
but i sure do miss them .
here , take it all . go ahead .
doctor only wants his fair share .
who are you ?
uh , my name is sarah .
someone invite you ?
no . i &apos;m new .
i just need a place to stay for a while
until i can buy a bus ticket back home to minnesota .
can anyone vouch for you ?
look , if no one can vouch for you--
i can .
i know her .
all right .
tax day &apos;s over .
well , other than gender ,
one other thing &apos;s different about this victim .
these fresh abrasion marks on the neck .
strangulation ?
that &apos;s your cause of death .
no sign of drowning here .
drowning his victims was a unique signature .
why change it now ?
maybe he didn &apos;t have the time or means to drown him ,
or the unsub could be devolving .
the diatom results are back
on the water in the lungs of the first two victims .
this is interesting .
1,900 milligrams of lead , 320 milligrams of--
do you mind if i just take a peek at this ? it &apos;ll be quicker .
this isn &apos;t drinking water .
it &apos;s contaminated with ground pollutants .
it &apos;s like storm @-@ water runoff .
so the unsub killed him in a gutter ?
my guess would be the
floodwater control tunnels beneath the city .
thanks for saying you know me .
yeah , no problem . i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m new here , too .
so , who vouched for you ?
this guy marvin . he actually lives right there .
he &apos;s really cool . he &apos;s been , uh , helping me out .
so , what &apos;s up with cesar ?
is he some kind of enforcer ?
uh , i guess so .
he apparently is a little psycho , but i--
oh , hey , marvin . here you are .
i was wondering where you were .
who &apos;s your friend ?
oh , uh , this is sarah . she &apos;s new down here .
i &apos;m just here until i can get a bus ticket back home to minnesota .
you &apos;re rather put together
for a girl who needs a bus ticket back home to minnesota .
i was staying at a friend &apos;s apartment ,
but then i got kicked out .
well , that is unfortunate .
here , this is for you .
i found it in a used bookstore .
wow . this is fantastic . thanks , man .
marvin , he &apos;s a magician .
show her something .
well , let me think . um ...
if i may .
i could hypnotize her ,
but part of successful hypnosis is knowing who &apos;s susceptible .
people who can shut out reality .
who get sidetracked by a sunset .
who lose track of time , are good candidates .
those who aren &apos;t tend to be judgmental ,
fastidious , and ...
less trusting of others .
which i think describes sarah .
so perhaps i &apos;ll just
lift her watch instead .
there are at least 1,500 people
who live in the flood control tunnels .
it &apos;s a crossroads of the destitute--
ex @-@ cons , drug addicts , hard @-@ core gamblers .
plus there &apos;s always the threat
that the tunnels will flood like they did last week
when there was a flash thunderstorm in the desert .
we try to warn the residents to evacuate ,
but there isn &apos;t always time .
some of the tunnels will flood
when there &apos;s just a 15 @-@ minute storm up in the mountains .
so if the unsub knew about a coming storm ,
he could have just tied up the victims
and left them in the tunnel to drown .
then afterwards he just
took the bodies to the desert to dump them .
with the third victim , it hadn &apos;t rained in the last 24 hours ,
so he had to just strangle them .
frida bancroft was a former drug addict .
renee and elijah were both strip @-@ miners .
it &apos;s more than likely they were all residents underground .
so we need to start searching these tunnels .
that &apos;s the tricky part . there are 413 miles of them .
it &apos;s unbelievable . it &apos;s gonna make a great story .
ok . i gotta go . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
you going somewhere ?
oh ! you scared the bejesus out of me .
i was just heading out to go get some things
i left at the bus station in a locker .
anything i can do to help ?
no , i &apos;m good . thanks .
you &apos;ve all been very nice .
all right , then .
have a good night .
you , too .
based on where the victims were last seen alive ,
plus the most accessible locations in the tunnels ,
i &apos;ve narrowed down the two most likely sections they stayed in .
they &apos;re 22 miles apart .
just got a call about a missing person .
a journalist for the &quot; las vegas chronicle &quot;
by the name of sarah renfield .
do you think this is connected to our case ?
she &apos;s been working on a story
about the homeless people in the tunnels .
has anyone tried tracking her cell phone ?
it was found in a dumpster
on beekman street on the south side of town .
that &apos;s right here . nearest tunnel access point is c @-@ 16 .
that &apos;s 30 miles from our other locations .
all right , we should split up .
what &apos;d you find , garcia ?
could someone let the pope know about me ,
because what i do is kind of a miracle .
i recovered a text from renee sheffield &apos;s cell phone
sent 6 months ago before her service was cut off .
it reads , &quot; met e in tunnel . great guy .
planning to leave together soon . &quot;
any chance &quot; e &quot; stands for elijah hall ?
in my limited research about the tunnels ,
it appears that people meet and fall in love there .
i &apos;ve heard about entire families that live down there .
so in addition of being accused of stealing ,
it seems all 3 victims wanted to move out of the tunnels .
well , frida the waitress had just left .
if renee and elijah were about to do the same ,
that could have triggered the unsub &apos;s rage .
you can &apos;t have a cult if everyone tries to leave .
who knew living in the tunnels came at such a high price ?
hey , have you seen sarah ?
the , the new girl ?
ok , thanks .
sarah !
sarah ?
sarah !
hey . i was looking for sarah , and i--
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
what happened to her ?
she &apos;s a reporter . she was gonna write about us ,
which would not be a good thing .
so you killed her ?
she &apos;s not dead .
yet .
back away !
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
he &apos;s crazy , man .
she &apos;s a reporter .
he hurt sarah .
the water &apos;s over the bridge !
what does that even mean ? !
the doctor knows !
can we all just calm down ?
everyone wants to do what &apos;s best .
since finn vouched for her ,
perhaps he should be the one to handle this .
we &apos;re at a locked entrance .
no one &apos;s been here in a long time .
copy that .
remind me to call my shoemaker .
i &apos;m gonna need a new pair of boots .
you have a shoemaker ?
well , one thing i &apos;ve learned in life--
a good pair of shoes can last longer than a marriage .
you only have to pay for them once .
sir , we &apos;re with the fbi .
we &apos;re looking for information on these people .
do you recognize any of them ?
no , i don &apos;t .
are you afraid of something ?
whoever it is , we &apos;ll protect you .
cesar &apos;s a very bad man .
where can we find him ?
fbi ! just want to talk .
go ! go , go , go !
jj , go left .
drop it !
keep your hands where i can see them
and get down on your knees .
where is sarah ?
the police are still looking , but there &apos;s no sign of her .
cesar , we have a witness
who says you killed these people .
did you murder sarah , too ?
the water &apos;s over the bridge .
what does that mean ?
the doctor knows .
is that someone who lives in the tunnels , too ?
he &apos;s more than someone .
dr. aja mesbi is a magic man .
magic man ?
yeah , he &apos;s like a sorcerer .
he &apos;s got powers .
what sort of powers ?
he controls words ,
thoughts .
he can do whatever--
he can do whatever he wants in you just by thinking it .
if he &apos;s not delusional and this is an act ,
he &apos;s quite good .
the water is over the bridge .
it could be the opposite of water under the bridge .
it would mean something &apos;s not forgiven ,
which is consistent with revenge as a motive .
the drowning of the first two victims
could be symbolic of that . go ahead , garcia .
coming at you with the skinny on cesar jones .
he &apos;s an ex @-@ con who served time 8 years ago for armed robbery .
according to prison incident reports ,
he is known for his volatile temper and extreme brutality .
any history of mental illness ?
any psychotic or delusional disorders ?
i am not finding it . i think he &apos;s just an angry person .
ok . thanks .
i don &apos;t think cesar could have pulled off all these murders
or the kidnapping of the reporter .
it would take patience , planning , and organization .
he doesn &apos;t have the concentration skill set .
&quot; pay no attention to the man behind the curtain . &quot;
&quot; the wizard of oz &quot; ?
the doctor could be real .
cesar would be the kind of person
vulnerable to manipulation .
and dr. aja mesbi--
that &apos;s an odd name .
it sounds vaguely african or indian .
or made up .
it &apos;s an anagram ,
for james braid .
he was a scottish surgeon in the 1800s ,
considered to be the father of hypnosis .
let me try something .
cesar &apos;s a lunatic .
i &apos;m pretty sure he killed frida
and some other people , too .
where are we ?
aboveground , like you wanted .
yeah , but we &apos;re in the middle of the desert .
we were supposed to bring her to the hospital .
it &apos;s easy to get lost in the tunnels .
cesar , hi .
my name is dr. spencer reid ,
and i &apos;m an fbi agent .
but , really , i work for dr. mesbi .
he sent me here to help you .
how do i know you &apos;re telling the truth ?
i &apos;ll turn the camera off .
i think you know the doctor &apos;s very powerful ,
and you can imagine he has many people in many places to help him .
do you believe that ?
finn , i know you care about this girl .
you &apos;re smart and you &apos;re able to think ahead ,
so you can imagine what will happen
when she wakes up , tied up , with us here .
she &apos;ll think we did it .
no , no , we &apos;ll explain to her how we rescued her--
and she won &apos;t believe it .
no one would .
play it out .
i don &apos;t know , man .
if she goes to the police ,
all of us in the tunnels will be arrested , including you .
she will ruin a very good thing
for a lot of people .
what am i supposed to do ?
you already know the answer , finn .
she cannot live .
you have to kill her .
the doctor values you , cesar .
he trusts you , and you know that .
you &apos;re very important and we need to get you out of here ,
but in order for me to help you ,
i need to know about the last conversation you had with the doctor .
i can &apos;t remember it .
i &apos;m going to help you try to remember , ok ?
do me a favor and close your eyes .
imagine you &apos;re back in the tunnels .
it &apos;s chilly . the air smells damp .
do you see anything ?
don &apos;t do this .
i see elijah .
he &apos;s begging for his life .
i hear the doctor and i go to him .
doctor .
what happens next ?
he &apos;s--
i &apos;ll kill him now .
the reporter &apos;s still alive .
the doctor &apos;s real name is marvin caul .
he and someone named finn bailey
took her into one of the tunnels heading into the desert .
how &apos;d you get him to talk ?
neuro @-@ linguistic programming . i used sensory predicates
and key words to tap into his unconscious mind .
marvin caul must have done the exact same thing .
you &apos;ve lost me .
nlp is a way of thinking and communicating
based on linguistic modeling .
for example , key words like know and imagine
open someone up to suggestion .
it &apos;s behind a lot of persuasion and sales techniques .
there are two different exits into the desert .
one on the north end and the other &apos;s on the west .
all right , let &apos;s go .
what have you got , garcia ?
marvin caul , known as the master of deception .
he &apos;s a low @-@ level entertainer who performs at private parties .
he hasn &apos;t filed a tax return in 5 years .
the irs is after him .
no known address . he does have a p.o. box .
no tax returns ?
he &apos;s either not doing so well
or doing really well .
i &apos;d guess the former .
someone who feels trivial in the regular world
would look for power elsewhere .
well , the homeless would be
an easy population for him to exploit
and give him a sense of importance .
what did you find out about finn bailey ?
finn bailey , 26 . he was picked up in reno
two months ago for shoplifting .
according to the police reports , he was on his way to vegas
to look for his sister carrie .
she was about to start a job with a magician named romeo ,
but the day before she was supposed to start ,
she called her brother ,
sounding scared and babbling about some doctor .
that was the last he heard from her .
did the reno police follow up ?
no , because there was no proof that carrie was actually missing .
well , we know marvin &apos;s enraged by people trying to leave .
what if carrie was the original trigger ?
that means she &apos;s probably dead .
you know what has to be done , finn .
where did you get that ?
i stole it from the cab of a semi last month .
before i do this , i want to know something .
the whole time i was in the tunnel ,
you &apos;re the only one that didn &apos;t seem scared of cesar .
and you were gone on tax day .
what &apos;s this about , finn ?
my sister told me all about you .
how you liked to eat at della rosa &apos;s grill ,
how you met her there and brought her down to the tunnels .
you killed her , didn &apos;t you ? !
she said if anything ever happened to her ,
the doctor was responsible .
you &apos;re the doctor , aren &apos;t you ?
fbi ! drop your weapon !
not until he tells me what he did to my sister .
you &apos;re mistaken , finn . i never met her .
liar !
put the gun down !
he told me to kill sarah , too .
the boy &apos;s quite mad .
finn , let us go to sarah .
she needs our help . will you let us do that ?
copy that .
the police just confirmed your sister &apos;s dead , finn . i &apos;m sorry .
because he killed her .
she was found in a crack den .
she died of an overdose .
no , no , no .
he convinced her to do it . he &apos;s very persuasive .
it was in phoenix , finn .
this man had nothing to do with it .
you have the wrong guy .
put the gun down .
there &apos;s no point to this .
thank god you showed up .
marvin caul , can i just that say i &apos;m a huge fan .
i saw you perform at the lotus inn back in 1977
when i was a little kid
and i always wondered what happened to you .
time .
time has not been kind .
here , let me give you a ride back to the station .
i can &apos;t imagine how hard it must have been
for someone of your talent to stay hidden for so long .
i mean , weren &apos;t you dying to get back out there ?
of course . and i have a plan .
i am going to book a stage at the rio .
so , that &apos;s what the money was for .
you know , i have to say , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant .
you found the perfect population to steal from
and someone else to do your dirty work .
i tip my hat to you .
i have no idea what you &apos;re saying .
what i &apos;m saying is that you &apos;re going to be charged with murder ,
and the first one will be carrie &apos;s .
i &apos;m assuming you killed her
because your ego got in the way
when she left you to work for another magician .
am i right ?
look , marvin , there &apos;s noplace to go .
you &apos;re a very clever man and you know how to read a situation .
tell me where carrie &apos;s body is
and at least you &apos;ll get recognition
for what you accomplished in the tunnels .
she &apos;s buried at the abandoned construction site .
did you really see me at the lotus inn ?
the truth ?
i can &apos;t abide lies .
i wasn &apos;t even born yet .
&quot; illusion is needed to disguise the emptiness within . &quot;
arthur erickson .
i &apos;m sorry you didn &apos;t get to see your mom .
it &apos;s ok . i guess now i know
what a parent feels like when their kid grows up .
someone who &apos;s depended on you for so long
and then suddenly they &apos;re off living their own life
and they don &apos;t really need you anymore .
except she &apos;s the parent , and that &apos;s how it should be .
oh , hi . welcome back .
this came for you .
no return address ?
yeah , and it &apos;s really heavy . so what &apos;s inside it ?
yes , that &apos;s me being nosy .
that looks like a pile of --
shale , limestone , and sandstone .
it &apos;s a sculpture of the grand canyon from my mom .
see ? she didn &apos;t forget you .
she said she was gonna mail the postcards ,
but then she decided to send the grand canyon instead .
here , listen to this .
&quot; you many have to commit me twice , spencer ,
because not only did i ride a mule on a tiny trail
with a 1,000 @-@ foot vertical drop ,
i paid for the privilege .
now , that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
can you imagine my mom on a mule ?
no .
it &apos;s like hotch at the beach .
