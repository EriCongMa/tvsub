Who are you?
I'm Marco Reyes.
When your brother disappeared,
he was in possession of a significant amount of my money.
$18.5 million.
You have until Monday to bring my money to this address.
What happens if I don't bring you the money?
You'll get a package with your brother's head in it.
Reyes said that Matty owed him $18.5 million.
You see, this is only $13 million.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am positive. I counted it three times.
And now I am, uh, $5.5 million short,
and I have two days to come up with all of it,
or, um, my brother's dead.
I really don't see any other ways.
I may have one.
Maybe we can do a little quid pro quo.
Tell me what you want.
Immediate transfer to the special holding unit
at the high-security facility.
There I'll get a private cell,
and for that I am willing to pay... - $5.5 million.
This is gonna cost you
in ways that you could not possibly predict.
It's all there, okay?
Just, uh, let me see my brother now.
Hey, Matty. Matty.
Look at me, look at me.
Nice.
Nice hands, man.
Awesome hands.
Let's see your arm.
Sorry.
Don't worry about it-- come here.
See the laces?
The laces are there for a reason, right?
Yeah.
Use them.
Show me.
Find the grooves,
find the grooves.
Keep this loose.
Okay.
All right?
Tight.
Let it roll through.
That's right.
That's right, nice.
You feel that?
Yeah.
Now you feel the difference?
Right?
Joe.
Steve, where's Danny?
He's at Grace's school for career day. Why?
Get him out of there now.
Why? What's going on?
There's no time to explain--
just get him out of there.
We got to go.
Come on.
So like, uh, like I said,
our job is to uphold the laws of this great country.
Without policemen, without policewomen,
uh, there'd be no order.
And order is, um...
it's the backbone to any civilized society.
And, yes, I like doughnuts very much.
If anybody has any questions,
uh, please, you can ask them now.
Yes.
What's it like cutting up dead people?
I don't do that.
I was asking him.
The vivisection of a once-living organism
as a scientific necessity can be quite rewarding
if it yields forensic results.
Is it yucky?
Quite the opposite.
Thank you for asking.
Okay, anybody else?
Who else?
Yes.
You ever find anything weird in the poop chute?
Settle down.
Young man,
if you're referring to the anus
or the descending colon,
then the answer is yes.
Sometimes, foreign objects can be found...
Okay. Okay, Max, that's good.
Oh, thank you for asking.
Uh, anybody have any police-related questions?
Yeah.
How old do you have to be
to join the police academy?
Uh, well, that's not a relevant question
for someone who's gonna be a marine biologist,
so we'll move on.
Anybody else?
Detective Daniel Williams?
Yeah.
My name's Deputy Knox, U.S. Marshals.
Can you please place your hands behind your back?
Sure. What's this, uh,
what's this about?
You're under arrest for murder.
You can't do this.
Sir, please step back.
For murder? What are you talking about?
All right, let's go.
All right, ho-ho-ho...
Grace, it's all right.
Listen, I'm gonna get this figured out.
I'll see you at home, okay?
Everything's fine.
Hey, easy, easy.
They give you any other details?
No, Max said they just, they walked right in,
th-they cuffed him, and they hauled him away.
Who's got Grace?
Max is gonna take her to Rachel's place.
All right, I'm out the door.
I'll meet you at the Federal Detention Center in ten.
What's your rush, Lieutenant?
Coughlin.
I don't know what you want,
but now is not the time.
Unfortunately for you, it is.
Grab some hood.
What? You're arresting me? Right now?
You got to be kidding.
What's it for this time?
Bribery, tax evasion,
criminal misconduct,
and my favorite,
conspiracy to commit murder.
Told you I'd catch you later.
Excuse me.
I need to see, uh,
Detective Daniel Williams.
He was just brought in here.
I'm sorry, the prisoner is being processed.
And there's no visitors.
All right, look,
I'm Five-O, all right.
Make an exception, please.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
Uh, I want to speak to the watch commander.
He's gonna tell you the same thing-- no visitors.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, Chin, listen, I'm here.
There's no way they're gonna let us see Danny.
Yo, man, where are you?
Call me, all right?
Call me when you get this.
Joe, what's going on?
Not here. Get in.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Thank you, Sir.
Detective Williams,
my name is Sam Alexander,
and I'm from the State Department.
Oh, you're a... you're a spook.
You should just say,
"Hi, Detective Williams.
I'm a spook."
You are going to be extradited to Colombia.
And there you will stand trial for the murder of Marco Reyes.
Yeah, that's right.
Don't say anything.
Just save it for your lawyer.
But y-you should know
that the Colombians have evidence
that puts you in the room with Reyes
at the time of death.
And, of course, there's also motive,
which is that you killed Reyes
because he murdered your brother.
Notice to waive extradition.
Waive ex...
Why would I sign that?
Because you're guilty.
And we both know that.
Okay, you know what, Joe, help me understand.
Why would the CIA care about getting justice
for a drug-dealing scumbag like Marco Reyes?
'Cause he's more than just a drug-dealing scumbag, Steve.
What are you talking about?
Marco Reyes was an Agency asset.
Our government invested a lot in him,
and they don't care who Danny is;
they just want somebody to pay for the murder.
Turn to your right.
Reyes was helping the CIA with an operation called "Sandpiper."
Where'd you get all this?
Don't ask.
Here's how it worked.
Wall Street invested in the expanding housing market in Colombia.
What they didn't realize was they were actually buying
into a cocaine cartel's laundering scheme.
When the Colombian government
made a stronger push toward drug enforcement,
U.S. banks, all of a sudden,
started taking huge hits.
Indirectly affecting the stability of our economy.
So the CIA felt they had no choice but to step in,
keep the drugs flowing to prevent a potential market crash.
And Marco Reyes was moving the coke.
That's right.
He's been on their books for years.
CIA had him under surveillance,
which is how they knew that Danny pulled the trigger.
And that you were there to witness it.
All right, so they also knew that Reyes killed Danny's brother.
Do you think they care about that?
Matthew Williams was a fugitive wanted by the FBI
for fraud, money laundering, criminal conspiracy.
As far as the CIA's concerned,
his murder was the cost of doing business.
All right, fine, but, joe, you just said it--
they knew I was there, too, right?
With Danny, in Colombia.
Why wasn't I picked up, too?
Steve, you're a highly-decorated Navy SEAL.
A hero.
I'm guessing you get a free pass.
Steve, I just got a call from Duke.
Chin's been arrested by Detective Coughlin.
What?
Who's Coughlin?
He runs Internal Affairs for HPD.
And he's been after Chin's scalp for the better part of a year.
First Danny, now Chin.
That can't be a coincidence.
Wait a minute, did Duke say that
he thinks Coughlin has something,
or is this just another one of his shakedowns?
He said Coughlin wouldn't have booked Chin
unless he had something that was rock solid.
So, tax evasion, huh?
At least, that's a new one.
Don't knock it.
That's what took down Capone.
Only you're no Capone, Mr. Kelly.
That's Lieutenant Kelly to you.
Not after today.
You are done being a cop.
From here, you're going to a cell, the courtroom,
then a concrete box for 20 years.
Whatever you think you have on me, it's not gonna stick.
I'll be out of here on bail soon enough.
"Bail"? There's not gonna be any bail.
You're a flight risk.
Given that the $5.5 million your brother-in-law gave you
is still unaccounted for.
What? You didn't think we were gonna find out about that?
Your name's all over the Halawa visitor's log,
and don't tell me Waincroft's helping you out
with an investigation because I looked into that as well.
Mr. Kelly, you went to him for money.
And in exchange,
he was offered a private cell in the country club wing.
Well, then you should know that that's only half the story.
A man named Marco Reyes
took Danny Williams' brother.
I borrowed that money to help pay for that man's ransom.
And you didn't shave a little off the top?
Every penny went to the ransom.
Mr. Kelly...
there's a lot of conflicting evidence regarding Mr. Reyes.
You're here being charged with helping facilitate his murder.
So you can understand why I'm a little skeptical.
It's not about what you think.
It's the truth.
But then again, you were never really interested in the truth,
were you?
All you want is to see me behind bars.
That's where you belong, Mr. Kelly.
You took drug money from a cop killer.
No matter how it was used, that's still a crime.
A friend thought his brother was going to be murdered.
I did what I could to help save that man's life.
Detective Williams must be some kind of friend
if you're willing to throw away your career and freedom for him.
I mean, I don't know anyone who would do that for me.
What? Is something funny?
Just the thought of you having friends.
Your friend killed a man, and you aided and abetted.
So I'm thinking the only one who should be smiling here
is me.
I just came from Halawa.
Gabriel Waincroft isn't there.
Where is he?
I don't know.
But I think Coughlin took him
and stashed him somewhere as a preemptive strike.
Coughlin's no dummy.
He probably figured we'd go to Halawa
to see what Waincroft told IA.
Okay, we're gonna have to assume
that Gabriel didn't tell Coughlin
what Chin was using the money for.
Well, this bum's been in the system most of his life.
He knows the game.
He's holding onto the information.
Withholding the truth to maybe make a another deal
in case Coughlin doesn't bite.
Okay, Gabriel knows that my cousin's an easy target.
If he told IA that Chin took the money for himself,
Coughlin's going to make sure
he loses his badge and for good.
18 and a half million dollars.
I have to imagine that was pretty heavy.
We got you with the bags coming and going, Detective, so
where's the money?
The money, uh, would be right where we left it.
Uh, St. Joseph's casa de los niños.
An orphanage?
You must really love kids
to leave them that kind of cash, huh?
I mean...
you offed a guy and...
you and your accomplice, you could've just, uh,
you could've just retired on that.
You're from Boston?
Patriots.
Bruins and Red Sox.
But that's hardly relevant.
Right, no, I'm just,
I'm just trying to figure out
why a guy who grew up
300 miles away from me
cares so much about a scumbag drug-dealing murderer,
uh, from South America.
I care about the law.
And you broke it.
It's really that simple.
Marco Reyes cut my brother up into pieces
and put him in an oil drum.
And you murdered him in cold blood.
You know, you know, mr. Reyes had a family.
Two young boys.
Just about the same age as your daughter.
Did you know that?
You took the law in your own hands, Detective.
Out of all people, you should've known better.
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to live with that, right?
But what I, what I don't understand is why you are here.
Why you are working this case.
Like I said-- you broke the law.
It's really that simple.
No, no, no. I'm a cop.
I've been reading liars half my life.
It can't be that simple.
Okay, well, you're gonna have a lot of time
on the plane to think it through.
Oh, well, I already, um,
I already thought it through a little bit.
Tell me what you think. Uh...
Reyes was on your payroll.
Or the Colombians... or both, whatever.
And, um, whatever he was into is still in play
because now somebody wants payback.
Not payback for his murder.
I'm sure his mother didn't even care about that.
But, no, you need someone to take the fall, uh,
because Reyes expired
before you got what you wanted out of him.
Am I... close? Ballpark?
I'm gonna get you a book for the plane.
I sign that, what does my daughter find out?
What does she hear?
What she reads in the papers.
That's all.
And if she comes to visit you,
that's on the Colombians.
There is really no reason to make this any more complicated.
I'm sorry, what does that mean?
Is that a threat?
Are you threatening me?
You threatening my family?
I don't understand.
Don't be so shortsighted, Detective.
Sign the waiver...
and then we're done.
Ellie, what are you doing here?
If anybody asks, this fell out of a truck.
Steve, you should know the hearing's being held today.
An associate close to the judge just told me
Danny's gonna waive extradition.
Wait a minute--
he-he's voluntarily surrendering to the Colombians?
Why would he do that?
I don't know. But as soon as the judge signs that order,
Danny's gone.
Judge is ready.
Hey! Hey, Danny! Danny!
Commander McGarrett?
I'm gonna have to ask you to step back from the prisoner.
Who are you? Huh?
Steve, it's okay.
No, it's not okay. This man has been denied counsel.
That's a violation of his civil rights, you understand that?
Uh, this man refused counsel, Commander.
Why would you do that, Danny?
What did you threaten him with?
He-he didn't threaten me.
Steve, listen to me.
I signed the paper.
Everything's okay.
Just please talk to Grace
and tell her I'm okay
and that I'm gonna call her soon as I can.
Can you do that, please?
I'm not going anywhere.
You listen to me, listen to me.
I was there.
When Marco Reyes was murdered,
I was in the room--
You understand? You hearing me?
If the Colombians want Danny,
they want me, too.
Yeah, well, then you're lucky
that your friend here is keeping you off their radar.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not gonna let you do that.
You're not gonna sign an extradition to protect me.
What are you doing?
You don't have a choice.
Deal's been made.
Call Grace, huh?
Call Gra...
Call Grace, huh?
Promise me you'll talk to Grace.
How's my brother-in-law?
How do you think?
Well,
I didn't tell him to come to me for money.
He did that all on his own.
Yeah, about that money you gave him.
He told me every penny
went to buy back Detective Williams' brother.
Well, that sounds like a noble cause.
But I gave Chin that money to move me out of general pop.
And for that, he got $5 Million.
That's a lot of money for a change of scenery.
True.
But being the brother-in-law of a cop
didn't make me very popular in Halawa.
So what it came down to was that money or my life.
And you'll testify to that?
And see that hypocrite go to jail?
Absolutely.
But you're gonna need to sweeten the deal.
I'm listening.
I want a sentence reduction.
You're a cop killer.
That's not gonna happen.
Then I guess you won't be getting Chin Ho Kelly.
I can try to get you a commuted sentence.
Submit a petition to the governor.
I have a better chance of winning the lottery.
How does minimum security sound?
Not good enough.
That's all I got.
I want that in writing.
I'll have it drawn up.
Okay, so Duke's standing by.
As soon as Coughlin surfaces,
we're gonna put a tail on him
and find out where he's holding Gabriel.
Duke's a good man.
Yeah.
How you holding up?
The truth?
Yeah.
I, um, I can't shake this feeling in my gut
that my cousin is gonna go to prison this time.
You know, after their last go-around,
Coughlin's way too smart to go after Chin
without knowing for sure that he has an airtight case.
The Asset Forfeiture Team
from the State Attorney General's Office
already sealed up his house.
His property's being seized...
He's losing everything
that he ever worked and fought for his entire life.
Chin knew the risks when he was asking for that money.
He didn't care, 'cause Danny was in trouble
and your cousin was there.
Now we're gonna be there for him.
And if Chin's gonna go down,
he's not gonna go down without a fight.
I like the sound of that.
Good.
Come here.
He'll be all right.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Steve... I just heard from my contact.
It turns out that there was more to Danny's arrest
than just bringing him to justice for the Reyes murder.
What else could it have been about?
It was an apology of sorts.
Reyes was in the middle of a big deal
when he was killed on the CIA's watch,
and somebody has to answer for that.
How big a deal we talking about?
$1.3 billion of cocaine never made it to market.
Reyes was the only one who knew where that shipment was.
The CIA's been looking for it ever since he was killed.
So this whole thing-- none of it, none of it
is about finding justice for Reyes' murder.
It's about the missing dope.
What the...?
What the hell do you think you're doing, Commander?
Want to make a deal.
Deal about what?
Danny's freedom for that shipment of cocaine
you've been looking for.
Yeah. You'd better watch your driving.
We know where it is.
We know where it is, all right?
But you, uh, you don't get to see it
until Danny's been released
with paperwork exonerating him.
Well, that's a nice offer, but he's gone.
What do you mean he's gone?
I just took Detective Williams to the plane two hours ago.
He's on his way to Bogotá?
But you find that cocaine,
and I can guarantee you that the Colombian government
will, uh... will approve that.
Give me 48 hours.
Done.
Good luck.
We have no idea where that cocaine is.
No, we don't.
Guy come in with a warrant, nothing I can do.
Hey, I don't care what your warrant says,
you got five seconds to leave this office.
You having a bad day, Commander?
Five...
You really gonna protect a crooked cop?
Four...
You understand you are interfering with
an official investigation.
Three...
There will be consequences.
Two...
Very well.
I already have what I need.
That stays here. That stays here.
I'm afraid it's not up to you.
I can read it to you if you like.
Or not.
Have a good evening, gentlemen.
Stay focused.
Guys, come on.
We've been over all this stuff three times.
There's nothing in any of this stuff
that's gonna tell us where Reyes hid three tons of cocaine.
If the National Police can't find it in their raids,
there's no way we're gonna do this
from 6,000 miles away without
kicking in some doors.
I mean, we can't just go down there without good intel.
In 39 hours, the clock stops.
Okay, so the tail on Coughlin just came through.
Gabriel's being held in a safe house just outside Hau'ula.
I.A.'s got it on lockdown.
We're not gonna be able to get to him
without it getting ugly.
Doesn't matter. He's not gonna be there long anyway.
As soon as Coughlin locks up his case against Chin,
Gabriel's going right back inside.
All right.
No one person is more important than the other,
but Chin is here
and Danny is a cop in a South American prison.
If we don't move fast, he's not gonna last the week.
I'll be back.
There's something I need to take care of, too, all right?
Where are you go...?
Where is everybody going?
Where you going?
Danno!
They said he was arrested for murder.
It's a complicated situation.
Is it true? Did he kill someone?
Who is it?
Was he bad?
Gracie, listen to me, all right?
You have to believe in your father.
Your dad, he's the best man I know,
and everything he does,
he does to protect the people he loves.
So, no matter what happens, you got to know that.
Okay.
Come here.
I promise you, kid,
I promise I'm gonna bring Danno home, all right?
Okay.
I love you.
Here's what I got from my contact.
This is an oil refinery owned by an old Marco Reyes front man.
Someone that he grew up with and trusted completely.
So, why do we think the coke's there?
Steve, you said that Reyes delivered
Danny's brother's body in an oil drum?
That's right. According to my contact,
the CIA did not know about Matty until after he was murdered.
That got me thinking-- Reyes had to have held him
in a place that his partners
and the government did not even know about.
Okay, so there's security.
Armed guards, 40 strong.
It's guerilla country.
Maybe they're just protecting the refinery.
Negative. That refinery's been offline for five years.
Which begs the question:
Why the security in a defunct facility?
What is there that's worth protecting?
How reliable is your contact?
110%.
Okay. We got one shot at this.
If the intel's good, we got a chance of bringing Danny home.
If it's not,
we could all end up in a South American prison.
* I'm... *
* so in love with you *
* whatever you want me to *
* is all right with me *
* Cause you make me feel *
* so brand-new... *
Funky Joe White and his Musketeers.
Frank.
Thought you guys had stood me up.
What is this, Frank?
You said you needed transportation.
What's with you and salvage?
Kid, this is a perfectly good example of vintage aviation.
It's a washing machine with propellers.
Big man, you're not exactly paying top dollar here.
In fact, you're not paying anything at all.
So if I were you,
I'd grab a double-wide seat and keep a bag handy.
Hang on a second.
I know this old hippie didn't just call me fat.
Lou Grover, meet Frank Bama.
Best rotor-head to get you in country.
Yeah.
Yep.
We're gonna need to
work on a little weight distribution with you.
He just did it again.
All right, let's get this bird in the air.
We got weather coming.
Don't worry.
It's gonna get done.
Trust me.
The first one is free.
Let me guess. Second one's gonna cost me?
The only way you going to survive in here,
amigo, is if you pay.
Understand?
You give us money,
you get to live.
You don't...
I-I... I can get you money.
I just need to make a phone call, all right?
Of course.
Whatever you need, amigo.
All right.
Steve, I got radio contact with the ground
asking us to identify ourselves.
How far out are we?
Six klicks.
Ignore it.
That's what I thought you'd say.
Guess they didn't like our answer.
Contact! Spot your targets!
Conserve your ammo!
Go ahead.
Make your phone call.
Get us our money.
Hello?
Hey, monkey, how are you?
You all right?
I love you very much.
Danno, where are you?
Are you okay?
Of course I'm okay.
I'm always okay, huh?
How are you? I love you.
I love you, too, Daddy.
But when are you coming home?
I'm gonna come home very soon, monkey.
Right away. You hear me?
You think this is a game?
I don't think it's a game. No.
We gave you a chance, and you blew it.
You like to make a dramatic entrance, don't you?
Yeah, well, uh, we found your coke.
Where is it?
Well, it's gone.
What do you mean, "Gone"?
I mean, uh, we destroyed it.
You realize you just signed
your friend's death warrant, right?
I don't think so. You see, at the same location,
we didn't just find the drugs.
We found Reyes' books.
This, right here, is everything
to do with Sandpiper.
Including all the payoff accounts.
Hey, see, Marco Reyes was, uh,
he was paying money to a bunch of different people--
various Colombian generals,
politicians, government officials...
...and one American.
You.
You never cared about justice;
you never cared about the law.
All you wanted was your piece of the action.
You are meddling in international affairs, Commander.
Just shut up and listen.
This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna have Detective Williams returned to U.S. Soil
with all charges dropped.
And the second his plane touches down in Oahu,
you're gonna resign,
you're gonna collect your pension,
and then you're gonna disappear.
And if you don't,
this gets released.
It's all there,
just as we agreed.
All it needs is your signature.
Lieutenant...
Sign here and you can go.
I don't understand. Where's Coughlin?
Cuz...
Kono, what's going on?
Coughlin's dead.
And Gabriel's gone.
What?
He killed Coughlin and then he escaped.
You know, I'm thinking that was his plan all along.
To get him to move him,
trust him, and then strike.
But now,
without Coughlin or Gabriel's testimony,
there's no case against you.
Thank you.
Or you could say "Mahalo""
I suppose I could.
Still, huh? After all these years, you still hate this place.
Oh, no, buddy, I'm still trying to figure out a way to like you.
Okay? Forget this place.
Fair enough.
Let me ask you a question.
Why didn't you lawyer up?
Why didn't you get a lawyer to fight this thing?
I don't understand.
I don't know. I don't think there's any lawyer
who could change what I did.
They... they could get you off, Danny.
Look, I, uh, I've been living with what I did,
feeling a certain way about it
ever since I did it.
Okay? And maybe some crazy part of me
just didn't want to feel that way anymore.
You know?
I guess.
But that does not mean that I am not
happy and grateful that I am here,
so thank you, partner.
You're the one who was ready to go to jail
to keep me out of it.
I should be thanking you.
That's what family does, right?
Yeah.
Danno.
Speaking of which... How do I look?
You look great.
Thanks.
Danno.
Danno.
I missed you.
I told you I was coming home.
We earned our Trident today.
Hooyah.
Steve, I know you were surveilling me
while I was in quarantine.
And I can't say I blame you, but...
this suspicion has to stop.
I need you to trust me.
All right. Just give me a reason, Joe.
Well, I will, if you give me a chance.
All right.
Good. I appreciate that.
You know, I'd, uh... I'd still like to thank your contact.
I mean, whoever gave you that classified intel
on the refinery really put themself on the line.
Who owes you, Joe?
It's not who owed me, Steve, it's who owes you.
It was your mother.
That the real reason I wasn't arrested with Danny?
Yes.
You're welcome.
