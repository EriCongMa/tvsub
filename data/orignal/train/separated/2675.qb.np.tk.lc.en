she didn &apos;t know you were a girl .

woman doctor .
why did you take so long to tell her ?
i didn &apos;t .
you spilled the beans when you called .
let me ask you a different question . why a female ? why a female doctor ?
she asked the same frigging question , and i sometimes wonder myself .
and ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i told her .
it was between two jewish guys
and a paesana . so i picked the paesana .
what &apos;s the one thing your mother , wife and daughter have in common ?
they all break my balls .
i know what you mean . they &apos;re all italian , so what ?
so maybe by coming clean with me , you &apos;re dialoguing with them .
let me ask you a question .

he used to run around breaking balls .
dominic .
my namesake .

what &apos;d i say about this poison ? these kids shouldn &apos;t touch it !
i read the paper every day about these poor pricks overdosing .
he didn &apos;t overdose , he killed himself .
fourteen years old .
jesus ! -was this at patterson falls ? holy shit , that was your grandson ?

he took one of those designer drugs .

hesh ? what about him ?
whoever heard of a jew riding horses ?
he owns a horse farm .
he &apos;s tony &apos;s friend , not mine .
what have you got against him ?
who , me ? nothing .
johnny liked him .
and my son thinks every word that comes out of his mouth is pure gold .
are you telling me that since i &apos;m the new boss , i should tax hesh ?
boy , anthony must &apos;ve really gotten under your collar . admit it .
you want to crack his coglioni for putting you in here .
what are you talking about ?
yeah.and i &apos;m playing shortstop for the mets .
all right , watch the balls !
what is the matter ?
tony &apos;s cannoli doesn &apos;t want to stand up ?
tony &apos;s cannoli &apos;s tired .
but i can make it happen , baby .
i know .
just , maybe ....
so how &apos;s your job ?

you spoke to your uncle lately ?
junior ?
yeah .
no . i don &apos;t know . why , what &apos;s up ?
your father was a fair man .
what &apos;s that got to do with junior ?
junior &apos;s not so fair .
sometimes i wish you &apos;d just get to the point . what &apos;d he do ?
he &apos;s taxing me , tony .
he &apos;s taxing you ? when did this happen ? today .
did you tell him you operate without tax ?
that my father loved you and respected you ?
that 10 cents of every dollar in his kick is from you ?
my uncle &apos;s boss of the family 10 minutes , already i got agita !
what &apos;d you say ?
it &apos;s a reasonable request but an unreasonable figure .
what do you mean , reasonable request ?
he &apos;s the boss now , tony .
he calls the tune , we dance to it . that &apos;s the way it &apos;s done .
you can either respect that or change the rules .
tony , i came over here to tell you
with all this bullshit going on ...... i can &apos;t stay in this area .
where you gonna go ?
come on . i consider my royalty checks .
i wrote six gold records .
no , a couple of black kids did .
you just gave yourself a cowriting credit . come on , heshie .
i know you . you leave this , you &apos;re gonna kill yourself .
how much does he want ?
500 large . plus , two points monthly on my shy .
all right .
do me a favor , sit tight for now . let me think about it for a while .
how was that , baby ?
the best .
you are the best .
come here .
tony , i love your cannoli .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m okay .
go back to sleep .
sure you &apos;re all right ?
so , what do you want new york to do ?
junior can &apos;t know that we talked .
he &apos;s gotta think that hesh came to you on his own , by himself .
you are still running things .
the arrangement , whatever it is , can &apos;t be insulting to my uncle .
hesh has got to pay something .
i just haven &apos;t decided what .
i gotta get back . we &apos;ll talk later .
how &apos;s the veal ?
it &apos;s like rubber .
yeah ?
tastes all right to me .
want something else ?
don &apos;t look at me .
compliments of johnny sack .
why don &apos;t you spend the rest of our anniversary with him ?
i was over there for 10 frigging minutes , carmela .
don &apos;t do this .
all right , tony.at least i know where i stand .
why do you always gotta be so dramatic ?
oh , here we go .
all right , i &apos;m sorry , okay ? i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re apologizing for .
it &apos;s our anniversary , tony .
ours . not yours , mine and johnny @-@ fucking @-@ sack &apos;s.ours.
i thought we could get a room at the plaza like last year or ....
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t--
i &apos;m sorry , carmela .
i just got a lot on my mind and i &apos;m not thinking straight .
... i &apos;m sorry .
should i call the plaza ?
come on .
no , let &apos;s go home .
hey , come here .
carm , what do you want me to say ?
tell me . i &apos;m lost at sea here !
you &apos;ve changed , tony . and i resent it .
it &apos;s destroying what little self @-@ esteem i have left .
sometimes i think you skeeve me .
i skeeve you ?
you &apos;re the mother of my children . how could i ?
you see what i &apos;m talking about ? there .
&quot; you &apos;re the mother of my children . &quot; i &apos;m just someone you procreated with .
you know it could be the prozac .
ginny torrelli &apos;s been on it for years ,
and she &apos;d hump a fire hydrant .
dr. melfi said it had different side effects .
oh . she told you that ?
before we start today &apos;s session ...
... we need to address the coffee .
it &apos;s not appropriate of me to take gifts .
it &apos;s a cup of coffee .
let &apos;s just make a rule , okay ?
no gifts .
does this mean i can &apos;t drink mine ?
no .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i usually have my answering service on , but i have a car emergency .
yes ?
what does that mean , &quot; diagnostic &quot; ?
i just want to know what &apos;s wrong with my car .
no . no , don &apos;t do anything .
no , i want to get a second opinion .
i &apos;ll take my chances . thank you .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m really sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
so how &apos;s it going ?
good .
real good .
i think i may flush the medication , you know ?
see if the changes i &apos;m feeling are for real .
why would you do that ? the prozac seems to be working .
that might be the problem .
it might be working overtime .
what do you mean ?
i &apos;m having a--
reaction ?
you know , a side effect from the stuff .
we talked about that .
some people get insomnia .
others , a stomachache or headaches .
but it usually passes .
but are there any other side effects that you know of ?
some people experience a diminished libido .
they have a hard time getting or maintaining--
bingo ! -i see .
you know , not all impotence is a result of the medication .
there &apos;s something wrong with me ?
have you had a prostate exam ?
i don &apos;t even let anybody wag their finger in my face .
i &apos;m sorry , i shouldn &apos;t have laughed .
don &apos;t apologize .
oh , boy .
you got a nice laugh .
all right , let &apos;s be serious .
hey . i &apos;m serious .
you know that depression is also a leading factor in impotence .
in the morning or at night do you ever have an erection ?
you could set your clock to it .
okay , so we know it &apos;s not a physical problem .
put that in after the credenza .
yes , ma &apos;am .
what &apos;s going on ?
yeah , i bought some furniture .
let &apos;s just move into roche bobois , save the delivery charge .
fine , i &apos;ll send it back .
no . but you &apos;ve been spending like a drunken sailor .
i said i &apos;ll send it back .
mother of christ , i didn &apos;t say that , did i ?
jesus !
you shouldn &apos;t be telling my uncle how to run things .
you think i got the balls
to tell your uncle how he should run things ?
i shouldn &apos;t expect to see the statue of liberty again if i did .
all right , look , tony ...
... hesh isn &apos;t only a friend of you guys , he &apos;s a friend of ours .
somebody has to step in so he doesn &apos;t get fucked .
i never said , &quot; fucked . &quot;
you should &apos;ve come to me first , airing
your dirty laundry in public .
how would it look
if i went to you after i spoke to him ?
now he &apos;s got a point .
bottom line is ...
... what are we gonna do ?
you have a suggestion ?
if there are any flies on you , they &apos;re paying fucking rent .
500 &apos;s a little steep for back taxes , no ?
the 2 percent of his action , that &apos;s up to you .
it affects tony ...... as much as hesh .
i &apos;m not out to hurt anyone .
god forbid i get in the way of someone earning .
one and a half on the shy business and 300 on the back tax .
250 .
hold on to your cock
when you negotiate with these desert people .
250 .
all right .
mr. soprano .
you want sex ?
no .
go back to sleep .
you know , you have a nice body . you should make it work for you more .
oh , really ?
yeah , you reveal too much .
you don &apos;t want other men looking at me ?
no , when you &apos;re not with me , you do what you want .
but i &apos;m saying maybe you could wear a nice businesslike outfit .
i think i could get into that .
you want me to dress like a man ? -no .
i don &apos;t want you to dress like a man .
i &apos;m just saying maybe wear something a little more professional .
like you &apos;re in business .
well , fuck you , tony . i &apos;m no whore .
no .
that &apos;s not what i mean , not like you &apos;re in the whore business ....
oh , forget it .
come here .
is everyone in my life bananas or what ?
get over here !
come-- -go jerk off !
yeah . go jerk off .
look at this . she burned me .
that &apos;s not good .
what led up to that ?
carmela can be pretty violent .
this added problem that i &apos;ve been having ...
... i just thought we needed to spice things up a little bit .
if it &apos;s not the prozac , then maybe i just need a little jump @-@ start .
i suggested that maybe she dress a little different .
something titillating ?
yeah.maybe it &apos;d help .
so i suggested to her ...
... not demanded ...
... suggested ...
... you know , maybe dress a little sexier .
but carmela can be very sensitive .
maybe she felt it degraded her .
not all women are into sexy lingerie .
it &apos;s not about dressing like that .
then what are we talking about ?
some women are sexier when they dress simple .
you know , understated .
and i don &apos;t mean ....
fuck it , i don &apos;t know what i mean .
like you .
how like me ?
you play it down .
now , it &apos;s obvious you got a killer body under there .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
all right .
not only do you play it down ...
... but you &apos;re gentle .
not loud .
sweet @-@ sounding .
like a mandolin .
anthony .
unfortunately , we have to stop now .
i think it &apos;s important that we talk about this .
do you think you could come back later this afternoon ?
no .
till tuesday .
okay ?
yeah , all right .
see you tuesday .
it &apos;s the oddest thing . i &apos;ve had this problem for weeks .
but this morning , i get in and it starts right up .
and then again at the deli .
looks fine .
are you sure ? i was told i need a new starter .
lady ...
... as much as i might wish to rob you , i won &apos;t try to replace a new starter .
what do you mean , &quot; new &quot; ?
new.it has everything but the price tag hanging from it .
i didn &apos;t do nothing !
poor kid committed suicide up here because of you .
you fucking know me !
i know you .
listen , big boy . listen to me , i &apos;m gonna give you a break .
i &apos;m gonna give you a break . when i toss you over ...
... when i toss you over ,
if you fly , i won &apos;t shoot you down . deal ?
no !
no !
well , my goodness .
what happened here ?
some said shit .
motherfucker said he didn &apos;t want to live no more .
jumped .
how much you give him ?
i thought i was the only one junior could make look like that .
all right , let me hear it .
rusty irish .
what about him ?
took a header off the falls .
it &apos;s the closest that junkie ever got to a bath .
i got news for you . that junkie was my biggest earner .
he moved more cards than 10 guys put together . and another thing :
he should &apos;ve checked with me before he did a favor for capri .
you &apos;re losing me .
irish sold capri &apos;s grandson that shit .
you created a frankenstein in junior .
i created ?
we agreed to let junior have his day .
&quot; let him be the lightning rod , and when somebody goes down ......
he &apos;s not a young man with a family . &quot; we agreed .
we agreed , but who expected to get raped ?
when jackie was boss , it all evened out at the end of the day .
but your uncle , madonna , does he eat alone !
he doesn &apos;t even pass the salt .
what about sammy grigio &apos;s card game ? mikey beat him up . that ain &apos;t right .
even a broken clock is right twice a day .
junior had a position .
that game wasn &apos;t paying anybody .
the minute sammy grigio used jimmy &apos;s name , it should &apos;ve been end of story .
that &apos;s right .
what do you want me to do ?
we made our bed , we sleep in it .
how long will we kick upstairs without it hurting ?
something , anything should trickle down over here , no ?
all we want you to do is talk to him .
after all , he &apos;s your uncle . come on .
that &apos;s right .
who is it ?
it &apos;s me , ma .
who ?
anthony .
open the door .
i thought it was the activities lady . she &apos;s a real pain in the ass .
playing bingo , livia ?
oh , not tonight , honey .
you know , she &apos;s a degenerate gambler .
milly . milly ?
my son .
handsome .
so how &apos;s it going ?
oh , what can i say ?
hey , this is great !
you only need that broken reading lamp you had by the phone at home .
and i got it downstairs . i can bring it .
listen !
oh , she &apos;s driving me crazy !
who ?
next door ! there it is again .
that &apos;s enough water ! how much water does she need ?
she runs the water all day . water , water , water !
i &apos;m living next door to gunga din !
i went to ferrara &apos;s . i got you biscotti .
almonds ?
yeah .
all right . leave them there .
i &apos;ll take them downstairs later for my coffee .
uncle jun been by ?
oh , once in a while . it makes him uncomfortable here .
he &apos;s got a lot on his mind . more responsibilities means more headaches .
better men than him had to work hard .
yeah ?
he &apos;ll be all right .
if he remembers who his friends are .
i &apos;d hate to see him mess up . he &apos;s been waiting a long time .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s not a business that forgives bad decisions .
and i hate to see him making wrong moves , you know .
especially at the beginning .
why you telling me ? tell him .
ma , you got his ear.he listens to you .
i don &apos;t know that world .
no , of course not .
but if anything , you know , were to come up , that &apos;s all .
i don &apos;t want to get involved .
if you have something to say to your uncle , bring it up to him .
oh , i wish the lord would take me .
come on , ma .
there &apos;s plenty of nice gents that want a date with you .
look . i &apos;m going downstairs .
i &apos;m going downstairs before that che bruta activities lady finds me .
you want coffee ?
yeah , all right .
bring the cookies !
carmela , i don &apos;t want to sound like religion is a cure @-@ all ...
... but if tony got more involved with the church ...
... it may help to expedite things in his therapy .
what &apos;s killing me is that this is a self @-@ inflicted wound .
i pushed for it .
i could deal with the goomars . i knew i was better than them .
as stupid as it sounds , i viewed them as a form of masturbation for him .
i couldn &apos;t give him what he needed all the time .
you &apos;re a man . you know that thirst .
i was too busy with the house and the kids to quench it .
but this psychiatrist ...
... you know , she &apos;s not just a goomar .
now i feel like he &apos;s really cheating and i &apos;m the one who &apos;s thirsty .
i &apos;m not gonna stay in a marriage that &apos;s made--
let &apos;s not even think about that .
divorce is for those
who never intended on dying married in the first place .
you know , carm , we reap what we sow .
what do you mean ?
you admit to accepting his dalliances in the past .
schifosas . they meant nothing .
but you said it was like they were &quot; lightening the workload ... &quot;
... providing a wife &apos;s duty when you were too busy .
you practically welcomed it .
now , i want you to pray ...
... to our holy mother , ask her for guidance and forgiveness ...
... so that you can get through this as a couple .
you &apos;re not without sin in this , carmela .
so she &apos;s out of control .
she spends money like we &apos;re the sopranos of park avenue .
but you &apos;ve noticed her . which may have been the point .
look , before we run out of time ...
... i &apos;d like to discuss what happened when we were here last week .
how &apos;s your car ?
did you steal my car and have it fixed ?
we had an agreement , no gifts .
i didn &apos;t want you to get robbed .
it was you .
you had no right to steal my car .
i &apos;ve been scared to death .
why ? -why ?
it &apos;s a violation of my privacy . what else have you done ?
answer me .
i love you .
anthony .
i &apos;m in love with you .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just the way it is .
okay . let me talk .
no .
it &apos;s not the prozac .
i dream about you .
i think about you all the time .
i can &apos;t get excited about other women .
there &apos;s nothing else to say .
i love you .
let me start here .
i know this may be very hard for you to swallow .
but you &apos;re only feeling this way because we &apos;ve made such progress .
what ?
i &apos;ve been gentle . that &apos;s my job .
i listen . that &apos;s what i do best .
i &apos;ve been a broad , generic , sympathetic woman to you ...
... because that &apos;s what this work calls for .
you &apos;ve made me all of the things you feel are missing in your wife .
and in your mother .
you &apos;re making me out to be some fucking mama &apos;s boy .
i &apos;m a man .
and you &apos;re a woman .
end of story .
and this crap about freud and ...
... every boy wanting to have sex with his mother , that &apos;s not gonna fly here .
i didn &apos;t say that .
i want to make sure we understand each other .
yeah , we understand each other .
you don &apos;t love me .
you don &apos;t want me to come back anymore .
it &apos;s quite the opposite .
this is all a byproduct of progress .
has someone been following me ?
okay , forget it .
i &apos;ll see you next week .
all right , let &apos;s go !
listen , uncle junior--
you could &apos;ve made the pros .
you could &apos;ve done it . you had a swing like joe d.
you &apos;re crazy .
what ?
you think i &apos;m shitting you ?
i could barely hit .250 .
because you didn &apos;t want it .
too busy chasing skirt . chasing skirt , your average was .500 .
yeah , what happened ?
what did you want to talk about ?
octavian .
you know , augustus .
you fucking with me ? no . octavian became augustus .
forget about that .
bottom line : augustus was a caesar . and everybody loved him , right ?
you know why ?
i don &apos;t know that i give a fuck .
everybody loved him because he never ate alone . capisci ?
it was the longest time of peace in rome &apos;s history .
he was a fair leader and all his people loved him for that .
is this the one that they stabbed in the back ?
no , that was julius . talking about augustus .
he shared his wealth and all his people loved him .
you said that three times .
i heard it . his people loved him . what &apos;s your point ?
remember when you told me about the bull and his son ?
they &apos;re looking out at a bunch of cows .
the son says , &quot; dad , why don &apos;t we run down and fuck one of these cows ? &quot;
what did the dad say ?
the father says , &quot; son , why don &apos;t we walk down there and fuck them all ? &quot;
i told you that ? &quot; why don &apos;t we fuck them all . &quot;
that &apos;s funny .
okay , i get your point .
why all of this fucking augustus @-@ octavian shit ?
i don &apos;t know .
are you okay ? you &apos;ve been acting mezzo morto lately .
i ain &apos;t seen you like that for years .
i &apos;m okay . it &apos;s just bullshit stuff . don &apos;t worry about it .
are you sure ?
yeah , yeah . i &apos;m okay .
junior took your 250 and split it amongst the top five guys .
so he doesn &apos;t look greedy .
smart move .
yeah .
your uncle may be another harry truman .
what &apos;s that mean ?
he didn &apos;t want it , but in the end he made some pretty wise decisions .
your uncle may be the right man .
i fucking hope so .
i &apos;ll tell you , i don &apos;t want the job .
let junior die from the stress .
that &apos;s what gave jackie the cancer , god rest his soul .
&quot; boss . &quot; fuck it , who needs it ?
it &apos;s nice here .
i can &apos;t stand the smell . the shit , flies all over .
but i could watch them for hours . there &apos;s a kind of beauty to it.i envy them .
i wouldn &apos;t go that far .
i would . they got no bills , no headaches , no family cazzi running around .
one horse likes another one , they fuck .
that &apos;s it.no problems . no hundred questions . no guilt .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m talking about .
so junior split my money and spread it around ?
yeah .
five bosses , 50 a pop .
not a bad day &apos;s pay .
still , i wish it wasn &apos;t your money .
you know , it makes me feel terrible .
what ?
you old fucking jew .
