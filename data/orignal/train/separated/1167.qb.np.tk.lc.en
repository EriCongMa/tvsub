is there any way i could take this on monday ?
what about after school tomorrow ?
i can &apos;t . i have community service .
it &apos;s a community crisis hotline .
this is a transcript of a call that came in last night .
&quot; i almost got caught tonight .
it &apos;s gone and i can &apos;t get it back .
i might as well be dead &quot;
i never wanted to hurt anybody , but now i have to .
hello .
ezra .
i really needed to hear your ...
i know .
but you can &apos;t call here anymore .
oh , my god , that &apos;s awesome !
a surprise party at the lake house . i just need your help .
caleb &apos;s probably never even had a birthday party before .
i don &apos;t know this emily .
i think you &apos;ll like her .
i want to make sure she still likes me .
hey . we thought you guys were still overseas .
oh , yeah , we just got back last week .
holden ! look who &apos;s here ?
hey . how &apos;s it going ?
good .
please don &apos;t do something you &apos;re gonna regret , lucas .
hanna !
do not answer that .
forget the fireworks . forget everything !
this is not about the stupid fireworks , hanna !
where &apos;s lucas ? is he still out there ?
here &apos;s some aspirin .
you want me to make you some soup ?
thanks , but i &apos;m not hungry .
you want a blanket ?
sure .
here &apos;s your bag .
i think caleb called . your phone was making noise .
han ? now , i know that you might not be ready to talk about this ,
but the sheriff said that they &apos;re gonna drag
the lake first thing in the morning .
lucas isn &apos;t in the lake .
he didn &apos;t come up to shore .
we waited .
he knows how to swim , all right ?
he &apos;s out there somewhere .
i can feel it .
i @-@ i still can &apos;t believe that lucas would help &quot; a. &quot;
why not ? jenna did the same thing with caleb .
&quot; a &quot; knows lucas is close to hanna .
no , i @-@ i get it , i just don &apos;t
really see lucas as being that violent .
he can be .
lucas was the one who destroyed alison &apos;s memorial .
i found out the night i got out of the hospital .
why didn &apos;t you tell us ?
told me to keep a secret .
why ?
to protect him .
he &apos;s been through a lot .
alison really tortured him .
maybe it &apos;s time to start protecting you .
i have a headache .
hanna , don &apos;t drink that !
that &apos;s lake water .
too late .
how did that get in there ?
the bag was outside in the car .
but all of us were in here .
yeah , lucas wasn &apos;t .
maybe he just wants to finish what he started .
no fun chugging lake water , is it ?
choke on this , bitch . &quot; a. &quot;
okay , thanks .
lucas called his parents today .
and he &apos;s still not home ?
they must be going out of their minds .
did he say where he is , where he &apos;s been ?
was there drinking at this party ?
no .
did he argue with someone ? hanna !
i don &apos;t know .
i should call them .
can you give me their home number ?
no , why do you have to call them ?
because my daughter hosted a party
that their son has yet to return from .
i should at least take some responsibility for that .
look , i know you &apos;re upset and frustrated
that your friend is going through something
and he ran off instead of turning to you for help .
i &apos;m sure when he &apos;s ready
lucas will tell you what &apos;s going on with him .
uh , we should go to spencer &apos;s .
aren &apos;t you gonna see her at school ?
we have a group presentation ,
and we need to run it one more time .
&quot; a &quot; was definitely in my lake house .
you found these in the attic ?
the picture caleb decrypted off &quot; a &quot; cell phone of the dolls ,
that was taken at the lake house .
looks like &quot; a &quot; got pretty cozy .
well , my family never uses that house after labor day .
it &apos;s the perfect place to set up an evil lair .
and look . just look at the date on this .
wait , that &apos;s around the time caleb and i went up there .
&quot; a &quot; was in the lake house when caleb and i were ...
&quot; fraternizing &quot; on my nana &apos;s sofa .
okay , who told ?
it doesn &apos;t even matter .
there are , like , four bedrooms up there
with actual beds in them .
did you guys see anybody , hear anything ?
em , we were kind of busy .
yeah , you were gettin &apos; busy .
okay , so , wait . you said that lucas went
up in the attic like he knew his way around ?
he was probably trying to clean up
after garrett and jenna .
and look .
there &apos;s an address .
smitty &apos;s . 801 hyperion street .
wait , smitty &apos;s what ? restaurant ? bar ?
hyperion street . isn &apos;t that in philly ?
do you guys want to go after school to check it out ?
okay . yeah . if it means you &apos;re not going alone ,
then count me in .
is it okay if i pass ?
i still have the taste of lake water in my mouth .
i could &apos;ve sworn that my mom caught me .
told her i was making a date with holden .
holden strauss ? i thought he was in portugal .
wh- and why were you calling ezra from your own phone ?
because i couldn &apos;t think of a good excuse
to get out of the house and use yours .
not that it really matters . ezra &apos;s stopped answering .
dad threatened to turn him into the police .
what ? aria , i &apos;m so sorry .
i thought that my parents would understand ,
or at least try .
they both know how great of a guy-- hey , holden .
hey , aria . spencer , hey , good to see you .
yeah , how was your year abroad ?
uh , my dad was studying algae in a river delta .
i spent a lot of time in hip waders ,
which was ... really lame .
anyway , so , uh , i was wondering
if you wanted to go out tonight .
i @-@ i can &apos;t . but thanks .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m grounded .
really ? your dad said it wouldn &apos;t be a problem .
oh , our parents talked ?
did my mom call to set us up ?
no , i @-@ i called to ask permission .
what ? who even does that anymore ?
my parents have been pushing this whole
&quot; return to kinder , gentler traditions &quot; agenda .
no , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s--
laugh now , but i &apos;ll be sending you
a handwritten thank @-@ you note
for letting me interrupt your conversation .
i &apos;m just kind of confused .
is this a date ?
is that weird ?
no , uh ...
it &apos;s just we &apos;ve known each other since preschool .
is it the whole glue thing ?
&apos;cause if i remember correctly , you dared me .
okay , no , that was not a dare . i was just misinformed .
i thought that if it looked like ranch dressing ...
well , now we &apos;re both old enough to know the difference , so ...
dinner , a movie ?
paste @-@ free , i promise .
okay . yeah . it &apos;d be great to hang out .
i &apos;ll think of something fun to do .
great . whatever you want .
just text me the details .
yeah , will do .
um , how weird is that ?
i use him as my alibi
and now he actually wants to go out ?
it &apos;s not that weird . he likes you .
no , we &apos;ve known each other forever .
you &apos;re cute , and he likes you .
he says it was for chem lab ,
but noel was on the phone with someone
all night at caleb &apos;s birthday party .
did you notice him acting sketchy at all ?
i don &apos;t know . i was kind of busy with other things .
what , lucas ?
who cares ?
first lucas ruins caleb &apos;s birthday party .
then he gets everyone in a tizzy because he &apos;s pretend @-@ missing .
need attention much ? he is so lame .
mona ...
can we veer back on topic ?
i think i &apos;m losing noel .
i had to take him skinny @-@ dipping that night
just to get his full attention .
then we got into this huge fight on the way home .
hanna !
where are you taking that ?
storage .
no , that &apos;s supposed to be hanging in the south lobby .
the principal said to take it down .
you didn &apos;t hear this from me ,
but the administration doesn &apos;t think tiaras
and orange jumpsuits are a good fit .
she &apos;s not giving up the crown !
so , what do you think ?
am i just being paranoid ?
hanna , are you even listening to me ?
yeah . yeah , sure .
what did i just say ?
you can &apos;t even tell me , can you ?
i listen to every drawn @-@ out whiny detail
when you have a problem with caleb ,
and you can &apos;t even bother to
nod your head and pretend like you care !
i &apos;m sorry ! okay , i have a lot going on right now .
so do i.
i just poured my heart out to someone who cares
more about her homecoming photo than her friend .
could you be any more selfish ?
hello ?
i have a problem .
who &apos;s calling .
you work for the crisis line .
don &apos;t i get to stay anonymous ?
uh , this is a private number .
private ? so , i can say anything i want ,
even something ... dirty ?
maya ?
inappropriate , i know .
well ?
aren &apos;t you gonna say it ?
say what ?
something dirty .
i &apos;d rather whisper it in your ear tonight .
we &apos;re still on to see that band you like , right ?
sure thing . we just--
oh , hold on a second . someone &apos;s on the other line .
do you have to take it ?
it can go to voicemail .
listen , you don &apos;t have a fake i.d. , do you ?
i never use it , but yeah .
do you have two ?
my parents ransacked my room
after i got shipped off to sober camp .
guess what they found ?
i think i can get you one .
that was ... easier than i thought .
anything else i can help you with ?
nope . i get to see my girl tonight .
problem solved .
see you later .
hello ?
so , as soon as i download this train schedule ,
we &apos;ll be good to go .
worst reception out here .
what are you doing ?
oh , buying tickets to the rangely playhouse .
weren &apos;t you supposed to go there with ezra ?
wait , how are you getting better service than i am ?
wait , switch places . come on .
yeah , well , now i &apos;m going with holden .
what happens if ezra &apos;s there .
that &apos;s the point .
ezra bought his tickets , like , two months ago ,
and he loves arthur miller ,
so i &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s looking forward to it ...
holden said that we could do whatever i wanted .
right . so , if ezra just happens to be there
and you happen to see him ...
and maybe we have fate on our side .
i just wish i didn &apos;t have to use holden to figure that out .
oh , come--
you &apos;re not--
next train is in 20 minutes .
we should probably get going .
what ?
lucas called again this morning
before i left for school .
man , staying there the last couple days
has been so awkward !
did you talk to him ?
his parents said he didn &apos;t want to talk to me ,
or that he wouldn &apos;t .
i think we should just go look for him .
did they tell you where he is ?
staying at his cousin &apos;s house .
said he didn &apos;t want to come home ,
that he had something to work out .
so i called his cousin .
it &apos;s pretty obvious the guy &apos;s covering for him .
i know a lie when i hear one .
lucas definitely isn &apos;t there .
well , there &apos;s not many places he &apos;d go , right ?
i mean , for all we know , he could be back in rosewood .
why would you say that ? have you heard from him ?
no .
i was thinking about checking out spencer &apos;s lake house .
you know , maybe he went back up there .
whatever it is that he &apos;s going through ,
i just-- i want to help .
caleb , when he &apos;s ready to talk , he &apos;ll talk .
i don &apos;t know that he will .
look , are you gonna come with me or not ?
i don &apos;t know , i just don &apos;t think
that we should go out in the middle of nowhere .
you don &apos;t want to find him .
why ?
i just don &apos;t think it &apos;s a good idea
to push him right now .
hanna , what happened in that boat ?
i already told you what happened .
not the whole story .
there is no story .
you &apos;re not being honest with me .
are you calling me a liar ?
just stop , okay ? tell me what you know .
we have always told each other the truth .
if you want to go find lucas , then go .
no one &apos;s stopping you .
caleb ...
this would be so much easier
if we actually knew what we were looking for .
are you sure that we got off at the right stop ?
yeah . the map says it should be right around here .
801 hyperion .
but this ... can &apos;t be right .
it says smitty &apos;s right on the sign .
yeah , 803 &apos;s right there .
800 &apos;s across the street , so ...
well , is there anything else on the receipt
that would say what &quot; a &quot; or its helper was here for ?
no , it &apos;s just magazines .
well , there &apos;s a toy store down the road .
maybe &quot; a &quot; sent lucas down here to pick up
that four @-@ pack of chucky dolls .
your parents work in the city .
maybe they just stopped here for some gum and magazines .
yeah , maybe , but what about those cell phones ?
those didn &apos;t look like they belonged to my parents .
wait , isn &apos;t melissa &apos;s condo , like ,
ten blocks from here ?
i &apos;m starting to think this is kind of a bust .
do you want to grab a coffee ?
mm , i can &apos;t .
i promised holden i &apos;d meet him at 7 : 30 .
am i doing the right thing ?
yes ! i mean , you &apos;re taking a chance ,
but you &apos;re being bold and romantic .
you call me later to let me know how it turns out ?
i will .
okay .
bye .
the calls come in on this line ,
and i log the numbers here .
and this manual has all the emergency numbers
and organizations that we can refer people to .
i think it &apos;s so cool that you &apos;re helping people .
they &apos;re lucky they get you on the other end of the line .
i need to run home and change ,
and we can grab dinner before we go out .
sounds like a plan .
it &apos;s me .
everything okay ?
yeah , yeah .
actually , i &apos;m sorry , i sort of have to deal with this .
yeah , no worries . i need to go sign out .
um , would it be okay if i caught up with you later ?
sure .
okay .
i will get dinner and meet you back at your house .
can i help you ?
um , i &apos;m not sure .
i &apos;ve been away for a few years ,
and i was just trying to locate a former friend of mine .
she was a patient here . her name &apos;s jenna marshall .
patient records are confidential .
i don &apos;t need her medical information .
i just know that she went
to a school for the blind in philadelphia ,
so i thought it might be this one .
i can &apos;t even tell you which chair she used to sit in .
something else i can help you with ?
no . i guess that &apos;s it .
excuse me .
you &apos;re looking for jenna ?
i know her .
hey , hanna .
haven &apos;t you washed that already ?
like four times ?
yeah , but it still smells wretched .
where &apos;s maya ?
she &apos;s meeting me later ... i think .
maya &apos;s keeping something from me .
i mean , she keeps getting these calls
and these text messages ,
and i can tell it &apos;s making her upset .
i should just ask her about it , right ?
i mean , i &apos;m a part of her life again .
i should know what &apos;s going on , shouldn &apos;t i ?
why isn &apos;t anyone allowed to have a damn secret ?
because the calls , the texts ?
i &apos;m starting to worry
that it &apos;s &quot; a &quot; going after her .
em , just because we want to throw up
every time our phone rings ,
doesn &apos;t mean everyone else is living in fear .
you think i &apos;m paranoid ?
i think that maya could be bugging up
for a hundred different reasons
that have nothing to do with &quot; a. &quot;
and besides , if she is keeping something from you ,
maybe it &apos;s for your own good .
okay , hanna , promise me that you never
take a job at a crisis center .
i &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just caleb and i got in a fight ,
and i &apos;m just trying to protect him .
but it sucks being the girlfriend who knows too much .
yeah , well , it sucks just as bad
being the girlfriend who doesn &apos;t know enough .
here .
do you like real sugar or fake ?
real . i &apos;ll get it .
just tell me-- tell me what time it &apos;s at .
oh , uh , 11 : 00 .
neat trick , huh ?
yeah .
here .
feel the difference ?
yeah , the grains of sugar are bigger . huh .
so , you went to school with jenna in rosewood ?
uh , no . i knew her from before .
when she moved to rosewood , we kind of lost touch .
you and jenna got here around the same time ?
i was here a while before jenna showed up .
i have a genetic condition .
i &apos;ve been going blind slowly since i was born .
literally saw it coming .
when the lights went out ,
i wasn &apos;t ready .
i got angry , depressed .
meeting jenna pulled me out of it .
she helped you ?
she was so focused .
no , determined .
i think she learned more in a year
than most people learn here in four .
i guess she was motivated to get out of here .
for , like , field trips ?
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re in jail .
and they encourage us to get out on our own
and practice or whatever .
it &apos;s nice to have a change of scenery .
it &apos;s a joke , spencer ! you can laugh .
no , i &apos;m sorry . uh , i--
i guess i was just wondering where she went .
did she ever tell you
where she went or who she met ?
she kept saying she had things
she had to do back home .
i haven &apos;t talked to her in a while .
whatever it is , i hope she did it .
so , when do you get out of here ?
oh , i &apos;m done with rehab now .
i help out in the art studio a couple times a week .
if jenna hadn &apos;t dragged me in there ,
i might &apos;ve lost myself .
now i have some of what she gave me to give back .
it is 6 : 14 .
that would be my next class about to start .
um , it was nice meeting you .
yeah , you too .
is everything okay ?
your pulse is kind of racing .
no , i just don &apos;t want to miss my train .
sorry . the pulse thing
is another little trick jenna taught me .
she &apos;s full of surprises , that one .
i know .
i think that &apos;s part of what makes her so special .
she &apos;s really good at reading people .
have a good one .
you too .
thanks .
hold on , miss . you need to sign in .
uh , i was just leaving .
you sat . you had coffee .
that makes you a visitor .
what does that sign say ?
all visitors must sign in .
jada ! can you come back here ?
good night .
yeah , thank you . have a good evening .
don &apos;t you have your own fake i.d. ?
we all got new ones together .
it &apos;s for maya .
i look nothing like maya .
you &apos;re 5 &apos; 2 &quot; nd brunette .
so is she .
it &apos;s the best i can do on short notice .
besides , we &apos;re going to the bluebird in camden .
oh , jersey ? yeah , that &apos;ll totally work .
okay , so all the windows and doors are locked .
you can still call mona ,
see if she &apos;ll sleep over .
she &apos;s mad at me , too .
well , maybe caleb will calm down
and come over later . how bad was your fight ?
bad . he thinks lucas needs our help .
well , caleb won &apos;t believe lucas is dangerous
until he knows what lucas did to ali &apos;s memorial .
yeah , well , i can &apos;t spill that
without , like , spilling a million other beans .
meanwhile , i &apos;m home alone
and lucas is out there waiting for me .
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna call holden and cancel .
maybe maya can go with someone else .
no . no , my mom will be home before you and maya leave ,
and , aria , don &apos;t cancel just for me .
you sure ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be fine if someone &apos;s around .
okay .
well , i should probably get going , then .
i &apos;m gonna go upstairs and get changed .
scream if you need me .
you know what i mean .
s.o.s. , okay ?
yeah .
阿瑟 · 米勒名作 《 桥上风景 》
i thought your parents were driving you here .
oh , well , i convinced my mom to drop me off at the corner .
it &apos;s progress .
sounds tough .
what &apos;d you do to bring on the parental wrath ?
it &apos;s a really long story .
brought you something .
oh ! gummy bears ?
yeah , when we were little
you &apos;d always smuggle some into our playdates .
oh , that &apos;s right !
yeah , when your mom was in her no @-@ sugar phase .
my mom &apos;s had a lot of phases .
anyway , i figured i owe you .
oh . thank you .
i &apos;m gonna go grab the tickets .
hi . two for montgomery .
thanks .
um , are there two for fitz ?
oh , no . they &apos;re not mine .
i just thought that my friend would be here by now .
thanks .
look who i found !
oh , mrs. welch . hi .
hi . hey , i didn &apos;t know you kids were arthur miller fans .
you know , a view from the bridge one of my favorites .
what &apos;s it about ?
you &apos;ve never seen it ?
oh , i don &apos;t want to ruin it for you ,
but let &apos;s just say it &apos;s got a lot of misplaced passion .
well , we should probably go find our seats .
hey , ezra , when did you get here ?
spencer ?
h @-@ hi !
how random ! were you just on the train in from the city ?
yeah . i didn &apos;t see you .
i know ! we could &apos;ve sat together .
so , what took you downtown ?
um , just running errands .
i was just doing a little shopping .
a little ?
it was therapeutic .
especially since i can &apos;t get in touch with hanna .
she &apos;s fully awol .
sorry , i haven &apos;t seen her since school .
well , if you see her , could you just ...
you know what , never mind .
do you want me to give her a message ?
it &apos;s no big deal . it &apos;s just ...
noel broke up with me , and ...
i don &apos;t even know why so i hit these amazing sales ,
thinking i could just shop the pain away .
and i bought , like , five cashmere @-@ blend sweater sets .
have you ever seen me in a sweater set ?
no , because i don &apos;t wear sweater sets .
or blends .
i think he broke me .
wait . here .
i know you didn &apos;t ask me ,
but i think that you can raise the bar a little bit .
i know that there are plenty of guys--
do you know how hard i have to work
to get a guy like noel kahn to go out with me ?
well , if you &apos;ve become the mona you want to be ,
why are you letting noel kahn tell you
that you &apos;re not good enough ?
you cannot let him send you spinning backwards like that .
you &apos;re , like , smart smart .
i always thought you were just book smart .
you want a sweater set ? cashmere blend .
um , i &apos;m cool , thanks .
spencer .
thanks .
it &apos;s so nice to see young people enjoying live theater .
most of your peers are
probably watching their youtubes right now .
you &apos;d be surprised to find that some of us
are able to actually connect with the real world .
so , what brings you here ?
uh , oh , a friend of mine had an extra ticket .
holden , you probably missed him while you were abroad ,
but , aria , you remember mr. fitz , don &apos;t you ?
oh . is he here ?
no , i just feel terrible about it .
he had to leave about ten minutes in .
said he didn &apos;t feel well .
caleb , call me back when you get this .
i made you some .
it &apos;s on the counter . take a bath .
is everything okay ?
yeah .
you know where to find me .
hey . it &apos;s me again .
i &apos;m sorry we argued earlier .
now it &apos;s getting dark , and ...
and i &apos;m getting worried .
i just don &apos;t think that you should be
out there by yourself looking for lucas .
so , can you just call me or something
so i can at least know that you &apos;re okay ?
i get it . you &apos;re still mad at me .
just ... can you at least text me ?
hanna , what was that noise ?
uh , just the wind , mom . i think the latch is broken .
what ?
the latch on the back door .
i think we need to fix it .
did you bring an umbrella ?
line &apos;s moving .
just hope it doesn &apos;t rain .
maya ? is someone bothering you ?
do you want me to answer it ?
no , no . i just--
um , i should probably turn my phone off , right ?
emily ...
you don &apos;t have to explain .
whatever it is , just tell me when you &apos;re ready .
i hooked up with someone ...
when i was away .
remember when you called and i was sort of distant ?
yeah . you didn &apos;t want to talk to me .
i was lonely .
it didn &apos;t last very long ,
and i ended it .
you didn &apos;t have to be scared to tell me .
we were apart .
yeah , but i should have said something .
i mean , we promised to get to know each other again ,
and that can &apos;t happen when i &apos;m not telling the truth .
i was scared that telling you
would get in the way of this .
us .
well , it doesn &apos;t have to .
you said it was over , right ?
ugh , it is , but ...
it looks like he won &apos;t take no for an answer .
it &apos;s about to get crazy out here .
you wanna grab a coffee or something ?
oh . yeah . we can do that .
only if you want to .
or ...
maybe you went out with the wrong person tonight .
what ? no . i--
i &apos;m guessing your parents don &apos;t approve .
i saw the way you looked at him before the show ,
and the look on your face when you found out he &apos;d gone .
i &apos;m sorry .
look , when my mom gets here ,
can you not mention this to her ?
aria , we &apos;re not five anymore .
i don &apos;t have to tell your mom anything ,
as long as you promise to do the same .
you &apos;re not the only one who &apos;s got stuff
they wanna keep from their parents .
so , how long have you been seeing each other ?
a while .
hey , i &apos;m so sorry . this ...
this was a mistake .
maybe it &apos;s an opportunity .
you busy next friday ?
hanna !
where did you put my bath salts ?
did you find them by the hand towels ?
found &apos; em !
lucas !
my mom &apos; s down in the hall .
i never wanted to hurt you , hanna .
where &apos;s caleb ?
what did you do to him ?
just listen to me , hanna .
no , no ! don &apos;t come any closer !
hanna .
who &apos;d you just call ?
no one , i swear .
give me the phone and listen to me , hanna !
i can &apos;t let you leave this room .
hanna .
caleb . you &apos;re here .
are you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
lucas , what &apos;s going on ?
where were you ?
i don &apos;t know how emily found out that
it was me on that crisis hotline ,
but i knew that she was going to tell you if i didn &apos;t ,
so i took you out onto the lake
so we could be alone .
i needed your help .
yeah , well , it didn &apos;t seem like that .
probably because i was scared myself .
i was just afraid about how you would react ,
and i need you to soften the blow when i tell caleb .
when you tell me what ?
your money ... is gone .
what money ?
when i left to go visit my mom ,
i left a bunch of cash stashed around .
i asked lucas to put it in his checking account
until i got back . so , wait , all of it ?
and most of mine , too .
how much ?
$ 4,000 .
that &apos;s a lot of money , lucas .
it took me a long time to make that .
it was supposed to be a sure thing .
a sure thing ?
i was just betting on a basketball tournament .
what ? what were you thinking ?
it was just for fun at first ,
a bunch of math and probability stuff ,
seeing if i could figure out a formula to beat the odds .
i was so sure that i would win your money back .
the team got disqualified ,
threw my bracket off .
the payoff never happened .
and then suddenly you were just back from california
and i had lost everything .
is that why you didn &apos;t come back after the lake ?
you were just gonna run away ?
i just want to make things right .
it &apos;s not everything , but it &apos;s ...
where did you get this ?
i was driving around to different comic book stores
here , downstate , and in new jersey .
sold a bunch of my collectibles .
i know it &apos;s not everything , but it &apos;s a start .
i &apos;m really sorry , caleb .
we &apos;ll work it out .
hanna ?
please say something .
you &apos;re not who i thought you were .
so wait , somebody else showed up at the greenhouse
when we set that trap for &quot; a &quot; ?
it wasn &apos;t lucas ?
what about the water bottle ?
and the stunt with the rowboat ?
no , lucas wasn &apos;t even in rosewood .
he was driving around all night trying
to sell his collectibles to pay caleb back .
spence , what did you want to show us ?
oh , yeah .
hey , did you order dumplings ? two orders .
what is this ?
this is the sign @-@ in book from jenna &apos;s blind rehab center .
this is the day before alison went missing .
mm . jenna said that alison came to visit her that day .
i don &apos;t see ali &apos;s name .
wait , so that story she told us , that was a lie ?
well , who knows , but that &apos;s not all .
look who did visit .
garrett reynolds . he was there for ,
like , what , 20 minutes that night ?
and not only do guests have to sign in ,
they also keep track of when the patients leave .
garrett signed jenna out at 10 : 15 p.m.
and there &apos;s no time that they signed back in .
she could &apos;ve been gone all night .
can we just look at this later ?
if i don &apos;t eat something , my head is going to explode .
aria , would you please pass those plates ?
yeah , sure .
jenna said that alison blackmailed her
and that she stayed in rehab until the day of alison &apos;s funeral .
so where was she the night ali went missing ?
she could &apos;ve been anywhere .
how much do you want to bet she was in rosewood ?
oh , my god !
oh , i &apos;m gonna be sick .
&quot; this is what live bait looks like .
