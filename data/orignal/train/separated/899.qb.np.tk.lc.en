back in the &apos; 80s , before you could film
a major motion picture with your phone ,
the only way to capture memories
was with this monstrosity -- the video camera .
it was literally backbreaking work ,
but the result was always priceless .
what &apos;s up , b @-@ ball fans ?
big tasty coming to you live from the drive .
rumor has it you like dunks .
well , i call this one &quot; slam , jam , thank you , ma &apos;am . &quot;
&quot; honey , i dunked the kid . &quot;
&quot; good morning , viet @-@ slam . &quot;
call me jean @-@ claude van jam .
this is the worst thing i &apos;ve ever seen ,
and i see my dad in his underpants every day .
but we &apos;re only halfway through watching my jampilation --
the extrava @-@ jam @-@ za .
yeah , this has been amazing , you know ,
a saturday really well spent ,
but i am gonna go do anything else .
it &apos;s my little love muffin &apos;s birthday !
dude , did you tape over your 5th birthday party ?
that could have been anyone &apos;s parents .
no , i remember that party -- your mom gave me a haircut
&apos;cause she said my mom did a bad job .
oh , no , no , no , no .
yes ! this is wonderful !
for me .
for you , it &apos;s like as bad as it gets .
it &apos;s fine !
mom has millions of tapes of us .
it &apos;s not like she has every one of them memorized .
hi , love nuggets .
oh , your 5th birthday !
oh , i remember every single moment .
we should go .
no , no . stay .
let &apos;s all watch the best time in my life
when you were my little schmoo
and you used to give mama endless huggies .
you heard mama . play the tape .
why watch an old video
when you can get a real huggie right now ?
for real ?
get in here , you .
ohh , ain &apos;t this the best ?
totally .
i can really feel your whole body against mine .
oh , my baby &apos;s so big and squishy .
it was october 7 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and my dad was engaged in his favorite hobby --
watching the weather channel .
back then , there were only five channels to watch .
with the invention of this exciting network ,
dads across america were hooked .
call cousin arnie .
they have a blizzard warning in denver !
they have no idea what they &apos;re up against !
unless it banks south .
then they &apos;ll just have nice , mild flurries .
my knee is acting up .
bet it &apos;s gonna rain .
this guy thinks it &apos;s gonna rain today with 5 % humidity .
i liked you better when you hated everything .
yep , the weather was my dad &apos;s hobby .
and of course , it couldn &apos;t be any more different than mine .
okay , here &apos;s the deal .
you &apos;re looking at a sentient robot named johnny 5
from the hit movie &quot; short circuit &quot;
and the less critically acclaimed &quot; short circuit 2 . &quot;
why is the &quot; robit &quot; lounging on a raft ?
that thing weighs a ton . it makes no sense .
the point is , the hobby shop is selling a limited @-@ edition kit
to build a mini replica johnny 5 and i need money .
you do realize i &apos;m gonna say no , right ?
i do know that , yes .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna call this
a learning @-@ based project and ask you to build it with me .
do not do that . do not call it a learning @-@ based project .
then give me the money .
i won &apos;t involve mom , and we can each go our separate ways .
done . how much ?
$ 96 .
i &apos;m gonna ask you to go away now .
mom , i have a learning @-@ based project
dad won &apos;t get involved in !
what is this about a learning @-@ based project ?
i like the sound of that .
i want to build a robot with dad ,
but he doesn &apos;t want to do it with me .
murray ! it &apos;s a learning @-@ based project !
mama , why won &apos;t he let me learn stuff ?
it &apos;s a learning @-@ based project !
the thing costs 100 bucks .
tell you what -- instead of going to the store
and buying a bunch of robot parts ,
dad will help you build one from junk around the house .
oh , no , what have i done ?
i was literally just sitting here .
no . zip it .
zip it . zip it . i &apos;ve made up my mind .
you two are building a robot , and that &apos;s final !
yay ! learning @-@ based project !
yeah , i &apos;m a putz .
while i was stuck with the grumpiest man on the planet ,
barry went to the smartest man he knew .
coach meller ! coach !
i need your help .
third graders , out !
you &apos;re of no use to me until you develop adult bodies
that can play something besides tag .
what are we looking at here , goldberg ?
i taped over my 5th birthday party !
my mom will never forgive me if i can &apos;t get her tape back .
you &apos;re the a.v. club adviser . help me .
well , it &apos;s more of a ceremonial title .
i just get to keep the key to the a.v. closet on my belt ,
but mostly i just hand the key off
to that weird kid with the muppet voice .
my brother ? - that &apos;s him -- muppet boy .
so is it possible ?
can we un @-@ film what i taped over ?
absolutely .
all we got to do is pop that tape into the vcr ,
hit record and rewind at the same time ,
and it will un @-@ record the top layer of video .
duh !
the answer was in front of me the whole time .
except that wasn &apos;t the answer .
to the nerd hole .
while you could easily tape over something ,
you could never un @-@ erase it .
no ! why didn &apos;t it work ?
&apos;cause nobody really knows how vhs technology works .
it &apos;s a mystery science can &apos;t solve .
looks like your only choice is to come clean .
or i double @-@ down and keep lying .
i lied on a job application once
and said i was proficient in the audio @-@ visual arts .
now here we are .
so the lesson is --
don &apos;t lie .
unless it gets you an extra 60 bucks a week
and a butt @-@ load of extension cords .
i feel good about today .
in my brother &apos;s mind , there was only one logical choice --
frame my mom .
first , he took his ruined birthday tape
and steamed off the label .
next , he stuck it onto my mom &apos;s phil donahue tape
so the next time she &apos;d watch barry &apos;s birthday ,
she &apos;d find this .
i just don &apos;t understand how i could be so careless !
don &apos;t beat yourself up too bad .
i mean , yeah , it &apos;s an unforgivable mistake .
but one day , i &apos;ll recover .
but i won &apos;t !
those were the first moving images of my precious love monkeys .
lost ! forever !
dude , i &apos;m all for lying to our parents ,
but this is very not okay .
the good news is she &apos;ll totally forget about it in a few days .
i will never forget about this !
or a few weeks .
ever .
mom &apos;s a mess .
i &apos;ve failed as a mother ...
i can &apos;t take it , barry .
... as a woman ...
either you tell her ...
... and as a human person
or i will .
this is all your fault , phil donahue ,
you gorgeous white @-@ haired bastard .
okay , brainstorming session .
murray , now that you &apos;ve been forced to build a robo @-@ man ,
you get to delight in adam &apos;s favorite hobby .
i was about to delight in the weather channel .
they got a new ticker at the bottom of the screen .
it &apos;s always moving .
are we done here ?
no !
come on . tell me what this metal @-@ sucker should look like .
get the ball rolling , mur @-@ man .
i don &apos;t know . um ...
it could have a ... button .
good ! a button .
way to go there , big guy . adam , your turn .
it definitely should have a &quot; back to the future &quot; -style
flux capacitor for time travel .
don &apos;t write that down .
no time travel . that &apos;s not a thing .
there are no bad ideas in brainstorming .
what else you got ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe like a pointy hand that could poke stuff .
an ion @-@ based magma cannon .
a hat .
a combat @-@ ready cloaking device .
metal feet .
we should also give it emotions and a sense of humor .
no ! don &apos;t write that down !
ever heard of &quot; short circuit &quot; ?
once we get it struck by lightning ,
it &apos;ll be alive just like johnny 5 .
that was a movie .
for the sake of argument , let &apos;s entertain the notion
that this robot can have anything we want it to have .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do , bro ,
but unless this robot can give fog advisories ,
my father ain &apos;t getting onboard .
a weather &quot; robit . &quot;
now , that actually makes sense .
i want this thing to have a snow plow .
and inter @-@ dimensional portals .
now we &apos;re cooking with gas .
while my dad and i were finally coming together ,
my mom was still falling apart .
dude , look at her .
she &apos;s even lost her will to jazzercise .
you were supposed to tell her by now .
i know , but i have great news .
i came up with something so much better than the truth .
i searched through all our old tapes
and cut together beverly goldberg &apos;s
most awesome moments as a mom .
i call it a &quot; momtage . &quot;
i don &apos;t understand .
see , i took the word &quot; mom &quot;
and mushed it into the word &quot; montage , &quot;
which is spanish for the word &quot; honesty . &quot;
i know what &quot; montage &quot; means .
just tell me how it &apos;ll make her feel better .
simple .
there &apos;s nothing that woman loves more than taking care of us .
when she watches her greatest hits ,
she &apos;ll give me a hug and forget all about the other tape .
momtage !
starring our mama .
chores !
living the dream !
cooking foods !
too hot , but thank you !
unclogging stuff !
it was dad , not me !
giant hair !
fashion icon !
yelling about safety !
we heart beverly !
well ? good stuff , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m going to tell her myself ,
because this will literally send her into madness .
why can &apos;t you trust me that for once i make things better ?
you did it schmoo @-@ barry !
you went on the big potty !
we &apos;ll remember this forever .
no !
that &apos;s why !
because you taped over another priceless memory !
chill !
i can fix this with another momtage .
it had been two days since my dad came aboard
my greatest hobby , and the results were epic !
big news !
i got a tin of rugelach .
you two look like you could use a break .
no breaks . we &apos;re on a roll .
check it out .
here &apos;s our robot in killer cyborg form .
here he is shooting his laser @-@ guided fist .
and here he is using a doppler radar to predict black ice .
can you imagine ? !
now let &apos;s get to work .
on what ?
duh . our robot .
sure , it won &apos;t be easy , but you said you &apos;d tinker .
we can &apos;t build this thing . it &apos;s got a time @-@ travel thingy .
this technology doesn &apos;t even exist !
not with that attitude .
okay , it &apos;s on me .
i should have known better than to encourage
all this &quot; robit &quot; nonsense .
oh , like your hobby &apos;s so great ? the weather . feh .
don &apos;t &quot; feh &quot; the weather . it can make or break us .
just ask those poor bastards down tornado alley .
please .
my robot can defeat any tornado you throw at me .
easy , fellas . have some rugelach .
really ? a category @-@ nine twister versus this tin can ? please !
it &apos;s got nuts and jam ! just take a taste .
you fool .
my robot is made out of indestructible adamantium
and has a drill that can dig into the core of the earth
and change your precious weather patterns .
i should have never agreed to the drill !
i was on the fence about it ,
and now you &apos;re using it against me !
my own son !
just take a taste .
al . enough of your deli cookie , please .
just take a taste !
look , you &apos;re not a little kid anymore .
you got to stop with these toys
and the fantasies and the &quot; robits . &quot;
it &apos;s robot .
why won &apos;t you say it the right way ?
say &quot; robot &quot; !
i am ! &quot; robit &quot; !
ro @-@ bot .
&quot; robit &quot; !
robot !
&quot; robit &quot; !
robot !
it doesn &apos;t matter what you call it .
you need to find a hobby for a kid your age ,
a hobby that &apos;s real .
none of this crap is real !
you think i don &apos;t know what &apos;s not real ?
well , you sure as hell act like it is !
it &apos;s called fun -- to pretend , to imagine ,
to think of things that may be possible one day .
it &apos;s what i do .
hell , i @-@ i &apos;ll go build this robot right now
just to show you anything &apos;s possible .
you &apos;re gonna go invent a time @-@ traveling &quot; robit &quot;
in your room just to spite me ?
yes , and he will walk and talk
and be the father that you could only hope to be .
at this point , i &apos;m very open to a metal man coming down here
and taking some of this off my plate !
good ! &apos; cause it &apos;s done !
no , no , no . again , i &apos;m really into it .
rugelach is a friendship snack .
as i convinced myself to build a robot ,
erica convinced barry to come clean to my mom .
hi , ma . you can unload those groceries by yourself later .
right now , we need to talk .
what &apos;s wrong , squishy ?
first , i &apos;ll kick things off with a gravity @-@ defying dunk
dedicated to my very understanding
and forgiving mother .
i named it &quot; i love you , mama . &quot;
you &apos;re very sweet to cheer me up , honey .
and remember that .
&apos;cause after my dunk , i &apos;m gonna tell you all about
how i taped over my birthday , then framed you ,
and then taped over even more precious stuff .
watch me jam it home !
that &apos;s right , jtp !
get my mom riled up with your infectious energy !
he soars like an angel !
you did it ?
and then made me turn against phil donahue ?
so you lost a few irreplaceable memories ,
but think about what you gained !
an explosive jampilation of my sweetest rim encounters !
you think i &apos;d rather have a video
of you jam @-@ dunking on some low rim ? seriously ?
low ? that &apos;s nba regulation .
it &apos;s not .
i just told you that to make you feel good about yourself .
it &apos;s low , bro .
yeah , thing &apos;s tiny .
that &apos;s not regulation at all .
oh , my god !
i entered the dunk contest at the villanova game next week !
how could you lie to me ? !
because that &apos;s what a good mama does .
shes builds you up
and makes you feel like you can do anything .
i &apos;ve spent the past decade planning to be
a basketball legend and rap star !
now i &apos;m just gonna be some lowly rap mogul ?
that can &apos;t be the life you want for me !
what i want is my old tapes back ,
but that &apos;s not happening , either , is it ?
my life &apos;s a sham .
goodbye , dreams .
as my brother &apos;s dreams were dying ,
i was realizing it really was impossible
to give life to a robot .
hey ! what are the rules ?
don &apos;t come in your room , don &apos;t touch your crap ,
and don &apos;t come in your room to touch your crap .
and right now , you &apos;re breaking all of them . get out .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
but i really need the electrical guts inside this boom box .
for what ? - to build a spite robot that can replace dad --
a nice one that keeps his pants on .
take a seat .
all right , how do i say this ?
it &apos;s time to give up your stupid thing .
what ? no , no , no , no . never .
trust me . i &apos;m talking from experience here .
when i was your age , this was my hobby .
strawberry shortcake . heard of it ?
yeah , they &apos;re those chubby dolls that smell like pie .
put her in your hand and tell me what you smell .
nothing .
exactly .
i smelled her so long and so hard
that all the berry is gone , and you know why ?
because i was playing with these until i was in the 9th grade .
oh , god .
no one liked this girl , adam . no one .
everyone else moved on to real hobbies
like sports and boys and wine coolers ,
and i was still sniffing the straw .
but robots are way cooler than those dolls .
are they , adam ? are they ?
it &apos;s time , dude . move on .
the last thing i wanted
was to be that sad , little geek in the photo .
at that moment , i realized my dad was right .
it was time to give up robots forever .
while barry &apos;s heart was broken
&apos;cause he &apos;d never play in the nba ,
my mom felt even worse
&apos;cause she was the one who broke it .
goodbye , round mound of rebound .
it would have been nice to be your teammate
until i became a franchise player
and you got traded to utah in disgrace .
in that moment , my mom knew that some taped memory
from the past wasn &apos;t as important
as making barry feel good about his future .
and so beverly goldberg did what she does best --
build up her children in an unrealistic way .
barry , wait .
mom , i &apos;m going to school
&apos;cause i actually have to learn stuff now
&apos;cause i &apos;m not getting drafted by the sixers next month .
love bug , just sit down .
there &apos;s something i want you to see .
see , i took the word &quot; schmoo &quot;
and combined it with &quot; compilation . &quot;
mom , don &apos;t bother .
it &apos;s not gonna make anything better .
starring barry goldberg .
fists ...
kara @-@ te power !
jumping stuff !
popping and locking !
i hate this game !
passion !
long showers !
treasure !
adam ! get out ! stop video @-@ t--
hero !
but you forgot to mention my frisbee skills
and how easily i can make friends with horses .
see ?
you &apos;re so much more than basketball , honey .
you are amazingly talented at so many amazing things .
i am good at basically everything .
i just ... couldn &apos;t live with myself
if i knew i took away your dreams .
so ... does this mean you forgive me for ruining your tapes ?
of course .
look , i know it &apos;s crazy how much i love them ,
but they just remind me of a time
when you still needed me .
mom .
look at all the stuff you do for me .
everything i am is because of you .
i &apos;ll always need you .
goodbye , r2 and 3po .
i guess you are not the droids i was looking for .
well , you did it .
he &apos;s giving up all his robots .
i didn &apos;t want that .
i just wanted him to grow up a little bit .
look at him .
he &apos;s watching the damn weather .
he has the rest of his life to be one of us .
why rush him into it ?
oh , damn . i hate when you &apos;re right .
where you going ?
i &apos;m gonna finish a learning @-@ based project .
just as i had given up robots ,
my dad went out and bought me the one i always wanted .
hello , earth boy . it &apos;s me , short circuit .
just go away .
not interested .
but jimmy 5 is alive !
i &apos;m alive !
it &apos;s johnny 5 , and you &apos;re not alive .
you &apos;re a stupid toy .
look . i know what i said .
and i &apos;d never want you to stop with the &quot; robit &quot; stuff
because of me .
it &apos;s fine , dad .
you &apos;re not the only one who said i should move on .
well , they &apos;re wrong .
i like that you got a big imagination
and you like all that crazy time @-@ travel stuff .
you do ?
yeah .
it &apos;s what makes you , you ,
and i wouldn &apos;t want to change that .
maybe a little . you &apos;re a weird kid .
thanks .
so what do you say we take this sucker out
and try and get it struck by lightning ?
bring this &quot; robit &quot; to life .
it &apos;s robot .
and it &apos;s impossible to know when lightning &apos;s gonna strike next .
hey . you got your hobby . i got mine .
and with that ,
my dad and i combined our hobbies
of course , lightning never struck my robot
and jimmy 5 never came alive .
but that night , my dad and i made a memory
that would last a lifetime ,
something we would always have to look back on .
that &apos;s the thing about letting go of the past .
it &apos;s never easy .
and sometimes , we never let go of it at all .
but the amazing thing about life
is that we make new precious memories every single day .
hey , mom .
i was gonna go outside and throw down some monster jams .
maybe you want to come watch ?
i &apos;d love to , baby .
and the memories come when you least expect it .
i have awful news .
do you remember that video of me
playing with my strawberry shortcake dolls when i was little ?
i accidentally taped over it .
erica , how could you ?
i &apos;m sorry . i guess i just messed up like barry did .
yeah , that &apos;s a real shame .
lucky for us , i made a copy .
what ? !
barry !
good morning , blueberry muffin ! you smell delicious today !
oh , why , thank you , cherry cuddler .
do you want to join us at the berry bake shoppe for tea ?
oh , well , i can &apos;t because i have plans
with my boyfriend , david hasselhoff !
so adorable .
you &apos;re so dead !
classic .
so awkward .
i love her so much .
