let me see it .
you understand how this works ?
yeah , i &apos;m being released into the custody of the fbi
under your supervision .
this is a temporary situation .
help me catch the dutchman , we can make it permanent .
the spanish victory bond .
this is the only surviving copy .
except it &apos;s a forgery .
i know who the dutchman is .
curtis hagen .
you are a particular kind of bastard !
fbi , you &apos;re under arrest .
neal .
ellen .
you and your father .
my mom told me he was dead .
but you told me the truth .
he was a dirty cop ,
and he &apos;s not dead .
you grew up in witness protection .
i was 3 when the marshals took us away .
what happened ?
they found a gun with his prints on it .
he killed a cop ?
he confessed .
all the information i &apos;ve found on the others since james &apos; arrest .
your dad told me
that our department is filled with dirty cops .
and he &apos;s right about one thing :
there are dirty cops .
senator terrence pratt .
he &apos;s got to be one of the dirty cops ellen was investigating .
he &apos;s the one .
we found the evidence box .
after all these years .
that box belongs to senator pratt .
where is it ?
where &apos;s what ?
the evidence !
pratt !
put down the gun .
he &apos;s dead .
don &apos;t move .
peter , you have the right to remain silent .
neal , peter &apos;s gun killed pratt .
there &apos;s gunshot residue on peter &apos;s hands .
it doesn &apos;t look good .
what did you do , dad ?
it was self defense .
you &apos;re gonna testify , and you &apos;re gonna clear peter &apos;s name .
i can &apos;t do it .
the irony of this is not lost on me .
this is my fault .
my father is--
you can &apos;t take responsibility for what james did .
he has completely disappeared .
without his confession--
i know .
there was gunshot residue on my hands ,
my prints on the gun ,
and no eye witnesses .
i would &apos;ve arrested me .
justice will prevail .
let &apos;s damn well hope so .
i have some news to cheer you up .
federal prosecutor is dropping charges ?
no , not that good .
diana &apos;s pregnant .
but how ?
she decided to do it on her own .
she &apos;s actually pretty far along .
there &apos;s so much i might miss .
hi , hon .
hi , hon .
i hate for you to see me like this .
what i see is a man who &apos;s gonna come back even stronger .
you &apos;re gonna beat this , peter burke .
you &apos;re gonna come home to me .
i will .
i promise .
neal , it &apos;s been six weeks .
i don &apos;t think i can take another day ,
much less years .
the indictment hearing starts tomorrow .
i know .
but that only decides if he goes to trial .
if he &apos;s indicted ,
even if he &apos;s found innocent ,
he can never serve as an fbi agent again .
i don &apos;t care about his career .
all i care about is getting him out of there .
i understand that , but--
you care .
that &apos;s right . of course .
because his job is what &apos;s keeping you
from joining him in prison .
i &apos;m sorry , neal . it was wrong .
no , it &apos;s okay .
peter cares .
and i can &apos;t be responsible for taking away his badge .
that &apos;s why i want to clear him before the indictment .
get him home to you as soon as possible .
do we have any options ?
we do , but they mostly involve you two
living under new identities in alaska .
anything less nuclear ?
not yet .
well i &apos;ve always wanted to drive a snowmobile to work , so .
do whatever you have to do , okay ?
okay .
i did it !
unless you found a way to get peter out of jail ,
i don &apos;t want to hear about it .
it &apos;s a step in that direction .
i cracked your anklet .
what ?
this fine piece of technology
took nine months
and most of your wine cabinet ,
but because of this ,
the fbi will no longer know where you are .
you spent almost a year working on this ?
it was supposed to be a surprise .
and for us to take a road trip to the jersey shore .
but a prison break is second best .
moz , this is great .
but how are we going to convince peter to break out of prison ?
who says we have to convince him ?
what , are you going to carry him out ?
i don &apos;t have the upper @-@ body strength , sadly .
but we could douse him with devil &apos;s breath .
we are not dousing him with anything .
did you tell anyone we were trying to help peter ?
and admit to assisting a suit ?
my reputation would never recover .
why ?
because i didn &apos;t either .
&quot; i can help burke . opera house . 5 : 00 p.m.
come alone . &quot;
he &apos;s with me .
curtis hagen .
been a long time .
that it has .
and you never sent me a thank you card .
it &apos;s because of me you &apos;re free to walk around manhattan .
that thing around your ankle .
it &apos;s because i caught you .
nevertheless .
i was unable to negotiate the same deal .
so you settled for a work release program .
i thought murderers were a high security risk .
i was never arrested for murder .
only forgery .
it appears that
there &apos;s a demand for world @-@ renowned restorers .
i can work for $ 10 a day ,
even if it does require an armed escort .
are they guarding you ,
or guarding for you ?
bit of both , caffrey .
you know how it goes .
little bribery goes a long way .
not long enough to let you go .
sadly , no .
as you well know .
otherwise you would &apos;ve secured peter burke &apos;s release .
what &apos;s your offer ?
pal up with him in prison ?
protect him ?
that &apos;s not particularly big picture now , is it ?
i know how to make peter burke a free man .
this is a waste of my time .
if there were a way to free peter , i would have found it .
you have a federal prosecutor breathing rather heavily
down peter burke &apos;s neck , do you not ?
we do .
what if i told you i was the reason
he was so very determined
to take peter burke down ?
if you had that kind of pull
i &apos;d ask why you didn &apos;t use him to get yourself out .
would that i could .
sadly he became a federal prosecutor
after i was incarcerated .
i believe my patience has paid off in other ways though .
what do you want ?
i want you to do me a favor .
i need money , soon .
you can afford to bribe guards .
i &apos;m in need of a much bigger sum .
already have a target .
simple little smash and grab .
i &apos;d do it myself , but ...
if you can pull this off ,
we have a deal .
there &apos;s one more thing .
there always is .
federal prosecutor &apos;s gonna need a good reason to step away .
not lose face .
you want me to provide that reason ?
your old man &apos;s confession should do quite nicely .
if i could find my father , peter would already be free .
indeed .
but from one forger to another ,
we both know there are many ways to create another man &apos;s words .
you want me to forge my father &apos;s confession ?
make it good .
i &apos;ll take care of the rest .
so the dutchman appears out of nowhere offering gifts ,
and i &apos;m not suspicious ?
you &apos;re not alone .
but what other choice do we have ?
like i said , we can--
that doesn &apos;t involve a sky hook .
moz , this is the only option we &apos;ve found
that doesn &apos;t have peter on the run .
i can make a believable facsimile of james &apos;s voice ,
there is one catch .
you need as close a voice match as possible .
like father , like son .
there are familial overlaps of cadence and voice
that will be very helpful .
in spite of everything , he &apos;s still my father .
if i record this ,
he &apos;ll be a fugitive for the rest of his life .
neal , james did that all by himself .
you &apos;re offering redemption that he doesn &apos;t deserve .
do you have any recording of him ?
i &apos;ll need it for voice matching .
yeah .
he left me a voicemail right before the con
at the empire state building .
it &apos;s the only thing i have .
hey , i &apos;m running a little late ,
but i &apos;ll be there .
i promise .
see you soon , son .
see you soon , son .
how &apos;d that sound ?
uncomfortably tragic .
i should leave you alone .
no , no . moz , it &apos;s good to have you here .
come on .
peter burke
has been accused of first degree murder ,
in the death of senator terrence pratt .
we are here today to decide
whether to indict him on these charges .
i &apos;d like to testify on my own behalf .
mr. burke--
i want to speak to my history as an agent ,
and to my character .
nothing you say will change my decision .
sit down .
because ,
as i was about to say ,
new evidence has come to light .
my name is james bennett .
i almost let an innocent man take the fall for me ,
but i can &apos;t let that happen .
i shot and killed senator terrence pratt ...
the man who ruined my life ,
using peter burke &apos;s gun .
peter tried to convince me to stay and face justice .
instead , i ran .
the only thing he is guilty of
was trusting i would do the right thing .
unfortunately , this is as close to the right thing
as i can manage .
i hope it &apos;s enough .
we analyzed the recording this morning .
it &apos;s been authenticated as the voice of james bennett .
with this evidence in hand ,
i see no other option than to drop all charges .
mr. burke ,
you are free to go .
good to see you , peter .
mark , thanks .
good to see you , peter .
thanks .
good to have you back in the office , peter .
good to be here , clinton .
thanks .
if you didn &apos;t come back ,
i had dibs on this office .
your feet are on my desk .
welcome back , agent burke .
how &apos;d you do it ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i don &apos;t believe for a second james bennett made that call .
not without his son convincing him .
i don &apos;t know how you found your father ,
or how you got him to leave that message , but ...
thank you .
i can &apos;t admit to an fbi agent
that i consorted with a fugitive .
come on .
hello ?
i do so apologize for interrupting the homecoming .
how rude of me .
but you &apos;re on my clock now .
oh , you &apos;re right .
you fulfilled your end of the bargain .
now it &apos;s my turn .
i missed that squeak .
bruce , come on in . yeah .
come on in .
thought i saw you earlier .
didn &apos;t want to interrupt a moment .
that was one nice moment .
well , fbi section chiefs
have a tendency to stick out in a crowd .
i &apos;m afraid to ask you what you &apos;re doing in new york and ...
and what &apos;s in there , but i &apos;m gonna .
it &apos;s your future , peter .
right , have a seat .
washington ?
i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;ve attracted the attention of some very important people ,
and they see potential in you .
bruce , i just got out of prison .
you took down a corrupt senator .
that alone is a huge accomplishment .
but add your track record to that ...
and now they want me in d.c. ?
not right away .
this is a good office .
it &apos;s a nice space .
but the one next door has a much nicer view ,
and it &apos;s vacant .
the asac &apos;s office ?
they want me to run white collar division ?
consider it a stepping stone to d.c.
i &apos;m flattered . i--
this is all sudden .
i know .
think about it .
yeah .
talk to el .
yeah .
i &apos;ll be around .
thanks , bruce .
hey , boss .
diana .
look at you . i--
how long have i been away ?
not that long .
i kept it quiet as long as i could .
oh , i hope nobody gave you a hard time .
no , everyone &apos;s been great .
i just wanted to stay in the field as long as possible .
but eventually , no amount of loose blouse
was gonna hide this little guy .
little guy ?
yeah , it &apos;s a boy .
uh , you know , i--
i don &apos;t mean to be indelicate , but--
it &apos;s not neal &apos;s .
no , i wasn &apos;t going--
i &apos;m kidding .
oh , you--
no , i went to a clinic .
his father is a world @-@ class chef with one hell of an iq .
good , and his mother is the best damn agent
i ever worked with .
it &apos;s a good combo .
so you gonna take that asac job ?
you heard .
no , i guessed .
that office has been empty for a while
and you would fill it nicely .
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s a big change .
you know , i was scared about
whether i &apos;d be able to balance a career and a baby .
but once i decided , i knew i could do it .
now i &apos;m excited to do it .
change can be good , peter .
tinted varnish treatment ?
you disapprove .
i prefer watercolors for restoration .
it allows any alterations to be reversible .
something to be said for irreversible decisions ,
don &apos;t you think ?
i &apos;m here , aren &apos;t i ?
target .
there &apos;s a vault on the eighth floor of the reinhart building .
what &apos;s inside it ?
coins .
minted from welsh gold .
three times the value of normal gold .
and the only worthwhile thing about the welsh .
get your money a different way .
no .
this is what i want .
i &apos;ve a debt of my own and this is the required form of payment .
in two days .
why so fast ?
because that &apos;s when i need it .
look , i &apos;ve worked under your rather urgent deadline .
are you telling me you can &apos;t get this done under mine ?
magnetic field , motion detectors ,
dual @-@ control combination lock .
we &apos;re gonna go through all of this for pocket change ?
$ 2 million dollars in gold coins
isn &apos;t exactly pocket change .
this building is a fortress , neal .
fortresses have fallen all throughout history .
all it took was someone finding the weak spot .
well , with all that security ,
we better find a way in that
doesn &apos;t involve marching through the front door .
maybe we don &apos;t go through the front door .
what if we pull a back draft ?
i &apos;ve put my inner firebug to bed .
best not to awaken him .
well , there are other ways to bring the fire department to us .
well , even if we could ,
this is not the kind of building that clears easily .
but the building next door is .
they share a wall .
so we get the fire department to clear that ,
we break in and then disappear inside the crowd .
this could work .
you said you cracked the anklet , right ?
yeah .
okay , this device ...
is synced to your anklet .
i flip the switch ,
and that &apos;s it .
the tracker says you &apos;re standing right where you are .
i am standing where i am .
yeah , right now you are .
but this captures the signal and loops it back to the fbi .
so you can walk away .
and it shows me staying right here ?
exactly .
the only catch is that you and your anklet
have to come back here to turn it off .
otherwise , your signal can jump locations suddenly .
they &apos;ll know it was hacked .
nice work , moz .
come in .
got a minute ?
well , always for you , suit .
welcome back , i think .
what ?
you .
barging in here .
trying to figure out if we &apos;re up to something .
it &apos;s nice .
are you up to something ?
see ?
like old times .
can i get you a beer ?
yeah , that would be great . thanks .
i &apos;ve been offered to run the white collar division .
i &apos;m gonna take it .
with everything that happened , i just feel that ...
yeah . yeah , of course .
and there &apos;s a chance that it could lead to more .
in washington .
washington ?
wow , it &apos;s--
congratulations , peter .
yeah , thanks .
i &apos;ve made sure that your deal stays in place .
never would have doubted you .
i &apos;m proud of you , you know .
i &apos;m sure you were tempted to break me out ,
to find a loophole or con someone into getting me free .
but you didn &apos;t .
it says a lot .
justice prevails .
that it did .
i know what you &apos;re thinking and no .
you can &apos;t use this to preach conspiracy theories .
of course .
i will however speak conspiracy truths .
even with the anklet showing me at home
this can &apos;t in any way point back to us .
promise me , moz .
very well .
nothing conspiratorial of any kind .
how depressing .
perfect ! use that .
hey , is that a guy up there ?
i &apos;m gonna jump !
excuse me .
we have an emergency situation here .
if everyone could please evacuate the building
in an orderly manner .
let &apos;s go .
appreciate your cooperation .
shouldn &apos;t be too long .
thank you so much .
don &apos;t move another step !
okay .
i &apos;m only here to talk , that &apos;s all .
you have my word .
why are you doing this ?
that &apos;s a good question .
one i asked myself lately .
have you lost somebody ?
or your job ?
is this about the government ?
about all the secrets that they &apos;re keeping from us ?
of course not !
that would be crazy .
i get a lot of jumpers .
spout off a lot of stuff that sounds crazy ,
and then you think about it a little bit and
it makes you wonder .
if they &apos;re really crazy or not .
i &apos;m just saying that if you have anything
that you want to say to me ,
i &apos;m here to listen .
this one guy told me
that the vatican had evidence of alien life .
how far @-@ fetched .
the world &apos;s most secretive organization
keeping alien technology for their own gain .
yeah , i suppose you &apos;re right .
what about the kennedy assassinations ?
i can &apos;t take this anymore !
i &apos;m gonna jump !
i thought we were having a conversation .
relax , man .
conspiracy theories are not real .
okay .
okay , buddy .
i believe you .
i misread you ,
and i &apos;m sorry .
so why are you here ?
oh , why do you think ?
because somebody hurt you .
let &apos;s go with that .
okay , bye .
okay , hold on .
you &apos;re gonna have to be held in psychiatric custody .
72 @-@ hour hold for your own protection .
all right , i &apos;ll take him down to the sergeant on duty .
all right , don &apos;t take your eyes off of him .
i won &apos;t .
come on , quicker , quicker , quicker .
i need to take the tanks .
it &apos;s time to load up the equipment .
yeah , i &apos;ll take care of them , all right ?
come on , you know the rules .
the lieutenant &apos;s watching .
look--
thank you .
this is heavy .
did i miss something ?
why &apos;d you just give away our gold ?
they would &apos;ve seen my face .
i &apos;ll grab the coins once the lieutenant &apos;s back is turned .
i think his back is now turned .
so out of the frying pan , into the firehouse .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
well the good news is that the tanks
look just like all the other ones .
the one with the gold in it will be a little heavier .
it &apos;ll pass a cursory examination , but not much else .
even with this uniform , if i step foot in there ,
they &apos;ll know i &apos;m not one of them .
so the direct approach is out .
yep .
hey , we can wait until the fire truck takes another call .
if the tanks weren &apos;t used , they &apos;ll still be on the truck .
yeah , i can grab them ...
while they &apos;re dealing with their emergency .
that &apos;ll have to be the plan .
peter &apos;s calling me in .
all right , i &apos;ll set up camp outside the station .
as soon as i can get away , i &apos;ll meet you .
we &apos;ve got a case .
we ?
aren &apos;t you asac now ?
paper work goes through next week .
today , i &apos;m a field agent with a bad guy to catch .
one last case .
what is it ?
please don &apos;t say mortgage fraud .
gold coins .
$ 1.8 million worth of them .
stolen from a private vault .
sounds like a good one to end on , doesn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
feels about right .
lucky for us ,
lots of people recorded today &apos;s jumper .
unluckily , we still haven &apos;t been able to get a clear shot of him .
we &apos;re pretty sure , however ,
that he was a distraction for this .
our thieves broke into a travel agency
in order to burrow into the building next door .
that way they evaded the security system of the building
and got away with the gold .
it &apos;s a back draft .
a back draft ?
set a jumper , call the fire department ,
they &apos;ll clear out the building
and you can steal whatever you want
while they watch the show .
well , whoever he was ,
he slipped away before anyone could properly i.d. him .
and he was high up enough
that no one in the crowd could get a clear picture of him .
he &apos;s just the distraction .
it &apos;s the guy who grabbed the loot that you need to catch .
i agree , but we don &apos;t have eyes on him yet either .
how would you go in ?
i &apos;d go into the travel agency posing as a vacationer .
go out with everyone to watch the jumper ,
then double back .
once i grabbed the coins , i &apos;d change clothes
and blend in with the crowd .
what about the equipment to get through the vault ?
he could dress as a businessman ,
carry it in a briefcase .
pause the video .
what are you thinking ?
what if the thief had the equipment with him
the entire time ?
go back about seven seconds .
there .
why carry a pair of compressed air tanks
if there isn &apos;t a fire ?
he could fit an acetylene torch in one
and stash the gold in the other .
comb through the footage .
let &apos;s see if we can put a face on this guy .
jones , find out which fire department responded .
you think this was an inside job ?
i &apos;m leaning towards an impersonator ,
but either way , the firehouse , that &apos;s our best lead .
are you en route to the firehouse ?
i &apos;m about to be .
unfortunately , so is peter .
that &apos;s an odd choice of strategy .
he &apos;s investigating the coin heist
and he &apos;s already traced it to the firehouse .
well , the suit is more than welcome to check it out .
but the fire truck we need will be elsewhere .
what did you do , moz ?
oh , relax .
my inner firebug is well under control .
all right , good work .
we found our firehouse . you coming ?
sure .
great .
are we stealing this ?
oh , they called it a promotion for the asac job .
should have held out for a private jet .
one promotion at a time .
oh , you gonna slide down the pole ?
no !
but you &apos;re tempted .
yeah .
all right , i &apos;ll be in in a minute .
all right .
how &apos;d it go ?
empty @-@ handedly .
they must have unloaded the tanks at the station .
you need to stall the suit .
the suit is currently in the station .
then he &apos;s about to hit the jackpot .
all right , head this way . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
she &apos;s a beaut , isn &apos;t she ?
peter burke , fbi .
this is my consultant , neal caffrey .
it &apos;s gannon .
your office told me you &apos;d be coming .
first off , my guys are legit .
oh , i &apos;m sure they are .
we believe the man we &apos;re looking for
was impersonating a member of your company .
so what do you have on him ?
not much .
he &apos;s roughly 6 @-@ feet tall .
solid build .
well , that really narrows the field .
where are your men ?
out on a call .
just me and the kid .
hey , probie .
forget the boots ,
guys are gonna be hungry when they get back .
fire up those burners .
i &apos;m curious about some of your equipment .
your compressed air tanks in particular .
tanks are upstairs .
but without a warrant and all that ,
you know , i got to cover my--
legal bases . i understand .
well , is there anyone peter could call ?
sure , we could phone my supervisor .
that &apos;d be great .
grease fire ?
probie , you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
no , no , no . hold on . hold on .
it &apos;s his first fire . let &apos;s see how he handles it .
moz , i got them .
come to the back of the building .
second floor window .
okay , throw me the tank .
the tanks won &apos;t fit out the window .
well , tossing handfuls of coins at me
isn &apos;t gonna do us much good .
hold on a second .
that &apos;s what i get for hiring my sister &apos;s kid .
sorry .
jackpot .
well , hopefully for your second fire
you won &apos;t start it yourself .
sorry about your jacket .
we &apos;ll have to figure out a way to replace it .
no , no , no . that &apos;s all right .
my--my wife &apos;s been trying to get rid of it for years .
she &apos;ll be happy .
right , neal ?
neal ?
hey , i found these .
you &apos;re late .
fire &apos;s out .
what happened to your jacket ?
you &apos;re breathing it .
let &apos;s look at these tanks .
marc chagall was smuggled out of nazi occupied france
with a forged visa provided by this country
and brought to new york .
an innocent man was set free by illegal means , i get it .
this is the address and unit number of a secure drop site .
the key &apos;s inside as well .
what &apos;s the gold for , hagen ?
why &apos;s that matter to you ?
because i can tell when i &apos;ve stepped into a trap .
you lied about having a debt to pay .
i think the gold was used to bribe the federal prosecutor
on peter &apos;s case .
well , if that &apos;s true , that would be very kind of me .
you gave me a target with only one approach
in the time provided-- through the travel agency .
you figured out what i want yet ?
me .
where were the cameras hidden ?
well , one was up in the corner .
but i really feel this one best captures the moment .
love the fireman &apos;s uniform .
it adds a little color to the blackmail .
what do you want ?
my appeal &apos;s coming up .
you &apos;re gonna help set me free .
so on top of your new , yet @-@ to @-@ be @-@ determined fbi handler
you now have a criminal handler to deal with ?
look , we both knew what i was getting into .
and it &apos;s worth it to get peter back .
if hagen has a federal prosecutor in his pocket ,
why does he need you ?
all the prosecutor can do is force the case back to appeal .
we have to make sure the appeal goes through .
i &apos;ve defended worse people in court .
he &apos;s not looking for a lawyer , moz .
there &apos;s evidence at the fbi .
bonds that hagen forged back when peter and i caught him .
he wants us to destroy them .
out of the firehouse and back into the frying pan .
what you looking at ?
neal caffrey standing still .
mm . that happens ?
happened four straight hours yesterday .
right smack dab in the middle of the room .
well , maybe he was meditating .
or changing a very @-@ hard @-@ to @-@ reach light bulb .
that &apos;s some light bulb .
my question is whether neal was ever there to begin with .
he could go off anklet without you knowing ?
isn &apos;t that impossible ?
impossible is what neal caffrey specializes in .
he knew i was facing jail ,
and that if i was found guilty ,
he &apos;d be heading back as well .
i &apos;d imagine
he focused a lot of time at cracking that anklet .
yeah , but if he succeeded and you got out anyways ...
he suddenly has a
get @-@ away @-@ from @-@ handler free card .
where is this all coming from ?
we found the air tanks that had the coins
at the fire station
empty .
there was a moment when neal was alone with them .
it didn &apos;t feel right .
you think neal had something to do with the coin heist ?
i don &apos;t know .
neal doesn &apos;t steal without a reason .
and i can &apos;t think of a single reason why he would do this .
it keeps nagging at me .
okay . you &apos;re doing it again .
you &apos;re getting emotionally invested .
this is the reason you landed yourself in jail .
you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s time for a change .
come in .
what time is it ?
you been working a while ?
ah , you know how it is when you &apos;re painting .
you get into a zone .
can &apos;t say i do .
my job is all about perspective .
being able to look at a situation
and evaluate all the angles .
i realize i can &apos;t do that anymore .
what are you talking about ?
jones and diana ,
everyone in the white collar offices ,
we &apos;re all family and ...
you &apos;re a part of that family .
you &apos;re also a criminal .
i forget that a lot .
and until you &apos;ve served out your sentence ,
that &apos;s exactly what you are .
i &apos;ve made mistakes because i let emotions cloud my judgment ,
and i can &apos;t let my next handler make those same mistakes .
you &apos;re choosing someone from outside the office
to be my new handler .
someone with the right perspective .
someone who will see you as you are .
a criminal .
this is in your best interest .
could have sworn the other day
you told me how proud of me you were .
i am . i--
i am .
neal .
i can &apos;t risk you going back .
i don &apos;t like this any more than you do .
but it &apos;s the way it has to be .
do i want to know what &apos;s in the box ?
got a new anklet in .
any particular reason ?
felt it was time for an upgrade .
this is an all @-@ new one with a new chip set .
looks the same on the outside .
i think there &apos;s a metaphor there somewhere .
you know , it &apos;s scary .
what &apos;s that ?
feel strange when it &apos;s not on .
like i &apos;m missing something .
that &apos;s how used to i &apos;ve gotten .
see you tomorrow .
goodbye , peter .
