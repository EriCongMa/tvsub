sara , why you helping out ?
i like the mystery .
is that all ?
moz , i know who &apos;s behind everything .
vincent adler .
he &apos;s rained hell down on both our lives .
i &apos;m trying to reconcile the adler i knew
with the man responsible for --
for kate ?
for mozzie ?
yeah .
so let &apos;s get him .
i caught you when i found out what you wanted most .
we know what he wants most .
it &apos;s a fractal antenna .
and this shape corresponds to an emergency beacon .
you &apos;re telling me that if we build a real one of these --
it &apos;s gonna lead us to a boat or a plane
or something that disappeared in the 1940s .
something worth killing two people ?
it &apos;s worth it to adler .
uh , hold on a second .
isn &apos;t there a probie who would &apos;ve benefited more
from lugging evidence around ?
hmm , carrying evidence
isn &apos;t considered valuable field experience .
for anyone .
i &apos;m sure you never complained
when you were hauling around plasma cutters and borescopes .
when i &apos;m cracking safes , i have a sense of purpose .
had . had a sense of purpose .
now you have a new purpose --
lugging these rolex knock @-@ offs to evidence .
we &apos;re almost there .
thank you .
careful .
sara .
did you ... find something interesting ?
on your desk ? no .
in the ocean , yes .
this is big , guys .
i &apos;ll get the team together in the conference room .
can i talk to neal first ?
thank you .
oh . i &apos;ll meet you up there .
all right .
so ...
yeah .
you look well .
thank you .
you too .
did you change your hair ?
no .
i like it .
it &apos;s got this ...
yeah .
all right , look , before everybody else gets here ,
i just want to say
that if we &apos;re gonna continue working together ,
then we really should not ignore the other night .
look , it was --
hot .
hot ?
i mean , i thought so , but --
no , i know .
the stacks with no ac --
it was like being back in college .
neal , you didn &apos;t go to college .
well , i wasn &apos;t enrolled ,
but i did spend a lot of time ... researching .
speaking of research , take a look at this .
ah , more &quot; faux @-@ lex &quot; watches ?
yeah .
these are the nice ones .
our fence in alphabet city is trying to move 120 boxes ,
each box with 35 of these .
at $ 600 apiece , that &apos;s --
it &apos;s $ 2.5 million street value .
oh , you &apos;ve been sitting too close to caffrey .
when did that happen ?
i don &apos;t know .
diana , round up the harvard crew .
jones , take this box to evidence .
okay , people .
what we have today is a chance to take down
one of the most notorious white @-@ collar criminals
in new york --
vincent adler .
as you know , adler ran a ponzi scheme
about a half a decade ago that rivaled bernie madoff &apos;s .
被认为是规模最大的一次
when it folded ,
he disappeared with a billion dollars .
he &apos;s also my former boss .
sara ellis , from sterling bosch ,
has come up with a fresh lead .
adler is looking for a sunken u @-@ boat off the new york coast .
first music boxes , now u @-@ boats .
sara ?
this is u @-@ boat 869 .
it was launched from germany in 1945 .
what makes this thing so valuable ?
we don &apos;t know .
germany sent out a number of u @-@ boats
towards the end of the war .
their contents were unknown .
whatever &apos;s in this , one person &apos;s been shot ,
and at least two people are dead because of it .
adler wants this sub ,
which means we can use it to find him .
if he &apos;s looking for this thing off the new york coast ,
then he &apos;s using boats .
he &apos;s renting sonars and submersibles .
there &apos;s a paper trail here .
let &apos;s track him down .
diana . jones .
there is another lead i need to you to find .
alex hunter .
she &apos;s an old acquaintance of neal &apos;s .
but you already know that .
we &apos;re already familiar with alex .
how &apos;s she involved ?
there &apos;s a lot she may know about all of this .
find her .
so ... alex ?
okay , calling her an &quot; acquaintance &quot;
may have been an understatement .
neal , you don &apos;t owe me anything .
i &apos;ve lived a life , too .
but if there is anything between us
then don &apos;t lie to me .
i would never .
yes , you would .
so alex ?
over .
a long time ago .
was that so hard ?
no .
lunch tomorrow ?
my place ?
see you at 1 : 00 .
a sunken u @-@ boat ?
what could be better than this ?
what do you think &apos;s in it ?
ah , that is the question , isn &apos;t it ?
plutonium would be an educated guess .
you know they had the bomb years before we did .
guess i missed that chapter in world history .
yeah , of course you did .
it could also contain hitler clones .
is he serious ?
unfortunately , yes .
mozzie , the antenna ?
hold on . it &apos;s got to warm up .
another possibility --
let it be a surprise .
the chrysler building . that &apos;s new .
almost finished .
painting it for your girlfriend ?
are you 9 ?
i &apos;m keeping up my technique . it calms the nerves .
you must paint a lot , then .
i &apos;ve filled a whole storage room .
no .
how close do we have to be for this thing to work ?
oh , the sos signal on the u @-@ boat
was designed to go into a passive mode ,
which means we &apos;d have to be right on top of it
in order to detect it .
i don &apos;t relish hauling you and that thing
up and down the eastern seaboard .
if alex knows as much as we think she does about this thing ,
could she help us narrow down our search area ?
it &apos;s worth a shot .
i haven &apos;t gotten through on her number , but i &apos;ll try again .
alex ?
hello , neal .
adler .
after all this time , you recognized my voice .
i &apos;m flattered .
where &apos;s alex ?
the lady doesn &apos;t want to be disturbed .
i know about the u @-@ boat .
i &apos;d be disappointed if you didn &apos;t .
call off your dog .
let it go .
i can &apos;t do that .
after all you &apos;ve lost -- first kate , now alex .
why keep doing this to yourself ?
i &apos;m not gonna stop , vincent .
neither am i.
any chance that alex and alder are working together ?
no . she would never work with him .
we can &apos;t make any definitive statement
about their relationship at this point .
we find alex hunter , we find vincent adler .
diana .
i ran her aliases by interpol .
checking the local fences .
neal ?
already on it .
all right , did you find anything on alex ?
she &apos;s moved around a lot .
according to hale , she was in town two weeks ago ,
trying to pawn off some more silver through teddy eames .
what &apos;s she doing mixed up with eames ?
he &apos;s a small @-@ time grifter .
yeah , one trying to move up in the world .
alex isn &apos;t known for her altruism .
oh , look , are you really trying to understand alex
at this late date ?
i &apos;ve never understood her .
oh , really ?
i thought your relationship made perfect sense --
mutual respect , convenience .
convenience ?
correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
i want to talk to eames .
you &apos;re positive alex met with him ?
definitely .
eames was the last person to see her before she disappeared .
he might be able to tell us where she was headed .
larceny , possession , robbery --
he &apos;s got quite a hefty rap sheet .
i can lean on him .
he &apos;s not gonna chat up a fed .
what , you gonna scam info out of him ?
eames likes selling hot merchandise ,
anything from stolen plasma screens to borrowed jewelry .
borrowed jewelry , huh ?
now that you mention it , we do have that box of faux @-@ lexes .
look , this better work .
relax .
look , i &apos;m holding five fake rolexes .
if i get shaken down ,
i &apos;ve got a government @-@ stamped barcode
on the back of my neck .
caffrey . what can i do for you ?
i hear you &apos;re moving up in the world .
usually i &apos;d bring this business to alex , but i can &apos;t find her .
well , i would check the interpol website .
apparently , she &apos;s all over it .
okay , are we gonna do this or what ?
what do you got ? - high @-@ quality goods --
micro @-@ etched crystal , correct second @-@ hand movement ,
last purchaser &apos;s credit @-@ card slip .
how much ?
$ 300 each .
$ 200 .
come on , you &apos;ll flip these for at least $ 600 .
all right .
if i sell this one today ,
i &apos;ll buy as many as you got tomorrow .
sounds like a square deal .
hey ! grab him .
oh , nuts !
get back here ! i know a drop when i see one .
you mind emptying your pockets ?
you got probable cause ?
yeah , my badge gives me probable cause .
hands on the table .
what are you doing hassling us ?
shouldn &apos;t you be arresting stock brokers or something ?
i &apos;ll arrest who i want .
all right , your turn .
happy ?
yeah .
all right , i want you to
pack up and get out of here in five minutes .
you understand ?
you ?
so i guess i owe you one . is that right ?
i &apos;d say so .
tell me about the last time you saw alex .
eames said alex was headed to the conservatory garden
after she met with him .
jones , check traffic cams for the garden .
see if we can spot her .
you got it .
watches ?
oh .
money ?
what money ?
the $ 300 eames gave you .
what $ 300 eames gave me ?
thanks for the help .
anytime , serpico .
buy junes lunch .
we &apos;ll see .
security tapes show her arriving
and walking into the garden .
if she came out ,
it was on a side not covered by a camera .
any idea what she was doing here ?
eames wouldn &apos;t say .
it &apos;s a good place for a meeting or a drop .
well , retracing her steps may tell us something .
you take the left , i &apos;ll take the right .
we can meet in the middle .
neal !
neal ? !
who is this ?
hello , agent burke . nice day , isn &apos;t it ?
adler .
where are you ?
holster the gun and get in the car .
hand over your gun , please .
nice to meet you , peter .
save it .
and neal .
i can &apos;t tell you how good it is to see you again .
i &apos;d be lying if i said the same .
you killed kate .
no , neal . you did .
you changed her .
the kate i knew would still be alive .
where &apos;s alex ?
you can ask her when you see her .
what do you want with us ?
i want neal .
but i &apos;ll bring you along since i can &apos;t let you go .
peter , you &apos;ve got a key to neal &apos;s anklet .
give it to him .
neal , take off your anklet .
a decision --
in those glasses is a combination
of chloral hydrate , ethanol , and iced tea .
it &apos;ll put you out until we get where we &apos;re going .
or ?
or you can take another route .
we don &apos;t do this .
have a drink , neal .
you may wake up
to find all the answers you &apos;ve been looking for .
we &apos;re not playing this game .
your turn , agent burke .
alex .
i was looking for you .
should i ?
i think it &apos;ll help .
thank you .
come on .
this is part of a plan , right ?
you let yourselves get caught ,
then the fbi rides to the rescue .
you got the first part right .
you have any idea where we are ?
it &apos;s a warehouse . that &apos;s all i know .
they drugged me , too .
glad you &apos;re awake .
why are we here ?
better if i show you .
my god .
you found it .
incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
the last days of the war .
this u @-@ boat was supposed to reach argentina ,
but something happened .
the crew had to scuttle it off our coast .
they were gonna retrieve it after the war ,
but , obviously , that never happened .
how do you know this ?
because one of the crewmen survived .
he was my father .
why do you need me ?
the crew rigged the interior with explosives
to prevent enemy access .
i need someone who can open it
without setting the charges off .
luckily , i already know the best .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , neal .
and if i refuse ?
you won &apos;t .
alex will be with me .
you can pretend you &apos;re doing it to protect her and peter ,
but we both know the real reason --
you want to see what &apos;s inside .
i &apos;ll need equipment --
carbide @-@ tipped drill , fiber @-@ optic borescope .
i think you &apos;ll find everything you need .
getting the hatch open is a two @-@ man job .
you gonna help me ?
no .
i will be behind blast @-@ proof glass .
agent burke can help you .
keep in mind , you &apos;ll be wearing a remote camera .
don &apos;t try and play a hero .
can you do this ?
neal ? !
not neal .
and you &apos;re not a strawberry blonde
with a penchant for voltaire .
i guess we &apos;re both disappointed .
thought you already had
that up and running .
it is up and running .
i &apos;m trying to boost the reception
because i have yet to receive a signal
or hear from the suit about a boat .
are you gonna loom there all day ?
i &apos;m not looming . neal told me to meet him here .
you know ...
it &apos;s not gonna work out .
what ? getting involved with a con man .
no , no . i am not involved with anybody .
i get it . we &apos;re fascinating creatures .
we live a life of danger .
it &apos;s exciting , slightly erotic .
but with guys like us ,
you find yourself always trying to stay a step ahead .
you relax once , let down your guard ,
and it all goes away .
you paint a very tragic picture .
ah . one person &apos;s tragedy is another person &apos;s excitement .
i &apos;m afraid i drank all the lafite .
oh , all of it
except for this bottle you hid behind all the others .
hmm . there might be some hope for you yet .
did you say you were meeting neal here ?
at 1 : 00 .
that was , like , half an hour ago .
oh , sue me , mozzie . i &apos;m late .
yeah . neal &apos;s usually not .
did you try his cell ?
it went straight to voicemail .
it &apos;s probably nothing .
yeah , it &apos;s nothing .
we should call the suit .
i &apos;m gonna call peter .
you ever safe @-@ crack a submarine ?
no . but the principles should be the same .
what do we got ?
looks like a typewriter .
a typewriter ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t see any explosives .
all right .
help me get these bolts off .
this really a two @-@ man job ?
i figured i &apos;d save you from a bullet .
by putting me in front of a bomb ?
stop talking .
if you don &apos;t like it , come do it yourself .
that shut him up .
here we go .
it &apos;s an enigma .
code @-@ breaking machine .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s wired to blow up .
careful .
that would be tnt .
yeah . a lot of tnt .
no answer from peter or neal .
this isn &apos;t like either of them .
good thing is your boyfriend is wearing a tracking anklet .
will you let it go ? he &apos;s not my boyfriend .
strange . peter took off neal &apos;s anklet .
it &apos;s the conservatory garden .
that &apos;s the same place alex hunter was last seen .
we &apos;ll check it out .
sara , you spoke to neal last .
i want you with us .
okay , we &apos;re still at neal &apos;s ,
so you can just pick us up on your way .
wait , &quot; we &quot; ?
all right , the enigma uses a series of pins and rotors
to encode words .
15 billion @-@ billion possible combinations .
yes . thank you for that .
you &apos;re good with crosswords .
not that good .
you have a favorite color ?
oh , funny . this is your skill set , not mine .
all right , beige is usually a neutral or bluff wire .
usually ?
i don &apos;t know if they bluffed with wire 60 years ago .
the live ones should be the silver or the black .
el &apos;s favorite color is purple .
that doesn &apos;t help .
i think it &apos;s the black .
okay .
or the silver .
or both .
all right , if we cut &apos; em both , that would work .
should work .
i &apos;ll cut the black , you cut the silver .
good . good .
1 , 2 , 3 , clip .
okay .
wait , peter .
in case this doesn &apos;t work ...
yeah . me too .
all right .
1 ...
... 2 ...
3 .
what &apos;s it doing ?
i think it &apos;s a timer .
how much time do we have ?
i don &apos;t know , but it sounds like it &apos;s moving fast .
how do we stop it ? !
i don &apos;t know , peter !
it &apos;s gonna blow .
oh , my god . now i get it .
i know what it is .
what are you talking about ?
it &apos;s a legend .
the enigma password is a legend --
the story of an ancient king
with a golden touch that destroyed him .
midas . alex , are you sure ?
the radio operator who received the u @-@ boat &apos;s final sos signal
was my grandfather .
you &apos;re gerhard wagner &apos;s granddaughter .
he told me to always remember the story .
do it !
midas .
m @-@ i @-@ d @-@ a @-@ s.
that was close .
we &apos;ve cut it closer .
i don &apos;t think so .
all right .
you got it ?
careful .
more tnt . great .
this better be good .
i should have known you &apos;d be lurking .
nice gadget , mr. wizard .
yes , it is .
if you think i &apos;m getting into that thing with two feds ,
then you &apos;re certifiable .
fine . then you &apos;re not coming .
remember , i travel delicately .
mm . perfect .
tools .
if i see jars of fetuses with little black mustaches ,
i &apos;m turning around .
i don &apos;t think this is the one carrying the hitler clones .
here , watch for trip wires .
give me a hand .
yeah .
it &apos;s a van dyke .
it &apos;s got to be worth millions .
look at this .
it &apos;s nazi plunder ...
from all over europe .
priam &apos;s treasure ...
before it turned out to be troy &apos;s treasure .
either way , it &apos;s here now .
this has got to be worth --
billions .
billions of dollars .
this has to be one of the greatest collections of art
that &apos;s ever been found .
how do we get out of here ?
adler , you seeing this ?
yes .
not anymore .
that bought us some time . you got an idea ?
adler could &apos;ve only found this sub
if the antenna was still working .
mozzie &apos;s antenna .
obviously , adler got his to work .
i &apos;ll check over here .
all right .
careful . that nitro &apos;s unstable .
all right .
that looks like our fractal .
bingo .
germans built things to last .
you think mozzie can find us ?
if we can get back to the limo ,
i can connect it to a power source .
it &apos;s a long shot .
well done , gentlemen .
a treasure for the ages .
i &apos;m glad you lived long enough to see it .
my god , that &apos;s a rembrandt .
we &apos;ll take it from here .
you three are going for a ride .
no .
i &apos;m not going back in that limo .
alex !
go ahead , vincent . shoot us .
okay . shoot them .
then get a mop or something .
hold on . okay .
we &apos;ll get in the limo .
there you go . there &apos;s a reasonable man .
get the drinks ready .
i &apos;m not comfortable with this .
we know .
we &apos;re not abducting you .
can i get out ?
no .
well , then it feels like an abduction .
does anyone have anything for motion sickness ?
i don &apos;t know why , but i do like you .
and i don &apos;t want them to hurt you ,
so just do yourself a favor and shut up .
oh , guys !
she &apos;s right . i will hurt you .
all due respect , i think you should listen to me right now .
really ? why is that ?
i &apos;m getting a signal .
is it the sub ?
i don &apos;t think so &apos; cause it &apos;s moving .
which way ?
east !
everyone all right ?
for the moment .
where are we ?
in a dry dock .
what are those guys doing ?
i got a pretty good idea .
adler &apos;s taking the whole arch villain thing pretty seriously .
he always had a flair for the theatrical .
where &apos;s the cavalry , neal ?
moz will be here .
i hope .
which way ?
uh , make a left .
no , i @-@ i mean right !
okay , you said left .
well , this time i mean right !
i @-@ i think .
christ ! left or right ?
uh ... uh , diagonal !
we need to find a way out of these zip ties .
i &apos;ve got a knife .
can &apos;t say i &apos;m surprised .
the guards searched us .
not everywhere .
just like old times .
yep . got it .
damn .
get down ! get down !
get behind me . go .
fbi ! don &apos;t move !
lower your weapons ! put your hands on your head !
don &apos;t think we could have cut it any closer than that .
you saved me again .
you saved me .
anything ?
no . adler &apos;s men aren &apos;t talking .
it &apos;s safe to assume he knows we &apos;ve escaped
and that we &apos;re looking for him .
is he accelerating his escape plan ?
no .
i overheard him say
he &apos;s shipping the art to europe by boat ,
but he can &apos;t until the end of the week .
good .
that gives us some breathing room .
what do you remember about the warehouse ?
wooden beams , pre @-@ war architecture ,
solid steel roll @-@ up door facing west .
that would be the loading bay .
and there was clanging at night . some kind of buoy , i think .
could be a weather buoy .
diana , what do you have ?
there are four along the brooklyn shoreline
and three near battery park .
that &apos;s a lot of real estate .
yeah , let &apos;s get some building plans ,
see if we can narrow it down .
adler got that sub out of the water somehow .
pull satellite . let &apos;s find this thing .
thank you , everybody .
all right , i &apos;m gonna catch a ride to the waterfront .
no , you &apos;re not .
we got good people on it .
you &apos;re gonna finish up and then get out of here .
i need you rested . that &apos;s an order .
you gonna take your own advice ?
yes .
i &apos;m gonna go home , kiss my wife ,
and do at least one normal thing today .
live to fight another day , huh ?
bunch of feds breathing down your neck --
probably not your idea of fun , huh ?
it beats being held hostage .
just barely .
we haven &apos;t been officially introduced .
i &apos;m sara ellis .
alex .
hi .
you &apos;re not a fed ?
no , no .
uh , i work with sterling bosch .
insurance .
mm @-@ hmm .
how &apos;d you get wrapped up in all this ?
psst , psst !
across the room .
danger .
so which one you going for ?
i mean , i &apos;ll be your wing man .
no , i &apos;m good , jones .
you sure ?
if i &apos;m not out in 10 minutes , send backup .
sara . alex .
what are you two talking about ?
i should let you two catch up .
i think she &apos;s great .
it &apos;s not like that . it &apos;s ...
yeah . yeah , it is .
how long have you known about the sub ?
changing the subject ?
no .
maybe .
i want to know .
you know who my grandfather was ?
yeah , wagner .
i &apos;ve known about the sub since i was a little girl .
grandpa , he &apos;d take me to coney island
when no one else was around ,
and he &apos;d point out to the water
and tell me that the greatest treasure in the world
was right out there , just below the waves .
the u @-@ boat .
yes .
he said the nazis collected
the most beautiful things in the world .
they put those things in a submarine ,
and when it was crossing the atlantic ,
it went down , and no one could find it .
he received the final s.o.s. signal from the sub .
yeah .
he encoded the s.o.s. antenna design into the music box .
he figured he &apos;d come to america ,
he &apos;d build a receiver , and he &apos;d find the sub .
but he fled germany after the war ,
and the box was lost .
but he kept this .
yeah .
i always thought they were just wonderful stories ...
about treasure that was just out of reach .
and then on his death bed ,
he told me , &quot; it &apos;s all true , alex . &quot;
and then he proved it .
he gave me the key to the music box .
&quot; find it , &quot; he said .
your new destiny .
you remind me of this treasure .
some wonderful fantasy that &apos;s just out of reach .
take care of yourself , neal .
hell of a day .
another day , another nazi sub .
elizabeth .
hey , honey . everything is fine .
no , i &apos;ll tell you all about it .
i just gave my statement , so i &apos;m gonna go home .
listen ... what happened with alex was not --
neal , stop it , all right ?
i &apos;m a big girl ,
and we need to stop kidding ourselves .
we are who we are .
and ...
hey , there . it &apos;s your lucky night .
elizabeth &apos;s making those little chickens you like .
cornish hens .
i know what they &apos;re called .
you &apos;re invited . that means you &apos;re coming .
both of you .
is that an order ?
yeah . yeah , this will be fun .
the contractor &apos;s gonna do the weather stripping
on the storefront on monday .
and ?
and he said the reinforced foam
is much more efficient than the self @-@ stick plastic .
no ! i want a written statement .
sore loser .
yes !
weather stripping .
it &apos;s the latest controversy rocking the burke household .
imagine that . wow .
you guys are very quiet .
you want some more wine ?
yes .
please .
you and peter are really happy , huh ?
yeah .
wife of an fbi agent . that &apos;s not easy , is it ?
yeah , i would be lying if i said i didn &apos;t worry about him .
but i knew who he was when i fell in love with him .
you never tried to change that ?
no . why would i ?
i mean , we &apos;re married .
for better or for worse .
and now he &apos;s got neal .
for better or for worse .
yeah .
but for the record , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s actually better .
you trust neal ?
wow . that &apos;s a loaded question .
i &apos;m guessing you don &apos;t ?
well , you said it yourself . i know who he is .
neal is a lot of things ,
but ... when it counts , you can trust him .
think i &apos;m in trouble ?
no , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re discussing shoes .
shoes ?
what do you think they &apos;re talking about ?
us .
yeah . well , you .
you &apos;ve got a lot to learn about women .
oh , i &apos;ve got a lot to learn ?
i come home to this every night .
last sunday ...
i was on that couch , lying with el .
she &apos;s reading , and i &apos;m watching the game ,
and satchmo &apos;s asleep on my feet .
it hits me . again .
i &apos;m the luckiest guy .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s who i am .
you just need to figure it out .
and when you do ,
then you &apos;ll be the luckiest guy .
hey , nice ass .
i should go .
look , i know things are complicated .
well , that &apos;s kind of your specialty , neal .
i could teach a master class . yeah .
i want you to know i wasn &apos;t lying
when i said things were over between me and alex .
i meant it .
at the time .
at the time .
yeah .
you owe me a lunch .
we &apos;ve narrowed it down to these 15 warehouses .
we &apos;re going in one by one till we find that sub .
now remember , adler &apos;s men are armed , so eyes and ears .
let &apos;s get to work .
adler &apos;s not getting away , neal . i won &apos;t let him .
i know .
you always were persistent , neal .
one of the many qualities i admire about you .
fbi &apos;s closing in , adler .
i know .
there &apos;s an 18 @-@ wheeler just inside there ,
loaded with a collection of art more valuable than life .
you help me get past the fbi perimeter ,
half of it &apos;s yours .
sounds like a really good deal .
you must think i &apos;m an idiot .
i think you &apos;re an opportunist .
you took everything from me .
only after you tried to do the same to me .
all &apos;s fair in love and war .
tell me why kate had to die .
if you want my help now , tell me .
the explosives on the plane were her idea .
you parachute out over the ocean ,
the plane explodes ,
you live happily ever after .
but then she called , said burke had just arrived .
then , as now , he threatened to ruin everything .
so you blew up the plane early .
i could have waited another 30 seconds , and you &apos;d be dead , too .
am i supposed to be grateful ?
you were as close to a son as i ever had .
no .
i &apos;m nothing like you !
there &apos;s nothing sadder than a con man conning himself .
come on , neal .
let &apos;s stop hurting the people we love .
let &apos;s bring this thing full circle . you and me .
just like old times .
go to hell .
tell me you got the tnt out !
something must have sparked . old wiring .
the art is gonna burn !
come on !
it &apos;s clear . nothing .
boss ?
where the hell &apos;s neal ?
come on !
get down !
fire department &apos;s 15 minutes away !
no , no ! out of my way !
it &apos;s too late , vincent . it &apos;s too late .
it &apos;s gone .
you did this !
no .
i took from you , now you take from me .
no .
i would never burn that art . you know that .
you won &apos;t get away with this .
goodbye , neal .
he would have killed me .
what did he mean , &quot; you won &apos;t get away with this &quot; ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re all right .
you okay , neal ?
yeah .
come on . we &apos;ll get you back .
damn it , neal .
neal !
you did this --
the fire , all of it .
you did it .
peter , those were masterpieces .
i would never burn them . you know that .
no . but you &apos;d steal them .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
that long con on adler , it finally paid off , didn &apos;t it ?
you saw your chance , and then you took it .
i don &apos;t know how .
i don &apos;t know what game you are playing .
i have no idea , peter .
i &apos;m not lying to you now . i didn &apos;t steal the art .
i think you did .
then prove it .
prove it .
