what are you doing ? -i reorganized the fridge .
see ? bottom shelf , meats and dairy .
middle shelf , fruits and vegetables .
and top shelf , expired products .
why are you doing this ?
because i &apos;m bored out of my mind .
i &apos;ve already been to the bank , post office and dry cleaners .
dude , you just described seven days &apos; worth of stuff .
spread it out a little .
haven &apos;t you ever been unemployed ?
i &apos;m not unemployed . i &apos;m on sabbatical .
hey , don &apos;t get religious on me , okay ?
a guy in your position needs to be better at relaxing .
that &apos;s why we have comfortable chairs .
here , sit down .
ready ? watch .
and then ....
so , what ? we just sit ?
oh , no , no.we &apos;re not gonna just sit .
watch .

last year i spread a little joy , but not enough .
so this year i &apos;m doing the whole city .
i knew a girl in high school who did that .
she was very popular .
it &apos;s weird , you &apos;re starting to sound a lot like chandler lately .
that is so not true .
so , phoebe , where are you doing your bell @-@ ringing ?
they gave me a great spot right by macy &apos;s .
they never give a good spot to a rookie ...
... but i &apos;m the only one who can say &quot; merry christmas &quot; in 25 languages .
i lied !
oh , my god . here &apos;s danny.just watch this .

i &apos;m sorry , man .
what you should do ...
... is make something happen for yourself .
you know , like write a play.or a movie .
what about those good will hunting guys ?
be realistic , you know ?
if i did write something ... what are the chances i could get those guys to star in it ?
wait a second . i could star in it !
or that .
i can &apos;t write . i mean ,
i &apos;m an actor .
i could act like a writer . here ....
but see ? nada .
i don &apos;t have the discipline that it takes .
i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;ll help you .
yeah . i &apos;ll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it .
plus , it &apos;ll give me something to do .
you &apos;d do that for me ? thanks .
yes @-@ thanks

and it can &apos;t be joey.-it &apos;s not .
or joseph .
what &apos;s up ?
i just saw danny on the subway with a girl ...
... and he had his arm around her .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
you should be . this is all your fault .
you meddled in our relationship !
you had no relationship !
but i was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan !
oh , god , stop with the plan !
so what if you saw him with a girl ? that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
you &apos;ll go out with danny
and be so charming he &apos;ll forget all about that stupid subway girl .
she was kind of stupid .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m just going to go on the date .
i &apos;m just going to go on the date . that is the new plan .
hurry !
how do you spell &quot; suspicious &quot; ?
why ? i think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff .
yes
chandler bing , seven ! chandler bing , zero !
you &apos;re driving me crazy with that .
i &apos;ll stop .
don &apos;t stop.move the bowl further away . ross could make that shot .
well , you suck . but at least you suck at a man &apos;s game now .
want to play ?
i can &apos;t play games.ross &apos;ll be home soon .
i have to write five pages to stick to his schedule .
so play for 30 minutes , then write until he gets home .
all right .
but listen , what do you say we ... crank it up a notch ?
i &apos;m intrigued .
all right . all we need is a little lighter fluid .
but be careful . i want our security deposit back .
we said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts .
do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle ?
uh yeah right here

that &apos;s it ?
you &apos;re supposed to have five pages done by now ... including an exciting incident .
what is all this ?
&quot; the official rulebook of fireball . &quot;
that &apos;s the game we played .
it &apos;s great . you take a tennis ball , a bowl and lighter
this is helping your career ?
you wanted to be an actor.not the creator of &quot; crazy lawsuit game . &quot;
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll get back to work .

now come on .
you can have this back when the five pages are done .

it &apos;s very nice to meet you .

you wouldn &apos;t believe what people put in here !
does this look like a garbage can to you ?
does it look like an ashtray ?
does it look like a urinal ?
so you going back out there ?
yeah , but i won &apos;t take any more crap .
no more mrs. nice bucket .
good . you &apos;re tough . you lived on the street .
i &apos;ll go back to being street phoebe .
but not totally back . street phoebe wouldn &apos;t be friends with you guys .
can i ask you guys something ?
i don &apos;t have brothers , so i don &apos;t know ,
but did you guys wrestle ?
oh , yeah .
all the time .
in fact , i was undefeated .
well , you weighed 200 pounds .
still , i was quick as a cat .
i met danny &apos;s sister yesterday .
that was the girl on the subway .
you &apos;re kidding .
they were very , you know ... wrestle @-@ y .
but i guess that &apos;s normal ?
we don &apos;t wrestle now .
not since i got too strong for you .
too strong for me ?
you wanna go right now ?
i &apos;ll take you right now , buddy ! you wanna go ?
oh , fine .
ready ?
wrestle !
okay , you know what ? actually , that helps a lot . thanks .
let &apos;s go ! the puck drops in 20 minutes !
joey &apos;s not going .
i didn &apos;t finish my five pages .
finish them tomorrow .
tomorrow he &apos;s redoing yesterday &apos;s pages .
yesterday &apos;s pages did not reflect my best work .
cut him some slack . if he relaxes , he &apos;ll get some work done .
i think he &apos;s been relaxing enough , thanks to you ... and fireball .
if you think fireball &apos;s relaxing , you &apos;ve never played .
you &apos;re doing this because you &apos;re bored .
it &apos;s not his fault you &apos;re unemployed .
i am not unemployed . i &apos;m on sabbatical !
guys , don &apos;t fight .
and i &apos;m doing this because i am joey &apos;s friend .
if you were a friend , you &apos;d be doing the same .
so being a friend means being a jerk ?
if it does , then you &apos;re an amazing friend of mine .
let &apos;s settle this over a game of fireball .
i &apos;ll unhook the smoke detectors .
let &apos;s settle this right now .
there . now no one &apos;s going to the game .
i paid for those !
you said you would , but you didn &apos;t .
oh , yeah .
we finally get to the top of the mountain ...
... and airhead here forgets the camera .
the same thing happened to me one time .
when did that happen to you ?
remember ? we were jogging and saw that bird .
i wanted to take a picture , but i didn &apos;t have my camera .
chasing the churro guy is not jogging .
oh , this is so good . you have got to try it .
damn . i got it on my pants .
here , i &apos;ll get it .
we better take them off or the stain will set .
i want to wear them tonight .
oh , great .
okay , bye . oh , my god !
that was unbelievable .
see ? i told you .
yeah . sorry .
i don &apos;t believe they &apos;re brother and sister .
they &apos;re brother and sister ? !
i guess you &apos;ll have to cancel your date .
and call their mother .
wait a minute . open your hand . let me take a look .
quarter , dime . lint ? not interested in that .
what &apos;s this ? a canadian coin ? get out of here !
no drinks near the bucket .
set it down there and then you can make a contribution .
you can leave the &quot; hurt bunny &quot; look over there too .
hi , bob .
i thought i told you to get out of here !
phoebe , we &apos;ve been getting complaints.we &apos;re moving you to a less high @-@ profile spot .
what ?
ginger &apos;s taking this corner .
that chick can &apos;t handle my corner .
look , either you leave or we remove you .
fine .
i &apos;ll give you one pointer . look out for that bitch .
i thought we said 7 .
you know what ? let &apos;s skip it .
what ? why ?
you and your sister seem to have a very special bond
oh , great . that &quot; special bond &quot; again .
why do women have a problem with my being close to my sister ?
i don &apos;t know , but
do you have brothers ?
no , i have two sisters .
but one has a very masculine energy .
are you close ?
no . they &apos;re not very nice people .
i like you .
i think this could go somewhere .
so i &apos;m close to my family . don &apos;t let it stand in our way .
well , i don &apos;t know ....
when you put it that way ... danny ? hurry up . the bath &apos;s getting cold .
what ?
i &apos;ll see you later .
there &apos;s some kids playing in the street .
want to go give them a project , ruin their day ?
if they have a ball , you could stick razors in it ...
... and teach them a new game : &quot; gonna @-@ need @-@ stitches ball . &quot;
hey , guys ! i was at the library .
i already finished my five pages .
now we can go to the ranger game last night !
no , dude . ross tore up the tickets .
i guess without so many distractions it &apos;s easier for you to focus ?
also without somebody breathing down your neck all the livelong day !
the important thing is , i finished it .
and i think it &apos;s really good .
but it would help if i could hear it .
would you guys read it for me ?
yeah , all right .
all right .
&quot; it &apos;s a typical new york apartment .
two guys are hanging out . &quot;
&quot; hey , man . &quot;
&quot; what is up ? &quot;
&quot; about yesterday . i was really wrong . i am sorry . &quot;
&quot; no , it was me . i &apos;m sorry . i overreacted . &quot;
&quot; maybe it was both of us . but we had our best friend &apos;s inter

and you.you co @-@ created fireball . &quot;
