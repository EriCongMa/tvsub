x.o.x.o. , gossip girl .
the first day of a new queen &apos;s reign ...
nervous subjects twitter and tweet-- will she continue
where the old queen left off or strike out on her own ?
and what of queen b. ?
we hear n.y.u. is not yet under her golden thumb .
is she biding her time or simply doing time ?
but the real story this morning is a queen
of the silver screen just enrolled at n.y.u.
rumor has it she wants to keep a low profile .
sorry , your majesty . not if i can help it .
how have you never heard of olivia burke ?
come on . i thought you lived in brooklyn , not a cave .
no , i @-@ i think i have heard of her .
she &apos;s , the star of those zombie pirate movies ?
vam @-@ vampire knights .
oh , that makes more sense .
no , that &quot; endless knights &quot; series has made ,
like , a billion dollars .
it &apos;s king arthur with vampires .
are you serious right now ?
no , she plays guinevere ,
but , like , a hot , blood @-@ sucking guinevere .
well , being that i have no idea what she looks like ,
i &apos;ll make sure to keep an eye out for her .
hey , uh , one coffee , please. sure .
hey , man . i gotta run . i got a 10 : 00 class .
um , don &apos;t forget to read my hawthorne paper .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
i &apos;ll see you , man. cool .
that &apos;s a buck 50 .
oh , you know what ? i think i forgot my wallet .
hold on . i think i got change in here. hold on a second .
you know what ? um , there you go .
no , no , no , no. you don &apos;t have to do that. please .
karma. it &apos;ll come back to me .
okay . all right . thank you . that &apos;s incredibly nice .
you &apos;re welcome .
i &apos;m dan .
i &apos;m , uh , kate .
it &apos;s very nice to meet you , kate .
he &apos;s an overexaggerated smilodon with comical green hair .
yeah. nonsense .
clearly battle cat is a relative of the royal indian tiger .
they look exactly alike. have you even
no .
excuse me . i &apos;m looking for the masters of the universe society .
and you have found us .
no , i think you misheard .
i said the &quot; masters of the universe . &quot;
it &apos;s a term used for wall streeters .
not that i give two hoots about finance .
i just need to know that in this misbegotten corner of manhattan ,
that wealth , ambition and moral laxity are alive and well .
young lady ,
i said we are the masters of the universe--
a society dedicated to promulgating the
philosophical and political messages
contained in the 1981 to &apos; 83 cartoon featuring he @-@ man .
we also do role @-@ playing .
oh , my god .
what are you doing ?
you don &apos;t tell a girl you do role @-@ playing .
i love role @-@ playing , all right ?
good morning , beautiful .
n.y.u. is hell .
what do you expect from a place
where the men wear sandals ?
just be thankful georgina &apos;s visiting her parents in
connecticut for the week .
how can i rule over people i don &apos;t understand ?
it &apos;s hopeless .
you know , today is the first day of constance .
do you remember ?
how you used to mortar and pestle
all those hopeful young spirits ?
look , the day will come .
it just takes time .
at least i know constance hasn &apos;t changed .
eric , constance is gonna be so different .
there &apos;s no more hierarchy , no more mean girls ,
no one copying how the queen dresses .
it &apos;s gonna be a new era of sunlight and fairness .
yeah , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what blair had in mind
when she picked you to be her successor .
too bad .
when does , jonathan get back from his fencing camp in torino ?
not till next month .
jenny .
oh , that &apos;s disturbing .
who are you ?
i &apos;m carmen. this is celeste . that &apos;s jane .
we &apos;re here to make sure
you get exactly what you want this year .
you &apos;re gonna rule the school with an iron fist .
okay , enough .
first , go wash your eyes , and second ,
tell everyone i need to talk to them now .
now .
so ... a new era of sunlight and fairness ?
shut up . that is absolutely unacceptable .
okay. uh , no , i &apos;m sorry .
my mom would never hit the table like that .
she , she would put her fingers to her forehead
and do that , like ,
&quot; why are you doing this to me ? &quot; thing .
oh , right . i know it. this ...
yeah , perfect .
so again .
okay , um ...
mom , i have decided not to go to brown .
oh , serena .
i ...
please know that i &apos;ve put a lot of thought into this .
what is it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
she , she would just only do the forehead thing for a second ,
then she would look to the side and
do these little head shakes , you know ?
uh , serena , i appreciate your pointers ,
but the purpose of this role @-@ playing is to
get you ready to tell your mom about brown .
no , i know . i know .
i , i &apos;m just , i &apos;m really nervous about her coming back tomorrow ,
and , and when are you gonna tell her about
the whole scott drama ?
uh , after she digests the fact that
her daughter &apos;s not going to college .
that &apos;s a lot to hit her with right away . now one more time .
mom .
yes , dear .
you &apos;re here .
serena .
lily .
oh , oh , rufus !
oh , my gosh .
it is so good to see you both .
you didn &apos;t tell us you were coming .
well , cece &apos;s feeling so much better ,
so i thought i would surprise you .
serena , what are you doing here ?
shouldn &apos;t you be at brown ?
so i &apos;ve been reading the course catalog ,
and everything just sounds so interesting ,
like cold war philosophy and the bible as literature ,
the post @-@ impressionist movement .
i want to take everything .
and you say you &apos;re from jersey ?
seriously , i had to convince a lot of people to let me come here .
i &apos;m determined to take advantage of it .
well , you know what , on behalf of everyone at n.y.u. ,
all of &apos; em , welcome .
my stuff just got here . i gotta go move in .
okay , well , how am i gonna pay you back for this ?
call it my treat .
it was really nice to meet you , dan .
it was nice meeting you , kate .
i know how much you want me to go , but this is the right thing .
i was against it at first ,
but i think there are benefits to serena deferring a year .
and i &apos;m gonna do something productive while i &apos;m here ,
get a job or , or an internship .
mom , say something .
well , serena , if this is just a case of cold feet , fine .
i mean , classes have barely begun .
it &apos;s not about cold feet .
i &apos;m just not ready . i don &apos;t know who i am .
but that &apos;s why people go to college , to figure it out .
wasn &apos;t that the point of this summer ?
you were going to europe to find yourself ?
well , i didn &apos;t find ...
what i was looking for .
well , unless your real self is waiting for you at antik ,
i don &apos;t see the point in another year
of gallivanting around new york .
i told you , i &apos;m going to work .
i love you , serena ,
but you have never worked a day in your life .
look , why don &apos;t you give college a try ?
if it takes me getting a job for you to believe that i &apos;m serious ,
then i &apos;ll do it .
but for now , i am not going to college .
i &apos;m sorry , lily . i debated calling you .
it &apos;s okay , honey . i understand .
you knew i was with my mother , and you didn &apos;t want to burden me .
but make no mistake . i am back , and she is going to brown .
all right , i &apos;m gonna unpack .
there is no more hierarchy .
the steps of the met will no longer
be restricted to a certain crowd .
no more nair @-@ tinis. no more headbands .
this is a new era .
let freedom ring .
well , well. word is that
change is in the air , at constance billard .
... the madness and genius of skeletor .
that is correct . i said &quot; genius . &quot;
i have to wonder ... when queen b finds out how little j
is treating her legacy ...
will she let it slide ?
oh , thank god .
by the way , sandals are not shoes .
uh , no , she &apos;s not here yet , but the room looks great .
she should be here any second .
um , hello ? excuse me ?
oh , i gotta go . i will call you back , bye .
you must be vanessa abrams .
yeah .
i got a message from the housing office today
saying that my new roommate was coming in .
are you ...
no , i just work for her .
i hope you don &apos;t mind . we gave the room a little lift .
i see that you took down my godard poster .
this is for you . i &apos;ve given one to all the girls in the hall .
hold on. what is all this stuff ,
and , and who is my roommate ?
and still no word from our reclusive starlet ,
but i have a feeling ...
uh , that &apos;d be me .
oh , my god .
we &apos;re in for a blockbuster .
com now i &apos;m so sorry .
i had no idea that my publicist was doing all this stuff .
and for the record , i love godard .
i &apos;m just trying to wrap my head around the fact that
my roomate is olivia burke .
and mine &apos;s ... vanessa abrams .
just two girls going to n.y.u. ,
it &apos;s crazy , right ?
yeah .
is that a confidentiality waiver ?
k.c. gave this to you ?
yeah , and the rest of the hall .
i cannot believe her .
excuse me .
thank you so much for seeing me on short notice .
you came highly recommended by anna wintour .
i was happy to make the time . tell me about yourself .
um , i @-@ i grew up on the upper east side .
i , um , i &apos;ve always been interested in fashion and art .
i graduated from constance billard this past june .
i was supposed to start brown a few weeks ago ,
but then i realized i wasn &apos;t ready .
so you come here ?
fashion isn &apos;t fallback college , you know .
no , i know . yeah , i @-@ i understand that .
we &apos;re thrilled you &apos;re serious about this .
yeah , you know , i want more life experience ,
and with the work you &apos;re doing with a.p.f ...
i find so interesting .
i will work for nothing . it can be like an internship .
so do you think that you have anything ?
no , nothing .
they all want me to come to their parties ,
but none of them want me to actually work for them .
no , i &apos;m taking myself to lunch at hundred acres .
why do you sound so happy ?
what do you mean , you had to quell a revolution ?
blair , i gotta go . i &apos;ll call you later .
why are you not listening to me ?
i am not asking the girls in my hall
to sign confidentiality waivers .
they already hate me enough .
they don &apos;t hate you ,
at least not after
i sent them all invites to your premiere tomorrow .
you really don &apos;t get it .
i told you that
i wanted to have a normal college experience .
but , honey , this is your moment , okay ?
i mean , this movie is--is good @-@ bye teenage vampires
and hello , oscar .
all right , i &apos;m backing off .
you know , you have &quot; larry king &quot; tonight .
oh , great . did you call them ?
olivia , calm down .
don &apos;t tell me to calm down .
why do you always do this ?
ex @-@ excuse me ?
what ?
i &apos;m sorry . that was really rude .
uh , yes , hi .
don &apos;t worry about it .
um , just go through the kitchen ,
make a left at the freezer and then a right .
it &apos;ll put you out on sullivan .
they were following me around for a while ,
so i learned the back exits everywhere .
wow . thanks . you &apos;re serena , right ?
um , i loved your dress at the met ball .
oh . thank you .
don &apos;t forget-- &quot; larry king . &quot;
that was amazing .
you &apos;re like the diva whisperer .
i &apos;m kenny cunningham , k.c. i &apos;m olivia &apos;s publicist .
serena van der woodsen .
i know . so , um , are you going to college in the city ?
uh , no , i @-@ i deferred for a year .
i &apos;m actually looking for a job .
really ?
have you ever thought about publicity ?
this is not a democracy , ladies .
everyone does not get a voice , and that &apos;s okay .
what is this ?
did you not hear me this morning ?
oh , you mean your cute little attempt at perestroika ?
we &apos;re going back to the old way--
queens , hierarchy and no brooklyn wannabes .
sorry , little j.
who told you to call me that ?
okay , unless i &apos;m blind ,
their headbands were monogrammed with &quot; b.w. &quot;
what a surprise .
i can &apos;t believe you didn &apos;t get that girl &apos;s number .
how long is bree in texas ?
&apos;cause , uh ,
maybe she should help you out with your english paper .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you just expect more game
from the guy who dated serena van der woodsen .
hey . there--there she is .
what ?
that &apos;s--that &apos;s--that &apos;s kate ,
the girl we &apos;ve been talking about .
she &apos;s right there .
that girl ?
yeah . dude , that ...
is a sign that you should go ask her out .
okay .
all right .
you know what ? i will .
hey , kate .
uh , k-- kate ?
hey . sorry .
i , uh , i said your name twice . um , it &apos;s dan .
sorry . uh , i have a lot on my mind .
right . right . how &apos;s your first day going ?
it &apos;s been a harder adjustment than i expected .
yeah , well , listen , i still want to pay you back ...
for this morning , so , um ,
i thought maybe we could grab some pizza sometime
or--or , you know , like , tomorrow or ...
what about right now ?
right--right now ?
i mean , yeah , sure .
right now is perfect . right now is great .
in fact , i , uh , i know a place around the corner .
okay .
oh , my god .
unbelievable .
we have a movie premiere tomorrow .
i &apos;m gonna ask you to work with olivia &apos;s costar .
your background experience with the press-- i think
you are just what she needs .
i appreciate your confidence .
thank me later .
you are clueless ! this is too blue !
this is too pink ! this is too red !
k.c.
this is the most important night of my life ,
and you have me surrounded by amateurs ?
and color @-@ blind amateurs with hidden agendas ?
you know that nobody supports me .
everybody wants to see me fail .
ursula , i want you to meet serena van der woodsen .
poor s. no one told her this was going to be a horror movie .
you must have thought i was crazy .
no , i didn &apos;t think you were crazy .
oh , please . you know you were like ,
&quot; let me get this crazy lady to a party . &quot;
and thank god you did , because i &apos;ve been cooped up here all day long .
okay , maybe a little crazy .
okay , serena , i &apos;m sorry that i had you stay here and sleep on this couch .
it &apos;s just--the stress of this movie is making me feel like i &apos;m losing my mind .
well , it sounds fantastic .
and i never knew josephine baker was a part of the french resistance .
it &apos;s an amazing part .
okay , there &apos;s this one scene where we &apos;re trapped by the nazis ,
and i have to distract them while the others escape .
and i think ...
it &apos;s probably the best work i &apos;ve ever done .
chuck , what are you doing here ?
i would ask you the same question .
i stopped by your dorm last night . no one was home .
oh , i didn &apos;t tell you ?
i &apos;ve been tutoring a few girls from constance .
we went late .
well , i found this-- an invitation to a movie premiere .
it appears your entire hall is attending , and since my evening is free ...
you thought you &apos;d help me curry favor with my outer borough hall mates .
sweet .
but unfortunately ,
i &apos;ve already scheduled an all @-@ night cram session with my tutees , so ...
miss blair ?
you want me set beds before manicurists arrive or--
thank you , dorota .
that will be all .
you &apos;re sure you said &quot; cram session &quot;
and not the annual waldorf sleepover ?
fine .
i &apos;m hosting the sleepover .
but jenny humphrey is destroying everything i worked for ,
and those girls deserve to learn the meaning of aristocracy .
we both know it &apos;s not about that .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
now i have work to do , but feel free to attend the movie alone .
i have dr . hannum. he &apos;s english lit .
he studied with faulkner .
this is so nice of you , to help me .
sharing wisdom is what college is all about , right ?
right .
that , and , uh , and finding the cheapest lebanese food .
which , um , i @-@ i @-@ i thought i &apos;d show you tonight , if ...
y @-@ you know--you know what ? i &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s two nights in a row .
it &apos;s a huge dating taboo .
no. no , it &apos;s that i have to work .
i was supposed to last night , and i blew it off , so ...
dan , i like you .
but i think my life is more complicated than you know .
try me . i think i can handle it .
look , i @-@ i @-@ i really like you , too .
you &apos;re funny and smart , and ... you know what ?
i &apos;m just gonna throw it out there--you &apos;re beautiful .
i mean ,
an alarming number of people actually
stop on the street just to stare at you .
and on top of that , you &apos;re refreshingly normal .
what do you mean by &quot; refreshingly normal &quot; ?
um , well , the last girl i dated ,
her--her life was never really out of the spotlight ,
so it made things kind of hard .
where are you ? ! u need get ready for the premiere !
i gotta go .
so can i-- can i call you tomorrow ?
or ...
dan , i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m the girl you &apos;re looking for ,
even if part of me wishes i was .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t understand .
you will . i &apos;m sorry .
congratulations .
your girlfriend &apos;s installed a puppet regime .
blair &apos;s gone colonel kurtz .
she needs to be brought back to reality .
help me .
i &apos;ll help you take back the crown .
why ? they don &apos;t want my kind of leadership .
they want a tyrant who will police their
behavior and chart their movement on the social ladder .
find someone else .
i need you .
you &apos;re fooling yourself if you don &apos;t
think you were born to rule this school .
people change , chuck .
not you , not about this .
the jenny humphrey who used to sit in brooklyn
and watch the lights across the water , who went
toe @-@ to @-@ toe with blair waldorf and actually won her
respect-- you can &apos;t tell me that girl isn &apos;t still in there .
now that the dream is coming true ,
you owe it to her to live it .
blair doesn &apos;t want me to be queen .
well , maybe we can make her reconsider .
where is it ? you &apos;ve lost it !
hold on . where have you been ?
i had to get my dress . what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know . get in there .
my mother &apos;s ring--i lost it .
i cannot go to the premiere without my mother &apos;s ring .
it &apos;s my good luck charm .
ursula , you--you put it in your bag yesterday . here .
oh , thank you .
of course .
honey , time &apos;s a @-@ wasting . you need to get ready .
i &apos;m so nervous .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
hey , is everything okay ?
i just heard from the producers .
that scene ursula &apos;s so proud of ?
it got cut .
what ?
we have to tell her .
serena , no .
i know this is difficult , but if we tell her ,
she &apos;ll ditch the premiere ,
which will hurt her career enormously .
trust me . no , this is for her own good .
thanks . i gotta take this .
serena , can you help me ?
can you help me with my hair ? serena ?
convinced lily to come to the premier . see you there .
serena ? i need help with my hair .
so i think i just got dumped .
you maybe want to go see a movie or something like that ?
yeah . a movie sounds great .
but you &apos;re gonna have to wear a suit .
vanessa : i &apos;m here . where are u ?
blair , o.m.g.b.s.e.
oh , my god . best sleepover ever .
yes , i suppose it is adequate .
dorota , these martinis taste like tap water .
don &apos;t be a scrooge with the gin .
miss blair , this not right .
mr. chuck and i both of the opinion
and who cares what you and mr. chuck think ?
szybko .
now who wants to hear how i got the great chuck bass ...
to tell me he loved me ?
exquisite .
you exceed even my high expectations .
i &apos;m only here for the good of the school , chuck .
and i &apos;m only here for blair .
and now for one of the most time @-@ honored
traditions of the sleepover--truth or dare .
hey . i &apos;m not talking to hear myself speak .
sorry , blair .
it &apos;s ... just ...
gossip girl says jenny humphrey &apos;s at the
premiere of olivia burke &apos;s new movie ... and she &apos;s with ...
who ?
spotted on the red carpet
jenny humphrey on the arm of the red baron ,
chuck bass .
guess queen b isn &apos;t starring in this melodrama .
oh , my god .
rufus , why are you dragging me to this ?
you really couldn &apos;t wait till it comes out in the theaters ?
are you kidding ?
nazis and cabaret singers--
it &apos;s like &quot; casablanca &quot; meets &quot; showgirls . &quot;
this is my dream movie .
how did you get tickets to the premiere ?
i have a connection .
mom . rufus , thank you .
no problem . um , this is some event .
what is going on ? did you two arrange this ?
hmm . i @-@ i &apos;m gonna go and , uh , get another bag of popcorn , just in case .
so i got a job with a publicist ,
and i thought if you saw me working ,
you would feel better about brown .
right . yes .
because , um ,
a year of parties and premieres is a
worthy alternative to an ivy league education .
mom ...
please don &apos;t make me regret inviting you here .
i &apos;ve got a lot to worry about already .
fine , fine , no brown talk .
now tell me .
well , um , i &apos;ve become friends with ursula nyquist ,
and she &apos;s really counting on this movie and her big scene ,
which has been cut .
k.c. , my boss , doesn &apos;t want me to tell her .
well , you have to , i mean ,
if she really is a friend . right ?
but k.c. believes that it &apos;s for her own good ,
and--and k.c. &apos; s my boss .
this woman saw an opportunity to
exploit your celebrity and your connections .
why else would she hire an
18 @-@ year @-@ old with no skills and no college degree ?
maybe because she believes in me .
serena , i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
oh , ursula , this is my mom lily .
lily , this is ursula .
nice to meet you .
hi . nice to meet you , too .
can i talk to your daughter for a second ?
is everything okay ?
i feel like people are whispering .
no , every @-@ everything &apos;s fine .
look , w @-@ we should get you inside .
mom , i got work to do .
oh , my god . dan .
what are you doing here ?
me ? i could ask you the same thing .
you &apos;re supposed to be working , right ?
you &apos;re not serious .
see , it &apos;s fine if you didn &apos;t want to go out with me .
it &apos;s really--really--i mean ,
you didn &apos;t have to lie about it .
no , i @-@ i didn &apos;t .
uh , you know what ? i gotta find vanessa . i &apos;m sorry .
vanessa ? w @-@ wait .
like vanessa abrams ?
yeah . she &apos;s--she &apos;s my friend , how do you know her ?
dan , i @-@ i have to tell you something .
o @-@ olivia. olivia ,
hey , can we get
whoa , whoa , whoa. what &apos;s that ?
what &apos;s--what &apos;s going on right there ?
why are they
y ...
oh , my--oh , my god .
are you--you &apos;re not ...
fleur .
you are .
yeah .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey .
hey .
you met olivia ?
yeah. yeah , apparently .
these are the plans from de gaulle .
i smuggled them in with my sheet music .
germans .
they cannot be allowed to have these documents .
i &apos;ll distract them while you slip out the back .
but how ?
how else ? i &apos;ll sing .
i never heard her song ,
but i owe josephine my life ,
as does france .
next day , i was in london .
hold on. wait , wait .
she &apos;s in the stall .
we &apos;ll give her another minute ,
then we &apos;ll let her go in front of cameras .
no , but i @-@ i thought that was bad for her .
that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t tell her in the first place .
serena ,
an actress who finds out that her scene is cut
and skips the premiere is a lame story .
an actress who finds it out during the premiere ,
then has a meltdown
now that is great public theater .
so you lied to me .
only because you couldn &apos;t deal with the truth .
i needed ursula to trust you ,
like i do now .
ursula , honey , it &apos;s time to come out .
serena &apos;s here .
did you really think that your lame attempt ...
blair. blair , stop it .
to embarrass me would you get back queen ?
blair .
i will make your life a living hell .
blair , calm-- it wasn &apos;t her idea .
this was you ?
do you have any idea how much you humiliated me ?
i think you accomplished that
with your little teenybopper sleepover .
look , n.y.u. &apos; s hard ,
but blair waldorf does not give up .
i &apos;m not giving up . i &apos;ve made a strategic retreat .
po @-@ tay @-@ to , po @-@ tah @-@ to .
you don &apos;t understand .
i do understand. let me help .
no , chuck. n.y.u. is not the upper east side .
they don &apos;t care about constance
or the social hierarchy .
they don &apos;t care that i &apos;m blair waldorf .
it &apos;s over .
and you &apos;d do this to me ?
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m chuck bass , and i told you i love you .
you &apos;re saying i &apos;m easier to win over than
a bunch of pseudo @-@ intellectual , homesick malcontents ?
you &apos;d really insult me like this .
that &apos;s not how it is .
it &apos;s exactly how it is .
so the next time you forget you &apos;re blair waldorf ,
remember , i &apos;m chuck bass ,
and i love you .
hey .
great movie .
you were , uh , you were amazing .
and i &apos;m an idiot .
no , i sh--
i should have told you who i was .
why didn &apos;t you ?
i have been dreaming of coming to n.y.u.
and just being a normal student .
and my very first day ,
this cute guy doesn &apos;t recognize me .
i couldn &apos;t help myself .
and my middle name &apos;s kate .
you said it yourself ,
that i was refreshingly normal .
i did , yeah , i ...
you have to understand , though ,
that my last couple of relationships have
been just-- they--they &apos;ve been full of drama .
all right , dan , i get it .
i do .
and as much as i want to be kate , i &apos;m also olivia ,
and you don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll see you around .
um , excuse me ?
uh , can i take you picture ?
what ? why ?
aren &apos;t you blair waldorf ?
yes .
yes , i guess i am .
i can &apos;t believe they cut my scene .
so go out there and--
and throw the biggest fit of your life .
i mean , those producers screwed you .
go steal their show .
serena , is that what you think i should do ?
i @-@ i think ...
if you want people to see you as--
as a real actress ,
you should be gracious and ...
and that the movie &apos;s more important than your scene .
ursula , she &apos;s a teenager. she knows nothing .
kenny , shut up .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry. i @-@ i couldn &apos;t do it to her .
i understand ...
like i &apos;m sure you understand that you &apos;re fired .
i got fired .
k.c. wanted ursula to have a meltdown in front of the press ,
and i told her not to , so k.c. fired me .
i guess you were right .
well , it &apos;s for the best. you &apos;ll love brown .
mom , i &apos;m not going to brown .
maybe next year , but not now .
what are you talking about ? you &apos;re all packed .
if this year is about finding out who i am ,
then i can &apos;t do that and live here .
serena , enough is enough .
this need to find out who you are-- do
you think anyone really knows who they are ?
we don &apos;t. we just live .
so that &apos;s it ? that &apos;s your advice--to give up ?
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not gonna do this your way .
lil , she &apos;s gonna be okay .
this is your fault .
that &apos;s not fair .
not fair ?
i go away to take care of my mother ,
and i come back and my daughter is not going to college .
i trusted you. then trust me now. don &apos;t force her .
i think i just need to be alone .
hey . i loved the movie last night , though it was no &quot; endless nights . &quot;
don &apos;t say anything . i &apos;m a closet fan .
so i &apos;m gonna pretend that you &apos;re not a movie star ,
and we &apos;re just two roommates .
coming here , i just-- i wanted to be normal , everyday me .
and amazingly enough , i met someone who liked that person .
but i can &apos;t pretend that the other one doesn &apos;t exist .
i dated a guy who kept part of himself hidden .
he never gave anyone a chance to accept him .
and ... in the end , everyone lost .
dan &apos;s ...
a really special guy .
i &apos;m gonna go .
we &apos;re like real roommates .
that &apos;s kind of totally awesome .
of course , s .
mi casa , su casa .
i sound chipper ? well , i &apos;m on my way to a meeting .
just a little club i &apos;m starting .
oh , you all made it. excellent .
now here &apos;s the situation .
each of us attended elite schools ,
failed to go ivy and now find ourselves
wasting away in a patchouli @-@ scented purgatory .
do we deserve it ? no .
do we need to put up with it ?
definitely not .
what do you suggest ?
candide said , &quot; on doit cultiver son jardin . &quot;
well , n.y.u.
is my garden ,
and i plan to rake and hoe and weed it till it looks exactly the way i want .
but i can &apos;t do it alone. now who &apos;s with me ?
you can count on us .
if you ask me , we go to the movies
because we want to see fairy tales ...
oh , uh , by the way , that came for you .
a sleeping queen woken by her true love &apos;s kiss ...
that concludes our business .
so , uh , why &apos;d you want me to take that girl &apos;s picture ?
dumbo could always fly .
he just needed a magic feather .
a princess who puts aside her jewels to make her way in the world ...
thank you so much for coming .
i wanted to see you before i went back to l.a.
of course. me , too .
and i wanted to tell you that i called k.c.
and i told her that if you do not work for her firm , i &apos;m not a client .
wow. that-- that was so nice of you .
please .
serena , you helped me find myself .
and i hope you are just as lucky .
okay ?
come here .
lovers torn apart being brought back together ...
hey . i was just thinking about you .
i thought i &apos;d call and see how you were .
i &apos;m good. how are you ?
good .
so , scott , i ... really was ...
hold on a second .
uh , vanessa , i &apos;m so sorry . i gotta take this .
uh , can i call you later ?
yeah .
sure. that--that &apos;s fine .
georgina , hey. what &apos;s up ?
no , i &apos;ll be there in a second .
i &apos;m a block from the restaurant .
but life isn &apos;t a fairy tale ...
and happy endings are few and far between ...
hey , jenny. is there anything we can do for you ?
in life , the young queen becomes a tyrant ...
actually ,
go make sure my spot &apos;s free at the met
steps and wait there with a yogurt for me .
and takes her subjects to war ...
so that &apos;s why we need movies ...
to remind us that despite it all ,
love can still spring in the most unlikely of places ...
i was just thinking ,
i didn &apos;t really give you a chance to know both sides of me ,
and i guess i &apos;m wondering if you still want to .
i don &apos;t even know why i &apos;m pretending to think about it .
yes. yes , of course .
and that sometimes even fairy tales can come true .
