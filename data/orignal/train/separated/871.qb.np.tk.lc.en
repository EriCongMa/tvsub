there &apos;s only one reason a teenage girl
leaps out of bed this happy on a school day --
first love .
for my sister ,
it was our neighbor across the street --
drew kremp .
and , man , oh , man ,
things got real serious real fast .
listen , i know we &apos;ve only been dating for a few weeks ,
but there &apos;s something i &apos;ve got to ask you .
erica elizabeth goldberg , will you --
my middle name &apos;s dorothy , but that -- that &apos;s okay .
uh , whatever you &apos;re gonna say , just say it .
will you wear my varsity jacket ?
yes ! yes , i will !
the varsity jacket -- the high @-@ school equivalent
of a marriage proposal .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s like a slipper -- like a glass slipper , but it &apos;s not !
it &apos;s a jacket !
my moody , angry sister
had somehow been replaced by a giddy , love @-@ struck teenager .
mom , so good .
i don &apos;t say this enough , but i love tacos .
and i love my family .
we called it the time of great peace .
for some , it was confusing .
i think she &apos;s on drugs .
a @-@ are you hopped up on goofballs ?
you &apos;re the cutest !
we &apos;ve all been there .
it &apos;s the happiest time in a young person &apos;s life .
your head &apos;s in the clouds , and nothing will bring you down ...
oh . sorry ! have a great day .
except when your first love dumps your ass for no reason at all .
boopie , what &apos;s wrong ? what is it ?
come , sit . tell mama .
what are you saying ?
are you physically hurt ?
did someone drop something on you ?
and then -- and then -- and then ...
i can &apos;t understand you .
she said drew kremp drove her home today
in his sweet mustang and dumped her out of nowhere .
how the hell did you understand her ?
as most of you know ,
i &apos;ve , uh , spent a majority of my life hysterical
and emotionally out of control .
i speak the language .
she &apos;d like some hot tea with a little bit of honey .
and with that , the time of great peace
descended into the age of darkness .
my strong , independent sister
turned into an irrational hot mess .
she moped in her room .
she sobbed in her car .
and she wept through dinner .
sweetie , you have to eat .
food reminds me of drew .
he used to eat food .
baby , if you don &apos;t eat ,
then i have failed as a mother .
then you have failed . we all have failed .
just take them ! just take the tots !
peanut , believe me , it &apos;s his loss .
i am dead inside ,
and that &apos;s what you say to me ?
she said she &apos;s dead inside --
i know what she said !
it was april 29 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and barry and i were strolling
into the one place that gave us pure joy like no other .
that &apos;s right -- the arcade .
we &apos;re home .
here you go , boys .
have fun with your beep @-@ bop @-@ boop .
back then , you couldn &apos;t just download a game to your phone .
you needed a roll of quarters and nerves of steel .
first we &apos;d play the classics like &quot; pac @-@ man &quot; and &quot; centipede . &quot;
then we &apos;d blow most of our quarters on &quot; dragon &apos;s lair . &quot;
how &apos;d they get a cartoon into a video game ?
you &apos;re so dumb . they pour it in the top .
but our jam was &quot; zaxxon . &quot;
it was the greatest game ever made ...
until they made a better one .
it was called &quot; punch @-@ out ! ! &quot;
it combined everything my brother loved --
video games , sports ,
and graphic , senseless violence .
we &apos;re gonna get to know each other real good .
while we were lost in our world of video games ,
my mom was gonna help erica get clarity on the break @-@ up .
she went across the street to virginia kremp ,
her best friend and drew &apos;s mother .
hi !
hi .
hi .
hi .
hi .
hi .
how &apos;s erica holding up ?
ugh , she &apos;s a mess .
how &apos;s drew ?
he &apos;s great .
hmm ?
i mean , you know , he &apos;s good . he &apos;s -- he &apos;s fine .
he just went to the water park , which is ...
where he goes when he &apos;s sad .
that way no one can see his tears .
you know , it would really help erica
if you could just tell me what happened .
ooh , i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s our business , bev .
isn &apos;t it , though ?
i just think that drew needs some time alone
to figure himself out .
well , do you think he &apos;ll have himself figured out
in the next two days or so ?
probably not .
oh , just one more quick question --
uh , what is the name of drew &apos;s new bimbo ?
beverly , there &apos;s no one .
so you &apos;re saying that drew &apos;s made a terrible mistake ,
and it &apos;s just gonna be a matter of time
before he comes crawling back ?
well , you better tell drew
not to take too long to figure things out
&apos;cause , uh , erica &apos;s got a lot of guys coming around .
lot of guys .
and one girl .
she &apos;s not gonna do anything about that ,
but , uh ... still flattering .
think about it .
barry had spent the past week trying to beat &quot; punch @-@ out ! ! &quot;
just one problem --
he was out of quarters and had grown desperate .
a penny ?
worthless ! it &apos;s the garbage of money !
pops @-@ aroni , looking good .
did you lose some weight or just get a haircut ?
oh , what can i say ?
i &apos;ve been hit by the handsome stick .
well , you look like a million bucks .
speaking of a million bucks , can you float me a $ 20 ?
is this for the arcade again ?
this is the fourth time this week .
i got to cut you off , kiddo .
you can &apos;t cut me off . you &apos;re my grandfather !
you &apos;re supposed to give me
unconditional love and money until you pass !
i got three chicks on the string right now .
i got to manage my cash flow .
be selfish . i &apos;ll find money somewhere else .
hey , ad @-@ rock !
what do you say we go down to the arcade ?
it &apos;ll only cost you $ 20 .
sorry , i got a spelling test tomorrow .
why are you being such a ...
easy ! easy ! easy !
sorry .
lost my cool .
i &apos;m fine .
okay . i got money .
i &apos;ll just cash in the $ 100 bond you gave me last year .
that doesn &apos;t mature for another 10 years .
it &apos;s hardly worth anything right now .
you &apos;re a filthy liar , old man !
nope .
i did it again . lost my cool .
i &apos;m just ... constantly thinking about that game .
you know what i &apos;m saying ?
it &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s cool . it &apos;s cool .
what are you guys watching ?
i &apos;m gonna go take a walk . i &apos;m gonna go take a walk .
hey , dale .
guess who cashed in his $ 100 bond
and is now sitting on 6 bucks of cold , hard change .
i don &apos;t care .
that &apos;s the stuff .
figuring himself out ? what does that even mean ?
it means it &apos;s not you . it &apos;s him .
please .
that &apos;s what people always say , and it &apos;s total bullcrap .
please believe me .
you &apos;re tearing me apart . i can &apos;t see you this sad .
just tell me you &apos;re better .
i &apos;m not better .
my mood ring &apos;s been black for three days !
then fake it ... for me .
i wore my nightgown to school today .
i &apos;m in agony . i can &apos;t take it anymore .
way to make it about you , mom .
no , no , no . this is not about me .
it &apos;s about you feeling better so i can feel better .
make me feel better .
better ?
all i know is that i can &apos;t feel any worse .
are you kidding me ? !
shame on you , virginia kremp !
you told me there was nobody else !
right to my face , you told me !
oh , my god ! tracy sullivan ? !
are you freaking kidding me ? !
when i asked you if you thought she was pretty , you said , &quot; nah . &quot;
you said , &quot; nah &quot; !
he was just trying to spare her .
i didn &apos;t want you to find out this way .
so that &apos;s what you meant when you said he needed to figure himself out ? !
i live across the street from you ! you didn &apos;t think i &apos;d figure it out ? !
i was just trying to spare your feelings !
he was just trying to spare her feelings !
well , here &apos;s your stupid varsity jacket back !
use it to cover up tracy &apos;s stupid face !
yeah !
sorry , tracy , i know this isn &apos;t about you .
yeah !
i can &apos;t believe that this is happening .
nope . put those tissues down , missy .
i &apos;m gonna fix this . you know how ?
mama &apos;s gonna find you someone better .
that &apos;s right .
there are plenty of other fish in the sea .
i &apos;ll go .
erica had gone through
six pans of brownies since the break @-@ up .
fortunately , my dad stepped in to help with words of wisdom .
hey , peanut .
uh , i &apos;m gonna shut this off .
look , every time i try and cheer you up ,
i end up saying the wrong thing .
so this time i &apos;m not gonna say anything .
i &apos;m gonna let an old friend do the talking for me .
sting .
&quot; if you love somebody , set them free . &quot;
wise words , don &apos;t you think ?
you know what i think ?
what are you doing ? why would you do that ? ! who does that ? !
murray , what are you doing ? why are you in here ?
i had good intentions ! i went to my guy at sam goody .
his name is randy ,
and he &apos;s getting over someone , too .
she &apos;s a wild animal .
don &apos;t help ! get !
he &apos;s right .
look at me . i &apos;m an animal .
i &apos;m an animal .
stop that .
but -- - stop it !
lainey &apos;s birthday is tonight , and , damn it , you &apos;re going .
no way .
lainey &apos;s your best friend .
well , lainey &apos;s also friends with tracy ,
which means that drew will be there .
even better . and you want to know why ?
they are gonna freak
when you walk into that restaurant with a college guy .
what college guy ?
i was at dr . kaczander &apos;s office earlier ,
and it seems his son , bruce , is single and ready to mingle .
i am not going out
with your podiatrist &apos;s son named bruce .
he goes to penn , he &apos;s a classics major ,
and he drives a way cooler car than drew .
cooler than a mustang 5.0 ?
yes . a saab .
a saab ? what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s swedish . it &apos;s sporty .
it &apos;s got a key in the middle , next to the armrest .
it &apos;s like a spaceship .
drew is gonna see you with that college hunk ,
go crazy with jealousy ,
and regret treating you this way .
and with that ,
beverly goldberg &apos;s matchmaking skills saved the day .
amazingly , bruce , the podiatrist &apos;s son ,
was an uncanny mix
of patrick swayze and patrick dempsey .
not even drew kremp could deny it .
hi . this is bruce .
he &apos;s in college . look at him .
you ... can sit next to me .
scoot . scoot . down .
you must be lainey .
yes .
i brought you a little something for your birthday .
it &apos;s my favorite sake .
he has a favorite sake , yeah , and he drives a saab .
as erica &apos;s surprise for drew was paying off ,
pops and i had a surprise of our own for barry .
hey .
barry , please have a seat .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , w @-@ we &apos;re all here because we love you
and we care about you
and we want to see you get better .
it &apos;s an intervention .
we invited all your friends over to tell you how we feel .
but only roger &apos;s here .
i was the 10th person they called .
shut up , roger .
listen , you &apos;ve been spending way too much time at the arcade .
you &apos;re on edge .
you &apos;ve been neglecting your schoolwork .
you stopped showering .
who showers every day ? !
what am i , the governor ? ! this is ridiculous !
i don &apos;t have the problem . you have the problem .
what problem do we have ?
you &apos;re addicted to being jerks !
i can quit the arcade any time i want .
barry , you &apos;re scrounging around for quarters right now .
no , i &apos;m not .
i was looking for this fork .
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna eat coleslaw .
does that mean i &apos;m addicted to coleslaw , too ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t care anymore .
this whole thing &apos;s gotten very weird .
barry , please . you cashed in your bonds .
you emptied your piggy bank . you sold your baseball cards .
this arcade &apos;s eating you alive .
we care about you , dude .
we want you around for a long time .
roger ! go !
maybe you &apos;re right .
maybe i do have a problem .
there you go .
just know we &apos;re always here for you .
we love you , kiddo .
i won &apos;t let you down .
but he did .
and the first place barry went --
my room , in search of pocket change .
something . just something .
but what he found was way more valuable .
how much will you give me for this ?
three bucks .
what ?
i stole it from my brother . he said it &apos;s priceless .
oh , it &apos;s hot . sorry , i &apos;m not interested .
dude , what kind of weird , honest pawn shop is this ?
the grown @-@ up kind that sells things that grown @-@ ups want --
like engagement rings and guns .
come on . 10 bucks .
some nerd will pay top dollar for this .
really ? no landing gear .
the gun turret &apos;s cracked . and no radar disc .
how would this thing ever do the kessel run in 12 parsecs ?
i don &apos;t know what any of that means , okay ?
just give me a few quarters , and i &apos;ll go away .
as barry pawned away the last shred of his dignity ,
erica &apos;s date was really starting to sizzle .
would anyone like a refill on their soda ?
it &apos;s actually my 21st birthday .
so how about mai tais all around ?
well , the balloon says you &apos;re 17 , so how about no ?
well , i &apos;m not 17 .
eight mai tais , please . all for me .
it &apos;s been a tough week .
yeah , college is really hard &apos; cause he &apos;s in college .
now , who wants sake ?
no , thanks . i don &apos;t drink .
who brought the wet blanket ?
no , i don &apos;t drink when there &apos;s a table of cops next to us .
there &apos;s what now ?
i don &apos;t even know this girl , all right ?
my dad is her mom &apos;s podiatrist !
the only reason i agreed to go out with her
is &apos; cause he said i could use his saab !
well , that &apos;s a real sob story , am i right ?
you &apos;re such an ass , drew .
i love you .
what ?
nothing .
meanwhile , at the arcade ,
barry was jonesing to beat &quot; punch @-@ out ! ! &quot;
unfortunately , it was beating him .
focus , barry ! focus !
beat it , lyle . you &apos;re bad luck .
this was it -- the last quarter .
one final shot at glory .
what happened next was legendary .
yes ! yes !
that single quarter lasted barry 20 minutes .
go ! let &apos;s go !
he was a man possessed ,
knocking out glass joe , bald bull , pizza pasta .
there was no one who could take my brother down .
yes ! yes ! yes !
no one except ...
no !
... me .
what did you do ? !
what did you do ? ! my millennium falcon &apos;gone .
did you really think i wouldn &apos;t notice ? !
kind of .
why didn &apos;t you sell something of yours ,
like your signed moses malone jersey ?
dude , i could never sell that .
i &apos;d miss it too much .
you know what , even with all the crap you do ,
i still look up to you .
not anymore .
adam , wait .
it was game over for my brother .
he &apos;d hit rock bottom and finally ran out of options ...
and quarters .
after watching her date get arrested ,
erica had to call home for a ride .
there you are .
your mom and i couldn &apos;t decide
who you &apos;d be more annoyed to see .
we talked about it for a while , and here i am .
good .
&apos;cause i don &apos;t ever want to talk to her again .
stupid , beautiful podiatrist &apos;s son .
your mom means well .
um , we &apos;re not gonna be eating anything .
thank you . yeah .
but the thing is --
if you &apos;re gonna say another lame dad clich ?
i will literally press your face
against this hot , sizzling grill .
no , no , i believe you .
but i really want you to hear this .
hey , um , listen , you don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;m trying to talk to my --
is that shrimp ?
all right , you know what , i &apos;d love some shrimp ,
but keep the schtick down .
so , when i was your age ,
my first girlfriend dumped me out of the blue .
i spent the whole summer with the shades drawn ,
eating zagnut bars , and watching old horror movies .
i was miserable and heartbroken .
knock it off .
the point is that i know there &apos;s no easy fix here ,
but all you need is time .
how much time ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i promise you that one day you &apos;re gonna wake up ,
and it just won &apos;t hurt as much .
i hope so .
thanks , daddy .
really ? i helped you ? !
yeah , i am just as surprised as you are .
well , you &apos;re gonna be just fine .
you are . and just remember --
it &apos;s getting kind of loud , all right ?
it &apos;s still -- it &apos;s not , uh ...
i don &apos;t think he understands .
little did we know
erica wasn &apos;t the only one ready to accept some help .
hi .
my name is barry norman goldberg .
i &apos;m addicted to arcade games .
we don &apos;t want to hear it .
hey , cut him some slack , kiddo .
the first step is admitting you got a problem .
and i think i can help you .
there you go .
what the hell is that for ?
you love that boxing game , right ?
why not try the real thing ?
i don &apos;t know , pops .
it &apos;s not the same .
save you a lot of quarters .
i certainly don &apos;t look bad doing this .
what just happened ?
the trick with any addiction
is replacing it with a healthy alternative .
that &apos;s the thing about family --
no matter what , they &apos;re always there for you .
i know this may sound crazy ,
but i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m gonna become champion of the world .
even when you &apos;re at your worst .
well , how &apos;d it go ? was she mad ? how mad was she ?
does she hate her mama ?
huh , relax . i think she &apos;s starting to feel better .
this feels right !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
erica , stop .
really ?
what ? she &apos;s healing .
what is going on ? !
the wind !
we &apos;ll write you a check .
we &apos;ll write you a check .
sometimes you need them to bail you out .
and sometimes you need them to not say a thing .
they just need to be there .
turns out my dad was right .
all erica needed was a little time .
one day , she woke up and
it just didn &apos;t hurt anymore .
that &apos;s the great thing about first loves .
they &apos;re not the last .
and just like that ...
... the age of darkness was over .
as for barry , he went from scrounging for change ...
to making some changes .
i want to buy that spaceship back .
$ 50 .
i was afraid this might happen .
how much will you give me
for this signed moses malone jersey ?
my falcon ! you got it back ? !
dude ! get off me !
if you touch my torso again ,
i will smash your spaceship with my hands .
hey , chewbacca !
yo , nerd !
every rocky needs his mickey . come train me .
come on .
sure i got my millennium falcon back ,
but more importantly ...
... barry was back to being barry .
and this game of &quot; punch @-@ out ! ! &quot;
beat every arcade in town .
i &apos;m on filming now .
the ultimate in four @-@ wheel drive .
ginny , i think it &apos;s a good thing
that drew and erica didn &apos;t work out , you know ?
the last thing we need
is their relationship to come between us , you know ?
totally .
can i tell you something ,
but you have to promise not to tell another soul ?
i would never .
tracy kissed john martino .
drew is a mess ,
and now he won &apos;t even use his water @-@ park pass .
oh , my god .
so awful .
are you -- are you walking faster ?
no , are you slowing down ?
stop -- stop picking up the pace , bev .
stop it !
you are clearly going to tell erica !
i can &apos;t hear you . you &apos;re too far behind .
you &apos;re running !
you &apos;re running !
stop running !
this is just my natural gait .
