any family in the area ?
none to speak of .
marital status ?
seriously ?
you and sara are getting along again . maybe you eloped .
vegas is a little outside my radius .
do you have to fill that out right now ?
your commutation hearing is in a week .
i put this off as long as i could .
would you say you have a girlfriend ?
that &apos;s really on there ?
neal , the board is deciding
whether to release you from your anklet --
from me -- permanently .
they want to know who &apos;s in your life .
are they a good influence ,
or are they gonna steer you back to the dark side ?
and you think sara could be an angel on my shoulder ?
as opposed to that little devil
you have on your shoulder now .
mozzie &apos;s more of an imp than a devil .
but i was released into your custody .
ultimately , what you say at the hearing
will carry the most weight .
okay .
target approaching .
gordon taylor .
he sure knows how to make friends .
he &apos;s one of the most beloved cons in the world .
and no criminal record .
he &apos;s a pro .
makes me wonder if that would be you --
if you hadn &apos;t caught me ? i &apos;d like to think so .
if gordon taylor &apos;s in town ,
it means he &apos;s here to do a job .
he &apos;s a key suspect
in some of the biggest heists in the past decade .
antibes . that the location of his last job ?
no , that &apos;s his villa .
they say you can hear his parties
all the way across the mediterranean .
that &apos;s not true .
reminds me of college .
regardless , taylor is a contract thief .
we need to find out who hired him
and what they &apos;re planning to steal .
how is it taylor doesn &apos;t have a record ?
he has a saying --
&quot; nobody gets caught . everybody gets paid . &quot;
and so far , he &apos;s lived up to that .
he also has a very loyal following ,
and it helps that the public loves him .
even his victims say nice things .
check this out .
this was a heist he ran in paris .
he dove out of a second @-@ story window
onto this guy &apos;s peugeot .
two weeks later , taylor sends a check to the owner
to cover the damages .
claimed he heard about the car on the news .
because he &apos;s popular ,
it &apos;s difficult to find witnesses willing to talk .
he &apos;s careful , and he &apos;s smart . this isn &apos;t gonna be easy .
we need to find out what he &apos;s hitting and when .
he hires locally .
neal , talk to the street ,
figure out what kind of crew he &apos;s putting together .
diana , follow the money trail surrounding his trip .
jones , cover surveillance on the hotel .
i want intel on everyone he meets .
you got it .
boss , you got a minute ?
yeah .
can i speak freely ?
of course .
when agent kramer was here last week , he told me
he doesn &apos;t think neal deserves to have his sentence commuted .
kramer told you that ?
he wanted to know what i planned to say
when i testify at neal &apos;s hearing .
he didn &apos;t say anything to me .
he knows you consider neal a friend .
can i ask ...
what am i gonna say at the hearing ?
i haven &apos;t decided .
kramer &apos;s sending some of his people
to pick up neal &apos;s old prison letters .
his letters to kate ?
we always suspected they contained codes ,
but we could never crack them .
maybe he thinks he can .
give kramer what he wants .
if he asks me to go behind your back ?
i can &apos;t imagine he would .
if he does ?
if he does , do it .
but i want you to tell me about it .
i may be jeopardizing
a wonderful career opportunity back in d.c.
i thought christie hated d.c.
she does . and i work for you .
&quot; without leaps of imagination ,
you lose the excitement of possibility . &quot;
are you quoting gloria steinem ?
she &apos;s not just for feminists .
she has unlocked what &apos;s missing in our lives .
we need jobs .
if she only knew who she inspired .
she does .
but not any job . a good job . a big job .
i have to be careful
about taking those kind of jobs at the moment , okay ?
look , i know this is risky with your big hearing coming up ,
but this is too good to pass up .
you are looking at the first man hired
to be part of gordon taylor &apos;s next score .
no , no , no , moz . the fbi is after taylor .
peter and i are chasing down his crew .
me ! you &apos;re looking for me . i &apos;m his crew .
pull out . you &apos;re gonna get caught .
taylor never gets caught , and everybody gets paid !
have you already said yes ?
yeah , of course i did . no one says no to taylor .
and he asked me about you to be his possible point man .
he asked about me ?
point man .
all right , there &apos;s a way we can still do this ,
but you &apos;re gonna have to work with us .
&quot; us &quot; -- you mean the suits ?
yeah .
you &apos;re already in .
taylor &apos;s going down one way or another .
yeah , i don &apos;t want to be the one to bring him down .
look , if we do this right , no more anklet ,
no more prison . i &apos;ll be free , moz .
look , neal , i -- i want to help you .
r @-@ really , i do , but not in this way .
come on . the guy &apos;s a legend .
all right , how about this ? you keep your integrity intact .
you said taylor was asking about me , so set up the meeting .
then you &apos;ve done your part .
if he takes you on , i will not wear a wire ,
i will not testify , and i will not lie to taylor .
you won &apos;t have to . it &apos;ll be like we &apos;re really doing the job .
yeah , without the fun .
or the threat of prison .
like i said .
this case takes us home , moz .
home .
that &apos;s an apropos analogy , considering the target .
why ? what &apos;s the target ?
taylor &apos;s gonna hit yankee stadium ?
it &apos;s a good job .
got to hand it to you .
took you all of 24 hours to find out taylor &apos;s target .
well , not only that , but as an added bonus ,
i &apos;ve figured out a way to work mozzie into his crew .
really ?
are you in his crew ?
not yet .
but i &apos;m thinking that &apos;s the way to go on this one .
me and moz on the inside .
any idea what taylor &apos;s going after in there ?
nope .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re planning ,
but you are one week away from freedom ,
and you are really playing with fire here .
you &apos;re welcome .
let &apos;s go to the ballpark .
you &apos;re in a good mood .
my dad took me to a day game when i was 8 .
decided then and there i wanted to play for the yankees .
yeah , you and every other 8 @-@ year @-@ old at the game .
yeah . i did end up getting pretty good .
i &apos;m sure you did .
i imagine a shelf somewhere
loaded with little @-@ league trophies .
yankee stadium .
new house that ruth built .
new cathedral of baseball .
the new bronx zoo .
you must be geoffrey , head of security .
special agent peter burke .
neal caffrey .
thanks for the heads up .
looked over the file you sent .
he &apos;s never used a weapon or a threat of violence ?
no , but we can &apos;t relax .
we know taylor intends to strike somewhere in the stadium .
we &apos;re trying to identify the likely times and targets .
well , the vaults below are secure ,
but we handle millions in cash from concessions every game .
you should vary the pick @-@ up and drop @-@ off times .
and of course , the public has easy access to the museum .
i think we should see that for ourselves .
all right .
this is awesome .
okay .
you know , we can &apos;t even place a value
on most of these pieces of history .
they &apos;re each one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind .
is all your memorabilia in this room ?
well , most of it &apos;s concentrated in here ,
but we also have championship trophies
and retired jerseys throughout the building .
got to be millions of square feet to cover .
we should get blueprints .
slugger .
right .
could we trouble you for building plans
and a chart of the display cases and security camas ?
sure . why don &apos;t you wait here while i pull it all together ?
i , i get the feeling
you &apos;d like to look around a little more .
thanks , geoffrey .
sure .
go ahead .
being here , all this ...
reminds me of watching games with my dad .
your dad take you to a lot of games ?
no . mostly we &apos;d watch them on tv .
he &apos;d run an extension cord out to the porch ,
put on our yankee caps , crack open a beer .
way to go , dad .
well , root beer for me .
during commercials , we &apos;d throw the ball around .
sounds like something to go home for .
it is .
and when i go back , we still do it .
except now i drink real beer .
oh , man .
what i &apos;d pay to have that bat in my collection .
i bet it &apos;s a lot of money for that piece of wood .
&quot; piece of wood &quot; ?
yeah .
i mean , take away the fact that dimaggio swung it ,
it &apos;s just a bat .
but some guy named pollock can splatter paint on a canvas
and you think it &apos;s worth millions of dollars .
&quot; splatter paint on a canvas &quot; ?
you stand in front of one of pollock &apos;s works ,
the chaos fades away and you see the discipline ,
the balance of restraint and abandon .
like when dimaggio stepped up to the plate .
great art has a broader meaning .
it captures a time , a place , an emotion .
this bat was used to set the all @-@ time hit @-@ streak record
the same year hirohito bombed pearl harbor .
for four , five at @-@ bats a day ,
joltin &apos; joe let americans forget that we were going to war .
a time , a place , an emotion .
this bat , those balls , these pennants
got this country through some tough times .
they still do . gives us something to root for .
and if you work hard , swing for the fences ...
anything &apos;s possible .
that &apos;s how you feel about baseball ?
that &apos;s how a lot of people feel about baseball .
yankees security is sending over more surveillance footage .
great . where &apos;s caffrey ?
prepping for his audition for taylor &apos;s crew .
a bit like putting a drink in the hands of an alcoholic .
reformed alcoholic , i know .
and it &apos;s more like a bottle .
but putting caffrey side by side with someone like taylor
is the best way to nail him .
here &apos;s some surveillance from the hotel .
yes , i know . it &apos;s mozzie .
he &apos;s neal &apos;s in .
how convenient
so long as he stays on our side , we don &apos;t ask questions .
we &apos;ve granted mozzie immunity .
to preserve his street cred ,
you want us to arrest him if we catch him ?
and make it look real .
oh , i will .
same for caffrey .
taylor knows a lot about neal , but our backstop has held up .
that he was released two years ago
but remains a person of interest
in a number of elegant high @-@ profile crimes .
any other questions ?
good . let &apos;s make the yankees proud .
billiards . couldn &apos;t be a better audition .
don &apos;t get cocky . the man is unparalleled .
he has won the taylor world championship
so many times they named the tournament after him .
are you jealous ?
i &apos;m ecstatic for him .
it gives me hope knowing
that taylor and his villa on the french riviera even exist .
of course i want to be him .
i assume his game is eight ball .
it is .
winning is important , but more so ,
he says he can learn everything he needs to know about you
by how you play pool .
how competitive you are ,
what risks you take , your level of confidence ...
did you get any more info on what he &apos;s after ?
taylor is true to his rep .
he promises no details until the game is afoot .
it &apos;s a good way to keep a crew honest .
yeah . we could learn a lot from him .
and when you meet him , he &apos;s gonna give you a big bear hug
it seems like he &apos;s just being effusive , because he is .
but what he &apos;s really doing is -- - giving me the pat @-@ down .
exactly .
got it .
that must be your cue .
to do what ?
no , i mean your new cue .
hello .
hi , june .
now , while i still have serious reservations about your participation ,
i felt compelled to give you the best shot at success .
gentlemen , may i present lord byron .
june , i love you .
i mean , byron must have run the tables with this .
you know , for some reason , every great con man in the world
needs to master the game of pool at some point in his life .
i was 9 years old .
there was a pool hall on my way home from school .
a pool hall in st. louis , missouri .
must have been full of hustlers .
yeah . i was one of them .
neal .
thank you .
hi , peter .
hi , sara .
what &apos;s going on ,
aside from that mustard stain about to happen ?
thank you . can i get you anything ?
no .
here you go .
no , that &apos;s all right .
the board is putting together a list of character witnesses
for neal &apos;s commutation hearing .
i &apos;m sorry -- his what ?
he didn &apos;t mention that to you ?
no .
commutation hearing ? so neal might be set free ?
it &apos;s possible .
and why would they do that ?
after keller &apos;s arrest , the board of corrections
recommended an early release for neal .
well , good for him .
yeah .
only caffrey , huh ?
well , could be . it &apos;s far from settled .
how do you think it &apos;s gonna go ?
the board knows that you testified against neal at his trial
yes -- i was very upset about that raphael back then .
but somehow , you were able to get past that
far enough to start dating him .
so if i testify , my relationship with neal
is likely to come up as public record ?
it might get a little uncomfortable .
no , no , no . it &apos;s not the relationship , peter .
it &apos;s why we broke up that poses the problem .
i &apos;m gonna assume pleading the fifth
is not ideal at these hearings .
no . no , it &apos;s not .
honestly , i don &apos;t know where neal and i stand right now .
you might want to think about it .
here comes your 2 : 00 .
neal caffrey .
welcome .
so , uh , you &apos;re a pool player .
yeah , i like to play .
of course , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m in your league .
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out , isn &apos;t there ?
let me just finish up .
you &apos;re up .
so , neal , tell me about yourself .
when did you get out ?
18 months and 17 days ago ,
not that i &apos;ve been counting .
i &apos;ve never been to the big house , myself .
it does not look like fun .
it certainly forced me to be more cautious .
i can tell .
you haven &apos;t given me very many choices .
c &apos;est la vie .
so what do you think , neal ?
let the boss win so you can get the job ?
absolutely not .
correct . i prefer honesty over ass @-@ kissing .
thought you might appreciate the challenge .
of course , i don &apos;t mind the occasional puckering up .
excellent effort .
except you &apos;ve left yourself with no shot .
eight ball , corner pocket . what if i can make that shot ?
i don &apos;t think you can .
if i make that shot right now , will you hire me on the spot ?
listen , neal , you play aggressively , but with grace .
you think ahead , and if half of what i &apos;ve heard
about the u @-@ boat treasure is true ,
then i definitely want you on my team .
but you &apos;re over @-@ reaching ,
and that is a very bad sign .
i can make the shot .
you make it , you &apos;re in . you miss , you walk out the door .
welcome aboard .
same place tomorrow morning , we &apos;ll go over the plan .
i &apos;ll be there .
it &apos;s open .
neal .
sara .
this is a surprise .
yeah , today is that kind of day .
you need my help on another case ?
no .
peter told me about your commutation hearing .
yeah . that .
yeah , that . congratulations .
thank you .
how long have you known about it ?
a while .
yeah ?
you didn &apos;t say anything about it when we ... reconnected .
yeah .
look , i didn &apos;t bring it up
because i didn &apos;t want to ask you to appear at the hearing .
you didn &apos;t trust what i would say ?
no . we worked together , and it went really well .
yeah , i thought so .
i didn &apos;t want you to think it was
because i needed you to say nice things about me .
i appreciate that .
don &apos;t do it again .
what ?
neal , what are we doing right now ?
talking ?
yes , we &apos;re talking . we &apos;re being open with each other .
that is what we need to do .
i don &apos;t need you to protect me
by hiding things from me , all right ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s where we got tripped up last time .
that , and a multi @-@ billion @-@ dollar u @-@ boat treasure ,
you know , explosion .
all right . tonight , you and i are gonna talk .
not about your hearing , but we are gonna talk .
what do we talk about ?
everything .
quid pro quo .
i am an open book .
really ?
i think i know where to start .
of course you do .
how many other former fiances do you have ?
and do they all practice tai chi ?
stop it . it was just the one .
really ?
it was the one .
are you sure ?
is your real name neal ?
that is a very long story .
it sounds like a really good story .
it &apos;s really boring , and i &apos;d prefer it , frankly ,
if you started with something a little more innocuous .
gonna have to work into it ?
yeah .
hi !
good morning .
peter will be down in just a second . come on in .
you , want some breakfast ?
i would love some .
good .
thank you .
this place looks great , by the way .
thanks !
you &apos;re , uh , awfully chipper this morning .
so are you .
el , you are a tigress ! a tigress !
honey !
i know when you --
hey , neal . you grab some breakfast ?
hey . i &apos;m not hungry anymore .
you &apos;re early .
i &apos;m excited to get started on this case .
excited to work with taylor ?
excited to bring taylor to justice .
have you ever heard of robert withrow jr . ?
wealthy , entitled son of robert withrow sr. ,
and owner of the withrow hotel ?
the one and only .
diana followed taylor &apos;s money trail back to him .
that would explain why he &apos;s staying at the withrow hotel .
his passion for baseball raised some eyebrows .
he collects priceless baseball memorabilia .
the yankees say he &apos;s tried to buy
some of their most significant pieces over the years .
but they &apos;re not willing to sell . enter taylor .
exactly .
that &apos;s geoffrey , from the yankees .
why don &apos;t you finish your breakfast ,
then we &apos;ll wire you .
geoffrey , good news .
i never realized how much peter loves baseball .
well , you know , the twins drafted him .
wait , he played pro ?
he had an amazing slider .
played in the minors right after college .
and two weeks into spring training ,
i blew out my rotator cuff .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
i thought neal knew .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m gonna finish getting ready . you guys , have a good day .
all right .
love you .
love you .
see you .
so , that &apos;s it , huh ?
you only got to play for two weeks ?
i went under the knife , and they were able to repair it .
three months later ,
i was back in the rotation with the triple @-@ a club .
so you still had the slider ?
yeah , but that was the problem .
i could throw it , but the doctors said
if i continued , i &apos;d destroy my arm for good .
that was in my head every time i pitched .
so i left .
i had a choice -- i could continue down that path
or find a new passion .
it &apos;s a tough call to make .
you never look back and wish you played in the majors ?
of course i do .
there &apos;s no bigger dream than playing in the show .
standing on that mound , right in the middle of the stadium ,
listening to the crowd chant your name .
in hindsight , if i &apos;d kept playing ,
i would have destroyed my arm .
then i never would have been able to pass the fbi physical .
and i never would have caught you .
come on . time for our show .
caffrey &apos;s anklet &apos;s off ,
he &apos;s wired , and inside the billiard room .
jones , when you played ball ,
did you ever imagine having walk @-@ out music ?
you know , walk @-@ out music ,
to get the crowd going when you walk out to the mound .
yeah , i know what it is .
i never set my sights that high . i take it you did .
&quot; i go to work , &quot; except it &apos;d be &quot; i go to burke . &quot;
kool moe dee ? really ?
yeah . yeah . i was a closer .
&quot; i go to burke . &quot; that &apos;s definitely old @-@ school .
it works .
yeah , it works . uh , they &apos;re in .
as i of yours . that thing at the del monico a few months back
was that just neal , or was it the both of you ?
he &apos;s not one to brag .
i respect that .
it was me , not him .
looks like our cover story &apos;s working .
they think caffrey was involved
with the del monico diamond heist .
you know , kramer actually asked me about it .
he ask you anything about neal &apos;s old prison letters ?
diana said he &apos;s sending a team in to scour them for codes .
no , just about neal &apos;s old crimes .
by the end of the conversation , he had me thinking twice
over whether we &apos;d be doing the bureau and caffrey
any favors by letting him out early .
mozzie , they were out of the gosset brut ,
so i had them open a grand cuvee &apos; 96 .
oh . &apos; 96 grand cuvee .
my usual .
neal , i know how much you love the caspian osetra caviar
so they &apos;re bringing up an ounce .
much appreciated .
you think this is what his life will be like ?
who ? neal ?
when his anklet &apos;s off .
there is that chance we &apos;ll be hearing this same conversation
yeah , only then it &apos;ll be a lot harder to monitor him .
robert .
let &apos;s talk outside .
no , that &apos;s nonsense .
i wanted to see what my money &apos;s bought me .
gentlemen .
what &apos;s going on ?
this is a friend of mine .
i &apos;m your boss . who are you ?
what &apos;s going on over there ?
this is a jammer .
without it , we only talk about the weather .
every frequency &apos;s killed .
we almost had withrow and taylor on tape .
instead we &apos;re out here with nothing .
ok , here is the deal .
the only thing i know about you guys
is that you &apos;re a bunch of professional thieves ,
so i &apos;m sure you won &apos;t take it personally
when i say that i don &apos;t trust any one of you .
but you hired me .
it &apos;s my job to deliver on our agreement .
and i know that you will ,
because paul here &apos;s gonna make sure by going with you .
this isn &apos;t working for me .
guns get you caught , hurt , 10 to life .
no guns . no outsiders .
it &apos;s non @-@ negotiable .
then this is where we part company . no hard feelings .
gentlemen , thank you very much indeed .
i &apos;ll be in touch shortly to pay you for your time .
i hope we can work together again soon .
hold on . hold on . you can &apos;t just walk out of here .
they know who i am .
that &apos;s because you waltzed in here
and introduced yourself to everybody .
nobody &apos;s leaving .
robert , please .
neal .
if the feds can &apos;t hear us ,
this may turn into the last 10 minutes of a tarantino film .
if they could hear us , they &apos;d be here already .
yeah , and we die in a slow @-@ motion hail of bullets
while nancy sinatra plays ironically in the background .
all right , don &apos;t zip up your boots yet , nancy .
excuse me , gentlemen .
it &apos;s all right , neal . i &apos;ve got it under control .
understood , but i just had a thought .
it seems to me if mr. withrow trusts paul ,
then we should trust him , too .
use him as our breaker ,
so long as he doesn &apos;t change the plan .
and taylor has a good reason for the no @-@ guns rule .
stadium security does not mess around .
we &apos;d need weeks of additional preparation ,
and even then , it &apos;s not worth the risk .
paul joins us , but we leave the weapons here .
that &apos;s just my two cents .
are you willing to put paul on your crew ?
i &apos;ve got men on every exit . what now ?
keep monitoring from here in case they come back online .
i &apos;m gonna check in with yankees security
to get an op order for today &apos;s game .
i have a feeling this is going down soon .
we &apos;ll let you know the moment they move .
great .
yankee stadium . the museum .
what &apos;s our target ?
george herman ruth &apos;s first official home run ball ,
hit against the yankees on may 6 , 1915 , at the polo grounds .
it &apos;s priceless , not for sale .
mozzie , you &apos;re first up . how &apos;d the hunt go ?
oh , good . this ball is from 1921 .
excellent .
your job will be to detail this to perfection .
neal , how &apos;s the babe ruth signature ?
he couldn &apos;t tell us apart .
that &apos;s what i like to hear .
when mozzie &apos;s finished , you sign the ball .
then at the stadium , you make the switch .
they &apos;re gonna catch on it &apos;s a forgery .
yeah , neal &apos;s right -- i can make this passable ,
but an expert will nix this on closer observation .
exactly .
we want them to know that it &apos;s stolen ,
just after we &apos;re gone .
duran , you &apos;re gonna play lookout
while smitty sets up the video feed .
paul -- trustworthy paul --
you now have the most important job .
you &apos;ll pretend to admire the babe ruth ball ...
smash the glass ...
and run away , leaving the ball there .
security will pursue .
that would be me .
and neal will switch out the real ball for the fake ball .
and meet me in the upper @-@ deck hallway
in a camera @-@ blind spot to make the pass .
and then you &apos;ll give me the ball at parking k @-@ 5 .
exactly .
neal ...
nice watch .
thank you .
take it off .
you &apos;re a security guard . they don &apos;t wear $ 5,000 watches .
in fact , all of you , cellphones , watches ,
communication devices in the bucket .
from now on , no outside contact .
thanks for the update , diana .
kramer &apos;s people are here .
i wasn &apos;t invited in .
you let me know if you hear anything .
peter , i &apos;ve got the op order .
they &apos;ve approved two additional teams .
all right . great .
if we don &apos;t hear from caffrey in two hours , we move in .
yes , sir .
sara .
peter .
is this a bad time ?
what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve made a decision .
the burnt amber is calibrated ever so slightly warm .
here . practice .
i need to get a message to peter .
he &apos;s inspiring , neal .
he &apos;s skilled , strategic , magnanimous ...
commutation , moz .
i thought a lot about what you said ,
and i want to testify on his behalf .
okay . the cost of freedom .
what do you want the note to say ?
i &apos;ll hide it under the stitching .
we talked . a lot .
and ...
while he is never going to be a model citizen ,
he &apos;s also not the brazen thief that he was six years ago
when i went after him for that raphael .
excuse me .
yeah .
yeah , jones . what &apos;s up ?
tail them and stay low . i &apos;m on my way .
what &apos;s going on ?
neal &apos;s about to rob yankee stadium .
gather &apos; round , gentlemen . it &apos;s game time .
i want to see this ball that i &apos;m paying for .
i don &apos;t want any of you walking out with the real one
when i &apos;m stuck with the fake .
let &apos;s see .
mozzie ?
of course .
fingerprints . come right over there .
if they find peter &apos;s note ,
then cue up nancy sinatra .
it &apos;s good .
wait , what &apos;s this ? the two red stitches in a row .
t @-@ that &apos;s for your benefit .
it &apos;ll fool most of the experts ,
and of course it &apos;s not on the real ball .
so you &apos;ll be able to tell the difference .
nice work , mozzie .
i knew you were the man for the job .
all right , gentlemen . let &apos;s go .
peter . game on .
diana , i &apos;m at the stadium , what &apos;s our status ?
we got this place covered .
any sign of taylor and his crew ?
they &apos;re here , used the v.i.p. entrance .
taylor and mozzie are holed up in the delta suite .
is withrow with them ?
negative . we believe he &apos;s still at the hotel .
what about neal and the others ?
they spread out in the crowd .
geoffrey &apos;s got extra men at every hot point we identified ,
so as soon as they surface , we got &apos; em .
all right . i &apos;ll meet you in five .
here &apos;s the pitch . right on schedule .
they may be on to us .
looks like there &apos;s additional security .
guess we &apos;ll have to give them someone to catch .
batter up .
hey ! stop right there ! get him !
i confess . i confess .
we &apos;ve got a vandal in the museum .
secure the room .
no , no . i got it . you guys can take him in .
all right , everybody . clear out of here , please .
okay ? can you back up ? thank you .
looks like he broke clean through the glass .
get everybody out of here .
runners on the corners .
like clockwork .
i @-@ i have to tell you , mr. taylor ,
this is a first @-@ class operation from top to bottom .
well , you and neal are a pleasure to work with .
you &apos;re not having nearly enough fun , mozzie .
i cloak anxiety with indifference and reserved chatter .
you know , i might have some work coming up later in the summer
how do you feel about paris ?
j &apos;adore paris , mon frere .
good .
good .
you &apos;re up .
i don &apos;t know anything about any heist !
last chance . you sure ?
i accidentally bumped into the case .
get him out of here .
well , he &apos;s got to be the decoy .
this just doesn &apos;t add up .
i mean , why didn &apos;t he take the ball ?
because he left it for someone else to take .
i want to see the ball that &apos;s in that case now .
all right .
i &apos;m on deck .
okay . good luck .
thanks . see you around .
agent berrigan , someone &apos;s approaching the suite .
description ?
5 &apos; 10 , &quot; brown hair , slender build ,
wearing a jacket and cap .
moving in now .
i &apos;m sorry ! i &apos;m sorry !
false alarm .
they just don &apos;t have the bats to put runs on the board .
come on , peter .
what do you make of that ?
the pattern on the stitching &apos;s off .
yep . it &apos;s supposed to
consistently alternate red , blue , red , blue .
this patch here , it &apos;s red and red .
is that a common mistake ?
no . but i &apos;ll have to check this ball &apos;s documentation .
you know , it &apos;s nearly 100 years old .
that &apos;ll take too long .
what are you doing ?
bear with me .
wait !
i can &apos;t believe you did that .
thank you , neal .
we don &apos;t have much time . come on .
caffrey took a real chance writing a message in that ball
neal may be the expert
in spotting forged paintings and bearer bonds --
and gems .
antiquities , counterfeit money .
pretty much any kind of document .
anyway , baseball &apos;s my thing .
there &apos;s withrow .
there it is . go . go .
fbi ! hands in the air !
i was just scalping tickets .
taylor , turn around slowly .
i &apos;ll take that .
careful with that thing , man . it &apos;s priceless .
yeah , it &apos;s gonna cost you four to six years .
i have a well @-@ maintained reputation as a crook .
make my arrest look real .
say &quot; ow &quot;
ow !
where &apos;s taylor ?
he called an audible and sent us instead .
did neal tip him off ?
now , that &apos;s an ungrateful thank @-@ you
from the cynical eyes of the law .
have you ever considered
there are some criminals who are too smart to get caught ?
no .
pig !
what are you doing , moz ?
pantomiming his wholly unexpected capture , i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s not just the new york summer heat .
the air thickens when things don &apos;t feel right .
mozzie said something , didn &apos;t he ?
16万美金
everyone gets paid .
always on my team
i hope this little operation of yours
has built up enough good will
that you &apos;ll be joining mozzie in paris in a few months .
you still think i &apos;m a thief ?
fish don &apos;t do well out of water .
agent berrigan , i think you should take a look at this .
neal coded his letters .
and we cracked it .
don &apos;t know what they mean yet , but we will .
they cracked neal &apos;s letter code to kate .
this isn &apos;t good .
coming .
thought we were meeting at the office .
can i come in ?
sure . come on in .
you okay ? you seem a little tense .
yeah , just got some things on my mind ...
one of which is taylor .
how do you think he got away ?
he runs a pretty good game .
he does . you want to know what i think ?
sure .
he &apos;s not the most brilliant criminal ,
and his thefts aren &apos;t high @-@ tech .
but he knows people .
i think he charmed mozzie ,
the same way he does everybody else , and in the end ,
mozzie liked him too much to see him get caught .
that &apos;s one theory .
but you got withrow .
and you saved the baseball .
which reminds me , i got something for you .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;m okay .
get ready .
what ?
that &apos;s my rookie card .
sure is .
you know , i got to say , knowing you played pro ball ,
i don &apos;t know , made me see you in a whole new light .
really ?
yeah .
there &apos;s a lot more to peter burke than i know .
how did you get this ?
i have my ways .
i got something else for you , too ,
for saving a piece of baseball history .
come on . you &apos;re gonna love it .
can i keep this ?
sure .
not that expensive .
how did you arrange this ?
i have my ways .
you ready ?
yep .
let &apos;s go to burke .
i &apos;m standing on the pitcher &apos;s mound ... in yankee stadium .
i know .
thank you .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you played pro ?
there are things in the past that live in the past .
not my life anymore .
some of the things we &apos;ve done are pretty hard to forget .
honestly , peter ...
do i have a shot at commutation ?
you know , the one thing that i took away from my injury is
that , on days like this ,
don &apos;t worry about the future or the past .
enjoy the moment ?
yeah .
yeah .
got some sauce on it !
all right , are you ready ?
i &apos;m ready .
here comes the heat .
