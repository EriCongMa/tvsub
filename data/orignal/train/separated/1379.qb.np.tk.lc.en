jerk !
yeah !
yeah !
those begonias are annuals , you jerk !
there &apos;s a boy in the lane .
yes , mom , he &apos;ll move .
it don &apos;t look like he &apos;s moving .
thank you , mother .
thank you for signing for this .
i got caught up at the clinic last night .
yeah , sure .
how are you liking working with the living , by the way ?
you know , it &apos;s incredible .
i assisted with a caesarean .
just couldn &apos;t resist cutting something open , huh ?
it was the obstetrician &apos;s call .
you brought life into the world . i signed for a package .
my god ! is there anything we can &apos;t do ?
what is that , anyway ?
well , you know how you can never recognize me
at my fencing tournaments ?
yeah , &apos; cause you all look like giant tampons in face masks ?
i ordered a custom sabre guard
so that you could pick me out of the crowd .
oh.yes.
i &apos;m quite sure the ladies at the club
will not appreciate this .
well , when they are distracted , the advantage is mine .
en garde .
is that how you did your caesarean ?
just like that .
no !
your chariot to logan awaits .
is it that time al-- fine , i &apos;ll get my stuff .
okay , she &apos;s acting like i &apos;m taking her to jail .
you have no idea how hard it was to convince her
to accept the fbi &apos;s invitation to lecture at quantico .
first class trip to d.c. ?
teaching a class of fbi trainees ?
what &apos;s not to be excited about ?
it &apos;s economy and a middle seat .
and that &apos;s probably going to be the highlight
of the entire trip .
you get to share your vast experience
with a class of fbi trainees .
yes , and in my vast experience ,
the words &quot; fbi &quot; and &quot; sharing &quot; don &apos;t really go together .
all right , well , this isn &apos;t a case you &apos;re working .
approach it in the spirit of education and cooperation .
and reciprocation ,
because the fbi &apos;s gonna owe me huge after this .
rizzoli .
isles .
that just doesn &apos;t sound right .
that &apos;s messed up .
fatal collision ?
bike playing chicken with an suv .
driver managed to stop in time ,
but all of a sudden , the bicyclist exploded .
excuse me ?
that &apos;s what they &apos;re telling us .
well , the shock of having caused a traffic fatality
could prompt the mind to invent a less culpable narrative .
this narrative was given by two additional witnesses .
they &apos;re gonna work with a sketch artist down at the station .
ah , they got a look at the suspect ?
nobody saw a suspect .
they &apos;re giving a description of the victim .
why would we need a sketch of the the ...
oh . got it .
the degree of these burns could make fingerprinting impossible .
yeah , there was no id in the backpack either .
that &apos;s in better shape than our victim .
i &apos;m guessing the bomb isn &apos;t in there ?
we &apos;re not sure there was a bomb .
my team has yet to find a detonator or a casing
consistent with any sort of conventional explosive .
bag &apos;s clean . csru can have it .
thank you .
could this guy have been struck by lightning ?
the burns all appear thermal in nature ,
so you can rule out electricity as the source .
no suspect , no bomb , no act of god .
we could have a case of spontaneous human combustion .
i &apos;m pretty sure the human body
doesn &apos;t just blow up for no reason .
maura .
sorry , frankie .
every investigated incident of spontaneous human combustion
involved an overlooked external ignition source .
we need to figure out what the source was here .
spontaneous combustion , and i &apos;m missing it ?
maura says it &apos;s technically not a real thing ,
but this could be the one time she &apos;s wrong , right ?
it &apos;s the first time maura &apos;s wrong , and i &apos;m missing it ? !
i gotta go .
detective rizzoli .
hi .
pleasure to finally meet you in person .
hi , agent davies . thank you for having me .
oh , no . thanks for coming .
agent dean bet me i &apos;d never get you out of boston .
well , you made a great sales pitch .
promised him i wouldn &apos;t let you turn into a pumpkin .
okay , well , have me home before midnight .
yes , ma &apos;am .
what &apos;s going on over there ?
don &apos;t know . she &apos;s been at it all morning .
hey . you looking for a new job ?
oh , no , just going over current events .
with a highlighter ? what , is there a quiz later ?
fine . i &apos;m looking for an apartment .
for who ?
me .
okay , did something happen with maura ?
no , everything is as great as it &apos;s always been .
well , since i got my ged ,
i &apos;ve got a new perspective on life .
i &apos;m an adult.i don &apos;t wanna be crashing at somebody else &apos;s place .
it &apos;s not like you &apos;re sleeping on her couch .
maura won &apos;t care .
i care .
and please , don &apos;t say anything until i find a place .
i don &apos;t want her talking me out of it .
fine . you &apos;re the adult .
oh , the best places are online .
none of the neighbors recognize our victim
from the eyewitness sketch .
and there was nothing at the scene
to help identify him , either .
everything was too damaged from the fire .
dental records ?
no match in ncic &apos;s database for missing persons .
the only thing i could determine is that it &apos;s a white male ,
20 to 25 years old ,
and the cause of death being severe blast injury .
i just got the dna results back from the victim &apos;s body .
are we any closer to identifying him ?
it &apos;s hard to tell , really .
it says here that the sample came
from the interior thoracic cage just behind the sternum .
because that &apos;s where i took it from .
yeah .
that is the interior thoracic cage behind the sternum .
and you used an ultra @-@ flocked swab ?
like i &apos;ve done a thousand times before .
kent , are you trying to say that the test was inconclusive ?
maybe a little bit too conclusive .
what does that even mean ?
well , it means that our test didn &apos;t return
one dna profile from our victim &apos;s body .
it returned five .
i ran a sketch of our victim through facial recognition ,
but it returned 10,000 possible matches .
any one could be our guy .
or our guys .
well , the victim &apos;s body had , like ,
five different dna profiles , right ?
maybe he just had a blood transfusion ... or four .
or maybe our bicyclist
was really five little rascals under a trench coat .
then let &apos;s hope alfalfa &apos;s a violent felon .
i submitted all five profiles to codis .
maybe there &apos;ll be a match to our victim or killer .
well , don &apos;t be so quick to assume there is a killer .
again with the spontaneous human combustion ?
i &apos;m just saying it &apos;s possible .
well , hopefully , you &apos;ll stop saying it .
according to wikipedia , the jury &apos;s still out .
there is not enough time in the day
to keep that site honest .
further analysis of the victim &apos;s wounds
indicate that the explosive came from below the body .
wait a minute .
this is the same model bike that our victim was riding .
and look what &apos;s below the seat .
a water bottle mount .
if an explosive was in the bottle ,
someone could &apos;ve planted it long before our victim
even got on his bike .
so ... not spontaneous human combustion ?
more like murder .
i &apos;ll have kent test the water bottle pieces
for any explosive residue .
and facial recognition gave you all those results ?
the sketch may look like our victim to the human eye ,
but if it &apos;s off by even a few millimeters ,
the software can think it &apos;s a different person .
the sketch is just too imprecise .
i may be able to help with that .
how &apos;s it look ?
give me one more pass on the left @-@ hand side .
nice job getting your hands on this , kent .
my pleasure .
although , my mate at the v.a. was rather curious
as to why the coroner &apos;s office required
a medical grade 3d scanner .
i just told him that we were fitting a corpse
for a pair of prosthetic legs .
well , then i hope you told him what we &apos;re really doing .
what ? and dispel my carefully crafted
air of mystique and whimsy ?
dr. isles , i thought you knew me better than that .
okay , how does it look now ?
looks like my granny &apos;s wig stand .
all right . let &apos;s map the eyewitness sketch on it .
okay .
move the eyes on the socket .
mouth up .
there ?
just add some skin tone .
some hair color .
and here &apos;s johnny !
... doe .
okay , send that to nina . nice work .
well , if it isn &apos;t the fbi &apos;s most wanted instructor .
how &apos;s quantico ?
it &apos;s fine . show me the handlebars .
you &apos;ve been talking to frankie .
are the arms really still attached ?
you know , i find your interest in this a bit grotesque .
show me !
oh , so gross .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m missing it !
and i can &apos;t believe you packed khakis and a polo ?
no , no , i didn &apos;t . it --
agent davies thought it would be good for me
to dress like the trainees , so it ...
you &apos;re considering it ? is he cute ?
tell me about this agent davies .
no , it -- he &apos;s ...
huge , huge blue eyes , and i ...
no , he &apos;s fbi . whatever . are you kidding ?
and honestly , i would wear a clown suit
if i thought it would help .
please listen to these people that i &apos;m supposed to teach .
okay , ready ?
valedictorian . doctor of psychology .
rhodes scholar . really ?
but you chase killers on a daily basis .
i don &apos;t think a few straight- &quot; a &quot; students
could possibly scare you .
no , i &apos;m not scared . but i just ...
how am i gonna connect to a bunch of overachieving millennials ?
well , don &apos;t forget , you &apos;re an overachiever , too .
you &apos;ve got it in you . no clown costume required .
thank you .
i &apos;m gonna go write my talk or speech , whatever it is .
and i think kent needs you .
oh . i , uh , didn &apos;t wanna interrupt .
that &apos;d be rude , right ?
okay . bye !
bye , jane !
well ?
oh ! yeah . nina .
she already identified our bicyclist
from the image that we sent over .
see ? pixar &apos;s got nothing on us .
booyah .
don &apos;t leave me hangin &apos; .
awkward .
and the classroom &apos;s hooked up with a projector
for any audio / video needs .
should i have audio / video needs ?
totally optional .
j. edgar hoover didn &apos;t have audio / video needs .
yes , but i heard he had a fabulous dress collection .
we don &apos;t make those jokes here .
i &apos;m sorry .
his high heel collection was really the thing to see .
sorry , detective . one moment .
yeah .
davies .
have you seen her cases ? she &apos;s like a super cop .
yeah , in boston .
they couldn &apos;t have found one guy on the federal level
to teach this stuff ?
sorry , again .
shall we ?
yeah .
i can see why someone would want to kill robert hall
for his sweet bachelor pad .
what does this guy do for a living ?
nina didn &apos;t find a current employer .
he had a razer vr headset .
his parents mentioned bankrolling him when you spoke ?
the opposite .
when he dropped out of high school and got arrested
for drug possession , they tried to get him clean .
but when he ran away from rehab the second time ,
they cut him off completely .
well , maybe he &apos;s trying to turn his life around .
no arrests in the last year , so it &apos;s possible .
even so , how does a kid with no job
who &apos;s been cut off from his family afford all this ?
he was an entrepreneur .
why do you say that ?
meth lab gave it away .
all in all , we seized nearly $ 20,000 in cash
and 4 pounds of crystal meth at robert hall &apos;s apartment .
if someone killed him over drugs or money ,
why not take the drugs or money ?
i paid a visit to detective o &apos;connell .
the drug unit &apos;s seen an influx of high purity meth
the last 12 months .
they think this kitchen turned meth lab &apos;s the source .
it &apos;s sophisticated enough . just one problem .
hall &apos;s equipment has barely been used .
how does a high school dropout know how to build
a sophisticated meth lab ?
i already checked hall &apos;s old chemistry teacher.he &apos;s clean .
but maybe he had help from
one of the other little rascals in the trench coat .
codis got a match for one of the five dna profiles
found on the body .
david yao , aka big yao .
leader of a small @-@ time street gang .
aggravated assault , armed robbery ,
drug trafficking .
maybe hall learned to cook meth from a more experienced partner .
a partner wouldn &apos;t be too happy to discover that he was
setting up his own shop at home .
i &apos;ll talk to drug unit ,
have them set up a talk with big yao .
obviously , if you can find a web site
that tells you a guy who blinks too much is lying ,
well , then , your suspect can as well .
but you &apos;re all very smart individuals .
you probably already know that .
okay ...
the reason that i didn &apos;t go to a 4 @-@ year college was that ...
i just -- i just dreaded the thought of having to listen
to a teacher drone on and on .
i @-@ i wanted to get out there . i wanted to do it for myself .
so let &apos;s do that .
instead of talking about an interrogation ,
why don &apos;t we just -- just do one ?
you .
kyle price .
i didn &apos;t even have to ask a question .
come on over here , kyle . have a seat .
don &apos;t worry . i won &apos;t hurt you .
all right .
so , kyle , tell me about your hobbies .
i like watching movies .
okay , like , like tough guy movies ?
yeah .
all right .
and be honest ,
when was the last time that you took your fake gun
and &quot; taxi driver &quot; ed in the bathroom mirror ?
never .
are you embarrassed by it ?
no .
so you &apos;re not embarrassed ?
well , no , that &apos;s not what i meant .
agent davies ,
could you fire up that projector for me , please ?
what are you doing ?
well , this place is crawling with cameras .
you didn &apos;t ...
you didn &apos;t think that they missed the bathroom , too , did you ?
i don &apos;t believe you .
more importantly , kyle , i don &apos;t believe you .
so what are we gonna find on that video ?
all right , all right , stop . all right , don &apos;t do it .
i didn &apos;t &quot; taxi driver . &quot;
i &quot; dirty harry &quot; ed .
when you establish a connection with your suspect ,
it opens the door for a tactic like deception .
really ? cameras in the bathroom ?
all right , we &apos;re just getting started .
you know , the best thing about a uniform
is that you can wear them a few days in a row
without anybody noticing . am i right ?
i always wash my clothes , detective .
let &apos;s talk about what you &apos;re afraid of .
nothing .
there is no way
that anyone sticks to the arbitrary curfew rules .
the rules are here for a reason .
my brother &apos;s a grown @-@ ass man , and he is afraid of spiders .
no , no , like , you don &apos;t have to be embarrassed about it .
like , we all slept in our clothes once in a while .
this is not a lie -- i actually shot myself ,
and i am not ashamed to say ,
i don &apos;t ever want that to happen again .
not afraid of bullets .
i guess i &apos;ve gone a couple days before .
really ? without changing your underwear ?
that &apos;s minimization .
when you convince someone that it &apos;s not a crime ,
watch how quickly they &apos;ll admit to it .
or not until the next morning ?
just after .
so you were out past curfew ?
that &apos;s the alternative question .
either alternative is still an admission of guilt .
you ever leave the light on at night ?
sure . i &apos;ve left it on a few times .
sounds like a night @-@ light to me .
but who isn &apos;t afraid of the dark every once in a while , right ?
very nice . thank you .
thanks a lot . thank you . thanks . bye . thank you .
thanks .
i &apos;ve had the same bra for 10 years .
i always wear clean underwear .
i believe you .
hey , thanks for letting me put you on the spot .
it &apos;s no problem , detective .
i didn &apos;t mean to upset you .
you didn &apos;t .
your presentation was really ... cute .
i &apos;ve got it .
so the water bottle that blew up
had traces of glycerin and potassium perma ...
permanganate .
i &apos;m just gonna type that one in .
it &apos;s an oxidizing agent used in water treatment .
the glycerin is sugar alcohol
with uses from food sweetener to antifreeze .
innocent enough apart , but together , highly combustive .
hopefully there &apos;s someone in big yao &apos;s gang
with a connection to those compounds ,
because i haven &apos;t had any luck connecting them with our victim .
so robert hall wasn &apos;t in any of the surveillance photos
from the gang unit ?
nope .
so unless big yao just volunteers
how his dna ended up at the scene ,
frankie and korsak have nothing to sweat him with
when he &apos;s brought in .
wait . that &apos;s big yao ?
selling weed at boylston and tremont three months ago .
so when was this picture taken ?
last friday . i know .
if nothing else , the guys can at least get his diet secrets .
there is no amount of diet or exercise
that will yield results that quickly .
when big yao gets here , have them find out
when and where he did his liposuction .
liposuction ?
how &apos;d it go in interrogation ?
well , it wasn &apos;t easy ,
but eventually , we got a full confession .
about the murder ?
about the lipo .
big yao is a patient of dr. verusca vela .
licensed cosmetic surgeon .
other than proving that big yao
is the most vain gangster in boston ,
what does this have to do with our murder ?
i &apos;m working on a hypothesis about the murder weapon .
glycerin , one of the compounds found in the water bottle ,
is normally purchased commercially .
but if someone didn &apos;t want it traced back to them ,
they could make it on their own
by melting fat ,
like that removed by liposuction .
down to tallow , mixing it with a little lye and salt ,
and voila , you &apos;ve got homemade glycerin .
is that ... from a person ?
cow .
oh . good .
it smells delicious .
well , if you have access , liposuction byproduct
is the easiest way to get enough fat without anybody noticing .
i mean , you wouldn &apos;t believe the looks i got
just for ordering 10 pounds of bovine leaf fat from the butcher .
oh , i believe it .
well , our killer would &apos;ve needed a lot more than i did ,
because my demonstration is just 1 / 10th the size .
demonstration ?
i do need to test my hypothesis .
kent .
ah , yes .
now , pay attention .
on the bottom , we have homemade glycerin .
on the top , we have potassium permanganate .
now , you mix these two puppies together
and bang !
any questions ?
in the middle , this layer of fat is strong enough
to keep them from combining ,
but weak enough to spread apart when shaken .
like during a bike ride .
so you think that someone made the explosive
that killed robert hall with ... lipo fat ?
well , if the experiment proves tenable ,
then it would explain the other dna
and why we didn &apos;t find any trigger mechanism at the scene .
it &apos;s no wonder jane comes down here all the time .
you guys have all the fun .
she &apos;s gonna hate that she missed out on the fat bomb .
well , it &apos;s actually
a lipid @-@ accelerating exothermic combustive device .
no , that &apos;s not as sexy as fat bomb .
well , the office of the chief medical examiner
is not gonna write &quot; fat bomb &quot; as a cause of death .
it &apos;s made of fat . it is a bomb .
what ? you , too .
if the fat bomb fits ...
people , please . can we just let the science speak for itself ?
now , i want you to look into this box ,
look into your hearts ...
and tell me ...
what would you call this ?
sorry , maura . i &apos;m with fat bomb .
finally .
i have two procedures scheduled this afternoon
and i would very much prefer not to miss either one of them .
nobody needs botox that bad .
i don &apos;t add poison to the body .
i free it of excess .
and get pretty creative with it , too , apparently .
can &apos;t even imagine what you &apos;re implying , officer .
it &apos;s sergeant .
and i &apos;m not implying anything , dr. vela .
i already know what you did with david yao &apos;s fat
after the liposuction .
sorry , i don &apos;t know who that is .
maybe you know him as big yao ,
or not @-@ so @-@ big yao , thanks to you .
you need to stop lying .
doctor / patient confidentiality .
my apologies .
how about you explain how fat from big yao
that killed a young man ?
i have before and after pictures ,
since that &apos;s something you &apos;re more familiar with .
a bomb ?
i wouldn &apos;t even know where to start .
then you won &apos;t mind if we check your records ,
see if you purchased any controlled substances
with your medical credentials ?
yeah . i mean , that -- that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not a problem .
the fat goes into decanting cannisters ,
and -- and then i never see it again .
it &apos;s sunland medical waste that removes it from the premises .
but they are supposed to incinerate it right away .
i &apos;ll take that information as well .
fine .
last place no good ?
oh , i &apos;m pretty sure half the units there
are rented out by the hour .
you know , there &apos;s an easier option .
yeah , i know . the internet .
no . maura &apos;s .
ma , you &apos;ve got a great thing going here . why change that ?
do you remember when you were 15
and you asked me to stop cutting your hair ?
kind of .
kind of ?
it was a huge decision for you .
you sat me down like -- like you were gonna move out .
well , we hated giving you adjustments .
you remember the time when i asked you
to stop putting oregano on my pasta ?
hey , i don &apos;t wanna talk about that .
see ?
you wanted to go to the barber
like all the boys in the neighborhood .
you even paid for it yourself . it made you feel like a man .
i get it .
no , i &apos;m gonna make your life easier .
who are you calling ?
no one . we are gonna find you an apartment .
there . see ?
oh . could you make it bigger ?
what ? the apartment ?
no , the -- the screen .
sergeant . come in .
i &apos;m stuck waiting on a subpoena
for sunland medical &apos;s personnel records .
were you able to find anything in dr. vela &apos;s file
that ties her to robert hall &apos;s meth business ?
well , there was no pseudoephedrine
or any other suspicious chemicals in her purchase order .
but ?
but i did notice something else .
so according to her records , dr. vela has performed
enough liposuction surgeries to remove approximately
1,000 pounds of aspirated fat per month .
so that would mean ...
around 300 of these cannisters .
sunland was only billing her to remove 100 of them per month .
she &apos;s fat skimming .
these are strict laws on the disposal of medical waste .
so paying sunland at least something
would make her appear compliant .
and she could get rid of the rest with someone less expensive .
skirting around numerous epa regulations .
so she &apos;s not gonna admit where that fat &apos;s ending up ...
but she might show us .
thanks , doc .
of course it &apos;s the last car on the lot .
dr. vela better not keep us out here all night .
it &apos;s a nice night , though . i mean , look at that moon .
i &apos;ve never seen you be so happy to be on a stakeout .
i just spent the last three hours
using the internet with my mother .
got it . well , welcome back .
korsak .
okay , that &apos;s just gross .
she &apos;s transporting the fat in her trunk ?
well , i wouldn &apos;t want that in my leather seats .
hold on .
maybe she &apos;s not transporting it anywhere .
dumping it &apos;s just as illegal .
boston police .
disposing of medical waste in a civilian dumpster
in the middle of the night ?
on the day we talked to you ?
boy , dumb criminals make this job so easy .
if there &apos;s nothing else , officers ...
hold it .
she &apos;s retrieving it .
knew we &apos;d figure it out .
how long have you been throwing away fat like this ?
maybe a year .
business is really tough .
people are working out and eating healthy .
oh , don &apos;t blame it on kale .
you &apos;ve been cutting corners to save your bottom line .
at least i wasn &apos;t making a bomb .
it &apos;s still illegal . your employees know about this ?
you think i &apos;d be toting fat down here by myself in the dark
if i was okay letting someone else know ?
well , somebody knows .
korsak .
if you &apos;re calling to see the fat bomb ,
first , that &apos;s not the name .
second , we &apos;ve made a lot of progress ...
why do you have case face ?
case face ?
what have you gotten yourself into ?
one of the trainees ...
i embarrassed him , and i think i touched a nerve .
when class was over , he pulled the ,
&quot; hey , i dropped my pen . can you bend over and pick it up ? &quot; gag .
are you sure it wasn &apos;t an accident ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
all right , well , in a class of overachievers ,
it &apos;s not surprising to find at least one power complex .
yeah , and add a genius complex and throw in some gender issues .
i mean , i &apos;ve certainly dealt with worse ,
but none of them carry badges .
i hear you ,
but dropping a pen is hardly grounds
for expulsion from the fbi academy .
plus , the bureau thoroughly vets their recruits .
i mean , what are the chances that this trainee
could slip past them even if he does have some pathology ?
or what if he just never got caught ?
so i did some digging .
check your e @-@ mail .
okay , three years ago , this guy was editor @-@ in @-@ chief
at his school newspaper .
there was a freshman on his staff named penny williams .
she committed suicide .
she won a pacemaker award .
that &apos;s like a nobel prize for journalism .
yeah , becoming a journalist was her dream ,
and i think he ruined it for her .
you don &apos;t think he murdered her ?
no , but i think he played a part in her unraveling
because he was threatened .
there were other freshman there that had
10 to 15 articles published . penny only had two .
for a nationally recognized talent ?
yeah . something &apos;s off .
well , have you mentioned this girl &apos;s suicide
to special agent davies ?
he knew about it .
the fbi did not feel that it was connected to shaun .
but if i &apos;m right about this , i @-@ i can &apos;t just do nothing .
that &apos;s why you have case face .
you &apos;re gonna try and prove a pattern
of misogynistic behavior .
well , if i don &apos;t ,
they &apos;re gonna give this guy federal authority in 12 weeks .
well , you better get started .
you &apos;re only gonna be there for 12 more hours .
yeah .
here &apos;s dr. vela .
this was last week ?
the night after big yao &apos;s latest surgery .
after she leaves , look who shows up .
hello , fat bandit .
can &apos;t see his car or his face .
do you have another angle on this lot ?
it &apos;s the only one on the premises .
but the boston joe &apos;s across the street gave me this .
dr. vela left the building at 11 : 14 .
four minutes later ...
blue subaru outback .
the resolution &apos;s too low to get a plate .
it &apos;s a start .
if that car belongs to hall &apos;s drug partner ,
he &apos;s probably been to his place before .
maybe a neighbor saw it .
i &apos;ll get my keys .
good idea getting the coffee shop footage , holiday .
i remembered frankie brought
a boston joe &apos;s cup home last night .
figured it was worth a shot .
hmm . you guys have a nickname yet ?
goodbye , vince .
ninkie ?
frina ?
holizzoli ?
rizziday .
there it is .
rizziday .
have a nice rizziday .
thank you .
yeah .
thanks for your time .
nothing . you guys ?
there &apos;s one person who saw the car
in front of hall &apos;s apartment but never saw a driver .
i can see if anyone has a front door camera .
it &apos;s worth a shot .
or we could talk to the d.o.t.
worth a shot .
hi . am i interrupting ?
angela . not at all . come on in .
i , uh , i brought lunch .
i made lunch . a @-@ a big lunch .
lovely . should we take it to my office ?
sure .
are we celebrating some big news ?
the apartment hunt ?
frankie . i can &apos;t believe he blabbed about it .
it wasn &apos;t frankie .
the classified section of my newspaper
has been disappearing for the last week .
well , maybe i &apos;m buying a boat .
i was looking at apartments .
but not because you have been anything but delightful to live with .
i feel the same way about you .
sit down .
ah , you know , maura ,
part of my growth as an independent woman this year
has been ... well , learning ...
learning about taking care of myself by myself .
i completely understand .
but , you know , having a roommate hasn &apos;t made me
any less of an independent woman .
yeah , well , you are you .
all right , well , if you &apos;re moving out ,
i suppose i &apos;ll just get another tenant .
do you know anyone looking for a place ?
all right , i know what you &apos;re doing .
okay . can &apos;t you just live in the carriage house
and start paying me rent ?
like any other independent , mature adult tenant would .
and just pretend i &apos;m someone else .
all right .
all right , that makes sense .
oh , good !
last time i moved , i almost misplaced frankie &apos;s baby teeth .
okay .
well , thank you .
um , and i will expect a check for $ 900 on the first of the month .
$ 900 ? maura , it &apos;s a studio .
it &apos;s beacon hill .
then i get kitchen privileges in the main house .
fine , but i &apos;ll have to run a full credit check .
you wouldn &apos;t .
and i &apos;ll need three references .
what ? ! three references ?
i have three references for you --
burrata ,
risotto ,
and cannoli .
bam ! there &apos;s my three references .
application accepted .
never thought i &apos;d say this ,
but thank god for street sweeping .
department of transportation ticketed a blue outback
on the victim &apos;s street last month .
owner &apos;s name is leah moore .
and get this -- she &apos;s a chemist .
so she &apos;d know how to cook meth .
and make bombs .
she worked at a lab testing company
in the same building as dr. vela .
so she could &apos;ve known about the illegal fat dump .
why didn &apos;t she show up in the personnel records ?
because leah moore was fired a year ago
after failing a drug test .
soon after , she was arrested for possession
and ordered to attend narcotics anonymous
at the same time robert hall &apos;s parents told us he was in rehab .
so maybe they decided to turn that drug habit
into a drug business .
until hall decided he didn &apos;t need her expertise anymore .
and leah decided she didn &apos;t need him .
boom . fat bomb .
better get a team together and get out there .
hey there .
i &apos;m gonna give you a chance to apologize for yesterday .
the pen dropping thing .
it &apos;s called gravity .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
gravity caused you to wink at me ?
do you think you &apos;re the first man that tried to intimidate me ?
penny williams , i am not .
who ?
you remember her .
she was the girl that drove you nuts
because she wrote circles around you .
penny williams . now i remember .
yeah .
suicide , right ?
tragic .
not for you , though , huh ?
god , that must &apos;ve sucked having a girl be better than you .
just easier to get rid of her , huh ?
you think i murdered her ?
who do you think you are ,
coming here and making an accusation like that ?
you seem awfully defensive .
that &apos;s because penny was a smug little brat
who would &apos;ve gotten more articles published
if she &apos;d bent over and picked up my pen on occasion .
but i didn &apos;t kill her .
i know .
did you get all that , agent davies ?
see , you accuse someone of a crime they didn &apos;t commit ,
they often confess to one they did .
should &apos;ve paid more attention in class .
i didn &apos;t break any laws .
no , being a misogynistic ass is not illegal .
but it is against the fbi &apos;s code of conduct .
you &apos;re through here , mr. graham .
you stupid bitch !
that &apos;s enough .
nice work , rizzoli .
thank you .
we make a good team .
team ?
who gave you the microphone ?
what ...
okay , yeah . i needed the audio / vis-- whatever .
after all this , i feel like i owe you a drink .
oh , uh , uh , my flight leaves in an hour , so ...
so what if it left in two ?
i am the fbi .
the victim &apos;s meth lab was brand @-@ new ,
so there &apos;s a good chance that this suspect &apos;s house
is another cook site .
i &apos;ve asked dr. isles along to help identify other dangers .
meth chemicals themselves are just as explosive as a bomb .
she &apos;ll be another set of eyes inside .
all right , let &apos;s move .
korsak , she &apos;s here .
stop .
the cannister on the right is red phosphorous .
one spark , and the whole room will be filled with toxic gas .
hey , frankie . bet some of big yao &apos;s in there .
stop !
it &apos;s leah moore .
where ?
outside . she &apos;s running away .
shit .
she &apos;s running behind the houses .
stop !
put it down , leah .
only 5 % of pursuit suspects escape .
i &apos;ll take those odds . back off !
nice , maura . nice . i got it .
touche , dr. isles .
you okay ?
yeah .
so you stabbed her ?
i didn &apos;t stab her .
frankie said you stabbed her .
it was just a parry . but it was highly effective .
sometimes the best offense is a good defense .
can i open my present now ?
and who am i to deny the first person in 5,000 years
to use fencing in combat ?
it hasn &apos;t nearly been that long .
you know , in the revolutionary war ,
sabres accounted for 1 / 3 of the battle --
oh , my god . please open it .
okay .
you didn &apos;t have to .
thank you for making me go .
you happy you went after all ?
i am . i really am .
i @-@ i was really happy to be in that classroom .
and i was just so proud of the trainees , you know ?
and they just really made me hopeful for the future .
oh , good .
you didn &apos;t get this from quantico , did you ?
yes , i did .
oh , come on !
really ? !
i @-@ i was in the airport , and i was running late .
but clearly , i didn &apos;t look at it .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s the thought that counts .
i -- no , you know what ?
this is exactly the kind of joke that that jerk trainee
would love -- give it to me . i &apos;m throwing it away .
no . no , no . no , i hate that . i @-@ i &apos;ll keep it . i &apos;ll just --
i &apos;ll wear it underneath my fencing uniform .
you can &apos;t wear that .
sure i can . i &apos;ll just change the lettering .
to what ?
female ...
tube inspector ?
what is that ? what &apos;s -- what &apos;s a female tube inspector ?
you know , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t wanna know .
just -- i &apos;ll throw it away .
okay , you know what ? i think , actually , this color ,
it looks a lot better on you , so you can keep it .
i don &apos;t want it . it has the word &quot; boob &quot; on it .
