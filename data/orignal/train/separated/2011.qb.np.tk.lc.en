you lose , we don &apos;t merge .
you win , you get what you want .
you lose , you stay .
you extend your noncompete ,
and you get a chance
to earn your name on the door
because it &apos;s not going up there now .
there &apos;s no room for both of us .
unless we made room for each other .
i put him on the list , and i handed it in .
he didn &apos;t put you on his list .
i won &apos;t .
you will .
harvey will never forgive me .
this is a letter to the district attorney ,
saying that you are breaking the law .
you file your motion ...
i &apos;ll file mine .
you weren &apos;t there .
i didn &apos;t have to be .
jessica--
you don &apos;t work for jessica . you work for me .
you &apos;re fired .
no , he &apos;s not .
you could &apos;ve just told me that you didn &apos;t love me
instead of selling me out .
i didn &apos;t sell you out , scottie .
i just got fired .
whatever she did ,
you wouldn &apos;t have this merger without her .
would you have her work here or in london ?
you &apos;re going to stay here ,
be humble ,
and learn your goddamn place .
i never went to harvard .
what ?
i &apos;m a fraud .
i got your message . what &apos;s going on ?
partners meeting . essential personnel only .
in the middle of the night ?
you afraid of the dark ?
i wouldn &apos;t be if i had my cookie monster with me .
well , then go get him ,
because we &apos;re finalizing the terms of the merger .
we ?
we .
so i &apos;m a partner now ?
easy , marcia clark .
jessica and i discussed it .
you &apos;re responsible for making this merger happen .
you deserve to be here .
so jessica and you talked ?
you forgave her ?
she won . i lost .
nothing to forgive .
and me ?
you did what you had to do .
you have no idea how much i needed to hear that .
the merger is complete .
and we would like to show everyone
that the new darby pearson will be stronger ,
better connected--
and most importantly , based on a foundation that is--
full of shit .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
i told her .
told her what ?
that mike ross is a fraud ,
and i am not going to let him get away with it .
how could you do this ?
you did this to yourself .
how long are you going to keep staring at that offer ?
until one of us blinks .
deron signed it . you said it was great .
i &apos;m not interested in great .
i want it to know who its daddy is .
what is it , donna ?
it &apos;s sunday night . darby needs an answer .
london . send her to london .
do you want to talk about it ?
have ray meet me downstairs .
and where should i say you &apos;re going ?
brooklyn .
i did not expect the great harvey specter
to come all the way to brooklyn
just to deliver a contract .
that &apos;s good , &apos; cause i came for the hot dogs .
i told you , that was our final offer .
you did , but the third quarter &apos;s about to end ,
and if you want deron williams
playing for you in the fourth ,
this is his number .
even if you had another offer ,
which you don &apos;t ,
he can &apos;t leave in the middle of a game .
i was talking about the fourth quarter of game seven ,
when you &apos;re looking to lock up a championship ,
because the question isn &apos;t &quot; do you want deron or not ? &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; do you want a ring or not ? &quot;
you got nothing .
and i told you , that &apos;s my final offer .
then i guess i &apos;ll just have to go bring deron
his new mavs jersey then .
there &apos;s no way mark cuban pays that much .
why don &apos;t you call him and ask ?
oh , wait , you can &apos;t , because he hates you .
bullshit .
we may not be blood brothers ,
but he doesn &apos;t hate me .
oh , he does now .
evidently , he found out about that thing from last may .
how do you know that ?
because i was there when i told him .
you have until 10 : 00 a.m.
then i &apos;m calling dallas .
and mark may not take your call ,
but he &apos;ll sure as hell take mine .
how do i know you &apos;re not going to turn around
and get him to pay more ?
you don &apos;t .
but if you don &apos;t match this ,
you &apos;ll never find out .
jessica .
harvey .
i don &apos;t recall giving you my key .
i don &apos;t recall authorizing you to negotiate
behind deron williams &apos; back .
his back is just fine .
i &apos;m standing right behind it .
then why is the contract he signed in my hand ?
how much did you ask for ?
triple .
you out of your mind ?
we have leverage .
and what is that ?
it &apos;s complicated .
simplify it for me .
i bluffed him .
that &apos;s not leverage .
it is if he believes it .
and if it fails , he fires us
and takes ten other players with him .
then it better not fail .
you asked the man for triple .
if i had what i said i had , that &apos;s what i &apos;d get .
i don &apos;t ask for triple , he knows i &apos;m bluffing .
then don &apos;t bluff in the first place .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s what i do .
you know what i think ?
i think you want it to fail .
i think you &apos;re stuck with a merger you don &apos;t want
and a noncompete you can &apos;t stand ,
and you &apos;re trying to get me to fire you .
i could bust that noncompete wide open .
but you gave me your word .
which is why i &apos;m staying .
jessica , i &apos;ve always operated this way .
it &apos;s what you hired me for ,
it &apos;s what you pay me for ,
and it used to be what you valued me for .
i &apos;m not going to fire you .
neither is deron williams .
nets just caved .
so unless you &apos;re looking to cook me breakfast tomorrow ,
i &apos;d say we &apos;re done .
i told you i needed time .
i know , but it &apos;s been two days ,
and i can &apos;t take it anymore .
i had to see you .
i don &apos;t want any comments about how messy the place is .
okay .
and what would clean look like ?
don &apos;t even think about it .
i can &apos;t not think about it , all right ?
it &apos;s all i &apos;ve been able to think about for two days .
mike , why are you here ?
because that &apos;s not going to happen .
now or ever ?
you lied to me about everything .
rachel .
do you remember when i told you i needed time ?
that &apos;s what i needed it for .
to process this bomb that you dropped on me .
i had a nightmare .
you asked why i &apos;m here . that &apos;s why .
i--
you exposed me to the entire firm .
i would never do that .
i know .
and i woke up , and i realized
that the real nightmare wouldn &apos;t even be that .
the real nightmare would be--
would be if you didn &apos;t want to be with me .
do you really mean that ?
i meant it the first time i ever saw you .
rachel ,
i know that i &apos;m not who you want me to be ,
but--but you know what happened in that room .
you know what we both felt .
i--
i don &apos;t want to lose that .
i just keep wishing you never told me .
but then it never would have happened .
and it did .
and i &apos;m--
i &apos;m really glad that it did .
i am , too .
but what happens if you get caught ?
because what you had may have been a nightmare , mike ,
but you can &apos;t tell me you &apos;re not afraid of being exposed .
of course i am .
but there &apos;s nothing that i can do about it .
well , maybe there is .
what are you saying ?
quit .
go in tomorrow , and just quit .
第三季 第一集
i need to talk to you .
you want to talk about how things played out ,
but the place to do that is somewhere more private .
you didn &apos;t just come through on the merger .
you bluffed hardman ,
turned monica eton ,
and put us over the top on folsom foods .
now that &apos;s a lot of coming through in the clutch .
and i wouldn &apos;t have saved your ass
if i didn &apos;t think you deserved to be here .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
well , the usual response is &quot; thank you . &quot;
the usual road to getting here
doesn &apos;t involve stabbing someone in the back .
doesn &apos;t it ?
when i was 16,
i came home , my mother sat me down ,
and said my parents were separating .
trial basis .
but the good news was she was going to get me a car
to help with my sister .
all my friends talked about how lucky i was to have it .
i hated that car .
every time i got in it , i--
it just reminded me .
why are you telling me this ?
because five years later ,
that same car got me to harvard ,
which led me here .
so you can think of this office
as a reminder of what you did to harvey
or as a symbol of what you can accomplish at the firm .
now , do you still have something to say ?
no .
no , i don &apos;t .
they ever get back together ?
no .
no , they didn &apos;t .
ah , god ! damn it !
louis , what happened ?
oh . i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
this stupid merger .
it &apos;s bad enough my vote is worth
1 / 3 of what it was last week .
now our uni @-@ balls , gone .
our ... what ?
pens , donna .
the new quartermaster ,
barbara l. tottingham ,
will not buy us any more uni @-@ balls .
there &apos;s not one single uni @-@ ball in this entire firm .
please stop saying uni @-@ ball .
no , i will not .
stuck with these stupid plastic things
that keep breaking .
so buy your own pen .
bu--
okay .
there are two things in this firm
that i hold very sacred-- my uni @-@ balls
and my raspberry bran bars .
and if i have to go and buy &apos; em myself ,
well , then , this barbara l. tottingham
has a message for me , loud and clear ,
and that &apos;s &quot; louis litt , go screw yourself . &quot;
louis , the ink on your face . you &apos;ve got just , like--
you &apos;ve got , like , a little bit right there .
where , here ?
no , i think you &apos;ve gotta give it , like , a good--
okay , fine .
gone ?
thank you , donna . you &apos;re a true friend .
i got your back .
hey , do you remember
when you used to do those rotator cuff exercises ?
oh , yeah , what are you kidding ? of course .
every day for , like , 18 months .
why do you ask ?
no reason .
高级合伙人
edward .
jessica , how lovely to see you .
i wanted to thank you .
ah . you saw the sign .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
our agreement stipulates darby pearson ,
not pearson darby .
our agreement also stipulates a 51 / 49 percentage structure .
and this is your way of showing me
that you think of it as 50 / 50 .
merely a gesture .
ah .
heck of a gesture .
how would you propose to a woman ?
a woman ?
i think we both know that--
yes , we do .
anyway ...
it is shaping up to be a lovely day .
oh , i wish i could say that same .
i assume you know about the latest goings @-@ on with hessington oil .
i wouldn &apos;t be much of a partner if i didn &apos;t .
now they &apos;ve decide to take on ava hessington personally .
who is they ?
the u.s. government .
i &apos;ve decided to let harvey handle it .
why ?
why not ?
it &apos;s not a good time .
he &apos;s still digesting the merger .
meaning ?
he &apos;s acting out .
well , he may be acting out ,
but i understand
he just got his client triple the money .
by taking a huge risk he didn &apos;t have to .
this case , he may have to .
so that &apos;s why harvey .
and this case is more important to me than just money .
and why is that ?
because it is .
what if i said no ?
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not an option .
so i guess that sign
really doesn &apos;t mean 50 / 50 after all .
i did say it was merely a gesture .
you keep showing up to surprise me ,
people are gonna get the wrong idea .
people are going to think what they &apos;re going to think .
i &apos;m here to bury the hatchet .
and what prompted that ?
darby found out what you did with deron williams .
don &apos;t tell me . he was impressed .
he was pissed .
thinks you &apos;re trying to get fired .
and you told him how smart he was .
i told him you said it wasn &apos;t true
and that i believed you ,
and then i fought to give you a chance to prove it .
ava hessington .
i got you on it .
what does that matter to me ?
harvey ,
i know you and i have had our problems ,
but this is a chance for us to move past it .
let &apos;s take it .
you really do wanna make up .
i never wanted to be at odds in the first place .
neither did i.
are we good ?
don &apos;t you wanna tell me i better win this goddamn case ?
i didn &apos;t think i had to .
never stopped you from saying it before .
well , i &apos;m learning to let go .
oh , harvey , there is one more thing .
you better win this goddamn case .
助理
i know it &apos;s not my place ,
but you really suck at quitting .
i can explain .
no need . it was just a suggestion .
rachel , i tried to do it , but--
but then jessica gave you this office to stay ?
actually , she gave me this office
before i could even bring it up .
well , aren &apos;t you just the luckiest person in the world ?
rachel--
you came to me , you were petrified of being exposed ,
and i gave you a way out .
and now , 12 hours later , you &apos;re in a brand @-@ new office
with a diploma on the wall that , for all i know ,
came from kinko &apos;s .
what do you want me to do ? everyone hangs one .
no , mike , everyone doesn &apos;t just hang one .
so that &apos;s what this is really about .
you &apos;re damn right it is .
i &apos;ve been trying to earn one for as long as i can remember .
and you have one and everything that goes with it ,
and you didn &apos;t do a single thing to deserve it .
you have no idea what i have or haven &apos;t done
to get where i am .
and that &apos;s the whole problem .
i have no idea who you are .
harvey , i &apos;m just in the middle of a little afternoon crossword .
are you a puzzler ?
don &apos;t you have work to do ?
my dear fellow , if i have to do work ,
then i &apos;m not doing my job .
what can i do for you ?
jessica told me
that you agreed to let me be lead on ava hessington .
i wanted to thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
there &apos;s just one problem .
you didn &apos;t agree to anything . you demanded it .
and you let jessica play good cop
because you didn &apos;t wanna undermine the chain of command .
that &apos;s quite the conspiracy theory .
well , here &apos;s the good news .
my plate &apos;s a little full right now .
and since you didn &apos;t want me on this case in the first place ,
why don &apos;t you let somebody else handle it ?
good luck . i hear it &apos;s a tough one .
what do you want ?
i want out .
i win this ,
you tear up my noncompete , and you fire me .
you hate this merger that much .
i had an agreement with jessica ,
and i honored it .
then she accused me of trying to get fired .
then she lied to me
by claiming that she fought for me
to be on this case .
she really does wanna make up with you , you know .
funny way of showing it .
ironic .
her belief that you wanted to be fired
led you to wanting to be fired .
do we have a deal or not ?
it appears we do .
oh , hey . uh , go ahead .
no , that &apos;s all right . you were here first .
why are you being so polite ?
come on , you have one stupid copy .
you could &apos;ve finished it already .
i &apos;m doing it for you .
louis , i--
why ?
it &apos;s complicated .
well , simplify it for me , mike .
harvey .
he &apos;s the one who hired me .
now he wants nothing to do with me .
what are you talking about ? he just gave you a new office .
no , jessica gave me a new office .
if it was up to harvey , i wouldn &apos;t even have a cubicle .
what happened ?
all that matters is that , uh , i can &apos;t fix it .
you know , when we were in the bullpen ,
harvey was like superman .
and then , one day ,
hardman decided to just knock him down a peg .
gave him this bullshit assignment ,
undoable workload , unwinnable case .
and i took it as a chance
to break down his walls and offer my help .
and i just thought , this just might be
the chance that we could become--
friends .
yeah .
and he looked at me-- how dare i ?
i get it . he &apos;s alone .
he always has been . he always will be .
always was .
harvey is not superman anymore .
he &apos;s batman .
and batman needs robin .
and i just need to remind him of that .
what &apos;s the one thing that harvey values over everything else ?
winning .
yeah .
you help him win ,
he &apos;ll remember why he needs you .
i have to figure out what cases he &apos;s working on .
the i.t. department has access to every computer
in the entire firm , syncs up every night .
so all i have to do is get access to harvey &apos;s hard drive .
that place is a fortress .
benjamin .
benjamin .
it &apos;s you .
aw , that &apos;s sweet . you remember me .
oh , yes .
i remember everyone who &apos;s ever bamboozled me
into giving them a top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line laptop .
their names are michael ross .
i didn &apos;t bamboozle you , benjamin .
i won it fair and square .
and i &apos;ve been tracking every internet move you &apos;ve made
for the past ten months , waiting for the slipup .
bet you thought you had me at teenybikini.com.
no . no , no .
because i cross @-@ referenced that
with your workplace harassment case , and i knew .
but don &apos;t think i &apos;m not aware that you went home for dinner
and used your personal computer to go back there .
okay , that &apos;s not actionable ,
but hacking my personal computer is .
good luck proving that . now , what do you want ?
i want access to a hard drive .
no way .
not only that , i want you to give me
whatever i want whenever i want it
for the rest of your life .
and why would i do that ?
oh , right .
because i just recorded you admitting to violating the law .
the xjs @-@ 5000 .
you--you set me up .
yep .
you knew that i would track your home computer .
and after you &apos;ve been convicted ,
you &apos;ll be lucky to be hired as a network administrator ...
at a high school ...
in jersey .
how long are you gonna keep at this ?
until i find out what i just got myself into .
i mean , look at this stack of papers .
it &apos;s 1 / 5 of the files we have on ava hessington .
you need a shortcut .
well , i &apos;m not going to mike .
i &apos;m not talking about him .
ava hessington started in the london office .
it &apos;s too late .
no , it &apos;s not .
you gotta be kidding me .
how did you get through security ?
charm and this smile .
you bought a ticket , didn &apos;t you ?
trinidad @-@ tobago .
first @-@ class ? you &apos;re not even going .
i prefer to not travel in style .
i &apos;d prefer to be alone right now .
scottie , i need your help .
i &apos;m sorry , i have a plane to catch .
a plane , by the way , that you put me on .
after i saved your job , which you accepted .
so now we &apos;re both working for the same firm .
oh , i guess now i &apos;m just one of the many partners
who gets to work with you
and yet wants nothing to do with you .
scottie .
please !
you once helped me without me asking .
well , now i &apos;m asking .
then tell me something .
something what ?
just ...
something .
i remember the first time i ever saw you .
con law .
you threw me some line , and i gave you shit about your hair .
no , it was two weeks before that
outside langdell .
you were wearing a blue dress . the wind was blowing .
when i saw your face , it stopped me dead in my tracks .
that &apos;s not enough .
well , i &apos;m not finished .
the next time i saw you was con law .
you answered the first question that dyson asked ,
and i knew that that face that blew me away
was your second best asset .
look , you mean something to me .
you &apos;ve always meant something to me ,
and you always will mean something to me .
you are such a dick .
what do you need , harvey ?
ava hessington .
well , this is gonna take a while .
so you &apos;re gonna buy me a drink ,
and i &apos;m gonna take that ticket to trinidad @-@ tobago .
okay norma , it &apos;s been 24 hours .
if you can &apos;t get me barbara l. tottingham on the phone ,
well , then guess what , you don &apos;t get--
oh . it &apos;s you !
well , you tell norma if i don &apos;t have a package of uni @-@ balls
on my desk by noon ,
she can kiss her trip to dollywood good @-@ bye .
now , why don &apos;t you get the hell out of here ,
so i can fix myself a raspberry bran bar in peace ?
what are you looking at ?
looking for this ?
it &apos;s the last one .
not today .
you &apos;re barbara l. tottingham .
i hardly made it difficult to figure out .
barbara l. tottingham .
b.l.t. , which is a sandwich .
and what does one put on a b.l.t. ?
mayonnaise , invented by the french .
which points directly to another french sandwich .
of course , the monte cristo , as in the count of monte cristo .
how did i not see that ?
it was staring me right in the face .
indeed it was .
the count returned from the dead ,
as i am now returned
from the banishment to which you sentenced me ...
as quartermaster .
i would ask you how you did it ,
but i know you wouldn &apos;t tell me , because i wouldn &apos;t tell you .
what i will tell you is
that during my time in the wilderness--
it was three days .
and nights .
i endeavored to discover
what perquisites you value most in this firm--
your beloved bran bars .
you &apos;re never going to have them .
i can buy them myself .
even if you were willing to buy them yourself--
which we both know you aren &apos;t--
you &apos;ll never eat them on pearson darby grounds .
you didn &apos;t .
i did . they &apos;re banned .
wait a second .
you &apos;re telling me that barbara l. tottingham is nigel ?
no . stay with me .
b.l.t. , mayonnaise , monte cristo sandwich .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so hungry .
donna .
what ?
what do you want from me , louis ? i &apos;m busy .
so you can &apos;t have your pens or your bran bars , big deal .
donna , listen .
when i was in ninth grade ,
there was this wrestler randy cusumano .
and one day after school in the locker room ,
he pinned me down , and he taped my butt cheeks together .
wait a second , is this the story from the breakfast club ?
i &apos;m not familiar with that song .
never mind .
look , i swore that i would get him back
no matter what it took .
what did it take ?
ah , you don &apos;t really wanna know .
thank you .
the point is if i &apos;m nigel and nigel &apos;s me ,
he &apos;s not gonna stop at bran bars and pens .
i gotta take care of nigel once and for all .
you need to get rid of him as quartermaster .
miss hessington ,
first of all , i want you to familiarize yourself
with this man .
u.s. attorney richard jensen .
he &apos;s one of the best there is ,
and he &apos;s who we &apos;ll be going up against .
well , that &apos;s all well and good , mr. specter ,
but i have one question .
why should i hire you ?
because you trust edward darby .
i &apos;m afraid that only gets you in the room .
this civil servant
seems to have a personal vendetta against me ,
and i don &apos;t even know why .
well , i do .
he needs a head on a platter .
why mine ?
you &apos;ve been skirting environmental laws for a decade .
he &apos;s got a chance to nail you , and he &apos;s gonna take it .
this isn &apos;t an environmental allegation .
no , it &apos;s a bribery charge ,
it &apos;s got teeth , and it &apos;s coming your way .
don &apos;t sugarcoat it , mr. specter .
give it to me straight .
okay , i will .
because when he digs a little deeper ,
he &apos;s gonna find evidence
of the spill your company covered up in 2008,
the whistle @-@ blower you bought off in 2010,
and the environmental impact study you doctored in 2006 .
so it &apos;s not gonna be hard to convince a jury
that you &apos;re guilty of bribing a foreign government
to get your pipeline .
and what are you going to do to stop him ?
bury evidence , contact witnesses ,
or sleep with your rival pitcher &apos;s girlfriend
the night before the big game ?
the heart wants what the heart wants .
i got it .
i looked into you . you looked into me .
i actually prefer it that way .
and why is that ?
because you know what i &apos;ll do to win .
saves me the trouble of explaining it to you .
and i won &apos;t have to explain to you
what i did to win that pipeline .
you bribed them .
guilty as charged .
and i don &apos;t care what richard jensen says .
every company with a pipeline over there
did the same thing .
is that your defense ?
it &apos;s the truth .
it would be nice if we only found oil
under texas ranchers or north sea fishermen .
but in the real world ,
we find it in nasty places under nasty people .
and any executive worth a damn does what &apos;s needed
or goes out of business .
good . we &apos;re done .
excuse me ?
i just needed to know what i was dealing with
before i make my next move .
and what is that ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
i haven &apos;t officially hired you yet .
yes , you have .
how long you been waiting here ?
since i found out what you need .
what i need is for you to leave me alone .
no , what you need is information on ava hessington .
look . in 2008 , her company tried to destroy evidence--
of an oil spill ?
okay , well , in 2010 , they--
they bought off a whistle @-@ blower .
and if the next thing you &apos;re gonna tell me
is about an environmental impact study in 2006,
don &apos;t .
you think you &apos;re not replaceable ?
i got all that from an associate
i picked at random .
i &apos;ve been doing this before i met you ,
and i &apos;ll be doing it long after
i &apos;ve forgotten all about you .
you had enough ?
no .
no , you know what , i haven &apos;t , because you haven &apos;t .
excuse me ?
you haven &apos;t said whatever you have to say to rip me
to shreds enough so that you can start to forgive me .
so go ahead .
whatever it takes , i can take it .
go !
harvey , i &apos;m sorry , all right ?
but i need you to listen to me now .
listen to you ?
you know when i would &apos;ve listened to you ?
that night .
jessica threatened me .
i don &apos;t care .
anyone comes at you with any threat at all ,
you come to me .
i don &apos;t give a shit if it &apos;s the queen of england .
you come to me . you tell me !
you tell me everything !
that &apos;s what goddamn loyalty is .
okay , you &apos;re right .
you don &apos;t know who i am
or what i &apos;ve done to deserve anything .
so here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen . i am gonna tell you .
i am gonna tell you everything ,
and when we &apos;re done , either we &apos;re gonna be finished ,
or we &apos;re gonna go back there and
we &apos;re gonna do exactly what we should &apos;ve done the other night .
okay .
okay . one more time .
i &apos;m gonna show you .
are you ready ?
yes .
you sure ?
okay .
so i was here .
yeah ? and i was running down here .
and the cops , they were back here .
so i am running-- let &apos;s see , where is it ?
oh , yeah , it was down here .
and i run into here ,
and then donna , she was right here .
okay .
so she let me in ...
here .
and then harvey , he was right down--
no !
what ?
harvey is not getting anywhere near there .
oh , no one is ever getting anywhere near there .
oh , you think you &apos;re that good , do you ?
it &apos;s one of my many gifts .
being that good or thinking you &apos;re that good ?
do you want a replay ? &apos; cause i will go right now .
like you could .
i could !
soon ... ish .
do you have , like , an energy drink or something ?
come on ! we were up all night .
you kept me up all night .
you kept me up all night .
i can &apos;t tell you how it feels
that you know .
mm , well , who knew
that honesty was the best policy ?
oh , wait . everyone knew that .
what ?
can i help you ?
louis litt .
oh , i know who you are .
freshly minted senior partner ,
expert in matters of corporate finance ,
and the man responsible for the superb training
of the associates .
you &apos;ve looked into me .
i &apos;ve looked into you .
tarte au chocolat from cafe pouchkine .
the best patisserie in paris .
a steeping cup of da hong pao .
the most expensive tea in the world .
two of my favorite things .
what better to enjoy after signing this order ...
making me quartermaster ?
pity you don &apos;t have a montblanc pen
for me to sign it with .
with cobalt ink .
we already have a quartermaster .
sir , i know ...
that this is nigel &apos;s position
and him losing it would not be easy for him .
but let me just assure you ,
i &apos;m not just prepared for this position ...
i was born for it .
i have phds in chemical engineering
and petroleum exploration .
i &apos;ve made it to the top in a field
dominated by men ,
and i &apos;m facing a prison sentence
for an allegation which any man
in my position would be fined for .
every similar case has been settled with a fine ,
not prison .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re proposing .
well , there &apos;s just one problem .
i &apos;m not charging you because you &apos;re a woman .
i &apos;m charging you because you &apos;re the one i caught .
ava , can you give us a minute ?
okay , she &apos;s gonna write you a check .
let &apos;s talk about how much .
i &apos;m sorry , harvey .
not this time .
is that what i said to you on hazelton ?
that was a long time ago .
we &apos;re not at the d.a. &apos; s office anymore .
i didn &apos;t realize our bond had an expiration date .
it doesn &apos;t , but ...
you want to deal on this , i need jail time .
you &apos;re running for office ?
what if i am ?
you need a scalp .
i can think of four people off the top of my head
that make her look like mother teresa .
harvey , i can &apos;t afford to horse trade on this .
you &apos;ve done it before .
and i &apos;ll do it again , but ... not today .
richard , you are singling out this woman , and it &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s not my problem .
what if i told you i need this one ?
then i &apos;d have to tell you ... i &apos;m sorry .
not gonna forget this .
harvey , look .
if our bond can &apos;t survive me telling you no , then ...
it didn &apos;t mean much to begin with .
hey , rach .
no time , code two !
richard gere &apos;s in the lobby ?
leaving now , let &apos;s go .
relax .
we have trained for this .
okay .
wait !
congratulations .
your writing implements and nourishment of choice .
yeah , i &apos;d say i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m not .
please don &apos;t do this .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
you &apos;re not gonna trick me into letting you stay quartermaster
just so you can take away what &apos;s most dear to me
little by little .
then i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to take it away all at once .
what are you talking about ?
i took you for a bylaws man . it seems i was wrong .
at darby international ,
one cannot be in charge of both the animate
and the inanimate at the same time .
your beloved associates are mine .
you set me up .
what better way to catch a rat
than with quartermaster cheese ?
what are you gonna do ,
beg darby to undo what you just begged him to do ?
hold on .
nigel , the associates are my life .
so please don &apos;t do this .
when i was at preparatory school ,
like you , i was bullied again and again .
it was painful , but i always saw them coming .
but with you , i didn &apos;t .
so it wasn &apos;t a stab in the back , it was a stab in the heart .
and i just gave you the opportunity to take it back ,
and you passed .
so no , quartermaster litt ,
i won &apos;t forgive you .
nice office .
thanks .
do you mind if i ask you a favor ?
yeah , anything .
i have a ton of old files
that i need organized and shipped to storage ,
and i was wondering if you could maybe do that for me .
i--
because i figured
if you were suddenly doing things for people
that they don &apos;t need you to do , didn &apos;t ask you to do ,
and don &apos;t want you to do , then maybe i &apos;d get in on that .
i put that on harvey &apos;s desk for him , not you .
maybe .
but i know what you don &apos;t seem to get .
harvey didn &apos;t value you for your help on cases .
he valued you for your loyalty , which he told you last night .
yeah , i know that .
and i &apos;m trying to get it back ,
and this is the only way i know how .
by sending rachel to distract me and sneaking into his office ?
oh , by the way , you think i don &apos;t know about you two ?
took me one look .
donna , come on .
you wanna know how to get harvey &apos;s loyalty back ?
get in a time machine and undo what you did with jessica .
oh , shoot , you can &apos;t do that .
you know what , i figured you &apos;d bring this file back .
there &apos;s also one in your bottom drawer .
you might wanna grab that too .
and just in case of that ,
i put seven other copies in his office .
&apos;cause whether he forgives me or not ,
he &apos;s still gonna need it .
some random associate
gave him all that information on ava hessington ?
no way .
it was scottie .
yeah , i found
the ticket to trinidad @-@ tobago .
it &apos;s not a giant leap .
the only problem is scottie &apos;s not here .
she &apos;s in london .
and harvey-- he is still gonna need this .
this file doesn &apos;t lead to harvey forgiving you .
donna ...
please could you just separate our relationship
from yours and his for just , like , one second ?
are you kidding me ?
do you think i &apos;m mad just because of him ?
you did this to me too .
and whether you appreciate it or not ,
i &apos;ve had your back since the day that you got here .
yes . yes , you have . but what about last year ?
when i had your back , you ignored me ,
and it almost cost him his license .
the difference is i did what i did for him ,
not for me .
and i didn &apos;t get a brand @-@ new office for it .
i got fired .
yum .
oh , what do you want , michael ? please .
i &apos;m just trying to eat my egg mcmuffin
while i &apos;m still off @-@ line , okay ?
i thought you were never off @-@ line .
five minutes a day .
listen , benjamin ,
i don &apos;t wanna hold what &apos;s on this dictaphone over you
for the rest of your life .
why not ?
i don &apos;t need any more enemies .
i &apos;d rather have a friend , but ...
i do need a favor .
and if i don &apos;t give it to you ,
then what do you do with the dictaphone ?
it &apos;s the only copy there is .
go on , erase it .
then i &apos;ll ask you my favor .
how do i know that this is the only copy ?
because i &apos;m giving you my word .
what do you need ?
i need you to build me a time machine .
and a bite of the sandwich .
come on . that &apos;s not sanitary , michael .
come on , just a little .
you can have the rest .
how did it go with richard ?
it didn &apos;t .
he didn &apos;t budge .
why not ?
says he &apos;s running for office , but it doesn &apos;t make sense .
yeah , it does .
son of bitch !
he looks me in the eye ,
and he feeds me a bullshit sandwich .
he &apos;s obviously not the same man he used to be .
yeah , well , i am .
wait a second . let me guess . mike ?
just because you use it doesn &apos;t mean you have to forgive him .
you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t .
harvey . what are you doing here ?
hessington oil &apos;s number one competitor
also happens to be your biggest campaign contributor ?
which has nothing to do with the fact
that your client broke the law .
you don &apos;t want a deal .
what you want is a long , drawn @-@ out trial
that puts our stock in the toilet .
you think i wasn &apos;t gonna find that out ?
i mean , i gotta hand it to you .
you set it up perfectly to shield yourself from prosecution .
to shield myself from breaking the law .
richard jensen : prosecuting the competition .
it &apos;s a hell of a campaign slogan .
harvey , your client did this .
i &apos;m not going after an innocent person .
and you know that if i win this election ,
i will do good things .
you know what , you sound just like cameron dennis .
you remember ?
always a reason , always out for the greater good .
but in the end , it &apos;s all about him .
look , i &apos;ve never claimed to be out for the greater good .
so cut me a deal and find yourself another donor .
harvey , it &apos;s too late .
please . i need this .
well , that &apos;s not my problem .
send carolyn my love .
you wanted to see me ?
i know why you care so much about ava hessington .
well , it &apos;s no secret .
her father was my first client .
i think he was a little bit more than that .
it was a different time .
does she know ?
she knows that i care about her .
i &apos;m sorry , was there something else you wanted ?
just to let you know that if i could figure that out ,
harvey can figure that out .
and why would that be a problem ?
because it &apos;s one thing for harvey to know
that this case is important to you ,
another to know how important .
are you telling me you don &apos;t trust him ?
i told you
he &apos;s having a difficult time digesting this merger .
i don &apos;t want him using this as leverage to leave .
at the end of the day ,
i don &apos;t believe harvey really wants to leave .
harvey ...
what a coincidence .
cameron . you grew the mustache back .
i &apos;ll let you in on a little secret .
it wasn &apos;t a success the first time .
what are you doing here ?
ah , richard told me that you mentioned me
at your last meeting .
it &apos;s funny , &apos; cause he called me
after your first meeting , wanted my advice .
so i guess you &apos;re here to tell me
he &apos;s not gonna give me a deal .
i &apos;m here to tell you he &apos;s recusing himself from the case .
he didn &apos;t want the appearance of a conflict
to damage the workings of justice .
so he appointed a special prosecutor .
lucky for me , i &apos;ve always been special .
no , you &apos;ve always been a corrupt prick .
it just took me a while to realize it .
and it took me a while to realize
that you don &apos;t have a speck of loyalty in your entire body .
loyalty is a two @-@ way street ,
and you ran me off the road .
so what are you gonna do ?
you gonna let jessica fight your fight like you did last time ,
or you gonna run away
like you did when you left the d.a. &apos; s office ?
neither one , cameron . but thank you .
for what ?
for reminding me that i don &apos;t run from a fight .
what was so important that
i had to come down here right away ?
don &apos;t tell me you want a bigger office .
you told me that i can think of this office
as a reminder of what i did to harvey
or as a symbol of what i can do at this firm .
but the thing is i don &apos;t wanna be here
if i &apos;m not solid with harvey .
well , that &apos;s between you and harvey .
it &apos;s between you and me .
you put yourself between us when you blackmailed me .
well , the word you &apos;re looking for is extortion ,
not blackmail ,
and i &apos;m not going to comment on that accusation .
but as for your choices ,
you made those all by yourself .
so don &apos;t come crying to me .
this is a copy of the letter you wrote to the district attorney
when you threatened to expose me .
expose you ? for what ?
i never wrote a letter like that .
i &apos;m not recording you .
i don &apos;t need to record you .
this letter was printed from your hard drive ,
which has your computer &apos;s digital signature .
what do you want ?
i wanna know , if you had the chance ,
would you have traded that car
to get your parents back together ?
that &apos;s a stupid goddamn question ,
and you know it .
i never had that chance ,
so what does it matter ?
because i do .
what do i want ?
i wanna give this office back .
i didn &apos;t earn it , i don &apos;t want it ,
and if there &apos;s a chance it &apos;ll help harvey forgive me ,
i &apos;m gonna take it .
oh , and , uh ,
if you ever do send that letter ,
you &apos;re in the same boat as me .
harvey , you &apos;re looking determined .
i am .
what can i do for you ?
look , i know we had an arrangement ,
but i came here to change it .
change it ?
but you might not even win .
i &apos;ve just heard about this new special prosecutor .
relax , the case was always gonna be hard .
it just got a little harder .
because you made it that way .
that &apos;s my problem .
and now you &apos;re using that increased difficulty
to renegotiate our deal .
that &apos;s your problem .
we both know how important ava is to you .
what do you want ?
i don &apos;t wanna run from a fight .
meaning ?
i win ,
you don &apos;t fire me ,
you back me for managing partner .
you want to take down jessica .
