and the burkes are going to washington .
i have some news of my own .
i reached out to the national gallery .
they just called me and offered me a position .
no more handlers , no more cases ,
no more anklet .
i &apos;ve talked to a lawyer .
a recommendation from you is critical .
the mosconi codex ...
if this book is a puzzle ,
maybe these are the pieces .
take a look at the pages . rain man it .
i got it .
this is the idol of sita .
the idol had eyes made out of rare diamonds .
the hope diamond . we &apos;re looking for its twin .
mosconi &apos;s symbols aren &apos;t a message .
they &apos;re numbers .
real name is rachel turner .
she is the prime suspect
in the murders of curtis hagen
and agent david siegel .
neal , she &apos;s in love with you .
you &apos;re under arrest for murder .
i &apos;m impressed , neal . that was well played .
what &apos;s the threat ?
i &apos;ll see you soon .
this is agent burke .
peter , what is it ?
rebecca escaped .
we have an inmate loose . repeat , inmate loose .
prisoner rk4431 is no longer in her cell .
the metropolitan corrections center is reporting
an armed and dangerous escapee in the vicinity .
rachel turner , a.k.a. rebecca lowe .
is this some kind of message ?
&quot; anything you can do , i can do too &quot; ?
i doubt it .
she walked right out the door in uniform ,
in uniform , same way you did once .
hey , i didn &apos;t have to hurt anyone to break out of prison .
the c.o. &apos; s in pretty rough shape ,
but she &apos;ll survive .
when did this happen ?
when she was escorted to the yard
for her hour of exercise yesterday .
she used a stethoscope
she cribbed from the infirmary to strangle her .
another 30 seconds , she &apos;d have been dead .
rebecca &apos;s former law enforcement .
she &apos;s got the skill set of a trained agent .
with the instincts of a criminal .
this is what we do , neal , you and me .
let &apos;s track this .
her first step on the run .
what would it be ?
on the run , the first thing she &apos;d do
is change her appearance-- quick hair cut ,
decent dye job .
she &apos;d want to be invisible .
she &apos;d also need to be mobile .
she &apos;d get a car .
but something that doesn &apos;t stick out ,
something-- something non @-@ descript .
she &apos;d also need new credentials .
who would she go to here in new york ?
who would she go to here in new york ?
she doesn &apos;t need to go to anyone .
she &apos;s a professional , and every professional
has a go bag .
we already have hers .
well , i underestimated her .
anyone this good would have several ready and waiting .
driver &apos;s license , passport ,
currency--she &apos;ll have everything she needs .
but if i &apos;m her , i &apos;m not leaving this city
without the one thing i want .
the diamond .
yeah , she killed siegel , used and murdered hagen ,
manipulated me and everyone in my life to get to it .
you don &apos;t go through all that for nothing .
hey , june .
we &apos;ll be right there .
oh , thank goodness , thank goodness .
i tried to call 911 .
which , as we all know , is a joke .
truly , there &apos;s no need .
what &apos;s with all the extra wing @-@ tips ?
you said rebecca was here .
what happened ?
i was asleep ,
but i heard a noise .
she must have come in through the balcony .
i didn &apos;t see her .
i was leaving you a voice message
when--i don &apos;t know . she knocked me out .
the least i can do is make you some tea .
something a little stronger .
wing @-@ tips , would you like some coffee ?
yeah , give us a moment .
thank you , june .
of course .
what &apos;s going on with your arm ?
it &apos;s been sore since i woke up .
it &apos;s a needle mark .
she injected you with something ?
it could be sodium pentothal .
truth serum ?
i could be under its influence right now .
break any laws recently ?
absolutely none .
definitely not truth serum .
what if i told her about my breakthrough ?
she could have taken the next step .
she might have the diamond .
rachel .
or should i still call you rebecca ?
don &apos;t bother trying to keep me on the line .
this is a simple trade .
i &apos;m not making any deals with you .
the diamond for your friend &apos;s life .
what ?
i gave him a lethal dose of a highly toxic poison .
very soon , he &apos;ll start showing signs .
five to six hours from now , he &apos;ll be dead .
you &apos;re lying .
you can take him to the hospital if you like .
by the time the doctors are finished running their tests ,
he &apos;ll be long gone .
get me what i want .
so now you can &apos;t even do your own dirty work ?
i &apos;ve got a few people looking for me .
better you find the diamond .
i &apos;ll give you the antidote in exchange .
leave a message on this line once you have it .
oh , and , neal ,
it &apos;s nice to hear your voice again .
presbyterian isn &apos;t far .
if we go now ...
no death centers .
it &apos;s a hospital .
oh , they &apos;ll have a bar @-@ coded tramp stamp on me
before the first i.v. drip .
moz , will you please be reasonable ?
why are we wasting our time arguing ?
we are on the verge of discovering
the twin of the hope diamond .
your life is on the line .
rebecca &apos;s probably bluffing .
i feel ... absolutely okay .
look , we can find the antidote .
i &apos;m taking you to a hospital right now .
the diamond is the antidote ,
and you need my help to find it .
who knows more about masonic lore than yours truly ?
all right . fill me in .
neal said you had some kind of breakthrough with symbols ?
yeah .
slow down .
we &apos;ve been looking at them as letters ,
when we should be looking at them as numbers .
numbers from where ?
an old hindu numerical system ,
probably mosconi &apos;s inspiration ,
given the origin of the diamond .
do we have any idea what they mean ?
i &apos;m working on it , but it &apos;s tough .
these last two , i don &apos;t know what they are .
they &apos;re the only ones that don &apos;t correspond .
they &apos;re coordinates .
you have 14 numbers .
seven and seven in a particular order .
latitude and longitude .
could be .
and these two symbols you can &apos;t decode--
probably cardinal directions .
i think mosconi was telling us
where he hid that diamond .
punching in the numbers now starting with north by east .
经度
乌兹根
kyrgyzstan .
doubtful the diamond
is in my least favorite parliamentary republic .
oh , they still have a practice there called marriage by capture .
sounds familiar .
keep working .
trying south by west ,
经度
which leads us to somewhere in chile .
里奥内格罗
mosconi never had any kind of history there .
try north and west .
皇后区
托腾堡
it &apos;s a stone fort . in queens .
stone . probably made by masons .
fort totten was built in 1862
for the civil war .
so it existed when mosconi was in new york city .
if i have a priceless diamond that needs safekeeping ,
what better place than a u.s. military installation ?
i &apos;ll let the fbi know we &apos;re checking it out ourselves .
let &apos;s go .
okay .
hey , that was peter .
there &apos;s a problem with caffrey &apos;s pal .
it &apos;s serious .
something &apos;s happened to mozzie ?
he was poisoned by rebecca lowe .
he &apos;s okay for now ,
but apparently he only has a few hours left .
you okay ?
do they know what it is ?
no . not a clue . it &apos;s a mystery .
and i guess they don &apos;t have enough time to wait for the blood test .
let me check all recent nypd incident reports
for any thefts at a doctor &apos;s office , pharmacy ,
or lab since rebecca &apos;s escape .
she had to get the toxins from somewhere .
all right . here we go .
a few residential b &amp; es .
convenience store robbery in williamsburg .
mugging in midtown .
that &apos;s interesting .
what ? hanawalt pharmaceuticals ?
looks like some kind of greenhouse .
yeah , a lot of prescription meds
start out as poisonous plants .
robbery happened after the main lab closed .
yeah , this could be it . and , according to this ,
nypd &apos;s currently on the scene , which is where i should be .
you want to come with ?
hey , if you need me , you got me .
peter burke , fbi .
this is my associate , neal caffrey .
this is my ... mozzie .
agent burke , right , your offices called ,
said you were on the way .
i &apos;m hopper . alan hopper .
ranger hopper , actually . what &apos;s all this about ?
we believe there &apos;s a vital piece
of information inside that could lead us
to the capture of a known fugitive .
we &apos;re in a bit of a hurry .
copy that .
let &apos;s take a bad guy off the streets .
structure &apos;s named after joseph totten ,
u.s. army officer and engineer known as the father
of brick fortification .
foundation &apos;s mostly granite .
well , he had to make some modifications
when the rifled @-@ bored cannon arrived .
well , i think we can take it from here .
i really appreciate your cooperation .
anything i can do to help .
you know , if you could coordinate with my offices
and keep me apprised of any developments , that &apos;d be great .
i &apos;ll get on the horn right now , chief .
nice . let &apos;s start looking .
mosconi must have left some kind of trail .
there are a million different hiding spots in this place .
we need some direction .
yeah .
i don &apos;t see any distinctive markings or clues .
keep looking . we &apos;ve come too far .
&quot; death is nothing , but to live defeated
and inglorious is to die daily . &quot;
napoleon ?
an unwavering man , he would stop at nothing
to find the hope diamond &apos;s twin rock .
neither will we .
are you okay ?
yeah , perfectly fine .
it &apos;s just a little hot out here .
my pulse is up a little .
it &apos;s probably just the heat , though .
we may have to drag him to a hospital ,
kicking and screaming if need be .
he says he &apos;s feeling fine .
moz insisted on coming . that &apos;s his choice .
but understand , i look at him as more than a resource .
resource ? you think i &apos;m using him ?
yeah , i think you &apos;ll do whatever it takes
to catch rebecca .
33 .
what &apos;s 33 ?
33 steps .
the winding staircase , peter .
did you just call him peter ?
who , the suit ?
okay , maybe he &apos;s worse than i thought .
look , your symptoms are manifesting .
what &apos;s manifesting are the answers .
to the masons , the winding staircase
was considered a theological ladder .
ladder ?
yeah , representing an ascent
from a lower sphere of consciousness to a higher one .
we need to climb !
moz , hold on to the rail .
26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ... 30
i don &apos;t see anything .
but i &apos;m certain that mosconi wanted us to notice .
notice what ?
i don &apos;t know !
okay , okay , stay calm .
stay calm ?
i &apos;m hours away from palming st. peter a20
to get past the gate .
calm is not an option .
freemasons may control the world ,
but not my fate .
they have their hand everywhere-
the all @-@ seeing eye of the $ 1 bill ,
the washington monument ,
mj &apos;s dangerous album cover .
we &apos;re here . the 33rd degree .
the magic number .
the highest level of understanding .
so why can &apos;t i see ?
moz !
oh . now i see .
moz .
whatever it is has been in his system
for about four hours now .
the doctors will run tests
as soon as we get him to the icu .
he doesn &apos;t have time for tests .
go to the hexagon .
find my antidote .
i called elizabeth .
she &apos;s gonna be at the hospital with you .
you &apos;re not gonna be alone . understand ?
we have to move him now .
when he fell , he saw something .
yeah , he said , &quot; now i see . &quot;
he was looking at the ceiling .
this is the hexagon he saw .
it &apos;s made of brick , not granite .
yeah , and it &apos;s unlike the rest of the fort .
does a hexagon mean anything to the masons ?
not that i remember .
they were masters of geometry ,
but the shape they were obsessed with was the triangle .
six triangles form a hexagon .
yeah , if we look at this as six triangles ,
they all meet at the same point .
moz said this was all about ascension--
the 33rd degree , the highest level of enlightenment .
you think we need to go higher ?
yeah , i think we need to get up on the roof .
she &apos;s playing with us .
she knew we &apos;d track her here .
it could take days to test him for all of these .
and by then , whatever it is will be listed
as the cause of death .
beautiful and clever enough to con caffrey .
hell , even i could have fallen for this psychopath .
yeah , me too .
right there . i think i saw something .
you see how she moved out of camera range
and stepped back in ?
let &apos;s see what &apos;s back there .
all right .
all right , i &apos;m pretty sure
this is directly above where we were .
it &apos;s an old flag pole base .
any idea what it could mean ?
back when this fort was operational ,
they used wind flags to discern
how best to fire a cannon .
how do you know that ?
we used wind flags for firearm training at quantico .
essentially , this is a compass centered around 360 degrees .
hey , it &apos;s all about degrees .
33 to achieve enlightenment .
what are you getting at ?
i think we need to look 33 degrees
from this position .
all right .
if true north is 0 degrees ,
then 33 degrees points to there .
that building .
notice anything about it ?
yeah , it &apos;s brick ,
and it &apos;s another triangle .
this was a gunpowder room .
yeah , probably the most guarded place
in the entire fort at the time .
what do you have ?
this part of the wall isn &apos;t brick .
it &apos;s clay .
looks like brick , though .
it &apos;s pretty hardened .
some alkaline textures can thicken over time .
especially when they &apos;re coated in oil .
oil , as in oil paints ?
mosconi was a great artist .
i think he painted over the clay
so no one would notice this spot on a first
or even a second glance .
this is a faux painting .
there &apos;s something behind this wall .
still have your lockpick set ?
always .
care to do the honors ?
we found it .
i don &apos;t know about you ,
but i &apos;m feeling pretty enlightened right now .
it &apos;s the mona lisa of gems .
every museum and collector in the world will want it .
how much is it worth ?
60 million .
or the life of a paranoid bald man .
it &apos;s voice mail .
rebecca , i found it .
i &apos;m holding it in my hand right now .
rebecca ?
i knew you &apos;d find it .
where do we make the exchange ?
the drinking fountain at the northeast corner
of washington square park . one hour .
i get the stone , you get the antidote ,
and mozzie will live to pontificate another day .
all right , i &apos;m leaving now .
and , neal , if there &apos;s any tricks--
if i spot one fbi agent , and you know i will--
i disappear , and your friend will have a slow , painful death .
can &apos;t wait to see you .
what are you doing ?
getting backup units ready .
we can &apos;t take that risk .
it &apos;s a simple exchange .
we give her the diamond ,
she gives us the antidote .
what makes you think she &apos;ll keep her promise ?
because she won &apos;t do anything to hurt me .
that includes letting moz die .
as long as we have the diamond , we have control .
with criminals , control is everything .
i know the buyer she &apos;ll contact .
i can find her .
you &apos;re an expert at being a criminal ,
and i &apos;m an expert at catching them .
we can save mozzie
and put her back where she belongs .
this is agent peter burke . i &apos;m calling in a tactical alert .
escaped prisoner rebecca lowe will be
at washington square park in one hour .
set up an invisible perimeter two blocks from the park .
i want spotters on every roof .
wait .
but no one enters the park .
no one . you got that ?
it &apos;s too easy .
tell them i &apos;m on my way .
rebecca &apos;s smarter than this .
she has to have another plan .
right again , neal .
hands where i can see &apos; em , agent burke .
you too , neal . hands up .
move it , burke . keep going .
caught you with your guard down .
not the first time .
nice haircut , by the way .
ah , it &apos;s the real me .
give me your gun , agent burke .
slowly .
okay , no problem .
you can always count on love to cloud your critical thinking .
first with me , then with mozzie .
i doubt you could relate .
you &apos;d be surprised .
peter , don &apos;t .
play nice , agent burke .
killing feds does not keep me up at night .
just give it to her .
it &apos;s sweet how much neal cares
about the man who shackled him .
now your phones , both of them .
now , are we carrying backup , agent burke ?
show me the diamond .
spectacular .
i held up my end of the bargain .
now tell me the antidote .
i will . i promise .
as soon as i &apos;m safely out of the city .
that wasn &apos;t the deal .
it is now .
let &apos;s go .
in you go , burke .
ah , one last thing .
now i know what people mean when they say
their skin is crawling .
never bothered you before .
you &apos;re the boy scout of con men .
always prepared .
go . get in .
we can &apos;t stop you now .
just tell us the antidote .
one mistake i &apos;ll never make again is underestimating you .
bye , neal .
could have had a hell of a time .
ricinus communis .
ricin is produced from its beans .
very deadly .
based on the footprints , it looks like she spent
some time with this plant .
this could be it , unless she thinks
we &apos;re dumb enough to follow them here .
yeah , that &apos;s what &apos;s bothering me .
a lot of footprints around this one .
yeah , but none over there .
and it looks like the dirt was brushed over .
atropos belladonna .
commonly known as deadly nightshade .
so it &apos;s definitely poisonous ?
as little as two berries or one leaf can kill a grown man .
rebecca was trained by mi5 , but we learned
from someone far sneakier .
caffrey .
it &apos;s a misdirect .
she was trying to lead us
towards those plants and away from this one .
things are getting really bad .
he thinks he &apos;s someone named marquis de grouchy ,
and he &apos;s talking to napoleon .
actually , that &apos;s the name
of napoleon &apos;s top general at waterloo .
we think she gave mozzie atropos belladonna .
tell the doctor to give him a drug called physostigmine .
physostigmine ?
are you positive ?
no .
but it &apos;s our best shot .
they said to give him a drug , physostigmine , now . right now .
that &apos;s for belladonna poisoning .
we haven &apos;t got the results from the test back yet .
doctor , please .
the side effects could be serious--
seizures , irregular heart rhythms ,
even epilepsy .
i &apos;m not giving it until the tests come back .
it might be too late .
i &apos;ll tell them to rush
the tests on belladonna .
he could be dead by then !
give it to him ! give it to him now !
prepare 50 milligrams of physostigmine ,
but have injections of lorazepam
and epinephrine standing by
in case he has a bad reaction .
merci .
i &apos;ve seen you slip out of handcuffs
in less than a minute with nothing .
right . when they &apos;re on my wrists .
there &apos;s an old escape artist trick
i use when they &apos;re being put on .
pump the veins and muscles in your wrists and hands ,
and when you relax them ,
they &apos;re smaller and you can slide off the cuffs .
i &apos;ve given you way too much insight into my world .
i thought you were leaving that world .
well , not tethered to an anklet .
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got ? an old trick ?
unless you got a paper clip .
step aside , houdini . i &apos;ll get us out of here .
oh , if i knew you were looking for a more elegant option .
it &apos;ll work . now kick .
on three , all right ?
a little teamwork .
yeah .
one ... two ... three .
you hear that ?
it &apos;s the smartest way off this island .
yeah , which is usually her way .
agent burke !
all right .
you were right .
agent burke !
agent burke ?
agent burke , your wife called .
is it mozzie ?
yes , sir .
i was to report to you that he &apos;s been given an antidote .
he &apos;s responding to treatment .
give me your phone now .
there &apos;s no reception down here , sir .
we &apos;ll need to go out front .
i &apos;m going after r ebecca .
wait for me . i &apos;m calling for backup .
there &apos;s no time .
what can you do to stop her ?
give her a reason to stay .
rebecca !
don &apos;t come any closer . i won &apos;t graze you this time .
can that helicopter take both of us ?
that diamond could buy us a nice castle in croatia .
we could live like royalty .
sounds perfect .
the fbi &apos;s not listening . it &apos;s just you and me .
and that helicopter can take us anywhere we want to go .
how many times
do you think i &apos;m gonna fall for that ?
you don &apos;t want me . you &apos;ve made that very clear .
i think you &apos;ll stay anyway .
why would i stay ?
&apos;cause you won &apos;t leave without the diamond .
what are you talking about ?
check your pocket .
check it .
ah , nothing says &quot; i love you &quot;
like a brick .
you .
you son of a bitch .
hey , just a little sleight of hand .
no big deal .
maybe your critical thinking got clouded .
i love how good you are .
i hate how good you are .
give me the diamond .
i can &apos;t .
neal , don &apos;t make me kill you .
i &apos;ll just take it off your beautiful , dead body .
i don &apos;t have it anymore .
where is it ?
local law enforcement and every fbi agent
in new york are on their way .
yes , sir . i &apos;ll coordinate everything .
you just killed your best friend .
no , mozzie &apos;s recovering as we speak .
looks like he &apos;s out of the woods .
oh , and you &apos;re in the weeds .
where are you going ?
he &apos;s gone , and he &apos;s not coming back .
he must have heard it over the radio .
every law enforcement officer in new york
is headed here right now .
then i &apos;ll just trade you for the diamond .
you &apos;re going to get me out of here ,
one way or another .
rebecca , you have to know when it &apos;s over .
sometimes , you have to stop running .
it &apos;s beautiful here .
well , the leaf of one plant strikes me down ,
the fruit of another restores me .
the circle of life .
do you really think you should be drinking
this soon after waterloo , grouchy ?
doctor &apos;s orders .
i was instructed to drink a lot of liquids .
so where is this gem i almost cashed in all my chips to get ?
is that real ?
they didn &apos;t make fakes that good in 1886 .
can i hold it ?
you know , after he had the hope diamond cut ,
louis xiv would wear it on his pinkie .
he had grotesquely large fingers .
so is this diamond our path to easy street ?
yeah , who actually , you know , owns that ?
it &apos;s my duty as a federal officer
to turn it over to the state department .
glad you &apos;re feeling better , moz . you ready ?
that diamond is not meant to be under bulletproof glass
with a bunch of tourists in bermuda shorts gawking at it .
better than being lost behind a brick wall .
see ya .
see ya .
hey , thanks for going all terms of endearment on the doctor for me .
it was fun .
okay , that diamond is ours , neal .
we are gonna get it back .
you want to rob the state department ?
well , it hasn &apos;t gone there yet .
it &apos;s our meal ticket .
it &apos;s supposed to set us up for life ,
in a perversely legitimate fashion .
there is no reason to go after it illegitimately .
come on , moz .
it was never about the money .
of course not , but we could--
you think , if it goes missing , peter won &apos;t know the first place to look ?
my freedom is worth more than anything that diamond could buy .
sure it is .
except your freedom still eludes you .
am i in trouble ?
nope . no trouble .
did rebecca escape again ?
oh , she &apos;s not going anywhere . ever .
then what ?
did i get a new handler ? who &apos;s the lucky agent ?
no one .
well , it certainly isn &apos;t you .
you still look like you &apos;re going somewhere .
i made a call to bruce in washington .
i filled him in on your capture of rebecca lowe .
i told him you deserve your freedom .
peter ...
he agreed .
he &apos;s meeting with the fbi director to put your release in motion .
once he signs off ,
it should only take a call to the attorney general to get it done .
when ?
shouldn &apos;t be more than a couple of days .
but there is one condition .
what ?
you visit el and me in washington a lot .
i will be the house guest that never leaves .
and if you don &apos;t keep your promise ,
if i find out you &apos;ve pulled even one caper ,
i &apos;m gonna leave my cushy desk job and hunt you down .
just like old times .
with the same outcome .
all right .
i &apos;ll see you in d.c.
you got it .
not getting the diamond changes everything .
well , finding it helped buy my freedom ,
and that is everything .
except you &apos;ll be broke ,
without even a government check to pay your rent .
you don &apos;t know how good that sounds .
no worries . there &apos;s a lot of top feeders just out of range
just waiting to be scaled .
i &apos;m done , moz .
i &apos;m giving up the life .
oh , come on .
i &apos;m serious .
no more jobs . no more fish metaphors .
neal , if you &apos;re not a criminal ,
then what are you ?
that &apos;s what i want to find out .
you know , it &apos;s been five years since i &apos;ve seen paris ,
bangkok , istanbul .
when my anklet &apos;s off , we can go .
fine , and , while we &apos;re there , if a whale swims by ,
we can throw a harpoon .
a whale is not a fish ,
so that metaphor is acceptable .
monet kept painting even when he was too blind to find his easel .
mick jagger will keep touring until he drops dead on stage .
you have to continue doing what you &apos;re great at .
one of the many differences between mick jagger and i
is that i face prison again if i keep going .
that diamond was supposed to be our retirement .
the suit took that away .
he &apos;s helping you get your freedom ,
but with a future lacking in the finer things .
for you , that &apos;s like cutting off your oxygen .
paris without money .
is not the city of lights .
hey , honey , what time is the moving van coming tomorrow ?
oh , 8 o &apos;clock .
ooh , think we &apos;ll be ready ?
well , that &apos;s the thing about deadlines --
we have to be .
ugh , i &apos;m gonna tackle upstairs . no excuses for not joining me .
this is peter burke .
oh , hey , bruce .
perfect weather for shorts .
when i lose my anklet , i &apos;m gonna go out and buy a hundred pairs .
glad you could come by .
why the serious face ?
sit down .
oh , okay , i get it .
you pretend to look all serious , then tell me
how the fbi director and the attorney general discussed my case ,
and it wasn &apos;t as open and shut as they thought .
it should have been .
you &apos;ve never been one for the misdirect .
the attorney general was never called .
the fbi director reviewed your record .
he told bruce you blew any chance of an early release
because of your escape into cape verde last year .
what , and everything i &apos;ve done since doesn &apos;t matter ?
it likely mattered a lot .
we have the highest arrest record in the bureau .
yeah .
bruce thinks the real reason
he won &apos;t release you is because
you &apos;re such a big asset .
the bureau doesn &apos;t want to lose you .
i screwed myself .
if you weren &apos;t good ,
they would have revoked your deal and sent you back to prison .
so the game was rigged .
no , this isn &apos;t a game .
everything is .
don &apos;t do anything crazy , neal .
this isn &apos;t over .
you okay ?
how disappointed would you be if we didn &apos;t move to washington ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
my request to release neal was denied .
they want him to serve his sentence at white collar .
that &apos;s not fair . he earned it .
exactly how i feel .
and now you don &apos;t want to go to d.c.
it &apos;s all bureaucracy , el .
i mean , guys sitting behind desks ,
making decisions about other people &apos;s lives
without being a part of those lives on a daily basis .
it &apos;s not me .
well , honey , if--
if this is what you feel you need to do ,
then of course i &apos;m okay .
maybe i &apos;ll just -- i &apos;ll commute back and forth .
we could talk every night ,
and it could be fun to catch up on weekends .
if that &apos;s what you feel you need to do .
babe , it &apos;s the national gallery .
i mean , this is a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity .
you wouldn &apos;t expect not to take the job
just because you changed your mind .
i wouldn &apos;t . no .
so the moral of this story -- the suit can &apos;t be trusted .
it wasn &apos;t peter .
that you know of , but , really , what &apos;s the difference ?
suits by any other name are still the enemy .
the question is , what now ?
i cracked your old anklet . i can crack this one .
but the real question remains , do you want me to ?
i want my freedom .
any way i can get it .
give me a week , and we &apos;ll be back in business .
try to make it sooner .
restock your liquor cabinet .
why are you following me ?
who are you ?
i &apos;m about to become the last person on earth who knows where you are .
