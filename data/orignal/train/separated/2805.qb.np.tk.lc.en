oh , come on !
it &apos;s your thanksgiving too . instead of watching football , you could help .
we know .
you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles .
no , you want to put them in concentric circles .
i want to do this .
every year .
the one with the football
to the 10 , to the 5 . touchdown , giants !
you know , for once , i am gonna try to watch one of these things .
halftime .
who wants to throw the ball around ? get a little 3 @-@ on @-@ 3 going ?
that would be fun !
can i play too ?
i &apos;ve never played football , ever .
great ! you can cover chandler .
i don &apos;t really want to play .
you never do anything since you and janice broke up .
not true .
i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day .
and start drinking in the morning . don &apos;t say i don &apos;t have goals !
you have to start getting over her , all right ?
if you play , maybe it &apos;ll take your mind off janice .
if you don &apos;t , everyone will be mad at you because the teams won &apos;t be even .
all right , i &apos;ll play .
but l don &apos;t like you .
let &apos;s do it ! ross ?
what ?
wanna play football ?
monica and i aren &apos;t supposed to play football .
says who ? your mom ?
&quot; what do you mean ? &quot; she asks her boyfriend ...
... really scared to hear the answer .
every thanksgiving , we used to have a touch football game ...
... called the geller bowl .
no , no , no . you say that proudly !
anyway , ross and l were always captains .
it got kind of competitive , and one year , geller bowl vl ...
... i accidentally broke ross &apos; nose .
it was so not an accident .
she saw i was about to tag her , so she threw ...
... her big fat grandma @-@ arm elbow in my face ...
... and just kept running .
to score the winning touchdown , by the way .
you did not win the game . the touchdown didn &apos;t count ...
... because of the spectacularly illegal , and savage , nose @-@ breaking .
i won the game .
yeah ? then how come you didn &apos;t get the geller cup ?
there was a geller cup ?
yes , the trophy you got if you won the game .
but dad said nobody won , and he was sick of our fighting .
so he took the trophy ...
... threw it in the lake .
and was the curse lifted ?
anyway ...
... mom said we weren &apos;t allowed to play football again .
you know what ? i think we should play a game .
i mean , come on . it &apos;s been 12 years .
can i see you for a second ?
wuss !
all right , we &apos;re gonna play .
wait . how we gonna get there ? my mom won &apos;t let me cross the street .

we have to pick captains .
and then &quot; tennille . &quot;
so how do we decide that ?
why don &apos;t we just bunny up ?

first , i don &apos;t play with cheaters .
second of all , you know i had swollen glands !

you got to pick first , so you got the better team .
pathetic ! why can &apos;t you just accept that we &apos;re winning ...
... because i &apos;m better than you ?
oh , what a great argument . exhaling !
all right , i &apos;ll prove it to you .
i &apos;ll trade you joey for rachel and i &apos;ll still win the game .
oh , that &apos;s great.there goes my last shred of self @-@ esteem .
what ? the guys against the girls ?
that &apos;s ridiculous because i &apos;m only down by three touchdowns .
then bring it on !
unless you &apos;re afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls .
fine . rachel , you &apos;re with monica . joey , you &apos;re with me .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re trading me .
you are going to lose .
and you are going to lose.and ....

let &apos;s see what it &apos;s like to be on a winning team for a change .
you &apos;re gonna let me play ?
all right , then !
the game is over ? we eat now ?
the game &apos;s not over . we &apos;re switching teams .
chandler finds me so intimidating that it &apos;s better if we &apos;re on the same team .
okay , let &apos;s play . let &apos;s go .
hold on a second .
where do dutch people come from ?
well , the pennsylvania dutch come from pennsylvania .

two points , ladies .
phoebe , you do a buttonhook again .
rachel , you go long .
no , don &apos;t make me go long . use me . they never cover me .
