Stop dumping. Stop dumping.
What is matter?
Lower your bed.
You can't dump here no more. Talk to your boss.
Always we are dumping here.
Put the shit back in your truck.
What? That is huge job!
Where I am supposed to dump this?
I just now find out it's asbestos you've been dumping over there.
What did you think it was?
I never asked.
Tampax. What the fuck do I know?
Well, now you know.
You and Stefano
have been pocketing how much on this cowboys-and-lndians asbestos removal?
Checkout to Municipal Government
Billing the townships like you're following all the EPA regulations.
You got the same scam, so cut through the bullshit.
How much you figure you're owed?
25%.
Don't be an asshole.
There's close monitoring at every landfill.
If somebody had been upfront...
Nobody's been hiding nothing.
I've had the same dumping deal with the operations manager
since I've been at Barone Sanitation.
You're not there no more. I am. You're enjoying your severance package.
25%. That's not gonna happen.
You've got a backyard, a pool. Dump it there.
That's my only other suggestion.
He's got us by the cazz'.
Unless that guy at the landfill decides to play ball.
He's shitting his pants he'll get pinched by the EPA.
Frankly, Tone,
I'm thinking maybe we should meet Phil's number.
Why? I think that would set a terrible precedent right now.
Just bend over
when he just became boss of the family over there?
Yeah, well, that's the fly in the ointment.
Even still, I say let him have it.
Life's too short.
It's also too short to live it as a fucking lackey.
True too.
Is this "Make-Believe Ballroom"?
How many times you gonna change the stations?
The Departed soundtrack's killer.
You got it?
Yeah, it's good.
Regarding Phil, I gotta ask,
whatever happened to "stop and smell the roses"?
You're right. You're right.
You can't fight every fucking battle, right?
Asbestos.
Each day's a gift.
Every time I look at my kid, that's what I realise.
And that shit with Junior, please.
Just that people like Phil,
they're not on that page.
Take those roses and stick 'em up your ass, thorns first.
This system's got no balls.
So how was your party that day at the house?
Slow the fuck down, will you?
Maybe you should go back, Heidi.
I'm on my learner's permit after dark.
You gotta help me.
I'm coming.
I'll never pass the drug test.
What?
You gotta get me out.
I'll lose my licence.
Never pass a drug test.
Call me a taxi.
We've been in an accident.
Old Pumping Station Road,
past the reservoir.
Sorry about that.My friend,
guy I came with, how is he?
Your friend is dead. The paramedics called it in the ambulance.
Breathe in, please. Hold it.
Do you know a contact number for his next of kin?
His wife.
Hello.
May I speak with Carmela Soprano?
Who is this? -El Rosario Nurse,
St Clare's Hospital, Denville. Is Mrs Soprano there?
Yes, this is Mrs Soprano.
I'm here with your husband. He'd like to speak with you.
Carm.
Tony, is everything OK?
Are you sitting down?
I'm serious.
Yes, I'm in bed.
Listen.
Sweetheart, there's been an accident.
We were coming back from the city...
Christopher's dead.
Oh, my God!
All right.
Carm.
What happened?
He drove off the road and the car flipped over.
I'll tell you in detail.
Are you OK?
I banged my knee, the one from high school.
I'm fine, but
he wasn't wearing a belt.
Where are you, St Clare's?
Listen, they're gonna call Kelli
if they haven't already.
Just get Al and Rita on the phone and get 'em started over there.
All right. Oh, my God, Tony, he's dead?
Yeah.
All right. Let me get dressed.
Thank you.
Mr Tony, Mr Sil is here.
OK.
Mrs Carmela say you should stay in bed.
Have him come up.
We're right here, Tone.
We came as soon as we heard.
Patsy went to Chrissy's mom's house.
That's where Carmela is.
Carlo's coming up.
Yeah.
How you doing, Tone?
My knee got banged up.
They said it'll probably be OK.
Last thing I remember was
pulling away from Phil.
Skid marks all over the place, the cops told Carm.
He had a heavy foot, that kid, always.
Almost put me through a billboard once.
Hey, Tone.
Come on in.
I'm so sorry, Tone.
I still can't believe it.
Thanks. I know you two were close.
I was making my collections and
Anthony Maffei called me. Jesus.
It's Carlo, I bet.
Fucking idiot didn't even have his seat belt on.
His chest filled up.
Suffocated on his own blood.
Oh, Jesus. -Poor kid.
Seems like that's the cause of death.
It's not Carlo. I heard AJ.
Carlo's coming up?
What's with you and Carlo's arrival?
I'm just saying.
They're gonna do a full blood test on him.
See, you know,
if alcohol,
drugs or...
It did occur to me.
He didn't seem high, did he?
Are you kidding?
I would have been furious.
I would have strangled him.
He'd been working the programme
since he threw Little Paulie out that window.
Let's not go there.
Even before that he was battling that shit.
He gave it his all.
Well, anyway, he's gone now, our Chrissy.
Crazy fucking maniac.
The thing to take to heart,
T, you're here.
You're all right.
You could have been killed.
What are you gonna do?
Thanks.
What are you doing?
I gotta try and get up.
I gotta go and meet Carm over at Chrissy's.
Kelli and all that.
I'll make you a plate.
Get me a Scotch.
Are you serious?
Yeah, and have one yourself.
They were close, the two cousins.
You all right?
I know I had my differences with that kid,
but maybe I didn't do right by him, neither.
If you were his dad, I was his Dutch uncle,
and what the fuck did I do but get pissed off,
fight with him over cocksucking fucking money?
I'd break his balls when he tried not to have a drink
or a little taste of snow.
It's over, Paulie.
Did anybody ever hear from the hospital?
I was waiting till Kelli woke up.
They found cocaine in his blood.
Cause of death was a haemothorax.
Airbags can crush the ribs when there's no other restraint.
They said he might have made it,
but he didn't.
Couldn't have worn his seat belt?
No wonder. He was whack-a-doo.
Al, stop it.
Baloney. He leaves our granddaughter fatherless.
My only child!
Drinking won't help, honey.
Look at this. Syracuse is losing.
I don't know what to say.
What?
I just got a call from Little Paulie.
Nucci Gualtieri died.
Stroke on the bus back to the home.
They had gone to see Jersey Boys.
This is difficult.
This is pain like I'm not used to.
We've said before he was like a son in some ways.
To see him
die like that,
practically in my arms.
He was just starting his life.
Yeah.
You know what?
This is bullshit.
What?
I haven't been able to tell anybody this,
but... I'm fucking relieved.
Really?
He was a tremendous drag on my emotions,
on my thoughts about the future.
Every morning I wake up thinking,
ls today the day that one of my best friends is gonna
dime me to the FBl?
And a weak,
fucking snivelling, lying drug addict?
That's the worst kind of bet.
The biggest blunder of my career is now gone.
And I don't have to be confronted by that fact no more.
And as a relative, a friend,
someone you can count on...
I see.
Let me tell you something.
I've murdered friends before, even relatives,
my cousin Tony,
my best friend, Puss.
But this...
Was I talking in my sleep?
Snoring.
I'm gonna put on the TV if you don't mind.
I can't stay asleep. I'm all...
Can you make me a cappuccino?
That machine from Paulie, you need a pilot's licence.
It's so hard not to think of Christopher as a child, isn't it?
Caity kind of looks like him, which makes it doubly hard.
when she hits puberty, that schnoz.
A lot of women found him very attractive.
I think to myself,
how could I have ever said those things about him,
about him and Adriana, what her mother said he did to her?
Obviously he was violent as an adult, his upbringing,
but he adored Ade.
He could never let himself take her life.
Why are we so quick to blame?
What is the attraction in that?
It's good.
Thank you.
When I called you,
that night after the accident,
and you asked me,
"Oh, my God, Tony, he's dead?"
Yeah.
And I thought,
well, I thought I picked up a twinge of relief.
I picked up a twinge of relief.
What?
It just seemed like... I don't know...
You don't know what you're talking about.
OK, good, I'm wrong.
If you did pick up something like that,
maybe it's
because I was relieved that it was him and not you.
Well, don't feel bad about that. That makes sense.
To be going down to the hospital again at two in the morning?
And you know what? When you were shot,
it was Christopher who held me.
You know the baby's car seat?
A giant tree branch came through the window
and demolished it.
She would have been dead, Caitlin,
mangled beyond recognition.
I told her about the baby seat
so she wouldn't feel so rotten.
He was high as a fucking kite. I didn't tell her that.
In retrospect, maybe not the best approach.
Right. I'm the asshole again.
What?
No, go ahead.
It's amazing how things work.
His mother, my cousin Joanne,
a lush.
Totally abandoned him as a parent,
but now she's reaping all the sympathy
and the tears.
How are you doing, Anthony?
There have been some hard moments.
But a weak,
lying drug addict who fantasised about my downfall,
who even showed people his filthy thoughts
on a movie screen?
Let me tell you something. I've seen friends die before.
Accidents,
even murder.
My cousin Tony, they shot his face away.
And I was fucking prostate with grief.
But this?
I see.
It occurs to me,
I hand-carried this kid through the worst crisis he ever had.
I can't go into particulars,
but wives, girlfriends,
they can complicate life in a major way.
I don't have to tell you that.
Anyway, huge problem of his own making.
And he cried. He couldn't deal with it.
So
I took up the slack. I handled it.
I felt sorry for him.
Now he talked gratitude,
but guess what pity produces in the recipient.
They shit on your pity.
That's what broke the camel's back.
How are you handling all this?
The worst part, truthfully,
is I gotta sit there
with people who are hurting bad.
And I gotta have the long face
and the sighing and the platitudes.
But I don't feel it.
Then that makes me feel like a hypocrite.
And that makes me mad at them.
Hi.
How are you?
Julianna Skiffle,
this is my wife Carmela Soprano.
Skiff.
Yeah, right.
Julianna's a real estate agent in the old neighbourhood.
And you knew Christopher?
I used to buy my meat at Satriale's.
I'm a recovering addict.
I owe him a lot.
That's nice to hear.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Nothing you can do.
That's my point. - He was too young.
He was too young.
Good-looking woman.
They did a beautiful job on him.
I'm gonna go up.
I'll go up later.
Give my seat to someone in the meantime.
How are you doing?
It's tough.
Yeah.
He loved you so much.
Yeah?
Well, you know he did.
I'll go up later.
There she is. Three to five, seven to nine.
hy do they call her that?
She never misses a wake.
Oh, Lord! Fucking James Brown now.
I'm serious. I can't take it.
It's all right. We're here for you.
My God. Look at this.
Like a movie star.
Jackie Kennedy.
I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin.
Thanks.
Me too, bro, me too.
He was a good guy.
Don't let this linger on your head.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know that night,
a tree limb came in through the car window,
completely destroyed the baby seat.
Tony.
You guys are gonna hang in a while, right?
We should make an appearance at the other wake.
Are we that late?
Good you came.
He'll appreciate it. - Please.
I gotta get out of here.
保罗. - Tone.
Thanks for coming.
We are so sorry for your loss, Paulie.
How you hanging in, Paolucc'?
As well as can be expected.
Must be very hard for you.
I know how close you had become again.
Yeah.
Not much of a sendoff here.
The room is beautiful, Paulie.
Nobody's in it.
What kind of testament is this
to the spirit and generosity of the woman?
We're here for you, Paulie.
You know that.
It's a fundamental lack of respect
and I'm never gonna fucking forget it.
People your mother's age, their friends die off.
She outlived Sil? Carlo?
They're all over there at your nephew's.
Councilman Sirillo was here
three minutes.
People are coming and if they don't, fuck 'em.
I got 500 prayer cards.
Carm and I are here.
hat the fuck is that? Nothing?
No, Tone, of course not.
Means the world.
OK.
She suffered too, you know.
This isn't the time or the place.
You're right.
How have you been dealing with it?
It's really sad but it's kinda the same as with Blanca.
I don't really just keep thinking about things the way I did,
over and over, you know?
Well, for one thing, perhaps the meds are working.
Did you finally enrol?
I'm in a few classes unofficially,
until my transcript clears from Ramapo.
Beginning English.
And I went to a class on
the history of the lsraeli-Palestinian conflict.
It's hard to pick up in the middle. I might take it next semester.
I mean,
it's so dicked up over there
and no one knows who started it.
Are you sleeping?
What? In class?
No. You were having trouble, remember?
Wellbutrin XL kicks ass.
I'm hearing good things about Lexapro.
Check it, paisan. Long John shithead.
That kid's in my South American Lit class.
He had his toes amputated.
Said it was an accident with his car battery.
Acid burned through his shoe.
You little shfooyadell.
She should nurse.
At least somebody feels like eating.
She doesn't know.
Isn't God wonderful that way?
Hello? Alan, it's Tony. You busy?
Usual shit. Some Japanese guy
got his suit ruined at Cirque du Soleil.
Listen, I need a suite. All the guys coming out?
No. I'm solo.
We'll see what we can do about that.
Look, I just want to be alone.
Peace and quiet. Chill out.
You set for transpo? I'll be happy to send a plane.
No more bets.
33 black odd.
No more bets.
Five red odd.
It's hard to imagine for a poet,
but Wordsworth was as rich and popular
as, say, someone like
John Grisham nowadays.
But Wordsworth writes,
"The world is too much with us."
Later he invokes nature again.
Why such strong words against the material world?
That was fast.
The gatehouse usually
gives shitty directions to the east tower. Come in.
So...
You're a friend of Chris.
Yeah. Tony, by the way.
No, I know.
He's mentioned you, actually.
Except you're more beautiful than he let on.
Really? Talked about you a few times.
Told me more than once to look you up.
Did he?
Well, well, well.
You want a drink or something?
I got some pinot grigio in the fridge.
I got
some serious news.
It's about Christopher.
He's dead.
What?
It was a car accident,
happened a couple of days ago.
Oh, my God.
That's fucking awful.
Sorry.
What happened? Bad wreck,
high speed...
He was killed instantly.
Somehow I walked away.
Jesus, that must have been scary.
The fucking sound alone...
Did he ever
marry that one girl,the one who left him?
No.
Found a real sweetheart, though, Kelli.
They
just had a baby girl.
I mean,
bad that he left her,
but good that he left something.
I thought you should know.
Well...
Extremely cool, you coming over here. I appreciate that.
How long you here for?
I don't know.
Just play it as I go.
What's up?
It's Stefano.
I'm sorry to bother you but I'm here at the school.
The asbestos,it's backing up.
I gotta dump this shit.
It's not wrapped to code and all the other violations.
Yeah? I could get nailed big time.
We're working on it, John.
I'm trying to negotiate it out
but the asshole's taking a hard line.
Just hang in there, let me do my thing.
All right.
Jeff'll clean it up.
Make him clean it in his bare feet.
I got the venison steaks!
What the fuck?
You blind?
Me? You open the door, you don't look at all.
Shit, you wrecked my fucking door.
You did that to your own door.
What the fuck did you say?
I said he opened the door, he don't look at all.
Look at my fucking bike.
Do you hear this guy? You saw it.
Fuck you, nigger.
I am not a nigger.
I am from Somalia. I go to school and I work.
Do not call me a nigger.
You're some terrorist piece of shit.
Either way, you're in the wrong neighbourhood.
Get the fuck away!
You a tough nigger now?
You got something to say?
Cocksucker!
Do you mind?
No, knock yourself out.
This is...
This is the new shit.
Medical-grade, mellow,
paranoia-free.
Well, that's good.
Chris loved to party.
What's your point?
Nothing.
You just remind me of him, obviously.
What's that mean? I fuck like him?
So much for paranoia-free.
No, you were his friend, that's all.
Why would you bring him up?
All I'm saying is that
there's a certain kind of guy
that I don't run into on campus.
But where I dance,
that accent, the clothes.
I'm a type?
This coming from the girl who's stripping her way through college?
Actually, you're a surprise.
Chris sometimes talked about some sad shit,
but you seem,
I don't know, actually sad.
Not right now I'm not.
Jesus, this is some pretty fucking amazing dope.
Chris said you two
took peyote together.
Yeah.
I mean, I haven't done buttons in a while, though.
I've been thinking why the fuck I'm here.
You can get to that place.
No, I mean Vegas.
Truth is I always wanted to try that shit,
but I always
had all the responsibilities.
You're a hard man to reach.
Nobody's seen hide nor hair.
I'm away. What do you want?
What do I want? I'm returning your call.
This got nothing to do with asbestos.
Let go of the old shit and be a businessman.
You got everything you want.
Not everything.
But listen,
allow me to express my condolences regarding your nephew.
This is me hanging up.
I can tell you're upset.
Big fucking deal.
What exactly happened this week?
Nothing.
People walk around like this is all something.
They're fucking laughing
and nobody takes even one second to think about what's really going on.
what's really going on.
You sound depressed again.
How can anybody not be?
You'd have to be fucking nuts not to be.
You'd have to have your head
wedged so far up your ass
that all you could see is your own stupid face.
What specifically are you talking about?
I mean, everything is so fucked up.
Why can't we all just get along?
You don't have to chew it.
You just wash it down like a pill.
It's the same principle as the solar system.
No more bets.
24. Yes.
Nice.
Press it all.
No more bets.
20.
Holy fucking shit.
Here
Much appreciated.
No more bets.
He's dead.
What?
What?
What?
