i am not gonna help you do that !
oh , my god .
hi . i &apos;m here to see mr. campbell , with gucci .
the reservation &apos;s probably under gucci .

mr. campbell &apos;s not here yet . let me show you to his table .
oh , my god . that &apos;s my boss . you have to seat us somewhere else .
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s always mr. campbell &apos;s table .

mr. boss ..
it is a pleasure to meet you .
this place is so depressing . if i had to work here , i &apos;d kill myself .
but you obviously haven &apos;t .
how can i help you ?
i need to change my name , please .

you &apos;re fun .
you need to fill out this form .
okay . well , just so i know ..
i don &apos;t know how it works . my name is buffay ..
and my husband &apos;s name is hannigan .

so meet princess consuela bananahammock .
that &apos;s what we were gonna name the baby .
phoebe .

no , i &apos;m gonna have my friends call me valerie .
hey , how did the interview go ?
not good .
i always feel that way after an interview . i &apos;ll bet it went better than you think .
well , i didn &apos;t get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren .
that is a bad interview .
what are you talking about ? how did this happen ?
my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview ..
and he heard everything .
later , he calls me into his office and tells me he &apos;ll have to let me go ..
because i &apos;m not a team player .
and i said , &quot; wait a minute . yes , i am . &quot;
and then i had to sit there for 45 minutes ..
while he proved that that , in fact , was true .
oh , god , i &apos;m so sorry .
hey .

why , it &apos;s a bottle of champagne . why is this here ?
ross .

oh , you know what , you &apos;re gonna get it . i can feel it .
can you ?
all right , everybody , here &apos;s to ross .
and to years of hard work finally paying off .

that center around work .
to ross .
to ross .

what ?
fungus .
yeah . place is full of it .
no , it &apos;s not . we had an inspection and they didn &apos;t find anything .
okay . then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason .
maybe it &apos;s because you hung your head out the window like a dog ..
the whole ride here .
maybe .
so this is the living room , huh ? it &apos;s pretty dark .
no , it &apos;s not .
are you kidding ?
i think i just saw a bat in the corner .
when your head was hanging out the window , it didn &apos;t hit a mailbox , did it ?
maybe .
look , i just think you guys can do better than this house , you know ?
or any other house for that matter .
oh , joey .
we know you &apos;re having a hard time with this , but we ..
we love it here .
