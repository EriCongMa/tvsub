i can do that if you like .
i think i can handle notifying others , thank you very much .
annie , jeffrey , emergency meeting
at the school in 30 minutes .
i already know .
i &apos;m the one calling the meeting .

who is this other number ?
it &apos;s a group text .
i &apos;m texting you and jeffrey .
it &apos;s me .
i am jeffrey , best friend of dean .
hi , jeffrey .
dean , that number is not in my phone as jeff &apos;s ,
and it doesn &apos;t even look like an american phone number .
oh , my god .
how stupid can i get ?
you never told me you gave annie a fake phone number .
yes dean , this is me ,
jeffrey , you are best friend .
hold on , i &apos;ll cover .
you &apos;re right , i had the wrong number , he he ! see you at the school .
i am so sorry , jeffrey .
i hope i didn &apos;t get you in trouble .
no worries , dean .
i love you .
you &apos;re always so sweet , when we &apos;re texting ,
but then in real life .
bro , i just secret that way with love .
you know , my style .
we keep loving in text , but then secret forever .
meow .
meow .
annie , if you &apos;re not dying , i &apos;m gonna murder you .
i had to remove my night cream , it &apos;s $ 200 an ounce .
it &apos;s 3am in the fricking morning edison ,
what gives you the right to haul us in here .
chang , how did you even find out about this ?
i have a right to be here .
why are you awake ?
i have a theory about this , britta may be secretly twins .
no , i was working .
at the bar ? does that mean you &apos;re drunk ?
could a drunk person do this ?
hi , everybody .
jeffrey .
okay , 41 minutes ago ,
i received this email from a friend that interns at kzbc .
the tv station ?
no , the unrelated , totally random combination of those four letters .
meow .
subject heads up .
annie , still going to greendale ?
thought you should know ,
city college is running a negative ad about your school at 7am .
heard it &apos;s pretty bad .
let me see that .
city college is running an attack ad ?
that &apos;s a first .
they &apos;re getting desperate .
our registration numbers are trending upward .
because the population keeps growing ,
and no one here ever graduates .
actually , our numbers are up
because of improvements frankie &apos;s made .
those improvements ,
were only possible through your hard work , annie .
oh , get a boardroom .
interesting .
when were you gonna hear the whole truth about this ,
and not just the parts that suit you ?
what ?
ps i was glad to hear brenda &apos;s doing better .
just because city college is scared ,
doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re not dangerous .
is there anything in particular they could smear us with ?
nothing in particular ,
just overlapping clouds of many thousands and thousands of things .
let &apos;s not forget the brenda factor .
there isn &apos;t a brenda factor .
he says she &apos;s doing better .
better than what ?
her thyroid condition !
can you focus ?
can brenda ?
probably more so , now .
okay , we need to see this ad before it airs .
i &apos;m working on getting us a copy .
i have friends in the av department at city college .
ooh la la .
the brotherhood of av exists beyond your petty factionalism .
we serve only video , the one true queen ,
and her faithful consort , audio .
oh , could you guys be bigger nerds ?
no , most of us have achieved our maximum potential .
well , annie &apos;s right . we do have a situation here ,
so we will make this our situation room .
yes .
we need whiteboards , corkboards , laptops .
a bunch of clocks with different times on them , a red phone ,
a big tabletop map with little nazi tanks ,
and , or a godzilla .
the ad airs at 7am .
that means we have four hours and 13 minutes ,
to figure out what they &apos;re throwing at us and how to respond .
you know , it &apos;s the darndest thing ,
i think britta somehow crapped in my pants too .
uh @-@ huh , better head home .
jeff , you can &apos;t just leave a situation room .
it &apos;s only a situation room , because she called it that .
i mean i could declare it a .
cookie room !
there are no cookies .
there is a situation .
you guys , where &apos;s the greendale spirit !
where &apos;s the pride ?
i &apos;m fine .
found it .
she was wandering around campus , without pants .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
situation room .
what &apos;s the situation ?
brenda &apos;s got a bad thyroid .
i &apos;m sorry to hear that .
you can keep the pants .
i &apos;m going back to bed .
i &apos;m going with him .
i &apos;m gonna watch .
got it .
downloading it now .
you work hard to earn your degree ,
and your school should work hard to make that degree valuable .
so , why is greendale community college giving degrees to dogs ?
in 2001 , a staffordshire terrier mix named ruffles
took up residence on greendale &apos;s campus .
by 2008 , ruffles had earned a bachelor &apos;s degree .
not a two year degree , a four year degree .
where will you get your degree ?
if the answer is greendale ,
prepare to get boned .
paid for by city college , license 264392 .
did we give a degree to a dog ?
oh my god ! oh my god !
okay , it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s all right .
so , this is greendale , not city college ?
i &apos;m gonna get more pants .
they &apos;ve been calling me in to do more stuff lately .
it &apos;s pretty exciting .
well trust me , we &apos;ll be lucky if we get in three words before .
the first step is to pull our facts .
the most important one being , dean pelton .
did greendale community college give a degree to a dog ?
i seem to recall , no .
no way . there &apos;s absolutely no way .
not that dog .
that dog ?
you remember the dog .
was it enrolled in classes ?
how are these hard questions ?
why , are these the questions you &apos;re asking ?
you don &apos;t wanna know , if a dog got a degree here ?
it &apos;s not important .
what i wanna know is , did a dog get a degree here ,
in any way that can be proven ?
ooh , i like that , jeffrey .
i don &apos;t like that !
i like the truth .
play lawyer on your own time .
this is my own time .
you wanna be invested ?
well , this dump cuts my paychecks ,
and i &apos;ve got three hours to defend it .
so , how many seconds of that should i waste on truth ,
which is an artificial construct
that rarely holds up in court ,
and has never changed the outcome of a fight .
i &apos;m sorry you have to see him like this .
well , he is right about one thing ,
if city college can &apos;t support their claim ,
it &apos;s libel , we can have the station pull the ad ,
but that is precisely why the truth does matter .
the brenda paradox .
i found the dog .
i also found a lot of people &apos;s social security numbers .
you know , this incident &apos;s gone to far .
yeah .
this says she &apos;s registered as a border terrier .
they said staffordshire in the commercial .
isn &apos;t that something ?
i mean we &apos;ve known this animal 30 seconds
and she &apos;s already unreliable .
who is the real ruffles ?
i &apos;m sorry .
our strategy is to go after the dog ?
our strategy is denial ,
which includes discrediting the source .
abed , can you make one of those attack ads ?
jeff wants me to make me an attack ad .
so , why is he a pedophile ?
just demonstrating the formula .
you can refine your technique as you go .
i wanna know everything about this ruffles ,
she thinks she went to this school , fine .
but , maybe she thinks cat turds are delicious .
and maybe she barks just a little bit more , at black mailmen .
and she &apos;s spayed now ,
but how many puppies are out there ?
if you do this , we &apos;re no better than city college .
we &apos;ve never been better than city college .
we gave a degree to a dog .
allegedly . this conversation is privileged .
i could do a banksy style stencil of a dog ,
and spray paint it all over a school .
that sounds great !
but first , why don &apos;t you go get a bunch of coffee ,
drink all of it , then go get some more and bring it back here .
i actually love that idea .
i &apos;ll go with her .
she &apos;s wearing my pants .
i know this is crazy ,
but i &apos;m gonna check the school records to see if ,
you know , we gave a degree to a dog .
we didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s good .
you guys go find that truth you love so much .
if it &apos;s the kind . kind we can use , bring it back .
if not , you know , stuff gets lost .
no . no . bad !
we are better than city college .
we always have been .
which is why i know , that we did not give a degree to a dog .
i say we fight fire with fire .
city college try to embarrass us ?
we should embarrass them , right ?
right .
i say i go to city college with a camera ,
shoot a really gross porno movie
on their campus and put it online .
fine .
cool .
wait , what ?
it &apos;s very inspiring to watch you work .
you are inspiring , too .
in what way ?
i need olives , can you bring me olives ?
not again .
you did this a month ago .
then i brought them to you , and you acted like you hated them .
it &apos;s only my style to be secret ,
please bring me five can of olive .
five cans ?
but don &apos;t believe me if i say i don &apos;t like .
i &apos;m just pretending i hate olives .
honestly ? i couldn &apos;t care less
if they gave a dog a degree .
me neither .
in fact , i kinda hope they did .
well , why is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
they all treat me like i &apos;m a joke .
but if a dog got a degree ,
that means we &apos;re all a joke .
natalie is freezing ?
you know them ?
yeah of course i know them . but how do you ?
you &apos;re ...
black ?
no . old .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i just meant that ,
when i was into them i was like 15 .
i was like 40 .
i never really listened to music , when i was growing up .
i was in my own world ,
but one day at work , i heard this sound .
it was pillar of garbage .
oh , that is their best song .
best song .
i &apos;ve got it right here .
would you play it ?
yeah .
* moonlight , bleeding glass and healing needles , *
* amputated hearts are never whole . *
* too bright . *
* dreaming as the screaming seagulls *
* feed on parts of me i keep below , oh , oh , *
* orion , take off your belt *
* and let me go where you &apos;ve been . *
* i &apos;m flying overhead the buffalo are falling dead inside . *
you know , you know what ?
you know , those guys are going to need coffee
if they &apos;re going to keep that dog from having a degree .
there are things at , at stake here .
i , i get that now .
i found the smell .
someone filed a taco .
things that will otherwise get filed straight to my thighs .
so i know you agree with me that we need to find the truth , but ...
do you agree that the truth won &apos;t be horrible ?
i &apos;m not psychic , annie ,
that &apos;s an illusion caused by extreme preparedness .
but , what do you hope is true ?
oh god no , i never hope .
hope is pouting in advance .
hope is faith &apos;s richer , bitchier sister .
hope is the deformed addict bound incest
monster offspring of entitlement and fear .
my life results tripled the year i gave up hope
and every game on my phone that had anything to do with farming .
what &apos;s true will be true , annie .
our job is to deal with that truth .
you sound a little like jeff .
jeff said i sound like abed .
i wonder if britta thinks i sound like chang .
i assume change thinks i sound like
distant explosions and crying babies .
you know , he &apos;s unstable , right ?
yep .
oh , a transcript for ruffles .
you think that &apos;s our guy ?
i do .
oh my god .
so many classes .
see what hope does ?
screw you , frankie !
i &apos;m sorry , annie .
but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re seeing this for what it is .
it &apos;s a transcript for a dog .
a really , really long one !
it &apos;s proof that jeff was right .
this school has no value .
yeah , but this folder has no degree .
look .
what &apos;s that ?
victory .
you know , within the context of greendale .
would it be better if we- .
no .
never know until you try .
never know until i try .
what ?
i said we &apos;re quite a team .
here &apos;s the coffee .
let me know if there &apos;s anything else i can do to help .
we could use some fresh eyes on this cut .
we could ?
has anyone told you you &apos;re difficult to work with ?
everyone in your line of work .
this is ruffles .
she &apos;d like you to believe
she &apos;s a college graduate and a good girl .
but ruffles is anything , but- .
when ruffles moved into her neighborhood in 2007,
dead squirrels went up by 17 % .
coincidence ?
ask this bunny .
ruffles stole cookies from a girl scout ,
impersonated a lobster ,
has had 27 children with five different fathers ,
and , according to one local doctor , has worms .
ruffles might claim she doesn &apos;t .
ruffles claims a lot of things ,
maybe that &apos;s why ruffles once spent time on death row .
ruffles , not a lobster ,
not a student , not a good dog .
paid for by humanity versus ruffles .
i originally wanted the voice over to be
a james roll jones impersonator ,
but the james bater impersonator turned out pretty good .
i do wish he &apos;d leave , though .
you really let that dog have it .
yeah .
which i , i realize , is important now .
is it okay if i crash on- .
yeah .
yes .
what are you doing ?
nothing at all .
i wouldn &apos;t say that .
you just put five huge cans of olives next to me .
just something i felt like doing .
this isn &apos;t the first time you &apos;ve done this .
i &apos;m really confused by this .
is it code for something ?
i don &apos;t know .
and i don &apos;t care .
jackpot , relative to greendale .
my god , look at the course load , this dog was an animal .
most of them were attendance based .
how is this good news ?
unpaid library fees , 15 dollars ,
diploma withheld until payment remitted .
no degree , the commercial &apos;s a lie .
i &apos;m gonna call the station right now and have them pull the ad .
eat crap ruffles , and not just your own .
guys , let it go .
what are you talking about ?
the sad truth is that a dog can get a degree here .
yeah , but the happy truth is none did .
there &apos;s a difference between truth and honesty .
library dues ?
who cares !
ruffles put the work in relative to greendale .
that city college ad may be technically a lie ,
but it &apos;s really dishonest to kill it on a technicality .
and dragging this dog &apos;s name through the mud ?
that &apos;s worse than dishonest .
that &apos;s evil !
evil ?
i &apos;ll cop to silly .
somethings are silly and evil , like candy cigarettes .
and remember when flava flav had that reality show ?
i don &apos;t own a tv .
honestly , i think the most honest thing we can do right now .
the only thing that will make us better then city college ,
is to let that ad run and take our lumps .
annie , this started with me sleeping
and getting yelled at for not helping .
if it ends with you yelling at me for not sleeping ,
that &apos;s not a story , that &apos;s a german art film .
let , let it go .
i am a female student being physically
overpowered by a male teacher .
damn it !
britta , get her .
frankie , get her !
annie , sweetie , think about this practically .
if being better than city college means
letting them destroy us then what is the point ?
if surviving means being like them , what &apos;s the point ?
why not let one school die ,
and enroll at the one where my grades matter .
if those are your terms .
if the price of that transcript is you transferring ?
we accept .
personally , i hope you &apos;re bluffing .
yeah , well , here &apos;s what hope gets you .
hope and $ 1.49 will get you a candy bar .
buck 79 .
are you serious ? jesus !
have fun with your lying , cheating ,
dog smearing ,
truth blurring , trouser swapping school .
i don &apos;t remember when candy bars were 50 cents .
if someone says , hey , i just joined mensa .
or i consider myself a postmodern this or that .
you could say yeah , that and $ .50 could get you a candy bar ,
or that and a quarter could get you a phone call .
it was easy to be unimpressed back then .
i mean it was , literally , cheaper .
all right , we &apos;re kinda bummed out right now .
annie just left .
were you guys close ?
abed , i don &apos;t wanna talk right now .
okay .
i.
just so you know , the greendale ad
is gonna go up any time now .
i thought you might want to see it .
you know i don &apos;t to be a part of that .
just trust me .
this is ruffles .
ruffles was a student at greendale community college ,
she came really close to getting a degree ,
which means two things .
she &apos;s an exceptional dog ,
and greendale really needs to get its together .
we &apos;re working on it .
we &apos;re working hard .
and the good news is , when you work hard at greendale ,
no matter who or what you are , it pays off .
right , ruffles ?
jesus .
greendale community college .
you &apos;re already accepted .
you guys i knew you wouldn &apos;t do that to ruffles .
you hoped .
i hoped and it worked .
hope points .
hope points .
you do understand that what we did ,
was also just the most prudent tactical move ,
getting in front of the scandal letterman style .
yes jeff don &apos;t worry .
i promise i &apos;ll never mistake you for having a heart .
thank you .
kiss city college goodbye .
i did it .
did what ?
that stuff we talked about .
who are you ?
i &apos;m the plumber ?
why ?
here &apos;s why !
oh , god .
this is pornography ?
doy .
you &apos;re the only actor .
so ?
what kind of lens is this ?
who cares ?
you might be a genius .
why did you do this ?
what parent is going to let their kid go to a school
if a porn got shot there ?
but you shot in front of a plaster wall that could be anywhere .
and you &apos;re wearing your greendale t @-@ shirt .
okay genius , but the title is
chang does greendale , oh wait .
reshoots .
就仿佛看到了你真土舅舅的鬼魂一般
所有人都一个样
可能你把我看成是敌人
你就等着哭吧
铸就而成的钢铁都市
像我这样一个渺小的存在
the dean ?
hellos ?
are you in trouble ? is everything okay ?
is life hard everywhere ?
is everyone alone ?
all the time .
are you at home jeffrey ?
should i come over ?
you cannot come to me .
i must confession you .
i am not jeffrey .
i understand .
i rarely know who i am .
no , i mean i am not jeffrey .
let it out .
i am takashi . i am teenage boy in tokyo .
i think we all are sometimes .
i am sorry for making fun before , but now i need a friend .
why don &apos;t i bring you some olives tomorrow , jeffrey ?
i am not jeffrey !
i am not the dean !
i often think about that night .
such a small event , but ultimately the moment
that would lead me to becoming oyabun .
highest the leader of the yakuza .
did you get any of that ?
yahoo !
