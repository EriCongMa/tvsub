God, I thought it was you.
I heard "Grace" and I was like, "Oh, God."
Did you know her?
No. I-I mean, a little.
What happened?
Portia said she took a handful of her mom's sleeping pills.
No, she did it at the hotel
where she was supposed to go for the prom.
Why?
I think her boyfriend broke up with her or something.
They said she was in her underwear.
Hannah just tweeted
it was aspirin, not painkillers.
Did you guys see Connor just checked in on Foursquare,
like, an hour ago? At the library.
What are you doing at the library
the day after your girlfriend kills herself?
Ex-girlfriend. They broke up last week.
Did you see he changed his status to "Single"?
I know. She tweeted a picture of herself last week
after she dyed her hair red--
#YOLO.
Yeah, "You only live once."
She sat two rows behind me in algebra last year.
I know it's kind of morbid,
but I can't stop looking at her Facebook page.
And who is this?
Mr. Van Zanten.
And you shot him four times in the head?
Yes.
Why would you do that, Mr. Yates?
Because she wanted me to.
You're referring to the accused,
Gwyneth Van Zanten?
Yes.
You were her Pilates instructor?
Yes,
but she said she loved me.
If I shot her husband...
we would be together.
With his money?
Objection. Leading.
Sustained.
And you...
Strike that.
Why did M-Mrs. Van Zanten want you to shoot her husband?
Objection. Ambiguous.
Unfortunately, sustained.
O-One second.
Oh, did the accused offer you
anything in exchange for this murder?
Yes, she said we'd split his money.
And did Mrs. Van Zanten explain
why she wanted her husband killed?
He's a rich CEO. They had a prenup.
If she divorced him, she got nothing.
But if he died,
she got everything.
I see. And what happened after the murder?
Objection. Calls for narrative.
Ms. Hellinger,
you are now experiencing ASA Hazing 101.
Sustained.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Did you text the accused after the murder?
I did.
And what did your text say?
"It's done.
Our problems are over.
Don't go home until 8:00."
Why not go home until 8:00?
To establish her alibi.
Hello, this is the principal at Capstone Preparatory.
Over the weekend, there was a tragic incident
involving a Capstone student.
Please take a moment to discuss this...
Hey.
Hi.
A bit more rough and tumble than military court.
You'll be fine. Just don't retreat.
You're either advancing or retreating.
Hi, Mom.
My daughter.
No, thanks.
Grace. Uh, hi. What's going on?
I just got a call from school.
Oh, yeah. Grace Baskin OD'd on pills.
Oh, my God. When?
Last night.
We're all wearing yellow today.
It was her favorite color.
What happened?
Hey, Mom, I have to get to class.
Can I call you back?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I mean, it's sad, but I'm good.
I'll call you back, okay?
It's his fault.
I didn't even think he'd show up at school.
And, look, he didn't wear yellow.
I heard he told her to get an abortion.
No, he didn't.
She wasn't even pregnant.
Yeah, who told you she got an abortion?
I don't know. Someone re-tweeted it.
Is that even his car?
I thought he was a scholarship kid.
He is.
I've seen him on the bus.
Do you think he blames himself?
Wouldn't you? He breaks up with her,
then four days later, she kills herself.
I know.
Can you imagine?
My client has stated that she was faithful to her late husband
and that they were happily married.
Yet you claim she was having an affair with you?
Yes.
Do you have any proof of this?
Any love letters? Any...
mementos of this...
torrid affair?
No.
I see.
So we're to take your word for it?
And this text you sent her-- that it was "Done"--
what did she write back?
She didn't. We talked in person.
Ah. So...
you admitted killing her husband,
you admitted sending her a text admitting your guilt,
and my client hasn't admitted a thing?
Objection, Your Honor, counsel is testifying.
Yes, he is that.
Sustained.
After you sent this text,
my client immediately informed the police, didn't she?
Objection, your Honor. Counsel is still testifying.
Not only that, he's asking for hearsay.
It goes to the defendant's state of mind, Your Honor.
Actually, no. Mr. Gardner is asking
for the content of a conversation
between Mrs. Van Zanten and a police detective.
If that's what he wants,
he should put one of them on the stand.
Oh, she's got you there, Mr. Gardner.
Congratulations, Ms. Hellinger.
What were you offered in trade
for your testimony here, Mr. Yates?
Well, I wouldn't say it was a trade.
I received a plea bargain.
And what was the plea bargain?
20 years.
For cold-blooded murder?
Objection, Your Honor. Argumentative.
Yes. Sustained.
And what is the usual sentence for first-degree murder?
Objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation.
Yes. Sustained.
A murder like this usually draws a 45-year sentence...
Objection. Counsel is testifying.
Sustained again.
Are you having trouble getting out what you want, Mr. Gardner?
Nicely played.
Thank you.
We used to represent you.
Yep. Thank you.
Go well in court?
Everybody feels bad for the underdog.
What about the person who's supposed to do well?
No one talks about the pressure we're under.
So, what's up with you?
You've been away from work.
No.
Mentally, you have. What's going on?
Oh, just, uh, personal stuff.
Uninteresting.
Huh. Judge Creary.
What are you doing?
Going to the restroom.
Look, Creary plays by the book.
Then he doesn't have to talk.
Kalinda, this single case could drag us out of bankruptcy.
I want to get a sense of where we stand.
Oh, Will Gardner! How the hell are you?
Judge Creary.
No, uh, no, I'll call you right back.
Will, hello.
Giada, I... I didn't know you were in town.
Yeah, Orren & Polk, second year.
His Honor was just offering me some career advice.
Do you know this bastard?
I do. We met when I was at DePaul,
although we haven't spoken in a while.
What happened there?
I don't know, I thought it was you.
Oh, no, it wasn't me.
Yeah, well, I'd stay away from him.
He's a bad influence.
Oh, I knew that.
Will is a bad boy.
Disbarred bad boy.
Six-months- suspended bad boy.
You should've seen him in court today.
He was completely screwed up.
Really? I... thought we more than held our own.
No, you're gone, you're-you're cooked,
you're... deep-fried cooked.
Why is that?
Your client-- she's guilty.
How do you figure, Your Honor?
Actus reus.
You're trying to make her out to be a saint.
She was cheating on her husband.
No, I'm sorry, Your Honor, that's just not true.
I can't for the life of me figure why you wanted a bench trial.
Except you'd probably do worse with a jury.
His client is an ice queen.
Looks something like this.
I mean it.
Your Honor, if you believe that,
you need to recuse yourself.
Ooh! I love this one! With his ethics!
Love the ethics, Will.
Great for a disbarred lawyer.
Bribing judges and stealing.
You know, if it was up to me,
you wouldn't be allowed to practice law ever again.
Maybe the thing is to agree to disagree.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, young lady... for bringing my work here.
He didn't say that?
He said I bribed judges and stole,
our client is guilty, and I should never practice law again.
Well, he was drinking.
Which means he's only being more loose-lipped about
with what he really thinks.
Damn it.
Gwyn brings her husband's fortune to us,
it gets us out of debt.
I know, and it's a good case.
In front of another judge, we'd win.
What are you thinking, the same thing?
Move for a recusal?
He says no, you've turned the judge against you.
He's against me already.
There will be fallout from the judicial community.
Creary is beloved.
He was beloved.
Judges know he's a loose cannon.
We win this case, we get out from under the trustee.
We could get the 27th floor back.
Have Cary argue the motion for you.
No, Alicia.
Will...
It's not that.
I think Creary's got a thing for the ladies.
Oh. Well, don't embarrass him.
Ask for the conference in chambers.
Have Alicia move for the recusal there.
And if he says no?
This should be interesting.
Probably too late to take my advice back.
Probably.
Your Honor,
the defense requests an issues conference in chambers.
What do you need, Counselor?
We have a motion, Your Honor.
But it would be easier to present it in chambers.
Oh? And why is that?
Mr. Gardner?
It's a personal matter, Your Honor.
Oh, really, a personal matter?
What kind of personal matter?
Please, Your Honor.
Well, in chambers it'll be on the record,
Mr. Gardner, and-and...?
Alicia Florrick.
Ah, the state's attorney's wife.
Very fortuitous.
In there and in here, it'll be on the record,
so if you have a motion, let's hear it.
Your Honor, we move that you recuse yourself.
Oh, really?
Now, why should I recuse myself?
You have demonstrated bias against the defense.
Still licking your wounds about those objections yesterday,
Mr. Gardner?
No, Your Honor, this is regarding the biased comments
you made to Mr. Gardner
in the bar, The Arena, last night.
This is dangerous territory, Mrs. Florrick.
You called our client guilty,
and you said that Mr. Gardner was a known liar,
and that he should give up now because he would lose.
Well, your motion is denied.
You have any further witnesses?
Your Honor, you showed bias against us.
I have ruled on your motion, Mrs. Florrick.
You may sit down now unless you have another witness.
You've given us no alternative, Your Honor,
but to file a motion to substitute Your Honor for cause.
You what?!
We are filing for a substitution hearing.
Now, you sit down right now, Mrs. Florrick.
I have ruled!
And it is not up to you...
No, sir, it is not up to you.
You have no further witnesses,
then we will move toward...
Excuse me, Your Honor.
It is our right.
No, it is not your right to disrupt my court.
You're in contempt.
If I make a motion to substitute, Your Honor,
then it is no longer in your hands,
and you must transfer this matter to another judge.
You don't know what you've just done.
We do, Your Honor,
but you've given us no other choice.
Everybody has a choice. Everybody.
You're fishing for a mistrial here, and you won't get it.
You lose this motion,
and I'll be right back here to judge this case.
We understand that.
So I'll give you one last chance
to step back over that line.
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but my motion has been made.
We move for a hearing into your bias
against Mr. Gardner and our client.
Well, we're in it now.
We've been ten percent more successful
in optimizing campaign page keywords,
and that's resulted in a 20% increase in organic search traffic.
We've been employing the BLUF tactic of networking design.
That's Bottom Line Up Front.
I would say this met with mixed results.
Wait. There's been a 20% jump in fund-raising?
How did that happen?
Uh, I.T.'s been better managed.
By who?
One of the volunteers.
Hire him.
Her.
Do I care?
You're hired.
What?
Just keep doing what you're doing.
Good job, you guys, I'll need you to stay a little later.
You got it.
No problem.
Where are you going, Jay?
Uh, I have to get back home.
Okay. Tomorrow.
If I can.
All stand. Court is now in session.
The Honorable Peter Dunaway presiding.
Uh-oh.
What?
It's Judge Dunaway.
This is a hearing to determine whether Judge Harrison Creary
is prejudiced against the defendant and defense counsel...
...in People V. Gwyneth Van Zanten.
ASA Hellinger,
do you support Mr. Gardner's motion to substitute?
No, Your Honor.
The People do not believe
Judge Creary has shown bias in this case.
Then you will present the evidence against prejudice,
Mr. Gardner's representative will present the evidence for it.
This hearing is, in effect,
a trial within a trial...
Your Honor Creary, you don't need to be present at this hearing.
Are you here to testify?
Uh, no, Your Honor.
I don't want to give this...
mini-persecution any more attention than it needs.
But I do want to face my accusers.
Well, that is your right, Your Honor.
Uh, Judge Creary's prejudice will be this hearing's
one and only issue, rules of evidence will apply,
and my ruling will be final.
Is that understood by all counselors?
Yes, Your Honor.
Good. Then we will begin.
Hi.
I'm Grace.
Uh, sorry.
Uh, that's my real name.
Grace Florrick.
I'm really sorry about the other Grace.
What do you want?
Why aren't you in class?
Why aren't you?
'Cause I saw you come in here.
Look, I don't need anything, okay?
We broke up. It was a while ago.
She didn't do it 'cause of me.
You know, you really shouldn't smoke.
You're the politician's daughter,
the one caught with a hooker?
He wasn't caught with a hooker.
Class is in session. Who's in there?
Shh.
Come out now. Right now!
If you don't want to get in trouble,
come out right this minute!
They can't find us here.
I see you in there.
Do you need me to deal with this, huh?
All right. All right, bye.
Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Saverese.
Hey, no problem.
About your losing Tow Truck bid--
we can't sue Strickler Automotive,
but we can appeal on the basis of fraud.
But just to warn you,
they're probably going to say you cheated, too.
Well, I thought your company
was protecting me against all that crap.
Yeah. Unfortunately,
Strickler's proven quite litigious.
Now, there's a chance we may end up in deposition,
so I have to ask you a few questions.
You were convicted on a drug charge.
Cocaine. Intent to sell.
And how many years were you in?
Two. It was Canadians.
You know, they've got soft hearts.
And... you're not involved now in drugs?
What's that suit you're wearing?
Suit?
Oh, it's Calvin Klein. Why?
You need a lot of suits like that to work here, do you?
Yeah. Yeah, some.
But you don't wear suits like that when you're out and about?
I mean, on weekends, you don't wear suits like that, do you?
No.
Good, 'cause then people might think you're gay or something.
Oh... you're not gay, are you?
I'm sorry if...
Is something... the matter, Mr. Saverese?
What, like you being gay?
I don't mind gay people.
Why don't we take this up tomorrow?
Why? Did I offend you?
No. No, I just...
I think we should take this up tomorrow
when Alicia's back in the office.
Sure. Sure.
Yeah. I mean, why not pay for two lawyers, not just one?
Yeah, that's, uh...
That sounds good.
Okay.
I was walking to the bar's restroom
when I ran into Judge Creary.
Did you approach him?
No. I was walking past him, and he called me.
And what did you talk about?
He told me I was losing and that my client was guilty.
Actus reus.
A guilty act?
Yes. I told him he hadn't yet heard all the evidence,
and that's when he accused me of being a disbarred lawyer
and of bribing judges.
Objection. Your Honor,
if Judge Creary would like to testify, he is welcome,
but he should refrain from editorializing.
Excuse me. I think his Honor has shown great patience, young lady.
I know what you think, Your Honor.
Does that mean you overrule my objection?
The gallery should remain silent.
How did the conversation end
with Judge Creary, Mr. Gardner?
He told me, if it was up to him,
I would never practice law again.
Thank you, no further questions.
Hello, Mr. Gardner.
Hi, Counselor.
You say Judge Creary accused you of being a disbarred lawyer,
and that was untrue?
Yes, I was suspended for six months
but not permanently disbarred.
Congratulations.
Objection.
I'll withdraw that, Counselor.
Do you know what the first search result is
when you type "Will Gardner" into a Chumhum search engine?
That was a practical joke by an opponent.
Would you mind reading what it says there?
"Do you want 'Will Gardner Disbarred Lawyer'?"
But, again, this is a joke.
But you can understand why he might mistake you
for a disbarred lawyer.
The fact that I was arguing in his court might suggest otherwise.
But it's no secret you've had troubles this past year.
You were suspended for stealing money from a client.
Is that correct?
Yes, but I replaced it.
Judge Creary called you a thief and a liar.
Can you really say those characterizations are inaccurate?
Objection, Your Honor.
The question is whether or not Judge Creary showed bias
by making these comments,
not whether or not they were true.
Sustained.
Wow, that's some defense.
Our lawyer may be a thief and a liar,
but the judge really can't say it.
Objection.
Sustained.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'd like to call Judge Creary to the stand.
He's had a change of heart and would like to testify.
You've heard Mr. Gardner's accusations against you?
I have.
And did you, in fact, call him a thief?
No, I did not.
Did you offer your opinions on the current case?
I did not.
Oh, my God, you're lying.
Mr. Gardner,
you'll find yourself in contempt.
Do you know why Mr. Gardner would be accusing you of this?
Well, I can only guess that he had...
he had many objections sustained against him that day
and he thought I was biased.
But everything else he said about this...
bar encounter is a lie?
Yes.
We need to find a witness from the bar.
Hi.
Hi.
That was nice, getting a call.
I'm sorry, did I stop calling you or you stop calling me?
No, I called you-- you just didn't return.
Three times.
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm a jerk.
Mm, so... how much is this one worth? $80 a glass?
No, four dollars.
Things are tough in Spain these days.
Oh, of course.
How is the family fortune?
Reduced by 70%.
Ouch. Things are not great all over.
No.
I read about your firm.
And you.
Where are you going after this?
Where am I going?
I don't know. What about you?
I was gonna go home and read a briefing.
A big long brief about farm subsidies.
Sounds like a Thursday night.
Light some candles, run a bath,
read about the viability of ethanol as a fuel supplement.
How viable is it?
Pretty damn viable.
More so than you might think.
That's not bad for four dollars.
Oh, I lied-- it's Dominio de Pingus.
It's $180 a glass.
I'll count pennies tomorrow.
Why aren't you reading your e-mails?
I sent you three e-mails today.
I am reading my e-mails.
Just not mine?
Well, I always know when it's important,
you'll seek me out, and...
here you are.
Uh... that one... that one there.
Click on it.
And now the attachment. Click on it.
Have you been hanging around schools, Eli?
It's not ours.
This is a tracker from the other side.
That always sounds so sci-fi.
Eli...
It's the other campaign.
They're looking for vulnerabilities.
She was followed to school?
This campaign has become about family values.
Kresteva has a kid with leukemia--
he wants to make it seem
that you have a smoker who cuts class.
What is going on with my life?
Where are you? We need you over here.
Appreciate the opportunity...
It's not about the opportunity.
The campaign needs you, Jay.
Things are falling apart here, and they're getting angry at me.
I can't work full-time.
What about after school?
Did you see anyone follow you to school?
No.
I don't know.
I'll call you again.
Hey, n-n-no...
This is so creepy.
I was sitting on a bench talking to a friend.
What's wrong with that?
Who's the friend?
Connor.
Who's Connor?
A boy.
Grace...
I'm not smoking.
I know. I didn't say you were.
These trackers...
they will find any opportunity
to paint you in a negative light, Grace.
I know. Is that it?
Mom...
Zach, could you give us a second?
The girl who...
committed suicide--
Why?
Why did she do it?
I don't know.
She was cutting.
She w...
Cutting herself?
It's not that weird; a lot of girls do it.
Cut themselves? Why?
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
Self-hatred?
I... I think it feels good to heal.
You would tell me if there's anything wrong?
I'm not cutting, Mom.
I know.
It doesn't have to be that.
I just...
I love you, Grace.
I love you, too.
I know.
You're a good girl.
So, what do you need, Will?
What do I need? Why do you think I need anything?
That look on your face.
You're beautiful.
Oh, yeah?
The other night with Judge Creary...
What?
No, I thought it was that.
He denied it. It's my word against his.
You were there.
So that's why you're here?
No.
But it wouldn't hurt.
This is why I am not gonna do it.
Do what?
Testify for you.
Creary was just showing off for me
and giving you a hard time 'cause we dated.
And you're the one who blew it out of proportion.
He said my client was guilty.
People say a lot of things.
You said that you returned my phone call.
So this is about not returning your calls?
No, this is about not seeing the upside of crossing a judge.
The upside is: it's the truth.
And that's your real goal here?
The truth.
We could subpoena you.
Yeah, you could.
Whoa. Cary Agos.
What, you come to tell us how the other half lives?
Still a $200 buy-in?
I don't know-- might be time to raise it.
So, you happy to be back at your old firm?
Ah, Gardner-- he's got it out for me.
Yeah? Man, he's got it out for everyone.
Oh, yeah, your boss, he must be pissed.
You still clerking with Creary?
Yeah. He is not happy.
But, well, he hasn't been happy for a while.
Oh, yeah? Why is that, the double shifts?
No, his wife.
Well, I guess his ex-wife.
Is it fair to consider you a reluctant witness here, Mr. Chapin?
It is fair to consider me both reluctant and really pissed.
Because you've been subpoenaed?
Yes.
And because I thought I was talking to a friend.
Now, you are Judge Creary's law clerk?
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.
Don't worry.
After Will Gardner's suspension,
what did you observe Judge Creary saying about Mr. Gardner?
He called Mr. Gardner a liar and a thief.
And these are the same words that Judge Creary
denied speaking in their recent bar encounter?
Objection, Your Honor.
Sustained.
To your knowledge,
Mr. Chapin, is Judge Creary the only judge in Cook County
who made derogatory comments about Will during his suspension?
No. Everyone was talking about it.
And all the judges were joking about it, too.
Which judges in particular do you recall made comments?
Paver, um...
Worth... Ferraro...
Judge John Ferraro?
Didn't he recently rule in favor of Will Gardner
on a vehicular manslaughter suit?
I believe so.
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
It's relevant because it proves
a judge is fully capable of putting personal feelings
about defense counsel aside when deciding a case.
I quite agree.
Overruled.
We need to move off of the personal animus strategy.
The key is his prejudging our client's guilt.
Well, what about the witness at the bar?
She won't testify.
Can't we subpoena her?
I'm not sure she'll tell the truth.
What else did your friend say about Creary?
You mean my ex-friend?
Well, since Creary's divorce, he's been struggling with alcohol.
Going to AA?
Yes. Why?
Are we sure we want to go there?
I don't know.
If you go nuclear, don't leave missiles in your silo.
So, are you gonna go to the funeral?
You should go to the funeral.
Why are you so interested in her?
What do you mean? I'm not interested in her.
All you want to do is talk about her.
I don't know.
I just feel bad.
I thought you didn't know her.
I know, but I could still feel bad.
It's just weird.
Her being dead.
It's not weird.
Do you believe in God?
No.
Why not?
Why is that funny to you?
You're funny.
Girls don't come here to... talk about God.
They come in here to have sex?
Is that what she did?
The other Grace?
Uh-huh.
We're not gonna have sex.
I didn't ask you.
You're right.
No.
So that's it?
I'm late to class.
Tomorrow?
Yeah?
Oh, hi.
No, no, that's good.
Do you mind looking into Judge Creary's drinking?
Okay. Everything okay?
Yeah, my daughter's two steps away from dating Keith Moon,
but everything's fine.
Look, if you want to go out for a drink or
you want to speak, just give me a call, all right,
and I'll get onto that.
All right, take care.
Who's that?
Work.
The place where I work.
Was it Cary?
It wasn't Cary.
You need to give it a rest on the whole alpha male thing.
I don't understand.
How can we take a ten percent dive in I.T.?
We were in the middle of a reorganization,
and we've hit a bump.
What bump?
I lost my volunteers.
Well, get new ones.
No, there was one I needed.
And what happened?
He's in school.
He can't work anymore.
Are you insane?
He's in school and he can't work anymore?
You tell him he has to work.
He's new. He's not very committed...
Okay, shut up.
Is he here?
Where?
Jay, this is Eli Gold.
Jay is a new volunteer.
Where are you going?
No, kid, you're staying.
Mr. Gold would like to offer you a job.
No, let him go.
Damn it.
Are you pacing me?
Another round, please.
Two more beers? Sure.
Want me to get her number for you?
Do you ever get jealous?
Do I get jealous? Yeah, why?
Of who?
I don't know.
People I'm dating.
When they meet someone else.
I'm narcissistic enough to think
women should give up sex altogether after me.
You jealous of someone?
How do you stop being jealous?
You stop caring.
Start seeing other people.
Like anything, it wears off after a while.
Yeah.
Or... you tell the person,
"I don't want you to see other people."
But then you have to be ready to back it up.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
That's a very genuine "Thank you" from you.
I have to go to an AA meeting now.
Hi, thank you.
Welcome.
Hello. Welcome.
Hi.
Oh, is this your first time?
At this meeting, yeah.
I usually go to the one across town.
That's great. Well, welcome.
Thank you.
Actually, I'm looking for a friend of mine, Harrison.
Do you know if he's coming tonight?
I don't. He's usually here by now.
He's doing well, isn't he?
Thank you, Mrs. Vaughn.
Do you attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings
with Judge Harrison Creary?
Mrs. Vaughn?
I do.
What does the judge share with the group at these meetings?
Your Honor, this is truly outrageous.
Alcoholics Anonymous has a strict code of confidentiality.
Yes, Counselor, unfortunately, AA is not covered
by client, patient, or clergy privileges,
and answers can be compelled here.
I don't agree with this, but the law is the law.
Again, what has the judge shared at these meetings, ma'am?
He recently returned to addiction when his wife left him.
This is cruel.
And did he say what happened when he drank?
He blacked out.
Therefore, if Judge Creary had indeed prejudged
Mrs. Van Zanten for-- what did he call it?-- her actus reus--
and if he said as much to Mr. Gardner at the bar,
then due to his blackouts, he might not remember it now?
Ms. Hellinger, aren't you going to object?
Am I going to...?
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.
Sustained. Leading.
No further questions, Your Honor.
I'll keep this short and sweet.
You want to work for your dad's campaign, I won't stop you.
But I can't speak for your mother.
Now, if you want some advice
as to how to present it to your mother, I would offer it.
Who's that?
Connor.
Who's Connor?
Grace's friend.
Grace.
Mr. Gold.
About my mom.
Yes, yes, the best way to present it to your mom
is that you're becoming a part of the campaign anyway.
You don't want to hate yourself by making your dad lose
when there's a chance you could help your dad win.
Okay.
Best not to say I was here.
You weren't here.
I am ready to rule.
This trial has been, above all, angering.
I believe the defense-- the ostensible defense--
at the moment it seems to be the prosecution--
they have resorted to rank character assassination.
They have inflicted on Judge Harrison Creary a personal examination
that none of us could survive.
They...
They have dug through his confessions.
They have subpoenaed innocent bystanders
and forced them to testify.
I am, to be frank, disgusted.
Your Honor...
No, sit down.
Unfortunately I believe the defense has proven its case.
I have doubts about Judge Creary's memory
of the evening in question.
To be factually correct does not mean to be right.
Therefore, I am granting the defense's motion to substitute.
This case will be assigned to a new judge.
Next time in front of a jury.
I think you'll want to consider taking a plea first-- 25 years?
And why would we do that?
Because your client was cheating on her husband.
No.
Actus reus--
it's not just Latin for "Guilty act."
It's an online forum for cheating spouses.
That's why Judge Creary said "Actus reus."
Before his divorce he visited the forum.
That's when he saw your client's profile.
Still doesn't mean she killed him.
You're right, but we're checking the Actus Reus logs,
and my guess is, we'll find somebody else
your client solicited to murder her husband.
Or you can take the 25 years.
You know I share an office now.
So?
So I don't think Cary would appreciate
you sitting at his desk.
I've just gotten word that the trackers are following Zach, too.
Yeah, we knew that.
Yes.
I just wanted to let you know
that they're involving your children in the campaign.
I knew that, too.
I thought you might consider allowing them to be interviewed.
No.
If Peter loses, you don't want your kids to blame themselves.
Eli, I'm tired.
Please just go.
Okay.
Can't say I didn't try.
I won't.
Oh. Hey, I'm sorry, buddy.
Are you all right?
I hope I didn't ruin your suit.
Hey, sorry, sorry.
Sorry about that.
Hey, let, let me help you up.
What is that, Calvin Klein?
Hello.
I want to help with Dad's campaign.
Okay, let's talk.
I can help,
and Grace and I are already part of the campaign
whether we want to be involved or not.
I don't want to be part of the problem,
I want to be part of the solution.
And how do you become part of the solution?
By helping at the campaign office.
I'd work on their computers after school.
It's only a 30-minute drive, and I'd go straight there.
And you'd only work in the campaign office?
Yes, Mom,
and I'd still do my homework afterwards,
everything, I promise.
Should I come back?
No, we're fine.
Okay, I'll think about it.
Okay.
You will?
I will.
What was that about?
You smell like cigarette smoke.
It's not me.
