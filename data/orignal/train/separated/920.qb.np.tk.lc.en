growing up , my brother barry
had a favorite shirt he couldn &apos;t live without .
it logged nearly 7,000 hours on his body
and took part in over 2,000 loads of laundry .
he even gave it a name -- big orange .
by mom , off to school .
back it up .
it &apos;s picture day for the yearbook .
you &apos;re not wearing that shirt .
the creamsicle orange really makes me pop off the page .
no . no way .
you wear that thing all the time .
just look at these pictures from last year .
wrestling team -- orange shirt .
beatboxing club -- orange shirt .
nunchucking society -- orange shirt .
don &apos;t forget zombie survival club .
colleges are gonna snap me up .
you know what the coolest club is ?
the handsome oxford button down club !
look at me and know this .
i will never take off big orange .
i will get married in this shirt .
i will win the super bowl in this shirt .
i will become president of the united states of america
in this shirt .
well , then i &apos;m not gonna come to your inauguration .
who am i kidding ? of course i &apos;ll be there .
and i &apos;ll iron that shirt .
and as bad as it was for my mom ,
it was even worse for his girlfriend lainey .
happy anniversary , babe !
dude , i spent hours on my make @-@ up , fixing my hair ,
and squeezing into this dress .
i &apos;m so lucky i &apos;m a boy .
i woke up like this .
i was wearing this shirt and everything .
lainey always looked at my mom as a surrogate smother ,
but nothing bonded them more than one thing .
god , i hate that shirt .
he looks like a walking circus peanut .
he looks like an angry cheez @-@ it .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m dating a glass of tang .
once , when he was wearing it , a panhandler gave him change .
i had a dream i married it
and we had little orange shirt babies .
i wish i could get him to ditch it once and for all ,
but he won &apos;t listen to me .
or me .
wait .
what about us .
us ?
separately , we can &apos;t control him ,
but together , we can join forces and destroy him !
with love .
i like where this is going .
we hit him hard and fast .
let &apos;s juice this orange .
babe . we &apos;re gonna take you to the mall and buy a new shirt .
already got one . thanks .
really think you should let us take you shopping , schmoo .
mm , maybe some other time .
and so the mother @-@ girlfriend onslaught began .
my mom and lainey spent the next 10 minutes laying down
the most intense guilt trip our family had ever seen .
all i know is i &apos;ll probably just die brokenhearted .
if that &apos;s the truth , then why don &apos;t you trust me ?
do you not love me ?
okay .
great !
wonderful .
what just happened ?
i think you &apos;re going shopping for a new shirt , kiddo .
i really don &apos;t need one . this one &apos;s great .
oh , shoot .
it was may 11 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and i was climbing the ladder to my treehouse .
it was my sanctuary , the place i felt most safe --
balls !
that &apos;s it . this treehouse is coming down .
your mother told me to tear that thing immediately two years ago .
i was hoping it would rot from the tree , but no such luck .
no ! you can &apos;t just destroy a piece of our childhood .
trash it . it blocks my rays during peak sun .
peak sun ! there you go .
no . don &apos;t listen to her .
that &apos;s my fortress of solitude .
can you please dismantle adam &apos;s fortress of dorkitude now ?
i would love to get a good base before pool @-@ party season starts .
i &apos;m gonna get my sledgehammer .
never !
damn it . where are you going ?
the only way to get me down is if you remove me yourself !
please don &apos;t do this .
that treehouse means everything to me .
why is this the one time you &apos;re not giving in to your laziness ?
because i just had my morning nap .
erica , help me out here . dad &apos;s threatening to be handy .
talk some sense into him !
what about your experience with me makes you think
i &apos;m gonna care about this conversation at all ?
how can you say that ?
don &apos;t you remember all the awesome stuff
we used to do up there ?
sleepovers , stargazing ,
the bottle @-@ rocket wars , the goldberg gang .
no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
don &apos;t you ?
maybe the case of the missing skeletor will jog your memory .
two days ago , our detective agency got a lead
on a missing skeletor action figure .
the details of the case reside in this dossier .
back in the day , kid crime solvers were all the rage .
nancy drew inspired us to form our own detective agency
with a completely original name ...
goldberg gang here .
... or not .
after examining all our clues ,
our evidence leads us to this spot .
dad ? we need to see what &apos;s under you .
i told you i don &apos;t have your stupid toy , now stop aggriv--
looks like goldberg gang is gonna have to set up
one of those stealthy , intricate traps .
dad , there &apos;s pizza in the kitchen .
what ?
yes ! case closed ! to the treehouse !
okay , stop ! i remember the stupid goldberg gang .
now erase the tape so i can go back to forgetting it .
oh , come on . can &apos;t we do one last case
before the treehouse goes ? just like the old days ?
oh , look ! lucky &apos;s missing !
it &apos;s the case of the missing --
damn it . she &apos;s right there .
as i was hoping to reunite the goldberg gang ,
lainey and my mom were desperate
to rid barry of his trusty shirt .
i can &apos;t wait for you to try these on .
you &apos;re gonna be the handsomest boy in the whole world .
but you said i &apos;m already
the handsomest boy in the whole world .
now you can break your own record !
just like wayne gretzky !
the great one ? yes !
distracting him with hockey people -- you &apos;re good .
i learned from the best .
that day ,
lainey and my mom manipulated barry
into the most epic
trying @-@ on @-@ clothes montage
that the &apos; 80s had ever seen .
it started out fun , colorful , and somewhat stylish ...
but after two grueling hours
and an ungodly amount of acid @-@ washed denim ...
... it became just plain ugly .
he looks so cute !
we fixed him .
you sure about this ?
baby , i &apos;m telling you , you look hot .
richard grieco hot .
looks like big orange &apos;s reign of terror is finally over !
yeah , it wasn &apos;t .
um , what is happening right now ?
what the ?
you have a closet full of new clothes .
why is that back on your body ?
i got an algebra quiz i &apos;m not gonna study for ,
so i need my lucky shirt .
oh , and thursday is naked rob &apos;s birthday .
he expects me to dress up .
and friday is big orange friday .
got to wear big orange .
it &apos;s back and more disgusting than ever .
how did it not work ?
god , i just wish that shirt could disappear .
couldn &apos;t it ?
what are you saying ?
accidents happen all the time .
look ...
i &apos;m not saying we shouldn &apos;t do what you &apos;re suggesting right now ,
but if there was an accident --
clothes are very fragile .
it &apos;s really got to look like one --
if it were to happen .
which it won &apos;t .
unless it does .
ooh , duran duran is playing downtown this weekend .
want to go ?
can &apos;t . it &apos;s my stepdad &apos;s last day
before he turns himself in .
boom ! dryer &apos;s done .
come to papa , big orange .
let those awesome threads magnify this awesome bod .
what the hell ?
i could &apos;ve sworn i ...
no .
no , no , no , no , no !
and in that moment , my brother barry
came face @-@ to @-@ face with the greatest tragedy of his young life .
stay with me , big orange .
it &apos;s not as bad as it looks .
the colors are draining from him !
you got to fight .
come on , buddy ! stay with me !
want me to tell him it &apos;s just a shirt ?
don &apos;t just sit there . do something !
what do you want me to do ?
call 911 .
tell them there &apos;s an emergency ,
but don &apos;t get into details .
hurry !
tell them to put a shirt doctor in the ambulance .
god , why do bad things happen to good t @-@ shirts ?
i don &apos;t know . mom made a mistake ?
mom never makes laundry mistakes .
someone &apos;s out to get me !
a third party did this on purpose !
well , it &apos;s done . just cleaned out the treehouse .
the goldberg gang is officially out of business .
no . not yet !
there &apos;s one more case i need them to solve .
there &apos;s been a murder --
a shirt murder .
this has my stepdad written all over it .
to the treehouse !
even though big orange was gone ,
barry refused to rest until the culprit was found .
we know you could &apos;ve taken this case to anyone ,
so we appreciate you coming to us .
yeah . this is dumb , so i &apos;m gonna go .
no ! wait ! you guys got to help me find out who did this .
big orange &apos;s spirit will not rest until the perpetrator
has been found and paid his debt .
and what &apos;s in it for us ?
you mean besides the justice served ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna need something real .
i &apos;ll also pay you $ 7,000 .
um , yeah ! no @-@ brainer .
it &apos;s my bar mitzvah money .
i &apos;ve been saving it up for a moment exactly like this .
for when someone destroyed your $ 10 t @-@ shirt ?
don &apos;t you want to save it for a trip to europe
or a down @-@ payment on a h--
don &apos;t answer that .
the goldberg gang is on the case .
yes !
you know the drill , erica .
to the treehouse !
that means frantically run to the backyard and start the case .
you know , to the treehouse !
fine , but we &apos;re walking at a regular pace .
to the treehouse !
at long last , the goldberg gang was back on the beat !
but before we could catch the culprit ,
we first had to go over the usual suspects .
okay . this investigation is officially open .
it was mom .
too obvious !
we need to think outside the box .
it was mom .
figure out who has the means ...
opportunity ...
and motive .
which spells &quot; mom . &quot;
coincidence ! fortunately for us ,
i &apos;ve narrowed it down to only 36 suspects .
suspect number one -- pops .
put a few martinis in him , he &apos;s capable of anything .
it was mom .
suspect number two -- me .
am i guilty ? probably not , but i do sleepwalk .
it was mom .
suspect number three !
what is that ?
a ghost -- classic &quot; scooby doo &quot; villain .
again , it was mom .
this is not a mystery , we &apos;re not detectives ,
and this is not our headquarters .
what are you guys doing up here ?
i told you i &apos;m tearing this down .
you can &apos;t . not now . this case is heating up , man .
enough with the case !
i don &apos;t want you out there ,
running around like a loose cannon ,
because it &apos;s my ass on the line , and i won &apos;t have it !
i got to find the truth !
it &apos;s gotten too personal . you &apos;re off the case .
give me your magnifying glass and your hat .
you can &apos;t shut us down , old man !
me and my partner will not rest till
we track down and interrogate every single option .
and so our intense search began .
it was you .
me ? please .
you know how much i respect laundry .
my record &apos;s impeccable .
well , maybe it wasn &apos;t an accident .
what are you saying ?
you &apos;ve always had it out for that shirt .
looks like you finally pulled the trigger .
or it &apos;s not one person at all .
maybe a crime this complex is a two @-@ man job .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , nerd boy !
i mean , don &apos;t interrupt your sister .
you know , manners and stuff .
i know that you &apos;re guilty , and eventually , you &apos;ll crack .
until then , we will follow every lead and not stop until --
where &apos;d she go ?
to the treehouse !
this is bad . real bad !
they &apos;re closing in on us .
hold it together . they got nothing .
there &apos;s bleach on my hands .
just remember , this was for barry &apos;s own good .
so you keep your pretty little mouth shut !
looking good , snuggy boo .
how do the new threads feel ?
i look like a foreigner .
a handsome , stylish foreigner .
like a super hot balki bartokomous .
i miss my old shirt .
i don &apos;t know who i am anymore .
am i big or tasty ? no one knows !
what have we done ?
when he finds out , it &apos;s all over .
well , he &apos;s not gonna find out .
ya dig ?
i dig .
repeat after me --
&quot; i am rock solid . &quot;
i am rock solid .
it was your mom and i. we &apos;re , like , totally guilty .
i have one question . who are you covering for ?
what ? no one . i literally just confessed .
well , isn &apos;t that convenient ?
typical patsy taking the fall for a network
of criminals above you .
why is he talking like that ? i , like , literally confessed .
it &apos;s pathetic .
he &apos;s stretching out the whole goldberg gang thing
as long as he can .
just ignore him .
look , you got to drop it .
if barry finds out what i did , he &apos;ll never forgive me .
fine . your secret &apos;s safe with me .
i &apos;ll save your implausible relationship with my brother .
you can &apos;t ignore the facts ! this conspiracy runs deep .
i &apos;ll bring the real culprits to justice . you &apos;ll see !
lainey may have confessed , but i wasn &apos;t convinced .
i was about to blow this case wide open .
dude , you okay ?
yeah , adam said you had a bathroom @-@ based emergency .
yeah , i brought the back @-@ up khakis from my locker .
this isn &apos;t my first rodeo .
what ? adam said you guys had a bathroom @-@ based emergency .
i , too , have attended that sad rodeo .
gentlemen .
there is no bathroom @-@ based emergency ,
only a laundry @-@ based mystery ,
and i &apos;ve gathered all of you here
&apos;cause the culprit stands amongst us .
jtp , is this true ?
what ? !
never !
so that &apos;s a no on the khakis ?
they were all over at the house on the day in question .
that means all of you had opportunity .
that &apos;s insane .
insane like the jealousy you felt
every time barry wore big orange ?
you loved that shirt but knew you could never pull it off ,
&apos;cause you were too tiny .
i prefer small @-@ boned .
or was it naked rob ? !
a closet penguins fan .
the penguins ? robert .
i was born in pittsburgh .
or maybe it was geoff schwartz !
you knew taking out barry &apos;s favorite shirt
would make him melt down .
lainey would have to console him ,
leaving erica without a best friend
and plenty of time for you to win her heart .
wait , would that work ?
i will kill you dead !
no , barry . i didn &apos;t do it !
he &apos;s right . he didn &apos;t do it ...
alone .
it was the entire jtp !
okay . if this is true ,
i must disband the jtp .
jtp ? !
oh , it &apos;s true .
thank god i kept digging
even after lainey confessed
to destroying the shirt with mom .
yeah , thank god .
wait , what ?
i can &apos;t believe the two of you
would betray me like this .
big orange was better to me than either of you ever were .
it &apos;s just a shirt , babe .
we didn &apos;t know how much it meant to you .
and in our defense , we didn &apos;t know we &apos;d get caught .
i don &apos;t want to hear it !
from this moment on ,
i officially declare i have no girlfriend and no mother .
you can &apos;t do that .
yeah , you can &apos;t do that .
well , you can do it to her ,
but you can &apos;t do it to your mother .
i say this all the time -- you only have one mother .
well , i &apos;ll find another one .
you wouldn &apos;t dare .
i will .
i &apos;ll tell that nice , old lunch lady
who always calls me &quot; son &quot; to put her money where her mouth is .
well , i hate to point fingers ,
but , uh , this is on you and only you and no one else and not me .
are you kidding me ? this whole thing was your idea .
what kind of mother does that to her son ?
a mother who doesn &apos;t approve
of her son &apos;s snitch of a girlfriend .
ex @-@ girlfriend -- thanks to you !
you promised not to tell
and you narced like a narc , you narc .
i didn &apos;t tell barry .
the little geek went off on his own .
only &apos; cause you and dad kept insisting i drop the case .
wait , murray . you knew about this ?
great . i told you not to go off half @-@ cocked like a cowboy ,
but you had to play by your own rules !
that &apos;s as much anger as i can muster for something so stupid .
great job , genius .
you made everyone in this house completely turn on each other .
blame yourself , narc .
and i would &apos;ve gotten away with it , too ,
if it weren &apos;t for you meddling kids .
it &apos;s not my fault .
the case seemed so cut and dry .
back when we were kids . there was always a twist .
hello ! mom forced me to go up in that treehouse
and play with you , so i made up all those cases .
s @-@ so , you lied to me ?
yes . my god .
you are going to be in high school next year .
you need to grow up , and fast ,
because i &apos;m done taking care of you !
i just ...
wanted to hang out like we used to .
that &apos;s all i wanted .
it had been a day since barry had lost big orange forever ,
or so he thought .
ta @-@ da !
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s big orange , squishy .
big orange is gone .
big orange was gone ,
but i sewed him up , dyed him , and steamed him real good ,
and now he &apos;s bigger , better , and more orangy than ever .
hey , big tasty , look what i got !
and old friend wants to say &quot; hello . &quot;
wow ! lucky me !
now i got two big oranges .
what the --
why are you here ?
to get barry back .
that &apos;s what i was trying to do ,
but now you &apos;re screwing me in the pooper !
oh , sweet god !
what ? what &apos;d i say ? is that bad ?
unbelievable ! you not only destroy my shirt ,
but come in here and try pawning off these imposters ?
imposters ? mama fixed it .
this is the real thing .
no , this is .
this is it .
this shirt is . see ? it &apos;s orange and a shirt .
i reject all these shirts with their coarse material
and tight collar and non @-@ stained pit parts .
these aren &apos;t big orange , they &apos;re big lies .
i know you &apos;re upset , sweetie ,
but don &apos;t throw out the beverly with the lainey water .
look what i sewed back up !
large orange , now everyone &apos;s happy .
that &apos;s garfield !
i need to punch something . adam , i need you !
that did not go well .
it &apos;s over . i have no son .
and i have no boyfriend .
i think garfunkle is sporty . i @-@ i &apos;m keeping this thing .
in that moment , my mom and lainey realized
they hadn &apos;t just ruined barry &apos;s shirt ,
they destroyed his trust .
there was only one way to win him back ,
and that meant helping him truly cope with his loss .
what &apos;s going on ?
look , we messed up ,
and we know there &apos;s no way of going back ,
so we brought everyone here to help you move forward .
by saying goodbye -- the right way .
this is nice . my shirt would &apos;ve liked this .
they really did a great job with big orange , bar .
yeah , they really did . they made him look so peaceful .
murray ! turn off the tv .
i &apos;ll mute it , but that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s just a shirt .
honey , do you have anything you want to say ?
i &apos;d like to say a few words about big orange .
it &apos;s like , life goes so fast when you &apos;re growing up .
i guess it was nice there was something
that was always the same .
i mean , all my greatest memories were in that shirt . dad !
i was wearing it when we went to our first flyers game .
it &apos;s a shirt !
jtp , the first time i ever played smashball ,
i was in that shirt .
jtp .
ma , you taught me how to cook in that shirt .
lainey , i ran in the rain in that shirt
to tell you how much i love you .
so i guess ...
... i &apos;m gonna miss the memories ...
but i &apos;m glad i still have them .
to big orange !
to big orange !
wait , that &apos;s what this is ? a shirt funeral ?
damn it . i missed a real funeral for this .
the most painful part of growing up
is saying farewell to the stuff you love the most .
but as much as it hurts ,
we all have to tear down the old things
to make room for what &apos;s new .
the goldberg gang is on the case . to the treehouse !
we &apos;re gonna be communicating
through this walkie @-@ talkie system .
you ready , adam ?
copy ?
anybody there ?
it &apos;s gonna be great .
okay , over and out .
still watching those old tapes , huh ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m over it .
come with me . i want to show you something .
why would i want to go anywhere with you ?
i thought you like mysteries .
what &apos;s this ?
i thought we could build a new treehouse .
but i thought it was time to let it go .
well , some things are worth holding on to .
our old blueprints ?
you still have them ?
the truth is , when we were kids ,
i didn &apos;t make up those mysteries because i had to .
i did it &apos; cause i loved spending time with you .
letting go of the past is hard ...
... but what &apos;s even harder is that we &apos;ll never know
what the future holds for us .
but when you finally stumble upon that perfect fit in life ...
... nothing is more rewarding .
yes !
okay , troy &apos;s freestyle on this one .
* yeah , you know it &apos;s me
* yeah , it &apos;s big tasty , the one and only *
* grabbing on the mikey and i gots the gravy *
* you know i &apos;m gonna go a little bit shady *
* and we ricky @-@ ricky @-@ ticky @-@ ticky rhyme to the dime *
* yeah , you know me , always going kind of crazy with them lines *
* and i &apos;m fly @-@ fly , yeah , you know it , lainey , baby *
* and we doing it and we in the &apos; 80s *
* and we on fleek , on fleek all night long *
* and you know , know , know we &apos;ll be singing that song *
* and dab , dab , dab on them hoes *
* and we go , go , go and we all jump , hey *
