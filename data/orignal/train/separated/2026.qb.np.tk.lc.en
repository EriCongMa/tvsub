sheila amanda sazs ,
will you marry me ?
yes , i will marry you .
i want to go legit .
you can &apos;t .
then i get lola jensen to hack into the bar
and just put me in there , just like she did with harvard .
rule number one of not getting caught ,
you don &apos;t move the goddamn body .
harvey , i &apos;m stuck .
i can &apos;t live my whole life like this .
you want me to set up your new corporation ?
i want you to join my new corporation .
we &apos;re not lawyers . we &apos;re investment bankers .
our job blows yours out of the water .
scottie , i need you to give louis his transaction back .
does this have something to do with that favor he did you ?
yes .
tell me what it is .
i can &apos;t .
guess we &apos;re not sharing
everything with each other after all .
scottie .
you can &apos;t have it both ways , harvey .
louis , i don &apos;t want kids .
what are you talking about ?
i don &apos;t like kids .
i was willing to give up harvard for you .
you can &apos;t give up something for me ?
i understand . can i just say something please ?
i know you keep saying that i won &apos;t feel this way forever ,
but why is it when the guys shows up
with chicken vindaloo 40 minutes late
with no naan and no silverware ,
instead of throwing the chutney in his face ,
i &apos;m thanking him and i am tipping him $ 20 ?
do you want to tell me why that happens ?
i don &apos;t care . i hate myself .
i hate my life .
the woman i love is gone , my heart is broken ,
and i really-- to be honest with you ,
i just don &apos;t have the will to live .
hold on . it &apos;s my associate .
katrina .
louis , it &apos;s 7 : 55 .
yeah . i have an 8 : 00 a.m.
please cover it for me . in fact , cover everything ,
and unless the building is on fire and sheila &apos;s in it ,
i &apos;m not coming in .
louis , what happened ?
you wanna know what happened ? i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
my heart &apos;s been shattered into a thousand million pieces ,
and if i can &apos;t put my heart into my work ,
then i &apos;m not gonna do any work at all , so ...
how long do you think you &apos;ll be out ?
i don &apos;t know . today , tomorrow ,
the rest of the year .
you know , just don &apos;t call here again
because i &apos;m not gonna answer the number .
doc ?
dr. lipschitz ?
hello ?
what , are you shitting me ? that was not 50 minutes .
waiting outside for me ? bold gesture .
i called you three times . i had to do something .
you must be feeling bad .
i am .
what for ? you &apos;re just doing your job .
scottie , i &apos;m sorry .
what happened with louis , i didn &apos;t like doing it .
yeah , but you still did it .
and what i &apos;m doing now
is asking you to let it go .
harvey , it &apos;s not that you picked louis over me .
it &apos;s that you wouldn &apos;t tell me why .
i couldn &apos;t tell you why . there &apos;s a difference .
and i &apos;m asking you to trust me .
okay .
i can let it go , but keeping things from me
just can &apos;t keep happening , okay ?
i can &apos;t tell you whether or not that &apos;s okay ,
and i definitely can &apos;t tell you why .
too soon ?
what are you going to do to make it up to me ?
nothing right now .
i &apos;m taking mike to the marathon footwear brunch .
you &apos;re taking a date to an i.p.o. event ?
that &apos;s so cute .
it &apos;s not a date .
he &apos;s never gonna put out .
well , it &apos;s too bad that you &apos;re not taking me
because i was thinking of letting you ...
mr. specter .
james quelling .
i &apos;m in a bit of a hurry , mr. quelling .
i want to do you a favor .
i don &apos;t need any favors .
yeah , you do , unless you want friday &apos;s headline to read ,
&quot; marathon footwear builds playgrounds that kill children . &quot;
my client builds playgrounds that help children .
and uses a synthetic full of toxins to do it .
look , i don &apos;t know who you are ,
but i know what you &apos;re trying to do , and it isn &apos;t gonna work .
look , i &apos;m a reasonable man .
this is a huge moment for your client .
i won &apos;t file this before friday .
you think i &apos;m gonna let you extort my client ?
no , i think you &apos;re gonna protect your client
from a claim that could ruin them .
in fact , i &apos;m counting on it .
nice offices . enjoy that brunch .
i got a job offer .
holy shit . from who ?
last night . jonathan sidwell .
but i thought louis was his lawyer .
he doesn &apos;t want me to be his lawyer .
he wants me to be a partner .
investment banking ?
yeah .
and ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you think ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you think ?
i think that i love you ,
and what you want to do is what i want you to do .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
okay . did you talk to harvey ?
if i do that , all he &apos;ll hear is , &quot; hey , harvey ,
&quot; thanks for doing everything for me .
i &apos;m thinking about quitting . &quot;
no , but you said that you don &apos;t think of him as just your boss .
you consider him a friend .
so ?
so if he can &apos;t have an honest conversation
with your best interests in mind ,
he &apos;s not your friend , and-- and he shouldn &apos;t be your boss .
i have to talk to you about something .
well , unless its value is in excess of $ 575 million ,
it can wait .
yeah . yeah , it can wait .
good because our i.p.o. is in jeopardy
unless we can deal with this .
endangering children ? wait , these things just opened .
this is a bullshit claim .
maybe , but a bullshit claim on the right day
is better than a great claim on a bullshit day .
did you come up with that all by yourself ?
my grandmother taught it to me .
what do you need me to do ?
i need you to find
everything there is to know about this quelling guy .
harvey , why don &apos;t you just pay him off ?
protect the i.p.o. ?
i worked my ass off for this day .
he &apos;s trying to hijack it . i &apos;m not gonna be extorted
by some piece of shit i &apos;ve never heard of .
okay . on it .
jessica .
donna , what can i do for you ?
i was just walking by reception ,
and i thought you might like to know--you know ,
because it &apos;s your firm and-
donna , get to it .
charles van dyke is in the lobby .
right now ?
30 seconds ago .
you were right to come to me .
would you like me to send him on his way ?
i prefer to take care of charles van dyke myself .
excellent .
you can stare at it all you want , charles ,
but it &apos;s not going to change .
i was just thinking ,
&quot; i can &apos;t believe you put the mailroom boy &apos;s name
on the wall . &quot;
i think what you mean is
that you can &apos;t believe yours was ever taken off .
i put that behind me years ago .
what are you doing here , charles ?
i suggest we go in your office and talk .
right here is just fine .
what do you want ?
i want a 30 % increase in my dividend check .
good @-@ bye , charles .
i thought you &apos;d say that .
this is formal notice of my demand to audit your books .
you have until friday to comply .
you gave up this right when we ran you out of town .
i think you &apos;re forgetting i retain that right
in the event of any material change in my dividend .
your dividend went up .
materially .
you think we &apos;re hiding profits .
from what i know of you , you &apos;re always hiding something .
i &apos;m gonna make it fast , jim .
james .
that &apos;s not what your ex @-@ wife calls you .
she calls you jim .
that &apos;s one of the nicer names she uses .
she &apos;s been calling you a lot these days .
wow , you found out i &apos;m divorced .
well , i &apos;ll withdraw the lawsuit .
it &apos;s not the divorce , jimbo ,
it &apos;s the huge wall of mounting debt that &apos;s closing in on you
since you tanked the tobacco litigation .
i didn &apos;t tank it . i lost .
you didn &apos;t just lose .
you had an offer that would have set you up for life .
instead , you rolled the dice , went to verdict ,
and now you got nothing .
which is why your wife left you ,
and now you &apos;re coming after us with a fabricated claim .
i didn &apos;t fabricate anything . i have expert reports here .
you &apos;ve got one report of possible toxins
in the playground material .
and not one sick child .
and you have an i.p.o. on friday ,
and if this suit appears in the journal that morning ,
what do you think the stock price is gonna be
when they ring that bell ?
got me . give me your number .
100,000 and we &apos;re done .
done .
we &apos;ll draw up the paperwork .
i &apos;ve got it right here .
but one thing , this precludes you
from representing any other plaintiffs with the same action .
you got me .
i have 100 other plaintiffs waiting in the wings .
that &apos;s a $ 10 million hit you just avoided .
i tell you what .
give me a million , and we &apos;re really done .
james , this covers your debts and gets you out from under .
you think that means i &apos;m gonna take less than it &apos;s worth ?
it isn &apos;t worth anything .
it is today .
you know where to reach me .
thought you said you were willing to go
as high as 500,000 .
yeah , that was before
i realized what we were dealing with .
this guy doesn &apos;t owe money &apos; cause he got divorced .
he got divorced &apos; cause he owes money .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s a gambler .
how does that help us ?
he doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m one .
where &apos;s louis ?
jessica .
where is he ?
he &apos;s not answering his phone . he &apos;s not answering his emails .
the thing is i don &apos;t know if he--
katrina , your job as gatekeeper
does not apply to me , so i &apos;m going to ask you one more time .
why isn &apos;t louis in the building ?
he must still be in court .
is there something i can do ?
what you can do
is find louis and have him come up with a way around
this demand to look at our books .
when should i tell him you need it ?
yesterday .
you were right . quelling &apos;s got a game .
what night ?
every night .
well , i hope you know where tonight &apos;s game is because--
great .
you and i are going .
what ?
i got a job offer , harvey .
supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight .
i can move it , it &apos;s just , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s why i hesitated .
when ?
when what ?
when &apos;d you get the job offer ?
the other night .
and you didn &apos;t mention it .
i didn &apos;t know what i thought .
and now you do ?
no . it &apos;s--
who ?
jonathan sidwell .
the spin @-@ off idea ?
yeah .
i should have known .
he wants you to be his general counsel ?
no , he wants to make me an investment banker .
well , if it were me ... i &apos;d take it .
what ? why ?
because you can compete there like you do here
with nothing hanging over your head .
what if i don &apos;t want to stop being a lawyer ?
well , then don &apos;t take the job .
i mean , what do you want from me ?
i want your advice .
i just gave you my advice .
no , you told me what you would do .
i want to know what you think i should do .
mike , last week , you said you &apos;d do anything
to stop being a fraud , so my advice is take it .
still be in the majors , just be a different sport .
excuse me , do you have a minute ?
look , you and i have never--
no , we haven &apos;t .
i need your help .
you must be scraping the bottom of the barrel
if you &apos;re coming to me .
it &apos;s about louis .
he and sheila are done .
that &apos;s awful .
it &apos;s worse than awful .
jessica needs him on a case right now .
he won &apos;t leave his apartment . he won &apos;t even answer his phone .
then i &apos;ll just go over there right now .
that won &apos;t work .
even if it did , we don &apos;t have time .
so then why are you here ?
rachel , you don &apos;t trust me .
i get that , but louis asked me to cover for him ,
and that is what i &apos;m going to do .
you &apos;re the best paralegal here ,
and you &apos;re his friend .
so will you help me or not ?
i will .
so ... i figured out what you can do to make it up to me tonight .
i thought we were good .
yeah , i &apos;m just--i &apos;m feeling some residual anger .
scottie , i &apos;m kind of busy right now ,
and i have plans tonight .
taking mike on another i.p.o. date ?
what difference does it make ?
sounds mysterious .
bet you can &apos;t tell me what it is .
i &apos;m playing poker .
poker ?
can i come ?
it &apos;s a work thing .
you bring mike to work things .
scottie , i told you i &apos;m busy . you can &apos;t come .
can i get back to work now ?
what got into you ?
nothing .
sometimes at the office , i &apos;m working .
fair enough , boss .
are you sure that &apos;s how you want to play that ?
play what , the fact that i &apos;m busy ?
the fact that you just snapped at her
when we both know what you &apos;re really angry about .
i &apos;m not angry . i &apos;m annoyed at the interruption .
you &apos;re angry that mike wants to leave ,
and you just took it out on her .
i &apos;m not angry about that .
no , you &apos;re hurt ,
and the anger covers the hurt , but i knew you didn &apos;t know that .
i was annoyed about the interruption
just like i &apos;m annoyed right now .
bullshit .
you &apos;re feeling exactly what i &apos;m feeling .
the idea of mike leaving sucks ,
and the sooner you get your brain around that ,
the sooner you can maybe do something about it .
can i get back to work now ?
you can get back to work whenever you want .
but if all you &apos;re gonna do is stick your head in the sand ,
then you &apos;re not going to have
an associate or a girlfriend to get back to work from .
you give it to her ?
i gave it to her .
she suspect anything ?
i wouldn &apos;t be standing here if she did .
and ?
she thought it was awesome .
well , she should .
louis didn &apos;t just come up with a way
to keep charles van dyke out of our books .
louis came up with a way to blow him out of the water .
that louis . he is one hell of an attorney .
thank you , louis .
right back at you , louis .
don &apos;t get used to it .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m not looking to work here again .
not here , but you are looking to work ?
i &apos;ve always been able to see through your bullshit , charles .
which is why i &apos;m offering you these ,
five cases .
we &apos;re co @-@ counsel , split the profits 50 / 50 .
it announces to the world that you are back in business ,
which is what you really want .
you came to me bearing gifts .
i still have the card .
&quot; to the man who hired me for all you &apos;ve done . &quot;
two days later , you shoved me out .
i take this to mean you &apos;re passing on my offer .
i &apos;m shiting on your offer .
okay , charles . you were right .
your dividend check did have the wrong amount ,
but from now on , it &apos;s going to have the right amount ,
zero .
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , the firm you had your exit agreement with no longer exists .
we became pearson darby ,
then pearson specter ,
which means you &apos;re not entitled to a thing .
that &apos;s not in the spirit of our agreement .
and neither is your claim .
there &apos;s only one problem .
you should have dug deeper into the fine print .
the entity referred to in our agreement
is defined in your bylaws as
&quot; any partnership in which
the name partner is jessica pearson . &quot;
you didn &apos;t know .
my number just tripled .
your call .
our hearing is friday .
you guys playing cards ?
you &apos;re out of your league . this game is for real players .
why don &apos;t i give it a try ?
buy @-@ in is 25,000 .
what &apos;s the limit ?
there is no limit .
maybe i am out of my league .
raise $ 45,000 .
i &apos;m putting you all @-@ in .
i &apos;ve seen guys like you before .
you think if you bully me with your big stack ,
i &apos;m gonna run and hide .
here &apos;s the difference between you and me , jimbo ,
i lose , i pull out another 25 grand ,
and another 25 after that .
you lose , you &apos;ve got nothing .
you &apos;re bluffing .
then call or get up and walk away ,
but i &apos;ve sat across from you 1,000 times before .
you won &apos;t walk .
tough beat .
take your winnings .
what winnings ?
i thought maybe it was time we do a little negotiating .
well , you have my offer .
i have a counter .
i &apos;m all ears .
i want a 50 % increase in base salary .
i want a guaranteed bonus not tied to our investment returns ,
a four @-@ week vacation , and i want a piece .
a piece ?
a piece .
no .
no piece ?
no negotiating . look , i know what you &apos;re doing .
you can &apos;t make up your mind ,
so you want me to make it up for you .
but i don &apos;t want someone who &apos;s with me for the money .
i want someone who &apos;s with me
&apos;cause they want to kick some ass .
i do kick ass .
and if you want to take this job right now ,
i will negotiate in good faith .
but you don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t yet .
starting tomorrow ,
i &apos;ll be interviewing other people .
once i find the right person ,
job is gone .
i &apos;m not dropping my suit when you &apos;re going public in two days .
james , you &apos;ve read all about hessington oil .
the odds were stacked against me .
i won anyway , because i win .
you won because edward darby came forward .
you got lucky .
guys like you always think other people get lucky .
i don &apos;t get lucky .
i make my own luck ,
and in this case , it &apos;s bleeding you dry .
right there .
you just gave me your tell . you have no other money .
you &apos;re done . there &apos;s $ 100,000 in that pile .
it &apos;s the exact amount of the deal we offered you .
sign it .
we &apos;ll fix the paperwork tomorrow .
this is $ 1,000 . cash me out .
he doesn &apos;t play anymore the rest of the night .
you didn &apos;t sleep well .
i didn &apos;t sleep at all .
it &apos;s a big decision .
you still haven &apos;t told me what you think .
mike , i can &apos;t make the decision for you .
i don &apos;t want you to make it for me .
i just want to know what you think .
and i already told you that i will support you
with whatever you decide .
and the way you can support me
right now is by telling me how you feel .
it &apos;s not my place .
not your place ?
just admit it . you want me to take the job ,
but you &apos;re too afraid to say it .
okay , you want to know the truth ?
you already know what you want to do .
and if i try to change your mind and it goes wrong ,
then i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna hold it against me .
would you just say it ?
yes . i want you to take the job .
look , i know that you love what you do ,
but every day , you go into work with the possibility
of being caught , and it is eating away at you .
if you stay there , that &apos;s just not gonna change .
jessica . how did--
it go ?
i &apos;ll tell you how it went . i got hung out to dry .
what ? no , it was a good move .
oh , it would have been
if our own bylaws didn &apos;t supersede it .
th @-@ that &apos;s impossible .
it was convoluted and buried in the fine print ,
and something louis litt never would have missed .
look me in the eye and tell me i &apos;m wrong .
you &apos;re not . he wouldn &apos;t have missed it .
so when you came into my office
and told me louis had come up with that move ,
you were full of shit .
i &apos;m sorry . i wanted to help .
well , that kind of thing only happens once .
you know how i know it &apos;s not gonna happen again ?
pack up your shit .
i don &apos;t care what kind of deal you have with harvey .
you &apos;re done .
why wouldn &apos;t you tell her ?
i said i would cover .
i didn &apos;t say i would cover when it suited me .
yeah , but he wouldn &apos;t want you to get fired over this .
i should be fired . i let jessica look stupid .
katrina--
thank you for your help , rachel .
i really appreciate it ,
but if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to be alone .
he &apos;s not here .
where is he ?
to tell you the truth , i don &apos;t know .
all he said was he had a late night .
well , i can come back .
i was just--
you &apos;re taking the job ,
aren &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know .
yeah , you do .
you just don &apos;t want to admit it .
yeah . i &apos;m taking the job .
god damn it .
do you know what that man has done for you ?
do you know what it took for him to start trusting someone ?
donna--
don &apos;t interrupt me .
so someone &apos;s dangling some money in front of you .
it &apos;s not about that .
i don &apos;t care what it &apos;s about .
i &apos;m gonna say what he won &apos;t .
he needs you .
you need this job , and if you can &apos;t see that ,
then you might as well just leave right now .
donna , someone &apos;s offering me a way out .
so you don &apos;t care about him .
of course i do ,
but i also care about my life with rachel .
i don &apos;t want to live my life like this anymore .
then you better be the best goddamn investment banker
this city has ever seen .
scottie , i &apos;m sorry i was angry in your direction ,
but it was really about something else .
let me guess , donna explained your feelings to you ,
and now you &apos;re here to apologize .
maybe .
what was the something else ?
mike got a job offer .
and you don &apos;t want him to do it .
no , i don &apos;t .
well , if you want him to stay ,
you know what &apos;s actually a nice tactic ?
telling him you want him to stay .
what ?
had i known &quot; tell me what &apos;s going on with you &quot;
meant &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you what to do , &quot;
i might not have taken you up on it .
oh , okay . mmm .
i &apos;ll see you in there .
okay .
you have that paperwork for me ?
well , i got something for you , but it &apos;s not that .
didn &apos;t you learn your lesson last night ?
i learned to listen .
when you talked ,
you mentioned hessington oil , so i looked back into it .
turns out you don &apos;t create your own luck .
your associate does .
what the hell are you talking about ?
he conspired with harold gunderson
to file a lawsuit against your own client
so you could bribe witnesses not to testify .
we didn &apos;t bribe anyone .
that was a legal settlement .
don &apos;t try to tell me
two rookie associates who went to law school together
and started at the same firm made this happen
without collusion .
i don &apos;t need to tell you
anything &apos; cause there &apos;s nothing to tell .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to tell someone something ,
because that suit was filed one day , settled the next ,
and those witnesses cancelled their flights to new york .
that is a bribe ,
and when i bring it to the attention of the bar ,
you and your associate are going to be in deep shit .
now who showed his tell ?
here &apos;s your money back .
and either i go to the bar , or you settle for $ 2 million .
you have until tomorrow .
where is mike ?
he &apos;s in there .
harvey--
harvey .
not now .
you need to call lola jensen .
what ?
you need to get her to hack into the bar
and put your name in .
what the hell are you talking about ?
a week ago , you told me that the number one rule
was not to move the goddamn body .
a week ago , people weren &apos;t sniffing around you .
harvey , my job offer is not--
this isn &apos;t about your offer .
quelling knows about your bullshit lawsuit
with harold gunderson .
he turned me in ?
no , but he will if we don &apos;t cave .
he can &apos;t prove anything .
he doesn &apos;t have to .
he hands you in to the bar ,
they look you up , we &apos;re done .
not if i &apos;m not here .
oh , that &apos;s why you &apos;re in here .
you &apos;re taking the job .
i am .
and you think an addicted gambler
who lost his wife , his child , and his house is gonna stop
coming for you just because you &apos;re not working here ?
you said it yourself . hacking into the bar
is twice the crime i &apos;ve been committing .
i am telling you quelling is on the trail .
you don &apos;t do this , we &apos;re gonna get caught .
there &apos;s got to be another way .
there isn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t believe that .
then you better
figure something out fast , because tomorrow morning ,
we &apos;re done , and you quitting isn &apos;t gonna change that .
you can &apos;t fire katrina bennett .
i can fire whoever i want to .
she was covering for louis .
what are you talking about ?
louis &apos;s engagement is over , and he &apos;s losing it .
he won &apos;t come in to work , he won &apos;t pick up his phone ,
and he just didn &apos;t want anyone to know .
then why are you telling me ?
because i helped her cover for him .
are you saying i should fire you too ?
i am saying that ...
we made a mistake ,
but that we were just looking out for louis ,
and i know how much you value loyalty ,
so i don &apos;t think that should be the thing
that costs katrina her job ...
or mine .
jessica .
i need you .
no , listen , i just need a little more time .
and had you asked me for it , i would have said yes ,
but instead , you had katrina cover for you .
oh , that little traitor . what , did she rat me out ?
no , she didn &apos;t . she &apos;s so loyal to you
that she tried to pass off her work for yours .
louis , van dyke wants to look at our books .
what ? we can &apos;t have that .
i know . this was her fix .
oh , no , and you used this on him ?
i did , and then i fired katrina .
jessica .
i know .
i can &apos;t fire her for being loyal .
but i can &apos;t afford you sitting here licking your wounds
while i get my ass handed to me .
please , just listen to me , okay ?
i cannot see straight .
i cannot think straight ,
and even if i wanted to come and help you ,
i wouldn &apos;t be any good to you , so ...
louis ...
i know you loved sheila ,
but do you love your firm ?
you know i do .
and when you love a woman ,
can you stand the thought of her being with another man ?
no .
well , louis ,
van dyke is trying to get into pearson specter &apos;s pants .
what are you going to do about it ?
i &apos;m gonna put on a goddamn chastity belt .
how ?
&apos;cause katrina actually was on the right track .
van dyke &apos;s claim is gone if the partnership is gone .
the bylaws say it &apos;s not .
no , it is if we become an l.l.c.
we can &apos;t do that by tomorrow .
we &apos;d have to rewrite every contract .
boy , wow , jessica , you sometimes really surprise me .
you don &apos;t think i know that ?
i have an army of associates that i &apos;ve trained
within an inch of their lives .
my name is louis goddamn marlowe litt ,
and my firm is under siege , so don &apos;t you tell me
what i can and cannot do !
i don &apos;t want to interrupt , but i was just wondering
what happened with mike .
he &apos;s leaving .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s fine .
can i ask you something ?
did you tell him that you wanted him to stay ?
i didn &apos;t get around to it .
you--you didn &apos;t get around to it ?
i was gonna tell him , and then he told me he was leaving ,
and then other shit came up , so ...
so you just dropped it ?
i told you other shit came up .
what other shit ?
i mean , you had an emergency case filing ,
so you let your protege walk out the door ?
it &apos;s complicated .
okay .
well , then share it with me .
quelling came after us . the hessington witnesses .
what ? that &apos;s bullshit .
you may have blurred some lines ,
but you certainly didn &apos;t cross any .
fight him .
no , i can &apos;t .
why ?
look , i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
what is going on here ? when somebody pisses you off ,
you get in the ring .
what are you saying ?
what i &apos;m saying is that you &apos;re not taking on quelling ,
but you &apos;re letting mike walk out the door
without trying to stop him .
i think one thing changed the other ,
and i want to know why .
maybe what changed is his desire to be here ,
and maybe what i have to say doesn &apos;t matter .
of course it matters . now , what is this really about ?
because it &apos;s sure as hell not about some stupid case .
you know what ? god damn it !
for once , can &apos;t it just be about what i said it &apos;s about ?
you didn &apos;t say what it was about .
harvey , i &apos;m really sorry
that the mike thing turned out this way .
i am , but i can &apos;t say that i didn &apos;t see it coming .
scottie , it isn &apos;t--
what ? it isn &apos;t what ?
it isn &apos;t what it seems ?
because i don &apos;t know what it seems .
all i know is that any time i ask you about anything ,
all you say is , &quot; i can &apos;t talk about it . &quot;
i &apos;m just gonna stop asking .
then we &apos;ll just make up later ,
and we can do it all over again tomorrow .
quelling can &apos;t hurt us anymore .
you went to see lola .
i looked at his accounts .
i wanted to find out where all that money came from
to find all those clients .
he doesn &apos;t have the money .
and yet his rent gets paid ,
and they don &apos;t turn off his electricity .
holy shit .
guess you didn &apos;t have to see lola after all .
you think i got access to that with a court order ?
so you did go see her ?
you put the idea in my head .
i just came up with a different agenda .
we got him .
no .
you got him .
what ?
your going @-@ away present .
be a lawyer one last time . knock this guy out .
you have my settlement check .
i don &apos;t have a dime for you .
then i guess the bar is going to be hearing from me
first thing in the morning .
well , then , they &apos;ll also be hearing from me .
disciplinary rule 5 @-@ 107a , &quot; accepting compensation-- &quot;
i know what it says .
then you also know the penalty is being disbarred .
you took money from our client &apos;s competitors
to trump up your bullshit suit .
you didn &apos;t come by that legally .
and they &apos;re not gonna care .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed ,
but i don &apos;t have a hell of a lot to lose ,
so sign my deal or get the hell out of my office .
well , here &apos;s the thing , james .
i don &apos;t either ...
because today is my last day as a lawyer anyway .
bullshit .
look at me .
good luck in front of the bar .
i wasn &apos;t always like this .
i had tobacco in my sights .
they offered me a lot of money .
i could have made a fortune .
but $ 15,000 per client for people with cancer ?
i risked going to verdict because i wanted to
get those people something that could make a difference !
and i lost everything ...
my clients , my wife , my kids !
you lost them because you gambled them away , james .
i know that .
please .
being a lawyer is what i am .
it &apos;s who i am .
and if you take that away ...
it &apos;s up to you , james .
i &apos;ll drop the suit .
i promise .
louis , where the hell are you ?
you said you could get it done .
i walk through those doors , our books fly open .
get here now .
well , this should be fun .
we &apos;ve never been across the aisle from each other .
which is why you don &apos;t realize that it won &apos;t be fun .
we &apos;ll see what we see .
case 41432 , van dyke versus pearson .
look at that . game time .
ladies first .
ladies first .
son of a bitch .
for being polite ?
were you being polite when you hired me ?
what does one have to do with the other ?
&quot; to the man who hired me , for all you &apos;ve done . &quot;
do you want to know what i meant when i wrote that card ?
the day you made me that offer , i asked you ,
&quot; did it have anything to do with gender or race ? &quot;
you swore it didn &apos;t .
you lied to me .
it didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re lying now .
you know , daniel hardman may have used people ,
but he didn &apos;t give a shit about their gender
or their color .
he showed you the list .
right next to my name , an asterisk . not &quot; law review . &quot;
not second in my class . diversity .
you were treated the same .
you tell yourself that , but we both know the truth ,
which is why i sleep at night just fine .
well , it doesn &apos;t change the facts in this case , does it ?
no . no , it doesn &apos;t , but this will .
charles , you remember louis litt ?
sorry , i couldn &apos;t run .
doctor wanted me to take it easy .
hey , charles .
great to see you .
you told me that story to stall .
that was a stall ...
but this is for me .
when i saw that asterisk next to my name ,
it made me sick to my stomach , because in one second ,
i understood how you will always see me .
so that card was a thank you ,
because if i hadn &apos;t have felt sick ,
then i might not have worked as hard as i did
to get where i am today .
you woke the dragon , charles .
how do you like me now ?
i know you &apos;re there .
you need anything ?
no .
the i.p.o. is wrapped up .
we go public monday morning .
i wasn &apos;t talking about the i.p.o.
i was talking about how you &apos;re feeling about mike .
i know .
okay .
good night , harvey .
i &apos;m gonna tell scottie .
about mike ? are you crazy ?
you can &apos;t have it both ways , donna .
you can &apos;t tell me to open up and then keep my secrets .
you spent more than a year covering it up .
you tried to get him to commit another crime to cover it up ,
and now--
you said i should tell her
what &apos;s really bothering me !
i meant your feelings .
i didn &apos;t mean confess to a felony .
these are my goddamn feelings !
donna , i did something when i hired him .
it &apos;s caused all of this .
i can &apos;t tell her , and it &apos;s driving me crazy !
okay . look , mike is gone , harvey .
i hate that he &apos;s gone , but the jeopardy &apos;s gone too .
it &apos;s done .
and now you want to turn around and tell someone who--
someone who what ?
nothing .
no , you better finish that sentence .
someone who &apos;s pissed at you , harvey .
someone who keeps finding a reason to be pissed at you ,
and it &apos;s not the third time , and it &apos;s not the fifth time ,
and it &apos;s not the last time .
i thought you were trying
to help my relationship , not shit on it .
okay , you want to yell at me ? fine .
because i know you &apos;re not mad at me .
and i know you &apos;re only telling me this stupid idea
because you want me to tell you what you already know .
you can &apos;t , harvey .
it &apos;s good that you want to , but you can &apos;t .
could i have a minute ?
congratulate me .
i &apos;m officially a member of the new york bar .
you went to lola ?
i made a mistake . i want to stay .
