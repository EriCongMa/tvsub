i have an eyewitness from the two crows diner .
you fit the description , and i &apos;d like it
if you come in for a line @-@ up .
i spoke to jillian this morning .
i sort of ended up pitching you as co @-@ writer .
jillian approved the book .
that &apos;s amazing .
that &apos;s great .
i think the person the cops should
really be talking to is right over there .
you &apos;re welcome to stay here as long as you want .
can you believe that it &apos;s been three years
since we were in madrid ?
that &apos;s crazy .
were you looking to--
get married . tonight .
what is happenin &apos; ?
oh , my god !
aria !
have either of you heard of a restaurant
called the two crows ?
is anybody in there ? hello ?
the pull @-@ up handle is missing a rod .
it could &apos;ve been used as a weapon to crack someone &apos;s neck .
sara harvey wants this murder solved .
and whoever this was they want to cover it up .
there &apos;s now more than one person after us ?
i wonder who took this one
wait , there &apos;s more .
否则你输定了
oh , my god !
was it you ?
did you call charlotte that night
from the two crows diner ?
emily , i can &apos;t talk about this here .
get in the car . get in the car .
i called charlotte the night she was killed .
why ?
i asked her to meet me .
at the church ?
at the two crows .
i sat in that diner waiting for two hours .
she never showed up .
look , if someone saw me on the phone , they saw me
sitting there by myself with a cup of coffee
and a slice of apple pie .
was that your only time at the two crows ?
last friday night someone tried
to run me over in the parking lot there .
i was still working for yvonne &apos;s mother then .
making phone calls in a room with half dozen volunteers .
you wanted charlotte released .
that &apos;s why you had a change of heart in the hearing .
you were afraid aria &apos;s story would convince the judge
to keep her in the hospital , where you couldn &apos;t get to her .
i wasn &apos;t trying to get to her .
i just wanted to talk to her , away from everyone else .
you understand that .
sure .
after the special attention you got
at the bottom of a certain hole .
not just me , emily .
charlotte dilaurentis knew everything
about every one of us .
every mistake , every lie , every crime .
and she never implicated us
the five years she was locked up .
she just sat in that hospital
ticking like a time bomb .
and what would you have done if she &apos;d shown up ?
find out what she was gonna do with all her new freedom .
and if she said she was gonna tell everything
were you just gonna sit there eating your apple pie ?
maybe .
or maybe you were thinking about
doing something to stop her .
doesn &apos;t matter what i was thinking .
the fact is , she never showed up .
i &apos;ll drive you back .
what if it had been you ?
what if you called her and she showed up ?
what would you have done ?
mona basically told you she was ready to kill charlotte .
yeah , but she didn &apos;t , because charlotte never showed up .
not guilty because the victim didn &apos;t show ?
that &apos;s setting the bar pretty low . em
innocent , guilty , whatever .
she admits to being the brunette on the phone .
let @-@ let &apos;s tell tanner this , so i can get off the suspect list .
so do you think she &apos;s lying ?
pick a topic .
about charlotte not meeting her that night .
that &apos;s probably true . it &apos;s too easy to check .
while you two are discussing this , let &apos;s remember
that i was the one that was in a line @-@ up .
alright ? it &apos;s really unflattering lighting there .
so what , do we wait ?
for what ?
whoever this is wants us to hand over
charlotte &apos;s killer before election night .
and they &apos;re getting impatient .
well , does anyone wanna put some ointment
on that impatience ?
look , a free @-@ range mona is more likely to lead us someplace .
especially if she thinks we believe her .
so , we believe her ?
we believe her enough .
i just think it &apos;s a good idea to stay in rosewood
a little while longer .
well , i &apos;ll meet them when i get back .
well , then i &apos;ll meet them
the next time they &apos;re in new york .
look , tanner wants us to stay .
well , your lawyers are there , and i &apos;m here
so i have to go with my gut .
well , if i was in new york , all i &apos;d be thinking about
is aria and the others .
because they &apos;re my friends , jordan .
yes . you know i do .
alright , i &apos;ll call you later . i love you .
so do i get an invitation to the wedding ?
of course , you do .
i was half expecting to meet jordan when i got here .
yeah , well , he &apos;s a little phobic of small towns .
he thinks they exist only to escape from .
i used to think that .
what changed your mind ?
big cities .
oh , um , i picked up a few ties
that could go with the shirts i saw in your closet .
you did not have to do that .
well , it &apos;s just a little thank you for letting me stay here .
oh , and i put post @-@ its on what goes with what .
terrific . garanimals for grownups .
okay , so , i checked out the system .
and upgraded the firmware
and i took the fireplace off @-@ line
till i could replace this controller .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what happened but it will not happen again .
lucas , you didn &apos;t have to come back for that .
i wouldn &apos;t have , but i had to be here anyway .
i &apos;m checking out some property .
a house ?
no .
those empty factories and mills past the lake .
my accountants are telling me to spend money
and i figure if i can do something
with one of those little dinosaurs .
the accountants are happy
and the town gets a little bit of tax revenue .
aww , local boy makes good .
yeah . a little of that .
maybe i &apos;m giving this town a second chance .
i know what you mean .
when we finally got out of here , it was so fast .
we didn &apos;t really realize what we left behind .
so i will bring the new controller tonight .
anything that aria needs , just give me a call . okay ?
okay .
it &apos;s very late .
we almost missed the breakfast part
of bed and breakfast .
people will wonder what we were doing up here .
people will know exactly what we were doing here .
what do you wanna do today ?
i was thinking that we could find a lake
or a river and sit on the bank and read .
or not read .
i &apos;ll dig up a french impressionist .
pay him 50 bucks for a quick portrait .
perfect .
ali !
why do i have to stay here ?
because you had a concussion .
i &apos;m fine .
you will be , in a little while .
why do i have to stay in the hospital ?
you can take care of me , you &apos;re a doctor .
which is why i think it &apos;s a good idea for you to stay put .
this is not where i wanted to spend my honeymoon .
i &apos;m glad to hear you say that .
oh , it &apos;s the manager of the inn , expressing her concern .
well , i fell down her staircase , no wonder she &apos;s concerned .
they &apos;re checking the carpet and the bannister .
look , i don &apos;t want to sue anybody .
i just wanna go on a picnic .
which we will do , as soon as you &apos;re all checked out .
what is it ?
i was really , really happy
the moment before i tripped .
and i wonder if that &apos;s why i fell .
maybe every good thing has to be paid for by a bad thing .
that &apos;s not how the universe works .
sometimes i feel like i &apos;m being punished
for surviving . still being alive .
or maybe you just snagged
your shoe on the carpet .
and the planets did not align to give you a bump on the head .
it was an accident . that &apos;s all .
babe , where &apos;s my phone ?
she says it was an accident .
do we believe that ?
as much as i believe aria being seared was an accident .
what do you think , spence ?
uh , two out of five in the er . that &apos;s 40 percent .
it &apos;s 60 if you count what happened to emily &apos;s eggs .
well , the odds aren &apos;t gonna get any better
the closer we get to election night .
three days .
hey , so ali &apos;s hospital is an hour away .
i think i &apos;m gonna go check up on her .
she says she &apos;ll be back tomorrow .
maybe she should think about going in the opposite direction .
yeah , check on her , but don &apos;t freak her out .
and it might be best if she stays away
until after the election .
hey , what do we do about mona ?
keep a close eye on her .
you guys , mona did not kill charlotte . she couldn &apos;t .
she &apos;s got as much motive as anybody . probably more .
she admits to getting charlotte out of her house .
i mean , she &apos;s telling the truth , just not all of it .
mona &apos;s changed so many times .
i doubt she even knows herself when she looks in the mirror .
okay , who around here hasn &apos;t tried
to reinvent themselves a couple of times ?
i &apos;ll call you after i go see ali .
uh , yeah , i will talk to aria about it .
but , um , i will certainly be there .
seven ? yeah , absolutely .
alright , bye @-@ bye .
check with aria about what ?
your boss wants to buy us dinner .
jillian ? wh @-@ where ? when ?
tonight . at the radley .
she was on her way to toronto .
through pennsylvania ?
yeah , uh , i think she wants to see what she &apos;s buying .
already ?
oh , no , not the book .
the authors .
don &apos;t worry about it .
this is new territory for me .
hey , you &apos;re doing great .
i may have dropped the ball .
what do you mean ?
i didn &apos;t get this right .
oh , this is the part where they say goodbye
where he drives off and looks back at her .
i thought you liked this .
yeah , i @-@ i liked it when we wrote it
but not so much when i read it .
is @-@ is it the part that i wrote ?
no @-@ no , it &apos;s , um ...
uh @-@ uh , i @-@ i set this up wrong .
alright , well , i @-@ i might be a little prejudiced .
but i think it &apos;s lovely .
yeah , it is .
okay , why don &apos;t you work on this ?
i &apos;ve got a lot to keep me busy .
um , just , at least figure out what &apos;s bothering you about it .
okay , i &apos;m gonna try something .
um , i &apos;m gonna do it in the other room .
so did you feel dizzy or anything ?
no , i felt fine .
all of a sudden , my feet were there
but the stairs weren &apos;t .
i &apos;m so sorry , ali .
it was just a stupid accident .
do you like my honeymoon lingerie ?
you look great .
hey , what are the doctors saying ?
they want me to stay because of the concussion
but they &apos;ll spring me tomorrow .
back to the bridal suite ?
back to rosewood .
elliott got a call for a conference in chicago .
they want him on the panel .
you &apos;re gonna be in rosewood by yourself ?
i don &apos;t mind .
for the first time ...
that house really feels like mine .
god , all these flowers .
did you fall down some stairs or enter the rose parade ?
elliott sent them .
all of them ?
he &apos;s working on his husband creds .
oh ! hi , newlywed .
hanna .
thank you so much for coming .
we stick together , you should know that by now .
these flowers are getting a little much .
well , that &apos;s the goal .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to take all these home .
well , we can distribute ...

i want you to see something .
is that who i think it is ?
sara harvey &apos;s helping hand .
what &apos;s mona doing with him ?
good question .
mona left him sitting on the bench .
couple minutes later he got up and went inside .
you didn &apos;t hear anything that she said to him ?
no , i was too far away .
but what is mona doing with sara &apos;s driver ?
well , i doubt she &apos;s asking him for a ride to the airport .
like a meeting of the minions .
yeah , could be .
did he go in there with that tube ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
i really wanna thank you for coming .
we weren &apos;t expecting it .
well , no one likes to be in a hospital
especially away from home .
um , this place is okay , is it ?
you mean the hospital ? yeah .
i checked out the staff . ali &apos;s getting the best .
i &apos;m probably overreacting a bit
but i figure that &apos;s part of my job now .
and her concussion , they &apos;re gonna check on her .
right ? they &apos;re not gonna leave her alone ?
they check on her and i &apos;m with her most of the time .
good .
i &apos;m just starting to understand how loyal you are to alison .
the way you look out for each other , it &apos;s remarkable .
yeah , well , we &apos;re all connected like a big bowl of linguini .
um , if she needs anything , call me .
i will .
let me go get my car .
no , just wait a minute .
now what ?
look , we can follow him around all day
but it &apos;s not gonna tell us what &apos;s inside that tube .
wait here . i &apos;ll be right back .
oh , my god . is this your car ? we are so sorry .
this is entirely my fault .
it &apos;s totally her fault . i was trying to park .
and she was talking to me . and we just crashed .
you were asking me a question and i was--
it &apos;s nothing . don &apos;t worry .
no , no , no , seriously .
no , no , no . i &apos;m taking full responsibility .
i feel terrible . she feels terrible .
just don &apos;t say it &apos;s okay if it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s really not . please .
will you just take a good look . i &apos;m willing to pay for it .
i just want you to take a good look and make sure
that there &apos;s no real damage done .
yeah , i mean , this is , like , my first accident ever
since i &apos;ve been driving for , like , a year and a half
and i just , i really wanna make sure
that you take a good look and tell me
that there &apos;s no real damage .
&apos;cause , you know , insurance and everything
地下室
can get a little expensive ...
i mean , i know how much my car means to me
and i &apos;m sure you feel the same way , and ...
hey , is this suit italian ?
it &apos;s really soft .
i &apos;d really like it if we could just solve this here
so we wouldn &apos;t have to drag it on .
it &apos;s nothing . i mean it . don &apos;t worry .
you have no idea how happy i am to hear you say that .
so sorry .
i &apos;m sorrier than she is .
have a good rest of your day .
bye .
bye !
do you think he remembered us ?
no , it didn &apos;t seem like it .
so did you find anything ?
yeah , all roads lead back to radley .
you &apos;re kidding .
you keep following our friend .
i &apos;m gonna go back to city hall and see if i can get
a copy of what &apos;s in that tube .
okay .
okay .
i thought i could go , but i can &apos;t . i &apos;m sorry .
no . no , no . but we @-@ we planned this .
i should have left yesterday , but i was waiting for you .
yeah , i know , but blanca is sick .
i said i &apos;d help with the kids , so ..
but blanca was taking care of those kids
a long time before we showed up .
yeah , i know , but , baby , i promised .
don &apos;t be selfish .
i @-@ i &apos;m not being selfish .
yeah , you are .
hey , what &apos;s wrong ?
i really wanted to take you to the coast .
to all the glamor that is lisiado bay ?
y @-@ y @-@ yeah , nicole , hot water
and a whole bathtub full of it .
o @-@ okay , it &apos;s really , really tempting
but i made a promise .
you &apos;ll be back in three days . don &apos;t be a baby .
don &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s just a phrase .
don &apos;t call me a baby when i just wanna
spend some time alone with you
in a room that has a lock and a floor .
ezra .
hey , i @-@ i have an idea .
just get in the jeep . just get in the jeep .
please , please just get in the jeep .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t or you won &apos;t ?
oh , come on . don &apos;t make it like that .
okay . yeah , forget it .
what , you gonna drive the next six hours angry at me ?
yeah , probably .
ezra , don &apos;t go like this .
if i don &apos;t leave now , i won &apos;t make it by nightfall .
seriously , don &apos;t go like this .
like what ?
okay , fine .
fine .
and i got in the jeep and left .
made a really big deal of grinding all the gears
so she would know i was still pissed off .
i drove away .
no wave , no last look .
so that &apos;s what really happened .
yeah . not very romantic , is it ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re a bad influence on me .
you make me want to be honest .
so , do we tell it the way it should &apos;ve been
or do we tell it the way it happened ?
we tell it the way that makes the best story .
tell me i &apos;m wrong about that .
did alison or elliott see this ?
i &apos;m pretty sure they didn &apos;t .
look , whoever this is is not gonna wait until election night .
they &apos;re gonna keep chipping away at us
until there &apos;s nothing left .
what did you tell the others about ali &apos;s accident ?
nothing ... yet .
i wanted to talk to you first .
why me ?
because you &apos;re the only one who can help me with this .
what are we talking about ?
look , i thought about this a lot on the drive home .
the only way to prevent any more accidents
is to call this creep &apos;s bluff .
we have to tell them we &apos;re ready to give them what they want .
hanna , what they want is charlotte &apos;s killer .
right . and that &apos;s who we give them .
well , he didn &apos;t go that far out of town to get ice cream .
no , sara just didn &apos;t want anybody seeing her get the key .
he probably checked in for her .
em , uh , let &apos;s do this in person , okay ?
bye .
hey . uh , i was gonna call you .
um ... did you see ali ?
is she okay ?
yeah , she &apos;s okay . um , it wasn &apos;t an accident .
sara &apos;s back at the radley .
when did that happen ?
today .
she checked in under a fake name
and she &apos;s still looking for something .
these are plans for the radley
same one sara got from the records office .
spence ... you need to listen to hanna .
that night , at the hotel , when you were asleep ..
i left the room .
i followed aria and ezra .
and i saw them in the square and then ..
i saw charlotte go into the church .
so i went in after her .
she was sitting there . alone . praying .
i picked up a candlestick ..
and i stabbed her
in the back of the neck with the end of it .
and then i took her to the bell tower and i threw her off .
i went to the hotel and pretended
like i was only gone for a minute to get ice .
stealing that security drive
wasn &apos;t because aria was on it .
it &apos;s because i &apos;m on it .
i murdered charlotte .
see ? she believed it .
and if she believed it even for a minute ..
what the hell just happened ?
hanna knows how we can end this .
i really shouldn &apos;t encourage aria &apos;s writing .
i was hoping to turn her into a world @-@ class editor .
well , you missed your chance . she &apos;s already a novelist .
almost .
i &apos;m curious about the process . how does it work with you two ?
we &apos;re still figuring that out .
really ? i was hoping you had it down by now .
i have a marketing department chomping at the bit .
well , we sort of , uh , spot the corners
of the mat for each other .
just somebody that the other person can trust .
makes it go a lot quicker than if we were alone .
quicker is good .
but we &apos;re still taking our time
to get it right .
we don &apos;t wanna rush it .
yeah .
a @-@ and i know that you &apos;ve been carrying
that advance for quite sometime--
i didn &apos;t come here to lean on you two .
i came here to buy you dinner and wish you well .
and maybe lean just a little .
i have production decisions to make for next year .
and i don &apos;t like making that kind of commitment
without a manuscript in my hand . even a rough one .
i need to see some kind of complete draft
and i need to see it soon .
oh , you &apos;ll have it .
good .
whole thing sounds crazy .
it &apos;s not crazy .
we &apos;re building a rat trap .
and you are the cheese .
we have to do something unexpected
to knock them off balance .
okay , so what if she confesses to killing charlotte , and a
orders her to march into the police station and tell tanner ?
you think this person went to all that trouble
just to hand it over to the cops ?
this is about revenge , not justice .
still sounds--
&apos;crazy . yes.&apos;
we &apos;ve established that , but caleb and i
have it all figured out .
what do you think about all this ?
i &apos;m just happy
somebody else has come up with a plan
&apos;cause i &apos;m all tapped out .
can it work ?
yeah . it can work .
meanwhile , i &apos;ll work things from the sara angle
and if we &apos;re lucky , we &apos;ll catch a.
if we &apos;re lucky .
hanna has the plan and caleb has the know @-@ how .
and if we don &apos;t back them up
they &apos;re just gonna do it by themselves .
is that true ?
yeah .
um , most of what i need i @-@ i can take off the shelf
but for the other stuff , i mean
it would really be helpful if i could talk to toby .
spence ?
he needs to know what you &apos;re planning .
and i wanna show him those blueprints .
hey , can i see that list ?
do you think hanna &apos;s aware of the risk she &apos;s taking ?
yeah , em , she knows .
and you &apos;re just gonna let the two of them run this ?
it &apos;s their plan . what do you want me to do ?
wedge myself in between them on the sofa ?
i @-@ i &apos;m a sort of a hip @-@ hop luddite &apos;
the thing they don &apos;t want you to know
is how ethereal the technology is .
i still think ink on acid @-@ free paper is gonna win out .
you don &apos;t mind if aria walks me home , do you ?
just to the elevators .
oh , no .
um , i &apos;ll meet you outside .
okay .
uh , jillian , thank you again for dinner .
thanks for the book .
i just want to let you know , from now on
you &apos;ll be communicating with my office directly .
you won &apos;t have to go through liam on this project .
but i @-@ i &apos;ve been working with liam the whole time .
i know . i had a talk with him when he came back .
it was clear to me he needed some distance . he agreed .
i think it &apos;s what &apos;s best for the book and everybody involved .
oh ... alright .
are you trying to pretend i don &apos;t know you and liam
are what used to be called &quot; an item ? &quot;
give me some credit , aria .
i guess we could &apos;ve been a little more discreet .
you were very discreet , that &apos;s why everybody knows .
i &apos;m depending on you to keep things in perspective
until the book is finished .
after that , you can do what you like with whomever you like .
but right now , i don &apos;t want this project derailed ... by anything .
i understand .
i hope so .
i like your ezra . he &apos;s smart .
and he can write , and the talk shows will love him .
they &apos;ll love both of you .
you and your ex @-@ teacher are in for quite a ride .
goodnight , aria .
goodnight ..
em ?
aria , are you still at dinner ?
hey , listen , you need to tell ezra what &apos;s happening .
i know , but the situation &apos;s changing .
i &apos;m at spencer &apos;s .
hanna wants to try something .
no , she just left with caleb .
you @-@ you need to hear this .
&apos;hanna wants to say that she killed .. &apos;
of all the paintings in that museum
why did you wanna take this one home ?
this little dog &apos;s been through a lot with me .
&apos;he was on a calendar in the kitchen&apos;
of one of my foster homes .
it was an old calendar , wrong year .
nobody ever took it down until i did .
this is actually the only thing i took with me .
i sort of made him my little dog .
you still have the print ?
i left it behind ... in new york .
well , your little dog is doing alright for himself .
he &apos;s hanging in prado
people are lining up to see him ..
... buying him in the gift shop .
yeah , sometimes things work out .
i really wanna say thank you for last night .
for all the adventures , the museums today
even the bull fight .
it was all very--
chaotic ?
no , it was impromptu .
where do you wanna go ?
for dinner ?
no , after madrid .
um ... i &apos;m not sure .
maybe morocco .
god , i envy you .
ferry ticket doesn &apos;t cost that much .
yeah , but i &apos;ve got to be back in georgetown
by the end of the month .
then we &apos;ll skip casablanca .
hey , it &apos;s 10 o &apos;clock .
time for dinner .
yeah .
alright , i &apos;ll be back as fast as i can
but , uh , the more i get done tonight
the less i have to worry .
right .
sorry , i just wanted to make sure that worked
from anywhere in the apartment .
hey , caleb . good to see you .
good to see you .
i would ask how you &apos;re doing , but i &apos;m a stockholder
so i already know .
yeah , well , confidence is high .
okay , um , i gotta go .
okay .
oh , do you lunch ? we should do lunch .
yeah , i lunch .
then we &apos;ll lunch .
okay . bye .
okay , you are completely safe .
thank you .
hey , what , what is this ?
it &apos;s the empty factory i &apos;m buying near the lake .
and this ... is what it &apos;s gonna look like when it &apos;s finished .
that &apos;s really nice . what are you gonna do with it ?
anything i want to .
what would you do with it ?
indoor miniature golf .
no , seriously , what would you do ?
if somebody said that you could try anything
you know , start your own business ..
what would you do ?
don &apos;t kid like that , lucas .
who &apos;s kidding ?
well , i would set myself up
with some new designers . start my own brand .
you know , get out of the city , away from all the distractions .
deal .
research and development .
it can mean whatever we say that it means .
look , this will be a good way for you
to keep one foot in rosewood .
figure out what you left behind .
lucas , i , i can &apos;t take you up on that offer .
why not ? what ?
does somebody else you went to high school with
wanna offer you a million @-@ dollar line of credit ?
come on , hanna .
look , i finally figured out a way to give you something
that nobody else can .
look , but the offer still stands .
ask jordan about it .
we can talk about it tomorrow or whenever you want .
yeah . tomorrow .
don &apos;t be afraid . please .
i don &apos;t wanna scare you .
i &apos;m dreaming .
or it &apos;s , it &apos;s the drugs or the concussion .
i don &apos;t care what it is .
i &apos;m just glad i &apos;m able to see you , to talk to you .
my little angel .
mommy .
everything &apos;s gonna be alright now .
elliott will take care of you .
you know about elliott .
i know he &apos;s a good man .
i know he loves you .
and he &apos;ll protect you the way that i wasn &apos;t able to .
rest , darling .
you &apos;ll be happy now .
someone told me you wanted to talk .
hello , sara .
i saw your driver this morning ,
i was curious how you were doing .
alright . everyone has their own personal way to survive .
well , when you consider what we &apos;ve all been through
it &apos;s amazing we &apos;re all functioning so well .
what do you want , mona ?
leave &apos; em alone .
not until i get what &apos;s coming to me .
charlotte &apos;s dead .
you can &apos;t get reparations from a corpse .
you can if you know where to dig .
be careful .
no one blames you for what charlotte made you do
but what you do now , that &apos;s all yours .
poor mona , out in the cold .
no matter what you do , they &apos;re never gonna trust you .
you played with them too long .
i &apos;m not playing anything anymore , okay ? no more games .
then you &apos;re gonna be awfully lonely .
well , so far i kinda like your boss .
although i can see how she can be a bit daunting .
jillian has daunt she hasn &apos;t even used yet .
what did you guys talk about in the lobby ?
that was work related .
she wants me to go through the office , not liam .
what else ?
nothing . really .
then why have you not looked me in the eye
since we left the hotel ?
it &apos;s not about the book .
emily called me .
is something wrong ?
alison &apos;s in the hospital .
is she back ? what happened ?
no , she &apos;s not back .
she &apos;s still away with elliott .
is she gonna be okay ?
yeah .
she had an accident , or what looked like an accident .
the same way that what happened to me looked like an accident .
a ... aria , w @-@ what are you saying exactly ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s happening again
and we &apos;re gonna do something about it .
i didn &apos;t wanna wake you .
that &apos;s alright . i was dreaming .
i came in with good news .
we can go home in the morning . all tests are clear .
that &apos;s good .
and i made up my mind to cancel chicago .
no , you have to go . it &apos;s important .
you &apos;re important .
really , i &apos;m gonna be okay now .
i mean it .
go to the conference , so that when you get back
i can welcome you at the door and we can have a life .
what happened to you ?
nothing .
everything .
i had a dream , that &apos;s all .
what was in the dream ?
i don &apos;t wanna tell you .
it &apos;ll sound silly .
well , i don &apos;t care what it was ...
as long as it made you happy .
and you can get all that ready in time ?
i &apos;ve already started it . i can have it when we need it .
are you sure you wanna do this ?
i wouldn &apos;t have thought of it if i wasn &apos;t ready to do it .
look , guys , this isn &apos;t a democracy , okay ?
we &apos;re not taking votes .
this is something that hanna and i decided to do .
and the only thing that you need to decide is
whether or not you &apos;re gonna help us .
nobody here is gonna let you do this by yourself .
alright . so let &apos;s get started .
