i gotta tell you , the more i read about the
primordial gravity wave discovery , the more excited i get .
i know . being an astrophysicist right now
is like being a rock star .
only without the sex .
yeah , literally , none of it .
what do you think about it , sheldon ?
meh .
are you kidding me ? this may be
the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime .
how can you , as a theoretical physicist ,
not care about this ?
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;m not an elitist .
what i &apos;d like to know is :
how does this gravity wave breakthrough
help the man on the street ? you know ?
wh @-@ who &apos;s looking out for joe six @-@ pack
and all his quantum physics concerns ?
oh , my god , you &apos;re jealous .
why would i be jealous ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven ,
the higgs field just got proven
and you &apos;ve been working on string theory
for the last 20 years and you &apos;re no closer to proving it
than when you started .
yeah , well , i &apos;ve had a lot on my plate .
we happen to live in a golden age of television .
excuse me , fellas .
sorry for eavesdropping ,
but there actually was some big string theory news today
out of the hadron collider .
really ?
did they find evidence to support extra dimensions
or supersymmetry ?
no ,
but they did find evidence that you &apos;ll believe anything .
why would you do that ?
you &apos;re a string theorist as well .
incorrect . i am a string pragmatist .
i say i &apos;m gonna prove something that cannot be proved ,
i apply for grant money ,
and then i spend it on liquor and broads .
later .
do you think he &apos;s right ?
am i wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven ?
maybe . but how great is game of thrones ?
hey , you &apos;re up early .
i couldn &apos;t sleep .
i told you those walking dead pillowcases were a bad idea .
no , that &apos;s not it .
is something bothering you ?
yes , but you wouldn &apos;t understand .
oh , come on , try me .
all right .
i &apos;ve devoted the prime of my life to string theory
and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions .
i &apos;ve got nothing to show for it , and i feel like a fool .
okay . i get it .
i mean , not all the jibberjabber in the middle , but ...
i know what it &apos;s like
to put your heart and soul into something
and get nothing out of it .
you mean your acting career ?
no .
your relationship with leonard ?
no .
your failed attempt to go back to college ?
no !
i &apos;m saying you and string theory sound like a relationship ,
and i know what it &apos;s like to be in one
and realize it &apos;s never gonna turn out the way you want .
i said leonard ; you said no .
i &apos;m talking about other guys .
okay .
well , what do you do ?
you have to have the courage to end the relationship .
you know ? break it off , shake hands , walk away .
i don &apos;t know if i can do that .
i know it &apos;s hard , honey ,
but in the end , that &apos;s how you grow .
penny , have you seen my good inhaler ?
break it off , shake hands , walk away .
hey , how &apos;s dating two women going ?
um , kind of hit a bump .
when i was honest and told emily
she wasn &apos;t the only person i was seeing , it went great .
so i tried the same thing with lucy .
and ?
she had mixed feelings .
but when i said , &quot; emily was cool with it .
emily &apos;s the best . why can &apos;t you be more like emily ? ... &quot;
... those feelings became less mixed .
women . who knows what &apos;ll set &apos; em off ?
at least now i can focus all my energies on just one girl .
i hope i get to meet her as soon as possible .
why the rush ? she isn &apos;t going anywhere .
she is . but i like that attitude .
gentlemen , is anybody interested in my old string theory books ?
you &apos;re really going to do this ?
i am . yeah , penny pointed out that
what i &apos;m going through is essentially a breakup .
and according to cosmopolitan magazine ,
one of the most effective techniques for moving on
is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship .
you &apos;re reading cosmo ?
yes .
as it turns out , there &apos;s an article
on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue .
anyway ,
it suggests that i set these on fire ,
but the smell of burning books
reminds me of church picnics in east texas .
what &apos;s this ?
that &apos;s just a doodle of a hyperelliptic riemann surface .
oh , yeah . wasn &apos;t that the basis of your postdoc fellowship ?
it was .
this seemed so elegant at the time ,
but ... now i realize i was just a simple country boy
seduced by a big city theory
with variables in all the right places .
it &apos;s going to be okay .
i know .
as hard as this is , i have to move on .
i can &apos;t keep postulating multidimensional entities
and get nothing in return .
i have needs , too .
so , you and emily still together ?
i spoke to bernadette . she &apos;s free tomorrow night .
oh , okay , great .
but if we &apos;re really gonna do a double date ,
then we have to go over some ground rules about emily .
like when it turns out she &apos;s made of rubber ,
i don &apos;t say anything ?
she &apos;s very real .
oh , that &apos;s what it says on the box .
right next to &quot; dishwasher safe . &quot;
see ?
this is exactly the kind of thing
i &apos;m worried about you saying in front of her .
i promise i &apos;ll be on my best behavior .
you better be .
no jokes about how close i am with my dog .
or the truth about how close i am with my dog .
you got it .
no jokes about the year i took ballet .
you took ballet ?
god , you never listen .
are you sure you want to do this ?
the magazine articles suggest that one of the ways
to get over a breakup is a new look .
what about your old look ,
well @-@ groomed ventriloquist doll ?
&quot; oh , my god , i do look like that . &quot;
stop it !
so , how do you want me to cut it ?
how about bill gates meets nikola tesla ?
so , business in the front , science in the back .
or i don &apos;t cut it
and maybe just style it a little .
oh , i &apos;m in your hands .
do a good job and i &apos;ll tell you cosmo &apos;s ten dynamite tips
to enjoy your pms .
can you keep him quiet ?
maybe jangle some keys in front of him ?
that doesn &apos;t work anymore .
he just thinks i &apos;m taking him to the doctor .
so , now that you &apos;re no longer invested in string theory ,
what are you gonna pursue ?
oh , there are so many exciting areas :
black holes , dark matter ...
oh , leonard was telling me about dark matter ,
but i didn &apos;t really understand it .
don &apos;t feel bad . neither does he .
okay ...
what do you think ?
have you ever even seen a picture of tesla ?
发型是微卷的中分头
it actually looks good , sheldon .
doesn &apos;t it ?
yeah .
i suppose i could see myself in a scientific boy band .
of course , i &apos;d be the dreamy one and the smart one .
sorry i &apos;m late .
what did you do ?
i gave him a new look . it &apos;s cute , huh ?
yeah , it &apos;s cute . that &apos;s the problem .
i don &apos;t need other girls to see him walking around
like sex on a stick .
she &apos;s right . i &apos;m too hot .
i &apos;m excited to meet emily .
me , too . i just hope he doesn &apos;t blow it .
why would you say that ?
because he &apos;s raj-- that &apos;s his thing .
beckham can bend it , ralph can wreck it ,
raj can blow it .
与 《 wreck it ralph 》 无敌破坏王
look , i don &apos;t want it to happen ,
but odds are he &apos;s gonna find a way to ...
oh , crap , i know that girl .
how ?
in a bad way , very bad .
hey , guys .
whatever you hear tonight , just remember i love you .
hey !
emily , these are my good friends ,
howard and bernadette .
guys , this is emily .
nice to meet you .
hi .
have we met before ?
uh ... no .
i @-@ i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t ... think so .
you sure ? you look familiar .
well , you sure don &apos;t .
you i know , you i know , you ?
total stranger .
even if you had yummy candy , i would not get in your van .
did you go to that spin class on green street ?
that must be it .
since when do you go to spin class ?
wow . now who doesn &apos;t listen ?
sheldon , your food &apos;s getting cold .
what are you doing ?
oh , looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry .
why do we have a geology book ?
leonard ,
did you throw a children &apos;s party while i was in texas ?
wait . what &apos;s wrong with geology ?
let me put this in a way you &apos;ll understand , penny .
you remember how you explained to me
that the kardashians aren &apos;t real celebrities ?
well , geology is the kardashians of science .
have you considered studying standard model physics ?
you want me to give up string theory
for something that &apos;s less advanced ?
you know , why don &apos;t you break up with penny
and start dating a brown bear ?
like you could get a brown bear .
hey , i &apos;ve got a good job .
i could buy salmon . you don &apos;t know .
maybe you could make your new field of study
the calculation of nuclear matrix elements .
oh , please .
if i wanted to take up a fad , i &apos;d get a tramp stamp .
what about loop quantum gravity ?
oh , duchess , look at me .
my quantum gravity &apos;s positively loopy .
who &apos;s the duchess ?
one of the people that lives in his head .
i hope he &apos;s this distraught if he ever breaks up with me .
well , if he does , i &apos;ll see if my bear has a friend .
sheldon , have you ever considered
not rushing into something new ?
i mean , why don &apos;t you take your time ,
enjoy your freedom ?
maybe something new to study will find you .
that &apos;s actually not bad advice .
you know , i didn &apos;t seek out string theory .
it just hit me over the head one day .
how does that happen ?
a bully chased me through the school library
and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find .
okay , how about we toast your newfound freedom ?
ah , normally i refrain from alcohol ,
but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs ,
why not soak it in grape juice
that &apos;s been predigested by a fungus ?
and you wonder why other children beat you with books .
cheers !
emily , what do you do ?
i &apos;m a dermatology resident at huntington hospital .
mmm , and you know what that means .
someone &apos;s skin &apos;s about to be softer than ever .
this is making me crazy .
i know i know you from somewhere .
oh , uh , howard was an astronaut .
maybe that &apos;s where you saw him .
that &apos;s amazing .
what was that like ?
it was the most incredible experience of my life .
up there in the space station , you &apos;re ...
oh , my god , i remember .
can i finish my astronaut story ?
it was four years ago .
please don &apos;t say it .
we were set up on a blind date .
please don &apos;t say it .
you came to my apartment .
you &apos;re saying it .
well , wh @-@ what happened ?
yeah , what happened ?
okay , i &apos;ll say it .
i was on the way to pick her up .
my stomach felt a little funny .
when i got there , i asked if i could use her bathroom .
please don &apos;t say it .
one roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later ,
i was so humiliated ,
i snuck out the window and never saw her again .
you know what else i never saw again--
my security deposit .
i &apos;m sorry .
i tried to unclog it , but you didn &apos;t have a plunger ,
and water was spilling out everywhere .
right , just water .
look , i have felt terrible about this for years ,
and i &apos;m glad i have the opportunity
to tell you just how sorry i am .
it &apos;s fine .
all my friends love this story .
they call you clogzilla .
get it ?
because you clogged up her bathroom
like a radioactive monster !
yeah , yeah , i get it .
howie .
well , hey , it &apos;s not like cotton candy comes out of you .
come on , let &apos;s get you to bed .
you &apos;ve had a lot to drink .
no more than penny .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m saying .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
empty room .
empty room .
empty room .
if somebody says &quot; come in , &quot; i &apos;m gonna freak out .
so , emily ,
why did you decide to specialize in dermatology ?
i like cutting people with knives ,
and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
she &apos;s scary , but it &apos;s a cute scary .
can i say just one more thing ?
i had some kind of food poisoning that day .
sure , in retrospect , gas station sushi--
maybe not the best choice .
nor was climbing out your window and running away .
but i think we can all understand how humiliating that was ,
and i &apos;d really appreciate it if we could move on .
howie , we moved on a long time ago .
i &apos;m just saying ... - we moved on .
okay . fine .
how &apos;s your soup ?
ah , it &apos;s all right .
they could &apos;ve filled the bowl a little more .
excuse me .
where are you going ?
i need some fresh air .
been there .
oh , no .
what have i done ?
how you feeling ?
not so good .
are you gonna introduce me to your friend ?
it &apos;s not my friend .
nothing happened .
i don &apos;t know . i heard you reading pretty loud last night .
oh , dear lord .
where &apos;s amy ?
after she put you to bed , she went home .
i should call her and apologize .
oh , no .
what ?
apparently , i called stephen hawking last night .
first new message .
hawkman !
it &apos;s your old buddy sheldonoscopy !
how come you didn &apos;t pick up the phone ? !
oh , right . my bad .
you &apos;re awful quiet . everything okay ?
not really .
i had a bit of an embarrassing evening .
ugh . me , too . what happened ?
i drank alcohol
and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for stephen hawking .
i wouldn &apos;t worry about it .
he &apos;s got a pretty good sense of humor .
oh , i hope so .
what happened to you last night ?
oh , well , turns out
i &apos;d already met the girl raj is seeing
when i did a number on her bathroom .
and that number was two .
well , you know , i &apos;ve always been a fan
of a story told by attar of nishapur ,
about a king
who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring
that would make him happy when he was sad .
and that ring
was inscribed with the phrase , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
hey , cooper !
oh , my god .
i heard you drunk @-@ dialed stephen hawking last night ?
classic !
get out of here , barry .
whatever you say ...
clogzilla .
clogzilla . that &apos;s pretty funny .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna pass .
next message .
it &apos;s me again !
i gave up string theory .
you should give up black holes ,
and we can totally solve crimes together !
next message .
do you know what &apos;s great ? !
geology .
look at this geode !
that &apos;s fun to say !
gee ... ode ! gee ... ode !
next message .
gee ... ode !
gee ... ode !
i kiss girls now .
next message .
hey , guess who i am !
beep bop boop bop !
i &apos;m you ! get it ? !
next message .
are you mad at me ?
oh , no , you &apos;re mad at me .
i &apos;m so sorry !
beep bop boop bop .
next message .
thiospinel sulfide . thiospinel sulfide .
that &apos;s even more fun than &quot; gee ... ode . &quot;
hey , did you see the lego movie ?
what a jackass .
