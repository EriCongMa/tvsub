放马过来吧
Now pull it in, run it back. Let's go.
Come on.
I gotcha.
On swat, we broke shots down into 3 steps.
One-front sight.
Focus on the front sight, not on the target.
2- controlled trigger press.
3- follow through.
After the shot, you come right back to the target.
Now what did you do wrong?
I didn't follow through.
Right. You came off the target to see where you hit.
Hotch, my firearms qualification is tomorrow morning.
I barely passed my last one.
Front sight, trigger press...
follow through.
You do those 3 things, you'll hit your target every time.
I'm not fallin' for it.
Come on, pop.
Stop playing.
Oh, my God.
Dad!
Did Elle teach you that?
They're gonna take away my gun.
A profiler is not required to carry.
Yeah? And yet you carry 2 of them.
吉迪恩告诉我
"you don't have to carry a gun to kill someone."
I don't get it.
You will.
Good luck tomorrow.
Reid failed his qualification.
He can re-test in 2 weeks.
Yeah, but he's gonna be embarrassed about it, so let's not mention it.
Yeah, let's not.
Not a word.
We're all here for you.
I'm serious.
If you ever need anything...
Just blow on that.
德斯普兰斯的弗兰克林公园
3 victims shot at distance.
It's the third such shooting in 2 weeks.
A sniper?
We don't use that word.
Why not?
The public perception is that the FBI
doesn't have an exemplary record with snipers.
这些人显然不是
What do we call 'em then?
L.D.S.K.
Long distance serial killers.
How many of these guys have we caught using a profile?
None.
六名受害人都是腹部中枪
也是唯一一名死者亨利·萨克斯
married, father of 3,
was shot in a shopping center parking lot.
9 days later,
在社区中心打篮球时遇害
Franklin park, 4 days later,
凯特·默里和蒂姆·赖利
在受害人间未发现任何关联
Ballistics?
击中时会爆炸为碎片
making ballistics comparisons impossible.
The good news is that all the park victims are gonna make it.
The bad new is that none of them saw anything.
留下了一颗完整的子弹
What's the prognosis?
There's a disagreement among surgical staff
前提下取出子弹
Well, without a useful witness or a solid piece of forensic evidence...
The profile's all we'll have.
Nietzsche wrote,
"The irrationality of a thing
"is not an argument against it's existence,
rather, a condition of it."
L.D.S.K.S are so rare,
we haven't been able to build a standard profile.
Here's what we do know: they're always male,
and they frequently have law enforcement or military experience,
and they always contact the police or the media.
To take credit or relive the experience?
Both.
都试图重温杀戮的快感
Some use souvenirs taken from the victims,
and others return to the dump site to interact with the body.
Both modes require contact with the victim,
对于远距射击连环杀手并不存在
留下了一张塔罗牌
由此终落法网
But our unsub hasn't contacted anybody.
He will.
我们现在掌握什么情况
根据不明嫌犯的所为而作
Sometimes it is what they do not do.
He doesn't kill his victims.
Underkill's a unique signature.
The question is,
是否只是为伤害他们
or is he just aiming at the biggest part of the target?
不明嫌犯是枪法不好才不选择爆头
or simply the will to take it?
Agent Hotchner.
这位是摩根探员和里德探员
Thanks for comin'. Follow me.
The cones mark the places where the victims were.
So we know he fired from somewhere in this area.
Close enough to hit all 3 victims,
but far away enough not to be seen.
His wounding his victims intentionally
would classify him as a sadistic killer.
That would help us?
We know a lot about sadists.
以便看清受害人的痛苦状
在安全范围观察一切了
So how do we determine if he's a sadist?
用换位思考分析他
We let him tell us.
Come on, Barry, you don't know that!
Good morning, doctors.
Forgive us. We were just reviewing the cases at hand.
尼尔·尔斯塔奇医生
and our trauma specialist, Dr. Barry Landman.
詹若和格凌威探员
How are you?
Forgive me. I don't shake.
My hands, you understand?
Of course.
So as psychological profilers, what exactly are you looking for?
How the victims were shot.
That could reveal the shooter's signature behavior.
碎片又向不同方向炸开
You can see the trauma's extensive.
You performed the surgeries?
On patient Miller.
是跟兰德曼医生讨论的
The intact slug lodged between the L4-L5 vertebrae.
病人很可能就瘫痪了
In your opinion.
In my opinion.
Disagree?
With the right surgeon, there is no risk.
There's always risk.
What significance does the bullet have in building a profile?
Well, even if we can't get a ballistics match,
we can get a rifle type,
and the specific type of rifle the suspect uses,
that could be very significant to the profile.
兰德曼医生
I know I can.
This handicapped spot couldn't be
further away from the entrance to the building.
Yeah?
正好包括了3个受害者和旗杆
What are you thinkin'?
At this range, the unsub would have to factor in
wind direction and speed as he shot.
To do this, he needed a spot
with the widest field of fire
从而推断风力如何影响每次射击
He came here before the shooting,
decided this was his spot...
and ensured that it would be empty when he came back.
My guess is he's shooting from his car.
Well, that would mean he wanted to get away from here quickly,
that he didn't stick around to watch his victims suffer.
So he would not be a sadist.
What would he be?
A very smart, very resourceful, very paranoid sociopath.
If I'm the unsub,
到3点15之间开枪伤人
That's when I'd do it. There are fewer cops on the street.
那时街上警察最少
Why is that?
以保证始终有人在执勤
第一班3点半才结束
Wouldn't there be twice as many cops on the street at that time?
In theory.
最初半小时需要点名
You're not on the street.
And the last half-hour, you're at the station.
You're finishin' reports, you're booking prisoners,
so the 25 minutes around the first/second shift,
that's a bad guy's golden window.
How many people outside law enforcement would know that?
而你已经想到了这点
I had considered it.
Hope you find it useful.
Dr. Landman?
How's Mr. Middleton.
Patient will make a full recovery...
Radiology is set up to take photos
and e-mail them out for consults.
我们得把子弹交给加西亚
Fill him in on the shift change theory.
Give me a second.
Yeah. Morgan.
Isn't this spooky?
Isn't what spooky?
That right now you were thinking about me,
and out of the blue, your phone rings?
And it's me. Huh?
How's that for a spiritual connection?
Um... do I know you?
Why do you hurt me?
告诉我你确定了嫌犯的地理侧写吧
Ok, I'll give you the good news first,
which is not that good, but it's better than the bad.
执法部门内部的工作程序
Detective Calvin,
how far out of your jurisdiction was crime scene number 2?
为什么问这个
If he knew how difficult it is
for local police departments to interact with each other,
he may have intentionally crossed jurisdiction lines.
Y'all are sayin' the shooter's a cop.
We're saying it's a possibility.
进行侦察并做好准备
He chose and elevated position with excellent enfilade
and perfect field of fire.
That's textbook military practice.
True.
Yeah, but maybe he was in the army.
或是其他特种部队
属于M-16枪的变型M-4
All the services use an M-4.
It's got a shorter barrel than the M-16.
而且射击的难度更大
especially at these distances.
他曾受过专业训练
If he has specialized training,
he knows exactly what he's doing.
He intended to wound them.
The underkill is deliberate.
Everything he does is deliberate,
他自己有多聪明
Since the crime scenes aren't centered around one single location,
加西亚无法完成地理侧写
What kind of data?
More crime scenes.
She's gonna get 'em.
This guy's got something to prove.
How did it play out?
He's been suspended
but my guess is that the school board's gonna go after him,
and they're gonna try to expel him.
I don't feel very good.
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room, ok?
Ok.
Honey, you have something on your dress.
Three more victims with nonfatal wounds,
and it's only been 48 hours since the last shooting.
The media attention and the FBI presence
will only escalate his desire to shoot again.
Meaning?
This is gonna get much worse.
Then we need to give the police a profile immediately.
You ready?
State troopers.
This is the second time he's crossed jurisdictions.
但他们不会喜欢的
This initial profile is not ready to be given to the media.
Releasing this profile prematurely can get people killed.
We're looking for a 30 to 40-year-old male veteran,
又不至于大到引人注意
可能是一辆经改装的轿车
还有射击时发出的声音
The unsub suffers from both narcissistic and paranoid personality disorders.
He works out obsessively and is never without a weapon.
He's completely self-centered and cannot empathize with others.
Incapable of admitting fault,
he blames his shortcomings on those around him.
He has no friends,
and his career history has been marked by frequent job changes.
为的是向低估了他的世人
to a world he perceives has undervalued him,
就是他需求的最终表现形式
We believe he changes jurisdictions intentionally
and strikes during the first/second shift change,
indicating and intimate knowledge of law enforcement.
You're saying he's one of us.
或者现在是一个警察
Is he driving a white van, too?
Enough.
That'll be all for now.
We can talk in my office.
Thank you.
Sergeant Weigart, we would like to
reenact the third shooting during the shift change.
Why?
Well, to better understand his M.O.
How does he get there? How does he leave?
What's the traffic like?
It could help us with witnesses.
Maybe the victims or bystanders saw something,
but don't realize the significance of what they saw.
All right, let's do it.
How you holdin' up?
Look at me. Without a gun on my belt, I look like a teacher's assistant.
You're not worried about how you look.
Hotch told me that when he came to the BAU,
you told him he didn't need a gun to kill somebody?
Well, the only truly effective weapon we have
is our ability to do the one thing they can't.
Which is what?
Empathize.
我们对凶手人性关怀
You're just saying that to convince me I don't need to carry a gun.
I don't care you carry a gun or not.
是一份精确而完备的犯罪行为分析
Of course you believe that.
Footpath Killer, he had a shotgun in the back of my head.
I'm here, he's not.
Elle, Jerry Middleton was facing a little further south.
Can you give us that?
How's that?
Perfect. Hold your camera right there.
It doesn't look like Jerry Middleton had a clear view
没有很清晰的视野
The tree branches were in the way.
I do have a clear view of the vehicle from here.
也能一览无余
Good. Have the unsub pop the trunk.
See if Reid can see it.
No, sorry.
Nothing from position one.
Ok, everyone, move to position 2.
约翰·詹金斯那里
reporting live from Franklin Park
with breaking news on the sniper investigation.
You gotta see this.
已告知警方特遣部队
德斯普兰斯警方的一员
Who could have leaked this?
The only people who had the profile were your people.
And the profile implicates them.
Why would a cop leak sensitive information
that would not only implicate one of his own,
but make every citizen in the county
afraid to get pulled over?
What does he get out of it?
Contact with the media.
What?
The cop who leaked this story is a good suspect.
闹下去的一种变态手段
Vic, why don't you go ahead and call the station
and find out what they've got in mind for one of the later shows.
Mr. Jenkins,
I'm special agent Jennifer Jareau with the FBI.
We need you to identify your source.
No way. I know my rights.
Hey, hey, shoot this. Vic, shoot this. Get this all on tape.
把这些枪击案视为恐怖袭击
我们想扣押你多久都行
All I know is his cell number.
We have a lead.
Rainmaker. How wet do you want it?
It's Hotch. I have a cell phone number,
and I need the name on the account.
实时的地址 免费服务
Are you ready?
I was born ready.
Can't you pull your people out of the park?
If we do and the shooter is here,
he'll sense something is wrong.
He could start shooting.
批量购买的其中之一
I need a name, Garcia.
我得从他们系统里调出来
Then give me the location.
Franklin Park, Des Plaines.
He's here.
The name, Garcia.
McCarty, Scott.
Scott McCarty.
McCarty's the unsub.
Teah. Where is he?
McCarty is playing the unsub.
We need to talk to Scott McCarty.
He's the leak.
McCarty. Why am I not surprised?
I need SWAT in the lot asap.
It's McCarty. We need to come heavy.
We didn't say he was the shooter.
让他到这来
Best case, he leaked the story.
我不能让他放倒任何我的人
We come heavy, and we take him clean.
This is McCarty. What's goin' on?
把双手伸出车外
I don't understand.
We know what you did, Scotty.
Look, I can explain.
Don't make me give the order!
Ok, all right! All right!
Now open the trunk lid slowly.
Come on.
That's it.
Everything is secure.
Get him up.
Get down!
How did McCarty end up playing the unsub?
在侧写简报时多嘴
during the profile briefing by making him the unsub
and sticking him in the trunk of the car all afternoon.
这次模拟的
Come on. Cops talk.
Pissed-off cops talk loud-
唯恐天下不知
What do we know?
Our unsub went from wounding civilians
to executing a police officer,
so he's escalated.
He's not staying on script.
Sometimes it's what they don't do.
He did not pick McCarty at random.
He didn't take the gut shot.
Why?
He wants to send a message.
"Nobody takes credit for my work."
Yes, sir. His ego won't allow it.
He feels underappreciated.
Ok, but we still don't know why he wounds them.
Excuse me.
We know if the killer has no contact with his victims,
he will contact the media.
But he hasn't contacted the media.
He has contact with his victims.
And there's only one way.
All right, thanks.
Garcia nailed down the geographic profile.
The crime scenes are centered on 2 separate locations.
The hospitals.
I believe it's a case of hero homicide.
What's that?
是医院护士理查德·安吉洛
He would inject toxins into his victims,
then wait for them to crash
so that he could run to the rescue and save them.
He killed 25 people, and that's just what we know of.
If he attacked 'em to save 'em,
why'd he kill 25 people?
Wasn't very good at it.
弥留之际病人的档案
So what's the profile on one of these guys?
Arrogant, conceited, feels superior to everyone around them.
You've just described every surgeon I've ever met.
Uh, forgive me. I don't shake.
My hands, you understand.
Of course.
Landman.
Let's start with Landman.
Call Weigart and tell him we need a discreet perimeter around this block.
I'm gonna go check out Landman's car.
Ok. Courtesy of Garcia.
曾就读于宪兵学校
Well, there's your law enforcement.
But he was smart,
got a degree on Uncle Sam,
and ended up a doctor with special forces
就辗转多家医院就职
Has Dr. Landman been under any unusual strain?
Has he had a reprimand?
Has he had any kind of major blow to his ego?
Last month, he was passed over for chief of surgery.
看是否有那凶器
Ok.
What can I do to help?
You can tell me where he is right now.
Where's Marston?
She's not coming.
Look, I'm very busy right now. Perhaps you could make an appointment.
Busy with what?
Things.
What kind of things?
You're considering me a suspect?
Yes.
Well, that's disconcerting.
I heard what happened to your last suspect.
Do you wanna know why?
Collective incompetence?
Have you ever heard of hero homicide?
Would I be less suspicious if I let my patients die?
Absolutely.
You get anything from his car?
It's a red 2-seat Maserati.
Heh. Of course.
If he's the shooter, he has another vehicle.
This type of killer seeks the power over life and death
and covets the power of God.
You know anyone like that?
I want you to understand something.
When my patients are in the operating room, they need God,
and that's exactly what I give them.
When someone's holding your beating heart in their hands,
who do you want holding it, me or God?
Where were you today at 3:00?
I was in my office.
Alone?
I was in my office with Dr. Hannah Pate.
I'm not the only one who thinks I'm a God.
She's in the E.R. right now.
Go on.
Ask her.
Great. Let's take a walk down to the E.R.
会为兰德曼做不在场证明
You don't think Landman's the shooter?
Richard Angelo wanted to be a hero
他是个无名小卒
他有能力和认可度
Yeah, but you know, surgeons are a different breed.
但兰德曼轮不上
Excuse me.
I'd like to speak with Dr. Pate.
Yes, sir. I'll go find her for you.
寻求刺激 力量和博得尊敬
但他仍会受到尊敬
Racing against the clock to save someone's life is exciting.
But maybe it's not exciting enough.
That's-that's why he shoots 3 people at a time.
But he can only operate on one at a time.
It wouldn't be any more exciting.
也不在急诊室
The policemen and E.R. personnel are on the exact same 24-hour shift schedule.
The unsub wasn't shooting at shift change
because there are fewer cops on the street.
He works the second shift in the emergency room.
Contact with the victims.
Sir, you can't use the cell phone in the hospital.
Excuse me, please.
We're FBI agents,
and we believe that one of your staff members might be the sniper.
The man we're looking for works second shift,
and he would have transferred from Arlington about 2 weeks ago.
We haven't hired any new personnel in 2 months.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
He has the worst narcissistic personality disorder I've ever seen,
but he's not our guy.
Look, I've got patients who need me.
He's in his thirties.
工作上很卖力
He shows up to work late.
He blames others for his mistakes,
doesn't take responsibility for his behavior.
All of his coworkers detest him.
It's Phillip Dowd.
He's-he picks up shifts at Arlington.
Is he here today?
Oh, my God.
Ok, your patients need you clam.
Tell me, is Dowd working today?
Do you see him?
Go tell Gideon.
Reid. Easy.
Nobody moves, and nobody dies.
Better be a head shot.
I got this on full auto.
我就能接着开枪
Get up!
Get over here!
Double time! Let's go!
You, take your partner's gun, put it on the counter.
He's not armed.
See for yourself.
Hands on your heads.
Get up, Keith.
Put those on 'em.
Now put 'em on yourself.
Now step back.
Back up. Back up. Back up.
Get down on the ground.
Have a seat.
Now, what kind of an FBI agent doesn't carry a gun?
I'm a profiler.
Profiler?
They sent you to figure me out.
We did. That's how we found you.
Shut up. Reid.
No, don't shut up.
Tell me what you think you know about me.
Go ahead, genius. Tell him.
Tell him.
But remember, get it wrong, and he's gonna kill you.
Ok.
You're the boss. You tell me.
Who am I?
What's my plan?
枪击11人却不留任何蛛丝马迹
却还能全身而退
and I know your plan is to go down in a hail of bullets.
What else do you know?
He joined the army at 18, went to ranger school,
did 6 years before being dishonorably discharged in '95 for conduct unbecoming,
obviously lied about it
joined the Arlington P.D.
You were right. He was a cop.
For 9 months.
When they found out he lied about the discharge
they kicked him out.
Soon thereafter, Dowd got his nursing license.
He's been bouncing from hospital to hospital ever since.
都是最出类拔萃的
and no one's ever known it.
People feel threatened by you and
try to sabotage you every chance they get.
You're not a bad person.
You help save all of your victims afterwards.
First guy wasn't your fault.
If the EMTs had been there on time,
he would've lived.
13分钟啊
You want to barricade the door.
What?
Let me and the kid do it.
Let 'em see that you've got 2 FBI agents
in here doing your bidding.
Right, let you give them a signal.
What signal? They knew you were in here.
They knew you were armed. What can I tell them?
What is this, some sort of profiler trick?
New negotiation tactic?
I think it's a good idea.
Why would you wanna help me?
I don't.
You said they knew I was in here.
I said they know you're in here.
No. That's not what you said.
Why does it matter?
It matters because your partner wants to help me
even though he doesn't know it.
Go ahead, boss man.
Tell him why.
一枪毙了你
They knew he was in here,
they knew he was armed and dangerous,
and they knew that he was gonna fight till the last round,
and they sent me in here with an unarmed kid
who can't shoot his way out of a wet paper bag.
They set you up.
就在嘲笑我呢
That's why you wanna help me.
I wouldn't say I want to help you,
but when they come in here to get revenge for the cop you killed,
you're gonna go down fighting,
and in the crossfire, a lot of us are gonna die.
They sent me in here. I figure why make it easy for them.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Please don't send your men in yet.
You have to consider the possibility that
your men are dead or at least disarmed.
Agent Hotch is a very experienced profiler.
让道尔德喜欢 相信并放他们一马
And once he does...
he'll get Dowd to end this peacefully.
I- I just... ask that you give him time.
Dowd's already shot 10 people.
He killed a cop.
The cop is dead.
This man is a violent, deranged paranoid.
It's a game.
什么都干得出来
You send in your men,
they're just gonna become villains in his little hero fantasy.
You're lettin' him call all the shots.
How are your unarmed men gonna stop him?
They're not unarmed.
They have his profile.
They understand him.
那之后我们将拿下急诊室
Your men... have 3 minutes.
You know why they took away boy genius's gun?
Why?
He failed his qualification.
我都得听他抱怨重考的事情
So I tutor him...
and he fails again.
You think you got it rough?
只会不断陷害我
Put him next to the barricade.
That way, when they blast their way in here
both of our problems are solved.
That sort of thing can ruin a cop's career.
You are one sick dude.
How do you think I found you?
Time's up.
Ready teams for assault.
Can I ask you a favor?
You can ask.
I figure the chances of my getting out of here alive are pretty slim.
So?
I want to kick the snot out of this kid.
He's made my life miserable for 3 lousy years.
Knock yourself out.
How smart are you now, smart guy?!
It's front sight, trigger press, follow through!
That's enough!
It's not that hard!
A dalmatian could do it!
Let go! Let go!
Feel better?
I think he got a messege.
What's that?
We go in 5...
4
We go now!
Federal agent.
Federal agent. Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
It's all clear.
Shakespeare wrote,
"Nothing is so common as the wish to be remarkable. "
You all right?
Nice shot.
I was aiming for his leg.
I wouldn't have kept kicking,
but I was afraid you didn't get my plans.
从我的火力线移开时 我就明白了
Well, I hope I didn't hurt you too badly.
公立高中的12岁神童
You kick like a 9-year-old girl.
No. Keep it.
As far as I'm concerned, you passed your qualification.
Reid, you all right?
Touche, kid.
How you doin'?
You were right. You don't need a gun to kill somebody.
No, you don't.
But it helps.
Yes.
Yes.
应该感到不安
I mean...
I killed a man.
You know, I-I should... feel something.
But I don't.
Well, knowing what you're feelin'...
that's not the same as not feelin'.
This is gonna hurt you...
and when it does...
there's only 3 facts you need to know.
You did what you had to do...
and a lot of good people are alive because of what you did.
What's the third?
I'm proud of you.
