so how &apos;s your mom , ton ?
same .
but my ex @-@ goomar &apos;s cousin , i got her to take care of her . russian girl .
who was telling me the bevilaqua kid
has money from construction ?
fucking matthew was never any good .
he sure cried like a baby .
i think the family was relieved he got taken out .
what are you gonna eat ?
hey , waiter !
that &apos;s the closest cw16 got tony to discussing the bevilaqua murder ?
i think at this point it &apos;s time to consider 16 , bonpensiero , compost .
bonpensiero was crucial to the webistics stock fraud case .
so rico @-@ wise ...
... the airline tickets , mail and wire fraud ...
... if the mother testifies for immunity .
whose own mother &apos;s gonna testify ?
i say focus on his garbage business .
extortion . interstate trucking .
it &apos;ll yield a prosecutable murder .
richie aprile , no doubt about it , the cartel had him whacked .
but tony shows diligence when it comes to debugging .
what about the home ?
they talked in the basement .
his own basement ? where &apos;s the due diligence there ?
tony avoids business at home .
he &apos;ll take somebody out by the pool .
except there he fears parabolics .
the basement has noisy ac ducts .
he turns on the air and he feels safe .
&quot; surreptitiously enter and leave . &quot; a &quot; sneak and peek &quot; warrant .
correct .
i said you could enter the basement .
do we have to impact this family &apos;s privacy ?
first we determine where to best place the wire .
then the listening device will be fabricated and we install it .
see that they limit both entrances to the basement .
it &apos;s not a better homes and gardens tour .
happy hunting .
you know , the coffeemaker &apos;s got to be plugged in for it to work !
same time as yesterday .
i &apos;m just going to the stationery store .
i &apos;ll be right back .
you don &apos;t gotta follow me . all right ?
to drop a wire
there &apos;s got to be nobody home for at least two hours .
the maid is gone on tuesday afternoons .
why ?

she &apos;s gone from 1 till about 2 : 45 .
class , then she and her husband have lunch .

stasiu wosilius .
i &apos;ll run that by anti @-@ terrorism .
carmela &apos;s gone on tuesday . tennis .
we need somebody on her

from what ? why would they be wet ?
i got no fucking idea .
you stand at the urinals ...
come on , will you ?
he &apos;s asking , i &apos;m telling . it &apos;s important .
even if the lace is dry and you don &apos;t touch the shoe .
bacteria and virus migrate .
you see this on tv ?
i gotta watch tv to figure out the world ?
a men &apos;s shithouse is a sewer .
in ladies &apos; johns , you could eat maple ice cream from the toilets .
there &apos;s exceptions . but a men &apos;s ?

they can pour all the ice they want , it does nothing to kill germs .
even if you don &apos;t drag the laces .

hey , nothing sounds crazy anymore . the older i get ...

don &apos;t it happen that twins can die within days of each other ?
that would &apos;ve been okay , believe me .
