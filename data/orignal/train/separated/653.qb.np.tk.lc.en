daddy .
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
daddy .
amanda .
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died , he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives .
lydia davis
we have to get our hands on that photograph .
you don &apos;t know what it took for jack
to put himself out there for you .
you let him think he had a shot ,
conrad .
amanda clarke .
some guy named frank figured out we switched names .
where is he ?
don &apos;t worry . i took care of him .
there &apos;s an old saying about
those who cannot remember the past
being condemned to repeat it .
but those of us who refuse to forget the past
are condemned to relive it .
you &apos;re mad at me , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m a lot of things right now .
the guy had it out for you .
i was protecting you .
you didn &apos;t have to kill him .
there are other ways to handle the situation .
i was expecting a bit more gratitude .
had enough ? !
not even close !
you fight dirty .
your father teach you that
or was he too busy blowing up planes ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i know you were just looking out for me .
it &apos;s just a lot to process at 4 : 30 in the morning .
thank you .
ed , open up . i need to talk to nolan .
mr. ross is asleep .
no , he isn &apos;t .
how could he be ?
need me to stick around , boss ?
no . she &apos;s delivering her daily dose of fresh hell
earlier than usual .
thanks , ed .
it &apos;s the crack of yak , em . spit it out .
i need you to keep an eye on somebody for me .
oh , little old for a babysitter , no ?
you &apos;re funny . cool house .
thanks .
does miss manners have a name ?
the less you know , the better .
do not let her out of your sight .
do you understand me ?
i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
you &apos;ll be safe here , okay ?
the headache is better ,
but my vision &apos;s still blurred .
still no memory about what happened to you ?
whole chunks of time seem to be missing .
well , let &apos;s get your body healed .
in my experience ,
the mind will follow .
lydia .
i came as soon as i heard .
lydia ? it &apos;s victoria .
i know who you are .
i just don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m here .
what the hell happened to me ?
well , you just had a nasty fall , so ...
ms. davis needs to rest now ,
so if you two would follow me .
she has no recollection of her fall whatsoever ?
well , ms. davis sustained a very serious brain injury .
it &apos;s possible the memories associated with her suicide attempt
are simply being suppressed .
so there &apos;s still a possibility they could all come back ?
or just pieces or not at all .
right now , she needs time to heal
and emotional support ,
familiar surroundings ,
uh , friends like the two of you .
and given the proper care ,
there &apos;s no reason to expect anything other than
a full mental and physical recovery .
oh , excuse me .
it &apos;s a good thing i was here when she woke up .
oh , it &apos;s a miracle .
we need to get our stories straight
about why frank attacked her ,
in case her memory does return .
i completely forgot
to make up a lie about coming here last night .
but i made breakfast .
i &apos;ll call you .
morning .
sorry ! gotta go . bye .
see ya .
man ... you must be a terrible cook .
you &apos;re really funny . yeah .
so ...
it &apos;s none of my business , but , uh--
yeah , we slept together .
and by that , i mean slept , together .
and you &apos;re right , it &apos;s none of your business .
well , it kind of is .
i &apos;m not sure how dad would &apos;ve handled
you having a girl stay over ,
but since i &apos;m the guardian now--
our dad was more catholic than the pope .
he &apos;d have blown a gasket , and you know it .
look , this thing with me and charlotte &apos;s heading in the right direction .
trust me .
i do . i &apos;m just sayin &apos; ...
be careful .
oh , we &apos;re not having the condom talk .
look , you &apos;re 17 , so is she ,
but that girl comes from a totally different planet , man .
you guys get caught ,
or worse , she gets pregnant ,
there &apos;s no telling how her family might handle that .
you think i don &apos;t know that ?
just making sure .
other than that ,
live your life .
there he is .
someone didn &apos;t come home last night , again .
yeah , i crashed at emily &apos;s .
where are you off to ?
your dad called , said he needed help
transitioning his home office
to his suite at the southfork inn .
so my mom really kicked him out .
how &apos;d he seem ?
cranky . but don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ve got him taken care of .
ah , emily .
tyler .
you just can &apos;t get enough of this one , can you ?
well , i have a big day ahead of me .
adios , kids .
bagels with fresh lox and cream cheese .
i thought you &apos;d be home
when i got back from the fish market this morning .
oh , so that &apos;s where you went ?
i was thinking maybe i scared you off
with all that love talk .
i told you , i don &apos;t scare easily .
and don &apos;t forget , i said it first .
oh , i won &apos;t .
tucked that little nugget away for safekeeping .
early shift at the stowaway ?
last shift .
it &apos;s time i talk to jack .
not about you ,
just with everything going on with my parents ,
i don &apos;t want to add to their problems . it &apos;s just--
the truth is , i mostly took the job to piss them off anyway .
well , mission accomplished there .
yeah .
but now my dad &apos;s all alone ,
and i &apos;m actually starting to feel bad for him .
you thinking about taking him up on that internship ?
i figure , a few weeks wouldn &apos;t kill me .
is that a bad idea ?
no , not at all . i think you &apos;ll be great .
you do not see me here .
this is the very picture of mortification .
ah , the walk of shame .
more like a bloody knuckle crawl .
i take it , you and tyler made up .
and then some .
your mother cannot see me like this .
the maid said she went into the city .
the coast should be clear .
i should go , too .
okay .
i &apos;m proud of you .
ashley ?
the coast is obviously not clear .
i will kill that boyfriend of yours .
well , maybe she won &apos;t notice .
yeah , maybe monkeys will fly out of my--
ashley ? hello ?
coming , mrs. grayson .
let &apos;s put her in the ground @-@ floor bedroom
right over there , and make sure
that everything she needs is close at hand .
yes , ma &apos;am .
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , there you are .
ms. davis is going to be recuperating here indefinitely .
so i &apos;ll need you to go into the city
and arrange to have all of her things shipped here from her apartment .
morning , mother , lydia . don &apos;t let me interrupt you .
well , it seems you &apos;re not the only one
flaunting last night &apos;s dress .
please go box lydia &apos;s wardrobe , jewelry ,
and most importantly , any photographs
or personal items that might trigger her memory .
of course .
lydia , i had no idea you were making such remarkable progress .
it &apos;s so good to see you .
your face looks familiar , but i--
i can &apos;t quite place you .
lydia ... you don &apos;t remember emily ?
she bought your beach house .
i remember my beach house ,
but ...
i have no idea who you are .
i &apos;m so sorry .
oh , don &apos;t be . really .
this is victoria grayson calling to confirm
lydia davis &apos; physical therapy appointment this afternoon .
just leave your name at the gate ,
and they &apos;ll show you through .
excuse me .
uh , give us a moment , will you , tyler ?
of course . i &apos;ll be in the study . morning , mrs. grayson .
morning .
what part of &quot; get out &quot; are you having trouble with ?
oh , things changed when you moved lydia into our summer home .
what exactly is it that you think you &apos;re doing ?
sooner or later , lydia is going to regain her memory ,
and i want to make sure that it &apos;s sooner .
that way , i can do whatever &apos;s necessary to control her reaction .
well , i can &apos;t let you hurt her any more than you already have .
me ?
i wasn &apos;t the one who sent frank to her apartment that night .
clear out your office and go .
so , jack ,
i was thinking about maybe borrowing the boat tonight .
keep thinking .
come on . i got a date with charlotte .
and i really want it to be special .
well , you &apos;re talking to the wrong guy .
nolan owns the &quot; amanda , &quot;
and he and i aren &apos;t really buddy @-@ buddy anymore .
so what , you &apos;re just gonna give him the boat now ?
go make nice . listen ...
i &apos;m hoping tonight might be the night ,
if you get my drift .
and upstairs ain &apos;t exactly the most romantic spot in town .
come on .
fine . i &apos;ll talk to him .
just ...
promise you &apos;ll use protection .
protection from what ?
the sun . you know , sunburn ?
i &apos;m thinking about taking the boat out .
uh , talk to nolan , would you ?
uh , look , jack ,
i don &apos;t really know how to say this ,
so i &apos;m just gonna say it .
me working here for you
hasn &apos;t exactly been working out , has it ?
you mean , &apos; cause you got drunk on your first shift
or &apos; cause i was hitting on your girlfriend ?
all of the above .
it &apos;s just weird , you know ?
well , you &apos;ll get no disagreement from me .
i already tried to fire you once .
right .
well , i--look , i don &apos;t want to leave you high and dry ,
so if you want me to work my shift today ,
i &apos;m happy to do it .
no , no . i got it covered .
all right , then . i ...
i guess i &apos;ll see you around .
you bet .
i &apos;ll put the sign out .
thanks . i was starved .
mi casa , su casa ...
apparently .
you want to tell me how you know emily ?
nope . you heard what she said .
the less you know , the better .
two peas in a pod , aren &apos;t you ?
mind if i go for a swim ?
shy little thing , aren &apos;t you ?
try one of the house bikinis .
house bikinis ?
too much .
pool room .
around the corner .
hello ?
okay , as charming as your little freebird is ,
exactly how long am i running this day care center ?
one or two days , depending .
depending on what ?
you know i don &apos;t like to be kept in the dark .
who is this girl ? what is she doing here ?
if i told you , i &apos;d have to kill you ,
and you know i mean it .
right now , i &apos;ve got another fire to put out .
do tell .
i &apos;m sending you the picture of me
at grayson &apos;s new year &apos;s party in 2003 .
what , am i supposed to frame it ?
photoshop my face out .
so now i &apos;m a fotomat ?
lydia &apos;s awake , nolan .
if she remembers this picture ,
she &apos;s gonna start looking for it .
i need her to believe that it wasn &apos;t me .
aren &apos;t you bursting with good news ?
i &apos;ll pick it up in an hour .
the tags are still on .
looks like your house bikinis
don &apos;t get a hell of a lot of use .
i know . tragic .
as much as i &apos;d love to stay
and continue whatever this is ,
i &apos;ve got an errand to run for bossy pants .
i can entertain myself .
i have no doubt .
you can group those profit @-@ and @-@ loss statements
with the corporate reports ,
and just , i don &apos;t know , shred everything else .
where &apos;s the ledger for the offshore accounts ?
already boxed up , sir .
right .
i don &apos;t know where my head &apos;s at today .
i can &apos;t imagine how difficult
all this is for you , mr. grayson ,
but i just want you to know ,
my goal is to become indispensible to you .
well , you &apos;re fast approaching it , son .
thank you .
hey , danny .
uh , i thought you were supposed to be tending bar today .
actually , i &apos;m done with the stowaway .
you quit ?
ty , can you give us a minute ?
of course .
how are you holding up , dad ?
i &apos;ve been better . thanks for asking .
you , uh , you told charlotte about you and mom ?
she doesn &apos;t know ?
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;s tougher than you think .
listen , i know this summer &apos;s been difficult ...
and me working at a bar
didn &apos;t make things any easier around here .
so , uh ,
i thought that if you still want me ,
maybe i could give the family business a shot .
nothing would make me happier .
come here .
i &apos;ll get it .
conrad grayson &apos;s line .
uh , yeah . may i tell him who &apos;s calling ?
just take a message .
it &apos;s the police , sir .
this is conrad grayson .
hey , there .
enjoying the show ?
what ? no . i wasn &apos;t . i wasn &apos;t .
i just got here .
i &apos;m looking for nolan .
he left . just me and big ed .
okay .
you mind ?
sorry .
whoever you are ,
want to make yourself useful ?
oh , well , you &apos;re still here ?
and i have some bad news .
is there any other kind ?
frank is dead .
they &apos;ve asked me to identify his body .
what--what happened ? wh--
he was found in a ditch ...
a few miles outside bethlehem .
they &apos;re performing the autopsy later today .
so he was murdered ?
well , they wouldn &apos;t say .
i &apos;m guessing i &apos;ll find out more when i get there .
well , it &apos;s not all bad news , victoria .
a lot of secrets
died with frank .
you know , in many ways ,
you could see this as a relief .
3 ounces of vodka ,
1 ounces creme de cassis ,
and a little blackberry liqueur .
add ice .
and shake .
this is a black dahlia ?
za schast &apos; -ye .
to happiness .
my new crowd of customers would go nuts for this .
you run one of those fancy hamptons restaurants ?
no , no . it &apos;s a dock bar down in montauk .
you should stop by when you have some time ,
before you take off .
jack ?
emily .
hey , uh , have you met ...
i &apos;m sorry . i never actually asked your name .
probably for the best .
right . uh , well ...
this is emily .
listen , if you see nolan before i do ,
could you tell him to pop by the bar ?
i owe him an a--an apology .
yeah , sure .
thanks .
well ... it was nice to meet you .
likewise .
whoever you are .
i brought you some clothes .
thanks .
so that &apos;s the famous jack porter .
all the stories you told me about him in juvie ,
i feel like ...
i already know him .
get inside . this isn &apos;t a game .
i never said it was .
and in case you forgot ,
i don &apos;t like people telling me what to do .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
lucky for you ...
i &apos;m in a good mood .
i &apos;m gonna take care of you--
set up a bank account with monthly deposits
and get you a new identity
so you never have to be tied
to the name amanda clarke again .
but i like being amanda clarke .
it &apos;s our connection .
you and i will always be connected .
then why do you want to ship me off ?
because it &apos;s not safe for you here .
i couldn &apos;t live with myself if something happened to you .
you can stay in my apartment in paris
until i figure out the logistics .
you &apos;ll love it there .
you know i &apos;d do this for you anyway ,
even without the money .
you &apos;re the closest thing i ever had to a sister .
me , too .
you are just about one bad day away
from spending your life in a place like this .
what &apos;s the difference ?
i &apos;m david clarke &apos;s daughter .
i &apos;m in jail no matter where i go .
so you got a bad deal .
but you got something else going for you .
you &apos;re smarter than most of these girls ,
especially emily thorne .
screw her .
oh , you want to go up against the whole world ?
that &apos;s your business .
but violence is a shortsighted solution
when it really comes to handling your enemies .
there &apos;s better ways to go about it .
smarter ways .
like what ?
i &apos;m thinking that all emily &apos;s really looking for is a friend .
you get her trust ,
and you &apos;ll have her work for you
instead of against you .
or you can go about the rest of your life
with a busted lip and a bloody nose .
understand what i &apos;m saying ?
let &apos;s get you unpacked , lydia .
you might be staying a while .
do you remember the girls &apos; trip
we took to positano last winter ?
i don &apos;t have a problem remembering last winter .
it &apos;s the past few weeks that are gone .
so you don &apos;t remember how i found out
about your relationship with conrad
at my memorial day party ?
victoria ...
do you recognize this ?
&quot; ladies and gentlemen ,
&quot; everyone here tonight is a victim--
&quot; a victim of fraud and deceit .
&quot; the ruthless monsters responsible--
victoria and conrad grayson . &quot;
i wrote this ?
and you were prepared to read it
at the open arms benefit
the night that you fell over your balcony .
why would i ?
well , the important thing
is that you didn &apos;t go through with it .
hey , ash . how &apos;s it going ?
apparently , victoria mistook my party planning experience
for an internship at u @-@ haul .
oh , here . let me help you .
thank you , but i don &apos;t need help .
i need a new job .
i thought that working for victoria
was what you always wanted .
no , a life like yours is what i always wanted .
this is just embarrassing .
not that you would understand .
this is almost the last of it .
ashley , would you give us a moment , please ?
with pleasure .
hello , victoria .
hello , lydia .
i went through the house to make sure
there were no keepsakes that still belonged to you .
but , um ...
if you &apos;re missing anything , just let me know .
i &apos;ll have another look around .
that &apos;s very sweet of you .
well , i want lydia to remember
absolutely everything that she &apos;s forgotten .
oh , well , that &apos;s all any of us could want .
you &apos;re lucky to have a friend like victoria .
get well soon .
what is it ?
there &apos;s a photograph .
of whom ?
the two of us .
it &apos;s from your new year &apos;s party in 2003 .
she &apos;s there .
emily ?
oh , no . that &apos;s impossible .
no one knew anything about this girl until this summer .
that doesn &apos;t mean that she didn &apos;t know who we were .
if you find the picture , i can prove it .
i can &apos;t stand that woman .
what &apos;d she do now ?
it &apos;s not what she &apos;s done . it &apos;s who she is .
people like us are disposable to people like them .
no kidding .
i &apos;ve busted my ass to try to get in good with conrad ,
and all that flies right out the window
the minute the prodigal son waltzes back in .
mm . don &apos;t even get me started on emily .
you know she &apos;s the worst of them all , right ?
i mean , at least victoria will look you in the eye
and tell you you &apos;re not good enough .
but emily will just think it
and hide behind that condescending smile of hers .
our problem is , we &apos;ve been playing way too nice .
i &apos;ll cheers to that .
cheers .
hey , boss .
looks like your guy got his head bashed in .
what guy ?
frank ?
holy ...
so the police think that frank was a victim of robbery @-@ carjacking .
well , maybe that &apos;s exactly what the murderer wants them to think .
well , it didn &apos;t sound premeditated .
they say he was in a rough part of town ,
flush with cash ,
probably from the severance check .
frank called me the night he died .
and the last thing he said was that
emily thorne is not who she claims to be .
well , what could she possibly have to do with any of this ?
i had him investigate her .
i think he stumbled onto something .
and she killed him ?
i think maybe your imagination is getting the better of you .
that woman is dating our son .
i &apos;m not going to take that chance .
who are you calling ?
the police .
let &apos;s play a game of 20 questions .
i don &apos;t like games .
sure you do .
you ever heard of a guy named frank stevens ?
sorry .
here &apos;s a clue-- he &apos;s dead .
these are blood stains on your clothes .
who the hell are you ?
what &apos;s going on ?
this wasn &apos;t part of the plan .
yeah , neither was aiding and abetting your evil twin .
you &apos;ve got some explaining to do .
what did you tell him ?
he figured most of it out himself .
he &apos;s smart .
something you &apos;ve clearly forgotten .
i do a lot of questionable things , ems ,
but harboring capital murderers-- not one of them .
it &apos;s not like the guy was a choir boy .
he tracked me down .
she would &apos;ve done the exact same thing--
la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la .
look , i &apos;m not built for prison time .
what are you gonna do when the cops come ?
give them my alibi .
what about her ?
amanda &apos;s on a flight to paris tonight .
i need you to disable the gps in this
so i can turn it on without sending a signal .
i have to erase what &apos;s on it before i get rid of it .
tell me that &apos;s not frank &apos;s phone .
you already know the answer to that .
this is only to save my own ass .
happy trails , amanda .
never mind him .
come on . let me take you to the airport .
kara wilkins ?
that &apos;s my mother &apos;s name .
i thought it was appropriate .
you know i &apos;ve never even left the states ?
not even canada or mexico .
and now you can go wherever you want .
it doesn &apos;t even need to be paris .
come with me .
i wish i could .
dad .
hey , charlie .
you &apos;re a welcome sight .
yeah , i just wanted to say good night . i &apos;m headed out .
yeah , hold on . hold on .
why don &apos;t you come here a moment ?
that doesn &apos;t sound good .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , well , your mother and i are going through another rough patch .
that &apos;s hardly a news flash .
yeah , well ... we &apos;ve decided that i should live elsewhere
while we sort this one out .
are you getting a divorce ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
this is her fault , isn &apos;t it ?
no , it &apos;s both our faults .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone with her , daddy .
i don &apos;t think i can handle it .
oh , yes ... you can handle it .
you can handle anything .
you &apos;re a grayson .
i must have looked through a thousand photographs .
emily &apos;s not in any one of &apos; em .
i could &apos;ve sworn it was her .
i really am losing my mind , aren &apos;t i ?
careful you don &apos;t burn the place down .
yeah , well . charlotte was supposed to be here a half an hour ago .
uh , how many times can you reheat chicken ?
you coulda had the kitchen make something nice for you .
our kitchen ?
right .
ah , well , i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t come through with the boat for your ...
big day .
ah , it &apos;s all right .
i appreciate you giving me the night off .
any last @-@ second advice ?
charlotte . hey , you made it .
i was just leaving .
um , you hungry or , uh ...
hey , hey , look . there &apos;s no pressure here with me .
all right ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s--it &apos;s not you .
can--can we just sit and talk ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , of course . come here .
what , uh , what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s my stupid parents .
i thought you would sleep well
knowing that amanda was on a flight to paris .
happy ?
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m still alive .
you should be , too .
amanda would never hurt me .
right .
cause that &apos;s such a stretch for a violent psychopath .
did you fix the phone ?
i put it behind the planter on your porch
and ...
threw in frank &apos;s wallet for good measure .
i &apos;ll call you later .
i dropped by to see you
and found these two nice detectives waiting on your porch .
detective gunther , hamptons p.d.
this is detective west .
she works out of bethlehem .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
oh . what about ?
the murder of frank stevens .
so what happened to him ?
blunt head trauma .
his body was discovered in bethlehem by a morning jogger .
bethlehem is hundreds of miles from here .
it &apos;s 220 , to be exact .
yet we found his car abandoned just a half mile down the road .
now before mr. stevens was murdered ,
he made several calls to victoria grayson .
well , that &apos;s my mother .
you should be talking to her .
well , we already did .
she told us that , uh , she had mr. stevens
investigating ms. thorne &apos;s past .
and on the night he died ,
the last thing he said to her was , uh ...
&quot; emily thorne is not who she claims to be . &quot;
my mother was having you investigated ?
i don &apos;t believe this .
no , don &apos;t blame victoria .
she had every right to be suspicious .
after my parents died ,
i went through some pretty dark times .
i ended up at allenwood .
what &apos;s allenwood ?
it &apos;s a maximum security juvenile correctional facility .
why maximum security ?
my last foster father abused us .
i put a stop to it .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ve dedicated my life to charity ,
trying to right the wrongs and all of that .
how many times did you cross paths with mr. stevens ?
once .
it was right around the time that your father fired him .
he was waiting for me here ,
threatening to expose me to your family .
i guess he never got around to it .
one last thing .
where were you last night between 12 : 00 a.m. and 6 : 00 a.m. ?
she was in bed with me , all night .
actually , i slipped out before the sun came up
to go to the fish market .
the fish market ?
check the fridge .
wild nova scotia salmon .
the receipt &apos;s time @-@ stamped 5 : 36 a.m.
thank you for your time , ms. thorne .
of course .
i &apos;m so sorry .
come here .
what did she ever do to you ?
you must be talking about emily .
you sent the police to her house .
it was a misunderstanding .
i merely answered the questions ,
and they followed up .
nobody believes that emily murdered frank .
it &apos;s ridiculous .
yeah , it is ridiculous .
they said his car was found a half mile from here .
now how do i know you didn &apos;t murder him ?
oh , it feels pretty terrible to be accused of something
you did not do .
okay ? you don &apos;t make these kinds of mistakes , mom .
why did you have frank investigate emily anyway ?
because she came out of nowhere
and she set her sights on you .
she &apos;s been hiding a criminal record , daniel .
you should be thanking me .
the only thing she was hiding
is that her foster father abused her growing up .
she spent two years in juvie for defending herself .
is that what you hoped to find ?
i didn &apos;t hope to find anything .
what happened to you
to make you feel so threatened all the time ?
or maybe you don &apos;t know why you hate so much .
maybe it &apos;s just who you are .
stay away from emily .
i love her .
where are you going ?
i was the last person in this house to defend you , mom .
and now you &apos;ve lost me , too .
and i thought i wore a lot of pastel .
as long as their money &apos;s green , it &apos;s fine by me .
i , uh ...
i heard you stopped by my place .
yeah , declan wanted to use your boat .
well , it &apos;s never gonna be my boat , jack .
not really
the &quot; amanda &quot; belongs to you .
in fact , um ...
here &apos;s the pink slip .
and , uh ... don &apos;t worry .
you don &apos;t have to pretend to be my friend anymore .
i &apos;ll , um , i &apos;ll see you around .
nolan , wait .
i &apos;m sorry that i tossed you outta here .
all the emily stuff aside ,
you &apos;ve been ...
nothing but nice to me ,
and i was-- i was a jerk to you .
yeah .
but ...
i mean , that &apos;s only &apos; cause you took dating advice from me
in the first place .
that &apos;s an excellent point .
right ?
so we good ?
we &apos;re good .
keep the boat .
it &apos;s a black dahlia .
a what ?
this--black dahlia .
your friend taught me how to make it .
she still in town ?
no .
she &apos;s gone ... for good .
that &apos;s too bad .
kinda felt like there was something about her , you know ?
oh , i most definitely do .
how did it go ?
you okay ?
that house is toxic .
you mind if i stay here a while ?
no , not at all . as long as you need .
i just don &apos;t want to come between you and your family .
you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re actually saving me from them .
oh , finally .
there &apos;s something wrong with my key .
i had the locks changed .
if you want something , i &apos;ll have it sent to the hotel .
victoria ... stop it .
we need to appear united during this investigation .
what do you hope to accomplish by locking me out ?
peace of mind .
meaning ?
how did frank &apos;s car wind up a half mile from here ?
how did that hidden camera end up in lydia &apos;s apartment ?
where were you on the night that frank died ?
you really think i &apos;m capable of cold @-@ blooded murder ?
i think it &apos;s been established
that you &apos;re capable of anything .
yeah , and frank proved himself more loyal to you than to me .
and he even so much as admitted trying to kill lydia for you .
and you practically rejoiced when you found out he was dead .
you knew he had feelings for me ,
and you were terrified that they might be mutual .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
lydia ,
are you awake ?

emily .
amanda ?
you came .
i told you i would .
people have a way of breaking promises when it comes to me .
you look so different .
i changed a few things
when i found out that my dad died .
i heard .
must be a huge relief .
not exactly .
i thought i could handle it ...
being david clarke &apos;s daughter , but ...
people out there ,
they look at me like i took the plane down myself .
since when do you care what people think ?
i &apos;m not as strong as i pretended to be in there .
not like you .
look , i ... i came into some money .
i want you to have this .
half a million dollars ?
i have a favor to ask you .
the past is a tricky thing .
sometimes it &apos;s etched in stone .
and other times , it &apos;s rendered in soft memories .
but if you meddle too long in deep , dark things ...
who knows what monsters you &apos;ll awaken ?
two black dahlias , please .
last call was an hour ago .
it &apos;s okay . i know the bartender .
is that so ?
nice technique .
i learned from the best .
you know , according to nolan ,
you should be halfway across the atlantic by now .
i &apos;m right here ...
exactly where i &apos;m supposed to be .
and i think i might just stay a while .
za schast &apos; -ye .
