i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
love brought me to mystic falls ,
love drove me away .
i love you , damon .
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
and even though we &apos;ve lost so much ...
bonnie &apos;s dead , elena .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s gone .
what are you doing to my brother ?
stefan ...
i--i have no idea who you people are .
our enemies still line up against us .
which one of you is katherine pierce .
she is .
i need her alive .
what do you want with me , silas ?
your blood is the cure , katherine .
i &apos;m dr. maxfield .
good news about having vampire blood in your system is ,
is that &apos;s step one to creating a new vampire .
this is step two .
dr. maxfield , please .
why are you doing this ?
my insides , they &apos;re burning up .
i &apos;m hungry .
subject 62547 .
after his initial transition , 62547 has undergone 3 day without feeding .
subject is weak but lucid .
upper left and right cuspid normal after blood stimulus is removed .
what are you doing to me ?
pupils are at full dilation .
sensitivity to light--
sensitivity to light an obvious 11 on a scale from one to 10 .
what the hell is happening to me ?
why am i so hungry ?
what are you doing to me ?
subject is confused yet self @-@ aware .
personality seems intact .
hunger remains primary focus .
all in all appears to be a perfect candidate .
dear diary ,
do you ever get sick of me writing about death ?
it &apos;s been 4 days since bonnie died--
or 4 days since i found out bonnie died .
she wanted me to go back to school ,
so here i am , back at school--
studying , going to class ,
trying to move on like everyone else .
stefan had it easiest .
he doesn &apos;t even remember bonnie ,
not that anybody has seen him except for caroline ,
who &apos;s back with tyler .
he &apos;s been a healthy distraction for her ,
to say the least ...
and i &apos;ve adopted my own distraction
dr. wes maxfield .
my roommate was killed by a vampire .
and dr. maxfield covered it up ,
and i &apos;d like to know why .
welcome back .
see you at the costume ball tonight ?
i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
besides , the more i have to think about
the less time i have to miss bonnie ...
i &apos;m right here , elena ,
and i miss you , too .
but in the meantime ,
i choose to believe that she &apos;s watching over me
because that &apos;s who bonnie is .
busted .
hey , miss avoiding me for 3 days .
avoiding you ? what ? we &apos;ve been talking .
texting one time .
&quot; want to be my plus one at a costume ball ? &quot;
winky face .
and you never replied .
so i &apos;m guessing this special , in @-@ person visit means yes .
definitely will maybe consider thinking about it .
8 : 00 . caroline got us costumes .
where you going ?
to class .
i &apos;m late .
oh , before i forget , i talked to the registrar ,
and your major is-- drum roll--sociology ...
how about we don &apos;t talk about my major right now ?
and i compelled you a single .
definitely don &apos;t want to talk about my dorm room .
well , we could talk about the hybrid @-@ sized jerk
that you &apos;ve been for not calling me back ever .
how many times do you want me to tell you ?
i &apos;ve been helping a werewolf pack in the land of
no cell phone reception .
well , lucky for you , i figured out a way for you to make up for it .
i thought i did make up for it
a couple dozen times .
you are escorting me to the whitmore historical ball .
the what ?
it &apos;s the one time a year where they put
their whole collection on display ,
and everyone dresses up as famous historical figures .
i got stefan a costume . even he &apos;s going .
come on , tyler .
i mean , how cute will we be as bonnie and clyde ?
seriously ?
you &apos;re right . let &apos;s not talk .
i &apos;m elena .
megan used to be my roommate .
did you know her ?
we knew each other growing up .
i &apos;m sorry .
pretty sad memorial , huh ?
guess it &apos;s not exactly cool to mourn during fall rush .
everyone mourns differently .
some do flowers .
other do what their loved ones would &apos;ve wanted .
yeah . well , what megan would have wanted
was to still be here alive .
they said she committed suicide .
yeah . i know . that &apos;s what they said .
so then what do you think happened ?
yeah . if you care about her ,
get her sunflowers .
she liked those .
hey , do you have a name ?
yeah . i do .
cut to the chase , silas . what do you want ?
i want katherine pierce .
what do you think i want ?
so do i , which is why i took her away from you .
you can have your brown @-@ eyed bitch of a cure for immortality
when i &apos;m done .
but you &apos;ve had her all night long .
so how much longer do you need ?
aren &apos;t you immortal ?
what &apos;s a few more hours to you ?
here &apos;s the thing , nadia .
i don &apos;t really care about what you need .
i only care about what i need .
i &apos;m a little selfish like that .
then why don &apos;t you mind @-@ control a whole town of people
and find out where i &apos;m holding her ?
right . you can &apos;t .
i &apos;m very well aware of my current super power predicament ,
thank you very much ,
and even though my brain is on the fritz ,
thanks to an ex @-@ fiancee stalker witch
who can &apos;t seem to take a hint ,
that doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m not still brilliant
and crafty and becoming rapidly well @-@ versed
in the power of cell phone tracking .
little tip , woman to woman--
don &apos;t piss off the diabolical ones ,
and if you &apos;re gonna hold me hostage ,
the least you can do is feed my properly .
we &apos;ll eat lunch on the road .
let &apos;s get out of here .
or just hand me over ,
let him take his little sip of my blood
so that he can cure himself of immortality ,
and we can all be on our merry way
back to finer accommodations .
a little tip , woman to woman--
don &apos;t offer to hand yourself over to the diabolical ones
when you don &apos;t know the whole story .
indulge me . what &apos;s the whole story ?
silas needs more than just a sip to cure himself .
he needs every last drop of your blood in your body .
but i &apos;m a human now . if he did that , then--
you die .
now come on . let &apos;s go .
so , as we know ,
in a psychotic lapse of judgment ,
bonnie brought you back to life
and died in the process .
may she rest in peace .
she &apos;s actually right over there .
whatever . look .
the whole point is , i just happen to know
a supernatural being who just happens to want to die ,
and in the spirit of nature needing balance
and life for a life and all that stuff ,
i just think it would be a huge waste of a perfectly good death .
what are you talking about ?
something elena doesn &apos;t need to know about
until it works .
wait . you want to work with silas ?
so ...
why did you call me ?
same reason you answered .
you need help ,
and i &apos;m gonna help you .
from the beginning , silas &apos; whole bad @-@ guy plan was to kill himself ,
pass on to wherever he was gonna pass on to ,
and reunite with his dead girlfriend amara .
i want to use his death
to bring bonnie back to life .
what makes you think that i need help ?
well , for starters , you &apos;re still here ,
as in why do you suck so badly at killing yourself ?
to die , he has to be mortal .
if he &apos;s mortal , then he &apos;s a witch ,
and if he dies as a witch ,
then he &apos;s stuck on the other side forever .
he already tried to bring down the veil to the other side .
he failed .
maybe he has a plan &quot; b. &quot;
maybe he wants to do more than just drop the veil
and let all the ghosts out .
she knows i can &apos;t hear her , right ?
she thinks silas wants to destroy the other side completely .
powerful spells are bound by something even more powerful--
the moon , a comet , a doppelganger .
the other side was made 2,000 years ago ,
and it still exists .
that means she must have
bound it to something that could exist just as long .
a mystical anchor .
that &apos;s what binds her spell to the other side .
i want to destroy it .
qetsiyah , or tessa
or whatever the hell she &apos;s calling herself these days ,
she wants to protect it .
so she &apos;s the only person that knows where the anchor is hidden ,
but fortunately ,
she will be at the whitmore historical ball this evening .
really ?
thought you said you lost all of your psychic powers .
oh , i did , but i still have my incredible powers of observation ,
and i observed her buying a cleopatra costume today .
back to my original question ,
let &apos;s say silas destroys the other side ,
cures himself , becomes a witch .
is it supernaturally possible
that he can do a spell that swaps her life for his life
once he--pfft-- kills himself ?
supernaturally , yeah , it &apos;s possible ,
but this is the same silas who murdered my father .
he &apos;s ruthless , and whatever spell he could do ,
there &apos;ll be some consequences .
there always is . so no . my answer is , definitely not .
what &apos;d she say ? tell me ?
she &apos;s in .
what ?
so we have a deal .
well , we have half a deal .
i &apos;m resurrecting some witch with my death ,
but we have yet to discuss how you &apos;re helping me .
well , you &apos;ve yet to tell me what you want .
oh , it &apos;s fairly simple , actually .
i want you to kill your brother .
i &apos;ve been tailing you for 500 years .
there are a few things i was hoping to clear up .
why would i tell you anything ?
you indulge me in some answers ,
and i will let you go .
really ?
my freedom in exchange for a little q &amp; a ?
ok .
in 1864 , there was a vampire roundup in mystic falls .
was there ? i &apos;m bad with dates .
word on the street is that you sold out many vampires ,
including your best friend pearl
and her daughter annabelle .
i was running from klaus .
i needed to jet solo .
i threw a couple of vampire names on the hit list .
sue me .
i also impersonated a teenager
to get my ex @-@ boyfriends to make out with me ,
staged a fake fight to trigger my lover &apos;s werewolf curse , ooh ,
and i chopped off this douchey guy &apos;s fingers with a butcher knife once .
that was cool .
what about ripping a mother away from her daughter ,
having her killed for your own benefit ?
what are you getting at ?
now a little bit about me .
i had myself turned into a vampire to hunt you ,
to even the playing field ,
to track your every move for however long it took me until i found you ,
and i did this
because you killed my mother .
it happened in paris ,
1645 .
i go to paris for shoes .
the shoes i remember .
everything else requires a few more details .
her name was lily atoma .
you were on the run from klaus .
she took you in ,
but when his minions showed up ,
you pointed at my mom , and you said ,
&quot; that is katerina petrova .
she is the one you want . &quot;
so they took her away .
you were never gonna let me go , were you ?
no , but i &apos;d hate for you to die on an empty stomach .
time to go .
you need to call damon and tell him you lied .
so i can lie for you all summer as your witch translator ,
but when it &apos;s something i want ...
silas is too dangerous .
and bringing me back to life wasn &apos;t ?
oh , right , it killed you .
i brought you back because elena needed you .
now she needs you .
what about the consequences ?
haven &apos;t we learned this by now ?
when you abuse magic , there &apos;s always a price .
what is worse than this ?
what is worse than seeing you
and hearing you ...
and not being able to feel you ?
this isn &apos;t enough anymore .
let damon try to bring you back .
all of this , and you weren &apos;t even on the dance committee .
i may have e @-@ mailed them a few suggestions .
did i mention you &apos;re the hottest serial killer in here ?
well , considering the crowd ,
i &apos;ll take that as a compliment .
i thought you got stefan a costume .
he &apos;s james dean .
i went easy on him .
i figured , between the blood lust drama ,
the damon @-@ elena drama , the amnesia drama ,
he &apos;s been through enough .
hey , dance with me .
i &apos;m buzzed , and i &apos;m on the verge of having a good time .
have fun . i &apos;ll get us drinks .
lady anne boleyn .
now , who in their right mind would cut off a head so gorgeous ?
uh , you , my king ,
my not @-@ so @-@ loving husband .
well , maybe i can dance my way out of this doghouse .
yeah , maybe . maybe later .
ooh , or maybe you can tell me
what &apos;s going on with you . come on .
bonnie died 3 months ago , and what was i doing ?
i was having the summer of my life with you .
ah , guilt .
don &apos;t know that .
but i &apos;ve heard it can be a real bitch .
i know that it &apos;s not my fault that bonnie died ,
but it is my fault for not figuring it out sooner .
elena , you are allowed to be happy once in a blue moon .
besides , jeremy was lying to us all summer .
i should &apos;ve figured it out , damon .
i know that it &apos;s not the same ,
but i &apos;m not gonna let megan &apos;s death fall through the cracks , too .
who the hell is that ?
it &apos;s megan &apos;s hometown friend , i.e ,
the latest person of interest in the whitmore mystery .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hey , whatever your name is .
nice t @-@ shirt , understated .
hey , whatever you &apos;re supposed to be .
anne boleyn ,
pre @-@ beheading , obviously .
impressed .
so does a costume compliment earn me ,
like , a formal introduction ?
why do you want to know who i am ?
did you kill megan ?
of course not .
then why are you acting so shady ?
because everyone around me dies .
it &apos;s like a curse .
my friends , my family-- one by one ,
i &apos;ve lost every single person in my life .
so if you had any idea what survivor &apos;s guilt felt like ,
you &apos;d leave me alone .
forget about my questions .
it &apos;s aaron . my name .
i &apos;ll see you around maybe .
where i come from , open bar meant
ceramic jugs of phoenician wine .
ok .
you have no idea who i am , do you ?
no offense , but actually ,
i have no idea who a lot of people are .
tessa .
formerly known as qetsiyah .
the girl who wiped my memories .
nothing personal ,
little ex @-@ boyfriend drama .
let me make it up to you ,
buy you an &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; drink .
more like an &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; keg .
pardon us .
you , my brother , make a terrible wingman .
trust me , last guy to hit on her is still paying for it .
so what , exactly , are we doing here ?
well ...
hello , me .
so you want to explain to me why i just killed my brother ?
well , tessa &apos;s spell mentally linked us .
i lost my psychic abilities .
stefan lost his memories .
and this severed the link ?
yes , damon .
i can read your mind again .
no . i &apos;m not lying .
and maybe you enjoyed breaking your brother &apos;s neck
just a little bit too much .
sold .
i &apos;ll cozy up to the witch
and sift through her mind ,
figure out where she &apos;s hiding the anchor .
and you , all you got to do is keep him dead .
isn &apos;t tess gonna be slightly suspicious
when the man whose brain she just fried
is all of a sudden showing interest in her ?
of all the men here ,
tessa went straight for stefan .
this face won her heart before .
see , a woman never forgets her first love ,
no matter how badly it ended .
ah , look who &apos;s back .
am i in trouble ?
well , according to my brother ,
i am supposed to hate you .
and do you ?
i &apos;ll tell you after that drink .
good . you like tequila .
yes , but not as much as bacon .
in my day , it was all about lamb .
no one thought to cure pig fat .
god , you have the most beautiful smile .
you gonna stare at it all night ,
or are you gonna ask me to dance ?
hey , you want to get out of here ?
these costumes come with handcuffs ,
and you have a single .
look , care .
i didn &apos;t just come back here to get you in bed .
i know . it &apos;s just ...
a happy by @-@ product of us being in school together .
no . i mean ...
what ?
i &apos;m just really glad to be here .
so what brings you to a college costume ball ?
look at me .
last time i looked this good , i couldn &apos;t enjoy it .
oh , that &apos;s right ,
the whole &quot; being stood up at your wedding &quot; thing .
you shouldn &apos;t know that .
i told you that before i fried your memories .
ok . you got me .
i might have asked around about you .
and i &apos;m paranoid .
that &apos;s what i get for trying to marry a lying , manipulative bastard .
oh , come on .
the guy must &apos;ve had some redeeming qualities .
i mean , we know he was obviously extremely good @-@ looking ...
but , i mean , was the guy at least funny ?
are you defending him ?
no , no . it &apos;s just that
you &apos;ve been on this revenge kick for 2,000 years .
and maybe hating him is
an excuse to keep him in your life .
there &apos;s a part of you that still loves him .
now , i really hope he thinks that .
i want to see his face when he realizes just how wrong he is .
ok . i got to admit , there &apos;s a part of me
that just wanted to hear you say that you still love me .
that &apos;s how big my ego is .
but since you &apos;re obviously in denial ...
oh , my god , silas .
ok .
now , where &apos;s the anchor to the other side ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m looking for it , too .
what do you mean , you don &apos;t know ?
you created it .
yes . i created it ,
but the travelers hid it after they killed me .
they move it constantly .
so what are you doing here ?
my pendant is in one of these displays .
it &apos;s a magical talisman that enhances my powers .
i need it to do a locator spell
so i can find the anchor .
well , then get to it
and forget everything we just spoke about .
thank you for the dance .
thank you .
hey , hey , breaking my neck , huh ?
yeah .
pumping me full of vervain .
all we need is a damon @-@ sized rationalization .
oh , the new you sucks .
how would the old me deal with this ,
barrel full of laughs ?
he &apos;d know it wasn &apos;t about him .
who &apos;s it about , damon , huh ,
about you , desperation to prove to elena
that you &apos;re a worthy boyfriend ?
i &apos;m gonna get her best friend back , ok ?
there you are .
having trouble getting that out ?
i grazed your heart on purpose .
which means you didn &apos;t want me dead ?
you still want something .
i do .
i want to know why you made up that fake story
about your mom .
it was a test . you failed .
i knew it was a fake story .
by 1645 , i &apos;d been running from klaus
for a century and a half .
there &apos;s no way any of his minions
would have mistaken anyone for me ,
but you know how my brain works , right ?
so you must have known that i wouldn &apos;t have fallen
for that sob story .
i wanted to get under your skin ,
and it worked because here you are .
what kind of sick game are you playing ?
it &apos;s not a game , katherine .
you did kill my mother , but it wasn &apos;t paris .
it was in a little cottage in england ,
and it wasn &apos;t 1645 .
it was april 6 , 1492,
and she was all alone ,
exiled by her family two years earlier .
you stuck her head in a noose ,
pushed her off the chair ,
and snapped her neck .
who are you ?
my name ...
is nadia petrova ...
and you &apos;re my mother .
no .
you look like a woman on her way to the guillotine .
actually , she was beheaded with a sword .
see ? and that &apos;s why i teach bio .
and you are abe lincoln ?
dr. jekyll .
ok . yeah . i can see that .
so where &apos;s mr. hyde ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not responsible for my darker half .
so would it be totally inappropriate
if a student asked you to dance ?
who could refuse a queen ?
besides , you &apos;re not , nor will you ever be ,
one of my students .
major points for the dance moves ,
but zero points for lying on my ommate &apos;s death certificate .
look . i didn &apos;t want to lie ,
but i couldn &apos;t exactly tell her parents
a mountain lion attacked her at a frat party .
i &apos;d be fired . huh .
want to know my theory ?
what &apos;s that ?
i think a vampire hunted her down ,
ripped her throat out ,
and threw her off that roof .
what do you know about vampires ?
doesn &apos;t matter what i know , elena ,
because we &apos;re never gonna see each other again .
and why is that ?
because there are people at this school watching you and your friends
and asking questions you don &apos;t want them to ask .
so pack your things , drop out ,
and move back to mystic falls .
here you are .
what are you doing ?
look , care .
i can &apos;t do the college thing right now .
yeah . i completely understand .
i have been pushing way too hard ,
and , you know , you need to make your own decisions .
point is , you &apos;re back , and we &apos;re together .
do you know the reason we &apos;re together ?
it &apos;s because klaus granted us permission
to be together .
i &apos;m sorry , but i can &apos;t live like that .
i see . so this is about klaus .
no . this is about me .
he killed my mom and got away with it .
i can &apos;t just start
caring about sociology and frat parties .
you haven &apos;t even given it a chance .
i didn &apos;t come here to give it a chance .
you came here to say good @-@ bye .
i need to go after him .
i need to find a way to destroy his life
like he destroyed mine .
you know what , tyler ?
for someone who hates klaus ,
you certainly sound a lot like him .
stefan .
come to see the show ?
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m using this pendant to find something i &apos;m looking for ,
and i found it .
good .
stefan ? ah !
you awake ?
stefan ?
stefan ?
you alive again ? huh ?
how does it feel , brother ?
stefan ...
stefan , are you ok ?
that &apos;s silas .
no .
he &apos;s working with my brother .
everything he said to you was a lie .
that &apos;s all he knows how to do--lie .
you know where the anchor is .
too bad you won &apos;t be around to find it .
you can &apos;t kill me .
i don &apos;t have to kill you yet .
you love me . you know you love me .
i did love you ...
and then you broke my heart ,
and now i &apos;m gonna break yours ...
or at least stop it from working .
so your blood can &apos;t flow
and your veins dry up ,
and you rot from the inside out
so the world can see you exactly as you are--
cold , gray , hideous ,
monster .
where do you think you &apos;re going ?
what ?
give them . come on .
i &apos;m fine .
he said , releasing molecules of alcohol on his breath .
you know , you sound like that dad
who thinks he &apos;s cool , but isn &apos;t .
well , i &apos;ll settle for that very uncool
and mildly responsible legal guardian .
keys ... now .
can i have some money for a cab ?
i mean , you do manage my trust , right ?
i saw you talking to elena gilbert .
do yourself a favor .
stay away from that one .
why ?
because behind my very uncool exterior ,
i do care about you , aaron .
whatever .
be safe .
oh , my god . stefan .
that ain &apos;t stefan .
silas ?
damon . what the hell is going on ?
looks like tessa had her way with him .
so if that &apos;s silas ,
then he &apos;s not a problem anymore .
this is a good thing , right ?
actually , no .
it &apos;s a very , very bad thing .
you &apos;re a fool not to run .
silas will find you .
or he won &apos;t .
you &apos;re the one who said it .
i &apos;m pretty good at dodging the diabolical ones .
besides , silas doesn &apos;t need me until he figures out
how to destroy the other side .
if he cures himself before then ,
he goes back to being a witch .
he dies as a witch , well ,
he &apos;s stuck in supernatural purgatory .
there &apos;s just been one outstanding question
that &apos;s just been nagging at me for the last 500 years .
where were you in 1498 ?
i don &apos;t know . i was 8 . why ?
because by 1498 , i &apos;d escaped ,
ditched the people that were chasing me ,
and found my way back to bulgaria .
i searched every village ,
every cottage , but i couldn &apos;t find you .
you went back ?
yes , nadia .
i went back for you .
it &apos;s nice to meet you .
care--
wait .
i &apos;ve been thinking about it ,
and i &apos;ve decided that ...
i &apos;m not going to have this conversation again .
i can &apos;t just sit here while i &apos;m waiting for you to come back .
i don &apos;t want that , either .
then stay .
just be the love of my life .
just love me more than you hate him .
i &apos;m sorry , care . i can &apos;t do that .
no . no . no !
don &apos;t you dare walk away from me .
i swear to god , tyler ,
if you take one more step , we are done , ok ?
no more surprises ,
no more excuses , no more chances .
we are done .
so professor blondie knows about vampires ?
he said that if i don &apos;t drop out of school ,
the wrong people are gonna start asking the right questions .
ugh , that &apos;s not good .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know , but all i do know
is that finding out the truth about megan
isn &apos;t gonna bring bonnie back .
yeah . well , neither is a desiccated silas in our living room .
so the only way for silas to trade in his life for bonnie &apos;s is
if he &apos;s a witch ,
but the only way to become a witch
is to have the cure .
yep .
what ?
now , who could that be ?
well , hello .
what &apos;s so urgent ? i &apos;m on the run .
don &apos;t exactly have time for a pit stop .
or maybe i do .
maybe i have all the time in the world .
katherine pierce eludes death yet again--
and you two finally did something right for once .
how does it feel ?
thrilling .
damon , no .
he needs the cure to become a witch .
no !
no . no . no , damon . no , no , please .
he need all of my blood .
it &apos;ll kill me , damon .
damon , please , i don &apos;t want to die .
i don &apos;t want to die , damon .
i don &apos;t want to die . please .
good @-@ bye , katherine .
do you hear that ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
takes a licking , keeps on ticking .
am i in hell ?
