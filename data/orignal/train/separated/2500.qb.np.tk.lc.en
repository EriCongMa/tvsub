is there any better feeling
than waiting for a live krusty show to start ?
maybe watching your bride coming down the aisle .
why does she get to eat before the reception ?
seltzer bottle connected and pressurized ?
check .
roll @-@ up dicky set to six ?
nope . 11 .
my comedy comes from taking risks .
or avoiding them , i can &apos;t remember .
krusty , we need to talk .
make it fast . i got a coiled up spring
ready to boi @-@ oi @-@ oi @-@ oi @-@ oing .
oh , why can &apos;t i be funny with just my words ?
bill maher doesn &apos;t put dangerous things near his crotch ,
except when he &apos;s off work .
yeah .
it &apos;s about your vodka , absolut krusty .
we &apos;re having trouble persuading people
it &apos;s hip to drink a vodka made by a clown ,
in a bottle shaped like a clown ,
that does this when you open it .
always gets me .
yeah , plus , that tv special
where you drank another brand of vodka didn &apos;t help .
i used up my stuff poisoning deer .
if we &apos;re ever gonna sell your vodka ,
we need to do something completely unorthodox--
a viral marketing campaign .
get to the point !
unless you want a face full of clown chunks !
people are more likely to drink your vodka
if they think all their coolest friends are drinking it .
so , we pay for a big party
at the home of a springfield trendsetter .
your brockman , your bumblebee man ...
bumblebee man 西班牙情景喜剧演员
he invites his cool friends , we serve free cocktails ,
made with your vodka , generating buzz .
we got buzz .
positive buzz .
that exists ? wow .
so , all you have to do is find one of your loyal fans
whose house we can trash and friends you can exploit .
i need a drink .
not that ! never that !
hey , hey , kids !
who wants to host a viral marketing event ?
yay !
all you have to do is write me a letter
about how hip and influential your parents are .
milhouse , i &apos;m gonna win that thing .
how do you know , bart ?
maybe for once i &apos;ll win .
children of troubled marriages not eligible .
so , uh , why are you here ?
is it about that unauthorized krusty lookalike
i hired for lisa &apos;s first communion ?
what was his name ?
krappy the klunk . see ?
homer , we &apos;re here to throw the most redonkulous
marketing outreach this town &apos;s ever seen .
all you have to do is invite every cool person you know .
hey , i wrote the application .
do any of my friends get to come ?
one friend .
he can listen to music with headphones on ,
he gets one slice of cheese pizza ,
and if the party gets slow ,
he has to pretend to let krusty save him from drowning .
redonkulous !
off the dilge !
和 &quot; 新 &quot; 普森一家共庆友谊地久天长
this party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan .
i hope bart &apos;s having fun .
and that &apos;s why john gielgud is more of a father to me
than my own father .
where &apos;s the nachos you promised ?
there &apos;ll be time enough for nachos !
why can &apos;t i go to the grown @-@ up room ?
you said the clown scared you .
well , he did a little .
boy , everyone from the nuclear plant is here .
except the bosses , of course .
yeah , even homer &apos;s not dumb enough to invite ...
so !
this is the famous party .
he &apos;s destroying our youthful demographic !
oh , god , i need a drink !
so the car in front of us forgot to validate his ... uh ...
i was in an anecdote once .
um , i have surgery in the morning .
yeah , and i &apos;m the one having the surgery .
homer , you &apos;re the nominal host .
do something !
mr. burns ,
so glad you &apos;re here .
finally , the party can get started .
your cotillion seems to be in full promenade .
good one .
uh , mr. burns , everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke .
come on , just pick a popular song .
do you have anything by prince ...
wilhelm of prussia ?
i have 16 million songs , but , uh , no .
just play the oldest , stupidest thing in your catalog .
uh , let me check my beeswax cylinders .
uh , here we are .
come josephine in my flying machine
going up she goes , up she goes
balance yourself like a bird on a beam
in the air she goes , there she goes .
may you all fly in an aeroplane someday .
you certainly seem to be enjoying yourself , sir .
indeed . that homer simpson is the beating baboon heart of this party .
so he says , &quot; bigamy is having one too many wives . &quot;
to which i replied , &quot; so &apos;s monogamy . &quot;
oh , yeah !
i may have a use for this simpson character
higher up in the organization .
really ? well , as safety inspector ,
he hasn &apos;t exactly set the world on fire ,
although he came close several times .
simpson , you &apos;re probably wondering why you &apos;re here .
it &apos;s never good .
i always wind up being chased by hounds ,
or falling through a trapdoor ,
or being a peg in your game of human croquet .
when i made you a hoop , you split your pants .
now , here at the plant , there &apos;s no position more important
than our accounts man , who &apos;s responsible
for glad @-@ handing our customers and suppliers .
i &apos;d like you to take over that position .
the last thing i understood in that was &quot; pants . &quot;
just give me your answer , and make it quick !
our current account man , robert marlowe here ,
is retiring at the end of the month .
in two weeks , the only tie i &apos;ll be wearing is
for autoerotic pleasure .
yes . simpson , only you have the bonhomie
and rotund charm to replace him .
it means a hefty expense account and a corner office .
well , in that case ...
before you say yes , simpson , i feel it &apos;s my duty to warn you ,
account men lose their soul .
woo @-@ hoo ! no more church !
so long , sector 7 @-@ g.
hello , sector 22 @-@ f !
the higher they rise , the further they fall !
you know , you &apos;re kind of a downer .
i thought you were retiring .
why are you still here ?
hey , you &apos;re a baby account man .
still on the bottle .
so , for my last good deed before i retire ,
i &apos;m going to help you persuade mayor quimby
to sign off on a nuclear rate hike .
uh @-@ oh , a meeting with the mayor .
how do i prepare for that ?
i see .
now , how do i prepare for the meeting with the mayor ?
i am really enjoying this , but , um ...
hello ! meeting with the mayor ?
aw . bourbon go bye @-@ bye .
there ain &apos;t enough bourbon in kentucky for you , big guy .
yeah , the governor wrote me a letter to that effect .
wow , i can &apos;t believe
i &apos;m eating steak with the mayor .
the next time , i vote for you , it &apos;s gonna be on purpose .
much obliged .
now , uh , where would you like
to discuss your proposed tax breaks ?
hey , homer !
look at you , man !
i &apos;ve outgrown you !
oh , mr. mayor , more peanut nore ?
say what you will , man .
he &apos;s pretty resourceful .
享受选手带来的震撼
these seats are amazing .
and if you don &apos;t like the score , you can change it yourself .
boring
god , what a great game !
and you , too , can be on the winning team , mr. mayor .
the springfield nuclear team .
i have never heard an analogy involving sports !
i love it !
i can &apos;t believe that was work !
yeah , but work is over now .
want to drink with me till i fall asleep ?
oh , well ...
mm , i really should look at this picture a little longer .
okay , let &apos;s go .
great . now , in honor of my last day on the hamster wheel ,
i have a little gift for you .
this set of bar tools has been passed down
from account man to account man since the dawn of history .
1956 .
can you be my dad ?
if your mom was a secretary , there &apos;s a good chance i am .
welcome home , handsome !
it &apos;s a rat race , but it looks like i won .
oh , to the victor go the spoils .
dad , you were supposed to read me a bedtime story .
oh , sorry , sweetie .
bart can read it to you .
read to lisa ? why don &apos;t you just ask me to kiss her ?
if you kissed her , that would be lovely .
i &apos;ll read ! i &apos;ll read !
and kiss .
does anyone want my opinion ?
please , lisa .
i had 18 martinis today .
hello .
all right , lis , let &apos;s get this stupid bedtime story over with .
proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark
as i cuddle up with madam bunny .
&quot; if genn @-@ i @-@ oos ... &quot;
genius .
... &quot; is eternal pati ...
&quot; pat @-@ eh ...
pa @-@ tie ... &quot;
patience . patience !
get on with it !
shut up ! shut up !
i &apos;m a bad reader , okay ? !
well , i could help you .
i don &apos;t want your help !
i &apos;ll get one of those jobs where you don &apos;t need to read ,
like french fry maker or general .
well , you &apos;re getting my help .
forget it .
don &apos;t you want to be able to read the things
people carve into your chest in prison ?
i guess .
close enough .
&quot; but when the helpful voice was silent ,
&quot; the daily lesson over , the beloved presence gone ,
&quot; and nothing remained but loneliness and grief ,
then jo found her promise very hard to keep . &quot;
we did it , bart.
i &apos;m a mentor .
big deal , you taught me to read one book .
no , bart , you can read other books , too .
what ? !
homie , what are you doing ?
my work is so meaningless .
you make electricity .
it runs the hospital .
you can &apos;t touch electricity , marge ,
you can &apos;t feel it .
that &apos;s because it would kill you .
it already is killing me , marge .
you &apos;re the only one i can talk to .
my wife just doesn &apos;t get it .
i &apos;m your wife .
my job is my wife ,
loneliness-- my mistress , despair-- my sex buddy .
angst is a chick i met online ,
but then it turned out it was really a guy .
i &apos;m going to bed .
you don &apos;t understand me .
only she understands me .
another round , kid ?
hey , uh ... i got here after you did .
i &apos;m sorry to bother you at home , mr. marlowe ,
but my husband &apos;s acting pretty odd--
coming home late , drinking in the morning .
wake me when you get to &quot; odd . &quot;
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d consider taking your old job back
so homie can go back to his old job ?
sorry , marge , that account job hollowed me out
like a cheap chocolate bunny .
i &apos;ve been divorced three times , i &apos;ve got a cocktail addiction ,
a shrimp cocktail addiction ,
and i can &apos;t stop bending women to my sexual will .
well , you certainly won &apos;t be bending me ...
wait , how did i end up in your bedroom ?
lady , i am smoother than an eisenhower @-@ era freeway .
look , i came to talk about my husband , and ...
how did we get in here ?
i think better in the shower .
there &apos;s room in here for two .
i &apos;m a happily married woman .
wow , no woman &apos;s ever done that to me before .
your husband is a lucky man .
i know , and i don &apos;t want him to stray
from anything except his diet ,
and i don &apos;t really want him to do that .
marge , i made a big mistake years ago .
i gave up on my family .
then i gave up on my secret other family .
i missed my son &apos;s graduation , my father &apos;s funeral ,
and my dog &apos;s best in show .
don &apos;t let homer make the mistakes i did .
luann ?
it &apos;s not what you think .
it &apos;s much weirder .
you &apos;re reading a chapter book .
for fun !
bullies , to me .
let &apos;s see the name of this wedgie ticket .
little women ?
are you aware that &apos;s another way of saying &quot; girls &quot; ?
look , i had to read it to my sister .
well , maybe we should hear a little .
and then maybe you &apos;ll be hearing from my sisters .
your fists are sisters ?
yeah , poke @-@ ahontas and sock @-@ ajawea !
nice save .
get reading .
&quot; and amy and jo hugged one another close ,
and everything was forgotten in one hearty kiss . &quot;
end of chapter eight .
you can &apos;t stop now .
i want to know if their father comes home .
does jo learn to handle her hasty temper ?
does amy get over her conceitedness ?
aw , come on , guys , it &apos;s getting dark .
okay , but you better be here tomorrow after school .
&apos;cause we &apos;re going to keep making you read us
a lame ol &apos; girl &apos;s book .
bart needs to work on differentiating
the character voices a little better .
i know , i keep going , &quot; why is meg saying that ? &quot;
and then i realize it &apos;s beth .
that &apos;s right .
your wife is here , mr. s.
tell her i &apos;m at a meeting , not drinking .
this is a whisper @-@ amplifying intercom .
homer , i want you to come with me and the kids
on a family vacation .
of course , of course .
family is everything to us company men .
now , where shall we go on your vacation ?
the farthest thing from this office i know :
rafting down rattler river canyon .
that &apos;s great-- let me run the numbers
&apos;cause i really want the simpson account .
and give these cigars to your children .
don &apos;t talk to me like i &apos;m a client .
you &apos;re not a client , you &apos;re the client .
simpson , put on your charm- their @-@ pants @-@ off pants .
the mumpish oafs in washington are sending
their sternest band of nuclear regulators ,
handpicked to resist all blandishment .
i &apos;ll handle it , i always do .
rafting , eh ?
it &apos;s a perfect way to entertain them .
finally , humanity has found a use for water .
mr. burns , i can &apos;t go rafting with you because--
wait a minute , could this all work ?
oh , no , you don &apos;t .
coggily @-@ doggily .
it all fits .
mr. burns , rafting it is .
excellent .
but mr. s. ,
you just promised this week to mrs. s. , master b. ,
and mamselles l. and m.
now , relax , dottie .
leave everything to me .
oh , marge , this is the most romantic trip
you ever nagged me into .
and maybe when we get home ,
we can ride down something else .
not sure what you &apos;re going for , but ...
uh , marge , why don &apos;t i catch us some salmon ?
it &apos;s about time .
we &apos;ve been making small talk about mussolini for 15 minutes .
well , i , uh , found that contact lens i was missing .
let me just screw her back in .
so , everybody good ?
why did you get us ...
the diversity kittens on meltingpot mountain ?
it &apos;s more fun to play with a ball of yarn
if it has all the colors in it .
and yarn should be allowed to marry dental floss .
if you &apos;ve got that , then ...
are you sure you &apos;re martin scorsese ?
enjoy the outdoors , you stupid kid .
this family time is so precious .
got to go .
homer , i want a long island ice tea ,
america &apos;s most complicated cocktail .
homer ,
are you schmoozing those men ?
um , i think we &apos;re supposed to get off here .
take us out first .
anyone can start a family .
these days no one can find a job .
let &apos;s see , my family gives me love and sex .
my work gives me money and sleep .
hurry , we &apos;re heading for the falls !
my coworkers are like a family ,
but in some ways my family is like a family , too .
for god &apos;s sakes , homer ,
i &apos;ve given you three children .
whose side are you on ?
yours , homie , i &apos;m always on yours .
how ironic .
i survived the titanic by making a raft
out of steerage passengers , and now this .
mr. burns , your heart will go on .
marlowe , i thought you retired .
i can &apos;t-- treasury bills are paying nothing .
nothing !
well , simpson , you were willing to let me go over a waterfall ,
but you cut operating expenses by six percent ,
so you &apos;re forgiven .
thanks .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i don &apos;t really like bourbon or business talk ,
just good old simpson family fun .
hey , kids , i &apos;m it .
i &apos;m okay , and i found some gold !
see , luckiest man in the world .
oh , i &apos;m so glad
you &apos;re not an accounts man anymore .
yep , your worries are over .
i &apos;m back to being a
boring old safety inspector at a nuclear power plant .
