we could park ourselves on one of their trains , boy ,
him and me , plainclothes .

it wasn &apos;t even fair .
it was like shooting fish in a barrel .

crab , lobster , raw fish .
that &apos;s right .
you guys eat anything other than seafood out here ?
well , we eat a lot of seafood .
for what ?
don &apos;t know how you do it , man .
i could not eat the same kind of food every day .
actually ...
stop .
i distinctly remember
you dragging me to this barbecue pit
in logan square every single day .
that &apos;s right .
for three weeks .
till you finally got yourself up enough nerve
to ask out a certain , uh , waitress .
but you got to admit ...
... it was worth it .
yeah , he got the girl ,
and i gained an extra five pounds .
and another 20 pounds since .
uh , excuse me .
you know , i can lose weight .
there ain &apos;t no cure for ugly .
okay ?
that was dirty .
so ... so how are you guys celebrating tomorrow ?
well , it &apos;s kind of still up in the air ,
but we &apos;re gonna start out with a nice long hike ,
and then have a little breakfast picnic .
that sounds nice .
what you gonna do after that ?
oh , cut it out , please .
no , i got a better idea . picture this .

i &apos;m sorry , buddy , but , uh , she &apos;s right .
i mean , you guys are a big part of the reason we &apos;re here .
but tomorrow , we want a little alone time .

but this saturday belongs to us .
you two are spending the entire day with us ,
and it &apos;s non @-@ negotiable .

kualoa ridge ,
we &apos;re halfway up , and she fell .
wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
i think she &apos;s dead .
clay !
please wake up .
she was d.o.a. when we got here .
there &apos;s nothing we could have done .
i &apos;m sorry .
looks like she fell from up there .
oh , my god .
dr. bergman gave the okay to transport the body ,
but mr. maxwell won &apos;t let the m.e. guys move in .
stay here , i &apos;ll talk to him .
clay .
they @-@ they want to take her , man .
they can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t let them ... put her in one of those bags .
i can &apos;t do it .
buddy .
they have to take her , and you have to let them .
we &apos;ll ride down there together
with diane , you and me .
i promise you , i know the m.e. ,
he will take good care of her .
we got to go , partner .
come on , let &apos;s go . come on .
all right .
all right .

vic &apos;s name is glen hurd , 34 years old .
he &apos;s the building &apos;s leasing agent .
custodian found the body when he arrived
for work this morning .
any signs of forced entry ?
negative .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna need a list of , uh , anybody who could have
gotten in or out of this place , uh , after hours .
i &apos;ll get on it .
okay , thanks .
dr. shaw .
morning , detective .
what &apos;s going on ? there &apos;s usually more of you around here .
yeah , we &apos;re a little short @-@ staffed this morning .
the rest of the team is out at kualoa with , uh , dr. bergman .
all right , what can you tell me ?
single gsw to the chest , no exit wound .
what about time of death ?
uh , based on rigor and body temp ,
i &apos;d estimate time of death at around 1 : 00 a.m.
all right , uh , why don &apos;t we hurry up ,
get this guy to the morgue ,
get that bullet out ,
see if we have any luck with ballistics .
there &apos;s nobody ... you need help ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;ll just ask officer kai .
no , he &apos;s got to stick around
and secure the crime scene .
i &apos;ll help you out .
wow , chivalry &apos;s not dead .
nope , just this guy .
so , you know , i really owe you one .
yeah , just don &apos;t ask me to help with the autopsy .
i wasn &apos;t talking about this ,
although i do appreciate the assist .
i , um , i wanted to thank you for suggesting i take up surfing .
i &apos;ve been catching waves every morning .
uh , just ankle snappers .
but , um , it &apos;s been ... therapeutic .
well , good .
i &apos;m glad , you know .
nobody , uh ... nobody ever takes my advice .
not even your daughter ?
she &apos;s 12 .
enough said .
this isn &apos;t good .
no , it &apos;s fine .
you got to be kidding me .
no signal .
hello ! pua !
somebody help !
somebody &apos;s gonna hear us , right ?
crime scene &apos;s on the other side of the building .
keep making noise .
hello ? !
this was my fault .
come on , now , don &apos;t say that .
i was walking in front of her .
so i didn &apos;t even see it happen .
i just heard her yell ,
and then i turned around , and she ...
she was gone .
i should have been holding her hand .
i should have been looking out for her .
hey , hey , hey , come on , now .
look at me , look at me .
this was not your fault .
this was nobody &apos;s fault .
it &apos;s just a horrible accident .
how am i supposed to just go on ?
she was my life .
i &apos;m so , so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
she loved you so much , you know .
i mean , the both of you .
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s with god now , right ?
you &apos;re gonna come with me , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna come back to our house .
lou ?
i &apos;ll be along as soon as i can , babe .
okay .
come on . come on .
how you doing ?
thanks for coming .
yeah , of course .
i just , i @-@ i ... i kind of figured
you &apos;d want to be with clay right now .
i just kind of want to walk the scene a little bit , you know .
why ?
i mean , hpd &apos;s already been out here .
lou , what &apos;s going on ?
me and clay , we come up together .
went to the academy together .
walked the beat together .
i known the man 25 years .
in a lot of ways , we know each other
better than our wives do .
did .
over the years , i &apos;ve talked to hundreds of victims
who &apos;ve lost their loved ones .
but clay--
he &apos;s saying all the things you usually hear .
and i can &apos;t explain it ...
but there &apos;s something about the way he &apos;s saying it .
it just doesn &apos;t seem genuine .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
what are you ... what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying i don &apos;t think this thing was an accident .
okay , wait a minute , all right ?
you &apos;re telling me that clay , your best friend ,
guy you known for 25 years ,
pushed his wife off this cliff ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
why would he do that ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe they come up here and they had a fight .
the guy &apos;s got a temper .
heat of the moment ?
maybe it was premeditated .
i don &apos;t know the reason , but i know him .
and i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s more to this thing .
lou ...
just hear me out .
all right , so ...
they come up here .
they &apos;re walking this way .
according to clay ,
he &apos;s walking in front of her ,
he didn &apos;t even see her drop .
but i don &apos;t see how in the world
she could &apos;ve lost her footing .
yeah , it &apos;s high up here and the trails get narrow ,
but look around here ; it &apos;s wide .
all you have to do is just hug this side ,
and there &apos;s no way that you &apos;re gonna fall off this thing .
yeah , if she &apos;s paying attention .
what if she got distracted ?
listen , just hear me out now , okay ?
look around .
i mean , there &apos;s a lot to take in here , lou .
she takes her eyes off the track for a minute ,
gets too close to the edge , it &apos;s wet ,
slippery ...
she goes over .
it happens .
and as far as this thing being planned ...
i mean , i spoke to duke on the way out here ,
and he told me that clay risked serious injury
climbing down this cliff to get to his wife .
he could &apos;ve doubled back down this trail ,
but that would &apos;ve taken more time .
clearly , he was ... he was desperate to get to his wife .
now , if this was deliberate , that wouldn &apos;t be the case .
yeah , unless he &apos;s worried about how it &apos;s gonna look
if he takes the long way around .
listen to me .
every day , you and i , we see people at their worst .
so it &apos;s natural for us to always be suspicious .
but i got to tell you ,
there is nothing here that points to anything
other than an accident , as far as i can see .
and what about a cop &apos;s intuition , hmm ?
what about that ?
well ... i absolutely believe in that .
but i also know that ...
really bad things happen sometimes for no reason at all .
yeah .
oh ! hey ! stuck in here !
pua !
you gonna help or not ?
honestly , detective , i think it &apos;s a lost cause .
i think we just need to accept the fact
that we are stuck in here until someone finds us .
oh , yeah ? when &apos;s that gonna be ?
hopefully , before this body starts to get ripe .
oh , that &apos;s funny . let me explain something to you .
doing nothing is not an option .
you think this is funny ? it &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;ve heard of stories of people
getting stuck in elevators for days-- days .
i really don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna happen .
my cell phone doesn &apos;t work . your cell phone doesn &apos;t work .
the alarm doesn &apos;t work . okay ?
no one &apos;s coming to look at office space
because this guy , the office manager , is dead .
we have got to be proactive .
or we can conserve energy .
we got no food , we got no water .
oxygen level in here is getting very low .
there &apos;s plenty of oxygen .
then why can &apos;t i breathe ?
detective ?
can &apos;t stay in this place .
can &apos;t stay in this box anymore .
i can &apos;t stay in this box .
what is happening ?
all right , look , i am , uh ...
i am very claustrophobic ,
like , very , very , very claustrophobic .
and i &apos;ve been trying to hold it together ,
but if i don &apos;t get out of this box soon ,
i &apos;m gonna lose my mind .
and i don &apos;t want to lose my mind , okay ?
in fact , i think that right now it &apos;s happening .
okay , okay , okay .
listen to me .
everything is gonna be okay .
yeah ?
okay , right now , neurotransmitters in your brain
have sent the wrong signal ...
... activating your sympathetic nervous system .
you just need to ride this out
until your parasympathetic nervous system
can restore your body to a normal state .
that &apos;s good . can you do me a favor and speak english , please ?
okay . your body is lying to you .
it &apos;s telling you you &apos;re in danger , but you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re not .
so it &apos;s like a glitch .
exactly !
it &apos;s a glitch .
that &apos;s all . just a glitch .
there &apos;s no danger .
no danger .
there &apos;s no ... there &apos;s no threat , okay ?
you &apos;re completely safe .
absolutely .
now just breathe . just relax .
breathe .
there you go . you got it .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
it &apos;s not often i get to use my medical knowledge
to help living people .
i need your help . my wife .
sir , what happened to your wife ?
she fell ! she fell off the cliff !
what is your location ?
kualoa ridge .
come on , you got to send help !
yes , sir , i &apos;m sending paramedics .
what is your wife &apos;s condition ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m trying to get down to her .
oh , god , baby , please be okay .
what is your wife &apos;s condition ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m trying to get down to her .
oh , god , baby , please be okay .
clay &apos;s 911 call .
you want to listen ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m trying to get down to her .
oh , god , baby , please be okay .
sounds pretty shaken up , upset .
he sounded just like that when he called me .
if it &apos;s a performance , it &apos;s a good one .
it &apos;s convincing .
yeah .
except ... where &apos;s the sounds of him &quot; risking serious injury &quot;
working his way down to his wife ?
you &apos;d at least hear some effort .
branches snapping .
rocky terrain breaking loose .
and i got another problem .
i just talked to a hiker
who made a second 911 call .
it turns out ,
she heard diane scream when she went over the side .
but after that ...
nothing .
she didn &apos;t hear clay calling out to his wife .
if that had been my wife ,
i &apos;d have been going out of my mind like a maniac ,
yelling out her name .
how come clay didn &apos;t do that ?
that don &apos;t strike you the least bit odd ?
oh , it does .
hey , i &apos;m sorry to have to do this , buddy .
ah , it &apos;s okay .
you know , i know the drill , man .
you @-@ you need a statement .
but i &apos;ll try to get you through this as quickly as possible .
i pretty much have all the information i need .
just want to fill in a couple of blanks .
so let &apos;s start with the hike .
whose idea was that ?
diane &apos;s ?
what time did you guys set out ?
about six .
ooh . that &apos;s early . why so early ?
well , we wanted to get out there before it got too hot .
all right .
you guys take any pictures ?
yeah .
yeah , diane ,
uh , shot a selfie of us at the foot of the trail .
we were gonna shoot some more pics , uh ...
when we got to the top .
after the accident ,
about how long do you think it took before you called 911 ?
i don &apos;t know . 15 , 20 seconds .
i was just scrambling ,
trying to get down to her and i called on the way .
i guess before that , you were pretty hysterical .
just ... screaming out her name and ...
yeah .
yeah , i must &apos;ve ...
i must &apos;ve yelled her name at least three , four times .
three or four times ?
i was just , you know ...
i was just screaming .
i mean , why ? is that important ?
well , not to me .
but , um , the state demands a thorough inquiry .
you have an accident in one of their parks .
they want to know as much detail as possible .
i &apos;m almost done .
well , the hotel was a bust .
please tell me you guys had better luck .
we dug through the maxwells &apos; personal and financial lives .
didn &apos;t come across any red flags .
nothing unusual in their bank statements .
no beefed @-@ up insurance policy on diane .
uh , the truth is , lou ,
we &apos;re short on motive
and we &apos;re short on evidence .
i just got off the phone with the crime lab .
they found traces of vegetation and minerals
on clay and diane &apos;s clothing
consistent with those found at kualoa .
diane &apos;s blood was on both her own and on clay &apos;s ,
but that was likely transferred when he was giving her cpr .
well , were there any unusual rips
or @-@ or tears in the clothing ?
nothing that speaks to a struggle .
well , she wouldn &apos;t know it was coming .
she wouldn &apos;t have even known to protect herself .
she trusted him .
he was her husband .
you know , lou ,
a lot of guys in my old squad believed i.a.
when they said i was a dirty cop .
when i asked them why , they said
it was just something they could feel .
they went with their instinct ,
and they turned their back on me .
but they were wrong .
i &apos;m not wrong .
how can you be so sure ?
you know , one night when we were at the academy ,
one of our training officers busted me and clay
trying to sneak back on campus after lights out .
now , as violations go , it was pretty serious .
absolute grounds for expulsion .
so the t.o.-- he sits us down .
now , this guy was a human lie detector .
never met a suspect he couldn &apos;t break .
so he says to us ,
&quot; you two birds better have
&quot; a damn good reason for breaking curfew .
&quot; otherwise ,
&quot; i &apos;m shipping your sorry asses out on the next bus . &quot;
now the truth is : we were at a ball game .
went to a white sox game .
the thing goes extra innings , and now we &apos;re late .
but clay looked that t.o. right in the eye
and without missing a beat , he says ,
&quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir .
&quot; but my cousin ...
&quot; he &apos;s shipping off in the morning
&quot; to the gulf for desert shield ,
&quot; and the kid &apos;s nervous .
&quot; he &apos;s scared .
&quot; so lou and i just figured we &apos;d just take the kid out ,
&quot; show him a good time , you know , get his mind off things .
and that way , at least he gets a proper send @-@ off , you know ? &quot;
the t.o. looks into clay &apos;s eyes ,
and after a couple of seconds ,
he says ... &quot; okay .
don &apos;t let it happen again . &quot;
and that was that .
i never seen anybody lie
with such confidence , such conviction .
if you would &apos;ve hooked clay up
to a polygraph right then and there ,
i &apos;m telling you , he would &apos;ve passed it .
but it ain &apos;t even so much the lying .
clay knew how to play on this man &apos;s emotions .
this morning ,
i &apos;m sitting on the bench outside the m.e. &apos; s office ,
and i &apos;m listening to him tell me how this went down .
and he &apos;s talking to me ,
and he &apos;s looking at me , and he &apos;s looking me right in the eye ,
and i &apos;m going for it , until my wife shows up .
and i get up and step back , and i watched him handle my wife .
and that little voice popped into my head saying ,
&quot; this guy is playing you . &quot;
he did this .
now , i can &apos;t prove it , but i know .
and i &apos;m telling you , i know like i know
whose name is on my driver &apos;s license !
he did this .
i know it .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s got to be in here .
i always carry an energy bar for an emergency .
and being trapped in this metal box
without any food and any water
is definitely an emergency , so ...
so was last tuesday .
what does that mean ?
i skipped breakfast ,
had the energy bar around 11 : 00 a.m. ,
and i forgot to replace it .
that &apos;s great .
now the only question is : do we starve to death
or die of dehydration first ?
oh , we &apos;ll die of dehydration
way before we get the chance to starve .
you know what , we have been in here for a few hours .
and with time , evidence can degrade ,
even disappear .
so i am gonna get started on
the external examination of our victim .
in here ? you &apos;re gonna do that in here ?
yeah . i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll be rescued soon ,
and when we are , you &apos;ll want to hit the ground running .
also , nothing takes your mind off your stomach
quite like an autopsy .
okay .
record my report , would you please ?
autopsy was begun at approximately
11 : 45 on april 3 , 2015 .
the victim is wearing a blue sport coat .
underneath , he is wearing
a blue and white striped shirt
that &apos;s been unbuttoned all the way down to his navel .
that &apos;s very strange .
the wound is not fully consistent with a gsw .
there are cuts around the edges
approximately an eighth of an inch in length
that were made postmortem .
so maybe the killer tried to take the slug out .
i &apos;m not finding anything .
so , killer shoots hurd ,
unbuttons his shirt , tries to take the bullet out
because he has a gun that is registered to him ,
and he &apos;s worried about ballistics .
do you have a magnifying glass ?
yeah .
thank you .
all right , good .
got a partial print on that button .
it &apos;s getting pretty humid in here .
you got anything we can preserve this evidence with ?
uh , not in there ,
but will you grab the compact out of my purse .
compact .
those things can be pretty airtight .
oh , look at you .
like a regular girl scout .
girl scout would &apos;ve replaced the energy bar , but thanks .
okay .
i mean , it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s just so hard , you know , having to ...
having to say it over and over .
okay , you know , i think you &apos;ve done enough for today .
hey .
oh , good , baby .
you &apos;re home .
would you please talk to him ?
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m good , man .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m ... i ...
i &apos;ve just been calling our family and friends ,
and giving them the news , and i @-@ i &apos;m just overwhelmed .
he hasn &apos;t eaten anything all day .
i don &apos;t have much of an appetite right now .
you know , i was gonna say maybe you should
lie down for a little while .
you know , clay , i think that might be a good idea .
i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you guys .
hey , thanks , man .
aw , man .
you get some rest , brother .
what &apos;s going on ?
where have you been ? i ...
look , honey , i &apos;ve been working on a case .
they can &apos;t cover for you ?
your oldest friend loses his wife ,
and they can &apos;t cover for you ? this ...
diane is the case .
i don &apos;t understand .
i think he &apos;s lying .
i think he may have done something to her .
what ?
lou , that &apos;s not possible .
honey , can you remember any time
you heard diane complain about clay ,
or complain about their marriage ?
anything like that ?
um ... no .
no , she said that everything was great .
they were looking forward to the trip .
they were making plans .
all right ...
hang on .
你要求的尸检已经做完了
well , that &apos;s the m.e.
diane &apos;s autopsy is finished .
autopsy ? my god .
sweetheart , listen to me , listen to me .
i need you to do something for me .
all right ?
now , when you &apos;re sure he &apos;s asleep ,
i need you to grab his phone and bring it down to me .
i need to see who he &apos;s been calling ,
i need to check his e @-@ mails .
baby , this is crazy . i &apos;m not ...
renee .
if he murdered diane , he &apos;s gonna pay for it .
and what if he didn &apos;t ?
what if you &apos;re wrong
and clay finds out that you suspected him ?
i &apos;ll deal with that when it &apos;s time to deal with that .
i can &apos;t think about that right now .
all i know is everything i &apos;ve learned
in 20 @-@ plus years as a cop is telling me he did this .
look , that &apos;s the m.e. again , baby .
please , please , just do this for me .
do this for me .
hey . it &apos;s been quiet .
everyone cleared out at 0800 .
got it . have a good day .
shoots .
no , clay . clay , it &apos;s just me .
it &apos;s just me .
sorry .
you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
i was just bringing you a glass of water .
i didn &apos;t mean to wake you .
cop reflexes-- i can &apos;t help them .
yeah , i toss and turn all night , too .
i would wake diane up all the time .
every night .
i &apos;d tell her , i &apos;ll go sleep in the guest room ,
but she wouldn &apos;t let me .
she &apos;d say she &apos;d ...
rather lie awake together than ...
than to sleep without me there , you know .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry about your wrist .
no , it &apos;s all right .
why don &apos;t you go back to sleep .
captain grover , thank you for coming .
all right , max , what do you got ?
well , as i suspected ,
the c.o.d. was blunt force trauma to the head
and torso caused by the fall .
but i didn &apos;t find evidence of foul play .
well , yeah , but you didn &apos;t find anything
that proves that she wasn &apos;t pushed , right ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
however , without conclusive evidence to the contrary ,
i have no choice but to rule mrs. maxwell &apos;s death as accidental .
i &apos;m sorry .
please don &apos;t fall , okay ?
only thing that &apos;d make this situation worse :
if i was stuck in here with two dead bodies .
oh , i am not gonna fall .
back home in carbondale ,
my brothers used to put me up on their shoulders ,
and i &apos;d climb over the fence at the local y ,
unlock the gate so we could use the pool after hours .
this thing is sealed from the other side .
i &apos;m never gonna get it open .
that &apos;s &apos; cause this place is a tomb .
hello ? !
is anyone there ? !
oh , my god .
pua , we &apos;re stuck in here !
get us out of here !
pua !
hang tight !
i &apos;m calling hfd to get you out !
lou .
i was just about to finish up here and , uh , head home .
renee , i can &apos;t prove this thing .
i can &apos;t prove it and ...

you need to finish what you started .
follow every lead .
20 @-@ plus years being a cop ,
and your instincts have never steered you wrong .
i know they &apos;ve gotten you out of some pretty tough situations .
and i know they &apos;ve also brought you home to me .
you trust them .
and i trust you .

i want you to at least drink something .
let me see what we have .
you know , i was looking for my phone .
uh , i thought i left it by the bed , but it &apos;s not there .

renee , where &apos;s my phone ?
clay ?

i &apos;ve been at the crime lab .
so , what , are you on a case ?
you &apos;re coming with me .
coming with you for what ?
you &apos;re under arrest for murdering your wife .
that &apos;s nice . richard yeager ?
what can i do for you guys ?
you can drop that club and put your hands behind your back ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re under arrest .
for what ?
for the murdering your business partner glenn hurd .
that was good that you took the slug out of his chest ,
but we found your .22 at home--
it &apos;s been fired recently .
and you left a fingerprint on the victim &apos;s clothing .
i want my lawyer .
okay . are you gonna lie to him or are you gonna tell him that
you killed your business partner because he found out you were
embezzling money from the company ?
all right , pua .
go ahead , book him .
i always wanted to know what this part was like .
yeah , well you had a nice front row seat .
thank you , uh , for helping me out
with that , uh , embarrassing episode earlier today .
hey , you know , if i ever get stuck in an elevator
with somebody ever again , i hope it &apos;s with you .
ditto , detective .
all right , good .
all right , let &apos;s go find an elevator , come on .
no !
come on , it &apos;ll be fun this time .
you really believe this , lou ?
you really think i could hurt diane ?
if you &apos;d asked me yesterday , i &apos;d have said no .
no way .
&apos;cause i loved you like a brother .
of course , you were counting on that .
25 years of friendship clouding my judgment .
making me ignore the signs .
you wanted your wife dead ,
but you damn sure didn &apos;t want to get caught .
that &apos;s why you did it here .
that &apos;s why you brought her here .
you needed to shut down any possibility
of any kind of investigation .
stop anybody from asking any hard questions , see ?
you thought i &apos;d do that for you .
your old partner-- figured i &apos;d have your back .
you used me .
but , see , you forget one thing , brother .
i know you .
and i saw right through you .
think about what you &apos;re saying , lou .
i loved my wife .
i loved diane .
you saw us at dinner . we were happy .
man , please ! that was all an act .
all that phony attention .
gold earrings and the love note . you didn &apos;t mean any of that .
you already knew what you were gonna do .
you kept that phony act up
all the way down to the last second .
how &apos;d you get her to the edge ?
what &apos;d you do , tell her you wanted to take her picture ?
with the mountains in the background ?
you smile at her ?
tell her you love her ?
she say she loved you , too ?
&quot; i love you , baby ! i love you , baby !
now , move back ; i just want to get these mountains in here &quot;
and then you start moving closer .
she probably thought you were moving in for another kiss .
not this time though .
this time you moved in ,
and you pushed her over that edge .
and you watched her fall .
and you watched her hit her head
and crack it open on those rocks !
that &apos;s a lie .
why would i do that to my wife ?
why ?
oldest reason in the world , brother .
oldest motive .
love .
leann stockwell .
one of your trainers at the gym .
one you &apos;ve been having
an affair with for over a year .
aw , those photos ?
yeah , these photos .
the photos you took on your phone and deleted them .
i got teenagers , man .
and you know what my teenagers taught me about technology ?
nothing gets deleted .
nothing ever goes away .
i talked to leann , clay .
she told me you wanted to leave your wife
and be with her .
so , what , what ? i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m a killer
because i lied to some piece i had on the side ?
is that &apos;s what you think ?
i think you wanted to start all over with some
fine young thing that just adored clay .
then you did the math .
and you sure as hell didn &apos;t want to live your retirement out
on half your pension in a small rented apartment
on the south side of chicago .
you know , i really don &apos;t even think it was the money .
i know how much you love people thinking you &apos;re such a good guy .
&quot; aw , that clay-- he &apos;s a great guy ! stand @-@ up guy ! &quot;
you just didn &apos;t want anybody to know
that you &apos;re the kind of guy
who &apos;d step out on his wife after 20 good years .
i &apos;m done with you .
you know , that &apos;s a great story , lou .
the thing is ...
you can &apos;t prove it .
not yet .
but you &apos;re gonna spend the night in a cell .
and i &apos;m gonna spend the night on a plane back to chicago ,
and i &apos;m gonna talk to leann in person .
and then i &apos;m gonna search your house .
and i &apos;m gonna search your car .
and i &apos;m gonna search your locker .
and i &apos;m gonna talk to your friends .
i &apos;m gonna talk to your neighbors .
i &apos;m gonna talk to your pastor .
i &apos;m gonna talk to everybody you know
down to the guy who shines your shoes !
and anything you think i can do to help you , clay--
any favor i could call in , any length that i could go to ,
any power or influence i might have--
i &apos;m gonna use all of that to lock your ass up !
smoke on that .
you could &apos;ve turned away .
you could &apos;ve squashed that little voice in your head .
let your friend walk .
but you didn &apos;t .
diane was my friend , too .
it &apos;s okay , baby .
come here , honey .
