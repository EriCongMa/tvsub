i asked noel to break into hanna &apos;s house tonight .
that &apos;s who was in the kitchen . it was noel .
hey , how &apos;s your mom ?
freaked .
guys , we needed to do that .
you saw tanner cornering me at school .
she &apos;s trying to poke holes in our story .
your story .
can you take this ?
give each of the girls a copy .
they need to memorize it .
you recorded that ?
would you let me borrow one of those cameras ?
the camera is for my sister .
she &apos;s connected to all of this .
aria , if you don &apos;t want me to get married ...
it has to do with you marrying zack .
was he inappropriate with you ?
maybe he was with hanna .
ali , where did that scar come from ,
the one on your thigh ?
caleb , this can &apos;t go on .
i &apos;m talking about hanna .
she &apos;s getting wasted in the middle of the day .
i &apos;m in noel &apos;s car
and he has pictures of alison .
he put them in the same envelope
as the tape he was listening to .
they caught him , the person
who broke in here last night .
alison , is that the man who kidnapped you ?
what &apos;s his name ?
cyrus petrillo .
how did you find him ?
mrs. marin &apos;s neighbor reported a man lurking
in her yard .
and he &apos;s admitted to everything ?
his story matches alison &apos;s .
the abduction , the blindfold , her escape .
i &apos;m telling you the same thing
i told ashley marin and your daughter .
not a word of this to anyone
until we get enough evidence to press charges .
we need to make sure that this man
is who he says he is .
lieutenant ...
where is she ?
it must be him .
is that him ?
is that the man who hurt you ?
i don &apos;t know .
you said you don &apos;t know ?
what was i supposed to say , spencer ?
how about &quot; no &quot; ?
i was blindfolded , remember ?
i &apos;m sorry , do we seriously have to remind you
that you were never actually kidnapped ?
there &apos;s a man being questioned by the police
right now for a crime that never happened .
guys , this is &quot; a. &quot;
i mean , you said he knew about the rock that hit you .
he knew where you were kept , what you ate ,
what mattress you slept on .
it &apos;s the same story that you told the doctor .
and holbrook , the night we got back from new york .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter where &quot; a &quot; got it .
what matters is what &quot; a &quot; is planning to do now .
if &quot; a &quot; is behind this , that &apos;s exactly
who that guy is gonna run to when he panics .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , if i can make him think
that he &apos;s gonna go down for this ,
we can follow him to &quot; a &quot; and finally win &quot; a &apos;s &quot; game .
great .
we win the game , we find out who &quot; a &quot; is .
what happens when we lose ?
is it weird that we haven &apos;t gotten
an &quot; a &quot; message about this yet ?
no , i don &apos;t need a creepy text to read the writing on the wall .
the second ali says that this guy kidnapped her ,
we &apos;re gonna figure out that cyrus petrillo &apos;s
a sheep farmer in montana and couldn &apos;t possibly have done this .
and then the whole world &apos;s gonna know
that ali &apos;s a big fat liar .
and us . right now ,
we &apos;re just as big and fat as she is .
hey , guys , keep your voices down .
yeah .
thank god the cops are here so we don &apos;t have
to worry about being imaginary kidnapped .
yeah , but once tanner figures out
that the kidnapping story is a lie ,
they &apos;re gonna figure out about new york and shana real quick .
ali &apos;s not an idiot .
she &apos;s not gonna walk right into an obvious &quot; a &quot; trap .
we don &apos;t know that anymore .
we all heard her in there . she &apos;s gone rogue .
okay , well , someone needs to go back in there
and make sure that she doesn &apos;t id this guy .
right , well , emily ?
yeah .
yeah .
spencer &apos;s the convincing one .
yeah , but you &apos;re the hardest to disappoint .
it &apos;s about your eyes .
awesome .
how &apos;s your mom doing ?
she &apos;s heartbroken .
god , it &apos;s so awful .
i mean , first your dad cheats on her
and then this sleazebag boyfriend hits on me .
hanna , she was there .
she doesn &apos;t need a play @-@ by @-@ play .
i &apos;m just sorry . that &apos;s all .
thanks .
you need a ride ?
yeah .
what is that ?
it &apos;s noel kahn &apos;s insurance policy .
it &apos;s everything that shana gave to jenna that proves that ali wasn &apos;t dead .
ali knew it was out there ,
she just didn &apos;t tell us about it .
tanner would sure love to get her hands on this .
yeah .
ali talking to shana when she &apos;s supposed to be dead .
you mean kidnapped .
ali doesn &apos;t know you have this , right ?
no , but i &apos;m headed to my house right now to stash it .
in your house ?
is it safe ?
i have a spot .
a spot ?
that nobody else knows about .
well , maybe you should tell us where this is .
you know , just in case anything were to happen to you .
good @-@ bye , hanna .
be careful please .
i will .
aria &apos;s right .
if you identify this guy , it will be way too easy
for &quot; a &quot; to prove that you &apos;re lying .
we don &apos;t even know who this cyrus person is
or where he came from .
i get it , em .
okay ? i do .
but i can &apos;t just say that this guy is innocent .
why not ?
ali , it &apos;s--
oh . emily , hi .
uh , i just got back from the station and , emily ,
could i have a word with ali ?
dad , i already told her .
al , you were not supposed to do that .
emily helped save my life .
she deserves to know what &apos;s going on .
the person you should be talking to is tanner .
that man knew every detail .
how would he know that unless he did it ?
he confessed already .
the police said this same man could have
killed your mom and bethany young .
we &apos;re all here to support you , al .
emily , all of your friends ,
we all want the same thing ...
to put this man away for a very long time .
yeah .
we ...
all want you safe .
whatever you &apos;re afraid of , please , don &apos;t be .
this man is behind bars
and all we have to do is keep him there .
yes , i know i just made the appointment ,
but the situation has changed .
no , i don &apos;t need to reschedule ,
because i don &apos;t need to book a banquet hall
for a party of one .
mom ?
mom , you don &apos;t have to do that right now .
i just want to get it over with .
well , mike says that you haven &apos;t eaten all day .
it &apos;s pesto and mozzarella .
it &apos;s your favorite .
it was incredibly sweet of you to make this for me , honey ,
but i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m up to eating .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
i should have seen this coming .
i was too old for him , i was too trusting .
mom ...
mom , this has nothing to do with your age .
this isn &apos;t your fault .
there were signs , aria ,
and i just drove right past them .
because i wanted to believe that it could work ,
i wanted to believe that he could change .
you &apos;re the one that taught me that second chances exist .
your bliss is still ahead of you .
honey , when i said that , i was talking about zack .
okay .
why don &apos;t you let me make the rest of these calls , okay ?
the last thing you need to do is recount
your break @-@ up to a bunch of strangers .
how the hell did &quot; a &quot; get somebody to confess ?
i don &apos;t know .
what &apos;s ali gonna do ?
whatever the hell she wants .
don &apos;t you think you should find out what that is ?
nope .
uh , i was eating that .
hanna .
hanna , what are you doing ?
none of this stuff is good for you .
soda , beer , soggy nachos ?
it &apos;s poison , caleb .
when was the last time we ate a vegetable
that wasn &apos;t battered and fried ?
you know what ? enough trash talking my diet .
what is going on ?
nothing .
just another day in the life of alison dilaurentis .
she &apos;s in the driver &apos;s seat of my life
and i &apos;m supposed to watch her just steer me off a cliff ?
i &apos;m sick of it .
okay , well then , toss her , not my fried zucchini .
you know , the other day ms. adinolfi
made an announcement about chorus auditions for a solo
and all the girls are freaking out .
then i thought , wow , what &apos;s that like ?
to lose sleep over some stupid chorus audition .
i mean , is that what normal people do ?
they go to football games and wave pompoms
and freak out over a chorus solo ?
normal people are not being hounded by &quot; a. &quot;
besides , you don &apos;t care about that stuff .
well , maybe i should .
look , i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m gonna do about alison ,
but i am going to that stupid audition .
hey , how &apos;d it go with ali ?
unclear .
mr. d. kind of kicked me out .
did you find a place for the ...
thing you got from you @-@ know @-@ who ?
you speaking in code now ?
seems like a good idea .
roger wilco .
we still need a more permanent solution ,
but i &apos;ve got a temporary one .
what are you up to ?
avoiding the brew as much as possible .
zack went back to austria , but the place is still tainted .
have you ever tried blue light cafe ?
no .
good . well , don &apos;t .
okay .
what &apos;s going on , spencer ?
it &apos;s gone .
what &apos;s gone ?
the recording ali gave me and the medical exam , it &apos;s gone .
gone as in &quot; stolen &quot; or gone as in--
no , this isn &apos;t code , emily . it &apos;s gone as in &quot; it &apos;s not here . &quot;
just give me a second , okay ?
spencer ?
spencer ?
need any help ?
i thought you left already .
we forgot the grocery list .
looking for something or just redecorating ?
i just ...
i dropped my pen .
what do you want , melissa ?
mom wanted me to check , see if you &apos;d like
anything special for dinner tonight .
take it . i &apos;ll wait .
emily , i &apos;ll have to call you back later .
he followed me into my yard
and then he hit me with that rock .
next thing i knew i woke up blindfolded .
i can &apos;t sleep .
even now .
i can still hear him breathing .
something wrong ?
just tell mom we &apos;re out of peanut butter , okay ?
i &apos;m really glad that we &apos;re doing this .
me , too . you good ?
yeah . great .
are we almost done ?
is that spencer ?
maybe we should just go back the other way .
it &apos;s a loop , hanna .
hanna ?
when your mom said you were out on a run ,
i thought she was joking .
well , seeing is believing , spencer .
caleb , can you just give us a second ?
no .
no ?
no , we &apos;re doing a loop .
hanna , this is important !
fine . look , i just stayed up all night looking through
the surveillance footage of my backyard ,
trying to figure out who took the recording of ali--
okay , whatever it is , i &apos;m just not interested .
you don &apos;t even know what it is yet .
look , i have to be at that audition in an hour .
i have to go .
what audition ?
hanna , are you seriously running away from me ?
i &apos;m faster than you , hanna ! i have a car .
hey , just lay off , spence .
what is going on ?
you asked me to help hanna .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
just watch the bushes .
who is that ?
just watch .
she just gave him something , right ?
yeah .
that &apos;s not all .
watch what she &apos;s saying .
do it . trust me .
do it .
when was this ?
it was three nights ago .
less than 24 hours before cyrus petrillo confessed .
what , you think the guy in the video
in your backyard is ali &apos;s fake kidnapper ?
that melissa stole the recording and gave it to him ?
i mean , we already know she &apos;s working for mona ,
so why not &quot; a , &quot; too ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s gonna make my head explode .
that &apos;s why .
oh , my god , do you think that melissa sent that text ?
maybe .
i mean , she always liked chess .
look , aria , we cannot take anymore chances .
we have to cut the cord with ali
before she drags us down with her .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying we use what we got from noel .
the pictures , the conversations with shana ,
&apos;cause they prove that ali was alive
and decidedly un @-@ kidnapped for the past 2 years .
okay . and that helps us how ?
we go to tanner and we tell her the truth ,
that we thought that ali was dead
up until ravenswood .
the only thing that we know about the past 2 years
is whatever ali told us , that she lied to us ,
just like she lied to them .
okay . but what about new york ?
we can &apos;t just come half clean .
i know .
but we tell her what happened there , too ,
that it was self @-@ defense and you were protecting us .
that &apos;s the truth .
but the truth doesn &apos;t amount to much
when it comes from a bunch of liars .
spencer , the whole reason i &apos;m freaking out
about this cyrus thing
is that it could lead tanner to the theater .
and now you want to beat &quot; a &quot; to the punch ?
exactly .
because it &apos;s better if they find out from us .
so what are you saying ,
that alison might say this guy &apos;s guilty ?
yeah .
she thinks that he &apos;s gonna lead her to &quot; a , &quot;
when really &quot; a &quot; &apos; s gonna make this
whole confession lead tanner back to us .
but she wouldn &apos;t do that .
she &apos;s crazy , but she &apos;s not stupid .
yeah , i thought so , too .
but a whole day has passed and this guy ,
he &apos;s still sitting in jail .
everything &apos;s gone , right ?
the book , the research , the photos of ali , all of it ?
because if tanner comes here--
aria , you were the one that sent spencer
over to help me move everything .
remember ?
she &apos;s very thorough . you and i both know that .
where is she ?
who ? spencer ?
no . alison .
why ?
because i want to talk to her , that &apos;s why .
no . no , you &apos;re not .
you just got your stitches out , ezra .
you &apos;re about to take a bike ride
for the first time in god knows how long .
you just got the all @-@ clear from your doctor .
you &apos;re okay again . you &apos;re really okay , and--
no , i-- i &apos;m not gonna allow you to jump back on
ali &apos;s crazy train .
not with tanner circling
and &quot; a &quot; watching our every move .
no .
aria--
no . promise me you won &apos;t speak to her .
please .
i like knowing that you &apos;re safe .
okay .
okay , i promise .
how long till your dad gets back ?
about an hour .
he &apos;s meeting with a social worker .
why ?
he thinks i &apos;m afraid of retribution .
he thinks that &apos;s the reason
why you don &apos;t want to id this guy ?
look , i know your dad is putting pressure on you .
okay ? i--
i know he &apos;s convinced
that this is the guy who took you
and killed your mom and bethany young .
and i &apos;m sure tanner would love to wrap up
all three nightmares with a neat little bow
and you ...
what about me ?
you love that , for once , everyone seems to believe you .
that &apos;s not what this is about .
good .
&apos;cause , i swear , if you let some stranger go to jail
because you &apos;re trying to cover your ass--
he &apos;s not a stranger , emily .
who ? cyrus ?
what do you mean &quot; he &apos;s not a stranger &quot; ?
do you know him ?
i don &apos;t know how &quot; a &quot; found him ...
but ...
he &apos;s the one who gave me this .
you were living with this person ?
in an abandoned basement ?
did he know who you were ?
just that i was on the run .
he said he could tell that i was different .
special .
what happened , ali ?
he didn &apos;t want me .
he just wanted my stuff ...
my money .
and the way he looked at me ...
like i was nothing to him .
worse than nothing .
i &apos;m sorry , ali .
but &quot; a &quot; is using this creep to trap you ,
to trap all of us .
&quot; a &quot; wants you to identify him .
you have to let him go .
you know that , right ?
i know .
okay ! mona , we get it .
you can freaking sing .
okay .
next up , we have jamie demayo ,
hanna marin , ronni high
and mona vanderwaal .
come on in , girls .
mona !
mona !
you were supposed to meet me outside my house ,
not in my room .
your mom let me in on her way out .
she made me some snacks .
carrot stick ?
i don &apos;t want this in my house .
if it &apos;s not safe at your place , it &apos;s not safe at mine .
is that &quot; a &quot; again ?
no , it &apos;s noel kahn .
he wants his loot back .
okay , don &apos;t answer .
no , i have to .
we might need him .
what if he has more pictures
or information that we can use ?
use for what ?
to turn on our friend ?
aria filled me in on your great idea .
it &apos;s not gonna happen , spencer .
what we should be doing is burning this stuff .
emily ...
ali is not our friend right now .
she &apos;s a dangerous person who has no problem
gambling with our lives .
she &apos;s not dangerous , she &apos;s hurt .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
she doesn &apos;t want me to tell you .
oh , no , of course , she doesn &apos;t .
it &apos;s always the same with you two , isn &apos;t it ?
just trust me , okay ?
she &apos;s not gonna id this guy .
she &apos;s gonna wait out the 48 hours
and after that the cops have to let him go ,
and it &apos;s all over .
and you believe her ?
after all the lies she &apos;s told ?
i do .
we &apos;re either all in this together or we &apos;re not .
ali &apos;s not the problem , spencer .
melissa is .
she &apos;s the one that gave cyrus
the recording of ali &apos;s medical exam .
i did my part , i talked to ali .
if you really want to help , talk to your sister .
mona ?
mona , can you hear me ?
what happened ?
where am i ?
no , no . lay down .
mona , you fainted .
you were out for almost a minute .
where &apos;s my bag ?
it &apos;s over there .
ms. adinolfi is on the phone with your mom .
give it to me .
i need my bag .
your mom &apos;s on her way .
what can i get for you ?
juice ?
maybe some water ?
how &apos;s your head ?
anything hurt or--
hanna , my bag .
you are not in this alone .
a lot of people have supported you ,
done whatever you &apos;ve asked ,
gone along with all your stories .
is this a threat ?
no .
right now it &apos;s an observation .
did aria ask you to talk to me ?
because if one more person tells me what i should do ,
i swear i &apos;m gonna scream .
can i help you ?
if there &apos;s something you need to tell my daughter ,
you can talk to me or with the police .
oh , no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i was just saying hello .
you okay ?
was he bothering you ?
it &apos;s fine , dad .
we don &apos;t have much time .
alison , they have to release him
after 48 hours .
now , i know this is hard ,
but we really have to go .
you know , i think i &apos;m just gonna get a refill .
two minutes .
looks like you recovered quickly .
you followed me ?
yep .
whose car is this ?
is this a rental ?
you really go full out .
hanna--
mona , there was a mug shot
of cyrus petrillo in your bag .
so either you set this whole thing up
or you &apos;ve been bluescarfing the inside scoop .
snarfing , bluesnarfing .
and no , i didn &apos;t set this up .
i &apos;m here to find out who did .
great . me , too .
what does this thing do ?
hanna , get out .
look , mona , we both know that ali brings out
the &quot; a &quot; in you .
so whether you &apos;re behind this or not ,
i don &apos;t trust you one bit .
and i &apos;m not leaving here until i find answers ,
either from you or that doohickey .
fine .
what are you doing ?
if you won &apos;t leave , i will .
are you sure you want to do that ?
where are they going ?
what do we do now ?
we do nothing .
mona , we have to find out where they &apos;re going .
we have to follow them .
do something !
no need to follow .
i just got access to tanner &apos;s phone .
170 to control .
transporting witness to 5th street house
for possible identification .
18 : 54 .
take off your seatbelt , hanna .
we &apos;re not here to follow her .
we &apos;re here to follow him .
what did you say to her ?
that her actions have consequences .
what about yours ?
were you even listening when i asked you not to talk to her ?
yes , i was .
and you sought her out anyway ?
i ... i didn &apos;t ...
here , let me just--
no , i got it .
okay .
i didn &apos;t seek her out .
i saw her , i made a split decision
and i walked over .
right in the middle of town .
right in front of her dad .
and what if tanner saw you ?
once she figures out that you and alison are connected ,
it is over .
you get that , right ?
i &apos;m sorry , aria . i really am .
i was just trying to help out
and the only way i knew how--
by lying to me .
by talking to alison .
yeah , the one thing i asked--
because--
the one thing i asked you not to do .
why are you this upset ?
find what you were looking for ?
you were certainly in there for long enough .
i was missing my blue sweater .
you know that one with the buttons ?
i thought maybe it ended up in the barn .
any luck ?
no , not really .
i saw your computer .
i know you &apos;re looking at flights .
london .
zurich . taiwan .
so are you planning a vacation
or are you running away ?
how is that any of your business ?
i don &apos;t know , melissa . is it ?
i know you &apos;re helping mona , okay ?
and now ...
is somebody making you do something
that you don &apos;t want to do ?
are you trying to run away ?
is this what it &apos;s come to ?
searching each other &apos;s rooms ,
looking for answers to questions
that we &apos;re too afraid to ask ?
i only helped mona
because i wanted you to see that
ali hasn &apos;t changed .
she &apos;s as toxic as ever .
we both know ali wasn &apos;t kidnapped .
but sooner or later , she is gonna get what she deserves .
and i do not want you standing too close
when that happens .
so all of this is just sisterly concern ?
is it really that hard to believe ?
what did you do , melissa ?
and i &apos;m asking you to your face this time .
i can &apos;t tell you .
not yet .
you &apos;re my sister !
does that mean nothing to you ?
it means you should know that ...
honesty does not come easy for this family .
okay , well , we can improve upon our genetics , huh ?
let &apos;s at least try .
i &apos;m trying , spencer !
it is not safe for me here ...
or for you .
maybe you should come with me .
this is where he said he kept you .
the property has been abandoned for years .
not a lot of neighbors around either .
al , you okay ?
cyrus petrillo may have confessed ,
but we don &apos;t have the physical evidence
we need to charge him
and our 48 @-@ hour hold is running out .
i know this is difficult ,
but since you can &apos;t identify your abductor ,
i need you to try and remember this space .
come on .
i want you to meet my friends .
this is crazy .
hey , guys .
this is cyrus .
my bag !
hey , get off me !
you remember this place ?
i can never forget it .
how long before they release him ?
according to tanner &apos;s emails ,
it could be any minute .
he could go out the front or the back .
well , i would say we should split up ,
but i wouldn &apos;t trust you telling me what you saw .
well , the feeling &apos;s mutual .
why did you tell miss adinolfi
that you fainted because of a panic attack ?
because i did .
since when do you have panic attacks ?
since when do you get sauced before third period ?
well , i &apos;ll say it if you won &apos;t .
since ali came back .
why do you think i went on the offensive ?
she scares me to death .
i just ...
didn &apos;t want to face her alone .
hey , caleb .
sorry , i haven &apos;t called you back .
the audition ?
it went great .
but there were a lot of other girls there ,
so i probably won &apos;t get it .
but i &apos;m just about to sit down with my mom for dinner
so i &apos;ll call you after , okay ?
okay , bye .
lying to your boyfriend again .
nice .
oh , please .
like mike montgomery knows a single real thing about you .
170 to control .
witness has identified 5th street house .
eta to the courthouse , 8 minutes .
do not release suspect in holding .
i repeat , do not release cyrus petrillo .
i &apos;m the one confusing things , em .
i can &apos;t trust ezra .
i don &apos;t .
and people don &apos;t just change because you want them to .
hey , can i call you back ?
i heard that you went out .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
my attempt to jumpstart my single life .
i may have gone a little overboard .
would you wear this ?
yes .
which is why you shouldn &apos;t .
i thought so .
so you &apos;re talking again ...
to ezra ?
that was just emily on the phone .
but , yeah ,
we &apos;re--we &apos;re talking .
honey , i went through two boxes of tissues yesterday
and bared my soul to you about thirteen times .
you can talk to me .
please .
i thought he was gone , mom .
really gone .
the whole time he was in the hospital ,
i was just making up this list
of the things that i &apos;d tell him if i just got one more chance .
and now he &apos;s okay
and i &apos;m so glad that he &apos;s okay .
but i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m stuck with that list still .
and there &apos;s all these thoughts and there &apos;s all these feelings
that are just bashing around in my head
every single time that i see him .
and i want to be able to trust him again .
just start over .
but you &apos;re right , people don &apos;t change .
aria , honey , that &apos;s not true .
people can change .
i know because i &apos;ve changed .
you &apos;ve changed .
even your dad has changed .
your dad was the one
who got me up off the couch this morning .
okay , it was the ricotta pancakes .
i know it &apos;s a small thing ,
but he used to be incapable of making anything
in a skillet without turning it black .
mom , you don &apos;t have to try to make me feel better .
aria , listen to me .
i don &apos;t know what exactly happened with ezra ,
but i do know that zack
is not gonna write the book on relationships in this family .
not if i have anything to say about it .
艾莉找出赛勒斯是谁了 需要见面
is that him ?
em ?
ali , can i talk to you ?
dad , i &apos;ll be right in .
okay .
you heard .
yeah .
but i didn &apos;t understand .
you identified him ?
ali , i thought we were in this together .
we are .
no .
we &apos;re not .
whatever &quot; a &quot; has planned
affects all of us , not just you .
i waited as long as i could .
everyone was looking at me , being in that place .
you weren &apos;t there , em .
when ?
when wasn &apos;t i there ?
when hanna broke her leg because of &quot; a &quot; ?
when i almost died in an elevator
because i was trying to find out who killed you ?
or when spencer had to check into radley
because of everything your disappearance put us through ?
the past several years haven &apos;t been easy for any of us ,
but what makes it okay is that we stick together .
we don &apos;t turn on each other .
i have a plan .
i &apos;m sure you do .
the problem is you &apos;ll throw us all under a bus
just to pull it off .
i stuck up for you against paige , against spencer ,
against everyone .
i wasted so much time on you .
emily .
i &apos;m gonna make it right .
i am .
i can still find out who &quot; a &quot; is .
please .
i &apos;m done , ali .
i am so done with you .
if ali identified the guy , then how did he get away ?
once the clock struck 8 : 10 , he was a free man .
&quot; a &quot; must have had a getaway car out back .
by the time tanner called in the id , he was gone .
gone or not , &quot; a &quot; could still use this against you .
yeah , i know .
but spencer has a plan .
a good one ?
no .
it &apos;s awful .
even for spencer .
look , i &apos;m sorry , caleb .
i shouldn &apos;t have lied to you .
i just ...
after everything i said yesterday ,
i didn &apos;t want to tell you that i was in a car
with mona spying on ali .
hanna , we can &apos;t get control back
by avoiding what &apos;s going on .
if it makes you feel any better ...
i didn &apos;t exactly have a kale salad for lunch .
no ?
try a bacon calzone .
give me a call if you need anything , okay ?
i will .
i love you .
&quot; sooner or later ,
ali &apos;s gonna get what she deserves . &quot;
that &apos;s what she said ?
yeah .
melissa basically admitted
that &quot; a &quot; has something terrible in store for ali and us .
look , it &apos;s not too late , aria .
we can go to tanner .
we can tell her the truth about ali .
god , no . i know .
you &apos;ve mentioned that like 16 times already .
fine .
what are you smiling about ?
it &apos;s just a smile , spencer .
don &apos;t sound so concerned .
any word on emily ?
no , not yet .
you guys , i know i said that this might happen ,
but i still can &apos;t believe it .
ali walking into an &quot; a &quot; trap with both eyes open ?
me neither .
em ?
are you okay ?
you were right , spencer .
we can &apos;t trust alison .
not after tonight .
not you , too .
look , i know that this affects you more than the rest of us .
okay , i know that .
but i really hope you can get on board .
we need to cut ties with ali now .
tonight .
i was beginning to think you might not show .
there &apos;s a warrant out for my arrest .
i barely made it out in time .
that wasn &apos;t the deal we made .
you &apos;re lucky there was even a deal at all .
i should have left you for dead when i found you .
no one would miss you , cy .
not for a second .
you know i could have told them the truth about you .
how we met .
all the fun we had together .
so could i.
then we &apos;d both lose .
now we both win .
i found you once
and you can bet your life i can find you again .
this is your one chance to start over , cy .
you better use it .
the way you &apos;ve used it , ali ?
spencer , you &apos;re right .
i have to tell you the truth before it &apos;s too late .
if you &apos;re just joining us ,
you &apos;re watching the 42nd annual pennsylvania dog show .
let &apos;s check back in with our ...
