第二十六季第五集
pork chops with gravy !
wait . but today &apos;s not pork chop tuesday .
or gravy thursday !
i also set up some mirrors
so you could watch hockey fights while you eat .
oh , i love canadian @-@ on @-@ canadian violence .
oh , baby , this is so great !
thank you so much .
i &apos;m just happy you &apos;re happy .
wait a minute , that &apos;s not something people really feel .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , i do have a favor .
patty and selma came home early from their vacation ,
but the cleaners still haven &apos;t gotten all the black mold
out of their apartment .
so they need a place to stay .
here .
paris was a bust .
they wouldn &apos;t even let us see the mona lisa .
they kept yelling , &quot; la joconde !
her smile will die ! &quot;
no , marge , no !
you can &apos;t invite a couple of riddlers
to stay in the bat cave !
you ate the food and looked in the mirrors .
they &apos;re staying !
oh , honey , one teensy problem with this plan .
i &apos;m a teensy bit concerned
about them smoking around the children .
you know , their lungs are so teensy .
he has a point .
no , no . no , no , we don &apos;t have to smoke .
we can stop whenever we want . see ?
okay , how about this--
if you catch us smoking in the house ,
even one time , you can throw us out on the street .
you know what ? i trust them not to smoke .
and if you trust them , i trust them , too .
safety first !
screw this . we &apos;ll just go outside .
nature is god &apos;s ashtray .
bad news , bears .
forecast calls for nothing but rain .
here we go . problem solved .
electric cigarettes .
choke on our harmless fumes .
well , if you fall asleep with them ,
will you even burn to death ?
they call these cigarettes ?
they don &apos;t stain my fingers , my hair smells like hair ,
and what do i stub out in my scrambled eggs ?
sure , it &apos;s got the nicotine , but where &apos;s the tar ?
where &apos;s the stab from every breath
that reminds me i &apos;m alive ?
no smoke detector ! let &apos;s roll !
wait , wait .
turn on the faucet so no one &apos;ll get suspicious .
aha ! i gotcha !
you can &apos;t resist smoking in the house any more
than i can resist drinking in the car .
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know .
the water caught on fire .
and now i banish you from paradise .
i &apos;m glad i never bothered to learn which one of you is which .
please , show some compassion for two good people
who just can &apos;t stop smoking .
i know just the place .
tobacco !
who needs paris ?
this is our city of lights !
flaming tap water .
i saw something about that in a documentary .
地球 死期将至
sad . sad . sad . sad . sad . sad .
sad . sad . sad .
cute .
丽莎 · 辛普森最近看过的 笼罩全球的天然气
this one !
in this rural community , hydraulic fracturing , or fracking ,
was greeted as a windfall .
by pumping high @-@ pressure liquid
into underground shale deposits ,
fracking releases natural gas ,
but can lead to devastating environmental consequences .
yep , used to be you could try burning your water all day
and nothing would happen .
henry , did you remember
to turn off the slip &apos; n slide ?
well , i ... reckon not .
i think someone is fracking under our neighborhood .
and i know who .
it &apos;s you , mr. texan . oil wasn &apos;t enough--
now you &apos;re going after our natural gas .
aw , now , ain &apos;t nothing natural about gas .
if you can &apos;t dance in it , i ain &apos;t drilling for it .
i don &apos;t do this for the money ,
it &apos;s the dancing .
it &apos;s always been the dancing .
all right !
oh , man .
he made us watch him dance for three hours ,
and he really only has one move .
if someone was fracking in our neighborhood ,
wouldn &apos;t we know it ?
maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue .
长青田园
hmm , this is clearly a fracking site .
how are they keeping people away ?
aw , it &apos;s a terrific sport ...
shh !
this whole building is just a facade
for a drilling operation .
indeed it is .
evergreen terrace is built atop a massive shale deposit .
下面都是页岩
think of it-- all that poor natural gas
trapped underneath your shanties and lean @-@ tos .
smithers , give these two brats what they deserve
for sticking their noses in my business .
stopping mr. burns may be beyond the power
of an eight @-@ year @-@ old girl
with a book report due on beezus and ramona ,
but i know someone who can help :
the first female speaker of the state assembly ,
a politician who would never ignore
a fellow environmentalist in need ,
请愿文件
my hero , maxine lombard .
charge the electric limo-- we &apos;re going to springfield .
what about your cool @-@ down period ?
what about it ? !
lisa ! motorcade !
assemblywoman lombard !
you got my e @-@ mails !
i &apos;ll go anywhere , anytime ,
to defend our precious bay area values .
terrible !
just shocking .
d @-@ does anybody have a baby we can hold near the flames ?
i guess i do .
i &apos;m gonna hit this mr. burns
with a politician &apos;s most powerful weapon :
an invitation to a committee hearing .
决议号7066b
mr. burns , do you admit that you illegally pump toxic
chemicals into the groundwater below evergreen terrace ?
i ... don &apos;t recall .
mr. burns !
have you no regard for the life and health
of your fellow human beings ?
i ... don &apos;t recall .
you can &apos;t drill underneath people &apos;s homes
without their permission .
as chairwoman of this committee on energy ,
natural resources and blimp safety ,
your fracking operation is hereby shut down .
i demand to see that
capitalism @-@ castrating suffragette this instant !
you haven &apos;t bested me .
i will find a way to shatter that shale .
what makes men like you think you can do
whatever you want to our planet ?
maybe the planet wants a strong man
to take her by the hand and lead her .
you don &apos;t know what the planet wants .
oh , and i suppose you do ?
the planet wants to be protected and nourished
and maybe even ...
kissed .
wait a minute , i &apos;m not having a stroke , am i ?
no . am i ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , good .
you !
me ?
this was all a mistake-- an impulsive ...
reckless ...
knee @-@ buckling ...
spat @-@ snapping ...
spanx @-@ shredding mistake .
oh , it was great .
best i &apos;ve ever had .
and that includes ...
nellie taft .
so , monty , shall we find a way to continue this ...
purely passionate affair ?
but you &apos;re a softhearted liberal !
and you &apos;re a hard @-@ hearted capitalist .
enemies by day , lovers by night .
now , get out of my office .
as soon as i collect my things .
uh , derringer , sword cane ,
derringer cane , sword derringer .
all right , it &apos;s all here .
if i want to resume fracking ,
i have to buy the mineral rights
for every single parcel of land in evergreen terrace .
to win people over , i &apos;ll need a salesman
whose folksy facade masks a deep gusher of greed .
congratulations , simpson ! you &apos;re now my chief
energy innovation marketing officer .
whoo @-@ hoo !
all you &apos;ve got to do is sell fracking
to your friends and neighbors .
whoo @-@ hoo ? i don &apos;t know ,
&quot; fracking &quot; is one of those scary lisa words .
bah ! fracking produces enough clean natural gas
to make america independent of sheiks , caliphs and ...
scandinavians .
not to mention , it doesn &apos;t create
any of that awful worker @-@ mutating nuclear waste .
homer , game starts in an hour .
don &apos;t forget to set your fantasy lineup .
thanks , charlie .
maybe fracking isn &apos;t so bad .
then say yes to this raise , this promotion
and this flannel shirt , which says :
&quot; i &apos;m not screwing you over . &quot;
i &apos;m not screwing you over .
no , uh , i &apos;m not screwing you over .
i &apos;m not screwing you over .
i &apos;m so proud of you , papa .
some folks will tell you that fracking &apos;s no good ,
but what they don &apos;t tell you is ,
hydraulic fracturing creates jobs .
and all those new workers are gonna want
to spend their earnings buying what you &apos;re selling-- beer .
authentic italian food .
useless left @-@ handed crap .
magical nonsense .
expensive toys for grown @-@ ups they don &apos;t open or play with .
pornography and nachos .
high @-@ quality spanish @-@ language programming .
high @-@ quality methamphetamines .
laundry , homework , pranks , poop , poop and poop .
but our water was on fire .
how could you sell fracking for mr. burns ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve never gotten a promotion before .
once i thought i had , but it turned out
to be a beautifully @-@ worded firing ,
so judge me all you want .
i am judging you .
good . judge away .
judge , judge , judge , judge , judge .
don &apos;t care . don &apos;t care .
judge , judge , judge , judge , judge , judge .
don &apos;t care . don &apos;t care .
judge , judge , judge .
judge , judge .
don &apos;t care . don &apos;t care .
pumping frack cash .
it &apos;s a gas cash ... blast ?
residents of evergreen terrace are undecided
whether to sell their mineral rights to mr. burns .
mr. burns is a vampire sucking the lifeblood of this town
and lining his coffin with cash .
oh , maxine , no one insults me in a sound bite the way you do .
oh , monty , you &apos;re such a sexy little nosferatu .
same time tomorrow night ?
i &apos;ll bring the oxygen .
better bring two tanks .
and so , we see a clear correlation
between industrial hydro compounds
and water table contamination
well outside the ...
margin of error .
mr. simpson , rebuttal ?
everyone who signs over their mineral rights
to mr. burns gets $ 5,000 .
5,000 smackers ? !
money is like a job you don &apos;t even have to do !
ay , dinero .
signing stu .
i think my arguments were more cogent-- bo @-@ hyvik .
what ? !
cogent-- bo @-@ hyvik !
mr. burns , we did it !
everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights !
excellent .
no , no . it &apos;s excellent . it &apos;s excellent .
maybe you can help me , simpson .
you &apos;ve had a relationship or two in your life .
well ... one .
i have embarked on a &quot; beneficial friendship &quot;
with a woman with whom i have nothing in common .
her opinions are abhorrent to me , but the passion .
well , look at these racy texts she sends me .
oh , baby .
how long can i sustain this high @-@ wire act
of loathing and lust ?
well , i &apos;m no carl when it comes to this stuff ,
but i ain &apos;t no lenny , neither .
and i would say ...
no matter how much you try to keep things casual ,
someone always gets hurt .
hmm . well , then i must harden my heart against such an outcome .
i appreciate the counsel , simpson .
now , please trap @-@ door yourself out .
glad i could be of help !
do you have the signed gas leases ?
重启暂停水力压裂
hold on .
this feels light .
one of these deeds is missing a signature .
the gas rights transfer form for 742 evergreen terrace
was never signed by ... marge simpson .
marge , why didn &apos;t you sign ?
our water was on fire !
i &apos;m sorry , but the law states
that unless every single resident sells their rights ,
burns can &apos;t frack drop one !
oh , i was counting on that money
to pay for my other calf implant .
yuck .
i already felt the pride of energy independence .
marge simpson , i &apos;m as mad at you
as you usually are at me !
cheer up , monty .
all you lost was money ,
but what you get is ... me .
all i lost was money ?
let me make one thing perfectly clear .
our dalliance meant nothing to me !
you were but a sprig of parsley garnishing my beefsteak .
now i cast you aside for the busboys to gnaw upon .
considered this ill @-@ conceived affair terminated !
i played this just perfectly .
oh , yeah , great . great , marge , great work .
thanks to you ,
springfield will never be a natural gas boomtown ,
and like all boomtowns ,
it would have lasted forever .
oh ! our water was on fire !
oh ! was on fire . was !
i finally got a job i was good at ,
and now i have to give it up !
so , you &apos;ve come begging not to be fired ?
smithers , turn my back on this man !
maximum huff !
wait , mr. burns . i &apos;m here to man up .
it was all my wife &apos;s fault !
sometimes i think she and i have nothing in common !
nothing in common , eh ? tell me more .
marge likes sushi .
i like gum that squirts in your mouth .
she &apos;s into romantic comedies .
i like movies where there &apos;s only
one day a year when murder is legal .
yup , marge and i see the world in totally different ways .
different , exactly .
that &apos;s why i had to give my woman the old heave @-@ ho .
so , you don &apos;t miss that politics lady at all ?
not for one tiny second .
and i &apos;m sure she &apos;s forgotten all about me .
killdozers .
whatever are you doing , man ? !
we &apos;re tearing down this place
and putting up a recycling center ,
slash native american history museum ,
slash condor sanctuary .
a project this bloated and ill thought out
could only be the work of an angry liberal .
maxine !
my ex is using the thing i hate most against me--
big government .
stop this ribbon cutting !
this is private property !
what &apos;s the matter , mr. burns ?
never heard of eminent domain ?
you &apos;re just doing this to get back at me for dumping you !
that is ridiculous .
州众议院院长玛克辛 · 隆巴德
the antonin scalia bedroom !
现任美国最高法院大法官
it &apos;s a national public radio broadcast center now .
who are you ?
i &apos;m robert siegel and this is all things considered .
stop laying about , you !
there &apos;s work to be done !
or gravy thursday .
if that woman thinks she &apos;s been scorned now ,
she ain &apos;t seen nothing yet !
it &apos;s fracking time .
is one of the side effects of fracking , earthquakes ?
yes !
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re destroying this neighborhood .
just like you destroyed my mansion .
i don &apos;t know what i ever saw in you ,
you planet @-@ ruining monster !
likewise , you planet @-@ saving succubus !
homer , turn off that horrible machine !
you don &apos;t know anything about hydraulic fracturing !
you &apos;ve just been brainwashed by liberal tv shows
who use fracking as an easy bad guy ,
but it can save this country !
our ... water ... was ...
on ... fire !
wait . i finally get what you &apos;re saying .
fracking is great ,
but the only place it should ever happen is in other people &apos;s towns !
you always do the right thing ... sort of .
what is he doing ?
he was furious at that woman ,
now he &apos;s embracing her .
he told me himself they had nothing in common .
nothing except passion .
i was a fool to break up with you , maxine .
i &apos;m sorry i turned your home into a liberal paradise .
you think we could make us work ?
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;re pretty different .
but we &apos;ve got passion ,
and as long as we &apos;ve got that ,
our lives will never get boring .
well , there &apos;s free jazz on saturdays at the art museum .
具有令皮肤焕发青春健康 促进心血管健全等功效
now they say omega @-@ 3 pills are bad for you .
my sister &apos;s dog had puppies .
what kind ?
what kind of what ?
what kind of dog does your sister have ?
i don &apos;t know .
what color drawer pulls did you want ?
nickel or brush nickel ?
oh , i wish we &apos;d bought the more expensive theater tickets .
i &apos;ll never see anything in row bb .
there &apos;s a sale on lawn furniture at the lawns plus .
why are all cars black or gray now ?
it &apos;s like if you see a red one , it &apos;s a big deal .
i &apos;m thinking about wearing a watch again .
