what ?
no hustle , no muscle !
gym class in the &apos; 80s --
the shorts were super @-@ short , the exercises dumb ,
and the games were barbaric .
i know you &apos;re aiming for down there , ryan ,
but it &apos;s not cool !
teams weren &apos;t assigned ,
but handpicked with brutal honesty
and no consideration of a fragile adolescent &apos;s feelings .
oh , god . this is not gonna be easy .
i &apos;m gonna have to go with small wonder over there .
you &apos;re going down , &quot; goldnerd . &quot;
sorry .
after years of thinking i had suffered through
every indignity gym class had to offer ,
turns out the worst was yet to come .
the presidential fitness test --
our great president , ronald reagan ,
along with the predator himself ,
arnold schwarzenegger ,
care enough about you to demand physical excellence .
technically , arnold wasn &apos;t the predator .
he was the prey .
nobody cares , goldfarb .
it &apos;s goldberg .
it &apos;s literally written on my shirt .
good for you . now , why is this test important ?
america needs warriors to fight the evils of communism .
tomorrow , that battle begins with the seven basic exercises ,
which include the sit @-@ and @-@ reach , the mile run ,
and the pull @-@ up .
what if you can &apos;t do a pull @-@ up ?
i &apos;m asking hypothetically for a friend
that couldn &apos;t make it today .
name &apos;s josh . you don &apos;t know him .
well , if you are the kind of boy who is weak of will and spirit ,
you don &apos;t have to do it .
instead , you will join the girls in the flexed arm hang .
josh is not gonna like that .
the news was bleak .
i was definitely screwed .
i mean , josh was screwed .
honey , it &apos;s so late .
why are you sitting alone in the dark ?
oh , no . what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing .
poopie , something &apos;s wrong .
there &apos;s a storm inside you ,
and i &apos;m not leaving till i see a little sunshine .
why do you always say super @-@ weird stuff like that ?
looks like someone needs a sugar shower .
all right . all right !
stop ! stop !
if you must know ,
the presidential fitness test is tomorrow ,
and i &apos;m gonna be the only guy doing the flexed arm hang
with the girls .
say no more .
mama will never , ever let anything
remotely uncomfortable happen to you .
i &apos;ll just write you a note and get you out of it .
for real ?
absolutely .
absolutely not .
every kid in america has to take that test .
well , w @-@ what does that have to do with my adam ?
it &apos;s a rite of passage .
you can &apos;t get out of a rite of passage
with a note from your mom .
fine ! we get it . i won &apos;t write a note .
i &apos;ll write you a note .
seriously ?
i &apos;m gonna hug you so hard right now ,
i might break every bone in your body .
come on , adam .
don &apos;t be scared . you can hug me harder than that .
okay . how does this feel ?
mama will write you a note .
it was april 8 , 1980 @-@ something .
before e @-@ mail and facetime ,
the way to keep in touch with somebody
was by sending them an actual piece of paper
with writing on it !
are you kidding me ? where are your pants ?
my pen pal will be here any minute .
doesn &apos;t having a pen pal come to your house
defeat the whole purpose of having a pen pal ?
fanny &apos;s just gonna be here for a few days .
you can suffer through by wearing bottoms .
and for the love of all that is holy ,
be nice to the girl .
why wouldn &apos;t i be nice to her ? !
we speak the same language .
mom , if he doesn &apos;t not wear his pants
and stop speaking french gibberish ,
i will leave this house forever .
come on , ambassador .
let &apos;s get you some pants .
that means nothing !
what is this ?
why do you look like a bigger knob than usual ?
&apos;cause i saw that pic of your sexually charged french friend ,
asnd i am not letting this amazing opportunity go to waste .
oh , no .
just because she &apos;s french
doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;ll make out with you .
i beg to differ , actually .
in my experience ,
the french demoiselle is very adventurous .
what &apos;s her name again ?
fanny .
oh , that &apos;s a lay @-@ up .
score !
pops !
what ? she &apos;s named after a butt .
that &apos;s a green light if i ever saw one .
erica , i &apos;m gonna need your help .
here &apos;s a bunch of phrases i need translated into her native tongue
so i can get a little of that native tongue .
&quot; girl , our countries have been at war too long .
let &apos;s make peace and love together . &quot;
you know what ? i will help you .
nice .
i can tell by that smile we &apos;re on the same page .
you &apos;re gonna mess with him , aren &apos;t you ?
big time .
i don &apos;t know how he doesn &apos;t see
that kind of thing coming by now .
it &apos;s very upsetting .
while erica was scheming against barry ,
my mom &apos;s scheme to get me out of gym class was in motion .
you have osgood- &quot; shladder &quot; disease ?
actually , it &apos;s pronounced &quot; schlotter , &quot;
and there &apos;s an article attached .
my hamstrings and ligaments aren &apos;t keeping up with my bones .
i &apos;m growing too fast .
you &apos;re growing too fast ? where ?
i @-@ it &apos;s all in the note .
you really expect me to believe
your mother wrote this note ?
yes , &apos; cause she actually did .
son , did you ever see the movie &quot; red dawn &quot; ?
a million times .
do you love movies ? &apos; cause i love movies .
let me ask you a question .
what are you gonna do when the russki invaders
storm the suburbs of philly ?
actually , i think they &apos;d be more interested
in coastal cities and financial centers .
you &apos;re gonna have to fight
and use the skills you learned right here !
even the pull @-@ up ?
especially the pull @-@ up .
you &apos;ll need your upper @-@ arm strength to bash skulls .
i don &apos;t want to ... bash skulls .
the kids in &quot; red dawn &quot; didn &apos;t want to , either ,
but they had to in order to survive .
so ... where are we with that note ?
i just received an authentic , bona fide note
from mr . goldfarb here
saying that he is physically unable
to complete the presidential fitness test .
so , i &apos;ve decided to push the test one week
until he gets better .
until then , we &apos;ll be running laps .
mr. goldfarb will stand here and watch .
feel free to wish him a speedy recovery in your own way .
all right ! let &apos;s go !
hoof it ! knees high !
you &apos;re so dead , goldnerd .
totally get it .
oh , real nice , lisa . real nice .
meanwhile , erica &apos;s pen pal , fanny , had arrived
and was getting the grand tour of the goldberg home .
fantastique .
&apos;sup , fanny ?
mi casa es su casa .
hunk of your native bread ?
oh . barree . bonjour .
hi .
oh , here .
use these cards i translated for you .
start with this one . it says , &quot; welcome to our home .
it &apos;s really nice to have you here . &quot;
good stuff . great start .
um , i know you want to do this next one .
it &apos;s &quot; how you doing , girl ? &quot;
she likes it .
yeah , it &apos;s working . don &apos;t stop now .
okay ...
it sounded like i said &quot; gary coleman . &quot;
weird .
beautiful language .
good night . or should i say ...
let me tell you something , mr. and mrs . goldfarb .
there are three things i hate in life --
my ex @-@ wife , carrots , and lies .
okay , why did i close my store and rush down here ?
because president reagan asked me personally
through a xeroxed letter to oversee a fitness test
of his design .
and your son tried to get of it
with an absurd note ...
that no parent would ever write .
i wrote the note .
oh me .
it was a ridiculous test , murray .
since when is strength measured
by how many pull @-@ ups a person can do ?
you know what takes real strength ?
tackling the role of levi
in &quot; joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat . &quot;
and adam was scrumptious .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with my test , ma &apos;am .
if adam suffers from anything ,
it is from a far more serious
and permanent condition called the wuss @-@ bags .
my son may be unathletic and afraid of birds --
he &apos;s not afraid of all birds .
i know , not all birds .
not all birds .
but he &apos;s not a wuss .
look , i am administering a test at the direct order
of the president of the united states .
if you want adam out of it , get a note from him .
then it &apos;s settled .
i &apos;ll see you back here on monday .
what just happened ?
she &apos;s gonna go get a note from the president .
look out , mr . reagan .
beverly goldberg &apos;s coming for you .
my mom &apos;s mission to track down the president had begun .
first stop -- harrisburg , the state capital .
hello . i &apos;m pennsylvania citizen beverly goldberg ,
and i &apos;m here to speak to the governor .
this is the comptroller &apos;s office .
great . then i &apos;ll speak to the comptroller .
a @-@ a @-@ and what does this pertain to ?
the presidential fitness test .
and the comptroller can help how ?
he can put me in touch with the governor ,
who can put me in touch with the president
so i can get my son out of gym class .
question -- do you have any idea what a @-@ a comptroller does ?
of course .
he comptrols the great state of pennsylvania ,
and i need him to get me to the man who comptrols america .
here &apos;s a thing -- uh , &quot; comptrol , &quot;
the way you &apos;re using it , isn &apos;t a word .
yes , it is .
no . no , it &apos;s not .
it is .
not really .
yeah , it is . - definitely not a word --
straight @-@ up not a word .
uh , but i get the sense you &apos;re not gonna leave ,
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
there &apos;s a guy in the state assembly &apos;s office
who screwed over my sister .
i think he should meet you .
sound good ?
sounds great .
now , i &apos;m just gonna write down these directions ,
and when you see him , just tell him ,
&quot; jill &apos;s brother says hi . &quot;
thank you for taking comptrol of the situation .
not a word .
yes , it is .
meanwhile , my brother was working on
his french connection .
good morning , mon cherie .
hello , barree .
getting into this right away , huh , barry ?
what ? i &apos;m just showing her a traditional american breakfast .
fanny , this is called a pop @-@ tart .
in america , we eat our fruit inside bread --
for you .
merci .
you know what else goes down easy in the morning ?
rap music .
erica , you translated my masterpiece , right ?
every word .
it &apos;s called &quot; mon lit . &quot;
it means &quot; my bed . &quot;
enough . i &apos;m sorry . i have to stop this .
it &apos;s too far .
you speak french ?
how many times do i have to tell you this ?
i was in the war . i helped liberate france .
that was real ?
i &apos;m confused . what &apos;s happening ?
the song -- it &apos;s about peeing in your bed .
that wasn &apos;t your intention , right ?
no ! no .
it had the word &quot; pee @-@ pee &quot; in it , like , a lot .
what the hell , erica ?
i asked you for your help , and you made a fool of me ?
i told you not to hit on my friend .
i mean , did you actually think you had a chance with her ?
i don &apos;t know !
i mean , the girls here don &apos;t get me at all ,
so i thought someone from another country might .
now you ruined that , too .
while barry had lost faith in romance ,
i still had faith in my mom .
has mom come back from the president &apos;s house yet ?
are you kidding ? no .
have you checked the answering machine ?
maybe mr . reagan left a message or something .
you know , the president &apos;s a very busy man .
he might not have time to help one little boy
get out of gym class .
he likes jelly beans .
no , no , h @-@ he &apos;s got a fun side ,
but i think you might want to consider
that your mom &apos;s not gonna come through on this .
i know it &apos;s a bit of a long shot ,
but she &apos;s never let me down before .
and then something happened more surprising
than my mom getting a note from the president .
come here , buddy . i want to talk to you .
my dad decided to open up to me .
you know why i ... really want you to take this test ?
you need an outlet for your hostility ?
no ! stop aggravating me !
i &apos;m trying to help you here , man .
okay , i &apos;m gonna tell you something
your brother and sister don &apos;t know .
i played a lot of sports in high school ,
but there was one thing i could never do -- swim .
what ?
yeah .
i grew up in the city . where would i learn ?
well , you could take the bus to the beach ,
or there &apos;s summer camps .
the ymca has a very nice program .
how about i talk , you listen ?
i tried everything in my power
to get out of that swim class
&apos;cause i knew if i got in the pool ,
i &apos;d humiliate myself in front of everybody .
so , what did you do ?
i got in that damn pool !
at first , i was embarrassed ,
but by the end of the semester ,
i @-@ i developed quite a mean backstroke .
really ?
yeah !
you don &apos;t have to be the best .
you just got to try .
well , since you were an athlete back in the day ,
maybe you could help me with my pull @-@ ups .
let &apos;s get to work . come on !
let &apos;s do this .
i did it .
i got a note from the president
of the united states of america .
actually , it &apos;s from the secretary
to the undersecretary to the president ,
who &apos;s the best friend of the lieutenant governor &apos;s cousin
who just wanted to get me out of the office ,
but it &apos;s got the presidential seal ,
so it &apos;s official .
wow . but no .
adam and i just had a talk ,
and he understands the importance of just trying .
i &apos;ll take the note ! i &apos;ll take the note .
mom , you &apos;re the best .
i &apos;ll see you around the tv sometime .
and , just like that ,
i had a presidential pardon from fitness .
fanny just left for the airport .
you didn &apos;t want to say goodbye ?
what &apos;s the point ?
she thinks i &apos;m a bed @-@ wetting loser thanks to you .
actually , i don &apos;t think she does .
look , she left you this note .
oh , no ! i don &apos;t read french !
right . but i do .
&quot; barry , sorry i was so weird around you .
american boys intimidate me ,
especially the ones who are so good at sports ,
nunchucking , and frisbee . &quot;
she knows about my frisbee skills ?
did she write about the sketch i gave her
of us riding a dolphin ?
no .
but she did say if you &apos;re ever in paris , look her up .
does it really say that ?
yes .
it does . i @-@ it really does .
looks like she was into you , kiddo .
i &apos;m not surprised . i &apos;m irresistible .
this is a thank @-@ you note to your parents .
well , i felt sorry for the big dope .
no , you care about him .
maybe a little .
well , it was a nice thing to do .
it was , but unfortunately , it led to this .
i &apos;ve got to stop that plane !
i &apos;m coming , fanny !
i &apos;m coming for you !
thanks to my mom , i was free .
and even so , i could hear my dad &apos;s voice
ringing in my head .
adam , i really think you should take this test .
turns out it actually was my dad .
dad , what are you doing here ?
i came here to tell you something .
i can &apos;t swim .
but you said you --
i know what i said ... but i lied .
i cut that class , and i @-@ i never learned how .
it &apos;s the biggest regret of my life ,
and i don &apos;t want you growing up
having the same regrets i do .
goldfarb , get your ass in here !
i may never be able to swim ,
but i know you can do one pull @-@ up .
all right , goldfarb . ready for the flexed arm hang ?
no . today , i &apos;m doing pull @-@ ups .
you can &apos;t park there .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m here to see a girl . i &apos;m in love .
you got it , chief . that &apos;s how the world works .
we need a tow truck at terminal 3 .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay .
i just have a pocket knife .
all right , go ahead . you &apos;re good .
let &apos;s go , goldfarb . the president is waiting .
attaboy !
yes ! whoo !
yeah !
my lord ,
that was the ugliest pull @-@ up i &apos;ve ever seen .
you &apos;ll still get killed in the first wave of attacks ,
but maybe , just maybe ,
you &apos;ll take a couple of those
commie bastards with you .
well done , goldberg .
last call for flight 612 to paris , france .
wait -- hold the plane !
fanny !
fanny .
stop telling me you love me .
it &apos;s not meant to be .
i have to stay here
and become an american sports and music icon .
but we &apos;ll always have pop @-@ tarts , fanny .
we &apos;ll always have pop @-@ tarts .
she kissed me .
twice .
two french kisses .
okay , that &apos;s enough . no more . i like his little baby arms .
i &apos;m gonna chew on those arms !
oh ! tickle , tickle !
will you stop it ? what do you do that for ?
i love him so much .
okay , i tackled my fear .
now it &apos;s your turn .
kick . kick . use your legs .
i &apos;m kicking .
see , you &apos;re doing it .
i &apos;m doing it !
keep on going .
all right .
come on , give it all you got .
come on . a little bit .
yes !
has anyone seen my car ?
i know the sign says you can &apos;t park there ,
but it &apos;s okay &apos; cause i &apos;m in love .
hasta la vista , baby .
