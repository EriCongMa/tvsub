bijan for men ?
bijan for men !
and this is funny clown .
it &apos;s only for after his naps , not before , or he won &apos;t sleep .
we &apos;ve been through this before . we have a good time .

honey , relax . ross is great with him .
don &apos;t look so surprised . i &apos;m a lovely person .

&quot; my mommies love me . &quot;

oh , hi , jul ....
hi , jew !
okay , sure .
that &apos;d be great . see you then . bye .
did you just say , &quot; hi , jew &quot; ?
yes , i did .
that was my friend eddie moskowitz .
he &apos;s going through this whole religious thing .
yeah , he likes it . reaffirms his faith .
ben , dinner !
thanks , aunt pheebs .
did you microwave that ? you can &apos;t do that to breast milk .
i think i know how to heat breast milk .
what did you just do ?
i licked my arm , what ?
it &apos;s breast milk !
so ?
phoebe , that is juice squeezed from a person .
what is the big deal ?
what did you just do ?
can people stop drinking the breast milk ?
you won &apos;t even taste it ?
not even if you just pretend it &apos;s milk ?
not even if carol &apos;s breast had a picture of a missing child on it .
where is everybody ?
at the park . where have you been ?
just out .
had some lunch . just me . a little quality time with me .
thanks for your jacket .
no problem .
you can borrow it , by the way .
here are your keys , honey .
if you were at lunch alone , how come it cost you $ 53 ?
you know what probably happened ?
someone stole my credit card .
and put the receipt back in your pocket ?
that is an excellent , excellent question .
that is excellent .
what &apos;s with you ? who did you have lunch with ?
judy .
who ?
julie .
what ?
jody .
you were with julie ?
when it started , i was just trying to be nice to her ...
... because she was my brother &apos;s girlfriend .
and then one thing led to another ...
... and before i knew it , we were ...
... shopping .
oh , my god !
wait , we only did it once .
it meant nothing to me !
really , i was thinking of you the whole time .
look , i &apos;m sorry , all right ? i never meant for you to find out .
oh , please ! please ! you wanted to get caught !
that is not true !
so you just happened to leave it in here ?
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid ?
okay , i just have to know one thing .
did you go to bloomingdale &apos;s ?
okay , i just really need to not be with you right now .
hi , who &apos;s this ?
hi , joanne . is rachel working ? it &apos;s monica .
yes , i know i did a horrible thing .
joanne , it &apos;s not as simple as all that .
no , i don &apos;t care what steve thinks . hi , steve .
how did we do ?
i tasted ben &apos;s milk and ross freaked out .
i did not freak out .
why &apos;d you freak out ?
because it &apos;s breast milk .
it &apos;s gross !
my breast milk is gross ?
this should be fun .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
i just don &apos;t think breast milk is for adults .
of course , the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids .
don &apos;t be silly . i &apos;ve tried it . it &apos;s no big deal .
just taste it .
that would be no .
come on .
try it .
it &apos;s natural .
it doesn &apos;t taste bad .
yeah , it tastes kind of sweet . sort of like ....
like what ?
cantaloupe juice .
exactly .
you &apos;ve tasted it .
you &apos;ve tasted it .
oh , you &apos;ve tasted it .
you can keep saying it , but it won &apos;t stop being true .
give me the bottle .
get me the towel .
howdy .
give me a box of juice .
well , they switched me over to hombre .
maybe it &apos;s because of the way you &apos;re dressed .
or this guy &apos;s doing so good they want to put more people on it .
this guy goes through two bottles a day now .
what do you care ?
you &apos;re an actor . this is your day job . it &apos;s nothing !
i know , but i was the best .
you know ? i liked being the best .
maybe i should get out of the game .
they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .
say you do that .
sooner or later , somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar .
then where you gonna run ?
you &apos;re right .
i say you show him what you &apos;re made of . stand your ground .
show him that you &apos;re the baddest hombre west of the lingerie !
i &apos;m gonna do it !
all right !
now , go see miss kitty and she &apos;ll fix you up with a nice hooker .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
that &apos;s good because i &apos;m not listening .
i feel terrible . i really do .
i &apos;m sorry . did my back hurt your knife ?
say that i &apos;m friends with her . is that so terrible ?
it &apos;s that terrible ?
you don &apos;t get it !
it &apos;s bad enough she stole the guy ...
... who may be the person l &apos;m supposed to be with .
but now ...
... she &apos;s actually ....
but now she &apos;s actually stealing you !
what are you talking about ?
nobody could steal me from you .
because i &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .
you &apos;re my ....
and we &apos;re ....
oh , i love you !
i love you too !
you guys , i know that this really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with me .
but i love you guys too !
i really needed that .
i know that right now ...
... you really need to hate julie &apos;s guts .
but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
she &apos;s just a girl who met a guy , and now they go out .
i think that if you gave her a chance , you &apos;d like her .
will you give it a chance ?
for me ?
i &apos;d do anything for you , you know that .
i &apos;d do anything for you !
wait , wait , wait !
mornin &apos; .
i said , mornin &apos; !
i heard you .
all right , everybody . i &apos;m opening the doors .
you boys ready ?
ready .
yeah , l &apos;m ready .
you idiot ! you stupid cowboy !
you &apos;ve blinded me ! i &apos;m suing !
oh , my god ! todd ! what the hell did you do ?
sorry . i &apos;m such a doofus !
i &apos;m so sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
my god , what happened ?
these new kids , they never last .
sooner or later they all ...
... stop lasting .
what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now ?
sure .
i just thought we should hang out .
i mean , you know , we &apos;ve never really talked .
i guess you &apos;d know that , being one of the two of us .
i know .
i probably shouldn &apos;t even tell you this ...
... but l &apos;m pretty much totally intimidated by you .
really ?
me ?
oh , my god , are you kidding ?
ross is so crazy about you ...
... and i really wanted you to like me , and l ....
it &apos;s probably me just being totally paranoid ...
... but i kind of got the feeling that maybe you don &apos;t .
well , you &apos;re not totally paranoid .
when you and ross first started going out ...
... it was really hard for me ...
... for many reasons of which l &apos;m not gonna bore you with now .
i see how happy he is and how good you guys are together .
and monica &apos;s always saying how nice you are ...
... and god , i hate it when she &apos;s right !
thanks .
would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?
yeah , that &apos;d be great . i &apos;d love it .
i &apos;d love it too .
shoot , i gotta go .
so i &apos;ll talk to you later .
all right , julie .
what a manipulative bitch .
