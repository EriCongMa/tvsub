which is funny , because in high school i failed biology ...
... and tonight biology failed me .
check it out . i could play this while the guests are coming in . okay .
twelve years old and addicted to pork
no one thought monica would marry
she knew her way around a knife and a fork
phoebe , that &apos;s great , but ...
so you &apos;re not convinced . that &apos;s all right because i got another one .
first time i met chandler i thought he was gay
but here i am singing on his wedding day
phoebe , no .
if you &apos;d let me finish , it goes on to say that he &apos;s probably not gay .
you guys don &apos;t have this problem , you &apos;re made of wood .
hey , you look great .
thanks .
you okay over there ?
i don &apos;t know . you know ? i feel a little ...
you know what ? never mind . i &apos;ll be fine .

happy monica &apos;s night .
well , thank you . you too .
can you believe they are actually getting married ?

oh , no , no , no .
&quot; we , &quot; you with someone , me with someone .
good , you scared me a minute .
i know . shake it off .
it &apos;s just because you and i , we were like a nightmare .
no , but there were some good times .
absolutely . like , there was ...
surely you can think of something .
just give me a minute .
oh , well , yes .
i can think of one good thing .
you were always good at the ...
... stuff .
i was good at the stuff ?
i really liked your hands .
my hands ?
way to go , guys .
you were really good at the stuff too .
oh , i know .
what are you thinking about ?
just some stuff .
hey , you know what we never did ?
oh , no , not that .
we never had a bonus night .
a what ?
you know , a bonus night .
two people break up , but they get back together for one night .
one night , just sex ? no strings attached ?
yeah , yeah , we never had that .
no .
okay , this is getting a little crazy .
i &apos;m sure it would be amazing ...
... but i really don &apos;t think it would be a good idea .
i really ...
... really ...
... don &apos;t .
well , at least i can still do some things .
&apos;sup ?
&apos;sup , dude ?
take whatever you want , just don &apos;t hurt me .
you playing a little playstation , huh ?
that &apos;s whack .
playstation is whack .
&apos;sup with the whack playstation , &apos; sup ?
come on , am i 19 or what ?
yes , on a scale of one to ten , ten being the dumbest a person can look ...
... you are definitely 19 .
come on , really . how old ?
young . you &apos;re a man @-@ child , okay ?
now get changed , everybody &apos;s ready . and please , please , keep my underwear .
thanks .
you &apos;ve had a lot of sex , right ?
when , today ?
some , not a lot .
the reason i &apos;m asking is because i had kind of a ...
i was unable to ...
i really wanted to , but i couldn &apos;t ...
i cannot believe i &apos;m asking advice from somebody who &apos;s wearing that hat .
i had an incident .
don &apos;t worry about that , man . that happens .
it &apos;s happened to you ?
yeah , once .
well , what &apos;d you do ?
i did it anyway .
phoebe , come on , let &apos;s go .
come on .
why aren &apos;t you dressed yet ?
i wrote the best song for your wedding .
check this out .
if you get ready now , you can play .
really ? !
yes .
that &apos;s so exciting ! thanks , mon .
but if you touch my guitar again , i &apos;ll have to pound on you a little bit .
fair enough . get ready . i &apos;ll get everybody .
finally we can start celebrating my ...
i &apos;m sorry , apparently i opened the door to the past .
okay , monica , mon . okay , what you just saw ...
can i ask you just a little question ? why tonight ?
i waited my whole life to be engaged ...
... and unlike some , i only plan on doing this once .
maybe it &apos;s selfish , i &apos;m sorry . but i hoped tonight could just be about that .
but it is just about that .
now it &apos;s about you getting back together .
see , you kind of stole my thunder .
we did not steal your thunder.we are not getting back together .
yeah , no , and you know what ? nobody even saw .
that &apos;s true .
we just kissed .
it was just a kiss .
you guys kissed ? !
what does this mean ? !
are you back together ? can i sing at your wedding ?
thunder being stolen .
phoebe , it &apos;s nothing .
let &apos;s not make a big deal of this .
it was a one @-@ time thing . it doesn &apos;t even matter .
oh , my god .
i cannot believe you guys are talking about this .
problems in the bedroom are between a man and a woman .
all right ? now , chandler is doing the best he can .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what they were talking about .
no , but let &apos;s talk about it .
what a great night . chandler can &apos;t do it , they kissed .
what ?
you guys kissed ? this is huge .
no , it &apos;s not huge .
people thinking it &apos;s huge has led monica to believe ...
... we &apos;re stealing her thunder , which we aren &apos;t .
we &apos;re still talking about it .
that and chandler &apos;s problem .
monica , listen , listen .
would you feel better if we stopped talking about ross and rachel ?
that would be lovely .
you got it .
now , i can pass for 19 , right ?
yes , you can pass for 19 .
really ?
yes .
seriously ?
seriously ?
seriously , no . okay ? you can play your own age , which is 31 .
i &apos;m 30 !
joey , you are not . you &apos;re 31 .
oh , crap !
so the plaza . we &apos;ll get some mai tais ? maybe no more for you though .
you know , i think i don &apos;t feel like going to the plaza .
monica , this is ridiculous .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it . i don &apos;t . especially with you .
that is whack .
i &apos;ll play it at the wedding .
we &apos;ll see if they actually let you play .
they tell you anything you want to hear ...
... like , &quot; you look 19 . &quot;
then they just take it away , like , &quot; no , you don &apos;t . &quot;
monica won &apos;t take this away .
wouldrt she ?
would she ?
would she ?
would she ?
would she ?
it &apos;s starting to sound like &quot; wood cheese . &quot;
man , i could go for some wood cheese right now .
guess who .
hey , i just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air .
what did monica mean :
&quot; i don &apos;t want to talk , &quot; especially with me ?
why not especially you and me ? we were both kissing .
still thinking about it ?
i &apos;m serious . what did she mean by that ? &quot; especially you . &quot;
who cares ?
i care .
and so do i.
i have to talk to her . will you let me get changed ?
am i going to let you watch me ?
no .
i can &apos;t believe her . it &apos;s just so typical .
i know you &apos;re upset , but don &apos;t forget there is going to be a wedding .
you are going to throw the bouquet , and then a honeymoon .
maybe in paris .
paris ?
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la blah @-@ blah @-@ blah .
keep talking .
we will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love ...
... not just because it &apos;s romantic , but because i can .
i love you .
bonjour monsieur
don &apos;t say anything , you might scare it away .
it &apos;s paris . who knows we &apos;re here ?
hi , pheebs . what &apos;s up ?
you said i could sing at your wedding , so i need a small deposit .
you know , some good @-@ faith money to hold the date .
we &apos;re not giving you a deposit for our wedding .
oh , i see .
they break your heart , don &apos;t they ?
you know , i don &apos;t really need their permission .
you want to sing at their wedding , sing at their wedding .
yeah , and if you want to look 19 , then you ...
you got to do something about your eyes .
what &apos;s wrong with my eyes ?
they give you away . there &apos;s too much wisdom in there .
put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes .
that &apos;ll get rid of my wisdom ? - maybe 10 minutes for you .
give her the deposit , give her the ring . i don &apos;t care .
what did you mean when you said ...
... you didn &apos;t want to talk to anyone , especially me ?
what a great apology . and you accept . bye @-@ bye .
no , seriously , what was the &quot; especially me &quot; part about ?
let &apos;s just say it &apos;s not the first time you &apos;ve stolen my thunder .
hey , here &apos;s a thought ...
monica , what are you talking about ?
my sweet 16 . you went to third base with my cousin charlie .
third base .
it was all everybody could talk about .
the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring .
we had a caricaturist .
whenever i get married guess who won &apos;t be asked to sing
somebody named geller and somebody else named bing
monica , your sweet 16 was like a million years ago .
yet here you are doing it again .
i don &apos;t want to steal your stupid thunder .
why else would you have made out with ross ?
got me .
easy , mimey , the moment has passed . it aren &apos;t gonna happen .
it &apos;d be nice if i could have this night .
i never wanted any part of your night .
no one was supposed to see us .
is that why you did it in the secret hallway , where nobody ever goes ?
rachel , i &apos;ve been thinking .
i don &apos;t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea .
i &apos;m calling it off .
way to save your dignity , my man .
mon , why , why would i ever want to take away from your night ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe you feel a little resentful .
maybe you thought you &apos;d get married first .
maybe you can &apos;t stand ...
... that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you .
oh , wow , that ... you know what ? that is so unfair .
now i want to steal your thunder .
come on , ross . let &apos;s go have sex !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re gonna have sex on my engagement night .
well , somebody should .
look , if we &apos;re gonna do this ...
we &apos;re not . she &apos;s just gonna think we are .
i see , so everybody wins .
who is it ?
it &apos;s monica , open up .
okay , ross , stop it . please , wait a minute .
yeah , you like that , baby ?
may we help you ?
i wanted to say i hope you have sex , and i hope you get back together .
i warn you , the night you announce your engagement ...
... l &apos;m going to announce that i &apos;m pregnant .
how is that ever going to happen ?
do you want to know why i was with ross tonight ?
i know why .
you don &apos;t .
okay , why ?
because i was sad .
what do you mean ?
look , i am so ...
... so happy for you guys .
but you getting married reminds me of the fact that i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not even close .
maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better .
i know that that &apos;s dumb , but you were so depressed ...
... when ross got married , you slept with chandler .
i don &apos;t care , she slept with me .
anyway , sweetie , i am so sorry i ruined your night .
i &apos;m sorry i almost made you sleep with ross .
i &apos;m gonna take off .
congratulations , man .
thanks .
and rachel ...
... what can i say ?
you missed your chance .
from now on , the only person who &apos;s gona enjoy these bad boys is me .
we thought phoebe would leave
but she just stayed and stayed
that &apos;s right , i &apos;m here all night
and chandler will never get ...
hey , here &apos;s a dollar .
consider it a deposit . please sing at our wedding .
thank you .
now who will perform the ceremony
who will perform the cer ...
i &apos;ll pound on him in the morning .
