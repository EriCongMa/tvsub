That ain't your grandpappy's motor.
That a 454 C.I.F.E. Stroker?
Sure is, Flaco.
Take a guess how many extra horses in there.
I don't know. Like, a hundred?
Try 250!
250?
Love to turn that supercharged mod on.
Yeah, those are new.
It's about to get hot in here.
That is so cool.
Hey, make sure his old lady won't miss that cash,
'cause he's gonna lose it.
Worry about your own old lady.
Last call for bets on Veloz and Rayo.
Rayo?
Who's he?
He's turbocharged, man.
Check that out, man.
That's Rayo.
He's fast, brother.
I've worked on that 'Stang. It's not gonna beat my Camaro.
You're gonna kill him, homes.
Yo. Take a good look at the ass-end of my car.
That's all you'll be seeing tonight, cabron.
Yeah? Well you'll be kissing mine after I beat you.
That's funny.
Yeah, kiss his ass, cabron! Oh!
That's the plan.
It's bottle time.
You really should have a total cholesterol test.
I should have a lot of things.
I should have six months in my rainy-day fund.
I should have eight hours of sleep.
I should also have a best friend who doesn't nag me.
Okay, you just can't admit
that this is about your coffee addiction.
Okay, so, go a day without.
Okay. Not today.
Let's go, Jimmie.
Don't push, man.
There's something I do not miss -- drug arrests.
But Frankie does make those street clothes
look quite good.
Yo, this is an illegal arrest.
Really?
Man, you know it. This is illegal.
This is not -- - So, the 15 bags of crystal meth
I found in your pocket weren't yours?
Well, maybe he was wearing someone else's pants.
Uh, yeah. You heard the lady.
That's it.
Come on, pal.
Let's go. - Hey, listen -- I was not dealing, okay?
I might have been giving away free samples,
but tell this clown right here
that you can't bust me for that.
Do that for me, baby?
Okay, don't call me "baby."
And that clown is my brother. Let's go.
What are you doing talking to my prisoner?
Well, if you don't want me talking to your prisoner,
you should be here to help.
Detective Rizzoli was moving him by himself.
I'm on it. Other rizzoli, get him upstairs.
What is your problem?
I don't have a problem.
Why is he being such a douche?
He should be down here moving his own prisoner.
The French claim "douche" originated with them,
but it's really an Italian word -- "doccia."
It's an ancient means of conveying water.
I'm using it to convey contempt.
What are you doing?
Checking your body temperature.
Well, stop.
All right.
Why are you doing it?
Subtle signs of sexual arousal include a rise in temperature.
I am not aroused by Martinez.
Well, it is nothing to be ashamed of.
Most women experience a sexual rush around bad boys.
Put out your hand.
Give me my coffee.
Mm-hmm. Tremors.
You know it's too much caffeine, Maura.
It's from him.
And I think he's sexy.
Well, he thinks he's sexy, too.
They're at it again.
Who?
These idiot drag racers.
We got a dead one. Come on.
I mean, I would like to get along with him.
I don't know why he's got to make it so hard.
Okay, Martinez is an alpha male.
You're an alpha female. You make him uncomfortable.
So, it's my fault?
What do we have?
Looks like an illegal street race.
Emphasis on "illegal" -- no witnesses.
Spectators scattered when the car caught on fire.
Even the hard-core video-heads aren't posting.
Looks like he's still driving.
He's got third-degree burns, likely from a flash fire.
We got a name?
No. No plates on the car, either.
You run the vin number?
It was removed.
We might be able to get a number off the engine.
Doubt it -- street racers file the numbers off,
and they use parts from different cars.
Whatever caught fire started inside the car.
Maybe nitrous?
Yeah.
I've read about that.
Street racers use nitrous-oxide systems
to boost horsepower and torque.
Makes the car real fast.
And you know that because...?
I might have added one to my mom's station wagon.
Oh, my god. What happened?
Blew the engine. She grounded me for six months.
I called in the bomb squad just to be on the safe side.
All right, well, let's start looking around
for pieces of aluminum shrapnel, maybe from a nitrous tank.
Jane! Hey.
What did I tell you, bro?
Jane! What are you guys doing here?
Oh, well, they make us show up when there's a dead guy.
What are you doing here?
Ah, just passing by,
you know, moving through.
So you missed the race?
What race? Hey. Can I get a quick shot of you
for, uh, Candidgram?
It's this cool thing I'm doing.
I'm documenting every second --
My whole life, I mean -- with video selfies.
Your whole life? Every second?
Did you get any, uh, video selfies this morning?
Oh, yeah, yeah. So rad. Even got the explosion.
So, you weat the race.
Yeah. Poor Veloz.
You know his full name?
Ah, h-he's a one-namer, like Madonna.
Hey, you know "Veloz" means "super fast"?
Yeah.
I had this, uh --
this hot Latina girlfriend, Diana.
She was pretty Veloz. You know what I mean?
Okay, Giovanni. Give me your phone.
Why?
Because you recorded the race.
How do you know that?
Hand it over.
No.
No? How's the Alfa?
Sweet.
I'm gonna put a turbo on it, try to take on these V-8s.
Yeah? You want to call me before?
Maybe I'll come watch you race.
Yeah, I will.
No. Wait. Street racing is illegal.
I'll have to seize your car.
Wait. What?
Yeah. Unless...
Unless what?
Unless we can find something in the footage on your phone.
Okay.
Just -- just don't delete anything.
A-and ignore me and my bros in the jacuzzi
with the Irish...setter.
Oh, my god.
Frost, I think Giovanni recorded the race.
Could you look on his phone?
That's great, Jane.
Might have found a piece of the tank.
See how it curves in there?
That means the explosive was attached
to the outside of the tank, right?
May I?
It's not nitrous oxide.
It's propane.
Well, if it's propane, it's murder.
Well, I'll need to confirm, of course.
Yeah, that's what it smells like.
Sorry, B.T. Sarron -- lead investigator.
"B.T."?
As in "Brandon Thomas..."
Though everyone seems to think it's for "bomb tech."
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he had a nitrous-oxide tank,
and it was filled with propane.
Well, that doesn't seem like a mistake
a savvy drag racer would make.
Got something.
It's part of a blasting cap.
So it wasn't a mistake.
Somebody rigged this car to explode.
Ooh. Nice oven mitts.
Thank you. They cheer me up.
205 degrees Celsius.
Somebody overcooked the Thanksgiving turkey.
Nothing too exciting over there.
Eh, I'll eventually get all the shrapnel.
It's concentrated in the posterior regions
of the shoulder, neck, and head, but he's still too hot.
Speaking of too hot, where's B.T.?
B.T. who?
Funny.
Actually, since your last boyfriend
was Dennis the serial killer, I'm all for B.T.
Do you think there are any fingers left in these gloves?
Like, I would love some prints.
What, we got another body coming in?
In a manner of speaking.
We're doing the vehicle autopsy here.
Wh-- in the morgue?
In here? You can't do that.
Well, of course I can. It's part of my office.
And B.T. Wants to be in close proximity to the crime lab
in order to facilitate his examination of the car.
Or his examination of the medical examiner.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come here.
Wh-what are you doing?
I'm taking your temperature.
It's a subtle sign of sexual arousal.
He's a very nice man.
He has a PhD in applied physics, and he practices yoga.
And why would you like that, a yogi with a PhD?
He's so hideous to look at, too.
I said he was nice.
Okay.
Can you find some fingers in there, please,
'cause I really need an I.D.?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
The test of true love -- will he be disgusted
when he finds you wearing the dead man's fingertips?
Hmm. I don't know. Let's find out.
Hello.
Hey.
So, uh, the Camaro's ready to be autopsied?
I hope it's not an inconvenience.
You know, it just seemed easier to do it
closer to the crime lab.
Are you wearing his fingers?
That's remarkable.
I-I've heard of this technique,
but I never thought I'd get to see it in action.
Oh, yes, well, there's always action
here in the crime lab.
How did you do it?
Well, I immersed his fingers in a rehydration solution.
Sodium carbonate?
Yes.
10 grams?
Yes, with ethanol.
95% pure?
Along with distilled water.
Okay, and for those of us planning to not try this at home,
can we get to the graphite powder, please?
Oh, yes, of course.
Hmm. We might get a print off the index finger.
That's not bad.
Absolutely incredible.
Okay, I'm gonna scan it, run it through AFIS.
Maura, will you do the other fingers for me, please?
Maura?
What?
The other fingers.
Oh. Yeah, sure. Of course.
Okay.
Here's what I found on Giovanni's phone.
So, I'm pretty stoked to see
this Camaro and Mustang hit the track.
Maybe I can surprise them with my Alfa.
I'm still hoping to get a hit on his prints.
If I can crowbar a V-6 with a turbo in there,
it'd be a small monster.
Got him -- Alberto Santana.
He was paroled after doing a year and a half
into a five-year sentence for auto theft.
I want to talk to the driver of that Mustang.
There's not a single good angle of his face.
Ohh, this is hard to watch.
Ouch. That was not good, man.
Our victim's last known address was a halfway house.
I want to get in touch with his parole officer.
Okay.
Jane, you got to see this.
I'm telling you -- these freaks are serious out here.
Okay, 25k on the race?
$25,000?
A really good driver gets a third.
So, that's like $8,000. It could be enough to commit murder.
Can you show me what Giovanni has
on the other driver?
Giovanni mostly shoots Giovanni.
This is all I've got.
...after I beat you.
How many red 2005 Mustangs
do we have registered in Massachusetts?
Too many. I found 539.
Wha-- we got to go through all of them?
Can Frankie help?
I already tried. Martinez is using him for something.
Oh, goodie. Giovani's in the cafe.
I'd take him off your hands for you...
...but I hear he's a face licker.
Not my face.
Hey, Jane.
I hope you haven't put him in any danger out there.
He's in more danger in here --
of choking to death, ma.
You know who this is?
Mnh. Nope.
Mrs. Rizz,
this is the best plain spaghetti and meatballs
in the history of Italy.
I'm gonna look really good driving your Alfa.
I want to know his name, and I want to know it now.
Honest to god, Jane, I don't know.
They -- they called him "Rayo,"
which means, uh, "lightning bolt."
Man, I wish I had a cool nickname.
Why didn't you mention this Rayo before?
You didn't ask. Can I have my fork back?
Hey, you think maybe I'll get
a plaque or medal or something for my help solving this?
It's not solved, Giovanni.
Well, I gave you all the pieces.
Can't help it if you can't put them together.
That's it. You --
If you're gonna stab someone, start with your father.
Hey, how's he doing?
I heard he, uh, got himself a real fine lady.
Shut up!
Hey, Ang.
Hi, Sean.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
"Ang"?
What's next, a little PDA?
What's PDA?
Public Display of Affection.
You shut up.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
You need any help here?
No.
Do me a favor -- try this meatball.
Shut up.
What are you doing?!
Yeah, but there's no indication of a timing mechanism.
This has got to be an R.C.I.E.D.
Radio-Controlled Improvised Explosive Device.
It's so refreshing to have someone else
translate the acronym.
Yeah -- well, you know, the blasting cap we found,
the way the car blew,
tells me we're looking for a wireless detonator.
I'm gonna build an N.O.S. prototype.
And that's standard, correct?
In order to know what caused the explosion,
you try to re-create it?
Yes.
I just hope they found pieces of the transmitter.
And the transmitter could be anything
that emits an R.F. signal --
A radio, a cordless phone, a key fob.
I love that you know that.
This could be a micro S.D. card.
Jane said that the racers put cameras in their cars.
She asked me to look for anything
that might suggest the presence of a video camera.
You know, I noticed what looked like
remnants of a rubber ring on the dashboard.
I wonder if he had a suction-cup mount there?
It's a good place for a mini action camera.
You know, if we can recover what's on this card,
it's possible the victim recorded
his own vehicle as it exploded.
Maura found a micro S.D. card in the debris.
She thinks there was a camera inside the car.
They get anything off of it?
Well, the crime lab's looking at it now.
B.T. is convinced we're looking at an explosion
triggered by a wireless device.
I want to go through Giovanni's footage again.
Okay, see if there's anyone in the crowd
holding something that could be a transmitter.
Okay.
I got a hold of the victim's parole officer.
Elizabeth Keating -- she's with the family.
I was just about to go through the footage again.
I'll take Frost. Come on.
Thanks for meeting with us, Officer Keating.
Sure -- uh, thank you for letting me be the one
to break the news to his wife.
I've known them both for three years.
It -- it's such a shame.
Alberto was one of the good ones.
You know, he was always on time, always working.
What was his job here?
Uh, mechanic. He was really good.
This is his father-in-law's garage.
Alberto was trying to buy it.
On a mechanic's salary?
Is that why he was racing?
I had no idea he was racing again.
We think someone from that world --
maybe even the driver he was racing against --
sabotaged his car.
Alberto did time for using stolen parts
to rebuild engines.
Any indication he was back into that?
No.
No, his wife and I both worked to --
to keep him on the straight and narrow.
Did he mention anyone he was having a problem with,
a customer maybe?
No.
I wish I could be more helpful.
Alberto promised me.
He promised me that he wasn't gonna race.
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that's how he died, Mrs. Santana.
Elizabeth just said that it was a car accident.
Alberto's files might be important.
We'd like to look through them all.
Go ahead.
It's hard to accept that Alberto's death
wasn't an accident.
We're still investigating, sir.
Did you know he was racing?
No.
So, you didn't know any of the people
he might have been associating with?
He knew better than to talk to me about his racing days.
I can't believe he was doing that again.
I know Alberto was just trying to make things better
for me and the baby, Pablo.
He didn't have to race.
I should have just given you two the garage.
Papi. Papi.
Papi, it's not your fault.
Who's that in the photo with Alberto?
That's Alberto and his sister, Cassandra.
She's beautiful.
She died of a drug overdose,
and that's why Alberto hated drugs.
Did Alberto have a speciality,
something people sought him out for?
Yeah, he was a genius with motors --
guys who wanted horsepower, but didn't want flash.
He -- he'd put big motors in little crap cars.
What about his Camaro? Did he work on that here?
Alberto drove an old Toyota.
The only Camaro I know he worked on
was an old '88.
Who was the customer?
I don't know.
Did you notice anything about
your husband's behavior recently?
It might be nothing.
But it's worrying you. So, could be something.
He -- he was spending a lot of time here.
He was nervous, but...
I thought it was because of the baby.
But now I know that there was something wrong.
And the crime lab couldn't get anything off the S.D. Card?
Not yet.
Well, I went through the footage frame by frame.
Um, I couldn't see all the spectators,
but the ones that I did see weren't holding anything.
So --
Thank you.
Thought you said you ordered something good.
This good.
It's kale.
It's that thing on the salad bar that nobody used to eat,
but now it's the cool food.
Are you abstaining from coffee tomorrow?
No, I'm abstaining from kale.
No, you have a family history of cholesterol.
You need to take that test.
You're very nosey.
I'm very concerned.
Hey, I've got an idea -- bother B.T.
We haven't progressed to the point
where we're exchanging genetic DNA family histories yet.
You exchanged any DNA yet?
We've been too busy.
You know, he is doing a prototype
of the nitrous-oxide system
to determine where the charges were placed.
I apologize for the interruption,
but, uh, I finished the prototype.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Yes, it sure is.
Would you like to join us?
I can't -- yeah, I'm standing by at the crime lab.
They're making progress on that S.D. Card.
Oh, that's great. Okay.
Um, I'll call Detective Frost and see if he wants to help.
Or, uh...
You know, Dr. Isles is very good at...
standing by.
Aren't you, Dr. Isles?
I mean, it's -- it's -- it's your find,
so you both should be there,
you know, in case they recover something.
Okay. Uh, no. But wait -- what about you?
I don't -- I don't want to just leave you here alone
with -- with your kale.
Oh, I digest my leafy greens so much better when I'm alone.
Go. I-it's almost 6:00 a.m. in Afghanistan.
Casey will keep me company.
Okay.
See you.
Bye.
Can I join you for a beer?
No, it doesn't go with my meal.
I'm sorry about this morning.
Okay, thanks.
Let me buy you a drink. It'll be like old times.
And why are you suddenly being so nice to me now?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
I only came by to give you these.
Now you're giving me my car back?
DCU doesn't need it anymore.
Why? Because it got burned in an operation?
What? You don't want it back?
No, I do. Yeah, Raff, I do.
I-I do!
Thank you.
You come over here and offer me a beer,
give me my car back.
If I was a suspicious person,
I might think you wanted something from me.
Like what?
What do you got that I want?
Don't do this.
Don't do what?
We were good together...
when we didn't talk.
Don't, Raff.
I -- I'm -- I'm involved with someone.
He's not here.
We have to work together.
No, we don't.
I found it!
B.T., I found it!
Morning.
What time did you get in?
I didn't go home.
Any luck on the S.D. Card?
Uh, no.
Any luck with B.T.?
Sorry. Were you talking to me?
Is this what I think it is?
I don't believe it. You're incredible.
Yes, she is. What is it?
I think it's the receiver.
Yeah, th-the Boston Marathon bombers triggered the blasts
with toy remote controls.
This receiver proves my theory.
Someone at the race triggered the explosion.
Can you give me an idea of its range?
Please don't tell me you don't like to guess, either.
Yeah, I actually do hate to guess.
Well, I won't hold it against you.
Ask her.
Th-the type of circuitry used in this receiver
limits its range.
I'd say it wouldn't be reliable beyond 100 feet.
Thank you.
And don't be insulted, but I'm sending Frost down here
to help you with that S.D. card.
Nah, you were right, Jane. No one's close enough.
Unless there's someone in one of those buildings,
the only one close enough when that car explodes
is the other driver.
We got to find him.
Before we begin our presentation,
Sergeant Korsak, I'd like to acknowledge
your work on the computer today.
Thank you, Detective Frost.
I hope I'm about to acknowledge
your work on the S.D. card, Detective Frost.
You are, Detective Rizzoli.
Look at this.
Okay, that's Alberto.
It's bottle time.
Damn. - He thought he was turning on his secret weapon --
the nitrous tank.
Frost, can you play that back from the beginning?
Okay. Slow it down.
Go a frame at a time.
Stop.
Who does that look like?
No way.
Lieutenant Martinez was at that race.
And you've already poked around on the down low?
Yes, Sir.
And according to Martinez's secretary,
he hasn't been in the office much at all for a while.
What did Frankie say?
Well, I didn't want to put him in that position.
Well, that's the right call. Martinez is his boss.
So, what do we do?
We try and talk to him.
Do you know how many messages we've left?
Okay. So we wait.
Sir, we're investigating a homicide
that Llieutenant Martinez witnessed
and didn't bother to tell us about.
I got that, Detective.
Do you know what happens if I get into it
with the Chief of Detectives?
No, sir.
Well, why don't you tell him, Vince?
We start a ball rolling we can't stop.
It could be the end of Martinez's career.
You got that?
If you're gonna go to the principal's office
to complain about somebody,
make sure you want that somebody expelled.
Give the guy a chance to explain himself.
Yes, sir.
How long we gonna give him, Vince?
He's got a reason. I know he's got a reason.
Better be a really good one.
I've been through two years of Alberto's receipts here.
These are the invoices from the last few jobs Alberto did.
There's a handwritten note in spanish
attached to this invoice.
This invoice has a vin number. Will you run that?
Yeah, sure.
What's the note say?
En inglés, por favor.
"Front seat, heat on full, brake,
left signal, recline."
Huh?
Got me.
Vin number is for a Mustang.
The parts are for a stroker kit.
Well, somebody was getting their Mustang ready for a drag race.
Why would Alberto be souping up a competitor's Mustang?
Who's it registered to?
Miguel Ortiz --
No address, just a P.O. box in Jamaica Plain.
Damn.
Hmm. Looks like Miguel doesn't pay his parking tickets.
He got two dozen in the last month.
See if he's been ticketed in the same place more than once.
Nice, Jane.
He got five out front of 1268 Boston Street.
It looks like a warehouse.
And that's enough for a search warrant. Let's get it.
Why did we sneak in when we already have a search warrant?
'Cause it's more fun this way.
Best to do a search before the bad guys
know what's going on. Look.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?
Hello, sweetness.
Keys are still in it.
Korsak, you got that list?
Oh, yeah.
It's "front seat..."
Yeah.
..."heat on full..."
..."brake...
..."left signal...
Recline."
What are you doing?
Patience, Detective.
When you come into the country,
border patrol searches your car with the doors open, right?
Right.
Try again.
I know.
"Front seat, heat to full,
"Brake...
Left signal, recline."
Well, what do you know?
That was a sequence to open a hide.
And it looks like our friend Miguel was drug trafficking.
This one's coffee.
This one smells like cayenne pepper.
It's to throw the dogs off.
His wife said Alberto was worried.
Maybe it wasn't just racing he was into.
Well, Alberto was working on this Mustang.
You think he was being forced to build hides?
Boston police! Freeze!
Frankie, what are you doing here?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, I have a funny feeling we just walked
into the middle of an undercover operation.
Yeah, you sure did.
Which is why you should trust your colleagues
and share your information.
We're separate operations, Rizzoli.
What is wrong with you?
Whose side are you on, Martinez?
Better start talking, Raffie.
Oh, don't make us threaten you.
What do you mean, threaten us?
He didn't tell you, did he?
Lieutenant Martinez watched our victim
get blown up this morning.
He knew we were investigating a homicide,
and he still didn't come forward.
He didn't tell us he was friends with our prime suspect, either.
This is detective first grade
Miguel Ortiz -- NYPD.
You're a cop?
Yeah.
I brought Miguel in.
I've been doing this in New York --
infiltrating these street-race groups as a driver.
That's how a lot of meth is getting moved.
In hides?
Yeah.
Since when did meth become a problem in Boston?
Since it blew into town about six months ago.
Dealers have been popping up, giving away free samples.
Dealers -- like Jimmie Washington?
Is that why you barked at me about talking to your prisoner?
It was need to know, Jane. I couldn't tell you.
Wait, wait, wait -- so, whoever's running this thing
created his own market by handing out free meth?
Yeah, we don't who the unsub is,
But we know this guy --
Chapo Benavidez,
an MS-13 gangbanger from Boston.
He broke his parole two years ago
and fled to Juarez, Mexico.
He runs a methamphetamine lab from there.
He's been getting it to New York distributors.
But now it's found its way into Boston,
thanks to your unknown subject.
Yeah.
So, who is this guy?
Jorge Vega -- big meth dealer.
He runs all the street races.
It took us three months to get close to Jorge.
After the explosion,
he finally hired me to be a delivery driver.
So now you just sit tight and wait for the call
for that next load of meth.
Exactly. Any second now.
Did Alberto build the hide in your Mustang?
No, no. Jorge builds the hides.
He hired Alberto to do the engine work,
and then he found out he could drive.
Wait. So, Alberto wasn't a part of this?
So, why is he working on your Mustang?
He thought it was Jorge's.
The Mustang is registered to me, but Jorge owns the cars.
That's how he controls the races.
They're fixed?
No! Jorge's a cheater, too?
Alberto didn't know that.
He thought the races were clean.
But after he'd worked on the engines,
Jorge would load in a new fuel map.
So, we got means --
It isn't hard for Jorge to switch propane for nitrous.
Motive -- Alberto found the hide in your Mustang.
And opportunity -- Jorge owned
the Camaro that Alberto drove.
He couldn't have triggered the explosion, though.
Yeah, he was at the starting line. He was too far away.
So we're still looking for a second killer.
It's Jorge. It's him.
Rizzoli, please. Hold off on arresting Jorge.
We just need a little more time.
Look, we're not gonna step on
another units' operations, all right?
Do you have Jorge under surveillance?
Yeah.
All right, so he's not going anywhere.
You sure he'll roll?
He will if we get him with the drugs.
Well, then why are we standing here?
Let's go get them all.
Am I supposed to thank you for letting me come along
on what should be our arrest?
Sure, if you want to.
Stop.
What?
I am not gonna look at you,
and you are not gonna make me smile.
How much you want to bet?
You think I don't know that you do this to every woman?
Do what?
Pay attention. Jorge's pulling into the lot.
Okay, that's Jorge in the blue Civic.
Those are his boys in the truck.
Well, there's your meth.
It officially sucks. This one's yours.
Thank you, Jane.
You're welcome.
Why are you still sitting here?
That is a lot of meth.
That's it. Yeah, you run, Jorge.
Here we go. Oh. Get him.
Boston police! Down on the ground! Down on the ground!
Now, Cabron! Down on the ground!
Let's see some hands right here.
Got him?
I got him, papi.
Meth party's over, Jorge.
Jorge's lawyered up. My guess is he's afraid of this guy.
Well, at least he can't run.
His bail was set at half a million.
DCU hasn't found anything
at his house or his business yet,
Which means if we don't find that transmitter,
we can't connect Jorge to Alberto's murder.
I got bad news.
Jorge's lawyer just showed up with the bail money.
Great.
Huh. Next stop, Mexico.
Wow, kudos to you, Martinez.
I'm so happy we just stood back
and let you complete your operation.
Time for the BPD shuffle.
The what, Sir?
You would be amazed at how slow
Sergeant Collins in booking is --
can't find the ink, the camera won't work.
Oh, Vinnie, you're my boy.
No, no, no, no, do not smile.
You are not allowed to smile.
Why not?
Isn't it good that guys sometimes
get lost in the system?
Hey, Reggie, it's Vince. I need a favor. Sure.
I searched Jorge's Civic again.
He had a hide.
How did you get it open?
Persistence.
Look what I found in his dash.
Ah. Nice work, bro.
It's a programmer for car-alarm systems.
So, you can use that
to program a key fob, right? Yeah.
We need to get that to B.T., because if we can match that
to the receiver that Maura found,
We don't need Jorge's transmitter.
Hey, Reg, I need you to slow a guy down for me -- Jorge Vega.
Hairline crack in the receiver, but I think I fixed it.
We're about to try it.
Okay, turn on the programmer.
Jane, the programmer is set
to the same frequency as the receiver.
Okay, Maura, thanks.
We don't need the transmitter to nail Jorge.
He planted the propane bomb.
What we need now is the second killer.
Whoever triggered it.
Alberto worked on all of Jorge's cars,
but he had invoices and receipts.
So, it was on the up and up.
Yeah.
But what would you do if you were trying to stay clean
and you discovered that the guy you drove for
was a drug smuggler?
Alberto's parole would get revoked
if he knowingly worked on cars
with hides that were moving drugs.
Exactly.
Plus he lost his beloved sister
to a drug overdose -- he hated drugs.
He told someone about that hide,
and that's what got him killed.
The only thing that Alberto, Jorge, and Chapo
had in common was time.
They all did time.
Not in the same prison.
They still have a connection.
Everyone on this list
is involved in a drug-distribution ring
run by Jorge Vega.
Jorge is my parolee. He was distributing drugs?
DCU arrested him today for drug trafficking.
He had over 100 kilos of methamphetamine.
Is there anybody else on that list
that's one of your parolees?
I don't believe this.
Nearly all of them.
Oh, excuse me.
Would you like some more coffee?
Yeah?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
We're ready for you.
You must have had a great vacation. You're so tan.
Okay.
I did. I just got back from a mediterranean cruise.
Nice.
Okay, thanks. I'll be right there.
Thanks, ma.
Did you know that Alberto was working on Jorge's cars?
I didn't know that.
You -- you don't think that jorge
had anything to do with Alberto's murder, do you?
We're not sure.
There might be something
that you could do that could help us.
Anything you need.
This shouldn't take too long.
I'm happy to help.
Oh, hello, Sergeant, Detective.
Homeland Security has a nice photo of you
crossing the border in El Paso on your way to Juarez.
What?
Third time this year.
Must really like it there. Nice tan.
Maybe you got it visiting Chapo?
Excuse me?
You remember Chapo, right?
He's pretty famous.
He runs the biggest meth lab in Juarez.
Wha-- "Chapo" is a-a nickname.
It -- it simply means "Shorty."
Carlos "Chapo" Benavidez -- you know him, right?
Oh, he's one of my parolee skips.
Help me understand where you're going with this.
Dr. Isles, you want to take that one?
Of course.
As you know,
Jorge drained the nitrous oxide in Alberto's tank,
and he filled it with propane.
What do you mean, as I know? What are you talking about?
Two blasting caps like these
were duct-taped to the tank.
We going too fast for you?
Well, tell us if you need us to slow down.
The first blast blew a hole in the aluminum tank,
allowing pressurized propane gas to escape into Alberto's car.
The second blast ignited the propane.
We found a receiver
under the front bumper of Alberto's car.
We think the transmitter is a key fob.
You have your keys on you, right?
Yes, but I don't --
Get them out.
Push the lock button.
Now.
It's a simulation, of course,
but you just blew a hole in the aluminum tank.
Now push the unlock button.
I guess you remember that --
watching Alberto's car explode.
No.
Why would I kill my own parolee?
You forgot that part, too?
Alberto found a hide when he was working on one of Jorge's cars.
And he did the right thing.
He told his parole officer.
He didn't know you were also
Boston's biggest crystal-meth dealer
and Jorge's boss.
You have a nickname. Did you know that?
We've been calling you "Unsub."
You and Jorge killed Alberto to save your drug business.
Oh, god.
I want a lawyer.
Yeah. Get a good one.
Jorge's already trying to make a deal.
You're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Santana.
What? Where's you hot date with B.T.?
I heard you'd been fending of Martinez.
He tried. Wanted to celebrate.
You know, I am troubled that it was a woman running this methamphetamine operation.
Which actually worries me.
Why?
Because it... suggests I might be sexist.
I am more troubled by that fact that she was a parole officer.
I mean, she's supposed to be one of us.
You're eating kale!
I'm playing with kale.
Does that count as a serving of dark leafy greens?
No.
Guess what?
You know I can't guess.
I'm gonna have coffee tomorrow.
Jane...
And a next day!
You're impossible.
I know!
Eat your kale.
Ok. But I'm having french fries for dessert.
Of course, you are.
