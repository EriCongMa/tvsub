The Night Watch
When we spoke last, you were talking about the summer
that you ran away from home.
Why don't we start with that.
Uh, sure.
I wasn't really sure what was left for me back at home.
I thought I had learned all that I could there.
Um, it was time, uh, broaden my classroom.
And that's when I met Susie Johnson.
The first of your victims?
Yes.
What did it feel like when you were killing her?
Nothing special.
I have trouble believing that, Leonard.
How come?
Well, you killed 14 of them.
That you know of.
My point is that something drove you to keep killing,
so you must have felt something.
It was just a thing I did, you know?
People do things every day.
I, um, I didn't think you'd still be up.
Still up.
Did you eat?
No.
Me neither.
Why don't I make us
some huevos rancheros.
Tara.
Don't worry. I will dial back the jalapenos this time
so I don't blow off the top of your head like Mount St. Helens.
Stop. Just...
Stop.
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Doug.
We just got on a roll and I lost track of time.
It's research, ok?
It's necessary.
Wouldn't want to get in the way of what's necessary.
Look,
Doug.
These interviews with Ennis,
these late nights, this is important work,
All right? It's meaningful work.
I am trying to take
serial killer profiling protocol to the next level.
You're more interested
in a guy who killed a bunch of little kids than you are in me.
Um, I have to be in to the office
first thing in the morning,
So could we talk about this at dinner tomorrow night?
There's nothing more to talk about.
I'm going back to San Francisco.
What?
My flight leaves tomorrow afternoon.
And you're just announcing this?
Things haven't been good with us for a while now.
Ok, uh, I thought
the point of a relationship
was that you work through your problems,
not... Hop on a plane and leave.
I can see I was mistaken.
Thank you for
keeping it real for me, Doug.
Have a nice flight.
So Yogi Berra arrives at spring training
and the equipment manager says to him,
what's size cap do you wear?
And Yogi says, "I don't know,
I'm not in shape yet."
That's it.
That's the joke.
But studies have shown that dimensional changes
in the human head actually can fluctuate,
especially in the third decade of life.
Morning, guys. How do I look?
You look great.
Went on a diet last night, lost 185 pounds.
What do we have?
Ok, you know the phrase "art imitates life"?
This is like that but a dead version.
This happened last night in Detroit.
And if I can direct your attention to the signature.
Is that Morpheus?
Who?
He's a prolific street artist
who's been active since the summer of 2007.
He began using primarily
stencils and wheat paste, but in recent years
he's moved on to more site specific installation work.
The kicker-- No one knows who Morpheus really is.
Like that British graffiti artist... What's-his-face?
Banksy.
That's the one.
This is the only known photograph of Morpheus.
This was taken 7 years ago in Los Angeles.
No, that's no help. That could be anyone.
Do we know who the victim is?
Yeah. Russell Pearson. He's a community activist
who's been in the local news a lot
for opposing a controversial development project
that's supposed to revitalize the downtown area.
What's so controversial about the project?
Gentrification. Lower income
residents are displaced by luxury condos.
Good bet the only thing being revitalized
are the developers' bank accounts.
Morpheus has always sort of been the voice of the underdog.
I'd assume that he and Pearson
were on the same side of this issue.
Normally, yes, but Pearson, 3 days ago,
was in the news again for all the wrong reasons.
He was accused of taking bribes from the very developers
he was organizing against.
So this could be a dose of street justice.
Has this Morpheus ever committed
an act of violence before?
No, he's always advocated for civil disobedience.
Well, how do we know it's even him?
Morgan's right. Morpheus may beat the war drums,
but so far that's all he's done.
Regardless, tensions are already high in Detroit,
and this is only going to make things worse. Wheels up in 20.
"Ghosts were created
when the first man woke in the night."
J.M. Barrie.
Between his activism and bribe-taking,
Russell Pearson had no shortage of enemies.
Well, Morpheus isn't too subtle with his symbolism.
You stick your nose in the cookie jar, you pay the price.
How long has Morpheus been in Detroit?
Oh, I can answer that question.
Morpheus first popped up in the city 6 weeks ago.
I'm sending video to your tablet right now.
Vehicle as barbecue. What's that about?
There was a heatwave in Detroit in August
and a homeless woman and her child
locked themselves in a car to sleep
and died of dehydration.
Morpheus has done two more pieces.
The second one he took credit for,
but it was dismantled by a rival artist
before anyone could see it.
Didn't realize it was that cutthroat.
Yeah, competition among street artists is intense.
It's like turf wars.
Well, according to this, Morpheus has a website
where he always posts his work.
Yeah, that's right. He doesn't post any comments.
It's through a proxy server, so it's impossible to trace.
He took credit for the first 3 pieces in Detroit,
but there's been nothing on
the website about the Russell Pearson murder.
Because he didn't do it?
Or because this time it involved murder.
Oh, no.
What is it, Garcia?
Uh, something is terribly wrong.
A child's been abducted in Detroit.
Corinne Wallace, 8-month-old daughter
of Stuart and Katherine Wallace.
Stuart Wallace is one of the developers
behind the urban renovation project.
And there was graffiti and Morpheus' signature
on the walls of the baby's nursery.
Has there been a ransom demand?
I don't know. It just happened like 30 minutes ago.
All right, when we land, Dave, you and Lewis
go to the abduction site. Morgan,
see if you can locate the rival artist
who took down Morpheus' work.
Reid and I will go to the P.D., we'll contact
the regional CARD team and get set up there.
And, Garcia.
Yes, sir.
Your sole job is to find out the identity of Morpheus.
Use every resource you have available.
Finding him is our best chance of finding the child.
We're grateful for your assistance.
We've got an Amber Alert and tip line set up.
And the bureau's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment team are on their way.
Got the video from the baby monitor cued up in my office.
Thank you. I understand both parents were home
at the time of the abduction?
That's right. The maid, too.
And no one in the neighborhood saw anything unusual?
No. Happened in Grosse Point where the homes
tend to be on large secluded lots.
In this case, the family being wealthy works against us.
Ok, our guy comes in now.
Creepy how he plays with the baby.
We did a photographic
comparison of the signatures at both crime scenes.
They appear to be authentic. It looks like Morpheus is our guy.
I was in my study right down the hall.
Right there, 30 feet away.
I know it's hard, Mr. Wallace.
We appreciate you talking to us.
If we could, we'd also like to talk to your wife as well.
Katherine's upstairs in the nursery.
The police said it was ok.
If anything's happened to our little girl...
You can't blame yourself.
The hell I can't.
I should have seen something like this coming.
Why? Did you have reason to think she might be in danger?
Not her specifically, but my property was vandalized
and then Pearson turned up murdered.
I should have moved my family out of town,
you know, hired more security, something.
Wait, your house was vandalized.
My business. I've got a storage facility downtown
and that guy they call
Morpheus put graffiti all over it last week.
Even put it on his website.
Who is he, anyway, Morpheus?
How can somebody just not exist?
He does exist.
And we're gonna find him.
The maid said the doors to the house were locked.
That's right. They're always locked.
Mrs. Wallace, I know this is difficult,
but did you hear or see anything unusual?
Corinne's giraffe.
Ma'am.
Corinne's giraffe. It isn't here.
Are you sure?
She's right.
It's always in her crib. It's her favorite toy.
He took it.
That man took Corinne's toy.
Oh, honey.
He wouldn't do that if he was gonna hurt her, would he?
Take her favorite toy?
It's a hopeful sign, Mrs. Wallace.
You should try to get some rest.
Come on, sweetheart.
What have we got?
I've been working with Garcia to track the locations
of Morpheus' street art over the past 8 years.
This is a geographic timeline I put together.
Is there a pattern?
Not really. He mainly just criss-crosses
between Los Angeles and New York.
He's never really in one place for a very long time.
There is a higher concentration of activity
along the Gulf Coast of Florida, though.
That could be some sort of home base.
What are you looking for?
I noticed in Morpheus' early work
there's a synthetic cubist
spatial construction reminiscent of De Kooning.
So you're thinking he had some formal art education.
Exactly. And I'm hoping to be able to track it
to a specific university or school of training.
Good.
Well, it took a while, but I finally tracked down
the artist who took credit for dismantling Morpheus' work.
Markus Ivey.
He's on his way in for questioning now.
Anything on the missing baby?
Not yet.
What's this guy thinking? Murder, kidnapping a child.
He had to know that law enforcement
was gonna come down on him like a ton of bricks.
It's got to be personal.
I'm just curious as to if
Morpheus intends to remain anonymous after this.
If he doesn't, it's got to be an endgame,
and whatever it is, consequences don't matter.
What's up, Markus?
I'm SSA Derek Morgan. I just want to ask you a few questions.
I didn't kill Pearson and I didn't take the baby.
I got a gallery opening tonight. Are we done?
No. We're not done.
Have a seat.
I'll start with the obvious.
Do you know Morpheus' identity?
No. Nobody does.
Why'd you take his artwork down two weeks ago?
A better question is, why'd he put it up to begin with?
Let me tell you about Morpheus.
This dude comes swooping on in anytime there's a photo op.
Every issue is suddenly his issue.
Not here.
This is my city.
Detroit's own can take care of Detroit.
How'd you find him before anybody else did?
What do you mean?
Morpheus assembled his artwork in the middle of the night.
Remote location.
How'd you stumble upon it first?
He's gone predictable, that's how.
What he'll do, where he'll do it.
His routine's tired. It's played out.
Really?
I was kind of under the impression
that he was a really successful guy.
More successful than you.
Like the expression goes,
time will tell.
Did you ever think that
somebody else might just be setting him up?
No. Why would I?
Well, he seems like a pretty easy target, right?
With the secrecy and all.
Are you saying you don't think he did any of this?
Markus, I'm just having a real hard time
seeing the upside for him
to suddenly start kidnapping and killing.
That's what I'm saying.
Upside is people start paying attention to him again.
The man is desperate.
Lost his edge.
Morpheus ain't nothin' to anybody anymore.
So you think this is all just a publicity stunt.
What I think...
all this stuff now,
that's Morpheus trying to stay relevant.
As crazy as it sounds...
It just might work.
Garcia's slowly chipping away.
She picked up a money trail from Florida
to some of Morpheus' known locations in the past.
No viable leads, no ransom demand.
I mean, if it's not about money, then what?
Why else do children get abducted?
Normally with an infant this young,
we'd consider maternal desire.
But it doesn't really fit in this case.
And then there's human trafficking,
but then why bother leaving art behind?
That, and the Wallace baby's too high-profile.
traffickers usually prefer below-the-radar victims.
Just got a call from Markus Ivey's manager.
He never showed for his gallery opening tonight
and she wanted to know if he was still here.
We cut him loose hours ago.
I told her that. She gave me the address
of a private studio he keeps.
Sounded pretty worried.
Let's check it out.
Rossi.
Thanks. The Wallaces confirmed
the stuffed animal is the one missing
from their daughter's nursery.
This is a major shift in M.O.,
behind closed doors instead of out in the street,
Nothing overtly political.
It almost feels like some sort of taunt.
Elaborate staging this time, too.
The lullaby, the empty bassinet.
There's no doubt this is personal.
It's not about gentrification. This is about the baby.
Absent child. The abducted baby
could be a projection of the unsub himself.
Markus had to know something.
Or not. He might have just been an unwilling participant
in a bigger endgame.
Reid, do you have the photographs of Morpheus' artwork?
Thanks.
The signatures match.
Wait a minute.
What do you see?
Morpheus is always extremely precise with his signature.
It never varies.
It looks the same to me.
But it isn't.
The bottom of the "U" never
intersects the "S" In the mobile signature.
And look--the lower two horizontal bars of the "E"
fall just short of the left side of the "U"
and the alignment of the "M" is marginally off.
This is not Morpheus' signature.
A forgery?
That's what I think.
That means the signatures in the nursery
and the Russell Pearson crime scene are probably also forgeries.
Ok, well, that brings us back to our set-up theory.
So who would have a motive to frame Morpheus
for both the kidnapping and the murder?
Someone with an axe to grind, a grudge.
Is there another rival artist like Markus Ivey?
You know, I keep going back to the fact
that Ivey knew the location of the Morpheus work beforehand.
He told Morgan that it was because Morpheus
was becoming predictable, but I don't buy it.
What if Markus Ivey was tipped
by someone who actually did know Morpheus?
Like who?
I don't know, but think about it.
For Morpheus to stay
underground year after year, he's gotta have help.
Garcia.
‭Yes, sir?
I need you to start a parallel search
for a possible associate of Morpheus.
Ok, sure. I love parallel searches.
You should know that the original search is not going well,
and I would really appreciate it if you guys
would put your noggins together
and give me a nudge in how to proceed.
Ok, well, this person would follow the exact geographical timeline
that you built for Morpheus.
We think the unsub might
have his home base on the Gulf Coast of Florida.
See if any money from the various locations
in your geo-profile was wired to or from there.
That's a beautiful nudge. Thank you.
In Morpheus' first art piece in Detroit,
we found a distinctive blue chalk spray
with a uv-resistant fixative.
He used the same material in New Orleans several years ago.
I'd check to see if he ordered it from the same outlet
含防紫外线固定剂蓝色粉笔喷雾 全国供应商
or found a similar source nearby.
Uh-huh. Keep that coming.
This possible associate hasn't announced himself either.
It means he may have reason to hide.
Cross-check any names you get with those who have done prison time
or have outstanding warrants.
Ok. I am on it, she said with confidence.
Ok.
Let's get back to the P.D. We have a lot of work to do.
There have been Corinne Wallace sightings
from Mexico to Nova Scotia.
People are well meaning, but...
How are the parents?
Well, it's been tough.
They've gone to a hotel to try to get some sleep.
That's strange.
What is?
The Markus Ivey crime scene and the bassinet next to the body.
There's a small blue blanket.
What about it?
I've seen it before. Here.
In the car barbecue art.
What is it, Garcia?
I got it. Morpheus' associate or assistant or whatever.
Corey Marlin.
What makes you so sure?
Well, you said Gulf Coast of Florida.
He's from Tampa. He was in prison for 4 years
for beating a guy half to death in a bar fight.
He has a bunch of outstanding warrants from forever ago.
When he was in prison, he took up painting.
He said he wanted to become an artist.
Ooh! And the timeline matches, too.
Marlin fell off the face of the earth in 2007
right when Morpheus showed up.
If Morpheus has an associate, this has gotta be our guy.
Never mind associate. Could Corey Marlin actually be Morpheus?
Oh, well, that's doubtful.
Marlin's work may have wowed 'em in cell block c,
but he doesn't have the artistic chops that Morpheus does.
He did, however, wire money from an account in Sarasota
to locations that match the movements of Morpheus.
Every week like clockwork, up till 3 weeks ago.
Maybe the association ended.
At the same time the killing began.
{\fn微软雅黑\fs14- I'm sending all this to you right now.
Thanks, Garcia.
An Amber alert has been activated
in the search for missing 8-month-old Corinne Wallace
who was abducted from her family's home
in Grosse Pointe yesterday morning.
A primary suspect in the apparent kidnapping has emerged.
Corey Marlin of Sarasota, Florida.
The public should exercise caution,
because police say Marlin has a history of violent behavior
and should be considered armed and dangerous.
A tip line has been set up at Detroit police headquarters,
and anyone with information on the baby or Corey Marlin
is urged to call.
It took me a little while to find them.
This one's from the Markus Ivey crime scene.
And this one is from the burnt-out car art piece
Morpheus did a couple months ago.
It's two halves of the same blanket.
It's weird, though.
I mean, we know Morpheus was responsible
for the burnt-out car art piece.
His signature was real and he claimed credit for it
on his encrypted social media site.
But the Markus Ivey murder was done by an imposter.
So how did two pieces of the same blanket
end up in both locations?
Corey Marlin would have had access to Morpheus' materials.
Agent Hotchner.
There's a call about the missing baby.
I think you should take this one. It's on line 3.
Hello?
Is this Agent Aaron Hotchner?
Who is this?
If you want to find the child, go to 325 West Warren.
Who is this?
325 west warren.
You have 30 minutes.
Lewis, let's go.
It's a login code.
Agent Hotchner.
Who's this?
This is Morpheus.
Do you have Corinne Wallace?
No. That's why I wanted to speak with you.
I want to help.
How do we know you're the real Morpheus?
Right now all you need
to know is that I would never hurt a child.
This is Agent Lewis.
You're asking us to take a lot on faith.
Why would I intentionally expose myself to the FBI?
I came to Detroit two months ago.
I've only made 3 works since I've been here.
I don't know who killed those men or who took the baby.
Is there anyone else who could have access to your art materials?
Nobody.
Not even Corey Marlin?
Did he commit these crimes?
Absolutely not.
You seem pretty certain.
I know him. He was my partner.
But the partnership's over.
Yes. Why do you want to know about my materials?
You used a piece of blue blanket
in our first work in Detroit.
What is this about?
We have the other piece of that blanket.
It's not possible.
It's true.
I've told you enough.
We certainly hit a nerve.
What are you thinking?
What struck me was the concern for the child
above all else.
And did you notice the cadence in the speech pattern?
I think Morpheus is a woman.
Hey, talk to me. Any progress, baby girl?
Morpheus as a female helps,
but there are over 50 women in the Gulf Coast
that went missing during that time period.
Did any of these missing women
have an art school background?
Negative.
Well, keep checking.
Art galleries, museum employees,
elated fields like graphic design.
Ok. I'm all over this.
You know, Corey Marlin still could be our unsub,
despite what Morpheus says.
There's another possibility here.
Morpheus is the unsub, has always been the unsub.
Because?
Morpheus' career has been about manipulation.
You look that way, I'll go this way.
Rossi, you really believe that?
No. I still like Corey Marlin for it.
When in doubt, go with the guy with the long prison record.
It's been over 30 hours since Corinne Wallace was taken.
We're running out of time.
Corey Marlin turned up dead in a downtown motel,
bound and shot. Body shows signs of torture.
Any sign of the Wallace baby?
No. And no evidence of the child ever having been there.
I'll have agent Morgan meet you there.
You know, this could be Morpheus.
She and Corey had a falling out,
she knows that we're onto Corey,
Corey can reveal her secrets.
The torture doesn't make sense.
She didn't convey that level of suppressed rage.
Well, then it has to be someone looking for information.
Corey seems the only person
that could tell Morpheus' whereabouts.
Morpheus hung up on us when I mentioned the blue blanket.
That stopped her cold.
Wait a minute.
Wait, look at this.
This one is slightly more faded
and it's a little more worn out.
It's subtle, but it would take years
for cloth to degrade like this.
Whoever cut this blanket did it a long time ago.
They should be exactly the same, but they're not.
Morpheus came to Detroit two months ago. Why then?
The condo development controversy?
I don't think so. That's been an issue here for a while.
Something else triggered her arrival.
Well, then what happened two months ago?
The mother and child died in the overheated car.
And that was Morpheus' first piece of art in Detroit,
the one that she used her half of the blanket in.
Garcia.
Yes, sir.
Of all the women on your list, did any lose a child?
Uh, 3 did.
And of those 3, did any of those children
die between 2005 and 2008?
Mm-hmm. Ellen Clark.
She lost her 3-year-old son 8 years ago.
That coincides exactly with the emergence of Morpheus.
And what were the circumstances of the child's death?
Awful. It was a drowning accident
in a lake near Nokomis, Florida.
Oh, sir! It has got to be Ellen Clark.
She briefly audited courses
at the Glenbury school of Art and Design in Sarasota.
And what about the father?
William Cochran, who was a teacher there when she was a student.
That's how he and Ellen must have met.
He might have been her mentor.
Cochran was not at the school for very long.
He was fired after an altercation with another faculty member,
and he underwent a mandatory psych eval.
So there were indicators of mental instability from the start.
What happened to him?
After his son Charlie drowned,
William Cochran did some drowning of his own in alcohol,
and then he wound up on the street for a while.
And where is he now?
He moved out of state a few years ago.
Looks like he's been working as a handyman,
trying to put his life back together,
in Waycross. Georgia, where he lives.
What is it?
William Cochran is on the move.
he cleared out his bank account 9 days ago.
He booked a one-way ticket to Detroit.
I'm sending his photo and Ellen Clark's to you right now.
Thanks.
Shh...Quiet.
Look, I brought you a present.
Don't cry. You're gonna make Mr. Turtle sad.
It's almost over now.
Well, we sent Ellen Clark and William Cochran's photo
to every hotel in the greater Detroit area and nothing yet.
Ellen and William lose their son
and then things go downhill for William.
So did he grab the Wallace baby
so they could start all over again with a brand-new child?
I'm going in a different direction.
The drowning of the child ended the relationship.
William and Ellen each took
half of the boy's blanket as a memento, a keepsake.
But when William saw it show up in Ellen's art piece, he flipped out.
To him that was crossing the line.
And then he headed straight to Detroit.
To take revenge on her.
But before killing Ellen,
he had to destroy the legacy of Morpheus,
taint it with murder.
Yeah, but then why take the baby?
I don't know.
To remind her of the loss of their own child maybe.
And then he tracks down Corey Marlin
and tortures him to find out where Ellen is.
And hopefully Corey didn't talk, because if he did,
Ellen could be in some serious trouble.
It's been a long time, Ellen.
It's been a long time.
William Cochran's not registered at any hotel or motel,
at least not under his own name.
He could have some sort of short-term rental.
Or moved into some abandoned space. There's plenty of those.
But he does have a child with him.
He's gotta be careful.
He'd also need a space big enough
to build his art pieces.
If he came here searching for Ellen,
he probably set up shop in one of the two artsy areas of town,
but which one?
If he left his car in Georgia,
he'd need access to public transportation.
Within walking distance of stores for his daily needs.
And the baby's.
He was very gentle with the baby when he took her,
and if she at all represents the child he lost,
he'll continue to take care of her.
Proper baby food, diapers,
maybe a temporary playpen of some sort.
In the two arts districts, this one's mostly just warehouses,
but this one definitely has a store or two.
I'll have photos of Cochran
distributed to all the local shopkeepers.
The baby, is she ok?
The baby's fine.
You need to give her back.
It's a shame that you didn't care as much about our own child.
Maybe Charlie'd still be alive.
What happened to Charlie was an accident.
He was lying at the bottom of a lake,
while you were busy painting.
It all happened so fast.
I was sketching.
I looked up and he was gone.
Why did you do it?
Charlie's blanket.
You stuck it into that piece of art,
like it was some junk you buy in a thrift store.
I did it to honor the homeless child that died in that car.
And to honor Charlie.
That's a strange choice.
But life is just a series of choices, isn't it?
Stare at a sketch pad
rather than watch a child at the water's edge.
You sit down!
Let me tell you what's gonna happen today.
I'm gonna give you one last choice to make.
Either you're gonna die or the baby's gonna die.
Which one?
It's your decision.
Don't do this.
Who am I gonna kill, Ellen?
Tell me.
A store owner recognized Cochran from his photo.
He's been in twice to buy baby food.
She saw him go into a building across the street.
Time's up.
Who's it gonna be?
No.
Which one?
I'm not going to do that.
Which one?
No!
I'll kill both of you and starting with her.
No, wait!
All right, just kill me!
Kill me.
Ok.
Let's go.
Cover the back.
This way. Come on. Go.
William, please listen to me.
Shut up.
No. I know what you're feeling.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
I couldn't handle what happened either.
So I became somebody else.
Somebody who didn't let her little boy drown.
I miss him.
So do I.
We can't bring Charlie back.
Lewis, I'm going up.
But at least you can die knowing that
you saved another child's life.
I didn't make a choice.
Of course you did.
No.
You were never gonna kill that little girl.
I know you.
I loved you.
William Cochran, drop the gun.
Let Ellen go.
And drop the weapon.
I'm sorry.
How's the diet going?
I just wondered if you were trying to regain
those 185 pounds.
No, I think I'm gonna keep them off.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
But if it's any consolation to you,
I've been there more than once,
and I'm still standing.
Rossi...
do you think our basic personalities can ever change?
No.
Maybe a degree here or there,
but I...think we come out of the oven fully cooked.
It worries me sometimes.
Why?
I tend to be all in.
You know?
Damn the consequences.
That's why you're good at your job.
Embrace it.
I thought we weren't supposed to meet again until next Friday.
I moved it up.
Know what I figured out the other day?
What's that?
You think you're interviewing me.
