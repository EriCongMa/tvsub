she &apos;s getting dressed .
how is she ?
she &apos;s going to her mom &apos;s funeral . how do you think she is ?
question is who buried ali &apos;s mom in spencer &apos;s backyard ?
i think you need to look at this .
jason actually told you
that you shouldn &apos;t trust your own father ?
he made it seem like mrs. d was writing to my dad ,
&quot; i can &apos;t protect you anymore . &quot;
we &apos;re done fighting . which makes us what ?
maybe we &apos;ll be friends .
the truth will bury you in a new york minute .
i sent that text .
i don &apos;t have to hide , you do .
and you &apos;re gonna wish you stayed dead .
you made me dye my hair , you made me wear her clothes ,
you made me walk like her , talk like her .
if i hadn &apos;t given you the ali upgrade ,
where would you be ?
not the same .
it &apos;s time for a change .
exactly what is it you want us to do ?
i want us to stick together .
the bigger we are , the harder she falls .
you don &apos;t have to worry about shana .
she &apos;s dead , because i &apos;m responsible .
what do you mean &quot; responsible &quot; ?
i mean that i killed her .
stop . you don &apos;t need to run anymore .
&apos;a &apos; is gone .
you hate it .
no , i don &apos;t hate it . i actually really like it .
i &apos;m just confused why the sudden impulse .
i wanted to be spontaneous .
hanna , you &apos;re not spontaneous .
you make a pinterest board
before you change your nail polish .
《 红字 》
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
hanna .
this was shana &apos;s .
what ?
let &apos;s just put it back .
no , no , no . hold on a second .
oh my god , look what she underlined .
&quot; it is a curious subject whether hatred and love
be not the same thing at bottom .
each leaves the passionate lover ,
or the no less passionate hater , forlorn and desolate
by the withdrawal of his subject . &quot;
aria , it &apos;s probably just a school assignment .
no , this is about ali and jenna and us .
this is about being &apos; a.&apos;
no , this is about you trying to paw through shana &apos;s things
when you should be trying to forget about her .
well , there might be something in here .
just stop .
who &apos;s throwing out the scarlet letter .
i loved this book .
maybe you should get it for ali .
since she is planning on coming back to school ,
she probably needs it to catch up .
she &apos;ll get her own copy .
i &apos;ll take this one .
shana won &apos;t be needing it .
she transferred back to georgia , right ?
i don &apos;t know .
we barely remember the girl .
who could blame you ?
people come and go so quickly around here .
shana gone , ali back .
one girl checks out and another one checks in .
nice hair .
第五季 第四集
there &apos;s waffles if you &apos;re hungry .
what you got there ?
clothes for goodwill .
al , do you think it &apos;s a good idea to hold off for a bit ?
i wouldn &apos;t want you to give away
something of your mom &apos;s that you might regret later on .
these aren &apos;t mom &apos;s . they &apos;re mine .
i feel like i needed a clean slate .
okay . but do you feel like you &apos;re rushing this a bit ?
it might be nice to have some familiar things .
i &apos;ve grown out of this stuff already .
i &apos;m not the same person i was 2 years ago .
oh , i need some things before i go back to school .
notepads , a new backpack .
school ?
i can &apos;t stay in my room forever .
it &apos;s not helping .
and i need to go back if i want to graduate before i &apos;m 30 .
i want you to have that fresh start that we &apos;re talking about .
but i really don &apos;t see how that &apos;s possible if we stay here .
you want to move ?
no . no , i need my friends .
well , you &apos;ll still see them .
the place i moved into isn &apos;t that far away .
maybe the girls can come and spend the summer .
dad .
please . don &apos;t .
i can &apos;t have my friends taken away from me , too .
it &apos;s like living in the middle of a demolition site .
they destroyed everything .
absolutely everything .
mom , did you sleep down here last night ?
i wouldn &apos;t call it sleep .
every time i closed my eyes
i could hear the scraping of the shovels .
do you remember when you told me
that dad and melissa had been acting strange ?
yes .
okay , well the other day
melissa tried to tell me something ,
something important and dad stopped her .
and i think that it has to do with ali &apos;s mom .
oh , spencer ...
no , you know something &apos;s wrong .
okay . i can tell that you know .
they &apos;re hiding something .
i spoke to your sister .
the only thing that she &apos;s been hiding
is getting back together with wren .
that &apos;s why she avoided toby .
she &apos;s keeping other secrets .
morning .
what &apos;s the matter ?
or should i say what &apos;s the matter now ?
we were just talking about jessica .
how upsetting it is .
of course , you &apos;re upset .
we all are .
how much longer is our yard going to remain a crime scene ?
they said they &apos;d be done by the end of the day .
try to relax about it .
you too , spence .
do you think we could hire toby
this weekend to help us replant the yard ?
toby &apos;s on a job at guilford .
i don &apos;t think we can do this by ourselves .
look , mom , i will find somebody to help .
can we please just talk about this ?
no . no .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
our next door neighbor was found murdered in our backyard .
surreal doesn &apos;t even begin to describe this experience .
let &apos;s just focus on what we can control , okay ?
you &apos;re being naive .
we can &apos;t just call the thing off .
sure we can .
did somebody spit in your cornflakes this morning ?
why are you suddenly bugging out ?
i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m just having second thoughts .
she was held in a basement , okay ?
alison was kidnapped and blindfolded
and i don &apos;t even want to think about what else .
hasn &apos;t the universe punished her enough ?
what we &apos;re doing isn &apos;t punishment ,
it &apos;s a preventative measure .
that &apos;s semantics .
i never thought i &apos;d say this ,
but i feel bad for her .
it &apos;s hard to still see ali as the devil
when she just escaped from the hell .
what if i told you that her abduction story
is just that , a story ?
no one would lie about something like that .
she did .
and i can prove it .
58 seconds ?
that &apos;s all ? it felt like i was flying .
yeah , your technique is so much better though .
let &apos;s just keep working on increasing your strength .
you want to meet up tomorrow ?
yeah .
i have to check in with my family ,
but it should be cool .
oh , right . it &apos;s saturday .
do you need to--
no , i can still make it .
i &apos;m pretty much doing everything
i can to avoid spending time at home .
what &apos;s going on ?
besides my mom giving me the third degree ?
nothing .
ever since my friend ali came back
all my mom does is ask me questions .
and when she &apos;s not asking me questions ,
she &apos;s staring at me , waiting for me to talk .
so i &apos;ve started taking extra long showers
just to get away from her .
when the hot water runs out , i &apos;m screwed .
it &apos;s kind of natural though for her to have questions .
i would never ask mine ,
but it doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t have them .
what time tomorrow ?
let &apos;s meet up same time as today .
sorry .
no problem .
it &apos;s better than sitting in the cafeteria .
not really .
we &apos;re still a freak show .
now we &apos;re just a freak show in natural light .
i feel like we &apos;re lobsters in the tank at a restaurant .
you know , the ones that you stare at to see
which one you want to eat .
and then you see the lobster with like the chewed off claw
and then the rubber band is--
hanna , we &apos;re not lobsters .
relax .
oh , my god .
guys .
she is seriously freaking me out .
she knows that we were in new york .
she threatened ali .
what if she knows about shana , too ?
aria , look , you need to take a psychological selfie right now .
you &apos;re letting your paranoia get the better of you .
really ?
how do you know that all this isn &apos;t all about shana ?
because it &apos;s not . it &apos;s all about ali .
i &apos;ve been fielding questions about her all day .
yeah , me , too .
some people have been nice about it , i guess .
some people have been rude about it .
this girl in p.e.
asked me if it was true if ali was fed raw meat .
what did you say ?
nothing .
i just bonked her over the head with a dodge ball .
oh , my god .
it can &apos;t be .
it isn &apos;t . it &apos;s ali .
this is intense .
she &apos;s saying that because there were no obvious signs of struggle ,
they &apos;re gonna have to wait for the coroner &apos;s toxicology results
to determine her mom &apos;s cause of death .
the cause of death ? it was murder . duh .
maybe the cops think that she was poisoned .
how do they know that she wasn &apos;t buried alive ?
we don &apos;t have to pretend like she wasn &apos;t found in my backyard .
we know your family had nothing to do
with what happened to ali &apos;s mom , spence .
of course not .
i mean if they killed her , they wouldn &apos;t make a bonehead
move like burying her in their own flowerbed .
hanna , it &apos;s not helping .
yes , it is .
拜托你给我回个电话好吗
拜托你给我回个电话好吗 艾莉森
you hungry ?
not really .
i got another call from detective holbrook today .
they need you to come in for that medical exam .
what did you tell him ?
i was able to postpone it before because of your mom ,
but we can &apos;t put it off forever .
i know it &apos;s difficult .
but it &apos;s important .
and i &apos;m gonna be right there on the other side of that door .
dad , i don &apos;t want to go .
dad , please don &apos;t make me .
sweetheart , i &apos;m sorry .
i haven &apos;t wanted to push you to talk .
but if you were ...
hurt ...
you need to tell someone .
nothing like that happened , dad .
you know , i actually do think i &apos;m hungry .
i &apos;d love a sandwich .
coming right up .
i know you said you needed some new clothes .
i want you to buy whatever you like , okay ?
are you holding up okay ?
i &apos;ve been thinking about you .
wondering how you &apos;re doing .
definitely been better .
yeah . well , i wanted to check in , make sure--
oh , that i &apos;m not popping pills like breath mints .
well , i wasn &apos;t going to quite put it like that .
yeah . well , nobody ever does .
but people are running out of euphemisms
for a lot of things around here .
okay .
well , let me know if you need anything .
andrew , wait .
what are you doing tomorrow ?
i have a feeling you &apos;re about to tell me .

long time , no see .
so you &apos;re back at rosewood ?
homeschooling wasn &apos;t really for me .
it &apos;s kind of a game changer
when your mom can ground you and flunk you .
i heard about alison .
it &apos;s kind of hard to believe .
what did you hear ?
that she escaped from whoever it was that took her ...
that she &apos;s back in rosewood .
is she coming back to school ?
i don &apos;t know .
sorry .
i have to take this . it &apos;s ali .
no problem .
i &apos;ll see you .
hey , ali .
where is everyone ?
you &apos;re the first person to pick up .
i &apos;m going in for medical exam tomorrow
and i don &apos;t want to go alone .
can you please come with me ?
yeah , sure .
when should i pick you up ?
how &apos;s it going ?
i &apos;m just waiting for--
i was just gonna say you &apos;re doing a great job with sydney .
she &apos;s gotten a lot better .
it &apos;s really generous of you
to work with her on a weekend .
yeah , it &apos;s nice just to hang out with someone
who sees me more than just a friend of dead @-@ girl @-@ walking .
how is ali ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s hard to know what to ask or what to say .
so sorry i &apos;m late .
hey , paige .
see you around .
do you want to join us ?
yeah . come with us .
we were going to do sprints on the track .
really ?
okay .
let me just get some water .
you can just set those down right there , yeah .
sure .
just give me a sec to catch my breath
and wipe off the manure .
sorry .
thank you so much for helping out today .
i know it &apos;s really hard work and my mom &apos;s been intense .
intense ?
the guys who built the pyramids got more breaks .
can we take one ?
a break , i mean .
i &apos;d be good with either a bottle of water and a snack
or you making out with me .
still with the carpenter .
worth a shot .
let &apos;s just get the mulch out there , okay ?
because every minute those plant roots are exposed
my mom gets another gray hair .
shouldn &apos;t your mom be less worried about
what &apos;s going into the ground than what came out of it ?
she is worried .
she &apos;s really worried .
i think her freaking out
about azaleas is just displaced fear .
and she calls a security company yesterday
asking about a $ 10,000 alarm system .
and last night she slept downstairs in a chair .
just can &apos;t figure out if she &apos;s more afraid of
what &apos;s lurking outside of the house or what &apos;s inside .
what are you talking about ?
nothing .
there &apos;s the mulch .
what &apos;s up ?
i ...
spence , don &apos;t get too close .
sometimes when they think they &apos;re in danger ,
they play dead .
wait .
poor thing . poisoned .
what ?
that &apos;s so weird .
we &apos;ve never had a rat problem .
i don &apos;t even think we &apos;ve ever had a rat .
well , this was bought last week .
maybe it &apos;s a new problem .
this is too hot .
i don &apos;t care if it burns the roof of my mouth ,
i &apos;m starving .
i don &apos;t know how you can eat that .
mine &apos;s actually not that hot .
no , it &apos;s gross .
ranch and buffalo chicken ?
well , you know what they say ,
don &apos;t knock it until you try it .
i have tried it . remember ?
you made me
after anna nordberg &apos;s party last fall .
that did not turn out so good .
no , it didn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll eat anything except spray cheese .
if it &apos;s day @-@ glo orange and from a can ,
not going in my mouth .
take a deep breath for me .
and another .
good .
you have quite powerful lungs , young lady .
now if you &apos;ll tilt your head ,
so i can take a look at the place
where you were injured .
i want you to come back in again for an x @-@ ray .
the scar tissue may have trapped particles
from whatever caused the wound .
we were laughing and joking and then out of nowhere
she totally shuts down .
well , maybe paige is scared of getting too close
and getting rejected again .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s that .
what ?
nothing .
no , say it .
it &apos;s just i can &apos;t help but notice
that you &apos;ve been kind of mia about ali .
so have you .
yeah , that &apos;s why i &apos;ve noticed .
we &apos;ll get to me in a second .
i haven &apos;t seen you making any frequent trips
over there either , by the way .
her mom was found buried in my backyard .
okay , wait , can we back up a second ?
what are you saying ?
you think that i &apos;m scared to get close to ali again ?
do you still have feelings for her ?
i don &apos;t know .
i ... i really don &apos;t .
it &apos;s crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;ve wanted this for so long ,
a life without &apos; a &apos; and ali back .
i thought everything would feel like it did before .
but it doesn &apos;t .
em ...
after what happened with nate , did you , like ,
find yourself wanting to know everything about him ?
i received the package from nate &apos;s mom .
i was kind of obsessed with it .
i kept thinking what it must have felt like
for her to write my name ...
the person who had taken her son away from her .
and i studied the printing ...
kept imagining all the places
where i felt that her hands might have shaken .
good .
can you lie back for me please ?
you can sit back up .
if you scoot down to the edge of the table
so that i can get a better look at this .
there &apos;s no mention of this injury on the police report .
i didn &apos;t mention it ,
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t think it was important .
it &apos;s a significant injury .
how was it sustained ?
how did you get hurt ?
i cut it on a rock when i jumped out of the car .
are you saying this was from a month ago ?
are you sure ?
scarring is more consistent with a slice
rather than a puncture .
like from the blade of a knife or ...
i cut it on a rock .
maybe there was some metal on it or something .
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , it all happened so fast .
i didn &apos;t even feel it .
i didn &apos;t even know i was hurt until i looked down
and i saw the blood .
how was i supposed to remember ?
i was blindfolded when it happened .
didn &apos;t the police tell you that on the reports ?
are we done here ?
i still need the nurse to do your blood work .
and we also have to set up a time
for you to see a trauma counselor .
what were you just thinking about ?
nothing .
where &apos;s andrew ?
he went back home to change .
he &apos;ll be back .
i &apos;m gonna make him dinner as a thank you .
good .
he did such a good job with the ...
with the yard .
mom ? why won &apos;t you just talk to me ?
do you not trust me ?
no , it isn &apos;t about trust .
well , then why won &apos;t you tell me what &apos;s going on ?
please , mom , i don &apos;t want to be alone in this .
i don &apos;t want to be either .
ever since they found jessica ,
i &apos;ve just ... i &apos;ve had this sick feeling in my stomach
and it won &apos;t go away .
a couple of days after ali went missing ,
jessica came to the house and she was convinced
that you had done something to ali .
she said that ?
but she never went to the cops .
she did .
your father said that he was gonna tell ken
all about their affair and destroy their marriage .
so she stayed quiet .
but now that ken was divorcing her and ali was alive ,
what was preventing her from going to the police
and telling them what she saw ?
exactly what you just said that ali was alive .
but there &apos;s still a girl in that grave who isn &apos;t .
someone killed her .
and jessica was going to say that it was you .
i don &apos;t know ... i don &apos;t know if your father
had anything to do with this .
i want to believe that he didn &apos;t .
are you okay ?
yeah .
i can drive to longbrook tonight .
get us food from that chinese restaurant that you like .
what &apos;s that ?
can you take this ?
give each of the girls a copy .
they need to memorize it .
you recorded that ?
hanna , people have been asking a lot of questions .
we need to keep our story straight .
ali , i was here the whole time .
no , you weren &apos;t .
i was in this office like a half hour
answering questions before the exam even started .
well , even so , i mean ,
who &apos;s going to ask you questions about that ?
somebody will , somebody always does .
and if it &apos;s not holbrook it &apos;s gonna be someone else .
look , if they think i &apos;m lying about this ,
it &apos;s not gonna be long before we &apos;re all answering
questions about new york .
ali , where did that scar come from ?
the one on your thigh .
i know it &apos;s not from you being blindfolded
and jumping out of a car .
so how did you get it ?
i wish i was blindfolded when i got that scar .
did someone do that to you ?
did you do it to yourself ?
hanna , once you know something ,
you can &apos;t unknow it .
believe me , i wish i could .
sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
why are you here ?
we have nothing to talk about .
i disagree .
my answer is still no .
i heard ali &apos;s dad wants to take her away from rosewood .
he spoke to the school about it .
ali doesn &apos;t want to go ,
but maybe we can change her mind .
i &apos;d be lying if i say i didn &apos;t want
to see that happen , mona .
but i &apos;m not going to make it happen .
fine .
i won &apos;t twist your arm .
but just so we are clear ,
you don &apos;t get to be some sort of social switzerland here .
if you &apos;re not with me , you &apos;re against me .
i &apos;m not with anyone .
sure you are .
at least you want to be .
and emily &apos;s with ali .
mona .
i &apos;m just curious .
do you ever wonder when you became the very thing
you &apos;re afraid of ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
what is this ?
ali , no . don &apos;t , don &apos;t look at that .
maybe i should leave .
it was stupid to think i could get a new life
by just coming back from the dead .
is that what your text was about ?
you &apos;re thinking about not staying here ?
no .
we got the tox screen back from the coroner .
you did ?
what did it say ?
someone messed with her pills .
she had low blood pressure .
they found losartan in her system ,
which is for the opposite problem .
it stopped her heart .
spencer ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
what just happened ?
did you think your dad did it ?
it &apos;s hard , isn &apos;t it ,
thinking that your parent
could be capable of something like that .
i know .
i keep trying to find a good enough reason
that my mom could just watch someone kill me
and let them walk away .
it &apos;s just there have been monsters
under my bed for so long .
and now when they &apos;re not there anymore ,
i feel like i have to create them .
there &apos;s still monsters out there , spence .
they just ... they might not be under our beds .
sorry , it was really stupid of me not to call .
no , it &apos;s okay .
is everything all right ?
sit down , sit down .
i can &apos;t stop thinking about shana &apos;s family .
i mean , every time i close my eyes
all i can see is her grandmother
and just how destroyed
and how empty she looked at her funeral .
how did you know what she looked like at the funeral ?
&apos;cause i watched it online , many times .
aria , you &apos;re just going to have to find a way
to forgive yourself .
do you want to come inside ?
i can &apos;t stay long .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i think if alison comes back to school ,
you should keep your distance .
maybe it wasn &apos;t a good idea for us to hang out today .
it has nothing to do with us , em .
people are preparing for ali &apos;s return
and it &apos;s not with flowers and &quot; welcome home &quot; banners .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying your friend hurt a lot of people ,
me included .
and i &apos;m not interested in continuing that ,
but i &apos;m also not going to out the people
who feel like they need to protect themselves .
okay , paige , wait .
paige .
i &apos;m just a friend .
i wasn &apos;t able to send flowers
so i was wondering if i could donate
to the cost of the service .
well , her grandmother &apos;s
been a member of our congregation for a long time .
i &apos;m certain she would want to thank you for your ...
no , no , i &apos;d really , really rather the donation be anonymous .
is it possible to send cash ?
what are you doing ?
no . we can &apos;t accept cash .
i suppose you could send it to shana &apos;s grandmother directly .
aria ?
that &apos;s not trying to find a way to forgive yourself .
that &apos;s hoping that they forgive you .
it was anonymous .
i &apos;m talking about the intention behind it .
and even if they did forgive you ,
it &apos;s not like they would do it because of a donation .
you &apos;re right .
i know this isn &apos;t easy .
and i can say this to you ,
because it &apos;s what i have to tell myself every night .
once you found out about the book ...
the only thing that i could think of
was how to make it up to you .
and i would have done anything to get you to forgive me .
but i realized that that might not ever happen
and i had to be okay with that .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re playing checkers .
we are ?
and when we get sick of that , we &apos;ll play chess .
how &apos;s it going in there ?
did you find anything that works ?
no . no , nothing ... nothing worked .
hey , i got your message about the recording .
can i come over ?
i &apos;m confused .
i was with ali and she didn &apos;t even mention this .
she didn &apos;t ?
maybe that &apos;s because she asked me to give out the copies .
what &apos;s this for ?
is this ali &apos;s idea or yours ?
hey , it &apos;s not just about ali . it &apos;s about aria , too .
well , it &apos;s nuts .
hanna , think it through .
you &apos;re asking us to add on to the lies that we &apos;ve already told .
but just memorize it , spencer , okay ?
i &apos;m not gonna argue with you on the phone .
if you want to yell at someone , call ali .
i &apos;m sick of being the messenger .
no , i got this .
do you want to talk about it ?
there &apos;s nothing to talk about .
it &apos;s just my friend &apos;s being an idiot .
do you want me to ...
i &apos;m fine .
i should not be cleaning knives while i &apos;m angry .
losartan .
gin !
why are you so freakishly good at this ?
i &apos;m not . i think you &apos;re just freakishly bad .
thanks .
did i mention i am recovering from a gunshot wound
that might kind of effect my game , you know .
your turn to shuffle .
you know , i may need to call it a night .
i &apos;m kind of starting to fade .
oh . okay .
actually would you mind if i stayed here ?
on the couch .
my dad is up in harrisburg for mike &apos;s lacrosse game .
and i can &apos;t really face going home to an empty house .
yeah , you can use the blanket on the couch .
this is the one you liked , right ?
yeah . thank you .
you know what ?
i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m just going to go home .
thanks for the games .
yeah , anytime .
goodnight .
goodnight .
my dad got it for me .
it &apos;s nice .
yeah , he &apos;s finally coming around to the idea of us staying here .
yeah , i wanted to talk to you about that .
maybe your dad was right .
maybe it would be a good idea
for you to start over somewhere else .
what ?
i just don &apos;t think it &apos;s safe .
emily , where have you been ?
i walked into that police station because you convinced me to come home .
i know , okay . and i want you here .
are you sure ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel like it .
i &apos;m going back to school .
and if we just stick together ,
everything is gonna be fine .
did hanna give you that recording ?
yeah .
and i &apos;ll memorize it .
but this is the last time , ali .
okay ? i mean it .
it wasn &apos;t that big of a deal .
i know that it sounds bad
when i say that i almost slept over at ezra &apos;s ,
but nothing was going to happen .
yeah .
what i just said makes me sound like one of those women
who gets pregnant and claims that they have no idea how
and that it must have come from a swimming pool .
are you okay ?
when ali disappeared ,
mrs. d. told my parents that she thought
that i had something to do with it .
yeah , but she knows who hit ali over the head .
she knows that it wasn &apos;t you .
yeah , exactly .
but she was trying to set me up ,
but i &apos;m ... i &apos;m really worried
that my dad tried to stop her .
you think that your dad ...
yeah , and so does my mom .
i mean she practically admitted it .
hi , aria .
hi , mr. hastings .
aria &apos;s gonna sleep over tonight .
great .
where &apos;s mom ?
she &apos;s not coming home tonight .
i dropped her off at a spa .
she &apos;s going to spend a couple of nights there
to calm her nerves .
what ? when did this happen ? what spa ?
i &apos;m gonna go get ready for bed .
dad .
listen , i don &apos;t want you calling your mother and bothering her .
she really needs to relax .
why did she suddenly decide to ...
the police came by to finish up
what they were doing and she snapped .
luckily , i was there to keep them from pressing charges .
don &apos;t worry .
this will all blow over and she &apos;ll be home soon .
