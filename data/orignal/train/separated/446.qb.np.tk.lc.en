my girl &apos;s about to walk .
my old lady &apos;s like ...
bring home the double overtime .
you can &apos;t win .
tell me about it .
what the hell ...
probably drunk or high .
this is the work zone .
you gotta leave .
something awful happened .
this road is closed .
down by the trail head .
what is it ?
someone &apos;s been a real bad boy .
see anything ?
holy crap .
call the cops .
make sure that guy doesn &apos;t go anywhere .
all right , jack , try again .
i got it !
good try . good try . take it out , try it again .

i snuck out to see you and jack .
i gotta get back soon , though .
yeah , that &apos;s how you score , jack . good job !
you could do the same at my place tonight .
ha ! that &apos;s me being brazen .
shocking , ms. clemons .
well , just to prove that i don &apos;t have a one @-@ track mind .
there &apos;s also something that i would like to talk to you about .
what &apos;s up ?
it can wait till tonight .
or not . duty calls ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll make it up to you , i promise .

all right , go take one more shot .
i gotta go anyway .
so i &apos;ll call you when i get back and we &apos;ll talk , ok ?
yeah . i &apos;ll be waiting .
five days ago the yamada family went missing from their home
in kansas city , kansas .
last night a road crew found 3 members of the family ,
john , tricia , and their 16 @-@ year @-@ old daughter kristen
all dead , all shot to death and left at the side of a highway .
uh , they were tipped off to the location
by a drifter who is now m.i.a.
and the youngest child , scott yamada , is still missing ?
yeah . the murder weapon was an unregistered 9 @-@ millimeter .
it was found near the bodies .
there were prints on the gun that were the father &apos;s ,
and there was gunshot residue on his hand .
so he drove his family away from their home ,
hooded his wife and daughter , shot them , then committed suicide .
why do it out here ?
that is unusual .
most familicides happen in the comfort of the home .
so what happened to the son ?
he either shot him first or he wanted to spare him .
well , if he spared the son ,
it &apos;s most likely he left him in a safe place ,
maybe with a relative , before he carried this out .
next of kin hasn &apos;t seen him .
guys , wait a minute . the m.e. report said
the gunshot residue was on the father &apos;s right hand .
but he &apos;s wearing his watch on his right arm ,
which means he &apos;s most likely left @-@ handed .
maybe someone set the father up
to make it look like he did it .
excuse me .
hotchner .
i talked to local police .
there &apos;s no pending divorce , no recent job loss .
there &apos;s no obvious problems the yamadas were having ,
so they &apos;re treating this sudden disappearance as an abduction .
it &apos;s pretty extreme to take an entire family .
unless the son was the primary target .
and the rest of the family was in the way .
yeah , remember sexual predator matthew hoffman in 2010 ?
he killed a mother , son , and family friend
just so he could take the 13 @-@ year @-@ old daughter .
if we &apos;re looking at a sexual predator ,
scott could still be alive .
thank you .
another family , the acklins , have just disappeared
from , uh , lenexa , which is a suburb of kansas city .
a father , mother , 17 @-@ year @-@ old daughter ,
and 11 @-@ year @-@ old son .
the family makeup is almost identical to the yamadas .
the father &apos;s in the middle of a lawsuit for fraud ,
so they may have disappeared voluntarily .
we can &apos;t take that chance .
exactly . wheels up in 30 .
what do you want from us ?
he untied me .
mackenzie , help us . hurry .
mom--
braden &apos;s not here .
braden ?
do you see him ?
no .
braden ?
we &apos;re locked in here .
where are we ?
the german author goethe wrote ,
&quot; behavior is the mirror
in which everyone shows their true image . &quot;
aside from different ethnicities ,
the yamadas and acklins were remarkably similar .
john yamada was an engineer ,
and his wife was a bank teller .
mike acklin was a stockbroker ,
and his wife debra worked as a city clerk .
both upper @-@ middle @-@ class families
living in nice suburbs .
any chance these families knew each other ?
not according to my vast , far @-@ reaching databases .
what about the kids ?
anything stand out there ?
according to teachers ,
scott yamada was shy , introverted .
he reported being bullied once .
and braden acklin was recently diagnosed
with asperger syndrome .
so the kids weren &apos;t winning popularity contests .
you know , they could have been prime targets for a sexual predator .
braden certainly would be vulnerable .
unlike classic autism ,
language ability is intact in people with asperger &apos;s .
they appear to lack empathy
and have trouble reading social cues .
albert einstein supposedly had it ,
as do some well @-@ known silicon valley types .
well , how about you ?
what &apos;s that ?
hey , penelope , you want to tap into
those vast and wide databases of yours
and see if these families crossed paths unwittingly ?
even if they didn &apos;t know each other ,
they may have gone to the same place
and met the unsub separately .
yes , my sweet , delving into the digital abyss as we talk .
we all need to dig more deeply
for information about both of these families .
and let &apos;s not forget this is still an search and rescue
miission for scott yamada .
and if the unsub sticks to his schedule ,
we &apos;ve got fewer than 3 days to find the acklins alive .
agent hotchner ?
i &apos;m detective carr .
this is agent jareau .
hi .
tricia yamada &apos;s mother is here ,
as well as mike acklin &apos;s brother .
any luck finding the drifter yet ?
no , but we have this composite sketch
we &apos;re getting out there .
it &apos;s crucial that we find him .
given the description the road crew gave ,
he could be our unsub .
we &apos;ll double up on canvassing
homeless camps and shelters .
anything more on the acklin family ?
talked to mike &apos;s secretary .
the lawsuit really shook him up .
plus he &apos;s behind on his mortgage payments .
i gotta tell you , some folks here
don &apos;t think these two cases are related .
they think mike took his entire family and walked away ?
times are tough these days .
some people just up and try to start over .
where &apos;s scott ?
where &apos;s my grandson ?
we don &apos;t know , but we &apos;re doing our best to find him .
mike &apos;s a victim of the economy .
people have lost money ,
so they just want someone to blame .
would he walk away because of a lawsuit ?
no way . not in a million years .
i was the screw @-@ up in the family .
he was always the responsible one .
they were just an ordinary family .
who could have done this ?
there &apos;s nothing in the bathroom .
look again .
we &apos;ve been searching for hours .
there &apos;s no way out of here .
where &apos;s our son ? ! what do you want from us ? !
no , no , no , kenz . kenz , don &apos;t drink that .
i &apos;m thirsty .
it might be poisoned !
why are you yelling at me ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i overreacted , ok ?
just don &apos;t eat or drink anything .
help !
help us ! someone help !
please !
we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere .
scott yamada looks like a typical 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy .
this place brings back memories .
when i was a kid , i made a model of the universe out of salt .
was it for a school project ?
no , it was a birthday present for carl sagan ,
but i don &apos;t think he ever got it .
you know , by the way ,
no offense earlier when i suggested
you had asperger &apos;s .
none taken . when did you do that ?
and that &apos;s what i love about you .
you &apos;re not overly sensitive like some people .
i mean , think about how much time we &apos;d save
if everyone just got straight to the point .
yeah . cut out all the handshakes and how do you dos .
yeah .
this window was opened recently .
it was hot the night the yamadas were abducted .
first floor , open window . easy entry for unsub .
top bunk is made .
he probably wasn &apos;t in bed yet .
well , i think he slept on the bottom .
yeah , this tent probably made him feel safe at night .
he was probably looking at his fossils .
when the unsub entered ,
he dropped one when he was grabbed .
and then he was forced out of his room .
it looks like they were fixing themselves a late @-@ night snack .
beloved family dog is left behind .
you know , rossi , if this was all a ruse to hide an escape ,
it sure was an elaborate one .
then , again , people have staged their own murders to disappear .
rossi , look at this .
broken coffee cup .
you think they were caught off guard ?
i mean , being parents , the acklins would have been hard @-@ wired
to clean that up so their kids don &apos;t get hurt .
it could have been staged .
it &apos;s possible , but unlikely .
there &apos;s easier ways to fake a forced entry .
broken locks and furniture .
busted @-@ out window .
nah , i definitely think they were abducted .
it &apos;s not easy to subdue so many people .
are we looking at a team ?
yeah , this is morgan .
all right , i got it .
thanks , blake .
so , the point of entry at the yamada house was the son &apos;s bedroom .
so it would be possible for one unsub to do it alone .
especially if he had control of their son .
he &apos;d want the biggest threat , the father ,
under control first .
put &apos; em on if you want him to live .
you take me . you leave my family alone .
i said put &apos; em on !
the unsub forces the father and daughter to wear hoods .
you !
tie up their hands .
the mother &apos;s in the kitchen .
she ties up her husband and the daughter .
please--please don &apos;t hurt us .
braden , tie her up . here .
then the unsub makes the boy tie up the mother &apos;s hands .
there &apos;s a lot of distance between neighbors here .
late at night , no one would have heard a thing .
please !
he &apos;s an 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy !
it &apos;s ok , kenz .
it &apos;s ok .
where &apos;s my family ?
they &apos;re safe .
if you behave , they &apos;ll stay safe .
are you mad at my dad ?
are you mad at my mom ?
why are you doing this ?
tell you what .
you get 3 guesses .
if you &apos;re right , i &apos;ll let your family go .
if you &apos;re wrong ,
they &apos;re dead .
hey , what is that ?
the construction site where they found scott yamada &apos;s body
was shut down for two weeks because of permit issues .
it just reopened .
the body would have been easy to dump there .
it was outside the fence
and there were no security cameras or guards .
but he left the boy near the front gate .
he knew he &apos;d be found quickly .
the m.e. said scott yamada wasn &apos;t sexually assaulted or tortured .
c.o.d. was a single gunshot . he died shortly after the family .
his body was dumped 3 days ago .
so it doesn &apos;t fit the profile of a preferential sex offender .
the body was carefully wrapped , though ,
showing some concern or remorse for the boy .
well , what was the motive , then ,
for kidnapping and killing the rest of the family ?
to get the boy alone for card games and hot chocolate ?
no , it &apos;s possible the unsub
had some affinity or affection for scott .
yes , or maybe we have this all wrong .
i mean , what if the rest of the family was the target all along ?
and scott was just a tool to control them ?
well , the father was made to look like the perpetrator ,
either as a forensic countermeasure
or because he was symbolic in some way to the unsub .
go ahead , garcia .
ok , i can only find one connection
between these two families and this is it .
they both vacationed at a placed called ravenwood camp
outside of topeka at different times last year .
the yamadas in april and the acklins in july .
we should check it out .
we &apos;ll need the names of all the staff and anyone
who overlapped the stays of the two families .
got it .
mike , you &apos;ve been doing that all morning .
it is not working .
do you think he knows braden &apos;s sick ?
he &apos;s not sick .
asperger &apos;s makes him gifted in certain ways .
mike , will you please stop !
oh , my god .
is that vanessa ?
can anybody hear me ? ! somebody , please !
vanessa ?
can you see us ?
mike , tell your family who this is .
it &apos;s vanessa , my son &apos;s tutor .
why is she--
tell them who she is .
he said it &apos;s our son &apos;s tutor .
now , what did you do to braden ?
last chance , mike .
who is vanessa ?
i told you already . i don &apos;t know anything else about her .
the truth will set you free , mike .
what is he talking about ?
tell them , or braden is dead .
come on , dad , just say it .
i was , uh ...
i slept with her .
it only happened twice and it was over .
i swear , she meant nothing to me .
you all have to ask yourselves why you &apos;re here .
are you kidding me ?
we &apos;re here because you couldn &apos;t keep your pants on ?
you endangered this entire family ?
you put us in the hands of a psychopath
who took our son ? !
who cares at this point who dad slept with ? !
we are trapped here and braden is with some psycho !
deb--
don &apos;t ....
talk to me .
do you know what the biggest problem in america is today ?
we &apos;re losing the war against antibiotic resistance .
smartphones . i saw this family
in a restaurant the other day
and no one was talking to each other .
they were all on their phones .
texting , tweeting , emailing , what have you .
it &apos;s why the family unit is dying .
pretty extreme view .
not when you see the result of
eliminating modern @-@ day distractions like we do .
families ride horses together .
they hike . roast marshmallows .
they reconnect .
sounds idyllic . let me ask you this .
did the yamadas or the acklins seem troubled to you ?
they pretended like they weren &apos;t ,
but you can &apos;t hide that stuff .
from what i recall , mr. and mrs. yamada
argued in their cabin at night .
the acklins ? huh . hardly spoke to each other
the entire week they were here .
so i guess you might say
that their stays weren &apos;t exactly successful .
we &apos;re not miracle workers .
we just want to start the healing process .
do you get angry when it doesn &apos;t work ?
because you sent multiple emails to both families
insisting they return to ravenwood soon
or they &apos;d regret it .
no offense , but you kind of strike me as the type of guy
who needs to get his point across .
so you think what ?
i hurt them ?
there &apos;s this thing called marketing .
my tactics may be aggressive , but they work .
so , you &apos;re not a murderer . you &apos;re just a businessman .
hey . so , mrs. acklin was all over social media .
she posted lots of happy pics of the family
and updated her status almost daily .
&quot; mackenzie &apos;s on the short list for prom queen .
let &apos;s wish her luck . &quot;
are all the messages like that ?
yeah , pretty much .
everything &apos;s about how wonderful the family is ,
with lots of exclamation points .
it &apos;s interesting , considering the problems they &apos;ve had .
what about the yamadas ?
uh , yeah , they &apos;ve got their own web page , too .
lots of photos of a smiling , happy family .
just like debra acklin .
hey , sweetness , what do you got ?
tidbits as juicy as you , love shack . listen up .
debra acklin has been diagnosed with severe depression .
she &apos;s been seeing a therapist for the last 5 years .
john yamada has a numbered offshore account in panama
that he has made multiple cash withdrawals from .
i found out about it when i learned
that he visited there by himself two years ago .
well , that could have been for illegal activity
like drugs or gambling .
oh , indeed it could have .
and then there &apos;s debra &apos;s various social media pages
in the yamada &apos;s familiy website
and yeah , i know . we were just taking a look at them .
you &apos;re not the only one .
there &apos;s someone with an i.d. &quot; all eyes &quot;
that has visited each page every day for the last year
up until each family &apos;s disappearance . coincidence ? methinks not .
can you track the i.p. address ?
no , i can &apos;t . it &apos;s like kryptonite .
it &apos;s been routed through multiple proxy servers .
all right , thanks , mama .
we just picked up the drifter .
his name is nathan eads . we ran him through vicap ,
it turns out he &apos;s suspected of robbing and killing a couple
in omaha in &apos; 03 .
mr. eads , please sit down .
how did you find the yamadas ?
yamada . they &apos;re a fine family in japan i have tea with .
how did you find the dead family ?
i was asleep in the ravine and they appeared like magic ,
not far away .
like magic ?
a sorcerer brought them in a base camp of pleasure
and left them in a state of peace .
tell me , what color was the base camp of pleasure ?
dark as the midnight sky .
i say he &apos;s guilty .
we &apos;re testing the dried blood on his jacket right now
for a match with the yamadas .
it &apos;s not him .
are you sure ?
he sounds wacky enough to have done it .
no , his thought process is too disorganized .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s capable
of holding a family captive for multiple days .
but he talked about the bodies being dumped .
he was a witness .
and he describes the unsub &apos;s vehicle .
in the nineties , when minivans were getting popular ,
the automakers in japan called them base camps of pleasure .
we &apos;re ready to give the profile .
do you want money from my parents ?
no . two more guesses .
do you have a crush on mackenzie ?
no .
last guess .
want to try ?
do you know about the samurai ?
they were warriors who believed in loyalty and honor .
their job was to protect their lord and his family ,
and to kill themselves in shame if they failed .
would you like to paint one ?
familicides by non @-@ family members are rare .
now , we &apos;re looking for an unsub without a family
who is envious and wants to destroy
the very thing that he cannot have .
he was raised in a dysfunctional family ,
which he lost or may have even murdered .
these abductions were not random .
he monitored the families on the internet
and picked them because their dynamics mirror his own ,
yet they project the appearance of perfection
that he fantasizes about .
he blames these fathers for their mistakes ,
and then he punishes the families
and makes it appear as if the father is the culprit .
and the young sons who were abducted
are likely to be surrogates for the unsub himself .
they may be at the age he was
when the negative life @-@ threatening event happened .
he connects to them ,
therefore he may be in a state of arrested development .
this doesn &apos;t protect the kids , however ,
as evidenced in the killing of scott yamada .
the unsub may have seen this death as a merciful act .
he &apos;s familiar with the abduction and body disposal sites ,
and there &apos;s a secondary crime scene in between
where he holds and interacts with the families .
this secondary location is secluded .
it &apos;s been set up in advance for the crimes
and allows him to be in complete control .
our unsub is likely in this mid @-@ 40s ,
and he has the intelligence to plot , plan , and effect
these abductions and murders .
the vehicle he drives is a dark minivan or cargo van ,
probably with tinted windows , soundproofing ,
and retrofitted with restraints to hide his victims inside .
and given his timeline ,
he &apos;s probably already surveilling his next family .
i just spoke with mackenzie acklin &apos;s counselor .
she &apos;s been dating a boy for the past year ,
who is bad news .
darren wilson .
he graduated two years ago , has a rap sheet .
he was dealing drugs to rich kids and professionals .
is he still dealing ?
probably so .
he has a job downtown at a check cashing place .
well , apparently mackenzie has been getting deeper into drugs .
maybe she owed someone money .
the family kidnapping could be some kind of payback .
it &apos;s extreme , but we can &apos;t ignore the criminal element here .
but there &apos;s no drug connecting with the yamadas .
we don &apos;t know that .
it &apos;s unclear what john yamada &apos;s cash withdrawals were for .
jj , let &apos;s go talk to darren .
we gotta get past this .
i don &apos;t have to do anything .
would you look at me ?
vanessa died yesterday .
our son could be dead , too .
i already said i &apos;m sorry .
what--what more do you want ?
i want you to suffer .
i want you to crawl across broken glass .
i want you to know what it feels like
to have your heart ripped out of your chest !
go ahead , i &apos;ll take it . go ahead .
stop it , mom , stop !
vanessa came on to him .
i saw it .
mackenzie , i don &apos;t care if she was dancing naked
with the keys to a ferrari in her mouth .
you should have said , no , thank you .
i am a married man and stay the hell away .
what is that ?
those are my painkillers from my surgery two years ago .
i thought you said the housekeeper stole them .
tell her what really happened , mackenzie .
i took them to get high .
why does this even matter to you ?
give me my brother back , you creep !
you said you didn &apos;t start taking drugs until last year .
yeah , well , i lied .
your pills were the first drugs i ever took .
did you know about this ?
stop ! stop blaming dad for everything .
are you implying this is my fault ?
yeah . maybe i am .
maybe i took them to see if you &apos;d notice .
if i &apos;d notice ?
god , you are so checked out .
i even thought about setting the house on fire once .
i &apos;d just had a hysterectomy !
no ! no , you &apos;ve been like
this fake person behind a fake smile forever .
i &apos;ve done back flips trying to help you !
do you know hard
it &apos;s been keeping your addiction a secret from everyone ?
why do you care about that ?
you &apos;re so concerned about appearances .
it doesn &apos;t matter !
are you so naive as to think that our daughter
could go to a good school and--and have a decent job ,
when the world knows that she is a junkie ?
i am trying to protect her future .
why don &apos;t you try being her mother ,
taking care of her now ?
we &apos;re agents rossi and jareau from the fbi .
we need to talk to darren wilson .
he &apos;s not here .
we were told he was working this shift .
he didn &apos;t show . i &apos;m filling in .
is wilson absent a lot ?
what can i say ? he &apos;s a bad @-@ ass kid
who gets away with murder &apos; cause his uncle owns the joint .
do you know this girl ? you seen her around ?
no , but i &apos;ve seen that woman .
when ?
two weeks ago . she came in for a loan .
5 gs . i write it up .
and when was that loan due ?
last friday . she didn &apos;t pay it back .
thank you .
rossi .
copy that .
the police just found the body of vanessa hall ,
braden acklin &apos;s tutor ,
dumped on route 32 .
cause of death is 9 @-@ millimeter gunshot to the chest .
same as the other victims .
seems to be our unsub &apos;s weapon of choice .
t.o.d. is less than 24 hours ago .
looks like she was bound at the wrist and ankles , premortem .
was she tortured ?
no clear sign of it ,
but she has bruising and torn hair follicles
from fighting her assailant .
there &apos;s also motile semen present .
so it &apos;s possible she was raped before she was killed .
we &apos;ve sent a sample to the lab .
you &apos;re on speaker , garcia .
i was just looking through vanessa &apos;s cell phone records ,
and she got a text message the night the acklins were abducted .
who was it from ?
ross acklin . that &apos;s mike &apos;s brother .
you &apos;ve already talked to him .
&quot; meet at the red rose motel ,
room 8 , 10 a.m. &quot;
were you sleeping with vanessa ?
no .
but mike was .
i was setting up a meeting for them .
why would you do that ?
he was worried that debra would check his cell phone .
i wouldn &apos;t put it past her .
so you don &apos;t like her very much .
all she did was ride mike about money
and spend it like crazy .
so you did him this big favor
because you don &apos;t care for his wife .
look , i didn &apos;t want to . mikey begged me .
so why didn &apos;t you mention any of this before ?
it wasn &apos;t relevant .
i ...
i mean , lots of guys have affairs .
according to her roommate ,
vanessa went to the red rose motel and was never seen again .
if mike was already missing ,
you &apos;re the only one who knew she was there .
what , you think i killed her ?
maybe you killed them all .
mike had a family . he had a young girlfriend .
as far as i can tell , you have no one .
maybe he had everything , you had nothing .
maybe you raped vanessa before you killed her .
i &apos;ve been harassing the police ,
trying to get them to investigate .
why would i do that if i were guilty ?
the semen analysis came back .
it matches a dna sample from mike acklin we picked up at his house .
no . you know what ?
i refuse to be your scapegoat anymore , mackenzie .
i did not cause your problems .
of course not , mom , because you are so perfect .
stop . just stop it . both of you , stop , stop .
we don &apos;t know what he &apos;s done to braden .
why are we here ? he told us to ask ourselves that .
maybe it is my fault . i ...
i &apos;ve been an inadequate husband and father ,
i admit that .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m sorry , too , dad .
is this what you want ? !
to watch us break down ?
darren ?
darren !
so , debra acklin borrows 5 grand from a loan shark ,
which she should have paid back 5 days ago .
talk about asking to get murdered .
yeah , but if this was about the money ,
why did the unsub kill the tutor ?
that &apos;s a good question . i mean ,
how does this relate to the yamadas ?
the fact is , both families
had more problems than they were letting on .
which the unsub was privy to ,
otherwise why murder the tutor ?
the unsub knew about the affair .
and john yamada was made to look like a family annihilator .
it &apos;s a way of shaming him , forcing him to take responsibility .
he wasn &apos;t jealous of the families , he was angry at them ,
making them pay a price for their mistakes .
and he would use anyone in the family &apos;s periphery to do so .
we should see if any recent homicides
are connected to the yamadas .
so this guy was doing more than stalking them online .
he knew their secrets . but how ?
you have a choice , debra .
you can save him or you can have the money .
think about it .
mom--mom , you have to save him .
why ?
why should i ?
he is the reason that you got hooked on pot
no .
and cocaine and god knows what else .
no , no , no , mom , it &apos;s not like that .
please , i love him .
you love him ? mackenzie , he &apos;s a lowlife .
he &apos;s a lowlife and i despise him .
no . i don &apos;t have to think about it . i &apos;ll take the money .
no ! no , mom , please , you can &apos;t , you can &apos;t !
remember , you &apos;re choosing the money over someone &apos;s son .
i don &apos;t care .
mom , mommy !
no , no , i &apos;m doing us all a favor .
darren , no ! no !
i &apos;m gonna save us . i &apos;m doing us all a favor .
debra acklin definitely had a shopping compulsion .
lots of pricey handbags and designer clothes
with the tags still on them .
well , the bed &apos;s made , but it &apos;s uneven .
only one person &apos;s been sleeping here .
my guess is it &apos;s debra .
that would explain the pillow and the blankets
down in mike &apos;s office .
rossi , this house was built in the seventies , right ?
looks like it to me .
but the interior &apos;s been remodeled .
and i &apos;d say within the last few years .
it &apos;s a powerline network adaptor .
that &apos;s an odd place for the internet .
not if you &apos;re john yamada
and you &apos;re camped out here .
look at this .
point spreads for nfl games .
john was gambling the family money away .
hey , morgan .
same here .
parents sleeping in different beds .
was this house remodeled ?
it &apos;s a tudor revival house ,
which means it was built in the 1940s .
but i see hardware fixtures from the 1980s ,
composite window moldings from 2000--
that would be yes .
yeah , let me see .
well , i &apos;ll be .
there were cameras everywhere ,
mainly in the lighting wells and vents .
they did renovations ,
so it could have been a contractor .
it &apos;d be easy for someone with that kind of access
to set up a surveillance system .
and contractors are people you can ignore
after they &apos;ve been in your house for a while .
you &apos;re on speaker , penelope .
your theory is confirmed .
the yamadas remodeled their house in 2009,
the acklins in 2010 .
same general contractor ?
uh , negative . two different generals ,
some of the same subs--
hockney drywall ,
a.r. electrical ,
milman and sons flooring ...
a.r. electrical .
one of the contractors
who found scott yamada &apos;s body at the construction site was arthur rykov .
we need an address , garcia .
here it comes .
come on , where are you ? i gave you my answer .
where is my money ?
isn &apos;t the more important question , &quot; where is my son ? &quot;
what ?
where is he ?
you give us back braden , you son of a bitch !
mommy ?
daddy ?
braden . braden ...
what the hell is this ?
i &apos;m just confirming the choice you made ,
the money instead of your son &apos;s life .
what ?
braden .
braden .
no ! aah !
i never said that i would kill my son .
you were willing to kill someone &apos;s son .
does it matter which one ?
just tell us what you want and you can have it !
no , i don &apos;t want the money . i &apos;m so sorry .
i made a terrible mistake . please .
please don &apos;t kill my little braden . please ...
no !
arthur rykov , 46 . never married ,
lives alone on a 10 @-@ acre ranch .
he had a brush with the law when he was 16,
and that &apos;s where we know most of our info on him .
what happened when he was 16 ?
he was questioned by police regarding an assault
on a teacher at his school .
after his mother died , he was raised
by his strict russian orthodox father ,
who saw his son as an obstacle to his religious devotion .
rykov says he fell in love
with the perfect family across the street .
he watched them for years ,
imagined he was one of them .
until the day he saw the teacher
kissing the father in her car .
so rykov attacked the teacher .
he denied it .
police never found any conclusive evidence , so ...
so a 16 @-@ year @-@ old boy takes revenge on a teacher
for ruining his perfect family .
so he &apos;s been looking for another one
to replace them all this time ?
if we &apos;re here because of me ,
i will take full responsibility .
are you changing your mind ?
yes !
that can be done .
but every choice has a consequence .
i &apos;ll do anything .
there &apos;s a key taped under the bar .
under the stereo is a locked cabinet .
open it .
open the box inside .
open it .
if you all kill yourselves now ,
you can save braden .
what kind of sick game are you playing ?
this isn &apos;t a game . this is life .
you all turned it into a game .
no ! no , we didn &apos;t !
you gambled everything you had , for what ?
a little excitement ?
everyone goes through stuff like this .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re human beings .
things happen !
no , things don &apos;t just happen .
you made choices .
the wrong choices .
rykov didn &apos;t have the social skills to create his own family .
well , there &apos;s no such thing as a perfect family .
it &apos;s a childhood fantasy .
maybe he thinks he can fix them .
that &apos;s why he kidnaps them .
but when he fails , he has no choice but to kill them .
but why start now ? why in his mid @-@ 40s ?
he needed a remote location to carry out his fantasies .
right you are , girl wonder .
it looks like he saved up for the place ,
bought it two years ago , paid all cash .
hey , the yamadas were about to send their daughter
to a boarding school in ohio .
that must have been the trigger .
he had to kidnap the family while they were all still together .
what have i done ?
i drove you all away .
this is all my fault .
no . how is killing ourselves the right choice ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
if you truly loved each other ,
you would die for each other .
who are you ? why do you care
how much we love each other ?
because a family is a precious gift
you can &apos;t take for granted .
do it , mike .
do it , mike .
do it now .
do it .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
i won &apos;t kill my wife and child .
you won &apos;t save braden ?
please . he &apos;s the only one of us who &apos;s innocent .
please .
no , i won &apos;t choose . i won &apos;t choose .
i love you all .
there was another family before you
who wouldn &apos;t die for each other ,
so they didn &apos;t deserve a chance at happiness .
no !
fbi . show me your hands .
fbi ! back away from her .
sir , back away . let me help her .
i shot myself .
stand up .
they needed to appreciate what they had .
there &apos;s no blood .
it &apos;s loaded with blanks .
mommy !
arthur rykov ,
you &apos;re under arrest .
there you go .
braden !
you know , there was an automatic weapon hidden in the wall .
rykov could have killed the family anytime .
i doubt if he would have let them go .
&quot; one of the deep secrets of life
is that all that is really worth doing
is what we do for others . &quot;
lewis carroll .
hello , family .
hi .
i would just like to say that i love each and every one of you ,
even you , dr. alex blake .
it &apos;s a new love , but still .
and i am never going to take any of you for granted ever .
ohh . we love you , too , penelope .
thank you . now hug me .
ok .
does this mean we get drinks every time we come home ?
we will discuss it when you hug me .
you &apos;re too sweet , baby girl .
cheers .
cheers .
the director &apos;s been named new head of acquisitions at the museum ,
so that &apos;s why there &apos;s an opening at the gallery--
you &apos;re taking this job .
could you be a little less enthusiastic ?
it &apos;s in new york .
but it &apos;s a great opportunity .
but i probably skipped the step
where you want me to ask you to stay .
ok , mr. profiler , what else am i thinking ?
oh , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking ,
but i think it would be inconsiderate
to not think what was best for you .
but i feel like this is the start of good @-@ bye .
i may get my heart broken .
you &apos;re not gonna get rid of me that easily .
what are you saying ?
new york is a train ride away .
i can be there every chance i have .
you really think we can pull it off ?
sure . why not ?
my 2 : 00 just canceled .
i got a train schedule at my house .
you want to take a look at it ?
i think we have to .
