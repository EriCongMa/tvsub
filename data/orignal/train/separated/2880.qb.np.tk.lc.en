so it seems like this lnternet thing is here to stay , huh ?
it &apos;s okay not to talk .
hey , you guys , guess what.barry and mindy are getting a divorce .
oh , my god .
what is the matter with you ?
no . barry and mindy .
oh , sorry . i hear &quot; divorce , &quot; i immediately go to ross .
who &apos;s barry and mindy ?
barry was the guy that i almost married , and mindy was my best friend .
wasn &apos;t he cheating on you with her ?
but that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .
why did they get divorced ?
well , apparently ... she caught him cheating on her with someone else .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
can you imagine if i &apos;d married him ? how different would my life be ?
i &apos;ve always wondered how different my life would be ... if i &apos;d never gotten divorced .
which time ?
the first time !
imagine if carol hadn &apos;t realized she was a lesbian .
i can &apos;t . i keep seeing it the good way .
i bet i &apos;d still be doing my karate .
towards the end of our marriage , i did a lot of karate to release the tension ...
from not doing anything else physical .
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it &quot; ka @-@ ra @-@ tay . &quot;
what if i was still fat ?
you wouldn &apos;t be dating me , that &apos;s for sure .
sure i would .
come on .
you guys really think i &apos;m that shallow ?
no , i just think monica was that fat .
hey , imagine if i &apos;d never got fired off days of our lives .
hey . hey , there &apos;s carol again .
what if i had had the guts to quit my job ?
i &apos;d probably be writing for the new yorker , being paid to be funny .
but my job &apos;s fun too . i mean , tomorrow ... i don &apos;t have to wear a tie .
what if i &apos;d taken that job at merrill lynch ?
what ?
merrill lynch ?
i had a massage client who worked there ,
and he said i had a knack for stocks .
why didn &apos;t you take the job ?
because at that time , i thought that everything that rhymed was true .
i thought if i worked with stocks ... i &apos;d have to live in a box
and only eat lox and have a pet fox .
yeah , you don &apos;t want that in a broker .
do you guys think if all those things happened , we &apos;d still hang out ?
the one that could have been
oh , my god . rachel green ?
rob tilman !
no , no , it &apos;s me . ross .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . ross tilman .
no . no , no . ross geller .
of course ! monica &apos;s brother .
yeah . right .
wow ! how are you ? good . good . i &apos;m married .
me too !
isn &apos;t it the best ?
oh , it &apos;s the best .
so how &apos;s monica ?
really , really great .
actually , she &apos;s right down the street .
you should stop by and say hi .
i would love to .
she &apos;d be so excited .
okay .
come on .
wait , don &apos;t you have to pay for ...
busty ladies ?
no , that &apos;s okay . some kid asked me to pick it up for him , but i ....
okey
don &apos;t you have to give him his money back ?
here you go , buddy . sorry , no porn for you .
okay , let &apos;s go see monica .
so , monica . still going out with dr. boring , huh ?
he &apos;s not boring . he &apos;s just ...
he &apos;s low @-@ key .
here you go , one hazelnut latte .
thank you .
you know , the hazelnut , actually not a nut.it &apos;s a seed .
can anyone else name a well @-@ known seed that &apos;s been masquerading as a nut ?
oh , dear god . let me think .
what &apos;s the matter ? i got another rejection letter .
they said my writing was funny , just not &quot; archie comic &quot; funny .
i gotta get back to the hospital .
bye . -bye @-@ bye .
by the way , the answer is : the brazil nut .
was his question , &quot; what &apos;s more boring than him ? &quot;
and nice sweater vest , by the way .
stop it , guys . he &apos;s sweet .
yeah , yeah .
hey , man . sorry about the archie thing.you need me to give you some money ?
i may have no money , but i still have my pride .
really ?
joey doesn &apos;t have to give you the money.tv stars have assistants , right ?
that &apos;s an idea .
if i hire an assistant , would you take money from her ?
no , joey . chandler could be your assistant .
he could answer all your fan mail and stuff .
that would be great ! let &apos;s do that ! -i could use the money .
i &apos;d have time to write .
great . welcome aboard !
okay !
all right . now , i need to use the bathroom.since i don &apos;t need any assistance in there ,
take a break ! all right .
hey .
hey , phoebe.guess what .
joey just hired chandler to be his assistant .
that &apos;s so sweet .
oh ! hang on ! hang on !

oh , my god ! joey tribbiani from days of our lives just walked in here !
rach , he &apos;s a friend of ours .
you &apos;re friends with dr. drake ramoray ?
it &apos;s hard to be friends with drake ... because of his busy schedule and the fact that he &apos;s not real .
hey , or i could bring my keyboard here sometime .
he &apos;s coming over . -joey ?
i know . here , here .
no . this is my friend rachel . we went to high school together .
i love you on that show.i watch you every day .
when you took out your own kidney to save your ex @-@ wife ... even though she tried to kill you
it &apos;s always nice to meet fans .
she &apos;s not crazy , is she ?
no .
so how you doing ?
hang on.hang on . hang on .

you realize what you are , don &apos;t you ? -what ?

wait ! you didn &apos;t sit on my kit kats did you ?
no , there was a little , little dip in the market ...
and i lost 13 million dollars .
but the kit kats are all right ?
what am i gonna do ? i can &apos;t call my office , they &apos;ll kill me .
i can &apos;t call my clients , they &apos;ll kill themselves !
great , now my chest hurts .
what ? my chest hurts .
and now i can &apos;t breathe .
are you having a heart attack ?
if i were , would i have shooting pains up and down my left arm ?
yes .
then , yes . that is what i &apos;m having .
oh , my god !
okay , this thing is useless . so will you dial 911 for me ?
come on , phoebe , it &apos;s not that bad .
most people would be excited if they didn &apos;t work for a couple weeks .
most people don &apos;t like their jobs . i love my job .
i &apos;ve been not working for three hours , and i &apos;m already going crazy .
i miss joan .
honey , having a heart attack is nature &apos;s way of telling you to slow down .
i always thought having a heart attack was nature &apos;s way of telling you to die .
you &apos;re not gonna die .
i mean , you are going to die , but you &apos;re not gonna die today .
i wish i was dead .
let &apos;s take a walk .
you should consider writing for talking out of your ass magazine .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
well , i &apos;ve been doing a lot more of my karate .
still a dry spell with carol ?
yeah .
how long has it been since you &apos;ve had sex ?
well , last weekend ...
oh , that &apos;s not so bad .
will be two months ... since i stopped trying .
you need to spice things up.-what do you mean ?
i don &apos;t know.you could tie her up . you could eat stuff off each other .
dirty talk , menage a trois , toys .
role @-@ playing . you &apos;re the warden , she &apos;s the prisoner .
you &apos;re the pirate , she &apos;s the wench .
okay , i think i got it .
or you could be two stockbrokers , and you &apos;re rolling naked on the trading floor ... and everybody &apos;s watching .
it never happened .
sorry .
so how is it going with joey ?
just great . he beeps me now with codes .
one is : &quot; bring me food . &quot;
two is : &quot; i &apos;m with a girl . bring us food . &quot;
three is : &quot; i &apos;m lost and i can &apos;t find food . &quot;
oh , sweetie .
is there any food around here ?
is she gonna be all right ?
yeah , she &apos;s in there .
oh , great .
go take off those pants . they look ready .
and over there is brady &apos;s pub ... where i like to unwind after a long day of &quot; surgeoning . &quot;
this is so amazing . what else ?
well , that is a large piece of television equipment .
and that is an old man.-hey , old man ! -hey .
alrighty . what do you say we head back to my place ?
you know , i would really love to , but i shouldn &apos;t .
why ? why can &apos;t the world stop turning ...
just for a moment , just for us ?
isn &apos;t that a line from the show ?
yeah , but ...
i may have said those things before , but ...
i never truly meant them
until now .
that &apos;s a line from the show too !
okay , you watch too much tv .
here &apos;s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.thanks.
there &apos;s pulp in that .
ya ?
i thought we talked about this .
i don &apos;t like pulp.no pulp . pulp isn &apos;t juice . all juice .
i &apos;m sorry . i guess i just like the pulp .
i &apos;m sorry . i am being so rude .
rachel , would you like a soda or something ?
because chandler will run right out and get it .
yeah , well , sure , iced tea would be great .
iced tea .
okay . anything for you , sir ?
did i not just tell him ?
okay , look , chandler , if this is gonna work ...
you have got to listen .
you &apos;re gonna throw that juice at me , aren &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s not all juice .
so , honey , this morning was fun , huh ? me hopping in on you in the shower there ?
yeah , maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms .
look , carol , i was thinking maybe ... maybe we can spice things up a little .
what do you mean ?
carol , our sex life . it &apos;s just not ..
dad !
hey there , little fella !
why don &apos;t we get some shoes on you , huh ?
why don &apos;t you show dad how you can put your shoes on in your room .
seriously , our sex life .
i was thinking maybe , i don &apos;t know ... we could try some new things , you know , for fun .
like what ?
well , i don &apos;t know .
what if we were to ... tie each other up ?
some people eat stuff off one another .
yeah .
you know , we could try dirty talk .
we could have a threesome .
i love that idea !
who sold a story to archie comics ?
oh , my god , that &apos;s so great .
you &apos;re a published writer . i wish i had a present for you .
wait a minute .
my last kit kat bar .
you want to share it ?
okay !
chandler , i know you &apos;re mad . i &apos;m sorry .
i was a total jerk . completely over the line .
i just ... i hate pulp .
you know how monica feels about low @-@ fat mayonnaise ?
it &apos;s not mayonnaise !
anyway , i just wanted to say i &apos;m sorry , and here .
what &apos;s this ?
fresh @-@ squeezed orange juice , with pulp.just the way you like it .
thanks , man .
hey , joey .
joey ? chandler sold a story to archie comics .
that &apos;s great ! congratulations !
what &apos;s the story ?
you wouldn &apos;t care . it &apos;s just a stupid comic book story .
are you kidding me ? i love archie and the whole gang .
well , archie needs money to fix his jalopy .
but he doesn &apos;t want reggie to just give him the money .
so reggie hires him as his assist ..
as his butler .
and then makes him do crazy things ... like bring him milk shakes that can &apos;t have lumps in them .
wait a minute . that sounds a little familiar .
did they already do that one ? i think i read it !
monica , listen . i have to ask .
okay , joey tribbiani invited me back to his apartment .
does he do this with a lot of girls ?
yeah , a lot . a lot , a lot .
and i &apos;m one of them .
i just cannot believe this . i mean , joey tribbiani .
you don &apos;t have to use his last name .
but , monica , come on , it &apos;s joey tribbiani .
i guess you have to .
it &apos;s none of my business , but aren &apos;t you married ?
yeah .
i wish we could just not be married for a little bit .
you know , i just wish we could be , like , on a break .
well , you &apos;re not .
it &apos;s easy for you . you &apos;re not married . you can have sex with whoever you want .
yeah , i can .
don &apos;t think i don &apos;t . i do.i mean , all the time . you bet !
monica ?
you &apos;ve done it , right ?
of course i have . what do you think , i &apos;m , like , some 30 @-@ year @-@ old virgin ?
oh , my god . you &apos;re a 30 @-@ year @-@ old virgin .
say it louder . the guy in the back didn &apos;t hear you .
yeah , i heard it .
it &apos;s not like i haven &apos;t had the opportunity.i &apos;m just waiting for the perfect guy .
i &apos;m seeing this guy roger .
he &apos;s not perfect ... but
i &apos;m thinking maybe i should get it over with.you know , give him my flower .
oh , my god , do it !
honey , you &apos;ve waited long enough .
you know what ? you are right .
sex doesn &apos;t have to be a big deal .
there shouldn &apos;t be all these rules and restrictions .
people should be able to sleep with whoever they want , whenever ..
rachel , i &apos;m never gonna think it &apos;s okay for you to cheat on your husband .
what do you know , virgin ?
phoebe ? why is smoke coming out of the bathroom ?
the doctor said that could be one of the side effects .
put the cigarette out .
no , it &apos;s not a cigarette . the smoke is coming out of me !
put it out .
okay , okay !
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
come on .
i got it .
give it to me !
i got it .
give it !
hello ?
she can &apos;t come to the phone now .
right . no problem . okay , bye @-@ bye .
was it my work ? were they mad ? was it jack ? did he yell ?
no , just relax . nobody yelled .
jack was making sure you were getting better .
thank god .
yeah , she &apos;s fired .
you &apos;ve done all you can , dr. wesley.you &apos;ve got to let her go .
goodbye and godspeed , hope brady .
not so fast , wesley .
ramoray !
that &apos;s right , wesley.i just stopped by to say that
you &apos;re not a real doctor .
and that woman &apos;s brain is fine .
oh , thank god .
hope ? hope ?
drake ..
you &apos;re not dying , hope
you &apos;re gonna live a long , healthy life . with me.oh , drake .
okay.here we go .
hi , joey ? it &apos;s rachel .
i am free tomorrow night .
yeah , sure , sure , i can bring some sandwiches .
so , honey ... this threesome thing ?
how are we even gonna start to find .. ?
actually , i &apos;m making a list of women i know who might be into this .
boy .
someone &apos;s been doing their homework .
i know gail rosten is in there twice ...
but she is so .... oh , i know .
you know , just talking about it is getting me kind of ...
i know . me too .
i think ben &apos;s asleep .
you know , i think it &apos;ll be better if we just save it .
right . save it . i can do that .
why do you always wear that dumb hat ? what , you late for your paper route ?
&quot; hi , mr. and mrs. jones . here &apos;s your paper .
i &apos;m sorry about your window . &quot;
hey , phoebe .
how &apos;s it going ? i &apos;ve got to get out of this bed . i &apos;m going crazy here ! crazy !
here you go , sweetie .
what the hell is this , herbal tea ? i hate herbal tea .
well , i put some honey in it .
she doesn &apos;t know she was fired ?
no , the doctors say it may kill her .
what are you girls whispering about over there ?
but i think we should tell her .
look , phoebe , maybe this whole heart @-@ attack thing is a sign ...
that you should start thinking about getting a different job .
okay , what is this , a stupid contest ?
because we &apos;ve got a winner here .
he &apos;s right . people are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31 .
i know . but if i didn &apos;t work there , what else would i do ?
you used to like playing the guitar .
that was lucrative . smart like your brother .
what about the massage thing ? that never gave you a heart attack .
pulling in a salary in the high six figures ... or rubbing gross naked people for chump change .
what do i do ? what will i do ?
i mean , it &apos;s just so realistic.i know .
his name &apos;s pat.pat the dog .
i get it !
ready for a refill ?
i probably shouldn &apos;t.so i will !
it &apos;s like it &apos;s raining .
pretty cool , huh ?
but if you think you could put a fish in there and it wouldn &apos;t get sucked into the mechanism , you &apos;d be wrong .
can i use your bathroom ? it &apos;s right through there .
you know , i gotta tell you.if someone told me a week ago
that i would be peeing in joey tribbiani &apos;s apartment ...
life &apos;s pretty great , isn &apos;t it ?
i hope you &apos;re hungry.we &apos;re starting with oysters .
you know what they say about oysters , don &apos;t you ?
they have parasites ?
no
some people say that oysters are an aphrodisiac .
what people ?
people.people say it .
come here .
so , oysters , huh ?
then we &apos;ll have a little middle eastern couscous .
something we can eat ... with our hands .
when we were studying communicable diseases ..
no , no . no .
it &apos;s sensual .
didn &apos;t know . okay .
no
sorry , it &apos;s the hospital .
the food looks great . save me some ?
i can &apos;t promise anything .
we &apos;re really gonna do this ?
looks like it .
if this is too weird for you , you can still back out anytime ..
i got it !
susan
thank you so much for coming .
i wouldn &apos;t have missed it for the world .
i &apos;m ross , by the way .
hello , ross .
i love what you &apos;ve done with this space .
thank you so much .
how hot is this ? !
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re here with me instead of roger .
yeah , me too .
well , i could make it seem like he &apos;s here .
&quot; here &apos;s some little @-@ known facts about couscous :
they didn &apos;t add the second &apos; cous &apos; until 1979 . &quot;
stop it ! that &apos;s not funny !
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? it &apos;s just ...
tonight was supposed to be a big deal .
what was tonight ?
you don &apos;t want to know .
okey
what was tonight ?
tonight was going to be my first time .
with roger ?
not just with roger ? oh , my god .
all right , relax , mr. i &apos;ve @-@ had @-@ sex @-@ four @-@ times !
four different women ! i &apos;ve had sex way more times .
how many ?
nine .
i &apos;m just waiting for the perfect guy .
good for you . you really think that roger &apos;s the perfect guy ?
no , but he &apos;s not a horrible guy .
that &apos;s what i tell girls about me .
chandler , i &apos;m gonna die a virgin !
no , you are not . you are sweet and wonderful ... and this is gonna happen for you .
oh , really ? when ?
do you want to do it with me ? okay .
i was kidding .
so was i.
you &apos;re such an amazing actor .
how do you know where dr. drake ramoray leaves off ... and joey tribbiani begins ?
well , with dr. drake ... they always tell me what to say .
and with joey , i pretty much have to make it up on my own .
tell me something , joey .
i just fell right off the couch there .
yeah , you did .
here you go . let me ask you a question .
when was the last time ... someone told you just how beautiful you are ?
i can &apos;t feel my hands .
come on . come here .
we can &apos;t do this .
oyster ?
if we did do this , there &apos;d be a lot of pressure on me .
because you &apos;ve waited a long time , and i wouldn &apos;t want to disappoint you .
but i have nothing to compare it to .
even if you were horrible , how would i know ?
i do like that .
it &apos;s harder for me . i have four women to compete with .
well , if it helps , there were only three .
so it &apos;d just be for tonight , right ?
absolutely . it would just be one friend helping out another friend .
stop it . we &apos;re not doing this .
let &apos;s do it !
no ! okay !
do you have any moves ?
i have some moves .
i have no moves .
okay , what you doing there ?
i &apos;m sorry , this is just too weird .
yeah , forget it .
what if i turn out the lights ?
chandler ? ya ?
that &apos;s the couch .
i know .
oh , my god !
i know !
i &apos;ll tell you something.we are gonna do that again !
okey
morning .
oh , right .
oh , god.oh , i can &apos;t believe joey tribbiani heard me throw up .
he actually saw you a little bit too .
oh , god , we didn &apos;t ... ?
no no no , not after seeing that .
god , i &apos;m just a horrible person .
wh .. ? why ?
because i &apos;m married .
that &apos;s right , i &apos;m a married woman .
i came to a tv star &apos;s apartment to have an affair .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i &apos;m not a &quot; star . &quot;
i &apos;m just a regular famous actor .
and i &apos;m a horrible , horrible person .
rachel , will you stop saying that ?
hey , look.remember on the show when capri was dying ?
and she gave me ..
the ring from the cave .
oh , my god ! they let you keep that stuff ?
sure . as long as they don &apos;t find out , you can keep whatever you want .
and i want you to have it .
no , i couldn &apos;t .
every time you look at it ... i want you to remember that you are a good person .
now , you had the chance to cheat ... and with me .
but you didn &apos;t . and that &apos;s what this ring stands for .
but i thought that ring stood for capri &apos;s undying love for her brother .
look , you want the ring or not ?
hey , look at you ! you &apos;re up !
i thought i &apos;d try to take a walk .
will you pour me some water ? i &apos;ll be back soon .
you &apos;re not gonna use the pay phone to call work , are you ?
no . i &apos;ve learned my lesson .
let &apos;s go ! come on ! move it !
shoes , briefcase . thanks , lou . good luck with the gallbladder .
hey , joe ... did you ever have a threesome ?
look , ross , i think carol &apos;s great ,
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re very attractive , but
no . the reason i &apos;m asking is that ...
i sort of had one last night .
you ?
all right . so ? was it amazing ? it was ...
okay .
just okay ? did you do it right ?
look , it &apos;s just , did you ever go to a party and think :
&quot; would anyone really miss me if i weren &apos;t here ? &quot;
but still , ross ... your worst day with two women ,
pretty much better than any other day .
it &apos;s just ... my part seemed to be over pretty quickly ...
and then there was a lot of waiting around .
but you got to be with both of them .
not really .
just carol .
not the other one ?
no , she kept kicking me away .
you don &apos;t want that .
at least you got to see a lot of stuff .
oh , i saw a lot of stuff .
you get a little bored ?
a little .
made a snack .
what &apos;d you have ?
just a sandwich .
turkey . a little mustard .
sounds good .
it really was .
let me tell you about this chick i scored with last night .
wait a minute , that was you .
hey , check me out . i &apos;m a slut !
so you want to do something tonight ?
i can &apos;t . dr. roger &apos;s coming over again .
oh , right.because you &apos;re still seeing him ,
and he &apos;s a good guy.i remember a time ....
are you okay ?
yeah , totally.totally. are you ?
great . it &apos;s so amazing.last time dr. roger came over , i was so nervous .
but after being with you , i &apos;m like ,
&quot; can the doctor see me now ? &quot;
i bet he can .
&quot; l don &apos;t have an appointment , but i sure could use a physical . &quot;
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
don &apos;t worry about me , i &apos;ll be fine .
my god ! barry !
you said you were going to be away all weekend !
that &apos;s right ! i &apos;m sorry ! i am early ! finish , please !
surprise ! look who &apos;s back !
phoebe

phoebe , didn &apos;t you get fired ?
i don &apos;t think so .
phoebe ? jack

this clown from research told me i was fired.he should do his research , huh ?
well , you were fired .
no
i told that guy who answered your phone .

anyway , i &apos;ll be in my office .
phoebe , you don &apos;t have an office .
i &apos;ll work right here.this is good . next to this plant .
phoebe
you &apos;re in my office .
i &apos;ve made a lot of cash for this company . i am talking big bucks !
pesos ! yen ! rubles ! you make one little mistake ..
you lost 13 million dollars .
so now this is all about money ?
you know , it &apos;s bad enough that ...
you have got to be kidding .
are you all right ?
i &apos;m having another heart attack .
i &apos;m having another heart attack ! call 911 !
dumb @-@ ass !
phoebe , how &apos;s it going ?
they fired me , and i &apos;m having a heart attack .
well , welcome back .
hi ross ! hi rachel !
is joey tribbiani here ? no
if you see him , please tell him i &apos;m looking for him ...
and that this time i am not gonna throw up !
well , that &apos;s always good news .
are you okay ?
me ? i &apos;m great ! i &apos;m fine ! i &apos;m so good !
but you know who &apos;s not great ? men !
you &apos;re a man , right , ross ?
sit down .
let me ask you something .
do wedding vows mean squat to you people ?
why is it that the second we tell you we are going out of town ...
bam , there you are in bed with the neighbor &apos;s dog @-@ walker ?
we &apos;re sorry .
no , seriously . seriously . what has happened to the sanctity of marriage ?
didn &apos;t you spend last night at joey &apos;s ?
what are you , a detective ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you and your husband ...
and what is hopefully an adult dog @-@ walker .
look , can i just say , not all men are like that .
there are men who &apos;ll do anything to make their marriage work .
men who will stand by and watch ...
as their wives engage in what can only be described as a &quot; twosome ... &quot;
with some woman she barely knows from the gym !
who are these men ?
just men . a guy i know .
well , you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife ... is gay .
she is not ...
she &apos;s gay .
oh , my god .
she is so gay !
i can &apos;t believe this .
good day for married people , huh ?
i &apos;m sorry your husband cheated on you .
i &apos;m sorry your wife is gay .
i guess women aren &apos;t that great either .
try telling my wife that .
okay to come in ?
come in , eat , whatever you want .
dr. roger got beeped again .
yeah , i know . guess who beeped him .
what ? i &apos;m the ruptured spleen .
why would you do that ?
because you shouldn &apos;t be with him .
you should be with me .
really ?
when you were talking about roger , that was killing me .
things like last night , they don &apos;t just happen.at least not to me .
i mean , with the other two women ...
in the morning , i couldn &apos;t wait to go hang out with my friends .
but with you ...
i was , you know , already with a friend .
chandler
you probably don &apos;t want to go out with me.i make too many jokes ,
i &apos;ve never been in a serious relationship ... and i &apos;m not technically a &quot; doctor . &quot;
there was just one woman , wasn &apos;t there ?
no , there were two .
including me ?
oh , yeah .
it only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see
one of them won &apos;t do it but the second will set you free
tell all your hate and anger it &apos;s time to say goodbye
