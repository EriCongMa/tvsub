第七季 第十九集
Welcome to Toronto Pearson International Airport.
Please have your passport and customs form ready.
Hey, it's me.
Hey, it is you.
Where are you?
I-I-I just got in.
I-I need some reassurance here.
I already told you, you're fine.
As of when?
As of last week.
They're all ISIS-obsessed now.
You're old news, buddy.
When's the funeral?
Jeff.
Yeah, what?
When is your mom's funeral?
Oh, tomorrow. Look...
I'm-I'm heading towards Customs.
You're sure?
Am I sure you're off the BOLO list?
Yeah, as of last year.
When did you check it last?
Two weeks ago.
You know, you can just say, "Hey, Jonathan."
This guy... I think he sounds like Dellinger.
Our Dellinger?
He's in Iceland.
I'm, uh, scanning Tyler's calls
and then this guy comes on the line.
What about last week?
I don't work there anymore.
What?
Tyler, I only came here because you said I was old news.
What's the number?
It's a burner.
Tell the systems admin.
‭I just sent you something.
What?
No more goats.
We're done with goats.
It's a monkey riding a goat.
I don't care if it's a goat making a pizza.
This is Station 549, I need the system admin.
Welcome to Toronto Pearson International Airport.
Please have your passport and customs form ready.
Next in line, please.
Welcome to Toronto Pearson International Airport.
Please have your passport
and customs form ready.
Passport, please.
Sir, passport.
I, uh... it's okay, wr-wrong line.
Sir, sir, you need to come with us.
Hey, no, I'm-I'm not going to America, um...
I was in the wrong line.
Excuse me, what's the problem here?
No, I'm not going to America.
I'm staying in Canada.
All right, gentlemen, please, I need you to back away.
I'm sorry, I'm a Peel Regional police officer
and I need to ascertain what this is all about.
And I'm a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer,
and he's in U.S. Preclearance and under our jurisdiction.
Well, no, actually, that's not true.
You're on Canadian soil, you see, so until...
That's easily fixed.
Well, I never gave him my passport!
I never gave him my passport.
No, no, we're not doing...
the middle of the preclearance process.
Relax.
I want my lawyer!
I want to call my lawyer!
Why would I ever get out of bed?
Life?
Your phone has been ringing.
I'm throwing it away.
What?
I need to tell you something.
You killed a man in Reno.
Yeah...
Lucca told you?
Hey, we all make mistakes.
So... I don't want you to get worried
about this because it has nothing to do with you.
What doesn't?
This thing...
that I'm going to tell you.
I was gonna do it anyway.
Okay.
So, that's a bad preamble.
I should have just said it.
Now you're all braced.
Here...
unbrace yourself.
Okay.
You know, we'll talk later, this was stupid.
No, no, no.
What, Alicia?
I'm getting divorced.
Okay, I shouldn't have said anything because
it has nothing to do with you.
I just didn't want you to hear about it
and think that I was...
you know...
No, I don't know.
...expecting something from this.
Makes sense.
Okay.
I just...
That's your phone.
Don't go anywhere, okay?
Alicia Florrick.
What?
Jeff?
Where are you?
Okay.
Okay!
I'm on my way.
No, no... hold on, hold on, this is my call-waiting.
Alicia Florrick.
Eli... your name didn't come up.
I know, I borrowed an intern's phone so you wouldn't ignore me.
Peter is being arrested.
What?
I'm in negotiations with the U.S. Attorney.
I need you to explain to him
why Peter can't be arraigned today.
Anything will do.
Are you serious?
Yes!
The grand jury delivered a true bill.
It just happened.
How long will it take you to get here?
Well, I can't today.
I have to go to Toronto.
You what?!
Why?!
I have a client up there.
I promised him.
Not today.
Okay, it looks like we can hold this off until tomorrow.
When do you get back?
Tonight.
Okay, good.
He is the governor of the state.
He is the corrupt governor of a state who arranged
a mistrial in trade for campaign donations.
Allegedly.
May I remind you this appearance negotiation
is a courtesy my office extends to certain
high profile defendants,
and I can end it at any time.
The governor is being briefed on homeland security tomorrow...
unless you want to be seen as endangering that.
Noon tomorrow-- that's the best I can give you.
At your office,
not the apartment.
Fine.
With no handcuffs.
Handcuffs are not optional.
Not behind his back, do it in front
where he can put a jacket over it.
I am executing an arrest warrant,
not stage managing a TV event.
And we...
are trying to maintain
the dignity of this office,
so the governor does not look like Khalid Mohammed
being dragged out of his apartment in a T-shirt.
Okay.
Agreed.
I don't like Canada.
It's too clean.
I always want to litter here.
Where do we go?
Alicia?
What?
Where do we go?
Are you okay?
Yeah, um, they said
the Peel Regional Police office.
Do you still talk to Jason?
Do I?
Yeah.
He's good, right?
He's fine with things?
Yeah, he likes work,
he likes the consistent money...
or is that what you're asking?
Yeah... yeah.
Cute hats.
This is an airport and not an embassy.
You're on Canadian soil.
Alicia, over here.
He crossed the line into Preclearance.
Which is not an international border.
The United States holds jurisdiction
over its preclearance area.
Jeff, how are you?
Well, that depends.
There seems to be some question
about where my feet stood.
Hi.
Lucca Quinn.
Jeff Dellinger,
a C-list Edward Snowden.
Let's not joke about that, please.
Gentlemen, hello.
I'm Alicia Florrick,
this is Lucca Quinn.
We're representing Mr. Dellinger's interests.
There are no interests.
This is purely a jurisdictional issue.
Then you have no interest in Mr. Dellinger?
Purely an interest in your jurisdiction?
Mr. Dellinger is an American citizen.
He has been traveling abroad.
He had purchased a ticket
to Phoenix, Arizona...
My mom's funeral.
and we have a few questions for him.
That is all.
Would these questions have
anything to do with his recent work
as a National Security Agency contractor?
This is purely
about which country holds sway
over a preclearance area in an international airport.
Diane, hi.
No, Toronto.
Um, I have a quick question.
Who knows the most about international law?
Unfortunately, that was Cary.
Why?
Oh, okay, well...
let me see if I can find anyone.
Hey, um, what about Jason?
Uh, he helped me on a case once.
Did you know he used to be a lawyer?
Yes, I did know that.
Do you want me to have him call you?
No, no, that's okay, I'll call.
I'll talk to you.
Let me guess...
you have to go?
No, not yet.
Not yet means...
20 minutes.
We can do a lot in 20 minutes.
You're dressed.
It's never stopped us before.
Let's talk.
What?
No, I was just-- I-I've never heard
you use those words before.
What's wrong?
All I said was, "Let's talk."
Sit down, this is hard for me.
Oh, my God, what?
Would you wait?
Why is everything suddenly bad?
We've been married now for three years and
I've seen you, maybe, 98 days over that time.
Well, you're at trials.
I mean, I'm... I run a law firm.
That's just who we are.
Diane, I'm selling my business.
I want to move in together...
full-time.
You bastard.
You had me so worried.
I thought you wanted a divorce!
I don't.
Well, did you tell your face?
You can't use
the same expression for everything.
So, do you not want me to move in?
Yeah...
yeah, I think our teeth hit.
Okay.
Okay.
Look, this is what I need,
if you're up for this, too.
I have a buyer for my business
and I need you to review the contracts.
So this is happening?
I have an offer.
Will you review the contracts?
Hey, so you there?
Yes, Canada.
Very clean, I hear.
Um, I'll be back tonight.
I have a quick question.
Shoot.
Can U.S. Customs and Border Protection
detain an American in a Canadian airport?
No.
Wait, with one exception.
How do you know that?
Well, I brought mushrooms back from Winnipeg once,
so I checked.
Well, that's very revealing.
Um... I have someone
in the U.S. Preclearance and Customs area,
one foot in, one foot out.
This is a matter of...
Hey, what do you got?
Alicia Florrick talking trial strategy.
On what?
On Dellinger.
Even if you're just using
Toronto as a hub,
you pass through U.S. Customs in Canada,
not the U.S.
Who's that?
The investigator she's sleeping with.
Shut up, J.
It's the investigator from her firm...
the one she's...
sleeping with.
Now, the only way a preclearance officer
can detain you is if you make
a false or deceptive statement to them.
All right.
Send me the recording.
Don't you think you want me on this, too?
Sorry, J.
How are your tax accountants?
I'll call you later, okay?
We're free to go.
They're bringing in a justice
tomorrow to decide.
Seriously?
They're keeping Dellinger overnight.
I'll stay.
You go home.
Okay, thanks.
My husband, he's...
having issues.
So, you'll turn yourself in tomorrow at noon.
Alicia will come with you.
They will process you
and release you on a signature bond.
I've set a press conference for 2:00.
There'll be no media with the AUSA,
so we'll get the first word.
And that word is "Witch hunt."
That's two words.
I know, I was just going with what Eli was...
Alicia.
Good, good.
Come in.
To my house?
Yes, I'm sorry.
Um, there were cameras outside
the governor's residence.
How was Toronto?
Complicated but clean.
How are you?
Anxious.
Anyone?
Uh, yes, that would be good.
So what do you need from me?
We were just discussing strategy.
What do you think of the
kids joining you at a press conference?
Sure...
When?
You don't mind the kids
being in front of the cameras?
No.
Should I?
It's just,
you've always minded before...
whenever I've asked.
Things have changed. Their dad's in trouble.
I'd rather they didn't do that.
Zach's in college.
Grace is gonna be there soon.
I want them to focus on that.
Okay, we'll work with it,
and we want you there
walking with Peter for the perp walk.
Is Grace home?
No, she's at Jackie's.
Mrs. Florrick, I have a warrant here
for the arrest of Peter Florrick.
He screwed us.
He wants to
embarrass you by dragging
you out in your shirt sleeves.
He's got TV cameras, too.
Mr. Florrick,
you're under arrest.
Governor Florrick, you son of a bitch.
You were just delaying so you could coordinate strategy.
There was no homeland security meeting.
Please cuff the governor.
Please take your hands out of your pockets.
Put your hands where I can see them.
Are you on any prescription medication?
Mrs. Florrick, please step back.
You have the right to remain silent.
‭Do you have any health concerns we should know about?
Anything you say or do can and will be used against you in a...
No, Mrs. Florrick, this is not a photo op.
You will not embarrass my husband.
Thank you.
Hey... we'll handle this.
All right, thank you, that's enough, let's go.
Governor Florrick was arrested last night
on charges of bribery...
Not as bad as it could have been.
We need to ask for a speedy trial.
We need to find out what they have.
I'm hiring an investigator.
Good.
Someone independent.
It can't be anyone from here.
Don't worry.
I have someone in mind.
Good morning, all.
I'm the justice of the peace, Nora Valentine.
Welcome.
The issue, as I understand it,
is about the Preclearance Act of 2001.
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Dellinger crossed the line
into U.S. Preclearance where we detained him
because of a statement that he made...
But they only
detained him after he crossed back across the line.
He did not cross completely back across the line...
He did cross completely back across the line.
...which is why we detained him...
Thank you...
and you all are Americans, is that right?
Well, let's leave
the land of guns and gangs behind us, shall we,
and not interrupt each other.
Also, as I am a
justice of the peace and not a judge,
you should refer to me as Your Worship
and not Your Honor.
Now, I know that
may sound foreign to American ears,
but that's the way we do it here.
Now, then... my understanding...
Do not leave your luggage unattended.
Unattended luggage will be confiscated or destroyed.
Is there any way to turn that off?
No, uh, unfortunately not.
I didn't think you were coming.
Thanks for doing this.
No problem.
Your Honor...
Worship.
Worship?
Your... Worship,
according to the Preclearance Act
of 2001, the country of destination
can detain a passenger
if that passenger has, in some way, lied
to the preclearance officer,
and our client did not lie.
Is that right, Mr....?
Gerald Gallo, Your Worship.
It is not.
If I may, the preclearance officer,
Ms. Ordonez.
I asked Mr. Dellinger
if he ever committed a crime...
and he said no.
She's lying. That's a lie.
Sir...
There was no exchange...
...we will refrain from American-style interruptions.
Given that Mr. Dellinger
lied, the United States is within its rights to detain him.
May we have a moment, Your Hon--
Worship, uh, to... gather a piece of evidence?
You may.
No, don't.
Why?
Are we under surveillance?
I wouldn't take that chance.
Uh-oh.
What?
They're avoiding phones.
Dellinger knows we're here.
I know that-- that's why I said, "Uh-oh."
...released on his own recognizance.
Okay, I looked into it.
Yeah, I saw.
...with his wife Alicia Florrick at his side.
Is this good publicity or bad?
We should call the clients.
My guess is, they won't care
unless Peter Florrick goes down.
Okay, so what did you find?
That your husband shouldn't sell his business,
at least not to PGT Ballistics.
They're offering 60% of its value.
What did you find?
The same.
So, why is he selling his company
for so little?
He may not know,
or he may just want out fast.
Why out fast?
To live his life.
You should talk to him.
Ask him why.
Well, he's a proud man.
He doesn't want his wife
telling him he's undervaluing himself.
Then you should talk to PGT Ballistics.
Tell them to pay more.
This is a witch hunt, pure and simple.
My husband has done nothing wrong.
Hello.
Mr. Crouse, I need you,
again, to investigate.
Investigate what?
This.
I don't think you want me.
I think I do.
When can you start?
Is this coming from the governor?
No...
it's coming from me.
Do me a favor.
Talk to the governor.
If he's all right with it,
then I'm all right with it.
I have a better plan.
I'll talk to the governor,
but you start right now.
I need to know what the prosecutor has
and I'm already behind.
Your Honor, the United States...
Worship.
Your Worship,
the United States objects to the admission of this tape.
It's been authenticated.
Excuse me,
The Canadian authorities gave us this tape.
I objected to the admission
of this tape...
Again, one at a time.
It doesn't look like Mr. Dellinger
said anything before they grabbed him,
therefore he couldn't have lied.
But the angle is... I reject the United States' claim
that they're entitled to custody of Mr. Dellinger.
In that case, Your Worship,
the United States moves for extradition.
On what basis?
There's no outstanding warrants for Mr. Dellinger's arrest.
Actually, there is.
He's wanted for violations
of the Espionage Act.
When was this issued?
Ten minutes ago?
It's a valid warrant,
regardless of when it was issued.
Your Worship, they have obviously
detained my client on a trumped up pretext
to give them time to get a trumped up warrant.
What exactly is Mr. Dellinger accused of?
Attention, Terminal 3 is a nonsmoking terminal.
Designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal.
As an employee of the National Security Agency,
he stole and disseminated classified documents.
That's a lie.
I accidentally took home a-a thumb drive.
That, young man, is a matter for an American court to decide.
In order to extradite, the United States need only
to show sufficient evidence to bring this to trial, which,
I'm afraid, they have.
Do your lawyers have anything
to present before I rule?
We do, Your Worship, uh, but we need time...
to produce a witness.
We've delayed enough already.
Yes, and I'm sure your work at the NSA is very important,
surveilling your country's citizens.
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but I'm not sure I appreciate the tone.
I'm only remarking now as a Canadian citizen.
It would be better if our neighbors from the south
would try to emulate the freedoms we enjoy here,
with no surveillance and with our superior health care system.
Do not leave your luggage unattended.
Unattended luggage will be confiscated.
The judge is leaning towards extradition,
but Dellinger's lawyer, supposedly, has another witness.
Any idea who that might be?
No, and they're avoiding all phones right now.
Do we have any other way to listen?
Any other way to surveil Alicia?
A hot mic, but they aren't even talking
near their phones 'cause...
Dellinger knows our tricks.
No, but here's the thing.
If they do have a witness
swearing to Dellinger's performance, we have a rebuttal.
Who's talking?
The Americans.
NSA, Toronto to Chicago.
What's it about?
Jeff Dellinger.
He's the contractor the Americans lost last year.
I told you they'd be after him.
You didn't tell me anything.
It was obvious.
But what's being discussed?
Trial strategy.
Want us to ignore?
No, keep listening.
Nice suit.
You were expecting sweatpants?
You said this wasn't about the firm.
Peter Florrick.
The Locke mistrial.
Well, I'm sure you read the file.
I read what's public.
I want to know what's not.
Richard Locke murdered his girlfriend,
shot her twice in the chest.
Our theory was that Locke was getting two-timed
and he got jealous.
Defense said it was an accident.
Which was true?
Maybe neither.
But you went to trial.
We had a good case.
We would have gotten the conviction.
If the bullets hadn't gone missing.
How'd that happen?
Some people blame the lead prosecutor;
I blame the crime lab.
They're pretty inept.
So, the lab tech was corrupt.
Probably just sloppy... incompetent.
That must have blindsided you.
We were already at trial.
We turned over our ballistics testing.
Defense requested
the bullets to do their own testing.
But when they couldn't be found...
judge granted a mistrial,
and since jeopardy was already attached...
He couldn't be retried.
Connor Fox is gonna say that Peter ordered someone to lose
those bullets, and it's more likely
that he leaned on the lead prosecutor
than some lab tech.
That I will not say.
Anything else I should know?
Just that people change.
Meaning?
Ah, it's just an observation, I...
I think I know people...
even well.
You talking about someone in particular?
Does Peter Florrick have any reason
to be concerned about you?
Me?
Your testimony?
Only if he has reason
to be concerned about the truth.
So, Cary...
thinks the lab is responsible.
He does.
"Inept," "Incompetent," And "Sloppy"
were the words he used.
What's the difference between inept and incompetent?
About six letters.
That is both correct and accurate.
You may have a problem with Cary.
Why?
He's testifying?
Okay, well...
see if you can get an early look at the discovery;
I'm getting nothing.
Jason, what are you doing here?
He's our investigator.
Jason, would you excuse us for a moment?
We need to put a pin in this.
We need to put a pin in Jason?
You know what I mean.
I have to talk to Peter.
That's what Jason suggested.
Is there something I don't know?
No.
He's worked for us before.
He's still working for Alicia,
and he's preternaturally calm.
Well, I have to talk to Peter.
But I have free rein to hire who I want.
No one has free rein.
Ms. Lockhart,
PGT Ballistics is here.
Uh, yes, send them back.
So, fair market value?
Higher.
Really? How much higher?
$600,000.
Seriously?
Hello, Diane, Mr. Lee.
Are you with PGT Ballistics?
I am PGT Ballistics.
Really?
Oh, the name gives me more gravitas.
Holly Westfall.
So, you're a competitor of Mr. McVeigh's?
More of a friendly competitor.
I was one of Kurt's first students.
His favorite, as he's constantly reminding me.
Would you like me to take care of this, Diane?
No, let's all sit down together.
So... how did you, uh...
hit on the price for the purchase of Kurt's firm?
Holly, is it?
It is. Oh, I like your necklace.
Oh, thank you.
I have one just like it,
but smaller.
Kurt and I were at a gun show in Wisconsin
and we were talking about the generational shifts
in the science.
You know, there's old-school ballistics and new,
and Kurt believes that you can't teach an old dog
new tricks, and I just kept telling him,
"But you're not old."
Hmm. And then he laughed and I just said...
Ms. Westfall, you're very charming, I'm sure,
but unless you can pay 30% more, we're not selling.
Kurt and I had an agreement.
Unfortunately not on paper.
Maybe I should just talk to Kurt.
I'd be happy to arrange a meeting for you to sit down
with both of us, but unless you can increase your offer,
you can go f...
Do you want me to do anything?
Welcome to Toronto Pearson International Airport.
Please have your passport and customs form ready.
Alicia Florrick.
Yes... Tyler?
Yeah.
Oh, you look taller than I thought.
How is Zach doing?
And, Grace, has she picked a college yet?
Yes... uh, have we met before?
No, this is the first time.
You worked with Jeff Dellinger?
For five years, cubicle by cubicle.
And you were working with him, next to him,
when this alleged espionage took place?
I don't know why they call it espionage.
He took home a flash drive... accidentally.
It was classified.
Yeah, but you only classified it after the fact,
after you started scapegoating him.
Mr. Froines, to your knowledge,
did Mr. Dellinger access
classified documents and information
while he worked under you?
He did more that that.
He... downloaded classified material
and leaked it to journalists.
What?!
This is incredible, the story just keeps...
Mr. Dellinger, politeness, please!
Your Worship, the leaking of classified material...
He's lying.
He hates me because I got him fired.
You said you were a former senior advisor at the NSA,
Mr. Froines. Why were you fired?
On suspicion of eavesdropping on my ex-wife.
Did Mr. Dellinger play a role in your firing?
He made the allegations.
Your Worship, may I recall Tyler Hopkins?
He's sitting right over there.
Just ask him a question.
You've maintained your friendship with Jeff Dellinger
since he left the NSA,
and occasionally you two talk on the phone?
Yeah.
I'd like to play one of those phone calls for you now.
Objection!
We have no way of knowing
if this recording is authentic
or if it was legally obtained.
Let's play the recording
and take it one step at a time.
That's how we do things in Canada.
They're gonna kill an American.
Who is?
The military.
They're gonna take out this guy Massoud Tahan.
They convened a panel to convict him.
He's not even a frontline guy.
He's a recruiter.
Mr. Hopkins, that was your voice, wasn't it?
He's not answering that.
You don't need to.
Mr. Hopkins committed a serious security leak
by sharing that information with Mr. Dellinger,
but Mr. Dellinger then committed an even more serious offense
by sending that information
to both the State Department and WikiLeaks.
Your Worship, may I have a moment with my client?
Attention, Terminal 3 is a nonsmoking terminal.
Go ahead, yes!
Designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal.
Is it true?
Did you leak?
People have a right to know what America is doing
in the name of national security.
I was on that panel, Jeff.
Someone else was blamed for what you did
and got fired after 24 years of honorable service.
So don't play the idealist to me.
Designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal.
I was on the panel
that made the decision to kill Massoud Tahan.
Someone else was blamed for that leak,
a Captain Terrence Hicks.
I can neither confirm nor deny.
Well, I can.
Actually, you can't!
You swore confidentiality on that panel.
You shouldn't even be telling me about it.
Well, you can't blame both Captain Hicks and Jeff Dellinger
for the same leak.
I don't.
I only blame Jeff,
and you can't say whatever it is you think you know
unless you'd like to face an espionage charge.
Jason Crouse.
Are you kidding?
He's worked for us before.
He still works for Alicia and he's very... calm.
Find somebody else.
Mr. Governor, if this has anything to do with your...
Eli... find somebody else.
‭We can't be overruling Tascioni.
He needs to work with him, we don't.
Alicia is divorcing me.
You didn't know?
No.
Did you explain to her how that would look?
We're putting it in place now.
We won't activate it until after the trial.
Well, that's good.‭
Yes, I'm... thrilled.
Peter...
I'm sorry.
I truly am.
Thank you.
Attention, Terminal 3 is a nonsmoking terminal.
Designated smoking areas can be found throughout the terminal.
Mr. Hopkins,
how did you come to know about
Massoud Tahan's assassination?
Objection.
This is classified.
He opened the door.
If he wants the recording to come in as evidence,
then I must be allowed to fully cross-examine the witness
on what was discussed.
He can't have his cake and eat it, too.
This is a national security matter!
Everything in America
is a national security matter,
but either you withdraw the recording,
or the NSA's dirty undies get aired here and now.
Now, then...
how did you come to know about the assassination?
We turned her cell phone into a hot mic
that we could contrl remotely without her knowing it.
Whose cell phone?
Hers.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking they've been listening to me for months...
to everything...
to Jason...
but I'm also thinking the judge is on our side now.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking our client is guilty.
We've represented guilty clients before.
Not like this.
He went to WikiLeaks about a military action.
That, to me, is treason.
Is it not to you?
Now, then...
I have thought long and hard about this issue,
and based on what I have heard,
I find there is sufficient evidence
to substantiate the espionage charge;
therefore, Mr. Dellinger's extradition is hereby approved.
Ma'am, we have one more motion to be considered.
We do?
Yes?
Could you live in Canada?
What?
If the alternative is jail,
could you live in Canada?
Uh... yes.
Alicia.
Mrs. Florrick...
you have a motion.
Yes, ma'am, we request asylum.
Are you kidding?!
Jeff Dellinger is a person in need of protection.
He's a traitor,
who leaked classified agency information.
Is there a problem, Your Worship?
No.
No...
I will take this under advisement.
Who is that man?
I... heard Gallo talking earlier.
He's from the CSE.
What's CSE?
The Communications security Establishment.
It's a Canadian version of the NSA.
I think we should talk.
Okay.
I have faults.
I'm, uh...
easily mesmerized by people
who use multi-syllabled words
and, um, men who can discuss Tolstoy.
You never told me that.
Yes, because I don't like my failings...
but in the middle of the night when I review my day,
I know that if a man has quoted Tolstoy to me,
I would be more likely to cut him a break.
I'm disappointed in you.
Yes.
I tell you this so that we can now discuss your failings.
Yes.
You are easily swayed by pretty, young, blonde Republicans.
This is about my sale to PGT.
Yes.
I already shook on it.
Yes, well, that means nothing to me.
You have undervalued your company
by half a million dollars.
I doubt that.
Don't doubt that.
Kurt, this is my plan.
I am going to sell your company
at its appropriate value and then I'm gonna put
$500,000 in a fund for you to use to hire
Republican strippers to your heart's content.
Okay, thanks.
Kurt, you are not gonna sell your company to some blonde...
She is the top ballistics expert in the county.
And she dresses like one.
I have a handshake agreement with her.
I'm honoring it.
Over my dead body.
How are you?
Better than I would have thought.
The Sun-Times says it's a witch hunt.
I know, I, I read that.
And you looked good.
On my perp walk?
The media seems sympathetic.
How's your case going?
Oh, we should get the decision tomorrow.
The justice seems to be on our side.
Oh, just in time for mother's party.
Yeah, just in time.
Connor Fox sent over a plea bargain.
Well, that's a good sign.
What is it?
Three years.
Probation?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I know.
Well, what... what does Tascioni say?
He says they have a case.
Oh, my God.
So we're right back where we started, huh?
I am standing beside my husband again
because I know that he's innocent.
This is the second time...
What makes you think it'll work?
Because Dellinger has something to offer.
What's that?
He knows the ins and outs of the NSA.
He knows how they hot-mic.
So...
So, Dellinger was telling me
about the Canadian CSE...
how the NSA does surveillance on it.
What are they talking about?
Do we do that?
That's one of the reasons
why the NSA is working so hard to get Dellinger back.
They don't want the Canadians to have him.
Call the system admin.
Why?
Because I know what they're doing.
Kim Cattrall?
Canadian.
Tommy Chong?
American.
No, Canadian.
Tommy Chong is not Canadian.
Alberta, Canada, I swear.
Dana Carvey?
That's one of the reasons
why the NSA is working so hard
to get Dellinger back.
They don't want the Canadians to have him.
Ike, get McGuire.
They just mentioned us.
After further reflection, I am granting Mr. Dellinger's
request for asylum here in Canada.
What?!
You got to be kidding me.
I don't understand what just happened. What...
You're a valuable asset.
The Canadians want you for themselves.
Are you serious?
Mr. Dellinger,
might I have a word?
You wanted to talk?
Kurt, I'm sorry.
It's your business, not mine.
You should sell it if you want
to whomever you want for whatever you want.
I'm gonna look for another buyer.
We don't need the money.
You should do what you want.
I am.
I'm gonna look for another buyer.
Why?
Because I love you.
You make me happy, Kurt.
I know.
It's been a while.
I heard Toronto went well.
It did.
You want something to eat?
No.
When I told you I was divorcing,
I didn't mean for it to throw us off.
I know.
But it did throw us off?
What do you want, Alicia?
What do I want?
Yeah.
Why are you getting divorced?
You may have heard,
my husband slept with prostitutes.
That was seven years ago.
Why now?
Because I want to.
Because the kids are leaving home.
Because...
everything.
What do you want, Jason?
I want things simple.
Yes, I know.
So you've said.
Unfortunately, things aren't simple.
I'm not simple.
Nothing's simple.
Okay.
Then what do you want?
You.
