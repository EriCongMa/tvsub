uh , chart , labs ,
uh , security key card
and key to the doctors &apos; lounge .
ooh. oh , look. they used my old picture .
it &apos;s like i never left .
addie , you &apos;re back .
i am not back .
oh , you &apos;re back .
you &apos;re gonna smell the stink and sweat of surgery ,
and you &apos;re gonna be back .
see ? nothing ever changes around here .
things change .
welcome back .
i am not back !
well , i just had no idea
that sunrise yoga would be so intense. told ya .
um , dr . hahn , i have the 3 @-@ d , uh , ultrasounds
and the fetal m. r.i. s for today &apos;s patient .
have you decided who &apos;s gonna scrub in ?
because i diagnosed the mother when she came into
the clinic , so- films .
my first day. my clinical trial .
my baby , all grown up .
you know , nobody cares about your clinical trial
or your sick , sick , terminal patients ,
who &apos;d probably rather be left for dead .
you &apos;re just jealous .
well , yeah. anyone can come up with a clinical trial .
i could come up with a clinical trial. jealous .
not that it would matter ,
cause hahn wouldn &apos;t sign off on it .
you know she won &apos;t even talk to me ?
she always enjoyed talking to me .
really , about what ? her hopes , her dreams ,
then we would braid each other &apos;s hair .
well , at least i &apos;m not living in the clinic .
hey , i like the clinic .
the clinic is my happy place .
will you use your sparkle pager
to get me in on hahn &apos;s surgery today ? oh , cristina ,
i can &apos;t even think about the sparkle pager
because my clinical trial starts today .
sparkle pager stealer !
thank you. okay , the both of you
need to just take a moment and dig down deep ,
and you &apos;ll discover when you do you &apos;re truly happy
for me that i have found path to medical history .
i &apos;m not happy for me. oh , me neither .
his karnofsky score is still 80,
and his c. b.c. and liver enzymes are good .
well , that &apos;s better than expected . i know .
better doesn &apos;t mean good . i don &apos;t want you getting
emotionally involved with these patients .
i don &apos;t want you getting your hopes up .
my hopes are not up .
all right , then , dr . grey , let &apos;s do this .
okay. good. chart please .
come here , you .
wow , it &apos;s great to see you guys. how &apos;s i.a. ?
yeah , it is. oh , it &apos;s great. it &apos;s fun .
you know , it &apos;s the sun and , uh , surfing .
it &apos;s- you surf ?
no , i @-@ i don &apos;t surf , but- oh. you know ?
so anyway , hey , look , i hugged you there .
did you see that i hugged you ?
you stole my husband from me , i hugged you .
i- i &apos;ve grown .
i have , and , i can be happy for the happy couple , right ?
i &apos;m all i.a. and , like- whew @-@ one with myself. mm .

cheers .
happy couple ? see you after rounds .
there she is .
just coming in to check on my patient &apos;s skin flap .
yeah. well , amazing , right ? mm .
i pulled a couple of stem cells from the baby
in utero , six weeks later , i have grown skin ,
like god
nice. what do you say we lock that door
and tear one off for old time &apos;s sake ?
this place is exactly the same .
you are exactly the same .
except now i grow skin for babies ...
like god .
come on . i &apos;m horny. the nurses have shut me down .
thanks for my skin flap .
that a euphemism ?
nope .
i am so coding .
coding hard .
what is that ? is that complaining ?
cause if you &apos;re gonna complain , just do it to my face .
fine. there &apos;s nothing to do down here .
can we please go to the pit or something ?
you &apos;re down here to learn patient care
bedside manner and a whe host of things
you cannot learn in the pit , so suck it up .
hi. dr . stevens .
what seems to be your problem today ?
we , um ... my wife thinks she may be pregnant .
okay , uh , we &apos;ll get you a test- code .
excuse me , won &apos;t you ?
what is wrong with you people ?
and what is that smell ? is that ...
is that scotch ?
it &apos;s seeping out of leo &apos;s pores. you &apos;re hungover ?
you &apos;re all hungover ? don &apos;t blame us. blame o &apos;malley .
george ? he and lexie grey had a party .
george had a party ?
okay , people , you &apos;re about to experience medical history ,
medical greatness , medical majesty .
you &apos;re about to experience
the beginning of something extraordinary .
take in the moment .
okay , dr . grey , did you warn the interns
on what to expect ?
i told them to expect greatness .
yes , in addition to all the greatness ,
the patient may be inappropriately emotional ,
which means he &apos;s aggressive , uh , abusive .
don &apos;t take it personally , okay ? don &apos;t engage .
just realize it &apos;s the tumor talking , okay ?
mr. robinson , mrs . robinson ,
dr. grey and i want to say once again
how grateful we are that you &apos;ve decided to participate
in our clinical trial .
i know it &apos;s a very hard decision to make .
but it is a chance , right ?
it &apos;s , like , our only chance ?
well , if the surgery doesn &apos;t kill me , the tumor will .
what have i got to lose , right ?
as we discussed ,
the treatmt has never been tested on humans before .
we &apos;re going to inject a live virus into the tumor .
and since we can &apos;t we take the tumor out ,
our hope is to reduce the tumor from within .
dr. o &apos;malley. over the past month ,
mr. robinson has experienced worsening vision loss
and increasingly severe headaches .
that in c-
yes ?
nice , huh ?
first thing i noticed about her @-@ hell of an ass .
you like a nice piece of ass , kid ?
admittedly , she could do th a little more on top .
he &apos;s also started picking out new husbands for me .
was anyone talking to you ? !
it &apos;s the tumor talking .
yeah , it &apos;s just the tumor talking .
so you single or what ?
dr. montgomery .
dr. karev. hey .
hey .
we &apos;re hugging ?
yep . i hug now. it &apos;s what i do , so ...
so you &apos;re my guy , huh ?
you think i &apos;d let anyone else in on a case like this ?
uh , i &apos;ll catch up with you in a second .
okay .
you , uh , you don &apos;t own a phone ?
i needed to see you i @-@ in person .
i have a really huge case today .
i wish i could hang out , i really do , but i-
i &apos;m pregnant .
i &apos;m sorry i blurted it , didn &apos;t but i c @-@ lurt it. i
you never have time to talk ,
so i @-@ i kinda had no choice but to blurt .
are you keeping it or are you having an abortion ?
i have a really big case .
ectopia cordis
the baby &apos;s heart is growing outside of its body in utero .
less than 200 cases have ever been reported .
only a handful have survived .
i was on one of these cases ten years ago .
the baby squeezed its own heart in utero and died .
he squeezed his own heart with his tiny , little hands ?
richard , you said there &apos;s a possibility
of a diaphragmatic hernia ?
yeah .
you and i have got a lot of work to do on this little guy .
you up for it ? always .
what about my work ?
i grew an amazing flap of the baby &apos;s own skin .
pretend all you want , but i know you &apos;re impressed .
you are going to ...
what &apos;s up , bro &apos;malley ? you .
o &apos;malley &apos;s in the house .
hey , you paged me ?
o &apos;malley , sup , party dude ?
want to know what i did last night , george ?
i googled recipes . i spent the night with a search engine .
oh , but that was just- it was so spontaneous .
i ... think you &apos;d want to hang out with interns .
code. code .
what is that ?
oh , it &apos;s just something we came @-@ well , he came up with .
he coded .
you coded . you coded .
it was really funny after seven or eight shots .
you coded .
hey. um , so we &apos;re all set for tonight .
tonight ? what &apos;s tonight ?
oh ! um ... the interns , we &apos;re-
we &apos;re just having a little darts tournament thing at joe &apos;s .
oh , my god . i love darts .
do you wanna come ? yeah , absolutely. yay .
ya so coded .
you know , i thought , i don &apos;t know ,
that it would be weird coming back ,
but i gotta say , i find it strangely comforting
that everything is the same here .
okay , in i.a. , people say things ,
but in seattle , there &apos;s this strange culture of wordlessness
wherein i am supposed to suss what one is feeling
by the slight raise of an eyebrow
or the beginnings of a frown .
there y chance yowant to tell me
what &apos;s going on with you , miranda ?
just ... just a lot has changed since you left .
just a lot. oh , come on .
name one thing that has changed in this hospital .
the clinic is actually making money .
the chief &apos;s wife left him. mm @-@ hmm .
derek and meredith broke up and i-
wh , whoa. j- derek and meredith broke up ?
uh , like i said , a lot of things have changed .
nikki jones , 25 @-@ year @-@ old female ,
35 weeks pregnant .
six weeks ago , she was diagnosed with ectopia cordis .
which , as you know , means that your baby &apos;s heart
is currently growing on the outside of his body .
which doesn &apos;t get any less bizarre
the more times i hear it .
not bizarre , baby. just unique .
our son is one of a kind-
wearing his heart on his sleeve .
this surgery is going to take place in two o. r.s.
it &apos;ll @-@ it will work like a dance .
dr. karev and i ll begin with the delivery .
and i &apos;ll stay behind to close your incision , nikki .
while i bring your baby to o. r. two .
where i &apos;ll work on your baby &apos;s heart .
and i &apos;ll attend to your baby &apos;s intestinal problem .
what intestinal problem ? we &apos;ve detected there might be
a slight defect on your baby &apos;s diaphragm .
we just want to be prepared for every contingency .
i just wish i could keep him inside me ,
keep him protected .
he &apos;s protected no matter what , by us ,
by our love .
something about that guy makes me
just want to punch him out .
and yet you didn &apos;t , for which i am grateful , karev .
hippies ...
annoying , huh ?
go away .
hey. how great is she ? she &apos;s great .
did i tell you ? you told me .
did she tell you ? tell me what ?
anything , everything .
does she know you &apos;re divorced ?
you &apos;re divorced ? yeah .
which , as it turns out ...
was the best thing that could &apos;ve happened , really .
no kidding ? are you headed-
yeah. all right , i &apos;ll walk with you .
okay .
all right , well , you know ...
so it seems like there &apos;s been a lot of change ,
even since the last checkup .
his behavior &apos;s been getting more erratic ?
that &apos;s a nice way of putting it .
well , you &apos;ve been incredibly strong , jennifer .
this is ... you &apos;ve been incredibly strong .
you know , if you really want to help , dr. grey ,
you could bring some single men by .
phillip ...
please stop .
jennifer , we &apos;re in a hospital
full of eligible doctors ,
and you &apos;re a waitress with no prospects
who needs to learn how to use her ass to catch a new guy
before i bite the dust !
it &apos;s just the tumor talking .
it &apos;s just a tumor talking .
it is. it &apos;s just the tumor talking .
and he &apos;s laughing again ,
because the idea of me with another man
is just hilarious .
no , no , it &apos;s not . i @-@ i just can &apos;t see .
what ? what can &apos;t you see ?
i- i @-@ anything . i &apos;m blind .
no response to light .
if i remember correctly , you &apos;re a good @-@ looking guy , right ?
just &apos; cause i &apos;m blind doesn &apos;t mean you can ignore me ,
you sick , twisted bastard !
playing games with people &apos;s lives ,
slicing open people &apos;s brains ...
mr. robinson , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry , but i believe it &apos;s possible
the tumor is infiltrating the optic nerve .
we should consider moving the surgery ,
maybe even doing it today .
what about you , dr. grey ?
you &apos;re a sexy little thing .
you think , dr. shepherd here
is attractive enough for my wife ?
jennifer ... this isn &apos;t easy , i know .
my husband is probably gonna die today .
we &apos;re moving up the surgery , and he might die ,
and all he can do is try to fix me up with other men .
and i know , i know it &apos;s the tumor talking ,
but if he dies , my last memory
is going to be of him calling me a piece of ass .
i &apos;m not involved and my hopes are not up .
mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;m having trouble finding a heartbeat on an ultrasound .
that &apos;s what happens , dr. guzman ,
when you &apos;ve had scotch for dinner .
it &apos;s hard to follow the basics .
oh , rebecca .
um , i really didn &apos;t want an ultrasound .
i just wanted to get something for the morning sickness .
it &apos;s really bad .
so you &apos;re pregnant ?
yeah . just like five weeks or so .
uh , yeah , an ultrasound
can be pretty hard to read this early on ,
so let &apos;s just take a blood sample ,
and , uh , make sure everything &apos;s on track .
okay . dr. stevens ...
do you know when dr. karev will be out of surgery ?
i just wanted to say hi .
um , i , uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know that he &apos;s gone in yet .
you broke up with meredith grey ?
well , we &apos;re doing a clinical trial together
if that makes you feel better .
derek , i hugged her- hugged her-
and you &apos;re not even together with her anymore
what the hell happend ?
okay , fine . tell me about the clinical trial .
well , if it doesn &apos;t go well , i &apos;m killing people for sport .
when i walk into an o. r . , i &apos;m an expert .
i can stop a bleed , i can remove a clot . i &apos;m the expert .
but in a clinical trial ... i &apos;m experimenting ,
just groping around in the dark ,
hoping to do the right thing .
she wants greatness from me .
she &apos;s expecting greatness .
okay , seriously , derek , what are you doing ?
i &apos;m seeing somebody else .
she &apos;s lovely .
she &apos;s really lovely .
hey . you came .
yeah. you have to stop paging me .
i can &apos;t deal with this right now . all right ?
i have a really big case today and i just can &apos;t deal with-
i am just as scared
and confused about this as you are .
i &apos;m not scared . i &apos;m just ...
look , y @-@ you don &apos;t want me , okay ?
this @-@ this is not a thing you want me for .
i won &apos;t be good at it . i @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not father material .
i mean ... you have a husband .
he doesn &apos;t have to know that it &apos;s mine , okay ?
no . no , it &apos;s not okay .
alex , i &apos;m just asking you to get over yourself
for one minute and talk to me
so we can figure this thing out ...
together .
i have to go .
i &apos;m gonna be making the incision from here to here , and-
excuse me .
what you said before about further complications-
no , we can &apos;t think like that .
there &apos;s nothing else wrong with him .
our intention is to have a healthy baby .
he &apos;ll be strong and happy and healthy .
don &apos;t you understand what we &apos;re trying to tell you ?
i mean , chances are your baby &apos;s gonna need
a hell of a lot more than just heart surgery .
dr. karev .
chances are he won &apos;t .
you can &apos;t cross your fingers or close your eyes
and hope this will all go away .
dr. karev .
he &apos;s not prepared . i was trying to prepare him .
they &apos;re having a baby ,
and that baby is gonna be all screwed up
because he &apos;s coming into a world
where his parents are unprepared .
they want to talk about loving each other , as if-
as if that has anything to do with having the ability
to raise a baby- a sick baby .
he &apos;s not prepared . i was trying to prepare him .
karev , right now you &apos;re feeling
all your feelings right out in the open .
do me a favor and stuff them back in .
interesting advice .
don &apos;t start with me .
she &apos;s no longer allowed in my apartment ,
so no more tea parties or wine parties
or whatever you two have .
what ? what are you talking about ?
hahn . she &apos;s completely unfair and she refuses to teach me .
okay , i got in at mass gen , i got in at johns hopkins .
i could have gone anywhere , and she won &apos;t teach me !
all right , look , erica- she &apos;s a really good listener .
she &apos;s @-@ she comes off harsh at first ...
uh @-@ huh . but she &apos;s got a really good heart .
so just tell her how you feel , okay ?
tell her how i feel ?
well , i don &apos;t speak girl .
sorry about that .
did i mention i live with yang now ?
what ?
why are you looking at me like that ?
callie ...
are you speaking the ... vagina monologues now ?
what ?
i &apos;m all for it , okay ? i think it &apos;s fantastic .
erica- i mean , she seems great .
i really do like her , actually . i do , and @-@ but are you ?
you want to know
if erica and i are a @-@ a @-@ a couple ?
because i defended her to yang ?
because you seem like a couple , a really happy couple .
um , um ... okay , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s just ...
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s insane is @-@ is @-@ is what it is .
i &apos;m @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i like penis .
i mean , i &apos;m a huge , huge fan of penis .
ha ! hilarious .
you &apos;ve been living in los angeles way too long . i
way too long .
ha ! ha ! hilari @-@ ri
george .
george . george .
hey , listen ...
i am just the messenger , but you should know that people
are prepared to drop out of the tournament tonight .
nobody wants to get drunk and play darts with their boss .
you want me to take back the invitation ?
i &apos;m just the messenger .
what &apos;s that about ?
more special plans with your special friends ?
i would like us to talk today .
i would like us to talk because ... i care
and i , uh , want to know things
and i @-@ i @-@ i have 15 minutes to hear about your feelings .
so ... alex ...
alex , you look thoughtful .
i &apos;m very interested to hear-
i mean , uh , what are your thoughts ?
no . uh , izzie , uh , your thoughts , your feelings ?
honestly ?
uh @-@ huh .
i &apos;m a little worried about my friend alex here
because his jane doe girlfriend keeps showing up
like something out of &quot; fatal attraction . &quot;
her name is rebecca pope ,
and she &apos;s not my girlfriend .
really ?
you guys haven &apos;t ... had sex ...
at all recently ? she &apos;s married , okay ? she has a husband .
well , does it hurt that y- she &apos;s married ?
i mean , does that hurt your- your heart ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
i &apos;m trying to talk girl .
well ... ya coded .
right ?
what ? it &apos;s a new slang . everybody &apos;s saying it .
the way you just said that ,
that was you coding .
whatever .
unlike meredith with her trials and petri dishes ,
and cristina , who has to practice talking
like a human being ...
i actually care about patient care .
i need the sparkle pager .
she &apos;s not giving you the sparkle pager .
well , you know what ? i can &apos;t talk girl .
and i shouldn &apos;t have to talk girl
cause i diagnosed the patient . i need the pager .
you can &apos;t have the sparkle pager .
no , give it to me . give it to me .
anyone , uh , anyone ever think you two were a @-@ a couple ?
no , because we screw boys like whores on tequila .
and then we either try to marry them or drown ourselves .
well , make hahn let me scrub in ,
or i &apos;m making you move out .
what ? you-
desperate times .
i &apos;m sorry that took so long .
congratulations . you &apos;re pregnant .
you &apos;re sure ?
it &apos;s a big day for pregnant ladies .
pregnant ladies everywhere i turn . it &apos;s weird .
so i &apos;m only supposed to give you a couple of these ,
but this is , like , a month &apos;s supply of prenatal vitamins-
samples , they &apos;re free .
no , i ... we need to schedule an abortion .
o- okay .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m so sorry .
i- i don &apos;t mean to intrude ,
but ... you might want to sit with this for a few days
before you make your decision .
there &apos;s no decision to make .
i &apos;m h.i.v. positive ,
and the condom broke .
oh , i @-@ i got tested already ,
and , um , i will again s- in , um , six months ,
but , uh , so far i &apos;m fine .
so ...
please i just @-@ i @-@ i ... i want to get this over with .
is there any chance that we can take care of it today ?
yeah. let me , uh ...
let me see what i can set up .
thank you .
all right .
torres .
hey . uh , do me a- do me a @-@ do me a favor
and , uh , put yang on your surgery .
only if you buy drinks at joe &apos;s tonight .
done .
dr. montgomery , will you do me a favor ?
can you talk to my patient ?
i don &apos;t work here anymore , stevens .
she &apos;s pregnant and h.i.v. positive ,
and she thinks she has to terminate the pregnancy .
she doesn &apos;t .
i know , but she doesn &apos;t ,
and it &apos;s not my area of expertise .
i don &apos;t work here anymore , stevens .
if i worked here , i would be performing
surgery after surgery after surgery .
i might even be back with , uh , my husband ,
who is apparently on the market , and i &apos;m not saying
that i want to get back with my husband .
it &apos;s just that things were simpler with him
than the messy , messy single life i am currently living ,
which was not my point , by the way .
my point was ... that i no longer work here ,
which means you need to pull your face
out of the potato chip trough
and go tend to your patients yourself .
i know , but-
you &apos;re a fighter , stevens . what happened ?
i lost a lot of fights .
well , time to get back up .
go .
be the change you want to see in the world .
did you just quote gandhi to me ?
it &apos;s , uh , time to take her to the o. r .
i &apos;m not an idiot .
we heard you .
it could be bad ,
and there &apos;s always a whole lot of bad to focus on
if you want to .
but there &apos;s hope , too , right ?
there &apos;s always hope , too .
jennifer ?
no , it &apos;s dr. shepherd .
i hate this ...
not being able to see .
i just want to see jennifer .
phillip , this is an extremely risky operation .
you still may have a few weeks to live .
you could spend that time with jennifer .
you don &apos;t have to do this surgery today .
i &apos;m trying to fix jennifer up .
i don &apos;t want to leave her alone .
it &apos;s the one thing about all this i really can &apos;t stand .
i just want her to be all right when i &apos;m gone .
you need to tell her that .
before you go into surgery ,
you need to remember this conversation ,
and you need to tell her that .
hey .
i only have five minutes because we moved a surgery up .
but i did want to come here and say
that obviously , he doesn &apos;t know me at all .
i &apos;m not the one e who &apos;s emotionally involved .
he &apos;s the one who &apos;s emotionally involved .
&quot; he &quot; ?
derek @-@ told me not to get my hopes up .
anybody who knows me
knows i &apos;m not a hopeful person to begin with .
right .
i came up with this clinical trial. it &apos;s my baby .
does he honestly think that i &apos;ve just walked into this thing
with no understaing of how hard it will be ?
seriously. no wonder we didn &apos;t work out .
because he told you not to get your hopes up .
exactly . i gotta go. surgery &apos;s about to start .
the surgery with no hope ?
shut up .
so who &apos;s the new mystery woman that derek &apos;s dating ?
who &apos;s the unlucky mcrebound ?
what ? oh , at the- the whole &quot; mc &quot; thing over now ?
i mean , surely things haven &apos;t changed
that much around here .
addison , the woman standing immediately to your right ,
the one handing you the surgical instruments ...
hey .
hey .
six dates , heavy petting , lots of tongue
good guy .
scalpel ?
we can have the baby ?
you &apos;re saying we can have the baby-
a healthy baby .
with the proper prenatal treatment ,
um , the risks to your baby are substantially reduced .
i haven &apos;t found you an o. b. yet
and i think the process might prove really difficult-
it doesn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;ll figure it out. we can figure anything out .
uh , i can &apos;t believe this. thank you .
no ! no. do not thank her .
i asked you to do one thing .
i- i asked you to schedule an abortion . sarah-
no. she just walks in here and gets your hopes up ,
and that &apos;s not okay .
i was diagnosed at 19,
and i have learned how to deal with it .
but i will not put that onto a baby .
i cannot bring a baby into this world
who could possibly have this disease .
i won &apos;t .
now ... could you please just schedule the abortion ?
and do me a favor. don &apos;t come back .
i &apos;d like a different doctor .
phillip , remember what we talked about ?
jennifer .
jenn ?
jennifer !
i- i don &apos;t want to leave you alone .
i- i want you to meet someone .
i want you to promise me you &apos;ll try .
cause ...
i can &apos;t @-@ i can &apos;t do this thinking i &apos;m leaving you alone .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
maybe i &apos;ll make it .
i- i hope i &apos;ll make it .
just a little bit further .
good. keep him flat .
good .
the placenta looks good .
you okay to close , dr. bailey ? yes .
membrane &apos;s intact .
oh , no .
she &apos;s hemorrhaging .
oh , no. this blood is coming a little bit too fast .
hey , i need another set of hands over here .
the utero isn &apos;t contracting. damnit
where &apos;s montgomery ?
the mom is in distress. they &apos;re still trying to close .
okay , get the baby to hahn. addie knows what she &apos;s doing .
i think i &apos;ve been hiding in the clinic .
yeah ? okay. listen , izzie- i lost the contest .
i couldn &apos;t hack cardio .
i performed c. p.r. on a deer . izzie ...
i think i &apos;ve been hiding. i-
you can &apos;t come play darts with us tonight .
what ? i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t have to say this. you should get this .
get what ? you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re not an intern anymore .
and , you know , i &apos;m not a resident .
and that sucks , but i &apos;m trying to make the best of it .
i &apos;m trying to , you know , i &apos;m trying to stop complaining
and embrace what i have .
and what i have is new friends
who don &apos;t want to get drunk and play darts with their boss .
i &apos;m their boss. yes. yeah. you &apos;re their boss .
you &apos;re in charge , and you should get that .
i gotta do something .
get in here .
i thought i made myself clear .
you did . i didn &apos;t. get in here .
listen and learn .
i knew it. you disapprove .
you &apos;re here to push some kind of agenda , right ?
no. no. listen ... if you want to have an abortion
because you want to have an abortion ,
then that &apos;s between you and whatever god you believe in .
but if you want to have an abortion
because you think that &apos;s what medicine is telling you to do ,
then that &apos;s between you and me .
i was ineffectual . i was unclear .
i &apos;ve been on my heels a little bit lately ,
and i was unclear , so just listen , okay ?
i wasn &apos;t telling you there is some chance
your baby might not be born sick .
i was telling you there is a 98 % chance
your baby could be born perfectly healthy-
a 98 % chance .
there &apos;s a higher chance of your baby being born
with down syndrome
than there is of you passing h. i.v. on to your child .
i don &apos;t ... i just- i @-@ i can &apos;t-
know you gave up on having children a long time ago ,
and i understand that it &apos;s difficult
to readjust your thinking so quickly ,
but , sarah , if you take your meds responsibly ,
there &apos;s no reason
why you can &apos;t have a beautiful , healthy baby .
this is your chance ...
if you want it .
this is your chance to be a mom .
a 98 % chance ?
a 98 % chance .
thank you .

no intestines in there ,
no diaphragmatic hernia ? no anything .
his heart &apos;s in. it &apos;s beating. he &apos;perfect .

you seem sad ... miranda .
we &apos;re not gonna do this .
i can &apos;t share .
i can &apos;t catch up with you . i can &apos;t talk .
cause if i did ,
if i told you tucker moved out ,
if i told you
i haven &apos;t slept alone in 12 years ,
if i told you that my heart hurt so much sometimes ,
i want to rip it from my chest
with my own little hands ...
i would fall apart .
and i don &apos;t have time to fall apart .
and not that i &apos;m not happy to see you @-@ i am-
but i wish that you would go home
so the choice to talk and fall apart
would go away .
i got my hopes up .
yeah , me , too .
dr. shepherd .
yes .
it was a pleasure working with you today .
dr. grey .
i do miss some of this .
i could put the paperwork through tonight .
you could start work tomorrow .

i &apos;d rather hang out with you anyway .
george , i get it .
i don &apos;t have to like it , but i get it .
so go. go &quot; code &quot; or whatever .
you know , whenever anyone , uh ,
says something really funny , and i &apos;m laughing ,
i always look around to see if , uh ,
you think it &apos;s funny , too .
even @-@ even when you &apos;re not there ,
i still look around .
go .
i bet you wish
you &apos;d taken the stairs right about now .
giving birth may be all intense and magical and stuff ,
but the act itself ? it &apos;s not exactly pleasant .
but it &apos;s also a beginning ...
of something incredible ...
i am very , very funny .

you wouldn &apos;t believe what she- wait , wait , wait .
hang on , hang on ... that was some really funny ...

caught in your lip gloss .

yes , it turns out i am. apparently .
yep. any of you ladies want to dance ?

is that your problem ?
you don &apos;t like asian people ?
excuse me ?
why won &apos;t you teach me ?
you &apos;re not without skill , you &apos;re not without talent ...
so stop seeking my approval .
i am not gonna tell you
what a good little girl you are .
it &apos;s not my job ,
and frankly , it doesn &apos;t make you any better at yours .
jeez .
little hard on her , don &apos;t you think ?
i think she reminds me of me .
something true ...
