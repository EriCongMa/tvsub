What a perfect day
for the Massachusetts marathon.
Now, we've got our own race correspondent
ready to tell us all about this 26.2-mile race.
Tom, what's the mood down there?
Oh, there's a tremendous amount of excitement right now.
The -- the streets are packed with spectators on both sides.
You can see, the runners are still kind of loosening up,
getting ready for the race.
I had a chance to talk with the police a short time ago.
They said they expect about 400,000 people
are gonna be lining the race.
They're gonna be watching
as some 38,000 registered runners go by,
so it's gonna be crazy.
It's gonna be a great day.
There's hundreds of thousands of people out here watching.
They all have family and friends that are here,
cheering, supporting them,
expecting them to cross the finish line.
After you've trained, you want to take part in a race like this.
Have you seen Maura?
Janie, there's 400,000 people here.
I said inside the Dirty Robber.
So how'd you get into this marathon?
I thought you had to qualify.
Well, apparently, they don't check the times of people over 75.
Hello, Vanilla --
Hey, 5-0, bro.
What up, Rondo?
You two know each other?
Yeah. I arrested him.
Bogus.
Look... Mm-hmm.
...got me some tips for you.
I heard you need a good C.I.
Go away.
Damn! You looking fine today!
You don't want to go running.
You want to cut out of here with Rondo.
I got something in my pocket will make you feel good.
Oh, yeah?
The ladies love this flavor!
Get out of here.
Go away.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Vanilla, you need any help, you come find Rondo.
Okay, casanova.
All right. Go away, Rondo.
Keep walking.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, really, why are you doing this?
I thought you hated running.
Because I told my friend I would.
Your friend?
Oh, hi! Sorry I'm late.
Still getting used to these.
You didn't tell me we were running as mallard ducks.
Well, I haven't built up my foot muscles,
you know, to the point where I can run barefoot.
We'll chip in and buy you some shoes.
Well, early humans ran very comfortably without shoes.
Research has proven that the barefoot strike pattern
is much less stressful.
You, talking google -- stressful.
Where's your matching outfit?
No, no, no, we're running for a charity --
professionals for underprivileged kids of excellence.
We're a team!
Team "P.U.K.E."?
Yes, that -- that is an unfortunate acronym.
At least you're not a hot dog.
Or a mustard.
Stay out of this.
Look, I said that I would do this
because we said that we wanted to do something together.
But I am not running like lady "Puke" Gaga.
No.
I'm sorry.
I...
I should have realized.
I didn't...I'm sorry.
Holy crap.
You're not gonna cry on me?
No, I'm trying not to.
It's just that my amygdala and my lacrimal gland
have a connection that I can't really control.
Honey, there is no way in hell I am taking this off, all right?
I'm already running 26 miles with a camel toe.
Ohh!
Well, can you at least just take off that baggy tee?
Oh, come on! I'll let you walk up Heartbreak Hill!
Oh, I'm walking heartbreak, okay?
You're gonna have to do better than that.
Okay. Fine.
W-- name it.
The next reddish-brown stain --
you call "blood" before the labs come in.
You want me to lie?
No. I want you to state the obvious.
Hypothetically, based on the crime scene,
I will determine whether it is possible to hypothesize that
a stain is blood.
I'll take that as a yes.
20 bucks says you cramp out by mile 10.
You're on. Bet.
And double or nothing, I run like this.
Okay.
And I have some footskins for you, too.
Don't push it.
Okay. You know, my feet are hurting,
so I think I'm gonna take mine off anyway.
Now, the race has started for elite runners,
but here we go about to start our first wave of amateur runners.
Here's Tom Martin.
You excited?
Ecstatic.
You will be.
Runner's high kicks in around mile 12.
Endorphins are comparable to orgasm.
People are already sweating on me.
And they're off.
Ah, there's a lot of family and friends here.
There's college students that are here.
They brought their little grills, their picnic lunches --
that type of thing.
There's just a tremendous amount of support and enthusiasm
for everyone that's out here taking part in this race.
Oh, your son is running. My daughter is running.
She's a police officer.
Hi, guys. How you doing? We're the Rizzolis.
I'm Angela, and this is Frank.
What's up, bro?
I'm not your brother, "Bro."
All right, lighten up, Frank. Come on.
Jane's running, Frankie's working.
Everybody's having fun.
I mean, we're all families out here.
I'd rather hang out with your mother.
Okay, that's not nice.
It's not a good way to start the day, okay?
Now, these folks are clearly running enthusiasts.
These are not professionals.
And we're gonna see just how enthusiastic they are
when they struggle to the top of newhart and heartbreak hill.
Cramp?
No, a blister. My right heel is killing me.
Too much heel.
Your forefoot should absorb the shock.
Strike, forefoot, toes.
Strike, forefoot, toes.
Strike --
That's enough, jog whisperer.
That's it! Great stride!
Runner down. Really, really down.
I-I repeat -- there's a runner down.
What happened?
He started zigzagging and then he dropped.
Heatstroke maybe?
No, ma'am, don't touch him!
She's a doctor.
This isn't heatstroke. No pulse.
Heart attack?
Blood!
Yep, that's blood.
Absolutely not a reddish-brown stain.
Maura, this doesn't count.
C-come here. Look, look.
I see it.
This was so not in my training seminar.
It's an entrance wound. He was shot.
Shock. He just bit his tongue.
She said he's been shot.
No, no, no.
Help, help!
There is a runner do--
All right, you don't talk
or call or e-mail or text anybody, okay?
It's my duty to alert the authorities.
I am the authorities.
Not mine.
I'm responsible for miles 3 to 5.
Oh. You're a buffalo scout, yeah?
So it's in your honor to be loyal and helpful and obedient?
Hear that? Obedient. Okay?
I want you to go get a stretcher and some oxygen right now.
Why oxygen?
You do anything with that mouth besides breathe
and bad things will happen.
Okay? Go.
Take his pulse.
He's dead.
Maura, help.
What, you want me to pretend he's alive?
No. I'm not gonna be an accessory to lying.
Oops! Sorry.
There goes our crime scene.
I understand there are hundreds of doctors and medical workers
in medical tents throughout the race
to take care of any emergencies.
I guess with 38,000 runners,
You're going to see hundreds of problems, Tom.
Yeah, no doubt, Sam.
And as the race goes on,
chances are we're gonna get more problems and more problems.
Put that right there.
Okay, Maura, help.
No.
We're gonna get the race officials to stop the race,
follow protocol, and we're gonna have a chance in hell
of solving this murder.
Listen to me -- we do have a chance.
He is our evidence.
I don't understand.
What happens when 250,000 people
who are crammed into the city like sardines
find out this guy's been gunned down
and there's a shooter on the loose?
Mass panic.
346 pilgrims were trampled to death
during a ritual at Ramy Al-jamarat
because everybody panicked.
Exactly.
So you've got a ramy "Ala jim jam" right here.
You want that?
No, I don't.
But I don't want anybody else getting gunned down, either.
We can stop that.
But I can guarantee you
a lot of innocent people are gonna get trampled to death
if we don't contain this right now.
Now help me!
Get it! Get it!
Ohh. Get it. Oop!
Homicide. Korsak speaking.
Hey, Korsak, it's me.
You're not even out of breath.
I'm not running.
You've been talking about that marathon for weeks.
You quit already?
Korsak, we got a shooting victim, okay?
White male, 30's, no I.D.
Where are you?
We got him in an E.M.S. vehicle,
but we're not moving.
We're -- we're boxed in around mile 3.
Geez, you put it out on the radio,
press will get wind of it, we'll have a stampede.
No! No, no, no, no. No one knows.
Sorry.
Did you pinch the shooter?
No.
What's the matter?
Get to BRIC.
Fire up every security camera in the city.
We got a shooter in the marathon.
I was about a thousand yards behind the victim
when he went down.
I didn't hear the shot. Nobody did.
Silencer?
Yeah. It has to be.
Terrorist attack?
No, it -- it doesn't fit the profile.
He's not an elite runner,
and -- and the area's too residential.
Yeah, they'd want more bang for the buck --
big crowd, big casualties.
Start or finish line.
Sniper doesn't make sense, either.
I mean, tracking down one amateur runner?
You're guessing.
I'm making a conclusion
based on years of experience and training.
Can you see the entrance wound?
Uh, yeah, looks -- looks like a close-contact wound.
No, I'll verify that when I do my autopsy.
Shh!
We've got people running for at least another four hours.
We can't stop the race.
There is no way to safely evacuate
half a million panicky people.
What?
Remember the 60,000 college kids
who got rambunctious after a Sox Game?
1 dead, 16 injured?
Yeah, and that was with 1,000 riot police.
Korsak, we're not moving.
You're gonna have to work it from there.
Can you get Dr. Isles on board?
Yeah, she's not going anywhere.
I'll run interference with the brass,
buy you some time.
Okay, buddy. Thanks.
Where's the nearest medical tent?
Not far.
Why?
We need some muckety-muck race official.
Um, who's in charge?
Ron Garvey.
But you can't talk to him. He's busy.
He's gonna be a lot busier if he doesn't help us.
Get him.
Get him!
Come in.
Hey, Vince. What's going on?
We got the first homicide
in the history of the Massachusetts marathon --
a shooting.
Oh, no.
We get the shooter?
No. Rizzoli was first on scene with Dr. Isles.
Rizzoli's kept a lid on it.
Good.
She's a pain in the ass, but she's a great cop.
It's a lucky break, having the medical examiner there.
All right.
So we got the Charles Street Bridge closed down.
Mass Avenue Bridge, B.U. Bridge -- all closed.
And every side street from here to Newton.
The city's crammed with people with no way to get out.
If we try to stop this race, we're gonna have mass panic!
Hey, Vince, I got to try to figure a way
to evacuate all these people!
Maybe mobilize other counties, national guard.
You been brass too long, Sean.
It'll take 'em hours,
and even if they get here,
we'll have rioting and looting.
Right now, we just got one homicide.
Okay.
I'll fill in the commissioner and the governor.
You think you can convince a bunch of politicians
to do the right thing?
I'm gonna try.
We're about an hour into the race, Tom.
Any signs of fatigue?
At this point, so far, so good.
We've had a couple of sprains.
Right now we've got some dehydration,
a couple of cases of heatstroke,
but nothing more serious than that.
Although, earlier, we did get a report of a guy down
at mile marker 3 with chest pains,
we -- we haven't heard anything since then, and that's...
Give us some room. Nobody comes in this tent.
I need to know that I can trust you with -- with a situation.
My job is situations.
Anybody want to tell me about this heart attack V.I.P.?
Yeah.
Our heart attack V.I.P. is a gunshot D.O.A.
Right. Okay.
Look, I need to call the governor.
We need to run through our contingency plan.
You have a plan for random shootings?
Okay, so while you guys are figuring that out,
Maura, what do we got?
Help me get his shirt off.
There we go.
All right, well, the bullet must have hit his heart.
Explains why the blood rushed
when I compressed his chest.
Um, can you run his number, please?
I need a name.
And I need a coroner's van.
I got to get this body to a morgue immediately.
Maura, you -- you're gonna have to do this here in the field.
You're kidding, right? This...
This body's evidence.
I...
Maura, we just sent the ambulance
and didn't move.
So you're gonna spend the next six hours
crawling back to the lab while our killer slips away?
I...Come...
Jane.
Okay, sure, Jane. Yes.
Just give me a leatherman and some duct tape,
and I'm all good to go.
Great. I got those both right here.
See? Okay.
So...autopsy table.
And look.
Scrubs.
What else do you need?
How about an ultrasound?
Done. You -- eagle boy.
Can you hack into a computer?
I took one apart in scouts.
Close enough. Come on.
I got to get online with Korsak and Frost.
We got you, Jane. We're plugged in.
Okay, who knows?
I briefed the commander.
All right, is he gonna let me handle here on the ground?
I'll run interference for you. What do you got?
I don't know.
Uh, the vic's name is Damon Ward.
He's 33 years old.
I'm running him.
Guys, look,
we -- we got thousands of witnesses, okay?
Nobody sees a gun, nobody hears a shot,
there's no casings at the scene.
What is this?
Shot alert picked up audibles at 9:00, 9:32,
and 10:00.
That was the starter pistol, Sherlock.
The race starts in heats.
Could it have been a random, stray bullet?
It's happened before.
Dennis Rainea got hit by a stray in 1978.
He ran the last 16 miles of the Grand Valley Marathon
with a bullet lodged in his head.
Of course you would know that.
Guys, look, if the shot alert didn't get a stray or anything,
we could be dealing with a silencer here.
Which would mean a pro --
a sniper up in a window or a rooftop.
If we activate SWAT,
we got another problem, like panic.
I don't think this shot came from a roof.
Jane, come and see.
Take us with you on the computer, if you can, Rizzoli.
Yeah.
Observe the wound track.
The bullet traveled to the ribs,
collapsed the right lung,
pierced the heart, kept going,
embedded itself under the left armpit.
Let me see the wound.
Confirms our theory, Jane.
It's not a sniper or a terrorist.
That is a point-blank kill shot.
Stippling pattern reminds me of the old '80s crack wars.
So, what does that mean?
It means he was shot point-blank while he was moving.
The killer was running in the race.
Frost, we're sending photos of the victim.
We need to know who wanted this guy dead.
We've got an especially strong men's field this year,
led by a couple of runners from Ethiopia, three from Kenya.
They're setting a blistering pace.
We may even see a new record set today. Tom?
Well, actually, Sam, we may.
Keep in mind that the elite runners in this race
want to finish in two hours and five minutes or less.
That means that all of the best runners in this race...
Nothing's leaked to the media.
The governor just got back to me,
and he just got off the phone with your commissioner,
and, uh, they're gonna let you be point on this.
For now.
Maybe I'll vote for him next time.
Here's our victim.
Damon Ward, 33.
Boston-area native all the way through high school.
Lives in New Mexico. W-what was he doing here?
Flew in two days ago to run the marathon.
Some homecoming.
Our vic's a living lawsuit.
Guy don't have fans nowhere.
Ran some shady adjustable mortgage scam,
took people's homes.
Maybe one of them took him out.
Run every name from every lawsuit.
See if anybody he screwed is registered to run this race.
Look, this is all very good news, okay?
We got means, motive, opportunity.
It looks like an old-fashioned murder to me,
so I have a good feeling that we'll find our killer.
Great.
Wow, these are very sophisticated tools.
I don't miss my lab at all.
Is that sarcasm?
I think so.
Well, heads up. This might get messy, people.
Am I free to go, detective?
'cause I don't think this is so good for me.
Massachusetts general laws chapter 27, section 4 states --
Jane!
Yes, Quinn, technically you are free to go.
But I don't know why you would
because you got a hell of a cop eye.
I do?
Better than any nature scout I've ever seen.
Because she doesn't know any.
And -- excuse me --
And if you will stay, all right,
I got a very important job for you.
What is it?
Have a seat.
It requires an explanation.
Yes, ma'am.
Let's not get crazy with the "ma'am," Okay?
I'm not exactly wearing mom jeans here.
Of course, what's so great about this famous race
is just how much fun everyone seems to be having.
Tom, I understand you've talked to a lot of people
who have a loved one in the race.
Now, do they all get to see their runners go by
with this many people there?
Actually, Sam, that's a great question
because a lot of the runners -- I've talked to race officials --
and they say about 1/3 of the 38,000 runners
have a digital chip in their shoe
so that family and friends can actually track their progress
throughout the course of the race.
I mean, it really is amazing.
But there's a lot of ways that people are showing their support,
like this family here
with their lower-tech, hand-painted signs.
Hey, Frank! Get those sausages going.
Those poor boys are starving.
Yeah, well, it looks like I'm the poor boy here.
I just got another work page.
Another 200 banjos down the drain.
I don't want to hear it.
Now, look, all I'm sayin' is --
You're saying -- you're saying you'd rather
have your hand up some pipe than cheer your daughter on?
Well, unless my daughter is now Kenyan, you know,
I haven't seen that much of her.
I haven't seen much of my wife out here, either.
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?
I'm having fun out here with people.
It's the biggest party day of the year.
It's also the biggest toilet day of the year,
Next to thanksgiving.
You worked on thanksgiving.
Come on, you serve the bird at 5:00.
What's the harm, anyway?
Your daughter's not a turkey.
Yeah, well, right now, it looks like I am.
You use your fingers?
Well, she has to.
The tool leaves marks. It changes the evidence.
9 millimeter.
Anything on it?
I can't tell.
It's not exactly a S.E.M. Scope.
And I thought I was negative.
Hand me that baggie.
Yeah.
Okay. I'll get this to Korsak for testing.
I thought you said nobody could get anywhere.
You.
You volunteer at marathons. You run?
Yes, ma'am.
Sir. Uh...detective.
My best time in the 800 is --
Raise your hand. The other hand!
All right, I hereby deputize you specifically
to run this bullet to detective Korsak in the Boston homicide unit
without speaking to anyone.
Got it?
Please go.
What happened here?
Anybody see what happened to this man?
Sir?
Anybody see what happened to him?
Sir, can you hear me?
This is officer Frank Rizzoli.
I'm gonna need an E.M.T. at mile 12.
I got you, Frankie.
I got a runner down.
White male, approximately mid-30s,
no pulse, no sign of injury.
Put it on channel 4.
Copy that.
We need to talk to Jane.
Hey, Rizzoli.
Yeah?
Get over here.
They need you on the computer.
Frankie's calling in from the ground.
Please tell me he's okay.
He's fine.
But another runner just went down at mile 12.
Oh, god. I got to call the governor.
I repeat I got a runner down.
I'm gonna need a little help here.
This is bad.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a little help here.
Hey, I just got off the phone with the commissioner
who just got off the phone with the governor!
Sean...
Don't say a damn word!
You know what the commissioner tells me?
Tells me we got a second shooting.
I got to hear it from him like
I'm standing around with my thumb up my ass?!
I'm sorry, Sean, but -- - No, you'll be sorry
when you're counting pencils in the property room!
What the hell, Vince?
So, what'd you say?
I said something stupid.
I just gave my word that my team will get this done.
You know how far out on a limb I am on this, Vince? Hmm?
Do you have any friggin' idea
what I'm putting on the line for you and Rizzoli?
Yeah, I do. We got this.
You better. Or we'll both be counting pencils.
Uniform brought in this kid.
He's got an evidence bag with a bullet,
and I can't get him to say anything,
and he won't let go of it.
Are you Quinn?
Is that the bullet from the first victim?
How many are there?
Please don't tell detective Rizzoli I talked.
Give me the bullet, kid. You can talk to me.
She said that if I talked to anyone, bad things would happen.
Don't worry. You're safe with me.
I'd rather go home.
Sit down till I say you can go.
Okay.
The only one you talk to is him or me.
You got it?
You know what kind of merit badge you'll get for this, kid?
Open up!
All right, in here.
Okay, put him on the table.
Right there?
Yep.
Okay.
All right, 1, 2, 3.
What in the hell's going on here?
We got two runners murdered, we don't know why,
and we think the killer is running in the race.
A-and you didn't feel the need to tell me this?
I couldn't, okay? I had to keep it off the radios.
Jane, ma and pop are out there in the middle of it.
I know that. There are a lot of mas and pops out there.
All right. Okay, you're right.
So, what do you have?
Nothing solid.
I'll do what I can, okay?
I know.
Just got off the phone with the governor.
He wants to engage the national guard
and shut this thing down.
He can't do that.
You're gonna create panic and multiple casualties.
Look, for all we know,
there is a serial killer loose, a terrorist.
We need to get people off the streets!
Okay, just look.
Okay, both these guys have
the exact same close-contact entrance wounds, okay?
That means same shooter.
Out of all of these people,
our two victims --
wwo white guys about the same age, all right?
There -- there's a connection here.
There's -- there's not some random shooting.
These guys are being targeted.
All right, that is a theory.
We are shutting this thing down.
Look, I need you to man up here, okay?
Or you're gonna have your big disaster -- mass panic.
And then the shooter's gonna slip away in the chaos,
and you're gonna have innocent people trampled to death.
Just give me a little more time,
let me figure out the connection between them.
I will find the killer.
All I can do is
try to advocate for normal operations to continue for now.
Just tell the governor that we got things handled here.
All right. If this thing blows up...
bomb's in your hands.
Wouldn't be the first time.
Wow. Picking a fight with the governor.
You're fearless.
No, I'm not.
Come on, Jane. Maybe we should stop the race.
Maura, we stop this race,
we send a message to thousands of people that we give in to fear.
We don't give in to fear!
Okay, I understand that.
I -- if we do,
then we just end up dying a little bit every day.
Which, metabolically speaking, we do anyway.
Maura! Really?
Come on!
There's Mike! Yay, Mike!
Jane, where are you? Are you close?
Uh, no, ma, I'm not. I-I got a bad cramp, okay?
So you and pop should just go home.
We've been here for hours! Your father's gonna be furious!
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to disappoint you.
Yeah, well, that's disappointing.
What'd she say?
She's not running. She cramped out.
Crapped out? Janie?
No, cramps.
She's not in the race.
Unbelievable.
What are you doing?
I'm packing up.
Why?
Why? Janie's not running. We're out of here.
I don't want to go home.
Well, I can see why, you know?
You're the life of the party.
And, uh, you're the party pooper.
Well, I wasn't exactly getting an invitation,
you know what I mean?
What are you talking about?
What am I talking about?
We've been out here for five hours.
And the only words you said to me was "Fire up the barbecue"
and "Open up some beers."
You know, I feel like I work for you.
If I'm gonna work, I want to go home and get paid for it.
Okay, that's not true.
Sure it is.
You know, you always talk about family and being together.
You know, I'm right here, Angela. I'm right here.
And you're spending the whole day
swapping chicken parm recipes all day.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I...I want to be here with you.
Come here.
Yeah, who could tell?
Oh, my baby.
Can you I.D. The bullet?
Think so.
We got a witness on the second shooting.
Let me talk to him.
Bring him in.
Hey, Vanilla. I was hoping it'd be you, baby!
Damn! Them shorts is slammin'!
Man, what you doing up in here?
Rondo, just tell me what you saw.
Oh, I saw it all.
Dude was running. Next thing you know, he fell out.
I knew that player was shot.
But -- that him?
Wh-- which...?
Did you see who shot him?
I might have missed that part.
Uh, my eyes was fixated on this fine freak
looking all perfect in her running stuff.
But she was no you, but who is, right?
So you saw a hot girl running in shorts.
You're a hero.
Yes, I am.
And every hero needs his hottie.
Get him out of here.
Come on. Let's go.
Jane, the bullet's a 9 millimeter hollow point.
It's a hit man's bullet.
Okay.
Which is why it looks like a grenade went off in their chests.
Grooves on the slug indicate a silencer.
Where'd you learn that?
You.
I pay attention.
Push in more.
See, there are synthetic fibers on the bullet.
Looks like various polymeric resins.
What is that?
Pleather.
Come here.
The gunshot trajectory along with the fibers found on the bullet
suggests that our suspect...
was shooting from here.
That's it.
That's it! The suspect is shooting from a fanny pack.
That explains the pleather.
That explains why nobody saw anything suspicious.
Jane.
Yeah, yeah.
Our two victims went to high school together
right outside Boston.
We got something big.
Both their names just popped up on an old criminal case.
What kind of case?
Don't know. It's sealed.
File's in the courthouse.
Damn it.
A court order will take hours, if we get a judge.
I got an idea.
What, you gonna break in?
Yes, I am.
You in yet?
You mean since you asked 30 seconds ago?
Ah! Here it is --
State of Massachusetts v. Ward and Walker.
Open it.
Good idea, Korsak.
Abracadabra.
Oh. Your way didn't work.
Tell Rizzoli you can't do it.
Jane, our two "victims" raped a 15-year-old girl
back in 1995 -- Samantha Brown.
They did a rape kit and serology.
Where are the results?
Oh, god.
Jane, look at this.
Monsters beat her.
Seems like a solid case.
Oh, man.
They videotaped it.
Why didn't this go to trial?
Because there's a third defendant -- Jim Filmore.
Filmore? The Filmore family -- it's a very wealthy family.
Filmore must have bought off the D.A.
No one ever got access to the rape footage.
You know, part of me
wants to let this shooter finish off this asshole.
Check the marathon database. See if he's running.
Filmore's registered.
So, our third victim is still in this race.
Is Filmore wearing shoe?
No. Only about half of them do
so their families can track them.
Wait -- Uh, he had to qualify, right?
So what if we track him by his time?
He runs a lot, but he's pretty erratic --
7-minute mile in Miami,
10 minutes in New York.
That doesn't really narrow it down.
He could be anywhere from mile 20 to mile 25.5.
25.5?
Well, based on my calculations --
Please tell me later.
W-what about Samantha Brown, the rape victim?
Is she registered in the race?
Not registered.
Got a driver's license, though.
800 Chestnut Hill.
That's two blocks away.
You need backup.
No, it'll take too long. It's...
I got an idea for backup. Come on.
This race has run so smoothly today.
We're getting reports that the number of injuries
is actually lower than last year.
Is that right, Tom?
And, Sam, of course, that's great news,
not only for the city but for the race organizers, as well.
I heard that the worst injury so far is the broken wrists.
And I'm guessing somebody stumbled,
put their hand out to break their fall.
Let's hope, at this point, anyway,
that all of the runners still out there
eventually cross the finish line.
This is not the race I had in mind.
Yeah, me neither.
Yes?
We need to speak to Samantha Brown, please.
You can't. She's dead.
What?
Samantha committed suicide a year ago.
You ask me, she died the day she was raped.
We all did.
I-I've seen the case file.
Why didn't it ever go to trial?
We've been waiting for that answer for 15 years.
Is your husband here?
He's dead of a heart attack.
It's just me and my daughter, Courtney.
Can we take a look around?
We've got nothing to hide.
Excuse me.
Is she here?
This her room? Why is it locked?
I don't know. What are you doing?!
Where's Courtney?
Oh, no. Running... in memory of her sister.
Frost, do a marathon database search
for Courtney Brown.
That's him.
Yeah, that's Filmore.
How the hell we gonna find him in this sea of people?
Oh, god. She's my daughter's age.
It's nothing but a damn tragedy.
I'm looking at a security camera at mile 20.
Mile 21.
Maybe he's making good time.
Dr. Isles calculated he could be all the way to mile 25.5.
There.
Right there.
Damn, Frost, good eye.
Frankie, we got him. Mile 25.
We're two minutes out.
Come on, Rizzoli.
Come on!
All right, Frost, where they at? Talk me in.
Middle of the street, maroon running outfit.
Can you see him?
Not yet.
Wait! Yeah, yeah.
Can you get to him?
Jane, there! About 20 yards ahead.
Is he running alone?
Yeah, I think so.
Not anymore.
That's the shooter, right? The girl?
Yeah. Hope they can get there.
Come on, Rizzoli!
Hey, Jim.
Excuse me?
You're making good time. I almost didn't find you.
Do I know you?
No, but, uh, my sister did.
Samantha Brown?
I don't know who you're talking about.
Sure you do. She was a freshman.
You were a senior.
You remember homecoming?
Where you raped her, along with your two other running buddies.
There!
Watch out!
Come on, Rizzoli!
You're crazy.
That's what you called my sister when they let you walk away!
She didn't get to walk away!
I don't know what you're talking about!
Courtney, don't do it!
Wait! One more!
One more! Just one more!
All right!
Please.
Please!
Easy!
Just let my sister rest in peace!
Murder never brings any peace,
to the living or the dead.
Go ahead. I got her.
No. No!
What happened?
She killed Damon and Ray?
They didn't survive their injuries.
Burn in hell with your sister, you crazy bitch!
Calm down!
Janie.
James Filmore, you are under arrest
for the rape of Samantha Brown.
I guess you know who I am?
Yeah, I know who you are.
And I know what you did.
You gang-raped a 15-year-old girl.
Statute of limitations is up. You can't charge me.
You're too late.
Yeah, you missed one technicality --
You raped Samantha when she was 15.
Statute says 15 years from the time
the victim turns 16.
Statute hasn't run out yet!
Huh?
No.
Come here.
Yeah.
Nobody to pay off this time.
We've got the situation secured. Thanks, guys.
Well, you're one lucky son of a bitch.
You could have told me Rizzoli can run her ass off.
I don't know.
I was kind of looking forward to counting pencils with you.
This is kind of stressful.
Yeah, what a day.
You did good.
You too. Still got your balls.
You mean even though I'm brass?
Yeah. Even though you joined the dark side.
Thanks, Sean.
Hi. Is that the guy you saw?
Could be.
But I know I seen that fine bitch there before.
What did she do?
Well, what do you know? Old Rondo saw something.
Give me 40 bucks.
What for?
For finishing the race.
But you didn't finish the race.
I will.
And I need a loan.
All right.
40 bucks?
Yeah.
All right. There you go.
Thank you.
Hey!
Next time you see something,
you come talk to me, all right?
You mean, I am now your confidential informant, Vanilla?
Great plan.
I'll see ya.
Where you going?
Heartbreak Hill.
Oh, now all that's left is the cleanup.
Big job, Tom.
The race is finally over.
All of the runners have, in some cases,
struggled across the finish line.
But now it's a chance for them, I think,
to grab a bottle of water, put their feet up,
catch their breath.
You know, looking around, it doesn't look that bad,
considering we had hundreds of thousands of people
in the streets of Boston today.
Uh, it was a good day.
It was a great race, and I think it's terrific
that we're able to hold huge events like this today
in American cities.
How's the heel?
It's good.
I think that runner's high is kicking in.
Yeah.
Maybe you should run with Garvey next year.
Are you kidding?
I'm not the one he wants to chase.
You want to race, huh?
Yeah, I want to race.
I was born to run!
Come on, girls!
Come on!
Dad!
You did it!
Great job.
You did it!
Great job. Great job.
