&quot; bad blood &quot;
they &apos;ve installed cameras .
they &apos;re all over the c.c.u.
next they &apos;ll be in the o.r.s , the hallways ,
the on @-@ call rooms .
we &apos;re being spied on , mer .
who knows what evil lurks
behind that electronic eye ?
morning , dr. yang .
现多指极其严密的监视
big brother knows my name .
big brother can see your name tag .
excuse me .
the cameras are not here to spy on you .
they are here to supplement you .
on the other side of the camera is a remote physician ,
an extra set of eyes to help reduce mistakes ,
improve patient care , and maximize physician hours ...
we &apos;ve all heard the buzz words ...
&quot; streamline , optimize ,
integrate , adapt . &quot;
every day someone comes up with a new strategy or tool
or technology to increase our efficiency .
the idea is to make our lives easier .
but the question is , does it ?
and of course , ultimately reduce costly litigation .
so does that answer your questions ?
with disturbing clarity .
all right . let &apos;s move on then .
as you can see , this o.r. has been arranged
with maximum efficiency ,
specifically for o.r. turnover .
now what are the main causes for bottleneck ?
the layout of o.r. supplies ,
equipment , and instruments .
so what we have done here ...
what did we miss ?
o.r.s are sloppy .
there are doctors in the ceilings .
what ? what do--what does that even mean ?
we &apos;d know if you &apos;d just put her stupid tights on her .
i was talking her into it , okay ?
she was getting on board .
um , she &apos;s 2 . at a certain point ,
she doesn &apos;t have to get on board .
she has to be in day care .
so you pick her up and you yank her tights on her .
that &apos;s what you do . and then she cries .
yeah , because you wasted all that time cajoling her ,
so now i have to be the bad cop .
if you just made it clear in the first place
that she has no choice--
because when every second counts ,
you need the most efficient approach .
mm . what she said .
it &apos;s about new hospital procedures ,
and we weren &apos;t invited .
thank god . it looks boring .
don &apos;t you guys get what &apos;s going on ?
yeah , they &apos;re closing the e.r. and streamlining the place .
it sucks , but--
they &apos;re gonna fire us .
why bother teaching us the new protocols
if we &apos;re gonna be gone anyway ?
you &apos;re crazy . it &apos;s not that bad .
is it ?
look at this .
nurses are stockpiling .
the end is coming .
your average time between surgeries
is 37 minutes .
with these new o.r. procedures ,
i &apos;d like to see that cut in half .
thank you , everyone .
closing the e.r. should cut down on time .
we won &apos;t have any patients .
how &apos;s hunt feel about that ?
oh , he says he &apos;s not gonna do anything about it
until it actually happens .
oh , it &apos;s happening .
and he can &apos;t be a trauma surgeon without an e.r.
is he gonna leave town ?
&apos;cause if you go with him , i &apos;m screwed .
i &apos;m kind of depending on your rent check .
when did it make this all about you .
the e.r. is not going to close .
derek has a plan .
where is derek ?
he spent the night with kepner .
it &apos;s gonna work , right ?
of course . see , &apos; cause derm cuts a fellow ,
and then cardio skips the ted conference ,
plastic / ortho shares , uh , lab facilities ,
we &apos;ll get a little bit here , a little bit there .
and we &apos;ll have enough saved to keep the e.r. alive .
oh , they &apos; re gonna be mad about the ted conference .
oh , they &apos;re gonna be pissed about everything ,
but that &apos;s okay . it &apos;s gonna work .
do we have a reply yet ?
uh , no , not yet .
that was the subject line ?
wh @-@ wh @-@ wh , is that bad ?
well , would you open an email that said &quot; proposed budget cuts &quot; ?
主题 预算削减提议
oh , no . did i just kill our proposal ?
no . we &apos;re just gonna have to pitch it in person .
go door to door , which is better anyway .
it &apos;s hard to say no to someone &apos;s face .
oh . no offense , sir .
you have an unusually appealing face , but--
i have to brush my tee .
i know . you do , too . oh .
standardizing an o.r. is one thing ,
but that &apos;s not going to make much difference
if we don &apos;t standardize what happens in the o.r.
to that end , i have brought in dr. darrell nesbaum
to show us how it can be done .
everything will be scanned ...
when did you become such a kiss @-@ ass ?
the last five hospitals whose efficiency she improved
ended up cutting their staff by 30 % .
i &apos;ll learn to rope cattle if it means keeping my job .
well , i &apos;m safe because they can &apos;t fire the pregnant lady .
can they ?
uh , dr. nesbaum , you can take it from here .
of course .
good morning , everybody .
now i have just one question before we begin .
are you ready to rock some hernias ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about .
has she moved yet ?
what do you think ?
is her mom here ?
&apos;cause she &apos;s nicer when her mom &apos;s here .
no , she had to leave for work .
you sure the kid didn &apos;t eat her ?
you guys , stop .
she &apos;s angry . she &apos;s 13 and she had a double hip replacement .
you &apos;d be angry , too .
she &apos;s mean .
like a badger .
she &apos;s three days post @-@ op now . okay ?
if she doesn &apos;t move her hips , we &apos;re looking at clots ,
contractures , poor recovery .
we just have to make her do it for her own good .
oh . look who i &apos;m talking to .
can &apos;t even put a toddler in tights .
gr--well , then you just--
you show me how a bad cop does it .
karev , get in there .
why me ?
we &apos;re attendings . you &apos;re a fellow .
it &apos;s an order .
that &apos;s how a bad cop does it .
dr. hunt , i sent contractors to measure the e.r. space .
yeah , and i told them to get lost .
i know . that &apos;s why we &apos;re talking .
the e.r. is open for one more day .
uh , dr. hunt ,
the e.r. is closing .
i know you don &apos;t want it to ,
but you &apos;re gonna need to let that go .
while we are treating patients ,
i don &apos;t want your workmen in the way .
we are on a tight schedule with the renovation .
i was hoping that you would cooperate .
yeah , well , you &apos;re gonna need to let that go .
well ...
i &apos;d just like to hear you name one thing
that you can put in there that &apos;s more useful than an e.r.
it &apos;s still under review , but--
in the army , the guys at the front get the most saves .
why ? because the closer you are to the moment of injury ,
the better chance you have to help .
that is what an e.r. is .
where are we going ?
roof . medevac &apos;s coming .
uh , i @-@ i @-@ i shouldn &apos;t .
i should hop off now--
emergency medicine is the front line .
we &apos;re the first responder . we &apos;re closest .
it &apos;s the most important thing that a hospital does .
it &apos;s arguably--
so name me one thing
that you would replace it with that matters more .
you &apos;ve made your point .
now if you don &apos;t mind , i have a big day , and i--
40 @-@ year @-@ old male logger versus chain saw .
deep neck laceration affecting most of the major blood vessels
and extending into the chest .
he &apos;s hypotensive and tachycardic .
oh , and his nose is pretty much sliced off .
how &apos;s his airway ?
intact . it was never stridorous .
did not appear to involve the trachea .
oh ! i got it . i got it .
it &apos;s the carotid . i have it .
i got it .
i was closest .
okay , everything appears stable .
let &apos;s redress the nose . page plastics .
right away .
gown me .
work around dr. cahill .
and see who else is available .
i &apos;ll check .
keep holding pressure .
as soon as i find another surgeon ,
i &apos;ll take over and i &apos;ll get you out of there .
no , i got it .
having one person control the carotid
limits his chance of stroking out .
all right . gown her , too .
right away .
start with russell .
you want to do the opener or me ?
well , the numbers are so compelling .
i think i &apos;d start with how much
his department &apos;s cuts will save the hospital .
and then i would--
i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll do the opener .
sorry . i get a little excited about statistics .
not everybody shares that passion .
not everybody .
okay , so you do the talking ,
and i &apos;ll hold up the chart when you give me the signal ?
perfect . oh , damn it .
hunt needs me in the o.r.
you &apos;re gonna have to start without me .
no . p @-@ people don &apos;t like me .
talk from your heart ,
not about the charts or the numbers .
you can do this .
and there you have it .
a technique i have developed through years
of highly focused research .
i eat , sleep , and breathe hernias , folks .
after today , something tells me you will , too .
gross .
dr. nesbaum .
over the years , i &apos;ve developed my own technique
for a hernia repair .
so if it &apos;s all the same to you , i &apos;ll stick to that .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s lovely , but the point here
is to standardize the way seattle grace mercy west approaches the hernia
so every o.r. can be prepped the same way .
it &apos;s quick , clean , efficient .
i suppose .
listen to old man webber ,
&quot; my ways are the best ways .
ooh , it &apos;s drafty in here . somebody bring me a blanket . &quot;
now what do you say to a little friendly competition , hmm ?
the first surgeon who can perform 20 hernia repairs
using my exact tension @-@ free mesh technique
will win bragging rights , the respect of their peers ,
and aha ...
this sweet baby .
oh . i &apos;ve seen those in the gift shop .
they &apos;re not cheap .
i knew it . they &apos;re making us fight to survive .
first prize is a fleece .
second prize is a one @-@ way ticket to the curb .
shall we begin ?
tributes ,
may the odds be ever in your favor .
take &apos; em off .
what ?
well , we gotta get you up and moving .
today &apos;s the day .
maybe tomorrow &apos;s the day .
look , if you don &apos;t get up ,
your hips aren &apos;t gonna heal right .
i don &apos;t care .
i know it &apos;s hard .
but you &apos;re only 13 .
you talk like your whole life is over .
like you even know what my life was .
i know that you were into gymnastics .
i wasn &apos;t &quot; into gymnastics , &quot; stupid .
it was my career .
ever since i was 4 years old ,
it &apos;s all i &apos;ve ever wanted to do .
my mom worked double shifts
so i could be in the gym five hours a day .
more on the weekends .
and i knew that if i worked really hard ,
someday she wouldn &apos;t have to anymore .
i ranked number one
at the future stars nationals last year .
i was going to the rio olympics .
i was next .
when my hips started to hurt ,
i thought that i pulled a muscle ,
so i trained through it .
i &apos;m not next anymore .
i &apos;m nothing . i &apos;m number zero .
hey . no , you &apos;re not .
maybe this part might be over ,
but you got time to do all sorts of things .
they said that if the surgery was successful ,
i might be able to ride a bike ,
&apos;cause that &apos;s as good as having your face on a slurpee cup , right ?
you might understand if ...
you &apos;ve ever been great at something ...
been best at something .
so , yeah , my life is over at 13 .
i get to ride a bike and go to school
and wait to die .
cardio tech to the e.r.
cardio tech to the e.r.
dr. yang , about the i.v. heparin you ordered for room three .
is there a problem ?
no . it &apos;s just dr. richardson insists
i give sub @-@ q enoxaparin .
who the hell is dr. richardson ?
oh , yeah . ignore it .
i tried .
he keeps insisting ,
and it &apos;s really upsetting the patient .
open the pod bay doors , hal .
it &apos;s bob richardson . dr. richardson .
i have a little problem , bob .
i &apos;m here to help .
you &apos;re supposed to be our eyes in the sky , correct ?
yes .
then how about you just do that ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
don &apos;t question my medical decisions .
if i order my intern to give i.v. heparin ,
i want i.v. heparin .
uh , i guess you haven &apos;t read the results
from the synergy trial ,
which showed enoxaparin reduced the need for monitoring .
oh . got a lot of time to read , bob ,
hanging out in your underwear ,
watching your wall of monitors ?
&apos;cause that same trial
found that there was more bleeding ...
dr. yang .
the pit &apos;s calling with a possible cardiac trauma in the field .
five minutes away .
don &apos;t try and be a doctor , bob .
just make sure my idiot interns don &apos;t screw up .
give the i.v. heparin .
don &apos;t butt in .
let &apos;s go .
dr. russell . dr. kepner , trauma .
trauma , of sainted memory .
actually , um , we &apos;re trying to save the department ,
i was wondering if could talk to you about some ideas .
got your e @-@ mail . &quot; proposed budget cuts . &quot;
nice try .
well , i think you &apos;ll see that a 2 % ...
okay , uh , numbers don &apos;t really matter . i , um--
ever been to a ted conference ?
i haven &apos;t .
inspiring .
finest minds of our generation under one roof ,
sharing stories of mind @-@ bending innovation .
that sounds great but--
innovation is what &apos;s gonna save this hospital ...
okay .
not this penny saved , penny earned crap .
okay , but , um--
good to meet you , dr. kepler .
kepner .
this is a mess .
i don &apos;t think we can fix this primarily .
can you check for back bleeding ?
cahill ?
me ?
yeah , you &apos;re holding the clamp .
if you can &apos;t do it , then-
okay .
he doesn &apos;t have any .
okay . which means he has poor collateral flow .
we &apos;re gonna need a shunt .
i can put it in if someone will get me a rummel tourniquet .
thank you .
sorry .
i @-@ i used to do that .
it &apos;s like riding a bike , huh ?
yeah , if the bike &apos;s going 200 miles an hour .
that &apos;s what makes it fun .
yeah , damn right , it does .
so why did you stop in the first place ?
yeah , hunt , i got your page .
you &apos;re worried about a brain bleed ?
yeah , we didn &apos;t get a chance to do the scan .
his carotid blew .
is that kepner ?
cahill .
dr. shepherd , hi .
so instead of telling us how to do our jobs ,
now you &apos;re just doing them ?
that would be more efficient .
no , she was in the right place at the right time .
she probably saved his life .
i got lucky .
lucky for this guy his chain saw slipped today .
tomorrow he &apos;d be dead already .
what do you got ?
skateboarder versus car .
late teens . didn &apos;t have i.d.
the kid was slaloming hills with a buddy .
was nonresponsive in the field .
his last systolic was 70 .
heart rate tacking along in the 130s .
e.k.g. shows some changes , so i suspect cardiac trauma .
okay , i need a portable x @-@ ray up here , stat .
i need a 12 @-@ lead , and , uh , let &apos;s get a t.e.e. bedside .
right away .
ready on three . one , two , three .
murphy , set up the t.e.e.
got it .
type and cross for six units .
hang two units of o @-@ neg as soon as possible .
hey , what &apos;s your buddy &apos;s name ?
um , rich . rich campion .
does he have any allergies that you know of ?
is he on any medications ?
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
look , is he going to be okay ?
we &apos;re doing everything we can .
no breath sounds on the right . someone set up a chest tube .
on it .
it looks like a mediastinal hematoma .
could be an aortic transection .
uh , we need to move fast , people .
b.p. &apos; s still dropping . scissor .
yeah , he &apos;s crashing . where is that blood ?
right here , doctor .
oh , he has a medical i.d. it must have broken off .
okay . what &apos;s it say ? what &apos;s he allergic to ?
oh , god .
what is he allergic to ?
okay , stop .
he &apos;s a jehovah &apos;s witness . we can &apos;t give him blood .
they &apos;re prepping the o.r. for a bloodless surgery
so we &apos;ll need to recirculate his blood .
so we &apos;ll put him on a cell saver machine ,
and then continue the hypertonic saline ,
colloids , and factor vii to pump up his intravascular volume .
we &apos;re seriously repairing an aortic transection
without blood ?
yeah , we have no choice .
we could use blood .
oh , we could also be arrested for assault and battery .
very funny .
i &apos;m not joking .
there are protocols in place for people who won &apos;t
or can &apos;t accept supplemental blood .
we do bloodless surgeries here all the time .
have you ever done this-- a bloodless aortic transection ?
no .
dr. radnor to labor and delivery ...
i @-@ i hear you . i did .
and ...
alex .
you don &apos;t have her walking yet ?
oh , there &apos;s no talking to that girl .
it &apos;s dark in there .
really dark .
karev-
i &apos;m serious .
that girl turned me into a suicide risk .
i &apos;m gonna move her myself then .
mm . excessive force-- bad cop &apos;s go @-@ to move .
you know what makes a bad cop bad ?
when the good cop &apos;s namby @-@ pamby approach gets us nowhere .
then bad cop has to set a limit
and ends up looking like a big meanie .
a good cop &apos;s approach takes time
and patience .
bad cop is a notorious hothead .
if she &apos;s going to insist on wearing dresses ,
she has to wear tights .
i &apos;m gonna go lie down .
his vitals are worse .
how &apos;s the cell saver coming ?
almost ready .
do we have surgical glue ?
yes .
avitene ?
yes .
okay , i want two bovies set up .
i &apos;m on it .
joy , get my headlamp ready .
here it is .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
where is my gel foam and thrombin ?
we &apos;re trying to keep blood loss to a minimum .
we need a whole bunch more .
okay , hypertonic saline ? check .
factor vii ? check .
cell saver ready ?
check .
okay , let &apos;s go before he bleeds out .
i can &apos;t cut . he &apos;ll lose too much blood .
what do we do ?
we &apos;ll go in percutaneously .
get the o.r. ready for an endovascular repair .
let &apos;s move .
excellent , dr. grey .
19 more to go .
you &apos;re gonna choke , grey .
you &apos;ll choke and die , and i will dance and sing .
damn it . damn it !
the mesh is bunching up at the pubic tubercle .
you know , i still feel that you do not--
i understand this can be tricky at first ,
but once you get the hang of it ,
you &apos;ll see why a dozen hospitals around the country
have already adopted this approach ,
and i &apos;ve already had inquiries from a dozen more .
check !
excuse me .
okay . all right . that &apos;s the right idea .
but , um--
but--but what ?
well--
check .
check !
check !
hey , don &apos;t beat around the bush .
tell me what you don &apos;t like ,
&apos;cause it looks perfect to me .
o @-@ okay .
take a look at what dr. grey is doing over here .
you see how she doesn &apos;t rush ,
cut the mesh just right ?
see , now when done properly , the mesh will fit perfectly
and not require extra sutures to hold it ,
thereby reducing the risk of future complications .
so do this over , pay attention to the details ,
and take your time .
i would be happy
to give you some pointers if you &apos;d like .
that bun in the oven may give you job security ,
meredith grey , but it does not make you immune
from a smack in the mouth .
rich is still in surgery .
uh , dr. yang sent me down to talk to his family .
well , how--how &apos;s he doing ?
it &apos;s touch and go .
they &apos;re gonna take him back up to the c.c.u.
is his family here ?
dude , like ...
dozens of them .
lord ...
you know , i swear , we hung out practically every day .
we have the same shift at the skate shop .
and he never once mentioned to me
that he was a jehovah &apos;s witness .
he never talked about it .
i kind of don &apos;t think he is .
well , maybe it was just a personal thing .
maybe , but i mean , if you ...
if you believed in something so hard
that you would die for it ...
would you keep it a secret ?
wouldn &apos;t you at least tell your friends ?
yeah . yeah , i guess .
i should--look , i gotta-- i gotta get out of here .
will you--will you call me when he &apos;s out ?
sure . no problem .
with which we ourselves are being comforted by now .
blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ .
we can &apos;t repair the carotid under tension .
it &apos;ll pull apart .
or clot . it &apos;s tricky .
we can &apos;t use one of these vessels to patch it .
the chain saw chewed everything up pretty good .
i could take a piece of saphenous vein from the leg--
yes . good .
good . go ahead . prep the leg .
all right . scissors and betadine , please .
right away , doctor .
so i hear somebody &apos;s nose came off ?
can i have a headlamp , please ?
almost . take a look .
well , i would if we could find out
where we &apos;re keeping the headlamps these days .
and what should &apos;ve shaved off half a second
has now added five .
thank you .
gauze , please .
oh , sorry . meant to just say &quot; gauze . &quot;
that &quot; please &quot; just cost me a tenth of second .
all right , avery . that &apos;s enough .
chief , you know this is all about
turning over the tables for her .
i mean , i feel like i &apos;m working the dinner shift
at a jumbo burger in here .
dr. avery--
she should just replace us with surgical robots , really .
i mean , that &apos;s essentially what she &apos;s asking us to be .
bless you . you don &apos;t tell us how to run an o.r.
if you don &apos;t actually work in one . that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
you can tell dr. pantsuit hasn &apos;t been in one in years .
until today .
well ...
i can repair this post @-@ op .
so just give me a shout when you &apos;re done .
thank you ...
doctors .
best of luck .
i thought i was gonna be fired .
sorry about that .
oh , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s easier if there &apos;s a bad guy .
my people just care about this place .
i know .
i know you &apos;re all upset , especially you ,
losing your e.r.
but i also know that without me ,
you &apos;d lose this entire hospital .
so if you need to blame me instead of thank me ,
i &apos;m fine with that ,
because i will know who saved it .
i &apos;ve saved a dozen before just like this one ,
and no one thanked me for those either .
let &apos;s add a c.p.k. to his next blood draw .
what was his last hemoglobin ?
4 .
the guy &apos;s on fumes .
try and stimulate blood production
by giving e.p.o.
or we could ... give him blood
and cut out the middle man .
we can also give i.v. iron @-@ dextran .
thanks , bob .
we can give him iron ? how is that logical ?
we can give him the components of blood ,
just not blood ?
we have to respect his wishes .
what wishes ? he can &apos;t tell us anything .
his friend didn &apos;t even know
that he was a jehovah &apos;s witness .
yeah , it &apos;s not the kind of thing
you talk about at the skate park .
i &apos;m just saying , he &apos;s 19 .
how can he even know what he believes ?
when i was 19,
i was a completely different person than i am now .
i wanted to be a radiologist .
wow . i feel like i &apos;m seeing a whole new you .
uh , start his epo .
and keep a close eye on his crit .
right away , doctor .
so you &apos;re fine with this ?
even though he could die , you &apos;re fine with just--
it doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
he had an alert . it was very clear--no blood .
i don &apos;t get to have an opinion about it ,
and neither do you .
so there &apos;s nothing we can do ?
yeah , there is .
we can talk to the family .
good luck .
simmi , i need you to take my hand .
i &apos;m gonna help you sit up .
you &apos;re gonna swing your legs to the side
and you &apos;re gonna stand up .
now .
i don &apos;t give you permission to touch me ...
like , bodily .
i &apos;ll scream .
simmi , if you don &apos;t move , i &apos;m gonna have to say
that you &apos;re acting against medical advice .
we will discharge you , you will go home ,
and you will rot , okay ?
the muscles around your new hips will atrophy ,
and you will probably never walk again .
why do you care ?
because i &apos;m your doctor
and i worked very hard to help you .
wouldn &apos;t it suck if you didn &apos;t help me ?
if you went through all of that training
to become a big doctor ,
you came up with a plan ,
you did my operation , you did it just right ,
just perfect ,
you made me so i could walk again ,
but i didn &apos;t ,
wouldn &apos;t you feel helpless ,
like nothing matters ?
no matter how much you care ,
how hard you try ,
how badly you want something ,
you will never have it ...
because everything is totally out of your control .
feel that ?
couldn &apos;t have done it better myself .
yes !
yes , indeed .
okay , all right , people often ask me
how i can focus so much time on hernias
and maintain this level of excitement .
well , now you see--
perfection is exciting .
hear that , grey ?
i &apos;m perfect .
oh , look at miss slow and steady over there .
can &apos;t even bother to participate .
no , seriously , grey , you okay ?
um , yeah , yeah . i just need to ...
darn it .
something &apos;s wrong .
something &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re right . i got comfortable and flip ,
and the universe is smacking me down for it .
i @-@ i &apos;m not immune . i &apos;m not safe .
wait , wait . grey , stop .
what is going on ?
there--there &apos;s a flutter . i @-@ it &apos;s--it can &apos;t be right .
oh , sweetie . this is not a bad thing .
what ? it &apos;s not ?
oh , no , it &apos;s good .
it &apos;s so good .
your baby &apos;s kicking .
he &apos;s lost a lot of blood .
i &apos;d say more than half his volume .
he &apos;ll make new blood .
it takes about four days to make new blood cells .
he may not have that much time .
what would really help
is a blood transfusion .
no . no blood .
if you &apos;re worried about disease transmission ,
i can assure you that all of our blood
is meticulously screened .
it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t trust your blood .
we just--
we believe that life is a gift from god
and we don &apos;t try to sustain it by taking in blood .
let me be perfectly clear ,
your son &apos;s condition is critical .
without blood , his organs will start shutting down .
and once he starts that spiral ,
there is nothing we can do .
oh , dear god .
we are juggling all kinds of substitute measures ,
but nothing is as good as blood .
as his surgeon , i urge you
to let us give him the best chance we can .
let us give him blood .
we have seen amazing miracles through prayer .
if it &apos;s god &apos;s will ...
so you won &apos;t allow blood ,
even if it &apos;s gonna save his life ?
&apos;cause prayer--
murphy .
we appreciate all you &apos;re doing for our boy .
but your blood wouldn &apos;t save his life .
it would condemn him .
living with it would be so much worse for him
than dying without it .
we understand .
we will do everything in our power
to keep your son alive .
thank you .
colvin said i was insulting him and everyone in his field .
beck said she doesn &apos;t talk to fundraisers
and strenk basically had me agreeing to give him money .
and then russell--
you talked about the numbers ?
no .
april .
i ... didn &apos;t . i mean , just-- a ti--
like barely at all .
we don &apos;t have a lot of time , but i &apos;ll see what i can do .
oh , there &apos;s redmond .
hey , hey , tim .
i saw your little howie today
when i was dropping zola off at day care .
man , he &apos;s cute .
ah , thanks . yeah , he &apos;s a kick .
yeah , zola &apos;s at that age
where she &apos;s just putting everything in her mouth .
yeah , we &apos;re not quite there yet .
oh , just you wait . it &apos;s like , legos , magnets .
really ?
anything that is a choking hazard , they find it .
jeez .
yeah , well , lucky for us ,
the e.r. is right downstairs from the , uh , day care .
yeah , that &apos;s for sure .
wait , isn &apos;t that closing ?
yeah , that &apos;s what i wanted to talk to you about .
dermatology has two fellows .
now if we could just cut one of them ...
maybe we could possibly ...
i hate her .
who ?
my intern .
why ?
look at her , all mopey @-@ faced
just &apos; cause she didn &apos;t get her way .
we were never mopey @-@ faced . we sucked it up .
why aren &apos;t you in your skills lab ?
oh , because the baby kicked .
wouldn &apos;t stop kicking , actually .
jerk .
no , it &apos;s good . it &apos;s great . kicking is a good thing .
maybe i should kick my intern .
maybe my baby &apos;s kicking because it wants a granola bar .
that &apos;s possible .
you want to stop right there .
you tried to give blood instead of fluids ?
he &apos;s not stupid , you know , the eyeball ?
he has eyes .
and a zoom lens .
rich is circling the drain ,
and he doesn &apos;t have to be .
we are giving him everything we have ,
just like the family requested .
yeah , i know . and they &apos;re praying . awesome .
you never administer anything to a patient without my orders .
you think that because you &apos;ve been here all of ,
what , six months , you know everything ?
you know nothing .
i thought that he deserved a chance .
you have passion . i get it .
you still have to do what i say .
i am your boss and i am trying to save this patient &apos;s life .
now get out of here . you &apos;re off my service .
i just--
now .
i &apos;m sorry .
what are you gonna do , get her fired ?
she didn &apos;t do anything .
there &apos;s nothing to tell .
she &apos;s right , you know ?
he &apos;s circling the drain .
yeah , i know .
okay .
ready ?
fingers crossed .
yes .
the sutures will hold .
there will be no bloodbath .
okay , let &apos;s go , doctor .
remove your clamps .
dr. cahill ?
okay .
okay , good .
i @-@ i @-@ i totally wasn &apos;t sure that was gonna work .
i get it . i get it .
but you did great .
i &apos;d never have thought
you &apos;d spent a day outside of an o.r.
oh , thank you very much .
oh , good god . i have to go .
i @-@ i &apos;ve--i &apos;ve lost a whole day .
you &apos;re all right if i--
no , no , we &apos;re not done .
but it &apos;s pretty straightforward--
no , we need to finish debriding .
we need to put in drains , close ,
then you get to tell the family that you saved him .
he &apos;s alive because of you .
and then they get to thank you .
and that &apos;s the best part .
10 @-@ blade , please .
i &apos;m saying , they always cut
the lowest on the totem pole first .
and we &apos;re below that .
i &apos;ve been emptying urine bags all morning .
you gotta stop .
all these cuts , the reconfiguring ,
this is designed to make the hospital run
more efficiently in the future .
so ?
that means cahill
is planning for the hospital to have a future .
if you &apos;re gonna have a hospital ,
there &apos;s one thing you can &apos;t cut .
doctors .
crap . my patient &apos;s coding .
see that ?
we save lives , people .
we are smart , young ,
vital doctors .
you &apos;re right .
if she &apos;s planning for the future ...
we are that future .
oh , you hope .
&apos;cause you can talk all you want
and work hard , hustle ,
you can empty more urine bags than the next guy .
the future , kids ,
is completely out of your control .
jeff .
how &apos;s the research coming ?
save it . your sidekick already made the pitch .
not gonna happen .
oh , come on .
your team can watch the ted talks online .
it &apos;s not about the talks . it &apos;s about the networking .
the real conf--
this isn &apos;t about me .
this is what &apos;s good for the hospital .
everyone can benefit from the e.r. ,
the patients especially .
you know what might open my heart to your cause ?
your parking space .
my space is right next to yours .
uh , it &apos;s not even an advantage .
in fact , you &apos;re 5 feet further from the door .
i don &apos;t want to swap . i want &apos; em both .
i don &apos;t want you dinging my doors .
what ?
i want both spots ,
so i can park in the middle .
how &apos;s your sister , jeff ?
really ?
really ? you &apos;re really gonna go there ?
well , i &apos;ll never forget how grateful you were
when i clipped her aneurysm .
and you said ,
&quot; if there &apos;s anything i can ever do for you ... &quot;
this is just plain bullying .
say good @-@ bye to ted , jeff .
i still want your parking space .
may as well swallow your poison berries now , webber ,
because i am the girl ... who &apos;s on fire .
check .
very good , dr. webber .
oh , let &apos;s just , um ...
i &apos;m--i &apos;m confused . where--where &apos;s the mesh ?
oh , i didn &apos;t use any .
i wanted to give you a look at the webber method ,
so you can see just what you &apos;re missing .
it &apos;s lovely , but--
isn &apos;t it ?
see , when i use the relaxing incision
to oppose the tissue without tension ,
i achieve the same result without the use of mesh .
but this method will no longer be performed
at seattle grace .
the method we learned today is the accepted method
for open primary repairs hospital @-@ wide .
because we &apos;re cogs in an assembly line ,
churning out product over and over ,
standardized across the country .
don &apos;t you think every patient
deserves the same standard of care ?
and how good can that care be
when we see 50 patients in a day ?
what are their names ? who are their families ?
with that kind of volume , who in the hell knows ?
as long as you can slap a sign on the door that says ,
&quot; over ten million served , &quot; who the hell cares ?
you &apos;re missing the point . the patients don &apos;t matter .
what matters is ...
mm . i didn &apos;t ...
obviously , i didn &apos;t mean that . okay ?
we are only concerned about hernias ,
right now , i mean .
see , that-- that is really quite good .
i @-@ in the months to come ,
i think everyone should follow your lead , okay ?
okay . keep it up .
still in v @-@ fib .
how long has it been ?
26 minutes .
push another epi and , uh , charge again to 200 .
charging .
clear .
still nothing .
damn it .
uh ... charge to 200 again .
clear .
okay , i &apos;m calling it .
time of death--6 : 42 .
he didn &apos;t have to die .
all they had to do was let us give him blood .
and he still could &apos;ve died .
the c.c.u. is full of people we pump full of blood ,
and they still die .
people die .
you know , what you did was wrong
in about a hundred different ways .
and i plan on telling you all of them ,
just not right now .
&apos;cause right now , i have to go talk to the family .
hey , show &apos;s over , bob .
you can change the channel .
how &apos;d it go ?
oh , for god sakes .
i mean , s--okay , see , officer hard @-@ ass ?
your approach doesn &apos;t always work either .
you need to get up now .
you need to take a few steps
and remember how it feels .
and i know-- i know how hard this is ,
but you want this , you do .
you don &apos;t know what i want .
no ? okay .
i lost my leg ...
less than a year ago .
and i was scared and in pain
and i thought that i would never be able to do
the things that i like to do anymore .
but i did .
i operated on you .
they send the cripple in to teach me how to live my life .
you can be scared and you can be pissed
and you can lie here like a garden slug
till you die for all i care ,
but you will not , not , become a monster
that takes everyone else down with them .
you will treat people with kindness and respect ,
and you will start with yourself ,
and you will start by standing up .
and you will do so by the time i count to three ,
or i will drag your ass out of this bed .
so one ...
two ...
three . okay . you got it . you got it.you got it .
okay . okay , i got you . i got you .
all right . good . good .
good . good .
take a step .
great .
look at that . you got it .
good .
good job .
all right . look at you .
oh , my ... he &apos;s gonna live ?
thank you .
this is who you really should be thanking .
if it wasn &apos;t for her--
thank you . thank you so much !
god bless you . thank you .
hold the elevator , please !
oh . off to celebrate , are we ?
ah . i get it .
well , change can be rough .
but once you get used to it ,
you &apos;ll never believe you did a hernia repair any other way .
and if i may say ,
that sweatshirt is quite becoming on you .
it &apos;s itchy .
i did forget what a rush it is .
uh , yeah . what , saving someone &apos;s life ?
yeah , it &apos;s not bad .
you know , we could do that again tomorrow if we had an e.r.
we figured it out .
we can save the e.r.
we got each department to make some cuts ,
and i &apos;m gonna have to park in tacoma ,
but it is going to work .
i &apos;m sorry .
you misunderstood .
no amount of budget cutting or shuffling
is gonna save your e.r ,
or your hospital , for that matter .
you &apos;re getting us ready to sell .
what ?
a buyer is going to save your hospital .
i just need to make it presentable .
i &apos;m sorry . wh @-@ what ? it &apos;s--
you &apos;re staging it , like a house .
exactly .
and the e.r. is like the shag carpet .
it &apos;s gotta go .
sorry .
i had a wonderful time today .
to really be efficient ...
you have to eliminate what doesn &apos;t work .
you have to figure out what &apos;s important ...
急诊部关闭 不再接收病人
what are you gonna do ?
you mean right now or ...
or both . whichever .
right now i am going to drink a lot .
that &apos;s all i know .
can i buy the first one ?
yeah .
and hold on tight ...
to the things that matter most .
oh , i felt that .
uh @-@ huh . wait .
