hi , how can i help you ?
and by that , i mean ,
what &apos;s the least i can do to help you ?
i &apos;ll have the burger with the fries .
she &apos;ll have it with the salad .
but i want the fries .
well , you want them , but you don &apos;t need them .
fine , the salad .
i have to pee .
hi , what &apos;s your name ?
david .
david , you should go .
i &apos;m sorry ?
you want her to have salad , she wants you to have hair .
neither one &apos;s gonna happen tonight .
yeah , it &apos;s not gonna work out between you and french fries .
oh , maybe it will for a week or a year .
depends if she was molested as a kid .
but one of these days , she &apos;s coming after you .
probably in the dark , probably with a knife .
and she &apos;s gonna cut off one or both of your balls .
and you won &apos;t think a side of fries matters
when you have zero balls .
she &apos;ll have the fries .
yes , she will .
look at us .
we saved another woman &apos;s dignity
and another man &apos;s balls .
yeah , we &apos;re like dr. phil but more qualified .

in korea , your heads would be on sticks
outside the samsung factory ,
and you would still have to work .
there is no coffee prepped for your shift .
f.y.i. , tiny dancer ,
prepping coffee is that lazy @-@ ass day waiter &apos;s job ,
so don &apos;t blame us .
it &apos;s not our fault you hired an incompetent waitstaff .
hurry up . you two need to make coffee .
and you need to hire a new day waiter .

how about a brand @-@ new coffeemaker ?
one that isn &apos;t from an edward hopper painting .
以描绘寂寥的美国当代生活风景闻名

unless you &apos;re comfortable with that .
no , i meant the new day waiter .

what happened to the guy we told you to fire ?
we loved him .
okay , we &apos;ll go train the new guy now .
but about that coffeemaker ,

i &apos;m caroline .
well , nice to meet you , but we won &apos;t be friends .
i don &apos;t get attached .
all my life , i &apos;ve been a waiter , 27 years .
i &apos;ve been a waiter 27 years too ,
and i &apos;m only 26 .
and i don &apos;t get personal ,
so don &apos;t ask me how old i am .
i am 53 .
but my face is 5 .
you look amazing .
i &apos;ve only been waiting tables two years .
my main focus is our cupcake business .
we just opened a walk @-@ up window--
honey , honey , i don &apos;t need to know your life .
you don &apos;t need to know mine .
did my father put a gun in his mouth
at my seventh birthday party ?
yes , but i don &apos;t bring that to work .
and i &apos;m in love with you .
don &apos;t do that .
don &apos;t fall in love with me .
you know those gays that don &apos;t like women ?
i &apos;m one of them .
is that the theme song from sex and the city ?
you know it is .
i &apos;m a charlotte .
so am i !
there &apos;s not a lot of us .
i &apos;m all the dead girls from american horror story .
well , let &apos;s get this train on the tracks .
follow me , charlotte .
i &apos;m not giving up on our cappuccino machine .
i &apos;m gonna work han hard until he gives it to me .
yes , i just heard how that sounded .
okay , luis , here &apos;s how the tables work .
we got the four @-@ tops . we got the two @-@ tops .
are you a top ?
oh , please .
no one is pushing this $ 25,000 face into a pillow .
i &apos;m ready to order .
luis , why don &apos;t you take that table ?
it &apos;s part of your training , and i don &apos;t want to .
earl , that &apos;s the new day waiter .
he &apos;s also the new gay waiter .
oh , i love the gays .
they turned an old crack house in my neighborhood
into a cheese shop .
i heard that cheese shop has really good crack .
what &apos;s the soup of the day ?
what does it say on the board ?
and you &apos;re trained .
max , han said no ,
and we need that cappuccino maker for our shop
if we &apos;re ever gonna compete with the starbucks around the corner
or the other corner or the other corner .
or the one that &apos;s currently being built in my ass .
what ? it &apos;s prime real estate .
everything else in williamsburg is taken .
caroline , you need a cappuccino machine ?
i can get you one cheap . i know a guy .
and if you need clean urine or a micro pig ,
i also know that guy .
oh , my god . who was that ?
oh , that &apos;s-- that &apos;s oleg .
he &apos;s the cook .
he is gorgeous .
i &apos;m so excited .
our new machine will be here any minute .
our lives are about to get a lot more cappuccino @-@ y .
or should i say a latte more cappuccino @-@ y ?
no , you should not say any of that .
and as for that &quot; special price &quot; oleg said he &apos;d give us ?
in all my three @-@ ways ,
i &apos;m up to bat first , and i don &apos;t kiss .
during the day , it is hot in herrr .
thanks for the weather report , ursher .
here it is .
shut the windows and shut up .
well , this is starting exactly like i imagined .
shut it !
oleg , where did you get this ?
shut up !
are those sirens ?
shut up !
does it come with instructions ?
the instructions are to shut up .
we don &apos;t want it if it &apos;s stolen .
i still feel guilty about shaking down that redbox
for i don &apos;t know how she does it .
i did not steal it .
i knowingly bought it from a man who stole it ,
and i &apos;m selling it at a profit .
it &apos;s the armenian way .
you &apos;re not armenian .
i know , i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s the armenian way .
it retails for $ 600,
but i &apos;ll give it to you for free
if you do me a favor .
free ?
okay , i guess max can do you
in that closet over there .
what ?
now that i see it , i have to have it .
all right , i &apos;ve been saving this pill for something .
talk to sophie .
see if she wants to get back together .
but don &apos;t tell her i &apos;m interested .
do it discreetly .
deal .
and , oleg , i &apos;m touched and a little surprised .
i didn &apos;t know you knew the word &quot; discreetly &quot;
oh , yeah . i have a word @-@ a @-@ day calendar near my bed ,
next to my big pump jar of pineapple lube .
for when you &apos;re horny and hungry .
max , why &apos;d you take it ?
you don &apos;t have to have sex with him .
i know , i &apos;m celebrating .
hey , i can &apos;t find any of the instructions on here
for our coffeemaker .
in fairness , i haven &apos;t been looking .
i got sidetracked by this buzzfeed list
of misspelled tattoos .
this girl got &quot; you go grill &quot; on her neck .
she must really like to cook outside .
did you put yourself in a time @-@ out ?
no , i &apos;m looking for sophie .
she &apos;s not upstairs .
look , this is a long way to go
to get something for free .
i was happy to walk into sears
and stuff a cappuccino machine down my pants .
i &apos;m not doing it for the free cappuccino machine .
i &apos;m doing it for the money we &apos;ll make
from the free cappuccino machine
and maybe to help oleg and sophie get back together .
you know , it &apos;s a page out of shakespeare , and i &apos;m puck .
书中的仙王仙后曾让小精灵帕克为有情人牵线
puck from the real world ?
am i the only one who &apos;s read a book ?
oh , here she is . i &apos;ll do the talking .
it &apos;s kind of in my wheelhouse .
you have a wheelhouse ,
直译也有房子的意思
and we &apos;re living in this dump ?
morning , sophie .
you caught me .
i &apos;m doing the walk of shame .
you know what that means , right ?
i was having sex all night with a stranger .
i had sex with a guy all night once .
at least that &apos;s what he said . i fell asleep at 10 : 00 .
sophie , come in .
we wanted to ask you something kind of important .
oh , okay .
well , i &apos;ll tell you .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna make it in the cupcake business .
not what the psychic in the subway told me ,
but duly noted .
actually , it &apos;s more of a personal question .
oh , okay . well , i personally
don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna make it in the cupcake business .
no , the question is about oleg .
oh , yeah , he agrees with me .
god &apos;s sakes , just tell her before she tells us
we &apos;re gonna wind up in some disgusting apartment ,
hiding from our pimp .
okay , okay , sophie .
do you ever think about getting back together with oleg ?
oh , god , no .
i &apos;d rather accidently have sex again with my cousin .
i hate when that happens .
why , did--
did he ask about me ?
oh , no , no . i was just wondering .
he never even mentions you .
oh , good .
&apos;cause i moved on , baby .
oh , no . no , i--
i left my spanx on that staten island stoop .
and they &apos;re the good ones , you know ,
with the pee hole in them .
i gotta go grab &apos; em .
all right . bye @-@ bye .
okay , good . now we &apos;ve got the power on ,
but how do we steam the milk ?
maybe it &apos;s on this touchpad thing .
holy mother of god !
i just steamed my vagina .
max , caroline , your shift started three minutes ago .
who cares about sidework ?
i probably can &apos;t have children .
what is wrong with her ?
she just had her carpet steam @-@ cleaned .
you two still haven &apos;t figured out this machine ?
move away . i &apos;m asian and a man .
i &apos;m good with this kind of stuff .
well , han , actually , it &apos;s pretty dangerous .
hey , han &apos;s a man , according to recent lore .
let him save the day .
okay , let &apos;s see . here &apos;s the steam one .
and here &apos;s the button for-- ow !
my neck !
it burned my neck !
and that was my best feature .
luckily you &apos;re not taller .
you would &apos;ve burned your vagina .
that cappuccino machine might have just
given me a grande hysterectomy .
caroline , i know this might not be a good time .
i heard about your recent clambake .
but what did sophie say ?
i &apos;m sorry , oleg . sophie &apos;s moved on .
she &apos;s seeing other men .
yeah , but not in your neighborhood .
she &apos;s classy .
she had the decency to do it on a stoop in staten island .
she went to the island without me ?
we were going to travel the world together .
oleg--
oleg , are you crying ?
no , i have a booger situation .
says the man who cooks the food .
hey , what &apos;s this area back there ?
uh , it &apos;s our closet , why ?
i should check it out .
i &apos;m always looking for places
to have sex with women who are not sophie .
is oleg in here ?
i thought i smelled him .
that delicious mix of man and butter .
oleg &apos;s in the closet .
oh , honey , i could &apos;ve told you that .
really , luis , oleg is straight .
wait till you see what happens
when i place an order for a bone @-@ in rib eye .
it &apos;s true . he shows us his penis every--
ah @-@ ah @-@ ah @-@ ah , boundaries , girls , boundaries .
so is it a nice one ?
well , it did open a door for me once .
hey , luis , maybe you can help us .
since you &apos;re a lifer ,
you have to know how to work this thing .
no , no , no , no , no , no , i work for a diner .
i don &apos;t work for you .
don &apos;t bring me into your drama .
oh , i have to get this .
it &apos;s my mother . she &apos;s on death watch .
but we used to have the same machine
when i worked at starbucks .
mami , como esta su lou gehrig &apos;s ?
no , i am not working at starbucks .
that &apos;s not what i was gonna say .
just for two hours .
we can quit after we learn how to work this damn machine .
hey , i am not a quitter .
i get fired . that &apos;s my wheelhouse .
i can &apos;t believe we got hired so quickly .
and i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m a medium apron .
and i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m working
for a corporate coffee place .
this might be the lowest point of my life ,
and my mom once lost me
in a craps game behind a casino .
hi , we &apos;re here to be trained .
i know . that &apos;s unfortunate .
my name &apos;s devon .
well , that &apos;s unfortunate .
let &apos;s get this over with .
i have a lot of other places i need to be .
like your mom &apos;s basement ?
hey , you don &apos;t have to give me attitude .
i don &apos;t have to , but it &apos;s my pleasure .
sorry , devon . it &apos;s just that it &apos;s hard for her ,
&apos;cause your name is devon .
so what are you girls ? writers ?
folk duo ? just bitches ?
nailed it , loser .
max , pace yourself .
we need this job for another hour and 50 minutes .
okay , but for real , how long do you gotta work here
before the health insurance kicks in ?
and is there dental ?
&apos;cause i got a dead tooth doing nothing for me .
the insurance kicks in after 30 days .
but it &apos;s a ppo , not an hmo .
oh , we just got an hmo at our other job .
he &apos;s a charlotte .
okay , here we go .
look , this is the machine we use for everything .
it &apos;s incredibly easy to work
unless you &apos;re stupid ,
in which case , tell me now .
devon , we &apos;re not your mean stepdad .
just show us how to use the machine .
listen up .
unlatch the portafilter from the group head .
press here for an ounce of grounds .
tamp it in , pack it down , turn it on .
i didn &apos;t get that , did you ?
honestly , all i heard was group head .
so you tamp , pack , turn the knob ,
wait 3 , blast for 30 , then you pour the shot .
place the steam wand halfway in the pitcher
at a 45 @-@ degree angle until the milk is 103 degrees .
so what you &apos;re saying is it &apos;s easier to make meth ?
syrups , powders , whipped cream is right here .
you ever work with one of these ?
i think i can handle it . i went to wharton .
well , i went to harvard .
and i went to juvie .
and we &apos;re all here wearing an apron .
a grande double cap , non @-@ fat .
grande double cap , non @-@ fat .
meow , meow , meow , meow , meow .
a venti triple cap , no whip .
venti triple cap , no whip .
meow , meow , shmeow , meow .
grande double soy latte .
grande double soy latte .
got it , max ?
nope .
where &apos;s those drinks , max ?
working on it , getting close .
and i finished all over myself .
that &apos;s so me .
come on , max , it can &apos;t be that hard .
you two , switch .
i gotta put out more napkins .
that women &apos;s breakup support group is here ,
and they tap us out .
think they &apos;re crying now ?
just wait till we run out of cake pops .
i &apos;ll have a tall cap , triple @-@ shot half caf .
small scrap , nipple slap , half half .
that &apos;s not what i said .
tall cap triple @-@ shot half caf ?
girl , you &apos;re good at this .
you should work at starbucks .
i am good . i think i &apos;m getting the hang of this .
now i just have to--
holy mother of-- ouch !
this thing hates women so much ,
we should call it texas .
or ohio .
or , to be honest , most of america .
i &apos;ll have a tall drip , extra hot .
uh , what &apos;s your name ?
gregg , with thres &quot; g &quot; s .
yeah , you &apos;re gonna be this picture of a penis .
that &apos;s rude .
now it has a hat on it .
it &apos;s saying , &quot; good day . &quot;
do you want me to talk to your manager ?
yeah , in about 20 minutes ,
after she learns this machine .
hi .
i &apos;ll take a non @-@ fat venti drip for vera
and a tall latte for fran
and a gingerbread latte with 11 splendas .
can you two explain what this is ?
i &apos;d say it &apos;s pretty obvious .
that &apos;s a penis wearing a hat .
why ?
because it &apos;s bald and a little insecure .
dudes , you &apos;re , like , fired .
come on , devon .
we just need 20 more minutes to learn that machine .
please ?
no .
return your aprons and caps .
and do not even think
about putting sandwiches in your pockets .
what ?
a girl can &apos;t get a morning bun ?
no and no .
and take this &quot; crappuccino &quot; you made with you .
oh , yeah , that is not quite right .
and it hit my dead tooth .
how you doing with that milk ?
great .
mine &apos;s more whipped than nick cannon .
hola , chicas .
how &apos;s it going with your new machine ?
not that i care or am invested at all .
oh , i think mine &apos;s coming .
i think mine &apos;s coming .
you don &apos;t even know if you &apos;re coming or not ?
that &apos;s so you .
have you seen oleg ?
no , not since he came out of the closet .
why are you looking for him ?
how is this your business ?
because you said , &quot; have you seen oleg ? &quot;
you got me .
look at you .
so much spice , so much pain .
you got me .
hey , everybody .
hola , oleg , and oleg &apos;s sister ?
this is sasha .
we met last night
and a few times this morning .
but do me a favor .
don &apos;t tell sophie about this ?
no , do tell her .
i &apos;ve moved on .
i filled that hole she left .
come on ,
let &apos;s get you back to your uncle &apos;s house
before he wakes up .
oh , it happens to a lot of gays .
they come out , they freak out ,
they go back in .
but i see him .
and i &apos;ll be here until he sees me .
hola , mami .
charlotte &apos;s headed for a fall .
i did it . i made a perfect cappuccino .
75 % of my body is burned , but i did it .
so how is it ?
we are so putting the small scrap ,
nipple slap , half half on the menu .
