desperate housewives s06 e10
previously on ...
orson &apos;s blackmailing me to stay with him .
to escape her marriage ...
lamar benjamin ?
you know my husband orson from the state penitentiary .
bree arranged her own blackmail ...
i don &apos;t want to fight anymore .
while a friendship ...
hit the rocks .
lynette , you wanted to sue us !
that proves that you are not my friend .
oh , my god !
all right , calm down . all right ? i &apos;m not an idiot .
i used a prepaid , and there &apos;s no way they &apos;re
ever gonna find us .
i killed a man .
a desperate act ...
danny ? no , no , no , no , no , no !
led to a revelation .
would you like some juice ?
danny ? my name &apos;s tyler .
the whole time i was with you ,
all i thought about was susan .
and a revelation ...
if you mean it , then please kill me .
i don &apos;t care enough about you to kill you .
led to a desperate act .
i need an ambulance right away .
i &apos;m losing a lot of blood .
daphne bicks was an unhappy woman .
and no one knew this better than her husband .
that &apos;s why he hired her to work with him .
he thought it might cheer her up .
but sadly ,
jeff bicks soon discovered
that it would take a lot more than a job ...
this coffee &apos;s cold .
to keep his wife from complaining .
she complained from the moment they got up in the morning ...
well , another sleepless night thanks to your snoring .
till they were on their way home
at the end of the day .
you want to see if you can hit all the red lights ?
things had gotten so bad ,
jeff bicks began to wonder when
god would end his suffering .
luckily for jeff ,
god had a plan .
you &apos;re unbelievable ! you &apos;re so cheap .
it &apos;s friggin &apos; christmas , for god sake .
i &apos;m not buying you a new car .
tricia reed &apos;s husband got her a new car .
it isn &apos;t even a holiday .
he bought it for her because she beat cancer .
you beat cancer , i &apos;ll buy you a car .
don &apos;t beat it , i &apos;ll buy you two .
why are we even together ?
the hot sex .
you &apos;re cheap , rude .
you lack ambition .
i should just dump your sorry ass .
you want a gift ? you want a gift ?
how about a divorce ?
ha . don &apos;t tempt me .
i &apos;m serious .
i already got the name of a divorce attorney .
you want a divorce ?
you got it !
yes , virginia , there is a santa claus ,
and he &apos;s giving me my balls back !
correction--one of them . get half of everything .
but not the business . i started that .
with my father &apos;s money .
so i get half , and i &apos;m selling it .
wait a minute . let &apos;s talk about this .
oh @-@ ho ! so now you &apos;re scared ?
you &apos;d be that vindictive ?
destroy the one thing i love out of spite ?
hello ? ! have we met ? of course i would .
and i am not stopping there .
bank accounts , pension funds-- ooh , i &apos;m gonna ruin you .
oh , what &apos;s the matter ?
i can &apos;t breathe .
nice try , big faker .
oh ! my chest hurts like hell . take the controls .
what ?
ah ! you gotta land the plane .
what ? ! no ! you piece of crap !
you can &apos;t do this to me !
and that is how the unhappy marriage
of jeff and daphne bicks ended--
in a plane losing altitude
right above a cul @-@ de @-@ sac ...
hey , is it just me ,
or is that plane flying really low ?
by the name of wisteria lane .
dad , i think it &apos;s gonna crash .
the best christmas ever--
that &apos;s what the residents of wisteria lane were dreaming of
as they prepared for their annual yuletide festival .
so they hung up a banner ...
brought out their candy canes ...
and put up santa &apos;s workshop ,
as eager as children for the holiday to begin .
of course ,
some were more childish than others .
look at this mess . it &apos;s like santa &apos;s colon .
that &apos;s funny . did you hear that ?
hilarious . almost as funny as when orson said it last year .
okay . how about some christmas music ?
parker , you got that sound system fixed ?
almost .
do we really want the kid working with electricity ?
he can &apos;t even get the newspaper on my porch .
you &apos;re clumping .
hey , what is going on with you two ?
i don &apos;t want to get into it .
well , whatever it is , you need to work it out .
we are caroling at the festival on saturday ,
and we can &apos;t have two of our jingle belles fighting .
you know , if you need a replacement ,
i &apos;ve been told that i have a dusky alto .
no way !
girls only .
we &apos;re the jingle belles , not the jingle balls .
shouldn &apos;t you be out stealing the last can of who hash ?
you want to see me go all grinch on your ass ?
to be honest , bree , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able
to sing with lynette after she was--
after she what ? are you about to trash me ?
i have way too much class to trash you ,
no matter how much you deserve it .
merry christmas to me . what did she do ?
she &apos;s suing carlos .
you &apos;re suing him ?
because he fired me .
he fired her ?
because she lied about being pregnant .
you &apos;re pregnant ? !
with twins .
you knew ?
i told her to keep it quiet .
congratulations .
sure , take her side .
she &apos;s not !
stop fighting .
i mean , with all we &apos;ve been through lately--
julie being attacked , danny bolen &apos;s overdose--
we really need some christmas spirit around here .
susan &apos;s right .
this is the time we should come together
and celebrate peace on earth
and good will towards men and ...
oh , crap . who &apos;s dead now ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
something &apos;s happened to katherine .
oh , my god . i was just there five minutes ago .
was she okay ?
well , she was really upset .
i hope she didn &apos;t do something to herself .
hey , you &apos;re not gonna believe this ,
but i just heard the cops say
that someone stabbed katherine right in the gut .
what ? who would do that ?
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
hey there . how you feeling ?
a little hungry .
that &apos;s &apos; cause they pumped your stomach .
but if you want , tyler ,
i can have them bring you some soup .
why did you just call me that ?
you told me to , last night .
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did . twice .
you were still a little groggy ,
but you definitely said your name was tyler .
um , maybe i was dreaming .
my name &apos;s danny .
okay .
um , can i see my mom ?
please .
i &apos;m sorry . not while you &apos;re under observation .
i &apos;ll have someone bring you that soup ... danny .
i don &apos;t get this . we gave you a check
to cover the ambulance and everything else so far .
i know .
but we still need your insurance information , mr . bolen .
it &apos;s hospital policy .
like us not being able to see our kid ?
so you have two stupid policies .
there could be some unforeseen expenses ,
tests we may have to run .
if you don &apos;t have insurance , there are government programs .
mm . if you could just give me your information--
no ! we don &apos;t need a handout .
we have cash . thank you , though .
gayle.can i speak with the bolens ?
i know what &apos;s going on .
what do you mean ?
i knew something was up
the moment you moved onto the lane .
i mean ... you never talk about your past .
well , we &apos;re private people . is there a law against that ?
having no insurance , wanting to pay cash for everything ,
having a son who can &apos;t remember if his name is danny or tyler ...
where you going with all this , mona ?
you &apos;re in the witness protection program , aren &apos;t you ?
you are one sharp cookie .
how &apos;d you figure it out ?
honestly ?
once i noticed you were italian , i just kinda went from there .
no offense .
none taken .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m right .
so ... what went down ? you witness a hit ?
did you rat on one of the five families ?
we , um ...
we can &apos;t talk about it , mona .
and neither can you , to anybody .
of course not .
because if you do say anything ...
we &apos;re gonna have to have you whacked .
any more news about mike and katherine ?
no . but i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be exonerated .
mike could never do something that awful .
that &apos;s my bree--always seeing the good in people .
yes .
forgive me for starting your day on a sour note ,
but i filed for divorce .
here are the papers .
and if you try to stop me ,
your parole officer will see these .
consorting with a known felon is a parole violation .
if you send me to jail for fraud ,
you &apos;re going with me .
it &apos;s over , orson .
this must have been quite a project for you--
finding lamar , setting up the camera .
sorry to put you through so much needless trouble .
i would hardly say needless .
without these , you &apos;d still have a gun to my head .
do you really think i would send you to jail ?
it &apos;s what you &apos;ve been threatening .
i was bluffing , bree , right from the start .
i could never hurt you that badly , no matter what .
y @-@ you didn &apos;t need these .
you could &apos;ve called my bluff and walked away anytime .
i suppose the fact that you did believe me ,
that you actually thought i &apos;d destroy you just out of spite ,
that alone should &apos;ve told me it was over .
i will pack after breakfast .
for what it &apos;s worth ,
i &apos;m sorry it had to end this way .
me , too .
these you made are delicious , i &apos;ll miss them .
here &apos;s katherine &apos;s room .
now you might hear some screams for help in there .
ignore them .
is that what you meant by , &quot; i &apos;ll behave calmly and rationally &quot; ?
that was just to get you to unlock the car door .
susan , you gotta go in there and be katherine mayfair &apos;s best friend ,
because she could put mike away for a very long time .
i know . i know .
might help if you give her these .
good idea .
she pisses me off , i can crack the vase over her head .
no , dylan . the police have everything under control .
there &apos;s no reason for you to fly out here .
uh , honey , i @-@ i &apos;ve got a visitor .
i gotta go .
okay , talk to you later .
susan , come in .
hi , katherine .
what a sweet gift .
i didn &apos;t even think i &apos;d see you here .
well , i was ... concerned about you , katherine .
a lot of people are .
actually , the one they should be concerned about is you .
why is that ?
because the man you just married
turned out to be a maniac .
yeah , um ...
about that--uh ...
we both know ...
that mike didn &apos;t do this .
really ?
i &apos;ve got seven stitches
and a knife with mike &apos;s fingerprints that say otherwise .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
why would mike want to stab you ?
well , if you must know ...
i told him i was in love with someone else ,
and he flew into a rage .
will you stop lying ?
if you don &apos;t tell the truth soon ,
you are sending an innocent man to jail .
you are taking a father away from his son .
it &apos;s mike &apos;s fault , not mine .
katherine , please !
even though i am so angry with him ,
when you think about it ,
it &apos;s really kind of flattering ...
to go this far to keep me from being with someone else .
so how did it go ?
i don &apos;t know anymore .
i can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s crazy or just devious
i think she &apos;s a little of both .
okay . so tell me how i get the crazy part committed .
only a family member
can commit somebody to an institution .
really ?
excuse me .
i was just with my friend katherine in 607,
and she was talking to her daughter ,
and she wanted me to follow up about something .
do you have that number ?
dylan mayfai
yes . would you mind dialing that number ?
certainly .
there you go .
hello .
this is dr. brewster calling from fairview general .
i understand that you were just speaking with your mother .
right .
well , i do feel , given her condition ,
it is important for you to come here if you can .
lovely .
see you soon .
now that &apos;s devious .
50 cents off paper towels--
that &apos;s a great coupon .
this is fun .
yeah , it sure is .
and me doing my own roots is gonna be fun ,
and getting rid of cable is gonna be fun .
we &apos;re gonna be having so much fun around here .
mommy ?
hmm ?
are we poor ?
oh . only financially .
hey . hey , don &apos;t forget that one .
ravioli in a can ? i like poor food !
what &apos;d they say ?
i &apos;ve attended classes for six weeks .
they won &apos;t refund any of my tuition .
unbelievable .
is there a sign over us that says &quot; crap here &quot; ?
it &apos;ll be okay .
i &apos;m looking for a job , and in the meantime ,
we got enough money live on for the next ... mm , four months ?
so we &apos;ll run out right before the babies are born .
yes , but remember ,
kids don &apos;t miss what they never had .
ah , like food , clothing , sober mother ?
i am so sorry .
for what ?
for what i have done to this family .
you have to drop out of school .
penny is clipping coupons .
i have really , really screwed this up .
well , we &apos;ll get some money if we win the lawsuit .
yeah . won &apos;t that be great ?
maybe it &apos;s your turn .
damn it !
whatever it is , i can explain .
that was the chairman of my board .
this lynette thing is turning into a fiasco .
i thought that lawyer said you did everything by the book ,
that we were covered .
it doesn &apos;t matter what the lawyer said .
bottom line is , it looks bad for global venture--
big corporation going after a pregnant woman .
so what &apos;s gonna happen ?
if this suit goes to trial ...
i &apos;m done .
and even if it doesn &apos;t , i might still lose my job .
i &apos;ve put everything into this company .
carlos .
carlos .
hi . i know i &apos;m probably the last person you want to talk to .
you got that right .
it &apos;s , uh , done , karl .
orson signed the papers .
yes , uh , i know .
i &apos;ve never been happier .
i absolutely want to see you , too .
uh , meet me at the motel ,
and we &apos;ll find a way to celebrate .
till then , my darling .
when you move on , you don &apos;t waste any time .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted to tell you this morning ,
but i ... felt i &apos;d hurt you enough for one day .
yes .
much better to parcel out the pain .
is it someone i know ?
no , no , never mind .
i can &apos;t handle that right now .
just , uh , tell me this ...
have you told your friends you &apos;re seeing anyone ?
of course not .
good .
please don &apos;t until i &apos;m gone .
i &apos;m saying good @-@ bye to everyone at the party tomorrow .
i don &apos;t want it to turn into a pity fest for poor orson .
i won &apos;t go public with my new relationship
until we &apos;re divorced .
and i &apos;ll say we started seeing each other ...
after you and i separate .
what a tasteful solution .
you must write an etiquette book for adulterers .
i don &apos;t blame you for being angry .
and i give you my word ,
i will not let my affair be an embarrassment to you .
so when the plane flies over the christmas party ,
i want it pulling a big @-@ ass banner
that reads ,
&quot; will you marry me , bree ?
love , karl . &quot;
oh , isn &apos;t that romantic ?
glorious . that &apos;ll be 600 bucks .
i don &apos;t care . you can &apos;t put a price on love .
he can . our anniversary ?
$ 20 gift certificate to a rib joint .
well , you didn &apos;t have to cook that night .
so the gift was for both of us .
good luck , mr. mayer .
i hope this bree says yes ...
almost as much as i wish i had said no .
for what it &apos;s worth , i &apos;m a divorce lawyer .
oh , for god sake !
jeff , look at the mess in here !
do you have a card ?
dylan .
dylan !
i have nothing to say to you .
i know what your mother must have told you .
it &apos;s what she told everyone . but it &apos;s not true .
do you really think i &apos;m gonna take your word over hers ?
please . i am so worried about your mom .
i am not just thinking about mike .
what he hell you &apos;re not .
get over him . he &apos;s married to my mother .
what ?
you know
it &apos;s bad enough that you make a scene at their wedding
and you hound them night and day .
and you stab her because you can &apos;t have him ?
is that what she told you ?
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re not locked up right now .
you &apos;re crazy .
dylan !
we need to talk .
oh , my god .
i don &apos;t understand .
for months , my mom has been telling me
about her life with mike--
the gifts that he &apos;s given her
and trips that they &apos;ve planned .
your mom needs help .
and so does mike .
what do you want me to do ?
hey , good news .
dr. cheng says
i can give your parents an early christmas present .
you &apos;re released .
grab your stuff . i &apos;m taking you home .
hey , thanks for the ride .
happy to help .
i can &apos;t imagine
how tough it is for you guys to live this way .
what way ?
running all these years ,
always looking over your shoulder .
relax , danny .
your parents told me about your situation .
well , actually , i figured it out .
your mom just filled in the details .
why would she do that ?
well , frankly , i think she was glad
to finally find someone she could be honest with .
and that goes for you , too .
if you ever need to talk , you can trust me .
i hope so .
&apos;cause if you say anything ,
they &apos;re gonna throw my mom in jail .
no , no . it doesn &apos;t work that way .
are you kidding ?
ever since 9 / 11,
the feds are hard @-@ core on any terrorist stuff ,
even the old cases .
if they find her , she &apos;s dead .
what do you mean ?
danny !
i thought we were picking you up tomorrow .
ma , i screwed up .
what are you talking about ?
i told mona everything .
hey , mona .
thanks for giving danny a ride .
and , oh , i am so sorry
he dragged you into our family drama .
i mean , you know better than anyone
what a bad head space he &apos;s in right now .
he &apos;s so angry at me and his dad , he just wants to hurt us ,
which would explain the wild story he just told you .
so ...
we good ?
i hate my job .
all i do is deal with disturbed people ,
wipe their drool ,
strap them down .
i hate it .
well ...
maybe you should get a different job .
i wanted to ,
but they say you should have
a year &apos;s worth of living expenses .
and i didn &apos;t know where i &apos;d get the money .
$ 67,000 .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve needed to cover my mortgage , my car ,
everything for a year .
mona--
67 grand .
if you could do that for me ,
then we &apos;d all be free .
hey , mom .
dylan !
what are you doing here ? i @-@ i asked you not to come .
i had to .
you were hurt .
have you been to the house ?
oh , i &apos;m so sorry mike wasn &apos;t there to welcome you .
he &apos;s away on business .
no , he &apos;s in jail .
you told the police he stabbed you .
i ... never said that .
i told you-- susan attacked me .
then why did the police arrest mike ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe he confessed to protect her .
mom , susan &apos;s his wife .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
what--who told you that ? susan ?
no . mike .
they let me speak with him .
mom , mike is in jail ,
and that not right if he didn &apos;t do anything .
did you stab yourself ?
mom , did you ?
i asked you not to come .
oh , mom .
you don &apos;t understand .
susan trapped him ,
filled his head with lies .
this is gonna save him .
he knows why i did it . he wants this .
what is she doing here ?
i wanna help you , katherine .
i have to get to mike .
he &apos;s expecting me .
i can fix it.you &apos;ll see ! i have to go !
mom , please .
mrs. mayfair !
oh ! we need a little help here .
mom , please !
everything &apos;s gonna be wonderful !
no , i have to get to mike !
no ! no ! get your hands off of me !
need some help here . mrs. mayfair
mrs. may ...
no ! no ! no !
please , mrs. mayfair , we &apos;re trying to help you .
okay , it--it--it &apos;s okay .
honey , everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
i asked you not to come .
hey , wait up . i wanna go with you .
can &apos;t i have one moment of peace ?
our therapist said we need to do more stuff together .
i know . that &apos;s why i don &apos;t go to the
therapist with you .
oh , come on .
would it kill you to spend some time with the woman you love ?
i don &apos;t know . would you be upset if i brought her ?
as long as she doesn &apos;t deflate in the plane .
gaby , please talk to me . i feel just awful .
you know why ? because you are awful .
you &apos;re an awful person .
okay ,
you have every right to be mad at me .
thanks , lynette ,
and you have every right to go to hell .
stop talking to me !
thank you , all , for coming out to our annual holiday festival .
and , as it &apos;s been our tradition these last 12 years ,
please welcome back the jingle belles .
all right , ladies . sparkle !
i can &apos;t believe they wouldn &apos;t let you sing with them .
it &apos;s their group .
they can do whatever they want .
whores .
silent night
* holy night ... *
do you mind ? you &apos;re blocking me with your big fat head .
i thought we weren &apos;t talking .
* round yon virgin mother ... *
you know , i was trying to apologize .
well , it &apos;s too late . carlos is probably gonna lose his job
over this stuff you &apos;re putting him through .
well , gee , i wonder what that feels like .
* sleep in heavenly peace ... *
by the way , because your husband canned me ,
tom had to quit school .
aw , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old freshman has to drop out ?
maybe he &apos;ll get a paper route .
move !
no .
fine . you want to be a jerk ?
gaby , give me my hat back .
no ! no !
gaby , give me my hat back !
give that back to me ! give me my hat back !
gaby , give it back !
all is calm ! all is calm !
don &apos;t look at me . she &apos;s the one who started it !
she &apos;s being a bitch .
i don &apos;t remember the word &quot; bitch &quot; being in the song .
oh , no , it &apos;s always been there .
you are ... aah !
we are going to take a little ... uh , break mid @-@ song ,
and we will be right back .
have a little punch .
i realize you two are having a problem ... a giant problem .
and now half of fairview does , too .
so , &quot; a , &quot; you &apos;re fired , and &quot; b , &quot; work it out .
gaby , i &apos;m sorry about everything ,
but you have no idea
what losing my job has done to my family .
oh , boo @-@ hoo , you .
why don &apos;t you slip your kankles
into my shoes and walk a mile ?
you just don &apos;t care about anyone but yourself .
i do . i care about my friends .
sorry you are no longer a part of that group .
i &apos;m in .
it &apos;s a christmas miracle !
we can &apos;t just let some stupid housewife
shake us down for 67 grand .
nick , what do you want from me ?
we gotta try to make this go away .
we got the emergency 10 grand ,
but that is a long way from $ 67,000 .
maybe this &apos;ll get us closer .
oh , you little ...
now do be careful , you little munchkins .
excuse me .
karl ? what are you doing here ?
i just thought i &apos;d come by
and give you an early christmas present .
stop it ! we can &apos;t be seen together .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
susan knows . the cat &apos;s out of the bag .
orson doesn &apos;t know .
you didn &apos;t tell him ?
about the affair , yes .
but he has no idea it &apos;s you .
now , karl , please go .
i promised him there &apos;d be no scenes today .
karl ?
oh , lord .
hey , orson . just came by to check on the decorations .
great job , mrs. hodge .
save it , karl . i &apos;m not an idiot .
orson , please .
you obviously heard bree and i are divorcing ,
and , vulture that you are ,
you &apos;ve swooped in to make a buck by representing bree .
hey , a man &apos;s gotta eat .
perhaps . but soliciting business at a christmas party ?
that &apos;s tacky , even for you , karl .
if this is who you want representing you ,
that &apos;s your choice .
but frankly , i thought you had higher standards .
remind me not to let him make a toast at our wedding .
it &apos;s not funny , karl .
now just go before he figures it out .
yeah , about that ...
uh , you know that christmas present i mentioned ?
don &apos;t you dare give me a present
in front of all these people !
i &apos;m not sure i can stop it . it &apos;s being delivered ... by air .
karl , what did you do ?
just let me make one quick call .
mayday ! mayday !
god , how do you turn this thing on ?
somebody help !
i don &apos;t know how to fly !
okay , i released the banner . now what ?
look for a place to land ...
a field , a large parking lot .
all i see are neighborhoods .
negative . street landing is too dangerous .
well , that &apos;s all there is ! what do you want from me ? !
okay , calm down . keep her steady .
jeff , it &apos;s karl . are you there ?
hello ?
come on , pick up . okay .
if you get this message ,
and please , please get this message ... you need to abort .
do not , repeat , do not fly over
wisteria park with that banner .
what banner ?
call me .
karl , what banner ?
you know how you &apos;re always saying to me
i should be more romantic ? well , i thought ,
what if i hire a plane to fly over bree &apos;s street
carrying a banner with a heart felt personal message ?
karl , when you put a message on a banner ,
it ceases to be personal . what does it say ?
uh , something like , uh ...
bree , will you marry me ? love karl .
oh , dear god !
i was trying to be romantic .
karl , when we began this affair , we agreed to be discreet .
do you know what discreet means ?
no skywriting !
oh , god ! poor orson !
do you know how humiliated he &apos;ll be ?
i have to warn him .
bree , wait .
i made this mess .
i &apos;ll deal with it .
orson deserves the truth ,
and he should hear it from me , not a banner .
but i ...
you got a minute ? i need to talk to you .
what , here ? can &apos;t it wait ?
uh , not really .
if this is about the settlement ,
i told bree there &apos;s very little i want .
that &apos;s not the problem .
it &apos;s what i want ... bree .
you &apos;re too late . she has a boyfriend .
you ?
hey , if i were a betting man ,
i &apos;ve lost a bundle on this , too .
so wait .
you &apos;re having sex with my wife ?
the point is ,
we don &apos;t wanna make this any harder for you
than it has to be .
i just wanted to warn you that in a few minutes ...
okay , you &apos;re the husband .
i &apos;ll give you that one .
i &apos;m trying to spare your feelings , which is why ...
that &apos;s it .
the hell with your feelings .
i am proposing to bree today with an airplane banner .
and trust me , that will be the highlight of your day !
one moment , please .
* joy to the world ! *
* the lord is come *
* let earth receive ... *
hi .
hi ! have you been to see santa yet ?
unh @-@ unh . you want me to take you ?
yeah ? okay .
celia !
come on . i will take you to see santa .
* and heaven *
* and heaven and nature sing *
hey .
oh . we &apos;re gonna do this right here ? just like that ?
this seems like a pretty small envelope
for such a big secret .
it &apos;s 10 grand .
and my wedding ring . it was my grandmother &apos;s .
it &apos;s all we have right now .
but ... i gave notice at the hospital .
i can &apos;t go back there .
mona , that &apos;s the best we can do .
i have a job at bree &apos;s .
i could pay the rest as i make it .
sure , until you disappear into thin air .
just because i have lawn gnomes doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid .
you don &apos;t know the whole story .
i know you killed someone and walked away scot @-@ free .
scot @-@ free ?
does this look scot @-@ free ?
yeah , i don &apos;t think danny told you the whole story ,
but maybe you should hear it .
4 miles i ran today , and now i &apos;m drinking eggnog .
it &apos;s like mayonnaise with rum in it .
excuse me .
what are you doing ? ! stop it !
this is ridiculous ! please !
oh , for god sakes , stop it !
and that was 18 years ago ,
and we &apos;ve been looking over our shoulders ever since .
that sounds like a very reasonable story ...
so reasonable that i don &apos;t understand
why you couldn &apos;t just call the police right now
and explain it to them .
someone &apos;s dead . you know i can &apos;t do that .
what i know is you &apos;ve got till tomorrow
to come up with the rest of the money ,
or i go to the police . capisce ?
is it just me ,
or is that plane flying really low ?
mona , can we talk about this ?
don &apos;t do this .
you are screwing with people &apos;s lives here .
this could blow up in your face .
$ 67,000 by tomorrow or i call the police .
house . house .
house !
hey , we &apos;re not done here .
you can run , but you can &apos;t hide !
celia !
run !
the best christmas ever ...
that &apos;s what everyone had wanted .
but something went wrong ...
horribly wrong .
for those who survived ,
it would be a day they would try to forget .
for those who didn &apos;t ,
this christmas would simply be ...
