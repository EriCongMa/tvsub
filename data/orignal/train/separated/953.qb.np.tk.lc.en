第三季 第十三集
&lt; i &gt; while ian &apos;s wife jane was in a coma ... &lt; / i &gt;
do we have a deal ?
&lt; i &gt; susan got an ultimatum . &lt; / i &gt;
he &apos;s not crazy about me spending time with my ex .
&lt; i &gt; - mike &apos;s new hero ... &lt; / i &gt;
i owe you one .
after those mutts knocked you around ,
your boy paid them off .
&lt; i &gt; ... had a secret agenda . &lt; / i &gt;
gabrielle .
&lt; i &gt; gabrielle learned the identity ... &lt; / i &gt;
i &apos;m rich . i can give you anything you want .
&lt; i &gt; of her secret admirer . &lt; / i &gt;
tell me everything .
&lt; i &gt; and orson &apos;s mother shared some family secrets &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that bree would later discover . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; if there was one thing orson hodge understood , it was teeth . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; that &apos;s why people stopped him at barbecues ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; during cocktail parties , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; and in the occasional men &apos;s room . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yes , when it came to teeth , &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; people expected dr. hodge to have all the answers . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; sadly for orson , this was not always the case . &lt; / i &gt;
well , it does look a little fishy .
fishy ? it couldn &apos;t be more obvious .
alma killed monique . that &apos;s why she disappeared .
she pulled the teeth so people would suspect her husband .
why would she keep them ?
she would probably sneak in and plant them in our house .
well , we &apos;ve saved her the trouble , haven &apos;t we ? is it a full set ?
orson , not on the duvet .
oh ! they won &apos;t stain .
i don &apos;t care .
i am not sleeping in a bed that
had your dead mistress &apos;s teeth in it .
let &apos;s just take them to the police .
and say what ?
we can &apos;t prove these came from alma &apos;s .
she &apos;ll deny ever having seen them .
don &apos;t forget , i &apos;m the one they suspect .
we have to do something .
i agree , but not until we put these back in her house .
and then we &apos;ll call the police .
trust me . she &apos;ll never get away with it .
hello . you &apos;ve been very naughty , haven &apos;t you ?
orson ? is that you ?
i know what you and alma are up to , and it &apos;s gonna stop .
&lt; i &gt; yes , orson was an expert on teeth . &lt; / i &gt;
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , i think you do .
&lt; i &gt; that &apos;s how he could tell &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; when people were lying through them . &lt; i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; it can happen so quickly . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; in the moment it takes a gunman &apos;s bullet &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to enter his victim &apos;s leg . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; in the time it takes to tell a wife &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; her husband won &apos;t be home for dinner . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; in the instant it takes a father &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; to meet his son for the very first time . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; yes , life as we know it can change in a heartbeat . &lt; / i &gt;
jane &apos;s still running a fever ?
yes .
and she hasn &apos;t responded
to any of the meds that we &apos;ve tried .
you think we should call her husband ?
not just yet .
let &apos;s try vancomycin . it worked for her before .
i don &apos;t want ian to worry .
this is your new lawyer , alan marcus .
alan , this is mike delfino .
hey . sorry i couldn &apos;t start on your case sooner .
i was wrapping up an armed robbery trial .
it &apos;s nice to finally meet you .
and you must be ian .
i can &apos;t thank you enough for helping me out here .
susan and i are happy to be of assistance .
so should we get started ?
sure .
so i &apos;ve had a chance to review all the evidence against you ,
and i &apos;ve got a strategy
to ensure your case never goes to trial .
don &apos;t you love this guy ? what &apos;s the strategy ?
pleading guilty ? what kind of strategy is that ?
he &apos;d be pleading to manslaughter .
it &apos;s ten years in prison .
better than life , which mike &apos;s risking if he goes to trial .
with good behavior , he could be out in five .
with a better lawyer , he could be out in zero .
we need to find a lawyer who believes he &apos;s innocent .
but he evidence against him is very compelling .
you are letting your feelings for him cloud your judgment .
my feelings for him ? are we gonna do this again ?
you realize every conversation we have
winds up being about mike .
&quot; who &apos;s the best lawyer for mike ?
how can we get mike quitted ? &quot;
i have told you i love you a thousand times .
where is all this jealousy coming from ?
do you know what ? i have to catch that plane to montreal .
what ? no , ian . we have to talk about this .
i can &apos;t be late . it &apos;s business .
look , i have provided mike with the best lawyer i know .
if you want to get someone else , then you &apos;re on your own .
what ya doing ?
oh , deciding what to wear on my first day back to work .
do i look fat in this ?
i think you look good in everything .
your father &apos;s taught you well .
what about the street fair ?
if you &apos;re going to work , who &apos;s gonna take me ?
mrs. mccluskey . won &apos;t that be fun ?
no .
do you have to go back to work ?
come on .
you and your brothers &apos;ll be thrilled .
don &apos;t you get tired of me yelling at you
to clean up your room and finish your homework ?
yeah , but you &apos;ve been a lot nicer since you got shot .
oh . well , that &apos;s good to know .
when you think about it ,
me going back to work is not that big a deal .
we &apos;re only losing a little time in the afternoon .
but every hour counts . i miss you all day long .
oh , honey . jeez .
do you really mean that or are you manipulating mommy
into feeling incredibly guilty ?
a little bit of both .
yep . your father &apos;s taught you well .
the suspense is killing me .
shh . here it comes .
and now , the moment we &apos;ve all been waiting for ,
the winner of this year &apos;s little miss snowflake pageant is :
sherri maltby .
god , i &apos;m in shock .
i knew she had a shot at the top five , but to actually win ?
i was sure she &apos;d lose to that blonde bitch
who sang that patriotic medley .
i know .
she practically had sparklers coming out of her ass .
totally shameless .
let &apos;s go meet those reporters . what are you gonna tell &apos; em ?
i owe it all to beauty by vern .
attagirl .
oh . zach , what are you doing here ?
i came to support you .
oh . why don &apos;t you support me from the lobby ?
i have some networking to do .
my girl just won the pageant .
yeah , i know . and you &apos;re welcome .
what did you do ?
dont &apos;t worry , i paid the judges in cash .
there &apos;s no paper trail .
you bribed the judges ?
gaby , why are we fighting ? we should be celebrating .
i got a limo outside ,
a bottle of chilled cristal .
come on . let &apos;s go , let &apos;s party .
listen to me , you pimply psychopath .
you and i are never going to &quot; party . &quot;
in fact , the only reason we &apos;re ever gonna be
in the same room again is if you strangle a cheerleader
and i wind up on the jury .
god , i love it when we banter .
hello , alma .
orson .
i let myself in .
i hope you don &apos;t mind .
not at all .
you seem very cheerful .
i am .
because the game &apos;s over , and you lost .
i told you what i &apos;d do if you pushed me away .
well , i &apos;m afraid that threat no longer has any teeth in it .
yes , your mother told me about bree &apos;s little discovery .
what &apos;d you do with monique &apos;s teeth ?
maybe i threw them away . maybe i hid them here .
you might find them , if the police don &apos;t find them first .
you won &apos;t bring the police into this .
well , neither will you , now .
we &apos;re done . why don &apos;t you do us all a favor and go away ?
you shouldn &apos;t treat me this way .
don &apos;t bother crying .
tears might &apos;ve worked when we were married ,
after you lost the baby .
they won &apos;t work now .
we should have kept trying .
if we &apos;d had a child , we &apos;d still be together .
i know . that &apos;s why i stopped trying .
goodbye , alma .
well , here &apos;s some sucky news . ken just quit .
your new manager ? no .
yes , so i &apos;m screwed .
i &apos;m gonna have to drop out of the street fair .
tom , no , you can &apos;t , you can &apos;t .
the pizzeria opens in a week ,
and that street fair is the best advertising we &apos;re gonna get .
i know , but i can &apos;t work it alone .
well , you know , hire someone else .
there &apos;s no time for that .
the future of the restaurant is at stake .
it is time to get creative .
well , i do have one option .
but it would require some sacrifice .
well , whatever it is gonna take .
you could help me .
what ? no . uh @-@ uh . look , i &apos;m wearing makeup .
i am holding a briefcase .
what does this suggest to you ?
you could call in sick .
i can &apos;t call in sick after eight weeks of sick leave .
especially when i &apos;ve been fine for three of them .
crap . that &apos;s ed .
lynette , please .
you &apos;re the one who said that we need the street fair .
my boss is waiting for me outside in his car .
what am i supposed to do ?
it &apos;s time to get creative .
there she is .
hey , guys .
boy , didn &apos;t expect you to still be wearing a sling .
yeah , it heals a little slower when the bullet &apos;s still in there .
they couldn &apos;t get it out ?
no , it &apos;s too close .
to what ?
everything .
god , i &apos;m so sorry .
you &apos;ve got a little cereal right ...
cereal ? i didn &apos;t have any , uh ...
oh , i know what that is .
i get nauseous from the pain ,
so that &apos;s just a little residual vomit .
lynette , you sure you &apos;re ready to come back to work ?
yeah , don &apos;t be silly . i &apos;m fine .
come on , let &apos;s go sell some toothpaste .
alrighty , let &apos;s go .
ow ! son of a bitch !
i &apos;m sorry !
don &apos;t touch me .
anything we can do ?
my pills ! my pain pills . they &apos;re in my bag .
oh ! oh , my pills !
i need my pills and now they &apos;re all dirty .
see you next week . thanks for understanding .
hey , looks like an interesting book . what &apos;s it about ?
never mind . i &apos;ll wait for the movie .
what &apos;s eating you ?
those two guys you saved me from ?
i know you paid them to attack me .
that &apos;s a lie .
you wanna take a minute to reconsider that ?
ok , ok . i needed a favor
and i wanted you to owe me .
what favor ?
you sure you wanna get into this now ?
yeah .
ok . you remember my son , zach ?
vaguely . why ?
it turns out you and i share more than a cellblock .
hello , bree . may i come in ?
what &apos;s a garden without a snake ?
i realize i &apos;m not your favorite person ,
but i thought you should know why alma &apos;s moved here .
she wants orson back .
thanks for the heads @-@ up . now off you go .
orson and i may have our spats ,
but i &apos;m still deeply concerned about the state of his soul .
adultery is a sin .
i wouldn &apos;t worry about orson &apos;s soul .
he won &apos;t be sleeping with alma .
when i said adultery ,
i wasn &apos;t referring to orson and alma .
i meant orson and you .
excuse me ?
our church doesn &apos;t accept divorce .
in the eyes of god , you &apos;re the other woman .
i &apos;m sure you don &apos;t see it that way ,
but alma and i do .
and orson &apos;s beginning to .
are those shoes suede ?
yes . why ?
no reason .
why the hell didn &apos;t anybody tell me i had a son ?
you &apos;d just come out of a coma .
it probably figured you had enough on your plate .
why are you telling me now ?
zach and i haven &apos;t spoken in months .
every time i try to contact him , he won &apos;t return the calls .
i don &apos;t know what you expect me to do .
i barely remember the kid .
yes , but he remembers you .
and i think if you reach out to him , he &apos;ll talk to you .
zach is all i have left in the world .
through everything that &apos;s happened ,
i &apos;ve never stopped loving him .
can you please get him to come down here and see me ?
that &apos;s one hell of a favor .
man , you have some nerve .
i know . it &apos;s kinda what got me in here .
is it gaby &apos;s birthday ?
no .
they &apos;re probably from zach young .
what ?
you haven &apos;t heard ?
he has been begging gaby to go on a date with him .
he &apos;s been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her ,
even a diamond bracelet .
zach young ? our zach young ?
how does he afford diamonds ?
his grandfather left him all that money .
yeah , i thought it was in a trust , and he couldn &apos;t touch it .
until he turned 18 , which was a month ago .
so zach young is loaded , huh ?
no . absolutely not .
oh , come on . mike needs a great lawyer .
zach can afford a great lawyer .
i don &apos;t care .
i &apos;m not going out with zach young .
it &apos;s one little date .
you wouldn &apos;t let your own daughter go out with him .
you said he was a psycho .
he &apos;s matured .
to the tune of a billion dollars .
please do this , for mike .
susan , do you know what your obsession with mike
has cost you ?
first you piss off bree , and then ian ,
and now you &apos;re pimping me out to a teenager !
ok , i deserve the pimping remark .
but let &apos;s not pretend that , you know , we &apos;re above teenagers .
gaby , you &apos;re all i &apos;ve got .
oh ! fine . i &apos;ll do it .
thank you .
this is a noble thing you &apos;re doing .
how can you be so sure zach &apos;s gonna go along with this ?
oh , &apos; cause he &apos;s a great kid . and he &apos;s gonna wanna help mike .
and you &apos;re not gonna be wearing a bra
when you ask him out .
can you guys just take five , please ?
gabrielle , what are you doing here ?
wow . you have your own recording studio in your house ?
i needed a place to lay some tracks with my band .
you see that guy ?
he used to tour with the doobie brothers .
how wild is that ?
not as wild as what i &apos;m about to say .
you can take me to dinner .
seriously ? awesome .
yeah . here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna work .
we drive to the restaurant separately ,
we will not have dessert ,
and under no circumstances will you touch me . capisce ?
ok .
great .
in order for this magical night to occur ,
you need to help mike delfino .
mike ? what happened ?
he &apos;s in jail , for murder .
but susan swears he &apos;s innocent .
she wants you to get him a good lawyer .
all right . we have a deal ?
no .
no ?
oh , i would love to help mike .
it &apos;s just that if i &apos;m paying for a lawyer , you know ,
i would like to have more than just one meal with you .
i &apos;d like to have a whole day .
a whole day ?
yeah . here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna work .
uh , there &apos;s gonna be three meals , with dessert ,
activities of my choosing , and , uh ,
a good @-@ night kiss .
now do we have a deal ?
not quite .
the day starts with lunch , and that kiss , off the table .
did they set bail for mike ?
you know , &apos; cause i could throw that in , too .
one million dollars .
it &apos;s no biggie .
one call to my accountant and mike &apos;s a free man .
or do you wanna tell susan that
mike &apos;s gonna stay in jail
because you wouldn &apos;t kiss me ?
ok , deal , you little skunk .
here you go . you can come back for seconds .
our famous pepperoni pizza .
here &apos;s another bacon .
there you go .
great . guess what ?
our line is the biggest one at the fair . i counted .
you know what i &apos;m starting to think ?
this restaurant is gonna be a big , fat hit .
there you go .
can i talk to you about something ?
i think you hurt lynette &apos;s feelings
when you refused to go to the street fair with her .
she &apos;s gonna think you don &apos;t like her .
you don &apos;t want that , do you ?
doorbell .
some of them should be left on a hillside to rot .
hi . i &apos;m ed ferrara ,
lynette &apos;s boss .
is she around ?
well , actually , she &apos;s at the , uh , doctor &apos;s .
oh . yeah . well , could you give her this ?
sure .
and tell her to get well .
and she doesn &apos;t need to come back to work
till she &apos;s good and ready .
i will make sure she gets this .
ok .
excuse me , mister ?
i just wanted to tell you
our babysitter gets mixed up sometimes .
lynette &apos;s not at the doctor &apos;s .
she &apos;s not ?
nope .
well , where is she ?
excuse me .
try some of that . hey .
load me up again , would you ?
i &apos;m gonna poach some customers
from that sausage @-@ on @-@ a @-@ stick guy .
oh ! i love it when you &apos;re ruthless .
scavo &apos;s pizzeria !
try the smoked chicken and sun @-@ dried tomato .
oh ! this crust is fantastic .
it &apos;s cornmeal . that &apos;s the secret .
it &apos;s not your only secret , is it , lynette ?
hi , ed .
how &apos;s the arm ?
uh , on the mend .
i &apos;m gonna be there bright and early monday morning .
don &apos;t bother . you &apos;re fired .
wait , ed . ed , please don &apos;t go .
yes , i lied , and that was wrong ,
but my husband needed my help .
i need your help .
you &apos;ve been gone eight weeks , with pay ,
while the company &apos;s been falling apart .
now you pull this on me ?
i guess i really really wrong , but if you take me back ,
i swear , i &apos;ll give you a hundred percent .
so if we have to work late , you &apos;re gonna do it .
if i ask you to miss your kid &apos;s baseball game ,
you &apos;re gonna say , &quot; no problem , ed ? &quot;
you got it , ed .
good . i &apos;ll see you monday .
hi , it &apos;s me . listen , we have to talk .
ian , i &apos;m sorry too .
we gotta stop fighting like this .
susan , jane &apos;s doctor called me .
she &apos;s taken a bad turn .
oh . ian ...
i &apos;m on the next flight , but it &apos;s not for a few hours .
jane &apos;s parents are in rome .
would you go to the hospital for me ?
the hospital ?
i know it &apos;s a lot to ask .
but if something should happen ,
well , i don &apos;t want her to be alone .
oh , i &apos;m stuffed .
i can &apos;t believe you talked me into that creme brulee .
oh . don &apos;t feel guilty .
i &apos;m sure we burned it off on the dance floor .
i know . you &apos;re such a good dancer .
where &apos;d you learn how to salsa ?
i &apos;ve been taking lessons . &apos; cause i knew it was your favorite .
when did i say that ?
cosmo , &apos; 98 .
i knew you liked that merlot from vogue interview
you researched me ? that &apos;s sweet .
in a stalkery kind of way .
thanks again for a surprisingly enjoyable night .
see you around .
uh ... gabby .
oh , right , the kiss .
sorry . didn &apos;t mean to welsh on you .
all right , pucker up .
what the hell are you doing ?
you said i could kiss you .
yes ! my lips , not my esophagus .
for your information ,
i &apos;ve been told i &apos;m a very good kisser , all right ?
by who ? the same girl that taught you
to use your tongue like a windshield wiper ?
no , by women with lots of experience .
every single one said i was a great kisser .
how much did you pay them to say that ?
no !
you &apos;ve paid women for ...
it &apos;s none of your business , all right ? it &apos;s none of your business .
yes , it is . you just vacuumed my tonsils .
i deserve to know where that mouth has been .
you know what ? i &apos;m sorry . i gotta go .
zach . zach , i &apos;m not mad . ok ?
i &apos;m just a little grossed out , that &apos;s all .
you heard me , all right ? read my lips .
just go , all right ? go !
you &apos;ve got no right to be here .
all right .
what , another one ?
you organ @-@ donor people are vultures .
um , no , actually , i &apos;m a friend of ian &apos;s .
he asked me to come , for jane .
you &apos;re the girlfriend .
all right . that &apos;s ok , then . come on in .
so , erica , you were fighting with that guy when i came in .
have you had a lot of organ @-@ donor people around today ?
oh , that wasn &apos;t about that .
no , that was ted .
what , ian never told you about jane and ted ?
no . what about them ?
nothing . forget i mentioned it .
it is not my place .
what ?
they had an affair .
jane cheated on ian ? when was this ?
i hate to dish my best friend on her deathbed .
but gossip was the foundation of our relationship , so ...
it was five years ago .
ian was traveling a lot on business ,
jane was lonely , and along came ted .
i &apos;m just stunned .
so , i guess , they worked it out , right ?
well , ian took her back .
but if you &apos;re asking , did he ever trust her again ?
i don &apos;t think so .
poor ian .
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
i mean , to be betrayed by somebody you love that much ,
you &apos;re just never the same .
hey . what are you doing here ?
um , word on the street is you &apos;re looking for a manager .
yeah .
here &apos;s my application .
i thought ed took you back .
he did .
i told him i wasn &apos;t interested .
what ?
you &apos;re quitting ?
i had so much fun at the fair today .
working with you on something that was all ours .
i want every day to be like that .
honey , so do i.
are you sure ? your career &apos;s always meant so much to you .
when i got shot , lying there bleeding , i wasn &apos;t thinking ,
&quot; god , i &apos;m really gonna miss advertising . &quot;
i think this could be the best thing
that &apos;s ever happened to our family .
we can make our own hours .
we &apos;ll be together more .
and , yes , the money &apos;s gonna be a little tight ,
but i think this place could be a gold mine .
in that case , you &apos;re hired .
you do , of course , realize you have to sleep with the boss .
i can do that .
ok .
whoa . it &apos;s a little soon to be gunning for a promotion .
your mother not home yet ?
i haven &apos;t seen her .
hello ?
what is it now ?
alma did what ?
no , no . i &apos;ll be right over .
wait , wait . what ... what did alma do ?
i just thank the lord i got here when i did .
why didn &apos;t you call an ambulance ?
i thought it best for all concerned to keep this quiet .
by the way , she left a note .
若我不能和你在一起 那我也不想活了 阿尔玛
she only did this to upset me .
she knows my history .
she knows exactly what buttons to push .
orson , calm down . here .
our marriage is over .
i will not submit to emotional blackmail .
are you all right ?
i feel dizzy .
then , perhaps , you should just sit .
my god .
did you poison me ?
and kill my only child ?
you see how he talks to me ?
it &apos;s my fault . i upset him .
sorry about all this .
i just needed to get your attention .
why ? what do you want ?
what every mother wants , dear .
a grandchild .
well , why don &apos;t i give you two some privacy ?
thank you , mother hodge .
you mustn &apos;t struggle .
i want this baby to be born of love .
i &apos;ve been injecting myself with hormones
to improve our chances .
you wait and see . this is gonna fix everything .
you &apos;re crazy .
crazy for you , mister .
i won &apos;t . you can &apos;t make me .
yes , i can .
that drink had two kinds of pills in it .
one to put you to sleep ,
and one to keep the part of you i need nice and perky .
now , how about a little music ?
the doctor said her blood pressure &apos;s dropping .
she could go any time .
i gotta go call her parents .
hi .
it &apos;s me . we just took off .
i &apos;ll be there in about six hours .
sweetie , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s gonna make it that long .
don &apos;t tell me that .
you &apos;ve done everything you could .
she knows that you love her .
well , it &apos;s just , there &apos;s things i &apos;ve got to say to her .
i &apos;ve carried so much anger about something
that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i need her to know that .
i &apos;m gonna put the phone up to jane &apos;s ear ,
and you can tell her whatever you need to , ok ?
ok .
hello , jane , darling . it &apos;s ian .
i never imagined i &apos;d have to say goodbye to you like this .
there &apos;s so much i want to say .
you play that pretty well .
what are you doing here ?
i had a good time tonight .
but i hated the way it ended .
yeah , me , too .
gabby , about those women ...
forget about it . give a horny kid a couple of million bucks
and the yellow pages , and stuff is gonna happen .
it &apos;s not just them . i &apos;m paying everyone that i know .
those guys in my band , they &apos;re not my friends .
i &apos;m hiring them to hang out with me .
so stop doing it . stop buying people .
yeah , right . and then i &apos;d have no one at all .
that &apos;s not true .
you &apos;d have me .
as a friend . a friend friend , not a girlfriend .
i really cannot overstress that .
come on .
why would you wanna be my friend ?
we have zero in common .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe it &apos;s because i think we &apos;re both adrift .
it &apos;d just be nice to have a pal
who gets what i &apos;m going through .
why don &apos;t you play me something you wrote ?
yeah ? can i sing , too ?
sure . why not ?
all right .
&lt; i &gt; gabby , sweet gabby ... &lt; / i &gt;
whoa . why don &apos;t you just hum it , ok ?
sorry , my book club ran late .
didn &apos;t orson make you dinner ?
oh , no . he &apos;s been over at alma &apos;s .
he &apos;s been there for a few hours .
what the hell is this ?
oh , bree , i &apos;m so sorry you had to find out this way .
not as sorry as you are gonna be . orson , get up !
leave him alone . he wants to be with me now .
orsen , i have caught you cheating .
at least have the courtesy to wake up .
for god &apos;s sakes !
orson . orson .
what have you done to him ?
nothing .
you know men . the minute it &apos;s over , wham , off to dreamland .
he &apos;s not sleeping . he &apos;s out cold .
i knew it . these are sleeping pills , and these are ...
oh , my god .
you raped my husband .
we made love .
and when our baby &apos;s born , he &apos;s gonna come back to me .
baby ?
it &apos;s true .
i could be expecting right now .
were you expecting this ?
andrew , i need you to come over here right away , and , um ...
... bring the wheelbarrow .
do ... do you remember me ?
no . no , not really .
but i know who you are .
ok , good .
what you did , i &apos;m , um ... really grateful .
it &apos;s cool .
so if you need anything else , i guess , just let me know .
well , i do need something . but it &apos;s not for me .
so how are you doing ? you look terrific . really mature .
your mother would be proud .
thanks .
i &apos;ve , uh , really missed you a lot .
and i &apos;m sorry for ... for everything .
i hope you can forgive me . i want us to be friends .
and that &apos;s the only reason you wanted to see me , right ?
so we could be friends ?
yes .
ok .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s fine .
well , there is one other thing .
oh , yeah ?
it &apos;s just , felicia tillman faked her death . she &apos;s still out there .
you and i , we both know that .
if you gave or lent me some money ,
i could hire someone to track her down .
then i could get out of here ,
and you and i could pick up where we left off .
ok .
you asked me how i was doing . i &apos;m actually doing great .
i &apos;ve got the hottest ,
most amazing girlfriend in the entire world ,
and i am gonna marry that woman .
i &apos;m gonna buy her everything she wants .
so i have got to learn to say no
when people ask me for money .
because i &apos;ve got a future wife to think about .
she &apos;s got really expensive taste .
i mean , i do forgive you , though ... paul .
hey , susan .
hey . you &apos;re back .
yeah , zach young posted my bail .
but i &apos;m guessing you had something to do with it .
maybe a little .
is there any way that i can thank you
for everything you &apos;ve done ?
actually , yeah , there is .
good , good . just tell me .
i can &apos;t see you any more .
i want you to understand ,
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with you . it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s ok . i think i get it .
well , i , uh ... i should probably go .
bye . good luck with everything .
good luck to you and ian .
&lt; i &gt; yes , it can happen so quickly . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; life as we know it can change in the blink of an eye . &lt; / i &gt;
你的新朋友
&lt; i &gt; unlikely friendships can blossom . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; important careers can be tossed aside . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; a long lost hope can be rekindled . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; still , we &apos;d be grateful for whatever changes life throws at us . &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; because all too soon , the day will come ... &lt; / i &gt;
&lt; i &gt; ... when there are no changes left . &lt; / i &gt;
