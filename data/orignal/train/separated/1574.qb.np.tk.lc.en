callie is into me . we kissed at the wedding .
and that &apos;s why she ran away with wyatt ,
because she didn &apos;t want to mess up jude &apos;s adoption .
the only reason we &apos;re not together right now
is because she needs a family more than a boyfriend .
i don &apos;t belong here .
anyone else feel they don &apos;t belong here ?
i &apos;ve terminated my rights
so you guys can get adopted now .
i want to be a part of this family
more than i have ever wanted anything in my whole life .
she &apos;s over me .
sucks about callie . you deserve better .
i want to go back on my meds . can we start over ?
we are trying to have a baby .
oh , my god . a baby ?
maybe we should ... ask timothy .
so you read the donor contract ?
i don &apos;t think i can sign it .
should have never inseminated before we signed that contract .
i &apos;m pregnant .
oh , my god .
you bribed her ?
i just wanted to make sure dad didn &apos;t go to prison .
for $ 10,000 .
what &apos;s to stop her from going to the da anyway ?
freakin &apos; woman , i could kill her .
you haven &apos;t seen ana , have you ?
they saw her get into a screaming match with some guy .
i just got a message , and he sounded super drunk .
donald isn &apos;t my dad ?
according to the birth certificate ,
it says robert quinn .
you &apos;re going to walk into that courtroom ,
and officially become a member of this family .
if you &apos;re not going to be able to get adopted ,
does that change anything ?
no , it doesn &apos;t change anything .
what happened with the audition for the symphony ?
i got it .
all i have to do is tell them you set her up ,
because i bought back the ids .
what ids ?
the kids we sold to aren &apos;t going to talk .
i told you i was going to hit you where it hurt .
spaghetti and potato chips for breakfast ?
the baby wants it , jude . the baby wants it .
how &apos;s it feel ?
pretty good .
hopefully we &apos;ll be done with that thing after today , right ?
where &apos;s mariana ?
we were supposed to walk to school together .
she already left .
whatever .
peace out .
peace out .
ooh ! look at this .
is that ... ?
your birth certificate ?
yes , it is ! it is indeed ! go show mama .
oh , let me see ! let me see !
oh ! your hands .
let me see that .
oh , jude . this is so great .
so great . oh !
i just love you so much .
i love you , too .
that &apos;s awesome , bud .
what is ?
i got my birth certificate .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s amazing !
all right , you guys . let &apos;s get to court .
i will pick you up for your doctor &apos;s appointment after lunch .
got it .
listen , please do not worry .
you &apos;ll get a home run . ok ?
ok , let &apos;s get out of here !
sorry to ambush you like this .
your dad asked me to move in .
you &apos;re moving in with him ?
because i &apos;m in love with him , and he &apos;s in love with me .
you &apos;re in love with him ? you &apos;re not even faithful to him .
really ?
yeah .
and you &apos;re keeping all sorts of secrets from him .
i keep secrets from him because i love him .
he couldn &apos;t handle it , brandon .
look , i never told you this ...
but that night ...
the night that your dad
found out about everything you &apos;d been up to ...
when i found him , he was in really bad shape .
he could barely talk he was so drunk .
he had been in some sort of fight .
he had blood all over his hands .
he had blood on his hands ?
look , i &apos;m not telling you this because i want you to feel bad ,
i just want you to know how hard he took all of that .
so before you get any ideas about coming clean with him ,
just think about what it
would do to him if he found out that we ...
i mean , he could drink again ,
or he could hurt someone , or worse , he could hurt himself .
your dad needs me , and he needs you .
so you got to get over what happened ...
and just let it go .
so you are not ms. jacob &apos;s birth father ?
no .
when i met your mom , you were about six months old .
and she was with some ....
she was married to some guy named robert quinn
for a little while .
but ...
when he found out she was pregnant , he left .
callie , you gotta understand that ...
the first time that i held you , i felt like you were mine .
and by the time you were finally old enough to understand ,
it just seemed silly to try to explain it to you .
i mean , you were my daughter . that was that .
i mean , what is a father , anyways ?
is it the guy who got your mom pregnant and left ?
or is it the guy who changed your diapers ...
and held her when she was sick ?
i was there for her first words and her first steps .
thank you .
i appreciate that donald did raise callie until the age of ten ,
and that certainly makes a strong case
for his being her presumptive father ,
and therefore being able to terminate parental rights .
but because robert quinn was married to callie &apos;s mom ,
and because his name
is on her official birth certificate ,
yet he never signed it .
it &apos;s possible he never knew about her
and did not , in fact , knowingly abandon her as a baby .
so he needs to be notified about all of this .
i know it &apos;s frustrating ...
... but until there is signed consent from robert quinn ,
the adoption of callie jacob
by stefanie and lena adams foster is denied .
excuse me , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m looking for brandon foster , please . i &apos;m his mother .
he &apos;s right this way .
mama &apos;s here . i &apos;m here , ok ?
he was beaten up pretty good ,
but the ct didn &apos;t show any internal bleeding
or swelling in the brain .
ok , what happened to his hand ?
well , that &apos;s our biggest concern .
he has compound fractures .
the bones are shattered in several places .
he &apos;s going to need surgery .
shattered ?
he &apos;s a pianist .
he just got into the junior symphony .
our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all .
i &apos;ve got an orthopedic surgeon on her way .
uh , thank you .
he &apos;s gonna be okay .
baby , hey .
who did this to you ? who did this ?
vico .
ok , thumbs and pinky together .
and resist , good . relax .
how &apos;s the feeling ? any tingling , numbness ?
a little , but that &apos;ll go away , right ?
hopefully . i mean , we could operate again
but any remaining nerve damage is going to be hard to repair ,
and could potentially just make things worse .
but the bones are nicely healed .
you &apos;ve got between 90 and 95 percent function .
i &apos;m pretty happy with how it turned out .
good , he &apos;ll be able to play the piano again ?
like he used to , right ?
we hope so , yes .
but we won &apos;t know until he tries .
damn , yo . heinz 57 &apos;s looking good today .
heinz 57 ?
yeah , you know that stuff you put on meat ?
well , i want to put some of that on mine .
nice .
hey , babe . what &apos;s up ?
hayley &apos;s shorts , from the looks of it .
no kissing at practice .
this is nuts . we &apos;re gonna have to do this every day ?
i &apos;m sorry , but we cannot afford the lease on the big gym anymore .
great , just great .
look , we have lost some major donors ,
and so until we can replace that revenue ,
we &apos;re just going to have to learn to share .
or if you prefer , we could always ...
cut the wrestling program altogether .
i didn &apos;t think so .
when are they starting the search for the new principal ?
i don &apos;t know , but until then , well , you &apos;re stuck with me .
have a good practice .
guys , come on . it &apos;s our turn .
hey , man . a bunch of us are going to play paintball on saturday .
you want to come ?
uh , just us guys , though . ok ?
yeah , cool . sounds good .
oh , by the way , thank you so much
for helping me out with that end kick .
i just could not figure that out .
no problem .
i just ... i really want to get it right , you know ?
don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re doing great .
really ? i am ?
you &apos;re getting a lot better ...
oh , my god , thanks .
hey , by the way , your roots are showing .
it &apos;s probably time for a touch @-@ up .
oh ! yeah , i was ... i &apos;m going to do that tonight .
cool .
how &apos;d it go today ? doctor , right ?
yeah , you know , as good as could be hoped , i guess .
said brandon &apos;s got about 95 percent function back
and should be playing the piano again before long .
so that good , right ?
yeah , absolutely .
good , good .
i mean , i &apos;d asked him myself ,
but he barely picks up the phone for me anymore .
yeah ? and why &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know .
he probably ... thinks i let him down again .
i mean , he did get beat up right outside my place , stef .
what are you talking about ?
you didn &apos;t know he was coming over .
you can &apos;t seriously blame yourself for being asleep ,
mike . come on .
hey , foster .
no one on 17th has seen her .
ok , thanks . i appreciate you asking around for me .
sure thing .
what are you doing ? why are you looking for ana ?
it makes me nervous , not knowing where she is .
i don &apos;t want her showing up out of nowhere ,
getting in touch with the twins or brandon or something .
after what happened last time ,
i just want to know where she is , ok ?
no , stef . no , it &apos;s not ok .
i mean , she &apos;s gone .
just , can &apos;t you leave well enough alone ?
what ? do you really want to invite that mess back into our lives ?
and what if captain roberts
or the da find out you &apos;re looking for her ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s going to look a little suspicious ?
they &apos;re not going to find out .
how do you know ?
just leave it alone , stef , ok ? just leave it alone .
so ? you all cleared to play again ?
yeah , yeah . they say i &apos;m close to 100 percent .
that &apos;s great .
yeah , i was worried things weren &apos;t going to work out
when i came to see you in the hospital .
how about you ? how was everything at court ?
we all cleared for take off ?
uh , no . we &apos;re not , yet .
yeah , they won &apos;t let me get adopted
until we find robert quinn or until i turn 18 .
what ? you &apos;re kidding ?
uh , are you going to look for him then ?
no , i don &apos;t think so .
eighteen &apos;s not that far away ,
and it &apos;s just a piece of paper , right ?
i &apos;m already a member of the family .
yeah , yeah . of course .
so we wait a couple years ,
then we won &apos;t need anyone &apos;s permission .
right .
oh , crap . wyatt &apos;s going to be here like any second .
i got to change . can you ...
would you mind letting him in ?
yeah , sure .
come on in .
so how &apos;s the hand ?
oh , good as new .
at least that &apos;s what they &apos;re telling me , so ...
callie &apos;s changing .
cool , thanks .
sorry about that stupid judge . how &apos;d jude take it ?
he was pretty upset ,
but he definitely understands
why i don &apos;t want to find this robert guy .
he does ? i &apos;m not sure i do .
look , there &apos;s got to be a reason
my mom didn &apos;t want me to know about him .
and i &apos;m not sure i can handle any more surprises .
i think i &apos;ve had enough of those for like ten lifetimes .
i feel you , girl .
i just don &apos;t think i can open up another door ,
without knowing what &apos;s behind it .
for once , i just want to ... play it safe .
daphne , you got a customer .
you sure you &apos;re ok ?
you sure ?
would you be better if i kissed you ?
that &apos;s cheesy !
but would you ?
totally .
oh come on , y &apos;all . people tryin &apos; to eat around here .
ok , since the math midterm is next week ,
i think we probably need an extra tutoring session .
yeah , probably .
or two , maybe ?
yeah , sure .
what about saturday ? can you do that ?
um , i actually have plans this saturday .
you do ?
we &apos;ve got like a family thing .
oh , ok .
well then we should probably study some more tonight .
i have to go home for dinner , but i &apos;ll come back later .
ok .
ok .
mariana , let &apos;s go . dinner &apos;s ready , everyone &apos;s waiting .
ok , i &apos;ll just be a few minutes . you guys can start without me .
are you ok ? you &apos;re not sick , are you ?
no , no , i &apos;m just ...
i can see .
sweetheart , is it really worth it ?
oh , my gosh , you are so beautiful .
why do you need to do all of this ?
you know you spend hours and hours on it ,
and you &apos;re just damaging your hair , love .
mariana , i miss your old hair .
ok , well , i don &apos;t .
really ?
really , i like it blonde .
ok , how about if we took you to a salon ,
and they got it back to brown ...
no !
be down for dinner in three minutes ,
or i &apos;m going to shave your head .
hey , i think we have to lay down the law with mariana .
this is it . she is completely obsessed with her hair ,
and she &apos;s absolutely ruining it .
i think we need to tell her
that she &apos;s going to go back to brown , and that &apos;s it .
honey , we can &apos;t do that .
why not ? why not ? she &apos;ll get mad ,
and she &apos;ll get over it . what &apos;s she gonna do ?
she &apos;s not going to just get over it . not the way you think .
it &apos;s hair , come on .
honey , to you it &apos;s hair .
to me and to mariana , it &apos;s more complicated than that .
listen .
when i was a teenager ,
i would &apos;ve given anything to have straight hair and i did .
i spent every last dime that i had , and then some ,
on chemicals and hot irons and frizz ease .
drove my mother crazy because she loved my curls ,
and she would try and try to force me to stop .
but the more she dug in , the more i dug in .
you know , i @-@ i ended up barely speaking to my mother
for the better part of my junior year ,
because it was that important to me .
honey , you got to trust me on this , ok ?
ok .
thank you .
and for the record , i love your curly hair .
thank you .
oh , speak of the devil .
hello , miss thing , nice of you to join us .
come on , you guys ! everybody , it &apos;s dinner time !
well , this is very nice , having everyone together .
yeah , i think we need to have more ...
... of these all @-@ family dinners again .
i &apos;ll get it .
can we make a deal that everyone is home
for tuesdays and thursdays and sundays ?
oh , and don &apos;t forget , you guys .
tomorrow , we have jude &apos;s award ceremony .
you guys don &apos;t have to come .
i &apos;m just reading my dumb essay .
dude , we &apos;re coming .
and excuse me , this is not a dumb essay ,
it is your award @-@ winning essay ...
um , there &apos;s a social worker at the door .
hi , can we help you ?
hi , there . i &apos;m elaine with cdss .
hi , i &apos;m lena , and this is stef . what &apos;s going on ?
well , i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s come to our attention
that your license to foster has expired .
what ?
expired ? we weren &apos;t notified of anything .
we had been told that you
were formalizing and callie and jude &apos;s adoptions ,
and then this afternoon we received notification
that callie &apos;s adoption has been denied ?
well , yes . for now , but ...
well , unfortunately , without a formalized adoption ,
and without a current license to foster ,
i &apos;m sorry , but i &apos;m going to have to take callie from the home .
how could they do this ?
&apos;cause they can . this is how it works .
i know , but ...
honey , i am so sorry .
i can &apos;t believe this . it &apos;s just so wrong .
we thought the adoption would be long over by now .
no , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not .
but i promise you , tomorrow ,
we will get an emergency extension from the judge ,
and you will be back in your bed tomorrow night .
there &apos;s nothing you can do ?
you can &apos;t cut us just a little slack here ?
i &apos;m sorry . i could lose my job .
ok , you ready ?
where &apos;s jude ?
jude , what are you ... what are you doing ?
i &apos;m going with callie .
jude , you don &apos;t have to do that . you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re adopted , it &apos;s all fine now .
i know . i want to .
jude , sweetheart .
you &apos;re no longer a ward of the state , so you ... you can &apos;t go .
hey , listen to me .
it &apos;s going to be fine .
i &apos;m going to be fine .
i &apos;m going to be back before you know it ,
in plenty of time for your big speech at school tomorrow night .
so there &apos;s nothing to worry about , ok ?
ok ?
ok .
i got that .
i &apos;m so sorry about all this .
right ?
and that &apos;s negative three , so ... what &apos;s the root ?
there &apos;s no family thing on saturday .
i &apos;m going to play paintball with the guys .
i see .
what guys ?
from the wrestling team .
are you upset ?
no .
i mean , i wish you didn &apos;t lie to me about it ,
but you know , whatever .
i &apos;m really sorry about that . this won &apos;t happen again .
you &apos;re not mad ?
i &apos;m not mad .
it kind of sucks , but i &apos;m not mad .
look , ever since you and i started dating , well ,
i went from being one of the guys to jesus &apos;s girlfriend .
you &apos;re not just my girlfriend .
it bites .
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t know . everything &apos;s kind of changed .
i know it &apos;s stupid ,
but i feel like i lost all my friends .
and you know i don &apos;t hang out with girls ,
and now that the guys are treating me like a girl , well ...
it just sucks .
so how many homes you been in ?
foster homes , i mean .
oh , um , six , i think ? yeah .
seven , if you count this one .
in how long ?
about six years .
one a year , huh ? that &apos;s too many .
sorry about that . that &apos;s gotta be hard .
not hungry ?
that &apos;s ok . it &apos;s pretty bad anyway .
how about some dessert ? i made cookies .
i was just ... going over it , you know , before i ...
hey , it &apos;s going to be ok .
you may be a little out of practice ,
but you &apos;ll be back to 100 percent before you know it .
yeah i know . i &apos;m ok , mom .
i just wanted to say goodnight , and i love you .
and call your dad , please , he misses you .
uh , did he tell you ...
... that dani &apos;s moving in with him ?
dani &apos;s moving in ? no , he didn &apos;t .
it &apos;s his life ,
though i still don &apos;t understand why he didn &apos;t break up with her ,
but that &apos;s ... none of my business , right ?
he did . the night , you know , the night of the dance .
but then i guess he went out and got a little drunk ...
... pretty loaded , actually ,
and i didn &apos;t know what to do ,
so i ...
... told dani , and she went out and found him .
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
why do you think , mom ?
so , yeah , um ...
he was all messed up .
he &apos;d been in like a bar fight or something ,
and dani went out , found him , cleaned him up ,
and he &apos;s i guess been sober ever since .
so you know now he feels like he can &apos;t stay clean without her .
he was in a fight ? what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . he had like blood on his hands , i guess .
but that &apos;s not really the point , mom .
i feel like it &apos;s my fault .
what ? that he drank ?
well , yeah , and the fact that he &apos;s back together with dani .
b , baby .
you are not responsible for your father ,
or for me or for anyone else .
the only person that you &apos;re responsible for is you .
you need the bathroom again ?
uh , no . i &apos;m fine , thanks .
ok , well , since you &apos;re a , you know , a flight risk ,
and they haven &apos;t got an ankle bracelet on you yet ,
i &apos;m going to have to secure things .
never had anyone go awol on me , and i &apos;m not going to start now .
i &apos;m a light sleeper .
if you need anything during the night ,
just bang on the wall and i &apos;ll come unlock the door .
all right , then ? sleep well . good night .
演唱者 garrison starr &amp; ag
so vico took the plea , two years probation ,
and his parents are sending him to military school .
two years ? are you serious , two years probation ?
he almost killed my son .
i know , i &apos;m sorry ,
but he has no record and a powerhouse attorney .
at least he &apos;ll be out of your life .
excuse me . excuse me , i need to see the judge , please .
he knows you &apos;re here .
so did i just hear coach spears right ?
you &apos;re quitting the team ?
oh , yeah .

yeah .
i just figured wrestling was your thing first .
i can always go back to volleyball , right ?
right . sure .
so you feel pretty good about that ?
about quitting ? yeah , i guess .
ok . good .

well , what do you want me to say ?
i don &apos;t know . thank you ?
thank you ?
for giving up something that you love to make me feel better ?
dumbass ! it &apos;s not your job to take care of me .
if i &apos;m unhappy , that &apos;s on me .
it &apos;s my job to fix it , not yours .
i &apos;m going to talk to the guys , tell them they &apos;re being jerks .
and you are going to be there
there because you are not quitting the team .
much better .
oh , hell . god , i &apos;m sorry .
you were way better than her .
you totally were .
i mean , she only made the team because she &apos;s latin .
they have to have diversity .
they have like quotas or something . it &apos;s school rules .
hey , hey , so ?
the clerk said he left for the day . i &apos;m sorry .
he left ? i &apos;ve been sitting here all day ?
are you kidding me ?
i know , i &apos;m sorry .
so what now ? what ...
unfortunately ...
callie &apos;s going to have to stay in the new foster home for the weekend .
oh , my god .
i know , i feel awful .

i appreciate this is a difficult ...
sir , you cannot honestly tell me that you have to get home ,
when you &apos;re letting callie be ripped out of ours .
do you not understand what is happening to this girl ?
i &apos;m sorry .
sir ?
you need to think very carefully about what you say next .
you &apos;re on thin ice , my dear .
tomorrow , we &apos;ve got chores in the morning ,
and then you &apos;ve got to go to your group , right ?

welcome home .
thank you .
oh , god , i hope that &apos;s the last time i have to say those words .
hi . i am so sorry i didn &apos;t get to see you read your essay .
how &apos;d you do ?
i didn &apos;t do so good .
yeah , you did , jude . you did just fine .
i just ...
without you there , i didn &apos;t ...
even feel like what i was saying was true .
oh , well , i &apos;d like to hear it .
what anchor beach means to me &quot; by jude adams foster .
my first day at anchor beach , i got lost .
getting lost is nothing new to me .
i &apos;ve been to five different schools in seven different grades
and as soon as i learned my way around ,
i would be moved to a different one .
until i came to anchor beach .
this is where i found my forever family .
i think it &apos;s really cool that the symbol of our school is the anchor .
because before i came here i was always lost ,
always drifting from one home to another , one school to another .
but now i have an anchor .
when you &apos;re out in the middle of the ocean ,
you can be washed overboard and lost at sea .
once you have found your way into a harbor and dropped your anchor ,
you &apos;re safe .
so anchor beach is my safe harbor .
being part of a family ,
whether it &apos;s a real one or one like we have here at school ,
means you can be totally yourself , totally honest ,
because you &apos;re safe to do so .
actually , it means you have to be totally honest ,
because that &apos;s what family expects .
i never thought it would happen , but i &apos;m not lost anymore .
hey , callie .
so listen we &apos;ve got 30 days to get re @-@ certified ,
and the honorable judge i @-@ want @-@ a @-@ clean @-@ trail @-@ on @-@ this was not kidding .
yeah , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
i promise you , we &apos;re going to get this taken care of .
wait , but there &apos;s something else .
what ?
i don &apos;t wanna feel like i can just get yanked out of the house
whenever something happens .
i think i need ...
... i need an anchor .
i think we should look for robert quinn ...
演唱者 the pretty reckless
dad ?
yeah .
what are you doing here ?
is dani here ?
no , she &apos;s at an aa meeting
what &apos;s up ?
she &apos;s moving in , huh ?
yeah . how &apos;d you know ?
i , uh , bumped into her .
you really love her ?
yeah , i do .
she saved my life , b.
she &apos;s good for me .
what &apos;s up ? what &apos;s going on ?
you ok ?
i , uh ...
i can &apos;t feel some of my fingers . they &apos;re still numb .
and i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able to play anymore .
have you tried ?
no , but what if i can &apos;t ? i mean ...
piano is ...
like the thing that made me me ,
you know ?
look ...
what am i gonna do if i can &apos;t do it ?
who am i going to be ?
we won &apos;t know until we try , right ? ok ? come on .
i &apos;ve played this ...
a million times , and it &apos;s not supposed to sound like that .
b , you &apos;re just out of practice .
no , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t feel the keys .
i can &apos;t feel them anymore .
can &apos;t play .
look ...
... maybe it &apos;ll come back , you know ? the feeling ?
yeah .
hello ?
hey , stef . it &apos;s marie .
hey , marie . what &apos;s up ? any news ?
as a matter of fact , we found robert quinn ,
and he &apos;s been served with abandonment papers .
