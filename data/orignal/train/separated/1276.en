Excuse me. It's heavy traffic in the Callahan tunnel.
Can you take northern Ave.?
Why are we stopping?
Please track this GPS signal.
Track it. Track it to where I am right now.
No!
Tommy, we're all so proud of you.
You're on your way to bringing back Rizzoli and sons.
Yeah, little brother, you're finally getting it together.
Hey. I told you guys not to worry.
I'm a late bloomer.
We all wish you and Lydia a long and happy life.
And thank you for finally giving ma what she wants.
Mm. Yeah! At least one of my kids are gonna get married!
Oh. Thank you all.
I've felt alone for so long.
Well, now T.J. And I -- we have you.
And we're so lucky.
Okay, good, now you can get busy
and make me more grandchildren.
No. Ma! Come on.
Hey, uh, can you, uh,
give me another bottle of sparkling cider, please?
Thanks.
I'm so relieved that Tommy didn't fall apart
when pop stressed us all out with his visit.
You're gonna lose that.
So you better wear it or put it back in the safe-deposit box.
I guess I should tell Casey before I tell you, but...
I'm doing it, Maura.
Is casey leaving the army?
Yeah.
Oh, come here.
I'm so happy for you.
I've always wanted to buy a triple decker
down by the water and fix it up, you know?
And have 2.5 kids.
Yeah.
Please, don't turn into my mother.
No, it's -- we haven't even talked about it.
Plus, you know what -- there are plenty of couples
who choose to remain childless.
Yeah. I want to plan your engagement shower.
But mom loves planning.
Yeah.
What? You don't like plastic champagne glasses?
Well, you should use flutes
so you don't let the carbonation escape.
It's sparkling cider, Maura.
Well...
Rizzoli.
Yeah. I got to pull you away.
I just got off, sir.
I've got a situation.
A V.I.P.'s been murdered. And grab Frankie.
'Cause with detective Frost on vacation, we're down a man.
Yes, sir.
Where is everybody?
Only Sergeant Korsak and Officer Jenkins?
This is somebody big.
What's going on?
I was on patrol taking an access road,
and I recognized her.
We're lucky it was you.
He called me instead of putting it out on the radio.
Who is she?
Natalie bloomfield.
Wait. Senator Bloomfield's daughter?
Yeah.
I got to call the police commissioner.
Jenkins, make sure nobody comes through.
Yes, sir.
Who has to tell the Senator?
That's above our pay grade.
Looks like a double tap to the back of the head.
Small caliber fid at close range.
.22, maybe. Execution-style.
What? You think we're looking at a hit?
What, Maura? What is it?
Her tongue was cut out.
Man, you don't do that
unless you're making a point.
Was she a rat?
Wait. Wait. Maura, what is that?
Move her sleeve. What is that? A tattoo?
Well, that's odd. It looks like a QR Code.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to open it with an app.
It's a tattoo.
Oh, it looks similar to a matrix bar code,
which can be read by an imaging device.
Nope. It's not opening.
Got a bag of toiletries, clean shirt, underwear.
Frankie, we're close to the airport.
Can you check and see if she's booked on any flights tonight?
Retainers. How old was she?
25.
All right. The governor notified Senator Bloomfield.
Air Force jet's bringing her back from DC.
We should go to her house.
Yeah, the last thing we need
is the media reporting that the Senator is in BPD.
Dr. Isles, I'd like you to go with them.
Yes, sir?
Natalie was booked on four flights tonight.
Going to D.C., Hong Kong, Beijing,
And Casablanca -- all one way.
Why would she be booked on four different flights?
Throw somebody off.
Oh, she was engaged.
I just found the announcement.
Waiman zhang.
American citizen born in Beijing.
Put a BOLO out on him.
Uh, Waiman and Natalie both worked
at the Knowledge Aggregators Group.
What kind of company is that?
Intelligence gatherers.
Are you guessing?
No.
"Knowledge" means intelligence, and aggregators are gatherers.
K.A.G. is a contractor for the NSA.
National security agency?
What did Natalie do for them?
She was a computer engineer.
Passport's here. And this.
Got to be 20 grand.
Natalie was on the run.
Yeah, well, why would a killer leave that?
'Cause something was here
that's more important than that cash.
Empty laptop bags. He was after her computers.
What the hell have we stumbled into?
Chief Deputy Clay Stephens, Department of Homeland Security.
Sergeant-detective Korsak.
Detective Jane Rizzoli.
Dr. Isles, chief medical examiner.
It's nice to meet you.
Does Homeland Security have an interest in this?
Senator Bloomfield is a personal friend.
And we work closely intelligencis.
So you're here unofficially.
Valerie is a grieving mother,
and we want to take as much off her plate as we can.
"We" as in Homeland Security?
This is a very sensitive investigation.
We all understand that.
Then you understand that politics play a role in everything.
There's no place for politics or a jurisdictional tug-of-war
in a murder investigation.
We're not big-footing this. We're here to offer assistance.
I'm unclear how.
'Cause Homeland Security doesn't investigate murders.
We have resources that you cannot imagine.
Did you find the boyfriend?
No, did you?
No, but we will.
How about we keep you in the loop,
and we'll give you access when we can?
I've worked, uh, with federal agencies multiple times.
We're all prepared to cooperate.
Then I'd like for you to wait
until tomorrow to begin the autopsy.
May I ask why?
The senator has requested that a medical examiner
who's a personal friend assist.
He's flying in from California.
I understand.
I'd like to process the clothing
and any other evidence tonight, though.
I'll take you to see the senator now.
Thank you.
The tailor was coming tomorrow to take in Natalie's dress.
She lost 15 pounds over the last two weeks.
Was your daughter under any other kinds of stress?
I mean, besides a wedding.
My daughter was an introvert -- very private.
She didn't say it, but...
Yeah, I think she may have been having wedding jitters.
Uh, what can you tell us about her fiance, Waiman Zhang?
I don't know him well.
But my daughter loved him.
You don't think he had anything to do with this, do you?
Do you know where he is right now?
No.
Senator, our only chance of solving your daughter's murder
is if you are as forthcoming with us as possible.
There were partisan attacks on me
when my daughter announced her engagement.
It was very hard on Natalie.
She didn't want me to respond, but I had to.
What do you mean?
Because her fiance is a naturalized citizen,
there were suggestions that he couldn't be trusted.
What did you think?
If our government had any doubts about Waiman,
he wouldn't have been issued
a top-secret security clearance at K.A.G.
What did Natalie and Waiman do for K.A.G.?
I couldn't tell you.
Their work fell under the national security act.
It seems strange you wouldn't know,
given your position in the senate.
The underlying tenet, particularly now,
with recent leaks, is need-to-know.
I didn't.
You could ask Christopher, though.
Christopher Carnahan.
He's the C.E.O. of K.A.G.?
Yes.
Okay.
He and my late husband were close friends.
He recruited Natalie to work with him.
Senator, when was the last time you heard from natalie?
Just...
"Mom, catching plane." Where was she going?
She frequently went to D.C. for her work.
Senator, we found 22 grand in cash in Natalie's belongings.
That's not possible. She didn't have that kind of money.
She was also booked on four flights --
One to D.C., one to Bangkok, one to hong kong,
And one to Casablanca, all leaving tonight.
I don't understand why.
We believe that your daughter
was possibly fleeing the country.
No.
We'll need to process everything here.
W-we're not logging it in?
This is a very sensitive investigation, Susie.
Once it's logged in, anyone has access to it.
You don't think the NSA is watching us now, right?
Hmm. I wonder.
Well, privacy is an illusion, Susie.
What do you mean?
Well, your telephone and internet records
are all on file with the NSA.
Are you -- are you sure? - Mine, too.
Well, satellites, drones, security cameras,
license-plate cameras, fast-pass lanes.
Yes, privacy is a thing of the past.
Jane's not back yet?
She's still with the senator. Can I help?
Nah, it's Tommy.
I need Jane. He won't listen to me.
Frankie, what is it?
He's in trouble.
He's drinking, Frankie.
No, he's hammered, Maura.
What happened after the engagement party?
Oh, he wouldn't talk to me.
A friend saw him in here and called me.
Ahh! That was good.
Hey, Maura! Want a boilermaker?
No, thank you.
Oh, that's too bad.
I haven't had one of these in three years.
What about you, Francis?
Let me take you home.
Is it bedtime for Francis?
Can I sit down?
You got to drink!
You seem really sad.
No, I'm happy.
Can you tell me what made you so upset?
You know what, Frankie -- you should buy her
a nice glass of '96 chateau lafite.
You still won't have a chance,
but at least you'll impress her if you know your wines.
Shut your mouth. Let's go.
Do you think Maura's gonna go for you?
She's high-class. You're blue-collar.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh, you gonna make me?!
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.
I'm gonna make you, you little punk.
Yeah?
Frankie, wait.
Stop. Stop, stop. Wait.
Maura, I got it!
Just wait. Just wait.
No, tommy! Don't! Tommy!
No!
Frankie, stop him!
Relax.
Get off me!
Tommy! Tommy.
Get off me!
Relax. Relax.
Want half? It's tuna.
No, thank you.
It's been refrigerated.
No, it's just my stomach's been bad all day.
There's nothing on the boyfriend.
I got officers staked out at his apartment.
You wearing a ring?
And you call yourself a detective.
Yeah, had it on all night.
So when do we start calling you Mrs.?
As soon as Casey gets home.
Retiring after 20 years in the army?
Within reach of making general?
He must really love you.
Nah, he just misses Boston.
Okay, so, Natalie was murdered trying to flee
to one of three places that do not have
extradition treaties with the U.S.
What's your feeling on the senator?
Any chance she's behind this?
Pretty cold to kill your kid,
even if she was about to leak top-secret intel.
Well, unless your kid's a female Edward Snown.
I don't care how powerful she is.
If she did it, we're gonna get her.
Did we check if the boyfriend hopped on a plane?
Oh, yeah. He didn't. Unless he had a fake passport.
We put him on a watch list.
Can't hide forever.
We got Natalie Bloomfield's phone records.
She really was an introvert.
Only one or two calls a day for the past two weeks.
What about before that?
Good thought, Jane. A lot more.
She changed her habits. She was using a burn phone.
Well, Natalie must have thought she was under surveillance.
Makes sense if she was about to leak intelligence.
We're gonna need warrants
for Natalie's apartment and office.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just trying to decide whether I'm better off
waking up judge Walters or judge Steinberg.
Go with Steinberg.
Any press reporting this yet?
No. Senator's office hasn't released anything.
Hey, Maura.
I'm at work.
Okay. Yeah, no, no.
It's -- it's fi-- I'll be right there.
Okay. Okay.
Everything okay?
I'm not sure.
Then go find out. We can pick this up in the morning.
Thanks, boss.
Frankie, you really should have a plastic surgeon look at this.
It's a lip. Just stitch it up.
Wipe your nose. Put this on your eye.
I don't have any lidocaine.
I was a hockey player.
It only hurts when it's a compound fracture.
Just do it fast.
This must be very painful.
I don't want the ice, ma.
You're amazing.
He's a dick.
Watch your language!
What happened?
Ask him.
Shut up. Don't talk to me.
Don't talk to your brother like that!
I just rushed here in the middle of a huge case.
Somebody better tell me what the hell's going on.
Tommy was drinking.
Oh. Thanks a lot, Maura.
He was shit-faced.
Tommy. Why?
'cause I felt like it.
You've been sober for three years, okay?
What happened?
Lydia left me.
Oh, my god. I knew she was no good.
I'm the one who's no good, ma.
Tommy...
Talk.
You started drinking again.
That's why Lydia left you, isn't it?
Is it?
Yeah.
Oh, my god. Just as everything was going good?
Why did you drink?
Pop's cancer scare just knocked me on my ass.
I fell off the wagon.
Lydia said she didn't want to live with a drunk.
Where's Lydia?
Tommy.
Where did she take T.J.?
I don't know!
Well, it's not Boston Joe's,
but it's drinkable, Jane.
Well, it's hard to tell,
but I found evidence of recent hair loss.
How recent?
Natalie's mother said that she dropped
a bunch of weight in the last couple of weeks.
Within that time frame.
She showed additional signs of potential stress,
including bruxism.
I know what that is because I ground my teeth
for at least three hours last night.
I couldn't sleep, either.
And it's not just my idiot brother
and my missing nephew and this poor dead girl
that kept me awake.
Don't think about planning a wedding now, Jane.
No, it's not that.
We're gonna do it at the justice of the peace.
I just keep worrying that something's gonna happen
to him in the last weeks when he's in Afghanistan.
Don't think negative thoughts.
Your body will experience something
that isn't even happening.
Yeah.
Damn it.
What's the matter?
The Judge denied the warrant for Natalie's office.
Korsak thinks the feds intervened.
"Still waiting to see if the judge
will sign the warrant for her apartment."
It's out.
All the national news crews are in town.
How much do they know?
No details on the shooting yet,
but they're digging into Natalie and Waiman's
top-secret security clearances.
It's only a matter of time before they start to speculate
that natalie was killed to keep her from leaking secrets.
Hmm. How's your lip?
Good. I had a great plastic surgeon.
You want some coffee?
Love some.
Good. Stay have a cup.
Tommy still in your apartment?
Think so. The bars don't open till 11:00.
Not funny.
Well...
I would like to take a look at your lip, if you don't mind,
to make sure that there are no signs of infection.
Okay?
Oh, it looks good.
No swelling, no redness.
Does that hurt?
No.
Hmm. You sure?
Forgot my keys.
Actually, I don't have time for coffee. See you at work.
Okay, what's going on between you two?
He is a -- a very kind and a very good person.
Well, since you and I don't have time
for a touchy-feely download, can you just tell me,
Are you planning to see my brother naked?
Jane, I don't want to talk about this with you right now.
You may not know this, but that one --
when he falls, he falls hard.
So you can't mess with his heart, okay?
Uh, I don't think our badges are gonna do too well here.
I can talk my way in anywhere.
Well, then, you do the talking, James Bond.
Do you know how many private security companies
work for the NSA?
About 2,000. - Bet you don't know this --
There are half a million non-government workers
with top-secret security clearance.
Like Natalie Bloomfield.
Do you know how many government agencies
there are conducting intelligence activities?
16.
We got the C.I.A., D.I.A.,
NSA, NGA,
NRO, AFISRA,
INSCOM, MCIA,
O.N.I, O.I.C.I.,
INR, CGI, FBI,
D.E.A./O.N.S.I., INR,
and TFI.
That's very impressive. Now breathe.
Ah, I think they would have killed Snowden
if they'd been able to catch him.
I think you've been watching too many movies.
Yeah, me, too.
And, Frankie, Feds don't cut out tongues.
Yeah, what about as a warning to other hackers and leakers?
I don't think so.
But, you know, private intelligent companies
are stacked with ex-C.I.A. And special-ops guys.
The hit was slick. Phew!
Sorry, Sergeant Korsak,
I'm gonna have to turn you around.
Hey, you know my name!
Back up the line.
Could you let Christopher Carnahan know we're here?
This one's turning around.
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
I don't think he's listening to you.
Oh, well, Homeland Security
didn't have any trouble getting in.
I thought you agreed to keep us in the loop.
It looks like you don't need any help staying in the loops.
And in order for us to share, we have to investigate.
We need to get into Natalie's office.
You don't have a warrant to search it.
Thanks to you.
We just need to speak to Natalie's boss, okay?
Look -- you're the one that said
you were friends with her mother.
If that's true, then help us find her killer.
Christopher, it's good to see you.
You, too, Clay. What a tragedy.
How's Valerie?
Not good.
These are detectives investigating Natalie's murder?
Christopher Carnahan, C.E.O., Knowledge Aggregators Group.
How can I help you?
You can tell us what Natalie was working on.
Natalie was a key member
of our cryptography and computer-security section.
It's important that we know what she was doing
in the hours leading up to her death.
Anything you can tell us might help.
Nothing out of the routine.
You know where she was going last night?
Yeah, she left here about 7:00 p.m.
She went to Logan to fly to D.C. for a morning security briefing.
How did she get there?
Our internal car service.
Can you check your records and find out who drove her there?
I can check right here.
Well, this is strange. She canceled the car.
We think it's possible Natalie may have been
about to leak some intelligence.
I can't believe that. Not Natalie.
What evidence do you have of that?
She booked one-way flights
to countries without extradition treaties,
and we believe she took two laptops with her from K.A.G.
We'll do a full internal audit.
This game just changed.
This is now a matter of national security.
The missing computers are a matter of national security.
Natalie's homicide is still of concern to us.
We'll see about that.
They're gonna put up a wall we won't be able to get around.
What if one of those
16 government agencies killed Natalie?
What? Security cameras can't read my lips.
We're running out of time.
Hey, Maura, start that autopsy.
I can't, Jane.
I'm still waiting for the medical examiner
that the senator sent.
Okay, the homeland security guy
just said that he would like for you to wait.
That's not an official-official.
That's a courtesy.
I don't like where this conversation is headed.
Well, you're gonna like this even less.
You're about to lose that body.
What? How do you know that?
I'm a good guesser.
Jane, I can't cut her body.
Well, you better do everything but
because it's all we've got.
Come on. Come on.
How long has it been?
1 minute and 46 seconds.
All right, close enough.
We're here to take custody of Natalie Bloomfield's body
and any and all evidence you've collected.
I don't see any men in black suits anywhere.
Maybe we can find a way to see into Natalie's apartment.
We may not have to. The judge just signed a warrant.
Nice.
What happened?
Well, the Feds paid us a visit.
Oh, well, I feel so much more secure, don't you?
They took my computer. I had personal photos.
They took everything, even my handwritten notes.
Hey, Vince. How would you like Detective King's computer?
That looks just like my computer.
Yeah, well, I swapped his out with yours,
And they took his.
You didn't happen to save mine, did you?
Why don't you try this one?
You know you can get in a lot of trouble for this.
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
Is there any news on this boyfriend?
Nothing.
But why don't we go over what we know about Natalie?
Right, she was, uh -- she was stressed out.
She was losing weight. She wasn't using her cellphone.
Korsak, do you still have her phone records?
Yeah.
Who did she call two weeks ago
right before she stopped using that phone?
The office, boyfriend.
Wait. What's this 800 number?
Reservation desk of the Logan Convention Center and Hotel.
Well, what was going on there?
Three-day Government Intelligence Community Conference.
Looks like 1,500 private and government
intelligence experts attended.
Check the cellphone towers near that hotel.
Maybe she stayed there.
Yeah, she was within range of their towers for all three days.
Maybe something happened at that hotel during the conference.
Or maybe she met someone
and decided to leak or sell intelligence.
Senator Bloomfield's giving a press conference.
Some claim that my daughter was about
to divulge sensitive intelligence information.
Well, she got out in front of it.
The media must have been about to break it.
There could only be one explanation --
She was influenced by her fiance, Waiman Zhang.
Maybe she knows something we don't.
Hey. Come on.
Maura says she's got something.
Susie, is anybody there?
No, dr. Isles.
All right, this is a dental mold of Natalie's teeth.
Mm, making a dental mold is a federal offense.
What?!
Susie, I told you I will take
full responsibility for obstructing justice.
What did you do?
Uh, well, Susie, check again.
No one's coming, doctor, but please hurry.
Yes, doctor, please.
I can't stare at a dental mold much longer.
You palmed Natalie's retainers.
Well, I, um -- they, um -- yes.
Okay, that actually is obstructing justice.
Oh, boy.
May I ask why?
And why we're gathered here staring at dental contraband?
This is Natalie's maxillary upper and her mandibular lower.
She had active orthodontic treatment as a teenager.
Watch this.
Doesn't fit.
Are you sure those are Natalie's?
Yes. Uh, her alignment has relapsed.
So Natalie didn't wear them.
How long had it been since she did?
Years -- two to three, at least.
But we found them with her in her briefcase.
Why would you take retainers that don't fit?
You wouldn't.
She didn't pack them. Somebody else did.
Not the boyfriend. He'd know she didn't wear them.
Maura, this is great.
Okay, we got to get into Natalie's apartment.
Why? What will that tell you?
If somebody else packed her things,
that somebody was in the apartment.
Mm-hmm, and if we're right,
then Natalie wasn't running, she was set up.
How do we get past the feds?
We're gonna need help.
Senator, what we have to tell you about your daughter
is not something that you want
the Department of Homeland Security to hear.
Well, if it's a question of national security --
It isn't. It's of a personal nature.
Clay, can you give us a minute?
We believe your daughter was framed.
Natalie's retainers were found with her body.
I was able to determine that she wasn't --
Yeah, no, I...
Oh, god.
And I blamed Waiman.
We had a little joke.
I told her for college graduation,
I was giving her braces again
because she never wore the damn retainers.
I knew it.
I knew she would never betray her country.
Then help us prove that.
You can't do this, Valerie.
I am a senior senator of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
This warrant was issued by a state judge.
A federal judge can block it.
Are you gonna tell them to move?
Come on, Senator.
Unless you'd like to be on national news
arresting a U.S. Senator.
And the Chief Medical Examiner
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
And three Boston Homicide detectives.
Excuse us.
If I know Clay, he's already working
on a federal court order to get us out of here.
I'll see what I can do to slow him down.
Let's hope the feds missed something.
See anything on the lock?
Scratches on the tumbler. It's been picked.
Well, that doesn't sound very high tech for government spooks.
Google glasses still won't let you pass through walls.
Interesting. She was a knitter.
Maura, we brought you here
because we couldn't bring CSRU, remember?
Found a needle in a pencil eraser
with stained-black thread.
India ink.
And a permanent marker.
Ink? What? Like making a tattoo?
Hmm, these are all supplies that could be used to
make a homemade tattoo.
Natalie's wrist.
The ink is consistent with the ink that was used on her tattoo.
Frank, you took a picture of it, right?
Yeah.
I mean, why would Natalie give herself a homemade tattoo?
Well, it's a unique design?
Wow. That's weird. Hmm?
I don't have any cell service in here.
Yeah. Me, either.
And I don't have google.
The kids these days are calling it "Wi-Fi."
Why would a computer-engineer genius like Natalie
live in a place without cell service?
Yeah, and no 25-year-old I know
has an old-school phone.
Old-school? It's cordless.
You guys don't have those at home?
No. Kids use these.
Ha ha ha, you people think you're so funny.
A 2.4 gigahertz signal would override the router.
Check to see if you have cell service and Wi-Fi now.
Yeah, it's back up.
So Natalie made a homemade Wi-Fi jammer.
She was under surveillance.
And what do you do when you're under surveillance?
You don't use electronic devices.
You go old-school.
All right, so, what did the feds miss?
What's still here that could help us?
"Pick up dry cleaning. Get fruit.
Go to bank and deposit check."
Okay, even I direct-deposit.
Yeah, so does she. I checked her bank records.
Why else would you go to the bank?
Did you check to see if she was paying for a safe-deposit box?
Yeah, she wasn't.
I'm such a good customer,
my gold card gives me one for free.
Did she have a credit card through her bank?
Yeah.
So maybe she had a free safe-deposit box.
No payment record. You wouldn't be able to trace it.
Exactly.
Two red NSA badges.
The scarlet letter.
Red means you're about to lose your security clearance.
So someone's threatening Natalie and her fiance.
Yeah, her mother, too. Look at this.
"Kick Bloomfield out of Washington."
Laundry bag from the Logan Convention Center and Hotel.
Where natalie spent three days. What's that?
Bloody wash rag.
Bodily fluid?
It's definitely semen, but it wasn't her fiance's.
It was a different blood type.
The blood on the washcloth is A.B.
A.B.? So the blood is Natalie's?
She was grinding her teeth, losing her hair, not eating.
What's that sound like to you?
Add blood and semen, sounds like she was raped.
Yeah, the washcloth is from
the Logan Convention Center and Hotel.
I think she was raped there.
If Natalie was raped at a security conference,
why not report it?
A-and why save the washcloth? Why not her clothing?
Maybe he took her clothes
and made her shower in front of him.
He was just as careful and efficient
at raping her as he was at killing her.
Rizzoli.
What? Where?
Okay, thanks.
Waiman Zhang just turned himself in.
The boyfriend? To the feds?
To us.
Why did you disappear?
Natalie sent me this text.
"Plan 'X'"?
This is gonna sound like something out of
"the Bourne Identity."
Try us.
We were at a conference, and something happened there.
The security conference at Logan Center?
Yeah.
What were you doing there?
All the K.A.G. people were there.
I was only there the first day.
Natalie was there the whole weekend.
And when I picked her up, she was different.
Different? How?
She was really quiet, but more than usual.
Yeah. She wouldn't talk to me.
And she was just crying all the time.
And that wasn't like her.
You were her fiance.
You must have had some idea of what was upsetting her.
I tried to get it out of her,
but she said that if I knew that I would be at risk, too.
Let's go back to "Plan 'X'."
What we do for a living would make anybody paranoid.
Natalie thought that we should have a plan
just in case we needed to disappear.
Plan "X."
Yeah.
Um, could we see your tattoo?
Natalie did that. She had one, too.
Frankie.
No, I tried. It doesn't open.
I have another idea.
It's opening.
It's an encrypted link to the deep web.
I don't even want to know what that is.
My name is Natalie Bloomfield.
And if you've accessed this, it means you have my body.
I pray Waiman is still alive.
I'm sorry, but as you know,
your state warrant is invalid
because this is a matter of national security.
Oh, shoot. Wrong one.
Clay, do you have the other one?
Right here.
Thank you.
You were helping us the whole time, weren't you?
Oh, I can do a lot of things.
But I can't investigate a homicide.
That one's federal.
You thought you could hide behind national security,
do whatever you wanted in your private company?
You sought out introverted women,
didn't think any of them would ever stand up to you.
Clay, this is an abuse of power. What is going on here?
How did you do it?
How'd you get Natalie into your hotel suite?
What? Did you tell her you had some work to go over?
As a standard, we use cryptographic interoperability
on this D.O.D. classified document.
But, um, I added this algorithm.
She'd known you forever. You were like a father to her.
And her boss.
She didn't even see it coming, did she?
Saw what? What are you implying, detective?
No. Please. Please!
Please! Please stop!
It was consensual sex!
Are you sure? That's not what Natalie said.
My boss, Christopher Carnaha, raped me.
He has me under surveillance,
even though he thinks he got away with it,
just as he has dozens of times before.
But he knows that I found others.
You were spying on her to make sure she wasn't talking.
And that's when you learned
she'd found the other women you'd raped.
They're just as afraid as I am.
But I cannot, in good conscience,
go on with my life
and allow him to rape another woman.
You framed her and you killed her,
you piece of crap.
Clay, please.
The fact that I had sex with Natalie
does not mean that I killed her.
No. No, it doesn't.
But this does.
Please track this GPS signal.
It's Christopher.
He's got a GPS jammer on his phone,
but I think I've got it.
Track it. Track it to where I am right now!
We tracked your phone right to Natalie's body.
It cost her her life, but she beat you.
You're under arrest
for the murder of Natalie Bloomfield.
Don't play with your sutures.
Where did you come from?
How's your lip?
It's fine.
You want to see how fine?
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to see what that felt like.
I'm gonna go before we have an awkward conversation.
Jane.
What are you doing?
Read it.
"I wasn't expecting this to be so hard.
I don't know who I am if I'm not a soldier.
They want me to command a battalion in the Balkans.
There's room for my wife.
Please come, Jane. Please."
I'm not going.
I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, me, too.
I'm not gonna leave everything
to follow him around the world.
What's in your hand?
I think I'm pregnant.
