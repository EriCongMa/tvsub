so , we &apos;re about to shoot this scene in the movie
where the killer ape dna is slowly taking over my body .
okay .
but i realize they &apos;re gluing fur everywhere ,
except my cleavage .
so , i asked the director why
and he says , it &apos;s important to the story that my boobs
be the last things to turn ape .
it &apos;s sweet that he thinks there is a story .
oh , and there &apos;s not even a bathroom on set .
i have to go to the gas station across the street .
i mean , i was dressed like half an ape
and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there .
leonard , i could use your assistance .
sure . what &apos;s up ?
well , now that i &apos;ve given up string theory ,
i &apos;m struggling to find my next area of focus .
so , in your professional opinion ,
which of these areas do you think is the most promising ?
huh , well , i @-@ i think there &apos;s some really innovative stuff
going on in dark matter .
that &apos;s helpful .
okay . of these four areas ...
sheldon !
what did we say about being a nicer friend ?
thank you .
lenard , what did we say about being a gullible weenie ?
it is just so frustrating .
&apos;cause you &apos;re trying too hard .
you need to do something else . get your mind off it .
hey . how about we bring back anything can happen thursdays ?
hey , that &apos;s good . why &apos;d you guys stop doing that ?
you made fun of us . said it was stupid .
yeah . sounds like me .
come on , sheldon . what do you say ?
all right .
i officially reinstate anything can happen thursday .
great ! what do you want to do ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you want to do ?
i don &apos;t know .
what do you want to do ?
i &apos;m starting to remember the problem with
anything can happen thursdays .
what could we do that &apos;s fun ?
what could we do that &apos;s different ?
what could we do that &apos;s free ?
got it ! we order a pizza .
are you kidding ? that &apos;s what you always do .
think harder .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
got it !
we order calzones , cut them open ,
eat them like pizza .
all right ! all right !
i &apos;ll shake the brain bush one more time , see what falls out .
got it !
there &apos;s a live @-@ action role @-@ playing group
that meets every thursday night in griffith park
and reenacts battles from lord of the rings .
uh , tell me more about this calzone idea .
you know what ? why don &apos;t we just ease into this .
let @-@ let &apos;s go for a walk
and @-@ and @-@ and see if we find a new restaurant .
any chance that restaurant is near griffith park ?
no .
all right .
raj and howard are at howard &apos;s mom &apos;s ,
but should we call the girls and see if they want to come ?
no . bernadette &apos;s working late .
amy &apos;s sick .
aw . what &apos;s wrong with her ?
well , she talks a lot .
she always wants to hold hands .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
well , if you were referring to her illness
your question should have been , &quot; what ails her ? &quot;
&quot; what ails her ? &quot;
oh . who knows ?
come on , anything can happen .
we can push him down the stairs !
hey . thanks for coming to hang out .
no problem . how &apos;s your mom feeling ?
okay , but she &apos;d feel better if she took her medicine .
you know , when cinnamon won &apos;t take her medicine ,
i hide it in a piece of cheese .
good idea . we can wrap the pill in cheese ,
feed it to cinnamon ,
and then my mom can eat cinnamon .
what do you feel like doing ?
i was thinking we could watch a dvd .
well , my mom doesn &apos;t have a lot to choose from .
unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy .
spoiler alert : 20 minutes in , they find a prune pit .
actually , how do you feel about watching house of 1000 corpses ?
a straight @-@ up gore @-@ fest ? you hate this stuff .
i do , but for some reason , emily loves it
and wants to watch it with me tomorrow , so ...
i thought if i start with you first ,
then i could act cool about it with her .
that &apos;s actually not a bad plan .
i can sit through the colonoscopy now ,
but that first time i was like ,
&quot; oh , my god , a prune pit ! &quot;
uh , so ... you &apos;d watch it ?
sure .
you &apos;re a good friend . i owe you one .
howard !
help me get out of the tub !
not that one .
so , we &apos;re just randomly choosing a restaurant
without researching it online ?
yep .
great .
you know , this is how anything can happen thursday turns into
it won &apos;t stop coming up friday .
hey , how about that asian fusion place ?
fusion and asians ?
i &apos;m trying not to think about science .
what the hell ?
what ... ?
she &apos;s not working late !
and amy doesn &apos;t look sick .
why would they lie to us ?
that &apos;s a good question .
amy and bernadette .
amy and bernadette .
amy and bernadette .
why did you lie to us ? !
hey . listen to this :
&quot; murder ... cannibalism and satanic rituals
are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await . &quot;
i just helped my mom out of the tub ,
so , i &apos;m one slippery horror ahead of you .
you &apos;re a good son .
i don &apos;t know how you do it .
beach blankets , my friend .
it &apos;s all about beach blankets .
all right , let &apos;s get this over with .
ew , it &apos;s got someone &apos;s hair on it !
oh , yeah , you &apos;re gonna do great with this movie .
you &apos;re not working late . why did you lie to me ?
and amy , you told me you were sick ,
but you look just as pale and tired as always .
i &apos;m sorry . i just needed a break
from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory .
and we kind of just wanted one night
where we didn &apos;t have to hear about
how miserable you are making this movie .
but none of that means we don &apos;t love you .
i haven &apos;t been complaining that much about the movie .
have i ?
i also love you .
you know what ?
maybe i need a break from all of you .
come on , sheldon .
where are we going ?
we &apos;re gonna have anything can happen thursday ,
you &apos;re gonna tell me all about your science stuff
and i &apos;m gonna complain about my movie ,
and we &apos;re gonna support each other
because that &apos;s what friends do .
okay .
&apos;cause if i had to pick now ,
i &apos;d probably go with dark matter because ...
shut up .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i don &apos;t understand my food .
chinese noodles with korean barbecue ...
in a taco .
it &apos;s fusion .
well , my mother would lock her car doors
if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity .
think i &apos;ve been complaining too much about the movie ?
not at all .
thank you .
but to be fair , when you talk ,
most of what you say sounds like ,
&quot; wah , wah , wah , clothes . &quot;
hey , i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re not upset with amy .
i am .
so much so that i &apos;m gonna bring her here
for dinner on our next date night .
okay .
so , in the last 20 minutes ,
we &apos;ve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar .
we &apos;ve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish .
and the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken by my mother .
on the bright side , she didn &apos;t even notice the pill .
why does emily like this stuff ?
do you think there &apos;s something psychologically wrong with her ?
what difference does it make ?
what do you mean ?
oh , come on--
she could have a freezer full of ex @-@ boyfriend &apos;s body parts
and you &apos;d still go out with her .
i do like that the ex @-@ boyfriend &apos;s out of the picture .
i feel so bad about lying to sheldon .
how am i gonna make it up to him ?
i &apos;d tell you what i do with howard ,
but i don &apos;t think dressing up like a catholic schoolgirl
is gonna work with sheldon .
he &apos;d probably give you homework .
did you lie to howard about tonight ?
of course .
and you don &apos;t feel guilty about it ?
between penny &apos;s gorilla movie
and howard &apos;s gorilla mother , i had no choice .
thankfully penny and i have a relationship based on honesty .
what ? i don &apos;t lie to her .
oh , we know you don &apos;t lie to her .
thank you .
hey , maybe the answer to your career question
is in one of these .
penny , there &apos;s only one cookie with something
in the middle that solves life &apos;s problems ,
and that &apos;s an oreo .
or a nutter butter , if you &apos;re in a pinch .
come on , open it . i bet it says something great .
this is asian fusion .
for all you know , there &apos;s a tiny chihuahua in here .
fine , i &apos;ll go .
&quot; people turn to you for guidance and wisdom . &quot;
yeah , that &apos;s a good one .
no , it &apos;s not .
how is that not good ?
&quot; turn to you for wisdom &quot; ?
clearly , that cookie is mocking you .
you &apos;d never hear that kind of sass from a nutter butter .
uh , since you &apos;re paying for dinner , i &apos;ll let that slide .
open yours .
have you ever paid for a meal ?
not with money . read .
&quot; your warm and fun @-@ loving nature delights those around you . &quot;
oh , try again .
let me get this straight .
so , he kills this girl &apos;s father ,
cuts off the guy &apos;s face ,
and is wearing it as a mask
while he makes out with her .
i &apos;m just gonna say it .
that &apos;s not okay .
why can &apos;t i be in a relationship
with a girl who likes the sound of music ?
raj , you are the girl in the relationship
who likes the sound of music .
hey , penny . what &apos;s up ?
no , bernie &apos;s working late .
really ?
thanks for telling me .
what ?
i &apos;m having sex with a catholic schoolgirl tonight .
oh , i think i see our next stop .
you can &apos;t be serious .
if i wanted to waste my time on nonsense ,
i &apos;d follow leonard on instagram .
no , come on-- tonight , we are trying new things .
oh ! that &apos;s a lot of incense .
or someone set a hippie on fire .
yeah , honey , i &apos;m still stuck at work .
really ?
penny said that ?
okay , it &apos;s true . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll see you at home .
yeah , yeah , i &apos;ll put it on .
you and i never just hang out like this .
why is that ?
i know , it &apos;s weird , right ?
yeah .
we should do it more often .
oh , no . i mean , this is weird right now .
ah , it &apos;s penny .
is she still mad ?
oh , doesn &apos;t seem like it .
she got sheldon to go to a psychic with her .
a psychic ?
he considers them not just mumbo jumbo ,
but extra @-@ jumbo mumbo jumbo .
well , penny can be pretty persuasive .
she &apos;s gotten me to do a lot of things i wouldn &apos;t normally do .
because she has sex with you .
yeah , she does .
can i confess something ?
once in a while , i get a little jealous
of how close penny and sheldon are .
really ?
i mean , not in a romantic way .
it &apos;s just , she really has some sort of connection with him .
well ... well , they &apos;ve known each other a long time ,
and penny grew up around horses ,
so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish .
don &apos;t get me wrong . i &apos;m glad they &apos;re friends .
i just wish he &apos;d be that comfortable around me already .
well , it took him a long time to get comfortable around me , too .
really ? what did you do ?
something terrible in a former life ? i don &apos;t know .
i gotta go .
penny ratted me out .
fyi , she &apos;s getting you a watch for your birthday
with money she took out of your wallet .
i don &apos;t mean to be rude or discourteous ,
but before we begin , i &apos;d just like to say
there is absolutely no scientific evidence
to support clairvoyance of any kind .
which means--
and again , no insult intended--
but you &apos;re a fraud ...
... your profession is a swindle ,
and , uh , your livelihood is dependent
on the gullibility of stupid people .
again , no offense .
all right , sheldon , just ask your question .
okay , i just did . what was it ?
oh , for god &apos;s sake .
look , he &apos;s a physicist who &apos;s trying to figure out
what his next field of study should be .
for your information ,
i was asking her about the next star trek movie .
okay , i can answer that one : i &apos;ll be bored .
all right , why don &apos;t we begin ?
your spirit guides are telling me that
there &apos;s a woman in your life you &apos;re having problems with .
that &apos;s an easy guess .
i &apos;m clearly an annoying person
and have problems with both genders .
yes , you clearly are .
but i &apos;m seeing a specific woman
that you &apos;re in a romantic relationship with .
oh , oh , here we go .
does she have dark hair ?
yes ! yes ! your spirit guides are on fire !
the majority of people have dark hair .
even you , at one time .
does she work in a similar field to you ?
ha ! the opposite .
she &apos;s a neurobiologist , and i &apos;m a theoretical physicist .
my spirit guides can go suck an egg .
they &apos;re telling me that
you have difficulty being close with her .
oh , he does . he so does .
what should he do ?
he should give himself to this relationship .
once he does ,
all his other pursuits will come into focus .
sheldon , do you hear that ?
i mean , amy is the key to your happiness .
exactly .
personally and professionally .
everything will fall into place once you commit to her .
you know what this is ?
yeah , and i reserve this word for those rare instances
when it &apos;s truly deserved .
this is malarkey !
wow , you really struck a nerve .
i &apos;ve never heard him use the &quot; m &quot; word before .
here we go :
house of a 1,000 corpses .
now , just so you know ,
i was a nanny for three years , so if you get scared ,
i can totally change your diaper .
actually , i have to tell you something .
these kind of movies really aren &apos;t my thing ,
so , last night , i watched it
just to see what i was getting myself into .
okay .
and i have to be honest--
i thought it was disturbing and weird ,
and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it .
i wonder that , too .
then , why do you watch these things ?
can i tell you something without you judging me ?
sure .
they kind of turn me on .
and play .
hello .
i didn &apos;t expect you this evening .
well , i was just feeling so bad
about lying to you the other night ,
i wanted to make it up to you .
and how do you propose to do that ?
unless you have gravity on blu @-@ ray under that skirt ,
i don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going with this .
