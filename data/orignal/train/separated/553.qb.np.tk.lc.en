shirley , did you ever date roger ebert ?
excuse me ?
nothing .
britta , did you ever take pictures of your feet
and post them on the internet for money ?
sha @-@ ha ! no .
guys , this history final is going to be killer .
we have to study .
it &apos;s no fair professor cornwallis
turned all hard @-@ assed again .
lucky pierce .
donating his kidney to gilbert to get out of it .
i never thought he &apos;d be that generous .
although , he did seem disappointed
that the operation didn &apos;t involve sleeping with a russian woman ,
then waking up in a bathtub full of ice .
guys !
history !
i am studying history .
i &apos;m studying our history .
abed !
nobody bite .
we agreed no biting .
but , jeff , it &apos;s a graduation gift .
you see , on the surface we seem like just a group of people
from diverse backgrounds who have become unlikely friends .
but according to my research ,
our paths have crossed many times .
we were destined to meet .
like a team of superheroes .
this is our origin story .
and here ... we ... go .
abed , we don &apos;t have origin stories .
we have lives .
well , at least ...
yep , just me .
so you &apos;re saying we &apos;re all connected
like the classic french film trilogy
bleu , blanc , rouge ?
no , like something more accessible .
like unbreakable .
abed , i know it &apos;s disappointing to you ,
but we &apos;re not superheroes .
this is the real world , not some comic book adventure .
i &apos;ve done it . i &apos;ve infiltrated the school .
i &apos;ve learned its secrets .
i &apos;ve gained everyone &apos;s trust .
and now , on the anniversary of my empire &apos;s destruction ,
vengeance will be mine .
no , vengeance will be ours .
okay , can you stop that ? it really creeps me out .
i &apos;m sorry . just really love this thing .
skymall .
i &apos;ve been doing exhaustive research
into origin of our lives .
once i find the last one or two missing pieces ,
i &apos;ll have conclusive proof that we were all destined to meet .
this is how we &apos;re all connected .
i call it the crazy quilt of destiny
mainly because the loom of fate was already taken .
really ?
look.i don &apos;t care what tricks or nonsense you have
in your scrapbook , martha stewart ,
but there &apos;s no way you &apos;re gonna get me to believe
there &apos;s some outside force controlling my destiny .
and i think you used that particular phrasing
because i know you &apos;ve seen star wars .
everybody &apos;s seen star wars .
yes , but you first saw it when it was re @-@ released in 1982
at the greendale palladium at 4 : 15 in the afternoon .
and it was the best time you ever had with your father .
how did you know that ?
you keep this ticket stub in your wallet .
abed , you can &apos;t ...
give it back !
our story begins in the distant mists of a lost era :
2008 .
i know you &apos;re all wondering how i do it .
how do i balance straight as , extracurriculars ,
and israeli folk dancing every friday night ?
it &apos;s a simple matter of organization ,
dedication , and ...
and we &apos;re back !
then i drink your milkshake .
ah , that will never get old .
you guys gotta see my juno .
hey , troy .
so i heard you weren &apos;t doing that great in algebra ,
and you know , if you need a tutor for math ,
i &apos;d be happy to help .
i &apos;m being recruited by colleges to play football .
i don &apos;t have time for math .
the only thing that matters to me are statistics .
that &apos;s also a type of math .
but we already knew i went to high school with troy ,
and it &apos;s not like he even remembered i existed .
yeah , i don &apos;t remember her at all .
we should probably drop this .
wait , where &apos;s pierce on this chart ?
his contribution to the group has already been noted .
pierce hawthorne . fixture at greendale . unavoidable .
hey , is that a sad face ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
you have to look deeper . here . take this , for example .
it &apos;s a receipt i found in the back
of shirley &apos;s sock drawer on thanksgiving .
you went in my bedroom for some comic book thing ?
oh , no , my feet were cold . ah , here .
you should probably wash those .
discovering the receipt was dumb luck ,
but it proves that we were at the mall
on the exact same day .
shirley , do remember what you bought for $ 54
at the love hut ?
what ? hmm ? no .
so excited about tonight , honey .
uh @-@ huh . it &apos;s been too long
since we had adult time without the kids .
well , i may have an anniversary surprise for you too .
well , i &apos;m in public , but , uh ...
you know you gonna get it , right ?
you gonna get it !
so we were at the mall on the same day .
unbreakable .
mail call .
that &apos;s all right . won &apos;t be needing it today .
but kevin always takes the mail .
well , today &apos;s mail &apos;s kind of important .
it &apos;s the day that i send in greendale &apos;s lease renewal .
lease re @-@ new @-@ al ?
it &apos;s a critical document .
see , greendale sublets our land from the arapaho nation .
miss a renewal and faster than you can say &quot; wounded knee , &quot;
we turn into a casino and midsize concert venue .
so you only trust me with busywork ?
oh , no , that &apos;s not ...
kevin , ah ...
i cannot resist those puppy dog eyes .
here .
ah ! now , i have time to hit the seamstress .
guess all i have to say is &quot; ladies and gentlemen ,
greendale resort and casino presents steve winwood . &quot;
okay , i just need to find the one last smoking gun ,
and i think this might be it .
i found it in a copy of the greendale communist worker .
look familiar ?
oh , my god .
this is me and my anarchist collective at the courthouse .
we called ourselves the an @-@ her @-@ chists .
did you guys know that jeff &apos;s in that photo ?
what !
jeff . my man .
congrats on getting your case thrown out .
your argument was a masterpiece .
i mean , it was definitely creative .
creative ?
he convinced a judge to forgive five years back taxes
by getting him to agree
that you humping an american flag to back in black
was not stripping
but actually not @-@ for @-@ profit performance art .
blew me away .
come on , let &apos;s go !
thank you .
thank you for defending a woman &apos;s right
to use her body however she chooses .
i can honestly say that right is very important to me .
excuse me , mr. winger , can we get a ...
you &apos;re a hero .
hi .
guys !
we have got to capitalize on this momentum .
it is time an @-@ her @-@ chists finally takes a stand
on animals rights .
there is a medical lab in an office building nearby .
next week , i say we break in there ...
actually , we were thinking this is our last hurrah .
but this was our first hurrah .
we &apos;re just getting going .
britta , we &apos;re done .
i had a hamburger the other day ,
and suddenly i &apos;m not cold all the time .
fine . go . i don &apos;t need you .
what &apos;s an anarchist to do without her organization ?
jeffrey , how could you ?
well , i was a really good lawyer .
mysti is the stripper that andre cheated on me with ,
and you defended her .
shirley , i ...
if you hadn &apos;t gotten that homewrecker off ,
andre never would &apos;ve met her .
jeff ends shirley &apos;s marriage .
see ? i told you we were always destined to meet .
i knew shirley and jeff went to the same restaurant ,
but i had no idea their paths crossed again ,
this is good . this is really great .
we &apos;re really filling in some plot holes here .
this is good stuff . it &apos;s really good .
have i missed something ?
these aren &apos;t plot holes , abed . this is my life .
but this kinda connection
only makes our origin story more compelling .
like how awesome it is
when uncle ben is murdered in spider @-@ man .
my marriage almost ended .
if it weren &apos;t for jeff ,
that jezebel would &apos;ve been in jail
instead of between my laura ashley sheets .
hey , this is not my fault .
and by the way , the case didn &apos;t work out too great for me either .
it was supposed to make my career ,
but it put a target on my back .
michael phelps , really ?
and it doesn &apos;t affect his breathing ?
nope .
mysti , can i talk to jeff for a moment ?
i will go , uh , powder my nose .
for real .
listen .
there &apos;s this rumor going around the firm
that you never received an undergraduate degree .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
i know .
i mean , some jag is obviously jealous of your rising star .
but the fact is , until this is settled ,
the bar isn &apos;t gonna let you practice .
so you got caught in your own lie ?
i almost lost my family .
how does your little tragedy even compare ?
because i had to go to school here .
abed , do not write that down .
it &apos;s not like i made andre cheat .
well , i happen to think it &apos;s cool that we &apos;re all connected ,
even if some of it &apos;s in bad ways .
i mean , i &apos;m finally willing to forgive annie
for ruining high school .
wait , i ruined your time in high school ?
yeah , you did .
you guys doing keg stands ?
yeah !
anyone can do a keg stand .
i &apos;m gonna do a keg flip .
hey , everybody , look at this .
my football knee ! why !
can i have some corn nuts ?
wah ! no ! nooooo !
that had nothing to do with me .
and you already admitted that you faked that injury
because you couldn &apos;t take the pressure of those football recruiters .
i faked my injury because of what you said to me .
because of what i said ?
you didn &apos;t even remember that i went to school with you .
i may have lied about that too .
hey , guys , it &apos;s time to do senior class superlatives !
okay , the first award is &quot; most handsome . &quot;
and the winner is ...
troy barnes .
of course it is .
&quot; most popular . &quot;
troy barnes .
no ! you guys are awesome .
&quot; best smile . &quot;
ha ha , gotta keep &apos; em white .
&quot; best moves . &quot; &quot; best practical joker . &quot;
&quot; coolest locker . &quot;
and now , the last award of the night .
&quot; most likely to succeed . &quot;
okay , this has to go to me ,
because i am most likely to succeed .
it &apos;s just a fact . you guys know .
and the winner is ...
troy barnes .
you have got to be kidding me !
troy barnes , most likely to succeed ?
i &apos;m the damn valedictorian and head of student council
and president of campus crusade for christ .
and i &apos;m jewish !
and you are just some mindless robot .
you just go wherever they tell you to run .
i &apos;m sorry .
do you go to my school ?
pop ! pop !
your words cut me more than hundreds of
non @-@ tempered glass shards could .
i had six different reconstructive surgeries .
i went through withdrawal .
i had to smile when i didn &apos;t feel like smiling .
that hurts my face .
can we all just stop dredging up the past ?
the only thing your fate web thing does
is point out how fragile our happiness is .
if only jeff hadn &apos;t defended that woman ,
if only andre hadn &apos;t met her after i left the restaurant ,
if only i didn &apos;t have to pick up my kids at the mall , i ...
wait .
when ? which mall ?
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what movie you guys gonna see ?
the phantom menace . it &apos;s kind of old .
and why do you wanna see it ?
because we like star wars .
okay , if you like star wars ,
why do you wanna murder it and urinate on its grave ?
the prequels are terrible .
i mean , seriously , wouldn &apos;t chewbacca , at some point ,
go , &quot; hey , yoda , i know that guy &quot; ?
he has double light sabers .
that &apos;s stupid . you &apos;re both stupid .
well , why are you here to see the movie ?
i &apos;m not .
i go wherever it plays to warn people .
you &apos;ve been warned .
stranger said what to him ?
okay , fine . i &apos;ll come get you .
i &apos;m sorry , baby , i &apos;ll be back as soon as i can .
okay , just stand there , okay ?
this can &apos;t be .
i don &apos;t see why i have to go to a therapist .
because after that woman chewed them out for three hours ,
the theater got a restraining order against you .
yalla .
hey , doc . by the way ,
someone just stole your prescription pad .
i &apos;m trying to liberate you !
you &apos;re the crazy man at the mall !
you &apos;re the one who got me busted for drugs !
you were out there somewhere and you weren &apos;t looking for me ?
in fairness , annie ,
running through a glass door might &apos;ve been the drug tip @-@ off .
all this time , i wondered what it was
that brought our group together .
but i forgot one thing all heroes need .
they need an enemy .
batman has the joker ,
the justice league has the legion of doom ,
and this study group ... has me .
i &apos;m the supervillain . why didn &apos;t i see it before ?
i &apos;m emotionless , logical , smarter than everybody else .
i tried sawing off jeff &apos;s arm .
why do you keep saying that ?
i should go . it &apos;s not safe to be around me .
i &apos;m just as bad .
i couldn &apos;t handle the monkey ,
so i traded it in for a glaucoma brownie ,
even though i knew if it bit someone ,
it would make them a teensy bit psychotic .
britta &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve all made some bad decisions .
and if you really wanna know who the villain is here ,
it &apos;s me .
yeesh , i didn &apos;t think it was possible
to put more glitter on .
it &apos;s coming off of you like pig @-@ pen .
well , some people seem to like it .
this married guy just gave me his phone number .
can you believe his wife left him on their anniversary ?
you gonna call him ?
i mean , he did just win a bunch of money .
i don &apos;t know though .
you don &apos;t know what ? you &apos;re not married .
you gotta grab what you want in this life .
that &apos;s the way it works .
someone just took something important from me .
and you know what ?
i admire him for it .
all right , i mean , i guess i &apos;ll go talk to him .
you do that . and i &apos;m gonna go get
&quot; crap on other people &apos;s lawns &quot; drunk .
to a memorable evening for both of us .
maybe you coincidentally affected some of us .
but i actively endorsed pain .
i was the bad guy , and ...
i &apos;d like to think i &apos;m not that guy anymore .
also , and i hate to bring this up ,
you did once make me pee myself .
well , i guess we &apos;re even then .
i might finish studying at home .
just ten minutes ago ,
i would &apos;ve been so excited about that peeing thing .
i want to make a prequel , and i ruined for everyone .
i guess it could happen to anyone .
i should probably write george lucas a note of apology .
okay , let &apos;s not get crazy .
and you didn &apos;t ruin anything .
may i sit here ?
shirley , what are you doing here ?
oh , just wanted some yogurt .
and i do know you &apos;re not that person anymore .
are you sure ? &apos; cause i was awfully good at it .
well , we all do bad things every now and again .
i mean , i put a stripper &apos;s head through a jukebox .
what are you guys doing here ?
i guess we all really wanted yogurt .
you know what &apos;s weird ?
this is where i first decided to go to greendale .
wait , really ?
this is where i was when i first decided to go to greendale .
you &apos;re kidding me .
senor chang , i know you &apos;re as disappointed as i am
in the caliber of students we have at greendale .
but the mall offers a whole new valuable demographic
of people awake during the daytime .
all right , i &apos;ll pass flyers at yogurtsburgh .
self @-@ serve yogurt .
those douses already know one marketable skill .
okay , ben ...
but it still has the tags on !
so i lost the receipt .
it &apos;s not like i even got to wear it ,
because my husband &apos;s a tasteless man slut .
what ... hey , littering !
this better not awaken anything in me .
god , this day ...
i thought pushing that woman &apos;s head through a jukebox
would make me feel better , but i &apos;m just ...
out of $ 54 ...
and a marriage .
crystal skull was aliens ,
so it &apos;s a pretty great film .
那就来格林德尔吧 !
you guys seen this ?
guys , working the program with you has been so great .
i feel like i &apos;m finally ready to get my life back on track .
last chance . just walk over there right now
and apologize to the theater manager .
midichlorians .
midichlorians !
fine .
then you &apos;re not going to film school !
hi ! do you have any vegan froyo ?
do you even know what froyo is ?
fine . do you have a job application ?
that weird guy hasn &apos;t blinked once .
oh , yeah .
what a dweeb .
yeah , what a dweeb .
oh , nice shot , man !
hey , do you work at greendale ?
work ? that &apos;s putting it charitably .
greendale community college is a total joke .
they &apos;d give a degree to a monkey .
hey , does ian duncan still teach psychogy at greendale ?
that drunken limey ?
that &apos;s the one .
he &apos;s got tenure .
maybe getting my degree won &apos;t be as hard as i thought .
sir , what are you doing ?
can we get some help out here ?
some old guy broke the machine and is faking a heart attack .
oh , wait .
ah , stupid .
cool , cool , cool .
wait , so was that old guy really pierce ?
we &apos;ll never know , because he &apos;ll never ever remember .
what are the chances of all of us
ending up at the same place at the same time twice ?
abed , it &apos;s amazing .
i mean , yes , 2008 was the height
of the slightly sour frozen yogurt craze , but ...
that still doesn &apos;t explain it .
maybe we really were all meant to be together .
i &apos;m not sure i understand it , but maybe we don &apos;t have to .
what i do know is that the ways our paths crossed ,
even when they were bad , all led us to this point .
and i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
so what you &apos;re saying
is that we &apos;re all each other &apos;s uncle ben &apos;s murder .
and we &apos;re all spider @-@ men .
yeah .
let &apos;s say i &apos;m saying that .
mm , i think we know whose will this really is .
yeah , i think i do .
i &apos;ll be right back .
hello ?
hey , abed .
just doing some pilates .
i was looking for you .
wha ... i ...
we discovered you &apos;re the reason we all went to greendale .
you linked all of our stories .
like how cosmic cube assembled the avengers .
that , and the 4 @-@ billion @-@ dollar deal with disney .
turns out you were always one of us .
so i came to see if you wanted to get some frozen yogurt .
really ?
that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s all i ever wanted .
but it &apos;s too late .
here &apos;s another thing i realized .
because of you we got to reinvent ourselves at greendale .
everyone should have the same chance , don &apos;t you think ...
chang ?
it &apos;s not chang .
it &apos;s kevin .
how long have you known ?
known what ?
only you know who you really are .
also , you may have experimental monkey fever .
you coming ?
yeah .
actually , can we stop at the post office first ?
i have something to mail for the dean .
it &apos;s confidential and i don &apos;t wanna talk about it ,
so stop interrogating me .
i &apos;m out .
you &apos;re too in to be out .
you want some refills ? on me , huh ?
refills ? you want some ?
time for plan &quot; b. &quot;
