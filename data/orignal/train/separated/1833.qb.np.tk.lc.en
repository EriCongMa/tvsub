we ask a lot about our patients
we put them to sleep
cut them open ,
poke around in their brains and guts .
with sharp instruments .
we ask for their blind trust .
the blue one .
when in doubt , always go with blue .
it brings out your eyes .
yeah . thanks .
the hospital , the staff , they love richard .
to them , i stabbed him in the back to get the job .
they &apos;re gonna be mad at me just like you are .
i am mad .
that doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t think you &apos;ll do a great job .
i think you &apos;ll be a very good chief .
irony is , trust is hard for surgeons ,
because we &apos;re trained from day one
that we can &apos;t trust anyone but ourselves .
the only instincts you can count on are your own ...
either one of you know what this big meeting &apos;s all about ?
i heard there was a coup .
webber &apos;s out . shepherd &apos;s in . is that true ?
we know what you know .
bull .
all right ? your sister &apos;s married to the guy .
you expect me to believe you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ?
don &apos;t you have your own loser friends to talk to ?
i also heard shepherd plans to clean house .
maybe he &apos;ll start with you .
dude , i &apos;m safe . the guy is my roommate .
you &apos;re the ones who should watch your backs .
why ? what do you know ?
simple math , shepherd hates the merger ,
you &apos;re from mercy west , you &apos;re toast .
derek &apos;s not gonna fire people
just because they &apos;re from mercy west .
he &apos;s not like that . he &apos;s loyal and fair .
yeah , tell that to webber .
the only skills you can count on are your own .
until one day , you leave the classroom
and step into the o.r.
i think we &apos;ve almost got the tumor out .
at this rate , we &apos;ll be finished early , grey .
you might be able to catch the end
of shepherd &apos;s big speech .
she &apos;s tachycardic .
you &apos;re surrounded by others , a team of others ...
i don &apos;t understand what happened .
everything appears to be in order here .
there &apos;s--there &apos;s no bleeders . i don &apos;t see any bleeders .
okay , i @-@ i don &apos;t see a @-@ a reason why down here ,
so why is her heart rate going through the roof ?
did you check her anastomosis ?
her anastomosis is intact . everything is intact .
what is--wait , wait , wait . did i just feel movement ?
she &apos;s awake , dr. bailey . the patient &apos;s awake .
a team that you have to rely on ...
whether you trust them or not .
爱与信任
what the hell did you do ?
get her back to sleep right now .
okay , i know you &apos;re scared right now ,
but it &apos;s gonna be okay . everything is going to be okay .
just try to breathe .
pushing 150 of propofol .
you think he &apos;s gonna give a big speech ?
i don &apos;t know .
so , um , look , about the other night . i was--
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
what the hell is he wearing ?
he looks good . chiefly .
he looks like an undertaker .
i promised him we &apos;d clap .
oh . now ?
i want to thank you all for being here .
i know you &apos;re busy ,
so i &apos;ll try to make this quick .
as you may have heard , i have been appointed
the new interim chief of surgery .
it &apos;s my personal goal
to make this transition as smooth as possible .
i know we &apos;ve had a rocky few months .
here it comes .
mistakes have been made .
he &apos;s talking about the merger .
sh
i intend to right those wrongs , and , uh ...
told you .
bring this hospital back to its former glory .
&quot; former glory . &quot; undertaker needs a speechwriter .
we are screwed .
yes , you are , sucker .
check it out . chief webber .
and , um ...
what i meant ...
uh , by that is-- what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
i want to thank you for your support in advance .
uh , that &apos;s all .
okay , let &apos;s get back to work .
avery , i need you to round up my charts
and bring &apos; em to room 22 @-@ 14 .
oh , yang , usually comes in early to do that . i &apos;m sure--
you know what ? yang &apos;s not on my service today . you are .
karev , i hear that you &apos;re the future of peds .
excuse me ?
yeah , a little birdie named bailey whispered it in my ear .
i want you to work with me today
so i can see if she &apos;s right .
what did she say ?
that you &apos;re the best babysitter in the hospital .
shut up .
you don &apos;t think peds is hard @-@ core ?
&apos;cause you could say that to my face , avery .
no . no , ma &apos;am .
mm @-@ hmm . don &apos;t let the roller skates fool you .
peds is nothing but hard @-@ core . rounds in ten .
peds .
who &apos;s the sucker now ?
i heard that ...
sloan was released from the hospital in l.a.
that &apos;s good .
is she , uh , is she coming back soon ? mark ?
this is some kind of joke .
you &apos;re not even gonna look at me ?
torres ... i have a hip decubitus ulcer
i need you to check out .
mature . really mature , mark .
basically , you have two options available to you .
you sign these , you &apos;re agreeing to an early retirement .
take an early pension , your license to practice medicine
will no longer be valid .
you &apos;d walk away from this hospital effective immediately ,
no strings attached .
you &apos;re not gonna sign that . you &apos;re gonna sign this .
which says that you are voluntarily enrolling yourself
in the physicians rehabilitation and treatment program .
go to rehab , richard .
you sober up , you get out , you have your job waiting .
pending board approval .
i need some time to think .
what is there to think about ?
you aren &apos;t considering quitting , are you ?
sorry to interrupt , but , chief .
yeah . - uh , yeah .
i &apos;m sorry . dr. shepherd ,
there &apos;s a situation that needs your attention .
excuse me .
she had the appropriate amount of anesthetic .
there is no--
the patient was open on the table ...
there is no way i &apos;m implicated in this , right ?
and he allowed her to wake up .
stop . stop . just every-- stop . just take a deep breath .
you check on the patient .
okay .
this can happen . it &apos;s happened to me .
any luck at all , she won &apos;t remember a thing .
which means she won &apos;t remember to sue us ?
exactly .
okay , how was that ? that was good , right ?
yeah , very chiefly .
good .
lose the tie .
what ? not the tie .
mr. and mrs . wilson ,
we &apos;re here to update you on the surgery .
we completed your tumor resection .
i was able to resect the entire thing
off of your abdominal wall .
which is a good thing .
things went very well .
really ?
how about the part when i woke up on the table ?
how well did that part go ?
where i could smell my own burning flesh--
how was that ?
when i was lying there ...
unable to speak
while i could actually feel you butchering my insides ?
i couldn &apos;t move . i was awake and couldn &apos;t move ,
and you had no idea .
how well did that part go ?
here &apos;s what we do .
i &apos;m gonna check the anesthetics themselves .
you draw a c.b.c. , a chem @-@ 18,
and let &apos;s do some genotyping studies .
oh , oh , &quot; here &apos;s what we do &quot; ? we ?
did you not hear her ?
that girl is traumatized .
so the only thing we are doing is getting sued .
because of you .
where do you even get off speaking to me like that ?
you have no idea what went wrong in that o.r.
well , here &apos;s what i know--
i know that you &apos;re new here ,
i know that you probably still have a chip on your shoulder
because your parking space at mercy west was better
and i know that you &apos;re an anesthesiologist ,
which means you make buckets of money
logging reasonable hours sitting on your behind
and flipping through &quot; architectural digest &quot;
while somebody on the other side of the curtain
does the real work and gets sued for it .
excuse me . you have no idea
i don &apos;t know what they did at mercy west ,
but here at seattle grace ,
we expect to be able to trust the gas man ,
trust him to do his job so that we can do ours .
we expect the gas man to stay awake at the switch
no matter how long and boring a procedure might be .
we expect the gas man to stay focused enough
to keep the patient unconscious !
how long would you say brad &apos;s been having the pain ?
off and on for months .
brad , is the pain constant
or is it worse at times , better at others ?
mm , it &apos;s usually bad in the mornings . like , right after breakfast .
which , i might point out , is , uh , when he has to go to school .
but i feel it at other times , too .
right , like , uh , when you have a spanish test .
or , uh , have to give a presentation in history class .
stress can exacerbate abdominal pain .
please , doctor , don &apos;t encourage him .
he &apos;s just faking so he could miss school .
i am not .
abdomen &apos;s soft , non @-@ tender , not rigid .
bowel sounds are good .
still , i &apos;d like to cover all the bases .
dr. karev , how would you proceed ?
we could try a triple @-@ contrast c.t.
mm @-@ hmm . do it .
brad , this is gonna cost us thousands of dollars ,
and insurance only covers part of it .
you--you know that , right ?
i &apos;m not faking it .
i--i &apos;m not faking it , dad . i swear .
dr. altman , uh , i noticed you have avery assigned
to all your surgeries this morning .
i do .
um , so there &apos;s no room ... for me on your service ?
well , you &apos;ve been on every one of my cases since i &apos;ve arrived .
this is a teaching hospital .
it &apos;s only fair i give other residents a chance .
yes . yes , of course . i @-@ i-- i understand .
um ... do you think you &apos;ll have room on your service tomorrow
or the next day ?
i , uh , i ... i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i just ...
i can &apos;t today , cristina . okay ?
i just ... i can &apos;t .
um , leslie , hi .
uh , this will only take a moment .
we just need to examine your incis
hey , careful .
i don &apos;t want you to touch me .
leslie ... i mean it .
don &apos;t let her touch me .
okay , uh , i @-@ i know that you &apos;ve been through a lot today ,
but if we don &apos;t check your in
i remember .
i remember you screaming in surgery .
you were panicking ... she &apos;s getting tachycardic .
panicking with your hand inside my body .
you were just ...
dr. bailey , her incision site is bleeding .
she could &apos;ve ripped it open .
i mean it . don &apos;t touch me !
okay .
i don &apos;t want you to touch me . don &apos;t t--no !
grey , redress the wound , okay ?
don &apos;t touch me !
uh , use the dressing to apply pressure with one hand
and grab as much gauze as you can with the other .
okay .
see that tape there ? you &apos;re gonna need you
a nice , long piece . uh @-@ huh .
hey . need some help ?
uh , no . i &apos;m good . thanks .
okay . never mind .
i need to talk to you about mark .
could you not rip those ?
he isn &apos;t speaking to me . he barely even looks at me .
and i know that we broke up , but we still work together ,
and i &apos;m gonna be a plastic surgeon .
you &apos;re not gonna be a plastic surgeon .
still , okay , we &apos;re gonna have to see each other every day .
i mean , he &apos;s best friends with my sister &apos;s post @-@ it husband .
i ... i don &apos;t know what to do .
i know . he &apos;s not exactly being fair .
no , he &apos;s not being fair . hey ,
seriously . go easy on the cast padding .
you know , at least he could be civil .
i had a one @-@ night stand . okay , big deal .
right .
it &apos;s not like he didn &apos;t sleep with addison .
ture , more than once .
what ? hmm ?
nothing . i didn &apos;t say anything .
more than once ?
more than once ? !
what about that ? that spot--see it ?
oh . that was lint .
it doesn &apos;t make sense . i mean , no kid wants to be
the loser missing class to go to the hospital .
i don &apos;t care how lame you are .
i loved the hospital when i was a kid .
no school , lots of cool medical supplies to play with
okay , yeah . so let &apos;s go over it again .
he presented with severe but intermittent abdominal pain ,
no discernable pattern .
labs were normal . no fever .
soft abdomen on exam .
we &apos;re missing something .
chronic mesenteric ischemia ?
ah . i mean , it &apos;s a stretch for a kid ,
but if he had vascular problems
no , it fits all the symptoms ,
and it doesn &apos;t show up on the scans .
yeah , but the problem is ,
the only way to get an accurate diagnosis
is to run an exploratory laparoscopy .
so ?
brad &apos;s father didn &apos;t want us to run a c.t.
you really think he &apos;s gonna agree to exploratory surgery ?
hey . you--you know , why-- teddy &apos;s blackballing me .
she &apos;s not saying that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing ,
but i think that &apos;s what she &apos;s do--
i don &apos;t want to talk about teddy .
do you want to talk about teddy ?
no .
i heard he had some kind of mental breakdown .
i heard it was drugs .
no way . prescription or
go practice medicine , now .
richard . this--sitting here--
this isn &apos;t good . this isn &apos;t helping things .
just sign the paper . go to rehab .
sign the paper . who the hell do you think you are ? who do you--
look , you are not my boss and you are not my chief .
you may have stolen my office out from under me
you &apos;re in trouble
i am trying to help you .
i helped you !
like you helped me .
i didn &apos;t get you fired .
you got fired the minute you took your first drink .
get out of my face .
no . no , you &apos;re not gonna do this .
you &apos;re not ending your career to get back at me .
i did what i had to do and nothing more .
you look me in the eye and you say that again .
i wanted the job .
i wanted the job . i admit that .
i didn &apos;t want to end your career .
well , that part &apos;s not up to you , is it ?
you did what you had to do .
but this part ... is up to me .
so get out .
no !
stop it , both of you .
people are watching .
get back to work .
the gas man would like an apology .
what ?
leslie wilson &apos;s cytochrome p @-@ 450 results .
the type she has means
she metabolizes anesthetic drugs too fast
way more rapidly than you or me .
there &apos;s no way we could &apos;ve known that before surgery .
so this is why she woke up ?
it is .
you don &apos;t have to get down on your knees and apologize ,
but i would like something heartfelt .
you know , something in the neighborhood of ,
&quot; you were right . i was rash , kind of mean . &quot;
maybe even throw in a , &quot; turns out
you &apos;re a hell of a doctor . &quot;
it wasn &apos;t our fault . that &apos;s ... that &apos;s good news .
she &apos;s gonna need a second surgery .
the incision site won &apos;t stop bleeding .
she might have internal bleeding .
okay . it &apos;s not gonna be easy ,
but now i know how to keep her under .
she won &apos;t let me touch her .
i &apos;m good with patients .
they always trust me .
i @-@ i--i &apos;ve never ...
look , i don &apos;t even know how to ...
she won &apos;t let me touch her .
why are you walking like that ?
uh , i got a burn .
where ?
go away .
well , we &apos;re both doctors . no need to be embarrassed .
i &apos;m not embarrassed . i &apos;m just waiting for meredith .
now ... go away .
i let you treat my tick . come on .
this is not a tick .
today sucks .
mark sucks .
yeah ? yang got burns on her girl parts .
oh . oh , wow .
i do not--it &apos;s not on-- on my girl parts .
well , then they &apos;re on her ass .
look how she &apos;s walking .
don &apos;t you two have patients ?
how did you get burns on your ass ?
you paged ?
mer , come .
the rest of you , bye .
oh , my god !
not so loud .
how did you ... what did ...
you have grate marks burned into your ass .
yeah , vent marks , but same difference .
i was busy having sex .
will you please just dress the wound ?
owen &apos;s being very caveman @-@ like .
and it &apos;s hot--
vaguely disturbing , but mostly hot .
i @-@ i think he might still be a little upset
that i offered him to teddy .
alex !
alex !
oh . hot cross buns .
that &apos;s gonna blister .
will you get them out of here ?
i--bailey &apos;s paging me . lexie , will you finish this for me ?
oh , oh , my god . i hate you . what ...
i &apos;ll take alex with me .
let &apos;s go . come on .
is this a sex injury ?
oh , my god .
it is .
i used to have sex injuries with mark .
mark was really awesome
at leaving you with good ... sex injuries .
and ...
please don &apos;t cry on my ass .
i &apos;m sorry .
please don &apos;t cry .
hey , are you--
busy .
dr. altman ... i pulled everything you asked for .
it &apos;s all here in numerical order according to room number .
numerical order ?
is that not how
it &apos;s fine .
yang always orders them according to priority--
most urgent to least urgent--
but ... it &apos;s fine .
it--it &apos;ll work . follow me .
no . just no . you are not cutting open our son with no evidence
that there &apos;s anything even wrong
dad
jim
no ! listen to me ,
that is thousands of dollars we &apos;re talking about ,
on what , a hunch , huh ?
he &apos;s got nervous stomach
and crappy grades . that &apos;s it .
i hated school , too , brad . okay ? i got it .
your mother and i , we have jobs and we go to them .
you have school . that &apos;s your job .
no surgery . it &apos;s insane . just--no . no .
you think it &apos;s right for them to take him home ?
it isn &apos;t .
shh . brad , i &apos;m teaching .
you think he &apos;s faking ?
no .
what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;d like to push his dad &apos;s face into a wall . no offense .
yeah , no . that that &apos;d be good .
well , barring physical violence ,
what are you gonna do ?
this is peds . your patients can &apos;t advocate for themselves .
so in addition to surgery , a big part of the job
is advocating for them . you think you can do that ?
yes , this is exploratory surgery ,
and , yes , brad &apos;s scans look clean ,
but if we &apos;re right ,
if he has mesenteric ischemia
and you take him home ,
the blood flow to his intestine will slowly stop ,
killing the tissue , causing brad to become septic ,
forcing his body into such intense shock
that by the time you realize what &apos;s happening
and you call an ambulance ,
the chance of brad getting back to the hospital alive
is next to zero .
you think he &apos;s faking . i get that .
so the only real question is , how sure are you ? how sure ?
i understand your hesitation ,
but we don &apos;t have a choice .
you need a second surgery .
haven &apos;t you put her through enough for one day ?
i can make some calls , see if
we can get you transferred to another hospital .
a transfer takes time , and the longer we wait ,
she &apos;s at greater risk for infection or blood loss .
leslie , i know you &apos;re scared ,
but the dressing i did earlier is only temporary .
it needs to be fixed properly .
it was like being in a coffin-- alive ... in a coffin .
i couldn &apos;t talk , couldn &apos;t move .
the thought of your hand back inside me ...
leslie , sweetie , you don &apos;t have to do anything
you don &apos;t want to do .
you can do it .
what ?
you were there .
you stayed calm . you were kind .
oh , dr. bailey is far more experienced than--
she &apos;s not touching me .
you have to promise me she won &apos;t touch me .
you can do it .
she can &apos;t .
what do you think of the present i got from hunt for becoming chief ?
from hunt , huh ?
i was gonna get you one of those .
the deluxe version . you know , the kind that keeps score ?
not , uh , you know , the cheaper one .
that &apos;s my chair .
i know . i like it .
it makes me feel powerful .
that was quite a scene in the conference room earlier .
oh , you saw that .
yeah , the whole hospital did . what happened there ?
how &apos;d you dethrone the chief and--and why ?
i can &apos;t talk about it .
not even to me ?
it &apos;s not my story to tell .
heads @-@ up .
looks like i &apos;m facing a lawsuit .
first day out--patient wakes up on the table .
you know lexie slept with alex karev
while i was in l.a. dealing with my sick daughter ?
well , according to meredith , you were doing
a little more in los angeles than just dealing with little sloan .
she dumped me .
which is why you went back to sleeping with my ex @-@ wife ?
you slept with his ex @-@ wife ?
wait a sec . you &apos;re remarried . what do you care ?
i &apos;m just saying , the karev thing is forgivable considering .
not to me .
what ?
is that a hickey ?
uh , it &apos;s , uh , it &apos;s--it &apos;s a birthmark .
it is . it &apos;s a hickey .
all right , cristina and i have been ... getting along .
well , you two are good together .
not like me and lexie or ...
way better than yang and burke .
yeah , i never understood those two .
monosyllabic .
you know , i made a bet she &apos;d never make it down that aisle .
won 50 bucks .
what aisle ?
oh , you haven &apos;t heard that story ? that &apos;s a good story .
uh , it &apos;s not your story to tell .
bailey is letting me operate
on a post @-@ op internal bleeding patient ...
by myself .
do you think i can handle it ?
i think i can .
derek tells me you &apos;re thinking about quitting .
i think if my mother were here to see this ,
she would kick your ass for even considering it .
these loops of bowel look clean , too .
nothing .
nothing .
crap .
i bullied them into totally unnecessary surgery for their kid .
no , it wasn &apos;t unnecessary . by not finding anything ,
we &apos;re one step closer to finding out what isn &apos;t wrong with brad ,
which means we &apos;re one step closer to finding what is .
at least that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna tell his very angry parents .
his very angry parents .
me ?
yeah . you bullied &apos; em into surgery .
you &apos;re gonna take the heat . more suction , please .
b.p. took a dip . he &apos;s getting unstable .
bolus him with a liter , and let &apos;s get him closed .
all right . we may not have found the problem ,
but there &apos;s absolutely something wrong here .
you know ... there isn &apos;t anything that says
you can &apos;t operate once she &apos;s under .
she would never know .
i &apos;m not operating on a patient
who doesn &apos;t want me to operate on her .
if she wants a resident doing her surgery ,
she gets a resident doing her surgery .
i wouldn &apos;t let you operate
unless i thought you could handle it .
well , i could perforate her bowel .
you won &apos;t !
look , i &apos;ll be with you the whole time .
hey , dr . webber was mentoring you .
there &apos;s no reason why i can &apos;t do the same .
well , the chief wasn &apos;t exactly mentoring me because of my talent .
richard webber is not a man
who wastes his time on just anybody .
the last time he mentored a surgeon , it was me .
what , you think i don &apos;t have talent ?
all right . well , hurry up and finish scrubbing in .
you &apos;ve got a patient waiting .
do you really think shepherd &apos;s gonna cut all of us ?
what ?
the mercy westers do you think we &apos;re all gone ?
i mean , just tell me
if you think that i need to start looking for a job ?
is there a reason our son is in i.c.u. ?
did you figure out what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , not exactly .
why does he have a tube in his chest ?
you said you were doing abdominal surgery .
brad became briefly unstable in surgery ,
so we had to put in a central line .
well , it &apos;s got a little kink , so his lung , it started
alex !
hang on . are you saying you cut into our son for nothing
and caused more damage ? wait . what ?
blood . blood . there is a lot of blood in the chest tube .
what ? oh , my god. get get a chest tray and some gloves 。
he &apos;s already put out 700 cc &apos;s blood .
what &apos;s going on ?
sir , you need to leave right now .
like hell we &apos;re leaving .
somebody tell us what &apos;s going on .
he &apos;s crashing . page cardio and robbins .
oh , my god !
right away , doctor . we can &apos;t wait for cardio . crap !
what the hell is going on ? !
brad
i need to open him up . scalpel .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
get away from our son !
please leave !
get away from our son !
mo suction , please
there . i think i got it .
let me in . what happened ?
he put out more than 2 liters of blood in the last five minutes ,
but i think i found the source ,
cause the bleeding started to calm down .
all right . jump on . we &apos;re moving to the o.r.
page cristina yang .
right away , doctor .
no . wait .
no . no . wait . hang on . hang on .
oh , it &apos;s--it &apos;s teddy .
so ?
i--no , it &apos;s teddy .
so ? you &apos;re not on her service .
no , but i have to--
don &apos;t go . don &apos;t go . she has another resident today .
stay here with me .
stay here with me .
don &apos;t go .
please .
oh . all right .
what &apos;s going on ? how is he ?
he &apos;s critical .
he has a ruptured aortic arch dissection .
hardly ever catch them , but karev here
may have worked a little miracle .
nice work , karev .
damn it . where the hell is yang ?
i need a second set of hands .
you want me to scrub in ?
dr. altman , i &apos;m available .
she &apos;s waiting for yang .
yeah , i know . believe me , i know i &apos;m not cristina yang .
okay ? you made that perfectly clear today .
but if you give me a chance , i have very good hands .
i can do this . okay ? i can help .
cannulate the femoral artery and vein ,
and then we &apos;re gonna cool him down fast .
we have 30 minutes to complete this repair
or this patient is toast .
bowel looks fine .
okay , just check the anastomosis and keep going .
everything still good ?
b.p. &apos; s stable , bis level &apos;s 45 .
she &apos;s sound asleep ,
just like the last time you asked .
two minutes ago .
anastomosis looks clean . bowel &apos;s intact .
good . get a new mesh .
oh , and , uh , so you know ,
i don &apos;t read &quot; architectural digest &quot; in the o.r.
no , that , uh , magazine i read earlier ?
that was the &quot; journal of clinical anesthesia , &quot;
in case you were wondering .
i wasn &apos;t .
ready for the mesh . suture , please .
okay , get a good bite of fascia .
i actually don &apos;t like the sitting down part of my job .
it &apos;s not great for the back ,
you know , and , uh , i like to keep in shape
so i can lift my big buckets of money .
i yell when i &apos;m scared .
some people whimper or duck . i yell .
when she woke up ,
it was one of the scariest moments of my life , so i yelled ,
and then i yelled some more .
it &apos;s what i do .
was that an apology ?
closest thing you &apos;re gonna get .
ooh . nice skin graft .
thank you .
so i was talking to lexie ...
wh @-@ why ?
when ? why are you talking to her ?
no , she came to me . and actually , she--
don &apos;t do this .
you &apos;re my friend , not hers .
don &apos;t take her side .
i &apos;m not picking sides .
i &apos;m just saying , she made some good points .
she dumped me and jumped into bed with karev .
she doesn &apos;t get to make good points .
mark , don &apos;t you think you &apos;re being a little ...
what , mad , offended , disgusted ?
hypocritical , sexist , immature ?
she dumped me !
not the other way around .
she dumped me , and for wanting to step up
and be responsible with my own daughter .
you know how big a step that is for me .
and you know how much i wanted to take that step with lexie .
i &apos;m not the one who &apos;s immature !
and you made me wreck my skin graft !
leslie &apos;s out of surgery .
how &apos;d the repair go ?
oh , just fine . no complications .
meredith did an excellent job .
good . that &apos;s good .
good news .
how &apos;s the lawyer ?
lawyer &apos;s still here , drooling .
oh , damn it . damn it .
tough first day , chief ?
tough first day .
you know , nine times out of ten ,
you can make a lawsuit go away
if you apologize .
people like to feel heard .
they like to feel respected .
and they like to hear an apology .
that &apos;s what chief webber would do .
he &apos;d walk right into that woman &apos;s room
the minute she got out of recovery ,
and he &apos;d apologize .
oh , dr. altman .
when i page you , i expect an answer .
i know . i--i &apos;m sorry . i was just , uh--
i had a ruptured aortic arch dissection ,
and i thought that-- an aortic arch dissection ?
i thought at the very least ,
i could rely on you to act professionally .
everything okay ?
uh , uh , dr. altman , i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re right .
it won &apos;t happen again .
i should &apos;ve responded to your page .
no , wait . i ... this wasn &apos;t cristina &apos;s fault .
i detained her for a trauma thing .
oh , really ?
now you have something to say to me ?
you know what ? forget it .
what ?
what are you trying to do to me ?
cristina , i &apos;m ...
oh , come on .
his heart ruptured ?
this is unbelievable .
how could you not find this ?
well , his heart symptoms presented as abdominal pains ,
which is an extremely rare presentation .
it &apos;s almost impossible to diagnose .
but the most important thing is that brad is doing fine .
fine ? you call him being hooked up to tubes and ...
you call that &quot; fine &quot; ?
dude , seriously , we &apos;re the only reason your kid &apos;s alive .
okay , karev
if you &apos;d had it your way , you &apos;d have been home
when brad &apos;s aorta ruptured ,
and he &apos;d be dead right now .
think about how much school he &apos;d be missing then ,
karev ! we &apos;re done here . excuse me .
follow me right now .
go away . please , bailey .
i don &apos;t want you to see me like this .
uh , all due respect , chief ,
everybody &apos;s been seeing you like this all day .
i don &apos;t know details .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on with you ,
but you can &apos;t sit here anymore , not like this .
i can &apos;t give them this .
shepherd , jennings--
if i do what they want me to do ,
it &apos;s like saying that they were right ,
right about doing this ,
right about me .
saying they were right about what ?
they want me to say i &apos;m an alcoholic .
well , are you an alcoholic ?
yes .
but if i sign these papers ,
then i have to stop drinking
and go to rehab .
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready to do that .
drinking ...
feels a little bit like all i have left .
you are better than this .
i &apos;ve seen you be better .
look , the way to win , the way to beat them ,
is to stop fighting them .
you go get better .
you be the man that i &apos;ve always known you to be .
you be the chief .
be the chief .
if you want to work in peds , you can &apos;t get emotional .
you said it was part of the job .
no , no . there &apos;s a difference
between advocating for tiny humans
and berating terrified parents .
you &apos;re good with kids . i can see that .
you &apos;ve got great hands and great instincts .
we already knew that .
and you &apos;re as good as anyone i &apos;ve seen
when it comes to advocating for your patients .
but until you &apos;ve been a parent ,
until you &apos;ve stayed up nights with a screaming infant
or dealt day in and day out with a terrorist toddler
or raised a lying teenager ,
you don &apos;t get to judge parents .
you have to advocate for the kids .
you don &apos;t get to berate terrified parents .
you clear on that ?
yes .
good . then you go apologize to that family .
karev .
you saved that kid &apos;s life today .
how &apos;d it feel ?
it feels great .
hard @-@ core , right ?
yeah .
welcome to peds .
hi . i know it &apos;s been a long day ,
and you &apos;re all anxious to get home .
but i feel like we got off on the wrong foot this morning .
i don &apos;t expect to win your trust overnight .
but i want each of you to know ...
you have mine .
which is why i felt it was important
to personally come in here and , uh , apologize .
mrs. wilson , do you have a moment ?
i want to clear some things up .
i &apos;d like to offer each of you your jobs back .
now there are gonna be cuts down the line ,
but you both deserve a fighting chance .
oh , my god .
thank you . dr. shepherd , thank you .
thank you .
i am neither pro nor anti merger .
from this point on , everyone has a clean slate .
i am not focused on the past .
i &apos;m trying to understand you .
you &apos;ve been trying to screw me into submission .
i was not .
you &apos;ve been trying to screw me into submission ,
and i let you , because the sex was so good
and your ego was hurt .
i am trying .
i am trying to understand you .
i am trying to know you .
i am trying to ... love you ,
and i don &apos;t know how .
i don &apos;t know how &apos; cause you don &apos;t give me anything .
oh , so the--the vent burn was ,
uh , you branding me ,
like i &apos;m like i &apos;m chattel ?
i &apos;m trying ! damn it .
i don &apos;t know you . i don &apos;t know you
cause you don &apos;t give me anything .
i give you everything .
burke .
what ?
burke . preston burke . you were engaged .
there was almost a wedding . why didn &apos;t that happen ?
no . no , i &apos;m not-- we &apos;re not doing this .
you see ? you give me nothing . maybe ...
maybe i was trying to screw you into submission .
maybe i was trying to ... connect .
i &apos;ll try anything .
i &apos;ll try anything , but you have to give me something back .
well , burke is irrelevant .
oh , yeah . like i &apos;ll be in three years &apos; time .
that &apos;s not fair .
i &apos;m trying to love you . why won &apos;t you let me ?
burke ...
burke was , uh ...
he took something from me .
he took little pieces of me ...
little pieces over time ,
so small , i didn &apos;t notice , you know ?
he wanted me to be something i wasn &apos;t ,
and i made myself into what he wanted .
one day i was me-- cristina yang .
and then suddenly i was lying for him
and , uh , jeopardizing my career
and , uh , agreeing to be married
and wearing a ring and being a bride ...
until i was standing there ...
in a wedding dress with no eyebrows ,
and i wasn &apos;t cristina yang anymore .
and even then , i would &apos;ve married him .
i would have .
i lost myself for a long time .
and now ...
that i &apos;m finally me again ...
i can &apos;t ...
i love you . i love you more than i loved burke .
i love you .
and that scares the crap out of me
because ...
when you asked me to ignore teddy &apos;s page ,
you took a piece of me ...
and i let you .
and ...
that will never happen ... again .
i &apos;m looking to the future ...
you feel better ?
a little .
this really isn &apos;t gonna work for me .
to all the promise this hospital has to offer .
i plan to honor richard webber
and his legacy ,
not undo it ...
thank you , richard .
i &apos;m sorry .
which is why i &apos;m both humbled and honored ...
to be your new chief of surgery .
