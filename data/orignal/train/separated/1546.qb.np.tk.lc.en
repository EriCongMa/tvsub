come on , joe . buff that sucker .
what &apos;d i teach you ?
sanitary .
is joe applying for a job in a train station in 1940 ?
just teaching him a few things every man should know .
someone has to get in there early ,
or sometimes the kid turns out funny .
knock , knock .
hey , phil .
hey , guys .
phil , in here !
you ready to tackle your website ?
i know i &apos;m here a little early .
i thought i was gonna be --
do you recognize that ?
are you kidding ? i love your sauce .
some of it fell out of my burrito last night ,
and i licked it right off the remote .
that &apos;s auntie alice &apos;s new sauce !
she stole my recipe !
i know .
i am the crazy colombian that always loses her temper
and needs to be calmed down by the white people .
no ! i don &apos;t think you &apos;re being crazy enough .
i &apos;m not a violent man , but i know how nuts it can make you
to create something special only to have it stolen from you .
do you remember a hit song called &quot; happy &quot; ?
yeah , it was like a couple of years ago
with the clapping and the hat .
a couple of years ago , huh ?
so a full four years after this burst on the scene .
* because i &apos;m snappy *
* snap with me if you think that today is a good day *
* that &apos;s right , i &apos;m snappy *
* snap with me if you took a test and you got an a *
* you see , i &apos;m snappy *
sounds just a little similar , right ?
a little , but
thank you !
but do you think that he saw this ?
um , it had 27 views .
come on . we &apos;re going down to that market
to make that old bat cease and desist .
i will not stand idly by
while auntie alice pharrell williamses you .
where are you two going ?
to the market .
we need olives !
and then when the lights go out , she &apos;ll be able to read
the glow @-@ in @-@ the @-@ dark ink on your t @-@ shirt .
oh , my god . she &apos;s gonna love it .
she ? who &apos;s she ?
what are you guys working on ?
nothing .
nothing .
oh , okay . i get it , yeah .
he &apos;s -- i &apos;ll just be down in the bedroom , you know ,
at the end of the -- at the end of the hall .
hey , thanks for your help .
i really like this girl ,
and there &apos;s just so much pressure
to do something spectacular when you ask a girl out to prom .
is there something wrong with your air vents ?
no , cam breathes through his nose when he hides .
a promposal ? to who ? laurie vock ?
oh , no . she &apos;s ian jacobs &apos; girl .
melanie rylance ? you have to be careful with her .
she has more cold sores than abby burmeister .
but seriously , luke , everything you say here
is completely confidential .
oh , you know , they are looking for chaperones for prom ,
and i thought maybe we could
no , no .
we have tickets to the opening of &quot; cabaret &quot; that night .
i &apos;m not missing it so i can tell some teenage girl
to keep her dress on .
i spent my own prom doing that .
okay , can i just point out the absurdity
that you ask this uncle to advise you and not this uncle ,
who hung a valentine &apos;s banner outside of his office that said ,
&quot; mitchell , you &apos;re the best husband , father , and lover . &quot;
didn &apos;t love all three of those being rolled into one sentence .
sounded a little ozark @-@ y .
no , cam . stop .
what ?
luke &apos;s just looking for an adviser
who &apos;s a little more understated
and a little less , you know ...
david stuart .
oh , i get it .
he &apos;s quite gay .
yes , i got it .
okay , well , you know what ?
i would hate to muck up your promposal
with my flair and panache .
i &apos;m sure the lucky girl will swoon with delight
when you use a mustard bottle
to write &quot; wanna go ? &quot; on her turkey burger .
hello ?
there &apos;s an intruder in the house .
what ? !
but you have nothing to worry about
with pritchett &apos;s guardian 3000 closet ,
which doubles as a military @-@ grade panic room .
so no intruder ?
no !
i &apos;m just so excited about this idea .
i &apos;m debuting it next week at closetcon .
what do you think ?
i think i &apos;m studying for finals .
can &apos;t you scare the crap out of a focus group ?
like i &apos;m gonna share my best closet idea
with a room full of strangers
four days before the most hotly anticipated
storage convention in north america .
good point . you do have haley &apos;s number , right ?
* from the first time that i saw your face *
* i knew you could be mine *
alex dunphy , would you make me the happiest cat in school
and swing by prom with me ?
sha @-@ na @-@ nope .
hey , jerry . for some reason , i &apos;m locked out of my computer .
apparently , someone tried to access my e @-@ mail
before i got in .
someone hell @-@ bent on leaking company secrets .
it is four days until c @-@ con , and pritchett &apos;s closets has a mole .
no one is above suspicion .
margaret , where were you this morning at 9 : 45 a.m. ?
i &apos;m so sorry i was late .
i was at overeaters anonymous .
i woke up next to the ice cream again .
so not margaret .
i know who that locker belongs to .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re asking that cheap ho to the prom .
cam !
sarah ho !
she gave me a $ 5 gift card for teacher appreciation day .
what &apos;s with the birds ?
oh , these are just some turtledoves for manny &apos;s promposal .
you &apos;re joking .
you felt so slighted over luke asking me
that you foisted yourself on manny ?
there was no foisting .
i asked manny if he needed help .
he was too proud to admit that he did , so here we are .
is it possible there &apos;s something deeper going on with you
around this whole prom area ?
is it possible you &apos;re second @-@ guessing
your no @-@ frills approach ?
especially compared to turtledoves , backup dancers ,
and dry ice so manny can appear in a cloud of mist .
a cloud of mist ?
like in a movie ?
is our thing gonna seem lame now ?
steady .
now , now . i &apos;m sure your thing is fine .
what did your little locker note say ?
&quot; go to the gym . &quot;
intriguing .
what delights await her in the gym ?
another note telling her to go to the parking lot .
well , i should help manny set up .
should i be worried ?
don &apos;t freak me out right now , okay ?
okay . all right .
it &apos;s fine . just fine .
you don &apos;t have to use it , but at least you &apos;ll have it .
hello , auntie alice .
or should she say auntie malice ?
no , gloria &apos;s right . it &apos;s alice .
i didn &apos;t know you were in today .
you &apos;re in -- trouble !
is he okay ?
you stole my sauce !
what ?
uh , i &apos;m sorry . maybe you don &apos;t hear so good .
she said , &quot; you ... stole ... her ... sauce . &quot;
that &apos;s spicy .
that &apos;s not the sauce she stole .
that &apos;s her volcano sauce .
in her ad , one drop turns a hockey rink into a swimming pool .
it &apos;s her new sauce , the one that tastes just like mine .
how are you going to explain that ?
yeah , we want answers and a little bread .
your fight &apos;s not with me .
i &apos;m not really auntie alice .
oh , come on .
your cute face is in the bottle !
auntie alice is a brand that was created by a big corporation .
so they were the ones who stole my sauce ?
they steal all kinds of products .
and they have an army of lawyers
just ready to crush anyone who challenges them .
so we just have to take it ?
it &apos;s in my eye ! oh !
please don &apos;t repeat any of this , or i could lose my job .
i &apos;m still paying off my improv classes .
how is this food ? !
this will probably be yours someday ,
so no reason you shouldn &apos;t learn to do this .
does manny know how to change oil ?
bath oils .
what ? bath oil ?
there &apos;s my guy .
let me grab the dipstick .
this stick ?
manny . okay . i just briefed the team .
dry ice is ready . bow ties are on the birds .
save it , cam .
megan already said yes to shawn reeves .
he asked her last period .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , manny .
can &apos;t really blame her .
i mean , you try saying no to shawn reeves
with his weatherman smile and his exotic canadian accent .
well , there must be someone else you can ask .
no , that &apos;s okay . there &apos;s always next year .
at least this way i can see the opening of &quot; cabaret . &quot;
oh , please . it &apos;s just &quot; cabaret . &quot;
it &apos;s been revived more times than dick cheney .
okay . you &apos;re not missing your prom .
cam ... i &apos;m getting the feeling
this is much more important to you than it is to me .
well , maybe because i didn &apos;t get to go to mine .
oh . i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , it &apos;s a painful story .
i get it . some things are better left unsaid .
her name was tina day .
we were just friends , but i was so into asking her ,
i rented a white stallion and a suit of armor .
i wanted it to be a whole &quot; knight and day &quot; theme .
i was promposing before it was even a thing .
i rode up her driveway ,
and i could see when she opened the door
through the little slits in my helmet
what her answer was gonna be .
she wanted a traditional prom night with a guy
she could lose her virginity to .
i couldn &apos;t blame her .
i wanted the same thing .
there &apos;s always melanie rylance ,
but you wouldn &apos;t want me to ask someone --
delta , ready the dancers and dove cannon .
poor lady .
i feel terrible for screaming at her like that .
i blame myself .
i blame yourself , too .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just kind of going through something .
i got bumped from lily &apos;s career day this morning
by a periodontist .
that &apos;s right . my job is less interesting that root rot .
who cares about a bunch of third graders ?
you love being a real @-@ estate agent .
first of all , i &apos;m not just a real @-@ estate agent .
i &apos;m a realtor .
i &apos;m a member of a national association ,
a brotherhood , sworn to the realtor code of ethics !
that &apos;s what this &quot; r &quot; stands for .
though , lately , it feels like it stands for &quot; regret . &quot;
i know everything there is to know about real estate ,
and nobody seems to care .
maybe i have the most boring job in the world .
no , phil .
closets is the most boring job in the world .
ay , poor thing .
she has to take the bus .
let &apos;s offer her a ride .
yes , yes .
a maserati ?
she lied to us !
no , that means &quot; follow her . &quot;
hello ?
hey , mom .
how do you turn on the sprinklers for the front lawn ?
uh , it &apos;s a little control box by the front door . why ?
no reason .
look , now that i &apos;ve got you on the phone ,
i &apos;m thinking it might be time to upgrade our internet security .
thoughts ?
get rid of the post @-@ it note on your laptop
with your password on it .
why are you so worried about security ?
it &apos;s my first closetcon as c.e.o. ,
and i am dealing with corporate espionage .
well , if you &apos;re so worried about it ,
why don &apos;t you just call grandpa ?
do you know how that would look ?
i mean , it &apos;s bad enough to go to the person
who had your job before you ,
but when that person is daddy ...
honey , closet people are ruthless .
they &apos;d eat me alive .
or maybe the world isn &apos;t filled with heartless monsters .
my phone is wet .
can you call my mom ?
hey , guys . sorry i &apos;m late .
i just got off the horn
with rick friedman over at shelf involved .
that poor guy .
someone there has given away corporate secrets .
makes me so glad that we just upgraded our whole security system .
i mean , we got hidden cameras around this place
that i don &apos;t even know about .
so , we got a cake for margaret &apos;s birthday .
fun .
how you doing , ben ?
me ? i &apos;m good . i am good .
i am chill .
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom , so ...
it &apos;s not really my birthday .
i just wanted cake .
i eat garbage because i am garbage .
hey , dad . hi .
um , listen . can i call you back ?
just wanted to confirm we &apos;re on for dinner at --
oh , got another call . one sec .
yeah , i think she &apos;s onto us .
yeah , a lot of mole talk .
i think we just need to calm things d--
what ?
you &apos;re talking to her right now ?
yeah , okay , bye .
so , we &apos;re on for tonight ?
sure .
great .
and , hey , you sound a little tense .
don &apos;t let the job make you crazy , huh ?
you go that route , soon you &apos;re seeing plots everywhere .
great tip , dad .
you &apos;re spying for my dad !
what ? no ! yes . i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know why i agreed .
i just look up to your dad so much .
i can &apos;t believe he doesn &apos;t trust me .
why did he put me in charge , then ?
i don &apos;t know , but i can find out .
i &apos;ll double @-@ agent .
i &apos;ve been working this game since my parents &apos; divorce .
i was the only 10 @-@ year @-@ old in great neck
with no bedtime and diners club card .
fine . don &apos;t make any plans for tonight .
you &apos;re coming to dinner with me .
all right . um , can we stop by my house to change my shoes ?
i didn &apos;t make it up here on the first try .
all right , the dove cannon &apos;s loaded ,
the dancers are stretching , the dry ice is billowing .
the moment you get her outside , i will cue the team .
oh , there she is .
okay . go .
all right , team . look alive .
we are hot . we are hot .
hey , melanie . listen -- - manny .
do you want to go to prom with me ?
uh , sure .
you got a second ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m second . you &apos;re first .
i get it . you win everything .
that seems like something i &apos;m gonna hear about later .
i need help with luke &apos;s promposal , okay ?
can you go to the gym , wait for sarah , and then hand her this ?
okay , this is what i &apos;ve been reduced to ?
delivering an unperfumed envelope like a common bellhop ? fine .
thank you . okay .
stand down , everybody .
little bear &apos;s gone rogue .
wait .
grayson ! hey .
hey , coach .
hey .
don &apos;t suppose you &apos;re planning on asking anyone to prom .
um , i don &apos;t think we &apos;re allowed to go with teachers .
that &apos;s not what ...
so , this is the house that stolen sauce built .
i &apos;m so angry that i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m gonna say to her !
ah , so , this is the house that the stolen sauce built !
oh , i know what you &apos;re thinking , but this isn &apos;t my house .
i just come here to get my paycheck .
grandma , my shower &apos;s broken .
i &apos;m gonna use the one in the guesthouse .
please be my new piano teacher .
fine .
i &apos;m auntie alice .
auntie thief and auntie liar .
yeah , yeah .
i &apos;m sure we can work something out .
who &apos;s your patent lawyer ?
i don &apos;t have one .
i know .
i patented your sauce this morning .
have a good trip home , kids .
i am so sorry , phil , that i wasted your whole day ,
but i am more sorry of what i &apos;m gonna do to your car !
gloria , we &apos;re above that .
but not everyone would be .
you should put that beauty in your garage .
i don &apos;t have one .
oh , really ?
just out of curiosity , do you not have a garage
because you converted it into the guesthouse
where your grandson &apos;s currently showering ?
what &apos;s your game , mister ?
i just find it interesting that you have
a fully plumbed stand @-@ alone dwelling on your property .
that &apos;s none of your business .
even more peculiar , your grandson appears to live here ,
but judging by his t @-@ shirt , he goes to eden mills high ,
an elite public school 12 miles outside of your district .
oh , maybe with the money you saved on private schools ,
you paid for the new two @-@ sided brick fireplace i saw ,
which hasn &apos;t been legal since 1988 .
go , phil , go !
pull the sauce , big al ,
or monday morning , the city &apos;s here with a bulldozer ,
and your grandson goes to a school with a metal detector .
how do you know all this ?
what are you -- some kind of real @-@ estate agent ?
no . he &apos;s a realtor .
there is a difference somehow !
oh , hey , kids .
actually , i &apos;m waiting for sarah ,
so if i could have the room for just a -- a minute .
thank -- okay , funny .
whoever turned out the lights , please turn them back on .
they &apos;re not working . might be a fuse .
mitchell , we have a problem .
no , we don &apos;t .
i mean , unless you &apos;re busy that night .
are -- are you asking me to prom ?
well , you know , they need chaperones .
mitchell , this is the sweetest thing you &apos;ve ever done for me .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve mentioned it ,
but i never got to go to my own prom .
it &apos;s come up .
what about luke &apos;s promposal ?
well , your husband , who couldn &apos;t plan anything romantic
with a gun to his head ,
may have pulled off two promposals at once .
do you have any idea who put that note in my locker
asking me to be a part of this thing ?
oh , yeah , it was my uncle .
it &apos;s pretty clever how he turned out the lights .
i said , &quot; turned out the lights &quot; !
oh , my god ! yes !
that &apos;s so sweet . i ...
and i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m finally going to prom .
i can &apos;t believe i finally have a happy memory
in a high @-@ school gym .
joe did that to you ?
yeah .
slammed a car hood on it .
why ?
i owed him money .
it slipped while i was teaching him to check oil .
well , that &apos;s pretty advanced for a 3 @-@ year @-@ old .
what can i say ? i believe in my kids .
thank you .
looks good . thank you .
very nice .
let &apos;s quickly go over the plan .
my dad &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
we &apos;re doing this in stages .
one finger means you text him
&quot; we &apos;re closing the blinds division . &quot;
our biggest earner ?
he &apos;s gonna lose it if i tell him we &apos;re shuttering blinds .
two fingers , we &apos;re partnering with rod bushmill .
that sleazebag represents everything
your father spent an entire career fighting against .
three fingers , we &apos;re not going to closetcon . wha--
are you trying to teach your father a lesson
or crush his soul ?
just business , kid .
monster .
looks good . thank you .
so ... with all this prom stuff coming up ,
is your house as topsy @-@ turvy as ours is ?
not really . manny &apos;s taking this girl .
she &apos;s nothing special , but solid .
reliable .
a lot like our blinds division .
you know -- not sexy , but --
no , dad . no shop talk .
you &apos;ve had enough of that for a lifetime .
wow , your phone is really blowing up tonight .
two old @-@ fashioneds .
thank you .
oh , thank you .
okay . here .
you know what else seems old @-@ fashioned to me nowadays ?
mm ?
integrity .
maybe because i spent my career
fighting the sleazeballs in our industry .
you know -- the rod bushmill types .
rod &apos;s a sweetheart .
he bought me lunch last week .
we got to talking about whether or not we --
what am i doing ?
jibber @-@ jabbering about work .
so , that little grease monkey joe is 3 .
hard to believe . 3 .
they grow up so fast .
got to be nice , though , dad ,
knowing that your company is in good hands
and you can stay home all day long and just play with your kid .
have you lost your mind ?
well , not all day , obviously .
3 @-@ year @-@ olds are nothing but bipolar germ buckets .
you &apos;re skipping out on closetcon ?
who told you that ?
ben .
that little weasel told me everything .
listen , i can tolerate shutting down the blinds ,
even rod bushmill , but not showing up for closetcon ,
you &apos;re asking not to be taken seriously .
my god , claire !
we &apos;re one strong season away from being invited
to expo internationale du closets !
why are you looking at me like that ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not doing any of those things .
i told that little weasel ben to text you those things
when i found out that he was spying for you .
and , by the way , it doesn &apos;t feel very nice
to know that you don &apos;t think that i can run your company .
that &apos;s not why i did it .
i thought maybe you could use a little support .
you &apos;re staring down the barrel of your first closetcon .
so you spied on me ?
i mean , you could have given me a call .
and tell you that you &apos;re not doing your job ?
that would have gone over fine with you .
need any help ?
no !
no .
i mean , look at us .
why can &apos;t we both admit
that we could use each other &apos;s help right now ?
are we too proud to even do that ?
i &apos;ll admit it if you will .
fine . on 3 .
1 ... 2 ... 3 .
will you crack my lobster ?
i want to come back to work .
what ? !
damn it !
oh , my god . you want to come back to work ?
i miss it , okay ?
you know how it is when you have closets in your blood .
i &apos;m going crazy in retirement .
why are you smiling at me like that ?
because we &apos;re so similar .
do you know how many times i &apos;ve wanted to call you
to ask for your help or advice ,
but i was afraid i would look weak ?
here . you crack this .
give me that .
i &apos;ll open these things .
well , dad , what do you think about coming back to work --
i don &apos;t know -- one or two days a week ?
what i was thinking was , i &apos;d have a staff of five .
my own building .
what ?
and i report to no one .
i &apos;m kidding .
i &apos;ll put a desk in the copy room .
and , by the way , i &apos;ve known you for a long time .
the last thing you need to worry about is looking weak .
it &apos;s not always easy to ask for what you want ,
whether it &apos;s a little romance ...
or a little help ...
or a little respect .
so , i admire you for asking -- - i don &apos;t .
we both know why they &apos;re asking .
no , you may not use our upstairs apartment for an after party .
lame .
you look ravishing , my sweet .
we said no talking .
come on . come on .
i &apos;m thirsty .
i &apos;ll tell you when you &apos;re thirsty .
come on . let me feel that power .
come on . make that leather sing !
all right . come on . get on your bike .
back up . get on your bike . come on .
they can &apos;t hit you if they can &apos;t reach you .
my pants are falling .
well , pull &apos; em up .
pull &apos; em up high to your nipples .
that prevents a low blow .
what &apos;s a low blow ?
fantastic .
i have to emcee a poetry retrospective tomorrow ,
and this shawl collar &apos;s got more wrinkles
than last night &apos;s &quot; downton abbey . &quot;
that is .
