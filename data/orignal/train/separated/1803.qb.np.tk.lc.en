&quot; i saw her standing there &quot;
the clothes a surgeon wears
help to present an image .
the lab coats and badges and scrubs ...
all work together to indicate a person of authority ...
someone you can trust .
when the clothes come off , that &apos;s a different story .
we &apos;re sensitive ,
vulnerable ...
human ...
and just as prone to questionable judgment
as anybody else .
yes .
his hemoglobin is what ?
okay , so just--just do an m.r.i. and a hemoccult ,
and i &apos;ll be right in .
my idiot intern thinks she found a rare retroperitoneal tumor .
so now i have to go in and tell her that she &apos;s wrong .
well , i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll still be a wrong in 20 minutes .
i can take care of zola this morning .
i , um , i don &apos;t have to lecture until 10 : 00 .
still not sure it justifies the size of my paycheck .
you &apos;re a great teacher .
i should know . i was hot for teacher in my day .
oh , really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
so what is on the ol &apos; agenda today ?
oh , just catching up on , uh , thomas &apos; plan
for tomorrow &apos;s open p.d.a. ligation
and left main bypass .
i &apos;ve never seen one before .
yeah , that &apos;s because nobody &apos;s done it that way since 1993 .
how long do you suppose that &apos;s gonna take ?
17 hours give or take .
that &apos;s perfect .
what does that mean ?
nothing .
i have 20 minutes . want to go again ?
i guess so .
that was the last time .
we can &apos;t do this anymore .
no , no , we won &apos;t , because this is the last time , ever .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna get some coffee .
i &apos;m gonna go pray .
cool .
oh , morning , hunt . it &apos;s beautiful out there .
webber , what &apos;s with the tie ?
oh , just thought i &apos;d up my game a bit today .
yeah . where &apos;s yours ?
huh ? oh .
i had kind of a rough night .
got a spare .
oh , thanks .
don &apos;t mention it .
good morning , bailey .
what &apos;s with the tie ?
it felt like a tie kind of day .
oh , well , does it also feel like
a small bowel obstruction kind of day ?
i &apos;d be happy to have you scrub in .
oh , not this afternoon . i &apos;m busy .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
you have an appointment with your haberdasher ?
now what is so wrong with a man
taking a little pride in his appearance ?
hello , handsome .
oh , catherine , there you are .
yes , here i am .
mm . nice tie .
yeah , whatever &apos;s wrong , that &apos;ll fix it .
barnett decided everyone should create new passwords .
you do it in the settings menu .
but i @-@ i can &apos;t access the settings menu
without a new password .
so you &apos;re trying to break in ?
hey , probably gonna need to go back in
and do a redo o.r.i.f. on brody wright &apos;s humerus fracture , okay ?
when the hell is robbins coming back ?
wait , did you see her ? uh , did she see you ?
robbins is here ?
oh , damn it .
what ?
uh ... um , she &apos;s ...
she &apos;s being fitted for her first prosthetic today ,
which i wasn &apos;t supposed to tell you ,
because the only way i was able to get her to agree
to come in at all was to promise that no one knows she &apos;s here .
which makes two promises i &apos;ve broken ,
if you count the time i said ,
&quot; i promise you won &apos;t lose your leg , &quot;
which she certainly does .
i didn &apos;t see her .
good . don &apos;t .
tell her i hope it goes well .
no , i can &apos;t ,
because then she &apos;d know i told you she &apos;s here .
yeah , right .
do you need me to write this down ?
hey , dr.robbins.
good morning . david moore .
i &apos;m your prosthetist .
um , you know , we &apos;re--we &apos;re gonna be working together
for a while .
uh , you can all me david . um ...
can i call you arizona ?
what &apos;s a while ?
well , till one of us dies or your leg grows back .
yeah , that joke &apos;s always a risk .
which one of these is mine ?
uh , none of those , actually .
today we &apos;re just gonna get you started on a post @-@ op socket ,
and that &apos;ll give us a good idea
of what &apos;s most comfortable moving forward .
may i ?
oh , excellent .
you see how there &apos;s no scar tissue ?
that--that means it &apos;s healing well .
oh , great .
yeah , it is .
all right . uh , let &apos;s get to work ?
just stop having sex with him .
i am trying to fit in .
i live here now .
i have to just , you know , adapt .
so i &apos;m making friends .
but you don &apos;t even like him .
who says i have to like him ? he &apos;s my sex friend .
ew . well , what about the ancient guy ?
what about him ?
you want me to be sex friends with the ancient guy ?
no .
i want you to be regular friends with the ancient guy
and stop having sex friends in general .
i am regular friends with the ancient guy .
he , frankly , is my bestie .
he &apos;s my you here in minnesota .
well , how does the ancient minnesota me
feel about you being sex friends with parker ?
you know , it &apos;s no big deal . parker is fine .
a little reptilian , a little chatty , but fine .
this is a cry for help .
it &apos;s a cry for an orgasm .
and how &apos;s that working out ?
dr. grey , the radiologist report
does indicate a retrocrural mass ,
which means i could be right , right ? or not ?
holy crap .
what ?
i gotta go .
holy crap .
is it a big surprise ?
it &apos;s very big .
will i need to use two hands ?
two hands won &apos;t be enough .
dr. webber , does this bed go down at all ?
bryan , um , this is the urologist
that i was talking to you about .
this is dr. catherine avery .
before you say anything , uh ,
no , these aren &apos;t basketballs in my pockets ;
and , yes , i am very happy to see you .
surprise .
i don &apos;t understand why
you &apos;ve let it get this bad before seeking treatment .
he &apos;s using it as an excuse
to avoid our 10 @-@ year high school reunion .
paula , i am not .
he is .
it wasn &apos;t this bad before .
i mean , i @-@ i &apos;ve seen other doctors
who prescribed pills that never seemed to work .
then a few months ago , everything sort of just ...
blew up .
he wouldn &apos;t even have come if i hadn &apos;t dragged him .
i would have .
when ?
after the reunion .
bryan , there &apos;s no need to fear .
by the time we get finished with you ,
you &apos;ll be hitting that reunion with 98 % less scrotum .
dr. thomas , the p.d.a. was one thing ,
but now with the blockage , does that mean two surgeries ?
no , it means two procedures ,
both of which i propose to perform during one surgery .
we &apos;ll fix your p.d.a. from the side ,
then flip you over
and then open up your blocked arteries from the front .
flip me , spin me ... whatever you want .
if it means not feeling like
i &apos;m trapped in the body of an 80 year old anymore , i &apos;m in .
janet , believe me .
i know exactly how you feel .
because he &apos;s old . he &apos;s very , very old .
don &apos;t mistake dr. yang &apos;s disrespect for a sense of humor .
she hasn &apos;t got one .
oh , no , no , no .
i @-@ i respect you .
you &apos;re a historical landmark .
case in point .
like the grand canyon .
keep it up .
only--only older .
oh , all right . enough .
just a smidge .
oh , my god .
a smidge older than that .
i work out all the time ,
i read &quot; men &apos;s health , &quot;
and i don &apos;t eat anything i actually want .
and you &apos;re telling me i &apos;m gonna die ?
this tumor is difficult to resect . it &apos;s not impossible .
rob , you &apos;re in private security , right ?
yeah , i &apos;m a bodyguard .
all right . well , that &apos;s my job , too .
i have your back .
yeah , you know what ?
this tumor is just a little punk .
can i have some tissue , please ?
any questions ?
when you performed
that transcranial resection of clival chordoma in 2003,
did you realize you &apos;d become a major influence
on surgeons around the world ?
any questions about central lines ?
okay , look , i get that you went over this in med school .
but as interns ,
you &apos;re gonna be asked to insert central lines every day .
do it incorrectly , and the patient could die .
i could be watching a whipple right now .
i heard that dr. webber &apos;s has a patient with scrotal lymphedema .
scrotal lyphedema ?
stop .
ladies .
uh , dr. shepherd ,
i have a question about central lines .
great . go ahead .
in learning to insert your first central line ,
did you develop any of the skills that contributed
to your influential clival chordoma resection in 2003 ?
dr. yang , can i see you for a second , please ?
you know , i &apos;ll be right back .
is this gonna take long ?
just a quick question .
did you even try to suggest a less invasive approach ?
uh , yeah . of course i did . a hybrid surgery .
only one incision , done in half the time .
when ? when did you suggest it ?
i don &apos;t know . yesterday .
what did he say ?
uh , ah , he said ,
&quot; are we a hospital or a pizza delivery service ? &quot;
he asked if we needed it done in 30 minutes or less .
he is so stubborn .
yeah . uh , but he &apos;s not wrong .
i mean , his way minimizes the risk of recurrent shunt .
i mean , it &apos;s old @-@ school , but i never would &apos;ve thought--
got it . sounds great .
okay . so i can go back ?
yeah , go , go . enjoy it while you can .
what does that mean ?
will i be off probation soon ?
just go .
most men would just bring a girl flowers .
you know , this is a very dangerous game we &apos;re playing .
i &apos;ve done my best to keep jackson in the dark
about the further adventures of catherine and richard .
which is why i made sure to grab dr. quaid for the skin flap ,
there &apos;s no reason jackson needs to be in that o.r.
maybe that &apos;s a mistake .
i come into town to work on a case
that has a large plastics component
and don &apos;t bring him in ?
you saying , it seems suspicious ?
maybe .
oh , maybe not .
it &apos;s just like high school .
i know .
isn &apos;t it fun ?
ooh , when you said you were busy , you weren &apos;t kidding .
dr. bailey , how nice to see you .
uh , what happened to your small bowel obstruction ?
cleared up .
hey , you wouldn &apos;t need an extra set of hands
on those puppies , would you ?
um , w @-@ well , actually , i was , uh ,
hoping , uh , that april kepner could come aboard .
kepner ?
yeah , i &apos;m , you know , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m taking her under my wing .
she &apos;s fragile . y @-@ you understand .
that is a giant scrotum . i do not understand .
i &apos;m sorry , bailey .
um , n @-@ next time .
you &apos;re the prosthetist ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve always thought that &apos;d make a good title for a movie .
hey , david moore .
alex karev , peds .
um , if you &apos;re looking for dr. robbins ,
she &apos;s over in the clinic .
we &apos;re about to do a plaster cast of her residual limb .
but you &apos;ve got a few minutes .
oh , no , that &apos;s cool .
i was , uh , i was just hoping
that you could tell me how she &apos;s doing .
any scar tissue or contractures ?
no . so far , so good .
all right .
how soon before she &apos;s back up on her feet ?
that &apos;s a little harder to say .
i should have a better idea after tomorrow , though .
tell her you stopped by ?
no , no , don &apos;t , because , uh , i didn &apos;t .
all right . keep trying , folks .
nobody gets it the first time .
or the 40th time , apparently .
i just can &apos;t seem to locate the vein .
okay , give it to me .
i , uh ...
close your eyes .
visualize the anatomy .
subclavian vein is what you &apos;re looking for .
okay , walk it up the clavicle .
okay . watch on the angle . not too deep .
i see it .
mm . watch your angle .
boom .
that &apos;s arterial blood .
he &apos;s gonna bleed to death .
so not boom ?
no .
not boom .
you &apos;ve gotta work around the azygos
and the hemiazygos veins .
there &apos;s fatty tissue , lymph nodes , lymphatic tissue ,
and the sympathetic chains ,
not to mention the fact
that the tumor has lifted up the inferior vena cava
and is adherent to the aorta .
this is a mess .
i know .
so how do we get the entire mass
without having to resect the aorta ?
i have no idea .
yeah , i &apos;m happy to take this off your hands .
i called you for an opinion , not to steal my surgery .
n @-@ no first @-@ year attending in her right mind
is gonna want to take on something like this .
i mean , not when full responsibility
for every decision made in the o.r.
falls on her shoulders .
mine .
don &apos;t come crying to me
when a man &apos;s bleeding out on your table
just &apos; cause you think you bad .
oh , she &apos;s bad .
yeah , we &apos;ll see .
i still don &apos;t understand what it is i &apos;m looking at .
those are testicles , dr. kepner .
don &apos;t worry , sweetheart .
they &apos;re not supposed to look like that .
i know what testicles are s--
jackson didn &apos;t mention that you were coming .
he didn &apos;t know .
he made it very clear , he would like me
to stay out of his personal business ,
so i am doing my best .
well , i think that &apos;s great .
i &apos;ve made no such promises to you .
you need to start prepping for next year &apos;s boards .
there &apos;s a fellow in our gynecology department
that &apos;s an excellent tutor .
and he &apos;s cute .
that &apos;s--that &apos;s not really even nec--
i said it before , and i will say it again .
you &apos;re just too uptight , baby .
you need to get l @-@ a @-@ i @-@ d.
dr. avery .
look at me .
look at me .
i am having the best sex i have had in years .
and it &apos;s just opened me up like a flower ,
blossoming towards the sun .
that &apos;s a powerful image .
i bet that fellow knows his way around a woman .
oh , relax . i &apos;m kidding .
see that ? that &apos;s what i mean .
uptight .
but i will give you his number ,
just in case .
hey , dr. webber .
dr. webber .
um , yes , sir .
why is my name on tomorrow &apos;s o.r. schedule
for a scrotal lymphedema surgery with you ?
uh , got the wrong avery .
i &apos;m doing the surgery with your--your mother .
my mother &apos;s here
performing a surgery
with you ?
b @-@ but we were hoping that you &apos;d be available
to do a skin flap .
actually , she sent me to find you for a consult .
o @-@ okay , sure .
yeah , i &apos;ll just be a minute .
great .
just a few more minutes , okay ?
it &apos;s fine .
sorry . i thought you &apos;d be ready .
that &apos;s because you didn &apos;t check your voice mail .
you just looked to see who called .
if you had checked your freakin &apos; voice mail ,
then you would know that i was still gonna be here a while ,
because you would &apos;ve gotten the freakin &apos; message !
i &apos;ll come back .
you know , my--my brother ,
he never checks his voice mail either .
it &apos;s maddening .
derek must be so proud .
you &apos;ll be , like , mr. and mrs. impossible tumor .
but that &apos;s the problem .
i mean , he &apos;s not mr. impossible tumor anymore .
and i don &apos;t want to rub his nose in it .
he &apos;s trying to be so cheery about teaching .
aw . that &apos;s so sad .
it &apos;s not sad . it &apos;s just an adjustment .
can you imagine never doing surgery again ?
i can . i do .
i mean , he didn &apos;t see this coming .
so i just try to enjoy it while i can .
oh , my god . he doesn &apos;t see it coming .
oh , my god . thanks , mer . i gotta go .
okay .
oh , i hate teaching .
you love teaching .
i just never realized how much i rely on
just having them be able to watch me do the thing .
well , i used to love it when you stood behind me
and whispered instructions in my ear .
well , i can &apos;t do that with all the kids .
how are you ?
yes , i know .
so i &apos;m guessing your intern didn &apos;t like finding out
she was wrong about the tumor .
no , she didn &apos;t like it at all .
this is the last time .
the last time was the last time .
yeah , but this is the last last time .
i have to be in the o.r.
all day tomorrow with your mom .
you &apos;re in that surgery , too ?
what do you mean , too ?
wait . you &apos;re gonna be there ?
yeah . no , no , no .
we cannot both be in that o.r.
she &apos;s gonna figure it out .
she is obsessed with my sex life .
she &apos;s having amazing sex , so i have to , too .
sorry . sorry . you don &apos;t want to hear that .
webber &apos;s still banging my mom .
that &apos;s who she called the best sex of her life ?
and we &apos;re done here .
white wine .
what kind ?
the big kind ?
torres , it &apos;s late .
yeah .
well , you know how they say
one of the biggest things couples fight about is money ?
turns out money fights
ain &apos;t got nothing on an amputation fight .
i can imagine .
yeah , but i can &apos;t get mad or yell ,
because then i &apos;m the woman yelling at her one @-@ legged wife .
so i &apos;ve been sleeping at mark &apos;s ,
i don &apos;t think i can take another night
in my dead best friend &apos;s bed .
it just reminds me that he &apos;s gone ,
and i end up having the worst dreams .
it &apos;s getting so bad , i even considered asking shepherd
if i could crash in his trailer in the woods .
mm . that &apos;s pretty bad .
yep .
sorry . that was a lot .
oh , i asked .
i &apos;m not sure you did .
it &apos;s fine .
honestly ...
i haven &apos;t been sleeping too well , either .
want another ?
uh , yeah .
yeah ?
yeah .
he &apos;ll have another .
not to add insult to injury ,
but that &apos;s the worst tie i &apos;ve ever seen .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , coming .
well , hey there .
uh , i didn &apos;t know we , uh--
we &apos;re not . what &apos;s your deal with dr. thomas ?
you came here to talk about craig thomas ?
well , color me disappointed .
you said , &quot; enjoy him while you can . &quot;
what does that mean ?
come on in .
it &apos;s cold .
are you firing him ?
we can &apos;t fire him .
we can ...
force him to retire , though .
listen , telling you this
breaks a whole bushel of board regulations .
tell me one mistake he &apos;s made .
he hasn &apos;t . not yet .
but when he does ,
his age will make it an instant malpractice suit
that we will lose .
he &apos;s years behind the medical education curve .
you said it yourself .
he refused to try a minimally invasive technique .
why ,
because he &apos;s stubborn
or because he doesn &apos;t know how ?
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve had me working with him .
well , yeah , you represent everything that is
new and smart and advanced in our field .
you &apos;re his opposite .
and when the time comes to make a case ,
it won &apos;t hurt to have you help us do it .
you should &apos;ve told me .
ethically , no .
ethically , yes .
you should have .
honestly , i never would &apos;ve thought
you &apos;d have a problem with it .
i can &apos;t see anything .
you described them as ,
&quot; so big , a sheet couldn &apos;t cover them . &quot;
i may have exaggerated .
okay , ladies , this isn &apos;t a sideshow .
gentlemen , step right up .
that &apos;s it ?
okay .
that &apos;s not okay .
oh , great . karev &apos;s here .
here to make us all laugh with funny jokes
about my hands on a man &apos;s parts .
this isn &apos;t funny . that poor guy .
i know .
can you imagine becoming so swollen
that a surgeon needs to use a scalpel
to dig out all that excess tissue
until the testicles and cords hit the open air ?
i mean , who even knows what happened to his penis in all that mess ?
that &apos;s not okay .
nice .
your mother won &apos;t stop asking me why i look so tired .
why do you look so tired ?
they look so cute together .
shut up .
think they look tired ?
go to hell .
the hybrid surgery was a good pitch .
yes , it was .
so why aren &apos;t we doing it ?
because we have a surgical plan .
do you have a problem , dr. yang ?
nope . but i think you do .
i think you reject my pitches because they scare you .
i thought you were learning something from me .
i have .
i have learned that mortality is breathing down your neck ,
and you are running from the future
like a scared old chicken .
i won &apos;t change my plan just because ...
won &apos;t or can &apos;t ?
i &apos;m perfectly capable of threading a catheter , dr. yang .
prove it . prove me wrong .
take a deep breath for me , bryan .
good . and let it out .
wh @-@ what about my recovery time ?
i mean , is there any chance
i won &apos;t be able to walk for a while ?
god , bryan .
stop hiding from amy miller .
i &apos;m not .
she probably won &apos;t even be at the reunion .
she will . sheryl thompson told me so .
also said she &apos;s single .
you &apos;re not that skinny kid from rocketry club anymore .
you &apos;re smart . you &apos;re funny . you &apos;re good enough for amy .
actually , you &apos;re too good for amy .
you would be the perfect guy except ...
except i &apos;ve got giant balls ?
no !
except that you don &apos;t .
it &apos;s a good trade , grey .
my two leisurely abdominal surgeries
for just one retrocrural tumor .
this is getting a little sad .
no , i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s sad .
meredith grey flaming out &apos; cause she doesn &apos;t know
a good bargain when she sees one .
stop , mr. mays .
mr. mays !
mr. mays , stop !
should &apos;ve made the trade .
dr. bailey .
hey , i might be interested in a trade .
he &apos;s right over there .
i mean , do i call for backup ? do i get a net or what ?
forget it .
i would operate out here ,
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s particularly sterile .
you lied to me .
i didn &apos;t .
that intern was in the hallway
bragging to all her little friends
about my once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ career tumor .
she said you didn &apos;t even know where you were gonna start .
with a tumor like this , no surgeon would
until you &apos;re open and on the table
and i can get a look at the thing .
yeah , well , that &apos;s terrifying .
i know . that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you .
you &apos;re an emotional guy .
not usually .
i mean , at work , i &apos;m in dangerous situations all the time .
but then , you know , it &apos;s all about the client .
so i &apos;m not allowed to freak out .
but right now , i &apos;m freaking out .
okay . well , today you &apos;re allowed , because i won &apos;t .
th @-@ that intern &apos;s got a big mouth .
yeah . tell me about it .
dr. torres .
did you hear anything about robbins &apos; fitting ?
i mean , moore said ...
you spoke to moore ?
i told you not to do that . if she &apos;d seen you ...
look , i &apos;m the one who cut off her leg .
if she has a problem adjusting to the prosthetic
or if turns out she &apos;s gotta have more surgery ...
i mean , what if i screwed it up ?
she even blames me for being on the plane .
she doesn &apos;t blame you , karev .
she doesn &apos;t even know you made the cut .
i made the call , okay ? i was supposed to protect her .
i &apos;m the bad doctor , the bad person .
your name never comes up .
now if this doesn &apos;t feel right ,
i can adjust it
or ... or we can try a whole new cast .
it &apos;s fine .
don &apos;t rush this .
if it &apos;s not right , you &apos;re the one that suffers , not me .
okay , let &apos;s get you up on your feet .
no , that &apos;s fine . i don &apos;t need to ...
i need to see you take a few steps .
let &apos;s see how it feels when you put some weight on it , all right ?
no . hey , let go !
arizona , you ... you can &apos;t do this on your own .
you need help .
if we do this right and we ...
and we get you on a prosthetic that fits ,
you &apos;ll need less ,
but you are not there yet .
and , you know ,
you &apos;re very lucky to have people in your corner that care .
you should let them help .
you &apos;re like a gift from god .
i ... i was talking about me . i barely know you .
i &apos;m here because this ... this is my job .
i have plenty of other things i could be doing right now .
yeah ? well , why don &apos;t you go do them ?
you know , i think i will .
okay , folks . let &apos;s get started .
um ... dr. shepherd .
yeah .
we were wondering if , instead of a lecture , we might be able to
watch dr. grey remove that rare tumor .
dr. grey is not removing a rare tumor .
yeah , she is .
no , she &apos;s not .
but she and dr. brooks are in o.r. one right now .
what did you say to him ?
who ?
thomas .
because , you know , legally ,
i could get in a lot of trouble for telling you about the ...
i didn &apos;t say anything . it was his idea .
really ?
he just suddenly changes his mind
and goes with an approach he rejected two days ago ?
i know . i was surprised , too .
i was , like , &quot; whoa , what a surprise . &quot;
okay .
no , actually , maybe we lucked out .
i &apos;ve never seen him use one of those .
i wouldn &apos;t even allow it if i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be in there
to take over when he craps out .
when he does , it might just be all the board needs
to proceed with his dismissal .
dr. yang .
suction .
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re just such a badass .
and i shouldn &apos;t have been bragging ,
but i @-@ i liked feeling like one , too .
if i was a real badass ,
i would &apos;ve just kept my mouth shut ,
been stoic , silent .
yeah . why don &apos;t you try that ?
more suction , please .
i can &apos;t get good visualization .
that &apos;s a big tumor .
yeah , it is .
she didn &apos;t even tell me about it .
i found out through one of my interns .
my wife is bubble wrapping me .
shepherd , you have a reputation
for needing to be bubble wrapped .
excuse me ?
you fight for your patients against the worst possible odds ,
but when things get messy personally ,
you &apos;re gone ...
off to the woods to drink and grow a beard .
and with everything that &apos;s happened ,
and this lawsuit keeping it all alive ,
maybe she just ...
worried that the slightest little thing
is gonna make you run off to that trailer ,
and leave her alone in the house you gave her ,
not sleeping at night ,
because whichever room she lays down in ,
she just can &apos;t get away from the fact that you &apos;re just not there .
sounds like you had that all teed up and ready to go .
yeah . yeah , well , a version of it .
it &apos;s meant for somebody else , you know ,
but , uh , it kind of works here , too .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;s coming back .
no .
no , i don &apos;t .
here it is .
where do we start ?
we need to identify the testicles and the cords .
don &apos;t want to damage them .
yes , ma &apos;am .
i &apos;ll keep my eyes peeled .
i &apos;m having the best time .
forceps .
what &apos;s with the face ?
i &apos;m not making a face .
i &apos;ve spent a few thousand hours looking at you with a mask on .
i know when you &apos;re making a face .
bailey , i &apos;m not making a face .
just so you know , i did not bully
april kepner into giving up this surgery .
she approached me .
so ... nuts to her .
get it ? nuts to her ?
oh , come on . you get it .
i &apos;m a urologist , dr. bailey . of course i get it .
hey , i spend most of my day in a bowel ,
doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t laugh at a fart .
oh , tough room .
oh , hey , avery , knock , knock .
i think i just located the left testicle .
yes , you have .
i will continue to excise the surrounding tissue .
if someone can just get a hand underneath ...
yeah .
oh . uh , sorry .
no , no , no . please . go ahead .
no , i insist .
oh , for pete &apos;s sake . it &apos;s just a little testicle .
somebody get up in there .
of all the organs in the body ,
of course it had to be this one .
damn .
damn it .
you know , i &apos;m pretty sure no one &apos;s ever closed a p.d.a.
by swearing at the catheter .
i don &apos;t need any tips , thank you .
i &apos;ve used a guide wire before .
really ?
was that before or after you learned
to use sheep &apos;s blood to lift a witch &apos;s curse ?
would you be quiet ?
damn .
just relax .
i can &apos;t pass the wire . you @-@ you &apos;d better take over .
here .
your @-@ your right wrist .
what about it ?
just turn it in , like this .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
just @-@ just try it . try it .
all right . all right .
that &apos;s all , huh ?
that &apos;s pretty neat .
if you &apos;d like , i can advance the balloon for you .
back off , sister . eyes on your own work .
you okay ?
what are you doing here ?
i was looking for moore .
it looks great .
incision &apos;s healed well . no edema .
you haven &apos;t completely destroyed my department , have you ?
me ?
i &apos;m the one thing that &apos;s kept that place together .
this guy , barnett , is a one @-@ man wrecking crew .
we need you back .
i &apos;m trying .
you ... you know , callie &apos;s trying , too .
boy , that went like gangbusters in there .
it did , huh ?
you could look a little less disappointed .
the guy &apos;s a historical treasure .
that &apos;s funny .
no , it &apos;s not .
you &apos;re right .
but on the bright side ,
you &apos;re out of surgery sooner than expected .
what do you say to a little , uh--
i &apos;m meeting a friend for drinks .
nice .
that &apos;s nice . you &apos;re making friends .
well--
good night .
it &apos;s a little loose .
and it-- and it pinches right here .
and it hurts a little there .
okay .
well , let me see what we can do about that .
dr. shepherd .
i was visualizing the anatomy all wrong .
but if i just do it the way you told me ...
excellent work .
keep going .
it &apos;s , uh , not so hopeless after all .
hey , you-- you got a second ?
yeah .
good news , bryan .
the procedure went as planned .
amy miller &apos;s got a lot to look forward to .
you know , it &apos;s really not about amy .
but paula and i have been friends for so long ,
i &apos;ve never really known how to say it .
son , uh , it &apos;s none of my business ,
but i don &apos;t think you oughta be ashamed of your feelings .
seems to me we just surgically removed
the only thing you had to be embarrassed about .
hey .
there &apos;s a whole lot less of you under that blanket .
would you mind ?
no , not at all .
think we &apos;ll get invited to the wedding ?
hey .
i need a moment to talk to dr. webber , man to man .
oh , no . no , you don &apos;t .
mom .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s all right .
well , all right , then .
all right , here &apos;s the deal .
i understand
how two people can be drawn together
even though they know it &apos;s incredibly wrong
and it &apos;s something that shouldn &apos;t have happened .
sex is a powerful force .
all right , look ...
you hurt my mom , and i hurt you .
i wouldn &apos;t hurt your mom .
i like her .
and i don &apos;t like that you like her .
well , man to man ,
you &apos;re just gonna have to deal with it .
you don &apos;t want a piece of this .
not today .
i &apos;m watching you .
i hope you like the view .
i know what you &apos;re thinking .
i &apos;m married .
i haven &apos;t forgotten that .
actually , i was thinking that all of that over there
took some pretty big balls .
how was your day ?
fine .
how about the tumor ?
i was in the gallery .
that was no big deal .
i &apos;m not gonna grow a beard
and run off and live in the woods anymore .
if you have a good day , i want to hear about it .
it was amazing , actually .
i didn &apos;t know where the hell to start .
i stood there staring at the thing forever .
i knew that supraceliac aorta was gonna be a bitch to get around .
and i couldn &apos;t risk clamping
without killing off the gut and the kidneys .
and then finally , it just came to me .
mattox maneuver .
that &apos;s a trauma move .
right , and it exposed the other side of the kidney ,
and well-- i had perfect visualization .
what is that for ?
contact high . i might not come down for hours .
okay , uh , sofia &apos;s down for the night .
and , uh , i &apos;ll be at mark &apos;s if you need anything .
&quot; american bake @-@ off &quot; is on in a few minutes .
it might be hard for a surgeon to admit ...
but there &apos;s no shame in simply being human .
it can be a relief to stop hiding ,
to accept who you really are
and let the world see you that way , too .
mom .
you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
are you sure ?
yeah .
want to have sex ?
yeah .
a little self @-@ awareness never hurt anybody .
i know they &apos;re trying to push me out .
got this watch at a surprise retirement party
four years ago .
i mean , it &apos;s a piece of junk .
but i wear it just to screw with them .
they are so polite .
they don &apos;t dare say anything directly , you know ?
it &apos;s been a while since i &apos;ve had anyone
who cared enough to give me grief .
um , i &apos;ll have another tequila ,
and , uh , something that contains actual alcohol
for my friend here .
oh , no , it &apos;s late .
it &apos;s , like , 10 : 15 . have a drink .
okay .
i &apos;ll have , um ...
an old fashioned .
what ?
really ? an old-- you know what ?
i &apos;ll have two . two . make it two old fashioneds .
there you go .
old fashioned .
because when you know who you are ,
it &apos;s easier to know what you &apos;re about .
and ultimately ...
