第五季 第十六集
Kalinda?
Eli, I need to speak with Alicia.
Is she there with you?
She's on the dais.
She can't come now. What's wrong?
Eli, I need to speak to her.
Kalinda...
She's in the middle of the correspondence luncheon.
Eli...
Will is dead.
When you start talking about medical marijuana,
everybody gets tense.
There was a shooting in the courthouse
and he got caught up in the cross fire.
I need to speak to Alicia.
Yes. Just a second.
... each and every one of you, you know,
but I'm here to tell you that, after...
There's a call for you.
Now?
Yes, you have to take it.
I mean, yeah, I could, I could tell he...
Now, I know that you guys have been waiting for the governor.
Hello.
Alicia... it's me.
Yes. Kalinda, what's wrong?
Will's been shot.
He... wh-what do you mean?
There was, uh, gunfire at the courthouse
and... he was shot.
Will... um...
I-I don't understand, by who?
His client, uh... I'm in the hospital and...
Will is dead.
Fine, no ice cream for you...
I'm sorry, Alicia. He...
He was killed.
I... can't...
I... um... no.
But I just saw him yesterday.
Alicia, uh... I'll call you back.
I need to speak to the police,
then I will call you back.
I'm sorry.
It is an honor to be here
and I want to introduce to you right now,
the First Lady of Illinois.
I'll introduce Peter. You-you go.
You're in no condition, Alicia.
Go ahead.
And the First Lady had to step outside.
Uh, Mr. Gold?
Do you want to do the honors?
Th-Thank you, Bobby.
It's my honor
to introduce the man I've shared my...
uh... m-many campaigns with over the past few years.
We've had good times...
and bad...
and we've had our share of disagreements.
Who takes out the garbage.
Who changes the diapers.
What is he doing?
Which brings me to a funny story about how I chose this...
outfit for today.
Where's Alicia?
Is everything all right?
I need to speak to the partners.
Yes. They're ready.
They've been wondering where you were.
It's the vote on the L.A. office.
Tell them I'll be right in.
I thought this meeting was at 2:00.
I have a client waiting.
What did we decide?
We haven't decided anything yet.
What is going on, Diane?
We're late here.
Yes, I'm sorry.
We've had a situation.
At the courthouse.
What, what, what'd I miss?
Will was shot.
What?
He-he-he was what?
I've just come from the hospital.
Will was sh... Will Gardner?
Yes.
He's dead.
What?
Oh, my God.
Will is dead?
Apparently some sort of shooting has taken place
within one of the courtrooms.
Details are sketchy at this point...
Get out.
Get out!
Ben Collins called for Will.
He heard there was a shooting at the courthouse.
Who is that?
Gail. The new intern.
How long has she been here?
A week?
Are you done?
Excuse me?
Are you done crying?
I... I don't know.
Get your things and go home.
What?
Take your things from your desk.
Leave here. Go home.
And don't come back.
Alpha Five, that's gonna be SWAT's call--
if they want to get an escort through there...
Can you confirm the roof access is secure?
Yeah?
I'm, I'm here.
I need your help.
Yeah, I see you.
Excuse me.
Thanks, she's with me.
You weren't paying attention at all, were you?
So what happened next?
I was just standing there...
and I turned around and... he had a gun.
Who had a gun? The defendant?
Yeah. Jeffrey Grant.
He had your gun?
Yeah, but I don't know how.
A witness said he saw you on your cell phone.
No.
I mean, I got a text. I looked at a text,
because my girlfriend, she's pregnant.
Do you usually text during court?
I didn't text.
I got a text.
When you heard the first shot, what did you see?
The kid, Jeffrey Grant, he was...
Did you try to get your gun back?
No.
Why not?
What? You're kidding me.
Unbelievable.
You weren't there.
The kid was just firing everywhere!
So, what'd you do?
Witness said you dove behind the first bench in the gallery.
Is that true?
You okay?
Where's Jeffrey Grant?
They're holding him.
Here?
It's not gonna make a difference.
Jenna...
Jeffrey Grant, our client?
Yes.
He was on trial for murder.
Yes.
But he...
That was supposed to be my case.
Diane, do you have a minute?
Sorry, I'll be right back.
I'm sorry, Alicia.
Thank you.
Where are you?
I'm at Lockhart/Gardner...
Alicia, what are you doing?
The deposition is now.
We promised to give Candace our full attention.
We can't just... What are you...?
What are you doing at Lockhart/Gardner?
Cary...
Will is dead.
What do you mean?
He was shot during his trial. He's dead.
We have to delay the deposition.
I'm-I'm, I'm-I'm just, I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm...
I have to go.
Alicia?
Are you all right?
I'll call you back, Cary.
Is she coming?
Where is she?
I... um...
We need to delay this, Candace.
What?
I have to call Will's clients.
It's not out yet that Will is dead,
but when it is, the clients will be looking around.
David, please.
But more importantly,
other firms will be poaching.
David, my best friend just died.
Diane, I'm sorry.
I-I don't want to be doing this any more than you do,
but the car is moving, and someone has to drive.
I'm just asking your permission to break it to the clients.
All right.
Just... do what you do.
Alicia, please call me as soon as you can.
There's something I need to tell you.
Alicia, it's Diane.
We're trying to get ahold of you.
Please call.
Alicia...
Mr. Gardner, we're just about ready here.
H-Hold on, Your Honor.
I'll call you back.
手机 上午11:32
Alicia.
Mr. Gardner, we're just about ready here.
H-Hold on, Your Honor.
I'll call you back.
手机 上午11:32
I have no idea why he would call.
He called at 11:30.
Wasn't he in court?
They must've been on a break.
Was he upset?
At?
Me?
No. Why?
Candace came to our firm.
We poached her just yesterday.
She was Will's client.
Will had dealt with all of that.
You sure?
You can blame yourself for anything you want,
but Will was...
He was moving fast on a lot of fronts.
He was...
I loved him.
I know.
He loved you.
You can stay if you want.
No.
Alicia.
This feud, it's stupid.
I-I care about you too much to let it come...
Alicia, are you kidding me?
Leave my clients alone, Alicia.
Find your own.
But you do admit to taking the sheriff's gun?
You were angry about Dr. Delaney's testimony?
His false testimony.
We'd rather hear it from your client.
You were angry about Dr. Delaney's testimony?
The accused nodded in assent.
But he was lying, right, Jeffrey?
He was the real killer.
I-I didn't kill her.
I didn't kill Dani.
But Professor Delaney did?
Why'd you kill your lawyer, Jeffrey?
I don't think that's been proved.
Jeffrey, why did you shoot at your own lawyer?
I want to make clear, I have been hired by the Grant family
to represent Jeffrey's interests.
There's no evidence that Jeffrey was the cause
of Mr. Gardner's death.
According to witnesses,
there was a hail of gunfire from other SWAT
and sheriff members on the scene,
and the bullets that killed Mr. Gardner may have...
Gentlemen,
let's step out for a moment.
I want to say my client has been wrongly accused.
He was placed into a corner by faulty DNA evidence
of the Cook...
Could you back up a bit?
We anticipate a suit against this jurisdiction.
Your client killed two people in that court.
In a fit of uncontrollable rage...
He's not getting off.
...by reason of insanity.
Don't question my client outside my presence.
Kalinda, what are you thinking?
Uh, no, no, no. All joking aside,
Illinois only works
if we can put aside our differences
and work together, everybody.
I mean, it's-it's really that simple.
And that's what I plan to do.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find out
what Eli Gold meant by changing my kids' diapers.
Eli, what's going on?
You have to greet the press.
No, you need to tell me what's going on right now.
If I tell you what's going on,
you won't want to greet the press.
This is about Will?
What?
This is about Will.
No.
What do you mean?
Alicia's gonna talk to him and convince him
not to testify against me.
Peter, I can tell you quite definitively,
Alicia is not gonna...
Will is dead.
There was gunfire at the courthouse.
Will was shot by a client.
You have to talk to the reporters.
No, I have to... I have to call Alicia.
I don't think that's a good idea.
I need to speak to my wife.
This is Alicia Florrick.
Please leave a message.
Alicia.
Mr. Gardner, we're just about ready here.
H-Hold on, Your Honor.
I'll call you back.
Mrs. Florrick.
Yes.
Your Honor, do you have a moment?
It's not, uh...
I was about to go home.
It's about Will.
We're just asking for a 48-hour delay.
A delay in the deposition?
Yes, there's been an emergency.
The deposition that was already delayed?
Yes, but that was by another law firm.
Alicia Florrick has had to deal with a death close to her.
Oh. Well, I'm sorry,
but, uh,
we're not giving you 48 hours.
We have a window now. Take it
or wait another six months to depose.
Don't be a schmuck.
Here's the thing,
I am a schmuck.
Tell her if she wants to go to a funeral, go,
but there's a price.
Wait another six months to depose,
or, Candace,
you could settle this right now.
Five cents on the dollar.
What do you want to do?
Let's do it right now.
It was a recess.
Mr. Gardner and Mr. Polmar
thought they could reach a plea bargain,
so I recessed just before lunch.
And you passed them in the hall?
And Will was on his phone?
Yeah.
He left me a voice mail on my phone.
Mr. Polmar might know what he was calling about.
He was with him; I didn't hear.
Yeah?
What happened in court?
Why do want to know, Mrs. Florrick?
The accused got a gun from the sheriff.
We were at a sidebar at the bench.
He hit the witness, killed him.
Mr. Gardner tried to intervene
and take the gun, and he was hit next.
Mr. Polmar covered him with his body.
Uh, Mr. Polmar?
A.S.A. Polmar.
He's new; he was brought in from New York.
He, uh, stayed with Will the whole time,
and he dragged him over to the table.
There was gunfire all over.
The sheriffs were firing back at the accused,
and Mr. Polmar was shot
dragging Will out of the cross fire.
Polmar stayed with him the whole time?
Yes, till the paramedics arrived.
He kept talking to him and...
holding his hand.
Do you know what hospital he's at?
It's being noticed.
Let me use your phone.
Why?
'Cause I'm the governor,
and I'm asking to use your phone.
Show me how to dial Alicia.
It won't mean anything.
What? If she picks up your call but not mine?
That won't mean anything?
Eli, not now.
No, it's not Eli.
It's me. I, uh, tried you on my phone.
I couldn't reach you.
Sorry.
I had my phone off.
I-I just, I just took it out now.
I just called to tell you that I'm sorry.
I heard about Will.
Thank you.
Where are you?
I'm at...
Chicago General Hospital.
Is that where he is?
No, um, I don't... I don't know where...
Who's there? Diane?
No, the prosecutor.
Uh, he-he was... shot, too.
That's terrible.
Terrible.
How long are you gonna be there?
I don't know.
Well, I-I'm gonna come to you.
No.
Alicia, I'm coming to you.
Peter,
I'm fine. Please, I-I'm fine.
I'm your husband, and I should be there.
Yes, and you're the governor.
Wherever you go, there's an entourage,
and I can't deal with that right now.
Yeah, okay.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
Is she all right?
You called Justice?
You called Agent Dubeck about a half hour ago?
Yes.
Don't.
Don't what? I'm just doing...
No, you're not.
This is about Will being dead, right?
And now that he's dead,
Justice has no case against me, right?
Yes.
Can we just take a minute?
Can you just stop and not think about the angles right now?
Peter, don't scold me for trying to protect you.
You don't think I want to be doing something else?
Yeah, you're right.
I apologize.
What room is Finn Polmar in?
Chicago General Hospital, may I help you?
It was all a mistake.
Can you believe it? They thought it was me
because the body was shot in the face.
Sorry, may I help you?
Polmar. Finn Polmar's room.
You're looking for Finn?
Yes.
I'm Maria, his assistant.
He's in surgery right now,
but he should be out pretty soon.
You're...
Alicia Florrick.
I just wanted to see if he was all right.
Mrs. Florrick.
He's much better now, thanks.
How do you know Finn?
I...
don't, really.
I knew Will.
Oh, my God, of course.
I am sorry.
It was so weird to be with him today,
and now this.
You were in court?
No.
In the, uh, plea bargain.
Did Will...
step out to make a call in the middle
of the plea bargain session?
Yeah.
He made a phone call?
Yes.
Do you know why?
No, but it wasn't good.
What do you mean?
He was angry.
Really pissed.
Someone was stealing his clients,
and he was calling them about it.
I had to go out and interrupt him.
I-I told him that Finn was ready.
It was sad.
Want me to tell Finn you dropped by?
No, that's all right.
There's one problem.
I called Bob Klepper.
He wants to hear from you before he considers staying.
Oh, dear God.
I wouldn't have bothered you with this,
but he's one of Will's...
Top clients, I know.
I will see him tomorrow.
He said today or he'll start making calls.
Do ever think we chose the wrong profession?
I'll ask if he'll take a call.
No, tell him to come in.
That's what Will would do.
So this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding,
Dr. Levine?
Yes.
I fired Candace because of performance.
That's all.
Thank you, Doctor.
Anything, Cary?
Mr. Agos?
When was the last time you had sex with your wife?
Come on, Cary, relevance.
The fine, upstanding doctor said
he was happily married,
and that's why he didn't fire my client because she was too pretty.
I'm just examining the truth of his contention.
Nah, this is pure harassment.
When was the last time you had sex with your massage therapist?
Okay, that's outrageous.
Are you serious?
Totally irrelevant to the case.
Here's an affidavit from Beverly Jensen admitting
you had sex on five separate occasions.
This deposition's over.
Let's get the judge on the line.
Dr. Levine has a patient,
so we're gonna need to delay this after all.
You're the one who went to the judge
insisting the deposition could only be today!
So let's get the judge on the line,
but I don't think he's gonna be in a giving mood!
What do you want?
I want to get out my aggressions and my anger
by destroying your client.
Now sit down.
I said sit the hell down.
Hey, Jenna, Kalinda.
I'm sorry about this.
How many wounds?
Three, all Glocks, G19.
The same gun?
No, don't know.
G19 seems to be the sheriff gun of choice.
What's going on, Kalinda?
We're trying to figure out how Mr. Gardner died.
Was it from Jeffrey Grant or the cross fire?
I'll have the report out tomorrow.
We don't want to wait.
The bullet to the thorax was the one that killed him.
The other two shots,
the one to the right shoulder and the stomach,
they were survivable. It was the first.
And who shot the first?
Why?
Because I want to know.
The shot to the thorax was from close range.
Close range meant it came from the accused,
Jeffrey Grant.
Okay, thanks.
Let me see him.
No need.
I have the family coming in for an I.D.
Kurt, just let me see him.
Hey, Kalinda?
Jenna, just give me a second, please.
Yeah.
Yeah?
I'm going crazy.
I know.
I...
I don't know what to do, Kalinda.
I have to go.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
It sounds like you do know.
Don't worry.
I'll see you later, Alicia.
Thank you, Mr. Klepper, for coming in.
You can understand this has been a difficult day.
I do.
I loved Will.
He was my lawyer for eight years.
Diane, how are you doing?
Not good.
I'm sorry. Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Let me make something clear up front.
I want to stay,
but with this product manufacturing lawsuit,
I need to know where we stand.
Well, Diane is best to talk to then.
Good.
So, you'll be able to take over for Will.
I will,
but instead i'm going to fire you as a client.
What?
You're no longer a client here.
I'm not?
You're not.
Uh, I can go to Lake & Tordello.
Yes, I know that; that's why I talked to them.
They won't take you.
They will.
No. They don't like the way you've... handled this.
Florrick/Agos solicited me.
Yes, I know, and I just talked to Cary.
He won't take you either.
They liked Will.
They don't like you.
Okay. I'll give you a few days
and then we'll talk.
No, you're fired, Mr. Klepper.
You don't belong here anymore as a client.
We'll transfer your files to your home.
This is insane.
Do you know how much business I bring in here?
I do.
That's what makes this so difficult.
It's not what Will would do.
If I were dead,
it's exactly what Will would do.
That felt good.
Turned me on.
Mom?
I'm so sorry.
I know you don't believe it,
but he's, um, he's with God.
What does that mean, Grace?
He's in Heaven with angels and clouds?
I don't know.
I, I don't think you can really picture it.
But you believe it?
Why do you think Will is in Heaven?
He was a good person, wasn't he?
He...
He did some bad things,
but he did them because...
because he wanted to be good.
Well, then he's in Heaven.
I can't believe that, Grace.
Why?
You think God is good?
I don't find any good here.
A kid picked up a gun, didn't even mean to shoot Will.
It's just some stupid accident.
What does... what does it mean?
Well, what does it mean if there is no God?
Why is that any better?
It's not better.
It's just truer.
It's just not wishful thinking.
Well, maybe always believing the bad,
maybe that's wishful thinking, too.
Mom, I just want you to be happy.
I will. I will eventually.
Okay, I have to get this.
Hello.
Mrs. Florrick?
Yes.
This is Finn Polmar.
Oh, uh, yes.
How are you?
Uh, a bit loopy. The painkillers...
Uh, Maria said you wanted to talk to me about Will,
about our last conversation.
Yes, but that can wait till tomorrow.
Well, why tomorrow?
I'm up all night.
What do you need, Jenna?
Uh, just stretching my legs.
What about you? Why do they got you here?
Suicide watch.
Every 30 minutes.
Kid who shot up the court?
Yeah.
Watching anybody else?
A few cells at the other end.
Why don't you go take a look?
It's my responsibility.
Now it's mine.
Why'd you do it?
You killed my friend.
I didn't mean to.
You shot him.
You didn't mean to, but you shot him.
You want to die?
I have your belt.
I took it from Property.
The guard will be away for ten minutes.
That'll give you enough time.
What are you doing?
No, you're gonna live with this.
You know Will was a good man,
and I loved him,
and he was trying to help you.
So you live with that.
No.
No, no, no, no, please.
No.
Please.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Finn.
Alicia.
I guessed.
I would ask you to sit, but I am in the only chair.
No, no, you can sit on the bed.
No, I'm fine.
Are you in pain?
Well, not tonight, but tomorrow will be interesting.
Sorry, the painkillers...
Oh, no, don't-don't be sorry.
You're reading Cicero?
No, no, that was a-a joke from my assistant.
I have no idea what it means,
but I will be asking her tomorrow.
No, we're good.
Um, so, uh...
you knew Will.
I did.
I liked him.
I liked him a lot.
He-he really had me at the trial.
I was losing.
I heard you tried to save him.
Yes, that wasn't too smart, was it?
Thank you.
Yeah, he kept, um...
I don't know.
Uh, could, uh...
could you pass me the water?
I thank you.
Yeah, he, uh,
he kept moving his lips
like he wanted to talk.
I was right over him,
and he was staring up at me,
and he kept...
opening his mouth.
I don't know, maybe he didn't see me there.
I don't know.
If I start making sense, will you tell me?
You're making sense.
Thank you.
And he... reached up. He could still move his hand,
and he grabbed mine.
I asked him if he was all right,
and he just kept holding my hand,
kept squeezing it,
while we were waiting for the paramedics to arrive.
It's really pretty awful, isn't it?
Yes.
Maria said that he was angry during the plea bargaining session,
that he stepped out to make a phone call.
Uh, yes.
Uh, some guy he needed to find.
Some guy?
Damian... something.
He, uh, he stole some clients.
I'd offer you a chair, I really would, but...
No, no, I'm fine.
You want food? There's food.
No, I'm-I'm good.
Will called me at 11:30,
just before your bargaining session.
Do you know why?
No.
He didn't say anything?
No.
I had some pictures on my phone.
My wife, my son.
He asked me about them.
What did he ask?
Their names.
You should get to bed.
I really should, shouldn't I?
Could you tell the nurse?
Yes.
Thank you, Finn.
I wanted to tell you something.
What?
I'm sorry.
I really am.
Are you all right?
I don't know.
I'm really sorry about Will.
I know.
Alicia, I'm sorry.
I want what we had.
I want to be with you... and only you.
Forever.
Call me back, please.
