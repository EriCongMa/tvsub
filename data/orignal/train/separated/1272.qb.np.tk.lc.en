i don &apos;t like quinoa . it &apos;s too grainy .
it &apos;s not a grain . it &apos;s a chenopod .
well , i don &apos;t like &quot; keenopads . &quot;
chenopod .
quinoa is closely related to beets , spinach , and tumbleweed .
tumbleweed ?
yes , put that at the top of my &quot; do not serve &quot; list , too .
are you having second thoughts ?
well , i can &apos;t back out now .
i mean , dr. nolan asked us
to do this presentation six months ago .
and , yes , i do not enjoy thinking about hoyt .
i mean , serial killers go after complete strangers .
how &apos;d i manage to get the one who wanted to get personal ?
well , you presented a unique challenge
to someone like charles hoyt .
so you &apos;re saying it &apos;s a compliment
that he tried to kill me ?
i suppose .
let &apos;s go over the presentation again .
okay .
all right , two setups at the blood cottage .
the first is the west roxbury mansion ,
where we found martin yeager &apos;s body .
his wife , gail , was missing ,
but we found evidence of a second body
and eventually discovered gail &apos;s body in a remote area .
what &apos;s the matter ?
just remembering the motile sperm i found on her body .
yeah , right ?
it &apos;s not bad enough that he &apos;s a serial killer .
no , no . can be a necrophiliac , too .
yay .
three @-@ day symposium
where we can re @-@ live our four @-@ year nightmare .
only dr. nolan could convince me to do something like this .
did you finish it ?
yes , i made myself , but i thought
she did a really good job with the forensics .
yeah , i did , too .
she sold 100,000 copies so far .
america loves a serial killer .
oh , can you get it ?
yeah .
dr. nolan . hi .
thank you . please come in .
so nice to see you both .
welcome .
this is my research assistant , jack roberts ,
and my publicist , tim felding .
so nice to meet you , detective , doctor .
i &apos;ve heard so much about you both .
we &apos;ve been together for six months on my book tour .
tim humors me by listening to my stories .
hardly humoring you .
there is a reason that your book &apos;s a best @-@ seller .
well , congratulations on the success .
thank you , but i &apos;ll be glad to get back to my research .
would you like to join us for dinner ?
oh , that &apos;s very nice of you ,
but i need to make some phone calls ,
get ahead of any controversy over tonight &apos;s presentation .
you think the blood cottage will be controversial ?
we have had press ask to cover it .
my worry is it might appear to be
a bit gratuitous to the layperson .
well , let the press know
that it &apos;s a powerful investigative training tool .
what a great way to spin it .
what time should we pick you up ?
uh , we can take you .
thank you .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
great . well , we &apos;ll see you there .
lovely .
my new role as a book author came with an entourage .
well , who doesn &apos;t love an entourage ?
mmm . this is so delicious .
mm . props , even for the quinoa .
thank you .
dr. nolan , what is forensic psychiatry , exactly ?
it &apos;s a branch of medicine that focuses on
the intersection of law and mental health .
and why did you decide to specialize in serial killers ?
mom .
it &apos;s all right . i get asked that a lot .
during my psychiatric residency ,
a 5 @-@ year @-@ old boy was referred to me for treatment .
why ? what happened to him ?
ma .
i want to know .
he &apos;d strangled his puppy .
a 5 @-@ year @-@ old ?
yeah . so , see ? tommy &apos;s not so bad after all .
not funny .
okay .
but what made you decide to focus on these three ?
they were a good sample .
charles hoyt was a brilliant medical student ,
which is unusual .
why ?
well , most serial killers are of average intelligence .
yeah , like these two --
gilbert dean reeder was a trucker .
david james johnson was married with children .
so , he had a family ? isn &apos;t that unusual ?
no , not really .
how could his wife not know ?
well , not every serial killer
is a social misfit or a monster , ma .
unfortunately , they &apos;re so normal ,
they hide in plain sight .
that &apos;s what makes them so hard to stop .
well , we should get going .
why can &apos;t i go with you ?
i told you , it is only for law enforcement .
even i find the blood cottage disturbing .
it looks real , ma .
the crime @-@ scene techs , they set up forensic dummies .
how do they make the dummies look real ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
they bleed synthetic gel . it &apos;s not pretty .
okay . who thinks of this stuff ?
we agree on the definition of a serial killer --
three or more murders -- but what we don &apos;t agree on
are the investigative techniques ,
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
tonight , we begin with detective jane rizzoli
and dr. maura isles .
if you &apos;ve read my book ...
... you know that these two were instrumental
in the capturing of serial killer charles hoyt .
追捕连环杀手
thank you . it &apos;s very nice to be here .
putting a stop to hoyt &apos;s killing spree
became very personal for me .
during the course of my investigation ,
hoyt developed an obsession with me
and tried to kill me more than once .
the truth is , this is difficult to talk about .
i &apos;m glad that he &apos;s dead ...
because he can &apos;t hurt anyone else , ever .
but i will never stop wondering why .
we know about 70 % of serial killers
were abused as children , and 60 % have brain damage .
but we also know that every society has them .
so tonight , we focus not on why but on how --
how we investigate .
what you &apos;re about to see is a staged crime scene .
it &apos;s what we call a blood cottage .
we will show you how we analyzed the forensic details
of the murder of martin yeager and his wife , gail .
when we arrived at the crime scene that you &apos;re about to see ,
martin yeager was duct @-@ taped and slaughtered ,
and his wife , gail , was missing .
um , this teacup was one of hoyt &apos;s signatures .
he , uh , would place it on the man &apos;s knee
and -- and use it as a warning device .
does he look a little too real to you ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i don &apos;t know .
excuse us just for a second , please .
he looks real because he is real .
whoever did it wanted to get to us
- wanted to get to all of us .
it worked .
jenkins .
what do you need , detective ?
keep everybody at least 10 feet away from the stage , okay ?
it &apos;s a crime scene , even if they are cops .
you got it .
thanks .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
what did you get from campus security ?
well , they said it &apos;s an all @-@ cop symposium ,
so there was no need for additional security .
they got that wrong .
yeah .
what about access ?
auditorium is always open .
all right , tell the uniforms not to let anybody leave .
these guys are all cops , jane .
well , they &apos;re all suspects now .
all right .
you were right ...
both bpd crime @-@ scene techs .
found their uniforms and badges backstage .
kent williams . june ferguson ...
i don &apos;t recognize either one of them . do you ?
no .
what &apos;s in the box ?
props they brought to dress the crime scenes .
all right , we &apos;re gonna need
all of the campus security footage , okay ?
made the calls . it &apos;s already coming in .
what do you make of this ?
everybody here had experience with serial killers .
this is like some taunt --
like , &quot; i can do this , and you can &apos;t stop me . &quot;
smacks of hoyt , doesn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m not sure .
but what about the teacup , jane ?
it &apos;s the same pattern as the yeagers &apos; crime scene .
is there a teacup in the prop box ?
yeah .
okay . that means the killer brought his own .
there are 100,000 copies of dr. nolan &apos;s book out there .
is there a photo of the teacup in the book ?
right there .
yeah , you can just make out the pattern .
so whoever has this book could &apos;ve re @-@ created this .
yeah , it may not be connected to hoyt at all .
so we &apos;re looking at , what --
8,000 bcu students , 950 faculty and employees ?
and all those cops .
can you estimate the time of death ?
i measured their core temperatures .
they were both at 35 degrees celsius .
they died about two hours ago .
let me show you something over here .
looks like a burn .
hoyt used a stun gun . that &apos;s not from a stun gun .
i found an identical mark on our male victim &apos;s arm .
is that a burn or a branding ?
jane .
um , go talk to her . maybe she can help .
what should i do ?
the detectives think
that we should keep the symposium going .
why ?
the suspect might be here .
you think he might be part of the law @-@ enforcement community ?
i &apos;m wondering how i should respond to the press .
you should let the public information officer
handle it right now .
i have seen so many grisly photos
and videos of crime scenes , but i &apos;ve never actually seen ...
dr. nolan , are you all right ?
doctor , take a seat .
no , no , i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m fine . i just ...
you want some water ?
no , no , no .
i @-@ i @-@ i knew them , the crime @-@ scene techs ,
june and kent .
i asked them to do this . i feel responsible .
no , you are not responsible .
i can &apos;t believe that we were enjoying dinner
while this was happening .
dr. nolan , i know this hard ,
but we are going to need your help .
organized , controlled ,
chose random victims , fearless .
because he took out two police @-@ department employees
at a symposium for serial killers .
although until there &apos;s a third murder ,
technically , he &apos;s not a serial killer .
the theatrical staging indicates he wants to play .
with us .
which means this will escalate .
you think there &apos;ll be more ?
i do , yeah .
the burns are significant .
none of hoyt &apos;s apprentices ever added their own signatures .
trace evidence is doing a complete work @-@ up on the bodies .
i won &apos;t be able to do the autopsies till tomorrow ,
but i &apos;ll be able to tell you more about the burns then .
uh , we can wait downstairs if you &apos;re not finished .
is it all right if i head back to the hotel ?
of course , yes . thank you so much for your help .
we went through all the security footage .
there are no cameras monitoring the auditorium .
we &apos;re trying to track every person
who was on campus at the time of the murders .
that &apos;ll be thousands .
yeah .
i matched credentials for all law @-@ enforcement
against their registration for the symposium .
everyone &apos;s who they said they were .
it &apos;s 2 : 00 a.m. let &apos;s go home .
all right .
you can stay with me tonight .
no . i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s not him , maura .
i know , but it &apos;s still stressful .
i want to go home , take a bath , and pet my dog .
i got to check on kojak . she had puppies .
kojak had a sex change ?
can we meet back here in six hours ?
hey , jo .
you &apos;d be barking like crazy if somebody was in here , right ?
you can &apos;t wag your tail
and make friends if it &apos;s a bad guy , okay ?
okay , jo . i &apos;m overreacting , right ?
come here , sweetie .
on days like today , i think i &apos;d like to be you .
hello , jane .
i &apos;m sorry to have to wake you .
you looking for this ?
come in .
i wanted you to meet theo .
did i ever tell you how i learned to kill ?
my first pup was named rascal .
you remember what we talked about , right ?
i still remember that first time ,
when i could feel rascal &apos;s pulse as the blood was pumping .
you know what i did , jane , right ?
you can &apos;t ... no .
no !
hey , jo . jo , come here .
sorry , sweetie .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
maura , somebody &apos;s at the door .
it &apos;s jane . she just called .
thank you .
hey , ma .
i just had the worst nightmare .
what was it about ?
rather not say .
okay . sit . you want some eggs ?
no , just -- just coffee , please .
okay .
thanks , ma .
okay . i want to know if i have ptsd .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not an expert .
but you &apos;ve thought it .
anybody who &apos;s gone through
the trauma you &apos;ve gone through with hoyt
would likely suffer from post @-@ traumatic stress .
i just thought these nightmares would have stopped by now .
at least 75 % of people suffering from post @-@ traumatic stress
do have nightmares .
so i have it ?
no , i didn &apos;t say that .
can you just forget about it ?
well , actually , no .
no , don &apos;t forget about it .
there is something called imagery rehearsal therapy .
you replay the dream , jane , but you change the way it ends .
okay . i can do that .
it &apos;s just so real .
it was like it meant some-- do you think it meant something ?
the science behind dreams isn &apos;t well @-@ established .
maura , i just want your opinion .
it doesn &apos;t have to be peer @-@ reviewed .
themes and patterns in dreams may be telling you something
your frontal cortices ignore when you &apos;re awake .
take a sick day .
have sergeant korsak and detective frost handle it .
please , baby , stop .
come on . look at you .
you know i can &apos;t do that , ma .
trace evidence didn &apos;t find anything
on the duct tape , the clothing , or the body .
that &apos;s too bad .
you see the pattern in the burn ?
yeah .
well , there &apos;s a similar pattern in the male victim &apos;s burn .
so you think the killer used the same object to brand them ?
possibly . i &apos;m taking an impression of both burns .
i &apos;ll have frost run a description of
both burns through the vicap database .
but i &apos;m not holding out hope .
we &apos;re gonna get a hit
on anyone that &apos;s ever been burned with a cigarette .
anything ?
not yet . it &apos;s still drying .
hoping to get a negative of a negative .
a who ?
well , a burn is a negative impression ,
so a latex is a --
negative @-@ negative . got it .
okay , skip to the part
where you tell me what it was that burned them .
you know , i think it &apos;s healthy
that you &apos;ve begun to process your trauma .
i knew i opened a can of ptsd worms today .
can we just not talk about it , please ?
no , your reaction is normal .
okay . have you talked to dr. nolan today ?
yes . she thinks that we should have
all of the symposium &apos;s participants
do a personality test .
all cops have taken it . i &apos;ve taken it .
yeah . me too .
it &apos;s a requirement to get your license renewed .
and if the killer is law enforcement ,
he &apos;d have taken it ,
which means he &apos;ll know what we &apos;re trying to do
and try to beat the test .
yes . but i plan on comparing our results
to the ones on file .
oh , good idea .
neither impression is very clear .
so , four negatives .
bummer .
csru didn &apos;t find anything at the crime scene .
nothing ? no hair , no fingerprints ?
no saliva , no blood , not a damn thing .
not even a footprint .
no one is this good the first time out .
stupid friggin &apos; way to try to solve a double homicide .
how many have you collected ?
59 . but everyone on the list signed in .
we should get all 120 .
and you &apos;ve been confirming identification ?
yes . they &apos;ve been showing me photo i.d.s.
i &apos;ve got better things to do .
you &apos;d think they do , too .
if anyone gives you a hard time , let me know .
oh , i can handle these guys .
why would the killer re @-@ create the yeager murders ?
that question kept me up all night .
there are different categories of serial killers .
this one seems to fall into
either thrill killer or power @-@ seeker killer .
if i fail your test ,
am i a thrill man or a power man ?
thank you , detective fletcher .
you know , in pittsburgh , we wouldn &apos;t be farting around
giving personality tests to cops .
we &apos;d have them help ,
probably even have an arrest by now .
thank you for your input .
any time .
take my card .
you call me when you &apos;re ready to solve this .
grandiosity is the hallmark of psychopathy .
i can &apos;t wait to score detective fletcher &apos;s test .
we &apos;ve identified these three --
detective mike clemens , from omaha ,
detective reggie jones , from new york ,
and this one -- detective chuck fletcher , from pittsburgh .
all show the signs of evasiveness ,
inconclusive responses , and defensiveness .
they tried to beat the test ?
we think so .
we compared our tests
to tests their departments had on file .
so trying to beat it got them caught .
we noted high scores for ego and hostility
in all three of these ,
along with an absence of empathy .
they &apos;re psychopaths .
or sociopaths .
i &apos;d need to do some more testing .
it &apos;s enough to round them up and interview them .
did detective frost get anything on the vicap search
when he ran the burns ?
over a thousand hits .
not much help .
jane okay ?
yeah . are you ?
yeah .
you know all our stories .
you &apos;ve probably read my statements .
yes , i did .
this must be very difficult for you , too .
you once rescued detective rizzoli
from charles hoyt .
i did .
worst night of my life .
wish i &apos;d killed the son of a bitch .
okay , thanks .
clemens and jones are in a seminar at the symposium .
chuck fletcher didn &apos;t sign in .
you look at fletcher &apos;s file ?
yeah , got it right here .
he &apos;s a 15 @-@ year veteran
with a lot of black marks on his record .
45 complaints for use of excessive force ?
that &apos;s a lot .
got passed over for a promotion recently .
disciplined for drinking on the job ...
serial killers are often substance abusers .
we got to find chuck fletcher .
sergeant korsak .
okay , we &apos;re on it .
get jane .
they found a body at the bcu campus .
is that dumpster emptied on a regular schedule ?
i &apos;ll find out . why ?
i &apos;m just thinking whoever dumped that body
was looking for maximum impact .
killer knew once that dumpster was moved ,
everybody &apos;s gonna get a good show .
dead guy &apos;s a cop .
what ?
guess we can rule out chuck fletcher .
you &apos;re right , jane .
dumpster gets emptied at 10 : 05,
right as classes let out .
all right , come on . let &apos;s take a look at the body .
stabbed .
one wound under the solar plexus .
and look at his wrist .
that &apos;s the same burn .
so somebody lured him here .
that &apos;s why his gun &apos;s still in the holster .
yeah . either he knew his killer or he wasn &apos;t afraid of him .
both ears were severed , and the damage to his eyes
appears to have been inflicted post @-@ mortem .
see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil .
oh , god .
what is it ?
the second killer that dr. nolan profiled --
that &apos;s what he did to his victims .
you think the serial killer
is working his way through my book ?
i don &apos;t know .
but this could be directed at me ?
i &apos;m not a detective ...
i don &apos;t have any family , and no one has threatened me .
all three of our victims
had ties to law enforcement and the symposium .
but what do you make of the copycat aspect ?
serial killers like to play out their own individual fantasies .
exactly .
so why play out someone else &apos;s fantasy ?
with the exception of the burn ,
our killer is just re @-@ creating murders .
perhaps he &apos;s saying , &quot; you solved this the first time ,
but you won &apos;t solve it a second time . &quot;
he &apos;s certainly giving us a challenge .
the third killer in your book is david james johnson .
could that be next ?
he looks like the perfect family man .
doesn &apos;t he ?
he used to chain his victims to a wall .
drive knives , nails , or scalpels through their hands and feet ,
usually while they were still alive .
4 % of the population is either a sociopath or a psychopath .
well , luckily , they &apos;re not all serial killers .
and i do think law enforcement serves as a deterrent .
unlikely .
serial killers are impulsive by nature ,
fearless of consequences .
jane , it &apos;s me !
why are you yelling ? !
i didn &apos;t want to scare you .
what are you doing here ?
spending the night .
what -- no , frankie .
i don &apos;t remember inviting you .
some whack @-@ job has taken out three cops in the last 24 hours .
i &apos;m not sleeping alone tonight . neither are you .
well , i &apos;m not sleeping with you .
come on .
if something happened to you , i couldn &apos;t forgive myself .
nothing &apos;s gonna happen to me .
please , get yourself a beer .
thanks . i got one .
jane , it &apos;s just me !
i got some food .
hi , ma .
hi . hey , frankie .
hey , ma .
so , let me guess --
you &apos;re here to make sure the boogeyman doesn &apos;t get me ?
yes . that &apos;s what mothers are for .
so , who wants some lasagna ?
but we could start with some chocolate .
you always get it first !
i want the hearts .
frankie -- fine . i will give you the hearts .
i &apos;m taking an impression of his burn .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s a better negative @-@ negative this time .
let &apos;s not anticipate results , but i think it might be .
i see something .
looks like snakes on a stick .
are those wings ?
i think it could be the rod of asclepius ,
which often gets confused with the caduceus .
who would get confused ?
the caduceus is two snakes
entwined around the magic wand of hermes , topped by wings .
right . who doesn &apos;t know that ?
you &apos;d be surprised .
and asclepius was an ancient greek physician ,
and that symbol is one snake , encircling a staff .
the medical symbol ?
yes .
maura ...
do you think june and kent were burned by the same thing
that made this mark on chuck fletcher ?
i think they were all burned by an object
that is approximately 1.9 by 1.5 centimeters .
that &apos;s his signature .
let &apos;s run it through vicap .
six hits with burns
that sort of look like the ones on our victims .
maura , was the same object used to brand them ?
the burns look similar , but the images just aren &apos;t good .
i can &apos;t be sure .
first murder was in 1988 .
there wasn &apos;t another murder with that burn until 1999 .
why stop for 11 years ?
killer could &apos;ve been incarcerated .
many serial killers stop for long periods .
frost , can you pull up the case file on the first murder ?
it &apos;s a double murder --
a prominent cleveland pediatrician and his wife .
dr. sheppard appleton and his wife , susan ,
女儿幸存
were shot to death in a home invasion .
and their daughter survived by hiding in a closet .
so the first victims weren &apos;t law enforcement .
what about the other four murders ?
no ties to cops . all random people .
what else do we know about that double murder ?
doctor was shot twice in the chest while watching tv .
wife was hit in the abdomen ,
crawled , shot another five times at point @-@ blank range .
can you say &quot; overkill &quot; ?
so these may or may not be related .
if they are related ,
then our killer went from guns
to copycat serial murders .
well , it &apos;s not unheard of in the research
for a serial killer to change his m.o.
jane , what if none of these six unsolved murders
have anything to do with our three ?
then we &apos;re back to square one .
you sure you don &apos;t want soemthing ?
i know it &apos;s a police station , but the food is good .
no , i &apos;m good . thanks .
i had jack burn dvds of all my interviews .
thank you , jack .
i &apos;ll meet you outside .
i hope it helps .
i can &apos;t imagine how ,
but you &apos;re welcome to go through them .
did any of these three men
ever mention communicating with anyone on the outside ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but i do know that they all got fan mail .
explain that one to me . you got any copies of those ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m a simple guy . i don &apos;t care why .
just want to stop them .
i had a thought about how detective fletcher
might have been lured behind that dumpster .
really ?
well , i want to confirm it first .
but i can take a look at the area
on my way to the next seminar at 4 : 00 .
i &apos;d like to go there with you .
dog alarm . got a new litter of pups .
mom won &apos;t leave them .
luckily , i live close by . i could meet you there .
well , why don &apos;t i send jack ahead
to get my powerpoint presetation ready ?
and we could swing by your place
and then take a look at the dumpster .
i don &apos;t want to slow you down .
my dog died right before my book tour .
it would be so good to just pet an animal today .
well , come on , then .
hey , frankie , can you take these dvds upstairs ?
sure .
you on puppy watch ?
yeah .
any instructions ?
jane and frost know what to look for .
so , what we &apos;re looking for
is any mention of someone on the outside .
okay .
oh , jane , let me listen to the hoyt interviews .
that &apos;s okay . i got it .
so , please talk to me about your family history .
i &apos;d like to know the details
of the first time that you killed a living thing .
so , can we go back for a second
and talk me through that first murder again ?
i &apos;d like to ask you about detective rizzoli .
well , i love to talk about detective rizzoli .
don &apos;t be jealous .
we have a special relationship , too , victoria .
tell me why you like her so much .
i love your neck .
it &apos;s so beautiful .
and your breasts ...
very firm .
tell me , jane -- what would you like to do to me ?
i &apos;d like to get my gun ...
... and put it in your mouth and pull the trigger .
okay ?
guns are so impersonal .
we &apos;re trained doctors , victoria .
so was sheppard .
&quot; sheppard &quot; ?
just think --
think how exquisite it would &apos;ve been to
feel sheppard &apos;s pulse as
the blood drained out .
and susan &apos;s , too , as she crawled ...
hoyt knew about the double murders in cleveland .
what ?
you think hoyt did it ? - no . there --
there &apos;s no way he could have .
he was training at fort stewart .
those murders are the key .
are those all the photos ?
oh . just got one more .
oh , my god .
push in on his left wrist .
you see his cufflink ?
the medical symbol . that has to be it , maura .
it &apos;s the right size ,
and it would make a similar impression .
where &apos;s the other cufflink ?
frost , push in on his right wrist .
it &apos;s not there .
spearmint okay ?
sounds delicious .
oh . who do we have here ?
the dark one is starsky ,
and the little white one is hutch .
they &apos;re rescues .
you &apos;re not married ?
no .
three wives , not one of them ever looked at me
the way my dogs do .
they think i &apos;m the greatest man who ever lived .
always glad to see me , aren &apos;t you , fellas ?
uh @-@ oh . mom &apos;s hungry .
nursing takes a lot of calories . come on .
the daughter , tory ,
was taken to a local hospital and treated for shock .
we should find her and talk to her .
she says in her statement to police she never saw the killer .
well , maybe she did and was too scared to say .
she &apos;d recently given birth .
who ? the wife ?
the 14 @-@ year @-@ old .
that &apos;s what the medical exams revealed .
well , she didn &apos;t mention it to the police .
no . there are no hospital records of her giving birth .
well , her father was a pediatrician .
maybe it was a home birth ?
was she ever treated for broken bones ?
yes .
uh , more than once .
but no reports of abuse ?
no .
check to see if dr. appleton
had privileges at the hospital where tory was treated .
儿科医生 医学博士
he did .
so everyone who cared for his daughter worked for him .
that &apos;s why no one reported the abuse .
i think you might be right , charles .
knives and scalpels might be more satisfying .
perhaps because it was my first time .
i was still conflicted .
you needed some distance , yes .
big risk , giving us that interview .
hardly .
your colleagues won &apos;t be able to
put my complicated puzzle together .
you killed your parents .
and started again 11 years later ?
in medical school ?
yes .
after i read about unsolved murders
that turned out to be the work of charles hoyt .
so organized , controlled , meticulous .
why me ?
you &apos;re a &quot; simple guy . &quot;
you come home every day at 3 : 30 to feed your nursing dog .
i &apos;ll get jack started ,
and i &apos;ll still make it to the symposium by 4 : 00 .
with my alibi and one for jack , too ,
no one will question me .
do you think of yourself as part of the system , sergeant ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re asking me .
have you ever interviewed a teenage girl ?
many times .
and what would you do if that girl --
who is ... 14 , let &apos;s say --
told you that she had been repeatedly raped
by her prominent father ?
i &apos;d arrest him .
liar !
you would hide behind the system .
my mother hid behind her perfect home
and her respectable husband --
dr. appleton , pillar of the community .
do you know how they explained my son to people ?
oh , i already know the story .
please . i like hearing it .
tell me .
they said he &apos;d been abandoned at my father &apos;s office ,
and they put him up for adoption .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
hello .
do you know that you can desensitize a child
by having him practice violent behavior ?
makes sense . is that what you did to jack ?
when i finally found him , yes .
remember when you were 5 ...
and i taught you how to kill a puppy ?
yeah , mom .
i do .
don &apos;t .
we &apos;re not here for the puppy .
we &apos;re here for you .
ok . thank you .
that 14 @-@ year @-@ old girl who witnessed her parents &apos; double murder
went into foster care .
why do you look so ominous ?
because she changed her name
from tory appleton to victoria nolan .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s dr. nolan ?
yeah .
how ? she was with us when the murders occurred .
she has a partner .
68 % of female serial killers kill in teams .
where did you get that from ?
her introduction .
where is she right now ?
uh , she &apos;s gonna be at the symposium in 30 minutes .
korsak &apos;s not back yet ?
yeah , where is he ?
he &apos;s taking his sweet time today .
maybe he &apos;s getting a little more than puppy love .
what do you mean ?
what ? he and dr. nolan went back to his house to feed his dog .
frost .
jack , use the carbon @-@ steel scalpel .
all right .
you trained him well .
haven &apos;t i ?
i let him do the last three on his own .
how many have you done together ?
not enough .
tell him what we have planned .
charles hoyt preferred to go
between the palmar interosseous bones .
like he did with jane .
but david felt it was more painful to split the ulna
and the radius bones .
don &apos;t make your son do this .
i don &apos;t make him do it . he enjoys it .
oh , i do .
i have so many good memories of doing this with my mom .
this isn &apos;t random .
this is personal .
yes , it is .
i hold you responsible for what happened to charles .
a little help down here !
you cut his work short . he had so much left to do .
it &apos;s time .
jack , give me his gun .
charles taught me guns ruin the experience .
how many ?
murders ? oh , it &apos;s crass to count .
we don &apos;t brand them all . it &apos;d make it too easy .
but we &apos;ll brand you .
not yet .
take the scalpel .
yes , i know the sequence .
carbon steel ...
why do you let her tell you what to do ?
she doesn &apos;t tell me what to do .
stop wasting time , jack .
sorry , mom .
and here i thought you were doing this all by yourself .
obviously . you &apos;ve been at the crime scenes .
you &apos;ve seen my work .
no . what i &apos;ve seen is your mother telling you what to do .
his hands , jack , now .
all right !
how old are you ? 25 ?
you let your mother tell you what to do ?
finish it !
yeah , i &apos;d never put up with that .
shut up !
you telling me or you telling her ? !
i said finish it !
shut up !
now look what you made me do !
don &apos;t move , you piece of crap .
call an ambulance .
you okay ?
not for me , for them .
there &apos;s bolt cutters in that tool bag .
yeah , i need e.m.s.
at 6424 dorchester avenue .
oh , let him die .
he &apos;s always reminded me of my father .
make her walk , frost .
come on .
you sure you &apos;re okay ?
yeah .
i am glad to see you , though .
well , i always did want to rescue you .
come on .
oh . pretty cold , huh ?
her telling us to let her son die .
psychopaths are incapable of forming relationships .
poor kid .
that &quot; poor kid &quot; hit you in the head with a 2x4 .
he was gonna drive a scalpel through you .
i &apos;d have shot him through the nuts , if they &apos;d hurt my dogs .
well i really like your porch , sergeant .
it must be nice to have a porch .
yeah , you can check out your neighbors .
got any cute ones ?
yeah . three sisters live next door .
your age or our age ?
go knock . check for yourself .
it &apos;s nice to finally see your home , vince .
it &apos;s nice having you . next time bring some food .
yes ...
we &apos;re rushing over this time .
yeah , ok , that was good thinking .
cheers .
cheers .
