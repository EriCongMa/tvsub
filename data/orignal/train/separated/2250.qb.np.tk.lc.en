the curse--it &apos;s broken ?
appears so .
then why are we still here ?
the dark one summons thee .
what was that ?
in your land , you would call it a wraith .
if it can &apos;t be killed , what do you suggest ?
it will open a portal to our land .
all we have to do is send the wraith in there .
it &apos;s coming !
aah ! no ! no !
mulan , what is that ?
that is what brought the wraith here .
that &apos;s what killed our prince .
this , gentlemen , is our mission ,
the great barrier of our existence .
does it remain ?
we must investigate the line .
i made straws . short one crosses . draw .
with the curse broken , we can cross , right ?
should be no problem . yeah ?
with magic back , it could be even worse now .
like , vaporize us .
let &apos;s go home .
guys !
we are the royal guard !
dwarves loyal to snow white !
this is our chance to prove ourselves to the prince .
we must do this .
show your hands .
you &apos;re up , snotty .
you know , what if we found a turtle
and sort of nudged it over first ?
oh , for the love of ...
sneezy , you okay ?
sneezy !
第二集
my boy .
my poor boy .
if you are looking for a family member , come to the front table .
if you need counseling , dr. hopper has a sign @-@ up sheet .
if the wraith damaged your house ,
there are cots at the school .
this is getting out of hand .
people are in a panic . they don &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;ll be fine .
we just need everyone to remain calm .
i have a feeling our prince is working on something right now .
tell me ... about this .
surprised you don &apos;t have armed guards &apos; round the clock .
don &apos;t need &apos; em .
we both know if you step outside ,
there &apos;s a line a mile long for your head .
who &apos;s going to risk coming at me ?
take your chances then .
but i think that little wallpaper trick
was an anomaly .
if you had your abilities back ,
this town would be charcoal by now .
you &apos;re having problems with magic , aren &apos;t you ?
right now the only thing keeping you alive
is that henry wishes it .
now this .
it &apos;s the hat that pulled your loved ones away .
well , where did you get it ?
i &apos;ve long since forgotten .
you know what ?
maybe you should be less concerned with hats
and more concerned with taking care of my son .
oh , because you took such great care of him .
i will not listen to child care lectures
from a man who put his daughter in a box
and shipped her to maine .
okay . listen . i need my family .
there &apos;s magic here now . there have to be ways to follow them .
follow them where ? into a sucking airless void ?
and good luck getting magic to work ,
because as you said , you &apos;d be charcoal .
ah , frustrated , are we ?
serves you right .
you earned every bit of this .
keep on baiting me , charming .
right now i don &apos;t have magic and i don &apos;t have my son ,
but when i get one , i get the other ,
and you don &apos;t want to be around when that happens .
if you have to use magic to keep your son ,
you don &apos;t really have him .
come on , rocinante ! go !
we &apos;re almost free .
and i thought we were done with all this nonsense .
hello , mother .
what evil have you conjured ?
not evil , darling .
a barrier spell .
designed to keep you where you belong .
i can &apos;t leave ?
not alone . not without the king .
we &apos;ve been through this .
in two days , you &apos;ll be married .
you &apos;ll be queen .
after that , you &apos;re free to go ,
whenever you &apos;re with him .
mama , i don &apos;t want to marry the king .
i don &apos;t want this life .
you &apos;re just frightened of having all that power .
i don &apos;t want power .
i want to be free .
power is freedom .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m here to show you .
henry .
have you seen blue ? mother superior .
no , but everyone is looking for you .
do we know where rump-- mr. gold is ?
wait . does the queen still have power ?
i thought i would find my boy .
are the lists complete ?
he &apos;s gotta be planning something !
hey , let me ask you something . are the nuns still nuns ,
or can they , you know , date ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . blue !
don &apos;t say it &apos;s me asking .
could there be a tree on this side ?
the way we sent emma through as a baby--
maybe i could go after &apos; em that way .
it &apos;s possible , but without fairy dust to guide us here , uh ,
no , it &apos;s hopeless .
you &apos;ll find another way .
in the book , things always look worse
right before there &apos;s good news .
terrible news !
terrible news !
we were out at the town limits .
tell &apos; em who you think you are , sneezy !
will you stop calling me that ? you know who i am .
i &apos;m tom clark . i own the dark star pharmacy .
what &apos;s going on here ?
if you cross the border , you lose your memory all over again .
and coming back doesn &apos;t fix it ?
if it did , would i have come running in yelling &quot; terrible news &quot; ? !
if we leave , our cursed selves become our only selves .
do we know that anything &apos;s gotten out that way ?
i wonder if mom knows .
we need help .
i can help !
don &apos;t leave us here !
people ! everybody !
everybody , meet back here in two hours .
i &apos;ll tell you my plan to fix everything .
what &apos;s the plan ?
i don &apos;t know , but i got two hours to figure it out .
come on .
light , damn you .
regina .
i thought you might want to talk .
oh , right , the conscience thing .
it &apos;s what i do .
i &apos;m in no mood .
it &apos;s too bad , &apos; cause ...
&apos;cause i think talking about your pain might be very helpful .
might help you learn who you truly are .
i know who i am .
what do you think , snow ?
it looks beautiful .
no , dear , you look beautiful .
what &apos;s this ?
what ?
that &apos;s mine .
it &apos;s pretty .
where did you get it ?
daniel gave it to me .
the stable boy .
the one who left you .
he didn &apos;t leave me .
what ?
he was killed .
oh , no .
he was killed because you couldn &apos;t keep a secret from my mother .
but ...
but she said ...
she told me she was going to help you .
my mother corrupts young souls .
if you were stronger , none of this would &apos;ve happened .
it &apos;s pretty .
where did you get it ?
i don &apos;t remember .
daddy , you don &apos;t know what mother &apos;s doing to me .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s turning me into her .
i have to get away .
get away ? but tomorrow &apos;s the wedding , child .
i don &apos;t want to marry the king .
i &apos;ve told you that .
are you certain it isn &apos;t just cold feet ?
daddy , this is not cold feet .
this-- this is--
this is insanity .
i &apos;m angry all the time .
she &apos;s making me crazy .
she wants to give you everything she never got for herself .
i don &apos;t want her life .
i want a life of my own .
how did she get like this ?
there was a man .
well , not quite a man .
someone cora knew before i met her .
he brought magic to her .
gave her that book of spells .
he made her like she is .
what was his name ?
i don &apos;t know .
cora won &apos;t even say it .
but the book is his .
the library &apos;s beneath the clock tower .
you closed it , remember ?
when you still had power .
i need the book .
i need to get my son back .
which book ?
so it &apos;s come down to that , eh ?
you need your mommy &apos;s help .
give me the book .
do you really need the smell of the written word
to get the magic flowing again , love ?
maybe if you relaxed , it would just happen .
i don &apos;t have time .
it worked once . i know i can do it . just--
i just need a shortcut back .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t have time either .
leave .
please .
well ...
how about that ?
your &quot; pleases &quot; have lost their punch .
well , the fact remains
jump @-@ starting your magic is not in my best interests .
you know what else isn &apos;t in your best interest ?
having everyone know the enchanted forest still exists .
knowing that you and i are keeping that little secret .
you &apos;re up to something ...
and it doesn &apos;t involve going back home .
careful , dearie .
these are straight @-@ up spells .
rough on the system .
i don &apos;t care if they turn me green .
i &apos;m getting my son back .
oh , my .
what ?
it &apos;s just holding that--
i told you once you didn &apos;t look like her , but now ...
now i can see it .
rumplesh ...
stilts ...
rumpleschtiltskin , i summon thee .
that &apos;s not how you say it , dearie ,
but then ...
you didn &apos;t have to say anything .
what are you ?
what ? what ? what ? my , my , what a rude question .
i am not a what .
sorry . i don &apos;t really know what i &apos;m doing .
that much is clear .
allow me to introduce myself .
rumplestiltskin .
and i &apos;m--
regina . i know .
you do ?
but of course .
because of my mother cora .
you taught her ?
my legend precedes me .
people say i look like her when she was younger .
really ?
i don &apos;t see it .
no , that &apos;s not how i know you .
oh . how then ?
i knew you long ago , dearie .
it &apos;s been some time ,
but i knew this day would come .
i &apos;ve been waiting for it .
and i &apos;m so happy
we &apos;re back where we belong .
where &apos;s that ?
together .
people of storybrooke ,
i know we &apos;re trapped again and things look ... bleak ...
but ... they &apos;re not .
no . keep going . you were on to something .
no , i wasn &apos;t .
i did the fighting . snow did the talking .
can i see that ?
yeah .
i think i know what this is .
it &apos;s the mad hatter &apos;s hat .
it &apos;s a portal between worlds .
mad hatter .
you &apos;ve heard of him ?
no . i mean , yeah . i mean , the prince @-@ me doesn &apos;t know him ,
but david had memories of reading &quot; alice in wonderland &quot; in school .
i need to get it to work again .
who is he ? i mean , who is he here ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe he &apos;ll check in at the crisis center .
you could check after the thing .
what thing ?
the meeting where you tell us all your plan ?
remember the speech you were doing ?
right .
i &apos;ll be back for that .
gramps , you gotta use me . come on !
the curse was broken &apos; cause of me !
let me help !
or not .
it appears when i bought that &quot; closed &quot; sign ,
i was just throwing my money away .
looks like it .
sorry to hear about your wife and daughter .
if you &apos;re looking for a retrieval ,
i &apos;m afraid portal @-@ jumping is just outside my purview .
of course it is .
so what &apos;s the commotion outside ?
a little stir at the border . a problem crossing the line .
do tell .
actually , i &apos;m here to buy something--
a way to find someone .
what , like a map ?
something with a bit more kick ,
like the ring you gave me to find snow .
oh , yeah . magic .
whom are you following ?
not telling .
so do you have something of theirs , this missing person ?
yes .
may i see it ?
no .
pour this on the object and then follow it .
so simple , even david nolan could do it .
what do you want ?
peace .
leave me alone .
what do you care what david nolan does ?
no . no . it &apos;s-- it &apos;s charming i worry about .
i &apos;d like a little ... non @-@ interference guarantee .
fine . if you give me the same .
you and i--we stay out of each other &apos;s way .
thank you for your business .
so , uh , what happens
when you try and cross the border ?
you lose your memory of everything of our old lives .
looks like we &apos;re stuck here .
oh , yes , i know everything about you , my dear .
i held you in my arms .
you were younger , more ...
portable .
there is much history between your family and me--
history both in the past and in the future .
then can you help me ?
possibly , yes .
you seek power ?
the death of your enemies ?
the death of your friends ?
no .
i don &apos;t want to hurt anyone .
hard to believe you &apos;re from the same family .
so kind ,
so gentle ...
so ...
powerful .
you could do so much
if you just let yourself .
but i don &apos;t know how .
well ...
let me show you the way .
how did--
magic .
it can set you free .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
use magic-- that &apos;s what she does .
i don &apos;t want to end up like her .
no . no . of course not ,
but that &apos;s the beauty of my gift .
you don &apos;t have to .
it will do it for you .
what is it ?
a portal .
a passage between lands .
this is a portal to a specific annoying little world .
useless to me ,
but for your purposes , a @-@ perfect .
you &apos;re unlikely ever to see her again .
all she needs is a little push .
the question is ... can ... you ... do it ?
oh , thank you .
no one heard me .
you okay ?
good . that means we can talk .
come on , gramps . pick up .
come on . come on .
please , everyone , just be patient .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s gonna be here any second .
granny , do you really need that ?
we got a lawless town , ruby .
damn right i need it .
try calling him again .
he &apos;s not picking up .
just keep trying .
my ...
what a nice turnout .
no need for a fuss .
it &apos;s just little old me .
regina , think about what you &apos;re doing .
bug .
how sweet .
what do you want ? !
me .
she wants me .
okay , i &apos;ll come with you .
just ... leave them alone .
that &apos;s my boy .
can you get me through ?
no .
can you get them back ?
can you get it to work ?
if you only knew .
okay , you had a little girl &apos;s tea set in your car
and a stuffed rabbit toy ,
so i &apos;m thinking you have a daughter you love .
well , i do , too , and a wife ,
and they &apos;re out there somewhere ,
in the enchanted forest or a void .
i don &apos;t even know , but i &apos;m going to get them back .
they &apos;re in the enchanted forest . that &apos;s for sure .
i just can &apos;t get there .
it still exists ?
it exists . i don &apos;t know if that matters since we can &apos;t go there .
so you won &apos;t help me ?
i &apos;m a portal jumper , and you destroyed my portal .
so you &apos;re out of luck .
well , i &apos;m the closest thing left to a sheriff here ,
so i could just throw you in a cell
until you figure out a way .
then all we &apos;ll do is both sit ,
stuck ...
two lives in our heads , cursed worse than ever .
two lives forever at odds .
double the pain .
double the suffering .
david , stop !
get out of my way !
regina has henry !
but he has the way !
she has henry . she &apos;s threatening everyone .
she has henry ?
she showed up at your town meeting--the one you missed .
her magic &apos;s back . everyone &apos;s panicking .
they want to leave town . they &apos;re going to lose everything .
okay . okay , but i have to go after him first .
he &apos;s my only hope of finding a way to get emma and snow back .
back to what ?
this town is about to come apart .
you &apos;ve gotta do something .
now i don &apos;t want you to think
that things are just going to go back to how they used to be .
henry .
don &apos;t fight it , honey .
you &apos;ll get a splinter .
how long am i in prison ?
until i grow up ?
henry , i rescued you because i love you .
so i &apos;m a prisoner because you love me .
that &apos;s not fair .
you know where i come from . that was really not fair .
of all the places i &apos;ve seen , this is the fairest of them all .
you ruined lives .
you sent away mary margaret and emma .
that was an accident .
the way you treated me wasn &apos;t an accident .
you made it so no one believed me .
you made me feel like i was crazy .
but that &apos;s all gonna change now .
henry , you can know all the secrets .
you can live in a house with magic .
look what i could do .
and i can teach you .
you can do this and so much more .
you can have all the friends you want come over any time ,
and you can show them everything in your book .
no one &apos;s gonna want to come over here .
they &apos;re scared of you .
you can make them not be scared .
you can make them love you .
i don &apos;t want that .
i don &apos;t want to be you .
what &apos;s this ?
i don &apos;t know . a gift ?
maybe it &apos;s a portrait .
oh , a looking glass .
not nearly as personal .
i wonder sometimes if the people really love you .
i &apos;m doing my best , mother .
oh , honey , i &apos;m sorry .
come here .
look at you , with your whole life ahead of you ,
and it &apos;s going to be better than you can imagine .
the king &apos;s not a strong man .
the kingdom will be yours .
raise the tributes , form a personal guard ,
let everyone know where the new power lies ,
and you &apos;ll hold the hearts of your people in your hands .
is that what you would do , mother ?
that &apos;s exactly what i would do .
well , the thing is i don &apos;t want to be you .
what are you doing ?
you think it &apos;s that easy to get rid of me ?
you &apos;re stuck with me forever , darling ,
because i &apos;m your mother ,
and i know best .
get out of the way ! we have a right to go !
listen to me !
listen !
if you cross that line , you &apos;re gonna be lost .
everyone who loves you will lose you .
but there &apos;s something worse .
you &apos;ll lose yourself .
look , i get wanting to leave here . i do .
and i get that it &apos;s easier to let go of bad memories ,
but ... even bad memories are part of us .
david , storybrooke david was-- is ...
weak ...
confused ...
and he hurt the woman i love .
i wouldn &apos;t give up being charming just to be him .
but you know what ?
i wouldn &apos;t make the other trade either .
because that david reminds me not only of whom i lost ...
but of who i want to be ,
my weaknesses and my strengths .
david and the prince .
i am both ...
just like you .
you are both .
the town is both .
we are both .
stay here , and every choice is open to you .
live in the woods if you want .
hell , live in a shoe if you want .
or eat frozen burritos and write software .
let &apos;s open granny &apos;s and the school
and get back to work .
i will protect you .
she won &apos;t be able to hurt any of us ,
not as long as i &apos;m alive .
not as long as we all come together ...
as we did before ...
as we shall do again .
leaving , are we ?
that was always the plan .
here . a gift .
i don &apos;t want it .
uh , can &apos;t be a gift . it was mine to start with .
before you go ...
answer me this ...
how did it feel ?
i love my mother .
that &apos;s not what i asked , dearie .
how did it feel
to use magic ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll never use it again .
why not ?
because i loved it .
you &apos;ve discovered who you are .
you could do so much now ...
if you let me show you how .
through magic .
through many things .
and what do you get out of it ?
someday ...
you &apos;ll do something for me .
let me guide you .
and i won &apos;t become like her ?
that , dearie ...
is entirely up ... to you .
i want to see him .
henry , come down .
you won &apos;t be using your sword .
whatever you conjure , i can fight .
i mean , you won &apos;t need your sword .
henry , you &apos;re gonna go home with david .
really ?
really .
i shouldn &apos;t have brought you here .
i was ...
i don &apos;t know how to love very well .
i wasn &apos;t capable of it for a very long time .
but i know-- i remember ...
that if you hold on to someone too hard ,
that doesn &apos;t make them love you .
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you ,
that i made you feel like i didn &apos;t know who you are .
but i want you to be here because you want to be here ,
not because i forced you ...
and not because of magic .
i want to redeem myself .
go get your things .
then prove it .
how ?
answer one question .
does it exist ?
what ?
the enchanted forest , our land--
does it still exist ?
yes .
but i have no idea how to get back there .
i can see i just launched you on a heroic quest .
just also make sure you take care of my son .
that i can do .

don &apos;t worry , brother . you &apos;ve lost something .
it &apos;s gonna take fairy dust to get it back .

come on , boys . it &apos;s off to work we go .
it exists , henry .
the enchanted forest is still out there .
and ... so are they .
yeah .
