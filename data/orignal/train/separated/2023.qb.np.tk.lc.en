i got up early , so i could figure out
if there &apos;s anything around here that i could stand living with .
you want to move in together ?
if the offer still stands .
are you kidding me ?
you slept with quentin while he was married to me .
i asked you back then
if anything had started before we were separated .
you said it hadn &apos;t .
&apos;cause i didn &apos;t want to hurt you .
here &apos;s to your new partnership .
i fronted your buy @-@ in .
how could you do that ?
i did it as a romantic gesture .
yeah , well , pretty woman may have been a romantic movie ,
but julia roberts was still a hooker .
how long have you known quentin had a.l.s. ?
from the beginning .
and how long have you known quentin falsified
trial results to get the drug on the market ?
he didn &apos;t lie .
but you did .
i love him . so what else could i do ?
i am in this , scottie .
okay .
so am i.
i think mike ross went to a subpar law school
and has been lying about it the whole time .
just call up harvard and ask for a copy of his transcript .
professor gerard &apos;s legal ethics class ,
did you ever hear of anybody ever getting an a @-@ plus ?
no , he &apos;s famous for never giving higher than an &quot; a. &quot;
well , what are you so happy about ?
i made bubble @-@ wrap slippers this morning while you were in the shower .
i specifically told you the bubble wrap is for the dishes .
i also made a hat .
okay , i &apos;m moving in with a ten @-@ year @-@ old .
and you love me .
i do .
hey , i was thinking ,
what are we going to do about our bed ?
we already have two .
i know , but , yeah , we do .
but don &apos;t you think a new beginning deserves a new bed ?
that ... is incredibly sweet .
yeah , not bad for a ten @-@ year @-@ old , huh ?
what kind of bed were you thinking ?
whichever one we pick out after we test them tonight .
and did you have any particular test in mind ?
well , now i do .
see , i don &apos;t think the store is gonna let us run that kind of test .
yeah . no , you &apos;re right .
we should probably just test ours before we go out tonight .
what are you doing ?
i think that louis might have just seen us .
come on , what &apos;s the difference ?
we &apos;re moving in together .
i think it &apos;s time we stopped keeping it a secret .
but keeping it a secret is sort of fun .
and sexy .
and i am pro sexy @-@ i mean , i did make
those bubble @-@ wrap slippers and hat after all ,
which is funny , &apos; cause ...
that &apos;s not sexy , it &apos;s just fun .
it &apos;s something .
something .
i made you some too .
hey , harvey , she won &apos;t be back for another week ,
so i don &apos;t think you need to start drinking just yet .
you want to make fun , or you want to help me
figure out where to put this ?
a bottle of scotch ?
you couldn &apos;t get her anything more personal ?
she likes scotch .
you like scotch .
she likes me . therefore ...
why don &apos;t you just attach a card that says ,
&quot; welcome , generic senior partner &quot; ?
this is a $ 12,000 bottle of scotch ,
and this is one of three left in the world .
that doesn &apos;t say generic , that says--
you &apos;re one of three very expensive things
i recently purchased .
we worked it out about the buy @-@ in .
and this is gonna un @-@ work it out .
you know , it &apos;s funny .
first it was too generic . now it &apos;s special .
what are you saying ?
i don &apos;t think you have a problem with my choice of gift .
i think you have a problem with my choice of recipient .
do you think scottie would even be here if it wasn &apos;t for me ?
no , i don &apos;t .
harvey , i want this for you .
i want it to work , and i &apos;m just trying to--
make sure i don &apos;t screw it up .
well , we both know you &apos;re gonna screw it up .
i &apos;m just trying to delay that as long as possible .
you sure about this ?
that bottle is the reason i buy my own present for secretary &apos;s day .
there &apos;s a secretary &apos;s day ?
there is .
and you &apos;re very generous .
how you doing , mike ?
are you excited or what ?
excited about what ?
didn &apos;t you get my email ?
oh , there it is .
why don &apos;t you read it ?
oh , actually , you know what , never mind .
i &apos;ll just let you know what it says .
it &apos;s so great . you &apos;re gonna love it .
it says i invited henry gerard here
to give a lecture this friday .
that &apos;s great .
you don &apos;t even know who he is , do you ?
professor henry gerard ,
author of the definitive text in legal ethics
and chair of the department for the last 20 years .
yeah , i know who he is .
and do you also remember what you got in his class ?
it &apos;s pretty hard to forget an a @-@ plus .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty hard to forget a grade that never happened .
no one gets an a @-@ plus in gerard &apos;s class .
yeah , well , no one can recite an entire chapter of his book from memory .
but i can and did .
bullsh-- .
you never got an a @-@ plus because you never took his class .
it &apos;s a required class , louis . of course i took it .
not if you never went to harvard .
louis , that is insane .
i have a transcript from harvard .
i have a degree from harvard . that &apos;s because i--
wait , let me guess . &apos; cause you went to harvard ?
see , mike , here &apos;s the situation .
i don &apos;t believe you .
and i don &apos;t want to call gerard up and ask him
&apos;cause i don &apos;t want the world laughing at my firm .
but if he doesn &apos;t walk up to you on friday
and say , &quot; mike ross , my beloved student
who i remember , because he &apos;s the only one
i ever gave an a @-@ plus to , &quot;
well , then , i &apos;m gonna know you &apos;re lying .
and if you still don &apos;t come clean ,
i &apos;m gonna launch a formal investigation ,
whether it makes my firm look bad or not .
this is crazy . there is nothing to investigate .
well , i &apos;d rather risk looking crazy to root out an impostor
than to risk letting that impostor poison everything that i stand for .
it &apos;s over , mike .
i &apos;m on to you ,
and i &apos;m gonna expose you
for the lying piece of filth that you are .
don &apos;t forget to rinse your mouth out
after you &apos;re done throwing up .
do you remember when you said if louis knew , we &apos;d know ?
he knows .
what did he do ?
he &apos;s bringing in henry gerard to give a lecture .
so what ?
it &apos;ll only be the first time you &apos;ve had to suffer through it .
he &apos;s bringing him in because he saw
i got an a @-@ plus in his class .
what ? no one gets an a @-@ plus in gerard &apos;s class .
welcome to the problem .
god damn it .
donna , get in here .
why are you calling donna ?
because she &apos;s the one who found out that louis knows
you don &apos;t have a file in the harvard file room .
how do you know that ?
because louis &apos;s new girlfriend
is the queen of that file room ,
and she left him alone in there .
you guys didn &apos;t think to mention this ?
i thought i handled it .
she did handle it .
she sent him to sniff out your transcript .
only she didn &apos;t realize you gave yourself
an a @-@ plus in legal ethics .
i didn &apos;t give it to myself . lola jensen did .
i don &apos;t give a shit who gave it to you ,
unless it was professor gerard , which it wasn &apos;t .
how many people take the class ?
i mean , maybe mike will just be another face in the crowd .
louis is bringing him here
to see if he embraces his star student .
the worst thing i can do is just be another face in the crowd .
we need to make it so that he doesn &apos;t come .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
the man doesn &apos;t back out of commitments .
his favorite quote is &quot; for the law to work ,
there must be honor in one &apos;s word . &quot;
who &apos;s he quoting ?
himself .
pompous prick .
guy never practiced a day in his life ,
thinks he can write the book on real @-@ world ethics .
okay .
i &apos;m not panicking , but what are we gonna do ?
right now , you &apos;re gonna sit tight .
and what are you going to do ?
i think it &apos;s time to tell jessica .
we need to talk .
we do .
you know ?
no , but whatever it is , it can wait .
this isn &apos;t something that can wait .
quentin died .
i &apos;m sorry .
i knew a.l.s. wasn &apos;t gonna be a picnic .
and i knew this was coming , but it doesn &apos;t--
look , if you need some time , i can manage things here .
the truth is , harvey , i &apos;d take it .
but lisa &apos;s on her way in
to discuss quentin &apos;s will with us .
us ?
quentin named you and i co @-@ executors of his estate .
you &apos;re her husband &apos;s ex @-@ wife .
i doubt lisa sees this as just business .
no , i can &apos;t imagine she does .
can you see this as just business ?
you don &apos;t like her ,
you don &apos;t trust her , and you have good reason for both .
quentin asked me to do this .
maybe he gave you a co @-@ executor for a reason .
you &apos;re saying he was giving me an out ?
no , i &apos;m just saying that i &apos;m here ,
and you don &apos;t have to do this .
harvey , he asked me ,
and i &apos;m not going to let him down .
mike , you can &apos;t just wait for the ax to fall .
i didn &apos;t just wait . i armed myself .
i learned everything there is to know about gerard and his class .
harvey is right . this guy is a prick .
he makes everybody read his books
and then doesn &apos;t even test on them .
okay , but arming yourself isn &apos;t enough .
we need to actually do something .
harvey told me to sit tight .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna do .
right , that &apos;s because harvey &apos;s life isn &apos;t on the line .
ours is .
ours ?
mike , i am not moving in with you
because i need a new place to live .
okay , so what do you think we should do ?
what &apos;s gonna make him believe that you went to harvard ?
well , if my transcript , diploma ,
and the job you can only get by having attended harvard
aren &apos;t enough , i &apos;m not really sure what is .
well , there &apos;s got to be something you can say .
look , rachel , you know louis .
the more i try and deny it ,
the more he &apos;s gonna come after me .
i can &apos;t believe this .
he is not gonna be happy
until he has a signed full confession proving he was right .
you &apos;re right .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m gonna give him .
come on .
it &apos;s all fairly straightforward .
the company shouldn &apos;t be affected .
tim can continue with the day @-@ to @-@ day
while this works its way through probate .
well , the day @-@ to @-@ day &apos;s going to change .
how so ?
we have an offer from pryzen .
you want to sell the company ?
i want to accept an offer .
well , that was fast .
excuse me ?
what jessica is saying is
pryzen didn &apos;t waste any time swooping in .
no , what i &apos;m saying is ,
before we authorize anything ,
we need to evaluate if this is even a good idea .
i don &apos;t see why .
our general counsel thinks it &apos;s a good idea , and i agree .
and i &apos;m the one who &apos;s inheriting the majority of the company ,
so it &apos;s my decision .
actually , it isn &apos;t .
what are you talking about ?
my job is to see that quentin &apos;s wishes are fulfilled .
are you implying that you know his wishes better than i do ?
i &apos;m implying he &apos;s not dead a week ,
and you want to strip his name off the door and into oblivion .
what i want to do is put the drug
that he dedicated his life to
in the hands of a company with the resources to finish it .
and i was there
when he worked for companies like this .
and he hated them ,
which is why he went out on his own .
you were there ?
well , that &apos;s not how i heard the story .
all right , we &apos;re not doing this .
you want to sell your shares ?
no one &apos;s saying you can &apos;t .
but we have a responsibility to evaluate it .
remember when you said you &apos;d try to be conciliatory ?
i never said that .
well , you should have ,
&apos;cause you sure couldn &apos;t keep the personal out of it .
i didn &apos;t think they were gonna come at me
with all that stuff .
they weren &apos;t coming at you .
they were coming with a proposal .
do you really think that offer came out of thin air ?
i think it &apos;s possible they waited to pounce .
it &apos;s also possible
that lisa and tim put this in motion
while quentin was lying in his hospital bed .
and what if they did ?
is that really our business ?
jessica , i understand how hard this is for you ,
but his legacy is this drug .
it &apos;s not about whose name is on the company that makes it .
you &apos;re saying you agree with lisa .
i &apos;m saying to you now what i tried to tell you before .
this is personal for you . it &apos;s not personal for me .
so before we take another step ,
let me evaluate this offer .
you &apos;re right .
i lied to you .
i lied to everyone .
i cheated to get here ,
and if you put me in front of henry gerard ,
he &apos;s not gonna remember me .
&apos;cause you never took his class .
because i never went to his class .
&apos;cause you never went to harvard .
that &apos;s not true .
bullshit .
louis , please , look ,
i know you have every right to be angry with me .
i &apos;m not angry .
angry is just a flash in the pan .
my outrage is here to stay ,
and i will obliterate any infection threatening my firm .
i &apos;m not the infection you think i am .
the only thing that &apos;s bullshit is that a @-@ plus !
what ?
louis , i went to harvard . i ...
i just changed my grade .
you expect me to believe that ?
i have always been the smartest kid
at every school that i went to .
high school , college , the first two years of harvard ,
i &apos;d get &quot; a &quot; s without studying .
i &apos;d ace every test without going to class , but--
but that third year ...
you had to take gerard .
i could memorize his books ,
but his tests weren &apos;t about his books .
yeah , they &apos;re about his lectures .
the final exam--
i failed it .
i went to his office to beg for a second chance .
he doesn &apos;t give second chances .
i had to try .
he wouldn &apos;t do it .
he wasn &apos;t there .
i got to his office . it was empty .
his computer was just sitting there ,
logged in to the main system .
he was about to submit his grades .
i only had a few seconds before he came back , so ...
i decided to save myself .
no , you decided to give yourself an a @-@ plus .
no , louis .
you might not be able to believe me about anything else ever again .
believe this .
you have no idea how much i wish i could do it over again ,
because this time , i would do it right .
i would go to every class , and i would attend every lecture ,
and i would feast on what that place has to offer
like no one ever has .
but you didn &apos;t do it right the first time .
you cheated ,
and now you &apos;re looking at me to help you get away with it .
no , louis--
get out of my sight .
what a surprise .
louis , please , i just want to--
i know what you want to do-- you want to lobby me
on behalf of someone who had the audacity--
i love him .
what ?
we &apos;re moving in together ,
and we &apos;re starting a life together .
rachel--
and i &apos;m telling you this
because i know what he did
and i still love him .
okay , here &apos;s the problem .
i don &apos;t .
louis .
rachel ...
i respect you .
i care about you .
but this isn &apos;t about you .
this is about mike and what he did to me .
you know ,
he came to me the night that you asked him to be your associate .
i told him to go with you .
why ?
because he said he had a connection with you
that he &apos;s never had with harvey .
he said that ?
yes .
your shared love of the law .
yeah , i told him that .
i know .
and i have the same connection with you .
rachel , you &apos;re asking me to--
louis , he didn &apos;t do this to you .
he did it so that he can practice the thing
that we all love .
and if you don &apos;t let it go ,
he &apos;s never gonna be able to practice it again .
thank you for coming alone .
i &apos;m happy to help ,
but jessica and i are a team ,
and asking to see me alone doesn &apos;t change that .
i &apos;m not gonna cut her out of the process .
isn &apos;t that what she &apos;s doing to me ?
she &apos;s trying to kill the sale .
that &apos;s not what this letter says .
i &apos;m not a lawyer , but i &apos;m not stupid .
it says all communication goes through pearson specter .
this doesn &apos;t kill the deal .
it tells them that
they &apos;ve been negotiating with people with no power at all .
no , it tells them they have to
negotiate with two entities instead of just one .
it gives us more firepower .
what do you want , lisa ?
i want to know why your signature isn &apos;t on that letter .
because we came to a consensus ,
and she signed it on both our behalves .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i don &apos;t care .
and if you can &apos;t handle us notifying the buyer
that we &apos;re evaluating this sale ,
then it makes me question
whose judgment is really clouded .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i &apos;m done meeting behind my partner &apos;s back .
what the hell happened to letting me evaluate this offer ?
i am letting you evaluate the offer .
you sent this letter to kill the deal .
i sent that letter to buy you time .
jessica , you put my name on a document
you knew i wouldn &apos;t support .
you are on lisa &apos;s side . you want to sell .
this isn &apos;t about lisa , and i don &apos;t give a shit
whether this company is sold or not .
this is about you and me
and how we &apos;re going to run this firm .
didn &apos;t we just have a conversation about that ?
yeah , we sure did .
and when it had to do with scottie ,
you gave me a big speech about trust ,
about how i had to trust you had rational reasons
for what you were doing .
this is different .
exactly .
this time it &apos;s not personal for me .
it &apos;s personal for you .
and you &apos;re not playing by your own rules .
this deal is wrong , harvey .
and like it or not , i &apos;m still the managing partner .
not on this .
on this , you &apos;re a co @-@ executor ,
and you &apos;re not putting my name on any more letters .
so i suggest you get your head on straight
and look at this deal rationally .
and if you can &apos;t do that ,
i suggest you step aside .
jessica , you loved him .
i know you &apos;re hurting . so is she .
whatever your history with her ,
so is she .
you &apos;re here late .
the life of an associate , right ?
ah , yeah , i remember .
i used to live in this room ,
work piled all around me ,
surviving on coffee , delivery ,
and no sleep .
and the whole time , wondering ,
&quot; man , is it ever gonna get any easier ? &quot;
does it ?
no .
but you still love it .
and so do you .
or else you &apos;d be home with the woman who loves you ,
not spending your night here .
you know .
she came to see me .
i didn &apos;t think i could forgive you .
but then somehow , she ...
made me realize i could .
louis , i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
oh , no , no , no . don &apos;t thank me yet .
i &apos;m not the one you did this to .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying you did this to henry gerard .
and it &apos;s not my place to let it go for him ,
which is why you &apos;re gonna have to come clean to him .
you said it yourself
gerard doesn &apos;t give second chances .
what he does or doesn &apos;t do is up to him .
that &apos;s his right , mike ,
as the person that you wronged .
yeah , but he doesn &apos;t have to know that i wronged him .
listen to me .
you said that if you had it to do over , you &apos;d do it right .
i &apos;m giving you that chance .
take it ,
or i &apos;m gonna have to take it for you .
what are you here to do now ,
take my house away from me ?
i &apos;m here to talk .
well , the last time we talked , you pretty much said
i don &apos;t care about my husband enough to honor his wishes .
the last time we talked ,
i was an asshole .
pardon my french .
i don &apos;t mind your french .
it &apos;s come to my attention that i may have let
our history affect how i &apos;m handling this situation .
it &apos;s funny .
harvey brought that same thing to my attention .
so ...
tell me this .
why do you want to sell ?
do you know why
i lied about those a.l.s. trials ?
because i was desperate for the research to continue .
but it didn &apos;t matter .
lisa .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to die .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to live as long as he did .
we weren &apos;t trying to prolong his life .
we were trying to find a cure .
and we failed .
you never cared about the money .
the only money i cared about is the money to find the cure ,
and we don &apos;t have the resources . pryzen does .
but they already have an a.l.s. drug .
it &apos;s not as good as ours .
in profit margin , it &apos;s better .
which means there &apos;s nothing to stop them
from buying your company , burying your drug ,
and making a fortune .
what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying you didn &apos;t fail him ,
but i know how it feels to think that you did .
and i have a way to make sure that neither one of us
feels that way again .
so your great plan backfired .
harvey , i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t need you to say i &apos;m sorry .
but the next time i tell you to sit tight ,
i need you to say you will .
okay .
good , because the next time
i tell you to sit tight is right now .
wait , what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m getting on a plane to boston .
and doing what ?
i &apos;ll let you know when i get back .
why are you going to boston ?
i have to see marcus . he &apos;s in trouble .
anything i can do ?
no , i &apos;ll handle it myself .
since you &apos;re leaving , i &apos;m going to need you to draft
some language for the sainz pharmaceutical sale .
so you &apos;re in favor of it now ?
well , not exactly .
but i heard what you said , and i went to see lisa .
she and i are on the same page .
do you have time to hear what the plan is ?
i trust you .
so what do you need me to draft ?
i need you to draft a provision
that guarantees pryzen will finish developing that drug .
consider it done .
he &apos;s not seeing his brother , is he ?
no , he &apos;s not .
care to elaborate on that ?
not particularly .
you &apos;re saying i should trust him .
i &apos;m saying i do .
i &apos;d ask how you &apos;re holding up , but i can see the answer .
not well .
i can only imagine what these last couple of days
have been like for you .
but i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
but what if it &apos;s not ?
well , then we &apos;re screwed .
but that &apos;s not gonna happen .
look , donna .
i am trying so hard to be brave .
but what if louis ends up finding out everything about mike ?
what if he ends up exposing him and he actually gets arrested ?
what if he actually--
god .
rach ,
mike found out that one of our partners
ordered multiple murders .
harvey said he &apos;d fix it .
two days later , that partner was in prison .
stephen was a criminal . this is an academic .
he hasn &apos;t done anything wrong .
well , what makes harvey great at his job is he knows
that everybody has done something wrong .
even the most esteemed ethics professor in the country ?
the cleaner they look ,
the more dirt they &apos;ve swept under the rug .
i &apos;m telling you , harvey &apos;s gonna walk in there ,
he &apos;s gonna find the lump ,
and henry gerard is not gonna know what hit him .
wednesday nights , 8 : 00 to 10 : 00,
it &apos;s like clockwork .
consistency is nothing to be feared .
i wasn &apos;t afraid of it . i was counting on it .
mr. specter .
professor gerard .
looks the same as the last time i was here .
can &apos;t say you look the same as the last time you were here .
yes , you can .
i see you &apos;re as humble as ever .
we &apos;ll see who &apos;s humble in a few minutes .
and for the record ,
you were wrong about how i &apos;d turn out .
i know how you turned out .
more settlements than any other lawyer in new york .
more closings than any other lawyer in new york .
and settling is what it takes to get the job done
in the real world .
i know what it takes for you to do what you do ,
and compromising your way through life
is no way to go about the law .
i see you &apos;re as pompous as ever .
what did you come here for , mr. specter ?
i came to ask for a favor .
the answer is no .
you don &apos;t even know what it is .
i know you &apos;re the one who &apos;s asking .
i figured you &apos;d say that , which is why i brought this .
i don &apos;t consider blackmail a favor .
i doubt the trustees will care about semantics
when they see that .
well , i doubt the trustees are gonna see anything at all .
because that envelope is full of blank paper
or your dry cleaning receipts .
you think i &apos;m bluffing ?
i know you are .
if you think that envelope is meaningless ,
why don &apos;t you go ahead and open it ?
your poker face has gotten much better ,
i &apos;ll give you that .
a lot of practice , you know ,
compromising my way through life .
you know .
i know . and you talk a big game ,
but you &apos;re just as human as everyone else ,
you smug son of a bitch .
what &apos;s your favor ?
find a reason to cancel your trip on friday .
and if louis litt ever tries to contact you after that ,
don &apos;t take his call .
seems easy enough .
it is .
have a good night , professor gerard .
here &apos;s the problem , mr. specter .
i don &apos;t only talk a big game . i walk it .
and ethics is not about never doing anything wrong .
it &apos;s about making choices .
and i &apos;m not going to let you make my choice for me .
so go do whatever you &apos;re gonna do ,
but i &apos;m not canceling my trip .
you didn &apos;t get it done .
how &apos;d you know ?
because i know you would call to tell me if it &apos;s okay .
and you didn &apos;t call , so it &apos;s not okay .
then why are you so calm ?
because you &apos;ve taught me enough to know
that it &apos;s going to be okay .
it &apos;s not .
what ?
it &apos;s not gonna be okay . i don &apos;t see what we &apos;re gonna do .
what do you mean you don &apos;t see what we &apos;re gonna do ?
you &apos;re harvey specter .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means there &apos;s a gun pointed at our heads .
there &apos;s 146 things that we can do .
we just have to put our heads together and figure it out .
what the hell do you think i &apos;ve been doing
all goddamn night ?
louis has us , he &apos;s not gonna let it go ,
and there &apos;s nothing we can do to stop it .
there has to be something .
there isn &apos;t .
well , i refuse to believe that .
i don &apos;t give a shit what you believe .
get it through your head . i &apos;m not superman .
i failed , and i don &apos;t know what to do .
mike .
tim , i thought i was meeting with lisa .
and i thought you were above board .
i see you &apos;ve read our amendment .
you drafted a provision
that if they didn &apos;t spend $ 100 million finishing that drug ,
they &apos;d have to pay us an extra $ 100 million .
i drafted a provision to see
if they &apos;d put their money where their mouth is .
what you did was what you always wanted to do--
tank this deal .
they pulled the offer .
they yanked the offer .
then the deal wasn &apos;t worth anything to begin with .
what wasn &apos;t worth anything
was the document you had quentin sign
making you executor instead of me .
i didn &apos;t have quentin sign anything .
well , maybe you didn &apos;t have him sign it ,
but i know when he signed it ,
and it &apos;s not gonna hold up .
it &apos;ll hold up just fine .
we &apos;ll see .
this is a subpoena .
so the next time we have this conversation ,
you &apos;ll be under oath .
what exactly is he claiming ?
he &apos;s saying quentin wasn &apos;t competent
when he made me executor .
so let him say it .
i don &apos;t see where there &apos;s a problem .
yes , you do .
no , i don &apos;t .
just get up on the stand and testify that tim
doesn &apos;t know what he &apos;s talking about .
but he does .
quentin knew what he wanted .
they &apos;re not going to ask me that .
they &apos;re going to ask me about his condition .
i saw him , lisa .
i know what he was like .
quentin knew what he wanted .
he was also medicated , could barely speak ,
and he was in a lot of pain .
but you don &apos;t have to say those things .
i &apos;m going to have to swear to this under oath .
if making you executor wasn &apos;t legally valid ,
then why didn &apos;t you say so when he did it ?
because i didn &apos;t think it would be challenged .
and thinking something might not hold up
and keeping that thought to myself
is not the same as lying about it under oath .
well , those are some fuzzy damn lines .
i didn &apos;t make them . they came with the job .
you &apos;re gonna undo everything he &apos;s ever worked for .
maybe .
but just because you and i want the same thing
doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m willing to perjure myself to get it .
please .
you said you didn &apos;t want to fail him again .
you didn &apos;t fail .
you don &apos;t need to make me feel better .
i &apos;m not trying to make you feel better .
i &apos;m just telling you the truth .
you didn &apos;t fail because ...
we were always playing on borrowed time .
mike .
harvey .
i wouldn &apos;t have any of this without you .
i think it &apos;s time i cut your exposure .
you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s all gonna come crashing down anyway .
i &apos;m gonna go to louis .
i &apos;m going to resign ,
and i &apos;m gonna beg him to let this whole thing go .
then i &apos;m going with you .
harvey ,
when trevor went to jessica with my secret ,
i felt betrayed .
i lost my closest friend in the world .
and i know you don &apos;t like to admit it ,
but we &apos;re friends .
and i &apos;m not gonna betray my friend .
i used to hate this kind of thing .
what kind of thing ?
guest lectures . hardman used to make us sit through them .
except he gave tests afterwards .
yeah , and if you didn &apos;t pass , you got stuck on doc review .
goddamn hardman .
you remember the robinson case ?
sure do .
80,000 documents , two years of prep ,
and five months in court .
and the friday before trial started ,
he assigned you and i to proof everything .
you blew it off .
and you covered for me .
you did your half and mine , then turned it in .
he would &apos;ve fired you on the spot .
exactly , and i &apos;m here
because you didn &apos;t sell out a friend then ,
but you &apos;re about to now .
mike .
me .
friend ?
louis , i may not ever say it ,
but that &apos;s not because we aren &apos;t .
we are . you know it .
i know it .
i just don &apos;t like to say it .
last time i asked you , you said , &quot; don &apos;t push it . &quot;
you knew i meant yes .
i did .
so mike told you .
he did .
what &apos;d you say ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
bottom line is i forgave him because i don &apos;t care
what some stupid piece of paper says .
and i want you to forgive him too .
oh , harvey , i did forgive him .
i just can &apos;t cover it up for him .
you covered it up with hardman for me .
what you did that weekend
is not the same as what he did to professor gerard .
what &apos;s the same is hardman wouldn &apos;t have let it go ,
and gerard won &apos;t let it go .
you make mike confess ,
you might as well throw his life down the toilet .
harvey , he didn &apos;t just betray us .
he betrayed the law .
he did .
that &apos;s not right .
it isn &apos;t .
but forgiveness isn &apos;t about right and wrong .
louis , i know you value the letter of the law ,
but what about its spirit ?
because mike embodies
that spirit more than either one of us .
you said we &apos;re friends .
a friend would not ask me to do this .
no , louis .
a friend just won &apos;t hold it against you if you don &apos;t .
do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth ,
and nothing but the truth , so help you god ?
i do .
but before we start , i &apos;d like to make a statement .
i am here to tell the truth ,
but what i want you to understand
is that truth is subjective .
the truth is the truth .
no . the law is the law .
we can define where a legal line is .
i &apos;m talking about the truth .
the truth is much more complicated .
by the letter of the law ,
quentin sainz may or may not have been competent .
i can &apos;t say what &apos;s true with 100 % certainty .
法学博士
i just don &apos;t know .
but what i can say with certainty
is that quentin knew what he was doing
when he trusted me to look after his best interests .
how do you know that ?
because i knew him .
just because someone can &apos;t check off everything
on the list that &apos;s required to be competent doesn &apos;t mean
they aren &apos;t better at whatever they do than the rest of us .
and quentin sainz was an amazing man
with an amazing mind .
and if he were here right now ,
i &apos;d still listen to him on any subject
sooner than i &apos;d listen to anybody else .
that &apos;s all very touching ,
but we &apos;re not here to talk about the truth .
we &apos;re here to deal with the letter of the law .
have you never met someone who by the letter of the law
shouldn &apos;t be able to do what they do ,
who beat the odds ?
your honor--
we are talking about a man &apos;s life .
we are talking about his legacy .
and i dispute that those things are less important
than the letter of the law .
your honor , what has to happen today is very clear .
you have to undo this injustice .
yes . this is about justice .
but the issue isn &apos;t whether quentin sainz was competent
when he made me executor , but rather ,
would it have been his intent to do so if he were .
this man dedicated his life to one thing ,
and the circumstances surrounding how he decided
to protect that thing is not the question .
it &apos;s a question of law , ms. pearson .
no , it is a question of doing what is right .
louis .
what the hell are you doing here ?
i--
i told you i needed
the carell filings by lunch-- you didn &apos;t get that done ,
so now you don &apos;t get to listen to this lecture .
you do not get to listen to this titan talk about legal ethics .
you know something , you make me sick .
so do me a quick favor and tell him you &apos;re sorry
and get the hell out of here .
i &apos;m sorry .
i accept your apology ,
but i &apos;m not the aggrieved one here .
louis is .
louis ...
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
it &apos;s not my pony . come on .
motion to remove jessica pearson as executor denied .
well , you were right .
quentin did know what he was doing .
i know how hard it must have been ...
at the end .
i &apos;m glad quentin had you .
i &apos;m glad he had you too .
he let it go .
i heard it all worked out .
never a doubt .
i &apos;ve got a present for you .
tiffany .
&quot; d.j.s. &quot;
this is a present for scottie .
which makes it a present for you .
let &apos;s put this in her office .
great .
we can put it next to your overpriced bottle of scotch .
so it was a great gift .
now it is .
for the record , her middle name is victoria .
no , it isn &apos;t .
what is it ?
please , she never told me .
julie ?
seriously ?
j essie ?
oh , my god .
joy ?
you &apos;re pathetic .
jenny ?
not telling .
i don &apos;t think this is a good idea .
i don &apos;t care .
what are they gonna do , fire us ?
mike , i haven &apos;t left before 5 : 00
in the past six years .
all the more reason to do it .
now what do you want to do ?
see a movie , grab dinner , get a drink ?
i just want to go home .
yeah . let &apos;s go home .
people seem to keep coming in here lately .
i needed to hear some music .
and drink some scotch .
how often do you really do one without the other ?
move over .
did you take care of your marcus problem ?
for the time being .
good .
it wasn &apos;t really a marcus problem .
i know .
you want to hear the truth ?
not tonight .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you in the first place .
i know .
