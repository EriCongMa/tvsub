it &apos;s the bottom of the ninth . can he do it ?
and ... it &apos;s ... gone !
home run ! manny &quot; mega &quot; vega has done it !
the upstart expansion team boston pilgrims
will live in the shadow of the red sox no more !
they are one game away from the playoffs !
good morning , boston early risers .
that &apos;s if you pilgrims fans even went to sleep .
i &apos;m still celebrating manny &quot; mega &quot; vega &apos;s moon shot
over the left @-@ field fence .
this afternoon game was even a bigger one ,
as the pilgrims continue to fight for a playoff spot
in a tough division ...
what a game last night
the pilgrims are on a streak with &quot; mega &quot; vega .
chimpanzees do that .
do what ?
grab their crotches . it &apos;s a sign of aggression .
welcome back to &quot; baseball live . &quot;
how exciting is this ?
two boston teams competing for playoff berths .
but what the red sox don &apos;t have is manny &quot; mega &quot; vega .
man , that mega vega sure can hit .
&quot; mega &quot; stands for &quot; molecular evolutionary genetics analysis . &quot;
oh , he is quite the male specimen .
mega focus . mega power .
drink my mega ade to win every time .
i &apos;d love to mega him .
oh , hey . language . my mother &apos;s here .
you should hear us when you &apos;re not around policing us .
he &apos;s a hunk .
&quot; hunk &quot; ?
officially throwing up in my mouth .
no -- jo friday , stop licking .
oh , don &apos;t yell at her .
that &apos;s not yelling .
stop licking !
that &apos;s yelling .
... speaking of a kiss goodbye .
co @-@ owners no more .
phil young announced today that he controls the pilgrims .
must be pretty upsetting for the ex @-@ wife , geena .
that &apos;s too bad .
well , at least they &apos;re fighting over a baseball team .
my parents are fighting over the snow shovel .
i doubt it will .
oh , my god . tommy .
i forgot to tell you he was coming home .
you forgot to tell me ? did you forget , too ?
janey .
hi .
thanks for your letters . they really kept me going .
i was looking for you three months ago .
yeah . i got in a little fight in the yard .
they threw me back in , so ...
yeah , well , let &apos;s not screw up your early release , okay ?
fresh start , yeah ?
yeah .
dr. isles , i tightened up the flush valve in the guest house .
thank you . please let me pay you .
no , not a chance .
i mean , it &apos;s the least i can do , you know ?
for all you &apos;re doing for me .
&quot; all &quot; you &apos;re doing for him ?
he &apos;s just visiting your mother .
&quot; visiting &quot; means dropping by and then leaving .
when &apos;s he leaving ?
jane , he &apos;s gonna be in violation of his probation
without a permanent address .
so the visit is permanent .
temporarily .
the only thing that tommy does &quot; temporarily &quot;
is stay out of trouble .
jane , i know you .
you &apos;re conflicted , you want to help him ,
but you &apos;re afraid that anything you do
will be interpreted as a sign of approval .
my little brother is a screw @-@ up , maura ,
a completely lovable screw @-@ up felon .
the recidivism rate for non @-@ violent offenders
is higher than for violent .
it &apos;s 46 % to 39 % .
so i &apos;m thinking this isn &apos;t a good idea .
i &apos;m doing this for your mother .
you know , he &apos;s made some bad choices ,
but that doesn &apos;t make him a bad person .
oh , yeah , right . he did fix your flush valve .
she &apos;s licking her paws .
yeah , they &apos;re real red .
i know . i know .
this is dr. isles .
okay , if the division detectives have signed off ,
i will authorize removal of the body .
thank you .
fatal slip and fall at the pilgrims &apos; locker room .
that &apos;s weird they &apos;re not reporting it .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve never been to the pilgrims &apos; stadium ,
and their locker room is closer than your couch .
come on .
well , i &apos;ve always wanted to see them without their uniforms .
maura !
this is dr. isles again .
uh , hold the body at the scene .
i &apos;m coming in . thank you .
hey , listen . i know you &apos;re a little busy .
um , you know , if you want , i can take your dog to the vet .
no , your only job is -- is just stay out of trouble , okay ?
bye , ma .
bye , baby .
body &apos;s in the shower , dr. isles .
it &apos;s nice to see you , detective merck .
actually , it &apos;s chief merck now .
of course . congratulations .
thank you .
what brings you out , rizzoli ?
just tagging along . look at you .
you retire , land the plum job ,
chief of security for the pilgrims .
yeah , it &apos;s a long way from working those late nights in homicide .
hey , listen , while you &apos;re here , we treat boston &apos;s finest
to a couple of tickets on the first @-@ base line .
i &apos;ve only sat in the nosebleeds
on police @-@ appreciation day -- thanks .
what &apos;s this look like to you ?
uh , it &apos;s pretty sad . it &apos;s a poor fella on our coaching staff
slipped and fell in the shower this morning .
team &apos;s pretty shook up about it .
oh , the coaching staff ? that &apos;s awful . yeah . hey , listen .
why don &apos;t you go out and enjoy the game ?
i &apos;ll walk her through this ,
and i &apos;ll have her out by the bottom of the first .
well , if it &apos;s okay with you ,
i &apos;m gonna , uh , wait here for dr . isles , all right ?
uh , yeah , all right . sure .
let me , uh -- let me go check on her , all right ?
... three , four , five , six , seven ...
you got to be kidding .
oh , wow . manny &quot; mega &quot; vega in the flesh .
... two , three , four , five , six , seven ...
i guess we must look pretty strange .
well , does he always puke before a game ?
yeah , yeah . baseball players are really superstitious .
part of his ritual .
i &apos;m jesse wade .
detective jane rizzoli .
and i know who you are .
uh , rookie of the year when you came into the bigs ,
two @-@ time all @-@ star .
impressive .
most women only know the superstar ,
mr. mega vega .
well , confession -- i &apos;m a big red sox fan ,
but , you know , maybe you guys can convert me .
yeah . maybe .
man , you better move and get out of my way .
man , you shouldn &apos;t even have a locker , the way you &apos;re hitting .
all right .
is that part of his ritual , too ?
no .
the ... dead guy in the shower &apos;s got everybody spooked .
call me .
wouldn &apos;t mind being interrogated by you .
heard that line , like , four million times .
you call me , and , uh , i &apos;ll think of a new one .
all right .
feel good ? yeah .
what &apos;s a coach doing in the players &apos; showers ?
coaches , players , managers
all have access to the gym and the showers .
what time did he come in ?
the records show 6 : 00 a.m.
what is it ?
i &apos;m not sure .
it &apos;s a slip and fall . can we just get him out of here ?
his body &apos;s already in advanced rigor .
that &apos;s very simple -- the hot water was running
when the cleaning lady found him .
hot water does accelerate it .
it &apos;s this ...
radiating circular skull fracture consistent with a hard impact ,
and this -- a second compression fracture to the occiput .
two skull fractures ? how ? he fell once .
well , he slipped ,
cracked his head on the shower handle , hit the floor .
that &apos;s not what you &apos;re thinking , is it ?
the gash is wider than the shower handle .
something else struck his skull .
a weapon ? wh-- you got to use your best guess .
if there &apos;s any chance this was a murder --
murder ? !
rizzoli , what the hell ? there &apos;s no murder here .
is it a suspicious death ?
what does your gut say ?
i don &apos;t listen to my intestines .
maura .
i &apos;m declaring the manner of this death suspicious
pending further investigation --
by the homicide unit .
take your v.i.p. seats .
boston homicide sits in the nosebleeds .
got the page from operations .
what &apos;s going on ? i &apos;m missing the game .
yeah , so is he .
oh , boy .
that guy got hit by more than a pitch .
what &apos;s dr. isles say ?
suspicious death .
and their million @-@ dollar lawyers
won &apos;t let us touch anything until the warrant gets here .
victim &apos;s a member of the coaching staff .
ron mckenna .
i knew them all , right down to the bat boys .
never heard of this guy .
hey , you get it all ?
judge polk gave you the locker room ,
but he won &apos;t give you the stadium .
i &apos;m not surprised . he probably called the governor .
he &apos;s not gonna cancel this game .
what about the , uh , dumpsters ?
judge said no .
fine . i &apos;ll type up another warrant
and a find a judge who doesn &apos;t have pilgrims box seats .
okay . your retirement .
merck the jerk .
all he ever talked about was the sox .
when that job went to celluci ,
he sold his soul to get this one .
he was in homicide 15 years .
you think he did clean @-@ up ?
let &apos;s find out .
here . you know the drill .
uh , this is our house now .
you can read that on the way out .
okay , i want all the dumpsters frozen .
i want a man in front of every one of them .
oh , come on i got to dumpster dive
through 40,000 hot dogs and blue shaved ice ?
go before they empty it .
if there &apos;s any evidence in there , we don &apos;t want to lose it .
hey , hey . did you get my text about the tommy surprise ?
yeah , why didn &apos;t ma tell us ?
at least she &apos;s not trying to throw him
another &quot; welcome home &quot; party .
yeah , because he doesn &apos;t have one .
let &apos;s keep an eye on him , all right ?
well , as the team owner , you and your lawyers
must know why we want to talk to you .
well , my head of security , chief merck ,
informs me that we &apos;ve had a tragic accident , officer .
detective .
tragic , yes . accident , we don &apos;t think so .
so we will be conducting a full investigation .
that &apos;s very thorough of you to dot
your i &apos;s and cross your t &apos;s . see ?
i knew they weren &apos;t gonna try to use our tragedy
to make names for themselves .
ron mckenna &apos;s badge identifies him as one of your coaches ,
but i didn &apos;t see his name on your roster .
well , mr. mckenna was a recent addition to our coaching staff .
oh ? what kind ?
hitting coach ? pitching ? base coach ?
special @-@ assignment coach .
what was his special assignment ?
i &apos;m sorry , detective ,
but your warrant doesn &apos;t cover this part of the house ,
nor does it give you the right
to interrogate anyone in this organization .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;d like to help .
i represent the entire organization .
you will not speak with anyone other than me .
what is she doing here ?
you better get down there and tell geena
she &apos;s about to be in violation of her restraining order .
well , since you don &apos;t represent geena ,
i guess there is someone to talk to , huh , walt ?
sports guys are saying
phil took geena &apos;s share of the team , locked her out .
well , he looks like someone who &apos;d put up a fight .
i wonder how he managed it .
i have every right to be in that stadium . that is my team .
get all these guys out of here , all right ?
mrs. young , boston homicide . can we talk to you , please ?
homicide ?
so , it &apos;s true about ron .
that bastard won &apos;t let me in .
you knew ron mckenna ?
of course . i insisted we hire him .
let me guess -- phil is stonewalling .
well , he said that you hired mckenna
as a special @-@ assignment coach .
oh , yeah . a special assignment , all right .
he was manny vega &apos;s sober coach .
you had a sober coach for your star player ?
it &apos;s no secret manny has had issues .
it was under control , and then about three weeks ago ,
he started having violent outbursts again .
didn &apos;t take a genius to recognize that he needed help ,
so i brought in ron --
right before my asshole ex @-@ husband locked me out .
but how is vega passing his alcohol @-@ and @-@ drug tests ?
ask phil .
and while you &apos;re at it ,
tell him he won &apos;t have my team for long .
i &apos;d lock her out , too .
stepping up to bat , d.j. nixon !
rumor is , phil &apos;s trying to sell the team to salt lake city .
the utah pilgrims ?
how long am i standing here ?
until we have a warrant .
vega was a wicked drinker in his new york days --
locker @-@ room brawls , allegations of juicing .
well , maybe he snapped
when his sober coach tried to take away his tequila .
garbage ? thank you .
hey ! you think i &apos;m standing here to throw away your mess ?
wait , wait , wait , wait .
these have never been worn . this is brand @-@ new .
backs of his shoes are wet .
he was dragged into the shower with his clothes on .
not in these clothes .
he didn &apos;t die in the showers .
this whole thing was staged .
oh , wait . oh . up there . you see that ?
directional bloodspatter .
somebody swung away in here .
smells like bleach .
the count is two and two .
lindbeck winds up , delivers his knuckle ball .
vega swings .
it &apos;s hit deep .
deep over salgado &apos;s head , and ...
gone !
somebody cleaned up a murder .
the murder weapon is a cylindrical , heavy , hard object .
gee , what could it be ?
think it &apos;s a pipe ?
a pipe is too thin .
what about a majorette &apos;s baton ?
i &apos;m glad that you find my scientific approach amusing .
i think it &apos;s a bat , maura .
found blood .
i think it &apos;s manny vega &apos;s bat .
let &apos;s compare it to the injury .
the width of the barrel aligns with the width of the fracture .
so vega &apos;s our best bet .
now , how do we prove he swung the fatal blow ?
the way you always do -- do that gumshoe thing .
&quot; that gumshoe thing &quot; ?
no , um , this time ,
we &apos;re actually up against every baseball fan ,
from judges to the governor .
so it makes it a little difficult to do my gumshoe thing .
society &apos;s very reluctant to hold celebrities accountable .
remember fatty arbuckle ?
fatty arbuckle ?
no .
the silent @-@ film star who was tried .
stop .
hey , jane , our victim had multiple drug arrests .
so , this is who they hire to be the &quot; sober coach &quot; ?
heard you got the warrant for the dumpsters .
yeah . i got blood , too --
on vega &apos;s bat .
it &apos;s korsak .
he &apos;s interviewing the victim &apos;s son .
can you figure out
what &apos;s going on with the searches through the dumpsters ?
yeah , yeah . i &apos;ll check with frankie .
i &apos;m off -- to do my ... gumshoe thing .
i shouldn &apos;t have used that term .
no , you shouldn &apos;t have .
because it actually refers to galoshes ,
which you aren &apos;t wearing .
what ? i ... what did i say ?
we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
you &apos;re the only ones .
the news , the radio --
they &apos;re calling my dad a scum bag .
we will do everything we can to find his killer .
i hate to ask , but ...
do you know anyone that might have wanted to hurt your father ?
he &apos;s been clean since my mom died .
pulled it together for me .
how long had he been clean ?
five years .
he , uh , started an outreach center to help people .
why don &apos;t they report that ?
did your father ever tell you anything
about his work with manny vega ?
just that he was trying to help him .
he helped a lot of those guys .
you mean other ballplayers ?
yeah .
he blew his own shot at the pros with drugs .
that &apos;s why he wasn &apos;t star @-@ struck .
he used to be one of them , s @-@ so he -- he could connect .
yeah . good to see you .
always a pleasure . all right .
we just got shut down .
search warrant on vega &apos;s house and car was denied .
no grand jury on vega , either .
what ?
how can merck shut down a grand @-@ jury investigation ?
by delaying it till after the playoffs .
and all the heavies are telling us to back off .
yeah , tell that to ron mckenna &apos;s son .
i didn &apos;t tell you to stop , rizzoli .
now find a way to get to vega .
nice .
cavanaugh just took the gloves off . come on .
hey , mega . can i get an autograph ?
give me the ball . let &apos;s go .
did you miss your lucky bat today ?
we had to borrow it .
you &apos;re a cop .
listen , get the hell away from me and move your car .
oh , sorry . is that blocking you ?
ron mckenna &apos;s blood is all over your bat , vega .
how &apos;d it get there ?
i &apos;m not talking to you guys .
i &apos;m calling my lawyers .
ron bust you for drinking ? maybe that &apos;s why you killed him .
i didn &apos;t kill nobody .
now move your damn car .
phil , merck , your lawyers --
they can &apos;t protect you forever .
get out of my face .
at least i got his autograph .
did merck &apos;s timeline check out ?
yep .
victim goes in at 6 : 01 a.m. never comes out .
cleaning lady goes in at 9 : 30 , out at 9 : 33 .
after she found the body .
players don &apos;t use key cards
because they come through the players gate .
so , we &apos;re never gonna find a record
of vega entering or exiting .
hey , turn it up .
look , it &apos;s gross incompetence by boston police .
this was an accident . ron mckenna slipped and fell .
what do we have on this cream puff ?
phils ? nothing , other than he &apos;s an asshole .
oh , look at all those drug convictions .
you guys were great to give him a second chance .
it &apos;s unfortunate he couldn &apos;t cure his own addiction .
you just -- you ... - what about vega &apos;s drug tests ?
every time he takes a leak , someone &apos;s there with a cup .
all negative .
no steroids , narcotics , or alcohol .
that &apos;s according to the team doctors .
they got our backs against the wall .
find somebody who will talk .
jesse wade gave me his phone number .
maybe it &apos;s time to make a call .
yeah .
a booty call .
really ?
what is &quot; le beau truc &quot; ?
five @-@ star french restaurant .
brilliant nouveau take on escargot .
is this okay ?
are you out of your mind ?
what ? i &apos;m meeting jesse wade .
he wants to do the interview there .
at le beau truc ?
yeah .
le booty call .
what did you just say ?
i know .
unzip me .
wh-- why ?
because you can &apos;t go like that .
we &apos;ll trade clothes . come on .
are you crazy ?
that dress wouldn &apos;t ... cover my ... booty .
it smells like a deco .
oh , men are not attracted to the smell of death .
really ?
okay , that &apos;s enough .
those boots are fashion homicide .
no . no ! those shoes are foot homicide .
put them on .
they &apos;re too small .
give them back .
you just said put them on !
patience .
what are you do--
maura !
voila . peep toes .
thank you .
you look sexy .
you look ...
like you &apos;re wearing my clothes .
hi , ma .
okay . calm down .
tommy , why you have ma &apos;s phone ?
all ri-- where are you ?
okay . i &apos;ll be right --
i got 45 minutes .
come with me . i &apos;m gonna need backup .
what ? jane , what did tommy do ?
jane ! you have all the shoes !
you think you can do that to people , huh ?
take advantage of them when
they &apos;re just trying to take care of their pets ?
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna neuter you , punk !
hey . tommy , stop . stop .
i called the police .
i am the police .
vice ?
homicide .
i &apos;m not there yet , but give me a minute .
all right . relax .
just ... what happened ?
jo friday was licking her freaking paws off !
shhh ! i &apos;m not talking to you .
what happened ?
i was treating this patient , uh , jo friday rizzoli ,
and this man is refusing to pay the bill .
all right . well , that &apos;s fine .
i got it . i will pay it . how much is it ?
$ 300 .
what ?
what did you do , bling her paws out ?
exactly . and then he calls her a freaking head case !
no , no , no , no , no . i did not use that terminology .
i said , &quot; she is suffering from depression . &quot;
she has been withdrawn , restless ,
reluctant to go outside and urinate .
whose side are you on ?
she sleeps , eats , poops .
what &apos;s there to be depressed about ?
n-- off , jo friday !
it is an ocd reflex .
it is triggered by her emotional state .
she needs prozac .
here we go .
ocd , adhd , alcoholic --
same stuff they were throwing at me in the joint !
i &apos;m not surprised you were confined to a cage .
knock it off !
knock it off , all right ?
take jo friday , go home ! take her for a walk .
you &apos;re already gonna blow your curfew as it is . come on .
i &apos;m so sorry .
they really are very nice people .
you look phenomenal .
thank you .
i thought we ought to stay kind of private .
i &apos;m not really supposed to be talking to you .
well , i &apos;m not supposed to be drinking .
i &apos;m on the job , so ...
um , tell me about vega .
you guys have been teammates for , what , two seasons ?
man , you get right into it .
yep .
i don &apos;t know . uh ...
feels like he &apos;s losing it .
what do you mean ?
just acting crazy , except when he takes the bat .
well , do you think he killed ron mckenna ?
you &apos;re the homicide detective . what do you think ?
well , it doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
it matters what i can prove .
can you prove it ?
what was ron mckenna doing in the locker room at 6 : 00 a.m. ?
i don &apos;t know .
yes , you do .
was he trying to prove that vega was drinking and drugging ? what ?
yeah . he was hell @-@ bent on it , so ... maybe , yeah .
well , you and manny are friends .
did you ever talk to ron about it , try to help ?
ron came to me the day before he died .
wanted my help staging an intervention for manny .
i was up for it .
but vega &apos;s drug tests came back clean .
when you &apos;re the face on the billboard ,
the name on a sports drink ...
your pee has a tendency to come back drug @-@ free .
okay .
you know , i didn &apos;t just ... come here to talk about the case .
you &apos;re such a beautiful woman .
i thought we &apos;d have some wine .
thank you .
um , but , like i said , i &apos;m on the job .
okay .
these suck .
and your dress is about as comfortable as a straitjacket .
yeah , and your suit is a real booty @-@ call magnet .
i got hit on twice -- by women .
really ?
oh , no . my tv -- it &apos;s gone .
somebody was in here .
ma ! tommy ! ma !
ma , come here !
jane , what &apos;s wrong ?
tommy ?
well , maybe it wasn &apos;t tommy . i ...
i told the palumbos
tommy would never steal their stereo .
tommy broke into some houses when he was in high school .
um ... he never should have been staying here , maura .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
oh , for the life of me !
i don &apos;t understand why your brother does what he does !
all right , look .
i &apos;ll call frankie , okay ,
and then we &apos;ll go look for tommy .
if he &apos;s on the run , it should be us that find him , okay ?
come here , ma .
it &apos;s all right . okay ?
i &apos;ll find him .
oh , don &apos;t move , babe . the police got us surrounded .
you &apos;re so funny , tommy .
actually , babe , move .
so , uh , which one of youse wants to ... take me in ?
where &apos;d you get the money to buy
the dinner and drinks for the townie ?
did you pawn maura &apos;s stuff ? huh ?
maura &apos;s house was burglarized .
her tv , her jewelry ...
her trust .
she trusted you .
oh , you think i did it ?
did you ?
yeah , sure .
recession &apos;s my fault , mom and dad
are getting divorced because of me .
war in the middle east -- that &apos;s me , too .
is that what you think ?
they &apos;re not getting a divorce because of you , tommy .
they fought all the time .
they fought over the freaking leaves in the gutters , tommy .
i am the freaking gutter .
it &apos;s detective rizzoli , officer rizzoli ,
and tommy the screw @-@ up .
that &apos;s what you &apos;ve chosen . that &apos;s not who you are .
we have a breaking story . manny &quot; mega &quot; vega ...
hey , could you turn that up , please ?
... has been killed in an automobile accident .
details at this time are inconclusive ,
but detectives are looking into the matter .
of course , we &apos;ll have much more on this story as it develops .
tommy , you &apos;re on your own tonight .
no babysitters for you .
once again , manny &quot; mega &quot; vega ,
boston pilgrims baseball superstar ,
has died tonight in a fatal car accident .
wonder if he &apos;ll go down as one of the best hitters of all time
or the baseball star who murdered his sober coach
and then died in a d.u.i.
got the results from the contents of the sports bottle .
oh , from his car ? that was fast .
i processed it myself .
that guy was my hero .
i wanted to know if he was loaded .
was he ?
can you put it down here ?
no .
glucose water , &quot; b &quot; vitamins ,
taurine , ginseng , caffeine .
no drugs , alcohol , or steroids ?
no .
this is strange .
cardiomyopathy .
he has an enlarged heart .
congenital ?
no . recent damage .
maura , you have that
&quot; i have a case @-@ solving hunch &quot; look on your face .
my face doesn &apos;t hunch .
it &apos;s minor pruritus .
excuse me ?
an itch .
his kidneys are damaged .
look at that crystallization .
yeah . from what ?
i &apos;d be guessing .
god , it &apos;s torture sometimes .
have you seen this before ?
yes .
okay . good .
what did it turn out to be ...
before ?
ethylene glycol ingestion .
antifreeze ?
someone was poisoning him .
somebody was poisoning vega over a three @-@ week period .
was it merck , phil , geena , or one of his teammates ?
look , we &apos;ve got nothing without motive .
mckenna is collateral damage .
now , somebody was after vega . who and why ?
okay , it &apos;s got to be somebody who could get into the locker room
through the players gate ,
which says &quot; teammate &quot; to me .
wait . frost , can you go on youtube
and pull up that dugout fight between jacobs and vega ?
they were going at it in the locker room .
get out of my face !
hate &apos;s a powerful motive .
maura &apos;s got something on our first vic -- sober coach .
you can &apos;t look at a little vitreous fluid ?
coming out of an eyeball ?
come on . you said you had something .
what are we doing standing here ?
time of death is always hard to pin down .
it &apos;s even harder in this case .
you could be a little more patient .
job was like a cranky toddler compared to me .
you spoke to frankie ?
he &apos;s still going through all 12 dumpsters
with every division detective we could spring loose .
and why aren &apos;t you there ?
oh , i know . &quot; ew ! i hate eyeball fluid .
ew , i &apos;m afraid of garbage . &quot;
why aren &apos;t you there ? i know .
might mess up that nice sport coat from 1989 .
all right . come on .
so , geena hired mckenna
because she thought vega was drinking again .
yeah . she said he &apos;d been having violent outbursts .
ethylene @-@ glycol poisoning mimics inebriation .
but we didn &apos;t find any traces of antifreeze in vega &apos;s water bottle .
yeah , at least not the one in his car .
no , w-- that &apos;s it . wait a minute .
uh , baseball players are real superstitious , right ?
oh , mark mcgwire wore the same cup
from his high @-@ school @-@ playing days
until it was stolen from him late in his career .
clemens put tiger balm on his bal--
his balls ?
yeah .
don &apos;t they inspect those before they &apos;re allowed to pitch ?
different ...
balls , dr. isles .
let &apos;s just say they -- they have some weird rituals .
yeah , like drinking from the same blinged @-@ out game bottle .
let &apos;s test the one in his locker .
this is definitely the source of the ethylene glycol .
so our killer was spiking vega &apos;s special game bottle .
easy access -- just sitting in his locker .
just had to wait until the locker room was empty .
poor ron mckenna -- he suspects vega &apos;s drinking
decides to check his locker after the game ...
catches the murderer red @-@ handed .
killer grabs vega &apos;s bat , whacks mckenna in the head
drags him to the showers .
smashes his skull against the tile ,
stages a slip @-@ and @-@ fall accident .
clark jacobs could be our guy .
he &apos;s got a locker right next to vega .
there it is -- results for the hypoxanthine test .
the vitreous fluid from the eye .
you did have a hunch .
no , i simply couldn &apos;t explain
his advanced stage of rigor mortis .
and here &apos;s why --
cause ron mckenna wasn &apos;t murdered at 6 : 00 a.m.
he died six hour earlier
at midnight ?
so why did merck and his key card say 6 : 00 a.m. ?
i think our buddy merck is lying to us .
you &apos;re looking at an accessory to murder .
whoa . i didn &apos;t kill anybody .
so why &apos;d you alter his key @-@ card entry time ?
i didn &apos;t .
well , maybe he &apos;s a zombie .
that &apos;s why he took a shower six hours after he died .
maybe you got me on obstruction ...
but not murder .
okay .
works for me .
hey . hey , hey .
we thought manny did it .
i was told to protect him .
who told you to do that ?
i &apos;m not saying anymore , i want a lawyer .
you learn that trick in all your years as a homicide cop ?
lawyering up like the scum bag you are ?
i say either phil or geena told merck to protect vega .
whoa . crime @-@ scene techs found vega &apos;s contract on his computer .
whoa . $ 15 million a year .
plus , phil and geena sweetened the deal .
they each gave him a piece of the team .
1 % each .
yeah , nice chunk , since that franchise
is worth half a billion dollars .
right .
huh . read the fine print .
if vega tests positive for drugs or alcohol or dies ,
both team owners get their shares back .
puts phil and geena right back at square one
without their star .
what &apos;s the motive ?
what &apos;s that addendum ?
okay , that &apos;s weird .
three weeks ago ,
vega gave phil his entire 2 % share of the team .
why ?
give phil control ?
that &apos;s how phil took the team from geena .
he must have had a side deal with vega .
he had to . it &apos;s the only way
phil could sell the team to utah .
yeah , and then geena discovers that she was betrayed by vega .
that &apos;s motive . you know ?
maybe she -- she hired merck to do the dirty work .
well , well , well .
merck just got bailed out -- by geena .
and tommy didn &apos;t do it .
what ?
division @-@ one detectives matched fingerprints
from dr . isles &apos; bedroom to a burglary ring .
they &apos;ve made arrests and got all her stuff back .
that &apos;s fantastic !
hey , frankie .
no , listen to this .
you what ?
i think we found the needle in the haystack .
unbelievable . let me see .
gotcha .
i know we got nothing on the outside ,
but what about on the inside ?
can you get a print ?
this is not &quot; csi : boston , &quot; jane , okay ?
it &apos;s a very delicate process ,
and it &apos;s not always successful .
be great if it was successful this time .
i can &apos;t concentrate .
did you apologize to tommy ?
no , but i will .
let &apos;s just get the bad guys first , all right ?
all right .
well , why don &apos;t you go and apologize to him ,
and i &apos;ll call you if i get any latent prints .
&quot; if &quot; ?
n -- the reason you have these gloves to work with
is because i gumshoed .
the least you can do is get me some prints .
what are you -- why are you stopping ?
what are you doing ?
waiting for you to leave .
wh -- you are ridiculous .
fine . bye .
tommy ?
tommy ?
what , you gonna make me use the siren ?
knock it off .
you &apos;re scaring lola and finn .
we caught the burglars .
maura got all her stuff back .
well , that &apos;s too bad &apos; cause i was really looking forward
to three square meals a day and a clean jumpsuit .
go home .
i don &apos;t have a home .
yes , you do .
maura said that you can stay as long as you need to .
ma wants you there . maura wants you there .
you know what &apos;s great about dogs ?
tell me .
they &apos;re in the same mood every day .
and they think i &apos;m a good guy .
they &apos;re good judges of character , tommy .
they &apos;d like a serial killer
if he had lamb lungs .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m really , really sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
i would have thought i did it , too .
i got to walk them .
i &apos;m on the job .
you &apos;re a dog walker ? that &apos;s great .
oh , yeah . mom and dad will be so proud .
see you later .
tell me you got a print .
way to go .
thank you .
way to go .
thank you .
great game . that was a great game .
thank you .
it was close . congratulations .
hey , you can &apos;t be in here !
keep talking , i &apos;ll have your bail revoked .
phil ...
... you screwed geena out of her team .
and , geena ,
you would do almost anything
to get that team back , wouldn &apos;t you ?
and , merck ...
... you just do what you &apos;re told .
and , jesse ...
... you wanted to be a superstar .
i got to admit , you got balls taking a cop to dinner .
did you think you could charm me , too ?
you like that sound , don &apos;t you ?
sound of adoring fans .
you wanted what vega had --
face on the billboard , name on the sports drink .
what &apos;s this about , officer ?
detective .
i think jesse knows what this is about , don &apos;t you , jesse ?
i worked for this .
everything was handed to him .
he drank and drugged , and they just kept ...
giving him more .
my god . no .
you killed manny ?
turn around , jesse .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murders
of manny vega and ron mckenna .
a little to the left .
ok now . to the right . to the right .
center it a little .
wait , don &apos;t -- don &apos;t drop it , korsak .
this thing costs more than you make in a month .
that &apos;s still more than you make in six months .
dinner time !
hello , jo friday !
you want your dinner ? yes .
you feed that dog chicken ?
it &apos;s organic .
she licking her paws ?
yeah , nonstop .
that &apos;s because she &apos;s depressed .
what ? it &apos;s not funny .
i paid 300 bucks . she &apos;s still licking .
because a lot of little dogs like her
are allergic to poultry .
&quot; well , she has been withdrawn and restless ,
reluctant to go outside and urinate . &quot;
well , excuse me .
i don &apos;t treat mixed breeds or four @-@ legged creatures
or anything else -- - that &apos;s alive .
yeah , i forgot .
okay , knock it off , you two . get the salad .
would you like me to reimburse you
for misdiagnosing your dog ?
stop it .
yes .
yes , i would , actually . that &apos;d be nice .
would a check be okay , or would you feel safer with cash ?
