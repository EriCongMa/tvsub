As surgeons,
we're trained to consult with each other...
to get opposing views.
Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
Aortic pulmonary dissection.
Yes! No.
Wait, no. That's not right.
Well, what I'm-- what I'm saying is
I finally understand the complexities
of postobstructive pulmonary edema.
Uh-huh.
We even encourage patients to seek second opinions.
Because I've been up since 4:00 a.m.,
studying for the boards with Callie.
Since 4:00 a.m.
I haven't seen my husband or my baby since yesterday.
I don't even care,
because Callie blew my mind.
She blew my mind.
My hair is on fire.
I mean, literal flames shooting out of my head.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's really--
Whatever. You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you later.
I mean, she's that good.
I am gonna kill the boards.
I am gonna make the boards my bitch.
Yeah, boards, bitch, got it.
Because I--
What are we doing?
Nothing.
But why seek a second opinion
when you know that you're right?
You look weird. Why do you look so weird?
I do not look weird. You were...
talking about...
uh, the boards.
I was talking about what a good teacher Callie is,
and you weren't listening.
No, I-I was listening.
What did I say?
'cause if we're honest with ourselves...
Cristina?
Surgeons are more like cowboys.
Your hair is fire, Callie is that good,
the boards are your bitch.
I-I gotta go.
We're more likely to go it alone.
The boards are my bitch.
Hey. Guess what.
I'm on Peds today. Babies. Yay.
The NICU, not the nursery.
It can get pretty intense.
Oh, well, nothing is as intense
as working on Derek's lost causes.
It's like a death march up there.
I mean, I call time of death on a daily basis.
What do we got today?
Well, you ever seen a baby
that weighs less than a pound?
Uh, no, because babies that weigh less than 16 ounces...
don't survive.
My God.
He's the size of a soda can.
14 ounces.
But he's growing.
That might just be bloating from the fluids.
Well, let's take a look.
How you feeling, Morgan?
I--I'm the least of my worries.
You must be Chris.
Cardio resident at Cleveland, right?
You talk about me?
You don't talk about me?
Oh, you guys haven't had any time
to pick out a name yet, huh?
No, we, uh...
Yeah, we--we should do that.
Any thoughts?
We probably should wait a few weeks, don't you think,
until he can see and hear and breathe on his own?
14.3 ounces today.
I told you he was bigger.
Let's see how that changes his outcome predictor.
Outcome predictor?
Yeah, it's a formula for micro preemies
that determines their chances of survival.
We don't use it here.
Why?
Nope.
Chance of survival--
still a whopping 13%.
That's why. It freaks parents out.
Morning.
Dr. Robbins,
14.3 today.
Well, at least that's headed in the right direction.
On the other hand, uh, we got the X-rays back,
and he's developed NEC.
His bowels are rotting,
and unless we get in there and fix it--
The mortality rate of that surgery is over 50%
in a preemie this size.
Survival rate for treating nec surgically
has gotten way better.
Guys, hold on. Listen,
you've got plenty of decisions to debate down the line,
too many.
All right? This one's a no-brainer.
You don't operate, he's gonna die. Simple as that.
Dr. Karev is right.
Well, I guess we have no choice.
I will see you at lunch, all right?
Oh, Dr. Bailey, is the dumbbell tumor still on the books?
Yes, all good to...
Is Meredith out sick today or...
She came in early to study with Torres. Why?
Um, no, no reason.
It's just that she usually...
drops Zola off.
So...
Um, I'll see you up there.
Okay.
Say good-bye...
So if you could take a look again at chart 9-C,
you will see the potential effect
that, uh, uh... I'm sorry.
Uh, it's not 9-C.
Where is it?
Anyway, um...
As you can see, uh...
it's--it's really cool.
I, uh, just, uh, need a minute to find it.
I have 3-D models of stem cells
so you can see them working together
to grow a heart.
I just need a second to find it.
No problem.
Dr. Altman, we have your material.
It should be enough to go on.
Oh, okay.
Uh, well, um...
Just please remember that this research can save
tens of thousands of lives,
so, um...
please consider it carefully.
What do we got?
Espresso machine exploded
at a coffeehouse on Roosevelt.
Got a 24-year-old female
with second-degree burns on her chest, neck, and face.
Oh, God. Is my face melted?
Is that a large-bore I.V.?
I.V.'s in the left arm.
That's not what I asked you.
You should've put in a large-bore I.V.
It's a 20 gauge. Do you want me to--
I'll do it myself since I want it done right.
What's your name?
Angie. Is my face melted?
No, Angie. Try and relax. Get a burn kit.
37-year-old male, hypotensive in the field,
resolved with fluids.
Open proximal humerus fracture
and multiple lacerations and abrasions.
An espresso machine did this?
Blew him clear across the shop and into some shelves.
And the parts that didn't hit him went through the wall
and into the next store.
Okay, let's page, uh, Dr. Torres and Dr. Hunt.
All right. He's got shrapnel in his chest. Let's page cardio.
Angie. Is Angie okay?
Who's Angie? Is that your wife?
My barista.
Adele?
Adele!
Oh, God.
Adele.
Are you okay, honey?
It was a fiasco.
Oh, it couldn't have been that bad.
It was precisely that bad.
No, but it's stem cells. It's the future.
I mean, they know that.
No, it's dead, just like my husband,
who is also dead.
There's a theme here. Are you noticing?
Teddy--
Whatever. I don't care.
The nice part about having a dead husband
is that you stop caring about anything at all.
You should ask Owen to put in a good word.
The chief of surgery
can have a lot of pull in the decisions.
I don't talk to Owen Hunt.
Out of the way, Grey. I need to get in there.
We've got a white out on the right. Yang, chest tube.
Sure.
Rough night last night?
Hmm?
You didn't come home.
Oh, yeah. Uh, M.V.C.
I texted, but, uh, you must have been asleep.
Okay, Devin, we are gonna give you some pain meds.
And we're gonna put a tube in your chest
that will drain the blood,
and you will start to feel a lot better.
I just ran into Teddy.
She said that she blew her pitch to the board this morning.
It might be nice if you backed her up, you know?
Put in a good word.
Pulse is faint on the left. I need a C.T. angio.
Okay, Devin, once we get this tube in,
we're gonna take you to CT.
Do you have any family we need to contact?
My parents are old. I don't want to worry them.
If you could just let Angie know I'm okay.
She's probably worried.
I'm sorry. Who's Angie?
Uh, the burned barista in Trauma One.
Dr. Grey, dr. Webber's in the E.R.
Yeah?
No, he's in the E.R.
I-I checked the over pressure valve.
I-it was fine.
Or was that yesterday?
Oh, God, is this my fault?
Did I melt my own face off?
Nothing's been melted off. Try to stay still, please.
I mean, they can't expect me to monitor the machine
and handle the morning rush, right?
I really need you to stay still.
I mean, it's too much pressure, this job.
Not enough pay and way too much pressure.
I mean, you guys have no idea.
We're fixing your face. That is pressure.
Now if you could do us both a favor and--
Dr. Avery, go get us some more bandages.
Now.
Sorry about that.
You continue to clean here. I'll be back in a second.
Okay, doctor.
You yelled at a patient and a paramedic,
two people you do not want to piss off.
What's your problem?
I'm sorry, all right?
I've just been so tense. I'm studying for the boards.
We've been studying. You'll do fine.
I can't do fine. I have to do great. I'm an Avery.
Are you getting any...
Did you just ask me if I'm getting any?
When was the last time?
That's none of your business.
Just tell me.
I won't judge.
I am focused. There's no time.
There's always time.
My mother used to have trouble with the stove, too,
and then she started getting lost driving,
and then she started leaving the house
in the middle of the night.
Adele's fine.
And we're-- we're managing.
Rose Ridge is top-notch--
Great doctors, great facility.
Yeah, I know, I know. We're just not there yet.
Any deeper,
and this burn could've retired you from surgery.
Yeah, I'll-- I'll look into it.
You're just trying to shut me up.
Yeah, how am I doing?
I don't have pull many places,
but I'm kind of a big deal there.
So if you need me to make a call for you, I can.
Good. Only a little of the bowel is necrotic.
There should be more than enough to salvage.
Maybe his dad should factor spunk
into his stupid algorithm.
He's a fourth year. He knows just enough to be annoying.
Well, he's acting like the baby is already dead.
But look at him. He's a champ.
You're like a little Muhammad Ali, aren't you?
Someone's peppy.
She's on a vacation from lost-cause brain surgeries.
She needs to have some fun today.
You know what's really fun?
Removing dead bowel. You want to make the cut?
Really? Are--are-- are you sure?
Yeah. Get over there before I change my mind.
Okay, the tissue rips really easily,
so only press down as hard as you would need to cut a hair.
So Torres and I assessed his shoulder,
and I mean, wow.
So we both agreed--
Yeah, let's just do this. Uh, sir.
We're gonna take a scan of your chest and your arms. Here you go.
So just try and relax.
My friend Angie, is...is she okay?
She's got some bad burns, but she'll be fine.
It's my fault for going in during the rush.
She gets too flustered around me.
And the sexual tension's been building for months.
You know, a look here, a smile there.
It can be hard to focus
with all those pheromones buzzing around you.
I should've known it's become dangerous.
Okay, well, let's get you and your pheromones into the scan.
Yeah, lately, she's been taking it to another level,
adding these foam leaf designs on top of my coffee...
Handmade, just for me.
It'd be great if I could send Angie
a cappuccino or something.
Let her know I'm doing okay.
Nicely done.
So now what?
Even if he stabilizes,
he's looking at years of procedures and surgeries.
His parents are residents.
They can't both quit,
and medical care for a little guy like this is expensive.
You really know how to take the fun out of a party,
you know that?
Damn. Looks like he's in cardiogenic shock.
Push epi and atropine.
D-did I--
No, no, no, no. You did just fine. It's just that--
He's bradied down to 52.
Grey, start C.P.R.
His heart hasn't stopped.
With preemies, we start C.P.R.
when the heart rate goes below 60.
Now use two fingers, light pressure. Go.
We get seven major newspapers here every day,
as well as live readings from local authors.
Oh, look, Adele, a mystery section.
She loves mysteries, don't you, honey?
Our librarian reads a chapter every day after dinner.
Actually, we're just finishing <i>Death on the Nile,</i>
so if you know who done it, keep it to yourselves.
Should we check out the gymnasium?
We just added a piloxing class.
Every room is different,
but they all have their own instant call button for attendants,
your own bathroom, and a nice view of the grounds.
I'll leave you two alone
so you can look the place over on your own.
If you have any questions, I'll be at the front desk.
What do you think, Adele?
It's nice.
But it's too small for us.
You're a doctor.
You said that you could afford a house.
We certainly couldn't possibly start a family here.
Richard,
where would the nursery go?
You're right, honey.
It's too small.
I said I'd get you a house.
Let's go.
I got it.
Got what?
The grant.
$4 million to grow hearts from stem cells.
You got it?
I'm gonna grow hearts. Can you believe it?
Oh, God, Teddy, that's amazing.
I-I must have not done as bad as I thought this morning
unless--or I charmed them with my fumbling desperation.
I-I have no idea. I don't care. I got it.
We were able to cut out most of the necrotic bowel,
but then he went into C.H.F.
Oh, my God.
Morgan, he's 24 weeks old.
Born 16 weeks early.
This shouldn't be a shock. He wasn't ready.
But there are a few things that we can try
to help oxygenate him better.
And then hopefully, he'll get stronger.
We could use liquid ventilation.
Which could cause hypocarbia.
We could put him on a high-frequency oscillator.
Which could cause air trapping.
Or we can put him on ecmo.
Which, uh, just to get ahead of you, Chris,
we don't think he would survive at this stage.
Okay, but before we do anything,
we just need to know how aggressive you want to be.
I think we stop. We stop right now.
There are-- are plenty of options. We...
We should use them.
These are his chances of survival, right here.
This is reality.
Now you're a doctor. Think like one.
If you had a patient with odds like that,
would you operate?
I'm sorry about earlier. The way I --
My behavior was completely unprofessional.
No, I'm sorry.
I was freaking out.
Look at you two, getting along.
You date doctors, Angie?
Do not listen to this man. He thinks I need to be set up.
He does need to be set up.
He's shy, needs a little push.
Devin is heading into surgery.
He wanted me to give you this,
tell you not to worry, etcetera.
So...here.
Devin?
The guy -- guy from the accident.
O-okay. I...
You know, the -- the customer you flirt with every day?
I'm sorry. I have no idea who he is.
Sweet, nerdy type.
You put those foamy leaves
on the top of his coffee?
I-I have to make those leaves for everybody.
It's a new company policy.
I'll take it.
Get your own.
That's not my point.
I can't believe that they're not gonna do anything.
I mean, they are basically
giving this kid a death sentence.
Chris just wants to get back to his residency,
and Morgan is too weak to even think straight.
The parents have made up their minds.
Just let me eat my food in peace.
Ali doesn't even have any parents as far as I can see.
And you know what? She is your intern.
You need to step up.
Give me those. She won't shut up.
No, I'm studying.
Okay, look, all I am saying --
Look, let it go, Lexie.
All I am saying is,
parents did not decide his treatment plan,
doctors did.
Math did.
Get your own.
Hey, so it turns out Devin needs a thoracotomy.
Your surgery.
Remember Devin,
likes coffee, is in love with his barista?
What about me? Remember me?
Have you, uh, hit that?
Which that?
That -- the brown-haired that.
Oh, the that with the brown hair
and the nice ass and the perfect --
Teeth, yes. Have you?
Uh, no. Mnh-mnh. She only goes for the attendings.
Next year.
Good job.
Did you see that?
What?
The way that woman looked at me and Zola.
Derek, we're hot doctors with babies.
Women are gonna stare.
I think she's racist.
Oh, I get it.
You're worried about bridging the cultural divide.
I know all about it.
That's why I learned Spanish.
Es la verdad, si?
Mi senorita chica muchacha yo soy. El papi de tu,
Sofia-rita.
Besome mucho.
You know she doesn't speak Spanish?
Oh, but she shall.
Verdad? Hablas mucho?
You shall.
See? Bridging the divide.
How's it going with your better half?
He's uptight, worried about the boards,
snapping at patients.
I'm trying to get him laid, but --
I'm talking about Julia.
Oh. Of course.
She's, uh...
she's good, thanks. She's doing well.
Good.
Hello.
Hey.
I, uh, I have to listen to his chest.
Hey, Ali. How you doing?
Why do you call him that?
It's, uh, it's for the preemie babies without names
or the ones with weak names, like, uh,
Felix or Claude.
You know, we like to give them fighters' names,
like Boris or Butch or... Molly,
You know, to help them weather the storm.
I like that.
We'll take what we can get.
How are his lungs?
Well, they're still wet, so I may up his lasix.
His pulse ox isn't great either.
Uh, where's Chris?
I don't know.
He keeps saying that he's making calls,
updating his family, but...
I think he just can't be here.
Do you think we're doing the right thing?
Well, as a doctor,
I look at Ali's odds, and I'm not very optimistic.
But...
Hey, I've seen parents who, uh...
They don't think like doctors.
They see things that, uh, we don't.
I'm not gonna tell you what to do,
but I will say this, you-- Ali, he's got a--
He's got plenty of doctors in his corner.
You make sure he's got a parent.
Dr. Karev.
We're, uh, thinking of naming him Thomas,
after my dad.
Is that tough enough?
Tommy? Tommy's good.
You paged?
Uh, yes. When you finish your surgery with Torres,
I need you to check on my post-op patients.
I'm going home.
Something happen?
Uh, Adele's e't having a good day.
Rose Ridge, Richard.
I'm telling you, you really should look into it.
We went to Rose Ridge.
Rose Ridge doesn't have anything that I can't give her.
Rose Ridge is not the answer.
She burned your hand.
You think you can handle this,
but you can't.
I know. I have been through this.
The difference between you and Ellis
and me and Adele, meredith,
I made vows to Adele,
vows to cherish her and be true to her,
in sickness and in health,
vows that I have broken time and again.
The least I could do is honor her in sickness
and give her the home that she deserves
and the best care there is.
She stays home, and if necessary,
so do I.
Did you have any pets growing up?
A f-fish tank, couple of hamsters,
two dogs--why?
I'm just trying to get to know you better. That's it.
Okay.
What were your dogs' names?
Well, let's see. Uh, there was Buster
and, um...
Pickles.
Pickles was a Schnauzer--
What's your mother's maiden name?
Are you hacking me?
I need the nurses' schedule.
I don't schedule the nurses.
If you knew anything about how this hospital was run,
You would know--
you know the nurses' schedule.
You are April Kepner.
You know everything.
Anyone in particular?
Uh, um, Emily someone.
Emily. Let's see.
Ah. She was on days in the C.C.U.,
but then she switched to nights
in the surgical I.C.U. handling traumas,
which is weird,
But Dr. Hunt signed off on it, so it should be fine.
Hey, if I see her crying or bleeding,
I'll come after you...
Hacker.
Iliac artery is mobilized.
Okay. Let me get in there.
You know what might be fun?
I have no idea what might be fun.
A play date with Zola and Tuck.
Oh. Uh...
Well, Tuck's 5,
and Zola's, what, 1?
1 and a quarter.
But it's more like she's 3. She's very mature.
Playing for Tuck means throwing things,
breaking things, um,
shooting things at people and things.
I don't think Zola would survive a play date with Tuck.
Yeah. It's probably not a good idea.
Forceps, please.
The-there's gotta be some kids down in day care
closer to her age,
even if they aren't as advanced.
I just--I don't want her to feel out of place.
It might be nice if she could hang out with...
Kids who...
Have the same, uh,
same... roots.
Roots?
You know...
Okay, let's just resect the tumor.
The oscillator isn't the answer.
Then liquid ventilation.
I-it could improve his lung function. Morgan.
You--you are his dad, not his doctor.
You can't just give up.
It's not about giving up.
He's still alive.
It's about doing more harm than good.
How is letting him die good, Chris, how?
I know you.
Deep down, we're both thinking the exact same thing.
Tell me what we're thinking, Chris.
We're thinking that getting pregnant was an accident,
that this baby
should not be alive right now,
that its chances of survival
or having any kind of life worth living are slim to none,
that doing every damn thing we can to keep it alive
is just so that we can feel good about ourselves after he dies.
Now can you admit any of that?
Just go.
You can't cut me out of these decisions.
I'm not cutting you out.
I'm offering you an out.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, take the out, Chris,
because maybe you can't admit it now
in the light of day,
but you want it.
How are you doing on your end, Torres?
How are we doing, Grey?
Uh, good.
I'm just finishing up this arterial repair,
and then I'm gonna put in the rod.
It's bad enough the girl he loves has no idea he exists.
Now the T.S.A. is gonna hassle him for the rest of his life.
Burned barista doesn't know who he is?
Nope. Never even heard of him.
Where are we?
Dr. Altman?
He's fine. Shrapnel's out.
Good.
Did you all hear that, uh, Dr. Altman
got a huge grant for her stem cell research?
I did. Congratulations, Dr. Altman.
Thank you.
I hear that, uh, Dr. Silverman at Wake Forest
has been doing great work in stem cells.
Maybe you should give her a call--
If I wanted your advice on my specialty, Dr. Hunt,
I'll ask.
Once Teddy's done with the lung, you can get at the other arm
to get out the remaining shrapnel.
All right. Okay.
Here. I'll help you finish.
I've got it.
No, no, it'd be easier--
I said I've got it. Now back the hell off.
You're an attractive woman.
Who? Uh, me?
You and Avery spend a lot of time together, don't you?
We do, yes.
Uh, but we're just study buddies.
I mean, we're not, you know...
He's an attractive guy, nice bone structure,
hypnotic eyes, etcetera.
I guess so?
Have you noticed how uptight he's been lately?
Uh, l-like I said, we're study buddies, so...
Study buddies should help each other out,
relieve some of that stress.
Maybe extend that buddy relationship.
Extend? Um... I-I don't--
You're two attractive people.
Any thoughts on how to alleviate that stress?
We could--we could go for more walks?
Walks are good.
Walks are nice.
I was thinking, since you're already study buddies,
you could extend that relationship...
become the other kind of buddies.
Are you--are--
I am.
Dr. Sloan--
Everybody wins.
Th-this is sexual harassment. You know that, right?
I think of it as sexual encouragement.
Think about it, Kepner.
Take one for the team.
You got her the grant money.
Look, I know you did. You have to tell her.
It'll help things between you guys.
No, it won't.
All right, then I'll tell her.
No, you won't.
You can't let her treat you this way.
When Henry died,
you were just doing your job.
You're not a bad guy.
How do you know?
Look, sometimes, you just lash out.
It might not be rational or fair,
but you do it 'cause you have to.
If she needs me for that,
if she needs a punching bag,
a bad guy to point the finger at
and help her cope,
then let that be me.
Fine, you can be a martyr,
but you still have to be the chief.
And what happened in that O.R. today,
that should never happen again.
We were able to repair your lung and fix your shoulder,
but you're gonna need months of rehab.
How are you feeling?
Like I got hit by a dump truck.
Yeah, it's gonna feel like that for a little while.
But don't be afraid to use, uh,
your P.C.A. pump for, uh, pain meds.
So has Angie come by the room?
I didn't miss her, did I?
Angie has no idea who you are.
What?
That's--that's ridiculous.
She... she knows my order.
I don't even have to say it.
That's her job.
The accident...
She's confused.
She knows me.
We have this thing,
this flirtation.
What did she say?
Tell me exactly what she said.
That she doesn't have any idea
who you are.
That's exactly what she said.
You've made up this whole thing in your head.
No. You don't understand.
I do.
It happens.
I mean, you see one thing
and you think it means something that it doesn't,
and pretty soon, you're acting like it's real.
You have to stop.
You have to just...
stop.
This should improve his cardiovascular
and pulmonary status, right?
That's the plan.
When will we know if it's working?
In a couple of hours.
But you should go rest. We'll update you.
Chris left. I'm all he has now.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, it's better if you go rest.
It can be hard for parents to watch.
I appreciate the concern, but I'm a doctor, too.
Let's do this.
Oh, God.
What's up?
Hi.
You paged?
I-I wanted...
to, um...
What?
Hey, what are you doing? Cristina--
No, you can spare-- spare 15 minutes.
I don't have time.
No, I'm working in the E.R.
No, we'll be quick.
I don't...
So fast.
Have time.
So fast.
Cristina, I don't--
So, so fast.
Damn it. Damn it. I don't have time.
Owen...
Mrs. Webber--
Get back.
Adele?
Put that down!
Get out!
Sweetheart!
Adele!
Get out of my house
right now!
Make her stop!
Adele!
Listen to me. I'm here.
Get away from me!
Look at me, honey.
I'm calling the police!
Adele, it's me, your husband--Richard.
Get back!
It's me--Richard.
Oh, don't hurt me.
Look, I'm your husband-- Richard.
Please go.
Please leave.
My parents will be here.
They'll be home any minute.
It's me, Adele, your husband.
I'm your husband.
I'm your husband! I'm your husband!
How's he doing?
Ah, he's holding steady for now,
but we won't know anything for a few more hours.
I had to know before I left.
Sure.
I'd stay, I would.
I would, but I-I've got people working doubles
covering my shifts,
and--and we're in the middle of a clinical trial right now,
and... you know how it is, right?
Thank you.
Do you have a problem?
Excuse me?
Oh, no.
It is 2012. You want to be shocked
by the sight of a white man with a black baby...
you're about three decades too late!
I'm sorry. Don't listen to him.
What--what is wrong--
She's unbelievable.
She was not staring at you
because daddy's white and his daughter is black.
She was staring at you two
because daddy has nice hair,
maybe perfect hair, but for whatever reason,
his daughter's hair is 31 flavors of wrong.
It's hard on the eyes.
Look, you are white,
but your daughter is black.
Do your baby's hair!
Here you go.
Thanks.
What are you doing?
Stop it.
Ow!
What's the plan?
You have bony, sharp fingers.
What plan? There's no plan.
Your plan, which makes it our plan.
Whatever it is, I need to know.
Are you plotting a murder, a nuclear attack?
It's fine. I'll get on board.
I'm sure you have a good reason.
But just let me know.
You're starting to freak me out.
I think Owen is cheating on me.
Did you see something?
No.
Did someone else see something?
No.
Did he do something?
No.
Well, then how do you know--
I don't know. I don't know! I just...
know.
Cristina--
You know what? I am--
I'm being--I'm being crazy. I'm crazy, right?
This is totally...
I'm crazy.
I'm just...
We're having a hard time, and I'm--I'm--
I'm making it into... I'm crazy.
I'm--I'm--
I'm--I'm crazy.
Okay.
I really think he's not cheating.
I know that.
Julia has a friend.
She's pretty.
Uh, a little brooding and tattoo-y for my taste,
but... pretty.
Bet you're into that sort of thing, huh?
For the last time, I do not need a girlfriend.
Who said anything about girlfriend?
One double date.
Help me out with a third-wheel situation.
So, so tempting, but no, thank you.
All right.
But you need to get out there, man.
Doing yourself a huge disservice.
I had a girlfriend, all right?
Now I just can't.
I don't want to.
What do you mean, you can't?
You still love her.
You still love Lexie.
See you tomorrow.
I can't wait to get back to neuro.
At least with lost causes,
you know where you stand,
and the patients can tell you when they have had enough.
I don't know how Morgan can bear it.
I...
I don't know how any of you can.
Come here.
Jolene Jordamo,
1 pound, 4 ounces at birth.
She's 12 years old now.
She's a goalie.
Benji Gellerman,
1 pound, 2 ounces at birth.
He's 9 years old, plays the trumpet.
This one, Hannah Slavin? I worked on her myself.
She looked like a hamster when she came out.
Her dad just called,
said she took her first steps.
Some of them survive.
What happened?
Did you have an accident?
Richard, your hand,
did you hurt your hand?
I'm--I'm--I'm fine. I'm fine.
Did I hurt your hand?
You know, how--how about some dinner?
I'll--I'll heat up the lasagna.
I have Alzheimer's...
don't I?
Yes, sweetheart.
You do.
Rose Ridge, it--
It seemed like a nice place.
We went there this morning, didn't we?
Yes, we did.
I think it's best...
if I were to go live there.
You--you don't-- you don't have to do that.
I mean, you-- you can stay here.
I like having you here.
I liked it there.
Your home is here with me.
I'd rather be there.
Okay, sweetheart.
Okay.
You can seek the advice of others...
Is that right? Am I stroking--
and I pull it up?
Surround yourself with trusted advisors.
There you go.
Like that?
Gather--yep. Gather, good.
Hey, Meredith.
Did you know Zola has... a kitchen?
Yes, Derek.
I know all about Zola's kitchen.
Now I want-- do I turn it?
Gather everything in. Pull the kitchen up.
Pull the kitchen up.
But in the end, the decision is always yours...
and yours alone.
And when it's time to act, and you're all alone
with your back against the wall...
The only voice that matters is the one in your head...
Cristina?
The one telling you what you probably already knew...
