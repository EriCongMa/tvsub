When you're a kid,
you always want things to stay the same--
the same teacher, same house,
same friends.
Being a surgeon is no different.
You get used to the same attendings,
same scrub nurses, same hospital.
Hey, Cristina.
Of course, that all changes
the minute fifth year comes around...
Cristina!
Hey!
Hey.
And you have to find a new job.
Uh, how was Dallas?
Ugh. Bad.
I can operate circles around the head of the program.
I'm sick of all this schlepping.
From now on, they're gonna have to come to me.
How was yours? Boston, right?
Uh, San Francisco.
I'm supposed to leave for Boston tonight,
but I think I'm gonna cancel.
What? Only an idiot cancels the Brigham.
And didn't Bailey set that up for you?
She's gonna kill you.
How cute is she?
Hi!
Hey, do you need a ride, or is Owen, um...
Picking me up? No.
So how'd it go?
It was great. Hi, baby girl.
Oh, my love.
Look who's here.
Mama. She missed you.
Uh, your idiot wife wants to cancel her interview
at the Brigham.
Hi, baby girl.
No. You don't cancel an interview
with the best general surgery
program in the country.
Uh-huh. What I said.
Why would we move?
You've almost finished the house,
and you have a job here.
There are other homes and jobs in Boston.
You're going. End of discussion.
Good husband.
Okay, let's go.
I will ride in the back with my girl.
I'll get the bags.
Here we go.
I snagged the last croissant,
and I only had to elbow one orderly out of the way to get it.
I got a secret.
Oh, really?
If I tell you, you can't tell anybody.
You promise?
I promise.
I'm in love.
With, uh...
with whom?
Oh, this is getting ridiculous.
The N.I.H.?
Since when does the N.I.H.
bribe residents to come work for them?
Oh, they don't,
except when you're me-- a god.
Hey.
Cookie's stale.
Aw, Karev.
Is this hard for you,
having to beg for interviews while some of us
just sit back and get wooed?
No one is begging.
Oh, yeah, maybe you should. Maybe that way,
you'd actually get an interview.
Ha! I love mean Kepner.
I got an interview.
Oh, really, where?
At...
places.
Whatever! Look, this sucks, okay.
I mean, we got boards in a couple of weeks
and--and now they want us to go on freakin' job interviews?
There's only so much crap a guy can have thrown at him
before he snaps.
There's a trauma coming in on the roof.
Kepner, Karev, come with me.
I gotta leave for my Northwestern interview in an hour.
I told you yesterday.
Um, Avery?
Sloan's got me all day, chief. Sorry.
I'm free.
Great. Thank you.
Female hiker found at the bottom of a ravine.
Positive L.O.C. with obvious head and abdominal trauma,
hypothermia, frostbite, you name it.
Let's go.
Airway looks clear. Weakened pulse.
I'm Dr. Grey. You're in the hospital.
Can you tell us your name?
Okay, okay.
Let's go.
Outta the way.
Okay, I'm gonna be right on the other side of that glass.
You just try to stay calm.
You weren't hiking out there, were you?
What's the holdup, Grey?
I'm staying in. Get me an apron.
Okay. Here you go.
Okay, I'm gonna stay with you.
I'm not leaving. I'll be right here the whole time.
Displaced tibial fracture.
Rib fractures, too. Lungs look fine.
How far did she fall?
Ah, don't know. Some hikers found her.
What is it, Karev?
Uh, Jane Doe,
looks to be around 15 years old.
Hunt wants you to take a look at her.
Hey, any word back on my interviews?
Uh, yeah, I'm working on it.
The angle's off on this elbow.
You've been working on it for a couple of weeks now.
Well, you're an acquired taste,
like blue cheese. Some people love it
and some people can't stand to be in the same room with it.
They think it's stinky.
So now I'm stinky cheese?
Uh, you can tell Hunt this isn't a peds case.
She's an adult. The growth plates have closed.
And tell him this elbow was broken a while ago.
See the curve in her forearm
and the periosteal reaction on her humerus?
These are fractures that never healed right.
Or were never treated.
I've seen injuries like this in Iraq
in patients who were tortured.
She was abused. It's all over the X-rays.
Okay, we have to call the police.
Just stay calm.
We don't know anything for sure until she talks.
Hunt, she has a temporal bone fracture.
I'm gonna have to do a middle fossa approach.
There's an aneurysm in her celiac artery.
I'll need to put a graft in.
She's ready to be put under, chief.
Wait.
You were running from someone, right?
Is that how you fell? No one's gonna hurt you.
We just need to know your name.
He--he called me "Susan."
But I-I think it's "Holly."
Beneath the purple tab you'll find case studies
from the past year.
Under the yellow tab, a list of programs
instituted during my tenure as chief resident.
Under the green tab--
"Dr. Kepner's cheerful demeanor
and pleasant bedside manner
made my recovery period a true pleasure."
Letters from former patients.
This one's... five pages.
Just one of many satisfied customers.
Okay, moving on to the blue tab--
Awards and accolades.
Yes, her name was Holly Wheeler.
We don't know anything yet.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
It was all over the news.
She was in the grocery store with her mom,
and somebody just... took her.
It was the summer of... 2000.
So this could be her.
I mean, what, she was probably
8 or 9 at the time?
She was 6, and they weren't in the supermarket,
they were outside.
Her mom bumped into a friend,
started talking about the block party they were having that weekend.
Uh, could she bring a salad?
They had enough dessert already.
I mean, that's how long it took for her to realize
that her child wasn't there anymore.
That story runs through my head
every time Tuck walks out the door.
And--and yeah, we don't know if this is her,
so please let's just stop talking about it and operate.
Bailey, Shepherd, can you stop for a moment?
What is it?
The police want us to check for a birthmark under her arm.
The other side, further up.
Delivery for Dr. Yang.
Thank you.
That's not for you.
Call a cop. There's one over there.
Who's on my jock now?
Cleveland Clinic. Pretty impressive.
I'm not gonna grovel.
You know we're as good a program as Cleveland Clinic.
And we've got a major stem cell project,
one that I welcome your input on.
And as far as teachers,
I'm a catch.
And I'm groveling.
It's sweet.
Come on. Let's go.
Okay. Can you wiggle your toes?
Painful?
Yeah. You hit your head pretty hard when you fell.
But you're doing great, okay?
Holly, I'm Dr. Fincher.
I'm a therapist who works for the hospital.
Is it okay if the police ask you a few questions?
Only if you feel up to it.
Do you know his name, Holly, the man that was keeping you?
It's okay.
Joseph.
Joseph Ingles.
That's great. Really helpful.
Now can you tell us anything about where you were living?
Was it a house, an apartment?
It was a house.
One story. It has a basement.
Do you know if there was any roads nearby?
Could you hear cars?
He didn't let me go outside.
Holly, we can stop if you need to.
Just let us know.
Okay, then. Maybe we should--
we should take a break. Sure.
You should've called me the minute you talked to the police.
She had major brain and abdominal injuries.
My first concern was keeping her alive.
I understand, but the protocol is to call psych right away.
You didn't,
and now our patient has bonded with a surgeon.
Her name is Dr. Grey.
Dr. Grey. Fine. That's who Holly has chosen.
There's no breaking that bond now.
What's going on?
Dr. Fincher thinks that it's best that you stay with Holly,
at least until her parents arrive.
I have no psych training.
Holly spent the last 12 years
with little to no control over anything in her life.
Our job is to break that pattern by letting her know that
she and she alone is in control here.
Whatever she wants, she gets,
including you.
We'll have to work together on this.
Okay.
Thank you. If you'll excuse me,
the family's waiting for my call.
What was I supposed to say,
I'm flattered that she likes me,
but I have a really important job interview?
I just wanted to ask you,
did you need me to reschedule your flight?
Yes, I can take the last flight out tonight
and get a cab from here.
Okay.
Hang in there.
Tough case.
You're doing a good job.
Except that I'm not.
Her parents are on their way,
and the press are filling up the parking lot.
I think I might be out of my depth here.
I'll deal with the parents.
You call Phil in security
and have him double the guard presence,
then call Heather in P.R.
and tell her to wrangle the press.
You go home, make sure all your suits are clean.
You'll need 'em for the press conferences.
You'll be okay, Hunt.
What is she like?
Did she speak English?
Or is it like that Jodie-Foster-in-the-woods movie?
English, although she's not really speaking.
She was just flipping through the channels.
I'm guessing the TV reception in the basement wasn't that great.
Are you trying to get out of your interview?
The parents are on their way.
I'm going. I want to.
Really?
'Cause it seems like you want to stay and raise...
happy cutie babies
with your happy cutie husband.
Why are you so fine with leaving?
Because I'm a surgeon,
and I want to work at the best hospital
with the best people,
as should you.
Since when did you turn into such a sap?
What do you guys know about Carson Methodist?
Nothing. I'd like to keep it that way.
It's in Toledo. Or an hour outside, I guess.
I interview next week.
Where's Toledo?
Canada.
Ohio. A quarter of a million people live there.
But this is an hour outside.
Robbins set it up for me. I-I can't not go.
I've enjoyed our time together these past few years.
What are you doing?
We are officially on different career paths.
It's only polite to say good-bye.
Oh, my God. Holly?
It's her.
It's her.
I'd know you anywhere. You are...
still my perfect baby girl.
Holly, I know it's soon, but...
I would like to hug you.
Would that be okay?
Oh, my baby girl.
My baby girl.
Baby girl.
We're a new program,
so you're on the verge of something great here.
You're lucky you're getting in now.
Really?
Oh, yeah. We're even about to upgrade our NICU.
Just waiting on the final round of funding.
In fact, that's why we were so excited to get Dr. Robbins' call.
She told us all about that money
you raised for those African kids.
Melinda, these are the discharge papers
for the liver transplant boy.
Could you prep 'em for transport?
You're discharging a liver transplant?
We're not equipped to deal with cases that serious yet.
So we're shipping him to our sister hospital in Toledo.
You hungry?
It's make-your-own-sundae day at the cafeteria.
You're gonna love it.
Oh, hey. Sorry.
Uh, uh, I thought you were...
I thought you were the kidnapper.
No, no, I--you hear they caught him last night?
Uh, yeah.
That's why I'm here, actually. I needed more suits,
you know, for the press conferences.
I-I thought you were studying at Meredith's.
Well, I came home to take a shower.
Well, I'll... clear up and I'll get out of your hair.
Okay.
You know, just leave it.
Stay here.
Oh, no, no, no, I--
No, I'm staying at Meredith's until the boards.
I'm never here. So just stay.
You sure?
Until the boards are over.
Okay.
I'll, um... I'll go now.
Give you some privacy.
This is, I think,
your first day of school.
6th birthday.
Looks like that's where the bunny came from.
So today Dr. Torres will be realigning your arm.
You'll have a lot more mobility in your elbows.
Did they really think that this would work?
Give me some photo albums and a stuffed animal,
and we'd be normal again?
No, I think that they are just trying to help you remember
because you were only 6.
Well, then tell them that I remember all of it,
the first day of school and my 6th birthday,
just like I remember
the first time he made me take my clothes off
and how hard he kicked me
when I didn't act like I liked it
or how his breath smelled like cigarettes,
how I could've gotten away a bunch of times,
but every time I made it outside,
I could hear his voice inside my head...
that they didn't want me,
that I was dead to them.
And that the only reason I finally ran away
was because he told me
that he was gonna take another girl...
because I was too old and used up
and disgusting now.
Tell them that.
We will then repair,
uh, numerous fractures that never healed properly the first time.
The patient is in good spirits,
and we're grateful for the chance to allow her
to heal in a way that wasn't positive--
pausible--possible before.
We hope--
Uh, thank you, Dr. Torres.
Excuse me! What about her--
How does Holly feel about Joseph being captured?
And her parents-- when can we talk to them?
Look, I'm sure the Wheelers would appreciate some privacy--
Is it true Holly's refusing to speak to them?
Where are her parents?
It's a very complicated situation.
It's not complicated.
It's not complicated at all.
Frank.
The guy's a monster who stole our kid for 12 years,
and we're the ones who are allowed to see her
for only one supervised hour a day.
Holly's in a fragile state.
She'll need all of us to abide by her wishes,
even if that means giving her space.
She was brainwashed by him.
She doesn't know what she wants.
Possibly,
but she still has feelings of blame and resentment
that she has to process.
Right now you're still strangers to her.
'Cause you won't let us go in there and be her parents!
Did you show her the photo album?
Did she remember?
Not even the bunny? She loved that thing.
She didn't remember.
I'm sorry.
She'll come back to you.
It might take some time,
but the memories are still there.
You just have to be patient.
Oh, hey, Chief.
Um, I haven't heard back yet from Northwestern,
and I know you're close with Dr. Mitchell.
Have you, uh, have you spoken to him?
Uh, yes, he said your resume was impressive.
Oh, thank goodness.
Keep your options open, though.
What do you mean? He said he thought I was impressive.
He also said he wasn't sure
if it was a match personality-wise.
Personality? I'm-- I'm asking for a job,
not a date to the prom.
Damn reporters.
Sorry. Hello.
Chisel, please.
Man, look at all this callus formation.
He would've had to break this arm three or four times
to get this amount of scar tissue.
And the humerus is pretty strong, even in a young kid.
Kinda makes you sick
just thinking about the amount of...
force it took to break it--
Can we talk about something else?
I mean, you know, who knows what they hear subconsciously?
So it...
Maybe it wouldn't hurt to come up with a conversation
about something other than every parent's worst nightmare.
Avery scored an interview at U.C.L.A.
That is not what she meant.
No, that--that's good. Let's hear about that.
Well, it's a top-10 program, which is impressive.
Of course, it's just as much a reflection
on me as a teacher as it is his surgical skill.
Okay.
Hey. How was Canada?
Ugh. Canada would've been better than that dump.
You want me to call the chief at Duke?
He wants me so bad, he'll do anything I tell him,
even accept you.
Drill, please.
What's Hunt gonna do anyway if you leave?
Oh, that's right.
You say "Duke," and he's on the next plane.
Guy's so whipped.
She's not going to Duke,
and neither are you.
This is a great program,
and we'd be crazy to leave.
That's because you want to play shrink to your patient
for the rest of your life.
She imprinted on me. What am I supposed to do?
How's she doing anyway?
Great. I mean, better.
I found two granola bars under her bed this morning.
But at least she didn't lie about where they came from.
Fincher says she's talking more in therapy,
athough she's not talking to Frank and Kathleen.
She was being kept 5 miles away from their house,
and they didn't find her.
You don't just get over something like that.
Maybe she could move in with you
when we all leave.
Adele, baby.
Are you ready for dinner?
Aah! This is a private room!
Get out!
You get that man out of here!
Dr. Webber--
It's assault. She was vulnerable.
You just don't let a man--
Please, sir--
He took advantage of my wife.
He's a predator.
If you don't get him out, I will sue.
Dr. Webber, Allan has Alzheimer's.
His is quite progressed,
further along than your wife's, even.
He's not a predator.
He's a patient here.
You know, I don't have to tell you
That Columbia has a cutting-edge cardio program.
So I hope the fact that I've flown cross country
to come knocking on your door
shows you just how serious we are about --
Can you pass me the butter?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You should come to New York to visit.
You like theater?
I can get you tickets to any musical you'd like.
Oh, I hate musicals.
I do like wine, though.
Waiter.
More wine.
Coming.
There's an old fracture in your pelvis
that Dr. Torres is concerned about.
It's called an avulsion fracture.
At first I thought it might have happened when you ran away,
but this injury is a lot older than that.
Do you remember when the pain first started
or anything that might've happened right before that,
a...a fall, maybe?
No, I-I-I don't.
Maybe it happened after I had the baby.
It was a few years ago.
I-I think it died.
I couldn't walk for a long time after. I-I...
It must have happened then, right?
Uh...that's...
Yes, that's...
I'm sorry.
I didn't -- - No.
Should -- - No. It's --
Should I not have said anything?
Excuse me.
It's okay.
Sorry I'm late.
No, it's been a while since you've been in my O.R.
I'm honored you showed up.
Has Grey been ditching you, too, for interviews?
Cristina has been so distracted.
Meredith, do you know who she's talking to today?
Stanford, I think.
Stanford? Wh --
Since when has she been interested in Stanford?
You blame her?
You'd be a fool not to pursue cardio at Stanford.
Kinda like...general at the Brigham.
I told you, the program director
was very understanding when I called.
And you believed her after canceling three times?
You know how many strings I had to pull to get you in there?
Well, the chief assigned this case to me.
What am I supposed to do?
Stanford? I mean, that is just -- that's far.
Hunt is really okay with that?
Grey, will you, uh, tie these vessels off?
She's been through enough.
She doesn't need to worry about some jerk
taking her picture in the hall.
I am so sorry.
Well, don't be, just...
help me, okay?
Help me keep her safe.
It won't happen again.
Hey, um, Teddy needed you to sign off
on the stem cell paperwork.
Okay.
People have cameras on their phones.
He can't expect you to ban phones from the hospital.
No, no, but I can make sure that the hallways are clear
before they move her, or security keeps a lookout.
I'm...I'm not thinking.
I'm making mistakes...
in over my head.
I wasn't supposed to be the chief.
I wasn't supposed to be this...guy. I'm...
I mean, how am I the guy
that ends up making this man's daughter more hurt
than she already is?
I'm just -- I'm failing. I'm...
You're doing the best you can.
And how was your day,
my little scootchie coo?
Did you just have so much fun playing with Zola?
You know, she doesn't understand you any better
the more idiotic you sound.
Hey, Zola. Good evening.
Good evening. How are you?
Tuck?
Tucker?
Hey, don't be shy.
Hey, uh, where's Tuck?
I'm not sure. He was...just here.
You don't know?
You know it's your job to know where my son is?
Tara, when's the last time you saw him?
A few minutes ago. I swear, he was right here.
A few...
Try it again.
Wh --
Um, call, a-a code pink.
Right now.
What? No, there's a protocol for a code --
Hey, hey, my son is missing. Okay? He's gone.
You took your eyes off of him, and he's gone.
Now you pick up that phone,
and you make that call right now,
or I swear to god, I will have your throat.
Tara, just do it.
Just call the code pink!
I'll look for him.
Yes, we have a code pink.
A 5-year-old boy, missing I -- I'm not sure how long.
Um, I don't know.
He's wearing a green-striped...
Please don't just stand there.
Okay? Look. Help me find him. Oh, God.
He's probably screaming 'cause he knows to scream
if there's a-a stranger.
Just...oh, God. He's screaming.
He's scream...
Dr. Bailey.
What?
He had a nosebleed.
I-I took him to the nurse.
What?
What? There you are!
Come here. Let me see. Is that...
Let me see that tissue.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, well, then I guess, um...
Yes, you can cancel...
Where was he?
We're gonna have to go...
Nosebleed.
get you an ice cream.
Yeah? Yeah? Well, let's go home.
And, uh, let's, uh, get some ice cream.
Here. Come on, sweetheart.
Oh, I can't believe you had a nosebleed.
And...
that should just about do it.
加州大学洛杉矶分校
Impressive.
Most of our candidates can't get the detail
on the triangular fossa.
Yeah, well, uh, if this whole surgeon thing doesn't pan out,
then I guess I could take my act on the road.
You know, just set up a little whittling booth
at a county fair.
I think people would pay good money for that,
especially when they hear,
it's made by Harper Avery's grandson.
Which reminds me,
do you think that he'd ever be interested
in doing a lecture here?
We've been after him for years.
You're a name brand.
You're like the freakin' Ritz-Carlton of surgery.
Who cares if that's why they want you?
Because he knows deep down he's more of a roadside motel.
Oh, oh, oh, she's going for the soup.
Bold move. She's gonna have to talk to the soup guy.
She's looking good. Looking confident.
And she bails.
No soup for Holly.
She looks terrified.
Why are you so mean?
Would you just go buy her some soup?
No, it's not mean.
She's going home soon, and Dr. Fincher says,
she has to learn to do things for herself.
Mm. And you're gonna finally
have to go to Boston for your interview.
I am not avoiding the interview.
Really?
Well, wherever you go,
just beware, they may judge you more on your personality
than what really matters, like your resume.
Meredith is not like you. Her personality doesn't suck.
Oh, pizza station.
Hey.
Oh, whatever! You know what? Those programs can suck it.
I'm tired of trying so hard not to be me.
You know what? I like me.
That makes one of us.
You make it so easy.
Look, you don't have to not be you.
Just be a little less you. That's all.
Get up.
What are you doing?
Claire Hiatt just called to tell me
you walked out on your interview.
Call her back, apologize.
Look, I respectfully withdrew my application.
You want me to drag you out by your ear?
I...
Freakin' Robbins.
So I didn't actually, uh, speak to anyone.
But... i...
Uh, did go to the self-serve station.
And it actually wasn't that hard.
What?
Nothing. Looks good.
You know who is an awesome mentor?
Ooh, you're gonna say me,
and we're gonna high-five, right?
Sloan. He gets Avery interviews at hospitals
who have more to offer
than the sundaes in their cafeteria.
Oh, relax. I just heard back from a colleague in Florida,
and he's dying to meet you.
Miami?
Mm. Tampa.
Well, just a little outside.
Why are you doing this? I thought you liked me.
Of course I do, that's why I've spent tons of time
turning you into a great doctor.
And now for my trouble, what, you're gonna ditch me
for some other program?
You don't want me to go.
You've been tanking my recommendations.
I know. It's awful. I feel really guilty about it.
But you don't know how hard it is to find a good peds fellow,
and I'm not gonna let them take my best candidate.
I'm your best?
Go away.
Look, get on the phone,
tell the people you actually respect that I'm the best--
Yale, Baylor, Brown.
No more "One hour outside of Toledos."
Did you not just hear me? I'm not gonna help you leave.
You want me to stay here because I want to,
not because I have no other choice.
Call.
Hey.
How are you feeling?
That was a pretty big deal.
Not really.
I don't know.
Braving that cafeteria line is pretty major,
even for those of us who haven't been--
Kept in a basement for 12 years? - For those of us
who haven't been through what you've been through.
Why do you do that,
talk around it?
The therapist and my parents and...
what I've been through is being...
kicked and raped and slapped and starved.
And I mean, I get it, but...
It was my life.
And I didn't get to talk to him
about my life with my parents,
and now I don't get to talk to anyone about him.
But you can talk about him.
No, I can't.
No, you'll--you'll think...
You won't get it.
Try me.
He wasn't only bad.
Sometimes he was okay.
He'd let me go upstairs and...
we'd watch stuff together--
movies.
And it was like it was normal.
When I came back here, I turned on the TV,
and there was this...
movie on that we watched together.
And I started to miss him.
And I know that's bad, and I must be sick.
And don't tell the shrink that I said anything,
'cause she...
She's gonna ask me how I feel about it.
And I don't know.
All I know is, is...
I should be happy that I'm here and not there.
But sometimes I'm not.
That's okay.
However you feel is okay.
They've called three times to see if you'd received it.
What self-respecting program sends a fruit basket anyway?
Champagne, sure, but fruit?
Fruit just says your program sucks.
Who's that?
Uh, Hopkins.
Hopkins in Maryland?
Yeah.
Well... Hopkins is a great program.
And they're recruiting you, so that's...
that's something to be proud of.
Do you want an apple?
Yeah.
Well, you have a better view of the pond.
You know, I heard that Mrs. Thompson across the hall
has a great movie collection.
Adele, what is it?
He hasn't come to visit or call.
I don't know what I did wrong.
You did nothing wrong, honey.
It's just... i'm your husband,
for 30 years now.
I'm right here. I...
This is us...
On our wedding day.
Your mother took it right after the ceremony.
You and...
We're married?
Yes, honey.
I proposed on New Year's,
and--and we were married the Valentine's after.
Allan?
Where's Allan?
Can you help me find him, sir, please?
This isn't like him. He loves me.
He wouldn't just disappear. He loves me.
Allan?
Where are you?
Allan, please come home, baby.
Please.
The C.T. showed a leak in her celiac artery graft,
So we have to take her into the O.R. right away.
Where's bailey?
I-I think you should go in and say good-bye to her
before we take her to surgery.
No.
No, you go do that.
Help her. Please.
Kathleen, this is very serious.
She doesn't trust us like she trusts you.
Take care of her, please.
She's crashing. I need a chest tray.
Let's get some gloves.
Coming through. She arrested. I need to crack her chest.
Someone, uh, page Altman.
Let's get some drapes.
Scalpel.
Thank you.
Rib spreaders.
I need some suction.
Suction.
Let's get those blinds.

Patient is 18-year-old female Holly Wheeler.
Dr. Altman?
I got the page from Dr. Yang at 2218,
and then met her and Dr. Bailey in the O.R.,
where we discovered that the previous graft
had become infected.
While we tried to interpose another graft
away from the infection,
she arrested several times on the table.
We had to restart internal cardiac massage,
give her an intracardiac epi,
and fortunately, we were able to resuscitate her.
Dr. Bailey was then able to repair the graft
and other than some initial
touch and go in the C.C.U.,
she has been stable ever since.
Your recommendation?
Patient is healthy and ready to go home.
Neuro?
Signed off.
Ortho?
We're good.
Plastics?
Send her home.
And general?
Dr. Bailey?
Dr. Bailey signs off.
Great.
Well, Holly will continue her therapy with Dr. Fincher,
but as far as surgery is concerned,
she's set to go home.
Thank you, everyone,
and especially, a thank you to Dr. Grey.
Okay, that's--
that's enough. Let's get back to work.
Great job, Hunt.
Thanks. Thank you.
They're good parents, right?
I mean, they seem like good parents.
They've been here every day since you came in,
all day, just in case you want to see them.
I have a daughter.
And I know I would want to hold her and never let go.
And they haven't done that.
They have tried to give you space
and just tried to understand
what this must be like for you.
Just give them a chance.
Just talk to them the way you talk to me.
The car's all packed. We have everything?
Uh, yeah, I think so.
We can't thank you enough.
Of course.
Oh, you don't want to leave this behind.
Yeah.
Actually, I do.
Um, I don't know.
It just reminds me of everything that I--
I missed out on.
I'm sorry. I know that it--
it means a lot to you guys, so--so we can take it
If you--if you want, but--
No, it's fine. We can leave it.
It's one of those things people say...
You can't move on
until you've let go of the past.
You have to make her stay.
What?
Cristina--she just told me
that she is flying to New York tonight to visit Columbia,
and they are gonna roll out the red carpet for her
just like every other hospital in this country.
And pretty soon, we are gonna be one of ten places
that she can pick, and we are gonna lose her.
We can't let that happen.
She is gifted and brilliant, and I...
This hospital can't lose her.
She wants to go. It's her decision.
I can't make her stay.
Owen, you are her husband,
and whatever is going on between the two of you,
I don't care. Just fix it and make her stay.
You make her stay.
You're the head of cardio. She's your resident.
If you want her to stay, you make it happen.
And don't you ever talk to me about my wife again.
I'm your chief, not your friend.
You've made that very clear.
Letting go is the easy part.
It's the moving on that's painful.
You have a good life here. You...
have friends, and, you know, sometimes...
well, I-I can get in the way of--of all that.
Of course, now if you need anything,
just pick up the phone,
and I'll stop everything, and I'll come right over.
I love you, Adele.
And I always will.
Allan, um...
Come--come and sit down.
I was just on my way out.
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.
So sometimes we fight it...
try and keep things the same.
"Be less you"?
How do you be less yourself?
There.
Less you.
What?
You put on your suit?
I gotta be at Yale first thing in the morning.
What if my flight gets delayed?
Or even worse, what if you go in there looking like a hobo
in a wrinkled ass jacket?
Where'd you learn that?
I'm an Avery. We know these things.
So I rescheduled my interview at Brigham,
and I leave in an hour.
Cheers to that.
Jackson, we gotta go.
And we're out.
Happy interviewing, losers.
I should go, too.
Don't leave.
It's Yale. No way in hell am I missing that flight
to hang out with you two drunks.
Later.
Don't choke.
Bartender. Two tequilas, please.
Two more.
You know...
this wouldn't be a totally bad bar to hang out in
if we miss our flights.
Plenty of traveling salesmen to hit on.
Well, our husbands would never know.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Things can't stay the same, though.
Flight 1243 to J.F.K. is now boarding at Gate 19.
Well...
Free flight to New York.
I'd say wish me luck, but...
I don't need it.
Cristina.
You really want to do this-- leave?
We've been preparing for this for the past five years.
Of course I want to leave.
You should, too.
At some point, you just have to let go...
Move on...

So if Miranda Bailey tells me
一天后
I need to meet a young surgeon,
then it's obvious I need to meet them.
Still, before we go any further,
I need to know how serious you are
about our program,
moving to Boston.
Because no matter how painful it is...
Very serious. In fact, it's my top choice.
