hi . i &apos;m lani richardson
reporting for kmzr in honolulu , hawaii .
you know , it &apos;s not all gloom and doom .
we actually have some good news .
tonight , patrol officers in the hpd are a little bit safer
thanks to the generosity of an anonymous good samaritan
who has donated 100 new bulletproof vests
to the department through the honolulu police foundation .
mayor kirk caldwell says ...
you just love giving your money away , don &apos;t you ?
i can &apos;t take it with me .
well ,
if you &apos;re looking for another worthy cause ,
i could use a raise .
you &apos;re probably the highest paid bartender on this island .
yeah , you &apos;re probably right .
it doesn &apos;t hurt to ask .
sorry . i lost my ball under your table .
can you grab it for me ?
walk away .
come on . help a girl out .
what did i tell you ?
hey , what the hell &apos;s your problem , katonk ?
she asked you nicely .

how did you find me ?
it wasn &apos;t easy .
you shouldn &apos;t have come .
you might have been followed .
it &apos;s over , adam .
there &apos;s no loyalty for michael anymore .
anyone who wanted revenge for his death is either dead
or locked up .
so you don &apos;t have to hide anymore .

yes , i have ... look , pay attention to me , okay ?
you are the number one most important thing in my life .
&quot; and number two isn &apos;t even close . &quot;
close . that &apos;s right .
all right ? so what does that mean ? that means that there is
zero chance i &apos;m just gonna let you go for a sleepover
without seeing exactly
who &apos;s looking after you . okay ?
grace ,

come on , you know all the moms .
okay . uh , do you have your phone in your backpack ?

come on . give me a hug .
thank you . love you , danno .
love you , too . your bag .
bye .
so , the vic &apos;s name is gus yamada .
he &apos;s a local gangbanger
with a long rap sheet that says he doesn &apos;t
play so well with others .
woman over there worked the bar last night .
says the owner , jack anderson , threw yamada
and one of his boys out around 11 : 00
after they mixed it up with another customer .
we talk to anderson ?
according to the bartender ,
he locked up the bar around 2 : 00
but apparently never made it home .
his wife reported him missing early this morning .
so , what , we think yamada and his pal
waited out here for anderson
and then confronted him about being tossed from the bar ?
it &apos;s a theory .
looks like he put up one hell of a good fight .
hey . since when does the captain of swat show up
at a homicide crime scene ?
he doesn &apos;t .
hey , commander .
yeah . you might want to take a look at this .
found this in the dumpster .
thank you .
this has got to be anderson &apos;s phone .
bridgette must be his wife .
looks like she &apos;s been trying to reach him all morning .
look at this .
his last incoming call
isn &apos;t a local number . let &apos;s see who else
has been trying to reach him .
hello ?
yeah , we need to talk .
i met jack at a charity event a few months ago .
his bar sponsors a local youth football team .
and we &apos;re both illinois boys , born and raised , and , um ...
we bonded over the &apos; 85 bears .
what brought you down here today ?
his wife bridgette called me .
she was worried he didn &apos;t come home last night ,
so she asked me to come drive down here
and see if his truck was still here .
he &apos;s a good guy , steve .
real salt of the earth ,
family man .
if he didn &apos;t come home last night , there &apos;s a problem .
look , whatever &apos;s gone down ,
we &apos;re gonna get to the bottom of it , okay ?
well , i &apos;m sure glad you &apos;re on this .
can you , um ...
just keep me in the loop ?
of course , man . come on .
hey , lou . you know what ?
i can do one better .
i could use your help on this one .
thank you .
i got a hit in codis
from a blood pool at your crime scene ,
but it &apos;s not jack anderson .
it came back to this guy .
dennis koga .
he &apos;s been in and out of prison for the last few years .
history of assault , robbery ...
hold on , hold on , hold on .
i think i recognize this guy from the hospital check i did .
yeah . dennis koga .
he was admitted to honolulu general this morning
in serious condition
with multiple contusions and fractures .
hold on a second .
if yamada is dead and this guy &apos;s in the hospital ,
where &apos;s jack anderson ?
how &apos;s grover ?
hanging in there . how about you ?
me ? i &apos;m sick .
i mean , she &apos;s only gonna be gone
for a couple of days , danny , okay ?
you &apos;re missing the point .
she did the drop @-@ and @-@ run , steve , okay ?
not even barely a kiss on the cheek .
all right ? and this is not the first time .
this is not the first time that i have looked
in my girl &apos;s eyes and seen something different .
i don &apos;t know what it is .
it &apos;s like her innocence is , uh , floating off
into space or something . i don &apos;t know what .
yeah , well , she &apos;s growing up .
okay , what are you gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna build a time machine .
i &apos;m gonna go back in time , when she
was just a baby , before i met you ,
to a happy time in my life .
okay , good luck with that .
you think this is funny , don &apos;t you ?
no , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s funny .
i &apos;m just saying you got to let her go .
you got to let her grow up .
there &apos;s nothing you can do .
you &apos;re always gonna be danno to her .
all right ? she &apos;s always gonna love you . isn &apos;t that enough ?
hey . psst . let me talk to him .
hold on .
yeah , listen , it gets worse .
oh , yeah .
yeah . wait till she asks you to take her bra shopping .
huh ? or ...
when the first boyfriend shows up .
you &apos;re gonna love that .
you ain &apos;t seen nothing yet , pal ,
so put on your big @-@ boy pants
because father time is not your friend .
will you put steve back on , please ?
yeah .
do not , under any circumstances , ever do that to me again .
truth hurt , don &apos;t it ?
okay , put him back on .
okay .
i &apos;ll tell you something else ...
excuse me .
hi . i was wondering if you might know
if this road would take me to hale iowa ?
la ... uh ... yes .
yes , it will .
what ?
i totally mangled that , didn &apos;t i ?
you did . you destroyed it completely , just assassinated it .
it &apos;s hale &apos;iwa , but don &apos;t worry . please .
i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve been here four years ,
and i can &apos;t pronounce any of the places on this island .
and i had you pegged as a local .
me ? no , no , no .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ... i &apos;m from new jersey .
no way ! we were practically neighbors . i &apos;m from new york .
really ?
yeah .
wow . that &apos;s great . are you here , uh ... ?
it &apos;s just a vacation ? are you here for business ? what ?
none of the above .
i guess you could say i came here for a fresh start .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
well , it was nice meeting you , jersey .
nice to meet you , too .
hey , is there any chance you might be headed towards hailee ... ?
hale &apos;iwa .
yeah .
i thought if you were going that way , i might follow you ?
um ... i &apos;m not , actually .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ... i &apos;m going the other direction .
oh . okay , then .
well , i &apos;m sure i &apos;ll find my way .
i mean , it &apos;s an island , right ?
how hard could it be ?
yeah . you just keep doing circles ,
you &apos;ll @-@ you &apos;ll , uh ... you &apos;ll find it .
thanks for your help .
have a good fresh start .
thanks , jersey .
hey , i &apos;m gonna ask you one more time .
jack anderson-- where is he ?
and i &apos;m gonna tell you one more time .
you want to talk , talk to my lawyer .
do me a favor , would you ?
can you close the door ?
absolutely .
just be a minute .
what &apos;s the matter ?
is everything all right , mr. koga ?
never better , nurse . thank you .
you can &apos;t do this .
oh , i am doing it . see , i &apos;m with five @-@ o.
they got immunity and means . ain &apos;t that right , commander ?
that &apos;s right , captain .
that means ... i can do whatever the hell i want .
you watch this .
wait , wait , wait , wait . i don &apos;t know where he is .
that &apos;s the truth . i swear , i don &apos;t know !
calm down , calm down . just tell me what you do know .
okay , look ...
the guy anderson disrespected gus .
he just wanted to teach the dude a lesson .
what kind of lesson ?
we waited for him .
gus had a knife .
he went at the man and tried to cut him ...
but he fought back .
i &apos;ve never seen anyone fight like that .
he got the knife away from gus and killed him with it .
planted that thing right in his chest .
i tried to help gus .
the guy beat me down .
there was nothing i could do .
but run .
would &apos;ve killed me , too , if i didn &apos;t .
all right , so you take your beating .
and where does anderson go after that ?
no idea .
so , where &apos;d your boy jack
learn to fight like that , grover ?
hell if i know .
military ?
jack &apos;s a man of few words .
he doesn &apos;t talk about himself that much .
must have been some scintillating conversations
between the two of you .
it &apos;s called being humble .
maybe you should try it sometime .
all right , so ... koga &apos;s statement confirms
that jack killed yamada in self @-@ defense .
any jury in the world would have seen it the same way .
so , where the hell is he ?
i mean , why didn &apos;t he just stick around
and call the cops ? then it &apos;s over .
better yet , why didn &apos;t he call you ?
yes , i admit , uh , following you might be a little crazy ,
but i want you to know that i am not crazy .
i know somebody who is crazy , and i am nothing ... like him .
although , i am talking to myself ,
so that makes me crazy .
dispatch , go ahead .
this is detective danny williams .
i have a woman . she &apos;s unconscious .
kamehameha highway . say about a ...
half mile east of the kawailoa exit .
i need paramedics .
what &apos;s the nature of her injuries ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s not breathing , can &apos;t find a pulse .
she &apos;s , uh ... she &apos;s unconscious .
she could be dying .
come on , just s @-@ send the ambulance , please .
oh . hello . hey .
i @-@ i got a ... i got a gunshot wound to the back of the neck .
put a rush on that ambulance , okay ?
let &apos;s go
so , the prints that csu lifted off the murder weapon
match reference prints
we took from jack anderson &apos;s house .
well , that &apos;s consistent with koga &apos;s story .
he told us anderson stabbed yamada to death
with his own knife .
what aren &apos;t you telling us , chin ?
anderson &apos;s prints also popped up in afis .
联邦调查局通缉
he &apos;s a decorated gulf war vet .
a green beret who just finished a tour in iraq
when this went down .
according to the dekalb pd ,
anderson was the driver of a getaway car
in an armed robbery of a liquor store
back in 1993 .
now , the car that he was driving crashed into another vehicle ,
killing its driver , a newlywed
named jessica haley .
she was on her way home from work .
两名嫌犯一名被捕 一名在逃
this guy really had me fooled .
well , you and a lot of other people .
his accomplices were caught fleeing the scene ,
but somehow , he seemed to disappear off
the face of the earth ... until today .
jack deliberately tossed that cell phone in a dumpster
because he didn &apos;t want anybody to find him .
jack anderson &apos;s not a missing person .
he &apos;s on the run .
is jack okay ?
did you find him ?
no , not yet . uh ,
bridgette , we need to talk to you about something .
what is it ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
steve , can you give us a minute , please ?
yeah .
did you know ?
did i know what ?
what jack did back in dekalb ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
hey , guys .
are you a policeman ?
am i a policeman ?
why ? because of this right here ?
that a real badge ?
is this a real badge ?
you want to see it ?
联邦调查局通缉
fingerprints don &apos;t lie , bridgette .
your husband is wanted for murder back in illinois .
he would never ...
you know him .
you know the kind of man he is .
i thought i did .
now , you listen to me very carefully .
in a couple of hours ,
this whole island &apos;s gonna be crawling with hpd ,
fbi and illinois state police ,
and they &apos;re all gonna be looking for your husband .
and there &apos;ll be some young , gung ho ,
trigger @-@ happy cops looking to make a name for themselves
by bringing in a fugitive on a 20 @-@ year @-@ old murder case .
and they don &apos;t know jack , the family man .
they only know jack , the fugitive , and they &apos;re gonna
bring him in by any means necessary .
bridgette , i know this is a lot . i &apos;m sorry .
but i &apos;m gonna need your help .
if you know where he might be ,
if he &apos;s tried to contact you ,
you need to tell me right now .
i don &apos;t . i swear .
bridgette , the boys said
that jack came back to the house this morning .
uh , i must have been asleep .
yeah , that &apos;s what they said .
he made them promise not
to tell anybody that he &apos;d come back here .
i guess he grabbed a rifle and some camping gear .
he also told them that
he might be away for a little while .
you got any idea where that might be ?
he goes ...
hunting in the ewa forest reserve .
uh , he @-@ he usually makes camp around the waimano stream .
okay . i know where that is . thanks .
all right , listen , don &apos;t worry ,
we &apos;re gonna bring him in safe .
meantime , you just take care of those boys ,
all right ?
瓦胡岛 怀阿诺
that looks perfect , just like that .
good .
thatta girl .
excellent . excellent . these are beautiful .
turn here . yes .
yes .
nice . that &apos;s good .
right there . keep your chin up .
nice . these are beautiful .
head down .
excuse me .
sorry . i &apos;m detective williams .
i &apos;m with five @-@ o. i need to see this weapon .
i need to see any other weapons you have here .
as soon as you tell me what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on-- there &apos;s a woman ,
she &apos;s in the hospital right now fighting for her life .
she was shot up on that highway from this beach .
like i said , i need to see all the weapons you have .
thank you .
look , detective , all the weapons on this shoot are props .
they &apos;re inoperable . trust me , i checked &apos; em myself .
all right , how long you been here this morning ?
since sunrise .
see anybody else ?
just us .
all right , i &apos;m gonna need to see
all the photographs you took here this morning .
yeah .
look , i &apos;m just calling to see how she &apos;s doing .
i don &apos;t know her name . she &apos;s the one with the gunshot wound .
how many are there ?
no , please don &apos;t put me on hold .
what do you got for me , duke ?
csu found some stuff in gus yamada &apos;s house .
thought you might be interested .
yamada doesn &apos;t strike me as the type who went to church .
all right , so what do we got here ?
photos .
directions to anderson &apos;s bar .
daily schedule .
it &apos;s a picture of his truck . this is a surveillance package .
he was being paid well .
there &apos;s ten grand in there .
it was in the gym bag along with this burner .
all right , so yamada didn &apos;t show up at anderson &apos;s bar
to sample the mai tais , they were watching him .
this was supposed to be a hit .
瓦胡岛 瓦哈瓦
any idea who would want to kill your friend ?
no . jack &apos;s a fugitive .
i imagine he &apos;s crossed a lot of people between here and chicago ,
but i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t want to be the one to speculate .
i &apos;d rather ask him myself , in person .
you can slow down if you , uh , if you can &apos;t keep up .
you know , my old man once told me ...
never mistake somebody who &apos;s moving fast
with somebody who knows where they &apos;re going .
yeah , all due respect , your old man didn &apos;t know me .
i move fast and i know where i &apos;m going .
boy , i wish i was half as good as you think you are .
long way from chicago , huh ?
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
you think i don &apos;t know my way around in the woods ?
first of all , this is a forest .
second of all , if you knew your way around this forest ...
you &apos;d know that the shrub you &apos;re standing next to
is noho malie .
it &apos;s highly poisonous .
well , thank you , ranger rick .
you &apos;re welcome .
you know , going through these woods--
oh , i &apos;m sorry , &quot; the forest &quot; --
kind of opens your mind up .
helps you see things a little differently .
what , are you getting all zen on me , now ?
no , i &apos;m just telling you i know what this is .
would you want to tell me what this is ?
this ... &quot; i could really use your help . &quot;
you think i think that you partnered up
with me on this out of the goodness of your heart ?
all right . fair enough .
you &apos;re jack &apos;s friend .
i know you &apos;re not gonna go home ,
sit in your rocking chair and wait on a call from me , okay ?
you &apos;re gonna be out here
making a mess of things , you know ?
there you go .
get in my way , so i figured i &apos;d do myself a favor , right ?
save myself the trouble .
but you &apos;re only half right .
catherine rollins is on reserve duty .
i got danno on the north shore , i &apos;m short @-@ handed ...
so i thought about it and figured
you were competent enough to tag along .
competent enough ?
you ain &apos;t exactly mount rushmore material yourself , you know .
come on , it &apos;s a simple question .
who hired you to murder jack anderson ?
i just need a name .
i don &apos;t have a name .
so do whatever you got to do .
torture me like your friends did ,
&apos;cause i can &apos;t tell you something i don &apos;t know .
yeah , well , you see , torture isn &apos;t really my style .
now , koga ... you got a three @-@ year @-@ old son and a little girl , right ?
you &apos;ve been through the system .
you know how it works .
first person to step up gets a deal ,
and yamada is dead .
i call that an opportunity .
look , you talk now ...
maybe you serve two to three years in a minimum @-@ security prison
and you get some kind of relationship with your children .
but if you don &apos;t ...
i promise you ,
you will sit in a maximum @-@ security prison
for 15 to 20 years watching your kids grow up
through a piece of plexiglas .
so you got a decision to make .
because when i walk out that door ...
the deal goes with me .
okay , look ...
i &apos;ll tell you who hired us .
decorated war hero .
never in trouble with the law .
how &apos;s a guy like that end up robbing a liquor store ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe he was drunk or high .
doesn &apos;t really matter , does it ?
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m not trying to give the guy a free pass , either .
i &apos;m just saying .
maybe he made a mistake , you know ?
it &apos;s got to stand for something that he
turned his entire life around ,
spent the next 20 years trying to make it right .
and what if it was your sister and my wife and kids
he killed in that car wreck ?
what he did before , what he did after ,
wouldn &apos;t mean a damn thing .
listen , man , you got a good point , okay ?
i &apos;m just saying ...
you can &apos;t tell me it &apos;s gonna feel good
putting the cuffs on a guy like that , now , okay ?
plus , he &apos;s your friend .
try to think of the victim &apos;s family .
well , what about jack &apos;s family ?
you think i don &apos;t have a heart ?
i got a knot in my stomach just thinking about all this .
man , i &apos;m just saying don &apos;t write him off completely , okay ?
sometimes good people do bad things .
we &apos;re all running from something , right ?
could you be any more obvious ?
excuse me ?
if you want something from me ,
just ask .
them jedi mind tricks don &apos;t work with me .
fine .
what drove you out of chicago ?
forget it . you and me-- we ain &apos;t there , yet .
hold up , hold up , h @-@ hold up .
these are fresh .
he can &apos;t be more than ten or 15 minutes ahead of us .
how you doing ? can i help you ?
uh , yeah , i &apos;m , uh , detective williams
with five @-@ o. um , just need to ask you ,
do you have a rifle on board ?
we do . we use it when we go shark fishing .
what &apos;s the problem ?
uh , you &apos;re gonna have to point to it , show me where it is .
please stay where you are .
it &apos;s in there .
in here ?
what &apos;s going on ?
this , uh , this was fired recently .
yeah . um ... we were fishing off the beach this morning ,
and nothing was biting , so , uh ...
i let my son jon use it to ...
take target practice on the chum can in the water .
weren &apos;t any other boats around . didn &apos;t think it &apos;d be a problem .
what &apos;s going on , detective ?
something happen ?
uh , yeah , something , uh ...
something pretty terrible happened , actually .
chin . go .
i know who hired yamada and koga to kill anderson .
who ?
matt haley .
he &apos;s the husband of jessica haley ,
两名嫌犯一名被捕 一名在逃
the woman that anderson killed in the car crash .
so wait a minute ,
haley finds anderson on the islands
after all these years ,
and then hires yamada to avenge his wife &apos;s death ?
what are the chances haley &apos;s on the island ?
oh , i &apos;m thinking pretty good .
i have several incoming calls to yamada &apos;s
burner phone , all from a malohi inn .
one of them was as recent as an hour ago .
it was probably haley trying to find out if the job &apos;s done .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
i &apos;ll let you know . i &apos;m on my way .
copy that .
you see that ?
200 yards up ahead .
see those birds ?
yeah , i see .
all right .
we &apos;re gonna split up .
i &apos;m gonna maintain this heading .
lou , i want you to flank north .
okay ?
yeah .
remember ... radio silence and good target i.d.
i got you .
you shouldn &apos;t have come .
how many with you ?
i &apos;m alone .
with a radio ?
let &apos;s go .
move !
so what &apos;s the plan now , jack ?
what are you gonna do ? you gonna kill me ,
then hide up here in the woods for the rest of your life
living happily ever after ?
personally , i don &apos;t think you got it in you .
sure , you took that guy in the alley ,
but that &apos;s kill or be killed .
stop talking and keep moving .
that woman you killed , jack , that was an accident .
and i know that you &apos;ve done a lot of things , good things ,
to try to make that right ,
but you never will .
you never will till you own up to it .
i own up to it every day .
you don &apos;t think i carry that with me ?
that woman is in my head all the time .
i was a good guy ,
and i just did something stupid .
i got behind the wheel of a car ,
and in ten minutes , my life changed forever
and i can &apos;t undo that .
no matter how hard i try .
you think you &apos;re the only one ?
you think i don &apos;t know what living with regret is like ? hmm ?
every day , i look in the mirror and i think to myself ,
&quot; what if i did this ? what if i did that ? &quot;
so welcome to the club , my friend .
listen to me , jack .
you got to end this thing .
hmm ? you got to end it right now , jack .
not for me .
take a second to think about bridgette and them two boys .
oh , jack .
you got him ?
about time . what happened ?
i was trying to figure out a way to save your ass , wasn &apos;t i ?
all right , come on , jack , let &apos;s go . on your feet .
five @-@ o ! get on your knees . hands behind your head .
matt haley , you &apos;re under arrest for conspiracy
and the attempted murder of jack anderson .
mitchell . jack mitchell .
that was his name when he killed my wife .
what are we doing here ? i told you .
i don &apos;t want my wife and kids to see me like this .
turn around . give me your hands , jack .
you know what you got to do . go ahead .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
look , there &apos;s something i need to tell you ,
and i should have told you a long time ago .
so how much of that sermon you gave in the forest was true ?
all that stuff about living with regret ,
looking at yourself in the mirror , blah , blah , blah .
so you heard that ?
the whole thing .
then i guess that means you heard me say me and you ain &apos;t there yet .
hey . hey , boys .
how you doing , boys ?
hey , listen to me , all right ? look ,
daddy &apos;s gonna have to go away for a little while , okay ?
but i want ... i want you to behave for your mom .
you understand ? all right .
give me a hug . give me a hug .
thank you .
if you don &apos;t mind ,
there &apos;s one more stop i &apos;d like to make .
the church bulletin ?
that &apos;s how you found jack mitchell ?
a couple weeks ago , a buddy of mine from dekalb
was here on vacation .
he went to mass , saw the picture .
thought it looked a lot like mitchell .
so i did some digging .
turns out he was right .
did it ever cross your mind to go to the police ?
