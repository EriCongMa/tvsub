Renegades.
Rule breakers.
Gangsters with scalpels.
This is the way we like to think of ourselves.
It makes us feel badass,
sexy.
Can you wash this, too?
Jackson.
Is there anywhere you don't do it?
No?
We should go upstairs.
Yeah.
Problem is,
it's not exactly true.
At heart, we're rule followers,
sheep.
We don't break protocol.
We follow it to a "t."
Why is there a trailer in my parking spot?
Is one of these yours?
My bad.
You're living here,
in a trailer in the parking lot?
Well, I'm in the race for chief resident, you know?
I get to the surgeries first.
I'm here when the chief arrives.
Just get the thing out of my spot.
And move my car.
Because if we don't follow protocol,
our patients die.
And then we're no longer badass.
We're just bad.
When are the two of you finally getting married?
Meredith and Derek already got married, honey.
Remember?
I know that.
They wrote on a post-it.
I meant a real wedding.
In a church, with a white dress.
This isn't Alzheimer's, Richard.
Adele, the tests we ran last month
showed findings consistent with early-onset Alzheimer's.
I was a nurse for 30 years, Derek.
I know what Alzheimer's looks like.
I also know that 20% of the people
that are diagnosed with it
turn out to have something else.
I don't have Alzheimer's. I don't.
So a lot of patients need time
to come to terms with their diagnosis.
The same thing happened to my mother.
We don't have time.
Derek, we need to get Adele in
on your trial right now.
We need her consent to even consider her.
Look, I'll take care of that. Don't worry.
We don't even know if she fits the criteria.
And the trial is full.
Even the waiting list is full.
I know all of that.
I also know that you'll do
whatever you need to do to help my wife.
Everything looks fine.
Right on track for 23 and a half weeks.
How's his size?
Oh, Mark.
It's okay. I'm used to that trick.
Its size is within the norm.
Come on. We're here.
You know you want to know.
No, no, no, no. You want to know.
We prefer an element of surprise.
Callie?
Mark, we voted.
2-to-1. We're waiting.
Uh, your B.P. is borderline high.
Are you feeling okay?
Oh, yeah, no.
That's the nerves about the baby shower.
Ah. Yeah, it's like, um,
it's like christmas morning.
You are way too excited about this.
Hey, I have bought expensive gifts
and played stupid games
for every knocked-up nurse in this place.
Now it's my turn.
You're coming, right?
Arizona, you invite the O.B..
The fate of my vagina's in her hands.
Um, 1:00 p.m., fourth floor doctor's lounge.
I'll see if I can make it.
I'll make it.
What's that about?
Oh, Chief's in the bathroom.
With an audience?
His trial funding came through this morning,
and they all want on it.
Door's opening!
Quiet! Quiet!
I haven't made my decision yet.
Oh, get out of the way.
Stalking a man while he's in the restroom?
I'd clean the restroom if he'd let me on this trial.
I'd live in it.
You are surgeons.
If you want to impress the chief,
impress him surgically.
Avery, you're with me.
So you've been all buddy-buddy with Webber lately.
I am staying out of it, but you...
you are very beautiful.
Oh, screw beautiful. I'm brilliant.
If you want to appease me, compliment my brain.
Okay.
Ah, Sonya. You ready for the big day?
You bet.
Try to shave as little of my head as possible.
It's hard enough dating with Alzheimer's.
I can't be bald, too.
I promise. You must be Tarik.
Congratulations on the marathon, by the way.
You didn't.
He's not like other doctors.
He's actually interested in his patients.
Yeah, I heard you just moved back from london.
Yeah, I came as soon as
you accepted us into the trial.
I can't thank you enough.
No, I'm glad you're here. Thank you.
All right, I'm gonna let Dr. Grey
get on with her work,
and I'll see you in a little bit.
Okay, Mrs. Amin, I'm going to say three words to you
and ask you to repeat them back to me later.
Truck. Cabin. Spoon.
Truck. Cabin. Spoon.
Okay.
Uh, what did you do for thanksgiving last year?
Oh! I was in London visiting Tarik.
What? Why? Is that wrong?
Last year, you were at the Simmons', remember?
No. I was with you and Gavin in London.
I have that picture outside the palace.
That was three years ago, Mom,
before we broke up.
You really should call him.
He broke up with me. We're not getting back together.
Sorry. Out of all the things she can't remember,
she still remembers the ex.
Okay, starting at 100, count backwards by 7.
100.
93.
Good morning, Clara.
Good's kind of pushing it.
Yeah, I hear you.
Uh, Dr. Avery.
Clara Green, 42,
type 1 diabetic.
Eight weeks post-op from a tumor resection.
You know what? No, I'm sorry.
I can't listen to the kid today.
I would like to hear from the grown-up doctor.
Sean.
I don't want to hear from the stupid kid anymore!
I want answers.
Okay, Sean, um,
I know it's incredibly frustrating--
You don't know.
My kids are in Iowa living with my parents.
Okay, I barely survived that house.
Now I'm inflicting it on my kids?
Diabetes is a bear of an illness.
Now the tumor removal was successful,
but we knew it could be tough
getting the insulin levels on track.
And, yeah, it has been tough.
Well, that's not good enough anymore.
We are doing everything--
Sean, she's doing better than any of us expected.
You remember when we talked about how
she might not make it through the surgery?
Dr. Bailey said she was prepared to roll the dice,
but surgery was a gamble.
Clara rocked it.
And if she can do that, she can do anything.
You need any help today?
Robbins has her baby shower, so I'm free.
I still don't like you, Karev.
Dude.
Good-bye.
I just finished recasting the O'Connor girl.
Did you still need me to change Jason Cook's drain?
Nope. All done.
So you can handle the rest of the patients, right?
I think we got a thoracentesis in there.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you.
We're on for tonight, 7:00 reservation?
Oh, you know it.
All right.
You're gonna screw your way to the top. I'm impressed.
I am not screwing Stark.
I am not screwing Stark.
We're not even dating.
We're not even dating.
I'm serious. We're not.
Okay, maybe I thought we were at first.
But it's not like that now. We're just hanging out.
We're friends.
Yeah, naked friends.
What do you have?
Jogger found unconscious on the street. No I.D.
Dr. Yang's running the code.
He's in v-fib.
Okay.
Clear.
You had chest pain, so you decided to go for a jog?
Ow!
Oh. Sorry.
How much morphine did you give him?
10.
He shouldn't be in this much pain.
Give him more.
So what is this, a heart attack?
'Cause it sure feels like one.
I don't know.
We're gonna have to run some tests to find out.
A jog?!
Hey, it's not like I went out for a cheeseburger.
Her name is Clara Green. Now I know it's premature,
but I was thinking she could be a candidate for your trial.
Look, I still don't have approval from the FDA, Bailey.
Sir, these people are desperate.
If we could just make them first on the list
to give 'em something to look forward to.
Well, why not just do the surgery today?
Avery, just because a patient called you a stupid kid
doesn't mean you should act like one.
She can't even take immunosuppressants
without risking her tumor coming back.
She's deteriorating by the hour.
Why not apply for an emergency waiver?
Because if something goes wrong during the surgery,
then it would kill the chief's chance for getting approval.
Sir, her kids are stuck in Iowa...
Dr. Avery--
...with their grandparents, who are mean, sir.
Chief, Dr. Altman's paging you.
I'll call the FDA,
see if we can get a waiver.
Get the patient on board.
Okay.
What? I...
Where do you want this?
What's that for?
Scrapbook station.
Put it next to that box with the glitter pens.
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't put it anywhere. We're not having a scrapbook station.
You heard Callie this morning.
She wants us to go all out.
Move the table.
No, don't move the table.
Mark, this isn't a scrapbook station kind of shower.
You're wrong. Yang, tell her.
Torres wants all the girlie stuff--
Games, onesie decorating.
I have a patient.
Grey?
I can't get over the fact that you know
what onesie decorating is.
I've been boning up.
That's what you do for the people you love.
Oh, bite me, Mark.
Oh, what's going on?
Are you guys fighting again?
Did you want a scrapbook station?
Oh, yeah. Of course. It's not a real shower
if you don't get to take home a scrapbook.
Ooh, we should have glitter pens!
No, you can't. Because if you quit and move here,
you'll get depressed and start to hate me.
Look, I have to go. Just...
Please stop calling. Good-bye.
They're ready. Can you bring the chart?
Sorry. The boyfriend thing is a little more complicated
than she can handle.
So you two are still together or--
No. Why?
Well, we require the caretaker
to be a full-time resident
of the State of Washington.
I know that.
Okay. I mean, it's a big commitment.
And it may not feel like it now, but six months from now,
a year down the road-- it can get overwhelming.
And if you think you might move back to London, if there's
even the slightest chance, you need to let us know.
Look, when I came out to my family,
my mother stood by me, she loved me.
And I know that may not seem like a big deal to you,
but in my family, where we come from, being gay isn't something
people just come to accept after a while.
It's a crime, and--and people die because of it.
And--and my father refused to deal with it, so he left.
He got a new wife, and my mom lost everything.
This--this is the least I could do for her.
I'm committed to this trial, Dr. Grey.
Okay.
Now islet cells produce insulin.
We would put the cells in a device in your body,
and it will act like a brand-new pancreas.
We're contacting the FDA
to get their approval right now.
Say yes. Okay, I-I yelled at him this morning.
I acted like an ass--
What are the risks?
I mean, they have to be pretty serious, right?
Otherwise, the FDA would've already approved it.
Dr. Bailey?
Y-yeah, there are risks, of course.
I was just about to get there.
Um... There's heavy bleeding,
uh, low platelet counts,
um, and stress on the liver.
But in Clara's condition,
e-especially since we've done everything else,
um, this really is the best option.
Can we have some more time? Is that okay?
Oh, y--of course. Yeah.
T-take all the time you need.
Eli?
Go do something else.
What was that?
What was what?
I was getting to those risks.
You interrupted me to seem like I was hiding something.
Well, in my experience, doctors do hide things.
I just asked a question they didn't know to ask.
That's all.
No, that's not your job.
I think it is.
To undermine surgeons and alarm patients?
To care for patients-- that's my job.
Making sure they understand
what highly experimental procedures
they're signing up for seems a part of that.
Oh, I thought that was my job, you know,
especially considering that I am the one who specializes
in said highly experimental procedures.
Oh. Okay. I get it. You're the doctor. I'm the nurse.
I should know my place, right?
N--okay, enough.
Um, there is a doctor-nurse protocol
in this hospital for a reason.
You know it. I know it. Let's just agree to follow it.
Not if it hurts the patient.
Hey. You paged.
Yeah. Um, I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it to dinner by 7:00.
These post-ops are taking
me longer than I thought.
Okay, skip dinner.
Hey, you know, <i>From Here to Eternity</i> is on cable.
We could just grab dinner at my place.
Okay. Sounds fun.
Um, I still don't know what time I'll finish.
Karev, could you help Dr. Kepner with her patients?
Now you need my help?
Don't push me, dude.
Okay, so if you take these,
then I can do the rest.
What?
The only way you'll be watching that movie
is if it's playing on his bedroom ceiling.
His E.K.G. and cardiac enzymes were normal,
so a heart attack seems unlikely.
We're doing a C.T. angio to rule out dissection or aneurysm.
Dr. Altman, you okay to stay on the case,
considering your personal relationship?
Richard, we've been over this.
It's a business arrangement. Nothing more.
How are you feeling?
Great. Great.
Great. Great, great, great.
Painkillers finally kicked in, huh?
Well, enjoy the ride.
I've been thinking lately,
and I think--I, uh, I think I figured it out.
And... why all of your dates go so bad.
So, so bad.
Laughably bad.
And it's not your fault.
It's mine, 'cause I'm--I'm not the guy on them with you.
We're ready to start.
Teddy, wait, wait.
You're my wife.
You're my wife.
Henry, um--
I'm your husband.
Let's do it. Let's be together.
I mean, look at you.
Look at your eyes.
Look at--you're not looking at your eyes.
I could look into your eyes my whole life.
Business arrangement?
He's hopped up on painkillers.
Which just means his inhibitions are down.
Oh, come on, Richard.
Look, even if he meant what he said, I--
I don't feel that way. I-I don't.
And scans are up.
Damn it. He's got a mass. It's close to his heart.
I'm gonna have to take it out right away.
You?
I'm not sure I should allow you in that O.R.
Let alone allow you to operate on him.
Chief, with all due respect--
I can do it.
It's an extremely delicate surgery.
I soloed on a similar surgery last month.
I nailed it... is what you said.
Problem solved.
Yang will do the surgery. You'll supervise.
Chief--
I've made my decision, Dr. Altman.
Now if you'll excuse me.
He was gonna kick you out of the O.R.
At least this way, you get to stay in.
It's win-win.
Don't feel bad. I've known Torres a long time.
She's a traditional girl, Catholic.
You know, this whole baby-out-of-wedlock thing,
the three parents--it's a lot for her to swallow.
That's why I figured, the bigger shower, the better.
Oh, shut up.
Excuse me?
You're not the Callie whisperer.
And I'm not a monster for finding baby showers annoying.
Every woman who's ever had a pregnant friend hates them.
It's like a wedding.
The bridesmaids always want to strangle the bride.
It's practically a rule.
The only one who's not normal here is you for acting like
you're enjoying this.
Okay, Arizona's turn.
Uh, I'm fine. I'm fine over here. Thanks.
Oh, just 'cause I'm the pregnant one
doesn't mean you don't get to play.
Come on. It'll be fun.
It's what the bride wants.
I'm going.
I'm glad you came. I know it's awkward.
No, you know, it's-- it's not.
It's--I'm--I'm hap--
I'm happy for you, you know.
And, uh, plus, I'm seeing somebody else, so...
Really?
Yeah.
That's, uh... good for you.
Do I know him?
I should go.
I know they're not paying you well,
but this seems a little extreme.
Ah, I just moved into my own place.
I don't have time to shop. Pass me those cookies.
All these people in here, and you came to talk to me.
You like me.
No, I'm talking to you because I want something to eat,
and you're in the way.
Admit it. You find me charming.
Are those pigs in a blanket?
Hot. Dirty hot.
It was good talking to you, Dr. Karev.
I say he's totally gay.
Well, if he were gay,
then why would he ask April out?
No straight guy waits a whole month
before making a move.
Maybe he has herpes.
That wouldn't stop a guy either. I vote gay.
I just wish he was into me,
then I could be in all his cool surgeries, too.
He's not gay, he doesn't have herpes,
and I'm not using him to get cool surgeries.
We have a lot to talk about, okay?
He's really interesting once you get to know him.
Which is why she's taking her pants off for him tonight.
What?
She's going to his place.
<i>From Here to Eternity</i> is playing on cable.
Oh, yeah.
Pants are definitely coming off.
Nobody's pants are coming off.
Movie at his place?
That's the definition of pants coming off.
Virgin's a goner.
And with an older man, too. It's very impressive.
I am not taking my pants off for Stark!
Oh, my God. That is so ugly.
Are you still blind?
I like it. It's abstract.
Check it out. Scrubs.
Yes, I will do a consult now.
You're not fooling anyone.
Chief.
Uh, Derek.
I need a favor.
I'm applying for an emergency waiver with the FDA.
I need you to call your guy that helped you
through your trial over there,
see if he can push my request through.
All right. I'll see what I can do.
But you're the chief of surgery. I'm not sure
how much more pull I'm gonna have.
There's always ways to work the system, Derek.
We both know that.
I can't put Adele in my trial, Richard.
I've looked at it all day.
Well, go over it again.
You're not hearing me.
I love Adele,
but I can't pull a patient off the waiting list.
It could compromise the whole trial.
It could get us blacklisted by the FDA.
Look, Adele has no future without this!
Chief.
Yes.
Sorry. It, uh, it's Clara Green.
You need to come now.
What happened?
Sugar bottomed out again. No response.
Why won't she wake up?
Uh, she's in a hypoglycemic coma.
Her sugar dropped too fast, so her brain doesn't have
enough to feed on.
SATs are dropping, and she's got rales.
I'm gonna set up to intubate.
What? Wait. W-what's going on?
Mr. Green, there's no time to wait.
Now if we're gonna try this islet cell transplant,
we need to do it now. We just need your consent.
Yeah, of course. You do whatever you need to do.
All right.
Let's book an O.R.
Sir, the FDA hasn't given us the waiver.
Look, I know that.
This woman will die without this surgery.
Now book an O.R. Now.
I don't understand.
Why does Dr. Yang have to do the surgery?
Well, you and I are technically married,
and the hospital doesn't allow doctors
to treat family members.
Right, because how can you stay objective?
Your feelings get in the way.
Is it wrong that I'm a little flattered
that, uh, you won't operate on me?
Ahem. Dr. Yang is excellent.
And I will be there to supervise.
I'll see you in surgery.
She's into me, right?
Can I have your arm, please?
So this Karev guy,
you're actually friends with him?
That's real?
Yeah. Why?
Uh, just it surprises me, is all.
I mean, you don't seem like the type of girl
to put up with his whole neanderthal thing, so...
Tell me. What am I missing?
You're missing a lot.
He had a girl go crazy on him.
His wife almost died, and then she walked out on him.
And then he was shot and almost bled to death in an elevator.
He's been through a lot.
So the neanderthal thing is just... It is an act.
A well-executed one.
We are through the peritoneum and ready for the implant.
Anything from the FDA?
Nothing, Chief.
Damn it.
Sir, I-I think we should wait.
The longer we wait, the worse she gets.
I know, but... Are you sure we're doing this
for the right reason,
that you're not trying to prove a point to Shepherd, maybe?
I'm thinking of my patient here, Bailey.
That's all.
Hybrid device.
Implanting it in the omentum,
near the large intestine loops.
I left my phone when I went to the cafeteria.
She saw Gavin's name, so she picked up.
Please. You can't let her do this.
We'll talk to her. Don't worry.
What's going on, Sonya?
I'm not doing the trial.
I'm sorry if I've wasted your time.
Mom, just listen to him.
I don't have to.
I'm going home, and you're going to London. It's done.
Sonya, you were chosen from hundreds of applicants,
and this surgery-- I can't guarantee anything--
but it could help.
There won't be another opportunity like this.
I'm sorry. I've made up my mind.
Please take me off your list.
She's not lucid, Dr. Shepherd.
This is just the Alzheimer's.
She's already consented.
My name is Sonya Lela Amin. I was born Sonya Beshari.
My parents were Ahmed and Saleemeh Beshari.
I live at 3105 River Road.
I spent last thanksgiving with the Simmons',
but three years before, I was in London with Gavin,
who did not break up with you. You broke up with him...
last week, when I got on the trial.
You did that for me,
and that makes me very proud.
I raised a good son.
You are a good son.
Go back to London. Be with gavin.
Ready to resect the tumor.
Bovie.
Slow and steady.
Any disturbance to his heart,
and he could go into a hypertensive crisis.
He's pre-medicated. I'm all over it.
Steady, Yang.
I got it.
Good, good.
Now just irrigate and explore.
B.P.'s shooting up.
What did you do, Cristina?
I don't know. Suction.
Damn it, Cristina.
I got it. Don't worry.
All right. Check for residual tumor.
I am. You know, I need more light. Pickups.
Hurry up. Come on. Did you find anything?
Cristina?
Cristina, I need you to talk to me right now.
Do you need me to do this?
I need you to shut up and stop acting like a scared wife.
There, I got it. I... I got it.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--
No, no, it's--it's okay. It's just...
Thank you.
Hey, Richard.
You know, I just did my first trial surgery
without FDA approval.
Maybe they'll take my license.
Maybe they'll blacklist me.
You know what? I don't care. I saved a life.
Yes. Uh, Richard.
Yeah?
Someone just dropped out of my trial.
That's why you dragged me back in here--
for another test?
It's just a few questions
to see if you meet the criteria, honey.
And then what?
I let Derek drill into my brain for no reason?
Look, I just did a surgery that I wasn't approved to do.
I did it because I knew I didn't have any time to wait.
The patient would've died.
It's the same for you.
You have Alzheimer's, honey.
You do. There's no time to wait to treat it.
Please take the test, baby.
Do it for me.
Fine.
I'll take the test.
Thank you.
But I'm going to pass.
That way...
You'll see I'm fine, healthy.
We're going to grow old together
just like we always said.
We're going to grow old together.
What is that, a tumbleweed, a hurricane?
What's your problem?
Oh, someone threw out the gift list,
and now we don't know who got what,
and people are gonna think of us as the type of people
who write vague and impersonal thank-you notes.
I'm not sure that's actually a type of people.
What's going on?
Arizona lost the gift list.
Yes, Mark. I lost the list.
I-I-I suck at this. Congratulations.
You're a better woman than I am.
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. It's not a big deal.
Mark, can you give us a minute?
She lost the gift list, not me.
Mark.
So... there is one more gift left to open.
Oh, I-I didn't get you anything.
You got me a shower.
Open it.
毗邻西雅图 远离雨城嚣
It's a b&b a few hours away.
We leave in the morning.
But I have patients, and you have patients--
Look, look, I'm extending an olive branch here,
because I know how annoying I must be to you right now.
But since I was 4 and I got that doll
that craps its pants for Christmas,
I've wanted a kid,
because other than cracking bones, this--
this baby is my dream.
And I get to be insanely, out-of-my-mind happy for my dream.
But I'm not discounting your need to vomit over my insanity.
So just...
let me... let me take you to the stupid b&b for the weekend.
And thank you.
What did you do for thanksgiving last year?
Mm. Nothing.
Uh, Richard and I stayed home,
ordered in Chinese,
and it was lovely.
Okay.
Starting at 100,
count backwards by 7.
100.
93.
86.
The Rodriguez boy
had an incarcerated incisional hernia,
but we did conscious sedation and were able to reduce it.
This was all while I was in surgery. I am impressed.
Well, Dr. Karev did most of it, actually.
Oh, Dr. Karev? Okay. Well, that's good to know.
I'll check to make sure it was done right.
Robert, just say thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Karev. Now go away.
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to call you that.
There's no need to apologize, Dr. Kepner.
No, no, no. It was completely unprofessional.
I promise I will never-- I completely--
Hey, April... I'm saying, I liked it.
I-I-I can't make it tonight.
To... What?
The new chief resident is getting picked soon,
and--and--and e-everyone is stepping up their game,
so I should probably just stay late here... Work.
I'm sorry. I...
I understand.
We've got the age difference, we work together,
Not to mention, you are very beautiful.
But still, you know,
I'd hoped you wouldn't feel the need to use work
as an excuse to get out of spending time with me.
Oh, no, no, no, no, I wasn't.
I enjoy spending time with you...
Oh. So much.
It's just, I...
I guess, I j--I just think of you more as a friend.
Friends. You know, we're--
We're friends.
But that's the thing, you know?
I never wanted to be just your friend.
Good night, Dr. Kepner.
You needed to score a 26 or below
to meet the criteria of the trial.
You were above that.
Well, what is it?
It's not important--
Derek.
It's 27.
One point?
You're going to deny her this because of one point?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry? No. It's good. It means I passed.
I-I'm not sick.
I told you, Richard.
That's not what it means.
You have Alzheimer's.
It just hasn't progressed enough to get into the trial.
But Derek said I passed.
I passed.
Meredith...
I'm okay, right?
When I asked you to repeat the three words back to me,
you said "pool" instead of "spoon."
I asked you to identify my stethoscope.
It took you a while to find the word.
And I asked you where you took your honeymoon,
and you said Hawaii.
But you were here,
because the chief was a medical student,
and he had to work.
You're just a resident. What do you know?
What the hell do any of you know?
You work in a hospital all day
around sick people and disease.
You're obsessed. That's what this is.
So I got a few answers wrong.
That's all?
It's normal to forget things at my age.
I...
You can never remember where you parked the car
whenever we go to the movies,
and they're not saying that you have...
it's not fair.
I finally...
It's...
We're finally happy...
You and me--
Loving each other the way we should have all these years.
And now?
It's not fair!
Don't look at me like that--
Like-- like I'm damaged goods.
I-I'm still me. I'm still here.
I'm still me. I...
Maybe--maybe I won't be here much longer,
but I'm right here, baby.
I'm right here.
You do-- I'm so scared.
Richard.
Help me. Please. I'm so scared.
You can help me.
Please. Please. Please.
I'm here.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here.
Clara green's extubated.
Her SATs are 100%,
and her glucose levels are stable.
No organ damage. It's working, chief.
It's working.
Well, good, 'cause I just talked to the FDA.
They gave us a waiver.
I just heard the waiver came through.
We did it, right? You know, a good chief resident would be--
You need to pick a chief resident already.
I mean, Alex Karev is living in a trailer
in the hospital parking lot.
Residents are waiting for you outside bathrooms--
Karev's living in the parking lot?
You know, your trial is up and running,
and you've got things to deal with at home.
You don't need to be picking a new chief resident, too.
Let somebody else handle that.
Delegate.
Okay. I'd like you to--
No. I raised those babies.
Um, what I mean is, delegate to someone else,
who is not me.
Good night, Dr. Bailey.
Good night.
And, sir... congratulations on the surgery.
It was a clean excision, and we got clean margins.
You're gonna be okay.
So what I said before...
about your eyes?
It wasn't just the painkillers.
Henry, you gotta stop.
You gotta stop talking to me about my eyes
and flirting with me
in front of other doctors.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay. I'm not sorry.
I meant what I said.
All of it...
if not more.
I get it.
It's a great story.
We get married to save your life,
then we fall in love--
I mean, how romantic is that?
Not to mention that you are...
smart and funny
and not at all hard on the eyes.
And I would be lying
to say that it's never crossed my mind.
But I-I don't feel it.
It's...
It's not real.
It's just a good story.
What's so wrong with a good story?
I'm sorry.
Did you hear back from the patient
on the waiting list?
I haven't called yet.
Maybe Richard's right. It's just one point.
But it's a point that could ruin the trial for everyone else
that we're trying to save.
Call them.
well, I heard the good news.
Our patient's doing well.
Sorry. Your patient, doctor.
Oh, Eli. I'm tired.
Good.
Then just admit I was right so we can kiss and make up.
Not that tired.
Miranda Bailey, we are not inside the hospital.
Inside the hospital, you're the man.
That's the protocol. But outside, I'm the man.
I am the man. Me.
Now you can call me cro-magnon or old-fashioned,
but that is not going to stop me
from taking you home to my bed tonight
and showing you what kind of man I am.
Now how's that? Does that protocol suit you?
Yeah.
Good.
Be at my place in 15.
This is your new place.
You hungry? I got, uh, crab cakes,
uh, cucumber sandwiches.
You ate all the pigs in a blanket, so...
I'll take a beer.
So this was your plan--
wait for me on the stoop of your trailer you squat in?
What?
You were waiting for me,
'cause you find me charming.
Hot?
What? No, I, uh, I was just--
And now you're stuttering because I intimidate you.
Whatever.
Which explains it, really.
Why you haven't made a move this whole time.
Oh, that's complete bull.
And now...
You're forcing me to do it.
So was I right?
Do you mind?
Nope.
Although, if it were me, and I had someone to make out with,
I might want to do it in private, like in a room,
where there's a door that locks.
Okay. Let's go upstairs.
It's every doctor's dilemma--
Do you play it safe and follow protocol...
Yep. Actual real dinner.
In honor of me rocking my surgery today.
If Webber doesn't pick me for chief resident,
he's an idiot.
... or take a risk and invent a new one?
Cristina.
Yes, darling?
Richard just asked me to take over
picking the chief resident.
Oh, my God. This is awesome.
You can...
Oh, my God. This is-- this sucks. This sucks.
You can't-- you can't pick me.
Everyone's gonna say it's 'cause you're my husband.
This... No! No! What? Oh, no.
This is--what? Oh, god. How can you eat?!
This is not fair! Wait. Wait. Wait. No.
No, no, this--no.
There can be reward in risk.
There can also be fallout.
we've been gone all of ten minutes.
What could Mark possibly want?
I don't know.
Oh, y--okay. This is-- this is bad.
He found out Lexie's with Avery. He's freaking.
Watch this.
Ah--oh, what the hell?
Just let go.
What? This is--this is--this is time for us. It's just for us.
And the first thing that you want
to do is talk to Mark, so--
You just said it was okay.
Okay. All right. You know what?
Screw it. No, I am gonna--
What are you doing?
I'm gonna talk to him!
Don't you dare call him. I...
This is jealousy, Arizona. You are jealous of Mark.
Get over it. Well,
Do you-- do you blame me?
I mean, he gets most of you--
The straight you, the--the Catholic you,
the girl who loves baby showers.
I just get, you know, the gay you... Oh.
Which is really only about 20 minutes a night, and not even,
since you just feel too fat to even let me touch you lately.
Look, I am doing my best here to make sure that you are happy
and that Mark's happy and that the tiny person
growing inside me is happy.
I don't know what else I can do, to be honest.
Please tell me, 'cause I'll do it.
Whatever will make you happy, I will do it.
Still, you need to buck the system
every once in a while.
Bet big.
Marry me.
What?
I-I mean it.
I love you more than... anything.
But I want more.
I want commitments. I want rings.
So...
Marry me.
And when you get the results you want?
There's no better feeling in the world.
