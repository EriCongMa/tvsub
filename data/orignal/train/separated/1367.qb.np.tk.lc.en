boy , it must be rough having too much money .
wait , hold on . don &apos;t lock it yet .
yeah , there we go .
that makes four .
you &apos;re eating all the profits .
how &apos;d you ever even get a license ?
&apos;cause i look good in a suit .
how long has the parking lot camera been down ?
i have no idea . isn &apos;t that your job ?
finish locking up , would ya ?
i &apos;m gonna go check out the camera .
i will not be going home tonight if that thing &apos;s busted .
‭ jane !
what is it ? what &apos;s wrong ?
what -- what &apos;s wrong ? what are you doing here ?
i @-@ i was just stopping by .
you were watching us .
no .
how long have you been sneaking in ?
it &apos;s not sneaking . i have a key .
i understand the nervousness , but this is not a solution .
it &apos;s just until we catch him , maura .
you need to talk to someone .
melanie has been really helpful .
she &apos;s given me a lot of tools
to help me cope with having been abducted .
every time i feel anxious or scared ,
i just write it in my journal .
it &apos;s a way of avoiding the onset of p.t.s.d.
so what are you doing up in the middle of the night ?
it &apos;s a process .
all right , well , we &apos;ll see how your therapy goes ,
and maybe i &apos;ll consider talking to somebody .
your jacket is so wrinkled .
quit it !
you could have ironed it .
you have bags under your eyes .
i don &apos;t have bags under my eyes . do -- do i ?
gotcha .
anyone hungry ?
you know , i bet those aren &apos;t like the kind my mom makes .
come on .
body &apos;s back there .
what ? robbery gone bad ?
first unit on the scene
talked to the security guard , jeff collins .
he said he and the owner , otis reynolds ,
were closing up for the night .
should she be back so soon ?
w--
yeah . it &apos;s good for her to get into her regular routine .
keeps her mind focused .
what &apos;s with the security cameras ?
collins noticed that
the parking lot camera was malfunctioning .
when he went to check it out ,
two masked guys with guns were at the door ,
forced their way in .
do we know how they disabled the cameras ?
wiring appears intact .
we &apos;re taking it back to the crime lab .
collins said reynolds was trying to lock the safe ,
and the bad guys came in and that one started shooting .
mm , to keep otis from locking everything up .
otis took a round to the head .
is he alive ?
surgeon said it &apos;s a miracle he &apos;s still alive , but he is .
our victim has a single close contact gunshot wound
to the chest , no exit wound .
what about the guard ?
took one to the chest and still managed to shoot our dead guy .
the vest saved his life , but he is hurtin &apos; .
he passed out , called 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 when he came to .
he didn &apos;t say anything about the second guy ?
no , just that it happened in the blink of an eye .
well ...
if the accomplice is trying to get to the money ,
i mean , he -- he would &apos;ve left a bloody footprint .
well , maybe the gunplay scared him off .
yeah .
hey , can you bag that up and get it to the crime lab ?
maybe our accomplice needed something to calm his nerves .
and that &apos;s a lot of dough .
and until the state and federal drug laws
catch up to each other ,
little places like this are always gonna have
a lot of cash lying around .
it &apos;s a gold rush .
it &apos;s a green rush .
and with that much green ,
there &apos;s always gonna be someone who wants to steal it .
you &apos;re tracking airline flights ?
no .
this is about not being able to find a link
between maura &apos;s kidnapper , joe harris , and jane .
since harris leads us nowhere , i circled back to the hacker
who broke into your sister &apos;s bank accounts .
hoping that he can lead us to whoever &apos;s behind all this .
exactly . this is wingate bouncing .
hacker &apos;s hiding his i.p. address
by bouncing the signal to hundreds of servers .
the only thing i &apos;ve learned so far
is how badly this guy does not want to be found .
speaking of found , you got anything on our dead robber ?
theodore &quot; teddy &quot; white .
35 years old from charlestown .
two @-@ bit thief , marijuana dealer .
did time for both .
he &apos;s been caught for almost everything he &apos;s ever done .
someone should &apos;ve told him to pick another line of work .
any luck with the other videos we pulled ?
no . the pot palace parking lot camera was down .
none of the city traffic cameras caught anything ,
and i came up empty on private security cameras in the area .
all right , yeah , e @-@ mail maura and jane this stuff on white .
i &apos;m gonna start the paperwork on a search warrant .
maybe we &apos;ll have better luck at his apartment .
there once was a man from kent ,
whose name , in fact , was kent .
mm , ceiling is eating kent . good .
be happy i &apos;m not wearing the kilt today .
he &apos;s fixing the exhaust fan .
what about a call to maintenance ?
oh , that would take a month . besides , this satisfies
the basic male need to fix things .
for your information ,
i once made an air conditioner
of a laptop fan and some ice cubes .
so i &apos;ve got this , okay ?
we &apos;ll see .
look what i found in teddy white &apos;s pocket .
a laser pointer .
and if directed at the camera lens ,
the concentrated beam literally blinds the camera
by destroying the c.c.d. / c.m.o.s. sensor .
so the camera can &apos;t &quot; c @-@ anymore . &quot; get it ?
i &apos;m okay !
ballistics confirmed that collins &apos; gun killed teddy white .
okay .
and all the other bullets came from white &apos;s gun .
and there are no prints on the gun either .
great .
what about the bloody brownie ?
uh , still being processed for d.n.a. ,
but more than likely , it &apos;s otis &apos; .
the hospital tox screen
showed high levels of t.h.c. in his blood .
shocking .
well , all this talk of brownies
makes me realize i haven &apos;t eaten . lunch ?
i can &apos;t . i gotta interview a witness .
but i &apos;ll catch you later .
gotta stop meeting like this .
dr. kaplan , you say the sweetest things .
no , really . someday , we have to meet in my office .
people do it all the time .
they call , they make an appointment ,
they come in and lie on my couch .
come and see for yourself .
i @-@ i like this spot .
it affords you a 360 @-@ degree view of your surroundings ,
and it &apos;s not patrolled by boston cops .
well , you &apos;re a ... doctor .
you should know that sunshine is good for you .
and , you know , it &apos;s ...
not like i see you every tuesday at 10 : 00 , so ...
12 meetings in 5 years
is enough to constitute a professional relationship .
next time in my office .
fine , but i &apos;m not bringing you coffee .
i , uh , read about dr. isles &apos; abduction .
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s why you &apos;re here .
you find it difficult
to see someone you care about in danger ?
well , yeah . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s ...
hard to see a @-@ a strong woman like maura ,
you know , just ...
crippled by fear and anxiety .
it &apos;s ...
she &apos;s starting to lose her confidence .
she &apos;s second @-@ guessing herself .
dr. isles is not my client . you are .
i &apos;m asking about you .
no , i &apos;m fine .
i @-@ i @-@ i am fine .
then why &apos;d you want to see me ?
you know , i remember when you first called me
to come meet you here .
those scars were very new .
yeah , it was , uh ...
right after i caught hoyt .
some wounds heal with stitches and a band @-@ aid .
others require more time .
all of them require a helping hand .
i &apos;m not wounded .
professor gray . i read your smackdown of the hackers
who broke into the s.s.a. computers .
pissed and fighting for the good guys .
i figured the guy who wrote that article
would help me stop someone from hurting
a cop &apos;s family and friends .
what ? oh .
yes , that was absolutely ... horrible .
what is it you wanted me to do again ?
i know how this hacker hides .
i just don &apos;t know how to find him .
the trick is to find that piece of himself
that every hacker leaves in their work .
a signature .
where do i find that ?
if the hacker &apos;s good , you never find it .
and this guy &apos;s good .
professor gray ?
there must be something i can do .
yes . yes , there is . leave this stuff with me .
i thought you said we &apos;d never find his signature .
no , i said you would never find it .
i did not say i couldn &apos;t .
it &apos;s three broken ribs ...
bruised spleen , and some ...
major blunt force trauma .
you feel up to looking at a photo ?
i &apos;ll do whatever i can to help .
you seen him before ?
customer , maybe ? hanging around the parking lot ?
no .
i can &apos;t believe i just opened the door .
i just let him walk right in and --
don &apos;t blame yourself .
i just came by here to thank you .
the surgeon said getting otis to the hospital when they did
saved his life .
you saved his life , jeff .
i didn &apos;t mean to interrupt .
i &apos;m christine reynolds , otis &apos;s wife .
sergeant vince korsak , boston homicide .
how is your husband doing ?
still in a coma .
did you work at the pot palace , too ?
yes , i work there .
mostly bookkeeping at home ,
but i work behind the counter two or three days a week .
have you seen anything strange around the store this week ?
someone hanging around outside ?
no .
were there any problems with employees ?
no , we have four ... part @-@ timers
and ... my husband and me , sergeant .
and otis wanted it that way --
a small , owner @-@ operated corner store .
did otis owe anyone money ?
anyone that might have robbed the store to get it back ?
oh , god , no .
do you recognize him ?
i &apos;ve never seen him before .
otis is the most wonderful , peaceful man .
no one would want to hurt him .
oh ! jane , i was just trying to find you .
what &apos;s up ?
no , d--
stay .
now before you get to your desk ,
i just want you to know that , uh ...
martinez .
martinez is here .
hi !
so , to what do i owe the pleasure ?
i mean -- i mean , not ... my pleasure .
i @-@ i mean , everyone &apos;s pleased , i &apos;m sure .
he &apos;s not . um ... but ...
hola .
hi .
mm @-@ kay .
as you all know ,
i &apos;ve been on loan to the d.e.a. task force .
we &apos;ve been working a series of robberies
along the massachusetts border .
small crew hitting
small town , mom @-@ and @-@ pop medical marijuana operations .
makes sense . small towns , small police departments .
they don &apos;t have the personnel
to handle that kind of operation .
you think your crew hit the pot palace ?
possibly . two masked man enter near closing time
when there were no customers ,
grabbing the cash and the marijuana on display .
our guys were in and out in 35 seconds .
can we tie teddy white to these crimes ?
not yet .
this is where we thought they would hit next . nina ?
a small dispensary in wellesley , right off route 9 .
d.e.a. &apos; s already set up on the place .
you guys want in ?
dude , what if i smoke this all up and i don &apos;t like it ?
is there , like , some kind of refund policy ?
sure is , dude .
just return the smoke in this jar ,
and we &apos;ll totally give you a refund .
that &apos;s really cool , dude .
far out , right ?
‭ yeah !
yeah , right on , man .
note to self -- i hate retail .
you look tired .
well , sitting in a car watching nothing is boring .
you know , i heard about what happened .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m all right . i &apos;m just tired .
i &apos;ve been sleeping on maura &apos;s couch ,
trying to keep an eye on things .
wouldn &apos;t surveillance cameras be easier ?
yes , but there &apos;s a hacker involved ,
and i &apos;m worried about him stealing the signal , so ...
you talking to anyone ?
you can &apos;t be serious .
hey , why not ?
after that incident in dorchester ,
i saw a therapist for a few months .
i was having pretty bad dreams .
i know . i remember .
so ?
in my dream ,
i chase a killer into a @-@ a crowd of people .
but i can &apos;t see any faces .
i @-@ i can &apos;t see who &apos;s good or who &apos;s bad ,
and i just keep spinning .
and i just keep circling , and ...
and then , i @-@ i don &apos;t see the knife until it &apos;s too late .
and then i wake up .
what do you think it means ?
in the dream , if ...
i just had a little more time ...
you know ? like , i @-@ i could see his face . i could catch him .
but he &apos;s always just out of reach .
it &apos;s ...
maybe you need to let someone else carry the ball for a while .
my family is in danger .
you know this guy isn &apos;t gonna stop .
then i guess you &apos;re gonna have to find him .
get ready . they &apos;re here .
boston police . drop it or die .
your partner &apos;s dead .
what the hell ? when did that happen ?
the night you hit the pot palace .
wanna explain the gun in your waistband ?
i found that . i didn &apos;t want some kid to pick it up .
you &apos;re a nice guy , helping out the community like that .
that &apos;s why i gave my friend a ride to the store .
do you know just being a lookout is felony murder ?
do you know that ?
life in prison , no parole .
look ...
i don &apos;t know what happened , okay , in that store ,
but i @-@ i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t hurt anybody .
i &apos;m a thief . a thief . not a killer , all right ?
you tell us what happened inside of pot palace .
we talk to the d.a. , maybe they knock it down to accessory .
i wasn &apos;t in the pot palace . i &apos;ve never been there .
where were you last night around midnight ?
in brockton ,
at the motel 24 with todd .
brockton .
this little place called , uh , uh , 24 motel .
uh , wally and i , we were there all night .
we ordered some pizza , had a little party with some girls .
what are their names ?
jasmine and , um ...
ah . cinnamon .
yeah , cinnamon .
cinnamon .
you okay ?
yeah , i just need to get some sleep .
for , like , a week or two .
you should let me take ma home tonight .
all right , spill the beans . what &apos;s going on ?
she &apos;s been taking our mother home every night after her shift .
well , no wonder you &apos;re so tired .
you can &apos;t burn your candle at both ends like that .
that &apos;s what i told her .
do you have any useful information ,
or are you just trolling the halls , causing problems ?
wally johnson and todd davis &apos; phone records .
they were in the area of all of the out @-@ of @-@ state robberies .
but not the pot palace ?
i went to brockton this morning .
wally and todd checked into the motel 24
the night of the robbery ,
left the next morning .
pizza delivery guy i.d. &apos; d &apos; em from their photos .
so the pot palace wasn &apos;t them .
lieutenant martinez left this for you at the front desk .
thank you .
睡个好觉
hey , baby .
hi , ma .
what &apos;s that ?
wireless cameras .
paid for by the d.e.a.
don &apos;t touch .
n.s.a. crypto technology prevents anyone from intercepting the signal .
oh . does that mean you &apos;re gonna start sleeping ?
or are you going to watch cameras all night long ?
when i &apos;m not watching , someone else will .
who ?
what ?
jane , this has got to stop .
you are not responsible for me or maura .
okay , this is about someone who is trying to hurt ,
potentially kill , the people that i love .
someone that i &apos;m in charge of finding . okay ?
but for all we know , whoever was behind this
could &apos;ve been scared off when joe harris died .
what if he wasn &apos;t ?
as requested , a random sampling of product from the pot palace .
for investigatory purposes only .
i never doubted it .
you say this has to do with some inconsistency ?
well , the government @-@ sanctioned suppliers are required by law
to maintain a specific level of t.h.c. in all their products .
yet , the bloody brownie i was testing for d.n.a.
had a significantly higher level of t.h.c. than allowed .
meaning what ?
otis was selling non @-@ sanctioned products in his store ?
well , the discrepancy could be an aberration
in the manufacturing process .
i &apos;ll know for sure once i test the t.h.c. levels
in these samples .
when you say &quot; test , &quot;
uh , exactly how do you do that ?
well , we do burn it in a controlled environment
with proper ventilation .
it &apos;s all very scientific , i promise .
anything new on wally and todd ?
well , no , we have found no connection
between wally and todd and teddy white .
maybe it &apos;s a copycat .
yeah .
but how does a two @-@ bit loser
who can barely plan a subway ride know how
to disable a security camera with a laser pointer ?
did we find any connection
between teddy white and the employees at the store ?
not yet , but nina &apos;s still working on it .
we gotta find an accomplice .
hey , maura , what &apos;s up ?
no , i do not have prince albert in a can .
yes , my refrigerator is running .
where are you ?
are you in the lab ?
y @-@ you know , if you could just stop with the laughing , i ...
why can you not trust atoms ?
because they make up everything .
you &apos;ve got the fan pushing the smoke in .
you wired the fan wrong .
you wired the fan bong !
you know , just interesting fact --
that might be the biggest bong in history .
okay . let &apos;s go .
get up ! get up , get up .
get up ! get up !
get out ! get out !
oh ! i &apos;m over here .
the tests that i &apos;ve been running on the edibles ...
mm @-@ hmm . oh , i &apos;m so hungry !
what are you doing ?
looking for corn curls .
in my hair ?
yeah .
corn curls in your curls !
maura ... focus .
okay ?
okay .
tell me about ... hmm .
the tests on the edibles .
on the edibles . mm @-@ hmm .
oh , yeah !
some of otis &apos; brownies
did not come from his government supplier .
he was gettin &apos; some m.j. from the street .
word .
i can &apos;t . just ...
oh , you know , i have never told you this before ...
oh , god .
but i love
glazed doughnuts .
okay ! i &apos;ll ...
i will get you some .
oh , hey , hey , hey . shh ! shh ! shh !
nina , can you send the phone records
from otis and the pot palace over to martinez , please ?
thanks so much ! bye !
do you know what a scientist plants in his garden ?
no .
a chemistree ! a chemistree !
so how &apos;s the 420 gang doing ?
fine , once i got &apos; em six bags of chips and some fresh air .
okay , so it &apos;s pretty obvious from maura &apos;s report
that otis is supplementing his brownie inventory .
it &apos;s a good plan .
sell your own home @-@ baked brownies ,
cut the government out of it , pocket a bunch of tax @-@ free cash .
yeah , all he &apos;d need is a street dealer .
and for someone who sells legal marijuana for a living ,
how hard could that be to find ?
if otis was stupid enough to burn someone in a deal ,
it wouldn &apos;t surprise me if that robbery was staged .
otis is killed , the dispute is resolved ,
and it doesn &apos;t kick back on the dealer .
i sent the pot palace phone records
to martinez and the d.e.a. like you asked .
he cross @-@ referenced them
against their database of suspected dealers .
they got a hit .
i have never seen an operation this big in boston .
say thanks to the modern marvel of advanced hydroponics .
you &apos;re mixing up the sativa and the indica with the hybrids .
who &apos;s in charge here ?
we are .
all right , well , you --
can you tell me what the hell is going on here ?
because you &apos;re taking , like , all of my product .
well , it &apos;s illegal to grow and sell marijuana .
not anymore .
it &apos;s legal in the state of massachusetts .
if you have a grower &apos;s permit .
do you have yours handy , charlie ?
no , i -- look , i got a friend . he was gonna get it to me .
okay , you know what ?
no one cares about your weed , all right ?
you can discuss that with the d.e.a.
all i care about is murder .
murder ?
was the robbery at the pot palace
a setup to kill otis reynolds ?
wait , wait . what are you talking about ?
you killing otis reynolds
because he stiffed you on a deal .
god , no .
if somebody stiffed me , i just --
i @-@ i wouldn &apos;t sell to them again .
well , that &apos;s big of you .
hey , look around ,
i &apos;ve got plenty of product to cover a loss .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m gonna kill somebody over it .
you sure of that ?
look at me , bro . i mean , do i look like pablo escobar ?
i mean ...
anyway , it &apos;s not -- not the way it was with otis .
he was -- he was a solid customer .
when &apos;s the last time you saw him ?
15 years ago .
otis and i did a little business together
when we were in college .
and then , you know , we drifted apart .
but he called me , like , five months ago .
how did he get your number ?
this is the house i grew up in .
and so , like , the number &apos;s not changed .
and otis called &apos; cause
he wanted to do me business together again .
but he didn &apos;t want to meet face @-@ to @-@ face ,
so he just left the money at the drop @-@ off ,
and i dropped off , you know , the package . legally .
i &apos;m gonna look around .
yeah .
can we trust you with this ?
considering my body weight
and the fact that i am not a regular marijuana smoker ,
i do believe that the effects
of the inhalation event have passed .
and given my lack
of a genetic predisposition to addiction ,
i don &apos;t have any overwhelming desire
to smoke marijuana again .
but i &apos;m not so sure about kent .
he did seem to enjoy the effects .
oh , yeah . no , you are the picture of decorum .
okay , can you test that , please ,
and see if that &apos;s the same marijuana
that we found in the illegal brownies ?
well , if i can extract plant d.n.a.
from the illegal brownies , then i can compare the two .
if not , all i can test is the same t.h.c. levels .
and that won &apos;t prove conclusively
that the samples are the same .
angela told me about the cameras .
yeah ?
i don &apos;t want them in my house . i don &apos;t want to be watched .
okay , maura , the cameras aren &apos;t --
jane , stop worrying about us .
it &apos;s unhealthy .
is it as unhealthy as being kidnapped ?
or killed ?
my therapist showed me something . it might help you .
oh , i can hardly wait .
the glass is life .
the rocks are the bad things that happen .
it looks like there &apos;s no room left in the glass ,
but ...
the water
is the good things in life .
and you --we-- need to focus on the good things .
what if somebody takes your glass ?
is it a bad thing that i &apos;m being security @-@ conscious
after everything that &apos;s happened ?
maura and your mother aren &apos;t cops , jane .
they don &apos;t think they way we do . it &apos;s just the way it is .
oh , speaking of your mother ...
what ?
did she ask you to say something to me ? what ?
no , no , no , not at all .
i was just gonna say i &apos;m at the robber most nights .
i can give angela a ride home .
she didn &apos;t put you up to this ?
on my dogs . it &apos;s just my way of watching your back .
thank you .
listen , when you drop her off ,
you just gonna take a look around --
i got your back .
okay .
got the list of everything charlie douglas sold to otis .
from what he bought ,
otis could &apos;ve baked enough pot brownies to net
at least $ 250,000 tax @-@ free .
did you find an extra 250 grand in the pot palace safe ?
nope , all the money in the safe
balanced with the business receipts .
but the records do show a drop in sales
if they &apos;re legit brownies .
which is what we &apos;d expect if otis was pushing his product
instead of the government &apos;s .
well , otis owned one of only six dispensaries in boston .
that &apos;s worth millions of dollars even after he paid taxes .
yeah , so why do something that would cost you your license
or end you up in jail ?
is it possible that otis wasn &apos;t the one
goosing the inventory ?
i mean , charlie said that he hadn &apos;t seen him in years .
and otis wouldn &apos;t meet with him face @-@ to @-@ face this time .
you thinking an employee pretending to be otis
picked up some brownies
and sold &apos; em at the pot palace on his own ?
maybe otis found out , was gonna turn them in .
that &apos;s certainly motive to want him dead .
anything yet ?
no , nothing we don &apos;t already know .
otis did a great job running background checks
on these people before he hired them .
thank you .
it looks like all of the employees are clean .
no new purchases , no investment accounts .
jane told us to run checks on all the employees , right ?
she did .
well , the wife , christine , is also a part @-@ time employee .
christine reynolds had one credit card ,
but it &apos;s been paid off .
account &apos;s been closed since the pot palace opened .
looks like they pay cash for everything now .
what was christine &apos;s maiden name ?
johnson .
okay .
there it is , at the same bank .
a holiday account for a christine johnson .
the account also comes with a free safe deposit box .
$ 240,000 .
uniforms picked christine up at her house .
they &apos;re bringing her in .
so she was sneaking in the illegal brownies
and selling &apos; em right under her husband &apos;s nose .
it appears so .
why would she steal from her husband ?
maybe she was leaving him .
even though his name was the only one on the license ,
wouldn &apos;t she still have a stake in the profits
if they got divorced ?
in an ongoing business ,
her stake would be less than half , if that .
best she could hope for is a decent alimony settlement .
but in an all @-@ cash business , otis could play with the books ,
cut her out of thousands of dollars .
she didn &apos;t come up with this on her own .
someone pretended to be otis
when they were talking to charlie .
and this ...
this is her protection against otis being pissed
because she wasn &apos;t just leaving him ,
she was having an affair .
we didn &apos;t find a burner phone
when we searched her house and her car .
no e @-@ mails or love letters on her computer .
most of the calls from her cell phone
were to and from the pot palace .
and there &apos;s no connection between christine
and teddy white or any of his known associates .
we don &apos;t even know whether it was a robbery
or an attempt to kill otis .
let &apos;s ask her .
did otis know you were stealing from him ?
is that why you staged the robbery ?
or did he find out about the affair you were having ?
the two of you decided to kill otis
so you could start a new life , didn &apos;t you ?
i would never hurt otis .
i may not love him anymore , but i would never hurt him .
oh , sure you would , especially if you found out
that he was trying to cut you out of your share of the store .
the store was otis &apos;s dream , not mine .
i don &apos;t want part of the store .
you expect us to believe that ?
it &apos;s the truth .
then why were you stealing from him ?
the money ...
was just to get away ,
start a new life .
with who ?
yeah , and run the employee records against the schedule , okay ?
thanks .
what &apos;s up ?
uh , so , just wanna let you know
that we &apos;ve tied johnson and davis
to all the other dispensary robberies .
but not the pot palace ?
no .
so you haven &apos;t helped me at all with my murder investigation .
you sleeping any better ?
mm , no .
but thanks for asking .
maura &apos;s allergic to surveillance .
my money &apos;s on you , jane .
call me if you &apos;re up in the middle of the night .
especially if you &apos;re up in the middle of the night .
i &apos;m not gonna do that .
i wish you would .
you &apos;re the best , kiddo .
thanks .
what &apos;d you find ?
i ran the schedules of the employees ,
and you were right .
christine didn &apos;t need to call her boyfriend
&apos;cause she saw him all the time .
her schedule overlaps a lot with jeff collins , the guard .
most of their days off match .
and the number of calls from the pot palace
to the reynolds &apos; home were higher
when otis was working than when he wasn &apos;t .
they also correspond to the days that collins was working .
how much you wanna bet he was calling her
right under otis &apos; nose ?
and ...
yes ? something else ? mm @-@ hmm .
i couldn &apos;t find a connection
between christine and teddy white ,
so i took another look at jeff collins .
right here .
they went to the same gym .
where &apos;s jane ?
uh , she &apos;s a little tied up , asked me to get the results .
well , uh , there is a significant quantity of gunshot residue
on the inside of the right and left sleeves .
is the gunpowder the same ?
the g.s.r. on both sleeves has the same chemical signature
as the gunpowder from teddy white &apos;s weapon .
yeah , same as when i ran the first test .
if he held a gun like this , shot himself ,
that would explain how gunshot residue
got on both sleeves , right ?
yes , or he could &apos;ve been involved in a scuffle
with teddy white , like he said he was .
jane thinks jeff collins shot himself .
staged the whole thing to look like a hero ,
take the suspicion off himself .
well , i know you don &apos;t want to hear this ,
but there is no science to confirm that theory .
the only thing i want to confirm right now
is whether or not christine knew
that collins was gonna shoot otis .
your boyfriend jeff shot and killed teddy white ,
and he shot your husband in the head .
i don &apos;t believe you .
you &apos;re just trying to blame him for the robbery
because you can &apos;t solve it .
you were in the hospital room
when jeff said he didn &apos;t know teddy white , remember ?
jeff would never ...
think about it .
he was obsessed with how much money
otis was making at the dispensary , wasn &apos;t he ?
and it was his idea to sell the brownies , wasn &apos;t it ?
and he &apos;s the one who called charlie douglas
pretending to be otis , wasn &apos;t he ?
did he tell you how screwed you were gonna get ?
did he tell you how otis would end up with the entire store ,
and you &apos;d get stiffed on the alimony ?
did he tell you any of that ?
no , no .
jeff would never hurt otis .
okay .
she just can &apos;t accept that jeff set this all up .
you think she was in on it ?
i think she loves jeff ,
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;d be in on a plan to kill otis .
okay , thanks .
jeff collins was released from the hospital this morning .
i have a unit standing by otis &apos;s room .
i checked . collins has three handguns
and two rifles registered to him .
might not be the kind of guy
to take our suspicions lying down .
i know that you don &apos;t wanna believe
that your boyfriend shot and killed your husband .
he wouldn &apos;t .
okay , well , help me prove that .
call jeff and tell him
that otis is gonna make a full recovery .
we moved him , jeff , put the rifle down .
do it the easy way . put the gun down .
i can &apos;t believe she set me up .
christine didn &apos;t set you up .
she just couldn &apos;t believe you &apos;re a murderer .
tell christine i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve never used one of these things before .
this is great !
i mean , is he all right ?
yeah , he &apos;s all right .
i swear , jane , this is the last time i &apos;m gonna show up
unless you have something to say .
you said that last time .
i &apos;m afraid .
now we &apos;re gettin &apos; somewhere .
i &apos;m sorry i took your rocks .
they weren &apos;t really my rocks .
they belong to the commonwealth of massachusetts .
i gave them to korsak for his turtles .
he is so busted .
i still have the glass .
i shouldn &apos;t have played amateur psychiatrist .
it was wrong of me .
it was fine .
i &apos;m only watching you two
because i &apos;m afraid that i can &apos;t catch this guy .
i mean , he &apos;s been ahead of me every step of the way .
what if i &apos;m just not good enough to catch him ?
but what if you are ?
