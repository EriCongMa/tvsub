lynette found that dating tom &apos;s boss
if i asked you to have tom work a few nights this week ,
you &apos;d do it ?
you just say the word .
... had its advantages .
i &apos;m sending tom to mumbai for a year .
julie made a big decision about her baby .
i &apos;m gonna keep her .
and the baby &apos;s father made a commitment .
i &apos;ll get a job . i &apos;ll take--i &apos;ll take classes .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes .
carlos .
carlos and gaby argued ...
i am not gonna let bree
take the fall for a crime i committed .
... after bree was arrested for murder .
this is one of those times where the best things you can do
is do nothing .
but bree &apos;s attorney was confident ...
did you , uh , have some new thoughts on the case ?
why don &apos;t we discuss them over dinner ?
... as well as convincing .
since bree van de kamp was arrested ,
she had experienced a wide range of emotions .
one moment , she felt afraid .
the next , she was angry .
and through it all , she felt ashamed .
but now that her trial was approaching ,
she was beginning to feel ...
a little rattled .
bree , are you okay ?
yeah . just all this witness preparation
is making me nervous .
gaby &apos;s been in there for ages .
trip &apos;s very thorough .
he just wants to make sure we &apos;re all ready .
there you are . that took a while .
no kidding .
i haven &apos;t been grilled like that
since carlos got my last credit card bill .
well , as alibi witnesses ,
you &apos;re gonna be asked about every detail of the night
that ramon disappeared .
and we can &apos;t afford any slip @-@ ups .
so ... how many dinner guests were there that night ?
14 .
what color dress was bree wearing ?
red .
what sauce did she serve with the chicken ?
oh . i got this .
barbecue ?
gaby , of all the things i &apos;ve been accused of ,
the idea that i would serve barbecue sauce
at a dinner party !
oh , you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
that sounds way worse than saying you killed alejandro .
wait . uh ... who &apos;s alejandro ?
uh , my gardener .
i &apos;m always getting ... my mexicans confused ...
which i &apos;m allowed to do , because i &apos;m mexican .
i gotta run . you , uh , you gonna be all right ?
of course . with you in my corner ,
how can i not be ?
okay . what was that little prom photo moment
with the hands ?
we warned you about this .
you &apos;re still going after him , aren &apos;t you ?
of course not . i am totally focused on the case ,
and so is he .
okay , fine . what am i supposed to do ?
he is the most intelligent , caring , charming man
i have met in ages .
and by the way , it isn &apos;t exactly a one @-@ way street .
he &apos;s been showing quite a bit of interesting in me , too .
um , bree-- and besides , if i reject him ,
he might be too humiliated
to do a good job on my case .
yeah ?
something tells me he &apos;s gonna bounce back .
yes , after bree van de kamp was arrested ,
she felt a range of emotions .
but the one thing she didn &apos;t expect to feel ...
was jealousy .
at the fairview childbirth center ,
there are certain conversations you expect to hear ...
discussions about the magic of a changing body ...
look at me . i &apos;m a cow .
the beauty of natural childbirth .
just so you know , i &apos;m getting the drugs .
or the importance of healthy nutrition .
take a chip , lose a hand .
but julie meyer found herself having a conversation ...
i can &apos;t believe bree &apos;s on trial for murder .
i mean , come on . killers don &apos;t wear aprons .
that was rather unexpected .
i know . it sucks .
you know what else sucks ?
somebody trying to relax you
by talking about a murder .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
so what would be a good thing for you to visualize
that might help relax you ?
me punching porter in the face for being late .
okay . forget visualization . how about we try
some of that breathing stuff again ?
ugh . no . i hate that &quot; hee @-@ hee @-@ hee . &quot;
feels stupid .
i know . but it works .
relaxes you when you start to get stressed out .
okay , nice job , everyone .
we &apos;re gonna show the birthing dvd now .
julie , sorry , sorry , sorry .
i had to clean out the fryer before i could leave .
no worries . plus you smell like french fries .
i love french fries .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re about to go through ...
you missed , like , the whole class .
she did great . let me tell you ,
this girl can visualize .
i planned on getting out early , but a shift opened up ,
and i had to take it . what do you want me to say ?
i want you to say that you &apos;ll be on time
for one thing we do as we get ready to have this baby .
&quot; hee @-@ hee @-@ hee @-@ hee . &quot;
it &apos;s not funny , mrs. delfino .
look . i said i &apos;m sorry .
the point is , i &apos;m here now ,
and i &apos;m 100 % focused and ready to help .
just stay calm .
... the crowning begins ,
and the head of the baby becomes visible .
hello . this is bree van de kamp .
may i please speak with trip ?
was he having lunch alone ?
oh , right . the blonde woman with the convertible .
i see . right .
thank you .
okay , i know there &apos;s been a lot of talk
about what you should wear to the trial ,
so i &apos;ve selected a few outfits that just scream &quot; acquittal . &quot;
what do you think ?
black and white stripes ?
oh , good point . don &apos;t need to put an idea in the jury &apos;s mind .
how about ruffles ? i read somewhere
that no one has ever been convicted while wearing ruffles .
okay . you &apos;re right .
there &apos;s always a first time . to hell with ruffles .
how about this one ?
it &apos;s lovely , but i am being accused of
sleeping with a total stranger and killing him .
and red is the color of blood and whores . got it .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll find something else .
bree , something wrong ?
apart from me standing trial for murder in three days , no .
life is good .
relax . it &apos;s gonna be okay .
and remember , you &apos;re actually innocent .
juries can sense things like that .
i hope you &apos;re right .
of course i am .
and trip &apos;s a brilliant lawyer .
he &apos;s gonna get you off in no time .
i &apos;m just worried that he &apos;s been a little distracted lately .
he seems fine to me .
i have some other dresses in the back .
let me bring &apos; em out for you .
it &apos;s gonna turn out fine , bree .
honestly , i &apos;m not worried at all .
india ?
not india .
he said he &apos;s going to mumbai .
that &apos;s in india , you idiot .
how long are you gonna be gone ?
a year .
what ? dad , you &apos;re gonna miss my eighth grade graduation .
it won &apos;t be so bad . we can send him pictures .
we can skype .
so he &apos;s supposed to teach me to drive over the computer ?
and he &apos;s gonna miss the birth of my baby .
i am sorry , guys . look , i talked to my boss .
he &apos;s not changing his mind . there &apos;s nothing i can do .
besides , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s just for a year .
it &apos;ll go by like that .
daddy , no !
i don &apos;t want you to go .
i know . i love you so much , baby .
guys , could i have a minute alone with your dad ?
yeah , sure .
guys , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
we &apos;re gonna get through this !
i don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gonna get through this .
so how did jane take the news ?
um , timing could &apos;ve been better .
we &apos;re not exactly in a good place right now .
well , maybe some time apart will do you good .
maybe .
it &apos;s gonna be ...
really weird being so far away .
i know . it &apos;s gonna be so hard on the kids .
actually , i was talking about you .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ve ever been apart for more than a month .
who &apos;s gonna tell me what to do ? what to think ?
whether your shoes are on the right feet .
exactly .
i &apos;m really gonna miss you .
i &apos;m ...
so sorry .
why ?
there &apos;s nothing you can do about it .
hello .
are you looking for trip ?
yes .
well , he &apos;s meeting with the judge on my case .
i &apos;ll wait for him .
so how exactly do you know trip ?
he ... hires me from time to time .
and what is the nature of your work ?
i really can &apos;t say .
discretion &apos;s an important part of my job .
oh . i see . well , part of your discretion
is falling out of your blouse .
excuse me ?
look , this is mr. weston &apos;s place of business .
maybe you should meet him in your place of business--
perhaps a seedy motel room or a street corner .
are you calling me a hooker ?
well , if the push @-@ up bra fits , or in your case , doesn &apos;t ...
that &apos;s it . screw you , lady .
tell trip i &apos;m off his case .
lindsay . lindsay .
trip ?
what the hell ?
uh , she wanted me to tell you that she &apos;s off the case .
what was she doing on the case ?
she &apos;s a private investigator
who was working on a really big lead for us .
wh @-@ why did she quit ?
no idea .
i &apos;d better go talk to her .
no ! i mean , you know how careful you have to be with some women .
they can misinterpret the littlest things .
i &apos;ll talk to her .
so what do you think , maid of honor ?
nice .
you do realize you &apos;re gonna have to wear this ... in public ?
you got a problem with it ?
no . it &apos;s just ... the purple is such a ... bold choice .
aren &apos;t you afraid it &apos;s gonna pull focus from the bride ?
and the sky and the earth ?
lee , look at my wedding dress .
all of this wearing all of that--
santa claus in a thong riding a unicorn
would not be able to pull focus from me .
lynette , you okay ? you seem a little dstracted .
i think she &apos;s still in shock .
no , it &apos;s just ... this whole thing with tom .
oh , lynette , it &apos;s gonna be fine .
my dad traveled all the time . my siblings and i adjusted .
yeah , but he said he was gonna miss me .
really ? suddenly i &apos;m interested . that &apos;s great .
and it was the way he said it , too , like ...
he &apos;d been kind of missing me already .
well , what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s no way i can let him get on that plane to mumbai .
or eat these if you &apos;re going to fit in that dress .
lindsay ! hi .
i think we got off on the wrong foot earlier .
keep walking .
i suppose i deserve that ,
but if i could just have a--
i &apos;m on surveillance ! stay down .
ooh , how exciting . what are we surveilling ?
well , nothing now .
i &apos;ve been waiting six weeks for that cheating bastard
to leave his curtains open .
i &apos;m sorry .
trip told me where to find you ,
because i wanted to apologize for my unkind words .
you were merely doing your job , and i was very rude .
well , you were more than rude .
yes , i was also off @-@ color .
i never should have ... implied you &apos;re a hooker
or insulted your bosoms .
they &apos;re lovely .
no .
not that . you like him .
you thought i was sleeping with him ,
and you got jealous .
i &apos;m not jealous of you and trip .
is there a &quot; you and trip &quot; ?
oh , god , no . he &apos;s , like , 100 .
look , i &apos;ll come back to your case ,
and i &apos;ll give you a free pass on the crazy jealousy .
it &apos;s not all your fault .
what do you mean ? trip &apos;s a good lawyer .
he listens carefully .
he tells you he &apos;ll protect you .
female clients are always getting the wrong idea .
well , that might be the way it normally goes ,
but i happen to believe there really is something
between trip and me .
sorry , but i know him . he &apos;s all about the job .
he &apos;s into your case , not you .
porter is going to be fine . trust me .
oh , sure . he &apos;ll just wear a helmet
so he doesn &apos;t crack his head open
when his head hits the delivery room floor .
baby , i &apos;m telling you ,
when the man gets in there with you ,
it just clicks .
they see the blood and stuff ,
and it starts to seem like a video game to them .
i &apos;m getting a bad feeling about this .
okay , you know what ?
mike almost passed out when he saw that video .
and he was a little shaky in the delivery room , too .
but once m.j. was born ,
he was my rock .
m.j. took his first step right there .
we were so excited .
then he took his second step right there .
fell right on his face .
he was ... bleeding and ...
i was a mess .
and mike knew exactly what to do .
he always did .
oh , mom .
i &apos;m okay .
just so many memories of him here .
anyway ...
the point is ...
you shouldn &apos;t worry about porter .
i just ...
i think that he &apos;s not into this anymore .
that he &apos;s losing interest in being a dad .
he was late for class because of work .
you gotta cut him some slack .
it &apos;s not just that .
he &apos;s missed some doctor &apos;s appointments ,
and he missed the tour of the birthing room at the hospital .
we had a deal .
he was supposed to help raise the baby so that i could finish school .
but now i &apos;m afraid that
it &apos;s all falling apart .
that was delicious .
i &apos;m glad you liked it .
more wine ?
lynette , it &apos;s our third date .
i &apos;m pretty much a sure thing .
something wrong ? you &apos;re acting a little weird .
yeah , there &apos;s ...
i have a little favor to ask you .
please , don &apos;t send tom to mumbai .
you have a very odd sense of foreplay .
i know . it &apos;s just ...
the kids are upset , and tom is a wreck ,
and i don &apos;t think i can go through with it .
okay .
really ?
yeah . i didn &apos;t want him to go . i was just doing it for you .
i &apos;ll send mcguinness instead .
that son of a bitch had the nerve
to beat me in tennis last week .
oh . thank you .
i am so grateful .
i can think of one way
that you can show your gratitude .
um , maybe you &apos;re the one who needs another glass of wine .
gregg . no .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
i just ... i &apos;m not ready for that step ,
and i don &apos;t know that i ever will be .
ever ?
i &apos;m sorry . there &apos;s ... someone else .
you just realized that ?
no . no , i just realized how much i want it to work .
so let me get this straight .
you use me to get back at your ex ,
and now you &apos;re dumping me for some other guy ?
that &apos;s unbelievable !
unbelievable .
and in local news .
the trial of bree van de kamp is set to begin tomorrow .
van de kamp is accused of killing ramon sanchez ,
whose body was discovered
beneath a condominium development in chapman woods .
couldn &apos;t sleep ?
no .
thought i &apos;d take a walk .
remember the last time we were up this late together ?
the night we buried alejandro .
god , if we could only go back .
you having trouble sleeping , too ?
no , i woke up to get some water ,
and i saw you from the window .
what are you guys doing up ?
we can &apos;t sleep because our friend is going on trial
tomorrow morning for murder .
oh , relax . bree &apos;s innocent .
the jury &apos;s gonna see that .
juries make mistakes .
well , you know , it doesn &apos;t help bree
for us to be negative right now .
do you know what i was thinking we should do to help her ?
go to the judge and tell her the truth .
i was thinking the exact same thing .
wait a minute . what &apos;s going on here ?
what , it never even crossed your mind ?
well , we have a plan in place ,
and if we just hold on a little longer ,
everything will be back to normal .
and what if bree is convicted , huh ?
what are we gonna do then ?
i don &apos;t know .
clearly . do you even care ?
lynette !
it &apos;s late .
well , let &apos;s just talk about it tomorrow .
well , i don &apos;t get this . why are you guys mad at me ?
because you &apos;re not having any trouble sleeping .
don &apos;t freak out . it &apos;s just me .
trip , what are you doing here ? it &apos;s the middle of the night .
i had a feeling you might be up .
do we need to discuss my case ?
nope . just the opposite .
doughnuts ... &quot; casablanca . &quot;
that &apos;s one of my favorite movies .
yours , too ?
never seen it .
i &apos;m , uh , more a &quot; caddyshack &quot; kind of guy .
but i had a feeling about you .
may i ?
sure .
my trial starts in six hours .
is this really what we should be doing ?
do you know anything about sports ?
no more than i have to .
this is just like going to the championships .
you practice your ass off to get there ,
but the night before the big game ,
you just forget about it .
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m going through this .
but if i have to ...
i guess what i &apos;m saying is ,
of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world ,
i &apos;m glad you walked into mine .
am i supposed to know what that means ?
start the movie .
thank you .
in the matter of people vs. bree van de kamp ,
we are here for opening statements .
ms. stone , you may proceed .
how well do we really know our friends and neighbors ?
they borrow our lawn mowers ,
sit with us in p.t.a. meetings ,
bring us tuna casseroles .
but as this case will demonstrate ,
they also have secrets--
secrets they keep from their neighbors ,
secrets that can poison a place like wisteria lane .
ms. stone wonders how well we know our neighbors .
well , in this case , as it turns out ,
pretty darn well .
breen van de kamp &apos;s friends will tell you
that she is a woman of honesty , integrity , and compassion .
breen van de kamp is an alcoholic ,
a woman of loose morals .
she would pick up strange men in bars ,
have sex with them ,
frequently waking up with no recollection of what happened .
if picking up people in bars is a crime ,
there might be a criminal or two in this very courtroom .
the defendant lured ramon sanchez into her house ,
seduced him , and bludgeoned him .
there is no connection whatsoever
between my client and mr. sanchez .
and while it isn &apos;t against the law to sleep with any man who &apos;d buy you a martini ,
it is illegal to kill them .
has bree made some questionable choices ?
yes .
does that make her a killer ?
no .
it makes her human ... like the rest of us .
this is a case about a woman who led a secret life ,
but here &apos;s the thing about secrets .
like bodies , they don &apos;t always stay buried .
welcome to big top burger .
i &apos;m looking for porter scavo .
is he done yet ?
no , porter &apos;s working the drive @-@ thru .
i thought he was only working till 1 : 00 .
well , i heard him say he &apos;d cover the afternoon shift ,
so that &apos;s till 6 : 00 .
now can i get you something to eat ?
no , i think i &apos;ll get something to go .
welcome to big top burger . can i help you ?
i &apos;ve got a better idea .
how about you help the mother of your child ?
mrs. delfino ?
dear god . is there another person
who could say what i just said to you ?
no , of course not .
porter , why are you making julie
do all of this stuff without you ?
i &apos;m busting my butt trying to make money for her and the baby .
i &apos;m working three jobs .
well , then tell her that .
she &apos;s worried that you &apos;re losing interest in being a dad .
i &apos;m talking to the clown ! shut up !
can you please pull up to the window ?
look , mrs. delfino ,
i barely graduated high school ,
i ditched college , and this is about as much
as my baby &apos;s daddy is gonna achieve .
you can always go back to college .
when ?
everybody says how expensive it is to have a kid .
with the crap money i make , i &apos;ll be working all the time .
look , i get it .
it &apos;s just not right for julie to do this without you .
i totally agree . julie &apos;s given up so much
so i can be in this kid &apos;s life .
but i &apos;m starting to realize ... that was a bad trade for her .
look at her , a regular black widow .
it says here she slept with 15 guys in a 2 @-@ month period .
and she was drunk the whole time .
sounds like college .
excuse me . but you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
do you even know this woman ?
actually , a friend of mine used her to cater a party once .
said she had shifty eyes .
they do look pretty shifty .
w @-@ well , i do know her , and she &apos;s innocent .
yeah , i don &apos;t think the police go around
arresting innocent people .
she must have done something .
oh , so you guys read one article ,
and just like that , she &apos;s guilty ?
it &apos;s not just us . everyone says she killed the guy .
she &apos;s the last person in this world who would kill somebody .
she &apos;s a friend and a mother
and probably the most decent person i know .
and she would die if she knew
how people are talking about her .
well , she better get used to it .
if i &apos;m a juror , she &apos;s going away for a long , long time .
and with every exhale ,
the tension is being blown out ,
and every inhale brings in positive energy .
now you &apos;re imagining a peaceful scene--
that beautiful lawn by the science building at your college .
and you &apos;re walking towards the chemistry lab
to finish the research for your dissertation .
and now on that same lawn , a graduation ceremony
in which you are finally receiving your phd .
mom , what are you doing ?
the other day , you were talking about a murder trial ,
and now you &apos;re talking about stuff that will never happen .
i think it will .
how ?
because i am going to move back up there with you
and help raise the baby .
what ?
i &apos;m gonna sell this house , and m.j. and i
are going with you so you can finish your degree .
but ... what about porter ?
well , there will always be a place for him
in his child &apos;s life ,
but porter needs to find his own life right now .
no . i can &apos;t let you do this . you love the lane .
oh , i do , but nowhere near as much as i love you .
and besides ...
i think it &apos;ll be good for me , too .
what do you mean ?
well , i told you , honey . there are memories here
that are just too hard to live with every day .
mom ...
this would be awesome .
but ... are you sure you wanna do this ?
i &apos;m sure .
okay . lay back down .
as mike used to say ,
we gotta practice birthing a baby .
you are gonna love it there , mcguinness .
and hey , if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s only a year .
i &apos;ll give you my &quot; india on 50 rupees a day &quot; book .
all right , people , let &apos;s get started .
thanks again . i am so glad to be staying here .
yeah , well , thank your ex @-@ wife . she &apos;s the one who convinced me .
really ? lynette did that ?
yeah . real piece of work , that one .
i don &apos;t know how you put up with it .
i &apos;m sorry . um ... aren &apos;t you guys dating ?
no . she dumped me .
apparently , she &apos;s hung up on some other guy .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t wanna go to mumbai
just to get away from her crap .
i know . she can be , uh , a bit of a handful .
oh , yeah , that &apos;s why you dumped her ,
&apos;cause she &apos;s a &quot; handful . &quot;
i &apos;m telling you , guys ,
23 years living with that psycho--
he &apos;s either a saint or a masochist .
okay . okay . let &apos;s--let &apos;s start the meeting .
oh , seriously . i barely survived one week
with that ball @-@ buster .
gregg , i &apos;m asking you , drop it .
i &apos;m just saying lynette is a first class bitch .
well , i hope that was worth it ,
&apos;cause you &apos;re fired .
okay , mr. weston ,
is the defense ready to call its first witness ?
we are , your honor . the defense calls susan delfino .
how long have you known my client ?
nearly 20 years .
so it &apos;s fair to say you know each other well ?
we &apos;re like sisters .
she &apos;s the most honest person i &apos;ve ever met .
can you tell us what happened on the night in question ?
it was a progressive dinner party .
i &apos;m sorry . i don &apos;t get out much .
what is a progressive dinner party ?
the whole street throws it .
every house is responsible for a specific course .
oh , sounds like fun .
unless you don &apos;t know how to cook .
they skipped my house that night .
now as you traveled from house to house ,
were you with bree the whole time ?
no .
really ?
where did she go ?
she left my house to go check on her entree .
wouldn &apos;t that have given her time to kill mr. sanchez ?
or have sex with her boyfriend while the chicken burned ,
which is what she was doing when the whole neighborhood
walked in on her .
i imagine that must have been awkward .
clearly , you haven &apos;t spent much time on my street .
and then what happened ?
the party finished at my house ,
and then susan , lynette , and bree stayed late
to help me clean up .
how late ?
around 2 : 00 in the morning .
and the coroner &apos;s report said that the time of death
was between 10 : 00 p.m. and midnight . interesting .
so there &apos;s no possible way
that bree could have killed ramon sanchez that night ?
no way . bree couldn &apos;t hurt a fly .
the only thing she killed that night was the chicken .
no . as god as my witness , bree did not kill him .
that &apos;s it from the car .
my assistant &apos;s gonna pack up the rest of it .
security &apos;s been told not to let me back in the building .
i swear , tom , i am trying to be supportive ,
but i &apos;m having a hard time following this .
why would you hit your boss ?
i just ... never liked him .
so ? there &apos;s lots of people you don &apos;t like .
mr. indich in 3f ,
who never picks up after his dog--
i can &apos;t even get you to write an angry note .
you know what ? i lost my temper .
because he was going to transfer you ?
no .
because he was dating lynette .
oh , my god .
are you still in love with her ?
jane , look , you have to understand . lynette has--
been a part of your life for 23 years . i know .
she &apos;s the mother of your children .
i get it . you &apos;ve given me this speech a hundred times .
now answer the question .
do you still love her ?
yes .
and i was , what ?
some ... wall you built to try and hide that from yourself ?
no .
you were the woman who was there for me
when i was broken and confused ,
and i @-@ i still care about you very much .
no .
tom , you don &apos;t get to break somebody &apos;s heart
and still say you care about them .
if it matters ...
i loved you .
so you recognize this man as well ?
yes . i slept with him , too .
i can imagine how painful this is ,
having to publicly acknowledge liaisons with all these men .
no . you can &apos;t .
you didn &apos;t have to testify .
why did you subject yourself to this ?
because i admit my transgressions .
was killing ramon sanchez one of them ?
no . absolutely not .
that seemed very heartfelt .
so your conscience is clear ?
yes . it is .
your honor , i &apos;d like to enter into evidence
prosecution exhibit 24 .
objection . we haven &apos;t seen this .
they can &apos;t blindside us--
this just came into our possession last night .
it rebuts ms. van de kamp &apos;s testimony
regarding her clear conscience .
i &apos;ll allow it .
does this letter look familiar ?
yes . i wrote it .
it &apos;s a suicide note , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
this letter was discovered on may 7th at the frost hotel ,
where ms. van de kamp had taken a room .
the manager heard shouting ,
including a reference to &quot; a gun . &quot;
police were summoned , but ms. van de kamp was gone .
this was found in the wastebasket .
proceed , ms. stone .
do you recall anything else of significance
occurring on may 7th ?
no .
that &apos;s the day your boyfriend , chuck vance ,
a decorated fairview police detective ,
was killed in a hit and run accident , wasn &apos;t it ?
objection . my client isn &apos;t on trial
for killing detective vance .
not yet .
your honor--
withdrawn .
please . read the letter .
&quot; i never thought i could feel such ... remorse , such guilt . &quot;
your honor , if we could take a short recess ...
denied .
&quot; no one knows who i really am .
&quot; i &apos;m entirely alone .
&quot; living with this secret is too painful .
i can &apos;t go on . &quot;
doesn &apos;t sound like a clear conscience , does it ,
ms van de kamp ?
no further questions .
bree .
please , i just need to be alone .
not until you tell me what that was about .
i already told you .
i was in a very dark place , with the drinking
and my friends abandoning me .
but i did not kill anyone .
you have to believe me .
i do believe you .
i just ... hope the jury does .
come on . you don &apos;t know that it &apos;s your fault .
please , tom loses his job the day after i dump his boss ?
there &apos;s gotta be some connection ,
and the worst part is this is exactly
what broke us up in the first place--
me trying to control his life .
you really suck at this gay friend thing .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t take you seriously in that dress .
you look like a giant taffeta bruise .
i know . it is horrible . maybe if i accessorize .
unless the accessories are two hands over your eyes ,
forget it . why don &apos;t you just tell renee you hate the dress ?
because she &apos;ll pick another one , and i &apos;ll hate that one , too .
it &apos;s what i do .
i did it to tom all the time .
i didn &apos;t want him to go to school ,
and then i didn &apos;t want him to quit .
i wanted him to get a new job ,
and then i hated it . i don &apos;t know .
maybe i wasn &apos;t unhappy with tom .
maybe i was just ...
unhappy .
at least we know you were right about that dress .
now turn around , let me get you out of it .
seriously ? we &apos;re this close ?
when i tell the whole neighborhood about it ,
i will be kind .
you &apos;re a good friend , lee .
celia , give me the remote !
no ! stop !
give it !
girls , don &apos;t make me come in there !
it &apos;s my turn !
it &apos;s not !
who did this ?
celia .
is that true , ccelia ?
this belonged to my grandmother .
you are in big trouble , young lady .
sweep up the rest , and go to your room .
it &apos;s not my fault . she pushed me into it .
you pushed her ?
she wouldn &apos;t give me the remote ,
and it was my turn to pick what we watch .
so you broke this .
it was my turn .
juanita solis , you were gonna let your sister take the blame
for something you caused ?
that is horrible !
this is your fault . own up to it .
don &apos;t you see how bad--
mom ? i &apos;m sorry .
mommy ?
it &apos;s okay .
go wash up for dinner . i &apos;ll take care of this .
and the fracture found on the victim &apos;s head
is consistent with a blunt force injury .
a blunt force that someone
of ms. van de kamp &apos;s size would be capable of inflicting ?
in my opinion .
your honor , the defense asks the court for a recess .
how did you find that ?
when gaby mentioned her &quot; gardener , &quot; alejandro ,
my alarm bells went off .
i had lindsay do a little investigating .
we &apos;re halfway through your murder trial ,
and i find out the victim is gaby &apos;s stepfather ,
and all you can say is &quot; oh &quot; ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted to tell you , but we made a pact .
who did ?
you and gaby ?
me and gaby and ... other people--
people that i care about .
you care about them enough to lie for them ?
to commit perjury ?
how about enough to go to jail ?
you don &apos;t actually think
that &apos;s gonna happen , do you ?
i don &apos;t know .
after the d.a. &apos; s suicide note stunt ,
it &apos;s possible .
to the jury , you look like you &apos;re hiding something ,
and the fact is , you are .
look , i just--i just-- i wanna win this case
for you , okay ?
and if this is something that can exonerate you ...
it can , but not without betraying my friends .
bree ...
you &apos;re facing 20 years to life .
this could be your only way out .
i think it &apos;s time to tell the truth about gaby .
yes , recent events in the lives of my friends
had stirred up intense emotions ...
excitement about starting a new chapter ...
guilt over causing another &apos;s pain ...
disappointment in a failure to change .
then there are those who are asked
to put all emotion aside
in order to make a coldhearted decision .
gaby , what are you doing here ?
i finally found the perfect scarf .
it &apos;s ... elegant .
it &apos;s dignified . it &apos;s beautiful .
it &apos;s you .
you are so sweet .
you didn &apos;t need to do this .
yes , i did .
i haven &apos;t truly thanked you for what you &apos;re doing ,
the way you &apos;re sacrificing yourself for me and my family .
you &apos;re just a much better person than i could ever hope to be .
