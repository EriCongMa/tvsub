avery mckernon was the first client
i ever brought into the firm .
i have stacked my engines up against bronson
and everyone else &apos;s in the world ,
and mine win ,
because i make sure they &apos;re designed better than anyone else &apos;s .
and that &apos;s the speech you &apos;re gonna give .
i said i was giving you 50 % of mckernon .
i didn &apos;t say i was keeping the other 50 % .
you finally realized they need an upgrade in representation ?
it &apos;s up to you , jack .
stand by provision c35
or pack up your shit .
i want you to tell me
the worst mistake you ever made as a therapist ?
that wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
i killed someone .
what ?
a client needed someone to get his son out of rehab
so that he could attend his mother &apos;s funeral .
i knew deep down inside he wasn &apos;t ready ,
but i gave the go @-@ ahead anyway ,
and the night of the funeral ...
he overdosed and died .
i &apos;m surprised you called for another appointment .
what can i say ?
you telling me that story got to me .
so you &apos;re ready to tell the truth ?
i am . the woman in my dream was donna .
i don &apos;t think the woman in your dream was actually donna .
i think it was your mother .
i don &apos;t believe it .
i tell you the thing that &apos;s been eating at me for days ,
and you call me a liar ?
no , i &apos;m not calling you a liar .
your dream was a representation of unresolved issues .
the only unresolved issue is i told you the truth ,
and you &apos;re turning on me .
bringing up your mother isn &apos;t turning on you .
you have no idea what bringing up my mother is to me .
no , i don &apos;t .
that &apos;s the whole point of what we &apos;re doing here .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we &apos;re doing here ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not staying .
harvey , i don &apos;t care how much money you make
or how many women you sleep with .
you have issues in your life
that are going to keep you from having real relationships .
now , you can tell yourself
it has nothing to do with your mother all you want ,
but it &apos;s a lie , and you know it .
and i said we &apos;re done .
louis , we need to talk .
oh , if it &apos;s about the summer associate with b.o. ,
that is out of my control .
it &apos;s about jack soloff .
what ? so help me , if that asshole
is backing out of his agreement , i--
no one &apos;s backing out of anything .
well , then what &apos;s the problem ?
right now there is no problem .
we beat him . he &apos;s been neutralized .
but that &apos;s not where i want him to stay .
what do you mean ?
i mean we &apos;ve won ,
but the man &apos;s shown himself to be a force .
and if he &apos;s ever gonna come around to being on our side ,
we have to give him time to lick his wounds .
i don &apos;t care what you say ,
but that weasel is never gonna be on our side .
and that &apos;s exactly the kind of petty thinking
that led to your feuds with scottie , hardman ,
harvey , me , just to name a few .
jessica , this is different , and you know it .
jack started this whole thing .
louis , last night you asked
when were you going to learn to listen to me .
the time is now .
and you said--
i don &apos;t care what i said .
if you let your pettiness
get the better of you with jack ,
so help me god ,
you will not be the one left standing .
you have my word .
louis , i need to talk to you ,
and i don &apos;t want you to be upset .
what is it ?
dominic barone called .
he wants to come in for a meeting .
now , i know he called me--
excellent . pick a time .
but you &apos;re not mad that he called me instead of you ?
why would i be mad ?
am i in the right office ?
mike , you &apos;re thinking of the old louis .
the new louis is not petty ,
and he definitely does not get upset
about things like who called who .
and may i ask where the new louis came from ?
from inside .
i took a look at the man in the mirror ,
and i decided it was time to make a change .
well , i &apos;m glad you did .
and i don &apos;t know what dominic wants ,
but whatever it is ,
i &apos;m looking forward to working with you on it .
did you just hear that ?
yes .
then you know once mike and dominic agree to a time ,
you need to reschedule it .
louis .
dominic needs to learn that i &apos;m the man in charge .
but you &apos;re not the man in charge ,
because harvey gave you and mike mckernon motors to share .
but dominic doesn &apos;t know that ,
and mike and i gave him a card at the same time .
and mike &apos;s says &quot; associate , &quot;
and mine says &quot; pearson specter litt , &quot;
and i crossed out the &quot; pearson specter &quot; like i always do .
louis , did you not hear what jessica said
about stopping all the pettiness ?
yeah , that was about jack soloff .
no , it was about pettiness .
donna , i &apos;m sorry , but i only have
a certain amount of non @-@ pettiness in me ,
and the real louis litt needs to come out somewhere .
okay , louis , you want dominic to think you &apos;re the man ?
then you need to stop worrying about who he called
and start worrying about what he needs ,
which is for you to be a great lawyer .
good , you &apos;re here .
did you file the johnson brief ?
not yet .
then do it this morning .
i want to drop the hammer on those guys this afternoon .
well , before you do , there &apos;s a sam tull waiting to see you .
who the hell is sam tull ?
tall , handsome , steely blue eyes ?
not ringing any bells .
well , maybe this will knock the cobwebs out .
he said the last time you saw him ,
he was with morello asset management
and you threatened to kick his ass .
you let him in my office ?
do i look like i was born yesterday ?
he &apos;s in the conference room
under the supervision of one rachel zane .
i told him if he didn &apos;t behave himself ,
i &apos;d kick his ass myself .
you &apos;d do that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
i sure as hell would .
and if you don &apos;t get in there this second ,
i &apos;ll kick yours .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re here
to take me up on that offer to step outside .
i &apos;m not .
good , then we &apos;ve established
that you &apos;re smarter than the last time i saw you .
now get the hell out of our offices .
harvey , the man came to see us .
rachel , this man is an asshole ,
and he was willing to let an innocent person go to jail .
and now i &apos;m an innocent person who could go to jail .
what ?
i &apos;m being accused of making unauthorized trades .
by morello ?
i don &apos;t work there anymore .
i work at butler trading .
good for you . were they authorized or not ?
i swear to god i didn &apos;t do one thing
they don &apos;t know about .
and let me guess , you don &apos;t have any proof ?
no , i don &apos;t ...
because that &apos;s the way things work .
what does that mean ?
it means he &apos;s saying they checked his trades
enough to decide it was okay with the risk
but not enough to put it in writing .
okay , but why wouldn &apos;t they put it in writing ?
because they would rather say i went rogue
than pay a $ 2 million fine .
here &apos;s the problem , sam .
why should i believe you , when the last time we met
you were the one who was willing to put
an innocent person away ?
because i didn &apos;t know she was innocent .
and the truth is ... i didn &apos;t care .
but you did .
i &apos;m telling you ...
i didn &apos;t do this .
please , i need your help .
if i find out you &apos;re lying to me ,
this time i won &apos;t just threaten you .
i will beat the shit out of you .
donna , could i talk to you for a minute ?
yeah , if you can tell me where the honey is hiding .
oh , sneaky little bear .
so what &apos;s on your mind ?
okay , so i &apos;m trying to plan
something special for our wedding .
what ? we &apos;re getting married ?
mike , this is so sudden . i &apos;m gonna have to think about it .
and what about rachel ? oh , who cares about rachel ?
i love you .
are you finished ?
do i have to be ?
donna , i &apos;m serious .
okay , what do you need ?
rachel told me it was her fantasy
to get married on her birthday at the plaza hotel .
so i called to arrange it , but then--
they &apos;re booked for the next five years .
how did you know that ?
same reason you came to me for help--i know what i know .
well , i need someplace just as good .
there is no place just as good .
so what am i supposed to do ?
you already did what you &apos;re supposed to do .
you came to me .
now , put brody back and don &apos;t hide him this time .
you named the bear ?
you want me to help you or not ?
paul gilroy .
yes . and you are ?
i &apos;m the guy who &apos;s gonna keep sam tull out of jail .
and how are you gonna do that , mister--
specter .
harvey specter .
you &apos;re gonna pay that fine and admit what you did .
well , i &apos;m sorry to disappoint you , mr. specter ,
but there &apos;s no way i &apos;m admitting to something i didn &apos;t do .
whether you admit it or not ,
you &apos;re gonna write a check either way .
it &apos;s up to you whether it &apos;s for $ 2 million or $ 30 million .
my associate seems to be running late ,
so go ahead , take me for a walk down bullshit lane .
we &apos;re suing you for $ 30 million .
well , i must have fired five other people ,
because wrongful termination &apos;s capped at $ 5 million .
we &apos;re not suing you for wrongful termination .
we &apos;re suing you for malicious prosecution .
you can &apos;t do that . i &apos;m not a prosecutor .
no , you &apos;re not , but you &apos;re framing my client
for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
so it &apos;s up to you , paul .
write the little check or the big check .
ball &apos;s in your court .
dominic , you &apos;re here early . how are you ?
good .
in fact , i was just thinking about the last time i was here .
you were helping me become c.e.o ..
oh , come on , you pretty much became c.e.o. all on your own .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter how i got there .
you &apos;re gonna help me stay there .
what &apos;s that ?
the future of battery @-@ powered engines .
we need it , or we don &apos;t survive .
i &apos;m guessing there &apos;s a catch .
the catch is it costs a fortune .
but i have a handshake deal with the c.e.o. of range tech .
we started as mechanics together ,
and if i can close in two weeks ,
he &apos;ll sell me the whole company at a price i can afford .
if i can &apos;t , he puts it on the market .
we &apos;ll be out of business in ten years .
what &apos;s going on ?
you guys starting the meeting without me ?
no , dominic just got here early ,
but the headline is
he wants us to close a handshake deal
to buy range tech within the next two weeks ,
and i was about to tell him that we could .
well , i &apos;m sorry , but we can &apos;t .
what do you mean you can &apos;t ?
i mean there &apos;s no way that we can close a deal like this
in two weeks without skipping due diligence .
no , louis ,
he &apos;s known the c.e.o. for 30 years .
so we don &apos;t have to skip it ,
but we can do a streamlined version .
okay , well , then we might as well not do it at all .
we don &apos;t get it done in that time ,
i can lose this deal .
they put a clock on it .
and why would they do that ?
i &apos;ll tell you why ,
because they know you won &apos;t pay attention
to whatever it is that they &apos;re trying to slide by you .
slide something by me ?
this is my friend . we have a handshake deal .
a handshake deal doesn &apos;t mean shit .
louis !
it &apos;s okay , mike .
obviously louis doesn &apos;t get me .
because to me , a handshake deal means everything .
so you do whatever due diligence you can in the next week ,
because if you mess up my deal ,
i &apos;ll be looking for a new law firm .
paul gilroy &apos;s lawyer called .
that was fast .
want the bad news or the worse news ?
why don &apos;t you give me both
and let me decide what kind of news it is .
not only are they not paying the fine .
they also filed a motion to have our suit dismissed .
man , i should &apos;ve known .
should &apos;ve known what ?
that you were full of shit when you said dominic calling me
to set up that meeting didn &apos;t bother you .
i don &apos;t care who he called .
i did what i did in there because the client comes first .
bullshit , you antagonized me and then dominic .
oh , what meeting were you in ?
i wasn &apos;t antagonizing him . i was protecting him .
oh , really ?
by shitting all over his idea and then pissing him off ?
i don &apos;t care if we pissed him off .
he doesn &apos;t need a friend .
what he needs is for us to be great lawyers .
louis , you have a history of getting bent out of shape
over hierarchy , so don &apos;t tell me
that has nothing to do with this .
okay , fine , mike . you know what , you &apos;re right .
i did get bent out of shape . did .
but then i got over it , because as i said ,
the client comes first .
you really expect me to believe that ?
mike , a few years ago , dominic spent 90 % of his time
under the hood .
he is rushing into this
because he feels it &apos;s his only chance , and you know it .
you think harvey would sign off on this without due diligence ?
and let me guess , you expect me to do all the work ?
no , you take half , i take half .
we do the work together .
oh , you &apos;re not hearing me .
oh , i &apos;m hearing you .
no , you &apos;re not .
i &apos;m calling on behalf of michael jordan .
i don &apos;t care who you &apos;re calling for .
we &apos;re booked on that date .
oh , but your assistant , ginny , said that the smiths
might be willing to , um--
first of all , it &apos;s patricia , not ginny .
and it &apos;s the mcmillans , not the smiths .
so , if you don &apos;t have anything else , then--
you know what ? that was a legitimate question ,
and it would be nice if you weren &apos;t so rude .
so the least you can do is messenger over a brochure ,
because if you don &apos;t ,
mr. jordan is gonna call the manager of the plaza
and get your ass fired .
louis , i need to talk to you .
i was just on my way to see you .
about the pending epa investigation ?
shit .
i thought you &apos;d be gloating .
you &apos;re the one who wanted this .
i didn &apos;t want this . i feared this .
if dominic buys range tech ,
he &apos;s in huge trouble .
and if we tell him that without having a solution ,
he &apos;ll fire us .
that &apos;s the thing . i have a solution .
i found a company that has a battery division
that we can buy .
now , we just have to approach them and--
no . did you not just hear what i said ?
we cannot jeopardize his deal .
we won &apos;t be jeopardizing it
if we can get them to sign a nondisclosure agreement .
and the only way we &apos;ll be able to get them to do that
is if they &apos;re our client .
well , then it &apos;s a good thing they are .
you found one of our own clients ?
you &apos;re a genius .
yeah , there &apos;s only one problem .
they &apos;re jack soloff &apos;s client .
forget it , we need to find another company .
there is no other company .
mike , there is no way that soloff
will work with us on this . he hates me .
then we have to find a way to make him un @-@ hate you ,
because i &apos;m telling you , this deal is good for jack ,
and it is good for us .
there has to be a way .
well , then you talk to him .
are you--are you saying you want me
to negotiate with soloff on my own ?
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re a team , and there &apos;s a better chance
of soloff saying yes to you than to me .
what are you doing here ?
i was just getting an nda . what are you doing here ?
i am actually here for you .
i &apos;m making copies of a brochure from the plaza hotel .
wait , so you got it done ?
no , i called them ,
and they were dicks ,
and they got pissed at me .
so you failed ?
okay .
if by &quot; failed , &quot;
you mean i got the name
of the wedding planner , her assistant ,
the couple getting married ,
and a brochure with their letterhead on it ,
then , yeah , mike , yeah , i failed .
whoa , donna , are you sure you can handle this ?
do you ask a chef who &apos;s cooking
if the meal &apos;s gonna turn out okay ?
no , you sit back , you behave yourself
until you get the best duck à l &apos;orange
you &apos;ve ever tasted .
yeah , i don &apos;t really like duck with orange stuff .
get out .
gone .
i like the way you operate .
excuse me ?
never let them see you sweat .
what makes you think i &apos;m sweating ?
my eyes .
you may have fooled opie with that metaphor ,
but we both know you got duck à la shit .
okay , new girl , i don &apos;t know who you think you &apos;re talking to ,
but this is what i do .
what you do .
i &apos;ve been doing shit like this
since you was an itch in your daddy &apos;s pants .
hang on , did you just quote lethal weapon to me ?
you got that ?
maybe you do have something .
good luck with your duck , red .
mr. tull , how long have you been working at butler trading ?
almost three years .
and how much money have you made
for their clients over that time ?
approximately $ 150 million .
so let me get this straight .
you made a trade , lost money , they did nothing .
but the day they find out that they have to pay a fine ,
they said you were acting alone
and they &apos;re letting you go to jail ?
exactly .
and how do you know they signed off on your trade ?
because everyone knows that they sign off on every trade .
and , ultimately , who would be responsible
for stopping a trade that violated regulations ?
paul gilroy .
so it couldn &apos;t possibly be that you knew what you were doing ,
you kept it secret , and that all of this is your fault ?
it could be , but it isn &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s interesting ,
because we have somebody who says it is .
and who the hell is that ?
mr. tull &apos;s therapist .
what ?
a therapist can &apos;t testify against their own patient .
she can if we paid for it and he signed a waiver ,
which he did .
mr. tull , your therapist &apos;s testimony is coming ,
and when it does , your ability to cut a deal goes away .
drop this matter ,
and no one ever knows you saw a therapist at all .
you went to see a company @-@ provided therapist ,
and you never told me ?
i didn &apos;t think it mattered .
well , it goddamn does .
did you tell this woman you did this ?
no , because i didn &apos;t do this .
well , they &apos;re not bringing her in to testify to that .
i told her that i felt guilty ,
as if the whole thing was my fault .
i never said it was .
well , you might as well have ,
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s gonna sound like .
harvey--
how could you be so stupid
to confide your feelings to a stranger ?
because i needed help .
and if you &apos;re not gonna talk about your feelings ,
you might as well not see a therapist at all .
you better hope there are therapists in prison ,
because if i can &apos;t stop her from testifying ,
that &apos;s where you &apos;re gonna end up .
mike ross , what brings you down to my office ?
i &apos;m here with a proposal from louis .
you &apos;re here because louis wants something from me ,
but he &apos;s too afraid to ask .
he &apos;s not afraid .
he just sent me here because he figured
you might hear it better coming from me .
mckernon motors wants to make an investment
in battery technology .
we &apos;d like to quietly negotiate with tanaka ,
and we need your help getting them to sign this .
and why would i do that ?
because it &apos;s huge money ,
and now that contingent compensation is back at the firm ,
it &apos;s huge money for you .
and the last time louis came to me with an offer like this ,
it was bullshit .
well , i &apos;m not louis , and this isn &apos;t bullshit .
then i guess i just have one question .
how much of the deal are you authorized to give away ?
50 % , and that &apos;s more than fair .
maybe it is , but i want all of it .
you know this helps your client , right ?
i don &apos;t give a shit . all of it or none of it .
it &apos;s gonna be none of it ,
and you &apos;re just taking money out of your own pocket .
i don &apos;t care , because this isn &apos;t about money .
it &apos;s about getting even , so run along .
go tell louis i &apos;m not lifting a finger to help him
unless i get everything .
wow , you really are a dick .
i take it that means you know where i stand .
jessica , hi . what can i do for you ?
how &apos;s the wedding planning going ?
oh , well , we &apos;re still looking for a venue ,
but things are moving along .
i hear a lot of couples fight during this time .
well , i happen to have a fiance who &apos;s smart enough
to leave everything to me .
but that is not why you &apos;re here .
i want to know how harvey &apos;s doing .
with our case ?
no , i just want to know how he &apos;s doing .
he &apos;s doing fine .
keep an eye on him .
i will .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re coming to my offices tomorrow
to testify against my client and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
i didn &apos;t tell you because this is the first
i &apos;m hearing about it .
bullshit , i saw it .
you got subpoenaed to testify against sam tull .
and until you just burst in here ,
i had no idea he was your client .
well , it doesn &apos;t matter because you &apos;re not showing up .
and you &apos;re going to stop them from arresting me , are you ?
because that &apos;s what will happen if i don &apos;t .
then get yourself someone like me and get out of it .
for your information ,
i have been to three different men like you ,
because i care about sam ,
and you know better than i do
that once he signed that release , i have no choice .
well , i have a way to get you out of it ,
and you &apos;re gonna do it .
they ask you something that &apos;s gonna send him to jail ,
you lie .
i can &apos;t do that .
you can , and you will , and they &apos;ll never know .
i &apos;ll know .
and even if i didn &apos;t , i have notes ,
and if they found those , i &apos;d be going to jail .
then destroy them , because he &apos;s innocent ,
and he trusted you with everything .
and if that doesn &apos;t mean something to you ,
then why the hell should anyone ever trust you with anything ?
harvey , this isn &apos;t about us .
no one can ever make me do that to you .
i &apos;m sure sam tull thought the same thing .
well ?
it &apos;s not gonna work .
he said no ?
he said he wants 100 % of the deal .
piece of shit .
i know .
so ...
i don &apos;t know . we &apos;re gonna have to think of something else .
give it to him .
what ?
i said give it to him .
louis , hey , i know we &apos;re under the gun
with this dominic thing , but i really don &apos;t think
it &apos;s a good idea to let him push you around like that .
i &apos;m not letting him push me around .
i &apos;m listening to my leader .
what are you talking about ?
remember when you asked me where the new louis was coming from
and i told you from me ?
it wasn &apos;t from me .
it was from jessica .
she asked me to stop the pettiness once and for all .
and if i can &apos;t do that now , i &apos;ll never be able to do it .
okay , then i guess all we have to do
is figure out a way to sell the idea to tanaka .
oh , trust me .
if i can do this , i definitely can do that .
louis , what the hell have you done ?
what ? i &apos;m setting up for our meeting with tanaka .
are you kidding me ?
this isn &apos;t gung ho .
louis , they &apos;re gonna take one look at you ,
they &apos;re gonna run out the door .
no , they &apos;re not .
mike , tanaka &apos;s a japanese company steeped in tradition .
i don &apos;t care what you think they are .
this is offensive .
there &apos;s absolutely nothing offensive
about showing respect for another culture .
and what do you know about their culture ?
mike , trust me .
when i was in junior high ,
we had an exchange student stay with us .
ooh , suki .
here we go .
she was far from home
and proud of her culture ,
and she set up everything in this room
to make herself feel comfortable ,
right down to giving my father this very kimono
and laying out a map of her hometown .
louis , i want you to listen to me .
they are gonna be here in 45 minutes ,
and if you are still dressed like that
and this room still looks like this ,
dominic is going to fire us .
they &apos;re not gonna be here in 45 minutes ,
&apos;cause they &apos;re here right now .
mr. tanaka @-@ san .
who did this ?
i did .
that is a map of shikoku .
my family is from there .
i know .
how ?
because we do our homework , sir ,
just like we did our homework on this deal .
i think we are going to get along very nicely .
please .
what are you doing ?
get the tea .
you want--
yeah , get the tea .
okay .
oh , you must be the future mcmillans .
i would say sorry i &apos;m late , but i am not sorry .
so let us begin discussing the details
of your first wedding .
i &apos;m sorry . you are ?
oh , my name is of no consequence .
what is , is that my company has taken over
the planning service of the plaza hotel .
here &apos;s our brochure .
mm , i can see by the look on your faces
that bitch patricia , she did not tell you .
bitch ?
we love patricia .
well , she &apos;s no longer with us .
as i was saying , the menu will no longer be optional .
we &apos;ll be serving duck a l &apos;orange , escargot ,
and foie gras .
but we &apos;re vegan .
what is that ?
it &apos;s--
it doesn &apos;t matter .
we are french .
you eat what we serve , or you do not eat .
can we taste it ?
oh , would you like me to just show you my naked body
before we go out to dinner and you want to sleep with me ?
i need to go to the restroom .
okay , so here &apos;s what &apos;s gonna happen .
she &apos;s gonna want to drop me ,
and you &apos;re gonna drop the plaza hotel .
what ?
cut the shit , john .
i did that so you could have some cover .
i did some checking ,
and you either need to change the location of your wedding ,
or i &apos;m gonna tell her about your mistress .
yeah .
dr. agard , when did sam tull start seeing you as a patient ?
approximately six months ago .
and why did he start seeing you ?
he said his job involved taking risks ,
and it was causing him stress .
so he wanted to stop taking risks ?
no , he wanted to continue .
oh , i get it .
he wanted to continue with the risks ,
he just wanted to feel better about it .
yes .
and were you able to help him feel better
about taking these risks ?
um , uh , we made progress .
yes or no ?
yes .
and after you helped him feel good about taking risks ,
did he reveal that he then lost $ 50 million on one trade ?
dr. agard , you are under oath .
and if you will not answer ,
i will have a judge compel you to answer .
yes .
and how did he say he felt about losing $ 50 million
on one trade ?
he said he felt guilty about it .
so he came to you to continue taking risks
until he finally lost $ 50 million
and then admitted to being guilty .
that is not what she said .
i &apos;m sorry , he just felt guilty .
you want to drop this now ,
or do you want us to hand this tape over to the sec ?
dr. agard , did you want to give the testimony you just gave ?
of course not .
and why is that ?
because i care about my clients .
is it possible that you didn &apos;t want to give it
because it &apos;s not true ?
no , it &apos;s not possible .
you couldn &apos;t possibly have been pressured
to give false testimony against your wishes ?
no , i couldn &apos;t have .
have you ever been pressured to do something
you didn &apos;t want to do by a client before ?
let me rephrase .
isn &apos;t it true that you released a client that you cared about
from rehab for no reason
other than you felt pressure from a different client
who was actually paying the bills ?
dr. agard , you &apos;re under oath ,
and if you will not answer ,
i will have a judge compel you to answer .
yes .
and did this person die of an overdose
less than 24 hours later ?
yes .
so if you let yourself be pressured
when someone &apos;s life is at risk ,
what &apos;s to make us think you &apos;re not doing
the exact same thing right now ?
you arrogant piece of shit .
watch yourself . this is my office .
well , i don &apos;t care what it is .
how dare you betray me like that ?
i tried to warn you .
you didn &apos;t warn me .
you asked me to lie for you , and i told you i wouldn &apos;t .
i asked you to lie for sam tull--
this isn &apos;t about sam tull , and you know it .
what the hell are you talking about ?
i opened up to you so that we could build trust ,
not so that you could humiliate me .
i humiliated you to help a man
you say you care about .
and our fighting about your mother
had nothing to do with that ?
excuse me ?
you walked out of our session
because you didn &apos;t want to talk about your mother .
and the second you had the chance
to permanently damage our relationship , you took it .
you &apos;re insane .
and you &apos;re a self @-@ serving narcissist
who will do or say anything to get what he wants .
i did what i did in there to protect my client .
and i don &apos;t give a shit if it hurt your feelings or not ,
because you betrayed him
just as much as i &apos;m betraying you .
and you may be the one who &apos;s crying about it ,
but he &apos;s the one who &apos;s been accused of committing a crime .
if you &apos;re lucky , someday you &apos;re gonna realize
what &apos;s really going on here , and when that day comes ,
i hope you find someone to help you ,
because it isn &apos;t going to be me .
mike , put that coffee down and check this out .
it &apos;s a map of scarsdale-- where i grew up .
tanaka returned the favor .
actually , louis , i got that for you .
you did ? why ?
because you were right and i was wrong ,
and as crazy as it seems ,
you and i actually make a pretty good team .
now all that &apos;s left is calling dominic to set up a meeting .
why don &apos;t you do it ?
i can &apos;t .
i got to go hang my map .
dominic , what are you doing here ?
i was just about to call you .
to say what , that you blew up my deal ?
because i already know .
what ?
that &apos;s right . range tech called me after they heard
that i was negotiating with another company .
problem is , i wasn &apos;t negotiating with another company .
my lawyers were without my consent .
okay , calm down , dominic .
there was a problem with range tech .
i told you that i didn &apos;t want there to be any problems !
well , if you &apos;d bought them ,
their problems were gonna become your problems .
but just calm down and take a second ,
because we brought you a solution .
which is what ?
mike , don &apos;t call dominic . tanaka pulled out .
pulled out of what ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re both fired .
harvey , i need to talk to you .
not now , rachel .
sam tull &apos;s been arrested .
what ?
gilroy &apos;s lawyer gave formal notice to the sec .
they won &apos;t pay the fine under any circumstance .
god damn it .
gretchen , get paul gilroy on the phone .
harvey , what are you gonna do ?
tull can &apos;t go to prison for this .
no one &apos;s going to prison .
but how do you know that ?
we didn &apos;t think he &apos;d be arrested in the first place .
i don &apos;t care what we thought .
it &apos;s not gonna happen because i &apos;m not letting it happen .
i &apos;ve got mr. gilroy on line one .
are you out of your mind ? you contacted the sec ?
they contacted me .
and i &apos;m not the one who filed a malicious prosecution lawsuit .
no , you &apos;re the one who got his ass kicked
in a deposition then turned around and asked for more .
i didn &apos;t get my ass kicked , mr. specter .
that idiot therapist did , and she no longer works for us .
but you still don &apos;t have any proof
that i authorized those trades , and you never will .
so i suggest you stop harassing me
and focus on getting your client out of jail .
you heard the man .
we &apos;re dropping the lawsuit ?
no , we &apos;re doubling the damages .
get it done .
you son of a bitch . you set us up .
i &apos;m sorry , louis , i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
oh , bullshit . you told tanaka not to make a deal .
yes , i did .
at first , it looked like a good idea ,
but then i did my due diligence ,
and lo and behold , it didn &apos;t .
was that before or after you leaked our meeting to range tech ?
i have to say , i &apos;m appalled .
i mean , after you &apos;ve been so aboveboard
in all your dealings with me ,
to think that i would go behind your back
and leak news of that meeting with no possible chance
of it being linked back to me , that &apos;s really offensive .
it is linked back to you , plain as day .
then i guess you two must have some sort of proof ,
because if you don &apos;t ,
you can walk yourselves the hell out of my office .
it &apos;s one thing for you to have your feud with me ,
but you just cost your firm a huge piece of business .
let me explain to you what i already told him .
this isn &apos;t about business . it &apos;s about getting even .
harvey , do you have a minute ?
if you &apos;re here to tell me to drop that countersuit--
i &apos;m not telling you to drop anything .
i &apos;m just saying in addition to attacking gilroy ,
we should be getting proof that sam got the authorization
for those trades .
we don &apos;t have any proof .
we can if we get some of the other traders
to come forward and say how it went .
they &apos;ll never testify to that .
harvey , that therapist was the company therapist .
those traders saw her on a regular basis
to keep their shit together .
so , if sam opened up to her about work ,
then some of the other traders must have too .
she can &apos;t speak to that .
of course she can .
if tull waived privilege , then they all did .
you know that .
it doesn &apos;t matter . you saw what i did to her .
she &apos;s not gonna want to help us .
it &apos;s not about helping us . it &apos;s about helping her client .
i can &apos;t ask her to do that .
why not ?
because i can &apos;t .
harvey , what &apos;s going on ?
nothing &apos;s going on .
how did you know those things about her in that deposition ?
because i did .
does it have something to do with the fact
that you &apos;ve been having panic attacks
and that she &apos;s your therapist ?
because if it does--
this conversation is over .
look , i am not trying to butt into things
that don &apos;t concern me , but this isn &apos;t about you .
this is about keeping sam tull out of prison .
what the hell are you doing here ?
you two don &apos;t work for me anymore .
just give us a minute to explain .
there &apos;s nothing to explain .
you blew up my deal and ruined a friendship
because you thought you knew better than me .
we do know better than you .
you &apos;re an arrogant son of a bitch .
dominic , this is a draft of a class @-@ action lawsuit
headed range tech &apos;s way
the second the epa &apos;s report comes out .
that &apos;s the same report that your friend kept buried .
and if you &apos;d bought them ,
that suit would have been headed your way .
so , yes , we blew up the deal ,
but that man was never your friend .
you lied to me , and worse than that ,
you didn &apos;t respect me .
i am sorry . i shouldn &apos;t have antagonized you .
and i shouldn &apos;t have said that rushing through this deal
without doing due diligence was feasible .
you see , the bottom line is , is that we were both right
when we tried to do this deal with tanaka .
and now that we &apos;ve got nothing to hide from you ,
there is nothing to stop us from finding you someone else .
so , instead of standing here kissing my ass ,
why don &apos;t you get to work doing that ?
if you &apos;re here to apologize , i &apos;m not interested .
i &apos;m not here to apologize .
i &apos;m here because i need to look at your files .
there really is no end to your arrogance .
i wouldn &apos;t ask if this wasn &apos;t
the only way to keep sam out of prison .
i &apos;m not giving you sam tull &apos;s file .
and i &apos;m not asking for it .
i want to see all the files of the other traders you saw .
are you out of your mind ?
no , i &apos;m not . they all signed the same waiver sam did .
some of them must have admitted the way it works at butler ,
and it &apos;s in your notes .
let me see if i have my facts straight .
you eviscerate me , justify it ,
and then waltz back here as if nothing happened .
i know something happened , but now is not the time .
you mean now is not the time as long as you need a favor .
oh , god damn it , you &apos;re not doing me a favor .
you &apos;re helping your patient , the one you said
you went to see three different lawyers to keep from betraying .
and if you hadn &apos;t betrayed me ,
you wouldn &apos;t be in this position right now .
what do you want me to say-- i &apos;m sorry ?
as a matter of fact , i do .
you think i wanted to depose you like that ?
it made me sick .
i hated every goddamn second of it ,
because i know all you &apos;ve been trying to do is help me ,
and the only reason i didn &apos;t apologize before
is because if i knew it kept sam out of prison ,
i &apos;d do it all again .
now , are you gonna help me ?
harvey , even if i wanted to help you ,
it -- it doesn &apos;t say those things in my files .
i need them anyway .
i just told you they don &apos;t have what you need .
i know that , and you know that ,
but they don &apos;t know that .
you &apos;re gonna try and bluff them ?
it won &apos;t work .
you saw what i did in there to you ,
and that was something i didn &apos;t want to do .
trust me , they won &apos;t know what hit &apos; em .
we get fired by mckernon motors ,
and you didn &apos;t tell me and you didn &apos;t tell harvey ?
wait , jessica--
god damn it .
we didn &apos;t tell anyone because we were fired
for less than a day , and then we fixed it .
oh , you fixed it ?
yes , it was all a misunderstanding .
now dominic &apos;s back on board .
i don &apos;t give a shit that dominic is back on board
and neither does fletcher engines .
fletcher engines ?
that &apos;s right .
in the less than a day that you were fired by mckernon ,
jack soloff signed fletcher as a client ,
and now i have to let mckernon go .
that son of a bitch .
jessica , he set this whole thing up .
oh , and i &apos;m sure you did nothing to antagonize him .
i did do nothing . i swear , i wasn &apos;t petty .
i trusted him , and then he used that trust
to stab us in the back .
jessica , you have no idea .
louis has never been more right in his life .
you can &apos;t dump mckernon . it &apos;ll kill harvey .
well , we can &apos;t goddamn represent them now ,
and you know it .
we can if you tell jack he has to drop fletcher .
do you realize the position you &apos;re putting me in ?
fletcher is worth three times what mckernon is .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re in this position right now ,
but for once , i &apos;m not the one who put you in it .
jack soloff is .
dinner is served .
i guess that means you got opie his bridal gift after all .
i did .
and i shouldn &apos;t have been so standoffish with you in the file room .
well , maybe i shouldn &apos;t have had that be our first interaction .
no , that &apos;s not on you . that &apos;s on me .
i never welcomed you to the firm , and i should have .
you know , when i was a young mother ,
first week of school , every day i dropped my little girl off .
when i left , she cried .
friday came , i left , she didn &apos;t cry .
so i did .
what are you saying ?
you didn &apos;t welcome me to the firm
because you weren &apos;t ready to see your little girl move on .
are you saying harvey is my little girl ?
i &apos;m saying you weren &apos;t ready to move on .
you &apos;re all right , gretchen .
hope you like french .
hi .
you know , you didn &apos;t have to schedule an appointment
just to tell me how it turned out .
i scheduled an appointment to give you these .
thank you very much .
they &apos;re from sam tull .
did you get me anything ?
i did .
i &apos;m ready to talk about my mother .
this is beautiful .
why did--
i wanted to celebrate a special occasion .
what &apos;s the special occasion ?
i got us the plaza hotel on your birthday .
for our wedding ?
yeah .
oh , that is the sweetest thing you &apos;ve done
since you asked me to marry you .
no , it &apos;s the sweetest thing i &apos;ve done
until the next thing i do .
oh , mike .
i mean , how did you do it ?
that must have been impossible .
no , it was a piece of cake .
you went to donna , didn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s why it was a piece of cake .
jessica , what are you doing here so late ?
i didn &apos;t get a chance to congratulate you
on signing fletcher engines .
hey , good news travels fast .
yes , it does , and you &apos;re going to drop them even faster .
i take it this has something to do
with our long @-@ standing relationship with mckernon motors .
you know damn well what this has to do with .
i know that my client is the fourth @-@ largest engine manufacturer
in the country .
and if you had landed them like a man ,
i &apos;d be the first one in here with a bottle of champagne .
but you did it by putting a shiv in your fellow attorneys .
so this-- it &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna be .
and by &quot; fellow attorneys , &quot; don &apos;t you really mean &quot; harvey &quot; ?
watch yourself , jack ,
and drop fletcher engines by morning .
if you don &apos;t , i will .
by morning it is .
and by afternoon , the entire firm &apos;s gonna know
that you chose a mid @-@ size client over fletcher
because harvey specter has an attachment to them ...
and you have an attachment to him .
i admire people who challenge me , jack .
but there &apos;s a limit to that , and you are on the very edge .
so let me be clear .
this is your last chance to work with me .
take it , and you have a future .
don &apos;t , and you can go ask daniel hardman for a job ,
because we both know that &apos;s how you got the idea
for fletcher engines in the first place .
