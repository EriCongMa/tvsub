daniel is on a digging mission
about my father investing in nolcorp .
i &apos;m your c.f.o. ,
and you can &apos;t tell me
where nearly half a billion dollars went .
it all went to the daughter of our first investor .
david clarke .
i want no ties with you .
meet my brother nate . that &apos;s my partner in the bar .
they &apos;re good guys .
well , the same can &apos;t be said about their old man .
i &apos;m glad you came to your senses , porter .
matt , what the hell are you doing ? give me the gun .
it belongs to you , anyway .
ryan had it coming to him . you know that !
emily and i have a plan to infiltrate grayson global ,
to draw out the initiative .
if you &apos;ll consider me as a replacement to my father ,
we will triple our net worth inside a year .
the choice is yours .
you have to help me protect our son .
we have to block him from taking control of the board ,
no matter what it takes .
for the righteous ,
a revelation is a joyous event ,
the realization of a divine truth .
but for the wicked ,
revelations can be far more terrifying ,
when dark secrets are exposed
and sinners are punished for their trespasses .
pull !
pull !
pull !
pull !
excelente , victoria .
well , after my kidnapping ,
i developed a fondness for firearms .
you better not cross this one , conrad .
you have no idea .
pull !
you are out of practice .
yeah , well , leisure time has been in short supply of late .
but once i &apos;m clear of
this absurd no @-@ confidence vote daniel &apos;s launched against me ,
rest assured , my marksmanship will return .
daniel &apos;s talk of delivering nolcorp is a persuasive argument .
oh , please . come on .
even if daniel &apos;s correct
and nolcorp is grayson property ,
nolan ross and his people
are gonna drag this through the courts for years .
trust me , this is not the game changer my son believes it to be .
still , some are listening .
well , some isn &apos;t enough .
they need a two @-@ thirds majority to oust conrad .
which , assuming your influence
over the core members of the board remains absolute ,
should prove pretty much impossible .
my block will vote with me ,
whichever way i choose to go .
do me the honor ?
with pleasure , salvador . pull !
salvador grobet--
brazil &apos;s answer to richard branson .
only rather than building his fortune business by business ,
he married into it .
he and conrad certainly appear cozy .
grobet has voted conrad &apos;s interest in every major decision
since his appointment to the board in &apos; 99 .
unless we change that ,
you lose your shot at a seat next to daniel .
and with it , our inroad to the initiative .
you think we can flip his vote ?
i think grobet is a greedy bastard like the rest of them .
if daniel delivers nolcorp ,
grobet will deliver the board .
sacrificial lamb reporting for the slaughter .
i wasn &apos;t expecting an actual firing squad .
look , i &apos;ll leave you two to , uh , do your thing .
well , now that i &apos;m in the belly of the beast ,
care to explain ?
i need salvador grobet to see
that daniel &apos;s acquisition of nolcorp isn &apos;t just a pipe dream .
your being here makes it credible .
oh , it &apos;s more than credible . it &apos;s inevitable .
i &apos;m sorry about your company , nolan .
i know how much it means to you .
the truth is , ems ,
i &apos;ve been waiting for this shoe to drop for a while now .
but i &apos;ve got a plan that should help mitigate the sting .
and what &apos;s that ?
well , that &apos;s for me to know , and you to find out .
oh , how &apos;s that feel ? not so fun , huh ?
just be careful .
nobody plays dirtier than the graysons .
all right .
great , mr. donovan . okay . we &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
bye .
that &apos;s dad &apos;s address book .
yeah , i &apos;m inviting , uh ,
some of his old crew to the christening .
a lot of these guys really stepped up when he died ,
told me not to be a stranger .
that &apos;s nice .
actually , it was kenny &apos;s idea .
well , mine and nate &apos;s father died suddenly , too .
you know , we miss him every day .
at least little carl &apos;s godfather will be there in the flesh .
oh , is that me ?
i thought you were waiting for bull to say yes .
don &apos;t be a dipstick .
dipstick ?
whoa . i can come back if you two need a minute .
actually , i &apos;m glad you guys are both here .
you really saved our hides with this place ,
and i was hoping you &apos;d come to my son &apos;s christening tomorrow .
yeah , we &apos;d be honored to .
looking forward to meeting some of your dad &apos;s old pals ,
get a sense of the history of this place .
right , nate ?
absolutely .
in fact , open bar for all your guests after the ceremony ,
on us .
mr. grobet ,
good to see you .
please , daniel ,
you are certainly man enough now to call me salvador .
and who is this lovely belleza ?
ashley davenport . nice to meet you .
nice meeting you .
this is aiden mathis ,
satoshi takeda &apos;s liaison to our company .
he &apos;s been spearheading the nolcorp acquisition with me .
despite what conrad says ,
i assume negotiations are going well .
i spotted you speaking with mr. ross earlier .
yes , i , uh , invited him last minute .
a little glad @-@ handing never hurt a negotiation .
mr. takeda taught you well .
where &apos;s your wife today , salvador ?
sadly , magda couldn &apos;t make the trip .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m left to entertain myself .
well , i will be happy to organize activities
to fill your time .
oh , i &apos;d love that , ms. davenport .
would you like to take a turn , daniel ?
why not ?
pull !
emily .
sorry . bad etiquette .
but an impressive shot .
i should come to the hamptons more often .
beautiful women seem to fall from the skies .
oh , you &apos;re too kind .
salvador grobet , emily thorne .
ms. thorne is considering
a sizable investment in grayson global .
and what is your hesitation ?
i &apos;m a cautious person .
and after conrad grayson &apos;s assorted public embarrassments ,
i &apos;d rather see someone a little less ...
burdened at the helm before i open my checkbook ,
namely daniel .
beautiful and pragmatic ...
a splendid combination .
would you care for a cold drink , mr. grobet ?
take the lead , please .
nice shot .
your aim has improved .
well , i taught her a thing or two .
thanks for the vote of confidence .
mr. grobet &apos;s approval is key
to securing my leadership at the company .
i &apos;m happy to help .
have a nice day .
there &apos;s a nice touch ...
trotting ashley out ,
considering salvador &apos;s penchant for exotic women .
i would think he &apos;d have better self @-@ preservation instincts ,
seeing as his wife holds his fortune .
conrad .
we need to discuss your son &apos;s future .
no , we don &apos;t . daniel &apos;s of no concern to you .
oh , on the contrary .
as the changing of the guard
at grayson global appears imminent ,
your usefulness to us seems to have run its course .
all right , you listen to me .
i have no intention of relinquishing control of my company .
you deal with me and only me .
you leave my son out of this .
in the unlikely event the vote swings your way ,
we &apos;re willing to reconsider ,
but be warned .
if you attempt to alert daniel in any way
to our resurgent relationship ,
your son will be removed from the equation permanently .
hello , victoria .
i swear , you so much as lay a hand on my son ,
and i will kill you myself !
understand ? !
hello ?
prepare to enter the lion &apos;s den .
oh , and here comes little simba now .
nolan , ms. lahari , thanks for agreeing to the meeting .
let &apos;s not make this any more unpleasant
than it needs to be .
oh , unpleasant ? pshaw .
isn &apos;t it every man &apos;s dream to give over
49 % of his company to a hostile conglomerate ?
actually , new details have emerged
that alter those terms .
are we all set ?
everything &apos;s in order .
i &apos;m sorry . um ... ash .
where &apos;s aiden mathis ?
he &apos;s the one i &apos;ve been dealing with .
aiden doesn &apos;t work for the company ,
not in any official capacity .
as a courtesy to you ,
i thought you might want to discuss this in private .
i trust no introduction is necessary .
what &apos;s going on ?
who is he ?
would you mind stepping outside ?
what are you doing here , marco ?
i invited him .
as nolcorp &apos;s former c.f.o. ,
i thought mr. romero might help shed some light
on your company &apos;s solvency .
what he shared with me , however ,
was a far more interesting story
about a missing $ 500 @-@ million bank account .
what did you tell him ?
marco here claims he set up an offshore account for you
as a tax shelter back in 2002--
an account that was mysteriously drained
a week before nolcorp went public .
did he tell you who the money was for ?
no , all he told me was that
you had sole control over the account .
fine ...
danny .
you want the money ? i &apos;ll write you a check .
oh , it &apos;s not that easy .
i mean , we &apos;re talking interest , penalties ,
and a potential criminal investigation .
but i am willing to forgot all that
if we can come to a swift agreement .
51 % controlling interest in nolcorp
and your continued good faith service as its c.e.o.
and visionary .
and ...
if i refuse ?
then i &apos;ll dispatch an army of forensic accountants
to hunt down every missing penny of that $ 500 million .
and something tells me ,
you don &apos;t want me finding out where it ended up .
well @-@ played , boss .
guess it looks like i work for grayson global now .
see you around , marco .
success suits you .
i don &apos;t remember you ever looking more dashing .
wall street &apos;s new golden boy .
it &apos;s not like i did it alone .
now that nolcorp is secure ,
i can bring aiden back in .
mr. grobet seemed to take a shine to him .
he should be the one to deliver the good news .
no , it should be you .
you &apos;re the one that found nolan &apos;s former c.f.o.
and you obviously didn &apos;t trust aiden enough
to include him in the final negotiations .
listen , if aiden &apos;s gonna be my man on the board ,
i want him building a rapport with its most powerful member .
besides , without him ,
i never would &apos;ve connected the dots to nolcorp .
and he would be the first to tell you .
daniel ...
i can &apos;t sit back and watch you get played
by another grayson wannabe .
not after what happened with tyler .
remember him ?
i &apos;ve spent the past year trying to forget him . mm .
i &apos;m only suggesting that you take things slow with him ,
make sure he &apos;s been properly vetted
before he gets in any deeper .
白天深藏她的背叛行为 晚上在睡梦中供认罪行
hello , lady macbeth .
ah , right on cue .
evening , daniel .
is this a bad time ?
no , just going over some details for your pitch to the board .
uh , what &apos;s up ?
listen , give yourself the night off .
i &apos;ll take lead on prep for the vote .
when should we convene ?
i &apos;ll get back to you on that .
but thanks for all your support .
my pleasure .
ashley &apos;s turning daniel against you .
that &apos;s the problem . what &apos;s the solution ?
we turn daniel against ashley .
okay , ems .
i can &apos;t say you didn &apos;t warn me about that tricky little bastard .
god , danny boy really learned how to play dirty .
it &apos;s in his d.n.a.
is the video encrypted yet ?
uploading now .
and ...
adios , ash .
which should put your pale british shadow
back in danny &apos;s good graces .
top of the morning , mathis .
ross . look , what happened yesterday was beyond regrettable .
so , uh , we all got played . my apologies .
yeah , well , just get your board seat back
so i can pull the rip cord on my golden parachute .
fyi , file &apos;s uploading now .
if she doesn &apos;t open it in five minutes ...
it opens itself .
off to the chapel .
coming , ems ?
so ...
in the midst of a maelstrom ,
you still have time for a christening .
who is this porter fellow to you anyway ?
an old friend .
old friend , that all he is ?
could &apos;ve been something more .
at ... one point almost was .
but it wasn &apos;t meant to be .
another casualty of what we do .
hey , you don &apos;t have to keep secrets from me .
i &apos;m not .
it &apos;s okay if you want to , but ...
you don &apos;t have to .
i know .
old habits .
look , i &apos;ll be , uh , right here when you get back .
mr. grobet , what a lovely surprise .
and for me as well .
i assume that you spoke with daniel .
i did , and i &apos;m very impressed .
good . i &apos;m pleased .
mr. grobet , i thought i heard your voice .
you must be looking for conrad .
yes . i &apos;m sorry that i dropped in unannounced .
is he home ?
he is . he &apos;s in his study . he &apos;ll be thrilled to see you .
we &apos;re still on track , i presume .
i should speak to your husband .
ms. davenport .
always a pleasure , mr. grobet .
heavenly father ,
surround this child with your love ,
and protect him from evil .
who are the godparents ?
declan foster porter .
emily rebecca thorne .
do you renounce satan and all his empty promises ?
do you vow to protect this child ,
to stave off sin , and shield him from evil ?
promise .
promise .
please .
i baptize thee , carl ,
in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy ghost .
dearest father in heaven , bless this child ...
smile upon this child and surround this child , lord ,
with the soft mantle of your love ...
matt duncan ?
hey . what a surprise , man .
great to see you .
i thought you moved your family down to florida .
i @-@ i hope you don &apos;t mind me crashing .
aw , are you kidding ? it &apos;s great to see you .
it &apos;s been way too long .
yeah .
what are the ryan brothers doing here ?
oh , kenny ryan bought in to the bar .
you know those guys ?
yeah , and listen to me ,
get yourself out of that deal .
what are you talking about ?
i woulda lost the bar if it weren &apos;t for their help .
they don &apos;t help anybody .
and they sure as hell didn &apos;t come to your bar by accident .
trust me , jack .
get &apos; em out .
see you around , kid . congrats .
listen , i don &apos;t deny
that you have helped make me a very wealthy man .
using your wife &apos;s money to do it .
tell me , what--what can you possibly not afford
that these newfound millions might bring you ?
good question , conrad .
perhaps i &apos;ll leave it to you to find an answer .
oh , well , then , you &apos;re still persuadable ?
not by anything you possess .
well ?
he &apos;s going with daniel .
don &apos;t pretend for one second
that you give a damn about that boy .
a clue , perhaps , as to what the hell you &apos;re talking about ?
see for yourself .
you have wormed your way
into the very nadir of repugnance .
where did you get this ?
from whoever seems to be circling this family
with an endless catalog of our sins .
sex with your son &apos;s girlfriend ? really , conrad .
you and i were divorced at the time--
oh , so you say .
it could &apos;ve happened this morning for all i know .
oh , what are you suggesting ,
that fidelity is one of your strong points ?
and as for daniel , he had yet to commence ...
his misguided relationship with dear ms. davenport .
a relationship you allowed to proceed
without mentioning your own pathetic lack of impulse control .
we can discuss how that theoretical father @-@ son chat
would have unfolded at a later date .
right now , we have more pressing problems .
our upwardly mobile son
not only closed the nolcorp deal ,
he managed to wrest a controlling interest
in that company ,
seemingly without impediment ,
which brings us to this little video
that was so conveniently dispatched to you
right in the midst of our current crisis .
now what is the one entity with the only real ability to make
and the motive to use this recording ?
the initiative .
they know that as long as you and i remain united ,
we just might have the strength to ensure
daniel doesn &apos;t win that vote tomorrow .
victoria , they are trying to drive a wedge between us
because they sense a change in the headwinds .
they &apos;re going all in on daniel , aren &apos;t they ?
yeah , so if you must ,
you may unload your usual rain of hellfire on me
once this ordeal is over , but until we prevail ,
i would advise you to focus your considerable powers
on rescuing our son .
my parents aren &apos;t exactly
the best role models in the world ,
which shouldn &apos;t surprise anyone who reads the internet ,
watches tv , is alive .
on the plus side , it makes it really easy for me
to spot good parents .
and that &apos;s exactly why my nephew
is the luckiest little guy in the world .
i need to go .
emily , wait up .
you &apos;re just taking off without telling anyone .
you were surrounded by family . i didn &apos;t want to break it up .
you &apos;re my family , too .
i saw you at church ...
how you looked at jack and me .
you &apos;re wrong .
you deserve something like what we have .
maybe .
but it &apos;s not my time . not yet .
why , &apos; cause your off on another mission
to destroying someone else &apos;s life ?
i &apos;m not destroying lives , amanda .
i &apos;m righting wrongs .
tell yourself whatever you have to ,
but when will enough be enough ?
look , just say good @-@ bye to jack for me .
envisioning your future ?
i didn &apos;t know that you were there .
undoubtedly . mm .
i used to do the very same thing .
plan out my path ,
identify the obstacles ,
visualize the next six months ,
one year , five years ...
and as a result ,
all those thoughts became this .
you &apos;ve made yourself quite at home at grayson manor
as of late .
i do my best to keep out of your way .
that &apos;s debatable .
still , i was hoping that you could assist me
with a matter that &apos;s come to my attention .
yes .
i had that reaction , too .
please , you must understand ...
which part , that you seduced my husband ,
or that you hid it from my all @-@ too @-@ trusting son ?
it happened one time . you had just fired me .
it was a terrible mistake .
on that , we are in violent agreement .
he offered to help me-- money , a @-@ a job .
put yourself in the same position .
can you honestly say that you wouldn &apos;t have done
the exact same thing ?
oh , well , my judgment &apos;s not in question here ,
nor my future .
and we both know it would be
a simple pleasure to annihilate you .
please , victoria .
don &apos;t destroy what i have with daniel .
i love him .
i swear , i will do anything to put this right .
i &apos;m counting on it .
now ...
you know where mr. grobet is staying , don &apos;t you ?
yes .
call him .
slight hiccup in the plan ,
and by &quot; slight , &quot; i mean massive .
victoria &apos;s gonna exploit ashley &apos;s plight
to her advantage .
what ? how ?
by sending her to salvador &apos;s bed .
and if ashley manages to convince him ...
to change his mind about daniel ...
conrad wins the vote .
and we lose our biggest link to the initiative .
no .
that &apos;s not an option .
wow . where are you off to ?
i forgot that i have to butter up some donors
for the heal the sound benefit .
but i won &apos;t be long .
good . i &apos;m liable to get jealous
with you out dressed like this .
something wrong ?
daniel , no one &apos;s ever been kinder to me than you .
i just want you to know how much that means to me .
well , that &apos;s nice . you &apos;re welcome , babe .
now hurry up so you can get back here .
is she on her way ?
she just left . you &apos;re good to go .
aiden , what &apos;s up ?
how soon can you get to the cooper &apos;s neck inn ?
20 minutes . is there a problem ?
not on the phone .
i &apos;m on my way .
thanks for coming , nolan .
i know you &apos;re a busy guy .
not for much longer .
look , you &apos;re , uh ...
you &apos;re good at finding out stuff about people , right ?
i think i might have a little problem on my hands
with the guy who bought in to the bar and his brother .
text me their names , and i &apos;ll ...
nolan .
um , jack , could we ...
could we pick this up later ?
thanks .
marco .
what , did you come to collect the knife
you left in my back ?
oh , it &apos;s not your usual hangout last i remember .
oh , well , a lot of things have changed
since you walked out the door .
please . you mean since you threw me out .
so is this--is this really where amanda clarke lives ?
she never saw a penny of that fortune
you allegedly put aside for her , did she ?
you obviously think you have a trump card , marco .
why don &apos;t you go ahead and play it ?
okay .
getting fired from nolcorp before the i.p.o.
basically trashed my career .
i am tired of living hand to mouth .
well , i offered you a payout ,
which you threw back in my face , literally .
i didn &apos;t want a payout , nolan .
i want my old job back .
i helped to build nolcorp from the ground up ,
and you know that .
and you just helped tear it down ,
so no dice .
plus ...
the position &apos;s already been filled .
padma is so much better for me than you ever were .
why , because she &apos;s easier to fool ?
padma knows exactly who i am .
i &apos;ve told her everything .
except for the fact that you &apos;re allowing amanda clarke
and your best friend to live above a bar ,
cueless about the money that &apos;s rightfully hers .
ms. davenport ...
i understand you have a proposition for me .
may i come in ?
please do .
you &apos;ll find a glass of champagne waiting for you
on the nightstand .
all right . what &apos;s going on ?
i want to know why you left me out
of the final negotiations with nolcorp .
i thought we were partners .
we were working together .
partners is taking it a bit far .
without my efforts , the nolcorp acquisition
would never have gotten off the launchpad .
why are you suddenly questioning my loyalty ?
the truth ?
bcause i &apos;ve only known you for a few weeks ,
and i &apos;ve been advised to have you further vetted .
advised by whom ?
what , your girlfriend ?
because if she &apos;s the bar by which you measure fidelity ,
then there &apos;s something you need to know .
daniel .
ashley .
hey , you shouldn &apos;t be here .
ashley .
daniel ?
no , it &apos;s--daniel , this isn &apos;t what you think it is .
then what is it exactly , huh ?
oh , let me guess . my father sent you here
to screw grobet for his vote , didn &apos;t he ?
no , no , no .
is that what happened ?
no , no ! no , that &apos;s not--
you &apos;ve been working for him this whole time , haven &apos;t you ?
no , no , i haven &apos;t .
no , daniel , please listen to me .
daniel , listen .
no-- save it . get off of me !
hey , that &apos;s enough !
you disgust me !
hey , please .
you listen to me , you son of a bitch .
unless you want me to hand your wife the easiest ,
and for you , the costliest divorce in history ,
your vote is mine tomorrow .
get your stuff out of my house , ashley .
congratulations , miss thorne .
i do believe , this time tomorrow ,
grayson global will be coronating a new king .
oh , hey , francine .
excuse me .
salvador ,
i trust last night left conrad in good standing with you .
unfortunately for your husband ,
it seems daniel inherited twice your ruthlessness .
i &apos;ll side with the boy ,
and those loyal to me will follow .
he &apos;s won , hasn &apos;t he ?
yes .
but we have one card left to play .
what , tell him the truth ?
it &apos;d be like signing his death warrant .
daniel , before you go in there ,
please give us five minutes .
you &apos;ve got two .
i &apos;ve known you two
to be capable of some pretty vile things ,
but you &apos;ve outdone yourselves this time .
now what the hell are you holding over ashley
that would compel her to degrade herself like this ?
whatever ashley did or didn &apos;t do is irrelevant .
the truth is ...
the truth ?
coming from you ?
victoria .
the truth is ,
that i will do whatever it takes to protect you .
i recognize that you &apos;re ambitious , but you are young .
and as your mother ,
as the one person who loves you more than anyone in this world ,
i beseech you to call off this vote--
and why would i do that ?
winning that vote today will put you in unspeakable danger .
fine .
tell me what kind of danger i &apos;m in .
come on . make me believe you .
i can &apos;t .
as expected .
the depths you &apos;ll go to stay in power are shameless .
mr. duncan .
hey , declan .
we , uh , we missed you at the reception .
yeah , it was a beautiful ceremony , though .
your dad would &apos;ve been proud .
is , uh , jack around ?
i thought i remembered he lived on the boat .
yeah . well , no .
n--i live here now , ever since the baby came .
did you check the bar ? he &apos;s probably just opening up .
oh , yeah . right . i &apos;ll do that .
it &apos;s just--it , um ...
are his business partners around ?
nate and kenny ?
yeah .
should be here any minute .
want me to walk up with you ?
know what ?
i left the baby &apos;s gift in the backseat .
i @-@ i gotta go get it . i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
well , well . hey , kenny . look who it is .
you remember matt duncan .
sure do .
been a long time .
i don &apos;t have anything to say to you boys .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
we got a lot of questions for you ,
mainly about what happened to our old man six years ago .
i don &apos;t know anything about it .
see , we don &apos;t believe that &apos;s true .
you know why ?
&apos;cause the last thing he says to us was ,
he had a meeting right here with your old pal carl porter .
same night your kid was sideswiped by a car .
after that , we never heard from him again .
i spent that night in the hospital .
that &apos;s not the whole story , is it ?
tell you what . why don &apos;t we go settle this like men ?
see if i can &apos;t find a way to jog your memory .
thank you so much .
it &apos;s over .
salvador voted with daniel ,
and the board did the same .
so it &apos;s official .
he &apos;s the new c.e.o ..
mr. grobet ,
thank you for your vote .
i suggest you smile and shake my hand .
in addition to nolcorp ,
my other acquisition today was your loyalty .
don &apos;t forget that .
all right .
emily , what a nice surprise .
daniel , i hear congratulations are in order .
oh , thank you .
i think i may have found my calling .
what brings you to the city ?
actually , i was just hoping to steal aiden for a bit .
well , he &apos;s your man .
i just need him for two seconds .
absolutely .
victoria , conrad .
i bet you &apos;re so proud .
i know i am .
congratulations i knew you could do it .
aiden , i couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
thank you .
which makes this bit of bad news
all the more difficult to deliver .
my leadership was not the only piece of new business
that came to pass today .
the board also elected to close ranks
while the company goes through this transition .
meaning ?
meaning there &apos;s no room for you on the board
unless someone willingly vacates ,
and i don &apos;t see that happening anytime soon ,
as the nolcorp deal
just increased our bottom line by 30 % .
but , hey , look on the bright side .
i &apos;m sure this will come
as a considerable relief to mr. takeda ,
who &apos;s just regained your full attention .
have fun with emily today .
yeah .
he &apos;s finally down .
what you lookin &apos; for ?
my dad &apos;s address book
so i can send out thank @-@ yous for all the christening gifts .
have you seen it ?
no . did you ask declan ?
no . hey , man .
jack .
look , i am sorry to be the bearer of troubling news ,
but i did that research
you asked for on your new business partners .
does the name joe ryan mean anything to you ?
wait . wait a minute .
are--are you saying they &apos;re related to that joe ryan ?
i am telling you , he &apos;s their father .
i dug up an article from november of &apos; 06 .
his body washed up on gin beach . he &apos;d been--
shot to death . i know .
they never found the person who did it .
yeah , well ,
looks like your new buddy nate took a page from dad &apos;s playbook .
he just wrapped up a 5 @-@ year vacay at rikers for drug trafficking .
and as for kenny , the guy doesn &apos;t own a house in southampton .
he sublets a 1 @-@ bedroom in sag harbor .
jack , these guys are seriously bad dudes .
there &apos;s a man out there covered in blood . i think he &apos;s dying .
i @-@ i gotta call you back .
jack--
stay with the baby !
no , jack--
keep your eyes open . come on . stay awake .
stay up . come on .
mr. duncan !
what happened ?
i don &apos;t know . i found him like this .
is he dead ?
no .
keep him conscious . i &apos;m calling 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
no .
no cops .
get her outta here .
charlotte , come on .
the--the ryans ...
they did this to you ?
their old man , they ... think your dad killed him .
that &apos;s crazy .
my dad would never do something like that .
he didn &apos;t . i did .
i used his gun .
he hid it on your boat to protect me .
they &apos;re not your friends , jack .
they want payback .
needless to say ,
you were right to keep daniel in the dark this afternoon .
the boy will soon run the company toward the ground ,
proving little use to the initiative .
on the contrary .
i think he handled himself very well today .
seemingly .
but his vaulting ambition
will bring him down as swiftly as it propped him up .
what the hell was that for ?
take your pick .
evening , jack .
thought we should check on you guys .
heard there was a little incident earlier .
yeah .
decided to close up early . people were pretty spooked .
yeah . looks like it .
is it true some old @-@ timer nearly bought it out there ?
some friend of your father &apos;s or something ?
matt duncan .
luckily i got him to the hospital in time .
yeah , lucky for him . you &apos;re a good samaritan , jack .
most people wouldn &apos;t get involved .
did he say who did it ?
no . never saw &apos; em . he got jumped from behind .
guess we should all keep our eyes open then .
yeah , speaking of which ,
i accidentally picked up your pop &apos;s black book off the bar today .
he--
he &apos;s a real popular guy , your old man , huh ?
that was a nice christening today .
sleep tight .
jack ...
what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
go back to bed .
lock the doors . i &apos;ll be up in a minute .
last one .
good .
my hand is cramping .
so it &apos;s done .
we &apos;re an official subsidiary of grayson global .
yeah , well , forgive me if i don &apos;t feel like
cracking open the champagne . mm .
nolan , i &apos;m sorry .
i feel responsible .
don &apos;t .
remember when i asked you how far you &apos;d be willing to go
to defend this company ?
first rule of dirty dealing , always have a contingency plan
that bites your opponent in the ass
harder than they bit you .
what kind of plan ?
just know that i have no intention
of letting those bastards profit off david clarke .
but why wait ? why not hit them now ?
it &apos;s much easier to destroy a castle from inside its walls .
huh . suddenly i &apos;ve become--
a trojan horse .
oh , when i &apos;m finished ,
young daniel won &apos;t know what hit him .
always burning the midnight oil .
should i call security ?
that &apos;s a good question , nolan .
um , padma ...
marco and i are ... in talks
to find him a position within the company .
what ?
after what he did ?
that &apos;s insane .
actually , it &apos;s just smart business .
right , nolan ?
do you think it &apos;s possible for people like us to ever be--
like everybody else ?
i was gonna say &quot; happy . &quot;
maybe not completely .
but right now i &apos;m happy .
being with you is the only time i &apos;ve ever felt peace .
revelations can help us accept the things we need the most ...
expose the secrets we so desperately try to hide ...
and illuminate the dangers all around us .
but more than anything ,
revelations are windows into our true selves ...
both the good ...
and the evil ...
and those weavering somewhere in between
everything is in place .
with the ultimate power to destroy all that we cherish most .
shall we put the plan to a vote ?

who was that ?
leverage .
