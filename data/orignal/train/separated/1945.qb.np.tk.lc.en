&quot; one flight down &quot;
a surgical residency
is all about training for the worst .
but as prepared as we might be ,
we usually don &apos;t see disaster coming .
we can try to envision the worst @-@ case scenario
to foresee catastrophe .
kepner , where is everyone ?
anyone in particular ?
well , page everyone now . a plane went down .
a small one , but it crashed right in the middle of the city .
i didn &apos;t hear anything about --
there it is .
let &apos;s move , people !
hey .
hi .
but when true disaster strikes , it often comes out of nowhere .
amelia .
i just don &apos;t think this -- us -- is a good idea .
mixing work and play .
play ?
play ? what am i now , some screw ?
i didn &apos;t say that .
this is more .
amelia , you and i both know this is more .
i don &apos;t have any more to give .
i &apos;m not trying to hurt you .
i &apos;m not hurt .
i get it .
and ...
i &apos;m done .
and when the worst really does happen ...
owen . - you don &apos;t want real . you want the -- the play .
you want the high . you want the rush .
and i &apos;m not doing that . i &apos;m not interested , so i &apos;m done .
amelia ...
i &apos;ve had enough .
we need to set up a central triage area .
walking wounded can go to the ambulatory care center .
... we find ourselves completely blindsided .
hi . you &apos;ve reached dr. shepherd .
please leave a message , and i will return your call .
hey .
so , i just got off the phone with the white house ,
and apparently you missed your meeting .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ,
but you probably owe them
a phone call , i think .
watch out ! coming through !
slow down ! what &apos;s your problem ?
sorry . there was a plane crash .
this is gonna be so good .
we are probably looking at piles of crush injuries , burns .
compound fractures .
if we &apos;re lucky .
move it or lose it , ladies !
i need you to be still .
wilson , i need a little help here .
shut up ! shut up !
derek !
grey .
grey , need a hand .
i flew a plane . i had the controls in my hands .
i don &apos;t know how to fly a plane , and i flew a freaking plane !
we were in a plane , and it crashed .
the plane crashed .
all i could see was freaking sky !
are you the pilot ?
no , no , sam .
sam &apos;s the pilot . where -- where is he ?
where -- where is sam ?
i don &apos;t know ! i only have one shoe !
oh , god , sam .
transfer her on my count . one , two , three .
i need a trauma panel , c @-@ spine , chest , and pelvis .
edwards , grab the ultrasound .
he had a heart attack or s @-@ something .
something happened to him , and i had to try .
i had to try to land the plane .
visualize the paracolic gutter .
um , what &apos;s your -- what &apos;s your name ? - kate .
okay , kate ?
yeah .
we &apos;re gonna find your husband ,
but first we &apos;re gonna -- we &apos;re gonna take care of you .
make sure you check for fluid in morrison &apos;s pouch .
he &apos;s not my husband .
it was a -- it was a date . - smaller movements .
uh , a first date from that site where you --
where you put down what kind of date you want to go on .
and then you meet the person , and then you go do it .
what about that ?
yeah . yeah , i see it .
we &apos;re almost done here .
i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve been on a bunch of those dates ,
and it &apos;s always bowling or something that sounds fun ,
but then turns out to be dumb .
this guy -- this guy &apos;s , like , &quot; let &apos;s go up in my plane . &quot;
and i &apos;m , like , &quot; why not ? &quot;
grey , over here .
and it was -- was perfect .
he turned out to be nice and funny ,
and we were up in the sky ,
and i &apos;ve never felt like that before .
not even with guys i &apos;ve been out with a bunch .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s amazing . he &apos;s am--
is he gonna be okay ?
i just -- like , i don &apos;t want to lose him .
i just found him . i @-@ i just found him .
derek !
i heard your voice . i thought i was dreaming .
grey ? grey ?
where are we at ?
she &apos;s got free fluid in the belly .
we &apos;re gonna have to take her up to for a head c.t.
and get her to the o.r.
page shepherd . - sam --
he &apos;s not dead , right ?
where is derek ? !
please .
he can &apos;t die .
have you seen dr. robbins ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
alex , where &apos;s robbins ?
i don &apos;t know . what do you need , a consult ?
i need robbins .
there -- there was a plane crash .
i know .
but we &apos;re okay .
&apos;cause it &apos;s not us .
it &apos;s not us , so we &apos;re -- we &apos;re okay .
we are okay .
we are -- we are okay .
did you see the guy out there ?
his leg is severed beneath the knee .
did you -- did you see him ?
i did .
we &apos;re okay .
the girl , she can &apos;t find her boyfriend .
we &apos;re okay .
we &apos;re okay .
you &apos;re awake .
i am now .
don &apos;t pretend staring at me like that isn &apos;t creepy because it is .
is it sexy creepy or just --
how long have you been awake ? it &apos;s -- it &apos;s still dark out .
a little while . not too long .
your snoring woke me up .
i don &apos;t snore anymore .
you know , in d.c. ,
i could hear the metro station from my apartment .
the trains would wake me up every morning .
this is a much better way to wake up .
yeah ?
your snoring is like a train .
it &apos;s much cuter .
i don &apos;t snore .
yes , you do . it &apos;s like music .
it &apos;s like a birdsong .
a loud , gargling bird .
on a train .
they just keep coming . is that the pilot ?
yeah , sam garrett , 36 . bp &apos;s 90 palp . tachy at 120 .
probable abdominal injuries .
then let &apos;s get him in .
uh , have you seen , uh , meredith or arizona today ?
they -- they okay ? - no . i haven &apos;t .
there ought to be some rule
that people who have been in a plane crash can &apos;t work on one .
that &apos;s not a bad idea .
we should , uh , you know ,
look out for them today , you know ?
yes .
oh , uh , no .
no , um , i can &apos;t .
i mean , i want to , but i can &apos;t be that person for arizona .
it &apos;s , uh -- it &apos;s not my place , you know .
not anymore .
right . yeah . okay .
yeah .
i need tocolytics for bed 6 .
one of the overflows needs a fetal monitor ,
and i need you to call labor and delivery
and have them prep for a &quot; c &quot; that &apos;s heading their way .
right away .
oh , my g--
don &apos;t do that to people !
sorry . you okay ?
are you kidding ? of course i &apos;m not okay .
well , i figured . look --
a plane crashes into a whole prenatal yoga class ?
i mean , what are the odds of that ?
wait . what ?
we were just doing triangle pose ,
and there was this crash ,
and a car came right through the window .
it was terrifying .
okay , um , moms one and two are possible labors .
mom three is hypertensive .
mom four is possible labor ,
or she &apos;s freaking out .
why wouldn &apos;t she be ?
and mom five is a small abruption
that might require a section .
i mean --
yeah , you don &apos;t really seem okay .
you need a hand ?
no .
i &apos;m just in the weeds here .
yeah , you need a hand .
kate ...
she was so good . she was amazing .
abdominal distension . diffused tenderness .
he needs a scan and a cardio consult .
a guy has a heart attack , crashes his plane .
it &apos;s a miracle he &apos;s still talking .
it wasn &apos;t me . it was kate . she was the miracle .
my chest felt like a load of bricks on it .
i couldn &apos;t move . she just took over .
i tried to talk her through the landing ,
but ... she was so brave .
she just did it .
dr. grey ? is this sam ?
this is sam .
kate won &apos;t stop talking about him . how is he ?
uh , you &apos;ve seen her ? is she okay ?
we &apos;re taking very good care of her . don &apos;t you worry .
i &apos;m gonna marry that girl .
uh , i think the feeling &apos;s mutual .
that sounds crazy , but i will .
i &apos;m gonna marry her .
oh , his pressure &apos;s bottomed out .
we need to get him upstairs now .
hang another unit on the infuser .
tell me again .
he likes you .
one , two , three .
he gushed .
he said he was gonna marry you .
oh , my god .
i know .
he has these pretty eyes where you can &apos;t tell
if they &apos;re green or hazel or blue or what ,
but against the sky , they &apos;re blue .
and he was looking at me ,
and he asked me if i was ready to fly .
and the next thing i know , we were up in the air .
he said flying is his favorite thing in the world ,
and he &apos;s so excited , and he was so good at it .
like , this is what he was born to do .
i fell . right then .
i knew i was looking at the love of my life .
and we were flying ,
and the air was underneath us and clouds all around us , and --
i mean , this doesn &apos;t happen , right ?
first dates like this , guys like this ?
up until now , i would have said no .
but -- but then he started grabbing his chest ,
and then we were falling out of the sky .
it &apos;s not fair .
it &apos;s not fair .
hey . heard you two caught the pilot .
yeah , we did . going in on him now .
you good ? you okay ?
i &apos;m fine .
&apos;cause , you know , there was a plane crash ,
and i just thought maybe --
for about a year after the crash ,
arizona had nightmares ,
and if i &apos;d come home even 10 minutes late , she &apos;d freak out ,
so i just wanted to see if you &apos;re doing okay .
derek missed his meeting in d.c. ,
and i haven &apos;t heard from him .
that &apos;s not weird .
okay .
it &apos;s not like i should have heard from him . i --
we don &apos;t call each other every second .
we &apos;re not those people .
i &apos;m a surgeon . i &apos;m busy .
he &apos;s in d.c. he &apos;s busy .
so it &apos;s fine that i haven &apos;t heard from him .
it &apos;s not a thing .
it &apos;s the plane crash , meredith .
the plane crash is making you worry .
i know . i know .
you &apos;ll call me if she --
just call me .
for a while , i would facetime cristina .
i would prop her up right there where your head is now .
half the time , she was in surgery ,
so i would just watch her operate until i drifted off .
i brought the kids in the bed for a while
so we could all sleep together .
i printed a tumor , and i slept with that there for a bit .
it &apos;s just weird . i ...
that pillow &apos;s been empty for such a long time .
not now . not anymore .
i know .
i just wished you didn &apos;t have to go back to d.c. at all .
i wish you could just stay right here , right now .
it &apos;s my last trip , and then i &apos;m back for good .
i promise .
i know .
i &apos;ve missed you .
i missed us .
i have , too .
okay , let &apos;s pack all four quadrants .
can you feel the mesentery ?
grey .
did you find the mesentery ?
oh , i was just -- sorry .
dr. grey , do you need to be replaced ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not fine . you &apos;re distracted .
you and derek went down in a plane .
you drowned . he got shot .
you gave birth in a power outage .
is this supposed to make me feel better ?
i &apos;m just saying , you have every reason to be distracted ,
every reason to think the sky is falling .
do you need to go ?
no !
okay , well , how long can you go
without hearing from him before you absolutely go crazy ?
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i -- 6 : 00 , 6 : 30 , maybe .
okay , then , let &apos;s say 5 : 00 .
at 5 : 00 p.m. , if you haven &apos;t heard from him ,
you can panic .
you can call the police , call the paramedics .
you can freak out until your little heart &apos;s content .
but not one minute before and not in this o.r.
can you do that ?
5 : 00 p.m.
5 : 00 p.m.
yes .
okay .
so , it &apos;s kind of an amazing story .
it was their first date , and they both --
chief , in or out , please ?
i just need to know if kate is good to go to the o.r.
for abdominal surgery .
i &apos;m looking .
please look fast . i &apos;m on a timeframe here .
i will not hold you up .
because this lady will bleed out if i don &apos;t get her up there .
yes , i am aware you are impatient .
i can &apos;t make it my problem .
does the patient have a brain bleed or not ?
she looks clear .
edwards , take her up to o.r. 2 .
kind of amazing about these two , isn &apos;t it ?
they meet for all of 20 minutes and just fall in love .
i &apos;m not someone who believes in fate or anything like that ,
but it kind of makes you wonder , doesn &apos;t it ?
or maybe not .
maybe they &apos;re both crazy .
but even then , that &apos;s what my grandma used to say ,
that that &apos;s what love is all about ,
that everyone is crazy in their own way .
and the trick is finding someone
whose crazy complements your own .
edwards , let &apos;s just work without all the talking .
edwards , what ?
well , i have questions about the procedure .
you &apos;re supposed to allow me to ask questions ,
and i &apos;m supposed to learn .
i have a right to learn .
i &apos;m not -- - instead , you &apos;re silencing me .
i &apos;ve been silenced . it &apos;s unprofessional .
just because you &apos;re having personal issues
with a co @-@ worker , with a neurosurgeon ,
it &apos;s not fair that you silence my voice .
fine , fine ! what is your question ?
well , when you glare at me like that , i can &apos;t remember it .
i actually felt it before i saw it .
even small planes have that engine power , you know ,
the kind that vibrates inside your chest .
did it seem like something was wrong ?
as soon as i looked up ,
i immediately knew the descent was in trouble .
th @-@ the drag , th @-@ the thrust , the angle .
practically scraped my roof . i @-@ i couldn &apos;t believe it .
well , how close were you again ?
uh , i @-@ i should , you know ,
probably see how they &apos;re doing in the e.r.
oh , i thought torres was down here .
i need a consult .
uh , no , she &apos;s in o.r. 6 .
hey , uh , are you working with arizona today ?
is she doing okay ?
yeah , well , i mean , she keeps yelling at me to do crap ,
so i guess that &apos;s normal .
anyone know how mer &apos;s doing ?
uh , they , um --
they had a bad experience on a plane a while back .
oh . yeah , i get that . i hate flying .
my flight out here from boston was the worst .
there was some technical problem with the plane ,
and so they left us on the tarmac for four hours .
and they wouldn &apos;t let anybody out their seats to use the bathroom .
they weren &apos;t serving water , and it was so hot .
it smelled like boiled feet .
and then !
after four hours , they just canceled the flight .
i mean , they just kicked us off .
there was no apology . there was no --
what ?
you tell her .
oh , okay . um ...
here we go .
looking good here . how are we doing there ?
looking good so far .
let &apos;s unpack , check what we have .
pressure &apos;s droping .
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . oh , no .
there &apos;s no blood in the abdomen .
he &apos;s throwing pvc &apos;s .
and his pressure is still dropping .
he &apos;s going into cardiogenic shock from the heart attack .
he might be having a repeat m.i.
get pierce up here now .
meredith &apos;s sister ?
yeah .
and that &apos;s how arizona lost her leg .
i never wanted to ask .
callie had to amputate .
she would have died if , uh , the leg didn &apos;t come off .
it would have killed her .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
cutting the pericardium .
suction .
here .
okay , good . that did it .
what are you doing ?
uh , acute m.i. cardiac tamponade .
his ventricle ruptured .
you need to plug the hole .
i &apos;m trying . i can &apos;t find it .
suction .
stick your hand in there .
there you are .
gown me .
don &apos;t move .
he &apos;s barely perfusing . are you compressing hard enough ?
i know how to compress a heart .
watch my finger .
okay , grey , you &apos;d do well to remember
who you talking to before you get smacked .
i need a patch , pledgets , and 3 @-@ 0 prolene .
his tissue &apos;s pretty friable . you sure a patch will hold ?
it has to .
in a perfect world , i &apos;d put him on bypass
and stop his heart completely ,
give myself plenty of time to make sure
that i am sewing up healthy tissue .
no . no bypass ?
well , we have to do a splenectomy
and a partial hepatectomy in order to salvage the liver .
if we put him on bypass , we &apos;ll have to heparinize him ,
and he &apos;ll bleed out on the table .
i know .
there &apos;s nothing i like more than being painted into a corner .
that &apos;s the spirit . let &apos;s be optimistic , shall we ?
okay .
meredith , i &apos;m gonna need you to lift your finger on my count .
one , two , three .
ugh .
we managed to fix the intestinal tears
without having to resect the bowel .
you &apos;re actually pretty lucky .
with the kind of sudden impact you took ,
it could have been a lot worse .
yeah , oh , and just so you know , sam still is in surgery ,
but he is in excellent hands ,
and we will let you know as soon as we have more news .
s @-@ sam ?
yeah , sam , your date .
the pilot of the plane .
what plane ?
why do you -- you keep talking about a plane ?
what happened to me ?
please , tell me what happened to me .
temporary memory loss is very common in situations like this .
oh , that &apos;s your assessment , that this is all just temporary ?
it &apos;s my opinion and my hope .
but i will do a repeat c.t. and a neuro check every hour .
and you &apos;re sure you didn &apos;t miss anything in the first c.t. ?
i didn &apos;t miss anything on the first c.t.
because there wasn &apos;t anything to see ,
but she could have had a post @-@ surgery stroke
or an evolving intracerebral contusion .
so you &apos;re saying this was my fault .
i &apos;m saying this is no one &apos;s fault .
this kind of thing happens all the time .
do the c.t. let me know when you have the results .
hey , mom four looks okay to me .
i think you can discharge her when you &apos;re done here .
thanks .
who do we got ?
uh , mom one , possible labor turned into definite labor .
great . need help ?
no .
um , no , yeah . check on mom two .
i just started her on nifedipine .
do what you got to do , but you keep that baby in there .
what ?
nothing .
then go . go . go , go !
okay , you may feel a little sting here ,
but we are almost done , okay ?
no , i could tell right away there was a problem .
the pitch , the -- the air speed , and i &apos;m wondering ,
where does this pilot think he &apos;s gonna land this bird ?
but then it &apos;s too late .
the thing just roars right over my head
and crashed in the street right behind me .
right behind you ?
hmm ? uh -- uh -- behind ?
yeah , well , a little back , a little beyond .
i mean , o @-@ of course , we &apos;re moving in opposite directions .
wow .
and then i &apos;m racing to the e.r.
to prep it for the first casualties
and just thanking god i &apos;m alive .
i mean , i knew that they were stranded out there ,
but what they went through ?
they gave dr. sloan a pericardiocentesis
with , like , a drinking straw .
they all almost died .
it was love at first sight . it &apos;s real , and they had it .
who ?
kate and sam , the plane @-@ crash couple . oh .
they had it , and now she can &apos;t remember any of it or him
or any of their amazing , unicorn @-@ magical first date .
did you know that it was torres who sawed off arizona &apos;s leg ?
that &apos;s what happened ?
yes , and it &apos;s so weird because now we know them .
they &apos;re like real people , and they were in a plane crash .
oh , oh , and alex used to hook up with grey &apos;s sister .
pierce ? she wasn &apos;t even here .
no , there was another one , lexie .
was ?
she died out there in the woods .
oh , my god . what if sam dies ?
what if kate never remembers ?
what if -- what if shepherd made the wrong call
because she &apos;s so pissed at hunt , and hunt &apos;s so pissed at her ,
and he dies , and kate doesn &apos;t remember any of it ?
like , it never even happened ?
like poof , gone , just evaporated like it was nothing ?
i can never look at any of them the same again .
never .
yeah , that woman is never gonna find this kind of love again .
ever .
hey , who is that ? where &apos;d you get that baby ?
it came flying out of mom two .
i told you to keep that baby in .
i tried . she didn &apos;t respond to the meds .
little bugger apparently wanna out .
wha-- how &apos;s his mom ?
oh , she &apos;s doing great . easy delivery .
all right , i &apos;ll check on her after my section on mom five .
you need a hand with that ?
no , i &apos;m fine .
well , i mean , it &apos;s not a problem if you want an assist .
no , i got it . - well , no , i mean --
no , alex !
just get that baby settled in the nicu and this one , too .
okay , last suture going in .
okay . you can let go ...
now .
damn it ! damn it .
it &apos;s not holding .
so much for optimism and joy .
what now ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe there &apos;s a way we can put him on bypass after all .
are you out of your mind ?
no , but i am out of options .
bypass isn &apos;t an option . you know that .
do you have a better idea ?
yeah , don &apos;t do something that kills my patient .
dr. grey , this is our patient ,
and you &apos;re having a bad day .
pierce , you are a very smart woman .
there has to be something that we can do ,
apart from bypass ,
that doesn &apos;t involve sending this man home
with your hand in his chest .
so we are all going to be quiet and let you think ,
and you are going to come up with something .
cyanoacrylate .
glue ? you want to use glue to put the patch in ?
what makes you think that &apos;s gonna hold
any better than the stitches did ?
bailey &apos;s infectious optimism .
you heard the woman -- cyanoacrylate .
uh , we don &apos;t have any on hand .
then go get some !
he &apos;s in fib .
what are you waiting for ? go get that glue now !
move ! run !
charge to 25 . clear .
again . clear .
come on , come on , come on .
come on , come on , come on .
come on . come on . come on , come on . ugh .
there he is . we got him back .
he barely has a pressure .
where the hell is that glue ?
it &apos;s coming . any minute now .
any minute .
i have the glue !
optimism for the win .
all right , nurse , i need your finger back in here ,
and i need another patch .
all right .
let &apos;s try this again , shall we ?
on my count .
hands up and see if it holds .
one , two , three .
pressure &apos;s ...
... good .
well ...
huh , that was fun .
okay , great . now tell me your name again .
kate shaw .
good . squeeze my finger .
what city are we in ?
seattle , washington .
very good , other hand .
now , tell me who &apos;s the current u.s. president .
unless it &apos;s changed in the last hour ,
it is still barack obama .
nice . now , tell me about when you got on the plane .
i &apos;m sorry .
no !
no . sorry .
you ...
you have to , okay ?
remember -- sam .
remember ? you thought he was really cute .
i know , you keep saying that .
and you really liked him ,
and he really , really liked you .
why do you keep --
because i think you &apos;re meant to be together , okay ?
i don &apos;t -- - if you &apos;re not ,
then what &apos;s the point of a plane crashing
and bringing the two of you here ?
it &apos;s just -- - stop it !
i don &apos;t know , okay ? i don &apos;t know !
you keep telling me all of these things
that i &apos;m supposed to know , and i don &apos;t know !
you &apos;re not helping !
this isn &apos;t helping .
dr. edwards
edwards !
what the hell were you trying to do in there ?
you do not push a patient like that .
i just -- i hoped that i could --
what , that you could badger her into remembering ?
that is not how this works .
she was distressed enough already ,
and you are only making it worse .
dr. shepherd , you can stop yelling
at my resident in the hallway .
your resident ? your resident ?
yes , yes , today she &apos;s my resident .
okay , i can yell at any resident i want to ,
especially if she has been tormenting my patient .
it looks completely unprofessional .
you really want to argue about this ?
listen -- i do , actually , because you have been
totally unreasonable at every level .
and you are completely out of line .
listen ! okay ?
this story ? it &apos;s all about me .
when i tell it , it &apos;s about me .
it &apos;s not about you or you
or the fact that you two are messed up
&apos;cause you can &apos;t figure out how to date or hook up
or whatever it is that you &apos;re doing
that i just don &apos;t care about .
me . i am the protagonist .
you don &apos;t interest me .
this story is about love and i will find it ,
that he is out there , and that even if i crash a plane ,
he is out there .
and it doesn &apos;t work unless she remembers ,
and you &apos;re ruining it for me .
i am the hero .
kate is the patient that i saved ,
and you two -- you two are messing it up .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m gonna --
i should --
hey , oh , please don &apos;t tell me
you &apos;ve birthed another one of my babies .
oh , no , no .
all the yoga ladies are in repose .
their word , not mine .
it &apos;s about time .
is this the abruption ?
where do you want me ?
outside .
oh , come on , let me help .
i don &apos;t need your help .
i need you to stop hovering .
i &apos;m not hovering .
yes , you are .
you &apos;re hovering and lurking and creeping .
look , i &apos;m just trying to help you .
no , alex , you &apos;re not .
meredith asked you to watch out for me
because she thinks i &apos;m coming apart ,
but i am not coming apart .
but you hovering doesn &apos;t make it any easier .
what would make it easier
is if you got out of my o.r. and let me do my job !
i &apos;ll do a t.e.e. on sam later
to make sure that the repair holds .
any word ?
no .
5 : 00 .
what &apos;s at 5 : 00 ?
derek missed his meeting in d.c. this morning .
i called him , and he didn &apos;t pick up ,
and i haven &apos;t heard from him all day .
5 : 00 is my deadline .
if there &apos;s no news , then i &apos;m gonna go home and freak out .
you &apos;re freaking out now , though , aren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
going over everything you can think of .
you &apos;re going back to the last conversation you had
and playing it over and over in your head
from beginning to end , right ?
yeah .
yeah .
that &apos;s what i would do , too .
you should go home , mer .
zola wants a car . did she tell you ?
a car ?
yeah .
i asked her , &quot; i &apos;m gonna bring something back from d.c. ,
what would you like ? &quot;
and she goes , &quot; i would like to have a car . &quot;
i thought we were at least 10 years away from that .
oh , it &apos;s gonna be here before you know it .
you know , remember ages ago ,
you and i had a really big fight ?
and i told you , i said ,
&quot; you &apos;re like coming up for fresh air .
like i was drowning , and you saved me . &quot;
i still feel that way
when i see you , what we have , our family .
that &apos;s the feeling . it &apos;s you .
it &apos;s always been you .
and i want more .
of this , of us , of --
i want to have more .
let &apos;s have more .
i mean it .
you &apos;re crazy .
that &apos;s not a no .
another baby ?
sure .
uh , seriously ?
i &apos;m completely serious .
like right now , you want to --
oh , no , you are serious .
and now i see it , like 20 yards out ,
nothing but fear and panic on the pilot &apos;s face .
you could see into the cockpit ?
we locked eyes , and then at the last second ,
i dove into the passenger seat .
i could feel the plane .
dr. webber ? can i grab you for a second ?
uh , excuse me .
so , i &apos;ve heard you tell this story
six different ways today ,
and each time , the plane seems to be getting closer .
i &apos;m pretty sure , the next time it &apos;ll end with ,
&quot; and then i died . &quot;
i @-@ i think you &apos;re missing the point here .
i guarantee i am .
maybe i didn &apos;t exactly die back there ,
but i @-@ i sure as hell could have .
i did look up from my car today .
i did see a plane coming toward me .
and for a split second , i did find myself thinking ,
&quot; maybe this is it .
this is where it all ends on 37th street .
between a yarn shop and a falafel stand . &quot;
i know what a near @-@ death experience is ,
and this wasn &apos;t my first .
and it &apos;s true .
your life flashes right before your eyes .
and this morning , mine did .
and suddenly , i saw how much i had .
catherine .
this hospital , all of the people i &apos;ve affected ,
all the people who &apos;ve affected me .
and let me tell you .
it scared the hell out of me .
because the minute you see all the things you have ,
you see all the things that you stand to lose .
look , maybe i did embellish the story some .
i mean , that &apos;s human nature , i guess .
but right now , i &apos;m taking stock of what i have ,
and i &apos;m feeling pretty grateful .
alex , hey .
i &apos;m sorry that i snapped at you .
i know that you were trying to make me feel better , but --
i was making me feel better .
it &apos;s just -- i wanted you to be okay , all right ?
i &apos;m sick of feeling bad .
why ? why would you feel bad ?
do you know it was me who cut off your leg ?
callie was stuck in surgery ,
and your circulation collapsed from sepsis ,
and she decided you had to lose it .
but i made the cut . i &apos;m the one who did it .
just -- i don &apos;t know if you knew that or wanted to ,
but it &apos;s true .
are you pissed ?
i mean , you can be pissed . i get it .
thanks .
for telling me .
you &apos;re sure it &apos;s okay that we &apos;re up here ?
oh , yeah , totally sure .
uh , but maybe keep your voice down .
people are sleeping . that &apos;s all .
okay .
all right . here we are .
this is him ?
this is sam .
you don &apos;t recognize him at all ?
i ...
i don &apos;t know .
dr. edwards .
you know what ? take your time . i &apos;m gonna be right back .
you are just trying to get fired , aren &apos;t you ?
dr. shepherd , i &apos;m sorry .
i told you to take it easy . this is not taking it easy .
she just had surgery . she should not be out of bed .
i know . i thought that if she saw --
no , i disagree .
these are not the actions of someone who thinks .
this is someone ...
oh , my god .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know i &apos;m supposed to keep it down , but --
we had sandwiches .
wait -- you did ?
we did .
he made them .
i don &apos;t like to eat on dates .
i never have an appetite . i &apos;m ... too nervous .
but he made them , and -- and so i took one ,
and i ate it because i wasn &apos;t nervous at all .
not with him .
we had -- we had sandwiches on his plane on our date .
on our -- our first date .
this -- this is sam , right ?
and i &apos;m -- i &apos;m actually remembering this ?
this isn &apos;t -- i &apos;m not just remembering what you told me ?
no , the sandwich story is news to us .
i want to see his eyes .
you said they were beautiful . i don &apos;t remember .
i wish he &apos;d open them .
he will .
so , am i still fired ?
not today . not for this .
but who knows what you &apos;ll pull tomorrow .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
hmm ?
about alex and my leg .
freaking karev .
don &apos;t be mad at him .
he &apos;s an idiot .
i was trying to protect him , but why did he have to --
all this time , you let me hold it against you .
i -- why ?
i made the call .
i mean , no matter what ,
it was still me making the call to take your leg ,
and i knew that you were going to hate me .
i didn &apos;t want you to hate alex , too .
i wanted you to have somebody .
thank you .
chief !
tell kepner i &apos;ll be down soon to help triage the stragglers .
i thought you &apos;d like to know kate &apos;s memory is coming back .
it &apos;s still incomplete , but i &apos;m expecting a full recovery .
thank you . i &apos;m glad to hear it .
you say i &apos;m playing games ?
i am here , ready to talk ,
but you are pissed at me , so i &apos;m getting punished .
i &apos;m not punishing anyone , and i &apos;m not doing this .
i want to .
i want to do this because this is unfair !
this is --
amelia , back off .
you wanted professional .
i &apos;m giving you professional .
no , you &apos;re not . you are hardly being civil .
i am sorry if i hurt your feelings .
i am , but --
this is not about you !
everything isn &apos;t about you !
then what is it ? !
there was a plane crash .
yes .
not the one today .
i &apos;m talking about the plane that had meredith and derek
and arizona and mark and lexie and -
and cristina .
i put them on that plane .
i @-@ i signed the requisition for the airline .
i paid for it . i was in charge .
i don &apos;t care how long i &apos;ve been out of the service .
it was my watch , and they were my men .
and ...
i failed them .
it was my fault .
so , when something like this happens today ,
it brings it all back up .
there was a plane crash .
owen .
and i won &apos;t survive another plane crash , amelia .
and that &apos;s all we are .
why do bad things happen to good people ?
we ask that question so often ,
it becomes a cliche .
but that &apos;s because bad things do happen to good people .
constantly .
you just have to hope that when it &apos;s your turn ,
you &apos;ll know what to do ...
... how to cope ...
how to persevere .
help you with something , edwards ?
no , sir .
what are you doing ?
i am enjoying the view , sir .
me too , edwards .
me too .
but the truth is ...
... you don &apos;t know how you &apos;ll react
to your worst @-@ case scenario .
none of us do ...
... not until it happens .
