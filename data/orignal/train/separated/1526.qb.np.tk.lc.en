here she is !
thanks for being there , you guys .
we wouldn &apos;t have missed it , sweetie .
your speech was fantastic .
what &apos;s wrong with your speech ?
oh , is it that obvious ? i ...
i got adult braces !
are you sure ?
&apos;cause they don &apos;t seem like they fit right .
i think it &apos;s a bold step ,
and i support you in your journey of self @-@ improvement .
no , you &apos;re not getting your hair straightened .
you know your dad wishes he could be here .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m right here !
i had andy set me up
so i could be here with you all .
i just had to plug him in .
it was a nice reversal from when i had to pull the plug
on my dad in the hospital .
while he was away on a business trip ,
phil got a terrible ear infection ,
and the doctors said he
could burst an eardrum if he flew .
i was devastated to miss alex &apos;s graduation ,
until i realized i didn &apos;t have to .
i got to hold up my phone for two hours
so phil could see the graduation live .
bet i was the only dad there not wearing pants .
how great is this thing , huh ?
it &apos;s so convenient .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m right there in the room ... with you guys .
hello ?
hello ?
gloria , would you tell your cousin
to stop leaving his trash everywhere ?
it &apos;s been five days of this nonsense .
he comes in here , eats all my food ,
drinks all my booze ,
and never so much as does a dish .
oh , yes , so different
from what all those white people over there are doing .
you got a blind spot for the deadbeat
yahoos in your family .
he &apos;s not a yahoo , and don &apos;t say that in front of him !
he doesn &apos;t speak english !
he understands it .
oh , really ?
fire ! run ! fire !
you &apos;re being ridiculous , beth . don &apos;t go .
oh , you &apos;re so sweet , but i don &apos;t want to intrude ,
so i &apos;ll just see you guys later .
oh , gloria , tell her she can stay .
of course you can stay .
we love having you here , especially joe .
you &apos;re his new favorite .
i used to be his favorite
until i told him i get paid to hang with him .
i just felt like he had a right to know .
if i &apos;m being honest , i thought i was into andy .
then his girlfriend , beth , came into town ,
and she &apos;s really sweet and they &apos;re great together .
so , in the spirit of graduation ,
i &apos;m officially moving on .
and , unlike my actually graduation ,
there &apos;s no pregnancy scare .
all right .
good .
uh , are you sure about that outfit ?
why does this keep happening ?
well , it &apos;s not because joe dresses like an adult .
i dress like an adult .
you wore light @-@ up sneakers to a radiohead concert .
yes . and did we ever get separated ?
not for lack of trying .
oh , my god .
haley , the number of times i &apos;ve thrown those shoes away .
they &apos;re just too easy to spot in the trash .
oh , yes . yuk it up .
i &apos;m gonna go get him a new shirt .
&quot; goldilocks . &quot;
my mom read this to me a thousand times .
i just never understood
how that little girl got away with it .
what do you mean ?
well , if i were a bear
and somebody broke into my house ,
laid in my bed , and ate my food ,
i &apos;d rip her skinny little arms off .
well , it &apos;s just porridge , right ?
it &apos;s my porridge .
there he is .
this is crazy , but i have this same shirt .
you &apos;re so adorable .
isn &apos;t he adorable ?
y @-@ yeah .
i should leave the room more often .
no !
can you blend cheese ?
i don &apos;t think so , and i don &apos;t want to try it .
i just want a smoothie or something .
hey , guys !
oh , my gosh .
oh , god .
guess what . they accepted your offer .
oh , my gosh ! that &apos;s fantastic !
what offer ?
we &apos;re buying the apartment upstairs from us .
we &apos;re gonna expand ,
put in a proper guest room ,
a home office .
yeah .
so much space .
yeah .
congrats !
i &apos;m gonna roll away before you spit on my screen again .
isn &apos;t that great ?
yeah . oh , so great , so great .
i thought mitchell would be more excited
about the unit upstairs .
something is going on with him .
he &apos;s been more distant lately .
for the last two weeks ,
he hasn &apos;t been that interested in the unit downstairs , either .
what &apos;s that ?
phil , nothing .
it &apos;s just a little gift i got alex .
but we already gave her our present .
that 16 @-@ piece luggage set was a real winner .
this is more of a mother @-@ daughter thing .
it &apos;s just a key chain with a picture of me and alex
on her first day of school .
i wanted her to have something
that reminded her of how much i love her .
why don &apos;t we just sing that song i wrote her ?
because i don &apos;t want to sing that lame song .
lame . okay .
phil , really ? come on .
only you could hurt a robot !
you , uh -- you need some help ?
sure .
so , um , i was wondering --
um , has beth said anything to you about me , about ...
not liking me ?
are you kidding ?
beth &apos;s obsessed with you .
she &apos;s always like ,
&quot; haley &apos;s so cute . i just want to bite her face . &quot;
oh , my god .
she asked me where you work ,
where you go at night , whether you hike alone .
she &apos;s actually very concerned about you .
or is it possible --
what are you guys talking about ?
how i &apos;m only into korean dudes .
oh , hey , honey .
hey , phil .
hey , don &apos;t turn . be cool , be cool .
i need you to make this apartment thing go away .
what ?
i said , &quot; be cool . &quot;
why do you want it to go away ?
we had some budget cuts at the office ,
and a bunch of us got laid off .
now -- now , i didn &apos;t tell cam because ...
i was embarrassed , but also because i knew --
i knew i would get another job like that .
it &apos;s been a month , and -- and now it &apos;s just weird
that i didn &apos;t tell him in the first place ,
so every morning , i leave for work .
well , heigh @-@ ho , heigh @-@ ho . it &apos;s off to work i go .
i send out my resume .
and then , like most unemployed people
hiding the truth from their spouses ,
i go to the park .
and then , one day , i met spencer .
hello .
and now i play checkers with spencer .
no !
and his best friend , george ,
who helped me get over my lifelong fear of birds .
that tickles . stop it ! stop it !
mitchell , you can talk to me .
i &apos;m a realtor .
i need you to kill the deal , okay ?
don &apos;t tell cam .
mitch ...
what was that about ? what did mitchell say ?
do i smell jay &apos;s famous ribs ?
phil . phil .
calm down . gloria needs napkin rings .
i &apos;m gonna hold you up . you can check the high shelves .
lift with your legs . i had a big lunch .
i don &apos;t see any napkin rings .
i just see a box with some spanish written on it .
oh , that &apos;s probably it .
crockett and tubbs ! that &apos;s heroin !
what ? !
you know , horse , smack , hell dust .
i know the nicknames . i &apos;ve watched &quot; kojak . &quot;
i guarantee that low @-@ life cousin of gloria &apos;s
stashed this up there .
jay , where are the napkin rings ?
i &apos;ll give you guys some privacy .
look what your cousin &apos;s hiding in here .
that &apos;s my horse .
that &apos;s yours ?
yes , i brought it back from colombia .
my god . i married into a drug cartel ?
these are the ashes of my dead horse , gaucho .
i had him when i was a little girl .
you thought that these were drugs
and that they belong to my cousin ?
well , what was i supposed to think ?
i am sick of this , jay .
you treat my family like they &apos;re criminals .
like he would bring $ 150,000 worth of
heroin into this house !
how do you know how much --
what ? ! i can &apos;t know street value ? !
alex , honey , could i borrow you for a minute ?
one sec .
uncle mitch , this is amazing .
i can &apos;t believe you kept all of this .
oh , it &apos;s nothing special .
it &apos;s just a handmade scrapbook
of every note and drawing you ever made me .
you got to be kidding me .
oh , oh . hola .
this is good .
this is a report card
that you made for me when you were 4,
and you gave me a b @-@ minus as an uncle .
i was mad because you wasted your vote on ralph nader .
but today , you get an a @-@ plus ,
because this is the most thoughtful gift ever .
oh , mitchell , where do you even find the time for this ?
so , this one -- here or here ?
i don &apos;t know .
what about here ?
spencer !
hey , guys , so , a random question ,
but , um , do any of you
get kind of a weird vibe from beth ?
you know , like maybe something &apos;s a little off ?
beth ? no . she &apos;s an angel .
yeah , she seems super @-@ sweet .
you &apos;re really not shying away from those &quot; s &quot; words , are you ?
s @-@ so , no one thinks
that beth has maybe , like , a slightly psychotic side ?
i see what &apos;s going on here .
somebody &apos;s jealous
&apos;cause she &apos;s not the only pretty girl
around here anymore , hmm ?
thanks , mom .
beth &apos;s super @-@ hot .
if everyone in the coast guard looks like that ,
sign me up .
it &apos;s just on the weekends , right ?
forget it . you &apos;re all useless .
who was that ?
oh , it &apos;s just work .
there is a line that i will not cross .
as soon as i touch that phone , i &apos;m a suspicious spouse ,
and that is not me .
so , i say to the waitress ...
&quot; i saw you pour from the regular pot . &quot;
and , um , she &apos;s like , &quot; nope .
i , uh , poured from the decaf pot . &quot;
you know ? oh , my gosh .
let me get that .
come on . don &apos;t leave me hanging .
were you up all night ?
&quot; had fun with you . spencer .
see you , monday . spencer .
smiley face . spencer . &quot;
who is spencer ? !
hey , mr. d.
can we talk ?
sure thing . what &apos;ll you have ?
what &apos;s up ?
so , i &apos;ve been ...
getting some signals from beth
that she wants me to propose .
that &apos;s exciting .
yeah . i even have ring .
so , what &apos;s the hold @-@ up ?
well ... there &apos;s this other girl ,
and i feel like i have a serious connection with her ,
but ... i just don &apos;t know how she feels .
andy , back when i was dating claire ,
i used to think , &quot; what if i &apos;m in the laundromat one day ,
and robin givens walks in ? &quot;
she asks me for a quarter .
i hand her one .
our fingers linger .
she wonders if maybe after &quot; iron mike , &quot;
what she &apos;s really yearning for
is the touch of a gentler man .
i &apos;m not following .
it &apos;s natural to wonder about a different path ,
but if you truly love beth , you should propose .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;ll do it .
there &apos;s this place she loves by the ocean .
i &apos;ll take her there and propose at sunset .
great !
thank you so much .
bring it in .
oh , come on . get a roomba .
honey , the key chain was a bust .
i need something else . quick . come on .
got it . you want to sing the song .
good thing i brought my ukulele on the trip .
trip !
when alex was little , i took her for brunch
at that cute little dutch town up north .
i @-@ i could take her there again .
a trip for just the two of us . it &apos;s perfect .
* when you don &apos;t -- *
claire ?
alex , honey , do you remember --
oh , my god , mom !
grandpa got me a trip to europe for my graduation !
i just wanted her to know how much she meant to me .
i hate this family .
phil , i need to talk to you , man @-@ to @-@ man .
i think mitchell &apos;s having an affair .
what ?
i was going through his wallet
and i found a receipt to the avian hotel .
it &apos;s probably some fancy french place
where he &apos;s meeting his lover
for their secret weekly rendezvous .
has he said anything to you about the unit upstairs ?
you gasped .
only because you did .
phil , tell me what you know right now .
i don &apos;t know anything . put me down .
talk to your husband .
this is my wallet . you never saw me .
stella , no . bad girl .
bad girl . stella , no .
stella , no .
lily spilled some juice on the counter .
should i frisk her for guns ?
oh , geez .
oh , sorry .
jay , no !
haley !
come check it out .
i was just showing luke and manny
some things that i learned in coast guard training .
you look so pretty .
all right , manny , take this pen from me .
so , you just want me to grab it ?
see ?
that &apos;s what you do
when someone tries to take something that &apos;s yours .
awesome .
my turn .
what happened ? did i get the pen ?
hey , your hair &apos;s burning !
what ? !
oh my god !
ay ! your hair !
i got it !
it &apos;s out ! it &apos;s out !
what happened ?
it must have been that candle .
why &apos;d you sit so close to it ?
she told me to !
ay , beth , thank god that you were here .
i &apos;m just glad i could help .
it &apos;s getting crazy in here .
you want to cool things off in the pool ?
jay !
oh , thank god .
there you are .
okay , you are -- you &apos;re never ...
you &apos;re never gonna believe what my dad did .
lock you in the bathroom ?
no .
he gave alex a trip to europe for her graduation present .
there &apos;s no way i can now give her
a weekend of dutch pancake balls after that .
can you open the door ? i &apos;m feeling claustrophobic .
phil , you &apos;re in a hotel room in seattle .
i &apos;m desperate . just teach me the song .
well , well , well . look who came crawling back .
just teach it to me .
okay .
it &apos;s called &quot; go ask alex . &quot;
* when you don &apos;t know what a word means *
* go ask alex *
* if you need someone to hem your jeans *
* go ask alex *
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m even saying this ,
but instead of &quot; hem your jeans , &quot;
could it be &quot; steam your greens &quot; ?
no , it can &apos;t .
the jeans come back at the 4 @-@ minute mark .
haley .
how you feeling ?
heard about the hair fire . sounds scary .
poor thing .
i left you a gift on your car to help you feel better .
it &apos;s the red one , right ?
hey , can you do me a favor and go start my car ?
uh , i guess .
thanks .
he &apos;s alive . it &apos;s fine .
okay , everybody gather &apos; round .
phil and i have prepared something very special
for our brilliant graduate , alex .
okay , you ready ?
* when you ... *
why is that not -- okay , there &apos;s no sound .
phil , honey ? there &apos;s no sound .
okay , so , while claire fixes robot phil ,
i make toast .
when i first came into this family ,
i didn &apos;t think i was ever going to be accepted .
then , one day ,
alex needed to write a report about a family member ,
and she picked me .
that was the first time i really felt part of the family .
ay , alex , you were the first one to reach out to me ,
and i will never forget that .
they all call you the smart one ,
but to me , you &apos;re the kind one .
i &apos;m so lucky to have you in my life , baby .
gloria .
hear , hear .
oh , there you are .
* when you don &apos;t know what a word -- *
no , not doing it , not doing it . we &apos;re not -- not doing it .
one second .
gloria , watching you give that toast ,
i see you treat my family like your own .
and you &apos;re right .
i need to treat your cousin nicer .
thank you , jay .
do me a favor , huh ? would you translate for me ?
tell armando i &apos;m sorry i haven &apos;t been more welcoming to him .
tell him he &apos;s a great guy .
and he can stay as long as he wants .
we forgive you .
you sure ? maybe i can give him a little hug or something .
no , it &apos;s too much .
bye @-@ bye .
okay , i &apos;ve had enough . i need to know .
who is this precious spencer ?
oh , god . how do you know about spencer ?
so you admit it .
you are having an affair .
what ?
it &apos;s the braces , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ve driven you to stray . i &apos;m hideous .
cam , you &apos;re acting crazy .
am i ? mitchell ...
i found the receipt to the avian hotel .
that &apos;s pronounced &quot; ay @-@ vee @-@ ann . &quot;
well , it sounds seedy .
it is . it &apos;s a kennel for birds .
it &apos;s where i picked up george .
there &apos;s a george , too ?
calm down . i &apos;m talking about a cockatoo .
one or two . is that all ? how blasé ?
cam , george is a bird ,
and spencer is an old man i &apos;ve been hanging out with at the park ,
because i ...
i got laid off .
you lost your job ?
i &apos;m sorry . i just --
i couldn &apos;t tell you that i was out of work again .
i ... i feel like such a loser .
no , please . my gosh .
as long as you &apos;re not cheating on me ,
that &apos;s all that matters .
something will come up . you &apos;re a great lawyer .
oh , thank you . i just --
i don &apos;t think that we can get that apartment right now .
of course we can .
we already have the down payment .
and you know what ? we could get renters .
we could it into an airbnb .
really ? different people every week ?
how exciting and new . it &apos;d be like &quot; the love boat . &quot;
hey , mom , have a second ?
already am .
i wanted to give you a present .
me ? no .
honey , i want to give you a present .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been trying to do all day .
you are the last person who should give me anything .
you got me here .
you got me to graduation , to caltech .
you did it .
and you &apos;re done .
thank you , sweetie . thank you . i love you .
i want you to go to europe with me .
what ? !
yeah . we &apos;ll have a great time .
cafés , museums ,
plus , europe is not safe for teenage girls .
you &apos;ve seen &quot; taken &quot; ?
could you imagine dad getting that phone call ?
what is his particular set of skills ?
juggling ?
hey , dad , can we talk ?
sure , honey .
in private .
oh , not so hard . i can &apos;t breathe .
little robot humor .
i noticed you didn &apos;t laugh at my robot joke .
what &apos;s going on ?
everyone thinks beth is so great ,
but i think she &apos;s crazy .
she &apos;s been after me all day .
why would she be after you ?
she thinks i &apos;m in love with andy .
are you ?
no . i mean , i care about him .
he makes me laugh . i like spending time with him .
well , do you think about him when he &apos;s not around ?
i guess .
sometimes , i see something funny and i think ,
&quot; oh , andy would love that .
i wish he were here
so i could share it with him . &quot;
but ...
honey , i know i &apos;m just a robot ,
but that sounds like love to me .
desn &apos;t matter anyway .
he &apos;s in love with someone else .
maybe i &apos;m the crazy one .
don &apos;t mean to interrupt .
just came to say goodbye .
beth and i are going to take a drive ,
try to catch the sunset .
okay , well , have fun .
okay .
it &apos;s haley . haley &apos;s the girl .
you love ha--
love each other !
come on . i &apos;ll walk you out .
