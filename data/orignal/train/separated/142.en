We're headed to court now.
Dad is taking the plea agreement.
The donors!
Grace.
I want them to hear it from the governor himself.
There's going to be a two week delay.
Wait, this is the right thing to do.
Two years.
That's the lowest we could get.
No, it was before the verdict came in. Why?
Hold on.
Diane thinks we'd better get on with the AUSA,
make sure he's still holding to the plea deal.
Why?
Wait. G-Grace, hold on.
Has she heard something?
No, but she worries about the verdict coming in so fast.
That's usually pro-prosecution.
Grace, I'm going to have to call you back.
I knew he'd find some way to screw us.
We agreed,
Peter would take a two years plea.
That's a sitting governor,
agreeing to a two year prison sentence.
The jury was out one hour.
You and I both know that means a guilty verdict.
No. We don't know anything.
We know I'm not the one running scared to you.
I want four years.
No.
My client would rather roll the dice.
Your client is risking ten years in prison with a guilty verdict.
Ten years...
away from his kids,
away from you.
Why don't you ask the Blagojevich family
因倒卖伊利诺伊州参议员职位被判处十四年刑期
how well they're holding up?
You think you can play the emotional card with me?
You think I'm going to break down and cry?
Look at me.
Do I look like I'm breaking down?
Three years.
No.
But here's what we'll give you.
An immediate surrender.
Today. Within the hour.
Peter surrenders in court.
No press conference.
No talk about how you smeared his family.
You get the press cycle all to yourself,
and that's the best I'll offer.
But, Dad, you have to fight this.
I can't risk being away from you until you're 30.
It's two years.
I'm going to be at your graduation, in the front row.
I promise.
I can't go to college now.
Grace. You will go.
You have to make us proud.
You have to make your mom forget this.
Okay?
Okay.
Now I got to go comfort Eli.
Thank you.
What for?
I didn't do anything.
You stuck by me through the presidential.
I made a mistake there with you,
and I'm sorry for that.
All rise. The Honorable Judge
Richard Cuesta presiding.
So I understand we have a plea deal.
We do, Your Honor.
Governor Florrick, you are accused of bribery,
obstruction of justice,
and wire fraud, in the matter of the murder trial
of Patty Tanniston.
Now, in accepting this plea,
you acknowledge willfully arranging the mistrial
of her accused murderer, Richard Locke,
in exchange for the political contributions of his father.
And, uh, you... um...
Your Honor?
Before turning to your plea, there is another matter.
The jury has not yet reached a verdict.
But they do have a question.
What does that mean?
Your Honor, the jury's question
is no longer relevant given our plea arrangement.
Actually, the plea has not been entered yet.
Well, we were in the midst of entering it, so...
Yes, but it appears that the
defendant is rejecting the plea deal. Is that correct?
It is, Your Honor.
Okay.
Well, then let's listen to the question that the jury has.
I mean, I'm excited about this.
Thank you.
From the jury: "We have read
the transcripts of the victim's 911 call,
but we would like to hear the call itself."
Is that possible?
Your Honor, sidebar, please?
Let's go.
Why is that good?
Because they're focusing on the murder
and not Dad's guilt.
And we want that?
'Cause we want... want to distract them?
But that doesn't mean Dad is guilty.
I know. You don't have to sugarcoat it.
I need your help.
Look, stop playing coy and get in here and help.
I thought the verdict was coming down.
No, the jury has a question.
This is not over.
911. Where's the emergency?
Hi, yeah, I think somebody's trying to break in.
Where are you, ma'am?
865 Heylan Avenue.
There are some noises outside my window.
Heylan Avenue. And what are you hearing, ma'am?
I think somebody's trying to get in.
I heard the locks being turned.
My boyfriend was supposed to be back, but he called...
Are you someplace safe, ma'am?
Have you set all your locks?
Yes, but just... There it is again.
Are you there, ma'am?
Someone's trying to get in. Wait, one second.
Ma'am.
Are you there, ma'am? Ma'am?
Yeah, I just...
I'm here. Hold on.
Are you sending someone?
Yes, ma'am. Just stay on the phone.
Wait! No! No!
And there you have it.
The 911 call.
Tad, if you would escort them back to the jury room, please.
Uh, excuse me, is there something else?
Yes. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
We do have one more question.
Yes.
At the 48 second mark,
in the transcript, there's a sound listed as "Inaudible noise."
What is it?
Your Honor.
Sidebar, Your Honor.
Ma'am?
Yeah, I just...
Ma'am?
Yeah, I just...
Ma'am?
Yeah, I just...
Is that the sound at 48 seconds?
Ma'am?
Yeah, I just...
What is it?
How are you going to find out?
What are you doing?
What's that?
It's a ringtone.
It's a freaking ringtone.
Someone else's.
How do you know?
She was using her cell to call 911.
Your Honor, they want to re-open this case.
It was argued. We had closing arguments.
We are merely trying to satisfy the jury's questions.
No, you're not, Diane. Don't play innocent.
You're trying to shout down the other evidence
with this melodrama.
Exactly.
We're not the ones asking the question, Your Honor.
The jury is. They obviously have some probative value.
Well, first of all, do we even know what this
"Inaudible noise" was?
We do.
Okay. Then this is what I want.
Bring me legal arguments tomorrow morning
as to whether the jury should hear this evidence,
and the jury will delay their deliberations until then.
No.
It's a ringtone.
How did you find that out?
I didn't. Jason did.
I thought Jason wasn't working on this.
He wasn't. I asked him to.
He thinks we could imply someone else was there.
Well, it will keep the jury occupied.
They seem to want to chase the murder.
Question is, will Cuesta let it in.
Diane, my second year...
we argued something similar to this... A bribery case?
Do you have the research? I could probably find it.
It was 2010. Something with Sweeney.
Do we have it online?
The briefs, not the notes.
You may want to check the file cabinets.
Looks like an all-nighter digging up precedents,
so let's get started.
You should probably thank Jason.
I will.
You should probably thank him now.
I will, Lucca.
What's going on?
Jason thinks that if Peter goes to prison,
you'll never divorce him.
What?
Jason just thinks...
No, I heard what you said, I...
What does that even mean?
It means,
you don't want to kick a man when he's down.
Okay, and by man, are we meaning Jason?
No. Peter.
You tend to confuse responsibility and love.
I...
Is Jason saying all this?
Some of it. I added a few bits.
Just think about it.
Who do you want to come home to?
Every night.
Who do you want to see when you open your door?
Lucca, it's not up to me.
Jason wants his freedom.
Talk to him.
What will that do?
Talk to him.
My God.
Stupid.
不得靠近 楼梯危险
I can't read that.
What's that say?
It says U.S. V. Nunez.
Oh. Of course. U.S. V Nunez. How could I forget?
It's the St. Jude of precedents.
Lost causes.
You've had your closing argument,
the judge instructs the jury,
you think it's over, right?
But it's not.
Nothing's ever over. Remember that.
Nothing.
A case may be reopened when the party so moving
provides a reasonable explanation for failure
to present the evidence in its case-in... chief.
You remembered all that?
Hey, I was
the one awake in criminal procedure.
I was awake.
No, you were not.
You were always... drunk,
lolling around.
That is so not true.
And I've never lolled in my life.
Okay. Tell me the name of our professor.
Oh, come on, you don't remember his name.
I do. Professor Stone.
What?
Nothing.
It's just really good to see you again.
Again?
Where was I?
You wouldn't like it here now.
Things have gotten sad.
Hmm, things were pretty sad when I was here.
No. They were never sad.
Us hating each other?
Did you really hate me?
Oh, yeah.
So what do I do?
I told you.
U.S. V. Nunez.
No.
In life.
Oh, that.
I don't know. I was never very good at that.
Yes, you were.
You always made it look so easy.
Why didn't I come to you?
What did you say?
"It was romantic because it didn't happen.
So you got a little bit of both."
Life. Us together.
And now romance.
Hey. Do you have a minute?
Sorry. Are you all right?
Yeah. I'm just, uh, studying precedents.
What's up?
I need you to talk with Cary.
Why?
Matan won't help and I need access
to the prosecutor's work.
Cary won't help me.
I'm the last person he'd help.
I disagree.
U.S. V. Nunez. Good.
Smart. And I got David Boies to argue for us.
It'll impress the hell out of Cuesta.
So, where are we on evidence?
We're trying to find the owner of the cell phone.
We need a few more hours.
I only have one witness.
Can you stretch it?
David Boies.
Chairman of the firm, Boies, Schiller & Flexner.
Sir, you are one of the most respected
legal experts working today, is that correct?
I'd rather not say that about myself.
And, uh,
you are here as an expert on U.S. V. Nunez?
I am.
But first, um,
tell us a little about yourself.
Let's start with your childhood.
Your Honor,
uh... relevance?
Oh, I think the relevance...
will become clear.
I'll give you a little leeway.
Where were you born, Mr. Boies?
Things are looking up in court?
A bit.
Knock on wood.
I'm just trying to stay away,
and focus on my core constituents.
Which is why I wanted to meet with you, Dwight.
I'm not here, Peter.
I'm just waiting on my wife who's shopping.
Yes, I know.
But you've given a lot of money to my campaigns over the years,
and I wanted to tell you first...
this isn't over.
I know.
Eli told me.
Good. Because there are a lot of paths to the future.
I know. Alicia.
Excuse me?
Eli said we move our investments to Alicia.
Wha... to...
Wha... what did Eli say?
Alicia divorces you,
she runs for office,
we invest in her.
It's good.
Especially when you look at her approval ratings.
I didn't know he was teaching.
Guest lecturer.
He looks like he's been doing this his whole life.
It's nice when people find their purpose.
Thank you for helping with Peter.
That's what I do.
Lucca thinks...
What does Lucca think?
Lucca thinks we should talk.
About?
Us.
God.
I don't know.
My head hurts every time I try to figure out
what it is you want and what I want
and how those two things may coincide.
No. Look...
your husband needs you.
I think sometimes you need to be needed.
It keeps you from tipping over.
I j...
Wait for me.
Okay?
Just wait.
Talk to Matan.
Matan won't help.
Why did they not do a full search
of the evidence room for the missing bullets?
Peter wouldn't sign off on it.
No. After he left.
What would be the point?
The bullets were gone.
There's a metal detector right outside the evidence room.
I can't be the first person to have noticed that.
The missing bullets... are still in there somewhere.
Why did no one ever look after the mistrial?
What would be the point?
The truth. Cary, you always talk about the truth.
Oh, come on. Your husband caused that mistrial.
That's the truth. Seriously.
So don't pretend like you actually care
about what really happened.
Well, if Peter did it, he did it.
I want to know what happened either way.
A total search of the evidence room is a dead end.
It would take too long.
There's something else.
There was a cell phone ringing on the Patty Tanniston 911 call.
We need your help, Cary.
Who could've been there with Patty?
And that's when you represented George Steinbrenner
in the suit against Major League Baseball?
Yes, that's correct.
Could you expand, uh, upon those thoughts?
Which thoughts?
Uh, well, the thoughts about, you know,
what we were just talking about.
Your Honor.
Seriously?
Is that an objection?
Yes. Relevance.
Excuse me.
Withdrawn.
Mr. Boies, actually, one quick question.
Do you think U.S. v. Nunez applies here?
Yes, I do. I think...
Thank you, sir.
No further questions.
No rebuttal.
I'm not sure what I would rebut anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Boies-- that was an unadulterated pleasure.
That's it?
Yes. Thank you.
Okay.
That was interesting.
Your Honor,
we have a witness here
whose cell phone was heard
on the 911 tape.
Seriously?
Would you like to hear from her, Your Honor?
Yes, I would.
Your Honor, sidebar, please?
I expected nothing less. Let's go.
What happened?
What do you mean?
You're supposed to be on your way to Berkeley.
No, I'm staying.
Grace...
you're going to college.
This isn't open for debate.
No, I already called them.
I'm just delaying for one year.
Oh, my God, Grace, you can't do that.
I'm not going to the west coast
while dad's in trouble. You wouldn't do it--
I'm not gonna do it, either.
This isn't about me.
This is about your future.
Right.
And I get to decide my future.
So you were
in Patty Tanniston's apartment.
That was your cell phone ringing?
Yeah. But I left as soon as it rang.
But there were only seconds
between your cell phone ringing
and the gunshots that killed Patty Tanniston.
Not seconds.
Yes, it was.
Exactly 23 seconds.
Can we hear the 911 tape again?
Your Honor, please, the defense is throwing
every insane theory against the wall to see what sticks.
No. The police and prosecution never pursued this witness,
because they were obsessed with Locke.
But what does that matter?
We are not trying to solve a murder.
This is not Murder on the Orient Express.
Yes, I love mysteries
as much as the next person,
but this is confined.
Did a politician do something corrupt?
Your Honor,
if I may be allowed to con...
No. Hold on.
What did George Orwell say?
"To see what is in front of your nose
needs a constant struggle."
You're right, of course,
AUSA Fox.
We've heard enough here.
The jury will be asked
to continue their deliberations
without this testimony.
Your Honor...
No, I have made my ruling.
Do you see what's going on in court?
Yeah. So?
Do you think we missed something?
No.
You think the bullets are still in the evidence room?
Probably.
Remember how cops talked about pitting evidence?
Why you bringing that up?
I'm not wearing a wire, Matan.
I'm just saying that cops used to talk about pitting evidence.
They'd "accidentally" drop the evidence in a case just closed.
With our bullets, that would narrow down the search
to a few hundred cases, wouldn't it?
One year.
Probation?
No.
One year real jail time.
No.
You know, I met you some years ago.
At the Equal Justice Conference in 2008.
Do you remember?
No.
Your husband was giving a speech.
This was before... everything.
You were fun.
We, uh... we-we talked about our kids.
You, uh... you made a joke
about the terrible twos
and how they weren't as bad as the freakin' fours.
That was a long time ago.
Yeah. Not many laughs now.
Really?
I don't make you laugh now?
The wife of someone you're prosecuting
for corruption doesn't amuse you?
Okay. Thank you.
Hey, here's a thought.
You give my husband one year probation, no jail time,
and I'll work up a demure smile for you.
How's this?
Good-bye, Mrs. Florrick.
Well, just tell them it's over.
I got to go.
It's weird having you across the street here.
Yeah, well, Diane thought it would be a good idea.
Judge Cuesta doesn't like me.
I think it might be working.
It's going well.
What are you doing, Eli?
What am I doing? I'm... making sure you're all right.
Telling my donors to give up on me?
Excuse me?
I talked to Dwight.
He said you've been urging the donors
to move their interest to Alicia.
He looked at me like I was a dead man,
like I didn't exist.
Do not patronize me.
I am still the governor of this state.
Okay, I won't.
This is a smart move.
What is?
Screwing me over?
No, moving political assets over to Alicia.
Even if you retain your office, you are injured.
The donors can't stick with you.
They can't be seen within a mile of you.
Because you're telling them not to.
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
No, it is not, Peter. Now, we don't want their money to go
to Rahm or Stratton or White.
We have to give them someone.
Alicia?
Yes.
If I'm so tainted,
why am I not tainting her?
Because she will divorce you.
And it will be seen as a move of independence.
Does Alicia know?
Not yet.
It's the smart move, Peter.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Hi, Alicia.
What?
That's great news. I'll see you soon.
They found the bullets.
They were discovered by prosecutor, Matan Brody, in another
evidence box, Your Honor. They were accidentally misplaced.
This is so convenient.
It does seem oddly timed. I mean,
five years have gone by and they haven't checked once?
They had no reason to search thoroughly.
This trial changed their mind.
We're having the bullets
tested now, Your Honor.
And you think
the results should be given to the jury?
It supports the defense's contention
that Peter had no reason to hide them.
When is this over, Your Honor? I mean,
at a certain point, the jury has to work
with the information given them.
I don't know. This is a very unusual case.
It is, Your Honor, and we ask that...
We had the bullet test expedited, Your Honor.
These should be the results now.
Where are you? Your office is crazy.
Yes, We have an office space crisis.
Thanks for rushing the results, Kurt. What did you find?
It's definitive.
Good. We'll need you to testify.
I'm not sure you'll want that.
Why?
The bullets came from Locke's gun. He did it.
You're sure?
Yes.
Florrick had reason to hide 'em.
Okay, so we back down on our motion
without seeming to back down.
It doesn't mean that he's guilty.
I don't know
if I care anymore.
He's your client.
That's why you care.
Was that the ballistics?
Uh, no. I, um...
Not yet.
So I imagine
you're still using U.S. v. Nunez as precedent?
I, um...
Your Honor?
‭As to why the bullet testing should be given to the jury.
Yes, Your Honor.
The jury had partial evidence.
Now they will have full evidence.
How are we expecting them to decide
when they're missing the most essential piece of our case?
The bullet evidence.
They jury must have access to the... what?
...best available evidence.
But they have the full evidence now.
The evidence isn't the testing.
The evidence is Governor Florrick's state of mind.
Ms. Lockhart?
Yes?
Your argument.
Well, we stand by our original contention.
Which was?
What we originally said.
All relevant evidence is what we want.
Okay.
Strong argument.
What the hell was that?
The bullets worked against us.
Oh, damn.
I heard about the ballistics test.
Just so you know,
I didn't do it.
It doesn't matter.
The jury's deliberating anyway.
It matters to me.
Should I take the year?
I don't know.
I did eight months and that was hard.
But a whole year.
Grace says she is going to drop out of college
to visit you in prison
What?
I know. We're talking.
Court's back in session.
The original ballistic test on these spent bullets
was a pyrolysis gas chromatography.
And this was the test performed by Kurt McVeigh,
the expert hired by the SA's office?
Yes.
And what test did you perform?
An elemental composition test.
He would've performed it, too,
if the bullets hadn't been lost.
And did you perform this test today?
I did.
And what did you find?
Hey, this is not good.
The bullets definitely came from Richard Locke's gun.
Your Honor,
I would agree with the defense.
I think the jury should have this evidence
to aid in their deliberations.
We have to get Kurt to testify.
No, he won't help us.
If these results get to the jury,
they will find against Peter.
Hello, Ms. Lockhart.
Do we have any questions for this witness?
Not at this time, Your Honor.
We do have one other witness, Your Honor.
We call Kurt McVeigh.
I had nothing to do with him testifying!
He's your husband, do you know what that looks like?
The jury didn't hear it.
But they will hear it.
Cuesta believed him. He believed both of them.
Can we just talk about...
Then we argue about not entering that evidence.
Or we undercut his testimony.
We have nothing to undercut him with.
There's a better way...
He reversed himself!
He reversed his testimony.
No.
He only reversed himself
because I convinced him to testify in the first place.
So? We can still use it.
We can still use the reversed testimony.
No!
Because he's your husband?
No.
Because he's honest.
He can't be undercut.
Diane, you have a client.
My husband.
You have a duty to zealously represent that client.
And I am.
I am, but to besmirch this witness would backfire on us.
I am not saying this because he is my husband,
I am saying this because it is strategically a mistake.
I disagree.
Then have Peter fire me.
I need your help.
With what?
Cross-examination.
Any questions, Ms. Lockhart?
No, Your Honor.
Yes, just a few.
Mr. McVeigh,
this is a change in your attitude,
this new ballistic test.
No, not a change.
A, uh... it's a more refined test.
But you testified during the trial
that your ballistic test leaned toward the bullets
not belonging to Richard Locke's gun.
Yes, I did.
And now you have a different opinion.
Not a different opinion,
a further scientific analysis.
You're retired, aren't you, Mr. McVeigh?
Yes, I retired this month.
And yet you did this ballistic test
just a few hours ago?
Yes, I did. As a favor.
And you checked your findings with the prosecutor's
ballistics expert, Holly Westfall?
I did.
Why did you do that?
I wanted to see if she had the same result.
Is this standard operating procedure?
No.
Why did you do it, then?
This was an unusual case.
And we had a differing opinion in 2012.
And isn't it true that you've given her your business?
I've sold her my business. That's true.
And isn't it true
that you have had an affair with Holly Westfall?
Objection, Your Honor.
For the life of me, I can't figure out the relevance here.
The relevance is that Mr. McVeigh has changed
his testimony to align with the prosecutor's expert.
Bias from an affair is completely relevant.
This is more melodrama, Your Honor.
The defense is having trouble sticking to the facts.
Again, I am a jury of one here.
I will allow some leeway in questioning
then rule on the relevance for the jury.
You may proceed.
Isn't it true, Mr. McVeigh,
that you have had an affair with Holly Westfall?
And isn't that the reason that
you've changed your testimony?
What is the point?
What?
What is the point of all this?
To zealously represent our clients.
Right.
Diane knows it better than anyone.
And the ethics of it?
Hey, ethics change.
We're all adults here.
Things used to be simpler.
No.
Things were never simple.
Well, that was effective.
So the jury doesn't get the new ballistics test.
It was all for naught.
Yup. You have an offer?
One year.
No.
Probation.
One year probation. No jail time.
The governor resigns from his governorship.
We could wait for a verdict.
Yes, you could.
But Peter won't want that.
Why?
He's guilty.
We'll consider it.
Do.
He won't get better.
What do you think?
It's up to you.
But what do you think?
I would take it.
It's amazing we've come this far.
This jury is unpredictable.
You take the plea, you don't spend one day in jail.
My career will be over.
I think it's over anyway, isn't it?
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna take the deal.
But I need one more favor.
I'll announce tomorrow.
Stand by my side.
Sure.
What do I do now?
Go to him.
You're done with Peter.
Like a fever, it's over.
Jason's not you.
Hmm. Very few people are me.
He's a boy.
He likes boy things.
You like boy things.
No, I don't. What makes you say that?
God, you have so little self-awareness.
What if I'm unhappy with him?
Blame me. Seriously,
do you want to live here alone?
Look at this place. It'll drive you crazy.
You're right.
Then go to him. It's not too late.
I'll love you forever.
I'm okay with that.
Hey, where's Jason?
Gone. Why?
Where?
I don't know.
I tried his cell. No luck.
Hey, Jason. Where are you?
I need to talk. I...
It's over.
Peter's taking the plea.
My daughter is going to school,
and I...
I need to see you.
Call me back, please.
通话结束
Good afternoon.
At 3:30 today, I informed the lieutenant governor
that I am resigning the office of governor of Illinois.
Though I have been cleared
of all but one corruption charge,
I wish to spare the people of Illinois
any further expense or frustration.
My wife and I would like to thank all the people
who have supported us over the years.
As you can imagine,
this has been a difficult time.
I do want to thank my legal team.
Diane Lockhart. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I want to thank my children,
and all my friends who have stood by us.
And I especially want to thank my wife, Alicia.
I couldn't have done this without you.
Thank you all very much.
Jason?
Alicia.
Jason.
Diane?
