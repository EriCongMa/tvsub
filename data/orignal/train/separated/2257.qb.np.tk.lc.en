killing me is gonna take a lot more than that , dearie .
hook .
captain hook ?
we destroyed the wardrobe .
no !
we should start searching for a new portal
back to storybrooke .
there &apos;s an enchanted compass . cora seeks it .
it &apos;s not the climb you need to worry about .
it &apos;s the giant at the top .
your longest stint anywhere was two years .
what did you enjoy so much about tallahassee ?
it &apos;s poison .
i love you , henry .
you saved me .
it &apos;s a little freakier than i remember from the story .
reminds me of death .
encouraging .
well , your compass awaits .
shall we ?
wait . if these beans ...
create ...
portals ,
why not just pick one and go home ?
why the compass ?
because there aren &apos;t any more beans .
whatever story you think you know , my dear ,
is most certainly wrong .
there was a guy named jack and a cow
and something about an evil giant with a treasure
and a golden goose .
or harp .
sounds like a lovely tale ,
but the truth &apos;s a little bit more gruesome .
the giants grew the beans ,
but rather than use them for good ,
they used them to plunder all the lands .
jack was a man who fought a terrible war ,
defeating all but one of the evil giants .
the beans were destroyed by the giants as they died .
if they couldn &apos;t have their magic , then nobody could .
it &apos;s really very bad form .
evil giants who made magic portal beans ?
why doesn &apos;t anyone just go up and grow some more ?
because one giant survived--
the strongest and most terrible of them all .
and we &apos;ll have to get past him to--
the magic compass .
indeed .
the treasure remains ,
and amongst it is the compass .
now it will guide us to your land .
cora has the means
to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes ,
but she can &apos;t find your land without the compass .
once we get it ,
steal the ashes from her , and we &apos;re on our way .
how do we know you &apos;re not just using us
to get the compass for cora ?
because you four are far safer company .
all i need is a ride back .
i &apos;ll swear allegiance to whomever gets me there first .
then we &apos;d better start climbing .
right . so ...
i failed to mention that the giant
enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders .
all right , so how do we get up there ?
i &apos;ve got a counter spell from cora ,
if you &apos;d be so kind .
thank you , my lady .
i &apos;ve got one more of these .
cora was to accompany me .
so ...
which one of you four lovelies shall take her place ?
go on . fight it out .
don &apos;t be afraid to , you know , really get into it .
impressive .
but really , you could &apos;ve just asked me for the keys .
just drive . it &apos;s fine .
i just stole your car . your life could be in danger .
neal cassidy .
yeah , i &apos;m not telling you my name .
no , i don &apos;t need it to have you arrested
when the robbery &apos;s in progress .
emma . swan .
good name .
so do you just live in here ,
or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen ?
why don &apos;t i tell you over drinks ?
excuse me ?
hey . eyes on the road .
i am not having drinks with you . you might be a pervert .
i might be a pervert , but you &apos;re definitely a car thief .
i said i was sorry .
you didn &apos;t , actually .
damn it .
that &apos;s why i said , &quot; eyes on the road . &quot;
screwdriver .
license and registration .
terribly sorry , officer , but this is actually my car .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m trying to , uh , teach my girlfriend how to drive stick .
she &apos;s got a lot to learn .
i know .
but , you know ... women .
all right , i hear you .
it &apos;s a warning ... this time .
yeah . thank you so much .
what are you , some sort of a misogynist ?
you &apos;re welcome .
oh , go . we got lucky .
&quot; we &quot; ?
this isn &apos;t your car either , is it ?
i stole a stolen car ?
now how about that drink ?
all due respect , i &apos;m the best @-@ equipped to go .
how many wars have you been through ? my share .
it should be me .
you ? you haven &apos;t fought in a battle .
this is about us getting home to our loved ones .
why would you--
because i have no loved ones .
if i fail , you can still go on .
it &apos;s me . i &apos;m going , and i &apos;m not gonna fail .
you &apos;re new here .
it &apos;s about getting back to henry .
i don &apos;t care what i have to face .
you &apos;re not gonna argue with me ?
would it do any good ?
no .
anything in that bag that &apos;s gonna help me with a giant ?
a hook .
come with me .
this ...
powder made from poppies .
he has to inhale it .
your sword-- how strong is it ?
the most powerful blade in all the realms .
is it strong enough to cut through that beanstalk ?
indeed .
give me ten hours .
if i &apos;m not back , you cut it down and keep going .
snow won &apos;t like that .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m asking you .
if i don &apos;t get back , you get her home .
ladies .
in this world , we are slaves to time .
and ours is running out .
in other words , ticktock .
i was hoping it &apos;d be you .
just get on with it .
put your hand right here .
that &apos;s a good girl .
this will allow you to climb . there are other dangers .
thankfully , you &apos;ve got me to protect you .
i can &apos;t climb one @-@ handed , can i ?
don &apos;t think i &apos;m taking my eyes off you for a second .
i would despair if you did .
let &apos;s go .
first beanstalk ?
well , you never forget your first .
you know ,
most men would take your silence as off @-@ putting ,
but i love a challenge .
i &apos;m concentrating .
no , you &apos;re afraid .
afraid to talk ,
to reveal yourself ,
to trust me .
things &apos;ll be a lot smoother if you do .
you should be used to people not trusting you .
the pirate thing .
well , i don &apos;t need you to share .
you &apos;re something of an open book .
am i ?
quite . let &apos;s see .
you volunteered to come up here
because you were the most motivated .
you need to get back to a child .
that &apos;s not perception . that &apos;s eavesdropping .
ah , but you don &apos;t want to abandon him
the way you were abandoned .
was i ?
like i said ,
an open book .
how would you know that ?
i spent many years in neverland , home of the lost boys .
they all share the same look in their eyes--
the look you get when you &apos;ve been left alone .
yeah , well , my world ain &apos;t neverland .
but an orphan &apos;s an orphan .
love has been all too rare in your life , hasn &apos;t it ?
you ever even been in love ?
no . i have never been in love .
i think this little guy is hungry .
go ahead and get whatever you want , sweetie .
i &apos;m gonna get directions .
i will .
hey , man . how are you ?
i &apos;ve been better .
listen , my wife and i ...
are really lost .
i &apos;m trying to get to eugene ,
and i think we &apos;ve been going the wrong way .
can you show me what &apos;s going on here ?
where are we , first of all ?
okay , wait . do i look like a tour guide ?
why don &apos;t you buy the map ? then i can help you .
okay .
okay . now your problem is ...
is you &apos;re way up here . you see that ?
oh , my god . that is a problem .
yeah .
now what you wanna do ...
you have to take 5 all the way south towards salem .
that &apos;s right down there . you see that ?
okay .
that &apos;s where you &apos;re going . you got it ?
hey , mister , that guy &apos;s stealing that--
oh , god ! oh , god .
honey ?
oh . oh . i think--
i think it &apos;s time .
he &apos;s ready ?
oh , yeah .
you didn &apos;t see him take the--
oh ! oh ! it hurts really bad !
do you guys need help ?
no , no , mister , you didn &apos;t see--
oh , my god !
it hurts really bad !
okay . okay .
you want me to call an ambulance ?
no , it &apos;s fine !
my car &apos;s out front .
i know , i know . breathe , baby .
oh ! oh ! oh , god .
breathe ! let &apos;s go ! come on .
oh ! oh , god !
you know they were stealing .
the little guy saved us .
he sure did !
the miracle of birth !
good haul .
thanks .
i got you a key chain .
do you like it ?
yeah .
okay . we gotta go .
all right , come on , kids .
20 minutes till housekeeping .
you wanna shower first ?
oh , look . the granola family left this .
what is that ?
it &apos;s a native american dream catcher .
it &apos;s supposed to keep all the nightmares out
and only let the good dreams in to protect your home .
it &apos;s flypaper for nightmares ?
let &apos;s keep it .
yeah . hang it where ? the car ?
it &apos;s not much of a home .
maybe it &apos;s time we get a real place .
are you saying--
why not ?
we &apos;ve been on the road long enough .
maybe it &apos;s time we retire the bonnie and clyde act .
so i think-- i think it &apos;s time .
together ?
don &apos;t you wanna ?
like where ? neverland ?
i &apos;m serious . we could do this .
where ?
where ? i &apos;ll tell you where .
close your eyes and point .
whatever spot you pick--
that &apos;s our home .
tallahassee .
we got a winner .
is it near a beach ?
yeah , it &apos;s florida . everything &apos;s near a beach .
okay , then tallahassee it is .
tallahassee it is .
are you sure ? is this ...
what you really want ?
what i really want is you .
what is that ?
keeps the time .
you have somewhere to be ?
we can mark watches , take turns sleeping .
we &apos;ll most likely have to walk through the night again ,
so we should rest while we can .
i &apos;ll take first shift .
i &apos;ll stay up with you .
okay .
when &apos;s the last time you slept ?
i don &apos;t really sleep now .
not after what i &apos;ve been through .
sleeping curse .
the one time i did sleep , i had horrible nightmares .
it &apos;s a side effect .
same thing happened to me .
it did ?
mm . i had them for months .
charming--my husband--
he used to wake me ,
when i cried out , he &apos;d light a candle .
he said it would capture the nightmares .
he &apos;d watch over me as i fell back to sleep .
sounds like he lives up to his name .
yeah .
why don &apos;t you try ... to sleep ?
i &apos;ll watch over you .
you &apos;ll be safe .
thank you .
what happened here ?
it &apos;s where the final battle was .
give me your hand .
what ?
your hand--it &apos;s cut . let me help you .
no . no . it &apos;s fine .
no , it &apos;s not .
so now you &apos;re gonna be a gentleman ?
giants can smell blood ,
and i &apos;m always a gentleman .
what the hell is that ?
it &apos;s rum .
a bloody waste of it .
here &apos;s the plan .
we wait for the giant to fall asleep .
when he does , we &apos;ll sneak past him into his cave .
it &apos;s where the treasures are ,
where the compass lies .
and then ?
and then we run like hell .
i don &apos;t have time to wait for a giant to fall asleep .
the powder mulan gave us-- we need to use it .
we gotta knock him out .
well , that &apos;s riskier .
than waiting for a giant to fall asleep when we need him to ?
point taken .
ooh , you &apos;re a tough lass .
you &apos;d make a hell of a pirate .
who &apos;s milah on the tattoo ?
someone from long ago .
where is she ?
she &apos;s gone .
gold .
rumplestiltskin .
he took more than your hand from you , didn &apos;t he ?
that &apos;s why you want to kill him .
for someone who &apos;s never been in love ,
you &apos;re quite perceptive , aren &apos;t you ?
maybe i was once .
i got doughnuts .
i got jelly .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
no , no . hey .
what &apos;s wrong ?
this was on the wall at the post office .
i didn &apos;t even know they did that still .
when did this happen ?
i was a janitor in phoenix--
this high @-@ end jewelry place .
the manager was a drunk .
he would forget to lock the case to the expensive watches .
neal--
i resisted twice .
the third time , this guy &apos;s asking to get took .
so i @-@ i grabbed a couple cases of watches
and i hopped on a train to portland .
the store &apos;s got insurance .
anyway , i stashed &apos; em in a locker at the train station .
they &apos;re still there .
it &apos;s hardly stealing .
so you got away clean .
i didn &apos;t get away clean .
the manager may have been a drunk ,
but the security cameras are stone sober .
i thought this heat had died down , but it hasn &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry . tallahassee &apos;s out .
i gotta go to canada .
that &apos;s fine .
i like maple syrup .
i gotta go to canada alone .
why ?
if i get caught , and you &apos;re with me ,
you &apos;re in trouble--
you &apos;re not gonna get caught .
how can you say that ? you think crossing the border &apos;s easy ?
we get fake id and passports .
those cost money . we have a stolen car .
we make it legit .
we take a v.i.n. number off of another car .
emma , i &apos;m not gonna have you in the seat next to me
with $ 20,000-- wait . wait . seriously , wait . wait . wait .
what if i go and get the watches out of the locker ?
no one &apos;s looking for me . we can--we can fence them
and then we have the money . we can do whatever we want .
we can go wherever we want , right ?
we could change our identities and go to tallahassee .
so you--you want to steal the watches
to help me with get away with stealing the watches ?
yes .
that is exactly what i want to do .
i can &apos;t let you risk everything--
i love you .
i love you , too .
you think you can do it ?
i know i can .
you ready ?
yeah .
oh , damn it .
you big git !
yeah , you . huh ?
you wanna kill a human ?
huh ? you want to kill a human ?
i &apos;m the worst human around . come on !
come on then !
come on then !
hook ?
hook !
he &apos;s out cold .
i don &apos;t mean to upset you , emma ,
but i think we make quite the team .
let &apos;s go steal a compass .
hey . aurora ?
it was just a dream .
it was just a dream .
it was horrible .
why don &apos;t you tell me about it ? do you want to tell me about it ?
come on . let &apos;s stand . tell me .
it was the same as last time .
i was in this room-- this--this red room .
it was bright . blood @-@ red curtains .
there was no windows or doors so it didn &apos;t make sense ,
and i couldn &apos;t get in or out . i was trapped .
the curtains-- they were on fire .
it was horrible .
it &apos;s okay .
i was hunched in a corner ,
and i looked over into the other corner .
in the shadows , there was someone else there .
i just see his eyes . he was looking right at me .
it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s over now .
these nightmares--
they will fade away . i promise .
did they for you ?
yeah . come on .
come on .
i &apos;ll sit with you until you fall back asleep .
who else do i have to take care of ?
they hoarded all of their greatest stolen treasures in here--
piles of jewels ,
and every room filled with coins .
let &apos;s get to it . the compass .
what &apos;s your rush ?
how long do you think magic knockout powder lasts ?
i have no clue .
that &apos;s my rush .
too right , lass .
come . everything we need is right in front of us .
train 643 with stops in cleveland ,
d.c. , and seattle .
now boarding on track ...
talk to that guy , uh ...
what &apos;d he say about our hours ?
they kill all the giant housekeepers , too ?
how we &apos;re gonna find a compass in this mess ?
by looking .
start searching .
i wonder how much treasure we could carry down the beanstalk .
in addition to the compass , of course .
what the hell ?
that ... would be jack .
as in jack--
the giant killer .
with that toothpick ?
well , it packs quite a wallop . you &apos;d be surprised .
it &apos;s about bloody time .
it &apos;s a trip wire .
quite a security system .
well , that &apos;s a plausible excuse for grabbing me ,
but next time , don &apos;t stand on ceremony .
let &apos;s find the compass
and go home .
after you .
oh , thank god .
let &apos;s see &apos; em .
that &apos;s not as many as i thought .
yeah , but they &apos;re super pricey .
this is $ 20,000 easy .
$ 20,000 ?
tallahassee .
listen , i &apos;m gonna go meet the fence .
i &apos;ll meet you with the money .
remember where ?
the parking structure by the tracks .
yes .
9 : 00 sharp .
just so there &apos;s no mix @-@ ups ...
so i guess we &apos;re keeping this one ?
how can we not ? look how good it looks on you .
tallahassee , baby .
we &apos;re almost home .
home ...
you got the wrong guy , officer !
i wasn &apos;t even jaywalking !
it &apos;s not like that .
you want to protect emma ? come with me .
what ?
get up .
how do you know emma ?
name &apos;s august .
and it &apos;s a long story ,
but trust me , you want to hear it .
all right , august .
you &apos;re not a cop ?
who are you ? you got two minutes .
think of me as emma &apos;s guardian angel .
guardian angel ?
i &apos;d say you &apos;ve been doing a pretty crap job .
i &apos;ve been looking for her for the past two years .
now i finally find her ,
and she &apos;s robbing convenience stores with some deadbeat .
tell me again who &apos;s doing the crap job .
let me tell you something .
i &apos;m the best thing that &apos;s ever happened to her .
two years ? where were you the rest of her life ?
i &apos;m not perfect .
this world ? full of temptations .
turns out i &apos;m not that great at saying no .
i &apos;m not built that way .
but i &apos;m here now .
who are you ?
we were in the same home as kids ,
and i thought she &apos;d be safe inside the system ,
but now that she &apos;s out .
back then i promised i would take care of her .
well , we promised to take care of each other .
you love her . good .
that means you have to do right by her .
that &apos;s all i &apos;m trying to do .
then leave her .
never .
she has a destiny ,
and you--this life ?
you &apos;re gonna keep her from it .
okay .
do you believe in magic ?
i take it you do .
so will you ... trust me ?
i &apos;m gonna show you something--
something that &apos;s gonna make you look at everything differently .
and when you see what i have in here , you &apos;re gonna listen .
you &apos;re gonna believe every word i say .
yeah , right .
okay . i &apos;m listening .
there &apos;s a curse ...
and it needs to be broken .
emma is the key .
i was tasked with keeping her on track ,
and you , my friend ,
just got caught in the crossfire .
now i &apos;m gonna tell you a story ,
and at the end of it , you &apos;re gonna have to make a decision .
will you do the right thing ...
or not ?
so ... are you ready ?
the number you are trying to reach is out of service .
if you think you &apos;ve reached this message in error ...
damn right , it &apos;s an error .
unless he set you up .
hands above your head , please , miss .
wait . why ?
possession of stolen goods .
left you holding .
i have nothing .
sorry to tell you , but your boy took off .
probably in canada by now .
he called in a tip , told us to take a look
at the surveillance footage at the train station .
give me the watch .
now !
you know your rights ?
yeah .
good girl . turn around .
where &apos;s the rest of the watches ?
they &apos;re gone .
they &apos;re not coming back .
let &apos;s go .
so it &apos;s just ... in here somewhere ?
allegedly .
give me a boost , would you , love ?
so i can &apos;t see what you &apos;re pocketing ? no way .
you give me a boost .
try something new , darling--
it &apos;s called trust .
we do it side by side , and fast .
who knows how long before the--
someone &apos;s up .
quickly . get under something .
hook ?
been a while .
where &apos;d you go ?
tried to lose myself .
it didn &apos;t work .
i want to talk to you about emma .
i hope you &apos;re not trying to reach out .
i just--i feel like--if-- if i knew that she was okay ,
i could move on .
is she ?
she will be . she got 11 months .
that should be me . i should be doing that time .
no . we went over this . it &apos;s good .
how &apos;s it good ?
it &apos;s a minimum security place in phoenix ,
and no , i am not going to tell you which one .
she &apos;ll get out of there and she &apos;ll be fine .
you keep your promise and steer clear ,
and she can have a good life .
she can do what she &apos;s supposed to do .
and if i can &apos;t be there for her , man ,
you gotta promise me that you will be .
i promise .
all right , then you should do something for me .
i was able to fence the watches .
don &apos;t judge me . i &apos;m giving it all to her .
and the car . i got a clean v.i.n. number for it ,
so it &apos;s legit .
i just ...
it &apos;ll feel like i &apos;m there with her , you know ?
money &apos;s not what she needs-- not for what &apos;s ahead .
can you just see that she gets it ?
sure .
and one more thing .
if anything changes ,
and she does her job ,
this insanity ends , and she &apos;s free--
i &apos;ll send you a postcard .
i &apos;m not what you think !
you &apos;re a thief , and you poisoned me ,
so yeah , i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re exactly what i think .
no . look , you have a compass .
i need it .
i don &apos;t care what you need .
no , for my son !
to save my son !
don &apos;t you have a family ?
no !
because humans killed them all .
nice security system .
efficient .
no . no ! no ! no ! no !
i can tell by your face you know what this is .
let me guess--it &apos;s dipped in some sort of poison .
you have a compass .
i need it .
you &apos;re gonna kill me either way .
go ahead .
kill me .
you don &apos;t know me .
i know your kind .
they massacred us and destroyed our beans .
i heard it the other way .
because the victors get to tell the story .
okay ! stop .
here .
see ?
i &apos;m not the bad guy .
maybe you are telling the truth .
doesn &apos;t really matter .
i have to go . are there any more of you ?
no .
i &apos;m alone .
what &apos;s this ?
is this a bean ?
can this make a portal ?
not anymore .
it was destroyed , like the rest of them .
i wear it as a reminder--
a reminder that you &apos;re all killers .
you &apos;re wrong .
go .
why ?
because you could &apos;ve killed me and you didn &apos;t .
you get one favor . now go before i change my mind .
actually ...
i get two favors .
what ?
well , the way i see it , i could &apos;ve killed you twice--
the poison and when you were knocked out .
i didn &apos;t .
what do you want ?
hook .
you are bloody brilliant .
amazing .
may i see it ?
the compass .
it &apos;s more beautiful than legend .
come . let &apos;s go .
what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
hook , i ...
i @-@ i can &apos;t--
emma , look at me . have i told you a lie ?
i brought you here .
i risked my own safety to help you .
the compass is in your hand . why do this to me now ?
i can &apos;t take a chance that i &apos;m wrong about you .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re sorry ? you &apos;re sorry ? !
i got you here ! i got you the compass !
i got the compass .
you &apos;re just gonna leave me here to die ?
have that beast to eat me , to crush my bones ?
he &apos;s not a beast ,
and you &apos;re not gonna die .
i just need a head start . that &apos;s all .
swan .
swan !
swan !
whoa . wait ! what are you doing ?
just stay back . emma gave me ten hours .
no ! no ! no !
what , you &apos;re gonna just leave her to die ?
ten hours .
she may already be dead .
no .
no !
no ! stop !
stop ! stop !
this was your daughter &apos;s wish !
i don &apos;t care what you say !
you do not put my daughter in danger !
stop !
emma .
you okay ?
two earthquakes and a jump from a beanstalk .
i think my brain &apos;s still rattling around a little .
i did what she ordered ,
nothing more than that .
did you get it ?
yep .
w @-@ where &apos;s hook ?
he &apos;s detained . let &apos;s go . get your stuff .
we got ten hours before he follows us .
what ? how ?
i got a friend looking after him till then .
you told her to cut it down ?
yes . i couldn &apos;t risk--
we go back together .
that is the only way .
do you understand ?
yeah .
good .
now let &apos;s go get that dust from cora .
yeah , and go home .
swan , you got mail .
know anyone in phuket ?
i &apos;ve gotta open this in front of you . those are the rules .
okay . look .
car keys .
hope you got the car it goes with .
nothing else . no letter . sorry .
but good news . you get a car when you get out .
and a baby .
congratulations .
henry ?
henry .
it &apos;s okay .
okay . you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re okay .
i just had the worst nightmare .
it &apos;s over now .
okay .
okay ?
here .
this will help .
a candle ?
yeah . they keep the nightmares away .
okay . now talk to me .
what was so bad ?
i was in this room , and ...
and it was red .
and there was no doors ,
no windows .
and these curtains ...
and they were on fire .
and i was in this corner .
right .
and i was looking up ,
and there was someone else there .
she was staring at me through the flames .
then i woke up and--
hey , don &apos;t worry , all right ?
