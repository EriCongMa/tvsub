penny , hello .
hey , sheldon .
what is shaking ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
it &apos;s colloquial , a conversation opener .
so , do you find the weather satisfying ?
are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ? you &apos;re freaking me out .
i &apos;m striking up a casual conversation with you .
s &apos;up ?
please don &apos;t do that .
all right ,
but i &apos;m given to understand that
when you have something awkward to discuss with someone ,
it &apos;s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat .
so , this wasn &apos;t the awkward part ?
no .
oh , all right .
s &apos;up ?
oh , good , i used that right .
anyway ,
you &apos;re aware that leonard has entered into a new
romantic relationship which includes a sexual component ?
okay , feeling the awkward now .
her name is
dr.stephanie barnett and she is a highly
distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial .
yeah , leonard told me. good .
what he may have left out is
how important this relationship is to me .
to you ?
yes , see , of the handful of women leonard &apos;s been involved with ,
she &apos;s the only one i have ever found tolerable .
well , what about me ?
the statement stands for itself .
well , aren &apos;t you sweet ?
anyway , should you have any interaction with her ,
it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival .
yeah , i think she &apos;s pretty safe .
you say that now , but consider the following senario
you &apos;re sitting in your apartment ,
it &apos;s late , you &apos;re alone .
your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and
progesterone and suddenly even
leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate .
or a , uh , &quot; hookup &quot;
as it &apos;s referred to by today &apos;s urban youth .
really ? yes .
now , should that happen ,
i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido .
i could think about you .
fine , whatever works .
always nice talking to you , sheldon .
uh , peace out !
well , this is very pleasant .
glad you &apos;re enjoying yourself .
and you said there &apos;d never be enough pasta for the three of us .
i stand corrected .
you know , italian housewives have a rule of thumb .
a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is
sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked .
that &apos;s very interesting .
thank you .
she doesn &apos;t mean it. she &apos;s just being nice .
well , stephanie ,
since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball ,
i guess i &apos;ll just have to pick it up .
have you ever witnessed a violent crime ?
no. good .
what &apos;s your favorite fruit ?
uh , strawberries .
hmm , technically not a fruit , but all right .
where did you do your medical internship ?
uh , lawrence memorial in galveston , texas .
really ? that &apos;s where i was born !
you &apos;re kidding !
i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital .
when i was 12 , i got to ride there in a helicopter .
why , w @-@ w @-@ what happened ?
radiation burns .
a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner .
i &apos;m sorry , you tried to build your own cat scanner ?
no , i didn &apos;t try , i succeeded .
in fact , i was briefly able to see
the inside of my sister &apos;s guinea pig ,
snowball , before he caught fire .
it led to an interesting
&quot; not a snowball &apos;s chance in a cat scanner . &quot;
uh , sheldon ?
excuse me .
when i come back , just for fun ,
the subject will be alternative history .
specifically ,
how would the civil war have gone differently
if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future ?
look at that , there &apos;s even pasta left over .
do you understand that this was supposed to be a date ?
i do .
do you ? because frankly ,
you &apos;ve been in a foul mood since i sat down .
okay , here &apos;s my question. why did you sit down ?
to help .
look , if you fail at this relationship ,
and history suggests you will ,
then we risk losing the medical officer
that our landing party has always needed .
what landing party ?
you &apos;re kirk , i &apos;m spock , wolowitz is scotty ,
koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed ...
and now we &apos;ve got mccoy .
so ,
we &apos;re all standing around looking at the post @-@ op x ray
and there it is ,
clear as day , right in the guy &apos;s chest cavity ...
one of my earrings .
oh , my god , what did you do ?
what do you think i did ?
i discreetly slipped off the other earring ,
put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there !
i have a bone to pick with you , sir .
hi , sheldon .
hi , stephanie .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late ,
but yourompanion left the most indecipherable invitation .
what invitation ?
&quot; we &apos;re going to the movies . &quot;
what movie ? what theater ? what time ?
if you were trying to make it impossible to locate you ,
you couldn &apos;t have done a better job .
oh , clearly i could have .
it took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser
history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up .
wait here , i &apos;ll find us seats .
uh , no , we have seats .
not the right seats .
what is he doing ?
he &apos;s finding the acoustic sweet spot .
does he always do this ?
sometimes he brings a toy xylophone .
i am really sorry about this .
no , it &apos;s fine. you know , he &apos;s sweet .
my apologies , you &apos;ve been sitting in it all along .
leonard , you want to slide over one ?
no , just sit here .
oh , yeah , this is it .
leonard .
leonard ? leonard ? !
what , sheldon ?
what , sheldon ? ! what , sheldon ? !
tell me what you see here .
the blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial ?
this is stephanie &apos;s facebook page .
now , where it should say &quot; in a relationship , &quot; what does it say ?
&quot; stephanie barnett is single . &quot;
yeah , furthermore , earlier this evening ,
she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike .
who &apos;s mike ? !
why does he get a digital sheep and not you ?
it &apos;s just her facebook page and we &apos;ve
only been going out a couple of weeks .
you don &apos;t see it , do you ?
we &apos;re losing her .
okay , i &apos;m going to make this very simple for you .
you are not in this relationship .
i am .
ergo , you have no say in anything
that happens between me and stephanie .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t allow that .
pursuant to starfleet general order 104 section a ,
you are deemed unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command .
general order 104 , section a does not apply in this situation .
give me one good reason why not .
because this is not startrek
penny ?
penny ? penny ? !
what ?
this is banana bread .
this is a door knob .
it &apos;s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can
be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat .
sheldon , would you like to come in ?
i suppose i could spare a few minutes .
were you robbed ?
no .
how can you be sure ?
sheldon , what do you want ?
i &apos;m certain this will come as no surprise to you ,
but leonard is failing in yet another relationship .
he &apos;s having problems with stephanie ?
she &apos;s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet .
if i have any hope of keeping them together , i need data .
specifically ,
i need to know exactly what leonard did that
caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks .
what ?
again , urban slang .
in which , i believe i &apos;m gaining remarkable fluency .
so , what is the &quot; down &quot; and the &quot; low &quot; ?
and don &apos;t worry , this is all entirely confidential , so ,
you feel free to include
any and all shortcomings in the bedroom .
we never got to the bedroom .
because ?
oh , okay , all right , you know what ?
i &apos;ll tell you what happened .
we were young , we were very much in love ,
but we could only communicate through a
time @-@ traveling mailbox at my lake house .
it &apos;s not enough that you made me watch that movie ,
but now you mock me with it ?
gentlemen , i have a question about dating and relationships .
you told me you were going to have the talk with him .
i &apos;ve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me .
more to the point ,
it &apos;s about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together .
oh , i don &apos;t think you can .
well , why not ?
look at leonard &apos;s record .
27 days with joyce kim .
during which she defected to north korea .
two booty calls with leslie winkle .
for which she awarded him the nickname &quot; speed of light leonard . &quot;
and the three hour dinner with penny .
which would have been two and a half if
they ordered the souffle when they sat down .
based on the geometric progression ,
his relationship with stephanie
should have ended after 20 minutes .
yes , i &apos;m aware of the math .
y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth .
the issue remains .
how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection ?
well , if you want to guarantee his appeal to stephanie ,
your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet .
i &apos;ll tell you what you shouldn &apos;t do .
don &apos;t shpritz him with that body spray from the
commercial where the women undress when they smell it .
that doesn &apos;t work at all .
no matter how much you put on .
so , that &apos;s all you &apos;ve got ?
apocalyptic genocide and &quot; go easy on the cologne &quot; ?
yeah. yes .
penny .
penny ?
what ?
penny ?
zucchini bread .
oh , thank you .
may i come in ?
no .
i see .
apparently ,
my earlier inquiry regarding
you and leonard crossed some sort of line .
i apologize .
well , thank you .
so , have you and i returned to a social equilibrium ?
yes. great .
new topic .
where are you in your menstrual cycle ?
what ? !
i &apos;ve been doing some research online ,
and apparently female primates ,
you know , uh , apes , chimpanzees , you .
they find their mate more desirable
when he &apos;s being courted by another female .
now , this effect is intensified when the rival female
is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation .
which brings me back to my question .
where are you in your--
clearly , i &apos;m 14 days too early .
all i &apos;m saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria ,
why can &apos;t they do something about lactose intolerance ?
leonard , you &apos;re going to have to let this go .
you had a little cheese dip , you farted .
i thought it was cute .
oh , hi , stephanie .
wanna more wine ?
yeah , i &apos;m not driving anywhere tonight .
what are you doing ?
i have a craving for white asparagus
that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied .
excuse me .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i &apos;m helping you with stephanie .
by making constipated moose sounds ?
when i fail to open this jar and you succeed ,
it will establish you as the &quot; alpha &quot; male .
you see ...
when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination ,
she produces the hormone oxytocin .
if the two of you then engage in intercourse ,
this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain
which lay people naively interpret as &quot; falling in love . &quot;
would it work if i just punched you in the face ?
yes , actually it would , but let &apos;s see how the lid goes .
i &apos;m not strong enough , leonard , you &apos;ll have to do it .
oh , for god &apos;s sakes .
go ahead , it &apos;s pre @-@ loosened .
do you want some help with that ?
no , no , no , i got it .
no , yeah , yeah , he &apos;s got it , and that &apos;s not surprising .
this is something i long ago came to
peace with in my role as the beta male .
open it .
oh , my god , are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m bleeding .
like a gladiator !
oh , honey , you &apos;re going to need stitches .
stitches ? with a needle ?
well , yeah , i mean , just a few .
oh , okay , yeah , hang on a sec .
fyi , i was defrosting a steak in there .
what a beautiful job stephanie did .
i might have gone with a mattress suture
instead of a blanket stitch ,
but you can &apos;t argue with her results .
it &apos;s a shame it won &apos;t scar .
the war wound is a time @-@ honored badge of masculinity .
i can &apos;t remember a time when you weren &apos;t talking .
just for the record ,
my efforts to establish you as the alpha
male were not aided by you bursting into tears .
i did not burst into tears , my eyes just got a little watery .
watery ?
she stuck a needle into my hand !
hey , how &apos;s my big cry baby ?
i didn &apos;t cry .
okay , i &apos;m just teasing you .
but , yeah , you did .
okay , it &apos;s all good .
what do you say we get you home and put you to bed ?
oh , are you still going to spend the night ?
uh , no , i think that you probably need to rest .
she &apos;s right. as long as you &apos;re vomiting ,
coitus is contra @-@ indicated .
thank you , dr. cooper .
you &apos;re welcome , dr. hofstadter .
okay , i &apos;m going to go get your discharge papers .
what ?
well , you seem like a perfectly pleasant person .
i can &apos;t understand why women have such a hard time loving you .
hey , can you open this for me ?
can i see your stitches ?
sure .
answering the question once and for all
why wolowitz bailed out of medical school .
leonard , congratulations .
what for ?
your facebook status update .
leonard hofstadter is &quot; in a relationship . &quot;
what ? no. no , that &apos;s not right .
oh , man , did you switch your status before she did ?
speaking as an expert , way to look needy .
seriously ?
you went first , after only two weeks ?
that &apos;s bold ...
it &apos;s not bold , it &apos;s a mistake .
i didn &apos;t change my status .
well , then who did ?
i had no choice. he cried in front of her .
you hacked my facebook account ?
oh , it &apos;s hardly hacking
when you use the same password for everything ,
&quot; kal @-@ el . &quot;
are you insane ?
now she &apos;s going to think i &apos;m desperate .
you &apos;ve destroyed this relationship !
and you want to know what the worst part is ?
you don &apos;t even understand what you did wrong because you
can &apos;t conceive of something that you are not an expert in !
in which i am not an expert .
don &apos;t even !
i don &apos;t want to hear another word out of you .
what &apos;s wrong , lassie ? timmy fall down the well ?
she just updated her facebook status .
&quot; stephanie barnett is in a relationship
with leonard hofstadter . &quot;
really ?
oh , look at that .
i have a girlfriend .
if i am permitted to speak again ,
