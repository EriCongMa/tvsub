okay . found you .
i do have an open seat in first class ,
if one of you would like a free upgrade .
no , thank you . i think we &apos;ll sit together .
after the amazing weekend we just had --
i &apos;ll take it .
i deserved that seat .
three days in the woods with
phil &apos;s ex @-@ cheerleader buddies --
the old stories ,
the spontaneous human pyramids ,
constantly updating their tumbler tumblr --
i smiled through the whole thing .
problem is i was so convincing ,
phil thought i was having a great time .
what do i want ? some credit .
when do i want it ? now .
i &apos;m sorry if i smell like a campfire .
i &apos;ve been in the woods for three days .
i hate camping .
if i &apos;m ever in the woods for three days ,
it means i &apos;ve been dead for two of them .
it feels good to laugh for real .
you look like you need a drink .
hon ?
two chardonnays and a hot towel for my friend .
right away .
i love you , beautiful stranger .
i have to admit , i was a little miffed
that claire grabbed the good seat ,
especially after i gave her such a magical weekend ,
but i was determined to stay positive .
and then it hit me .
everybody , sal &apos;s here .
okay .
all right .
is this straight ?
you &apos;re throwing a baby shower
with a dozen men in tailored pants
sipping bellinis .
nothing about this is -- ugh , i can &apos;t even finish .
really ? the last word was too much ?
so , we decided to get the gang together
to throw our friend sal a belated baby shower .
she &apos;s been a little hard to pin down lately ,
but we knew she &apos;d never miss the chance
to shower with a bunch of men .
you love that joke , don &apos;t you ?
well , because it &apos;s two different kinds of showers .
this is little sammy .
this is as long
as you &apos;ve ever been in our house without a cocktail .
no , thank you . just a water , please .
okay , everybody , drop your pearls .
i &apos;m still breastfeeding .
all the books say , &quot; do it at least a year . &quot;
jotham , drink this .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m leaving early to go to a hockey game .
kings versus blackhawks .
they can call a team that ?
black hawks .
i &apos;ve got to put this in the kitchen .
i make all my own baby food .
it &apos;s all @-@ natural , no chemicals .
uh , who is this woman ?
she &apos;s not drinking , she &apos;s making her own baby food .
does lily have any other plates ?
i don &apos;t let sammy eat off this plastic .
uh , yeah , the far cabinet .
okay . none of this makes sense .
i know . how does she breastfeed him
if she doesn &apos;t let him near plastic ?
mom , do i have a fever ?
ay , let me check .
you know , we have a thermometer .
do you have to be so white all the time ?
oh , baby , go lay down .
you &apos;re such a brave , little boy !
he &apos;s faking it .
he &apos;s pretending to be sick
so he doesn &apos;t have to go to his cooking class .
he has to go . today &apos;s lasagna .
i &apos;ve been starving myself all day for that .
he doesn &apos;t want to go
because there &apos;s a boy there that is picking on him .
cooking class ?
you know , we &apos;re running out of places to send him
where he can be cool .
i know . enough is enough .
you have to teach him how to fight .
yeah . that &apos;ll work .
you &apos;re doing this .
and don &apos;t tell him that this is coming from me .
it &apos;s bad for a boy to know that his mother thinks he &apos;s weak .
that &apos;s a lifetime of paying women
to spank him until he cries .
the kid is just not a fighter .
he gets squeamish pounding veal .
just do it !
fine , but i &apos;m only doing it for the lasagna
and the extra food he &apos;s been bringing home on sundays .
makes mondays easier , you know ?
oh , my god , you &apos;re the garfield .
one of you pretty ladies
want to take me to meet a girl later ?
you think calling us pretty is gonna get you a ride ?
i &apos;ll take it .
let me know when you want to leave .
besides , i like rose . i think she &apos;s good for you .
this is a new girl -- sarah .
i &apos;m done with rose . she crazy .
easy , macklemore .
what do you mean , &quot; crazy &quot; ?
i &apos;ll tell you what he means .
any time a woman challenges a man in any way ,
suddenly , she &apos;s crazy .
so , what did she do that was so crazy , luke --
give you her opinion ?
yeah , or what , did she dare to talk about her feelings ?
the words sound like you get it ,
but your tone is throwing me .
just tell me you said something nice when you broke up with her .
i haven &apos;t broken up with her .
what ? !
it just seems weird
to call someone up and give them bad news .
she &apos;ll find out somehow .
ugh . ugh , when did you become a guy ? it &apos;s gross .
you need to stand up and face her .
in person ?
what are we , 30 ? send her a text .
you need to break it to her gently .
first , tell her she &apos;s awesome .
and pretty .
if she was awesome and pretty ,
i wouldn &apos;t be dumping her .
just do it , you pig .
we all know i &apos;m not gonna do it ,
so if you want it done , here .
oh , and don &apos;t go looking around on there .
it &apos;s not gonna make you like me more .
&apos;s @-@ scuse me . i think you &apos;re in my seat .
sir , we think you &apos;re in her seat .
no , i &apos;m definitely 16c .
this is 19c .
oh , darn it , that &apos;s three rows up .
sorry about that .
that &apos;s all right .
hi . welcome .
um , could you hang back a second ?
i @-@ i dropped my phone .
i may have , uh , what you &apos;re looking for ...
right there .
wait . what ?
hi . i &apos;m a professional magician .
holy sword @-@ box , you &apos;re edward legrand .
yeah , i am . i am .
i @-@ i &apos;m phil dunphy ,
p @-@ professional realtor , amateur magician .
well , nice to meet you .
hi . i &apos;m jillian .
i &apos;ve been told i have magic hands .
i &apos;m a masseuse .
why do you keep rubbing your forearm like that ?
oh , i @-@ i had a suitcase land on me .
oh , let me see .
hey , phil ... ohh .
... i &apos;ve got a great new trick i want to show you .
oh ! ooh , i can do tricks , too .
this spot &apos;s connected to your tongue .
can i stow your bag for you ?
no , we &apos;ll be needing this .
trashy magazines .
oh , you &apos;re the best .
ooh . caramel truffles .
i even brought an extra fluffy neck pillow .
oh , this must be what a mother &apos;s hug feels like .
hello ?
well , it looks like she &apos;s taking good care of you .
well , she is my best friend .
listen to me , julio .
i want the gutters cleaned today , not manana .
if everyone thought my people were lazy ,
i would do whatever it took to not seem lazy .
comprende ?
actually , we &apos;re gonna take off soon ,
so we &apos;re gonna need you to turn off your phone .
i &apos;m actually not done talking , and two more .
well , if i were you ,
i &apos;d put down the burrito and get up that ladder .
what are you doing standing there
and not getting drinks for me and my good friend , claire ?
actually , we just met .
oh , guys , guys ,
i can &apos;t let you do the cleanup all by yourselves .
ronaldo will help you .
of course !
uh , where is sal ?
i need her keys to start loading the gifts in her car .
i think she &apos;s changing sammy in our room .
i hope she &apos;s also changing those drapes .
i don &apos;t want to sound like a sentimental softy ,
but does anyone miss
the drunken whore she used to be ?
oh , i like the new sal .
turns out , all she needed to bring out her maternal instinct
was a little baby .
i don &apos;t buy it . no , something &apos;s up .
you do remember her suggesting we chuck lily into the ocean .
oh , mitchell , calm down . babies change people .
like you used to be a judgmental cynic ,
and then lily -- oh , wait .
you guys , sal &apos;s not back there .
sal ?
the drapes still are .
well , that &apos;s weird . her car &apos;s gone .
what ? !
let &apos;s not jump to conclusions .
in this neighborhood , her car could have been stolen .
well , you know , she did seem frazzled .
may-- maybe she forgot to say goodbye .
oh , and forgot all of her presents .
and forgot her baby .
you don &apos;t think that there &apos;s any way that she would --
n @-@ no .
i @-@ i can &apos;t even say it .
i can .
that gin @-@ soaked tart abandoned the little bastard .
what ? he &apos;s fatherless .
am i wrong ?
okay , i &apos;ve called sal five times ,
and she still hasn &apos;t picked up .
i knew this whole &quot; earth mother &quot; thing was an act .
oh , maybe we should use our happy voices
when we &apos;re accusing a mommy
of abandoning her little baby boy .
ugh . this is a true disaster .
isn &apos;t it ?
someone put a spanish roof
on what is clearly a mid @-@ century ranch .
oh , no .
someone just went numero two .
and the aftershocks are still rolling in .
here &apos;s her diaper bag . and ... what &apos;s --
oh , no . this , here &apos;s a note .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry to leave this way .
i &apos;m not proud of it ,
but i just can &apos;t do this anymore .
goodbye . sal . &quot;
it &apos;s getting harder and harder
to keep a positive spin on this .
here . have some cheese .
oh , no . thank you . i &apos;m , i &apos;m good .
oh , my .
that is strong .
oh , my goodness .
hey . what are you staring at ?
it &apos;s french cheese .
costs more than you make in a week .
okay , you might want to keep your voice down .
claire .
yeah ?
that guy over there is checking you out !
i don &apos;t think he is .
my friend claire would like to meet you in the bathroom .
no . i @-@ i did not say that .
claire , why do you do that to yourself ?
you are so pretty .
hey , phil , what time is it ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
my watch is gone , edward ,
what did you do ?
jillian , what &apos;s your middle initial ?
&quot; c , &quot; for catherine .
and , phil , what age were you when you first kissed a girl ?
12 cousin , 14 non @-@ cousin .
let &apos;s stick with non @-@ cousin .
i think if you go to 14c , seat right over there ,
you &apos;ll wind up with what you &apos;re looking for .
it works on battery ,
but , oh , my god , i &apos;m excited !
excuse me .
phil . it &apos;s me .
oh , hey .
what are you doing back here ?
i need a break
from the woman i &apos;m sitting next to up there .
she is the worst person on earth .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was hoping she might be a little less aggressive with you .
do you mind switching with me for a little while ?
oh , honey , you don &apos;t want to .
it &apos;s hell back here , too .
i &apos;m squished between this fat lady
who keeps digging into my elbow
and this huge , sweaty dude
who won &apos;t stop blabbing on about his job .
well , could i get a hug ? i could really use one .
sure thing . they want us back in our seats .
i didn &apos;t hear the little ding .
your ears must be plugged .
did you feel that ?
no , i @-@ i @-@ i didn &apos;t feel anything .
this is scary . you should go back .
amazing .
thank you .
sorcerer !
not bad . i felt that one .
so good , manny .
all right , really let one go this time .
thinks about how mad this guy makes you .
what &apos;s his name ?
gideon .
oh , geez .
all right , think about what he did to you .
i &apos;d rather not talk about it .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re smiling . your fennel &apos;s burnt .
whereas i made a perfect butternut squash .
that &apos;s just butter .
oh , yeah , i @-@ i totally forgot the nut squash !
snap it . snap it . good .
more . good .
i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m not fighting anymore . it &apos;s not worth it .
but you &apos;re doing so good .
you just have to turn your shoulder first
so that you can throw your weight behind your punch .
if you want .
i already think that you &apos;re very tough .
this is all jay &apos;s idea .
all right . come on , kid . show them who &apos;s boss .
no . i &apos;m more of a lover than a fighter .
well , that &apos;s the goal , anyway .
okay , papi , whatever you decide .
don &apos;t let him leave this room !
maybe you should teach him how to hit .
oh , my god . check it out .
rose got your breakup text and wrote back .
she mad .
what ? give me that .
&quot; thanks for the dumbest breakup text ever .
don &apos;t call a girl awesome , then break up with her .
if i &apos;m so great , why &apos;d you dump me ?
get over yourself , you insensitive troll &quot; ?
what is her problem ? she can &apos;t talk to you like that .
she &apos;s not . she &apos;s talking to you .
i can &apos;t believe i ever liked this girl .
our text was compassionate and respectful .
there was nothing dumb about it .
a million percent .
what are you doing ?
this crazy bitch just messed with the wrong crazy bitch .
this is unreal .
we always knew sal was unstable ,
but how could she do this ?
we don &apos;t know that she &apos;s done anything .
okay , let &apos;s just suppose for a second
that she &apos;s on a plane to cabo .
what then ?
maybe this is part of a bigger plan .
you know , maybe the reason
we didn &apos;t adopt another baby after lily
was because god wanted us available for sammy .
who is this god that denies us a baby ,
then gets a party girl pregnant ,
only to have her desert the baby
so that we can finally get one ?
the same god that impregnated a virgin ,
sent moses down the river in a basket ,
and commanded abraham to stab his own son .
god only does weird baby stuff .
okay , yes , i &apos;ll admit ,
there is part of me that would love to keep this little guy
and raise him the way sal was pretending to .
exactly . lily could have a baby brother .
but there are systems in place here .
you can &apos;t just keep him
like a bunny you found in the yard .
that &apos;s crazy .
listen , we discussed it ,
and we think we should take the kid .
what should we call him ?
not sure , but definitely not sammy .
sammy saltzman sounds so silly .
we can overhand shuffle ,
and we can riffle shuffle ...
but , you know ,
there is no escape from the angry ...
queen .
what ?
phil . what are you doing ?
making the best of a bad situation ?
why is that woman rubbing your shoulders ?
oh , uh , jillian is a masseuse ,
and this , of course , is edward legrand .
pleasure to meet you .
now , if you could just give me my ace of spades back ,
it &apos;s in your pocket .
this is why you had to race back to your hellish seat --
for back rubs and card tricks ?
do you have any idea what i &apos;m going through up there ?
she clipped her toenails
because her &quot; oriental girl &quot; didn &apos;t do it right .
claire , i &apos;m sorry .
but i need you to check your pocket .
insanity !
thank you very much .
don &apos;t be mad at me .
you &apos;re the one who grabbed that seat .
that was a pretty selfish move .
yeah , i did grab that seat ,
because i spent the entire weekend being selfless ,
and you didn &apos;t even thank me once .
why would i thank you
for giving you an awesome weekend ?
awesome ?
you spent the whole weekend rehashing stories
about itchy , rusty , and loveboat .
how is that fun for me ? !
they were always getting into stuff !
i came back here for some compassion ,
and all you did was lie to me and blow me off
so you could keep having your fun
while i suffer up there in first class !
oh , my heart goes out to you .
oh , stick it , kreskin .
i &apos;m sitting next to a cheese @-@ eating racist .
形容法国人
i &apos;m sorry about your card .
don &apos;t be .
son of a ...
all right .
i &apos;ll be back -- pick you up at 6 : 00 .
now , remember , what did i teach you ?
violence solves everything ,
and don &apos;t wind my fist up like popeye .
it &apos;s not violence . it &apos;s self @-@ defense .
you cannot let this kid keep pushing you around .
now , you walk in there like a badass ,
and you make the best damn lasagna anybody &apos;s ever seen .
i appreciate the speech , jay ,
but i &apos;ll handle things my way .
kid , one more thing .
don &apos;t forget the garlic bread .
because without that ... i-
i get it .
hey , delgado .
manny , i &apos;m talking to you .
you want a piece of this ?
ow ! what was that for ?
looks like i gave you a piece of this .
what the hell ?
i was just offering you some apple crumble !
what ? you were not .
yes , i was ! i felt bad about teasing you .
my therapist said
i was acting out because of my parents &apos; divorce ,
so i was trying to be nice .
i &apos;m so sorry . i didn &apos;t know !
good shot , kid !
that &apos;ll teach you who to pick on , you punk --
not my boy !
he learned how to punch from the best .
his parents are getting divorced ,
and he made me that dessert as an apology .
this whole thing was your mother &apos;s idea .
ronaldo , you grab the roller thingy , and , uh --
oh ! i &apos;ll grab that big mesh cage .
all right . everybody , stop .
you can &apos;t just keep a baby
like it &apos;s some rabbit you found in the yard .
there are systems in place .
he has to stay somewhere tonight , no ?
yeah , how about right here ,
because we know how to raise a child ?
oh , please .
we &apos;ll dress him and feed him ,
and conchetta can handle the poopy stuff .
i gave her obamacare .
it &apos;s the least she can do .
we all want what &apos;s best for the baby .
y @-@ you &apos;re very nice people , but we &apos;ve done this before .
so ? it &apos;s our turn .
i wanted a child for some time now .
my biological clock is ticking .
that &apos;s the most ridiculous thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
is it ? i &apos;m 44 .
or that is .
you are one mean lady .
we &apos;re not leaving without felipe .
well , then , you &apos;re not leaving .
fine !
did we settle on &quot; felipe &quot; ?
phil .
honey , what are you doing ?
one second .
so , i have 20 fur coats in my closet ,
but i &apos;m the only one of my friends
who even wears them anymore ,
so you tell me who &apos;s endangered .
jillian &apos;s waiting for you in my seat
to give you a little back rub .
you don &apos;t have to do this .
you didn &apos;t have to be so great this weekend .
but you were , so thank you .
and i should have said that earlier .
go enjoy the rest of your flight .
i &apos;ll deal with this .
&quot; deal with this &quot; ?
i &apos;m a state senator &apos;s mistress .
you &apos;re my hero .
wipe your feet before you come in !
listen to that . first thing out of her mouth ,
she &apos;s telling us what to do .
well , that stops today .
we go in strong . we hold our ground .
we let her know she &apos;s done pushing us around .
manny , why are you home so early ?
did you let him skip school ?
no , mom .
i was kicked out
for punching a really misunderstood kid ,
thanks to you .
thanks to me ? what , did --
i told him everything .
and you know what we realized ?
there is a bully in our life ,
and it &apos;s you .
you make the rules , you boss us around ,
and we &apos;re not gonna take it anymore .
mm . yeah .
ah , look at you two ,
standing up to the big , scary bully
that loves you and protects you
and wants you to be safe in this world .
you &apos;re just tiny , little men to me right now ,
and you need to leave this house and come back with more respect !
and a pizza .
oh , what ?
you need to go first and check on your mascara ?
we do need to eat .
yeah .
i wouldn &apos;t mind some pizza .
we &apos;re not getting any pineapple .
you are getting pineapple !
we &apos;re taking it off our slices .
don &apos;t waste any food , jay !
i think we made our point .
totally .
we &apos;ll get our own pizza -- eat it in the car .
give me one reason
why sammy should stay here tonight
instead of with us .
because we &apos;re experienced parents .
we have a crib !
we have a pediatrician .
our house is babyproofed .
our house was in architectural digest .
ronaldo , please , you &apos;re not helping .
they don &apos;t know what that is .
how can you even fit another child in this shoe box ?
you &apos;re poor !
we have a beautiful house with a big yard
where he could throw the ball with the gardener .
okay , look .
if anybody &apos;s gonna adopt sammy , it &apos;s gonna be us .
whoa ! do i have any say in this ?
sal ! oh , well , you &apos;re back .
what the hell are you four doing ?
you walked out of here
and left your baby without saying a word ,
so maybe we &apos;ll be asking the questions .
i told john john where i was going .
the drunkest guy at the party .
excuse me for not wanting
to interrupt your fierce debate --
&quot; who &apos;s hotter ,
mr. clean or the brawny paper towel man ? &quot;
mr. clean .
brawny paper towel guy .
we &apos;re not going back there .
that still doesn &apos;t explain why you would leave
in the middle of your own baby shower .
i got freaked out when jotham mentioned the blackhawks .
every time . i hear it every time .
sammy &apos;s dad is on the team , okay ?
and he didn &apos;t know sammy existed --
at least not until i just went down there
and i told him .
oh , gosh . what happened ? how did he take it ?
it turns out he &apos;s married .
yeah , i could have googled that .
so he &apos;s out .
and you thought i deserted my own baby ?
you did leave .
and then what -- what &apos;s up with this note , huh ?
look -- &quot; i &apos;m sorry to leave this way .
i &apos;m not proud of it , but i just can &apos;t do this . &quot;
this diaper bag
is just a recycled purse from my single days !
i got a lot of these notes lying around
for quick getaways .
you guys don &apos;t think that i can do this , do you ?
no !
we always thought you could do it .
i certainly don &apos;t .
we don &apos;t think you can &apos;t do it .
shut up !
i don &apos;t think i can do it , either !
oh , sal .
i mean , it &apos;s just
so hard .
i feel so guilty that he doesn &apos;t have a dad in the picture .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m trying to do everything perfectly .
it &apos;s exhausting .
and i haven &apos;t had sex in like a year .
this little dude --
he &apos;s the one thing in my life that i cannot mess up .
i just wish i could give him a dad .
well ... what about us ?
we could be sammy &apos;s dad . all of us .
yeah , sal , we love you ,
and we &apos;re always here for you -- whatever you need .
except we &apos;ll be in capri all of july .
seriously , sal ,
you and sammy will never be alone .
you guys are so sweet .
wait . june &apos;s no good , either .
i &apos;m getting my neck done .
oh my god . what did you do ?
we stuck up for you .
yeah . rose had it coming .
she can &apos;t talk to you the way we do .
well , rose forwarded your texts to sarah .
and now sarah doesn &apos;t want to go out with me .
give me that phone .
what did the skank sarah say to you ?
yeah ouch . good opening .
so funny . we totally deserve that .
totally . good sense of humor .
oh my god . i love her .
me too .
don &apos;t worry luke . we &apos;re gonna win her back .
we &apos;re just go ...
luke !
you think maybe we need dates of our own ?
so bad .
