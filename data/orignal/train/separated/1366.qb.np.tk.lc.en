it &apos;s a total loss .
your credit cards are just the tip of the iceberg .
you &apos;ve been hacked .
the web address contained a compressed video file .
that &apos;s my apartment .
from before the fire .
wasn &apos;t an accident .
is that lianne sampson ?
what ?
the victim from the scene i just came from .
she had a tattoo of a butterfly on her left wrist .
isles .
homicide ?
i &apos;m on my way .
hello ?
hello ?
keys in her car . wallet &apos;s in her purse .
they didn &apos;t want anything but maura .
look , we got roadblocks at all the major thoroughfares .
we got every camera , public and private ,
in the neighborhood .
all units that are available are on the way .
we &apos;re talking to everyone we can find .
what was she doin &apos; here ?
i spoke to dispatch . there was no incident at this location .
obviously , she thought there was .
she brought her medical bag .
somebody made her think there was .
can i touch that right now ?
sure .
uh , this isn &apos;t official .
must &apos;ve got it at a party shop .
i &apos;ll bet he picked this location
because there wouldn &apos;t be any looky @-@ loos
to give it away as a fake crime scene .
guys , the last call that she got
before i tried her was from an internal b.p.d. number .
you think someone from the department
is involved with this ?
get back to headquarters .
you find out where that call came from .
there &apos;s a black smudge there . might be a footprint .
if i wasn &apos;t so concentrated on ma , then --
this is not your fault .
how could you possibly anticipate
that someone would lure maura into a trap ?
you were just protecting
the most vulnerable person in your circle .
and maura -- - is strong .
she &apos;s smart . she is capable .
she will do her part .
now we have to do our part , right ?
detective rizzoli .
yeah ?
i think i found some blood ,
maybe some other biological material .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just a little bit ,
which is a good thing , right ?
fast track everything ,
including that black stuff over there .
yeah .
yeah , that &apos;s great . we -- we -- we got some blood
and a phone number and a footprint .
that &apos;s not a lot to go on .
doesn &apos;t mean we won &apos;t find her . hmm ?
we &apos;ll find her .
that b.p.d. number in maura &apos;s call log
came from operations .
there &apos;s been a shift change since it was placed ,
so all the people who were working have gone home .
we reached out and asked everyone to come back in .
jane .
did you hear what we said ?
yeah .
and if those people aren &apos;t back here in 15 minutes ,
then send uniforms to go get &apos; em .
you really think this is an inside job ?
i hope not , but based on what we know ,
that &apos;s where we gotta start .
jane , are you okay ?
yeah .
&apos;cause you &apos;ve been up a long time .
s--we all have . uh ...
okay , lianne sampson &apos;s murder
and maura &apos;s abduction are related ,
so anything that we need for either case --
uh , warrants , private security videos ,
shoe leather -- i &apos;ll get it .
okay .
okay .
oh , and , uh , we need to put a trap and trace
on maura &apos;s cell phone and her home phone ,
just in case the kidnappers call .
already done .
and we also rerouted your air card
so we can keep an eye on you .
okay .
chief wants a task force , but because we can &apos;t rule out
that someone from b.p.d. is involved ,
he &apos;s gonna give us 24 hours before he puts it in motion .
we don &apos;t have 24 hours .
this isn &apos;t a standard kidnapping .
and just because we don &apos;t get a demand for ransom in 12 hours ,
it doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;ve decided to kill her .
no , that &apos;s true . she could already be dead .
how about we work more , randomly theorize less ?
fair enough .
hi . you hear anything ?
no .
what &apos;s this ?
turkey sandwich , side of carrot ,
baked sweet potato chips , and a brownie .
homemade brownie .
thank you , ma .
hey , ma .
everyone from the previous dispatch shift
has been contacted
and should be in the building within a half an hour .
okay , good .
tuna fish .
thanks , ma .
how you doing ?
all i can do is make sandwiches , so lousy .
you know ...
i worked so hard
to deal with my feelings about your job .
i just didn &apos;t know i was supposed to be dealing
with my feelings for her job , too .
we &apos;re gonna find her , ma .
tell korsak ...
that &apos;s ham and cheese .
still working on the footprint .
what about the blood ?
the d.n.a. tests are in process ,
should be back any minute .
but the blood &apos;s o @-@ positive , so ...
it &apos;s not hers .
no .
possibly the perpetrator was injured during the abduction .
well , it &apos;s not random .
she bit him or punched him in the nose ,
just something to leave us a breadcrumb .
you ... do know that in the fairy tale ,
the breadcrumbs lead to the witch &apos;s house ,
which led the children ...
oh . which is neither here nor there , is it ?
it &apos;s not a witch . it &apos;s not a big , bad wolf .
it &apos;s just some jackass that we gotta get to
before he hurts maura .
right .
hey , uh , d.n.a. results came back .
no match in our system ,
but we are we looking for a white male ,
probably of middle european descent .
that &apos;s it ?
yeah .
i know it &apos;s not very helpful .
well , it eliminates people ,
and that &apos;s better than adding them , right ?
i &apos;ll pass it along .
all right .
look , i &apos;ve been through this dispatch log twice .
no incoming calls at that time
would &apos;ve required a referral to the m.e. &apos; s office .
okay , but the call that dr. isles received
did come from your department .
i can &apos;t explain that .
you having problems with anybody who works for you ?
no .
anybody leave sick last night ?
stan mcqueen .
is he a white male ?
yes .
mcqueen &apos;s not our guy .
he &apos;s been in a wheelchair since before you joined the force .
some kind of a boating accident .
detectives , everyone in operations
has been thoroughly vetted .
they wouldn &apos;t do something like this .
okay , well , someone called the m.e. &apos; s office ,
and they knew enough about our dispatch process
to fool dr. isles .
so have you seen anyone unusual ?
has anyone been nosin &apos; around ,
asking questions ? anything .
sergeant miller ?
last week , i got a call from an eighth grade girl
who said she was doing a report on the 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 system .
she asked about our process and protocols .
what , like how calls come in ?
or when we call the m.e. &apos; s office ?
things like that ?
yeah .
okay , we need to know exactly when you got that call
so we can trace it .
of course .
i &apos;ll have to check the logs downstairs .
like now .
i &apos;ll meet you back in the squad room .
all right .
what do you got , holiday ?
based on the time that sergeant miller gave you ,
i tracked the call he received to a burner phone .
turns out that same phone pinged off a cell tower
near maura &apos;s abduction site ,
at the time of her abduction .
then why did her caller i.d. show an internal b.p.d. number ?
there are apps that will let you spoof your caller i.d.
it &apos;s illegal to use them for criminal purposes ,
but as long as you &apos;re already involved in a criminal activity ...
why sweat the small stuff ?
exactly .
is it also easy to pretend you &apos;re a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl ?
or did our kidnapper get a teenager involved ?
go ahead .
go ahead what ?
go ahead what ?
maura &apos;s abduction was not an inside job .
no , and our fake teenage call to dispatch
came in last week ,
so the kidnapper had time to plan things .
probably gonna make him much harder to find .
i know .
anything ?
the tarry substance that made the smudges at the crime scene ,
that was from bleeding asphalt .
please tell me you have something more than that ,
because there &apos;s about 35,000 miles of road in massachusetts .
35,590 , to be precise .
but who &apos;s counting ?
yeah , i did find something else .
there was a small paint chip in the tar ,
the top layer of which was lead @-@ based .
lead paint was banned in 1975 .
exactly .
now this particular pigment
was only purchased by municipalities between 1973 and 1977 .
when government buildings were required to either
paint over the lead paint or remove it completely .
well , so what ?
you think the abductor has got maura
in some abandoned government building ?
which narrows our locations down from thousands to ...
several hundred ? maybe ?
yeah .
i hope .
uh , did you get anything else from the sample ?
yeah , we &apos;re working on it .
what about you ? did you find anything ?
um , just a list of people that were in prison with lianne sampson
and paroled in the last year .
i &apos;m gonna go through &apos; em , see if i can find any connection .
do you think lianne sampson would be imprisoned
with the kind of people who would commit murder ?
probably not .
right , so that &apos;s a bit of a ...
bit of a stretch , yeah .
look ... i hope you don &apos;t mind if i say , but ...
you look awful .
thanks .
no , really , you look like ...
i mean , when &apos;s the last time you slept ?
i ... don &apos;t know . a @-@ a day or two ?
maybe you should have a nap .
n.a.s.a. pilots who slept for 40 minutes
increased their alertness by 54 % .
is that a fact ?
yeah .
well , you can take your fact and shove it up your ...
首席法医
don &apos;t worry , jane .
i &apos;ll take good care of her .
i came looking for you , and i found you asleep .
i was looking at lists .
i was , uh , i was looking for , um ...
it &apos;s okay to take a short nap , janie .
you &apos;ve been up for a long time .
you okay ?
no .
i &apos;m not .
what is all this ?
purchase orders and contracts for all the abandoned
government buildings in massachusetts .
turns out that the paint chip that kent found
was five different layers of paint .
so we have to look through all of this stuff and ...
figure out which building was painted in this order .
that &apos;s gonna take forever .
no , it &apos;s not .
now that we know it &apos;s not an inside job ,
we &apos;re a task force . we have all the assets we need .
detective rizzoli &apos;s in charge .
good to meet you .
talk to him .
okay .
wait . where you goin &apos; ?
gotta deliver warrants to
search the databases of all the cell phone towers in boston .
all right , so we have to figure out which one of these buildings
was painted in this order .
all right .
what &apos;d you find ?
i pulled the records for all the cell phones
that pinged off the tower near maura &apos;s abduction ,
just in case our perpetrator was carrying his own phone .
that was good thinking .
i got 25 names ,
one more interesting than the rest .
joe harris .
psychiatrist from m.c.i. framingham &apos;s women &apos;s prison .
he treated lianne .
frankie interviewed him during the murder investigation .
where is his phone now ?
pinging off a tower near the prison .
call the warden . tell her to find him ,
hold on to him till i get there .
already done .
send a full background to my phone .
and ...
done .
shit .
double shit .
hope ?
thanks for calling me back .
i , uh ...
i hate to have to tell you this over the phone ,
but something &apos;s happened ,
and i don &apos;t want you to hear it on the news .
yeah , yes .
yes , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s maura . she &apos;s been abducted .
we searched the prison and all the outlying areas .
he &apos;s not here .
i have someone pulling security video
to see what time he left .
i &apos;ll let you know as soon as we find out .
how long has he been here ?
two years . came from lauson prison upstate .
what do you think of him ?
it &apos;s hard to get a good therapist here .
they-- they make so much money in private practice .
but harris was solid . the women seemed to respect him .
he was compassionate , not a pushover .
i can &apos;t imagine he &apos;d have anything to do with this .
we &apos;ll see . could be his phone being nearby is just a coincidence .
i don &apos;t have a search warrant , so i can &apos;t look in there
without your permission .
of course .
go ahead .
thank you .
korsak , harris is definitely our guy . hang on .
i need everything that you have on him right now .
we gotta find this guy .
it &apos;s a little cold in here .
i &apos;m gonna bring you a blanket .
okay ?
let &apos;s get you up .
let &apos;s get you up .
okay , now ...
if it &apos;s money you want , i can get you money .
come on . if i wanted your money , i &apos;d already have it , right ?
then what is this about ? what do you want ?
first in your class in medical school .
first medical examiner
to head the new england medical organization .
peer reviewer for five medical journals .
you really expect me to believe
you don &apos;t know what this is about ? hmm ?
it &apos;s a good look for ya .
i don &apos;t know what this is about .
i know you studied psychology in school .
profile me . peer to peer . what do you think ?
dissociative personality disorder
with aberrant functional connectivity
in the default mode network ?
aah ! that &apos;s for biting me .
okay , say &quot; cheese . &quot;
i ...
love ...
isles .
i &apos;ve already put in a request
with joe harris &apos; cell phone company
for his home locator records ,
so we can track his recent movements .
okay , let me know if that &apos;s not happening fast enough .
once i get it , i &apos;ll start cross @-@ referencing his movements
with the list of abandoned government buildings
we got from the paint chip .
a lot of those are gonna be in urban areas ...
places that he &apos;d drive by on his normal commute .
i know , but i &apos;m hoping all this digging
will help us narrow it down .
also sent his picture to all law enforcement agencies
on the eastern seaboard , put a b.o.l.o. out on his car .
and korsak has assigned uniforms to sit on his apartment ,
his parents &apos; house , and the bar he likes on the south side .
have you found any evidence that this guy and i know each other ?
i suppose you could &apos;ve met at a restaurant .
professionally , i @-@ i haven &apos;t found anything .
maybe at the prison ?
is that list of prisoners that he &apos;s seen come in yet ?
they called 30 minutes ago , said it would be ready in an hour .
thank you .
for what , doing my job ?
yeah . and for ...
making sure i don &apos;t let anything slip through the cracks .
i &apos;m a little ...
frayed ?
you really should get some sleep .
i know .
you have no idea why this guy would go after you ?
no ... which i think would make sleeping difficult ,
so i &apos;m gonna get some coffee . you want anything ?
no .
you &apos;re very photogenic ,
which is unfortunate
because i need you to play a different part right now ,
not audition for &quot; cats . &quot;
&quot; cats &quot; closed a long time ago .
i never paid much attention to broadway .
i really don &apos;t wanna hit you again .
it seems unsporting , you being tied up and all .
then tell me what part i &apos;m supposed to be playing .
oh . here we go . perfect .
little fear , some pleading ,
just a hint of hope
that someone might actually save you .
jane rizzoli got under your skin .
no , she didn &apos;t .
you think that picture with a little blood on my lip
is gonna bother her .
that &apos;s the plan .
if you really wanted to get a rise out of her ,
why didn &apos;t you kidnap one of her sisters ?
because stealing you from right under her nose was more fun .
don &apos;t worry . it &apos;ll all be over soon .
you &apos;ll play the part of innocent victim .
jane rizzoli can play the ineffectual detective
as she watches you die .
i @-@ i @-@ i know i &apos;m not always the easiest person to be around .
it &apos;s the stress of the job .
i mean , it &apos;s just -- it &apos;s the focus i gotta give it .
i think people understand that .
i mean , my mom , yeah .
you know , she gives me a hard time sometimes ,
but that &apos;s ... it &apos;s just &apos; cause she worries about me .
worries about my brother .
hell , i worry about my brother .
he made a choice , right , to carry a badge ?
worry &apos;s just part of it .
you know , i just -- i never thought that -- that ...
that i was supposed to worry about them , you know ?
i never dreamed that somebody was gonna try to hurt me
by hurting them .
you understand what i &apos;m saying , eduardo ?
lo siento , detective . no hablo inglés .
i know .
¿ con permiso ?
yeah , yeah , go ahead . gracias .
any updates ?
yeah , i , uh , i sent that paint chip
off to the lab at m.i.t.
they have a machine that does raman spectroscopy .
still waiting on the results .
okay , great .
did you need something else ?
i guess i was just wondering
if there &apos;s anything i can do to help .
i &apos;m ... feeling a little bit impotent .
we &apos;ve eliminated 90 buildings so far
based on the 5 @-@ layer criteria that you gave us .
we have a lot of records to go through still ,
trying to narrow the list .
i @-@ i can help with that .
this is a public works building in newton .
jane , do you have a copy of kent &apos;s paint analysis
for him to use as reference ?
no need . i have a photographic memory .
you know , this reminds me of a class i did in edinburgh .
it was all about archaeology
we work in silence .
yeah , okey @-@ doke . we work in silence .
that &apos;s not silence .
we &apos;ve been digging into joe harris &apos; cell phone .
maybe he doesn &apos;t carry it all the time ,
but if he has been , it doesn &apos;t seem like
he &apos;s gone any further out of boston than the prison
over the last two weeks .
that doesn &apos;t fit
with how meticulously planned this all is .
but the phone has circled the area ...
of a former mental hospital -- the arkush asylum .
we didn &apos;t have records for that building .
yeah , harris doesn &apos;t live in the area .
no one from his list of contacts does either .
and he hasn &apos;t made a single credit card purchase
anywhere near there .
he has no reason to be there ?
not any that we can find .
scramble a tactical team . radio silence .
i don &apos;t want him to hurt maura if he hears us coming .
you stay .
got it .
i don &apos;t know .
i -- yes . i @-@ i @-@ i probably had my phone on me . i ...
no . no , i @-@ i definitely left it in my desk
when i came back from the prison .
are you sure they know i &apos;m involved ?
no . i would never tell them about you .
yes .
that &apos;s a good idea .
the tunnel .
yes .
and -- and i @-@ i need you to know that i &apos;m sorry .
okay ? i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m really , really sorry .
but i will fix it .
there &apos;s -- they will never find us .
yes , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll destroy it immediately , i promise .
i know . you , too .
well , you &apos;re wrong about your friend .
apparently , she cares a great deal that i have you .
you can end this .
just leave me here and make a run for it .
i don &apos;t like to leave things unfinished .
you &apos;re a therapist .
oh , did i give that away
with &quot; aberrant functional connectivity &quot; ?
how many times have you told your patients
that just because they make one mistake
doesn &apos;t mean they have to make two ?
hundreds of times , darling .
but i talk to prisoners . they rarely listen .
and when they do ?
small victories .
so this can be another small victory .
whoever that was on the phone
is not gonna take responsibility for this . you are .
yes , you &apos;re very persuasive , dr. isles .
i &apos;m sure that works for you a lot of the time .
now relax , darling .
clear .
this is the last room on this floor .
i &apos;m headed down a level .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what is that ?
you smell that ?
what is it ?
that &apos;s that -- that &apos;s that perfume that maura wears .
eau de ... something .
she was here .
yeah .
until reinforcements get here ,
let &apos;s stick to the major thoroughfares
except for this 2 @-@ lane road that leads out of here .
and we haven &apos;t found his car yet .
remind the guys to keep their eyes open for it .
will do .
we searched the whole building . there &apos;s no sign of them .
the hell made him leave ?
i don &apos;t know .
and i can &apos;t figure out his endgame either .
you think he would &apos;ve made contact ,
leave us some kind of message .
well , clearly he &apos;s got some kind of plan .
he &apos;s just not ready to put into motion yet .
korsak , is it possible that he knew we were coming ,
and that &apos;s why he moved her ?
so still an inside job , just not the way we thought ?
maybe , yeah . maybe somebody at the prison .
that seems more likely .
looks like he had her chained near the radiator ,
and then moved her to the chair .
yeah .
korsak .
t ... u ... n ... n-- tunnel .
i &apos;ll try to catch ward .
i &apos;ll have dispatch put roadblocks up in front of the tunnels .
they found his car in an indoor parking lot
about 3 miles from the asylum .
yeah , he must &apos;ve parked it and walked back
so we wouldn &apos;t see it here .
they &apos;re sending video from the parking lot .
i &apos;ll go through all the cars exiting ,
see if i can find him .
thanks , mrs. rizzoli .
hey , ma .
hi , jane . how are you ?
hey , i couldn &apos;t find anyone to talk to .
about what ?
oh , hi .
about what ?
eh , the test results that came back from m.i.t.
the paint was never exposed to any form of sunlight .
the oxidation of the layers were such
that it was most likely kept in a cold environment .
well , that would make sense .
maura was trying to tell us about a tunnel .
but not a tunnel that was exposed
to temperature variations .
our paint chip had never been exposed to high temperatures .
which means car tunnels are out .
those are like ovens in the summer .
yeah , we searched the entire asylum .
there aren &apos;t any tunnels here .
that &apos;s because according to the blueprints ,
arkush doesn &apos;t have tunnels .
sure , it does . i remember when jane was little ,
there was some kind of accident , a cave @-@ in ,
and a couple of the patients died .
all right , we &apos;ll search again .
holiday ,
send me something helpful , all right ?
these are the only blueprints i have .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have any other information .
don &apos;t let that stop you .
what can i do ?
call the public library .
uh , get a librarian to help with newspaper archives .
i &apos;m gonna figure out the date of this tunnel collapse .
okay , so all the entrances are sealed .
but according to this picture ,
there &apos;s an entrance somewhere near two utility pipes .
all right .
hey , i got it this way .
i got it .
so he used the shelving to hide the entrance .
this way .
ready ?
yeah .
ready ?
all right .
okay .
according to nina ,
there are two sets of tunnels , yeah ...
each leading to exits in other buildings .
the southernmost tunnel is the one that collapsed .
why don &apos;t you guys go together ?
i &apos;ll take the southern tunnel .
wait , frankie ...
janie , i got it .
be careful , detective .
you , too .
fresh .
maura !
oh , god . jane .
are you all right ?
the blood , it isn &apos;t mine .
do you know where he is ?
no . no , i @-@ i just -- i r @-@ ran .
i was hiding . i couldn &apos;t ...
couldn &apos;t figure out how to get out of here .
you go . i &apos;ll take her out of here .
jane , be careful . he &apos;s not working alone .
okay . can you walk ?
yeah .
you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re okay .
frankie !
god .
are you all right ?
no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m fine .
i fired off a shot .
he shot back and hit the wall , and this stuff fell on me .
and i ... knocked my head a bit .
yeah , he went off to the right .
i think i heard him go up some stairs .
okay .
i @-@ i @-@ i &apos;m fine . go !
‭ go .
仅供关押犯法病人
west annex roof , fire escape !
drop it !
call e.m.t.s now !
don &apos;t you move !
who are you working for , harris ?
who are you working for ? !
you don &apos;t even know me .
why me ?
why me ?
why not ?
hang on .
jane .
are you alright ?
how is she ?
surface abrasions , single facial hemotoma .
okay .
what she said . we are taking her to general for full workup .
okay .
did he hurt you ?
he just wants to scare me .
well , he &apos;s dead . okay ?
you don &apos;t have to worry about him anymore .
i heard him on the phone .
he wasn &apos;t working alone .
this isn &apos;t over .
it &apos;s over for now .
what did he want ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , okay ? he &apos;s dead .
you &apos;re safe .
okay ?
okay ... um ...
i &apos;ll come straight to the hospital as soon as i wrap up here .
okay .
be careful .
we need uniforms outside of her room 24 / 7 .
it &apos;s already taken care of .
did harris say anything ?
no .
so we don &apos;t know much more than yesterday .
no . just somebody out there
is really pissed off at me .
i wish that narrowed it down a little more than it does .
sorry .
i &apos;m an asshole .
hey , you wanna drive so you can feel in charge ?
no .
really ?
you &apos;re okay . you &apos;re okay .
