who are you ?
who are you ?
oh , you made it !
there , stop .
oh , my god . that &apos;s my mother .
this merge happened with my brother luke ,
and i won , so when i absorbed luke &apos;s magic ,
i must have gotten some of his qualities like empathy .
i think we both know i never really hated you .
i kissed stefan . i want to talk to him about it ,
but if it &apos;s bad , i feel like he won &apos;t be honest .
we &apos;ll talk when all of this is over .
we are here today to pay our respect
to sheriff elizabeth forbes .
you &apos;re talking about flipping the humanity switch .
i just need the pain to be gone .
if stefan had said the right thing earlier ,
would that have changed your mind ?
my mom is dead , elena .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do this .
that &apos;s not your choice to make .
hello !
i &apos;m empty .
fill , please .
i think you &apos;ve had enough .
look at my face .
this is me straining
to care less about what you think .
nope . i can &apos;t .
ok . i &apos;m gonna call you a cab .
here &apos;s the thing . my mom just died
as in i just put her dead , cancer @-@ riddled body into the ground
4 hours and 32 minutes ago .
i &apos;m so sorry for your loss .
oh , no , no , no . i don &apos;t care about that .
i &apos;m just saying that my feet
have been crammed in the world &apos;s most uncomfortable heels
for an entire day ,
and your tequila is the only thing that seems to be helping .
ok .
i &apos;ll grab you another drink .
thank you .
caroline forbes , the girl from the swimming hole .
liam . ha . the boy i totally forgot existed .
and i was just about to tell you how sexy you looked .
you are drunk .
slightly buzzed .
getting my ass whupped in shuffleboard upstairs .
oh , lucky you . i stood all day at my mom &apos;s funeral .
god , you &apos;re cute . are you a doctor yet ?
hang on . your mom just died ?
do you want to get out of here ?
i ...
what ? girlfriend ?
we all know you &apos;re not dating elena gilbert .
why would i be dating elena ?
you wouldn &apos;t ,
but even if you were ,
it wouldn &apos;t matter
because nothing matters ,
not ... a ... thing .
caroline ! what ...
it &apos;s like she never lived here .
how &apos;s her house ?
totally empty . caroline took everything
but the damn doors off the hinges .
so what ? she just flipped her humanity switch ,
came back to the dorm ,
and took all of her clothes
and thank you notes
and just left town ?
i mean , that makes no sense .
this coming from the girl who burned her house down .
do you think she &apos;s trying to cut off all ties to her past ?
i certainly don &apos;t think she &apos;s having a yard sale , elena .
ok . why are you getting mad at me ?
i &apos;m not the one who did this .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
ok . look . i &apos;m just gonna look around campus ,
maybe someone &apos;s seen her .
just let me know if you find anything , ok ?
all right . i will .
looks like you could use a friend .
oh , my god .
bonnie ?
h @-@ how are you--
alive ?
i think i &apos;d be used to this part by now .
i can &apos;t believe bonnie made it out .
actually , i can .
she &apos;s plucky .
do you need help ?
before you answer that ,
i &apos;d rather not .
i just keep experiencing these pangs of guilt watching you .
feelings are hard .
so &apos;s the end of this crowbar .
i &apos;m just saying .
digging up mommy &apos;s grave ?
that &apos;s dark , even for me ,
and totally unnecessary .
damon , bonnie saw her alive in a 1903 prison world .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s on camera .
you want to watch it again ?
my mother died of consumption in 1858 .
we did not go through the trouble
of moving this thing to the family crypt
only to find out that she &apos;s not even in here .
oh , so you just-- you just called me here
because you needed a friend ?
no . you wanted to know if it was possible
for her to exist in another prison world .
to which i responded , &quot; yes , &quot;
to which you responded with denial .
whatever or whoever &apos;s on that tape , it &apos;s not her .
then who is it ?
i don &apos;t know . a ghost ?
maybe she has an evil gemini twin .
nice .
if my mother was imprisoned in 1903,
she &apos;d be in her 70s .
not if she were like you .
i know my mother .
she &apos;s not a vampire .
she is not in a prison world .
she died of consumption in 1858 .
uh , if you &apos;re so sure of that ,
why haven &apos;t you opened the coffin yet ?
congratulations .
everything you know about your mom is wrong .
in the future , focus on my left side .
it &apos;s far more attractive .
oh , my god .
we &apos;ve met before .
yes . you saved my friend matt
with your blood .
oh , yes . uh , sarah , right ?
care to join me for a cup of tea ?
my best angle &apos;s up close and personal .
brave .
i like that .
my not flannel blouse ,
my not flannel t @-@ shirts , and--
i really missed my not flannel v @-@ neck .
suck it , 1994 .
so i bought this bottle of champagne
the same day that damon and i thought
we were gonna rescue you ,
but obviously , we didn &apos;t ,
so i couldn &apos;t drink it ,
so this is to you .
you were stuck there all by yourself
while we were back here ,
living our lives .
and this is the worst toast ever .
i &apos;m back home .
that &apos;s all that matters .
cheers .
ok .
can we talk about the fact that i drove
jeremy away to art school ?
so does that make you his muse ?
because eww .
do me a favor . don &apos;t tell him i &apos;m back yet .
wait . you--you haven &apos;t called him yet ?
i just--i want to give him a chance at normalcy
before we just drag him back into all of this , you know ?
yeah . no . i @-@ i do , too ,
but , bonnie , you should at least tell him that you &apos;re ok .
and i will . i &apos;ll tell him .
coming back to life is complicated .
trust me . i &apos;ve done it before .
besides , we have a roommate without her humanity
and in severe need of an intervention .
caroline .
um , you &apos;re here .
and you &apos;re perceptive .
uh , what are you doing ?
starting over . new everything !
new sheets , new clothes .
i even got us a new blow @-@ dryer .
oh , my god ! bonnie &apos;s back .
i thought you were trapped in 1994 .
i got out .
uh , we--we &apos;ve been worried about you , care .
you mean , you were worried about those around me ,
like if i killed them .
ok . funny story . you remember liam ?
elena dated this premed hottie
but then realized she still had feelings for damon ,
so she compelled him to forget that they ever had a thing .
what did you do to liam ?
i ate him ,
and he was delicious .
i mean , you know how cute guys just naturally taste better ?
you killed elena &apos;s ex ?
ok . can i tell my story , please ?
remind me why we &apos;re glad she &apos;s back again .
please tell me that liam is not dead .
fine . so i was feeding ,
and then that little voice inside my head that tells me to stop ,
he never piped up .
more , please .
well , this is awkward .
god .
you got blood on my necklace !
now i &apos;m gonna have to clean it .
what are you doing to me ?
well , i was going to drain of your blood ,
but now i &apos;m not really in the mood to drag
your corpse through the woods ,
definitely not in these heels .
i could throw you in a dumpster ,
but then everyone &apos;s always being found in dumpsters ,
and since i was the last person to be seen with you ,
i &apos;ll be questioned by the police ,
and what if one of them reminds me of my dead mother ?
what are you talking about ?
you , liam , just got complicated .
so you didn &apos;t kill him because it would be inconvenient ?
elena , i shut off my humanity .
i didn &apos;t turn into an idiot .
the last thing i want to do is give you a reason to ruin my life .
it &apos;s so weird .
it &apos;s like she &apos;s caroline ,
but she &apos;s not .
oh , bonnie , how we all just missed your commentary .
anyway , in return for my good behavior ,
i want a year where i don &apos;t have to feel pain or grief or remorse .
you &apos;re not gonna lock me in a cell and dry me out ,
and you &apos;re definitely not gonna try to trigger some latent emotion ,
hoping to snap my humanity back on .
so all you want is for us to leave you alone ,
and then you promise not to kill anyone ?
that &apos;s all i want .
now granted , if anyone tries anything to flip my switch back on--
and i mean anything--
i &apos;ll become your worst nightmare .
great !
i &apos;m gonna get a latte .
see you !
so st. caroline keeps her halo even with no humanity .
yeah , until she snaps and strangles somebody with it .
well , even if she does ...
could be good for her ,
you know , to blow off some steam , thin the herd .
getting awfully crowded around here .
damon , if she kills somebody , i--
not your fault , stefan .
by the time you figured out how you felt about her ,
it was too late .
she made her choice .
just do me a favor . check around mystic falls ,
see if anybody &apos;s missing .
will do , brother .
a little later .
yeah .
why tell your brother your mother &apos;s still alive ?
no , but i get it .
mom &apos;s in a prison world
and therefore an evil psychopath .
don &apos;t want to ruin little bro &apos;s perfect mommy memory .
i &apos;ll tell him as soon as i know the truth .
the truth .
which is why you &apos;re still here .
your sister sent me and elena back to 1994 .
you can send me back to 1903 .
technically , yes , i am able to do that ,
but i &apos;ll need the ascendant for the 1903 prison world .
as the newly elected president of the gemini freaks ,
i assume you know where to get it .
so get it .
it &apos;s my pleasure .
you want something .
shocker .
all right .
well , ever since you told me bonnie was back ,
i , uh , i can &apos;t stop thinking about her ,
all right , what i did , how she is .
it &apos;s annoying really .
look .
i need to see her .
i need to apologize ,
and you &apos;re gonna make that happen .
so that &apos;s it ? enzo ?
that &apos;s all i get ?
a name is a very personal thing , sarah .
see ? doesn &apos;t that feel good ?
i have pictures of you ,
your veins doing weird , nonhuman things .
they &apos;re all on this little card .
you went from cowering in a corner
to overt blackmail in the span of an hour .
impressive .
i know want to know more about you .
fair enough .
one ...
i &apos;m very fast .
two , i &apos;m very strong .
that was , like , 70 bucks .
3 , i &apos;m very rich .
rich , strong , fast ,
you have weird veins ,
you can heal people with your blood .
what are you ?
this is a joke , right ?
does it look like i &apos;m joking ?
you want to hear me say it . fine .
i &apos;m a vampire .
and ?
perhaps you didn &apos;t hear me .
i said i &apos;m a vampire .
you know , anne rice , dracula ,
that dreadful &quot; twilight &quot; series .
no . i know what they are .
i just thought there &apos;d be more to it .
it &apos;s ok . the whole vampire thing is over anyway .
caroline .
who is this nice girl we &apos;re divulging
all of our deepest , darkest secrets to ?
i &apos;m sarah .
sarah .
photographer sarah . stefan &apos;s--
darling ...
you need a drink from the bar .
it is so nice not to care what you &apos;re up to with that poor girl .
old me would have been in such a moral quandary right now .
old you ?
oh , you didn &apos;t .
i did right after my mom &apos;s funeral .
thanks for coming by the way .
kidding !
i don &apos;t really care about that either .
you &apos;re a laugh riot , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m actually a little bored ,
which is why i &apos;m recruiting cute boys
to come to whitmore &apos;s warehouse party tonight .
you like to dance , right ?
yeah , i love it .
see you there .
stefan . hey , man .
i &apos;m gonna ask you a couple questions ,
and i need you to be completely honest with me .
i can be completely honest with you .
good .
do you remember being around caroline last night ?
yeah .
kind of hard to forget .
what is that supposed to mean ?
we made out pretty hardcore .
was there any biting involved ?
i guess .
i mean , i @-@ i like to bite the lower lip a little bit , but
i @-@ i th--i think it &apos;s kind of weird you &apos;re asking me these questions .
no . i meant , did she bite you ?
not that i remember .
are--are you into her or something ?
because , like , i thought she was single .
i didn &apos;t know you two were , like , a--
she is . we &apos;re not .
great !
can i get out of here , please ,
because , like , i &apos;m late for this party ,
and you &apos;re really weirding me out .
what party ?
uh , warehouse party off campus .
caroline will be there
if you want to watch .
hey , stefan .
uh , listen .
i never thought i would ask this , but , um ...
do you want to go to a rave ?
ok . not exactly the welcome home party
i was planning for you .
i think we should split up and look for caroline .
maybe we should split up and look for caroline .
good idea .
good luck .
i &apos;m fine .
want to dance ?
i &apos;m actually looking for someone .
come on . this is a party . have fun !
down , boy .
just dancing .
look . i really have to go find my friend .
i can &apos;t help it . you &apos;re hot .
what the hell did you do ?
can &apos;t help it . i &apos;m hot .
did he have any bite marks on him ?
no , which means she must have given him her blood .
and he doesn &apos;t remember her feeding on him at all .
he remembers them making out in graphic detail ,
but that &apos;s about it .
so that means she &apos;s covering her tracks .
it &apos;s very thorough . it &apos;s actually really good .
no , it &apos;s not good .
it means that she &apos;s gonna use him as a human blood bag
every time she gets hungry .
or she &apos;ll drink from the blood bags in our fridge
that she just restocked .
wait a minute . why are you defending her ?
i &apos;m just saying she hasn &apos;t actually hurt anyone ,
and there &apos;s no bodies that have shown up at the med center ,
no students are missing .
what if she actually has this under control ?
you know , we give her a year , she &apos;s happy , and then--
and then what ? she magically flips on her humanity switch
and starts feeling everything that she &apos;s been putting off .
caroline is going to snap ,
and when it does , it &apos;s gonna be my fault
because i am the reason that she did this .
pain is the reason that she did this .
her mother died , her world was turning upside down .
she asked me one simple question .
all i had to do was tell her the truth ,
and i didn &apos;t .
now look me in the eye and tell me
that i couldn &apos;t have stopped this .
what &apos;s your plan ?
can &apos;t believe i &apos;m about to say this ,
but i &apos;m glad you called .
caroline go off the rails ?
if so , i called it .
gloating in one of my best friend &apos;s times of need ?
it &apos;s weird that i miss you .
bonnie , i thought i was clear .
our relationship only exists within the confines of 1994 .
you think one phone call makes us friends ?
you don &apos;t have to pretend , bon .
i &apos;m like a fever you can &apos;t shake .
yeah . yeah . a disease .
you ok ?
well , if scorching some douchebag
with my magic is ok , then , yeah , peachy .
when you came back ,
did you just slide right back into your old life ?
oh , you mean the one where my brother was an auto mechanic
and my girlfriend forgot she loved me ?
yep .
why , um , why did you call me ?
so ... teensy favor .
i don &apos;t know if you know this ,
but when kai merged with luke ,
he went through a metamorphosis .
he went from a sociopathic caterpillar
to a slightly less evil butterfly .
yeah . and anyone who believes that is an idiot .
please don &apos;t ever repeat that name to me again , ok ?
yeah . ok . heh . already forgot about it .
what was the favor ?
don &apos;t worry about it .
i &apos;ll figure it out on my own .
happy raving .
who was that ?
bonnie .
she doesn &apos;t want to do it .
doesn &apos;t believe there &apos;s a new you .
but there is a new me .
you--you explained it to her
so she would understand , right ?
small words , easy to digest .
not gonna happen . end of story .
shame ...
because mama salvatore &apos;s story is pretty fantastic .
what are you talking about ?
i have a strong lead on the ascendant .
i checked the gemini archives .
lily was captured on a dock
in new york city in 1903 .
what if she was on her way here for you ?
i mean , it makes sense .
she--she &apos;d just landed from europe ,
where ...
where what ?
spit it out .
sorry .
you &apos;re not gonna tell me , are you ?
no . sorry . my throat just got really sore .
i &apos;m gonna go find a lozenge .
maybe bonnie will change her mind
by the time i find one .
well , that &apos;s certainly a look .
don &apos;t be jealous .
you know , you should smile more .
you &apos;re hot .
oh , thank you .
and obviously you &apos;re here to babysit me ,
but i &apos;ve had less attractive babysitters .
granted , they were old women , and i was 8 .
i &apos;m not here to babysit you , caroline .
yes , you are .
you , elena , bonnie ,
you don &apos;t think that i can live
a normal , humanityless vampire existence
without killing anyone ,
and you feel guilty for being such a royal ass
at my mom &apos;s funeral .
you &apos;re right . i was ,
and then when i came to apologize
and tell you how i really felt ,
you were gone .
and now i don &apos;t care .
but i do ,
so let me tell you how i really feel .
i said i don &apos;t care .
i like you , caroline .
stop .
i don &apos;t know when it became more than friendship ,
but it did , and it scared me ,
so i @-@ i pushed it away ,
but here we are .
see ? that wasn &apos;t so hard , was it ?
only took a couple of years ,
cancer to devour my mom ,
me to flip my humanity off ,
but you finally spit it out .
that &apos;s good . anger .
that means you want to feel .
no , stefan . you know what ?
it just means that i &apos;m pissed , so leave me alone .
let it in .
it will hurt , and you &apos;ll want to die ,
but i will be here .
i will help you through this ,
but you have to give me a chance .
please .
come back .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
where have you been ?
the bathroom line was , like , a mile long .
i mean , look at all these crazy people here .
you are so boring .
no wonder elena didn &apos;t pick you .
honest truth . how good are you at surgery ?
i &apos;m a premed sophomore . i &apos;m terrible .
perfect ! come with me .
there you are . finally !
where &apos;s your date ?
what , you don &apos;t want to show her off in front of stefan ?
i &apos;m afraid she doesn &apos;t find me nearly as fascinating as i do .
but you have an accent .
anything you say is automatically fascinating .
i &apos;m afraid we found the exception .
told her i was a vampire ,
and her eyes glazed over literally .
pure and utter disinterest .
what &apos;s funny ?
stefan &apos;s been looking out for sarah
ever since she was a baby ,
which means he will protect her at any cost .
ok .
so what do you do when you want someone
to have nothing to do with vampires ?
compel them not to care about anything to do with vampires .
caroline forbes , you &apos;re a genius .
thank you .
now why don &apos;t i show you
some of my other talents ?
sorry , luv .
it &apos;s not as much fun when you &apos;re not really you .
what are you doing here ?
don &apos;t freak out , but--ahem .
just get this over with .
spit it out .
i wanted ...
to apologize ...
for anything i did ...
that hurt you .
bon ?
did you hear what i said ?
if i see your face again ,
i will melt it off .
i imagined that going a little differently .
bonnie , hey . it &apos;s me .
where &apos;d you go ? call me .
it worked .
it worked ?
you &apos;re caroline &apos;s emotional trigger ?
i saw it in her eyes . she &apos;s still in there .
we just have to go find her .
wait . she &apos;s gone ?
stefan , she made it very clear
that if we mess with her she &apos;s gonna retaliate .
then we find her , we lock her up ,
and i push until i break through .
i can get her back , elena .
ok .
ok . let &apos;s go find her .
what , you really think i want to hear from you right now ?
is someone having a bad night ?
what are you doing with enzo &apos;s phone ?
i stole it , but that &apos;s not the question
that you should be asking right now .
you should be asking &quot; why does enzo have
sarah salvatore &apos;s number in his phone , &quot;
or maybe &quot; where is sarah salvatore , &quot;
and ultimately , &quot; what the hell are you going to do to her , caroline ? &quot;
hello ? enzo ?
over here , luv .
um , actually , i &apos;m looking for--
enzo . yeah . i heard you .
he &apos;s not here right now , but i am .
caroline , what the hell are you doing with sarah ?
there ! an appropriate question .
thank you for asking .
as a matter of fact ,
i &apos;m going to kill her .
calm down .
it &apos;s just me . he &apos;s not here .
bonnie , this is about my mom .
kai knows a lot of stuff about my mom .
i don &apos;t care .
i told you i didn &apos;t want to see him again ,
and you did it anyway .
i know , but , bonnie--
was i unclear ?
he just wanted to talk .
now i want to talk .
so listen .
i get that he hurt you .
i said listen !
i want you to feel what i felt .
you were there
the first time he hurt me ,
an arrow through the stomach ,
but you weren &apos;t there for what happened next ,
when he chased me through the hospital ,
when he strangled me ,
he drugged me , he tied me up ,
and he stuck me in a trunk ,
and then suddenly , he wants to be nice , huh ,
start over .
bonnie .
sound familiar ?
he lied , and then he stabbed me again !
then came the worst part
because when it was all over
he left me
alone ...
and i wish i could share what that feels like ,
but i can &apos;t .
i want you to get out .
bonnie , i &apos;m sorry .
get out !
i &apos;m making margaritas .
you want one ?
where &apos;s sarah ?
i see stefan filled you in on his big secret .
where is she , caroline ?
not here . that would be stupid .
she &apos;s with liam . say hi !
hello ?
sarah is helping liam with his surgical skills .
please ! please don &apos;t hurt me !
i don &apos;t want to do this !
duh . you &apos;re probably gonna get expelled
and then found guilty of murder .
that &apos;s why i compelled you to do what i wanted .
no , please ! please !
look , caroline . i &apos;m sorry .
i shouldn &apos;t have pushed you .
obviously .
i was pretty clear about that .
look . i know that you can &apos;t feel it right now , care ,
but if you kill sarah ,
it &apos;s gonna haunt you forever .
trust me . i did it , and it sucks .
i compelled a student to perform surgery on stefan &apos;s niece ,
and you found a way to make this about you ?
god , you truly have a gift , elena .
look at me , caroline . what do you want me to do ?
you want me to leave town , i &apos;ll leave town .
i &apos;ll stay as far away from you as possible .
just please let her go .
that &apos;s the problem , stefan .
it doesn &apos;t really matter how far away you are .
you &apos;re still you--
kind , loyal ,
who with one look can convince me that i &apos;m not crazy .
that &apos;s the stefan that i fell for ,
and that &apos;s the stefan who can bring me back .
killing sarah isn &apos;t gonna change that .
i know .
that &apos;s why i &apos;d rather just change you .
let go of that part of you , stefan .
caroline , what are you talking about ?
if stefan wants to save sarah &apos;s life ,
all he has to do is shut his humanity off .
why are you both looking at me like that ?
do i need to repeat myself ?
he is not turning his humanity off .
elena , stefan unleashed himself from you months ago .
he can think for himself now .
it &apos;s not gonna happen , caroline .
hey , liam .
no ! please ! no , no !
cut out her spleen .
caroline !
relax .
she can live without a spleen .
you know , it &apos;s really the infection you should be worried about .
please don &apos;t hurt me !
no ! no ! no !
i &apos;m so sorry .
hey , liam . remember that conversation we had earlier
about being honest ?
where are you ?
don &apos;t answer him , liam .
whitmore medical .
please don &apos;t hurt me ! aah !
go ! get sarah out of there .
good luck getting there in time .
please , liam !
how &apos;s it going , liam ?
no , no !
i think i &apos;m gonna go into pediatrics .
you know what ? i changed my mind .
leave the spleen .
let &apos;s be a little bit more symbolic .
please no !
take out her heart .
liam , you still with me ?
i &apos;m not in the mood for the preamble .
just tell me why my mom &apos;s stuck in 1903 .
you &apos;re not bringing your mom back .
that &apos;s odd .
sounds like you just asked me to kill you .
you requested a truncated version ,
so i respectfully jumped to the end .
and why aren &apos;t we bringing her back ?
because there are only two prison worlds in existence ,
mine , created in 1994,
and the one created in 1903
for the sole purpose
of locking up your mom
and her closet full of crazy pants .
you said we &apos;d get her back !
i &apos;m telling you , as a semi @-@ sane person ,
you really don &apos;t want that .
and i &apos;m telling you as a vampire who eats people
you really don &apos;t want to piss me off !
i &apos;m trying to save your life .
tell me how to get her back !
your mom &apos;s a ripper , ok ?
she &apos;s a ripper .
she turned in 1858,
faked her death ,
went to europe , where she
went a little nuts .
no .
bodies piled up , she moved ,
killed some more until she had to move again .
they think 3,000 in total .
that &apos;s enough .
and for some reason , my coven made it their duty to stop her ,
so they cut her off at new york harbor
before she could tear through manhattan .
granted--heh-- by the time they got the ship ,
they found everybody dead .
it was so gruesome they had to burn it there at the harbor .
i said that &apos;s enough !
i guess i should show myself out .

hey , jeremy . it &apos;s bonnie .
it &apos;s a really long story , but i &apos;m back .

and surprise you ,
i don &apos;t know , show up as one of the models
in your drawing class or something .
listen , jer .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m still the same bonnie you want to be with .
that place changed me , and i don &apos;t know
if i &apos;m scared of myself or actually kind of like the new me .

and then i promise to come visit you .
i hope you &apos;re well .
