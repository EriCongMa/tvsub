oh , my stars .
is that how you cope with this insufferable humidity ?
i couldn &apos;t do it .
we had an agreement .
we did .
i told you if i ever found you in my territory again ,
i &apos;d kill you .
tell the boy not to pull on the brim of the hat .
what &apos;s in the box ?
i &apos;ve come to propose a business transaction .
no , we have no business .
the box .
typically , i steer clear of tin @-@ pot dictators
who employ boy soldiers ,
but i &apos;m afraid this situation is unique .
well , now you &apos;re being shortsighted .
tell him to put the gun down .
i &apos;m glad to know you &apos;re a man of decisive action .
you see , yaabari , you didn &apos;t actually find me .
i found you .
and while your prepubescent ruffians may not know it ,
they brought me here to strike a deal
that could benefit all of us .
what kind of deal ?
a man calling himself berlin
hired a bounty hunter to find me and my associates .
that bounty worked for you .
i &apos;ve since dispatched of him ,
but if berlin hired one bounty hunter ,
he hired five .
i want their names . i &apos;m willing to pay $ 3 million .
we do need to move quickly , though .
you have ...
30 seconds .
or what ?
or you give me the names for free .
we really should act swiftly .
we really should kill you and keep your money .
now , there &apos;s a point of view that i can relate to .
yaabari , look at me .
give me what i want , or so help me god ,
i &apos;ll make it rain fire on you .
kill him .
funny thing --
i recently acquired three hellfire missiles
at a considerable discount .
if you give me what i want ,
i can still call off the other two .
but i &apos;ll need to borrow your phone .
i know nothing .
i think you do , yaabari . i think you &apos;ve heard things .
who else has berlin hired to hunt me ?
the cuban . orci .
i &apos;ve dealt with orci . who else ?
i told you i don &apos;t know !
okay .
it &apos;s okay . there was someone .
i @-@ i can &apos;t remember his name .
they call him something --
the -- the prince , the lord .
lord baltimore .
fetch the water !
what are you doing ?
go , go !
he burned it ?
are you kidding me ? $ 3 million ?
we understand he has a lead .
reddington has had lots of &quot; leads &quot; in the past two months --
humint that was supposed to help us
in our search for this ...
we still don &apos;t even know what this berlin &apos;s real name is .
one thing we do know
is that the fbi has allowed its no.4 to hand out $ 12 million
in untraceable black @-@ bag cash to his friends .
that money was used for local intel ,
and i &apos;m confident that redding--
that money
has people on the intelligence committee asking questions .
the actions that concern you were approved by my predecessor .
now , i don &apos;t want to criticize harold cooper ,
and god knows i wish him a speedy recovery ,
but as interim director of this task force ,
i can assure you the situation is under control .
i am the deputy attorney general .
if i say i want to talk to reddington ,
i talk to reddington .
that &apos;s great , but we have a thing here --
reddington only talks with elizabeth keen .
♬ don &apos;t want no sugar in my coffee ♬
♬ it makes me mean , lord , it makes me mean ♬
♬ well , you can trace ♬
♬ lines in your face ♬
♬ but that &apos;s the way that your spirit makes you walk ♬
♬ though you hate ♬
♬ to see it gone ♬
♬ this old world &apos;s just put days on your floor ♬
♬ and all i &apos;ve seen ♬
♬ and all you &apos;ve done ♬

♬ all it means , we &apos;ll be sorry when you &apos;re gone ♬
did you take a different route ?
justice is freaking out .
change your hotel ?
hellfire missiles ?
seriously ?
life is far too important a thing
ever to talk seriously about .
martin won &apos;t protect the task force .
he doesn &apos;t care that berlin is still targeting us .
and without cooper to defend our actions --
people love to decry big brother --
the nsa ,
the government listening in on their most private lives ,
yet they all willingly go online and hand over
the most intimate details of those lives to big data .
most people don &apos;t care
that google knows their search history .
they know more than that .
they know your habits ,
the banks you use , the pills you pop ,
the men or women you sleep with .
every piece of information is worth something to somebody .
and in the hands of the wrong person ,
that could be deadly .
you have a lead .
lord baltimore is in town .
lord baltimore ?
he &apos;s a tracker by trade ,
but his methods are thoroughly modern .
he &apos;s made an art of combing through cyberspace ,
finding the status updates ,
financial records , and location blips
that virtually everyone leaves behind in the modern age .
and he has a new target ?
yes .
me .
follow this , lizzy .
it &apos;s our first lead .
if we find lord baltimore ,
he may very well point us to berlin .
berlin has hired a skip tracer
who calls himself lord baltimore .
two months , and reddington brings you a bounty hunter ?
he &apos;s more than a bounty hunter . he &apos;s a statistician .
even less impressive .
what does he do , find them with a slide ruler ?
no .
with data analytics .
you &apos;ve heard of this guy ?
yeah .
lord baltimore is an urban legend .
they say he roams the deep web ,
hunting those who don &apos;t wish to be found --
uses some sort of collection algorithms
to build a dossier based on
the information that people give away online .
he &apos;s a data miner .
aram , can you pull up that file you showed me ?
rowan mills .
she works as a data engineer at quancord analytics .
agent keen asked me to look for any irregularities
in the accounts of employees at the six big data firms .
i found several , but this was especially odd --
a $ 250,000 payment that went into mills &apos; i.r.a.
30 seconds later , it shot out to an offshore account .
yes , $ 250,000 was deposited into my i.r.a. ,
but as soon as i saw that ,
i changed my passwords and i reported it .
i &apos;m telling you , i &apos;m the victim here .
and you said this wasn &apos;t the first time you were targeted ?
there was an incident in august .
what kind of an incident ?
someone accessed my systems .
looking for what ?
bank accounts ? credit @-@ card numbers ?
it would be impossible to know what they were looking for
because the data we gather has no limits .
they were looking for someone who doesn &apos;t want to be found .
could the data that was taken help them do that ?
yes . that &apos;s what we do .
did you hear what she said ?
you &apos;re being paranoid .
how easy it is to track someone ?
i mean , i just feel like --
i don &apos;t know -- someone is watching me .
is that why you &apos;re living out of your trunk ?
those motels ? the aliases ?
you got to stop doing that , keen .
tom &apos;s dead .
you talk to dr. friedman yet ?
don &apos;t change the subject .
the visits are mandatory .
look , the bureau isn &apos;t interested in our mental health .
they &apos;ve assigned a shrink to talk to us
to cover their asses in case
one of us wigs out ,
but that ain &apos;t gonna be me .
you &apos;re too healthy to talk to a shrink ?
i talk to you all the time .
aren &apos;t you board certified ?
yeah .
and in my professional opinion ,
i think you need to talk to dr. friedman .
he here ?
lord baltimore has found reddington .
the extraction will take place tomorrow .
but the feds are involved now .
that complicates things .
there will be additional expenses .
what ?
i said no additional expenses .
you deliver reddington to me within 24 hours ,
or we take another bath .
you have one new message .
hello , rowan .
i know about that little chat you had today with the fbi .
so , i &apos;m going to make this real simple for you .
i &apos;m warning you , do not talk to them again .
i know where you live .
this person calls you by name .
i don &apos;t know .
it could be anyone .
it &apos;s as if they know you , though .
what about the apartment ?
any reason to believe there might be something missing ,
out of place ?
you think someone &apos;s been in here ?
hey , perfect timing .
i &apos;m gonna need you to trace a call .
okay . great .
but i have something .
our suspect , mills , she &apos;s telling the truth .
security at quancord analytics
confirm her terminal was hacked from the outside .
any idea what was taken ?
uh , yeah , like , a gajillion bytes of online data ,
which makes no sense .
why ?
because mr. reddington &apos;s a luddite --
no e @-@ mail , no computer ,
no digital communication of any kind .
i mean , dembe uses disposable flip phones for god &apos;s sakes .
why would berlin hire lord baltimore to track him ?
unless ...
you think they might be looking for one of us ?
not a day goes by where i don &apos;t think about agent malik .
me too .
what number do you need me to trace ?
rowan mills received a message last night .
i need a location .
fbi !
ressler .
let &apos;s get mills in here .
i want to see how she reacts to this .
what is this place ?
this way .
so , what aren &apos;t you telling us ?
nothing .
your name is on the lease .
we know you were using the screen handle lord baltimore .
who ?
the same data that was hacked from your work terminal
is on the laptop we found here .
you stealing data for berlin to find raymond reddington ?
i don &apos;t know any raymond reddington .
i have never set foot in this place before in my life .
hello , harold .
please apologize to charlene --
your side gate may need a new lock .
a get @-@ well present .
it looks so soft .
shea butter ?
is this what i think it is ?
when are you coming back to work ?
i &apos;m not .
things are at a tipping point , harold .
your replacement has the unfortunate distinction
of being both untrustworthy and incompetent .
i &apos;ve informed the bureau .
it &apos;s time to be with my family .
charlene &apos;s from the dominican .
i &apos;ve always promised we &apos;d spend more time there .
i hate sand .
if this is some kind of threat --
it &apos;s not a threat , harold . it &apos;s a bribe .
that is my only copy of our ...
little adventure in kuwait .
i &apos;m giving it to you
only to underscore the urgency of our situation .
i &apos;m not coming back .
you need to get back on your feet .
there &apos;s no shame in being a cripple .
i &apos;ll remember you to charlene .
i know what they found while you were at the hospital .
i know about the diagnosis .
let &apos;s get the job done .
i mean , you got to do better than that .
it &apos;s the only possible explanation .
and this nora ...
she died ?
in mosul , seven years ago .
but if what you &apos;re saying is true ,
if all of this is real ,
then it &apos;s the only explanation --
my twin sister is alive .
it &apos;s nice to have you back , mr. howe .
your rib eye is on its way to your room
along with a complimentary bottle of &apos; 82 margaux .
thank you , steven .
are you sure you want to take the stairs ?
doctor &apos;s orders . we &apos;ll be fine .
i don &apos;t remember him .
find out who he is and put two more men on detail downstairs .
you hear that ?
let &apos;s go ! take him to the roof .
lord baltimore .
aren &apos;t you a surprisingly saucy minx .
unbelievable .
i &apos;m sorry . who is it exactly that you think i am ?
you &apos;re mossad .
please don &apos;t tell me this is about that little dustup in haifa .
that &quot; dustup &quot; caimed the lives of two agents
and a turkish diplomat .
a diplomat ?
i had nothing to do with it .
then you have nothing to worry about .
oh , you have no idea how i wish that were true .
i have tens of thousands of things to worry about .
fortunately , you , my dear , are not one of them .
and why is that ?
because the person you just informed of my capture
is going to release me within the hour .
aren &apos;t we confident today ?
i &apos;m confident every day .
and i thought we had nothing in common .
i have no idea what that goes to .
it was found in your apartment .
i &apos;ve told you i &apos;ve never set foot in that place before .
let &apos;s talk about your sister .
now , this is rowan , and nora &apos;s on the left .
rowan was my first child by three minutes .
how could you tell them apart ?
rowan was a silly heart , always smiling .
she was a happy child .
and nora ?
she was complicated .
she was molested by our uncle rick
from the time we were 7 until about 12 or so .
i didn &apos;t believe her . nobody did .
everybody just went on like nothing happened ,
everybody but ...
nora .
nora had problems . she hated me , hated our mom .
she hated everybody .
after that , she was ... lost , didn &apos;t fit in .
i thought her getting that job with that company ,
that security firm ,
it really was the best thing she could do .
nora . ah , that girl , she was fearless .
first one in , last one out .
hell , if half the boys on my crew had a pair like her ,
well , you could crown me king and take the afternoon off .
she pressured you ? how ?
she wanted me to use my position at work
to try to get information on people
at a competing security firm --
stuff that she could use to get the upper hand .
and when you refused , she hit you ?
she flew out the next morning ,
and three weeks later , she was killed .
her team was tasked with
clearing hostiles out of a neighborhood in ad @-@ dawr .
lead truck got taken out by an i.e.d. ,
they came under heavy insurgent fire .
we lost all four operatives that day .
it says here her body was never recovered .
that &apos;s true . she was taken .
taken ?
well , they took her
and did god knows what with that girl .
so you never recovered her body ?
uh , i don &apos;t believe she &apos;s still alive .
but there is a chance she is .
but that &apos;s why you &apos;re releasing me ,
because you think she &apos;s still out there .
yes .
but what if she comes after me ?
what if she comes after our mother ?
rowan , we can &apos;t hold you .
we have no probable cause .
your younger brother , shahin ,
was killed in the 2009 pishin bombing .
in farsi , shahin means --
falcon .
how did you know ?
i know everything about the people
who are tasked with finding me .
your turn .
how did you do it ?
you possess an affinity for zegna ties .
so do millions of other men .
thousands , actually --
at least in the northeast corridor .
nonetheless , this sample was far too broad
to be of any practical use .
however , we couldn &apos;t help but notice
that you lean toward a darker , earth @-@ tone palate --
chocolate and oxblood ,
geometric shapes , rarely stripes .
we introduced a diblock copolymer nanoparticle marker
into the brown dye in their factory in novara ,
which supplies all the vendors on the eastern seaboard .
effectively turning every earth @-@ toned zegna tie
into a homing device .
brilliant . just like a bloodhound .
agent ressler .
sorry , dr. friedman ,
but we &apos;re in the middle of an investigation .
you do know i could suspend you pending assessment .
we identified the key you found in mills &apos; apartment .
the lab says it belongs to a van , a &apos; 77 g @-@ series van .
tell keen i went to pay the mother another visit .
agent ressler .
hey , i got something !
i got something .
okay , so , the collection algorithms that lord baltimore uses ?
yeah .
i applied them to the data he hacked ,
and , uh , i think i see how he does it .
it &apos;s amazing .
he &apos;s using personal details about his target &apos;s life
to create markers to narrow his search .
so he &apos;s looking for someone who lived in d.c. before 1990,
has a prescription for lipitor through medco ,
downloads world war ii documentaries on netflix --
not amazon --
and has a digital subscription
to both the wall street journal and cat fanatic .
reddington has a subscription to cat fanatic ?
no .
turns out lord baltimore &apos;s not looking for mr. reddington .
your suspect &apos;s been remanded into my custody .
this references a task force . what task force ?
it &apos;s a matter of national security .
perhaps next time .
keen wants you to take a look at these .
ms. navabi ...
jundallah claimed responsibility
for the bomb that killed your brother .
they had nothing to do with it .
i can give you the name of the man who did .
walid abu sitta .
disappeared from his hotel room in jiyeh last may .
police are baffled .
are they ?
what the hell is going on ?
martin said you were extracted by mossad .
we &apos;ll discuss it later .
what am i looking at ?
targets .
turns out berlin didn &apos;t contract lord baltimore to find you .
he &apos;s looking for a woman .
what woman ?
we &apos;re not sure . we only know her profile .
aram was able to narrow the search ,
but that still leaves us with over 200 potential targets .
naomi hyland .
who ?
w @-@ who is naomi hyland ?
you need to get a unit to her right now .
she &apos;s in protective custody .
wait . i don &apos;t understand .
uh , how do you know -- - listen , lizzy .
berlin is coming for this woman .
you have to move now .
why ?
who the hell is naomi hyland ?
she was my wife .
i never said that .
you said you don &apos;t believe in god .
if you don &apos;t believe in god ,
then you &apos;re an atheist .
you &apos;re an atheist .
well , you can be an atheist and believe in a higher power .
for me , that higher power is shopping .
yeah , my credit @-@ card bills prove that .
you know what i believe in ?
naomi .
i &apos;ll drink to that .
think we need more wine ?
yes , please .
honey , what was the name
of the lodge in the alleghenies ?
you remember , the one with the fireplace and the moose head ?
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry .
what are you talking about ?
u.s. marshals . everyone stay calm .
what is this ? what are you doing in my house ?
naomi !
mrs. hyland , i need you to come with me now .
we have a credible threat .
he &apos;s back , isn &apos;t he ?
hey , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s marcus .
you know why i &apos;m here .
don &apos;t come any closer .
i &apos;m not here to hurt you .
just relax .
i want you to hear this .

keen .
i just found nora mills &apos; body .
i don &apos;t know .
either rowan is the greatest liar in the world ,
or some kind of split happened .
give me a call back .
mrs. hyland , it &apos;s important we move quickly .
you think i &apos;m gonna run , just --
just walk away and -- and start over again ?
&apos;cause you and i both know that &apos;s where this is going .
mrs. hyland .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m not going anywhere .
who said anything about cops ?
it &apos;s fine .
well , it don &apos;t look fine .
i said it &apos;s fine .
hey , look at me . we &apos;ve been over this .
do your damn job .
move on my signal .
i had a life , you know ?
my daughter had a life
with a house and a ... dog .
and then i woke up one day ...
you can &apos;t imagine what it &apos;s like
to have a man like raymond reddington
turn your life upside down .
they accused me of being a part of it .
somehow , i was a suspect .
put my life under a @-@ a microscope --
every call , e @-@ every charge .
my assets were ...
i finally convinced them i was innocent .
they said i had to go , give up everything .
i remember it was a wednesday afternoon .
my daughter wasn &apos;t even out of school yet .
and by thursday ,
we were in philadelphia , fending for ourselves .
you need to talk to your wife .
you &apos;re gonna have to tell him .
we can be ready in 20 minutes .
okay , i &apos;ll let them know .
get down !
we &apos;ve got a gunfire .
i need backup !
what are you doing ? !
dembe , put him on .
i found lord baltimore .
hello ....
mrs. reddington .
where is she ?
i have already told you
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about !
you are lord baltimore .
you were paid by a man who calls himself berlin
to extract naomi hyland .
i need to know ! where was she taken ?
i &apos;m gonna ask you again -- naomi hyland ?
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re talking to me .
nora put this together .
a woman &apos;s life is in jeopardy here .
i need nora to tell me where she is .
then find her ! ask nora !
i am asking her !
you &apos;re the expert , but from where i sit ,
this is the perfect setup --
one personality hiding behind the other ,
able to commit a crime and yet have no memory of it .
well , that &apos;s not exactly how it works .
rowan passed the lie @-@ detector test .
that &apos;s because rowan &apos;s unaware of nora
and nora &apos;s unaware of rowan .
that &apos;s how dissociative identity disorder works .
the two can &apos;t conspire .
well , then we &apos;re screwed
because we have rowan and we need nora .
what we need to do is identify the trigger --
the image , sound , memory that flips her switch .
of course .
it &apos;s him .
you were at her apartment .
you &apos;re in her photos .
what are you , some kind of handler ?
i &apos;m nobody .
she runs everything .
with your help .
you &apos;re manipulating her .
you &apos;re looking at life in prison .
cooperate , and maybe we can make a deal .
tell me about her trigger .
you know ...
i think you were right .
i think nora survived that incident in mosul .
i think she escaped , came home , and killed rowan .
what ?
th @-@ that &apos;s impossible .
nora killed rowan because she envied her .
she wanted to become her .
she wanted to be the good sister ,
the sister who didn &apos;t get abused by her uncle .
you &apos;re lying .
nobody murdered rowan ! i &apos;m rowan !
no , rowan is dead .
you murdered your sister , didn &apos;t you , nora ?
that &apos;s what caused the split --
the trauma and guilt of the murder .
no , i -- i &apos;m rowan mills !

tell me where you took naomi hyland .
we got here too late .
describe the scene .
it &apos;s bloody .
lord baltimore &apos;s men , they &apos;re all dead ,
all but one , and i don &apos;t think he &apos;s --
let me speak with him .
what ? why ?
because he didn &apos;t survive .
he was left alive to deliver a message ,
and it won &apos;t be to you -- it &apos;s for me .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
the man with one hand ,
what did he instruct you to say ?
the bluejay ... on benning road .
n @-@ number 604 .
if you &apos;re looking for him , i can &apos;t help you .
you have to listen to me .
reddington -- i haven &apos;t -- i haven &apos;t seen him in 20 years .
i need you to ... lay down .
no , please .
please , i &apos;m begging you . i ...
i can &apos;t help you .
i don &apos;t want your help !
that &apos;s nice .
hold still .
you should let me go in first .
i talked to reddington .
he couldn &apos;t find her .
a win &apos;s a win .
lord baltimore &apos;s off the street .
did i hear right ?
was reddington detained by some , uh , mossad agent ?
yeah , apparently martin had to negotiate his release .
well , any agent who can track down reddington ,
i &apos;m buying them a beer .
congratulations .
i heard you captured the man you were after .
i thought maybe now we could
go over a couple things ,
maybe take stock .
agent ressler .
i will recommend you for suspension .
look , i don &apos;t mean to be a prick here ,
but i &apos;m not sure what you think you &apos;re gonna fix .
yeah , i &apos;m not sure either ...
until we talk .
about what ?
those agents who died today ?
about the fact that we lost a woman
that we were supposed to protect ?
how do i feel about that ?
i feel like crap .
but i know the good we do here ,
why it matters .
and am i worried that someday
it &apos;s not gonna be enough ? yeah .
and when that day comes , you &apos;ll be the first to know .
elizabeth ? the judge signed it .
may be of little solace ,
but he granted your application for the annulment .
as far as the district of columbia is concerned ,
you were never married to thomas keen .
it &apos;s none of my business ,
but i noticed you &apos;re keeping his name .
my husband ...
