winston &apos;s obsessed with walt .

okay , technically , they were misprints .
&quot; chica go bills . &quot;
let &apos;s go , guys-- these hats suck .
&quot; chica go bills &quot; is , uh , actually spanish
for &quot; young girl , go bills . &quot;
who &apos;s gonna mess with a guy who &apos;s wearing a hat
that says , &quot; young girl , go bills ? &quot;
i mean , the answer is everybody .
they will , they mess with you .
oh , my ... nick , please do not angry @-@ fix the sink .
i &apos;m not angry @-@ fixing ; i &apos;m fixing !
you want to know why i &apos;m messed up ?
why i don &apos;t trust people ?
why i have anger issues ?
oh , yes , i do want to know .
why i have the blood pressure of a hummingbird ?
do you think this is maybe about your dad ?
and so nickels comes
into my room screaming , &quot; daddy , daddy . &quot;
so i go , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
he says , &quot; daddy , i have a tick at the end of my tinkle . &quot;
oh , my god !
this is not a story for everyone .
and sure enough ,
there is a tick at the end of his little penis .
not a story for this moment .
that &apos;s how he got the nickname &quot; little penis . &quot;
oh , stop calling me that .
what are we gonna do with this guy ?
i have no idea , pop @-@ pop .
don &apos;t call him pop @-@ pop .
that &apos;s his nickname .
the nickname is longer than walt .
but that &apos;s the nickname that i gave him .
yeah , but it &apos;s really weird that you call my dad pop @-@ pop .
i like pop @-@ pop .
you don &apos;t get it . you don &apos;t get it .
yeah , fine , just don &apos;t call him pop @-@ pop , so ...
i think it &apos;s time for another drink .
what do you say , gorgeous ?
you want to give an old man a hand ?
sure .
i don &apos;t know , nick .
a lot of charm coming from this end of the booth .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what he does .
he lures you in
with his charm and his moustache and his perfect hair .
i feel like you need to talk to him about this .
right , &apos; cause i &apos;ll just tell him how i feel , and everything will be okay .
&apos;cause that &apos;s really the way the world works .
took the words right out of my mouth , little penis .
it &apos;s not a thing .
i love a good nickname .
not ... not gonna stick .
you know , when nick is not working here , the service is abysmal .
i mean , how many times did i have to repeat the words , &quot; lemon drop shot &quot; ?
yeah , i think he was making fun of you .
for what ?
working hard and playing hard ?
i guess the joke is on me .
another indian guy ?
my mom set me up .
oh , your mom .
that &apos;s cool .
have fun with your , your devs ...
and your ... and your an @-@ anujs ... or your deepaks .
whatever patel you &apos;re dating .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m not sweating it .
his name &apos;s pavun , pavun shetty .
what ?
as in , as in &quot; shetty solutions &quot; ?
i think so . why ?
they only nailed the crowd @-@ control logistics
of bombay &apos;s revamped open @-@ air market .
i thought you weren &apos;t sweating it .
i &apos;m not sweating it . sweating it .
killing me with that drop , dude .
you really seem to care about little nicky .
i mean , look at him .
he looks like hilary swank mixed with a sad , wet dog .
do you think he &apos;s really angry at me ?
i think you need to talk to him .
all i &apos;m looking for is a second chance .
you don &apos;t happen to believe in second chances , do you , blue eyes ?
actually , i , um ...
i &apos;m a bit of a sucker for second chances .
they &apos;re my first favorite kind of chance .
have you ever been to the racetrack ?
back at the tracks with my dad .
when nick was a kid , he would come to the track with me all the time .
and if i got in trouble , he would get me out of it .
he would get me out of it by doing the sugar ray .
oh , the sugar ray .
what &apos;s a sugar ray ?
it &apos;s when i pretend to be a diabetic kid so the man who is threatening
to beat up my father would run off scared .
you see , we did have some good times , didn &apos;t we ?
now , come on , let &apos;s make a bet .
here you go .
what &apos;s the catch ?
what catch ? there is no catch .
what possible catch can there be ?
all i want you to do is make a bet .
all right , pop , you want me to lose your money ?
i &apos;ll be happy to .
schmidt .
robby ?
robby , what are , what are you doing here , man ?
i &apos;m spying on cece .
cece .
you know , i &apos;m still in love with her , so ...
this is pretty much your basic broken @-@ hearted spying thing .
it &apos;s why i got this hat .
aw , come on , robby , you got to get over that .
wait a second , are you spying on cece , too ?
no . what ?
are you still in love with cece ?
no , that &apos;s still ...
yes , i am .
it &apos;s killing me .
me , too ! bring it in , man .
what are you two doing here ?
whoa , hey . cece ?
just nothing , we &apos;re just ...
yeah , you know .
do you think that she saw me ?
what ? of course she saw you .
do you think she saw me ?
well , yeah , you don &apos;t have a hat on .
nicky only had one dream when he was a kid--
to own a family horse .
that is so surprising &apos; cause it just doesn &apos;t seem like ...
nick hates living things ,
so , like , it just doesn &apos;t really seem
like in line with what i know about him .
all right , look ...
i want to buy a horse .
for me and nick to own together .
i found this beautiful horse .
gorgeous !
right .
me and you are gonna talk the guy down .
i don &apos;t know how to do that .
i &apos;ll take care of that .
okay .
hey @-@ ya , dusty .
aw , ya gotta be kidding me !
how &apos;d he find me ?
who was that ?
eh , don &apos;t worry about him .
what do you know about horses ?
i know they &apos;re big .
perfect .
this is a very sad case .
i mean ...
my niece , she goes to veterinary school .
we &apos;re all very proud of her .
top of my class .
so , what do you , uh , what do you think ?
terrible horse .
she &apos;s very sickly .
he . he ...
he . he ...
he .
i wish i had brought my stethoscope .
i &apos;m seeing a lot of split ends .
the mane is totally the wrong cut for the shape of his face .
so you &apos;re saying that this horse , right now , the way it is ,
will never race again ?
damn it , uncle buck !
this horse will never race again !
why did you fly me
all the way out from grenada
if you weren &apos;t gonna listen to me ?
yes , con !
okay , there are people in life who you want to be unpredictable .
your pothead neighbor , or vice president joe biden .
and then there are people who you don &apos;t want
to be unpredictable , like your dentist ,
or , i don &apos;t know , your father .
look , nick , my dad left when i was three .
every single day ,
rain or shine , he just never came back .
i wish he &apos;d been a little bit more
unpredictable ; that &apos;s all i &apos;m saying .
i hear you .
and yeah , sure , walt may owe me a couple hundred bucks ,
but it &apos;s not a big deal .
my dad owes you money ? how much ?
three , 400 ... like 1,100 bucks .
oh , my god , he &apos;s with jess .
he &apos;s gonna rip her off .
he &apos;s gonna rip her off .
i feel like cece &apos;s making a big mistake
with this indian guy .
she should be with somebody like us .
totally .
white guy power .
okay , um ...
cool guy power .
now you &apos;re talking , robby .
what are we gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i mean , one billion indian men is a daunting foe .
suddenly i feel sympathy for pakistan .
but it &apos;s like they say ,
&quot; how do you eat an elephant , robby ? &quot;
with chopsticks .
what ?
slowly , with chopsticks .
that &apos;s-- no-- with chopsticks ? !
in a taco .
what ?
elephant tacos .
elephant tacos ?
who eats elephant tacos ?
that &apos;s not even a saying .
one bite at a time , robby .
one bite at a time . yes .
one bite at a time . this is what i &apos;m thinking .
i use my superior powers of manipulation and persuasion
to get cece to take you back .
once we &apos;ve neutralized the sub @-@ continental threat ,
i smite you .
what ?
what ?
you said you &apos;re gonna smite me ?
smite-- defeat gloriously for cece &apos;s hand .
no , i know what it means .
but that &apos;s someday .
for now , let &apos;s scheme , my &quot; broheem . &quot;
okay ... i just want to reiterate
that i &apos;m not on board with the smiting .
whatever .
but i like the &quot; broheem &quot; thing a lot .
let &apos;s concentrate on the broheem part .
concentrate on ...
okay . and smite later .
cheers , broheem .
you got a great deal .
good luck , doc .
thanks .
dad !
hi , boys .
can i tell him ?
i would rather keep it a secret .
nick , your dream finally came true .
we got you a horse .
it &apos;s not my dream to own a horse .
what ?
did you use my friend to buy a horse ?
what ? no , i swore you wanted ... ?
will you excuse me ? i gotta take this call .
that is unbelievable , dad .
he had this whole thing-- he was gonna
name the horse &quot; a father &apos;s love &quot; &apos; cause you guys
always wanted to have a horse together .
tell me you didn &apos;t give him money .
actually , actually , that &apos;s a funny story
because i &apos;m actually an investor in ...
god !
god !
walid , drop dead !
damn , pop @-@ pop .
stop calling him pop @-@ pop !
now , listen ,
i already got people standing by to take the horse off our hands .
horse semen in dubai is gold .
no , you can &apos;t sell &quot; a father &apos;s love . &quot;
there &apos;s more to &quot; a father &apos;s love &quot; than just semen .
ew , poetic , but ew .
dad .
dusty , i see you
and we &apos;re doing this right now .
no , no , no , no ... !
dusty !
we got your back , pop @-@ pop .
damn , pop @-@ pop , man .
give me that .
okay , okay , okay !
father , we got your back , father .
five hundred dollars ?
you stole $ 500 from her to buy that horse ?
i didn &apos;t steal anything from her .
she saw the opportunity for a business investment ,
and she took advantage of it . i mean ...
dad , she will believe anything .
that &apos;s not true , nick .
my real name is jamil .
it is ?
no , my name is not jamil !
nick , that was not fair .
it is nick , you know that !
you told me in confidence .
how could you think my name was jamil ?
well , he &apos;s weird .
that &apos;s a good point .
just wait for one hour .
you see , i go meet the buyer ,
i sell them our horse for a huge profit ,
and because these suckers think our horse
is big brown &apos;s nephew , they &apos;ll overpay .
blue eyes gets her money back with interest .
sounds like a great plan . we &apos;ll come with you .
and i &apos;ll watch you give jess her money back .
yeah !
please , please , don &apos;t do this to me .
we &apos;re doing it .
no , no , you ...
you don &apos;t understand ,
you &apos;re not a sales guy , okay ?
he ... he starts to sweat .
nick only sweats if there &apos;s lying involved .
and there &apos;s not lying involved , is there ?
we &apos;re coming with , dad .
check this out .
we get seersucker suits ...
yeah .
and two more guys ,
and then we serenade her with a barbershop quartet .
well , if we got ten more guys and a plan ,
we &apos;d form an ocean &apos;s twelve .
i would be brad pitt ,
you &apos;d be the crafty asian fellow
who does the , uh , who does the flippies .
oh , i got a great idea .
we can name a star after her , all right ?
i know this web site , and we could put one
that &apos;s right near the robbies one through eight .
you have eight stars ?
there &apos;s like , a billion stars , they &apos;re really cheap .
but eight of them are yours ?
that &apos;s only going to go up in value .
it &apos;s a horrible investment .
i know she &apos;s into that gandhi crapola .
we could self @-@ immolate .
i feel like we &apos;re so close .
wait , robby . i got it .
cool ... guy ... power !
cool ... guy ... power !
cool guy power ! cool guy power !
cool--

it was for you to talk to him , and i just ...
some people , i just don &apos;t under ... they just-- aah !
and i understand why you want to break pipes now .
let &apos;s just drink a bunch and destroy the sink .
i don &apos;t need to break the pipes , jess ; i &apos;m fine .
i mean , truth be told , i was happy to see him .
i thought if you talked to him that maybe ...
no ... look , jess ...
people don &apos;t change .
if someone &apos;s broken , they just stay broken .
you &apos;re not broken .
i &apos;m a little broken .
no , no , no ... no .
oh , yeah .

but ... you &apos;re good .
well , look , there &apos;s a lot i don &apos;t tell you .
i haven &apos;t done laundry in five months .
i &apos;m not wearing underwear .

a big sock .
a very big sock .

what do you think about this ?
we get a three @-@ person canoe , okay ?
then we got to her house and we rap on the door .
she answers the door , she sees the three @-@ person canoe .
she realizes there &apos;s only two of us ,
and we say , &quot; ah , what a conundrum . please join us . &quot;
how about this one ? we get some night @-@ vision goggles .
all right , that &apos;s all i got .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know what else .
i mean , i would say trojan horse , but ...
in this economy ?
i mean , we could always go on a hunger strike .
we enlist in the navy , we quickly rise through the ranks ,
and then we can take her to the
naval officer &apos;s ball .
feel like we &apos;re right there !
