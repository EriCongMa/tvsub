can you help me pick an engagement ring ? i can &apos;t figure this out .
should i get her a tiffany cut or a princess cut or a .. ?
paper cut !
have you told anyone else ?
no , i don &apos;t want monica to find out .
you told me .
because i trust you and we &apos;re friends ...
and you saw me looking at ring brochures .
once again , not knocking pays off .
i wish you hadn &apos;t been on the toilet .
me too .
let me see . is there such a thing as a monica cut ? because that would be you best bet .
want to go to the coffeehouse ?
oh , all right .
we were just gonna see if you wanted to go .
well , we don &apos;t because we got the other place .
how rude .
sorry . want a bite ?
the one with the ring
so how are things going with paul ?
good .
although , you know , he &apos;s a private guy .
i wish i could get him to open up , share some feelings .
you just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won &apos;t open .
i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table ?
that &apos;s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone .
hello honey
watch this .
okay .
hey , paul .
hi , phoebe .
how are things going with you ?
can &apos;t complain .
hey !
hi .
great to .. -ross , good to see you too .
you take care .
what was the deal with you and chandler blowing us off before ?
that was so weird , huh ?
why did you do it ?
i didn &apos;t do it . it was chandler .
he &apos;s mad at you .
what ? why ?
oh , please . i think you know why .
i can &apos;t think of anything .
come on . you &apos;re a paleontologist . dig a little deeper .
is it because joey and i didn &apos;t invite him to that knicks game ?
is that something he &apos;d be mad at you for ?
i guess it could .
well , then i think that &apos;s it .
if he &apos;s angry , he shouldn &apos;t hide it . i wish he &apos;d just tell me the truth .
you should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table .
honey , i made a reservation at china garden . is that okay ?
yeah , that &apos;s great .
but first , talk to me . talk to me . tell me about your day .
it was fine .
okay .
what are you thinking right now ?
that you are looking really fine in that dress .
yeah , that &apos;s great , paul . but , you know ....
i want to know what .. wow , those are really great !
i just want to know ... what is behind this strong , silent exterior ?
they say that still waters run deep , and i want to swim in yours .
are you talking about having sex ?
no , paul.i don &apos;t know anything about you .
tell me about your childhood .
normal .
then how about puberty ? come on ! that &apos;s always a painful time .
your friends have a slumber party
and stick your hand in warm water ... while you sleep , so you pee in your sleeping bag .
no , that never happened to me .
you &apos;re lucky you never met that bitch , sharon majeski .
anyway ... the rest of your life . any regrets ?
nope .
i &apos;m not asking for a lot here .
just give me something . anything .
okay . -okay .
when i was 6 years old , i wanted a big wheel .
and instead , my parents got me this little ... plastic chicken that you hop around on .
it was embarrassing . kids made fun of me .
that was a tough year .
that &apos;s great ! see ? i already feel like i know you a little better .
okay , come on . now we can go eat . let &apos;s go !
it was horrible .
they called me &quot; chicken boy . &quot;
in fifth grade , i got in a fight . well , not really .
richard danville bit me on the nose and , and i feel down
i still have a little scar right here . you can see it.yeah , yeah . i see the scar .
i think this is really great that , you know , you &apos;ve shared your feelings.it &apos;s really ... it &apos;s beautiful .
but what do you say we go share some food ?
no , i couldn &apos;t eat now .
what are you talking about ? you love their kung pao chicken !
chicken ?
chicken boy !
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to do that .
nothing
this is the nine millionth ring store , and i can &apos;t find the perfect ring .
ugly ring , ugly ring , ugly ring ...
it &apos;s a beautiful selection .
so maybe you don &apos;t get her a ring .
maybe you do something different .
an engagement bracelet or an engagement tiara !
an engagement revolutionary war musket !
i &apos;m so glad i picked you to help me with this .
imagine getting down on one knee ...
and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry ?
i &apos;ll stick with the ring .
this one &apos;s nice . i like it .
sir ? kind sir , can i see this one ?
this is why you brought me . i know how to haggle .
let me handle this from here .
can i help you ?
i would like to see that ring .
or not . whatever .
this ring is from the 1920s.it &apos;s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires .
sir , could i ask you ... ?
could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you ?
okay . -okay .
will you marry me ?
oh , my god , that &apos;s it ! that &apos;s the ring !
how much is it ?
i will handle this .
how much is it ?
$ 8600 .
we will give you $ 10 .
are you interested in this ring ?
yes.but i can only pay $ 8000 .
okay . i can let it go for 8 .
we stand firm at $ 10 .
how would you like to pay ?
credit card .
oh , no ! i lent my credit card to joey .
i &apos;ll go get it . you guard the ring .
why did you give your credit card to joey ?
to buy some knicks tickets.then the jerk didn &apos;t even invite me to the game .
but i &apos;m over it . whatever !
listen , i &apos;m sorry about before .
do you have anything here for $ 10 ?
yes . i have these two rather beautiful ... five @-@ dollar bills .
i &apos;ll give you $ 1 for them .
remember how chandler and phoebe blew us off yesterday ?
no .
remember , you were eating pizza ?
yeah .
chandler &apos;s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that knicks game .
we were supposed to just get him one ?
that guy &apos;s always mooching off of us .
anyway , i still think we should try to patch things up .
we could get tickets to another game and invite him .
that &apos;s a great idea . and i still have his credit card .
here you go .
hey , hey . i got this one . here you go .
sometimes i just don &apos;t get chandler .
we do stuff all the time without you , and you don &apos;t get all upset .
all the time ?
all the time .
i &apos;m sorry , it was rejected .
that &apos;s impossible . let me see that .
this one &apos;s mine . here you go .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
still crying ?
like a little girl .
i know , i know . this is all my fault .
i wanted him to open up .
i didn &apos;t know that i was gonna unleash ... this weepy , clingy , moist monster !
i only know of two ways to shut a man up .
one of them is sex .
what &apos;s the other ?
don &apos;t know . never had to use it .
i &apos;m just saying , if we &apos;re having sex , he &apos;s not talking .
that &apos;s right . you &apos;re the talker .
anyway , great idea .
i gotta buy him some more tissues .
we have some here .
no , you don &apos;t !
okay . i &apos;d also like to try on the tiara .
oh , yeah . okay .
what do you think ? too much ?
a tad .
take the tiara back ...
and let me hold the musket again .
something &apos;s missing .
let me see the ring that my friend picked out .
where &apos;s the 1920s princess @-@ cut ring ?
i just sold it to that gentleman .
oh , my god !
wait , no !
let me out ! now !
rachel ?
no .
how are you , paul ?
okay .
chandler ... did your dad ever hug you ?
no . did he hug you ?
no ! no.it &apos;s just that my dad never did .
i miss my dad .
you can see my dad in vegas kissing other dads .
hey , chandler ?
yeah ?
would you ... ?
would you hug me ?
i &apos;m a little busy here , paul .
that &apos;s what my dad used to say .
okay . a quick one . come on , hug it out .
there you go .
okay .
five more seconds ..
okay !
joey !
what ? hey , what .. ?
hi . paul , is it ?
do you have my credit card ?
yeah . it &apos;s in my ...
in my pocket .
my back pocket !
thank god .
i got tickets to the knicks tonight .
i can &apos;t go.it &apos;ll be fun .
me , you , ross and paul , probably .
look , i don &apos;t have time for this , okay ? i gotta go .
that was mean .
yeah , i know .
get in here .
yeah .
chandler , i found the perfect ring .
i &apos;m gonna go with the one i picked first .
oh , wake up . the one you picked is gone . it &apos;s over !
what ?
some guy bought it .
i tried to stop him , but they put me in jail !
they put you in jail ?
the little jail between the doors !
i asked you to guard the ring !
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
but this ring is better . and monica never saw the other ring .
yeah , but when he proposed to me with the ring , i got goosebumps .
maybe it was the guy .
it was the ring !
was he excited about the tickets ?
no ! he blew us off !
what ?
i know .
i can &apos;t believe it .
can i tell you something ? i &apos;m a little mad at him now !
can i tell you something ?
me too !
he didn &apos;t want to talk to us about being angry .
maybe we don &apos;t talk to him at all !
freeze him out .
right !
i like it .
we &apos;ll show him .
from now on , it &apos;s gonna be joey and ross , best friends .
we &apos;ll be the new joey and chandler .
what ? you think you and chandler were closer than me and chandler ?
hey , don &apos;t get angry .
we turn on each other , he wins .
hi , i &apos;m back .
i &apos;ve written down more to tell you !
oh , that &apos;s great .
no , actually , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s great . that &apos;s really great .
you know , i gotta tell you , writing , all that writing , it gets me ...
it gets me kind of hot .
wait , wait . listen to this :
know what i wanted to be at that age ?
a lover ?
a surfer .
a surfer ?
i wanted to be one with the waves ..
hold on.let me just
get a little more comfortable here .
wait a second.this isn &apos;t too revealing , is it ?
no.whatever happened to that little dude ?
so full of dreams .
i don &apos;t care about the little dude !
i can &apos;t ! i cannot listen to any more of this !
the only one who &apos;d listen is a mental health professional !
that &apos;s only because they get $ 100 an hour !
do you know how much money i could have made listening to you ?
$ 2000 !
know when i figured that out ? while you were talking !
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re trying to stifle me
when 14 hours ago ... we figured out that &apos;s what my mother was trying to do !
i &apos;m sorry.i don &apos;t mean ... i didn &apos;t mean to stifle you .
this is all just a little overwhelming .
i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to overwhelm you.it &apos;s just that when those gates open ...
it &apos;s hard to close them .
but they are closed now . believe me .
i &apos;m so glad . i &apos;m so glad you shared .
and i &apos;m glad that you &apos;re done .
so what do you say we ....
i &apos;d like that .
that was so good !
i can &apos;t believe you talked me into this gumball @-@ machine @-@ looking ring .
it &apos;s not a gumball @-@ machine @-@ looking ring . it &apos;s a beautiful ring !
no , it &apos;s not .
when i looked at the other ring , i could see monica &apos;s face ...
and i could see her saying yes .
looking at this , i only see a ring .
unless i look at it really closely , and then i can see my own eye .
this is the most important thing i &apos;ll ever do . i want to make it perfect .
maybe we could get the other ring back .
i heard where the guy was gonna propose .
maybe we could get him to trade rings .
i can &apos;t do that .
you certainly can &apos;t give her that stupid gumball ring .
all right . where was he going ?
yeah , it &apos;s a restaurant ... the rainbow something .
rainbow room ?
rainbow grill ?
somewhere over the ... ?
l &apos;espace .
rainbow l &apos;espace ! no , just l &apos;espace .
i &apos;d love to know how you got from rainbow to l &apos;espace .
no , you wouldn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t wanna get in here .
there he is .
he hasn &apos;t proposed yet . she has no ring on .
wow , you &apos;re good ! after this , we should solve crimes .
okay . go get him.oh , okay .
excuse me . could you come with me ? you have a phone call .
who is it ?
it &apos;s your office .
do you know who at my office ?
john.oh , john ! great !
there he is .
hi . okay.there was a mix @-@ up at the store .
the ring you have was supposed to be held for me .
i &apos;m gonna need to have that back .
in exchange , i &apos;m willing to trade you this beautiful , more expensive ring .
wow , i would trade .
it is beautiful , but i &apos;m gonna use this one .
excuse me .
this is my fiancee , and her heart was set on that ring .
do you want to break her heart ?
yeah . do you want to break a dying woman &apos;s heart ?
you &apos;re dying ?
yeah , she &apos;s dying ... of a cough , apparently .
it &apos;s my dying wish to have that ring .
if i &apos;m not buried with it ... my spirit will wander the netherworld .
that &apos;s enough !
oh , i don &apos;t know .
let me see it .
great . okay , here .
all right , i &apos;ll do it .
thank you .
and you are about to marry a wonderful man .
hey , i &apos;m marrying a dead woman !
guys ?
i &apos;ve got something important to tell you.guys ?
guys ? guys ?
i &apos;m gonna ask monica to marry me .
i think we gotta end the freeze @-@ out .
wait . is this for real ?
yeah . check out the ring .
oh , my god !
so you two are really serious ?
yeah , pretty much .
you &apos;re gonna get married ?
we &apos;re gonna be brothers @-@ in @-@ law ! come here !
and we &apos;re gonna be friends again .
what ?
water under the bridge ! forget it !
okay .
i was gonna wait till it was official , \ r }
but i had to tell you guys.you &apos;re my best friends .
i can &apos;t believe this .
me too.i was planning on having a conversation with you about your intentions .
i think i &apos;m gonna cry .
oh ! no more crying !
i just dumped one crybaby . i &apos;ll dump you too .
i &apos;m gonna ask monica to marry me .
oh , my god ! oh , my god !
oh , chandler ! you guys are gonna be so happy !

where &apos;s all the tissues ? !
check out the ring .
oh , nice . one and a half carat , easy .
hey . -hey , phoebe.he &apos;s gonna ask monica to marry him .
i helped pick out the ring .
you told her before you told us ?
she walked in while i was looking at brochures . you can understand that .
guys ?
guys ?
god , that ring chandler picked out was so beautiful .
you should know . you &apos;ve bought like a billion of them .
humor based on my pain .
you know what &apos;s funny ?
of all of your wives , i &apos;m the only one who never got a ring .
this a big issue for you ?
no , but it would have been nice to have a little memento ... of our married time together .
something other than the divorce papers and the hangover .
ross is obviously not gonna get you a ring .
but ask for a musket . ask for a musket !
when we were married , do you know what i never got ?
sex .
well , yeah . no ring , no sex . big surprise .
