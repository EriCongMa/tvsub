i had a nanny for 5 years .
i loved her . my kids loved her .
i failed to do my due diligence , that &apos;s all .
i didn &apos;t know she was an illegal immigrant .
i also didn &apos;t know i would be running for this office .
mr. childs , 30 seconds .
with all due respect , that just doesn &apos;t wash .
you want my job--
a job that judges whether others have broken the law--
and you &apos;ve just spent the past five years breaking the law .
yes ! look at her negatives .
now , you can &apos;t just say &quot; oops ! my bad . &quot;
you broke the law , ma &apos;am .
they don &apos;t like wendy ,
but they don &apos;t like childs criticizing her .
mr. florrick , 30 seconds .
come on , come on . stick to the script .
the youth vote . the youth vote .
this is our last debate .
in six weeks you &apos;re going to be voting .
so i want to address the young people in our audience .
listening to us , lately , you might think politics
is all about shouting and finger @-@ pointing ,
but i want you to remember this ...
look , look , look .
you are the future .
come on . prison , prison !
your hopes , your dreams ... i know from my time in prison
that what we do here matters .
i &apos;m a mother first , an activist second .
what i did , i did for my daughters .
and i think it &apos;s hypocritical
for these two men to stand up here
and act as if they know the struggles of a working mom .
alicia florrick .
what &apos;re you worried about ? you &apos;re up by three votes .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m worried about . three votes .
this friday ?
that &apos;s the plan .
do you have the contracts ?
actually , i need alicia in my deposition .
it &apos;s all coming down .
tensions are high .
over ... ?
partners &apos; meeting . friday . look , i know it &apos;s last minute ,
but i need you in these depositions .
what is it ?
internet suit .
just dropped into our lap .
we &apos;re suing the search engine chumhum .
they don &apos;t want to go to court ,
so we &apos;re trying to scare them into a settlement .
just look angry and intense .
i can do that .
it was a thursday .
i had just come home , uh , from classes .
very late .
now , mr. shen yuan ,
when you &apos;ve discussed this in the past ...
excuse me ,
don &apos;t you want to hear the rest of his answer ?
oh , certainly .
please continue . would you like ... ?
um , i @-@ i teach at beijing hongwu university ...
sorry , i @-@ i taught @-@ taught at .
i was working on notes for a lecture .
it was 10 at night , and the phone rang .
it was a voice i didn &apos;t know .
he said , &quot; are you home ? &quot;
uh , i laughed .
i said , &quot; yes , of course . &quot;
and he hung up .
i thought it was a wrong number .
then i was saying good night to my wife .
and , um , i @-@ i remember ,
i @-@ i started to @-@ to say ,
&quot; do you think tolstoy died happy ? &quot;
but before i finished ,
the door broke open
and ten a @-@ agents
came in-- gong an bu--
g @-@ government agents .
they threw me on the floor ,
bound my feet , hands ,
and took me away in my nightclothes .
this was in 2004 .
i didn &apos;t see my wife again until last year .
i was , uh ,
imprisoned in beijing prison # 9,
accused of inciting subversion .
you see , i @-@ i had sent a @-@ a blog entry ,
and i had sent it to a friend here , in chicago .
and i had argued to him that democracy would come to china .
and how did you know that this was the reason for your arrest ?
how @-@ how did i know ?
yes . there &apos;s no record of your trial
or your arrest warrant .
how do you know that it wasn &apos;t someone just informing on you ?
because the security men who tortured me
for the next three weeks told me so .
and why do you blame chumhum for this , sir ?
why not the chinese authorities ?
i do ... i do blame the chinese authorities ,
but i used your social media web site .
i trusted my writings to remain anonymous .
but chumhum gave my ip address to the police .
it &apos;s the only reason why i was arrested ,
imprisoned and tortured for five years .
$ 28 million .
and an agreement to not turn over
any more names to the chinese authorities .
mmm ... no .
okay , then , what else do we have to talk about ?
your cookies ?
chumhum is a worldwide company ,
like yahoo , google , facebook .
we do business in canada , mexico , china ,
even ... easter island .
we have to follow the laws of each individual country .
that &apos;s your defense ?
that &apos;s part of our defense .
and , uh , human rights , they don &apos;t matter ?
uh , what human rights ?
one person &apos;s freedom fighter is another person &apos;s terrorist .
shen yuan , as sympathetic as he is ,
broke his country &apos;s laws .
we didn &apos;t make those laws .
in fact , if we hadn &apos;t handed over his ip address ,
we would &apos;ve been breaking their laws .
yeah . ask yahoo how well that defense worked .
yahoo never went to court .
yep . they paid up , instead .
now we &apos;re talking .
lower your ask .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
all right , then consider this .
chumhum could not have anticipated
the repercussions of our actions .
yeah , that &apos;s it .
the chinese just wanted his ip address
to throw him a little surprise party .
we &apos;ll be back .
oh , i have a pen .
do you want me to sign it ?
excuse me ?
your behind .
do you want me to sign it ?
they want to argue
that they didn &apos;t know handing over shen &apos;s ip address
would result in his arrest and torture .
so you need to dig through all of chumhum &apos;s writings ,
public statements ,
anything that contradicts that .
got it .
heading out for ... that ... divorce case
we were talking about .
do you need help with something else ?
we &apos;re fine . thanks .
we &apos;re like
homeless lawyers .
so , the vote is this friday .
bond ... is up by three votes .
one of them is supposedly me .
so , really he &apos;s only up by one .
by two .
no , by one .
he loses your vote , that &apos;s one vote . he &apos;s up by two .
no . i move to diane &apos;s side ,
so she gains one and he loses one .
wh @-@ what &apos;re you talking about ?
what i &apos;m talking about is i don &apos;t have time to ...
just agree we need more votes !
that &apos;s ridiculous !
we need more votes ,
and we &apos;re running out of time .
julius , where are we on turning fitzpatrick ?
still talking to him . nothing definite yet .
well , what have you been doing ?
what have i ... ? you know , in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,
i have a job .
yeah , excuse me .
this is not a smoking section .
this is a secret section .
walk away ! walk away !
we still have to talk about how all this
is going to shake out .
oh ... here we go .
yeah . here we go .
i want some assurances about the minority hiring program .
if he gets one more assurance , i swear to god ...
okay , okay !
you know , i &apos;m not sure ...
we &apos;re all going to benefit if we get bond out .
so can we just hold it together
for one more week , please ? !
but no more meetings outside .
i walk away from this vent smelling like spaghetti .
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s not exactly the continental congress ,
but all we need to do is switch one vote .
or ... add two .
remember when our firms were brought together , under stern ?
you &apos;re not thinking about bringing stern back , are you ?
ecause i &apos;d really rather ...
no , his gang of three . remember ?
the alter kockers ?
yes .
we needed to keep them on the rolls per stern &apos;s contract .
they didn &apos;t have to come in to work ,
but we sent them the quarterly reports , and ...
they &apos;re still equity partners .
they &apos;re dead , aren &apos;t they ? they have to be dead .
one of them is dead . two of them ...
aren &apos;t .
every statement made by every board member of chumhum ,
and not a single one mentions china .
what &apos;s this ?
change of address .
for who ?
me .
uh , i don &apos;t ... think i even have your old address .
well , now you have my new one .
i feel like we &apos;ve grown closer together .
okay , give it back .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
this is going in my copy of eat , pray , love .
sorry .
peter did well in his debate today .
yeah , i know . do you want him to win ?
yes .
i just don &apos;t want to go back to the way things were .
well , why would they ?
i don &apos;t know . life .
zach . i just got dad &apos;s text . everything good ?
yeah .
i &apos;m going to be another hour .
yeah , i &apos;ll tell him .
i love you .
all right , love you , too .
wendy &apos;s not out . she &apos;s hurt .
but she &apos;s not out .
oh , come on !
i don &apos;t want to hear anything discouraging !
you slaughtered them !
okay , but ...
no &quot; buts &quot; ! give us a minute to feel good about this , huh ?
no , no , no , no . wait .
i @-@ i want to hear this . go ahead .
well , women sympathize with her , with wendy .
over nannygate .
i thought so . and she gave a good closing .
it &apos;s a very good closing .
i don &apos;t think we killed her .
i think she stays in the race .
well , let her . she &apos;s injured . she &apos;ll limp along .
what about childs ? you find out anything about his nanny ?
yeah . swedish au pair .
all paid up . everything legal .
but , hey ! we &apos;re back from the grave .
we have money coming in ,
we &apos;ll start buying air time .
with six weeks left ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t think so .
we needed to make this a two @-@ man race , and we didn &apos;t .
but it was a good day .
it was .
and a good race . gentlemen ...
thank you .
it was an honor serving with you .
hi , becca ? yeah . i was just ... wondering ,
do you still have those photos from drama camp ?
no , it &apos;s important .
neil gross . i &apos;m ceo of chumhum .
so you &apos;re the reason
shen yuan was imprisoned and tortured ?
no . you &apos;ll have to subpoena the chinese authorities for that .
but you supplied the chinese authorities
with mr. yuan &apos;s ip address .
yes , which we were forced to do .
if the u.s. government forced us
to supply the ip addresses of a child pornographer ,
we would do the same .
wait , so you &apos;re equating a chinese dissident
with a child pornographer ?
no .
i don &apos;t think any fair analysis of our exchange
would conclude that , but ... nice try .
isn &apos;t the motto of your company &quot; first , do no wrong &quot; ?
yes , it is .
do you believe you &quot; did no wrong &quot;
when you turned mr. yuan &apos;s information over to the chinese ?
i believe &quot; wrong &quot; is best avoided by being open .
&quot; information wants to be free . &quot;
so to speak .
information wants to be free ,
but people want to go to jail ?
we had no foreknowledge of what the chinese would do
with the supplied ip addresses .
how old are you ?
me , why ?
because i &apos;m asking you a question in a deposition .
oh . i &apos;m 50 . how old are you ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little old to be wearing a hoodie ?
is there any point to this line of questioning ,
other than to offend ?
not really , actually .
it &apos;s okay , vi . it &apos;s all good .
i think hoodies are practical .
i think they help brand a lifestyle .
and i think i make more in an hour than you make in a year .
that help you ?
yes , it does , actually .
how many ip addresses of dissidents
have you supplied to the chinese authorities ?
i don &apos;t know . not more than 50 .
not more than 50 ?
i ...
i think that number ... surprised someone
who was in prison and tortured for five years .
look , i don &apos;t think you understand .
if the u.s. government thinks
we should not be doing business in china ,
then they have one simple remedy : outlaw it .
like they do in cuba , but they don &apos;t do that .
and you know why ?
i think i know what you &apos;ll argue .
because american businesses in china help open the door .
just a little bit .
we ... let the light in .
it also doesn &apos;t hurt that we owe them $ 843 billion , does it ?
guess i &apos;m a lot less cynical than you ,
because i think we &apos;re changing the face of chinese society .
look what happened in egypt .
what ?
you attended stanford university , is that correct ?
yes , i did .
i wore a hoodie there , too .
in your comparative religions class in 1984,
did you write a paper about
the arrest and torture of tibetan activists ?
are you all right ?
the guard who took the most pleasure
in my water ... treatment--
it is simulated drowning--
he had a cell phone in his pocket .
and it would ring , and he would stop .
it &apos;s the same ring .
i hear it everywhere .
sorry . when @-@ whenever i hear it ,
i think of that .
it &apos;s an odd way to walk through life .
my worry is they will offer money ,
and not stop this practice .
$ 865,000 .
really ? your ceo makes more in an hour than i make in a year ,
and he wants to offer ...
direct damages .
lost wages . the wife &apos;s loss of companionship .
adjusted for inflation .
our legal department looked into it ;
found no reason for punitive .
no pain and suffering ?
not that would warrant more than $ 865,000 .
what do you have ?
what do you think i have ?
so , what ?
&quot; lack of foreknowledge &quot; didn &apos;t work for you ,
so now you &apos;re gonna go after shen yuan ?
why not nelson mandela ? vaclav havel ?
瓦茨拉夫 · 哈韦尔 : 捷克民主人士
see you tomorrow .
a bluff ? or what ?
you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m not .
zach looks exactly like his dad .
zach ! there you are .
jackie and i were just having a little chat .
hi .
well , i &apos;ll let you two get to it .
i &apos;m really glad we got to talk , jackie .
what are you doing with my grandmother ?
nothing , she was already here .
she &apos;s actually pretty cool .
cool skips a generation , didn &apos;t you know that ?
no . it doesn &apos;t .
so these are the pictures of glenn , jr. at drama camp .
what &apos;re you looking for ?
my dad &apos;s trying to prove
that glenn childs never paid his nanny .
they said it was a swedish au pair .
but i thought i saw in your pictures ...
wait . stop .
if that &apos;s his nanny , she &apos;s not swedish .
we think they &apos;ll try to show shen yuan wasn &apos;t tortured .
really , any idea how ?
well , my guess is
they &apos;ll get a chinese official on their witness list
to insist there was no torture .
so we need to line up dissidents to refute it .
well , okay . i &apos;ll be out of contact for an hour ,
so keep me in touch .
sorry about that .
no , take your time .
yeah .
we don &apos;t mind sitting here , waiting .
well , as i was saying , we want you back .
back for the next equity partner meeting .
what do we get ?
well , office space . and a seat at the table .
and year @-@ end bonuses ?
what , next @-@ year bonuses ?
no , no , no . this year .
i said &quot; ice cream , &quot; you stupid bitch .
how many times do i have to say it ?
um , would ...
you want year @-@ end bonuses for a year that you didn &apos;t work ?
you &apos;re paying for our wisdom .
you want our votes , right ?
you want both our votes ?
yes .
then we have terms .
cary .
what are you doing here ?
so a change of address notice , huh ?
why is that seen as such a revelation ?
hey , i &apos;m just saying i have one .
i moved .
good for you .
cary ...
what ?
i like you , it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s just , you know ...
i &apos;m not here for anything other than to tell you something .
a grand jury is being impaneled , looking into you .
specifically into me ?
well ... supposedly it &apos;s about corrupt practices
by defense investigators , but , yeah ...
childs is focusing in on you ; readying an indictment .
when ?
it &apos;s next week .
we &apos;re lining up witnesses and exhibits .
can you tell me who ?
no .
i shouldn &apos;t be telling you this much .
cary .
why did you send me a change of address notice , anyway ?
i don &apos;t know . it just ...
it just felt normal .
you &apos;re trying to be normal ?
sure . i like normal .
welcome back to normal .
florrick for state &apos;s attorney .
how may i direct your call ?
well , look who we have here today .
ah ! hello , mr. gold .
i come in peace .
mm @-@ hmm . like yasser arafat ?
are you maybe confusing my office
with the free clinic down the street ?
zach ! look ! i found him .
eli . how &apos;re you doing ?
we have something to show you .
zach has something to show you .
you said that childs paid the swedish nanny in full .
if that &apos;s the case , then who &apos;s this ?
she &apos;s not swedish . i mean , look at her , she &apos;s black .
and becca saw her bring childs &apos; son to drama camp .
do you see ?
i see . thank you .
then why are you not ...
i mean , this is good , right ?
you need to , like ...
i need to what ?
i don &apos;t know . look into it ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
what &apos;s wrong is that eli doesn &apos;t trust me .
no . this is ... interesting .
see ?
i &apos;m interested .
could you just give me one moment ?
look , i &apos;m going to tell my dad .
is there any way you have of finding out this nanny &apos;s name ?
maybe .
then that would be helpful .
great . we &apos;re on it .
thanks .
i am the smartest person i know .
no , you can &apos;t have a corner office !
because there are no corner offices left !
the alter kockers ?
they &apos;re killing me .
deposition .
no !
i got to go .
then get out your rolodex !
see what other firm will hire you !
what do we have ?
amnesty international , and two dissidents .
from the same prison ?
the exact same prison .
excuse me . if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to add a new witness to the witness list .
to testify shen yuan wasn &apos;t tortured ?
among other things .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find it illuminating .
i &apos;m sure i will , too .
and we &apos;ll spend the afternoon subpoenaing
and cross @-@ examining dueling experts .
jinghua .
who &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s ... my wife .
okay . it &apos;s just the two of us .
no one &apos;s listening .
what should i be made aware of ?
you think will is on your side ,
that he &apos;s going to vote to get rid of diane .
but ... he &apos;s playing you .
he &apos;s actually on diane &apos;s side .
i don &apos;t believe you .
then don &apos;t . i just met with them all yesterday .
will , diane , and ...
david lee .
they &apos;re going to try to flip fitzpatrick
to vote with them .
why are you telling me this ?
what do you want ?
i &apos;ll vote with you .
but i want two things .
david lee-- out .
and head of litigation .
moss is doing a superior job .
i &apos;ll do a better one .
she left me after i was out of prison .
it happens to some people after things like this .
we came to america a year ago ,
and my wife left me .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s ... testifying against you ,
saying you weren &apos;t tortured , because ... ?
she wants to hurt me .
okay , thanks .
can you give us a minute ?
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
kalinda , get everything you can on the wife .
we need to show her testimony was a lie .
are you going home ?
what ?
becca , how far do you think i trust you ?
not far .
what do you want ?
you know what i want .
thought you were into this florrick kid .
hey , i like politician kids . what can i say ?
i need one more to complete my political ...
education .
this is glenn childs . speak .
dad , it &apos;s me .
hey , son , what &apos;s up ?
something &apos;s weird here .
this girl i know from school--
the one with peter florrick &apos;s kid ?
yeah ?
she was asking about rita .
from a few years ago .
remember ? rita from that summer .
yeah , i @-@ i remember . rita .
she wanted to know her name .
she said her parents wanted to hire her .
did you give it to her ?
no . never .
good . thanks .
let me call someone . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
we &apos;re negotiating .
they &apos;re offering too little , and we &apos;re asking ...
hold on .
mr. lyman ?
i understand . mr ...
can i call you back ?
mr. lyman . ah .
good to see you .
we need to talk .
of course , we do . let &apos;s go . yeah ...
where are we going ?
over here ...
julius ?
what ?
what is that about ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll find out .
it &apos;s freezing here .
mr. lyman , i thought i said we would talk on the phone .
you &apos;ve got a problem . it &apos;s merrick .
i can &apos;t give any more . we made a deal .
you both agreed .
it &apos;s not me . it &apos;s merrick .
he &apos;s dead .
he was very nervous .
he was going through his rolodex .
the whole thing was too much for him .
so here &apos;s the thing .
i &apos;m still on board ,
but i want everything that you promised him .
quite the humanitarian .
hey , i didn &apos;t kill him .
so we &apos;re still down on votes ?
no , we &apos;re tied .
with this , bond has exactly 22 equity partners .
we have exactly 22 .
either way , i still get my corner office , right ?
yeah ? kalinda , yeah . what &apos;s going on ?
what ?
we found out why shen yuan &apos;s wife walked out on him .
he was cheating .
he joined a free tibet movement when he moved to the states ,
and he met a young activist a few months ago .
oh , dear god .
his wife found out about it , and she walked out on him .
no matter where you go , you run into it .
we still think you can use it to undercut the wife &apos;s testimony .
it &apos;s irrelevant to pain and suffering .
yeah , but we don &apos;t have nelson mandela anymore .
after years of imprisonment and torture ,
he hops into the first young bed ?
maybe we can settle for cash .
a few million ?
no . we need to get chumhum to stop these practices in china .
that was the original goal of the suit .
let me talk to him .
he could ... speak to his wife ?
reunite with her ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
she &apos;s lying about him being tortured .
maybe he can convince her to recant .
okay . good . mm .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s nothing to do with this .
you want chumhum to stop handing over
dissident names to china ?
your wife-- you have to get her to recant her testimony .
she &apos;s ... angry .
she &apos;s been hurt .
i ... i &apos;ll talk to her .
you represented him , right ?
patric edelstein ?
yeah .
he was suing that movie .
i think i saw him today at work .
no , he &apos;s in burlingame .
see ? oh , no , you &apos;re right ,
actually . this is his log of public tweets .
it says he &apos;s in chicago till monday .
he &apos;s cool .
he &apos;s , like , the fifth richest guy in the world .
does he have any business in china ?
his search engine ?
no , i don &apos;t think so . he &apos;s trying , though . see ?
he just met with the head of hongzheren .
what &apos;s wrong ?
thank you .
this is about patric edelstein .
patric edelstein , the billionaire ?
the one we represented
in his case against the movie about his life ?
we &apos;re still representing him ?
his midwestern concerns , yes .
but this china suit--
we &apos;re doing it for edelstein ?
he wants chumhum out of china
so he can move in and monopolize it .
i don &apos;t know .
but you do .
it &apos;s a good case , no matter what .
shen yuan was tortured , imprisoned .
yes , but that &apos;s not why we &apos;re pursuing it .
alicia ...
i just
for one minute wanted to think
that we were doing the right thing .
but we are doing the right thing .
but for the wrong reason .
who do you know is doing something for the right reason ?
i would love to meet them ,
because my guess is , after five minutes of questioning ,
we &apos;ll find the wrong reason .
you believe that ?
i do believe that .
and if you thought about all you &apos;ve learned this last year ,
you &apos;d believe it , too .
edelstein moves into china , what does he do ?
what do you mean ?
does he turn over the names of more dissidents ?
it &apos;s the law .
what fresh hell today ?
we thought having two more votes would get us over the top ,
so we approached two of the senior citizens
who were still on the logs as equity partners .
okay , david . we get it . we get it .
no , i don &apos;t think you do .
you couldn &apos;t have scripted it better .
so what happened ? did one of them die ?
yesterday .
all you need are jugglers , and we &apos;ll have a roman farce .
no smoking ! go away !
anyway , i &apos;m glad mr. lee finds this so entertaining .
that just puts more pressure on you , julius ,
to turn fitzpatrick .
can you do it ?
all i can do is try .
oh , yes , please , do try .
so they think they &apos;re tied ?
yes . with one of stern &apos;s gang of three .
the other two died .
but your vote puts me over the top ?
yes . if ...
i know .
head of litigation .
congratulations .
you &apos;re our new head of litigation .
okay . thank you , ma &apos;am .
ooh , that sounded good .
childs had another nanny .
for his grown kids .
a jamaican nanny .
a ... i thought you said she was swedish .
she was , but she had to go back to sweden to--
i don &apos;t know-- swim in a fjord or something .
that &apos;s norway .
thank you .
so childs needed another nanny
for three months over the summer ,
and he hired a jamaican nanny illegally .
i &apos;ll have to do polling .
wait . there &apos;s more .
i wanted to seal the deal this time .
so i had someone hint to childs
that we were pursuing the illegal nanny &apos;s identity ,
and he took the bait , and led us right to her .
childs tried to cover it up .
you &apos;re kidding ?
no . he tried to pay for the jamaican nanny to leave the country .
you have it all ?
documented and certified .
do the polling .
i &apos;ll do the polling .
oh , well , this is turning into tit for tat , isn &apos;t it ?
yup , and tat &apos;s up by one .
ah , it was sweet of shen yuan and his wife to reunite .
yes , isn &apos;t it ?
maybe we should go into couples therapy .
well , i have one more name
that i &apos;d like to add to our witness list .
paul houghton ?
of the bush administration ?
yes .
i wrote the memo to president george w. bush ,
since referred to as the houghton working memo .
it expressed the legal position
that certain aggressive interrogation techniques were not torture .
so what are you saying-- shen yuan was not tortured ?
well , i have no opinion on that .
i can tell you
the opinion of the bush administration at the time .
oh , well , let &apos;s hear about that .
shen yuan was forced to stand in the stress position
during his captivity . is this torture ?
well , as long as there was no organ failure
or serious impairment of body functions ,
then , in the opinion of the united states at the time , it was not .
well , shen yuan claims he was beaten and slapped .
is that torture ?
again , if there was no organ failure
or impairment of body function ,
then , in the opinion of the united states , it was not .
the united states has since revoked your legal opinions ,
mr. houghton .
yes . january 2009 .
oh , wow . that &apos;s too bad .
because shen yuan claims
that there was no such aggressive questioning after 2008 .
so , it was the opinion of the united states
that there was no torture at the time in question .
so , are you up for it ?
convincing him to lie ?
there just needs to be the possibility
of torture after january 2009 .
that &apos;s all .
this is so bizarre .
we need him to be tortured during the obama administration ,
or we hobble our case ?
and edelstein &apos;s .
do you want us to put somebody else on it ?
no .
what do you think ?
i think we &apos;re fine .
i always liked this office .
oh , you know , i used to have a dartboard over there .
could hit the bull &apos;s @-@ eye from my chair .
i remember that .
in fact ...
i kept a remnant of you .
what &apos;s the game here , peter ?
it &apos;s over .
you &apos;re out of the race .
really ? you have a gun ?
almost as good .
see , wendy could survive a nanny problem .
she &apos;s likeable and she &apos;s a mother ,
and she didn &apos;t try to cover it up .
you did .
people can forgive a lot ,
but they can &apos;t forgive a cover @-@ up .
what are you talking about ?
you hired a nanny for a summer ,
you paid her under the table ,
and then when you heard that we were on her trail ,
you tried to pay her to leave the country .
so , what , are you recording this ?
i don &apos;t have to record it .
we recorded the payoff .
then you know it was three months .
three months of a nanny taking care of my kids ,
not wendy &apos;s five years .
yes , but i also seem to recall a candidate at the last debate
who said , &quot; you can &apos;t just say , &apos; oops , my bad . &apos; &quot;
how do you think that sound bite &apos;s gonna play ?
you &apos;re a son of a bitch .
yeah .
not just that . you ...
you belong in the trophy case of sons of bitches .
you think i &apos;m in this job just to beat you , peter ?
just to exercise power ?
i &apos;m in this job to do good .
what do you think , you &apos;re the only person who wants to do good ?
get out of here . get out of my office .
good afternoon .
as you can imagine ,
the demands of this job are all @-@ encompassing ,
and i &apos;ve always said to myself ,
&quot; family first , job second , campaign third . &quot;
and for that reason ...
i am withdrawing my candidacy for this race .
get the candidate . they &apos;ll be calling for comment .
are you gonna tell him who discovered the nanny ?
no . i don &apos;t know .
i promised alicia not to bring the kids into the race .
you didn &apos;t ; they jumped in .
he &apos;s on . he &apos;s on .
sir ?
it &apos;s a two @-@ way race .
i am leaving this race purely
because of the pressures on my family .
yes !
oh , my gosh !
you kids want
some corn bread ?
oh , not now , jackie . we &apos;re okay .
so ... he recovered his memory
about being waterboarded in february of 2009 .
yes , all the pain and suffering
kept him from memorizing fully , until now .
well , i guess our friend , shen yuan ,
caught on to america pretty quickly .
you &apos;re a good teacher .
$ 30 million , and you stop handing over
dissident names .
i hate chicago .
it &apos;s a mean place .
unlike silicon valley ?
mm , all this ...
architecture .
we know the future , at least .
we know boundaries are disappearing .
china , north korea , they &apos;re all just concepts .
concepts holding us back .
from what ?
from a free flow of power and information .
that is the future .
see , you guys , you &apos;re all
just fighting over things .
you &apos;ve got a bag of pennies
when everyone else is using credit cards .
things are dead .
things are ... uncool .
no money ...
and we &apos;ll agree to stop handing names to china .
really ?
what happened ?
oh , you showed us the error of our ways .
you &apos;re getting out of china ?
we &apos;re considering it .
it &apos;s too much of a hassle , too protectionist .
so , are we agreed ?
good . then we ...
are out of here .
here we go .
in ten minutes ,
either bond will run this firm , or we will .
good job .
alicia .
you don &apos;t belong here .
what do you mean ?
i think we should talk .
they &apos;re undervaluing you .
i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m not interested .
i &apos;m persistent .
thank you , everyone .
well , here we are again .
on behalf of the name partners ,
i would like to thank everybody for making the time ,
and i would like to introduce a new face ,
mr. howard lyman .
here .
one of the first partners in this business ,
he thought he would return to the fold ,
and we welcome you with open arms .
now , at this point , i must express
some bafflement at the cause for this meeting .
i think you had some business , derrick .
yes . thank you .
now , we &apos;ve had some troubling reports of you ...
trying to steal clients and partners , diane ,
and start your own firm . now , the thing
we need to value more than anything at this firm is cohesion ,
and that is the only reason ...
what crap ! just vote .
thank you , david .
i &apos;d like to call a vote of all the equity partners
to censure and dismiss diane lockhart
as an equity partner .
would you like me to hand over the gavel for this vote ?
no . keep it .
do we have a second ?
second .
second .
any debate ?
just call the question . come on .
by a show of hands ,
who agrees to censure and dismiss me ?
19 , 20 ...
the motion falls short .
you had me fire my head of litigation and put you in .
yeah .
why ?
i don &apos;t like you .
are there any other motions ?
i move that we get rid of bond
and i get his office for my second secretary .
are there any seconds ?
second it .
by a show of hands ,
all those in favor ?
this when i vote ?
you stupid son of a bitch .
yep .
21 , 22 , 23-- the motion passes .
derrick bond has been removed as name partner .
and i get his office .
good plan .
nice execution .
we &apos;re the perfect couple .
yeah .
everything but the sex .
as you can imagine ,
the demands of this job are all @-@ encompassing .
but i &apos;ve always said to myself
family first , job second ...
zach .
hey , dad .
come here .
something wrong ?
no .
come here .
thank you .
you did it .
... gossip is inevitable ,
but i want my supporters to know
that i am leaving this race purely
because of the pressures on my family . thank you .
mr. childs ,
