do we know anything ?
no . they &apos;re in there now with the doctor .
we &apos;re lucky though .
the paramedics said it could have been a lot worse .
my god , how did this even happen ?
there he is . big day &apos;s coming up .
what do you want for your birthday , big dog ?
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m good .
come on . sky &apos;s the limit .
dream big , my boy .
well , i guess i could use a belt .
a belt ?
yeah , you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t need it .
extension cord works pretty good .
every year , luke &apos;s birthday falls right around thanksgiving ,
and so it gets lost in the holiday shuffle .
one year we forgot completely ,
and we had to improvise a cake of stuffing .
which , by the way , he was fine with .
he &apos;s one of those kids ,
you get him a gift and all he wants to do is play with the box .
yeah , one year we actually just got him a box ,
a really nice box .
and we made the mistake of putting it in a gift bag .
so he played with the gift bag .
we can &apos;t get it right .
no .
i feel terrible . we gotta do something .
oh , yeah .
you know , the family is gonna be together for thanksgiving ...
for the first time in i don &apos;t even know how long .
i am so with you . we should blow this out ...
and throw luke the best birthday party of all time .
yes . yes . and we &apos;ll order a whole bunch of pizzas ...
and set up an arts and crafts table .
a what ?
a crafts table .
you know , where everybody gathers around
and they make stuff , and then bam !
they got their own party favor .
sorry . i fell asleep
while you were describing the most boring party ever .
第一季第九集
see you in a few hours .
yeah .
thanks again for the karaoke machine .
i &apos;ll get it back to you right after the party .
that &apos;d be great .
please don &apos;t . i beg you .
don &apos;t bring it back .
okay .
hey , phil . are , uh , you getting a clown for today ?
oh , no . luke &apos;s not much of a clown fan .
really ?
yeah . he never liked &apos; em .
has he ever seen a good one ?
has- has anyone ?
really . so anyway , thanks again .
okay . see you later .
no clown ? no- no clown ?
let it go .
who throws a party without a clown ?
since the late &apos; 30s , i &apos;d say most people .
you know what ? we haven &apos;t gotten luke a present yet .
maybe a clown could be our present .
cameron . cameron .
if phil and claire wanted to get luke a clown ,
they would &apos;ve . this is not our party .
but-
this is not our party .
but i just-
fine .
what would you suggest we get him then , hmm ?
get him a gift card .
a gift card ?
yeah .
who hurt you ?
hey , gloria ,
you got any idea how to wrap one of these things ?
is that a crossbow ?
yeah .
am i the greatest grandpa in the world or what ?
we can &apos;t give luke a crossbow .
he pokes himself in the eye every time he uses a straw .
are you kidding ? i had one when i was his age .
my dad used to give me a quarter for every crow i bagged .
and i used to have a machete .
but times have changed .
he &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ll teach him how to use it .
hey , pal , how &apos;s it going ?
am i charming ?
oh , boy .
of course you &apos;re charming .
who said you were not charming ?
no one .
but there &apos;s a girl in my school , and i want her to like me .
i need your advice , jay .
really ?
she &apos;s gonna be at luke &apos;s party .
well , i &apos;m a little thrown .
i mean , you don &apos;t usually come to me for advice .
well , this is one area in which you &apos;ve done pretty well .
he has a point .
i &apos;ve tried everything to get her attention-
opening doors , having a milk sent over in the cafeteria .
nothing &apos;s worked .
here &apos;s the deal .
girls don &apos;t go for all that romantic stuff .
they go for power and success .
and since you don &apos;t have either one of those things ,
you &apos;re gonna be the funny guy .
no , no , no . i want the most dangerous reptile you &apos;ve got .
i have an iguana that eats crickets .
that &apos;d be scary if it was a birthday party for crickets .
seriously , jungle tanya ,
i need you step it up a notch .
is there anything that scares the cocoa out of you ?
uh , not really . i do have a bearded dragon .
ooh . does it-
no , it does not breathe fire .
well , then we &apos;re back to square one , aren &apos;t we ?
i couldn &apos;t get luke out of my mind .
i know i made a promise to mitchell ,
but some things are bigger than promises .
fizbo would be at that party .
hello , old friend .
it all happened so fast .
i keep thinking
there was something i could &apos;ve done .
no , don &apos;t blame yourself .
who could &apos;ve possibly seen it coming ?
sweetie , that &apos;s a rock wall . is that even safe ?
oh , my god .
honey , relax .
hey , has anyone ever gotten hurt on one of these things ?
i don &apos;t know , man . it &apos;s my first day .
see ?
they wouldn &apos;t let the new guy do it if it-
that did not make me feel better .
don &apos;t worry .
i signed , like , a hundred releases .
when did we decide all this ? i think it &apos;s too much .
see , i knew you &apos;d say that .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you .
so just relax . grab a snow cone .
there &apos;s a snow cone machine ?
yeah .
mom , just so you know , dylan cannot have mayonnaise .
that &apos;s random . why are you telling me that ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s coming to the party .
is that absolutely necessary ?
yes , because she can &apos;t go 10
minutes without her boyfriend &apos;s tongue in her mouth .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s feeding a baby bird .
don &apos;t be so jealous .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll meet someone super hot at computer camp .
girls .
hey . hey .
so , what you got there ?
these are supplies for the crafts table .
i finally figured out what we &apos;re gonna be making .
kids bored ?
i &apos;m teasing . i &apos;m teasing .
it looks good . what is it ?
comb sheaths .
i know . i know .
but we made them when i was 11 years old
at donna rigby &apos;s birthday party .
at first we thought it was really stupid ,
and then we had a blast , so-
how could you not ?
you combined the two things that kids love the most-
combs and sheaths .
i &apos;m kidding !
where &apos;s my comb ? oh !
here it is in my incredibly convenient beaded comb sheath ...
that i made at luke &apos;s awesome birthday party .
hole in one , mrs. dunphy .
hole in one .
i &apos;m home .
i got luke a video game , but it &apos;s about math .
so i guess we &apos;re those kind of uncles .
cam .
don &apos;t be mad .
oh . cam . uh-
i &apos;ve known i wanted to be a clown ...
since i found out clowns were just people with makeup .
um , as a matter of fact , by the time i was a teenager ,
if i wasn &apos;t in school or fishin &apos; , i was clownin &apos; .
there are four types of clowns
a tramp , an auguste ,
a whiteface and a character .
i am a classically trained auguste clown
named fizbo .
what ? n @-@ nothing .
between the clownin &apos; and the fishin &apos; ,
i &apos;m surprised you had time for the schoolin &apos; .
aw , and there &apos;s the fifth type- the sad clown .
sad clown is a tramp . so there &apos;s still only four types .
cam , i thought we discussed this .
we did . but i- i started thinking .
and this isn &apos;t about you or me .
this is about a little boy who deserves some happiness .
and he &apos;s gonna get that from his weird gay clown uncle ?
fizbo is not gay . he &apos;s asexual .
he &apos;s an innocent whose only drive ...
is to bring people joy and laughter
and balloon animals .
he &apos;s- he &apos;s the least sexual being on earth .
oh , okay . well , at least we agree on something .
if this tape is found in the future ,
this is how we humans celebrated birthdays .
hey , dad !
yeah , there &apos;s my boy . zip @-@ line extreme-
i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m good . i &apos;m good .
lesson learned . don &apos;t stand- don &apos;t stand there .
let &apos;s go ahead and rope this area off .
excellent . thank you .
hey , buddy , you having fun ?
yeah . and i love my new belt .
hey , luke . look .
do you wanna make a comb sheath ?
a what ?
it &apos;s a cool leather holder for your comb .
and you can decorate it .
i &apos;ve got beads and glitter and all kinds of stuff .
do you want to ?
nah . i &apos;m gonna do the rock wall .
okay , honey . it &apos;s your day .
honey , let me know if you get low on supplies .
i &apos;ll make a quick run back to the 1950s for you .
oh ! again ?
seriously , zip @-@ line guys , use some ropes .
did you remember to switch the whites to the dryer ?
oh , no . i forgot .
they &apos;re gonna smell musty .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll pump .
no , no , no . i &apos;ll do it . you stay right here .
relax .
oh . i get it .
you &apos;re worried about people seeing me .
without question .
you know , people are gonna stare .
they &apos;re not used to seeing one clown in a car .
that &apos;s her- bianca douglas .
she &apos;s so cute .
she has good handwriting .
she &apos;s a complete package . wish me luck .
you don &apos;t need luck .
you just remember those jokes i told you , hmm ?
we have to stop meeting like this .
what ?
we go to school together .
oh , yeah .
do you like jokes ?
sure .
great . ok .
so a grasshopper named gary walks into a bar .
aw . no .
you &apos;re not supposed to know his name .
let me try another one , okay ?
knock , knock .
who &apos;s there ?
笑点是who和moo的英文发音相似 &#93;
interrupting cow .
interrupting cow who ?
moo . oh , crap .
um , hey .
hey yourself .
move .
you kind of just bumped me with your car .
i don &apos;t think so .
no . no , you did , because , um-
see , yeah , i got grease on my pants
and then also i felt it .
call an ambulance .
okay . i just thought you might wanna know ...
in case you wanted to be a decent human being and apologize , but-
no ? okay .
ass .
what did you say ?
just forget about it , all right ?
listen , carrottop . i didn &apos;t touch you .
um , i-
so do the smart thing . shut your hole ,
get in your car and drive away .
is there a problem here ?
what the hell are you ?
i &apos;m the ass @-@ kicking clown ...
that &apos;ll twist you like a balloon animal .
i will beat your head against this bumper
until the air bags deploy .
so apologize to my boyfriend right now !
apologize ? boyfriend ?
apologize !
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
let &apos;s go . we &apos;re gonna be late .
mind if i come in ?
sure .
come here .
why you bounce so sad ?
i told all my jokes .
it turns out i &apos;m not the funny guy .
the right girl will find you when it &apos;s time ,
even though i &apos;m gonna hate losing you to another woman .
you &apos;ll never lose me , mom .
i &apos;ll always love you , no matter what .
ay , chiquitn .
you see ? right there .
you need no tricks .
just be the sweet , wonderful little boy that you are .
sweet little boy . got it .
she won &apos;t know what hit her .
vaya para all !
hey , manny , wanna make a sweet comb sheath ?
could not be a worse time , claire .
oh . it &apos;s so peaceful and quiet over here .
ha @-@ ha . if you came over here to gloat ,
i already know it &apos;s a dud .
actually , i came to give you this .
it &apos;s your favorite flavor- blue .
thanks , honey .
and your hair looks really nice . hmm .
thanks .
i &apos;ve been combing it all day .
all right , let &apos;s all give luke a big hand for being so brave .
this feels so weird . what does it eat ?
oh , just little boy brains .
well , at least luke &apos;s got nothing to worry about .
is there mayo in this ?
no . you &apos;re good .
so i was thinking that maybe we could go slip away-
so , does anyone wanna pet the iguana ?
hells , yeah . oh , man .
over here ! me ! me !
i love lizards .
what &apos;s his name ?
her name is lizzy .
wow . i totally get that .
you don &apos;t deserve this .
what ?
hot reptile chick .
you know , probably has her own apartment ,
obviously okay touching gross stuff .
they &apos;re just talking .
you &apos;re right .
dylan &apos;s far too sophisticated to get sucked in ...
by a single lady with tons of cool tattoos .
hey . i think it peed on me .
oh , no .
no way , mother nature .
i can &apos;t believe he does that .
hey , what am i missing , guys ?
aw , geez , gloria .
jay , look ! i go high ! look ! look !
guys , hit the road . come on .
you &apos;re family men . come on . scat .
great job , buddy .
now comes the fun part . rappel down .
it &apos;s really high .
you have nothing to fear but fear itself ...
and the concrete .
but i &apos;m right here , buddy .
okay , just catch me .
i am brave . roller coasters ? love &apos; em .
scary movies ? i &apos;ve seen ghostbusters , like , seven times .
i regularly drive through neighborhoods ...
that have only recently been gentrified .
so yeah , i &apos;m pretty much not afraid of anything .
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , everybody !
quit your clownin &apos; around . that &apos;s my job .
except clowns .
never shared that with the fam , so ... shh .
do have an image to maintain .
i am not really sure where the fear comes from .
my mother says it &apos;s because when i was a kid ,
i found a dead clown in the woods , but who knows ?
hey . oh . well , you must be the birthday boy .
is that you , uncle cam ?
no . i &apos;m fizbo the clown .
i don &apos;t know who this uncle cam is ,
but he sure sounds handsome , doesn &apos;t he ?
hey , who likes balloon animals ?
i do ! i do !
it &apos;s just cam . it &apos;s just cam .
you all right ?
what ? yeah .
just have kind of a complicated relationship with clowns .
well , join the club .
look , i came on strong with that whole funny guy bit .
this is me just being myself .
okay . hey , do you know who that boy is over there ?
oh . that &apos;s dylan . he &apos;s haley &apos;s boyfriend .
he &apos;s so cute and tall .
i &apos;m still growing . give me a break .
pardon me , miss , but this little doggy needs a new home .
oh , thank you .
that &apos;s quite an impressive getup you got there .
thank you , jay . oh , by the way ,
you have something on your shoulder .
that &apos;s good .
never mind . it was nothing .
we &apos;re done here .
so , do you keep these at a zoo or something ?
no . i just keep &apos; em at my place .
that &apos;s awesome .
i only have a cat .
yeah ? i used to have a cat .
i was just messing with you before ,
but seriously , he &apos;s still talking to her .
wow . cool .
on it .
you know , this is one of-
i feel like britney spears .
you &apos;re so funny .
you kind of do look like britney spears .
really ?
i &apos;m just kidding .
anyway , this is probably my favorite .
hey , jungle lady ?
i think- i think one of your bugs got out .
what ? this one ?
this box thing here- it &apos;s on its side .
oh , my god . where did it go ?
is everything okay ?
no . i lost a poisonous scorpion , and i need to find it .
okay , kids , let &apos;s all tuck our pants into our socks .
avoid shady , moist places ,
and let &apos;s make a game of looking where we step .
is he okay ?
can we see him ?
he &apos;s in with the doctor right now .
these things happen , right ?
no matter how careful you are .
hey , look what grandpa gave me- a crossbow .
sweetie , that does not look safe .
don &apos;t worry .
he &apos;s gonna show me how to use it .
that &apos;s what ... i &apos;m afraid of .
come on . ready ?
oh , my god . you are not making comb sheaths .
i am , and i know . it &apos;s really lame .
everybody hates it .
no . it &apos;s just like , uh , donna rigby &apos;s party .
exactly ! yes ! and i have the beads and everything .
amazing . this is awesome .
so ... cam &apos;s a clown .
yeah .
i totally got you .
and there &apos;s mine .
you think it &apos;s weird
that we both chose people who were so- uninhibited ?
i was gonna say &quot; embarrassing , &quot; but yeah .
look at them now . they &apos;re the life of the party .
uh , you know , i gotta say , for all his craziness ,
i love my clown .
me too . they &apos;re good for us .
i would &apos;ve totally tanked this party .
and i would &apos;ve gotten my butt kicked at a gas station .
sorry ?
turns out fizbo is a real bad @-@ ass .
scorpion ! scorpion ! scorpion !
scorpion !
no , no . too close . too close . too close .
what the hell ?
oh , crap !
calm down .
what happened ?
we fired the crossbow .
no , i know . oh , my god . it &apos;s right there .
bianca , i &apos;m coming .
who else is in there ?
get out !
it turns out i &apos;m not the sweet guy or the funny guy .
no , manny , don &apos;t go in ! por favor !
i must !
i &apos;m coming !
manny delgado is a man of action .
wait . my dog is still in there .
i &apos;ll be right back .
ow ! my arm !
sweetie ? luke ?
what happened , buddy ?
what happened ?
what happened , honey ?
hey , hey . what happened ?
i slipped on these stupid beads .
oops .
come on . here we go .
how is he ?
oh , he &apos;s gonna be fine .
ay , dios mio .
hi , honey . how are you , kid ?
oh , there he is .
pobrecito .
you poor thing .
wow . everybody &apos;s here .
of course we are . how &apos;s that busted flipper ?
okay .
sorry about today , buddy .
we &apos;ll try again next year , huh ?
are you kidding ? this was the best birthday ever .
what ?
i got a cast .
you like a cast ?
i &apos;ve always wanted one .
after a few weeks , they start to smell .
ew !
you are so weird , you know that ?
can i sign it ?
sure .
hey . me first .
here .
if you &apos;d asked me before the party ...
if i wanted there to be a chain reaction of disasters ...
that led to luke breaking his arm , i probably would &apos;ve said no .
probably ?
prob- definite- definitely not .
would not want that .
but , one way or another ,
luke was the center of attention on his birthday ,
and the whole family was together ...
just the way it should be .
fizbo delivery ! i brought the cake !
bravo !
i can &apos;t do this .
oh , god . i &apos;m out .
cake .
blow the candles . blow the candles .
bianca douglas called me three times tonight .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you .
i &apos;m starting to feel smothered .
i really like my cast , but it &apos;s starting to itch .
good thing my mom made me this personal scratcher .
oh , that &apos;s good stuff .
if another woman is messing with your man ,
you have to get proactive .
i don &apos;t care how pretty she is
or how many stupid reptiles she has .
she tries to take what &apos;s mine ,
girlfriend &apos;s gonna get stung .
