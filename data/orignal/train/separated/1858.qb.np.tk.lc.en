renegades .
rule breakers .
gangsters with scalpels .
this is the way we like to think of ourselves .
it makes us feel badass ,
sexy .
can you wash this , too ?
jackson .
is there anywhere you don &apos;t do it ?
no ?
we should go upstairs .
yeah .
problem is ,
it &apos;s not exactly true .
at heart , we &apos;re rule followers ,
sheep .
we don &apos;t break protocol .
we follow it to a &quot; t . &quot;
why is there a trailer in my parking spot ?
is one of these yours ?
my bad .
you &apos;re living here ,
in a trailer in the parking lot ?
well , i &apos;m in the race for chief resident , you know ?
i get to the surgeries first .
i &apos;m here when the chief arrives .
just get the thing out of my spot .
and move my car .
because if we don &apos;t follow protocol ,
our patients die .
and then we &apos;re no longer badass .
we &apos;re just bad .
when are the two of you finally getting married ?
meredith and derek already got married , honey .
remember ?
i know that .
they wrote on a post @-@ it .
i meant a real wedding .
in a church , with a white dress .
this isn &apos;t alzheimer &apos;s , richard .
adele , the tests we ran last month
showed findings consistent with early @-@ onset alzheimer &apos;s .
i was a nurse for 30 years , derek .
i know what alzheimer &apos;s looks like .
i also know that 20 % of the people
that are diagnosed with it
turn out to have something else .
i don &apos;t have alzheimer &apos;s . i don &apos;t .
so a lot of patients need time
to come to terms with their diagnosis .
the same thing happened to my mother .
we don &apos;t have time .
derek , we need to get adele in
on your trial right now .
we need her consent to even consider her .
look , i &apos;ll take care of that . don &apos;t worry .
we don &apos;t even know if she fits the criteria .
and the trial is full .
even the waiting list is full .
i know all of that .
i also know that you &apos;ll do
whatever you need to do to help my wife .
everything looks fine .
right on track for 23 and a half weeks .
how &apos;s his size ?
oh , mark .
it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m used to that trick .
its size is within the norm .
come on . we &apos;re here .
you know you want to know .
no , no , no , no . you want to know .
we prefer an element of surprise .
callie ?
mark , we voted .
2 @-@ to @-@ 1 . we &apos;re waiting .
uh , your b.p. is borderline high .
are you feeling okay ?
oh , yeah , no .
that &apos;s the nerves about the baby shower .
ah . yeah , it &apos;s like , um ,
it &apos;s like christmas morning .
you are way too excited about this .
hey , i have bought expensive gifts
and played stupid games
for every knocked @-@ up nurse in this place .
now it &apos;s my turn .
you &apos;re coming , right ?
arizona , you invite the o.b ..
the fate of my vagina &apos;s in her hands .
um , 1 : 00 p.m. , fourth floor doctor &apos;s lounge .
i &apos;ll see if i can make it .
i &apos;ll make it .
what &apos;s that about ?
oh , chief &apos;s in the bathroom .
with an audience ?
his trial funding came through this morning ,
and they all want on it .
door &apos;s opening !
quiet ! quiet !
i haven &apos;t made my decision yet .
oh , get out of the way .
stalking a man while he &apos;s in the restroom ?
i &apos;d clean the restroom if he &apos;d let me on this trial .
i &apos;d live in it .
you are surgeons .
if you want to impress the chief ,
impress him surgically .
avery , you &apos;re with me .
so you &apos;ve been all buddy @-@ buddy with webber lately .
i am staying out of it , but you ...
you are very beautiful .
oh , screw beautiful . i &apos;m brilliant .
if you want to appease me , compliment my brain .
okay .
ah , sonya . you ready for the big day ?
you bet .
try to shave as little of my head as possible .
it &apos;s hard enough dating with alzheimer &apos;s .
i can &apos;t be bald , too .
i promise . you must be tarik .
congratulations on the marathon , by the way .
you didn &apos;t .
he &apos;s not like other doctors .
he &apos;s actually interested in his patients .
yeah , i heard you just moved back from london .
yeah , i came as soon as
you accepted us into the trial .
i can &apos;t thank you enough .
no , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . thank you .
all right , i &apos;m gonna let dr. grey
get on with her work ,
and i &apos;ll see you in a little bit .
okay , mrs. amin , i &apos;m going to say three words to you
and ask you to repeat them back to me later .
truck . cabin . spoon .
truck . cabin . spoon .
okay .
uh , what did you do for thanksgiving last year ?
oh ! i was in london visiting tarik .
what ? why ? is that wrong ?
last year , you were at the simmons &apos; , remember ?
no . i was with you and gavin in london .
i have that picture outside the palace .
that was three years ago , mom ,
before we broke up .
you really should call him .
he broke up with me . we &apos;re not getting back together .
sorry . out of all the things she can &apos;t remember ,
she still remembers the ex .
okay , starting at 100 , count backwards by 7 .
100 .
93 .
good morning , clara .
good &apos;s kind of pushing it .
yeah , i hear you .
uh , dr. avery .
clara green , 42,
type 1 diabetic .
eight weeks post @-@ op from a tumor resection .
you know what ? no , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t listen to the kid today .
i would like to hear from the grown @-@ up doctor .
sean .
i don &apos;t want to hear from the stupid kid anymore !
i want answers .
okay , sean , um ,
i know it &apos;s incredibly frustrating--
you don &apos;t know .
my kids are in iowa living with my parents .
okay , i barely survived that house .
now i &apos;m inflicting it on my kids ?
diabetes is a bear of an illness .
now the tumor removal was successful ,
but we knew it could be tough
getting the insulin levels on track .
and , yeah , it has been tough .
well , that &apos;s not good enough anymore .
we are doing everything--
sean , she &apos;s doing better than any of us expected .
you remember when we talked about how
she might not make it through the surgery ?
dr. bailey said she was prepared to roll the dice ,
but surgery was a gamble .
clara rocked it .
and if she can do that , she can do anything .
you need any help today ?
robbins has her baby shower , so i &apos;m free .
i still don &apos;t like you , karev .
dude .
good @-@ bye .
i just finished recasting the o &apos;connor girl .
did you still need me to change jason cook &apos;s drain ?
nope . all done .
so you can handle the rest of the patients , right ?
i think we got a thoracentesis in there .
really ?
yeah .
thank you .
we &apos;re on for tonight , 7 : 00 reservation ?
oh , you know it .
all right .
you &apos;re gonna screw your way to the top . i &apos;m impressed .
i am not screwing stark .
i am not screwing stark .
we &apos;re not even dating .
we &apos;re not even dating .
i &apos;m serious . we &apos;re not .
okay , maybe i thought we were at first .
but it &apos;s not like that now . we &apos;re just hanging out .
we &apos;re friends .
yeah , naked friends .
what do you have ?
jogger found unconscious on the street . no i.d.
dr. yang &apos;s running the code .
he &apos;s in v @-@ fib .
okay .
clear .
you had chest pain , so you decided to go for a jog ?
ow !
oh . sorry .
how much morphine did you give him ?
10 .
he shouldn &apos;t be in this much pain .
give him more .
so what is this , a heart attack ?
&apos;cause it sure feels like one .
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re gonna have to run some tests to find out .
a jog ? !
hey , it &apos;s not like i went out for a cheeseburger .
her name is clara green . now i know it &apos;s premature ,
but i was thinking she could be a candidate for your trial .
look , i still don &apos;t have approval from the fda , bailey .
sir , these people are desperate .
if we could just make them first on the list
to give &apos; em something to look forward to .
well , why not just do the surgery today ?
avery , just because a patient called you a stupid kid
doesn &apos;t mean you should act like one .
she can &apos;t even take immunosuppressants
without risking her tumor coming back .
she &apos;s deteriorating by the hour .
why not apply for an emergency waiver ?
because if something goes wrong during the surgery ,
then it would kill the chief &apos;s chance for getting approval .
sir , her kids are stuck in iowa ...
dr. avery--
... with their grandparents , who are mean , sir .
chief , dr. altman &apos;s paging you .
i &apos;ll call the fda ,
see if we can get a waiver .
get the patient on board .
okay .
what ? i ...
where do you want this ?
what &apos;s that for ?
scrapbook station .
put it next to that box with the glitter pens .
oh , no , no , no .
don &apos;t put it anywhere . we &apos;re not having a scrapbook station .
you heard callie this morning .
she wants us to go all out .
move the table .
no , don &apos;t move the table .
mark , this isn &apos;t a scrapbook station kind of shower .
you &apos;re wrong . yang , tell her .
torres wants all the girlie stuff--
games , onesie decorating .
i have a patient .
grey ?
i can &apos;t get over the fact that you know
what onesie decorating is .
i &apos;ve been boning up .
that &apos;s what you do for the people you love .
oh , bite me , mark .
oh , what &apos;s going on ?
are you guys fighting again ?
did you want a scrapbook station ?
oh , yeah . of course . it &apos;s not a real shower
if you don &apos;t get to take home a scrapbook .
ooh , we should have glitter pens !
no , you can &apos;t . because if you quit and move here ,
you &apos;ll get depressed and start to hate me .
look , i have to go . just ...
please stop calling . good @-@ bye .
they &apos;re ready . can you bring the chart ?
sorry . the boyfriend thing is a little more complicated
than she can handle .
so you two are still together or--
no . why ?
well , we require the caretaker
to be a full @-@ time resident
of the state of washington .
i know that .
okay . i mean , it &apos;s a big commitment .
and it may not feel like it now , but six months from now ,
a year down the road-- it can get overwhelming .
and if you think you might move back to london , if there &apos;s
even the slightest chance , you need to let us know .
look , when i came out to my family ,
my mother stood by me , she loved me .
and i know that may not seem like a big deal to you ,
but in my family , where we come from , being gay isn &apos;t something
people just come to accept after a while .
it &apos;s a crime , and--and people die because of it .
and--and my father refused to deal with it , so he left .
he got a new wife , and my mom lost everything .
this--this is the least i could do for her .
i &apos;m committed to this trial , dr. grey .
okay .
now islet cells produce insulin .
we would put the cells in a device in your body ,
and it will act like a brand @-@ new pancreas .
we &apos;re contacting the fda
to get their approval right now .
say yes . okay , i @-@ i yelled at him this morning .
i acted like an ass--
what are the risks ?
i mean , they have to be pretty serious , right ?
otherwise , the fda would &apos;ve already approved it .
dr. bailey ?
y @-@ yeah , there are risks , of course .
i was just about to get there .
um ... there &apos;s heavy bleeding ,
uh , low platelet counts ,
um , and stress on the liver .
but in clara &apos;s condition ,
e @-@ especially since we &apos;ve done everything else ,
um , this really is the best option .
can we have some more time ? is that okay ?
oh , y--of course . yeah .
t @-@ take all the time you need .
eli ?
go do something else .
what was that ?
what was what ?
i was getting to those risks .
you interrupted me to seem like i was hiding something .
well , in my experience , doctors do hide things .
i just asked a question they didn &apos;t know to ask .
that &apos;s all .
no , that &apos;s not your job .
i think it is .
to undermine surgeons and alarm patients ?
to care for patients-- that &apos;s my job .
making sure they understand
what highly experimental procedures
they &apos;re signing up for seems a part of that .
oh , i thought that was my job , you know ,
especially considering that i am the one who specializes
in said highly experimental procedures .
oh . okay . i get it . you &apos;re the doctor . i &apos;m the nurse .
i should know my place , right ?
n--okay , enough .
um , there is a doctor @-@ nurse protocol
in this hospital for a reason .
you know it . i know it . let &apos;s just agree to follow it .
not if it hurts the patient .
hey . you paged .
yeah . um , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be able
to make it to dinner by 7 : 00 .
these post @-@ ops are taking
me longer than i thought .
okay , skip dinner .
hey , you know , &lt; i &gt; from here to eternity &lt; / i &gt; is on cable .
we could just grab dinner at my place .
okay . sounds fun .
um , i still don &apos;t know what time i &apos;ll finish .
karev , could you help dr. kepner with her patients ?
now you need my help ?
don &apos;t push me , dude .
okay , so if you take these ,
then i can do the rest .
what ?
the only way you &apos;ll be watching that movie
is if it &apos;s playing on his bedroom ceiling .
his e.k.g. and cardiac enzymes were normal ,
so a heart attack seems unlikely .
we &apos;re doing a c.t. angio to rule out dissection or aneurysm .
dr. altman , you okay to stay on the case ,
considering your personal relationship ?
richard , we &apos;ve been over this .
it &apos;s a business arrangement . nothing more .
how are you feeling ?
great . great .
great . great , great , great .
painkillers finally kicked in , huh ?
well , enjoy the ride .
i &apos;ve been thinking lately ,
and i think--i , uh , i think i figured it out .
and ... why all of your dates go so bad .
so , so bad .
laughably bad .
and it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s mine , &apos; cause i &apos;m--i &apos;m not the guy on them with you .
we &apos;re ready to start .
teddy , wait , wait .
you &apos;re my wife .
you &apos;re my wife .
henry , um--
i &apos;m your husband .
let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s be together .
i mean , look at you .
look at your eyes .
look at--you &apos;re not looking at your eyes .
i could look into your eyes my whole life .
business arrangement ?
he &apos;s hopped up on painkillers .
which just means his inhibitions are down .
oh , come on , richard .
look , even if he meant what he said , i--
i don &apos;t feel that way . i @-@ i don &apos;t .
and scans are up .
damn it . he &apos;s got a mass . it &apos;s close to his heart .
i &apos;m gonna have to take it out right away .
you ?
i &apos;m not sure i should allow you in that o.r.
let alone allow you to operate on him .
chief , with all due respect--
i can do it .
it &apos;s an extremely delicate surgery .
i soloed on a similar surgery last month .
i nailed it ... is what you said .
problem solved .
yang will do the surgery . you &apos;ll supervise .
chief--
i &apos;ve made my decision , dr. altman .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me .
he was gonna kick you out of the o.r.
at least this way , you get to stay in .
it &apos;s win @-@ win .
don &apos;t feel bad . i &apos;ve known torres a long time .
she &apos;s a traditional girl , catholic .
you know , this whole baby @-@ out @-@ of @-@ wedlock thing ,
the three parents--it &apos;s a lot for her to swallow .
that &apos;s why i figured , the bigger shower , the better .
oh , shut up .
excuse me ?
you &apos;re not the callie whisperer .
and i &apos;m not a monster for finding baby showers annoying .
every woman who &apos;s ever had a pregnant friend hates them .
it &apos;s like a wedding .
the bridesmaids always want to strangle the bride .
it &apos;s practically a rule .
the only one who &apos;s not normal here is you for acting like
you &apos;re enjoying this .
okay , arizona &apos;s turn .
uh , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine over here . thanks .
oh , just &apos; cause i &apos;m the pregnant one
doesn &apos;t mean you don &apos;t get to play .
come on . it &apos;ll be fun .
it &apos;s what the bride wants .
i &apos;m going .
i &apos;m glad you came . i know it &apos;s awkward .
no , you know , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s--i &apos;m--i &apos;m hap--
i &apos;m happy for you , you know .
and , uh , plus , i &apos;m seeing somebody else , so ...
really ?
yeah .
that &apos;s , uh ... good for you .
do i know him ?
i should go .
i know they &apos;re not paying you well ,
but this seems a little extreme .
ah , i just moved into my own place .
i don &apos;t have time to shop . pass me those cookies .
all these people in here , and you came to talk to me .
you like me .
no , i &apos;m talking to you because i want something to eat ,
and you &apos;re in the way .
admit it . you find me charming .
are those pigs in a blanket ?
hot . dirty hot .
it was good talking to you , dr. karev .
i say he &apos;s totally gay .
well , if he were gay ,
then why would he ask april out ?
no straight guy waits a whole month
before making a move .
maybe he has herpes .
that wouldn &apos;t stop a guy either . i vote gay .
i just wish he was into me ,
then i could be in all his cool surgeries , too .
he &apos;s not gay , he doesn &apos;t have herpes ,
and i &apos;m not using him to get cool surgeries .
we have a lot to talk about , okay ?
he &apos;s really interesting once you get to know him .
which is why she &apos;s taking her pants off for him tonight .
what ?
she &apos;s going to his place .
&lt; i &gt; from here to eternity &lt; / i &gt; is playing on cable .
oh , yeah .
pants are definitely coming off .
nobody &apos;s pants are coming off .
movie at his place ?
that &apos;s the definition of pants coming off .
virgin &apos;s a goner .
and with an older man , too . it &apos;s very impressive .
i am not taking my pants off for stark !
oh , my god . that is so ugly .
are you still blind ?
i like it . it &apos;s abstract .
check it out . scrubs .
yes , i will do a consult now .
you &apos;re not fooling anyone .
chief .
uh , derek .
i need a favor .
i &apos;m applying for an emergency waiver with the fda .
i need you to call your guy that helped you
through your trial over there ,
see if he can push my request through .
all right . i &apos;ll see what i can do .
but you &apos;re the chief of surgery . i &apos;m not sure
how much more pull i &apos;m gonna have .
there &apos;s always ways to work the system , derek .
we both know that .
i can &apos;t put adele in my trial , richard .
i &apos;ve looked at it all day .
well , go over it again .
you &apos;re not hearing me .
i love adele ,
but i can &apos;t pull a patient off the waiting list .
it could compromise the whole trial .
it could get us blacklisted by the fda .
look , adele has no future without this !
chief .
yes .
sorry . it , uh , it &apos;s clara green .
you need to come now .
what happened ?
sugar bottomed out again . no response .
why won &apos;t she wake up ?
uh , she &apos;s in a hypoglycemic coma .
her sugar dropped too fast , so her brain doesn &apos;t have
enough to feed on .
sats are dropping , and she &apos;s got rales .
i &apos;m gonna set up to intubate .
what ? wait . w @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
mr. green , there &apos;s no time to wait .
now if we &apos;re gonna try this islet cell transplant ,
we need to do it now . we just need your consent .
yeah , of course . you do whatever you need to do .
all right .
let &apos;s book an o.r.
sir , the fda hasn &apos;t given us the waiver .
look , i know that .
this woman will die without this surgery .
now book an o.r. now .
i don &apos;t understand .
why does dr. yang have to do the surgery ?
well , you and i are technically married ,
and the hospital doesn &apos;t allow doctors
to treat family members .
right , because how can you stay objective ?
your feelings get in the way .
is it wrong that i &apos;m a little flattered
that , uh , you won &apos;t operate on me ?
ahem . dr. yang is excellent .
and i will be there to supervise .
i &apos;ll see you in surgery .
she &apos;s into me , right ?
can i have your arm , please ?
so this karev guy ,
you &apos;re actually friends with him ?
that &apos;s real ?
yeah . why ?
uh , just it surprises me , is all .
i mean , you don &apos;t seem like the type of girl
to put up with his whole neanderthal thing , so ...
tell me . what am i missing ?
you &apos;re missing a lot .
he had a girl go crazy on him .
his wife almost died , and then she walked out on him .
and then he was shot and almost bled to death in an elevator .
he &apos;s been through a lot .
so the neanderthal thing is just ... it is an act .
a well @-@ executed one .
we are through the peritoneum and ready for the implant .
anything from the fda ?
nothing , chief .
damn it .
sir , i @-@ i think we should wait .
the longer we wait , the worse she gets .
i know , but ... are you sure we &apos;re doing this
for the right reason ,
that you &apos;re not trying to prove a point to shepherd , maybe ?
i &apos;m thinking of my patient here , bailey .
that &apos;s all .
hybrid device .
implanting it in the omentum ,
near the large intestine loops .
i left my phone when i went to the cafeteria .
she saw gavin &apos;s name , so she picked up .
please . you can &apos;t let her do this .
we &apos;ll talk to her . don &apos;t worry .
what &apos;s going on , sonya ?
i &apos;m not doing the trial .
i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;ve wasted your time .
mom , just listen to him .
i don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m going home , and you &apos;re going to london . it &apos;s done .
sonya , you were chosen from hundreds of applicants ,
and this surgery-- i can &apos;t guarantee anything--
but it could help .
there won &apos;t be another opportunity like this .
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve made up my mind .
please take me off your list .
she &apos;s not lucid , dr. shepherd .
this is just the alzheimer &apos;s .
she &apos;s already consented .
my name is sonya lela amin . i was born sonya beshari .
my parents were ahmed and saleemeh beshari .
i live at 3105 river road .
i spent last thanksgiving with the simmons &apos; ,
but three years before , i was in london with gavin ,
who did not break up with you . you broke up with him ...
last week , when i got on the trial .
you did that for me ,
and that makes me very proud .
i raised a good son .
you are a good son .
go back to london . be with gavin .
ready to resect the tumor .
bovie .
slow and steady .
any disturbance to his heart ,
and he could go into a hypertensive crisis .
he &apos;s pre @-@ medicated . i &apos;m all over it .
steady , yang .
i got it .
good , good .
now just irrigate and explore .
b.p. &apos; s shooting up .
what did you do , cristina ?
i don &apos;t know . suction .
damn it , cristina .
i got it . don &apos;t worry .
all right . check for residual tumor .
i am . you know , i need more light . pickups .
hurry up . come on . did you find anything ?
cristina ?
cristina , i need you to talk to me right now .
do you need me to do this ?
i need you to shut up and stop acting like a scared wife .
there , i got it . i ... i got it .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to--
no , no , it &apos;s--it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s just ...
thank you .
hey , richard .
you know , i just did my first trial surgery
without fda approval .
maybe they &apos;ll take my license .
maybe they &apos;ll blacklist me .
you know what ? i don &apos;t care . i saved a life .
yes . uh , richard .
yeah ?
someone just dropped out of my trial .
that &apos;s why you dragged me back in here--
for another test ?
it &apos;s just a few questions
to see if you meet the criteria , honey .
and then what ?
i let derek drill into my brain for no reason ?
look , i just did a surgery that i wasn &apos;t approved to do .
i did it because i knew i didn &apos;t have any time to wait .
the patient would &apos;ve died .
it &apos;s the same for you .
you have alzheimer &apos;s , honey .
you do . there &apos;s no time to wait to treat it .
please take the test , baby .
do it for me .
fine .
i &apos;ll take the test .
thank you .
but i &apos;m going to pass .
that way ...
you &apos;ll see i &apos;m fine , healthy .
we &apos;re going to grow old together
just like we always said .
we &apos;re going to grow old together .
what is that , a tumbleweed , a hurricane ?
what &apos;s your problem ?
oh , someone threw out the gift list ,
and now we don &apos;t know who got what ,
and people are gonna think of us as the type of people
who write vague and impersonal thank @-@ you notes .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s actually a type of people .
what &apos;s going on ?
arizona lost the gift list .
yes , mark . i lost the list .
i @-@ i @-@ i suck at this . congratulations .
you &apos;re a better woman than i am .
hey , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s not a big deal .
mark , can you give us a minute ?
she lost the gift list , not me .
mark .
so ... there is one more gift left to open .
oh , i @-@ i didn &apos;t get you anything .
you got me a shower .
open it .
毗邻西雅图 远离雨城嚣
it &apos;s a b &amp; b a few hours away .
we leave in the morning .
but i have patients , and you have patients--
look , look , i &apos;m extending an olive branch here ,
because i know how annoying i must be to you right now .
but since i was 4 and i got that doll
that craps its pants for christmas ,
i &apos;ve wanted a kid ,
because other than cracking bones , this--
this baby is my dream .
and i get to be insanely , out @-@ of @-@ my @-@ mind happy for my dream .
but i &apos;m not discounting your need to vomit over my insanity .
so just ...
let me ... let me take you to the stupid b &amp; b for the weekend .
and thank you .
what did you do for thanksgiving last year ?
mm . nothing .
uh , richard and i stayed home ,
ordered in chinese ,
and it was lovely .
okay .
starting at 100,
count backwards by 7 .
100 .
93 .
86 .
the rodriguez boy
had an incarcerated incisional hernia ,
but we did conscious sedation and were able to reduce it .
this was all while i was in surgery . i am impressed .
well , dr. karev did most of it , actually .
oh , dr. karev ? okay . well , that &apos;s good to know .
i &apos;ll check to make sure it was done right .
robert , just say thank you .
thank you , dr. karev . now go away .
oh , my god . i am so sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to call you that .
there &apos;s no need to apologize , dr. kepner .
no , no , no . it was completely unprofessional .
i promise i will never-- i completely--
hey , april ... i &apos;m saying , i liked it .
i @-@ i @-@ i can &apos;t make it tonight .
to ... what ?
the new chief resident is getting picked soon ,
and--and--and e @-@ everyone is stepping up their game ,
so i should probably just stay late here ... work .
i &apos;m sorry . i ...
i understand .
we &apos;ve got the age difference , we work together ,
not to mention , you are very beautiful .
but still , you know ,
i &apos;d hoped you wouldn &apos;t feel the need to use work
as an excuse to get out of spending time with me .
oh , no , no , no , no , i wasn &apos;t .
i enjoy spending time with you ...
oh . so much .
it &apos;s just , i ...
i guess , i j--i just think of you more as a friend .
friends . you know , we &apos;re--
we &apos;re friends .
but that &apos;s the thing , you know ?
i never wanted to be just your friend .
good night , dr. kepner .
you needed to score a 26 or below
to meet the criteria of the trial .
you were above that .
well , what is it ?
it &apos;s not important--
derek .
it &apos;s 27 .
one point ?
you &apos;re going to deny her this because of one point ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
sorry ? no . it &apos;s good . it means i passed .
i @-@ i &apos;m not sick .
i told you , richard .
that &apos;s not what it means .
you have alzheimer &apos;s .
it just hasn &apos;t progressed enough to get into the trial .
but derek said i passed .
i passed .
meredith ...
i &apos;m okay , right ?
when i asked you to repeat the three words back to me ,
you said &quot; pool &quot; instead of &quot; spoon . &quot;
i asked you to identify my stethoscope .
it took you a while to find the word .
and i asked you where you took your honeymoon ,
and you said hawaii .
but you were here ,
because the chief was a medical student ,
and he had to work .
you &apos;re just a resident . what do you know ?
what the hell do any of you know ?
you work in a hospital all day
around sick people and disease .
you &apos;re obsessed . that &apos;s what this is .
so i got a few answers wrong .
that &apos;s all ?
it &apos;s normal to forget things at my age .
i ...
you can never remember where you parked the car
whenever we go to the movies ,
and they &apos;re not saying that you have ...
it &apos;s not fair .
i finally ...
it &apos;s ...
we &apos;re finally happy ...
you and me--
loving each other the way we should have all these years .
and now ?
it &apos;s not fair !
don &apos;t look at me like that--
like-- like i &apos;m damaged goods .
i @-@ i &apos;m still me . i &apos;m still here .
i &apos;m still me . i ...
maybe--maybe i won &apos;t be here much longer ,
but i &apos;m right here , baby .
i &apos;m right here .
you do-- i &apos;m so scared .
richard .
help me . please . i &apos;m so scared .
you can help me .
please . please . please .
i &apos;m here .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
i &apos;m here .
clara green &apos;s extubated .
her sats are 100 % ,
and her glucose levels are stable .
no organ damage . it &apos;s working , chief .
it &apos;s working .
well , good , &apos; cause i just talked to the fda .
they gave us a waiver .
i just heard the waiver came through .
we did it , right ? you know , a good chief resident would be--
you need to pick a chief resident already .
i mean , alex karev is living in a trailer
in the hospital parking lot .
residents are waiting for you outside bathrooms--
karev &apos;s living in the parking lot ?
you know , your trial is up and running ,
and you &apos;ve got things to deal with at home .
you don &apos;t need to be picking a new chief resident , too .
let somebody else handle that .
delegate .
okay . i &apos;d like you to--
no . i raised those babies .
um , what i mean is , delegate to someone else ,
who is not me .
good night , dr. bailey .
good night .
and , sir ... congratulations on the surgery .
it was a clean excision , and we got clean margins .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
so what i said before ...
about your eyes ?
it wasn &apos;t just the painkillers .
henry , you gotta stop .
you gotta stop talking to me about my eyes
and flirting with me
in front of other doctors .
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
okay .
okay . i &apos;m not sorry .
i meant what i said .
all of it ...
if not more .
i get it .
it &apos;s a great story .
we get married to save your life ,
then we fall in love--
i mean , how romantic is that ?
not to mention that you are ...
smart and funny
and not at all hard on the eyes .
and i would be lying
to say that it &apos;s never crossed my mind .
but i @-@ i don &apos;t feel it .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not real .
it &apos;s just a good story .
what &apos;s so wrong with a good story ?
i &apos;m sorry .
did you hear back from the patient
on the waiting list ?
i haven &apos;t called yet .
maybe richard &apos;s right . it &apos;s just one point .
but it &apos;s a point that could ruin the trial for everyone else
that we &apos;re trying to save .
call them .
well , i heard the good news .
our patient &apos;s doing well .
sorry . your patient , doctor .
oh , eli . i &apos;m tired .
good .
then just admit i was right so we can kiss and make up .
not that tired .
miranda bailey , we are not inside the hospital .
inside the hospital , you &apos;re the man .
that &apos;s the protocol . but outside , i &apos;m the man .
i am the man . me .
now you can call me cro @-@ magnon or old @-@ fashioned ,
but that is not going to stop me
from taking you home to my bed tonight
and showing you what kind of man i am .
now how &apos;s that ? does that protocol suit you ?
yeah .
good .
be at my place in 15 .
this is your new place .
you hungry ? i got , uh , crab cakes ,
uh , cucumber sandwiches .
you ate all the pigs in a blanket , so ...
i &apos;ll take a beer .
so this was your plan--
wait for me on the stoop of your trailer you squat in ?
what ?
you were waiting for me ,
&apos;cause you find me charming .
hot ?
what ? no , i , uh , i was just--
and now you &apos;re stuttering because i intimidate you .
whatever .
which explains it , really .
why you haven &apos;t made a move this whole time .
oh , that &apos;s complete bull .
and now ...
you &apos;re forcing me to do it .
so was i right ?
do you mind ?
nope .
although , if it were me , and i had someone to make out with ,
i might want to do it in private , like in a room ,
where there &apos;s a door that locks .
okay . let &apos;s go upstairs .
it &apos;s every doctor &apos;s dilemma--
do you play it safe and follow protocol ...
yep . actual real dinner .
in honor of me rocking my surgery today .
if webber doesn &apos;t pick me for chief resident ,
he &apos;s an idiot .
... or take a risk and invent a new one ?
cristina .
yes , darling ?
richard just asked me to take over
picking the chief resident .
oh , my god . this is awesome .
you can ...
oh , my god . this is-- this sucks . this sucks .
you can &apos;t-- you can &apos;t pick me .
everyone &apos;s gonna say it &apos;s &apos; cause you &apos;re my husband .
this ... no ! no ! what ? oh , no .
this is--what ? oh , god . how can you eat ? !
this is not fair ! wait . wait . wait . no .
no , no , this--no .
there can be reward in risk .
there can also be fallout .
we &apos;ve been gone all of ten minutes .
what could mark possibly want ?
i don &apos;t know .
oh , y--okay . this is-- this is bad .
he found out lexie &apos;s with avery . he &apos;s freaking .
watch this .
ah--oh , what the hell ?
just let go .
what ? this is--this is--this is time for us . it &apos;s just for us .
and the first thing that you want
to do is talk to mark , so--
you just said it was okay .
okay . all right . you know what ?
screw it . no , i am gonna--
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m gonna talk to him !
don &apos;t you dare call him . i ...
this is jealousy , arizona . you are jealous of mark .
get over it . well ,
do you-- do you blame me ?
i mean , he gets most of you--
the straight you , the--the catholic you ,
the girl who loves baby showers .
i just get , you know , the gay you ... oh .
which is really only about 20 minutes a night , and not even ,
since you just feel too fat to even let me touch you lately .
look , i am doing my best here to make sure that you are happy
and that mark &apos;s happy and that the tiny person
growing inside me is happy .
i don &apos;t know what else i can do , to be honest .
please tell me , &apos; cause i &apos;ll do it .
whatever will make you happy , i will do it .
still , you need to buck the system
every once in a while .
bet big .
marry me .
what ?
i @-@ i mean it .
i love you more than ... anything .
but i want more .
i want commitments . i want rings .
so ...
marry me .
and when you get the results you want ?
there &apos;s no better feeling in the world .
