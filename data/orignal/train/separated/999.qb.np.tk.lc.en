tom and lynette drifted further apart ,
and jane took advantage .
i &apos;m scared .
roy helped karen face her cancer .
we &apos;re done .
i &apos;m the one that decides when we &apos;re done .
the loan shark threatened renee .
but mike stepped in .
i don &apos;t ever wanna see you again .
then you shoulda killed me .
bree discovered the truth about orson ...
you wrote the letters ? you killed chuck ?
and cut off all contact with him .
don &apos;t you ever call my house again .
i can assure you this is the last you &apos;ll hear from me .
but orson had the last word .
in our neighborhood ,
there are people we see every day ,
and every day , we take them for granted .
as we go about our lives ,
we may be busy with a mundane task
and miss one another completely .
or we might give a polite wave ,
only to return to what we were doing .
one minute , we &apos;re spending time with a loved one ...
and the next , we &apos;re wrapped up in our work .
or preoccupied with our own problems .
what a shame these neighbors
take each other for granted ...
because in just a few days ...
one of these people will be dead .
that afternoon , old friends got together
to share coffee and gossip and to discover ...
is there a cup for me ?
that they were still old friends after all .
so orson was behind everything--
chuck , the letters ?
do you know why he did it ?
he thought the only way he could have me to himself
was by tearing me away from you three .
well , guess what ? he failed .
that &apos;s right , because we are still here for you .
and no psycho @-@ on @-@ wheels is gonna change that .
and i &apos;ll tell you something else .
he &apos;d better not show his face around here ever again .
what &apos;s wrong ?
the last time i spoke to orson ,
he ... intimated that he would take his own life .
oh , sweetie .
and i should have done something .
i should have made him tell me where he was
and gone to him .
why ? so he could torture you some more ?
i know what he &apos;s become , but you all know
there was a time when i loved that man very much .
well , he &apos;s not that man anymore .
okay , have we been sad long enough ?
because i &apos;d just like to point something out .
we are finally in the clear .
she &apos;s right . the letters were the last question mark left .
so maybe now we can get back to normal .
yes . our nightmare is finally over .
thanks .
is everything all right over here ?
doctors--they should learn how to talk to people .
i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t understand .
we just got back from my appointment .
looks like the cancer &apos;s spreading faster than anyone thought .
oh , karen .
yep . he gave me
the ol &apos; &quot; put your affairs in order &quot; speech .
only not that nice .
these are people these doctors are talking to ,
not just some name on a chart .
they can all go to hell !
i &apos;m so sorry .
he &apos;s just pissed at the world .
oh , i &apos;ve got it . i &apos;ve got it .
how about you ?
i can &apos;t even imagine what you &apos;re going through .
i &apos;m really gonna miss the christmas festival .
the lane looks so pretty when the lights are , you know ...
karen ...
if there &apos;s anything i can do for you ...
i mean it . anything .
yeah . thanks , bree .
come in !
wow ! the place looks great .
you are going all out .
ever since porter &apos;s big announcement ,
i have a new policy for all our kids .
if you can resist procreating ,
i will throw you a bitchin &apos; party .
well , i just--
i wanted to drop off penny &apos;s present , so ...
champagne ? isn &apos;t that taking the bitchin &apos; party idea
a little too far ?
that is for you .
you went through 22 hours of labor with her .
seems like you should get to celebrate , too .
that is so thoughtful .
uncharacteristically thoughtful , and now that i think about it ,
you could have brought penny &apos;s present to the party ,
so , um ...
what &apos;s going on ?
okay , um ... i was just wondering ...
if you wouldn &apos;t mind ...
maybe we should open that champagne now .
just say it .
i @-@ i want to bring jane to penny &apos;s party .
oh , god .
look , i know it &apos;s a little awkward .
bringing a date to your daughter &apos;s birthday party
when you &apos;re still married ?
yeah , it &apos;s a little awkward . this is a family event .
i know , but jane is part of my life now .
yeah . your life .
i &apos;m sorry , lynette , but ...
i really want to start including jane in some of these things .
why ?
well--
dad !
hey , you .
is that for me ? ahem .
can i open it ?
hey , i know this trick , and if i let you open it today ,
you are gonna guilt me into buying you another one
on your actual birthday .
that &apos;s totally what i &apos;m going to do .
and i am totally gonna fall for it .
what ...
didn &apos;t you wanna finish our conversation ?
another time . just enjoy the champagne .
you had to get the girls a cat , didn &apos;t you ?
even though you know i &apos;m allergic .
oh , you say you &apos;re allergic to everything you don &apos;t like--
cats , raisins , the vacuum cleaner .
hey , that is medically verified .
girls , show mommy how sad we &apos;d be
if she made us give back rufus ?
oh , how could i say &quot; no &quot; to such sad
and obviously rehearsed faces ?
daddy , you wanna see him do a trick ?
kitty , fetch .
now come back .
rufus ?
he kinda does whatever he wants .
well , he should fit right in around here .
i &apos;m not the one who just brought kitty litter into our lives .
look ... if the cat makes them happy ,
then it makes me happy .
one thing i realized in rehab--
there is nothing more important to me
than taking care of you guys .
i love you for that .
ah ! before i forget ,
i got you a present .
a tie .
it &apos;s for your first day back at work after rehab .
something that says , &quot; i &apos;m sober , i &apos;m stylish ,
and my wife has excellent taste . &quot;
i was having so much fun with you and the girls ,
i ... kinda forgot i have to work tomorrow .
well , you could say &quot; thank you . &quot;
i spent a lot of your money on it .
sorry , babe . thank you .
okay . bedtime for bonzos !
hello there .
thank you for fixing my car today .
i like a man who &apos;s good with his hands .
it &apos;s very sexy .
although i think my engine is still running a little hot .
vroom .
susan , what are you doing ?
the question is ,
&quot; who am i doing ? &quot; the answer is &quot; you . &quot;
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just really beat .
all that hard work really took it out on you , huh ?
well , hey ...
maybe this is something that will relax you .
hello .
is that a gun in your pocket ,
or are you just happy to see me ?
oh , my god . it is a gun .
you &apos;ve got a gun in your pocket ?
susan , don &apos;t freak out .
why do you have a gun ?
sit down .
i have something i need to tell you .
did you mean what you said today ?
karen .
about helping me with anything i need ?
&apos;cause a lot of people say that , but they don &apos;t mean it .
no . no , i meant it .
you sure ? because let &apos;s be honest .
you and i never really liked each other .
we haven &apos;t ?
no .
well , i definitely meant what i said .
whatever you need , consider it done .
good . i want you to help kill me .
um ... maybe we should talk about this inside .
karen , you can &apos;t seriously be considering this .
listen , cancer &apos;s a bully ,
and when it &apos;s as bad as mine ,
it laughs at our pathetic little attempts to fight it .
so here &apos;s how i win--
by making sure that i &apos;m the one
that says when and how i go .
so ... will you help me ?
what does roy think ?
well , roy was the first one i went to .
he couldn &apos;t do it . too much of a marshmallow .
i need someone cold and heartless .
and that &apos;s me ?
a dying woman &apos;s sitting in front of you ,
and you haven &apos;t even offered a cup of coffee .
what does that tell ya ?
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know if i could do that .
i don &apos;t want to die alone , bree .
and the chemo &apos;s just kicking my ass .
i don &apos;t want to waste away in some hospital bed .
please help me go the way i want to .
all right .
i &apos;ll help you .
sorry to keep you waiting , mr. and mrs. delfino .
what can i do for you ?
my husband did something really stupid ,
and now we need police protection .
susan , please , just let me handle this .
and by &quot; handle this , &quot; he means ,
&quot; stare out the window with a gun in his pants . &quot;
could you ... start from the beginning , please ?
a buddy of mine-- and i &apos;m not telling you who--
borrowed some money from a loan shark ,
and things got a little out of hand ,
and i had to help him out .
oh , and by &quot; help him out , &quot; he means
&quot; beat up a mob guy ,
putting our whole family in danger . &quot;
does your friend know it &apos;s illegal
to use the services of a loan shark ?
he does .
do you know it &apos;s illegal to assault someone ?
the guy was breaking into our neighbor &apos;s house .
i tried to get him to leave , he threw a punch ,
and i defended myself .
and now this lowlife wants to kill my husband ,
so you need to arrest him .
well , if you had called us
after he broke into your neighbor &apos;s house ,
maybe we could have .
oh . so it would have been smarter to call the cops
instead of slapping jimmy knuckles
around the living room .
where have i heard that before ?
oh , that &apos;s right-- from me .
what &apos;s this about a gun ?
do you have a permit for a gun , sir ?
all right , detective , i think we &apos;re wasting your time .
i can take care of this .
no , mike . you &apos;ve been taking care of it ,
and look where it got us .
we have a 9 @-@ year @-@ old son .
okay . okay , look , here &apos;s what i can do .
we have your address .
i &apos;ll make sure the patrol car keeps an eye on things .
and if you see this guy , call us .
wait . that &apos;s it ?
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s all we can do
until something else happens .
great . well , maybe we &apos;ll get lucky ,
and something else will happen .
honey , there &apos;s fresh coffee .
you want me to put some in a travel mug ?
okay .
what &apos;s wrong ?
30 days with the rehab hippies ,
and you &apos;ve already forgotten how to tie a tie ?
i &apos;ve just been thinking .
i &apos;ve worn a tie every day for 25 years ,
and i &apos;ve always hated the way it feels around my neck .
so ? i wear lots of uncomfortable things--
high @-@ heeled shoes , bras that mash my boobs together .
i &apos;m starting to think that a tie
is basically just a fancy noose .
oh , honey .
you &apos;re not nervous about your first day back , are you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i just thought i &apos;d be more excited than i am .
well , you &apos;re the boss .
you want excitement , shake things up .
buy a new xerox machine
or get some post @-@ its in crazy colors .
take the staff to happy hoho . get stinking drunk .
okay , maybe not the stinking drunk part ,
but you know what i mean .
i gotta get the girls to school .
see you tonight .
i &apos;m just saying , you didn &apos;t have to
fight that woman over a pair of boots .
i saw &apos; em first .
on her feet .
sorry . i shop new york style .
until someone is either bruised or bleeding ,
no sale is final .
hello ?
oh , hi , karen .
no . no , now is not a good time .
uh , renee &apos;s visiting .
well , uh , i &apos;m open tomorrow .
perhaps i could euthanize you in the morning .
great . i will see you then .
so i couldn &apos;t help but overhear .
it &apos;s karen . her cancer &apos;s spreading .
oh , no .
yeah .
she &apos;s ... depressed and ...
wants me to help her die with dignity .
oh , my god . are you gonna do it ?
of course not .
she just got devastating news .
she &apos;s in a state of shock .
i &apos;m just trying to string her along
and buy some time until she &apos;s thinking clearly again .
think that &apos;ll work ?
it &apos;s got to .
by the way , to help her keep her mind off it ,
i &apos;m having people stop by and have tea ,
you know , play scrabble with her ,
maybe give her a foot massage .
do you think tomorrow maybe you could stop by and--
bree , if i touch that woman &apos;s feet ,
you &apos;re gonna have to euthanize me .
billy , where are you ?
oh , look , look ! there &apos;s a gold ! come on ! the gold !
mom ?
yeah ?
this party is amazing . thank you so much !
oh , i just wanted your birthday to be perfect .
happy birthday , penny .
then again , nothing &apos;s perfect .
hey , jane . tom went to pick up the cake ,
so if you wanna wait in the car or ...
oh ! i didn &apos;t know you were bringing a guest .
actually , this is my gift for penny .
a geisha ?
my niece cindy . she &apos;s a photographer .
hi . nice to meet you .
she &apos;s gonna take pictures of the party ,
and then i &apos;m gonna make a little memory book .
cool !
i knew you would love it .
come here .
funny faces .
perfect .
can i talk to you for a second ?
okay .
what are you doing ?
just making sure i &apos;m in the memory book .
you &apos;re invading every photo that penny and i are in .
i &apos;m her mother . maybe you &apos;re the invader .
and we &apos;re back to this .
i spent weeks planning this party ,
making it perfect for her , and then you come in
and upstage me ?
i &apos;m just trying to forge a relationship with penny .
well , stop forging . you &apos;re not family .
you &apos;re just some woman her father is ...
&quot; seeing . &quot;
well ...
&quot; well , &quot; what ?
well ...
that &apos;s not all i am .
what does that mean ?
you know , you should probably talk to tom .
tom &apos;s not here , so why don &apos;t you tell me
what the hell you &apos;re talking about ?
okay .
i really didn &apos;t want you to hear this from me ,
but since you &apos;re insisting ...
tom asked me to move in with him .
so now you know .
sorry !
the cake took longer than i thought .
what ?
this is how i find out
you and jane are going to live together ? from her ?
oh , no , no , no , no . she wasn &apos;t supposed to say anything .
well , she didn &apos;t get the memo because she did say something
in my house--the house you and i lived in .
i didn &apos;t deserve that .
i am so sorry , lynette .
i really need to put this cake down .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i tried the other day ,
but penny wanted to open her present ,
and i didn &apos;t want to ruin her birthday .
god , tom .
you &apos;ve only known her three months .
we were talking about the future ,
and living together is the next step .
oh , you &apos;re talking about steps now ?
jeez , i wonder what the step after that could be .
we haven &apos;t talked about that .
that &apos;s good ,
since you and i aren &apos;t even divorced yet .
i know .
i thought maybe we should talk to a lawyer or something
this week .
really ?
i thought this was a trial separation ,
to see how we did apart , to see if we could be happy .
that &apos;s the thing .
i am happy .
and if you &apos;re not , i &apos;m really sorry .
can i get a picture of mom and dad ?
karen , what in the world are you doing ? !
i lost a contact .
oh , my god . you were hoping i would run you over .
well , what choice do i have ? you said you &apos;d help me ,
and then you keep blowing me off .
now are you gonna kill me today or what ?
no , i cannot kill you today .
i have pilates .
you know , bree , it sounds like we &apos;re just playing games .
karen , i really wanna do this .
i mean , i don &apos;t want to , but ...
let &apos;s go for tomorrow .
no excuses .
really ?
really .
&apos;cause i &apos;m serious about doing this--
with or without you .
hello ?
mrs. solis ?
it &apos;s marilyn , your husband &apos;s secretary .
hi , marilyn . why are we whispering ?
i don &apos;t want mr. solis to know i &apos;m calling you .
why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
he &apos;s been acting a little strange ,
and i just really need you to come down here .
he &apos;s coming .
excuse me .
marilyn , what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on ? he &apos;s giving away all our money !
who &apos;s this guy ?
patrick mcdonald , our c.f.o.
do you see all these people ?
a while back , we took over a steel company ,
chopped it up , sold it , made a nice profit .
these are some of the workers who got laid off .
okay , so what are they doing here ?
carlos has taken it upon himself to make things right
by writing each of them a check for $ 50,000 .
uh ... okay .
excuse me .
excuse me .
oh , boy .
he keeps this up ,
and we &apos;ll be bankrupt in a couple of weeks .
uh , mrs. solis ,
i &apos;m a party girl with a taste for young brazilian gentlemen .
i really need this job .
i &apos;m on it .
honey ?
hey , babe , took your advice .
my advice ?
you told me to shake things up ,
so i decided to make work a place i want to be .
hope this helps .
and remember , you can be anything you wanna be .
nothing is out of reach .
what do you say , skip ?
thanks , mister .
honey , this is how you shake things up ?
by giving away all the company money ?
oh , actually , i was afraid that patrick would put a stop payment
so i decided to start using our personal account .
all right , run along , tiny tim .
okay , let &apos;s go .
sweetheart ...
you can be honest with me .
have you been drinking again ?
nope . haven &apos;t had a drink in 34 days .
then why the hell are you acting like a crazy person ? !
you think this is crazy ?
no .
what &apos;s crazy is making a fortune off of other people &apos;s misery
without thinking for one minute how they &apos;re suffering .
what &apos;s crazy is thinking you can find happiness
in a paycheck or behind the wheel of a sports car .
what &apos;s crazy is thinking that
you &apos;re doing something important with your life
just because you &apos;re wearing a tie .
what ?
i &apos;m trying to find ben . he &apos;s not at his house .
is he here ?
no .
what do you need ben for ?
i want him to tell me where that loan shark lives ,
so i can go to his house .
to do what ?
i don &apos;t know . may @-@ maybe i &apos;ll give him some money .
maybe i &apos;ll kill him . i haven &apos;t decided yet .
okay , sweetie , you &apos;re a little worked up .
sit down . i &apos;ll pour you a glass of wine .
no , i have to fix this . i &apos;m terrified .
i haven &apos;t slept in days .
and my husband is walking around our house with a gun .
ooh , sorry .
why are you apologizing ?
mike &apos;s the one who started this mess .
you mean when he stuck his neck out for ben
and protected me ?
is that the mess you &apos;re talking about ?
look , when you &apos;ve been burned by men as often as i have ,
you stop believing in that fairy tale idea
of the guy on the white horse who comes in to save you .
but ... meeting mike
and seeing how he is as a husband
and a father and a friend ,
well ... he got me believing again .
susan ...
he is a good man .
you really think that ?
or are you just trying to calm me down ?
i really think that .
and i really wanna calm you down .
so if i pour this glass of wine ,
will you not go and kill anyone ?
okay .
okay .
bree ! how you doing ? karen &apos;s taking a nap .
actually , it &apos;s you i wanna talk to .
may i come in ?
sure .
mmm ! that pie smells wonderful .
yeah . karen made rhubarb . i don &apos;t know why .
she knows i don &apos;t like it .
how could you not like it ?
it &apos;s the one pie she makes better than i do .
well , may i cut you a slice ?
sure .
what &apos;s going on ?
we have a real problem on our hands .
i can &apos;t believe she asked you to do this .
she doesn &apos;t even like you .
yes , we &apos;ve established that already .
i figured when i said no , that would be the end of it .
no , she seems more determined than ever .
what the hell are you doing ? !
what ?
that &apos;s my suicide pie .
your what ?
i made it to kill myself .
it &apos;s full of sleeping pills and tranquilizers ,
and a bottle of liquid something .
oh , my god . i ate two pieces !
oh , i &apos;m so sorry , bree .
so you wanna go to the hospital or somethin &apos; ?
yes , i wanna go to the hospital !
what were you doing making suicide pies ?
well , if you two would grow a pair and help me out ...
oh , sure , i &apos;m the problem
because i didn &apos;t wanna murder my wife .
can we please continue this in the car ?
in case you &apos;ve forgotten ,
we need to get to the emergency room now !
what are you doing ? you &apos;re going the wrong way .
she can &apos;t make a 3 @-@ point turn .
i can make a 3 @-@ point turn .
this is just easier .
okay , can we just please stay focused
on getting to the hospital ?
and f.y.i.-- your turn signal is on .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna make a left up on oakhurst .
you &apos;re not gonna take the interstate ?
wouldn &apos;t that be faster ?
she can &apos;t merge .
i can merge . the interstate is always jammed .
plus i gotta stop and get gas .
okay , that &apos;s it . stop ! stop the c car !
get out ! i &apos;m driving .
there &apos;s no need to get so nasty .
i have every right to get nasty .
you poisoned me !
making that pie was a stupid thing to do .
you have no idea what i &apos;m going through .
oh , yes , i do .
three months ago , i was this close to killing myself .
it was a quick fix
on a very depressing night .
but in the morning , i realized
it was the most selfish thing i could do .
it &apos;s not the same . you weren &apos;t dying . i am .
i know .
but if you take your life , it &apos;ll ruin the memory
of everything you were before that .
it &apos;s all anyone will remember .
look at roy .
is that what you wanna do to the man who loves you ?
baby , i don &apos;t want you to go before your time .
okay .
i &apos;ll stick around for as long as i can .
ohh , that &apos;s lovely ,
but we still need to get to the emergency room .
oh , for heaven &apos;s sake .
it &apos;s open !
what are you gonna share with me today ?
the results from my colonoscopy ?
my mom died ?
i shouldn &apos;t have said what i did .
it was wrong , and i &apos;m truly sorry .
are those the cheese puffs i brought ?
yeah . i guess nobody liked &apos; em .
well , more for me .
23 years i &apos;ve been married to the man . 23 years .
and then we hit a rough patch , and we stumbled ,
and then he finds you--
i totally get it .
i &apos;m talking !
he finds you ,
and it kind of makes him stop trying to find me again .
and then when someone has to tell me
that you &apos;re moving in together ,
and we both know what that means ,
you do it .
i said i &apos;m sorry .
and it almost sounded sincere .
fine . have it your way .
i only came because tom asked me to apologize .
i don &apos;t care what you think of me .
of course you don &apos;t . you only care about you .
i think you &apos;re sneaky , jane .
i think everything you do , you do on purpose .
i think you couldn &apos;t wait to see the look on my face
when you told me you and tom were moving in together .
i think you actually liked it .
i think you enjoyed it . i @-@ i think--
what the hell ?
i couldn &apos;t breathe !
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i panicked , and i mean ,
n @-@ not all of us are doctors .
i think i &apos;ll go .
hey , murphy .
yeah ?
you better take a look at this .
some crazy stuff in there , huh ?
yeah .
any chance this could be on the level ?
bree van de kamp .
i know her . she &apos;s the one who ripped chuck &apos;s heart out .
i got a feeling about this .
enough of a feeling to go dig up a construction site ?
yeah .
are you sure you looked under your bed ?
i looked everywhere . rufus is lost .
okay . honey , mommy can &apos;t help you right now .
go look in the backyard .
so just you , or did you adopt a bunch of orphans
on your way home ?
come on , carlos . talk to me .
what was that about today ?
do you remember bill ,
that guy from rehab i was always talking about ?
oh , yeah , bill .
he was my counselor ?
oh . yeah . bill .
he told me this story about his dad .
he was a pilot in vietnam ,
and he &apos;d be flying his plane ,
3,000 feet up ,
drop his bombs , go back to base .
it wasn &apos;t until someone sent him a &quot; life &quot; magazine
that he saw the results of his ...
missions .
it ruined him .
what , he didn &apos;t know ?
he was dropping bombs . things were going &quot; boom . &quot;
it was the distance .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing all these years--
dropping bombs from that skyscraper ,
and i can &apos;t keep doing it .
i can &apos;t keep destroying lives for some ...
bottom line .
rufus ! here , kitty , kitty !
so what are you saying , you &apos;re gonna quit your job ?
yes .
oh , my god .
but not until i find a new one .
and what will that be ?
well , i was thinking ...
maybe counseling .
in one week , bill does more good
than i &apos;ve done in my entire life .
yeah , and in one week , you make more money
than bill will make in his entire life .
i &apos;m not saying that we wouldn &apos;t have to cut back .
you know , we may have to do a little downsizing .
whoa ! whoa ! like what ? i need specifics , gandhi .
i don &apos;t know !
it just seems like we have a bunch of stuff
that we don &apos;t need-- big screen tvs , two cars ,
a really big house .
well , you want us to move ?
yeah ! maybe to someplace with a good public school .
uh , now you &apos;re yanking the kids out of private school ,
which they love ,
that &apos;s your solution ?
help ! help !
juanita ?
juanita ?
mommy !
oh , my god !
okay . baby , don &apos;t move !
i &apos;m scared !
it &apos;s okay , sweetie ! daddy &apos;s coming . just hold on .
and don &apos;t look down .
okay , baby ,
you think you can walk slowly over to daddy ?
no . i @-@ i can &apos;t move .
okay , then i &apos;m coming out to get you .
no , wait , carlos ! be careful !
we are gonna take this ...
nice and slow .
okay , just keep your eyes on me .
oh , my god !
it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . i got you . i got you .
juanita &apos;s finally asleep .
she okay ?
yeah , thanks to you .
god , that was so scary .
you know , if anything had happened to her--
it really puts things into perspective , doesn &apos;t it ?
sure does .
reminds you nothing &apos;s more important
than taking care of family .
i could not agree more .
good .
so does this mean you &apos;re giving up all that crazy talk
and going back to work ?
no !
the exact opposite .
it means i &apos;m more aware than ever of what really matters--
giving back .
why do you keep calling it that ?
you &apos;re not giving . you &apos;re taking--
from us , your family .
i don &apos;t know why i thought you &apos;d understand this .
you have always been selfish .
guilty ! i am selfish .
but you knew that when we got married .
that was the deal--
you make the money , i spend it .
and i &apos;m still holding up my end .
gaby , i am miserable at work . i can &apos;t do it anymore .
do you know how many times i thought to myself ,
&quot; i can &apos;t do it anymore &quot; ?
when you were drowning your guilt in booze ,
when you disappeared in rehab ,
but i willed myself to hold this family together
because someone had to !
and guess what ? !
now it is your turn .
i &apos;ve got something to tell you .
oh . you &apos;re still mad , aren &apos;t you ?
no .
you &apos;re a hard guy to stay mad at , mike delfino .
and i think i figured out why .
i figured out what it was about you
that flipped my switch the very first time i met you .
gotta be the rugged good looks .
no . but they didn &apos;t hurt .
okay . so what was it ?
you don &apos;t get scared .
me ?
nah , that &apos;s not true .
no , it is . you don &apos;t get scared .
it &apos;s what everyone thinks when they meet you .
because you always take care of people .
why are you like that ?
uh , my , um ...
my dad beat the crap out of my mom
when i was little .
bad .
i &apos;d hear it happening .
and there wasn &apos;t anything
a 10 @-@ year @-@ old kid could do about it .
so ...
maybe this came from that , and , uh ...
but ... my whole life ...
when i see somebody in trouble ,
i can &apos;t walk away .
but i can tell you something i am scared of .
i get scared that maybe somehow ...
because i &apos;m not the most expressive guy in the world ...
maybe i never made it clear to you
how much i love you .
no .
no , i got that .
i should start dinner .
i thought you said you were gonna fix that fence post .
tomorrow .
ohh , tomorrow .
one more thing .
delfino !
we all take the gift of life
for granted .
if only we could slow things down .
i &apos;m mike delfino .
i just started renting the simms &apos; house next door .
susan mayer . i live across the street .
whatcha doin &apos; ?
locked myself out , naked .
so how are you ?
i &apos;ve never seen you look so beautiful .
he said i &apos;m pregnant .
mike ?
because before you know it ...
the gift is gone .
mike . mike ? oh , god .
mike ! no .
no . mike . no .
no !
mike !
