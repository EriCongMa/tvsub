Thought it was gonna be a good day.
Mr. Gregory had this way of making everyone feel good,
Even when we were painting over graffiti.
Should be good to go.
Give it a good stir first, okay?
Okay.
Dante.
Closest thing I ever had to a father.
Bring that ladder over here.
Okay, Mr. Gregory. Want me to set it up?
Yeah.
But little t...
He didn't like what Mr. Gregory stood for.
Just like that...
No!
...Mr. Gregory was gone.
Is Terrance Jones,
the man you know as little t,
Who you saw shoot Elmore Gregory?
Yeah, that's him.
Can you describe the gun used in the shooting?
It was a mac-10, all black-like, with a big barrel.
Bad-ass gun.
Isn't it true that you were focused on the weapon,
focused on saving yourself?
Yeah, but -- - so focused,
you couldn't possibly see the shooter
Because you were only looking at the gun.
Isn't that true, Mr. Moore?
Trust me. The defense attorney will be worse.
Answer the question, Dante,
just like we practiced.
I saw Terrance Jones kill Elmore Gregory.
It was little T.
Good job. That's all you have to do tomorrow.
I think we're ready for trial.
Good, 'cause I'm starving.
Meet you outside.
Come on. Let's get you to the hotel and get you fed.
Just be yourself on the stand tomorrow, okay, Dante?
That's all you got to do.
You'll be there with me?
The whole time.
Come on.
I want to thank you for being the only guy
with the guts to stand up to little T.
I'm standing up for Mr. Gregory.
It will be very intimidating
When you see Terrance Jones in the courtroom.
I'm buggin' a little.
Little t's homies are looking for me.
Oh, don't worry about it, all right?
They're not gonna find you.
Um, this is officer Jermaine Walker,
And he will be outside your hotel room all night.
How you doing? I'll make sure nothing happens.
You have my word.
All right.
See you tomorrow. Order a steak.
No, no, no, no. Don't.
I'm concerned about promise, reward, and inducement.
The defense attorney could come after us
If we give him anything -- you know that.
you can't lock him in a room
and not give him food.
Just keep it modest.
Order a steak, all right, but a cheap one.
And watch a movie.
For real?
Yeah.
Keep it clean, right?
See you in the morning.
Yeah. Okay.
"Reward and inducement"?
Like Dante's gonna risk his life
to testify for a free steak?
Valerie Delgado is a great prosecutor.
I know, I know. The best there is.
She's never lost a murder trial.
But?
Just wish she'd lighten up a little bit.
Valerie Delgado says your witness is prepped.
Yeah, I think he's good to go, sir.
Keep up the good work.
We all want this guy.
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
Little t is responsible for at least 15 murders.
Remember when we almost got him with the drive-by
of the grandmother and the 8-year-old kid?
That witness "Disappeared"
When Terrance Jones was charged.
Since then, no one has come forward
until Dante stepped up.
So, how does a white female cop
get the confidence of a black kid from the hood?
I have mad skills.
No.
Korsak's the one that got us his fingerprints on the weapon.
No big deal.
Yes, it is!
You're the one who found the C.I.
Who told us that the gun was still in little t's car.
Yeah, we caught a few breaks on this one.
I want to look professional on the stand. Which one?
Hmm. What's that music I'm hearing?
What music?
Oh, it's your ties, singing disco songs.
All right, Armani. What would you wear?
Let's see.
Uh, where's the other one?
The other one?
This is two-for-one from the gentleman's warehouse, right?
God, you know what?
Go away, please.
He's right. I got no sense of style.
Oh, come on. He's just messing with you.
Here. Wear this one.
Goes nice with your eyes.
Thank you.
you are taking forever. Come on.
You haven't touched your mulberry leaves
or the wheatgrass.
Bass, you love your opuntia cactus pads!
Oh! Oh, my god.
you scared me.
I'm so sorry.
I just wanted to watch something on your plasma.
Oh. You're a Bill O'Reilly fan?
He has the most beautiful Irish blue eyes.
I-I hope you don't mind,
But the tv in the guest house just doesn't do them justice.
Well, they look like contacts.
No!
Yeah, Paris Hilton wears them, too.
I didn't think you read tabloids.
Oh, no. I read that in ophthalmological monthjournal.
Yeah. Of course.
So, why is the sound off?
Oh. Mr. O'reilly's very bright but a little opinionated.
And he gets on my nerves when I listen to him.
Well, neurological studies show
that listening to someone you disagree with
helps stimulate the brain.
Oh, I'm stimulated watching him.
oh, turn it up!
This is why I'm watching.
Elmore Gregory was one of the good guys --
a young father of two
who stood up to drug dealers and paid with his life.
Here he is on "The factor" Two years ago.
I say put your xbox down,
get your paint rollers and your courage,
and stand up to these drug dealers...
That's Jane's case.
I know.
Bill O'Reilly's in town to cover it.
Isn't it exciting?
This man, Rerrance "Little T" Jones,
goes on trial tomorrow.
Boston homicide detectives apparently have an eyewitness
who is prepared to identify Jones
as the killer of a good man, a patriot...
Why is your door unlocked?
Hey, Ma -- okay, I couldn't find any sour patch,
so you got to settle with gummi bears.
It's good.
No. No, no, no, no, no. Turn that crap off, ma.
Uh, ane, O'Reilly is doing --
Off, all right?
We all know you're in love with B.O.
Don't call him that.
Off!
Too bad, since he's doing the whole show on your case.
What?
But since you're not interested --
Wait. No. Turn it back on.
Ma, turn it back on!
Now tomorrow
the trial of Terrance Jones begins,
Look, it's you!
And we will be there.
Boston police say he's a suspect
in at least 15 other murders.
Now homicide detectives finally have Jones
right where they want him --
facing a jury for killing a man who stood up to him.
Let's hope there will finally be justice
for this father of two
who wasn't afraid to speak up for what's right.
Wow. Wouldn't that be something?
Yes, it would.
Hey, Ma, can you make me some eggs?
Sure!
Thank you.
I can't believe she has the hots for Bill O'Reilly.
"His irish blue eyes"?
Vomit.
Well, studies show that men with great earning potential
are still the most desirable mate.
She's too old to mate.
Rizzoli!
At least that stops her from falling for Stanley.
How many times I got to tell you?
The jelly doughnuts don't go here.
Oh, I'm sorry, mr. Stanley.
Look at this mess.
You got strawberry jelly on the sprinkles.
Oh, that's a problem.
Stanley has obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The two doughnuts making contact is very upsetting for him.
Good.
Rizzoli.
All right, we'll be right there.
Gang-related shooting. Let's go.
What do we got?
Victim's male, African-american, early 20s.
Gang affiliation?
No one's talking.
Some things never change.
Oh, God. No.
Jane, who is it?
Oh, god.
It's Dante, my witness.
How did he get here? There was a guard right outside his hotel door.
Frost is checking it out.
Little T ordered this hit from jail.
How'd they find him?
I talked him into this, Korsak.
You're not responsible for this.
Yeah, I am.
Rigor indicates he's been dead about eight hours.
So he was killed last night.
One gunshot wound to the back of the head.
It's a close contact, execution style.
Hey. I'm glad you're here. You believe this?
What I can't believe is how you let this happen.
Oh! Nobody let this happen.
Lividity suggests he's been lying here six to eight hours.
Yeah, and yet nobody thought to call it in.
I don't see any blood or brain matter.
He wasn't killed here.
I want an internal affairs investigation
into that officer you put on the hotel room.
Really? You think that's the most important thing right now?
Dante's dead, Valerie.
You vouched for that officer, Jane.
If we're getting technical,
his safety was her responsibility.
Let's not play the blame game.
I just want to find out who did this.
His wallet's still here.
Did you see his phone?
No.
I'll get a subpoena going for his phone records.
Right. I want to take a look at
that hotel room myself and talk to Walker.
Go. I'll handle this.
Can you handle her?
The guy with three ex-wives? Psh!
That's what I thought.
Okay.
I looked at the surveillance tape.
He's telling the truth.
How is that possible?
Walker never left his post.
Dante never left the room.
Front desk says no calls on the room phone,
No card-key activity on the door, just room service.
Did we check the room-service guy?
Clean.
What time was it when you last saw Dante?
Look, he was fine.
I saw him when they brought his dinner.
What time was it?
it was 8:53 p.m.
Look, I come from the same project.
I know what it took
for him to stand up to someone like Little T.
Jermaine, it's okay. Nobody's blaming you for this.
He barely touched his burger.
He was starving. He hadn't eaten all day.
Something big must have interrupted him.
Or someone called him on his cellphone.
He was a foster kid. He bounced from home to home.
No family. So who?
Maybe a friend he trusted.
Who lured him to his death.
No signs of a struggle.
Jermaine, did you open the window?
It was hot when we came into the room.
Dante opened it.
Excuse me. Can you dust the sill for me?
Look at the way the prints are facing.
Looks like the prints are facing outward,
Like he was hanging from the window.
Hmm. You think he climbed out?
I don't know, Jane. It's two stories.
It's a long drop.
Do you see any other way for him to get out of here?
What the hell made him bolt?
What does the loss of your witness do to your case?
It's not good, but we've still got
the gun with Terrance Jones' prints,
and I've never lost a murder trial.
Wow, that's impressive.
Oh, crap. I've got a flat.
Wouldn't be surprised if a gangbanger slashed my tire.
Damn.
Oh, no. It wasn't slashed.
Looks like you ran over a roofing nail.
The last time I called Peppy Road Service,
It took them like four peppy hours.
I'll be here all day.
I'll change it for you.
No. What? You don't have to do that. It's fine.
No, no. It's okay.
Just need to get the right footwear for the job.
You sure you don't want my help?
No, thank you, Sergeant.
I like to keep my skill set fresh.
I feel bad, watching you do it all by yourself.
Don't. She's faster than Peppy.
It's a dicey neighborhood.
You want me to wait around with you?
She can take care of herself.
No, it's fine.
I'll see you back at headquarters.
He really thinks we're incompetent.
No, he doesn't.
He's just, uh, protective.
Why is it men always think that women,
we don't know what the hell we're doing?
Actually, there are exciting advances
in brain mapping and genetic research
that prove some stereotypes are true.
Really? What, like men are better drivers?
Yes. Actually, probably due to testosterone.
Seems they have an advantage in spatial ability.
Okay, don't tell my colleagues that, please.
All right. There you go.
You can drive on the spare,
but you should get a new tire.
Let me ask you -- what's science have to say
about the chances of a woman who can't change her own tire
becoming the next d.A.?
Excellent.
The prints from the window sill belong to Dante.
You started the autopsy?
Just about to.
Oh, yuck.
It's Delgado, asking me again, for the 400th time,
if I've filed a 1920.
I thought I'd memorized all your cop talk.
You know, "Code 10." That's lunch.
And "I'm off for a personal."
That's when you have to do number two.
Stop.
1920 is the internal-affairs complaint form...
...which I'm not filing,
Because Walker had nothing to do with this.
You know, she's very nice if you approach her in the right way.
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but now I think grizzly bears are nicer.
Ursus horribilis.
Grizzly bear. It's a remarkably bad-tempered creature.
It's ursus Delgado.
Again.
More like ursus americanus. Black bears.
But they rarely attack
unless they've had a bad berry year.
But when they do, watch out.
So Delgado had a bad berry year?
She wants to be the D.A.,
so she has to be tough.
Oh, and I was gonna vote for her,
but if she doesn't quit calling me,
she can forget it.
Hi, honey! Did you hear the great news?
North Korea has a new leader?
No. Bill O'Reilly's having a book signing tonight.
Wow. Can't wait.
But Mr. Stanley won't let me leave.
Jane, maybe you could, um, take me later
and badge me to the front of the line?
Have Frankie take you.
Take you where?
Yeah.
It could be payback for
all the Metallica concerts he made you take him to.
You're right. I nearly forgot.
I couldn't hear for three days after that last one.
Noise-induced hearing loss.
Exposure to noise levels over 85 decibels can cause damage.
I missed the beginning of this conversation.
What the hell are we talking about?
Bill O'Reilly is having a book signing,
and ma wants you to take her
so you can badge her to the front of the line.
Oh. No. Have fun.
So...
How much clout does the M.E. have in this town?
Oh, look at the time!
We have so much work to do.
I'll take you.
You will?!
No, Maura. Mnh-mnh-mnh-mnh.
Oh. Bring your badge.
I look forward to it.
Yes!
The last book signing I went to
was "Organ pathology essentials."
And you didn't invite me?
Diameter of the entry wound is 9.1 millimeters.
Puts the bullet in the .38-caliber family.
Cheap gun one of Little T's underlings
wouldn't mind tossing.
Can you help me with his shirt?
Yeah, sure.
He just wanted to be like Elmore Gregory, you know?
Stand up to the bad guy,
make the world a better place.
"Destiny."
A predetermined course of events.
Which led him here.
God, what a waste.
This could be peat moss on the bottom of his shoe.
I'll have the crime lab analyze it.
You're not gonna find any of that
in the projects or at the hotel.
That could tell us where he was killed.
Yeah.
Oh, hello. And how are you?
Maura, you're talking to a shoe.
Crushed husk of arthropod larvae
embedded in his tread.
And an exoskeleton.
So? You found a cockroach.
I'll alert the media.
They're all over the place at the Franklin Street Projects.
Don't assume it's a cockroach.
There are thousands of different arthropods.
I'll consult a forensic entomologist.
He should be able to I.D. the species.
Oh, crap. I got to get to court.
Without my witness.
At least you still have the murder weapon.
Yeah. We'll get him, Maura.
At this time, your honor,
the defense requests a motion to dismiss.
What? He can't do that.
On what grounds, your honor?
The prosecution can't prove its case.
They can no longer produce their witness.
Yeah, because your client killed him!
Hey, I didn't kill no one.
Shh, shh. Shh, shh.
They're trying to frame me is what they're trying to do.
Mr. Wooster, if you don't silence your client,
I will have him removed.
Defense has a good point, counselor.
Your witness is dead.
We plan to present the murder weapon
with the defendant's prints on it, your honor.
Fruit of the poisonous tree, your honor.
Motion to suppress.
No, he can't do that.
That's so ridiculous.
That weapon was lawfully seized
by virtue of a search warrant, your honor.
The defense can show that warrant was issued based upon
a false statement by sergeant Detective Korsak.
What?!
That's enough, detective.
Please explain, Ms. Delgado.
Sergeant Korsak stated
he got the information from a person
known to the commonwealth.
He will be able to produce
his confidential informant to the court.
Sergeant Korsak?
Are you prepared to produce your informant?
No, your honor.
You have two days to think this over, sergeant.
Produce your informant,
or this case is dismissed.
Court is adjourned.
Can't pin no murder on me.
You better produce your C.I.,
or that smug asshole is gonna walk.
I can't, Jane.
I can't.
I have no idea where he is.
I haven't talked to him
since we investigated Gregory's murder.
You'll find him.
He lived off the grid.
I don't even think I had a phone number for him.
I'm gonna hit the street.
It's the only chance I have of finding him.
You want company?
No. Stay here and work Dante's murder.
What?
Unh-unh. Korsak did not make up his informant.
Didn't say that.
You didn't have to.
Your raised eyebrow said it for you.
Don't tell me it hasn't crossed your mind.
Korsak was my partner for years.
There is no way he would break the rules.
Even for a dirtbag like little t?
Korsak's been after him since he came up to homicide.
He finally gets a chance to put him away.
Would you blame him for breaking the rules?
No. And neither would you,
but the justice system would.
I'm gonna go see if Maura has anything.
How's it going?
I'm teaching Frankie about the post-mortem interval
based on... stomach contents.
Everybody's talking about it.
His stomach contents?
I'd do it, too -- fabricate a C.I.
to take down little t.
Oh, hey. Korsak did not make up an informant,
and if you want to work in homicide,
you don't ever let anybody hear you talking like that.
All right?
Okay. Okay. Sorry.
Bad news. Undigested iceberg lettuce.
Oh, gosh. I have to sit down. That terrible news.
It is?
No.
That's just Maura news.
Good news -- undigested ground beef.
I can't tell what grade it is.
Yippee. Can you tell what market it came from?
I'm ignoring you.
Sesame seeds, white bread...
All undigested.
Wait. Dante's food was undige,
that is interesting news.
Why?
Hamburger typically takes two hours to digest.
Means he died less than two hours after he ate?
Very good.
Thin, white coating on his tongue.
It could be oral thrush.
Fabulous find. No, thank you.
It's minty.
Since when is oral thrush minty?
It isn't.
I suspect this may turn out to be residue from a breath mint.
But we didn't find any breath mints in Dante's things.
Which means what, Frankie?
He had bad breath?
Think.
All right?
Dante hadn't eaten all day,
He didn't finish his burger,
so why does he pop a breath mint
right before he's killed?
So, the question is, who gave it to him?
Yes, and where was he that he felt
Comfortable enough to suck on a mint?
Maybe Dante was meeting a chick.
A chick?
He might be right.
I mean, what else or who else could have lured him
out of the safety of that hotel room?
Well, he had no family, no girlfriend,
nobody in his life for little t to intimidate.
Little t's crew used a girl.
That is genius, Frankie.
How do we solve murders without you?
Are you this rude to all your colleagues?
Korsak, any luck?
I'm working on it.
Oh. Got Dante's cellphone records.
Last incoming call -- 8:55.
Two minutes after room service dropped his burger off.
It's from a burn phone.
Can't you trace it?
No. It's all the rage with the gangbangers.
All right. Well, any other calls?
What's this one at 8:30?
Oh! And there it is again.
There it is again. He called it a lot.
It comes back to Relita Washington.
Address is in the Franklin Street projects.
Gee, that sure looks like a chick.
I'm waiting for an apology.
Have a seat. You'll be waiting a long time.
Again with the rude remarks.
That's someone I'd pop a breath mint for.
Relita.
Yes?
I'm detective Rizzoli. This is detective frost.
Can we come in?
Do you know a Dante Moore?
Who?
I don't know who you're talking about.
Well, maybe Destiny does.
We need to talk.
We kept it a secret. We had to.
Dante was too afraid little t would find out.
He was a good guy, Dante.
He loved our baby so much.
You know, that's why he was testifying.
He said he didn't want our daughter growing up
in a world ruled by fear, you know?
When was the last time you spoke to Dante?
Yesterday after he got to the hotel.
He said he was scared,
but there was a cop who was on the door watching him.
Were you supposed to meet him last night?
No. No way.
No, he wasn't leaving that hotel room.
He was too afraid little t's boys would be looking for him.
He wasn't going nowhere,
especially near the projects.
Do you know of anyone he might have talked to,
anyone who could have convinced him to leave?
The only one he really trusted was you.
I wish he'd trusted me enough
to tell me about you and Destiny.
Why? Maybe we'd be dead, then, too.
Nobody could protect him from little t.
We're gonna get him, okay? We will.
Little t's gonna be free, like he always is.
That's not true, all right?
We won't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
104.
I mean, what if we don't get in?
Oh, we'll get in.
It's really a prestigious thing
to be the chief medical examiner
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Thank you.
Can I see your badge?
This would definitely mean an autograph from Mr. O'Reilly.
You just have to... Show...The guy...
Wait. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
I heard he's gonna stop signing soon.
What?
Oh, no! Maura, come on.
Okay. Okay. Come on.
Get in the back of the line.
Commonwealth business.
This is my, uh, coworker.
I can't believe it. It's him!
Hey, you pinheads. You can't cut.
We're patriots on official business, mister.
Hi. What's your name?
Her adrenal glands are over-producing adrenaline.
It dilates the blood vessels and makes it hard to talk.
Fascinating. What's her name?
Angela. Angela Rizzoli.
Thank you, Madeline.
With two z's.
Is this beautiful young lady your daughter?
Yes. This is Madeline.
Oh, I have a daughter, too. Her name is Jane.
Detective Jane Rizzoli?
Yes, of -- of course you know her.
You're covering her case.
I'd love to get her on "The factor."
Oh, I'm sure she would love to be your guest.
Excellent.
Let me give you her cellphone number.
Angela.
It's 617...
No.
555...
30...
Excuse me.
Here's what doesn't make sense --
Dante told Relita he's staying put.
Then he gets a call from a burn phone,
and he jumps out a window.
Rizzoli.
Oh! Very funny.
Who's that?
Said it was Bill O'Reilly.
For the love of pete.
You call me again,
I'll arrest you for harassing a police officer.
I said forget it!
I'd love to, sergeant, but if I "Forget it,"
a murderer walks.
How about you do what you've been ordered to do?
That doesn't sound good.
Okay, read my lips --
I don't know where my C.I. is.
Is that clear enough for you?
Hey, show some respect, sergeant.
Ms. Delgado's just trying to do her job,
which is more than I can say for you.
The judge has ordered you to present the informant.
I want his name, and I want it now.
Vince, you got to give her the name,
even if you don't know where he is.
No. All the judge said was "Bring him to court."
I can't.
We call it a "Confidential informant" for a reason!
Where's your paperwork for this C.I.?
Oh, my god.
You did make him up, didn't you?
It's not the judge you have to worry about now, sergeant.
It's me. I'll see you go to prison for this.
Either give me a name or give me your badge.
Boston homicide detectives unlocked the jail door
and let a drug-dealing murderer back out onto the street.
That's an outrage.
And it makes me wonder,
are they corrupt, too?
Oh, my god.
The cops get their young witness, Dante Moore,
murdered while in their custody.
But that's not all.
Sources now tell me sergeant detective Vince Korsak,
lead investigator on the case,
even fabricated a confidential informant.
So it looks like not only is their case gone...
Please turn it off.
...But respect for the entire Boston --
I want to be alone.
Too bad.
I know how long you've wanted little T.
Vince, we all know that.
Everything O'Reily said about me is true.
It just...
Isn't the truth.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I've known you a long time, Vince Korsak.
And I know you're holding something back.
You know where your C.I. is.
You've known the entire time.
You can't go down for this, Vince.
We've already lost one witness.
I can't guarantee his safety.
Think about the safety of all the Dantes
And all the Elmore Gregorys in the world.
15 murders little T is responsible for.
15.
Tell me the name of your C.I.
Please.
I can't.
I don't agree with you,
but I respect what you're doing.
Come on. I'll take you home.
Leave me alone, Jane.
Okay.
What are you doing?
He's not going down for this -- not on my watch.
Korsak's too careful.
Even if the C.I. does exist,
you said Cavanaugh couldn't find a name in his file.
Well, here's what we know --
the informant is listed as
"A person known to the commonwealth."
That means the informant is not a criminal.
So his C.I. didn't give up the location of the gun
in exchange for a reduced sentence.
So that leaves money, payback, or...
a person doing a good deed.
Go up against little T and tell a cop
where the murder weapon is?
That's a hell of a good deed.
He interviewed hundreds of people.
Yeah.
So...exclude any name with an address...
or a follow-up interview.
Not following you.
Korsak's protecting this informant.
That means, the only thing we're gonna find
is a name, all by itself --
that'll be the giveaway.
And that's the name of the informant.
You have mad skills.
Frost, I got it.
I got a name.
You sure?
Damn, I think you're right.
Where you going?
To convince the C.I. to do the right thing.
Not without backup.
Little T's already back in charge here.
The elevators are out.
He's saying this is his turf.
Yo, sister five-o.
What you comin' up here for? To be my shortie?
Step away, punk-ass bitch!
"Bitch" was a nice touch.
Wasn't too much?
No, no, no. It was nice. I liked it.
Okay.
Never tell Korsak this, but...
I always admired the guy.
Because he'd rather lose everything that he's worked for
than take a chance that somebody'd hurt his C.I.?
Yeah.
Hi, Relita.
Can we come in?
My head feels like an anvil dropped on it.
This better be good.
It is.
What the hell?
Your confidential informant
doesn't really look like a "He," Korsak.
Hi, sergeant.
You don't have to do this, Relita.
Relita understands that Dante sacrificed his life
so his daughter wouldn't have to grow up
around the same violence that he did.
Detective Rizzoli told me what you were willing to do.
I have to do this.
For you, for Dante.
But mostly for Destiny.
Thank you.
Thank Detective Rizzoli.
I wouldn't have come forward without her.
I forgot some files I need to pick up at work.
There are two uniforms outside the apartment.
Don't take your eyes off her.
I'll see you at the hearing at 2:00?
Yeah.
Did you tell Delgado?
No.
I saved that for you.
Hello, Stanley.
Hello, Rizzoli.
That's nice. Have you two become friends?
Mm-hmm. Watch this.
Stanley.
The ketchup top is making contact
with the napkin dispenser.
What are you doing? Don't do that.
I'm sorry.
I'm not sorry.
Detective Rizzoli?
Yeah?
You hung up on me.
I did?
That was really you?
Both times.
How did you get my number?
You need to come on "The Factor,"
Talk about the story -- it's important.
I've got nothing to say to you. You, either.
I respect police work more than any other profession.
Oh, yeah. I can tell by the hatchet job you did on my partner.
If we made a mistake,
come on the program, set the record straight.
I don't think you should, Jane.
You can be a very mean man.
You weren't very nice to Barney Frank.
Although I did think it was rude when he called you boorish.
Appreciate it.
Oh. I'm sorry. This is urgent. It's about arthropods.
My grandfather, John O'Reilly --
member of the NYPD in the 1930s.
I still have his billy club.
Well, keep it away from your detractors.
Jane.
Yeah.
I got to show you something important.
Okay.
If you'll excuse me,
I have murders to solve.
Detective, Elmore Gregory was a great man.
No one wants to see Terrance Jones get away with his murder.
Come on the program.
Maybe somebody will see it,
come forward with information.
It could help.
No, thanks.
I'm sorry I called you mean.
You're not nearly as awful in person.
Thank you.
I know a really nice Italian restaurant
in the north end, and I get off early today.
I cannot believe she just said that.
The foremost expert in forensic entomology
identified the larva on Dante's shoe.
What am I looking at?
The Asian longhorn beetle.
It's an exotic pest.
Do you realize what a big break this is?
No, but I didn't spend my life playing with bug larva.
There has been a recent infestation of the Asian longhorn.
Please don't tell me that they're marching to my apartment.
They're only found in this one area -- Loyalist Park.
Wait, are you saying that Dante
could have been killed in this park?
Oh, no -- I'm only able to conclusively say
that Dante's shoes were in Loyalist Park
the night he was murdered.
Okay, you know what?
You are officially ridiculous.
His shoes didn't go there by themselves. Come on, Maura!
Even you have to admit this looks like blood.
It is a reddish-brown substance consistent with blood.
Big concession. Thank you very much.
Okay. What about this?
This brain matter right here.
It appears to be human tissue.
I think we just found the spot where Dante was killed.
Jane.
Yes?
Found some fresh tire tracks.
Okay. Can you make a cast of the tire impressions?
Copy that. I'll get CSRU on it.
Jane, it's a right rear tire.
Can you tell me the manufacturer?
Road ready.
Well, that's not gonna help. It's too common.
This impression -- it's from a nail.
And it's from a roofing nail.
You have a funny look on your face.
I feel a little bit sick.
I recognize this tire tread.
Where's Ms. Washington?
I don't have much time to prep her.
She's changing her baby's diaper.
Well, tell her to leave the baby and come with me.
You didn't change your spare tire.
I've been a little busy.
But that is your car, isn't it, counselor?
What are they doing?
Why are they in my car?
Your flat tire.
We found the same tire tread
in the place where Dante was murdered.
It's like finding a fingerprint.
Oh, hey. Korsak.
That's a .38 revolver, isn't it?
Yeah. .38.
Stupid to leave it in your car.
You learn that from little T?
Okay, I, um...
I will testify against Mr. Jones.
He's the one who set this whole thing up.
That's who you want.
What did you say to Dante on the burned phone
to get him to jump two stories?
I told him...
I told him, um,
the officer outside his door was -- was dirty.
And I drove him to the woods.
And you shot him.
Please. Please. Please, I will give you little T.
You won't ever get him without me.
I went through your case files.
You've never lost a case.
Nobody's that good, counselor.
Unless they have Terrance Jones in their pocket.
He gave you everything you needed to win those cases --
witnesses, evidence, anybody you needed to disappear.
And all you had to do was bag any case against him.
Put your hands behind your back.
You are under arrest for the murder of Dante Moore.
We have a deal!
There's not gonna be any deal.
You cannot bring him down unless I testify!
We don't need you. We've got my C.I.
I want a lawyer.
I hope you know someone who's better at it than you are.
You sure you don't want a little hair of the dog?
No, my head's still pounding.
Valerie Delgado, the assistant district attorney
who was arrested today for the murder of Dante Moore,
will be arraigned tomorrow,
all thanks to the work of two of Boston's finest,
Detective Jane Rizzoli
and Sergeant Detective Vincent Korsak.
He's really very nice.
You'll remember these two
initially arrested drug dealer Terrance Jones...
Look, everybody! That's my daughter, Jane!
...who is accused of murdering
community activist Elmore Gregory.
A new prosecutor has been assigned to the case.
In the meantime...
O'reilly's really not that bad.
My mother, on the other hand...
Are you telling me you like him?
Wha -- I am so gonna tell your mother.
Tell me what?
That you need a new hangout.
Did you get your badge back?
Yeah.
Nice.
You know, uh, Angela really likes badges.
She does?
I do.
Don't you call them "badge bunnies"?
I guess that makes me one.
Oh, my god. I cannot believe --
Do you even know what that means?
Thank you, Maura. Thank you very, very much.
What? What did I do?
You know, I think you just bruised
my extensor hallucis longus.
Good.
I don't even know what that is.
What?
