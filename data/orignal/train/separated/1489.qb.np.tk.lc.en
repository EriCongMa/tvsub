i have to show a house today ,
so see you guys at luke &apos;s football games .
i &apos;m too tired to go .
i have a midterm tomorrow
which i &apos;ll probably fail . and i was up really late studying .
she was . i was up really late doing this .
don &apos;t even bother coming . i &apos;m quitting today .
i &apos;m sick of this guy in the team always making fun of me .
he &apos;s just jealous because
you &apos;re the one who puts points on the board .
why ?
because you run the scoreboard .
... run the scoreboard .
i &apos;m out , too .
but all your classmates will be there .
we ignore each other all week .
it &apos;s nice to have a little break on the weekends .
geez , i &apos;ve never seen such a bunch of no @-@ getters .
coined it !
remember , keep a positive attitude ,
and good things will happen .
two things i bring to every open house --
my lucky pen and a smile .
i haven &apos;t sold a house all month .
do you see me saying &quot; i &apos;m done &quot; ? never .
because there is no &quot; done &quot; in dunphy .
i &apos;ll see you guys at the game .
hey , there is no &quot; umph &quot; in dunph--
different spelling !
cam !
yes , phil , i remember your special play ,
but i think the triple gull @-@ wing is a little tricky
to run at such an important sporting match .
cam has a number of delightful superstitions
during the football season .
well , they &apos;re not superstitions when they work .
that seems science @-@ y .
not sorry that today is the last g @-@ a @-@ m @-@ e .
well , thank you , but good coaches don &apos;t need luck .
we make luck .
see you at the athletic endeavor .
i &apos;m going to call gloria
and see if she can pick up lily , too ,
you know , just in case ...
what , you procrastinate again
and not tell charlie you &apos;re quitting ?
no , no ! i &apos;m gonna do it .
i just -- i &apos;m picturing his face when i tell him ,
shaking his head in disappointment .
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s hard .
hey , just do it !
no .
i don &apos;t know why you &apos;re making yourself so crazy over this .
you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right .
i -- i do not want to be crazy .
i &apos;ll see you at the game .
hey , gloria .
yes , mitch , i will pick her up .
thank you so much ! all right . bye , lily .
good luck with the whole patrick situation .
dad , you &apos;re embarrassing me .
well , welcome to the rest of your life , sweetheart .
so , lily , tell me more about this patrick .
he likes the swings , he sits by the flag ,
and he can count to 100 .
he sounds like the whole package .
then what is the problem ?
he doesn &apos;t notice me .
so then make him notice you .
you don &apos;t want to wake up one morning
as a lonely 9 @-@ year @-@ old ,
wondering where all the time went .
hey , mom . if you &apos;re at the store later ,
could you pick up some ice ?
i &apos;m gonna need it for after the game .
my little athlete .
i want to try out the gelato maker i traded my bike for .
lures me in every time .
oh , okay . bye .
dad , you can just drop me at the next light .
i can walk from there ,
and i got to call phil anyway .
you did the same thing yesterday .
why ? what &apos;s going on with you ?
you smoking again ?
no ! no .
i just -- i don &apos;t want to put a spotlight
on the fact that i &apos;m the boss &apos;s daughter .
it makes people resent me .
this is good . thanks , dad .
yeah .
bye .
bye .
i can see that bothers you .
well , yeah , your own kid ,
embarrassed to be seen with you ,
you know what i mean ?
you spend your whole life ...
here &apos;s fine .
last month , a law @-@ school classmate offered me a job
at his legal aid society ,
and i just knew i had to take it .
and i explained that in a letter
that i was going to sneak onto charlie &apos;s desk .
oh , good . it &apos;s you .
did you sleep here ?
my girlfriend dumped me , uh , in an e @-@ mail .
couldn &apos;t even do it face @-@ to @-@ face .
pretty gutless , huh ?
oh , you should go home , get some rest .
i can &apos;t go back there . it would be too hard .
mm , too many memories ?
no , we were living on my boat .
i don &apos;t know where she took it .
enough of my whining . what do you need ?
oh , well , i just -- i just came by to say hi . hi .
and also , mm , to tell you in a very gut @-@ ful fashion ,
face @-@ to @-@ face ,
about something that i have been thinking about .
but i do think that , um , i am going to have to leave
about five minutes early today .
uh , cam is -- is coaching a high @-@ school football game .
i &apos;m in .
what ?
certainly not gonna be able to focus on any of this today .
yeah , i need a shot of marching bands ,
fresh @-@ cut grass , rosy @-@ cheeked kids .
do they still run through a banner ?
they do !
i love that . i love that .
ok . so the game &apos;s at what , like , 4 : 00 ?
we should probably -- hey ! give me that .
i &apos;m --
this is my private cell .
only three people in the whole world use this .
two people .
uh , claire , is , uh -- is there a reason
you didn &apos;t sign this shipping form ?
oh , no . sorry . i &apos;ll do it now .
oh , no . no . now &apos;s a little late .
see , they came in this morning ,
and they can &apos;t do a thing without a manager &apos;s signature .
so now i &apos;ve got 100 rosewood panels lined up in the warehouse .
on the future , i &apos;d appreciate it --
hey , hey , tim . i think you made your point .
it was an honest mistake , all right ?
dad .
i &apos;m just saying that it &apos;s what a warehouse is for ,
to hold things .
not the end of the world .
right . of course .
sorry .
no , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s my fault . bye , tim . bye !
dad !
this is exactly what i was talking about in the car this morning !
i want them to see me like a co @-@ worker ,
not somebody who &apos;s getting special treatment
&apos;cause she &apos;s the boss &apos; daughter .
is it possible you &apos;re being a little oversensitive here ?
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m being -- wow , here ? really ? !
you know , you gave me this .
look how adorable you were .
okay . okay . okay .
i want you to try really hard to hear what i &apos;m saying .
when i need your help , i will ask for it .
and until then , just butt out .
what happened to you ?
hey , miller , your toes are looking a little lonely .
why don &apos;t you pay them a visit ?
what &apos;s with the extra warm @-@ ups , coach ?
these guys haven &apos;t won all year .
did you hear that , team ?
miller just bought you a little present .
i wasn &apos;t complaining . i was just wondering why we have to --
take a lap !
burt levoisier , red stagg ,
duckie pond --
all coaching legends at this high school ,
and none have won more than two games their first season .
i win today , that makes three ,
making me the winningest first @-@ year freshman coach ever .
oh , hey , luke , reuben &apos;s sick ,
so i &apos;m gonna need you to be the announcer today .
how am i supposed to keep score and announce at the same time ?
same way you &apos;re a spaz and a dork at the same time , spork .
okay , lose the attitude , but keep that intensity .
uh , hey , excuse me , ref .
what &apos;s with all the black arm bands ?
their coach passed away last night .
he &apos;d been sick for a while .
that &apos;s terrible . and we &apos;re still playing ?
well , they &apos;re tough kids .
roger knight lived for high @-@ school football ,
so they &apos;re playing this one in his honor .
okay , hey , guys ! guys ! guys ! guys !
tragic news about coach knight .
but you know what ? we need to focus up .
plenty of time to pay our respects ,
but there will be no mourning knight this afternoon .
lot of character over there .
yep .
those kids haven &apos;t won a game all year .
uh @-@ huh .
and now to have to play on his birthday ...
okay , see you at the coin toss .
top of the morning !
real estate and ,
to a lesser extent , life
is all about perseverance .
things go wrong .
keys get lost , deals fall through , keys get misplaced .
uh , a lot of it has to do with keys .
but that &apos;s when you find out there are two types of people --
those who waste time staring at a closed door ...
and those who find a window .
i &apos;m looking at my first month ever without a sale .
some people might give up .
but those people aren &apos;t phil dunphy .
no !
it &apos;s like i tell my kids --
keep a positive attitude and things will fall your way .
as my favorite redhead once sang ,
the sun will come out tomorrow .
that redhead , of course , was mitchell ,
introducing me to the plucky orphan annie ...
... whose never @-@ say @-@ die attitude pulled this country
out of a little thing called ...
the great depression .
and anything a little girl can do , i can try to do , too .
hey , guys ! welcome back !
drink it in !
pretty great , huh ?
oh , am i glad you guys could see this during the daytime .
i really think it shows better like that .
so ?
should we just cut to the chase and pay me my commission ?
i &apos;m kidding . you don &apos;t pay me directly .
there &apos;s no fee in dun-- phil .
listen , phil , we &apos;ve got some great news .
i love it ! where &apos;s my lucky pen ?
we wanted to tell you this in person .
we just came from the doctor .
i &apos;m pregnant !
oh , my god ! you guys !
except we decided to put off buying the house
until after the baby &apos;s born .
sure .
we &apos;ve been trying for , like , six years .
sure .
for a while there ,
it seemed like the universe was against us .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
why would the universe be against one person ?
here , have a spirit sticker !
don &apos;t be the only student without one .
i actually go to this school !
wow , you really are invisible , huh ?
i could not be more fine with it .
you &apos;re like that guy from that movie
who wishes he was never born .
&quot; it &apos;s a wonderful life . &quot;
you say that , but do you mean it ?
beautiful day here at red stagg field .
kicking off for the home team is number 44,
jason miller ,
who also plays lacrosse , soccer , and all the girl parts
when he and his friends act out
&quot; high school musical . &quot;
quite possibly the only girl parts he &apos;ll ever see .
haley !
hey , dylan !
i didn &apos;t realize you were coming here .
are you kidding ?
this place was like a home to me .
it &apos;s like i was homeschooled .
but i wasn &apos;t . i was school @-@ schooled .
were you ?
i got six kinds of pills in my pocket ,
but this here , all this , this is the best medicine .
aw , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re feeling better .
so , charlie , i --
i &apos;m here to get lily .
oh , before i call her , we had a small issue today .
one of the boys , patrick , said lily pushed him down
and tried to kiss him .
no , that doesn &apos;t sound like lily .
she was probably imitating something she saw
on tv or in her family --
ay , it was the tv , yes .
oh , but here she is . she &apos;s always so sweet .
bye , patrick .
you see ? they &apos;re just friends .
what are you laughing at , evan ?
you &apos;re next .
okay , i &apos;m going to talk to her for a little bit .
oh , did i ever tell you that i put your name up here ?
huh ?
&quot; haley dunphy dome . &quot;
aww , you named our special spot ?
actually it was supposed to be &quot; haley dunphy , do me . &quot;
i &apos;m bad with spacing .
oh , you &apos;re not so bad .
and that &apos;s halftime -- panthers 6 , dolphins 0 .
that zero score by jason miller ,
who proudly prances off the field .
just let me go up there and kick that kid &apos;s butt .
knock it off , miller . i need your leg .
take a knee .
now , i don &apos;t know what tuna net you dolphins swam into ,
but you are drowning out there !
coach , would it really be such a bad thing if we lost ?
beg your pardon ?
look at them , coach .
haven &apos;t they lost enough already ?
maybe giving them a win would ,
in a way , be a victory for us , too .
okay , you know what mattered the most to coach knight ?
his work with special @-@ needs kids ?
okay , he took one kid to one beach one time .
football !
football is what mattered the most !
he lived for competition !
he believed in sportsmanship , integrity !
okay ? now , the way i see it , we can roll over
and give them an empty , meaningless victory
that he ... would hate .
or we can go out there , leave it all on the field ,
and be a team he would be proud to lose to .
now , is this an &quot; i &quot; activity or a &quot; we &quot; activity ? !
we !
what ? !
we !
what ? !
we ! we ! we ! we ! we ! we !
that &apos;s right !
now you sound like dolphins !
hey , tim !
i got the next three days of delivery slips
for you here , signed , huh ?
thanks , claire .
yeah .
signed those up good , huh ?
thanks .
so , this is -- this is the , uh , the regency birch ?
beautiful model . gorgeous .
you guys do such good work down here .
really , you mind if i take her for a spin
before she goes up to the showroom ?
you &apos;re the boss ...
&apos;s daughter .
that &apos;s what you want to say .
oh , okay . so , no mirror when they &apos;re shipping , which makes sense .
also have , uh ... no handles .
hey -- hey , tim ?
hey , tim !
tim !
oh , god . yeah , hi , dad .
hey , co @-@ worker .
just seeing when you want to leave for the game .
we &apos;re late already .
soon , soon .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m finishing up
a little paperwork in my office .
okay . let me know if you need any help .
no , i do not need your help .
and as i believe i mentioned , i would appreciate it
if you were not constantly looking over my shoulder .
come on . give me some credit .
that &apos;s the last thing i would do .
dad , you seem to forget that i raised three children ,
and i had a career before this .
i have done plenty of stuff that does not --
do you hear that ?
sounds like it &apos;s coming from the warehouse .
yeah , what even is that ?
oh , i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
uh , one piece of advice -- take it or leave it .
what ?
the latch is under the panel on the right .
i got you mustard and sauerkraut , just what you like .
you &apos;re being awfully nice ,
considering i started that whole closet @-@ nado .
well , you &apos;re still my daughter .
it &apos;s okay i call you that here , right ?
yeah .
listen , it &apos;s hard for me to treat you like everyone else .
you &apos;re the only one i carried home in my arms --
except dontrell , last year &apos;s christmas party .
i pretty much poured him through his sunroof .
but i &apos;ll try .
thanks , dad .
you got plans this weekend ?
no . not really . why ?
good .
be at the warehouse , 8 : 00 tomorrow .
wear something you don &apos;t care about .
hey , guys .
hi , honey .
what &apos;d i miss ?
nothing good .
we &apos;re down by 6 with 3 minutes to play .
well , they could still turn it around .
&#91; 比赛尚未完全结束之前不能确定胜负 &#93;
show &apos;s not over till the fat -- mama !
sensational punt by miller , who hasn &apos;t kicked that high
since he broke the gender barrier
and joined our own modern dance troupe .
are you okay , honey ?
yeah !
it &apos;s all about keeping an attitive positude .
positude attitive .
hey , we should see a midnight movie tonight ,
like old times .
oh , my god . i am so in !
cool . cool .
i &apos;ll come by your house around 11 : 30 with the ladder ?
i don &apos;t need to climb out of my window anymore , dylan .
oh , ooh . can we do it earlier ? i have a midterm tomorrow .
oh , i can &apos;t do earlier .
i &apos;ve got to meet up with some classmates from nursing school .
you &apos;re gonna be a nurse ?
yeah , i figured it was a natural next step .
i &apos;ve always healed people with my music ,
and now i &apos;m just doing the same thing with drugs .
wow . well , ye-- another time , then .
yeah .
yeah .
hey , if everything goes well ,
maybe one day i &apos;ll see you in the hospital .
i &apos;d like that .
so , i finally get out of the closet ,
and there &apos;s dad looking down at me .
been there .
the whole daddy thing , though ,
it &apos;s really one of your bigger issues .
at least my daddy issues are with my actual daddy .
i don &apos;t run around making every authority figure
i meet into a father .
wait .
w @-@ what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
mitchell , come on .
why have you not quit your job yet ?
his girlfriend just broke up with him .
yeah , and what was your excuse last week ?
i had a cold .
and the week before ?
i felt a cold coming on .
mitchell , this fell out of your jacket .
care to explain ?
i was holding it for a friend .
you want to quit ?
charlie , you &apos;re -- you &apos;re a great boss ,
but i ju-- i got this other offer ,
and i just really miss the courtroom .
well , i &apos;m not gonna lie to you ,
you &apos;re ... really letting me down .
i just expected so much more out of you .
ohh . you were my favorite .
ohh , god .
um , well , maybe i @-@ i could still do things on the weekends .
no , no ! charlie , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
i -- i &apos;m done .
you know what ?
i don &apos;t blame you .
i have to get back on solid ground .
we both do .
well , i do more .
my house is a boat .
you made me in trouble .
i didn &apos;t tell you to sit on a boy until he liked you .
yes @-@ huh .
nuh @-@ huh .
we &apos;re not doing this again .
home team calls time @-@ out .
12 seconds left , they &apos;re down by 6,
and unable to shake the miller curse .
that &apos;s it !
okay , boys , final play .
time for a little trickery .
oh , honey . what happened to you today ?
a cosmic pummeling .
i lost the deal .
if i don &apos;t close on one tomorrow ,
it &apos;s gonna be my first month ever with no sale .
actually , there is no 31st this month .
what are you talking about ?
tomorrow &apos;s the first .
honey , i &apos;m sorry . are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay !
i just found out there is literally no tomorrow !
you know , i always say if you wait long enough ,
your luck will change ?
turns out that &apos;s just a big pile of c--
hold on to your hats , folks .
are they ? they are ! it &apos;s the triple gull @-@ wing !
that &apos;s my play !
woodson fakes right , he fakes right again ,
he fakes faking right , and he scores !
they scored on my play !
mitchell says you can sell me a house .
yes , i can !
good call , phil . was that your play ? !
yes , it was !
you &apos;re being too rough , lily .
you cannot just see a guy and ,
mwah , kiss him like that , okay ?
yes , you can ! yes , you can !
okay ! okay ! miller &apos;s out . manny , you &apos;re my backup kicker .
i need you to go out there and nail this .
although if i miss it ,
wouldn &apos;t a tie be a perfect way to --
manny , enough !
you are not gonna take away my victory !
i mean -- i mean , your victory .
okay ?
manny , i &apos;m sorry . i should not have yelled at you .
you can go out there and do whatever feels right .
okay ? i support you no matter what .
hut ! hut ! hike !
i won ! i won ! i mean , we won !
we won ! we won !
ooph ! sorry , ma &apos;am .
ma &apos;am ? i sit next to you in english .
hey , i think i dropped my phone under the bleachers .
come get it with me ?
found it .
great , and world order is restored .
can we go home now ?
yeah . okay .
oh , hey , what &apos;s that ?
&quot; alex dunphy dome ? &quot;
uh , i think it says &quot; alex dunphy , do me . &quot;
ugh , who would write something like that ?
no idea .
hey , you want me to scratch it out ?
no ! i mean , pfft , too late now .
if it &apos;s out there , it &apos;s out there .
hey , champ .
aren &apos;t you gonna go celebrate with your team ?
yeah , in a minute .
you meant to miss the kick , didn &apos;t you ?
i blew it .
i could miss that kick nine out of ten times .
why couldn &apos;t i miss it when it counted ?
let me ask you something .
that ball sails through the uprights ,
your team carries you off the field .
how does that feel ?
come on .
good .
it &apos;s fun being part of a team .
and it &apos;s really fun being the hero .
so i think you made that kick on purpose .
and listen .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re willing to admit it yet ,
but somewhere underneath all that humanity ,
there &apos;s a competitor -- sorry .
there &apos;s a competitor , and , manny ,
there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
nothing .
thanks , coach .
you want to go eat some pizza ?
sure .
me , too .
hey , you think someday they might name this field after you ?
well , you &apos;re not the first person
to think along those lines .
earlier today , someone in the faculty bathroom
was messing around with the phrase &quot; cameron tucker dome . &quot;
just sold the most expensive house in town ,
sight unseen , all cash .
how &apos; bout that ?
i &apos;m proud of you , dad .
pretty great day for all the dunphys .
and then i said , &quot; michelle , do you honestly believe
every stupid rumor you hear ? &quot;
oh , you haven &apos;t heard ?
well , apparently , one of my exes is just , like ...
tim , i -- i am so sorry that you got hurt ,
and i will get to the bottom of it ,
but i suspect it was sabotage by the competition ,
maybe closets , closets , closets , closets .
not too bad , a little puffy , kind of like your eyes were
when you saw &quot; finding nemo , &quot; miller .
