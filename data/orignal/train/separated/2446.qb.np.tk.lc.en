i &apos;m zach and gail &apos;s daughter sarah salvatore .
why don &apos;t you believe me ?
because sarah salvatore is in duke university
where she studies as an art major .
now who the hell are you ?
my name is monique .
i want the whole story .
don &apos;t do this .
no .
i &apos;ll find out sooner or later .
so my mom has a brain tumor .
then we &apos;ll just give her vampire blood .
if our blood cured cancer
we would have heard about that by now ?
in our coven &apos;s tradition ,
the twins merge their strength .
the stronger one wins .
the weaker one dies .
why should we have to die
because our sister &apos;s too weak to defeat our psychopath of a brother ?
merging is our duty to the coven .
it &apos;s why we were born .
this is the antimagic border ,
sucked up all that magic from the traveler spell .
a lot of magic .
i don &apos;t know what we were or are
or what we &apos;re supposed to be ,
but i want to see you .
come over .
anybody there ?
i may have put a cloaking spell on us .
see , we never went out to dinner when i was a kid ,
so , i always had this fascination with chefs and fine dining .
dad actually lets me cook ...
taught me to measure by eye .
seasonings to taste , all that stuff ,
but it &apos;s different now in the restaurant world .
everything &apos;s on timers . it &apos;s like ...
fries go in , you push a button .
it dings , you take them out . literally , no guesswork .
why am i here ?
oh , well , i spent 18 years in abandoned restaurants
and now i &apos;m showing off the fruits of my labor .
i don &apos;t mean the mystic grill .
oh , you mean like here , here , in mystic falls ?
sorry . i &apos;m nervous i &apos;m--
you &apos;re , like , really pretty .
why am i here , kai ?
well , i took a spell that was
keeping supernaturals out of mystic falls
and i ... i , like , absorbed it , like ,
like , ate it , i guess .
it &apos;s cool , huh ?
first i eat magic and then eventually ,
i lose it , but , i mean , a huge spell like that ?
i mean , come on .
magic &apos;s oozing out of me . it &apos;s all over the place .
you know , i didn &apos;t quite realize ,
i was so out of control
until i met the manager of the grill a few hours ago
and he was all like , &quot; yeah , you can &apos;t come in here , we &apos;re closed ,
and you have an unconscious girl over your shoulder . &quot;
and i was like , &quot; don &apos;t judge me . &quot;
so , then i gave him a heart attack . tried to .
but all i did was make him vomit uncontrollably ,
which was like , uhh , all right , let &apos;s stop that .
so , i tried again , and i think i broke his spine .
i &apos;m not--i &apos;m not really sure ,
because the third time i tried the spell ,
he kind of exploded in blood .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i just told you . i have too much magic .
you know , it wasn &apos;t until after my test run with the manager
that i realized , if i start to merge with jo
and my gushing fountains of magic turn her into that guy ,
then i &apos;m not gonna have a twin for the merge .
so , elena , that is why you are here .
because ... i need to get my magic under control .
by practicing with you . or , rather ,
by practicing on you .
oh , hey , p.s. , silver lining ?
after the manager finally stopped thrashing around ,
i finally managed a cloaking spell .
thank you .
it &apos;s easy to do and undo .
phasmatos oculix .
table for 3 .
you had no idea .
because that &apos;s the first thing i want to see in the morning .
sorry . i forgot you lived here .
yeah .
any chance you could help me out with some speakers at caroline &apos;s--
house ?
thanks for the coffee .
sorry , are you ok ?
yeah , yeah , fine .
just clothes and skin .
hey , where can i get a t @-@ shirt ?
damon &apos;s room . upstairs , end of the hall .
what are you doing in my house ?
fire spell . sort of .
it turns out getting back in touch with magic
isn &apos;t anything like riding a bike .
i am sorry about that vase , though .
was that expensive ?
well , i don &apos;t know , but the smithsonian would .
you should call them .
oh , thank god . breakfast .
please tell me that you brought mimosas .
do you actually think i &apos;d watch this sober ?
and what exactly are we watching ?
today we make s &apos;mores .
in a month , i win the merge
and i become leader of my coven ,
guaranteeing its survival .
liv has me on a 30 @-@ day regimen
between now and the next celestial event .
and this regimen has to happen in my living room why ?
damon feels guilty .
that &apos;s new . and where the hell is he ?
i paid extra for this room to be a single .
you clearly underestimate the number of women
who &apos;d die to spend the night with me .
well , i &apos;m not dead yet .
any word from elena ?
oh , i got words . plural .
i got
&quot; something came up at the dorm .
had to bail . can we rain check ? &quot;
an emoticon of a cold shower .
have you at least managed to patch things up with ric ?
well , baby steps . step one ,
allow him to turn my house into hogwarts .
step two , call in a favor from the sheriff .
ask her to put out an apb
on a supercharged serial killer named kai parker .
yeah , i already have my guys on the lookout .
no one matching kai &apos;s description popped up overnight .
what the hell is he doing ?
bad news is , the employee kitchen didn &apos;t have a juicer .
good news is , they do now .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a kale smoothie .
it &apos;s good for dna cell repair and for slowing cancer .
oh , are you warm enough ?
i &apos;m fine .
let me just
get you another blanket .
so you can literally smother her ?
i &apos;m just trying to help here .
since apparently , modern medicine takes forever .
i don &apos;t understand why we can &apos;t skip all the guesswork
and go straight to something that works .
like vampire blood .
we are not having this conversation again , sweetheart .
ok , then , what do you want to talk about ?
how the doctors can &apos;t operate ,
how chemo won &apos;t work ,
how radiation won &apos;t shrink the tumor ?
damon , feel free to jump in with your support here at any time .
well , i think that would require you having my support , caroline .
you don &apos;t think that our blood will work ?
for 170 @-@ odd years , i &apos;ve never known an instance
where our blood cured cancer .
but hey , sheriff , if you want to be a guinea pig
in an experimental study involving weird , unpredictable magic ...
far be it from me to stop you .
look ... sweetheart .
for now , i would like to put my faith in science ,
which means going home on doctor &apos;s orders ,
having a nice , quiet day ,
and waiting for more mri results .
see ?
mommy knows best .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i have to make sure the witches aren &apos;t destroying my house .
feel better .
damon may be a vile creature , but he has the best clothes .
should i be wondering why you &apos;re in damon salvatore &apos;s bedroom ?
jo scorched my shirt .
so , you &apos;re shirtless in damon &apos;s bedroom .
you must be feeling such mixed emotions right now .
how &apos;s the training going ?
jo &apos;s terrible . if she went up against kai today ,
she &apos;d lose in , like , 9 seconds .
luke totally called that one .
yeah , but you &apos;ve got time to whip her into shape .
has luke been giving you crap ?
he &apos;s been texting . i &apos;ve been ignoring .
if he finds out you &apos;re training jo ...
he won &apos;t . chill , ok ?
you kept my orchid alive .
that &apos;s amazing .
i wanted everything to be just the same when you finally came home .
what is this ?
uh , stefan volunteered to move your entertainment center in here
so now you can watch tv from your favorite chair .
i hooked up the surround sound to your dvd player
and i left a universal remote on the table right there .
well , thanks .
guess it never occurred to anybody to just move my chair , but ...
what &apos;s the matter ?
never seen anyone with stage 4 cancer before ?
actually , no , i haven &apos;t .
one of the few perks of starting over every few decades--
real life never really catches up to you .
so , if you start the &quot; friends &quot; box set now ,
i &apos;ll be back in time for monica and chandler &apos;s wedding .
stefan , you know how to laugh , right ?
opinions vary .
wait , why ? are you leaving ?
every minute counts , so ,
i &apos;m gonna go get a second opinion
from one of the world &apos;s leading experts
in grade iv glioblastoma .
i couldn &apos;t sleep . i googled .
and where is the internet sending you ?
duke .
duke ?
you know what ? maybe i &apos;ll give you a ride .
i was thinking of , um , heading that way
to check on a friend .
a friend .
stefan , i know all of your friends .
elena . me . and then that &apos;s it .
i think it would be better if you had some company on the road .
thank you , stefan .
i will call you every hour on the hour .
i will set my watch by it .
i love you .
i love you , too .
bye .
we &apos;re in my high school ?
they have plenty of restrooms ,
no flammable surfaces ,
and everyone &apos;s on winter break .
still , it &apos;s no wonder america got dumb when i was locked up .
they &apos;re never in school .
is that you ?
oh , and there &apos;s bonnie .
you guys look so innocent .
smiling like nothing bad could ever happen to you .
anyway , do you mind if i try to turn your blood into acid again ?
again ?
yeah , that &apos;s ...
it &apos;s kind of how you got here in the first place .
i was trying the whole acid @-@ blood thing
and i think i burst a few important capillaries in your brain ,
because you blacked out .
kai , you don &apos;t have to do this .
listen to me ...
phasmatos navaro
you don &apos;t have to do this .
pulsus sanguinox .
please , kai , stop .
phasmatos navaro ...
stop . stop , kai . stop .
my ring .
sanguinox .
kai , you &apos;re melting my ring .
phasmatos ...
kai , stop it !
navaro ... pul--
no . no , no , no , no .
no , no , no . no .
no .
no .
i take it that ring meant something to you ?
i never understood sentimental attachments to things ,
because then it &apos;s so upsetting when you lose them .
that doesn &apos;t count . i was distracted .
you wearing my shirt ?
magic camp .
how may i help you ?
damon , kai has me at the high school . i need your help .
elena ?
really ?
damn it .
bingo .
so , your friend i &apos;ve never heard of
is a world @-@ famous photographer ?
well , it &apos;s a student exhibition .
oh . goody . freshman art .
since you &apos;re so great at noticing untapped potential ,
how do you know this person again ?
oh , yes , i did call earlier about a consult with dr. moore .
great . ok , they can see us right now .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna catch up .
ok . uh , oncology center , d4 . come find me .
ok .
excuse me . can you point me to sarah nelson &apos;s exhibit ?
far corner . good choice .
she &apos;s one of our best new students .
thank you .
according to the saying , when a child dies ,
an angel will take the child in her arms
and fly her over all the places she loved best ,
so she can see them one last time before she goes to heaven .
that &apos;s what i had in mind with this aerial point of view .
and then i wanted to catch the sunlight flaring off the windows
because it obscures the reflection of the viewer
who &apos;s looking down at them .
good stuff .
what are you doing here ?
same thing you are .
looking for a little art to decorate my wall .
and that &apos;s when i read your article
in the &quot; new england journal of medicine . &quot;
you know , the one about tumor reduction using hyperthermia treatments .
that &apos;s not exactly light reading .
well , i didn &apos;t say understood it . ha !
these are my mom &apos;s charts .
but your bio said that
you &apos;re an amazing expert on glioblastoma ,
and i really , really need an expert ,
because my mom &apos;s doctors are telling her
that she &apos;s not a candidate for clinical trials .
and you &apos;re not gonna give me any grief
on insurance or confidentiality
or anything except your honest opinion .
her doctors are doing everything right .
it &apos;s a grade iv tumor .
they could try full @-@ brain radiation ,
but that would seriously impact
any remaining quality of life .
she &apos;ll face cognitive and verbal decline ,
motor loss , personality change ,
and meanwhile , she could still develop
morphine @-@ resistant pain .
so , you &apos;re saying that there &apos;s no feasible medical solution .
i really wish there were .
i have a patient in nearly identical condition .
he hasn &apos;t responded to any treatment .
now he &apos;s just running down the clock .
i want to see him .
oh . hello .
nice shirt .
well , thanks .
yeah , somebody burned my other one .
which was awesome , by the way .
i &apos;m starting to see why damon digs you .
you are crazypants .
oh , it sucks about that shirt , though .
so , you can care about an inanimate object
but not the people that you kill ?
is this gonna be like an episode of &quot; ricki lake &quot;
where i come face to face with my demons
and change for the better ?
have you really not cared about anyone ?
i guess i liked my brother joey .
we played dr. mario together and he &apos;d always win .
actually , one of my favorite memories
is when i finally beat him .
of course , my favorite memory is
when i finally beat him to death .
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy trying to change me .
if ricki taught me anything , it &apos;s that
liking yourself is the most important thing .
and i like me .
to think--a day almost went by
where i wasn &apos;t roped into saving one of your friends .
cry me a river .
just do the stupid cloaking spell
so i can go grab elena
and you can go back to wrecking my mansion .
fine .
what are you doing ? back door is right here .
i &apos;m not going in there .
what ?
if kai even gets a glimpse of me , i &apos;m dead .
i &apos;m strong enough to do the spell from out here .
whatever . i hope you cloak better than you teach .
because the looks of my living room ,
jo &apos;s not learning very much .
relax . with a bit of practice ,
she &apos;ll be merge @-@ ready in no time .
phasmatos radium cara . phasmatos--
liv .
liv ?
hey . liv !
sorry .
what the hell are you doing here ?
she doesn &apos;t have time for this .
invisique .
no !
so , liv &apos;s gone . i need a plan b .
wait , what do you mean she &apos;s gone ?
her wonder twin took her and i can &apos;t just go blazing in there .
kai will kill elena to spite me .
i need a witch .
i can do it .
you can barely light a candle .
cloaking is one of the first things they teach you as a gemini .
i learned it when i was a kid .
but ?
i &apos;ll have to stay beside damon while i do it ,
which means i &apos;ll have to go inside .
ok , look , there &apos;s gotta be some other option .
there is .
right here .
let me guess-- jeremy &apos;s holding a crossbow .
no one is killing kai .
we &apos;re not letting kai kill elena .
nobody &apos;s letting anyone die .
anyone have any other ideas ?
dad &apos;s pissed , ok ?
he wants us back in portland now .
i was helping them .
they can help themselves .
we &apos;re not their dancing witch @-@ monkeys .
you want to bring these books back ?
take the books . leave the books . who cares ?
did you tell dad i was helping jo get stronger ?
is that why he &apos;s pissed ?
of course you did . you &apos;re just like him .
actually , i can think for myself .
i &apos;ve always said that kai was too dangerous
to become leader of the coven .
you &apos;ve been wasting your time with jo .
we both know she &apos;s never gonna beat him .
you don &apos;t get it , do you ?
get what ?
you just cloaked me
and i couldn &apos;t fight it .
you &apos;re stronger than me .
no , you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do . i &apos;ve known it for months .
since that night when i was trying
to bring people back from the other side
and you interrupted my spell .
you were about to collapse .
you were already weak .
we &apos;re supposed to be equal .
we &apos;re not .
i know you , luke .
i know you love me ,
and i know a huge part of you
hopes that it &apos;s me that makes it through this .
but it &apos;s not a coin toss anymore .
if we merge , you win and i die .
that scares the crap out of me .
so . if you want to pack the books ,
pack the damn books .
i &apos;m not gonna be the one reading them .
i came in to do inventory and found him like this .
sorry to bother you on your day off , sheriff , but--
no , i &apos;m glad you called .
i don &apos;t think he died of natural causes .
22 hours and 18 minutes .
that &apos;s how long supernatural beings
have been allowed back in mystic falls
and i already know someone who &apos;s dead because of it .
i &apos;m sorry , matt .
we &apos;ll figure out who did this
and we &apos;ll deal with it .
this is never gonna end , is it ?
the attacks , the cover @-@ ups .
this is our life again .
mystic falls .
it &apos;ll always be mystic falls .
if you love it here --
sheriff , you ok ?
yeah .
ok . all right .
colin phelps . inoperable tumor .
they zapped your brain with radiation for months .
they still couldn &apos;t save you .
yeah . i &apos;d be groggy , too ,
if i were on this many painkillers .
and the doctor said all they can do is just
make you comfortable while you wait for the end .
i &apos;m really sorry to hear that .
next of kin -- none .
i &apos;m really sorry to hear that , too .
but you see , on my mom &apos;s chart ,
this spot , next of kin ,
that &apos;s where my name goes .
caroline forbes .
i &apos;m all she &apos;s got .
i know we just met ,
but you &apos;re not going to remember any of this .
if the spell that you &apos;re going for is to creep me out ,
it &apos;s working .
what are you doing ?
mm , nothing .
just working on my self @-@ control .
i can hear kai yammering .
what &apos;s he saying ?
he said ...
it &apos;s a shame you don &apos;t have vamp @-@ hearing .
i get why you don &apos;t like me , you know ?
you and alaric were bros . a girl comes into the picture .
it &apos;s awkward .
it &apos;s not awkward . it &apos;s annoying .
because he &apos;s looking out for me ?
yes . at the expense of logic and reason .
oh , let me guess-- you &apos;ve never done that for a girl before .
ok .
what do you know ? it &apos;s working .
so . i &apos;m guessing you came here to make a demand ?
i only came to see what you were up to today .
i hate unanswered questions and you &apos;ve left me with a few .
such as what secret did you need to protect
by letting me kill that pitiful con artist
pretending to be your long @-@ lost relative sarah salvatore ?
so , i followed you ,
in your inconspicuous red porsche
off the exit to chapel hill , and here we are .
sarah ... nelson &apos;s photography exhibition .
why do you care ?
well , it seems that damon is unaware
that the branches of his family tree
might extend beyond just you .
call me old @-@ fashioned ,
but i disapprove of secrets between brothers .
so , i &apos;ll just go tell sarah what your name is and--
don &apos;t do that .
why don &apos;t you want to meet sarah nelson ?
you came all this way to see her work .
what do you want me to tell you , enzo ?
that the girl &apos;s my relative ?
fine . she is zach salvatore &apos;s daughter ,
which makes her my great @-@ niece 4 generations removed .
i took her mother &apos;s body to the er
after damon killed her .
they did a c @-@ section to save sarah &apos;s life ,
but i kept that little detail from damon
so that she could live a good life
in a nice home where she felt safe and loved .
that &apos;s my big secret .
why are you so intent on keeping it ?
you want to tell damon that i &apos;ve been lying to him
for the past 18 years , go ahead , be my guest .
maybe he &apos;ll hate me . or maybe he &apos;ll realize
it was the best thing i could &apos;ve done for everyone .
but either way , once you tell him ,
you &apos;ll have nothing left to obsess about .
i thought you were meeting me here .
yeah , i got into a bidding war over a piece of art .
that &apos;s fascinating . can you just get here ?
i &apos;m conducting an experiment .
what kind of experiment ?
i &apos;ll show you when you get here . just hurry .
know what , mate ?
you can keep that piece of art .
photography bores me . i withdraw my bid .
how are you here right now ?
jo &apos;s invisibility spell .
if you can see us , that means you joined the party .
come on . we need to get out of here .
my ring . it &apos;s gone .
kai melted it into nothing .
what ?
not to cut this reunion short ,
but meter &apos;s running on this spell .
well , there &apos;s the tunnels under the school .
good call . boiler room . stat . come on .
you good ?
i &apos;m good .
what the hell are you talking about ?
you said you and luke were equal in strength .
well , i lied . he &apos;s stronger .
then we run .
run where , tyler ?
we already tried that .
my family will hunt me down .
they want me to merge .
fine . then go .
screw you .
i &apos;m serious . go .
that &apos;s what you want me to say , right ?
so , go . walk right into your own grave
if that &apos;s what you want .
i won &apos;t stop you .
i knew you were a mistake .
this whole thing was a mistake .
this wasn &apos;t a mistake .
this wasn &apos;t a mistake .
i called dad .
i told him we &apos;re out .
i thought you were about following your destiny .
not if my destiny equals killing my sister .
i told you i could think for myself .
you ok ?
yeah .
3 people is just a lot more to cloak than two .
why is your nose bleeding ?
i have a guess .
magic &apos;s hard . isn &apos;t it , jo ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t sweat it .
i want him to see me while i kick his ass .
get out of here . ok ?
where &apos;s elena ?
oh . are we not cloaking people anymore ?
i thought that &apos;s what this was .
oh , that &apos;s gotta hurt .
i am definitely getting the hang of this .
cloaking spells , illusions . it &apos;s all the same wheelhouse .
no .
now that i got the kinks worked out ,
we can actually do this .
is there an upcoming celestial event that interests you ?
i &apos;m partial--uhh !
i &apos;m ok .
come on , baby . come on . ha !
you have no idea how long it &apos;s been since i had an appetite .
an hour ago , he was dying of brain cancer .
now look at him .
smile , stefan . this is good news .
my blood worked . he &apos;s totally fine .
it seems too easy .
as opposed to what ?
vampire blood heals a stab wound
like it was never there .
it &apos;s always easy , stefan .
it is literally magic .
then why haven &apos;t i ever heard
of our blood curing cancer before ?
because vampires don &apos;t spend their lives
pulling charity shifts at the sick ward .
look , i want this to work , ok ?
stefan , i just--
i need you to believe it will work .
or at the very least , just believe that
i believe it will work .
i can see that you believe it .
then take me home to my mom .
ok . let &apos;s go home .
ok .
ok .
relax .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ? didn &apos;t i get it ?
what ?
there must be another splinter
still stuck in my heart .
what ? no . no , no , no , no .
hey , look at me . i &apos;ll get it .
if there &apos;s any-- anything you need to say , anything ...
what ? i will find it elena .
now &apos;s the time .
come on .
seriously ?
yeah .
oldest trick in the book .
perfect timing .
elena , are you ok ?
i &apos;ve never felt more alive .
what is it about sarah &apos;s work that i find so uniquely appealing ?
perhaps that it &apos;s a little dark ,
has a morbid undertone .
must be a bloodlines thing .
her family &apos;s a bit extreme .
her uncle , great @-@ uncle , actually , fourth removed ,
is a bloody sociopath .
fourth removed ?
he &apos;s very old .
tried to kill me a few times .
succeeded once .
most recently , he set me up to die ,
which resulted in days of torture .
there i was ,
getting prodded with fire @-@ hot iron poker
by a man named tripp ,
all the while keeping my mouth shut
and enjoying the pain .
if you knew anything about my past ,
you &apos;d know that this brought back some very ...
unpleasant memories .
that &apos;s when i started plotting my revenge .
so , i see the free wine was a big hit .
the best revenge is patient . cultivated .
only no one sees it coming until it &apos;s too late .
but never mind all that .
now be a doll and help me box up these photographs , will you ?
sure you &apos;re ok having a pentobarbital @-@ ed houseguest ?
i am .
if it buys us enough time to get you back into fighting shape .
so , um , assuming that i don &apos;t get kidnapped before tomorrow ,
maybe we can , um ...
try for that dinner again ?
ooh , you know , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , every time we try and go on a date ,
you get kidnapped , i get sent to a prison world ,
or your feelings get compelled away .
i just--i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s gonna--
are you gonna keep sulking ,
or are you gonna let me take you to dinner ?
i guess we &apos;ll find out tomorrow .
i can help you clean that if you want .
one part ammonia , two parts meat tenderizer .
you invented a stain remover ?
i &apos;m not afraid of a little blood .
what &apos;d i tell you ? she &apos;s a keeper .
you know , i think she &apos;s gonna get a handle on this .
jo &apos;s not strong enough , ric .
she wouldn &apos;t lie about it .
no , no , no , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s lying about it .
he absorbed a spell the size of mystic falls , ric .
he changed the game .
look , we got kai on ice .
we &apos;ll just wait for his stolen magic to drain away
and then she &apos;ll beat him .
well , she can &apos;t .
well , she has to .
she will .
well , all right , then .
here &apos;s to women who make
crazy , screwed @-@ up decisions and ...
loving them more for it .
so , if sarah is zach &apos;s daughter ,
then does that make you uncle stefan ?
i tell you this secret i &apos;ve been keeping for 18 years ,
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about .
no , i think it &apos;s incredibly noble
that you &apos;ve been keeping an eye on her all these years .
and she &apos;s lucky to have you in her life ,
even if she has no idea .
hey , so , i know it goes without saying ,
but i would appreciate it if--
your secret &apos;s safe with me , stefan .
thank you .
no , thank you .
thank you for coming with me today
and for rewiring my mom &apos;s speaker system and for just
not treating me like a crazy person ,
because that &apos;s how i &apos;ve felt these past few days .
so , thank you .
wish me luck .
hey . there you are .
we &apos;re just about to watch another movie .
how was duke , sweetie ?
it was good . it was really good .
thanks for staying with her , matt .
anytime .
see you soon , sheriff .
see you , matt . bye . bye .
bye .
so , i met with that expert at duke today .
and she said that your doctors are doing everything right .
and she also said that there &apos;s nothing that they can do to cure you .
that is one doctor &apos;s opinion .
waiting for more medical opinions isn &apos;t going to change this .
you &apos;re dying , mom .
and we &apos;re out of options .
which is why i gave my blood to a cancer patient today .
and i healed him .
he was dying ,
and my blood healed him .
look , i &apos;m immortal and you &apos;re not ,
and i always knew that i would lose you one day ,
but i am not ready to lose you now .
you &apos;re supposed to be here for my college graduation .
we &apos;re supposed to argue about flower arrangements for my wedding .
we &apos;re supposed to have years and years
worth of birthday dinners and christmases
and whitewater rafting trips .
i want all of it .
i want you to live for me ,
and i know that that &apos;s selfish ,
but that &apos;s ... the truth .
i want that , too , honey .
ok .
somebody , please .
help me !
everything is gonna be ok .
