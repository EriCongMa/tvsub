hey ! what the hell &apos;s going on ? he &apos;s with me . he &apos;s my foster son .
we &apos;ve got to start communicating .
we &apos;re communicating right now !
we &apos;re never gonna get anywhere
if we keep pointing the finger at each other .
we need to go to therapy .
i cheated on my boyfriend ...
and i lost my virginity to a random boy i barely know .
i &apos;m pretty sure that makes me a slut .
you know what ? we all do things that we wish we hadn &apos;t .
what do i say to callie ? she &apos;s gonna hate me .
the next time you &apos;re looking for adventure ,
you ought to knock on my door .
a.j. , you &apos;re my foster brother . i can &apos;t .
hello ?
a.j. , it &apos;s ty .
you were three minutes long this morning .
can you stop timing my showers ?
sure . can you actually stick to schedule ?
yeah , brandon , you &apos;re first ,
so if you &apos;re late the whole system gets messed up .
a couple minutes doesn &apos;t matter .
until callie gets in there ,
and then three minutes turns to five ...
okay , wait . you &apos;re timing me now ? i &apos;m on your side here .
and then after a.j. , we &apos;re at six ...
whoa , whoa . leave me out of this .
so when &apos;s construction gonna be done ?
well , unfortunately ,
we had to fire the contractor . it &apos;s a long story ...
what are you doing with ketchup on tacos ?
that &apos;s disgusting !
that &apos;s gross .
so , callie , we &apos;re going to the store tomorrow .
is there anything in particular you want for your birthday party ?
i &apos;d hardly call it a party
when it &apos;s just us and the quinns .
well , lucky it &apos;s not your party then , isn &apos;t it ?
um , no . whatever is easy is fine ...
but i would like to , maybe talk about my ...
birthday gift to myself .
yeah ?
&quot; your birthday gift to yourself &quot; ?
well , interesting . what ... what exactly did you have in mind ?
so i have been saving from my job ,
and i have $ 800 .
well done .
wow . good job .
and i would like to buy myself a car .
oh , honey , i ... i don &apos;t know .
okay , i know it &apos;s a big deal ,
but it would just make it so much easier to get to work ,
and school and i could help you guys , too ,
you know with errands and stuff ...
careful what you wish for . they will run you ragged .
ey ! hey ! take it easy over there .
um , not that i mind . i don &apos;t mind .
i think that that &apos;s very admirable , callie ,
but i don &apos;t know if that
$ 800 is enough to buy something that &apos;s safe .
i thought you would say that ,
um ... but airbags have actually been standard since the &apos; 90s .
boy , you have done your research .
yes , so there are options .
uh , well , you know , what about monthly costs ?
there &apos;s gas and insurance ...
well , you pay for brandon &apos;s monthly costs ...
and you bought him a car .
sounds like sexism to me .
okay , moms didn &apos;t buy that car . it was a hand @-@ me @-@ down .
that got totaled , and then they bought you a nicer one .
it wasn &apos;t my fault .
i &apos;d like to make it clear that
insurance paid for that car .
yes , and it belongs to all of you , by the way .
what ... it does ?
yes , now that callie has her license
and the twins will soon , too . yes , it does .
what if we had two cars to share ?
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
but for now , the answer is no .
so , have you talked to callie yet ...
about the wyatt of it all ?
are you even going to ?
um , i wanna ...
i just , i &apos;m gonna wait
until after her birthday party to tell her .
you know , if i ruin that on top of everything else ,
she &apos;ll never forgive me .
well , that &apos;s gonna suck .
do you think she even should ... tell her , i mean ?
i &apos;m sorry , do i know you ?
it &apos;s just ... mariana &apos;s really hurting .
i know she would take it back if she could ,
but she can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not like she &apos;s dating wyatt .
it &apos;s just gonna hurt callie .
maybe everything doesn &apos;t have to be talked about .
well , i &apos;m not gonna argue with you about that one .
does this mean we don &apos;t have to go to therapy tomorrow ?
no .
just checking ...
hey , bud .
hey !
so , everyone &apos;s going to be here at 5 : 00 ...
i told them to park down the street ,
so she won &apos;t see the cars ...
good idea .
and callie has no idea .
happy birthday !
what ?
what is this ?
wow , mariana ...
what is this ?
600 bucks .
i saved it from my quinceanera and my allowance .
but , i want you to have it ...
so you can get a car that moms will approve .
uh , why would you ...
no , mariana , i can &apos;t .
what about , when you turn 16 and you want to buy a car ?
i &apos;ll just borrow yours .
no . i can &apos;t keep this .
okay , but what if we bought a car together ?
you know , with both of our jobs , i &apos;m sure ...
gas and insurance will be easy .
really ?
okay . i &apos;m in .
we just have to get moms on board .
why ?
sometimes it &apos;s better to ask forgiveness than permission .
so ...
it &apos;s really clear that you two love each other .
oh , well , thank god .
but ...
what &apos;s also clear
is that your concern for each other
is making you polite .
that doesn &apos;t work .
polite ?
it doesn &apos;t feel very polite .
no , no . probably not .
because all of your real issues then end up getting subverted
and coming out in all these passive @-@ aggressive ways .
sound familiar ?
so ...
i want you both to make lists .
everything you love about each other ...
and everything that drives you nuts .
and next week , we &apos;ll read them .
out loud ?
mm @-@ hmm .
we &apos;re going to jump start your communication skills .
starting with everything that we hate about each other ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ... i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m sorry , but aren &apos;t you supposed to be helping us stay married ?
pretty sweet , right ?
nelson was my first car .
it breaks my heart to have to sell him .
but i can tell you two will take care of him as well as i did .
so he &apos;s yours , if you want .
$ 1,400 .
we &apos;ll take it ... him ...
for $ 1,150 .
but the ad said $ 1,400 .
i know .
the car &apos;s in perfect condition .
i really can &apos;t let him go for any less .
that &apos;s too bad . thank you .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;re playing hardball .
she needs to know that we &apos;re
willing to walk away to take her seriously .
no , mariana , she named her car ...
okay ? this is not someone you can negotiate with .
okay , trust me .
she &apos;s going to ask us to stop in like five seconds .
she &apos;s leaving .
okay , she &apos;s going to call .
two hours tops .
hey ! what &apos;s up ?
hey ! what happened ?
i was waiting for you like you said .
i got into some trouble .
what kind of trouble ?
look , just tell me where you are and i &apos;ll come get you .
tonight , i can &apos;t .
tomorrow ?
okay . i gotta go .
all right . peace .
you need some help ?
uh , yeah . could you grab that card table ?
where &apos;d you get the phone ?
your dad .
oh , yeah ? who were you talking to ?
your dad .
it &apos;s been a half hour , mariana ,
okay ? i &apos;m tired of playing hardball .
that &apos;s our car .
okay , we can &apos;t cave . not now .
but nelson ...
fine !
hi ! my sister and i just test drove your car earlier ...
oh ! is that right ?
what ?
okay , great . thanks .
nelson found a new home .
mariana !
there you are ! where &apos;ve you been ?
the quinns are going to be here any minute ! come on !
paper products and platters on the big table .
we &apos;re eating buffet style tonight ...
and you will come back for condiments .
surprise !
don &apos;t look at me .
oh , we didn &apos;t tell mariana .
you know , she would &apos;ve blown the whole thing .
look , this is the first
truly happy birthday you &apos;ve had in a long time ,
and i ... all of us wanted to help you celebrate it !
did i miss a surprise ?
so you had no idea ?
none !
hey , where &apos;s dad ? you two are the only people i actually invited .
i don &apos;t know . mom dropped me off .
hey , girl !
get over here !
you seriously weren &apos;t going to tell us it was your birthday ?
yeah , thank god jude had the sense to invite us .
of course that means we got
double the chores to do at the house tomorrow ...
but yay ! happy birthday !
hey ! happy birthday !
and i , sincerely mean it .
look at you ...
really nice turn out .
thanks .
a lot of people love you , callie .
well , that &apos;s awkward .
i guess , maybe we should &apos;ve checked jude &apos;s guest list .
i got half the mind to smack that kid .
mariana said she was the one who instigated it ,
so , no need for violence .
well , there &apos;s something you can add to your hate list .
honey , it &apos;s not a hate list ...
the delivery guys were supposed to be here 30 minutes ago .
ah , well , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re just running behind , honey .
we &apos;ll give them a call though .
yeah . we can do that .
do you think callie &apos;s having fun ?
i think that you are the bestest brother ever .
hey , did you talk to a.j. this morning ?
what do you mean ?
like on the phone ?
i kinda overheard him on a call . he was acting weird .
he said he was talking to you .
i &apos;m sure he was .
it &apos;s like , what time ?
what &apos;s eating you , b ?
well , i just ... i ...
i think he was talking to his brother .
why ? did he say something specific ?
uh , no . he &apos;s just being all secretive or whatever .
i &apos;m not concerned .
hey ! can you grab me a lighter ?
i &apos;m sorry if me being here is weird ,
since you &apos;re avoiding me and all .
i &apos;m not avoiding you .
it &apos;s just complicated .
&apos;cause of callie , i get that .
and she doesn &apos;t know about anything , so ...
don &apos;t worry .
also , i had a boyfriend .
like , when we ...
exactly .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t ...
it &apos;s not your fault .
it &apos;s okay .
so you had a boyfriend ?
or you have ?
yo , callie , check this out .
* she &apos;s a &quot; c &quot; to the &quot; a &quot; to the double l @-@ i @-@ e *
* and a better friend there could never be *
* though if she &apos;s feeling that hunger itch *
* girl will straight steal your sandwich *
* as her former roommate , i must confess *
* callie &apos;s a slob a total mess *
that &apos;s true .
* i lived with her and if you care *
* i never seen her brush her hair *
* but we &apos;re just teasing you know she &apos;s the best *
* &apos; cause we &apos;re her friends we &apos;re hashtag blessed *
yo ! drop it like it &apos;s hot , ladies .
surprised to see me ?
yeah .
um , listen , my mums don &apos;t know that i got fired .
i know . i kind of assumed as much when i got invited .
we miss you at the center .
yeah . i miss you guys , too .
hey , so what &apos;s he doing here ?
uh , he kinda lives here now .
really ?
wow ! well , that &apos;s unexpected .
trust me , yeah .
callie ...
hey , dad !
happy birthday . sorry i &apos;m late .
thank you .
no !
i guess i missed the big moment , huh ?
don &apos;t worry about it . did you see soph ?
why did you guys not come together ?
i had a work thing .
callie , sorry to interrupt ...
becka has another present for you .
go .
the party &apos;s out there , you know ?
i &apos;m just taking a break .
so , what do you think of your new foster brother ?
not much . why ?
he &apos;s cute .
objectively , he &apos;s cute .
i didn &apos;t make the rules .
so what ? you don &apos;t like him ? why not ?
well , for one , he stole something from me .
something worth a lot of money .
do your moms know ?
um ... no .
he gave it back .
but i still think he &apos;s full of crap .
so why not tell them ?
i should &apos;ve , but i ...
i can &apos;t now . i had to sell it ...
to replace something i lost .
specific much ?
and my moms can &apos;t find out about it .
so there &apos;s nothing i can do .
well , there &apos;s got to be something .
okay , so this is your immediate future . okay ?
two of cups ?
you &apos;re going to have coffee .
great .
it actually means romance .
that &apos;s unlikely .
well , it could also mean friendship .
well , now you &apos;re just guessing .
i mean , so this card is the final outcome .
okay .
what does it mean ?
chaos , upheaval and downfall .
happy birthday .
see that bulge in his pocket ?
uh , no .
not that bulge . gross .
right front pocket .
his phone . should have all the proof
that you need to show your dad that he &apos;s lying , right ?
so ?
so , you need to get it .
right , yeah . i &apos;ll just go up to him and be like ,
&quot; hey , a.j. , can i borrow your phone ?
i &apos;d like to check the call history . &quot;
it &apos;s a fair point .
everything all right with you and certain surprise guest ?
you can say his name .
and he actually asked me out .
really ? and ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean ...
he &apos;s nice and cute and ...
he doesn &apos;t think callie would care .
said i should just ask her .
and what do you think ?
well , let &apos;s say i do ask her ...
and let &apos;s say she &apos;s cool with wyatt and i getting together , and ...
then maybe you don &apos;t have to tell callie
that you already got together .
well , if it doesn &apos;t bother callie now ,
then that means it wouldn &apos;t bother her then , right ?
you &apos;re gonna make a really great lawyer someday .
is that really how you want to handle this ?
hey , guys .
hey , honey .
okay , so you remember the &apos; 98 sedan we were looking at ?
the guy just texted me back and he &apos;s bringing it over .
when ?
in an hour .
well , you can &apos;t just test drive a car in the middle of your party .
no one &apos;s gonna notice if we &apos;re gone a few minutes .
whose birthday is it anyway ? come on .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good . how are you ?
how &apos;s everything at the center ?
good , yeah . real good .
how &apos;s callie doing ?
good . yeah . she &apos;s doing good .
let me ask you something ...
where was callie when i dropped off carmen last week ?
i had to let callie go .
i thought she was doing really well .
yeah . she was .
she was doing great .
so what happened ?
he did .
and who is he ?
her new foster brother .
here you go .
thanks .
if , uh ...
if ty calls ... when he calls , you &apos;d let me know , right ?
right .
okay .
another round of burgers are up if you &apos;re hungry .
uh , no , thanks . i think i &apos;ll save room for cake .
i wanted to tell you how sorry lena ...
and i were to hear about you and jill .
were you ? sorry ?
i never had any intention of telling jill .
stef , you were blackmailing me .
it was a risk i couldn &apos;t take .
well , i am still sorry to hear about the separation .
but you were the one who chose to have an affair .
how &apos; bout this ?
we put on a slow song ...
i &apos;ll ask a.j. to dance ...
i &apos;ll snuggle up to him , and you know ...
grab his phone out of his pocket .
um , no , you &apos;re 15 .
i &apos;m not pimping you out just to prove my dad wrong .
fine . you want to dance with him ?
or ... we could just unplug
his phone from the charger and take it .
it &apos;s got everything we need .
yeah , including a big dent in the bumper .
which gives a character .
it &apos;s time that we negotiate .
so ? what do you think ?
it &apos;s yours for $ 1,350 .
we &apos;ll take it .
what happened to negotiating ?
um , we just have to get some money out from the bank ...
uh , do you think you can hold it until tomorrow ?
that works .
call me in the morning .
perfect .
will do .
we just bought a car .
i know !
where &apos;s that from ?
it &apos;s from a box of old photos my dad just gave me .
oh ! it &apos;s great to have those .
i can &apos;t get over the bowl cut . i mean , honestly ...
and look at how happy she is smiling there .
when she was a kid , callie was obsessed with her birthdays .
and , apparently , the little mermaid as well .
it was never just one day .
she always made it like her birth @-@ week .
and one time she even made it her birth @-@ month .
well ... you threw a very nice party .
good job .
i saw you talking to robert .
yeah . apparently it &apos;s my fault
that he and jill separated because ...
i threatened to tell her about the affair .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
like what ?
i know that you think what i did was wrong .
you can add that to your hate list .
honey , i really wish you would stop calling it a hate list .
that &apos;s what it feels like .
i &apos;m pretty sure that
it defeats the purpose of the exercise .
what ? i &apos;m sorry about that .
hey , we need more buns .
here it is .
you know what , mike , take a break .
i got it .
did i walk in on something ?
no , it &apos;s fine . we &apos;re going to couples counseling .
really ?
everything all right ?
yeah , it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just the therapist has us making lists
of everything that we love and h ...
don &apos;t like about each other .
that sounds like a bad idea .
you &apos;ve agreed to this ?
what could i say ?
that &apos;s what married couples do , right ?
i know .
i should &apos;ve agreed to go to counseling with you .
i got it .
well , in hindsight though ,
no amount of therapy was going to turn you into a woman .
wait , wait . if i was a woman , you think we &apos;d still be together ?
oh , god , no . that &apos;s funny .
you didn &apos;t have to answer that fast .
is it weird having wyatt here ?
no . no , we &apos;re cool now .
that &apos;s nice .
so , question for you ...
okay ?
it just occurred to me , today ...
you know , since wyatt &apos;s single and cute ...
and now i &apos;m single and cute ...
you wouldn &apos;t care if i ever went out with him , would you ?
i mean , only if you don &apos;t mind .
you just broke up with mat .
i know , but i was thinking that maybe , if i started dating again ,
it &apos;ll help me get over him .
um ... wyatt and i are just friends now .
are you sure ?
yeah .
no record of any incoming or outgoing calls ...
no texts ... wow .
he &apos;s erased everything . he &apos;s covering his tracks .
well , maybe there &apos;s a way to find out what he deleted .
okay , now , charlie &apos;s angels . come on .
hey ! got a sec ?
uh , sure .
so , um ... i talked to callie ...
and ?
and you were right ...
she &apos;s totally cool with us .
so ...
so ...
you want to go out with me ?
i mean , if you &apos;re into the whole french cowboy thing ...
of course , i do .
oui ...
oui .
having fun ?
yeah .
you don &apos;t sound so sure about that .
i think mariana wants to go out with wyatt .
why do you say that ?
&apos;cause she asked me if it was okay .
oh ! what did ... what did you say ?
that it &apos;s fine .
is it ?
i mean , it &apos;s kinda weird .
my sister and my ex @-@ boyfriend .
hey ! where &apos;s my phone ?
i haven &apos;t seen it .
are you sure about that ?
give it to me . now !
who is this ? huh ?
who &apos;s calling ?
how the hell am i supposed to know ,
you got my phone ?
hello !
i said give it to me .
who is this , your brother ?
brandon ! brandon !
what &apos;s going on ?
he tried to steal my phone .
he freaked out &apos; cause i answered the phone .
what are you doing answering his phone , brandon ?
it &apos;s like i told you . he &apos;s talking to his brother ...
or someone else that he doesn &apos;t want you to know about .
give me the phone !
okay , everyone ...
hi , did you just call ?
yeah , don &apos;t call this number again , okay ?
just some kid who saw the number on the water tower .
what are you doing ?
i ... i ... i was worried ...
worried about what ?
there &apos;s nothing to worry about , okay ?
stay the hell out of it , brandon !
you okay ? what was that about ?
that guy doesn &apos;t want me here , okay ?
he don &apos;t like me .
i &apos;m really sorry he did that .
you know , word of advice , now that you &apos;ve got two kids ...
you can &apos;t play favorites .
i know you &apos;re trying to show a.j. that you trust him ...
but you can &apos;t do that at brandon &apos;s expense .
uh , hi . can i talk to you for a sec ?
sure .
hey ! you got another party you &apos;re going to ?
no , i , uh ...
i &apos;m just letting my mom know when to pick me up .
oh , your dad can &apos;t take you home ? where is he ?
i don &apos;t want him to .
okay .
why not ?
did you know that , um ...
that he cheated on my mom ?
you know , i totally remember ...
the first time i realized that my dad was human .
and man , it was hard ...
seeing him actually make mistakes .
it &apos;s just so humiliating .
no one ... no one thinks that
this has anything to do with you , i promise you .
and , uh ...
it doesn &apos;t mean that your dad loves you any less .
i know that for a fact .
i hope you &apos;ll stay around for cake ... yeah ?
we need to break up .
i &apos;m kidding .
but , i don &apos;t think we should do this .
why ?
because callie said that she was okay with it ...
but she &apos;s not .
i hear a.j. got you fired .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not gonna narc on you .
that &apos;s up to you to do .
i &apos;m gonna ... i just wanted to have ... yeah .
you &apos;ll find the right time .
callie ... why is he in your house ?
i was trying to help him .
you know ...
you are so good at taking care of other people .
just once ...
i &apos;d like to see you take care of yourself .
i really don &apos;t want to talk to you right now .
all right .
okay , but look ...
something happened the other day ,
when a.j. was with me in the squad car ...
and i guess i &apos;m just ...
sensitive to people accusing him ...
okay , but what about me ?
you seem pretty fine of accusing me of just about anything .
i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t mean to accuse you ...
save it for the son you wish you had .
you know , you &apos;ve been here
to see him more in the last few weeks
than you &apos;ve ever come to see me in the last few years .
i was ... just ...
looking out for you . it won &apos;t happen again .
look , brandon , i &apos;m sorry .
i screwed up .
i &apos;m new to this . i don &apos;t know how to parent you kids .
it &apos;s a big change , i know .
i need you to understand ,
i &apos;m never gonna choose anyone over you .
okay ?
you know , the entire time that we went out ,
all you did was yank me around .
i was understanding ... i was patient .
i did everything that you ever asked me to do ...
just for you to dump me .
now you &apos;re not gonna let mariana date me either ?
i already told mariana ,
if you two want to date ,
i don &apos;t have any rights to stand in your way . okay ?
you &apos;re right . you don &apos;t !
no .
&apos;cause we didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
what ?
and honestly , i &apos;m really tired of all this stressing ,
about whether you &apos;re gonna get upset about something .
what do you mean , do anything wrong , wyatt ?
what ? when ?
she &apos;s been so scared ...
that you would find out and get all upset .
like you said , you don &apos;t have any right to be ,
so i don &apos;t even know why we &apos;re keeping this a secret .
keeping what a secret ?
that mariana and i hooked up ...
at the end @-@ of @-@ school party .
what do you mean you hooked up ?
* happy birthday to you *
callie !
* happy birthday to you *
you good ? come on .
* happy birthday , dear callie *
* happy birthday to you *
stop eating all of it .
you had sex with wyatt ?
i ... can we go somewhere ?
what ? you don &apos;t want people to hear ?
no , i just ... i just want to explain .
there &apos;s nothing to explain , mariana .
look , i am so sorry .
if you were fine with me and wyatt dating
then ... is the sex thing really that big a deal ?
i mean , it was a mistake , and it only happened once .
and what about lying to me ? is that a one time thing , too ?
i told you i lost my virginity ...
you assumed that it was mat , so ...
what ? did i really lie ?
this isn &apos;t a negotiation , mariana .
okay , if you wanna date wyatt ...
it doesn &apos;t really matter to me , okay ?
but don &apos;t pretend like you care what i think .
no ... look , i don &apos;t want to date wyatt .
i just thought ...
that in this case my permission
would be easier to get than my forgiveness ?
no ! i just thought that ...
if he was my boyfriend ...
i wouldn &apos;t be that girl that lost it to ,
you know , some random guy she barely knows .
i &apos;d be the girl that lost her virginity to her boyfriend .
someone i can maybe ...
eventually love ...
the way i love mat .
i was gonna tell you .
i swear .
i was ... just not today .
i didn &apos;t want to ruin your party .
oh , the big surprise party i didn &apos;t want ?
it &apos;s a little late for that , mariana .
hey ! just the girl i &apos;m looking for .
can i borrow you for a second ?
yeah , sure .
okay . come on .
here .
brandon was right .
i &apos;ve been talking to ty .
okay ?
look ...
if you want to run ...
and i really hope you don &apos;t ...
but if you do , there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back in touch with ty .
all i ask is that you keep me in the loop .
what &apos;s going on ?
wait . give me one sec .
happy birthday .
sorry about the bow ...
i don &apos;t know where they get those giant ones .
you got me a car ?
yeah ! you like it ?
i do !
i will handle the insurance , don &apos;t worry ,
but the gas is all you .
i wasn &apos;t sure if you like red .
i think cops pull over the color red more than any other ,
but hey , that might be a good thing .
keep you from speeding .
uh , i can &apos;t take it .
why not ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair on the other kids in the family ,
and i kinda made a deal with mariana ,
we &apos;re gonna get a car together .
i don &apos;t really wanna go back on that .
you might be the only teenager
that turned down a car , like ...
sorry .
... ever .
it &apos;s so sweet , though .
you &apos;re a good kid .
so will you be able to take it back ?
probably not .
but sophia &apos;s gonna be driving soon , so ...
i , uh ...
i told her ... about the affair .
she was really lashing out at her mom
about the whole separation and i just ...
... felt like i owed her the truth , you know ?
of course , now she &apos;s not talking to me .
you know , the best gift you ever gave me ...
is even when i was so mad at you ...
and even when i told you to leave me alone ...
you never did .
where are you going ?
connor &apos;s .
oh , you &apos;re leaving my party ?
the party you never wanted ? yeah , i am .
jude , i didn &apos;t mean it .
no , i love that you did all this , really ...
it &apos;s just , all these people paying attention to me ...
it &apos;s a lot .
you used to love your birthdays .
yeah .
i guess i don &apos;t really remember that girl anymore .
well , i guess , i have to remember her for you .
okay . i have one more surprise for you .
though , you might hate it .
i remember it wasn &apos;t a birthday party
unless mom and dad got you one of these .
sorry ...
you &apos;re kidding ?

here &apos;s that piece of cake that you &apos;ve been holding out for .
thanks .
you know , everything that i did ...
during the custody battle ...
i keep telling myself it was all justified ...
look , stef , i don &apos;t blame the problems in my marriage on you ...
no , no , no . that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying . i ...
you &apos;ve been really good to callie ...
and you &apos;ve proven yourself to be an honorable man
and what i did , it was not ...
honorable .
hey , how &apos;d she like the car ?
callie knows .
you told her ?
i don &apos;t think she &apos;ll ever stop being mad at me .
well , she doesn &apos;t look too mad right now .
go ! bounce with your sister .
you &apos;ll be happy to know that i apologized to robert .
nice . add that to my love list .
oh , good . at least you &apos;ll have something on that list .
honey ... almost everything i write ends up on the love list .
it does . i ...
whenever i think of something that drives me crazy about you ...
i immediately want to come to your defense ,
because i know why you &apos;re quick to react ,
because you &apos;re protecting our family ,
and i know why sometimes you snap , because
you &apos;re stressed
from taking care of everybody .
i don &apos;t think those lists were meant
to make us focus on all the bad stuff .
rita &apos;s done !
i never gave you a present .
&quot; super callie &quot; ?
i know it &apos;s stupid , but marvel already took all the good names .
you &apos;re such a dork .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know nothing &apos;s gonna happen while we &apos;re under the same roof .
well , there &apos;s no roof here .
