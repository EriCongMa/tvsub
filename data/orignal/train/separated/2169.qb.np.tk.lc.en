all units , be advised ,
in pursuit of silver camaro
heading east on pokukaina .
suspect now heading north on coral street .
requesting backup .
all available units requested for immediate assistance .
kono , give me your phone .
this is a burner , all right ? keep it on you .
lay low . we &apos;re gonna straighten this out .
we &apos;re gonna find you as soon as we can . you got it ?
okay .
everybody stand down !
where &apos;s kono ?
no idea .
steve , she was seen getting inside your car
outside the palace .
pop the trunk .
i know you want to protect her ,
but kono &apos;s wanted
for questioning in the murder of victor asanuma .
i got to bring her in .
duke , come on .
you really think she had anything to do with that ?
the crime lab matched the ballistics to her gun .
how do you explain that ?
michael noshimuri used her gun to pull off the murder .
he set her up .
victor asanuma was
the star witness in michael &apos;s manslaughter trial .
duke , you and i both know he &apos;s the one who pulled the trigger .
that may be true , steve ,
but kono &apos;s in a relationship with adam noshimuri .
his father was a yakuza boss for 30 years .
the prosecuting attorney thinks maybe she did
her boyfriend &apos;s brother a solid by taking care of his problem .
duke , you tell the prosecuting attorney
we &apos;ll deliver him the real killer ,
we just need some time .
i hope you know what you &apos;re doing , steve .
you know what you &apos;re doing , right ?
mcgarrett .
hpd is all over me about kono .
well , you tell them you don &apos;t know anything , all right ?
like they &apos;d believe me .
oh , listen to me .
we just got to keep our stories consistent , okay ?
that &apos;s all .
just tell me about this plane .
hickam picked up an unidentified aircraft .
f @-@ 22s were scrambled , but before they could intercept it ,
the plane landed here .
no markings , no logos , just a tail number .
no . it &apos;s not registered with the faa either .
so we don &apos;t know who flew the plane
or where it was coming from .
all we got are bodies .
we have five dead .
three were killed by sharp @-@ force trauma--
either stabbed or their throats were slit .
the two others were shot .
whoever killed these guys also landed this plane .
know anything else about the victims ?
no cell phones or wallets on them .
i &apos;m thinking our suspect must have taken them off the bodies .
also three of our vics have empty holsters .
seem odd to anyone ?
not if it was a rendition flight .
what makes you think that ?
plane &apos;s unregistered , right ?
there &apos;s no flight recorder in the cockpit .
i &apos;m thinking these five guys were government agents ,
the killer is their rendition suspect--
somebody resourceful enough
to be able to kill five feds , then land a jet .
that &apos;s one serious national security threat .
yeah , and now he &apos;s loose on the island .
steve , so i ran your victims
through the national security database .
there id &apos;s as g.s. aids through the department of agriculture .
that &apos;s got to be a cia cover .
what about the plane &apos;s registration number ?
the tail number &apos;s registered
to a webster @-@ cole leasing out of wilmington , delaware .
it &apos;s an executive transpo company .
word is is that it &apos;s a cia front company
and the feds are using it to transfer ghost detainees
to black sites for interrogations .
apparently , it was en route from brisbane to cuba .
i &apos;ve got nothing yet on the prisoner that they &apos;re renditioning .
you get anything off the bloody prints we found
on the plane &apos;s steering wheel ?
yoke .
what ?
it &apos;s called a yoke .
the yoke .
yeah , i ran them , but there were no matches
in any of our print databases .
well , of course there wasn &apos;t .
the cia doesn &apos;t want him to exist .
good . all we got to do is find an anonymous maniac
who butchered five people from getting off the island .
hey , listen , i got to run , but ,
um , i @-@ i &apos;ll be here if you need anything , okay ?
all right . hey , you !
hey . i was just coming to find you .
what are you doing here in hawaii ?
i am done .
like , done done ?
yep . in a few weeks ,
this thing goes in the closet .
i &apos;m through collecting a government check .
so what &apos;s the next chapter in the life of billy harrington ?
how about i tell you over dinner ?
i &apos;m seeing someone .
mcgarrett .
in amsterdam , you told me that was over .
it was .
and what happened between you and me was real .
and i &apos;ll never regret amsterdam
or working together in kabul ,
but it &apos;s been five years , billy .
things change .
if things change again , i &apos;ll be staying at the ilikai .
it was good to see you .
you , too .
commander , my name is luis braga .
i run the latin american counterterrorism desk here at langley .
why is lieutenant rollins asking questions
about a flight that doesn &apos;t exist ?
your nonexistent flight just landed in hawaii
with five dead aboard .
what ? !
you didn &apos;t know ?
we were transferring a high @-@ value target on that flight .
we keep communications to a minimum for security .
just a suggestion :
maybe you ought to pay closer attention ,
&apos;cause your high @-@ value target is now in the wind .
mr. braga , we can help you ,
but you have to come clean with us .
who is the prisoner ?
rafael salgado .
what do we know about him ?
ever heard of nlm ?
national liberation movement--
latin american terrorist organization .
salgado &apos;s got ten years in .
he was picked up brokering an arms deal in australia
because we think he has knowledge about an upcoming attack .
an attack ? where ?
our intel suggests it &apos;s domestic ,
on american soil ,
and it &apos;s going down soon .
okay , what do you want us to do ?
i &apos;m sending an action team to hawaii
as we speak ,
but for now , i need you to carry the ball .
but remember , we need salgado alive .
it &apos;s the only way we &apos;ll stop that attack .
whose house ?
my family owns it through a holding company .
who else knows that ?
just family .
thanks for picking this up .
kono , you should still be in the hospital .
it &apos;s not really an option .
hpd &apos;s looking for me .
they think i killed victor asanuma .
why do they think you &apos;re involved ?
&apos;cause we found his remains
in a barrel in a dockside warehouse .
single tap to the head .
crime lab tested the bullet ,
and it was fired from my gun .
what ?
how ?
your brother .
after he got out of prison ,
we were under the same roof for a couple of nights .
he must have taken my gun
and then returned it to my holster .
did you know he was gonna do that to me ?
do you actually think i &apos;d let him do that to you ?
i don &apos;t know what to think .
you haven &apos;t exactly been transparent with me lately .
hey , if anyone should be questioning loyalty here ,
it &apos;s me .
you used my phone to spy on me .
adam , i want to believe you .
from the beginning , you said
you want out of the family business ,
but from everything i &apos;m seeing ,
you &apos;ve taken over from your father as the oyabun .
kono , i told you ...
everything i &apos;m doing is to protect us .
michael &apos;s putting together an army to fight me
for control of our enterprises .
i need our partners to think i &apos;m still in charge .
i thought you were trying to legitimize the business .
i am . kono , i promise you , i am .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
my father &apos;s allies stand to lose a lot of money ,
so i need to make those moves very quietly .
if they see me as weak ,
i &apos;m dead .
i &apos;ll call you back .
what do you got ?
pulled the cell phone records of our dead cia operatives .
one of the phones was used right after the plane landed .
tried to ping it ,
but it looks like it was turned off right after the calls were made .
made to where ?
five @-@ o !
who are you ?
five @-@ o.
rafael salgado-- where is he ?
who ?
rafael salgado .
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s pedro .
pedro ?
yeah , that &apos;s pedro silva .
how do you know him ?
he &apos;s my son &apos;s father , but ... but i haven &apos;t seen him in years .
we know he called you twice in the last hour .
no . i @-@ i received some calls ,
but they were hang @-@ ups .
he called to see if she was home .
where &apos;s your boy ?
excuse me ?
your son . where is he ?
jack &apos;s upstairs . he &apos;s playing in his room .
oh , my god .
where is he ?
where &apos;s jack ?
where &apos;s my son ?
how long were you two together ?
just my sophomore year .
we were ...
both studying literature in peru .
pedro was very political .
i didn &apos;t realize how radical he was
until he was implicated in a bombing on campus .
two people were killed ,
and i was pregnant with his baby .
so then you came here .
i got as far away as i could . i didn &apos;t ...
i didn &apos;t want my child
to be associated with a murderer .
jack ...
jack is all that i &apos;ve got .
just get my son back , please .
something &apos;s not adding up here .
i mean , clearly , salgado knew about his son the whole time .
so why show up now , when the feds are after him ?
apb is out .
tsa &apos;s been alerted .
all right , so we got a terrorist
who &apos;s on the run with a little kid .
he &apos;s got limited resources , and he &apos;s smart enough
not to contact any of his known associates
&apos;cause he knows that we &apos;ll be monitoring .
well , then who does salgado reach out to for help ?
no idea .
but i think i know someone who might .
you look tired , steve .
something keeping you up at night ?
a loss of nerve , perhaps ?
i sleep fine .
you know this man ?
should i ?
he &apos;s an nlm terrorist .
his name is rafael salgado .
i &apos;m familiar with the nlm .
they claim to be ideologically driven ,
but i think they &apos;re just a bunch of thugs and peasants .
this morning , salgado killed five men and kidnapped his son .
i can &apos;t imagine what he has planned for the afternoon .
how do i find him ?
what makes you think i can answer that ?
a high @-@ value target like this won &apos;t last long on his own .
he needs friends--
the kind of relationships you used to cultivate .
so if you were him , who would you go to for help ?
you &apos;ve come here to ask about a case ?
is that all you want to talk about ?
i &apos;m giving you the chance to save a little boy &apos;s life .
and what &apos;s in it for me ?
the exercise yard .
15 minutes a day .
you &apos;ll get to see the sun again .
i burn easily .
okay .
let &apos;s go at this another angle .
you help me ...
or i discontinue your pain medication .
what &apos;s next ?
no dessert ?
there &apos;s a gentleman named arturo casey in waikiki .
he controls an international investment company
called outrigger securities .
makes most of his money off the books .
doing what ?
he traffics in arms , explosives ,
chemical weapons , identity papers .
very resourceful , i &apos;m told .
hey , that &apos;s funny ,
you &apos;re the second mcgarrett we &apos;ve had here in 48 hours .
what do you mean-- second mcgarret ?
doris mcgarrett . you two related ?
she came in yesterday morning .
people who worked for my father
used this place as a supply depot .
if there &apos;s proof my brother killed victor asanuma ,
it &apos;s going to be in here somewhere .
adam .
you got something ?
get out of sight .
brother ?
what are you doing here ?
i need a gun . i got heat .
how much heat ?
a lot .
cops are asking questions about those bodies
they dug up .
even kono doesn &apos;t trust me .
she cloned my damn phone .
i need to protect myself .
you got something ?
if you needed a piece , you should &apos;ve come directly to me .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing here .
s &amp; w j @-@ frame .
reliable as a rooster in the morning .
clean , too .
what are you doing ?
give me the gun .
it &apos;s only a five @-@ shot , so make sure
you &apos;re close enough to make each one count .
something wrong ?
i told you .
no .
something else ?
why ?
should there be ?
i was just asking .
thanks , brother .
appreciate it .
you okay ?
yeah .
what was michael doing in there ?
after you left , he searched the van .
i think he was looking for these .
michael must have left them there .
is that blood ?
yeah , and dirt .
if we can match the blood to asanuma
and the dirt to the body dump ,
that might be enough to take the heat off of me .
and help prove michael pulled the trigger .
i &apos;m sorry , adam .
everyone &apos;s looking for you , kono .
that &apos;s why i called you .
i need a favor .
what kind of favor ?
i need you to run these for dna .
i &apos;m fighting for my life , charlie .
evidence on these gloves could put me in the clear .
all right .
thanks .
i don &apos;t know who the hell you think you are ,
but you just can &apos;t walk into my office
and arrest me for no reason .
i &apos;ll have your badge , you hear me ?
okay , mr. casey , here &apos;s the thing :
usually i &apos;d dance with you for a while in here ,
but i don &apos;t have any time today , okay ?
so do me a favor , tell me ,
rafael salgado-- where is he ?
never heard of him . how would i know ?
because , despite the expensive suit
and the nice watch , you &apos;re just the type of
morally bankrupt low @-@ life scumbag
who would give him a car , some cash and a fake i.d. , okay ?
so you &apos;ve got one minute exactly
to tell me everything you know .
and what happens if i decide not to cooperate ?
well , it &apos;s simple . i &apos;m gonna let you go .
beautiful .
we &apos;re on the same page .
not quite .
right after i let you go ,
i &apos;m gonna spread the word that you were in here ,
cooperating with five @-@ o.
and when i tell them
that you were squealing like a pig to save your own skin ,
every animal you &apos;ve ever helped
is gonna start crawling out of the woodwork .
and they &apos;ve gonna come back and put a bullet in you ,
your wife and your two kids .
did you just threaten my family ?
30 seconds .
you &apos;d have me killed ?
this is ridiculous .
20 seconds .
i &apos;ve got rights !
the supreme court says you do not have rights
when you provide material support
for a foreign terrorist network .
but i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re paying attention ,
&apos;cause you have seven seconds .
time &apos;s up .
wait .
danny ! hey .
listen , casey said salgado is driving
a black 2010 escalade , okay ?
plate number is alpha @-@ zulu @-@ two @-@ five @-@ three @-@ one .
all right ?
okay .
alert hpd , and call catherine after that ,
see if she can locate it via satellite .
okay , whoa , whoa , whoa .
wo fat just gives you this guy , arturo casey--
i mean , what if he &apos;s playing you ?
he &apos;s not playing me .
listen , now that he &apos;s behind bars ,
he &apos;s scared that casey &apos;s gonna poach his turf .
that &apos;s why he gave him up in the first place .
this is not about him helping us ,
it &apos;s about him helping himself .
steve .
just got your message .
what &apos;s so important ?
my office . now .
okay .
you went to see wo fat .
why would you do that ?
answer my question !
don &apos;t yell at me , please , steve .
no , no .
don &apos;t give me the hurt feelings thing , mom , okay ?
because &quot; a , &quot; i don &apos;t buy it , and &quot; b , &quot; i don &apos;t care .
tell me right now . what could you possibly have
to say to that man ?
okay .
i just wanted to look the man in the eye
who orchestrated your dad &apos;s murder .
changed the course of your life , steve .
it all started with me .
if i hadn &apos;t killed wo fat &apos;s father , then ...
everything would be different .
i got to say , for a former spy , you &apos;re , uh ...
you &apos;re not very good at this at all .
what ?
lying , mom .
i pulled the surveillance video
from the prison .
the audio was scrambled purposefully ,
and your back was conveniently to the camera .
just tell me one thing .
how &apos;d you get the scrambling device past the guards ?
i can &apos;t work that one out .
you know , if we &apos;re gonna
be in each other &apos;s lives , steve ,
you &apos;re gonna have to learn to trust me .
you have literally never given me the whole truth .
ever in my life .
and you want me to trust you ?
the night wo fat
came after you , you told me
that you two struggled over the gun and he got away .
that was another lie .
i know for a fact that you let him go that night , doris .
now , why don &apos;t you tell me right now
why you would do something like that .
why don &apos;t you tell me right now who he is to you !
okay , okay ...
hey ... hey , we got a fix on salgado &apos;s car .
catherine &apos;s gonna put a satellite on it .
okay , thanks .
to be continued .
okay .
all right , i &apos;ve got your black suburban heading
westbound on harding .
left on waialae , right on palolo .
where &apos;s he going , cath ?
somewhere up the ridge .
there &apos;s only one road in and out .
get me a roadblock on palolo and kiwila .
get out of the car !
out !
on your knees , hands behind your head .
interlock your fingers .
where &apos;s the boy ?
where &apos;s jack ?
get up .
where is he ?
huh ?
they took him .
mi hijo . they took my boy .
we know about the phone calls to lyla , to see if she was home
so you could grab your son .
no .
you &apos;re lying .
i &apos;m not lying .
i didn &apos;t take jack .
okay , well , here &apos;s the part i don &apos;t get .
could &apos;ve hijacked that plane
to a non @-@ extradition country .
why would you come here and risk getting caught
just to go and kidnap a son you never met ?
because i didn &apos;t come to kidnap him .
i came here to protect him .
protect him from who ?
from the nlm .
they knew the cia picked you up in australia ,
and they went after your kid , didn &apos;t they ?
i was too late .
they got to him first .
makes sense .
kidnapping is a tactic consistent
with nlm security measures .
if an operative is captured , a hit squad is sent
to secure his family as collateral .
so they &apos;re holding salgado &apos;s son right now to make sure
he does not divulge the target of their attack .
the priority is extracting information .
keep salgado detained .
my team is on ground and will be there
any minute to interrogate him .
okay , but he &apos;s not gonna give you anything
if he knows it means his son is going to die .
my men can be very persuasive .
with all due respect , sir ,
i agree with detective williams .
the best way to get salgado to talk and to talk quickly
is to convince him we can get his son back .
commander , i don &apos;t know what it is you have in mind ,
but it &apos;s not happening .
i &apos;m not taking any chances with thousands
of lives at stake , even if it means salgado &apos;s son has to die .
i &apos;m sorry ?
is that perfectly clear , gentlemen ?
yeah , it &apos;s perfectly clear-- connection &apos;s no good .
did you just hang up on the cia ?
no , no , i , uh , hung up on a schmuck .
a gigantic schmuck .
all right , we &apos;re out of time .
so listen carefully .
you killed five cia operatives .
you murdered hundreds of civilians .
the only choice you have left now is whether or not
you want your son &apos;s blood on your hands , too .
all right , you want a chance at being a father ,
here &apos;s your shot .
you give us the target ,
we get your son back-- that is my offer .
why should i trust you ?
you should trust us &apos; cause you don &apos;t have a choice , okay ?
clearly this kid means something to you , so ...
what time is it ?
3 : 27 .
i was on the way to meet the men who took my son
when you picked me up .
all right , what &apos;d they want ?
my life in exchange for his .
you believe them ?
that is the way we operate .
okay , when &apos;s the meet ?
4 : 00 . a farm in kaneohe .
if i &apos;m a minute late , they &apos;ll put a bullet in my boy .
we can get to kaneohe in less than 30 minutes ,
but you have got to give us something .
what is the target ?
what &apos;s the target ? !
san francisco .
san francisco ? what ...
where @-@ where in san francisco ?
trust goes both ways , yeah ?
i &apos;ll tell you that once my son is free .
catherine , get word out to the authorities in san francisco .
tell them the nlm are planning an attack .
braga &apos;s people just pulled up outside .
okay , they &apos;re gonna make us hand him over .
no . if you hand me over now ,
hundreds of people will die , not just my son .
we have a deal , you made a promise .
let &apos;s go .
they got the parking lot covered !
out of the car .
out of the car , let &apos;s go !
five @-@ o. we need your car , buddy . let &apos;s go .
it &apos;s fong .
hey , charlie , tell me you got something .
i processed those gloves
you gave me and found two sets of dna .
on the outside , i got a donor match
to our victim victor asanuma .
and the dna on the inside came back to michael noshimuri .
looks like we found our killer .
okay , charlie , i need you to get that evidence
to mcgarrett right away .
copy that .
and charlie ?
yeah , kono ?
you &apos;re a good friend .
mahalo .
how did you get in here ?
i think those belong to me .
you need to leave . now !
or i &apos;m calling security .
hang up .
where &apos;s my son ?
you are two minutes late .
i &apos;m not exactly familiar with this place .
or maybe you decided to make a stop
and talk to the cops ?
i did what you asked .
i &apos;m here .
now let my son go .
not in front of my boy .
please .
the deal was my life
for his .
we lied .
no !
no , no , no , no , no .
stay with me .
the target in san francisco-- where is it ?
what is the target ?
what is the target ?
listen to me .
this man cannot die .
you understand me ?
he cannot die .
steve !
max , what are you doing here ?
someone broke into the crime lab , charlie fong was stabbed .
what ?
it &apos;s bad , steve ,
they don &apos;t know if he &apos;s gonna make it .
we &apos;re trying to stabilize your prisoner ,
but he &apos;s demanding to talk to commander mcgarrett .
excuse me , excuse me .
i got the target .
hey , go , hide .
kono ?
get away from her !
thank you for finding these .
where did you get those ?
she asked you a question , michael .
your girlfriend tried to burn me .
and you let her .
you started this , michael ,
when you stole her gun to kill the man that put you in jail .
he had to go . and so does she .
i was only trying to save your life .
how does putting her away for murder save my life ?
you &apos;ve had a target on your back
ever since you crawled in bed with her .
and all i &apos;ve done is try to protect you .
not anymore .
it stops now .
tonight she dies ...
... i take over the business ,
and you &apos;re on your own .
no ! no !
no !
adam !
brah .
department of homeland security , acting on information obtained
during an investigation ,
thwarted an attack at fisherman &apos;s wharf tonight .
the attack was planned for 8 : 00 p.m. ,
taking advantage of the peak dinner @-@ hour crowd .
mommy !
thank you .
how &apos;s fong ?
he &apos;s in surgery .
it &apos;s still too early to tell .
it &apos;s all my fault .
he &apos;s strong , kono ; he &apos;ll pull through .
where &apos;s adam ?
you need to leave . now .
adam ...
the guys who work for your brother
are gonna want payback .
all right ?
yeah .
okay , guys , we &apos;re all good .
once we get to shanghai , i &apos;ll take you inland .
and don &apos;t worry ,
nobody &apos;s ever gonna find you .
how long ?
as long as it takes
to put all your enemies behind bars .
i &apos;m going with you .
kono , you can &apos;t go with him , okay ?
we just cleared your name .
guy &apos;s about to go on the lam . it &apos;s not good .
i &apos;m not leaving adam .
okay , kono , you can &apos;t be serious .
you &apos;re not actually considering this , right ?
steve , don &apos;t stop her .
follow your heart .
i &apos;ll take good care of her .
i know you will .
it &apos;s not forever .
i &apos;ll take that as a promise ?
promise .
thank you .
i &apos;m seriously gonna miss you , sista .
take care of these boys for me .
be safe .
can i go with you guys , huh ?
that , i support . i support that .
mom , i-- can i talk to you for a sec ?
yeah .
i mean , he &apos;s just gonna end up getting himself shot ,
so i figure i got to stick around for that , eh ?
you &apos;d miss him in a week .
i don &apos;t think so .
why are you doing this ?
i get to help people you care about .
it &apos;s the least i could do .
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m talking about , okay ? listen to me .
you don &apos;t have to go with them , all right ?
you make a phone call , get them squared away .
you don &apos;t have to get on the boat .
yeah , but a phone call isn &apos;t gonna make people disappear .
and besides , my sources will only deal with me .
soon as i get them situated , i &apos;ll be back .
okay ? to be continued .
yeah , to be continued .
okay ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll miss you .
sometimes i wonder how different things would have been
if you hadn &apos;t blown out your knee .
cousin , i don &apos;t even know what life would be like
if i wasn &apos;t cop .
i love you , cuz .
aloha .
malama pono .
time to go .
okay .
are you sure ?
yeah .
leilani .
hi . it &apos;s , uh , chin ho kelly calling .
look , i know it &apos;s been a while .
yes , well , in my defense ,
you did say to call when i was ready .
yeah .
um , listen ,
i , uh , i can &apos;t promise anything as exciting as a prison riot ,
but , um , if you &apos;re still up for it ,
i &apos;d love to take you on a second date .
um , great .
i don &apos;t know what i was thinking .
thank you for coming , commander .
don &apos;t flatter yourself .
i was coming even if you hadn &apos;t asked .
yes .
you want to know why your mother paid me a visit .
i can answer that .
but first , you &apos;re going to do something for me .
and what &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re going to get me out of here .
is that so ?
you set me up ?
yes , but not in the way you think .

they &apos;re here to kill me .
and you &apos;re the only one who can protect me from them .
from who ?
