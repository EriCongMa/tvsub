it &apos;s about alicia .
that &apos;s what you care about more than anything .
peter helped you change your name
at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office when you worked there .
peter helped you change your name .
and you slept with him .
you &apos;re wrong .
that &apos;s good ,
because i told the asa ,
and of course , you know , they have their process .
they &apos;ll probably ... probably interview everyone involved ,
and they &apos;ll get it all straightened out .
see you around , kalinda .
hey . what happened ?
did you see blake ?
yeah .
what did he say ?
kalinda ?
nothing . just ...
just the usual .
i , um ...
are you all right ?
yeah .
alicia , where are you ?
home . why ?
do you want to talk ?
no . i &apos;ll , um ...
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow , yeah ?
yeah , it &apos;s me . what ?
cary ?
kalinda ?
what are you doing ?
what am i doing ?
i &apos;m making an omelet . what do you think ?
where are you ?
i need some help .
okay . now ?
did you see blake today ?
i mean , no . why ?
he said he was interviewed by an asa .
do you think you might know who that is ?
no .
but i wouldn &apos;t worry about it .
childs doesn &apos;t have a case anymore ,
and blake is awol .
cary , i think blake might have something on me .
and i think he might have told it to an asa .
can you find out ?
sure . what does he have on you ?
can you find out ?
sure .
thanks . bye .
so you think he &apos;s well ?
i believe that ,
based upon a reasonable degree of medical and psychiatric certainty
that he is no longer in need of any mental health services ,
inpatient or outpatient .
you do know that he tortured ,
raped and killed mallory cerone ?
i do .
mr. bowes was unwell
when he committed that crime 30 years ago .
he was found not guilty by reason of insanity
and committed to a psychiatric treatment center ,
and not to a prison .
didn &apos;t know you &apos;d be here .
i didn &apos;t know i would , either .
couldn &apos;t stay away .
for 30 years , he has been treated .
i can say without hesitation ,
he is a different man than the man who committed that crime .
oh , you mean , when he did this ?
don &apos;t look .
i &apos;ve seen them before .
you don &apos;t understand .
these photos are indeed horrifying .
but they were committed by an insane man .
this is the woman he tortured and killed .
i know .
and did you know her daughter is in court today ?
i did not know that .
i &apos;m sorry ... i know it &apos;s hard to hear ,
but justice has been done here .
the man who killed your mother no longer exists .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m very sorry .
he &apos;s out in a week .
so now it &apos;s up to you guys . keep him from getting rich .
we &apos;ll do our best .
uh , hey . alicia ,
tell kalinda to stop worrying about the grand jury .
i &apos;m not finding blake did any more interviews ,
so there shouldn &apos;t be any more subpoenas .
okay .
good to know . i &apos;ll tell her .
are you considering a divorce , ma &apos;am ?
do you think your husband should resign his congressional seat ?
please . i need to get my baby home .
the congressman &apos;s wife has still offered no comment
after months of revelations regarding his affair .
why are they still in the news ?
she should just divorce him and get it over with .
then people &apos;ll stop chasing her .
this is not good .
why ? it has nothing to do with you guys .
everything has to do with us guys .
voters are like amoebas .
they suck everything up and don &apos;t distinguish .
is that what amoebas do ?
so that &apos;s the other woman , huh ?
she &apos;s pretty .
of course she &apos;s pretty .
now this story will own the week . you know ,
i do have work to get on with here .
why does america suck ?
america does not suck .
people suck .
what , and you think israel will suck any less ?
it &apos;ll suck different .
so ...
that didn &apos;t end well , did it ?
there was nothing to end well or not well .
i went for dinner with her . that &apos;s all .
i was trying to find out if she was undocumented
when she worked as a nanny for wendy scott @-@ carr .
and she was .
so it was all just a political scheme ?
it was information @-@ gathering .
oh , come on , dad .
i saw your face . i saw how happy you were .
i have great control over my face .
i can make people believe ...
oh , i &apos;m so sorry . was i boring you ?
i have to go study .
don &apos;t misbehave .
control that face .
no , it &apos;s not her fault .
she &apos;s been an american since she was two years old .
natalie flores has become a flashpoint
for illinois illegal alien policy ,
which some have decried as the most lenient in the nation .
drive on out , drive on , now drive on out
and she makes the noises
you need to drive on out , just drive on out
the man heard voices
the girl is alone in the blink of an eye
he tell her to drive , drive , drive
and bitch , don &apos;t cry the city &apos;s too loud ...
and the lyrics were credited to him ?
to jarvis bowes . copyright 2010 .
the band dedicated the whole album to him .
how is it doing ?
currently number three on the billboard 200 .
and monetarily ?
bowes has $ 800,000 in royalties coming to him ,
but it &apos;ll go higher .
still not a lot .
you should hear from rhonda .
she isn &apos;t interested in the money .
she just wants to stop him from getting rich
from a song about killing her mom .
yes , i understand her reasoning . what &apos;s ours ?
this was one of bond &apos;s cases .
it looks good being on the side of angels suing a monster .
it &apos;ll draw some attention .
so , what , intentional infliction of emotional distress ?
worked in a few other states .
let &apos;s see if it works here .
he got out ?
he &apos;s being released next week .
and we &apos;re ready to go ?
bond had all the &quot; emotional distress &quot; arguments ready .
okay , but we can &apos;t keep carrying all of bond &apos;s cases .
you &apos;re signed off ?
i &apos;m signed off .
okay , so bowes &apos;s lawyer will argue
it &apos;s his first amendment right .
and if they lose that , they may go after the song itself ;
say it has nothing to do with the crime .
you want us to make sure
that the song is actually about the rape and murder ?
yes , whatever you can get
to connect the imagery to the crime .
we &apos;ll never use it , but just in case .
won &apos;t this be fun ...
finding clues in bad poetry .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not gonna comment .
about what ?
the colorado congressman and his skinny @-@ dipping girlfriend .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , right ?
no .
eli , come on in .
i don &apos;t understand .
her legal fight for citizenship was complicated by the recent ...
situation in the news ,
and i don &apos;t think her current lawyer is quite up to it .
this is natalie flores ?
yes , a de paul university student .
actually , ex @-@ student .
wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s nanny ?
yes .
ex @-@ nanny .
so , do you mind if i ask ?
the rumor is that your campaign was instrumental in
exposing her undocumented status .
yes , well , you know i can &apos;t comment on that .
but this has nothing to do with the campaign .
this is something i want handled .
sure .
i will call her , and offer our services .
great . thank you .
one more thing .
i &apos;d rather it wasn &apos;t mentioned
that i had anything to do with this .
if the press asks .
no , if she asks .
okay , good to know .
we value your business , eli .
you were thinking about running
for a judgeship at one point , weren &apos;t you ?
i was .
you should think about it again .
is it perverse ? i &apos;m sort of starting to like this .
that is perverse .
do you see any connections ?
carcass , kitchen sink ?
it &apos;s all too generic .
bloody gearshift .
yeah ,
that &apos;s one connection .
so cary checked to see
if there were any more interviews with blake ,
and he said he couldn &apos;t find any .
what ?
cary came up to me .
he said , &quot; you should just stop worrying about another subpoena . &quot;
okay .
what happened ? did blake said something ?
no .
you still have that bad feeling : something bad &apos;s gonna happen ?
no .
are you happy ?
am i happy ?
with your life , your home ?
i don &apos;t know .
i guess so .
it &apos;s like when a storm is over , is it happiness ,
or it just a relief ?
i don &apos;t understand .
we want to help you .
we &apos;ve been seeing you in the news .
we believe your case has been mishandled .
natalie , this is alicia florrick .
she &apos;s worked on other immigration cases .
i &apos;ve asked her to help here .
we are in a consortium of law firms
who promise a certain percentage
of pro bono hours each year , natalie ,
so we offer you this service free of charge .
why ?
why ?
because we think we can help you .
when did your parents bring you to the united states , miss flores ?
1986 .
you were two ?
yes .
the problem we &apos;re facing is this , natalie .
you know what the dream act is ?
i do ...
it &apos;s a path to citizenship for people like me .
yes , but its political defeat has made it paradoxically harder .
politicians are less willing to support the undocumented .
especially someone like you , with a high profile .
so you &apos;re going to need a sponsor
with three years of legal residence .
my aunt filed the i @-@ 864 form .
well , good .
the fact that your case was already in the works
should keep you out of any immediate trouble .
and we &apos;ll need you to have a job .
do you have one at the moment ?
i do . day trading .
day trading ?
uh , the @-@ the stock market ?
well , currency exchanges , too .
for clients ?
a few professors at school .
it &apos;s not a lot of money ,
but i do offer a fairly consistent 12 % return .
well , i was thinking more like a nanny job ,
but that should work , i would think .
you &apos;re peter florrick &apos;s wife .
i am .
do you know that i used to be wendy scott @-@ carr &apos;s nanny ?
i do .
it &apos;s kind of odd how this is working ,
me being helped by your firm .
yes , it is odd .
did eli gold ask you to do this ?
no . diane did .
so why don &apos;t you give me a call
when you get all your documentation together ?
am i being used here ?
i don &apos;t know , but you know what the best thing to do if you are ?
what ?
use them right back .
hi , cary .
um , can you call me straight back ? thanks .
why do you want to know ?
why do i want to know if you &apos;re the last one to interview blake ?
i don &apos;t know . i just , uh ,
didn &apos;t see any interview notes .
right , &apos; cause i have them here .
you were out that day , so i talked to him .
okay . anything i should know ?
i don &apos;t know .
who asked you to ask ?
do we have a problem here ?
i didn &apos;t think so . i &apos;m just wondering
why you &apos;re asking me about a dead case .
okay . i &apos;m out the door .
you see this is the door , me and me going .
sorry , man .
it &apos;s a tense place around here these days .
yeah , baghdad after saddam .
the point is to survive .
it was a lark .
it was our guns n &apos; roses moment .
a very lucrative lark .
yeah , well , all the best tracks are , aren &apos;t they ?
it &apos;s just a goof .
kind of the new millennium art .
you know ? collage .
yeah . collage from a killer .
yeah , well , art is art , isn &apos;t it ?
didn &apos;t norman mailer kill somebody or something ?
so how did you get the song ?
where are you from , darling ?
nearby . how did you get the song ?
from him . the killer .
what &apos;s his name ? jarvis ?
jarvis bowes .
yeah , he sent it about a year ago from his mental hospital .
love getting submissions from mental hospitals .
always open them first .
so what is your accent ?
so , he sent you the lyrics ?
no , a tape . god @-@ awful stuff .
sounded like a dying porpoise .
then when i said i wanted to record it ,
he said he wanted to change some lyrics .
guy &apos;s in a mental hospital .
suddenly he thinks he &apos;s ray davies .
so , you &apos;re gonna stay for the set ?
can i see the tape ?
drive on out ,
where no one can see
you drive on out ,
under the christmas tree ...
christmas tree . that &apos;s not in the newer version .
popcorn smell
that won &apos;t come off
the bloody cow guard ...
popcorn ? bloody cow guard ?
i would call that more than generic .
where you going ?
the scene ... see if anything else in the song connects to it .
hello ? hello .
hello ? hello !
phone your sister .
she &apos;s just gonna say , go with the public defender .
then maybe we should go with the public defender .
just give me one minute , okay , dad ?
hi . this is natalie flores
for diane lockhart .
when will she be in ?
it &apos;s very important .
no . it has to be today .
okay . thanks .
well , considering
wendy scott @-@ carr has outspent us by almost two to one ,
i &apos;d say , uh , we were the underdog .
i &apos;m sorry , i have to take another call .
i &apos;ll call you back .
hello . hi , this is eli .
it &apos;s me .
yes , i know . how are you ?
you asked lockhart / gardner to help me ?
what ?
eli , you were the one
who asked lockhart / gardner to help me .
yes , but it &apos;s not what you think .
eli , i need you to call them .
my father has been arrested and they won &apos;t return my calls .
my dad is going to be processed in an hour .
which means that his name
is going to be in the system as undocumented .
eli , how are you ?
no .
i didn &apos;t get the message .
well , actually , can that wait ?
i &apos;m a little bogged down .
no , it can &apos;t wait . i &apos;m sorry .
diane , you asked me last week
if i was happy at lockhart / gardner .
i am , but i don &apos;t want to be unhappy .
she needs your help now .
i &apos;m on my way .
drive on out ,
where no one can see
you drive on out ,
under the christmas tree ...
then what happened ?
we receive a call from the burglary with forcible entry .
and you saw mr. flores at the scene ?
in the vicinity .
there was a report of a hispanic burglar
with a weapon , driving away .
then i saw mr. luis flores driving a similar automobile .
a similar make and model ?
we &apos;re just holding him for questioning , ma &apos;am .
yes , unfortunately , in a few minutes , dispatch will be
sending his name on to
i.c.e. as undocumented .
well , that &apos;s not under my purview .
i &apos;m investigating a burglary .
it was a different make and model , wasn &apos;t it ?
ma &apos;am , you can leave my desk now .
you saw a hispanic man driving his car
near the burglary scene and you took him in for questioning .
talk to the judge , because i &apos;m not talking to you anymore .
he is innocent of the burglary , but he will be deported
if you keep holding on to him .
are you all right ?
yes .
you can go now , if you want .
no , i &apos;m fine .
whatever this is doing for you , mr. gold ,
whatever guilt this is satisfying ,
you don &apos;t have to worry , i &apos;m fine .
do you see this , ma &apos;am ?
this key ?
mr. flores is now in the system .
have a good day .
yep , one court after another ... that &apos;s my life .
you just behave and everything will be all right .
you &apos;re an artist now .
babette penn .
will gardner .
i like your suit .
i like yours .
how is it representing a killer ?
you &apos;re not going to be a killjoy , are you ?
i might . i &apos;m not sure yet .
he &apos;s really nice when you get to know him .
the psycho wants you .
what do you think ?
i think you should go .
hi .
i &apos;m a fan .
of ?
you .
from way back .
the news conference , standing by your man .
i wrote a song about it .
how gratifying .
i &apos;ll send it to you .
oh , goody .
let &apos;s not make this boring , shall we ?
what do you suggest ? tequila shots ?
you &apos;re funny .
no , i &apos;m punting on the first amendment .
really ?
what &apos;s the fun in a constitutional argument ?
you want a quick verdict ?
yeah .
you can bankrupt my client with appeal after appeal ,
and my client &apos;s song has nothing to do with his past crime .
well , good luck with that .
just a warning ...
i play dirty .
you know , when i said
we &apos;ll never use what you guys are going after ...
change of plans .
based on this , your honor ,
we ask for a summary judgment of mr. gardner &apos;s suit .
则可由法官作出即刻的判决或裁决
just a quick correction for ms. penn , your honor .
this suit is not mine .
it is miss cerone &apos;s , whose mother was raped and murdered .
yes , and unfortunately for mr. gardner ,
that case was adjudicated over 30 years ago .
and we are now in civil court .
where you are not objecting on first amendment grounds .
because , in the interest of a quick and tidy summary judgment ,
we would argue this suit should be dismissed on the facts .
which , we would argue , should be heard by a jury .
because you want to inflame the jury &apos;s passions against my client .
no , your honor , because the facts are persuasive .
as you can see
from these revised lyrics , your honor ,
mr. bowes changed the words in his song
to avoid similarities to his crime .
and those changed lyrics mention an imbedded cow guard ,
which you can see in this photo from the crime scene .
really ?
do you have a minute ?
i need to talk to you .
a cow guard ? that &apos;s the connection
mr. gardner is making between my client &apos;s song ...
the lyrics also make reference to christmas trees , your honor .
and , as you can see , from this map and photo ,
within a quarter mile of the crime scene
is the grayton family christmas farm .
now , your honor , we would argue
that ms. penn &apos;s motion be dismissed
and we continue to trial .
ms. penn , do you have anything ?
your honor , yes , we do .
the grayton christmas tree farm was not in existence 30 years ago .
is this true , mr. gardner ?
your honor , we would request a recess to study this .
i checked around on who last interviewed blake .
and there were no interview notes ,
so i thought there was no interview .
but it turns out there was .
matan brody interviewed him last .
and what did he say ?
matan ?
yeah .
he said he interviewed blake last ,
and he was keeping the interview notes under lock and key .
why ?
i don &apos;t know . he wouldn &apos;t say .
did he tell you what was in the interview ?
no .
did you tell matan i was the one asking ?
no .
why ?
cary , will you do me a favor ?
if you find out anything else ,
will you just come talk to me ? no one else .
i talked to alicia because she was your lawyer .
i know .
don &apos;t worry ,
you &apos;re not gonna get subpoenaed again .
childs won &apos;t come after you again .
thanks .
they &apos;re right .
the christmas tree farm is only 18 years old .
okay , we all need to do a bit of musical archeology here .
what is the connection between these lyrics and the crime scene ?
and why did he change those lyrics especially ?
kalinda , where are you on this ?
nowhere .
great . well , let &apos;s get somewhere .
alicia , call for you .
thank you .
hello .
alicia florrick ?
uh , yes . who &apos;s this ?
you know who this is .
i can tell from your voice you know who this is .
is this mr. bowes ?
yes . i need a lawyer .
mr. bowes , you have a lawyer .
and we can &apos;t be speaking .
i need another lawyer .
there &apos;s a web site that is dedicated
to illegally downloading my music .
you can be speaking if he waives his rights .
and you want another lawyer to battle illegal downloads ?
you &apos;re gonna lose tomorrow ; the case will be dismissed ;
and then i &apos;ll need someone to sue over illegal downloads .
well , i need to remind you that i work for the firm representing
the adverse party in your current dispute ,
and i can &apos;t talk to you
unless you &apos;ve talked to your current lawyer .
i already did . she was great .
why do you stay with your husband ?
i don &apos;t know .
why did you change your lyrics ?
i &apos;m an artist .
you know , they did spectrograph studies of fra angelico paintings ,
and they found rough sketches beneath them .
ah , so you were revising to improve ?
i was revising because my life is a revision .
and the christmas tree , that was just an improvement ?
well , it wasn &apos;t the best rhyme , was it ?
i guess i shouldn &apos;t talk art with a lawyer .
it &apos;s up to you .
art is about personalizing , isn &apos;t it ?
lawyers think in terms of the macro , artists the micro .
i see . and what &apos;s the micro here ?
ooh . is this important for our lawsuit ?
our lawsuit against illegal downloads ?
you decide .
i want to remake my life ...
like you have .
how do i do that ?
well , it would have helped if you hadn &apos;t killed someone .
oops !
i can &apos;t change the past , can i ?
once a bad person , always a bad person .
good @-@ bye .
what do you think ?
i think we should be looking to the personal .
i don &apos;t know .
there are new lyrics ,
but none of them seem to connect with the crime scene .
we were wondering
if they might connect to your mom .
i don &apos;t think so .
nothing with the christmas tree , popcorn , cow guard ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . it was february .
we didn &apos;t have a tree up .
and i don &apos;t know what the rest of it means .
this is how it &apos;ll work .
your father was swept up in a hunt @-@ and @-@ peck ;
a burglary charge targeting
a hispanic adult , five @-@ foot ten .
there &apos;ll be a bond hearing tomorrow ,
and he &apos;s sure to be released .
the only problem is he &apos;s in the system now .
immigration has been told of his identity ,
and he &apos;s scheduled to be picked up
along with the other undocumented at 3 : 00 p.m.
so i need to approach a judge
about accelerating his bond hearing .
okay . what can i do ?
be at court tomorrow .
rhonda , hi .
alicia , hi .
i just realized i can help .
i was in the elevator , and i just realized ...
what ?
i &apos;m in a group .
a survivor &apos;s group . we meet every month .
children whose parents have been murdered .
there &apos;s a woman there : lynn boyle .
her mother was raped and murdered
in 1981 in poplar grove .
they never found the killer .
are you all right ?
yes .
actually , for the first time in a long time , i am .
listen , the things you said in the song ,
they don &apos;t sound like my mom .
they sound like hers .
we always said we &apos;d never talk about this .
you think i want to talk about it ?
then why are we talking about it ?
matan brody knows .
what &apos;re you talking about ? no one knows .
there was another investigator at lockhart / gardner .
he seemed to have found out , and he told matan .
does alicia know ?
no .
it was one night .
there &apos;s no way he could have found out .
you know matan . you hired him .
that &apos;s why i think he &apos;s not telling childs .
childs is a lame duck .
you &apos;re saying matan &apos;s wants to see who wins the election ?
my guess is he wants to be kept on , if you win .
okay .
i &apos;ll talk to him .
kalinda ...
you know that i love alicia .
i &apos;ve fallen in love with my wife again .
it would .. kill her to know this .
i know .
it was another murder .
what ?
rhonda told me yesterday .
the lyrics in the song started to make sense to her ,
but not about her mom . why was your phone off ?
what &apos;re you talking about ?
i tried your cell .
no , no , i mean the song .
oh . rhonda is in a survivor group
with the daughter of a woman
named lynn boyle .
she was raped and murdered in poplar grove .
she was kidnapped from her workplace ... a movie theatre .
the popcorn smell ?
lynn boyle , 28 years old , mother of two .
she was found in the trunk of her car .
she was carjacked and forced to drive off into a field ,
where she was raped and murdered .
no dna evidence .
some fabric fibers , but they never matched .
when did this happen ?
um ... three months before malory cerone .
did anyone ever try to connect it to bowes before ?
yeah , but it never stuck .
there was nothing of his at the scene .
kalinda .
the christmas tree .
we &apos;re cutting it close . we have 25 minutes .
we have to get the paperwork to the holding cell , too .
oh , there he is .
he &apos;s here on another case .
counselor , do we really have to belabor the situation ?
take the two weeks , please ?
thank you . next case .
your honor , we have a quick bond matter
that is time sensitive .
i &apos;m sorry . is this hank christie ?
no , your honor , but if you would allow us a moment ,
i have another case in civil court .
well , that &apos;s not up to me , ms ...
lockhart .
ms. lockhart .
emily &apos;s list , is that right ?
it is , your honor . hello .
i had reason to believe he was connected to the crime ,
so i pulled him over .
yeah , but the report stated
that the burglar was between the ages of 18 and 25,
isn &apos;t that correct ?
yes .
and how old is mr. flores ?
well , he says he &apos;s 52 .
officer , i understand the need to widen the net ,
but that would seem awfully wide , wouldn &apos;t it ?
motion for bond approved .
thank you , your honor .
and if we could process this with some haste .
法官签字
i have a release notice for luis flores .
dad !
natalia .
that &apos;s my client . he made bond , sir .
he &apos;s being transferred to i.c.e.
no , the judge just ordered his release . this is a mistake .
that may be , ma &apos;am , but it &apos;s not our mistake .
no , sir , please .
my father &apos;s done nothing wrong .
he &apos;s never even had a parking ticket ... please .
it &apos;s not about doing wrong , miss .
he &apos;s in the system . it &apos;s out of my hands .
it &apos;s not out of your hands . you know it &apos;s not .
that &apos;s just not true , ma &apos;am .
dad .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t say that .
i &apos;m okay .
hey . tom .
what &apos;s up ?
mr. gold , how are you ?
good . good .
haven &apos;t seen you at the sheriff &apos;s association in a while .
uh , the wife hates those things .
yeah , the rubber chickens .
so , um , can you help me out here ?
luis is my gardener .
ah , i don &apos;t know , mr. gold .
it &apos;s i.c.e.
it &apos;s i.c.e. when he &apos;s out the door .
he could be a material witness in an ongoing investigation .
he could be a material witness in an ongoing investigation .
it &apos;s a small gesture .
it would be appreciated .
you can &apos;t find good gardeners these days , you know ?
let me see what i can do .
i &apos;m okay , mijita .
i &apos;m okay .
i think we were almost out of favors in there .
so the lyrics have nothing to do with your crime ?
that is correct .
i &apos;m a fan of elvis costello and gerard manley hopkins ,
and i just wanted to try something
that combined their spirits .
really ?
really . did you like the song ?
i think i liked the earlier version .
i hate my first drafts .
everything &apos;s in flux , don &apos;t you think ?
hmm . and so the christmas tree you mention in the song ...
the lyrics you tried to cover up ...
objection .
actually , i &apos;m not sure
if i should object to that or just laugh .
you want some help with that ?
no , i think i &apos;ve decided .
you two want us all to leave ?
no , your honor .
so the reason you changed the cow guard in your song
has nothing to do with the location of the murder ?
that &apos;s correct .
but you do remember seeing the cow guard ?
i don &apos;t think i do remember , but , uh ,
i &apos;m an intuitive person ,
so it &apos;s probably in there someplace .
and the allusion to forcing a victim to pull over beside a field ...
why did you change those lyrics ?
i thought it was melodramatic .
and yet , fairly realistic given how you killed her .
i &apos;ve tried to block those memories .
so you don &apos;t remember how you killed her .
so the song could be based on your crime ?
objection . leading question .
overruled .
no .
i remember my crime enough
to know that it &apos;s not connected to the song .
good . so the allusion to the car trunk ...
how was that different from the crime ?
well , the song describes how i carried her in the trunk ,
which is impossible .
i couldn &apos;t have done that because i don &apos;t drive a stick .
so you only put her in the trunk after you killed her ?
yes , i ...
go on . you were saying .
your honor , could we take a short recess ?
you were saying about the trunk .
how you put her in the trunk ?
i didn &apos;t do that .
because that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with this crime .
your honor , please , a recess ?
ten minutes .
it &apos;s too bad .
you mixed up the victims .
leaving many observers wondering
whether this new deal will push the congressman &apos;s wife
even closer to divorce .
the deal for her memoirs is estimated
at one point three million dollars .
i say again ... america sucks .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
capitalism at work .
what is it with you youth today
and your disgust for everything capitalistic ?
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s disgusting ?
she &apos;s selling her pain ...
to pay her bills .
it &apos;s better than selling her body .
actually , i disagree .
selling her body is at least more honest .
oh , how i love these little chats .
so ... i told mom about your little girlfriend .
thanks .
she called it your campaign palette cleanser .
you always find some crush
in the last month of the campaign to fixate on .
how i love your mom &apos;s little pop psychology one @-@ liners .
she said it &apos;s &apos; cause you hate yourself .
there we go .
you need to act as savior to someone ,
or you &apos;ll have to face the fact you do bad things .
that doesn &apos;t even make sense .
in a sort of screwed @-@ up way , it does .
why are we even talking about this again ?
can &apos;t we just sit and enjoy quality time ?
she was outside .
what ?
you asked why i &apos;m talking about her again .
because i saw her outside ,
and we said hi .
go to her , dad .
go save her .
uh , hello ?
hi .
i just wanted to say thank you .
that &apos;s all .
you didn &apos;t need to .
my boyfriend &apos;s back from las vegas .
i &apos;m just saying that . it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s not a big deal . i &apos;m just saying it .
i &apos;m glad .
no , no , you don &apos;t have to ...
it &apos;s not what you think . i ...
really . this is just a thank you .
natalie , i know .
i know .
it &apos;s just nice to talk , that &apos;s all .
i &apos;m too old to have expectations of anything other than talk .
oh , my god , that sounded terrible .
no . it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s really nice talking to you .
and to you .
goodbye .
defendant &apos;s motion to dismiss is granted .
it was always a long shot .
i know .
i &apos;m so sorry , ma &apos;am .
that &apos;s okay , buddy .
if there was any way i could get her back ...
them back .
if there was any way ,
i would .
i know you just must hate me .
i hope we can talk sometime .
we have to talk about those illegal downloads .
sure , when you get out .
well , haven &apos;t you heard ?
i am out .
yeah , i have heard .
mr. bowes , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of lynn boyle .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can
and will be used against youin a court of law .
you have the right to an attorney .
if you cannot afford an attorney ...
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s okay .
you guys just play , and i &apos;ll cook .
mom , it &apos;s tied .
carl , what &apos;s wrong with you ? !
well , i kill people , and i eat their hands .
that &apos;s two things .
you have to at least make references i understand .
carl !
dinner is ready !
mom , it &apos;s still tied . where &apos;s dad ?
dad , dinner !
no . i just want to make sure .
i &apos;m coming !
listen , matan , we &apos;ve always worked well together ,
so , you be good to me ,
and i &apos;ll be good to you .
okay .
beat wendy .
i thought you liked it .
i thought you liked public school .
i do . i &apos;d stay there .
i just kind of want to see
what other schools are out there , you know ?
where would we move to ?
i don &apos;t know that we would .
i mean , if we did , maybe just to a bigger apartment .
not back to highland park ?
mom doesn &apos;t want to .
i didn &apos;t say that . it &apos;s expensive .
isn &apos;t the market down ?
what , are you following real estate now ?
hey , dad .
mom was saying that we might just stay around here ,
and not go back to highland park .
that &apos;s right .
everything good ?
as good as it can be .
want some pizza ?
i do .
