ballard ?
i thought it was skidmore .
how many schools did you get into ?
there is no rule that says you have to go to college .
that belongs to mona .
i know . we were just looking at it .
give me the book . you can &apos;t take everything apart
like you want her to disappear .
i don &apos;t ... regret being with you , ezra , at all .
maybe not now , but if we stay together--
what are you saying ?
if you take this time for yourself ,
there will be no regrets .
to be alone , to be lonely ,
i know what that &apos;s like .
ashley , will you marry me ?
did you tell him about jason ?
it would just cause him unnecessary pain .
this whole town is strung together with whispers .
somebody else has been helping ali .
or somebody we &apos;d never suspect .
ali &apos;s dangerous , mike .
even in a cage , she &apos;s really dangerous .
don &apos;t ever go back there again .
nobody &apos;s giving me orders anymore .
where &apos;s your sticker ?
oh , remember my summer trip to haiti ?
turns out i can &apos;t give blood for another year .
what ?
no blood . no cookie .
i didn &apos;t make the rules .
you &apos;re just too lazy to get one .
are you done studying ?
i &apos;ll never be done studying for this test .
i just need the numbers to stop spinning .
hey , and the next time we offer to help your mom ,
can it please not involve needles ?
how &apos;s it going over here ?
great .
i &apos;m so glad you all came to the drive .
i recruited a bunch of people from the church
and they canceled on me at the last minute .
we &apos;re happy to help .
brownie ?
someone from the church actually showed up .
i &apos;m gonna go say hello .
seriously ?
paula .
thank you so much for coming .
i &apos;ll just have you sign in here
and a nurse will call your name .
unfortunately , i &apos;m not gonna be able
to give blood this morning
on account of this little tickle in my throat .
but it &apos;s so nice to see you out and about .
we &apos;ve missed you at the church these last few weeks .
the pastor looks particularly distracted .
everything okay ?
of course .
things have just been , you know , busy .
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s what &apos;s kept the others this morning .
we &apos;re all so busy these days .
i &apos;m gonna check on the other donors .
see if they need anything .
just one quick thing before you go .
could you ask the pastor
about putting these up around the church ?
of course .
thank you .
young man , this is a restricted zone .
what are you doing back here ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i was just interested in how it all works .
then go sign up and see for yourself .
yeah . okay .
mike !
okay , what was that about ?
was mike just here to steal cookies or something else ?
第五季第十九集
you ask mike why he was at the blood drive .
i already know his answer .
that he was there to donate ?
no .
that i should mind my own business .
and i got that message loud and clear at the dock .
okay , but it is our business .
we all saw where he was standing , right ?
by the coolers where they keep the blood .
our blood .
really , spencer ?
well , if he &apos;s trying to get his hands
on something that could help alison--
so that &apos;s it ? he &apos;s guilty ?
god , the court of public opinion in this town really sucks .
everyone just take a breath , okay ?
well , it &apos;s hard to breathe when someone &apos;s trying
to set you up as an accessory to murder .
look , we still don &apos;t know why he was visiting ali in jail
or why he fought with mona .
if they had a serious falling out--
just stop . please .
look , i know you &apos;re all desperate to
find out who &apos;s helping alison .
but just because it isn &apos;t holbrook ,
does not mean that it &apos;s my brother .
okay , mike was in love with mona
and he would never hurt her .
and he would never team up with someone who did .
aria .
no . i can &apos;t talk about this right now .
i have a math test .
艾瑞亚 · 蒙哥马利
spencer ?
yeah .
i have a question .
it &apos;s college related .
okay .
and i know that &apos;s a touchy subject
because i got into all these schools and you ...
okay , hanna ,
what &apos;s your question ?
no one &apos;s offering me financial aid .
some of these schools , they &apos;re like $ 45,000 a year .
my mom can &apos;t afford that .
she doesn &apos;t even have a job right now .
wait , i thought she was working for ali &apos;s family ?
well , she was , but she left .
but i thought after jason came back to work ...
yeah , he did and she left .
okay , well , financial aid is based on your parents &apos; income .
they don &apos;t think that your mom can pay ,
but they think that your dad can .
aria . hey .
aria .
hey , andrew . what &apos;s up ?
what &apos;s up is i saw you reading my answers ,
copying them down .
my god , i &apos;m so sorry .
look , i couldn &apos;t focus in there at all . i froze .
i got a conditional admission
into savannah college of art and design ,
and if i don &apos;t make honor roll this semester ,
they could completely withdraw my acceptance .
i ... i &apos;m so sorry .
i just ... i panicked , and i ...
slow down , okay ? i &apos;m not mad .
you &apos;re not ?
no . but if you need a tutor--
i don &apos;t . i ...
i don &apos;t . there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s just a lot going on right now and i ...
well , if you &apos;d rather get caught cheating .
wait .
how &apos;s tomorrow ?
i haven &apos;t done this in years .
having fun ?
yes .
you were right .
riding downhill , standing on your pedals .
it &apos;s the closest thing you can get to flying .
okay .
here .
come on .
it &apos;s this way .
here ?
here .
this is where you had your first kiss ?
marvin biglioni .
the summer after fourth grade .
he looked like a frog .
his cheeks were out to here .
so you were trying to turn him into a prince ?
a girl can dream .
so we were standing right here
and he leans in ,
and right as we &apos;re about to seal the deal
on my first kiss ever ,
he burps .
and it &apos;s wet .
that &apos;s gross .
and all i could think was , &quot; do @-@ over .
i just want a do @-@ over . &quot;
it was awful .
yeah .
okay , your turn .
tell me something .
my first kiss ?
i don &apos;t know if we can bike there from here .
no .
tell me your biggest fear .
okay , you know what , stupid question .
no . no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s just ...
too soon ?
i get that .
i mean , there are things
i &apos;m not ready to talk about either .
what was that for ?
do @-@ over .
mom , are you okay ?
i talked to him .
ted .
i stopped by the church after the blood drive .
he deserved an answer .
what did you say ?
i said yes .
i said i wanted to marry him .
and then i told him about what happened when he was away .
you did ?
what did he say ?
he said he needed to think .
he said he would call me in a couple of hours .
he couldn &apos;t even look at me , hanna .
i &apos;m gonna make us some dinner .
is there stuff for a salad ?
yeah , and you thought melissa was &quot; a. &quot;
and you were wrong about that . remember ?
i know . but ...
look , i promise to keep an eye on mike
if you promise not to jump to conclusions .
fine . deal .
okay .
so what are you and toby doing tonight ?
we &apos;re not . something came up .
what about you and ezra ?
got any friday night plans ?
no . no .
i &apos;m staying in to prepare for a study session with andrew .
andrew campbell ?
be careful there .
why ?
the dimples , mostly .
okay . i should get back to it .
talk later ?
later .
hello .
hi .
this part of the rental agreement ?
you get to raid our fridge ?
thought you had plans with toby .
well , something came up .
duty calls .
cop stuff .
yeah , that &apos;s the technical term for it .
i &apos;m painting a mural at hollis tonight .
that &apos;s like a huge get .
it is .
and i could use my illustrious assistant
if you &apos;re available .
i don &apos;t know , my mom really wants me
to email a bunch of these family contacts .
back on the college track ?
yeah .
apparently , the hastings are very well connected .
and i have a third cousin
twice removed who works at colby college .
i promise you a real dinner if you come .
hello .
this is a call
from the chester women &apos;s correctional facility .
you have a call from inmate hank mahoney .
press one to accept this call .
alison ?
alison !
do you usually paint in the dark
well , it &apos;s easier this way .
i don &apos;t bother the students , faculty .
they don &apos;t bother me .
can you help me with this ?
this ?
yeah .
where do you want it ?
just get it up first .
okay .
that way a little bit .
okay .
perfect .
so what were you gonna do if i said no ?
probably call sophia .
my girlfriend . ex @-@ girlfriend .
we just broke up .
sorry .
don &apos;t be . it &apos;s a good thing .
i tend to fall for women who are unavailable .
emotionally or otherwise .
but you were just gonna call her anyways ?
i mean , wouldn &apos;t that make her think
that you were still interested ?
yes .
probably .
did i mention how bad i am at relationships ?
i &apos;ve never been to this side of campus .
there &apos;s nothing over here but a bunch of old research labs .
i &apos;m here to revitalize the place .
i used to come to hollis a lot when i was a kid .
my parents would take melissa and me
to this summer concert series .
back when i thought i was gonna be a famous violinist .
what happened ?
i &apos;m more of an appreciator of the arts .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
it means , in the hastings family ,
if you don &apos;t excel at something , you just ,
you move on to the next thing .
so you &apos;ve never just done something because you love it ?
well , how can you love something if you &apos;re bad at it ?
i usually manage .
mike !
mike , i know you &apos;re in there .
what do you want ?
why is alison calling you ?
what ?
first you visit her ,
and now she &apos;s sending you secret messages from jail ?
who the hell is hank mahoney ?
i have no idea .
and next time don &apos;t answer my phone .
why are you letting her manipulate you like this ?
you know what ali &apos;s capable of .
mike , i know that you got in a fight with mona
the night before she died .
something is going on
and you have to tell me what it is .
i don &apos;t have to tell you anything .
no one wants to believe that mike is helping ali .
but if ali could take down holbrook ,
a grown @-@ ass man with a police badge ,
who knows what she could do to aria &apos;s brother .
hanna--
caleb , i have to go .
your father left a voicemail about lunch tomorrow .
he said he &apos;s at the office all day ,
and you &apos;ll have to catch up another time .
there anything in particular you need to catch up on ?
i was gonna bring this up earlier .
bring up what ?
i found out why none of the schools
i got into are offering me financial aid .
apparently , dad had a really good year last year .
and i just wanted to talk to him and ask him if ...
hanna ,
your dad &apos;s financial obligation was worked out
in the divorce settlement years ago .
well , it &apos;s not enough .
mom , i just want to talk to him and ...
and what ? explain that i don &apos;t have a job anymore , and ...
i would rather not share that story with anyone else ,
thank you .
if he &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not getting help
then he should take on the extra expense .
he has the money .
listen to me .
going to your father is not gonna fix this .
i will figure this out .
understood ?
paperwork on a friday ?
yeah .
just trying to stay ahead of the game .
turns out i don &apos;t get weekends off anymore .
or summers .
hey , did talia leave already ?
yeah .
yeah , i was just saying goodbye .
you two seem to be getting along
a whole lot better these days .
can you believe that aria might be in savannah next year ?
we could have our very own southern belle .
aria got into scad ?
yeah , i thought you knew .
she was really excited .
i &apos;ll let you get back to work .
isn &apos;t talia &apos;s last name sandoval ?
why does that say mendoza on her file ?
maybe mendoza &apos;s her married name .
lot of people use their maiden name professionally .
yeah . talia is not married .
yes , she is .
she has her husband listed under her emergency contact .
this is really great .
but who &apos;s gonna see this ?
those people . up there .
the higher @-@ ups .
catch .
what ?
throwing things at people on ladders ?
not cool .
i told you i &apos;m not an artist .
we &apos;re not leaving until you paint something .
anything .
i could ruin it .
that &apos;s a risk i &apos;m willing to take .
okay .
look good .
you cannot even see it from down there .
okay .
picasso , come take a look .
all right .
and let &apos;s see the damage .
i &apos;ll clean up down here .
明天我会带过去 几点 迈克 · m
霍里斯大学故意毁坏公物事件
what is this ?
you &apos;re smiling about this ?
you don &apos;t get to smile about this .
you told me that you were hired to paint a mural at hollis .
i did not say &quot; hired . &quot; i was careful about that .
you know what else you didn &apos;t say ? &quot; vandalism . &quot;
if i told you the truth , would you have come ?
no ! of course not !
look , i am all for protest art ,
but i &apos;m not for getting tricked into doing something illegal .
spencer , hold on .
hold on .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
okay .
i @-@ i wanted you to come .
all this college talk with your mom ,
i thought maybe you &apos;d enjoy coloring outside the lines for once .
for once ?
i was arrested , jonny .
for murder .
and they dropped the charges ,
but i cannot mess up again , okay ?
i can &apos;t be arrested again .
i didn &apos;t know .
okay . well , now you do .
what &apos;s next ?
vectors and equilibrium , or the french and indian war ?
aria ?
oh . sorry .
i &apos;m a little out of it . i didn &apos;t get much sleep last night .
is anything wrong ?
no . no , i &apos;m fine .
guess i should choose what i &apos;m worst at , right ?
i take it math and science aren &apos;t fitz &apos;s strong suit .
excuse me ?
i mean , you could always ask him for help , right ?
assuming you &apos;re still together .
let &apos;s , um , let &apos;s just stick to the books .
okay , so there are two types of physical quantity .
they are--
vector and scalar . that &apos;s correct .
sorry .
which is your phone ?
scalar ?
and if your phone were to sail through the sky ,
accelerating at a rate of 3 miles per hour per second ?
vector .
你和迈克聊过没 汉娜
looks like someone &apos;s worried about your brother .
come here .
i have another table to bus .
you have to try this .
i &apos;m really not hungry .
oh , come on . there &apos;s always room for dessert .
come on , try it .
no . i &apos;m good .
emily . hey .
are you okay ? what &apos;s wrong ?
you &apos;re married , talia . that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
i saw your last name , mendoza ,
and it &apos;s the same as your husband &apos;s .
were you ever gonna tell me ?
yes .
when ?
i don &apos;t understand .
emily--
i don &apos;t understand how you can stand there all this time
and not tell me this .
how you can kiss me , how you can tell me you like me
and not tell me any of this .
emily--
is everything okay in here ?
i &apos;ll talk to mae . she &apos;ll set it up .
great seeing you , alan .
hey , dad .
we good on time ?
i &apos;ve got about an hour till batting practice .
want to move on to spanish ?
hmm . baseball team , spanish group , decathlon--
are there any school activities you are not involved in ?
well , compared to your exciting life ,
mine must seem really--
functional ? healthy ?
planned .
one sec .
i need to talk to you about mike .
hey , andrew .
hi , emily .
okay .
where did mike get $ 18,000 ?
doesn &apos;t &quot; a &quot; always have access to a ton of money ?
maybe this is one of ali &apos;s secret accounts .
mike got a call last night
from the women &apos;s correctional facility .
from ali ?
i think so .
she called , said her name was hank mahoney and hung up .
i mean , it &apos;s got to be some kind of code .
and now he &apos;s got $ 400 burning a hole in his pocket .
mike just took the car .
we need to follow him .
how ?
i am not riding on your handlebars .
hey , andrew .
can we borrow your car ?
just for a little bit .
do either of you drive a stick ?
ballard , skidmore , and trinity ?
not bad , right ?
not bad at all .
you know which one you want to go to ?
not yet .
i still have to figure out how i &apos;m gonna pay for it .
that &apos;s sort of what i wanted to talk to you about .
your mom and i have an agreement in place .
if she &apos;s got an issue--
well , she doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;m the one asking .
hanna , i &apos;m so proud of you .
i really am .
but i didn &apos;t even know that you wanted
to go to these types of schools .
this is-- this kind of thing takes planning .
so what are you saying ?
i &apos;m saying , $ 10,000 a year .
that &apos;s what your mom and i agreed on .
kate starts dartmouth in the fall
and i cannot afford to put two kids through private school .
hanna , it comes down to dollars and cents ,
and i just don &apos;t have it .
you &apos;re paying for kate ?
hanna , kate worked hard for this .
she got early acceptance ,
and i have already promised isabel
that i will take care of it .
so kate is going to dartmouth , and you &apos;re paying ,
and you didn &apos;t even ask me where i applied .
last we talked about college ,
you said you &apos;d rather spend the money on a beach vacation
and a good manicure .
last we talked about college ,
i was 12 years old and obsessed with donuts .
you &apos;d never even heard of kate .
hanna , i want to help , i just ...
you just ... you don &apos;t want to disappoint the wrong daughter .
i get it .
发信人 : 斯宾塞 · 海斯汀
&quot; i owe you much more than an e @-@ mail .
&quot; especially this one .
&quot; i know it &apos;s a long shot ,
but any chance wren still has that contact at oxford ? &quot;
有人在霍利斯学院肆意毁坏
spencer says she &apos;ll meet us there .
left .
he &apos;s turning left .
do you often follow your brother places ?
not usually .
and you have no idea where we &apos;re going ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s close .
what exactly is going on with mike ?
drugs .
drugs ?
you know , like stimulants , amphetamines .
yeah , we think he might be dabbling .
really ?
yep .
okay , well , no word from hanna ,
but spencer &apos;s getting on the highway .
so i &apos;ll just text her when we get ...
get to where we &apos;re going .
thank you so much for the ride .
should i come in with you ?
no , no . we &apos;ve got it from here .
how are you getting home ?
spencer can give us a ride .
yeah .
and if you leave right now ,
you could still make the end of your batting practice .
drugs ? seriously , em ?
i &apos;m mike .
hank .
that &apos;s hank mahoney ?
no . that &apos;s cyrus petrillo .
ali &apos;s fake kidnapper .
hanna ? are you okay ?
where &apos;s emily ?
she left early . what &apos;s going on ?
nothing .
i just left my phone at my dad &apos;s office
and i can &apos;t reach anyone .
and you can &apos;t go back and get it ?
no , i can &apos;t . i cannot go back there .
okay , well , look , you don &apos;t have to tell me anything ,
but ... you can if you want to .
my dad didn &apos;t think that i &apos;m a college material .
he thinks kate is , not me .
and he never thought that i &apos;d go to a good school , and now ,
because of him , i might not get to .
sorry , who is kate ?
my stepsister .
my stupid , perfect stepsister .
you know , i wanted him to help pay for school ,
but you know what i wanted more than that ,
was for him to just look at me once and say ,
&quot; i knew that you had it in you . &quot;
when i was in high school ,
my parents couldn &apos;t agree on a single thing
except for the fact that i wouldn &apos;t amount to much .
and what happened ?
once they cut me off
and i realized that i was on my own ,
i took out a bunch of loans ,
i applied to every job that i could ,
no matter how ridiculous ,
and i paid my way through school by myself .
you know , those guys that stand outside
with the hot dog uniforms in 90 degree heat ?
you were a hot dog ?
oh , yeah .
yeah , i was the best damn hot dog .
i know this isn &apos;t the same .
but i used to be your teacher ,
and i always knew that you had it in you .
i &apos;m so sorry , guys . i got here as fast as i could .
what do we know ? anything ?
we think mike brought cyrus money . $ 400 .
we tried to get close , but they almost saw us .
and that message that ali sent from jail ,
that was her way of telling mike cyrus &apos;s new name ?
yes , so mike could find him .
that &apos;s what we think anyway .
so he &apos;s here on an errand from ali ?
i mean , is it just me , or is she even scarier behind bars ?
look , cyrus , hank , whoever this guy is ,
he &apos;s really dangerous and he &apos;s talking to my brother .
so i @-@ i don &apos;t care if mike is working for ali .
i &apos;m not gonna let him get hurt .
so we should just ...
aria , stop . hey . you cannot do that .
look , i know that you &apos;re really worried about mike ,
but as soon as they leave the diner ,
we &apos;re gonna follow cyrus
and we &apos;ll find out where he &apos;s going and what he knows .
if we go in there , we won &apos;t know any more than we know now .
shut it off . shut it off .
okay .
手机
straight to voicemail .
well , do you want to call somebody else ? i have emily &apos;s number .
no , it &apos;s fine . i &apos;m just gonna head home .
okay .
thank you for the image of you in a hot dog costume .
and everything else that you said .
yeah , anytime .
20000奖学金
i told ezra about savannah .
i thought he knew .
yeah . i should &apos;ve told him already .
why didn &apos;t you ? you guys fighting ?
i don &apos;t know what we are , honestly .
i mean , he thinks he &apos;s the reason
that i didn &apos;t have this perfect high school experience .
is that even a thing ? does anyone have that ?
i don &apos;t know .
god , em , i know you must be missing paige right now ,
but at least your love life isn &apos;t full @-@ on confusing .
&quot; thanks for donating to my get @-@ into @-@ jail fund .
谢谢你们为我的坐牢资金做贡献 a
&quot; a. &quot;
what ?
guys .
the envelope . it wasn &apos;t money .
where &apos;s cyrus ? was he with mike ?
i don &apos;t know .
so you &apos;re here to watch the kid , or me ?
&apos;cause to be honest , i don &apos;t like being followed .
you have something that belongs to us .
do i ?
yeah . we just want it back .
maybe we could work out a trade .
back away from them .
now .
you guys okay ?
you went to see your dad .
did he drop it off ?
i &apos;m sorry i went .
believe me , i am .
and i didn &apos;t mention anything about your job .
let me guess .
he said it all comes down to dollars and cents .
i know your dad can be ... dismissive .
but please tell me you &apos;re not looking for validation
in a beauty pageant .
i &apos;m not .
the winner gets a $ 20,000 scholarship .
we &apos;re gonna have to pay for my tuition somehow .
did ted call ?
no .
and i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going to .
so that &apos;s it ?
hanna--
mom . you love him .
you can &apos;t just give up like that .
it &apos;s not just my decision .
well , he &apos;s hurt , and you have to fight for him .
i &apos;m serious .
if i can put myself in this beauty pageant ,
then you can call the man that you love
and want to spend the rest of your life with
and tell him to take you back .
here , you can even use my phone .
please ?
i &apos;ll be out of your hair in a minute .
um , i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll be right upstairs , okay ?
okay , look ,
i talked to my mom and she informed me
that she would never ever buy frozen mac &apos; n &apos; cheese
or anything that started with the word &quot; zesty . &quot;
so i &apos;m really sorry
that i &apos;ve been eating all of your food .
no worries .
and also , you were right , by the way .
i did have fun last night .
but i also have boundaries .
and getting to go to college is maybe my best chance
of getting out of this town .
so i really don &apos;t want to ruin it .
i get it . i do .
believe it or not , i have boundaries , too .
really ?
at least i &apos;m trying to .
good night .
okay . good night .
eric and i started dating in 9th grade .
we were married right after high school .
we loved each other ,
but we barely even knew ourselves .
we still love each other , but it &apos;s not romantic .
he knows i &apos;m attracted to women .
he knows that i have to be true to myself .
then why stay with him ?
because he &apos;s my best friend .
because he has been with me through everything .
i know this is complicated .
no one wants complicated .
i &apos;m beginning to think that there &apos;s no such thing as simple .
i shouldn &apos;t have lied to you .
i just didn &apos;t want to scare you away .
i know how it all sounds when i say it out loud .
i &apos;m sorry , emily .
i just wanted to tell you that in person .
remember ...
when you asked me what my biggest fear was ?
y @-@ yeah .
there are things i &apos;m not ready to share with you either .
things that would scare you away from me .
that is very hard to believe .
we just filled my overnight bag and ran .
was the car back ?
no . not yet .
thanks .
so glad you &apos;re staying here tonight .
it was bad enough when
mike was stealing jenna &apos;s pottery . now this ?
this is our blood .
well , what do we do now ?
we just wait until &quot; a &quot; paints the town red in our dna ?
i don &apos;t know .
one drop here , one spot there , and kaboom ,
we &apos;re all sharing a jail cell with ali .
you are , like , the queen of not helping .
see ? there &apos;s a reason i &apos;m afraid of needles .
we should &apos;ve all spent the summer in haiti .
i &apos;m gonna go get us another blanket .
what are you gonna do with all the stuff in the bin ?
we &apos;ll burn the clothes and personal items .
and the barrel ?
we &apos;ll roll it into the woods ,
and then we &apos;ll call the police from a burner phone .
we &apos;ll never pull this off .
yes , we will .
i found a drill bit that can break the lock .
and i already rented a van and a dolly .
