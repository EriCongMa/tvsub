we &apos;re in position .
swat is all set . give us the word , commander .
three , two , one .
go ! go ! go !
well , maybe it &apos;s just me ,
but aren &apos;t there supposed to be guns in a gun deal ?
maybe a gun dealer or something like that ?
doesn &apos;t make sense .
this is where the deal was supposed to go down .
looks like you boys got some bad intel .
well , maybe they caught wind we were coming
and changed the menu .
or maybe the time got moved up
and we &apos;re late to the party .
okay . well , we &apos;ll canvass the area
and see if anyone saw anything .
all right . catherine , do me a favor ,
call the atf , all right ?
see if anything &apos;s come up on their radar .
roger that .
thanks for the backup , lou .
you got it .
all right , fellas , let &apos;s pack it up .
maybe they moved up the time ?
what do you want me to say ?
maybe that you were wrong .
that we should have vetted this thing properly
before we wasted everybody &apos;s time .
maybe listening to a convicted felon
is not the right move .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to put words in your mouth though .
you know what i mean ?
let me tell you something .
that son of a bitch-- he &apos;s laughing in his cell right now .
let &apos;s go .
just for the record ,
this is the same thing as admitting you were wrong .
yeah , okay .
you hear that ?
he &apos;s alive , but barely .
what &apos;s your name ?
who did this to you ?
bomb . bomb .
i thought you said we were gonna take things slow .
i &apos;m willing to forget that i said that .
me , too .
morning .
what are you doing , sneaking out on me ?
no , i just thought i &apos;d make us some coffee .
you come and get back in bed .
i &apos;ll go make the coffee .
i think i can manage , jersey .
yeah ?
yeah .
hi .
grace .
what are you doing here ?
you &apos;re supposed to be with your mom .
her flight changed ; she had to leave early .
well , you got to call me .
you got to let me know if something changes .
i tried to last night ; it kept going to voice mail .
um , this is my friend amber .
uh , amber , this is ,
um ... this is my daughter grace .
this is my friend amber .
i &apos;ve heard so much about you .
is that my dad &apos;s shirt ?
my daughter &apos;s been scarred for life ,
and you think it &apos;s funny . that &apos;s great .
what , you don &apos;t think you &apos;re overreacting a little bit ?
no , i don &apos;t .
come on , man .
the amount of time you and amber have been spending together ,
those two were bound to meet sooner or later .
now , you know , well , gracie will never forget .
that &apos;s nice .
look , uh ... the last thing i need
is for grace to get attached to another woman .
okay ? i mean , when gabby took off , it really upset her ,
and i @-@ i don &apos;t want to put her through that again .
uh @-@ huh .
&quot; uh @-@ huh &quot; ?
what is &quot; uh @-@ huh &quot; ? what does that mean ?
nothing .
no @-@ no @-@ no , please .
if you have something to say , just say it .
okay . maybe you should consider ,
this is less about protecting gracie ,
more about protecting yourself .
protecting myself from what ?
from getting into another serious relationship .
she &apos;s ten years younger than me . what am i gonna do ?
danny , if she was the same age as you ,
you would come up with a different excuse ,
whatever you need , because you can &apos;t be happy .
it &apos;s impossible for you ;
it @-@ it &apos;s not in your dna .
well , i don &apos;t know what the hell i was doing
coming here getting relationship advice from you .
what do you know ?
i know people .
no , you know how to kill people . there &apos;s a big difference .
mcgarrett .
yeah . we got to go .
jc dekker .
how &apos;s the surfboard business ?
you tell me .
state of hawaii became the proud owner of that
when you threw me in here .
well , that &apos;s because your problem was trying to diversify .
you should &apos;ve just stuck with
selling surfboards instead of going to the guns .
warden says you got something for us .
i do .
there &apos;s a supplier out of the philippines
bringing in a big shipment .
top of the line semi @-@ autos .
no serials , completely untraceable .
type of product that attracts the , uh ...
worst type of buyer .
okay . when &apos;s this going down ?
an hour from now .
but you want to know where ,
you got to put something on the table for me .
oh , why , the atf stopped returning your calls ?
we heard that you been supplying them intel , as well ,
for time off your sentence .
listen , a month here and there ain &apos;t making a dent .
now , as much as i hate helping five @-@ 0,
you boys got a cozy relationship with the governor .
i figure you can get me some new digs at waiawa .
minimum security , cut my sentence in half .
that &apos;s very ambitious .
now i know why you &apos;re so good selling guns yourself .
i &apos;m a changed man .
i &apos;m just trying to get home to my family .
now , listen , my word &apos;s good on this .
just make sure it doesn &apos;t come back to me .
looks like you two just have to trust me .
danny !
danny !
danny !
danny ?
chin .
chin , are you okay ?
this is captain grover . i got a collapsed building .
address 1085 ahua street .
expedite fire rescue .
i need all available units .
steve !
danny !
danny !
you got to get out of there , catherine , it &apos;s not safe .
they &apos;re down here !
catherine .
danny ! danny !
danny !
steve .
danny !
steve .
danny .
danny .
i got you , buddy .
i &apos;m right here .
i got you .
my leg &apos;s pinned .
i think i broke a rib .
where &apos;s the other guy ? huh ?
he &apos;s dead .
okay , listen to me , this thing &apos;s too heavy .
i can &apos;t lift it .
i got no cell service down here , so i can &apos;t call for help .
okay .
i &apos;m gonna go get something to give me some leverage ,
get this off your leg , okay ?
i &apos;ll be right back .
all right . whoa @-@ whoa @-@ whoa .
don &apos;t go just yet .
danny , relax , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
is it okay ? &apos; cause ...
i &apos;m in a confined space
with a bunch of concrete on top of me ,
and given my present condition ,
that &apos;s not the best situation for me .
you know what i mean ?
right , right , right . claustrophobia .
yeah .
okay .
take a deep breath , okay ?
no , that &apos;s no good .
it makes it worse .
danny , i got to get this off your leg .
you understand me ?
all right , all right , okay .
all right , carter &apos;s behind the plate .
we got santana ...
fernandez . fernandez playing first .
backman &apos;s playing second base .
what are you doing ?
helps me relax . i just recite the &apos; 86 mets lineup .
it helps me relax .
oh , that &apos;s great . that &apos;s good .
i &apos;ll be back , all right ?
okay .
santana &apos;s playing shortstop .
good . sit down .
knight . knight &apos;s on third .
you have any idea where your boys were when this thing came down ?
no idea . last time we saw them was on the bottom floor .
that &apos;s roughly 300 tons of steel and concrete between us and them .
we need to set off water , power and gas .
i think that &apos;s already been done .
we need to get in there and get them out of there .
before i start bringing in heavy equipment
and putting my people at risk ,
i need to determine if this is rescue or recovery .
i understand you have a personal relationship with these guys .
you damn right , hank .
i know these guys . they &apos;re survivors .
and the longer we stand around here waiting around ,
the less chance they have of coming out of there alive .
protocol is : we don &apos;t dig until we &apos;ve located bodies .
the sooner we pinpoint their location ,
the sooner we come up with a game plan , all right ?
do your best .
any update ?
no .
we &apos;re still trying to locate them .
catherine and i have been trying their cells ,
but it goes straight to voice mail .
we were set up .
bonilla &apos;s playing right field .
bret saberhag ... bret ...
bret saberhagen &apos;s on the mound .
where the hell you been ?
i moved on to the &apos; 92 roster .
it &apos;s a tough year .
i found a flashlight . we &apos;re gonna need that .
okay .
you got to get this thing off of me .
oh man .
when i lift this , you feel the weight come off your leg ,
i need you to roll out , slide your leg out , okay ?
but you got to do it quick .
i don &apos;t know how long i can hold this .
that &apos;s very encouraging .
i &apos;m not even sure i can move .
you can move . you can .
you can , all right ?
all right , you ready ?
one , two , three .
oh , that &apos;s no good .
you stay still .
i got to look at this .
come on .
oh , what is that ?
okay , it &apos;s a piece of rebar . it &apos;s missed your vitals ,
but i got to take it out .
the trick &apos;s gonna be to stop the bleeding .
maybe don &apos;t take it out .
maybe we just leave it in for a minute .
leaving it in is not an option .
this gets infected , sepsis sets in , then we got real trouble .
you understand me ? we got to ...
as opposed to our current situation ?
okay , stay still .
i &apos;m gonna be right back .
what are you doing ? what &apos;s that ?
all right , this has got peroxide in it .
i can disinfect this wound .
i &apos;m not gonna lie to you ; this is gonna hurt a lot .
the really bad pain only lasts a couple of seconds .
you got to stay conscious .
i &apos;m right here . all right ?
ready ?
two .
three .
god !
all right , all right .
stay with me , danny .
stay with me . hey , who played left ?
&apos;86 mets , left field-- who was it ?
george foster ,
and he was replaced by mookie wilson after two seasons .
midseason , right ? that &apos;s my boy .
keep the pressure . keep the pressure , danny .
stay with me .
how we looking ?
is it good ?
it &apos;s good . pretty good .
come on .
keep your weight off that leg .
nah , i &apos;m good . let &apos;s get the hell out of here . come on .
no , danny . hold up .
which way ?
we &apos;re not going anywhere , buddy .
place is caved in . we can &apos;t get out of here .
do me a favor , would you , please ?
of course . whatever you need .
look at me in the eye-- look at me--
and admit something to me .
we should not have listened to dekker , hmm ?
you want to do that now ?
it was a lead we had to follow , danny , okay ?
and by the way , you &apos;re welcome for saving your life .
what is that , a souvenir ?
yeah , it &apos;s a souvenir .
rescue team would have arrived already .
they &apos;d be listening in .
find something to bang on , make some noise .
sorry . that was rude .
what were you saying ?
look , man , i &apos;m telling you .
my information was good .
now , if the deal got messy , it &apos;s not on me .
wrong . it &apos;s all on you .
and i want the names of the people who helped you pull this off .
you must have lost some hearing in that explosion .
i was just doing my civic duty
and passing along what i heard .
from who ?
half the prison just saw you haul my ass off the yard .
now , if i give up my source , i &apos;m a dead man .
know what i think ?
i think there never was a source .
i think this is all payback for five @-@ 0 putting you in here .
why would i do that ?
i &apos;m trying to get the hell out of here , not add more years .
we &apos;re gonna find out how you did this .
let me tell you something else .
if they die down there , i &apos;m gonna kill you myself .
someone on the outside had to rig these explosives .
why don &apos;t you pull dekker &apos;s visitor log and phone records .
let &apos;s see who he &apos;s been communicating with since he got here .
chin , dekker &apos;s not going anywhere .
we should be back there trying to find steve and danny .
hey , we got the best people
doing everything they can to rescue them .
our job is to work the case just like any other .
we owe it to them to do that .
i got something !
over here !
all right , hold the work !
hold the work ! everybody , quiet !
everybody stop moving !
it &apos;s them .
they &apos;re alive .
yes . hank ?
all right , the noise seems to be coming from this area .
my engineers are already working on an extraction plan .
all right , how long ?
oh , there &apos;s a lot of guesswork here .
gpr isn &apos;t giving us an image .
without knowing their precise location , it could take hours .
cath , where you going ?
see if we can get a microphone close enough to hear them .
maybe we can get a cellular repeater down there .
this is pointless .
they can &apos;t hear us .
oh , oh !
what ?
can i die in peace , please ?
you &apos;re tired and you &apos;re hurting , just take a break , all right ?
do me a favor , please .
what ?
for once in your life , just pretend you &apos;re a human being ,
and take this situation for what it is .
can you do that for me , please ?
i &apos;m keenly aware of the situation ...
really ? because the human response to certain death
and , uh , the prospect of never seeing the people
you love ever again is curling up into the fetal position
and messing your pants .
okay , what good &apos;s that gonna do you , huh ?
fear is a state of mind , danny , okay ?
you got to fight through it .
oh , i @-@ i disagree .
i think that fear is actually your friend .
it tells you when you &apos;re supposed to avoid a situation .
but you never listen to it .
that is why we are here in the first place .
that would be a compelling argument , my friend ,
if you weren &apos;t afraid of absolutely everything .
this morning , you had a near mental breakdown
because your girlfriend met your kid .
it doesn &apos;t matter what the situation is for you .
you gravitate to the worst possible outcomes .
once again , i &apos;m proven right !
we never should have gone
in this situation blind in the first place !
you all right ?
no , i &apos;m not all right .
listen , all right ?
i &apos;m sorry , okay ? just please relax .
the air is getting thin in here .
we got to conserve this oxygen .
okay .
what ?
maybe it &apos;s , uh , lack of oxygen ,
but something ain &apos;t sitting right with me .
we were dekker &apos;s target , right ?
why this guy ?
why the half @-@ dead guy in the closet ?
the call lured us in here .
for all we know , this guy was bait .
why him ? i mean , you take a guy off the street ,
beat him half to death .
why him , specifically ?
i don &apos;t know . my guess is :
he wasn &apos;t chosen at random , that &apos;s my guess .
he &apos;s got no wallet .
couple pills . i don &apos;t know .
medication , prescription , something .
check his cell phone .
it &apos;s all busted up .
steve .
this guy &apos;s wired .
he &apos;s wearing a camera .
that &apos;s how they knew when to detonate .
that guy had somebody watching .
is that you ?
it &apos;s catherine .
it &apos;s catherine .
catherine .
steve !
thank god . are you guys all right ?
yeah , danny &apos;s a little banged up , but we &apos;re okay .
everybody else get out ?
all accounted for except you two stragglers .
we got the whole cavalry up here working to get you guys out .
great . we got an eta on that ?
i &apos;m literally being held together by duct tape .
yeah , we &apos;re working on it .
we need to know your exact location .
we &apos;re in the maintenance room , south side of the garage .
got it . get over here .
steve , how &apos;s the oxygen ?
it &apos;s running low .
is there anything we can do from this end to speed things up ?
just hang tight .
listen , the entire area is unstable .
you go moving something you &apos;re not supposed to ,
the whole damn thing &apos;ll come crashing down .
ah , that &apos;s encouraging .
steve , what happened ?
you were right behind us .
listen , you think you can establish a video call ?
i want to show you something .
it &apos;s not as bad as it looks .
thanks for trying to make me feel better .
you say you wanted to show us something .
yeah , take a look at this .
cath , can you capture that ?
got it . i &apos;ll run these photos
through the database and see if i can get an i.d.
look for any connection to jc dekker and his crew , all right ?
i want to know how this guy got down here .
roger that .
those pills you found
on your victim are warfarin-- 500 milligrams .
it is an anticoagulant commonly used
to treat patients with heart conditions .
well , how common is it , max ?
catherine couldn &apos;t i.d. this guy ,
that &apos;s our only lead .
well , it &apos;s the most
widely prescribed blood thinner out there .
can you open his shirt ?
max , what are you looking for ?
well , his current state of death aside ,
your victim is young and
appears to be in good physical condition ,
which leads me to suspect that the victim
was prescribed this drug post @-@ op
not to treat a chronic heart condition .
yeah , max , good call .
he &apos;s got a surgical scar right here .
gall bladder .
maybe kidneys .
from the look of the scar , it appears that
he went under the knife in the last three months .
all right , max , listen , contact all area hospitals .
get a list of patients who have had similar surgeries .
cross @-@ reference them against our vic &apos;s description , okay ?
right away , commander .
i can &apos;t let you through .
sir , please ,
i ... i just need to find out if detective williams is okay .
i &apos;m sorry , ma &apos;am .
he &apos;s a friend of mine .
my name is amber vitale . if @-@ if there &apos;s anything ...
uh , she &apos;s good . she &apos;s with me .
amber ?
yeah .
i &apos;m kono . i work with danny .
i just saw it on the news ,
and i got over here as fast as i could ,
but nobody &apos;s telling me anything .
he &apos;s alive .
we &apos;re doing everything we can to get him to safety .
come on , i &apos;ll find you a seat .
danny &apos;s gonna want to see you when he gets out .
we any closer to getting those guys out ?
thanks to catherine , we know where they are ,
but , uh , still trying to find a way down .
how you holding up ?
i &apos;m , uh ... i &apos;m just trying to stay positive .
this is a lot worse than i imagined .
you got something , max ?
surgical records for every gall bladder and kidney operation
performed in the last three months .
23 patients match your john doe &apos;s description .
okay , good . i &apos;ll run the list through dmv
and see if i can put together a photo array .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s gonna be necessary .
take a look at this name .
marcus dekker .
so our victim is j.c. dekker &apos;s brother .
he &apos;s 25 years old .
he had his gall bladder removed last month ,
and warfarin was prescribed to him
to treat his post @-@ op clotting issues .
marcus just graduated from ucla law
four months ago .
he just moved home and was studying for the bar .
guess who bankrolled his education .
his big brother ?
that &apos;s right .
so how did their relationship go from that to this ?
unless dekker didn &apos;t put him down here .
what are you thinking , steve ?
dekker &apos;s been working with atf for months now , right ?
what if somebody he helped to put away found that out
and used it against him ?
right , so dekker gets
a fake tip about a gun deal ,
he passes it on .
they know he &apos;s gonna pass it on .
so , bomb goes off , few cops get killed ,
and , uh , dekker takes the fall .
and as added insult ,
they throw his brother down there to send a message .
it &apos;s a cold way to get revenge .
and we got caught in the middle .
marcus was a good kid , man .
he did well in school , never got into trouble .
i made sure of that .
i was always looking out for him .
so he wouldn &apos;t go down the same path as you .
that &apos;s why you put him through law school ?
when i got busted ,
marcus found out where the money came from .
he wanted nothing to do with me .
i was hoping to get out of here one day
and make things right .
and that &apos;s why you turned informant ,
so you could get an early release .
well , someone inside this prison
took exception to that .
two of our guys are trapped ,
and marcus is dead .
they tried to pin that all on you .
the tip came from a guy on my block ,
goes by the name of spider .
said he was giving me the info
&apos;cause he couldn &apos;t use it .
didn &apos;t that seem suspicious to you ?
guy &apos;s a lifer .
what good was it to him ?
think , j.c.
why would spider set you up ?
i don &apos;t know .
up until now , we &apos;ve been cool .
never had any beef with him .
let &apos;s pull his file .
i want to know everything about him before we get him in a room .
spider &apos;s never gonna talk to you .
you have nothing to offer a guy serving life .
there &apos;s another way to do this .
here .
i &apos;d prefer not to drink toilet water .
it isn &apos;t toilet water .
it &apos;s not from a fresh mountain spring , okay ,
but it &apos;s not sewage . it &apos;s drinkable ,
danny . take it .
don &apos;t look at it .
it &apos;s over 100 degrees down here .
if you want to live , drink the water .
ah , it &apos;s awesome .
we &apos;ve looked at every possible extraction point .
none are stable enough to bring in the equipment
we need to get down there .
hey , how are we supposed to get them out ?
we can &apos;t . at least not from where they are .
we got to get them moving .
now , there &apos;s a mechanical room 30 yards from their position .
if they can somehow make their way over there ,
we may be able to pull them up through the ventilation shaft .
30 yards . that might as well be 30 miles .
well , i didn &apos;t say it was gonna be easy .
they &apos;re gonna have to navigate some tight spaces ,
move heavy debris with little to no light .
well , they &apos;ll never make it . danny &apos;s injured .
hank , just tell me one thing .
is this our only option ?
if we do nothing , they &apos;ll run out of oxygen .
oh , good . the , uh ... escape @-@ through @-@ the @-@ vent trick .
that &apos;s @-@ that &apos;s the big plan ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do ? that &apos;s great .
it &apos;s our best shot .
okay , well , what about the part
where we &apos;re not supposed to touch anything ,
if we do , the whole thing could cave in on us ?
that &apos;s still true ,
so please be careful .
do me a favor .
you know that sushi place you like so much on king street ?
give them a call , make a reservation for tonight ,
you and me , okay ?
i &apos;m just gonna have to grab a quick shower first .
will do .
hey , danny , there &apos;s someone here who wants to talk to you .
it &apos;s okay .
hey , jersey .
hey , doll . you look fantastic .
been that kind of a day , huh ?
sorry about this morning . i meant to call you , but , uh ...
save it .
i &apos;ve heard that whole trapped @-@ under @-@ the @-@ building excuse before .
i &apos;d laugh , only it hurts too much .
how &apos;d you , uh ... how &apos;d you know to come down here ?
well , it was all over the news .
okay , amber , listen to me .
grace gets out of school in a little while ,
and , uh ... and rachel &apos;s out of town .
of course , i &apos;ll pick her up .
um ... what do you want me to tell her ?
uh , tell her that i &apos;m running late .
i &apos;ll be home in a little bit . um ...
listen , you can &apos;t let her use her phone ,
uh , can &apos;t let her leave the house ,
can &apos;t let her turn on the tv .
so , you want me to tell her she &apos;s grounded ?
exactly . tell her she &apos;s grounded .
she &apos;s gonna want to talk to you .
tell her i &apos;ll talk to her right when i get home .
surprise , bitch .
i &apos;m guessing that belonged to spider ?
his jaw &apos;s being wired shut right about now .
i doubt he &apos;ll be needing that .
so that explains how he coordinated the bombing .
contraband phone .
guards couldn &apos;t monitor his calls .
except spider had nothing to do with no bomb .
what are you talking about ?
he said , a couple weeks back ,
a stranger hit him up on his cell ,
told him to check his commissary balance .
资金通常来自家人朋友或在狱中打工所获报酬
he does , there &apos;s five gs in there .
so , next time mystery man calls ,
he &apos;s got spider &apos;s attention .
said there &apos;s another 20 large in it for him
if he gets me to drop a tip about an upcoming gun buy .
so this stranger on the outside used spider
to feed you the information .
and spider convinced me
the atf was selling me short ,
and you guys would give me a better deal .
turns out , he only got paid
if i delivered the tip to five @-@ 0 .
this was never about a prison beef .
this was someone coming after us .
we work together , we get out of here . all right ?
give me a hand with this thing .
the worst game of jenga ever .
she &apos;s pretty .
oh . what ?
amber . can tell she really cares about you , too .
yeah , i &apos;ll probably screw it up like i do everything else .
right ? not in my dna to be happy .
i didn &apos;t mean that . that &apos;s not what i meant .
no , i &apos;m officially agreeing with you .
there is something wrong with the way that i am built .
i @-@ i can &apos;t , uh ...
i can &apos;t just enjoy happiness like regular people , you know ?
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re being a little hard on yourself ?
no , i don &apos;t .
when i was a kid ,
my parents would go out to eat dinner .
if they were late coming home , i used to imagine that
they died in a car wreck ,
just &apos; cause they were 15 minutes late .
and i used to talk to god and beg him .
i said , &quot; please just take my dad , not my mom . &quot;
&apos;cause i couldn &apos;t live without my mom .
i mean , every time something good happens in my life ,
i @-@ i just ... i think of when it &apos;s gonna end .
that &apos;s all i can think about .
you for real ?
yeah .
that &apos;s not normal .
i know it &apos;s not normal .
listen to this .
on my wedding day ,
i &apos;m looking at rachel , just about to say &quot; i do . &quot;
and all i can see is the day she &apos;s gonna serve me
with divorce papers .
no joke .
and i ... i don &apos;t know , man .
the only sustained happiness i ever felt in my life
so far is grace .
and , you know , it &apos;s just a matter of time
before she turns 18 , and then she &apos;s out the door
and she ... marries some schmuck .

call me .
fong ran spider &apos;s cell . in the past 48 hours ,
he got three incoming calls , all from the same number .
we get a name ?
no , it &apos;s a burner .
but it &apos;s on right now , and we triangulated a position .
what &apos;s the location ?
it &apos;s an office building in chinatown .
there &apos;s only one tenant .
it &apos;s a consulting firm owned by an edward cobb .
edward cobb . who &apos;s edward cobb ?
and why the hell is he coming after us ?
edward cobb is ex @-@ cia .
he ran black ops in southeast asia in the &apos; 70s .
this was never about five @-@ 0 .
after being trapped under the rubble
for several hours , commander mcgarrett
and detective williams were rescued just a short time ago .
the cause of the explosion is still under investigation .
honolulu fire chief hank iona ...
looks like you had a bad day , commander .
not as bad as you would &apos;ve liked .
i know you set me up to
keep me quiet about cambodia .
but i &apos;m still here .
question is : have you gotten the message ?
no .
that &apos;s pretty clever .
they would &apos;ve pulled three bodies out of that rubble ,
assumed that dekker &apos;s brother was killed for payback
and five @-@ 0 got caught in the middle .
no one ever would &apos;ve suspected that
this was all about keeping me from asking questions
you didn &apos;t want answered .
you should &apos;ve listened to sam , left this alone .
an innocent man died today .
for no reason .
and dozens , dozens of innocent lives were put in danger ,
all to clean up a mess that you made 40 years ago .
now , what happened in cambodia ?
who was buried in that grave ?
consider your next move very carefully .
you consider yours .
i still got dna from that grave ,
and i &apos;m gonna run it .
so you might as well tell me who it belongs to .
lei kuan fat .
wo fat &apos;s mother .
why would you cover that up ?
because it wasn &apos;t supposed to be her in that grave .
our target was wo fat &apos;s father , but the op went bad .
my agent on the ground disappeared ,
leaving me to clean up her mess .
that agent was my mother .
but she went on to work for the agency ,
while you were forced out .
she didn &apos;t botch the job .
you ordered an unsanctioned hit that went bad .
wo fat &apos;s father is still alive , isn &apos;t he ?
do you have any idea the fallout
if that ever came to light ?
where is he ?
sit down .
