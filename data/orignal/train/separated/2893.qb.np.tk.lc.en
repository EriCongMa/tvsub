hey , you guys , hums while he pees just asked me out !
i thought that guy was married .
he is , but he &apos;s getting divorced .
ross , maybe you know him .
it &apos;s not a club .

hey , divorced men are not bad men .
they have that on the napkins at the club .
i gotta get back to work .
you don &apos;t have to be back for a half @-@ hour .
my assistant , tag , does sit @-@ ups in the office during lunch .
i could just spread him on a cracker .
you have a crush on him , why would you hire him ?
you know you can &apos;t date him , right ?
oh , no , i know that .
we made a joke that we spend so much time together ...
... he should call me , his &quot; work @-@ wife . &quot;
soon he &apos;ll be able to call you , &quot; that lady he knew that got fired . &quot;
i &apos;m not gonna get fired , because i &apos;m not gonna act on it .
you wouldn &apos;t mind if he was dating someone else ?
why , is he ? he is , isn &apos;t he ? he &apos;s dating that slut in marketing .

okay .
i did divert her , and we ended up having a great time , okay ?
watching ballroom dancing ?
yes , that &apos;s where we realized we were both super @-@ cool people .
look , kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her .
like what ?
like she &apos;s really mean ...
... and she &apos;s overly critical and ...
she will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you .
okay .
and she uses sex as a weapon .
thank you for warning me .
at breakfast , i &apos;ll be on alert for room painting and sex weapons .
you &apos;re still gonna go out with her ?
yeah .
well , didn &apos;t you hear what i just said ?
pheebs , come on . i mean , consider the source .
of course her ex @-@ husband &apos;s gonna say that stuff now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .

susars still in the hospital , and i &apos;m collecting money to send her flowers .
oh , my god , i &apos;m so sorry . okay . yes , of course .
just take it all . take it all . and please , please , give my best to emily .
i &apos;m emily .
yeah . no , i meant ...
... the other one that you said .
morning .
hi , tag .
did you have fun with joey last night ?
yeah , we went to the knicks game .
that &apos;s nice .
then we went to a bar , and he hooked us up with all these women .
women ? you mean , like old women ?
kind of old , like 30 .
i never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars ...
... but i got like 20 phone numbers last night .
that &apos;s great .
joey must have really taught you some stuff .
a little .
how you doing ?
see ? that &apos;s a great smile . easy , natural .
now pretend i have a camera .
you &apos;re changing it .
i can &apos;t help it .
you want to know what i do when i take resume shots ?
borrow money from me ?
yeah . okay , first of all , you want to make it look spontaneous .
so here &apos;s what i do . i look down , look down , keep looking down .
then i look up .
see ? now you try .
look down . you &apos;re looking down . keep looking down .
why is there jelly on your shoe ?
i had a doughnut .
so i heard you had some fun with tag last night .
yeah , that guy &apos;s all right .
yeah , and you had fun teaching him how to be all &quot; joey . &quot;
what ?
you know , all the women .
you can &apos;t teach someone to be good with women .
that &apos;s why i never had any luck with chandler .
i &apos;m right here .
would you mind just not going out with him again ?
just the idea of you , and he , and all these women ...
i know he &apos;s my assistant , and i can &apos;t date him !
but it just bothers me , all right ?
no , no , no , you can &apos;t take him away from me .
i got a great partner to pick up girls with . finally !
i &apos;m still right here .
will you at least talk to him ...
... and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating @-@ tons @-@ of @-@ women thing is ?
what ?
i just don &apos;t want him to meet anybody until i &apos;m over my crush .
and i will get over it .
it &apos;s not like i love him . it &apos;s just physical .
i get crushes like this all the time . i had a crush on you at first .
i know . monica told me .
did you have a crush on me when we first met ?
yeah , sure .
can you people not see me ?
will you talk to him ?
i don &apos;t know , rach .
i &apos;ll give you 10 free ralph lauren shirts .
one .
no , 10 . you said 10 . you can &apos;t take that back .
you wanted to talk to me ?
i don &apos;t know . you got something for me ?
yeah , this is from rachel .
ten . okay .
tag , there &apos;s such a thing as too many women .
really ?
yeah , for you .
hey , how much would it cost to get a big fan in here ?
hey , there you are
there i am .
you okay ?
yeah , joey said i needed to relax .
so he gave me an antihistamine .
what ?
i fell asleep on the subway and went to brooklyn .
brooklyn is far .
what were you thinking ?
but don &apos;t worry , because i know how to take a picture now .
okay , see . look down .
look down .
look down .
chandler ?
yeah ?
hi .
hi .
how are things going with crazy ? has she cooked your rabbit yet ?
listen , you are hearing one side of the story . okay ?
fyi , she must have shown kyle over 30 paint samples ...
... before she painted that room .
and his response to each one was , &quot; i don &apos;t give a tiny rat &apos;s ass . &quot;
maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating ...
... and a little more time in the bedroom .
i don &apos;t think we are going to have that problem ...
... but maybe that &apos;s just because i am not emotionally unavailable .
you think he &apos;s emotionally unavailable ?
i think he can be .
maybe he wouldn &apos;t be ...
... if she didn &apos;t bring the office home every night .
excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life .
well , she certainly knew what she was doing new year &apos;s eve , 1997 .
i knew you were going to throw that in my face !
that was three years ago . she apologized and apologized .
what more do you want ?
we want the last six years back !
so do we ! so do we !
i &apos;m sorry you had to see that .
morning , rachel .
hi .
hey , so , what &apos;d you do last night ?
went out with joey .
yeah ?
another night of bird @-@ dogging the chicas ?
no , we had a really good talk .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna do that bar scene anymore .
wow , i did not see that coming .
it &apos;s just not really who i am .
i &apos;ve always been happier when ... why am i telling you this ?
you don &apos;t care about this stuff .
yes , i do .
you were saying , &quot; i &apos;m happier when i ... &quot;
when i &apos;m in a relationship .
i love having a girlfriend .
really ?
someone i can spoil , you know .
spoil ?
let me ask you something .
do you believe there &apos;s one perfect person for everyone ?
i &apos;m starting to .
if that persors in your life , should you do something about it ?
yes . hell , yes .
all right , then , it &apos;s settled .
i &apos;m getting back together with my ex .
i would love to !
what ?
hello ?
this is gonna be a while . excuse me .
yeah .
yeah .
my god !
oh , i &apos;m sorry . is that annoying ?
and speaking of being selfish in bed , how &apos;s whitney ?
maybe she wouldn &apos;t have to be selfish in bed ...
... if someone else knew where everything was .
oh , he knows .
for the most part .
oh , hey . good , you &apos;re both here .
we kind of need to talk .
both of you , together ?
what &apos;s up ?
well , i went over to kyle &apos;s last night to pick up a few things ...
... and we got to reminiscing .
we talked most of the night ...
... and realized the reason we &apos;re angry with each other ...
... is because there are still feelings there .
so ...
oh , just say it , kyle !
we &apos;re gonna try again .
what about her whining , and her constant need for attention ?
i &apos;m gonna work on that .
right , because you &apos;re so capable of change .
you know , he hums when he pees .
i do know .
makes him miss the bowl , but whatever .
we &apos;re so sorry .
that &apos;s all right . we don &apos;t need you . i &apos;m over it already .
yeah , and i don &apos;t even give a tiny rat &apos;s ass .
yeah , we &apos;re gonna go .
i &apos;m sorry .
pheebs , you were right about her .
you know , she did try to use sex as a weapon .
yeah , i hurt my back a little .
you know , he hums while he does other stuff too .
we &apos;re better off without them .
even if they break up again , you better not let him in your sad mers club .
divorced men &apos;s club .
po @-@ tay @-@ to , po @-@ tah @-@ to .
you know , pheebs , we don &apos;t talk that much anymore .
yeah .
hey , guys , check it out .
my mom sent me the paper .
let &apos;s see it .
oh , yeah , that looks good .
you make a very attractive couple .
yeah , we look great together .
we really do .
okay .
imagine what our kids would look like .
we don &apos;t have to imagine .
i &apos;m marrying her .
