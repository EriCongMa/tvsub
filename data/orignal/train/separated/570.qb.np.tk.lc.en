i wonder how the dean scored this sweet spread .
chef gaga never reveals her caterer .
and don &apos;t try reading my p @-@ p @-@ p @-@ poker face .

i didn &apos;t read your poker face .
you left the containers in the garbage .
oh , well , um , you guys have fun .
i &apos;m gonna--gonna take out the garbage .
oh , you may also want to adjust your itunes setting .
when it &apos;s not playing an endless loop of abba &apos;s greatest hits ,
it &apos;s playing what i think may be your personal voice memos .
what ?
note to self-- get oil changed ,
check netflix for that movie where greg kinnear ...
plays a ghost-- no , an angel--
and something called human centi--
david beckham .
hmm .
dragon turtle ?
t @-@ rex .
man , i wonder how much effort
you put into being accidentally handsome
for a costume every year .
only half the effort
you &apos;ll be putting into eating and drinking tonight .
let me help you , dragon turtle .
guys , shirley &apos;s costume is once again unwittingly ambiguous .
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s supposed to be ,
but i do know she &apos;s not miss piggy .
i repeat-- she is not miss piggy .
you &apos;re on your own .
hello ! guess who i am .
um , can &apos;t you just say ?
no .
pierce , are you okay ?
huh ? what ? huh ?
whoa .
hey , if you get any more sweaty and puffy ,
your costume &apos;s gonna reach new levels of authenticity .
oh , i don &apos;t understand . shut up .
he &apos;s acting like the impression of him we do behind his back .
get away from me !
oh , man , just when you think it &apos;s funny .
pierce ?
okay , okay , okay . ooh .
oh , excuse me .
i think my friend is really sick .

but you look fantastic .
oh , thank you .

you &apos;re safe now .
but if that thing comes back ,
i &apos;m gonna need one or both of your phone numbers .
yeah , right .
i don &apos;t get it .
how do you do it ?
well , i am wearing a $ 6,000 suit ,
and you spent 3 days making cardboard robot armor .
you &apos;re saying they feel sorry for you ?
i &apos;m saying i remind girls less
of taking their little brothers to comic @-@ con .
rich .

put her with the others .
102--this may be food poisoning .
rich , what did i tell you ?

but also not to say the words out loud .

okay , i &apos;m ruling out food poisoning .
第二季第六集
guess who i am .
michelle kwan ?
wrong .
kristi yamaguchi ?
peggy fleming .
just been proven racist by the racist @-@ prover .
hey , guess who i am .
drink .
have you noticed a weird vibe
taking a hold of this party ?
it &apos;s like every fifth person is on
something seriously hard @-@ core .
yeah , i wonder who &apos;s holding ... the key to your riddle .
where &apos;s your costume ?
trying something new .
but our costumes go together , and if you &apos;re not in yours ,
i &apos;m just a guy in a spandex suit
and a bike helmet .
well , i &apos;m a sexy dracula .
you mean vampire .
i don &apos;t need to know which dracula i am
to be a dracula .
nerd .
your symptoms are progressing even faster than everyone else &apos;s .
how much of that taco @-@ meat stuff did you eat , star @-@ burns ?
i didn &apos;t eat any .
my name is alex !
whatever it is must have transferred through pierce &apos;s bite .
my god , i think you &apos;re right .
annie , you make quite the little nurse .
thank you , rich .
you &apos;re quite a banana .
jeez , why don &apos;t you guys just get a roo--
but the only people getting sick are the ones eating
what i bought at your surplus store .
i never said the stuff was delicious ,
but you can &apos;t get sick from it .
it &apos;s nonperishable .
what about the taco @-@ meat stuff--
the classic flavor ?
the what ?
the one with the goofy label .
what goofy label
&quot; classified phoenix .
if found , repeat key phrase--
echo , tango , x @-@ ray , nine , nine , seven . &quot;
yeah . sounds delicious .
anyway , it looks like taco meat and--
hello ?
greendale community college ?
speaking .
this is special operations officer mchenry .
hi .
i need you to listen to me very carefully .
okay , one hint .
i &apos;m a beloved character from our childhood .
i can &apos;t stop seeing it .
i know .
leonard , behave yourself .
i &apos;m a christian woman .
leonard , you better back that pumpkin ass up ,
or i will make a pie .
hey , jeff , it &apos;s me , rich , from pottery class .
&quot; doc potterywood , &quot; remember ? &apos; cause we were--
rich , bigger fish .
yeah .
guys , there &apos;s some kind of infection at the party
that &apos;s making people act weird and bite each other .
we need to coordinate an orderly evacuation
without causing unnecessary panic .
holy crap !
leonard &apos;s a zombie !
zombie attack !
never mind .
oh , my god ! ah !
i &apos;m sorry .
open the door !
i &apos;ve been told we need a little baby quarantine
until the army gets here .
the army ?
i know , right ?
they said to wait for six hours .
stay strong .
guys ...
i hate to be the &quot; we &apos;ve got company &quot; guy , but--
hey , guess who i am .
or don &apos;t .
head to the back !
run !
you punched a lady bee !
no !
let go of the door , you little bitch !
welcome !
oh , thank god you &apos;re all right !
whoo ! we did it !
okay , did we lose anybody out there ?
no .
is anybody hurt ?
no .
okay , last question , and i know it &apos;s a long shot ,
but did anybody happen to shut off the dean &apos;s playlist ?
two percent milk , eggs , deodorant , puppy chow ...
okay , it &apos;s a officially a waking nightmare .
when are the police coming ?
help is on the way .
hello ?
help is on the way .
hello ?
help is on the way .
flavor flav was right .
it &apos;s the end of days .
it can &apos;t be the end of days .
it &apos;s not 2012 yet .
it &apos;s not the end of days .
there seems to be a rabies @-@ related pathogen
affecting the prefrontal cortex of the brain ,
causing hyper aggression .
it could take years for it to take over the world .
how many years ?
1 , 1.1 / 2 .
2012 ! end of days !
end of days ! end of days !
good thinking , jeff--
vertical fold .
you making fun of me ?
that jacket is worth more than the island
you were grown on , chiquita m.d.
&quot; chiquita m.d. &quot; -- i like it .
rich , this is a good time to let you know that i hate you .
shouldn &apos;t we be barricading the room ?
i don &apos;t know . these guys don &apos;t seem so--
i will help you .
wait ! wait !
before you barricade us in ,
i need to ask if anyone has been bitten .
you bit , huh ? you bit ?
this pathogen is spread through bites ,
so if anyone has been bitten and you allow us
to seal ourselves in here with you ,
you &apos;re putting us all in danger .
all right , go ahead .
are we really just gonna sit here ?
the army &apos;s gonna be here in six hours .
why six hours ? are they hosting the oscars ?
damn .
and the winner for best adapted oscar burn ,
jeff winger for &quot; oh , snap ! the man who went there . &quot;
those people don &apos;t have six hours .
judging from the temperatures of those infected ...
within three hours , they &apos;re gonna start suffering from brain damage .
three hours after that , they &apos;re gonna be dead .
what ? we have to do something for them .
do something ? for the zombies ?
if we lower the temperature of the whole building ,
would it break the fever and kill the virus ?
it might .
i know where the thermostat is--out there on the wall .
troy , we have to rise to the occasion like ripley
and kick monster butt in our undies .
i &apos;m not ripley , abed .
i &apos;m a cool , sexy dracula .
i make love to ladies , and i survive .
i &apos;m with troy .
guys , those are not zombies .
those are our classmates , and they &apos;re sick .
and they can make us sick by biting us .
the banana said so .
it &apos;s true .
the incubation only takes minutes .
first , you get a stomachache .
then your skin turns red , followed by cold sweats .
muscle spasms , high fever ,
and then the uncontrollable urge to bite uninfected flesh .
oh , jesus .
and i forgot one symptom .
slurred speech .
hey , you got bit !
i felt like maybe i was special .
special ? you &apos;re not special .
i &apos;m special .
i was bit ten minutes ago , and i &apos;m ...
fine .
oh , great .
nobody is special !
hey , rich , just so you know , i hate you less now .
that &apos;s how much i hate your normal self .
you have to destroy his brain .
what the hell ?
a hamster !
way to go !
run !
run ! run !
head for the stairs !
what about annie ?
don &apos;t look back !
why not ?
shirley , oh , god .
don &apos;t look back !
occupied !
oh , this is how i die ... as miss piggy .
you &apos;re not miss piggy .
you &apos;re glenda the good witch .
oh ! you knew ?
just so you know , i &apos;ve always loved peggy fleming .
you &apos;re not racist .
oh , cool .
a dark basement .
i was just thinking we should be doing this in a dark basement .
troy , why did you ditch your costume ?
why bring that up now , abed ? we might die down here .
all the more reason to get this ironed out .
you called me a nerd up there . what defines a nerd--
committing to an awesome halloween costume
with your best friend ?
is that what nerds do ?
i don &apos;t know , abed , because i &apos;m not a nerd ,
which is why i &apos;m not taking part in this very conversation .
shh ! nerds .
did you hear that ?
jeez !
it was just a cat .
let &apos;s keep moving .
oh ! holy crap !
what is up with that cat ?
is someone throwing it ?
no !
let &apos;s not keep moving ,
because there is an insane cat down here .
well , what about the zombies ?
back burner , troy ! this cat has to be dealt with .
there it is ! grab it !
this should lead upstairs . the thermostat will be--
enough with the thermostat , abed .
this is not pretend play time , save @-@ the @-@ world time .
it &apos;s quarter past
let &apos;s @-@ get @-@ the @-@ hell- out @-@ of @-@ this @-@ building time .
there . there &apos;s a window .
all right , if we climb that dusty fence ,
we can hoist each other against he wall
and then squeeze through it .
i vote we take the door .
he doesn &apos;t want to dirty his suit .
for real ?
clothes make the man , troy .
what the ...
that &apos;s my jacket !
my jacket-- you &apos;re stretching it !
you &apos;re stretching it !
wrong way ! go back ! go back ! go ! go !
go .
i &apos;m not going without you !
troy , make me proud .
be the first black man to make it to the end .
go , go , go , go , go !
abed !
i love you .
i know .
make it fast .
no !
troy , be honest .
are you a zombie ? i will mace you .
give me the keys .
those people are gonna get brain damage
if someone doesn &apos;t help &apos; em .
okay , troy , there is something called
&quot; chain of command , &quot; so unfortunately--
are you crazy ?
how are you gonna survive those zombies ?
i &apos;m gonna be a nerd .
better have a plan &quot; b &quot; !
that &apos;s right .
prepare to meet the power of imagination .
all right , i don &apos;t know why i thought this would work .
hey , get off me !
get off-- you &apos;re so strong !
god , i hate this !
get off !
stop using your mouth !
hello , zombie annie .
what big fists you have ...
in your face !
beam this up , scotty .
in your face !
zombie shirley ...
i don &apos;t know what you are , but--
in your face !
abed , we &apos;re friends .

i think it might be all of &apos; em .
all right , scenario &quot; b. &quot;
repeat , scenario &quot; b. &quot;
let &apos;s dose these suckers .
dose what now ?
so you remember nothing past your decision to be lady gaga ?
can &apos;t believe that somebody would mass @-@ roofie an entire party .
i can &apos;t believe it wasn &apos;t me .
i can &apos;t believe i believe you ...
and i don &apos;t .
want to watch a movie ?
sure .
aliens , cyborgs , or zombies ?
i don &apos;t know why , but i &apos;m kind of over zombies .

for a viewing of marmaduke .
