the plan failed . we can &apos;t decode the message .
call raymond reddington .
from wu jing .
good god . not here .
the gentleman i usually contract with is unavailable --
stung by a manta ray off the barrier reef in belize .
i have another tech in mind .
this needs to be done quickly .
today ?
speak with luli about the replacement i &apos;m offering .
conduct your due diligence .
if things are in order , we can proceed as discussed .
i prefer to play with myself in private .
are you okay ?
yeah , sorry .
i &apos;m just a little distracted .
no , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m ... sitting here talking about what happened to me
like it only happened to me .
but it happened to us both .
it &apos;s just a little weird to be home because ...
lizzy , a man came into our home .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
i wish i could tell you more .
i want to tell you more . i --
so , tell me something . who was he ?
he &apos;s gone . he was killed .
so it &apos;s over ?
yes .
look , i love you .
that &apos;s ellie .
i just hate that there are things you have to hide from me .
good morning !
hope you &apos;re hungry . i &apos;m making breakfast .
oh , you don &apos;t have to do that .
are you kidding ?
a good omelet has healing powers .
bruce and melissa are bringing over dinner tonight .
that &apos;s incredibly cool of you .
hey , friends don &apos;t let friends starve
when they &apos;ve been stabbed by violent psychopaths .
how &apos;s he doing ?
i &apos;m sitting right here .
i &apos;m not asking you .
you &apos;ll say fine ,
because that &apos;s what you do . you &apos;re a good actor .
karen &apos;s covering my classes .
we &apos;re gonna eat and then head over to physical therapy .
i got to run . ellie , we owe you .
so true .
you know i wouldn &apos;t go if i didn &apos;t have to .
look , whatever they pulled you into ,
the sooner you get it over with , the sooner we get our life back .
okay .
bye .
slug and casing from a 9 @-@ millimeter .
can you run these
and see if they match any crimes in our system ?
an opportunity has come our way .
yesterday , the chinese killed a c.i.a. agent in shanghai .
they took his computer ,
which they thought could decode a message they intercepted .
it couldn &apos;t .
they &apos;ve asked me to help .
oh , rodrick is a dear old friend .
i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re decoding c.i.a. messages on behalf of the chinese ?
now , you see , you make it sound like treason .
so black and white . it &apos;s not . it &apos;s green .
the fact is , american secrets are for sale
by an assortment of reputable vendors , myself included .
if i don &apos;t do this , someone else will .
the man who &apos;s paying me is called wu jing .
perhaps you &apos;ve heard of him .
formerly , he worked for the ministry of state security .
he &apos;s not officially sanctioned by the chinese .
but unofficially , he &apos;s contracted
to take out rival agents -- american , british .
the message likely contains the name of another agent .
do you expect me to believe that --
a secret meeting with the mysterious wu jing ?
intriguing , isn &apos;t it ?
he &apos;s a myth .
that &apos;s what they said about deep throat and the g @-@ spot .
i assure you wu jing is quite real , and he &apos;s hired me .
now you have the chance to catch him .
i &apos;ve already forwarded them your cover .
what ? what cover ?
carolyn givins ,
phd in applied physics from m.i.t ..
i &apos;ve told them you &apos;re my new encryption specialist .
you &apos;re asking me to betray the life of an american agent .
listen , this is a guy who the intelligence community
has been talking about for decades
as if he were a figment .
you don &apos;t even know if he &apos;s real or not .
well , he is real -- very .
and i &apos;m giving you the opportunity to grab him .
now , the good news is he &apos;s not even in china .
he &apos;s right here in your own backyard .
if we play our cards right ,
i can still make lisbon by breakfast .
rodrick , both .
michael alvarado , kevin wyatt ,
bryce jensen .
three agents based in china , three covers blown .
according to reddington ,
all were murdered by a man named wu jing .
who is wu jing ?
china has a one @-@ child policy .
they say that wu jing was a second child .
so they gave him away , denied he was ever born .
he was invisible to his family .
wu jing made a life working in a business
where invisibility was an incredible asset .
reddington &apos;s told you he can find this guy ?
he claims wu jing has hired him to decode a message
that the chinese have intercepted from the c.i.a.
he believes that it might contain the identify
of another one of our assets in china .
i think we should move on this .
i &apos;m not prepared to do this .
i understand you have reservations .
reservations ?
you &apos;re asking me to spy on a notorious spy killer
while pretending to be an expert in cryptography ,
which i know nothing about .
reddington insists on you .
i &apos;m sorry .
look at those pictures .
if there is a name in that message ,
there &apos;s gonna be another face in that file .
that &apos;ll be on you .
i &apos;ll be back in a second . i just need to grab my purse .
i thought it was on the counter .
hello ?
hey . did you find it ?
oh , yeah , sorry . i &apos;m coming .
okay . say i do this , what &apos;s in it for me ?
look at you , camel trading like a bedouin .
if i &apos;m gonna help you , i want something in return .
such as ?
the truth . just once .
i want to know why you chose me .
well , then , we need to move quickly .
things are already in play .
wdcj --
a small radio station five miles from here .
the building was purchased six years ago
by a corporation fronting for the chinese government .
i &apos;m sorry . wait .
you &apos;re telling us that wu jing is running a spy ring
out of a radio station ?
we &apos;ll meet wu jing .
you &apos;ll decode the message and transmit it to your team .
if i decode the message ,
that means the chinese get it , too .
exactly -- both you and the chinese
will know the name of the agent
for which the message was intended ,
and the race begins .
we try to save him . the chinese try to kill him .
we could give them a false message .
no .
that could work . we could send them in the wrong direction .
i said no .
the chinese may not know what the message is ,
but they certainly know what it isn &apos;t .
we do it for real , or we don &apos;t do it at all .
great plan , except , as i have said ,
i know nothing about encryption .
you &apos;re a very quick study .
i have a guy who can help you with that .
the chinese will give you an intercepted message
on one of these .
insert it , and it will prompt you to connect a data locker .
shun lee says it &apos;s like a magic box .
a magic box ?
the data locker applies a key to the message .
it &apos;ll take a moment ,
but the decoded message will appear on your laptop .
how do i get the message out ?
you don &apos;t . the computer does it for you .
all you need is a satellite connection .
if you don &apos;t have a satellite connection , use this .
it &apos;s a remote mirroring program .
it &apos;ll give our tech on the outside control of the system .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
great . you &apos;re rocking the mandarin .
xie xie .
three minutes till the meeting , sir .
where the hell is reddington ? he &apos;s late .
he &apos;s gonna blow this whole damn thing .
do you smoke ?
no .
well , you do now .
or at least you &apos;re trying to quit .
this is c.i.a. equipment . it &apos;s brand @-@ new .
it looks like a nicotine patch ,
but it &apos;s a very sensitive transmitter .
it has a range of 300 yards , and it &apos;s a plastic polymer ,
which means it won &apos;t show up if it gets wanded .
and if you &apos;re wrong ?
i &apos;m not wrong .
where the hell is he ?
he was supposed to be here an hour --
what are we waiting for ?
surveillance one , are you in position ?
roger that . in position .
satellite feed up and running .
right this way .
here we go .
sorry , sir . protocol .
miss , please .
thank you . sir ?
darpa tracking chip , 8 @-@ millimeter tag .
i was taken by somali pirates last march ,
spent three weeks in a shipping container .
the first two were a nightmare .
the third one was actually quite pleasant .
even so , that won &apos;t happen again .
if you have a clean razor blade and some morphine ,
i &apos;ll remove it .
that won &apos;t be necessary , but i am going to need
a biometric print scan from your associate .
she &apos;s with me .
understood .
but my orders are to scan any new visitors .
what database is this being run against ?
all of them .
what &apos;s happening ?
they are running her prints .
can you intercept them ?
i don &apos;t know .
so , you went with the gray ?
okay .
vanish .
follow me .
as you can see , we &apos;ve made some improvements .
oh , your darpa chip won &apos;t work where you &apos;re going .
wu jing will explain when you get there .
get where ?
what the hell just happened ?
we lost them .
we can &apos;t just lose them .
what happened to our signal ?
they seem to be descending ,
which doesn &apos;t make any sense .
the blueprints don &apos;t show any underground space .
get that signal back .
how far down do you think we &apos;re going ?
far enough .
my friend .
don &apos;t be cheeky , wu jing . you don &apos;t have any friends .
my associate .
ms. givins .
professor robins only works with the best .
oh , he was an amazing teacher .
i was so sorry to hear that he passed away .
you &apos;ve made some changes .
we had to increase security . - i can imagine --
four american agents killed in the past year and a half .
you &apos;ve been busy .
i presume nothing gets in or out ,
no radio or satellite transmissions .
nothing but trust .
please don &apos;t take offense .
i can &apos;t risk american surveillance .
only our systems are hard @-@ wired to the outside world .
let &apos;s get to work .
i once had a bad experience in a deep hole in the ground .
jin sun , my new senior cryptographer .
we expected standard rsa encryption ,
but this was something stronger .
the government &apos;s been experimenting
with better factoring algorithms .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before rsa &apos;s obsolete .
you &apos;re right . it is .
i &apos;ll just need a few moments to set up my equipment .
this way .
they &apos;re trying , but still nothing .
either the chinese are scrambling our signals ,
or liz and red are out of range .
i thought your equipment had a range of 300 yards .
it does , but maybe they &apos;ve built a bunker
that deep under the building .
we &apos;re getting played .
that signal went dark because red and liz wanted it to .
that &apos;s not likely .
how long can we wait to find out ?
is it possible they could be in danger ?
that &apos;s another reason not to wait .
keep all insertion teams on standby .
if we don &apos;t hear from agent keen in five minutes , we &apos;re going in .
we ready yet ?
do you get home much , jin sun ?
not for two years .
oh , that must be hard . it certainly would be for me .
i don &apos;t even have a phone .
i insist on delivering all of my messages in person .
what province are you from ?
from yunnan .
oh , beautiful part of the country .
i spent a month in silent meditation
at a monastery just outside of kunming .
探员会被杀害
探员会被杀害
it was a wonderful escape
from the distractions of everyday life .
i can &apos;t imagine the distractions one might encounter down here .
can you ?
no . i can &apos;t .
excellent .
i think we &apos;re almost ready . this should be fun .
what the hell is that ?
i swear , if i run into the same trouble
i had with you in hong kong ...
in all the years you and i have known each other ,
i &apos;ve never put you in a position like this .
you know how i conduct my business .
i don &apos;t need this kind of crap .
you assured me this place was secure .
it is .
then what the hell is that ? !
that van .
it was there when we arrived , and it &apos;s still there .
that is the fbi .
with all the scans and wands
and this elevator you &apos;ve built that goes down to middle earth ,
and you don &apos;t even bother to sweep the street
around your building ? this is nonsense .
calm down , old friend .
you &apos;re under surveillance !
if the fbi was outside , it &apos;s because you led them here .
i &apos;ve been moving comfortably through the world
for the past 20 years without a trace .
and now some two @-@ bit spy killer
is gonna put my life and business in jeopardy ?
we have activity . everybody , heads up .
we &apos;re made . your 2 o &apos;clock . break it down . 15 seconds .
we got to go . pack it up .
you !
they know we &apos;re here .
maybe ,
or maybe the van &apos;s just
been there too long and they &apos;re being careful .
i don &apos;t like it . we &apos;re going in on my signal .
unbelievable .
you see ? nothing .
now ... can we continue ?
you should be ashamed of yourself .
to put ms. givins and i at risk , it &apos;s unprofessional .
i &apos;ve reached my limit .
enough !
what ?
okay . okay . you know , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ve had a rough day .
unbelievable .
should we do this ?
let &apos;s roll . e.t.a. -- one minute .
the message .
don &apos;t you miss the good old days
with the pay phones and the brush pasts ?
30 seconds out .
wait . i &apos;ve got something .
she &apos;s using the remote mirroring program .
meera &apos;s contact gave her .
uh , hang on . this isn &apos;t her computer .
it looks like one of the chinese systems .
can you see the c.i.a. message ?
yes , sir , and a lot more than that . downloading now .
10 seconds out .
okay , all units , stand down .
i repeat , stand down .
i repeat , all units stand down .
standing down .
there &apos;s your next target -- kill number five .
henry cho .
we have the message . the target is henry cho .
all right . the clock is ticking .
i want everything we can find on this guy .
this was sent from a c.i.a. server ,
delivered to a server at the nanjing grand hotel .
so , mr. cho , why is the c.i.a. sending you secret messages
at your hotel ?
hold on . this guy &apos;s not an agent .
he &apos;s chinese @-@ american , an architect .
an architect ?
then why the hell is he talking to the c.i.a. ?
because we asked for his help .
henry cho works for zhongku construction .
not in china , here in d.c.
zhongku -- they &apos;re a huge construction company .
they design buildings all over the world .
his immigration file says he &apos;s been to the company headquarters
6 times in the last 10 months .
that &apos;s why the c.i.a. reached out to him .
zhongku &apos;s designing a new government building in shanghai .
we asked henry to use his access to get us the plans .
thanks to him , our ops bugged the entire city military commission .
let me get this straight .
this guy &apos;s not a trained operative .
he &apos;s just a ... contractor ?
a civilian .
where is he now ?
here .
immigration says he left china three days ago ,
a return flight to dulles airport .
thank you , aram . you &apos;re welcome .
go get him .
zhongku construction .
henry cho , please .
it &apos;s very important that i speak to him immediately .
his brother , xiaoping , has been in a car accident .
he &apos;s at our fairview property with his son .
i can try to call him --
there &apos;s no answer on his cell .
call the company . find out where he is .
my friend , i can &apos;t thank you enough .
this is all the thanks i require .
get your things . it &apos;s time to go .
leave it .
lock it down .
stop !
you were right .
maybe that was the f.b.i. outside .
in fact , maybe they &apos;re not just outside .
maybe they &apos;re right here in this room .
think hard before you accuse anybody of anything .
a few minutes ago ,
contact was made from this room to an fbi server .
a message i worked so hard to intercept
was sent to the americans .
well , all my instincts said it was her .
i trust my instincts .
you &apos;re smart .
the one responsible was smart ,
but our systems are smarter .
any contact with a government server is flagged for review .
so ...
i know who betrayed us .
he &apos;s not at the office .
he &apos;s with a client at a property at fairview and wallace .
try him again .
so , over here , they &apos;re gonna make some windows .
and out here ...
there &apos;s gonna be a balcony
that runs the length of the whole build--
you said we were gonna get ice cream .
okay .
let me just show you something else first .
get him up .
i thought you were loyal to us .
i don &apos;t understand .
the message was sent from your system , jin sun .
t @-@ that &apos;s not possible .
that &apos;s not possible .
it is , and not just one message .
you gave them everything ,
files we &apos;ve worked on for months !
nobody else had access .
we have to do something .
quiet .
we can &apos;t just let them do this .
you --
as entertaining as all this has been ,
we really do need to leave now .
the next sound you hear is gonna be the fbi knocking on your door ,
and i , for one , am not gonna be here .
wu jing ! look at me !
you don &apos;t kill one of my people .
now i have to kill one of yours .
the moment he sent that message ,
he became worthless to you .
you would have beaten him for another 20 minutes
and then killed him yourself .
but if i let you kill a contractor of mine ,
i &apos;ll lose the trust of all my others ,
and that &apos;s just bad business .
so if you kill her , you better kill me .
or i &apos;m going to kill you .
you hired me to do a job . it &apos;s done .
now let &apos;s get out of here .
follow me .
i have another way out .
let &apos;s go get you some ice cream , all right ?
okay .
hello ?
mr. cho , this is agent meera malik with the c.i.a.
c.i.a. ? i don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re not supposed to be calling me on this line .
listen to me . you are in danger .
can you hear me ? the chinese have your name .
there are men on their way to your location .
we &apos;re on the 12th floor .
stay where you are .
we &apos;re coming to get you .
stay hidden . we &apos;re just minutes out .
dad ?
come here . come here . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;ve been building this place for three years ,
and now my operation is burned .
so build another .
sir , i &apos;ve got them .
the microchip in red &apos;s neck just came online
and the bug we put on agent keen .
they &apos;re out of the building , moving west on danforth .
where the hell are they going ?
just send agents to intercept them .
get underneath . get underneath .
listen . listen .
don &apos;t move , all right ?
just don &apos;t move .
no , put your hand in .
no !
stop ! dad !
dad ! dad ! dad ! dad !
hey ! hey ! hey ! hey ! let him go ! let my son go !
please ! please ! just let my son go ! please !
it &apos;s gonna be okay . it &apos;s gonna be okay . i &apos;ll do anything .
just let him go . it &apos;s gonna be all right .
it &apos;s gonna be all right . i promise . i promise .
dad !
ressler , clear !
ressler , clear ?
i &apos;m good . thanks .
thank you .
thank you for all you &apos;ve done for us .
i can get us out of the country .
that &apos;s very kind ,
but i &apos;m sure we can muddle through on our own .
anywhere in the shade up here would be fine .
i fear i &apos;ve disappointed you .
the deal was for us
to actually catch the criminals on the blacklist ,
and now wu jing is as good as halfway to beijing .
i don &apos;t think so .
is everything okay ?
we &apos;re fine .
move ! move ! let me see your hands !
get out ! get out ! get out !
up on the car !
the package is secure .
suspect in custody now .
luli can stay with me .
dembe will take you wherever you need to go .
you didn &apos;t have to kill him .
i believe i will always do
whatever i feel i have to do to keep you alive .
i held up my end of the deal . now it &apos;s your turn .
you owe me an answer .
what &apos;s the question ?
why me ?
because of your father .
what does that mean ?
did you know my father ?
have the two of you met somehow ?
i wish the answer were as simple as the question seems .
but the truth is , the question isn &apos;t simple , either .
i share your frustration .
you act like we &apos;re the same . you &apos;re wrong .
i have a life , people who care about me .
but you ... this is all you have .
i have you .
you okay ?
i &apos;ll live .
look , i just wanted to say , uh ...
maybe i &apos;ve had some doubts about you .
maybe i haven &apos;t done the best job of keeping them to myself ,
but what you did today was good work .
thanks .
if you didn &apos;t get that message out when you did ,
henry cho wouldn &apos;t be alive .
whatever else went down in there ,
you should feel good about that .
♬ caught in a riptide ♬

liz keen is hiding something .
i put a flag on her .
any tests , reports , or files--
anything she requests gets sent to us first .
she brought a bullet and a shell casing into ballistics .
at her level , the results were classified .
but that &apos;s the full report .
this isn &apos;t just classified .
any briefings on this homicide
include the secretary of homeland security .
