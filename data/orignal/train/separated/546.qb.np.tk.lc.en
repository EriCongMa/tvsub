a new day has dawned in greendale community college .
合屁为一
some said we &apos;d never bounce back
after the unfortunate events of the star @-@ burns wake riot
instigated by the greendale seven .
but today the guilty parties have been expelled ,
enrollment is up ,
and tuition is more affordable than ever .
the architect of this modern @-@ day miracle ?
security chief benjamin franklin chang ,
a man who has brought security , harmony , and success
to what is fast becoming the area &apos;s premier community college .
greendale &apos;s never been better . thanks , chang .
you see ? it &apos;s not the real dean .
of course .
the head of security at greendale community college
has kidnapped the dean
and replaced him with a deanel @-@ ganger .
well , when you say it that way , it sounds ridiculous .
yeah , the word we used was doppel @-@ deaner .
look , i hate cops .
you have to do something .
isn &apos;t this a felony ?
chang is holding a man against his will .
the real dean never would have expelled us .
he loved us .
unfortunately , love is not admissible evidence .
* love is not admissible evidence *
i &apos;m working on a cop opera .
cop @-@ ra !
police @-@ ical !
fine . we &apos;ll get some proof .
no , you won &apos;t .
if i catch any of you within
50 feet of greendale ,
i &apos;ll throw you all in jail .
thanks for the hot water .
wait , cop @-@ ra !
第三季第二十一集
i &apos;m watching you .
move along .
how &apos;s the planning going for my birthday chang @-@ stravaganza ?
the magician &apos;s booked , and the invitations went out
始于1995年美国超级碗期间百威啤酒的广告
to the school board and the budweiser frogs .
perfect .
yeah , um , one little snag .
see , we &apos;re kind of running out of money ,
what with all the students dropping out
and the cost of your throne .
it &apos;s a prescription throne .
i have back mumps .
don &apos;t look it up . it &apos;s rare .
but you might be right .
we should free up some revenue for entertainment at the party .
where &apos;s my deanel @-@ chang @-@ er ?
fire the custodial staff .
okay . cool .
do you think i could get out a little early ?
my wife &apos;s getting her braces off , and i--
no .
okay .
i love how binoculars make far away things
seem like they &apos;re close .
they &apos;re like telephones for your eyes .
snagged one of those flyers .
first chang kidnaps the dean ,
and now he throws himself a birthday party ?
it &apos;s just like stalin back in russia times .
dance @-@ off ? sundae bar ?
one of those ed hardy street magicians ?
what kind of monster would-- photo booth with props !
chang &apos;s got to be holding the dean on campus ,
but there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna get past those guards .
we need somebody on the inside .
i may know a guy .
and the air @-@ conditioning repair annex
won &apos;t admit to any knowledge of what &apos;s going on .
but the fact is , wherever there is air ,
we have eyes .
gross .
suffice it to say ,
if chang were holding your dean captive ,
it &apos;d be pretty foolish to hold him on campus .
it &apos;d be even more foolish to hold him
in a central air room
in the cafeteria , which we monitor .
oh , no , jeffrey . looks like pb and j again .
you win the bet .
so he &apos;s in the cafeteria building ?
suppose he is . in the basement .
and suppose you wanted to get to him .
suppose you actually managed to make it
past the guards at the front ,
there &apos;s 50 more inside , armed to the teeth
with stun batons and misplaced sexual aggression .
let &apos;s say you happen to get past them
and then you get to meet chang &apos;s number one ,
joshua ,
a 4 &apos; 10 , &quot; 105 @-@ pound bucket of piss and zit cream .
i cannot express to you how much i hate this kid .
now , beyond that dog sneeze in a pair of reeboks ,
you &apos;re gonna find a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art keypad on the basement door .
and just for extra fun , they change the code every day ,
and the only copy is locked up in chang &apos;s office .
now , just for a lark ,
let &apos;s pretend you actually make it down to the basement door .
who is there to greet you ?
another guard and another lock
to which there is only one key .
and where is that key ?
well where is it ?
oh , sorry , it &apos;s very clear in my head .
key &apos;s around chang &apos;s neck .
the point is , you &apos;re not getting down there without our help .
so help us .
we have no horse in this race ,
but ... there is one thing we want .
not a lot of people get a second chance .
just you and probably obama .
give it some thought .
great , so according to troy &apos;s intel ,
greendale is impregnable .
so what do we do ?
only one answer .
elaborate heist ? elaborate heist ?
we &apos;ll need disguises .
i do a great swami .
of course it works best with a cobra ,
but if you guys cut me a length of garden hose ...
are we all forgetting that if we get caught
on that campus , we go to jail ?
do you know how long someone as sarcastic as i am
would last in prison ?
such a long time .
there &apos;s got to be a practical way to do this .
there is another way in .
if i enroll in the a.c. school , they &apos;ll help us .
we could walk in and out .
it &apos;ll mean i &apos;ll have to move out of here
and into a.c. school housing ,
and i won &apos;t be able to hang out with you guys anymore ,
or have a relationship ,
or use the word &quot; sensational &quot; for some reason .
troy , we are not losing you to save the dean
or greendale ... or anything , ever .
don &apos;t be so dramatic , troy .
the answer is simple .
we just have to plan an elaborate heist .
yes .
great , i &apos;ll get my turban .
everyone except pierce has to plan an elaborate heist .
昌王庆生会现场
happy birthday , ben .
on behalf of the school board .
shower organizer ?
are you guys psychic ?
well you deserve it .
you have worked wonders here .
oh , you boners .
now go party your butts off .
your butt could use it , richie .
listen up , men .
keep an extra deep lookout for the greendale seven .
i won &apos;t have them ruining my 25th birthday .
yes , sir .
by the way , your cake just arrived .
shirley will enter first
through the loading dock disguised as the chef .
from there , she &apos;ll head into the kitchen .
you had time to build a tiny working water fountain ,
and i &apos;m a pinecone ?
* chang eats the sun *
* and drinks the skies *
* and they both go with him when he dies *
once in , she &apos;ll unload the goods .
this girl in chicago won &apos;t stop facebooking me .
looks like j @-@ swag &apos;s going deep dish .
then it &apos;s time for phase two--
toilet trouble .
oh , crap !
someone call a plumber !
sounds like you schnooks got a flood
the size of my wife &apos;s attitude problem .
whoa , you guys aren &apos;t the usual plumbers .
oh , mr. brand loyalty over here .
okay , okay , why don &apos;t you two slap @-@ arounds
give me your names for the report
in case chang wants to know why his birthday party
turned into the frickin &apos; poseidon adventure .
okay , okay . follow me then .
finally . oof baboof with you two .
here &apos;s your problem .
you people gotta start chewin &apos; your food .
we may have to tap into the hydraulic flap valve ,
so don &apos;t be alarmed if things get a little noisy .
like my wife &apos;s mouth .
if we can break through this wall and into chang &apos;s office ,
then we &apos;ll have access to the basement door codes .
meanwhile , i &apos;ll take care of cancelling the magician .
yeah , sorry , mr. nightshade , gig &apos;s canceled .
how &apos;s it coming with the guard ?
boys are pathetic .
two days of facebooking with this joshua kid
and he &apos;s eating out of my hands .
&quot; got a new flavor of lip balm .
&quot; meet me at chili &apos;s in ten minutes . &quot;
sheep .
um , i just want to reiterate that this should be
the only time you seduce a child over the internet .
i know .
chili &apos;s ? sick !
hey , bro , you watch my post ?
yeah , whatever . &apos; sup .
i &apos;m in .
cue the abra cadabra .
is that me in my swami disguise ?
no , pierce , for the last time ,
you &apos;re in the getaway van
because your swami act is notoriously horrible .
&quot; a , &quot; that is racist .
&quot; b , &quot; swamis can &apos;t drive-- they &apos;re indians .
pierce , just do your part .
leave the entertainment to britta and me .
ricky nightshade , the rock and roll magician .
i &apos;m starting . i need a volunteer .
i &apos;ll kill anyone who raises their hand .
pick a card and look at it .
strap him !
i &apos;m in .
okay , it was just my head before ,
but now i &apos;m really in .
bingo .
派尔顿院长囚室
4 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 6 .

i don &apos;t remember .
nightshade , nightshade !
greetings , greetings , baba ghanoush .
take me to the birthday boy .
wait a minute .
pierce ?
no , not knowing this pierce .
i--i am a mystical swami .
i come to boogie down , i &apos;m boogying down .
jeff , we &apos;ve been made .
cover me !
winger !
no !
everything all right , ben ?
peachy keen , avril lavigne .
nathan , tell me you got eyes on the dean .
negative , the pixie has left the toadstool .
no ! where &apos;s my monitor ?
gotcha .
code chang .
all units converge on the south library hallway .
the best part of the plan is that at a certain point ,
it &apos;s going to look like the plan is failing .
but that &apos;s when it &apos;s going to turn out that the failing plan
was all part of the plan .
* chang eats the sun and drinks the sky *
hey , johnny passerby , this job &apos;s getting bigger
than my wife &apos;s credit card bill at marshalls .
i mean , they got great stuff , i know that .
anyway , i &apos;m going to need your dean for approval .
craig . is that &quot; a @-@ i &quot; or &quot; i @-@ a &quot; ?
i always forget .
oof baboof , i spilled plumber &apos;s acid all over yous .
what do i do ? what do i do ?
take off your clothes .
nathan , tell me you got eyes on the dean .
negative , the pixie has left the toadstool .
repeat , the pixie has left the toadstool .
jeffrey ! oh ... hey , britta .
how the chang ?
i &apos;m contaminated with plumber &apos;s acid ,
but it &apos;s okay , they &apos;re coming back with a lotion .
sar @-@ cas @-@ tic claps .
pretty clever .
a plan that looked like it failed ,
and then turned out to work .
too bad your real plan really failed .
what &apos;s so funny ?
you idiot .
the plan was for the plan to seem like it was failing .
you think you caught us ,
but we &apos;ve already made it out
with the real dean .
ocean &apos;s eleven , baby .
pierce , i &apos;m the real dean .
getting caught the first time was part of the plan .
this time is because we suck .
shirley , where the hell did you come from ?
you can &apos;t hold us here forever .
i don &apos;t need to , winger .
i just wouldn &apos;t want you to leave before the big fireworks show .
fireworks show ?
it &apos;s a surprise for the end of the night
planned by the &quot; dean . &quot;
only , silly dean ,
he stored all the fireworks in the records room .
and when the works &quot; accidentally &quot; go off
when i hit the final note on my awesome keytar solo ,
they &apos;ll burn up the school &apos;s records
and all evidence of my misdeeds .
chang , you &apos;re insane . you &apos;re still into keytar ?
we &apos;re going to tell the board what you did !
we &apos;re going to tell the board what you--
you think they &apos;ll believe the greendale seven and the worst dean ever
over the guy who just nailed an awesome solo ?
you &apos;re going to burn down the school and kill everyone !
fire can &apos;t go through doors , stupid .
it &apos;s not a ghost .
i know this is a bit of a long shot ,
but i don &apos;t suppose any of you paid my rent ?
thank you , everyone , for joining in my celebration .
as many of you know , i ate my twin sister in utero .
so on my birthday , i try to remember
i &apos;m a winner .
this one &apos;s for you , connie .
and a @-@ one , a @-@ two , a chang , chang , chang @-@ four .
we &apos;re all going to die .
we have to get out of here .
how ?
it &apos;s a miracle .
what ?
yes ! let &apos;s get out of here !
no , troy , you didn &apos;t--
there &apos;s no time . we gotta go .
six guards , two on scooters .
chang started his solo .
knowing him , that gives us only nine minutes
to get to the records room .
we &apos;ll need a distraction .
you heard the lady .
take your tops off .
i might have something .
to supplement greendale &apos;s budget ,
i &apos;ve been renting the school out for raves on the weekend .
they call it &quot; academania . &quot;
it &apos;s mostly hard house , some--some dubstep ,
but totally--
perfect .
troy and abed , you make a run for it .
dean , i think it &apos;s time to party .
hey , what the freak ?
what &apos;s going on ?
no ! no ! no !
you weigh nothing !
i can &apos;t see them .
they &apos;re too many of them .
which wire do i cut ?
there &apos;s only one .
god , i hope i &apos;m right .
study group !
you did it ! so we &apos;re done , right ?
we &apos;re done ? done , done , done ?
not done .
you foiled me for the last time .
so , it ends as it began .
it didn &apos;t begin this way .
what the hell &apos;s going on in here ?
hey , fellas .
i just caught the greendale seven
trying to burn down the school .
i &apos;m a hero . how about that cake ?
he &apos;s lying . he kidnapped the dean .
yeah , we gathered that much when we found
these two slap @-@ fighting in the hallway .
you stole my life !
it is hard out there for a fake moby !
carl , richie , let me ex @-@ chang .
i &apos;m not getting paid , am i ?
so a madman in a napoleon costume
ran the school into the ground and almost blew it up ?
yeah . and on our watch .
what happened to us ?
well , i have a drinking problem .
we &apos;re going to get fired .
only a matter of time
until everyone finds out what happened here .
nobody can sit on something this big .
i &apos;ll sit on it .
when i became dean , i made a pledge
to swallow this school &apos;s failures
and spit out degrees
because that &apos;s what deans do .
you &apos;d do that for us ?
no .
i do it for greendale .
it &apos;s great to have you back , craig .
it &apos;s almost as if you were never unknowingly gone .
yard margs at &apos; sskeeper &apos;s . -
perfect . i left my credit card there .
thanks , craig .
you guys saved me .
i don &apos;t know how i will ever repay you .
you already have .
troy , you don &apos;t have to do this .
the a.c. school has no claim on your soul .
no , but i do .
a man &apos;s only as good as his word ,
or his nod through a camera to a guy with a button .
it &apos;s time . say your good @-@ byes .
shirley , never change .
or do , if you want , i &apos;m not your boss .
oh , honey .
never wear a rubber .
never listen to pierce .
whenever you finally finish that jigsaw puzzle ...
will you tell me what kind of boat is at the end of that dock ?
this is a lock of my hair .
creep .
all right , let &apos;s go .
abed ?
what did he say to you ?
he said , &quot; i know you hate when people do this in movies . &quot;
sorry i got emotional .
troy barnes .
welcome home .
i &apos;m really digging this hard house !
it &apos;s quite a groove .
this is my school !
it &apos;s called greendale ,
and i &apos;m the dean of the entire school .
i mean , i wasn &apos;t for a while , but it &apos;s a long story .
you guys , everybody ,
you should come by during the day sometime .
it &apos;s totally different .
really , stop by . it &apos;ll blow your minds .
you can meet my best friend jeffery .
sure , i &apos;ll take a back rub , who &apos;s asking ?
