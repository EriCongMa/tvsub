it &apos;s always on the news .
&quot; a man is being held up at gunpoint . &quot;
&quot; tourists are terrorized at gunpoint . &quot;

i should go .
unless

unless you wanna stay over .
i mean , i &apos;m going to . so ....
yeah , i &apos;d really like that .
before we get into any staying @-@ over stuff ...
... there &apos;s something you should know .
is this , like , &quot; i have an early class tomorrow ... &quot;
... or &quot; i &apos;m secretly married to a goat &quot; ?
well , it &apos;s somewhere in between .
