You guys speak English?
Not some too much.
I just wanna say
it's been a while since we opened the books
and in regards to you guys
Burt Gerry
as a man of few words I...
Not few enough though huh? New blood.
New blood.
Salut.
Sure we break some balls here tonight
but I go way back.
And in light of recent humiliations
it's a honor to be joined by men
and not faggot-ass corn-holing cocksuckers
like married my cousin.
He should fuckin' die!
Phil relax.
Whoa whoa whoa Phil.
Take it easy.
Phil you know the wine makes you emotional.
Because I got an empty fuckin' stomach.
So have a breadstick.
45 minutes for some grilled eggplant?
Jesus Christ is there nothing without this complaining?
You didn't notice? Artie's game is a little off lately.
Well Carmela sent her branzino back Sunday night
but she loves to do that.
Gentlemen how's everything so far?
Fantastic.
Delicious.
The delay a thousand pardons.
I'm breaking in a new guy on the line.
You seem set for antipasto.
I gotta be honest new guy in the kitchen aside
I mean how come we're waiting? It seems empty out there.
People like to get in that last barbecue.
Artie you been to this "Da Giovanni" up by Troy Hills?
No I haven't been.
Supposed to be incredible.
He's a kid right?
I hate fish
but his with the agrodolce...
I'll check it out.
Ah buon appetito.
About time.
Fuckin' Phil. Some display huh?
Paid a visit to Vito's goomar Jill.
She still hasn't heard from Vito.
We were just discussin' "La Cage aux Fat."
I was gonna get my cousin Tommy to call his detective friend.
I've been hamstrung with that work stoppage at the office park.
Vito shows up he shows up then we deal with him. If not...
It's just a phone call. And seriously
Tommy says the guy can track somebody from the corn in his shit.
Yeah I saw them do that on "CSI."
Good night.
Bye Sack.
Bye now.
Good night kid.
Hey I was glad to hear you say that about the search
'cause I gotta take a little time off for some business in Cali.
Little Carmine's lined up a meet in L.A. for us.
So what is it business or time off?
Time off from here but definite business.
With Ben Kingsley Ton'.
So you're gonna go get an autograph
on the weekend of the Notre Dame-Michigan game?
I got my guys all over it. Little Carmine says
if we attach Ben Kingsley the picture's a go.
Little Carmine?
It's common knowledge the guy's retarded.
I don't get it. You agreed to this in the hospital.
Christopher I was in a coma.
Okay fine. I'll call Little Carmine
call the airline cancel.
I'll probably still reach someone.
What am I gonna do with you?
Make a lot of money.
All right.
What the fuck is this idiot doing?
No speak English.
...Brooklyn.
Ho pal. Move your car. We're late.
Move el automobile.
Rusty! Don't forget to call Marissa.
Hurry up. Let me see.
Museum...
Eastern Parkway.
Eastern Parkway not the Belt Parkway.
So I'm trying to eject the DVD and the kids are freaking
"What's wrong with that lady Daddy?"
And Carrie says---How's the scaloppine?
Uh it's delicious.
Thanks.
It all depends on slicing the veal very thin.
My way
I like to chill it down a degree or two
and then I pull a straight razor right across it.
Your father could cook.
He told me when you were in here last. 75th birthday right?
In the navy.
What's that?
In the navy he cooked.
Terrific guy. Great head of hair.
You enjoy.
Mmm.
Save room. I'll be back with dessert specials.
Ho Benny Moe and Jack.
How's the bruschett'?
You got a quorum. Let me get you a table.
You guys go ahead. I'm gonna stay right here.
My best customer but he's nailed to this fuckin' spot.
It's either the wine or the view.
Such a sweet kid.
You know she told Charmaine that back in Albania
her whole family got blown up
waiting on line for an oil change.
The shit she's been through we just had to help.
I even called in a favor with my cousin in Manhattan
got her a working visa started on the green card.
Martina come do some hosting.
Hi.
Hi.
What's up?
This is your cheering section over here.
Hello Benny.
You got the reservations squared away?
It's very few right now.
Football season.
I could watch her walk away all night.
Good 'cause like most girls with you that's what she's gonna do.
Ah to be young and single again like these two
huh Benito?
Ahh.
I can put the credit card numbers on actual plastic
for an extra five bills.
We do Internet strictly.
Mmm the gnocchi!
I'll take your word. It's a little too rich for my stomach.
It's okay. Just a bite.
I think it's a lamb ragu with just a scoop of cold rigott'.
Holy shit.
It's all so fresh. That fish with pistachios?
I feel like a traitor.
Vesuvio lately it's depressing somehow.
Maybe they need to remodel or something. I don't know.
That menu is so tired.
Hey Homo Junior!
Leave me the fuck alone!
Get stop it!
Mom they're hurting Vito!
Stop it!
Where are your parents?
I guess she can't hide her face at home.
It'd be like admitting there was something wrong.
I should have brought a pair of sweatpants
to change into. I'm gonna explode.
Apparently there is still a veal loin
yet to be unveiled.
Please don't get up.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
That kid I'm tellin' you...
Thank you.
he was so handsome in that church.
The name he took "Francis" after my pop.
No restaurants in Brooklyn? You gotta come all the way to Jersey?
This food it's worth a detour. Why? ls there a problem?
Artie's a friend of mine you know? I like to throw him some business.
Talk to you a minute?
Visited with John.
He said to tell you he appreciates the recent headlines.
Rusty
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I turned him down on that.
Madonn' you're a cautious man.
You know some people might feel a little offended.
Me my heart is an open book.
Anyway Rusty's gone
and we'll chalk it up to the headless horseman.
Giovanni.
Bravo!
Martina was just tellin' me
that in Montenegro I'd be the tallest guy.
Another fun fact from the Balkans.
Ben are you up for dessert?
No I'm all set here. Thanks.
Martina sweetheart
can I talk to you for a second?
What is it Artie?
You're looking at me very serious.
You remember I had that friend in Manhattan
that was gonna help speed you through the green card process?
Apparently it's not happening.
Why?
Too much on his plate he said.
I guess you're just gonna have to do it yourself. I'm sorry.
All those forms. Shit me.
I wish I could help you but really
it's a small inconvenience compared to living in freedom right?
Yes I know this.
Get him another 'buca.
Hey Tony.
You could fuck her you know?
Well...
I'm not 100% in that department
but I'm startin' to feel the old pressure.
It's funny 'cause guys like me we come here
we get drunk and stare.
Best-case scenario we go in the back room we get a lap dance
a dry hump and pfft blow in our pants.
Listen you wanna fuck her so bad I'm sure it could be worked out.
Nah I couldn't.
But you...
Well what do you want me to say?
Nothing. It's just a fact.
If I knew you were gonna be in such a pissy mood
Gabriella Dante and Rosalie Aprile came in for lunch yesterday.
So what you wanna fuck one of them now?
No.
Gab said you all went and had a meal at Da Giovanni on Sunday.
Well I was gonna tell you.
It was Phil's grandson's confirmation. It's a pain in the ass.
What are you gonna do? You gotta eat.
It's nothing' special believe me.
Actually Carm got a little sick after. Too much oil she thought.
Gab said I should check it out
like I could learn something.
Well she runs her mouth that one.
Fuck her.
Carm got sick. Nice touch.
It was a business obligation Artie.
Uh-oh. Last time I heard that I had to call the fire department.
Well maybe you need another fresh start to fuck up.
I should go.
Oh come on come on.
No.
I'm sorry. Have another one come on.
Forget it.
I know where your heart is.
I gotta plan the menu for tomorrow.
Fasanella my old man's a meat guy.
He said that the restaurant business was like keeping an elephant.
It costs a fortune and sooner or later it shits on your head.
I miss him.
Hector had to trim three inches off the fiorentinas.
Great. We can't even get the good meat anymore.
Fucking Western Beef is leaving us for dead.
I wanted you to call their guy
but you were on the floor talking to the Cohens' mother-in-law.
You can't deal with the Western Beef guy yourself
my blushing flower?
It's not the same from me.
And Arthur
the chatting with the guests...
Again that's it.
It's not Hector or the meat or these assholes
that are always looking for the next hot thing. It's me.
Limit it to a quick visit at coffee.
People wanna talk to each other not you.
Really? You know better than New Jersey Zagat
"Arthur Bucco warm and convivial host"?
Yeah we're here right now.
Sure the broad strokes. Perfect.
Kingsley's agent says
we grab lunch tomorrow poolside.
That guy Jay?
Yeah I got him out of some trouble
on a party yacht down in the Keys.
Ben Kingsley can he do a New Jersey accent?
Welcome to the Viceroy.
I usually send the bags up hit the bar
decompress a little unless you're against it.
What are you talking about?
You're in AA.
You gave the stewardess an earful when she put down the champagne.
I just don't wanna make you feel uncomfortable.
Relax. I can deal with it.
Be careful with this wine
because the way you two are looking at each other
pretty soon we're gonna have to...
put a high chair right here.
Did you clip the daily-special cards to all the menus?
Hey Artie
come here.
You ready to order?
Why you kicking her ass like that?
If you're referring to the fact that she's my employee
and I'm telling her what to do last time I checked that's the way it works.
She thinks you want her to cry. I said not true.
She told you that?
'Cause you two talk all the time.
Yeah. So what?
So maybe you should hire her.
I know how to treat people.
You're a people person obviously.
I am.
And when they're good to me they get treats.
And when they're not well I got this severance thing I do.
It's a complete break actually.
I get it.
See 'cause you talked around that threat so much I almost missed it.
Sorry to interrupt you guys
but Arthur you have to plate the salmon.
Arthur the kid is a hood okay?
If he feels protective of his girlfriend
you should just leave it alone.
She's a slow learner.
She's a nice girl and as predicted
the customers love her
with her little stories from the old country.
You are just picking on her.
It's disgusting. He's a married man.
So it's 500 for the hour 300 for half.
And if you wanna keep skiing that's extra.
All right Eden how's about 400 for 40
and four more lines and then we'll take it from there?
That'll work.
Fuckin'-a.
Those are some amazing tits.
Thank you sweetie.
Carlo's running late. Route 23 they think there's a sniper.
Listen the other night
it's this place. You know the rope's
a little tight at my collar.
Down 40% from last year.
You need a little help?
From you? God no.
Oh there's the gratitude I was looking for.
No I mean I'm not at that point thank God.
But thank you.
Well listen the other day I was driving along
and I was thinking about your little problem.
How about a little promotion? A coupon two-for-one?
Two-fers wow.
You mean like you get a free spaghetti and meatballs
if you bring another cheap gomer douchebag in here?
How about an early-bird special? Salad wagon?
This is a fine dining establishment. I'll give it back to the bank
before I turn it into a fucking IHOP.
Just send the waiter over here.
You wanna help me so badly? Try paying your tab.
Excuse me?
That little roast you and the waste management people threw for Dick Barone
when he got sick
40 fucking garbagemen from around the country.
Of course you paid Pat Cooper.
You paid the entertainment.
Afternoon. We're looking for Arthur Bucco.
That's me.
Dave Kloski. This is Jim Hollings.
American Express? Funny I had you two for cops.
In a past life. Actually we're here to investigate
some recent irregularities in charge activity here at Nuevo Vesuvio.
"Nuovo." lrregularities?
Well there is credit card fraud going on in this restaurant.
That's impossible.
Based on cardholder disputes
we show nine hits in this locus that precede fraudulent activity.
What does that mean?
People's card numbers were copied
and those numbers were used to rack up thousands of dollars in phony charges.
Wait you think I'm ripping off my own customers? That's insane.
Were these meals actually served?
Shit.
Councilman Carillo? That was just two weeks ago.
So you understand we have to suspend
the use of our cards here pending an investigation.
Suspend? You're cutting me off?
What's going on?
They're from Amex. No more charges.
What?!
Someone's stealing!
Guys this is like 30% of my business here
and I can't fucking spare it right now!
Artie please don't curse. The minute you use profanity
you give them the high moral ground to do whatever they please.
We need copies of your reservations
and a list of anyone who has access to customer plastic.
I'm just asking Jay.
Well tell me again.
Why am I meeting with these chaps?
Oh! Oh bollocks Jay. Uh bollocks!
Oh please.
Anyway we appreciate that your time
is less than limited so I'll cut to the chase.
Log line "The Ring" meets "The Godfather."
Wiseguy--murdered I guess you could say
seeks revenge on the man who ordered it.
You would play that man.
Which man?
Who are we kidding here?
You're Ben Kingsley. You'd play the boss.
I heard this idea I call Jay and I say
"Sir Ben Kingsley no one else."
Well you know as ever it's script-dependent.
Oh we got a sensational writer JT Dolan.
I'm embarrassed. I haven't heard of him.
He's from TV "Nash Bridges " "Hooperman "
and "Law & Order the SUV."
So there's a script?
We wanted to surmise your interest
and then tailor the part to your specificities.
No one plays a tough ruthless hardhearted prick like you do.
You got it down trust me.
I take that as quite a compliment.
Sure. "Sexy Beast"?
Now we do have a shortlist of directors.
We could go A-list down the horror genre
Ridley Tobe Hooper.
Or we could try to find the next James Wan. He did "Saw."
Did you see that? Fuckin' brutal.
Betty?
It's Ben. How are you?
What on earth are you doing out here?
Oh I don't know.
Gentlemen allow me to introduce Miss Lauren Bacall.
Lauren this is Carmine Tazzi and Christopher...
Moltisanti. Huge fan.
Thank you.
"Lupertazzi."
You were great in "The Haves and Have-Nots."
Oh yes dear Howard Hawks. Thank you.
I'm a presenter at one of these award shows ShoWest
some bullshit.
Oh I did one of those years ago
after "Death and the Maiden "I think.
They do take good care of you though.
I have shiatsu in about 10 minutes.
Wow.
But let's catch up.
Absolutely. Great to see you.
Thank you.
As always.
So nice meeting both of you.
Enjoy your success.
Uh that reminds me I have a scheduling problem.
This meeting was last minute and I'm supposed to be
at the Luxury Lounge at 2:00.
Yeah but we haven't even gotten to the particulars yet.
We'll walk with you.
I think this is going very well.
You okay? You seem a bit distracted.
It's fucking Sir Ben Kingsley is all. Lauren Bacall.
Yo.
Murmur I'm chipping here major.
Get on a plane.
Sir Ben Kingsley and... guests.
Janine will take you around.
Hi Janine. Ben Kingsley.
We're offering the full services
of the spa today including massage.
Listen we're thinking about Sam Rockwell for the younger guy.
ls that a good chemistry for you?
Hmm.
May I offer you champagne?
Maybe later.
This is Yael from Cosabella Lingerie. Sir Ben Kingsley.
I'll take an extra large in these.
For a man White & Warm is giving this cashmere throw
great for the airplane and here one for the car.
Thanks Yael.
They charge this shit to the room?
Hmm?
This is Carla from Oris.
Men's and women's sporty and dressy.
A lot of guys are going with the classic stainless chrono.
Oh my godson would love that. He's having his birthday in three weeks.
But for me...
This is elegant.
Really is.
Take the chrono too?
Are you sure?
Of course.
ls all this shit free?
I'm gettin' that.
Pam has a huge crush on you.
Thanks Pam.
So Kingsley they do this all the time?
It's Sir Ben actually.
Sorry.
A couple of times a year mainly clustered around award seasons.
How is that even fuckin' possible?
I know. It's embarrassing isn't it?
I know I have one of these.
Shelly from iRiver.
I don't know if you have this one.
It's got 20 gigs of space in a tiny package.
That's 80 hours of video or 600 hours of music.
Shelly can I get one of these?
Here you go Sir Ben.
Thank you Shelly.
Sir Ben you've got a meeting with Doug in 10 so...
Hey guys
looks like I ate up all our time here.
What do you say we catch up in New York?
You got a lot of tables left.
We're gonna make that work Sir Ben.
They're giving away a Caddy over there!
Well no it's just a test-drive for a couple of weeks.
You know my family gave me some sunglasses for Christmas
so why don't you have these?
I bet they'll look great on you Chris.
I don't know. You think?
Sir Ben can we get a shot?
The thing the Arabs.
Chris wanted me to take care of you while he's away.
This is one week?
Yeah Murmur caught some big ones.
You're going to see your girlfriend over at Vesuvio?
Yeah.
All right.
Uh...
Give this to Artie. Put it on my tab.
We're not here to accuse anybody
'cause Mainie and I like to think of you all as family.
And this is very serious.
It is but know that as family
you'll be treated with respect
and if need be forgiveness.
Hector and you mustache...
You got something to say?
We have no intention of pressing charges. It's just gotta stop.
That's all we want. Any questions?
Understand this is not about a 42-oz. jar of Moroccan olives
or a couple of rolls of toilet paper here.
This is our livelihoods.
Are you looking at me?
Nobody's looking at anybody.
I didn't take the toilet paper.
But the olives?
I'm joking here.
I'm just saying if you don't come clean to us
those investigators
well they just might question the honesty
of somebody that wears a coat
pulled from the lost-and-found. -Fuck this!
No fuck you!
Arthur
I don't know which one of you pieces of shit did this
but I've been good to you!
getting us nowhere.
And you pay me back with nonstop ass-rape!
Well fuck all a' you!
You know what? Just forget it.
I I'm so sorry everybody.
Um could you just get this cleaned up so we can open? Thanks.
No no. It's very bad.
They had the credit card police.
Those companies are huge.
They come on tough but in the end they gotta eat it.
Okay.
Everything okay in there?
For once I'd like to eat without you getting a call from work.
Ah.
God damn it.
Arthur!
What do you want a repeat performance of the Fourth of July?
That cop told you
no firing guns in the borough limits.
I brought those arugula seeds
all the way back from Italy in my shaving kit.
Eden get the fuck out of there!
Fuck off.
I wasn't going through your purse!
I was movin' it and it fell.
Go fuck yourself you guinea bastard!
Good afternoon Mr. Moltisanti.
Room 812 please.
Yes.
Hey Sir Kingsley.
It's Chris Moltisanti from yesterday?
I spoke with Jay
and he's working on that New York meeting right now.
Fine but that's not what I'm calling about though.
That Luxury Lounge thing can you get me in there?
I don't know. My publicist handles all that stuff.
So can you call 'em?
I don't know
how my publicist can help you you know?
All right.
Yeah in the city then. My partner went back.
Friend of his died recently. Guy's wife
is having a breakdown. He'll call you.
That's security Eden! They're gonna blow that door open!
Fuck you!
Fuck.
I know I gotta get it together.
Black truffle doesn't have the intensity of white so you gotta use more.
I'll be at my investing club at the Learning Annex with my cell
if you have to call but try not to.
Sandy about the meeting...
Oh everybody knows you're upset.
I know.
But Alonzo's coat you told me that in confidence.
I thought you needed to know.
I also think well it's probably nothing
but yesterday Martina was showing off these Caovilla sandals.
I know she makes more than me
but they cost like $600.
You should get back to the coatroom.
Hold on a second. I wanna ask you something.
I knew it.
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back.
How could you do this to me?
You were so mean to me.
Like helping you find the apartment? Teaching you to drive?
As soon as you found out I wasn't going to fuck you you started picking on me.
I wanna fuck you? You certainly have a high opinion of yourself.
You stare at me like food.
Well I never fuck you.
I go to Benny and we laugh at you...
Benny.
when I fuck him in the pile of money
that we take from your stupid customers.
You're fired.
Oh yeah? Oh who's laughing now?
What do you think? I can't press charges 'cause of my friendship with Tony?!
Three months you worked here!
You think that doesn't go on your permanent record?!
We lead the world in computerized data collection!
Artie you know what time it is?
We need to talk.
Now?
My wife is pregnant. She needs to sleep.
Martina told me about your little credit card business.
Step outside Ben.
I'll be outside a minute honey.
Look.
You're upset all right?
But it's not my fault that little trick got greedy.
Oh so she's a little trick huh?
I was gonna cut you in but now you're acting stupid.
Regular people are all fucking stupid.
You want some more?!
Piece of dogshit! Little crazy
motherfucking meatball dogshit!
Yeah I'm stupid.
Ho! There he is.
How you doing?
Great thanks.
This is Murmur.
You heading to the pool?
Massage.
Oh.
Listen. You get a chance to call about that Luxury Lounge for me?
Well it's like I explained...
there's nothing very much I can do about it.
They decide whom they give it to.
Very important people
like you right? 'Cause you're a very important person.
To them I guess.
Murmur's an interesting name. What's the genesis?
I had a heart murmur when I was a kid.
They just keep handing stuff out huh?
The coolest shit in the world
to the people who need it the least.
Look. I think you've misunderstood something.
I give most of that stuff away
to homeless shelters the rest I give to charity auctions.
Not to your godson?
I agree with you
the whole thing's obscene and it's nothing
compared to the situation at award shows.
Presenters get
about $30.000 worth of merchandise in those baskets.
That's a year's salary for some people.
Go figure.
Hopefully we can spread some of that lolly around.
We'll get you that script.
Hell of a tub here guys.
Sea sun. I'm gonna make it my second home.
Anybody else hungry? Huh?
We'll get lunch started.
Artie another margarita?
I could say no but I won't.
You lost your fucking mind?
The shit you're in with that kid which you brought on yourself.
Brought on myself?
Oh I suppose you let a certain element into your world you're asking for it.
Oh!
Jesus fucking Christ Tony
how could you pull that scam at my place?
Come on
you know I never would've let that happen if I'd known.
You're innocent I get it.
I'm just another victim of Benny Fazio criminal mastermind.
That's right.
And once you found out instead of putting him in the E. R.
you should've come to me. He says he's gonna kill you Artie.
I can't take American Express now Ton'.
You know what that means? I have to start with the fucking two-fers.
My accountant insisted. Are you happy?
Life's not fair. Right I know.
But somehow I believed my dad's crap about honest work.
He used to say to me "You'll see.
Pays off in the end."
What a joke.
I hate to see you like this you know that.
'Cause you start thinking crazy shit.
Who's hungry?
Yeah?
Ben Kingsley passed.
Fuck.
You know I tried to be his friend
I sent a muffin basket with the script
I tried everything.
You can kill me after if you want
but he's a fucking dead man.
Calm down Ben.
He came to my house Tony where my wife was watching TV.
My wife who's carrying my unborn son.
I'm gonna take him to that warehouse in Paterson
and drive fucking...
Nails into his balls. I know.
I heard you the first time.
You're having a son huh?
They showed us his cannoli
on the ultrasound like a month ago.
That's beautiful.
Oh congratulations.
Thank you.
I'm gonna tell you this once
it's over. You drop it.
And frankly you should be very happy I'm not gonna tax you.
I mean beside the fact you know I grew up with the man
you don't shit where you eat.
And you really don't shit where I eat.
I know and I'm sorry about that but
And your parents' anniversary party?
It's not going to be at Da Giovanni's. It's gonna be at Vesuvio.
What? Tony look at my face.
He's going to apologize to you and give you a rate.
He's hurtin' too. And it's the least you can do.
Well Ms. Bacall your limo is second in line there.
Oh well I can take it from here.
You sure?
Yeah thank you so much.
Okay you're welcome.
Good night.
Night.
Get the fuck away from me!
What are you doing?!
Somebody help us!
Those guys!
Ms. Bacall don't move.
Yes an ambulance by Robinsons-May.
Oh Jesus my fucking arm.
Hmm?
No.
There's a line outside.
Okay push the scampi. Wholesaler says they gotta get eaten tonight.
And don't spread out too much. We still got the Fazio party in the banquet room.
Okay Sandy. Open the door.
Hello. Welcome.
Do you have low-salt selections?
Ma Pop order whatever you want.
I'm having that loin of veal.
That's the other place Ma.
This the young couple?
Yes my mom and dad.
Cent'anni!
Hundred years!
Cent'anni!
Well I hope you all enjoy. You're all set for wine cocktails?
Nothing?
Fine thanks.
Benny can I get you a Martina?
Excuse me?
A Martina.
It's like a Martini but it's from Albania.
Hmm. I never heard of it.
Well apparently they go down real easy.
Right Ben?
We're gonna look at the menu.
Good enough.
You order for me.
Fine. The monkfish.
There's such a strange consistency.
Ow!
In front of my wife?!
Fuck!
Jesus! Fuck my hand!
Shit! Oh God! Oh fuck!
Fuck! My hand!
Oh my God! Oh my God!
Oh my God Arthur! Somebody call 911 please!
Look at this.
I had no idea. I'd have booked another flight.
Fuck.
Where is everybody?
My father-in-law don't wanna come.
Him and Carm aren't speaking.
How's the meathook?
Had to be my fuckin' saute hand huh?
Why you got an okay crowd here today.
Sunday pasta's the last thing to go.
The place is on life-support ever since word got out
to the regulars about their credit cards.
And my staff is pissed off about Martina leaving.
Benny did a real number here Tony.
Who knows? Maybe it's cursed. The fire then this.
Will you stop talkin' like an old lady?
Artie.
No go huh?
He's just being dramatic.
How are you sweetie?
Better.
And Carm the flowers...
Tonight only the best
for the best people.
Hmm that's excellent.
Hey be careful you two
because the way you two are looking at each other
pretty soon we'll have to put a high chair over here.
Like the icing on a cake okay? Capisce?
Keep your thumbs out of the food.
We gotta talk about your problem.
Oh great. Another idea.
How 'bout a strolling accordionist?
I'm gonna give you the name of a good psychiatrist.
She's Italian. You'll like her.
You know what? You go about in pity for yourself.
I go about in pity for myself?
Yeah.
I gotta tell you Bodhisattva
that is fucking priceless.
Use the other door.
You bitch and you moan and you blame
everybody else for your problems
instead of maybe... not letting the Mexicans do all the cooking for you
or I don't know changing the menu or changing the decor.
I guess because you know how to eat you know how to run a restaurant.
On one of the bleakest nights of my life
after the shit with my mother and that fuckin' storm outside
I came here to this place.
I sat out there with Carm and my two kids
and we ate and we drank and we were so happy to be here
more than any other place in the world.
And you know I'm gonna eat here until I fall off the chair.
But in business sometimes shit happens.
The playing field changes whatever.
And you gotta do whatever you gotta do to keep your dick up.
If you hate it here so much why don't you go to Da Giovanni?
See if he'll cook you that bland shit for your shot-up pancreas.
I'll tell you one thing
and this is very hard...
nobody wants to hear you talk.
They're trying to eat out there and you come along
with your corny jokes and your stupid stories.
Just stay in the kitchen.
That'd be a start.
Hey.
You wouldn't believe what these people in the business get
totally fuckin' absolutely gratis.
Yeah I hear the streets are paved with hand jobs.
Right. I scored some major swag.
A little taste for you.
Trip to Australia first-class vouchers
some kind of golf resort.
Looks like Sarasota.
After what a 20-hour flight? No.
That's for a pocket dog.
How'd it go with the movie star?
He was all over us but I don't think he's right.
We made some great contacts. Plus we saw Lindsay Lohan.
Total piece of ass.
You hear Artie burned his hand?
Yeah. Him and Benny. How crazy is that?
He okay?
A layer of skin
came off his hand like a glove.
But they said you know no scarring no grafts.
Lucky.
Hmm.
Well not for nothin'. I couldn't help but thinkin'
if you were here watching your crew
things wouldn't have gone the way they did.
You let me go T.
I asked you. Now it's my fault Artie and Benny got into it?
This is what I was concerned about Christopher the loss of focus.
Look...
not many guys have had to make the kind of sacrifice I did.
How many times you gonna play the Adriana card?
Sandy just seated a couple.
Kitchen's closed.
He said they were supposed to go to the city but they had car trouble.
Hector already left to pick up his wife.
Plus I got nothing back here Charm.
They already opened the bottle.
They're gonna have to eat what I give them.
Arthur a lot of people don't like rabbit.
Only with Proven膯搂al elements I been thinking about. My grandfather's way.
I thought you were taking it to him at the home.
