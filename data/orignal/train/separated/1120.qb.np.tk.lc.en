i want to finish what i started to tell you at homecoming .
is that ian ?
does melissa know he &apos;s back ?
i don &apos;t know why she ever broke up with him .
she didn &apos;t . he broke up with her .
hanna , we have to make some adjustments .
this is a one @-@ paycheck family .
we can no longer live a two @-@ paycheck life .
this is noel kahn .
he was your biggest crush
all through middle school ,
and now he &apos;s asked you out .
dad , this is my friend maya .
really happy to meet you .
&quot; alison loves ian &quot; ?
i was wrong .
hanna !
hanna !
there &apos;s been an accident ! please hurry !
&quot; she knew too much . a. &quot;
somebody ! help !
miss marin .
oh , hello , barry .
something wrong ?
i &apos;m afraid so .
it just came over the radio .
i &apos;m sorry ,
but your daughter &apos;s been involved in an accident .
is that hanna ?
we have to get to the hospital . are you guys okay to drive ?
yeah , i guess so .
okay .
hanna &apos;s mom is with the doctor .
i &apos;m okay .
i didn &apos;t know who was driving the car .
we were at mona &apos;s party ,
and hanna got a text .
so we were going to the parking lot to meet her ,
and that &apos;s when she got hit .
she was unconscious .
we couldn &apos;t talk to her .
that &apos;s why we want to wait--
maybe they &apos;ll let us see her or something .
um , let me call you back when i know something .
bye , alex .
is she okay , mrs. marin ?
she is going to be all right .
she , uh ...
she has a broken leg and a broken ankle ,
bruised ribs ,
and they might have to remove her spleen .
what happened ?
hanna was coming across the parking lot ,
and this car just came out of nowhere .
well , the police found the car .
they said it was stolen from a campground lot .
did they catch the driver ?
no , not yet .
well , the cops should be looking for toby cavanaugh .
it wasn &apos;t toby cavanaugh .
the police picked him up last night .
what ?
one of the officers told me they found him hiding in town ,
and they were bringing him in to the station
when they got the call about hanna .
you girls should go home .
i will call you when hanna can have visitors .
just let hanna know that we were here .
i will ... when she wakes up .
toby isn &apos;t &quot; a. &quot;
well , hanna knows who is .
that &apos;s why &quot; a &quot; tried to kill her .
you think they &apos;re just trying to scare us ?
well , it worked .
this was never about scaring us ,
that was just a bonus .
this started with murder--
we were crazy to think that it wouldn &apos;t end up like this .
so should we tell the cops ?
tell them what ?
everything .
we don &apos;t know everything .
so what do we do ?
well , we talk to hanna before we do anything .
is hanna safe here ?
yeah .
i mean , nothing will happen to her
while her mom is with her .
mom said you called .
are you all right ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m okay .
what happened ?
a car hit hanna .
a car ?
who was driving ?
we don &apos;t know .
they didn &apos;t stop ?
no , they just--
they just knocked her down and drove away .
oh , god .
is she okay ?
she &apos;s just shaken up .
no , i mean hanna .
yeah . yeah , her mom said she was gonna be all right .
good .
heads up , spence ,
i &apos;m canceling monday &apos;s practice .
i &apos;ll be out in a minute , ian .
okay .
he stayed the night ?
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re strangers .
we went out for two years , and we had a lot to talk about .
go upstairs . get some sleep , okay ?
okay .
when they find the maniac who did this to you ,
i will kill him .
after i kill him , i will sue him .
have you seen aria or spencer or emily ?
yeah , there were all here .
i sent them home .
sean was here , too ,
and a boy named lucas .
who is he exactly ?
he works on the yearbook with me .
i need to call spencer .
they have to come back .
that can wait .
no . no , mom , it can &apos;t .
i will call them . you relax .
i didn &apos;t see it till i came down this morning .
maybe somebody put it there after you parked .
aria , we both know when this happened .
this happened last night .
i don &apos;t know that , and neither do you .
&quot; i see you . &quot;
not &quot; wash me . &quot; not &quot; go sharks . &quot;
&quot; i see you . &quot; that &apos;s very specific .
maybe it &apos;s specific , but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
aria , it means somebody saw us last night .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
here you go .
thank you . mm @-@ hmm .
i really don &apos;t want anything .
you need to eat some breakfast .
i don &apos;t want you driving
back to the hospital if you &apos;re stressed out .
give ben a call , see if he &apos;ll give you a lift .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
ben and i are sort of really over .
you know , everyone in this town feels a lot safer
with toby cavanaugh locked up .
what happened to innocent until proven guilty ?
guilty or not , he &apos;s better with the police
than wandering around on his own .
there &apos;s always more to a story than people think .
not at the table .
it might be about hanna .
it &apos;s all right .
does it hurt ?
yeah , kind of .
do you remember what happened ?
uh , yeah , i remember .
um , mom , you &apos;ve been here the whole time , too .
you wanna take a break ?
are you sure ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
noel kahn is &quot; a &quot;
what ? are you serious ?
yeah , i saw him in the woods ,
and he left an &quot; a &quot; message .
you saw him leave a message ?
he wrote something on the back of a car window .
what car ? what did he write ?
&quot; i see you . &quot;
how do you know ?
i was in the car .
whose car was it ?
ezra fitz .
mr. fitz ?
aria .
hanna ?
it was mr. fitz .
you and mr. fitz ?
you met him there ?
the call you got at the party-- that was from him ?
i couldn &apos;t tell .
i couldn &apos;t tell anyone .
i promised ezra .
ezra ? whoa , hold it .
this is something that &apos;s been going on ?
you and a teacher ?
i didn &apos;t just get into his car last night .
who do you think i am ?
how long have you been seeing him ?
since right before school started .
oh , my god , since labor day ? !
okay , so you don &apos;t have a boyfriend in iceland ?
no , i did .
yeah , but it &apos;s not like that .
you were seeing a teacher
when i fixed you up with noel ?
oh , my god , i fixed you up with noel .
and why did you get in his car last night ?
well , he , um , called me and--
oh , don &apos;t look at me like that .
my head hurts just as much as my leg now .
what exactly did you see ?
well , i saw aria go into a parked car ,
and then i saw someone in a black hoodie
write something on the back of the car window ,
and when he turned around ,
it was noel .
no , it can &apos;t be noel .
aria , i saw what i saw .
and &quot; a &quot; tried to kill her for it .
okay , but none of us saw
who was driving the car .
if that &apos;s someone with painkillers ,
just let them in .
noel .
i just heard about hanna .
thought i &apos;d try to visit .
she just fell asleep .
we &apos;re getting ready to leave .
what happened ?
don &apos;t you know ?
i heard it was a hit @-@ and @-@ run .
who told you that ?
sean .
is she gonna be okay ?
yeah , we hope so .
this is insane .
yeah , you &apos;re right about that .
well , i &apos;ll take this in for you .
we need to talk .
i know .
you &apos;ll call me ?
sure , yeah .
noel .
where were you last night ?
hanging with sean . why ?
um , no , i was just wondering .
he lied to me ...
about being there .
he said he was with sean .
this house isn &apos;t gonna clean itself .
this house looks fine to me .
the water heater &apos;s on its last leg .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
i &apos;m sorry .
about what ?
you come home ,
and all i do is rattle off a list of things that are broken .
it &apos;s all right .
it makes me feel needed .
oh , you &apos;re needed .
how long ?
not sure .
they want me to supervise some training exercises ,
but they haven &apos;t set a schedule yet .
where do you have to go ?
texas .
it &apos;s only one time zone away .
it &apos;s just so much better when you &apos;re here ,
for me and emily .
it &apos;s just better for her with the whole team , you know ?
i know .
you &apos;re doing great , though .
honey , so much has happened to her .
what do you mean ?
this business about the cavanaugh kid ?
well , yeah , that , and alison .
she &apos;s just really confused right now .
confused how ?
oh , honey , daughters don &apos;t talk to their mothers
the way they talk to their dads .
you need her to tell you something , you ask her .
she &apos;ll tell you the truth .
i gotta finish .
oh , my god , mona .
i &apos;m waving a white la perla .
that &apos;s like the international peace symbol .
can i come in ?
come in .
oh , that cast ! that &apos;s--
that &apos;s like for a broken leg .
that won &apos;t keep you from wearing heels , will it ?
just for a little bit .
if i hadn &apos;t uninvited you to my party ,
then you wouldn &apos;t have felt so desperate that you had
to sneak around the edges and get hit by that car .
i almost feel guilty .
mona , you don &apos;t have anything to feel guilty for .
oh , good .
can we go back to being friends ?
the past is forgotten .
friends forever .
what ?
you just look sort of ... vague .
oh , um , i don &apos;t have any makeup on .
i can fix that .
oh , i &apos;m glad we &apos;re friends again .
i promise never to listen to another rumor
unless i start it myself .
do you remember that time you threw up on the trampoline ?
you did that back @-@ flip , and you barfed as you went over .
trust me , i remember .
well , the thing i remember was your dismount .
you knew everybody was staring at you .
you got to the edge , climbed down , and looked at us .
you wiped your mouth , and then you took a bow .
i was in awe .
of me hurling on the trampoline ?
no , of that bow .
i mean , it was like this incredible life lesson .
that &apos;s when i knew i wanted to be your friend .
wow , i never knew that .
because i never told you .
ah , concealer-- the true miracle drug .
are you sure about what you saw on that tree ?
we both saw it , aria .
well , i know , but ...
do you think that maybe ali just put it up there
to see what it might look like ?
no , ali may have done some psycho things ,
but she would never do anything tacky .
anyway , ian was with melissa last night ,
so he couldn &apos;t be &quot; a , &quot;
which brings us back to noel .
he had means . he had opportunity .
those pictures of emily
and maya were stolen at noel &apos;s party , right ?
yeah , i know .
and hanna saw him write
that message on the back of mr . fitz &apos;s car .
no , just slow down .
you flipped over to noel awful fast .
just 12 hours ago , you were so sure that it was toby .
what happened to that theory ?
&quot; a &quot; or not , you still need to know what noel saw ...
and what he plans to do about it .
i &apos;m sorry , visiting hours were over two hours ago .
you can come in the morning .
hey .
you all right ?
yeah . they adjusted my meds . i &apos;m just getting used to them .
who sent the orchids ?
sean brought them this morning .
very nice .
mom , i don &apos;t have to be in a private room .
i can move . we can save a couple bucks .
you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
i &apos;m alone here all day with a mummified leg .
aside from wondering how i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom ,
i do nothing but worry .
the bank and i have reached an accommodation .
they &apos;re gonna give you a loan ?
sort of a professional courtesy--
something to help us get back on our feet .
it &apos;s very short term .
so we &apos;re gonna be okay ?
we &apos;re gonna be okay .
you concentrate on getting well , okay ?
you didn &apos;t call .
sorry .
it got late .
what &apos;s the word on hanna ?
she &apos;s better .
that &apos;s great .
did they catch the guy that did it ?
not yet .
the police are talking to everyone who was there
to see if anyone saw anything .
did you see anything ?
who told you i was at the campground ?
i saw you in the crowd
when they were putting hanna in the ambulance .
i wasn &apos;t sure then , but i &apos;m sure now .
it was you .
it was supposed to be a joke .
a joke ?
yeah , like a movie--
bunch of girls in the woods .
i went out there to give you guys a scare .
i saw you going off , so i followed you ...
followed you to his car .
you wrote on the window .
i should &apos;ve thrown a rock .
what did you see ?
enough to figure out why you act so squirrely around him .
what did he promise you to get you in that car ?
i &apos;ll go to the principal with you .
the principal ?
you can take this guy down for what he made you do .
noel ...
they can put him in jail .
noel , stop . it &apos;s not like that .
then what is it like ?
if you care about me at all ,
please don &apos;t say anything to anyone .
just let me handle it .
promise me .
i have to go .
noel , please . promise me .
all right .
i promise .
do you know when agent cooper will be back ?
it &apos;s about toby cavanaugh .
i want to know if he &apos;s allowed to have any visitors .
no , i &apos;m not family . i &apos;m a friend .
just have her call me back , please .
thank you .
he doesn &apos;t wanna see you .
and even if he did , i wouldn &apos;t let him .
he &apos;s been hurt , emily . you should be able to understand that .
i didn &apos;t tell the police where he was .
but look what you &apos;ve done .
you &apos;ve made him run away .
the police came to our house because of you .
they found that sweater because of you .
let me talk to him , please .
no . i &apos;m not gonna let anyone come between us again .
somebody should have come between you two a long time ago .
maybe a social worker with a bucket of ice water .
i can &apos;t imagine why everyone thinks you &apos;re the sweet one .
did you miss me ?
ali .
they said you were dead .
yeah , i heard that , too ,
but here i am .
what happened to you ?
it &apos;s complicated , hanna .
really complicated-- worse than algebra .
what happened when you left the barn ?
we all wanna know .
you already do--
the four of you combined .
you remember more about that night than you think you do .
where &apos;d you go ?
did you meet a boy ?
noel ?
noel ?
please .
please , just tell me the truth .
it won &apos;t make any difference , darling .
how can you say that ?
because i know .
you think the truth is
some big shiny disco ball of purity ?
then go ahead and try it .
be honest . see what it gets you .
telling the truth to the wrong person at the wrong time
is how i ended up where i am .
take it from me ,
you &apos;re always better off with a really good lie .
gotta go .
where ?
i was so scared that you were gonna die .
that &apos;s why i came back .
i didn &apos;t care how dangerous it was ,
i had to see you .
you know , i really should do something about &quot; a. &quot;
that bitch is genuinely getting on my nerves .
i was gonna look for you .
i think we need to talk .
yeah , uh , i &apos;m sorry about the car situation .
common sense kicked in about third period .
you &apos;re right .
somebody probably just doesn &apos;t like the way i park .
yeah , but you are right about there being other people .
we have to be really careful .
i &apos;ve been careful .
remember , careful made you unhappy .
you don &apos;t make me unhappy .
you totally mess me up ,
and i feel miserable sometimes ,
but you don &apos;t make unhappy .
i wasn &apos;t unhappy the other night .
but ?
but ...
would you go back if you could ?
if you knew that it would be this complicated ,
would you have even talked to me that first day in the bar ?
i &apos;ve thought about it .
if i had left before you walked in ,
we &apos;d have no problems .
you &apos;d just be a pretty
girl that sits one row over from the windows ,
and i &apos;d be the new teacher .
all neat and tidy .
is that what you want ?
to go back ?
no .
me neither .
so we don &apos;t go back .
we go forward ... together .
did you tell mr. fitz about noel ?
his name &apos;s ezra .
maybe you get to call him ezra ,
he &apos;s still mr. fitz to us .
did you tell him ?
no , i couldn &apos;t .
aria ...
well , how could i ?
well , what about you and noel ?
there isn &apos;t a &quot; me and noel . &quot;
there never really was .
does he know that ?
i think he does .
you think he does .
yeah , i just don &apos;t know how hard to push him ,
but i know that it &apos;s a one @-@ way street .
so once i say something to anybody ,
i can &apos;t take it back .
i know what you mean .
pudding @-@ cup @-@ aloosa .
vanilla , tapioca , butterscotch .
uh , tapioca .
i like the little bumps .
that &apos;s starting to look like the declaration of independence .
you know , lucas , you don &apos;t have to keep skipping school .
i &apos;m okay .
i told the office i was doing community service .
and they believed you ?
i have a very believable face .
i plan to use it in politics .
well , you &apos;re a good friend .
thanks .
you know , being friends with somebody ...
that can be more important sometimes
than getting to know them in a different way .
yeah , uh , i have to ask you something .
they have me on all kinds of drugs and things ,
and sometimes things can be a little ...
i don &apos;t know , um ...
the medical term for what you &apos;re looking for is &quot; loopy . &quot;
right , loopy .
i mean , i have like twilight zone moments--
funny dreams ,
just really unexpected stuff--
and it can be confusing .
&quot; did i just see that ? was that person really here ?
did i imagine that whole thing just happened ? &quot;
&quot; did lucas actually kiss me when he thought i was asleep ? &quot;
yeah , things like that .
i thought you might have been awake ,
and then i thought &quot; if she was awake
and she didn &apos;t scream , then that was a good sign . &quot;
well , i was too surprised to do anything .
really ? you were that surprised ?
me wanting to kiss you
was so outside the realm of probability ?
no . no , it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just ...
i thought that we were friends .
look , i like you , lucas .
i feel like you &apos;re breaking up with me ,
but we were never really together .
lucas , i am being honest with you ,
and besides , i have a boyfriend .
and i think you deserve a better boyfriend .
well , that &apos;s between me and sean .
look , i like you way too much to lie to you ,
and that &apos;s something i used to do all the time .
couldn &apos;t you just keep lying , just for old time &apos;s sake ?
i &apos;m sorry .
no , wait , lucas , you don &apos;t have to leave .
no , but if i stay , you &apos;re gonna think
that i &apos;m okay about this ,
and i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m just being honest .
i don &apos;t know , maya .
i mean , with hanna in the hospital ,
everything &apos;s on hold .
yeah .
i miss you , too .
maybe tomorrow ?
i gotta go .
right , bye .
was that hanna ?
no . maya .
does mom need help with dinner ?
no , not yet .
okay .
do you remember dennis small ?
yeah .
he told me that he heard you &apos;ve been calling the station ,
that you &apos;re trying to visit this toby cavanaugh .
do you wanna tell me why you &apos;re trying to talk to this boy ?
i want him to know that it wasn &apos;t me
who told the police where to find him .
has he threatened you in any way ?
no .
what is it ?
your mother thinks you &apos;re keeping some kind of secret .
you &apos;ve been jumpy since i got home .
at first , i thought it was
&apos;cause i hadn &apos;t been around , but that &apos;s not it .
something &apos;s eating you .
it &apos;s like you said , i &apos;m just a little jumpy .
you tell me who &apos;s giving you a hard time ,
and i will take care of it .
it &apos;s not like that .
if you need help , you ask for it .
there &apos;s nothing to be ashamed about .
dad ...
i &apos;m gonna talk to toby cavanaugh myself .
i &apos;m gonna put an end to it .
i &apos;m not afraid of toby .
you &apos;re afraid of something .
i can see it in your eyes .
now , what is it ?
i &apos;m afraid of you and mom .
why are you afraid of us ?
because i &apos;m not who you think i am .
you &apos;re emily fields , my little girl .
i &apos;d know you anywhere . i got a picture of you in my wallet .
i &apos;m eight years old in that picture .
that &apos;s a different girl .
it &apos;s the same girl .
we just need a new picture .
it &apos;s not that simple .
emily ...
i &apos;m gay .
i &apos;m gay .
a bar ? you met him in a bar ?
it &apos;s not a bar , it &apos;s a pub .
and he hit on you ?
yeah , we were talking about writing .
yeah , read any good books lately ?
hey , seriously .
boy , i &apos;ll tell you , part of me thinks
this is really self @-@ destructive behavior ,
but most of me just thinks it &apos;s really hot .
spence , don &apos;t tease , okay ?
it &apos;s not funny . it &apos;s the opposite of funny .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just ...
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m supposed to react to all of this .
yeah , neither do i.
show me the stupid tree , okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s right over here .
you are not gonna tell me ...
no , this was it . it was right here .
wait , are you sure that you have the right spot ?
i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s gone .
this isn &apos;t something she came up with on her own .
it &apos;s that girl from california--maya .
before we start talking about other people ,
let &apos;s just talk about emily .
why didn &apos;t she tell us ?
she was afraid .
of me ?
of both of us .
she &apos;s not afraid of us .
you wanna know what she &apos;s afraid of ?
this is what she &apos;s afraid of .
where &apos;d you get these ?
somebody mailed it to me--
someone who wanted me to know .
you had this , and you didn &apos;t tell me ?
when was i supposed to tell you ?
when you walked through the door
after being gone for eight months ?
is that how i &apos;m supposed to welcome you home ?
how are we gonna fix this ?
fix it ?
this is not like buying her braces .
it &apos;s who she is .
that &apos;s not who she is .
this is what someone else is making her into .
maybe she &apos;s just experimenting .
this is wrong .
this is completely wrong , and you know it .
do you think i like this ? i don &apos;t .
but when i went in there ,
i didn &apos;t know what she was gonna tell me .
i thought , sweet god , what is this ?
drugs ?
this toby kid get her pregnant ?
let &apos;s just keep this in perspective .
what is your perspective on right and wrong ?
she is struggling with this . i can see it .
and i can &apos;t ?
no , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
well , then what are you saying ?
are you willing to just turn away from everything we ever wanted for her ?
let her ruin her life so she can experiment ?
what happened to you ?
what happened to your values ?
did you just leave them out in the desert somewhere ?
i told you i don &apos;t like this .
but she is alive and healthy ,
and after everything i &apos;ve seen ,
alive and healthy counts for a lot , believe me .
we should call em and hanna .
we &apos;ll talk to them at the hospital .
a tree , spence , an entire tree .
i would &apos;ve settled for just cranberry juice .
oh , you found my stash .
should be cold enough , right ?
yeah .
well , you have great timing .
grab some glasses . melissa &apos;s out in the barn .
i &apos;d like to know what i &apos;m celebrating before i drink to it .
you don &apos;t have to be celebrating to drink champagne .
that &apos;s very old @-@ fashioned thinking .
you canceled practice today .
yes , i did .
to be with melissa ?
yes .
why ?
uh , you know , why don &apos;t you come out and talk to your sister ?
no . i think i &apos;d like to hear this from you .
we &apos;re married .
you &apos;re--you &apos;re what ?
we eloped .
yeah , it &apos;s incredible .
it &apos;s like last year never happened .
congratulations .
do--do mom and dad know ?
not yet .
yeah , we expect they &apos;ll be a little , um ... surprised .
surprised ?
this is what i want . they &apos;ll understand .
you &apos;ll help me with them .
i know i can count on you .
all right , uh , bring some glasses . we &apos;ll have a toast .
spence , what just happened ?
you told them ?
yeah .
how was that ?
rough .
hey , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s gonna be , but it &apos;s gonna be different .
i guess so .
so the whole tree ?
yeah , lock , stock , and bird &apos;s nest .
why ?
why show something like that and then just take it away ?
like &quot; a &quot; had a split personality .
that &apos;s great-- homicidal and nuts .
we &apos;ve been thinking maybe
we &apos;re dealing with more than one person .
&quot; a &quot; and ali &apos;s killer are two separate people ?
you are freaking out the invalid .
no , think about it .
no , you think about it .
aren &apos;t we in enough trouble ?
i know i am . just look at me .
hann . hann , who wrote this ?
i don &apos;t know .
people have been in and out all day , and so have i.
oh , no .
what ?
what ? what &apos;s on there ?
&quot; sorry about losing my temper . my bad . love , a. &quot;
who put that on my leg ?
who wrote that ?
did somebody come in here while you were asleep ?
i don &apos;t know . just get it off ! just wipe it off !
get off me .
