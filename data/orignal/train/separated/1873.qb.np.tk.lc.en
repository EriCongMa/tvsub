zola was our baby ,
and she &apos;s gone , and i don &apos;t want another baby .
you and i broke up .
you basically told me to wait for you .
what the hell happened ?
that &apos;s the screw that i just pulled out of her heart .
i supervised you inserting pedicle screws and a plate .
she &apos;s half dead .
dr. altman &apos;s repairing her heart right now .
so who &apos;s gonna be operating on me ?
cristina .
it &apos;s her mentor &apos;s husband .
cristina doesn &apos;t have to know that it &apos;s henry .
meredith and alex are trapped in an ambulance
in the middle of the highway .
we think they got hit .
they &apos;re sitting in a powder keg .
we gotta get outta here before this thing blows .
it &apos;s not right . if she finds out that i waited ,
she will never forgive me .
her husband just died in our o.r ..
she &apos;ll never forgive any of us .
victims of a sudden impact
are some of the hardest to treat .
it &apos;s not just the collision that injures them .
it &apos;s everything after .
the centrifugal force keeps them moving ,
tossing them from vehicles ,
throwing them through windshields ,
slamming their internal organs into the skeleton .
their bodies are injured over and over again .
so there &apos;s no way to know
how much damage has actually been done ...
until they stop .
sir ?
can you move ?
we need to get you off this road .
honey .
jessica .
answer me .
mom ?
mom .
mom , wake up .
mom , wake up !
help them , please . you have to help !
my mom , my dad ,

i need you to calm down
and take the baby .
hold the baby .
i don &apos;t even babysit .
i can &apos;t hold a baby .
lily , do you want me
to help your family or not ?

i don &apos;t know . three or four hours i think .
yeah , you know what ? hang on a second .
the doctor &apos;s back .
this is laura &apos;s mom .
she wants to know how long the surgery should take .
uh , that depends .
dr. altman is working on the repair right now .
did you hear that ?
um , he says dr. altman &apos;s still ...
no , altman .
no , for the heart .
y @-@ you know , c @-@ can you talk to her ?
uh , yeah .
hi , this is dr. avery .
she &apos;s a cardiothoracic surgeon .
no , no , this-- this is the heart .
no , it &apos;s really hard to tell at this point .
oh , no . this is cruel .
her husband is dead , and she has no idea .
she &apos;s sewing a woman &apos;s heart back together .
come on . there &apos;s gotta be a better way to handle this .
there &apos;s no good way to handle it , bailey .
this is an impossible decision .
so you land on the side of what is best for the patient ,
the one who &apos;s still alive .
teddy will understand .
you think so ?
you got any tape in there ?
i have to do an adhesive dressing .
probably . i just grabbed whatever .
is my mom okay ? mom ?
lily , keep counting .
why isn &apos;t-- why isn &apos;t she talking ?
lily !
how &apos;s she doing ?
not good . i may have to intubate .
don &apos;t you have to do a pressure dressing ?
i see gray matter .
brains are on the ground .
wait . that &apos;s nana .
that &apos;s my na ...
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
oh , crap .
this kid &apos;s got a shard of glass in her eye .
she &apos;s unconscious . her pulse is low .

b.p. &apos; s down and she &apos;s tachycardic .
we gotta get her up to the nicu .
13 @-@ year @-@ old female , intubated in the field .
multiple facial fractures . foreign body to the eye .
you &apos;re bleeding . you need stitches .
no , i &apos;ll be okay . i &apos;m gonna take care of it .
take the mom to trauma two .
and we need to staff as many o.r.s upstairs as possible .
we &apos;ll talk later .
what do we got ?
14 @-@ year @-@ old male , trapped under the van .
abdominal pain . last vitals show a b.p. of 100 over 80
and a pulse of 120 .
grey , you need someone to take a look at that ?
it &apos;s fine . where do you want me ?
bailey needs hands on bed four .
wait . is that my mom ?
could you get her back in the bed ?
but that--that &apos;s my mom .
she needs to be checked out .
dr. hunt , how can i help ?
what are you doing here ? is altman out of surgery ?
uh , almost . she &apos;s about to take her off bypass ,
but our pagers kept going off ,
so she figured , maybe you need some extra help .
dr. webber , i could use you on this . you , too , hunt .
i--w--
okay .
okay , go back into altman &apos;s surgery
and tell her that i didn &apos;t need you .
i was really hoping to log some more trauma hours .
kepner ...
altman &apos;s husband died in surgery ,
and she doesn &apos;t know , so i need you in the o.r.
and page me the moment that she &apos;s d--
wait , wait . i &apos;m sorry . w @-@ what ?
kepner .
henry &apos;s--
kepner , can you handle this ?
um , yeah , yes .
no . no , no , no .
you can &apos;t go into her surgery like that .
so go to the gallery and watch the surgery from there . okay ?
she went about two hours with no antibiotics
and an unknown amount of fluids &apos; cause we didn &apos;t have a pump .
all right . careful with that suction .
we weren &apos;t able to suction for a while .
her pneumonia may be getting worse .
she probably needs another x @-@ ray .
well , that &apos;s great .
you did extraordinary work tonight , karev .
i &apos;ve got it from here .
no . what ? no .
yes . you were in a major accident .
you need to go get yourself checked out .
take a breath . you &apos;re gonna sit this one out .
i &apos;m not sitting anything out .
yes , you are .
good @-@ bye .
okay , what do we got ?
his pelvis is dust .
must be massive internal bleeding .
can &apos;t keep his systolic above 68 .
okay , there &apos;s definitely free fluid in his abdomen .
it &apos;s just hard to define where the bleeding &apos;s coming from .
where do you want to start ?
pelvis .
abdomen .
abby couldn &apos;t wait to sleep in a tent .
sir , i &apos;m dr. hunt .
b.p. &apos; s still dropping .
we &apos;re gonna be taking you up to surgery .
lily didn &apos;t even want to come .
okay , if we don &apos;t stabilize this pelvis ,
there won &apos;t be any surgery .
there &apos;s no time for fixators .
she wanted to spend her birthday with friends ,
not--not camping with us .
i said no .
i made her come . oh , my god , i--
i did this to them . i did this .
you didn &apos;t harm your family .
you didn &apos;t mean for this to happen .
you didn &apos;t do this .
okay , sir , i am really sorry ,
but even with the painkillers , this is gonna hurt .
that should hold for now .
okay , let &apos;s get him to surgery .
okay .
altman paged . 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
is everything okay ?
uh , uh , we got this . go .
scrub in when you can .
you paged ?
yeah , the patient &apos;s got a flail mitral valve .
the sutures for the patch
caught on the valve when we went on bypass .
uh , what can i do ?
you can tell me where cristina is .
i &apos;ve been paging her , but she won &apos;t answer .
damn it . why won &apos;t this hold ?
okay , you need a resident ? i &apos;ll get you a resident .
no , not a resident . yang .
this is ... i need another me ,
and she is the closest thing .
don &apos;t tell her i said that .
she just got out of surgery . she &apos;s exhausted .
all right , well , splash some water on her face
and get her in here .
she can handle it . all right , sponge stick .
let &apos;s get an irrigation tray and start cleaning this up .
craniofacial lac ?
oh , it &apos;s worse than that .
we &apos;re a need a retinal @-@ vitreous surgeon .
yeah . i &apos;ve got lexie calling around for one right now .
pand is not ansering
and waldman is gonna be at least another hour .
try jassy .
jassy ?
no , i got someone who will run circles around jassy .
hey , babe .
your girlfriend ?
hold on , julia .
she &apos;s great . you &apos;ll love her .
um , you know , it &apos;s gonna take at least 45 minutes
to get here from seattle pres .
she &apos;s not at seattle pres . she &apos;s at my place .
it &apos;s five minutes away .
hey , how &apos;d you like to operate with me and derek tonight ?
it--it hurts . my stomach really hurts .
okay , michael , we gave you something for the pain .
it should kick in in a minute .
abdomen feels rigid .
yep .
free fluid in the right upper quadrant .
so that could be a liver lac . we should order a c.t.
no , keep trying !
that &apos;s my mom !
okay , michael , i need you to stay still , please .
at--what--what &apos;s going on ?
you can &apos;t just give up . you have to keep trying .
she already watched the grandmother die .
yeah , go , go .
how long you been going ?
what have you given her and what have her rhythms been ?
she has been coding for thirty minutes .
she &apos;s already gotten lidocaine and amiodarone .
okay , her kid &apos;s outside the window watching .
we need to go again .
charge to 360 .
clear .
push another of epi . let &apos;s charge again . please .
dr. grey .
damn it .
charge again .
clear .
damn it . come on . come on .
mom .
time of death--2 : 27 .
hand me the ultrasound and get me a kit .
we &apos;re doing a bedside gastrostomy .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
we need to decompress her stomach
so she doesn &apos;t get more reflux into her trachea .
karev , you &apos;re not on this case .
look , i &apos;ve been with this baby since yesterday .
okay ? she almost died . i almost died .
i didn &apos;t go through hell with this kid to just back off .
then slow down .
okay ? we don &apos;t need to rush through this .
yeah , i know . just-- suction , please .
cristina , just stop for one minute
and listen to what i have to
no . i said no .
i know you &apos;re exhausted .
this is a mitral valve re--
i am not operating now !
she requested you now .
now if you don &apos;t go in there ...
teddy requested me ?
oh , my god . you haven &apos;t told her .
you haven &apos;t told her yet ?
what are you-- no , no .
no , i am not-- no , i &apos;m not going in ...
cristina , if that patient dies on the table ,
this will all have been for nothing .
this has ...
this has to be worth something .
saving a life is worth something .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do it .
you have no choice .
she &apos;s waiting .
so go .
how much trauma has your girlfriend done ?
a lot .
she &apos;s told me about a bunch of her cases .
oh , so we &apos;re just going off your pillow talk ?
if i get a hint that your girlfriend is in over her head ,
i &apos;m gonna boot her out of my o.r ..
you know what your problem is ?
you don &apos;t think anyone who sleeps with me
can be talented or have half a brain .
that is not true .
it &apos;s mostly true .
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s mostly true .
your ex @-@ wife is brilliant , and she slept with me .
well-- i &apos;m not trying to start a fight .
i &apos;m just sayin &apos; .
ah , dr. canner ,
thank you very much for showing up on such short notice .
no problem .
fastball here just updated me about your patient .
god , again , i am-- i &apos;m really sorry
for hitting you in the--
i &apos;m fine . my breast made a quick recovery .
mm . it did .
okay , mark .
the glass penetrated the globe through to the orbit .
so she &apos;s gonna lose the eye ?
normally , yes .
i was thinking , if you used a temporal approach
to expose the orbit and decompress the eye ,
we could save it .
well , if you do that , there &apos;s more risk of bleeding .
that &apos;s true .
i could get control of the blood supply first ,
then enucleate the eye .
but i think the eye is salvageable .
either way , it &apos;s your call .
let &apos;s save the eye .
agreed .
lily .
i &apos;m so sorry about your mom .
yeah .
your dad and your sister are in surgery .
and i &apos;m about to take your brother up
to repair a tear in his liver .
okay .
do you know if anyone in your family is on any medications ?
i don &apos;t know .
what about allergies ? has--has anyone had surgery ?
i don &apos;t think so .
do you remember your parents talking about
what they would do if someone got really sick ?
would they want extraordinary measures taken ?
i &apos;m sorry . i know it &apos;s a difficult question ,
but anything you could tell us would help .
no . we don &apos;t talk about stuff like that .
we just talk about normal things ,
so i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t know anything .
well , is there anyone we can call ?
who takes care of you when your parents go out of town ?
my grandma .
but she &apos;s dead now , so ...
okay , i &apos;ve got the bleeding under control .
it &apos;s your turn , dr. canner .
all right , pull up my microscope , please .
dr. shepherd .
4 @-@ 0 silk .
thank you .
damn it .
you just push the glass in deeper ?
you must have speared a branch of the ophthalmic artery .
cautery .
all right . let me get in there .
it &apos;s kind of hard right now . my hand is in her eye .
forceps .
canner .
hold on .
there .
bone fragment .
thank you . i &apos;ll be needing that .
a little bleeding is natural , dr. shepherd .
i &apos;m not gonna find any more little presents in there , am i ?
okay , everyone , here comes the fun part .
clamp .
all right .
looks like a grade 4 liver lac .
grey , do you want to do an omental pedicle repair ?
absolutely .
okay .
heard you lost one of your clinical trial patients today ,
dr. bailey .
i &apos;m sorry to hear--
it wasn &apos;t my trial that killed him .
the man suffered from von @-@ hippel lindau .
that &apos;s what killed him .
well , i wasn &apos;t implying that your trial--
let &apos;s focus on the living patients ,
and not the dead ones , okay ?
wh @-@ what &apos;d you do ?
nothing . i &apos;m just irrigating .
his temp spiked . co2 levels are through the roof .
well , what &apos;s the problem ?
he &apos;s tachycardic .
increased heart rate . patient &apos;s burning up .
i didn &apos;t use sux , but i did use sevoflurane .
ice . we need ice .
wait . now this is my patient--
run . get ice , now .
right away , doctor .
kid &apos;s about to go into organ failure .
i &apos;m pushing dantrolene .
let &apos;s get some cooling blankets .
on it .
and turn the thermostat down in here as low as it will go .
right away , doctor .
oh , my god . malignant hyperthermia .
where &apos;s that ice ?
what do we got ?
oh , good .
i got a flail mitral valve when i took her off bypass .
just put her back on
and cooled her down again .
i need your hands .
okay .
oh , and , um ...
thank you ...
for henry .
i am so sorry that we had to lie to you ,
but you were the only one that i trusted to do it .
you get it , right ?
right .
you &apos;re not mad at me ?
no .
no .
good . okay .
go get scrubbed .
gown me .
what did altman want ? how &apos;s the patient ?
she &apos;ll be fine .
now that i put christina in there .
you ...
you what ? you put yang in the same o.r. with teddy
with my patient on the table ?
what the hell made you think that was a good idea ?
i believe it was your mistake that put everyone
in this position in the first place ,
so you &apos;re really not one to point fingers right now .
catch me up .
i can &apos;t get visualization of the mitral valve .
the--the left atrium &apos;s too small .
what about superior pulmonary vein exposure ?
yes , good . let &apos;s do that . scissors .
what is she doing up there ?
sorry ?
kepner . she &apos;s been sitting up there like a gargoyle .
i thought there was a big trauma .
oh , yeah . um , i don &apos;t know .
did you get a chance to check on henry post @-@ op
before i pulled you in here ?
i bet no one wanted her .
what ?
kepner .
probably because her voice
can peel paint off walls .
&quot; charge to 200 . &quot;
&quot; clear ! &quot;
i mean , a trauma is stressful enough .
who needs that ?
you &apos;re-- you &apos;re horrible .
&quot; push 100 of lidocaine . &quot;
am i wrong ?
i &apos;m right .
would you stop ?
stop it .
kind of .
you agree with me . i can tell ...
would you stop ?
by your eyes .
okay , stop . oh .
how are they doing ?
uh , still trying to repair the valve .
well , and making fun of me .
what ?
cristina doesn &apos;t want to talk about henry &apos;s surgery ,
so instead she &apos;s making fun of me .
i &apos;ll turn off the intercom .
no , it &apos;s ...
i have to know everything that &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s okay .
i can handle it .
still bad visualization .
there is a lot of unexpected fibrosis .
we &apos;re just increasing our chances of rupturing her heart .
we can &apos;t get in there . there &apos;s too much tension on the walls .
all right .
we need to do this right .
we &apos;re gonna do an ex vivo .
you want to the heart out ? can we--can we try to--
oh , come on , yang .
a cardiac autotransplantation
for an ex vivo valve reconstruction ?
if that &apos;s not on your bucket list , it should be .
are you up for this ?
you bet .
great . okay .
we &apos;re gonna start with the atrium
to explant the heart .
and let &apos;s get some music in here .
what do you want to listen to ? you pick ?
let &apos;s get another cooling blanket in here .
grey , let &apos;s repack this liver .
gelfoam . what &apos;s next ?
we gave him dantrolene to relax his muscles
and lidocaine to calm his heart .
he &apos;s on ice inside and out .
only thing left to do now
is wait .
all right , well , settle in .
could be a while .
dr. warren ...
isn &apos;t malignant hyperthermia genetic ?
you gotta warn them ...
already on it .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s a little full of herself if you ask me ,
but she &apos;s getting the job done , i guess .
no , the kid . abby .
you gotta watch her temp if you gave her any sux
or inhalation anesthetics because our kid had a reaction .
meredith , did you get your stitches ?
i will . fill them in .
oh , pelvic stabilization &apos;s not holding .
get me more lap pads . more .
do it . yeah . i got that .
you need something ?
you haven &apos;t used any sux
or inhalation anesthetic , have you ?
&apos;cause our kid had a reaction .
oh , damn it . this hematoma &apos;s expanding .
i &apos;ll occlude the internal iliac .
try and get some temporary control .
all right . i need more lap sponges here .
just watch his temp .
we got it , grey . thank you . hemoclip .
yeah , hold it right over there .
yep . okay , one more . come on .
let &apos;s pack it . yep .
heart rate &apos;s coming down .
his temperature &apos;s starting to stabilize .
usually about the time
you realize it &apos;s malignant hyperthermia ,
it &apos;s too late .
that &apos;s a nice catch .
you probably saved this kid &apos;s life .
figured you didn &apos;t need another patient
dying on you today .
oh , so you did it for me ?
oh , yeah .
any other doctor , i probably wouldn &apos;t have said anything .
it &apos;s freezing in here .
well , why don &apos;t you jump up and down ?
that &apos;ll warm you up ?
i think i &apos;ll repair the liver . that &apos;ll warm me up .
suction .
we have to go back in .
what ?
on the baby . i forgot to place the tension @-@ free anastomosis .
do you hear me ? i forgot to place it .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . look at me .
you did the anastomosis . i watched you do it .
you used the double @-@ layer technique .
you remember ?
i ...
okay . you need to sit down .
you need to sit down .
you are overtired
and probably experiencing some residual shock .
and you &apos;re gonna take a break this time ,
for real .
yeah , but--
no . don &apos;t argue with me , karev .
deep breath .
beautiful .
nice work .
all right . let &apos;s prepare for reimplantation .
you know , you--you &apos;re gonna think that i &apos;m crazy ,
but there is this thing
that we used to do in med school
to try and stay awake .
and after this many hours of surgery ,
you need to stay awake .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m pretty awake , actually .
whoo !
give me a &quot; whoo ! &quot;
whoo .
oh , come on . give me a &quot; whoo ! &quot;
whoo .
that &apos;s--no , that &apos;s not good . come on . you gotta wake up .
whoo !
whoo !
oh , okay , that &apos;s a little better .
they still going ?
what the hell are they doing ?
i ...
think they &apos;re having fun .
you gotta be okay .
&apos;cause we need you right now .
so ... if you can hear me ,
i &apos;m s @-@ sorry for being such a jerk on the camping trip .
i &apos;ll try to be better .
just please wake up .
you gotta wake up , and i &apos;ll be nicer .
i &apos;ll help michael with his homework
and i &apos;ll babysit .

it &apos;s about her post @-@ op instructions .
her eye needs to be covered 24 / 7 .
she can watch tv all she wants ,
but she can &apos;t read a book for the first three days .
okay .
oh , thank god that is over .
did i seem nervous in there ?
just be--be honest with me .
oh , you--you seemed more than okay .
that is derek shepherd in there ,
one of the best neurosurgeons in the country ,
and mark &apos;s best friend .
and the whole time i was in there ,
all i could think about
was my high school cross @-@ country team .
coach would always say , &quot; don &apos;t look back .
never look back , because if the kid behind you sees that ,
he knows you &apos;re weak , and he will run you down . &quot;
the whole surgery--that-- that &apos;s all i was thinking about .
don &apos;t look back .
well , you didn &apos;t .
thanks .
thank you , dr. grey .
damn it .
now i like her .
that &apos;s , like , the fourth time
you &apos;ve had to revive him tonight .
is that normal ?
his body has been through a lot .
what are those tubes for ?
uh , his body is filling with fluid ,
and those tubes are draining it .
and that ... thing
that &apos;s making noise ?
it &apos;s a ventilator .
it &apos;s breathing for him .
is he gonna wake up ?
you can tell me . i can take it .
i have no way to know that .
what do you know ?
i know that ... we haven &apos;t been able
to take him off of the life support .
and i know that it &apos;s very hard on his body
every time we try and revive him
and that it &apos;s taking longer and longer each time we try .
and his kidney tests are elevated .
which means what ?
which means that ...
his-- his organs are starting to fail , one by one .
you asked me about extraordinary measures before ,
if my parents ever talked to me about them .
what you &apos;re doing to my dad ,
are those extraordinary me--
they are .
i think you should stop .
it &apos;s not that simple .
and it &apos;s not your call .
you &apos;re his child --
i &apos;m not a child , not anymore .
i turned 18.4 hours ago .
today is my birthday .
and i &apos;ve watched you torture my dad for the past six .
so i &apos;m the head of the family now ,
and it &apos;s my job .
if you take him off the machines
and he lives , then he lives .
but if you don &apos;t ...
then at least we let him go in peace .
you gotta stop .
please .
to get around your house
okay , time to close .
would you like to do the honors ?
kepner can close .
what ?
kepner , can you close ?
uh , i @-@ i can , but -- - yang .
kepner , close .
cristina --
can i speak to you privately , please ?
what &apos;s up ? you okay ?
when we brought your husband into the o.r ,
we originally thought we could go in
with a bronchoscope and a laser ,
however , there was a lot of bleeding ,
so we had to open him up .
wait . you-- you-- wait . no . owen said that--
when we opened him up ,
we saw that his tumor had eroded his pulmonary artery .
dr. webber and i both used extraordinary measures ...
no .
but we--
uh , no , no . no .
we used extraordinary measures ,
but his heart could not tolerate
the excessive bleeding .
no .
he did not survive the surgery . i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re saying ...
you &apos;re saying , he &apos;s dead .
yes .
say it .
teddy ...
when you inform the family , you have to say it
so that they know that it &apos;s really happening .
it &apos;s the first thing that you &apos;re taught .
i never really thought about it ...
but now i get it , and , um ...
cristina ...
i need you ...
i need you to say it .
henry is dead .
thank you .
where &apos;s teddy ?
i don &apos;t know .
wait .
you told her ?
of course i did .
you shoulda let me . i should &apos;ve been the one --
oh , my god . this is not about you .
who cares who told her ?
okay , i told her ,
because you made me stand there and talk and joke
and-- and lie to her for hours ,
for hours .
i am sorry . i had to --
no , i know , i know . i don &apos;t wanna ...
i don &apos;t wanna hear it .
and neither will she .
give me the chart .
just give me the chart .
thank you .
get out .
i &apos;ll give you your privacy .
so what happens now ?
his heart rate will slow down ,
and that &apos;s gonna make the alarm sound ,
but i &apos;ll -- i can turn the sound off .
and then his breathing is going to get slower and slower .
and then his organs will start to fail
because they need oxygen to survive .
and then when there &apos;s no breathing and no pulse ,
that &apos;s when he &apos;s gone .
is this it ?
this is it , sweetie .
i &apos;ll wait outside .
no , please .
please wait .
okay , okay .
i really should be taking the fall for this .
i agree .
all right . well , then i &apos;m just gonna walk in there
and i &apos;m gonna tell him .
look , let me--let me spell it out for you , avery .
this is on me .
yes , it was your mistake ,
and , yes , you should feel like crap ,
but i &apos;m your attending ,
you &apos;re a fifth year ,
which means i &apos;m responsible for what happens in my or
and you get a free ride .
i don &apos;t want a free ride .
well , i don &apos;t want to give it to you , but i will ,
because you &apos;re still young and inexperienced
and hopefully , you &apos; learn something here .
you &apos;ll start double @-@ checking your work ,
and the work of your residents when the time comes ,
because otherwise , you &apos;ll be me ,
walking in to apologize to a family that hates me
almost as much as i hate myself right now .
dr. torres , there you are .
i need to talk to you .
i know . i know , mr. lewis . i want to talk , too .
yeah , you owe me an explanation .
okay ? a real explanation .
what happened to laura-- this is totally unacceptable .
i , uh , i understand .
i was rude to you before when you mentioned henry .
i &apos;m used to it .
it &apos;s kinda your thing .
look , when bad things happen to you , you lash out .
you want space .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m sitting way over here at my own table .
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m giving you space .
i didn &apos;t just lose a patient today .
i lost a friend .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wouldn &apos;t mind if ...
you didn &apos;t give me quite so much space .
canner did a good job .
yeah , she did .
don &apos;t screw this one up . i like her .
she &apos;s a keeper .
i &apos;ll be close by if you need me .
you can &apos;t prepare for a sudden impact .
you can &apos;t brace yourself .
it just hits you
out of nowhere .
and suddenly ...
the life you knew before ...
is over ...
forever .
what &apos;s wrong ?
there &apos;s no food , and i &apos;m hungry .
i just ordered pizza .
for breakfast ?
we &apos;ve been up for 39 straight hours .
it &apos;s dinner . it &apos;s a very , very late dinner .
oh , that cheese is old .
i &apos;m hungry . i might die .
don &apos;t eat the old cheese . come and sit down by me .
put your head down .
i &apos;d like to put a little salt on your nose
and eat a bite .
the pizza will be here any minute .
we &apos;ll be okay ...
if it &apos;s just the two of us ...
if that &apos;s what you want .
i love you .
