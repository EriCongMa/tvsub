the witness
good morning , los angeles .
you &apos;re listening to kqry , am 530 .
your source for news and traffic on the 1 .
in a moment , we &apos;ll hear from bob on sports
about l.a. &apos; s latest bid for a football team .
but first , we &apos;ll turn you over to lance howe in air 2
for a look at the road .
what &apos;s happening out there , lance ?
we &apos;ve got lots of problems , folks ,
so leave plenty of time for your morning commute .
bumper to bumper traffic already on the golden state freeway ,
plus there &apos;s a sig @-@ alert on the 405 southbound at crenshaw .
two left lanes are blocked there ,
backing up all the way to the 105 .
we &apos;re getting rep--
hello .
charlie , i have been calling you for 4 hours .
are you on the bus ?
no . i have an early meeting , remember ?
where have you been ?
i told you i needed to clear my head ...
so i went for a drive .
you drove all night ?
i got sleepy , so i pulled over .
we have a team meeting in 20 minutes . will you be here ?
no . i &apos;m going to be late .
well , i can &apos;t show you any favoritism because we &apos;re married .
i &apos;m going to have to dock you 10 points off your quarterly eval .
do what you have to .
charlie , what is going on ?
are you jealous because i got the promotion and you didn &apos;t ?
i &apos;m not jealous about your job .
how many times do i have to say that i &apos;m sorry ?
i made a mistake .
it was a one @-@ time thing .
i wish i could believe that .
you were looking for reasons to stay angry .
i just want what we used to have ...
when jolene was little
and it was just the 3 of us ...
happy in our own little bubble .
before i burst it . is that what you &apos;re saying ?
look , i have to go .
and you have got to stop punishing me ,
or there &apos;s no hope for us .
perfect .
listen , my bus is here , so i gotta go . bye .
whoa ! whoa , whoa . you ok ?
we need to get inside , so if you &apos;ll open up .
hey ! call 911 !
hey , open the door !
open the door !
oh , my god .
the weirdest killer i ever worked with
was archie sutton , the truck stop strangler .
even worse than the indonesian female cannibal ?
oddly enough , yes .
archie had this strange obsession with talcum powder and butterflies .
so he would sprinkle talcum on all of his food
and then carry a dead butterfly
in his pocket everywhere he went .
it &apos;s amazing you were able to
find something that you could identify with .
well , i had to . i met with him every week for a year .
it was the only way to establish a therapeutic alliance .
what was it you guys had in common ?
we were both obsessed with fossils when we were kids ,
and both of our mothers attended the same elementary school class .
a bizarre coincidence , right ?
what &apos;s a coincidence ?
tara &apos;s mom went to the same elementary school
as the truck stop strangler &apos;s mom .
ok , that &apos;s a little creepy somehow .
don &apos;t get comfortable . the plane &apos;s waiting for us .
10 minutes ago there was a poison gas attack
on a city link commuter bus in los angeles .
10 confirmed dead so far .
do we know what it was ?
hazmat just got on the scene .
chlorine gas was used recently in syria .
maybe it &apos;s connected .
it also reminds me of the attack on the tokyo subway .
religious cult members carried plastic bags of sarin
and punctured them with umbrella tips .
that was 1995 . it could be a 20th year anniversary event .
we &apos;ll find out .
charlie , you &apos;re ok .
uh , yeah . yeah . sorry i &apos;m late .
uh , traffic was horrible .
we were worried . we know you take the city link .
i drove today . what &apos;s , um , what &apos;s going on ?
didn &apos;t you hear ?
there was some kind of poison attack on your bus .
police have still not allowed any reporters near the scene .
and local residents have been evacuated .
you ok ?
you look ... awful .
yeah . yeah . no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m fine . uh ...
this poison attack , that &apos;s , uh , that &apos;s horrible .
yeah , i &apos;ll say .
you &apos;re pretty damn lucky .
the mayor &apos;s office and lapd
have issued a citywide tactical alert ,
as we are awaiting a press conference with the police chief .
continuing live coverage from logan park , where 10 people ,
including the driver ,
have been found dead on a city link commuter bus .
officials suspect a poison gas attack ,
but lab tests are pending .
&quot; it is in your moments of decision
that your destiny is shaped . &quot;
tony robbins .
oh , crime @-@ fighters , i just got confirmation from the l.a. field office
that traces of sarin were found .
sarin is the most volatile nerve agent there is .
symptoms are felt within seconds .
watery eyes , foaming at the nose and mouth ,
and convulsions , paralysis , and death within minutes .
the last known use of sarin
was two years ago in syria , near damascus .
we &apos;ve had recent threats
of terrorism targeting major u.s. cities .
the religious cult responsible for the tokyo subway attack
20 years ago is also still active .
very much so , but they &apos;ve
split into two branches with different names .
there &apos;s over 2,100 members
and 4 of them are in southern california .
where &apos;s the leader ?
shoko asahara &apos;s on death row in japan .
he &apos;s incoherent and confined to a wheelchair .
so he &apos;s not calling any shots .
no , but that doesn &apos;t rule
out devout followers doing it in his name .
garcia , what do you know about the casualties ?
aside from the i.d.s , not much .
well , it &apos;s 6 men and 4 women ,
age range 20 to 60 .
victimology seems to be pretty random .
here &apos;s the thing-- sarin
evaporates quickly , it &apos;s hard to control ,
and would thus be very difficult to target an individual .
collateral damage may mask the real target .
garcia , look into the victims
and also anyone online claiming responsibility .
aye aye , captain .
hey , charlie . a messenger dropped this off for you .
here you go .
thank you .
\ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h \ h我就不会告诉警察
aaron hotchner . it &apos;s been a long time .
natalie , congratulations on the transfer .
well , nice way to start a new job , huh ?
tell me about it .
agent colfax , this is dr. tara lewis .
nice to meet you .
and ssa derek morgan .
thanks for coming out .
so , based on victim toxicology ,
we know that sarin was used .
we still can &apos;t find the source .
here &apos;s what we do know .
city link bus 290 originated at the red line depot at 7 a.m.
it made 6 stops before logan park ,
which is where the crash occurred .
what about the locals affiliated
with the former religious cult in japan ?
they all claim they broke ties with their leader
after he was sentenced and have denounced terrorism .
that &apos;s a convenient thing to say when the fbi &apos;s questioning you .
true , but they &apos;re also part of a subgroup
that made the same statement publicly back in 2007 .
plus all their alibis checked out .
so briarwood is the stop before logan park ?
yes . we &apos;ve been focusing on footage there .
so far , all of the victims were alive
on surveillance at briarwood .
one of them bring the sarin in and then commit suicide ?
i &apos;ve examined all the bodies
and there &apos;s no physical evidence of that .
it &apos;s a parlor room mystery .
ah . ok , so we have some more information on the victims .
two are students at allegra college .
one &apos;s an accountant . one works for an insurance company .
3 work at the city clerk &apos;s office . one is a teacher .
but this is interesting .
michael hoffman was a freelance journalist
who previously worked in syria .
over 100 journalists have
been killed there since the civil war began .
maybe hoffman was targeted . i &apos;ll have garcia look into it .
and in the meantime , we need to take a closer look
at all the stops before logan park ,
including the surrounding areas .
have them pull surveillance footage
from atms , security , and traffic cameras .
yeah , will do .
i &apos;m agent young .
the hazmat teams says they &apos;re almost done
with their decontamination .
well , the good news with sarin , if there is such a thing ,
is that it &apos;s a relatively short @-@ lived threat .
once it dissipates , there &apos;s very little cleanup to be done .
excuse me .
if sarin is so fast and deadly ,
how can someone release it without harming themselves in the process ?
excellent question . the cult members in tokyo
wore surgical masks , and even with them ,
some of them were still injured . i &apos;m guessing that--
the techs just found this ,
stuck under a seat in the third row .
it tested positive for sarin residue .
it looks like some kind of time @-@ release device .
looks homemade .
it &apos;s battery operated .
you know , it reminds me of an automatic fish food feeder .
how would it work ?
with a fish food feeder , there &apos;s a disk inside
with multiple slots . each slot is filled with fish food .
as the disk rotates , the food is released at very specific times .
my assumption is , with this device ,
only one slot was filled with sarin ,
because even in a miniscule amount , sarin is deadly .
so someone could have planted that a long time ago .
how long ago ?
my fish food feeder lasts 6 weeks ,
so , theoretically ...
the unsub could have left all the slots empty
except for the very last one ,
and then waited 6 weeks for the sarin to be released .
we need to look at everyone who got on and off that bus
for the last month and a half .
great .
all right , thanks , reid .
so if the device was homemade ,
maybe the sarin was , too .
well , that &apos;d be difficult . the process is dangerous .
the aum cult actually built a $ 30 million production facility
to make their sarin .
all right , so that rules out the average joe ,
but a trained chemist could still make it .
and nobody &apos;s claimed responsibility ?
i don &apos;t think this is the act of a large group .
ok . so we &apos;re looking for somebody with a personal ax to grind
who also has access to sarin .
hey , what you got , baby girl ?
someone described michael hoffman ,
the journalist victim ,
as cowardly for leaving syria in 2011,
just when the trouble started . but one man &apos;s cowardice
is another man &apos;s wise risk aversion .
garcia , did he write
anything that could make him a potential target ?
nothing . everything &apos;s really non @-@ offensive .
and i have delicate sensibilities .
it &apos;s part of your charm , mama .
garcia , i need you to look in the l.a. area
for any chemists with extremist views ,
especially any that might have been under stress .
marital , financial , et cetera .
ok . chemists under mucho stress .
i am on it .
thanks .
hello ?
wrong answer , charlie .
do you really think you can get away with it ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . who is this ?
i &apos;m your best friend . or your worst enemy .
it &apos;s up to you .
what do you want from me ?
it &apos;s simple , really .
i &apos;m texting you an address .
i need you to break in and get a laptop .
wait , wait , wait . break in ? are you crazy ?
are you really one to judge ?
listen to me .
no . you listen to me .
you know that sweet daughter of yours , jolene ?
you love her , don &apos;t you ?
you want to see her graduate ,
maybe get married someday .
if you hurt jolene--
i don &apos;t need to . you already did .
what &apos;s gonna happen to her if you go to prison ?
how often do you think she &apos;ll visit ? once ? twice ?
maybe you &apos;ll never see her again . is that what you want ?
you should have thought of that before you committed murder .
you &apos;re a real mystery , charlie .
you &apos;ve got quite a dark streak .
charlie .
you could have been killed this morning .
if you got on that city link ...
we &apos;re so lucky .
i think i &apos;ve let this job get in the way of our relationship .
and i know that it sounds hokey , but ...
i feel like the universe has given us another chance .
i want to go away together .
can we do that ?
sure .
good .
maybe next weekend .
sarah .
have you found my cell phone yet ?
i swear it was on my desk yesterday .
assuming this wasn &apos;t a fresh batch of sarin ,
where would you get this stuff premade ?
technically nowhere .
after the u.n. banned the use of chemical weapons ,
everyone was supposed to destroy their stockpiles by 2007 .
go ahead , garcia .
i come bearing information gifts .
there are many chemists in the l.a. area ,
but one in particular is johann geitman .
he was fired two months ago from holder industries
for online gambling at work .
he posted a huge rant on social media
saying that they would come to regret what they did .
could be retaliation .
we should talk to him .
yeah , here &apos;s the thing . i have a p.o. box
where he gets his mail , but i don &apos;t have a current address ,
and he canceled his cell phone two weeks ago .
all right , keep digging .
i will turn over every kilobyte till he is found .
thanks .
hey . you &apos;re gonna want to see this .
you asked us to look at surveillance
in the areas that the city link stops .
we picked this up from the commuter parking lot
at the victory depot this morning .
according to the time marker ,
he parks here , just before bus 290 arrives .
then he leaves ...
and then he returns to his car a few minutes later .
so he never got on the bus .
nope . running the license plate now .
he gets back into his car , he &apos;s holding something .
what is that ?
bottle of water ?
maybe it &apos;s sarin .
he &apos;s cleaning his hands and clothes with it .
why would he be doing that ?
washing with soap and water is what you &apos;re supposed to do
immediately after you get exposed to sarin .
ok . our car belongs to a charles senarak .
he lives in simi valley and works at banning medical supply .
and he &apos;s a regular commuter on the city link
but didn &apos;t ride this morning .
we need to pay mr. senarak a visit .
you saw me sitting in my car ?
on surveillance footage at victory station , yes .
is it a crime to be in my car ?
the bus that was attacked
with sarin this morning stopped at that station ,
so we have to look at anything unusual .
wait , you think i had something to do with the sarin attack ?
we just want to know what you were doing in your car ,
because the bus came and went while you were still there .
look , we know that you
and your wife are both city link commuters .
you both have monthly passes .
you &apos;ve taken that bus every single day
for the past month and yet today you both missed it .
uh , tracy had an early morning management meeting ,
and i had a late night .
i was trying to clean myself up ,
and , um , i just wasn &apos;t paying attention when the bus left .
what were you doing last night ?
went to a bar . the old sea tavern .
and then for a long drive .
晚上十点 三号房
was anybody with you ?
no . i was alone .
you do that often , go to a bar and drink alone ?
no . but i was feeling down .
hmm . why is that ?
i found ...
it was , uh , my mother &apos;s birthday ,
and she died a few years ago ,
so i was feeling depressed . that &apos;s all .
one of your co @-@ workers said that you were acting strangely today .
i just said i was depressed .
about your mother .
yeah .
any other reason ?
with your work or marriage ?
no .
everything &apos;s fine .
look , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m acting strange
on the day that there &apos;s a sarin attack ,
but it &apos;s just a coincidence .
i had nothing to do with it . nothing .
thank you . we &apos;ll be in touch .
thank you .
thanks .
you think he &apos;s telling the truth ?
about the sarin attack , yes .
but he &apos;s lying about something . i just can &apos;t put my finger on it .
not much we can do about that , though .
oh , you &apos;d be surprised .
garcia , i need you to confirm charlie senarak &apos;s alibi .
and find out everything you can about him .
the victim has been positively i.d. &apos; d as johann geitman .
wait , the chemist who was fired from holder industries ?
yes . he died of a single gunshot wound to the head .
the m.e. says based on reversal of rigor mortis ,
time of death was 36 hours ago .
you said you got an anonymous tip ?
about an hour ago . we got a call about the sound of gunfire .
that &apos;s odd . it definitely doesn &apos;t match his time of death .
well , somebody broke in .
there &apos;s glass all over the ground .
who owns this cabin ?
it &apos;s a vacation home for a hong kong businessman
who hasn &apos;t been here in over a year .
any connection to geitman ?
no . maybe geitman broke in and was squatting here .
it &apos;s possible , but geitman didn &apos;t do this .
he &apos;d have cleaned up the glass if he was living here .
i think whoever killed geitman came in this way .
so the body was found there .
well , it looks like geitman camped out here for a while .
was he making sarin here ?
i don &apos;t see any signs of it .
whoever killed geitman took his computer .
probably to hide evidence .
agent , the way we drove up here , is that the only way in ?
yeah .
because the only gas station i remember seeing
was about 25 miles back .
there &apos;s a reasonable chance
that whoever killed geitman stopped there .
so we should pull surveillance footage if they have any .
i &apos;m on it .
geitman &apos;s former employer , holder industries ,
is one of the oldest chemical companies around .
they were a major supplier of sarin to the u.s
military in the 1950s .
i know you said all stockpiles
should have been destroyed by 2007,
but what if they weren &apos;t ?
what if holder industries still had some ?
and geitman may have known where it was .
the unsub bought it from him
and then killed him so he couldn &apos;t talk .
which means chances are good
the unsub has more sarin that what was used .
we need to deliver the profile .
the recent sarin attack is a case of domestic terrorism ,
on a small scale , not unlike the boston marathon bombing .
we believe that one or two individuals
have perpetrated the attack ,
not a large group .
these individuals may have splintered off
a bigger group , though .
the motive could be revenge or ideologically based ,
but keep in mind , it is possible
that someone is only using ideology as a front .
we believe a chemist named johann geitman
provided the sarin in the recent attack .
geitman may have been a supplier working on his own ,
or he may have been a part of a partnership that soured .
we &apos;re looking for any information
regarding geitman &apos;s recent whereabouts
or any individuals he may have had contact with .
the fact that the unsub chose sarin as his weapon
and is using a time @-@ release device
means that this guy is criminally sophisticated ,
meticulous , and extremely patient .
this suggests that he &apos;s older ,
perhaps in his late 30s , possibly 40s .
can i have another one , dad ?
dad ?
what ?
can i have another pancake ?
yeah . yeah , sure .
the contained nature of the attack could mean
that a partnership is falling apart
and that only a portion of the plan was carried out .
dad .
did you get a new phone ?
uh , yeah , yeah , yeah , i did .
or given the likelihood
that the sarin came from an old stockpile ,
this was simply a test of its potency .
therefore something much larger in scale is being planned .
the longer this unsub remains free ,
the more emboldened he will be to launch another attack .
we need to monitor all modes of public transportation
and increase patrols at airports and train and bus terminals .
thank you .
did you get that laptop ?
yeah . but you didn &apos;t tell me there &apos;d be a dead man there .
i didn &apos;t know . it doesn &apos;t really matter .
it doesn &apos;t matter ?
you just linked me to a murder .
that &apos;s really funny , charlie .
are you forgetting you killed your wife &apos;s lover ?
theo koutranis ?
what the hell do you want ?
leave my wife alone .
if you gave here what she needed ,
maybe she &apos;d leave me alone .
just stay calm , charlie .
as long as you behave ,
your secret is safe with me .
what did i do to you ?
why are you blackmailing me ?
don &apos;t be so melodramatic .
i just want us to help each other .
i need you to go to a warehouse
and pick up a package for me .
forget it .
hey , charlie , it &apos;s 7 : 15 .
don &apos;t you need to take
that beautiful daughter of yours to school ?
daddy , we &apos;re gonna be late .
ok , honey .
i &apos;m sending you an address .
you need to be there at 4 : 00 today .
well , we were right . geitman was interested
in holder industry &apos;s sarin stockpile .
we interviewed his supervisor ,
he said he asked about it two months ago .
now , although geitman didn &apos;t express any extremist tendencies ,
he was in deep financial trouble .
in addition to the online gambling , he owed back taxes
and he invested heavily in a company that eventually went bankrupt .
so he just sold the sarin for the money ,
and the unsub killed him so he couldn &apos;t talk .
so , we reviewed the surveillance footage
from the gas station near the cabin .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what we found .
a red subaru was there yesterday evening just after 10 p.m.
let me guess .
it was driven by our very own charlie senarak ?
yep .
garcia , what did you find out about charlie senarak ?
charlie reminds me of the color beige ,
not that there &apos;s anything wrong with the color beige ,
aside from the fact that &apos;s the only color i look bad in .
he &apos;s worked for the last 14 years as a sales associate
at banning medical supply .
his wife works there , too .
they &apos;ve been married for 13 years . her name is tracy .
she got a promotion 4 months ago to team manager .
they have a 12 @-@ year @-@ old daughter jolene .
he has no criminal record . he has no traffic tickets .
his social media posts are just like--he &apos;s beige .
i don &apos;t know . this guy doesn &apos;t fit our profile at all .
but it can &apos;t just be a coincidence
he was at the gas station near the cabin .
garcia , any recent purchases that stand out ?
handgun ? ammunition ?
no , nothing i can see .
except the last 3 months ,
he has a lot of credit card charges
to a marriage counselor .
so he lied about his marriage being fine .
what &apos;s his mother &apos;s birthday ?
give me a sec .
january 10th .
and not two days ago like he said .
so what else is charlie lying about ?
so who was that ?
theo koutranis &apos; brother .
theo &apos;s missing .
no one knows where he is .
so why is his brother asking you ?
because theo was a manager at the irvine branch ,
and we had a regional meeting on monday . ok ?
he wanted to know if theo had said anything about going away .
and why would theo tell you that ?
because we work together , which means we occasionally talk .
it does not mean that we are sleeping together .
you sure ?
really , charlie ?
you want to do this right now ?
right here at work ?
honestly , i don &apos;t think i can take this anymore .
maybe it is too late for us .
if you leave , you can &apos;t have jolene .
i won &apos;t let you take her away from me .
go ahead , penelope .
charlie senarak isn &apos;t beige at all .
he &apos;s a verdant green . a month ago ,
he went on this ranty facebook post
about men who cheat with married women ,
then early yesterday morning he deleted it .
i was just able to recover it ,
and his internet search history--
hot magma of homicidal rage
doesn &apos;t even begin to cover it .
maybe charlie found out his wife was having an affair .
if that &apos;s the case , he could be spiraling
and lashing out at the world .
thanks , penelope , we &apos;re at his office now .
can i help you ?
we &apos;re looking for charlie senarak .
i &apos;m his wife . is something wrong ?
we &apos;re with the fbi .
we &apos;re just looking to follow up with him .
where is he ?
he left a half an hour ago .
i think he had a meeting with a client .
i &apos;m charlie senarak .
i &apos;m here to pick up a package .
you &apos;re not blocking the driveway , are you ?
um , no . i &apos;m parked out front .
wait here .
hello ? !
is anyone there ? !
sorry , man . took me a little while to find it .
is that it ?
yep .
what &apos;s in it ?
beats me .
my phone was in charlie &apos;s desk ?
i don &apos;t understand .
your husband &apos;s hiding something .
we think he &apos;s connected to the sarin attack .
we just don &apos;t know how , exactly .
that &apos;s impossible .
that &apos;s not like charlie at all .
you were having an affair , weren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;d be surprised what
someone with a broken heart will do .
who was it with ?
theo koutranis .
but i was trying to end it with him .
did charlie know that ?
he thought it was already over .
but theo was ... persistent .
oh , my god .
what ?
theo &apos;s been missing for two days .
his brother was here earlier looking for him .
may i ?
it looks like theo sent you a text two days ago .
&quot; meet me at the desert bloom inn , 10 p.m. , room 3 . &quot;
i never--i never got this .
because charlie had your phone ,
which means that he saw it .
so he know you were still having an affair .
maybe he went to confront theo .
mrs. senarak .
charlie didn &apos;t come home two nights ago .
he said he was driving around .
that was the night before the attack .
tell us more about theo koutranis .
you think i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on ?
are you driving , charlie ?
pull over . you don &apos;t want to get a ticket , do you ?
you &apos;re setting me up .
you &apos;re making it look like
i &apos;m responsible for the sarin attack ,
but you did it . who the hell are you ? !
you &apos;re imagining things .
no , no , you--you made me pick up
a gas mask and a hazmat suit ,
and you made me steal a laptop from a dead man ,
and i know who he is now .
don &apos;t do this to yourself .
he &apos;s that chemist who &apos;s been all over the news .
do you think i &apos;m an idiot ? huh ? ! do you ? !
i think you &apos;re a man without any options , charlie .
no , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , huh ?
you ... you think you can set me up ?
well , what if i turn you in ? !
just stop .
no , the fbi &apos;s offering a million @-@ dollar award for information .
i can give ... i can give them this cell phone
and they can probably trace it back to you .
all our conversations have been recorded somewhere .
that &apos;s what the nsa does , isn &apos;t it ? !
they record every conversation !
you need to calm down .
no ! no ! you do not get to tell me what to do anymore !
and i &apos;m not gonna be your patsy !
shut up , charlie , and listen to me .
listen carefully .
i &apos;ve been watching you all along ,
from the very beginning
when you pulled into the desert bloom inn .
you set the wheels in motion the second you murdered theo .
there &apos;s no way out for you charlie .
do you really think you &apos;re not being watched now ?
by the way ,
wasn &apos;t your daughter wearing a yellow sweatshirt today ?
jolene !
talk to me , penelope .
you were right , handsome italian man .
theo koutranis is more than just a lover boy .
his name used to be theo martin .
he grew up in the heaven &apos;s mission cult compound in southern utah .
he was one of 50 ...
50 illegitimate children of the cult leader ,
who had vehement anti @-@ government views .
shades of david koresh .
oh , sure . and 8 years ago ,
he moved here with his half @-@ brother mitchell crossford .
uh , mitchell blogged about
launching terrorist attacks here in the united states .
they shared an apartment up until 3 months ago .
3 months ago is right around the time
theo started having an affair with tracy senarak .
what if theo and mitchell
were planning a terrorist attack together ,
but then theo started to have second thoughts ?
that is the sound of you nailing it , braniac doctor ,
because for the last month , twice a day , every day ,
mitchell has called theo .
theo only answered once ,
and the last text mitchell sent him was ,
&quot; you can &apos;t run away . i know everything you do . &quot;
penelope , dig up everything you can
about the brother mitchell crossford .
copy copy .
the two brothers were planning a terrorist attack together
util they had a falling @-@ out over tracy senarak .
so you think charlie went
to confront theo about sleeping with his wife ?
it certainly looks that way .
theo &apos;s been missing for two days .
there &apos;s a good chance charlie killed him .
ok . &quot; you can &apos;t run away .
i know everything you do . &quot;
what if mitchell crossford was following his brother around ,
trying to bring him back into the fold ?
which means he also could have witnessed charlie murder theo .
so we sent agents to the last location
where theo koutranis &apos; cell phone pinged .
they just found what looks like a shallow grave
about a mile into the desert just west of desert bloom inn .
i &apos;ll go check it out with rossi .
go ahead , garcia .
mitchell crossford was definitely
the alpha in the relationship .
he and his mother left the cult compound when he was 10 .
they moved to phoenix ,
where he built quite the juvenile record .
probation officers described him as cold , intelligent ,
and scarily manipulative .
he had extremist views , and at 16 he ran right back
into the brainwashy arms of the heaven &apos;s mission cult .
where presumably he found a partner in crime in theo .
until theo fell in love with tracy senarak .
guys , tracy rode the city link bus frequently .
what if in addition to testing out his stock ,
mitchell planted the sarin there to kill her ?
makes sense . he wanted his partner back ,
and there &apos;s a good chance that plan would have worked ,
except tracy didn &apos;t get on the bus that day .
i still don &apos;t understand how charlie &apos;s involved .
mitchell witnessed the murder of theo ,
realized he could turn charlie into a patsy .
charlie obvious rides the same bus as his wife ,
so he already looked culpable .
come on ! get out of the way !
if mitchell is this manipulative ,
then he sent charlie to
the cabin where the dead chemist was found
to make it look like he had committed the murder .
and then he called in an anonymous tip .
tracy senarak said theo &apos;s brother came in the office
looking for him today . why would he do that ?
to establish his innocence and an alibi .
an alibi for what just happened ?
or what he &apos;s planning next .
hey , garcia , what are mitchell &apos;s specific views ?
沃伦 · 杰夫斯 被判入狱服刑119年
he felt the government needed to pay for what they did in waco
and to the flds prophet warren jeffs .
well , that means the fbi is enemy number one .
he &apos;s coming here .
what are you -- stop !
we have a security breach , east parking structure !
get out of the car !
hey , he has my daughter !
step away from the vehicle !
she &apos;s in the black van !
you have to help me !
turn around ! get on your knees !
these are the same sarin
devices as the ones on the city link bus .
i didn &apos;t do it . i swear .
we know .
look , he &apos;s got my daughter .
she &apos;s 12 . she &apos;s wearing a yellow sweatshirt .
you have to help her , please !
these could go off any second .
it &apos;s 4 : 55 . the garage is gonna be flooded
with people leaving work in 5 minutes .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s waiting for .
we need a hazmat decon .
there &apos;s no time . evacuate the garage . turn off the ventilators and seal it .
we &apos;re clear .
yeah , morgan .
hotch , there &apos;s no one in the van .
it &apos;s a mannequin with a yellow shirt .
copy that .
we need to evacuate the facility .
there &apos;s over a thousand people here .
once sarin vaporizes , it &apos;s deadly
in the immediate environment ,
but it &apos;s heavier than air , so eventually it sinks .
all right , lock down the rest of the building . nobody leaves .
no sign of mitchell crossford in the garage ,
but he &apos;s definitely here .
all right , colfax , we &apos;re going to need plans of the building .
talk to me . what &apos;s going on ?
garcia , i need you to tap
into surveillance and find mitchell crossford .
he just drove here in a black van .
got it . i &apos;m reviewing the security tapes now .
ok , i got him . i got him exiting the van .
he &apos;s walking to a parking garage elevator .
he &apos;s got a bag in his hand .
that could be more sarin .
ok . i &apos;m trying to find where he went .
we &apos;re running out of time .
i &apos;m moving as fast as i can .
got him . he &apos;s on the basement level .
he &apos;s walking toward the west elevators .
colfax , i need those plans !
pulling them up now .
where did he go ? i just saw him
and i don &apos;t see him anywhere .
well , keep looking .
ok .
here we go .
all right , crossford loves being a mastermind .
he &apos;d want to witness all the chaos he &apos;s causing .
what &apos;s the best vantage point ?
there .
we &apos;ll split up and cover each floor .
put your hands on your head .
put your hands on your head .
mitchell crossford , you &apos;re under arrest .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law .
you have a right to an attorney .
&quot; the world is so unpredictable .
things happen suddenly , unexpectedly .
we want to feel we &apos;re in control of our own existence .
in some ways we are , in some ways we &apos;re not .
we are ruled by the forces of chance and coincidence . &quot;
paul auster .
a little light reading ?
just , uh--i &apos;m revisiting an old favorite .
i take it you prefer jung to freud ?
oh , absolutely . i feel like freud gave jung too hard a time
for his interest in the paranormal .
speaking of which , what do you think of synchronicity ?
it &apos;s my favorite police album .
no , i mean , uh , events that seem significantly related
but have no discernable causal connection .
the fact that your mom and the truck stop strangler &apos;s mom
were in the same elementary school class
really got me thinking .
how so ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not odd
that they were in the same class .
what &apos;s really strange is that one would have a child
who grew up to be a serial killer ,
the other would have a child that grew up to be
an fbi profiler
and that the two of you would meet someday .
yeah . so , what &apos;s the take @-@ away ?
i don &apos;t know .
maybe the events in our lives
were set in motion a long time ago .
there &apos;s an old buddhist saying that ,
when you meet your soulmate ,
remember that the act to bring you together
was 500 years in the making .
so , always appreciate and be kind to each other .
that &apos;s lovely .
there &apos;s a corollary for friends .
when you meet a true friend ,
you &apos;ll be bound together through space and time
for 500 years .
which means ...
in the year 2200,
i &apos;m gonna get morgan back for that practical joke
he played on me last week .
bring it , pretty boy .
i &apos;ll be waitin &apos; for you .
i &apos;ll be there .
