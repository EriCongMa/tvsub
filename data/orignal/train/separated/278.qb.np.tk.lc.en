here you go , earl .
table 12 throwing down a credit card on a patty melt .
they really need those eight airline miles ?
where they going ... new jersey ?
credit cards are the downfall of america .
well , credit cards and kim kardashian .
i like her big ass as much as the next man ,
but don &apos;t go give the damn butt a franchise .
max , i can take a lot .
please keep your sex life to yourself .
i handled it when i lost my fortune ,
and i handled it when i lost my fortune .
you said that twice .
because i think it bears repeating .
but this is too much .
that couple that just left ... a $ 50 check ,
a $ 1.47 tip .
47 cents ?
uh , i wasn &apos;t even aware they were still making pennies .
i smiled and bent over backwards , giving them service ...
all for $ 1.47 ?
this makes me the lowest @-@ paid hooker in new york .
all right , give me that check . i &apos;ll handle this .
hey !
was something wrong with the service my girl over here gave you ?
no . tipping &apos;s an option .
so is me spitting in your food .
you might want to remember that the next time
you leave a waitress pennies .
i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know .
this was our first and last date .
sorry , dude .
looks like this little tip
just lost you the chance to give her your little tip .
max , come in , sit down .
there &apos;s something we have to talk about .
this can &apos;t be about my drinking .
i don &apos;t have the money to be a real alcoholic .
can you sit in that chair , please ?
i never sit in that chair .
well , today we &apos;re doing things differently ...
breaking our patterns .
hold up .
did you join scientology ?
饱受争议 常被媒体与前信徒描述为邪教
and i went to starbucks and got you a coffee
and a vanilla bear claw .
a bear claw ? awesome ! i &apos;ll sit anywhere you want .
my life is not where i want it to be .
that $ 1.47 tip was a wake @-@ up call reminding me
that life will always undervalue you
if you let it .
yes , i &apos;ve been knocked down ,
but now it &apos;s time to fight back and grab life by the balls .
i don &apos;t know if life likes having its balls grabbed .
some guys do , but those are usually the ones
who want you to spoon them .
i &apos;d like to explain my vision for our future by walking you through
my vision board .
oh , no .
it &apos;s a simple tool .
you &apos;re a simple tool .
you start with a thin , white board ...
your thin , white , and i &apos;m bored .
keep going . i can do this all day .
i have a bear claw in me .
i &apos;ve been making vision boards for years ,
and i always achieve my goals .
and you think it &apos;s that crazy little board
and not your father &apos;s billions ?
max , it works .
you put up pictures and inspirational words
of things you want in your life .
see ? i have success , a cupcake business ,
and a picture of a beautiful new bed .
ah , the ones at the asylum look different than that ,
so don &apos;t get attached .
sleeping on that couch is holding me back .
i never get a restful night &apos;s sleep ,
and i need a good nine hours .
what you need is a good nine inches .
that should be on your vision board .
it is ... on the back .
nice .
now , unless you &apos;re willing to switch the bedroom
every other week ...
no , that sounds mormon .
then i want to install a murphy bed in here .
the bed folds up against the wall during the day ,
so you &apos;d still maintain your signature williamsburg
&quot; i don &apos;t care about anything chic or nice &quot; decor .
who &apos;s going to build it ? &apos; cause it &apos;s not me .
i &apos;m already being taken advantage of
at my babysitting job .
peach has me lugging things back and forth
to help with the twins &apos; first birthday party .
i &apos;ve been sorting through clown resumes for a week .
peach is throwing a birthday party ?
did you ask her if we can cater the desserts ?
she hires fancy people with real companies .
we &apos;re not a real business .
see ? this is what i &apos;m talking about .
you mock the vision board , but look ...
here it is , our cupcake shop .
i don &apos;t think we can both fit in there .
max , you have to start imagining what our life can be .
you deserve a cupcake shop , and i deserve a new bed .
all you have to do is dream it .
no , all you have to do is do it .
and for you to build a murphy bed ,
it &apos;ll take a miracle .
so unless you have jesus or
&lt; i &gt; jesus &lt; / i &gt; on that board ...
not going to happen .
who is it ?
it &apos;s &lt; i &gt; jesus ... &lt; / i &gt;
from williamsburg hardware .
we got your do @-@ it @-@ yourself murphy bed .
see how i made that happen ?
vision .
so which one of them has the nine inches ?
guess what i did today ?
&lt; i &gt; jesus ? &lt; / i &gt;
what do you think ?
i think the bed still isn &apos;t built .
no , but it &apos;s almost finished .
look ...
notice anything different about me ?
i have answer .
you had boob job .
your &quot; b &quot; s have turned into &quot; c &quot; s ,
and for that , i give you an &quot; a. &quot;
no , i had my uniform altered .
yes , life dealt me a bad uniform ,
but with a little vision ,
i can shape it the way it works best for me .
that should be a tip in your inspirational book ,
which i &apos;m guessing is called
cutting pictures out of magazines
isn &apos;t just for serial killers anymore .
and this is exciting ... look .
the other really important thing i did today ...
made us business cards .
now you can give one to peach
and throw our hat into the party ring .
you &apos;re her babysitter . you already have a connection .
yeah , a connection to her babies &apos; asses .
see ? that &apos;s your limited vision .
plus , peach is interviewing this gay guy
who used to work for martha stewart .
i mean , gay , martha stewart ... we can &apos;t top that .
just give her the cards . we have to start somewhere .
see ? &quot; max &apos;s homemade cupcakes . &quot;
and look ... &quot; max black , owner / baker . &quot;
&quot; owner / baker &quot; ?
that &apos;s pretty cool .
see ? there it is .
it &apos;s real .
but the name sucks a big one .
&quot; homemade ... &quot; it sounds like homeschooled ,
like we &apos;re churning out cupcakes
that aren &apos;t comfortable around other people .
or it sounds delicious .
and the cupcake on the card has a cherry on it .
my cupcakes don &apos;t have a cherry ...
haven &apos;t since i was 13 .
if you could really get under his shoulder blades ...
that &apos;s where he carries all his stress .
don &apos;t say your real thoughts .
don &apos;t say your real thoughts .
max , we &apos;re using our spa voice today .
use my spa voice ? okay .
i can &apos;t afford this .
i want you to make sure the twins
drink lots of water after ,
you know , to flush out the toxins .
toxins ?
all they drink is breast milk .
i can &apos;t be sure what the woman i buy that from
puts in her body .
we &apos;re all so tense about the birthday party .
if everything isn &apos;t perfect ,
how will they live with the shame ?
um , peach , um ...
speaking of the ... the party ,
uh , i @-@ i started this , um , thing ,
and it &apos;s probably dumb , but ...
i don &apos;t need it . like , i &apos;m fine .
i don &apos;t need it . it &apos;s just more like ...
like a ... like a ... favor .
um , but , uh , the thing is , there &apos;s the cards ,
so i was thinking may ... &quot; maybly ... &quot;
&quot; maybly &quot; ? what &apos;s that ? it &apos;s not a word , right ?
i was not saying a word .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m done with whatever this is that you &apos;re doing .
i have to go meet the martha stewart queen
and hear his party pitch .
just remember ,
at 3 : 00 , the twins have their spray tans .
well , that &apos;s exactly how i envisioned that .
let me see what you &apos;re drawing , johnny .
a rat with a civil war hat .
is that your comment on how politicians view soldiers ?
no , it &apos;s an actual rat i saw wearing a hat .
see , when you tend bar till 4 : 00 a.m. ,
you see a lot of weird stuff .
and when you waitress till 2 : 00,
you see a loser drawing a rat on a napkin .
now sign it , please .
you realize my art won &apos;t be worth anything till i &apos;m dead ?
why do you think i keep inviting you here to eat week after week ?
question ...
how does it feel to be the owner
of an original piece of napkin art worth roughly ...
less than the worth of the napkin ?
well , i got to get back to work .
okay , bye .
pick up ... table ten .
i watch you over there .
much sexual tension with deadbeat bartender .
he &apos;s not just a bartender . he &apos;s a street artist .
and all i did was bite a piece of celery .
when i think of all the times i asked you to bite my celery ...
and nothing .
okay , my side work &apos;s done , and my tables are all caught up .
so , tell me , did you give peach the card ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
why ?
it was like my mouth wouldn &apos;t let me do it .
that &apos;s crazy .
what &apos;s so hard about going up to peach
and saying , &quot; good afternoon , peach . &quot;
&quot; exciting news ... i started a cupcake business . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s our card . &quot;
&quot; please pass them out to all your friends ,
and help us launch our exciting new business venture . &quot;
&quot; thank you . &quot;
that sounds needy ,
like when someone asks you to come to their one @-@ woman show .
&quot; somebody date @-@ raped me ,
and i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d live through it ,
but i did , and now i &apos;m stronger ,
and , uh , still needy . &quot;
there is nothing needy about having a quality product
and wanting it out there .
look at earl ... he has a cd on display .
yeah , but he &apos;s cool about it .
he doesn &apos;t get all late @-@ night infomercial
and shove them down people &apos;s throats .
earl ?
how many cds have you sold at the diner ?
well , in this current economy ...
it &apos;s been pretty light .
may i ?
mm @-@ hmm .
hi .
you guys look like music lovers .
this is the best saxophone cd you will ever hear ...
recorded by our cashier earl samson .
he &apos;s played with all the greats ...
coltrane , hancock , even bacharach .
his music career derailed due to a heroin addiction ,
but now he &apos;s clean and sober
and , at 83 , still following his dream .
only $ 9.95 a copy . who &apos;d like one ?
thank you !
earl , four cds .
is any of that true ?
nope . she even made up my damn last name .
that girl can sell .
oh ! max ...
will you come look at brangelina ?
i think the spray @-@ tan lady went a little too far .
i wanted them to look tan , not foreign .
they look fine .
a little lebanese ,
but that &apos;ll clear up in a day or two .
i &apos;m having the worst day .
jessica seinfeld stole the martha stewart boy .
i am so upset with her .
i thought we were pretending to be friends .
and now i have no one to do the desserts .
hello , peach , exciting news ...
i have a cupcake business . they &apos;re really good .
give these to your friends and help launch
a new business or whatever .
that &apos;s it . i did it . boom !
okay , the bed still isn &apos;t built .
but the mattress came , and it &apos;s so good .
oh , no ... this is not okay .
we &apos;re not keeping a mattress on the floor .
we &apos;re poor , not crackheads .
and you tricked me .
i did my part , so you better get this bed done .
max , you gave peach the cards .
i &apos;m so proud of you . what did she say ?
no . shut it . do it .
relax . the bed will be assembled
and hidden in the wall by the end of the day ,
&apos;cause i decided to do what cute girls
have been doing for centuries .
i asked a guy for help .
you called a guy ?
oh , is he going to climb up your long blonde hair
and rescue you from your murphy @-@ bed tower ?
wait . you don &apos;t know any guys .
who did you invite ?
johnny .
no . no , no , no , no .
eh , i don &apos;t want to see johnny .
i had a weird thing with him at the diner last night .
i thought you guys were friends .
i don &apos;t know what we are .
he was fake interviewing me with a celery stalk ...
&apos;cause you &apos;re both grown @-@ ups .
and when he put it near my mouth ,
i thought he wanted me to bite it , so i ...
you bit it ?
i bit it !
that is weird and humiliating and hot .
yes , yes , and , yes . call him right now !
he can &apos;t come over here . look around !
i have his napkins hanging up everywhere .
he &apos;ll think i &apos;m dexter .
don &apos;t answer that .
don &apos;t you ...
come on in , johnny .
yes , i did it . i need a bed .
you are so selfish !
yes , i &apos;m selfish , and you &apos;re dexter .
so , quick ... help me take down the napkins .
oh , god , there are so many !
how come i never noticed how many there were before ?
i don &apos;t know . same reason you didn &apos;t notice
your father stealing everybody &apos;s money .
really ? really ? now when i &apos;m helping you ?
you &apos;re right . we &apos;ll trash you later .
why don &apos;t you just ask him what the celery moment meant ?
i don &apos;t want to ask him .
you don &apos;t want to ask anybody anything .
it &apos;s not like the business cards .
what am i going to say ?
&quot; good afternoon , johnny . &quot;
&quot; exciting news ... i have started
an oddly sexual celery @-@ biting business . &quot;
be right there , johnny !
yo .
so i brought tools ... per your request ...
and beer , i made an executive decision on .
so that &apos;s what you do with my art .
just one , and i put it up there .
she doesn &apos;t even like it ... she &apos;s like ,
&quot; why would anyone hang up stupid napkin art ? &quot;
right off my back .
had a couple of these on the subway .
so here &apos;s the wood .
you can &apos;t help her ...
she needs to learn a lesson about doing things for herself .
she thinks we &apos;re her daddy , and we &apos;ll go back on our word ,
and she &apos;ll get a pony .
well , you can see why she &apos;d think that .
i &apos;m going to see if the horse wants a beer .
hmm , maybe put my glasses on him ...
get crazy up in this piece !
when you &apos;re out there , ask him what the celery meant .
get busy , princess . daddy &apos;s got company .
well , little lady , i reckon a cowboy &apos;d get used to
a pretty sweet setup like this .
it &apos;s a hard life out on the trails .
yeah , it &apos;s hard for my people , too ,
since you stole all our land
and gave us blankets covered in smallpox .
i do declare ,
i &apos;m sorry for the disease blankets .
but they did keep you warm , i bet ,
until they killed you , that is .
&quot; i do declare &quot; is not cowboy .
that &apos;s southern belle .
i think you &apos;re looking for &quot; darn tootin &apos; &quot;
or &quot; dag nab it . &quot;
cowboys did not say &quot; dag nab it . &quot;
yeah , they did .
&quot; someone done gone stole my horse , dag nab it . &quot;
i think you &apos;re thinking &quot; doggone it . &quot;
no , &quot; dag nab it ... &quot; cowboy .
do you really think you know cowboy better than me ?
which one of us has a horse ?
which one of us has assless chaps ?
should i go inside and help caroline ?
no . i &apos;m sure she &apos;s doing just fine .
can i ask you something ?
sure .
when you put the sss ...
we should get on the horse !
okay .
yeah !
use three @-@ inch lag screw
to secure ledger board to wall studs
&quot; aboot &quot; every 12 inches .
ooh ! your canadian voice is so dull ,
i can &apos;t understand a word you &apos;re saying .
there &apos;s got to be a video with a better voice .
&quot; how to build a murphy bed ... morgan freeman . &quot;
interesting bit of information about horses ...
they hurt your balls .
yeah , mine hurt , too .
you would think after all these years of riding a horse ,
man would have evolved to have his balls on top
instead of underneath .
life would be so much easier .
well , yeah , but i don &apos;t see a lot of old @-@ timey ladies
wanting to get with the top balls .
are you thinking about the celery ?
no , i &apos;m still thinking about my balls .
now i &apos;m thinking about the celery .
that was weird , right ?
not weird , really ... more , um , intense .
intense good or intense bad ?
intense intense .
whoo .
whoa . oh . did i just grab your ...
yeah , i don &apos;t know . &quot; maybly . &quot;
&quot; maybly &quot; ! that &apos;s not a word , right ?
we should ...
i got to get down .
me too .
my balls .
so take your makeup brush , take your mirror ,
and you want to comb your eyebrows upwards .
what are you doing ?
okay , okay .
i thought i typed in &quot; morgan freeman . &quot;
but i &apos;m so tired , what came up was &quot; more gay men &quot; &quot;
but this damon guy is a genius .
if he had a video on how to build a murphy bed ,
it &apos;d already be done .
wait . where &apos;s johnny ?
what happened ? did you ask him ?
no , he left .
out the back ?
yeah , it got even weirder .
he grabbed my boob .
or ... he didn &apos;t grab my ...
he grabbed my boob .
i just don &apos;t know whether it was on purpose .
but i asked , like you told me to ,
and now i have a weird boob moment
to go with my weird celery moment .
that is very complicated .
but i &apos;m great with relationship stuff .
so come on over here , and we &apos;ll hammer it all out
while we hammer this all out .
come on , this is where you break down
and finally help me build the bed .
no , this is where i go to my already @-@ built bed .
and after peaches today and ...
whatever that was out there with my boob ,
i &apos;m not showing anyone my cards anymore ...
business or personal .
go in !
go in ! oh !
what is happening out here ?
that &apos;s the kind of pounding that &apos;s supposed to happen
after you &apos;re in the bed .
i can &apos;t do it .
i tried . i really did , but i can &apos;t .
i guess i can &apos;t do anything without my father &apos;s money .
you were right .
trying is embarrassing .
so i &apos;m not going to try anymore .
i &apos;m sick of it .
i &apos;m going to sleep on that horrible couch
and get bad tips and cry
every waitress day for the rest of my life .
daddy , please .
god , you &apos;re a baby .
okay , i &apos;ll help you ... this one time only .
and we &apos;re not going to bond when we do it .
we &apos;re not going to high @-@ five when we finish .
and i don &apos;t want to hear two months from now ,
&quot; hey , remember that night we built the murphy bed ?
that was awesome . &quot; none of that . got it ?
we need the power drill ,
1 / 4 @-@ inch bit , some masonry screws ,
and a bear claw .
now delete &quot; eyebrows , &quot;
type in &quot; murphy bed , &quot; and let &apos;s build this mother .
i can &apos;t believe we did it .
yeah , it looks pretty good .
oh , max .
you put the bakery up on your vision
beam .
say anything more , and i &apos;ll take it down .
do you know this number ?
that &apos;s peach .
why would she call you ?
it &apos;s about the cupcake business ...
my number &apos;s on the card .
put it on speaker .
hello ?
i found your card in my baby &apos;s room .
i have no idea who you are or how it got there ,
but i &apos;m throwing a birthday party in a week ,
and i thought cupcakes might be fun .
oh , they are .
people love cupcakes .
they bring a sense of whimsy and nostalgia .
that &apos;s enough .
why don &apos;t you tell me
some of the other events you &apos;ve done ?
oh , well , we &apos;re a start @-@ up company .
oh , no , i need a real business .
bye @-@ bye .
well , there you go ...
complete waste of our time .
see ? trying is embarrassing .
no . that was great , incredible .
what ? she hung up on you .
yes . but it proves one thing .
the cards ... they worked !
this is so inspiring .
first we build a murphy bed , next a cupcake business ,
then , max ...
who knows what else ?
uh , adjust the springs ?
