perfect enamel layer .
no deterioration of abutting gingiva .
english .
she &apos;s a flosser .
no witnesses .
not that many cars use this overpass .
but frankie found this .
1960s , chrysler , 300f .
wedge engine .
it &apos;s , uh , distinctive and pleasing .
yeah , it &apos;s from the suspect &apos;s car .
you &apos;re never gonna make homicide .
you keep jumping to conclusions like that , all right ?
you don &apos;t know where this came from .
get me everything you can , all right ?
he looks up to you .
you &apos;re an only child . get yourself a brother ,
and we &apos;ll talk .
hey , can i borrow your radio ? !
thanks a lot .
i mean , yes , all right ,
i would like to help him make homicide detective .
but he &apos;s just ... he &apos;s not ready .
you are deceptively complex . i do not understand you .
well , you would if i was a dead body .
do you think so ?
victor 825 , i got a full notifications .
i got one full notifications down here at revere park .
do you think it was deliberate ?
well , somebody knew we were here .
i &apos;d say they want to play ball .
korsak , you okay ?
aced your sergeant &apos;s exam . that &apos;s great .
save it . passed me over . again .
it &apos;s juice . i don &apos;t got juice .
no , no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s political , all right ?
how do you think i feel ?
they didn &apos;t even let women in this unit till 1988 .
more people to get promoted ahead of me -- great !
get up , get up , get up , get up .
drug unit has more space .
no , this is okay .
uh , lieutenant &apos;s office is through there ,
empty since ray was promoted .
you lost , joey ?
can i talk to you for a second , detective rizzoli ?
yeah , why not ?
what do you want ?
okay , look .
i know you &apos;ve got a problem with me .
&quot; the habitual difficulty in prayer is ,
&quot; &apos; a , &apos; distraction , &apos; b , &apos; lack of grace ,
&apos;c , &apos; selfishness , or , &apos; d , &apos; dryness . &quot;
dryness .
no . you still don &apos;t know .
you cheated off my catechism test .
we were 8 years old . and , no , i didn &apos;t .
yes , you did . and i know it was you who put a mallard duck
in my locker in 7th grade .
you don &apos;t like cold duck ?
it crapped all over my math homework .
no , not so much .
you and i are gonna have to figure out some way to get along .
why ?
because i &apos;m your new lieutenant .
commissioner gave me homicide command .
right . &apos; cause you &apos;ve got juice .
and i might have kissed a little brass on the way up .
but i also made hundreds of cases .
korsak &apos;s made thousands . he didn &apos;t get promoted .
korsak is sitting at that desk for a reason .
the same reason you &apos;ll be sitting there in 20 years .
you don &apos;t know how to get along .
me -- i &apos;ll barely have time for a cup of coffee
before i &apos;m out of that office and moving on up .
good .
you know , you &apos;re exactly the same .
and i &apos;m gonna need everything you got on that strangling victim .
yes , sir . lieutenant , sir .
that &apos;s strike one , rizzoli .
you got two left .
ladies and gentlemen ...
... i am your new lieutenant .
i just want to say i &apos;m very excited to be working with all of you .
i keep an open @-@ door policy .
let &apos;s make this a tight @-@ knit team .
oh , and ...
there will be no more parking in front of the building .
oh , come on .
it &apos;s a security .
4 @-@ inch curvilinear contusion .
see the patterned abrasions ?
mm @-@ hmm . from the terry cloth .
he didn &apos;t use his hands , so she was clutching at the ligature ,
fighting for her life .
it takes 20 to 30 seconds to render someone unconscious .
one , postmortem trauma ... two , postmortem trauma ...
no , i got it . strangling sucks . - three , postmortem --
depends who you &apos;re choking . can you believe that ?
i get kicked to the curb , grant gets the brass ring .
well , he &apos;s a -- a legend in the drug unit .
perhaps he &apos;s a little nicer off the mound .
oh , yeah , he &apos;s fantastic . i want to kill myself .
what &apos;s the best way ?
uh , atlanto @-@ occipital disarticulation is very fast .
no idea what that is . what else you got ?
i miss anything ?
we were just about to start the &quot; y &quot; incision .
oh , goody .
gore never bothered me .
my first autopsy was a burn victim ,
hands curled up like this .
guys thought i &apos;d turn into a little girl .
grabbed the fingers ,
looking for some skin to rehydrate and get a print .
snapped off , like pretzels .
knock it off , korsak .
sink .
you hungry , frost ? huh ?
you want to grab a tomato soup .
you want to know what i &apos;m thinking ?
it &apos;s so weird . i do .
i &apos;m thinking i know why you &apos;re making such a big deal
out of the fact that grant &apos;s your new boss .
i don &apos;t want to know what you &apos;re thinking .
you two like each other .
no .
do you know what that ass used to call me ? frog face .
it &apos;s not funny , maura . it &apos;s -- no .
it &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;m not a frog face .
no .
you know , i have an hour to finish this
before dinner with my hot new guy .
oh , my god . it &apos;s gnocchi night .
listen . um , i &apos;ll call you .
later , okay ?
... 14 home runs .
got this one . chopped it towards second .
could be two ...
can you believe this ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
who invited you ?
nice to see you , too .
hi , daddy . mwah .
hi , honey .
hello , jo friday . hello .
yes , i know . come on , swing !
don &apos;t let that dog lick you . it &apos;s unsanitary .
so , i hear you got a pinch hitter tossed into your game .
yeah , frankie told you about the strangling victim .
okay , that &apos;s not dinner talk .
we &apos;re not eating .
we &apos;re not eating , ma .
by the way , you &apos;re the one who wanted to learn
how to make grandma &apos;s gnocchi .
okay , okay . i &apos;m coming .
aw , come on , ma .
you didn &apos;t put the potato peels down the garbage disposal .
come on .
well , if you were home a little more ,
i would have known not to do that .
oh , come on ! tag him !
aw , dad , can we get a little help , please ?
yeah , what &apos;s the problem ?
you &apos;re always working . that &apos;s the problem .
ang , come on . leave her alone .
janie , where are the tools ?
uh , in the hall closet .
frankie , give me a hand over here , all right ?
yeah ?
okay .
thank you , daddy .
daddy needs help .
dad , what do you need ?
what did you say ?
what ?
nothing . everything &apos;s okay .
he needs frankie jr. to take over the business .
i mean , frankie belongs at rizzoli and sons ,
not out on the streets .
he &apos;s not a homeless person . he &apos;s a cop , ma .
just point out to him all the things you &apos;ve missed , okay ?
he listens to you .
the things i -- w @-@ what have i missed ?
what , a clogged sink ?
no , like ... children who love you .
a husband who adores you .
damn it . ang , why did you do this ?
okay , did i know that you couldn &apos;t put the potatoes in the sink ?
just fix it . you know how to do that .
well , next time , think .
okay , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll do that . i &apos;ll think .
frankie needs a wife .
why ? he has you .
no ! no , you &apos;re not -- - no , no .
rizzoli .
yeah . all right , i &apos;ll be right there .
did you catch another homicide ?
none of your business . fix my sink .
okay , princess .
hmm . he tucked her in .
when &apos;s the last time we had two stranglings in one day ?
well , cheer up . maybe tomorrow will be stabbing day .
i don &apos;t -- i @-@ i don &apos;t like this .
it &apos;s the same m.o. as the softball girl .
sophie clark -- 22 .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m working . it &apos;s my sector .
since when ?
since i asked for a new sector .
i want to learn from the best .
so , where is korsak ?
that &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s great .
you like that ?
yeah .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
rizzoli .
okay , thanks .
we &apos;ve got an i.d. on the first victim .
mary sullivan , sophie ... clark .
that &apos;s weird .
uh , run it again .
check the cold case database .
why ?
just do it .
oh , wow , sophie clark ...
was a victim of the boston strangler , 1962 .
he got mary mullivan in &apos; 64 .
yeah , we got him in &apos; 67 --
albert desalvo .
he confessed to all 13 of the murders .
he died in prison in ...
uh , &apos; 73 . stabbed by an inmate .
rizzoli , think .
we got two new stranglings -- same names .
it &apos;s a bizarre coincidence . or we &apos;ve got a copycat .
no .
some veteran cops never believed
desalvo was the boston strangler .
yeah , lots of cops do .
so why is it a cold case ?
an open homicide investigation , jane .
never solved .
come on . what are you telling me ?
that the boston strangler is back ?
i was 10 when it started .
the city went bonkers -- panic like you &apos;ve never seen .
yeah , probably because women were being strangled
in their own apartments from &apos; 62 to &apos; 64 .
and the boston cops couldn &apos;t catch him .
people don &apos;t like that . my mom still talks about it .
people were furious with the cops .
the bosses would have done anything
to get the public off their backs .
it was like jack the ripper found boston .
yeah , you &apos;re forgetting one thing --
desalvo confessed .
because he loved the attention .
told you -- banana head .
all right , then how did he know details ?
you know , the apartment layouts ,
the way the bodies were strangled .
read his interviews .
he was a serial rapist in and out of the clink .
shared a cell with the real strangler is what some think .
korsak , it &apos;s been 40 years .
even if the &quot; real &quot; strangler has been behind bars
and he just got paroled , he &apos;d -- he &apos;d be in his 60s .
hey , mick jagger &apos;s in his 60s .
oh , well , that &apos;s our first suspect .
i was a little disappointed when i moved to boston
后因出现在朗费罗的诗中而得以传颂
and found out that paul revere
didn &apos;t actually do the midnight ride .
oh , yeah , yeah . i know what you mean .
i mean , i understand -- longfellow couldn &apos;t write ,
作品 《 保罗 · 保维尔的夜奔 》
&quot; listen , my children , and you shall hear
the midnight ride of william ... dawes . &quot;
still .
is there anything that you don &apos;t know ?
of course .
i read an article about the initial plasma state ,
uh , that followed the big bang .
and the universe was at its highest level of entropy ,
which was ... fascinating , and you don &apos;t really care .
i ... i like science .
no apologies . i like you .
your skin is a little ... rough .
oh . i &apos;m sorry . i shaved .
abnormal joint flexibility .
i would be happy to show you that later .
do you have flat feet ?
that &apos;s really second @-@ date material ,
but ... yeah .
oh . shoot .
nearsighted ?
yeah . why ?
marfan syndrome .
yeah , it explains the dolichostenomelia .
excuse me . the doli @-@ what ?
dolichostenomelia .
sorry , e @-@ elongated limbs .
you &apos;re suffering from a genetic disorder of the connective tissue .
it &apos;s called marfan syndrome .
if this is your idea of foreplay , it &apos;s not working .
no , it -- the heart damage is the biggest issue .
but life expectancy has increased considerably .
what ?
nate -- wait , i &apos;m ...
nate , nate , why are you -- where are you going ?
call my doctor . good night .
well , i didn &apos;t believe it either .
but then i went through the evidence , all right ?
the strangler had a signature way
of tying the ligatures into a bow .
yeah , but that &apos;s all public record .
no , no , no , not this detail . that was never released .
so , what are you telling me ?
are you telling me that , more than 40 years
after the boston strangler stopped killing , the -- the guy &apos;s back ?
well , maybe . yeah .
how is that possible , detective ? he &apos;s dead .
no . no . desalvo , the guy who confessed , is dead .
what if , this whole time , the real boston strangler
has been behind bars and now he &apos;s out ?
we -- track the timeline . look , okay .
the killings stopped after desalvo was locked up , right ?
they start up again two days ago .
no . i @-@ it &apos;s a different guy .
it &apos;s the same m.o.
he -- he -- he goes after women who live alone .
there &apos;s no sign of forced entry ,
so he either knows them ,
or he talks his way in .
i mean , come on , he &apos;s picking victims
with the same names as the boston strangler .
i mean , this guy &apos;s practically yelling , &quot; i &apos;m back ! &quot;
we -- we got to find these women .
we got to warn them .
no , we don &apos;t .
okay , it &apos;s not gonna happen .
two words i do not want to hear together again --
&quot; boston &quot; and &quot; strangler . &quot;
that case nearly buried this city .
so ... i ignore the obvious links ?
i am telling you that these new murders
have nothing to do with the boston strangler .
if you want to work here , solve them .
you know , i remember you
when you cared more about the people than the politics .
what did you bring me down here for ?
we &apos;re gonna crack this case .
in the basement ?
know what &apos;s up there ?
yes , that is where i take my naps .
all the old files of the boston strangler case .
i thought those were locked away in a vault somewhere .
even better .
they misfiled the evidence on purpose .
here , hold the light . i &apos;ll get a ladder .
we &apos;ll get them down .
hey , listen to this . desalvo wrote a poem .
&quot; people everywhere are still in doubt .
is the strangler in prison or roaming about ? &quot;
o &apos;malley ?
worked with him .
died of a heart attack at 40 .
fitzgerald -- great cop .
shot his wife , then himself .
this case ... killed a lot of good men , good careers .
gee , i can &apos;t wait to dive in .
leahy .
i forgot about him . i know where to find him .
come on . he &apos;s a great guy .
w @-@ wait , i @-@ i @-@ i want maura to look at some of this .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to smuggle it out , then .
you don &apos;t need this . give me this .
kenny .
vince korsak .
korsak .
kid , you haven &apos;t aged very good .
oh , you look the same .
mind if we join you ?
this is detective rizzoli .
hello .
detective , huh ?
i heard they was putting girls on the job .
yeah , they even let us drive our own cars .
i &apos;m familiar with the great work you did on the strangler case .
the boston strangler , huh ?
case ruined my life .
cost me my wife and kid .
they threw me out of homicide .
detective , what if you were right ?
what is albert desalvo really wasn &apos;t the boston strangler ,
like you were trying to tell everybody ?
it doesn &apos;t make much difference what i thought .
but you thought they had the wrong guy .
they did .
and if he &apos;s alive , he &apos;s still out there .
detective , wait . look . you were once a good cop .
i &apos;m a good cop , even though i &apos;m a girl .
i @-@ if you -- if you think of anything , please give us a call .
good to see you , mac .
find anything ?
very sophisticated killer .
no forensic evidence so far on either victim .
uh @-@ oh , uh @-@ oh . sink . sink , sink , sink .
korsak &apos;s calling me b.b.k. -- barf bag kid .
crowe &apos;s leaving plastic puke everywhere .
you &apos;re not the first detective to be sickened by death .
you just have to find your morgue legs .
i read a study that said
people can conquer this kind of thing with repeated exposure .
like when you &apos;re afraid of dogs or flying .
oh . immersion therapy . very effective .
it worked for me .
what were you afraid of ?
people .
live ones .
she &apos;ll never judge me , tease me .
and i can help her .
i can speak for the dead .
come here .
come . right .
now we &apos;re just gonna --
we &apos;re gonna open her up .
we &apos;re gonna take a little looknside .
okay , now breathe deep .
actually , don &apos;t inhale .
just follow my finger .
whoa , look at you .
hey ... jane .
um ... thank you .
um ... i &apos;ll be upstairs .
well , no , i @-@ i don &apos;t want to interrupt .
no , it &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t want to get in your guys &apos; way .
what ?
you &apos;d want to know if you had marfan syndrome , wouldn &apos;t you ?
you did it again ?
i know . i know
ooh , cobalt blue slingback .
all right , look , come here .
take a few cuts off of this . it will make you feel better .
okay .
all right .
yeah .
all right . let &apos;s see it .
all right .
this is an optimum batting stance .
really , who says ? pee @-@ wee herman ?
it &apos;s classic rigid body collision theory ,
not pee @-@ wee herman .
no , fine .
fine , fine . you &apos;re ruining a national pastime .
what ? don &apos;t take my bat .
let go , let go .
look what i brought you -- presents .
from the evidence warehouse .
ooh . i like presents .
what do we have here ?
what ?
oh , darn it .
what ?
i thought it was an original mary quant .
i thought you found something useful .
well , miniskirts freed women .
they were practical and liberating .
can you get dna off of it ?
no .
no , it -- it &apos;s been handled by hundreds of people ,
and it wasn &apos;t stored properly .
well , we better come up with something ,
or there are gonna be a lot more women
with bows tied around their necks .
this -- this is helen blake .
okay . all right .
okay , and after that --
you said i wouldn &apos;t make a good detective .
that &apos;s not what i say .
all right , look -- we got 294 women
with the same last names as the other 11 victims
and we got to find a way to let them know --
open it up .
i took a bunch of photos the softball field
and -- and at your second vic &apos;s apartment .
and you &apos;re always saying that the killer
might try to sightsee in a crowd of ghouls , so ..
thank you . thank you so much .
all right .
thanks .
a @-@ aren &apos;t you even gonna look at them ?
can &apos;t right now . there &apos;s a strangler on the loose .
rizzoli !
hey , frankie . .
hey , come find me later . i need to talk to you .

the boston strangler &apos;s looking for her .
unh @-@ unh . i am setting up a task force .
from now on , everything in this case runs through me .
and i want updates from you every 10 minutes .
hey , they &apos;re towing your car , rizzoli .
what ?
told you not to park out front .
hi , sorry . excuse me .

yes , they are .
what are you doing here ?
i , uh -- i asked around after read about the stranglings ,
and , uh , well , the word is that you &apos;re a good cop .
i thought maybe you could use this .
this is your personal file .
yeah , can you believe i kept it all these years ?
it &apos;s always eating at me , too .
you know , we all have that one case ,
you know , y @-@ you never really close ?

but you are a good cop .
how did you know ?
well , i spent 30 years working with a lot of bad ones .
tell me , uh , you married ?
no .
that &apos;s too bad .
uh , no , it &apos;s by choice .
why &apos;s that ?
because any man i could love
wouldn &apos;t want me doing this job .
and i love this job .

yeah , you do that .

put this one the wall . nice website .
really ? you can &apos;t bowl or collect ships in a bottle .
you &apos;ve got to do this for a hobby .
every detail of the new strangling victims
is on this guy &apos;s blog .
boston police . open up .
clear .
get up ! stand up ! get up ! hands all the way up !
up against the wall !
get on the bed !
oh , we got a live one .
i &apos;m curious why you at the crime scenes ?
you like strangling , sandy ?
my name &apos;s dr. k , yo .
me and dr. kevorkian are death enthusiasts .
ain &apos;t nothing illegal about that .
interference with a police officer during performance of duty is .
hey , if i confess ,
can i look at the bodies you got in the morgue ?
rizzoli , we &apos;ve got a third victim .
liver temp indicates she died within the last hour .
so it &apos;s not our &quot; death enthusiast . &quot;
well , at least he &apos;s not blogging .
thanks for pointing out the bright side .
researchers at the university of pittsburgh
have proven that optimistic people live longer .
so she was a pessimist ?
joanne graff -- 29 .
a joanne graff was strangled in 1962 ...
by the boston strangler .
maura .
what do you see ?
a reddish @-@ brown stain .
in other words , blood .
no , a reddish @-@ brownish stain .
the crime lab will determine what it is .
no signs of lacerations or abrasions on the victim .
so it &apos;s not hers ,
which means we might have gotten lucky
and the killer was bleeding .
or smearing reddish @-@ brownish stuff .
thanks .
red &apos;s car has been located .
towing it to evidence now .
see ?
you just got to remain optimistic .
hey , move that to evidence !
you can &apos;t park there , rizzoli .
move that to an evidence bay .
i can &apos;t . they &apos;re all full .
oh , really ?
you &apos;re just gonna keep your car parked right there , huh ?
me and the batmobile , we &apos;re gonna stay right here .
oh , come on .
oh , come on , damn it ! stop !
you got your evidence , rizzoli .
damn it !
not now , maura . i &apos;m in a bad mood .
what ?
maura , what &apos;s up ?
great news --
we got hit on the blood you found on the second victim &apos;s blouse .
who does it belong to ?
redmond jones .
guys , i think we just found the boston strangler .
we should let lieutenant grant know .
let &apos;s bring this sucker home .
rizzoli , hey .
the task force will take it from here .
y @-@ you can &apos;t do that . it &apos;s my case .
well , you &apos;re part of the task force .
come along if you like .
yeah . come along . it &apos;ll be fun .
he asked me , janie .
you &apos;re squeezing the orange , huh , frankie ?
you getting some juice ?
that &apos;s a fast way to make detective .
grant put me on the task force .
what do you want me to do ? say no ?
yeah , frankie !
mom ?
dad ? hi , daddy .
janie , you okay ?
yeah .
you sure ?
yeah , yeah , yeah . hi .
what are you doing here ?
what do you mean , what am i doing here ?
frankie said they towed your car away and you needed a lift .
hey , he &apos;s gonna make his first big arrest , you know .
yeah , i know . that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
i know .
listen , um , daddy how come you never asked me
to be a part of rizzoli and sons ?
well , now you want to be a plumber ?
no -- no , i just -- i don &apos;t understand
why all of a sudden you want frankie
to take over the family business .
frankie jr . ? !
you two kids were never interested in the business .
are you all right ?
yeah , yeah , yeah , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m fine .
all right , i &apos;ll see you at home .
okay .
all right , guys , way to go !
i heard . i &apos;m sorry .
you should have seen him , grant and his task force ,
everybody celebrating -- it was a joke .
just -- we get one body dropped in our laps .
we have two stranglings in one day .
we have no forensic evidence , and then -- bam !
we find blood
maura says forensic evidence doesn &apos;t waver ,
doesn &apos;t lie , doesn &apos;t change its mind .
hey , frost ,
did redmond jones have any blood work done recently ,
any doctor visits ?
no , not that i could find .
i &apos;m gonna check something .
he &apos;s sharing a cell with this guy redmond jones .
well , redmond jones tells him the whole story ,
all these girls that he strangled .
desalvo &apos;s such a nutcake ,
he begins telling people it &apos;s him ,
the boston strangler &apos;s him .
excuse me . detective leahy ?
oh , hey . you &apos;re , uh , dr . isles .
i am . it &apos;s -- it &apos;s nice to meet you .
how are you ?
do you have a minute ?
why ? what &apos;s up , doc ?
go to the one on boylston street ,
across from the common .
there &apos;s a dialysis center there .
yesterday , 2 : 00 .
i checked the clearance records ,
showed kenny &apos;s photo around . the alibi &apos;s solid .
i can &apos;t explain it . it &apos;s a gut thing .
understood .
freeze . blow that up .
there he is going in .
shuttle forward .
stop . blow that up .
five minutes later . how long does dialysis take ?
couple hours .
that is a good alibi .
how many dialysis appointments have you missed ?
none .
every other day , i &apos;m in dialysis for hours .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s possible .
you &apos;re exhibiting signs of renal failure .
i &apos;m gonna go call your doctor .
hey , doc .
what are you doing ?
you can &apos;t stop talking , can you ?
you know why you did it , detective ?
yeah , i was in a bad mood , okay ?
you have an obsession disorder .
you identified with the aggressor ,
the boston strangler , and you became him .
shut up . just -- - &apos; cause i can get help --
shut up !
the real killer is redmond jones . you understand ?
redmond jones is the boston strangler .
he &apos;s getting what he should have gotten 40 years ago .
i made sure of that .
by murdering three more women and framing him .
hey , maura .
check it out . can you run this ...
blood .
you are a good cop .
for a girl .
all right , your gun -- put it down . kick it over there .
don &apos;t do it , jane .
oh , shut the hell up !
put the gun down .
put it down . slow .
all right , now kick it over there .
you planted redmond jones &apos; blood , didn &apos;t you ?
i still got some .
home run .
no . just a base hit .
you okay ?
yeah . yeah .
hey , did you ever talk to marfan man ?
mm @-@ hmm . he called to thank me .
he found a specialist --
an international expert , actually .
really ? are you gonna see him again ?
i don &apos;t date patients .
you don &apos;t want to go out with him
&apos;cause he &apos;s got some weird @-@ ass disease .
his limbs are a little spidery .
come on . but that is not the only reason .
come on . you got to stop that .
you got to stop diagnosing people .
can we just talk about your love life .
okay .
um ... i date two kinds --
the kind that hates that i &apos;m a cop .
and the kind that wants me to use the handcuffs .
okay , watch this . ready ?
3 , 2 , 1 .
shabow .
see ya .
that was fast .
&quot; i &apos;m smiling . i like handcfs . &quot;
all right .
see ?
so ... who do you think the original boston strangler was ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll ever know .
good job , rizzoli .
while kenny was trying to kill dr. oz over here ,
i was looking for you so you could have that arrest , too .
i owe you a massive apology .
and ... i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , i can tell from the nasty face you &apos;re making .
oh , that &apos;s not because of you , jane .
he has bullous lesions .
i have what ?
blisters .
how did you know that ?
you were limping .
right . i was limping . can i sit down ?
no .
yes .
we didn &apos;t have to wear big @-@ boy shoes in the drug unit .
you &apos;re not gonna take those off in here ?
no . i &apos;m not .
well , i can take a look at your bullous lesions if you would like me to .
maura , come on !
i &apos;m just saying .
anyway , i just wanted to say that i &apos;m sorry
we got off to such a bad start on our first case .
and i wasn &apos;t cheating off you on our catechism test .

but i wasn &apos;t looking at your paper .
see you soon .
