you must be elena .
we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
is that the moon curse ? klaus is the real deal .
from the first generation of vampires .
the oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me ?
elijah . one of the originals .
he &apos;s a legend . aah !
so that &apos;s it .
as long as we keep the dagger in there ,
then he stays dead .
elijah had no weapon to kill klaus .
but he believed that if a witch could channel enough power ,
it wouldn &apos;t need one .
like the power you get from a spot
marked with a hundred dead witches .
says if you use too much of your powers at once , it &apos;ll kill you .
how much would it take to kill an original ?
all of it .
i &apos;m a vampire .
i don &apos;t want to know this ! tell me what i can do .
i drank that vervain stuff and then asked her to take it away .
i want you to tell me everything she said .
i found my way to someone in his trusted circle .
one of klaus &apos; witches .
he &apos;s all yours .
i have katherine and the moonstone .
klaus has everything he needs for now .
alaric ?
katerina , i &apos;ve missed you .
klaus !
oh ! who is this guy , safari sam ?
ok , bad ,
or badder ?
the dark colors suit you better .
oh , thank you , honey .
ok , pop quiz .
the dagger and white ash
are in the salvatores possession , correct ?
the dagger was used to kill elijah .
you &apos;ll find him in the basement of the salvatore house .
ok , that dagger needs to stay exactly where it is .
the last thing i need to do is resurrect elijah .
ohh , that guy is a buzz kill .
don &apos;t forget you &apos;re on the outs with your girlfriend jenna .
right . elena &apos;s aunt . for all the lies about isobel .
what else ?
that &apos;s it .
oh , so jumpy .
please , just ... kill me .
i &apos;ve told you everything that i know .
you see , i believe that you believe that .
but what would you not know ?
what could they be keeping from you ? hmm ?
anything ?
tell me .
they were trying to see if bonnie could find a way
to kill an original without a dagger .
bonnie the best friend ?
and then you said she didn &apos;t have her powers anymore .
she doesn &apos;t .
or didn &apos;t . i don &apos;t know .
you kidnapped me , remember ? i &apos;m kinda out of the loop .
well , we &apos;ll have to get to the bottom of that .
please , just kill me , klaus , and be done with it .
and show you kindness ?
i &apos;ve searched for you for over 500 years .
your death is going to last
at least half that long .
i want you to take this knife ...
and stab yourself .
now take it out . ahhh !
now while i &apos;m gone , i want you to do that
over and over and over again .
and if you get bored ,
switch legs .
where are you going ?
i &apos;m gonna go lay eyes
on my precious doppelganger .
oh , don &apos;t look so glum , katerina .
the fun is just beginning .
again , please .
please sign here
and here .
ok .
so this place is all yours ? they just gave it to you ?
for now .
as sole owner , i &apos;m the only one
who can invite a certain type of person
in here , if you know what i mean .
your own personal safe house .
that &apos;s the idea .
wouldn &apos;t want to clean it .
you really think bonnie can take on klaus ?
she said she could channel enough witch &apos;s power to kill him .
elijah thought that would work
and he was an original , so .
we just need to find him . yeah .
could she do one of those witch tracking spells ?
nope . not without something that belongs to klaus .
believe me , i already asked .
do you think he killed her ?
katherine ?
probably .
it &apos;s not like she didn &apos;t have it coming .
yeah .
thank you , mr. henry .
i &apos;m sorry . i completely forgot .
stefan .
would you like to come inside my house ?
i would love to . thank you .
what are we , 12 ?
one of us is .
if i let you in , do you promise
to obey the owner of this house ?
no .
seriously , damon .
my way . you promised .
i call the shots .
no lies , no secret agendas .
remember ?
yes , elena . sure .
then please , come in .
shut up .
thanks .
wait , where are you going ?
to school .
no , no , no .
we didn &apos;t create a safe house for you to leave it .
yeah , guys , klaus is out there .
we know that .
right .
but where ? no one knows .
look , i really appreciate what you guys are doing .
and i &apos;ll be able to sleep
at night knowing that i &apos;ll be safe here ,
but i &apos;m not going to be a prisoner .
your way , elena .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m ready .
if he shows his face , i can take him .
know how .
the way i see it , next to bonnie
is the safest place that i can be .
come on .
wait , um , coming .
caroline left early for school .
i know . i came to see you .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
what to say , how to act around her .
you can &apos;t let on that you know .
she wants me to take her to the dance .
what am i supposed to do ?
take her to the dance .
i &apos;ll never get away with it .
she knows me too well ,
she &apos;ll figure it out .
damn it , matt , just do it .
she &apos;s my daughter .
she &apos;s my baby . i just ,
i need some time .
i know , but--
look , if what caroline told you is true ,
she &apos;s not the only one .
the salvatores are vampires .
the gilbert family is in on it .
tyler lockwood is god knows what .
a werewolf .
there &apos;s no one in this town i can trust .
i just need to take a beat
and figure out what to do .
that &apos;ll never fool her .
yes , you will .
as far as she knows , you don &apos;t remember anything .
buy me some time .
please , matt .
hello , class .
what ... are we learning today ?
with the decade dance tonight ,
we &apos;ve been covering the sixties all week .
right .
the sixties .
the sixties .
i wish there was something good
i could say about the sixties .
actually , they kind of sucked .
except for the beatles , of course .
they made it bearable .
uh , what else was there ?
the cuban missile thing ,
the--we walked on the moon .
there was watergate .
watergate was the seventies , ric .
i @-@ i mean , mr saltzman .
right .
it all kind of mushes together up here ,
the sixties , seventies .
thank you , elena .
hey , dana .
hey .
um , can you take care of these ?
sure .
ok , thank you .
hey .
what was that for ?
just practicing for tonight .
so i ... found a suit .
if you still want me to be jfk .
perfect .
do you think elena knows what it &apos;s going to take
for you to do that klaus spell ?
no , and you &apos;re not , either .
well , she &apos;s gotta know you can &apos;t do it .
you don &apos;t know i can &apos;t .
have a little faith in me .
that &apos;s not fair .
you can &apos;t harness the power df a hundred dead witches .
it &apos;ll kill you .
shh ! we don &apos;t know that for certain .
you promised to keep my secret , i &apos;m trusting you .
i &apos;m going through with this ,
and if you tell anyone , i swear--
what ? what are you gonna do ?
hey , jer . how you doing ?
are you ok at the house alone with john ?
it &apos;s not ideal .
you haven &apos;t heard from jenna , have you ?
it looks like she &apos;s staying on campus .
i &apos;m late for class .
what &apos;s going on ?
i told him he had to dress up tonight
and he got all uptight .
hey , elena , there you are . ok .
this is going to sound freaky ,
but this totally hot guy just asked me to ask you
if you &apos;re going to the dance tonight .
tell him she has a boyfriend .
you could at least meet him . he &apos;ll be at the dance tonight .
look for him . his name is klaus .
i &apos;m sorry , what did you just say ?
his name &apos;s klaus .
i know the name &apos;s stupid , but i swear he &apos;s hot .
where is he ? is he here ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s being compelled .
but he wants to know if you &apos;ll save him the last dance .
how cute is that ?
so we go to the dance , we find him .
really ? how are we going to do that ?
we don &apos;t even know what he looks like .
something tells me he &apos;s not going to be 16 and pimply .
he could be anywhere at any time .
he compelled somebody at school .
i guess it &apos;s not as safe as you guys thought , huh ?
there you are .
sorry i &apos;m late .
hey , i need you to put me down
as a chaperone at the dance tonight .
klaus made his first move .
ok , so we find him and then what , hmm ?
what &apos;s our plan of attack ?
me .
i &apos;m the plan . he has no idea
how much power i can channel .
if you can find him , i can kill him .
that &apos;s not going to be that easy .
i mean , he is the biggest , baddest vampire around .
alaric has a point . i mean , what if he--
well , i was impressed .
it doesn &apos;t matter if he &apos;s an original .
i can take down anyone who comes at me .
i can kill him , elena .
i know i can .
ah , you &apos;re right .
this witch is all juiced up and aiming to kill .
that &apos;s terrible .
we &apos;re gonna have to kill her , maddox .
do you think this alaric guy has anything vintage ?
cross bows , wooden bullets and automatics ?
who is this guy , again ?
he &apos;s the local vampire hunter .
ahh . well , that explains the clothes .
all i could find . guy likes his bourbon .
i knew there was something about him i liked .
there &apos;s a high school dance
and i &apos;m gonna need you to take out the witch bitch .
if she has that much power ,
she can sense me coming from a mile away .
i won &apos;t be able to get near her . you have to do it .
in this body ? i &apos;m a haggard history teacher .
she can easily hurt me .
i mean , not me , klaus me ,
but you know what i mean .
no witch could handle
channeling that much power .
it &apos;ll kill her .
it would kill me .
you just have to make her use it .
you mean like provoking her to death ?
won &apos;t take long .
just keep attacking her until it kills her .
his body , alaric &apos;s ,
will last longer than hers will .
how ? he &apos;s human .
i can help in that department .
i can do a spell to protect you .
there you are !
you almost missed me .
how do i look ?
jackie o . ?
duh .
you look good .
thanks .
is everything ok ?
ughh , just some work stress .
well , you work too much .
mr. president .
sheriff .
sorry .
have fun .
we will .
bye .
bye .
your relatives were such packrats .
ok , so what do you think ?
twiggy or sexy hippy ?
you know it &apos;s not too late to back out , right ?
and what , miss out on all the fun ?
all this time spent worrying about klaus .
i think i convinced myself that he &apos;s not real .
but he is .
and tonight , we will put an end to him .
i love you .
i want you to tell me that when the night &apos;s over .
any time tonight .
nice outfit , mr. saltzman . totally far out .
thank you , dana . thank you .
now who is your date ?
it &apos;s chad , mr. saltzman , from third period .
chad , of course .
how would you and your friends like to earn a little extra credit ?
wait .
look , i , um , i want you to have this .
if you &apos;re asking me to go steady ,
i think that was the fifties .
no , i &apos;m serious , bonnie .
the ring won &apos;t work on me , jeremy .
but it was made by a witch .
to protect from the supernatural ,
not for someone who is .
well , i have to do something .
i can &apos;t just ... i can &apos;t just let you get yourself killed .
just because a bunch of dead witches gave me a warning
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m going to die .
so you &apos;re saying there &apos;s a 50 @-@ 50 shot you won &apos;t ?
look , i &apos;m sorry .
but ... you know i don &apos;t have the best luck
in the girlfriend department .
listen , i--
i can &apos;t explain it .
but i can feel them .
i &apos;m empowered , jeremy , i can do this .
i know i can .
i &apos;m strong enough .
damon .
evenin &apos; .
hey , you two .
oh , you look nice .
you , too .
you guys ready to do this ?
thanks for being here , everybody .
we have a special shout @-@ out tonight .
this is for elena .
from klaus .
that was a lame , cheap shot .
he &apos;s just trying to bait us .
i know everyone here .
maybe he &apos;s not here .
just wants us to believe that he is .
it &apos;s a party , people . blend .
let him come to us .
good idea .
no , no , i really don &apos;t feel like dancing .
too bad .
there &apos;s ric .
i &apos;ll be back .
special dedication , huh ?
this guy &apos;s a little twisted .
i &apos;m not impressed .
no ?
i mean , obviously he didn &apos;t do anything out of whack .
caroline &apos;s here . they don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
we have to tell her .
i &apos;m on it .
how you doing ?
um , freaking out a bit ?
you ?
cool as a cucumber .
come on , remember the last decade dance ?
the vampires were all , &quot; ahh ! &quot;
and you were all , &quot; aahh ! &quot;
right . and you won .
yes ! we did .
you &apos;re good at this .
i &apos;ve got moves you &apos;ve never seen .
dance with me .
i &apos;m a really bad dancer .
i know better than that .
what ?
you look really pretty tonight .
hey , guys .
hey , man , what &apos;s up ?
hey . do you mind if i steal your date for a moment ?
no , not all .
i &apos;ll get us something to drink .
thanks .
what &apos;s wrong ?
klaus is here .
what ? !
yeah .
where ?
we have no idea . but keep your eye out
for anything that might be weird , ok ?
may i ?
you heard jeremy and me talking , didn &apos;t you ?
is it true ?
yes .
the part about you having a 50 @-@ 50 shot of surviving ?
is that true ?
he was upset . i didn &apos;t want him to worry .
so you lay it out on the line for elena , no matter what .
no matter what .
good .
you can &apos;t tell her .
your secret &apos;s safe with me , but i mean ...
with all that power ,
isn &apos;t there a way to increase your odds ?
careful , damon .
i might start to think you actually care .
we wouldn &apos;t want that .
what are they up to ?
who knows ?
is there something going on , jer ? you ok ?
fine .
i &apos;m fine .
everything all right ?
i &apos;m not sure .
jeremy .
what are you doing ?
elena thinks we should stick together .
yeah , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;ve got my ring .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s bonnie .
what is it ?
you got something on your mind , spit it out .
if bonnie takes on klaus ,
channeling all that energy &apos;s going to kill her .
what ?
but she doesn &apos;t want elena to know ,
&apos;cause if elena knows ,
she &apos;s gonna try to stop her .
and it &apos;s elena that could turn up dead , so ...
what am i supposed to do ?
i need to talk to you .
come here , come here , come here .
please tell me you didn &apos;t know that
bonnie was on a suicide mission .
oh , great . jeremy told you ,
and of course you told elena .
yeah , i told her .
you promised her no more secrets .
i changed my mind .
how could you not tell me ?
cause i knew how &apos;d you react .
no .
no way , it &apos;s not an option .
it &apos;s our only option .
then we &apos;ll find another way , ok ?
bonnie , you &apos;re not dying to save my life .
i have the power to save you !
if i don &apos;t use it and something happens ,
that would kill me more .
i can &apos;t let you .
just answer one question--
if the situation was reversed ,
would you do it for me ?
so you know why i have to .
no .
no !
what &apos;s going on , guys ?
you ok , gilbert ? you don &apos;t look so good .
dude , seriously ?
wrong day , wrong guy .
let me guess--
klaus says hi .
no , no , no , no , don &apos;t kill him . he &apos;s compelled .
so ?
so , the whole thing &apos;s a distraction .
go find bonnie and elena .
i got this . go .
elena !
what is it ? he has jeremy .
what ? what ? !
yeah , klaus has jeremy . come on .
ok , so where are you taking us ?
just a little further .
wait ... something &apos;s not right .
where &apos;s jeremy ?
i just had to get away from that dance .
the sixties , uchh .
not my decade .
i mean , whose call was that , anyway ?
i much prefer the twenties .
the style , the parties ,
the jazz .
alaric .
are you on vervain ?
now why would you ask me that question , elena ?
he &apos;s being compelled .
nope . try again .
what &apos;s going on ?
ok , i &apos;ll give you a hint .
i am not alaric .
klaus .
surprise !
oh , no .
no , it &apos;s not possible .
just relax , elena .
i &apos;m not here to hurt you .
you &apos;re not on my hit list tonight .
but you are .
now , did i mention that i knew a witch ?
you &apos;re gonna have to hit me a lot harder than that .
by all means ... fire away !
if you kill this body ,
i &apos;ll just get a new one .
maybe jeremy .
go . run .
run !
what happened ?
klaus is in alaric &apos;s body .
what ?
he &apos;s possessing it or something .
go find stefan . now .
ok .
now .
can you kill him ?
he &apos;s got some kind of protection spell .
you have the power of a hundred witches .
break it .
i &apos;m trying !
if i kill alaric ,
he &apos;ll just possess someone else .
he knows i have my power , damon .
he &apos;s trying to kill me .
no .
klaus does not get to win tonight ,
no way .
you still willing to do whatever it takes to kill him ?
are you ok ?
um ... yeah .
i &apos;m just ... i &apos;m looking for stefan .
seriously , what &apos;s wrong ?
uh , just , um ,
stay with matt , ok ?
what was that about ?
oh , you know , just same old drama .
what took you so long ?
now , do you want to do this the easy way
or the hard way ?
the hard way . got it .
what ? you &apos;d kill your favorite history teacher ?
it &apos;s what alaric would want .
and he &apos;d want you to suffer first .
look at you .
is that all you got ?
let &apos;s find out .
there you are .
what are you doing ? where &apos;s bonnie ?
she &apos;s doing what she has to do .
what ? !
where is she ?
stefan , let her do this .
damn it , damon , where is she ? !
bonnie , no !
no !
bonnie , bonnie !
bonnie , bonnie , hey , hey !
stefan , she &apos;s not breathing !
stefan ! stefan ,
i can &apos;t find her pulse !
stefan ! do something , please !
stefan , please ! just give her blood , do something , please !
it &apos;s too late .
i &apos;m sorry .
no !
no .
no , no , no , no , no !
bonnie ! bonnie , please , no !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
stefan , get elena out of here .
i &apos;ll deal with this .
what do you mean , deal with this ?
the sheriff can &apos;t know about this .
last thing we need &apos;s another mysterious death .
it &apos;s bonnie !
get her home .
now .
klaus .
hey .
no . jeremy .
oh , my god , jeremy . what about jeremy ?
i &apos;ll find him .
no !
damon ! hey , i got your message ,
i can &apos;t find anyone .
where &apos;s elena , where &apos;s bonnie ?
we need to have a little talk .
here , drink this .
i can &apos;t .
yeah . yeah , you can .
please drink this .
this is my fault .
no , no , no , no , no .
no . hey .
this was klaus . listen to me .
klaus did this .
what did you do with her ? !
will you please calm her down ?
don &apos;t talk like i &apos;m not standing right in front of you .
please calm down .
you knew !
didn &apos;t you ? you knew that if she harnessed all that power ,
that she would die , didn &apos;t you ?
yes .
yes , i knew .
you need to listen to me ,
and prepare for what i &apos;m about to say .
bonnie had to die .
klaus using alaric &apos;s body was a total surprise .
she wasn &apos;t prepared for that .
and he wasn &apos;t going to stop ,
and we weren &apos;t going to be able to stop him
until he knew she was dead .
he had to believe it .
she cast a spell .
bonnie &apos;s ok .
you know , you could have told me .
how do i know when you &apos;re going
to go blabbing things to your girlfriend .
you even understand what you put her through ?
see , that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell you .
&apos;cause you would have never been able to do it .
don &apos;t get me wrong , stefan .
i don &apos;t mind being the bad guy .
i &apos;ll make all the life and death decisions
while you &apos;re busy worrying about collateral damage .
i &apos;ll even let her hate me for it .
but at the end of the day ,
i &apos;ll be the one to keep her alive .
you sure it &apos;s safe here ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
what is that ?
it is mifi .
if we &apos;re gonna be stuck here ,
then we might as well have internet .
you don &apos;t have to stay down here with me .
hey , look , i &apos;m not letting you out of my sight .
i ... i need you to talk to elena for me .
tell her how sorry i am for what damon and i had to do .
well , um ...
why don &apos;t you
tell her yourself ?
bonnie !
elena , i &apos;m so sorry .
it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok .
i just needed to see your face now .
there wasn &apos;t enough time for me to tell you .
it &apos;s ok , seriously . damon explained it all to me .
ugh . look .
klaus had to think she was dead .
your reaction had to be real .
i understand why you did what you did .
klaus was fooled ,
and bonnie &apos;s alive .
here &apos;s to duplicity .
but let &apos;s get one thing straight , damon .
bonnie will not die for me ,
i will not let that happen .
we need to kill klaus , elena .
real klaus .
who will probably be coming to pay you a visit soon
now that he knows that bonnie is dead .
she &apos;s the only one who can do it .
we &apos;ll find another way .
i hope so .
look , i shouldn &apos;t have hit you .
apology accepted .
let me be clear about something .
if it comes down to you and the witch again ,
i will gladly let bonnie die .
i will always choose you .
good night , damon .
