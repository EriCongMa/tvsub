do you want the spot ?
do i want the spot ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i thought ...
nothing .
what &apos;s the spot ?
oh , well , if you stand right here , you can see
the painter &apos;s signature .
the light catches it just right .
ah , then , sure , yeah , i do want the spot .
where am i looking ?
oh ... the inside top of the right thigh .
that wasn &apos;t a pickup line .
i did think you wanted the spot .
i know , i just like your voice .
i wanted to hear it again .
that &apos;s a made @-@ up accent , isn &apos;t it ?
yes , i use it to impress women in museums .
australians don &apos;t ask what people do ?
oh , we do . we just wait .
for ?
events to evolve .
oh , and how might they evolve ?
well , you will ask me in a few minutes
what i do for a living .
because i &apos;m an american ?
mm @-@ hmm , yes , and because it &apos;s a natural question ,
and that is why i have to ask you to dinner .
you have to ask me to dinner before i ask you what you do ?
yes , do you promise to meet me ?
i can &apos;t do that .
first tell me what you do , and then i &apos;ll decide .
i like you , diane .
and i &apos;m only doing this because this is my job .
you &apos;ve been served .
you &apos;re not becoming one of those over protective moms , are you ?
i might be .
mrs. hartly ?
wasn &apos;t she your teacher in middle school ?
yeah .
lillian and mrs. brooks .
where have they been ?
&quot; those poor , disadvantaged children . &quot;
&quot; can you imagine going to a public school ? &quot;
since when did i raise such sarcastic kids ?
who &apos;s that ?
i think that &apos;s kelsey &apos;s dad .
no , i think they moved away .
i think he wants you .
maybe he &apos;s a teacher ?
yes ?
mrs. florrick ?
yes .
so are you dating anyone ?
off and on .
you are the definition of &quot; off and on , &quot; will .
you gotta get serious sometime .
who says ?
the pope , i think .
well , your time &apos;s up ,
and someone &apos;s wait to cut in .
where are you , will ?
leaving a wedding .
i think wendy scott @-@ carr is coming after me
with a grand jury summons .
i , uh , will , we &apos;re on speakerphone .
uh , the summons isn &apos;t about you .
we got served , too-- alicia , myself , and david lee .
what ? why ?
it &apos;s one of david lee &apos;s divorces-- the huntley divorce .
the wife of the venture capitalist ?
we did well by her , didn &apos;t we ?
half his business assets , the house in highland park ,
and sole custody of their daughter .
she &apos;s not suing .
the husband is .
what , for being too effective ?
no .
alienation of affection .
you &apos;re kidding .
what is this , the &apos; 30s ?
no , we &apos;re one of seven states that still has it on the books .
yeah , as a joke ,
as a depression @-@ era curiosity .
what he &apos;s saying we split them up ?
that &apos;s crazy .
yes , and his lawyer is coming here in a few hours
to talk settlement .
you think the timing &apos;s suspicious ?
i do . three days bere we refinance ?
we &apos;re going through a short- term liquidity problem--
nothing to worry about .
okay , i &apos;m coming in .
we need to get this off the books fast .
where &apos;s david lee ? what &apos;s he saying about this ?
what the hell ?
now i &apos;m being penalized for doing my job well ?
i , uh , uh , s @-@ s @-@ see you in a few minutes , will .
you know what ?
we countersue .
it &apos;s the principle of the thing .
so , david , not to pry , but did you enlist ?
yes , i was getting bored .
the yale club .
i was served backstage during gilbert and sullivan .
alicia , you were on the huntley divorce your first year .
he was sleeping with some stripper .
good , that &apos;s what we need .
there can &apos;t be alienation of affection
if the husband was cheating .
get kalinda .
there &apos;s , uh , there &apos;s nothing i need to know here ,
is there , david ?
what do you mean ?
i think you know what i mean .
this was a straight division of assets .
we were there for her , we did right by her .
good .
doesn &apos;t let up , does it ?
not often .
is everything all right ?
yeah , i was at a wedding .
no , i mean the wendy scott @-@ carr thing .
yeah , don &apos;t worry , something i &apos;m handling , you know .
this is an easy lawsuit .
we just need to get to the wife . she ...
i thought i &apos;d dress up for this lawyer .
we just need to get to the wife , get her on record .
what &apos;s her name ?
april huntley .
right , she hired us , he didn &apos;t .
she &apos;s the one who wanted the divorce .
we didn &apos;t force anything on her .
she &apos;s still a client ?
julius is primary on her business holdings .
i &apos;ll call him ?
no , will , you talk to her .
why ?
because will can talk to her .
do we know her husband &apos;s attorney ?
no , someone from l.a.
l.a. ? why l.a. ?
it &apos;s freezing outside .
yes , i know , it &apos;s january .
all this affection for seasons .
i don &apos;t understand .
i think it &apos;s about change .
yeah , change-- it &apos;s monstrous .
hmm . may i help you ?
i &apos;m burl preston for diane lockhart .
he &apos;s really suing us .
we thought you could sign an affidavit
saying you asked us for the divorce .
jake is such a turd .
he &apos;really suing you ?
april , how does jake know burl preston ?
burl who ?
preston .
he &apos;s an l.a. lawyer , a top l.a. lawyer .
oh , it must be from one of his companies .
why ?
i &apos;m just surprised he would take this case .
maybe he wants part of the $ 44 million .
will , you there ?
yes , i &apos;m here .
how did you know your husband was suing for $ 44 million ?
how did i know ?
you said .
no , i didn &apos;t .
ms. lockhart ,
i always seem to visiting you during the cold months .
yes , i don &apos;t suppose you would fly us out to l.a. for the depositions ?
ah , now there &apos;s an idea .
i , uh , i don &apos;t think you &apos;ve met .
captain david lee-- i was the divorce attorney .
so you &apos;re the one who wrested control of my client &apos;s companies ?
uh , no , i think he should look to his wife for that .
we just got her ...
david , stop .
mr. gardner , hello .
good to see you again .
they have her .
they have mrs. huntley .
that &apos;s right , mr. and mrs. huntley have reconciled .
you broke up their marriage
and hastily sold off their most valuable asset .
it was a fair division of assets .
for you , yes .
bubble elastic was a company owned by mr. huntley .
mrs. huntley gained control of it during the divorce .
exactly , she gained control .
until you helped her sell it earlier this year at a loss .
it &apos;s now worth $ 44 million .
this is not a harassment suit .
you conspired to end this marriage for your financial gain .
as a result , my client lost out on a $ 44 million windfall ,
and that is the amount you will pay .
wait a minute !
this was always part of the equity partner agreement .
i have no control over family law .
why should i be held accountable for his screwups ?
my screwups ? i did not ...
okay , okay , hold it together , guys .
no , i &apos;m not going to take that from him .
him ? julius .
my name is julius .
all right , all right , listen up !
we need to win .
malpractice insurance won &apos;t cover this .
it &apos;s an intentional tort ,
so we are all on the hook for $ 1.2 million .
excuse me ?
we &apos;re on the hook for $ 1.2 million .
all of the equity partners share everything
in sickness and in health .
who is he ?
um , i just signed the equity partner agreement last week ,
and you &apos;re telling me i owe you $ 1.2 million ?
only if we lose , eli .
which , given david lee and his methods ,
seems highly likely .
oh , go to hell , julius .
there , i said your name . happy ?
i &apos;ll be happy when you &apos;re disbarred .
how about that ? you &apos;re a moron !
bring it on .
what is going on here ?
one happy family .
could you , uh , buzz diane lockhart ?
excuse me , this is a place of business .
yes , hi .
tori , get security .
if you want to serve someone ,
you can leave it with the receptionist .
no , i &apos;m not here to ...
i &apos;m here for diane on a personal matter .
yeah , it &apos;s all personal .
mike , can you escort this process server
down to the lobby , please ?
sir .
please give this to her , okay ?
you can leave it with the receptionist .
the photos are real .
he did meet and sleep with the stripper .
but ... ?
it wasn &apos;t purely spontaneous .
we did not .
no , we didn &apos;t .
mrs. huntley wanted full custody of her daughter .
that was unlikely ,
so david lee asked me to set up a dui trap .
the stripper wasn &apos;t supposed to sleep with him ,
just get him drinking above the legal limit ,
and then a cop i called pulled him over .
i mean , it worked .
the husband had a dui just before the custody hearing .
he lost custody .
you have such lofty goals when you start a law firm--
dreams of fighting injustice , righting wrongs .
again , the point wasn &apos;t to get him to sleep with her .
mr. huntley acted on his own there .
was this discussed with the client ?
mrs. huntley ?
not to my knowledge .
she just wanted full custody of her daughter .
this was david lee going the extra mile .
yep , good old david lee .
was this written down anywhere-- this dui trap ?
possibly in david &apos;s notes , but i &apos;m not sure .
okay , we &apos;ll try to limit discovery .
kalinda , you do a document sweep .
we need to know what skeletons are rattling around .
and , alicia , you &apos;re the david lee wrangler .
will , do you have a minute ?
thank you , alicia , kalinda .
we can &apos;t catch a breath , can we ?
you need to hire a lawyer .
we can handle this .
no .
i mean wendy scott @-@ carr .
i have a few names .
no , it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m interviewing jason cline and lionel deerfield .
they &apos;re good .
we don &apos;t want this to go to a grand jury .
i know .
you &apos;re okay ?
i am .
if this starts impacting the firm ,
we &apos;ll have to talk .
will , there is nothing we &apos;ll ever have to talk about .
this is a state &apos;s attorney witch hunt .
that &apos;s all .
we &apos;re in this together .
it &apos;s probably too early to drink .
another two hours .
you need a lawyer .
i need a lawyer .
thanks for coming in , jason .
i seem to be the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s target of the month .
yeah .
i think this investigation
into judicial bribery is getting more serious .
don &apos;t worry . you &apos;ll be fine .
i will ?
oh , yeah .
this is a little hiccup .
the state &apos;s attorney just needs to ...
throw its weight around a little bit .
what about a grand jury ?
oh . grand juries .
they &apos;re a joke .
i &apos;m a fighter .
we &apos;ll fight them together .
he told me my husband was cheating on me .
he showed me pictures .
i was stunned .
i trusted my lawyer . i trusted my firm .
but your husband did cheat on you ?
no . he said he had never met that woman before .
she sat down next to him and offered to buy a drink .
but this is him kissing her , isn &apos;t it ?
it was a peck-- a peck on the cheek .
and didn &apos;t he say this was a setup by your divorce lawyer ?
would you like to take over the questioning , mr. preston ?
no , but i thought we might cut to the chase .
okay . here &apos;s the chase .
you came to david lee to divorce your husband ?
no . i came to david lee for advice .
is this your signature
on the attorney @-@ client retainer agreement ?
and what does it say on the top there ?
&quot; intent to divorce . &quot;
april , did you try
to reconcile with your husband before the divorce ?
yes , twice .
and when you told your divorce attorney this ?
he showed me these pictures .
of course , i showed her the pictures .
she was wanting to reconcile with the bum .
and you didn &apos;t want that ?
if i &apos;m a shoe salesman and you come to buy shoes ,
it &apos;s not my job to talk you out of it .
it &apos;s my job to find a good shoe for you .
twice , she tried to reconcile .
twice , she came to you to call off the divorce .
twice , you convinced her not to .
because he was shtupping a stripper .
that was not proven . mr. huntley denies ...
oh , my god . he does ?
how could i have been so mistaken ?
mr. lee was speaking sarcastically .
who do you call a true friend ?
the one who sees your husband shtupping a stripper
and says nothing , or the one who says something ?
did you hire the stripper ?
did i what ? did i hire this woman ? are you crazy ?
please , answer the question .
no , i did not hire the stripper .
you perjure yourself in here , sir ,
it &apos;s the equivalent of perjuring yourself court .
thank you .
go ahead and ask the question again .
did you hire this woman ?
no , i did not hire the stripper pictured in those photos .
i did lose my virginity when i was 14 .
i do have a secret crush on jacqueline onassis .
okay , thank you .
i didn &apos;t cry when the challenger exploded .
thank you .
basically , you &apos;re in trouble .
thanks .
i &apos;m not here to sugarcoat it , will .
you hire me , i &apos;ll give it to you straight .
they &apos;re investigating you for arranging bribery ,
and from the sound of it , they have something .
they have circumstantial something .
for a grand jury , that &apos;s enough .
and your defense ?
turn evidence .
against who ? i don &apos;t have anything .
everybody has something .
give it to them .
for a lighter sentence .
how light ?
two years , maybe .
probation ?
no . minimum security .
loss of your law license .
i could never practice law again ?
that &apos;s right .
god , you &apos;re a bundle of laughs .
yep .
old age .
my cynicism seeping through like oil through a garden of leaves .
are you guys being sued ?
i saw burl preston out there .
good @-@ bye , lionel .
thank you .
is it true ?
what ? the challenger ?
yes , i didn &apos;t cry .
david .
did you hire that stripper for a dui trap ?
$ 44 million .
that &apos;s what i just saved you in there .
they can &apos;t prove we hired that stripper ,
the lawsuit goes away .
and you want to question that ?
i want to question you perjuring yourself .
i told him the truth-- i did not hire her .
kalinda did ?
this is an adult &apos;s game , diane .
i &apos;m fine if you don &apos;t want to play ,
but then don &apos;t ask the questions .
and what about alicia ?
what about her ?
she &apos;s being deposed next .
will she contradict you ?
when you had your troubles with the treasury , the treasury monitor ...
yes ?
the lawyer you used-- she was good ?
yeah , she was great .
what was her name ?
elsbeth tascioni .
are you looking for a lawyer ?
i might be .
too bad there are none here .
what &apos;s going on , will ?
you don &apos;t have to tell me .
it &apos;s not anything .
i just don &apos;t want to make life more complicated .
she &apos;s discreet , this woman ?
yes .
um , she &apos;s also different .
i &apos;m not sure how well you &apos;ll get along .
well , is it worth a meeting ?
it is .
don &apos;t judge by first impressions .
promise .
hi . alicia , how are you ?
good . david , what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;ve done something for you .
your children &apos;s trust-- i decided to get a jump on it .
okay , thanks .
no problem .
had to get done .
it was complicated because it had to anticipate
all the ways you might go with your husband .
separation , divorce .
so ... you know , my memory--
not so good .
anyway , with your upcoming deposition ,
i just wanted to check my facts with you ,
make sure we &apos;re in agreement .
you know ?
will they ever dump david lee ?
no . he brings in too much money .
what if he was costing too much money ?
well , depends on how much money .
it &apos;s not about love ; it &apos;s about commerce .
so if i made a play ?
it would depend on the play .
okay . thanks a lot .
but if you go after david lee ,
you &apos;d better win , or it won &apos;t be pretty .
it &apos;s kind of nerve @-@ racking in here , isn &apos;t it ?
everybody ducking and covering ?
no , it seems fine to me .
really ?
then you &apos;re made of stronger stuff .
you , uh ...
you know the penalty for perjury , mrs. florrick ?
i do .
what is it ?
perjury is a class three felony resulting in imprisonment
for no less than two years and no more than five .
good .
thank you .
in what capacity
did you assist david lee on the huntley divorce ?
under his supervision , i helped negotiate
the division of assets and execute the paperwork .
and what else ?
i &apos;m not sure what you mean .
didn &apos;t you also function as something of a hand @-@ holder
for my client ?
no .
you didn &apos;t ?
i didn &apos;t .
oh . i see .
let me try again .
did you function as hand @-@ holder to april huntley ,
the wife of my client ?
i tried to comfort her . yes .
you told her you had also dealt with an unfaithful spouse ?
we commiserated over similarities in our personal lives .
did you express what a relief it was
to be away from a cheating husband ,
saying , &quot; you can &apos;t imagine the relief
you feel that first night ,
just being alone , having a glass of wine &quot; ?
objection , mr. preston .
are we really delving into mrs. florrick &apos;s private life ?
only as far as mrs. florrick delved
into it to further the firm &apos;s interests .
did you exploit your marital status
to influence my client &apos;s wife ?
mrs. huntley asked me about my own experiences ,
and i shared those with her in an attempt to comfort .
that is all .
to your knowledge ,
did david lee hire the stripper , alexandria ,
to seduce my client ?
no .
you &apos;re under oath , mrs. florrick .
yes , i recognize that , and my answer is still no .
that seems to be your case , mr. preston .
shall we call it a day ?
uh , just ... just one more thing .
mrs. florrick ,
what is this ?
it appears to be a contract for the sale of bubble elastic .
it is , in fact .
your law firm negotiated that sale ?
we did .
do you see that last line ?
what percentage did your law firm negotiate
for bubble elastic &apos;s future profits ?
it says five ,
but i was not involved in that .
i know .
but i thought a third @-@ year associate who perjured herself ...
objection .
... would be the best one to read
about the demise of lockhart / gardner .
is this a deposition or an attack ?
a little of both , actually .
that line there-- five percent-- means you made more
from that company than mrs. huntley .
does that sound fair , mrs. florrick ?
it sounds like a judgment call .
a legal judgment call .
ms. lockhart is right .
i may not have you on alienation of affection ,
but i now have you on fraud .
we &apos;re done here . thank you .
oh , no .
we &apos;re just beginning .
it was money .
i was trying to make the firm money .
i &apos;m not going to pay for his mistake .
well , i &apos;m not paying for yours .
okay , let &apos;s all raise hands , one at a time .
i got a five percent return on the company sale--
i can &apos;t help it if david lee got his client less .
what ? are you kidding ?
and now he &apos;s abdicating responsibility .
your left hand does not know what your right hand is doing .
why am i being persecuted for doing my job ?
because you didn &apos;t tell us , and now it &apos;s fraud ,
you stupid ...
stupid what ?
ooh . come on , say it .
i didn &apos;t say anything .
i wasn &apos;t going to say anything , and i &apos;m
really offended that you think i would say ...
oh , are you offended , david ?
thank you very much .
are you offended , david ?
thank you .
did the client sign a conflict of interest waiver ?
that &apos;s right , she did . it &apos;s standard for us .
good , we &apos;re protected . it can &apos;t be fraud if she signed off
on any potential conflict of interest .
why don &apos;t i find it in discovery ?
because you &apos;re blind .
it &apos;s there . it &apos;s a standard rider .
all right , where , david ?
it &apos;s a rider .
if it &apos;s not with the hard copy , it &apos;s in the database .
i &apos;ll get kalinda on it .
diane .
we need to talk .
clause 63 .
in a malpractice case , the partners can vote
to hold only the negligent partner liable
for the entirety of damages .
we &apos;re not throwing anyone under the bus , eli .
last time i looked , we &apos;re all under the bus .
this was a clause insisted on by david lee .
he was the one ...
who told you that ?
who told me david lee insisted on it ? kalinda .
he was afraid to be at the mercy
of other people &apos;s mistakes . it seems only fitting ...
david lee brought in 30 % of the firm &apos;s business this year .
and 100 % of the malpractice suits .
you are a profit participant now , eli .
throwing david lee overboard is shortsighted .
it is reacting to short @-@ term circumstances
with long @-@ term measures , and i won &apos;t do it .
no , you won &apos;t do it .
because you have a failed romantic notion
that what you &apos;re running here is a family .
it &apos;s not a family , diane .
a family can &apos;t fire you .
a family doesn &apos;t cost me $ 1.2 million .
we &apos;re not doing it , eli .
if david lee came to me wanting to dump you ,
i would have that same answer .
i can outvote you .
all i need is a majority of the equity partners .
well , that &apos;s true .
too bad you haven &apos;t been fostering relationships .
no time like the present .
芝加哥美术馆
oh , sorry .
they &apos;re painting .
they keep trying to improve my office--
oh , no , wait , wait , wait !
oh , no .
that &apos;s okay .
the painters are practical jokers .
thanks for meeting me , ms. tascioni .
i &apos;ve met a lot of lawyers ,
but mrs. florrick swears by you .
she &apos;s very nice .
so , they &apos;re accusing you of bribing judges ?
the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office , yes .
but they &apos;re not saying which ones ?
no .
do you hear that ?
yes .
fantasia , someone &apos;s calling !
fantasia !
why don &apos;t i come back another time ?
no , no . this &apos;ll just take ...
uh , call back !
if you can hear me , call back !
you know , let me arrange another time
for us to meet .
no , no . mr. gardner ,
who are the three most honest judges in cook county ?
the three most honest ?
i don &apos;t know .
howard , spinelli , kotter .
why ?
and you &apos;re just waiting around for a grand jury , right ?
yes .
that &apos;s a mistake .
you have to apply pressure to the special prosecutor .
how do i do that ?
no , you don &apos;t do anything . i do that .
and how do you do that ?
i have no idea .
but ...
i &apos;m just starting .
okay ?
okay .
okay .
i think that &apos;s a different one .
fantasia !
if it &apos;s logged in , it &apos;s logged in .
yeah , but i checked the database . the contract &apos;s on there ,
but there &apos;s one page missing : the rider .
it &apos;s one page . so what ?
$ 44 million depends on that one page .
well , here &apos;s a suggestion .
maybe it doesn &apos;t exist .
whoever logged it in messed up , never got the rider signed .
well , can you find out who logged it in ?
if they log it in , it &apos;s in my database .
computers don &apos;t make things up , people make things up .
there . that &apos;s who logged it in .
that &apos;s who made the mistake , not me .
is something wrong ?
uh , the huntleys-- that was your first divorce ?
second .
and you were at the firm for how long ?
a half a year . why ?
you supervised the signing of the contract ?
yes .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i &apos;m finding some difficulties in the filing .
there was no rider .
in the hard copy , i know .
you have to check the database .
i did .
i can &apos;t find it there , either .
there was a rider .
you sure ?
i saw her sign it .
i was there when she signed it .
i had to sign it , too .
oh , my god .
are you sure ?
this whole lawsuit depends on that rider .
look , it was your first year here .
is there any chance you could &apos;ve ...
no .
no , i mean , is there any chance
you could &apos;ve filed it somewhere else ?
i don &apos;t think so , no .
i have to tell diane .
wait a minute .
i &apos;m in the lobby , alicia . i can &apos;t hear .
i &apos;m on my way up .
well , look who &apos;s here .
yep .
hi .
mr. copeland ,
thank you for the poster , but the answer is no .
i &apos;m not interested in having ...
would you excuse me ? just for a second .
mr. dobbs ?
hello .
apologies .
that &apos;s not me .
the summons is delivered , sir , when ...
the summons is accepted when you acknowledge your name .
do you understand ?
please , stop struggling .
i &apos;ll let you go , mr. dobbs ,
if you promise not to fight .
now , do you promise not to fight ?
yes .
just take a few breaths .
you &apos;ll be fine .
i &apos;ll sue your ass !
that &apos;s your first impulse ,
but i &apos;ve documented everything , and we got witnesses .
you have been served , mr. dobbs .
you were saying ?
that happens all the time ?
no , no .
sometimes .
most people are pretty good about it .
i wasn &apos;t here to see you .
it was the same building ; i serve this district .
oh , i see .
well , i ... i misunderstood .
it was very nice to see you again .
very nice to see you .
what happened ?
we can &apos;t find the rider .
i filed it , but we can &apos;t find it .
the rider was signed .
i was supervising alicia ;
i know it was signed .
then where is it ?
would you stop cheering for disaster ?
i &apos;m not cheering for anything .
this is an i.t. problem .
no , it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all our problem .
i &apos;m sorry .
i know i logged it .
it was your first year , alicia .
are you sure ?
yes .
thank you , alicia .
so , clause 63 ?
yeah . clause 63 .
people have come after me-- random people , here and there--
but you &apos;re the first to do it so baldly .
nice office .
thank you .
a lot of square footage .
i don &apos;t keep track .
how much are you bringing in each year ?
i haven &apos;t been here long enough to judge .
yet you feel comfortable enough to try to get me dumped .
yeah , i guess i do .
is this a get @-@ to @-@ know- each @-@ other session
or are we confronting each other ?
you are gone .
you are so gone you might as well clean out your desk .
really ?
uh , why is that ?
because i will insist on it .
oh , no . mmm . i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t clause 63 me . i clause 63 you .
yeah , that might &apos;ve worked at another time ,
but you screwed up , buddy .
and people who screw up can &apos;t act like they didn &apos;t .
they have to act contrite .
and just so you know , contrite is not this .
okay . this was fun .
just so you know ,
i was going to leave .
i had plans to leave .
but now you made it worth my while .
nice to meet you . buddy .
do you have a moment ?
sure .
diane has asked me to get your best memory of what happened .
sure . let &apos;s go for it .
okay .
do you remember what time of day the contract was signed ?
after refreshing my memory with my day planner .
it was signed at 11 : 00 a.m.
i &apos;m sorry , um , i have to ask you this ,
but where did you go afterward ?
according to my day planner , i had a function at school .
grace &apos;s school , an assembly .
and before you left , you filed the contract ?
yes .
mrs. huntley and her lawyer
retained two executed copies and we retained one .
which you filed ?
yes . in the active drawer .
and you made the photocopy or did a paralegal ?
i did . and i personally filed it in the archive .
and the rider was separate ?
i don &apos;t remember .
do you remember having to attach the rider to the contract ?
no .
you don &apos;t remember ?
i don &apos;t remember .
do you remember signing the rider , also ?
you had to sign it to act as a witness to her signature .
i &apos;m gonna write that down as a &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t remember .
i &apos;m gonna write that down as a &quot; yes . &quot;
no .
i don &apos;t remember .
alicia florrick .
yes ?
we found the rider .
where ? oh .
cary &apos;s files .
they had been moved into storage when we did the expansion .
we found a hard copy .
we have it .
we &apos;re good , we &apos;re good .
we &apos;re okay .
you must &apos;ve been killing yourself .
yes . thanks .
so i &apos;ll get on the phone with mr. preston .
why should we delay the good news from him ?
oh , there it is .
the rider , april huntley &apos;s signature ,
and there &apos;s your confirming signature .
well , david , we dodged the bullet .
yes , we did .
oh , i can &apos;t wait to see his face .
but ... you &apos;re not sure ?
am i sure that this rider is something david lee slipped to me to sign ?
no .
i just ...
i think there were six pages in my children &apos;s
trust that i signed , and now there are five .
but you &apos;re not certain ?
100 % certain ?
no .
then i think you have to commit to your best memory of events .
i don &apos;t understand .
you remember seeing this rider being signed two years ago ?
yes .
you &apos;re sure of that ?
yes .
and you &apos;re not sure whether this rider page is different ?
that &apos;s correct .
testimony is about your best memory .
you go with your best memory .
what if it &apos;s wrong ?
testimony isn &apos;t about right or wrong , alicia .
it &apos;s about the facts as established by your best memory of events .
your memory is this .
you saw the rider being signed .
then that &apos;s the fact .
it &apos;s not up to me to do my opponent &apos;s job for him .
it &apos;s up to mr. preston to poke holes in your testimony .
you do not poke holes in your own .
do you understand ?
i do .
thank you .
okay , now , point this down and don &apos;t run .
okay ? he &apos;s right over there .
i heard this play was really good .
i like anything with bears .
yes .
you &apos;re wendy scott @-@ carr ?
i am .
do you work at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
no .
no . i &apos;m a lawyer representing will gardner .
elsbeth tascioni .
i see .
he hired a lawyer ?
what ? yes .
although , um , we haven &apos;t worked out all the details yet .
but i know that you met with my client ,
and i don &apos;t think you should
do that again without me being there , okay ?
if that &apos;s what you &apos;d like .
it is . if you don &apos;t mind ?
wow . let me see .
oh , he even put your names in it .
why don &apos;t you go see
if you can get one from the lion , too , okay ?
oh ! go ahead .
say &quot; hi &quot; for me .
your client bribed several judges , ms. tascioni .
yes , well , funny you should bring that up .
a reporter called me today from the chicago tribune .
very nice man .
and , um , he asked me about these three judges
that mr. gardner supposedly bribed ...
i didn &apos;t say anything to the press .
no , i know . i didn &apos;t think you did .
anyway , he asked me
if they were in fact howard , spinelli and kotter .
and i said i didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not investigating them .
i know , i thought probably not .
because , as i said to this reporter ,
those are three of the most honest
and beloved judges on the bench , and , you know ,
that would put you in a very difficult position
at the courthouse , with all those judges very angry ...
at you .
you leaked those names ?
i can bring obstruction of justice charges
against you right now .
yes , unfortunately , you &apos;ll need a judge
to sanction any such charge , and i think you &apos;ll find
those judges in an uncooperative mood right now .
here we are .
your client better get ready for an indictment .
um , no , he doesn &apos;t need to be ready ,
because you know , i am .
then i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll meet again .
oh , i can &apos;t wait .
this is absurd .
pardon ?
do you expect me to believe
this critical document surfaced at precisely the right time ?
what are you suggesting ?
that it &apos;s a forgery ?
i am .
then i &apos;m offended .
then we &apos;d like to re @-@ depose the parties involved
to vouch for the document &apos;s legitimacy .
and another first @-@ year associate
who worked on the divorce we &apos;ve yet to depose--
cary agos .
certainly .
why don &apos;t we arrange a time tomorrow ?
working late ?
no .
you &apos;re not ?
nope .
well , then , what are you doing here ?
there &apos;s something i thought might help you with your , um ... summons .
my summons ?
yes , your lawsuit .
mr. huntley had to sign off
on the summons before i delivered them .
yes ?
and he wasn &apos;t at his wife &apos;s apartment .
really ?
do you recognize this document ?
no .
you &apos;ve never seen it before ?
no .
thank you .
you worked on this divorce case alongside alicia florrick
and under the supervision of david lee ?
yes .
so , you were in a perfect position to see such a document ?
not necessarily .
but you worked closely on this case ?
yes , but that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
it &apos;s been two years .
i couldn &apos;t tell you a single document that &apos;s in that file , to be honest .
do you have any idea how a document
signed by alicia florrick got into your files in the first place ?
sure . we shared an assistant .
things got mixed up sometimes .
you were fired from this firm , is that right ?
yes .
so your testimony may be influenced
by the fact that you want your job back ?
i can see that you got a yarn you want to spin ,
mr. preston , so let me just go ahead and lay this out clearly for you .
i have absolutely no reason
to believe that document is a forgery .
i knew mrs. florrick and mr. lee to be outstanding ,
competent and ethical attorneys throughout my time at the firm .
and as for me ,
i have no vested interest in the outcome of this case .
i don &apos;t work here , and i don &apos;t intend to .
any additional questions ?
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
i ... i don &apos;t get it .
what &apos;s so funny ?
things change .
they do .
i like working with your husband .
he likes working with you .
given that you &apos;ve been unable to establish
the waiver is anything but perfectly legitimate
you are not left with much of a case .
we disagree . we intend to obtain a forensic analysis
of the ink on the document
to determine whether it &apos;s actually two years or two days old .
that &apos;s ambitious . and will run you about $ 30,000 .
so we would offer that same $ 30,000
as a , um , goodwill gesture .
absolutely not .
well , then ... this is our final offer .
okay , those are fake .
you &apos;ll probably have to do better than that .
they were probably taken when we were split up .
i bought you that shirt last week .
okay , hon , just stay calm .
you disgusting , shameless piece of ...
let &apos;s just take a breath ... april .
april , please . please .
please , honey .
it &apos;s not true , your honor .
yes , there is an investigation ,
but the article as reported is not true .
his honor kotter .
your honor , i have a judge on the other line .
no , no , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll call you back .
judge howard is in the waiting room .
we have to take the fight back to her .
back to ... ?
we have to indict will gardner .
he is a liability , diane .
and , frankly , you &apos;re better off without him .
thursday would be just fine for me .
all i really need is two weeks .
stop it , both of you !
stop what ? i &apos;m not bluffing .
you work at opposite ends of the building .
you barely see each other .
it &apos;s not about seeing each other .
it &apos;s about his methods costing me $ 1.2 million .
if you &apos;d like me to go somewhere else ,
diane , just say the word .
no , david .
you will stay here because we leave you alone .
somewhere else will leave me just as alone .
no , they won &apos;t .
not the way we will , and you know it .
it &apos;s a new economy .
people have to divorce .
this lawsuit cost you . and that is a simple fact .
everybody knows you &apos;re a risk ,
so stop threatening .
and , eli , you &apos;re staying
because this job is a temporary one for you
until the governor &apos;s campaign .
tell me i &apos;m wrong .
good . this is an office of expediency .
that is its strength .
so stop bickering ...
and stop pretending like you &apos;ll leave .
i won &apos;t have it .
i &apos;m going back to work .
good .
eli ?
you &apos;re back ?
how are you ?
i &apos;m fine . how are you ?
fine .
well , then , we &apos;re both fine .
i have to apologize again .
i requested this job
so i &apos;d see you again .
why is that ?
mr. gardner ?
