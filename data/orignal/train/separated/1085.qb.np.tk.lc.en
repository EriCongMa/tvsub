pink panthers , the most dangerous gang of thieves in the world .
let neal infiltrate the gang .
keller is working as a c.i. for interpol .
pink panthers for my freedom .
it has to be ironclad .
you deserve to .
they promised you freedom before .
what makes you think this time they &apos;ll deliver ?
who says that &apos;s all i &apos;m after ?
the panthers are going after the fed .
how much cash are we talking ?
$ 500 million .
all that cash , through tubes ?
these tubes are linked to the airport .
they carry the cash , so we won &apos;t have to .
we walk right out and straight to
where the money is waiting for us , here .
this is all going down now ! you said you had a bigger plan .
where the hell do i fit in ?
let me make this clear .
i am not going to raise our child
as a married single mother .
and he &apos;s gonna be the first priority in this family .
we have a problem to solve .
because now , we &apos;re a man short .
i assume you have a solution .
i do .
now who the hell are you ?
woodford , we need another man . he &apos;s the best i know .
we can do the job without him .
no , we can &apos;t , okay ?
trust me . trust him .
why should i ?
because i pulled the graff diamond heist in london in &apos; 07 .
sloane street .
modeled it after the same graff diamond heist you pulled in &apos; 03 .
either shoot him , or let &apos;s get on with our day .
the &apos; 07 job was some of the best work i &apos;ve ever seen .
brilliantly planned .
you &apos;re making me blush .
remind me .
what was it you drove for the getaway ?
a bentley continental flying spur .
but that &apos;s a trick question . i wasn &apos;t driving .
we had a chauffeur .
nice work , mr. dunbar .
learned from the best .
the suit ?
i can &apos;t believe you gave my spot in the panthers to the suit !
calm down , moz .
i am calm .
no , you &apos;re not . that &apos;s a zinfandel .
i am drinking the &apos; 93 cab franc .
don &apos;t try to stop me .
hey , caffrey ...
you sure we want cue ball on this ?
neal , please explain to me what &apos;s going on ,
before i have an aneurysm .
sit down , i &apos;ll explain .
said brutus to caesar . no , i &apos;ll stand .
how do i know this little weasel &apos;s not gonna steal my cash and run ?
what cash ?
steal $ 30 million from the pink panthers
with no one the wiser .
if you shut that hole in your face for two seconds ,
you might learn something . come on .
kept ya on the outside for a reason , moz .
that &apos;s exactly where i need you .
i &apos;m the outside man .
there you go .
the panthers will never see it coming .
the f.b.i won &apos;t be looking for you .
and even if they were ,
you &apos;ll be somewhere else entirely .
tapping into the pneumatic tubes from a separate location .
siphoning 30 million in cash .
okay , i &apos;ll need to find the best collection point .
somewhere en route from j.f.k
to the old post office .
it &apos;s adorable .
wait , wait .
didn &apos;t you say if you screw over the panthers ,
they go after everyone you care about ?
the panthers won &apos;t know it was us .
see you bright and breezy , caffrey .
you &apos;re worried .
and what are you gonna do when keller double @-@ crosses us ?
i &apos;ll be ready .
oh , it &apos;s a party !
oh , you got it !
as requested .
my goodness .
june , you look lovely .
as always .
thank you !
look at you !
you know this was byron &apos;s favorite outfit .
was it ?
yes , indeed .
it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s elegant .
i will drink to that .
to elegant simplicity .
yes . indeed .
do you remember our meeting in that silly little thrift shop ?
that was the beginning of everything new for me .
and i thank you for that .
and you have been my saving grace .
you really have . thank you .
for everything .
i &apos;ll drink to that , to special things ...
okay .
and saving graces .
is there anything you don &apos;t drink to ?
no .
to what i may have missed .
there we go .
so same time next week ?
yeah .
i &apos;ll bring the vermouth .
you bet your bippy you &apos;ll bring the vermouth .
consider that bippy broughten .
i hope you have a good time with your nephew tonight .
oh , thank you . he &apos;s an exceptional young man .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow morning .
yes , you will .
i love you .
i love you back .
bye .
bye .
speaking of first meetings ,
i came across something the other day .
the lady !
from our first meeting playing three @-@ card monte
in madison square park .
still has the ridge .
you took me for five large .
that &apos;s when i knew you were the best .
and i followed you home .
and i haven &apos;t had a decent wine collection since .
we used to do all this for the thrill .
the stakes never mattered .
and now we &apos;re hitting j.f.k for $ 500 million .
we have flown too high .
one more flight .
said icarus .
look , after this , we go back to the basics .
i like that .
keep an eye on the lady for me .
what ?
back to basics .
so what &apos;s this announcement peter tells me about ?
we know the sex of the baby .
well ?
blue cake . you &apos;re having a boy .
yup .
yes ! congratulations !
thank you .
thank you .
a boy !
yeah .
oh , my gosh . you &apos;re in so much trouble .
oh , i know , i know .
i &apos;m in trouble .
she &apos;s in trouble .
all right , i have to admit something .
how did you know ?
i read peter &apos;s body language
when you told me you guys had an announcement .
his voice got deeper , his shoulders straightened ,
he took a masculine stance .
well , i gotta tell ya , that is very impressive--
i have no idea how that got in there .
i know all your tricks .
oh , not all of them .
coffee ?
yeah , sounds good .
okay .
can i talk to you for a second ?
of course , yeah .
you know things are different now .
i &apos;m pregnant and ...
it &apos;s not gonna work without peter .
i know this gang is dangerous , and i &apos;m scared .
but i trust peter and i trust you ...
to a point .
and i &apos;m asking you-- actually , no , i &apos;m telling you
that i need you to make sure he &apos;s safe .
i swear to you
that i will stop at nothing to keep him safe .
peter , you , your son ...
you &apos;re my family .
here we go .
here you are , sir .
decaf ?
right .
thank you .
peter , i am impressed .
i thought you only drank f.b.i drip .
well , a friend of mine introduced me to
italian roast a few years ago .
sounds like a smart guy .
jury &apos;s out on that one .
to-- uh-- cappuccinos in the clouds .
braxnet &apos;s finest .
a self @-@ contained security lockbox .
or as i like to call her , &quot; big bertha . &quot;
we set off the alarms ,
then we activate this jamming device .
while the back @-@ up system reroutes the alarm transmission .
we can buy more time .
precisely .
the jammer will afford us a total of 11 minutes .
and we &apos;ll move the money in these .
and each holds up to 4 million in franklins
or 800,000 in jacksons .
that &apos;s moving roughly a million a second .
that &apos;s the plan .
we have to work in radio silence .
i will keep a one @-@ way radio to use in dire situations .
and you will find a way to get our tools into j.f.k tomorrow .
looks like we &apos;re in business , boys .
are you one of them mole people ?
i &apos;m their leader .
told ya .
and you said elton john .
collecting repatriated bodies . it &apos;s clever .
i &apos;m starting to see a little bit of caffrey in ya , burke .
excuse me , miss .
you drop something ?
oh , my gosh . i &apos;m so embarrassed .
oh , don &apos;t be . it &apos;s our little secret .
thank you . this wasn &apos;t cheap .
amazing what they charge for so little material .
break a zipper there ?
it seems okay .
yeah ?
you didn &apos;t drop anything else scandalous , did you ?
no , i &apos;m good .
all right .
enjoy your destination . have a good time .
hold it right there .
how ya doing ? we &apos;re with midwood mortuary .
here to pick up two bodies from thailand .
i wasn &apos;t expecting bodies today .
you know what they say : death doesn &apos;t have a schedule .
open up the back please .

hey ! let &apos; em in .
who the hell are you ?
i &apos;m from gate 30 over in commercial flights .
so you know these guys ?

32 psi .
we &apos;re good to go .
let &apos;s do it .
all right . give me that hundred .
all right .
all right , remember , we have three minutes
to break into the safe .
after that , we lose one million
for every second we &apos;re not moving money .
you ready ?
we &apos;re all set .
peter &apos;s watch is on . they &apos;re starting .
all units get ready .
don &apos;t touch the needle valve . it locks the tumblers .

7 .
bertha has a very big heart .
all right , we got six minutes . come on .
whoo ! let &apos;s go , guys , line it up !
watch out .
heads up .
here we go .
next one .
let &apos;s go .
&quot; adad ,
do you believe as your king believes ,
i am one of their gods ? &quot;
&quot; no , my lord .
&quot; our gods are always angry and giving orders .
you smile . &quot;
yes !
there &apos;s something wrong .
it &apos;s stuck .
well , increase the suction !
it &apos;s at full capacity .
there &apos;s something &apos;s wrong on the other end .
are you a moron ?
we lost the jammer .
speed it up . come on .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
i think it &apos;s working !
go !
done ! let &apos;s go .
all right , let &apos;s go get them . call it .
all units , move in . move in !
what did the jam cost us ?
about $ 30 million .
good job , guys .
f.b.i ! don &apos;t move ! hands in the air !
woodford , do not pick up that gun .
listen to her , woodford .
i thought i told you not to make it too tight .
ah , i got caught up in the moment .
you should think twice before you join a gang next time .
you sound like my wife . did you call el ?
i told her it &apos;s all over .
thanks .
here , get mine off .
no , i think i &apos;ll wait .
neal , get mine off .
if i let you go , you promise to let me go ?
better than a promise , you got a contract .
hey , here we go again .
take it easy , sweetheart . i &apos;m sensitive .
coast clear , boss . we need you outside .
all right . you two stay put .
we did it . you and me , caffrey , we did it .
now we sit tight and let them process us ,
collect our money , then i never have to see you again .
yeah , that &apos;s fine by me .
my plans are changing , anyway .
i &apos;m gonna have to look elsewhere for my freedom .
you should too .
&apos;cause eventually , burke will figure out that i killed luc ,
so he &apos;s never going to let me go .
how many times has he offered you freedom ?
be honest .
this time &apos;s different .
see , that &apos;s your problem .
you look at him like he &apos;s a friend .
he looks at you like a prized possession .
case closer .
that &apos;s why you got no one .
that may be , but you mark my words .
burke and the feds , they &apos;ll find a way
to keep you on your leash a little longer .
where &apos;d he go ?
i don &apos;t--
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;d do this .
guess whose anklet just started transmitting .
where ?
wall street .
go , we &apos;ll wrap it up .
why are you here so soon ?
making sure you don &apos;t rob me .
ignoring that .
are those new suits ?
we &apos;re underneath wall street , moz .
we have to blend in .
so you &apos;ve already been booked and processed by the f.b.i ?
keller wouldn &apos;t do it . i didn &apos;t have a choice .
i won &apos;t trust burke with my freedom .
i &apos;d say these bags will buy you a lot more than your freedom .
that &apos;s $ 10 million . take it and go .
freedom isn &apos;t freedom if you have to duck every cop
on the street , neal .
if you can &apos;t buy a beer without thinking the bartender made you .
and always on the move . always on a hustle .
i thought you preferred that lifestyle .
i do . but it ain &apos;t cheap .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m gonna take all the money .
i @-@ i told you we couldn &apos;t trust him .
we had a deal , keller .
yeah , you &apos;re right . we did .
my knife begs to differ .
so does my gun .
you got over your fear pretty quickly .
it &apos;s a means to an end . drop the knife .
kick it to him .
moz , take what you can and go , all right ? i &apos;ll follow .
you want me to move these bags on my own without being noticed ?
you &apos;ll figure it out . go !
don &apos;t go too far , moz .
just you and me , huh ?
so what are you gonna do ?
something that should have been done years ago .
got a lot of history , you and me , neal .
i guess time flies when you &apos;re having fun , huh ?
you think it was fun for me with you back out ,
waiting to see what kind of pain you &apos;d bring to me ,
or the people i care about ?
you shouldn &apos;t worry about me anymore .
panthers have got it covered .
and they &apos;ll find out that you set &apos; em up ,
&apos;cause in the deepest , darkest prisons , neal ,
word travels fast .
well , at least that word won &apos;t come from your mouth .
you don &apos;t got it in you .
been a long road for us , huh ?
this is where it ends .
you really still think we &apos;re that different ?
i do . i know we are .
look around you , buddy .
i mean , here we are :
filthy basement , lying to everyone we know ,
sitting on millions of dollars in stolen cash .
face it , pal , you and me ,
we &apos;re the same , always have been .
two bad guys who destroy all the good around us .
that &apos;s not me .
maybe we should ask kate .
we all know what happened to her .
poor kid .
she was dead the moment she laid eyes on you .
it looks like you were right .
maybe this is the end for us .
hate to say it , neal ,
but it &apos;s time to go gently into that good night , old friend .
what &apos;s funny ?
you son of a bitch .
that &apos;s the one good thing about you , keller .
you &apos;re so damn predictable .
keller !
get out of my way ! get out of the way !
hurry !
keller !
come here . come here . relax . relax .
no , no , no !
relax . relax .
don &apos;t come any closer , burke . don &apos;t do it .
you let her go , keller !
i &apos;m tired of taking orders from you .
so right now we &apos;re gonna do this my way .
so do as i say , and she lives .
we all do .
except for caffrey .
might be too late for him .
what did you do ?
it &apos;s a sad day , peter burke .
but if you leave now , there &apos;s still time to say good @-@ bye .
do the right thing .
don &apos;t do this . do the right thing .
you got him ?
yeah .
move , move !
you need to step back , sir .
we &apos;re gonna get you out of this .
i don &apos;t think so .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t say that .
you &apos;re the only one who saw good in me .
stop it , neal .
you &apos;re my best friend .
sir ?
we need to go .
let &apos;s go ! ready ? up !
would you like to see him now ?
no , no .
it &apos;s not possible .
this isn &apos;t him .
of course not , this isn &apos;t him .
this isn &apos;t neal .
same as j.f.k. , the decoy hearse .
they took kennedy &apos;s body out of his casket
at andrews air force base and brought him
to bethesda naval hospital .
there were two different caskets .
stop it , mozzie ! just stop it !
he &apos;s gone .
no , no , because it &apos;s neal .
he can &apos;t be gone .
mozzie , he &apos;s right there .
you need to look at him . you &apos;ve gotta look , mozzie .
he &apos;s dead .
look .
it can &apos;t be him , peter .
neal always had it figured out .
there was always a way out .
it didn &apos;t matter how tight the scrape ,
neal could always slide past .
he could always get away .
not this time .
no , no , no .
no , no , no , no .
one identification badge , 16 credit cards , various names ,
12 hotel key cards , various hotels ,
a .38 @-@ caliber bullet for evidence .
one white pocket square ,
one key ,
one tracking anklet .
you &apos;re free .
you &apos;re free .
mm . almost down to 6 : 00 p.m.
it &apos;s a new record .
well , check your watch .
it &apos;s 5 : 58 . i moved it ahead five minutes .
impressive .
listen , we &apos;re closing the mortensen case tonight .
one last stakeout . you in ?
nah , nah . el &apos;s cooking dinner .
sign me up for the morning shift .
i &apos;ll bring coffee .
you know , you &apos;re the only asac i know
who turns down a dream job at white collar d.c.
to bring coffee to the stakeout team at dawn .
i could bring the baby if you &apos;d prefer .
that &apos;s what i thought .
you &apos;re in charge . make me proud .
d.c. , here she comes .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
then come with me .
brass is clamoring for the man
who brought down the pink panthers .
they want you to reconsider their offer .
yeah . this is where i belong .
can &apos;t convince you to stay ?
you &apos;d have to tell my parents
they don &apos;t get to babysit theo every day .
robbing grandparents of joy ? no , thanks .
you know , i &apos;m only 200 miles away
if you ever help on a case .
226 . i goggled it .
hey , lookee , lookee , lookee .
hey , diddle diddle , the queen &apos;s in the middle .
follow her fast . follow her slow .
you pick that little lady , and you win !
oh , too bad , honey .
better luck next time .
so any other takers ?
yeah . i &apos;ll play .
oh , okay , i gotta go .
i &apos;m out .
suit .
been a while , moz .
to what do i owe this pleasure ?
we &apos;ve got all the panthers serving life ,
but somehow , a matter of $ 23 million
went unaccounted for .
oh , that just sounds like sloppy government accounting .
mm , almost 9 million
was recovered from keller that day .
you wouldn &apos;t have any idea where the other went ?
i earn an honest living now .
i can see that .
how are you , peter ?
i see him , you know ?
his face .
i &apos;ll catch him out of the corner of my eye ,
and just for a minute , he &apos;s real .
i hear him .
&quot; hey , moz , &quot; in the roar of a subway going by
or his laugh in a taxi horn .
i turn , but he &apos;s never there .
&quot; oh , you can &apos;t help that , &quot; said the cat .
&quot; we &apos;re all mad here . &quot;
i keep telling myself , if i &apos;d just got there a minute sooner--
ah , stage three : bargaining .
myself , stage four .
depression ?
i would &apos;ve figured you for denial .
no more conspiracy theories .
look .
this is the queen he played me with the day we met .
he conned me right here on this spot .
he gave me this card just before the job ,
and for the longest time ,
i thought he knew .
he knew he was gonna die ,
so he gave me this to say good @-@ bye .
and if he knew that ,
well , it must have been a con .
neal caffrey &apos;s greatest con .
but it wasn &apos;t .
thus , i move from denial to depression .
you should stop by the house sometime .
el misses you , and you have to see the boy .
i &apos;d like that .
good .
i &apos;ll see you , haversham .
uh , winters . teddy winters .
all right , step right up ! come on , don &apos;t be shy !
who wants to win some money ?
and then using the magical box with the map inside ,
the white knight teamed up with the dark knight
to find the treasure in the submarine .
but the evil warlord got there first
and forced the knights into the submarine ,
which was booby @-@ trapped with tnt--
we can skip that part .
oh , right .
so the knights find the treasure ,
but then the warlord tricks them
and uses dark magic to make it disappear .
the end .
that &apos;s the whole story ?
yup .
i &apos;m sticking to it .
well , i think neal likes it .
don &apos;t you ? yeah .
well , he &apos;s a man with impeccable taste .
that &apos;s why he gets to keep mozart .
aw , that &apos;s sweet . thanks , moz .
oh , you didn &apos;t waste any time .
well , you told me to come by .
i did . mwah .
stay for dinner .
oh , nice try , suit .
you know i can &apos;t stay in one place for too long .
hey , suit .
yeah ?
i &apos;ll see you around .
okay .
look at you !
you stole that right off the spoon .
did you see that ?
i did .
what &apos;s that ?
uh , i don &apos;t know . it was on the stoop .
yeah , there was no note , but look at that .
nice bottle of bordeaux .
yeah .
after the day i had , mmm ,
mama &apos;s gonna have some of that .
i &apos;ll go .
no , no , no , no .
you do the dishes . i &apos;ll get neal .
that &apos;s a deal .
yeah .
neal never goes anywhere without a purpose . why here ?
what &apos;s he up to , jones ?
maybe these containers aren &apos;t a bad place to stash
$ 1 / 2 billion in cash .
a .38 @-@ caliber bullet for evidence .
you let her go , keller !
same as j.f.k , the decoy hearse ,
two different caskets .
he knew he was gonna die .
it must be a con !
neal caffrey &apos;s greatest con !
