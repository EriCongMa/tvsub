Hostage
You're gonna get us all in trouble.
He's going to be home soon, ok?
Stop!
Rose?
Rose!
Don't call me that.
How many times have I told you?
You took that when I was watching
and he's gonna blame me.
Please.
Stop that!
I'm gonna go get help.
D-don't go.
You're sick. You need help.
I'll be back.
Pinkie promise?
Ok.
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop her.
We have to go.
Where?
Now.
I need help. I can't lift her.
She'll only slow us down.
But we can't--
Come on, put her down!
Go! Now!
Last night, this girl, Gina Bryant,
flagged down a police car in St. Louis.
She was wearing nothing but a dirty nightgown
and she was barefoot.
And she told them that she had been kidnapped when she was 8.
That girl's gotta be 19 or 20 years old.
18. And they confirmed her identity.
She was a foster kid who disappeared 10 years ago.
She's been in captivity this whole time?
Long-term hostage. That's rare.
We got another Ariel Castro here?
Funny you should say that. Not funny ha ha, funny weird.
She told the police that she was held captive with this girl,
Sheila Woods, 15 years old,
who disappeared from Nashville 7 years ago.
Also she said there was another girl, too,
but all she knows about her
is that her name is Violet and she was older.
I'm assuming you've checked the missing children's database.
Affirmative. There's no Violet anywhere.
Did Gina say anything about her captor?
Just that his name is Tom and he was an older white dude.
And where were they being held?
This house. Gina took the cops there.
They found Sheila. Sheila's at the hospital,
very ill with something yet to be determined.
Violet nowhere to be found.
It's probably safe to assume that she's with the unsub.
Who owns the house?
Oh, that's where it gets even weirder.
This woman, Clara Riggins.
She's MIA, but her checking account is active,
she pays her bills on time, and if my math is correct,
she's 108 years old.
I might be going out on a limb here,
but I'm gonna bet she had nothing to do with the kidnapping.
The real question's where is the unsub
and this other girl Violet?
That's what we're gonna find out.
Can I go pee?
Soon.
When? We've been driving for hours.
Soon. I said.
I gotta go bad.
What'd I say, huh?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll hold it.
I'll be good, I promise.
Maybe I should just get rid of you.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
"By the will art thou lost,
by the will art thou found,
by the will art thou free, captive, and bound."
Angelus Silesius.
Both Gina and Sheila were grabbed when they were 8.
And both just blocks away from their homes.
And made a clean getaway each time. No witnesses.
There's an excellent chance he stalked them.
Clean getaways usually mean they know daily routines
and are familiar with the area.
So this guy's patient and has a plan.
Which means he has patterns,too.
This guy's more than just a preferential pedophile.
His victims are children,
but that's probably more about establishing control.
Long-term captivity is what matters to him.
We've seen profiles like this before.
There's always a sexual assault component to their M.O.
Hello, all. I just sent you the 4-1-1
on the statements from police reports.
Turns out the neighbors haven't seen Clara Riggins in 20 years.
Most of them didn't even know that she existed.
But they all know who this Tom guy is.
According to this one lady,
Tom told her that he was Clara's grandson.
But I triple-checked. Clara doesn't have any relatives anywhere.
Did we get a description from any of the neighbors?
Affirmative.
And they also gave me the make and model of Tom's blue van.
It's a pretty common vehicle.
I got a long list of registered owners.
So far the 3 Toms and Thomases on that list all check out.
All right, stay on it.
You know I will, sir.
When we land, Dave, you and morgan go to the house.
JJ, you and Reid are with me at the hospital.
We need to talk to the girls
and find out everything they remember.
Well, she's stable for now.
All we can do is wait.
So, just sit tight.
Agents, thank you for waiting.
Of course. How is she?
Looks like she had complications from a miscarriage.
Her infection turned septic.
We had to perform an emergency hysterectomy.
And she has several old scars on her back.
If I didn't know better, I'd say they were from a whip.
Any idea when she might wake up?
There's no way to tell.
What about Gina Bryant?
She's doing much better, all things considered.
Malnourished, dehydrated, a couple nasty cuts and bruises.
But she should be ok. Physically, anyway.
Do you think she's able to answer a few questions?
She was pretty agitated when she came in,
so we gave her a mild sedative.
But she has the same scars on her back,
and she's got a bunch of old injuries that didn't heal properly.
Broken ribs, tibia, a couple of fingers.
I hope you catch the guy who did this.
Do you feel better?
Much better. Thank you.
Ok.
Sorry I yelled.
Daddy's just got a lot on his mind, all right?
It's ok.
Hi, Gina.
My name's Jennifer.
This here is my friend Spencer.
Hi.
We're with the FBI.
Do you know what that is?
The police?
Yeah. Something like that.
I already talked to the police.
Well, we're--we're a little bit different.
Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
Can you tell me about the day you were kidnapped?
I went to the park.
I forgot my sweatshirt.
But I didn't want to go home.
Why not?
That lady Trisha was mean.
Your foster mother, Trisha? Trisha Gilmore?
Her kids, too.
They said I wasn't worth the money they made off me.
So you went to the playground to get away from them.
I went all kinds of places.
Mostly there.
What happened that day?
I saw Violet.
Violet.
The girl you were held hostage with?
She was waiting for her dad to pick her up.
And that's when he came.
Who, Tom?
Hey, girls, look what I have.
He had this little puppy.
He asked me if I wanted to give him treats.
He said he went crazy for treats.
They were in his car.
But it wasn't a car.
It was a van.
And he opened the door
and pushed me in and he hit me.
I tasted my blood, and my eyes were watery.
He said I'd better listen or he was gonna hit me again.
We drove...
We drove for a long time.
But I never saw the puppy again, though.
Never saw it.
He was so little.
I don't know where he went, though. I'm sorry.
It's ok. It's ok.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Shh...
Look what I found in the kitchen.
Bondage and torture porn.
Also found another toolbox in there.
That makes 3.
Well, you saw the guy's woodwork.
He's obviously good with his hands.
So maybe some kind of carpenter or handyman.
Check this out.
It could be OCD.
I mean, his closet is just right.
Clothes are perfectly folded.
You can even bounce a quarter off his bed.
He wants total control over every aspect of his life.
Makes sense for a sadist.
He's not gonna like being on the run.
He's gonna feel powerless.
And that's why he took Violet with him.
Sheila Woods was probably too sick to travel.
You know, Violet was the oldest and helped with the abductions.
She was probably his first victim.
Or maybe his daughter.
Well, either way, she was important to him.
You know, I also wonder, what happened to Clara Riggins?
Well, the bedroom down the hall is untouched.
Looks like it's been that way for a while.
This house is well cared for.
He looked after it.
That could be how he found this place.
Elderly woman with no family
hires someone to fix things now and then.
He's a nice guy. He does good work.
They build a relationship.
You think he took advantage of Clara Riggins.
Yeah.
Right before he murdered her.
I don't know, Rossi. This guy doesn't profile as a killer.
He likes the long game.
So maybe he just insinuates himself into her life
and waits for her to die.
And he made sure that she came to depend on him for survival
just like his victims.
Gina, do you have any idea
where Tom might be right now?
Maybe his disappearing place.
His disappearing place?
He'd always leave. I liked it when he was gone,
even though he never left much food.
Do you know where the disappearing place is?
I didn't get to go. He only took Violet
and Sheila once.
They were more special.
Why were they more special?
Because they were good.
They never fought.
But you did.
I hated to call him daddy, and I wouldn't say my name.
What do you mean, you wouldn't say your name?
Rose.
He tried to call me that.
Did Sheila or Violet every talk about the disappearing place?
It's a secret. It would make Tom mad if they did.
Well, what about Tom? Did he ever talk about it?
One time.
When he was nice.
He brought pizza.
Do you remember what he said?
That maybe one day I could go.
Then...
Then he wanted to go behind the curtain.
Sometimes I didn't fight as much after Sheila got there.
Why not?
Because we had to take care of her.
So I tried to make him happy.
But I made sure she remembered her real name
no matter what.
What about Violet? Do you know her real name?
Just--just Violet.
Sometimes he called her Vi.
Did Tom ever mention anyone named Clara?
She liked flowers. That's where we got our names.
He called Sheila Daisy.
Did you ever see Clara?
No.
But sometimes I was good
and he let me go outside at nighttime,
and we planted flowers.
He said they were for Clara.
No, it was--
It was just like any other day.
I made her lunch, I kissed her goodbye,
and then her school called wondering where she was.
Is there anyone you'd like me to contact?
Her father.
He's in Tampa.
We split up after Sheila disappeared.
Who did this to her?
Who?
Rest assured we're doing everything we can to find him.
So this one right here will turn the volume up and down.
And then this one if you want to change the channel,
if you want to watch something different.
JJ.
Here you go. I'll be right back.
Composite sketch of the unsub.
Garcia's running facial recognition
against her list of blue van owners.
How's she doing?
It's a lot.
She has no money, no family,
a second-grade education,
not to mention a lifetime of PTSD to deal with.
Clear the door, clear the door, please.
103. Code blue.
That can't be good.
Dr. Givens, room 103. Code blue.
Crash cart coming through.
Given the amount of hospital staff and the level of urgency,
it looks to me like Sheila might be coding.
What's coding?
Gina, you need to get back in bed.
Is that Sheila's room?
No, no, no. Ok, you know what?
Let them work. You don't want to get in their way.
No! You don't stop working on her! You keep working on her!
Seila! Is she ok?
No no no.
Sheila! Sheila! What's wrong?!
What's wrong with her?!
I have to help her! I have to help her!
Please! Please! Please...
What have you got, Garcia?
I have a big fat hit on our unsub.
I give you Michael Clark Thompson,
owner of Mike's Fix-it and Construction,
and there's a blue van registered in the company's name.
You sent the address?
No, it's a P.O. Box, sir,
and his cell phone is turned off.
but it last pinged last night in St. Louis,
right next to Clara Riggins' house.
Is this him?
Yeah. Get it away, please.
I'll issue the APD.
Here.
Eat. I know you're hungry.
Can we please go see them?
Shut up and eat your cheeseburger.
Now, listen.
Just let me sleep for a little while,
then I'll take you to see them.
Ok. Ok. I'll be quiet.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
I just need a few minutes.
Sweet dreams.
I thought you said you'd be quiet.
Michael Clark Thompson's mother died in childbirth,
so he grew up with his father Nate,
who was married and divorced 5 different times.
And each of exes filed for divorce
on the grounds of cruelty, adultery, or both.
Apparently his father had a predilection for prostitutes.
He was even arrested once for having assaulted one.
Now, kids do what they see.
This might explain the son's extreme misogynistic tendencies.
And his violent streak.
The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.
This man is smart, and he's manipulative.
He not only was able to
take advantage of the woman who owns this house,
but he's somehow held 3 girls hostage here for over a decade.
That took effort and dedication.
This was important to him, like a compulsion.
He gets off on having absolute power and control.
All units be advised,
APB suspect blue van
spotted on Taft Avenue and Buckley Road.
That's him.
Michael Clark Thompson, FBI!
Show me your hands!
Daddy, who is that?
Show me your hands!
Now very slowly use your right hand
to open the driver's side door.
Daddy?
Slowly.
Remember what I told you.
That if anybody ever found us,
daddy's the only one that loves you.
Get out of the van nice and slow.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
Ah, you gotta be kidding me, this guy.
Oh, god! Oh, my wrist! My wrist!
Oh, what, am I hurting you? I'm sorry.
Shut up.
It's ok. It's ok.
We got you.
She's refusing treatment.
She won't even tell us her last name.
Well, that's because she might not even remember it herself.
Violet probably isn't even her real name.
It's most likely the name he gave her.
We do need to talk to her.
Well, you can try. You might have better luck than I did.
It may take some time to get through to her.
All right, see what you can find out.
I'm gonna go question Thompson.
She's probably childlike and unsocialized, exactly like Gina.
And if she was held captive the longest,
she almost certainly fell victim to intense trauma bonding.
Hi. Violet? My name's Jennifer.
And I'm Spencer.
Uh, can we go now?
Me and my daddy, we gotta go.
When you say daddy, do you mean Tom?
I don't call him that.
You know, that's-- that's not actually his real name.
His name is Michael Clark Thompson.
Tom's just a name he made up.
Kind of like your name-- Violet.
Do you remember your real name?
I need my daddy. We need to go.
Where is it that you need to go? Maybe we can help you.
He said you would do that.
Do what?
Ask questions and lie.
Especially about him.
We know what he did to you, Violet.
Gina told us everything.
You found her?
Did you find Daisy, too?
Her real name is Sheila. Sheila Woods.
And, yes, we did.
She was super sick. Is she ok?
I'm sorry, but, no, she's not.
The doctors did everything they could,
but she didn't make it.
She died.
You don't have to be afraid of him anymore.
We can help you.
He said you would say that, too.
You don't know anything, ok?
I would be dead without him.
He's the only one who loves me.
Violet, please.
I--I gotta go. Please.
I've been good. I haven't done anything bad.
Can I go now?
Please.
I gave them a good life.
They were clothed, fed.
You repeatedly raped and tortured them.
Children need discipline.
Now, if you have kids yourself, you know what--
That wasn't discipline and they're not your children.
The hell they weren't. I saved them.
From what?
From their parents.
Nobody cared about them.
Where were they when I showed up?
No one cared about them but me.
What about Clara Riggins?
She was a nice lady.
Who seems to have disappeared.
Huh. I didn't kill her.
I didn't say that you did.
No, but obviously that's what you're thinking.
So where is she?
I went to check on her one day
and she didn't answer the door.
I had the key, so I let myself in and I found her,
just lying on the kitchen floor.
So I put her in the yard.
That's what she would have wanted.
Look, she loved that house.
She didn't want to be buried next to strangers.
You can go check if you want.
I told you, I've got nothing to hide.
Nothing to hide, my ass. He's full of it.
The preliminary M.E. report does suggest
that Clara Riggins died of natural causes.
I think he's telling the truth about that. He didn't kill her.
I'm sorry, guys. I can't stop thinking about Violet.
She could not wait to get out of here,
like it was urgent. It's all she could talk about.
Well, she'd been held captive most of her life.
All this has to be a tremendous shock.
No question about that, but that wasn't it.
It's like she had somewhere specific in mind
and she needed Thompson to go with her.
Well, he's conditioned her to depend on him for everything.
Exactly. You condition someone
by doing something over and over again.
Now, we know he repeatedly abused them.
I don't think she was itching to get out of here to go do that.
Maybe he did something to reward her somehow.
What if she has a child?
Where else would you want to go so badly?
You know, that's not a stretch.
Sheila woods had a miscarriage.
Maybe Violet brought one to term.
We did profile he might be trying to fill some kind of void
since he didn't have a family.
Yeah, but ina Bryant never mentioned any baby.
Well, Violet could have had the baby before Gina was abducted.
Gina wouldn't even know about it.
We, if we're right about any of this,
That means there's another kid somewhere out there.
Then who's taking care of it?
I wove my webs for you because I liked you.
After all, what's a life anyway?
We're born, we live a little while, we die.
A spider's life can't help being something of a mess,
with all this trapping and eating flies.
I don't want to listen anymore.
I'm hungry.
I know. Me, too.
You want to sing?
How about "A-B-Cs"?
You remember it?
Yeah.
Don't worry. I'll be right there with you.
Don't leave.
I promise.
Excuse me, Mrs. Woods.
I am so sorry to interrupt here,
but...this is Gina.
She was with Sheila.
I'm sorry.
I tried to help her.
I tried.
Yeah, Garcia.
Sir, I think I found who violet is.
The timeline matches, the geography matches,
everything matches.
Hi.
You ok?
How is daddy? Can we go soon?
Um, we're working on it.
You know, I still have a few questions I need to ask you.
Ok?
What's that thing?
Um, well, you can look at pictures on it.
Do you know this little girl?
Her name is Amelia Hawthorne,
and she is from a city called Indianapolis.
And these-- these are her parents.
That's George and Maureen.
That little girl
is you.
You're Amelia.
Um...My name is Violet.
No, sweetie.
Tom took you away from your family when you were only 8.
You have been gone for 15 years.
Tom is not your daddy.
This man is.
I--I can't even begin
to understand what you're feeling right now,
But you must be scared and confused.
I promise you, Amelia,
I am your friend.
Ok? And I'm here to help you.
You gotta trust me. Ok?
Ok.
Can you do me a favor?
I need you to think back
and try really hard to remember.
Did Tom...
Did he ever get you pregnant?
Did you have a baby, Amelia?
I can't talk about that. He gets mad.
He's not here.
He gets mad if I even ask about about--
I promised you,
I am here to help you.
Which means you never, ever have to worry about him again.
My sisters.
Your sisters?
I got super sick.
And then my belly got really big both times.
Both times? It happened twice?
And then one day, they just...
came out,
and it really hurt like crazy,
but I got my sisters.
Lily and Jasmine.
Do you know where they are right now?
Of course. They're in the disappearing place.
Do you know where that is? I can take you there.
We have to drive. Can you drive?
Yeah, but you need to tell me where to go.
Can you do that?
No. I don't know-- I don't know where it is.
I always sit in back. He drives.
Well, you might remember more than you think.
No. Daddy knows. He can drive.
Just go and get him. Go get him and we can go.
Go ahead. Take it.
What about you?
I'm ok.
He'll be back soon.
Here.
Thanks.
All right. Thank you.
The x-ray machine was down.
Thompson's going in now.
Amelia Hawthorne's parents are here.
She could barely look at their photo.
I can't imagine how she'll react in person.
Wait. Maybe we should give her more time.
Psych hasn't completed a full evaluation yet.
I mean, she could become hostile
or maybe even retreat into a catatonic state.
We don't have time. Amelia may have information
about the missing children
that her parents could help unlock.
It's a calculated risk, but one I think we have to take.
I'll go update them.
Ok.
Hi.
Did you get daddy? Is he gonna take us?
Uh, no, not yet.
Why not?
Uh, there's-- there's some people here
that would like to see you.
Amelia.
Who are they?
They're your real parents.
Baby, it's me. It's mama.
I don't know you.
I know. I look different.
So do you.
I don't know them.
See? That's how I looked back then.
And that's your dad.
And that right there...
Is you.
Do you remember?
Don't touch me.
Oh, Melly.
What did you say?
M-melly.
It's what I used to call you.
It's short for Amelia.
All right, get a hit, Melly, Melly.
Daddy's the only one that loves you.
Daddy, daddy.
Get out.
‭- Oh, baby--
Get out!
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out now!
Now! Get out!
I want to go home!
I want my daddy!
I need my daddy!
Excuse us, please.
I don't think he was done.
We know that Sheila Woods got pregnant and miscarried.
She preferred to be called Daisy.
And we know about Lily and Jasmine. Where are they?
I want a deal.
Tell me where they are
and I will make sure the court knows you cooperated.
No.
No, no, no.
I want a deal.
If we find them alive, then we can discuss terms.
Listen to me. The only reason I haven't asked for a lawyer yet
is because I hate those lying sons of bitches.
Now, you either give me a
damn deal right now or I ain't sayin' boo.
What do you want?
That's better.
I want to do my time in minimum security.
One of those places where they send the white collar guys,
with the TVs and the gyms.
And no life sentence.
I won't die in there.
‭- Is that all?
No.
I want to see Violet.
That's not happening.
Come on. What are you telling me,
she didn't ask for me, not even once?
Ok. All right.
You let your pride get in the way.
Lily, Jasmine, I only left them enough water for a few days
and I've been gone almost a week.
But that's on your head, not mine.
Are we really gonna make a deal with this guy?
I don't think we have a choice.
You think he's telling the truth
about their food and water?
I do. And I think we're running out of time.
Are we even sure the A.U.S.A. will approve a deal?
They just did.
Well, do her parents know about this?
JJ's talking to them now.
I think I have a way to use their presence
to try to get through to her.
I'm so sorry, I just can't...
I just can't leave her yet.
I understand. Take as much time as you need.
Is that him?
Yes.
Daddy.
Hi, Vi.
Have a seat.
No, I want to be close to her.
Not part of the deal.
Then give us some privacy.
Not part of the deal, either.
Sit.
You got 5 minutes.
You're hurt.
Don't worry about that. It's nothing.
I'm really sorry.
About what?
My sisters.
I had to tell them. Please don't be mad. I had to.
Now, listen, it's all right, Vi.
Ok? It really is ok.
Did you get the groceries yet?
No, honey, I've been here the whole time just like you.
But can we go now?
I have some bad news.
We can't go there today.
We can't go there ever again.
But -- no -- we have to go to the store,
and it's close by the disappearing place.
And we can be fast.
You're right, you're right, Violet, but I can't.
These police, they don't think we should be together.
They're gonna break apart
our family just like I told you they would.
No.
I just wanted to come in and say goodbye
before they took me away.
Wait, when will you be back?
Not for a very long time.
A very long time.
I would give you a hug goodbye,
but they -- they won't let me.
No! I -- please...
Please, can I just hug him?
Ok.
Oh, Violet, I'm gonna miss you.
My beautiful Violet.
My beautiful Violet.
What is -- what is this? Who are these people?
These are her parents.
And that gentleman right there is her real daddy.
She knows who her real daddy is.
Daddy is the only one who loves you.
Isn't that right, Violet?
I love you, Melly. I love you, Melly.
No.
My name...
is...
Amelia.
Amelia.
Amelia.
Go--
Amelia!
No! No!
My name's Amelia!
There's no deal. You hear me?
There's no deal!
Oh, thank...
Ok, so, this is a little bit of a long shot,
but you said Violet asked if Thompson
had gotten the groceries yet?
Yeah, she said the store was right by the disappearing place.
Well, we profiled he's a control freak.
He likes order, which means there's a good chance
he went to the same grocery store every time.
If we can figure out which one, we can narrow the search.
Well, he would need the same kind of space,
and he would want it close.
Sir, yes, sir.
Garcia, I need a list of
clients of Michael Clark Thompson in the area.
Me thinks I can do that. Let's see.
Bank accounts, invoices...
Bam. 83 names. That is a scary long list.
All right, Garcia,
you can eliminate anyone under the age of 70.
And they wouldn't just need to be elderly clients.
They could also be disabled in some way.
Anyone he could take advantage of.
Oh. 12 names, then.
How many of them live near a grocery store?
Define near.
Uh, within a mile.
Well, there are 163 grocery stores
in the greater St. Louis area.
Two of them do. First up
is 91-year-old Herman Coker.
He is a retired cop, World War II vet.
No, I don't think it's him
because he's got a very active facebook account,
thanks to his youngest daughter Jan who lives with him.
Ok, who else you got, mama?
Hold yourself.
Fredna Nasee. Oh, not much on her.
She's a retired nurse. 84 years old.
She's got a daughter that lives in Boca Raton.
Uh, they -- they don't communicate.
No phone calls, no emails, nothing.
Send us the address.
Done.
Morgan and JJ, check it out.
FBI!
Clear.
Wake up. I think they're here.
Clear.
Jasmine, wake up.
Wake up, somebody's here.
Jasmine, wake up! Jasmine, wake up! Wake up!
It's ok. It's ok. We're here to help.
Are you Lily? And this is Jasmine?
I can't wake her up.
I'll call for an ambulance.
I missed you so much!
Love you.
You're here.
You look pretty.
You're gonna need to be patient with her.
This might take a little time.
Yeah, I know.
Stand up.
We found them both, alive.
Too bad you took that deal off the table.
You'd be well on your way to club Fed right about now.
Yeah, but don't you worry.
You're gonna make a lot of friends.
They're gonna love you out in the yard.
