the cure to vampirism .
i knew you wanted it for elena .
what if i don &apos;t want it for her now ?
if anyone tries to flip my humanity switch back on ,
i &apos;ll become your worst nightmare .
ty , stop !
hello , mother .
you believe that i can reconnect stefan with his humanity ?
and once we &apos;ve done that ,
then we will go rescue my friends ?
they were known as heretics ,
vampires with witch power .
that woman made me a monster
and then abandoned me .
who &apos;s that ?
damon &apos;s lame attempt to get my humanity back on .
and let me guess-- then you get my humanity back on .
i don &apos;t think so .
i will never leave you again .
mother .
you have to go after caroline .
i &apos;ll find her .
an angel .
how cute is this place ?
adorable .
ok . so i &apos;ll bite .
so you hunt me down in a bar ,
where i am perfectly content feeding on the wait staff
so you can whine to me about how your mom is a bitch--
what kind of mother doesn &apos;t love her own children ?
whatever . so she spun you a web of lies
and couldn &apos;t flip your humanity switch back on ,
and now you want to eat people ,
which i am totally down for .
so ... what the hell are we doing in a b &amp; b in grove hill ?
well , i figure we could
take a little break .
first step--convince her that my humanity is still off .
i &apos;ll tell her that my run @-@ in with our mother had no effect on me
and i want to keep the party going .
look at that .
st. stefan has a plan .
let me guess-- whoever &apos;s holding the kitten
gets to talk about their feelings .
torture her until she breaks .
sold .
so do i need to remind you two that
the last time caroline thought
that we were trying to flip her switch
she went on a killing spree ?
well , she &apos;s not gonna find out this time .
who are you calling ?
can i get some towels sent up to the room , please ?
thank you .
i &apos;m hungry , so i figure we can eat whoever brings them up .
see ? he &apos;ll be convincing .
fine . say she believes you .
how do you know she &apos;s gonna even want to see you again ?
oh , she &apos;ll want to see him .
damon , shut up .
i mean , it &apos;s a bit of a tricky bet for you , isn &apos;t it , brother ?
she &apos;s gonna expect a lot .
ok . what am i missing here ?
nothing .
hang on a second .
did you and caroline--
do it ? yep .
this was after she flipped-- never mind .
it &apos;s not exactly how i wanted things to go down ,
but i can &apos;t change it now ,
so can we just drop it ?
ok . sore subject . understood .
so what do we do once you earn her trust ?
we drain her of her blood ,
make her weak , and then bombard her
with everything she used to care about--
memories of who she was ,
her friendships , her mom .
did you bring it ?
yes .
what is that ?
caroline got rid of everything from her former life .
her mom had sent this letter ,
intending for it to arrive after she died ,
which it did ,
but caroline had already flipped her switch .
it could work .
sure . unless she wants sexy stefan time
instead of an assault on memory lane .
i &apos;m not gonna let that happen .
now what are you doing ?
just making us some drinks .
such a gentleman .
dinner .
towels !
sure you want to do this ?
let &apos;s just get it over with .
stefan ?
yeah .
what happened ?
we got caught .
hello .
this is a surprise .
well , you know , i was just in the hood .
i thought i might stop by
and bring my friend a little morning pick @-@ me @-@ up .
thanks . what is this ?
uh , it &apos;s a mocha latte frappa somethin &apos; .
i don &apos;t know . i guessed .
clearly . so elena told me that
you guys found caroline , which is great .
funny enough , she didn &apos;t mention anything
about a cure for vampirism ?
please don &apos;t tell me you said anything .
i didn &apos;t . apparently , neither have you .
well , yeah . look . i &apos;ve been busy , you know ?
my mom &apos;s in town .
i had to vampire @-@ proof a b &amp; b .
do you have any idea how many people
i had to compel to make that happen ?
quite a few i am assuming ,
which makes me wonder how you had time
to bring your bud a coffee , hmm ?
you ever hear of april lyrids ?
yeah , me neither . anyway , it &apos;s a stupid comet
that my mom thinks that she &apos;s gonna use
to pull her friends out of the 1903 prison world .
ok , but we &apos;re not letting her people out .
well , i may have reinforced that possibility
when i gave the ascendant to her for safekeeping .
you what ? !
come here .
damon , you were the one that said her friends
are vampires who can do magic .
i think the pc term is witchpire .
the term is freaks we &apos;ve never dealt with before .
but it doesn &apos;t matter because she still needs you
to do the spell to open up the door to 1903 , bonnie .
so that means she &apos;s gonna come looking for me .
so we stall her .
look . lily &apos;s like a bill collector .
you dodge her calls long enough ,
she &apos;ll leave you alone .
no . eventually , they shut your power off .
you better fix this before she becomes my problem .
and don &apos;t ever show up here pretending to care about me again !
did i tell you ?
i got us into that cute bakery right off campus .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
to taste wedding cake
for our wedding .
i don &apos;t need to remind you .
right around the corner .
is this where i pretend to care
about how our wedding cake tastes ?
i just pulled a rummy all @-@ nighter
at a b &amp; b we &apos;re supposed to be scouting for the wedding .
you can care about cake .
did i mention that the cute bakery
is right next door to an even cuter tequila bar ?
tequila . my favorite .
gin . again .
how many is that ?
elena !
we were just keeping a really close eye on your friends .
yeah . real close .
yeah . i can see that .
yeah .
good news ! your shift &apos;s over .
i &apos;m here to relieve you .
in that case , i &apos;m just gonna head to the honeymoon suite .
uh , supplies are right here .
uh , cards are right there
just in case you get bored .
supplies , cards , got it .
yeah . great . so we &apos;ll see you in a few hours .
ric ?
yeah ?
it &apos;s really nice to see you happy .
oh , thanks .
i think they &apos;re awake , so ...
have fun with that .
ok .
they vampire @-@ proofed a b &amp; b .
how did they even know we were here ?
why are you so calm ?
help me .
because i already tried .
you &apos;re wasting your energy .
every move i make
feels like sandpaper rubbing against my veins .
they &apos;re drying us out .
first they drain our blood ,
then they starve us .
i know how desiccation works , stefan .
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
i can literally feel
my cells shrinking .
you do realize that vodka
to a desiccating vampire is like salt water to a human ?
what &apos;s with the lecture ?
just shut up
and let me enjoy this .
knock , knock .
elena . let me guess--
humanity police was your idea .
we really want you back , caroline .
remember that time jeremy died
and you turned off your humanity
and tried to kill the prom queen ,
aka your best friend bonnie ?
i forget . stefan , was that
before or after she killed some waitress for no reason ?
i think it was after .
you see , stefan and i are just finding it a little ironic that
you think you &apos;re qualified
to tell us how to deal with the death of a loved one .
i &apos;m not here to preach to you , caroline .
i just came to show you this .
this letter from your mom
arrived at our dorm just a few days after her funeral .
apparently there was something she wanted to tell you .
does this look real to you ?
her impeccably perfect handwriting ?
yep . i remember when she taught me
how to write my name in cursive .
so what , am i supposed to read this
and snap back to sad , pathetic , motherless caroline ?
burn it .
what ?
did i say , &quot; stand there and look stupid &quot; ?
no . i said , &quot; burn it . &quot;
well , maybe i should read it first .
why do you care ?
i mean , what happens if eventually you get your humanity back
and you hate me for destroying
the last thing your mom wanted to say to you ?
did those words seriously just come out of your mouth ?
god !
burn it !
now !
stefan , don &apos;t !
no !
sorry , elena ,
but if you want us back ,
you &apos;re gonna have to try a lot harder than that .
hey , matt .
can i assume that the woman who looks like
she &apos;s never been in a restaurant before
is your lunch date ?
great . she &apos;s early .
so what do you want me to do ?
just wait 10 minutes ,
tell her i &apos;m running late ,
and stall her till i find what i need .
ok .
thought you were off learning to be a sheriff .
thanks to stefan and caroline ,
i can barely tie my shoe at the moment .
what , are you here to stalk someone ?
i &apos;m through with all that .
i &apos;ve decided a direct approach is best .
one of your diners owes me some answers .
i can &apos;t have any trouble in here , man .
that will depend on how this conversation goes .
i know you .
you came to my house a few days ago .
yes , and as chance would have it ,
your son and i are old friends .
my god .
lorenzo . it &apos;s you .
so you two know each other ?
the phrase &quot; small world &quot; comes to mind .
so does &quot; epic understatement . &quot;
uh , my lunch companion has yet to arrive .
won &apos;t you join me for a drink ?
don &apos;t mind if i do .
she burned the letter .
that was my ace in the hole .
i blew it .
look .
the fact that you suck at torturing people
is nothing to be ashamed of .
that &apos;s why you have me .
well , at least alaric and jo can cross this
off their list of honeymoon options .
they have a list ?
jo &apos;s pregnant .
they didn &apos;t want to have to fly anywhere ?
do you have a list ?
of where i &apos;d go on my fictional honeymoon
before i give birth to my fictional baby ?
no .
but not here .
i thought you liked this place .
really ?
what part of extreme floral patterns
screams elena gilbert to you ?
well , excuse me , missy .
i guess we &apos;ve never played the
let &apos;s pretend we &apos;re human fantasy game together .
all right . let &apos;s play .
you &apos;re human .
5 years from now , where are you ?
easy . with you .
boring . i &apos;ll need a zip code .
ok . uh , in a loft in tribeca
above the bar that you work at .
you made me matt donovan in your fantasy ?
ok . you ... you own the bar ,
and when you &apos;re not working there ,
you &apos;re--you &apos;re on our couch ,
pouring me wine and
massaging my feet after a long day at the o.r.
i &apos;m in the surgical residency program .
of course you are .
kids ?
yeah , of course , eventually ,
but we should , um , probably have two ,
you know , so they can keep each other company
when we &apos;re , you know , distracted by other things .
you got it all figured out , don &apos;t you ?
how about you ? your turn .
5 years from now , where are you ?
this is torture !
sounds like the rats are restless .
like , actual torture .
elena and damon talking about their future together .
just--i want to die .
they &apos;ll make a mistake eventually ,
and when they do , we will pounce
and drain the first person we can get our teeth on .
oh , my god . what i would do for just a sip of human blood .
you know when you &apos;re feeding on someone &apos;s neck
and their artery &apos;s still pulsing ?
i really love that .
i thought your veins felt like sandpaper .
they do .
so take my mind off it .
bored yet ?
go away , damon .
brought you some real light reading from the true crime section .
curious--which one of you idiots
attacked a stadium security guard
and stuffed him in a laundry cart ?
that would have been me .
nice technique ,
although it &apos;s probably good that your mom &apos;s gone
that would have been a hell of a cover @-@ up .
why are you only picking on me ?
stefan &apos;s in here , too . annoy him .
because stefan didn &apos;t snap a barback &apos;s clavicle in half .
you know , it &apos;s really quite sad actually .
i can see liz right now ,
calling the parents , breaking the news ,
wondering where she went wrong as a mother .
she got cancer , damon .
that is where she went wrong .
blame her .
healthy attitude , caroline .
you know what ? you &apos;re right .
i should really just be more like you and elena ,
just play make @-@ believe about the future that i can &apos;t have
because that &apos;s healthy .
maybe i &apos;ll pretend i can actually give birth to babies
and have a normal family ,
and i can get a job
without having to move and start over every 5 years .
i can operate on my patients without wanting to feed on them .
you &apos;re a real bitch when you &apos;re hungry .
i &apos;m curious , damon .
how does it feel to know
that you can &apos;t give someone the life that she really wants ?
shut up , caroline .
i &apos;m just stating the facts , elena .
you didn &apos;t want this life .
you can play fantasy land all you want ,
but in this life , the one where you &apos;re a vampire ,
you &apos;ll always be settling ,
and it &apos;s just so sad .
i can &apos;t listen to this .
elena .
i don &apos;t want to hear it , ok ?
may i please have a chicken sandwich
and a bowl of soup ?
you bet , and that comes with a side of fries or skins .
um , i &apos;m sorry . did you say skins ?
i--i &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know what that is .
neither , thanks , and i &apos;m not eating .
that was painful .
what &apos;s the matter ? your all @-@ blood diet
make you forget how restaurants work ?
my first time actually .
how did i do ? was i a blithering idiot ?
what are you talking about ?
oh , i figured you were aware .
i &apos;ve been imprisoned for the last 100 years .
that old chestnut .
lily , you turned me
and left me on a passenger ship full of headless corpses .
wouldn &apos;t it be easier to say you forgot what cabin number i was in ?
if only that were the case .
no . the night i turned you ,
my friends and i were captured by the gemini coven .
oh , i see .
all this time , you thought that i abandoned you .
i would never do that , lorenzo .
i will thank you not to mention headless corpses again .
those habits are all in the past .
at least it gives you and stefan something to bond over .
or maybe not .
it &apos;s not their fault ,
but they remind me of a very dark time in my life .
not one for the maternal instincts , i see .
on the contrary .
they were directed elsewhere .
you see , i was trapped in that prison world with 6 others ,
caring for them as we starved ,
surviving on two drops of blood a week
just to preserve our rations .
sounds like a chore .
loyalty is never a chore , lorenzo .
at any rate , it &apos;s ill @-@ bred
to speak of such personal matters .
i do hope you &apos;re hungry .
it--it appears my lunch date has stood me up--
bonnie bennett .
you see , my traveling companions
remain trapped in that prison world .
miss bennett has offered to get them out .
oh , has she now ?
still looking .
she &apos;s gone .
i told you to stall her .
i couldn &apos;t . she was with enzo .
when did they leave ?
i don &apos;t know , but you better hurry up .
do you know how many places there are
to hide things in this house ?
so kind of you to bring me home .
bonnie , are you ok ?
still , i think you &apos;re wrong to worry about the ascendant .
damon assured me all would be well .
you &apos;ve got a lot to learn about your son .
what do you mean by that ?
eh , he &apos;s not the most trustworthy chap .
figured you were aware .
is this entertaining to you ...
that the ascendant has been taken from me ,
that i &apos;ve lost the only means of rescuing my family ?
your family ?
you know what i am , lorenzo .
you saw the horror on that ship .
the people in that prison world are
the only thing that keep me
from becoming that monster again .
your real family is right here
in this house .
get out .
lily , relax .
i said get out !
damon , caroline &apos;s not right .
i &apos;m not settling .
but you do want to be human .
you said it yourself .
if i was human , we wouldn &apos;t work .
exactly . it wouldn &apos;t work .
human you chose stefan .
why are you acting like this ?
just admit what you really want , elena .
what do you want me to say , damon ?
you want me to say that i &apos;m never gonna be
100 % ok with being a vampire for the rest of eternity ?
fine , but i &apos;m ok with that
because then that means i get to be with you forever ,
and just the thought of that
is good enough for me .
why isn &apos;t it good enough for you ?
oh , good . mommy dearest .
i &apos;ll let you take that .
this better be a pocket dial .
where have you been ?
what are you-- my mother ?
is it with you ?
is what with me ?
the ascendant .
it &apos;s not where i left it ,
and i very much doubt the housekeeper took it .
maybe you misplaced it .
it is the only thing that can get my people back .
i did not misplace it .
well , i don &apos;t have it ,
so start pulling up pillow cushions .
you have not heard me , son .
i need it back .
it &apos;s really not a priority on my list of problems right now , mother .
find it ,
or rest assured , i can just as easily destroy
something of great significance to you .
tucked inside a shoebox .
clearly you &apos;ve learned the art of hiding from your mother .
you wouldn &apos;t do that .
bring me the ascendant ,
or i will crush the cure to vampirism with my own hand .
it &apos;s like a million degrees in here .
tell me about it .
he speaks .
you were so quiet earlier when i was tearing into elena .
i was scared you were feeling bad for her .
no . it was just hard to get a word in , that &apos;s all .
much better .
i highly recommend it .
i &apos;m good . thank you .
are you sure ?
because i can give you a hand if you want .
i said i &apos;m good .
i heard you .
you know what else i hear ?
your heart ,
and it &apos;s racing .
am i making you nervous ?
caroline .
when did you flip it back ?
what are you talking about ?
your humanity &apos;s been back on this whole time , hasn &apos;t it ?
damon and elena knew where to find us
because you told them ,
and that &apos;s why they were only picking on me .
you must be having heatstroke .
how dumb do you think i am , stefan ?
a few days ago , you tore my clothes off .
now you don &apos;t even want to kiss me ?
what &apos;s wrong , hmm ?
what , you don &apos;t want to take advantage of me ?
you don &apos;t want to ruin our nonexistent relationship ?
please stop .
relax , stefan .
i don &apos;t really feel like kissing anymore .
incendia .
phesmatos de strutos avox addellum .
do not take another step .
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing , bonnie .
i know exactly what i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m protecting myself .
for the first time , i &apos;m putting me first .
look . i &apos;m all about girl power ,
but just give me the damn ascendant ,
and i promise you kai will not get out .
you promise me ?
is that supposed to mean something ?
this isn &apos;t about kai anymore .
the people that that this would free
are a million times stronger than him and us ,
and don &apos;t get me started on the fun
they would have with a newly human elena .
my mom has the cure , bonnie .
what are you talking about ?
if i don &apos;t bring her that , she &apos;s gonna destroy it .
so your own mother is leveraging you ?
guess the apple doesn &apos;t fall far from the tree .
phesmatos de strutos avox addellum .
stop !
if i hand this over to you ,
i am sacrificing myself again ,
i &apos;m risking my life again .
i could end up dead again !
you don &apos;t want to push me , bon bon .
what do you want , for elena to have a human life ,
to be happy , to grow old without you ?
if that &apos;s what you really wanted ,
you would have given her the cure by now .
am i wrong ?
i said , &quot; am i wrong ? &quot;
i know you , damon .
i spent 4 months with you ,
day in and day out .
we went to hell and back again literally ,
and you &apos;re more scared now
than i have ever seen you before .
it &apos;s not about what happens if you don &apos;t give elena the cure .
you &apos;re scared about what happens if you do .
if you think you can handle it ,
free a bunch of people who will want to kill me
and anyone else who tries to stand in their way ,
and then you can spend the next 70 years
watching elena grow old and die .
if that &apos;s what you want ,
take it .
oh , thank god .
snack time .
step out of the car .
mom , what are you--
i said get out of the car .
you &apos;re under arrest for the murders
of chris benton , jason hughes--
mom , it &apos;s me . it &apos;s caroline .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re mistaken .
my daughter &apos;s kind , compassionate .
she looks after those in need .
you &apos;re not real . you can &apos;t be real .
i raised my daughter to be a good person .
stop ! i know what you &apos;re doing .
and she knows how hurt i would be to see her this way .
shut up ! stop !
you can &apos;t be here .
you are not my daughter !
i know what you &apos;re doing to me , stefan .
my mom died . she &apos;s dead .
this isn &apos;t real .
it &apos;s working .
the pain you &apos;re feeling , let it in .
starve me , bleed me out ,
put visions in my head ?
that was your plan all along ?
you need to come back now , caroline .
just get away from me .
i want to show you something .
just take my hand .
i said get away from me .
i can help you if you let me .
just please take my hand .
please , caroline .
i don &apos;t want your help , stefan .
i just want you to die .
your heart &apos;s racing again , stefan .
let me fix that .
caroline , please stop .
ok .
needle and thread as requested .
do i want to know why you suddenly decided to take up sewing ?
well , caroline and i spent the entire day
digging in the woods to find a teddy bear ,
and now she wants to repair it .
she &apos;s very task @-@ oriented .
yes , i am aware .
thank you .
what the hell is this ?
it -- it &apos;s a memory , a real one .
thank you .
you , uh , should have seen the look on caroline &apos;s face
when that bear fell apart .
you &apos;re a good friend to her , stefan .
i hope someday you &apos;ll be more than that .
i &apos;m dying .
i &apos;m allowed to be blunt .
it &apos;s a time saver .
well , i don &apos;t think the timing is right
for me and caroline right now with everything going on .
oh , blame me , why don &apos;t you ?
no . i just mean if i &apos;m gonna start something with caroline ,
i want it to be perfect--
no loss , no pain , no grief .
you might be waiting a while .
i &apos;m a patient guy .
do you want me to mail that out for you ?
no , thanks . i &apos;m still working on it .
i &apos;ll mail it out tomorrow .
i have an idea of what i want to say .
it &apos;s just ...
i guesg i want it to be perfect , too .
you &apos;re a good mom .
i hope so .
i want to see the rest .
let me see her !
wait , wait .
mom !
mom ! it &apos;s me ! it &apos;s caroline .
just come outside .
i want to talk to you .
i want to read your letter !
please . mommy !
mom , please .
come back .
make her come back .
i can &apos;t .
no . just show me the vision again , ok ?
i--i want to see my mom , stefan .
i--i need to know what she said in that letter .
i already gave you the letter .
no .
no .
no !
what do you think she wanted to tell me ?
whatever it was , it &apos;s gone .
no .
i did this .
this is all my fault .
no .
i tried to kill you ,
and then i made you turn it off ,
and then we-- oh , my god .
it &apos;s ok , caroline . it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m so sorry , stefan .
i ruined everything .
i ruined everything .
tell me you have the ascendant .
i can &apos;t because i don &apos;t .
then you understand what &apos;s going to happen next .
oh , it will just be like old times .
i screw up , and you punish me for it .
some things never change .
spare me your indignation .
we both know i did you a favor .
that sense of relief you feel right now ,
that &apos;s the realization that elena will never leave you .
you made her choice for her .
there &apos;s no harm in that .
as long as you &apos;re happy ,
she never needs to know .
although , wait a minute .
making elena yours forever ,
that &apos;s exactly what you want .
that wouldn &apos;t be a punishment at all .
damon !
damon , is this--
the cure to vampirism .
i left it out for you to find
since damon was never going to offer it to you .
is that true ?
elena , i can explain .
looks like you two have a lot to talk about .
how is she ?
what are you doing ?
i am going home for a shower and a stiff drink .
what about caroline ?
she doesn &apos;t want to see me .
stefan , every emotion she &apos;s been pushing away
just came racing back at a 100 miles an hour .
yeah . i don &apos;t need a lesson on how the humanity switch works , ric .
trust me . she doesn &apos;t want to see me .
maybe you should let caroline decide what she needs .
caroline--
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t .
you ok ?
how can i be ok after everything that i ruined ?
just don &apos;t worry about me .
i &apos;m not gonna turn it off again ,
but you ... and ...
us ...
this ...
i just really need to get out of here .
you came .
in 1903 , i was sick .
my own family had abandoned me ,
and you took me under your wing and rescued me from death .
as it turns out , loyalty is important to me , too .
they make cars so quiet now .
one hardly hears them coming .
i was out for a walk to clear my head .
i very nearly caused an accident .
i apologized of course ,
but i &apos;d given the driver quite a shock
by walking in front of his car .
his heart was beating like a drum .
i could see the pulse in his neck ,
and in that moment , i forgot all my troubles .
i felt no pain ,
no despair ,
no loneliness .
i fear it got the best of me .
what have i done ?
what have i done ? !
it &apos;s ok .
you &apos;re ok .
so that whole 5 years from now game and
all that talk about our future ?
not so subtle in hindsight , was it ?
i mean , i get it , but if i take this ,
everything changes .
i just never thought i would see it again .
that makes two of us .
my mother threatened to destroy that today ...
and i didn &apos;t stop her .
why not ?
because your fantasy of 5 years from now scared the hell out of me .
i panicked .
damon , it was just a stupid game .
all i see in 5 years from now is you .
you see your entire future .
and i want you to have that .
i want you to live in a big city
and be a surgeon and have a family .
then why would you keep it a secret from me for so many days
and then try to have it destroyed ?
because i &apos;m an idiot
and i &apos;m selfish
i &apos;m so in love with you
and i don &apos;t want to lose you .
it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s just too complicated .
we &apos;re gonna give it to somebody else .
bonnie &apos;s mom
or caroline .
already tried to pawn it off .
fine , i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a long list of vampires
who would give anything for a do @-@ over .
you &apos;re gonna take the cure , elena .
well , i don &apos;t want it , damon .
i don &apos;t want to live without you either .
you &apos;re gonna take the cure , elena .
and i &apos;m gonna take it with you .
what ? !
i don &apos;t want to face my future without you .
i &apos;ll become human too .
