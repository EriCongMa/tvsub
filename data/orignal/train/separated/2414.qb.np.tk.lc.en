he &apos;s dead .
no , no ! i can &apos;t , i can &apos;t !
turn it off .
her humanity , damon .
that was all she had left .
humanity means nothing
when you don &apos;t have anyone to care about , stefan .
i know how to bring jeremy back .
it &apos;s called an expression triangle .
i need to complete it for silas .
the nutty professor has got her totally brainwashed .
you &apos;ve had 36 people killed ?
no . i &apos;ve had 24 people killed ...
12 people at the young farm , 12 hybrids .
you and i are gonna complete the triangle .
well , i was looking for answers ,
and all i found was your professor shane , dead .
i think silas followed us back from that island .
you and i , we are the beginning .
the cure . i know someone has it .
katherine .
the doppelganger ?
where are you right now ?
in the boonies looking for a dead vampire
that might lead to katherine and the cure .
damon ?
will ?
hey , buddy .
everyone just needs to stop telling me
that i need to feel .
be honest . you like me better like this .
so where are we going ?
a place every newbie vampire
should go at least once in their life .
new york .
you were right .
told you .
that was really good .
yeah ?
glad you liked it .
yeah . thanks for inviting me .
do it again next weekend ?
if you &apos;re lucky .
oh , god . is he--
do you think he &apos;s dead ?
i don &apos;t know .
stay there .
oh , my god !
you &apos;re that serial killer , aren &apos;t you ?
the son of sam .
son of giuseppe ,
but close enough .
no !
you dragged me all the way to new york
because you were feeling nostalgic ?
no . i dragged you to new york
because in a matter of 3 days
you managed to piss off everyone in mystic falls .
a little more difficult to do in a city of millions .
i was hungry .
you were reckless .
emotionless . there &apos;s a difference .
look . all that matters is that when i lived here
i fed like crazy and had a blast
and went undetected for years .
so we &apos;re just here to have fun ?
what &apos;s the catch ?
there &apos;s no catch .
look . you wanted out . i got you out .
you wanted to feed ,
i brought you to a city @-@ sized all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet .
that &apos;s the beauty of new york .
there &apos;s so much life
that a little death goes unnoticed .
come on . let &apos;s go get some lunch .
wait . what do you mean you took her to new york ?
and that tone is the reason i didn &apos;t pick up the phone
the first 20 times you called .
where is she now ?
out exploring . maybe she &apos;s eating a hot dog ...
vendor .
so i take it your search for katherine is off .
relax , man . this little joy ride is actually a cure hunt .
that vampire that katherine sent after hayley is a friend of mine .
he lived in the city .
will gets vampires fake identities ,
and i &apos;m sure that katherine &apos;s one of his clients .
and elena &apos;s ok with this little field trip ?
just yesterday , she was living the vampire high life .
she doesn &apos;t want the cure .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t tell her .
damon , if she finds out you &apos;re still looking for it ,
she &apos;ll bolt .
i &apos;m aware of that , stefan .
what i &apos;m hoping is she &apos;s gonna be so wasted on booze and blood
that she won &apos;t even think about it .
don &apos;t underestimate her .
if i can handle you when you flip your switch ,
i can handle her . trust me .
listen to me . she &apos;s ruthless without her humanity .
the cure &apos;s the fastest way to get it back .
just be a good brother and keep mystic falls afloat for me
and let me do my thing .
you &apos;ve got an immortal named silas to deal with , remember ?
desperate times i take it .
what are you doing here ?
not judging you for starters ,
although if you are determined to get drunk ,
then perhaps i might recommend something a little more sanitary .
well , then . you showed me .
shouldn &apos;t you be out chasing tyler to the ends of the earth ,
or are there some hopes and dreams
you want to crush around here ?
depends . do you happen to know where the young brutus is ?
i know where he &apos;s not--with me .
he gave matt the deed to the house ,
so he &apos;s gone for good .
tyler made it his life &apos;s mission to kill me .
you can &apos;t hate me for driving him away .
no . i can , and i do .
now if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;d like to get back to spiraling ,
so go away .
actually , i asked him to be here .
we need his help . i think silas is in mystic falls .
ok . come on . take a deep breath .
and 5 , 4--
i can &apos;t do this .
bonnie , relax , ok ? trust me .
how can i trust you if you won &apos;t show me your real face ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s a little creepy
that you &apos;re appearing as my dead professor ?
i told you that i &apos;m silas ,
i told you shane died on the island .
i &apos;m trying to earn your trust .
all right . look .
you invited me into your home , right ?
why ?
why &apos;d you lie to your friends and tell them everything was fine ?
why did you convince your dad
that you needed professor shane &apos;s help to control your magic ?
what am i doing here ?
you &apos;re in my head .
you &apos;re making me see things and do things .
hey . now . see ? look . i &apos;m strong ,
but you &apos;re a witch ,
and i can &apos;t force you to do anything
that you don &apos;t already want to do .
you care about jeremy , right ?
i do .
yeah . you were with him ,
and you promised to protect him ,
but you failed ,
and now in order to bring him back ...
i need to get rid of the other side .
you are descended from qetsiyah ,
one of the most powerful witches of all time .
only you can complete the triangle
and cast the spell .
completing the triangle means killing 12 people .
12 people you can bring back .
bonnie , you can do this
for jeremy .
so some blood went missing from a few hospitals .
what about elena ?
don &apos;t vampires with their humanity off
tend to overindulge in human blood ,
or were you the exception ?
it &apos;s not elena .
well , let &apos;s say for a moment that it was silas .
i &apos;m struggling to see how this affects me .
look . silas wants to die and be reunited with his one true love ,
but he &apos;s supernatural ,
so if he takes the cure and dies ,
he gets stuck on the other side .
how shakespearian .
but if he destroys the other side altogether ,
he can take the cure , die , and pass on ,
but in destroying it ,
every dead supernatural being
will return to our side .
that means every werewolf , every witch ,
every vampire .
i wonder how many of those you personally killed .
care yet ?
my interest is piqued .
how do we stop him ?
bonnie said silas needs to complete 3 massacres to do this spell .
before professor shane died ,
he convinced the pastor to blow up the council .
next , he had you kill your hybrids ,
and now he only needs one more massacre ,
so if he &apos;s here , that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing .
we need to find him .
looks about right .
i was promised hedonism .
well , it &apos;s early .
hedonism isn &apos;t a big fan of the sunlight .
or soap .
easy , judgy .
not everybody got a hot new haircut today .
give it a couple of hours .
this place will be crawling with more punked @-@ out nihilists
than you can eat in a decade , trust me .
how do you know ?
because i spent most of the seventies here .
the factory was too clean ,
cbgb &apos;s was too high @-@ profile ,
but billy &apos;s-- billy &apos;s was
the underground of the underground .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 !
there you go .
two for one . rock &apos; n &apos; roll .
that &apos;s the third 5 &apos; 7 &quot; brunette i &apos;ve gotten from you , billy boy .
is that the same client ?
she &apos;s a runner .
some vampires need more identities than others .
hey ! watch what you &apos;re doing !
what the hell ?
hey . be discrete .
i kill people and give you their i.d.s ,
you let me feed in your club .
discretion was never part of the deal .
lexi ?
you &apos;re gonna feed on him right here ?
you &apos;re getting sloppy , damon .
you got lexied ?
following a lead without me ?
poor form , damon .
i have to say i &apos;m a little hurt , damon .
i thought we made a good team .
not without its fireworks , but what classic pairing isn &apos;t ?
wait . what the hell are you talking about ?
damon &apos;s following a lead to the cure .
i &apos;m following him .
notice your name never came up .
you &apos;re doing what ?
how does it feel to be wrong all the time ?
i brought elena here to feed .
i mean , mystic falls isn &apos;t exactly vamp xanadu right now .
right . so you drove 7 hours to new york city ?
yes , and as i was explaining to elena
before we were so rudely interrupted ,
that my history in this city
has a particular resonance to her current situation .
when i had my humanity off .
that explains it .
your switch is flipped .
ugh . would you mind ?
i can &apos;t even hear my prey over your constant babbling .
you &apos;re not even covering your tracks .
we heard about you back in mystic falls .
so stefan sent you .
hmm . i thought we were on the off part
of our endless on @-@ again , off @-@ again ,
eternity @-@ of @-@ misery cycle .
lucky for you he cared just enough to send me .
so why &apos;d you flip it ?
what traumatic event was too much for damon salvatore to handle ?
&quot; leave it to beaver . &quot; the fifties bored me .
well , it &apos;s the seventies now ,
and keeping it off is gonna get you caught and killed .
and i &apos;ll take my chances .
i won &apos;t . i promised stefan--
look . you and stefan have a thing . i get it .
he falls off the wagon , you pick him up .
he &apos;s redeemed , you get your florence nightingale jollies , ok ?
well , i &apos;m not him .
i don &apos;t need or want you .
too bad because you got me .
wow . she sounds dreadful .
she had a mother teresa complex .
so let me guess .
after many dark nights with lexi ,
she convinced you to turn your emotions back on ,
and that &apos;s exactly what you plan to do with me . hmm .
you read the last page of a book first , too ?
i &apos;m gonna get a drink , many drinks .
so you really buy all this ?
not one bit .
i know he &apos;s after the cure .
i &apos;m not stupid .
well , let &apos;s not say things we don &apos;t mean .
damon is like a dog with a bone .
stefan , too .
they won &apos;t give up until they find the cure
and then make me take it .
so i guess i &apos;m gonna have to find it first .
you &apos;re playing him .
no . he &apos;s playing me .
i &apos;m just returning the favor .
what are we even looking for ?
well , if shane really was working with silas ,
chances are he was helping him plan his next move .
where , on his evil villain to @-@ do list--
steal blood , perform 3 massacres ,
pick up dry cleaning ?
actually not to nit @-@ pick ,
but we evil villains usually use minions
to pick up our dry cleaning , that sort of thing .
why is he necessary again ?
well , we don &apos;t know what silas can do ,
so if we do have to go head to head with him ,
an original hybrid who can &apos;t die
might come in handy .
besides , stefan and i work well together ,
or at least we did in the twenties .
well , granted my emotions were off .
and that &apos;s why you were more fun
just as damon is probably relishing
in elena &apos;s emotionless company in new york .
my brother knows what he &apos;s doing .
does he ?
don &apos;t underestimate the allure of darkness , stefan .
even the purest hearts are drawn to it .
still , i &apos;m sure it will all be fine .
i think i found something .
&quot; symbolic figures in the dark arts . &quot;
didn &apos;t bonnie talk about expression triangles ?
here .
&quot; in some schools of magic such as expression ,
&quot; human sacrifice can be used as a focus for power .
&quot; it &apos;s rumored that the addition of two supernatural sacrifices
&quot; compounds the mystical energy ,
creating an expression triangle . &quot;
humans--
that was the council fire .
demons--klaus &apos; hybrid failure .
well , i wouldn &apos;t exactly call it a failure .
what &apos;s the third ?
oh , no .
you want me to kill witches ?
we &apos;ve been over this .
it &apos;s temporary . they &apos;ll come back .
what if i &apos;m not strong enough ?
you are strong enough .
look . it won &apos;t be easy .
once they realize how strong you are ,
they &apos;ll channel each other one by one using spirit magic
till they can strip you of expression .
you have to endure them
until al 12 are linked as one .
listen . your dad &apos;s here .
we have to convince him .
hey . how was the session ?
to be honest ,
not that great .
the meditation isn &apos;t really working .
here magic &apos;s too strong .
you told me you could help her .
dad , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s not his fault .
not his fault ? he &apos;s the one who taught you this magic ,
and now he can &apos;t control it .
listen . we have an idea .
i &apos;m done listening to your ideas .
i want you to get out of my house .
dad !
we just call on the spirits .
i want you out of my house !
wait !
what the hell is happening to her ?
this happened to my wife .
expression consumed her .
she had no control .
i need you to call mom .
we need witches ,
a lot of them .
is this allowed ?
what would lexi say ?
lexi thought the only way i would turn my emotions back on
was if i started enjoying my life again .
do not tell me she took you to bon jovi concerts , too .
no . wrong decade .
lexi was not allowed to feed with stefan .
i didn &apos;t have that problem ,
and neither do you .
i &apos;m hungry .
pick .
don &apos;t scream .
your turn .
packrat .
thanks , will .
is it just you ?
this place wasn &apos;t easy to find .
figured you wouldn &apos;t want to draw attention .
it will work .
i &apos;m aja .
you friends with my mom ?
i was .
after she became a vampire ,
we didn &apos;t have a whole lot in common .
so she &apos;s not coming .
this is witch business .
look . i know you &apos;re scared ,
but i &apos;ve dealt with expression before .
i know the hold it can have on you .
it &apos;s not that .
i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m strong .
you won &apos;t be able to do this alone .
oh , honey , who said anything about being alone ?
there &apos;s almost nothing as strong as a full coven ,
so i brought 11 of my closest friends .
won &apos;t be fun ,
but we &apos;re gonna cleanse you .
you ready ?
let &apos;s do this .
leave .
looks like damon gave us the slip .
good . hopefully he &apos;ll find whatever he &apos;s looking for ,
and then i can take it .
and what if you can &apos;t ?
i mean , he is stronger than you .
you know , i could help you .
you want the cure off the table ,
i want to take it .
we could work together .
work together ? don &apos;t you hate me ?
i hated the moral , self @-@ righteous version of you ,
but this one &apos;s not so bad .
maybe it &apos;s your new haircut .
do you remember what it &apos;s like to be human--
weak , fragile ?
why would you want to go back to that ?
because someday , i want a family &apos; of my own .
and that &apos;s exactly why i don &apos;t want your help .
the best part of having no emotions
is that i can think rationally .
i &apos;ll do whatever it takes to get this done .
you &apos;re the opposite , a pile of neuroses and insecurities ,
hopes and dreams .
you &apos;re basically one big emotional variable that i just don &apos;t really need .
you just made me miss the old elena .
there &apos;s been two massacres .
pastor young &apos;s farm is here ,
and the old lockwood cellar ,
where you spitefully slaughtered 12 of your own hybrids ,
is here .
according to the book ,
the expression triangle
is equilateral ,
putting it here .
somebody &apos;s been skipping their geometry classes .
there are actually two places
where the third massacre could be .
well , you didn &apos;t let me finish .
hey . what &apos;s going on ? did you find bonnie ?
no , but i talked to her dad .
i think i found silas .
call out to the sprits , bonnie .
let them in .
phesmatos tribum--aah !
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s hurting .
it hurts ! ohh !
it &apos;s because you &apos;ve rejected the spirits .
the expression &apos;s consumed you .
phesmatos tribum nas ex viras ...
i changed my mind .
purgal animum sous ...
i don &apos;t want to do this anymore !
obscarus !
let me go !
she &apos;s fighting . i need help .
link with me .
lend me your power .
phesmatos repallus tantian ...
maltuscanum anium par vas .
we need more strength !
phesmatos repallus tantian
maltuscanum anium par vas .
so silas is appearing as professor shane .
wouldn &apos;t be my first choice .
well , it would be if you needed to brainwash bonnie
into committing a massacre .
you need me to come home ?
no , we got it .
how &apos;s the cure search going ?
well ... not great .
i mean , it &apos;s no massacre in the making ,
but rebekah trailed us here .
then in addition to my buddy being a brilliant identity thief ,
he &apos;s also a hoarder .
what are you trying to find ?
will had a repeat customer , 5 &apos; 7 &quot; brunette .
said she was a runner .
katherine .
turns out i was helping her run from me .
ironic .
problem is i &apos;m pretty sure
that his filing system goes by birthdate ,
but i can &apos;t for the life of me remember katherine &apos;s .
june 5 , 1473 .
and that , brother , is why you are the better boyfriend .
well , will you look at that ?
it &apos;s all her former addresses ,
including a couple from the last two months .
i mean , they &apos;re mostly p.o. boxes ,
but , hey , it narrows the search .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
so you headed back now ?
yeah . tomorrow morning .
got to keep up the ruse for the terrible twosome outside ,
pretend like i &apos;m having a good time .
and you &apos;re not ?
i &apos;ll tell you tomorrow .
sorry . i needed some quiet .
couldn &apos;t hear stefan over the runaways 2.0 .
let me guess . he &apos;s worried .
jealous mainly .
he &apos;s having acid flashbacks of me and lexi in the seventies in new york .
i &apos;ll tell you about it over a drink . come on .
lexi stuck with me for months ,
partying with me , showing me a good time ,
but late every night , she &apos;d torture me in the worst way possible .
tell me about her .
no .
what did she look like ,
what did she sound like ?
tell me everything you remember about her .
every night .
and that &apos;s my cue .
you have a nice fight .
try not to break anything .
every night .
every night , we get wasted ,
and the second i bottom out ,
you have to bring up katherine .
because you loved her ,
and love is the most powerful emotion .
if i can just get you to remember how you felt about her ...
i don &apos;t want to remember .
i mean , why do you care so much ?
do you remember how we first met ?
it was 1864 .
stefan had just killed you father ,
made you turn into a vampire ,
and he was killing his way through mystic falls .
you hated him .
rightfully so ,
but before you left , you asked me to help him
because no matter what happened ,
he was still your brother ,
and you cared about him .
now you need help , and he cares about you .
we both do .
let me help you .
tell me about katherine .
talking about katherine &apos;s not gonna help me .
why not ?
because she &apos;s not the person i care about .
it flipped .
the switch . why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because i barely felt it at first ,
but every night , it &apos;s gotten stronger .
it worked .
you worked .
you and lexi ?
here on the bar ?
on the bar , on the stage , on the roof .
it was a very long night .
yeeh .
where you going ?
to the roof .
i want to hear the rest of the story .
ok .
excuse you .
i just want to see where we are .
you know , when we split up ,
you did have the option of going with stefan .
yeah ? and leave bonnie &apos;s life your hands ?
fat chance .
do you even know how to read a map ?
yes , and do you know who taught me ?
my friend magellan .
wow ! you had a friend .
was he drawn to your darkness , too ?
actually , i was referring to damon and elena when i said that ,
but clearly it struck a chord with you .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s not true !
there is no allure to darkness .
really ?
so you &apos;ve never felt the attraction
that comes when someone who &apos;s capable of doing terrible things
for some reason cares only about you ?
i did once when i thought he was worth it ,
but it turns out some people can &apos;t be fixed .
people who do terrible things
are just terrible people .
we &apos;re here ,
although judging by the lack of witches ,
here is not the correct location .
yield to the spirits , bonnie !
you can &apos;t fight us !
stop it . it &apos;s not what you think .
this is no place for a vampire .
she &apos;s working for silas .
silas ?
he brainwashed her to kill you .
wait . what are you doing ?
if silas has her , she &apos;s lost .
we can &apos;t save her .
wait .
i have the power of 12 witches .
you don &apos;t stand a chance !
they &apos;re linked . bonnie &apos;s gonna kill them .
not if the witches kill her first .
klaus , we need to save her .
how ? the only way to stop the witches is to kill them ,
and then silas gets what he wants .
spirits , take her soul .
free her from darkness .
no !
bonnie .
bonnie !
the triangle is complete .
it &apos;s beautiful up here .
i could do this , you know ?
the lexi method .
hang with you , party with you .
it wouldn &apos;t be the worst way to turn my emotions back on .
i thought you hated emotions .
i do .
maybe i &apos;m just looking for an excuse to ...
spend more time with you .
i &apos;ve never done it on a rooftop before .
you &apos;re not missing much .
you don &apos;t have to take the high road , damon .
i &apos;m not sired to you anymore .
i want this . you want this .
what ?
looking for that ?
you really think that was gonna work ,
the sex , the temptation , the booze ?
what , are you kidding me ?
i invented that trick .
good luck !
spent all night reinforcing it .
it was tough .
had to be really quiet not to wake you up .
what is this ?
payment .
for what ?
for the last 6 months of my life ,
for the nagging ,
for the self @-@ righteous platitudes .
i &apos;m paying you back for 6 months of you .
your humanity isn &apos;t back on , is it ?
never was .
so this was all just--
a joke !
it was a big , fat lie .
best part of it is , you believed it .
you thought i was a like stefan ,
a wounded little bird that you could nurse back to health ,
but he &apos;s a victim .
i choose to be this way .
enjoy the day .
i hear it &apos;s gonna be a scorcher .
so you pretended to have feelings for her
just to get her off your back ?
i was willing to do whatever it took .
sound familiar ?
aw . i hurt your feelings .
not my feelings . i &apos;m looking out for you .
because one day , you will flip that switch back on ,
and all the bad stuff that you did
is gonna come rushing back ,
and it is going to suck .
so you &apos;re saying that you felt bad for lexi ?
she became a walking , talking reminder
of all the awful things i &apos;d done .
i managed to avoid her for decades ,
and then she just shows up in mystic falls
to wish my baby bro happy birthday , and boom--
rush of memories , rush of guilt .
so you killed her ?
out of sight , out of mind .
every day that you &apos;re like this
is the day that you might do the one thing that you can &apos;t take back .
here &apos;s what i don &apos;t get .
you spent 6 months trying to get her to fall in love with you
just so that you could hurt her .
you were spiteful , malicious , borderline evil ,
and you say that you had your emotions turned off ,
but those all sound like emotions to me .
maybe they were .
maybe hatred was the first one i got back .
all the more reason to cure you .
that way , we get the normal elena back
without all the ugly stages in between .
i &apos;m not taking the cure , damon .
yes , you are , even if i have to break your neck
or tie you up in chains until we find it .
what was that you said about handling things yourself ?
how you feeling ?
what are you doing here ?
how &apos;d i get here ?
what do you mean ? i--i brought you home .
the witches almost killed you .
what witches ?
you don &apos;t remember ?
whatever the witches did must have messed with your memory .
how did i get off the island ?
wait . bonnie ...
what &apos;s the last thing you can remember ?
i guess i remember being in that cave ,
and
jeremy was trying to pry the cure out of silas &apos; hands .
please tell me he got it .
we didn &apos;t get it , did we ?
bonnie , there &apos;s something you need to know about jeremy .
there . 12 graves for 12 witches .
like it never happened .
only it did happen ,
and now silas has everything he needs
to open the gates to hell on earth .
you were just gonna let bonnie die .
i know arithmetic isn &apos;t your strong point ,
but one is still less than 12 .
yeah , but that one is my best friend .
you tell yourself whatever you need to
so you can sleep at night .
i just killed 12 people .
you look like you &apos;re in need of comfort .
why don &apos;t you find someone less terrible you can relate to ?
thank you .
of the 3 massacres , this is the one i was dreading .
silas i presume .
morning , damon .
where are you ?
the better question would be where are we going ?
sorry , damon . i think i broke your radio .
you &apos;re in my car ? !
heh . we weren &apos;t gonna take the bus .
i wish this could have gone differently .
i really do ,
but we &apos;ll give katherine your best .
damon , what did you do ?
let &apos;s just say it involves a 5 &apos; 7 &quot; brunette
and her blond accomplice .
please don &apos;t tell me this is going where i think it is .
wrong fantasy , brother ,
unless you &apos;re into betrayal and snapped necks .
the lead i had on katherine elena stole .
if you &apos;re searching for
the words to tell me how badly i screwed up ,
save your breath .
i didn &apos;t stop the massacre .
guess silas has everything he needs .
everything but the cure .
i &apos;m sorry , mate .
don &apos;t have it .
but you know who does ,
and the last thing that you want
is for that cure to be used on you ,
so you bring it to me ,
and it won &apos;t be .
you get to live .
