how long has it been since you had a drop of human blood ?
since the night i threatened to drive elena
off the wickery bridge .
you &apos;re not gonna survive this cold @-@ turkey thing .
you never do .
go on . have a bite .
what are you two doing ? stefan ?
elena ...
this was a murder .
someone drove this stake through his heart .
i would know if i were killing people .
have you had any blackouts ? instances of lost time ?
you wear a ring that lets you cheat death , ric .
how many times can you die before it changes you ?
what are you looking for ?
i don &apos;t know .
a tumor , vascular anomalies .
anything physical that might explain his behavior .
if it &apos;s medical , i can treat it .
and if it &apos;s not ?
well ...
then we &apos;ll deal with that , too .
when did you suspect him ?
that it was alaric who was killing all of those people ?
it was after he told me about his ring .
i remembered a story my grandmother had told me
about samantha gilbert and her secret journal .
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but we fells
are notorious busybodies .
then why did you protect him ?
because i &apos;m a doctor .
i don &apos;t like to see someone hurt
by something they have no control over .
and , because when he and i first met ,
i felt like , i don &apos;t know , i ...
i just kind of want to help him .
everything all right in there ?
yeah .
yeah , everything &apos;s ok .
meredith says that everything is normal .
well , everything is normal .
because there is nothing wrong with me .
i didn &apos;t kill brian walters , i didn &apos;t kill bill forbes ,
and i sure as hell didn &apos;t shove a hunting knife into my stomach .
or i did , and i &apos;ve gone insane ,
just like your ancestor , who ...
wore that ring .
look , i &apos;m going to call bonnie .
the rings were made by a bennett witch .
maybe a witch can reverse the damage .
take it .
i don &apos;t want it anymore .
ready to ditch this house of horrors ?
oof . you look terrible .
yeah . let me--let me check out of here .
don &apos;t worry about him . we &apos;ll take him out for chicken soup ,
we &apos;ll get him a martini , make sure he doesn &apos;t kill anybody .
what is wrong with you ?
how could you just go out feeding with stefan
like some vampire pub crawl ?
oh , right . i thought we were talking about alaric ,
but of course we &apos;re talking about stefan .
you stood there and let him feed on an innocent girl !
i didn &apos;t let him do anything .
if you want to get nit @-@ picky about it ,
i made him .
why would you do that ?
because we &apos;re vampires , elena .
we need human blood to survive .
we &apos;re predators , not puppies .
well , stefan found a way around it before .
stefan has built himself a delusional wagon
which he has repeatedly fallen off of .
what he needs to learn is control .
he was able to manage it when he was drinking my blood .
small amounts every singly day .
ah , yes .
back when you two were in love
and it was all rainbows and unicorns .
i &apos;m just saying . maybe you &apos;re not the right person
to be teaching stefan about self control .
i totally lucked out . the hospital just had a blood drive ,
so , i got some ...
o negatives , some as ,
and , my personal favorite , b positive .
yeah . i made her a daylight ring .
she &apos;s just been standing out there all morning .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s taking this very well .
well , it &apos;s only been a few days since she turned .
your mom &apos;s still adjusting .
miss wilson ?
why don &apos;t you come inside ?
you know , have something to drink .
i can &apos;t feel it anymore .
my garden .
it &apos;s gone .
i can &apos;t feel anything .
i don &apos;t understand .
witches have a connection to the earth .
we can literally feel nature .
life .
when abby became a vampire ,
she lost it .
i don &apos;t know how to help her .
rebekah &apos;s up to something .
she &apos;s been snooping around in places she shouldn &apos;t be .
tell me again , why are we here ?
ric , the world can &apos;t stop
just because you &apos;re an accidental psycho killer .
do you have any tact whatsoever ?
alaric !
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . did you bring the sign ?
the restored wickery bridge sign .
the history department promised me you would have it today .
no , i don &apos;t have the sign , actually .
it slipped-- slipped my mind .
i &apos;ve been ... busy .
well , it &apos;s not an emergency .
we &apos;ll just , um , unveil it when the bridge is complete .
get me out of here .
my pleasure .
i &apos;m going to stick around for a bit .
who is that ?
blast from the past .
... construction has begun replacing the original
wooden support structure to meet modern safety standards .
and , our beautification phase will begin in the spring .
so give yourselves a hand .
damon salvatore . my favorite student .
sage , my hottest teacher . what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m just passing through .
oh , come on .
no one just passes through mystic falls .
look what the cat dragged in .
easy there , rebekah .
you know , she used to beat men for sport .
she always was quite common .
rebekah .
what a happy surprise .
what are you doing here , sage ?
well , i heard finn was finally freed from that casket
your rageaholic brother klaus carted him around in .
oh , finn . you just missed him .
he left town and didn &apos;t tell a soul where he was going .
oh . he probably went looking for me .
or , quite possibly , he forgot all about you .
i doubt that .
no ?
because he didn &apos;t seem to mention you .
sorry you came all this way for nothing .
have a nice life .
god , i had that ugly elitist original bitch .
i &apos;m sorry .
damon told alaric that there was no one home .
otherwise , i would have ...
i just got home .
i just came by to pick up this book that you found
on my ancestor samantha .
that &apos;s fine .
uh , how are you doing ?
damon said that you were--
yeah , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m ok .
did you get everything you need ?
yeah .
well , if there &apos;s anything i can do to help ...
you don &apos;t have to read that , you know .
i can just tell you what happened .
samantha gilbert was committed to an insane asylum .
she tried to give herself a lobotomy with a knitting needle .
and bled to death on the floor of her cell .
if the same thing is happening to alaric ,
then there &apos;s ...
nothing you can do .
ok , well--
i &apos;m going to let you get back to , uh ,
whatever it was you were doing .
finn ? really ?
he &apos;s my one true love .
he turned me so we could be together forever .
then klaus daggered him and locked him away
and i &apos;ve been waiting ever since .
please don &apos;t tell me that you and rebekah are friends .
ah , not unless you count the hate sex .
good .
&apos;cause her and klaus always treated me like some peasant whore .
ah , she &apos;s just lurking around because she wants something from me .
i can &apos;t figure out what it is , though .
why don &apos;t you get inside her head and find it ?
because it &apos;s impossible . she &apos;s too strong .
i bet i can get in there .
sage , she &apos;s an original .
it &apos;s not going to happen .
have you forgotten everything i taught you ?
rebekah may be an original , but she &apos;s a girl .
you find her weakness and exploit it ,
and i &apos;ll walk right in .
that is , if you want my help .
anyone ever tell you you &apos;re sexy when you &apos;re bitchy ?
we &apos;re talking now , are we ?
because you were quite rude the other day .
using me to help you with stefan ,
and then shooing me away like a stray dog .
ah , that was brother business . you can &apos;t hold that against me .
besides , i really did appreciate your help .
even if i didn &apos;t show it .
you were mean .
you like mean .
no . i don &apos;t .
no ?
you didn &apos;t get a thrill back there pushing sage down ,
crushing her dreams of true love ?
maybe a little .
see ?
mean .
can sage and i interest you in a drink back at the house ?
not a chance in hell .
you know what they say .
two &apos;s company . three is a party .
ok .
enjoy the rest of your day .
haven &apos;t seen you up at the house .
abby &apos;s been asking for you .
i &apos;ve been pretty busy .
hey , hey ! stay away from me !
easy !
i was just going to help you carry the firewood up !
you &apos;re scared of her .
she &apos;s a vampire .
she needs to feel connected to the people she loves .
she needs to feel normal right now--
she &apos;s not normal . none of this is normal .
well , abby didn &apos;t choose this . this was forced on her .
she could have let herself die but she didn &apos;t .
she &apos;s trying to make this work so she can be there for you ,
and for bonnie , so--
so just get over yourself !
ok ?
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
bonnie &apos;s not returning any of my calls .
sorry . she &apos;s still mad .
and , seriously ,
abby &apos;s transition has been a little rough ,
so she &apos;s got a lot on her mind .
i know . and i get it . but ...
something really terrible is happening to ric ,
and i really need her help .
i really don &apos;t think you should be looking through that stuff .
ah , it &apos;s the truth .
restraining orders and all .
my life in a series of police reports .
you don &apos;t strike me as an angry guy .
which sounds weird , given everything .
but ... you don &apos;t .
yeah , well , i was stupid when i was younger .
but listen , it &apos;s not like these guys didn &apos;t have it coming .
i mean ... this guy here
broke a beer bottle over a bartender &apos;s head .
and this guy ... hit his girlfriend .
and this guy ...
ok , this guy was just a douche .
everyone needs to find a way to deal with their dark side .
some people meditate .
i became a vampire hunter .
mmm , semi @-@ retired .
listen , there &apos;s something
that &apos;s not in these reports that i need to tell you about .
ok ...
ominous . shoot .
your cousin logan fell ,
the one who was vampire slayed ...
i did the slaying .
the vampire thing ...
it &apos;s not my fight .
i use their blood for what i need
and leave the judgment to everyone else .
although , i have kind of been wondering
why you never drew a stake through damon &apos;s heart .
i tried once .
he killed me .
yeah .
yeah , figures .
the thing that started all this ring stuff was me being angry enough
to think i could take on a vampire in the first place .
oh , come on . slow down , brother .
control , remember ?
doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s blondes or blood bags ,
same principles apply .
what did you say to elena this morning ?
oh , you &apos;re stress eating . sublimating .
you need to observe each other while you &apos;re pining and moping .
i asked you a question , damon .
i told her what she already knows--
you &apos;re a vampire and you drink human blood .
and to get over it .
which is the same thing i &apos;m telling you .
own it , live it , love it .
stop being ashamed of who you are .
do me a favor , damon--
next time you talk to elena ,
keep me out of it , ok ?
gladly .
now , unless you &apos;re interested in a sage @-@ rebekah sex sandwich ,
i suggest you make yourself ... scarce .
who are you , again ?
the guy who lives out back .
you know , the one you &apos;re not related to .
right .
caroline and i had a little talk .
sounds like code for caroline lectured you .
maybe . but i needed it .
abby &apos;s always been there for me .
now it &apos;s my turn .
thought i could build a fire .
please .
maybe it &apos;ll distract everyone from my crappy cooking .
jamie ...
i &apos;m so sorry , abby .
i &apos;m sorry about everything .
no !
abby !
remember this song ?
all right , miss master seductress ,
where &apos;s our victim ?
patience .
between her craving for affection
and her pathological fear of being left alone ,
our little get together is too tempting to resist .
finn &apos;s gone , you know .
i choose to believe otherwise .
he strung you along for 900 years ,
didn &apos;t bother to call . he &apos;s gone .
you know , the damon i knew was holding out for someone , too .
yes , he was . hope &apos;s a bitch , sage .
get out while you can .
the sweet chime of desperation .
i stole it from nik who stole it from a queen .
i &apos;m not sure which one .
well , this is depressing .
what happened to the party ?
it just arrived .
how about a duet .
what about her ?
i want her .
and i want you .
you have to drink these . it &apos;ll help .
i almost killed him !
caroline said that this kind of thing
happens a lot at first , when you &apos;re still--
no , no . i should just go right now ,
before i hurt jamie again , or you !
the only way you &apos;re going to hurt me is if you leave .
don &apos;t give up on this . not again .
we can make this work .
he &apos;s fine .
nothing a little vampire blood can &apos;t cure .
thank you .
now i need a favor .
listen , i want you to have this .
this is a list of my bank accounts , passwords ,
where to find my will and how to contact my family
just in case this doesn &apos;t go my way .
no , no , don &apos;t even think like that .
elena , i need to know that you and jeremy are going to be ok .
we &apos;re all going to be fine .
caroline ?
so abby thinks bonnie can reverse the damage with a spell .
i guess the same thing happens with witches
who become obsessed with dark magic .
they lose control and start acting out their darkest impulses .
thank you so much .
i &apos;m going to hang back here with abby ,
but bonnie &apos;s leaving now , so if--
um , hold on .
i need a personal effect of alaric &apos;s .
something he wore before he started wearing the ring .
ok . i &apos;ll get it .
um ... bonnie , i &apos;m so sorry for everything .
thank you for doing this .
be ready to do the spell as soon as i get there .
we have to work fast .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
good news , bad news ?
bonnie thinks that she can help you with a spell .
well , it &apos;s worth a try .
but she needs something
that you wore before you put on the ring .
something personal .
well , there &apos;s , uh ...
my wedding ring .
it &apos;s at the loft .
ok , yeah .
um , that &apos;s a good idea .
i think it &apos;s better if you stay here with me .
oh , you and your tranquilizers .
it &apos;s in the dresser by the kitchen .
it &apos;s in , uh , an aspirin bottle .
probably covered in cobwebs .
ok .
i take it back .
your plan is amazing .
i told you ,
if you got her comfortable enough ...
she &apos;s an open book .
well , are you going to torture me
or are you going to tell me what she &apos;s up to ?
i &apos;d rather show you .
the white oak tree .
it must have been the only tree to replace the old .
it probably got cut down .
do you happen to know who kept the milling ledgers
during that period ?
there &apos;s another tree .
milling records ?
our family made one of its many fortunes selling lumber .
that &apos;s why rebekah &apos;s been digging around about this stuff .
that tree was on our land and milled by our yard .
the letters will tell me where it was shipped .
the business archives should be around here somewhere .
get upstairs . make sure you keep her distracted .
you &apos;ve got to be kidding me .
missed you at the house .
alaric told me you &apos;d be here .
you made yourself perfectly clear this morning , stefan .
you don &apos;t want to be around me .
i &apos;m not trying to hurt you , elena .
i just can &apos;t be who you want be to be right now .
i &apos;m not in control .
so then what are you doing here ?
well , i , uh , did a little more digging
on samantha gilbert .
founding families were always pretty good
about destroying their records ,
but i found a couple of newspaper articles .
seems she killed two people while she was in the institution .
a nurse and a guard .
so she was a psychopath . i get it .
she was under suicide watch .
no personal effects . no jewelry .
wait , so you &apos;re saying
that the violent behavior can still happen
even if the person isn &apos;t wearing the ring ?
still with me ?
yeah .
yeah , i &apos;m still with you .
i &apos;m half @-@ dead , too .
neither one of us has slept in two days .
don &apos;t worry-- i &apos;ve got coffee on .
rebekah just left .
happy , i hope .
did you find what you were looking for ?
yep . in 1912 , the salvatore milling company
chopped down a forest .
its most valuable wood came from an old white oak tree
that was used to make the wickery bridge .
these aren &apos;t public records ,
so rebekah &apos;s going to chase her tail for a long time .
so all the wood stripped from the underside of that bridge
is basically a weapon that could kill an original .
yep .
you see how this could be a problem for me , right ?
why ?
because of your true love finn ?
let me tell you something-- i &apos;ve met the guy .
you &apos;re not going to miss him .
i will rip your head off
in two seconds if you take one more step .
all right , let &apos;s make a deal .
you want me to kill rebekah ,
i consider finn untouchable ,
you guys walk into the sunset together .
is that a promise ?
yes .
it &apos;s a promise .
if bonnie &apos;s spell doesn &apos;t work ,
what are you going to do with him ?
i &apos;m not going to do anything , stefan .
i &apos;m going to keep looking
until we can find something that will help him .
you don &apos;t know how long this has been going on .
it might be too late .
it &apos;s my family &apos;s ring that &apos;s doing this to him .
it &apos;s my responsibility to fix it .
you can &apos;t put that on yourself .
not everyone is your responsibility .
not everyone can be saved .
are we talking about alaric here ?
or are we talking about you ?
because i wasn &apos;t planning on giving up on either of you .
what is that ?
pictures of his victims .
sage , let &apos;s go .
we have originals to kill .
sage ...
&quot; jeremy , if anything happens to me ,
carry on my work .
you have the other ring , let the ring make you strong .
the council must be cleansed before the work can begin . &quot;
it &apos;s the founders &apos; council roster .
looks like some sort of hit list .
no , alaric didn &apos;t write this .
who else would have written it , elena ?
i have to get back .
looking for something ?
i don &apos;t know where anything is in this house .
i &apos;m sorry , i can &apos;t remember , do you take cream ?
no cream .
i was going to make sandwiches .
i am starving .
can i ask you a question ?
no mustard .
i hate mustard .
do you ever feel remorse ?
sorry ?
well ...
you are a council member .
and the council was formed
to protect the people of this town from vampires , yet
here you all are ,
just looking the other way ,
ignoring your responsibilities .
like you , and your vampire blood .
so i &apos;m asking you .
do you ever feel remorse ?
because you should .
your grand plans always seem to get ruined , don &apos;t they ?
sorry to disappoint you .
again .
you set me up .
no .
i &apos;m just looking out for myself .
i told you i &apos;d save your creepy boyfriend !
and you lied to me , damon !
the originals are linked .
if one dies , they all die .
if i can get inside her head ,
don &apos;t think i &apos;d be able to get inside yours ?
i should eat you .
i &apos;m 900 years old , damon .
you &apos;re not capable of ending me .
do you really think that i would risk finn &apos;s life
for one of your petty revenge fantasies ?
let me tell you something--
your long lost love has a suicide wish .
so when mama witch linked them together in a spell ,
he &apos;s the one who volunteered to die .
he wouldn &apos;t do that .
he didn &apos;t want to live .
not for you , not for anyone .
he doesn &apos;t love you , sage .
and when i do find another way to kill those originals ,
i &apos;ll start with finn .
hey , there .
hi . where &apos;s meredith ?
oh , she got called in to the hospital
for a last minute surgery , but she &apos;ll be back later .
what happened ?
oh , i ...
broke a coffee cup and sliced my hand open
trying to pick up the pieces .
but i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll live .
did stefan catch up with you ?
no .
did you get my ring ?
i--i couldn &apos;t find it .
yeah , well , my place is a bit of a disaster .
i guess i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll just have to go get it .
no , don &apos;t hurt him !
i &apos;ll try not to .
elena , i need you to come upstairs with me .
why ?
i &apos;m going to need your help .
meredith !
ok , ok .
you &apos;re going to be ok .
what the hell are you doing here ?
just making sure the witch didn &apos;t turn you into a toad
or a block of salt .
bonnie did a little spell .
it &apos;s nothing to worry about .
just something to keep the killer in you at bay .
did something happen ?
let &apos;s just say you &apos;ve got an alter ego
hell bent on killing council members .
so we &apos;re going to pack up some of your stuff ,
we &apos;re going to go to the loft , just for a little bit .
you know , it &apos;s like house arrest , light .
wait , where &apos;s meredith ?
she &apos;ll be fine , ric .
hey .
you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
abby says that all the dying and coming back to life
might have chipped away at alaric &apos;s psyche ,
making it easier for the darkness to take hold .
these herbs are the binding element of the spell .
he needs to take them twice a day .
i &apos;ll get you more .
abby and i are going to work on the garden .
how is she doing ?
the transition &apos;s been hard ,
but i think she &apos;ll be ok .
eventually ,
i &apos;m going to go back and stay with her for a while .
it &apos;ll give us a chance to work things through .
i &apos;m sorry , bonnie . i didn &apos;t--
i didn &apos;t want this to happen .
if there &apos;s anything that i can do to make it different , i ...
i know .
please say that you forgive me .
of course i do .
am i even doing this right ?
yeah , you &apos;re doing fine .
ok .
hey , um , thanks for helping out with abby .
bonnie &apos;s really lucky to have a friend like you .
well ...
i went through the same thing once .
with my dad .
but it didn &apos;t really work out .
so ...
you know .
well , when bonnie gets back ,
she can snap her fingers or wave her hands or whatever ,
and make the herbs bloom .
i think abby &apos;s up .
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re leaving .
you kidding me ?
i have to .
i don &apos;t know how to do this .
do what ?
be a vampire or a parent ?
because i can help you be a vampire .
i can teach you self control .
but being a parent , i mean , that &apos;s all you .
bonnie grew up without a mom ,
because you ran away once .
but now you have an eternity to make up for it
and you &apos;re just going to throw that away ?
she &apos;s better off without me !
no , she &apos;s not ! no one is better off without their parents .
she wants to make this work .
please .
just stay .
tell them i &apos;m sorry .
hello ?
hey , stranger .
hey , you checking up on me ?
do you need checking up on ?
well , i &apos;m not flunking any of my classes . yet .
and i got a dog .
hey , have you talked to alaric lately ?
uh , no , why ?
is everything ok ?
yeah , everything is fine .
um , i just wanted to hear your voice .
ok .
hey , can i call you later ?
i &apos;m actually on my way out with some friends .
yeah , um , of course , jer .
go out . go have fun and , um ...
i-- i just miss you .
yeah . yeah , i miss you , too .
little early in the day for you , isn &apos;t it ?
just having a little toast .
to what ?
control .
you &apos;re happy , i &apos;m happy .
why are you in such a good mood ?
sage double crossed you , tree &apos;s a pile of ash ,
alaric &apos;s got a psychopathic alter ego .
you know , stefan ,
i &apos;m a philanthropist .
i make the world a better place .
restoring bridges , landmarks , and ...
historical signs made of the same white oak
as the wickery bridge .
they think all the wood burned .
i sold my rage . you should have seen me .
we have a weapon .
game &apos;s back on , brother .
