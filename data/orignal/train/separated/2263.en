Gold--he says there's a way to stop cora.
It's the ink. There's a jar of it in his cell,
where we kept him.
What happened?
David--he went under a sleeping spell. Now he's trapped.
We destroyed the wardrobe.
Cora gathered the ashes.
She's gonna use them to open up a portal.
There's an enchanted compass. Cora seeks it.
The compass is in your hand. Why do this to me now?
You took a heart.
And now you have a princess.
Cora didn't see me escape.
How did you escape?
Hook--he said that if you had trusted him...
You could've defeated cora together.
Can we get on with the business of going to Storybrooke?
All we need is the compass.
Halt.
Food for the prisoner.
It's not mealtime. Who are you?
Identify yourself, slave.
"Slave"?
I prefer "Captain."
Hi. You must be Belle.
The queen sent you, didn't she?
She wants you to kill me.
I'm not here to kill you, love.
I'm here to rescue you.
Rescue me? Who are you?
A friend.
We haven't much time.
Your father's life is in danger.
He's being attacked by the very same monster
who stole you away from your family in the first place.
What, Rumplestiltskin?
The dark one-- he must be stopped.
You spent more time with him than anyone.
There are rumors of a magical weapon
that has the power to kill him.
No. No. No. No. Let--let me talk to him.
He's not a monster.
Belle, your father's life hangs in the balance.
I need to know what that weapon is and where to find it.
I don't know what you're talking about,
and I have no idea how to-- how to kill Rumplestiltskin.
You don't?
No. And--and nor would I.
Then I'm afraid I'm not here to rescue you.
So pretty...
Yet so useless.
No. Not useless.
She's a valuable chess piece.
Do I look like I'm playing a game of chess?
My Hook, if you please.
No.
The asking was me being a gentleman.
Is that any way to address a queen?
Even a pirate should have better manners than that.
Yes.
I know who you are...
Captain.
I know why you came here from Neverland,
and I know all about the crocodile you wish to skin.
Then you also know that I'll stop at nothing.
So dedicated and resourceful.
No one has been able to fight their way
past my defenses before.
She can't help you kill Rumplestiltskin, Hook...
But I can,
if you do something for me.
Care to join me for a drink?
Things are about to change in this world.
Radically.
I have plans to enact a curse
that will take everyone to a far-off land.
How will that help me?
This new realm?
It's a land without magic,
where the dark one will be stripped of his powers.
There you won't need any magical weapon to kill him.
You can do it
with a mere flick of your wrist.
Tell me what I have to do.
There's one person I don't want following me to this new land.
You're to see to it that doesn't happen.
An assassination.
Who is it you want me to dispose of?
My mother.
Any change?
No.
He's not improving.
He needs true love's kiss.
He won't wake up until Mary Margaret comes back.
Until?
Well, that's rather optimistic, isn't it?
What are you talking about?
They're up against your mother.
The only chance Snow and Emma have of defeating her
is with the squid ink.
Which is why you sent the message through David.
Which would be beneficial
if we knew that message were delivered.
But alas, given the prince's condition, we don't know.
As such, it's important we take precautions.
We have to consider the possibility
that when that portal opens,
it won't be his family that come through.
It'll be Cora.
And neither one of us wants that.
We have to find where they're coming through
and destroy that portal.
But whoever came through would die.
Exactly. But I'm confident between the two of us,
we can summon up enough magic to complete the task.
Well, what if we're wrong?
What if that portal opens up, and it's not my mother?
What if Mary Margaret and Emma do defeat cora
and go through it?
Well, I believe in this world, they call that a win-win.
How exactly is that?
If we stop Cora,
you are protected from your mother's wrath.
If, on the other hand, we stop Snow and Emma,
well...
You become the only mother in your son's life,
now don't you?
Look, magic is unpredictable in this world.
If something unfortunate were to happen
while you were attempting to help...
Henry could hardly blame you for that, could he?
No.
I can't lie to him.
I am trying to be a better mother.
You won't be able to be a better anything
if Cora comes through.
And if she does,
she will be a threat to everyone,
including your son.
So if you truly want to be a good mother to Henry,
to protect him.
If you want to be better,
prove it.
Rumplestiltskin's cell.
I haven't been here since before Regina's curse.
This is where he told us you were going to be the savior.
He knew?
Oh, it was prophesized.
Come on.
The squid ink-- it's not here.
Gold said we would find it.
Well, was there anyone else in here with him?
Could they have taken the ink?
No, he was kept alone.
Visitors were forbidden. He was too dangerous
to allow any human contact.
How'd he keep from going crazy?
He didn't.
What is it?
Is that a message?
Yes.
And I think it's for you.
Why would you think...
That?
"With one kiss,
true love's power made everything right again.
But this was not the end of their story.
It was just the beginning."
I think this time it'll happen the other way around.
You think so?
I do.
Which is why I need you to stay here
and watch David for a little while.
Where are you going?
Mr. Gold and I need to prepare
for Emma and Mary Margaret's return.
Coming through the portal won't be easy.
We need to make sure everything's in place.
Really? You're really gonna help them?
I promised you I was going to do better,
to be better.
So yes.
I'm going to do everything in my power
to see to it they come home safely.
You really have changed.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I'm really glad you, uh,
came to your senses.
Let's just get this over with.
It's right through here.
Ah, yes.
Should suit our purposes, no?
How much do we need?
All of it.
How are we going to do that?
With a little help from a fairy.
Dead one.
Believe me,
no one mourns her.
It's now...
enchanted.
It will enable you to rip out her heart.
I believe you've seen it done before.
Yes.
The enchantment will only allow you to rip out one heart,
so make sure you do it right.
What could she have possibly done to warrant such brutality?
That's my business.
Yours is to kill her and bring her body back to me.
Easy enough.
When will I set forth on this murderous journey?
Immediately.
But you won't be going alone.
You remember Claude.
Can't say that I do.
You killed him in the cell block.
Ah, yes.
I didn't recognize him without my hook in his neck.
Forgive me, but isn't he a bit of dead weight?
I banished my mother
to a far-off land some time ago.
You're gonna need a portal to get to her.
The rules are simple.
One goes in, one comes back.
Or in this case, two in, two back.
You'll arrive with Claude,
and you'll return with my mother.
Now tell me...
which far-off land do I have the pleasure of visiting today?
Wonderland.
Happily named, I'm sure.
How will I find her?
Oh, don't worry. She'll find you.
Kneel... Before the Queen of Hearts.
Appreciate the warm welcome.
Why has he come to Wonderland?
The queen wants to know why you've come to Wonderland.
I'm in search of someone.
In her native land, she goes by "Cora."
In this land, she goes by "Your majesty."
Leave us.
Your name, pirate?
Hook.
What a clever nickname.
I come bearing gifts, if you allow me.
This hat,
your portal...
if I understand correctly,
the same number who travels through must also return.
You arrived with him,
but who shall you return with?
You.
What?
I'm the Queen of Hearts.
Do you really think I'd be so careless
as to keep my heart where everyone else does?
This...
is how it's done.
Tell me, who did this?
Who sent you here to kill me?
Who?
Your daughter.
Regina?
She...
wants me dead?
You're now going to tell me everything
and do exactly what I want.
Because when you hold a heart,
you control it.
You have the power.
What does this even mean?
He was obsessed with you, Emma.
You were the key to breaking the curse.
We've looked everywhere. There's no ink in this cell.
Well, it has to be. He told David.
You were in a netherworld.
Maybe something got lost in translation.
No.
She heard right.
You found it?
In a manner of speaking,
there was ink in the cell.
Son of a bitch.
Aurora, what are you doing?!
No.
Helping me.
No.
No.
Don't waste your energy, dear.
Rumplestiltskin himself couldn't escape from this cell.
Thank you, Aurora. We couldn't have done it without you.
Why would you do this?
How could you?
Don't blame her.
She was only doing what she was told.
You took her heart?
Actually, I did.
It was a gift.
Forgive us. We'd love to stay,
but Storybrooke awaits.
Hook.
Wait.
Please don't do this.
My son is in Storybrooke. He needs me.
Perhaps you should've considered that
before you abandoned me on that beanstalk.
You would've done the same.
Actually, no.
Do you know what this is, Emma?
The bean that the giant kept.
Yes, indeed.
A pirate always keeps a souvenir of his conquest,
but this...
Well, this is much more than a mere trinket.
This is a symbol--
something that was once magical, full of hope,
possibility.
Now look at it.
Dried up, dead, useless.
Much like you.
The time for making deals is done,
just as I'm done...
with you.
Leroy! What is it? What's the emergency?
Leroy.
They're gone.
They're all gone.
"And yes, she was beyond hope,
beyond saving.
This was her end."
Where are they-- Regina and Gold?
What's going on?
All the magic has been drained from the mines.
They stole it?
They snuck in after our shift
and took everything.
Nobody steals from a dwarf.
Except the queen.
And Rumplestiltskin.
If they're not helping Emma and Mary Margaret, that...
that means my mom lied to me.
I'm sorry, Henry.
We need to find her. We need to stop them.
We need to help Emma and Mary Margaret.
We aren't going to break it down, Emma.
It was enchanted to hold Rumplestiltskin.
We don't have a chance.
This is my fault.
No, it's mine.
Cora stole your heart because I failed to protect you.
That's very sweet,
but I believe it's my fault.
I'm the savior
and I'm not doing much saving, am I?
We're going to win this fight, you know.
Good always defeats evil.
You sound like Henry.
Guess optimism runs in the family.
I think it skipped a generation.
You should know better than anybody.
You broke the curse.
What have I done since then?
I got us stranded over here, burned down the wardrobe,
let Cora get the ash and now the compass.
The only reason I ever broke the curse
was because it was exactly what Gold wanted me to do.
I had nothing to do with it.
What are you talking about?
He told you I was the savior. It was his plan.
Once I fulfilled that role,
maybe that's all I was ever meant to do.
Everything I've ever done--
he had it all mapped out before I was even born.
I'm not powerful. I'm--I'm not...
a savior.
I'm a name on a piece of paper.
I'm a pawn, and that's exactly why we are in here...
and Cora's on her way to Storybrooke.
Where are we going?
Lake Nostos.
The legend says its waters hold the power
to restore what was once lost.
It'll return magic to what remains of this wardrobe.
And then...
we'll be able to cross worlds.
I may be a simple pirate, but I know one thing.
Lakes have water.
After everything we've been through,
why do you still doubt me?
I've told you all I know.
Now have some honor and kill me.
Honor?
For the pirate who snuck into my palace
to assassinate me?
At your daughter's behest.
She should've come.
She should've killed me herself.
Mercy seems a bit out of character.
Oh, not mercy, Hook.
You're going to help me.
Regina knows my methods better than anyone.
If I was controlling you, she'd know.
This has to be your choice.
Why should I?
Because, my dear, I'm the only one
who can give you what you want.
Is that so?
This curse my daughter plans to enact,
this new land she's taking everyone to--
you won't remember who you are.
So tell me, Captain,
how do you expect to kill someone
when you can't even remember him?
But if you do what I say,
I'll make sure you not only kill him,
but that you remember every single moment.
Well, what shall you have me do?
Get me close to my daughter,
and then I'll rip her heart out.
Satisfied?
Did she put up a fight?
Nothing I couldn't handle.
Thank you.
Now leave us.
I'd like a moment alone to say good-bye.
I'm sorry, mother.
Without you, I never would've become the person I am now.
But I had no choice.
I had to do this.
After you killed Daniel,
you told me something I've never forgotten.
Love is weakness.
Well, mother, you are my weakness
because I love you.
That's why I couldn't risk
taking you to the new land with me.
Your grip on my heart is just too strong.
And for what I need to do...
I can't have any weakness.
Good-bye, mother.
What happened? You didn't kill her.
There's been a change in plans.
What would that be?
My daughter's curse is coming.
We have to protect ourselves.
Wouldn't it have been easier to reconcile with her
before her curse destroys the land?
Regina doesn't need me--
not now,
not when she thinks she's about to win.
But I still have a place in her heart.
And the curse won't last forever. It will end.
In 28 years, there'll be a savior,
and she'll break it.
28 years?
You won't even notice.
You'll be frozen, like all those in this corner of the land.
But when the curse ends,
and our quest will resume,
and when it does,
Regina will truly have lost everything,
and then she'll need me.
That's when we'll go to this new land.
You'll get your revenge.
And me, I'll...
help her pick up the pieces.
You're certain the portal's going to open up all the way out here?
There.
This is where things once lost are returned to us.
This is where Cora's gonna come through.
Unless it's Mary Margaret and Emma...
I highly doubt that.
We are going to get out of here.
How? By staring at that scroll?
It's not like it's gonna magically open the door for us.
Yes, it is.
What?
When I was a little girl, I used to sneak into Cora's chamber
and watch her practice magic.
She had a spell book, and, Emma,
the spells were in the book.
Yeah. Isn't that what a spell book is a book that has spells in it?
Watch.
Squid ink.
Gold wrote the scroll in squid ink.
Told ya.
Good always wins.
Wait. I can't go. You have to tie me up.
No. I'm not leaving without you.
I can't be trusted, not as long as Cora has my heart.
Then I will get it back for you.
Mulan.
I will.
Mulan...
We gotta go.
Do it.
Good luck.
Thank you.
Good luck to you.
And now the ashes.
Would you care to do the honors?
Here we go.
We'll be in Storybrooke soon enough.
I really look forward to seeing my daughter.
It's time.
So what are we waiting for?
Doesn't matter who comes through now.
No one can survive this.
I told you I'd deliver you to Rumplestiltskin.
Now don't let go,
unless you want to end up
someplace that isn't Storybrooke.
You're not going anywhere! This portal's taking us home!
The compass--get it.
Find it first. I'll take care of them.
I may be a pirate,
but I bristle at the thought of a woman losing her heart,
unless it's over me.
Go!
No, but you need the compass.
And Aurora needs her heart.
Take it.
It deflects her magic.
I had no idea you had such a soft side.
I don't. Just like a fair fight.
Good form. But not good enough.
Normally,
I prefer to do other more enjoyable activities
with a woman on her back.
With my life on the line, you've left me no choice.
A bit of advice?
When I jab you with my sword, you'll feel it.
You might want to quit.
Why would I do that when I'm winning?
Thanks.
Now let's go home!
Mom?
You're not helping Emma and Mary Margaret, are you?
I'm helping you, Henry.
What are you talking about?
You're gonna kill them.
Sorry, dearie.
Mom, what are you doing?
We can't let Cora come through the portal.
You have no idea what she would do to us.
Emma and Mary Margaret are going to defeat her.
They're the ones that are gonna come through.
Henry, your mother's right. It's gonna be Cora.
No. It won't.
Good always defeats evil.
You should know that more than anyone.
What I know is my mother will destroy
everything I love,
and that means you,
and I can't let that happen.
Emma, run!
Why do you want to go to Storybrooke?
Because my daughter needs me.
The one thing she's always wanted--
Your heart.
Good-bye, Snow.
No! Emma!
Oh, you foolish girl.
Don't you know?
Love is weakness.
No.
It's strength.
What was that?
That is a great subject for discussion...
When we get home.
You ready?
Yeah.
Let's go.
You can't! Stop it!
You can't!
You're gonna kill them!
Please!
No!
They're going to make it through!
We have to turn it off!
You're gonna kill them!
Oh! Henry!
What are you doing?
Emma and Mary Margaret are going to come through.
I know it.
You said you wanted to change,
to be better.
This is how.
You want me to have faith in you?
Have faith in me
Regina.
No!
I'm sorry, Henry,
I'm sorry.
Mom?
Henry!
Mom!
Oh! I missed you!
I missed you, too.
I missed you so much.
What's going on?
What happened?
She saved you. She saved both of you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Are you okay?
Where's my husband?
I need to find him.
Um, your mom--
She's, uh...
She's...
A piece of work, you know?
Indeed I do.
Welcome back.
Thanks.
David!
You...
You did it.
Did you ever doubt I would?
No.
Though the burning red room did give me pause.
We need to talk.
Yes.
I believe apologies are in order.
No.
No apologies necessary.
I understand why you wanted to keep Cora out of here.
Just remind me never to bet against you in the future,
Ms. Swan.
It's not really a bet when the game is rigged, is it?
To what exactly are you referring?
Your scroll.
I saw it in your cell.
You wrote my name again and again and again.
Just wanted to make sure it would stick.
The ink--it was there all the time.
You could've gotten out.
I was exactly where I wanted to be.
You needed to find that so all this could occur.
You created the curse, Gold.
You made me the savior.
So everything I've ever done...
It's exactly what you wanted me to do.
I created the curse, dearie, but I didn't make you.
I merely took advantage of what you are--
The product of true love.
That's why you're powerful.
And everything you've done,
you've done yourself.
So you don't know.
Know what?
Cora... tried to rip my heart out,
but she couldn't.
She was blasted back by something inside me,
by...
By...
By magic.
Whatever that was, I didn't do that.
You did.
Have you done this before?
No.
Thank you.
What now?
Cora told me something.
When a wraith consumes a soul,
it's not trapped there forever.
It can be reunited with its body.
You think we can save Phillip?
We can try.
Then let's try.
We failed.
Really, Cora,
after all this time, why do you still doubt me?
That bean's petrified. It's useless.
But these waters have regenerative properties.
Perhaps it's time to do some gardening.
I was right.
You really have changed.
Thank you.
Emma.
Emma.
Looks like we have some catching up to do.
You have no idea.
How about dinner at Granny's? On me.
As long as it's not Chimera, I'm in.
Hey, kid. You hungry?
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
Congratulations.
You just reunited mother and son.
Maybe one day,
they'll even invite you for dinner.
There it is.
