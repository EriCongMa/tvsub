第十八集
once upon a time , an evil queen
banished every storybook character you &apos;ve ever known
to our world .
who knows the truth
and who can break the spell ?
you don &apos;t play with the curse .
the evidence is piling up by the hour .
you want me to run ?
it &apos;s your choice .
everyone thinks i killed kathryn .
you have to trust me . i can get you out of this .
i think you &apos;d be well @-@ advised to bring me on as your counsel .
what is she doing here ? i made a deal with you , gold .
fear not , your majesty . you may yet get what you want .
remembrance of things past ?
what do you want ?
i need a favor .
you need a favor from me ?
well , as you know ,
there are battery charges against me pending .
i really don &apos;t relish the thought of spending
any more time locked up in a cage .
now someone with your influence
can make the d.a. suddenly realize
what a flimsy case they have .
isn &apos;t that right ...
your majesty ?
what do i get out of it ?
help with your mary margaret problem .
you see , i &apos;ve noticed
that no matter how hard you seem to try to stop them ,
she and her charming friend
just keep finding ways to be together .
what are you suggesting ?
if you want to inflict pain ...
then you must inflict pain .
if something tragic ...
were to happen to david &apos;s wife ,
and if mary margaret should take the blame--
she &apos;d be ruined .
and you &apos;d have your victory ,
at last .
a trial could be very messy .
a trial ? who said anything about a trial ?
now once ms. blanchard has been incarcerated ,
you can plant one of your lovely skeleton keys in her cell .
and once she tries to leave storybrooke , well ...
we all know what happens
to people that attempt to leave town .
give me one good reason why i should trust you .
because i always honor my agreements .
do we have a deal ?
yes !
that &apos;s beautiful , sweetheart .
oh , thank you , daddy .
beautiful ?
i &apos;d hardly call that beautiful .
you didn &apos;t like it , mother ?
you ride like a man .
a lady should be graceful .
you should use a saddle .
i was just having fun .
you &apos;re getting a little old for fun .
who &apos;s going to want to marry you when you behave like a commoner ?
honey , please leave her alone .
stop coddling her .
she &apos;s becoming an old maid .
all the other girls her age are married .
i had such high hopes .
milady , perhaps this saddle--
i &apos;m done riding for the day .
and don &apos;t ever interrupt me and my mother again .
why do you always have to criticize me ?
i &apos;m not criticizing you .
i &apos;m helping you .
don &apos;t you walk away from me .
mother !
you know i don &apos;t like it when you use magic .
and i don &apos;t like insolence .
i &apos;ll stop using magic
when you start being an obedient daughter .
why can &apos;t i just be myself ?
oh , because you can be so much more
if you &apos;d just let me help you .
i don &apos;t care about status .
i just want to be--oh !
cora , please .
please .
i &apos;ll be good .
excellent .
that &apos;s all i wanted to hear .
daniel ...
i &apos;m sorry i snapped at you .
that &apos;s all right .
you &apos;ll just have to find some way to make it up to me .
emma .
david , i don &apos;t have time .
no , i @-@ i understand .
it &apos;s mary margaret . how &apos;s she doing ?
how do you think she &apos;s doing ?
well , i think the last time we spoke ,
she didn &apos;t quite get what i meant .
oh , you mean that you basically told her
you thought she might be guilty ?
look , it &apos;s this situation .
it &apos;s been confusing and horrible for everyone .
but , emma , i don &apos;t think she &apos;s guilty .
i need her to know that .
can i see her ?
she doesn &apos;t want visitors .
you mean me . she doesn &apos;t want to see me .
honestly , david , i &apos;m sure your heart is in the right place ,
but the last thing she needs right now is
words of encouragement from you .
what does she need ?
a miracle .
they say only the guilty sleep in prison .
what are you doing here ?
where &apos;s emma ?
she hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
i just wanted to stop by to offer you a chance--
a chance to spare yourself and this town the messiness of a trial ,
the chance to confess .
but i didn &apos;t kill kathryn .
why won &apos;t anyone believe me ?
the murder weapon was found in your apartment .
your fingerprint was on the box containing kathryn &apos;s heart .
shall i go on ?
why not , for once ,
make it easier on everyone ?
because confession or not ,
you &apos;re leaving storybrooke .
and you like that .
why ?
why do you take such pleasure in this ?
what did i ever do to you to make you hate me so much ?
i thought we could take a ride to firefly hill .
we can make it by sundown , have a picnic .
i can &apos;t . i have to be back in an hour .
tea time .
a lady never misses her tea time .
this is absurd .
stealing kisses between lunch and tea ?
when are you gonna tell your parents about us ?
it &apos;s not my parents .
it &apos;s her .
i don &apos;t understand .
so i work in the stables .
she started out as the daughter of a miller .
wouldn &apos;t she , of all people , understand ?
she does .
but she thinks one &apos;s trajectory needs to keep moving up and--
and i &apos;m down .
she believes that . daniel ...
i know better .
regina , tell her .
she &apos;ll get over it . what can she do ?
have you not seen her magic ?
the real question is what can &apos;t she do ?
who cares about magic ?
true love is the most powerful magic of all .
it can overcome anything .
help !
someone &apos;s here .
somebody , help me !
come on , please , stop ! help me !
help ! help me ! please help me !
give me your hand !
it &apos;s okay , dear . you &apos;re safe .
you saved my life .
are you all right ?
yes .
but i &apos;ll never ride again .
nonsense .
the only way to overcome fear is to face it ,
to get back on that horse as soon as possible .
thank you .
regina .
i &apos;m snow .
snow white .
a pretrial interview with the prosecution ?
explain to me how that is a good idea .
the d.a. merely wishes to ask ms. blanchard a few questions .
she &apos;s done answering questions .
and why are we kissing up to the d.a. ?
why aren &apos;t we going after regina ?
she &apos;s the one who &apos;s setting up mary margaret .
and what proof do we have of that , sheriff ?
just because you found the mayor &apos;s skeleton key
in the cell doesn &apos;t mean we can prove she put it there .
so what &apos;s your plan ?
i believe our best chance of winning this case
is to employ our most valuable asset .
what &apos;s that ?
well , that &apos;s you , dear .
a sweet , kind elementary schoolteacher .
doesn &apos;t exactly fit the prototype of a killer , now does it ?
that &apos;s how you &apos;re gonna get her acquitted ?
by using her personality ?
perception is everything , ms. swan--
not just in the courtroom , but in life .
as such , i &apos;m sure you can imagine
how the jury would perceive ms. blanchard
if she agreed to cooperate with the district attorney .
these things engender trust .
it shows the jury she &apos;s at least trying--
emma ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
i just , uh , came by to drop these off .
i thought they might brighten the place up .
what did you find ?
nothing .
i- i &apos;m sorry , emma . i tried . i really did .
i looked into her phone records .
i talked to the people at the toll bridge .
but look , what can i say ?
regina knows how to cover her tracks .
what about the murder weapon ?
you find anything tying her to that ?
from what i can tell , she never bought or owned a hunting knife .
that &apos;s all you were able to uncover ?
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m gonna keep digging ,
and i won &apos;t stop until i do find something .
i &apos;m gonna do it .
i &apos;m going to talk to the d.a.
are you sure ?
mr. gold &apos;s right .
i know i have nothing to hide , but no one else does .
i need to let people see me for who i am .
excellent decision , ms. blanchard .
my name is spencer . i &apos;m the district attorney .
shall we begin ?
yeah .
after she learned about your affair , mrs. nolan , the deceased ,
came to your school to confront you . is that correct ?
she was hurt , and she felt betrayed .
she struck you--
in the face , was it ?
yes , but--
that must &apos;ve made you angry .
you-- you don &apos;t have to answer that .
no , it &apos;s okay .
i was not angry .
i was sorry for all the pain i had caused her .
ms. blanchard ,
this is not a courtroom . i &apos;m not here to judge you .
you can be honest with me .
shall we end this ?
i am being honest with you .
the wife of the man you loved
humiliated you in a public forum .
surely you must have felt some anger towards kathryn .
yes , i was angry--
and did you ever think about acting upon that anger ?
of course not .
i have a hard time believing that .
wh @-@ why ?
because you wanted kathryn nolan gone .
i never said that .
all right .
my client is answering no more questions for the day .
your client agreed to this interview
because she claimed she had nothing to hide .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide .
then what is your answer ?
you wanted kathryn gone , didn &apos;t you ?
no .
even after she tried to keep you and david apart ?
after she slapped you in public ?
after she made you a pariah in your own town ?
yes , of course i wanted her gone .
she was the only thing keeping us apart ,
so yeah , i wanted her gone . is that what you wanna hear ?
no , this won &apos;t do .
what are you doing ?
we have a guest . he &apos;ll be here any moment .
i can &apos;t . i have a riding lesson with daniel .
well , that &apos;s been canceled .
now smile . we don &apos;t want to disappoint him .
disappoint who ?
the king .
the king ?
why is the king coming ?
because you &apos;ve finally done something right .
that little girl you saved is the king &apos;s daughter .
is that her ?
yes .
regina , honey ,
this is snow white &apos;s father .
no .
it is i who should bow to you .
you saved my daughter &apos;s life .
there is no way to repay that debt .
it is an honor to meet you .
regina , dear , the king &apos;s honored to meet you .
say something .
the honor is mine .
you &apos;re quite lucky to have a mother who looks out for you .
my dear snow has many things ,
but a mother is not one of them .
we lost her years ago .
i &apos;m so sorry .
since then i have scoured the land looking for a wife .
i &apos;ve yet to find a woman with an interest in my daughter ...
until now .
will you marry me , regina ?
yes .
yes .
daniel ?
daniel !
what is it ?
marry me .
regina , what are you doing ?
what &apos;s happened ? did you tell your mother ?
no . now i can never tell her .
she won &apos;t understand .
that girl i saved
was the king &apos;s daughter .
and now he &apos;s proposed to me .
what ?
my mother accepted !
the only way out is to run .
for us to leave this place ,
for us to be married , for us to never come back .
regina ...
do you understand what that would mean ?
life with a stable boy
is a far cry from a life as queen .
being queen means nothing .
daniel ...
all i care about is you .
then if i am to marry you ,
we must do this properly .
here .
snow !
dear , what are you doing ?
you said to get back on the horse and ...
what are you doing with him ?
snow , i can explain .
no .
no . snow ! snow !
snow !
snow ! wait !
snow !
snow !
are you okay ?
no .
no .
why were you kissing that man in the stable ?
you &apos;re to marry my father .
you &apos;re to be my mother .
oh , snow , please , listen to me .
your father ,
king leopold-- he &apos;s a kind and fair man ...
but i don &apos;t love him .
i don &apos;t understand .
why not ?
love doesn &apos;t work that way .
love ...
true love ...
is magic .
and not just any magic--
the most powerful magic of all .
it creates happiness .
and that man in the stables ...
you love him ?
with all my heart .
then you must marry him .
i will go tell father right away .
n @-@ no . no . no . no . you can &apos;t .
why not ?
surely he &apos;ll understand .
perhaps , but not everyone will .
my mother , for one-- she &apos;ll stand in the way .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re running .
it &apos;s the only way our love can survive .
snow , do you know what a secret is ?
if you really , truly want to help me ...
i do .
then what you saw , what i told you ,
you must keep it a secret .
can you do that ?
i think so .
i need you to be certain .
you can never speak of this .
and above all , you mustn &apos;t tell my mother .
will you do that for me ?
yes .
i promise .
what you doing ?
grasping at straws .
still trying to find a way
to prove your friend &apos;s been framed ?
every time i go down a path i think leads somewhere ,
it ends up being a dead end .
i used to think i had these great instincts ...
superpower . now i don &apos;t know .
it sounds like you got a case of writer &apos;s block ,
only without the whole writing part .
maybe .
you know , when i get struck by a block ,
i usually reread what i &apos;ve done
rather than plow ahead blindly .
sometimes i find there &apos;ll be
a little nugget of inspiration left behind .
you mean start over ?
i mean , when i start writing , i usually have one idea ,
and then in the middle , i may get another idea ,
and things are different .
so your perspective changes .
exactly .
when you started this investigation ,
what was it about ?
a missing person .
then it became a murder
and then a cover @-@ up .
if you knew that then ,
maybe you would have approached things differently .
where you going ?
scene of the crime .
i &apos;ll drive .
no , i &apos;m fine .
no , you &apos;re not . you haven &apos;t slept in days .
and let &apos;s be honest ,
it was my idea .
ruby found the box with the heart right over here ,
just by the shore .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
it doesn &apos;t seem like nothing .
here . let me look .
no , it &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s just a shin splint . just let me walk it off .
sorry .
i know this must be hard on you .
yeah , that &apos;s an understatement .
i don &apos;t know you that well ,
but it seems to me , that aside from henry ,
mary margaret &apos;s the closest thing to family you &apos;ve got .
it &apos;s okay to admit it .
august , look .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a shard .
from a shovel .
must &apos;ve broken off when it hit a rock .
if we can find the shovel that it broke off of ,
we can prove that mary margaret didn &apos;t bury the heart .
we can prove that she &apos;s innocent .
and i &apos;m gonna guess you know exactly whose shovel it is .
the eagle is in the nest ,
and the package is secure .
henry .
i left the code book at home .
she &apos;s getting in the shower
and the keys are under the mat .
don &apos;t touch a thing .
we got her .
careful , sweetheart .
a flower is a delicate thing .
be gentle .
you want it to grow
and not pluck it before its time .
sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
you needn &apos;t fear me . i &apos;m only trying to help .
perhaps you could be the flower girl at the wedding .
i can already see how close you and regina have become .
she &apos;s going to make a fine mother for you .
she is kind to me .
indeed .
it warms my heart how you two share everything ...
already .
perhaps you could share something with me .
why has she pulled away from me ?
what do you mean ?
a mother knows her daughter .
regina &apos;s pulled away .
i love her so much , but she &apos;s not letting me help her ,
and i ... i know she &apos;s unhappy .
has she said something ?
i &apos;d do anything to make her happy .
you &apos;d do anything ?
of course , dear .
you know , i &apos;ve talked to the king about your mother .
he told me how much she loved you .
losing her must &apos;ve been so hard .
it was .
hearing him , i realized he might as well have been talking
about me and regina .
i don &apos;t want us to lose each other .
if only i could show her how i feel ,
that no matter what , all i want is her happiness .
then don &apos;t make her get married .
i &apos;m sorry ?
she doesn &apos;t love my father .
she loves someone else .
she made me promise not to tell .
but she &apos;ll lose you .
she can &apos;t lose her mother .
no one should .
oh , sweet snow , it &apos;s all right .
she won &apos;t lose me .
you can tell me .
you must tell me .
can i help you , sheriff swan ?
yes . i need you to unlock the garage for me .
and why would i do that ?
because i have a search warrant that says that you have to .
on what grounds ?
i found this near where the heart was buried ,
figured whoever buried it might have left something behind .
then i got an anonymous call from someone
who said they saw you digging near the toll bridge
the day the heart was found .
an &quot; anonymous call &quot; ?
yeah . well , i can &apos;t control the fact he didn &apos;t leave a name .
i suppose he didn &apos;t want to risk pissing you off .
now open the garage or i &apos;ll find a way to do it myself .
where is it ?
where is what , sheriff ?
you knew i was coming .
how on earth would i know that ?
mary margaret is a good person . she doesn &apos;t deserve this .
ms. blanchard is a liar and a murderer .
no matter what accusations you throw my way ,
that won &apos;t change .
she &apos;s going to pay for what she &apos;s done .
that woman has destroyed
the last life she is ever going to destroy .
how could you do this ?
how could you do this to me ? to mary margaret ?
slow down . do what ?
the shovel was gone when i got there .
regina knew i was coming for it .
you--you think that i told her ?
you were the only other person who knew about it .
i would hope that you would have enough faith
to know that i would never betray you .
why should i ? how do i know you &apos;re not lying about this ?
about everything ?
i &apos;m not a liar .
that is exactly what a liar would say .
having a bad day ?
what are you doing here ?
i wanted to see you while i can .
what does that mean ?
simply that the trial starts tomorrow ,
and it won &apos;t be a long one ,
and you &apos;ll be sent out of storybrooke for good ,
and i will never have to see you again .
oh , i want to enjoy this while i still can .
enjoy what ?
justice .
justice ?
watching an innocent suffer ?
you &apos;ve always seen yourself that way , haven &apos;t you ?
innocent .
i am innocent !
i don &apos;t know what this is about !
i don &apos;t know what i ever did to you ,
but whatever it was , regina ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i truly am .
apology not accepted .
please . don &apos;t do this to me .
i don &apos;t deserve this . i did not kill kathryn .
oh , i know .
but you do deserve this .
are you ready ?
let &apos;s go .
you could &apos;ve at least left a note .
mother , i--
don &apos;t .
you sneak out of my house in the dead of night
and think i won &apos;t notice ? how dare you .
you &apos;re impossible to talk to .
stop with the magic and listen to me .
i want to be with daniel .
oh , you don &apos;t know what you want ,
but i do .
i didn &apos;t make the sacrifices i did in life
to get you to the cusp of greatness
so that you could end up the wife of a stable boy .
but it &apos;s my life .
you foolish girl .
it &apos;s mine .
after what i had to do--
the deals i had to make to get us out of poverty ,
to get us this life ,
and you just want to toss it away ?
stay strong , regina .
your magic can &apos;t keep us apart .
i love him .
and i love her .
and i love her , too .
if you loved me , you wouldn &apos;t try to keep us apart .
and if you loved me , you wouldn &apos;t try to run away .
i &apos;m sorry , but this is my happiness .
we &apos;re going .
no .
you &apos;re not .
so what &apos;s your plan ?
you &apos;re going to keep us here forever ?
because that &apos;s what you &apos;ll have to do .
so this is ...
your decision ?
this will make you happy ?
it already has .
then who am i to stop you ?
thank you , mother .
daniel .
if you want to have a life together , a family ...
then there &apos;s one important lesson i can impart on you .
it &apos;s what it means to be a parent .
you always have to do what &apos;s best for your children .
thank you .
i understand .
because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing now .
yes . it is .
mother !
no !
no ! no . no . no . no . no .
mother , why have you done this ?
because this is your happy ending .
what ?
oh , you have to trust me , regina .
i know best .
love is weakness , regina .
it feels real now . at the start , it always does .
but it &apos;s an illusion .
it fades ,
and then you &apos;re left with nothing .
but power ...
true power endures .
and then you don &apos;t have to rely on anyone to get what you want .
i &apos;ve saved you , my love .
you &apos;ve ruined everything .
i loved him .
i loved him !
enough !
i &apos;ve endured this long enough .
now clean yourself up ,
wipe away your tears ,
because now ...
you &apos;re going to be queen .
you are most certainly the fairest of them all !
thank you , dear .
i hope for my wedding day i will be as beautiful .
i &apos;m sure you will be .
i know you and daniel will be so happy together .
what ?
well , i just knew your mother would let you marry him ,
once she knew how happy it &apos;d make you ,
once she knew how much you love him .
you have such a wonderful mother .
she would do anything for your happiness .
snow ...
did ...
did you ... tell her
about me and daniel ?
yes .
but i told you ...
very specifically not to .
i &apos;m sorry .
i just didn &apos;t want you to lose your mother ,
like i &apos;ve lost mine .
are you mad ?
no .
i &apos;m not mad at all .
you were just trying to help me .
however , i &apos;m not marrying daniel .
this dress is for your father .
but ... i thought ...
you were in love .
so did i.
but i was wrong .
daniel has run away .
what i had with daniel wasn &apos;t real .
it was an infatuation .
you see , that &apos;s the thing about love .
it can come in the most unexpected places .
your father and i have something even more special
because it &apos;s not just about the two of us .
it &apos;s about all of us .
we &apos;re going to be a family .
we are ?
that &apos;s right .
i &apos;m going to be your stepmother , and i couldn &apos;t be happier .
me , too .
snow , you need to go to your room and help with the packing .
your father wants you ready for the journey ,
and we &apos;re heading to your castle first thing in the morning .
you &apos;re both going to love it there .
i know we will .
well @-@ played , dear .
you &apos;re learning .
i should change .
i wouldn &apos;t want to ruin the dress before my big day .
i am so proud of you .
you knew the king was traveling through our land , didn &apos;t you ?
that steed with snow on it--
it didn &apos;t go wild on its own .
did it ?
i have no idea what you &apos;re saying .
i should &apos;ve let her die on that horse .
we got her , daniel .
we got her .
mary margaret .
you told me you could fix this .
that &apos;s why i came to you .
so that you could make sure regina didn &apos;t win .
she hasn &apos;t yet .
well , she &apos;s going to ,
and now my friend is gonna pay for me trusting you .
look , sheriff , i know this is emotional ,
but it &apos;s also not over .
you must have faith . there &apos;s still time .
time for what ?
for me to work a little magic .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
for doubting you .
i made a mistake .
what &apos;s that ?
evidence .
evidence that proves
that i &apos;ve been trusting all the wrong people .
i should have listened to you .
this bug was from sidney .
the newspaper guy ?
i should &apos;ve seen it .
well , don &apos;t beat yourself up about it , emma .
sometimes it &apos;s hard to see what &apos;s right in front of us ,
but i knew you would .
i &apos;m trying .
ruby !
what &apos;s going on ?
she--she--she &apos;s in the alley .
who , ruby ? what happened ?
hey , you all right ?
