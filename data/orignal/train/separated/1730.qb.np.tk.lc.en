第七季 第八集
hey , can i ask you a question ?
sure .
you &apos;ve had this dart board since i &apos;ve known you ,
but i &apos;ve never seen you play .
oh , uh , we played ... once .
i broke a window .
what window ?
that one over there .
leonard , where are the skee @-@ ball tickets ?
skee @-@ ball tickets ?
yeah , from when we went to the arcade three years ago ?
i finally decided what prize i want .
hurry up .
uh , if i still have them ,
they &apos;re probably in the junk box .
ooh , what are you gonna get ?
none of your business .
but when you see me wearing a flower
in my lapel later ,
you are most welcome to sniff it .
yup , oh ... here you go .
oh , thank you .
here , get yourself an eraser for your troubles .
i forgot about this .
my aunt made it for me when i started college .
aw , did she hate you ?
why ? because i got an ugly , itchy sweater ,
and my brother got a car ? no , i was her favorite .
yeah , i seem to be a few tickets short .
are there more in the box ?
hmm , i think i got them all .
nope , they &apos;re not in there .
well , you barely looked . let me see .
no , no , no , i @-@ i looked , and ...
no more tickets .
leonard , let me look in the box .
okay , okay !
i &apos;m gonna show you what &apos;s in the box .
but just ... promise not to flip out .
why would i flip out ?
is it a spider ?
it &apos;s a spider !
no , if it was a spider ,
lenny would &apos;ve flipped out .
okay , sheldon ,
i know i was supposed to return this dvd a long time ago ,
and i know we rented it on your card .
but it &apos;s been , like , seven years
and clearly nothing bad has happened .
so in @-@ in @-@ in @-@ instead of being
a giant pain in the ass like you always are ,
what if this one time
you just tried staying calm ?
that seems like a reasonable request .
although so did , &quot; hey , leonard ,
would you mind returning that dvd ? &quot;
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll @-@ ill take care of it .
okay .
i mean it , i &apos;m going to .
i believe you .
and you &apos;re going to stay calm ?
i said i would .
how about that ?
sheldon &apos;s being reasonable .
yeah , it &apos;s freaking me out . i &apos;m gonna go .
so ... when you say
you &apos;re not going to freak out about the dvd ,
here &apos;s what that means .
don &apos;t fixate on it .
don &apos;t wake me up in the middle of the night .
or nag me through the door
while i &apos;m on the toilet .
okay , first , talking to you while you &apos;re on the toilet
isn &apos;t exactly a picnic for me either , okay ?
remember ...
when you can hear me , i can hear you .
and second ...
you completely disregard
how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s like , a ...
an itch in my brain i can &apos;t scratch .
when i broke my arm i used
to stick a coat hanger down there .
you ever try that ? maybe go in through the ear ?
you wouldn &apos;t make jokes if you could feel the way i feel .
well , i don &apos;t know how to do that .
how about this ?
i promise i won &apos;t pester you about the dvd .
you can defecate in peace .
that &apos;s a win for both of us . but ...
until this matter is resolved ,
i would like you
to wear this sweater .
with nothing underneath it .
that &apos;s stupid . why ?
you say it &apos;s itchy and uncomfortable .
i say situations like this make me feel the same way .
i &apos;m telling you , try the hanger .
put it on .
let &apos;s share the experience .
you got it .
if this sweater shuts you up ,
i &apos;m gonna make a fortune
selling them to everyone we know .
now ...
all i need to do is head down to the video store
and return the dvd .
oh , did i forget to tell you ?
that store went out of business years ago .
really ?
how those nipples feeling , chief ?
penny , can we please get our drinks ?
yeah , hang on , just give me sec .
at work today , i did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery .
cool . at my lab ,
i performed ten laser capture micro @-@ dissections .
i scraped gum off the bottom of that table .
only &apos; cause my manager saw me put it there .
oh , my gosh .
that &apos;s the girl that broke rajesh &apos;s heart .
that &apos;s lucy ?
i don &apos;t know why but i always pictured her as indian .
i think that reason &apos;s called racism .
i &apos;m gonna go talk to her .
why ? what are you gonna say ?
i &apos;m not gonna say anything .
i just want to check her out .
because she hurt my friend .
my indian friend .
who &apos;s racist now ?
you .
because you just called him your &quot; indian friend . &quot;
yeah , well , you &apos;re short .
we &apos;re never getting our drinks .
no , but we knew that .
hey , can i start you off with something to drink ?
oh , water would be great .
okay .
um , you &apos;re lucy , right ?
i &apos;m a friend of raj koothrappali &apos;s .
actually amy recognized you .
how &apos;s he doing ?
oh , you know , he &apos;s good .
great .
yeah , this is none of my business .
but why did you break up with him in an e @-@ mail ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
i guess i thought it would be easier .
yeah , i get that .
i &apos;ll go get you your water .
when you say &quot; easier , &quot;
you mean easier for you , right ?
&apos;cause it certainly didn &apos;t make it easier for him .
any chance i can get a different waitress ?
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry , this is rude of me .
i will go get that water .
see , see , see , see .
just now you expressed your feelings to my face .
how come you could do that with me , but not raj ?
i don &apos;t know your e @-@ mail .
you know what the worst part is ?
you &apos;re sitting here , perfectly happy
and he &apos;s at home , a blubbering mess .
oh , i thought you said he was okay .
well , i also said i was getting you water ,
but look at me still standing here .
you know , i may be a bad waitress ,
but you are a bad person .
now , you want to hear the specials ?
so , you can never take it off ?
no .
not even to sleep ?
no .
so , you &apos;re just an idiot ?
it &apos;s called proving a point .
is the point you &apos;re an idiot ?
gentlemen , please .
leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes .
he can &apos;t walk in my actual shoes .
he has the feet of a toddler .
so , how are you gonna return the dvd
if the store went out of business ?
monday morning i &apos;ll go downtown
look up the owner &apos;s information .
and send him the dvd .
pay the late fee .
and prove to sheldon
that you can have a problem and solve it ...
... without acting like a complete lunatic .
and the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know
that &quot; only you can prevent forest fires . &quot;
其身上印有 &quot; only you can prevent forest fires &quot; 字样
i don &apos;t get it .
you didn &apos;t have smokey the bear in india ?
no .
oh , is he anything like , uh , mun @-@ mun the mongoose ?
he taught us not to play with cobras .
you had to be taught not to play with cobras ?
you had to be taught not to burn down the forest ?
hey , if you guys were hungry ,
why didn &apos;t you order something at the restaurant ?
we did , you never brought it .
oh , that &apos;s right .
nachos and a turkey club .
not even close .
well , i was too busy standing up
for my friend to worry about your ...
i want to say salmon .
you want to say sorry .
so , how are you gonna tell raj abut what you did ?
what do you mean &quot; how &quot; ? what &apos;s the big deal ?
you told lucy he was a pathetic mess .
then you made her cry and leave .
okay , you guys are overreacting .
raj is gonna appreciate how i had his back .
what is wrong with you , penny ? !
you ruined any chance i had of getting back with lucy !
now she knows i &apos;m a desperate mess
instead of just being pretty sure !
it &apos;s lucy .
she wants to meet for coffee .
i love you , penny !
hey , what &apos;re you working on ?
i &apos;m thinking about how one could use
the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror
turns virtual photons into real ones
as a method of observing dark energy .
that &apos;s a pretty cool idea .
yeah . it &apos;s great you &apos;re here .
i &apos;d love to get an engineer &apos;s opinion .
sure .
this chair is squeaky .
now , do i fix it or get a new one ?
well , sheldon , it took me all morning ,
but i found the owner of the video store .
and i am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep ,
drunk at the bottom of a pool .
anyway , there is no one to return the dvd to ,
so this issue is resolved .
and i &apos;d just like to point out that
even though the sweater was uncomfortable ,
i didn &apos;t use it as an excuse
to antagonize everyone around me .
you know , you could reimburse the video store owner &apos;s next of kin .
or it &apos;s resolved !
hey , that next of kin thing sounds pretty good .
i believe this is yours .
can i ask you guys a question ?
so , i &apos;m seeing lucy tomorrow night ,
and i &apos;ve never hung out with someone who broke up with me .
how do you do it ?
you can &apos;t let her know you &apos;re hurting .
you know , the key is confidence .
why is the key always confidence ?
how come it &apos;s never love handles and flop sweat ?
if this girl hurt you so much ,
are you sure you want to see her again ?
well , if i may ...
he has so little self @-@ respect
and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection ,
she could literally sleep with his own father
in his own bed and post the video to youtube ,
and he &apos;d still buy her flowers
and ask her to be his bride .
he &apos;s right .
but in my defense , if we could survive that ,
we could survive anything .
well , if you &apos;re sure you want to do this ,
it &apos;s only coffee ...
just relax and see what happens .
well , can i say she looks nice ?
sure .
can i tell her i miss her ?
maybe , if she asks .
oh , can i show her an oil painting i made
of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren ?
i &apos;d save that for the second date .
good , good .
&apos;cause no matter how hard i try ,
i cannot get the twins to look alike .
what are you doing ?
oh , i &apos;m just trying to find the stupid next of kin
to this stupid video store owner so i can return the dvd
and see the look on sheldon &apos;s stupid face
when he sees that i didn &apos;t let this get to me .
sheldon &apos;s not here .
why don &apos;t you take the sweater off ?
th @-@ th @-@ there &apos;s a principle at stake !
which is ?
oh , i don &apos;t know .
who cares ? look at me !
oh , my god !
is that sweater made of bees ?
come on , take it off . i won &apos;t tell .
no , no , honey , if i take it off , sheldon wins .
sweetie ...
every night you don &apos;t kill him in his sleep ,
he wins .
nah , i @-@ it &apos;s ... it &apos;s almost done .
i just , i have to find ... the next of kin ,
and send &apos; em the dvd
and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die
so i can get a skin graft .
smile .
what @-@ what is that ? what is that for ?
so you can send it to princeton
and get your money back .
i must say , sheldon ,
you &apos;re handling this dvd business
with an impressive amount of maturity .
i don &apos;t know why that surprises you .
i &apos;m a grown man .
as should be evident by this sport coat
and very real flower in my lapel .
is there some kind of new coping mechanism you &apos;re employing ?
the more interesting question you should be asking is ,
&quot; what does this flower smell like ? &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go with sad .
so what &apos;s the story with you and this dvd ?
there &apos;s nothing to tell .
maybe i purchased a book entitled ,
don &apos;t sweat the small stuff
and i followed its wise suggestions ,
one of which was :
stop and smell the flowers .
seriously ?
please .
hi .
hello .
oh , it &apos;s so good to see you .
you , too .
please , sit .
i , uh , i got you a cappuccino .
i remembered it was your favorite .
i also got crumb cake ,
but i remembered it was my favorite and i ate it .
anyway , uh , how are you ?
i &apos;m pretty good .
listen , i just wanted to apologize
for breaking up with you in an e @-@ mail .
well , and i ate all the crumb cake .
we both made mistakes .
okay .
i &apos;m so happy you asked me here ,
and i hope we can hang out again sometime .
you know , as friends ,
lovemaking partners , whatever .
i &apos;m kind of seeing someone .
i think i know the answer to this ,
but just to be clear , it &apos;s not me , right ?
this is all your fault !
i should &apos;ve listened to mun @-@ mun
because i &apos;ve been playing with a cobra
and her name is penny !
why are you so cruel ?
do you enjoy my pain ?
there &apos;s a girl at the cheesecake factory i can set you up with .
i love you , penny !
how is it i can conceptualize a methodology
of examining dark matter in the universe
but can &apos;t figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower ?
i think the real question is ,
why do you waste your time with cheap , childish pranks ?
there &apos;s probably a deep reason .
which i &apos;d be happy to discuss with you
over some peanut brittle in a can .
okay , sheldon , i am out of options !
video store owner , nursis manookian ,
has no next of kin !
well , you seem hot under the collar ...
or is that the sweater ?
oh , oh , no , no .
i @-@ it &apos;s because i spent all afternoon
at the armenian church where his funeral mass was held .
according to father solakian ,
no one attended .
luckily , my trip wasn &apos;t a complete waste .
i lit a candle and prayed for your death .
but i &apos;m not armenian , so it probably won &apos;t work !
this is over , right ?
oh , not necessarily .
i suggest you look for long @-@ lost relatives
either in armenia or lebanon .
listen to me , sheldon .
i am not going to lebanon
to return super mario bros. the movie !
you know , it might be fun .
you love hummus .
why isn &apos;t this bothering you ?
i @-@ isn &apos;t your brain getting itchy ?
this is on your card .
this could be ruining your credit score !
why isn &apos;t this making you crazy ?
leonard ...
i have something to tell you ,
but i want you to promise not to flip out .
what ?
seven years ago ,
i found out the dvd was late
and i paid for it .
what ?
i was going to mention it at the time ,
but then i thought , some day ,
this might be a teachable moment .
i ... you ...
how can ...
what ? !
sheldon ...
that was diabolical .
i know .
and it wasn &apos;t easy .
do you have any idea what it &apos;s like to wait for years
and never know if you &apos;re going to finally get satisfaction ?
you &apos;re even prettier than penny said .
i can &apos;t believe a girl like you
doesn &apos;t have a boyfriend .
well , i don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t believe you , you &apos;re lying to me !
what ?
oh , it &apos;s okay .
i have no morals and i &apos;m desperately lonely .
i &apos;ll be the other man
if you want a little something @-@ something on the side .
what is wrong with you ? !
what is wrong with you ? !
what is wrong with you ? !
