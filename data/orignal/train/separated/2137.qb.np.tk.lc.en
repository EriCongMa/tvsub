who are you ?
i &apos;m marco reyes .
when your brother disappeared ,
he was in possession of a significant amount of my money .
$ 18.5 million .
you have until monday to bring my money to this address .
what happens if i don &apos;t bring you the money ?
you &apos;ll get a package with your brother &apos;s head in it .
reyes said that matty owed him $ 18.5 million .
you see , this is only $ 13 million .
are you sure ?
yes , i am positive . i counted it three times .
and now i am , uh , $ 5.5 million short ,
and i have two days to come up with all of it ,
or , um , my brother &apos;s dead .
i really don &apos;t see any other ways .
i may have one .
maybe we can do a little quid pro quo .
tell me what you want .
immediate transfer to the special holding unit
at the high @-@ security facility .
there i &apos;ll get a private cell ,
and for that i am willing to pay ... - $ 5.5 million .
this is gonna cost you
in ways that you could not possibly predict .
it &apos;s all there , okay ?
just , uh , let me see my brother now .
hey , matty . matty .
look at me , look at me .
nice .
nice hands , man .
awesome hands .
let &apos;s see your arm .
sorry .
don &apos;t worry about it-- come here .
see the laces ?
the laces are there for a reason , right ?
yeah .
use them .
show me .
find the grooves ,
find the grooves .
keep this loose .
okay .
all right ?
tight .
let it roll through .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s right , nice .
you feel that ?
yeah .
now you feel the difference ?
right ?
joe .
steve , where &apos;s danny ?
he &apos;s at grace &apos;s school for career day . why ?
get him out of there now .
why ? what &apos;s going on ?
there &apos;s no time to explain--
just get him out of there .
we got to go .
come on .
so like , uh , like i said ,
our job is to uphold the laws of this great country .
without policemen , without policewomen ,
uh , there &apos;d be no order .
and order is , um ...
it &apos;s the backbone to any civilized society .
and , yes , i like doughnuts very much .
if anybody has any questions ,
uh , please , you can ask them now .
yes .
what &apos;s it like cutting up dead people ?
i don &apos;t do that .
i was asking him .
the vivisection of a once @-@ living organism
as a scientific necessity
can be quite rewarding
if it yields forensic results .
is it yucky ?
quite the opposite .
thank you for asking .
okay , anybody else ?
who else ?
yes .
you ever find anything weird in the poop chute ?
settle down .
young man ,
if you &apos;re referring to the anus
or the descending colon ,
then the answer is yes .
sometimes , foreign objects can be found ...
okay . okay , max , that &apos;s good .
oh , thank you for asking .
uh , anybody have any police @-@ related questions ?
yeah .
how old do you have to be
to join the police academy ?
uh , well , that &apos;s not a relevant question
for someone who &apos;s gonna be a marine biologist ,
so we &apos;ll move on .
anybody else ?
detective daniel williams ?
yeah .
my name &apos;s deputy knox ,
u.s. marshals .
can you please place your hands behind your back ?
sure . what &apos;s this , uh ,
what &apos;s this about ?
you &apos;re under arrest for murder .
you can &apos;t do this .
sir , please step back .
for murder ? what are you talking about ?
all right , let &apos;s go .
all right , ho @-@ ho @-@ ho ...
grace , it &apos;s all right .
listen , i &apos;m gonna get this figured out .
i &apos;ll see you at home , okay ?
everything &apos;s fine .
hey , easy , easy .
they give you any other details ?
no , max said they just , they walked right in ,
th @-@ they cuffed him ,
and they hauled him away .
who &apos;s got grace ?
max is gonna take her to rachel &apos;s place .
all right , i &apos;m out the door .
i &apos;ll meet you at the federal detention center in ten .
what &apos;s your rush , lieutenant ?
coughlin .
i don &apos;t know what you want ,
but now is not the time .
unfortunately for you , it is .
grab some hood .
what ? you &apos;re arresting me ? right now ?
you got to be kidding .
what &apos;s it for this time ?
bribery , tax evasion ,
criminal misconduct ,
and my favorite ,
conspiracy to commit murder .
told you i &apos;d catch you later .
excuse me .
i need to see , uh ,
detective daniel williams .
he was just brought in here .
i &apos;m sorry , the prisoner is being processed .
and there &apos;s no visitors .
all right , look ,
i &apos;m five @-@ o , all right .
make an exception , please .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t do that .
uh , i want to speak to the watch commander .
he &apos;s gonna tell you the same thing-- no visitors .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah , chin , listen , i &apos;m here .
there &apos;s no way they &apos;re gonna let us see danny .
yo , man , where are you ?
call me , all right ?
call me when you get this .
joe , what &apos;s going on ?
not here . get in .
have a seat .
okay .
thank you , sir .
detective williams ,
my name is sam alexander ,
and i &apos;m from the state department .
oh , you &apos;re a ... you &apos;re a spook .
you should just say ,
&quot; hi , detective williams .
i &apos;m a spook . &quot;
you are going to be extradited to colombia .
and there you will stand trial for the murder of marco reyes .
yeah , that &apos;s right .
don &apos;t say anything .
just save it for your lawyer .
but y @-@ you should know
that the colombians have evidence
that puts you in the room with reyes
at the time of death .
and , of course ,
there &apos;s also motive ,
which is that you killed reyes
because he murdered your brother .
notice to waive extradition .
waive ex ...
why would i sign that ?
because you &apos;re guilty .
and we both know that .
okay , you know what , joe , help me understand .
why would the cia care about getting justice
for a drug @-@ dealing scumbag like marco reyes ?
&apos;cause he &apos;s more than just a drug @-@ dealing scumbag , steve .
what are you talking about ?
marco reyes was an agency asset .
our government invested a lot in him ,
and they don &apos;t care who danny is ;
they just want somebody to pay for the murder .
turn to your right .
reyes was helping the cia with an operation called &quot; sandpiper . &quot;
where &apos;d you get all this ?
don &apos;t ask .
here &apos;s how it worked .
wall street invested in the expanding housing market in colombia .
what they didn &apos;t realize was they were actually buying
into a cocaine cartel &apos;s laundering scheme .
when the colombian government
made a stronger push toward drug enforcement ,
u.s. banks , all of a sudden ,
started taking huge hits .
indirectly affecting the stability of our economy .
so the cia felt they had no choice but to step in ,
keep the drugs flowing to prevent a potential market crash .
and marco reyes was moving the coke .
that &apos;s right .
he &apos;s been on their books for years .
cia had him under surveillance ,
which is how they knew that danny pulled the trigger .
and that you were there to witness it .
all right ,
so they also knew that reyes killed danny &apos;s brother .
do you think they care about that ?
matthew williams was a fugitive
wanted by the fbi for fraud , money laundering ,
criminal conspiracy .
as far as the cia &apos;s concerned ,
his murder was the cost of doing business .
all right , fine , but ,
joe , you just said it--
they knew i was there , too , right ?
with danny , in colombia .
why wasn &apos;t i picked up , too ?
steve , you &apos;re a highly @-@ decorated navy seal .
a hero .
i &apos;m guessing you get a free pass .
steve , i just got a call from duke .
chin &apos;s been arrested by detective coughlin .
what ?
who &apos;s coughlin ?
he runs internal affairs for hpd .
and he &apos;s been after chin &apos;s scalp for the better part of a year .
first danny , now chin .
that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
wait a minute , did duke say that
he thinks coughlin has something ,
or is this just another one of his shakedowns ?
he said coughlin wouldn &apos;t have booked chin
unless he had something that was rock solid .
so , tax evasion , huh ?
at least , that &apos;s a new one .
don &apos;t knock it .
that &apos;s what took down capone .
only you &apos;re no capone , mr. kelly .
that &apos;s lieutenant kelly to you .
not after today .
you are done being a cop .
from here , you &apos;re going to a cell , the courtroom ,
then a concrete box for 20 years .
whatever you think you have on me , it &apos;s not gonna stick .
i &apos;ll be out of here on bail soon enough .
&quot; bail &quot; ? there &apos;s not gonna be any bail .
you &apos;re a flight risk .
given that the $ 5.5 million your brother @-@ in @-@ law gave you
is still unaccounted for .
what ? you didn &apos;t think we were gonna find out about that ?
your name &apos;s all over the halawa visitor &apos;s log ,
and don &apos;t tell me waincroft &apos;s helping you out
with an investigation because i looked into that as well .
mr. kelly , you went to him for money .
and in exchange ,
he was offered a private cell in the country club wing .
well , then you should know that that &apos;s only half the story .
a man named marco reyes
took danny williams &apos; brother .
i borrowed that money to help pay for that man &apos;s ransom .
and you didn &apos;t shave a little off the top ?
every penny went to the ransom .
mr. kelly ...
there &apos;s a lot of conflicting evidence regarding mr. reyes .
you &apos;re here being charged with helping facilitate his murder .
so you can understand why i &apos;m a little skeptical .
it &apos;s not about what you think .
it &apos;s the truth .
but then again , you were never really interested in the truth ,
were you ?
all you want is to see me behind bars .
that &apos;s where you belong , mr. kelly .
you took drug money from a cop killer .
no matter how it was used ,
that &apos;s still a crime .
a friend thought his brother was going to be murdered .
i did what i could to help save that man &apos;s life .
detective williams must be some kind of friend
if you &apos;re willing to throw away your career and freedom for him .
i mean , i don &apos;t know anyone who would do that for me .
what ? is something funny ?
just the thought of you having friends .
your friend killed a man ,
and you aided and abetted .
so i &apos;m thinking the only one
who should be smiling here
is me .
i just came from halawa .
gabriel waincroft isn &apos;t there .
where is he ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i think coughlin took him
and stashed him somewhere as a preemptive strike .
coughlin &apos;s no dummy .
he probably figured we &apos;d go to halawa
to see what waincroft told ia .
okay , we &apos;re gonna have to assume
that gabriel didn &apos;t tell coughlin
what chin was using the money for .
well , this bum &apos;s been in the system most of his life .
he knows the game .
he &apos;s holding onto the information .
withholding the truth to maybe make a another deal
in case coughlin doesn &apos;t bite .
okay , gabriel knows that my cousin &apos;s an easy target .
if he told ia that chin took the money for himself ,
coughlin &apos;s going to make sure
he loses his badge and for good .
18 and a half million dollars .
i have to imagine that was pretty heavy .
we got you with the bags coming and going ,
detective , so where &apos;s the money ?
the money , uh , would be right where we left it .
uh , st. joseph &apos;s casa de los ni ? os .
an orphanage ?
you must really love kids to leave them that kind of cash , huh ?
i mean ...
you offed a guy and ...
you and your accomplice ,
you could &apos;ve just , uh ,
you could &apos;ve just retired on that .
you &apos;re from boston ?
patriots .
bruins and red sox .
but that &apos;s hardly relevant .
right , no , i &apos;m just ,
i &apos;m just trying to figure out
why a guy who grew up
300 miles away from me
cares so much about a scumbag drug @-@ dealing murderer ,
uh , from south america .
i care about the law .
and you broke it .
it &apos;s really that simple .
marco reyes cut my brother up into pieces
and put him in an oil drum .
and you murdered him in cold blood .
you know , you know ,
mr. reyes had a family .
two young boys .
just about the same age as your daughter .
did you know that ?
you took the law in your own hands , detective .
out of all people , you should &apos;ve known better .
well , i guess i &apos;m gonna have to live with that , right ?
but what i , what i don &apos;t understand is why you are here .
why you are working this case .
like i said-- you broke the law .
it &apos;s really that simple .
no , no , no . i &apos;m a cop .
i &apos;ve been reading liars half my life .
it can &apos;t be that simple .
okay , well , you &apos;re gonna have a lot of time
on the plane to think it through .
oh , well , i already , um ,
i already thought it through a little bit .
tell me what you think . uh ...
reyes was on your payroll .
or the colombians ... or both , whatever .
and , um , whatever he was into is still in play
because now somebody wants payback .
not payback for his murder .
i &apos;m sure his mother didn &apos;t even care about that .
but , no , you need someone to take the fall , uh ,
because reyes expired
before you got what you wanted out of him .
am i ... close ? ballpark ?
i &apos;m gonna get you a book for the plane .
i sign that , what does my daughter find out ?
what does she hear ?
what she reads in the papers .
that &apos;s all .
and if she comes to visit you ,
that &apos;s on the colombians .
there is really no reason to make this any more complicated .
i &apos;m sorry , what does that mean ?
is that a threat ?
are you threatening me ?
you threatening my family ?
i don &apos;t understand .
don &apos;t be so shortsighted , detective .
sign the waiver ...
and then we &apos;re done .
ellie , what are you doing here ?
if anybody asks , this fell out of a truck .
steve , you should know the hearing &apos;s being held today .
an associate close to the judge just told me
danny &apos;s gonna waive extradition .
wait a minute--
he @-@ he &apos;s voluntarily surrendering to the colombians ?
why would he do that ?
i don &apos;t know . but as soon as the judge signs that order ,
danny &apos;s gone .
judge is ready .
hey ! hey , danny ! danny !
commander mcgarrett ?
i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to step back from the prisoner .
who are you ? huh ?
steve , it &apos;s okay .
no , it &apos;s not okay . this man has been denied counsel .
that &apos;s a violation of his civil rights , you understand that ?
uh , this man refused counsel , commander .
why would you do that , danny ?
what did you threaten him with ?
he @-@ he didn &apos;t threaten me .
steve , listen to me .
i signed the paper .
everything &apos;s okay .
just please talk to grace
and tell her i &apos;m okay
and that i &apos;m gonna call her soon as i can .
can you do that , please ?
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
you listen to me , listen to me .
i was there .
when marco reyes was murdered ,
i was in the room--
you understand ? you hearing me ?
if the colombians want danny ,
they want me , too .
yeah , well , then you &apos;re lucky
that your friend here is keeping you off their radar .
no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m not gonna let you do that .
you &apos;re not gonna sign an extradition to protect me .
what are you doing ?
you don &apos;t have a choice .
deal &apos;s been made .
call grace , huh ?
call gra ...
call grace , huh ?
promise me you &apos;ll talk to grace .
how &apos;s my brother @-@ in @-@ law ?
how do you think ?
well ,
i didn &apos;t tell him to come to me for money .
he did that all on his own .
yeah , about that money you gave him .
he told me every penny
went to buy back detective williams &apos; brother .
well , that sounds like a noble cause .
but i gave chin that money to move me out of general pop .
and for that , he got $ 5 million .
that &apos;s a lot of money for a change of scenery .
true .
but being the brother @-@ in @-@ law of a cop
didn &apos;t make me very popular in halawa .
so what it came down to was that money or my life .
and you &apos;ll testify to that ?
and see that hypocrite go to jail ?
absolutely .
but you &apos;re gonna need to sweeten the deal .
i &apos;m listening .
i want a sentence reduction .
you &apos;re a cop killer .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
then i guess you won &apos;t be getting chin ho kelly .
i can try to get you a commuted sentence .
submit a petition to the governor .
i have a better chance of winning the lottery .
how does minimum security sound ?
not good enough .
that &apos;s all i got .
i want that in writing .
i &apos;ll have it drawn up .
okay , so duke &apos;s standing by .
as soon as coughlin surfaces ,
we &apos;re gonna put a tail on him
and find out where he &apos;s holding gabriel .
duke &apos;s a good man .
yeah .
how you holding up ?
the truth ?
yeah .
i , um , i can &apos;t shake this feeling in my gut
that my cousin is gonna go to prison this time .
you know , after their last go @-@ around ,
coughlin &apos;s way too smart to go after chin
without knowing for sure that he has an airtight case .
the asset forfeiture team
from the state attorney general &apos;s office
already sealed up his house .
his property &apos;s being seized ...
he &apos;s losing everything
that he ever worked and fought for his entire life .
chin knew the risks when he was asking for that money .
he didn &apos;t care , &apos; cause danny was in trouble
and your cousin was there .
now we &apos;re gonna be there for him .
and if chin &apos;s gonna go down ,
he &apos;s not gonna go down without a fight .
i like the sound of that .
good .
come here .
he &apos;ll be all right .
thanks .
yeah .
steve ... i just heard from my contact .
it turns out that there was more to danny &apos;s arrest
than just bringing him to justice for the reyes murder .
what else could it have been about ?
it was an apology of sorts .
reyes was in the middle of a big deal
when he was killed on the cia &apos;s watch ,
and somebody has to answer for that .
how big a deal we talking about ?
$ 1.3 billion of cocaine never made it to market .
reyes was the only one who knew where that shipment was .
the cia &apos;s been looking for it ever since he was killed .
so this whole thing-- none of it , none of it
is about finding justice for reyes &apos; murder .
it &apos;s about the missing dope .
what the ... ?
what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing , commander ?
want to make a deal .
deal about what ?
danny &apos;s freedom for that shipment of cocaine
you &apos;ve been looking for .
yeah . you &apos;d better watch your driving .
we know where it is .
we know where it is , all right ?
but you , uh , you don &apos;t get to see it
until danny &apos;s been released
with paperwork exonerating him .
well , that &apos;s a nice offer , but he &apos;s gone .
what do you mean he &apos;s gone ?
i just took detective williams to the plane two hours ago .
he &apos;s on his way to bogotá ?
but you find that cocaine ,
and i can guarantee you that the colombian government
will , uh ... will approve that .
give me 48 hours .
done .
good luck .
we have no idea where that cocaine is .
no , we don &apos;t .
guy come in with a warrant , nothing i can do .
hey , i don &apos;t care what your warrant says ,
you got five seconds to leave this office .
you having a bad day , commander ?
five ...
you really gonna protect a crooked cop ?
four ...
you understand you are interfering with
an official investigation .
three ...
there will be consequences .
two ...
very well .
i already have what i need .
that stays here . that stays here .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not up to you .
i can read it to you if you like .
or not .
have a good evening , gentlemen .
stay focused .
guys , come on .
we &apos;ve been over all this stuff three times .
there &apos;s nothing in any of this stuff
that &apos;s gonna tell us where reyes hid three tons of cocaine .
if the national police can &apos;t find it in their raids ,
there &apos;s no way we &apos;re gonna do this
from 6,000 miles away without
kicking in some doors .
i mean , we can &apos;t just go down there without good intel .
in 39 hours , the clock stops .
okay , so the tail on coughlin just came through .
gabriel &apos;s being held in a safe house just outside hau &apos;ula .
i.a. &apos; s got it on lockdown .
we &apos;re not gonna be able to get to him
without it getting ugly .
doesn &apos;t matter . he &apos;s not gonna be there long anyway .
as soon as coughlin locks up his case against chin ,
gabriel &apos;s going right back inside .
all right .
no one person is more important than the other ,
but chin is here
and danny is a cop in a south american prison .
if we don &apos;t move fast , he &apos;s not gonna last the week .
i &apos;ll be back .
there &apos;s something i need to take care of , too , all right ?
where are you go ... ?
where is everybody going ?
where you going ?
danno !
they said he was arrested for murder .
it &apos;s a complicated situation .
is it true ? did he kill someone ?
who is it ?
was he bad ?
gracie , listen to me , all right ?
you have to believe in your father .
your dad , he &apos;s the best man i know ,
and everything he does ,
he does to protect the people he loves .
so , no matter what happens , you got to know that .
okay .
come here .
i promise you , kid ,
i promise i &apos;m gonna bring danno home , all right ?
okay .
i love you .
here &apos;s what i got from my contact .
this is an oil refinery owned by an old marco reyes front man .
someone that he grew up with and trusted completely .
so , why do we think the coke &apos;s there ?
steve , you said that reyes delivered
danny &apos;s brother &apos;s body in an oil drum ?
that &apos;s right . according to my contact ,
the cia did not know about matty until after he was murdered .
that got me thinking-- reyes had to have held him
in a place that his partners
and the government did not even know about .
okay , so there &apos;s security .
armed guards , 40 strong .
it &apos;s guerilla country .
maybe they &apos;re just protecting the refinery .
negative . that refinery &apos;s been offline for five years .
which begs the question :
why the security in a defunct facility ?
what is there that &apos;s worth protecting ?
how reliable is your contact ?
110 % .
okay . we got one shot at this .
if the intel &apos;s good , we got a chance of bringing danny home .
if it &apos;s not ,
we could all end up in a south american prison .
* i &apos;m ... *
* so in love with you *
* whatever you want me to *
* is all right with me *
* cause you make me feel *
* so brand @-@ new ... *
funky joe white and his musketeers .
frank .
thought you guys had stood me up .
what is this , frank ?
you said you needed transportation .
what &apos;s with you and salvage ?
kid , this is a perfectly good example of vintage aviation .
it &apos;s a washing machine with propellers .
big man , you &apos;re not exactly paying top dollar here .
in fact , you &apos;re not paying anything at all .
so if i were you ,
i &apos;d grab a double @-@ wide seat and keep a bag handy .
hang on a second .
i know this old hippie didn &apos;t just call me fat .
lou grover , meet frank bama .
best rotor @-@ head to get you in country .
yeah .
yep .
we &apos;re gonna need to
work on a little weight distribution with you .
he just did it again .
all right , let &apos;s get this bird in the air .
we got weather coming .
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;s gonna get done .
trust me .
the first one is free .
let me guess . second one &apos;s gonna cost me ?
the only way you going to survive in here ,
amigo , is if you pay .
understand ?
you give us money ,
you get to live .
you don &apos;t ...
i @-@ i ... i can get you money .
i just need to make a phone call , all right ?
of course .
whatever you need , amigo .
all right .
steve , i got radio contact with the ground
asking us to identify ourselves .
how far out are we ?
six klicks .
ignore it .
that &apos;s what i thought you &apos;d say .
guess they didn &apos;t like our answer .
contact ! spot your targets !
conserve your ammo !
go ahead .
make your phone call .
get us our money .
hello ?
hey , monkey , how are you ?
you all right ?
i love you very much .
danno , where are you ?
are you okay ?
of course i &apos;m okay .
i &apos;m always okay , huh ?
how are you ? i love you .
i love you , too , daddy .
but when are you coming home ?
i &apos;m gonna come home very soon , monkey .
right away . you hear me ?
you think this is a game ?
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a game . no .
we gave you a chance , and you blew it .
you like to make a dramatic entrance , don &apos;t you ?
yeah , well , uh , we found your coke .
where is it ?
well , it &apos;s gone .
what do you mean , &quot; gone &quot; ?
i mean , uh , we destroyed it .
you realize you just signed
your friend &apos;s death warrant , right ?
i don &apos;t think so . you see , at the same location ,
we didn &apos;t just find the drugs .
we found reyes &apos; books .
this , right here , is everything
to do with sandpiper .
including all the payoff accounts .
hey , see , marco reyes was , uh ,
he was paying money to a bunch of different people--
various colombian generals ,
politicians , government officials ...
... and one american .
you .
you never cared about justice ;
you never cared about the law .
all you wanted was your piece of the action .
you are meddling in international affairs , commander .
just shut up and listen .
this is what &apos;s gonna happen .
you &apos;re gonna have detective williams returned to u.s. soil
with all charges dropped .
and the second his plane touches down in oahu ,
you &apos;re gonna resign ,
you &apos;re gonna collect your pension ,
and then you &apos;re gonna disappear .
and if you don &apos;t ,
this gets released .
it &apos;s all there ,
just as we agreed .
all it needs is your signature .
lieutenant ...
sign here and you can go .
i don &apos;t understand . where &apos;s coughlin ?
cuz ...
kono , what &apos;s going on ?
coughlin &apos;s dead .
and gabriel &apos;s gone .
what ?
he killed coughlin and then he escaped .
you know , i &apos;m thinking that was his plan all along .
to get him to move him ,
trust him , and then strike .
but now ,
without coughlin or gabriel &apos;s testimony ,
there &apos;s no case against you .
thank you .
or you could say &quot; mahalo &quot; &quot;
i suppose i could .
still , huh ? after all these years , you still hate this place .
oh , no , buddy , i &apos;m still trying to figure out a way to like you .
okay ? forget this place .
fair enough .
let me ask you a question .
why didn &apos;t you lawyer up ?
why didn &apos;t you get a lawyer to fight this thing ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any lawyer
who could change what i did .
they ... they could get you off , danny .
look , i , uh , i &apos;ve been living with what i did ,
feeling a certain way about it
ever since i did it .
okay ? and maybe some crazy part of me
just didn &apos;t want to feel that way anymore .
you know ?
i guess .
but that does not mean that i am not
happy and grateful that i am here ,
so thank you , partner .
you &apos;re the one who was ready to go to jail
to keep me out of it .
i should be thanking you .
that &apos;s what family does , right ?
yeah .
danno .
speaking of which ... how do i look ?
you look great .
thanks .
danno .
danno .
i missed you .
i told you i was coming home .
we earned our trident today .
hooyah .
steve , i know you were surveilling me
while i was in quarantine .
and i can &apos;t say i blame you , but ...
this suspicion has to stop .
i need you to trust me .
all right . just give me a reason , joe .
well , i will , if you give me a chance .
all right .
good . i appreciate that .
you know , i &apos;d , uh ... i &apos;d still like to thank your contact .
i mean , whoever gave you that classified intel
on the refinery really put themself on the line .
who owes you , joe ?
it &apos;s not who owed me , steve , it &apos;s who owes you .
it was your mother .
that the real reason i wasn &apos;t arrested with danny ?
yes .
you &apos;re welcome .
