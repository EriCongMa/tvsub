oh , that feels so good .
oh , lucky me . coffee and a live sex show .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
nothing . i was just reading to emma .
from cosmo ?
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s :
&quot; climax your way to better skin . &quot;
so i have to go shopping today , which is my least favorite thing .
i &apos;m so bad at picking out clothes .
so you need someone who knows fashion to tell you what looks good .
not me . not me . not me .
oh , hey , rach ?
yeah ?
maybe you could take charlie shopping ?
oh , well ..
i &apos;m sure you have better things to do .
you kidding ?
rachel loves to shop , and she has great taste .
she &apos;s the one that taught me not to wear white after labor day ..
and to always , always , always put on underwear when trying on clothes .
if you have the time , i &apos;d really appreciate the help .
okay . yeah , let &apos;s shop .
okay , you are gonna come back with some very classy clothes .
and some slutty lingerie . slutty !
okay , great . all right , bye .
pain in the ass !
that &apos;s off , right ?
what &apos;s the matter , phoebe ?
mike &apos;s sister just invited me to a party tonight and he &apos;s gonna be there .
she was like , &quot; don &apos;t worry . i asked him and he &apos;s totally okay with seeing you . &quot;
so now i have to go so he &apos;ll think that i &apos;m totally okay with seeing him .
which you &apos;re not . you &apos;re hung up on him .
exactly .
you want him to eat his heart out , so you have to look fabulous .
i didn &apos;t even think about that .
sexual politics !
phoebe , i &apos;m taking charlie shopping .
come and i &apos;ll help you find something .
that &apos;d be great .
oh , isn &apos;t that nice ? the three of you , trying on slutty lingerie together .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re gonna do .
why &apos;d you ruin it ? who was i hurting ?
the.one.with.the.donor
fortunately , she has a very pretty face .
i still can &apos;t believe this . my uterus is an inhospitable environment ?
i &apos;ve always tried so hard to be a good hostess .
i can &apos;t believe my sperm have low motility .
while i was growing up , they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places .
hi there .
hi .
i &apos;m sorry there wasn &apos;t better news from your tests last week ..
but i wanted to talk to you about your options .
okay .
even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren &apos;t great ..
you never know , so keep having sex on a regular basis .
oh , damn it !
don &apos;t worry . after a while , you &apos;ll tune it out .
given your situation , the options with the greatest chances for success ..
would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor .
if you feel that neither of those is right for you , you could always adopt .
is that a hint ?
because we love you , dr. connelly , but we don &apos;t want you to be our child .
wow ! talk about an inhospitable environment .
hi . okay , you ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping ?
let &apos;s do it .
all right , have a good time .
not gonna find any clothes in there .
hey , you guys .
hi .
guess who &apos;s up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference ?
chris bailey ?
yeah , right .
when was the last time he made a submission deadline for an abstract ?
why are you laughing ?
just seeing what it &apos;d be like to be a paleontologist .
it &apos;s fun . yeah .
so you &apos;re up for keynote speaker ?
who &apos;s deciding ?
professor sherman .
i &apos;m meeting with him today .
he &apos;s a pretty tough guy to impress .
i think i know how to dazzle him .
you &apos;re not gonna to do a magic trick , are you ?
no .
hey , guys .
i want to ask you something .
i may get to speak at this paleontology convention .
if i do , i &apos;d love for you guys to come and hear me .
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues , work and / or are sick .
it &apos;s in barbados .
but you come first .
i &apos;m there .
i don &apos;t know ross , i &apos;m not feeling too ..
barbados is in the caribbean , joe .
why didn &apos;t anybody say so ?
see you later .
okay , bye .
bye . see you .
bye .
so how did it go at the fertility clinic ?
not as much fun as last time .
apparently , you only get porn if you &apos;re giving a sperm sample .
so , what did the doctor say ?
there &apos;s surrogacy , but monica &apos;s dreamt her whole life of carrying a child ..
and she just felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her .
so you &apos;re ruling out surrogacy ?
yeah .
so i don &apos;t have to learn what that means ?
aside from adoption , the only other choice is insemination ..
so we &apos;re talking about sperm donors .
enough said . i &apos;m there for you , man . where is she , upstairs ?
your long @-@ standing offer to have sex with my wife is appreciated .
but i think i &apos;ll pass .
so how do you feel about all this ?
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child , but there isn &apos;t one .
come on , ross , be a good guy . step up and do it .
what ?
what ? ! no ! i &apos;m not gonna give them ben !
the data we &apos;re receiving from mri scans and dna testing ..
of these fossils are staggering .
i mean , we &apos;ve been accepting leakey &apos;s dates as a given .
but if they &apos;re off by even a 100,000 years or so ..
then you can just throw most of our assumptions ..
you know , right in the trash .
so , what i &apos;m saying is ..
is that ..
is that repercussions could be huge .
i mean , not just in paleontology , but if you think about it ..
in evolutionary biology , genetics , geology .
i mean , truly , the mind boggles .
well , that &apos;s not what you want .
incentive for men ?
i &apos;ll take some of that .
phoebe , that &apos;s for men .
i know .
when i go to the party later ..
mike will know i &apos;m over him because i &apos;ll smell like another guy .
okay .
oh , good , i &apos;m dating a russian cabdriver .
seriously , does anyone buy this ? i smell like beets .
i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads in them . where are those ?
on melanie griffith in working girl .
i think what you want is over here .
see , i told you i needed someone .
by the way , as a thank you , i would really love to take you out .
really ?
joey and i are going to a movie tonight .
you want to come ?
oh , i can &apos;t .
because i &apos;ve seen them .
you &apos;ve seen all the movies ?
yeah . i &apos;m a big fan .
of the movies .
you know , motion pictures .
the talkies .
rach , will you come with me to a dressing room ?
sure .
okay .
maybe we could do something else .
you know , that depends on what it is . i &apos;ve done a lot of stuff .
so , what were you doing out there ? do you not like charlie ?
she &apos;s okay . i don &apos;t know , i just don &apos;t get a really good vibe from her .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
you know , just the way she waltzed in here all smart ..
and tall , you know ..
and just swept joey off his feet . nobody else has a chance .
who else ?
anybody .
you . me .
you know , monica &apos;s mom .
you like joey ? !
phoebe !
all right , look , i do . i have a little thing for him . just ..
oh , my god .
it &apos;s just physical .
i have it totally under control , okay ? it &apos;s just when i see them together ..
sometimes , i just get a little jealous .
wow . isn &apos;t that ironic that he liked you , and now you like .. ?
i get it !
all right , as long as it &apos;s under control .
you can &apos;t do anything about it . he &apos;s already dating her .
she is a nice person . that wouldn &apos;t be right .
i know , i know . so it &apos;s just not a big deal .
so can we keep this between us ?
sure .
great , because i gotta get out of here . the smell of beets is killing me .
any chance charlie has a deaf twin ?
hi , honey .
hey .
i brought a friend home for dinner . this is zack from work .
oh , of course . it &apos;s so nice to see you again , zack .
you too .
you guys haven &apos;t actually met before .
but , boy , you &apos;re both polite .
have a seat . i &apos;ll get you a beer .
i got it .
thanks .
so zack &apos;s pretty nice , huh ?
yeah , i guess .
so how would you like to have a baby that &apos;s half yours and half his ?
excuse me ?
we &apos;re talking about sperm donors , and zack may be the guy .
look . he &apos;s intelligent , he &apos;s healthy , he &apos;s athletic . i mean , he &apos;s sperm @-@ tastic !
chandler , this is crazy . well , what did you even say to him ?
&quot; come up . meet my wife . give us your sperm . &quot;
i invited him to dinner so you &apos;d get a chance to get to know him .
with a sperm bank , you never meet the guy , get to check him out .
chandler !
i &apos;m telling you , he &apos;s great .
i mean , even if my sperm worked fine , i think he &apos;d be the way to go .
i &apos;m not going to be a part of this .
you can &apos;t bring some random guy home and expect him to be our sperm donor .
okay .
zack ?
thanks .
do you have a coaster ? i don &apos;t want to make a ring .
tell me about yourself , zack .
oh , god , do you think she heard ? it &apos;d be so bad if she heard .
maybe she didn &apos;t hear . i &apos;ll go into that dressing room and talk . you stay here .
see if you can hear me .
okay , great .
oh , thank god , i can &apos;t hear a word that you &apos;re saying .
i didn &apos;t say anything yet .
well , get back in there and talk .
i &apos;m rachel .
it &apos;s so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends .
what ?
well , some things are just hard to say to your face .
okay , well , i heard that . which means that she heard it too .
we have a problem .
oh , what are we gonna do ?
just be honest with her .
oh , my god !
it is annoying when parents put babies on the phone .
all right , enough out of you !
thank you .
where did i go wrong ? this is good stuff .
hello ?
i need to talk to charlie . is she there ?
no , she went shopping with rachel . why ? what &apos;s up ?
i &apos;m meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker .
how &apos;s it going ?
it could be better .
he fell asleep .
what ? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda !
barbados .
fine , i &apos;ll rent a car and drive .
you have to get that job .
what am i supposed to do ? he &apos;s out cold .
in fact , he was just talking in his sleep before ..
and evidently he wants someone named fran to &quot; spank him harder . &quot;
well , just wake him up .
i can &apos;t .
if he realizes that i &apos;m the one who put him to sleep , i won &apos;t get the job .
that &apos;s a tough one .
oh , wait a minute . this happened to me before .
yeah , i was auditioning for a play , and the producer fell asleep . i ..
no , wait a minute .
it was me who fell asleep .
i mean , hey , shakespeare , how about a chase scene once in a while ?
hey , guys , dinner &apos;s ready .
i &apos;m gonna go wash up first .
thanks .
what do you think ? i want his genes for my kid . those eyes , those cheekbones .
okay , there &apos;s enthusiastic , and there &apos;s just plain gay .
you don &apos;t like him .
i think he &apos;s fine .
but we don &apos;t know anything real about him .
i wish we could get more information .
all right , just follow my lead .
you guys have a great place here .
thanks . i &apos;m crazy about our place .
hey , speaking of crazy ..
do you have a history of mental illness in the family ?
no . although , i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis .
that &apos;s really not the kind of thing we &apos;re looking for .
okay .
so tell me , how &apos;d you guys meet ?
oh , friends first , drunk in london , you know the story .
i &apos;ve got a better question for you :
do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes ?
no .
heart disease ? alzheimer &apos;s ? gout ?
you guys don &apos;t have people for dinner a lot , huh ?
we &apos;re just making conversation .
yeah , well , okay . i heard a joke today . it &apos;s pretty funny .
you know what &apos;s not funny ? male pattern baldness .
you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight , and i &apos;m flattered ..
and quite frankly , a little frightened .
can we just talk about something else ?
sure .
all right .
this ravioli &apos;s delicious .
i notice you &apos;re enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth .
did you have braces as a child ?
no , i didn &apos;t .
yes !
we &apos;re teeth people , zack .
let &apos;s just do it . let &apos;s just go over there and see if she heard .
good plan .
okay .
what ? where are you going ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , rachel .
i don &apos;t have time for your childish games , okay ?
i still have to find something incredible to wear ..
so i can beat mike at &quot; who &apos;s more over who &quot; !
where have you been ?
trying on clothes .
oh , really ? in the dressing room ? well , that &apos;s so weird .
phoebe and i were in the dressing room . gosh , it &apos;s just such a small world .
rachel , i heard you two guys whispering .
oh , god , you did , you heard . okay , look , let me explain .
there &apos;s nothing to explain . i heard you .
phoebe likes joey .
yeah .
i don &apos;t understand it . i mean , phoebe likes joey ..
and then she &apos;s here to buy a dress to impress another guy ?
yeah , that &apos;s phoebe . that &apos;s phoebe . you know , she just wants them all .
it &apos;s , like , she &apos;s nympho .
wow !
yeah .
you know , by the way , i heard you tell her not to do anything .
thanks for sticking up for me . god , you are such a nice person .
i try .
oh , my god , you really want me to be the keynote speaker ?
thank you !
you &apos;re welcome .
wow ! you look ..
stop @-@ eating hot !
which is like the highest level of hotness .
okay , are you sure ? because i am really dreading going to this party .
then don &apos;t go .
mike knows i &apos;m coming . if i don &apos;t show up , he &apos;ll think it &apos;s because of him ..
and then i &apos;m gonna lose face . that &apos;s a very serious thing in my culture .
all right , then you go to that party , and you pretend to be over mike .
afterward , you come to my place and i &apos;ll get you good and drunk .
you got it . okay .
but not on the wine that you made , okay ?
because i just don &apos;t want to go back to the emergency room .
i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t seem to have enough cash .
you would accept rubles , would you ?
this is a hundred @-@ thousand @-@ ruble note , which is worth approximately ..
nothing .
david ?
phoebe ! hi .
oh , my god !
hi .
wow ! you look unbelievable .
oh , yeah , well ..
what are you doing here ?
well , i &apos;m back from minsk . permanently .
well , what happened ?
remember how i was trying to achieve ..
the positronic distillation of subatomic particles ?
yeah .
well , after eight years of research , i discovered ..
that it can &apos;t be done .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s all right .
this kind of thing happens all the time in science .
to people who base eight years of research on a typo in a scientific journal .
well ..
great that you &apos;re back . how are you ?
good . good . life is good .
good .
well , i &apos;m seeing someone .
good for you .
yeah .
she &apos;s also a scientist , so she &apos;s very smart and pretty and ..
it &apos;s actually because of you that we &apos;re together .
i mean , i saw what you had with that mike guy ..
and i just said , &quot; boy , i want that . &quot;
mike and i broke up .
you &apos;re kidding me .
because i &apos;m not seeing anybody . i just totally made that up .
really ?
i don &apos;t know why , i &apos;m sorry .
i guess i just didn &apos;t want to lose face .
i understand .
yeah . okay . so then , okay ..
so we &apos;re both living in new york , not seeing anyone .
that &apos;s so not like us .
yeah , i know .
well , this is probably a stupid question , seeing that you look like that ..
but do you have someplace that you need to be right now ?
well ..
no .
well , do you want to get a drink ?
i &apos;d love to .
great .
okay .
do you smell beets ?
all right , stay upwind of me .
hey , there &apos;s phoebe . is that mike she &apos;s with ?
no , that &apos;s david .
there &apos;s a third guy ?
tip of the iceberg .
i &apos;m gonna take off now .
you &apos;re gonna let me go home , aren &apos;t you ?
sure you don &apos;t want to stay a little longer ?
no , i should get home . i &apos;m kind of tired .
are you always tired ?
because that could be a sign of clinical depression .
no , it &apos;s tiring to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died .
i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
okay .
bye .
i think we found our sperm .
he does seem pretty perfect .
yeah ? you think so ? should i ask him ?
no .
why not ? just because his great @-@ grandmother was obese ?
our kid &apos;s gonna get that from you anyway .
no , that &apos;s not it .
it &apos;s just that when we were asking him all those questions before ..
i just realized i don &apos;t care if he is the most perfect guy in the world .
he &apos;s not you .
yeah , he &apos;s better !
no , he &apos;s not .
if i can &apos;t get pregnant with you , then i don &apos;t want to get pregnant by him ..
or anyone else .
really ? are you sure ?
yeah , i &apos;m sure .
thank god , because l don &apos;t wanna do this either .
i was just doing it because i thought that was what you wanted .
i &apos;m the husband . i &apos;m supposed to bring the sperm .
that is so sweet .
i love you .
so you know this leaves us with ..
adoption .
how do you feel about that ?
i think i feel okay about it .
actually , i think i feel really good about it .
me too .
i wanna find a baby that needs a home , and i wanna raise it with you .
and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way .
so this is it ? we &apos;re really gonna adopt ?
yeah .
oh , my god ! we &apos;re gonna be parents !
we are gonna be great parents .
and it could be soon .
i mean , think about it . right now , somewhere out there ..
our baby could be being conceived .
wait . if we &apos;re lucky , and we &apos;re really , really , really quiet ..
we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking .
hey , zack .
hey , chandler .
i wanted to apologize for last night .
i got the feeling we made you uncomfortable .
no , you didn &apos;t .
really ?
no , you did .
my wife and i have some boundary issues .
sometimes we ask inappropriate questions .
we &apos;re working on it .
here are the boards for friday &apos;s pitch .
thank you .
