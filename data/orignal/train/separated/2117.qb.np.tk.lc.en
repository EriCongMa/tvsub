42 @-@ 30 . copy that .

on a fence released from prison six months ago .
angela was bumped from the flight
angela probably set mary up ,
angela &apos;s going to be killed .
if i don &apos;t do exactly what he says .
where &apos;s angela ?
angela faked her own kidnapping ?
the good news is that angela &apos;s safe as long as they believe
august march . hpd .
august march ?
nothing moved on or off honolulu
august march ran one of the largest smuggling networks
okay , uh , chin , what about the origin of the diamonds ?
danny , it &apos;s not a bike path .
danny , call kono , have her pick mary up
hey , i &apos;ve been thinking about these diamonds .
jordan nevins .
all the outbound calls
okay , kono , tell me something good .
okay , kono , get the governor on the phone .
march was telling me he thinks
mary , this happens to all of us .
mary , we need to determine
mary &apos;s been arrested .
30 minutes before mary was arrested .
mary &apos;s not a smuggler .
mary didn &apos;t make that plane .
had to have been a part of the smuggler &apos;s operation .
that mary and the diamonds are on that plane .
commander mcgarrett , your sister
commander mcgarrett .
mr. march .
steve , if i &apos;m not on that plane in nine hours with the diamonds ,
steve , i really screwed up .
no , i &apos;m good , thank you .
ah , that &apos;s good to keep in mind .
it is , it &apos;s true .
all right , well , what @-@ what now ?
per the watch commander ,
i &apos;m gonna break every single bone in your body , okay ?
put him back in his cage .
give him to me . just give him to me . no !
okay , okay ! would you slow down , please ?
dressed as a flight attendant .
just helping his brother ?
the kidnapper &apos;s accent . exactly .
had about $ 20 million worth of diamonds
in the protective custody wing , right ?
sorry to disappoint you ,
that she got arrested two months ago
got sidetracked by this case .
maybe an overfriendly passenger ?
better than i hoped .
and nobody must know about my involvement .
pretty sweet . right ?
just the players do .
never turn your back on the buyer .
now don &apos;t be fooled by the way he looks .
no kidding .
and stop over analyzing things .
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not behind this .
don &apos;t show much .
but tell her i want it done low @-@ key .
and how you ended up with these diamonds .
and now he &apos;s on the fbi most wanted list .
a room key , and nobody saw her with another woman .
he had an accent .
struggle , or a girl named angela .
no . nobody .
no , i didn &apos;t run background
out of the blue like that ? no .
very good . okay , and if we can flip him ,
not five @-@ o &apos;s .
but nothing as large as this .
but it &apos;s all good stuff , so don &apos;t worry .
but there &apos;s one more thing you need to learn
but with your help , this actually worked out
but since you &apos;ve killed
sorry , brah .
lay eyes on me again .
but it &apos;s just rolling straight to voicemail whenever we try it .
the minute you got away from him ?
no ...
don &apos;t ya ? huh ?
that &apos;s not going to happen , mary .
wasn &apos;t european , but similar .
no , i &apos;ll get your ve ... uh , chin ?
sorry . maybe i just don &apos;t get it .
doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s not dirty .
guess you could call it that .
in , like , three days .
okay ,
a conflict diamond .
for me to prepare a press release
with the exception
you learn from your mistakes .
from jail ? why ? what does he get out of it ?
you stopped being one 30 years ago .
the guy who called in the anonymous tip on mary .
listen , whoever made the call to tsa about mary
excuse me .
stop . push in .
no , you &apos;re wrong , okay ?
well , most people like to start the day off
just remember , we wait for him to inspect the diamonds .
it was reported stolen last night .
but if they were always gonna steal the diamonds ,
but ...
but ...
but maybe kono got a chance to enhance that video ,
but please stop driving this car
but if i help you ,
but she never actually checked in .
but he knew everything about me .
but there were plenty of cops
but he said he wanted to fence ...
but the part of the puzzle we don &apos;t have is how they know
but then we figured what &apos;s the use ?
but i did confirm that mary has a co @-@ worker
but it doesn &apos;t ... it doesn &apos;t make sense to me .
but with what you &apos;ve been handling lately ,
right ? -- and he lied to me ,
until then , i &apos;m going on the assumption
when the guy there approaches her and takes possession
when you meet your new cell mate ,
when you drop in on someone &apos;s wave ,
&quot; when you land , walk directly to baggage carousel three .
yes ! it &apos;s the coolest job ever .
yeah .
all right , well , i &apos;m gonna charge you
okay .
come on . seriously .
of the evidence van hijacker , okay ?
on the coffee . -well , wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait a minute . you ran background on my sister ?
wait , you can &apos;t do that .
excuse me . come on , vince .
number two : i clearly told the guy
on your sister ; tsa did ,
the product to a buyer at a specific date and time .
either missing or stolen .
you understand me ? you understand me ?
be referred to as a pupu .
all of the diamonds like i told you .
that are on the island
what does it say ?
right ? that &apos;s the only way that they would have known
i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t do that anymore .
i said , &quot; hey , buddy , i &apos;m on the wave ! &quot;
this is the first time for the both of us .
with the death of those two cops .
thank you .
well , as i told you on the phone ,
eh , don &apos;t worry .
for the murder of your ex @-@ partner . i know who he is .
but not the new chief of detectives , huh ?
and according to the hotel records ,
and besides , this guy matches the description
and unlike you guys ,
and he told me that angela &apos;s dead
and he told me that he &apos;s going to text his partner ,
battle training , anyway .
and she knew i need a job , so here i am .
relax , kid .
yeah , really .
plane lands in new york in less than four hours .
relax ? that &apos;s funny coming from you .
to make a big score .
just confirmed he &apos;s staying in the penthouse suite .
of carbon formed at high pressure
what was that ?
announcing the seizure of 20 million in conflict diamonds .
and tell them we need those diamonds here immediately .
he told him the description of the van ,
and tell me how you got away from this guy
that tells me that if that press release hits ,
i have something i have to show you , if you got a minute .
she &apos;s on every country &apos;s watch list .
gives us enough-- more than enough--
can &apos;t trace it .
you finish making that call ...
about this type of business .
i checked through interpol .
come on over here a second .
whatever crimes i committed in the past are just that .
the past !
so , what was the plan ?
hey !
hey .
the airline gave us her cell phone number ,
just so there &apos;s no confusion , this is hpd &apos;s handle ,
okay , well , holding back the fact
listen , mary , just take a deep breath ,
okay , but you do know people
okay , what ?
okay , all right , good . take mr. march over to fong &apos;s ,
fine . fine , fine , fine .
fine , fine , fine .
okay , well , can you describe this guy to me ?
all right , what are you getting at ?
all right , well , good . that &apos;s a good start .
okay .
okay .
well ...
okay , no , no , no . do what you want to do . be paranoid .
okay , well , i @-@ i think that the same rules
all right , so if you &apos;re gonna start looking for the hijacker ,
okay , maybe , maybe .
well , if she &apos;d been kidnapped ,
yeah , well , i certainly
okay , we don &apos;t know who made the call ,
okay , well , it doesn &apos;t mean it didn &apos;t happen
okay , who &apos;s this one to ?
all right .
okay .
okay .
okay .
yeah . he was tall .
okay .
all right , when you get those diamonds ,
okay , listen ... officer : detective kelly ?
okay , that &apos;s good . how ?
okay . do we have a positive i.d. ?
okay , if they stole the semi truck last night ,
all right , where &apos;s angela ?
okay , go nuts . let your mind
okay , no problem .
okay , you said you stopped her based on a tip .
okay , all right , this is crazy .
okay , well ,
okay .
you pick yourself up .
okay .
all right , so he brings angela down the back way
all right .
all right , that &apos;s number one .
nice shot , fryer .
good news is , they still have no idea
why bother lying ?
you &apos;re gonna feel safer in here with us
and she doesn &apos;t exist , right ?
in the same condition as when your sister checked out .
a little closer to my sister than you were
black helicopters are real .
okay . you know , williams ...
hey , you okay ?
hey , look , you &apos;re not done . you &apos;re not .
hey , look , he &apos;s capable of killing cops .
hey . hey , look ,
hey ... dead man walking .
guys , listen , i think
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m delighted you reached out to me , angela .
surprise .
babbling about black helicopters .
here we go .
are tossing my place or did you just miss me ?
and they got a bullet for it .
okay , and why would you not call me
and she &apos;s the one that helped me get this job .
that are in that business , correct ?
it &apos;s butter cream .
won &apos;t answer your questions ...
brings too much heat .
bribe a judge ? what ?
either way , you &apos;re gonna answer my questions , because ...
from the tsa &apos;s custody , and drop her in my office ,
we met a few months back at this yoga club in new york .
if they are still on the island .
plan-- but what if , what if we get mary
if these guys just came in possession
seen him before ? yes , i &apos;m positive .
you weren &apos;t home , so i figured
see detective williams for an evidence transfer .
call that guy back .
and is that unusual-- to get a call
she helped me get this job .
she just didn &apos;t want to get killed doing it .
she is not on the plane , so , we &apos;re gonna have a big problem
she won &apos;t talk to anyone else .
that she &apos;s telling me the truth .
she reached out to him with an opportunity
how did she hook up with darryl ?
she &apos;s not smart enough
she &apos;s gonna try to fence those diamonds .
where she lands ,
she refused to talk to us .
the guy could have used the pass key . yeah , well ,
she &apos;s his ex @-@ old lady .
she &apos;s based out of new york and isn &apos;t due
did she say why she had the diamonds ?
and when she does , interpol and the fbi
she &apos;s in the wind .
you guys all stopped talking
earlier today , we got a tip
move in !
going in or out of that specific room .
surprise !
what the hell happened ?
he &apos;s not doing so good . he &apos;s dead .
we parted ways .
then we can roll back and arrest whoever &apos;s holding angela .
by yourself , right ?
that &apos;s the guy mary described .
that &apos;s the guy that kidnapped angela .
we work together as flight attendants .
is you and me are gonna get rich .
so ... so , you guys are , like , surf buddies now , huh ?
so we are kind of surf buddies now ?
about the liberian smuggling operation in the first place .
they &apos;re real .
that i &apos;m not that easy to surprise .
now ! move out !
we met at yoga class , like , three months ago .
as i said before ...
serving his sentence six months ago .
are gonna be waiting for her .
while we &apos;re on the subject ,
at the airport ?
based on quality ,
he &apos;s definitely surprised .
please slow down . i &apos;m asking you nicely .
with some pleasantries ,
should never , never , under any circumstances ,
look at him .
it looks like he didn &apos;t lie on his tsa entry form .
it looks like you &apos;re , uh ,
that look familiar ?
yeah , looks like we got about five hours till they find out .
look what we got here .
cuff him .
this could be from the people that have angela .
it was probably a prepaid cell anyway .
maybe just not telling us the full story .
to scare her into doing it .
and there &apos;s no death penalty here in hawaii .
come here .
come on . that &apos;s a young man &apos;s game .
comes from africa .
bargaining chip for angela &apos;s life . all right .
okay , and calm down , all right ?
the republic of liberia .
two more cops ,
maybe a little of both .
pick up your board , danny .
that makes zero sense .
yeah , that was my father . yeah .
yes .
nobody said you were dumb .
you got it .
i didn &apos;t know your sister was in town .
nothing . no parole .
no . don &apos;t think so .
no , no .
that mary and the diamonds didn &apos;t make that flight .
there &apos;s no reports of any diamond shipments this size ,
maybe she met somebody who was .
every diamond has a distinct marking .
tsa security line .
named angela branson who flew in with her .
you understand ?
well , so far , we have no signs of a forced entry ,
getting my vest .
that guy pulls out that gun ,
where &apos;s the girl ?
the other girl was my sister .
that would make sense , right ?
they already knew the diamonds were going to be seized today .
all right , see you later . -okay .
so , was there anyone new
so a stewardess .
so we &apos;ll catch up next time .
in the next half an hour , we can beat that plane to new york .
let &apos;s make &apos; em worry about us .
that is when we move in . darryl : you sure you can
that &apos;s the arrest signal .
i tried to offer him ...
it &apos;s usually a rival group trying
okay , look , we &apos;re going to check that hotel room ,
who knew the diamonds were in that van were cops .
move this kind of weight ?
what about the , uh , facial recognition thingie ?
uh , yeah , kind of .
all right , listen , as a professional courtesy ,
well , you &apos;ll be happy to know
well , then that would explain
wow .
of the product . y @-@ you did bring
you &apos;ve been played .
you &apos;ve got to give me your word
you didn &apos;t really think i &apos;d be dumb enough
you just got here .
you were gonna use
you gotta protect me
you start with hpd .
there &apos;s something about your body language right now
that was your birthday cake .
what do you mean ?
the moves you &apos;ve been making ,
your diamonds .
you know , it &apos;s funny ,
your share of the dough to make an appeal ?
maybe you should talk to my attorney about what my rights are ..
what you just said , coupled with the phone records
you give me the guys
any relation ?
hello , mary .
to your brother . okay , so then you know she was arrested
you and my sister mary did .
you are going to be wearing a tinfoil hat ,
that either you or angela had met ?
... you will never , never
why don &apos;t you just take it easy ?
you have lost your right to be housed in protective custody .
you can &apos;t own a wave .
is this how you arranged the transport van &apos;s hijacking ?
you cause problems for other surfers .
you could &apos;ve handpicked the best one . i didn &apos;t .
you two have
is there a reason you two
if you two are done draining each other emotionally ,
you don &apos;t think so ? no , i @-@ i know so .
you okay ? yeah .
your friend before this ? yes .
there you guys are .
you guys have been acting weird .
what were you guys talking about ?
when i came in the office this morning ?
what are you talking about ?
you seized some diamonds ?
people like you get killed .
you understand ? like , i &apos;m trying to put this thing together ,
you @-@ you can &apos;t ...
that you lost their diamond shipment .
are you sure ? things change .
are you sure you have the right person ?
you &apos;re making the waiter nervous .
you &apos;ve kept me waiting .
how long have you known angela ?
you think that he just orchestrated this whole thing ?
you planted that . it ain &apos;t mine .
you &apos;re positive you &apos;ve never
have you tried next door ?
you &apos;re the first to get shot .
it &apos;s a very colorful , but less @-@ than @-@ accurate description
you say you &apos;re not dumb ,
what are you talking about-- &quot; charade &quot; ?
what do you mean , they &apos;re real ?
why don &apos;t you pull it back a little bit ?
why do you keep asking me that ?
you sensitive right now ?
you &apos;re working for the airlines ?
you &apos;re going straight back to jail .
did i hear right , that your name &apos;s mcgarrett ?
your brother ...
you got new leverage on him ?
i &apos;ll be a dead man if you send me back to liberia .
you ever mention my daughter again ...
are you , uh ... are you staying in town
you already know that ,
you should be walking the main line
that you &apos;ll never bother me again .
you got a kid , right ?
have you ever done business with people from liberia ?
you lie to me again ,
are you implying that he &apos;s involved with this ?
what are you doing ?
is this a joke ?
than you are out there on the street .
what are you doing here , mary ?
how &apos;d you know about the cops ?
have you ever seen this guy before ?
you know , last time i saw you ...
you know , last time i checked ,
did you know ?
... you do know that the only people
you do know that that
going to a halloween party
the people in new york the diamonds were on the flight .
oh , okay .
whoa , whoa , whoa !
whoa , whoa !
oh , believe me , the pleasure &apos;s all mine .
he had dark skin .
cha cha cha
cha cha cha
well , you should never surprise a man
ex @-@ cop .
he robbed a transport van , killed two cops .
okay , are you trying to convince us or yourself ?
please ! we &apos;re not gonna be able to help anybody
be my guest .
no offense , but i think i &apos;m
take a seat .
that mary had the diamonds on her .
in the world .
and a promise of no deportation .
and afterwards , i can tell your bosses
and your brother turned to you for advice ?
and there was a man in my room with a gun .
which leads me to believe that is is probably ...
let me guess , you had already told
i &apos;m starting to think you are .
who transported me to jail 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not extensive .
without august march taking a piece of the action .
and feel free to call on me anytime .
that i care to recognize .
if march gets compromised ,
if anybody else wants to ride it with me , they &apos;re welcome .
because if not , anything happens ,
if there really isn angela . danny , she &apos;s my sister .
and if that doesn &apos;t happen ...
if i &apos;m not on that plane
if you lay a finger on me ,
you needed a man &apos;s invitation
if i could look at this stone
if i tell you everything ,
if somebody &apos;s on the wave first , they own the wave .
if there &apos;s a deal this big going down ,
30 years ... well ,
that killed my men ...
what was what ?
yeah .
life is going to get very interesting .
birthdayoy . happy birthday , buddy .
what do you mean ? well , the kidnappers said
the diamond ? !
all right , well , the rest of the security videos
for a while ? -actually , no .
i did , actually . can i have a cup of coffee , too ?
small world . how &apos;s he doing ?
can &apos;t blame a guy for trying .
well , it &apos;s working .
i know , but i have to go back to the hotel
yeah . and it tells a whole lot .
yeah . like usual , you figured out a way to ruin everything .
i know , but i thought she was my friend .
yeah , little bit .
it is , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , i finally felt like
who would &apos;ve taken that money , right , chief ?
isn &apos;t that true ?
yeah , but these guys killed two cops to get these stones ,
yeah , uh ...
okay , that &apos;s him .
yes . do you know anything about it ?
yeah , i do ,
right , and as far as brokers go , there &apos;s only
yeah .
in a good way .
in a good way .
around him
yeah ?
so what &apos;s the brokerage fee on 20 million worth ?
how exactly did that happen ?
knows who &apos;s responsible , okay ?
that &apos;s him .
from a stranger .
uh , well , my friend angela worked for the airlines ,
cell phone .
who gave it to you ? - it was an anonymous tip .
all right , who would have known something about that ?
who may have targeted you to smuggle those diamonds .
whoever sent you to me knows that . good .
okay , who &apos;s angela ?
and , by the way , we like
how &apos;s she doing , anyway ?
he had a deep voice .
i honestly don &apos;t even know what to do with myself .
why are you really here ? i know you &apos;re looking for something .
all clear .
well , i hate to be the one that states the obvious .
okay.i saw a wave , i rode it .
and that &apos;s why , if i were you ,
so , yeah , i think we got the right person .
so , this guy &apos;s been off the radar since he finished
so kaleo made the call that got mary arrested
therefore was not raised with all the mumbo jumbo .
back to new york , so i got to take a rain check
so tell me ...
so no one can see him .
the route , so they could hijack it .
so here i am .
that &apos;s why we called you .
and we are here to prove that-- that &apos;s what we &apos;re gonna do .
so there &apos;s no actual footage of anyone
so when the diamonds didn &apos;t get there ,
off of kaleo &apos;s cell phone are to his brother darryl ...
the overall quality
he taped the diamonds to me ,
he &apos;s in a life term .
he &apos;s strapped . butt of a gun sticking out of his shirt .
continued long after he was in prison
his name &apos;s darryl kaleo .
all right ? this guy &apos;s done his time .
for ordering the murder of two of his business associates .
he &apos;s easy to find .
he was the fence for stolen art and gems .
he can identify where the diamonds are from .
they take me at my word when i say i &apos;m out .
they had to , uh ,
they only have coverage of the stairwell ,
than they were of us .
so they know we &apos;re watching everyone leaving the island .
they said salt cake , i said , &quot; what &apos;s the plan ? &quot;
and they gave me the oahu to new york run .
of 20 million in ice , they need to move it through a broker .
they know you &apos;re a victim in all this .
hey , they just ran the plate on that semi .
they made the mistake of trusting him ,
he &apos;ll do fine .
he landed on the island three days ago .
he was a good man .
the man is a cold @-@ blooded killer .
he &apos;s dead .
he did that to keep you scared and cooperating , you understand ?
he &apos;s also in prison . that &apos;s right .
he &apos;ll have heard about it .
he was in my room waiting .
he took a picture of me on his cell phone ,
so cute .
and high temperature conditions .
you understand ?
listen to me . i thought i knew my brother--
take it from me , someone who was not born on this island ,
look , angela &apos;s gonna resurface eventually .
listen , kaleo ,
hey , look , no way in hell .
listen , um , ...
listen , there &apos;s a woman whose life is in danger .
look ,
we can hang out during my layovers .
on smuggling some contraband
like it &apos;s stolen , and slow down !
wow . here you go ,
you move on .
and used to finance civil wars
for angela &apos;s safety , we can &apos;t let anybody know
why &apos;d they just , uh ...
why &apos;d they run out of here so quick ?
why didn &apos;t you call me ?
why wouldn &apos;t they just snatch mary when she arrived
why &apos;s that ? killing cops ?
why these diamonds were never reported missing .
to get this girl back safe .
on one of the unrecorded lines
hey ! where &apos;s angela ?
hey , look at the time stamp .
hey , hey !
hey . so the room hasn &apos;t been serviced , so it should be
hey .
hey .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know ...
i could &apos;ve picked you up from the airport .
i &apos;m not worried . i &apos;m really happy for you .
i don &apos;t ... maybe . just tell me again .
i &apos;m not just talking about you .
i can &apos;t believe
i &apos;m not in that business anymore .
i don &apos;t know who he is , nor who referred him to me .
i broke a couple of bones in your face , right ?
i was planning on taking it by the office .
of course , i believe you . mary , just slow down .
&apos;cause i was terrified .
and that when i land ,
i &apos;m gonna need that diamond back .
i &apos;d check your favorite little surf spot .
my father wasn &apos;t that kind of cop .
the murder of my two cops trumps it-- come on .
oh , my god .
which means we got
butter cream &apos;s my favorite .
i &apos;m sure your prints are gonna be all over it .
i &apos;ll bet my job none of my guys are involved .
i would say ...
i told your partner i was too old for this .
i spoke to the airline .
i will play along .
i doubt if angela would ... double @-@ cross me .
i went straight to my hotel when i left you guys ,
i told you about her , didn &apos;t i ?
i &apos;d like to speak to my sister in private .
it &apos;s been a pleasure .
i would check out liberians here on temporary visas .
&quot; i &apos;ll be watching , so don &apos;t try and involve the cops ,
i was gonna get a text message from his guy in new york .
i &apos;ve been on ice for 30 years .
all right , i &apos;m not holding nothing back , mcgarrett .
i will have the consulate crawling so far up your ...
i &apos;m a facilitator .
i just figured a way for her and my brother to get rich .
i will also remember that .
i got a visual , 10 : 00 . right now . 10 : 00 .
i got him .
what does it look like i &apos;m doing here ?
i might .
it is ?
i &apos;m here for one piece of business .
i started like two weeks ago ,
i &apos;ll be right there .
i &apos;m working the return flight
i don &apos;t have time for your games . - no , no .
i didn &apos;t have many options .
i &apos;m not saying she &apos;s lying ,
i didn &apos;t get away .
we were gonna jump out and yell surprise ,
we need to talk .
we have a microscope for you to look at , okay ?
we need to get a look at this security film .
we got any , uh ... got any other contact info ?
nine hours to save your friend .
then we &apos;re going to know more .
we get anonymous tips about drug mules all the time .
and we will get an i.d. on her kidnapper .
i mean , people we think we can trust tell us lies .
we can use them as a
we didn &apos;t have a choice .
we tried to trace it , but he hung up too fast .

we should just face the fact ,
but we got footage of angela
after our little charade at the hotel ,

all we &apos;re trying to do is prevent
with the smuggler that we &apos;re looking for , okay ?
we know that you helped set this thing up ,
i &apos;m in this mess now .

i mean ... now , look , i just did what i had to do , all right ?
i said please don &apos;t do it , please ...
for all i know ,
i &apos;m too old for that kind of thing . come on .
i agree .
for not believing mary &apos;s story ,
i wish i could help you more .
i ... i liked that job .

i &apos;ve already been briefed on the kidnapping case .
my prior law enforcement work makes me a target .

i &apos;ve got 200 more of that same quality .
i got plan-- it might be a goofy
i got the connections .
or i &apos;m gonna file a complaint !
i &apos;m a student of the game .
what about me ?
i reach that with tsa . i worked up a list of liberians
i &apos;ve never seen him , okay ?
that &apos;s the thing , is i don &apos;t know anything about him ,
so , i &apos;d never heard anything like it before .
and i am relaying information .
i just threw up in my mouth a little bit . thank you .
i got a call yesterday
bedroom &apos;s clear ; no girl .
without seeing all of them
subject to search whenever and wherever .
no legal authority to be shaking me down .
let &apos;s hope your right .
and i &apos;m betting that this old man
certainly not because you paddle faster than the next guy .
now , please leave me alone ,
now , tell me everything you know
trouble is now
i still am , steve .
now how much ?
your brother darryl , on the other hand ,

thank you .
thank you .
thanks for your call . - no problem .

blood diamonds ...
yeah ? you are going to jail .
or your friend &apos;s ... dead . &quot;
your job &apos;s there if you want it .
on this island ,
yes i can ; i just did .
she wouldn &apos;t be blamed .
does not mean that she &apos;s lying to us today .
so , angela and you
maybe you can trace the number .
he &apos;s got angela .
that a stewardess was planning
you can &apos;t own a wave .
a male caller .
brother of an ex @-@ cop you put away last year
the only thing that &apos;s gonna happen here today ,
13 million years , this is an allotrope
s @-@ some diamonds .
okay .
shame . sorry to hear that .
i got two dead cops . two .
i &apos;m going to be flying back and forth like twice a week .
worked together before ?
in my experience , once a crook , you are always a crook .
because it &apos;s not adding up , mary .
two months ago for drunk driving ?
&apos;cause i wanted to surprise you .
because they were more afraid of the diamond smugglers
that that chapter &apos;s still open for you .
because that plane took off half an hour ago .
should apply for any thoroughfare .
and those diamonds on the governor &apos;s g @-@ 4 ?
over the theft of a few lousy diamonds here .
the game never changes .
there was a young officer named mcgarrett
interesting .
i am paid to deliver
i have so much to tell you .
you got questions , run them by my lawyer .
... it doesn &apos;t add up . there are a lot
and genocide on the africa coast .
set up a meet and let me grab him .
transport van contained evidence from a case we were working ?
but another case is not going to make a difference to me .
to fly out again for three days .
see you . -bye , sis .
bye .
in a half an hour . please call hpd ,
like , why would they take you ?
a fortune at that time .
to try and move those diamonds while they &apos;re still here .
on temporary visas .
so many guys on the island that can handle this kind of weight .
in about eight hours , when it lands .
sold on the black market ,
duct @-@ taped to her torso ,
i can &apos;t say without seeing the quality
to put the competition out of business .
and freshen up before the flight .
it &apos;s opeartion of a pipe brain
this guy brought under a microscope ,
it &apos;s , it &apos;s the last number on there .
life is pretty good here
your guess is as good as mine .
what &apos;s up , steve ? what &apos;s up ?
hmm ?
what do you mean ?
what &apos;s up ?
one of the perks of being a cop .
what , uh ... what , are you being paranoid now ?
stand up .
there &apos;s not enough to get a complete scan .
i got jordan . continue clearing .
use the other girl to make the drop as scheduled .
i &apos;ve been looking for you two for over an hour .
the smartest thing these guys can do is
better than butter cream , right ?
no , this is not paranoia , daniel .
that never changes .
that &apos;s an awesome cake .
what the hell &apos;s that about ?
nobody here by that name .
of things about this case that do not add up , and i apologize
this guy &apos;s going to text me instructions .
doesn &apos;t make sense . why don &apos;t we pay him a visit and find out .
my brother makes me nostalgic about family .
that rule applies to citizens .
that &apos;s just what happens . like everything else on this island ,
that might be true ,
this guy &apos;s an old pro .
this guy better show .
the hotel staff said that mary was the only one issued with
this explains
is that why
this is probably the only chance we have
this stone , my dear ,
every single one of these civilians is at risk here .
how sweet is that ?
that this stone comes from
it was angela &apos;s idea
that &apos;s a good idea .
this is about diamonds ?
it &apos;s the pacific ocean .
what is that ?
now this is a criminal file
it &apos;s a pre @-@ paid .
of this one .
there was a room booked in her name ,
that anonymous call about mary and the diamonds ...
really ?
you know ?
we really appreciate the help .
did his full 30 @-@ year term , dropped his tail .
start heading towards iolani palace .
being dragged down the back stairwell .
to prove that you orchestrated the whole thing .
it was worth a try .
it &apos;s only a matter of time , mary .
it would take less than an hour
what were we talking about ?
happy birthday to you
spam is not part of any food group
i wish you luck .
happy birthday , big kahuna
happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you .
turn around , sunshine .
evidence transfer ?
who is armed and who has extensive close @-@ quarter
about this guy who took your friend .
advice ?
play tricks on you . next thing you know ,
to come up with something like this on her own .
to walk into his house .
of the product .
let &apos;s go pay him a visit .
onto a new york bound flight .
with the rest of these lowlifes , and you know it
an innocent woman from being killed
and the diamonds seized .
to bring all of them , did you ?
of the diamonds , we snatch him for smuggling .
when it lands , she &apos;s going to be killed .
and last but not least , an appetizer
at the last minute .
she made several runs for me in the last few months ,
this has been happening a lot lately .
this at least gives us an idea of who &apos;s holding angela .
