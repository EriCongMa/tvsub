no !
let her go !
you and emily deserve a life together .
i need to mourn my son .
i &apos;m not sure it &apos;ll be that easy
to explain all of this to ben .
it &apos;ll be easier than you think .
all this time , i thought the reason
you were always acting so weird around me
was because of me .
not true .
so what do you say , beginning tomorrow ,
we start over ?
i &apos;d like that very much .
there &apos;s a woman who needs to pay for crossing me .
all i need &apos;s a name and a number .
i get quick results .
give your mama a hug .
you breathe a word about the dosing
and she cuts you off ?
sounds about right .
my legal team found a loophole .
you only remain in charge of your daughter ...
until she finds a husband .
guess who just got married .
you will give me control back ,
or the real truth will come out .
you killed your father .
nolan ross married .
well , what can i say ?
you miss some things when you get kidnapped by a sociopath .
you know , there are some people
who say the exact same thing happened to you .
hey , louise is no malcolm black ...
or should i say malcolm blacker
after his confab with that incinerator .
besides , you secretly adore her .
why else would you throw open your home
for your bestie &apos;s wedding reception ?
uh , fake wedding reception .
okay , the marriage may be fake in spirit ,
but it &apos;s real on paper .
nolan ross is ...
... off the market .
and the world weeps .
but not louise .
she &apos;s finally free of the clutches of penelope dreadful ,
rightfully owns her family fortune .
which , given the size of this party and the guest list ,
she &apos;s already spent .
speaking of ...
in her zeal , my lovely better half
invited every major media outlet to cover the party ...
including margaux , who rsvp &apos;d oui .
wait ... wasn &apos;t there a near @-@ death steam @-@ room incident ?
ah , yes . the hamptons .
if you don &apos;t pretend to forgive everyone you hate ,
you never get invited anywhere .
what , do you want me to exercise my spousal veto ?
no .
it &apos;s been days since margaux learned the full truth ,
and she hasn &apos;t said or done anything about it .
so , what &apos;s next for emily thorne ,
now that danger no longer lurks around every corner ?
still going to my father &apos;s rescue .
see you later .
a truly heroic story .
that &apos;s officer ben hunter , one of two supercops
who took down chief alvarez &apos;s killer
and rescued three hostages .
thank you for keeping us safe .
i &apos;m just doing my job .
which i should get to , it being our first day back .
so thank you .
oh , officer porter !
care to say a few words ?
hey , you still ducking the cameras ?
not everyone needs the attention .
hunter , porter , need to see you in the bullpen .
this department owes you a debt of gratitude ,
which is why tomorrow ,
the mayor is presenting you with medals of honor .
i &apos;m sorry , chief , i can &apos;t make it .
i got a friend &apos;s wedding reception .
so be late , porter . the mayor doesn &apos;t reschedule .
i wouldn &apos;t expect him to .
you can accept for both of us .
got to clock in .
i need mayor laken &apos;s confidence in this department .
make sure your partner &apos;s there tomorrow .
will do , chief .
i received your invitation ...
a fundraiser for the daniel grayson foundation ?
honoring daniel &apos;s memory is most important to me now .
so this means you plan to come clean
about the truth regarding daniel &apos;s death ?
i can &apos;t , margaux .
as much as it goes against my every instinct ,
i made a promise , and i have to keep it .
so help me understand how a foundation
in the name of a man infamous for assaulting his ex @-@ wife
will honor his memory ?
by helping disadvantaged children
become tomorrow &apos;s leaders .
the foundation will eventually transform daniel &apos;s name
from one of infamy ... to one of goodness .
i know you , victoria .
you also believe that justice should be served ,
so while i will respect your fidelity to a promise you have made ,
mine is to clear daniel &apos;s name .
i told you that if you go to war to with emily ,
no good can come of it .
trust me ... pain and conflict only brings more pain and conflict .
so move forward for you and your child .
it is for the two of us that i must do this .
i hope you reconsider .
i was wondering how long it would take
before mama barked for her lapdog .
baby sis got hitched to a yankee .
you think i &apos;m gonna miss that clambake ?
now , lou , i had no idea what mama was doing to your pills .
i swear .
i &apos;m only here to broker peace .
well , peace requires a compromise ,
which is something our dear mother is utterly incapable of .
be that as it may , she does have your best interests at heart .
does she , now ?
do you have any idea the lies that she &apos;s told me ?
they &apos;re not lies .
that &apos;s for you .
that &apos;s the police report from the night daddy died .
how have i never seen this before ?
mama had it buried by judge miller .
so that &apos;s why he &apos;s her plus @-@ one tomorrow night .
if you don &apos;t restore the conservatorship ,
she intends to release the report at your reception ...
poetic justice , she says ,
considering you got married just to thwart her .
oh , the threats and coercion .
i should &apos;ve known ... you always take mama &apos;s side .
there &apos;s no sides here , lou .
t @-@ there &apos;s just facts . you ...
he was my father , too .
but i couldn &apos;t have killed him , lyman .
i know how much you loved him ,
but you &apos;re impulsive , quick to anger .
you know you &apos;re capable of it .
just sign the annulment .
so your money tap stays on
and you can continue to finance your campaign ?
i mean , that &apos;s all you care about .
no , i care about you .
what &apos;s your life gonna look like if this comes out ?
do you really think your fake husband &apos;s
gonna stand by you ?
read the report , lou . save us all a lot of embarrassment .
your leg &apos;s healing .
the limp is better , which means you can save me a dance .
one step at a time , you know ?
which tie should i wear to the first party
that i have been to in 20 years ?
well , the blue one is the only one
that matches that suit ... and your eyes .
never dreamed that i &apos;d be standing here again with you .
i missed out on so much of your life .
well , we finally have the time to make up for it .
and i know where i want to start ...
your birthday ,
the one that i missed a few days ago
and sadly have for the last 20 years .
what &apos;s this ?
&quot; amanda clarke . &quot;
i haven &apos;t celebrated my real birthday in ...
well , forever .
well , maybe it &apos;s time to change that ...
you know , to be amanda again ,
reclaim the life that we lost so many years ago .
you helped clear my name .
now i &apos;m allowed to be in the open ,
and i &apos;ve never been happier .
let me do the same for you .
happy birthday , baby .
第四季第十四集
did you see it ?
see what ?
i just sent you the first shot across the bow .
it &apos;s not too late for me to rescind margaux &apos;s invite ,
because that would be so preferable
to a public smackdown at my reception that ...
although , that girl fight would be fierce .
i &apos;ll handle it .
ladies , i am so sorry for being late .
we weren &apos;t sure you were coming .
we didn &apos;t want to bother you after what you &apos;ve been through .
but i guess what doesn &apos;t kill you ?
spoken with the naivete of someone who &apos;s never known tragedy .
for that , you should be grateful .
how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m focusing on the fundraiser .
and i hope that you all know
how much i appreciate your participation ...
all the calls that you &apos;re making and ...
is something on your mind , heather ?
i @-@ i was ...
we were wondering , what do we say to someone
who suggests that a daniel grayson foundation is ...
what &apos;s the word ...
unseemly ?
unseemly ?
ladies , i ...
excuse me . victoria .
i believe you &apos;re in my seat .
have we met ?
no , not officially ... or unofficially .
but i have read quite a bit about you ... hamptons royalty .
natalie waters . i &apos;m new here .
you most certainly are .
well , i was in the middle of a thought ,
but if this seat is that important to you ...
no , of course not . please , you keep it .
well , why don &apos;t you ask the hostess
to squeeze you in between karenna and celia ?
and if you don &apos;t mind , would you also ask her
to send over an ounce of hackleback ?
well , that &apos;s caviar , dear .
now , i &apos;m sure that we could all agree
that anyone who would suggest
that my fundraiser is unseemly
is no friend of ours and undeserving of our time .
don &apos;t you think ?
absolutely .
well , then i look forward to seeing you all tonight .
to the foundation .
cheers .
cheers .
if you want to get your shoes shined before the ceremony ,
i &apos;m gonna be dropping mine off .
did you take a brick to the head or something ?
i said i &apos;m not going .
it &apos;s not a request .
all right , chief told me to ...
what , to slap some sense into me ?
you &apos;re comfortable with all this . i &apos;m not .
hey , this hasn &apos;t exactly been a cakewalk for me , either .
i &apos;m just trying to get through it the best i can .
as you should , but you don &apos;t see me telling you what to do .
no , i don &apos;t see you telling me anything .
what &apos;s going on with you ?
all i know is ,
if one more person puts a microphone in my face ,
i don &apos;t know what the hell i &apos;m gonna say .
but the ice sculpture &apos;s all sculpted .
now you don &apos;t want it ?
look , i will pay for it .
i am canceling everything .
please have them take it away .
except for the champagne , which i &apos;m going to need ...
okay .
immediately .
maria , can we have a moment ?
yes .
honey ? darling ? yin to my yang ?
you &apos;re canceling the reception ?
it &apos;s a little late to be getting cold feet .
i mean , we &apos;re already married .
yeah , well , not for long , if mama has her way .
whatever she &apos;s threatening , we &apos;ll find a way around it .
is there a way around murder ?
what are you talking about ?
okay , remember when i told you
i thought there was more to daddy &apos;s death
than just his drinking ?
mama said i killed him , nolan .
and i think she might be right .
think ?
that seems like something you might remember .
well , i don &apos;t know .
i mean , i was just 13
when he fell to his death from the stairs .
and you know that ...
that &apos;s around the time i started to lose my mind .
lyman ... he showed me this police report ,
and it says that i pushed him .
well , mama had her judge friend bury it to protect me ,
but now if i don &apos;t sign the conservatorship back over to her ...
she &apos;s gonna tell the world ?
look , is there anything
you can remember from that night ... anything ?
i remember standing over his body ,
crying .
that &apos;s all .
but that report says i did a whole lot more ,
and there &apos;s forensic whatsits , and i ...
red , red , red .
look , you may be a little crazy , but this doesn &apos;t add up .
i promised i &apos;d free you from your mother &apos;s control ,
and that still stands .
i &apos;m gonna get some answers .
i just need you to trust me , okay ?
i gave you the benefit of the doubt ,
but your rag made it clear that you don &apos;t deserve it .
i am the c.e.o. of the fifth @-@ largest media conglomerate in the world .
do you really think i know what &apos;s being reported
in every single one of my publications ?
you didn &apos;t know .
that &apos;s your play ?
tell me this ... what are people to think
when they see you and david clarke together ?
perhaps the occasional distasteful
but honest mistake of a magazine
is the price of admission when you wear two masks .
is that a threat ?
it &apos;s simply the world you &apos;ve chosen to live in .
margaux , i hope you know
that i never wanted any of this to happen to daniel .
really ?
because it seems to me you put those wheels in motion
the moment you got to the hamptons ,
with lies i &apos;m now fully aware of .
you need to remember the secrets i have about your father ...
enough to sink you
and the fifth @-@ largest media conglomerate in the world .
then you have my assurance
that my publications will steer clear of you and yours .
and why should i believe you ?
because the man i loved died saving you .
and i will not dishonor his last actions
by going against his wishes .
but , emily ...
you do know i do not control every news outlet in the world .
sooner or later , the truth will come out .
you handle your own empire .
i &apos;ll worry about myself .
you promised me quick results .
where are they ?
i expected more from you than schoolyard @-@ gossip items .
i can try casting a wider net .
do whatever it takes to get me what i need
to expose emily thorne .
i will not have daniel &apos;s name tarnished
while hers remains clean .
thanks .
you know , they frown on drinking alone in this place .
thanks for meeting me .
i wasn &apos;t sure if you &apos;d have time ,
what with all the tv interviews .
i &apos;m not gonna lie ...
i did have to cancel an appearance on &quot; the view . &quot;
but you called . it sounded serious .
it &apos;s jack , right ?
i really hope he gets through all this the right way .
gets through what ?
is jack not why you called ?
no , but now that you brought it up , tell me .
it &apos;s just the aftermath of this whole malcolm black thing ...
the attention and the spotlight .
guy just seems tortured .
jack tends to keep things inside .
yeah , well , i &apos;m a little worried .
what happens when he runs out of space in there ?
but that &apos;s not why you called .
i need your advice .
that i can do .
i figured that you were someone impartial i could talk to .
well , that &apos;s wrong .
i am partial .
but let &apos;s ... let &apos;s pretend i &apos;m not .
so , go on .
i became emily thorne to clear my father &apos;s name .
and now that i have , i &apos;m done .
my father seems to want me to ...
just go back to being amanda .
but you &apos;re having a hard time letting go of emily .
when i worked undercover ...
really with the undercover thing again ?
you know , examine your subconscious .
is that story not why you came to me ?
let &apos;s pretend that it is .
so , i was undercover for six months .
and you &apos;ve been emily for ...
11 years .
right . so a little different .
but there &apos;s your answer .
all right , the longer that you &apos;re under ,
the more the cover becomes a part of who you are ,
and then the harder it is to get back to that person you want to be .
see , that &apos;s the thing ...
i never intended to be amanda again .
there was nothing left there .
i was gonna clear my father &apos;s name and disappear ,
then leave emily thorne behind ,
start over as someone new .
well , don &apos;t make me do that .
do what ?
imagine a world without emily thorne .
快来我家
sorry .
it &apos;s okay . i get it .
emily thorne &apos;s work is never done .
but if ever it is , i &apos;m around .
oh , no . did i get the time wrong ?
we were just about wrap up ,
but there are a few pieces still available .
oh , we &apos;ve met .
at the beach club earlier today .
yes . natalie .
you were the one ...
whose champagne you drank .
no , i was about to say who &apos;s new to the area .
that , too .
may i ?
yes .
you see anything you like ?
i &apos;m not much into the modern .
i &apos;m more of a fan of history ...
like the 16th @-@ century french court i witnessed at lunch .
that wasn &apos;t just any seat i took ...
more like a queen &apos;s throne at the head of the table ,
surrounded by her pawns .
well , that &apos;s a fascinating theory .
are you a professor ?
more like an interested observer on a field trip .
not much of a turnout , not even from your friends .
and am i to believe that you persuaded them not to come ?
no .
that would mean that they &apos;re either a very suggestible lot ,
or the grayson name
no longer commands the same fear ,
and respect it once did .
it &apos;s not easy being queen--
i mean , if you believe your history .
good luck with the foundation .
i was hoping you &apos;d be here .
well , it &apos;s your lucky day , you know ?
i &apos;m giving out door prizes .
i heard they &apos;re giving you a medal tomorrow .
yeah .
they &apos;re trying .
would you take it ?
it &apos;s not a problem that i &apos;m likely to have .
they don &apos;t hand them out for the things i &apos;ve done .
we &apos;ve done the same things .
we &apos;ve covered up killings .
yeah , but conrad was unarmed .
but he destroyed countless lives .
kate didn &apos;t ...
stop it .
don &apos;t do that to yourself .
i took someone &apos;s life , david .
yeah , you know what else you did ?
you saved my daughter &apos;s life .
i did that ?
you saved mine , too .
like it or not , you &apos;re a hero .
then why can &apos;t i live with it ?
why do i feel like a liar ?
well , you are . you &apos;re that , too .
it &apos;s just that one thing has nothing with the other .
i wish i could believe that .
i wish you could , too , because if you can &apos;t ,
then something &apos;s got to give .
no , it &apos;s okay .
emily &apos;s going to use a technique
to help you uncover the memory of the night your father died .
and where did she learn this technique ?
japan .
trust me , it &apos;s very effective ... and safe .
the brain allows us to access trauma
when we face the same emotions ...
fear and danger .
give me your hand .
just focus on the blade .
don &apos;t look at me .
focus on your breathing ...
the blade ...
the fear , the danger .
focus on that night .
what do you see ?
what do you see , louise ?
i &apos;m afraid .
why ?
daddy !
what did you do ? what did you do ? !
did you remember , louise ?
i didn &apos;t do it .
i didn &apos;t do it .
hey . what &apos;s up ?
well , you didn &apos;t return my calls ,
so i thought i &apos;d come by , make sure you &apos;re okay .
i &apos;m fine .
look , jack , i know it &apos;s hard keeping all of this to yourself ,
especially when the whole world is insisting
that you tell a story that &apos;s not ...
i &apos;m not losing sleep
over what the rest of the world thinks about me .
i killed an fbi agent ... a bad one ,
but still and we lied about it .
we conspired to hide her body ,
and now every time i &apos;m asked about it ,
i @-@ i go through it all over again .
they will stop ... eventually .
yes , but i still have to live with what i &apos;ve done .
what are you really doing here ?
i told you i was worried .
about me ?
or that i might , might blow a fuse
and tell one of those camera crews everything i &apos;ve done ?
jack .
i &apos;m running late .
can &apos;t keep the mayor waiting .
apparently , he hates that .
nolan .
sasha . kiersten .
hamptons hellions .
behave yourself .
hey , man of the hour .
yeah . great party .
oh , my .
well , very dashing for a future ex @-@ son @-@ in @-@ law .
where &apos;s the blushing bride ?
you southern women won &apos;t be rushed .
she &apos;ll be down any moment .
well , when she does grace us ,
i want to make sure that louise says hello to judge miller ,
a dear family friend .
judge miller .
your reputation precedes you , sir .
i would say it &apos;s a pleasure ,
but my mother taught me not to lie .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
your honor .
you should take a gander at the ice @-@ sculpture garden .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
sounds decadent .
i believe i will .
mom , are we sure about this ?
louise has been through quite a bit .
there &apos;s no guarantee this won &apos;t ...
she &apos;s my daughter , lyman .
louise won &apos;t get hurt as long as she behaves
and signs the conservatorship back over to me .
okay , well , if this ship goes down ,
i want you to tell me first .
i &apos;ll need to find alternate financing .
you &apos;ll get your funding , son . trust me .
this is gonna be a runaway bride of biblical proportions .
officers ben hunter and jack porter ,
for brave actions in the line of duty ,
we salute you .
how does it feel to be a local hero , officer porter ?
ask my partner .
i was just sitting shotgun to the best cop in town .
see ? was that so hard , porter ?
well , the hard part &apos;s next .
i need to talk to you after the ceremony .
what &apos;s going on ?
louise has gone &quot; bye @-@ bye , bridey , &quot; but she left a note .
what ?
&quot; i did it . i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t ruin your life , too . louise . &quot;
she must have lied about what she remembered .
she couldn &apos;t face me or anyone .
well , she just admitted to killing someone .
maybe she turned herself in .
nope .
she &apos;s out in the boonies , not near any police station .
i know exactly where this is .
let &apos;s go .
no , nolan , you can &apos;t leave .
you have hundreds of guests here
and a very suspicious mother @-@ in @-@ law .
i need to talk to louise .
and i will get you that chance , i promise ,
but you have to prepare yourself for what she has to say .
when you find her , give her this .
she &apos;ll come back .
ms. waters .
new to town and already someone &apos;s plus @-@ one .
such a warm and embracing community .
i &apos;m so relieved you &apos;re all okay .
i was afraid a pack of wild animals had gotten to you ,
considering your no @-@ shows last night .
uh , victoria , i am so sorry .
victoria , bobby had a terrible stomach bug .
oh , no . i understand .
heather ... after i supported you
through your husband &apos;s dalliance with that pool boy last summer ,
i thought there might be a good reason
for your absence last night .
excuse me .
no , please stay .
oh , that was indiscreet .
the point i was trying to make is this ...
a friend is like a business .
investing in the wrong one always proves costly .
and like heather , i &apos;m sure that you would all
want me to keep your secrets secret .
for example , suppose one of my dear friends &apos; husbands
was sleeping with someone else in this very circle
or that another was using a controlled white powder
as a weight @-@ loss supplement .
but this real friend ensures that your indiscretions
remain confidential
in return for your support of the daniel grayson foundation .
so whatever you were planning on donating last night , double it .
anything less would be unseemly ,
don &apos;t you think ?
excuse me . can i help you ?
anna bishop , new york state office of mental health .
i &apos;m here to do a spot check of your facility .
uh , i &apos;d be happy to show you around .
and abandon the admission desk
at a secure psychiatric facility ?
you just failed your first test .
read the protocol and buzz me in ... not in that order .
and i &apos;ll need an up @-@ to @-@ date patient list , please .
thank you .
emily , what are you doing here ? !
i &apos;m bringing you back .
no . i will not ruin nolan &apos;s life .
this is where i deserve to be .
claremont psychiatric ?
there are very few people who deserve to be here ,
and you don &apos;t even come close .
i lied to you , emily .
i lied to nolan .
i killed my father .
you &apos;re right on two out of three .
if you told us the truth about what you remembered ,
we could &apos;ve helped you .
how ?
with some other magic trick you learned on mount fuji ?
no .
with nolan &apos;s wedding gift .
it &apos;s the real police report from the night your father died .
the one your brother showed you was forged .
you didn &apos;t push him .
well , are you sure ?
i mean , h @-@ how do you know this isn &apos;t the forgery ?
because nolan moved heaven and earth
to find the beat cop who responded
to the scene of your father &apos;s death .
but i don &apos;t understand .
i remembered seeing him fall .
that doesn &apos;t mean you pushed him .
daddy !
i was trying to catch ahold of him .
you unlocked the memory .
i just ... wouldn &apos;t let myself see it .
and my mother knew the truth this whole time ?
she had the judge bury the original report
and create a false one to use against you .
how could nolan have such faith in me
when i had no faith in myself ?
&apos;cause that &apos;s who nolan is .
now , let &apos;s get you back to your anxious husband .
well , i guess it &apos;s true what they say ...
&quot; marry the man , marry his friends . &quot;
emily .
thank you .
well bartender said he &apos;d be right back ,
but last i saw , he was hitting on the peacock wrangler .
daniel died a hero .
just wanted you to know that .
i &apos;m sorry the rest of the world can &apos;t .
thank you , jack .
you &apos;re the only person who has said that to me .
i heard you got a medal from the mayor today .
i did , yeah , yeah .
and i left it , along with my badge and my gun ,
on the chief &apos;s desk .
what , you quit ? why ?
turns out being a cop just wasn &apos;t the right thing for me .
too many , uh ... conflicts of interest .
i could &apos;ve told you that .
well , i don &apos;t think this guy &apos;s coming back .
oh , um ...
it &apos;s soda water with a twist .
i heard the good news .
the whole thing terrifies me .
i &apos;d worry if it didn &apos;t .
but i &apos;ve seen you with carl .
you &apos;re gonna be a natural .
to your child .
may he or she grow up in a less complicated world .
thank you , jack .
since you &apos;re wondering , i &apos;m here for the bride .
are you sure ?
i &apos;ve been honoring our deal , david .
well , it &apos;s a big party .
i &apos;m sure we can put a couple hundred people between us .
tell me something .
had you walked in my shoes 20 years ago ,
would you have done what i did to protect your child ?
well , i already did , victoria ,
when i had you tarnish daniel &apos;s name .
but you already knew the answer , didn &apos;t you ?
just wanted to hear me say it .
maybe i needed to .
what with new york being such a hub ,
she could probably be anywhere by about now .
next time , perhaps you &apos;ll be a little bit more careful
about meddling in family business , mr. ross .
lou @-@ lou ! oh , thank heavens , darling .
we were all so worried !
oh , cut the crap , mama .
i didn &apos;t kill daddy ... you did .
you murdered him
and tried to make me think it was my fault .
well , now , darling , that &apos;s a colorful story ...
exactly the kind of tall tale you had a penchant for telling
back at the institution before they fixed your head .
it &apos;s no tall tale .
i know exactly what happened the night daddy died .
i was in my bedroom , and i heard arguing .
daddy found out you were cheating on him ...
... with judge miller .
ohh ! ohh ! daddy !
i reached for his hand .
what did you do , huh ?
what did you do ? !
y @-@ you ...
you &apos;ve been lying about it ever since .
you drugged me and made me think i was crazy ,
all so you could retain control of my money .
yeah , well , who do you think the court is going to believe
when that police report is unsealed , hmm ...
a pillar of the community
or your own chronically medicated self ?
oh . well , that depends .
which report are you referring to ...
your forgery ...
or the original my husband found ?
lies .
turns out the first officer on the scene
retired a while back , but , uh , he never forgot that night .
and he kept great records .
this is nothing but a lot of typical yankee hogwash and horsecrap .
oh , judge miller , that is a lovely cane .
antique ?
you mind if i take a closer look ?
i can see where we are not welcome here , penelope .
i &apos;ll be in the car .
so , what now , lou @-@ lou ?
go home , mother .
and if you dare step out of line once ,
if you dare step out of the state of georgia ,
there &apos;s a bed waiting for you
at claremont psychiatric institute .
thanks for coming , mom .
uh , apologies in advance ...
i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be making it down for thanksgiving .
remember we used to do this in our living room ,
harry nilsson playing ?
me standing on your feet &apos; cause i couldn &apos;t keep up ,
telling you to stop singing
&apos;cause you were no harry nilsson .
you were such a happy child , amanda .
i was .
that ended when i was 9 .
yeah .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s time to start again .
i can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t just ... be amanda clarke .
don &apos;t be upset .
i only asked because i want you to be happy .
that was the last time that i remembered you were .
look around .
i &apos;ve got friends .
i &apos;ve got you .
telling the whole world who i am
would just upend everyone &apos;s lives .
but i &apos;m happy that you asked
because i didn &apos;t realize that i was happy until you did .
now we just need to stay out of the tabloids .
yes , yes .
well , you know , it only takes one guy to change all that .
so then i said ...
lyman .
what are you still doing here ?
i feel terrible , louise .
i @-@ i want you to ... to know i @-@ i was not aware
of the full extent of mother &apos;s deceit .
now , you must believe me .
must she ?
you think i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re after ?
you know , you &apos;ve always been mama &apos;s boy ,
so maybe this will be good for you ...
i am cutting you and your campaign
off from my money .
party &apos;s over , lyman .
and i believe she means that
both literally and ... metaphorically .
thank you .
i can &apos;t believe your guy never came back .
screw him .
you &apos;ve got a knack .
i don &apos;t want to be forward ,
but i need someone
for the feldman bar mitzvah next weekend .
are you free ?
you have to go .
i do .
i &apos;m sorry .
perhaps we got off on the wrong foot earlier ?
well , don &apos;t go backpedaling now , natalie .
i was just beginning to admire your boldness .
that was a very impressive display earlier ,
how you managed to monetize secrets .
i imagine your foundation is flush .
it &apos;s on its way .
the good news is ,
there are still plenty of secrets out there .
everyone has them .
and sooner or later , i may even learn yours .
oh , i suspect it will be sooner .
hello .
mrs. grayson .
my apologies for the late call ,
but i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s been a death in the family .
you &apos;re going to be very happy .
i &apos;m not losing sleep
over what the rest of the world thinks about me .
i killed an fbi agent ... a bad one ,
but still and we lied about it .
we conspired to hide her body ,
and now every time i &apos;m asked about it ...
what &apos;s this ?
the smoking gun you asked for .
i asked for evidence on emily .
you told me to cast a wider net .
they &apos;re in on this thing together .
has the plan changed ?
use this to take them both out .
i don &apos;t see a problem here .
emily .
well , this is unexpected .
yeah , to me , too .
they didn &apos;t stop you at the gate ?
man , i really need to get a gate .
is this a bad time ?
no .
good .
so ...
so ...
so , you want to hear about that time that i worked undercover ?
shut up .
