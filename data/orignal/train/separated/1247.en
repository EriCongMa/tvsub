I need to see some kind of complete draft
and I need to see it soon.
Oh, you'll have it.
Good.
If somebody said that you could start
your own business, what would you do?
Don't kid like that, Lucas.
Who's kidding?
Is that who I think it is?
Sara Harvey's helping hand.
Sara's back at the Radley.
She checked in under a fake name
and she's still looking for something.
These are plans for the Radley
same ones sara got from the records office.
Alison's in the hospital.
What happened?
She had an accident or what looked like an accident.
It's happening again, and we're gonna do something about it.
We're building a rat trap.
And you're the cheese.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
I wouldn't have thought of it if I wasn't ready to do it.
Nobody here is gonna let you do this by yourself.
Leave my friends alone.
I killed Charlotte.
Okay, thanks for..
Anything?
Get some rest.
I'll call you later. Bye.
That was Alison. She's headed home tomorrow.
But Elliot's going to a conference in Chicago.
She shouldn't be alone.
None of you should till this is over.
Guys, she's typing.
If you're lying, I shoot all of you.
Hanna, are you sure that you wanna do this?
First, it was Aria, then Ali.
Whoever's next could end up lying in a casket
instead of a hospital bed.
And we all decided this is the right thing to do.
Okay, but we can undecide. It's not too late.
Yeah, well, I trust Caleb.
I do, too.
She's sending another text.
No police.
As predicted.
Another text.
This is between you and me.
Sara Harvey took the bait.
汉娜
It'll be your last.
Are you sure you wanna rest on the couch?
I already feel like an invalid.
Please don't make me crawl into another bed.
You're far from an invalid.
Even your doctor said, you showed tremendous strength.
You and Charlotte both have that in common.
I miss her every day.
I still feel responsible.
Elliot, you're not.
You gave me back my sister as a, a healthy, hopeful person.
Jason and I only had a few years with her
but we wouldn't have that without you.
Your brother filled me in on everything
he's doing at Carissimi.
I think it's a brilliant tribute to Charlotte.
She'd be...
so proud to know all that money's
being used to help people.
Now, no one can take that away from us, from her.
Forget it. I'm not going to the conference.
Elliot, I love you, but I know you're stalling.
You should go before you miss your plan.
I love you, too.
夏洛蒂
Here is Sara's old room.
And this is where her secret exit door was.
When did you..
No, I, I fought it as long as I could.
But I had to admit defeat.
When Yvonne and I were in paris, and I-I thought I was pointing
to an eclair on the menu.
Then, the waiter brought out a bucket of snails.
Yeah, but who wants to eat snails for breakfast?
You remember French?
Hmm. Now, I look like a guy who needs glasses.
Now, why do you wanna get back down here?
Uh, because Sara just checked back into the hotel.
And she specifically asked for a room on the first floor.
Directly above the old Radley basement.
So we think that she must be looking for something.
And whatever that thing is
maybe we can use it to prove that she's our new big-bad.
So, if I make sure that she's locked out
when Hanna's waiting for her..
...It'll be safe to go down there and find it.
有房
Hey!
Hey.
Where's Hanna?
Oh, she's at the Radley.
She went to make it look like she was saying her
last goodbye to her mom.
Oh! I left the generator in the van.
Yeah, 'cause nothing spells a trap
like one of us buying a machine that could deliver 9500 watts.
Well, I drove to Ardmore to get it and no one followed me.
How do you know how to build an electric fence?
I googled "How to build an electric fence?"
If this whole thing works, it's not gonna kill her, right?
It will work.
And no, it'll just knock her on her ass
and she'll stay there until one of us picks her up.
I know I shouldn't be saying this, but this whole thing
just kind of reeks of irony.
You should totally say it.
If we're right about Sara,
she deserves more than a few volts.
Sara's working off grid.
Here.
Thanks.
Um, but I think,
she missed something in the east wing.
There's a records room in the old radley basement.
Um, but on this current blueprint
there's no visible door to access it.
So, somebody turned it into a secret room?
Somebody, who spent a lot of time at radley.
Charlotte.
I'll seal Sara's secret exit door first.
That way, when we're down there
she won't be able to get back in.
We?
Yeah, I'm not gonna let you do this alone.
Toby, this is tomorrow night.
I was thinking that you could just do the prep work today.
And then, I can sneak down there during my mom's party.
I can't drag my power tools into a hotel
and then cut through walls without making a lot of noise.
Whether your mom wins or loses,
Radley will be a scene tomorrow.
That will be our cover.
I, I just don't wanna mess things up for you and Yvonne.
I don't either, but if you wanna find out
what's in this room, we're gonna do this together.
Ezra?
You okay?
Were you working on the last chapter?
It's finished.
Do you want me to read it?
I'm never gonna see her again.
I haven't said that out loud.
I couldn't, I couldn't let myself believe
that she was... r-really gone.
God, ezra, I am so sorry.
But you've written a really beautiful
love story for Nicole.
I can finally hear her name now, without wanting to
put my fists through a wall.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
For pushing me to finish.
You did the heavy lifting.
No, Aria, I was...
Down for the count when you came back.
So I'd say that we did that together.
If the examination didn't show anything then
why did brother man bring his whole
springman tribe down here in this sticky heat.
and why so many illusions to you and rainbow hill?
You know what rainbow hill is?
It's a place that's famous for
treating famous alcoholics and dope fiends.
I'm not famous, Maggie.
No, and you don't take dope.
Otherwise you'd be a perfect candidate for rainbow hill.
That's where brother man's going to tell big daddy..
Hello.
Is someone there?
Did you miss me?
And I had an amazing dream about her in the hospital.
She wanted me to know she was proud of me.
I had a dream like that..
After my dad's funeral.
I fell asleep on the couch and he woke me up.
He was wearing his dress blues and he looked so handsome.
He came to say goodbye.
You think it was really him?
I'd like to think so.
But maybe it felt so real because I wanted it to be.
I didn't wanna see my mom the way she looked today.
Ali, those painkillers are really strong.
They can mess with your head.
Yeah, when they list the side effects
they should say, it may cause crazy visions.
I'd like to see that commercial.
May cause drowsiness, loss of appetite.
Crazy visions, and in some cases
your dead mother might even call you on the telephone.
Well, I hate that you have to babysit me.
But I'm really happy that you're here.
Me, too.
Are you okay with transport duty tomorrow?
Um, senior turnout's gonna be really key for us.
You know, your mom treats me like part of the family.
So, I'm all-in for whatever she needs.
Toby, we feel like you are part of our family.
Yvonne, so after the polls close tomorrow,
there's something that I have to take care of.
So, I won't be able to make it to this party.
I don't understand.
It's a favor for a friend.
So it's not something, you're taking care of, it's someone.
Would her name be Spencer?
We haven't received all the numbers yet.
But it seems like it's gonna be a pretty close race.
Spencer, hi.
You must be, because I can't think of any other reason
you'd be crazy enough to show up here.
Really, Spencer, from one ex-Radley patient to another,
I think, you'd be a little more sensitive to that word.
What do you want, Mona?
To help.
Help whom?
Your mother.
She's the candidate. I'm voting for and I want her to win.
Is it that you want my mother to win
or you want Phillips to lose?
Look, Spencer, I'm not the enemy.
I haven't been for a long time.
Just...stick to the script.
Yes, ma'am.
Good evening. Hi, do you have a moment to chat?
Because Veronica Hastings is running for election
to help people just like you.
It's complicated, but I'm the only person that can do this.
And you can't tell me what it is that Spencer needs?
I don't wanna lie to you, Yvonne
so please don't ask me again.
Do you hear how that sounds?
A month ago, we were having conversations
about building a future together.
And now you can't even answer a simple question.
I know, I'm sorry.
I have to get back to work.
Y-Yvonne, wait, I--
I won't let you turn me into the woman who says
"Pick me, not her."
The fence runs along the backside.
And we will have a visual of the front.
We're ready for them, Hanna.
Hey, will you hand me the Phillips?
It's the one with the--
with the star tip, I know.
Thank you.
So, did you make a decision yet?
What do you mean?
About Lucas' offer.
Oh, right.
Um, yeah, I mean, there's still a lot to think about.
It's not all about me.
Hey, if this fence is always electric,
what are the motion sensors for?
Uh, they'll trigger the lights and the camera.
That way if A-moji realizes this is a set-up
in worst case scenario, we'll get a picture of her.
What's so funny? Do I have a plumber's crack or something?
No, your crack is covered.
It's just we didn't know what to call this sicko.
And I think that you just named it.
I'm just babysitting Alison with Emily.
But if you need anything.
Hey, Han.
Thank you for doing this.
You're a lot braver than I am.
I love you, too.
Aria, this book is incredible.
Why are you so nervous? Liam's gonna love it.
I'm not nervous about Ezra's chapters.
They're filled with nothing but the truth.
Are you afraid yours aren't as honest?
Actually, I think they're a little too honest.
Are we having two different conversations here?
Because that would be a good thing, right?
I was supposed to write from Nicole's side
of her love story with Ezra.
So at first, I was just pulling from my feelings for Liam.
But those weren't the right fit.
So, I just started remembering all the things.
I used to love about Ezra.
Yeah, but if you're writing about
what you used to feel about Ezra--
And I convinced myself that that was true.
But liam thinks that I'm still writing from the heart.
So it hurts him to read those pages.
How did this get so complicated?
You're writing a book with the guy you used to be in love with.
And it's about his relationship with his dead girlfriend.
You thought that was gonna be simple?
Elliot?
Ali?
Oh, my god. Ali.
Ali, what is it?
He was just here.
Ali, there's nobody in the house but us.
Hey, it's just another bad dream.
He touched me. I felt it.
No, Ali. Who are you talking about?
Wilden.
I'm gonna call Elliot.
What's wrong with me?
How are you gonna know that Sara's not following you?
I programed a drone to fly over my car.
And I attached a camera to it
so we'll see if anybody's behind us.
More coffee?
Always.
Can you even wear underwear with a dress that tight?
Do you disapprove?
No. No, not at all.
But I know that you're gonna be climbing down a rope ladder
with Toby tonight,
and I'm assuming that he's gonna be going first.
That's why I gave him a bag of clothes yesterday.
They're gonna be waiting for me in Sara's old room.
Hmm. Gotcha.
I'm glad that you care enough to be concerned about my panties.
Hmm. Well, I'm concerned about a lot more than your panties.
Spence, need to talk you.
Um, okay, Dad. I'll be up at the house in five.
Oh, come on, it's a scene in there.
Could use a moment alone with my daughter.
Okay, well, I'm not dressed.
Alright, whatever you do, just be safe, okay?
Okay.
Stay in touch with me.
Yeah.
Caleb.
Yeah?
I love you.
Go. I'll call you later.
Okay.
I can't believe Emily left you alone.
She won't be long, she just went to vote.
If you have another dream, just tell yourself
it's your mind playing tricks on you.
Alison, this is all about misplaced guilt.
Elliot, I'm not going to sleep until you get home so...
you don't need to worry about me.
I'll call you on my way to the airport.
See you tonight.
Bye, love.
You're not real.
None of this is real.
Please go away.
I'm begging you.
It wasn't my fault!
Sir, if you can please just give her another call
and just get back to me, that, uh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

Yvonne, I'm going to make this up to you. I promise.
I love you.
Oh, thank you, pretty eyes.
Knock knock.
Ezra?
Oh, yes, actually Jillian, Aria just walked in.
Um, would you like to chat with her too?
Oh, no, that's fine. I totally understand.
Yes, I will pass along the message. Okay.
That is so Jillian.
I know that she can't tell anyone bad news to their face.
Which means she loved your chapters and she hated mine.
Of course.
I-I should've known she would never give me a fair shot.
No, Aria, she just stepped into a meeting.
Do you know how many times I've told that exact lie for her?
Aria, she loved the entire book.
No, seriously, who died
and appointed her the expert on literature?
Let's remember this is the same woman who published
"This Snail's Life."
It's like the worst book..
What did you say?
She loved my chapters and yours.
Uh, Jillian actually said, love not like.
'Cause she never uses, love she thinks
that's a highly overused word.
Jillian's pushing up the release date to Christmas.
She's talking a-a book tour, TV rights, a prequel.
You're being 100% serious right now?
Aria, they're gonna market the hell out of this book.
It's gonna be huge.
Oh, my God, we did it.
Ezra, we really did it.
Yeah, we did.
It looks like creepy Harold
just walked away and never looked back.
Kinda reminds me of a hostel I stayed at in Budapest.
I felt like one of Miss Peregrine's peculiar Children.
Look, I'll only miss Prague.
I'll fly straight from Tokyo to Budapest.
You said that you wanted to talk about this
You already made up your mind.
If I don't go, I'll lose my job.
Do you know how many times I've heard that?
You said that on my birthday.
On your birthday, on New Year's Eve.
Hanna, your life is on a loop,
I'm barely a part of it.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to say no to your boss and come with me to Europe
like we've been planning for the last three months.
I can't do that.
Alright, I'm sorry.
If you go, I'm not gonna be here
when you get back.
What do you mean?
I'm leaving today.
I can't keep doing this.
We'll work this out.
Like we always do.
I'll call you from the cab.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Hanna, you're gonna be safe in here. I promise.
Ali?
发起了视频对话
Hello.
Emily? Where's Alison?
I don't know.
Melissa, it's still the sa..
I will let you know.
I will let her know, okay. Bye.
That was Melissa, she's sending her love
for the tenth time this hour.
I swear she's more nervous than I am.
There you go.
I would just like to say, win or lose
you ran a smart, passionate campaign.
And I couldn't be prouder of you.
Or you, Spence, you really
you stepped up when mom needed you.
It's been a rough week for all of us.
I know we've all made sacrifices
and I appreciate how hard you've worked
you've both worked to get us here.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Oh. I'll be right back.
Hey, did you find Alison?
No. And I searched your entire neighborhood.
Spence, can you help me look for her?
Emily, Toby's already upstairs in the hotel room.
Hanna and Caleb are at the Lost Woods.
I mean, the plan is in motion, I can't leave.
I know, I have a bad feeling about this.
She's scared and she thinks that
she's seeing dead people, so..
Where would you go if you wanted to feel safe?
Do you need anything?
A whisky and diet would be nice.
I brought some water.
Okay, I'm gonna run a test on the strobe lights.
Aria, could you give me a hand?
Yeah, sure.
You're really brave, you know that?
Someone had to be the bait.
Didn't have to be you.
Well, you said I had nothing to worry about.
You don't.
There's no way Sara Harvey is gonna get in here.
Are you sure?
Have I ever let you down before?
No.
But, I've let you down.
What do you mean?
The night of our big fight.
The night we broke up.
You made a difficult choice.
There's something that you don't know.
You've reached caleb. Leave a message.
I have to get out of here.
Caleb?
I am so sorry. I don't know what I was thinking.
来电
If I had just come back a few minutes earlier..
or never left..
Things might be so different now.
Yeah. They might be.
I never stopped loving you.
That's it. I think we're ready.
Okay.
One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight.
The door it's right behind here.
I can hammer through the drywall
but I'm gonna need to saw through the plywood.
I can do it.
You remember how to use a power saw?
I had a good teacher.
Hanna, are you sure you wanna do this?
Yeah, I am.
Okay, no one followed you guys here.
We're good to go.
Are you ready?
It's done.
Ali.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I knew they wouldn't follow me here.
I deserve it. This is my punishment.
Ali, your mom and Wilden are dead.
They came back for me.
And they're gonna take me straight to hell.
We can't stay here, okay?
Yes, I can.
Listen to me. This is like Elliott said.
This is all in your head. Remember?
These are hallucinations.
I can't tell what's real anymore.
Emily, I need help.
Toby?
Oh, my God. You brought your gun?
Get behind me.
I'm a police officer. Stop right there.
Mona. Are you still stalking us?
What are you looking for?
We don't know yet, we're about to find out.
There's nothing here.
Yes, there is.
Mary Drake.
She was a patient here 25 years ago.
Oh, my God, she had a child while she was here.
Named Charles.
He was adopted by Jessica and Kenneth Dilaurentis.
Wait, you guys.
Charlotte wasn't Jason's older sister.
They were practically the same age.
Why lie about that?
Maybe Kenneth and Jessica didn't want anyone
to know that Charlotte was adopted.
Why would Charlotte go through so much trouble
just to hide this file?
Maybe Charlotte didn't hide it.
Maybe her mother did. Her birth mother.
Mary Drake.
Someone's approaching.
Just west of the perimeter.
Let's go.
Come on.
Just be careful.
This way, this way.
Hurry, quick. Come on. Come on.
Lookout.
Over here.
Do you see her?
There's nobody here.
You said she would be knocked on her ass.
We gotta get back to Hanna.
Hanna!
Hanna, are you in there?
Hanna, say something.
Hanna, come on.
Han!
Hanna!
Han.
There's no way out of here.
This is impossible.
You'll need to remove all your personal effects.
Can you give these to Elliott, please?
Yeah, of course.
This form advises that although you are voluntarily
admitting yourself for treatment
you are not necessarily free to leave psychiatric care.
You may be involuntarily detained
if the doctor deems it necessary.
Do you understand, Mrs. Rollins?
Yes.
Can we just have a moment, please?
Sure.
Ali, do you really wanna do this?
I mean, Elliott's on his way home
maybe you should just wait and talk to him.
I'm only sure of one thing right now
and that's that I need help.
I know, but... They put Charlotte here.
And she got better.
Thank you for taking care of me.
If you need anything..
Love you.
Love you, too.
We'll show you to your room now.
May I have your attention, please?
Quiet down, everyone.
I would like to introduce you
to your new state senator
Veronica Hastings.
Thank you everyone for all of your hard work.
We did it!
Hey, congratulations.
Thanks.
I-I really cannot thank you enough
for all of the help that you gave me tonight.
Hey, Aria.
Spence, what's going on?
I should have checked the floors.
Caleb, who would have thought to do that?
A!
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Why the hell did you bring her here?
No, no, we didn't.
I followed them.
Guys, video's downloading.
Wait. R-rewind it.
Look, stop!
But could that even be possible?
I just got a call from the hospital.
Alison's resting comfortably.
She signed the papers?
Yes, Mary.
I control 51% of Carissimi now.
You are the only man my daughter ever loved.
I would have done anything for Charlotte.
Elliott, you proved that when you married her cousin.
We've finally taken back what was supposed to be mine.
And that's what our Charlotte would have wanted.
Guys, it is Mrs. D!
Toby, should we call the police?
"Thanks for giving me Hanna."
"You're free to go."
"A.D."
