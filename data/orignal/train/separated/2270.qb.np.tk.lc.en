第一集
okay , fine . everybody stick together .
archimedes , look .
merlin , look , i &apos;m a squire !
oh , uh , very nice , boy .
yes , indeed .
a fine monkey suit for polishing boots .
a stooge for that big lug kay .
it &apos;s what all the squires wear .
and i thought you were going to amount to something .
i thought you had a few brains .
don &apos;t .
what ?
don &apos;t .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wasn &apos;t talking about the candy bar , emma .
how do you know my name ?
i know many things .
and i &apos;m here to tell you don &apos;t do it .
i don &apos;t understand .
congratulations !
when you do something that you &apos;re not supposed to do ,
even if you do it for the right reasons ,
bad things will happen , emma .
bad things .
one day ...
... you &apos;ll have the opportunity
to remove excalibur from its stone .
huh ! watch it , boy !
but you mustn &apos;t .
leave the sword alone .
you &apos;re gonna have a time pullin &apos; it out .
better leave it alone .
but kay &apos;s got to have a sword .
is this the place , lancelot ?
have faith , arthur .
merlin &apos;s prophecy was quite clear .
this is it .
but the prophecy isn &apos;t what i &apos;m worried about .
someone beat us here .
you &apos;re too late .
sir kay , do not give in to dark temptation .
that sword is not yours to take .
why not ?
because of some prophecy from some old wizard ?
so i should accept you as my king ?
no , thank you .
i just need to take what i want ,
and then i shall be the greatest king in all the realms .
your turn .
i suppose it is .
where &apos;s the rest of it ?
this is all there is .
how will you take the throne with half the sword ?
what will you tell the people ?
nothing .
all they need know is they now have a king .
in the meantime , we have a new quest to begin .
we must make excalibur whole .
we must find its other half .
how could she be so stupid ? !
regina !
well , there had to be another way .
there wasn &apos;t .
that thing was going to kill you .
she saved your life .
don &apos;t you think i know that ?
and now she &apos;s the ... dark one .
now she &apos;s a problem -- for all of us .
she &apos;s still good .
i hope so .
it &apos;s not like she rode off on a unicorn .
she got sucked up by a vortex of evil .
where is she ? w @-@ where &apos;s she gone ?
it doesn &apos;t really matter .
mate , don &apos;t .
get out of my way .
if we can &apos;t find her , i can damn well bring her to me .
dark one , with this dagger , i command thee ...
return !
dark one , appear !
put that thing down before you hurt yourself , guyliner .
i thought you knew the dagger &apos;s rules .
with it , i can summon the dark one
from any corner of the world .
well , there &apos;s your answer .
she &apos;s not in this world .
where am i ?
who &apos;s there ? !
you &apos;re supposed to be in storybrooke .
you were in a coma .
ah , yes , i am .
or , uh , rather , uh , he is .
what are you ?
i &apos;m many things .
i &apos;m the voice in your head ,
the dark one &apos;s powers inside you ,
inside all the dark ones .
rumplestiltskin is but one of many .
perhaps i can be another . how about gorgon the invincible ?
gold ! stop !
yes , probably easier this way .
now , are you ready to begin ?
begin what ?
well , learning to be the dark one , of course .
think of me as your guide ,
but only till you &apos;ve learned to embrace your powers .
i will never embrace the darkness .
ah , they all say that !
everyone who sips from this well enjoys the taste too much .
the only way to stop is to be stopped .
this is the fate of all dark ones .
you can &apos;t just walk away from it .
i &apos;m in the enchanted forest now ,
which means merlin can &apos;t be far from here ,
and the apprentice told me he can destroy the darkness ,
so i &apos;m going to find him .
merlin ? oh , you &apos;re better off with me .
no , i &apos;ll never be like all of you !
i &apos;ll never hurt the people i love --
the people who love me .
apprentice , that monstrosity took emma .
where did they go ?
she is now where all darkness is born --
in your realm .
well , take us there .
i am too weak now .
but this ...
... will help .
it is a gift from the sorcerer , from merlin
on the day i became his apprentice .
in it is all the light magic .
it can take us to our daughter ?
not on its own .
in order to cross realms ,
it must be wielded as it was forged --
with both sides of the coin --
the light ...
and ...
... the dark .
guess that &apos;s my cue .
enough , you &apos;re gonna embarrass yourself ...
and waste our time .
watch it . i know what i &apos;m doing .
well , that &apos;s not enough . you heard the man .
it needs darkness . you &apos;ve gone soft .
you want to see soft ?
why don &apos;t i use that hook to show you your intestines ?
well , you &apos;ve got the fire , love ,
but not the blackness , not anymore .
how &apos;s this for irony ?
you &apos;ve done too much good .
no .
we need someone wicked .
no .
no , no , not my sister .
that witch is more than wicked . she &apos;s deranged .
for emma , it &apos;s worth the risk .
she sacrificed herself for you , your majesty ,
because she believed that an evil queen could be good .
don &apos;t you think you owe it to her to repay the favor ?
excuse me !
i need help !
i need directions to camelot . do you know the way ?
of course . it &apos;ll only cost you ...
two pieces of silver .
i , uh , don &apos;t have any silver .
three pieces now .
i &apos;m in a hurry .
four .
just tell me !
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not doing anything .
but of course you are .
stop .
it &apos;s not me doing this , deary .
it &apos;s you .
so , did you enjoy it---
your first taste of darkness ?
belle .
you should go and help them with emma .
you &apos;re resourceful .
they could use you , even if they don &apos;t know it yet .
if he goes , i want to be here with him .
this rose is now linked to your beast , belle .
as long as it still has petals , he lives .
now go .
regina , dear , i &apos;m trying to meditate .
it &apos;s good for the baby .
please go . you &apos;re ruining my chi .
we need your help .
you must be really desperate .
unless , of course ,
someone was just looking for an excuse to come and see me .
careful .
what is it , then ?
something &apos;s happened to emma .
leave me alone . i don &apos;t need you .
that maple tree ahead --
we &apos;ve passed it three times already .
you &apos;re going around in circles , deary .
now , i can help you -- if you let me .
i &apos;m not using dark magic .
i didn &apos;t say i was gonna use magic .
if you want to find merlin , just ask ,
and find him you shall .
fine . how do i find merlin ?
i &apos;m glad you asked .
there &apos;s a magical force
that can lead you wherever you need to be .
now , if you &apos;ll allow me , i can show you where to find it .
i &apos;m listening .
excellent .
imagine a mirrored lake ,
a tall tree with low @-@ hanging branches
that loom over it .
above it , a beautiful blue sky .
now , picture it in your mind &apos;s eye .
picture it clearly .
okay . i &apos;m picturing it ...
what ?
i said don &apos;t use magic !
i didn &apos;t , deary . you did .
congratulations on your first magical transportation .
you tricked me .
of course i did ! i &apos;m a dark one .
go away .
ah , i don &apos;t think you want that .
look .
the will @-@ o &apos; -the @-@ wisp .
now , if you want to find merlin , i would catch it .
well , that is quite a mess .
help us .
we can rid the world of this darkness once and for all .
don &apos;t you want that for our child ?
my child , and mine alone .
i &apos;m doing all the work .
you were just an unwilling pawn in its creation .
quite unwilling .
if it makes you feel any better , i didn &apos;t enjoy it .
you know , i &apos;m not sure what you see in him .
you know , you can still deliver a baby without a tongue .
enough family squabbling .
are you gonna help us find emma or not ?
of course .
what ?
well , pregnancy &apos;s changed me , dear .
i &apos;m going to do whatever i can to free emma of the darkness .
just let me see that wand .
don &apos;t worry . this little love bracelet you put on me
neutralizes my magic .
i am powerless .
ah , yes , so simple .
you simply need an object
that guides the portal to its destination ,
something that belonged to emma ,
something ... meaningful to her .
fine .
that we can do .
no , you can &apos;t .
your magic isn &apos;t powerful enough .
can you make it work ?
i believe so .
there &apos;s just a teeny something standing in my way .
never .
she really holds a grudge , doesn &apos;t she ?
you know , you should talk to her
because i may be your only way to find emma .
hey , i need that !
stop !
back off , lassie .
my aim is true . don &apos;t test me .
i wasn &apos;t trying to hurt you .
so that was just a wee magical love tap ?
oh , i &apos;ve met my share of witches .
i know one when i see one , witch .
no , i &apos;m not a witch .
i was just cursed with dark magic .
and the difference is ... ?
i want to be rid of it .
the will @-@ o &apos; -the @-@ wisp is the only way .
you want to be rid of it ?
desperately .
aye .
i know what that &apos;s like .
it &apos;s a terrible fate to be cursed .
just be glad you &apos;re not a bear .
oh , never mind .
look , i wish i could help you ,
but i need the wisp , too , for my kingdom , for my family .
so ...
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna have to fight me for it .
what ?
i &apos;m willing to fight fair if you are .
no magic .
i like her spunk .
break her neck .
i &apos;m not going to fight you .
you &apos;re not ?
why not ?
magic or no ,
that &apos;s giving in to the darkness , and i won &apos;t do it .
go on , take it and get on your way .
it &apos;s yours .
don &apos;t be trying to sucker @-@ punch me .
i &apos;m not going to . just go .
thank you .
i &apos;m merida .
emma .
you &apos;re in dire straits , aren &apos;t you , emma ?
you could say that .
well , it wouldn &apos;t be fair to leave you .
i can help .
i don &apos;t think so .
well , maybe i can .
you don &apos;t know much about the wisp , eh ?
they &apos;re born in a magical place --
the hill of stones .
they answer your question when you bring them back home .
it &apos;s about a day &apos;s trek from here .
if we go together , i can get my help from the wisp ,
and maybe ...
i can give it to you and you can get yours .
henry , you can fix this .
you &apos;re the author now .
use that pen .
write the darkness out of emma . bring her back .
i broke it .
you what ?
it &apos;s too much power .
that &apos;s how the last author got in trouble .
he stopped recording history
and started using magic to change it .
my mom wouldn &apos;t want me to .
she &apos;d want me to be good .
honor .
so , you won &apos;t break any rules , then ?
what if there was a way - dangerous way -
to help your mother ?
something your other mother wouldn &apos;t like ?
i don &apos;t need her permission .
i &apos;m not a kid anymore .
good .
because our best bet is the person regina hates most .
zelena .
that &apos;s right .
we &apos;re gonna break out the wicked witch .
you ever hear the phrase , &quot; slow and steady wins the race &quot; ?
i don &apos;t have time for slow .
what exactly is your hurry ?
why do you need the wisp ?
my brothers --
they were kidnapped by the united clans of my country .
just three wee , innocent boys .
savages .
&apos;cause of me .
my father is -- was the king .
and when he passed ,
the clans no longer approved of me being queen .
in my land , people -- well , men --
don &apos;t think a woman can lead .
oh , not just in your land .
well , i &apos;m gonna show them .
i need the wisp to take me to my brothers ,
and when it does , i will save them , no matter the cost .
if it &apos;s war the clans want , it &apos;s war they &apos;ll get .
you won &apos;t do your brothers any good passed out from exhaustion .
when &apos;s the last time you slept ?
what month is it ?
fine . we can make camp .
but just until first light .
okay ?
can &apos;t sleep ?
worry not .
dark ones don &apos;t need sleep .
that &apos;s why i spun straw . passes the time .
you need a hobby -- something to take your mind off
all the terrible things you &apos;re gonna do .
do you like knitting ?
in case you haven &apos;t noticed , i &apos;m doing good here .
i &apos;m helping merida ,
and then when she &apos;s done with the wisp , it &apos;ll be my turn .
the wisp isn &apos;t a toy you can share .
she can &apos;t just give it to you .
the person who whispers to it becomes its owner forever .
so if i let her use it , i can never use it ?
not while her heart beats .
you want me to take it for myself .
i want you to start behaving like a dark one !
you knew this would happen . that &apos;s why you led me to her .
you wanted me to betray merida .
well @-@ done , lad . how &apos;d you know the code ?
my mom &apos;s good with magic .
not so much with passwords .
she uses my birthday for everything .
you &apos;d think she &apos;d change it after a bank statement or two .
so , what &apos;s the plan now ?
how do we get to her ? the old wookiee prisoner gag ?
nah .
i never use the same trick twice .
i &apos;ve got another idea .
hey , nurse ratched , is my mom here ?
henry !
you with the mop !
a little help !
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m -- i &apos;m ...
... so sorry .
it was an accident . i &apos;m so sorry .
it -- it was an accident .
what do you want ?
i want your help with the wand .
so this is a rogue mission .
i like it .
go on , then . take it off .
well , i &apos;m gonna need some assurances first --
that you &apos;re not gonna do anything ... unexpected .
on my unborn child &apos;s life .
afraid i &apos;m gonna need some real assurances .
what &apos;s that ?
this is a potion your sister gave me a long time ago .
to do what ?
to rip out a heart .
and why would she give you that ?
because she wanted me to take your mother &apos;s heart .
you can &apos;t be surprised your family &apos;s troubled .
now , then , this is probably gonna sting .
my family may be troubled , deary ,
but we all know that a heart is a precious thing .
and i cast a protection spell on mine eons ago .
so you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
oh , it appears you were right .
it did sting .
now , then , do you want to see something really painful ?
what the ... ?
there .
much better .
you should have listened to my sister .
no !
you let her out ? !
technically , i let her escape .
moron !
watch it , your majesty .
at least i &apos;m doing something to save emma .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
well , maybe you like being with henry alone .
maybe you like not having emma around .
maybe you like having a hook .
maybe you &apos;d like another .
enough !
zelena &apos;s out .
that is what matters , but not as much as emma .
emma kept us united ,
and that is exactly how we are going to remain .
come hell or high water ,
we are going to put our nonsense aside
and find my daughter , okay ?
okay .
where would zelena go first ?
i know exactly where .
or more accurately , who she &apos;s after .
robin .
i finally got him asleep .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was just worried .
why , what &apos;s wrong ?
zelena . she got out .
come on . we have to get roland and go .
the others are waiting .
what ?
no , just i like when you &apos;re concerned about me .
zelena !
well @-@ done .
you really do love her , don &apos;t you ?
funny that you couldn &apos;t tell
when i was glamored as marian , though .
what do you want ?
why , you , dear .
see , you &apos;re the key to everything for me .
hello , sis .
i see you &apos;ve fixed the clock .
it would be a shame to break it again .
although , it might be fun
to see robin fly like one of his arrows .
you lay another finger on him --
oh , i &apos;m not here to hurt robin .
i &apos;m here to trade him for the apprentice &apos;s wand .
what the hell do you want with this ?
i am tired of losing to you !
you continue to get everything !
but now -
now i have someone to love me and only me .
see , this is my future ,
and i am not letting anyone take it from me
or turn it against me .
so i am going as far away from you and robin
as possible --
over the rainbow , where you can &apos;t follow .
back to oz ?
i may have been feared and despised there ,
but at least i was free .
at least i was in control .
so if you want your forest @-@ smelling boyfriend
to live through the day , you will give me that wand .
don &apos;t even think about it .
you can &apos;t , regina . please .
i have to .
lovely .
now , all it needs is a little direction .
a trinket from home .
now see me do what
you weren &apos;t powerful enough to do yourself .
no !
what the hell happened ?
what happened is i &apos;m not stupid .
i knew you could open that portal ,
but i also knew it would weaken you .
see , there &apos;s one thing our family does well , sis ,
and that &apos;s exploit pain .
now we &apos;re gonna take your portal ,
but we &apos;re not taking it to oz .
we &apos;re taking it to emma .
no !
no !
no , no , no .
oh , yes .
where is she ?
doing what you should be doing --
taking care of herself first .
if she gets to the hill of stones
and whispers into that wisp , it &apos;s all over for you , deary ...
unless you kill her .
i &apos;m not killing anyone .
you don &apos;t really mean that .
what does the hill of stones lool like ?
you &apos;re not thinking of magicing there , are you ?
tell me .
i thought you didn &apos;t want to use dark @-@ one magic .
what does it look like ?
well , if you insist ...
please
please take me to my brothers and save them .
no !
do you have any idea what you &apos;ve done ?
aye . that i do .
stop .
i don &apos;t know what kind of witch you are
or what strange voices are in your wee head ,
but i heard everything .
what &apos;s she saying ?
accent &apos;s a bit much , no ?
you don &apos;t know what you heard .
i can explain .
i don &apos;t need your lies .
i need this wisp and i need my brothers ,
so turn around and go .
she &apos;s daring you .
now get out of here .
kill her .
don &apos;t test me , witch !
what are you waiting for , dark one ?
you know what you have to do .
now go ahead ...
and rip her heart out .
boys , shut down the fliers .
secure the condiments !
don &apos;t move .
i &apos;m not sure my insurance covers this place going airborne .
we &apos;ll be fine .
well , your majesty , it &apos;s coming .
how do you suggest we get this cyclone
to take us to emma and not to oz ?
by using this .
emma &apos;s baby blanket .
i , uh , couldn &apos;t very well carry her yellow bug .
ready ?
twister !
leroy !
it &apos;s okay .
we summoned it .
you did ?
it &apos;s taking us to emma .
out , dwarves . adults only .
no !
no ?
we &apos;re staying .
we are ?
we &apos;ve been on the sidelines too long , sister ,
missed too many adventures .
now it &apos;s embarrassing .
how do you think it feels
when everyone asks you how the adventure was ,
and you got to say that no one asked you to go along ,
that you weren &apos;t needed ?
we &apos;re not turning our back on you again ,
not even in the face of certain death .
thank you .
certain ?
hold on tight , everyone !
you did it .
now &apos;s the time .
you want the wisp ?
there &apos;s only one way .
now do it .
i &apos;m not going to kill her .
you got that right .
go on .
use your anger .
use your power .
i can talk to her .
you &apos;re a crazy woman . i don &apos;t want to talk .
you need to find merlin , dark one .
you need that wisp .
please , don &apos;t .
kill her .
what are you waiting for ?
kill her .
stop !
excellent .
now ... crush it .
swan .
don &apos;t .
what ? how ?
it doesn &apos;t matter how .
has anything ever stopped me before ?
you don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
this is the only way to find merlin .
he &apos;s the only one who can stop the darkness .
quite right . crush it .
the only way to protect all of you .
but to stop the darkness , you &apos;re going to let it consume you .
you don &apos;t know that .
we &apos;re not going to take the chance .
no , wait . you can &apos;t do that .
this has to be her choice .
don &apos;t listen to them .
they don &apos;t understand what &apos;s at stake .
you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s at stake .
if i don &apos;t find merlin ,
the darkness will destroy all of you .
emma , please . no .
the dark one destroys everyone near it .
look at gold .
i can &apos;t do that to my family .
and to you .
she has to die .
she has to die .
listen to your words .
it &apos;s not you speaking , emma .
we can find another way together .
look at us -- heroes and villains ,
together for you , because of you .
and if we can overcome it -- if we can overcome our demons ...
... then so can you .
you okay ?
oh , for someone who just now
had their heart outside their chest , grand .
thank you for ... well , sort of understanding .
no , thank you .
for what ? i nearly killed you .
well @-@ aware .
thank you for showing me the darkness in you .
reminding me i &apos;ve got darkness in me , too .
i was on my way to kill the people who took my brothers ,
but maybe ...
maybe i &apos;ll show them mercy --
mercy that can heal my divided land .
but someone &apos;s gonna get a right good punch to the gut
for putting me through this .
then mercy .
mom , dad , this is too dangerous .
you shouldn &apos;t have come .
we had to .
you &apos;re our daughter .
well , you don &apos;t look like a crocodile .
i guess i lucked out .
here .
we think you should have this .
take it .
you &apos;ll be able to control yourself .
no .
emma , think about it .
if it falls into the wrong hands ,
what it could do -- what you could do ...
the fight to control my darkness has just begun .
it &apos;s too much power .
someone needs to watch me .
are you serious ?
i saved you .
now save me .
and if you can &apos;t save me ,
do what no one else will willingly do .
you &apos;re the only one who will get past their feelings
and do what is necessary --
destroy me .
it won &apos;t come to that .
i know , kid .
so , are you guys gonna tell me how y &apos;all got here ?
well , it might be easier to show you .
you brought granny &apos;s ...
backup generator &apos;s working , but the fryers are shot .
... and granny .
terrible news ! no onion rings !
and leroy .
there &apos;s no shortage of people who want to help you .
emma !
what now ?
stand back .
who are you , and what do you want ?
i &apos;m king arthur of camelot .
we &apos;ve come to find you .
find us ?
my lord , they think their arrival is a surprise .
you were expecting us .
it was merlin .
he prophesized your coming here a long time ago ,
just as he prophesized many things .
merlin . where is he ?
we were told that he &apos;s been missing .
for years , yes .
but not for much longer because according to his prophecy ,
you &apos;re destined to reunite him with us .
now , then , if you &apos;ll all follow me ...
where ?
why , camelot , of course .
well , sheriff , i love how quiet the town is .
oh , that &apos;s &apos; cause i know how to sheriff .
what are you guys doing here ?
what happened ?
we &apos;re back .
bloody hell .
this doesn &apos;t make any sense .
we were just walking into camelot .
what the hell are we wearing ?
sneezy , what happened ? how long were we gone ?
six weeks .
what ?
our memories -- they &apos;re gone .
again ?
where &apos;s emma ?
relax .
i &apos;m right here .
mom ?
what happened to you ?
isn &apos;t it obvious ?
you went to camelot to get the darkness out of me .
and you failed .
what the hell are you supposed to be ?
there &apos;s no savior in this town anymore .
emma , stop . that &apos;s enough .
or what ?
or i &apos;ll do exactly what you asked me to .
looking for this ?
nobody &apos;s gonna touch this dagger but me .
now , for what you all did to me ...
you &apos;re about to be punished .
emma .
why are you doing this ?
because ...
i am the dark one .
