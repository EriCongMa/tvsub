anyone who has a big brother
will tell you that quality time together looks like this .
but my brother , barry , took it to another level .
atomic elbow drop !
come here !
most big brothers were content with wedgies and noogies ,
but not mine .
there was the butt hat ...
oh ! look -- your new hat fits perfectly .
... the waffle belly ...
smells like home cooking .
why are you like this ? !
we &apos;re gonna get some waffles .
... and the one i wouldn &apos;t wish on my worst enemy --
the jock @-@ xygen mask .
yeah . breathe it in .
and like any tormenter , barry fell in love with a show
that made beating people up an art form .
that hurt . that hurt .
what are you watching ?
&quot; american gladiators . &quot;
it mixes showbiz , patriotism , and spandex
for a trifecta of viewing pleasure .
they pit grossly muscular warriors with cartoonish names
against accountants and dental hygienists in feats of strength .
so many new and creative ways for people to hurt each other .
and barry wasted no time
using those new and creative ways to hurt someone --
me .
why ? !
you &apos;ve been gladiated .
that &apos;s not even a word !
yep , barry didn &apos;t just watch &quot; gladiators &quot; -- he lived it .
when he &apos;d hang out with the jenkintown posse ,
it &apos;s all they talked about .
goldberg ! reigning champion of powerball .
you destroyed that food !
and scratched my retina .
i &apos;m unstoppable . i own this parking lot .
sure do , bro .
ohhhh , crap .
it was the meadowbrook mafia ,
a rival wannabe posse from the next town over .
the meadowbrook mafia .
those guys are crazy .
i know their leader .
he got kicked out of my tennis camp for disruptive behavior .
look who it is -- the jenkinturd posse .
shut up , bradley . you know it &apos;s &quot; jenkintown . &quot;
hey , why don &apos;t you take your ice cream
and go back to that stupid friendly &apos;s parking lot
you always hang out at ?
can &apos;t -- it got converted to a daycare center ,
and they don &apos;t take too kindly to loiterers .
that means we got to kick your lame crew out of here .
lame ? !
we got madman schwartz , naked rob ,
and the original ladies &apos; man , andy cogan .
hide your sisters , boys .
but , truth be told , i respect women .
you got nothing on my crew .
we got psycho mikowitz , diagnosed with mild depression .
it &apos;s a constant numbness , yo .
that &apos;s josh millstein @-@ chang .
yes --
of millstein @-@ chang toyota .
and subaru .
and that &apos;s dumb doug .
don &apos;t be fooled . it &apos;s an ironic nickname .
brandeis early admission , holmes !
so beat it or eat it .
everyone knows that the jtp territory
runs from this wawa
all the way down to that weird church .
not anymore .
ooh ! sweet treat to the face !
come on , barry . do something .
don &apos;t take that , man . go . come on .
that &apos;s what i thought .
for the first time in his life ,
barry was faced with an opponent
that he couldn &apos;t defeat with a butt hat or a waffle belly .
let &apos;s go , boys .
he booped me .
he booped an ice @-@ cream cone on my nose ,
and i just stood there and took it .
there &apos;s no coming back from that .
oh , yes , there is .
back in the army , i was a welterweight boxer .
now , i can teach you everything i know ,
but it &apos;s gonna take a lot of hard work and --
enough !
but barry didn &apos;t like hard work .
he liked stupid , convoluted plans .
there &apos;s only one logical thing to do .
i will become nationally known
as television &apos;s greatest warrior ,
and that parking lot will be mine .
i thought we were gonna do a whole thing together .
we are not .
adam !
whatever it is , no .
now , go get your nerdy video camera .
i got to make myself an audition tape .
why would i help you ?
all you do is make my life a living hell .
if you don &apos;t help me , it &apos;ll get a lot worse .
mark my words .
there &apos;ll be no butt un @-@ wedgied , no willy un @-@ wetted ,
and no nurple un @-@ purpled .
it &apos;ll be a 24 @-@ hour @-@ a @-@ day , full @-@ body beatdown .
fine . i &apos;ll do it .
yes !
time to get pumped !
celebratory butt hat !
no !
this is not a celebration !
it was november 2 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and the presidential election between reagan and mondale
was heating up .
but the real debate was in our living room .
everything you &apos;re saying is wrong !
there &apos;s only one choice , and it &apos;s mondale .
that nerd can &apos;t compete with reagan .
reagan likes jelly beans .
he got the hair of a greek god .
what &apos;s not to like ?
well , i care about the issues .
there &apos;s only one issue that matters in this race ,
and that &apos;s taxes .
mondale specifically said he would raise them .
that &apos;s all you care about -- taxes ?
yes !
why do you think we had adam ? he was a write @-@ off .
murray , change the channel . &quot; t.j. hooker &quot; is on .
mom , we &apos;re talking about important issues right now .
who are you gonna vote for ?
murray , who am i gonna vote for ?
reagan .
reagan .
mom , you can &apos;t just blindly follow what dad says .
your father makes me a little cheat sheet .
what do you call it , mur ?
&quot; murray &apos;s picks . &quot;
&quot; murray &apos;s picks . &quot;
how do you not care about the world at all ?
what are you doing trying to rile up your mother ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
you afraid i &apos;m gonna make mom a free thinker
and inspire her to go make a real difference ?
yes !
whenever she gets passionate about something ,
she makes me do stuff .
and the last thing i want to do in life -- stuff .
mom , this affects all of us .
mondale &apos;s vice president will be geraldine ferraro --
a woman in the white house .
oh , wow . amazing .
it really is .
i mean , that heather locklear
sure has a way with a feather brush .
her hair doesn &apos;t even move when she kicks a gang member .
while erica was trying to educate my mom
about the outside world ,
my delusional brother was ready to show the universe
just how tough he really was .
okay .
now it &apos;s time for me to demonstrate my superiority
in all the official &quot; american gladiator &quot; events .
roll camera .
go ahead -- take a whack at my face .
wait .
you want me to hit you , and you won &apos;t hit back ?
oh , no .
i will stand here like a steel mountain .
after a lifetime of taking barry beatings ,
it was finally my turn to dish it out .
stop !
that &apos;s too much !
i &apos;m biting my tongue !
right in the ear hole ! time out !
years of bottled @-@ up anger came flooding out ,
and it felt amazing !
next up -- the assault .
i wasn &apos;t ready !
you think nitro &apos;s gonna wait till you &apos;re ready ?
now dance !
hold fire !
stop !
that hurts !
stop !
stop ! hold fire !
i now give you the human cannonball .
let &apos;s do this !
3 ... 2 ... 1 .
did you at least get the shot ?
ohh ! the lens cap was on .
we should go again .
read it .
it &apos;s everything you need to know about the election .
or i could do something meaningful and bake
my special double @-@ marshmallow fudgy nut butterscotch bars .
no . there &apos;s a whole world outside of this house .
don &apos;t you want to make it a better place
for your children and grandchildren ?
ohh ! you &apos;re gonna give me grandbabies !
you &apos;re not pregnant now ?
no ! mom , focus . you need to get political .
this is exactly why i joined the politics club
and signed up for the mock debate .
i thought you said the kids in that club
were disturbing to the senses .
yeah . that club &apos;s like god &apos;s junk drawer .
point is , my stock at school is plummeting ,
and i don &apos;t even care .
that &apos;s how much this matters .
so please -- just give it a read .
all right , all right .
if it means that much to you , i &apos;ll give it a look .
all erica wanted to do
was teach my mom that politics could change the world .
unfortunately ,
beverly goldberg was a much more eager student
than erica expected .
oh , my god ! what ? !
schmoo , there is a woman
who &apos;s gonna change the course of our nation ,
and i need to get behind her .
geraldine ferraro ?
nancy reagan !
say what , now ?
i mean , she is a real spitfire with a killer fashion sense .
you know , not everyone can pull off
a red skirt suit like us .
forget the suit .
what about the actual politician -- geraldine ferraro ?
oh , that woman with the awful bowl cut ?
don &apos;t you &quot; blech &quot; her .
it &apos;s not about her hair . it &apos;s about her issues .
well , her number @-@ one issue should be that hair .
her hair is fine !
i agree it &apos;s not great , but it &apos;s fine !
nancy is just like me . she calls all the shots .
she loves kids . she hates crack rock .
she even has her own anti @-@ drug campaign --
&quot; just say no . &quot;
&quot; just say no &quot; ? !
&quot; just say no . &quot;
i didn &apos;t know it was that easy .
let me just call betty ford
and tell her to shut the clinic down .
i think i &apos;m gonna go down to the local campaign office
and start handing out &quot; just say no &quot; t @-@ shirts .
i cannot thank you enough
for opening my eyes to this , erica .
i hate drugs so much !
but i love you .
erica had lit a spark in my mom ,
and it was about to spread like wildfire .
hello , and welcome to the mock presidential debate .
you suck !
mike safris is reagan .
erica goldberg is miss walter mondale .
but before we begin , we have a special guest
who has forced me to allow her to speak
on behalf of our first lady --
mrs. goldberg .
oh , sweet dear lord in heaven , no .
look at me , boopie . i &apos;m all political .
that &apos;s right -- in the world &apos;s most misguided attempt
to make erica proud , my mom had gotten politically active .
set it up like we rehearsed .
way , way too active .
hello , teens .
i &apos;d like to speak to you
about nancy reagan &apos;s &quot; just say no &quot; campaign
through a little role @-@ playing scenario that i wrote myself .
hi , popular football player .
i &apos;m a local tough
who slings dope cigarettes outside this very high school .
would you like drugs ?
what will i do ?
my teenage mind is soft and easily persuaded
by peer pressure and the need to fit in .
for the next 35 minutes ,
my mom passionately inhabited the role
of spider the drug pusher in what became
the most embarrassing moment of my sister &apos;s life .
be cool , homey .
i &apos;ve got booger sugar , goofballs , poppers ,
uppers , downers , ludes , wammers , and jammers .
what do you say , impressionable teenager ?
let &apos;s chase the dragon .
no . i just say no to drugs .
and scene .
vote reagan , everyone .
well , thank you very much for that , mrs. goldberg .
unfortunately , uh , we no longer have time for our debate .
what ? !
yep -- erica realized our dad was right .
you never , ever encourage beverly goldberg .
after the debate ,
erica thought my mom was done with her war on drugs .
unfortunately , she was just getting started .
again , nothing .
we have some books , lacrosse sticks , scissors , glue .
you sad , naive man .
what &apos;s this , keith richards ?
you gonna sniff it so you can trip out ?
would that work ?
mom , what are you doing ?
locker searches ? are you kidding me ?
the whole school is calling me a narc .
&quot; narc &quot; is just another word for &quot; hero . &quot;
i &apos;m getting involved , just like you said .
i just love politics .
this has nothing to do with politics .
nancy reagan isn &apos;t running for president .
she &apos;s just a clueless housewife , like you .
now , stop ruining my life and go home !
i think she &apos;s on the glue stick .
erica was desperately trying to crush my mom &apos;s enthusiasm .
be careful with that tape .
it &apos;s gonna make my brother famous .
meanwhile , i was sending off a package
that would crush barry &apos;s dreams .
i hate to break it to you , but i saw that tape .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think it shows your brother in the best light .
don &apos;t worry .
it &apos;ll get barry on america &apos;s greatest tv show .
just not the one you &apos;d think .
we will show no clip before its time .
it &apos;s time .
that happy father got punched in the pistachios
by a toddler for no reason !
this show changes everything i know about funny .
are you sure about this ?
i mean , you already got to beat barry up
in the backyard all afternoon .
do you really need to humiliate him on national tv ?
one afternoon of hitting him with a stick doesn &apos;t make up
for a lifetime of waffle bellies and butt hats .
by tomorrow , barry &apos;s bruises will have healed ,
but revenge like this stays forever .
but at what price ?
10 grand if i win .
yo ! ad rock !
how &apos;s editing going ?
did you add in those fireballs
and karate @-@ chop sound effects like i asked ?
oh , yeah !
it was so good , i already shipped it off .
without even showing it to me first ?
i didn &apos;t have a choice . the deadline was tomorrow .
way to think ahead , man !
once i get on &quot; american gladiators , &quot;
the meadowbrook mafia will bow down to my awesomeness
and be forced to give us our parking lot back .
sounds like an airtight plan .
i know i don &apos;t say this a lot ,
but ... you really are a good brother .
you really don &apos;t need to thank me .
that &apos;s why i decided to get you a little something .
here .
that &apos;s the first day we ever met .
mom and dad said
they were bringing me a gift back from the hospital ,
and it turned out to be you .
you were the greatest gift i ever got .
that &apos;s too nice for the circumstances .
i &apos;m gonna go hang out by the phone
and wait for the gladiators to call .
you &apos;re the best , ad rock .
we need to get that tape back .
while i was determined to right my wrong ,
my mom was determined to show erica
she was anything but a clueless housewife .
my god !
what horrible thing is happening in my house right now ?
something glorious .
your mother is going to single @-@ handedly
get the gipper re @-@ elected .
you can &apos;t get reagan re @-@ elected just to spite me .
oh , i can , and i will .
i will change the course of history
just to show you how clue @-@ ful i am .
so you &apos;d turn this great country into a nightmarish hellscape
just to prove a point ?
oh , yes .
but it will be a magical land
where president reagan gives every american free jelly beans ,
a world where sons just say no to drugs
and daughters say yes to respecting their mothers .
you know , for the last two years ,
all i &apos;ve cared about is boys and clothes
and what my friends think .
and for once , i got excited about something real .
i thought that i could make a difference
and get people to see the world like i do .
but you &apos;ve proved that i can &apos;t even do that with my own mom .
so ... thanks for ruining
the only thing i &apos;ve cared about in a long time .
while my mom had realized just how much she hurt erica ,
i was hoping pops could help me from hurting barry .
oh , thank god .
how did it go at the post office ?
did you seduce the mail lady with your charms ?
she was built like a steamer trunk .
i &apos;m not going out that way , kid .
what am i gonna do ?
i &apos;ve called bob saget a hundred times .
his people are icing me out .
i hate to say it ,
but i think you &apos;re gonna have to bite the bullet
and tell barry what you did .
i can &apos;t do that .
he &apos;s your brother . he &apos;ll understand .
i will murder your face !
relax ! there &apos;s no way bob saget will pick your tape .
all you did was get relentlessly hit
in the nose , head , face , testicles --
oh , god . he is gonna pick it .
that &apos;s it ! you are no longer my favorite gift !
aw , don &apos;t say that .
that honor now goes to the stilts i got for my birthday .
i can &apos;t believe you did this to me .
what did you expect ?
i was sick of getting dead @-@ legged
and my belly waffled .
it really hurts .
and my skin doesn &apos;t bounce back the way it once did .
but beating you up is our thing !
how is violence upon me our thing ?
that &apos;s how we bond !
what else am i supposed to do ? give you a hug ?
yes ! a hug would be nice !
a hug would feel good on my body !
nipple cripples are my way of showing you love , okay ?
it &apos;s how i hug you .
but after this , i &apos;m never beating you up again !
oh , come on .
you don &apos;t mean that .
give me a nipple cripple .
never !
you &apos;ll never feel the painful sting of my touch again .
now , leave my room quietly and safely .
and please -- watch your fingers !
barry would never forgive me
for making a hilarious mockery of his &quot; gladiator &quot; audition ,
but i had a way to change that .
what do you want ?
i know you &apos;re mad , and you deserve to be .
but there &apos;s something you need to see .
force ! force ! force !
pain ! pain ! pain !
no tennis ball can hurt me !
bring it !
i feel nothing !
look how tough you are , man .
if you can take an ass @-@ kicking like this ,
i know you can take a hundred ice @-@ cream boops
from those meadowbrook punks .
you think one video &apos;s gonna change the way i feel about you ?
no .
but you need to know how i feel about you .
you &apos;re the gift .
i could have ended up with any brother in the world ,
but mine is loud and tough and emotionally unstable .
but i wouldn &apos;t have it any other way .
get the jtp on the horn .
we got a wawa to conquer .
good heelwork , millstein @-@ chang .
this is my sack now , just like this is my wawa .
well , well . somebody grew a pair .
yo , dumb doug , give me your soft serve .
okay , but you owe me 75 cent--
looks like someone &apos;s cruisin &apos; for a boopin &apos; .
i &apos;m not afraid of you , bradley cooper .
i &apos;m not afraid of anything .
what are you gonna do with that , goldberg ?
something i should have done a long time ago .
bring the pain !
and bring the pain he did .
barry booped , batted , and beat himself up pretty bad that day .
i ... am ... emotionally ... un ... stable !
he reclaimed the wawa
using pure strength and unreasonable power .
get out of here !
yep , there was only one true american gladiator --
barry goldberg .
hey , sweetie .
debate &apos;s about to come on tv .
pass .
i &apos;m going with lainey to the mall .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i went overboard .
y @-@ you know , parents always want their kids to look up to them ,
but you &apos;ve gotten so smart ,
i &apos;m the one who looks up to you .
i just wanted to make you proud .
you do make me proud .
and just because you don &apos;t share my opinion
doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re wrong .
even though you are .
that &apos;s right -- i will raise taxes ,
because nothing is free , except this country --
the greatest country in the whole friggin &apos; universe .
no one was prouder than beverly goldberg .
seeing erica on that stage ,
my mom knew there was no one else in the world
she &apos;d rather look up to .
we never found out who mom voted for that year ,
but what we do know
is she never neede a cheat sheet again .
unfortunately , the real election
didn &apos;t quite work out the way erica hoped .
look at that .
biggest landslide in u.s. history .
you were right . he should have lied about taxes .
all that work i put in , and it was for nothing .
you may have swayed somebody at the debate .
wait -- i got you to vote for mondale ?
tell me you voted for mondale !
dude ! it worked !
we got the wawa back !
well , glad i could help .
cool .
cool .
yeah , every family shows their love in crazy ways .
some brothers give noogies , wedgies ,
and waffle bellies ,
stop ! it was a sweet moment !
and some moms take &quot; just say no &quot; to embarrassing extremes .
stop showing me love ! too much love !
sure , at the time , you wish they never happened ,
but later , you look back and wish you could relive
each and every wonderfully painful moment one more time .
do you know what i want to talk about ?
drugs -- it &apos;s a ver-- very bad thing to ... deal with .
here we have drugs .
this thing can totally destroy your mind .
it &apos;s very bad for you !
drugs ! drugs !
drugs .
he could be seriously hurt right now !
why am i laughing ?
look at this jamoke !
you don &apos;t swing @-@ dance that close to a pool .
you got to be a real putz to get on this show .
i &apos;ll bet by now you &apos;ve chosen your favorite video ,
but not so fast , buster -- and busterettes .
you haven &apos;t seen this one .
stop ! hey ! that &apos;s too much !
i &apos;m biting my tongue !
my back ! please stop !
i wasn &apos;t ready !
is that ... ?
oh , my god !
i need to record this ! how do i record this
adam !
i &apos;m gonna show you i love you so hard right now !
look ! our baby &apos;s on tv !
i hope we win money .
