第六季 第十九集
You faked metadata, and Diane presented it in court
to get Cary released, yes?
But Diane didn't know it was faked.
Yeah.
You're caught. You faked the metadata.
If I were you, I'd come clean.
又一起福瑞克丑闻
Accusations are being leveled tonight
against Illinois First Lady
and State's Attorney-elect Alicia Florrick.
Charges of possible election fraud have been leveled,
having to do with voting machines in River North.
Many voters complained on Election Day
about their touchscreen votes,
believing that votes for Frank Prady
ended up as registered for Alicia Florrick.
This was blamed on a calibration error.
Touchscreen technology over time
often suffers from calibration drift,
a loss of accuracy of
where exactly the finger of the voter presses.
The revelation comes on the heels of the release
of numerous sexually-charged e-mails
between the state's attorney-elect
and her former boss.
Mrs. Florrick, in an interview yesterday,
characterized the e-mails as nothing more
than an office fantasy.
It was a flirtation.
An innocent one but a wrong one.
I was having difficulties with my husband at that point,
and I got carried away.
But many have seemed to turn
against the once-admired First Lady.
I'm disappointed in her, obviously.
Look, I didn't,
but I don't like how she pretended to be so...
Well, this is a press witch hunt.
They like building people up so they can knock them down.
Now it's Alicia's turn.
I love my wife, obviously, and I trust her implicitly.
There was nothing between my wife...
...distant reaches...
...pizza famous for their...
Mom?
You okay?
Yeah.
I was just watching...
um... sharks.
Is it too loud?
No, you should go to bed.
I will.
Are you gonna get eaten?
Hell, yeah.
No one has filmed sharks here, from in the...
What is that?
It's a microchip.
Okay.
Are you planning to build a robot or something, Ken?
No, I just thought that you should know...
I'm giving you a warning, Eli.
We're gonna investigate.
Investigate what?
The election, Mrs. Florrick.
Come on, Ken, this is bogus.
She's getting some bad press,
and now you're going after her?
This microchip was found in a touchscreen voting machine
in the 12th precinct.
It's called a "Man in the middle" hack.
That means, someone inserts a device that...
Well, I don't know what it means,
but people smarter than me know what it means,
and this thing was programmed
to override votes in the 12th precinct.
How'd you find it?
A precinct captain saw a screw loose
on the side of one of the machines.
He opens it, found this connected to the wiring.
Come on.
How do you know he didn't plant it?
I don't know.
That's why the election board has to investigate.
You wearing a wire, Ken?
Go to hell, Eli.
That's the last time I do you a favor.
We did not hack any voting machines.
Good, then you'll be cleared.
Okay, okay, it's not the end of the world.
Stop burning a hole in the carpet, dad,
and we might believe you.
What we have to do is to stave off a recount.
Alicia, are you listening?
Marissa, do you mind getting us some coffee?
How long do you need?
'Cause there's a falafel truck downstairs.
Just the coffee. Thanks.
Florrick, Agos & Lockhart.
Are we in trouble, Eli?
No.
We haven't done anything wrong?
No, we did not.
Someone else may have done something wrong?
Just tell me, Eli.
That's the thing-- I don't know.
The problem is my supporters?
One of them may have hacked these machines?
Yes.
Bishop?
Or Redmayne.
He likes to guarantee success.
So we welcome a recount.
I mean, if I lose, I lose.
No, no, it's not that simple.
Elections are stolen during recounts.
There are too many hands involved, too many lawsuits.
These votes shouldn't be count and these votes should.
And the press is moving against you.
That's always a bad sign.
Okay, so...
what do we do?
How's your friendship with Prady?
You want me to talk to him?
Your opponent has to push for a recount.
Tell him he doesn't want to win that way.
Not ugly.
It doesn't end, does it?
You win the electi, you think it's over.
It's never over.
I wish I could tell you that you're wrong,
but you're right.
Life...
... sucks.
Thank you.
Yes?
So, did you do it?
Do what?
Screw your boss.
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's any of your business.
You don't get to decide when it's my business.
You must be Mr. Parillo.
I must be.
Is Mr. Prady coming?
No.
Did something come up?
Yeah, I did.
I don't think I understand.
I think you do.
You wanted to convince Frank not to ask for a recount.
It's against his better interests, right?
But you're not dealing with him anymore,
you're dealing with me now.
And I'm not so easily tricked.
Okay, have Mr. Prady call me if he wants.
You will lose, ma'am.
Because I'm gonna prove to the election panel
that you stole this election.
Go ahead and walk away,
but you can't walk away from the election board.
Thanks for the time, Diane.
Actually, I'm just about to finish my report,
and I needed one final comment from you.
Of course, but I'm not sure what I can add at this point.
Gerald Giraffe feels happy.
H-A-P-P-Y. Happy.
Hey, um, can you, can you just
hold off on that for just a minute?
I-I'm not sure either,
but, um, it's come to my attention
that there's a problem with the metadata
that you submitted as evidence in court.
What kind of a problem?
Sad...
Gerald Giraffe feels sad.
The metadata indicates that Detective Prima deleted
the e-mail from the Canadian authorities,
but he couldn't have.
He was testifying on the stand at the time.
Okay...
So, um, then I thought it was maybe Geneva Pine,
but actually she was out of town at a prosecutors convention.
Hey, Dora, you're about to spill juice on the couch.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wiley, what are you trying to say?
Um, I'm saying from what I could ascertain,
Detective Prima never deleted the e-mail.
Uh, no one did.
Which means that somebody altered the metadata
after the fact to make it look like he did.
I'm saying you submitted false evidence, Diane.
Angry.
Gerald Giraffe feels angry.
I'll need you to leave now, Mr. Wiley.
If you have anything to say, I'm closing my report.
I need you to leave, Mr. Wiley.
Let's go, kids.
Come on.
Come on, guys.
Come on.
Come on, Timmy.
Let's go.
Did you fake evidence?
What?
The metadata that I submitted in court.
The evidence that said detective Prima deleted that e-mail.
Did you alter it?
Diane, let's...
in here.
I never intended for you to use it, Diane.
I never gave it to you, because I found another way
to save Cary, but by the time I got to court,
you'd already found it on my computer.
Wiley knows.
He's taking it to the police board.
I know, that's why she came to me.
And not to me?!
I told her she couldn't,
because it would put you in a worse spot.
So you just hoped it would pass?
No, no, I wanted...
Kalinda, I need you to not say anything.
You'll both be questioned as to what was said here.
Now, Diane, Kalinda intends to come clean about what she did,
but we were trying to find a way not to...
not to hurt you.
This is a disbarrable offense for me.
I know.
...to take long. I've got...
Then tell him he's done.
Tell him it's over.
Whats it, Diane?
We submitted false evidence in Cary's criminal case.
What?
The metadata showing that
Detective Prima deleted his e-mail, it was faked.
Kalinda hacked into the CPD's server...
Wait, what? Stop, Diane.
She did what?
No, don't answer that.
None of us have attorney-client privilege with you on this,
so every word you say puts us all in jeopardy.
The firm's already in jeopardy.
The evidence was faked?
Cary, stop it.
This is about the Internal Affairs investigation into Prima, right?
Yes.
Then you have to go before the Police Review Board.
You and Kalinda admit the error.
And clear Prima?
If this is true, he didn't do anything wrong.
They tried to frame me with an altered interrogation tape.
I agree with David.
We open up our books and admit to everything.
It's the only way we can nip this in the bud.
It might be the only way you don't end up in jail.
Madam State's Attorney, the pride of the Democratic Party.
Congratulations!
Oh, thank you, Mr. Landau.
Oh, that's great.
And you must be...
Marissa.
Alicia's executive assistant.
So very nice to meet you.
Well, come on in!
Have a seat, have some popcorn,
the official snack food of the State of Illinois.
I didn't know we had an official snack food.
We do!
General Assembly voted on it back in 2003.
It was between popcorn and potato chips.
So, I know why you're here.
This silly investigation.
Unfortunately, I don't think it is so silly, Mr. Landau.
Well, don't worry.
You won't have any trouble with the election board.
Believe me, we are putting
all our talents behind you, Mrs. Florrick.
Well, I'm flattered, but...
this evidence, this-this hacking device...
it is a problem.
In other words...
she doesn't want comforting words, Frank.
She is a woman of action.
We must earn her faith.
I assume you all know Spencer Randolph.
Oh, my God, it's you.
It is truly an honor...sir.
Thank you.
Spencer has volunteered
to represent you before the election board.
Elections need to be over!
At some point, they need to be done.
Don't you agree, ma'am?
Yes, I do.
Oh, you mean Alicia.
Yes, I agree.
Good. I voted for you, Alicia.
And even if I didn't, I would volunteer to represent you
because I am tired of living in a corrupt Cook County.
An election result that is constantly questioned and revised
is an election result that I can't trust,
and that is why I am here to help,
if you will let me.
Thank you, Mr. Randolph. Please.
"Will, I need you.
"I need you on top of me."
"Alicia, meet me after work,
at the hotel."
"Will, sometimes, I worry this is wrong,
"you being my boss."
"I know.
"But I can't get you out of my head.
"The touch of you, the taste!
"I need you tonight."
"Isn't that a song?
"'Need You Tonight.' "Lol.
"God, I'm horny."
"You were away at depos this week,
"And all I could think about was your hands on me.
"Sometimes this feels too dangerous."
"Will, I had a crazy dream
"about you last night.
"Details later. Happy face."
"Alicia, last night was amazing.
"You leave me exhausted.
"I slept like a baby. Dot, dot, dot."
Look, Cary, I was worried about you.
You were going to prison, and... and it wasn't right.
That's why I did it.
Make me your lawyer, Kalinda.
Let me fight this for you.
No, Cary. I...
Finn's doing it.
I'll do it better.
No, you won't.
You care. I...
I need somebody who doesn't care.
They dismissed the charges
because of what you did for me, Kalinda.
No.
Yes.
Cary, they knew Prima
doctored the interrogation tape.
Geneva was ready to drop the charge.
No, it was a combination of that and the deleted e-mail.
The two got me released.
Let me be your lawyer.
No.
But thanks, though.
I'll be fine.
It's true, ladies and gentlemen.
Only one hacking device has been found
in a voting machine-- so far.
So you think there are more.
I think it's clear someone was trying to steal this election.
And to do that, they would have had
to hack a lot of other machines.
And what action, Mr. Parillo,
are you asking the board to take?
A canvass of all voting machines
in precincts where the reported results
differ by more than four points
from the predicted results.
Four points is a questionable enough...
deviation, given the margins of error
some of these polls...
Lean in, and I'll whisper something to you.
We're talking about thousands
of potentially disenfranchised voters.
Now we should hug each other.
May I call my first witness, please?
May I, please, panelists?
Oh, yes, yes, please.
Let's start with this cluster right here.
Two precincts in Proviso,
one in Oak Park and Berwyn.
These are all close together physically,
so the hackers could change the votes
from a centralized location.
Now, all of this was consistently predicted
to go to Prady by at least four points.
So, in each of those precincts,
there was a seven-point swing-- sometimes more--
from what the polls were showing?
And I found a number of other areas...
Statistics are nonsense.
Shiny nonsense,
but nonsense nonetheless.
Don't worry.
No, no and no.
So, would the number of votes
from these outlier precincts
have been enough to change who won the election?
Absolutely.
Nothing further.
I tender the witness.
Ah, well, thank you for tendering, sir.
This isn't a court of law,
Mr. Parillo.
The usual formalities don't apply.
So...
Mr. Zubrovsky,
you know the old saying,
politicians use statistics like drunks use lampposts--
more for support than illumination?
That's very funny.
Untutored but very funny.
Well, yes and no, because sometimes
even the best pollsters get elections dead wrong,
isn't that right?
Has it happened? Yes.
During the last presidential election--
one of the most heavily covered political events
in history-- they consistently had Mitt Romney
leading Barack Obama.
They did.
Even to the last day of the election.
Romney plus one--
that's what all their models said.
But the actual tally was?
Obama plus four.
Their methodology was off; mine wasn't.
That's right,
you did get the Prady/Florrick race
almost perfect,
but weren't there certain precincts that you
thought went to Mrs. Florrick but actually went to Prady?
I did not screen for those.
Well, fortunately, we did.
And we found 14 precincts
where Prady outperformed his expected total vote by...
four points.
I want to marry him.
Detective Prima could not have deleted the e-mail,
nor could anyone else connected with the case have done so.
Furthermore, certain discrepancies in the metadata
indicated a high probability that it was, in fact, altered.
Falsified.
And did you determine
who had altered the metadata?
Definitively, no.
But all my evidence points
to it being someone connected with Mr. Agos' law firm,
as they were the ones submitting
the falsified evidence to the court.
I see.
The witness is excused.
Actually, if I may?
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Finn Polmar.
I'm here on behalf of Kalinda Sharma,
of Mr. Agos' law firm.
And I'm here on behalf of Diane Lockhart,
senior partner.
Before this committee decides on this matter,
we'd like to be heard.
Well, I'm sorry, but you haven't been subpoenaed
or called by anyone connected with this case...
Yes, and I know how valuable your time must be.
We have information that will serve to clear Detective Prima.
What information?
Members of the Board. I am Diane Lockhart,
and this is Kalinda Sharma.
And, uh,
yes, it is true.
I submitted false evidence to the court,
for which I apologize to you
and to Detective Prima.
It's a little late now, isn't it?
I, uh, I just want to be clear
that Diane had no idea that the evidence was falsified.
It was entirely my doing.
I never intended to use it.
And in fact, we found another way...
Let's talk later.
We can't be seeing each other.
They faked that evidence against me.
What?
Kalinda. Her law firm.
They framed me.
How do you know?
They just admitted it to IAD.
Grace?
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this stuff.
My stuff.
It's okay.
Mom?
Yeah?
Was it just a flirtation?
With Will?
No.
It wasn't.
So you lied?
Yes.
Because?
Because it's none of their business.
That's okay?
Yes.
I have to go do my homework.
Wait, Grace.
Give me a hug.
Mrs. Florrick, thank you for taking time out
to answer questions today.
You're welcome.
Were you aware of any corruption in your campaign?
No, not at all.
No involvement, directly or indirectly,
in anything that could be construed as voter fraud?
Not even close.
I wouldn't stand for it, and it didn't happen.
Thank you.
You've been most understanding today.
Do you want some popcorn?
No, thank you.
Mrs. Florrick,
on the morning of your election,
I'm fine.
do you remember a television interview
your husband did with Mandy Post?
We did many interviews.
Let me refresh your recollection.
In this one, your husband, our governor,
said, and I quote,
"As far as I'm concerned,
"You can take it to the bank, Alicia Florrick
"is going to be the next state's attorney for Cook County."
I appreciated his optimism.
I'm sure,
but shouldn't we be concerned about his certainty?
He was being supportive.
Or predictive.
He was reading
the same polls as everyone else.
But Peter wasn't just reading the polls, was he?
I think I answered that.
Are you familiar with the Help America Vote Act?
Vaguely.
Let me fill you in.
It's a program where states get money
to buy and maintain voting machines,
money that goes directly to each state's governor.
So Peter had control over what machines were purchased,
where they were stored, how they were maintained.
Can you see my cause for concern,
when your husband was in charge
of safeguarding the very voting machines
which wound up handing you this election?
I'm not sure what you're asking me.
Ladies and gentlemen, there are strong indications
that this election was undermined
by serious and systematic fraud,
with help potentially from the highest levels.
But the only way we can find out for sure
is to conduct a full canvass
of all the machines in the suspect precincts.
Can you excuse us?
Did you try to help me win the election?
No.
Did you try to help me win the election by cheating?
Are you serious?
They brought up the Help America Vote Act,
said you were in control of the voting machines.
I don't control the voting machines.
I don't get anywhere near the voting machines.
I knew I had to stay clear of them,
which is why I appointed an independent monitor.
Now, if you want to know more,
go talk to him.
Who?
Ernie Nolan.
What?
He tried to bribe me before I ran.
Well, that's not good.
It has nothing to do with me.
So you oversee the Help America Vote program for Peter,
but you're totally independent?
If you're worried I threw the election to you, don't be.
Good.
Will you testify to that effect?
No.
Why not?
When you were contemplating running, Mrs. Florrick,
I offered to help you, but you weren't interested.
So why would I help you now?
Anyway, I found Prady's men much more open to donations.
You donated to Prady's campaign?
Yes.
You controlled the voting machines,
and you gave to Prady's campaign?
No comment.
You put this hacking device in the machines for Prady?
But Prady lost.
Yes, because your campaign cheated better than his.
We didn't cheat.
Well, good.
Then this recount should put things right.
You should have taken my money.
'Cause now you won't be SA.
You are the chairman of Help America Vote, Mr. Nolan?
Yes, I am.
And you canvassed the touchscreen voting machines
in Cook County?
Yes.
And did you find any more
of these hacking devices, these "Man in the middle" Devices?
I did.
Forty.
40 devices.
40 machines compromised.
Even if just a couple of hundred votes were changed in each,
that would be more than enough for Mrs. Florrick
to steal this election.
That is correct.
So you would advocate for a recount in those precincts?
Of course I would.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Nolan, in your meeting this morning with Mrs. Florrick,
did you say that you wouldn't have swung the vote for her
because she turned down a bribe that you offered?
Excuse me?
Shall I repeat the question?
No, I did not.
You didn't suggest
that if the recount is approved,
the vote would swing to Prady through your machinations?
No.
You didn't say these words:
"You should have taken my money.
Now you won't be S.A."?
I said no such thing. As a matter of fact,
it was Mrs. Florrick who dragged me back to her office,
where she hoped to pay me off so I'd advise against a recount.
My Goodness. Is that true, Mrs. Florrick?
Did you really say that?
Uh, put her under oath.
Then ask her.
This isn't a court of law, is it, Mr. Boxer?
It is not.
Well, let's have Mrs. Florrick take the stand.
Let's hear what she has to say.
Please.
Good morning, Mrs. State's Attorney.
Good morning, Mr. Randolph.
Are Mr. Nolan's accusations against you true?
No.
They are categorically false.
Okay. Can we all keep the comments to ourselves?
But isn't this a classic he-said-she-said, ma'am?
No.
Why? Why is that? Why should this panel
take you at your word, Mrs. Florrick?
Because I recorded the meeting.
Objection. Your Honor, this is beyond the pale.
Well, perhaps Mr. Parillo can specify how this is beyond the pale.
It is a secret wiretap.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but a one-person consent
has been held constitutional by the Illinois Supreme Court.
People v. Clark.
Mr. Parillo?
Thank you. So...
do you have the recording with you?
I do.
Ah, how resourceful of you.
Shall we hear it?
When you were contemplating running, Mrs. Florrick,
I offered to help you. But you weren't interested.
So why would I help you now?
Anyway, I found Prady's men much more open to donations.
Yes, I can understand why he doesn't want to hear it.
You donated to Prady's campaign?
Yes.
You controlled the voting machines
and you gave to Prady's campaign?
Gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. No comment.
Uh, I am as outraged by this as anyone.
This proves that the chairman of Help America Vote,
the organization that maintains the voting machines, is corrupt.
There has to be a recount.
Not if Mrs. Florrick is blameless.
Blame isn't the issue. Justice is.
The people deserve election results they can trust.
Is there anything else,
Mr. Randolph?
Alicia, I think we might have something for you.
I need a better picture, Kalinda.
Howell, I thought you said you were certain. Are you or aren't you?
I'm certain. But I need a better picture.
Look, the hacking device.
Howell had a look at it.
Uh, there's something odd.
The Cary Agos case.
There've been more remakes of this case than Spider-Man.
The case was dismissed based on fabricated evidence, Your Honor.
No, Your Honor, it was a case brought on trumped-up charges.
At its best, Your Honor, this was an invidious effort
by Ms. Lockhart to undermine the credibility
of a decorated Chicago police detective.
A detective who pressured a witness to testify against me.
At its worst, it's obstruction of justice,
and I ask your leave to bring charges against Ms. Lockhart.
An unfounded charge on top of a trumped-up charge.
The hypocrisy is really quite exquisite.
I'm the arbiter of this exquisiteness, Mr. Polmar.
Now, ASA Pine,
Ms. Lockhart could be facing three years in prison.
So take me through it.
Your Honor, Ms. Lockhart submitted metadata
from the Chicago Police computer system,
accusing Detective Prima of knowingly deleting an e-mail
that pointed to Cary Agos' innocence.
Ms. Lockhart had no way of knowing the metadata was amended.
Not amended. Faked.
It was quite simply, Your Honor, a mistake.
A mistake Ms. Lockhart herself would not tolerate from a paralegal.
Objection, Your Honor.
Your objection pales next to mine, Mr. Polmar.
If Ms. Pine's allegation is true, it is beyond inexcusable.
But...
No. That's enough.
I will hear on these arguments tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Dear God, I need a drink.
Okay, well, we're officially the bad guys.
Not we. I am.
What do you want, Ms. Pine?
Want?
You went after one lawyer and lost.
Now you're going after another.
It's always a proxy for something.
So what do you want?
Mr. Howell, hi.
Hi.
There's no microphone, sir. You can just talk to me.
Oh. I'm sorry. Uh, hi.
Sir, did you have an opportunity to examine this microprocessor
taken from one of the 40 compromised voting machines?
Uh, I did. A photo of it.
Th-Then over there, I examined it. When I got here.
And what were you able to ascertain?
The technology's from 2012.
And is there more recent technology available?
Oh, yeah. Lots. This stuff is ancient.
Things turn around twice a year now.
So in your expert opinion,
was this hacking device used in this election?
Well, that'd be dumb.
Y-You'd update it. This is from 2012.
Mr. Zubrovsky,
have you examined the election results of the 2012 election?
Yes.
Have you come to any conclusions?
Yes, there was a very large swing
in the predicted polling data from the 2012 election.
Even larger than the recent race?
Yes.
Now, you're speaking of the governor's race?
Yes.
Peter Florrick stealing an election.
Objection.
I know we're not a court of law,
but I'll still advise you, Mr. Randolph,
not to speculate so wildly.
Yes, sir.
You didn't tell me you were going after Peter.
I'm going after Peter.
Dad's not gonna be happy.
I've consulted with the outgoing state's attorney.
Oh. Would that be State's Attorney James Castro,
who wrongfully charged me?
Cary.
At my request,
he's authorizing all charges against Ms. Lockhart be dropped.
Thank you.
But the price will be high.
We wouldn't expect otherwise.
Off the record,
I can't condone Castro's tactics in going after you, Cary.
But the larger intent was sincere and more than justified.
Six months ago, we offered Cary a deal.
We would drop all charges
if he testified against Lemond Bishop.
Diane, we will drop all charges against you
if you testify against Lemond Bishop.
And here we are, back again.
Right at the beginning.
Judge Glatt was right.
It is like watching a remake of Spider-Man.
Except the evidence against you was tenuous.
The evidence here is ironclad.
There must be something else we can offer Geneva.
Well, I worked in that office,
and Bishop could cure cancer and wipe out world hunger,
and they'd still want him.
Finn, could you give us a minute, please?
Yeah.
Can't.
I know.
I spent six months looking overy shoulder.
You really want to go through life like that?
"Did Peter Florrick steal an election?
"In battling charges of voter fraud,
Alicia Florrick's lawyer
"Claimed the devices at issue dated from her husband's race
three years earlier." I didn't know.
That your lawyer was going to throw me under the bus to save you?
He's not my lawyer; the party gave him to me.
Eli?
Sir, you do not micromanage Spencer Randolph.
Eli, I can't have this.
It won't stick.
It's a dated charge, unprovable.
And your administration has been unimpeachable.
Until Randolph impeached it.
So you're saying I shouldn't have fought back?
No. Either we're a team, or we're not.
Don't let him divide us.
Mr. Randolph, it's not that your efforts
on Mrs. Florrick's behalf aren't appreciated.
They are.
Thank you, Mr. Gold.
Now that you've buttered me up,
why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
We need you to back down from the Peter accusation.
Back down?
Defending Mrs. Florrick by attacking her husband,
there has to be a better way.
There's not.
I disagree.
Is this your wish or your handler's?
It's my wish.
That's too bad.
I'm not here to defend you, Mrs. Florrick.
I'm here to defend the democratic process.
I'm here to defend...
...A hero.
We cast our eyes far and wide for them,
but sometimes the most heroic people live amongst us.
Heroes like Alicia Florrick.
A woman who watched her husband go to jail.
Who stood by him until he was vindicated.
Who worked her way up the legal ladder.
Whose story of courage and commitment so affected
and inspired the people of Cook County
that they chose to elect her to watch over all of them
as their champion.
But people smell blood in the water now.
Party functionaries like Mr. Ernie Nolan,
who turned against her with outrageous lies
because he saw weakness.
But there is no weakness in Alicia Florrick.
There is only strength.
Strength to fight for what she has earned.
And that is why I will not back down.
And I know that this panel will not back down either.
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like leave to recall a witness.
Do you need more time, Mr. Howell?
No. I'm up to speed.
Could you please tell us what you've reviewed?
Yeah, um, this is a printout of the software specs on the hacking device.
And what can you tell us about the software?
That it was remotely updated via Wi-Fi connection
approximately two months ago.
Just prior to the election for State's Attorney.
It would appear so.
Would you care to amend your earlier testimony
that the hacking devices have lain dormant since 2012?
Yes. It appears I, uh...
I-I was mistaken.
Given this testimony, the panel must approve recounts for
all 40 of the precincts where the hacking devices were found.
You're thinking of doing something, aren't you?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Geneva's offer.
I can see the wheels turning.
Cary... You turn evidence against Bishop,
he will kill you.
Things aren't going well with the election board.
It's a momentary setback,
but we're ready for a recount.
We can't have a recount.
We think it'll just make the count even tighter,
but Alicia will triumph.
Mrs. Florrick, I'm afraid we're gonna have to ask you to step down.
What do you mean?
We need you to withdraw.
Mr. Landau, I'm not a cheater.
We know that.
What's going on, Frank?
Alicia had nothing to do with the the hacking devices.
We know that.
But Mrs. Florrick wasn't the only name on the ballot.
There were other tough races. Tilden's, for example.
Who was in danger of losing his state senate seat.
Oh, my God. If Tilden lost his seat,
we would have lost our supermajority in the state senate.
The Republicans would've been able to filibuster.
You see now why we need you to withdraw?
No, I don't.
If the recount goes through,
it draws attention to Tilden's win.
So, the hacking device was for Tilden?
I can't comment on that.
I'm not withdrawing.
I understand your position, Mrs. Florrick,
but your sacrifice will not go unnoticed.
The party will make it up to you in the next round.
There is no next round.
In politics, there is always a next round.
A spot could come open on the gaming commission...
I didn't enter this race
for a cushy spot on some stupid commission.
Well, if the gaming commission doesn't interest you,
take some time to think of a post that would better suit you.
And if I don't withdraw, what happens then?
You don't want to do that.
Why?
Because the party will destroy you.
Or the party will hurt the governorship.
We all benefit from filibuster perv majority.
You know that, Eli.
Hal, can you come in here, please?
I have another meeting,
so, Mrs. Florrick, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stand and open your purse.
What?
Mrs. Florrick has a way of recording her meetings.
Are you frisking us?
We'll hold on to your cell phone and get it back to you in 12 hours.
The party thanks you, Mrs. Florrick.
Oh, my God.
Did that just happen?
Landau's all bark and no bite.
He confiscated my phone.
I think we'd be naive to assume it's just bluster.
No, I say you force the issue.
He threatened the governorship.
Well, call his bluff.
You said that Randolph was doing a fantastic job, right?
He was.
Well, then let him continue to fight the recount.
This is a man who's argued hundreds of cases,
most of which have been probably a lot harder than this one.
The panel is gonna make a decision on the recount tomorrow.
Do you believe in him?
Do you think he can turn it around?
Of course.
Then get back in front of that panel
and let him win.
I will. Thanks.
Has Kalinda approached you about giving up Bishop?
You know I'm not at liberty...
Geneva.
You and I worked together.
Please.
Has she approached you?
No.
Okay, when she does,
turn her down.
Is Diane gonna give me Bishop?
No, not Diane.
Me.
Frank Landau asked you to withdraw altogether.
Well, that's a polite way of putting it.
Well, is that what you want?
No, I want to win.
Okay.
Let me handle it.
Thank you.
May I have the floor?
Mr. Randolph, the panel's ready to render a decision.
I believe that what I have to say
may have some bearing on your decision.
Go ahead.
It has come to my attention
that an egregious fraud has been placed on these proceedings.
Now, I have devoted my life to righting wrongs,
to fighting corruption and collusion
and all manner of ills in the justice system.
And therefore I am compelled to speak out.
I have just discovered that Alicia Florrick
has been lying to me through these proceedings.
It is my understanding that the voting machines
were hacked under her direction.
This is a lie!
Mrs. Florrick,
please have a seat. Mr. Randolph has the floor.
In light of all of this, I must not only side with Mr. Parillo,
but I must encourage Mrs. Florrick
to step down in her role as state's attorney.
She has made a mockery of these proceedings.
She has committed the high crime of stealing an election.
She must never set foot in the state's attorney's office
or any other political post, for that matter.
In my opinion, Cook County
of the City of Chicago deserve more.
I trusted you.
I put my fate in your hands.
The man whose speeches
I listened to and so admired...
Mrs. Florrick, I assure you, this isn't personal.
Like hell it isn't.
Your problem can be summed up in three words:
two-thirds majority.
Be a good Democrat, step down now.
The party'll take care of you.
Everybody wins.
Good day, Mrs. Florrick.
