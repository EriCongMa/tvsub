come with me .
searching for werewolves ?
helping someone else find their path
will help you with yours .
you will see me again !
enjoy oz , witch .
what happened between you and hades ?
he fell in love with me .
nice shot .
red ?
is she okay ?
why is she down here ? - she &apos;s not --
no , she &apos;s still breathing .
well , how long do you think she &apos;ll be out ?
i don &apos;t know . we hit her with some strong stuff .
where has she been since she left storybrooke ?
i don &apos;t know . she went to find her pack .
unless they &apos;re dead ,
i &apos;d say she &apos;s sniffing in the wrong place .
any explanation ? for what she &apos;s doing here ?
just this .
over here . this way .
right behind you .
what is it ?
i lost the scent again .
ruby , it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll find your pack .
that &apos;s what you said yesterday and the day before .
it &apos;s late . come on .
tell me everything you know about this land .
there &apos;s supposed to be a lot of singing .
singing ?
well , there was in the movie .
i saw it in storybrooke .
i think there was a book , too .
ruby , ? this isn &apos;t a book or a movie .
well , whatever it is ,
there &apos;s no trace of my pack &apos;s scent .
i don &apos;t think they were ever here to begin with .
well , we better start looking for a way back
to the enchanted forest .
wait .
it &apos;s okay .
i think i know who this little guy is .
toto ?
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
toto only barks for one reason --
when he has sniffed out a witch .
who is it ? who &apos;s the witch ?
he &apos;s not barking because i &apos;m a witch .
it &apos;s ...
ruby , it &apos;s okay . you can tell her .
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m part wolf .
but there &apos;s nothing to be scared of .
see ?
wait , don &apos;t ! toto !
why did you do that ?
toto .
well , let us help you .
you &apos;ve done enough .
you &apos;re going the wrong way .
now you &apos;re an expert on oz .
no . but i can tell you ...
... he &apos;s headed northwest .
straight into the wind .
through a juniper field into a valley of pines .
come on .
no .
what is it ?
the wicked witch . let &apos;s go .
would you prefer i send you chocolates next time ?
if you &apos;re looking for a thank you ,
maybe you should write your name on the card next time .
i &apos;m afraid i didn &apos;t come to woo you , zelena .
i came to warn you .
about what ?
you have a visitor from oz .
what ? who ?
let &apos;s just say a werewolf crash @-@ landed here --
feisty , looks good in red .
oh , no .
oh , that &apos;s impossible , not after what i did to her .
must have been quite well , wicked
for her to chase you all the way down here .
wicked doesn &apos;t begin to describe it .
whatever goodwill i &apos;ve earned with my sister
will evaporate the minute she learns the truth
of what i did to their friend .
i need to leave before they find me .
the underworld ? easier said than done .
need i remind you i &apos;m very much alive .
and i have my own way home .
and you daughter -- you &apos;re just gonna leave her down here ?
no , she &apos;s why i &apos;m leaving .
if i stay , if i face that wolf ,
i &apos;m just gonna do something else that i &apos;ll regret .
and then regina will never let me see her again .
you certainly won &apos;t get your daughter back by running .
stay .
face them .
let me guess -- with you .
we make quite a team .
you can trust me , zelena .
i &apos;ll give you everything you want .
sorry , hades ,
my time in the underworld is over .
do what you must .
but just know either way
i &apos;m gonna take care of that wolf .
stop torturing yourself , belle .
no , i -- i gave gaston this book to teach him
that a true hero needs to show his enemy compassion .
right ?
but in the moment ? that i could &apos;ve shown him mercy ,
what , i send him ? to a fate worse than death .
belle , you were trying to protect our child .
yeah , and -- and you know ,
if hades had actually destroyed the contract ,
then maybe i could live with what i did .
but he found a loophole ,
and i darkened my soul , rumple ,
just -- just to save you .
and now we can free our child
from hades &apos; grasp together .
no , i @-@ i need to ? make this right on my own .
i leave it up to you ,
you &apos;ll just make me do something else i &apos;ll regret .
the underworld ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i used a tracking spell
so the cyclone would bring me to zelena .
ruby , she &apos;s down here , too .
wait , love , you came down here looking for zelena ?
why am i not surprised ?
what did my sister do now ?
it &apos;s my friend , dorothy .
zelena wanted her magic slippers
so that she could get back to her baby .
ruby , what did zelena do to your friend ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . i don &apos;t know .
dorothy went to face her and just disappeared .
mulan and i looked everywhere , but we couldn &apos;t find her .
‭ snow , this is all my fault .
none of this would have happened if i hadn &apos;t show up in oz .
it &apos;s just one more life that i have destroyed
because of what i am .
that is not true , and you know it .
ruby , we &apos;ll find out what happened to dorothy . i promise .
there &apos;s only one way we &apos;re gonna do that .
it &apos;s time to talk to zelena .
i &apos;m coming .
i actually thought we were getting somewhere with her .
david . will you do something while i &apos;m gone ?
sure . what is it ?
well , we haven &apos;t --
neal hasn &apos;t heard our voices in days ,
and i &apos;m getting a little
yeah , me too .
i &apos;ll call him for the both of us .
thank you . oh , take hook with you .
streets aren &apos;t safe for anyone to be alone right now .
yeah , i &apos;ll be careful .
believe me , i will tell neal the reason
why his mother is not on the line --
&apos;cause she &apos;s out doing what she does best ,
being a hero .
careful , lad . hades has eyes and ears everywhere .
we can &apos;t trust anyone here .
is the line always this long ?
it &apos;s not a line . something &apos;s wrong .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what does it look like , darling ?
i &apos;m fulfilling my mayoral responsibilities
by supervising some municipal improvements .
get on with it , claude . rip it out .
no , no , no , no !
this is the only chance these people have
to contact their loved ones .
oh , you mean it &apos;s your only opportunity
to reach out and haunt your infant son .
looks like chisel chin , jr . will just have to go to bed
without what i can imagine
are terribly dull bedtime stories .
cruella , why are you doing this ?
is this because i won &apos;t write you back to life ?
no , henry darling .
i &apos;m not the one that ordered
all the phones to be ripped out down here .
hades .
well , with all you heroes running around ,
the place he feels has a little too much hope
bubbling up in his realm .
well , you can tell him it &apos;s gonna take a lot more
than ripping out phones to discourage us .
i will .
but in the meantime , if you wanted to strike a deal ,
i could look the other way while you made one last call .
i &apos;m assuming i &apos;d have the author and his pen
to write me back to life .
we &apos;re not making deals with you .
have it your way .
do it , claude .
ta @-@ ta , darlings .
i &apos;ll come back for you when the time &apos;s right ,
my little sweet pea .
but for now , you &apos;re with the people
that can give you what you need .
you &apos;re not going anywhere , sis .
how do you expect me to become mother material
if you won &apos;t leave me be ?
well , we were planning on it
until someone you screwed over
literally dropped out of the sky .
what did you do to dorothy ?
it touched down right here .
toto ? toto !
there &apos;s nothing here .
or here .
toto .
looking for me ?
i see you picked up a few strays while i was gone .
watch it , zelena .
you really want to mess with us again ?
you know you &apos;re not welcome in oz anymore .
you think i want to be in this emerald @-@ tinted dump ?
i was banished here by your friends .
i &apos;m sure they had good reason .
of course . to keep me from my newborn baby .
right .
it &apos;s the truth .
you see , dorothy , you may have the love of oz ,
but i have something better -- the love of my child .
she needs her mommy ,
so you &apos;re gonna take me straight back to her right now .
where are my silver slippers ?
you gave them to me ,
and i &apos;m not going to give them back .
well , then ...
maybe you &apos;ll think again
when you see who i found sniffing through this rubble .
toto . don &apos;t you --
your mutt for the slippers .
you &apos;ve got until sundown tomorrow
to decide which you prefer .
zelena , tell us what you did to dorothy .
fight your instincts and help us .
it &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll ever see your little girl again .
trust me .
no .
i &apos;m afraid i can &apos;t fix this .
even i can &apos;t help dorothy now .
why not ?
you killed her ?
not quite .
i took a page out of your book , regina .
sleeping curse .
you need to wake her up .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to tell you -- i can &apos;t .
dorothy may have the love of the people of oz ,
but there &apos;s only one thing that could help her now .
true love &apos;s kiss .
no family , unmarried , unloved , all alone .
there &apos;s no one that can give dorothy what she needs .
i &apos;m afraid sometimes ...
i &apos;m just too clever .
it &apos;s a simple trade really .
the slippers for my daughter .
really ?
you think you &apos;re in a position to bargain with your own child ?
you trapped dorothy in an unbreakable curse .
i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m good at what i do .
stop hiding behind all that bluster .
you &apos;re not proud -- you &apos;re caught .
look .
i get it .
you did a terrible thing , but just because
you made one bad move --
or 30 --
doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t make a good one now .
zelena .
you can come back from this .
trust me , i know .
think so ?
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out ...
if you try .
here .
you can keep your pep talks .
i have no delusions that anything will change .
not you , not me .
i hope they wake her .
and if you need me ,
i &apos;ll be right here .
we have to do something .
dorothy is all alone back there .
she doesn &apos;t have anyone .
not for long .
these can at least get you back to oz .
how did you get her to hand those over to you ?
you &apos;re not going to believe me , but all i did was ask .
what good are slippers if there is no one back in oz
that can give dorothy true love &apos;s kiss ?
are you sure there isn &apos;t anyone ?
her family was awful to her .
and the only person that she has ever loved
was her deceased aunt em .
she may still be here .
all we have to do is find her .
this is the best shot we &apos;ve got to get toto back .
are you sure it &apos;ll work on her ?
sleeping powder knocked zelena out before .
it should again .
i just need one more ingredient to give it its kick .
poppies .
i know exactly where we can get some .
i &apos;m coming with you . mulan , keep the cauldron going .
i can handle myself .
i wasn &apos;t asking permission .
either you &apos;re still mad at me or you don &apos;t like to talk .
you really want me to answer that ?
toto &apos;s more than a pet , isn &apos;t he ?
you &apos;re right .
i don &apos;t like to talk .
shouldn &apos;t i know what we &apos;re fighting for ?
fine .
you want to know ?
the first time i visited oz , i was just a kid .
i wasn &apos;t here long , but when i went back to kansas ,
i told my family what happened .
what ? they didn &apos;t believe you ?
they tried to have me committed .
i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be .
showed me who my real family was -- aunt em .
she believed me .
she kept me from getting locked up .
is she still back in kansas ?
she died not long after that .
but just before she did , she gave me toto .
he &apos;s all you have left of her .
he &apos;s the only one who understands me .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re gonna get him back .
you know , i understand what it &apos;s like to feel
like you don &apos;t belong anywhere .
really , wolfie ?
your family tried to have you committed ?
no , my entire village ran me out of town .
really ?
with torches and pitchforks .
because you &apos;re a wolf ?
i didn &apos;t always know i was ,
and i certainly didn &apos;t back then . i wasn &apos;t in control .
and one night , i accidentally ...
killed my boyfriend .
yeah .
i lived on the run after that , and ...
i eventually learned to control my power ,
made some friends along the way .
i ended up in a town called storybrooke , but ...
i still felt like there was something missing .
and you came to oz looking for answers .
i came here looking for my pack .
i thought maybe they were what was missing , but ...
after searching for so long , i &apos;m ...
not sure if they &apos;re the answer anymore .
what are you looking for ?
i &apos;m not sure .
well , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
come on . field &apos;s up ahead .
that &apos;s her . that &apos;s auntie em .
it &apos;s not cracked or tipped . she &apos;s still down here .
well , what are we waiting for ? let &apos;s find her .
it &apos;s not that simple .
if she &apos;s dead , she can &apos;t just leave the underworld
to give dorothy true love &apos;s kiss .
maybe she doesn &apos;t have to .
the other day , the blind witch bottled david &apos;s breath .
what ? why would she do that ?
yeah , well , she roasted children in her previous life .
do we even want the answer to that ?
the point is maybe we can do the same thing
with the kiss from aunt em .
ruby could use the slippers to deliver it dorothy in oz .
snow ! we &apos;ve been looking everywhere for you .
what is it ? did you talk to neal ?
hades ripped out the phone .
he &apos;s cut us off from storybrooke .
what ? why ?
snow , neal &apos;s fine .
wait , no , we don &apos;t know that .
i mean , maybe hades did this for a reason .
maybe he &apos;s gonna make a move on storybrooke
now that we &apos;re trapped down here .
this is exactly what he wants -- for us all to lose hope .
well , it &apos;s hard not to when our child &apos;s life might be in danger .
mom , i think it &apos;s time .
for what ?
for you to go home -- both of you .
we haven &apos;t completed our mission .
we haven &apos;t defeated hades .
you &apos;ve done more for me than you know
and so many down here .
and i meant what i said -- we came because we wanted to .
because i needed you .
now your other kid needs you more .
and storybrooke might , too .
well , what about hades ?
we don &apos;t even know how to begin to fight him yet .
well , we &apos;ll just have to find a way to wage our war
without the charmings .
but this is the underworld . we can &apos;t just walk out .
you can with the slippers .
go to oz with ruby .
once you help dorothy ,
you can click your way back to storybrooke .
mom , dad , you &apos;ve done enough .
go take care of the rest of our family .
i &apos;m gonna be okay .
you all are forgetting something .
hades carved snow &apos;s name on a tombstone .
emma , you couldn &apos;t take it off .
even with the slippers , she can &apos;t leave .
i can &apos;t ...
but you can .
belle . to what do i owe the honor ?
are you here to tear my crying baby from my arms again ?
i need your help .
please . i &apos;m asking you as a mother .
and what makes you think hades would listen to me ?
i know that he &apos;s in love with you .
my sister &apos;s got an even bigger mouth than i thought .
sorry , but hades would never rip up
one of his precious contracts even if i asked .
please , zelena , you know what it &apos;s like
to have to lose a child .
why come to me when you &apos;ve got the dark one on your side .
yeah , can &apos;t really trust him right now .
so , you finally see the beast behind the man .
maybe you can understand
why i &apos;m not rushing to hades with open arms .
well , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s because of me and rumple .
i think it &apos;s because you &apos;re scared .
of the lord of death ?
please .
i just know the truth .
i &apos;m never going to get my happy ending .
not with hades , not with my daughter , not with anyone .
how do you know that if you haven &apos;t tried ?
oh , i have tried .
look where i am .
‭ drinking with the bookworm .
oh , come on . if i disgust you that much ,
maybe you should leave .
no .
no , it &apos;s , uh ...
it &apos;s -- it &apos;s not that .
it &apos;s just morning sickness .
you remember what that &apos;s like .
actually , i don &apos;t .
not since the dark swan
made sure my pregnancy lasted all of 10 minutes .
wait .
hades , if -- if he decides he wants my child now ,
he could speed up my pregnancy , too .
i &apos;d love to say that he isn &apos;t capable of such a thing ,
but i can assure you he is .
no .
and i -- i thought that i had time on my side .
i guess i don &apos;t .
that &apos;s not necessarily true .
there may be a way .
anything ?
just that auntie em died in kansas --
no details , not a clue .
i can &apos;t believe it has to be me .
snow should be home .
she should be with our boy . she should be going .
she missed this time with emma ,
and now it &apos;s happening all over again .
we shouldn &apos;t be here .
i didn &apos;t --
no , no , no , you &apos;re right . you shouldn &apos;t be here .
i realized that i haven &apos;t said it yet , but thank you .
i didn &apos;t want emma to do this ,
let alone drag everyone along .
hey , we made our own choices .
really ? i didn &apos;t know you cared .
all right , i did it for emma .
ah , figured .
and i ...
... guess you &apos;ve grown on me a bit .
well , i tend to have that effect on people .
all right , don &apos;t push it .
look , your name &apos;s not on the headstone , mate .
you can go .
ruby is your ticket out of here .
you have to take it .
i wish it didn &apos;t have to be like this ,
but you &apos;re right .
i just hope we can help ruby .
the poppy field .
this is zelena &apos;s territory .
we need to be careful .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
calling you &quot; wolfie . &quot;
if i had known --
no . it &apos;s okay .
i actually kind of like it .
but i do think it &apos;s only fair
that i get to give you a nickname , too .
really ?
really .
how about &quot; kansas &quot; ?
all right , wolfie , kansas it is .
careful .
one sniff of that , and we &apos;ll be snoozing all night .
thanks .
zelena -- she found us .
there &apos;s more on the way .
we &apos;ll never outrun them .
well , sure we can .
how ?
do you trust me ?
yes .
what happened ?
zelena . we were almost monkey chow .
are you okay ?
dorothy ?
yeah , i &apos;m just ... tired .
maybe it was all the poppies .
i &apos;m gonna get some shut eye .
sorry , no dogs allowed .
no one talks to me like that in my diner .
it &apos;s not yours , dear , not yet .
there &apos;s a tombstone in the cemetery -- emily brown .
why don &apos;t you make this easy and tell us where to find her ?
what do i get out of it ?
the wolf keeps her cloak on .
unless you want to start putting your customers on the menu .
fine .
i know her .
yeah ?
yeah .
i hate that auntie em .
why &apos;s that ?
she &apos;s the competition .
welcome to auntie &apos;s .
the potpies are my own family recipe ,
but we do a good roasted chicken , too .
rotisserie -- any way you want .
but the soup , well , the soup is to die for .
unless you &apos;re already dead .
then it &apos;s , uh -- well , you know what i mean .
we &apos;re trying to help dorothy .
you know my dorothy ?
yes .
she &apos;s not down here , is she ?
no , she &apos;s alive , but she needs your help .
she needs true love &apos;s kiss .
all you need to do is blow a kiss into the bottle .
maybe helping dorothy is your unfinished business .
maybe that &apos;s why you &apos;re down here .
what ? what ?
what &apos;s happening ?
emma , what did you do ?
can somebody help her ?
emma .
i didn &apos;t do anything .
no ! no !
somebody do something .
what the hell was that ?
i don &apos;t think the soup agreed with that .
you did this .
mm . guilty .
a little water from the river of souls
gives the soup a little something ... special .
why would you hurt her ? she was just a sweet old lady .
mm . isn &apos;t it obvious ?
because you &apos;re trying to help her .
and dorothy ,
who happens to be zelena &apos;s sworn enemy .
did she put you up to this ?
trust me , she has no idea i &apos;m here .
this is about so much more than just your sister .
let &apos;s call it a teachable moment .
you wouldn &apos;t be here unless you were scared
we might actually win this fight .
yes .
is that so , savior ?
because i don &apos;t think dorothy &apos;s dear old aunt
would agree with you .
citizens of the underworld , from now on ,
this is what happens to anyone
who deals with these so @-@ called heroes .
so , who &apos;s next in line for their help ?
it &apos;s hard to be a savior
when no on wants you to save them .
i gave the vial of powder to dorothy .
we attack at first light .
good .
good .
that doesn &apos;t sound like a very convincing battle cry .
ruby , what &apos;s going on ?
when we were on our trek , dorothy asked me
what i &apos;ve been looking for this whole time .
and i told her that i didn &apos;t know .
well , do you ?
i think ...
i think that ...
i &apos;ve been looking for someone like her .
and i know we just met ,
but i have never felt like this about anyone before .
that &apos;s great .
so , what &apos;s wrong ?
you saw how she looked at me when i transformed .
she could barely bring herself to say anything .
maybe she was feeling exactly what you were .
maybe she didn &apos;t know how to put it into words .
maybe she was just freaked out .
maybe it was all too much for her .
ruby .
don &apos;t make the same mistake i did .
don &apos;t wait until it &apos;s too late to tell someone how you feel .
you really think i should ?
there you are . hey , it &apos;s not safe here .
what are we gonna do now , snow ?
what we always do -- find a way to fix things .
but no one can wake dorothy up now .
well , i mean , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s entirely true .
well , who else can give her true love &apos;s kiss ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
maybe ... you .
what ?
ruby , you &apos;re my best friend .
i know you .
and i see how worried you are .
you can tell me .
you &apos;re right .
so , why are you standing here ?
why aren &apos;t you on the way to oz ?
true love is two @-@ way street ,
and dorothy i don &apos;t think feels the same .
why ? what makes you think that ?
she can not bailed on me back in oz .
so ?
love &apos;s -- love &apos;s a funny thing .
when i met charming , i hit him in the face .
people in love hurt each other all the time .
yeah , maybe . maybe .
but , uh , it &apos;s just ...
i &apos;ve never been so scared about anything before .
that &apos;s a great sign &apos; cause love is freaking scary .
i &apos;m about to say goodbye to david
for what might be a really , really long time .
and you know why i &apos;m okay with it ?
because what you get back
when you love someone far outweighs the risk .
all right , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll try .
whew . ready .
put these on .
think of where you want to go .
then click your heels three times .
david , you should take her hand and hold tight .
so , i guess this is goodbye .
we have done this before , we can do it again .
when you get home , tell neal that i will be there
as fast as i can .
well , i was actually hoping that
you could tell him that for me .
david , you know i can &apos;t leave .
now you can .
what ?
i removed your name from the headstone .
am i missing something ?
emma already tried that .
yeah , and it didn &apos;t work .
because you tried to erase the names .
the rule down here is simple --
a life for a life .
so , i traded mine for yours .
david !
no , no .
if one of us gets to go home and see our son ,
it should be you .
how did you know to do this ?
simple , love .
hades overlooked one thing during my escape --
he enchanted my hand to carve these markers in the first place .
i can &apos;t erase the names , but i can change them .
come on . our boy waits for you .
um ... i was ready for you to go .
no , it &apos;s better this way .
you can look after him , and if storybrooke &apos;s in trouble ,
there &apos;s no better leader than snow white .
you sure ?
go to our son .
go home .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
mom , i &apos;m not very good at goodbyes .
i know . it runs in the family .
snow , while you &apos;re up there ,
will look in on roland for robin hood .
i know he &apos;d want me to ask you that .
of course . tell him not to worry .
ready ?
let &apos;s go find dorothy .
hello , hades .
zelena .
well , you &apos;re the last person i expected to show up here .
little chat with the bookworm made me realize ...
maybe i haven &apos;t given you a fair chance .
well , you &apos;re just in time to see this .
auntie em . freshly bottled today .
all that trouble to punish one moldy old aunt .
well , with the old lady gone , dorothy has no one ,
and i know how much you hate that girl .
she came to my chamber .
she tried to make me take a nap .
so i did something much worse .
dorothy &apos;s gonna be asleep forever .
what do you get out of it ?
other than your happiness ?
hm , nothing .
really ?
this was all for me ?
i know this is hard for you to believe ,
but that &apos;s why i did it --
to show you it &apos;s possible to be selfless .
you &apos;re scared i &apos;m going to disappoint you , aren &apos;t you ?
terrified .
i think that &apos;s a chance i &apos;m just going to have to take .
let &apos;s start ...
by toasting to dorothy &apos;s eternal slumber .
what is it , toto ?
ruby ! snow .
you found her .
i &apos;ve been waiting for you to get back .
she &apos;s under ...
a sleeping curse , i know .
thank you for taking care of her .
i &apos;ve had some experience with sort of thing .
ruby , you can do this .
go .
wolfie ?
kansas .
you left without saying anything .
i was afraid .
i couldn &apos;t lose you to zelena .
well , yeah , but i almost lost you .
you didn &apos;t .
you came back for me .
i always will .
after what hades did , we have to hit back and hard .
aye , love , but how ?
grandpa .
i thought you &apos;d like to see the latest .
grandma made it back to storybrooke .
thanks , kid .
now let &apos;s go figure out how to join them .
what is it ?
snow -- she made it .
belle , where have you been ?
trying to find a way to fix your mistake .
so have i.
doing research -- this is gonna take some time .
which is exactly what we don &apos;t have .
hades can take our baby whenever he wants to
just like emma did to zelena .
well , i won &apos;t let that happen .
i can &apos;t take the chance that you &apos;ll stop him in time ,
not when there &apos;s a way that i cause pause everything --
even my pregnancy .
where did you get that ?
from zelena , but don &apos;t worry .
the sleeping curse , it &apos;ll halt everything .
i can prick my finger quicker than you can stop me .
as long as i &apos;m asleep , hades can &apos;t take the baby ,
and you &apos;ll have all the time you need
to destroy the contract .
belle , you &apos;re only gonna make things worse .
i &apos;m doing what i need to to protect our child .
there &apos;s only one way out of a sleeping curse --
true love &apos;s kiss .
i know .
you think this is gonna force me
to become the man you want me to be ?
to go back to the light just to wake you up ?
my love , i already told you -- i &apos;m not that man .
no . i know .
you &apos;re not the one who &apos;s going to wake me , rumple .
my father is .
oh , no , belle , please don &apos;t -- don &apos;t --
after you destroy the contract ,
you do whatever it takes to get me back to him .
no !
oh , belle .
no , no , no .
