Letting it out is better
...than having to tell the cops you didn't mean to hug her to death.
Well, that's why you take it beforehand,
...so you don't get sick. It's prophylactic.
He's neck-deep in fraud and if anything goes down,
...they'll come after you first!
The money you stole from ServiceCircuit?
I don't know anything about that.
Because if you did empty those accounts,
...you're the one going down, not me.
More like the toilet. But the potential's there... we could make it work.
So is everybody like hot-hot Phil in your family,
...or are most of them like you?
But you need to lay off that until your cholesterol's down. Why not turkey?
Firing you is the least of it.
The only reason you're not going to prison...
He said there's something nasty going around, and you should take one, too.
It can't be the sex... you were a lot nicer and your hair was more shiny.
I'll take a stab and say it's because you realized feng shui is bullshit.
These nipples look like they've done hard time in Africa feeding a village.
I am not sleeping with him! And the fact you think I would, really hurts!
But what about the people who try to work it out? Maybe that's an option.
Hacked into his computer the night she was supposed to have sex with him.
Instead, he's totally fine and I'm sitting here with the two of you...
I'm a 34-inch waist. The fit doesn't have to be perfect. I like blue.
so you made a straitjacket and a pillow fort to protect yourself from me.
is that he should be the one freaking out, not me. I didn't do anything.
Which is fitting, as obviously I don't know anything going on in his life.
You girls think you can shake me down for all my money, you're crazy.
you won't lose your shit like you did with me. Don't say you didn't.
So what? Maybe you just have to forgive people in order to move forward.
That's a $300,000 car, asshole!
I guess you can afford it, then.
And you know what? It's about to happen again, so if you don't mind...
He's always going to wind up on top because he's a killer and I'm not.
Who cares? Where else has he traveled? Please don't tell me Thailand.
You must hate me so much. If it's any consolation, I hate me more.
And to relieve the pressure, they had to cut out a chunk of his skull.
We were going to hold off for prom, but we just got carried away.
If he's not seeing you... I'm so sorry I said that, that sucks...
I'm saying everything fails eventually and monogamy is not natural.
I quit my job so we could focus on his job. I put off having kids...
I found this... wire transfer instructions for a company in the Bahamas.
No. I said it was next week last week, which means it's this week.
because now sex is off the table... we have to speak to one another,
Try living under the same roof with him. All I get is surprise penis.
He's stealing, Kate. Making money for them is the way he does it.
I know Mark is at the One and Only.
Perfect, we're halfway there!
No jinxies. I get it. It's good that Mark doesn't have a nickname.
No. When you have a body like that, everything fits you perfectly.
That can't be right. Mark was talking about ServiceCircuit last night.
He used you to create the company and put everything in your name.
were for ServiceCircuit. Guess whose signature is all over them?
I did, because I was a mistress-virgin and you were the first.
No, no, no. We are not hiring a hooker to sleep with my husband.
Yeah, I remember. Sorry about your urn. What are you doing here?
Oh, please! Every relationship I've ever had, something felt off.
Look what I found. This is a list of all the start-up companies...
This is Cece. Kate's the one who had the idea for SwipeSwitch.com.
It's bullshit. It's bullshit! Global bullshit! I call bullshit!
What if the top part of me hated him, while the bottom part of me...
It's not always a wreck. Stan and I were married when we met.
What if he's calling to say he loves you and wants to be with you?
It's okay. The wine hit me wrong... I have a splitting headache.
but if we want it on video, I need a different court reporter.
He's not a donor kidney.
It's not the organ I was thinking of.
Uh, I couldn't read the menu because I left my glasses at Nina's.
You know when you just feel like, "Normal clothes are blah..."
Okay, great, come on. Let's get in the car. Come on, come on.
We think Mark has another mistress... we're going to find her.
If you had something to lose, you'd understand how hard this is.
Have you packed? I want to get on the road before traffic starts.
Call me when you're done being pissed.
That might be a while.
Not all. Just half. That's what equal partners get... 50%.
What? From her?! Is this some kind of joke? You're firing me?
I am not a mistress. A mistress knows she's dating a married man.
What do you want me to say? I get more ass than a toilet seat!
You sure the window doesn't open?
No. You're gonna be fine.
I would expect that from other guys in their offices, but not you.
and that I care about your problems... but guess what? I don't.
Things shifted this weekend. It was different. You don't know.
That's your Evil Genius smile. Is somebody about to get screwed?
Mark's invested in. Three are offshore and one's a blind filing.
And she does nothing. Just lays around the house all day long.
I don't care about you or Mark or your marriage or your dog.
And no matter how many women you sleep with, or cars you buy...
If you're having a panic attack, go outside and get some air.
What is this? Why does it say zero? Why's that even on here?
It's over. I'm getting my ideas direct from the factory now.
Don't you have a job?! Or hobbies?! What is wrong with you?!
This is a... one-day-at-a-time operation. Today is light recon day.
It's boring stuff from the accountant. ServiceCircuit again.
And I feel like an idiot for trusting you over him. I am done!
But sadly, I had to empty those accounts, so you're broke.
No, I'm not jealous. I just don't have an insane girl crush.
But if you can't, I suggest you get a game plan and leave.
If you can live with that, like the French, then stay put.
Micromacks? I thought Dave Cohen was handling this merger.
This window. Just open it a little. Crack it. Just crack it.
I have soft hands and a small mouth. I will be the bottom!
She's kind of troubled. But you smell amazing. What is that?
did all the dirty work? What if he just put it in halfway...
Put on something sexy, get your ass out to Connecticut...
We'll have the whole weekend in the Hamptons to work that out.
When you're divvying up friends in the divorce, keep this one.
You told me you'd get a divorce and we'd move to Tuscany.
You're so amazing, to be friends with your husband's mistress.
I don't think we should rush into anything. What are you doing?
Every time I look through binoculars, he has another mistress.
But I didn't want to show up empty-handed, so I brought food.
No, you were right about everything. And he's still lying to me.
I can't. If I'm investigating him or I go to the Bahamas...
Nothing. I just think it's more complicated than we thought.
Like a triangle of his skull, they cut it right out of his head...
In Connecticut. "With the Canadian crew." Which is code.
You'll take it off and it'll just be something you used to wear.
I don't want to make license plates!
You won't go to jail.
I don't call a boyfriend back after I find out he has a wife.
Did you know she was his mistress when she was in the house?
She's doing all of the stuff, the feng shui... in the house.
We're out of air. It's hot in here. Just crack the window.
to confirm that you and he were still on for drinks with "Mark."
It's completely crazy, and I don't know where it's going...
I thought I would come here and you would tell me I was crazy.
Don't come at me with all your... weird little man logic, OK?
Right. See? See? That's why I need to go to brain camp.
First, one was mine, so that doesn't count. Second of all.
We thought you might say that. Then Carly explained...
I was going crazy without you. I'm sorry for being a jerk.
You can't. There's too much morning sun. It would blast you.
I still think I'm not ready to compete with women like you.
I told you that before you married him. What a piece of shit!
about it, I'm going to go crazy... for real. Like, really.
Wait! What am I supposed to do? You can't just leave me.
You wouldn't get dressed, so I buttoned you in backwards.
Think of it as payback. That's how we framed it with Nick.
And if I was Ray Charles, I would actually be blind and...
Oh, my God, I am so sorry. I can't believe I said that.
You made us a ton of money this year. Nobody bats a thousand.
It's like his sex drive is tripled.
Non-stop, right?
So, what's up? What's this big mystery you want me to solve?
I went to China! Do you have any idea how far away China is?
Yes. We're celebrating. Just let me clean up real quick.
A pipe burst in his house and he went back to Connecticut.
It's already hooked.
Come on. It's barely in the red!
I just want to talk. I thought we could have some dinner?
Why is he calling you at all?
I don't know that, either.
I'll tell you what my mother told me... words to live by.
and then I took a really hot bath after and really cleaned up?
Why can't he stuff it into a tube sock like a normal guy?
She's 24, a dance major. I eat anything she tells me to.
It must be big. You were crazy about him two days ago.
But if I play against John McEnroe, I expect to lose.
I'll tell what you do... look for blind offshore filings.
Okay, I'll tell you anything you want if you just leave.
Fine. Rock, paper, scissors. Winner has sex with my husband.
Well, well. Look who's here... the wife and the mistress.
You have the perfect place, and you are the perfect girl...
Get Dave on the phone. I need all pertinent materials...
You're overreacting.
They're straight out of the Congo!
What's this guy do?
He develops start-up companies.
whatever happens between you and Mark is your business.
And every time I flushed the toilet, the shower got cold?
You wanted to be friends, too. You just didn't know it.
The girl at the shop told me that sheer is the next big thing.
No. And I feel like if Amber won't talk to me, then...
I don't even know if she's American. I don't even know.
If you're going to cave every time he pays attention to you...
It just seems like everything was so simple then. You know?
I'm the CEO. I'm the CEO of several companies, actually.
That wasn't a shitty apartment. That was a great apartment.
I've been dating for decades! I don't need this anymore!
Didn't you notice our skin? That nice Bahamian glow?
Listen, Mark's shady. He finds out you have a lawyer,
What are you doing?
Seeing if Mark wants to hang out.
And though Mark's an asshole, they had something real.
And if you work it out, he's just going to do it again.
So let me get this straight. I came into your bed naked...
Because you know how I get carried away with all the colors...
I can't join a gang! I don't know how to make shanks!
My situation's pretty situated at all times, it's true.
You're being a very negative detective. Give me a boost up.
You are innocent in all this. Let's go back to Phil's.
You deserve something different, something better than that.
It'll be so hot. I think it'd be a game changer for us.
I'm sorry, honey. Tonight's not good. I gotta work.
Well, not me! So he must be cheating on both of us.
Oh, he's wearing those cute shorts I got him for Christmas.
If I was going to "lose" money, that's where I'd do it.
You will thank me for using a fake name. You want Phil...
Miss Whitten asked if you would wait in the conference room.
You know what? Why don't I meet you after your meeting?
I don't want to sit someplace where you and Mark had sex.
but if he isn't seeing you, he's seeing someone else.
I'll drive in to meet you in the city after your meeting!
and you could probably take off all your clothes right now...
You screw me, I screw you back. I'm a lady like that.
I don't want to keep explaining this. Carmela is Carly!
You won't get away with this. You won't get away with this!
Jesus, that was... I think that might have been his balls.
and what's happening, 'cause I can't take it anymore!
It's you who's liable. So don't threaten me, honey.
Katie, if she's full of shit, call her out on it.
someone gets bored and unhappy and is saying it's over.
She doesn't even know that I know they're still together.
Yeah. I just wanted to clear the air, and say that...
you know how Mark does everything, and Amber knows...
No, this is where I would want to exist, right here...
and has to go on dates. I am not equipped to go on dates.
What? You robbed me. You three girls robbed me.
which was swelling, and his head would have just exploded.
Picking up my phone is like being flashed on the subway.
and he had his computer with him.
Did you have sex?
That's probably why you're wrapping up divorce number five
He's going through so much with this divorce, and...
Mark's not just a cheating scumbag. He's also a thief.
You know what? It just looks like you're a little bloated.
A pipe burst in the bathroom... I have to go handle it.
I did say that, but nothing I ever told you was true.
Have a seat, but please keep your dog off of my furniture.
You included Nick? Bullshit! Now I know you're...
What are you talking about? Do you know what she means?
This may sound wrong, but I kind of want him to hurt.
No board of directors, a P.O. box for an address...
No! No, you can't have my husband and my brother!
I would love to, but it's kind of a tricky project...
I care so much, and then it just comes out so harsh.
It's how he handled it.
You're just being paranoid.
What happened to Model Man Boy and Dr. Not So Smart...?
You don't get to walk out. You don't get to ice me out.
And when I get this feeling, I'm usually always right.
Does this window open?
No, and for good reason.
I come here because it's like a hobby that pays well.
No, 'cause then I have to go home and deal with Mark.
Ignore her. She's working through some stuff right now.
Yes, Kate. Exactly like that. I shit my pants.
little apartment on Charles Street that we'd end up here?
What is your deal? Do you not get how weird this is?
And you're calling him Mark? You never use their names!
I'm so glad you're here. We have so much to tell you!
and I just want to stay in our bubble a little longer.
double-D, natural double-D.
A triple-D.
Put the Lawyer, the Wife and the Boobs together...
I got to. There's two feet of water in my basement.
I thought you were giving him hormones.
I am!
we're thinking about something a little bigger than that.
They seem really happy. Mark is making them rich!
It means he's still viable. You haven't rejected him.
Though we did have to significantly reduce your share.
I'm really okay. Thank you. I hate being touched.
Phil went for a run and Amber's making frittatas.
and she is going to take half of it! It's not fair.
Okay, one more. A couple, maybe. Uh... three.
How do you feel?
I don't know. How do you feel?
No, we can't keep her! We have a dog at home!
Why don't you come to my investor dinner this weekend?
Deal with her. And then deal with the real problem.
Ah! I haven't seen her. We didn't have that twinkle.
That reminds me, I need you to sign these, honey.
We ran on the beach, met Mark's new mistress...
What? Again? This is the third night this week!
The best thing to do is just not think about it too hard.
We'll go to that hot chocolate place in the morning.
The worst part about this is, you seem so nice...
That marriage was doomed, so it wasn't cheating.
He said you cheated on him, then asked for a divorce.
I'm wearing these glasses because I look like shit.
What's it called?
"No Hands." Isn't it great?
The point of being pretty is that you don't have to.
Don't make fun of 'Nam. Best years of my life.
and on top of it, I have to get my ducks in a row.
Wow. You haven't dated just one guy in a long time.
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you'd have your phone off.
nothing will be enough to fill the hole inside you...
Okay. Are you all packed for your business meetings?
Oh, you know, sometimes I like to put on my dress.
I just thought maybe we could talk, because I, um...
That's funny, neither did I. But apparently...
He made me the bad guy. And he's divorcing me?
Let me tag along for a drink. You said I'd like it.
You can't care for yourself unless you toughen up.
But if two million doesn't work, we shut it down.
I'm really sorry. I thought I had him that time.
then let's take him down. We have him surrounded.
How long have you and my husband been seeing each other?
Where are we? Seriously. What is this, Saigon?
She's like a cliche of every wife's waking nightmare!
Even if you meet a nice guy... and by "nice..."
got a worm that made his brain swell up super fast.
That is so... Okay. That's... What an asshole!
And I honestly do not know what I'm going to do at all!
As long as it works, it doesn't really matter why.
I don't think so. I've kind of been in the zone here.
soul-sucking, life-ruining face crater that you...
I can give you the names of three different lawyers.
Family comes first. I'll see you when I get back.
Thank you for everything. I really appreciate it.
He's going to have to give this woman half his money.
...but you looked so sad when I won, I couldn't.
and it's been operating at a total loss in the Bahamas.
Don't get too close to me. I think I'm getting sick.
At some point you say... I play tennis, right?
Just think of that next time you eat pig bacon.
Barb Melman got divorced and now she has...
then he comes to me, "Oh, I have to go golfing."
I started digging around. Everything was locked.
I'm going to go see if our toilet can take a punch.
he has the perfect woman. What else would he need?
You know how I told you to get your ducks in a row?
No, no, no, no, no! Are you kidding me? No!
cheek implants and lives in a condo in Norwalk...
That's because I have a Stan, okay? He works.
I say it's our turn to take this shit international.
about a guy who ate an undercooked pork chop and...
that number at the bottom is your joint net worth.
Sorry. You're right. We barely know each other.
He's just on a high from the business trip and...
They're going to put in half a million as seed money.
She needs freakin' brain camp! That's my money!
And the Hot Rabbi's Cousin?
Cut them loose.
What about your father?
Leave Dad out of this!
If you want to have sex with your husband, do it
What do you want me to do?
Go to Connecticut.
One night, and you go back to being a Stepford?
You're not working with hypothetical Feds, are you?
Seriously, can you please say I'm not a mistress?
You cleared the roster.
I cleared the bench.
You can't ice me out. I'm going to ice you out.
You have to admit, that's pretty good. Seriously.
need this dog, so thanks for making no sense.
What's it like? Is it like a '70s situation?
You want to know the truth? Your husband sucks!
Okay, what are we looking for? What's the clue?
I'm sorry, did you say you had a fecal incident?
You're his fall guy!
You could go to jail!
while pretending not to know about his whores...
Have I made mistakes? Yes. Big ones. Huge ones.
That's the good news! Your name's on everything.
Well, I don't know how much longer I can last...
We'll get your number.
Can we keep her?
but she's spying on me, like a double agent.
I think you're being greedy.
I'm being greedy?
No need to read it... it's just the usual stuff.
and not "friend friend," like "boning friend!"
You need a guy with something to keep him busy.
because I couldn't crack the code on his password.
That dog is trying to break me.
He really is.
Has he talked to you like that, or has he...?
Oh, my God, that's it! He's cheating on us!
He could pick any scenario, and he picks that?
You're the wife! He's supposed to cheat on you!
I fee like I owe you an apology for the other night.
So forget all this bullshit and go surprise him.
And that's a happy ending. A shitty ending...
You just have to pick a spot and be okay with it.
Does this mean he's not training for the marathon?
Okay, but when you sleep with that many people...
I think we just broke up.
No! How come?
Let me just...
Wait. How are you doing that?
And what do you plan on doing if you find this girl?
I'm having fun. Not a lot of it, but some.
He's a liar, Kate. Who cares what he says?
You have money. You have half of what Mark has.
I would have never known that I needed to change.
you have a threesome, I don't flipping care!
That's not the point. I don't do married guys.
Look, I don't know if you're here out of...
We bonded over dim sum and spatial reasoning.
They didn't tell me anything. They showed me.
Um, I found your number in my husband's phone.
I'm sorry, baby. I have to take a rain check.
Carly. Carmela. You're talking about Carmela.
No, I was setting the mike. What do you want?
But I think a married guy is a perfect fit for you.
I already read it for us. You just have to sign.
I need like at least a week of prep, minimum.
Oh, honey? I need you to sign some papers for me.
Okay, target is moving! Target is on the move.
And then one day that ring will just be a ring.
Oh, oh, oh! Hey! Hey! Hey, buddy! I'm here! Stop!
...let's never sleep with the same guy again.
You can waste your own time, but I'm done.
This place is awesome. My neck was so tight.
What do I do? Now I'm Barb Melman?
Then why call me? For permission?
No!
Stan's wife was fat, with no sexual charisma.
Let me tell you something about Martha Stewart.
Not that you're a whore! You're not a whore.
Once you meet my dad and I meet your friends,
it's not a mistake, honey. It's pathological.
I'm wondering, what if I keep my clothes on...
and you're just like, "I wish I had a costume!"
I don't do this. I'm too old for this shit.
It's too late for that.
Please don't do this.
Here, you want this? I'm switching to vodka.
Bill, I told you, don't call me at night!
We waited for someone to leave and then snuck in.
That's so smart and funny! That's really witty.
Amber got Mark's password off the nanny cam.
He's your brother. What would you do with him?
You don't see me worrying about my job, do you?
Maybe you should ask her about ServiceCircuit.
I'm gonna do it.
If you do it, I do it.
He can't have sex till he finishes his Z-Pak!
I got all that out of my system with that one.
I can't believe I'm in the mistress's closet.
It's just that you were going to meet my dad...
By the way, what is up with your hot brother?
You don't have it in you to rip me off. No way.
You're so funny! You'll see when you meet her.
Is this some kind of stripper-gram or something?
I want him to feel what I feel, but worse.
So can I ask, what the hell are you two up to?
Sorry. It's me. Don't be mad. I just...
Plus, I'm traveling to Miami and the Bahamas.
Stop the grappling! I'm strong when I'm mad!
Well, I'm not working. And I am so freaking hot.
Do you want me to wait for you? I don't mind.
Hi, can I help you?
I can help you!
he banks, so let's go to the Bahamas...
I'll do it. I don't have a lot of feelings.
Very soft skin. We met at Trader Joe's.
is because your wife paid all the money back.
You look gorgeous today.
Thanks, honey.
She makes me look like I'm wearing a diaper!
Well, I was sorry to hear about you and Julie.
Well, shit! I don't know! All I know is what
I don't hate you. I don't hate you at all.
You took off your clothes to go skinny dipping.
I'm saying that if you want to take him down...
I never liked that guy. I never liked him.
No! Of course not. It's barely dark outside.
Yeah, I do, because he used to touch me, too.
I was out for a jog and my hammies locked up.
Oh, my God! Did you do it more than ten times?
You okay, baby? You need my help on this?
Let's go! He's probably halfway there already!
This is just so unoriginal, Mark! So cliche!
Or did Big Pussy and Meadow miss you too much?
I'm pretty sure that's why he's still calling.
haven't been here since I bought the place.
I mean that he's not an obvious sociopath...
The guys on the Canadian deal wanna do dinner.
You know it's not actually happening, right?
It just felt so good to be touched, you know?
I don't need to wreck someone's home for a date.
I'm taking him to obedience school today.
white shirts and thin turkey and all that...
So you're talking about maximum pain, right?
And I just wanted you to be happy.
I am.
You won't see anything through those hedges.
Obviously, but which one?
The only one.
Yes. And have you ever seen shit like this?
Because I said so. Why, do you like her?
There's someone here to see you... Kate King.
Mark's.
No! Yours! You're the CEO.
If we're going to do this, I need a drink.
And I started thinking, maybe he is shady.
You got to stretch it out. Stretch it out.
Like what, a cheating husband of my own?
It's really nice, what you're doing for her.
But he didn't ask for forgiveness, did he?
He's supposed to be with Amber!
Shit!
Ray Charles over here tried to pass herself off.
Though technically, I have been competing
Is this some Tyler Durden Fight Club thing?
in that too-horrible-to-be-true kind of way.
I like the way your brain works, but...
what I'm doing with all your great ideas.
You'll like it. Come on. I'll show you.
It's your signature all over those contracts.
I mean, do you think that he still loves me?
Empty? What are you talking about? How...?
No! You can't get in there. I'm ticklish.
Okay, we're done here. I'm going to do it.
He must have literally screwed your brains out!
Yeah, that's me... Mistress of the Year.
Are you okay? I've been trying you all day!
I started redecorating. What do you think?
is really throwing me into an all-American rage.
We just need to find the bank he's using.
This is putting your ducks in a wood chipper!
Well, this isn't putting your ducks in a row.
That's what happens when you piss people off.
No. The client said he was too emotional.
You know what? Screw it. I'm coming home.
Don't worry, you look good.
Thanks.
If Edith Piaf rises out of the grave and
Mark's in Miami. Why is he calling you?
it turns out they're still seeing each other.
try not to make that part any worse for her.
And where in the story does he act like a jerk?
"Do what you need to do. I support you"?
I went to the doctor. He gave me a Z-Pak.
I can't stay in this Mark moment forever.
and he had me believing you were the devil.
Why? They're the first things you see.
No, no. You know what? I overreacted.
'cause I'm not certain I really like you yet.
Where they give you exercises for your brain?
Want to know who Nina is?
Not really.
But the lawyers say it's all very amicable.
Okay, hold on one second. Just one second.
Step down. Step down. Okay, there you go.
This is not okay. I am part of Team King.
You're so much better now.
Thank you.
I did not think that I would be right at all.
You're not a whore.
Let's go outside.
Don't say it's a social call, because you
They were all flings, and they knew it.
each other's hair and drinking Cosmos.
He saw the dog and drew his own conclusions.
I shouldn't have told you. I'm so sorry.
Did you ever think when we had that shitty
with women like you and just didn't know it.
He's up!
Really? What's he doing?
You sure? You're talking to your phone.
whole room is filled with lies and secrets.
You pulled my hair, which is totally...
I feel bad for you. Let me walk you out.
and gross and I don't want to do that!
Oh! And we need a check for the painter, too.
Sorry. Do you mind? I'll just be a sec.
As far as talking to someone who won't blab,
No! I can't go to work with my tits taped!
Try these on. These ones are very special.
One kiss and good-bye. Okay, that was it.
Kate, you remember my partner, Nick.
So I'm just gonna stay in the city tonight.
Don't be mad.
I'm not being anything.
I can't defend you if I know you did it.
No. No. You can't...
What? What?
No! Do you have a problem with the Feds?
I don't know why men find these sexy.
No, we can't. If you have any questions
wishing you'd left the first time around.
and I think he's getting a little suspicious.
but for your sake, I hope you're lying.
Where are you going?
To do push-ups.
Mark was able to lead a whole other life
I'm Carly. You must be his housekeeper.
We're not in competition. We got played
I know how assholes do asshole-y things...
Oh, my God! I am obsessed with that idea.
But that's just me. He's your husband.
I thought she was his ex-mistress, but...
mentioning your new friend Carly to Mark?
I don't know! There's been wine, and...
The one thing we're not giving him... sex.
Did you just say something about the Bahamas?
I will wind up in gen pop. Turn around.
There's got to be a little latch or something.
For basically forcing me to be your friend.
Wake up. You're making out with your dog.
my zipper just got caught on my necklace.
You saw him?
He came over after work
I was crazy to think we could be friends.
Maybe one of us should sleep with him.
No, I'm telling you something feels off.
I feel like I need to go to brain camp.
They wanted a ruthless law robot, so...
but there's something very wrong with that.
I mean, has he ever said he loves you?
No, I can see you. Go out the window.
No. You think he's an evil sociopath.
On that happy note, who needs a drink?
Feng shui is good 'cause it's important...
They're having some kind of group breakdown.
Lives a couple of streets over on Clark.
Somebody's being negative. I'm gonna go.
It's not your fault I married a monster.
You mostly just yelled at me the whole time.
Okay, you know what? Feng shui rules.
Think about it. Between the two of us...
And I hate that you keep saying it's dumb!
I can't talk to you until you stop crying.
Oh, no! You're going to Connecticut now?
I chickened out and said I had Chlamydia!
Wow! Thank you. That really means a lot.
You, too. I hope I see you again soon.
Well, it's going to suck for a little while.
and have no flab and not need a wax...
Oh, hell, no! Now he's crossed the line!
So you haven't called him, full silent
He'll look at the office while you go.
I didn't know, so I'm not a mistress.
I'll see if he can meet tomorrow night.
Well, if we don't leave until tomorrow,
He ain't losing money, he's robbing it.
The last time I was single, I was 24
It's not like I cared about any of them.
Are you still sleeping with my husband?
If you weren't as disgusting as you were...
And I get first dibs on what's in the bag.
Incredible.
He didn't even notice!
I needed some pants and the only person
Done? That wasn't even a conversation.
Maybe we should have a drink and talk.
you become the enemy. If he thinks...
Sometimes I can be more tough than love.
You're his soul mate. I'm a whore.
I might not always get it right, but...
about your husband, you should ask him.
I heard, and he's meeting somebody!
Now I'm all worn in like an old glove.
And then divorces me for fake-cheating?
You should think about being nicer to me...
The guys loved your gift card swap idea.
You think we could let a sister down?
You had sex with my husband fifty times?!
Oh, baby, send me a picture, will you?
I get it. Things are coming into focus.
But if you want to talk, we can. Sure.
Hi. I'm Kate. I met you on Friday.
now I'm totally serious, like... not...
Huh, could this day get any worse? Really?!
you know how sometimes you get like a...
what we're doing, where we're going...
You're saying I should stay with him.
I wish he stopped sending me pictures!
And when she's done running around with you,
Oh. You're not a mistress.
Thank you.
She's not a hooker. She's just a slut.
He's a contractor.
Oh, a contractor.
Good-bye.
Fine. Forget I called.
I'll get us some drinks. Scotch okay?
Then cry on the inside, like a winner.
Doesn't Mark see you naked all the time?
Let's say I was hedging my willpower.
Um. I'll send you a check for your urn.
Oh, there it is... the end of the road.
Oh, well, I would, but I'm pretty sure...
No, don't go just yet. Just one kiss.
Maybe I should just tell him in person.
I don't think we have the same size foot.
When that happens, I have to stretch.
He can't give away what he doesn't have.
You could go lay on a beach and get tan
Does this open? The window? Anywhere?
So you needed the pillows to resist me.
We'll get dressed up and you can see...
I heard him on the phone with her...
You girls started in on the tequila...
He's still treating me like I'm blind.
You know, what the hell do you know?
It's like a midlife crisis mistress!
I think you're being hard on yourself.
in order to make yourself feel better.
Just to let some steam out of the pot.
What happened to just painting it red?
Okay, but you're not going to like it.
or anything. Just like a fig leaf.
Kate might actually have a point about
You're calling because you got a zit?
and you ambush Prince Charming's wife.
No. Please keep the lid on the pot.
It was like this red mist came over me.
Oh, by the way, your dad called...
You and your vagina need to just...
That's what he said? That I cheated?
Except for Carly. We were exclusive.
of age-appropriate men who are old...
Yeah. I couldn't be more okay. What?
he's lying to me and sleeping with you.
They should have that for your brain.
Don't mention the whole mistress thing.
morbid curiosity, or you and Kate
You think he has more than one here?
because it's just a matter of time before
I can't believe you're not interested.
my friends are Mark's friends...
We are. The weirdest friends ever.
You come back and you're super smart.
My wife's not some criminal mastermind.
and I don't want to complicate things.
Just pulled over for a little stretch.
and I like to think I'm a good guy, so...
And if I keep talking to myself...
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Feng shui is not what you think it is!
Stop frowning before you break your face.
He has a wife, okay? He's married.
I really thought we were soul mates.
who didn't try to rob me was a hipster.
What's wrong with you?
Everything!
And we had the bathroom in the kitchen?
Why do I schedule breakfast meetings?
Oh, no, no, no. You're all lying.
I would put a coffee table right here...
I-I got to go. I got to go, baby.
It's gingko biloba. Balboa was Rocky.
That can't be right. It's a trick!
while we're having sex?
Really?
If I let you in, we are not braiding
ServiceCircuit. This is it, Kate.
That's not true. You're not alone.
He has been working his whole life...
I'm sorry. I had no idea. I swear.
Did you and Tony enjoy Hong Kong?
Who's Mark?
The guy I'm seeing.
he's got that look in his eyes, that...
We met in Hong Kong. I told you.
I know exactly what I would do with it.
Does that hurt? Tune in Tokyo. -Ah!
so I could have my morning coffee.
Let's get into the car. Be very careful.
I had a little Edith Piaf moment...
I'm sorry.
Oh, I feel so awful.
I just don't know if I can hold out.
I want out of the loop! Take me out.
I wouldn't even be me without you.
I can't even remember to shave my legs.
I'm really happy we're doing this.
Then what, you pull out my weave?
From now on, you have to tell me
You should go. I'll call you later.
you're clueless, you have an edge.
Big year. Great job.
Thanks.
The skull was holding his brain...
Oh, just some stuff for the accountant.
I can't go to jail! No, no, no.
You're worried about him.
I am.
I can go with you. That'd be fun.
and they'll blab! You are literally
Only young, hot girls drive Jettas!
You said we just had to find out where
Forget what?
Dinner with Phil.
Otherwise, his brain would have...
That's the best part of the house.
I don't know what's going on with you,
there's a difference between having sex
Then it's going to suck a little less.
I know that you think it's that bad,
Oh, boo-hoo! He cheated on me, too!
We need to find Mark and his bank.
This looks like a box of bungee cords.
This is what happens when Carly makes
Well, I heard a story on the news...
I can't believe he was cheating on me!
and they implanted it in his groin...
It's not a big deal. It's very new.
Did you just start sleeping together?
or anything and just be ready to go.
I think I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Mark, you're not a very nice person.
Okay, fine. Gun to my head...
Hey, Nick! Hey, man! I... What?
And though it brought us together,
I was with the board last night.
What are you doing? What is that?
Don't do this, Kate. I love you.
you have a perfect killing machine.
Just promise when you meet her...
Those bank transfers you gave me...
If you killed him, don't tell me.
They're putting more money into it.
I have no friends to talk to because
That's how you run a double agent.
Come on, let's get you in the car.
A lot.
I don't want to hear that.
We'll find out what Amber knows.
You'll end up back where you started,
I can't wait for the site to go up.
I can change. You can help me.
who knows what's happening besides me!
Oh, my God, I've hit rock bottom.
I'll tell you all about it at dinner.
Ah, the Chuzzlewit Pinch.
You can tell me. I won't be mad.
Because my whole world just blew up
Can we get three punches, please?
The details do matter, because...
Is it ever going to get any easier?
I just can't believe he'd lie to me.
me cry on the inside like a winner!
friends that love every part of you.
Okay, let's go this way. All right.
so they don't have to wear glasses.
All right. If you really want to.
You slept with him, didn't you.
Well, it's not a big deal, but...
He's back to sexting like a freak.
I have so many lotions at the house.
We weren't happy. Now we are.
Are you okay?
Actually, no.
No, I really don't understand this.
Mmm-hmm. -I realized that with you.
We're adults. We had sex.
If we put our brains together...
That's like a really good thought, and
Mark, you're a real piece of shit.
Here you go. Thanks for the ride.
There are so many people in the world
She's the perfect ten lemon tart...
What a cute dress!
Thank you!
No, there's no room under the bed.
But it was really nice meeting you.
What it does is hold your tits up.
We valued everything you own, and...
We're getting the band back together.
Like in Switzerland or the Bahamas.
Affairs? You're looking at it.
What? Oh, yeah!
Don't do that.
And it's not all Hong Kong, either.
She told me about this naan bread.
I want a divorce, Mark.
No.
I don't think that's how it works.
You'll send me the lawyers' names?
She comes in peace, so be nice.
Your Indian girl didn't veto that?
because I took it away from him.
and it all went downhill from there.
if I wanted to protect my money
When did you start eating naan?
No. No. I have the wrong address.
I'm Carmela, Kate's decorator.
You mean he should hide his money?
And then I started thinking that this
He's taken this shit international!
I don't know what they told you.
Are you serious? It's a window!
Let me just lay down for a minute.
Things got really tough in here, huh?
doing the Benson depo on Tuesday...
with one of my sorority sisters.
Okay, turn around. Turn around.
by the same guy. I call it a tie.
Maybe I can make it go away, huh?
He said that... I was the cheater?
and a set of dates for deposition.
Hi, sweetie! You're home early!
because you think we're friends
You weren't going to mention these?
That's crazy.
It's a miracle.
Don't worry, we didn't hook up.
If we find any more mistresses,
the-awful-thing-doesn't-happen thing.
It brings up our group average.
You don't think you can take her?
Please focus.
I am focused!
are the weirdest friends ever...
You jumped out a window for me.
This isn't frickin' Sister Wives.
I'm not saying you have to be bald
You really like this guy, huh?
I don't know... a couple months.
Well, what if he's in love with you?
and the dating pool was everyone!
I need you to buy me some pants.
and in China who love feng shui.
one time and having sex ten times.
her bringing up the group average.
Okay. I'll keep you in the loop?
You don't think I can handle it?
That's right, bitch! Chlamydia!
I'm sorry. Um... where were we?
a pretty little patch of happiness.
One time, or two out of three?
You get it wrong all the time.
You know when you get like that?
It's not bullshit.
It is.
I can weather a little hate sex.
The say-the-awful-thing-so-that-
I have a friend who could do it.
When people have lazy eyes...
A Z-Pak? I'm not sick, though.
Milk? My husband prefers goat.
This is what it's come to, huh?
He is! But better me than you.
Good idea. Never.
Ever.
I think specifics are a bad idea.
We were pretty out of our heads,
just a hint of a zit and you...
We could just cuddle and sleep in.
Well, actually, the phone bill,
We should get out of here. Now.
I thought maybe we could talk?
but honestly, it's a lot worse.
and fix that young man's plumbing.
Okay, Fernando, go, go, go!
Anyway, speaking of changes...
Yeah, it's like a dream come true.
It is. But we can work it out.
She handled prison like a boss!
Put your foot down. Please go.
No! That's being very greedy.
I'm exactly where I want to be.
Kate, I'm sorry, but I can't.
Are you serious?
Or more!
You're sleeping with my husband?!
and I've been so worried about him.
treatment and he's still calling?
I think it's good she's super hot.
Mark King to see Miss Whitten.
We should kick him in the balls!
they become a part of this...
Mark is flying down this week.
If you could, do it today.
pick at it a little bit, and...
Enough for a pre-op transsexual.
I won't be back tomorrow night.
as a blind woman to get upstairs.
by "losing" it, what would I do?
How are you?
Not too great.
is that there's lying and cheating
then I'm still involved, and...
Next time, call a plumber.
I'm looking for a different Mark.
I canceled. What's all this?
I'm insecure. I have issues.
and I just can't do that anymore.
It's something that rhymes with...
Everything is wrong with you.
You have one hour.
Okay.
And you let her because...?
It looks like you put on weight.
No, you don't want to do that.
I can't even read these anymore.
This is me being done.
Fine.
Is that still circling the drain?
Why did you have your phone on?
she'll realize that's gone.
I didn't know he was in Miami.
Get away. Get away, get away!
You're sleeping with my husband?
You told me that was next week.
My husband likes this pasta.
can be just as shady as he can.
And what about meeting my dad?
obviously I did something wrong.
You still want those?
Yeah.
I think it's great.
You do?
I hate working on the weekends.
Stop, you crazy housewife!
Red or white what?
Wine.
but we just have that twinkle.
you can't get excited about it...
You guys have no faith in me.
I was keeping you in the loop.
I'll make a steak and salad...
But it's such an icebreaker.
It's already in the air, guy.
they get their eyes worked out
and drink gingko balboa all day.
No! I know I said I would,
My name's all over everything!
I'll have to send her to rehab.
who makes him start a new life
where something real should be.
I just started seeing someone.
pretending not to know you...
Yes! Hi. It's been ages.
hand-holding during dinner.
So fake it until you make it.
What?! You had sex with him?
She's my little idea factory.
a concept called restitution.
Okay, fine. She's beautiful.
Sorry, honey, not tonight.
Mark will be back any minute!
Now it's like a shallow puddle...
My husband likes a meaty sauce.
Right there. Twelve o'clock.
You are an empty man. -Mmm-hmm.
She's Mark's girlfriend...
You're welcome. Are we done?
Watch what I taught Thunder.
How do you know where I live?
You sure about that?
Yes!
I was thinking, what sucks...
She pretends to be my friend,
And I'm not.
You're not.
Shit, he's early.
Who?
And see, I am not situated.
I didn't. No, he's, um...
No! I kind of want one, too.
I did not expect this at all.
Who you sending the selfie to?
Oh, Mark.
Yes! Mark.
That'd be perfect, thank you.
Screw turkey. I like pig.
Where you going? Come here.
What happened to being calm?!
But, anyhow, I'm here.
It's like a... just not...
I wish. What are you doing?
Are they sensitive?
Yes.
You didn't forget, did you?
This is like a logic puzzle.
It would look so hot on you.
"Sorry for the tough love."
You know what?
Right?
I'll take one for the team.
How's it going?
Not good.
How'd you get in the building?
You think she had that made?
Okay, here's what happened.
You framed it with Nick, now?
That's what I'm talking about.
You shouldn't pay for that.
the only person in the world...
his head would have exploded.
The feng shui spatialist chick.
I'm usually a fun date. I am.
Really?
Yeah, really.
No, I'm his wife, Kate.
No, it's fine. It's good.
Here's to having friends...
You know what? I'll do it.
Get over. It's a step down.
We didn't? Oh, thank God.
Come on. You'll love Dana.
No, okay. I get it. Okay.
Can you say that, please?
How do you know he's here?
it tastes different today.
Nah. Don't worry about it.
I mean, maybe a little,
I don't even understand this.
to know where to place things
No problem. You're welcome.
This is a bag full of vomit.
You wrecked two marriages!
Why do you work so hard?
What does your gut tell you?
But her real name is Carly.
Did you want this smoothie?
What?
You heard me.
Is your shirt see-through?
I'll call you when I get in.
but the idea of worrying about
Look, he won't catch us.
Can you open the door for me?
Where are you going?! Wait!
Selfish people live longer
I am not Martha Stewart!
Send me the cleaning bill.
Since when do you smoke?
Like you pooped your pants?
Thanks. I appreciate it.
The details don't matter.
You sure you're not angry?
because he wasn't ready.
Really?!
That's right!
Since whenever I want to.
He must be taking Viagra.
You found it!
I did.
Gone.
The Hot Rabbi?
Baby, this is Dana. -Hmm?
Nothing from Amber, either?
That feels so much better.
She's lovely.
She is.
No. Not really.
No?
Let me just... I'm sorry.
No, you go see your dad.
Half of everything he has.
Actually, don't tell me.
What am I supposed to do?
And guess what?
What?
Thunder, get me a beer.
Not really.
Yes, I am!
I'm not going out the window!
I get it.
Get what?
You have us.
Exactly.
We looked. That's how.
Cheers.
Love you guys.
When did you fire Joel?
He'll love it.
Who?
I'm going to take a shower.
without you even noticing.
They just need to have...
Can I have another drink?
Ugh! Why do you say that?
Are you in?
I'm in!
I can't put my finger on it,
I have no money of my own!
Kate King is at security.
Remember how tiny it was?
We did it, we did it!
You know, I am like...
Yup. That's a lot better.
There is no Clark Street.
I must be. You are...?
And makes me the villain?
What do you need, Kate?
It's pretty.
You do?
For the bacon, I think.
I'm assuming you came here
I think it's just sweat.
Kate, what's going on?
Not technically, anyway.
No way! I don't buy it.
What the hell did you do?
So, how was the stalking?
Two of my favorite things.
Are you the famous Mark?
A grappling hook? Really?
Yes. Okay. Right. Mmm-hmm.
Indian girl. Beautiful.
Bloated? I have boobs!
Twenty-two, super hot.
Could you keep it down?
You're such a good girl.
That's part of the con.
Like fifty times at least.
Are you Carly?
No.
We can have so much fun!
No. So you're welcome.
Nah, I think I got it.
We're going to lose him.
An accident?
I know.
Get your ducks in a row.
I did. I really did.
Can I get some napkins?
Do you care if I smoke?
Let me see. Let me see!
you keep picking at it...
until it becomes this...
What? When I meet her?
but with big underpants.
Those look good on him.
I am done.
I'm done.
I think I see a dolphin!
It's a Jetta!
So?
But she's a good person.
Miss Whitten?
Yeah?
Hold on! Wait, wait!
and I don't have a job!
No, I didn't kill him.
Unless you want to stay.
I was kidding about that.
Really? Aw!
Really.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Cheaters don't change.
What's going on with you?
I got him! I got him!
I knew you'd love her!
Oh. -It's good, right?
I loved that apartment.
He's a short guy? Bald?
and tried to molest you,
You're making a mistake.
The housekeeper called.
What are you guys doing?
What do you want to do?
Good to see you again.
No one's going to jail.
And it's going to suck.
It's been eight weeks.
With who?
Carmela!
It doesn't matter anyway.
Or we can talk after.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love it.
Really?
Some food is right here.
All right. Come on in.
I had a fecal incident.
You're so full of shit.
Both of you, stop.
Because she is fired!
If I'm being honest...
Hi, Amber.
Hi.
Mark's cheating on you?!
Honestly, Katie...
Just tell me the truth!
So, how's Carmela?
Like, a brain camp.
Here's my ice shield.
I want to be the one...
I got Micromacks.
Because it's not fair.
I'm fine, thank you.
absolutely cannot hide?
You want me to get it?
A three-way?
Yeah.
And you smell so good.
Oh. What's this about?
People can see in here!
What? No.
Go.
Time to go, sweetie.
So, this is my brother.
Something's not right.
It's really annoying.
We followed you home.
Oh, I'm still working.
Just tape them up.
Oh, red is so cliche.
Send me a few pictures.
That's all they want.
That did not happen.
Have a great weekend.
What's Thunder doing?
I'll keep adding it!
Lots of pollution.
I like sheer shirts.
What's up, Leonard?
ls the ottoman okay?
Hi. What are you doing?
Ah... -Right this way.
How'd it go, weirdo?
Yeah. Are you okay?
What about the chair?
Holy shit!
What?
so it wouldn't die.
What's that up there?
You see? No hands.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
I think you like me.
Good things, I hope.
Yeah, you said that.
Welcome to New York.
They are on the move.
you know, that...
How many were there?
Can you help me out?
Yes.
Oh, my God!
Then why even call?
Unfortunately, no.
I'll think about it.
Me?
Yeah, you.
No.
He doesn't?
You okay?
Yep.
I'm looking for Mark.
If you don't mind...
Bye! See you later!
Martha Stewart...
Bye, see you later!
Yeah, right. Bitch.
Dad, this is Amber.
you hold it together.
Okay. I just, um...
Really?
Please.
Oh, this is beautiful!
Okay. That's great.
Yeah, that's okay.
What are you saying?
You okay with that?
Where have you been?
leave me out of it.
How about that clue?
Like a brain camp.
That was so much fun!
Well, Amber wins.
Lawyers cost money.
GPS does not lie.
I'm cute-cute Kate.
That was throw-up.
Carmela? Really?
This should be good.
It was just a burp.
Can't forget this.
Can I make a toast?
What happened to you?
Not hide. Lose.
No man likes that.
Bad!
