gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
blair , i just got invited
to the institute of arts and letters&apos;
summer artists retreat .
that &apos;s incredible ! but what could possibly be the problem ,
besides rome in august ?
i need your photographic memory
and your passion for social upheaval
to help me write the book about the upper east side .
my computer &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s gossip girl . she took it .
after we got the address for tonight ,
i gave it to gossip girl .
i just need you to keep our agreement .
take down lily .
you can &apos;t hold me responsible for everything bad in your life .
i can because you are .
i want you gone for good . pack your things .
serena , their is no &quot; us . &quot;
and--and now that our parents are splitting up ,
i never have to see you again .
do you have what i asked for ?
what did we bury in that coffin ?
starting today ,
i will be the only bass in bass industries .
all i &apos;ve done is work to protect your legacy .
and pine after blair waldorf .
i &apos;m gonna take over my mother &apos;s company ,
and it can be our future .
you said i always bet against you ,
but this time i &apos;m all in .
could it be any hotter ?
it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re not fair @-@ skinned .
otherwise , your summer &quot; under the tuscan sun &quot;
would end up under a scalpel , removing a melanoma .
i know it was my idea ,
but why did i bring you to italy ?
i should be at the workshop right now in rome
with all of the other writers , writing .
you shouldn &apos;t be creating in a workshop .
you &apos;re not an elf .
besides , how can you possibly be inspired inside ?
but here , on the other hand ,
if you &apos;re really looking for payback ,
then what better place
to knock the upper east side out of the dark ages
than in the cradle of the renaissance itself ?
da vinci , galileo , humphrey ...
underwood ?
oh , dio mio . have you learned nothing ?
technology means hackers .
we &apos;re going old school .
don &apos;t just stand there . start typing .
oh , grazie . i &apos;m parched .
thank you .
you &apos;ll get yours when i get mine .
real names this time . no holding back .
everyone gets exposed . the naked truth .
faster ! faster ! faster !
could this take any longer ?
i &apos;m gonna ride this thing all night long .
i hate trains .
excuse me . can you , like , move your leg ?
my god !
do ...
that ...
again .
what &apos;s the rush ?
we &apos;ve got all the time in the world .
welcome back , upper east siders .
call me superstitious ,
but i &apos;ve got a feeling this fall could be my last season .
let &apos;s face it . i &apos;ve been at this a long time .
but age breeds wisdom ,
and this i know--
the best is yet to come .
you both look so relaxed .
hamptons good for the soul , huh ?
well , yes , the hamptons were lovely ,
but nothing compares to the seychelles ,
where bart and i renewed our vows .
which was restorative .
but our time with eric off the african coast
was the highlight .
have you heard from mr. chuck ?
well , we &apos;re hoping charles used his summer to relax
as much as we have .
well , i &apos;m sure as soon as he sees what happy couple you are ,
happy family won &apos;t be far behind .
i &apos;m not so sure .
look at all this . it &apos;ll take weeks to get through .
i thought serena was keeping the apartment in order .
well , that was the deal .
and since she &apos;s been ignoring my texts ,
our primary mode of communication ,
i assumed she was taking care of it .
vanya ?
when is serena gonna be back ?
miss serena ?
i haven &apos;t seen her all summer .
i really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me .
yeah , well , it &apos;s nice to have
someone else asking the questions for a change .
plus professor peiser taught
my favorite journalism class at columbia .
well , clearly it worked . i mean , look how successful you are .
well , we &apos;re about to find out .
i think it &apos;s really brave ,
you deciding to run &quot; the spectator &quot; on your own .
no investors , no partners , no safety net .
wait , are you here to freak me out
or write a paper on--on my paper ?
sorry . i &apos;m just impressed .
i wouldn &apos;t be going it alone if i didn &apos;t think i could succeed .
and i have a story on the horizon
i know is gonna secure the company &apos;s future .
you wouldn &apos;t happen to want
to give professor peiser &apos;s class an exclusive ?
no .
but i like your initiative ,
and if we &apos;re still in business by the time you graduate .
maybe i &apos;ll interview you for a job .
lily , hey . how are you ?
serena ? no , i haven &apos;t heard from her all summer .
i assumed she was somewhere
between tulum and the turks and caicos .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t worry about it .
serena &apos;s disappeared on us before ,
but we always find her , and she &apos;s always fine .
yes .
okay .
i am well aware of the deadlines , mother .
you don &apos;t need to put any more pressure on me .
the stress is making my hair fall out in clumps .
thank god for this chapeau .
if the olsen twins can build a fashion empire
bossing around pattern drafters , then so can i.
oh , i have to go .
someone i actually want to speak to just walked up .
a bientot , maman .
bonjour , ma cherie .
ca va , jean pierre ? how was your meeting ?
good . now that it &apos;s over , i can be here with you .
you frenchmen . must be why i always come back to paris .
your mother again ?
i actually wish it was .
it &apos;s my friend nate . someone we know is missing .
what happened ?
who can say ? she does it all the time .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .
you don &apos;t sound convinced .
when was the last time you saw her ?
when i kicked her out of my apartment
and told her my life would be better off without her in it .
it appears she got the message . what are you going to do ?
exactly what needs to be done--
set some more meetings with buyers ,
look at the latest sketches ,
contact the textile mill
to see if they can move up production dates .
you don &apos;t have to take all this down .
you &apos;re not my assistant .
no .
but i do care about you ,
which is why i &apos;m booking you a ticket back to new york .
that &apos;s where you need to be right now .
for your friend .
first class ?
bulkhead by the window .
merci .
de rien .
did this really happen , you and serena ?
on the bar of the campbell apartment .
every dirty detail exactly as it occurred .
not that .
the part where you guys get it on is &quot; fifty shades of boring &quot;
no offense .
after that , when you realized that she had a sex tape .
she said she erased it ,
but did you actually see her do it ?
no . i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
i mean , she said she would . i &apos;m sure she did .
so she might still have it .
are you going to answer that ?
no . it &apos;s blair again ,
and i know you might not believe this ,
but i &apos;d rather listen to you than
blair and her excuses for dumping me .
dan , finally ! thank you for picking up .
i know you &apos;ve been dodging my calls all summer ,
but ... i talked to nate ,
and no one knows where serena is .
i thought you two might be together , hating me .
are you with her ?
hello , blair .
georgina .
i should &apos;ve known it was you
from the sound of that disdainful silence .
now i don &apos;t even want to know
why you are picking up dan &apos;s phone ,
but please put him on so i can speak to him . this is serious .
no one has seen serena for months .
not even gossip girl has posted about her .
and what could be worse than that ?
always good catching up , blair .
ciao .
wait ! no ! no !
okay , change of venue .
what ? why ? what did blair say ?
there &apos;s a new ending for your book ,
if we can find serena before anyone else does .
i don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re doing here , chuck .
neither do i.
but i &apos;m trying to find out .
this was the last project my father worked on
before he
how do i put this delicately ?
faked died .
he said he was in miami ,
but he was here in dubai with you .
as his translator .
and i already told you everything i know .
look , i pored over all the records
when i took over bass industries ,
and there was nothing about a project in dubai .
and i know a view this breathtaking
would &apos;ve taken up my father &apos;s time and interest .
once again , chuck , i wish i could help .
when your father walked away from this , i lost out , too .
i &apos;m not sure what else i can do .
maybe you can translate for me .
do you speak unstable psychopath ?
hello , georgina .
to what do i owe the displeasure ?
from all around the world ,
our favorite upper east siders are asking the same question .
but i couldn &apos;t care less .
serena van der woodsen is dead .
at least to me .
法国巴黎 - 美国纽约
spotted at j.f.k. and teterboro--
our favorite u.e.s.ers reterning home .
what motivated this sudden flurry of transatlantic travel ?
could it be a certain passport
that didn &apos;t get stamped this summer ?
no , her passport &apos;s here .
it was in a box with her other things .
so let &apos;s focus our efforts closer to home .
thank you , officer .
charles .
you didn &apos;t have to come home ...
but i am so glad you did .
of course .
and you &apos;re not alone .
amira abbar . hello .
amira &apos;s a new friend . we met in dubai .
beautiful city .
with beautiful women .
i &apos;m bart bass .
son , i trust your summer was relaxing .
indeed , father .
nothing like travel to clear the mind .
i found dubai fascinating .
such a forward @-@ looking city , yet so many links to the past .
it &apos;s true . i showed chuck all my favorite spots .
usually ,
chuck can find a woman &apos;s favorite spot all by himself .
blair , you &apos;re back , and you brought a friend .
and who &apos;s your mystery guest ?
i was just introducing her . where were we ?
just leaving .
got a couple things to clear up at the office .
yes , i &apos;m gonna head out with you .
i have one more place to check for serena .
nice to meet you .
amira , i &apos;ll meet you at the hotel .
uh , yes . you can drop her off on your way to my mother &apos;s .
i think there &apos;s jam on the steering wheel .
consider yourself lucky if it &apos;s just jam .
i don &apos;t know how much time you &apos;ve spent around babies ...
only yours , when you were pretending he was mine .
constant pooping , food throwing ,
random explosions out of every orifice--
babies are nauseating .
not that i don &apos;t love being a mother .
just not as much as going on secret missions with me .
a woman shouldn &apos;t have to choose .
so wait , who-- who were you texting
when philip dropped the van off ?
&apos;cause i think i was the last person to see serena ,
and i have no clue where she is .
yes , but you forget that i &apos;ve known s since ninth grade .
and whenever she hits a road bump in life ,
inevitably she reaches for a bump of a different kind .
and her favorite provider is ...
damien dalgaard .
you really think serena &apos;s on drugs ?
well , hopefully , or clinically insane .
either would be a great ending for your book .
what ? poughkeepsie &apos;s known for three things .
i highly doubt that s is enrolled at vassar ,
and she &apos;s certainly not signed
for a taste testing at the culinary institute .
which leaves ?
where we &apos;re headed .
the hudson river state mental hospital .
swear to me that nothing is going on between you and amira .
when i saw you two together ,
i thought you &apos;d reneged on the promise we made .
never . she &apos;s a weapon against my father .
that &apos;s all .
they were involved in some off @-@ the @-@ record business deal .
i brought her back to rattle him .
oh , she was his translator ?
well , you &apos;ve always expressed admiration
for women who are good with tongues .
she &apos;s very pretty .
no prettier than your jean pierre .
as head of your public relations ,
does he know how much you enjoy relations in public ?
you two seem close .
well , he &apos;s been my constant companion
since i returned to paris .
focusing on work has made it easier to be away from you .
if i had known it would be this difficult
going our separate ways , i would never have agreed .
well , we had to come to some kind of an agreement
or we never would &apos;ve left that hotel room in monte carlo .
and ...
we have much to do .
but like i said in the casino ,
i &apos;m all in .
my bet &apos;s on us .
lily . what are you doing here ?
i thought you and bart were circling the globe
in an 80 @-@ foot yacht .
well , the yacht was 110 feet ,
and most people who &apos;ve actually been on one call it a boat .
i assume
you didn &apos;t come all the way to brooklyn to tell me that .
no . i didn &apos;t come here to tell you anything .
i came here to ask . have you seen serena ?
she &apos;s missing , and i thought she might &apos;ve sought out dan .
well , dan &apos;s in italy ,
and i haven &apos;t seen or heard from serena .
oh , really ? is that why her sweater &apos;s here ?
rufus , you have reached an all @-@ time low .
i mean , first , you let her hide here and then you lie to me ,
right to my face .
that &apos;s not serena &apos;s sweater .
it &apos;s mine .
what is going on here ?
ivy &apos;s been staying here .
here ? with you ?
lily , could i get you a glass of water ?
you don &apos;t look well .
i assure you i am quite all right .
unlike you .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with rufus . he saved me .
after i tore up your check you wrote me , i had nothing .
i was on the verge of doing something desperate ,
and rufus opened his home to me , gave me a second chance .
i don &apos;t know why it matters to you ,
but she &apos;s sleeping in dan &apos;s room .
it doesn &apos;t matter to me .
none of it does .
my daughter is missing . god knows what happened to her .
and i don &apos;t know why she would ever think of coming here .
this is all clothes and toiletries .
we &apos;re never gonna discover serena &apos;s secrets in her loofah .
she never kept a day planner ,
maybe an address book that might have some names in it ?
serena &apos;s life is on her cell phone ,
and it seems to be the only thing she has with her .
still nothing from gossip girl ?
i checked .
her last post on serena was in the spring ,
the day she moved out .
well , yeah , just because she hasn &apos;t written about serena
doesn &apos;t mean she doesn &apos;t know anything about her .
you do have a personal correspondence with our poison pen pal .
yeah . well , when i heard from lily ,
it was the first thing i tried .
gossip girl didn &apos;t give me anything .
nate , you have to convince her .
haven &apos;t you ever seen a hitchcock movie
or watched &quot; dateline &quot; ?
there &apos;s only so many ways this goes--
kidnap / ransom , torture / murder , or brainwash / cult .
okay , blair , we get it .
no , you don &apos;t .
we both know
that serena is quite capable of hurting herself .
but ...
this time , i &apos;m afraid i hurt her , too .
there is one more thing i can try .
anything , please .
if you have a card , now &apos;s the time to play it .
it &apos;s okay .
we &apos;ll find her .
looks like n. is about to save the day .
不然我就公布录像
but we &apos;ll see if he can still save his friend .
and that way , we could take advantage
of the natural light .
what do you think ?
earth to rufus .
have you heard one thing i &apos;ve said ?
oh , yeah . sorry .
um , &quot; earth to rufus . &quot;
that &apos;s a really cool name for a solo record , by the way .
admit it .
lily &apos;s visit upset you ,
not just because something could &apos;ve happened to serena ,
but because lily would think
there was something going on between us .
all you &apos;ve done is been a good person .
what i &apos;ve done is
dragged you from one potential art gallery to another .
i mean , if you have to see one more polished concrete floor ...
it was fun .
and it was worth it , finding this place .
look , i &apos;ll call the agent ,
and i &apos;ll tell him you &apos;ll take it ,
and i &apos;ll go pick up the keys .
i can &apos;t let you do all that .
you can and you will ,
because you &apos;re gonna be too busy helping lily .
well , i guess i was serena &apos;s dad longer than anyone else .
which is why you should go .
thanks , ivy .
and , um ...
if there are any problems with that realtor ...
there won &apos;t be . i &apos;ve got this .
trust me .
hi . you &apos;ve reached lola . leave a message .
lola , hi . it &apos;s ivy .
so congrats on booking a tv series .
nbc , huh ?
it &apos;s very impressive .
well , whatever acting you have going on over there
has nothing on my performance .
rufus humphrey-- he &apos;s easy on the eyes
and even easier to manipulate .
call me .
all right , so we &apos;re not too far
from where gossip girl said she is .
what makes you so sure
we &apos;re not being led on a wild goose chase , nathaniel ?
i mean , gossip girl is only slightly less trustworthy
than , say , georgina sparks or ...
me .
you know , you could at least pretend you &apos;re relieved
that serena wasn &apos;t institutionalized .
any disappointment you &apos;re sensing is not because
the mental hospital was a dead end .
it stems from the fact that you and i missed out
on a real opportunity .
empty hospital bed ,
4 @-@ point restraints , soundproof rubber walls--
no , no , no , no , no . you stop right there
before i start chugging this premium unleaded .
i paid a serious price for serena &apos;s location .
i was gonna break a major story .
i had surveillance video
that could &apos;ve led me to the identity of gossip girl .
unmasking gossip girl ? that &apos;s a major media coup .
i @-@ i can &apos;t imagine a better way to relaunch &quot; the spectator . &quot;
yeah , well , you &apos;re gonna have to .
i traded the whole story to find out where serena is .
i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s noble and selfless .
of course you don &apos;t .
you put your whole venture at risk .
hey , if it helps serena , it &apos;s worth it .
come on , humphrey .
i can go undercover as a patient .
you could be my orderly .
something about mental hospitals really just ...
gets me going .
yeah , it &apos;s because you &apos;re insane .
i say we turn around right now to go home
and pretend none of this ever happened .
start the car now , dan .
we have to see what this odyssey can do in an open road .
and i &apos;d say 40 , 45 max .
why ? what &apos;s the sudden rush ?
that limo is chuck &apos;s . i memorized the license plate .
i knew he and blair knew where serena was .
damien was right all along .
we have to get there before they do .
serena recouping in rehab is much less interesting
than a full @-@ on slut spiral .
that &apos;s a heartwarming tale ,
but why--why would you just assume
that chuck is with blair anyway ?
no , hey !
georgina , wait a second . wait a second . you gotta hold up .
what are you doing ?
get in !
open the--stop the car .
so the place we &apos;re going to
doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s on an actual road .
so she &apos;s literally off the map .
well , whatever backwoods town we &apos;re headed to ,
it can &apos;t be good .
serena is not country strong .
yeah , well , we &apos;re gonna have to be for her .
can you turn right here , please ?
we need to go west .
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
what are we doing ?
sabotage .
georgina sparks .
with humphrey in tow .
hey , guys . nice day for a drive , huh ?
don &apos;t talk to them . let &apos;s go now .
w @-@ where are you going and what are you doing with her ?
probably the same thing you &apos;re doing with him .
saving serena ?
no . finding serena .
and since you &apos;re going to be following us ,
i &apos;m going to have you to follow my lead as well .
which means what , exactly ?
do nothing . whatever serena is doing ,
we can &apos;t get involved .
we &apos;re there to observe and record ,
like a documentary .
this isn &apos;t a reality show , sparks .
this is reality , a concept i know you &apos;re a little fuzzy on .
so whatever filth @-@ filled , paint @-@ huffing meth den
we find serena cracked out in ,
we don &apos;t judge .
we &apos;re still her friends no matter what .
we &apos;re her family .
oh , aren &apos;t you just the kindest , nicest
little trust fund babies in the whole world ?
but when it comes to what serena &apos;s capable of ,
i think you &apos;ll find it &apos;s nothing like what you imagined .
i can &apos;t argue with you there .
i would just like to point out that most serial killers
are high @-@ functioning members of society who lead a double life .
she could be trapped in the basement
or buried in the backyard .
good idea , georgina .
why don &apos;t you grab a shovel and start digging ?
there &apos;s--there &apos;s gotta be an explanation for all this .
can i help you ?
i believe you can . we &apos;re looking for our friend serena .
blonde . lags for days .
effortless charisma
that only someone far less secure
than i am would find threatening .
and i &apos;m the weird one ?
i believe you mean sabrina ?
i think someone &apos;s about to toss her cookies .
and the only thing more disturbing
than finding her on drugs or in a psychward
is seeing her happy and healthy .
who wants that ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
uh , looking for you .
to observe and record .
no . we &apos;re here to help you .
and get you home .
and , uh , i don &apos;t even know what i &apos;m doing here .
can &apos;t you see there &apos;s a party going on
and you &apos;re not invited ?
crashing parties is one of our favorite pastimes .
especially when it involves infiltrating
a sophisticated yet deadly cult .
now which one is the charismatic leader ?
please leave before it &apos;s too late .
sabrina !
sabrina .
too late .
sabrina , you didn &apos;t tell me you invited friends .
that is so sabrina .
oh , she loves surprises .
she has so many surprises , you could write a book about &apos; em .
where to end that book is the challenge .
i hope you don &apos;t mind us dropping by .
steven . nice to meet you .
and of course not .
the more , the merrier on this special day .
please , stay and be a part of it .
oh , yes , steven . i think we will .
why don &apos;t we get my friends some drinks then ?
okay .
i know i &apos;m not exactly a welcome houseguest these days ,
but we shouldn &apos;t let our recent history overshadow our past .
thanks . i appreciate it .
how could i have thought it was okay to go all summer
without actually talking to my own daughter ?
whatever this is , lil , isn &apos;t your fault .
and why should i believe that ?
because that &apos;s what you told me when jenny ran away ,
and she was much younger and crazier ,
with much heavier eye makeup than serena .
we raised good girls .
unpredictable , sure .
try reckless , defiant .
spirited ,
independent .
not unlike their parents at that age .
oh , god . who can remember back that far ?
i can , and seeing the way her mom turned out ,
i have every confidence that serena will be okay .
well , look , i &apos;m sorry about earlier .
i shouldn &apos;t have stormed out like that . i had no right .
i should &apos;ve known you wouldn &apos;t be attracted to someone
like ... you know ...
ivy .
so sorry to interrupt , but , um ,
i just came from the gallery ,
and , uh , look .
we got it .
i was just--i was so excited . i couldn &apos;t wait !
it &apos;s what we dreamed about all summer .
well played , rufus .
you butter me up , remind me how great you can be ,
only to have your little tramp show up here
and throw whatever this is in my face .
lily , hold on .
is it any wonder our children are still so immature
with such role models for parents ?
don &apos;t say anything you &apos;re gonna regret .
i have no regrets , rufus ,
only that i let you in my home today .
i &apos;m already leaving .
you know , i know you &apos;re really worried about serena ,
but you should try to relax your face .
you &apos;re getting some very pronounced frown lines .
bye .
this is so much worse than we thought .
because you &apos;re here ? i agree .
what makes you say that ? it &apos;s a nice house .
he seems like a nice guy .
look at this .
trellis , chairs , pastor . this is a wedding .
and serena was wearing a white dress !
either she &apos;s the bride , or she &apos;s just really tacky .
i told you . she &apos;s obviously had a psychotic break .
serena &apos;s taken too many happy pills ,
and now she think she &apos;s sabrina from dan &apos;s book .
that actually sounds vaguely plausible .
or today &apos;s the day of the cult sacrifice ,
and since i don &apos;t see any volcanoes in the area ,
i wonder if they &apos;re burning her at the stake .
and then you lost me .
whatever is going on , we can &apos;t let her marry this guy .
time for a plan .
okay , well , lily was really worried this morning ,
so i should at least call her
and let her know we found serena .
and i can reach out to the ostroff center ,
have them ready serena &apos;s old bed just in case .
and humphrey and i will try to get her alone .
we &apos;re the closest to her ,
the best chance of breaking through .
aren &apos;t you forgetting someone ?
trying to .
fear not . i &apos;ve seduced a man of the cloth before .
i can do it again .
this wedding cannot happen .
blair , why don &apos;t you go find serena on your own ?
you know , i &apos;m really not up for a super secret mission ,
especially with you .
i &apos;m not even here to help .
georgina just dragged me along so i could , you know ,
oh . okay .
what is wrong with you ?
uh , aside from the fact that my face now hurts ?
you know what , blair ? you chose chuck .
i don &apos;t owe you an explanation . good luck .
in here , chuck .
wrong bass , my dear .
what are you doing here ?
i came here to ask you the same question .
so is chuck using you ,
or are you using him ?
what goes on between chuck and me is none of your business .
you better hope your relationship
has nothing to do with business ,
because so help me ,
if you &apos;ve told him anything about mine .
i haven &apos;t .
yet .
but that could always change .
chuck is very persuasive .
takes after his father in more ways than one .
what do you want to leave town with your mouth shut ?
you think you can just buy my silence ?
i can buy anything .
it &apos;s one of the chief perks of being really rich .
$ 10 million .
everything okay ?
you seem a little nervous .
oh . yeah , no . it &apos;s just a lot of pressure ,
and i want everything to be perfect . so ...
but when do i get to see you alone ?
that &apos;s all i care about .
not soon enough .
although , i , uh , imagine
you wanna spend some time with your friends .
so are they from vassar
or did you , uh , grow up with them in wisconsin ?
uh , wisconsin .
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry i didn &apos;t tell you that i invited them .
it just must &apos;ve slipped my mind with all this going on .
no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay . i &apos;ll see you out there .
okay .
wisconsin ?
seriously ?
do you even know where that is on a map ?
what i do know is ,
you told me you never wanna see me again ,
and then you show up here , today of all days ,
when i &apos;m finally happy with someone i actually care about ?
cares about you
or sabrina from madison who goes to vassar ?
georgina &apos;s right . you really are delusional .
i &apos;m not gonna let you ruin this .
serena , i have no intention of ruining your big day .
i hope you do marry this guy . frankly , it would be
the kind of desperate , attention @-@ seeking stunt
that would prove you &apos;re every bit as shallow and sad
as the character in my book , so--
okay , i deserved that one .
wait .
wait , marry him ?
how &apos;d it go ?
humphrey and i split up .
i didn &apos;t find serena , so hopefully he did . you ?
the ostroff center &apos;s on alert ,
though apparently now it &apos;s called the pedowitz institute .
great news . you &apos;ll never guess what i found .
looks like nate archibald to me .
after i talked to lily ,
i found her rooting around serena &apos;s bathroom .
not rooting . snooping . and all for a good reason .
the only thing you were supposed to be doing
was getting between that man and his cloth .
he &apos;s protestant . i do my best work with catholics .
thank god i &apos;m an atheist .
great . now this wedding is gonna happen unless we find serena ,
which requires us finding dan .
well , that might be easier than you think .
could i have everyone &apos;s attention , please ?
sabrina , would you-- would you join me ?
tell them , please .
of course .
okay , so serena explained everything
explained what ?
that &apos;s she &apos;s never been happy in her whole life
and she found true love for the very first time ?
please .
... in life , which is why i &apos;m--i &apos;m so glad
that you all could be here for this special moment .
and to have the love of my life by my side .
so let &apos;s , uh , let &apos;s all raise a glass--
no ! no !
we will raise nothing !
you cannot marry her .
you don &apos;t even know her !
blair , please .
her name isn &apos;t sabrina either .
it is serena . serena van der woodsen !
and that &apos;s not all .
what are you doing ? i &apos;ve got this .
public humiliation &apos;s really more my forte .
sabrina serena has a history of mental imbalance ,
drug use , and promiscuity .
that &apos;s right . she &apos;s got a rap sheet and a snuff film .
yeah , and we have contacted a psychiatric care center
who has agreed to take her into custody .
kill me now .
hey ! what are you doing down there ? !
wait . who are the two angry guys in matching hats ?
they &apos;re the grooms . that &apos;s what i was trying to say .
this is not serena &apos;s wedding .
will someone tell me what &apos;s going on here ?
why are the maid of honor &apos;s friends
ruining david and david &apos;s wedding ?
i know i have some explaining to do .
but can we talk , just the two of us , please ?
no . no one goes anywhere .
no more lies . i have proof that you &apos;re on drugs .
i found these in your bathroom .
yeah , those are vitamins .
okay . like we &apos;re supposed to believe that .
steven makes them . he has a holistic health company .
wait . you &apos;re steven spence .
i saw you speak at the t.e.d. conference last year .
( 指technology , entertainment , design , 即技术 娱乐 设计 )
i told you i was fine .
actually , no , you didn &apos;t .
yeah . dan is right .
you fell off the face of the earth without a word .
but isn &apos;t that what you wanted ? you kicked me out of your house .
you said you have no reason to ever speak to me again .
and , what , you two were too busy doing whatever it is you do
to even send a text ?
i spent the summer in the middle east ,
dealing with something relating to my father . it &apos;s serious .
well , and so am i about turning my life around .
wait a second . blair , you two spent the summer apart ?
i started my summer on a train ,
being revived by paramedics .
mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth on public transportation ?
yeah , i &apos;d say that &apos;s rock bottom .
yeah , i would , too ,
which is why i wanted
to start fresh without any of you .
as for why i pretended to be someone else ,
well , i @-@ i think that explains itself .
serena !
i don &apos;t believe you .
well , i &apos;m not gonna let her just charge off without
no , not serena . you . that you chose chuck ,
that i don &apos;t like , but i
dan , please don &apos;t do this .
but then i find out that you &apos;re not even with him .
i am with him ,
or at least i will be .
we made a pact .
we have things we need to do on our own .
but when we are both in that next place ,
we will be together for good . end of story .
so i didn &apos;t lose you to chuck .
i lost you to the idea of chuck ,
at some point in the hopefully not @-@ to @-@ distant future , maybe ?
well , when you put it that way ...
you know , you had someone who loved you unconditionally ,
treated you right , and wanted to be with you every day ,
and then you threw that all away
to let chuck bass decide when he &apos;s ready for you ?
you think you two have an epic love ,
but all you have are excuses .
i have to go find serena .
i &apos;m sorry i came to lily &apos;s .
i never meant to cause any problems .
lily thinks what she wants .
it &apos;s always the worst , especially about me .
well , she &apos;s wrong .
i probably shouldn &apos;t be saying this ,
but ...
i &apos;m glad you got away from her .
she doesn &apos;t appreciate you .
never did .
you know , if you have such a poor opinion of lily ,
then ...
why was it so important for you to get close to her ?
i realize now
she &apos;s not the one i wanna be close to .
you &apos;re the good one , and you care about other people .
and i think that &apos;s why she &apos;s so threatened by me .
i see the real you ,
and i don &apos;t think she deserves you .
that &apos;s an interesting theory .
i think it &apos;s more than that .
ivy ...
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m not a kid .
you &apos;re not married .
why are you still here ?
you didn &apos;t think i was leaving without you ?
or ... without saying i &apos;m sorry .
because i am , serena .
thinking that i really lost you
made me regret every horrible thing i &apos;ve ever said to you .
well , that &apos;s a lot of regret .
however complicated our friendship got ,
i shouldn &apos;t have let it go .
i shouldn &apos;t have let you go .
&quot; b.f.f. &quot; means &quot; best friend forever , &quot; right ?
well , maybe it &apos;s time to admit that ...
we &apos;re stuck with each other .
i appreciate the kind words ,
and--and i know that they &apos;re hard coming from you ,
but i don &apos;t want to be stuck with you .
i want a fresh start
with steven .
fine .
if that &apos;s how you want it , stay here .
you can have poughkeepsie .
hell , you can even have schenectady ,
but i get manhattan .
have a nice life .
poor b.
looks like she just got dumped by the love of her life ,
and we &apos;re not talking chuck or dan .
the two of us alone in your limo ?
you &apos;re really tempting fate . you know that ?
unless that &apos;s your intention , of course .
we &apos;re both back in new york , doing what we need to do .
maybe our pact is just an excuse
for us not to be together .
blair , i love you with all my heart ,
and that is the reason
we cannot take the chance of messing this up .
sure . because what would your father think if you failed ?
that i distracted you .
that ... you sacrificed your empire for me .
blair , you are a distraction ,
because when we &apos;re together you &apos;re all i think about .
and i would give up my empire for you .
i would give up everything for you .
after a couple nights in monte carlo ,
i lost track of all time .
we were exhausted and starving .
i think i had an actual fever .
but that &apos;s not why we need to do this ,
and neither to prove a point to my father .
then what ?
in the past , i blamed my mistakes on you ,
and bart was right on that count .
it &apos;s the boy who blames the girl , not the man ,
and that &apos;s what i want to be with you .
it won &apos;t be much longer , i promise .
arthur , pull over .
wait . what are you doing ? this is your limo .
i need to walk it off .
hey , sage .
hi . sorry for dropping in after hours ,
but i was walking by and i saw that your office light was on .
ah . no , you , uh , you just--you thought of more questions , huh ?
only one .
would you like to have a drink with me ?
yeah . i could use a drink , actually .
bad news on your big story ?
real bad .
what &apos;s old is new again .
i may not have much time left , but some things are forever .
since you know who i am ,
i thought it was time that you see where i &apos;m from .
that explains why you didn &apos;t want to
come back to the city instead of my place .
i &apos;m just on the other side of the park .
you know , all that time away ,
i didn &apos;t realize how much i missed it .
but now that i &apos;m back and i &apos;m with you ,
new york has never seemed more perfect .
the promise of love ...
no one can ruin this , no matter how hard they &apos;re gonna try .
the threat of war ...
and the fall of the mighty .
amira .
it &apos;s late . i thought you would be in your own suite .
your father gave it to me to keep quiet .
about what ?
for that amount of money , you must know a hell of a secret .
i swear i don &apos;t know what it is ,
but i wanted to stick around to find out .
that was a waste of time .
all that driving and wedding crashing and public humiliation ,
and still no serena .
what &apos;s worse , still no ending to your book .
serena still has her cell phone .
i just know that video has to be on it .
i guess we &apos;ll never know &apos; cause serena &apos;s not coming back ,
and you &apos;re not going looking for her again .
something to hide , humphrey ?
if memory serves , that video should make you a star .
or is it that you just don &apos;t want blair to see ?
can you--can you just drop it , please ?
why are you even walking me to my door ?
i &apos;m not kissing you good night .
okay . i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
and just because i &apos;ve seen it all
doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;ve seen everything .
and i gotta say , no one saw this one coming .
you may think my best days are behind me ,
but this old girl still has some new tricks .
stay tuned .
