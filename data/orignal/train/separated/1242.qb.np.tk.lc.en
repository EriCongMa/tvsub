why are you following me ?
should i take these off ?
spencer , hi . i &apos;m yvonne .
hi .
toby &apos;s told me so much about you .
i erased the security footage from the hotel
the night charlotte was murdered .
the security company we use backs up all of our tapes .
if the police get a hold of that drive
they &apos;ll see that aria left the hotel and they &apos;ll know
that you &apos;re the one who erased the footage .
you &apos;re protecting a friend .
one of the many things i love about you .
wow , that was fast .
if you &apos;re really not okay with this--
no , that was just a knee @-@ jerk reaction . it &apos;s fine .
are you sick ?
no , i &apos;m donating my eggs .
do we really think that &apos;s a murder weapon ?
i think my dad might have had something
to do with charlotte &apos;s murder .
he swore that if charlotte ever got out
he would do whatever it takes to protect me .
did i scare you ?
why are you sitting in the dark ?
i , uh , i have something to tell you .
i guess you have been able to put things together .
enough to know that i have been hiding something from you .
i have to confess that i &apos;ve ..
i &apos;ve been seeing someone .
wh .. wait , what ?
mom , hey , how long have you known about this ?
umm , well ... since he asked me .
congratulations .
i &apos;m so glad we finally told you .
now we don &apos;t have to sneak around anymore .
that &apos;s why i saw you at the radley .
oh ! you saw me ?
i @-@ i did . yeah .
i guess i just thought it was for some other reason .
with you being back in town
we needed to find some place to talk .
about when to tell you and mike .
should we call him again ?
no , let &apos;s just give him a chance to call us back first .
seems like he &apos;s never in his dorm room anymore .
you are okay with this , right ?
yeah .
you &apos;re making a lot of noise
and none of it sounds like an omelet .
the car will be here in five . we overslept .
well , maybe we should have went to bed earlier .
what fun is a sleepover if we actually sleep ?
we can stop somewhere on the way for coffee .
时间很紧张 ...
umm , i might need to go up a little later .
i have to make some calls .
isn &apos;t claudia &apos;s charity trunk show tonight ?
i thought you said you &apos;re going back for that .
that &apos;s why i brought a car back down here
so we could spend more time together
and then drive back into the city .
i know i sound like a whinging sook , but ..
i miss you .
i just have to be near a landline .
you know the cell service on the turnpike .
i have a ton of stuff to confirm .
her hair , her makeup , her nail tech
her masseuse , her trainer , her astrologer , i mean ..
what am i forgetting ? oh , her therapist .
is it really worth all this grunt work ?
johnny wujek wasn &apos;t always styling katy perry .
everybody starts in the trenches .
and my trench is claudia .
i &apos;ll work one year with her
five years as creative director
and then hello , katy .
but i &apos;m gonna do that in three .
i &apos;m sorry . i keep changing things last minute .
i &apos;ll just see you tonight .
your tie .
i don &apos;t even care .
sorry . i &apos;m a little bit early .
it &apos;s just my mom is driving me nuts .
uh , girl stuff . your car &apos;s probably here .
i &apos;ll leave you to your secrets then .
bye .
be careful . i could get used to this .
honestly , ahem , i just wanted to , uh
make sure you were fully awake .
for what ?
i think that we need to go to the cops with these new texts .
i &apos;m awake .
i mean if we really are back at square one with a--
we don &apos;t know for sure that this is an a.
i don &apos;t know . that trash can full of black hoodies ?
it felt like somebody was saying all the rules are changed .
and all we know for sure is this a isn &apos;t charlotte .
they could be anybody , anywhere
hiding in plain sight .
as in sara harvey ?
i mean , do you really think that it &apos;s her
hiding behind all those evil emojis ?
i don &apos;t know . she can &apos;t really type that well .
maybe a picture &apos;s easier for her to send .
i &apos;m starving . do we have anything ?
yeah , i got a little something .
you want a refill ?
yes , please .
hey , what about ezra ?
couldn &apos;t he clear this up ?
has anybody heard from him ?
well , my guess is that he left town
to avoid telling us what he knows .
i mean , i &apos;m not even saying we need to build an airtight case .
we could just go to toby .
no .
caleb , he &apos;s finally happy .
he &apos;s moved on . i really don &apos;t wanna throw this in his path .
at least not until we have something more
than a few snarky emojis from an unlisted number
and a photo of an alleged murder weapon .
i guess you &apos;re right .
i mean , we &apos;re talking about aria &apos;s dad .
you know it &apos;s like if he did this , he did it to protect her .
if we were to get this golf club
sara couldn &apos;t hold it over our heads .
and then we really could go to the cops about her .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s a calendar alert .
have lunch with gil .
i really don &apos;t remember scheduling that .
oh , my god . this election is totally eating up my brain .
oh , my god , i have endless e @-@ mails
and then i &apos;ve that strategy session this afternoon
and i have to make those campaign calls .
yeah , i &apos;ve been pretty distracted
the last few days too .
i might be slightly distracted .
is this distracting you ?
mmm , no .
you know , i can probably just get a few e @-@ mails done
if you wanna continue .
yeah .
how about this ?
that &apos;s slightly more distracting .
so what &apos;d you tell pam ?
uh , you know you can never call my mom that to her face , right ?
i told her we were still narrowing down bridesmaids &apos; dresses ,
even though you haven &apos;t asked us yet .
i mean , you &apos;re gonna ask us , right ?
you &apos;ve a lot more to worry about than that .
you need me to drive you ?
no , it &apos;s okay . the clinic has a service .
they just wanna make sure there &apos;s someone to help me
get me settled in the bed after .
i mean , i should be fine in a day or so .
well , i &apos;ll mash up your jell @-@ o just the way you like it .
em , you seem nervous .
hey , these are your eggs . you can change you mind .
that &apos;s not it . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m weirded out by that text .
from aria ?
okay , this may sound crazy cynical
but if byron and ella do get remarried
doesn &apos;t that mean she wouldn &apos;t have to testify against him ?
i mean , i &apos;m not saying that byron &apos;s guilty .
did i miss the memo that says we call people &apos;s parents
by their first names now ?
it &apos;s just like &quot; downton abbey &quot; where bates goes on trial--
hanna , i &apos;m talking about the text from ali .
didn &apos;t you ..
no .
oh , she &apos;s back .
and of course , she reaches out to me alone
and just assumes i &apos;ll come and hear her out .
i &apos;m not doing it . i mean i can &apos;t .
keeping this secret from my mom has been hard enough .
and yesterday i took this gigantor shot
and i feel like i &apos;ve had three too many macchiatos .
i mean , why does she do this , why does she always come
to me first and just expect that--
okay , are you gonna breathe
or just keep talking until you pass out ?
sorry , it &apos;s the hormones .
just tell her you &apos;re busy .
oh , i don &apos;t know why i didn &apos;t think of that .
hormones .
okay , well , can you keep them in check for ten minutes ?
this is work .
morning , claudia .
i &apos;m out of gum .
charity is so stressful .
you know i like to chew when i &apos;m stressed .
yeah , i put a whole case in your desk .
uh , peppermint , not wintergreen .
wet nails . i &apos;ll smudge .
ask your manicurist to look in the bottom left drawer .
do you need anything else ?
yes .
umm , call wilhelmina &apos; cause i wanna switch out
all the models for tonight .
tell them i want asians .
only asians . very into asians .
they &apos;re incredibly chic .
this is ezra . leave me a message .
voice mailbox full .
did i interrupt ?
oh , it &apos;s , it &apos;s nothing .
what &apos;s up ?
we sprang some pretty big news on you last night
and i got the sense that maybe you &apos;re not as happy as we are .
i @-@ i just did not see it coming ... at all .
i know your surprised face .
it &apos;s very different than your concerned face .
if you have concerns , i wish you &apos;d share them .
i guess it was just all the ... sneaking around .
i @-@ i just had it in my head that something else was going on .
like what ?
well , i &apos;ve been thinking all sorts of things
since charlotte was killed .
i guess we haven &apos;t really talked about that a lot .
did your father and i give you too much space ?
maybe . i didn &apos;t even see you guys at the hearing .
to be honest , neither one of us would have stood
in support of her release .
we didn &apos;t want our opinion to influence your statement .
you needed to tell the truth .
what about later that night ?
we assumed you wanted to process things with your friends .
so ..
what ?
we took advantage of the fact that you were with your friends
and your father was at my apartment .
wait , you two were ..
you were together the whole night ?
i &apos;m ... not the kind of mom
who wants to share those details .
i checked in with you the next day .
what are you asking me ?
forget it . i ..
i @-@ i &apos;m just realizing that this is a good thing .
it &apos;s a really , really good thing .
oh , hi .
i didn &apos;t know you were coming by .
if i ask you a question
are you gonna promise not to lie to me ?
hanna , i &apos;m running late .
why &apos;d you do it , mom ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
yes , you do .
the exact drive with the exact footage of the hotel
the night charlotte was murdered , it &apos;s now missing ?
i don &apos;t buy it .
from what i understand
the police are still looking for that .
are you really gonna make me accuse you ?
i &apos;d prefer you didn &apos;t
especially when i had nothing to do with it .
so the fact that it went missing the day i told you what i did
that &apos;s just a coincidence ?
i suppose it is .
hanna , the police haven &apos;t come knocking with a warrant .
the only person who suspects that backup drive
is in this house is you .
mom , just tell me where it is . i &apos;ll get rid of it .
hanna , the drive is gone .
gone ? did you--
just be grateful your mistake has been erased .
don &apos;t think about this , think about ..
... wedding cakes and flowers and ..
fine .
i won &apos;t bring it up again .
who knew your mother had that whole stash of sample products ?
it &apos;s like she &apos;s hoarding moisturizer .
yet another thing she &apos;s good at hiding .
okay , did i just let sara harvey trick me
into trashing every room in my mother &apos;s house ?
what if your mom &apos;s telling the truth ?
what if she actually destroyed the drive ?
sara wouldn &apos;t have asked for it
unless she really thought it was here .
and if i don &apos;t hand it over , she &apos;s gonna crash my wedding .
wait .
we really think this is sara harvey sending these texts ?
who else would it be ?
well , if she leaves the hotel to pick up the drive
i can get in there and i can grab that golf club ..
... before she tries to take a swing at one of us .
we don &apos;t have the drive .
but she thinks we have the drive .
so we give it to her .
dr. rollins ?
elliott , please .
i apologize for the intrusion , but i was hoping we could , uh ..
she sent you , didn &apos;t she ? alison ?
you didn &apos;t answer her messages .
it &apos;s kind of intentional .
please .
she doesn &apos;t know i &apos;ve come to you . i &apos;m just trying to help .
i can &apos;t see her right now .
she wants to apologize . her behavior was alienating .
she shouldn &apos;t be alone right now . just come by .
for what ? a pizza and a movie ?
no , thank you .
i thought it wouldn &apos;t hurt to try .
this was a bad time to ask a favor of you .
if you need anything--
i need you to leave now .
please .
umm , are you sure , gil ?
it wasn &apos;t rescheduled for another day ?
oh , really , you don &apos;t have it in your calendar at all .
okay , umm ..
that @-@ that &apos;s fine . umm , i &apos;ll--
spencer .
okay , i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll call you right back .
hey , yvonne .
i &apos;m so sorry .
uh , whoever updated my calendar didn &apos;t , uh ,
include your contact info , so i wasn &apos;t--
couldn &apos;t call me to tell me that you &apos;re late for our lunch ?
exactly . though i guess i could have called the restaurant .
yeah , umm , so , so somebody else updates your calendar for you ?
uh , yeah . there &apos;s a campaign aide in charge of coordinating .
that &apos;s probably who you talked to , to schedule .
yeah . umm , yes , i did . yeah .
you know i have to admit i didn &apos;t expect you to reach out .
uh , the town hall was such a success
but i guess i just assumed we &apos;d retreat to our own corners .
umm , well , you know , i really wanted to pick
your brain if that &apos;s okay .
uh , this whole daughter @-@ of @-@ the @-@ candidate thing
it &apos;s so new to me and so--
of course .
you know ..
umm , inside or out ?
uh , inside &apos;s great .
do you mind if i just make one quick call ?
and then i &apos;ll be right in .
of course , i &apos;ll get a table .
okay , thanks .
uh , caleb , yvonne just showed up to my lunch with gil .
uh , did he arrange it ? some sort of campaign thing ?
no , he &apos;s not here and she thinks that i invited her .
ten bucks says evil emoji is trying to stir the pot .
and she probably hacked both of your phones .
can you get out of there ?
no .
you know what , i think i &apos;m gonna stay .
maybe she can help me figure out who scheduled this .
i shall see you soon . bye .
i wouldn &apos;t have made the effort
if i &apos;d known how much it would upset emily .
i tried to reach the others , but ..
good morning , haley . that was a great essay .
thank you .
let it go .
i mean , i &apos;ve done enough to force them away .
i don &apos;t wanna force them to take my apology too .
you may have made it difficult for your friends to support you
but that doesn &apos;t change the fact that you still need them .
how long has it been since your father made an effort ?
or jason ?
you &apos;re right .
my friends are the closest thing i have to family now .
you &apos;ve been my rock .
i have more vacation days .
i can take them if you need me to .
i appreciate that , but ..
... i &apos;m home .
time to get back to work .
back to normal .
or at least try .
i have work to catch up on and they want me to start
taking over my classes tomorrow , so ..
then i &apos;ll see you later ?
yeah .
thank you for trying .
and we both know politics is not an honest game .
you have to get used to the idea that there is no
expectation of privacy .
you &apos;re always being watched .
so how did you learn to trust the people
who work for your campaign ?
my mom ran for the school board when i was eight .
i &apos;ve grown up with the idea that you can &apos;t trust
everyone with everything .
i &apos;m guessing trust is hard for you
given what you and your friends went through .
yeah , i mean , y @-@ yeah , people know what we went through .
that &apos;s inevitable .
i wasn &apos;t out in the world for very long
before i realized that my entire sense of people was ..
... warped and i had to pound myself into a normal shape .
cut clear a ...
had to cut off bad habits with a blowtorch .
and i had to weld on new ones wherever they would fit .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with being an iron lady , spencer .
in fact , they &apos;re my favorite kind .
thank you .
umm , you know what--
uh @-@ uh , i insist . really .
uh , next one is on me then .
i will hold you to it .
i gotta run .
okay .
thank you again . bye .
thank you .
sara .
can i help you ?
i didn &apos;t realize you worked here .
i &apos;m looking for room 19 .
in the east wing .
across the courtyard on the left .
i knew you worked here .
i don &apos;t know why i lied .
my physical therapist connected me to a teacher .
i &apos;m supposed to give a talk on ... living with a disability .
but ..
but what ?
why are you here ?
after the accident ...
... when my hands were still numb and bandaged
i spent months having to be fed .
i hated ... every spoonful
from ... every nurse &apos;s aide .
i &apos;m not sure why i need to know this .
because i mistreated every person who tried to help me .
but they kept on helping .
and now i have to do that for someone else .
i guess i , i just wanna say i &apos;m sorry , alison ...
... for your loss ..
... and for lying to the judge about charlotte .
you burned her at the stake on that witness stand
and you walked .
i was scared .
and i said whatever it took to protect myself .
i shouldn &apos;t have ...
but i did .
i feel terrible about it
and everything that &apos;s happened to her since .
we both know what it meant to be close with charlotte .
i felt like we were sisters .
she used you to replace me .
when no one else was there for her , i was .
that wasn &apos;t my choice .
i didn &apos;t reject her .
i didn &apos;t lock her up .
and i spent the past five years making up for lost time
getting to know her .
we never really knew all of her .
but i was hoping ...
maybe you and i can put our pieces together
and ... understand things a little better ?
i want something good to come from all of this .
we &apos;re all she had .
i promise this will pass for the real drive .
i &apos;m glad you came to me .
you know you can always come to me .
yeah , i know .
spencer , sorry , uh , i @-@ i was just leaving .
no , there &apos;s no need to rush off . i &apos;m ...
actually , i &apos;m really glad that both of you guys
are here right now .
what &apos;s up ?
i did something not entirely out of character .
but just out of practice .
what &apos;s going on , spencer ?
toby &apos;s fiancee kind of left this .
and i kinda sort of didn &apos;t give it back right away .
y @-@ you know this is a good thing .
are you sure ?
yes , i &apos;m sure .
i can use it to try to find out who &apos;s sending these texts .
or at least get a little bit closer .
i was hoping you &apos;d say that .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s more needy today .
sara harvey and this freaking hard drive
or my boss and her gum .
i have to take this .
i &apos;ll look at both phones .
maybe with two hacks , i can follow the trails
back to a common source .
how long do you think it will take ?
uh , i &apos;ll clone yvonne &apos;s cell phone .
i mean , she &apos;ll have it back before she knows it &apos;s gone .
no , claudia , i can &apos;t leave .
yes , i &apos;ll handle it over the phone .
yeah , i promise . i can get you another four feet of catwalk .
you guys , i &apos;ve gotta go .
later .
bye , hanna .
ali .
i know you don &apos;t wanna see me .
i was just gonna leave .
well , is something wrong ?
come in .
i ...
something happened . it &apos;s really strange .
sara harvey , she came to see me .
i think sara and charlotte might have been closer
than we thought .
i think sara actually cared about her .
why would you believe a word she says ?
can i just stay here for a bit ?
i could really use someone to talk to .
i can &apos;t stay . i actually have somewhere to be .
great !
elliott told you ?
yeah , well , they &apos;re my eggs and i made the decision ,
so i need to do it .
you can say whatever you wanna say .
i don &apos;t care . just ...
promise me you won &apos;t tell my mom .
emily , elliott didn &apos;t .
honestly , i had no idea .
you &apos;re donating your eggs ?
oh , my god !
i &apos;m such a jerk .
when is this happening ?
umm , today .
and you &apos;re going by yourself ?
no , han , i @-@ i booked online .
i didn &apos;t wanna run into your mom and have her ask questions .
umm , hang on a second .
hanna , i think she &apos;s inside . i gotta go .
excuse me .
hi , can i get you a table ?
uh , no . i found this outside .
uh , i was wondering if you had a lost @-@ and @-@ found ?
thank goodness . i &apos;ve been looking for that everywhere .
i &apos;ll just tell yvonne the restaurant found this .
i &apos;ll keep you out of it .
why ?
i wouldn &apos;t want people to think you stole somebody &apos;s phone .
somebody whose mother is running against your mother .
that would be awkward .
did you set this all up ?
set all what up ?
me and yvonne , this lunch .
maybe even her leaving her phone .
were we supposed to start fighting over toby , hmm ?
candidates &apos; daughters in boyfriend brawl .
that isn &apos;t exactly explosive , political cannon fodder .
and this isn &apos;t exactly the race for a senior class president .
we don &apos;t do those kinds of things anymore .
do we , spencer ?
棕色垃圾箱
hey , claudia .
yeah , i know .
i know . i understand .
i &apos;ll be there .
6 : 30 at the latest . i &apos;m leaving now .
all done ?
you might start to get sleepy from the sedative .
thanks .
ali , you don &apos;t have to wait here with me .
there is no way i &apos;m gonna leave you here alone .
i &apos;ll be right here when you wake up .
can i ask you something ?
what are you gonna do after this ?
i &apos;m gonna use the money to finish school .
ezra needed some place quiet to work ,
so i booked a room .
i @-@ i just assumed i could expense it .
are you sure that i can &apos;t ?
ms. harvey--
i asked for privacy ...
umm , just take it out of my paycheck , i guess .
just leave them outside the door .
the rooms need to be cleaned , once a week in minimum .
that &apos;s a policy--
didn &apos;t i clear your policy ?
yeah , i &apos;ll , i &apos;ll run it by accounting next time .
thank you .
i sincerely apologize for the inconvenience .
how about brunch for two , our expense ?
i don &apos;t eat brunch .
alright . if you &apos;ll excuse me .
what are you doing ?
lie still , emily .
what is that ?
this isn &apos;t going to hurt a bit .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;ll all be over soon .
take it out . take it out .
what did you do to me ?
get off me !
no , no !
no ! no !
no .
take it out !
take it out !
what did you do to me ?
emily . emily , stop , breathe .
where were you ?
i was right outside .
did you pass anyone ?
d @-@ did you see a nurse with a m @-@ mask on her face ?
what ? no .
no , she was in here hiding in the dark .
i , i &apos;m ... groggy , but i know i saw her .
who ?
sara harvey .
emily , calm down .
it was just the drugs in your system .
no , sh @-@ she was in here .
i was in here the minute they brought you out of surgery .
i just went to go find the nurse because ... you were agitated .
i saw , i saw her .
i know i saw her .
em , relax .
you still have anesthesia in your system .
it wasn &apos;t real , okay ?
now get some rest , so i can take you home .
please tell me you don &apos;t own a selfie stick .
company christmas party .
don &apos;t judge me . these things come in handy .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve got .
well , looks like nobody &apos;s in there .
aria , i haven &apos;t broken into a place since my dorm room .
and those keys cost like a $ 100 to replace .
and i don &apos;t really know what you think i &apos;m capable of .
hotel door locks are electronic .
yeah , but i &apos;m thinking we get in there another way .
you pick the lock on the balcony .
what ?
oh , my god ! you &apos;re not serious .
you , you &apos;re tall . you &apos;ve got long legs .
okay , would you like me to toss you over first like a frisbee ?
what else are we supposed to do ?
come on ! team sparia .
old time &apos;s sake ?
i &apos;ve got to get in there and i &apos;ve got to get that golf club
before sara tries to frame my dad.&apos;
alright .
okay , watch out .
okay .
yeah , on second thought , can you come back over here
and toss me like a frisbee ?
come on .
you can do it , little big one .
okay , just give me a second .
i should have thought ahead and worn flats .
that &apos;s it .
alright .
she was trying to take out her iv .
some patients have a rough time coming out of anesthesia .
honestly , i feel a lot better .
good , because i need to have a conversation
about something that happened during the procedure .
can ... we have a moment ?
umm , you know , she can stay .
alright .
well , there &apos;s been an unforeseen development .
this has to do with the couple
who had planned on using your eggs .
they decided to back out .
it &apos;s good news . they &apos;re pregnant .
they found out earlier today .
but it means they won &apos;t need your eggs
which we &apos;ve already retrieved .
you have a decision to make .
can she keep them ?
they can be frozen for later use
but there are costs associated with that choice .
they can also be destroyed .
no .
if it &apos;s possible , can i donate them somewhere ?
i mean , i , i still feel like i wanna help someone
start a family if i can .
well , we work with a few egg banks across the state
that accept donations .
i &apos;ll get the paperwork started .
crimson .
scarlet .
oh , vermillion !
how am i the only designer in manhattan
with an assistant that can &apos;t grasp the concept of red ?
okay , i &apos;m late , but i &apos;m here . let me help you sort things out .
oh , pardon . do you have appointment ?
i work here !
hey , who the hell are you ?
this my new assistant .
i don &apos;t know her name yet .
i am greta .
6 : 30 , hanna . you promised .
i know , but i , i couldn &apos;t get a cab at penn station .
you , give me a hand .
umm , your tacky , little panda bear mug
it &apos;s in that box with the rest of your things .
you can just take that and go .
hand . hand .
give me ..
give me your hand !
steam this for me , will you , honey ?
hey , you can &apos;t talk to people like that , claudia .
hanna , dear .
you &apos;re really stressing me out .
why don &apos;t we end things on a high note , okay ?
um , on your way out , you can get me some gum .
get your own damn gum , claudia .
there &apos;s a pack in your desk .
excuse me ?
two in your briefcase , two in your purse
and a whole stash in your bedside table .
i do everything you ask me to do and then some .
and all you do , you just pick me apart
and you send me on a thousand different , ridiculous errands !
weren &apos;t you the girl that came marching in here
with a five @-@ year plan ?
well , if you leave now
you &apos;re gonna be starting over again at the bottom .
apologize
and maybe i &apos;ll consider keeping you on ..
... as second assistant .
is that the best you &apos;ve got ?
if you &apos;re trying to scare me into staying ..
... you &apos;re gonna have to do way better .
there &apos;s a line of girls just waiting to take your place .
fine , let them .
i &apos;ve been pushed around by a lot worse than you .
if she &apos;s refusing maid service , shouldn &apos;t this ..
... place have been a little bit messier ?
it doesn &apos;t even look like she &apos;s slept here .
yeah , that or she &apos;s learned how to make
hospital corners with her teeth .
spence .
you know what , umm , this was a really bad idea .
i think that we should just go back out the way that we came .
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s go .
there &apos;s no one here .
okay , that &apos;s creepy .
well , put it back or she &apos;s gonna know we were here .
she &apos;ll just blame it on housekeeping .
do you wanna get someone fired ?
come on , let &apos;s find that golf club .
do you feel anything ?
no .
where else could she be hiding a golf club ?
i &apos;m gonna go look in the closet .
okay , i &apos;ll finish up in here .
wow ! i could live in here .
this thing is seriously bigger than my apartment .
you stood up for yourself .
she &apos;s gonna blackball me .
i should have apologized .
i should have begged for my job back .
i left my panda bear mug .
that magazine has relationships with dozens of designers .
i bet if i make a few calls
you &apos;ll have ten interviews by monday .
well , you should call &quot; the times &quot; first .
our wedding announcement cannot say
jordan hobart , junior vp of ad sales
marries hanna marin , unemployed .
alright . that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;m not gonna let you spin out .
cuddle up . come on .
i really don &apos;t care what the announcement
in &quot; the times &quot; says . okay ?
and what if it said
hanna marin , luckiest girl alive
marries her genuine prince charming ?
what do you wanna do ?
you wanna go right to our place ?
or maybe stop somewhere for a drink ?
no .
do you wanna ..
... get out of the city for a few days ?
go back to rosewood ? you can clear your head ?
i don &apos;t wanna go to rosewood
... or the apartment .
can we just keep driving ?
whatever you want , love .
aria .
aria , you have to come look at this .
sara &apos;s staying here because this was charlotte &apos;s old room
when she was a patient at radley .
aria !
aria ?
aria ?
hanna ?
hanna , did you forget your key ?
hang on a sec .
i don &apos;t know who you are or what kind of game
you think you &apos;re playing , but guess what ?
if you can change the rules , so can we .
goodbye .
