A good friend of mine, Sheriff Peter Coleman,
down in Briscoe County, Texas,
reached out to me about a possible case.
The same unsub killed one john and two prostitutes.
If you can't make sure my bitches are safe,
then what good are you?
Because before he was Justin Mills,
he was Gordon Borell,
And he was arrested for cutting one of the ladies he employed.
But you said the unsub wanted us to catch him and punish him.
What he really wanted was for us to catch the preacher.
We need to tell him we know he didn't do this.
Oh, preacher, what have you gotten yourself into?
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Blake!
Reid!
We need a medic now!
There's too much blood!
Hey, you're doing great, all right?
Yeah. You gotta stay right here, ok?
Eyes on me. Eyes on me.
No, no. No.
Ethan? Ethan!
Open your eyes.
Hurry!
Hurry!
Suspect is down. Repeat, suspect is down.
We got this covered.
One of yours is in bad shape.
Let's go.
Copy that. Two of ours, 3 of theirs.
Any casualties?
One. Coleman.
Coleman?
And what about Reid?
Not good. They're taking him to the hospital.
I'll call you back.
All right, Derek, you should go get that looked at.
We'll meet you there.
Fastest route to the hospital is highway 17.
Thanks.
The sound is like a teakettle.
Do you hear it?
What?
Reid.
Pressure's dropping.
Pulse is thready. Starting large-bore I.V.
Reid!
Agent, you've got to sit back.
You gotta help him, man.
Kid, come on, now.
Stay with me. I'm right here.
Reid.
Reid!
Stay with me.
Demons
"When truth is buried, it grows.
It chokes. It gathers such an explosive force
that on the day it bursts out,

Emile Zola.
Anything yet?
No.
Spence would have read like two books by now.
Maybe 3.
It should have been me.
Or me or any of us.
No.
He pushed me out of the way.
If he doesn't make it.
He'll make it.
He has to.
He's just--he's too young.
Yeah, there's still things for him to do.
You know, he wants kids.
Can you imagine Spence as a dad?
That'd be the luckiest kid in the world.
No doubt.
You made it.
Yeah, it turns out we're not the only one that's connected
and he knows somebody with a plane.
How is he?
Still in surgery.
You all can see Agent Morgan now.
Well, if you don't mind, I'd really like to stay here.
The second you hear anything, call me.
I'll be right back.
How's Reid?
He's still in surgery.
No! What are you doing?
You can bet your ass I'm not gonna just sit around here.
Guys, come on, get me out of here.
Actually, you are. Just hang on a second.
Just until we figure out what's what.
Catch me up.
The 3 victims inside were dead before the shooting started.
Lividity had set in and there was no blood spatter.
They weren't killed there.
The preacher's car was clean,
so there's no way he transported bodies in it.
So you were right.
He was being framed. But by whom?
The answer's in the victims.
Belinda Clark and Jesse Moore
were both tied to prostitution like the others.
Travis Henson was a regular at the pool hall,
but he didn't work there.
See, I don't get why the preacher
didn't just come clean with you.
He was a narcissistic sociopath who was cornered,
but he still thought that he could get away with it.
Once he started shooting, he made his decision.
Coming clean was no longer an option.
Guys, I don't think he was the first one to shoot.
Whoever set him up was there.
That's ballsy. What makes you think that?
Because I'm pretty sure
that Reid and I heard the first shots fired.
We were all outside of that diner.
Anybody got any photos?
Yeah. I downloaded the crime scene photos.
All right, show me Coleman.
Right here.
Where's my vest? I want to show you something.
All right.
You see these?
That's from a mac-10.
Now look at this.
You see how the impact mushrooms out?
That's from a semi-jacketed hydra-shok round.
It makes a high-pitched scream.
And I know that I heard it.
That's law enforcement issue.
Friendly fire?
No. All those cops were shooting into the diner.
The round came from the same direction as the preacher.
Ok, I don't know who shot first,
but I do know that every victim's connected to the pool hall.
The only one missing is Dinah.
Go find her.
What are you doing, Dinah?
Come on, Owen.
Just let me be.
I'm not stubborn like the preacher.
I won't give you any trouble.
You know I ain't gonna say nothin'.
Oh, I know you better not.
Please.
Owen, I won't tell anyone.
I swear.
Let's go. Come on.
Ok. Ok, ok, ok.
Move it.
Agent.
How is he?
Incredibly lucky.
Two millimeters to the right
and the bullet would have torn through the carotid artery.
It nicked some smaller vessels,
but we've stopped the bleeding.
You can see him now.
Hey, how is he?
Great.
Thanks, Alex.
Bye.
Spence is in recovery.
Good.
The kid's too smart to die.
Probably rerouted the bullets by power of suggestion.
I was scared.
Yeah, I was, too.
Well, it looks like she packed a few things
before someone forced their way in here.
Truck's still out front.
She strike you as the mothering type?
Well, if you pay her for it. Why?
She has this framed.
It was in the bottom of her bag,
so that probably means it was one of the first things she packed.
It must be very important to her.
Yeah, Hotch. She's gone,
but it doesn't look like she went willingly.
No, she didn't.
Meet us at the station.
Right.
Where did you guys find her?
Trying to get out of town.
Deputy McGregor found her flying down Route 13.
When he pulled her over, she resisted arrest.
I'd like to talk to deputy McGregor.
Well, he's back out there. What do you need to know?
What was she driving?
He didn't say. Her truck, I presume. Why?
Just curious.
Well, it doesn't matter much.
It looks like we got her now.
She's gotta be behind all this.
Probably got tired of the preacher controlling her
and pulled a power play.
I'm sure you guys have a proper word
for that kind of behavior.
Devious.
Excuse me, folks.
Dinah's truck was still at her place.
We need to talk to her.
Happy to do it.
Hi, Dinah.
Sometimes investigators suffer from a form of tunnel vision.
especially when one of their own gets killed.
They stop asking questions
and start to frame the case around their theory.
Do you know what they think?
They think that you did all of it,
not just the preacher, but the sheriff
and all of the girls, too.
But here's the thing.
I don't think you wanted those girls to die.
And you were scared for those girls.
Because you were one of them.
Weren't you?
Dinah, you can tell me whatever it is you are afraid of.
I will protect you.
You can protect me?
We have federal jurisdiction.
Who was the little boy in the picture frame?
He's like 7 years old?
You're wasting your time.
I got nothin' to say to you.
With all due respect, agent,
she's here under resisting arrest charges,
and my guess is there's a hell of a lot more that'll stick.
See? Tunnel vision.
The thing about tunnels--
they can get real dark real fast.
I'm gonna take care of my case now.
So if you don't mind...
Well, she's definitely afraid,
but got defiant when Bennett walked in.
You get anything about the kid?
Nothing but a look of desperation.
If she has someone to lose,
they hold all the cards.
Outside.
So Garcia did some digging
and it turns out that Travis Henson,
the third victim from the diner,
was also a confidential informant.
For Coleman?
No.
For a decorated deputy named Owen Mcgregor.
You mean the same deputy who arrested Dinah
but didn't stick around to book her?
It explains the hydra-shok rounds found in Coleman
and why all the victims were afraid.
Each one reported "they" were gonna get them.
What if "they" is more than just this Owen Mcgregor?
What if it's the whole force?
I'm telling you, Coleman was not a dirty cop.
No, but he's only been sheriff for a year.
So he's the outsider. That's what got him killed.
It's a massive body count. What the hell are they protecting?
A way of life?
Corruption like this can make a lot of people a lot of money.
And you never met this Mcgregor?
He'd just finished his 4/40 when we landed.
Convenient.
He's back on the clock now.
Where would he go?
Bad news. That agent's gonna make it.
You need my help?
No.
I'll take care of it.
It'll be so great if he wakes up...
and this is the first thing he sees.
Yeah.
The good doctor will always make him smile.
It'd be really great if he wakes up
and we're all--ooh-- staring at him.
So, I'm gonna go stand over here.
What's wrong?
Trust no one, my friend.
Why?
Corruption.
Something this organized needs a strong leader.
We think it's deputy Owen Mcgregor.
And there's a second-in-command who appears trustworthy
but has the access and the skill set to do a lot of damage.
Deputy Bennett is presenting as that.
They framed the preacher and Dinah.
She's still alive and terrified.
She ran the prostitution ring with the preacher,
but she must play a bigger part in the rest of this.
She's clearly worth more alive than dead.
For now.
We could offer her something,
get her to trust us.
We've seen this before.
We find her kid and maybe she'll talk.
Let's see if Garcia can find him.
The rest of us need to figure out who else is involved.
Hey, Garcia.
Hi. I found juice, broth, and jell-o.
Super bland, but he needs the calories.
When this comes off, I'm gonna look just like Boris Karloff.
Yeah. A little green makeup
and you'll have the best halloween costume ever.
Everybody's fine. Don't worry.
I'm not.
You've got that furrowed brow.
Will you look who's still awake.
Can you tell her she can go now, please?
I'm ok, Alex. Go help the team.
All right. I'm out of here.
I'm glad you're awake.
Thank you.
Juice, broth, or Jell-O!
Jell-O, my favorite.
You guys were out there a long time.
Anything we should know about?
Just getting some fresh air.
Dinah didn't claim any dependents
when she filed her tax returns.
Bonus points for checking in with Uncle Sam.
At least that part of her life's in order.
She's from around here. Mom lives 10 miles away.
This is weird.
Her mom has a first-grader enrolled at Buckingham Elementary.
What are the chances a 78-year old
has a first-grader?
What's his name?
Josh.
I'm sending all the information out.
All right, thanks, Garcia.
Eat that.
So Garcia tracked down Dinah's son,
who's living close to here, but, um,
I've got eyes all over me, so someone else should go.
How's Dr. Reid?
He's awake. He's gonna be fine.
That's good to hear.
What's wrong?
Let's take a car ride. I'll fill you in.
JJ, send us the info.
Will do.
We knew Coleman had only been here a year,
but get this.
He replaced a sheriff who also died.
Of what?
Allergic reaction to medication.
He was in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound.
Who shot him?
Got away.
Report says it was a drug raid
that ended in automatic gunfire.
Who wrote that report?
Owen McGregor.
So the old sheriff realized that his office was corrupt.
They staged a murder. That sounds familiar.
Then if the prostitutes witnessed it
and threatened to tell,
that's what got them killed.
On what date did the sheriff die?
It says here March 20, a year ago.
The same day as the first victim Lucas Wagner.
So Owen's had a whole year to figure out his end game.
It all started on that night.
You need to see if you can get Dinah talking,
and you need to find out everything you can about Owen McGregor.
What was that about?
Just seeing if she wanted to talk.
A person like Dinah's gotta have some demons.
It's like she was born into bad choices.
Hey, did you get it?
That's the cop we're looking for.
That way?
Affirmative.
He's right there, isn't he?
He's at the nurses station.
Oh, I gotta get back to Reid.
Garcia, get in that room and shut the door.
Ok, I did that. Now what?
I need you to focus and I need you to listen to me.
Can you do that?
Yes. Yes. I can do that! I can do that!
Is there a wheelchair in the room?
Yes.
Get Reid in it!
That is not gonna be easy.
Then get his patient bag. His gun is in there.
Oh, my God! What?
Penelope, I need you to get out in that hallway.
You ok?
Relieved.
I thought it was gonna be the worst day.
I was so afraid Reid wasn't gonna make it.
Yeah, but he did.
And look at us now.
We're gonna go protect a kid
and give his mom another chance.
Yeah. Doesn't get much better.
Dirty cops doesn't get much worse.
It's funny about this job, isn't it?
The extremes.
Yeah. Well, it's always been that way.
One of the best days of my career
turned out to be one of the worst.
July 16, 1983.
Child abduction turned murder.
The guy we nabbed killed 5 boys,
and they were cases we had already tracked.
It was such a victory
in knowing that we'd stopped him from hurting anyone else.
When I got home, my bags were packed.
Carolyn had had enough.
I had forgotten our anniversary
again.
As well as all the other little things
that didn't seem important because...
saving lives trumped everything.
So I let ours die.
That's the great balance of life.
Always finds a way to knock your legs away.
What the hell?
They're headed to get the kid.
What are you talking about?
They figured it out.
I knew I should have handled this myself.
If you can, make your way to the exit.
Not the elevator, please.
What do you want us to do?
Kill them.
Thought you said it doesn't get any worse.
Until it does.
Are they really gonna shoot Federal Agents?
They're cops who'd rather die than get locked up.
They're desperate.
She's coming to you.
Have you got one in the chamber?
Yep.
Let's roll.
They rammed us.
We got off a few rounds.
They got away.
We--we messed up.
We got a 10-71 on Highway 17. All units respond.
The safe house isn't too far away.
And Dinah will be waiting for us?
Well, we may get there first.
Hey, Josh, can I take a photo for your mom?
OK. Now, you want to give me a big smile?
Great. OK, go ahead.
He's with agents now.
Oh, my God.
Do you agree to cooperate?
Yes. Just get me the hell out of here.
Let's go.
I've got orders she's not to leave the premises.
You can tell your boss she's leaving with me.
You tell yours she's not.
Let go of me.
Unless you want to arrested for obstruction
of a federal investigation, let her go.
He's gone, right?
He is gone. They're letting us back in.
All right, good. You did it, baby girl.
I lost a couple karma points,
but, uh-huh, I did it.
All right, I will be there in about 5 minutes.
I know you and the first victims
witnessed deputy Owen kill the former sheriff.
Why did he spare you?
When he looks at me, he sees dollar signs.
He runs everything through the pool hall and I don't say a word,
'cause if I did, he'd hurt my son.
And he's got a lot of help.
I mean, even if people aren't getting paid off,
they're all too scared to say anything.
So the whole force knows?
Enough of them.
What's he dealing?
Everything.
He gets all the product he can
and then sells it to the higher bidder.
Where did he get it.
Steals it.
He even smuggles people across the border.
What are they gonna do?
He wears a badge, they don't.
Where would deputy McGregor go now
that he knows we're closing in?
To a junkyard he controls on the edge of town.
He's final move's going to be a distraction.
Like what?
You ok?
Yeah. I'm just really tired.
Of course you are. You need to get some sleep.
Oh, but how can you sleep? 'Cause you're in a hospital
where people are always poking you.
He had his meds an hour ago.
Yeah, post-op antibiotics.
Yeah, he had those, too.
Which ones?
Carbenicillin? No, that's not right.
I have a severe reaction to beta lactams.
I can't have that.
That's not in your chart.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Garcia! He has a gun!
He's moving.
Ok.
I didn't know how loud.
I can't hear, 'cause my heart
feels like it's gonna come out.
Can that happen?
Physically, can your heart burst out of your chest?
And what is this ringing?
My ears don't pop for like a week after I fly,
and if this is like that, that's gonna drive me bonkers.
Am I yelling? Because it feels like I might be yelling.
You saved my life.
Can you hear me?
Yeah, I heard that. That makes it better.
Thank you for saying that.
Thank you for doing it.
Ok. You're ok.
Oh, Josh.
Oh, my sweet boy.
The closest federal support is an hour away.
I've called the rangers.
How long for them?
30 minutes.
Hey, Morgan. Is everyone ok?
Everything's fine. Don't worry.
It was all a big distraction.
It's gotta be part of McGregor's end game.
He's headed to a junkyard. I'll send you the address.
FBI!
Ok. It's ok.
It's gonna be ok.
Huh. Look at this.
It's a booked flight.
Maybe with the year we've all had,
uh, the brass will give us a bigger plane, you know.
Yeah. Let me know how that goes.
What did the rangers think?
Sadly, they've seen this before.
They're going to have their hands full cleaning the place up.
Hotch, don't tell me we have another case.
Are we turning the plane around?
No.
No, we're gonna go home and get some sleep.
Lots of it, I hope.
I am starting now.
You sure you're ok?
I feel great.
Ah, that's overselling it.
I, uh, I feel great
considering I just got shot in the neck.
Where do you want this?
Any -- right there is fine.
Ok. So, you should get some sleep.
You all right?
Yesterday touched a nerve
saw you like that.
Who's Ethan?
My son.
He was 9 when he died.
Doctors said it was neurological,
but they didn't have a name for it.
Still don't. That drove me crazy.
No word to put to this thing
that took away my greatest love.
I'm sorry.
He kept growing despite his disease.
The last time I lay beside him,
he was almost as long as me.
He was ready to go.
But I wasn't ready to say good-bye.
I begged him to open his eyes.
And the cruelest part was that I could see
who he would be at 20,
but I knew he'd never get there.
Ethan is a great name.
It means enduring.
It's fitting.
You and James never let go of one another.
Have you ever had that feeling
that your future is somehow behind you?
All the time.
I did, too.
But it isn't.
Ethan would have been a lot like you.
Thank you for being there when I woke up.
That meant a lot.
Of course.
Bye, Alex.
