previously on the good wife ...
neil gross .
i &apos;m ceo of chumhum .
chumhum is a worldwide company ,
like yahoo , google , facebook ;
they do business in canada , mexico , china .
peter florrick has offered me
the vacated illinois supreme court seat
if he wins the governorship .
i &apos;m in .
with agos / florrick ?
florrick / agos .
look , we can &apos;t keep skulking around .
we have to cut the cord at some point .
people want to wait for bonuses .
our client , mr. marwat ,
was a translator in afghanistan .
his daughter was dying from dysentery .
i brought him medicine , that &apos;s all .
i took it to his home in badula qulp .
hi .
hey , it &apos;s me .
i can &apos;t believe jim . he was acting so weird .
i know . what &apos;s all that middle eastern stuff
he was talking about ?
have you seen team america ?
it &apos;s so cool . i saw it last night .
&quot; dinka dinka jihad jihad dinka ... &quot;
how about when they say &quot; weapons ... &quot;
i should probably be there about ten , 15 minutes .
this sewer kind of smells .
it smells like sarin gas or something like that .
so i &apos;m thinking ...
yeah , i went to taliban down the street .
the cover charge is just outrageous . i mean ...
so , i &apos;m doing a chumhum search on al @-@ qaeda ,
and i started thinking , you think this puts me on a list ...

diane lockhart
hey , i need a translation .
i need a translation .
is it a new call ?
no , it &apos;s two years old .
then send it downstairs .
they mentioned one of the lockhart / gardner lawyers .
it &apos;s two years old .
some of us are working present @-@ day here , okay ?
i understand , but i think ...
well , next time . i &apos;m sure ...
i can &apos;t believe he said that .
what &apos;s wrong , david ?
the fourth @-@ years have stopped .
they &apos;ve stopped texting each other .
that &apos;s good news , isn &apos;t it ?
no . it means they &apos;ve been warned .
please . i have an appointment with the governor ,
and will is here .
you wanted to read their texts and there are no texts .
take good news as good news .
the absence of bad news is not good news .
okay , david , i have to go .
hey , alicia , where are you ?
i think in reception .
it &apos;s big . where am i going ?
i &apos;m coming to you .
$ 25 a square foot ?
i know .
you like it ?
i think it &apos;s ... a real law firm .
yeah .
let me show you your office , it &apos;s right here .
no , no , it &apos;s over here .
funny .
oh , hey , everyone , thank alicia for the heads @-@ up on the phones .
bought burners for everybody .
only use the company phones for lockhart / gardner calls .
it &apos;s ... will .
hey . shh . quiet down .
hey , will .
alicia , we have a scheduling problem here . where are you ?
lunch .
when can you get back ?
diane &apos;s heading out to a meeting on her judgeship ,
and i can &apos;t take the chumhum meeting ,
neil gross hates me .
i thought cary was taking that meeting .
he is . it &apos;s just ... they want a partner there , too .
mr. gross has expressed some concern
about cary being up to the job .
we just want the best .
sure , i &apos;ll be there .
bye .
what was that ?
will ... wants me in the chumhum meeting .
why ?
he wants a partner there .
cary , you &apos;re sure chumhum is coming with us when we leave ?
yeah . why ? what did he say ?
nothing . i just ...
due diligence .
if chumhum doesn &apos;t come with us ,
we don &apos;t have a firm .
i know .
we &apos;re fine , alicia .
i &apos;m in touch with neil gross every day .
don &apos;t worry , he &apos;s coming .
all i want to do is speak the truth ,
and i want to tell our users how little
my company &apos;s cooperated with these nsa subpoenas .
we know , and we &apos;re going ...
oh , and the nsa has asked us
over and over to provide user information
from our social networking sites .
over and over and over--
i can &apos;t tell you how much we &apos;ve pushed back .
actually , yes , i know , barney ,
i can &apos;t tell you how much we &apos;ve pushed back ,
because according to this gag order , if i do tell you ,
i will spend the next five years in prison .
could we get a copy of that , sir ?
my users think i have sent every text
and personal e @-@ mail over to the united states government .
this gag order prevents me from denying it ,
so what do i do ?
well , first good thing you did is come to us .
good . i &apos;m a good boy . so now what ?
sue them .
sue who ?
the national security agency .
sue them for what ?
anything .
the whole point is to look like they &apos;re gagging you ,
that you are the injured party .
sue them with anything . great .
that gains more billable hours for you ,
and for me gains nothing .
sue them for prior restraint .
what does that mean ?
well , the government can &apos;t ban the expression
of an idea prior to its publication .
that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing here--
stopping you from speaking with this gag order .
you have the same rights as the new york times .
and it &apos;ll also help if we can get
other social networking sites on board--
yahoo , google , sleuthway .
they &apos;re all in town for techweek .
we get them to sign on to an amicus brief
in support of your claim .
okay . good . do it .
excellent job .
thank you .
hey , kalinda .
we need help on this chumhum case .
we &apos;re suing the nsa .
okay , what do you need from me ?
well , techweek is in town ...
hey . they &apos;re suing us .
what ?
the law firm , lockhart / gardner ,
they &apos;re suing us .
you and me ?
no . the nsa .
yeah , take that one to the systems admin .
check out the link i just sent you .
you have $ 1.3 million .
now , many advisors would suggest stocks .
uh , i tend to advise interest @-@ bearing bonds .
my second husband always advised against bonds .
really ? and how long were you married to him ?
have you ever been married , mr. liebenbaum ?
uh , i have not .
but , then , i have an excuse : i &apos;m selfish .
you know what you are , mr. liebenbaum ?
hmm ?
you &apos;re a carnivore .
you &apos;re a jungle cat .
well , it &apos;s a dangerous place here on the savannah .
the cat survives .
mom . hi .
oh , hi , darling . how are you ?
good , mom . i ...
what are you doing here ?
david and i are running off together .
ha @-@ ha . we &apos;re estate planning .
i was advising bonds .
ah . uh , mom , could you come by my office ...
um , h @-@ hold on .
i &apos;ll be right back .
can you talk ? we have a problem .
not yet . hold on .
okay , what &apos;s the problem ?
we don &apos;t have the office space .
what do you mean ? we put down earnest money .
i know . and the bank loan was supposed to come through
to make up the difference ,
but the bank wanted to talk to our current employers .
will and diane ?
yeah . and we couldn &apos;t let them talk to them .
uh , mom , i &apos;ll be right out .
no , i &apos;ll just wait here . go ahead .
how did that happen ?
i don &apos;t know . john made some assumptions .
but now we need $ 140,000,
or we &apos;re out the earnest money .
the $ 60,000 we already put down ?
yeah . it sucks .
mom .
it &apos;s better by the door .
so now we need to get the full amount .
cary ... i don &apos;t have $ 140,000 .
do you have any way to get it ?
this is really wrong , cary .
i put up $ 10,000 of my own money
for that earnest money .
i know . i did , too ...
hey . we &apos;re up .
it &apos;s the marwat warrant .
fisa court warrant 30 @-@ 879 .
danny marwat .
he &apos;s an arab @-@ american translator
who worked for the military
until he was accused of collaborating with the taliban .
he hired the law firm
lockhart / gardner to defend him .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re following all these lawyers ?
just two lawyers :
alicia florrick and diane lockhart .
and we &apos;ve only gone back two years in the bit bucket .
so we have a warrant for this person of interest , marwat ,
he hires two lawyers and we &apos;ve
been listening to their calls for two years .
i don &apos;t see the problem .
well , these lawyers also represent chumhum .
yeah . this firm &apos;s all over the map .
the problem is , they &apos;re suing us .
these lawyers are ?
yeah . but not for marwat .
for chumhum .
okay , don &apos;t do that again .
so , you want to know whether ...
does our warrant restrict listening to a law firm
in active litigation with us for a non @-@ terroristic action ?
sometimes i can &apos;t tell if you &apos;re the stupidest people
in the world or the smartest .
we &apos;re the smartest .
okay , i &apos;ll check with counsel ,
and in the meantime , if anyone refers to this chumhum suit ,
mark it down as a possible omit .
thank you , sir .
we respect you greatly , sir .
hey , have any of these lawyers done anything illegal ?
not yet .
i mean , not glaringly yet .
uh , the one lawyer , florrick ,
her husband &apos;s about to be governor of illinois .
what ?
yeah , in about a month .
alicia &apos;s wondering what to wear to the inaugural .
all right , keep an eye on this .
we can direct justice to illegality these days .
maybe this case can prove its worth in another way .
any illegality ?
any illegality .
by the governor ?
by anyone .
you &apos;re the smartest people in the world ,
don &apos;t limit yourselves .
real hostile energy .
well , i &apos;ve wrapped
a three @-@ iron around a tree many a time , so ...
so ... do you think you can get behind this , chief justice ?
this ?
diane lockhart &apos;s nomination
for the supreme court seat .
we &apos;d like to announce tonight . if that &apos;s possible .
how did you like my gift , mr. governor @-@ elect ?
&quot; fiat justitia ruat caelum &quot;
the engraved gavel . he loved it .
it was supposed to be back here today , sir .
we are having it mounted .
yeah , i &apos;m gonna hang it on the wall there .
words to live by .
&quot; fiat justitia ruat caelum . &quot;
&quot; let justice be done though the heavens fall &quot;
it &apos;s beautiful .
okay , so , diane lockhart ?
we &apos;d like you to attend a press conference tonight .
diane lockhart is a perfectly charming woman
with an unobjectionably appropriate resume ,
who , when i met her ,
took every opportunity to defend
her perfectly corrupt legal partner .
and you &apos;d like her to ... ?
explain herself .
publicly .
i want to know why her firm
still represents chicago &apos;s top drug dealer .
i want to know
how she disagrees with her disbarred partner .
i want what you want , sir .
&quot; fiat justitia ruat .. &quot;
oh , this is such idiotic crap .
you don &apos;t want her because you &apos;re a sexist old fool .
eli !
and you are a rude backroom huckster .
but that is irrelevant to this .
chief justice ,
diane lockhart is my choice .
it is so good to see you , sir .
well , this is a pleasant surprise .
how nice to ...
chief justice ...
no , no , no , don &apos;t get up .
what do you want to do ?
well , we can &apos;t lose him .
it &apos;ll cost us too much politically .
i &apos;ll tell diane we &apos;re delaying .
see if you can give him what he wants , for god &apos;s sakes .
done .
what about this gift ? this gavel ?
have you lost it ?
no .
it &apos;s probably in the gift room with the other 900 presents .
i &apos;ll make sure it &apos;s out here the next time you see him .
mounted .
mm @-@ hmm .
it &apos;s a gold @-@ plated gavel
given to the governor by the chief justice , with latin on it .
mr. gold , remember damian the intern ?
no .
the one in the hawaiian shirt ?
oh , yes , the one i fired .
what ?
well , he was in here , in the gift room ,
and i &apos;m just guessing ...
he took it ?
i just checked on clarkswap , and look .
890美元
call him , arrange a meeting .
don &apos;t say who it is .
just say i &apos;m interested , and i want to inspect it .
so any word from google ?
no .
yahoo ?
no .
facebook ?
no .
is this 20 questions , kalinda ?
no .
so ... sleuthway , patric edelstein ?
yes .
ah .
edelstein will support our amicus brief ?
no .
kalinda ... what do you have ?
clearly you have something ,
because i can see the file under your arm .
when are you leaving ?
to start our own firm ?
soon . why ?
well , you &apos;re putting me in an awkward position .
it &apos;s not my intent .
you intend on taking neil gross
and chumhum with you as clients , right ?
you &apos;re improving your position
at the expense of lockhart / gardner .
no .
i &apos;m doing my job as a lawyer at lockhart / gardner .
kalinda , what do you have ?
something for lockhart / gardner ,
not agos &amp; associates .
kalinda , this is a lockhart / gardner case .
any money derived from it stays at lockhart / gardner ,
so whatever you have helps lockhart / gardner .
you have to change your strategy .
yes , yes .
i heard your argument ,
and i was mightily impressed , but no .
prior restraint doesn &apos;t apply here .
the second circuit has ruled
that nsa subpoenas are legal ,
and gag orders are required for national security .
that ruling wasn &apos;t precedential , your honor .
oh , yes , it was , and you want to know why ?
because i just said so .
so , if there &apos;s no other business before this court ...
just-- excuse me ,
your honor , just one more matter .
what might ... ? i know you .
you were just in here last week .
yes .
good to see you again .
lovely to see you .
what , you &apos;re the only lawyer in town ?
no . we just had so much fun last time ,
we thought we &apos;d do it again .
actually , counselor ,
i &apos;m the one who makes the jokes here , not you .
apologies , your honor .
your honor ,
we &apos;d like to change our suit to one of selective enforcement .
your honor , is the plaintiff really accusing
the united states of selectively enforcing its gag order ?
we are , and we &apos;d like to call a witness .
tingles , counselor ... tingles .
patric edelstein .
i &apos;m ceo of the social networking site sleuthway .
and you were just served a subpoena at techweek today ?
yes .
thank you , neil .
uh , what is the size of sleuthway , mr. edelstein ?
the size ?
900 million users , and growing .
and you have been served with fisa warrants
to grant access to your users &apos; e @-@ mails
and chatting functions , isn &apos;t that ...
objection , your honor . all discussions of
hypothetical fisa court warrants are ,
in fact , classified and cannot be discussed here .
as kafkaesque as that sounds , i will sustain .
have you ever
been served with a gag order regarding the nsa &apos;s requests--
sorry-- hypothetical requests for access to users &apos; data ?
no .
thank you , sir .
sorry .
that was just preamble .
we can do so much with technology ,
and yet , when i was served with a warrant , i caved .
we gave the nsa e @-@ mails , data , phone calls .
not that many . less than a hundred .
but still , we gave it to them .
rip into him .
definitely .
so that was you , right ?
yes .
and you were discussing the extent
of your cooperation with the nsa ?
do you mind voicing your answer ?
yes , i was .
and did you receive
a cease and desist letter from the nsa after that talk ?
no .
were you warned of your gag order
either before or after that talk ?
no .
were there nsa recruiters in the audience of that talk ?
okay , okay , okay .
i get it .
selective enforcement .
and i &apos;m prone to let this suit go forward ,
unless the government has something up its sleeve .
we request a recess , your honor .
of course you do .
what time did you say ?
3 o &apos;clock . he &apos;s late .
you &apos;re not gonna make a scene , are you , mr. gold ?
no , i &apos;m gonna get my gavel back
and scare the hell out of mr. hawaiian shirt .
i &apos;m not gonna ...
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , mr. gold . hello .
i should have known .
i &apos;m not as fast as i used to be .
oh . i see .
you &apos;re my clarkswap contact .
you can go now , deborah .
she seems a little young for you , mr. gold .
so , zach took the gavel home ,
you stole it , and now you &apos;re selling it ?
no . i am selling it , for $ 890 .
i found it at the flea market under a stack of old pottery .
it &apos;s amazing
what you can find at the flea market these days .
and it &apos;s just a coincidence
you found the gavel belonging to the father of your boyfriend ?
zach &apos;s not my boyfriend .
i &apos;m in college now .
i don &apos;t really have time for high school seniors .
becca , i work for the governor now .
i &apos;m his chief of staff .
congratulations .
you can &apos;t steal from the governor .
you &apos;ll be arrested .
excuse me , mr. gold .
that &apos;ll be $ 890 .
oh , no , no , dear becca .
my gift to you is you not being arrested .
no , mr. gold .
only one of us is taking something they haven &apos;t paid for .
excuse me , officer ?
hello .
yeah ?
could you help me out ?
i @-@ i &apos;m a student here ,
and this man is trying to take one of my father &apos;s antiques ,
and he won &apos;t pay me for it .
are you serious ?
officer , uh , my name is eli gold ...
sir , are you a student here ?
peter and i have a problem , alicia .
and it &apos;s going to become my problem , eli ?
uh , i mean , yes .
it &apos;s about zach &apos;s girlfriend , becca .
hey , frick and frack , let &apos;s go .
and so , our question is ,
does this lawsuit change anything ,
or can we continue our surveillance ?
last time a person of interest
contacted these lawyers was two years ago ?
you mean danny marwat ? yes .
and you &apos;re a two @-@ hop warrant ?
yup . we can go from marwat to his lawyer
to his lawyer &apos;s contacts , that &apos;s all .
and this has taken you to the governor @-@ elect of illinois ?
well , yeah , but we &apos;re not actively pursuing him .
doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re going into the governor &apos;s mansion ,
you need a more recent terrorist connection .
get it to me in 36 hours ,
and we &apos;ll take it to the fisa court .
wait , wait . that &apos;s not why we brought this to you .
it was about the lawsuit .
i don &apos;t have any issue with the lawsuit .
my issue is taking a two @-@ hop programmatic warrant into
the governor &apos;s mansion .
thank edward snowden .
everybody &apos;s cracking down now .
why do you guys care ?
move on to one of your other cases .
i don &apos;t know . we were getting interested .
well , then find a more recent terrorist connection .
okay , here we are .
we &apos;re back together . what do you have , bobby ?
bobby ? bobby , i intend to move this suit forward ,
unless you guys got something .
we do , your honor .
we request a very brief scif .
uh , excuse me , your honor .
a what ?
scif . s @-@ c @-@ i @-@ f .
sensitive compartmented information facility .
for the communication of classified information .
this is really necessary , counselor ?
it is , your honor .
the matter is quite sensitive .
okay .
i have no choice but to move this into the courthouse &apos;s scif .
uh , excuse me , your honor .
plaintiff &apos;s counsel doesn &apos;t have
security clearance for this scif .
excuse me ?
the data to be imparted is highly classified ,
and it requires a security clearance
only available to his honor .
your honor , the ausa cannot just determine who can ...
your honor , this is ridiculous ! this is not a fisa court !
okay , okay , okay !
i know you &apos;re outraged , but he &apos;s right .
you don &apos;t have security clearance .
you have to wait in court .
we have a problem you can help us with .
we need you to do a chicago law interview tomorrow .
an interview ?
really ? on , uh , what subject ?
your work here .
putting your career in perspective .
your excitement at being considered for the judgeship .
the interviewer is mandy post .
she &apos;s good .
she won &apos;t sabotage you .
why do i feel another shoe is about to drop ?
you need to put the past behind you , diane .
and how do i do that ?
there will be questions about will .
his disbarment .
is this from the chief justice ?
yes .
he won &apos;t stand behind my nomination
unless i declare my antipathy to will ?
no .
not to will . to his past behavior .
oh .
eli , has ... any other nominee
ever been asked to disavow his or her past ?
not that i know of .
and what happens if i don &apos;t ?
peter really needs you to get the chief justice on your side .
so i trash will or i &apos;m not nominated ?
no .
trash his past .
oh , of course .
this is insane . we can &apos;t just ...
after a discussion in scif with ausa hortense ,
i rule ...
for the government .
uh , excuse me , your honor , that &apos;s crazy .
you haven &apos;t even heard our rebuttal .
what rebuttal ?
you weren &apos;t even privy to the government &apos;s argument .
that &apos;s because we were left out here .
all right , now listen to me .
if you are arguing , mrs. florrick ,
that this is absurd , i &apos;ll agree with you .
but if you are arguing that this is illegal , unfortunately
you are wrong .
lawsuit based on selective enforcement is denied .
court is adjourned .
i &apos;m pissed .
good . use it .
i just don &apos;t understand .
you said you didn &apos;t want to see anyone .
nisa , listen to me . i &apos;m not seeing becca .
you have to stop calling .
who &apos;s nisa ?
zach &apos;s old girlfriend .
oh , that cute little black girl . i liked her .
you &apos;re not supposed to say &quot; black . &quot;
it &apos;s &quot; african @-@ american . &quot;
but i guess she &apos;s somalian , so i don &apos;t know .
somalian ? wow .
what are you guys doing ?
we bought clothes . some very , very pretty clothes .
mom &apos;s not gonna like that .
oh , sure she is .
she wore this kind of thing in high school .
except it had rips in it .
her father said it looked like a young man &apos;s rape fantasy .
wouldn &apos;t let her wear it .
but she found a way .
how &apos;d she find a way ?
she put them in my car and changed on the way to school .
now , makeup . you &apos;re gonna want to wear more than you should .
what happened to christian grace ?
thought you were religious .
i &apos;m just getting stuff for school .
now , now . jesus has no problem with grace looking her best .
that &apos;s what jesus believed in .
here .
that &apos;s nisa .
i &apos;m letting it ring .
is anyone answering the phone ?
it &apos;s nisa ; we &apos;re letting it ring .
oh , hey , mom . how was shopping ?
oh , so much fun .
grace got three dresses .
you know she wears a uniform ; she doesn &apos;t need dresses .
well , she does for dances .
am i going to approve of these ?
they &apos;re perfectly appropriate evening attire for a young lady .
i &apos;m gonna start drinking .
pour me one , too .
hey , cary .
any thoughts on chumhum ?
not yet .
but thanks so much . this is ... this is incredible .
uh , what &apos;s incredible ?
your check .
my check ?
that i wrote for the $ 60,000 contribution ?
no , your check for $ 140,000 .
we got the offices , and you will get
first out with interest from all the other partners .
cary , i didn &apos;t give you a check .
you did . yeah , the envelope , it &apos;s from you .
okay , what @-@ what &apos;s the name on the check ?
it &apos;s a ... a trust . ivy road trust .
alicia .
where do you keep your earrings ?
look , i heard you on the phone , and i wanted to help .
but , mom , that &apos;s a lot of money .
oh , i know it is . it &apos;s my money , i want to spend it .
but you &apos;re ... this is crazy .
yeah , consider it a loan .
if you pay me back in six months , i won &apos;t come after you .
mom ... what &apos;s this about ?
why does everything have to be about something ?
can &apos;t someone just be nice ?
okay , if it makes you feel better ,
you have to have dinner with me .
i &apos;ve met someone .
who ?
michael barnwright . very nice widower .
retired .
he used to race dogs .
okay , good . dinner .
okay , next adventure .
mom , i &apos;m not seeing becca .
look , it &apos;s about the governor &apos;s mansion .
people are going to want things from you .
and not even big things .
little things like this gavel .
why does everybody think i &apos;m seeing becca ?
i haven &apos;t seen her since she went off to college .
mom , i told her that i never wanted to see her again .
then how did she get dad &apos;s gavel from the apartment ?
what &apos;s wrong with this blush ?
that is not even blush .
that is grandma blush .
throw it away .
for your skin , you need a skin illuminator .
obviously , you are aware of the rumors
floating around that you are next in line
for state supreme court .
if i had a dollar for every time i &apos;ve been rumored for something .
but right now , i &apos;m just trying to run my law practice .
coming out of bankruptcy helped .
yes , definitely .
it wasn &apos;t just bankruptcy , was it ?
i mean , you were also dealing with the suspension of a name partner .
yes , um ...
that was a ... tough period for us .
but we got through it .
and you kept will gardner &apos;s name on the letterhead .
was there ever any thought to taking it off ?
i , um ... i won &apos;t say the question never came up ,
but , um ... here we are .
you don &apos;t sound thrilled about it .
wasn &apos;t it almost disbarment ?
will gardner &apos;s suspension , i mean .
i &apos;m probably not the best person to ask about that .
so you don &apos;t harbor any resentment at your partner
for almost single @-@ handedly destroying your firm ?
our firm .
correction . your firm .
will gardner single @-@ handedly
won five of this firm &apos;s top awards .
he &apos;s the reason we survived bankruptcy .
by bending the law ?
by using it .
by understanding its limits and its complications .
and by using everything he can , within the law ,
to win cases .
really ?
yes .
oh , wait .
i didn &apos;t even turn this on .
silly me .
shall we start over again ?
okay , now what ?
my west coast lawyers are suggesting
that it was mistake to try this
in the midwest from your offices .
your west coast lawyers are saying this ?
really ?
oh , what do you think , ben ?
this kid thinks he can take you .
the seventh circuit is very sympathetic to business issues .
and it was our mistake
to take a constitutional argument to them .
when you lose with the constitution , try money .
okay . and how do we do that ?
interference with prospective economic gain , your honor .
really ?
the government is interfering with
mr. gross &apos;s economic gain by ... ?
ruining his company &apos;s good name with his customers .
your honor , the federal tort claims act ...
specifically allows for suits for damages against the government .
not if the government employees in question
were acting in a discretionary capacity .
then produce someone from the nsa , so we can ask them
if they were acting in a discretionary capacity .
got you there , bobby .
your honor , i have to request we go back into the scif .
mm , no , no , counselor .
this isn &apos;t about national security ; this is about money .
what damages is chumhum claiming ?
$ 3 billion .
what ?
that &apos;s the amount of stock value chumhum has lost
due to its forced association with the nsa .
okay .
we &apos;ll hear testimony tomorrow .
hey , mom .
where &apos;s your date ?
he isn &apos;t coming .
margarita ?
is everything all right ?
no .
he &apos;s going back to his wife .
i thought you said he was a widower .
he was .
i guess she didn &apos;t die .
oh , come on . have a margarita . let &apos;s get drunk .
maybe your good mood will rub off on me .
oh , mom , i &apos;m so sorry .
no , no , no .
the worst thing in the world is to have someone feel sorry for you .
you remember that ?
i used to do that to you when you were five .
i know . and i didn &apos;t understand it then .
you know what i don &apos;t understand about you ?
why i ever divorced your father ?
no . i mean ... yeah .
but we &apos;ll save that for another time .
you never liked me as a kid .
i mean , you like my kids now , but ...
but you never really liked me .
i liked you .
no .
we never did anything together .
i think you liked owen .
and i was a likable kid .
people liked me .
god ... if we could just start over ,
do everything just all over again from the beginning .
me , too . i think we &apos;d be better at it now .
don &apos;t make me cry .
i &apos;m the one who should be crying . i &apos;m alone .
oh , mom . oh ...
okay . okay .
that &apos;s enough .
so you blame the nsa for losing you 20 % of your user base ?
yes .
and there was no other reason for the loss of so many users ?
not in such sizable amounts .
and on what date did you see the beginning of this ...
&quot; sizable &quot; loss of users ?
well , i would trace it to the edward snowden leak around june 10 .
thank you , mr. gross . no further questions .
i &apos;d like to call simon fishbein .
simon fishbein ?
who &apos;s that , your podiatrist ?
i &apos;m simon fishbein .
oh , yes , sir . i &apos;m sorry , sir .
nice to meet you . would you please join us ?
you were once a user
of mr. gross &apos;s networking site , mr. fishbein ?
i was . it was a good way of keeping up with my grandkids .
ten grandkids and three great @-@ grandkids .
each generation is having fewer and fewer kids .
have you noticed ?
oh , i have , sir .
but you quit chumhum ?
why is that , mr. fishbein ?
they allowed holocaust deniers to organize on their site .
and why is that a problem for you ?
well ...
let the record reflect that mr. fishbein has just exhibited
a numbered tattoo from auschwitz .
now , you &apos;re not the only camp survivor to be offended
by these holocaust denier pages , are you ?
no , there &apos;s a group of us . we meet every month at manny &apos;s .
we sent a letter to this putz here , gross .
your parents should be ashamed of you .
mr. fishbein , i &apos;m sorry , but it &apos;s free speech .
we don &apos;t take down objectionable content ...
you forced a breast @-@ feeding support group to take down
a page that had instructional photographs ...
there &apos;s no cross @-@ talk .
so , did anything come of your writing mr. gross ?
we got a nice letter back--
they spelled my name wrong .
but they didn &apos;t take down the pages .
so we contacted the zionist defense council ,
and they organized a boycott .
and when was that boycott organized ?
june 10 .
the same day mr. gross pointed to his losing users .
so we can &apos;t really be sure why users are leaving chumhum .
objection . counselor is testifying .
all right , i &apos;ll give it to you . have fun with it .
sustained .
thoughts ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i didn &apos;t do it .
oh , that part i understand .
what i don &apos;t understand is why .
she kept fishing .
it was like she wanted me to sell will out .
yes , people fish because the fish are biting .
everyone knows about will &apos;s troubles .
he &apos;s my partner .
we built this firm together .
i mean , that means something .
i hope it means everything ,
because that &apos;s what you &apos;ve traded it for .
i want to be on the court , eli , of course i do ,
but i can &apos;t betray will , not like that .
hardly matters now .
what &apos;s done is done .
where are you going ?
to put together a short list for the supreme court .
north korea ?
yeah . apparently , the u.s. government
is investigating neil gross because he had a meeting
with some north korean nationals in seoul last year .
and how do we know this ?
one of robyn &apos;s contacts at the treasury .
so that &apos;s why he &apos;s being singled out
and not edelstein or any of the others ?
looks like that .
the man never ceases to amaze me .
it was a pro @-@ democracy group .
north korean dissidents , they wanted us to help them
with , uh , equipment-- cell phones , encryption software .
civilians or government officials ?
some of both . why ?
because if they were government officials ,
they can get you under the foreign corrupt practices act .
you know , it was the good guys i was talking to ,
the ones who were against kim jong @-@ un .
maybe you can argue that in court .
what is your problem ?
clearly , i don &apos;t have one .
i was trying to help the north koreans until they backed out .
why &apos;d they back out ?
&apos;cause they were afraid of the nsa ,
the same as everybody else .
did you give them this technology for free ?
at @-@ at cost .
but they were supposed to pay you ?
yeah . why ?
because if they were supposed to pay you ,
then you have damages .
sorry .
david , can this wait ? i &apos;m in a meeting .
it &apos;s about your mother , you tell me .
i &apos;m concerned about her .
i know , it surprises me , too .
i think she &apos;s making investment decisions
without understanding the consequences .
what do you mean ?
well , i got off the phone with her broker just now .
she wrote a check for $ 140,000,
and he doesn &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
you wouldn &apos;t have any idea what it &apos;s about ?
no idea .
because i looked up the check online .
as her advisor , i have access to her account .
it was written out
to a threshold commercial realty here in chicago .
she &apos;s probably making an investment .
i told her real estate is a bad idea .
well ... she &apos;s coming in in a minute . we &apos;ll talk .
uh , she &apos;s coming in today ?
yes , in a few minutes .
come on , mom .
mom . where are you ?
i &apos;m in the car ; coming to your offices to see david .
yes . david &apos;s gonna ask you about the check you wrote for me ,
and i need you to tell him that it &apos;s an investment .
it is an investment .
no . but it can &apos;t be an investment for me .
you can &apos;t ...
hey , did you find something ?
i don &apos;t know .
another terrorist connection ?
i went back to the metadata .
forget it . i already did ; there &apos;s nothing there .
no , no . this is from yesterday .
12 calls from
a hamas sympathizer on the bolo list .
you &apos;re kidding .
to who , diane lockhart ?
no . alicia florrick .
it must be a client .
no. 12 calls to her home .
left messages on her machine .
a somali national .
what is that ?
it &apos;s , uh , taiwanese porn .
real sick stuff .
teo dalmar .
he &apos;s a financial supporter of the muharib muslim .
what was his call about ?
i don &apos;t know .
sounds like ...
crying ?
any further witnesses , mrs. florrick ?
actually , your honor ,
we ask to be heard in a scif .
you ask to be heard in a scif ?
yes . we have information of a delicate matter
that may prejudice our client with the government .
objection , your honor . the scif exists
to protect the government , not ...
the people , mr. hortense ?
well , yes , your honor .
whatever protections
the government enjoys , people should enjoy as well ,
don &apos;t you think , mr. hortense ?
overruled .
north korean dissidents ?
freedom fighters , your honor .
due to their association with the nsa ,
chumhum has lost the contract
to supply these freedom fighters with cell phones .
and other technologies .
that &apos;s why we asked to be heard in here , your honor .
since mr. gross had the temerity
to question the nsa &apos;s gag order ,
we were afraid the government may seize on any excuse to prosecute him .
even his attempts to spread democracy in north korea .
mm , heaven forfend .
so just how much was this technology contract worth ?
with the freedom fighters ?
yes .
it &apos;s $ 14,000 , your honor .
$ 14,000 ?
yeah .
that &apos;s not quite as impressive as $ 3 billion .
we would argue the nature of this intrusion into our liberties ...
save it , mrs. florrick .
we both know it &apos;s not about our liberties ,
and it &apos;s not about the money , either .
it &apos;s about the publicity value of neil gross
standing up to the nsa .
okay , let &apos;s get going . i &apos;ve made my decision ,
and no one is gonna like it .
$ 140,000 ?
i know .
it was a spontaneous investment .
i &apos;m kooky that way .
it &apos;s a suite of offices ?
yes .
a very beautiful suite of offices .
when i saw it , i just had to have it .
you did ?
yeah . gorgeous .
it &apos;s just that the commercial real estate market is so depressed ,
it &apos;s not the best time .
well ... you know how i am .
i &apos;m just a real girl with money .
well , i can call the realtor and get out of it ;
we &apos;ll put the money toward a stronger investment ...
no , no , no . i &apos;m good .
i mean , once i &apos;m committed , i &apos;m committed .
that &apos;s me .
a @-@ are you sure ? veronica , it &apos;s a lot of money ...
david .
don &apos;t do this .
it &apos;s my money .
i invested it .
i &apos;m good .
okay ?
okay .
so , appreciating the government &apos;s legitimate
national security concerns , i &apos;m gonna find
that the nsa &apos;s gag order should remain in place .
however ,
appreciating the legitimate
free enterprise concerns of mr. gross ,
i also find that chumhum has been damaged
in the amount of ... $ 14,000 .
uh , $ 14,000 ?
mm @-@ hmm . that &apos;s what i said , bobby .
$ 14,000 . you better call the general accounting office ;
it may take them a while
to raise that kind of cash . one more thing .
at the request of chumhum &apos;s counsel ,
i &apos;m going to place a gag order on any and all
discussion of damages . you got it ?
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , wh @-@ what &apos;s the point of that ?
i &apos;m very happy
to report that i &apos;ve just come back from federal court ,
where my legal team won a major victory for chumhum
against these intrusions on all of our privacy rights by the nsa !
yes .
now , um ...
due to , uh ... this gag order ,
i am not at liberty to discuss the terms of the judgment ,
but suffice to say ...
we are pretty happy today .
thank you !
hello . alicia florrick .
alicia , it &apos;s neil gross .
just wanted to thank you all .
you did a great job .
oh , thank you , mr. gross .
would you like me to get cary for you ?
no , no , no , it &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m just heading to the airport .
um , i want to make sure ...
is everything all right ?
yes .
we have permission to expand the scope .
the danny marwat warrant ?
yes . though we &apos;re more concerned
about the 12 calls you discovered
to the alicia florrick voice mail .
we didn &apos;t catch that .
so we want to expand the warrant to a three @-@ hop .
three ? really ?
yes . the proximity to the governor @-@ elect
is our concern .
we need to keep an eye on that . anything you find ,
kick it up to mr. froines and to myself .
good job .
good catch , both of you .
thank you so much for coming by again , chief justice .
certainly , eli .
what do you need ?
peter would like you to reconsider .
he would ?
reconsider what ?
your ... hesitation to the diane lockhart nomination .
well , i &apos;m not hesitant , eli .
i am concerned .
peter would like you to stop ... being concerned .
i &apos;m not sure how that happens unless ms. lockhart is ...
mr. governor @-@ elect .
virgil .
you &apos;re gonna have to reconsider .
mr. governor @-@ elect ...
no , virgil .
you &apos;re going to have to reconsider .
sir , i have strong concerns .
well , then you &apos;ll have to keep those concerns to yourself .
i know you think this is about you .
but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s about my choice .
and i &apos;m going to make my choice , whether you like it or not .
diane lockhart &apos;s office .
mr. gold , hello .
actually , diane is in a meeting at the moment .
would you like to leave a message ?
yes . tell her she does not
have to give the interview again .
everything &apos;s fine .
thank you , diane .
great interview .
no problem .
