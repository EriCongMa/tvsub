evening , ladies . gals &apos; night out ?
chasing guys , eating pie , having fun .
this table is sticky ! run a damp rag across it !
would it kill you to clean a little ?
what kinda place is this ?
the kind that serves soup cold .
and what &apos;s with your crazy earrings ?
what are you , some kinda gypsy ?
okay . whoa ! hold up , ladies .
you don &apos;t get a bitch pass just &apos; cause you &apos;re old .
yes , that &apos;s right . i said it .
you come in here with your gangster granny attitude ,
think you can get away with
dumping all over the lowly gypsy waitress .
no way .
at this diner , we don &apos;t discriminate due to age .
if you &apos;re gonna act like an ass ,
i &apos;m gonna treat you like an ass ...
no matter how close that ass is riding to the floor .
now , i &apos;ll wipe off the table we &apos;ll take it from the top .
hi , i &apos;m max . who wants tapioca ?
that &apos;s more like it .
save the disappointment for the grandkids .
earl , i need another book of checks .
the last one fell between the refrigerator and the oven .
i &apos;d reach for it , but that falls between
&quot; i don &apos;t do that &quot; and &quot; oh , hell no . &quot;
look overthere , max .
men and women in suits .
this neighborhood is definitely on the rise .
i remember a time when a black man couldn &apos;t get a cab around here .
and that time was wednesday .
max , i was just talking to the smart couples in booth two .
i know they &apos;re smart because they &apos;re the first people in here
是法国式火腿干酪热三明治
who ever ordered the croque monsieur as croque monsieur
and not &quot; crock monster . &quot;
they wanna meet the woman who made the cupcakes .
i told them you &apos;d be right over .
go ! they &apos;re so nice .
no , they &apos;re not nice .
they &apos;re trendy , blood @-@ sucking locusts
who come into this neighborhood to pillage and destroy
everything i care about .
i felt the same way when the hilton sisters
crashed my 21st birthday .
what ?
you made these cupcakes ?
yeah , what &apos;s the problem ?
spit it out , i &apos;ve got a life .
we just wanted to tell you that your flavor palate is ...
amazing .
i don &apos;t know who you are or where you came from--
neither do i.
but these are fabulous .
well , welcome to the neighborhood .
i knew i liked you guys .
so what did the trendy locusts want ?
you are so judgmental , you know that ?
they wanted to tell me the cupcakes are &quot; fabulous . &quot;
thank you .
maybe now you &apos;ll finally start to get it
if someone besides me tells you how good they are .
i believe the word was &quot; fabulous . &quot;
pick up , max .
oleg , from now on , you may call me
countess max of the fabulous cupcakes .
and you may call me sir oleg of the amazing party in my pants .
caroline , the happy , shiny people in suits
asked me to give you this note .
oh , what a great idea !
they suggested we sell max &apos;s cupcakes
at the cool new coffee place in their building .
but you already sell cupcakes here in my diner .
han , we &apos;re building a cupcake business
that will one day get us out of here .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do with our lives .
but i thought we had something special .
yes , but we &apos;re not exclusive .
the diner &apos;s cute , but i want more than this .
oof .
first girlfriend all over again .
hey , johnny .
max has the tables against the wall .
oh , we &apos;re good in your section .
caroline , i want you to meet my buddy carlos .
what &apos;s happenin &apos; ?
hi .
well , i &apos;m working the counter .
what &apos;s happenin &apos; ? come on , dude .
you have a literature degree from nyu .
i didn &apos;t mean to say that , but when i get nervous ,
my rico suave comes out .
it won &apos;t happen again .
and here &apos;s two menus .
what &apos;s happenin &apos; ?
dude , i &apos;m nervous .
hey , guys , i &apos;m in that section over there .
oh , we &apos;re good in caroline &apos;s area .
well , if you like hot coffee in your pants area ,
you &apos;re in the right place .
actually , i like that .
coming right at you .
johnny &apos;s in your section .
yeah , why ?
he comes in here every night to see you .
he &apos;s your friends or ... crush or whatever he is .
shh ! he &apos;s not a crush . he &apos;s a ...
i don &apos;t know what he is , but whatever he is ,
he &apos;s in your section .
max !
ooh ! what are you doing ?
you &apos;re not supposed to be in here .
i know , i &apos;m a bad boy .
look , the reason i &apos;m not sitting in your section
is because my buddy carlos is crushing pretty hard on caroline
and he asked me to do what i can to hook them up .
oh . so now you &apos;re a bartender ,
a street artist , and a pimp .
ain &apos;t nuttin &apos; wrong with me pimpin &apos; some boy on the side .
keeps me in spray paint and whatnot .
so ?
from pimp to pimp ...
help me out with your girl .
my girl don &apos;t come cheap .
is it hot in here ?
yes , and we &apos;re in a freezer .
yes . my freezer .
i was , uh , just talking to max .
um , i &apos;ll see you out there .
so is this what you like in the man ?
what ?
no . he &apos;s just a customer that went rogue .
he is weak and girlish .
a woman like you needs a real man .
you know what they say .
once you go ukraine , you will scream with sex pain .
that probably lost some of its sensual appeal in the translation ,
but thanks for the offer , oleg .
cute , but i &apos;m not interested .
besides , he &apos;s not my type .
just say it .
you &apos;re not interested in him because he &apos;s puerto rican .
where did you get this idea that i would only date white guys ?
for your information , i &apos;ve dated all kinds of men .
i once had a spaniard in monte carlo .
isn &apos;t the title of an abba song ?
are you sure about this ? he &apos;s cute .
and trust me , you could use a little salsa on your white rice .
max , i just lost every dollar i had .
the last thing on my mind right now is guys--
any type of guy .
except this guy .
hi , chestnut .
i &apos;m much more concerned with our business
and getting my head back above water .
men will come sooner or later .
well , according to my research most men come sooner .
oh , i thought we should stop by that new coffee place tomorrow
and introduce ourselves and your cupcakes .
i &apos;m not gonna walk in there . i feel like i &apos;m selling out .
okay , let &apos;s reframe the phrase selling out
and make it sold out , as in
&quot; max , we sold out of the cupcakes &quot;
and are now successful . &quot;
what &apos;s that you say ?
i can now afford to buy the wax dental floss again ?
fine .
but i &apos;m only doing it so you &apos;ll eventually
get your mind off the business and get laid .
why do you think i need to get laid so badly ?
if i &apos;d just gone through all the tension and trauma that just happened to you ,
i &apos;d be climbing telephone poles to take the edge off .
trust me , sex is the last thing on my mind right now .
oh , and speaking of reframing things ,
i have a surprise .
i redecorated my room .
i scoped out some cheap fabric in bedding places
down on houston street .
what do you think ?
i think you &apos;ve made a vagina .
what ?
sister , you may think that sex is the last thing on your mind ,
but you turned your bed into a vagina .
do you think my vagina has curtains ?
i don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s been .
i &apos;m tired . i &apos;m going to bed .
okay , but i still have to make the cupcakes
to bring by that place tomorrow .
i don &apos;t wanna keep you awake
so why don &apos;t you sleep in my bed tonight
and i &apos;ll pass out on your vagina ?
okay , but you better buy me breakfast in the morning .
i love this place . looks like paris in the &apos; 20s .
more like poseurs in their 20s .
man , they &apos;ve really cleaned this place up .
you &apos;ve been here before ?
yeah , it used to be a liquor store
owned by this old irish guy
who had freckles on his penis .
sometimes he &apos;d corner you and flash it ,
but then he &apos;d always comp you a free lotto ticket .
okay , well , let &apos;s try and keep that sort of charming nostalgia
out of our sales pitch .
oh , that &apos;s the owner .
i scoped it out before you got here .
and remember , i &apos;ll do the talking .
why don &apos;t i get to talk ?
freckled penis .
and besides , i have more experience .
all those who pitched business models to warren buffett as a member of
the phillips exeter entrepreneurs club raise their hands .
holla !
well , if you care enough to raise your arms about it ,
fine . you talk . i won &apos;t say anything .
hi , what can i get for you ?
hi , i &apos;m caroline and this is my business partner max .
and you are ?
semhar .
oh , jeez .
such a pretty name .
it means &quot; light of the tiger &quot; in sanskrit .
oh , jeez .
it &apos;s my yoga name .
help me , god .
well , semhar , we just opened a local neighborhood cupcake company .
our card .
we &apos;re introducing our exciting product
to local boulangeries .
please try a sample . max .
would you like coconut @-@ coffee , chocolate @-@ curry ,
or blueberry @-@ lemon zest ?
my absolute fave is the coconut @-@ coffee .
let &apos;s start with that , shall we ?
thank you , but no thank you .
well , can i ask you why ?
they &apos;re not pretty enough .
excuse me ?
they &apos;re not pretty enough .
perhaps if you tried one ,
you &apos;d see how amazing our flavor palate is .
hold off , flavour flav .
what do you mean , they &apos;re not pretty enough ?
they have a charming homemade look ,
but my customer would prefer a more upscale , prettier product .
just fyi , some upscale residents
in this very upscale building
where your upscale store actually is located
recently told us they were fabulous .
i understand .
but they &apos;re not pretty enough .
listen , battlefield earth .
this is williamsburg , brooklyn ,
and no amount of exposed brick and paint can change the fact that ,
right where you &apos;re standing ,
i &apos;ve seen tommy o &apos;hanlon &apos;s wing @-@ wang
more times than i care to remember .
and i must say , it was way less offensive than your attitude .
and you can shove that up your upscale .
let &apos;s go .

namaste .
what &apos;s with the empty hands , max ?
no cupcakes tonight ?
no , they &apos;re bugging me . i decided to take the night off .
be careful with decisions like that .
in 1987 , i took a night off from earth , wind , and fire
and the next day , they earth , wind , and fired my ass .
hi . sorry i &apos;m late .
mid @-@ afternoon nap in your vagina ?
i wish ! no .
i went to a cheap bakery supply store in greenpoint
and got us some supplies .
here .
it &apos;s the basic cake decorating kit .
and best of all i found us a fun , reasonable
two @-@ session cupcake decorating class at a bakery .
we can learn how to make pretty roses .
no way .
the cupcakes don &apos;t need to be pretty .
they compensate by having a great sense of humor .
pretty cupcakes is just another option for our business .
people want pretty , we do pretty .
or people want homemade , we do--
wait , where is our homemade ?
i didn &apos;t make any tonight .
you didn &apos;t make any ?
what , you get one piece of constructive criticism
and you stop making them ?
max , it &apos;s business .
and maybe semhar has a point about making them pretty .
first of all , what does she know about pretty ?
the woman has dreadlocks .
her head looks like the stuff
you empty out of a vacuum cleaner bag .
not pretty .
forget her .
what &apos;s happening with you ?
what &apos;s your problem with pretty ?
don &apos;t wave your divas live hand at me .
i just think society &apos;s way too concerned
with other people &apos;s idea of what &apos;s pretty .
you don &apos;t think you can do it .
that &apos;s what this is about .
this isn &apos;t about society .
you &apos;re afraid you can &apos;t do pretty .
look , i don &apos;t do pretty
the way you don &apos;t do puerto ricans .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;ll do puerto ricans .
all right .
then go do one and leave me alone .
max , it &apos;s a skill . that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s not shameful to not know how to do something .
didn &apos;t you have piano lessons growing up ?
seriously ?
ice skating ?
closest i &apos;ve come to blades on ice
was when a pregnant girl pulled a knife on me
at a hockey game .
look , you and i have a business ,
and this is a skill we need .
we &apos;re going to that class
and we are gonna master how to make pretty roses .
and i know how much you hate anything trendy ,
so i found us a family @-@ owned italian bakery in brooklyn .
italian &apos;s good .
maybe they &apos;ll know how to dump the body
after i kill you .
first of all , welcome to spice and sugar .
we did a little twist on the traditional sugar and spice
putting spice first because ...
we &apos;re italian .
and we always got the spice up front
and a little in the rear .
holla !
now are you embarrassed you ever said holla ?
my name is stephanie , and this is my cousin serena ,
and this bakery has been in our family for years
and then we took it over and made it ...
hot .
all right , let &apos;s go around and introduce ourselves
and tell us why you came tonight .
let &apos;s start with the cute guys .
always !
i &apos;m steve ,
i thought this would be a fun idea for my bachelor party .
i &apos;m getting married to michael ... right there .
so cute . god bless !
and i &apos;m michael .
i &apos;m michael as well .
michael .
oh ... so many michaels .
and you are ?
michael .
no , i &apos;m max .
oh , she &apos;s funny . so cute , god bless !
and i &apos;m caroline . i &apos;m max &apos;s partner .
oh , so many gays tonight .
i know .
no , i &apos;m her business partner .
we actually have our own cupcake business over in williamsburg ,
and i must say , we &apos;re doing very well .
max is the baker and i &apos;m the business head
and we &apos;re here tonight to increase our skill level
and take our business up to a level that &apos;s ...
hot as well .
if you &apos;re gonna talk that much ,
no one will have time to learn anything .
i know , right ?
so , uh , where &apos;s your shop ?
well , right now , we &apos;re just working out of our apartment .
so no shop .
oh , that &apos;s sweet .
cute .
yeah , good luck , god bless .
can you say jealous ?
all right , let &apos;s start simple with a pretty little icing flower .
everybody pick up your piping bags ,
and with a straight @-@ edge tip--
所以 &quot; 弯 &quot; 代表同性恋
but you guys can use your gay @-@ edge tip .
all right , everybody watch stephanie .
you &apos;re gonna take the nail head
and you &apos;re gonna make a little &quot; u &quot;
so that you get little petals .
and we &apos;ll do this five times .
and then , you have a pretty little five @-@ petal flower .
simple .
so cute . how fun !
no , no . you gotta start by making a &quot; u. &quot;
i did . that &apos;s a &quot; u. &quot;
serena , is that a &quot; u &quot; ?
not a &quot; u. &quot;
fine , i &apos;ll start over .
that was a &quot; u. &quot;
and what , just because i don &apos;t have a quote @-@ unquote shop
i don &apos;t know a &quot; u &quot; ?
what &apos;s with the attitude ?
all right , let &apos;s leave .
next time the gays giggle , we &apos;ll just slide out .
no , we &apos;re here to learn .
that looks good .
i suck . i &apos;m starting over .
max , why &apos;d you do that ? it was good .
not good enough .
you two not done yet ?
you have to master the little flower ,
or when we move on to roses you &apos;ll be screwed .
right , cuz ?
oh , totally screwed .
screwed and not in the good way .
do you think we can convince them
that slapping each other &apos;s face is the new high five ?
steve , oh , my god . that rose is gorgeous .
good for you .
all right , one more minute and we &apos;ll display our roses .
steve . little help .
i choke at timed tests .
i got like a 40 on my sats .
damn it , steve !
look at this place .
there &apos;s no way these girls
could have this much cupcake success in this economy .
i mean , the overhead on this building alone--
what are you saying ?
not saying mob money ,
just saying maybe we &apos;d have a shop too
if we had mob money .
shh .
keep it down .
you wanna wake up tomorrow with chestnut &apos;s head
in your vagina bed ?
okay , time &apos;s up . let &apos;s see what you got .
what is that ? there &apos;s like nothing there .
that &apos;s not a rose .
it &apos;s minimalist .
whatev .
no , not &quot; whatev . &quot; it &apos;s brilliant .
and i would know because , when i was in tokyo ,
i had a private japanese flower arranging class
with the head of the ikebana institute .
and he said i had a gift .
in his words ,
&quot; キャロライン とてもきれいです &quot;
whatev . okay , what about your friend there ?
i kinda ran out of time .
you had 20 minutes .
i thought she said you were the baker .
no , you need to be able to whip these out in like 20 seconds
if you wanna be successful in your little bakery .
&quot; um , i &apos;d like a cupcake . &quot; &quot; that &apos;ll be 12 hours . &quot;
right ?
right .
and they have to be prettier than that .
well , maybe you &apos;ll do better tomorrow .
remember . your homework assignment
is to bring in a cupcake with a pretty rose on it .
right . like we &apos;re gonna come back here
and spend time with these robert de nir @-@ hoes .
ugh ! that one stinks too . damn it !
max , forget it .
it &apos;s 3 : 00 a.m. go to bed .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t say anything to me .
i am so mad at you right now .
what did i do ?
everything .
i used to love making cupcakes .
it was the one thing i could zone out
and do without thinking .
and now all i &apos;m doing is thinking .
thinking that i stink at making cupcakes .
well , stop it .
who cares what they think ? they &apos;re bitchy baking bullies .
we don &apos;t have to go back there .
oh , and then what ?
i &apos;m gonna think my cupcakes weren &apos;t good enough
for the rest of my life ?
you said we need the skill , then we need the skill .
i &apos;m a lot of things , but i &apos;m not a quitter .
i &apos;m gonna make a stupid , pretty cupcake if it kills me .
or you .
and you are going back there with me .
and we &apos;re gonna shove our pretty cupcake
有意大利血统 行为大胆荒唐
right up snooki and her cousin &apos;s asses .
now , shut up , don &apos;t talk to me ,
and go back in your vagina .
sorry you had to see that , chestnut .
oh , not very pretty .
but at least you tried , michael .
just one question .
are you sure that you &apos;re gay ?
oh , okay , caroline . let &apos;s see your pretty rose .
i didn &apos;t do one . society is way too concerned
with other people &apos;s idea of what &apos;s pretty .
whatevs .
okay , what about your baker there ?
she bail too ?
no , here it is .
max , that &apos;s so pretty .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
good work , god bless . good for you .
how long did it take you ?
about three hours and 40 minutes .
but i did it !
i just wanted to prove to you and myself
i can make something pretty .
and now that i have--
that cupcake wasn &apos;t me . i don &apos;t do pretty .
but i did make each of you a cupcake that i think says
what i feel about this whole cupcake class .
this one says &quot; bite me . &quot;
this one says &quot; screw u. &quot;
you see that &quot; u &quot; ? that &apos;s a &quot; u. &quot;
holla !
well , good luck with that .
people don &apos;t want cupcakes that insult them .
oh , my god , max . that &apos;s our thing .
i was wrong . you were right .
we don &apos;t need to make pretty cupcakes .
everybody does pretty .
we have to do what you do best .
insult people .
yeah , who &apos;s gonna buy that ?
we will . for our shower .
and really let us bitches have it !
