Bust-Out
You have to be 110% sure this is who you saw.
This is definitely him.
Had you ever seen him before?
No.
And the other man?
I didn't get a good look at him.
The light reflected off the car. But he was heavyset.
It was really dark. I didn't want to be seen.
I heard shots but I thought they were firecrackers.
When the two men drove out, I hid in the ragweed.
Sure.
What happened began to dawn on me.
But like I told the officers...
...I left the flat tire and walked to a phone.
Thank you, Mr. Arthur.
I'm so goddamn fed up with crime.
I had to come forward to help you find them.
Thanks to people like you, we may just do that.
May I ask who the dead man was?
Just a poor kid in the wrong crowd.
Crack?
Something like that.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy! Mommy! No!
Mommy!
Hey...
What's the matter, you lost?
Uh-huh.
You scared me half to death! I can't turn my back for a minute!
I know what that's like. My little guy was a real cadet at his age.
Tony!
It's good you could meet me.
No problem. I went to Brookstone and got a scale.
What's it about?
Fucking Dick Barone.
As long as the two of you are happy.
I'm in no mood.
This garbage business. I found out that bow-tied motherfucker...
...is charging me double to tip my trucks at his place.
So pay the tonnage, and charge your townships extra for the pickups.
I got the smallest amount of routes of anybody in the association.
You're like the old woman with ham under her arm, crying for bread.
What the fuck?
Never mind. The point is...
...your brother, Jack, never concentrated on sanitation...
...so what do you want Dick to do?
I want a rate.
I'll see what he says.
Yeah. You see. Since you own part of the company.
Did you shut all the lights?
Yeah.
In the kitchen?
Yeah.
I want to spend more time with AJ.
It's the other one who's almost out of the house.
I'm not worried about Meadow. Meadow can take care of herself.
Why the sudden burst of fatherhood?
Can you say anything without sarcasm?
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's a good idea. He adores you. He never spends enough time with you.
Yeah, well...
I was reading in Time, this study at Harvard.
"A father's support is absolutely linked...
...to a boy's later capacity to manage frustrations...
...to explore new circumstances...
...and do well."
Kid needs to toughen up.
No, I'm talking about opening up.
He needs some street smarts.
Not to be a sucker, or get involved with the wrong people.
I don't want another Christopher on my hands. Look at him.
He's lucky to be alive.
That other poor prick they found dead.
Kid was 23 or something.
Hey, pal, with the Raml a...
...put three cases of that in my car.
You got it.
That's not a mistake.
I want another 14 gross of model number 4784.
Plastic picnic coolers. Ship them, I'll worry about selling them.
Red. Fuck blue, red sells.
Put it here.
Put that on the store tab.
He says take three gross of the blue, he'll give us a price on the red.
Fuck that. He's never getting paid anyway.
They gotta be all red. Just do it, please.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Who gets chicken and peppers?
A lot of work to move picnic coolers.
Coolers are like scissors...
...everybody wants one, nobody has any idea how much they cost.
You put a Nigerian on the street, have him sell these...
...for a couple bucks apiece, who's not gonna say, "Fuck it, give me one"?
How we doing with them airline tickets?
Won't it raise a flag with the travel agency?
A sports store charges tickets in bulk?
Say it's for promotion. Customer of the Year, Salesman of the Month...
...that kind of thing.
Don't worry. You put it on different credit lines.
Suddenly I'm ordering all this shit.
I mean, picnic coolers, Raml a water...
When do they realize I'm not paying and call the cops?
When your fucking credit runs out, Diamond Jim.
Until then, get on the horn and order.
Unless you can pay us the principal you owe.
Hey!
Put the heat up.
Today!
Oh, fuck! Fuck!
What's the matter?
Spider.
So kill it.
You do it.
Come here and kill the thing.
Come here.
No way.
Come on.
It was a leaf, you frigging idiot!
Mister!
Yeah.
There's a man here to see you.
Who?
A police.
Be right back.
Did you let them in the house?
Warrant, warrant. How do you say it in fucking Polish?
Agent Harris! Who's your friend?
I'm Detective Harold Giardina. From the Essex County Task Force.
Pleased to meet you. But if you don't have a warrant, get out.
I'm busy.
I can see that.
A comedian. Is that how you broke your nose?
We could've phoned. We paid the courtesy of a visit.
Let's talk at the station.
Talk?
About Matthew Bevilaqua.
Dad?
Take the backboard out. I'll be down in a second.
Lawyer up, whatever, it's your call. Just name the time.
On your way out, can you roll the garbage down? Tomorrow's pickup day.
Let's go, Harry.
Those are the FBI guys from before. What did they want?
Nothing.
Keep this between us. You know how your mother gets.
What do you got for me?
A partial list of the major investors in Webistics.
I haven't seen Tony in a while.
Besides the night he capped Bevilaqua?
What do you mean?
Did you fuck me?!
Did you fuck me?!
Take it easy.
How about I put a bullet in your stupid boar's head?
He was spotted, Sal. So don't go pulling my taffy.
As of this second, if you lie to me...
...you will never see the streets for 50 fucking years!
Did you know about this?
No.
If you knew Soprano was planning something...
...and didn't wear a wire...
I told you no!
There was someone else there that night.
A quote, unquote: "Husky accomplice."
Yeah?
Yeah.
But the witness couldn't I.D. him.
Oh.
Were you the perp he couldn't I.D.?
What, are you fucking crazy?
What did I tell you, huh? No fucking violence!
I ought to burn you and let the judge throw away the key!
I'm deciding to believe you. But here's what you're gonna do.
I want Tony's voice on tape, saying, "I killed Matthew Bevilaqua."
No distortion. No throat clearings. No nose-blowing.
I get it. But let me ask you something.
If I did ride with Tony on something like that...
...wouldn't that get me tighter with him, raise my coinage?
Make Tony forget all his suspicions?
You're a cute prick, Puss.
Get me Tony on tape talking about this murder.
Who's the witness?
No joke, Sal. You don't want to see my darker side.
Go.
lf they had enough to pinch you...
...there'd be bars between us as we speak.
Why do they want me to go there?
Lock you into a story.
So later at trial, any contradiction will sink you.
We going?
Did you say you'd go?
Please.
All right, procrastinate.
Let me get our ducks in a row. Keep your cool and go the speed limit.
Don't give them an in.
What'd I just say?
Don't give them an in.
Are you all right, Tony?
This is some bad shit here.
What's up, Anthony? How did this happen?
Midlife crisis? You can talk to me.
The mothers last year said we should end senior night at Long Beach Island.
They'll dance, scavenger hunt and the liquor stores will be closed.
And we count noses.
Okay.
Is that the time? I'm gonna barely get Natalie to tap.
Chris, need a ride?
No, my brother's coming.
Eric took my car to a meet.
Next week, my house.
We'll tie up the loose ends.
Christine, I'm so glad you stayed.
I kind of wanted to.
When I found out about Eric's car, I told Tony to give it back...
I wish I could say this is a first for David, but...
Eric is going to college, and maybe it's better for his grades.
So April 1, huh? How I dread it.
So long as Eric gets into Georgetown.
It's his first choice.
Meadow wants to go to Berkeley.
Hi. We just finished.
Sorry I'm late. I was bidding a job.
My brother, the wallpaper artist. The one you can trust...
...with your Brunswick & Fields. Vic, Carmela Soprano. Victor Musto.
Nice to meet you.
You too.
You have a beautiful house.
Thank you.
Could use a little freshening up.
Vic does amazing border work too.
I was thinking of wallpapering the dining room. Do you have a card?
Yeah, sure.
I'm bonded and state certified, but I'm still dangerous.
Well, bye, Carmela. Thanks.
Let's get together and have lunch.
Have you tried the new Vesuvio?
No.
Okay, lunch. Promise.
Yes.
Nice meeting you.
I'll call about the wallpaper.
Nice lady.
Don't even think about it. She's married to Tony Soprano.
Married's good enough. The husband doesn't matter, I respect the ring.
Especially that ring. Probably came off a dead finger.
David? Are you down there?
Be right up!
What are you doing?
Fixing the fucking light bulb!
It glares off the ball when I rack!
Jesus, okay.
You're always worried about ruining the felt.
Richie, baby, you're the best one!
Oh, baby. Oh, you're the best one ever.
Oh, baby, you're the best! Oh, baby, you're the best.
Oh, Richie. Oh, Richie. Oh, you're the boss.
Oh, you're the boss! Oh, you're the boss!
Oh, baby! Oh, you're the best!
It should be you. Oh, it should be you.
What?
Where'd that come from?
What?
"It should be you"? What are you trying to say, Janice?
What?
Don't "what" me!
Why'd you say that?
I was making love to you, baby.
You know what you said.
I was in the heat of passion. I'm doing it like you like.
"Boss" this, "boss" that...
"It should be you."
That's not part of it.
How can you think of that during sex? You're not in the moment.
I find powerful men erotic.
Was that another dig in me?
Oh, Jesus, Richie.
I gotta be loyal.
Without that, we crumble.
Tell that to Paul Castallano.
I'm old school, Janice.
All I mean is, my brother needs help.
Teaching him manners is one thing.
My Uncle Junior still has friends...
...and he thinks the world of you.
"When your opponent gives you an opening...
...be swift as a hare. " Sun Tzu.
When I think of that jacket I gave your brother...
...and he spit on it...
...I could slice an ear off his head.
Richie, wait.
Ma, if you need something, call. I'll bring it up.
Are you smoking marijuana? I want to watch the TV.
We should get one for your room.
Listen to her.
Like Rose Kennedy, with all her money to throw around.
It's giving me agita. Want me to go downtown.
Lock you into a story.
Why the fuck ain't they talking to you?
Give them time. They will.
Murder in aid of racketeering.
Twenty to life.
There they are. The Flying Cafone Brothers.
Not good. Not good.
On my kids, I will fucking cut you! Just tell me!
Take it easy, Ton. It's fixable.
First off, it's not a rat.
Thank God.
Don't thank Him yet. There's an eyeball witness.
What are you talking about?
Jesus Christ! Shit!
Did you see anybody, any living soul?
Fuck, no!
Don't worry. A bump in the road.
Oh, you're beautiful.
Who? Do we know him?
All we know is that he's a civilian.
A flag-saluting motherfucker.
Maybe you should lamb chop it for a while.
I keep a suitcase in my trunk.
Tell us about it.
Fuck all youse. Bygones are never bygones.
This is a nightmare. I'm gonna have to move some cash.
If I go, I'm going with a package. Not like Massucco.
He had five minutes to run...
...and ended up in a rat motel down in Elvis country.
What is that?
Where there are no Jews or Italians.
I don't get it.
It's starting!
It's starting!
Get back in your office, David!
I open my mail and it's a lawsuit! It's a fucking lien on the building!
Not fucking now, okay?
They're gonna know it's fraud!
I'm gonna go to jail for this!
Get the fuck back in your hole!
Now!
Davey...
You're doing a good job.
Don't worry about this witness.
Exactly.
Exactly.
You don't know what he said.
I did too.
What, then?
I understood.
What's it mean?
It means, "Sit on this, cocksucker!"
Five minutes away from life in prison and I'm fucking laughing.
You gotta, skip, you gotta.
Davey never takes me to dinner.
Yeah, when you're dating it's all candles and wine and...
Dave's been even more preoccupied than usual lately.
Well, he's busy.
Carmela, my husband has a disease.
A serious gambling problem.
I am so sorry.
Thank God the store's in my name.
He can't sell it without me, or he would have gambled it all away.
But I'm gonna make sure we get through this.
Give me those.
I'm gonna make you two beautiful women a special-tasting menu.
I was hoping he'd say that.
I know you ordered the Pellegrino, but I want you to try this.
I got such a deal on this Raml a.
It was nice to meet your brother. He seems very interesting.
He's a doll. When his wife was dying, he waited on her hand and foot.
A widower? So young.
Breast cancer.
I thought there was a sadness about him.
And the children?
Childless. She had a hostile womb.
I had a dream about him.
You did?
Christine.
He asked me about you too.
He was wallpapering my dining room.
It was your subconscious telling you you want him to wallpaper the room.
Hey, cucuzza!
I got something for you.
What?
A Fenwick Rod and a Penn International Reel.
Thanks.
Wanted it for Christmas, remember?
But it was back-ordered? Well, I got a great deal on it.
We'll take the boat and go fishing.
Okay.
What are you doing now?
You want to go fishing now?
No, I figured we'd see a movie or something...
...get some pizza.
I can't.
What do you mean?
I'm going to the mall.
You gotta go to the mall?
Not just me.
Brad, Allen, Heidi, her sister maybe.
Like a double date.
No, Dad. We're just going to the mall. We go there sometimes.
And do what?
Get something to eat. Mrs. Fields.
Anyway, I gotta go. I'm meeting them there.
All right. Go ahead.
See you later.
Yeah, my girl did the same thing...
...at his age. Boys and girls, always in a group.
What's that about?
What's it about for you?
In my day, a boy and girl went on a date.
Your father hoped you wouldn't get too far or you'd knock her up...
...and her parents would break your legs.
I don't think it's about him going to the mall with a group...
...that bothered you.
Wasn't it that he went to the mall instead of going with you?
He's starting to get his own life.
One that doesn't include you.
It was always, "We'll do this." "We're gonna do that."
I've heard you talk many times about being with your son.
Well, that's over now. Gone. Done.
It's bittersweet, this period.
You're glad that they're growing up, but you're sad to lose them.
I could be going away.
For a very long time.
For something I didn't do.
How about, "That's too bad"? Or, "What a shame, Tony"?
We can't go into specifics on this.
Here's something specific.
I didn't do anything wrong. We can't talk about it?
I could be going to the can for the rest of my life...
...and I'm not supposed to discuss it with my psychiatrist?
What the fuck are you for anyway?
How does that feel?
The idea that you might be sent to prison?
I gotta stay around a little while longer for the kids.
Especially my boy.
Once he's out of the house, the government can do what they want.
Give me life, the chair, whatever.
I've never seen you like this.
Like what?
Scared.
I wouldn't use that word.
But sometimes I feel... I don't know, I don't know.
You motherfuckers! You motherfuckers!
I don't fucking deserve this!
How's your medication?
Maybe we should stop.
What?
Don't have the witness yet.
Nothing?
This is the FBI, Ton.
Local cops, buy them a Christmas tree, they'll give up their grandmother.
You know how tight these feds can keep it.
Go home, get some sleep.
You don't want to stop by the Bing, get something to eat?
Tell me, T, what do you want me to do?
Just let me think. Come on.
All right.
Tony! What are you doing here?
Could ask you the same question.
It's my store.
Congratulations, it's a fucking disaster.
The airline tickets came in. You want me to split them with you guys?
They're mine. It was my idea.
This is where you sleep?
Yeah, sometimes.
It's easier than going home.
I know what you mean.
I remember when you transferred into 10th grade from...
...Baden-Baden.
Fucking Army brat.
Remember when those Paterson Guidos caught you up at Garret Mountain...
...and you were in your dad's car...
...and I threw a rock at that guy?
Don't reminisce on me.
You told me not to get in the game.
Why'd you let me do it?
I knew you had this business, Davey.
It's my nature. Frog and the scorpion, you know?
Besides, if you would've won, I'd be crying the blues.
Right?
What's the end?
The end? It's planned bankruptcy.
You're not the first guy to get busted out.
This is how I make a living. It's my bread and butter.
When this is over, you're free to go.
Oh, for chrissake.
Anthony!
Dig!
Anthony! Anthony, dig!
Come on!
Anthony!
Oh, my God, that was so exciting!
I banged my foot. I would've came in second.
You were like a fish out there.
Where's Dad?
He couldn't make it.
He had a meeting. He'll be here next time.
This is the last meet of the season.
Next year, I mean.
Okay.
Got a safe?
Yeah, why?
You want to pay in advance?
There's over 400 K there.
I want you to hold it for me. This goes down, I'm out of the area.
My wife will come for a weekly allowance.
You don't ask her any questions and you never, ever refuse her.
If she wants it all...
...you give it to her.
She won't do that. She's smarter than that.
And if the money doesn't last?
Don't worry, you won't go into your own kick.
This witness can't remain nameless forever.
I didn't hear that!
Don't you got school tomorrow?
So?
So it's late. Go to bed.
Did you hear me?
I hope you apologized to him.
For what?
You promised to be at his swim meet.
Oh, shit, I forgot.
How could you forget?
There was something I had to do.
He almost came in second. You should've seen his face.
I saw his face when he went to the mall...
...and I wanted to go to the movies.
Are you 6 years old?
I said I'd try to be there.
What is with you, Tony?
This whole week...
...you're like an alien life form.
There's nothing wrong.
Thank you for sharing.
Know what, leave me the fuck alone. I'll make up for the swim meet.
Where were you? Did you see Chris at the hospital?
Yeah, I went to see Christopher at the hospital.
Wherever you were, it's more important to let your son know you care!
No, only you care. Fuck you.
No, fuck you!
Fuck you! You fucking...!
What's wrong with you?
Hey.
My God, you scared the shit out of me.
No. Shut them off.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I don't know.
I like the dark.
Sit.
I gotta go online.
Oh, come on. Sit for a minute. Come on.
What's going on?
With what?
Whatever, I don't know. What's going on?
I just told you. The chat room.
Is that it?
You know I love you, right, Med?
Dad...
No, don't "Dad" me, come on.
I want to know.
Do you know that I love you?
Yes.
I know that you love me.
Your mother doesn't think I love you enough.
And you listen to her?
Everything I do...
...and everything I've done, and everything I will do...
...it's all for you and your brother.
I think you should go to bed.
I tell people...
...you're like your mother, but...
...you're all me. Nothing gets by you.
I know you think I'm a hypocrite...
I'm going to bed.
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
Dad?
Why don't you go to bed?
No, I'm gonna finish my drink.
Good night.
Good night, baby.
Sometimes...
...we're all hypocrites.
Good night, baby.
Good night.
How are you guys doing? Ready for another sandwich?
You ought to go into business.
Oh, stop it.
Thank you, no, Mrs. Carmela.
I thought you might want this. You said Ramone backed over yours.
I lied.
I smelled those sausages and I wanted you to make me lunch.
Guess I'm hungry for a home-cooked meal.
My wife was a gourmet cook.
Christine told me about her. I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
We were talking about the powder room?
Do you have a minute to look at it?
Oh, yeah, sure.
The paper here now...
...I think it kind of closes the room in.
I see what you mean. It's the vertical striping.
Somebody even talked me into papering the back of the door here.
I must have been out of my mind.
It's a lot for the eye to handle in such a confined space.
So, what do you think? Should I just paint or do something plain-ish?
Just grass cloth, maybe, or...
Oh, Jesus.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I never did anything like this before.
I couldn't help it.
I never felt like this before.
It won't happen again.
Of course not.
I apologize.
Okay.
You should, maybe, get back to work.
Yeah.
What about little Eric?
He has been ripped from the arms of the only mother he has ever known.
You know how that boy loves you.
We cannot let her do this.
Hey, Uncle Junior.
I thought you guys might like some salami and eggs.
Always thinking.
My mother says to send her love.
Put that stuff in the bedroom. Leave the sneakers.
You want to try them on?
I don't wear that shit.
They're for the black kid who washes my car.
Poor prick wears a pair that's wrapped with duct tape.
You're too good, Junior. That's your problem.
Did she say she was knocked up?
Who?
Fuck, I turn my head one second and they slip one in on you.
She's a puttana, this one. Fucked an arson investigator last week.
Thank my nephew for the stuff.
Your nephew?
This shit comes from my end. Wait a minute. I take it back.
The sneakers are from Tony.
Cock.
You know, Uncle Jun, it kills me to sit back and watch...
Forget it.
Finish what you were gonna say.
I forgot already.
Then un-forget.
I notice that he's fucking you.
This bust-out is a license to steal. What's he throwing your way?
This garbage thing? He's already taking your townships.
Now he's fucking with mine?
What should I do?
I'm under indictment.
I don't want to open old wounds...
You're in no shape for disharmony.
You and I both know he's gotta go.
That's my nephew. How dare you, in my home.
This fucking guy was supposed to be laid out on Midland Avenue a year ago.
I know it and you know it.
Let me tell you who's not a good kid.
My niece. I left my brother's house one night...
...and my wallet was light. I'm talking a 10-year-old girl, Richie.
Word to the wise, that's all I'm saying.
Now you can make homemade sausage and homemade pasta...
Hi, Grandma.
Your aunt forgot to lock that door.
I told her, I don't trust that new mailman.
Guess what? I got my answers from colleges today.
Oh, yeah? How'd you do?
Accepted at Berkeley, accepted at NYU...
...wait list, Columbia, Penn I didn't make it...
...Bowdoin I didn't make it, BU accepted.
What about that other place, Georgetown?
Wait list.
You don't owe them anything.
Thanks, Grandma.
Lock that door, will you?
and for dessert, the kids can make their own chocolate pasta.
Hello?
Carmela, Vic Musto.
Hi, how are you?
I'm good. I'm fine. I...
I was just thinking about you and what happened this morning.
I just wanted to say again...
No, please, it was a crazy thing.
But if it's a problem, I've got another job in Wyckoff.
Yours is far enough along that Ramone can finish up.
There's no charge...
...except for materials.
No, I wouldn't think of it.
It's just that...
...since Jill, there hasn't been anyone to talk to.
Oh, I know.
In fact...
What?
Maybe you could send Ramone to the other job tomorrow.
That way you and I would have a chance to talk, on your lunch break.
That would be so great.
And I could make a lunch for us.
Maybe a galantine de poulet...
...mesclun salad, nice bottle of Barolo.
That sounds incredible. - Okay.
Okay, then, thanks for calling. That's terrific.
See you tomorrow.
I will talk to you tomorrow, bye.
Who was that?
It was nobody, the wallpaper man.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Please, no.
What the hell is it?
"The victim has been identified as Matthew Bevilaqua...
...a Soprano family associate."
Fuck, give me that.
"Officials are keeping tight-lipped...
...as it may involve a high-ranking Mafia member."
Where's that number?
Fridge.
Those lying cocksuckers!
Where is it?
On the fridge!
Where on the fucking fridge?
I knew it!
But you had to be the big man!
Jesus Christ, David. Where the hell have you been?
Thanks for coming. Thanks for coming.
I'm glad you called. My sister's been worried sick.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I should've called her.
Why don't I say "sorry" to the whole fucking world with a blimp.
Christine knows you're gambling again.
I'm not gambling anymore. I'm broke.
Jesus Christ!
I screwed up, Vic.
I screwed up really bad this time.
It's gonna be all right.
You'll go to Gamblers Anonymous and we'll get you on your feet.
Gamblers Anonymous.
No joke, you're going back there.
Is that right? Where were you when I dropped out in the first place?
I was twisting in the wind out there.
What?
You and your broom-up-her-ass sister, you didn't give a fuck!
You looked the other way!
It's our fault?
Don't ever talk about her like that.
Oh, fuck her! Fuck you!
How much did you lose? How much?
How much did you lose?
Everything.
What do you mean?
Everything. For chrissake, Vic, everything.
The savings, the business, everything!
You disgust me.
I have to go Chapter 11...
...then the liquidators will come in.
This is it, David.
You have fucking had it. This is it.
As soon as Eric goes to college...
He got into Georgetown today...
When he's out, you're packing up...
...and you're keeping the fuck away from my sister!
Don't tell me you blew his college fund.
Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ!
You fucking asshole! How could you do that?
Jesus!
I'm paying for Eric's education.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're a great man, Vic.
Wait a minute.
How could you lose the business? It's in my sister's name.
I didn't gamble it away, exactly.
What happened?
I got involved with some bad people, and I got in debt to them.
Fucking Tony Soprano, all right?
Yeah. Tony-fucking-Soprano.
It's a bust-out. When you can't pay them...
...they become your partners and eat through everything, like termites!
What about the cops?
They're animals, Vic!
They started a fire in my dumpster and then...
...these two guys came to see me one night.
You got no idea what "dead eyes" means until you face them...
...in your fucking bathrobe and your flip-flops.
France, 1944.
General George Patton leads his Third Army into battle.
He knows that the controversies around him have tarnished his reputation.
He desperately wants to vindicate himself in the only way he knows how:
In battle.
Hello?
It's over, skip.
What?
You know that other party...
...who said he saw something that we know didn 't happen?
Yeah.
He realizes now he didn't see...
...what didn't happen.
Yeah.
Sleep well, my friend.
major strategy is the attack.
"The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed, " he said.
His hatred for the enemy...
...is matched only by his fierce concern for his men.
You seem relieved.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So this person, the witness...
...simply changed his or her mind?
I don't know what happened.
You don't?
What's that supposed to mean?
You know, when I was in Italy...
...I met somebody like you.
A woman. And it's not what you think.
Like me in what way?
Smart.
Know what she said to me?
What did she say?
That I'm my own worst enemy.
Kind of a clich? isn't it?
You had to be there. She's one of them...
...witchy broads, you know?
Not like a psychic, but...
I didn't mean to sound disparaging.
Well, it's an ancient culture over there.
They believe all this weird shit.
Like sibyls.
Sibyls?
Like I said, you had to be there.
Okay, so I wanted to fuck her. But she was right, wasn't she?
I mean, I bring all this on myself.
That's what you tell me.
Yes, I suppose it is. At root.
The question is, how do you stop?
You know what?
I dodged a very big bullet. And I'm feeling pretty fucking good about it.
So I don't need anymore psychiatry today.
License and registration, pal.
Hey, Tony, what are you doing here?
I got something for you.
What is that?
Fifty grand.
Get the fuck out of here with that.
Why, because I'm a paraplegic?
My idea was for you to donate it...
...to the spinal injury foundation.
I'm gonna walk again, Tony.
I know you are, Beans.
In the meantime, you donate, get your picture up, you inspire people.
You mean, be like a fucking poster boy? Is that what you mean?
Take the money. You can whack it up with the foundation.
Fuck you, Tony.
Take the money, Beans.
You gotta take it.
Beansie.
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you, Beans.
Lilliana, can you get that?
Ramone!
Good morning, missus.
Mr. Musto no is come.
Is he okay?
He has to go to the other job.
Oh, okay.
Want to steer?
Yeah.
No, you don't.
I do.
I'd let you, but if the harbor master sees, we'll get in trouble.
Nobody's gonna see.
I don't know.
Come on.
Go ahead.
A boat's not like a car. You've got no breaks and can't make quick turns.
So you've gotta anticipate your turns a lot sooner.
This is so cool.
Six hundred and twenty horsepower.
