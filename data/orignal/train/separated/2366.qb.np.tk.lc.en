you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
the sun and the moon curse ?
the curse placed on klaus .
what does that make klaus--
a werewolf or a vampire ?
he &apos;s both .
when i was little ,
your mom used to tell me stories about vampires .
i never thought that what she said could be true .
what is klaus &apos; curse ?
witches , serpents of nature ,
saw to it that my brother &apos;s werewolf side would become dormant .
he wants to trigger that part of him that &apos;s a werewolf .
klaus can &apos;t be killed ?
curse must be broken when klaus is in transition .
that &apos;s when he &apos;ll be at his most vulnerable .
bonnie will be able to kill klaus without hurting herself .
and elijah knows how to save my life .
you can all go to hell .
tonight is the full moon .
we should assume that klaus is prepared to break the curse .
elena said that the sun and the moon curse is fake ?
that it &apos;s actually just a curse placed on klaus .
klaus is a vampire borne of a werewolf bloodline .
the curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting .
but if he breaks it ...
he &apos;ll be a true hybrid .
then why are we letting him break the curse ?
we can kill him today .
with bonnie .
damon ...
no . bonnie can &apos;t use that much power without dying .
i &apos;ll write her a great eulogy .
it &apos;s not an option , damon .
all right , how do we break this curse ?
well , the ritual itself is relatively straightforward .
the ingredients , so to speak , you already know .
the moon stone .
a witch will channel the power of the full moon
to release the spell that &apos;s bound within the stone .
after that , klaus , being both werewolf and vampire ,
will sacrifice one of each .
and where do i fit into it ?
the final part of the ritual .
klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger ...
to the point of your death .
and that &apos;s where you come in .
this is an elixir that i acquired
some 500 years ago for katerina .
it possesses mystical properties
of resuscitation .
so i &apos;ll be dead ?
and then you won &apos;t .
that &apos;s your plan ?
a magical witch potion with no expiration date ?
you want to come back to life , what about john &apos;s ring ?
those rings only work on humans .
the doppelganger &apos;s a supernatural occurrence .
odds are , the ring won &apos;t work .
i &apos;ll take those odds over your elixir .
what if it doesn &apos;t work , elena ?
then i guess i &apos;ll just be dead .
do we know if klaus has everything he needs to do this ?
does he have a werewolf ?
klaus has been waiting to
break this curse for over a thousand years .
if he doesn &apos;t already have a werewolf ,
my guess is by tonight , he will .
tyler , honey .
it &apos;s your mother .
i don &apos;t know where you are , but i need you .
i &apos;ve had an accident and i &apos;m in the hospital .
please , tyler ,
come home .
why did i say that ?
because you had a terrible fall .
breakfast of champions , huh ?
i &apos;m surrounded by idiots .
i need all the help i can get .
you know , you &apos;re not helping .
elijah is an original vampire , stefan .
one we tried to kill .
you &apos;re going to believe this guy ?
what do you want me to do , damon ?
elena made her decision .
she &apos;s choosing to trust elijah .
i &apos;m going to put my faith in her .
why ? she &apos;s going to end up dead .
because she put her faith in me .
she chose to trust me in spite of what i am .
i &apos;m going to bet on somebody &apos;s instincts ,
it &apos;s going to be hers .
well , then , that makes you the biggest idiot of them all .
she chose to trust you , too .
then maybe you shouldn &apos;t be so sure about her instincts .
he can &apos;t understand why i &apos;m willing to do this .
why are you ?
i &apos;m the key to breaking the curse .
klaus is here because of me .
if i don &apos;t stop him , then he &apos;s going to hurt people .
it &apos;s that simple .
you know , there &apos;s a possibility this elixir won &apos;t work .
i don &apos;t want to mislead you .
i know the chance i &apos;m taking .
no ...
jenna ? jenna !
get out !
jenna , put the cross @-@ bow down , ok ? it &apos;s me .
stay away from me .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s me , elena , i swear , ok ?
he let me go . klaus let me go .
prove it .
ok , uh , first night you and i spent together ,
jeremy walked in right when i was ...
ok . it &apos;s him .
why did he let you go ?
he wanted me to deliver a message .
the sacrifice happens tonight .
tyler ?
mom .
you &apos;re back .
i &apos;m back .
jeez !
sorry !
i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
it &apos;s ok , i just , i didn &apos;t know you were here .
yeah , i wanted to try and
catch you on your break so we could hang out .
i have lunch in an hour .
perfect .
i will go run some errands and i will be right back .
i &apos;ll see you in a bit .
ok .
does she suspect anything ?
no , but ...
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
i &apos;ve been with her the past few days ,
and i &apos;m putting on the best show of my life .
but either she is too ,
or she &apos;s still the same caroline .
she &apos;s not the same . she &apos;s a vampire .
at this point , i don &apos;t even know what that means .
look , i know this is hard to understand ,
but my family , we were raised with this .
they &apos;re monsters , matt .
they have no soul , no humanity .
there &apos;s nothing about her that makes me believe that .
it &apos;s an act .
i believed damon salvatore was my closest ally
in this town . instead , he &apos;s a killer .
they killed your sister .
what other proof do you need ?
i could ask you the same question , sheriff .
why haven &apos;t you done anything ? why are you hesitating ?
because i need more information .
and because , in spite of everything i just said ,
i still look at her and i--
i see my daughter .
damon is the problem , not caroline .
you should focus on him .
i shouldn &apos;t have involved you , matt .
thank you for all of your help ,
but i &apos;ll take it from here .
so you don &apos;t remember anything that happened ?
no . it &apos;s like i blacked out and woke up 3 days later .
katherine was there . she &apos;s under compulsion .
damon snuck her some vervain ,
but she can &apos;t leave until klaus tells her she can .
where is damon ?
i saw him go upstairs .
so what else did i do ?
you disappeared .
i don &apos;t want to hear anymore .
i need you to understand why i &apos;m doing this .
why ? it clearly doesn &apos;t matter what i think .
i &apos;ll be fine , damon .
i &apos;ll drink the elixir , bonnie will kill klaus ,
and then all of this will finally be over .
if it works .
it will work .
you think it will work . you want it to work .
why am i the only one who &apos;s convinced it won &apos;t ?
there has to be another way .
there isn &apos;t .
and you &apos;re going to die , elena .
and then i &apos;ll come back to life .
that is not a risk i &apos;m willing to take .
but i am .
it &apos;s my life , damon .
my choice .
i can &apos;t lose you .
you won &apos;t .
there is another way .
what are you ...
damon , no !
damon , no !
what did you do ? !
huh ? what did you do ? !
i saved her life .
you &apos;re so bent on dying ,
at least this way i know you &apos;ll come back .
as a vampire !
she &apos;ll come back a vampire .
it &apos;s better than nothing else .
how could you , of all people , take that choice away from her ?
go ahead , wish me an eternity of misery .
believe me , you &apos;ll get over it .
stefan !
admit it .
you just wish you had the balls to do it yourself .
damon , no !
get out of here !
what the hell &apos;s going on ?
just get him out of here !
oh , my god .
ok , jenna , downstairs are some blood bags .
go get them now . go !
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re going to be ok .
i &apos;m so sorry .
shh . it &apos;s ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
well , it sounds like you won &apos;t be needing this anymore .
feeding her vampire blood rendered it useless .
tell elena i &apos;ll be back before nightfall .
we &apos;ll proceed as planned .
we both know that elixir wouldn &apos;t have worked anyway .
the problem , damon ,
you talk a good game but you don &apos;t actually know anything .
she &apos;ll never forgive you .
and never for a vampire ...
it &apos;s a very long time .
thank you .
both of you .
yeah , well , we &apos;ll be downstairs .
i know it &apos;s , a lot to take in .
yeah .
i tried to protect you from all this ,
but i should have known you could handle it .
can i ?
well , you just did .
look , jenna ...
i know we have a lot to talk about .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re ok .
i should have said that already .
how could he do that to me ? why ?
we &apos;ve never talked about this .
what this all means .
it doesn &apos;t matter .
of course it matters .
it matters .
i want you to go somewhere with me .
stefan , i can &apos;t .
no , no , it &apos;s not far , ok ?
it &apos;s just for the day .
i promise .
what are you doing here ?
i should be asking you that .
i told you not to come .
she &apos;s my mother . i had to .
now we have to get out of here ;
lock ourselves up before tonight .
tyler ?
jules .
i &apos;ll give you a few minutes .
thank you .
just a few , tyler .
i got it .
she &apos;s just making sure i &apos;m safe .
so what , are you two , like , friends now ?
she &apos;s been helping me .
how are you ?
i heard about your mom .
i just came to check in on her .
she &apos;s banged up , but she &apos;ll be ok .
and you ?
how &apos;s everything with you ?
i &apos;m hanging in there .
good .
i should get going .
jules and i need to get on the road .
you &apos;re leaving again ?
i left for a reason , caroline .
your explanation must have got lost in the mail ,
along with your good @-@ bye .
take care of yourself .
tyler--
let &apos;s go .
hey , caroline , it &apos;s me .
i thought you were coming back to meet me .
look , i need to talk to you . it &apos;s important .
thanks .
i &apos;ll have the same .
i screwed up .
yeah . yeah , you did .
gentlemen ?
why so glum ?
klaus , i presume .
in the flesh .
thanks for the loaner , mate .
any reason you stopped by to say hi ?
i &apos;m told you and your brother fancy my doppelganger .
just thought i &apos;d remind you to not do anything you &apos;ll regret .
thanks for your advice .
i don &apos;t suppose i could talk you into a postponement , by any chance , huh ?
you are kidding .
he is kidding , right ?
no , not really .
i mean , come on , what &apos;s one month
in the whole grand scheme of things ?
let me be clear--
i have my vampire .
i have my werewolf .
i have everything i need .
the ritual will happen tonight .
so if you want to live to see tomorrow ,
don &apos;t screw it up .
that was fun .
you &apos;re getting screwed up , aren &apos;t you ?
you think if i took his werewolf out of the equation ,
she might ... get over the fact
that i tried to turn her into a vampire ?
i think it won &apos;t matter , because you &apos;ll be dead .
but without the werewolf ,
he can &apos;t perform the ritual tonight ,
which means i would have bought her one month
before the next full moon .
but you &apos;ll still be dead .
are you gonna help me or what ?
what do you want me to do ?
where are we ?
it &apos;s a surprise .
just a little bit longer .
i &apos;m not a vampire yet , you know .
my legs still get tired .
ready to talk about how you &apos;re feeling about all this ?
this morning i was wondering
if i would live or die , and now ...
i &apos;m going to be a vampire . i--
i don &apos;t really know how i &apos;m feeling .
my god , this is beautiful .
i think you do know how you feel .
i just want you to know that it &apos;s ok to tell me .
i can &apos;t .
stefan , i just ...
i can &apos;t talk about it .
well , if you don &apos;t want to , that &apos;s your choice .
today &apos;s about you .
but ...
it &apos;s a long way to the top .
let &apos;s go . you never know what might come up .
we &apos;re climbing all the way up to the top ?
oh , yeah .
well , can &apos;t you do one of your super power
vampire jumpy things ?
no , it &apos;s your last day as a human .
why cheat now ?
look who &apos;s dumb enough to come back .
well , somebody had to invite him in .
damon .
would you like to , uh ,
come in ?
are you trying to get me killed ?
i gave you vervain ,
now i &apos;m here to collect .
i got it from here , rick .
you sure ? yeah , only one of us
needs to get blamed for this . get back in the house .
keep elena from handing herself over .
ok . get blamed for what ?
i need to know where klaus is keeping his werewolf .
why ? what are you going to do ?
dead werewolf equals no ritual .
no .
you can &apos;t interfere , damon .
klaus will kill you and everyone you &apos;ve ever met .
i just need to delay this thing .
no . no way .
you should like this . it &apos;s going to buy another month
of your pathetic life .
right . except that i &apos;m not the vampire
he &apos;s planning on sacrificing .
what ?
yeah .
he &apos;s got caroline forbes and tyler lockwood .
therefore , i &apos;m in the clear .
and where &apos;d he get that idea from ?
hey , hey , hey , i &apos;m just trying to stay alive
long enough to get myself out of here .
what if i told you elena had vampire blood in her system ?
what ? !
imagine how much fun that
will be competing with elena for stefan &apos;s love
for , i don &apos;t know , forever .
the tomb .
he &apos;s got them in the tomb .
thank you .
tyler ?
you all right ?
yeah .
i think so .
i already tried .
those witches vervained me .
who were they ?
i think they &apos;re with klaus .
who the hell is klaus ?
tyler ...
you shouldn &apos;t have come back here .
i guess bonnie will have to make me a daylight ring .
yeah , piece of cake .
and i &apos;ll never be able to watch &quot; bambi &quot; again .
i definitely wouldn &apos;t recommend that .
what &apos;s the best part about being a vampire ?
you feel like you could do anything .
be anyone .
beautiful things are more beautiful .
everything &apos;s heightened , you know ,
just a little bit more intensely ,
love more powerfully .
and the worst ?
ah , you know the worst .
aside from the blood .
anger becomes rage .
when you &apos;re sad , you &apos;re in despair .
grief .
loss .
it can cripple you .
that &apos;s why so many of us turn our emotions off .
it just becomes ...
too overwhelming .
you know , for a while , for me ,
the good just wasn &apos;t worth the bad .
how long before you learned to handle both ?
well , i &apos;m still trying . every day .
what else ?
let &apos;s just keep going .
we &apos;re not even halfway to the top .
everything ok ?
what have you been doing ?
making coffee . do you want some ?
tell me what you &apos;ve been doing .
making coffee .
wait .
take off your bracelet .
now .
i want you ...
to walk over to the window
and stand in the sunlight .
but i &apos;ll burn .
you don &apos;t have a choice .
that &apos;s enough .
guess i was wrong .
all right , then .
i need you to do something for me .
which one are you trying to save ?
the blond , or the wolf ?
did you really think klaus would leave them unprotected ?
wishful thinking .
what are you doing here ?
where &apos;s caroline ?
listen , man . not a good time to play the hero .
where is she ?
and what did he do to her ?
i &apos;m just here to rescue her , ok ?
you &apos;re lucky i already screwed up once today .
or you &apos;d be dead .
the whole sun and moon curse is fake ?
that &apos;s what elena learned .
klaus still needs to do the sacrifice ,
but it &apos;s just not for that .
and you think that &apos;s why they grabbed us ?
for the sacrifice .
yes .
he &apos;s going to kill us ?
i think so .
yes .
this whole time i &apos;ve been gone ,
jules has been helping me come to terms with what i am .
how to deal with it .
i guess none of it matters anymore .
why didn &apos;t you say good @-@ bye ?
you just left .
you want to talk about this now ?
well , if i &apos;m going to die , i might as well know the truth .
why did you leave me ?
i knew you hated me .
i thought you deserved better
than having someone like me in your life .
i was hurt . you know ,
you turned your back on me when i needed you .
but ...
i could never hate you , tyler .
damon ?
your boyfriend &apos;s outside
with a rifle loaded with wooden bullets .
you have some explaining to do .
what , matt ?
matt knows about you ?
no , i--
tomorrow &apos;s problem .
let me just get you out of here .
wait , damon . no !
i &apos;m not leaving without him .
it &apos;s getting dark soon .
how fast can you get the hell away from here ?
i need to get to my family &apos;s cellar .
i can lock myself up .
i &apos;ll help .
don &apos;t make me regret this .
we made it !
that &apos;s nothing , if you &apos;ve climbed mt . everest .
nobody likes a bragger , stefan .
yeah .
hey , you can say it .
say what ?
the thing you &apos;ve been wanting to say , but ...
been afraid of how it &apos;ll make me feel .
there &apos;s nothing i can say , stefan .
it &apos;s not going to change anything .
might make you feel better .
look , i know this isn &apos;t the first time you &apos;ve thought about it .
drinking vampire blood to survive .
i mean , i know i &apos;ve thought about it a hundred times .
and before all this with klaus , did you think about it then ?
of course i did .
elena ...
if it were my choice ,
i &apos;d want to be with you forever .
why have you never brought it up ?
&apos;cause i knew if it was an option , you would have .
it would be selfish for me to ask you .
didn &apos;t stop damon .
he shouldn &apos;t have done what he did .
he did it because he loves you .
but he did this to me , stefan , which means
he doesn &apos;t really know what love is .
and to be honest , i don &apos;t know if i do ...
i &apos;m 17 years old .
how am i supposed to know any of this yet ?
i know that i love you , stefan .
i know that .
but my future ? our lives together ?
those were things i was supposed to deal with
as they came along .
i was supposed to grow up .
decide if i want to have kids
and start a family . grow old .
i was supposed to have a lifetime of those choices ,
and ... now ?
that &apos;s all gone .
elena , say it .
please .
i don &apos;t want to be a vampire , stefan .
i never wanted to be one .
i know .
it &apos;s ok .
matt !
did you hit him ?
did you already forget the
part about the gun with the wooden bullets ?
tyler ?
it &apos;s starting .
grab boy wonder and let &apos;s go .
come on .
thanks for today .
you got me all nervous .
i thought maybe you &apos;d done something stupid .
you ready , my dear ?
i &apos;m ready .
no .
i wouldn &apos;t .
no reason for you to die , too .
no .
stefan , hey , hey , it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
i &apos;ll go .
no one needs to get hurt .
there &apos;s no reason for you to get hurt .
i love you .
i love you .
close your eyes .
close your eyes .
there you are . i got here , the house was empty .
where &apos;s damon ?
what &apos;s happening ? is he ok ?
he better not wolf out on us .
bad time , little bro .
what the hell are you doing ?
saving the day . i figured you &apos;d understand .
just tell elena to stay put .
she &apos;s already gone , damon .
what ?
klaus came .
he took her .
i &apos;ll take care of it .
tyler !
oh , god !
i don &apos;t know if i can hold it off . get out of here .
tyler , it &apos;ll be ok .
go !
you &apos;ve got time . we &apos;re almost there , just--
it &apos;s happening faster .
tyler , it &apos;s ok .
damon
i &apos;m fine .
get out of here !
get to the lockwood cellar .
if it held him in , it &apos;ll keep him out .
if it doesn &apos;t ... use these .
it &apos;ll buy you a couple seconds .
go . go !
where &apos;s maddox ?
he should be back by now .
i don &apos;t know .
what are you doing ?
where &apos;s elena ?
i sent her off with greta .
it &apos;s almost time .
i wasn &apos;t aware you &apos;d been invited in .
i &apos;ve come here to tell you that you have to postpone the ritual .
didn &apos;t we already have this conversation ?
yeah , but that was before i rescued your werewolf
and vampire and killed your witch .
excuse me ?
and you can kill me for it . i don &apos;t care .
it was all me .
katerina , give us a moment .
i &apos;ve heard about you .
the crazy , impulsive vampire .
in love with his brother &apos;s girl .
i knew one of you would try to stop me .
it was a just a 50 / 50 guess on who .
the nice thing about werewolves
is they tend to travel in packs .
need a closer look ?
jules .
when you spend a thousand years
trying to break a curse ...
you learn a thing or two .
first rule--
always have a back @-@ up .
back @-@ up werewolf .
back @-@ up witch .
back @-@ up vampire .
i &apos;ve got that covered , too .
come on , down here .
is that going to hold ?
no .
help me with the gate . help me with the gate .
tyler ?
it &apos;s me . it &apos;s caroline .
tyler ?
hey . damon .
hey . damon .
what the hell happened ?
he &apos;s gone . he went to do the ritual . i &apos;m sorry .
i had to . he would have
known that i was on vervain if i didn &apos;t do it .
ahh . do what ?
klaus . he made me call her to lure her out .
he needed another vampire .
who did you call ?
who did you call , katherine ?
where are we going ?
this way .
you &apos;re luka &apos;s sister , aren &apos;t you ?
i heard about you .
he and your father were looking for you .
well , they were wasting their time .
i wasn &apos;t lost .
god , i can &apos;t see anything .
jenna ?
jenna , jenna !
jenna ? hey , hey , jenna !
jenna !
oh , my god . no .
jenna ! no !
he killed her ?
why ? i did everything that he asked .
she &apos;s not dead .
she &apos;s in transition .
should have used me .
why didn &apos;t he use me ?
he couldn &apos;t .
damon , he said you were as good as dead .
what does that even mean ?
what does that mean ?
what is this , damon ?
