please ! call 911 !
oh , my god !
oh , my god ! aah !
aah ! help !
it is now 3 hours and counting since 4 @-@ year @-@ old gabby hoffer
was abducted from her cousin sue walsh &apos;s car .
why would anyone leave a little girl alone in a car at night ?
sue told local authorities
that she was a couple blocks from her house ,
she didn &apos;t want to wake gabby up ,
she was in and out of that mini mart in under 4 minutes .
that &apos;s a pretty tight window of opportunity .
whoever took her must have been stalking them .
is there a history of child abductions in this area ?
no , but the local registry
shows a high concentration of sex offenders .
we have no time to waste .
we do have an eyewitness , but his recollection &apos;s
limited to a dark van that he saw pull up next to sue &apos;s car .
that &apos;s pretty vague .
so we don &apos;t have a color
or know who was driving .
are their surveillance cameras on the premises ?
yes , there was one camera , it &apos;s in the store , and it &apos;s ancient ,
but the footage is being sent to the lab right now for enhancement .
ssa canning is on scene
with the southeast regional card team .
they &apos;re conducting neighborhood and roadblock canvasses .
we all know what to do .
if this is a stranger abduction ,
we &apos;ve got fewer than 24 hours
to bring gabby back alive .
it &apos;s often said there is no footprint too small
to leave an imprint on this world .
garcia , where are gabby &apos;s parents ?
away , but not together .
they &apos;re divorced .
mom , kate ,
is coming back from a caribbean cruise with her new boyfriend .
and doug , gabby &apos;s bio dad ,
is a long @-@ haul trucker who is on the road .
and this is where bad turns to worse .
dad has a history of drug problems .
since gabby &apos;s under 5 years old
and her father &apos;s whereabouts are unknown ,
statistics say he &apos;s more likely the offender
than the stranger abduction .
he could have been the one who stalked them and grabbed gabby .
morgan , you and jj head over to sue walsh &apos;s house .
see if any of the neighbors have seen gabby &apos;s father lurking around .
all right . got it .
a possible abduction
and an amber alert out on a gabby hoffer ...
5 hours and 23 minutes since gabby was taken .
witness pulled up to pump number 2 here ,
saw the van parked there .
blocked his view of sue &apos;s car .
said the brake lights were on .
the driver could have kept his foot on the brake
while someone else used the sliding door to grab her .
it &apos;d be smart to use a partner out in the open like this .
we have 9 registered sex offenders within 3 miles .
sometimes they work in tandem .
we have teams going door to door now .
that &apos;s good , cover your bases .
but it &apos;s the ones we don &apos;t know about
who are the most dangerous .
what &apos;s the word on the parents ?
mom and boyfriend rodney are confirmed off conus .
they &apos;ll be at the p.d. soon .
we have any location on the biological father yet ?
still not answering his cell phone .
it &apos;s not pinging off any towers , either .
so he shut his cell phone off .
that &apos;s odd for a trucker .
unless it &apos;s a countermeasure .
the dark van could have just been a transport vehicle
to get gabby to his truck .
you &apos;re thinking he waited for the opportunity to take her ?
he has motivation given that he lost custody .
we should check rest stops for his truck as well .
the problem is interstate 59 is just 3 blocks away ,
and it goes to louisiana , alabama , and georgia .
we &apos;ve got the borders covered .
nobody &apos;s getting out of here without a fight .
agent canning , can you get video footage for us from a 5 @-@ mile radius ?
we need to see if there &apos;s any video of this dark van
coming or going .
not much hope there .
katrina took out a lot of the security and traffic cams .
they haven &apos;t been replaced .
is sue inside ? we need to talk to her .
an agent drove her home and is staying with her
in case there are any ransom demands .
she &apos;s a wreck . not sure you &apos;ll get anything new .
excuse me .
all right . blake , you and reid stay with canning &apos;s people .
if gabby was a victim of opportunity ,
then the unsubs didn &apos;t have a plan
and they could still be in the area .
dave and i will go to the police station
and interview kate and the boyfriend .
is she awake ?
did you find gabby ?
no , not yet .
but we could use your help .
i &apos;m agent jareau . this is agent morgan .
mind if we have a seat ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry . have a seat .
so , um , when we handle these ca--
when we handle these cases ,
we start by eliminating family
and work our way out from there .
so , do you have any brothers or sisters ?
no .
kate &apos;s the only family that i got .
she &apos;s more like a sister to me than a cousin .
her parents took me in after mine died .
i &apos;m so sorry . how old were you ?
8 .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s all right . we know this is a tough time .
did anyone take special interest in gabby
since you &apos;ve had her ?
no . no .
i always had her right by my side of me ...
except ...
i was only gone like one second .
i got her to sleep finally and i didn &apos;t want to wake her .
there &apos;s nothing you can do about that now , ok ?
you just need to focus on finding her .
so think back .
was there a deliveryman ? a service worker ?
no .
a neighbor ?
no , nobody .
i don &apos;t know , maybe everybody .
i mean , she &apos;s so nice . she smiles at everybody .
what about her father ? have you seen him ?
has he contacted you ?
no . he &apos;s always on the road . he never calls .
did he know that you were watching gabby ?
i don &apos;t think so .
ok , sue . do you know anyone with a dark van ?
no . no .
i &apos;m sorry . i just can &apos;t even believe this is happening right now .
well , you &apos;re the best at finding kids .
you &apos;re gonna find gabby , right ?
god , just tell me something ,
&apos;cause right now all i can tell myself
is i never , ever should have left her .
i need your help .
anything .
tell me about gabby .
she &apos;s just about the sweetest little girl you &apos;ve ever met .
and how long have you been seeing kate ?
almost a year .
she &apos;s the best person i know .
nearly eloped on that cruise , but we wanted gabby there for it .
has gabby ever wandered off with anyone ?
no .
a stranger ?
no . there &apos;s just no way .
i warned her too much about that .
what about with someone she knew ?
like who ?
doug ? he hasn &apos;t seen her for almost a year .
oh , god .
oh , god , you think that man took my little girl ?
do you know where doug is right now ?
he &apos;s on the road , somewhere .
oh , god , he did it , didn &apos;t he ?
he swore that he would get back at me for leaving him
and he &apos;s finally done it .
we don &apos;t know that .
but that son of a bitch is your number one suspect , isn &apos;t he ?
how would you get in touch with him if it were an emergency ?
he has two cell phone numbers .
one is personal and one is a company road one for emergencies .
garcia , i need you to track gps on this cell phone number .
601 ...
555 @-@ 0181 .
think maybe she might know a thing or two
about what goes on around here ?
kind of late to be taking the trash out , isn &apos;t it ?
they only come once a week and i don &apos;t want the house stinking .
you here to find gabby ?
yeah . and we could use your help .
when &apos;s the last time you saw her ?
when sue took her for a ride .
a few hours ago ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t sleep so good anymore .
any little noise wakes me .
have you seen a dark van ?
not tonight .
but one came through the other day .
think he &apos;s a plumber .
can you remember the company name ?
all right . thank you .
she &apos;s seen a van .
please tell me she &apos;s safe .
not yet , but we &apos;ve got a lead on a dark van .
it could belong to a plumber .
check local businesses .
well , that &apos;s hardly anything .
you &apos;ve had less .
true .
come on , baby girl , we need an i.d. and location right now .
uh , there are 4 plumbers in the immediate area .
i &apos;m pulling registrations .
uh , white minivans are all the rage .
there &apos;s the little family plumber .
they have a bluish van that &apos;s dark .
run employee background checks .
won &apos;t be hard . it &apos;s only the owner
and his nephew , ian little , 25 .
he was released last year , for slinging bennies and heroin .
where is he now ?
sleeping , i imagine .
i &apos;m sending you his home address . there it is .
hattiesburg p.d. got a call about an abandoned truck .
found the phone under the seat .
just got confirmation . truck belongs to doug hoffer ,
gabby &apos;s father .
this is only 5 miles from the abduction site .
it was smart to leave it out here .
the property owners streamed the video
from that camera to my phone .
we have the truck being parked here sunday .
did he walk back into town ?
no . a little tough to see ,
but he was definitely picked up by a dark minivan .
tell me you have a license plate .
yeah . just i.d. the owner .
ian little .
what is he doing here ?
what the hell happened to his face ?
you know him .
yeah . doug used to buy drugs from him .
do you think ian helped him take gabby ?
what &apos;s his story ?
claims he hasn &apos;t seen gabby in months
but admits that he picked up doug on sunday .
well , he &apos;s smart to admit it , since we &apos;ve got his mug
on surveillance cameras .
ooh , that &apos;s gotta hurt .
those look like second- and third @-@ degree burns .
he hasn &apos;t had proper medical attention .
looks infected .
says he was trying to light his gas grill
and he left the propane on
while he went back inside to get matches .
he returned , struck the match ,
and it blew up in his face .
oh , that doesn &apos;t make sense . propane dissipates .
this would take serious flames
to curl around and burn behind his ears .
who gets those kind of burns who doesn &apos;t go to the hospital ?
someone who has something to hide .
there are no calls ,
but ian &apos;s cell pinged off of 3 cell phone towers
outside of town on sunday , monday , and tuesday .
i sent you the locations .
cell tower range and directionality
can be dramatically influenced by atmospheric ,
electromagnetic , and traffic capacity variations .
meaning ?
a cell phone can travel to the same location
but ping off of different towers on different days
due to independent outside variables .
garcia , can you see what &apos;s at this intersection point ?
39 @-@ 30 latitude ,
negative 89 @-@ 42 longitude .
uh , that would be the old little farm .
and that &apos;s little , not like diminutive , but little family .
that &apos;s where ian grew up .
so doug went missing 3 nights ago
and ian &apos;s been at that farm each night since then .
holy crappy childhood .
you can &apos;t make this kind of sadness up .
it &apos;s also the place where ian &apos;s dad killed his mother
with a shotgun and then turned it on himself .
i &apos;m agent hotchner . i don &apos;t have any time to waste ,
so i &apos;m going to give you once chance to answer my questions .
i know the story about how you got these burns is a lie .
these are the kinds of burns we see when people add gasoline to a fire ,
like when they &apos;re trying to get rid of a body .
is that what you did ? yes or no .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i also know exactly where you spent the last 3 nights .
you picked up doug on sunday
and you let him hide here , didn &apos;t you ?
he waited there for a few days ,
you drove him into town
in your van to try to abduct his daughter ,
and something went wrong and doug hurt gabby
and you were left with a dead little girl
and you thought you knew how to get rid of her .
i want a lawyer .
that &apos;s all right .
i have my answers .
i have a team searching the farm right now ,
and they will find the body .
who the hell is that ?
it &apos;s our main suspect .
searched the entire property .
we found ian &apos;s van in the barn .
no sign of gabby anywhere . what have you got ?
coroner says doug died from blunt force trauma to the head .
then it looks like ian tried to burn doug &apos;s body here ,
which , of course , was harder than he thought it would be ,
so then he dumped doug &apos;s body in the water .
sounds like rage followed
by just about every disposal method that we know of .
even wrapped the body , weighed it down with rocks .
could it be remorse ?
it &apos;s more like concealment .
we see it a lot
when there &apos;s a connection between the vic and the killer .
coroner says doug &apos;s been dead for at least 72 hours .
that would be the same day he got here .
so what did this guy do to get himself killed ?
let me make sure i understand , agent .
you said that gabby was never there .
that &apos;s right , she wasn &apos;t .
but ian killed doug .
he must have had something to do with taking her .
let me talk to ian .
i &apos;m sorry , we can &apos;t let you do that .
oh , but he will talk to me .
well , oh , god , when doug and i first got together ,
we smoked a little weed with ian ,
and then i got pregnant with gabby
and i realized that i needed to quit all that stuff .
you know , i--i wanted to be a good mom .
i &apos;m just saying that ian and i go way back ,
and he will tell me stuff that he may not tell you guys .
because , honestly ,
him hurting gabby just-- it doesn &apos;t make any sense to me .
i &apos;m sorry , but ian isn &apos;t speaking to anyone ,
except maybe a lawyer .
i &apos;m so sorry .
card team found this on the interstate .
what is it ?
it looks like gabby &apos;s blanket to me .
ask your client .
i have no idea .
i advise you not to waste my time .
where is gabby ?
where is she ? !
i don &apos;t know .
i swear .
i &apos;m sorry . i just ran in for a second .
i would never leave her like that .
ok , i understand this is difficult ,
but what i need you both to do right now
is focus on finding gabby ,
getting her back in your arms .
can you do that ?
ok .
excuse me .
the mini mart video &apos;s back from the lab .
i &apos;ve looked through the whole thing . sue &apos;s story holds up .
fast @-@ forward to sue &apos;s arrival at 10 : 03 p.m.
cashier was the only one inside until then .
hold on .
let me rewind .
right there--is that sue &apos;s shirt ?
she didn &apos;t mention
walking to the door and then turning around .
how long before she actually goes in ?
two minutes later .
maybe she was worried about leaving gabby alone in the car .
well , there were plenty of places to park
right in front of the store .
she chose the side . no windows , no lights .
she told us she didn &apos;t want the lights
or the noise to wake gabby up .
right , but as a woman ,
especially one with a small child ,
safety comes first .
it &apos;s instinctual to find a quick ,
well @-@ lit journey from your parked car to the door .
it could have been a trial run .
we see that in inexperienced criminals
who need to build up their nerve .
wait a minute . you thinking she did all of this ?
go .
see if there &apos;s any recent contact
between ian little and sue walsh .
scanning slimeball &apos;s cell now .
not a lot of repeat numbers .
trick of the trade , disposable cells .
ok .
oh , there are dozens of calls
to and from this number , though ,
and i &apos;m gonna cross @-@ check it with sue walsh &apos;s home .
we have a match . yeah .
they talked . they talked .
here you go .
oh , thanks .
thank you .
sue , we need a formal statement .
would you mind coming with me .
oh , of course not .
did you ever have any hesitation leaving gabby with sue ?
well , why would i ?
like a mother &apos;s intuition thing .
did you ever feel like there was anything wrong ?
sue didn &apos;t have a problem with it ,
and gabby &apos;s spent the night there before .
why are you asking me this ?
we &apos;re trying to put some missing pieces together .
ok .
do you know ian little ?
kind of . he comes into the diner a few times a week .
we &apos;ve got phone records that show you talk to ian ...
a lot .
please don &apos;t tell kate .
i mean , she never would have let gabby come over
if she knew that he was coming around .
why is a smart girl like you hanging out with this guy ?
he &apos;s better now . he &apos;s cleaned up .
and he &apos;s different with me .
i &apos;m really good for him .
you lost your parents when you were young .
what does that have to do with anything ?
well , maybe it gives you the attention that you need .
yeah , i guess so .
you say ian &apos;s clean ?
is he still dealing ?
no , uh----
i don &apos;t think so .
then why would ian kill gabby &apos;s father ?
uh ... i don &apos;t know .
maybe it was an old grudge
or a bad deal or something .
ok .
now ...
we need your full statement .
ok .
are you sure you &apos;ll be able to write with that hand ?
oh . yeah .
uh , gabby broke a glass .
kids .
uh , what exactly am i supposed to write ?
just tell us what happened .
ok .
we know that ian picked up doug on sunday ,
then he was killed .
what if they surprised sue at the house ?
and doug was threatening to take gabby .
they could have been trying to protect gabby from him
and he was killed by accident .
except they went to extravagant lengths to cover it up .
ok , that may be true , but it still doesn &apos;t answer where gabby is
or what anyone &apos;s motivation is in hurting her .
we can keep theorizing , but every minute we do
is a minute gabby &apos;s out there .
dave .
we want the truth from your client .
what are you offering ?
that depends on whether he fully cooperates .
my client did not kill doug hoffer .
he only disposed of the body .
prove it , and the ausa has agreed to plead him
from murder to accessory after the fact .
he knows who did it .
that &apos;s hearsay , it &apos;s not proof .
she cut her hand when she hit him with that candle holder .
they were arguing by the front door .
she &apos;s my daughter , and i am going to see her .
doug went in to go get gabby out of bed .
sue picks up this candle holder
and hit him really hard with it .
it sounded really bad .
it was heavy glass and it broke when she hit him again .
her blood was all over .
guys , over here .
so was doug &apos;s .
she hid it in a shoebox in the closet .
why would she keep the murder weapon ?
she thinks she &apos;s too smart to get caught .
are you all right ?
did you find gabby ?
what do you think ?
are we gonna find her ?
kate trusted you with the care of her child .
you were responsible for this little girl .
you had a duty to protect her ,
and you failed ,
miserably .
what happened to gabby is all your fault .
you know nothing about what it takes to be a mother .
you &apos;re pathetic .
aah ! you son of a bitch !
i &apos;ll kill you !
get off me !
get off me ! no !
no ! get off me !
talk about taking one for the team .
what was that all about ?
if she &apos;s a predisposed female offender ,
a major indicator is uncontrolled rage when challenged .
i &apos;d say she passed the test .
she has no criminal record , no history of violence .
they &apos;re very good at concealment .
they &apos;re also the rarest type .
they go after young children in their care ,
and their offenses can be sadistic , brutal ,
sometimes bizarre .
the blunt force trauma that killed doug
says that she has serious violence issues .
something must have triggered that rage .
whatever it was , i &apos;m afraid of what that means for gabby .
i know sue is not gonna talk to us ,
but maybe she would talk to kate .
she did that to you and you want kate going in there ?
rodney , i &apos;ve got to go talk to her .
she &apos;s restrained . i will be at the door .
there &apos;s nothing she can do physically to hurt her .
what is wrong with you ?
you still don &apos;t get it , do you ?
i trusted you .
and i trusted you .
what are you talking about ?
when i moved into your perfect little house ,
your perfect little street ,
everybody told me that i lucked out ,
that i got myself a good family .
well , i had a good family . i didn &apos;t want yours .
what happened to your family wasn &apos;t fair ,
but why would you take that out on gabby ?
at first i thought that it wasn &apos;t only me that he touched .
what are you talking about ?
where is gabby ?
gabby &apos;s gone .
what ?
now you know how i used to feel .
like there &apos;s no air left .
where ?
for a really long time ,
i thought that &apos;s just how things worked in your family .
&apos;cause your dad liked me to sit on his lap ,
till it got more than that .
i used to stay up late at night
to see if he opened your door , too .
but he didn &apos;t .
just mine .
he always did say that i was his special little girl .
that &apos;s not true .
my dad never touched you .
he used to put me on the floor &apos; cause it was quieter .
when he was done ,
i &apos;d put the lightbug on and i &apos;d go under the bed .
that &apos;s where i sleep , but not you .
you got all the good memories .
you &apos;re insane .
maybe i am .
what does that make you ?
you left your kid for 5 days .
all i know is that i will never
let mine out of my sight .
she &apos;ll be here in the summertime .
oh , my god .
she mixed her past and present tenses ,
which shows unconscious deception .
have a seat .
oh , god , she never mentioned gabby .
and she said my dad-- oh , god .
don &apos;t let her get to you . your dad &apos;s a good man .
we all know she &apos;s lying .
she &apos;s never going to tell us where gabby is .
you got her to reveal more than you know .
kate &apos;s right .
sue &apos;s never gonna tell us where gabby is .
it &apos;s her final move to punish kate .
she wants to inflict maximum pain upon kate .
so you &apos;re thinking she &apos;ll do whatever it takes
to make kate suffer and keep on suffering .
not knowing what happened to your child
would be the ultimate torture for any parent .
but if sue killed gabby ,
chances are eventually we &apos;d find the body .
she &apos;d need to find a way to get rid of her permanently ,
without killing her .
nothing &apos;s out of place .
in fact , all of gabby &apos;s things are packed up
as if she was preparing to go back home .
that &apos;s strong evidence of a false allegation .
so all of this was arranged by sue for what ,
to get back at kate ?
you should have seen her with kate .
she was relentlessly sadistic .
so sue planned this with whoever was in the dark van .
but there doesn &apos;t seem to be any paper trail of it here .
and there &apos;s not electronic trail either .
there &apos;s no computer or cell phone .
outside of a land line , this girl &apos;s living tech @-@ free .
that &apos;s because she &apos;s hiding something .
yeah . i agree .
thanks .
i &apos;m going to call garcia .
mama , is it even possible
for somebody to live completely offline these days ?
sure , if you live in an afghani cave
or certain parts of new jersey .
other than that , not so much .
we can &apos;t even find an internet connection
or any communication device in sue &apos;s home .
what , so she &apos;s like old school ? snail mail ? cash transactions ?
yeah , but somehow she had to
connect with whoever actually grabbed gabby .
a girl like that &apos;s gotta go online somewhere .
well , she doesn &apos;t have much money . she &apos;d have to do it cheap .
well--ok , i started my illustrious career
on the web at the library ,
because the computers and the internet are free .
she could have done that using pseudonyms and anonymizers .
i--i know all this , but i &apos;m gonna need some help
if i want to narrow it down quickly .
ok , call blake .
maybe she got something out of sue &apos;s written statement .
good . yes , and thank you . i &apos;m on the trail .
blake , i need your word wisdom
to help me track sue &apos;s online activity .
well , the only thing that stuck out
was her use of lightbug instead of lightbulb .
i heard her say it to kate and noticed it in her statement , too .
lightbug . got it .
&quot; i &apos;ll switch the lightbug off in the car so no one will see . &quot;
where did you find that ?
backtracking now ...
oh , no .
it &apos;s an online forum
discussing a troubled 4 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
any identifying information on who she &apos;s talking to ?
give me a minute . give me a minute .

no , oh , no . this is gonna be a dead end .
what happened ?
libraries that don &apos;t want feds
tracking what their patrons are reading
or surfing on the web ,
they erase their servers at the end of the night .
can you recover the files ?
if it were done ,
t &apos;were well it were done quickly .
ok , it &apos;s still early .
maybe they haven &apos;t written over the files yet .

yes ! ok , i &apos;ve got an ip address fragment and ...
gabby &apos;s not the only baby on that forum
that &apos;s being discussed .
garcia , i need to know everything that you can find
about anyone communicating with sue .
yeah . yeah . i &apos;m good .
oh , my god . oh , no , no , no .
sue gave gabby away .
who has her , garcia ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t--
ok . i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m gonna send you
美国地下领养儿童市场
this online investigative report right now .
read this , and i &apos;m gonna find out who . i &apos;m gonna find out who .
disrupted adoptions ?
that &apos;s what the people involved are calling it .
they &apos;re also referring to it as re @-@ homing .
and it &apos;s been happening underground for some time now .
until now , it &apos;s mainly been overwhelmed adoptive parents
of problem children from overseas .
good people go on the site looking for guidance or services ,
but bad people offer to take problem kids off their hands
as a last resort .
so they just give them away to some random couple ?
calling them couples is a bit generous .
the article talks about these people who pose as families ,
but really , they &apos;re just freaks looking for access to kids .
and no one &apos;s keeping track of them .
why isn &apos;t this illegal ?
well , &apos; cause it &apos;s a relatively new practice ,
and unsurprisingly , no legislation &apos;s been written yet .
so how did sue manage to give gabby away ?
she posed as gabby &apos;s mother
and gave her to a woman
who claimed she knew how to deal with troubled kids .
i want my mommy .
hush , carly .
my name is gabby .
if you cry , bad things will happen .
garcia , we &apos;re out of time . we need something .
ok . there are 3 families who responded to sue &apos;s post .
do any of them own a dark van ?
there &apos;s a nicole jones .
she owns a blue &apos; 03 caravan .
she lives in a shack 20 miles south
of where you are off of interstate 59 .
let &apos;s go .
clear !
clear !
guys !
d @-@ don &apos;t shoot me .
where &apos;s gabby hoffer ?
she &apos;s gone .
she &apos;s still not talking .
she must have panicked and gotten rid of gabby .
garcia , who else from the area answered sue &apos;s post ?
uh ... there &apos;s one woman , michelle fader .
she ran in the same sick circles .
and she owns an old van .
this fader &apos;s a real winner .
she was evicted from her last known address .
they probably won &apos;t risk going back towards the abduction site ,
which means they &apos;re headed southwest .
let &apos;s go .
ok . the woman i hope you &apos;re about to arrest
had all of her biological kids taken from her 5 years ago
because another child died while in her custody .
she was never charged ?
oh , no , she was , but for neglect .
she didn &apos;t spend a minute in jail .
social workers haven &apos;t come by her house at all
because none of her kids are in her custody .
and they have no idea she &apos;s been finding new children online .
those poor little darlings are being treated like trash .
they don &apos;t know that anybody cares .
we care . we care .
garcia , widen your search
to any know male associates of michelle fader .
yeah , will do .
ohh . i got a picture of fader with some guy
who could win sleaze of the century award .
he &apos;s got his arm all possessively around this sweet little girl .
run facial recognition software and get an i.d. on him .
ok , i got a match . michael feehan .
he is the perv in the picture with fader .
he &apos;s not in any registries ,
but he has got a list of accusations .
none of them were proven
because all of the victims were too young .
garcia , did you get the address ?
running it now .
police , give me a reason .
what the hell &apos;s goin &apos; on ? !
michelle fader , you &apos;re under arrest for staging a child abduction .
i didn &apos;t do nothin &apos; . look , i was trying to help that girl .
you have the right to remain silent .
i am only trying to help that girl .
she wanted a fresh start .
anything you say can and
will be held against you in a court of law .
she couldn &apos;t take care of her own babies anymore .
you have a right to an attorney ...
i am trying to help that girl !
you have a right to an attorney ...
what &apos;s gonna happen to my babies ?
i &apos;ve got gabby .
and there are other kids back here .
are you ok ?
can you take me home now ?
yes , sweetheart .
ok , come on .
up you go .
mama !
oh , my sweet baby !
i missed you , mama .
i missed you so much .
why are you sad ?
i &apos;m not sad .
so those are happy tears ?
yep .
we &apos;re never , ever gonna leave you .
jj ... you ok ?
they don &apos;t have any place safe to be .
it &apos;s not ideal , but they &apos;ll be in foster care
until they find a family .
yeah , but how many more kids like that are out there ?
that &apos;s a good question .
hey , sweetness ,
thought you might want to see something .
what ?
mmm , mmm , we &apos;re gonna go home now and you can ...
have a good meal .
oh , ho ho ho . i needed that .
&quot; a mother &apos;s arms are made of tenderness ,
and children sleep soundly in them . &quot;
