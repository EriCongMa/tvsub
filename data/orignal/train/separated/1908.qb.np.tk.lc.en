&quot; puttin &apos; on the ritz &quot;
as anyone who &apos;s ever had their tonsils out can tell you ,
surgery isn &apos;t cheap .
it takes a lot of money to keep a hospital &apos;s doors open .
and when the fund &apos;s run out ,
it &apos;s on us to get out there and raise some more .
which means ...
it &apos;s time to put on makeup .
it &apos;s time to dress up right .
it &apos;s time to get things started on &quot; the muppet show &quot; to--
crap . sorry .
i &apos;ve been watching a lot of children &apos;s television lately .
are we ready to go ?
but you get the idea .
uh , almost . someone doesn &apos;t want to put her shoes on .
can i just get a word ?
hey .
hey . i , uh ... really hope this red carpet
is something you had laying around the house , avery .
we &apos;re trying to raise money tonight , not waste it .
i grew up in this world . i know how it works .
we &apos;re attracting serious people with serious money
and tailoring an event to them .
tonight is gonna be tasteful , sophisticated , conservative .
come in .
you and i have very different definitions
of the word &quot; conservative . &quot;
cheers !
ari ... what did you spend my money on ?
this is what you want . you want spectacle-- pizzazz .
do i look like someone who wants pizzazz ?
when people think of hospitals ,
they think of death , disease ... old people .
not sexy . we are giving them las vegas .
we are giving them a show .
people are more inclined to open their wallets
if they &apos;re having fun .
he &apos;s falling apart .
he &apos;s refused to use incentive spirometry .
look , and his right lung is just about ready to collapse .
if he wants to suffer , then maybe we let him .
oh , so you &apos;re gonna let him die because he hurt your feelings ?
there isn &apos;t anything that he can say to me
that i haven &apos;t heard from my mother a thousand times .
i &apos;m bulletproof .
but we can force all the treatment on him we want .
it won &apos;t make a difference
if he decides he does not want to fight for himself .
maybe he just needs to see what it feels like to hit bottom .
dr. bailey ?
radiology wants to see you
regarding gene steer &apos;s p.e.t. scan results .
um , call respiratory , and get dr. webber started on c.p.a.p.
oh , he is not going to like that .
he doesn &apos;t have to like it .
he just has to do it .
trade assignments with me .
no .
you &apos;re in a bad mood because your crappy boyfriend
didn &apos;t invite you to the gala .
but you know what &apos;s gonna make you feel better ?
spending a night on the peds floor ...
with all of the delightful little children .
or i could just punch my crappy boyfriend in the junk .
why not both ?
shane , trade with me .
i &apos;m a surgeon , not a babysitter .
me either . why do i get screwed ?
cruel twist of fate ?
hey ! ross . edwards .
it &apos;s just the two of you down here tonight ,
so if you find yourselves in over your head ,
call a grown @-@ up .
if c.t. &apos; s nagative , give him fluids and send him home .
don &apos;t we look spiffy .
yeah , i do .
you look like crap .
i haven &apos;t had a chance to freshen up yet , you ass .
watch your back ! coming through !
holy heck .
hey , what &apos;s the story ?
once upon a time , three idiots got wasted
and ran their car into a tree .
they &apos;re drunk ?
no , high as kites .
lucky they were the only ones that got hurt .
hey , sinatra , i &apos;ll give you a fiver for a glass of wine .
sir , what &apos;d you take ?
it &apos;s heroin . add a tox screen to their trauma labs .
what &apos;s your name ?
no i.d. on any of &apos; em .
we &apos;ve been going with john , jerry , and jake doe .
cute .
okay , let &apos;s hustle , get a full trauma workup
so i can get upstairs and run a brush through my hair .
meredith grey , as i live and breathe .
i haven &apos;t seen you in ages . how &apos;s , uh ...
derek liking maternity leave ?
he &apos;s on paternity leave .
yeah , okay .
we have a deal .
i don &apos;t work . neither does he .
it &apos;s working out well .
i live in your house . you &apos;re bored out of your minds .
yeah , they &apos;ve got all this pent @-@ up surgical energy
and now everything &apos;s a competition .
it is not .
and he &apos;s winning .
oh . he is not winning .
he couldn &apos;t even get zola to put her shoes on tonight .
i did that . i got her to put her shoes on .
so i &apos;m winning .
i need to come back to work .
drink ?
ooh . excuse me .
that &apos;s the creepiest waiter i &apos;ve ever seen .
bailey &apos;s gonna lose her mind . she can &apos;t stand clowns .
this is gonna be hilarious .
bailey &apos;s not coming .
what ? ! wait , we can do that ?
okay , i have been dreading having to be in the same room
with arizona . if this isn &apos;t mandatory , i &apos;m going home .
wait , nobody &apos;s going home .
i &apos;m giving 10 % of tonight &apos;s take
to the department that raises the most money .
spread the ... word .
derek is really good at this kind of thing .
i should get started before he does .
oh , i think he already has .
amazing .
oh , come on .
i have to confess something . i know who you are .
i saw your video from the t.e.d. conference
and i just -- i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m a little starstruck .
really ?
yeah ... you know , i go every year , and ...
so many of the talks often focus on the tech
or something clever , but yours ...
you spoke from the heart . you might be surprised ...
... the truth . you &apos;re an inspiration .
if i lost my wife in a plane crash --
oh , i &apos;m sorry . what ?
your wife . she ... passed away , right ?
yes ... she did .
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s been really hard .
cristina .
you and i have to join forces
so that derek does not win avery &apos;s money .
prison &apos;s changed you .
we are in trouble .
avery bet the farm on this party .
listen to you two .
this is not that difficult . just be charming .
use the same skills you would if you were
picking someone up at a bar . i know you know how to do that .
and you need to practice
if we &apos;re gonna get serious about meeting new people .
you need to let that go .
ooh , richie rich , 10 : 00 .
mr. steers , i know this is hard to hear ,
but the p.e.t. scan showed your cancer has spread .
i &apos;m afraid surgery is no longer an option .
i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s hard --
this pillow .
why don &apos;t you have that oriental nurse bring me a new one ?
gene ... we &apos;ve talked about this .
victoria is from the philippines .
that &apos;s what i said .
no , it isn &apos;t !
okay , fine .
so no surgery . what &apos;s that mean ?
more chemo ? what &apos;s the next step ?
we talked about worst case scenarios
before the p.e.t. scan , and ...
this ... is it .
um , these are brochures from several local facilities
that can help ease you into the final stages .
when you &apos;re ready , we can talk about which might be the best fit .
best fit is gonna be the one with topless nurses .
i don &apos;t need any of that fully nude business .
they don &apos;t serve booze at the joints
where the girls ditch their skivvies .
matter of fact , how about i slip you a tenner ,
you slip me a bottle of somethin &apos; ?
i &apos;ll be available when you &apos;re ready to talk about your options .
i &apos;ll call if i start to feel weepy .
what are you doing ?
eating shrimp at a party .
i just spent 20 minutes talking to donors about you
when they &apos;d prefer to be talking to you .
you need to -- alex ...
have you been listening to me ?
i gotta get some air .
alex !
where the hell are you going ?
hey , jackson !
champagne ?
this is amazing !
oh , the magician ... incredible .
this is warm .
oh , yeah , big bird said there &apos;s no ice .
apparently , a miscommunication between the caterer and the venue .
cooling blankets .
we have some back at the hospital .
they can bring a patient &apos;s temperature down in minutes , right ?
no reason those can &apos;t chill a bottle .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
then it &apos;s on theme for the night .
and i can &apos;t leave .
um ... could you please run back and grab &apos; em ?
what ? no , but , uh , the magician is the--
please ?
please ...
fine .
and that is not even close to the strangest thing i &apos;ve seen .
though , honestly , that story i don &apos;t think is , uh ...
appropriate .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what , chief .
i &apos;m gonna take a walk over to that table ,
and i &apos;m gonna stick a little somethin &apos; in that cash box .
now when i come back ,
maybe you &apos;ll be a little less reluctant
to give up the goods , owen .
well , now i want to hear that story .
emma marling .
owen hunt .
oh , chief of surgery .
well , i guess grey sloan is pulling out its &quot; a &quot; game tonight .
i wasn &apos;t sure when i got a load of the clowns .
oh , come on . clowns are great .
people love clowns .
you worried me there for a second .
i was afraid you and i weren &apos;t gonna have anything to talk about .
oh , really ?
hey , um ... buy you a drink ?
isn &apos;t it an open bar ?
the price is right .
okay .
thanks .
what was that ?
what was what ?
that whole sparkly eye thing .
well , i can &apos;t help it if my eyes have a natural sparkle .
you were flirting .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
go juggle some balls .
you just brought a knife to a gun fight .
arizona ?
hey , um ... it turns out we needed more ... i.v. kits up in peds ,
but i can &apos;t seem to find them .
do you need a hand ?
no , no . um , i &apos;ll be fine .
okay . just gonna ...
grab these .
cool .
jake &apos;s febrile and he &apos;s got a crazy @-@ high white count .
you factor in the heroin ,
and we &apos;re probably looking at endocarditis .
and i think he &apos;s got a pericardial effusion .
so he could tamponade at the drop of a hat .
and there &apos;s another multiple trauma on its way in .
this is like medical whac @-@ a @-@ mole . i love it .
kepner said we should call someone if we &apos;re in over our heads .
oh , good . dr. karev .
hey , i just wanted to follow up
on the abdominal pain kid .
c.t. was negative ,
so we gave him a couple fluid boluses and sent him home .
great , uh , what about those guys ?
uh , they &apos;re pretty banged up , but nothing we can &apos;t handle .
great . good . uh , keep it up .
nothing we can &apos;t handle ?
we &apos;ve been preparing for this all year .
they have their party tonight . this is ours . enjoy it .
oh , he &apos;s bleeding from his chest tube .
did you check his coags ?
uh , they &apos;re still pending .
uh , get me a petroleum dressing and some gauze !
and call x @-@ ray to get here stat !
doctors ! incoming !
you want to call someone , or do you wanna be a rock star ?
somebody call the blood bank ,
make sure they &apos;ve got plenty of o @-@ neg on deck .
i want those trauma rooms ready for action .
anyone who can be moved , move them !
we need all the empty beds we can get !
hey ! you heard her . lock and load !
okay , let &apos;s move !
i know , look .
isn &apos;t that something ?
you pulled a sleeping baby out of day care to do your dirty work ?
you &apos;re disgusting .
he &apos;s got his mother &apos;s sparkle .
hello , baby .
oh , and he &apos;s hungry .
convenient .
he &apos;s my guy .
i &apos;m gonna kill you dead .
oh , you &apos;re under a lot of pressure at work .
lots of late nights and weekends .
but still , you stay active . lots of , uh , physical activity ?
you can tell all that from my pulse ?
sure ... and the way the tux fits .
oh , my , this watch is gorgeous .
it &apos;s vintage . it was my father &apos;s , actually .
he , uh ... he-- he would wager watches .
and so he won this one .
you know , you need another one .
i &apos;ll be right back .
there is a gal over there doing close @-@ up magic .
you have to see it .
emma marling , this is dr. cristina yang--
our best cardio fellow .
how &apos;s it hanging ?
go on . you &apos;re missing the magic .
whiskey soda .
coming right up .
you are barking up the wrong tree with that one .
you &apos;re never gonna get a donation out of her .
those shoes-- outlet mall all the way .
you want ...
that .
what--that old lady ?
that old lady in chanel . here you go .
thank you .
go get &apos; em , tiger .
it was a beautiful service , but after ...
little sofia just kept asking ...
&quot; why is mommy not coming home with us ? &quot;
you are so strong .
no , it &apos;s--
really , it &apos;s my work that &apos;s kept me strong .
this ... this hospital , you know , these-- these people .
that &apos;s beautiful .
where can i make my donation ?
right over there next to the stairs .
the nights are the hardest , though .
i know exactly what you mean .
ever since harvey died ,
i can &apos;t fall asleep in our bed .
i spend all of my nights on the couch ...
with the cat .
exactly .
wait , what ?
what is the matter with you ?
i @-@ i know this is a difficult time ,
but you cannot talk to my nurses that way .
your move .
what ?
i figured out your problem . your mind is all closed off .
oh--oh , my mind is closed ?
we need to get it fired up so you can figure out
how you &apos;re gonna get this cancer out of me .
here ... i figured you &apos;d want to play black , &apos; cause , well ...
you know .
if there was anything i thought we could try ...
there is .
make a move .
yeah , i have other patients .
i @-@ i can &apos;t just stand here and--
what would rosa parks say ?
excuse me ?
or martin luther king ?
you think they would just stand over there
and make excuses like you are ?
you people are supposed to be tougher than this .
yeah , oh , i believe that you and i
have reached the end of our ability to work together .
i &apos;ll have a counselor come by
and talk to you about the brochures .
oh , i see .
you &apos;re giving up on me because you don &apos;t like the way i talk .
you &apos;re just gonna let me die &apos; cause i offend you .
i am trying to give you the best care i possibly can
despite the fact that you offend me .
you are rude and demeaning ,
and i am still trying to help you move on
in the most comfortable way possible .
i am not going to move on .
i &apos;m not gonna pass away or go to heaven or make a journey home .
i am going to die .
my lungs are gonna deflate .
i &apos;m gonna lose control of my bowels .
my tongue &apos;s gonna roll to the back of my head .
i am going to be dead .
there &apos;s no making it sound nice or pretty .
it is not good . i am going to cease to exist .
and i don &apos;t want to . i am not ready .
so get off your ass and do something !
what the hell are you doing ?
he needs a pericardiocentesis .
yeah , we can &apos;t just do that .
i thought you wanted to be a rock star .
that was before you started talking about
shoving needles into hearts .
stop ! i &apos;m calling someone .
not yet .
shane !
not yet .
this is really very sweet of you .
but you know , you don &apos;t have to--
you don &apos;t have to sit here with me .
i don &apos;t mind .
i just ...
i can &apos;t stand the way she looks at me ,
the way that everyone looks at me .
uh , no one &apos;s looking at you .
please .
i grew up gay .
i know what it feels like when people are staring .
you &apos;re missing a leg , and they stare .
and everyone knows you &apos;re a cheater , and they stare .
and they talk , and they judge , and they ... stare .
like that .
what ?
c @-@ come on now , you were telling a story .
i know--
i know how you must feel about me .
and i know you try and hide it ,
but i can see it on your face .
what do you think you see ?
you know ...
jesus .
oh , come on .
oh , what , to be--it &apos;s-- i @-@ i &apos;m incapable of empathy
because i go to church ? what is that about ?
i can empathize like nobody &apos;s business ,
especially with a cheater .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
i &apos;m sorry for calling you a cheater .
i am , though .
i know .
she stared at me , too .
but the way she stared ...
felt ... really , really good .
you know ?
actually , i do .
and then ... he chainsawed his leg off .
but that &apos;s not even close to the strangest thing i &apos;ve seen .
though , honestly , i &apos;m not sure that story is appropriate .
gentlemen , that story &apos;s gonna have to wait .
okay , i look forward to it .
i &apos;ve been watching you .
chatting up our donors , stealing my stories .
you &apos;re a thief .
you &apos;ve been watching me ?
who are you ?
dr. emma marling ,
maternal @-@ fetal medicine , seattle pres .
after that storm , we &apos;ve been hurting , too ...
badly .
i &apos;ve been pushing our board to throw a fund @-@ raiser for weeks ,
and i can &apos;t get any traction . so here i am ...
borrowing yours . i &apos;m not a thief .
you stole my story .
it &apos;s a good story .
i don &apos;t get this . you are here to get donations ,
and you spend all this time talking to me .
you @-@ you want me to say it ?
i mean , look at you .
impressive party .
another whiskey soda .
that &apos;s your fifth one .
who are you , my mom ?
i &apos;m not drinking . gotta stay sharp .
this is for the c.f.o. of a.e.c. interactive .
got him on the ropes .
every drink he knocks back is another &quot; zero &quot; added to the check
i collect at the end of the night .
that sounds wrong .
right and wrong don &apos;t live here , son .
this is the wild west .
this is so much fun !
it &apos;s like when we were interns--
stealing surgeries , playing dirty .
i don &apos;t really get to do that anymore .
does this look stupid ?
the kid spit up on my dress ,
and in my dress ... all over , really .
oh , for the love of god , mer .
you &apos;re making it so easy .
every night , harvey would whisper , &quot; i love you &quot; into my ear
just as i was falling asleep .
it &apos;s been ten years since , and still ,
every night , i feel like i can hear his voice .
do you ever feel like that-- like she &apos;s still with you ?
all right .
can i have your attention , please ?
oh , speech ! speech ! everybody , hush up !
oh , sorry . he &apos;s gonna talk now .
thank you . good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
i am dr. jackson avery .
and on behalf of the board of grey sloan memorial hospital ,
i just want to say , &quot; welcome . &quot;
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much .
now over the past year , we have seen many changes ,
from a change in name to a change in leadership ...
and it has all been a challenge .
but it &apos;s been a challenge that we &apos;ve all
been more than happy to accept .
thank you .
as surgeons--
wait !
was that part of it ?
i don &apos;t think so .
oh , no , no , no ! you need to stop .
you could have internal injuries or breaks .
um ... i think i &apos;m okay . see ?
i &apos;m okay . i &apos;m fine .
so , yeah , i &apos;d say there &apos;s a break .
what &apos;s the update on those paramedics , avery ?
should be here any minute .
no pulse . okay . hold still . this is gonna hurt .
ready on my count . one , two ...
three !
do you think he &apos;s watching ?
who ?
richie rich . &apos; cause we look freaking amazing right now .
cristina , gross !
edwards , someone better be dying .
i &apos;m really hoping to avoid that , dr. yang .
ross is doing a pericardial window in the e.r.
okay , when he aspirates the fluid ,
get him to the o.r. i &apos;m on my way .
go . we got this .
this way , guys .
where are you going ?
oh , back to the hospital .
some junkie with endocarditis is tamponading .
which junkie ? - there &apos;s more than one ?
it &apos;s all about forgiveness .
and that &apos;s ... that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
you--he ... he sees me for who i am .
and he accepts me for what i &apos;ve done .
but that &apos;s-- that &apos;s everything .
are we talking about matthew or jesus ?
dr. robbins ?
yes !
you paged me ...
hi .
to a closet ?
i need you to run across to the gala
and grab a bottle of champagne because
we &apos;re low .
we are low .
you want me to steal booze
from the party i wasn &apos;t invited to ?
and snacks !
screw this day .
uh , thank you , murphy .
thank you .
you think callie &apos;s ever gonna forgive me ?
probably not .
she &apos;s telling everybody at the gala that you &apos;re dead .
you know , we &apos;re about ready to roll .
hey , i &apos;m coming , too .
how are we doing on our fund @-@ raising goal ?
oh , we &apos;re not even halfway there .
well , then you &apos;ve got plenty to do here .
i &apos;m worrying about internal injuries .
make sure they rush her to c.t.
all right .
you &apos;re not coming ?
we &apos;re on maternity leave . we have a deal .
mer ,
let &apos;s go . we need all hands on deck .
let me go !
let go !
dr. webber--please !
dr. webber--
i @-@ i can take it from here .
i can take it .
let go !
i don &apos;t want this .
there &apos;s a man down the hall . he is ornery .
he &apos;s a jackass . he &apos;s dying .
and he won &apos;t stop fighting ,
even though there isn &apos;t anything i can do for him .
and then i &apos;ve got you .
you &apos;ve got a million options , and you refuse to try .
you have atelectasis .
you are in danger for pneumothorax pneumonia , r.d.s.
and meredith grey is ready to let you slip into a coma .
but i am not ! you breathe in through this ,
your lungs get stronger , you get better .
it &apos;s damn simple math .
what do you wanna do ?
this is dumb . put this on . put--
no ! no !
just--richard !
no .
richard !
get the hell ...
out !
let &apos;s take him off bypass and see how we did .
everything okay , dr. yang ?
pericardial window is a pretty risky move for an intern .
i ... i didn &apos;t have a choice .
the fluid was too thick for a pericardiocentesis .
you had a choice .
you could have called someone the minute he tamponaded ,
but you didn &apos;t .
you basically got to do a surgery in the e.r.
and now you &apos;re up here with me ,
while edwards is down in the pit .
you &apos;re a shark .
i &apos;m not ! i swear .
ross , it &apos;s a good thing .
all great surgeons are sharks .
you see what you want and do whatever it takes to get it .
like me . and never apologize .
sharks don &apos;t apologize .
monitor .
here you go .
where &apos;s that coming from ?
it &apos;s coming from inside . that means we have two options .
one--we can put him back on bypass , undo all our work ,
and find the source , or ...
two--i take a guess , throw in a u @-@ stitch
and hope i don &apos;t shred the heart in the process .
dr. ross , what do you think ?
sharks don &apos;t swim backward . only forward ... or they die .
option 2 it is . 4 @-@ 0 prolene .
here you go .
there it is .
what &apos;s supposed to happen ?
if it worked , nothing . if it didn &apos;t ...
lots .
that &apos;ll do , sharky . that &apos;ll do .
murphy , those aren &apos;t for you .
yeah , i know .
have you seen my wife ?
uh , she , uh , hopped on a rig with the paramedics .
damn it .
hey , shepherd ?
shepherd ! wilson , where the hell is karev ?
question of the night !
you know , i should be at work right now .
you know , stephanie doesn &apos;t realize how lucky she is .
she should be thanking you instead of being pissed at you .
yeah . wait , what ?
she wanted to come tonight ?
she bought a dress .
she never said anything .
of course not .
if she had to say something , it wouldn &apos;t mean as much
as if you &apos;d had the idea on your own .
oh , my god .
my head hurts so much .
it doesn &apos;t matter now .
the party died the minute
the aerialist fell on big bird .
people see a woman &apos;s tibia impale her own foot ,
it &apos;s hard to steer the conversation
in a different direction .
they &apos;re gonna be fine .
all right . there &apos;s a hospital right down ...
down the street .
you know what ? ladies and gentlemen !
folks , wait a second .
dr. bailey ?
dr. bailey , please ?
what do you need ?
i haven &apos;t played chess in a year .
i can &apos;t keep having this fight , gene .
no , i know . i just ...
the guys at the park stopped letting me play .
&apos;cause of the things i say .
i &apos;m not trying to offend you .
that &apos;s not true .
i said a couple of those things on purpose .
so ... i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t have to play the game , but please ...
i &apos;m scared .
i don &apos;t have anybody .
i don &apos;t want to be alone .
what are you doing ?
repairing a gastric rupture . it &apos;s fun .
you can &apos;t just decide to operate .
derek , you &apos;re better at charming the donors than i am .
i admit it . you can have it .
we had a deal .
you &apos;re more than welcome to come and join me .
come get a little blood on your hands .
i &apos;ll even let you hold a retractor .
all right , i &apos;m gonna change .
oh , this is really , really fun ,
and i needed fun .
me , too .
yeah .
can i try on your leg ?
you said what ?
i was cornered by the widow amos ...
who was , you know , actually a widow .
her story was so sad ,
and she took out her checkbook , and i--
ugh , i &apos;m so gross .
yeah .
i sort of get it , though .
really ?
this stuff-- it &apos;s not easy .
and cristina--she keeps pushing me to date .
god , i can &apos;t even think about that .
yeah . you really can &apos;t keep telling people that she &apos;s dead .
i know .
doctors , we have visitors .
what is he up to ?
i don &apos;t know .
okay , now if you &apos;ll notice the pins that dr. torres
is drilling into place that is the external fixation
i was telling you about .
are--are we allowed to be here ?
yes , i spoke with irina &apos;s husband .
he said that if there &apos;s one thing that she believes in ,
it &apos;s that the show must go on .
now we showed you guys a circus tonight .
but this-- this is the real show .
this is what we do here .
we are gonna get this woman back on her feet .
and then before you leave this evening ,
i would ask that you please consider
helping us get back on ours .
how much do you need ?
i usually have really good radar for this crap .
what are you talking about ?
what the hell is this ?
oh , that &apos;s not funny .
don &apos;t freaking joke like that . i don &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m just trying to do a freakin &apos; blood draw .
why ?
i think my dad &apos;s in the hospital .
i don &apos;t understand what that means .
i don &apos;t know . i can &apos;t--
i haven &apos;t seen him in 20 years .
and this guy-- some old junkie--
crashed a car , has no i.d. ,
he &apos;s ragged , wrecked .
but his voice in the e.r.--
the guy called me sinatra .
it was like somebody poured ice water down my neck .
that feeling hasn &apos;t gone away .
so this is a paternity test ?
i don &apos;t know .
no .
i thought i could live the rest of my life
and never see him again .
i don &apos;t want it to be him .
if you take the test , then you &apos;ll know for sure .
if it isn &apos;t him , then that feeling will go away .
i guess that &apos;s true .
yeah .
you know , i &apos;m actually pretty smart .
you &apos;d know that if you tried talking to me
instead of ditching me at fancy parties .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
okay .
that surgery was incredible .
i haven &apos;t felt this relaxed in months .
me either .
what ?
reminiscing .
about ?
you , me , an exam room ,
and your panties pinned to a bulletin board .
the prom .
except you didn &apos;t have blood on your suit ,
and i wasn &apos;t wearing a sweatshirt .
i think it &apos;s sexy .
now you &apos;re doing the sparkly eye thing .
i have no idea what you &apos;re talking about .
is it working ?
what-- what &apos;s this ?
you &apos;re getting a roommate .
gene , richard . richard , gene .
calm down , dick .
the way you look , can &apos;t imagine
you &apos;re gonna be around much longer anyway .
these are a few options for facilities
that assist with end of life care .
since you two are in the same boat ,
figured you could go through them together .
crack a window when you go .
smells like something died in here .
jake &apos;s in the i.c.u. should pull through .
how are things down here ?
you know ...
only amazing .
i cannot believe i was in such a snit
over not going to a stupid party .
i mean , i have done burr holes , a crike ,
and i pulled a hunk of glass this big
out of a dude &apos;s face !
you were totally right . i am a rock star .
you are a rock star . we are rock stars .
we &apos;re not rock stars . we &apos;re sharks .
we &apos;re rock sharks !
okay , then .
jackson !
i heard you were here . i just wanted to ,
catch you before you leave .
here ... here i am .
i like the blue .
thank you .
there are more zeroes than fit in this little box .
let &apos;s get outta here .
to ... where ?
come on . don &apos;t be coy .
you like me .
there &apos;s no way this was all about the money .
no , it was all about the money .
you flirt with me all night ,
get me to write this big check ,
and then nothing ?
yeah .
and you don &apos;t feel even a little bit bad about that ?
no .
that &apos;s actually even hotter .
you have a good night .
it doesn &apos;t have to be all about money .
you could sleep with me for free .
i have to talk to you .
i don &apos;t know what happened.i just ...
stop .
i &apos;ve been here too many times , honestly .
i &apos;m too old . i &apos;m too busy to be playing games with you .
i &apos;m not playing games .
you &apos;re pissed because i didn &apos;t invite you to this stupid thing ,
and now you &apos;re getting back at me with ross .
that &apos;s not true .
oh , you &apos;re not pissed at me ?
yes ! i was .
yeah , i was , okay ?
you threw a party , and you didn &apos;t invite me .
so yeah , my feelings were hurt a little bit .
but that has nothing to do with what happened in the e.r.
ross kissed me .
i don &apos;t know where it came from .
i did not ask for it .
i swear .
fine .
fine ?
yeah ... fine .
and this wasn &apos;t a party . this was work .
nobody wanted to come . i never thought you did .
if you and i are gonna do this ,
you &apos;ve gotta start talking to me .
no more getting mad
and then waiting to see if i know you &apos;re mad
or any of that .
yeah , okay .
i didn &apos;t want him to kiss me .
i want you to kiss me .
look at this .
they got a picture of a damned rabbit
hopping through a meadow .
sunshine and daisies
and friggin &apos; bunny rabbits .
could be worse .
you could die in that bed ...
in this room .
this hospital could be the last place you see .
you don &apos;t want to die here .
no . i don &apos;t .
it is a pretty lawn .
if i gotta kick ,
could be nice to do it outside .
the food &apos;s gotta be better than what they serve here .
i wouldn &apos;t feed that slop to a gypsy .
i said &quot; i wouldn &apos;t . &quot; i was being nice .
are--are you gonna head back up the street ?
uh , no , i was just heading home .
listen , i don &apos;t blame you for not wanting
to get out there and date . people are ...
gross .
but we look great . so you wanna go hit joe &apos;s ?
oh , sorry , am i interrupting ?
you &apos;re here ?
yeah , i ...
uh , really , uh ,
had a good excuse all worked up ,
and now i &apos;m completely blanking .
i was just heading home .
it was really nice to meet you .
you , too .
good night .
overture , curtain , lights .
i have the results .
this is it ...
the night of nights .
i don &apos;t wanna know--
he &apos;s your dad .
what ?
oh , my god . i jumped the gun .
i am sorry . i am so sorry .
alex !
shotgun ! i get car sick in the back .
ugh , i might get car sick in the front .
thank you .
i &apos;m about to take my intern exam ,
which means i am about to be a second @-@ year resident .
my babysitting days are done .
and i would appreciate , if moving forward ,
you would treat me with the respect that entails .
you &apos;re adorable .
excuse me .
no more rehearsing and nursing a part .
we know every part by heart .
ross , what &apos;s going on ?
multi @-@ car mash @-@ up in the e.r.
be a shame to wake the kids .
tonight , what heights we &apos;ll hit .
on with the show .
this is it .
