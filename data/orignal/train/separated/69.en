Again, I want to thank you for your service.
My assistant will validate your parking.
I'm sending these infractions of Mr. Gardner's
to thearar association.
If you won't pursue him, they will.
Do what you gotta do.
Now get out of my office.
It's over.
It is.
Get used to it.
Diane, Viola Walsh on line one.
Yeah. Be right there.
Syria?
Yeah, we go to court tomorrow.
My guess, an eleventh-hour offer.
Oh, and, Will, Cary Agos for you.
Oh. There it is.
The official word.
Or he wants to indict me again.
Hey, Cary, how you doing?
Ah, I'm okay.
I think you know why I'm calling.
I hope I know why you're calling.
You're safe.
No indictment, and we're not coming after you again.
Thanks.
No. No, you guys, you played this smart.
Go celebrate.
Thanks, man.
You have 23 calls.
All congratulations.
Six judges among them, and Lionel Deerfield.
He said it was important you call him tonight,
It's an emergency.
Yep.
I think I can do without lionel Deerfield's good cheer tonight.
They're on their way in now.
No, we're setting things up now.
Okay. Thanks, Alicia. See you in a minute.
I want in.
I handed it off when I thought I was going to jail.
I'm not going to jail.
You had a brush with death, my friend.
Take a week.
No, the adrenaline's pumping.
I'm ready to take someone down.
Okay, then.
Let's take 'em down.
I'm so glad, Will, realy.
I am, too. Thank you.
So, anyway, they're going to be here
in a few minutes for negotiations.
Can you greet them?
Sure.
Viola Walsh.
Yeah. Why?
Last time she was here,
she asked me to join her firm.
Really?
Maybe you could use that.
Ms. Walsh. Mr. Gross.
Yes, and you're...?
Alicia. Florrick.
Oh. Yes, right.
So, this is where creativity goes to die.
Oh, no, that's the next floor.
Is that supposed to be funny?
It-it is.
Well, I didn't think it was funny.
Must've been my delivery.
This way, please.
Dianane!
William.
My two favorite people.
Viola. Always a pleasure.
And Neil Gross, in his patented hoodie.
I'm just waiting to get my blood sucked.
We seem to be catching you in the middle of a party.
Casual Wednesdays.
Wow.
Look at these wonderful exhibits.
Well, you just seem to be girding yourself for battle, aren't you?
Hello.
Oh, this is Caitlin. She's sitting-in.
Can we start?
Mr. Gross, hello.
You created a suite of software...
Oh, excuse me.
We don't need to review the case.
Oh, this isn't a review.
This is my opening argument.
Oh. You created a suite of decryption software
entitled CoursePoint.
It's not decryption software.
It's data-mining.
And your company sold it to the Syrian government.
We would deny that. And the Syrian electronic army
Used this software to decrypt and obstruct
private e-mails and chats in order to
arre, , torture, and murder protestors.
we represent the three American proteststor
and we are asking that their family be awarded
$1 mililon dollors for damages
UhUh.. and 6 million for paining suffering.
Maybe my taste for hypocrisy is at an all-time low.
Discussing dissidents while
party music's playing in the next room...
Can we just get to the core of the problem?
You don't care about these protestors.
You care about your top client, Patric Edelstein.
Oops.
He's battling me for control
of the international software market.
This is just one more attempt
to embarrass me in order to make way for him.
It's death by a thousand paper cuts.
This is one paper cut.
Yes. We represent your chief competitor.
But no, this is not about paper cuts.
This is about the families of Mohammed Hazouri,
Amy Newton, and Sara Fellner.
Okay. All good to know.
But here's our offer. Are you ready?
$100,000 and an endowed scholarship to advance the causes
exemplified by these fine youths,
and a joint statement of agreement
saying that we will more strictly supervise
third-party sales of our software.
That's why you brought us in here?
M-May I speak to you for a moment, please?
Caitlin...
I know you thought you were being helpful in there,
but you really shouldn't talk.
Will asked me to.
He... What?
Will asked me to say that, no matter what their offer was.
Uh, how close are we, Samir?
Uh, why? Is there somewhere else you need to be?
Yeah.
You know, it's tough getting cross town.
You need to come to Syria, Kalinda. You live in boredom.
Our days are filled with excitement.
You make it sound very tempting.
Two protestors dead in Damascus today.
Yes, I know. I...
I should have confirmation on the middleman in three minutes.
You keeping yourself safe there?
Oh, yes. I have friends in the Mukhabarat, the Shabeeha,
and the protestors.
I have, uh, covered my bases well.
Oh, I saw, uh, Barbara Walters yesterday.
Really?
Yes, uh, she was here to interview our president.
She had, um... much better hair
than I thought.
Uh, excuse me, Samir.
Yes, Eli?
Did you talk to Stacie Hall?
It's not a good time.
No. I need to know now.
Did you talk to Stacie Hall about my ex-wife?
Can we discuss this later? I'm on with Syria.
No. Kalinda, I want...
right now.
What's the emergency, Eli?
Why?
Why what?
Why did my ex-wife hire Stacie Hall as a campaign strategist
for her upcoming State Senate campaign?
Why does my ex-husband care?
I care because she is my competition,
and she has poached three of my clients!
So she's good?
Vanessa! She is out destabilize me,
and that is why she's offering to represent you.
Oh, really? My mistake.
I thought my campaign was about me,
but of course it's about you.
This is not narcissism, Vanessa.
It's strategy.
Eli, you turned me down.
I asked you to consult on my campaign...
Which I did.
until we got into one of our postmarital spats,
and we decided not to work together.
So I sought out Stacie, that's all.
She didn't seek me out.
Eli's mind is at work.
I get it.
I get it. This is to try and get me back on your campaign.
Oh, my God.
You're telling me it's just a coincidence
that you pursued my competitor?
I'm not telling you anything.
It makes sense. You have your Bin Laden problem...
I didn't know he was a Bin Laden!
And if I'm on your staff, it looks better.
"See? Her husband doesn't mind
that she slept with a Bin Laden." Okay. Thanks for this.
Whenever I feel nostalgic about our time together, Eli,
you always toss me one of these bracing little tête-à-tête.
Okay, okay, wait, wait.
Don't go with the green border.
Why? It's about the environment.
Voters don't think "nature" when they see green.
They think "bad skin." Look at the McCain campaign.
And that is not your best side.
You know. You need warmer lighting.
Gold is good for you.
Stacie thought gold was too on-the-nose.
Oh, geez! On-the-nose is good.
You're not trying to win the Nobel.
Okay.
Thanks, Eli.
Do you really get nostalgic about our time together?
Good night, Eli.
Here's your problem.
To win, you need to prove two things:
One, that my client knowingly sold the software to Syria--
a high bar in itself-- and two,
that he knew that the software would be used to
capture and kill protestors.
Good luck with that.
You-you got the invoice in your hand?
Yes. It was, uh, routed through, uh, Dubai.
Thanks, Samir. I'll be in touch, okay?
No, no. I will be in touch with you.
Okay? Just send me an e-mail with three question marks,
and I will call you. Okay?
It's... safer, that way.
Okay, good...
Stay safe, my friend.
And as kind as your financial offer is,
we'll take our chances in court.
Don't you want to check with your clients first?
They've given us permission to reject any unreasonable amount.
Well, you're not going to get any more.
I'll make it my life's mission
to get more.
That was odd.
What was?
The offer was too lowball.
It's like they're challenging us to take it to court.
Hello, Lionel.
I would've called, but it's been crazy here.
Hello, Will.
Can we go someplace private?
Sure.
This way.
Things seem to be falling apart here.
So what's the emergency?
Have you talked to anybody at the bar?
At the bar? What bar?
The bar's Attorney Compliance and Disciplinary Board.
Oh. No. Why?
We're pursuing your disbarment.
Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm on the review panel.
Look, I know I shouldn't be saying anything,
I've been sworn to confidentiality, but...
we received anonymous charges that you took
$45,000 from a client's account.
And put it back. 15 years ago.
There's no statute of limitations with disbarment.
We start disciplinary proceedings tomorrow.
I'm sorry, I just...
I thought you should know.
Don't say I said anything.
Before we begin,
I want to take a few minutes to talk about something
that is happening a mere 100 yards from this courthouse:
Occupy Wall Street!
Yes, these amazing young men and women are braving
36-degree weather,
with the grit in their eyes of a shared cause,
and all to challenge the system.
And I, for one, I...
I salute them.
Well, that's all right. That's all I want to say.
And with that, we should get started, so...
Do you want me to take the first witness?
No, I'm good.
And that's you?
Yes.
And you and your sister were in Syria why?
We were studying Arabic at the Al-Baath University in Homs.
And who is this?
My sister... Sara.
She told me to take the camera.
She wanted the video to get out.
And then what happened?
The officers took us into custody.
Saydnaya Prison in Homs.
And the al-Mukhabarat al-'Askariyya...
That's military intelligence?
Yes.
They had a transcript of a cell call
I had with Sara a week earlier,
and he kept repeating it.
And that's why you were arrested?
Yes. We discussed joining the protest on the call.
Do you have any idea how they intercepted this call?
Yes. There was a PC in the interrogation room,
and he kept reading it from the screen.
But what does that have to do with Mr. Gross's company?
Couldn't that have been any software?
No. When they took me to my cell,
I saw the logo on the screen.
It was the chess piece logo from Chumhum.
And that was the last time you saw Sara alive?
Yes. When the guards looked through her passport,
they saw a stamp for Israel.
We had gone a year before,
but my stamp was too faint to see,
so they let me go, and they kept her.
You were demonstrating peacefully, Jimmy?
You and Sara?
Yes.
Much like Occupy Wall Street...
Oh, come on.
Objection, Your Honor.
Your Honor, I am merely showing the victim's intentions.
No, you're merely playing into His Honor's stated sympathy.
Okay, thank you, both of you.
I think you'll find that I'm made of sterner stuff,
Mr. Gardner, Ms...?
Walsh.
Walsh,
than to have my sympathies so easily plucked.
So, any further questions?
No, Your Honor.
Mr. Fellner, you know that Chumhum has
many software products that use the same logo?
Yes.
Business software, word processors, spreadsheets,
and all are designated to use the same chess piece logo?
Yes.
So couldn't it have been one
of Mr. Gross's other software products,
say, his word processing software,
for example, that yousaw on the screen that you mentioned?
No.
But you aren't certain?
All the software has different colored chess pieces.
This chess piece was red.
Just so we're clear, Your Honor,
red is the color of the logo...
Objection, Your Honor.
Do we all get to testify into the record now?
Okay, we're going to be making some changes around here,
shuffling a few people around.
Is this about the failed grand jury?
No, this is about a lot of things, not just any one thing.
Some of us weren't consulted on
that judicial bribery investigation.
We're not gonna finger-point around here.
No one's to blame, and everyone's to blame.
So I will be visiting with you each individually
to discuss new priorities, all right? Thank you very much.
Too bad that didn't work out for you.
Go to hell.
I heard you did well in court today.
I did.
And yet...
The Attorney Compliance and Disciplinary Board
is pursuing my disbarment.
Uh... Why?
The $45,000 I borrowed 15 years ago.
No statute of limitations.
My guess is Wendy slipped the charges to them as a late hit.
We have to fight it.
Fight what?
I did it.
It was a long time ago, but I did it.
Yes. And we have to point out their hypocrisy in pursuing you.
One thing I've noticed, people in judgment
don't care about their hypocrisy.
Then you throw yourself at the mercy of the board.
It never ends, does it?
Once they have you in their grasp...
...they never let go.
Eli.
Diane.
Why are you doing it?
Nora! There is someone in my office!
Why are you undercutting me with your wife?
Ex-wife.
You can't just come in here. You call ahead.
Well, you left one of your socks last night.
I needed to return it.
I did not. That is not my sock. What am I, Santa?
Oh, it's mine.
What's wrong with green? There's nothing wrong with green.
For trees and split pea soup, nothing.
But for campaign brochures...
This is not Campaign 101.
Then stop undercutting me with your wife.
Then do a better job.
Well, your ex-clients seem to think I'm doing a better job.
Okay. You got me there. Good-bye.
I need to see you again.
No.
Last night was amazing.
I can still taste you this morning.
Oh, okay. Thank you. G... Good-bye.
At least 75 people are reported dead in Syria
in one of the bloodiest days since the uprising began.
The violence comes a day after 41 people were killed,
including five women...
Hi, remember me? Stacie Hall.
Yeah. How are you?
Good. I have a quick question.
Okay.
How did you find out she slept with bin Laden?
Why don't we discuss this somewhere else?
Not that bin Laden. Not Osama.
Patric Edelstein wants an update.
The conference room.
What?
So we are doing this for Edelstein?
Conference room.
The class rejected the offer of a scholarship
of $100,000 and a joint statement.
And so now we're at trial.
And what are our chances?
Fifty-fifty.
But our intent is to use the trial
to apply further pressure to Neil Gross
and get a more lucrative settlement.
So I have to ask something of you.
Okay.
I need you to settle.
We'd rather not have Congress look into
our foreign sales of decryption software.
I would imagine that would work for you,
having Congress look into Neil Gross.
No. Unfortunately, on this point,
Neil Gross's interests and my interests are aligned.
Congress will turn this into a circus.
This trial is giving it more prominence.
We don't represent you in this case.
We represent the class,
the three families of the dead protesters.
Yes, but I referred them to you.
I understand that.
But when we agreed to take their case,
they became our clients, not you.
I'm sorry.
This isn't...
...really what I wanted.
I'm sorry.
We can't help you here.
Are we going to be all right here?
I don't know. He may leave.
That's the breaks.
Mr. Deerfield, do you have a minute?
Yes. Uh...
Diane Lockhart, right?
Yes. I'd like to talk to you about Will Gardner.
My name is Kassim Al-Khoury.
I'm a software wholesaler, working out of Dubai.
And you've had dealings with Mr. Gross's company?
Yes. We admire you greatly, Mr. Gross.
I've read your biography three times.
And where did you have dealings with Mr. Gross's company?
In Dubai, at the yearly technology trade show.
The trade show colloquially referred to as
"The Wiretapper's Ball"?
Yes. Various Western companies sell their wares there.
And many totalitarian governments shop there
for spy tech and data-mining software?
Yes. But also corporations who want to encourage
employee productivity.
Also law enforcement...
Oh, sorry.
Please continue.
We can take a break, Your Honor.
No, no, no, no. No, it's nothing.
Over lunch, I went to offer moral support to Occupy Wall Street.
And it's because of the pepper spray.
At the Wiretapper's Ball,
you bought some of Mr. Gross's CoursePoint software?
Yes.
And you sold it to representatives of Syria?
Yes.
And this was because Chumhum itself
couldn't sell software to the Syrians?
Yes, the American trade embargo required using a middleman.
That is me.
And this is, in fact, your invoice,
selling CoursePoint to the Syrians?
Yes, it is.
And did Chumhum know you were reselling software to Syria?
Oh, yes. I sent the invoices to them as well.
No further questions.
I, um, Ms. Walsh,
do you have any questions?
Yes, Your Honor.
You hold a grudge against Mr. Gross's firm, don't you?
No. What do you mean?
I mean,
that you sued Mr. Gross for nonpayment of debt.
No. We had a disagreement
over Euro-to-dollar conversions.
Well, didn't Mr. Gross's company refuse to pay you
precisely because you were selling
spy software to Middle Eastern regimes?
No, that is not true.
No further questions, Your Honor,
but we would like to recall Jimmy Fellner.
Why are you suing, Jimmy?
Because my sister's dead, and she doesn't have to be.
Sorry.
Ignore me.
And that's why everyone in this class action is suing, right?
Yes.
That's your sister?
Yes.
And who's this?
It looks like my sister,
but I've never seen that photo before.
But it would appear to be your sister.
Yes, where was it taken?
We just got this photo from a Syrian rebellion Web site.
It was taken three days ago.
Objection, Your Honor.
Why would you object?
We've just given your client good news.
His sister is alive.
We have no way to confirm the providence of this.
Oh, my God. Jimmy,
you yourself said that you're suing
because your sister is dead.
Well, this is evidence that she's alive.
Mr. Will Gardner,
one of the objectives of the State Bar Disciplinary Board
is to maintain the honor and integrity
of the practice of the law
and to promote the general welfare of the members thereof.
To this purpose, we have collected sufficient evidence
regarding the theft of $45,000 we believe
warrants disbarment proceedings.
Do you understand?
Yes.
In all matters,
this board attempts to show deference
to any calls for leniency.
It has come to our attention
that you have been responsible for the establishment
of the pro bono department in your firm.
At a time when most firms
are curtailing their pro bono efforts,
it is heartening to see that Lockhart & Gardner
is stepping those efforts up, at your direction.
For this reason,
we would like to offer you the option of suspension.
Six months probation.
No cases, no clients,
no entering a courtroom except as a private citizen.
And if I decline?
Then we proceed to a disbarment hearing.
And the determination of this panel
will be permanent.
We have to;
we have to drop the suit.
That's exactly what the other side wants.
I don't want anything out there
that could jeopardize my sister's life.
You're being irrational.
What if it were Amy?
You'd still be thinking about monetary damages?
If we walk away, this company goes about its business,
and who's to say there's not another Amy or Sara
in the future?
That's exactly right.
Which is why...
The majority of the class rules.
Yes, but we put Kalinda on finding out more about Sara.
Good, I'm on it.
You talked to the board?
What did they say?
Six months suspension.
How long do you have?
They need a decision tomorrow.
Fight it, Will.
Six months away from the law will kill you.
The photo of Sara was on the Web site
of a blogger who goes by Pink Damascus.
A lesbian activist chronicling the protests in Syria.
She's been a huge thorn in the side of the Assad regime.
Can you find her?
If we know who took the picture, we can find Sara.
I have some ideas.
Caitlin?
Has Viola asked you to join her firm?
Yes.
I said no.
Yes, just so you know,
other firms will try to distract you
by asking you to join them.
It means nothing.
They never trust you if they poach you.
It's best to stay loyal.
I wasn't taking it seriously.
I know.
Am I doing well here?
You are.
Very well.
Good.
Thank you.
This is first-rate idiocy!
Is that why you brought us in here, Eli, to insult me?
You slept with a Bin Laden,
you can't just ignore that.
How do you know we're ignoring it?
You grilled Kalinda on how she figured it out.
You can't just close off those channels.
Hm, you're right, Vanessa.
His left vein in his temple pulsates
when he gets angry.
It won't work.
If Kalinda figured it out,
it's only a matter of time before it becomes public.
So, what's your suggestion?
Own it.
Be the one to bring it forward.
Cloak it in open-mindedness.
Pushing back against anti-Islamic prejudices.
It's only a name.
Our president had the same middle name
as a genocidal dictator, and we still elected him.
This guy, your, um, hotel financier,
the one you slept with while we were married...
Eli.
What?
I'm being just as accurate as the press will be.
You know, this is getting messy, maybe I should just back off.
No, Stacie, give us a minute.
Sure. Oh, there my sock is.
So, who are you obsessed with, her or me?
No one.
I'm just helping.
I don't like her hurting you.
Okay, do me a favor.
Either stop caring
or officially get on board.
So, Cary, how's it hanging?
I need you to take a step back from court
and do some child support enforcement.
You need me to?
Yeah.
We were both on that judicial bribery investigation.
It wasn't just me.
This is what Peter needs.
So it's Peter, not you.
It's what the office needs.
And you're just gonna go along with it. Right?
You knew I was following Wendy Scott-Carr's orders,
but you don't give a damn.
Dana...
No.
You don't get to say it like that.
No, Mr. Agos, you don't.
It won't be very long...
Good-bye.
What does that mean?
Yes, I see the photo of Sara,
but I cannot help.
It could have been taken anywhere in Syria.
And what about the blog where it surfaced?
Can you... can you help us find Pink Damascus?
Samir?
Are you there?
Samir?
I cannot stay here long.
I understand.
Uh, yes, yes,
we know this Web site.
No one really knows where this Pink Damascus is.
If you learn a neighborhood, I will keep trying.
I have to go.
I can't help.
That's not technically true.
I thought I was getting an update from Will Gardner.
Pink Damascus has a Sleuthway account, sir,
and if we could just contact her...
Our privacy policy is the cornerstone of my company.
If it got out that I released a user's confidential informa...
Better than if it got out that you prioritized
company policy over the life of a 23-year-old girl.
Yeah?
Can I help you?
I'm sorry.
I think I got the wrong person.
Who did you think I was?
A lesbian blogger from Syria.
Pink Damascus?
Sorry to disappoint.
Have you heard of her?
Yeah, you know, I keep up with the news.
Yeah, imagine the public uproar
if it were revealed that Pink Damascus is actually
a 30-something-year-old guy living in Kansas,
pretending.
Where'd you come up with Kansas?
Your Rock Chalk pillow, the KU cheer.
You know, you could face felony fraud charges.
That's five to eight years in federal prison.
You're lying.
I work for a law firm.
Try me.
What do you want?
He only had an IP address for the person who sent him the photo.
"He"?
Yeah, imagine that.
Misrepresenting himself on the Internet.
I traced the IP address to Homs.
An Internet cafe in the Al-Sinaa district.
Good, you'll pass this on to your contact in Syria?
Yeah.
You wanted to discuss the Neil Gross questioning?
Yeah.
No.
You...
want me to...
No, stay.
Close the door a second.
I didn't tell you about the grand jury investigation before,
and that was a mistake.
And you're safe.
Yes.
I mean, it's moved to a possible disbarment,
and I've been given a choice.
Wait, what?
The Disciplinary Board is looking into disbarring me.
Oh, my God.
Will...
It's okay.
It's just... I'm used to it now.
Funny.
Anyway, I've been given a choice.
Fight disbarment or take a six-month suspension.
You can't; you don't deserve to be disbarred.
I do deserve to be disbarred.
I took money from a client's account.
15 years ago.
But I did it.
And you know what?
The only reason I'm being offered leniency
is because of our...
It's because of our pro bono program.
Something I fought tooth and nail.
You didn't.
I did.
I'm taking the six month suspension.
I did wrong. I should face the consequences.
There it is.
I've just decided, thank you.
You're giving up the law for six months?
Yeah.
Weird, huh?
I can't imagine it.
You did for over a decade.
Yes.
Ok.
I better tell someone.
Okay, then you'll close out the Neil Gross case,
and I'll reassign your other cases to the partners.
How soon can you get me a rundown?
End of the day.
Good.
You won't be able to come into the office
unless it's related to handing off cases or the business of the firm.
I'll file the papers with the bar
about the firm's name change.
Lockhart & Associates seems simplest.
Unless you have any objections.
So, we're done.
For now.
You'll still have a place when you come back.
Technology doesn't take sides.
Is that how you rationalize doing business with autocratic regimes?
Objection. Argumentative.
Yes, sustained.
Mr. Gross,
does your company sell to the governments of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain?
You mean, allies of the United States with whom we have
full diplomatic and trade relations?
Yes, we do.
We never discussed this line of questioning.
Your social networking Web site, Chumhum--
did you not turn over the addresses
of Chinese dissidents to the Beijing...?
Objection. Relevance.
Mr. Gross's lack of compunction in dealing with regimes
that torture and kill their own people,
not to mention Amy Newton,
Sara Fellner, Mohammed Hazouri...
Your Honor, I understand where your sympathies lie...
Ms. Walsh, stop that, please.
I know you're trying to drive a theme to help you
in your appeal, but don't do it at my expense.
Your Honor, I wasn't.
You were, ma'am.
And I don't mean to fly off the handle here,
but I am being objective.
So, objection... sustained.
Let's talk about CoursePoint, Mr. Gross.
It emits a ping to your central servers
when it's in use, does it not?
Kind of a homing signal?
Again, relevance. If Mr. Gardner is so curious
about the nuts and bolts of our program,
I recommend that he go
to the software convention in Las Vegas next month.
Regardless of how the program was obtained, Your Honor,
how the program operates is precisely what attracts it to users.
Your logic is... logical.
Your objection is overruled, Ms. Walsh.
Uh, yes.
When the software is in use,
it interfaces with our server.
So you are able to identify when and where
CoursePoint is active?
Yes, we are.
Well, then wouldn't it follow that you had full knowledge
that your product was being used by the Syrian government?
I've never denied that.
But as I have maintained, repeatedly,
neither I nor my company provided it to them.
Can you tell if those pings
were being sent from the city of Homs?
Objection. Beyond irrelevant.
If you wanted to, Mr. Gross, you could tell where
my client's sister was being held right now.
That doesn't even make sense!
It does if she's being held in the same place
Mr. Gross's program is being used!
Objection, Your Honor!
And I sustain Ms. Walsh's objections.
Mostly good cross.
Thank you.
You tried to take Neil Gross out at the knees.
Only because no one else has.
Be smart, Will.
Don't argue from passion-- it clouds your thinking.
You think I've forgotten about the case?
That I'm suddenly hell-bent on finding Sara?
I think you're trying to hit a home run
with your last at bat.
It's just an observation.
I'd love nothing more than to be proven wrong.
I don't have much time to prove anything.
Yes.
Is that a yes-yes,
or an I-really-don't-want-to-
but-my-ex-wife-has- worn-me-down yes?
Does it make any difference?
Yes, I will consult on your campaign.
And yes, I will even take my marching orders from Stacie.
Eli, I don't want you if you don't want to.
Okay, okay, okay, first lesson about being
an elected official: when you get what you want...
shut up!
What?
I miss arguing with you.
Well, I'm sure we'll now have plenty of opportunities
to relive those glorious moments.
I'll send over the latest budget.
You've always been good about finding the fat.
And I have some position papers I'd like you to mark up.
Mm-hmm. Well, you know where to find me.
Win or lose, this'll be nice.
Diane, you needed something?
Oh, yes.
Will talked to you about his decision?
He did.
Good. I'm reassigning his cases.
I need you to take this one solo.
Will and I would like to keep it under the radar.
Who's the client?
Kalinda.
It's primarily a tax case.
Kalinda has a variety of complications,
some business, some personal.
Several of which began before she joined the firm.
I appreciate your confidence,
but I would think a tax lawyer might be more qualified.
It's past what a tax lawyer can do,
which is why I was handling it,
and why we want you to take over.
You and Kalinda should talk as soon as possible.
They are holding her in an empty...
Al-Sinaa district.
Samir, you cut out. Can you please repeat again?
They are holding her in an empty school in the Al-Sinaa district.
They use these abandoned buildings
instead of prisons to hold people.
It makes it a lot harder to find someone you are looking for.
And you're absolutely sure she's there?
As sure as it is possible.
I might be able to get her out,
but I will need 50,000 U.S. dollars.
To pay a bribe?
I will handle it, okay?
But there's just about four hours,
so I need the money immediately.
We'll wire it.
Samir, tell us where to wire it.
Okay, you want to wire it
...central bank...
Did you get that?
Samir?
Hello?
I know how we're going to win this case.
How?
Tech support.
Dinesh Rekhi.
I work on the Chumhum help desk.
But to my customers, I'm Roger.
Have you received calls from users
seeking help with CoursePoint?
Yes. It's a complex program, and there's still
a bug or two to be worked out. Sorry, Mr. Gross,
but all programs have bugs.
And how many calls have you received since March 2011,
when the Syrian uprising began?
Hundreds.
Did any of those calls come
from customers in Syria?
Yes.
And who were those customers?
Government users from the Ministry of the Interior.
The agency that oversees Syrian security forces?
I don't know. I just answer the phones.
How can you know for certain who's calling?
Every user who calls must identify their license number.
It's part of the user agreement.
So Syrian government agencies bought the software
and registered it, just like any other honest user?
It appears so.
But they couldn't use it without your help.
Yes.
So, Chumhum is helping the Syrian government arrest
and torture protesters.
Your Honor, I'd like to request a recess
to confer with plaintiff counsel.
Harmony and concord between the two sides.
I'm inspired.
They have her.
Sara?
Greetings from Ramstein Air Base.
It's my first trip to Germany.
You look like hell.
You look perfect.
Samir?
Hello?
Salaam alaikum.
Is Samir available?
No.
He's not here.
I just wanted to let him know that...
I said he's not here.
Do you know when he might be back?
Samir is gone.
I-I'm sorry.
We cannot talk anymore.
Do not call again.
At least four people have been killed after army troops
stormed the town of Talkalakh in western Syria.
According to residents, the town is under lockdown
with government security...
Burning the midnight oil even on your last day?
I thought I could squeeze out one last billable hour.
Any idea what you're gonna do?
Maybe write a rock opera?
There hasn't been a decent one since The Wall.
I'm sure it'll be great.
I don't think Pink Floyd has anything to worry about.
Will, if there's anything you need...
I'm good.
But thanks.
Follow Diane's lead, Alicia.
