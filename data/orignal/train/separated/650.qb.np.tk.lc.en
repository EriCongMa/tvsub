第一季 第五集
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
amanda !
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died , he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people
who destroyed our lives .
i &apos;m lydia davis ...
we met briefly on the beach .
at the southfork inn .
you could have had anyone ,
and you knew she was my closest friend .
frank , would you please talk to these men ?
ah , so you &apos;re mr. grayson ?
no .
i work for him .
did i just hear emily ?
she said she had to cancel dinner .
in revenge , as in life ,
every action has an equal and opposite reaction .
in the end , the guilty always fall .
thank you for standing guard last night , frank .
were you able to sleep ?
not much .
any leads as to who abducted dr. banks ?
as of this morning , she was still unable
or unwilling to identify her attacker .
victoria , don &apos;t worry .
i won &apos;t let anything happen to you .
conrad &apos;s flying home this morning .
no , he &apos;s not .
his jet never left the hangar .
he spent the night in the city .
with lydia ?
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a transfer receipt from conrad &apos;s account
in the caymans to lydia .
it &apos;s for $ 10 million .
i thought you should know .
good morning .
hey . wow , ash . that dress is criminal .
thank you . it &apos;s my dress @-@ to @-@ impress outfit .
i &apos;m hoping victoria pays more attention to it
than the disaster i made of her mother @-@ daughter tea .
those patient recordings had nothing to do with you .
she has to know that .
mm . what the queen does and does not know is a complete mystery
to everyone but her and that creepy security goon frank .
oddly enough , they asked me more questions
about your potential involvement than mine .
my involvement ?
because that &apos;s exactly what i want--
my most embarrassing confessions about her son
broadcast for all to see .
like i said , ridiculous .
speaking of daniel ,
looks like he &apos;s back to his old ways .
he came home absolutely wankered last night .
tyler had to practically carry him in .
how noble .
anyway , it &apos;s safe to say that victoria &apos;s week
is off to a monumentally rotten start .
any ideas on how to thaw the ice queen ?
hmm . well , victoria relishes her status
as queen bee , right ?
pathologically .
find an opportunity to get her back in the spotlight .
what events does she have coming up ?
this week , the open arms charity gala .
mm . me , too .
see if you can get them
to honor victoria for her tireless efforts .
you &apos;re a genius .
i &apos;m gonna see you at victoria &apos;s luncheon today , right ?
of course .
okay , bye .
bye .
officials had confirmed 246 passengers fatalities
in the bombing of the jumbo jet ,
but the final death toll will likely surge
to include many unaccounted @-@ for persons on the ground .
a homegrown group of violent radicals
calling themselves americon initiative
is claiming responsibility for the attack .
hey , kiddo .
if i had known you were gonna get up early ,
woulda had you come swim with sammy and me .
there was a plane crash , daddy .
... disaster vowed , quote
&quot; to root out the murdering cowards
and bring them to swift justice . &quot;
&quot; conrad and victoria knew
the victims &apos; families would need a devil
to shoulder the blame for the money
that conrad had been laundering for the terrorists .
they chose me as the patsy
while passing themselves off as grieving benefactors .
never underestimate the power of guilt , amanda .
it compels people to some pretty remarkable places .
艾米莉 · 索恩小姐收
don &apos;t make a federal case out of it , mom .
it was a few drinks , okay ?
you staggered home like a drunken sailor .
if it weren &apos;t for tyler ,
you might not have made it home at all .
well , in daniel &apos;s defense , emily had just lied to him
and stood him up .
look , can we drop this ?
no , we can not .
you violated our agreement .
you shouldn &apos;t have been in any bar in the first place .
you been drinking again , daniel ?
intervention &apos;s over , dad . mom won .
how was your trip ?
it &apos;s gonna take an act of god to resuscitate this market .
well , if you need any extra c.p.r. at the office ,
i &apos;m happy to help . my internship ...
at stern investments just fell through .
and as usual , their loss is grayson global &apos;s gain .
when can you start ?
you tell me , sir .
get yourself dressed . you start today .
you too , daniel .
it &apos;s clear your summer could use the structure .
yes , sir .
i &apos;m gone , what , two days , and daniel &apos;s off the wagon ?
how &apos;d you let that happen ?
i had my hands full .
perhaps you can tell me where your hands have been .
what &apos;s my little girl with the infinity tattoo
up to today ?
suddenly , she &apos;s thinking of filing a restraining order .
yeah , well , isn &apos;t that the pot calling the kettle black ?
so what irons are we throwing in the fire this week ?
we are not throwing anything anywhere .
i am going for a swim .
thought you might say that .
you know , it wouldn &apos;t , uh , it wouldn &apos;t kill you
to try and be nice to me .
not part of the plan .
certainly hasn &apos;t stopped you
from cozying up to daniel grayson .
that &apos;s because he actually is part of the plan .
seems to me the best plan for him
has a minimum of 12 steps .
you know , if you really wanted to help me ,
why didn &apos;t you get your new b.f.f. jack
to cut him off ?
not my fault .
daniel &apos;s new sidekick was at the helm .
the guy was feeding him shots like a frat boy to a freshman .
tyler .
mm @-@ hmm .
that frat boy is becoming a huge problem .
he &apos;s more of an enabler than you are .
daniel doesn &apos;t seem to mind .
did you honestly think i wouldn &apos;t notice
the gaping hole where $ 10 million used to be ?
i &apos;ve seen the bank receipt .
i was trying to protect you .
the only thing you were trying to protect
is your weakness for her .
she has the power to expose us , victoria .
i didn &apos;t have a choice .
you could &apos;ve called her bluff .
after 15 years of complicity ,
i don &apos;t think lydia has it in her .
maybe not before you exiled her ,
but thanks to your handiwork ,
she no longer has anything to lose .
i &apos;d say we got away with a bargain .
it &apos;s because of your handiwork we &apos;re in this situation in the first place .
sorry , man .
i overslept .
ah , no worries .
you &apos;re burnt .
you set the whole bar up all by yourself ?
i &apos;ve seen pop do it plenty of times .
i didn &apos;t realize you were paying attention .
so remind me again
why we gotta work so hard ?
&apos;cause we decided not to sell ,
and the bar is not gonna run itself .
i know all that , but there &apos;s nothing
that says we gotta do it all by ourselves .
let &apos;s hire some help .
it &apos;s gonna cost money .
this place drove dad to his grave .
i ain &apos;t goin &apos; out like that .
lydia , hi .
how are you ? it &apos;s been a long time .
not that long .
i want my house back .
pardon me ?
this cottage is one of the few things
that still connects me to the life that i lost
the weekend that i met you .
i hand @-@ picked nearly every piece of decor in this place .
and your taste is impeccable , which is exactly
why i paid double the asking price--
to make sure it came fully furnished .
i &apos;m contesting the sale .
i was technically on the deed ,
and in spite of what you stumbled on to
between me and conrad at the southfork inn ,
my ex @-@ husband had no legal right to sell .
i &apos;m sorry for what happened to you , lydia .
and i get that you &apos;re upset , but the money from the sale
should more than compensate for your loss .
and what could a girl like you possibly know about loss ?
if you want to give me your new address ,
i &apos;d be happy to pack up a few things for you and ship them .
i &apos;m not here to get my things back .
i &apos;m here to get my life back .
and no one , least of all
a nosy troublemaker with a penchant for turning my world upside down ,
is gonna get in the way of that .
we all have our southfork inn , emily .
i just made it my mission to find yours .
莉迪亚 · 戴维斯收
so i know why i got roped into interning at the death star ,
but why the hell would you want to ruin your summer ,
working for my dad ?
are you kidding ?
grayson global is one of the largest wealth managers on wall street .
thanks for loaning me the suit , by the way .
not too shabby .
you wear it well .
oh , there &apos;s my damn phone .
now if i could just find my credit card .
oh , i think you left it at the blowaway .
is that place for real ?
ty , another night like last night ,
and i &apos;ll be spending the summer at one of your parents &apos; houses ,
which doesn &apos;t sound half bad , actually .
all you did was let off a little steam .
don &apos;t let your parents make it a bigger deal than it was .
besides , the tension around here
isn &apos;t about you anyway .
sounds like your mom &apos;s just still pissed
about that woman your dad slept it .
come again ?
lydia something .
you didn &apos;t know ?
danny ...
missed you at breakfast .
not hungry .
charlotte ... we &apos;re going to have to
discuss our communication problems at some point .
and rather than dwelling on the past ,
i think the remedy for us
would be to find some common ground .
start spending some quality time together .
what &apos;d you have in mind ?
well ... for starters ,
i thought it might be fun if you joined me and the ladies
for my weekly luncheon .
you &apos;re unbelievable , you know that ?
the only reason you want to parade me in front of your lady puppets
is to prove i &apos;ve forgiven you .
exactly how many more times do i have to apologize
before you do ?
you wished i &apos;d never been born .
do me a favor and pretend i wasn &apos;t .
excuse me .
i have a special delivery for victoria grayson .
gift from a conrad grayson .
where do i sign ?
here you go , bud .
ah . thanks , man .
captain jack .
forgot my credit card .
you coulda called .
would &apos;ve been happy to drop that in the mail for you .
i also wanted to apologize ,
face @-@ to @-@ face .
i had a bit of a bad night last night .
girl problems , you know ?
you mean those girls over by the pool table ?
looked like you were doing just fine .
right .
yeah , they were pretty friendly .
tell him i &apos;m a real people person .
uh , jack ,
you see that guy over there ?
his name &apos;s bull , and he wants the bartending gig .
scares the hell outta me .
all right . i &apos;ll handle it . i &apos;ll handle it .
sorry again about last night .
forget about it .
emily .
i &apos;m so happy you &apos;ve decided to join our weekly lunch .
ashley has continually alerted me
of your interest in all my causes .
it &apos;s a wonder we haven &apos;t crossed paths before .
listen , i &apos;m so sorry
about you and daniel , dear .
the way he &apos;s been behaving lately ,
perhaps it &apos;s for the best .
thank you so much for coming today , ladies .
saturday &apos;s benefit for open arms
is one of the season &apos;s most important events
because of the magnitude of their outreach .
mrs. grayson , may i ?
as i &apos;m sure most of you know ,
open arms always selects one charity
to highlight at the gala .
this year , they &apos;ll recognize the hard work
of the victims &apos; united outreach .
victims &apos; united ?
conceived in 1995 by the families
of the passengers who lost their lives on flight 1 @-@ 9 @-@ 7 .
their mission is to provide aid and counsel
to the survivors of terrorism
in 63 countries around the world .
wow . what a wonderful cause .
the graysons were the ones
who first endowed the organization back in 1995
so ... open arms has decided
to honor them for their pioneering efforts .
congratulations , victoria .
no one deserves the recognition more than you .
lydia .
i had no idea you were still doing work for open arms .
but more importantly ,
i thought you &apos;d decided to summer elsewhere .
well , what can i say ?
it was a decision wasn &apos;t entirely comfortable with .
and now that my divorce is finalized , thank god ,
it &apos;s my full intention to return to the fold .
if you &apos;ll have me , of course .
of course .
michael &apos;s loss is our gain .
excuse me . i really do have to take this .
how did you like the surprise ?
well , if sending lydia over to our house
is your idea of a surprise ,
then you &apos;ve grossly misjudged my sense of humor .
wait a minute . lydia came to the house ?
you have completely mishandled this situation .
uh , y @-@ you &apos;re right . i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;ll talk to frank and decide how best to proceed .
in the meantime , try to find it in your heart to accept my honest apology .
and if not my apology , then at leas accept the car .
what car ?
this is a $ 200,000 car , easy .
oh , yeah ? see those pedals ?
one &apos;s a brake , one &apos;s a gas ,
same as a dump truck .
i &apos;m sorry i came by unannounced .
the truth is , is i had no idea
you were having a luncheon today .
why would you ? it was by invite only .
i came to apologize .
for sleeping with my husband or for blackmailing us ?
i &apos;m just not quite sure
which apology i should be aiming my forgiveness at .
i made a terrie mistake with conrad .
and if i could go back and undo it ,
i swear , i would .
you &apos;re mone true friend , victoria .
i miss you .
i miss us .
lydia ,
what a surprise to see you again--
twice in one day .
i packed up some of your things and sent them to you .
you shouldn &apos;t have gone through the trouble .
please think about what i said .
twice in one day ?
lydia came by this morning ,
begging for her house back .
some mixup in the divorce settlement .
well , it &apos;s a fantastic piece of real estate .
i forbid you to let go of it .
oh , i have no intention of it ,
but when i politely declined , she practically threatened me .
oh , it &apos;s an empty threat , i can assure you .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
i guess i &apos;m still on edge about what happened with dr. banks .
mm . it &apos;s safe to say that we all are .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that none of us saw
a saboteur tampering with the dvd
just before it played .
i was thinking the same thing this morning
when i was packing lydia &apos;s things .
i came across
this signed book by dr. banks
with some quote about
taking back control of her life .
i didn &apos;t know that lydia
was a patient of dr. banks .
well , why would you ?
she was one of the only people
whose sessions weren &apos;t exposed .
you &apos;re home .
i was beginning to question if you lived here anymore .
well , then we &apos;re even ,
because i was beginning to question
if you &apos;d lost my number .
w @-@ w--actually , i lost my phone .
uh , tyler told me you canceled dinner .
what is he talking about ?
i came by to see what you like to eat .
i &apos;ll kill him .
i stared at empty chair for two hours
until i finally accepted that you had stood me up .
your chair didn &apos;t look so empty to me .
i saw you and jack through the windows .
i know . i &apos;m not proud of it .
i made that dinner for you , daniel .
jack and i are just friends .
he came by unexpected and he was hungry .
i didn &apos;t want the food to go to waste .
i &apos;m such an idiot .
yeah , a little bit .
you know , i was supposed to start working for my dad today , but couldn &apos;t do it .
why not ?
because he &apos;s a philandering dirtbag .
and if i can &apos;t look at him ,
how am i supposed to work for him ?
are you sure you &apos;re not using
the fact that he &apos;s a philandering dirtbag
as an excuse not to have to work for him ?
well , it &apos;s not just that ...
i &apos;m finally seeing him for what he really is .
i think it &apos;s also that he now sees me for what i really am .
and what &apos;s that ?
scared ...
i guess .
it &apos;s a hell of a lot harder to disappoint your father
than to let him know he disappointed you .
daniel , is that you ?
no , it &apos;s the other child ,
the disposable one .
oh , charlotte , don &apos;t talk like that .
here are the keys to your new car .
ground me , restrict me-- do whatever you want .
i could honestly care less .
you keep it .
you &apos;re giving me a $ 200,000 car ?
if it means that you &apos;ll stop this torture ,
then , yes .
wow , mom .
i guess you really do love me after all .
hey , rock star .
missed you at the office today .
why would you lie to me about emily canceling our date ?
i was just trying to protect you
from making a mistake .
that is a load of crap .
seriously , danny ...
do you remember when i dated claire sedgely ,
and you swore up and down that she wasn &apos;t good for me ,
even though i didn &apos;t want to hear it ?
oh , that--that &apos;s not the same thing .
it &apos;s not even in the same ballpark .
it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
whose idea was it to have that pledge hit on her
to prove that she would cheat on me , huh ?
brother to brother ,
i was just trying to help .
well , do me a favor . don &apos;t .
how did you get over to lydia &apos;s house , shamu ?
and who do we have behind door number one ?
have you lost your mind ?
what the hell kif stunt are you pulling ,
showing up at my house ?
i went to see victoria .
it had nothing to do with you .
nothing to do with me , huh ?
victoria is seething .
that &apos;s exactly why i went .
i &apos;m trying to repair the damage that my relationship with you
caused our friendship .
a friendship that exists only in your imagination , i assure you .
she just needs more time .
rather than making this harder ,
you might want to think about
facilitating a detente for the two of us .
a detente ...
between my mistress and my wife ?
if i &apos;m gonna get my life back ,
then i need victoria to accept me .
and i can &apos;t think of a better place
than the open arms benefit .
get her on board , conrad .
otherwise--
otherwise what ...
another empty threat ?
empty ?
how does this sound ?
the graysons are incredibly powerful , your honour .
i was intimidated into helping them frame david clarke .
and then threatened by their head of security
if i didn &apos;t comply .
the prosecution rests .
you &apos;re bluffing .
try me .
i tried to reason with her .
lydia doesn &apos;t want money anymore .
the only thing that &apos;ll placate her
is if victoria welcomes her back into the fold .
i am not welcoming that scheming harlot anywhere
until we &apos;ve exhausted all our options .
well , there &apos;s definitely
more aggressive ways to handle the situation .
hold on a minute .
she &apos;s a lonely socialite . she &apos;s not an ax murderer .
did she or did she not threaten to
take you down at the benefit tonight ?
yeah , she danced around it .
look , victoria , you asked me to call her bluff once .
i say we do it tonight .
well , that was before i found out
how completely unhinged she &apos;s become .
lydia was a patient of dr. banks ,
and her tapes were the only ones that weren &apos;t leaked .
you think she was behind the kidnapping ?
who knows what that woman &apos;s capable of ?
she could be behind everything
i &apos;ll get into it .
but if victoria &apos;s suspicions are right ,
we handle this my way .
conrad , you still have the keys to her place ?
backseat glove box .
what are you doing ?
lydia davis ...
is on to you .
what are you talking about ?
well , one minute she &apos;s pounding chardonnay
and yelling at conrad .
the next , she &apos;s staring
at a photograph from a grayson party .
she spent her morning calling catering companies
asking about employee rosters from a new year &apos;s eve party back in 2003 .
how could you know all of this ?
i @-@ i might have bugged your house .
you what ?
well , i @-@ i promised your father
that i would look after you .
i mean , look ...
you practically throw me out every time i &apos;m here ,
so it was the best way i knew how , and ...
i don &apos;t know how the camera ended up at lydia &apos;s .
it &apos;s probably &apos; cause i shipped it to her .
we have to get our hands on that photograph .
why ? what has she stumbled on to ?
a few months after i was released from juvie ,
i catered a new year &apos;s eve party for grayson global .
i wanted to see for myself who those people were .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t go all ninja on them
right then and there .
the event planner was called consummate catering .
i need you to hack into their employee database ,
find my name , and delete it .
i &apos;m gonna be late for this party . can you do it ?
mm . i &apos;ll try .
but just in case ,
you might want to whip up a story about
why billionaire emily thorne
needs to spend her new year &apos;s eve slinging champagne at corporate events .
emily thorne didn &apos;t
work that party , nolan .
amanda clarke did .
it was before i changed my name .
good evening , ms. thorne .
if i had known you were coming ,
we could have all ridden over together .
well , next time .
victoria , you look beautiful .
as do you .
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ve talked to daniel .
yes . we cleared up our misunderstanding .
but if you &apos;re wondering why he &apos;s not here this evening ,
i &apos;m afraid it has more to do
with things at home than with me .
lydia !
ashley , would you please take us to our table ?
of course . follow me .
as you &apos;re no longer simple guests ,
but official honorees ,
the organizers have arranged for you to sit
at the victims &apos; united table .
mrs. grayson , this is you .
i lost both my sons
and my husband on that plane .
and as angry as i am at the people who are responsible ,
i am determined to do something positive with my family &apos;s legacy .
i just don &apos;t know what that is yet .
we have to help her .
we have to help all of &apos; em .
it &apos;s not a good idea to
draw attention back to the company .
as far as the world is concerned ,
david clarke is responsible for that crash .
the world doesn &apos;t know what happened ,
and i cannot live with this guilt anymore .
no , she might be right , frank .
endowing a charity could serve
to improve the company &apos;s public image .
now you have about half an hour
until lydia introduces you .
lydia &apos;s introducing us ?
i think it was supposed to be a surprise ,
but i know how you detest those .
enjoy .
we have to talk to frank .
lydia , aren &apos;t you dressed to kill ?
i hope you got that box that i sent you .
i did , though it really sn &apos;t necessary ,
as you won &apos;t be in my house much longer .
pack your bags , sweetie .
i found your southfork inn .
hey , houston . we have a problem .
that , uh , catering company only has a hard copy of the employee manifest ,
which they &apos;re faxing over to lydia any minute now .
all right . i &apos;m heading over there .
i &apos;ll let you know when it comes through .
damn it .
daniel &apos;s here .
well ... let me do it .
i &apos;ll fire up the chopper ,
and i @-@ i can be downtown in 20 minutes .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna text you lydia &apos;s address .
as soon as you get that fax , let me know .
daniel .
you made it .
shall we ?
视频会话
victoria , you were right .
lydia is behind everything .
i just found her
open arms speech on her computer .
she is planning to expose you tonight .
you have proof of this ?
i &apos;m staring at it right now .
she writes , &quot; ladies and gentlemen ,
everyone here tonight is a victim , a victim of fraud and deceit
so dark and despicable
that it has taken me 15 terrible years
to tell the truth about the monsters responsible--
victoria and conrad grayson . &quot;
what do you want me to do ?
i &apos;ll handle her from this end ,
and you handle her from yours .
lydia .
what did you say to her ?
exactly what she was so desperate to hear .
what do we do now ?
sit and pray that she believed me .
thank you all .
so much could be said for the remarkable benefactors
that i &apos;ve been asked to introduce tonight .
but knowing them as well as i do ,
i &apos;m certain that they would rather
i recognize their charity instead .
please join me in honoring my dear friends
conrad and victoria grayson
and the heroic members
of victims &apos; united outreach .
let me get this straight .
your mom said she was sorry , then she gave you this car ?
just gave it to you , like it was nothing .
it is nothing .
oh , you guys got some cool ways of resolving your family issues .
oh , my god .
charlotte , um , pull over .
listen , dad ...
the world you operate in isn &apos;t for me .
i don &apos;t want to follow your path .
then what path do you plan to follow , daniel ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , maybe i can hasten your decision .
till you come to your senses ,
i &apos;m freezing your trust .
do whatever you have to , dad .
well done , lydia .
i am so happy that we &apos;re friends again .
well , it certainly appears that way , doesn &apos;t it ?
but then again ,
appearances can be deceiving , can &apos;t they ?
and you &apos;ve practically made it an art form .
understand something , lydia .
every time i smile at you across a room ,
or we run into each other at a luncheon ,
or i welcome you into my home ...
let that smile be a reminder
of just how much i despise you .
and that every time i hug you ,
the warmth you feel
is my hatred burning through .
good @-@ bye , lydia .
my husband &apos;s waiting for me .
looks like i may not be the only grayson
getting cut off tonight .
my sister just got arrested .
what ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
it was all you ...
destroying senator kingsly ,
dr. banks , bill harmon , extorting conrad .
you really take this &quot; woman scorned &quot;
thing seriously , don &apos;t you ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
get out !
help ! somebody , help !
everything okay ?
yes . sorry ... for all the texting .
just a friend .
are you gonna tell your parents about charlotte ?
no . i mean , compared to
the rest of the secrets in this family ,
this is a drop in the bucket .
she &apos;s lucky to have you looking out for her .
i wish i had someone
like that growing up .
well , you have someone like that now .
so ...
how do i look $ 100 million lighter ?
how do you feel $ 100 million lighter ?
kind of liberated , actually .
the truth can do that .
one day , your father might even respect you for it .
well , till then , i guess we &apos;ll go dutch .
it &apos;s too bad your dad isn &apos;t around
to see the kind of person you turned out to be .
he &apos;d be proud .
emily .
jack , hi .
what are you ...
danny .
thank you so much .
can you believe they thought
i stole the car ?
what i can &apos;t believe is
that you were doing 70 in a 40 .
you okay ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
it &apos;s no big deal .
how much is this little stunt gonna cost me ?
not a thing .
they were just holding them to teach &apos; em a lesson .
said i was part of the family , they let him out .
thank you .
i ... i owe you one .
come on , dec.
hey , jack .
now that you mention it ,
that bartending gig still open ?
yeah , why ?
turns out , i kinda need a job .
any chance you &apos;d give me a shot ?
give me a call at the bar .
what a night .
i &apos;ll say .
you really serious about taking that job at the stowaway ?
right now , all i &apos;m serious about
is taking you to the bedroom .
then what are you waiting for ?
guilt is a powerful affliction .
you can try to turn your back on it ,
but that &apos;s when it sneaks up behind you
and eats you alive .
it &apos;s frank .
i have some bad news to report .
lydia davis just jumped off her balcony .
call me when you get this .
some people struggle to understand their own guilt .
unwilling or unable to justify the part they play in it .
others run away from their guilt ,
shedding their conscience
until there &apos;s no conscience left at all .
help !
but i run toward my guilt .
i feed off of it .
i need it .
you &apos;ve called emily . leave a message .
emily ... where the hell are you ?
i think frank just killed lydia .
my father died never knowing
if i would ever come to believe his innocence .
for me , guilt is one of the few lanterns
