so , any idea when you guys might decide
if i can go on tour this summer ?
yes , you can go .
my parents want us to stay in motels ,
or they won &apos;t let us go .
won &apos;t let you go .
mariana came to see me yesterday .
she thought i should ask you to adopt the baby .
and i think it &apos;s a good idea .
have you heard anything about tasha ?
i get my first supervised visit on saturday .
what ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
last time i seen her ...
she won &apos;t remember that .
what if she remembers being scared
&apos;cause some stranger took her ?
callie , can we ask you a few questions ?
what about ?
do you remember buying this ?
because the salesperson remembers selling it to you .
is that a crime ?
no , but kidnapping is .
i &apos;m 16 . aren &apos;t i allowed to
have a parent here when you ask me questions ?
i &apos;m robert quinn . i &apos;m callie &apos;s father .
look , callie , it was christmas .
your friend , daphne , just wasn &apos;t thinking straight .
she missed her baby . she saw an opportunity ,
and she took her .
i might &apos;ve done the same thing if that was my kid .
that &apos;s a sad story , but what does it have to do with my client ?
kidnapping is a very serious crime .
now , we don &apos;t think your client had anything to do with it ,
but obstructing justice is also serious .
do you have any actual questions for callie ?
honey , we understand you want to protect your friend .
but what about that little girl ?
how scared she must have been being taken from the park
by a stranger .
look , all you have to do is tell us the truth .
you gave daphne this wind @-@ up toy
that tasha was holding when she was returned .
isn &apos;t that right ?
or maybe you really were involved .
maybe you helped .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want to talk .
ok , enough .
are you seriously trying to connect my client
with an alleged crime through a tito the chihuahua toy ?
how many of those things do you think are out there ?
a few hundred thousand ?
but only one was sold at this store .
and she bought it .
says who ?
says the salesperson that sold it to you , callie .
the same day tasha was kidnapped .
you got a receipt ?
look , we asked a question .
why don &apos;t you just let your client answer ?
because you &apos;re flying blind here .
all you &apos;ve got is a wind @-@ up toy and a far @-@ out theory .
we &apos;re done here .
yeah , this is good , i &apos;ll walk from here .
thank you for coming .
yeah , no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m glad you called .
i would &apos;ve called stef and lena , but ...
but , callie , if you &apos;re just protecting daphne ...
i &apos;m not just protecting her .
ok , then you do exactly what the lawyer told you .
they can &apos;t prove that you
bought that toy or that you gave it to daphne .
the only way they can connect you to what happened ...
is if i talk , i know .
you can &apos;t tell anyone , even me ,
anything that could get you in trouble .
and i don &apos;t want you talking to daphne about this .
or any one else .
this is a very serious crime .
anyone involved with this in any way
could go to jail .
and stef , you know , she &apos;s a police officer .
she can &apos;t protect you ,
not without risking her own career .
i know . that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t call her .
look , it &apos;s gonna be ok .
you call me if the police
try to question you or if you need anything .
i &apos;m gonna take care of this .
and you . ok ?
ok .
wait a minute .
what do you have to say for yourself , young lady ?
getting up at 6 : 00 am on a saturday to go to work .
impressive .
oh , well , i &apos;m volunteering at the drop @-@ in center later
so i had to pick up the breakfast shift .
oh , yeah , they do a big breakfast hamburger business ?
yeah , like , eggs and stuff .
you all right ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just tired .
well , don &apos;t run yourself ragged , honey .
you can always cancel your shift at the center .
no , no , i &apos;m fine .
they need the help , trust me .
oh , uh , daphne &apos;s here . i almost forgot .
daphne &apos;s here ?
yeah , we told her she could wait in your room .
thanks .
hey . everything ok ?
no .
i don &apos;t have anything to wear .
wait ... farm party ? like haystacks and stuff ?
no , dude .
it &apos;s , like , pharm , p @-@ h @-@ a @-@ r @-@ m .
admission is $ 10 cash plus a prescription pill ,
现场音乐
which they toss into a big bowl and pass around .
so wait ... people just take whatever pill they pick ,
without even knowing what it is ?
that &apos;s beyond stupid ...
i mean , we don &apos;t have to do it . we just have to play .
do you wanna go on tour or not ?
i mean , you could end up making a lot more than
the $ 200 we &apos;re guaranteed if there &apos;s a big turnout .
what do you mean , &quot; i could ? &quot;
we &apos;re giving you the money .
all of it ?
all of it . it was lou &apos;s idea .
really ?
ok , thanks .
but i don &apos;t want mariana coming , ok ?
just in case .
are you gonna be the one to tell her she can &apos;t come ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not .
i &apos;m not afraid of mariana .
you should be .
i think of it as a healthy fear .
she has a way of getting what she wants .
did she talk to you about the tour yet ?
what about it ?
you told ana that she should ask us to adopt her baby ?
no .
i mean , yeah , kinda .
was she mad ?
what ?
she wasn &apos;t mad .
she actually agreed with you , mariana .
she asked us to take the baby .
she did ?
oh , my god . you guys , this was totally meant to be .
i mean , we lost frankie ...
whoa , whoa . slow down .
we haven &apos;t made any decisions yet .
what do you mean ?
we &apos;d be saving this baby from a terrible life .
we don &apos;t know that , love , we don &apos;t .
you said yourself that ana has no business taking care of a baby
when she can &apos;t even care for herself .
this is a huge commitment , honey .
and your mom and i need to
talk about this before we make any decisions . ok ?
ok .
you know , i don &apos;t get it . you took jude and callie in .
and this baby , she &apos;s my sister .
ouch .
you know , i wonder if ana &apos;s talked to mike about this .
he &apos;s gonna lose it .
he &apos;s been working overtime trying
to convince her that she can stay clean and do this .
exactly .
she &apos;s probably just gonna change her mind anyway .
yeah , but what if she doesn &apos;t ?
what are we gonna tell the twins then ?
we tell them we have to do what &apos;s right for the whole family .
you wanted a baby .
i didn &apos;t just want a baby , honey .
i wanted the experience of being pregnant , of giving birth .
and as horrible as i feel saying it ,
i wanted a child that was biologically a part of me .
that &apos;s not horrible .
it &apos;s not that i would have loved frankie more ,
i just ... i wanted what you have , all of it .
foster , adopted , and biological children .
i understand .
i know you don &apos;t think i can , but i do .
it &apos;s just not the way it happened .
and maybe whatever it is that controls our destiny ,
you know , whether it &apos;s fate or god ... or whatever .
maybe ... maybe it &apos;s just
opened a different door for us to walk through .
nothing too ... white lady goes to brunch .
i want to look like me , just like the nice me .
why don &apos;t you just wear what you &apos;re wearing ?
you look fine .
it &apos;s not like tasha &apos;s going to care .
it &apos;s my first visitation .
i just want it to be perfect .
what about that ?
really ?
yeah .
it &apos;s gonna be fine .
you know , tasha &apos;s just gonna be excited to see her mom .
she &apos;s not gonna recognize me
as the lady that took her from the park now .
will she ?
no . no way .
flintwood has one of the best athletic programs in the country .
wrestling , for example .
we &apos;ve been national champions
in our division three of the last four years .
just three ? slackers .
all right . well , we also offer top notch academics .
the best education money can buy .
it sounds cool , really cool .
i &apos;m not gonna sugar coat it , school &apos;s not really my thing .
look , a lot of our students have those challenges .
and this is where being an all @-@ boys school can really be helpful .
there aren &apos;t any distractions .
but i like distractions . especially girl ones .
don &apos;t worry , there &apos;ll be plenty of time to socialize .
but we &apos;ve tailored the curriculum to the ways boys learn best .
which is , you know , not necessarily
sitting still inside a classroom .
we take an active approach
with an emphasis on sports , and camaraderie .
kinda like the military .
have you thought about college ?
i &apos;ve thought about how embarrassing it &apos;s going to be
when everyone gets in ... and i don &apos;t .
that &apos;s not gonna happen ,
not if you treat flintwood the way you treat wrestling .
you worked hard and it paid off .
you went from being a promising wrestler
to one who is being recruited by a prestigious school .
you did that .
even if i wanted to check it out , my moms couldn &apos;t afford it .
we have a big family and i &apos;m an eater .
that wouldn &apos;t be an issue .
i &apos;m offering you a scholarship .
you mean it &apos;d be free ?
yes .
when did that happen ?
when i went to the eye doctor and couldn &apos;t read the chart .
so , what , you wear glasses now ?
no . you will never see me wear glasses .
no one will ever see me wear glasses .
i just need to figure out these contacts .
i don &apos;t think i can watch .
i know .
it &apos;s making me nauseous .
speaking of things that make me nauseous ,
mat said you want to come on tour with us .
no way . that &apos;s not happening .
ok .
what ... i &apos;m sorry , what ? what &apos;s ok ?
you &apos;re allowed to have your opinion .
but it &apos;s not really your decision to make , it &apos;s moms .
come on , mariana . we &apos;re not bringing girlfriends .
you &apos;re bringing yours .
yeah , she &apos;s in the band !
look , i &apos;m prepared to do my part .
i &apos;m gonna sell merch and help with bookings and stuff .
i &apos;ll be like your manager .
ok . there &apos;s still no way in hell
moms are going to let you go .
i mean , they &apos;re barely letting me go
and that &apos;s only if i raise all this money .
which i can help you with .
how ?
oh , look . we &apos;re already up to 150 .
that &apos;s cool . that &apos;s really cool , actually .
but i still don &apos;t think moms gonna let you go .
why ? because i &apos;m a girl ?
that &apos;s a total double standard .
our moms are feminists .
no , because you &apos;re 15 , mariana .
oh , please you &apos;re not even a whole year older than me .
and don &apos;t be so sure i can &apos;t convince them .
i &apos;m gonna tell them i &apos;m gonna keep an eye on you .
maybe i don &apos;t want the responsibility of keeping my eye on you .
which is what i &apos;m going to tell them .
and speaking of which ,
i don &apos;t think you should go to the gig tonight .
ok , it &apos;s gonna be a rough crowd .
brandon , that &apos;s very sweet ,
but if it &apos;s too scary for me to go ,
well , i should probably warn moms about it , right ?
i mean , do you think they want you
playing in front of a &quot; rough crowd ? &quot;
glad we had this talk though .
i &apos;ll see you tonight !
jimmy .
hey , can you cover the desk for me ?
yeah , sure . hey , is that your friend , right there ?
the one who &apos;s having her visitation today ?
yeah .
cool . tell her good luck .
thanks .
hey . you look nice .
this is a mistake .
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s gonna remember me .
why was i so stupid ?
daphne , listen to me .
everything is gonna be fine .
but you have to stop we can never talk about that ever again , ok ?
look who &apos;s here .
can you say , &quot; hi &quot; ?
can i give her a hug ?
so jesus is going to the movie , brandon &apos;s band is playing
and jude is going on another &quot; group date , &quot;
so , looks like we &apos;re on our own tonight .
really ? home alone .
what ever will we do ?
we could order in . how about mexican ?
yeah , we could do mexican , but it &apos;s awfully ... filling .
uh , thai ?
spicy .
you love spicy .
spicy &apos;s not sexy .
you think you &apos;re getting laid tonight ?
well , it has been a while .
i didn &apos;t know we were keeping track .
i &apos;m not keeping track .
it &apos;s just ...
it hasn &apos;t just been me .
i know . it &apos;s both of us .
so ... you wanna ... ?
yeah , sure , i mean ,
how often do we get the house all to ourselves ?
we gotta take advantage of it , right ?
absolutely . so ...
wine ? oh , please .
get the good stuff .
i came by to help you load up .
thanks , but mat was here a while ago ,
and i think we took care of it .
sweet .
all the credit , none of the work .
hey , thanks for giving me the door tonight .
mat said it was your idea .
i &apos;m sorry i wasn &apos;t being more supportive .
i really don &apos;t wanna go without you .
i don &apos;t want that either .
but i thought about it and you have to .
if i can &apos;t go , i mean .
and , i mean , don &apos;t worry , i get it .
you &apos;ve worked so hard for this .
you have to do it , ok , no matter what .
careful . i don &apos;t want to mess up my look .
do i ... ? how do i look ? am i ok ?
ok , let &apos;s go .
yes .
ok .
you wanna do a bigger one ?
yes , a bigger one .
ok , do a bigger one .
so how long have you been in ?
foster care , i mean .
six years .
i was in for eight .
my dad took off and my mom was ... is mentally ill .
you were a foster kid ?
oh , yeah .
coulda used a place like this back then , that &apos;s for sure .
it sucked , but , you know ,
it inspired me to go to grad school , become a social worker .
right some wrongs , maybe .
you know ?
did you ever find a permanent placement ?
no , no , i ended up living in a group home until i aged out .
how about you ?
how &apos;s the home you &apos;re in now ?
i love the family i live with .
they even adopted my brother .
oh . but not you ?
i know you took her !
go on ! play with her . play with her like nothing happened !
you may have everybody else fooled , but i know !
wendy , wendy ...
i know what you did !
this isn &apos;t appropriate .
i saw you !
i &apos;ve seen you before at the park !
i know you took her !
i know you took my baby !
you need to leave . you are not allowed to be here .
but she is ?
ma &apos;am , that &apos;s enough . you need to leave . now .
i &apos;m so sorry , ms. keene ...
don &apos;t apologize to her , she &apos;s a criminal .
you might have them fooled , but i know better .
and believe me , i &apos;m gonna make damn sure
the police figure it out , too .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m letting that baby girl go back to you .
tasha belongs with us .
you can &apos;t do that . she &apos;s my baby !
mommy !
sweetheart .
you would take tasha back to me and leave .
i will bring her back to you at the end of the visit .
it &apos;s ok . i &apos;m gonna see you back at home in just a bit , ok ?
be good , baby .
if you care about tasha , if you really care about her ,
you should let her go .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
hi . i &apos;m with , someone &apos;s little sister .
good for you . whose little sister ?
the band . i &apos;m with the band .
who isn &apos;t ? where &apos;s your cover ?
seriously ?
fine .
and where &apos;s the rest of it ?
a pill . you need a pill .
dude , dude , she &apos;s with the band .
what , so , as long as a guy
tells you i &apos;m with the band , then you believe me ?
please don &apos;t get into a fight with the bouncer .
what &apos;s with the pills ? i thought it was a farm party ?
like barn animals .
i wore denim .
this band is cute .
we could make some real money tonight .
no , i &apos;m good .
what &apos;re you doing ?
having fun . relax .
callie , what was all that . i don &apos;t get it .
if tasha &apos;s foster mom is screaming at the police ,
telling &apos; em i took tasha ,
how come they ain &apos;t ever questioned me ?
they don &apos;t have any proof .
you don &apos;t know that .
maybe they have something and they &apos;re just waitin &apos; .
maybe i should get outta town or somethin &apos; .
no , daphne , stop , you don &apos;t have to run .
i know they don &apos;t have any evidence
because they came to the burger stand
this morning to question me .
why the hell you ain &apos;t tell me ?
&apos;cause robert &apos;s lawyer told me
i couldn &apos;t say anything , even to you .
ok , i was trying to protect you .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do that .
i know .
how &apos;d they know to come to you if they ain &apos;t got no evidence ?
you remember the toy , wind @-@ up dog i gave you ?
you gave it to tasha , right ?
so they traced it back to the store
where i bought it and the clerk id &apos;d me .
what ?
yeah , but it &apos;s cool though .
&apos;cause they can &apos;t prove that i gave it to you .
i think the cops probably came to me
thinking that i would tell you
and that you would panic and do something stupid ,
but you &apos;re not going to , right ?
you &apos;re going to stay calm . hey .
i don &apos;t know if i could do that .
you know me , callie . staying cool is not my strength .
well , you have to . all right , if not for you , for me .
hey , and for brandon .
and tasha . ok ?
hey . do you know this p @-@ h @-@ a @-@ r @-@ m party ?
i didn &apos;t even know that was a thing .
yeah , that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t want you to come .
are you ... you &apos;re not gonna take anything , are you ?
no ! that &apos;d be ...
beyond stupid .
yeah .
time for us to set up .
wish me luck .
you don &apos;t need it .
why are you winking when you say that ?
wait , are you being ironic in that way i totally don &apos;t get ?
no , no , there &apos;s just ...
there &apos;s something in my ... i &apos;m all good .
i just ... i gotta find a bathroom .
but kill it ! i &apos;ll be the one hollering the loudest .
i should come with you .
no , no ! you &apos;re about to go on .
i &apos;ll be quick . don &apos;t worry about me .
this is totally my scene .
sorry . excuse me .
how you feeling ?
dude , chill .
i &apos;m fine . i just like to take the edge off before i play .
it &apos;s a great crowd . let &apos;s have fun .
excuse me . is there a bathroom around here ?
this ain &apos;t the house of blues , it &apos;s a warehouse .
people are peeing out back behind the dumpsters .
want me to meet you out there ?
no . no , thank you .
...... i told you to lock this up .
my equipment &apos;s spendy .
someone &apos;s in here ! i &apos;m in here !
hello !
hello ! someone &apos;s in here !
daphne keene .
we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
great job today .
i try my best .
well , you succeed .
you have a ride home ?
i &apos;m just gonna take the bus .
oh , no , i &apos;m happy to drop you off .
really , it &apos;s fine .
thanks .
hey , can i ask you something ?
what was all that about , this afternoon ?
i mean , was that woman
seriously accusing your friend of kidnapping ?
i don &apos;t know . she wants to adopt daphne &apos;s baby ,
so i guess she thought ...
love makes people do crazy things , i guess .
actually , i think i &apos;m just gonna take the bus .
but thank you .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean to pry .
no , you didn &apos;t .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
ok , slow down . ok .
hey ! are you ok ?
are you all right ?
don &apos;t feel bad about it , honey .
we &apos;ve got a lot on our plates .
yeah , well , you know , so do molly and tracy ,
but to hear them talk about it ,
they go at it like bunnies .
yeah , well , they don &apos;t have five kids
and three birth parents to worry about .
and any couple who says they &apos;re always having sex , isn &apos;t .
remember hope and kim ?
they used to always brag
about their sex lives and then when they broke up ,
hope told me they hadn &apos;t had sex in six years .
you &apos;re kidding me ! six years ?
you know what , my love , i am not complaining about our sex life .
i just ... i just ... i just don &apos;t want us to get complacent .
i mean , i want us to stay on it because , i &apos;m sorry ,
but lesbian bed death is a real thing . it &apos;s real .
more wine ?
i thought you would never ask . and you know what ?
i think after that , we should head up to bed , naked ,
and make it happen .
last one to bed has to be the top !
hey ! you &apos;re a cheater .
that &apos;s an unfair advantage . such a ... you &apos;re so ...
help !
i need you to stay awake for me , can you do that ?
maybe we should try and walk around a little .
oh , my god !
i &apos;m sorry .
i think i had too much wine .
maybe next time we should have sex before dinner .
or maybe we should have dinner .
and less drinks .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine .
i know , i know , i know . but at least you , you know ...
you got there .
you did get there , didn &apos;t you ?
i ... sorta got there .
it didn &apos;t sound like you &quot; sorta got there . &quot;
did you fake your orgasm ?
no ! i didn &apos;t fake it .
i ... may have embellished it a little .
what ?
why ? ....
i didn &apos;t want to hurt your feelings , love ,
and i had an emotional ... one .
an emotional orgasm ?
why does sex have to be so goal oriented ?
it doesn &apos;t .
which is why you don &apos;t need
to embellish anything to make me feel better .
ok . there was a lot of pressure tonight , i think .
all the pressure to have sex tonight was coming from you .
ok , ok ...
for the record , i would have been happy just cuddling .
then let &apos;s cuddle a bit . let &apos;s just cuddle , ok ?
you have been fake to before ?
oh , come on , haven &apos;t you ever ?
no . never with you .
and can i just say , please , that going forward
if one of us , you know , can &apos;t get there ,
we just be honest about it .
we &apos;ve been together for ten years . i mean ...
well , it is true that you know , sex gets a little harder
after you &apos;ve been with someone for so long .
it &apos;s not as new and exciting
like it was in the beginning .
come on .
i still get excited every time you walk through the door at night .
it may not be new , but it &apos;s better .
this is my favorite part .
of tonight ?
of everything .
me too .
we have to remember to take care of us , ok ?
in a little more than a year ,
callie and brandon are gonna be gone
and the twins after that ...
thank god for jude .
at least we &apos;ll be able to have some more &quot; us &quot; time ...
i mean , unless we ...
we take ana &apos;s baby ?
what do you think ? do you want to ?
thank you ! we &apos;re someone &apos;s little sister !
we &apos;re touring this summer , check us out online !
hey callie , what &apos;re you doing here ?
mariana called me . she &apos;s locked inside a storage unit .
what ? where ?
somewhere around here .
this is rafael . we work together at the drop @-@ in center .
have you seen mariana ?
cops !
this is the police ! stop the music ! and stay where you are !
stop the music .
i repeat . this is the police !
stay where you are ! we have a medical emergency .
i &apos;ll repeat , we have a medical emergency .
we need you to stay put
and stay quiet so the emt &apos;s can do their jobs !
you gotta get outta here .
callie ! what are you doing ?
what &apos;s going on ?
help ! we need help !
stay back . just stay where you are .
in here , please .
in here !
oh , my god ! hurry ! she &apos;s barely breathing .
what &apos;s her name ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know her .
do you know what she took ?
no idea .
she &apos;s ok . go .
she &apos;s on probation . take her .
go , i &apos;ll take care of mariana , go .
miss , can you hear me ? open your eyes .
can you hear me ?
ma &apos;am .
at least no one got arrested .
we didn &apos;t get paid either .
go ahead and say it .
i know you &apos;re dying to .
ok , fine . this is why it &apos;s a bad idea for you
to come with us on tour with us this summer . you can &apos;t handle it .
what was i supposed to do , let the girl od
so the show could go on ?
no , but if you hadn &apos;t been locked
in a storage unit in the first place ...
then no one might have found her and she could have died .
i &apos;m sorry my stupid contact were bothering me .
contacts ?
since when ?
not the hot issue here , mat .
so , yeah , i &apos;m sorry i got locked in a storage unit .
but i am not sorry that i called the police and possibly
saved that girl &apos;s life .
i didn &apos;t say that calling the police was a mistake .
i &quot; handled &quot; myself fine .
you &apos;re just mad because you know
you shouldn &apos;t have been playing a gig like that anyway .
i didn &apos;t realize mariana wanted to go on tour with us .
you &apos;re totally right , it &apos;s a terrible idea .
we don &apos;t have time to be baby @-@ sitting her on the road .
yeah , because i &apos;m going to be busy baby @-@ sitting you .
what are you talking about ?
you totally screwed up
on stage tonight when you took those pills .
come on . it wasn &apos;t a big deal .
because i covered for you .
is that what it &apos;s gonna be like on tour ?
is this what it &apos;s gonna be like on tour ?
you judging my every move ?
you tell me . i mean ,
are you gonna get too high every night to perform ?
i forgot a lyric .
that happens when i &apos;m sober , too .
and i barely felt anything from those pills .
half the stuff people bring is aspirin .
is that supposed to be comforting ?
i &apos;m not the one who screwed up tonight , ok .
thanks to your sister , we didn &apos;t get any money for the gig .
this is not mariana &apos;s ...
she did the right thing , ok ? that girl almost died .
she &apos;s fine .
this could have been you ...
i don &apos;t ... care that you forgot some words to a stupid song .
i care that you took some freaking mystery pills
and didn &apos;t think about what would happen next .
this is me caring .
not judging .
i guess i &apos;m just ...
not used to people caring about me like that .
well get used to it .
you &apos;re right . it was dumb .
i &apos;m sorry .
i promise when we &apos;re on tour , i &apos;ll play all our gigs straight .
ok .
you &apos;re wrong about one thing though .
our songs aren &apos;t stupid .
they &apos;re awesome . at least mine are .
you &apos;re not mad at me because you didn &apos;t get paid , are you ?
no .
i mean , i was a little blind @-@ sided by that contacts reveal , but .
i &apos;m being serious .
so am i.
look , i don &apos;t think brandon meant to hurt you .
i think he was just upset at lou
and it came out wrong .
well , i &apos;m sure they &apos;ll work it out before we go on tour .
i don &apos;t want you to go on tour . please don &apos;t hate me .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i should have told you sooner , but i was ...
are you , like ... breaking up with me ?
no , no . i don &apos;t wanna break up .
or see anyone else .
it &apos;s not like that at all .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;ve been dreaming about this tour for years .
it &apos;s a chance for me to really focus on my music before ...
i don &apos;t know , life takes over .
it &apos;s something i want to do , just for me .
i wouldn &apos;t stop you from doing that .
i know .
but i would stop myself .
ok , tonight , through out the entire set
i was scanning the crowd looking for you .
and not because i was worried ,
but because i love you and i want to ...
... when you &apos;re in the room ,
you have my undivided attention .
i &apos;m sorry if that hurts your feelings .
why are you crying ?
i &apos;m not it &apos;s ... it &apos;s just my contacts .
mariana ...
ok , fine .
i &apos;m upset ...
really ?
really , but i &apos;ll get over it .
you promise ?
promise .
oh , jesus , come here ...
what is it ?
i need you to do something ...
nice glasses .
i &apos;m supposed to be in here ,
convincing you guys to adopt ana &apos;s baby .
mariana asked me to .
are you guys really thinking about that ?
well , we were hoping to talk to the both of you about this .
so you &apos;re not ...
look , jesus , the only reason we would even consider taking ana &apos;s baby
is because we love you and mariana very much
and this baby would be your sister .
and yes we wanted a baby .
but things change , honey .
we were just now sitting here talking about
how nice it is to get to spend some time alone together
every once in a while , just the two of us .
the truth is , we have so many legal expenses right now ,
trying to fight for callie ,
it &apos;s hard enough to put food on the table for five kids every night .
what if you guys had one less kid to feed ?
after today , you must think i &apos;m some kind of magnet for trouble .
no , no ...
i just hope that your friends ,
and your brothers and sisters ,
don &apos;t get you into trouble like that all the time .
i make way more trouble for them .
you never told me why you didn &apos;t get adopted .
my birth father is fighting for custody .
is he a bad guy ?
no , but i just found out about him .
and this is my home .
i love stef and lena
and i really want to be a part of the family .
but what ?
i did something ...
... that they don &apos;t know about and i can &apos;t tell them
because it would be really bad for a lot of people .
i just feel so bad lying to them .
you know , i can &apos;t even look them in the eye
and after everything they &apos;ve done , they don &apos;t deserve it .
callie , you have to tell them , whatever it is ?
you &apos;re not listening to me . i cannot tell them !
it would ruin lives and not just mine .
what &apos;re you gonna do ?
i mean , i &apos;m sure flintwood is a great school and all ...
it is . it &apos;s one of the best in the country .
i &apos;m not ready to say goodbye to our son .
i know . we &apos;re supposed to have two more years .
you don &apos;t think this is the universe punishing us
because when we were in bed
we said there would be some pluses
to having the kids out of the house ? we didn &apos;t mean tomorrow .
he &apos;s just a baby .
hey , sweet .
how was the center ?
it &apos;s good , pretty good .
there &apos;s something i have to tell you .
ok .
i think it would be ...
i think ...
i should go with robert .
