no rejection ?
i got shot down at fat camp .
boy , kids are mean when they &apos;re hungry .
so , what do i do ?
it &apos;s rachel . you &apos;re gonna never talk to her again ?
it &apos;s weird and it &apos;s awkward , but you gotta at least try .

and one of the great joys of life ..
is its wondrous unpredictability , you know ?
and also , tea tends to give me the trots .
okay . i &apos;m done . read mine .

has anyone seen my shirt ?
it &apos;s a button @-@ down , like a faded salmon color ?
you mean your pink shirt ?
faded salmon color ?
no , i haven &apos;t seen your pink shirt .
i must have left it at mona &apos;s . i knew it !
i &apos;m sure you can get another one at ann taylor &apos;s .
that &apos;s my favorite shirt . i love it .
ask mona to give it back .
i don &apos;t know . i could .
we didn &apos;t really end things on good terms .
if i went , i &apos;d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do ..
jump up my own ass and die .
oh , wait a second , you guys ?
i &apos;ve been seeing that guy everywhere i go .
we take the same bus , go to the same bookstore .
maybe he &apos;s the tea guy .
did you see that ?

just a little , you know .
&quot; joey loves you . be prepared . &quot;
sorry .

i &apos;ll save you time .
two hundred cds , not one of them in the right case .
okay . no need to panic . deep breaths , everyone .
we &apos;ll just have to put the cds in their right cases .
if we do that , we should come up with some kind of order .
y &apos;know alphabetically or by genre ?
we have to talk this through .
oh , my god , you have such problems ! i feel so terrible for you !
all right . okay , i &apos;m sorry .
you &apos;re both focusing on this uncomfortable thing .

and then when we were at the christmas party ..
he got drunk and said to me , &quot; rachel , i want to buy your baby . &quot;
when you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby ..
i figured it was about maternity leave .
