I'm done.
Got it. You can release the scene.
Okay.
Good night, Susie.
I have been sitting on prison point bridge all morning.
Literally sitting.
What moron closes a lane in the middle of rush hour?!
There's coffee.
Oh, thank god.
What? Are you researching CIA torture treatments?
Close. Medi-peutic -- it's a day spa.
This treatment utilizes
high-frequency electropulse therapy.
People actually pay money for that?
Oh, you don't want to know how much.
Give me a battery and some jumper cables.
I'll do it for ya.
I have a gift certificate for one treatment.
One? Oh, how ever will you decide?
I don't know. It's proving quite difficult.
How about a reparative oxygen and caviar plunge?
It's fish eggs.
Do you really need to know more?
Okay, fine. There are plenty of other options.
I think you should come with me, and we'll make a day of it.
Mm-hmm. Can't wait.
Oh. I think I just found the perfect treatment for you.
I bet you 5 bucks you're wrong.
Vino rejuvenation using the free radicals and antioxidants
found in grapevines,
and each treatment comes with wine.
How much wine?
Rizzoli.
Your very own bottle.
Isles.
Do you get the wine before the treatment?
Yep.
You win.
Okay, I'll make a deal with you.
I'll go to this medi spa -- whatever it's called --
if you go to a patriots game with me.
That hardly seems like a fair trade-off.
I know, but I'm willing to suffer through a massage
because I'm a giver.
You really called out the cavalry for this one.
Can I speak to you?
Maura, could you give us a second?
Sergeant Korsak?
Why would two medical examiners be called in on the same case?
That's a waste of resources.
Maura, um...
What's going on?
I'm so sorry.
It's Susie.
What?
What happened?
I don't know. Um, I-I'll go upstairs and find out.
Why don't you have a uniform take you home, okay?
No, I'll be fine.
I, uh...
Never knew she'd been skydiving.
She asked me to join her.
Now I wish I had.
You okay?
Not really.
Around 8:00 a.m. this morning,
A neighbor noticed the front door standing open.
They came in, found the body, called 911.
There was no sign of forced entry.
Well, they were looking for something.
Yeah. But her purse is still here.
It's got her credit cards, keys.
And her car is still parked in the garage.
Security cameras?
Outside the garage and at the front door.
They show her car entering around 11:26 p.m.
But nobody suspicious entered
at either the front or the back entrance around that time.
They might've already been waiting inside.
All right, let's get her back.
One moment.
Dr. Isles, I-I'm sorry. I-I would've waited. Just --
It's okay.
Findings?
Time of death was approximately
somewhere between midnight and 1:00 A.M.
Cause appears to be blunt-force trauma to the back of the head.
The victim shows no --
"Susie."
Sorry -- what?
Her name -- Susie.
I see no apparent signs of a struggle,
No signs of bruising,
or any other marks to Susie's body.
So it appears that she never saw it coming.
Let's hope not.
We'll find who did this, Maura.
No forced entry, no signs of struggle,
and she was attacked from behind.
You think Susie knew her killer? Maybe she let him in.
Well, what the hell were they looking for?
Jane. You need to see this.
All of this was hidden in the wall?
Yeah, along with this.
Shit!
Little over 5 grand.
What was Susie doing with evidence?
That's a good question.
Wait. You're kidding me, right?
There's no way Susie was dirty.
I didn't know her for very long.
But she seemed...
Well, she... seemed very competent.
She was -- exceedingly.
In Afghanistan, I lost a lot of colleagues.
I'm sorry.
I know how hard this is.
As Susie's employer and friend,
I have an obligation to recuse myself from the autopsy.
But I'd like to see the results as soon as possible.
Of course.
We have to treat this like any other case.
Dig into Susie's life and figure out
who had a reason to hurt her.
You mean find proof she was doing something illegal.
But she wasn't.
Frankie, if you need to step aside on this,
no one will think any less of you.
No, I'm fine.
No, seriously.
If you have to...
I'm fine.
Well, I talked to a couple of lab techs.
They don't think she had a boyfriend.
They didn't know about any threats.
And none of the neighbors reported anybody suspicious
hanging around over the last few days.
No arguments, nothing out of the ordinary.
Anything on the cellphone?
Nothing that stands out.
Friends and family mostly, a few work-related calls.
I also ran her bank records.
No big purchases or unusual deposits.
So we got nothing.
Except...
This.
It's hard to imagine Susie taking bribes
in exchange for altering evidence.
If she was, maybe her killer was searching
for a piece of evidence she'd taken.
Maybe they didn't want to pay a bribe.
Maybe they were looking for a more permanent solution.
We need to match all these to the cases they came from.
That'd be like finding a needle in a haystack.
Hundreds of pieces of evidence
come through the crime lab every week.
Then we need to talk to the one person who knows
what goes on down there better than anyone.
That's ridiculous.
At this point, it's just one avenue of investigation.
Well, it's a waste of time.
Susie Chang was one of the most principled people
I've ever known.
She would never tamper with evidence.
Maybe you could just take a look at the stuff we found,
see if you recognize any of it.
Without labels, it's impossible to say.
These could've come from anywhere.
But they didn't. They came from Susie's apartment.
Okay.
I will have the lab test them for DNA or prints.
Maybe we can find a match to an existing case.
Thank you.
Could you also give us a list of cases
Susie worked in recent weeks?
Of course.
But first, I need to call governor Holcomb.
What for?
Because this changes everything.
I mean, even a hint that a senior criminalist
in the medical examiner's office
was tampering with evidence is incendiary.
The press is gonna have a field day.
The press isn't gonna find out about it --
Not until we have proof.
A scandal like this could jeopardize every case
that has passed through this lab over the last few years --
Potentially thousands of cases.
She's right.
Maura, come on. At least give us a couple of days.
I cannot risk
the governor hearing this from anybody else.
Yes, uh, Governor Holcomb, please.
This is Dr. Maura Isles.
It's important. I'll hold.
I got that address.
Want to ride out together?
Yeah. Sure.
What address?
Susie was working a crime scene the night she was killed.
We're gonna check it out.
Nina and I will go over Susie's recent cases,
see if anything jumps out.
Okay.
The right is from cash found at the crime scene.
The left from senior criminalist Chang's personnel file.
An exact match.
Hardly surprised, though.
I mean, it was found in her apartment, right?
Yes, but I was hoping this would prove
that somebody else put it there.
Whoever -- whoever...killed her
could easily have put her prints onto the cash.
Of course.
But conjecture won't help us. We need proof.
And until we have it, we have to be very careful.
The medical examiner's office is gonna be under a microscope.
How can I help?
I need you to take the lead on this.
Everything has to be transparent.
All procedures and tests
according to the strictest guidelines.
I was Susie's direct supervisor,
so we have to avoid any suggestion
that I am trying to affect the outcome of this investigation.
What if you don't like what I find?
Just find the truth.
I am confident that that will exonerate Susie.
So, Susie's last case was a homicide.
The vic was stabbed
and bled out before the paramedics arrived.
The body was over by that dumpster.
What are we doing here?
Susie was killed 6 miles from this place.
Susie died one hour after she left this crime scene.
That gives her just enough time
to drop the evidence off at BPD and then drive home.
You think she was followed?
Well...even if she was guilty, Susie was smart.
She wouldn't want a criminal to know where she lived.
I mean, she had to have been followed from somewhere.
But there was no sign of forced entry.
A-and she never would've let someone in she didn't trust.
No.
And there was no record of a call to set up a meeting.
Well, unless she had a burner and they took that, too.
Janie, I-I don't want to believe that she was crooked.
Nobody does.
We don't have all the facts yet.
I know, but how many times
have we seen good people do bad things?
Come on.
Poor thing.
This is unbelievable.
It's just terrible.
Jane, come on. You can clear this up.
You know Susie didn't do those things.
It's complicated, ma.
You worked right next to her every day.
Don't you think you would've known?
I do.
Of course you would've.
She was your friend.
There's lots of stuff we don't know about our friends.
Even you?
There's a couple things you don't know about me.
Well, I could tell you a few things.
Yes, and I could tell you a few things
about this one, too.
It's not possible
that we could've been so wrong about Susie, is it?
Look, you two haven't had time to grieve.
Instead, you've been working this case.
You should be thinking about
all the things you did know about her,
like what was her favorite food?
Mint chocolate chip ice cream.
She kept a pint in the lab freezer.
Ice cream and lab tissues do not mix.
Well, did she have a pet?
Fluffy -- lizard.
Fluffy passed away two months ago.
Don't ask.
Well, what did she prefer -- socks or no socks?
Who cares?
Exactly.
You can know someone
without knowing every little detail about them.
Did you trust her?
Definitely.
Absolutely.
It's governor Holcomb.
This is Maura Isles.
Did you ever tell Maura about the junior prom disaster
with Benjy Schwartz?
No.
And you're not going to, either.
And if you do, I'll tell her about
your new year's eve 1999 fiasco.
You wouldn't.
Yes, I would.
No.
I'd make stuff up, too.
No, governor, I completely understand.
Okay. Goodbye.
What'd he want?
The governor is concerned about the fallout
from a scandal at the medical examiner's office.
He's hoping to get ahead of it
before the media gets ahold of the story.
Therefore, effective immediately,
I am suspended from duty.
You gave a full report of our investigation
to the governor's office?
Yeah.
They requested it last night, and I sent it over.
Maura got suspended because of that report.
I was doing my job -- by the book, as requested.
Now, did you need something?
Yeah, I needed the autopsy results,
and you haven't even started.
So, what -- so Maura puts you on an investigation,
now you're out to get her job?
That's brilliant, detective. You got me.
Here.
What is that?
The autopsy report that you requested.
2:37 A.M.
So, what? You were here all night?
Yeah.
Plotting my overthrow of Dr. Isles.
And going through the lab's recent cases
to find if any of them are missing any key evidence.
What'd you find?
Well, it's what I didn't find that's interesting.
Not one case -- Susie's or otherwise --
in the last six months is missing any of the evidence
that you found in Susie's apartment.
Well, then, where did it come from?
I'm afraid that's your job, detective.
Now, the autopsy did confirm that Susie died
from a massive blow to the back of the head.
Something -- something heavy,
Like a-a metal pipe or a tire iron.
I found some metal alloy in the cranial avulsions --
I'm sorry.
Just tell me.
I also found some odd lividity patterns --
subtle fluctuations in how the blood settled.
I think the body may have been compressed after death
for approximately an hour.
Compressed how?
Well, wrapped up --
in a-a tarp or plastic sheet of some kind.
Wait a minute. Are you saying that you think the body was moved?
Definite possibility.
Okay, this is good.
Um...sorry about the whole "You taking maura's job" thing.
I'm sorry -- what was that? I couldn't quite hear you.
Okay, you know what?
So, if the killer transported the body here,
They could've planted the cash and evidence we found.
Yeah, but they'd have to get the body inside
without any of the neighbors noticing.
Didn't you say that the garage footage was really dark, right?
Yeah.
All right.
What if Susie wasn't actually driving her car?
You think she was moved in her own vehicle?
I mean, you can see a driver, but you can't see who it is.
Well, there's a back stairway down here.
They could've taken her up that way.
Around midnight, when none of the neighbors would notice?
Well, if you're right,
the killer would've left on foot.
He would have wanted to ditch whatever he wrapped Susie in
right away so close.
Okay, I'll have CSRU come and process her car.
Yeah.
Hey! Stop! Stop that truck!
H-hey! Wait!
Boston police department!
How many trucks are working this area?
Three?
Well, get on the radio, tell them all to stop.
This whole area is a crime scene now.
Which one are you supposed to be -- starsky or hutch?
Did you find something?
No. But we're really close.
Maura, listen.
No.
You don't even know what I'm gonna say yet.
Jane, you're gonna ask me to look at something
to do with susie's case, and I can't --
not until she's officially cleared of any wrongdoing.
Maura, you know this suspension is ridiculous.
You don't think I want to help?
Jane, I can't risk it.
The reputation of the medical examiner's office
has to be above reproach.
What are you doing,
just sitting around the house doing nothing?
I am not sitting.
All right, well, find something to do, okay? Stay busy.
You and I do not do well on the sidelines.
I'll call you later.
Not until the governor lifts the suspension.
I know! I know. God.
Jane.
CSRU found a plastic tarp in a dumpster
a couple of blocks from Susie's apartment.
Are they sure it's connected to the case?
There was dried blood and hair inside.
Kent's processing the DNA now.
If Susie was transported to the apartment,
it probably means the whole crime scene was staged.
Somebody's going to a lot of trouble
to make Susie look dirty.
The lab confirmed that the DNA on the plastic tarp was a match.
Susie was definitely moved.
I knew she wasn't dirty.
Well, the killer wanted everybody to think she was.
We cross-indexed all Susie's cases
with her e-mails, phone calls, and lab requests
and then narrowed it down to all the ones
most likely to have been involved with her murder.
All right, everybody grab a stack.
We'll go through them individually.
So, Kent discovered additional fibers
inside the plastic lining?
A couple.
And these chemicals that Kent found on the fibers --
Does he have any theories on where they came from?
Well, he's working on it.
I'll just...hang on to this for a while.
You can't give it to Maura. She asked us to stay away.
I know.
Jane.
I'm not going to give it to Maura.
I promise.
Maura?
M-maura! Maura!
Honey, what's going on here?
Oh, well, I am taking Jane's advice.
I'm keeping busy.
I've been meaning to do a deep cleaning for months.
Oh, you're very thorough.
Did you hear the latest about Susie?
No.
Yeah, Jane found proof that she didn't do anything illegal.
Susie's clear.
Ohh! I am so relieved.
Me too.
So, now you can go back to work, right?
Well, we're gonna have to wait
for the governor to lift the suspension.
We can't afford anyone thinking that Susie's innocence
was somehow manufactured in order to avoid a scandal.
All right.
But, um...
Now that I'm here, maybe, um...
Maybe you could help me with something?
What do you think of, um...
Yeah --
Uh, pr-pro...pi...on...aldehyde?
I'm sorry?
Or, uh, methylanth-th-thracenes?
Anything weird about those...
Jane sent you.
Jane? No.
She wouldn't do that.
Maybe you could help me pick that up,
and, um, I'll finish the vacuuming.
Trivalent chromium.
What?!
Angela, you have to tell Jane --
Wait, wait, wait!
What?
You have to tell Jane to have the lab test
the trivalent chromium particles for azurite.
Also, see if they can detect heightened levels of
alicyclic C10 hydrocarbons.
Maybe you could just write that down?
Um, I-I heard you were a half-caff caramel macchiato man.
You didn't spit in it, did you?
Do I look like someone that would be that immatu--
Please don't answer that.
Can you tell me about the fibers you found on the plastic sheet?
Pigskin.
Due to the presence of trivalent chromium particles,
I would say it was from a leather product.
Susie wasn't wearing leather.
You think the fibers could've transferred from her killer?
Possibly.
Pigskin is used to make leather jackets and gloves.
But I couldn't confirm it.
There were traces of smoke residue also.
Could you, uh... run a couple of tests for me?
And what tests would these be?
Uh, check them for...
...azurite and alicyclic c10 hydrocarbons?
Why?
'Cause I said "Please."
You do know you didn't say "Please"?
Please.
Fine.
Thanks a lot.
Just as a matter of curiosity,
what does this murder have to do with a painting?
Who said anything about a painting?
Well, azurite is primarily used for blue pigment,
and those hydrocarbons are predominantly found in paint thinners.
Did you say that you found smoke residue?
It was in the report.
I need you to run those tests now.
Like, now now. Please.
Here's something -- rape case coming up for appeal next month.
Susie just completed the report
on new DNA evidence being used by the prosecution.
That's interesting. Let me see.
Forget about all those.
Where is Susie's file on the -- the painting forger?
Charlie Ganz?
Yes.
Charlie Ganz murdered that art thief
and then killed himself -- that case is closed.
Not officially. Susie was still making calls about it.
I think she ordered some new tests, too.
Who did she call?
Let me check.
Kent found smoke residue on those fibers,
and they have the same chemical components
as this burned painting.
The Thomas Moran painting?
Yes.
But the forger is the one who torched it
right before he killed himself.
We thought he torched it.
You think whoever burned that painting also killed Susie?
Yeah, and it wasn't Charlie Ganz,
'cause he was already dead.
Susie made three calls about this case
in the week before she died --
The Huntington Museum,
Mary Hope Langdon, the owner of the painting,
and a Dr. Kowalski at the BCU art-history department.
Okay, let's -- let's call all of them
and see what she wanted to talk about.
Susie was chasing a theory on this case.
Yeah, and it's that theory that got her killed.
The forger and the thief were both dead.
Everything wrapped up, neat and tidy.
But actually, there was a third person involved.
I'll run all their known associates,
see if anybody pops up.
That was Dr. Kowalski,
the art-history professor at BCU.
He said Susie contacted him because he specializes
in the Hudson River School of painters.
She wanted to know what kind of wood
Moran used to stretch his canvases,
which was mostly alder, but --
Jane.
I brought dinner... like we planned.
Right.
You got any extra? 'cause I'm starving.
Sorry. No.
Jane.
Right.
I hope this is something good.
I knew better than anyone how Susie thought,
how she processed things.
So I downloaded all of her work from the lab servers,
trying to figure out what she was doing.
Nice.
She was focused on the fire
that destroyed the Thomas Moran painting.
Focused how?
She sent everything recovered at the scene
back for additional analysis --
The metal backing wire, a small piece of the frame,
all of the ashes.
Did she find anything?
Traces of methylene chloride.
Which is...?
Methylene chloride is used to strip the paint off of old canvases.
Wait a minute.
So...the painting in the fireplace was stripped?
By a chemical that's only been around since the mid-1900s.
So the masterpiece in the fire...
Is simply another forgery.
Maybe it was a practice version of the one we found in the museum.
Well, then, everything has been staged --
The burning of the painting, Susie's death.
What do you want to bet that Charlie Ganz's suicide
wasn't real, either?
So somebody is tying up loose ends
with only one purpose in mind.
Yeah, so that no one knows
this $20 million painting still exists.
Okay.
But how would the killer know
that the M.E.'s office was still investing this?
All of these files are confidential.
Susie made a few calls last week.
So she may have tipped them off.
Yeah. Our killer is probably someone that she spoke to.
Thank you, Maura.
Detectives Korsak and Rizzoli to see secretary and Mrs. Langdon.
Open the gate. BPD is here.
Where did the wife's family get all her money?
Her family invented clothespins.
You're messing with me.
What, you think they invented themselves?
Thank you, Sandra.
I haven't talked to anyone from the police department --
not since I spoke with the two of you.
This would've been a woman
from the medical examiner's office -- Susie Chang.
Her records show a two-minute call
to your number four days ago.
Oh. This is the house line, not my cell.
I didn't take this call. Did you?
No. Anyone on the staff could've answered that.
I-I'm sorry. What exactly is it that you're hoping to discover here?
Well, we need to speak to whoever took that phone call.
Why?
With all due respect, Secretary Langdon,
we're investigating a homicide, so right now,
we're the ones asking the questions.
This Susie Chang -- she was the same woman
who was taking bribes, is she not?
Actually, no. She wasn't.
And that information hasn't been made public,
so how do you know about it?
Governor Holcomb told me,
and, frankly, I was outraged,
as every citizen in Massachusetts should be.
Sam.
No, Mary.
This is exactly the kind of corruption that we need to root out.
It's about time somebody held these agencies
to a higher standard.
Sam, please. You're not on the campaign trail.
Thank God.
Detective, what do you need from us?
We need to talk to everyone on staff
who might've answered that call.
Fine.
Sandra, can you gather everyone, please?
Can you excuse me? I need to take this.
Jane, I just heard from Agent Burns at the FBI.
He says the guy who wanted to purchase the Moran painting
got contacted about buying it three days ago.
Our killer's trying to unload it.
Did they get any information on the seller?
No names, but the seller did give the buyer a contact number.
I ran the number.
It goes to a prepaid cellphone, but it's not GPS-enabled.
So they can't get a location on it.
Not exact, but there were a few pings off
cell towers around Boston, so he's somewhere local.
Frankie, do me a favor.
Call that number.
Now?
Yeah, now.
It's ringing.
I got him.
Get on your knees! Put your hands behind your head!
Now!
I want a lawyer.
Doesn't look too shaken up, does he?
Smug bastard.
Turn off the cameras and give me 10 minutes alone with him,
he'll be shaken up.
We'll get him.
We don't have enough to put him away, and he knows it.
Nina's still digging.
She found an offshore account in his name.
It's got 100 grand in it.
You think he was paid to steal the painting?
I do.
Right now, all we've got is the cellphone he was carrying.
It ties him to the buyer but not the victims.
Frankie's back.
We'll get him.
Did you find anything in Ainsley's apartment?
Nothing -- no painting, no pigskin gloves,
no possible murder weapon.
Found something interesting.
Kirk Ainsley has worked for the Langdons
for almost eight years, but in his 20s,
he was an enlisted soldier in the army, rising to Sergeant.
So he has the skills to have pulled this off.
But here's the interesting part.
Guess who his commanding officer was.
Who?
Captain Samuel Langdon.
So he's used to taking orders from Langdon.
He owes him, too -- Langdon pulled Ainsley to safety
when an I.E.D. hit their squad in Iraq.
He saved Ainsley's life.
But that still doesn't explain
why Langdon would steal his own painting.
He's got plenty of money.
No, no, no. He doesn't have the money -- the wife does.
Has Langdon filed papers to run for next year's governor's race?
$20 million would make a nice campaign war chest.
And he could run the money through a PAC.
No one would know where it came from.
Langdon hasn't filed to run,
but he did form an Exploratory Committee.
So Langdon wants to be governor,
兰登试探竞选 为竞选州长成立试探委员会
but his rich wife isn't thrilled about it.
Maybe she won't bankroll him.
He recruits his old army buddy to help him steal a painting
his wife already owns.
We need to have another conversation with Secretary Langdon.
Well, Mary Hope is usually right about these things.
Detective Rizzoli, I was just saying
that I owe you two a huge apology.
I'm afraid that I let my enthusiasm
for improving our city get the best of me.
Well, thank you very much.
I apologize if I was out of line,
and I want to help this investigation
in any way that I can.
You can start by telling us about Kirk Ainsley.
Yes, particularly the part about you being
his commanding officer in the army.
Of course. Yeah.
That's what makes this such a shock.
I've known Kirk for years,
and I never, ever would've thought
that he'd be capable of doing something like this.
Except that --
Well, he may have murdered three people.
You need to tell us whatever you know.
Ainsley was a good soldier.
But he came back from Iraq...
changed.
Honestly, I've been worried about his mental health for a while now.
Well, we can understand
how this would be difficult for you.
Why don't you, uh... why don't you have a seat,
uh, while Detective Korsak takes your statement,
and I'll grab us some coffees.
Thank you.
Oh, and, uh, detective?
Yeah?
Cream, two sugars.
Of course.
Get up. We're taking a walk.
I'm not saying a word without a lawyer.
Good. All you got to do is listen.
Get up!
I know that Langdon paid you off.
And I'm sure he told you
he would take care of you no matter what,
get you the best lawyer money could buy.
Where is this lawyer?
Don't say a word.
Move.
And over the last few years,
Ainsley's become increasingly unhinged.
And where was it, again, you said
he might've hidden some evidence?
He has a small cabin off upper Mystic Lake.
It's not registered in his name.
I think it's on Old Pine Ridge Road.
You son of a bitch.
Ainsley?
It was your idea,
killing those people and planting that evidence.
What? That's -- that's absurd. - What do you want to know?
I'll give you enough to put this bastard away forever.
Clearly he's insane.
Oh, you lying sack of shit!
All right, all right.
All right, you want to do the honors?
With pleasure. You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
Dr. Isles.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
And thank you for stepping up the last few days.
Ah, I was just doing my job.
I hear they've recovered Mrs. Langdon's painting.
Yes.
But I doubt that she will ever look at it the same again.
Anyway, good night.
Oh, Kent, uh, a few of us
are going to the Dirty Robber after work --
just a small celebration of Susie's life.
Why don't you come?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Good.
Kent?
I think this is yours.
Ah. I was wondering where that got to.
Thanks.
Uh, I'll see you shortly.
Thank you all for coming.
We all know that Susie loved a party.
I knew the moment that I met Susie
that she was someone very special.
The second week she was at the lab,
we had a corpse arrive -- 700 bee stings.
Massive skin lesions, acute inflammation --
the point is, the next morning,
I came in to find Susie in the back,
covered from head to toe in a beekeeper's suit,
running tests on four different hives.
And I knew then that I had met a kindred spirit.
We will miss you.
To Susie.
To Susie!
In honor of one of our favorite science nerds,
I asked Nina to find something that Susie liked.
Were you able to find anything?
This is Susie's iPod --
the one she listened to when she was working in the lab.
Isn't that against regulations?
Oh, have a drink.
Shut up.
Please continue.
Well, there's one on here she played 468 times.
Must've been a brandenburg concerto.
There's nothing better to work to.
Or to fall asleep at your desk to.
Make me feel where you st--
You know the words?
Of course I do. Don't you? Come on!
