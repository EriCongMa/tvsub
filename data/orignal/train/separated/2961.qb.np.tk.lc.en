hey , guys .
hey .
honey , i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend .
that place in vermont ? you can take a hint .
you can &apos;t go away this weekend . it &apos;s emma &apos;s birthday .
we &apos;re having a party .
can &apos;t you have the party when we get back ?
no . it won &apos;t be her real birthday .
gee , if only she were 1 and had no idea what the hell a birthday was .
come on , you guys , this is really important to us .
sorry , but chandler and i could really use a weekend away ..
you know , to reconnect , emotionally .
there &apos;s this thing i really want us to do .
i read about it in maxim .
well , can &apos;t you just go to vermont the next day ?
yeah , we want everyone to be there .
as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister .
and , i mean , you know , you guys , this is a big deal .
how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle ?
i promise i won &apos;t do any magic .
all right , we &apos;ll stay . we can just drive up after the party .
fine . but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party ..
believe me , that is not why we won &apos;t be doing that .
the.one.with.the.cake
you know , phoebe , when i was little , on my birthday ..
my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house .
and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all .
i love family traditions like that .
when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday ..
our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food .
hey , guys .
hi .
i brought the camera for emma &apos;s video .
oh , good !
we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma ..
and we &apos;ll give it to her when she &apos;s 18 .
oh , cool .
wow , it &apos;s like a time capsule .
yeah .
oh , just think , she &apos;s gonna be watching that video on a tv ..
that hasn &apos;t even been invented yet ..
with friends who , right now , are just , like , babies .
and they &apos;ll be living in a floating city that the humans built ..
to escape the ant people .
that &apos;s the hope .
so is emma awake yet ?
no , it &apos;s still naptime .
but she &apos;ll be up soon .
where &apos;s joey ?
i said , it &apos;s still naptime .
hey , there &apos;s uncle joey .
hey .
hey , say something to emma on her 18th birthday .
eighteen , huh ?
joey , no !
what ? what ? it &apos;s for her hot friends .
when they see this , you &apos;ll be 52 .
and starting to think about settling down .
joey , will you please set this up for people to put emma &apos;s presents on ?
love to . yeah .
we were supposed to bring presents ?
yeah . i wrote emma a song .
oh , yeah . how was i supposed to know ?
joey , it &apos;s a birthday party .
yeah , but for a 1 @-@ year @-@ old .
what &apos;s the point ? the other day she laughed for an hour at a cup .
just a cup with a picture of elmo on it , dressed as a farmer .
and he &apos;s standing next to this cow , and the cow says , &quot; el @-@ moo . &quot;
man , that &apos;s a funny cup .
hey .
hey .
where &apos;s the birthday girl ?
oh , she &apos;s still napping .
she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening .
i know you guys really want to get to vermont , and this isn &apos;t a big deal to you .
but it really is to us , okay ? emma will never have a first birthday again .
you &apos;re right . we &apos;re sorry .
let &apos;s wake up emma and get the fun time started !
she didn &apos;t sleep well last night , so we can &apos;t wake her .
are you frigging kidding me , greene ?
hi !
hey !
i &apos;m so glad you came .
i can &apos;t believe emma &apos;s already 1 .
i remember your first birthday .
ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you .
he pulled on his testicles so hard ..
we had to take him to the emergency room .
there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t know about your dad .
hey , mr. and mrs. geller . let me help you with that .
thank you .
oh , man , this is great , huh ?
the three of us together again . you know what would be fun ?
if we gave this present to emma from all of us .
which one are you ?
i can &apos;t believe emma &apos;s still asleep .
i know . what are we gonna do ?
i &apos;ve got a plan . i &apos;ve got a plan .
i &apos;m going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs .
you &apos;re gonna scream out , and that &apos;ll wake her up .
i &apos;m not going to vermont with this monica .
hey , phoebe ? you know what ?
i was thinking since you wrote a song ..
maybe i could do something for emma using my talents .
so you &apos;re gonna hit on her ?
no , no , no . my talents as an actor .
you know , i could , like , maybe ..
i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books .
or you could stick a fork in an apple .
hey , i think emma might like it .
oh , emma might like what ?
my present .
what did you get her ?
we prepared performances .
separate performances .
but equally real .
that sounds like fun .
people are getting a little antsy waiting for emma to wake up from her nap .
so would you mind performing them once now ?
sure , yeah !
okay .
okay . all right . everybody , let &apos;s get this party started .
joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .
oh , great .
aren &apos;t you gonna be embarrassed having nothing prepared ?
i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting .
so , joey , what are you gonna do for us ?
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma &apos;s books .
oh , okay . which one ?
well , it &apos;s one of her favorites .
&quot; riding the storm out : coping with postpartum depression . &quot;
love you forever .
&quot; love you forever , by robert munsch . published by firefly books . printed ..
in mexico .
a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him ..
back and forth , back and forth , back and forth .
and while she held him , she sang , &apos; i &apos;ll love you forever .
i &apos;ll like you for always . as long as i &apos;m living ..
my baby you &apos;ll be . &apos; &quot;
&quot; and while he rocked her , he sang :
&apos;i &apos;ll love you forever . i &apos;ll like you for always .
as long as i &apos;m living ..
my baby you &apos;ll be . &apos; &quot;
oh , wow !
that was amazing .
thank you so much for that gift .
i was not ready for this today .
amazing . amazing .
phoebe , i &apos;m sorry .
phoebe has prepared something as well .
that &apos;s right .
i prepared a song for emma , from my heart to hers .
for there &apos;s no greater gift than the gift of music .
emma your name poses a dilemma
&apos;cause not much else rhymes with &quot; emma &quot;
maybe the actor richard crenna he played the commanding officer in rambo
happy birthday , emma
is that it ?
no , of course not .
no , i &apos;ve also , you know , prepared a reading .
&quot; sex and the single mother . &quot;
&quot; finding your g @-@ spot . &quot;
oh , no , no , no !
hello , emma . happy 18th birthday .
right now , that seems so far away , 17 years .
yes . you &apos;ll be all grown up by then , and we &apos;ll be ..
well , your grandfather and i might not be here .
that &apos;s true . this message
could be coming to you .. from beyond the grave , emma .
after all , my parents died very young .
and my cholesterol &apos;s off the charts .
remember , emma , heart disease kills women too .
okay , cut ! great . great . that was just ..
yeah .
oh , good .
ross , don &apos;t forget to get a shot of emma &apos;s cake .
it &apos;s in a box in the fridge .
okay , sure .
you &apos;re gonna love this cake . i got it from a bakery in new jersey , carino &apos;s .
oh , my god , that place has the creamiest frosting !
i used to hitchhike there when i was a kid .
well , anyway , they make these great novelty cakes ..
in all different shapes . and if you give them a photo , they &apos;ll copy it in icing .
did you do a picture of emma ?
yes . on a cake shaped like a bunny .
rach ? does this bakery by any chance also bake ..
erotic cakes ?
say , for bachelorette parties ?
ross , what are you talking .. ? oh , my god !
they put my baby &apos;s face on a penis !
now it &apos;s a party !
wait , you guys , this isn &apos;t funny .
if i wanted this cake to be a disaster , i would have baked it myself !
is it okay that i still think it looks delicious ?
jack , look at this .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , judy .
the resemblance is uncanny .
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .
ironically , that was the maxim thing .
no , no , this is not what i ordered , okay ?
i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake ..
for my daughter &apos;s birthday . and i need a bunny cake right now !
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby &apos;s face off the penis ..
so we could put it on the bunny .
that is a weird sentence .
oh , believe you me , i am going to bring this cake back .
i don &apos;t even want it in my home . don &apos;t touch it !
i &apos;m so confused !
yes , i still want my daughter &apos;s picture , but on a bunny cake !
yellow cake , chocolate frosting with nuts !
to be fair , this one does have nuts .
mon , it was nice of you to loan rachel your car ..
so she could get the cake .
it was nice of her to pull my hair ..
till i dropped the key .
well , while we &apos;re waiting , you could tape your message to emma ..
for her 18th birthday , huh ? okay ?
hi , emma . it &apos;s the year 2020 .
are you still enjoying your nap ?
we &apos;re aunt monica and uncle chandler , by the way .
you may not recognize us ..
because we haven &apos;t spoken to your parents in 17 years .
we used to be married .
but then we missed a weekend away together , and things kind of unraveled ..
because of you .
happy birthday .
thanks . another good one .
i can &apos;t believe i taped over my big brother audition for this .
ross , rachel promised it would be over by now .
we seriously have to go if we want to get to vermont .
the last train leaves in a half @-@ hour .
and i have a massage client soon .
you guys , just , please , a little bit longer .
i promise , rachel will be back with the cake any minute .
monica , remember the frosting , huh ?
all right , five more minutes .
hello ?
oh , no , what happened ?
okay , okay , where are you ?
okay , i &apos;ll be right there .
was that emma ? is she up ?
rachel got pulled over for speeding .
she forgot her license . i have to bring it to her .
if you &apos;re leaving , i &apos;m definitely going .
wait , if anybody gets to go , it &apos;s us !
we &apos;ve been complaining the longest !
no , wait , you guys . no , you can &apos;t leave .
rachel already feels bad that the cake &apos;s messed up .
how do you think she &apos;ll feel when she comes back and you &apos;re gone ?
i don &apos;t know . you &apos;ll tell us on monday .
joey , you &apos;re in charge , okay ? you make sure nobody leaves .
got it !
hey ! where do you think you &apos;re going ?
to the bathroom .
well , the rest of you get comfortable , because we are gonna be here for a ..
wait , there &apos;s a window in there .
no ! he &apos;s not getting away that easy !
what are you doing ? get the hell out of here !
well , that one did not have emma &apos;s face on it .
no , it did not .
no .
well , we &apos;d better get going . it &apos;s late .
jack can &apos;t drive at night anymore . he has trouble staying in his lane .
last winter i went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene .
the papers thought it was a hate crime .
anyway , it was lovely seeing you .
okay .
bye . bye , dear .
nighty @-@ night .
nighty @-@ night .
bye .
how could you just let them leave ?
hey , hey , hey .
i &apos;m not gonna mess with jack . he &apos;s a great man . he fought for our country .
no , he didn &apos;t . he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea .
well , that &apos;s it . he &apos;s the last one to go . i &apos;m locking you guys in .
you do know i can just turn them the other way around , right ?
oh , i forgot you used to live here .
hello ?
joey , it &apos;s estelle .
hey .
so how &apos;d your audition go today ?
what audition ?
the one i told you about last week .
what ? you never said anything about an audition .
let me start over . i just got a call about an audition .
i think you can still make it .
it &apos;s down at the astor theater , and you need to have a monologue prepared .
a monologue ? i don &apos;t have a ..
i got it .
so i &apos;m gonna take off .
what ?
no , wait ! you don &apos;t get to leave .
i &apos;ve got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute .
and we paid for a room that we &apos;re supposed to be in right now !
well , okay , now ..
only one of us has to stay with emma .
okay , and as the person who realized that , i get to go .
no , no , no . no . no .
let &apos;s figure out a fair way to decide who &apos;s staying .
oh , i got it .
okay , everyone pick a number from one to 10 , all right ?
whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .
okay , 10 .
okay , monica picks 10 . i call nine .
anyone else ?
no , let &apos;s just draw straws .
okay .
or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer ..
i &apos;m begging you to stop .
right .
okay , how about this ? we got wind @-@ up toys for emma .
we can make them race , and whoever comes in last stays .
yeah , let &apos;s do that !
that sounds more fun than the thing we were gonna do in vermont !
okay , everybody , pick your toys !
okay . i want the dolphin !
that &apos;s a bear !
i &apos;m too excited !
phoebe , you get the bear . joey , you get the robot .
oh , yeah .
and chandler and i get the dog .
and the race is going to go from here to here .
now , the one who comes in last stays !
okay , ladies and gentlemen , wind your toys .
okay . on your mark , get set , go !
go ! go !
come on , robot !
what are you barking at ?
well , how is that gonna help ?
i bought you ! how did i forget that that &apos;s all you do ?
way to go , robot !
good job , alan .
hey , good race , you guys .
yeah , see you later .
no . no , no . wait .
we didn &apos;t lose .
the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser .
well , our dog never crossed the finish line . so technically ..
they left .
there isn &apos;t time to go to the bakery . we &apos;re gonna come home .
everybody left ?
all right . well , just tell emma that we &apos;ll be there as soon as we can . bye .
rachel !
oh , god , sorry !
i can &apos;t believe they gave you a ticket . you &apos;re such a good driver .
emma &apos;s awake .
yeah ?
i can &apos;t believe this .
this is her first birthday , she &apos;s awake , we &apos;re not even there .
everybody left . we still have this stupid obscene cake .
hey , maybe i can fix that . you know , try to turn it into something else .
oh , don &apos;t even bother .
we &apos;ve already ruined her first birthday .
and do you know how important these early experiences are , ross ? very !
according to the back cover of that book that you gave me .
rach , she &apos;s not gonna remember this .
i guess .
oh , i just had such an idea of what this day would be like , you know ?
emma laughing ..
and everybody gathered around her cake , singing &quot; happy birthday . &quot;
and then we would all .. hey , get out of the road , you stupid student driver !
they have to learn .
hey .
what ?
this is not bad .
oh , my god . look , you made it into a bunny . how did you do that ?
well , i just made these two things cheeks .
and then i split this to make ears .
well , i am very impressed .
some can sing , some can dance .
i , apparently , can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures .
now , another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size .
i &apos;m sorry , is this a game for emma or for monica ?
game ?
emma , do you even know it &apos;s your birthday today ? you &apos;re 1 .
one year old . that &apos;s little .
that &apos;s my girl .
that &apos;s how old you are .
did i teach her that ? did i just impart wisdom ?
i want one .
me too .
there &apos;s no one around . why don &apos;t we just take this one ?
and head to canada .
i was kidding .
i wasn &apos;t . let &apos;s get going .
hey , are ross and rachel back ?
no , not yet .
oh , good , i didn &apos;t miss the party .
what about your massage client ?
i just felt so bad missing this . so i just slipped him a little something , you know .
as long as i &apos;m back in five or six hours , it &apos;ll be all right .
okay .
if ross and rachel ask , i &apos;ve been here the whole time . the whole time .
i &apos;ve been here the whole time .
joey , we just saw you come in . you ran past us on the stairs .
i don &apos;t care that you left . i &apos;m just glad that you &apos;re here . thanks , you guys .
hey , guys , come on . you gotta see what emma just did .
what ?
emma , how old are you ?
how old are you today ?
emma , that &apos;s right . you &apos;re that many .
oh , my god , our daughter &apos;s a genius .
this means ..
no ! no science camp !
damn it ! i &apos;ll put a candle on the cake .
oh , and , emma , look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly .
thanks .
okay , here we go .
emma &apos;s first birthday cake .
go ahead , emma , blow out the candle .
come on , emma . you can do it .
what &apos;s wrong ? are you okay ?
oh , yeah , nothing .
these are happy tears .
this is just what i wanted .
hey , you made it into a bunny .
what is wrong with me ? it looked more delicious when it was a penis .
okay , you ready ?
yeah .
and record .
okay .
big brother audition . take one .
i guess you could say i &apos;m kind of a player .
okay . let &apos;s ..
let &apos;s just try that again .
okay .
hi , emma . well , your first birthday is over , and ..
go ! go ! come on !
go ! go ! come on !
