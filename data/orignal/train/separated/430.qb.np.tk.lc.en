criminal minds s07e02
guess who i went to second base with .
who , cy ?
lyla smith .
bull !
get back here ! why don &apos;t you believe me ?
because you lie !
i grew up normal ,
in a normal house ,
the size of a castle .
i played sports ...
sang in the choir ,
for the president of the united states ...
and celebrated my birthdays with 4 @-@ story cakes ,
flown straight from paris .
my brother and i played kickball over there .
and--and here is where we would hide from the police
after stealing magic potions from the toy store .
i don &apos;t know why they wouldn &apos;t believe me
when i told them we were gonna make things with it .
i still build things now .
i--i took apart a 1961 desoto ,
and built a generator from scratch .
it &apos;s so powerful ,
it could light a springsteen concert .
but for now , it just lights my room .
what are you-- what are you doing ?
i don &apos;t understand .
i &apos;ll do anything . please , don &apos;t hurt me .
why would i hurt you ?
no , no , no , no , no , no !
so you finished the course ?
and completed my case rotation .
hotch says he &apos;s never seen a rookie profiler
analyze and write up cases as well as you .
he said that ?
yeah . well , after all the cases you presented
over the years , i &apos;m not surprised .
hey , where have you been ? i wanted to do brunch this weekend .
i had to deal with some stuff with my mom .
have you seen garcia ?
uh , she &apos;s with rossi .
he hates me .
mm , he was just busy .
let it go .
ok , you can be honest . i can take it .
ok . i prefer my pasta al dente ,
and the pancetta was a little weird .
oh . that &apos;s &apos; cause it &apos;s tofu .
tofu ? i give you my recipe and you do an improv ?
no , no , i followed it down to the micron , aside from the pig .
look , master of all things italian ,
i am having a fellini festival at my house this weekend
and i must serve the beautiful food of his country .
maybe you should show a disney film and stick with burgers .
you know , rossi , you could always give penelope a cooking lesson .
oh , my gosh , that would be amazing .
that would be like--
that would be like the iron chef meets the bau .
and we could do it at your house .
i don &apos;t have a house ,
i have a mansion .
all right , let &apos;s get started .
all right , mes amis .
you are jetting to durant , oklahoma ,
because in the last 3 days ,
two women have been found dead
after being sexually tortured
and then blinded with a sulfuric acid solution .
abby elcott is our first victim ,
19 @-@ year @-@ old art student .
she was headed to campus for an advanced drawing class .
she &apos;d been missing for two days .
same goes for our second victim , beth westerly , 17 .
she had just finished her coffee shop shift
and was on her way to a bar method class .
both low @-@ risk victims .
and physically similar .
how close are the two abduction sites ?
5 miles apart at bus stops .
abby &apos;s cell was found near one ,
beth &apos;s scarf near the other .
where are the dump sites ?
one in an alley , the other in a field .
so he stapled their eyes open ,
then he blinded them .
it &apos;s about power and control .
maybe he didn &apos;t to want them to watch while he hurt them .
or it could be about shame .
perhaps the unsub is disfigured himself .
blinding the victims leaves them helpless ,
lost , totally dependent .
it may be a manifestation of how he sees himself in this world .
it is a form of enucleation , just without the scalpel .
his face is the last they see before darkness .
garcia , come up with a list of jobs
that would give the unsub access to sulfuric acid .
the rest of us , wheels up in 30 minutes .
and this is where my brother lives now .
there you are , cy .
i got you clothes .
bought you some shampoo and toothpaste .
see ? we &apos;re the perfect american story .
yeah , yeah , yeah , ok . turn that thing off , come on in .
come on .
every story has a beginning .
but the part i like best
is the end .
&quot; if it is a miracle ,
&quot; any sort of evidence will answer .
but if it is a fact , proof is necessary . &quot;
mark twain .
victimology is very similar .
blond @-@ haired , blue @-@ eyed teenage girls .
we believe they were each abducted
near public transportation stops .
when was this photo taken ?
beth was caught on a bank surveillance camera
3 hours before she disappeared .
that &apos;s a recent photo of abby .
so she wasn &apos;t found in the same clothes
she was abducted in .
maybe he changed them
because hers were burned by the sulfuric acid .
it &apos;s possible . sulfuric acid can turn human flesh into soap .
garcia , any recent similar cases in the surrounding area ?
actually , yes . two months ago
a prostitute and a runaway were both found
raped and killed and they had stab wounds to their eyes .
so maybe he practiced on high @-@ risk victims first .
and then advanced to chemical enucleation .
isn &apos;t that a rare paraphilia ?
well , the chemical part is . it would exacerbate the pain .
like ed kemper , he &apos;s probably practicing on surrogates
before going after the real object of his rage .
dave , you and i will talk to the parents .
morgan and prentiss , go to the disposal sites .
jj , you and reid to the abduction sites .
so beth got off the bus here
and headed northwest toward class .
it &apos;s amazing no one witnessed her abduction .
emily was buried 6 feet under and wound up in paris ,
so i guess anything &apos;s possible , right ?
so that is what this is about .
maybe our unsub &apos;s a little bit like bundy .
he feigns injury in order to get her to help him .
look , spence , if you want to talk about this--
maybe he tried other tactics , like , &quot; wow , you &apos;re really pretty .
&quot; you should be a model . i can take your photo .
i &apos;ll take that as a no .
either one would disarm her .
charm is quite the killer .
so are tears . whatever his ruse was ,
the unsub mostly likely used it to get her into his vehicle .
well , if abby was last seen at a bus stop a few miles away ,
then he definitely has a means of transportation .
hopefully the disposal site will tell us more .
so what do you have , detective bonner ?
beth &apos;s body was found over there .
you smell the urine ?
i thought that was air freshener .
there &apos;s drugstore food everywhere .
it &apos;s a homeless corridor .
abby was found in a shantytown as well .
so , our unsub hunts and travels
through the areas unnoticed ,
blending in with his surroundings .
this guy &apos;s either homeless or appears to be .
he most likely has a car ,
to get them from the abduction site to here .
just because you &apos;re homeless doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re carless .
it could explain why he chose high @-@ risk victims at first .
they were all around him .
he had her for two days ?
i can &apos;t even imagine what she went through .
why did he blind her ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
i know this is difficult ,
but i need you to look at the clothes that abby was wearing
when we found her .
do you recognize them ?
do you find anything odd
about beth &apos;s clothing ?
they &apos;re not abby &apos;s .
you sure ?
i saw her that morning .
she had on a brown and pink sweater .
beth wouldn &apos;t wear denim shorts .
they aren &apos;t her style .
you &apos;re sure ?
in addition to the blinding ,
taking their clothes further robs them of their identity .
he &apos;s either keeping their garments as souvenirs
or re @-@ dressing the victims as a forensic countermeasure .
dressing them in these outfits could be part of the fantasy .
where do homeless people get their clothes ?
churches , thrift stores . we need to rule everything out .
i &apos;m a plane ! i &apos;m a plane !
you are now entering dallas international airport .
please hold on to your flotation device
and fasten your seatbelts !
cy , your stuff is right there .
oh , minty fresh . i like minty fresh .
we keep buying you toothbrushes ,
but you clearly aren &apos;t using them .
instead of crashing here every now and again ,
why don &apos;t you just move in ?
i like to be free .
last night i had a date with two hot twins .
is that so ?
why don &apos;t you believe me ?
remember when he said he dated cyndi lauper in high school ?
i did , i did , i did !
how many times do i have to tell you ?
a million , &apos; cause you always lie .
hey , guys .
hi . hey , uncle cy .
tammy , how was practice ?
i hit two home runs .
hey , mom , what &apos;s the deal with my dress ?
on your bed .
really ?
where &apos;s she going ?
homecoming &apos;s tomorrow night .
i loved homecoming .
well , we &apos;ll be taking pictures before she leaves .
why don &apos;t you stop by ?
oh , and maybe i could tape it .
no , that &apos;s ok , cy . you don &apos;t have to .
why not ? it &apos;ll be fun .
no , no , no . what would be fun
would be if you and i take a break .
i can see the doctor &apos;s working .
counseling &apos;s worth every penny .
excuse me .
do you know where church street is ?
uh , you &apos;re on church street .
i am ?
see ... you &apos;re standing right here .
just walk . just walk . come on .
this way . come on .
reid and jj went to the
local thrift shop and found abby &apos;s clothes .
so he sold them .
or traded them for the eighties clothing .
the sales clerk said the clothes in the crime scene photos
were of that time period , and he confirmed
that they were purchased from his store .
so if he &apos;s getting rid of his souvenirs .
what &apos;s he using to remember his victims ?
and why is he fixated on this era ?
what do you got ?
the brutality the victims experienced was immense .
multiple stab wounds to the neck and chest ,
plus wounds to the genital .
frustration and overkill .
the same chemical damage on the skin
is also around her nostrils .
he poured the sulfuric acid there as well .
and that would destroy their sense of smell , yes ?
absolutely .
he didn &apos;t do that to the first victim .
no , he &apos;s escalating .
and blinding isn &apos;t his only signature .
no , he &apos;s trying to take away their senses .
i like when women scream .
it reminds me of the roller coaster .
i like roller coasters .
especially in the summertime .
somebody please help me !
somebody !
what ? you don &apos;t like the way i taste ? !
no !
well , i can help you with that .
please , please ...
somebody help me !
somebody please help me !
no , no . no ...
again he &apos;s disposing in an area frequented by homeless people .
it &apos;s equidistant to the last two dump sites .
he burned her tongue with the chemical this time .
so he removed her ability to taste .
why would he do that ?
historically this kind of torture was used
to prevent someone from revealing a secret .
maybe she offended him .
i wonder what that &apos;s like .
her lips are extremely chapped .
she was probably forced to repeatedly participate
in some sort of kissing fantasy .
and when things go awry , he takes the offending sense away .
he tortured her in these clothes , which means the eighties
are essential to his delusion .
maybe that &apos;s when this rejection occurred
and he held on to the clothes all these years .
and now he &apos;s attacking
girls who remind him of women from that time .
he &apos;s fixated on her type
and remakes them fit his fantasy .
but why start now ?
something probably triggered it ,
and instead of dealing with it , he &apos;s acting out .
we believe the unsub or unknown subject that we &apos;re looking for
is a white male in his 40s .
this is someone who &apos;s reacting to rejection by a woman
when he was teenager in the 1980s .
he &apos;s punishing his victims for their reactions to him
by taking away their senses with sulfuric acid .
we believe our unsub could possibly work part @-@ time
as a janitor or a mechanic ,
which would give him access to this chemical .
and after studying the disposal sites ,
we think it &apos;s likely that he is homeless .
now , how do we typically react toward the homeless ?
we judge them by their looks and smells .
it &apos;s that same negative reaction
we believe that a woman had
toward the unsub at some point in the eighties .
the unsub &apos;s fixation on this woman is now all @-@ consuming .
it &apos;s caused him to develop obsessive love disorder .
he most likely has tunnel vision
and believes that she holds the key to his happiness .
he will stalk her in an attempt to win her back .
he will do whatever it takes to be near his love interest .
but her rejection will spiral him into a depression .
which would lead to rape and murder
of the surrogates who represent her .
and it &apos;s only a matter of time
before this rage and anger causes the unsub
to go after her directly .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s fight , let &apos;s win tonight !
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s fight , let &apos;s win tonight !
lyla ?
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s fight , let &apos;s win tonight !
you &apos;ve got to be kidding !
give me a break , cy .
leave me alone , matt !
tammy ?
hello !
spence . look , we gotta talk about this .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
i get it , ok ? you &apos;re disappointed
with the way we handled emily .
listen , i have a lot going on , all right ?
you know what i think it is ?
what ?
you &apos;re mad that hotch and i controlled our micro @-@ expressions
at the hospital and you weren &apos;t able to detect our deception .
you think it &apos;s about my profiling skills ?
jennifer , listen , the only reason
you were able to manage my perceptions
is because i trusted you . i came to your house
for 10 weeks in a row crying over losing a friend ,
and not once did you have the decency to tell me the truth .
i couldn &apos;t .
you couldn &apos;t ? or you wouldn &apos;t ?
no , i couldn &apos;t .
what if i started taking dilaudid again ?
would you have let me ?
you didn &apos;t .
yeah , but i thought about it .
spence .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s too late , all right ?
reid .
oh , cy , why don &apos;t you just crash here ?
i may for a bit .
you know , if mom and dad were alive , they &apos;d make you .
you ought to try and have a nice life .
i have a nice life .
when things get bad , i go out on this ship made of clay .
of clay , cy ?
last night i took another girl out on it .
yeah ? when can we meet her ?
never .
she &apos;s dead to me .
what do you think ?
i lightened my hair in your honor , mom .
oh , my , you &apos;re beautiful !
where &apos;s the camera ?
you look just like your mom did in high school .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m wearing the same dress .
mom cut it shorter .
so , can i stay out till 2 : 00 ?
nice try . you can go to the dance
and then the party at the motel ,
but debbie &apos;s mom &apos;s picking you up at midnight .
ok .
ok .
have fun .
thank you .
it would have had to have been a woman very close to the unsub
to make him react this way .
then why go after surrogates ?
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re dealing with a typical homeless person .
he &apos;s good with chemicals , owns a car .
i think the only mistake in our profile
was assuming there was
something wrong with his physical composition ,
reducing him to some sort of stereotype .
you think it &apos;s only his mental state ?
i think this guy might be smart enough to use his disability
to his advantage so he comes across as harmless .
then when he &apos;s alone and the victim rejects him , he goes off .
what if he doesn &apos;t live on the street ?
what if he &apos;s in a halfway house ?
garcia , i need a list of halfway houses
and mental health centers in the unsub &apos;s comfort zone .
ok . 5 are being sent to your phones .
which of those were around in the eighties , garcia ?
there are two in your area .
morgan and prentiss , take the first .
dave and i will take the second .
what about us ?
stay here and check vicap for similar m.o.s and signatures .
reid .
if you want to be mad at someone , be mad at me .
i can &apos;t . i didn &apos;t come to your house crying for 10 weeks .
i &apos;ve worked here over 15 years .
there are many people who fit that description .
this guy would be mobile , probably early 40s .
well , if he &apos;s got a car ,
then he &apos;s transitioned out in the last few years .
state budget cuts .
all right , we &apos;ll need a list of those names .
it ain &apos;t gonna be small .
hey , morgan .
what do i do about reid ?
emily , there &apos;s a lot about you being back that &apos;s unresolved .
are you pissed at me , too ?
come on , now .
how can i be ? you &apos;re here .
thank you .
because i know what you went through .
grief counseling . you carried my coffin .
yeah , i sure did . what was in that thing , anyway ?
i don &apos;t know .
here you go .
thank you very much .
look ,
just give reid some time .
he &apos;ll be fine .
thanks .
yeah , hotch , it &apos;s me , morgan . listen ,
19 people entered this house in the eighties
who were let out in the last 5 years .
we got 11 from the one we visited .
send your names to garcia . have her cross @-@ check them
against jobs that use sulfuric acid .
all right . we &apos;ll start reaching out to the extended families .
ok .
how &apos;s reid ?
he &apos;s angry and frustrated .
i &apos;m surprised everybody isn &apos;t .
some of us had an inkling .
what ? i &apos;m good at what i do .
so , are you gonna get psychological counseling for the team
or handle it internally ?
no , i think that if we all just got together ,
maybe a cooking lesson and
at the home of one of one of our founders--
oh , no , not you , too .
it could boost morale .
is this an order ?
no , it &apos;s just a-- it &apos;s a very tempered suggestion .
tempered suggestion .
hey , you all right ?
yeah . thanks , debbie . i just--
i just need a minute .
tammy ?
uncle cy ?
what are you doing here ?
i--i was just going to buy some beer .
you ok ?
no .
maybe i should take you home .
i don &apos;t want to get in trouble with mom and dad .
you won &apos;t .
i &apos;ll take care of you .
so we interviewed the 19 people released from the group home .
none of them fit the profile .
dave &apos;s still trying to locate the families .
tammy bradstone &apos;s parents just filed a report .
their daughter didn &apos;t return from homecoming last night .
her face is similar to our 3 vics .
she &apos;s about the same age .
well , the after party where she was last seen
was smack in the comfort zone .
where are her parents now ?
they &apos;re at the house .
we &apos;re bringing her friends in for questioning .
you head over there . we &apos;ll start the interviews here .
i see on the news on the tv ,
people question ,
they question why people do this .
it &apos;s the same reason people do anything .
&apos;cause they feel like it . they like the way it feels .
when i was kid , my dog poppy running across the grass ,
when i hit her , i liked that feeling .
that has not changed .
somebody help me !
help !
uncle cy ?
what &apos;s happening ?
what did you do to me ?
so kids spill out of the motel toward the cars .
if tammy walked this way ,
how could she disappear without anyone seeing her ?
someone would have heard her scream .
that &apos;s if she screamed .
unlike the last 3 abduction sites ,
this one is nowhere near public transportation .
maybe she knew the unsub .
or thought she did .
what if--what if tammy was the target all along ?
that would explain the change in the m.o.
so whoever did this knew she was coming here .
hi , hi , hi .
hey , baby girl , i need you to work that magic for me .
anything , my sweetest .
i just opened up tammy bradstone &apos;s computer .
i want you to check her emails , web searches ,
and anyone she may have skyped .
ok , typing at the speed of thought .
thanks , mama .
are you gonna find my sister ?
we &apos;re gonna try , little man .
listen , uh , did your sister dye her hair recently ?
yeah . to look nice for the homecoming dance .
she was even gonna wear the same dress my mom did .
are you sure that tammy hasn &apos;t been behaving differently lately ?
she &apos;s 16 , so she &apos;s pretty closed off .
your daughter seems to cherish hanging out in groups ,
so there &apos;s no way she would run off with someone unless she knew them .
what about her computer ?
nothing out of the ordinary , and hotch cleared the boyfriend .
do you know anyone who is transient or mentally ill ?
uh , yeah , my brother .
he didn &apos;t get enough oxygen to his brain when he was born .
what &apos;s his name ?
cy bradstone .
on the halfway house list ,
all i got was a ben bradstone .
oh , no , yeah , that &apos;s his real name .
cy is the name he made up .
where does he live ?
he crashes here from time to time , but he &apos;s basically homeless .
his frontal lobe damage
is one of the indicators of serial killers .
cy isn &apos;t a serial killer .
he wouldn &apos;t hurt anybody , especially not my daughter .
come on .
come on !
just a little bit further .
i want to tell you a story .
has cy ever acted inappropriately toward tammy ?
no . i wouldn &apos;t let him in here if he had .
ok , so he sleeps here sometimes ,
and his head is on this side .
that puts the tv out of his sight .
since when is that a crime ?
well , it just gives him a full view of the kitchen .
does tammy cook for him ?
no . lyla does .
ma &apos;am , what &apos;s your relationship with cy ?
i &apos;ve known him since 10th grade .
that was 1985 .
he makes you uncomfortable , doesn &apos;t he ?
did you have blond hair in high school ?
yes . what are you getting at ?
sir , your daughter just dyed her hair blond .
you allowed her to wear your dress .
i &apos;m just thinking it may have triggered something for cy .
what happened with you and cy
that made him so angry ?
honey , what is it ?
when i was 16,
my friends and i went to a party after homecoming .
everyone had been drinking .
damn . i &apos;m seeing stars .
let &apos;s play spin the bottle .
when it was your mom &apos;s turn ,
she spun it and it landed on me .
you should have seen her face .
she lit up like-- like a lite brite .
i didn &apos;t know what to do .
my friends laughed ,
but i didn &apos;t want to be mean , so i ...
went in the closet with him .
and what happened next ?
i let him feel me up .
how did he behave after that ?
he started following me around at school .
then one day he overheard me tell a friend
how gross i thought he was .
how he talked , how he smelled ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
i was 16 .
we had just started dating .
does cy know about your recent marital problems ?
i told him a couple months ago .
and then he probably started making advances towards you ,
which you had to reject .
that &apos;s what triggered the killings .
i did this ?
no . no , ma &apos;am .
the events did .
does cy have a part @-@ time job ?
yeah , he works at a couple garages .
one on drake , the other on fourth .
that explains the sulfuric acid .
we &apos;ll need those addresses .
ok . excuse me .
ok , so , as long as tammy doesn &apos;t do anything to antagonize him ,
we may have a chance .
oh , my god .
it &apos;s you !
you &apos;re the one that my mom told me about .
uh @-@ huh . yes .
you took advantage of her
when she was drunk at a party .
no , that &apos;s--that &apos;s not true .
yes .
that &apos;s probably why she won &apos;t touch you now .
that &apos;s why she won &apos;t touch me ?
yeah . because you forced yourself on her .
you shouldn &apos;t have done that , tammy .
you should have kept your mouth shut !
you won &apos;t get away with this , uncle cy .
they &apos;ll find you .
they can &apos;t find me , tammy .
they &apos;re not looking for me .
when cy comes to the house ,
he gets out of the car
and he goes to the door .
yeah .
how do you know he &apos;s here ?
i can hear his truck .
so then you head to the front door .
yes .
there you are , cy .
when you open it , what do you smell ?
he smells musty , like he needs to take a shower .
are you sure that &apos;s all you smell ?
i smell chemicals .
he smells like chemicals .
what does he do next ?
he crushes a cup , and-- and he puts it in his bag .
where &apos;s it from ? is there a name on the cup ?
it &apos;s a soda from a coffee shop .
the way station .
it &apos;s down the street .
ok . he probably stops there every time he comes here .
what days would those be ?
monday , wednesday , and friday . sometimes saturday .
which means he &apos;d be coming today .
i need you to leave a message for him there .
i &apos;m going to go get us something to eat .
don &apos;t worry , tammy .
there are other sports to play .
any luck ?
he hasn &apos;t been to either of the mechanics &apos; shops in the past two months .
but the one on fourth said a bunch of car batteries had gone missing .
wait--
yeah ?
morgan , it &apos;s from a pay phone near a coffee shop .
it &apos;s him .
ok , go ahead . just like we talked about .
hello ?
hi , it &apos;s cy .
paulie said you were looking for me .
lyla , what &apos;s wrong , lyla ?
matt got arrested .
what ? lyla , what are you talking about ?
they think that he hurt tammy .
oh , god , cy .
i need you .
don &apos;t--don &apos;t cry .
lyla , don &apos;t--don &apos;t cry .
everything &apos;s gonna be all right .
i just--i--i need you to , uh , come over here and--
i need you to talk . i need you to hold me .
you--you do ?
yes . i--
hurry . i have no one else to turn to .
i &apos;ll be there , lyla . i &apos;ll be there .
he &apos;s coming .
you and prentiss stay with them .
morgan and i will get the front .
lyla !
lyla .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
cy bradstone ! fbi ! put your hands where i can see them !
let me see your hands !
on your knees , now !
how could you do this to me ?
get up .
how could you do this to me ? !
stop moving . stop it !
we need to know where tammy is , cy .
we &apos;ve looked in your car . there &apos;s no sign of her .
we know this isn &apos;t about tammy .
this is about your love for lyla .
lyla ?
lie @-@ la !
you and lyla had a pretty good secret all these years .
how &apos;d she get you to shut up about it ?
one time .
that &apos;s all i needed .
is that where you , uh , did it , cy ?
is that the same place you took tammy ?
we know when you saw her in that dress ,
it made you think of lyla .
tammy &apos;s not the one you want to hurt , cy .
lyla &apos;s the one that should be punished .
she &apos;s the one who made you feel like a freak .
a reject , a weirdo .
tell us where tammy is , cy , and we can be done .
done ?
finished .
finished ?
well , i can--i can do that .
under one condition .
now , where &apos;s tammy , cy ?
what did you do with my daughter ?
lyla was an angel .
like--like a prize in the crackerjack box .
when she would come into the room , my heart would race .
when i saw tammy in that dress ,
it took me back there .
cy , just tell me where she is .
i took her . we did things .
everything was going good un @-@ until she said those words .
what did she say , cy ?
she said ...
she said the reason her mother always backed up when i came over
was because she didn &apos;t want to feel me touching her .
so guess what i did , matt .
you guess !
what did you do , cy ?
i made it so she couldn &apos;t feel either .
she screamed so loud .
but no one could hear her .
where do you have her ?
the same place i told him about my love .
guess who i went to second base with .
who , cy ?
lyla smith .
bull !
get back here .
why don &apos;t you believe me ?
because you lie !
you never told me that .
yes , i did , yes , i did , yes , i did !
but you thought i was lying and then you married my girl !
so this is what you do , cy ? why didn &apos;t you just hurt me ?
i take away your senses , matt .
the last one is hearing .
and if i take that ,
you wouldn &apos;t be able to listen to what i did to her .
you son of a bitch ! you taped-- you taped my daughter ? !
you son of a bitch ! you son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
clear !
she &apos;s got a pulse . i need a medic in here !
oh , jeez .

&quot; nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge . &quot;
so , the surgeon said he believes
he can restore feeling to tammy &apos;s hands .
good . we got there in time .
i heard mr. bradstone wants to watch the tape .
people have an innate
curiosity to see things in order to confirm them .
oh , that explains why i &apos;m going to rossi &apos;s tomorrow night .
i want to see if he really can cook .
you coming ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m not so sure i can make it .
look , reid , i know you &apos;re mad at us
because we didn &apos;t tell you what really happened ,
and i understand that .
but i promise you , we had no choice .
you mourned the loss of a friend .
i mourned the loss of 6 .
this whole thing gave me an ulcer .
please don &apos;t give me another one .
are you gonna go to rossi &apos;s tomorrow ?
we &apos;ll see .
now , matt , you might not want to watch this .
but this is what i &apos;m going to do to your daughter .
but what i did with your wife ,
now , that &apos;s a tape you should see .
cooking is the most sensual art form .
and these are my paints .
so your hands must be brushes .
don &apos;t interrupt .
in a pot of boiling water we cook our spaghetti
until it &apos;s al dente , firm to the tooth .
here you go . everybody pass it around .
see ? feel the texture . there we go . ok .
now ...
in a large pan ,
we fry up our pancetta .
keeping a sharp eye that the edges are crisp .
but careful not to burn the onions .
bravo , aaron !
we saute until translucence .
uh--i got it .
grazie mille .
now , we mix in the eggs ...
the parmesan ...
the spaghett ...
and parsley .
you see , it &apos;s all about timing and rhythm .
and if you don &apos;t feel yourself doing it properly ,
please , order a pizza .
sorry i &apos;m late .
yeah . and this is why i cook alone .
so , uh , when do we get to drink the wine ?
almost there .
ok . we start at the beginning .
you eat what you cook ,
i &apos;ll supervise ,
but we &apos;re gonna do this all together ,
just like a family .
ok now ?
now .
