mom ?
mom ! somebody ! help her !
mom !
all right . fighting stance . nice .
he &apos;s coming at me . all right ?
boom ! right in the eyes .
well , that can do serious damage to the cornea .
this is my thought , yes .
you know , i just -- i &apos;d feel a little better
with a j-- a @-@ a jab , jab , hook ,
like i do in my boxing class .
yes , uh , you know ,
but by the time you &apos;ve said , &quot; jab , &quot;
the rapist has you in the guesthouse , okay ?
give it one @-@ two , like , quick . all right , you try .
good . good . good .
have you talked to your father ?
why , when we &apos;re hitting a dummy ,
do we talk about my pop ?
oh , well , you know , we &apos;re just in the middle
of self @-@ defense training , so ...
uh , no .
frankie thinks he has a girlfriend .
he &apos;s still in florida .
does your mother know ?
no .
here she is . why don &apos;t we tell her ?
hey , ma . yeah , no , i &apos;m just hanging out here with maura ,
and she thinks you should know about dad &apos;s new bimbo .
no ! what are you doing ? !
i &apos;m just kidding . it &apos;s operations .
rizzoli . yeah .
all right . we &apos;ll be right there .
harder .
good . self @-@ defense training is over , okay ?
we got a murder .
mother of one of the dancers was stabbed to death .
she made it to the stage , then collapsed .
in front of all these kids ?
nobody saw it happen ?
nope .
have you found the crime scene ?
just following the blood .
i &apos;d like to see the body .
are you gonna get that ?
it &apos;s not important .
i always wanted to be a competitive dancer ,
but my mother was a purist .
she only let me study russian ballet .
it &apos;s like little league with sequins .
ahh . how long you got to work out
to get biceps like that on a 10 @-@ year @-@ old ?
30 to 40 .
hours ? !
and i thought i was doing good job working out two days a week .
that is a very sharp pair of scissors .
penetrating stab wound
between the third and fourth intercostal .
defensive wounds on her hands .
&quot; sapphire dance studio . &quot;
everyone in the studio has touched those scissors .
says &quot; crime of opportunity &quot; to me .
let &apos;s follow this blood trail .
did we have a hurricane this morning ?
you think this is bad ,
try sharing a bathroom with two brothers .
needed a hazmat suit to walk in there .
o @-@ kay . this is embarrassing .
it &apos;s just a bra , korsak .
probably more embarrassing to the 12 @-@ year @-@ old who left it there .
okay , we got a killer
who entered and exited a dance competition .
what i want to know is ,
w @-@ why here , why now ?
12 dancers and their mothers used this room .
i got all the names .
who keeps calling ?
melody .
she wants me to co @-@ sign a lease
to open her dream yoga studio .
what , you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i don &apos;t want to be melody &apos;s bank .
you seen josh yet ?
melody did a number on him .
he thinks i deserted him .
i &apos;m so sorry , bud .
so you weren &apos;t here when your wife was , um ...
i , uh , had a meeting in revere .
i &apos;m a general contractor .
there you go .
denise always texts me
in time to see dakota dance .
but she , uh ...
she didn &apos;t this time .
can i , uh ... can i take my daughter home now ?
yeah . yeah . we &apos;ll need to talk to you again .
all right . come on , hon .
girl &apos;s name is dakota .
she said her mother didn &apos;t say anything before she died .
no one saw the husband before or immediately after the murder .
said he had a meeting in revere .
check it . check the gps on his phone , too .
make sure he &apos;s telling the truth .
this is the head of the sapphire dance studio . coach jj ?
yeah . detective rizzoli ,
sergeant detective korsak .
hey , um , how much longer do you think this is gonna take ?
i &apos;ve got a bunch of really upset moms and kids .
well , how well did you know denise ryan ?
saw her almost every day for three years ,
but actually i felt like i didn &apos;t know her at all .
she was just --
she wasn &apos;t like the other dance moms .
in what way ?
these ladies drive two hours
to get to my studio several times a week ,
&apos;cause they all think that
their kid is good enough to win nationals .
only dakota is good enough to win .
she could win it all .
but denise would only let her compete locally .
she give you a reason ?
yeah , she said they had money problems .
maybe the dad didn &apos;t want her competing ?
no , skip was great .
he &apos;d haul our props around in his truck .
he was real friendly .
she was the one who didn &apos;t talk to anybody .
is there a video of the dance competition ?
yeah . yeah . yeah . um , &quot; rise to the rhythm &quot;
will be happy to sell you one in the lobby .
rizzoli .
yes , sir .
it &apos;s commander cavanaugh . he wants to talk to you .
sean ?
you don &apos;t answer your damn phone , vince ?
i &apos;m sorry . i thought it was melody .
it was .
she was calling to tell you
what we just picked up your stepson , josh .
what ?
oh , my god .
what ?
they just arrested josh for shooting gerry kincaid .
he shot a cop ?
korsak raised josh from the time he was 2
until melody took him away when he was 11 .
damn . why didn &apos;t he fight for him ?
he did , but he didn &apos;t have any legal rights .
and , then , josh &apos;s deadbeat dad
wouldn &apos;t give up his parental rights .
he never mentions him .
yeah , well , there &apos;s a reason for that .
you want to see a grown man cry ?
the kid shot gerry kincaid , jane .
that guy &apos;s like santa claus .
i know . i know .
kincaid &apos;s in surgery .
how &apos;s it looking ?
not good .
josh was caught coming out of a sporting @-@ goods store .
kincaid was walking a foot beat , came up on him ,
and josh shot him with his own gun .
oh , my god .
well , can i -- can i see him ? can i see josh ?
he says he doesn &apos;t want to talk to anybody .
i &apos;m his father !
legally , you &apos;re not , vince .
well , i &apos;m getting him a lawyer .
rizzoli , frost .
sir .
i &apos;m gonna need you two to keep focused
on the dead dance mom . you got that ?
yes , sir .
so , vince , you -- you take care of your business .
vince !
why didn &apos;t you answer the phone ?
because it was me calling ?
i needed you .
you didn &apos;t take my calls for five years .
you take him away from me .
you tell him i don &apos;t care about him .
and now you need me ?
because it &apos;s convenient for you ?
vince , please .
you know , he shot a cop , melody .
no ! it wasn &apos;t josh !
they caught him running from the scene
with blood on his clothes and the gun in his hand .
the officer he shot is fighting for his life .
i know him . he &apos;s a friend .
i need you to go home , please .
will you go see him ? make sure he &apos;s okay ?
i tried .
he won &apos;t talk to me .
well , he &apos;s just scared . h @-@ he &apos;s --
he &apos;s a minor . he &apos;s 16 !
not if kincaid dies he &apos;s not .
they will charge him as an adult with first @-@ degree murder .
there are some stuff in the audience .
but there &apos;s most of the girls dancing .
i found the coach in the audience
at the time of the murder ,
and some of the mothers , but not all of them .
what about the dad -- skip ?
not here .
skip is an odd name for a grown man , you know ?
i got a friend that goes by &quot; swampy . &quot;
worse .
skip and denise owned a general @-@ contracting company .
but business wasn &apos;t too good .
tax liens , subcontractors that haven &apos;t been paid .
what about his phone records ?
nothing out of the ordinary .
hold -- let me check the gps on skip &apos;s phone .
yeah , didn &apos;t he say he was at
a meeting in revere at the time of the murder ?
but that &apos;s not what his phone says .
he was right next to that auditorium
when his wife was killed .
you lied to us , skip .
you were in the area when your wife was being stabbed to death .
don &apos;t make me look at her like that .
why not ?
that &apos;s what she looked like right after you killed her .
i would never hurt her .
she was the best wife ,
the most loving mother .
so , if you didn &apos;t kill her , why did you tell us
you were in revere at a business meeting ?
i was next door at the hotel bar .
drinking . because your business is in the toilet ?
yeah .
right , so , you get lit up ,
you get in a fight with your wife ... - no .
... stabbed her with a pair of scissors .
no , i was at that bar
until coach jj called and told me what happened .
this is too easy to check , skip .
if all you were doing is having a few beers ,
why lie ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m not her real dad .
but she loves me like i am ,
and i @-@ i don &apos;t want her to know i @-@ i messed up .
is her biological father in the picture ?
no , he died when dakota was little .
i @-@ i @-@ i met denise when dakota was 3,
fell in love with them both .
been sober since .
i don &apos;t want her to ever know about the drinking .
well , let &apos;s hope that &apos;s the worst thing there is to know .
how &apos;s sergeant korsak ?
spinning .
72 % of incarcerated
juvenile delinquents grew up in broken homes .
what a fun fact .
you should tell him that next time you see him .
poor guy .
any update on officer kincaid ?
he &apos;s out of surgery , but it doesn &apos;t look good .
he &apos;s a month away from retirement , maura .
the whole department is just so sad
that it happened to an old @-@ timer .
and how is sergeant korsak taking it ?
feels totally responsible .
he shouldn &apos;t .
clinical studies indicate
that good parents can raise bad children .
hmm .
hmm . she was a natural blonde .
not many blondes go brunette .
well , except for keira knightley and drew barrymore .
have we been reading the supermarket tabloids again ?
just s @-@ scanning the headlines .
oh , please don &apos;t repeat that .
uh , no . i &apos;m a vault .
serious foot deformities . look .
oh , man ! those are ugly @-@ ass feet .
what , was she binding them ? !
wh-- it &apos;s from en pointe work , which is a --
&quot; on point . &quot; i know . i know .
four years of forced ballet class ,
thanks to my mother .
you did ? russian ?
well , if the teacher is a mean , old lady
who swats you in the legs with a cane
if they &apos;re not straight enough , yeah .
wait . you studied with svetlana alexandrov ?
pretty sure her name was mrs. peabody .
so , what , she started point early ?
uh , y @-@ yes , before her bones ossified sufficiently .
so the mother was a serious dancer ,
just like her daughter , dakota .
well , russian en pointe is very different than contemporary --
a combination of ballet , jazz , hip @-@ hop .
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
practice with me . &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
yes . serious dancer .
hmm ! well , she &apos;s pretty .
well , in an artificial sort of way .
that &apos;s because she &apos;s had extensive plastic surgery .
breast augmentation , rhinoplasty ...
facial implants -- cheek and chin .
well , come -- that &apos;s just vain .
let &apos;s not judge .
it &apos;s frost . kincaid is back in surgery .
okay . i got to go upstairs .
he says he has something .
yep .
i &apos;ll call you later .
all right .
checked with the bartender .
skip was at the bar the whole time .
that &apos;s too bad .
he was looking really good as a suspect .
yeah . i got us two new suspects .
bpd responded to a disturbance call
two weeks ago at sapphire dance studio .
for what ?
crazy dance moms yvonne and kim .
both of them have daughters who compete against dakota --
summer and mackenzie .
and dakota beats little summer and mackenzie , doesn &apos;t she ?
every time .
here &apos;s the vandalism report .
uniforms broke up a fight between the two mothers
after one of them damaged the other &apos;s car .
yeah . denise &apos;s minivan was keyed .
yeah , all because dakota has a better , uh --
what do you call this one ?
a plie .
yeah .
what ? i @-@ i took dance classes , too .
really ?
yeah .
really .
okay .
i don &apos;t know . i just -- i don &apos;t get this world .
i mean , it &apos;s just a beauty pageant with rhythm .
no . no , it isn &apos;t . come on .
dancers are athletes in costumes ,
you know , like ... like ice skaters .
skaters are not athletes .
really ? and golfers are ?
mm . yeah .
bowlers ?
yeah .
nascar drivers ?
yeah .
and a girl with six @-@ pack abs
who can do a side leap higher than kobe can jump
is not an athlete ?
no .
okay . okay .
oh , man .
pay dirt .
yvonne and kim were the only mothers
from sapphire dance who were not in the audience video .
look what i just found .
it was posted by another dance mom .
that &apos;s our victim , denise ,
with yvonne and kim .
i said i need to talk to you , fucking bitch .
mackenzie and summer could
beat dakota if they cheated like you do .
you &apos;re gonna make my daughter cry . please stop .
you know how many times dakota has made summer cry ?
yeah , because dakota beats her ? !
maybe you should teach her how to lose !
you bitch !
you know what , you bitch ? !
my daughter is gonna beat your daughter in nationals !
ouch ! god ! let &apos;s go get these two
before they kill somebody else .
nice . pull up . pull up .
what &apos;s with the arm ? come on .
let &apos;s see some arms .
mackenzie , what &apos;s with this leg ? pull up .
pull up !
this is not summer camp .
hey ! you &apos;re late !
and how many times have i said , &quot; no booty shorts &quot; ? !
get out of my studio until you &apos;ve changed . go .
i am so sorry ,
coach . it won &apos;t happen again . i promise .
booty shorts are the gateway outfit .
you got to be firm with them ,
or they go all britney spears on you .
uh , what about the security guard ?
got to be firm with the mothers , too .
any word on denise ?
we have a few more questions for you .
oh . okay .
just let me get my dancers warmed up .
start stretching the legs ,
or i &apos;ll break them !
okay . shoot .
uh , y @-@ you didn &apos;t mention
that some of the dance moms hated denise ryan .
if you were gonna investigate every dance mom at my studio
that got into a screaming match , you &apos;d be here 24 / 7 .
you &apos;re open 24 hours ?
almost . we go seven days a week .
if you want to be a champion ,
you put in the time .
tell us about yvonne and kim .
you said it . they hated denise .
why ? because they were jealous of dakota winning everything ?
sure . but i tell you what .
if they were gonna kill anybody to stop dakota ,
they &apos;d have to kill me .
that girl &apos;s a hard worker ,
and she doesn &apos;t give me any trouble ,
not like some of these other ones . hey !
excuse me .
you two just lost your duet high @-@ golds .
i want those trophies tomorrow . now , warm up !
move !
oh , dakota &apos;s here .
how &apos;s she holding up ?
she wanted to dance .
well , that &apos;s good . you know , keep her in her routine .
i &apos;m putting work on hold .
i &apos;m not letting her out of my sight .
you don &apos;t think someone here did it , do you ?
we &apos;re looking at everybody .
i think we should bring those two in for a little chat .
i &apos;m not gonna lie . denise was poison .
and her kid was mean , too .
you know , dakota dropped summer
in a lift at the sparkles competition .
and you think it was deliberate ?
hell , yes .
was it deliberate when tonya harding tried
to take out nancy kerrigan ?
i think so . that cost summer an elite spot .
where were you yesterday at 3 : 00 p.m. ?
uh , well , i wasn &apos;t in the dressing room ,
stabbing denise ,
if that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking .
i was in the audience .
we checked the video . didn &apos;t see you .
i bought a pass to tape summer from the video platform .
i get sick of seeing the other kids
in the group &apos;s numbers , so ...
the competition runs a recording from the platform .
parents pay the 30 bucks .
that &apos;s yvonne . right there .
so she was telling the truth .
oh , come on , man .
damn , that &apos;s cold .
korsak , don &apos;t worry about it .
i haven &apos;t even seen josh in five years .
but i don &apos;t blame them for looking at me
like it &apos;s my fault .
i wish there was something we could do for korsak .
yeah , me too .
there was a time when
i could have gone either way ,
when my dad wasn &apos;t around .
i just think that josh should know that korsak wanted him .
i know .
come on .
let &apos;s go shake up dance mom kim .
where was she when denise was bleeding out ?
yeah . i keyed denise &apos;s car .
only on the passenger door .
look , i &apos;m pretty sure
that dakota took one of mackenzie &apos;s jazz shoes .
i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t go after the driver &apos;s door , too .
that &apos;s not why i lost my temper .
we &apos;re listening .
denise lied about dakota &apos;s age . i &apos;m sure of it .
i &apos;m the team mom ,
so i &apos;m in charge of the girls &apos; registration materials .
denise never gave me
the original birth certificate for dakota .
so , you think denise doctored this
so dakota could compete against younger girls ?
yeah . i sure do .
look , if you want to win at all costs ,
you &apos;ll do anything .
keep that . that &apos;s what you should be investigating .
we have video footage of the audience .
you &apos;re not in it .
oh , i was buying dance videos for the team .
it &apos;s time @-@ stamped .
wow.you -- you came with your own case file .
well , i didn &apos;t think you asked me to come here for coffee .
did you kill denise ryan ?
no . i didn &apos;t like her .
but i didn &apos;t kill her .
you okay ?
do i look okay ?
what , you come in here to get your licks in , too ?
josh .
why are you here ?
i told my mom i didn &apos;t want to talk to you .
your mother and i divorced ,
but i never stopped being your father .
oh , yeah . &quot; dad . &quot;
it was -- it was a blast
hanging out with you the last couple years --
on the weekends , the summer vacations ...
field trips , ballgames .
h @-@ how did you find all that time ?
i called . i wrote . i sent birthday presents .
you &apos;re a liar , vince .
cut the tough @-@ guy bullshit .
i know you &apos;re hurt .
and i know you &apos;re angry .
i wasn &apos;t there for you .
not because i didn &apos;t want to be .
but i &apos;m here now .
i don &apos;t need you now .
i &apos;m fine .
the hell you are .
you &apos;re accused of shooting a cop .
i want to know , did you ?
did you do that , josh ?
because the boy i knew and loved couldn &apos;t .
i want this guy out of here ,
and i want a lawyer .
i got a great lawyer ,
someone who can help you .
no , i want a public defender .
you don &apos;t owe me anything , vince .
bye @-@ bye .
so , who wanted denise ryan dead ?
i &apos;m coming up empty .
i mean , she had no friends , no job .
all she did was take dakota to school and to dance .
and home with skippy , who has an alibi .
i dug around in denise &apos;s life to see if we missed somebody .
guess what . denise ryan didn &apos;t have a single credit card .
well , they were having money problems .
no , i mean , like , no credit history ...
at all .
that is weird .
who makes it to age 35 with no credit ?
did you run her social ?
yeah . it &apos;s good . found a passport , driver &apos;s license .
what &apos;s korsak doing in bric ?
cavanaugh said he talked to josh .
how &apos;d it go ?
afraid to ask .
nobody blames you .
josh does .
oh , that was on castle island .
the blues were running .
oh . he loved the boat .
why did she take him away , korsak ?
i was working a lot .
i didn &apos;t realize how needy she was until it was over .
i think she was drinking . she was lonely .
she reached out to josh &apos;s bio dad .
he led her on , encouraged her to move to florida .
that &apos;s crap .
she thought it would be
good for josh to get to know his real father .
what ? you were his real father .
cavanaugh slip you this ?
josh &apos;s prints are all over the gun .
crime lab matched the blood on his clothes
to gerry kincaid .
between the prints and the blood ,
it &apos;s open @-@ and @-@ shut .
no , vince , it &apos;s not .
there &apos;s a second set of prints on the gun .
what ?
yeah .
gavin thompson , 17 .
josh had a friend with that name .
i never liked that kid .
well , yeah , look at his record --
b &amp; e , robbery , assault .
i want to bring this gavin thompson in .
i already assigned a team to pick him up ,
but i &apos;ll keep you in the loop .
okay , look , if you need me ,
i &apos;ll be in the building , all right ?
maura &apos;s found something new on our dance mom .
sir .
okay .
what do you got ?
her plastic surgery is much more extensive
than i initially realized .
she get a boob job on her wrist ?
i mean , i don &apos;t have an m.d. or anything ,
but i &apos;m fairly confident those are fingers .
i x @-@ rayed her skeleton to make sure
i hadn &apos;t missed any surgeries .
and i found evidence of repetitive spiral fractures
to both of her wrists -- at least three .
so she &apos;s a battered spouse .
perhaps .
but spiral fractures
are also a common skiing injury in the lower leg
due to the inflexibility of a boot in a fall .
maura ,
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s doing handstands in her ski boots .
probably not .
so , how old are these fractures ?
well , uh , they are at least a decade old .
well , so that means it wasn &apos;t skip .
maybe it was dakota &apos;s biological father .
i &apos;m starting to think that denise ryan
wasn &apos;t just a suburban dance mom .
nothing .
did a nationwide search , all 50 states .
well , denise fractured both her wrists three times .
and maura &apos;s certain that
the bones were set each time by a doctor .
w-- there has to be medical records .
i checked her full name -- denise burke ryan .
didn &apos;t come up on any hospital records .
what about when dakota was born ?
birth certificate lists florida general .
this is weird .
there &apos;s no record of a dakota ryan &apos;s birth .
okay . the father &apos;s deceased .
there &apos;s a name here . xavier r. white .
check ncic ,
also look for domestic @-@ abuse reports
or restraining orders against him .
no hits .
nothing ?
there &apos;s no death certificate .
well , the lack of information is telling me something .
like what ?
well , think about it .
denise had extensive plastic surgery .
this is way beyond vain .
she didn &apos;t want anyone to recognize her .
and we can &apos;t find anything that says
she existed before 10 years ago .
yeah .
that says she might be in witsec , right ?
witness protection program . yeah .
yeah . pieces all fit .
i &apos;ll call the u.s. marshals office .
they &apos;re not gonna tell you anything .
i &apos;ve been through this before .
so , what do we do ?
come on .
perfect baseball stitch .
uniform length .
knots on the inside .
sorry to interrupt your little crafts project ,
but we need your help with something .
you think you can help us re @-@ create
what she looked like before surgery ?
sure . sure . can you hand me that scalpel ?
thanks .
uh , what are you doing ?
peeling off her face .
she -- she did not just say that .
we were hoping that you could do it on the computer .
well , i suppose we could do that ,
but it &apos;s certainly not as hands @-@ on .
they picked up gavin thompson .
punk was riding a skateboard
stolen from the sporting @-@ goods store .
cavanaugh &apos;s getting ready
to interrogate him . i &apos;m gonna watch it .
i &apos;m gonna go with you .
why ?
to keep you out of handcuffs .
i &apos;m not going away for killing a cop .
i had nothing to do with it .
bullshit , kid .
we got your prints on the gun ,
and we got your buddy josh in there
telling us the whole story .
what did josh say ?
nothing .
cavanaugh &apos;s got to try to
play them one off against the other .
how do you explain having your prints on a cop &apos;s gun ?
i did the break @-@ in .
as for all that other mess that went down ...
what did josh say ?
look ...
you know how this works . first up , best dressed .
you talk ...
and i might be able to help you out .
god , don &apos;t .
josh got the same chance as this kid .
he didn &apos;t take it .
i was behind josh when we came out of
the back of the store .
that cop came from out of nowhere .
he was an old guy , so josh got the gun away from him .
then how &apos;d your prints get on it ?
the cop was on the ground .
josh pointed the gun at him .
i grabbed the gun , tried to stop him .
but he just pulled the trigger .
shot him .
he hates cops .
this guy who married his mom was a cop .
damn it .
josh is gonna tell me what the hell happened !
not now , all right ?
not while you &apos;re this angry .
anger &apos;s the only thing i got anymore .
i can do this alone .
i know you can . i just don &apos;t want you to .
leave him cuffed .
what ?
you see this man ?
he &apos;s fighting for his life right now .
and his four kids and his wife are crying their eyes out .
don &apos;t look away from me .
your buddy gavin just gave you up .
nice try , vince .
gavin &apos;s been my friend
longer than you pretended to be my dad .
you might want to see this .
the cop was on the ground .
josh pointed the gun at him .
i grabbed the gun , tried to stop him .
but he just pulled the trigger . shot him .
what do you have to say about that , josh ?
go to hell .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
do you understand that if this officer dies ,
you &apos;re going to prison for the rest of your life ?
say something .
damn it . say something .
vince ! vince ! no ! vince !
stop it ! stop it .
i found this stevia in the health @-@ food store .
thank you .
just how you like it .
i have a son who &apos;s , uh ...
been in some trouble .
you do ?
i mean , he didn &apos;t shoot anybody or anything .
but he ran over a priest .
oh , my god .
father crowley &apos;s been really good about it ,
and tommy feels terrible .
he did time . it was three years .
so i know exactly what you &apos;re feeling .
i feel like living the last five years of my life over again .
i took josh away from the only man
who ever gave a damn about him .
i better go . i &apos;m gonna soak some pots .
i could say &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; every day for the rest of my life .
but it still wouldn &apos;t be enough .
i don &apos;t know who that kid is .
when we left you , he --
when i left you ...
josh asked about you every day .
&quot; where &apos;s dad ? &quot;
&quot; why didn &apos;t dad come with us ? &quot;
what &apos;d you say ?
that you were in love with your job , not us .
that you weren &apos;t ever coming for us .
he loves you , vince .
no matter what he tells you , he loves you .
is that what denise would have looked like
without all that plastic surgery ?
yes . i &apos;m focusing on federal criminal trials in 2000 .
detective frost is looking at 2001 .
it &apos;s a big search . she wanted to help .
we &apos;re hoping to get a hit on facial recognition .
on any database we might be able to find a photograph
of a woman who testified in a high @-@ profile trial .
listen to you , columbo .
oh , my goodness !
detective frost , did i do it ?
i think you did .
denise &apos;s real name was debbie brown .
her husband was a miami drug trafficker .
roberto gusano . mexican national .
typical fed tactic --
they charged denise with conspiracy to violate drug laws
to get her to testify against her husband .
gusano got a 10 @-@ year sentence ,
and he still fought for custody .
that &apos;s why denise wouldn &apos;t give up
dakota &apos;s real birth certificate to dance mom kim .
yeah , i bet she doctored it
birth date and father &apos;s name --
so dakota would be harder to find .
witsec won &apos;t forge documents , right ?
that &apos;s right . you can change your name ,
but not your birth date .
ah . poor denise .
she had to leave everything behind , her friends , her family .
hide from gusano for the rest of her life .
where &apos;s gusano being held ?
super @-@ max penitentiary in colorado .
he looks very mean .
i &apos;m calling the u.s. marshals .
i thought you said they wouldn &apos;t help .
they don &apos;t have a choice now that we have a name .
i was assigned to oversee denise ryan &apos;s relocation
from florida to boston .
i check in with her once a month .
well , how come we didn &apos;t hear from you when she was murdered ?
there was nothing we could do .
your agency was already investigating .
we think roberto gusano
may have called a hit on denise from prison .
i am not at liberty to tell you how i know ,
but i know that didn &apos;t happen .
that &apos;s gusano &apos;s daughter , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m sorry . there really isn &apos;t much i can tell you .
why are you protecting gusano ?
again , i am not at liberty to say .
prison records say gusano &apos;s in super @-@ max in colorado .
but you guys at the justice department
control federal prison records .
gusano &apos;s a government witness , isn &apos;t he ?
damn . you think he &apos;s in witsec ?
yeah , i do .
that &apos;s right , isn &apos;t it ?
where &apos;s gusano now ?
i honestly don &apos;t know , detective .
are those photos of denise ?
yes . denise grew up in florida .
danced with several professional companies .
she met gusano when she was visiting her sister .
they look close .
inseparable , according to denise .
what &apos;s her sister &apos;s name ?
her name was gabrielle radford .
&quot; was &quot; ? i &apos;m assuming she &apos;s not dead , so , wh--
she &apos;s in witsec , too ?
you wouldn &apos;t tell me where gabrielle was even if you knew .
well , the rules of witsec are hard ,
but it &apos;s the only way we know how to keep people safe .
please let me know when you find her killer .
whitmore .
the rules of witsec --
never speak to friends or family from the past ever .
what are you thinking ?
well , no one can do that .
i &apos;m gonna say something ,
even if you don &apos;t want to hear it .
you &apos;re my son , and i love you .
and even if you did this ,
i won &apos;t abandon you .
do you hear me ?
yeah .
you really tried to call ?
yes .
you sent letters ?
almost every day , for a long time , josh .
dad ... i didn &apos;t do it .
what ? talk to me , josh . tell me everything .
gavin &apos;s lying .
h @-@ he &apos;s the one who shot the cop .
i tried to wrestle the gun away from him .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
i thought he was my friend .
i @-@ i c @-@ couldn &apos;t believe
that you thought that i would do that .
lawyer told me not to talk to anyone .
how did you get officer kincaid &apos;s blood all over you ?
i tried to help him .
i tried to give him cpr ,
just like you taught me when i was a kid .
when i heard the sirens ...
i knew i was in big trouble ...
so i took off .
i &apos;m gonna get you out of here , josh .
it &apos;s gavin &apos;s word against josh ,
and gavin talked first .
e.m.s. report says kincaid
was breathing on his own when they arrived .
well , they have to note it if cpr was administered .
you see that box ? the paramedic checked &quot; no . &quot;
that should be officer kincaid &apos;s chest x @-@ rays from the e.r.
you see these lines ,
where the rib 1 and 2 connect to the sternum ?
yes .
they &apos;re fractures .
the force exerted to the chest during cpr
sometimes can result in broken ribs .
it &apos;s the only explanation
for gerry kincaid &apos;s injured ribs .
it &apos;s not enough .
the only one who can confirm
that josh tried to help is kincaid ,
and he &apos;s still not conscious .
well , i think you need to be prepared .
he may never regain consciousness .
but the forensic proof may be right here .
on josh &apos;s clothes ?
there &apos;s a higher concentration of blood at the knee ...
and here on the toes of josh &apos;s sneakers .
so you &apos;re saying the clothes
prove that josh was kneeling over kincaid &apos;s body .
giving him cpr .
but i &apos;m not saying anything .
the clothes are . the evidence is .
my son is telling the truth .
denise and gabrielle are both dancers .
m @-@ maybe they tried to talk to each other in chat rooms .
how many dance websites are there ?
here &apos;s denise &apos;s e @-@ mail address .
what &apos;s &quot; a bunhead &quot; ?
a ballerina .
well denise wouldn &apos;t want
to get kicked out of witsec , you know ?
i mean , she &apos;d be almost as afraid
of the government as she &apos;d be of gusano .
terrorists figured out a pretty smart way
to get around government monitoring .
they write the e @-@ mail but don &apos;t send it .
i &apos;m not following you .
yep . here it is .
denise has a bunch of unsent mail .
basically , you give your password to someone .
they access the account remotely
and read the unsent mail .
gabrielle and denise were in touch .
&quot; gabs , dakota is on fire .
you have to see my baby dance .
&quot; saturday at the tourraine hotel and convention center .
please ? it has to be safe now . &quot;
here &apos;s the i.p. address that accessed the account remotely .
belongs to gabrielle bronson .
westboro , mass .
sisters lived 30 minutes from each other .
come on . let &apos;s go talk to gabrielle .
she &apos;s been tortured .
well , i think we know how gusano found denise .
u.s. marshals ! freeze !
oh ! boston police !
stand down .
maybe you want to tell me again
how you think gusano had nothing to do with this ?
honest to god , i didn &apos;t think he did .
wait a minute . i @-@ i &apos;m curious .
what are you doing here if you didn &apos;t know where she was ?
i didn &apos;t know she left witsec .
after talking to you , i talked to my superior .
i thought we should look in on her .
and you still think gusano had nothing to do with this ?
i want to know where he is .
we put him in rapid city .
his case officer thought he was there ,
but he slipped away somehow .
they gave him early release after he agreed
to testify against the diaz cartel .
he &apos;s not gonna testify .
he &apos;s going back to mexico ,
and he &apos;s taking dakota with him .
where &apos;s dakota ?
she &apos;s about to perform . why ? what &apos;s wrong ?
okay , where &apos;s dakota ? she &apos;s supposed to be in this .
you take stage right , i got stage left .
where &apos;s dakota ?
where &apos;s dakota ? have you seen her ?
i don &apos;t know . i haven &apos;t seen her .
please ! let me go !
what &apos;s going on ?
gusano , let her go !
please !
it &apos;s okay , honey . come on .
everything &apos;s gonna be fine .
it &apos;s over , gusano . let dakota go .
she &apos;s my daughter !
back off , all of you ...
and she won &apos;t get hurt .
i just want what &apos;s mine !
skip , stay back !
no , skip !
let go of her !
we need an ambulance .
we &apos;re at the tourraine , sir . push it !
oh , please don &apos;t let him die , too !
okay , baby , let me help him , okay ?
just let me help him . put your hand there .
it &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s okay , sweetheart .
just put your hand there .
it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re gonna be all right .
just hang on , okay ? it &apos;s okay .
you really should limit your red @-@ meat consumption .
i &apos;m gonna eat whatever i want ,
whenever i want from now on .
life is too short .
i thought the girl &apos;s father was okay .
mm . he is . he got lucky .
he &apos;ll be out of the hospital in a few days .
i , however , am still recovering .
it looks delicious . maybe just a bite .
no , maura , come on !
that &apos;s not a bite . that &apos;s half my burger !
good news . i &apos;ve just come from the hospital .
gerry kincaid regained consciousness .
he &apos;s gonna make it .
that &apos;s not good news . that &apos;s excellent news .
and how &apos;s josh ?
cavanaugh &apos;s charging him with b &amp; e , like he should .
oh , i believe the parenting books
call that &quot; tough love , &quot; dad .
yeah , i didn &apos;t tell him the d.a.
is not gonna prosecute
because he &apos;s testifying against his scumbag friend gavin .
well , i hope a former friend .
maura &apos;s eating all of my burger .
i &apos;m gonna order another one . you want one ?
no , thanks . i &apos;m , uh ...
meeting melody .
oh , uh , do you think that maybe later
you can help me work on my jab ?
yeah , i promise to teach you self @-@ defense
if you promise not to punch like a girl .
wh -- i don &apos;t punch like a girl .
yeah , you do . mmm !
i &apos;m gonna get some fries . you want an order ?
no .
yes , i -- i &apos;ll just have one or two .
you &apos;re getting your own order .
are you gonna order some dessert , too ?
you eat like a bottomless pit .
