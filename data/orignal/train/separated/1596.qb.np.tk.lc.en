what &apos;s your name ?
a.j.
this is a guy that me and my brother made up .
we put the symbol in the windows of our bedrooms .
like a bat signal ?
brandon foster , piano .
you &apos;re here as a composer .
you &apos;re a composer too , huh ? i &apos;m tony .
brandon , you &apos;ll be working with kat .
there &apos;s no way you &apos;re pairing me with him .
sometimes i just want to die .
maybe we could do some other stuff tonight .
i don &apos;t want to do it . i mean , i want to do it ,
but not like this . it &apos;s our first time , and ...
we gotta get on the road .
want a beer ?
a.j. ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
i let someone sleep here .
damn it , callie . why ?
you &apos;re fired .
are you almost done in there ?
you do know that we &apos;re in the worst drought
since 800 a.d. , right ?
oh my gosh , i forgot my conditioner .
can you go get it from our bathroom , honey ?
okay , well , can you not waste water while you wait ?
hey , i &apos;m late , and i need to shower too .
hello ?
why don &apos;t you take a spit bath in the kitchen sink ?
wait , what &apos;s a spit bath ?
i don &apos;t know . sounds disgusting ,
but i &apos;m next .
excuse me .
you got wood rot .
wood rot ? that doesn &apos;t sound good .
it isn &apos;t .
you &apos;ll have to open up the wall . and while you &apos;re at it ,
i recommend you upgrade to copper plumbing .
okay , honey , i need ...
honey .
what ?
the guy is here .
yeah . hey , how is it going ? i need my conditioner .
okay , i will bring it to you .
i &apos;ll get it .
thank you . it &apos;s the blue one in the ...
okay , i will bring it to you .
would you quit pushing me ?
dear , honey , please .
so that &apos;s your ... ?
yes .
so , sophia &apos;s coming over today .
how &apos;s she doing ?
good , i think .
we &apos;re just gonna hang out .
but robert invited us
to spend father &apos;s day on his boat .
no , thanks .
you &apos;re totally welcome .
welcome to what ?
if you &apos;re gonna spend father &apos;s day with him , don &apos;t you think
it &apos;s weird to keep calling him robert ?
&apos;morning .
&apos;morning , love .
i don &apos;t have to go .
i don &apos;t care if you go ,
but he &apos;s not my dad .
you don &apos;t have to always invite me . it &apos;s okay .
well , listen , jude , we &apos;re having mike over on sunday ...
kind of a family tradition for father &apos;s day ,
you know , to celebrate
the important men in our lives .
i guess we won &apos;t have to make cheese blintzes this year , will we ?
cheese blintzes ?
yeah , they were my father &apos;s favorites .
my first father &apos;s day without a father .
it &apos;s certainly not gonna be a party
without frank around to offend somebody .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll manage that .
that &apos;s funny .
can i invite my dad ?
donald ?
yeah .
why ?
you &apos;re spending the day with your dad .
it &apos;s a little different .
how is it different ?
well , for starters , robert actually wants to be in my life .
donald just signed the papers and walked away .
robert signed the papers , too .
is he better because he &apos;s rich ?
donald doesn &apos;t want anything to do with you .
you don &apos;t know what he wants .
it &apos;s pretty obvious .
why do you hate him so much ?
&apos;cause he killed our mother .
callie .
it was an accident .
drunk driving is not an accident .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
if jude wants to invite donald ...
then he &apos;s welcome to .
fine .
but don &apos;t be surprised when he doesn &apos;t show up .
it &apos;s perfect .
thank you .
... technically ,
but your melody &apos;s anemic ,
your rhythmic statements are mundane ,
and your intervals are reductive .
the whole piece is utterly jejune .
considering the amount of time that i had ,
i did the best i could .
those are the five most pathetic words in the english language .
people who are satisfied
with the best they can do will never be great .
six , actually .
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
six words .
i never said i was satisfied .
i just ...
then start over .
fine .
okay , i &apos;ll meet you here at 8 : 00 tomorrow morning .
wait , tomorrow ?
i gotta sleep at some point .
you have your whole life to sleep .
we have one shot at disney hall .
get inspired .
and take a shower .
we got one working bathroom at home ,
six people .
i &apos;m just saying .
how is it going with kat ?
oh , you know , she &apos;s ...
a bitch ?
hey , man , we &apos;re all bitches .
and this bitch would give his left nut
to compose for kat .
well , if it was up to me , you could have her .
&apos;cause i &apos;m pretty sure nothing i do
is gonna be good enough for her .
it won &apos;t be .
but if you can take the heat ,
she &apos;s your golden ticket , man .
how do you stay so calm and cool ?
i &apos;m a cool dude .
how &apos;s your fugue ?
it &apos;s pretty tight .
can i hear it ?
yeah , sure .
it &apos;s so cute .
i ordered it online last week .
why don &apos;t you give it to isabella yourself ?
um , i think ana needs some space .
well , i &apos;ll see that she gets it .
but ...
i hope you &apos;re still coming for father &apos;s day .
it would mean the world to victor .
and your uncles and cousins will be here ,
and everybody is so excited to meet you .
look .
is ana coming ?
of course .
she says her brothers are upset that she &apos;s back
and living with you .
they &apos;re wary about their sister .
she put us all through a lot .
it &apos;s gonna take time to trust her .
but we &apos;re family .
and don &apos;t worry ,
we &apos;re gonna keep the party small and intimate .
please say you &apos;ll come .
do your moms know you got fired ?
i haven &apos;t told them yet .
i want to try to find
some other independent study first , you know ,
so they don &apos;t totally freak out .
so where &apos;s this a.j. guy now ?
i don &apos;t know .
living on the streets probably .
was he cute ?
that &apos;s not why i tried to help him .
okay , but he was hot , right ?
stop it .
i &apos;m just saying .
how &apos;s everything with you ?
fine .
you sure ?
yes .
and i wish that everyone would stop asking me that question
every five seconds .
sorry .
hello .
hey , it &apos;s me ... aj .
i &apos;ll just be right back .
okay .
are you in juvie ?
i got arrested .
for huffing .
tagging .
gang signs . but i didn &apos;t ...
i really don &apos;t care .
callie , please , i need your help .
i tried to help you and you screwed me over .
i &apos;m not in a gang .
good for you . i gotta go .
wait .
there &apos;s a skate park on oceanside .
go check it out . you &apos;ll see .
please .
callie . please ?
do me a favor , lose my number .
callie .
i spoke with donald ,
and he would like to come tomorrow .
okay .
is it ?
oh , i won &apos;t be here , so i won &apos;t have to see him .
you want to talk about it ?
no , thank you .
sophia &apos;s outside .
look , i &apos;m really sorry about before .
i ... i &apos;m on these new meds ,
and they make me sort of irritable ,
as my mother would say .
it &apos;s fine .
you want to get out of here ?
yeah .
where do you want to go ?
nice one .
what are we looking for ?
i &apos;m not exactly sure .
there .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a bat signal .
we &apos;re having a party .
no kidding .
come on , take a break .
come have a beer .
no , i ... i can &apos;t .
just one beer .
no , i ... i ... i really can &apos;t .
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s not .
yeah , that &apos;s right . you know why ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re all in your head .
come on , man , you gotta chillax .
look , even if i wanted to chillax ,
i would still have to drive home and then get up
at the crack of ass to get back here by 8 : 00 .
you don &apos;t have to get up at the crack of ass ,
&apos;cause your ass can crash in my crib ...
on one condition .
one beer , and then i gotta get back to work .
cheers .
cheers .
what ?
kat .
brandon .
get over here .
go .
hey . i was just having one beer .
well , that &apos;s no fun .
come on , let &apos;s do tequila shots .
hey , a.j. i &apos;m stef .
what &apos;s this ?
this is my foster mom .
you asked me for help .
go ahead , have a seat .
i won &apos;t bite .
callie tells me that you &apos;re looking for your brother ,
you think he might be missing . does he have a name ?
is he in trouble ?
well , you tell me .
i mean , because i ran away to meet up with him ?
yeah , but you didn &apos;t meet up with him ,
did you ?
no , he never showed .
okay , what was the plan if he had showed ?
we were gonna go to arizona .
he said knew some guy that could get him a job there
in construction .
we just wanted to be together .
you were arrested for tagging , yes ?
yeah , but cops just assume that &apos; cause i &apos;m black i &apos;m in a gang .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t assume that .
but , you know , it is illegal to deface property ,
even if you are just leaving a message for someone .
look , i was gonna turn myself in .
but i knew that once i got back in the system ,
i &apos;d be harder to find .
i just wanted ty to know where i was .
ty ?
tyrone hensdale .
that &apos;s my brother .
is there any chance that
he might have gone to arizona by himself ?
no , there &apos;s no chance .
if he didn &apos;t show , it &apos;s &apos; cause something happened to him .
okay , fair enough .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
are you gonna be okay in here ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
thank you .
that was fun .
you are fun .
well , you are fun .
what , does that surprise you ?
a little , yeah .
listen , we got off on the wrong foot .
do you know what the soul of genius is ?
love . that &apos;s what mozart said .
love .
right .
i need to love you .
okay .
i also need to pee .
go for it .
hey , you .
we are going to disney hall .
all right .
and i &apos;m sleeping in tomorrow .
great .
you &apos;re fun .
you &apos;re really fun .
these kids are so luck .
i even hear a single few
that &apos;s worthy of being played at disney hall .
okay , see ? this is exactly what i &apos;m talking about .
i &apos;m willing to get up on a sunday morning to work with him ,
and he &apos;s 30 minutes late .
what happened , brandon ?
i overslept . i &apos;m sorry .
did you rewrite your fugue ?
no , i didn &apos;t get a chance to finish it .
why ? what were you doing all night ?
he &apos;s obviously not taking the program seriously .
tony said he &apos;s willing to compose for two pianists .
okay , you know what ? i did write a fugue .
she didn &apos;t like it .
it was so ...
jejune .
yeah , i know . whatever the hell that means .
and now he &apos;s defensive .
i deserve a partner as talented and dedicated as i am .
okay , kat . i hear you .
let me think about it .
in the meantime , brandon , let &apos;s hear what you &apos;ve got .
&quot; good for a
batch of fresh cookies . &quot;
yeah .
sounds delicious .
&quot; good for a day at the movies . &quot;
always .
&quot; good for one car wash . &quot; i like that . i like that .
yeah .
oh , i like this one .
&quot; good for one 20 minute foot rub . &quot;
can i redeem this right now ?
oh , yeah .
i &apos;m sure callie wants to watch me rub your feet .
i love all these . these are great ,
except for this one .
i get to teach you to drive ?
well , yeah . callie &apos;s getting her license .
i haven &apos;t done the test yet , so fingers crossed .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll pass with flying colors .
and you have a birthday coming up too .
yes , we &apos;re gonna have a party at the house ,
so i &apos;d love for you all to come .
of course . we &apos;d love to . we &apos;ll be there .
sophia , you need to eat something .
and i will .
so , dad ,
i have something for you .
it &apos;s no big deal .
uh , yes , it is .
yeah , it &apos;s a huge deal .
you took this ?
you don &apos;t have to hang it up or anything .
are you kidding me ? of course i &apos;m gonna hang it up .
it &apos;s beautiful . look .
oh my gosh , callie , it &apos;s amazing .
wow , you &apos;re very talented .
okay , put it away now , please .
mom .
sophia .
i can &apos;t take my meds on an empty stomach .
and god forbid i don &apos;t
take them every day at exactly the same time .
i &apos;m just following your doctor &apos;s orders , sophia .
well , you &apos;ll be happy when
you don &apos;t have me to worry about anymore .
what does that mean ?
when i get better , of course .
he doesn &apos;t have a record , you know .
he &apos;s never been in trouble before .
i spoke to his foster parents ,
and they said that he &apos;s a good student ,
always followed the rules until he ran away .
and they won &apos;t take him back ?
not everybody gives second chances .
or thirds , or fourths .
ha @-@ ha . i don &apos;t know ,
there &apos;s just something about him . he &apos;s a good kid .
and i think the longer he stays in detention ,
the more at risk he is of getting into some real trouble .
you &apos;re thinking about fostering him ?
no , no , no , no , no . we can &apos;t .
but i was thinking about you fostering him .
me ?
yeah , why not you ?
mariana .
are you leaving already ?
i actually haven &apos;t gone in yet .
where &apos;s isabella ?
she &apos;s with my mother .
have you gone in ?
no .
not yet .
are you going to ?
i don &apos;t think so .
why not ?
because i &apos;m embarrassed .
of what ?
of being your daughter .
how are you ?
good . come in .
thanks .
happy father &apos;s day .
oh , thanks .
these are for your moms .
they love flowers .
that &apos;s good .
you ... you &apos;re , like , a foot taller , huh ?
yeah , my moms say i &apos;m gonna
have to start cutting my pants into shorts .
yeah , i had that problem when i was a kid too .
how tall are you ?
six feet .
you &apos;re gonna be taller . my dad ...
your granddad ... was six @-@ three .
so is callie here ?
no , she &apos;s with her dad ...
i mean , robert .
yeah .
a friend of mine &apos;s coming over , with his dad .
okay .
but don &apos;t worry , they don &apos;t know that you were ,
you know , in prison .
so you don &apos;t have to ...
yeah . no , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s okay , jude .
so jude doesn &apos;t want his dad to know ...
about him and me .
i got no problem with that .
the fewer people that know , the better .
look at all those fake smiles .
they think i don &apos;t know .
know what ?
that they &apos;re sending me back to the hospital
or to one of those
therapy boarding schools where they lock you up .
how do you know ?
it &apos;s my mom .
she is afraid to leave me alone ,
afraid i &apos;ll try to hurt myself .
she just wants to get rid of me .
what have they said to you ?
nothing . they &apos;re probably just afraid
that i &apos;ll run away or ...
i don &apos;t know .
are you sure you &apos;re not just ...
what ? being paranoid ?
because i &apos;m crazy ?
you &apos;re not crazy .
they &apos;re always whispering , okay ?
and when i walk into the room , they shut right up .
there was a girl that i met in the hospital .
her parents sent her to one of those schools in montana ,
and she said it was like a prison .
can you please talk to my mom ?
talk to me about what ?
i didn &apos;t mean to hurt your feelings .
oh , it &apos;s okay . i understand .
i &apos;m embarrassed too .
i caused my family a lot of heartache .
want to know a secret ?
i &apos;ve been walking around the block for an hour ,
trying to get the courage up
to show my face in there .
i &apos;m not even sure my brothers will speak to me .
but , mariana ,
i &apos;m the only one who needs to feel ashamed .
i &apos;m the one who did all the bad things , not you .
you and jesus are pure and innocent ,
and no one in there is judging you .
i &apos;m not innocent .
of course you are . you did nothing wrong .
yes , i did .
mariana .
i had sex for the first time ,
and not with mat .
so , anybody following the playoffs ?
miami &apos;s my team , but since lebron left ,
it &apos;s been a miserable season .
yeah . how about you , donald ? who do you like in the finals ?
truth is , i &apos;m not much of a sports fan .
me neither .
so , donald , what you do for a living ?
i &apos;m a mechanic .
oh , nice . you been doing that a long time ?
no , i was in commercial real estate before that .
so am i. we probably know some of the same people .
i doubt it .
it was a while ago . it was ...
it was up in the bay area .
so why did you get out ?
the grind , you know .
i &apos;m just happier fixing cars .
i hear you . tough business , huh ?
it &apos;s not as tough as being a cop though . right , mike ?
i don &apos;t know any different .
you know , stef &apos;s a cop too .
oh , yeah , yeah . no , of course .
well , i think pretty much any profession
has its challenges , right ?
so where in the bay area , don ?
i know a couple of guys up there .
sorry , i &apos;m really late .
you look like hell .
thanks . happy father &apos;s day .
okay , well , who did you have sex with ?
wyatt .
and wyatt is ?
callie &apos;s ex @-@ boyfriend .
i &apos;m a terrible person , and i feel like a slut .
don &apos;t you ever say that about yourself .
i cheated on my boyfriend ,
and i lost my virginity to a random boy i barely know .
i &apos;m pretty sure that makes me a slut .
what if i get pregnant at 15,
just like you did ?
did you use protection ?
a condom .
but what if it had , like , a hole in it or something ?
i heard that happens .
it &apos;s pretty unlikely .
i just kind of want to forget that it ever happened .
well , why do you think it did happen ?
because mat didn &apos;t want to have sex with me ,
so he could hook up with girls on tour .
or he didn &apos;t want to just have sex with you ,
your first time , and then leave .
what teenage boy turns down sex ?
the good ones . the ones who care about you .
the ones who don &apos;t want you to feel
the way you &apos;re feeling right now .
do you think i should tell callie ?
i don &apos;t know .
but ...
you should probably tell your moms .
i &apos;ll tell you one way i think we &apos;re probably a lot alike .
we probably judge ourselves
way harsher than anyone judges us .
so what do you say ,
we go to this party together .
and trust
that we can be forgiven for making mistakes ?
okay .
when ?
well , as soon as ...
we just wanted to have
a nice father &apos;s day and ...
we were gonna tell you tomorrow .
and where will i live ?
at home , with me .
we have no intention of sending you anywhere .
and i &apos;m so sorry , sweetie ,
you thought that &apos;s what was going on .
and this is ...
it &apos;s just a separation , okay ?
we &apos;re not talking about a divorce here .
your father rented a house at the beach .
you can see him anytime you want .
why can &apos;t i live with him ?
sophia , your mother
is not responsible for this .
we just need some time apart .
why ?
i mean , if you &apos;re not getting divorced ,
then why do you need time apart ?
look , sometimes
when you &apos;re not with someone ,
it helps you remember all the reasons you want to be .
they &apos;re still your mom and dad ,
and they still love you ,
and i love you .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
i baked some cookies , if anyone has room left .
not me . i ate like a horse .
yeah , everything was fantastic .
thank you .
it was really delicious . thank you .
how about a toast ? to our amazing hostesses .
cheers .
a toast to the amazing men in our lives .
salud .
brandon , would you like to be excused ?
you look like you could use a nap .
no , i &apos;m good .
yeah , you look real tired .
come on , i &apos;ll tuck you in .
aww , daddy .
all right .
please , don &apos;t get up . i &apos;m just gonna clear the dishes .
let me help you with that .
thanks , love .
thank you .
thanks , donald .
so , donald , are you still in the same place ?
oh , no , actually i had to move .
i should probably give you my new address .
yeah , that &apos;d be nice . nice to know where you are .
do you think callie is gonna be home soon ?
i &apos;d kind of love to see her .
i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to see you too ,
but she &apos;s probably gonna be late .
thanks , adam .
no problem . you &apos;re welcome .
listen , i &apos;ve been doing some reading
about , you know ,
kids connor &apos;s age coming out .
and , well ,
some l.g.b.t. experts say
that it &apos;s better for kids to wait till they get a little older
to go public , you know ,
so they can better cope with bullying and stuff
in school and sports teams and all that .
well , that ship has sailed , at least at anchor beach .
but i can promise you
we have a very strict no @-@ bullying policy .
what do you mean , that ship has sailed ?
so the whole school knows you &apos;re gay ?
was it you ? you the one who told everybody ?
no .
no , we ... i got outed .
by whom ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sorry . i thought your father knew .
what does that matter , adam ?
&apos;cause i happen to care what people think , okay ?
about you or your son ?
well , it seems like it &apos;s his business who knows .
what , you want your son getting bullied too ?
no .
i want my son to be proud of who he is .
getting bullied at home is worse than anything
he &apos;s gonna face out in the world .
that &apos;s not my intention .
i know , dad .
feeling better ?
yeah , a little .
have a few drinks last night ?
no .
no ?
i think i know a hangover when i see one , brandon .
dad , i ...
look , i get it . there &apos;s peer pressure ,
kids like to have parties .
brandon , there &apos;s a reason
it &apos;s illegal to drink before you &apos;re 21 .
teenagers make bad decisions .
they &apos;re not mature enough to drink responsibly .
i didn &apos;t even want to drink .
i just ...
believe me , i regretted it .
well , at least you made one good decision .
you didn &apos;t try to drive home last night .
look , how is idyllwild otherwise ?
it &apos;s intense .
i don &apos;t know . the people are so competitive .
i thought i made a friend ,
but he ended up stabbing me in the back .
you gotta rise above all that , you know .
do your work , stay focused ,
don &apos;t get involved in the petty stuff .
yeah .
hey , can i ask you something ?
how would you feel about me fostering a kid ?
b ?
hey , dad .
yeah ?
i love you .
love you .
thanks for coming .
thanks for the invitation .
it meant a lot , jude .
you know ,
it &apos;s not good for any of us to keep secrets about who we are .
and you have everything to be proud of ,
except me .
if you don &apos;t want to tell people where i &apos;ve been
and what i &apos;ve done , that &apos;s okay .
you don &apos;t have to .
but you don &apos;t have to protect me either .
you know , my story ... it &apos;s part of your story .
you want to tell it ... you got every right .
i just ...
just want to let you know i &apos;m okay with that .
can we stay in touch ?
yeah , you bet .
hey , there &apos;s callie .
donald , this is robert .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , don .
you too .
i have to get a bus .
don &apos;t want to miss it .
in case you forgot ,
donald was there for you when he wasn &apos;t .
and he &apos;s just as much your dad as he is mine .
thanks for today .
yeah , hold on .
sit down . i want to talk to you .
okay , look , i understand
that you &apos;re angry with donald .
but jude &apos;s right . he was there when i wasn &apos;t .
because he pretended he was my father ,
and he never told you about me .
i &apos;m sure he was just respecting your mother &apos;s wishes ,
and he didn &apos;t just pretend to be your father , he raised you .
he killed my mother . it &apos;s his fault that she &apos;s dead .
he made a mistake .
all right , it was a terrible , horrible mistake .
he never should have gotten behind the wheel ,
but your mother never
should have gotten in that car with him either .
so now it &apos;s her fault ?
no , it &apos;s not .
but we &apos;ve all made mistakes .
the only difference is how much suffering they cause .
donald ... he might be out of prison ,
but he will never be free of that guilt
and that remorse .
can you imagine that ?
he still could have fought for us .
look , i had ...
i was unfaithful to jill .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re separating .
i was selfish ,
i broke my promise , and i hurt her very much .
i think i &apos;ve been telling myself all this time
that it was your mother
that was the love of my life .
and i think sometimes i treated jill
like something i settled for .
but the way she stood by me
when you came into our lives ,
with her love and support ,
it made me realize that she is ...
everything .
she &apos;s the love of my life ,
along with sophia , and now you .
and i was very foolish not to see that .
my point is ,
i am not a better man than donald .
i &apos;m just luckier .
so , you a cop too ?
actually , i am .
callie &apos;s foster mom and i are partners ,
and ... we used to be married .
sounds complicated .
no , it &apos;s good , you know ?
