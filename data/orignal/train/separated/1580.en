Her name's Sophia. That's my half sister.
Can we hang out again?
You told Emma about Hailey?
Yes, why would you tell Hailey you were a couple
and not Emma?
That's none of your business.
This is about you trying to be like all those other girls.
Are you OK?
Not really, no.
I ate a pot brownie and I am freaking out.
It's OK, you made a mistake.
I slept with Dani.
Dani?
I haven't told you. I was raped.
I thought I put it behind me.
but it turns out I still have some stuff
I have to work through.
Take as long as you need.
Is Lena gonna be OK?
Yeah, now, but she lost the baby.
Sometimes I'm afraid
that they're not gonna love me as much as I love them.
Biology or not,
everybody's afraid that our children
won't love us the way we love them.
What's taking so freaking long? Did you fall in?
I'm about to leak.
Go downstairs.
Jude's in the bathroom downstairs.
Are you sure... Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
'Cause I, I don't mind.
No, I know.
I think it's better if it's just me and Jude.
I want him to get to know Sophia,
so he doesn't feel so, you know, threatened.
And I don't think he's gonna do that if you're there.
Ok.
And have you decided about what you're gonna tell Robert
about the college fund?
I'm gonna say thanks
but I don't want anything from you,
and that includes your money.
You do know how to swim, yes?
Yes.
Mom, Mariana's way past her time.
Well, you're old enough to work it out.
I'm not getting involved.
Let's go, your 15 minutes was up like 15 minutes ago.
What the...?
Fine, I'll finish in my bedroom.
Don't say I never did anything for you.
Thank you, you're a real saint.
Quite the fashion statement, Judicorn.
Have you seen my other flip-flop?
Nope, sorry.
Uh, no flip-flops, Jude.
Sneakers?
Sneakers.
All right, everybody, taxi leaves in two minutes.
Let's hop to it.
Jesus, Mariana, Callie, Jude. Let's go!
I just need to get my...
Gym bag?
Took the liberty of washing your wrestling gear.
Lesson learned: You can't just let that stuff rot in there.
Yeah, OK.
Yo! Go! Now! Come on, one, two, three, four!
All right, I'll see you later. Where's, um, Brandon?
What's he up to?
Oh, I think he's still sleeping. I'll check on him.
OK, maybe give him a little incentive
to get out of the house?
You and I could use a quiet afternoon at home,
just the two of us.
OK?
Thank you, I love you.
Love you.
Good morning.
Hey, morning.
How you feeling?
Oh, as good as could be expected, I guess.
You?
So you got any plans for the day?
Um, no, probably just gonna work on some music.
That's about it.
Well, the kids are all out of the house.
So I think it's time.
We need to tell.
Good shove.
Good defense! Wedge her! Wedge her!
Watch it! Watch it!
Break!
Match to Jesus. Hey, great footwork.
And Emma, nice escape,
but you lost focus. It cost you.
Right, got it.
All right, let's clear the mats.
And the ladder, I'll see you all tonight.
All right?
Nice match.
That's it?
What? What do you want, Jesus?
I don't know. I just... I just want us to be cool.
I am such an idiot.
I was stupid enough to think
the first words out of your mouth would be "I'm sorry."
I am sorry.
I should have never let Mariana open her big mouth
about me and Hayley.
But don't forget, you broke up with me.
And you waited like five seconds to replace me.
Makes me feel like a real winner, Foster.
How was I supposed to know you wanted to get back together?
I'm not doing this anymore.
Everything's cool, OK?
We never should've dated in the first place.
I mean, if Hayley's what you want, well,
I think we both know she's everything I'm not,
and nothing that I want to be.
But I think it's time that you find a new tutor.
Hey, you're here early.
What was that all about?
Some team stuff.
You OK?
We are so happy you guys could make it.
Soph's been talking about it for days.
Dad, shut up.
Sophia.
Sorry.
I'm just... so excited to finally meet you, Jude.
And for you to finally meet our dad.
I mean...
Yeah, Jude and I already have a dad.
His name's Donald.
Right. Yeah, I know.
Sophia, why don't you come help me put out lunch?
You guys really do look alike, even more in person.
You think?
I guess, a little.
So which side is port?
Uh... this one.
Why don't you just say "Left?"
Well, you don't want there to be any confusion, you know?
In case somebody's facing the opposite direction,
or if something goes wrong.
Come on.
Lena, I'm home!
I'm in the living room.
Hi.
Hey, honey.
What's going on?
You expecting someone?
Hey.
Hi, what's up?
Lena called, said you wanted to talk?
I do?
What's going on, love?
Is this about the surgery? You changed your mind?
No, this isn't about his hand.
Uh, Brandon has something to tell you both,
something important,
and I'd like everyone to promise that no one leaves this house
until we all agree how to handle this together,
as a family.
Ok.
OK, so... what's with the buildup?
What are we talking about?
It's about Dani.
I knew it.
I knew you had a problem with her, Brandon.
No, no, it's...
B?
This is hard for him to say, just give him a minute.
Brandon, please, tell me that this isn't what I'm thinking.
What are you thinking?
Brandon, what happened?
Did Dani do something?
Excuse me?
Brandon was in a vulnerable position...
No, no, no.
I want to hear it from him.
The night you kicked Dani out of the house,
she came back to get her stuff,
and I...
...I had a few beers.
And my audition for symphony was the next day,
so she, uh...
told me to go to bed, sleep it off,
so she helped me undress...
...and...
...and it just sort of happened.
What happened?
We had sex.
What the hell do you mean you had sex?
Obviously he was seduced.
No, I was... I was drunk, and I wasn't thinking.
It's my fault.
Drunk? You were drunk? Did Dani give you the booze?
No, no, I was upset and...
Oh, my God, I can't believe you did not break up with that woman
when you had the chance.
You knew that she could not be trusted,
but you are so pathetic!
So this is my fault?
I didn't say that it was your fault, but I'm just saying...
That was exactly what you said.
You said that I didn't break up with her.
I can't believe that I let you have custody.
Oh, Brandon's been so perfect under your rule.
Stop it!
God, I never should have told you.
Brandon!
Brandon!
Brandon! I'm so...
Let him go.
What the hell is wrong with you guys?
Stef, why are you acting like this is Mike's fault?
And Mike, I know that you are hurt
and this is confusing as hell,
but can't you see what this is doing to your son?
Hey, I'm taking off.
Am I seeing you tonight?
Oh, no, remember?
I have that dinner at Coach's house.
Dinner?
I told you.
The one where he gives out all the goofy awards and stuff?
And somebody is getting "Most Improved," Right?
That's the rumor.
Is Emma gonna be there?
This is a team dinner, and she's on the team.
OK, let's go!
Call me later?
Promise.
We don't have time to mess around today.
Competition season starts this month,
and we are not losing this year.
And here's the thing: We need to talk dollars.
Our first competition is in L.A.,
and the truth is, we don't have enough money for everyone to go.
We don't?
At least one of us, and maybe even two, can't go.
Well, what if we have like a car wash or something?
We're not allowed, remember?
Clubs and teams can't do any "Extra" Fundraising.
So, if you're planning on holding anything back
in rehearsal today... don't.
All right, let's get started.
Hayley, you lead the warm-up.
Callie, you wanna try?
No?
Mm-mm, no.
Jude, how about you?
Come on! Get in here!
What are you gonna hit, an iceberg?
Get up there.
There you go.
Feels good, right? Steering the ship?
Oh, look out! I'm kidding.
I was kidding. I was kidding, relax.
How do you know where you're going?
Oh, I have this GPS right here.
Have you ever gotten lost?
Ah, once, yeah, when I was sailing.
Really?
Yeah, I got lost in some really rough water,
but actually between us, it was pretty awesome.
Sounds pretty terrible.
No, no, it was an adventure.
I mean, was I scared? Yeah, I was.
But, you know, sometimes you just have to let go,
give up control, turn it over to the stars.
You know?
Hey, Jude...
Listen, I know learning that Callie had this
whole "other family" has been crazy,
but I don't want you to be scared.
I'm not gonna lie to you, I wanna get to know Callie.
And you, too, if you're open to it.
But I'm never gonna try and replace your father.
And no matter what, you and Callie still share that,
OK? And you always will.
演唱者 Christina Perr
Hey, back row?
Try and land that floor work clean, please?
You look like you're having a seizure.
Ignore her, she's just stressed.
OK, let's take it from the top of the second section.
Five, six, seven, eight.
Mariana, can you come here, please?
Tia, can you show her how to do the floor work, please?
That is how you do it.
If you can't land it like that,
then you're not going to competition.
OK, take five.
And "Five" Means five, people.
Hey, look, it just takes time. OK, you'll get it.
I just...I don't want to get cut from the team.
Well, I mean, I happy to... you know, work on it with you.
If you want.
Yeah?
OK, so it's...
It's just drag, hands, sweep it to the floor.
OK, but you gotta trust. OK, try it.
No, see, you gotta go for it.
OK, you're holding yourself back.
I don't know. I guess...
...all the contemporary and the hip-hop we've been doing lately
just doesn't come as natural to me.
Excuse me?
You know what I mean.
Uh, no, I'm afraid I don't. Do you care to explain?
Well, I mean, you're just so good,
you make the rest of us look bad.
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
Well, I mean, you could try to blend in.
This is a dance team, you know?
What? Should I dye my hair?
You know what? Um, why don't you just work it out on your own.
Good luck.
B?
I'm glad you told us.
I'm not.
You understand that Dani was the adult in this situation.
And that you're a minor.
Yes.
And that means that what happened was illegal.
Mom...
You're the victim here. B.
I'm not a victim.
Honey, I handle a lot of these cases,
and it is common that the boys don't think they've been raped.
The difference is that I'm not one of your cases.
I was there. I know what I did.
And I'd appreciate it if you'd stop telling me
how I should feel about it.
I get that you might not see it this way now...
...but Dani broke the law and she needs to be prosecuted.
Well, I'm not gonna cooperate.
I'll say you're lying or that I made it up.
This is... completely humiliating.
I'm not telling the police, and you can't make me.
I love your jeans.
Oh, thanks.
I wanna get some like those, Mom.
OK, we'll see what we can find.
So, tell me about your school.
It's so cool that you guys are right on the beach.
Archfield's so... uptight.
Uptight? What does that mean?
You know, the uniforms and rules and everything.
It's a lot.
Well, yeah, even though it's on the beach,
it's not really a day at one.
It's actually pretty tough,
definitely the hardest school I've ever been to.
I've been to a lot, you know?
How many?
Um, seven, I guess, all together.
Wow, I feel like such a nerd right now.
I've only been to one school my entire life.
But you love Archfield.
Not really.
Since when?
Since forever.
Well, I think Archfield sounds really cool.
Why?
I don't know. You were talking about
the trips you guys go on every year?
Where'd you go last fall?
Barcelona?
Right, Barcelona. We're not doing that at Anchor Beach.
Well, all we did was walk around the street
and go to museums and stuff.
What about all those beautiful photographs you took?
You take pictures?
Me, too.
Still, I think you're really lucky.
I'd love to go to Spain.
It seems so cool and artsy and romantic.
It might be. There weren't any boys.
Archfield's all girls.
And we're a little young for romance anyway.
You know, Callie has a boyfriend.
Oh, really?
His name's Wyatt. He's super hot.
Um, yeah, we're just taking a little break right now.
How come?
Callie, you gotta come see the engine room.
It's crazy. It's like something out of The Golden Compass.
Cool. Excuse me.
I understand you're trying to impress Callie,
but being rude to your mother is not the way to do it.
B never liked Dani.
Maybe... Maybe he's trying to get rid of her.
You know? I mean, he could be lying.
He's not lying, Mike.
Where are you going? Mike?
I just want to talk to her.
I just wanna find out what she has to say for herself.
Mike, you promised that you would stay here
and figure this out with us together.
So Brandon won't... He doesn't want us to press charges.
Well, that's not really surprising, is it?
Wait, wait, wait. Press charges for what?
For statutory rape.
You think Brandon was raped?
You think Dani raped Brandon?
Mike, you know the definition of...
Come on, Stef! He knew what he was doing.
So, he's not an adult.
He's 16!
Trust me, Dani didn't force him.
I know how a 16-year-old boy thinks.
That is not the issue here.
I can't... I can't...
Mike. Mike! You promised.
I need a minute. I'll be out back.
So was your mom bummed when she got passed over for principal?
No, um, it was for the best.
I mean, she already has a lot on her plate.
Um, wait, Lena's your mom?
Lena the vice-principal?
Yeah, I'm adopted.
Oh, um, nice.
You're lucky. I wish I was adopted.
My parents are the worst.
But what about your real parents?
I mean, do you know anything about them?
Stef and Lena are my real parents.
Right. Sorry, but you know what I mean.
No, it was a closed adoption.
I don't know anything about them.
That would drive me crazy wondering who they are.
Yeah, don't you want to find them?
You know, at least to see if you look like them?
Um, you know what I was thinking about?
How we don't have any money for the competition.
Let me talk to my mom and see what I can do.
I mean, the new principal hasn't started yet,
she's still in charge, right?
I think... I think I'm gonna stay here.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I feel a little seasick.
You guys go ahead.
We're just going to the ship's store across the marina.
I'll keep him occupied.
Yeah, great. Come on, let's go.
Well, we won't be long. Promise.
All right. Callie, wanna drive?
Yeah!
All right.
Turn the key.
All right?
Yeah, go back.
Oops! A little bit. Just a little bit.
Perfect.
OK.
Nice.
I'm in neutral, right?
Yeah, now turn it around to the right a little bit.
There you go. OK, that's cool.
And forward?
Yeah.
There you go, looking good.
Nice and slow.
Put it in reverse.
Just for a second. There you go. Perfect.
Ah, there we go. All right.
Ok.
Tie it on for us.
Here we go.
Look at that, huh? She's a natural.
All right!
All right.
I'm gonna get a few things.
OK.
I'll be back in a flash, and don't rock the boat.
He is such a nerd.
He seems like a good dad.
Yeah, he is.
You know, it must be weird for you,
just being here.
Kind of like seeing what would have happened if
our dad would have stayed with your mom.
Well, kinda, yeah.
But, you know, everything happens for a reason.
If you think about it,
if your dad would have stayed with my mom,
there'd be no Jude.
And there'd be no you.
Yeah, might not be such a bad thing.
Sounds like you and Callie found a wonderful home.
Yeah, I mean, we didn't grow up together but...
the Fosters really feel like our brothers and sisters.
And Callie's happy?
Yeah.
As happy as Callie can be, anyway.
So, um, why did she run away?
She thought they might not want to adopt both of us.
Why did she think that?
I don't know.
I mean, it's not true, right?
They still want to adopt her, right?
Oh, yeah. Totally.
They're just... waiting on you guys.
Why not?
Because those are the rules, Mariana.
People were taking advantage
and using things like bake sales and car washes
to funnel a ton of money into their own kids' programs,
and the parent board decided that it wasn't fair.
But can't you, like, bend the rules, just this once?
I mean, aren't you the acting principal?
But how would that look if I start making exceptions
for my own kids?
The answer is no. Period.
Fine, thanks for nothing.
You're welcome.
What are you doing at school on a Saturday?
Band practice.
"Someone's Little Sister"?
No, uh, the other one. Nerd band.
You?
Dance team.
How was it?
Well, um, we have competitions coming up in a couple weeks,
so Kaitlyn is on a rampage.
And we don't have enough money for everyone to go to L.A.,
so I asked my mom if she would help us raise some money
but she said no...
I love being on the team
and I just feel like they're gonna cut me as soon as...
Hey, whoa. Slow down.
Why are you looking for a backup plan?
What does that have to do with dancing?
I'm not as good as everyone else is.
So work harder.
But I'm never going to be as good as they are.
Well, not as long as you believe that you're not.
Why are you always up in my grill?
"Up in your grill?"
How about I tell you this Friday night?
Hmm, sounds fun. A movie and a lecture.
Yeah, how about we don't.
Uh, so, no movie then?
I can't believe that Mike thinks that
Dani is gonna have some miraculous explanation for this,
some "side" that he needs to hear.
Stef.
What?
You're acting like Mike is to blame here.
Do you honestly think,
if he had any inkling this was going to happen,
that he would've have asked her to move in?
Can you imagine how humiliated he must be.
I can only imagine how many red flags he ignored.
He has terrible taste in women.
He married a lesbian.
And you married a man.
We all have our blind spots, Stef.
Just don't be so hard on him.
There's only one person here to be angry with, and that's Dani.
I'm... You think that I'm hard on him?
Stef.
What?
The only person in the world
you're harder on than Mike is yourself.
Any time the kids make a mistake or, hell,
anyone you love makes a mistake,
you take it all personally, like you failed us,
like you think you should've been able to protect us
from ourselves somehow.
And I think that that extends to Mike.
But with Mike, it's even worse,
because on top of everything else, you feel guilty.
About?
About leaving, about hurting him.
Well, don't I sound like an ass.
You're not an ass, honey, not even a little bit.
You just... love hard.
That's a good thing.
But that's why Brandon came to you about this, right?
Because I'm so hard on everyone?
演唱者 Christina Perr
Hey, what are you still doing here?
Practicing.
Yeah, like you need to practice.
Look, I know...
I know you think these moves come to me naturally
because I'm black but...
I'm just kidding.
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.
So could I...
Would you... help me?
Let's do this.
Right, let's do this.
Are you OK?
No.
Me neither.
At least we agree on that.
I still don't understand how this could happen.
How I could let it happen.
But you're right about one thing, this is my fault.
It's not... It's not your fault, Mike.
I love you, Mike, I do,
and I'm really sorry that I've been so hard on you.
It's a...
Thanks but it wasn't exactly easy being married to me.
The problems in our marriage were not all your fault.
I wasn't exactly Mrs. Brady.
You had her hair, remember?
Right after we got married, the mullet?
I beg your pardon that was not a mullet.
That was a blunt, layered flip.
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that,
but I have photographic evidence.
I don't blame you for the divorce, Stef.
And we can't blame Brandon for what happened with Dani.
He made some bad decisions, like drinking for one.
I hope to God I didn't pass that on to him.
But he's sixteen.
What if this were Mariana?
She's almost sixteen.
What if she "agreed"
to have sex with a teacher at school?
Would you blame her?
I mean, what would you do?
I'd lock him up.
So why is Brandon any different?
Hey, Jude.
Get her to show you a sheet bend, she needs the practice.
I took those the summer we met.
I can't believe you held onto them.
So... Stef told me that you had some concerns
about accepting the college fund.
You don't need to feel guilty, OK?
I don't need a consolation prize or a parting gift.
I have my own plan.
That's why I'm working, to save up for college.
Well, that's great.
It's great but, you know, it's hard to work and study.
And it's gonna take you years to save up for a semester.
Your mother would have wanted you to go to college.
You know, she was always talking about...
finishing her degree.
Do you know if she ever went back?
Uh, she took a couple night classes.
Don't you think she would've wanted this for you?
Let me do this. Please, Callie, for her.
I owe her that much.
At least to help make her dreams for you come true.
Can I keep this one?
You can keep any one you want.
I'm sorta jealous you knew her then,
when she was young and had her whole life ahead of her.
Yeah.
It must've been hard to lose her so young.
Thank you.
For being so welcoming with Jude.
And... for the college fund.
I'd be stupid to turn that down, right?
I think it's time we took the kids home.
Yeah, OK. I'll get Jude.
Thanks for coming, it was a really nice day.
Tommy's here. See you later, Moms!
Don't be out late!
Hey, what's going on?
It's my parents.
What's wrong? Is everything OK?
They're getting a divorce.
I'm so, so sorry.
I just don't want to be alone tonight.
You know I have that, um, team dinner.
Oh, I forgot. I'm sorry.
Of course I can't ask you to skip it.
I'll be OK.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, wait. I'll come with you.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Just tell the guys that they don't have to come pick me up.
Thanks.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I'm so sorry.
I wish I could take it back.
Or at least tell you why I did it.
I want you to be very careful when it comes to drinking, Brandon.
I don't want you ending up like me.
God knows, I've made a lot of bad decisions
when I've been drunk.
Dad, I know how excited you were to start over...
...how much you wanted to make a life with Dani.
And I ruined it.
No, Brandon, Dani's the adult.
She had the responsibility to stop it,
no matter how it started.
And you might not feel this way, but what she did was illegal.
And we have to do something about it.
演唱者 Christina Perr
Jesus, come in here.
Hey.
So, how'd it go? The wrestling thing?
Did you win "Most Improved"?
I didn't even go.
What? Why?
Hayley stopped by. She was a total mess.
Her parents are getting divorced.
Well, she was really upset.
About what?
About the fact that her parents are getting divorced.
Why are you being so mean?
Hayley's known about this for months.
No, no. Well, it seemed like they just told her.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
How was the boat?
Um, it was pretty fun.
Yeah?
Yeah.
How was your day?
Long.
演唱者 by Aidan Hawken
So... moment of truth.
What'd you think?
To be honest...
I wish you'd never found out about them.
Well, thank you for telling me.
That wasn't that hard, was it?
Yeah, I don't have to see them again...
Wait, I'm not done.
I wish you never found out about them,
but that's not gonna change anything.
It sucks that I have to share you.
But I guess if I learned how to do it with the Fosters,
then I can do it with Sophia, too.
And... Robert and Jill,
they seem pretty nice.
You're the best, you know that?
So did you have fun today?
It's the best day ever.
Good, I'm glad.
You know, I wish we could adopt Callie.
Well, technically, we wouldn't have to adopt her,
but she's already got a family. A family that loves her.
Yeah, I know. But she's only been with them for a few months.
Maybe if she knew us longer, she could learn to love us, too.
Danielle Kirkland?
