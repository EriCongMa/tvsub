ah , the last week of school .
it &apos;s a truly magical feeling of impending freedom
as the entire student body unites in not giving a crap .
even the teachers were checked out .
all right , stop your stretching .
we &apos;re gonna watch the movie &quot; bloodsport . &quot;
not that i &apos;m complaining ,
but isn &apos;t that , like , wildly inappropriate
and has nothing to do with gym class ?
&quot; sports &quot; are in the title . leave me alone .
i got nothing left to give you kids !
you did this to me !
but for all us eighth graders ,
the last week of school meant one thing .
all right , boys and girls , today begins freshman fear week .
this is when upperclassmen
hunt down terrified incoming ninth graders
and throw them in the showers .
did he say &quot; hunt &quot; ?
balls !
no ! i made it through middle school
without using those showers !
back in the &apos; 80s ,
school policy on cruel hazing traditions
tended to be a tad more lax .
i swear , one day , they &apos;ll realize
this whole practice is completely barbaric .
you will never live to see that day !
but ... you &apos;re my brother . you &apos;re supposed to protect me .
opposite !
i &apos;ve been training for this my whole life .
every headlock , noogie , and wet willy
has led to this moment .
there has to be a way out of this .
there is , but it &apos;s not pretty .
mama ! barry &apos;s gonna hurt me !
i &apos;m here , schmoo .
he &apos;s gonna hunt me down
and throw me into the gross gym showers !
no !
yes !
no !
and then he &apos;s gonna rip my shoes off
and make me touch the floor without flip @-@ flops !
you &apos;re not athletic enough to get athlete &apos;s foot !
help me ! i &apos;m just a boy !
i got you , baby .
oh , god ! no , i don &apos;t .
it was june 2 , 1980 @-@ something ,
the end of the school year --
a moment that would live in time forever .
hey , guys .
still looking for contributions for the time capsule .
so far , we &apos;ve got one hall &amp; oates poster ,
put in by me .
i &apos;m gonna put in a naked picture of myself
so i can look back and say ,
&quot; yeah , naked rob had it . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna put myself in there .
boom ! livin &apos; in the future .
dude , it &apos;s a time capsule , not a time machine .
right ?
you &apos;re funny
and have trouble making eye contact with girls .
i like it .
all except for the haircut and the posture , but i can fix that .
thanks , i think ? hey , erica !
you want to sign my yearbook ?
i saved you precious real estate right next to my face .
fine .
yeah , you know , if you need some more time with it ,
you could just give it back to me .
okay , you &apos;re done . &quot; have a summer . &quot;
did you mean , like , &quot; good summer &quot; or --
or &quot; bitchin &apos; summer &quot; or -- or &quot; sexy summer &quot; ?
just &quot; summer . &quot;
do you think she meant it like &quot; have a summer &quot;
or &quot; have a summer &quot; ?
dude , you got to let this go .
yeah , don &apos;t be such a duckie .
such a what ?
duckie , the twerpy , lovesick best friend
who never gets molly ringwald .
that &apos;s you , bro .
pbht ! please !
if i &apos;m anyone from &quot; pretty in pink , &quot;
it &apos;s feather @-@ haired bad boy james spader .
that is delusional .
get to know yourself , bro .
geoffrey , andrew , robert ,
i need to speak to my child .
she &apos;s using our proper first names .
move it .
it &apos;s scary &apos; cause she said &quot; andrew . &quot;
what ? ! i didn &apos;t even do anything !
adam says you &apos;re gonna haze and humiliate him at school ?
oh , that . yeah , that &apos;s happening .
like heck it is ! you lay one finger on my baby --
you mean the pubescent monster standing next to you ?
take a look at him , ma . he &apos;s all grown up now .
that is not ... the , uh ...
no , that &apos;s not ...
is this true ?
no ! look at me !
actually , don &apos;t .
uh , close your eyes and imagine me from last year .
oh , my god !
he &apos;s right . my baby is going to high school .
no ! stop reeling at the passage of time !
protect me !
your voice !
i &apos;m just now hearing it for the first time .
it &apos;s like the last gasp of an old helium balloon .
no .
oh , yes .
i just broke mom &apos;s spirit , so now i can shower you .
get ready , bro .
why are you shushing me ?
that &apos;s not a shush . that &apos;s a shower sound .
what are you talking about ? this is a shower sound .
that &apos;s the ocean , bro . a shower sounds like this .
you &apos;re making a fool out of yourself !
listen to me . listen .
hi .
hello .
don &apos;t mind me . i &apos;m just having some bev time .
do you mind closing the door , please ?
mur ? your wife is sitting in the broom closet ,
sniffing a baby blanket .
that &apos;s her thing .
she sits in there and sniffs them to remind her
of when our children were babies and not the worst .
and that doesn &apos;t bother you ?
what do i know ? i &apos;m just the husband .
fine .
that &apos;s good blankie .
bevy , i know it &apos;s hard with adam going into high school ,
but you can &apos;t hide here in the closet forever .
you &apos;re right .
just -- just take this thing
and put it where i can never find it .
it &apos;s time to let go .
it doesn &apos;t appear like you are .
i &apos;m letting go .
i shouldn &apos;t have to struggle like this .
set me free .
al ! will you help me ? !
she &apos;s got superhuman strength !
take it ! i &apos;m handing it over .
she &apos;s got the forearms of a tennis pro .
take the blankie .
put your back into it .
cure me of my sickness .
as my mom was losing her safety blanket ,
my friends and i were living in danger .
are you okay , taz ?
no , man ! i &apos;m so wet , i &apos;m so cold .
they didn &apos;t even give me a towel .
if they can throw taz money in the showers ,
there &apos;s no hope for us !
we just have to come up with a plan before the bell rings .
it &apos;s too late !
why is he shushing us ?
no matter what happens , we go down together .
for sure .
no !
take him , not me !
it was every man for himself .
we tried to escape ,
but that day , we faced the greatest shower ambush
the eighth grade had ever seen !
no ! wait ! no showers !
my turtlenecks shrink when they get we @-@ e @-@ t !
those next 10 seconds lasted an eternity
as my friends were picked off one by one .
they even got taz money ... again !
no !
next thing i knew ,
i was facing off against my destiny .
maybe it was panic . maybe it was nerd rage .
maybe it was the fact
that my brother had been kicking my butt my whole life .
but right then ,
i said , &quot; no more . &quot;
what the ...
nice one , goldfarb . walk it off , goldberg .
what did i just do ?
you just became hot , freshman .
that was badass .
in that one moment , i had done the impossible !
i became awesome !
meanwhile , the school time capsule was a complete dud .
seriously ? this is why i had a sign @-@ up sheet !
why do i even bother ?
new kids on the b. , huh ?
you know , my nana says that
i look like handsome renegade donnie wahlberg .
oh , your nana is so sweet ... but ... wrong .
if you &apos;re any donnie , you &apos;re donny osmond .
clean and non @-@ threatening .
i dig that .
thanks ?
while our resident duckie was still looking for love ,
my mom was on a desperate hunt for a blankie .
what is this ? you look insane .
you haven &apos;t by chance seen a baby blanket --
uh , blue , soft , precious beyond measure --
you know , a standard blankie ?
you mean that gross , blue rag
that smells like chickenpox and nightmare sweat ?
you shut your face @-@ mouth ! but , yes , that &apos;s the one .
okay , don &apos;t freak out ...
but i took it .
oh , no , no , no , no , no !
i wrapped it around a new kids plate
and put it in a time capsule !
no ! no , no , no , no , no !
that blankie is the only thing i have
to remember my favorite baby !
first of all , ouch .
but i think this is a good thing .
your closet time is -- how do i put it ? --
sad and creepy .
this will force you to go cold turkey .
or i just dig it up first thing in the morning !
no .
yes .
no way .
all people will remember all summer
is my crazy mom digging up the school &apos;s front lawn .
good idea . you be my lookout .
don &apos;t even put that thought in your mind .
too late . look in my eyes , erica .
it &apos;s locked in .
come on , i need you .
if you do this , i promise , next year ,
i will not go storming down to the school .
seriously ? my whole senior year
without my crazy mom roaming the hallways like a blond ghost ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m promising .
we dig during first period ,
while everyone is still half asleep in class .
understand ?
you have my word , boop .
you will not humiliate me more than normal .
* we &apos;re gonna dig to get the blankie *
okay , that &apos;s -- that &apos;s enough .
* and i &apos;m gonna sniff it &apos; cause it &apos;s so snuggly *
you have a serious problem .
there were only two days left until summer ,
and that meant one thing -- nobody cared .
okay , your calculus teacher called in sick .
wish i &apos;d have thought of it .
so we &apos;re gonna watch a math @-@ based movie --
&quot; cannonball run ii . &quot;
how is that a math movie ?
&quot; ii . &quot; it &apos;s got a number in it -- math .
snuggy .
mr. coach mellor , can i go to the bathroom ?
hey , why are you going to the bathroom with a shovel ?
oh , is this a lady thing ?
no . i got to dig up the stupid time capsule .
oh , no .
i &apos;m boned .
i stashed a tape professing my love to erica
in that time capsule
so that our kids could hear it 30 years from now .
nice move , duckie .
i &apos;m not duckie ! it &apos;s romantic .
i even serenade her with the power ballad
&quot; heat of the moment &quot; by asia .
it &apos;s classic duckie , bro .
yeah .
aw , you &apos;re right ! i got to get that tape back .
how are you so good at this ?
jazzercise - builds upper @-@ body strength .
stop ! you can &apos;t dig that up !
you stop ! we have one minute till the bell rings ,
and then everyone will see us .
ooh ! there ! i see shiny metal .
we &apos;re one scoop away .
wait , wait , wait !
i &apos;ll help so i can open it first !
d @-@ d @-@ d @-@ don &apos;t worry !
i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll plug it with my body !
erica , save me !
geoff !
my tummy &apos;s drowning !
oh , my god !
beverly goldberg !
my office ... now !
may i ask what this is regarding ?
as my mom and sister
were flooding the front of the school ,
barry was drowning in embarrassment from my epic body slam .
hey , man , how &apos;s your back ?
a little sore , but i &apos;m on the mend .
thanks for asking .
that wasn &apos;t concern . that was ridicule .
you got flipped on your ass like a turtle .
jtp , i need your counsel immediately .
um ... is it cool if we talk after school ...
or later this summer ?
yeah , the thing is ,
you got body @-@ slammed by a middle schooler ,
which makes you lower than a freshman now ,
so we have to keep our distance .
you get it .
you guys can &apos;t blow me off . i &apos;m your leader . jtp !
what the hell ?
you &apos;re supposed to automatically repeat &quot; jtp . &quot;
has the entire school turned on me ?
we need to talk .
oh , god , you &apos;re breaking up with me .
no , of course not . yet .
we just need to undo what happened .
right . easy .
so , just lure adam into a public space
and dispense a swift beatdown for all to see .
done . quick question .
is there anything else i can do
that doesn &apos;t require me going near him ?
why ?
i &apos;m , like -- how would you put it ?
very afraid of him .
adam , your nerdy brother ,
who dives for cover when someone pops a balloon ?
correct .
this is a lot .
as barry was facing his cold , dark future ,
my sister was feeling the heat .
congrats . your little stunt
broke the water line leading to the locker room .
you ruined both freshman fear week
and a timeless tradition
started by the great william penn himself ,
who , after he founded this institution in 1689,
immediately threw a freshman into the showers !
oh , yeah , and , uh , there are some people
who are also very upset about their pet project .
yes , i am upset .
everything in the time capsule was completely ruined .
yes !
oh , everything except this one thing .
no !
we should throw that away just to be fair .
oh , i think this is for you .
&quot; for future wife erica schwartz .
love , your future hubby &quot; ?
really , dude ?
awkward .
geoff , for the millionth time , i don &apos;t like you that way --
not now , not in the future , not ever .
so i really am the duckie .
the dork from &quot; pretty in pink &quot; ?
yes , that &apos;s a great example . that &apos;s exactly who you are .
i think duckie &apos;s cute .
thanks .
okay , this conversation &apos;s gotten away from me .
let &apos;s just wrap it up .
both of you are suspended for the day .
called your parents .
they &apos;re on their way to pick you up .
message received . come on , schmoo .
buh @-@ buh @-@ buh @-@ bip ! i called your husband .
i &apos;m suspending you from parenting for the day .
nice try , but murray won &apos;t care unless money &apos;s involved .
here &apos;s the bill .
are you kidding me ? ! 600 bucks for a broken pipe ? !
well ... the headline here is , i saved blankie .
sure , it &apos;s lost its adam smell , but i &apos;ll just recharge it .
you can &apos;t recharge a blanket .
ho @-@ ho ! you bet i can !
i &apos;ll just sneak it into his pillowcase
or mix it in his hamper like a stew .
don &apos;t do that . don &apos;t make a hamper stew .
i just -- i need the blanket .
once they grow up , it &apos;s all i &apos;ll have .
look , i know how hard this is for you .
i do .
they &apos;re more than my world , murray .
they &apos;re my life .
if i &apos;m not mama , what am i ?
well , that &apos;s up to you .
while my mom had to figure out her place in the world ,
i was loving my new life as a cool kid .
* gummi bears *
* bouncing here and there and everywhere *
* high adventure that &apos;s beyond compare *
* they are the gummi bears
look at him sitting there , pops ,
acting like a badass street punk .
adam ?
correct .
with the cartoons and the gelatin candies ?
he thinks he &apos;s bad ? well , i &apos;ll show him who &apos;s bad .
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
why not ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m enjoying my leisure time .
if i stand up , you &apos;re gonna regret it .
i can &apos;t live this way !
you ruined my life by fighting back and winning !
hey , i needed a win !
do you realize how crappy this year has been for me ?
i lost my girlfriend , puberty was not kind to my body ,
and i got pantsed on the pull @-@ up bar ,
undies and all !
and then you tried to kick me when i was down !
no ! i was trying to help you !
by throwing me in the showers ? !
yes , idiot !
only the cool kids get hazed during fear week .
when i was your age , no one picked on me , and it sucked !
i didn &apos;t want it to suck for you , too !
i ... didn &apos;t know that .
well ... looks like next year is gonna be awesome ...
for you , anyway .
it had been a day
since i robbed barry of his pride and dignity .
he was not taking it well .
goodbye , nunchucks . i will need you no more .
find a master who &apos;s not a wussbag .
arigato , samurai sword .
this is not a place of honor . it &apos;s a place of shame .
what did you do to the boy ?
he &apos;s trying to murder that garbage can .
this isn &apos;t my fault .
did barry seriously think
i &apos;d be a nerdy little brother forever ?
actually , yes .
look at me . i &apos;m getting older and bigger .
things change .
well , no matter how big you get ,
you &apos;re always gonna be barry &apos;s little brother ,
and that means a lot to him .
he sure doesn &apos;t act like it .
trust me , he loves being your big brother .
i @-@ it &apos;s a huge part of who he is ,
and without that ... he &apos;s just not the same .
hey , big tasty , we need to talk .
whatever ! just stay away !
not that i &apos;m scared of you ,
but , please , don &apos;t put hands on me .
come on , dude ,
we both know the only reason i could body @-@ slam you
was the summer solstice .
summer what ?
you know , the one day a year
when the moon - is closest to the earth ,
which means there &apos;s less gravity ?
there is ?
yes .
that &apos;s how a nerd like me suddenly had super strength .
it &apos;s science .
science , you say ? like the kind with scientists ?
oh , sure !
with white lab coats and clipboards and safety goggles .
beakers ?
tons of beakers , yeah .
they hold them up the light and nod ?
how else would they see the chemicals ?
i knew there was no way that happened for real !
so the balance of power has been restored .
you can be you again .
it &apos;s not that easy !
the whole school witnessed this once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime moment .
it can &apos;t be undone .
actually , i think it can .
okay ! not that complicated , people .
i call your name ,
and then you go up and get the piece of paper .
but no showboating , no speeches ,
and no doing the worm , dave kim .
i am onto you .
this is america , man .
mic check , 1 , 2 . 1 , 2 .
mic check , 1 , 2 .
checkity @-@ check @-@ check .
stop checking and just talk before we get busted !
attention , william penn academy !
prepare to bear witness
to the most epic fear week prank of all time .
eighth graders , welcome to high school .
go kick some ass .
i &apos;m back , baby .
that day ,
i helped my brother repair his damaged rep
in one fell swoop .
no ! this is my graduation turtleneck !
just like that , all memories of my brother getting body @-@ slammed
were completely washed away .
i &apos;m not a freshman ! i &apos;m the principal , damn it !
it &apos;s not funny when it happens to you !
dude , goldberg just showered the whole eighth grade !
no way !
legendary !
classic tasty !
growing up , we all have
those magical moments etched in stone .
for barry norman goldberg , his moment was now .
middle school &apos;s over , losers !
oh , my god , he &apos;s right ! middle school &apos;s over !
i think next year &apos;s gonna be pretty damn awesome .
i &apos;m happy for you .
for both of us .
i &apos;ll make sure of it .
but until then ...
wait . what are you ...
jtp !
jtp !
i want all of you to go back to class !
all of you !
let it happen , earl .
this prank deserves our respect . let it happen .
turns out , freshman fear week
was one of the best weeks of my life .
we not only survived the rite of passage ,
we soared right through it .
* &apos; cause it &apos;s the heat of the moment *
* heat of the moment *
guys , you &apos;ve got to hear this tape
that geoff schwartz made me .
he , like , rambles on about how special i am .
such a dork .
enough .
what ?
all year , you &apos;ve been saying you don &apos;t like the guy .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i don &apos;t .
what ?
but i don &apos;t . i don &apos;t like geoff schwartz .
it &apos;s crazy how sometimes
your life can change in a flash ...
and all the things you were blind to or refuse to admit
are suddenly staring you right in the face .
damn it , i like stupid geoff schwartz .
and just like that , everything suddenly falls into place ...
uh , geoff , can we t--
come on , sweetie , we got to get to blockbuster .
... even if it &apos;s not the way you thought it would .
hey , do you need something ?
it &apos;s ... nothing .
uh , h @-@ have a great summer .
yeah , have a summer
yeah , growing up is tough ...
but no matter how hard it gets ,
you can always look forward to the future .
how do i look ?
like my big boy .
my big man .
for me , i didn &apos;t know what life would bring .
and , sure , that was scary .
but for the first time , i wasn &apos;t so afraid .
congratulations , graduating middle @-@ school class of 198--
it was the end of an era ...
you &apos;re the cutest !
... and the start of a brand @-@ new one ...
oh , just look at him .
we are gonna have so much fun in high school .
&quot; we &quot; ?
you know , you were right .
i do need a life outside the house ,
and that is why i &apos;m gonna get my teaching certificate .
what have you done , murray ?
... in more ways than one .
oh , and i want this to be a surprise ,
so don &apos;t tell the kids , okay ?
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll let you deliver that message .
that &apos;s the thing about our greatest memories .
sure , we don &apos;t always remember
exactly who was there or how it happened .
all i remember was the blur of 1980 @-@ something ,
and it was awesome .
okay , as you know ,
you &apos;ve been mocking my changing voice for this entire year .
but now that i &apos;m going to high school ,
it &apos;s time for you to get out all your insults here and now
so we can bring this hurtful chapter to a close .
you sound like a harmonica in a dryer .
you sound like the child of louis armstrong
and harvey fierstein .
you sound like the tin man before he was oiled .
you sound like a witch gave a frog a voice .
stop it ! his voice is perfect .
he sounds like a beautiful angel ...
with an undescended testicle .
i regret this .
