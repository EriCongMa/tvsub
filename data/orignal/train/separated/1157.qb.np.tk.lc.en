what you got there ?
it could be evidence .
let go ! stop it !
no more questions .
mike .
back off !
what is going on ?
should i hurry up and talk fast before you move out again ?
caleb , there &apos;s someone following you .
i think it &apos;s a cop .
hanna , i &apos;ll deal with this .
are you okay ?
your panels came back
with high levels of hgh in your bloodstream .
human growth hormone ?
i &apos;ve never taken that !
why would he go back to isabel ?
do you want to be with him or not ?
because i thought that &apos;s what you wanted .
i don &apos;t .
you took this ?
we &apos;re gonna give it back .
the blow to her head isn &apos;t what killed her .
alison was buried alive .
ali &apos;s killer is dead .
i &apos;m not so sure .
should i be worried about you and this jason guy ?
what ? no !
&quot; curved , blunt weapon . &quot; that &apos;s a hockey stick , em .
be careful !
too bad . you &apos;re not gonna get a second chance , ali .
what do they know about jason ?
i &apos;m not sure , but they &apos;re definitely questioning
whether ian killed her .
where &apos;s page five ?
here &apos;s page one , two , three , four .
page six . where the hell is page five ?
wait . one second .
where were we ?
ugh ! smells like death out here .
go in there and tell spencer to hurry up .
i don &apos;t want to see dead bodies .
oh , come on , em , you love zombie movies .
i like watching them . i don &apos;t want to be in one .
they &apos;re coming over here . what do we do ?
pretend like you &apos;re supposed to be here .
so i was telling the patient in 212,
&quot; i am not shaving that ! &quot;
spencer ! time to go ! now !
did you find the missing page ?
no . i looked in the cabinet where we found ali &apos;s folder .
i even tried the coroner &apos;s computer ,
but it &apos;s password @-@ protected .
how can one page just disappear ?
my guess is someone got in here before us .
somebody like jason ?
do you think there was something in there that might have nailed him ,
something the cops overlooked ?
the only evidence we have against him
is that he &apos;s a creep .
that &apos;s not true . we know that it was a hockey stick
that probably knocked ali out ,
and jason had my stick .
the first thing i &apos;m gonna do when they take the bandages off
is go to cape may .
i can &apos;t wait to see the ocean again .
you must be so excited .
the tests will only take a few minutes .
wait , so you think that a came in here
when we weren &apos;t home and shot steroids into every cream you owned ?
yes , i do .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re going through this , em .
hey , that &apos;s mine !
i &apos;m throwing out your stuff too .
think about it .
there &apos;s no way &quot; a &quot; could know
which lotions are mine and which ones are yours .
i guess you &apos;re right .
but not that one .
i don &apos;t care if i turn into thor ,
this soy moisturizer cost me a hundred bucks .
okay , you didn &apos;t buy it , you stole it .
so what ? it &apos;s still a hundred bucks .
you know , chin hairs and back pimples
are also side effects of taking steroids .
hmm . can &apos;t be too safe .
morning , girls .
hanna , your dad called .
he wants you to call him back before you go to school .
whatever .
you haven &apos;t spoken to your dad yet ?
no , not since he left .
come on , let &apos;s go eat breakfast .
i &apos;m not hungry .
em , you &apos;ve barely eaten since you left the hospital ,
and licking the salt off of pretzels
does not count as lunch !
i can &apos;t eat anything .
i still feel queasy thinking about what &quot; a &quot;
is going to do to me next .
look , em , i get it . believe me , i do .
but we can &apos;t let &quot; a &quot; control us like this .
the best thing for you to do is just ...
try to put it out of your mind .
艾米丽 · 菲尔兹 检查结果
hanna &apos;s right . no one owns you , em .
this bitch is just trying to scare you .
well , it &apos;s working .
did you find out why your brother broke into my garage ?
he &apos;s not talking to me ... or anybody .
he won &apos;t even return calls from his best friend .
what &apos;s going on with him ?
i have no idea .
my parents , they keep turning to me ,
thinking i &apos;m gonna have the answers .
what &apos;s he doing here ?
he counsels kids on substance abuse .
why is he waving at you ?
cause he had dinner at my house the other night .
did something happen at this dinner
that you didn &apos;t tell us about ?
no .
then why are you blushing ?
because i had a dream about him last night , okay ?
stop asking questions .
what kind of a dream ?
we were in bed , naked .
he tried to kiss me , and then i woke up .
oh , my god , how could you ?
i can &apos;t control what my brain does when i &apos;m sleeping !
aria , he might be a killer !
jason is no more dangerous than
we thought toby was a few months ago .
okay , toby was never linked to a weapon
that could have dented ali &apos;s skull .
&quot; could have &quot; doesn &apos;t mean he did .
look , i can see why you &apos;re attracted to him .
he &apos;s mysterious and wounded ,
and we all know you love to fix things ,
but you &apos;re playing with fire .
and besides , why are you dreaming about jason
when you already have ezra ?
&apos;cause i don &apos;t ...
have ezra .
i just thought it was gonna be so much easier
when he went to hollis .
it seems like every time we start to take a step forward ,
someone or something gets in our way .
you guys love each other .
you just need to find a way to connect again .
can we keep this conversation between us ?
if you promise to stay away from jason .
i just spoke to your father again .
you never called him back .
he wants you to talk to isabel .
isabel ? why ?
she needs to schedule a fitting for your bridesmaid &apos;s dress .
no , i &apos;m not gonna be a bridesmaid .
it &apos;s a nice gesture .
you know , i don &apos;t even know the woman .
it &apos;s too weird .
do what you want .
whatever you decide ,
you need to call your father back .
tell him yourself .
fine .
she &apos;s getting tested to see if she qualifies
for a prosthetic cornea transplant .
english , please .
they &apos;re gonna see if they can replace
the damaged part of her eyes .
what are we talking about ?
jenna .
they &apos;re taking out her eyeballs ?
no , it &apos;s not the whole eyeball .
it &apos;s just the flap over the pupil .
could we not talk about eye flaps
while we &apos;re eating , please ?
they really think that this can work ?
i don &apos;t know .
toby says she still needs to take more tests
to see if she qualifies , but ... it &apos;s possible .
so , if jenna gets her sight back ,
does that mean that we &apos;re off the hook for ...
no . i mean , guilt @-@ wise , maybe ,
but if you break somebody &apos;s leg with a baseball bat ,
even if that leg heals , you could still be charged with assault .
she wouldn &apos;t come after us ...
she still thinks we have ali &apos;s tape .
but we don &apos;t .
and that &apos;ll be much easier for her to figure out if she can see .
guys , maybe if she can see again ,
we can stop all this whispering .
she &apos;ll lose her taste for revenge .
yeah , or things could get worse .
it &apos;s already so bad . how can it get worse ?
well , for one , she will be able to aim a gun .
look , spencer &apos;s right .
jenna &apos;s scary enough with four senses .
can you imagine what she &apos;s gonna
do to us with all five ?
you do not go in there , you understand ?
sweets for my sweet .
chocolate chip . my favorite .
please tell me you can eat these .
as long as that &apos;s not jalapeno frosting .
i &apos;m ashley .
this is hanna &apos;s mom . this is samara .
nice to meet you , samara .
nice to meet you .
do you want to go inside ?
actually , i can &apos;t stay long .
i have to run to a campus pride meeting ,
but i wanted to tell you that quinn &apos;s mom got sick ,
so we can &apos;t hang at her house tonight .
no way . i was looking forward to it .
i was dying for you to meet my friends .
you &apos;re more than welcome to have your friends here tonight .
hanna and i will both be out ,
so you &apos;ll have the place to yourself .
that would be great .
okay .
i &apos;ll call you later .
that was really nice of you to offer ,
but we can find somewhere else to go .
emily , this is your home too .
i want you to feel comfortable having your friends over .
more importantly , i want you to feel
comfortable being yourself . understand ?
yeah . i do .
the same rules for hanna applied for you !
no girlfriends allowed in the bedroom .
just girl friends .
wait , how do i know the difference ?
i &apos;ll let you know .
okay .
why is it so hot here ?
aren &apos;t you hot ?
i am now .
i &apos;ve been thinking ...
that we could use some alone time .
how do you lock this thing ?
uh , it doesn &apos;t lock .
oh , man !
i @-@ i have class in 15 minutes .
that &apos;s plenty of time .
maybe this isn &apos;t such a good idea .
um , i think ...
that you spend entirely too much time thinking .
don &apos;t you think ?
yeah .
i &apos;m telling you , jason is hiding something in there .
like what ?
i don &apos;t know ...
but he ran across that yard like his head was on fire .
he did not want that guy going in the shed .
listen , anyway , um ...
i gotta go . i @-@ i &apos;ll call you later .
my number &apos;s on there ,
in case you want to call me , okay ?
good luck .
thanks .
hey
hey , what &apos;s going on ?
why is he back ?
who ?
him .
that &apos;s the cop who was stalking you .
hanna , he &apos;s not a cop . he &apos;s a private investigator .
well , what does he want ?
he was hired by somebody to find me .
who ?
my mother .
full house , again .
damn , em , you cleaned up !
girl , you suck at this game !
deal me out . i &apos;ll go get dessert .
wait , em , help me . i &apos;m down to my last dollar .
keep these .
i &apos;ll take one .
i &apos;m feeling luckier . thanks , em .
they love you . i knew they would .
okay , let &apos;s go .
yum !
exactly what i wanted .
it &apos;s really good .
ah , did you start without me ?
曝光你的检查结果 -a
you know i like their frosting .
what do you mean it was buried in the back yard ?
toby found it and gave it to dad .
w @-@ where is your hockey stick now ?
dad burned it ,
in the fireplace . it &apos;s gone .
mom , why aren &apos;t you upset by this ?
i &apos;m sure he had a good reason for doing it .
like what ?
like he probably got scared !
after all that we &apos;ve gone through ,
i think that ... that &apos;s understandable .
scared of what ?
you think this had something to do with ali ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
but if i found a stick in the yard ,
i would have probably burned it too .
i &apos;m guessing he assumed ian planted it there .
we all know that ian was trying to frame you .
what if it wasn &apos;t ian that was trying to frame me ?
of course it was ian .
he confessed . he &apos;s dead .
case closed .
sweetie , can you finish making the salad ?
i think i left my phone in the car .
mom , why is dad so upset that jason &apos;s back ?
all you need to know is that the dilaurentis family
is not to be trusted ,
jason included .
you think that &quot; a &quot; was outside ?
somebody is watching us .
i don &apos;t know how , but they are .
aria , what am i supposed to do ?
we can &apos;t play cards forever .
emily ...
if those lab results get out ,
i will be permanently screwed .
i will never get to swim on a team again .
you &apos;re playing poker . bluff .
that &apos;s easy for you to say .
it &apos;s not your relationship &quot; a &quot; is kicking around .
i ... think i &apos;ve had a couple of pretty good kicks along the way .
i &apos;m sorry . yes . of course you have .
this is awful .
hey ... how &apos;s your stomach ?
it &apos;s the least of my problems .
if you end up back in the hospital , then &quot; a &quot; really wins .
come on , em . it &apos;s your turn .
i @-@ i gotta go .
well , call me ... later , tomorrow , whenever . okay ?
yeah , i will . thanks .
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d still be here .
are we picking up where we left off ?
i thought we could finish our talk .
okay . what &apos;s this ?
this is a gourmet supper
from the finest vending machines in the building .
mmm , &quot; certified fresh till 2015 . &quot;
would you like to decant the cream soda ?
what ?
aria , is ... something going on here ?
i certainly hope so .
i mean , aside from what &apos;s going on here .
i ... i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m talking about you being so , uh ...
i &apos;m just happy !
i am . i &apos;m really happy . i don &apos;t want to keep that to myself .
cheers .
one more game ?
there are still more cupcakes .
not me .
one more , and they &apos;ll be able to see my ass in philly .
yeah . sorry , em , we gotta go .
my curfew &apos;s 12 : 30 .
okay .
uh , zoey ... you forgot something .
what &apos;s this ?
my number .
oh , um , thanks .
this was so worth the wait .
i wish you could stay over every night .
you can &apos;t stop thinking about me , can you ?
i think that &apos;s her .
the caption says claudia dawson .
wow . she &apos;s really pretty .
does it say if those are her kids ?
yep . james is on the left and clay is on the right .
they look happy .
hey , looks can be deceiving .
there are plenty of pictures of me smiling with my dad ,
but i was just being bribed with tubs of chunky monkey .
montecito ?
so she &apos;s rich now too .
not everyone there is .
just because oprah lives there .
人称 &quot; 脱口秀女皇 &quot;
so , are you gonna call her ?
i &apos;m starved .
you have anything to eat ?
you don &apos;t really have much food .
can we order a pizza or something ?
sure .
uh ... cheese or pepperoni ?
whatever .
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna pick it up .
quinn told samara what she saw . i know it .
what could she have told her ?
i must have looked like i was giving zoe my number .
em , you were giving zoe your number .
i &apos;m better bluffing at cards .
look , you have to call samara .
she &apos;s called twice already .
i &apos;m afraid to pick up .
so call her back .
look , if quinn really did tell her something ,
you &apos;re only making it worse by not talking to her .
i &apos;m sorry i came over so early .
were you up ?
oh , i was up !
another jason dream ?
what i wouldn &apos;t give for just a nice , simple nightmare ,
something with a lot of spiders .
it was just a dream . it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
i &apos;m not ... thinking about him .
when people show up in your dreams ,
it &apos;s ... not because they want something from you ,
because you want something from them .
i have ezra .
i don &apos;t want anything from jason .
byron and i will take turns staying with him ,
and hopefully we &apos;ll be able to get a handle
on what &apos;s going on .
uh , he should be back thursday ,
maybe friday at the latest .
okay , thanks , jean .
what was that about ?
just letting mike &apos;s guidance counselor know
what our plan is .
wait . our plan was that
mike was gonna stay home from school for one day .
now , does he think he &apos;s staying home next week too ?
i told him he needed a few days that ...
where is he now ?
he &apos;s in his room .
byron , wait ...
before you barrel in there ...
why are we indulging him ?
because i don &apos;t think punishing him
any further right now is the answer .
okay , we know why he &apos;s acting out .
he made that perfectly clear to me .
no , listen . ella , he did not break into a house
because of you .
okay , he cannot blame his behavior
on anyone but himself .
i &apos;m just saying , if you want him to open up
and let us know what &apos;s going on ,
alienating him is probably not the best approach .
well ... he &apos;s got to get back to school .
i &apos;m not sure he &apos;s there when he &apos;s there .
i spoke to a few of his teachers , and he &apos;s ...
he &apos;s completely checked out .
then it is our job to get him to check back in .
mike ? come on . open up .
why is this door locked ?
come on , open the door--
you sleeping ?
hm ? no .
are you not feeling well ?
mike .
mike .
i want you to come downstairs , all right ?
your mother and i would like to talk to you .
about ?
about everything .
about why you broke into that house .
why you don &apos;t want to go to school .
why you &apos;re locking your door .
can you turn that light off ?
it &apos;s bugging me .
we &apos;re--
we &apos;re gonna be having dinner soon .
i &apos;d like it if you &apos;d come down and join us .
the light ?
this door ,
it has to stay unlocked .
you know the rule .
did you think i wouldn &apos;t find out ?
do you want something to drink ?
was it because at the fashion show
i told you i wasn &apos;t ready to be exclusive ?
did you just do it to spite me ?
no , of course not .
look , if you want to date other people ,
just say , but don &apos;t hit on my friends !
i don &apos;t want to date anybody else , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry if it came off that way .
came off that way ? you practically asked zoe out !
i gave her my number so we could hang out
as friends . that &apos;s it .
you know , she didn &apos;t even tell me . quinn did !
look , can we just forget this happened
and go to the movies ?
you slipped her your number after i left .
what did you expect me to think ?
i was caught up in the moment .
that was ... me trying to connect with your friends .
you know , until you give me a real answer ,
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
your dad let me in . he said you &apos;d be down in a minute .
what are you doing here ?
uh ... i wanted to give you this .
&quot; nico stamos . &quot;
cramer hill youth center ?
yeah , i met him at a counseling seminar earlier today .
i figured if mike was open to it ,
he might be able to help--
wait ,
what did you tell him about mike ?
not much . why ?
i &apos;m-- i &apos;m just not sure
that my parents want the whole world--
i didn &apos;t ... tell him about the police . i figured ...
um ... thanks .
i did tell him that you were worried about him , though .
worried was last week .
you know what ?
i have this huge history test tomorrow , and i ...
tomorrow &apos;s sunday .
right . i meant monday .
i &apos;m really behind ,
and mr. banks really piled it on this week .
doesn &apos;t mr. banks teach biology ?
he does .
that &apos;s right .
have a test in biology too .
it &apos;s a big day on monday , so ...
thanks for stopping by .
bye .
you know , you are the worst delivery guy
in the history of pizza .
sorry . i got sidetracked .
mind if i sit ?
she had two other sons ...
while i was living in foster homes .
why didn &apos;t she come get me sooner ?
i don &apos;t know .
but maybe she wants to make it up to you now .
you can &apos;t make up for something like that .
look , i know that you &apos;re angry ,
but don &apos;t you want to at least hear her out ?
you &apos;ve no idea what was going on in her life then .
i don &apos;t want to know .
yes , you do .
caleb , it has tortured you for 12 years .
find out what really happened
so at the very least you can stop guessing .
look , if you call her , the worst that can happen
is that you never speak to her again .
the best that could happen
is that you actually get to know her .
and both are better than what you &apos;re doing right now .
we should be over there now .
i saw him leave a half an hour ago .
em , did you hear me ?
sorry , what ?
look , things aren &apos;t over between you and samara .
you &apos;ll find a way to explain what happened .
yeah ? how do you explain &quot; a &quot; ?
mom .
hmm ?
you should really get going .
you don &apos;t want to hit rush hour .
it &apos;s saturday , honey . there won &apos;t be any traffic .
i heard that they were doing construction on the bridge .
oh , i was just on it yesterday .
there &apos;s no work being done .
mom , now what are you doing ?
your sister wants me to bring her
that navy burberry coat .
melissa &apos;s back ?
no , she &apos;s staying in philly at her condo .
it &apos;s better for her to be away from rosewood right now .
honey , do you have any idea where she left it ?
it could be anywhere , but i &apos;ll find it ,
and you can give it to her next week .
you seem tense . everything okay ?
yeah . no , everything &apos;s fine .
i just don &apos;t want you to be late for dinner .
you know how melissa gets
when her blood sugar drops .
mm . all right , girls , i probably should get going .
have a good night .
i left some money on the counter for dinner .
bye , mrs. hastings .
bye , mom .
behave yourselves .
come on .
okay , what &apos;s going on ?
do we need to introduce you to decaf ?
no , it &apos;s too late for that . just ... come with me .
where ?
to find out what jason is hiding .
that smells good .
i take it that went well .
no , it didn &apos;t .
we didn &apos;t talk .
what do you mean ? what happened ?
i don &apos;t think we should be giving mike space .
my parents gave scott space , and ...
well , you know what happened to him .
why are you bringing up scott ?
because when i went up to talk to mike ,
he was rolled up in a blanket .
it was like i wasn &apos;t even there .
and ... i saw my brother .
and what if there &apos;s something more going on here ?
mike is not your brother .
i &apos;ll get spoons .
look , i don &apos;t trust jason either ,
but i &apos;m not so sure breaking into his shed is a good idea .
it &apos;s not breaking in if you have a key .
what , are you jane bond now ?
got .
jason blacked out the windows on his shed .
aren &apos;t you the least bit curious why ?
we &apos;ll be in and out in five minutes .
just ... trust me .
what the hell was that ?
keep moving .
what is this place ?
ugh ! something just hit me .
it &apos;s jason &apos;s darkroom .
whose face is this ?
oh , my god , it &apos;s aria . they &apos;re all aria !
is that why jason &apos;s being so nice to mike--
so he can get close to her ?
can we just get out of here ?
my goosebumps are getting goosebumps .
jason &apos;s camera equipment .
this isn &apos;t for developing photographs ;
this is surveillance equipment !
for his house ?
for spying on people .
what are you saying ?
you think he &apos;s been watching us this whole time ?
you think he &apos;s-- ?
he &apos;s home !
just forget it ! come !
oh ! you changed your mind !
come on . the katy perry concert &apos;s about to start .
i can &apos;t watch that !
so ... what ? you came here because you missed me ?
actually , i came by to tell you that i took your advice ...
... and i called my mom .
you did ?
yeah .
and ?
we had a really good conversation .
well , what &apos;d you talk about ?
everything .
and nothing .
we didn &apos;t really go into the details of why she left me ,
but ... she did apologize for taking so long to find me .
and then she said that my ...
that my voice sounds just like my father &apos;s .
i know .
what else did she say ?
well , she really wants to see me ,
and , um , we talked about her coming here ,
and , um , it just ... made more sense for me to go there .
what , to california ?
yeah .
when ?
tonight .
tonight ?
as in now ?
i know that it seems rushed , but i just ...
i &apos;ve waited 12 years for this ,
and , after talking to her ,
i don &apos;t want to wait one more day .
no .
no , of course . i understand .
so ... what does this mean for us ?
we &apos;re gonna talk on the phone , and ...
and i &apos;ll be back .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
you say that now ,
but i &apos;ve seen pictures of montecito .
well , i have one very good reason to come back .
you .
can i at least drive you to the airport ?
mom actually arranged a car for me .
it &apos;s waiting outside .
crazy , huh ?
i think it &apos;s great .
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
good luck .
i love you .
i love you too .
aria .
taking a study break ?
more like a sugar break .
sounds like more fun than what i &apos;ve been up to .
had to buy a padlock for my shed .
somebody broke in today .
really ?
yeah .
well ... it couldn &apos;t have been mike . he ...
hasn &apos;t even left his bedroom since thursday .
i didn &apos;t go there .
listen , i ... i &apos;m glad i bumped into you .
i was hoping we could talk .
looks like they &apos;re friends .
if those two hook up and she starts
asking him about that night , and he remembers--
he won &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know that .
what are they doing now ?
oh , forget it .
soon i &apos;ll be able to see for myself .
nothing .
nothing &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s just get the hell out of here before anyone sees us .
how did jason get those pictures ?
he took them . in aria &apos;s bedroom . while she was asleep .
she has no idea how sick he is .
hanna &apos;s not picking up .
aria didn &apos;t either .
well , try her again .
look , i hope i didn &apos;t step out of bounds earlier .
i really was trying to help .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i just have a lot going on right now . so .
the truth is , i do care about your brother , but ...
i also care about you .
and ... i wanted to tell you in the off chance
that you might feel the same way .
i can &apos;t do this .
why not ?
i &apos;m not ... available .
i &apos;m sorry .
no one is available right now .
please leave your message after the tone .
dad , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m calling to see where i should go for the fitting .
okay , his car &apos;s not in the driveway .
i think he &apos;s gone .
i don &apos;t think we should go back in there .
how else are we gonna convince aria ?
okay , let &apos;s just get the pictures and get out .
it &apos;s gone .
look . it &apos;s open .
oh , my god .
