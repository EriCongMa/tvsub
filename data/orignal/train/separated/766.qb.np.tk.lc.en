it &apos;s my sweet spot .
sam doesn &apos;t care what i look like .
&apos;cause i &apos;m not his girlfriend .
and i &apos;m gonna kick him to the curb

and i respect your privacy .
then how &apos;d you know it was my wallet ?
well played , sam sweeny--
born in boston , six @-@ four .
i didn &apos;t know you worked in the e.r.
until i got here , though .
yeah , pediatrics .
you &apos;re a doctor for children .
it &apos;s , you know , mostly paperwork .
that &apos;s why you have so many cute cards on the wall ?
&quot; dear dr. sam ... &quot;
they call you dr. sam ?
&quot; thank you for making me better .
i love you , and so does my bunny . &quot;
nice kid , but she can &apos;t draw for crap .
i mean , she just traced bugs bunny .
i didn &apos;t know you were a , like , caring person .
same guy . same guy .
i &apos;m the same guy that did you
in that falafel restaurant , you remember ?
and a dirty one , at that .
please don &apos;t do this .
dr. sam .
don &apos;t start thinking i &apos;m some amazing guy .
this is why i don &apos;t tell girls what i do .
this doesn &apos;t change the way i feel about you .
i feel nothing . this is purely physical .
dr. sam !

you &apos;ve got so many boots .
you know who doesn &apos;t have a lot of boots ?
guys who aren &apos;t getting laid on the reg .
ooh , trust me , i know .
shelby and i agreed that we &apos;re gonna dress sexy this halloween , so ...
hopefully that &apos;ll make us want to have sex with each other .
you know , at night , i can actually feel gusts
of frigid air coming from beneath your door .
i get it , schmidt . we &apos;re in a rut .
without sex , she &apos;s not your girlfriend , okay ?
she &apos;s a friend that you buy meals for .
winston , i get it , man .
you &apos;re ... you &apos;re scared to end it .
you &apos;re just like cece .
cece &apos;s scared to end it with robby ,
because clearly she &apos;s still nuts about me .
robby &apos;s nice . good guy , man .
he always has gum .
&quot; oh , robby-- he &apos;s such a nice guy . &quot;
i &apos;ll show you nice guy .
punch him in his face .
yeah , put you in a guillotine choke hold .
and then robby &apos;s like , &quot; oh , my god ! &quot;
&quot; i can &apos;t believe this . young abraham lincoln
is choking me out in his guillotine . &quot;
you &apos;re going as young abe lincoln for halloween ?
statistically speaking , every american
thinks about abraham lincoln at least once a day .
and cece &apos;s american , so ...
thank you for that information , schmidt .
what &apos;s up , robby ?
what &apos;s up , robby , you stupid idiot ?
you had an alter ego , remember ?
the guy who &apos;d been in a coma
who woke up thinking he had invented pie .
oh , i got a great new idea for a dessert !
wait a second , what year is it ?
that &apos;s awesome you liked that .
no , i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re here .
welcome to los angeles .
l.a. , as the locals call it .
this is the city where many scenes
from the film beverly hills chihuahua were shot .
yeah , it &apos;s pretty cool .
i made you up a couch .
the double eye patch .
you trying to impress me ?
yes !
absolutely !
you kidding ?
a doctor ?
i had him pegged for a part @-@ time tennis pro
or an unemployed handsome guy .
he cares about people for a living ; it &apos;s so much hotter .
you &apos;re starting to like him now .
no , no , no , we &apos;re just coworkers .
on the night shift .
these fit great , jess .
really , thank you so much .
it &apos;s like a childhood dream come true for me .
to be a ninja turtle .
and to have a beautiful girlfriend , of course .
thank you .
what am i looking at here ?
robby , man to man ,
you didn &apos;t want to wear something ,
i don &apos;t know , a little more form flattering ?
maybe like a pile of towels , the number eight ?
schmidt .
i know .
but how could i not knock down such low @-@ hanging fruit ?
speaking of low @-@ hanging fruit ,
jess , you didn &apos;t want to let out the pants a little bit ?
no .
not even a touch ?
no .
you want to look at your work ?
looks great .
not to an eight @-@ year @-@ old child .
who &apos;s just staring right down the barrel .
enough .
are you guys coming to
the halloween festivities tomorrow ?
actually , we &apos;re ...
i think you should come .
it &apos;s for charity .
you like charity , robby , right ?
yeah , sure . like cece dating you .
awesome . um ...
why not ?
no . i mean ,
we have that thing ...
don &apos;t worry about my friends .
i would love to hang out with your friends .
i think we should do it , because i want to wear this costume out .
you know what i mean ? so i say yes .
just , uh , keep the pumpkins away from me , okay ?
i kind of cut myself last halloween .
i mean , not on a knife .
i @-@ i , you know , i cut myself on the pumpkin .
you should &apos;ve made a move in college .
no , i didn &apos;t have moves , amelia .
my moves were
singing to you and trying to give you back rubs and ...
i do remember you picking a lot of eyelashes off my cheeks .
didn &apos;t you think it was weird that i kept showing up at your door ,
telling you i had a family tragedy ?
how many grandparents did you think i had ?
i had a bad bag of moves , lady .
well , they &apos;re not bad any more , nick miller .
ah , that &apos;s great .

well , i wish i hadn &apos;t have seen that .
you wish you hadn &apos;t seen that ?
i wish i hadn &apos;t seen ...

i wanted this for so long with her ,
and now ... it &apos;s just too much .
you know ?
you want to know why i don &apos;t like haunted houses ?
why ?
because they &apos;re just like relationships .
you walk in all confident ,
and then once you get in ,
it &apos;s not what you thought it was gonna be , and it &apos;s scary .
nice , you &apos;ve liked her for a long time .

yeah , well , you tried to head @-@ butt me with your forehead .
yeah , i know i was trying to head @-@ butt you .
okay , listen .
i think there &apos;s two options here .
we can either go the way that things have been going
and we &apos;re going to have a big problem ,
or we can just knock this off and let &apos;s be friends , okay ?
i &apos;m sorry .

do you want me to go ?
you punch a girl ?
yes , i did . uh , i &apos;m a coward .
i &apos;m scared of haunted houses .
and i &apos;m scared of you-- i always have been .
that &apos;s right . that is what i &apos;ve been trying to remember .
i was like , &quot; nick is great . &quot;
why didn &apos;t i realize it years ago ? &quot;
and it &apos;s because you could not tell me how you felt .
so you always knew i liked you ?
you drove me home every thanksgiving break .
you lived in chicago ; i lived in florida .
well , i was trying to avoid the tolls .
how do you feel about me now ?
great . good .
i can &apos;t believe that after all this time ,
you still can &apos;t be honest with me .
i &apos;m sorry , all right ? it &apos;s my fault .
okay , i fell in love with you the first time i saw you-- that &apos;s crazy .
i didn &apos;t even know you . it was just this idea of you .
and then ... it just wasn &apos;t what i thought .
and what &apos;s up with the way you kiss ?
it &apos;s like reverse cpr . it &apos;s like you &apos;re ...
i &apos;m not an idea of a person .
i &apos;m an actual person .
ready ?
one , two , three .
all right , let &apos;s try it one more time .
i think you guys deserve the couples costumes .

very nice of you to do that , schmidt .

reigning cats and dogs !
yeah !

you are so awesome !
you know , i may not actually be abraham lincoln ,
but i witnessed the emancipation
of one black guy tonight ...
from a terrible relationship .
come on .
i know i said you shouldn &apos;t put yourself out there ,
but i &apos;m glad you did .
you should be with somebody who &apos;s crazy about you , jess .
thanks , nick .
that &apos;d be really nice if it wasn &apos;t coming
from somebody who just punched me in the face .
sorry about that .
all right , you ready ?
