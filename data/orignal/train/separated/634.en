My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this, and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death.
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
Maybe your new financial advisor can help you
find your way out of the red.
Surely, Aiden, you of all people should know
the Graysons are completely bankrupt!
Together we're going to destroy that little bitch.
Victoria took the bait.
Thank you for coming back.
Well, I knew that if you reached out to me,
I must be the only one you could turn to.
My mother warned me not to trust you.
Yet here you are.
Well, I like to draw my own conclusions.
Amanda Clarke was my friend.
She knew what Conrad did to her father.
I want you to persuade him to confess.
I'm turning myself in to the authorities.
If you get in that car,
I swear it'll be the last thing you do!
Father Paul!
Emily.
Conrad Grayson involved in M.V.A.,
Blood pressure--170/100, pulse--120,
Possible head trauma. C.T. Scan recommended.
Paul Whitley B.P.-- 40 over palp,
possible spinal injury,
significant blood lost at scene.
Please hold on.
You need to wait here.
Victoria, you're crying.
"Adam and Eve banished from Eden."
It's my first Randolph.
It's prophetic,
as Conrad was the serpent all along,
dragging me to hell with him.
Now he's going to do something
to destroy me and this entire family.
Losing our fortune proved insufficient.
Now he's going to die and leave me
with the shame of his sins.
God... have mercy on my soul.
You act like you're-- you're bound to Conrad
with no way out.
You are Vicky Harper--
The woman who made an enviable life from nothing.
That's who I was once.
That's who you are now.
And I know that...
because you and I are the same.
Now you have everything you need
to change your life right here in this room.
Sell this collection.
And we'll leave the Hamptons.
I have tried to leave him so many times.
But I can't abandon Charlotte and Daniel
to deal with Conrad's mess.
My children need me now more than ever.
Mrs. Grayson?
There's been an accident.
You get a chance to look over my remodel ideas, J.P.?
Success is all about branding.
Well, branding can keep calling me "Jack."
But I did check 'em out, and I'm down for a few changes.
What's all this?
Invitations to the wedding of the century.
Maid of honor reporting for duty.
I thought you were into it.
Emily and I have hit a few bumps lately.
I'm trying the bygones thing
because she's marrying my brother in eight weeks.
But sometimes, I swear, I don't know the real Emily.
So are you thinking of asking Margaux to the wedding?
I'm not going to the wedding.
Not going?
I need a little break from Emily Thorne.
We're losing him.
Still in v-tach.
Charge again. Clear!
Come on, come on.
He's still in v-tach. Nothing.
Damn it.
Time of death--23:36.
Emily.
Any news? I...
I haven't heard much of anything out here.
Father Paul's gone.
He went into cardiac arrest...
and they couldn't save him.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah, he was a good man.
He was taken too soon.
You know, Victoria didn't say much about him
on the drive over here...
or about Conrad, for what it's worth.
Have you seen him?
No.
Daniel made it clear I wasn't needed in the room.
He... said it was family only.
I know when I'm not welcome.
The Graysons tend to close ranks in moments like these.
Just tell my mother I'll be at the manor
if she needs me.
Just please, try Charlotte again.
She must not have got my messages,
as I'm sure she would be here.
Still, I'd rather she not learn about my accident on...
Twitter.
Oh, and yet you were so eager to air your confession
for all the world to hear on the evening news.
It seems that your father's dying wish
is to put a final nail in the family coffin
by publicly admitting to framing David Clarke.
That's where he was headed.
Why on earth would you confess?
Because my time with Paul inspired a spiritual conversion.
Though this near death experience
may have put an end to that rationally conceived notion.
You better hope he survives,
because the doctors ordered you not to drive with Huntington's.
Father Paul's dead.
I knew it was a bad choice.
He's very persuasive.
Look, I bought that Ferrari new in '86.
It was a gift to myself for cracking the Forbes 100.
Anyway, Paul and I test drove it together,
and he really showed me what that car could do.
Are you rehearsing the sob story you're planning on telling
at your manslaughttrial?
No, my dear, I merely want you to understand
how Father Paul came to be behind the wheel
at the time of the accident.
What?
He wanted to relive a memory.
It breaks my heart that I let him.
I will not be complicit
in your ridiculously obvious lie.
And good luck getting the authorities
to swallow this tripe.
Em... Em, you-- you were first on the scene.
What did you see?
The car was on fire.
Father Paul's body was thrown about 15 feet in front of it.
And where was I?
You came up from behind me.
I was nowhere near the driver's side of the vehicle, correct?
Yes.
Nowhere near.
You are my guardian angel, Emily.
Lord knows where I'd be without you.
Well, the man's s a survivor.
That's because Conrad caused the accident.
I don't think he ever intended to confess,
and he made damn sure that Father Paul didn't either.
Yeah, I don't know, Ems.
I mean, murder by auto accident?
Conrad is pretty psychotic,
but why would he risk his own life?
Well, he's not afraid to die.
That's a side effect of convincing somebody
that they've got a terminal disease.
Can we just talk about the elephant in the mansion?
That maybe the crash was due to another
fake Huntington's Em-isode?
I lowered his dosage yesterday
so he'd be healthy enough to turn himself in.
God, if Conrad would have been too ill to drive...
Don't blame yourself.
I need to find the car, prove that Conrad was driving.
Can you get me into the police database?
Um, with, uh, my library card?
Ems, tech time-out, remember?
Plus I, uh,
have my own Grayson revenge-agenda this week.
Aiden, since you're living at the manor,
keep your ears peeled around Conrad.
And in the meantime...
replace his medication with these.
Maybe there's a chance he'll still confess
if he thinks he's at death's door.
Thank goodness Conrad survived.
With nary a lasting injury.
In fact, he's being released from the hospital this morning.
How much more can the poor man endure?
Trust me, Sheila, that man will always rise above.
Oh, look at what you've accomplished.
Turning this into the Hamptons' premiere gallery.
Having Victoria Grayson as a loyal customer
helped cement this gallery's reputation.
I'm honored to have helped you build your collection.
And I trust we've built a friendship over the years as well.
Of course we have.
Well, I can only hope that you'll help in turn.
I used to be an art consultant many years ago.
And now that I'm an empty nester
with a husband incapable of working,
I was looking to reignite my passion.
Darling, I heard all about your money troubles.
So are you offering up your services or...
asking me for a job?
It's the latter.
Well, then the job is yours.
And, of course, we'll have a welcome reception
to fete your renaissance.
Oh, this announcement will bring tons of traffic into the gallery.
I trust you'll call and invite all your friends
to come and see the new... improved Victoria Grayson.
I will.
And thank you, Sheila.
I don't know how to repay such a kindness.
Sorry to interrupt your meeting,
But I needed to see you.
Um, can we talk about the accident for a second?
Oh, perfect timing then. This is Detective March.
He'll be handling the investigation.
Emily Thorne.
That's funny, because I was the first on the scene,
And no one's taken my statement.
I already gave it to him.
Yeah, they're pretty clear about what happened.
Yeah, seems there was driver error
on Father Paul's part.
He just took the curve too fast.
Lost control.
And for his quick response...
The Graysons are proud to support the local authorities.
Well, then I guess that's settled.
Yeah, it will be. I'll see you later, okay?
Yeah.
Um, Miss Thorne? Miss thorne?
Did Mr. Grayson look almost finished?
Because the magazine launches next week,
and his publisher's bio is due to the printer in minutes.
The profile introducing Daniel to the readers of "Voulez"?
Exactly. And Ms. Lemarchal will have me fired,
unless I get at least one personal detail about him.
I'd be happy to give you a statement.
Nolan.
Patrick.
You know, for a guy with an amazing pool,
you sure do spend a lot of time at this beach club.
I'm just... trying to justify the king's ransom
I spend in membership dues.
So... what brings you to our pristine shores?
The inevitability of the tide.
What comes in must go out, right?
Thinking maybe it's time for me to move on.
Leaving the Hamptons so soon?
You ever feel like you don't belong?
Story of my life.
Enjoy the beach.
I'm gonna go for a swim.
Charlotte, dear...
Uh, could you... please call me back?
All I'm asking for is a minute of your time...
What is it, detective?
Oh, I had it moved off site. Daniel didn't tell you?
Piedmont salvage yard.
Yeah, have it taken care of quickly.
And, uh, don't call again.
Welcome home.
What the hell are you doing here?
I just moved into your pool house.
Oh, well, I just got off the phone with the police.
I'm happy to call them back.
Why?
So you can have me arrested on another trumped up charge?
Or are you scared?
Of being killed in my sleep by a coward like you?
Damn straight.
Bianca, could you please inform the staff that Mr. Mathis here
is to be denied access to the manor?
And, uh, have the doors to my suite and study
Locked at all times during his inevitably short stay.
Yes, Mr. Grayson.
So why don't you go back to your cabana?
And then prepare to keep going back over the ocean.
Well, if you still ran this house,
I... might actually be scared.
Conrad's car is at piedmont salvage yard,
And you should know that
Daniel's in the thick of it, too.
I know. I just caught him giving my statement
To the officer handling the case.
I don't know why I'm surprised, but I am.
That's because no one can be trusted.
Emily, look, I'm.. I'm sorry. I know this is
The closest you've come to clearing your father's name.
I'm not giving up.
Well, at least.. at least take a minute.
Okay, I-I know you well enough to know
that you're not okay. Just...
talk to me.
I'm fine.
I gotta go.
Look, I just wanted you to know that
I don't think Conrad's gonna confess.
I'm sorry if I got your hopes up.
Is this another one of your plans gone sideways?
No, jack. This is Conrad getting away with murder.
You know what? I shouldn't have come.
Hang on. Let me help you.
No. No way.
Emily...
This man has killed my wife. He's killed my brother.
All I ever wanted is to find a way to make him pay
for something.
Anything...
Look, jack, I need you to stay out of this.
Hey, it's jack.
I need some info.
"And Daniel Grayson has always risen above adversity
"to embrace new challenges.
"Following a drunk driving accident,
"which nearly killed his passenger,
"he saw it as a wake-up call,
"joining then rising through the ranks
of his father's company, eventually running it."
Now this has gone to print,
and will be in every copy of the first issue.
They wanted details making you
more relatable to the readers.
So you told them about my D.U.I.?
What the hell were you thinking?!
I think it shows how far you've come.
Oh, no, no, no. You're a smart woman, Emily Thorne.
This was passive-aggressive.
Hell, this was aggressive. You were...
You were trying to hurt me.
That's ridiculous.
Is it because I've been too busy with work?
Is that why? Come on. Give me a reason.
And I want the truth.
How dare you demand the truth.
You're right, Daniel. I'm not an idiot.
I know exactly what was happening this morning.
Oh, and this was in retaliation?
Did you stop for a second to think about
Why I helped my father?
Does it matter? It's disgusting.
I thought you were better than Conrad,
But you're just as wrapped up in his lies.
Yeah, right,
'cause you're such an open book. Where are you going?
I'm not doing this.
You walk out that door,
and I'm not gonna be here when you get back.
Then don't forget to turn on the alarm.
Yes, at the Sheila Lurie gallery.
Oh, Jordan, thank you for your support.
I'll see you then. Bye, now.
Still making phone calls, I see.
Well, the more clients I secure,
The faster I'll be fiscally independent from this marriage.
And I want that gallery swarming.
Although I'm loathe to endure the stares of friends
who relish my predicament.
Well, let 'em stare.
Then when you're back on top, they'll kiss your ass.
Why don't you take a walk with me on the beach?
It's where I go to clear the cobwebs.
Oh, I would love to, but I have invites to extend,
and I need to reach out to Daniel and Charlotte.
I really need their support.
Patrick.
How to dig up your skeletons.
No.
Nolan.
No technology.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Oh. Just... once...
then I can stop.
I can stop anytime.
And if I can't stop, then I can write a program...
that will make me stop.
Sweet chord of connectivity.
Come to papa.
It's beautiful.
It is.
And it's also victoria Grayson's.
So might I ask how it came to be in your hands?
Oh, um... I'm her son.
I had heard through the grapevine
that victoria's first born had... resurfaced.
And now he stands here intending...
if I catch your drift...
to fence one of her more valuable pieces?
Well, I'm leaving the Hamptons,
and I could use a little traveling money.
What can I tell you?
I'm a bastard in more ways than one.
As much as I love it, I simply can't risk
purchasing a piece of this caliber
without the proper paperwork.
It's illegal.
Hey, how's the Sultan enjoying his Pollock, by the way?
I heard about your hobby of, uh...
somehow acquiring certain rare and valuable pieces
and then privately reselling them
to high-end international buyers.
Unless, of course, the grapevine was wrong.
You said it yourself. This is a valuable piece.
How should we handle this?
You know, the more I know you, the less I know you.
Jack, what are you doing here?
You can't be here!
And you can?
I'm not just gonna sit around
and let Conrad get away with murder.
Let me deal with him.
We can fight, or we can get to work.
But I'm not going anywhere.
I think I found something.
I just took a video of the entire car.
Look at the steering wheel.
That's housing for an air bag that Conrad had installed.
Though it must have deployed when the car hit the pole.
That's why Conrad has burns on his face
and father Paul doesn't.
This could really prove that Conrad was driving,
which means that he had the air bag
removed and destroyed before they towed the car.
Jack, look, just give me your phone.
I'll download the video and take care of it.
No.
Jack--
I've been waiting for my moment
to make this bastard pay, and it's finally here.
You can't do this.
There could be consequences.
You didn't think about that when you lied to me for two years.
So either I get to tell this truth...
Or the other one.
Your call.
So... what's the 4-1-1, hon?
I found proof.
Conrad should be arrested sometime today.
Wait, wait, wait. So isn't that good news?
No. Because Jack came to the salvage yard last night
and demanded he do the honors.
I thought you promised never to pull him into this.
I didn't. He wouldn't listen.
Well, I'm not waiting around for the fallout.
Where are you headed to?
Oh, just a... quick sojourn to the sunshine state.
What are you all dolled up for?
A reception at the Sheila Lurie gallery.
It seems victoria's gotten herself a job.
So what, you're going to, uh,
support the working classless?
I did something rash.
Daniel didn't come home last night.
I figure a public forum
is the easiest place to make amends.
Are you sure you want to be around Victoria
after what just happened at my party?
It'll be fun to watch her try not to lose it.
Lucinda, you know Victoria.
Yes, we've served on several boards together over the years.
Yes.
Well, I assume you'll have no time for that
now that you're working. How unexpected.
It's a coup for me. Victoria knows her stuff.
She was my biggest customer till just a few months ago. Mm.
Browse, Lucinda.
Excuse me, ladies.
When you said you'd taken a job,
I had to see it to believe it.
Well, I'm asserting a little independence
from your father.
And I can see it had its desired effect,
as I hope you've come to support me.
Yeah, Mom, I have.
I'm actually proud of you.
Oh, sweetie.
It's a beautiful gallery, Victoria.
What are you doing here?
Well, I wanted to show my support.
I feel terrible after what happened at Nolan's party.
I'll never forget what you did to my reputation,
Nor forgive.
Maybe in time.
After all, I will be a Grayson in a few weeks.
Well, if you're looking for Daniel, he's not here.
Maybe he's still at the family suite at the Southfork Inn.
Must be trouble in paradise.
Nothing we can't work out.
Well, thank you for coming, Emily.
Feel free to leave anytime.
Well, since I'm here, I thought I'd have a look around.
I'd love to give you your first commission.
So... that's what's been up with you.
You're having problems with my brother.
We'll be fine.
Excuse me.
你去过警局了吗
Yeah, all right. Okay, well, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Detective March says you're in the clear.
Oh?
The car has been demolished.
Father Paul's body has been claimed by the monastery, and...
the case is officially closed.
Well, let's toast to that.
I gotta head over to Mom's reception.
I don't want to miss Emily.
We had a pretty bad fight last night.
Over what?
Believe it or not,
she gave "Voulez" my D.U.I. story for my bio.
You do realize that's a power play, son.
What do you mean by that?
Well, I presume you don't consider my marriage
a paragon of excellence,
but the thing that's kept the fire lit all these years
is that we know how to fight, but not surrender.
Now you go to Emily now,
and you are admitting defeat.
I see your point.
Good, because... I won't be around
to dole out these nuggets forever.
Then tell me the truth.
What really caused the crash?
Oh, I took the turn too fast.
I might have hit the clutch instead of the brake
and made poor Father Paul the first victim
of my Huntington's.
But you had the good sense to help me cover it up.
I didn't do it for you.
I can't have the family dragged through the mud
one week before my magazine launch.
I'm finally making a name for myself,
building it with hard work, not legacy.
I have something to lose now.
This is Conrad.
The humidity here is awful.
You must be from L.A.
New York.
Damn it. I'm usually right.
You know what I love about the south?
People are so friendly.
It's a product of bible belt fear.
But trust me, there are some...
less than desirable folks around here.
Like your, uh... ex-husband?
Patrick Osbourne, right?
Who the hell are you?
I-I-if he sent you here--
No, he... he didn't.
I'm just... looking into him for a friend.
Patrick is a user and a liar.
And that's all I have to say.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.
I need details.
Would, uh...
$20,000 change your mind?
I apologize in advance.
All hundreds.
What do you want to know?
This would be beautiful in your home.
and an acquisition at this price point
would be a major asset to your portfolio.
Victoria, there you are.
While I applaud your go-getter attitude,
one of the track lights has been out for ten minutes.
I'll finish up with this sale.
Sheila, can we have a word for a moment?
Excuse us.
Yes. Thank you.
I was going to do this later,
but I received a curious phone call this morning
from a friend of mine-- Jordan Sawyer.
Does that name ring a bell?
Why?
Well, you brokered the deal for him
to add a Randolph to his collection--
one he knew I possessed.
Well, I can undo that deal.
But we still have a problem.
You sold a piece of art that I own.
Now you are seasoned enough to know that
buying and selling art without the proper ownership paperwork
is larceny.
You should know that your son patrick brought it to me.
So if I go down, then so does he.
And your family does not need another scandal.
Oh, well, everyone knows about our financial situation.
So I have nothing more to lose,
but you have everything to lose.
What do you want, Victoria?
You always have an end game.
But I didn't have an end game before this.
And not even when I came to an old friend
to ask for a little grace, a little mercy.
And I helped you. I hired you.
No.
You took pleasure in my family's hardships.
And you tried to humiliate me with that little reception.
So when I found out that you sold my art behind my back,
that's when I developed an end game, as you call it.
You disappoint me.
I'm calling the police.
Please. Please, please, please, no, I...
Okay... while this started as my welcoming party,
it's now your farewell to the hamptons.
So go out there and tell everyone
that this is my gallery now...
Right after you change this bulb.
Jordan got the Randolph back to me in mint condition.
And our plan worked perfectly.
The gallery's mine.
See? I knew you still had a little Harper in you.
You took a huge risk just to make me happy.
Neither Daniel nor Charlotte
have ever made me feel so special.
Sorry I haven't returned your messages.
I just got back.
From handing over the evidence?
I've been burned too many times
by accepting what's in front of me as true.
So before I turn this in, I wanted to run it by Vince.
He's a mechanic.
We were right about the air bag.
But there's something else.
This is the brake fluid reservoir
in the trunk of Conrad's car.
And that is a puncture that Vince says
could not have been made by the impact.
Someone tampered with the brakes.
That's what caused the accident.
It doesn't matter who was driving.
I thought I had him. I thought I had him.
I have to go.
Conrad has news.
Oh. Keep me in the loop.
If I'm in danger again, I'd like to know.
What are you doing here? This is reckless.
Someone tampered with Conrad's brakes.
That's what caused the crash and killed Father Paul.
Aiden, I need to know it wasn't you.
After everything I've done, you still don't trust me?
You've gone rogue before.
Just tell me.
I didn't do it.
I came back here to help you finish this your way.
Okay.
So how did you know
that Conrad's brakes were tampered with?
There's proof. But I don't have it.
Jack does.
Wh--Porter. You--you-- you went to him, but how?
Does jack know who you really are?
How long?
Since the night of the election.
He was going to kill Conrad. I had to protect him.
I'll explain later. I'm sorry.
Well, I think Mark's father
had a huge influence on him.
Really?
What's the news?
I don't know.
My father insisted we all be here, so...
Unseasonably chilly tonight, isn't it, Emily?
While I adore performance art,
why don't you just get on with it?
I received a call from the hospital today,
asking me to come back for an MRI,
which confirmed... a shocking discovery.
I've been misdiagnosed.
And I do not, nor have I ever
suffered from Huntington's disease.
What?
How did they explain the symptoms?
Seems they were brought on by stress
and the Huntington's medication itself.
I realize now what Father Paul meant when he said
that he'd been brought back into my life
through divine intervention.
I mean, he was god's vessel to show me
that I'm meant to live a long and meaningful existence here on earth.
And Father Paul is now doubtless in heaven,
having earned his wings.
Well, maybe he's laughing at you
because you had to step down as governor for naught.
I know I certainly am.
Well, being governor
merely distracted me from my true destiny--
leading this family. And so the first step
is reclaiming my rightful position
as master of this house.
You must be happy.
Your father's misdiagnosis means you're in the clear, too.
We're gonna have one of those in a few weeks.
You sure you want it?
You questioned the type of man I am
in print... and to my face.
Sorry I questioned you.
If I had a family,
I'd do anything to protect them.
Daniel, I want nothing more than to marry you.
Why?
I don't think you ever told me why.
Because I love you.
Now come on. Let's go home.
I'm gonna stay at the Southfork again, okay?
Daniel.
See you tomorrow.
Where'd you say you found my wallet again?
Well, I went back to the beach club
after I saw you there in hopes that
I'd bump into you again.
No bump, but, uh, your wallet was there.
Lucky you, that I found it.
Why were you looking for me?
Maybe... because you intrigue me.
Victoria's mysterious son.
What on earth is he up to in the Hamptons?
And... why is he always in such a rush to leave?
What did you find out?
Something that made me happy you stayed.
That was a bit presumptuous.
Look, I'm, uh... I-I'm sorry.
I just thought, you know, you showed up at my party,
and we saw each other at the beach club,
that maybe we, uh...
We did.
Have mercy.
How about just a glass of wine?
Yeah... that, too.
So?
Well, you're not in any danger.
Conrad realized that he's not sick,
and now he thinks he beat god.
I guess there's no beating him.
Emily? What are you doing here?
I wanted to make sure you got the news
about your father.
He mentioned that you haven't called him back.
Yeah, Daniel already told me. He didn't let you know?
Uh, he's still staying at the Southfork, so...
I finished with your wedding invitations.
Though you'll probably want to save postage on one.
Here you go, Jack.
So much for your break from Emily Thorne.
Good night.
Night.
I can't believe you're still going through with this.
Jack.
What are you...
You're planning on taking them down at your wedding.
I don't want you to be there.
I deserve to be there.
I want to be there when they get what's coming to them.
No, you don't.
Go back to your life, Jack... to Carl.
You don't belong in this.
You know, I don't believe I've properly
congratulated you on your new amusement.
Well, it's more than you're doing,
and it's my ticket to freedom from you.
So get out. I've got a lot of work to do.
There's that spunk I fell in love with.
And I will leave just as soon as you
describe to me Mr. Mathis' exit plan.
So you have until breakfast to remove him,
or... I'll do it my way.
Now that would be unwise.
Aiden may be the only hope we have
of stopping Daniel from marrying Emily.
It seems that she has some inexplicable weakness for him.
God, are you still chewing that same bone, woman?
Use that tenacity to get him out of my pool house.

And I imagine I'm looking straight at him.
