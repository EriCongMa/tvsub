we laughed when you did it with the stuffing , but that &apos;s not funny .
hey , monica , i got a question . i don &apos;t see any t ator tots .

tonight &apos;s potatoes will be mashed , with lumps and in the form of tots .
all right , i &apos;m off to talk to my unborn child .
okay , mom never hit .
okay , all done .
phoebe , did you whip the pota ? ross needs lumps !
oh , l &apos; m sorry ! i just
i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .

because then they &apos;d be just like my mom used to make it , before she died .
okay . three kinds of potatoes coming up .
okay . goodbye , you guys ! thanks for everything !
oh , god , look at sorry ! i &apos;m so sorry .
an unbelievable thing happened ! underdog got away !

of course the balloon !
he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park .
i &apos;m going to the roof . who &apos;s with me ?
i can &apos;t !

almost never .
got the keys ?
okay .
anytime you &apos; re ready .

there is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage , but ....
just aim for the bump .
okay . okay . okay , here goes .
you know , i can &apos;t do this . this is
it &apos;s too weird . i feel stupid .
it &apos;s fine . you don &apos;t have to do it just because susan does it .
hello , baby . hello . hello .
the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park !
but did they have to shoot him down ? that was just mean .
right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside ...
... and juicy on the inside .
why are we standing here ?
we &apos;re waiting for you to open the door . you have the keys .
no , i don &apos;t .
yes , you do . when we left , you said , &quot; got the keys . &quot;
no , i didn &apos;t . i asked , &quot; got the keys ? &quot;
no , no , no . you said , &quot; got the keys ! &quot;
do either of you have the keys ?
the oven is on !
i &apos;ve gotta get my ticket !

and everyone &apos;s telling me , &quot; you gotta pick a major . &quot;
so on a dare , i picked paleontology .
and you have no idea what i &apos;m saying , because , face it , you &apos; re a fetus .

no , i didn &apos;t ! i wouldn &apos;t say i had the keys unless i had the keys !
that &apos;s it ! enough with the keys . no one say keys !
why would i have the keys ? !
aside from the fact you said you did ?
i didn &apos;t !
you should &apos;ve .
why ?
because !
why ?
everything &apos;s my responsibility ? isn &apos;t it enough that l &apos; m making dinner ?
everyone wants a different kind of potato , so i &apos;m making them .
does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want ? no !
no ! no !
just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions , and mario gets his t ots
it &apos;s my first thanksgiving , and l
it &apos;s all burnt , and i can &apos;t ....

shoop , shoop , shoop ....
shoop .
eww .
what ?
ugly naked guy &apos;s taking his turkey out of the oven .
who cares ?
he just sat in gravy .
oh , my god ! he &apos;s not alone .
ugly naked guy is having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal .
i gotta see this !

by all means .
all right .
who wants light cheese , and who wants dark cheese ?
i don &apos;t even want to know about the dark cheese .
does anybody wanna split this ?
i will .
you guys have to make a wish .
make a wish ?
come on , you know , thanksgiving .
you got the bigger half ! what did you wish for ?
the bigger half .
all right , i &apos;d like to propose a toast .
a little toast here . ding , ding !
this isn &apos;t the thanksgiving you planned ...
... but for me , this has been really great .
i think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting .
if you &apos;d gone to vail or if you had been with your family ...
... or if you didn &apos;t have syphilis and stuff ...
... we wouldn &apos;t be together .
i guess what l &apos; m trying to say is that ...
... i &apos; m very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .
that &apos;s so sweet !
thank you .
here &apos;s to a lousy christmas !
and a crappy new year !
hear , hear !
hear , hear !
