Eddie Lamb gave this to Ezra.
It's a drawing of my mother.
He left it anonymously.
Eddie wants Ezra to know
that there's something to look into at Radley.
Thief.
Thief.
The reason Zack kept calling last night,
he wanted to know your reaction.
He proposed?
Cheers.
Hanna, right?
It's Sydney, Emily's friend.
You on your way out?
No, I just had dinner over at Em's.
Do you want to sit for a minute?
I guess I probably could sober up a little bit.
You don't have to worry about Shana, she's dead.
I killed her.
What did I miss?
Did you just get the text that came in? It's from "A."
"New York, New York, it's hell of a town.
Ali's keeping secrets.
Maybe that's because of Hanna's big mouth."
*What child is this,*
*Who laid to rest on Mary's lap, is sleeping*
*Whom angels greet with anthem sweet*
*While shepherds watch are keeping*
*This, this is...*
So you hadn't spoken to Shana
since before the abduction?
I hadn't spoken to anyone during--
No, I get it.
Not until you broke free.
I'm just trying to understand why Shana,
who thought you were deceased,
chose to move up to this area and live with her aunt.
I can't answer that.
Well, neither can Shana,
who really is deceased.
So you will have to bear with me
while I wrap my brain around the coincidence.
Did you ever try to contact Shana?
I thought this was going to be about my mother.
Am I the only one who thinks that this freak
went after her because I got away from him?
The police have many theories.
Why would Tanner do this in here?
To make a point. We're next.
Maybe the cops saw Ali sneaking out of her house last night, too.
You didn't tell Ali about Spencer's tapes, did you?
Of course not.
Some of us know how to keep our mouths shut.
Hey, what was that about?
Shana. It was all about Shana.
Does Tanner know we weren't in Philly that night?
I can't tell.
But she clearly doesn't believe my story.
She's trying to trip me up.
Okay, well, I got to go call Ezra.
No, Aria, wait.
For what?
So she can go ambush him
while he's having a medical check-up in New York?
He needs to know what was broadcast in the brew.
What's wrong?
When did this happen?
Did you have your bag with you all morning?
Yeah.
What're you looking at?
I don't get it.
Somebody's circled all the "A's."
What? Is there something else?
"Glad to hear you singing.
Last time you were all choked up."
It's not an outrageous theory.
Mona may have recruited half the school to torture Alison.
It's not just Alison.
We're all hearing from "A" Again.
We still have no idea who was in the Brew
with Hanna and Sydney.
Maybe Sydney can tell us.
Are you collecting that for recycling?
Hanna,
what is going on with you?
What are you talking about?
Yesterday your blouse was on inside out
and today your locker smells like Oktoberfest.
What are you, the hall monitor?
No, we're your friends.
And we're a little bit concerned.
You know what, this can isn't even mine.
Caleb probably put it in my bag.
Don't. I already have one friend throwing me shade.
Have you apologized to her?
Aria doesn't want to hear it.
I left her a message.
Yeah, we heard it.
And it sounded like you were underwater
and Caleb was laughing in the background.
He was watching a guy eat his own beard on YouTube.
Classy. You may need to say it again.
Yeah, and apologize to Alison.
Hanna, you almost outed her in front of my mom.
Okay, we were there to support her story,
not throw peanuts at the stage.
Let's just finish this at lunch.
I have other plans.
Ali got grilled by Tanner.
"A" must have tipped her off about New York.
Has Eddie called yet?
We need to figure out what's up with those drawings.
I've got to get them back to Big Rhonda
before she notices they're missing.
Ezra, just call me as soon as you can, okay?
Hey, what are you-- what are you doing here?
I was just dropping off some invitations.
What are you doing outside?
I just had to leave a message for Dad.
I think I left a book in his car.
You were out the door so fast this morning.
I thought maybe we could have breakfast together.
Yeah, I just figured
you guys were a little jet-lagged.
So look, I know we've asked you to say
a little something Saturday night.
Oh, Mom, no.
I don't have to. It's-- it's your engagement party.
No, honey, no, I want you to. It's just--
I was wondering if I could introduce you
as my maid of honor.
Oh, my God, of course!
Yes, of course.
I'm so glad you said that.
So I booked us an appointment today
this afternoon at the bridal shop. So--
Wait. Today?
No-- no, I can't today. I'm at Radley.
Well, can another volunteer cover your shift?
Cause it's just a little tricky to get these appointments,
'cause they book a suite and they do a tea service--
Sounds like fun, Mom,
but I'm gonna run ahead to class.
Can we figure this out later?
Sure.
Sydney.
Hey, were you watching practice?
No, I got hung up in Language Lab.
Damn. I beat my freestyle record, thanks to you.
Actually, I wanted to thank you,
helping Hanna sober up last night.
I mean, I heard she was totally out of it.
She didn't seem that bad.
Really?
She's like Amish when it comes to booze.
Two sips and she's blotto.
Making stuff up, telling people
her grandfather invented the paper clip.
Did he?
Hanna's? No.
But she called me from home
and started rambling about us going back to New York.
I mean, we've never even been to New York together.
Did she invite you, too?
I don't think she ever mentioned New York.
Are you seriously not gonna tell me
the real reason you came in here?
Did they not make the offer?
What offer?
Assistant Coach. The team took a vote.
Oh, my God.
Either you're an amazing liar
or I am a total idiot.
Please say you're thrilled.
Um... I don't know.
I mean, I have so much stuff going on...
Oh. Okay.
Sorry.
I thought you'd want this, my bad.
Hello?
Caleb?
Oh, hey, baby.
I thought we were meeting for lunch.
What time is it?
Uh, half past I'm hungry.
Uh, sorry, I must have overslept.
Let me just throw some clothes on.
No, no worries. I'll just see you later.
Hydrate.
Thanks.
Look, I'm really sorry about the other night
at Emily's dinner.
That was so not cool.
Um, we're all stressed.
But if there's something else
and you're really upset with me...
No, we're good.
So my dad's going to Westport for a few days
and he wants me to go with him.
Is "A" gonna let that happen?
Never.
But I obviously can't stay home alone, so.
Can I crash at your house?
Um, I -- I'd have to talk to my mom.
She has a lot going on right now.
But I'll talk to her.
It just gets more twisted.
If Bethany was the one who pushed your mom off the roof
and Mrs. DiLaurentis covered for it,
then I don't understand why she would
draw these pictures of Mrs. DiLaurentis getting
skewered by a demon.
And why would she turn on her?
And did "A" play any part in it?
Because right now the only common denominator
between Bethany and Mrs. D is "A."
I'm sorry.
I know that you wanted to put Radley behind you.
I can't put this behind me until it's over.
And it's not.
But it might be soon.
Once I'm asking questions from the inside.
From the inside of what?
Did both your parents move out?
No, my mom's just not sitting down for meals.
She's barely even eating.
Your parents are gonna work through this, Spencer.
They've got a lot of history together.
That's what's splitting them up.
What did you mean by the "inside"?
The police department.
I enrolled at the Harrisburg Police Academy.
No, you didn't.
You wouldn't do that.
Why would you do that without telling me?
Probably because I anticipated this warm
and encouraging response.
Toby, you can't just become a policeman.
Why not? I thought the uniform was a turn-on.
No, it's not. Is this why you cut your hair?
Well, you know, since the uniform didn't work.
People do not just up and join a police academy.
They do, when they're tired of watching people
they love feel unprotected.
Oh, my God.
What -- look, the cops in this town
are either bungling or corrupt.
Wouldn't it be refreshing to have someone inside
that building who actually cares?
Somebody who'll have access to all those police records?
And somebody who doesn't think my house blew up
because of a gas leak?
So now who's gonna cook this dinner
I was invited over for?
You or me?
Can I help you?
Um, I'm -- I'm looking for Eddie Lamb.
He works here.
I was just helping out with art therapy.
I know why you're here. But Eddie's not.
Yesterday was his last day.
He didn't mention that.
Did he get another job?
I have no idea.
Did he leave a forwarding number?
Anyway to contact him?
Are you here to finger-paint or speed-date the orderlies?
I suggest you stick to the day room.
You looked for something?
I--
I couldn't find you
and I just wanted to take another peek at your sketchbook
and then just put it right back.
One of the nurses...
they said that you stashed it under your bed.
I'm sorry, Rhonda. Really.
I -- I never meant to invade your space.
But I'm gonna go back to the day room now.
They're probably looking for me.
I can forget I saw you here.
Okay.
But it might cost you something.
Like what?
There were so many days I thought I wouldn't make it.
But then I thought of my family
and that's what got me through it.
Picturing my house, my family.
Hey, sweetie.
Oh. Hey, Han.
Alison is going to stay with us for a few days
until her dad gets back.
Ali, why don't you go upstairs and try to get some rest, okay?
Hanna and I can finish making dinner.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
You should take a nice hot bath.
Here, you can use these.
It'll help you relax.
Thank you, Mrs. Marin.
You're welcome.
Hanna, can you wash your hands and help?
We're having stir fry.
That was so upsetting.
That girl has no support system at all.
You know I used to think Ali was too tough for her own good.
But, thank God.
Thank God she is.
Otherwise I don't think she'd have survived.
After dinner, could you please
make up the day bed with clean sheets?
I'm actually not gonna stay for dinner.
I promised Caleb that I'd help him study
for his exit exams.
Okay, well, could you at least show Alison
where the guest towels are?
Fine.
And by the way, I've asked to use those bath salts,
like a million times.
Do you want a cup with that?
Maybe some crushed ice.
Why you so into that sketchbook?
Was she a friend of yours?
Bethany?
No, I-- I never met her.
But her body was buried in my friend's backyard.
So I think everyone's just a little curious about
who she was, why she ran away.
Everybody thinks about running away from here.
A lot of folks had it a whole lot worse than she did.
How do you mean?
I never had nobody signing me out,
taking me to the circus.
Wait. Who signed Bethany out?
That rich lady with the big beige purse.
She gave Bethany a whole lot more than a bag of chips.
Wait. What rich lady?
Was her name Mrs. DiLaurentis?
Something like that.
What kind of gifts was she giving her?
Did she ever give her any clothes?
A yellow top, maybe? It was layered and--
I don't remember anything about a top.
But I sure as hell remember Custard.
She gave her a pie?
A horse.
She took her out to those stables by Lewisburg
and let Bethany adopt her own damn pony.
Do you know why Mrs. DiLaurentis
would have been giving her all these gifts?
Rhonda, that rich lady was murdered recently.
And her body was found in the backyard next door
to where Bethany's was buried.
And there's a really good chance
that the same exact person did this to both of them.
Now do you have any idea at all who this person might be?
What's going on in here?
Where did you get that?
Is this your idea of "Occupational therapy"?
Giving a diabetic soda pop?
Get out of here. Now.
I can't even stand to look at her
and now she's in my pajamas, drooling on my pillow.
Please tell me you brought food in that bag.
I thought I was supplying beverages.
Hey, do you want to go on a trip together?
You mean, further than your cabin?
Yeah, someplace far.
You're not the only one who needs to change it up.
How do you feel about, um, Japan?
Mm-mm. I can't.
The only sushi I do is California Rolls.
Myanmar?
Okay, if I can't spell it or pronounce it,
I can't go there.
Hey, did you bring anything to cut this with?
I was just gonna wait till we got back to my place.
Do you want to stop and get sodas?
I need a sandwich. I'm starving.
You know, I'll be right back. Do you want anything?
Hanna. Can I help you?
Or are you just cooling off your face?
I want a tuna melt.
Sorry, I closed it up early tonight
to get ready for tomorrow.
Aria's mom just left.
Right.
Do you want it to-go?
Sydney?
What's going on?
Your mom said I could interrupt.
This was delivered to my house and...
well, I'm not really sure what to do with it now.
You ordered this for me?
Guess I should have waited before I pulled the trigger.
You won't take no for an answer, will you?
Maybe 'cause our training sessions aren't happening anymore.
I just wanted to know you'd still be in the bleachers.
It kind of sucks when you're the new kid on the team
and no one's cheering you on.
My boyfriend used to, but now he's in college.
What about your parents?
My mom's not into it.
And my dad's always traveling.
He's opening these frozen yogurt shops.
They're all over the place.
You probably saw one when you were in New York.
They're called--
Wait.
When was I in New York?
Didn't you say you and your friends were...
No, that was Hanna and you said that
she never mentioned--
My brain is mush, too much time underwater.
Hey, you want mustard?
Yes, please.
Looks really nice in here.
Glad you approve.
"Quincinera."
"Quin-ci-nera."
You know what I'm talking about.
I do.
Just a heads up. I can smell you from here.
What's that? Rum?
Whiskey.
Whiskey? Jeez.
The rough stuff.
Bad girl, huh?
Always had a thing for the bad girls.
You know, this is the part where I'm supposed
to lecture you about drinking,
but I'm willing to keep this between us.
I can keep a secret. Can you?
Did Aria make the flowers?
Yeah. They're great, right?
All yours.
Thank you.
Oh, no, no, please.
It's on me.
Thanks.
I'll never get back in that room.
Did they fire you?
No, I didn't kill her.
I just gave her a frigging root beer.
How was I supposed to know she needed sugar-free?
What's the name of the stables?
I don't know, but we can figure that out.
How many stables are near Lewisburg?
Aria, it's called "Horse Country" for a reason.
I got to go.
I completely forgot.
Where were you?
I went through a lot of trouble to change that appointment time
and then you just blew it off.
What is wrong with you?
I'm sorry.
I-- I just have a lot on my mind.
Really?
Or is this some form of passive resistance?
What? I don't even know--
Because if something has changed since I first told you,
if you don't want me to get married again,
I need you to be open about it, instead of acting out.
No, that's not it at all.
Mom, I'm really happy for you. I just--
I don't know, honestly, I just forgot.
Okay, I will try and change the time.
But if you miss it--
I won't.
I promise.
I think you should take me home.
It's getting late and I don't want my mom to worry.
Hanna, I can't drive right now.
I can call you a cab or something.
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's just, my skirt.
It's too short.
No. It's not.
It's perfect.
Can you call them in like a half an hour?
I have to go.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm just drunk and I'm tired.
And I want to go to sleep.
Sure. I'll find out.
She wanted to know why Hanna was absent.
What'd you say?
I said, I don't know. It's the truth.
Maybe she's just trying to avoid Aria.
Avoiding is not returning a call.
Chasing down your morning muffin with malt liquor,
that's something else.
If she won't listen to us,
someone needs to talk to Caleb.
Aria found out the name of the stables.
Well, let's go after school.
What exactly are we looking for?
We always thought that Mrs. D
was protecting whoever hit Ali out of love.
What if it was out of fear?
What if this person had something on her?
So now we're thinking that Bethany hit Ali?
Where have you been?
I fell asleep in Caleb's car.
Where is everybody?
Did class start yet?
No, it's over.
What's in your hair?
It's a Krispie Treat. Can you get it out please?
Hanna,
why are you napping at 10 A.M.?
Because I couldn't sleep, okay?
I have a new roommate named Alison.
And there's other stuff, too.
Ow! Emily don't pull so hard.
Well, it's glued to your scalp.
What other stuff?
Hanna, what other stuff?
If "A" is targeting you--
It's not "A."
Okay. I had a really weird moment with your boss last night.
My boss?
Zack?
Yeah.
I went to the Brew to get a sandwich
and he just got a little bit too friendly. Okay?
What are you talking about?
He put his hand on my back, Emily,
and it was there for way too long.
Are you sure that you're not reading into this?
No.
I mean, were you buzzed?
You know what, forget I said anything.
Hanna, wait.
No! The only reason I told you
was because part of me wants to say something to Aria.
But if you two don't believe me--
That's not what we said.
It's just that if you misinterpreted this at all,
you don't want to be putting it out there
two days before this guy's engagement party.
And once it's said, you can't take it back.
Yeah, you're right.
See you guys later.
Hey, Hanna.
No, I have to go to the bathroom.
Hanna, are you in there?
The school just called me.
Alison?
Is everything okay? Where's Hanna?
Caleb picked her up.
Why aren't you at school?
What happened?
I heard someone last night...
outside the window, trying to get in.
I couldn't go to sleep.
I just kept hearing things.
And when I got up to go to school this morning...
I couldn't move.
Alison...
Did you sleep in there last night?
Okay, I'll call the school.
You try to get some rest, okay?
I'm gonna take the day off.
Are you Declan?
Hi. The lady inside said you were the one
to talk to for lessons.
I don't work with beginners.
Well, I'm not.
I've had 8 years of English.
I teach Western.
We... we just heard that this place was really great.
Our neighbor used to ride up here.
Jessica DiLaurentis?
She might not have been up here for a while.
But there was this horse, Custard?
You here on some kind of dare?
What?
You look like the only horse
you've ever been around was stuffed and in your crib.
If you're that spooked around Zarro--
She's not spooked.
Just shy.
Okay.
Come on, Zarro. Come on.
What are you? Mute?
So Hanna's having dinner with Caleb again.
Not really sure what's going on with her.
But I thought the two of us could go out
and grab a bite to eat.
I'm okay staying here.
Honey, you've been inside all day.
I think we need to go out.
Okay.
Declan?
Sorry, we're still here. Just curious.
Do you ever let people adopt your horses?
We've done it a few times.
Special cases.
That lady you're talking about,
is she the one who came up here with that strange girl?
The one who wanted to ride in her slippers?
Bethany?
I don't remember names.
But after the bucket incident,
I don't think they ever came back.
What--
what happened with the bucket?
The lady wanted the girl to call her Aunt Jessie.
Girl has a meltdown, throws a bucket at her.
I knew they weren't related.
There was something else going on.
Was it always just the two of them
or was there ever a third person?
Maybe another blonde girl
who called Mrs. DiLaurentis "Mom"?
A lot of people come through here.
I don't take attendance.
You guys might want to head out
before that storm kicks in.
The roads up here, they turn into soup.
Thanks.
Why would you ask if Alison had come up here?
She told us she never met Bethany.
Yeah, she told us a lot of things.
Where are you going with this?
I don't know.
I just thought it would be worth it to float the question.
It's gonna start pouring. Let's go.
No, I just need to take a look around here first.
Spencer, where are you going?
Hey. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
Saw you out here, thought we could talk.
I was actually just about to leave.
What's your rush? Finish your meal.
I just wasn't sure what your takeaway was of yesterday.
Yeah, sorry I was sort of off.
Right.
I wasn't sure if you were feeling
the same vibe as me, but...
I kind of think you are.
Keep me up.
There's two of us.
Yes, and can we just have a quieter table,
maybe in the corner or something?
All right. Thank you. Bye.
Hanna?
Is that you, honey?
Hanna?
Alison?
I'll be down in a minute.
You know, actually I'm not that hungry.
Give me your phone.
911. What is your emergency?
Anything distinctive about it? The shadow?
Mrs. Marin?
It was a man.
A man's shadow.
Feel certain that's what it was, Alison?
Yes.
Why do you feel certain it was a man's shadow?
Because it was big.
Loud.
Loud?
His weight made the floorboards creak.
I thought you weren't aware of the intruder
until you came downstairs.
By that time he would have been in the kitchen.
Are there floorboards in the kitchen or is it tile?
Floorboards. Why are you questioning her like this?
This is just standard police procedure.
Really? To treat the victim like a criminal?
I'm just gathering as much detailed information as I can.
Hasn't this girl been through enough?
There's a predator out there and you have done nothing,
nothing to make anyone feel any safer!
Mrs. Marin...
I'm not talking to you as a concerned citizen.
I'm a mother,
whose daughter is also affected by this situation.
You need to catch this psycho before--
before he strikes again.
Do you need a towel?
No, I'm fine.
Look, I know that me and you
aren't on the best terms right now,
but I had to come over and I don't know
how else to say this, so I guess I'll just say it but--
Zack hit on me.
What?
At first I thought that he was joking,
but then he got into my car and...
Wait.
What-- what are you saying?
He wanted to hook up with me.
You kissed him?
No.
No, I didn't.
But he was the one who...
This is so messed up.
Aria, I know. That's why I wanted to tell you.
No. You.
You are the problem, Hanna.
You're always the problem.
What?
The rest of us are getting ulcers
trying not to say the wrong thing,
and you're getting hammered in front of Emily's mom
and blabbing to a stranger.
I told you I was sorry.
No, you didn't tell me that. "A" did.
You couldn't even remember what you said.
We were just shouting out guesses
trying to jog your memory.
It's like playing charades with drunky.
Sounds like murder.
That's not true.
What'd you do, Hanna?
Did you invite him into your car?
Why would I do that?
Were you trashed?
No.
If you want to spiral out of control
and self-destruct, by all means go right ahead.
But I sure as hell am not going to let you
take my mom down, too.
They're not gonna list every visitor that's ever come.
You don't know that.
I'm looking for Alison's handwriting.
Did you find something?
Why was this hanging here?
What do you mean?
What's it doing?
This is my sister's.
Look at the initials.
M.H. Oh, my God. How did you--
I recognized the riding crest.
It's where we used to take lessons.
What is it doing here?
Why is he so freaked out?
It's the thunder.
Let's go.
No, not yet.
Spencer, for God's sake,
just take the helmet with you, okay?
I want to check the list again.
Maybe Melissa signed in with a different name.
Yeah, Maleficent, okay?
I'm out of here.
Spencer, it's locked?
What?
How do we get out of here?
Oh, my God.
Help!
Somebody help!
Quick, grab the other end of this.
What? We climb to the roof?
No, just push it up against the gate. Hurry.
Oh, damn it!
Come on!
Toby.
I got your message.
Are you okay?
What happened to your eye?
Something's just stuck in it
and I'm trying to get it out.
What's that smell?
What smell?
It smells like...
Manure?
Yeah, what is that?
It's manure.
Emily and I went over to the stables
where Mrs. DiLaurentis used to take Bethany.
Did you find something?
Bethany apparently didn't like to be bribed.
And my sister's riding helmet was there.
Wait, what?
Melissa's been up there, too?
Possibly, unless "A" knew that we were going out there
and then just planted it.
What happened to your eye, Spence?
We got locked in this stall
and the horse next to us just went psychotic
and we got really close to being kicked to death.
So did "A" take credit for this yet?
Toby.
I'm just-- I'm so tired of feeling like this.
Feeling like what?
Powerless.
That's what I wanted to call and tell you.
What, that you're lucky you didn't get trampled?
No. To tell you that I'm sorry.
What are you talking about?
If you becoming a cop is going to put an end to this,
then I say, go.
Study hard,
graduate early.
Because coming back to this house
with my parents split up and...
Melissa being a part of this, it's just--
it's getting so much worse.
Why can't I get this?
Sweetheart, there's a limited amount of tissue paper around here.
Are you shaming me?
You have no shame.
No shame--
Oh, man, look at yours.
Master at work.
Is your son great at this, too?
No, which is why he's hiding upstairs.
Okay, I'm gonna take a break.
Movie time?
No, I-- I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
Really? But you said this morning you wanted
to watch that one.
That's why we got it.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
You know what?
Let's watch it. I'll rally.
I'm not leaving another voicemail.
Who are you trying to call?
Aria. She won't call me back.
Have you heard from Aria?
No, I just got off the phone with Hanna though.
What's with the cop car in your driveway?
He brought me here so I could get my dad's numbers in Westport.
And I told him I need to pack up a few more things.
How's Hanna's mom?
She's a basket case.
I mean, is this how it's going to be from now on?
Our parents are going to be physically attacked, too?
This is not the same "A" who got their jollies
breaking into our lockers and leaving nasty notes.
This "A" is...
Noel Kahn.
What did you say?
I asked Noel to break into Hanna's house tonight.
That's who was in the kitchen. It was Noel.
I needed someone who mattered.
Someone like Hanna's mom to stop questioning
what happened to me.
Why would you do that?
Well, it worked, didn't it?
