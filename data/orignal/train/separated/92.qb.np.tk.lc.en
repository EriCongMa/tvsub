it was a party .
a ... senior class party .
at todd &apos;s place .
and you went with some friends ?
yes .
gina and becky .
and you said this was at todd &apos;s house .
you mean the defendant , todd bratcher ?
yes .
now before we go further ,
rainey , there might be a question
as to why this is taking place in a civil court
and not a criminal court .
a rape would seem to be a criminal matter ...
objection , your honor .
counselor is testifying .
sustained .
thank you .
so , rainey ,
why are you suing your rapist ?
your accused rapist ?
he &apos;s not in jail .
he raped me and got a plea bargain with the prosecution ,
so he &apos;s going to princeton ,
not prison .
i don &apos;t think he should get off scot @-@ free .
so the money , the amount you &apos;re suing him for ?
it &apos;s going to rape victim advocates .
i ... just want it to cost him something .
i don &apos;t want any ...
excuse me .
i need to interrupt for a minute here . sheriff ,
please take the jury into the holding room .
uh , sorry , your honor , i &apos;m not sure ...
mr. gardner , please wait for the jury to be removed .
i just received a copy of this tweet a minute ago ,
&quot; i don &apos;t care if they put me in jail .
todd bratcher raped me . &quot;
at the beginning of this trial ,
i insisted on one thing :
not trying this case in the press .
i put a gag order in place for exactly that reason .
and now ... there &apos;s this .
so i must ask you , ms. selwin ...
your honor , please let me speak to my client ...
don &apos;t you want to hear
my question first ?
i do . i &apos;m sorry .
did you write this tweet ?
your honor , i must insist
on my client &apos;s fifth amendment right
against self @-@ incrimination .
no . i ...
it would be better if you insist on your right
or that your sister posted this for you .
mr. gardner , i did ...
he &apos;ll hold you in contempt .
if he holds you in contempt ...
he wins .
excuse me . i asked a very simple question .
your honor , rainey insists on her fifth amendment right .
todd bratcher raped me , so i wrote that .
then i must hold you in contempt .
sheriff , please take the witness into custody .
your honor , my client is 18 years old .
young people don &apos;t see tweeting as publicizing .
she knew exactly what she was doing .
this court is adjourned .
hey , alicia . where are you ?
lunch with dylan stack .
oh , mr. bitcoin . yeah , what &apos;s he want ?
i don &apos;t know . some class action .
rainey selwin has been held in contempt .
i need your help with judge parks .
you ... what @-@ what happened ?
the gag order , she broke it .
oh , no . that &apos;s awful .
i know . can you be here at 2 : 00 ?
yes , sure . i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll head right over after this .
i &apos;m so sorry .
okay . thanks .
something go wrong ?
no , just a client who &apos;s idealistic .
is that a bad thing ?
no , it just complicates things .
how does it complicate things ?
reality isn &apos;t idealistic ,
and when the two of them run into each other ,
only one gets hurt .
maybe it &apos;ll be reality this time .
uh , my guess is not .
so tell me about this class action .
no , no , that &apos;s not a segue .
&quot; speaking of idealism ... &quot;
now , there &apos;s a segue .
do you know who aaron swartz is ?
the computer activist who died .
the computer activist who committed suicide
after an unrelenting campaign from federal prosecutors
to imprison him .
of course .
in his memory , i am attempting
to organize a class action
against prosecutorial overcharging .
and you want us to join this class action ?
yes .
i &apos;ll run it by my partners ,
but they &apos;re not always into causes for causes &apos; sake .
they tend to want to see the ...
would you stop doing that ?
what ?
slapping your money around .
where do you get it , anyway ?
work .
okay , put it away .
don &apos;t you worry
that you &apos;re gonna get held up , because when ...
when i ...
when you ...
i will run it by my partners .
with your recommendation ?
with my recommendation .
um , do you mind ? i &apos;ll be right back .
please .
your honor , our client has never
been in trouble with the law before .
she has no criminal record .
that &apos;s beside the point .
she found out this morning that
her rapist was admitted to princeton ,
and she was angry .
it has not been proved that he is a rapist ,
and it isn &apos;t helping your cause
that you keep insisting on facts not in evidence .
we only want to relate her passion
and why this tweeting won &apos;t happen again .
mrs. florrick , mr. gardner ,
if the defendant had written a tweet
insisting that rainey was lying ,
i would be equally angry , and he &apos;d be behind bars .
this gag order is , and was , content neutral .
but ...
get your client to apologize
and promise not to tweet again , and i &apos;ll release her .
and the , uh , trial , your honor ?
this will not impact the trial . either way , we &apos;re going forward .
i know , but there is nothing wrong
with apologizing to the court .
there is . i &apos;m sorry , but there is .
let &apos;s say that this goes against me .
we have a good case .
but the prosecutors had a good case ,
and todd bratcher is free .
so let &apos;s say this goes against me .
then what &apos;s out there is not
&quot; todd bratcher is a rapist . &quot;
what &apos;s out there is
&quot; i &apos;m sorry for calling todd bratcher a rapist . &quot;
the gag order will only last as long as the trial .
afterwards , you can say anything you want .
but it will still be out there that i apologized
for calling todd bratcher a rapist .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m scared to be in here .
but i @-@ i can &apos;t live with myself apologizing
for saying something that is true .
are you all right ?
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d have that ...
determination .
so we have to win this .
let me say first
that the florrick campaign is still very enthusiastic
about you filling the open seat for supreme court justice ,
and with florrick three points ahead in the polls ,
we thought it best to keep moving forward .
good . i &apos;m not sure about &quot; still . &quot;
mr. florrick has asked me merely to look into
some of the issues in your background .
nothing should be read into the questions .
okay ?
okay .
kurt mcveigh ?
could you be more specific , please ?
you &apos;ve worked with him ?
and he &apos;s a ballistics expert
and your occasional lover ?
is that not the correct word ?
it &apos;s the correct word , but not the most subtle .
my apologies .
vetting is an unsubtle art .
mr. mcveigh holds secessionist views ?
his views are not secessionist .
he has said he would not stand
in the way of those who would secede .
i &apos;ve heard my liberal friends express the same sentiment
about , um , texas seceding .
um , is there a problem with mr. mcveigh &apos;s views ?
not at the moment .
the campaign has red flags due to his name , mcveigh .
it can look bad .
even if it &apos;s not bad ?
it &apos;s just , sometimes superficial things ,
like names , can hurt a candidacy .
for example , having the middle name hussein ?
it would be better if we could argue
that mr. mcveigh is a casual friend .
is that a better word ?
it is a better word ,
but it can &apos;t be argued that .
why can &apos;t it be argued that ?
we &apos;re getting married .
i didn &apos;t catch that in my vetting .
oh , neither did i.
yes , it , um , it just happened .
well , that might cause problems .
i understand .
okay .
um , let me take this back ,
and ...
congratulations .
thanks for meeting me .
are you up for a stroll ?
this is very cloak @-@ and @-@ dagger .
stroll it is .
when we met at my apartment , we ...
we talked about leaving together .
starting our own firm .
are you still thinking of doing that ?
am i still thinking of leaving together ? no .
are you thinking of leaving at all ?
starting your own firm ?
no .
that would cause me to get fired ,
so of course not .
cary ,
i saw you at clovis seafood .
meeting with the fourth years .
so ?
i just want to know
if you guys are organizing something .
we &apos;re meeting .
we like each other .
i didn &apos;t know that was wrong .
it &apos;s not wrong , i &apos;m just ...
alicia .
we &apos;re not plotting anything , okay ?
was i angry when i lost my partnership ?
yeah . were the other fourth years ?
of course they were , but do we trust
you partners will eventually make good on your commitments ?
yes , we do .
okay ?
okay .
do you need anything else or can i get back to work now ?
will we move to springfield ?
huh ?
if dad wins , do we have to move to springfield ?
eli told me that there &apos;s a lot of governors
who work out of chicago , so ...
i don &apos;t think ...
想要看些东西吗
you don &apos;t think ?
hi , i &apos;m rainey .
i &apos;m on the gymnastics team .
oh , i &apos;m so , so sorry .
does that ... does that hurt ?
what is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
where &apos;s it from ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m sorry .
i broke it .
oh , rainey .
oh , oh , rainey .
hello ! i &apos;m home .
what &apos;s wrong ?
oh , it &apos;s so good .
let &apos;s see if this fits .
fit ? oh , it &apos;ll get lost up there .
do it ! oh !
oh , rainey !
let &apos;s see if this fits .
fit ? oh , it &apos;ll get lost up there .
you found this online ?
where were you looking ?
no . no , mom . it just came to me .
it popped up on my screen .
you don &apos;t know who sent this ?
no . did someone at school--
did someone know these kids ?
no , mom . they &apos;re not even from our district .
i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t get it .
did you tell any of your friends i was working on this case ?
mom , no . it was sent to me anonymously .
they knew enough to route it through something
so i couldn &apos;t trace it .
wait , you &apos;re working on this case ?
yes .
are you winning ?
no .
so this is good .
let &apos;s see if this fits .
fit ? oh , it &apos;ll get lost up there .
no , they can &apos;t , your honor .
it has nothing to do with the crime .
your honor , we have an affidavit from jesse martin ,
one of the boys in the video , authenticating ...
it doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s prejudicial .
they never mention a rape .
they mention and joke about a hairbrush
being inserted into rainey &apos;s vagina .
no , a sex doll &apos;s .
uh , mr. gardner , where did you get this ?
it was sent to my house anonymously .
anonymously ?
it was hacked
from my client &apos;s cell phone .
oh , come on .
he deleted this file ,
which is his right !
he was embarrassed ,
as you or i would be , by this awful joke .
that &apos;s why he deleted it .
and that is why it can not be presented in court .
it was obtained through illegal means .
is that true , ma &apos;am ?
i have no idea .
then i have no alternative but to exclude this .
your honor , we have authenticated ...
it doesn &apos;t matter .
i cannot admit illegally @-@ obtained evidence .
what &apos;s wrong now ?
what else ? the fourth years .
i was looking through their billables .
they &apos;re taking their vacation days .
they are ?
all of them ?
yes . all five .
it &apos;s more scare tactics .
they want us to think they &apos;re leaving .
well , i &apos;m not offering more partnerships .
i say we split them up by firing one of their asses .
which one ? we need all of them .
replace cary .
he was the last one hired .
and as far as i &apos;m concerned , he was the ringleader .
i was the ringleader .
so do you think these are more scare tactics ,
or are they really leaving ?
i think it &apos;s nothing , a coincidence .
associates don &apos;t take vacation days .
it &apos;s been an exhausting bankruptcy .
everybody needs their vacation days to unwind .
so they &apos;re over it ? they &apos;re not angry at us anymore ?
i talked to cary yesterday , and he told me that they &apos;re trusting
the partners will live up to their commitments .
okay , and i think we &apos;ve all guardedly
approved of joining this class action
against prosecutorial overcharging .
robyn ?
do you have a second ?
yeah .
oh , oh , hey , sorry about my clothes .
i just came from ... i was ...
actually , i didn &apos;t come from anywhere . i like this .
okay . um , i need to ask you to do something ... for me .
oh , is it about the review ?
the ... ? no .
oh , i @-@ i &apos;m being reviewed this week .
just want to make sure i &apos;m okay .
you &apos;re okay .
yeah ? good . oh , i like working here .
i &apos;m glad . uh , i want you to look into something ,
but come back only to me , not the partners .
the sad thing is ,
i like rainey .
i &apos;ve always liked rainey .
and so ,
you have no idea why she accused you of this ?
no .
she got pretty drunk at this party . we all did .
spring break , you know .
and all i can imagine is ,
she got unhappy with her decision to hook up with me .
yeah , that &apos;s what it must have been .
mr. gardner . do i even have to ?
no , your honor .
and , uh , this , um , hooking up--
it was consensual ?
absolutely .
did you know rainey before this party ?
we dated last year .
so rainey was your ex @-@ girlfriend ?
not exactly .
dylan , what a surprise .
i wanted to see what idealism looks like .
oh , really ? that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ?
yes .
okay , good .
are you the friend ?
am i the ... friend ?
are you the friend who texted something to my son ?
no . i @-@ i don &apos;t ...
know your son . why ?
someone texted something to him .
something that could help me .
i &apos;m sorry . it wasn &apos;t me .
he &apos;s a bastard .
yes .
but does the jury know that ?
i don &apos;t know .
mr. gardner .
good luck .
you did not take advantage
of rainey &apos;s intoxicated state
by having sex with her while she was unconscious ?
correct .
and you did not
insert a hairbrush into her vagina ?
of course not .
and you never made
fun of these claims in her deposition ?
no , never .
objection , your honor !
the witness has opened himself up ...
no , your honor .
yes , he has , your honor .
everybody , up here .
your honor , the defendant has clearly made a claim
that we are now at liberty to impeach .
this is prosecution by stunt .
we must be allowed to use the authenticated videotape .
i already ruled on that .
yes , but not as a means to impeach .
mr. bratcher said he never made fun
of rainey &apos;s deposition .
the only way he could have known about the hairbrush
is if he read it in the deposition ,
or committed the rape .
either way , we must now be allowed to impeach it .
i agree .
your honor , it is prejudicial ...
but only that section of the tape
pertaining to the impeachment .
now step back .
fit ? it &apos;ll probably get lost up there .
we can &apos;t show more ?
unfortunately , no .
just a few more issues .
so ... we &apos;ve moved past ms. lockhart &apos;s relationship
with kurt mcveigh ?
no .
in fact , we need you to meet with chief justice ryvlan .
to what purpose ?
he brought mr. mcveigh &apos;s views to our attention .
we need for you to comfort him as to your views .
you want me to kiss the ring ?
yes .
with all due deference .
well , good .
i can do that .
one other thing .
you represent dylan stack ?
well , we at one time represented dylan stack .
but you no longer do ?
no .
that &apos;s odd ,
&apos;cause i saw him in your waiting room .
well ... is that a problem ?
yes .
he advocates the overthrow of government .
well , i think that &apos;s incorrect .
no . it &apos;s correct .
and should be addressed .
hey , uh , i can &apos;t talk any louder .
there are people here . but i found out something .
that was fast .
yes , i know . um ...
i looked into recent acquisitions
by the fourth years , and cary agos purchased some .
what ?
um , it was malpractice insurance .
they &apos;re gonna need that if they go out on their own .
it was $ 12 million worth , $ 800,000 deductible .
pretty serious .
are all the fourth years involved ?
uh , i have to go .
okay . thanks . bye .
who was that ?
oh , um ...
that &apos;s ... that was my brother .
you &apos;re a terrible liar , robyn .
i &apos;m pretty good at it .
do you mind putting in a good word for me at the review ?
i &apos;ll think about it .
so was that the brother who you shot ?
uh , who told you that ?
someone at treasury .
said you spent six months in juvenile hall
for accidentally shooting your brother .
uh , no . it was another brother .
big family .
mm . big hippie family ?
from oregon , yeah . why ?
no reason .
have a good night .
mom ? !
hello .
you sent another text .
this time , to my daughter .
no .
&quot; hi . want to see something ?
open the attachment idealism . jpg &quot;
i didn &apos;t send that .
okay .
i &apos;m deleting it . thanks .
alicia , wait . wait .
you don &apos;t write to my kids .
alicia , wait . i didn &apos;t send that ,
but i might know who did .
we talked like this .
idealism versus reality .
and then 48 hours later , by accident ,
some anonymous texter sends this to my daughter ?
come on in . please .
it &apos;s some friends .
i told them about your case , our conversation ...
not because i wanted them to do anything .
as an object lesson of what we &apos;re up against .
the cynicism .
i think they &apos;re trying to help you .
we don &apos;t need help .
you do need help .
i was in court today . you &apos;re losing .
where did they get this ?
my guess is , from hacking his account .
the police checked todd &apos;s accounts .
kids today know how to delete evidence .
that doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s gone .
the police don &apos;t know how to hack for it .
my friends do .
it &apos;s not helping .
would you know how to have found that photo ?
no , but the judge will exclude it .
not necessarily .
tell them if they ever
send another text to one of my kids again ,
i won &apos;t even look at it .
i will immediately delete it . understood ?
i &apos;ll tell them .
well , we want this photo in .
i know .
parks will argue that it was obtained illegally .
what if i subpoena the server ?
what server ?
we think this photo was e @-@ mailed from todd &apos;s cell
to his friend jesse , right ?
right .
but then he deleted it .
so the police never found
the photo on todd &apos;s cell ,
but it would still be on the server .
we don &apos;t need this photo ,
we need the identical photo
still on the server .
good .
how you liking being partner ?
i am .
i better ...
okay . see you .
see you .
mom . sorry .
no , no , i just ...
i wanted to say i forgot your cell phone ,
but i will pick it up tomorrow .
no , that &apos;s okay , will called .
what ?
he ...
he said you left my phone .
yeah , i ...
you all right ?
yes .
were you praying just now ?
is that what you were doing ?
yeah .
what were you praying for ?
or is that unlucky ?
no .
no , it &apos;s not like a birthday wish .
i don &apos;t know .
i want to be respectful .
do you pray for me ?
sure , all the time .
because i don &apos;t believe ?
no , no , just because .
i &apos;m sorry , grace .
why ?
i wish i were a better mom .
you &apos;re a great mom .
no .
i was .
but things are ...
out of control .
is it work ?
do you want me to pray for something there ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
i have to stop thinking about myself .
sometimes it &apos;s good to think about yourself .
yes .
and sometimes it &apos;s not .
why , your honor ?
because we believe the defendant deleted photos from his cell .
this is a fishing expedition .
yes , but an oddly specific one .
why are you subpoenaing these exact times ?
pattern , your honor .
it is the only gap in the defendant &apos;s texting history .
and we believe that is because
mr. bratcher deleted those texts .
the police have already covered this ground .
then i don &apos;t see the harm .
your subpoena &apos;s granted .
if this turns into a broader expedition ,
we &apos;ll reassess .
make sure that it doesn &apos;t .
good job .
thanks . you , too .
are we really okay with the fourth years ?
i think so .
so another walk together ?
people &apos;ll say we &apos;re dating .
what &apos;s going on , alicia ?
you bought malpractice insurance .
who told you ?
no one told me . i found out .
do the partners know ?
i &apos;m a partner .
do the other partners know ?
when are you leaving , cary ?
a month .
who are you taking with you ?
the other fourth years .
no , which clients ?
i ... i can &apos;t tell you that .
do you really think
it &apos;s gonna be better out there on your own ?
yeah .
why ?
i was comparing lockhart / gardner to a dozen other firms .
it &apos;s top @-@ heavy .
half the equity partners
are soaking up profit participation
without doing any real work .
what does , what does howard lyman contribute to lockhart / gardner ?
and i &apos;m serious . what does he contribute ?
i don &apos;t know .
and you know how much he takes in each year ?
$ 4 million . for sucking up oxygen .
look , alicia ,
i know i &apos;m taking a chance here ,
and you , you can get me fired with just one word ,
but you and i are the new will and diane .
alicia , do me a favor ,
think about it .
think about what ?
leaving with us .
when you were in law school ,
did you want to change the world ?
did you promise yourself you would always do right ?
and how many times have we done right in the last four years ?
you know i &apos;m right .
florrick , agos &amp; associates .
alicia ...
let me think about it .
new case ?
do you like it ?
very manly .
i &apos;ve , uh , rethought this dylan stack class action .
i think we should drop it .
why ?
he &apos;s not in keeping with our other clients .
what other clients ?
will ... can we drop the case , please ?
well , it depends .
who am i talking to , diane my partner
or diane the supreme court candidate ?
do we have a problem ?
i didn &apos;t think so .
i &apos;m asking for flexibility on one case .
it &apos;s a case we already decided on .
yes , and we &apos;ve changed our minds before .
because it was in the firm &apos;s interest .
just tell me this is in the firm &apos;s interest .
it &apos;s in the firm &apos;s interest .
there . happy ?
you &apos;re talking to alicia ?
excuse me ?
you said you wouldn &apos;t say a thing .
about what ?
about my leaving .
i thought you weren &apos;t leaving .
kalinda , don &apos;t talk to alicia .
uh , cary , i didn &apos;t say anything .
i trusted you when you told me that you weren &apos;t leaving .
i thought you were telling me the truth .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t say a thing .
i also found bruising on ms. selwin &apos;s
left and right thigh ,
and abrasions on the lower back and buttocks area .
thank you , doctor .
and do you interpret these injuries differently
than the plaintiffs ?
yes . i don &apos;t think they &apos;re indicative of rape
as much as vigorous gymnastics training .
and the plaintiff is a gymnast ?
yes , that is my understanding .
do you interpret these injuries differently
than the plaintiff &apos;s ?
yes , i think ...
you said bring it to you .
leave your kids out of this .
bring what to me ?
i know you like solid things . this one &apos;s on paper .
from your friends ?
your friends , too .
it &apos;s regarding the good doctor in there .
dr. brinks , you stated that you attended
baylor university and studied ... ?
general obstetrics .
right . and you wrote several papers
while there , didn &apos;t you ?
i ... yes .
didn &apos;t you write a paper arguing that women
could not get pregnant when raped ?
i &apos;m sorry ...
objection ! relevance .
your honor , the defense expert &apos;s attitude
toward rape is directly relevant
to his testimony on rape .
seems inarguable . overruled .
i don &apos;t know where you got that .
doctor , you did argue that the female anatomy of ducks
has evolved to the point where
the reproductive tract can resist rape .
but that &apos;s a draft . i never submitted it .
and that the same has happened in adult women ?
i wrote that when i was very young .
i was positing intellectual theories .
theories that women can &apos;t really be raped ?
no !
that female reproduction
uses trauma as a block to pregnancy .
good , as long as we know how you really think .
nothing further .
stand up there . yes , you .
both of you . stand up .
sheriff , lead these men out of here .
take off the mask . now !
get &apos; em out of my courtroom .
who is that ?
anonymous .
hi .
hey .
so here we are .
here we are .
alicia asked you to look into cary leaving .
kalinda ...
what ?
isn &apos;t that what happened ?
a partner comes to you and asks you to do some work ...
alicia ?
let me keep it as a hypothetical .
um , this partner asks you not tell anyone else
what you found out .
you know , lockhart / gardner has a lot of people
wanting a lot of different things .
the problem is ... you don &apos;t make that promise .
okay . lesson learned .
you never shot your brother .
yeah , i did .
no , you didn &apos;t . i checked your background .
why are you checking my background ?
why are you saying you shot your brother ?
is this going to affect my review ?
that depends .
i am from sherwood .
it &apos;s outside portland .
nothing ever happens in sherwood .
okay .
i &apos;ll see you .
mine &apos;s the next one over .
chief justice ,
i &apos;m so sorry .
i saw that the door was open .
um , a real tragedy .
yes , justice ludwig will be missed .
no , let &apos;s , let &apos;s chat here .
here ? are you sure ?
yes . please .
your honor , if i may , i &apos;d , i &apos;d like
t @-@ to get in front of something
that may concern you .
my private life .
your secessionist boyfriend .
he doesn &apos;t hold secessionist views .
i don &apos;t care--
not about him . he &apos;s not a lawyer .
oh , well , i was led to believe ...
yes , you were .
they misunderstood .
i said your &quot; partner , &quot; they heard &quot; fiance . &quot;
my mistake to talk to a nonlawyer .
my partner ?
yes , the one who was disbarred .
suspended .
i see , are we engaging in some extramural sophistry here ?
uh , no .
the review board reconsidered and
suspended him for his good works .
ms. lockhart ...
... you have been striving all your life
to understand the law , to , to mold it
to your will ?
yes .
you &apos;ve had losses , you &apos;ve had wins .
well , i am here to tell you that the law
is a mountain .
you &apos;ve been climbing slowly ...
for decades ...
... and we &apos;ve been watching you climb .
from the top we &apos;ve watched you .
now i can tell you , you &apos;re here .
you &apos;ve arrived .
this is the top .
this room , that desk .
and you can either stay ...
... or slide back down .
i want to stay .
of course you do .
you can &apos;t engage in this sophistry .
your partner is a scoundrel
to be spurned an @-@ and not embraced .
do you understand me ?
i don &apos;t think i do .
well ...
it &apos;s very nice to meet you .
please take the jury into the holding room .
anything i need to know ?
i don &apos;t think so .
counselors , approach .
the plaintiff &apos;s subpoena has been quashed .
excuse me , your honor , why ?
because your photo is online .
your honor , i can &apos;t believe the plaintiff .
they knew this photo existed .
mr. andrews , quiet .
mr. gardner , you requested a subpoena
for a photo you knew existed .
no , your honor , i did not .
yes , counselor ...
so your subpoena is hereby quashed .
but , your honor , we don &apos;t need a subpoena now .
the photo is online .
and illegally obtained ,
so , no , this will not be shown to the jury .
justice for rainey selwin .

justice for rainey selwin .

is it true ?
that &apos;s what i want to know .
is what true ?
diane , stop stonewalling .
brenda saw you down in springfield
at the supreme court .
i was meeting with justice ryvlan .
but is it true ?
are you being considered for ludwig &apos;s seat ?
don &apos;t look at will .
it &apos;s an easy question .
yes , i am being considered .
and for how long ?
how long have you been being considered ?
six weeks .
and didn &apos;t you think that was important to tell us ?
we didn &apos;t want to unduly alarm anyone
if it wasn &apos;t a certainty .
it &apos;s not your choice .
this isn &apos;t your personal fiefdom .
what you do affects us .
and did you know ?
your husband is appointing her .
did you know ?
yes .
diane , you need to be stepping back right now .
how are we supposed to know
whether you &apos;re doing for what &apos;s good for the court
or for us ?
you don &apos;t .
then step the hell back .
we &apos;ll think about it .
oh , yes , your highness , please do .
in the meantime , diane ,
you are taking money out of our pockets
as a profit participant .
hold on , hold on , everybody .
hold on .
sorry , sorry , but you need to see this .
just give us 15 minutes .
it &apos;s the rainey case ,
and you &apos;re gonna be getting a call
from the judge any minute .
citizens of the world ,
we at anonymous have watched with dismay
as each year in the united states
thousands of rapists skirt justice .
this is one such rapist , todd bratcher .
in an effort to aid the hard @-@ working attorneys
attempting to bring him to justice ,
uh @-@ oh .
we urge the judge to stop
rejecting worthy evidence , like this photo .
why , your honor ,
are you leaving this out ?
oh , we are so screwed .
wait . it gets worse .
... they cannot hide .
you have made your victims &apos; lives hell .
now it &apos;s your turn .
this is the address of todd bratcher
and his friend , jesse martin .
this is the address of todd bratcher
and his friend , jesse martin .
it &apos;s not us .
it &apos;s anonymous .
you &apos;re anonymous .
there &apos;s more than one anonymous .
you had nothing to do with this video ?
not a thing .
then how did they know about the photo
we gave the judge .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe they &apos;re in court , watching .
they &apos;re not in the judge &apos;s chambers .
you don &apos;t know that .
oh , come on .
what ?
who else was in the judge &apos;s chambers ?
the court reporter or someone at your firm ?
you probably discussed what was said in chambers
back at your firm , right ?
any of them could be anonymous .
you know what i think , dylan ?
i think every single bit of this is you .
i think you enjoy creating paranoia
and confusion to help your cause .
and what cause is that ?
destroying in order to create .
maybe , but that video ,
it &apos;s not me .
why ?
i have a sense of humor .
we &apos;re not joining your class action .
why not ? out of pique ?
no , the firm changed its mind .
we &apos;re a democracy .
we do that .
i have enjoyed these last four weeks a lot .
well , it &apos;s good that you &apos;ve enjoyed yourself .
um , and i think i &apos;ve made a real impact .
so i hope you consider keeping me .
are you ready to work on your own ?
if that &apos;s what the partners want .
um , why don &apos;t you give us a minute , robyn ?
if you have any hesitations ,
i hope you give me a chance to respond .
certainly . thank you .
well , she sure is eager .
like working with minnie mouse .
kalinda ,
do you have anything to add ?
she &apos;s good .
keep her on .
i &apos;m declaring a mistrial .
your honor , that is grossly unfair .
you will be assigned a new trial date
and a new judge .
anything else ?
our client &apos;s contempt citation ?
remains in effect
until such time as your client wishes
to take the necessary action to cure it .
your honor , our client is still in jail .
it could be months before we get a new trial date .
yes , and your friends should &apos;ve thought of that .
anonymous is not our friend .
they made a mockery of this court ,
they instituted mob justice ,
made it impossible ...
justice for rainey selwin . justice now .
justice for rainey selwin . justice now .
justice for rainey selwin .
justice now .
yeah , i remember todd bratcher .
admitted everything .
the full nine .
yeah , then his lawyers got his confession tossed .
he was a hair under 17,
so we got burned for not notifying his folks
before questioning .
the kid skated , but i &apos;m past it .
yeah , well , the girl &apos;s not .
she &apos;s suing todd civilly .
i just wish we could use that confession .
i never knew a cop that didn &apos;t keep a copy for himself .
just in case iad got involved .
if ever there was a moment to do the right thing ,
this is it .

the important thing is to get in front of it
so i can tell the judge you cooperated .
did she say she wanted to have sex ?
i guess not .
did she say she wanted to have sex ?
i guess not .
your honor ,
you &apos;ve already declared a mistrial .
yes , but you &apos;re still the judge of record
until such time as ...
you can &apos;t let the actions of an anarchistic gang
control your rulings .
your honor , please ,
forget about everything else here .
me , him , anonymous .
rainey is being imprisoned for speaking the truth ,
and that is wrong .
this video proves it .
you did it .
