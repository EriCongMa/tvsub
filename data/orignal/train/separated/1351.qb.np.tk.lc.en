please , someone help me !
can anyone hear me ? ! please !
save me ! someone please help me !
i &apos;m on my way , ma &apos;am !
as fast as you can !
i &apos;ll fly at the speed of light .
no one should treat such a beautiful woman
to such evil .
what are you waiting for , my caped crusader ?
i will soon show you .
save me ,
and i &apos;ll reward your bravery ,
you big , strong superman .
baby ?
ronald , is everything okay ?
wanna go see a movie ?
we could go to the one that tells the story without words ,
where everyone communicates
through facial expression and movement .
&quot; blank stare &quot; ?
yeah , i was thinking more &quot; really quiet , &quot;
but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re right .
it did get great reviews .
it did ! right ?
and when you were reading them ,
i @-@ i know i heard you say the words
&quot; transcendent &quot; and &quot; evocative . &quot;
and i remember your response was &quot; boring &quot; and &quot; boring . &quot;
well , that was last week .
you know , before you and jack broke up .
i ... would love to see that film
this week .
maybe you should go on your own and tell me how it is .
and leave you ?
absolutely not .
we could go hiking ?
gardner museum ?
strolling ...
on the promenade ?
like french people ?
jane , it &apos;s okay . i &apos;m gonna be fine .
you will , as soon as i find the right activity .
what about a murder ?
yes ! murder ! mm !
huh ? rizzoli .
isles .
at least it will keep me from thinking about
how everything good in life turns to dust .
thattagirl .
except we are going to a crime scene --
okay , and we &apos;re walking . we &apos;re walking . uh ...
yes . go .
it &apos;s a plant . the ancient romans used it
as a natural form of birth control .
i &apos;m just saying , it &apos;s a terrible name for a hotel --
silphium suites --
even if it does conjure up images
of people in togas safely having naked orgies .
you can &apos;t have naked orgies if you --
i know . it didn &apos;t make sense as soon as i said it .
i realize that .
but it &apos;s just a terrible name for a hotel .
you know , uh , the silphium seed pod was heart @-@ shaped ,
which is why the symbol is now associated with love .
it works on many levels .
still doesn &apos;t roll off the tongue .
excessive use of the plant drove it into extinction .
you really miss jack , don &apos;t you ?
so much .
are you doing the screening of &quot; the three stooges &quot; later ?
guard hung it up before we got here .
is she alive ?
yeah .
then i &apos;ll take a look at our actual victim .
our victim is ronald wallace .
that &apos;s his wife linda .
her screams got the attention of a guest ,
who called security .
guard opened the door .
our keys don &apos;t open those handcuffs ?
no , they &apos;re british .
she was blindfolded when they came into the room .
got more hysterical when he tried to remove it .
paramedic thought she might hurt herself on the cuffs ,
so he sedated her .
when is she gonna wake up ?
couple hours minimum ,
depending on how much she had to drink .
front desk told me the couple stayed here often .
this time , they arrived separately .
they were both given cards . both cards were used .
and silphium is a plant .
what a stupid thing to name a hotel after .
it &apos;s a sex plant .
better , but still ...
frankie , can you check with housekeeping ?
see when they cleaned the room
and if they noticed anything usual .
will do .
thanks .
it appears that our victim suffered
a significant blow to the head .
mm . like from the footboard ?
the head wound is differentiated ,
which would be ...
consistent with an uneven object like that .
and i do see a dried , dark substance on the surface ,
but i can &apos;t be sure until after autopsy .
mm , maybe batman slipped when he tried to fly in
and save his mistress in distress .
batman didn &apos;t fly .
well , he ... leapt great distances
in a ... bat @-@ like and heroic manner .
yes , but that &apos;s not flying . not like superman .
let &apos;s track down the security guard .
maybe the wife said something before she started screaming .
why did superman fly ?
because of the stronger gravitational pull
on his home planet of krypton ,
earth &apos;s gravity had no affect on him .
well , then why didn &apos;t he fly all the time ?
i have no idea .
doctor at the hospital said
that the wife is still extremely agitated .
that &apos;s not surprising .
they &apos;re keeping her mildly sedated ,
but she &apos;s due to be released this afternoon .
maybe we can talk to her then .
look what c.s.r.u. found when the e.m.t.s moved her .
where was it ?
between the mattress and the bed frame .
why put it there ?
so it doesn &apos;t get lost during the festivities .
or so i hear .
anyway ... ronald wallace was 39 .
a real estate developer .
he and his wife have been married 15 years . no children .
any criminal record or outstanding warrants ?
no , but he does have a habit of making large cash withdrawals
from his corporate accounts .
any corresponding deposits to personal accounts ?
no . he also doesn &apos;t pay his bills in person .
the money wasn &apos;t hidden in the house ,
and there &apos;s no safety deposit box --
at least none we &apos;ve found .
so if he was murdered , maybe we &apos;ve got a motive .
and if he wasn &apos;t murdered ?
we got a big pile of money that really isn &apos;t our business .
find any kryptonite ?
mm , he clearly wasn &apos;t dressed as superman .
don &apos;t let her bait you .
maura , you &apos;re spoiling all my fun .
okay , then just for the record , no kryptonite .
the cause of death was blunt force trauma .
but given the force of the blow
against the stationary footboard ,
there should have been some sort of contrecoup injury
to the other opposite side of the victim &apos;s head .
but there wasn &apos;t ?
no .
the skull fracture requires 500 pounds of force .
this one might &apos;ve required more .
and since force = mass x acceleration --
this is physics , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
well , can i just sneak out the backdoor
and go to the little girls &apos; room like i did in high school ?
oh , i didn &apos;t know you took physics in high school .
well ... mark roberts was a very cute , very smart boy .
and what happened to mark roberts ?
he failed physics .
what ? it wasn &apos;t my fault .
it was totally my fault .
anyway , for the stationary footboard
to create that wound in our victim &apos;s skull ,
he would either &quot; a , &quot; had to have fallen 18 stories ,
&quot; b , &quot; have a head that weighs 5,500 pounds ,
&quot; c , &quot; have flown into the footboard
at 120 miles an hour ,
or &quot; d , &quot; some variable combination of these factors .
well , i didn &apos;t get any credit for that physics class ,
but i &apos;m guessing by the tone of your voice
that none of these things happened .
no .
so he was murdered .
the caped crusader has a nemesis .
yes .
or nemesi .
that isn &apos;t the plural of &quot; nemesis . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter . he &apos;s not a real superhero .
thank you .
thank you for coming in .
ronald traveled so much .
he just liked to go to the hotel every couple of weeks
and have a little fun .
you know , just -- just pretend .
i wish ...
he wouldn &apos;t have wanted to ... die like that .
we &apos;re handling everything with the utmost discretion .
of course . you &apos;ve all been so nice and ...
i &apos;m sorry .
i thought i was gonna be able to talk about this ,
but i don &apos;t know if i can .
well , we just have a few questions ,
and then we &apos;ll get you home , okay ?
okay .
did ronald have a drug problem ?
no .
did he owe money to anyone ?
no . why -- why would you think that ?
there were large cash withdrawals from his accounts .
we &apos;re just trying to figure out where that money went .
well , he was in real estate development .
contractors like to be paid in cash .
was the window open in your hotel room ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
before ronald died , did you hear anything ?
like what ?
is it possible that someone else was in the room with you ?
what are you saying ?
that this wasn &apos;t an accident ?
we suspect that ronald was murdered .
someone was ...
there ?
oh , my god .
did you hear anyone ?
no . the -- the music was so loud .
can you think of anything that might help us ?
there was a note .
what did it say ?
i don &apos;t know .
it was slipped under the door at our home .
it was addressed to ron .
he read it , he -- he folded it up ,
he put it back in his pocket .
i could tell he was upset .
but he just said that
the real estate deal had gone south , not to worry about it .
when was this ?
it was a month ago .
there were phone calls , too .
a few of them . hang @-@ ups .
but then they stopped .
i &apos;m sorry .
i went through our victim &apos;s cell phone records .
there were a lot of calls from a guy named larry price .
he and ron had a partnership that broke up last year .
they sued each other .
he write the note ?
he says no .
they settled out of court six weeks ago ,
and he has an airtight alibi for the day of the murder .
so far , it &apos;s not a very promising line of investigation .
the partnership broke up because ron made larry nervous .
he refused meat and potatoes jobs .
he was only interested in high risk / high return projects .
he was a gambler .
i asked if ron had a gambling problem .
larry said that he would &apos;ve bet on how long
it would take a cockroach to crawl under the sink .
and if he lost , if would &apos;ve doubled down
on how long it would take the cockroach to come back out .
well , maybe our vic got in deep with the wrong person .
see if you can find out who that was .
yeah .
hey , gwen told me you made the honor roll .
everyone makes the honor roll .
well , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
i just mean everyone who stays conscious ,
does their homework , and manages to resist the urge
to let the air out of their teacher &apos;s car tires .
high five .
kids don &apos;t let the air out of the teachers &apos; ... tires .
they do ?
well , where am i supposed to learn these things ?
did you hear back from the colleges ?
princeton .
i didn &apos;t get in .
no surprise .
my interview got a little bogged down
in the &quot; how i got shot while homeless &quot; questions .
seemed to make them uncomfortable .
i applied to a bunch of schools .
still waiting to hear back ...
including b.c.u.
i didn &apos;t know you were applying there .
you know , i know people on the committee .
i can make a call for you .
that &apos;s a really nice offer ,
but i wanna go where i &apos;m wanted .
and if you call them ,
then it &apos;s not about me .
i should go wash my hands before i dig in to these potato skins .
jane , we have to convince her to let me make the call .
no , we don &apos;t .
college admissions reward many things other than merit ,
and tasha should use any advantage she has .
but she &apos;s decided not to do that .
but maybe she -- - so we &apos;re going to accept that .
but what if she -- - because she &apos;s going to get in someplace great .
so ... now let &apos;s figure out more things that we can do
that will cheer you up . hmm ?
beanpot hockey tournament .
no .
visiting bass at the zoo .
a jewish music festival .
no .
what would cheer me up is getting tasha into b.c.u.
jewish music festival it is .
klezmer gives me a headache .
or not .
so are we dating anyone ?
tasha , i &apos;m a cop . do tell us about michael .
korsak texted me . did you find anything
to support your out @-@ of @-@ control gambler theory ?
i didn &apos;t . she did .
i was tracking his cell phone ,
and i noticed on the dates he took out the big cash deposits ,
his phone would move around the greater boston area .
no pattern i could find .
then the phone would head towards connecticut ,
and ...
what just happened ?
he took his phone offline .
why ?
no idea , but ...
every time it happened ,
a different number would ping off the same tower
almost immediately .
so ronald has another phone .
looks that way .
is it registered to him ?
not that we &apos;ve found yet .
but that second phone always traveled to a rural region of connecticut .
stays there a few days , then heads back to boston .
when it shuts off , then the other phone reactivates .
is there anything interesting in that part of connecticut ?
the mattatuck casino .
so maybe ronald did have a gambling problem
that followed him home .
want me to call the casino ?
no . they &apos;re a state licensed business .
if whatever happened there reflects badly on them ,
they won &apos;t be helpful .
so what do we do ?
you still keep that overnight bag packed and at the office ?
yes . you never know when you &apos;ll need a change of clothes
because of some corpse &apos;s gaseous liver explosion .
exactly . come on .
where ?
we &apos;re going on a road trip . come on !
and then i realized that the casino
is right next to that spa you mentioned .
the awuc transcendence center ?
yep .
the one with the sweat lodge ?
the one i asked you to go to six weeks ago ?
yep .
after everything that you &apos;ve been through
with losing frost , losing the baby ,
i thought it would be a good and healing experience for you ?
yeah .
and you said you &apos;d rather put forks in your eyes than go ?
yeah , we &apos;re talking about the same place .
what are you working on ?
uh , just having trouble with this cad / cam program .
i &apos;m using the x @-@ ray of the wound from the victim &apos;s skull
to try to identify a murder weapon .
hmm . find the murderer through the weapon .
it seemed like a great idea ,
except every time i run the analysis ,
it keeps telling me
that the murder weapon was the footboard .
but physics has already proven that not to be true ,
so i must &apos;ve loaded the data wrong .
mm , you &apos;ll figure it out .
yes , i will .
later , &apos; cause i brought a mix tape !
thanks , jane .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
for both of us .
* make a wish , baby *
* well , and i will make it come true *
* ain &apos;t no risk now *
* let my love rain down on you *
* so we could wash away the past *
* so that we may start anew *
hello , detective vince .
hi , judith . how &apos;d your husband &apos;s surgery go ?
flying colors , if the colors are black and blue .
but the doctors say he &apos;s gonna be okay .
well , i &apos;m glad to hear it .
the food from the department was very nice .
detective frankie jr . i like your haircut .
thanks , judith .
i &apos;m headed out , unless you need help with that .
oh , no , no , no . this isn &apos;t work .
it &apos;s just the results of my practice lieutenant &apos;s exam .
how &apos;d you do ?
92 % .
well , last year , didn &apos;t everyone who got better than 89 % make lieutenant ?
i think so .
can i take you out for a beer to celebrate ?
some other time . thanks .
okay . well , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
that &apos;s a very good score .
why aren &apos;t you happier ?
i guess .
it &apos;s about what i expected .
you &apos;re a bad liar , detective vince .
i barely slept last night . i was so excited !
yes . me , too ! i was so excited for you .
really ? you were snoring .
well , that &apos;s how i hide my sleeplessness .
you know , the concept of ritual sweating
is a global phenomenon .
everyone always gloms on to the good ideas .
it isn &apos;t always associated
with ceremonial or mystical significance .
turkish baths , for instance . mm .
what are you gonna do with your gun ?
nothing .
she needs to check in . dr. maura isles .
i thought we were doing this the together .
no . i &apos;m going to go investigate a murder .
jane , you said this would be healing .
we both need healing .
and i believe in the ...
healing power of crime solving .
oh , jane .
maura .
come on . i know that you &apos;re really gonna love this .
and i know that i would really not love this .
that &apos;s not the reason that you won &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re just afraid of what it will stir up .
i &apos;m not going in because ... well , i don &apos;t need to .
okay , the way that i &apos;m processing --
you mean not at all ?
my way works for me .
okay ? i &apos;m fine .
maura , i &apos;m totally fine .
dr. isles ?
if you &apos;ll follow me .
go . have a good time . i &apos;ll pick you up later .
and we &apos;re following and we &apos;re walking .
and we &apos;re smiling .
and i &apos;m leaving .
okay , thanks .
well , the casino circulated that photo you sent me ,
and , uh , chief of security says nobody recognized him .
is he someone you trust to be straight with you ?
yes .
the casino works hard to stay on my good side
so i don &apos;t make trouble for the folks
who zoom in and out of there all weekend .
so if your guy &apos;s a high roller , it &apos;s not here .
is there any other trouble in the area that he could get into ?
well , we &apos;re not a big department ,
but i feel like we would run into him ...
if he were into something sticky .
okay . thank you .
you bet .
rizzoli .
jane , we &apos;ve struck out connecting
our victim to anything concrete in connecticut .
yeah , no driver &apos;s license . no credit cards .
no real estate transactions .
no utility bills . the guy &apos;s a ghost .
hang on a second . excuse me .
do you recognize him ?
yeah . i don &apos;t remember his name ,
but he was in a couple of months ago
for a gun registration .
uh , nina , did you check connecticut gun registry ?
yeah . there was nothing . let me check again .
uh , would you be able to pull up his paperwork ?
sure . it &apos;ll take me a while , but i don &apos;t mind .
thank you .
alan wallace .
should &apos;ve caught it . he used his middle name .
okay . hang on a second .
um , thank you . i &apos;m -- i &apos;m good .
hey , nina , get me an address .
hi . can i help you ?
yes . um , i &apos;m jane rizzoli .
i &apos;m a detective with boston p.d.
uh , do you live here ?
yes .
i &apos;m looking for a ronald wallace .
you might know him as alan .
alan .
so you know him ?
yes . he &apos;s my husband .
who gets to plan the funeral ? her or me ?
i don &apos;t know .
when did the two of you get married ?
about 18 months ago .
i mean , we -- we dated for a year before that .
we ...
we met in a bowling alley . he was with a client .
what kind of work did he do ?
he was a sales rep for a building supply company .
at least , that &apos;s what he told me .
now did he have any trouble with anyone ?
no .
whenever he came here ,
he always brought large amounts of cash .
do you now if anybody here knew about that ?
that was their money , wasn &apos;t it ?
his and his other ...
i &apos;m sorry , cynthia .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think it &apos;s appropriate for me to talk about ronald ...
alan , um , and his other life .
everything we were ,
everything we did , it was all fake .
none of it means anything .
you could still help us find who killed him .
how ? i @-@ i don &apos;t even know him .
nothing i know is true .
oh , god .
hi .
so she wouldn &apos;t stay focused on my questions .
or couldn &apos;t .
what &apos;s her alibi ?
she was home ,
alone , &apos; cause her two @-@ timing husband was out of town .
well , if she wrote the note and made the hang @-@ up calls ,
she knew about the relationship .
yeah , which means she could &apos;ve also known
about the regular trips to the hotel .
but it still doesn &apos;t answer the question
of how she got in the room .
it was a first floor room .
it &apos;s easy enough to climb through the window
left open by housekeeping .
or to be let in by housekeeping .
all right , i &apos;ll look at the staff again .
maybe we &apos;ll find something .
all right . well , at least we figured out his superpower .
what was it ?
bigamy .
at first , it was just hot ,
and then it was hot and sweaty .
and then i started to smell something .
no , like , um , a flower .
or the universe .
and then it was just like ... boom !
my head just exploded .
exploded ?
everything that had been weighing on me --
the cad / cam program
or tasha , jack , you --
they all just resolved themselves .
they did ?
well , it &apos;s not like they &apos;re magically fixed .
but i feel like i just got some insights and revelations
that would just help me move forward .
you gonna tell me what those are ?
no .
are you mad because i didn &apos;t go sweat and smell with you ?
well , i &apos;m not happy that you made me think you were going .
sin of omission , maura .
and if i hadn &apos;t have done it , you wouldn &apos;t have gone .
maybe . but i &apos;m not mad .
i think that everything you said was 100 % right .
that ambrosia is an underappreciated band ?
no . that we all have our own way of dealing with things .
but ambrosia is a wonderful band .
right ?
nothing solid from the hotel staff .
no one has a criminal record ,
no fingerprints in the room that shouldn &apos;t be .
and the maid who cleans the room
swears she didn &apos;t leave the window open .
we haven &apos;t made a dent in cynthia &apos;s alibi , either .
cell phone stays put . no movement on her ez pass .
can &apos;t find her on the cameras at the train or the bus station
the days before and after the murder .
can we at least put her around
linda and ronald &apos;s house at some point ?
not based on her cell phone or credit cards .
the woman never leaves connecticut .
i mean , if we had something ,
we could take a run at her , try to break her ,
but we ...
we &apos;ve got nothing .
hey , maura .
okay .
okay .
she wants to see all of us .
we here for a self @-@ defense seminar ?
no , you &apos;re here to see one of the fruits
of my sweat lodge revelations .
i &apos;d been struggling with this cad / cam program
i &apos;d been using .
it kept indicating that our victim ron
was killed by the footboard of the bed ,
even though the physics of that made it impossible .
but in the sweat lodge ,
i realized that the program was right .
oh , it &apos;s the same pattern as the footboard .
virtually .
i used a 3 @-@ d rendering
to have it laser @-@ carved out of a piece of wood
at a shop down the street .
oh . go , sweat lodge .
so something like this might be our murder weapon .
might be ?
well , it could generate the wound pattern on his forehead .
but the question is ,
could anyone swing it hard enough to do so ?
so which if you is the best user of a bat ?
not me .
jane . jane .
yes . i am a good user of the bat .
great .
so you will need to generate a bat speed
of at least 68 miles per hour .
well , that seems fast .
it is fast .
but if properly placed , should generate the force necessary .
ready , susie ?
norm is ready , detective rizzoli .
norm ?
he &apos;s my uncle .
my apologies , norm .
well , he left my aunt for a barista .
screw norm .
50 .
come on !
well , the curve ball kinda left you hanging there , janie .
you wanna step in for norm , frankie ?
56 .
you got anymore , slugger ?
not without beer .
maybe our killer was a man .
or just a former college all @-@ star .
when i did background on cynthia ,
i read she got a scholarship .
4 @-@ year starter .
well , what do you know ?
there is no joy in mudville . mighty casey has struck out .
maura calculated the velocity of cynthia &apos;s swing in that video .
65 miles an hour at point of impact .
hell , we could use her on the softball team .
yeah , except you make a bad play , maybe she murders you .
well , there &apos;s a big difference between muffing a ground ball
and having another wife .
maybe .
we need to find the murder weapon
or figure out where she bought it
or placed her in boston at the time of the murder ,
or all of the above .
well , i &apos;ll get nina on the research .
oh , she &apos;s already on it .
i &apos;ve got a search warrant in process in connecticut .
sheriff will meet you at cynthia &apos;s house .
so i &apos;m done eating ?
no , as long as you &apos;re also walking .
hey , take the whole thing . bring me the basket later .
i &apos;ll call you from connecticut .
bye , frankie .
bye , ma .
hey , you want something to eat ?
oh , i had a granola bar at the vending machine .
okay , that &apos;s not food .
there &apos;s a burger ready to come out . let me get it for you .
that &apos;s a customer &apos;s order .
yeah .
but they &apos;ll wait and drink some more beer .
frankie told me about your , uh ,
score on the lieutenant exam .
congratulations .
when &apos;s the real one ?
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m gonna take it .
why ?
do i really wanna finish my career behind a desk ?
well , that &apos;s a good question .
exactly .
i think kiki and i --
you realize that you light up every time you mention her name ?
might be time to ask her out .
i &apos;ve had three failed marriages .
i just ...
kiki deserves better .
oh , come on . your three ex @-@ wives wouldn &apos;t recognize you .
and kiki would be a fool to let you go .
i &apos;m gonna grab you that burger .
hey . how was connecticut ?
did you find a big pile of murder weapon shavings
next to a wood chipper ?
no . mnh .
but we did find this
under the carpeting in the trunk of cynthia &apos;s car .
in the frenzy of planning the murder ,
she must &apos;ve forgotten it was there .
a burner phone .
yep . no fingerprints .
but nina confirmed that it was used
to make three short calls to ron &apos;s house
in the timeline the first wife gave us for hang @-@ ups .
seems like a pretty big mistake
in an otherwise buttoned @-@ up crime .
if criminals didn &apos;t make mistakes , we &apos;d never catch them .
true .
how did she get in the room ?
i mean , did our victim let her in ?
and why would he do that ?
and if she was already hiding there ,
then wouldn &apos;t they hear her crawling out
with her gigantic murder weapon ?
where you going with this ?
well , it &apos;s always the spouse .
just in this case , we have two .
they did it together .
it &apos;s the only thing that makes sense .
how do we prove it ?
i have no idea .
so ... what now ?
well , now we do the only logical thing .
we drink .
how did a sweat lodge get you to a laser @-@ carved baseball bat ?
just a whisper of insight .
as sherlock holmes said ,
&quot; eliminate all of the impossible solutions .
whatever &apos;s left , however improbable , is the answer . &quot;
seems like he could &apos;ve said that in fewer words .
but okay , so tell me about
some of the other sweat lodge revelations .
you mean about you ?
sure .
you really wanna know ?
mm @-@ hmm .
no , you don &apos;t .
i said &quot; yes . &quot;
no , the cop part of you that wants answers said &quot; yes . &quot;
but you &apos;ve convinced me that the other part of you
really wants to figure it out on your own .
i fear that the sweat lodge was not beneficial
to the clarity of our conversations .
you ready to go ?
no , i have to ask korsak something .
are you okay ?
hmm ? yes . i am .
sorry . just thinking about the case .
um , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow morning .
yeah .
all right .
bye guys .
good night .
so i wanna tell you about another idea i had
at the sweat lodge .
wow . all that discomfort really worked for you .
it did . anyway , this is about tasha .
you want me to go grab jane so you can tell us all at once ?
no , no . i wanna get all my ducks in a row before i talk to her .
i &apos;m all ears .
me , too .
well , i went to the admissions office at b.c.u.
i didn &apos;t help her because jane said that i couldn &apos;t .
but it turns out she didn &apos;t need my help .
she got in on her own .
oh , good for tasha .
yeah . but we have a different problem .
wait !
wait !
wait !
no !
detective jane ?
hi , judith .
did you put this here ?
yes . sorry .
i went to get a clean cloth .
since detective barry died ,
i try to clean his desk when no one is here .
that &apos;s very nice . thank you .
detective jane ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know why ,
but i feel ...
i feel like i wanna tell you that everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
you want me to put the blue guy back where he belongs ?
no .
no , he &apos;s fine right here .
okay . okay .
good night , detective jane .
good night .
um , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s keeping her . i &apos;m so sorry .
i @-@ i &apos;ve already told you everything i know .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know
how detective rizzoli thinks i can help .
there &apos;s just a few little things .
uh , i know this must be hard . how you doing ?
i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m still in shock , i guess ,
as i &apos;m sure you can imagine .
you &apos;ve obviously been around
a lot of people who are mourning over a loss --
how long should we let her stew ?
at least until she gets antsy .
if she looks like she &apos;s gonna bolt ,
you can go in there and use your charm .
how &apos;d you get this idea ?
frost .
i know . i know you don &apos;t believe in that sort of thing .
this happens many more times , i &apos;ll have no choice .
i know that &apos;s not the murder weapon .
it &apos;s probably in some wood chipper somewhere .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you and linda probably stood there together ,
made sure that it couldn &apos;t be traced back to you ,
ordering it by mail to a p.o. box ,
using a money order .
i think i &apos;d like to go .
this is a burner phone we found in the trunk of your car .
it made calls to ronald &apos;s house . short ones .
hang @-@ ups , we hear .
do you know how we know that they were hang @-@ ups ?
linda told us .
did you meet nina ?
she &apos;s in charge of incriminating evidence .
there was a note .
what did it say ?
i don &apos;t know . it was slipped under the door at our home .
it was addressed to ron .
he read it , he -- he folded it up ,
he put it back in his pocket .
i could tell he was upset . but he just said that
the real estate deal had gone south , not to worry about it .
when was this ?
it was a month ago .
there were phone calls , too .
a few of them . hang @-@ ups .
but then they stopped .
the moment we pegged this as a murder ,
she turned on you .
she even planted the phone just in case .
so think back to all the times that you were together ,
when she had a chance to get in the trunk of your car ,
and then i &apos;ll need you to answer my question .
what question ?
well , she wanted ronald dead ,
and in a perfect world ,
she wanted you to take the fall for it .
so my question is ,
were you smart enough to see this coming
and protect yourself ?
detective rizzoli , after all i &apos;ve been through ,
it seems cruel to keep me -- - save it , linda .
cynthia has a recording of them planning the murder .
helpful .
linda wallace , you &apos;re under arrest
for the murder of ronald wallace .
come on .
what did he see in her ?
i &apos;m sure she &apos;s asking the same thing .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used against you .
moscow mule , table 10 .
when exactly did ginger beer become indispensable ?
did you call kiki yet ?
she &apos;s coming by later .
coming by coming by ?
well , it &apos;s not a date .
we &apos;re gonna talk about winding down our professional relationship
and what might follow .
but coming by the bar ...
it &apos;s a good sign , huh ?
thank you .
for what ?
encouragement .
i mean , who knows what happens ,
but i feel like a new man already .
you &apos;re welcome .
then his 5 @-@ color pen
rolls into the flames on his desk
and totally melted .
okay , you realize that
only nerds think this is funny .
only a person without a sense of humor
would not think that this is funny .
agree to disagree .
agree that you &apos;re a stick in the mud .
nobody &apos;s ever said that to me in my entire life !
so what &apos;s up ?
okay , you guys are creeping me out .
maura , go ahead . tell her .
you tell her .
no , no , no . it &apos;s a sweat lodge thing . go ahead .
well , we heard about but did nothing to facilitate
your acceptance into b.c.u.
and we also heard that the financial aid offer was ...
shitty .
watch your mouth .
sorry .
so our very own vince korsak has organized
a b.p.d. scholarship for deserving students ,
and you are this year &apos;s recipient .
i @-@ i am ?
how ?
well , you met all the qualifications .
you &apos;re a great kid . you &apos;re a great student .
you were ... trapped in an elevator with a detective .
you were shot .
the barry frost memorial scholarship .
this is amazing .
congratulations .
ah ! congrats .
so who was barry frost ?
uh , he -- he was a friend .
and -- and he &apos;s gonna watch over you .
come on , tasha .
let &apos;s mix you up some virgin something
or other to celebrate .
good job .
obviously , barry &apos;s scholarship
was sweat lodge revelation number two .
well , i only had it
because you wouldn &apos;t let me call the admissions office
and help her .
thank you .
what did we learn about jack ?
he &apos;s awesome .
well , we knew that .
and if an awesome guy like that
found his way to me , then ...
another awesome guy will find his way to you .
exactly .
and the next awesome person
doesn &apos;t have to show up for a while .
okay .
do you wanna hear my revelation about you ?
no , i @-@ i got my own .
you did ?
okay , you can wipe the surprised look off your face .
yeah , i did .
i was so focused on work and family and you ,
and -- and you were right .
i was afraid of what would happen
if i couldn &apos;t keep my feelings in -- in that little box .
but i don &apos;t have to be afraid anymore .
i got a message .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
so i know , no matter what happens , i can handle it .
jane rizzoli &apos;s strong enough to handle it .
okay , what is happening with your face now ?
that was my sweat lodge revelation about you .
it was not .
no , it was .
it was not . you &apos;re just saying that becase i &apos;m saying it .
why would i do that ?
dramatic effect . positive reinforcement .
i would never .
you would !
like the time i got into the fight with that mime .
remember ? you jumped in and you fake budged in .
that was totally different .
it &apos;s not !
