look at us , getting ready for a double date
with actual women who publicly acknowledge
they &apos;re our girlfriends .
yes , actual women are the best .
i don &apos;t understand .
what other kind of women are there ?
howard , artificial women are your department .
you want to take this ?
no , it would just freak him out .
listen , before we leave ,
i should warn you , i &apos;m a passionate man
and i tend towards public displays of affection .
what are you trying to tell me , howard ?
there might be some making out in the car or the restaurant ,
and i don &apos;t want bernadette to feel uncomfortable ,
so it would help if you and penny made out , too .
don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;re planning to have sex right on the salad bar .
namaste , white people .
good news !
i rented us the four @-@ hour edition of watchmen .
got it .
seen it .
detailed analysis posted online .
well , then what are we going to do tonight ?
uh , sorry , raj .
howard and i are going out to dinner
with penny and bernadette .
yeah .
no more carefree bachelor nights for me and leonard .
these broncos have been saddled .
how did we get actual women ?
great .
they get girlfriends , and they just abandon us ?
it is great , isn &apos;t it ?
we have a wonderful evening ahead of us .
we do ?
oh , yes . i just discovered i don &apos;t have
enough room ony hard drive for a linux partition ,
so you and i are going to perform a full backup ,
reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems .
i don &apos;t want to do that .
all right .
well , i &apos;m going to perform full backup ,
reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems .
what about me
well , i understand there are several types of artificial women .
maybe you should look into that .
dude , there &apos;s so many cool things
we could be doing tonight . look .
at the glendale galleria ,
&quot; put on your best zoot suit
&quot; it &apos;s a salute to swing music in the center court near macy &apos;s .
5 p.m. to 9 p.m. &quot;
huh ? huh ?
a salute to zoot .
sounds like a hoot .
i &apos;m sorry , raj ,
i have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight .
much less one that &apos;s linked to race riots in the 1940s .
race riots ?
the zoot suit riots .
oh .
i always thought that was some sort of after @-@ christmas sale .
well , then why don &apos;t we just go to the galleria and walk around ?
but i don &apos;t need anything at the galleria .
do you need anything at the galleria ?
no . we would just walk around and see what &apos;s what .
that &apos;s a semantically null sentence .
okay , well , how about this ?
from the university web site :
7 p.m to 10 : 00 p.m. , norton hall multipurpose room ,
&quot; mixer for grad student and faculty
of the science and humanities departments .
&quot; whether you split atoms or infinitives ,
this is the place to be . &quot;
well , that &apos;s certainly amusing , but ...
i have no interest .
come on , sheldon ,
the world is filled with people doing things outside .
let &apos;s go outside .
outside is good .
outside is so good , why has mankind spent thousands of years
trying to perfect inside ?
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s a marketing scheme .
please , sheldon , i &apos;m a young ,
virile visitor from a foreign land
and i need to strut my stuff .
let me offer you a compromise .
sometimes when i feel stifled and want a change of scenery ,
i use my imagination .
oh , boy .
one of my favorite places
to visit is the two dimensional world
described in edwin abbott &apos;s mathematal fantasy ,
&quot; flatland . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to go to flatland .
you &apos;re only saying that becae you haven &apos;t been there .
i am now a hexagon in two @-@ dimensional space
and can only perceive the edges of other objects .
oy .
is that you , raj ?
i don &apos;t recognize your edge .
sheldon , i &apos;m begging you .
i want to go to this mixer , and i don &apos;t want to go alone .
well , you &apos;re in luck .
there &apos;s a mixer here in flatland
oh , look , the &apos;s a sexually attractive line segment
you should chat her up .
what ?
tell her you &apos;re a circle .
flatland gals are all hot for circles .
i hope you &apos;re hungry , beadette .
we &apos;re going to a terrific restaurant .
oh , yeah , i &apos;m starved .
when you spend all day in a bio @-@ lab ,
watching flesh @-@ eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents ,
it really works up an appetite .
flesh @-@ eating bacteria .
and yet , i still want to kiss this woman .
what does that tell you ?
that you &apos;d be willing to die a horrible death
on the off @-@ chance you &apos;d get to second base ?
oh , we &apos;re way past second base .
right , howard ?
well , we kind of disagree
about what the bases are .
how &apos;s your work going , penny ?
any acting jobs ?
well , the last big thing i did was this production
of diary of anne frank above a bowling alley .
but i think things might be turning around pretty soon .
great . how come ?
well , promise you won &apos;t make fun of me .
of course , i would never make fun of you .
okay .
well , i went to this psychic who told me that if i cut my hair ,
i &apos;m going to get a national commercial .
wh ... seriously ?
you &apos;re getting career advice from a psychic ?
good job not making fun of her .
she &apos;s not one of those phonies , okay .
she wrote a book and has her own web site .
oh , gee , why didn &apos;t you say so ?
they don &apos;t let just anyone have a web site .
why are you being such a jerk ?
you &apos;re surprised ?
your psychic tell you i was going to be a jerk ?
bite me .
come on , penny .
why don &apos;t you kids go ahead and chat ?
we &apos;re gonna make out back here .
i &apos;m sliding into third .
thanks for coming with me .
thanks for giving me
your limited edition green lantern lantern .
did you really have to bring it in with you ?
what if evil strikes and my power ring runs low ?
come on , let &apos;s get a drink .
i don &apos;t drink .
yeah , well i do .
and when my wingman is carrying a green lantern lantern ,
i drink a lot .
i &apos;ll have a screwdriver , please .
don &apos;t be chintzy with the screw .
i would like a root beer float .
sheldon , they don &apos; have ice cream .
they don &apos;t ?
well , apparently , these people and i differ greatly
on the definition of &quot; party . &quot;
he &apos;ll have a shirley temple .
and don &apos;t be chintzy with the shirley .
okay ,
let &apos;s check out the females .
all right .
there &apos;s a female .
that &apos;s professor wilkinson &apos;s wife .
she &apos;s like 80 years old .
but she &apos;s female .
isn &apos;t that the game ?
no .
i &apos;m looking for a hookup .
oh , yes .
so , the point of this exercise is
for you to find someone to copulate with ?
not so loud ,
but ideally , yes .
thanks .
thank you .
and what is my function as &quot; wingman &quot; ?
you help me run my game .
okay .
what is your game ?
when i lie through my teeth to a woman ,
you nod and agree .
hey , that &apos;s pretty cool .
what is it ?
it &apos;s a limited edition
green lantern lantern .
my friend is looking for someone to copulate with .
you &apos;re very funny .
i &apos;m abby .
i &apos;m sheldon .
how do you do ?
rajesh ramayan koothrappali .
call me raj .
hi , raj .
where are you from ?
the mysterious subcontinent of india .
ooh , india .
you know india ?
i saw slumdog millionaire .
well , i &apos;m a slumdog astrophysicist .
i thought your father was a gynecologist .
i &apos;m sorry .
martha , come here .
meet raj and sheldon .
this is my friend , martha .
hi .
hello .
hello .
is that the limited edition
green lantern lantern ?
&quot; in brightest day , in darkest night ,
no evil shall escape my sight . &quot;
oh , that is so awesome !
thank you .
have you chosen one to copulate with ?
so , what should we talk about ?
well , we could always learn more
about why people who believe in psychics are idiots .
leonard ?
oh , we don &apos;t need to talk about that anymore .
leonard covered it pretty well in the car .
i &apos;m sorry , but facts are facts .
right , and if you can &apos;t understand it ,
it &apos;s not a fact .
no , if it &apos;s not a fact , it &apos;s not a fact .
oh , got it .
thank you for educating me .
you &apos;re welcome .
how &apos;s your fish ?
amazing .
would you like to try some ?
yeah , sure .
well , the fact is ,
you can &apos;t .
come on , howard , bernadette , you &apos; both scientists .
help me out here .
what do you think-- want to jump
right in the middle of another couple &apos;s argument ?
no , thank you .
sorry .
maybe we suld just stop talking about this .
maybe some of us should stop talking altogether .
how is everything tonight ?
really uncomfortable .
you know , the best thing about being in a committed ,
monogamous , mutually supportive relationship
is that even if you have different idea ,
you can have a spirited debate , yet still care for ,
even make love with ...
want your fish ?
i knew you were going to do that .
doesn &apos;t make me psychic !
attaboy , leonard make it worse .
what &apos;s going on ?
we scored .
i &apos;m the wingman .
hey .
laser .
had a great night last night .
i don &apos;t like to kiss and tell ,
but somebody made it to eighth base .
what the hell is eighth base ?
seventh base with shirt off .
well , my shirt .
how &apos;d things go with penny ?
oh ... couldn &apos;t be better .
are we taking our relationship
frustrations out on innocent cylons ?
it &apos;s not just cylons .
superman &apos;s next .
all right , i was going to try to squeeze in
a little more mocking before lunch ,
but i can come back later
when you don &apos;t have a high @-@ powered weapon .
how can i go out with a woman who believes in psychics ?
hey , i once dated a girl
who believed she was abducted by aliens .
and that didn &apos;bother you ?
au contraire .
it meant she was gullible and open to a little probing .
what am i supposed to ,
pretend i believe something i don &apos;t whenever i &apos;m with penny ?
yes , i &apos;m sure penny fakes all kinds of things
when she &apos;s with you .
do me a favor-- lean or , put your head right here .
let me show you anothe way to look at this .
here we have the universe of all women .
these are the ones
you want to sleep with .
these are the women who believe exactly what you believe .
these are the women who would be willing to sleep with you .
and right there in the little triple intersection ...
is your ideal mate .
odds are she &apos;s a short physicist with low self @-@ esteem
who lives in a government research facility in china .
what &apos;s your point ?
in order to keep hing a sexual relationship with penny ,
i have to give up everything i believe in--
my intellectual integrity , the very nature
of who i am ?
i can &apos;t do that , howard .
i respect that .
what is that ?
your new girlfriend .
have fun tonight .
the dog ...
koira .
the roof ...
katto
grapes ...
ryp leet
one minute .
sis n
what was that ?
it means &quot; come in . &quot;
it &apos;s taking forever to load
the new operating system on my computer .
i disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom ,
and now i thought i &apos;d learn finnish .
that &apos;s hindi for
&quot; whatever floats your bought . &quot;
uh , listen , i got a text from that girl abby ,
and she and her friend martha want to hang out with us again .
what do you say ?
i don &apos;t say anything .
i merely offer you facial expression
that suggests you &apos;ve gone insane
i don &apos;t get it.you had a great time .
yes , exactly , i had a great time .
that &apos;s done ; i &apos;ve moved on to other things .
for example , after i learn finnish ,
i &apos;m not going to learn finnish again
please , sheldon , i &apos;m a lost indian boy
far from home , and i want a girlfriend
and i want her to be abby ,
and she &apos;ll only come over if she can bring martha .
raj , i highly doubt there is any argument you can make ,
threat you might levy , rhetorical strategy ,
plea , invocation ,
supplication , or ... vetoomus
that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider .
my incredible hulk hand signed by stan lee .
oh , my .
i &apos;ve admired these for years .
so does that mean we can go with the girls again ?
hulk agree to second date with puny humans !
you can &apos;t wear the hands on the date .
hulk sad .
cleaning out the old dryer lint , huh ?
not only is it courteous ,
it &apos;s safety smart .
every year , 15,000 fires are caused
by accidental dryer lint ignition .
now you &apos;re supposed to say ,
&quot; wow , what an interesting fact .
&quot; come here , you crazy , nerdy guy .
i could never be mad at you . &quot;
wow , that &apos;s all you got
after you were the most obnoxious person
on a double date that included howard wolowitz ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i really am .
it &apos;s not right to mock what a person believes in .
thank you .
would you be willing to go to my psychic
and see what it &apos;s all about ?
would you be willing to read a book
that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds ?
i would not .
okay , let &apos;s go see your psychic .
really ?
well , yeah , one of us has to keep an open mind .
you saying i don &apos;t have an open mind ?
no , n @-@ not at all . let me help you with this stuff .
you know , believe in ghosts , too .
great .
and astrology .
i know , and pyramid power and healing crystals .
oh , no , no , no , crystals don &apos;t work .
really , that &apos;s the line ?
psychics are real , but crystals are voodoo
oh , voodoo &apos;s real .
you don &apos;t want t mess with voodoo .
flatland is more than just a mathematical essay .
it is also a treatise on victorian social
you know i had never considered that .
wow , that &apos;s going to
completely change my visits there .
well , it &apos;s late .
time for bed .
okay .
good night , beauty human .
sheldon ?
yes ?
listen , they &apos;re kind of
getting busy in the living room , and ...
i was wondering if i could hang out in here for a while .
well , i suppose .
come in .
