what ?
nothing .
you look ... presidential .
from your mouth to god &apos;s ear .
look at eli gold in tails .
what ?
wow , the men are really sensitive tonight .
you look good , eli .
i swear , if you start clocking my alcohol intake ,
i am going to do shots .
okay .
now , would we all like to know our goal
for this shamrock dinner ?
to have a good time ?
no .
at the end of the night ,
cardinal james is going to make a choice .
he &apos;s going to shake hands with one candidate
and he &apos;s going to hug the other .
historically , that hug means a bump of 800,000
catholic votes .
you need those votes to beat kresteva .
so , i shouldn &apos;t mention abortion ?
alicia , you are saint alicia .
i know you don &apos;t like that , but you are .
so , please , tonight , just go with it .
you &apos;re seen as a paragon of faithful wives .
you stood by your man , you never strayed ...
good evening , everyone .
hey , will .
peter , hi .
thanks for the invite .
no , thank you .
i never got a chance to thank you
for promoting alicia to partner .
oh , well , no thanks necessary .
everything she earned , she earned on her own .
okay .
i &apos;m going to go find a bar .
can i have a red wine please ?
alicia florrick .
mike kresteva .
happy saint patrick &apos;s day .
i thought i &apos;d find you at the bar .
club soda , lime , no ice .
oh , that &apos;s right , you can &apos;t drink .
not can &apos;t , don &apos;t .
still holding a grudge , are we ?
what grudge ?
you didn &apos;t do something wrong , did you ?
bob , margot .
no , i didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re in a funny mood .
well , i have decided life is too short not to be honest .
mm , let &apos;s see how that goes .
what &apos;s your husband &apos;s strategy for beating me ?
using me .
my status with women to take the female vote .
i like this side of you .
and what about me are you worried most about ?
your psychopathic ability to lie and pretend it &apos;s the truth .
really ?
you do mein kampf proud .
you know , there must be some kind of
conversational equivalent to godwin &apos;s law ,
because we &apos;ve been talking for less than a minute
and you &apos;ve already compared me to hitler .
you know the problem with bad people ,
is they use the arguments of good people .
the problem with good people is they think
of themselves as good people .
okay , well , this has been fun .
die choking on your own blood , please .
that &apos;s nice .
mrs. florrick , do you have a minute ?
ah , is something wrong ?
no , we just need to talk to you for a few minutes ,
if you don &apos;t mind .
is there something i can help you with , detective ?
no , thank you , sir .
uh , ma &apos;am .
your eminence .
mike , how are you ?
beautiful evening , isn &apos;t it ?
it is that .
what was that all about .
oh , mrs. florrick ?
the detective just asked her to go with him .
peter florrick &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s odd .
i hope she &apos;s all right .
well , i hope it &apos;s not about her son again .
what is it ?
we have a time sensitive matter
and we need you to look at some evidence .
is it my kids ?
no , ma &apos;am .
uh , one of your clients was murdered tonight .
oh , my god .
that &apos;s your client ?
yes .
matthew ashbaugh ?
and do you recognize that man ?
no .
do you recognize the vehicle ?
no . when did this happen ?
three hours ago , on state street .
did mr. ashbaugh have any enemies ?
yes .
he did , who ?
many .
okay , the thing is , mrs. florrick ,
our worry is that that man
is still out there .
we have reason to believe he &apos;s not done killing tonight .
you have reason ?
evidence .
at the scene .
i can &apos;t go into detail at this time .
keep it down , please .
lawsuits often breed grudges , mrs. florrick .
so , could you tell us what cases you worked on with him ?
well , there were 18 .
18 cases ?
yes .
and how many were ongoing ?
eighteen .
he was very ...
litigious .
doug . come on .
okay , i have to interview a witness right now .
could you write down anyone who was an enemy ?
anyone you think might want him dead .
why do you want to sue ?
his dog &apos;s barking .
that must be difficult for you .
what are the damages ?
loss of &quot; consor @-@ tium . &quot;
consortium .
loss of consortium .
with who ?
somebody i might want to consort with .
you &apos;re laughing at me .
why are you laughing at me ?
because you seem intent on making enemies .
you can &apos;t sue the phone company .
this is america ; you can sue anybody .
we &apos;re not done with your other two lawsuits .
it &apos;s called multitasking , alicia .
now , look at me , i am talking to you
and i am designing the architecture
for new encryption software .
well , you are much smarter than me .
well , maybe i should look for another lawyer .
yes , please .
fire me .
please .
no , no .
oh , no .
you &apos;re not getting away from me that easily .
alicia , this is mr. matthew ashbaugh ,
the designer of baugh tech ,
a web @-@ based streaming program .
oh , it &apos;s a pleasure to meet you .
why ?
why ... is it a pleasure to meet you ?
because you &apos;re a wealthy new client
and i want to make a good impression .
you--
you travel with your own soundtrack ?
yes .
don &apos;t you ?
no .
well , i &apos;ll leave you two to get better acquainted .
my problem isn &apos;t the music .
my problem is the music over and over .
you don &apos;t like bach ?
i love bach .
but i don &apos;t love the same bach song
over and over .
mrs. florrick , &quot; bach song &quot; ?
why do the smartest people hide their learning ?
to compensate for those who show off their learning .
i play the same &quot; bach song &quot;
because then they &apos;ll get bored and stop listening to me .
ah . so , the cia is listening to you ?
mm , the bliss of the unparanoid .
lucky me .
so , how we doing ?
all of these ?
did he have any altercations with any of these enemies ?
you &apos;re lying ... !
any exchange of words ?
he &apos;s dying !
no , no .
little sparky is dying !
alicia !
you &apos;re killing him !
stop !
ted , you got a minute ?
okay , mrs. florrick ,
we &apos;re just trying to narrow focus .
did he ever say someone was out to kill him ?
you laugh now , mrs. florrick .
i do laugh now .
but one day you &apos;ll be identifying my body in a morgue ,
then you &apos;ll know .
what @-@ what will i know ?
that everything i &apos;ve said is true .
he said that ?
and @-@ and what was he referring to ?
he said that mossad was out to kill him .
one of his ongoing cases was against
chicago p.d. for harassment , correct ?
yes .
can you tell us what he said about that ?
may i make a phone call ?
now ?
yes .
why ?
i need to make a phone call .
alicia ? where are you ?
what ?
who is that ?
it &apos;s alicia .
she says ashbaugh &apos;s dead .
ashbaugh ?
our ashbaugh ?
he was murdered on state street .
ho @-@ hold on , alicia .
hold on .
can you hear us now ?
yes . they want me to talk about our cases
to help them find the killer .
our @-@ our cases with ashbaugh ?
yes .
including the police harassment case .
you worried about attorney @-@ client privilege ?
yes .
are we still bound ,
given our client &apos;s new status ?
uh , the privilege survives death .
with some exceptions .
i don &apos;t think this merits .
with survivor approval ?
okay , we &apos;ll try and contact the surviving family ,
see if they &apos;ll give an allowance .
in the meantime , be circumspect .
you can talk about anything shared outside
the attorney @-@ client relationship , but not covered .
diane ?
do you have a minute , peter needs a word .
i , uh ... sure .
call you back .
nice court attire ?
it impresses the judges .
so , diane , i wanted to thank you
for your debate @-@ prep help .
it was indispensable .
it was fun .
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;ll be a great stand @-@ in for kresteva .
that &apos;s true .
so ... ?
so , you &apos;re aware that justice ludwig
was killed in a car accident two weeks ago ?
yes , we represented his wife .
that &apos;s right . which leaves open a supreme court seat .
which tradition leaves to the governor to fill .
you want me to offer some names ?
no , i want you to offer your name .
i think that &apos;s a positive response .
no , i &apos;m just ...
you ... you want me ...
yes .
to be a supreme court justice ?
yes .
your politics mesh with peter &apos;s .
you know people with money
and your name means something
to the people we want to court ...
more importantly , i think you &apos;d make a damn good judge .
i am bowled over .
great . so , say yes .
i , um ...
i have a business .
yeah , you &apos;ll have to relinquish that .
that is , if i win .
um ... how long do i have to decide ?
till this evening .
tonight ?
well , unfortunately , i &apos;m getting a lot of pressure
from the democratic committee to pick somebody else ,
so i need my candidate tonight .
i understand .
okay .
so , uh ...
that gives me three hours .
two and a half .
so , you know why i &apos;m here .
i can guess .
they &apos;re afraid i &apos;ll fall back
on my attorney @-@ client privilege ,
and you &apos;re here , as my friend ,
to coax me into disclosing ?
yes . and being a lawyer myself ,
i can walk you through
why it &apos;s not attorney @-@ client privilege .
because the client is deceased ?
among other things .
the other things being , you can help find the killer .
seems particularly in the client &apos;s interest .
i talked to my partners ,
and they would like me to be circumspect .
okay . so , did your client ever mention
someone by the name of edward lomax ,
or eddie lomax ?
why ?
we &apos;re looking into a lot of leads .
it &apos;s just one such lead .
eddie lomax ?
you bring up lomax again ,
and i &apos;ll kill you , you hear me ?
unfortunately ,
i ... can &apos;t deny
or confirm any such mention ,
due to attorney @-@ client privilege .
okay .
one more question .
how you doing ?
how am i doing ? good . you ?
good . need a ride back to your party ?
yeah . um , i should probably call my husband
and tell him where i am .
good . and , um ...
maybe we can talk sometime later ?
sure . what about ?
advice . nothing really .
peter . hi .
uh , sorry about that .
no , something with a client .
i &apos;ll be back in a minute .
how &apos;s it going ?
oh , it @-@ it &apos;s going good , i think .
he &apos;s free , he &apos;s free . come on .
oh . a @-@ all right .
eli &apos;s prodding me , i &apos;m gonna have to go .
so i &apos;ll see you when @-@ when you get back .
okay , bye .
god .
all right , all right , all right .
your eminence .
mr. state &apos;s attorney , what an honor .
oh , no , no , no . the honor is mine .
and your lovely wife-- where is she ?
uh , i was just on the phone with her .
she was called away for a moment ,
but she &apos;ll be right back .
yes , i &apos;m sorry for the difficulty .
the ... the difficulty ?
my nephew had the same issues .
but i &apos;m glad you &apos;re facing it head @-@ on .
drug addiction is a ... a difficult thing .
you all set ?
yeah .
are you gonna be okay riding a motorcycle in that ?
you don &apos;t have a motorcycle .
no , but wouldn &apos;t it be great if i did ?
mrs. florrick ?
i need to ...
come with me , please .
we found the car , the killer &apos;s car .
great . so , we &apos;re halfway home .
there &apos;s a problem . car had a gps .
we ran the address the killer entered into it .
okay ?
it was your apartment , mrs. florrick .
hello ?
grace , i ... is , ..... ?
are you all right ?
yeah , sorry , we were just in the other room .
so , everything there is all right ?
is zach with you ?
yeah . why ? are you at the party ?
yes . uh , no .
grace , i need you to do something for me .
you know the vermas on the fourth floor ?
i need the two of you to go there right now .
they &apos;re on vacation .
mom , what &apos;s wrong ?
ugh . okay .
go downstairs to zach &apos;s car , and drive over to grandma &apos;s .
well , grandma &apos;s here .
she &apos;s ... she &apos;s there ? jackie ?
oh , no . your mom .
is that alicia ?
she got us presents .
okay , grace , i need ...
oh , oh , boom .
oh , that &apos;s so bad .
put your grandma on the phone .
she wants to talk to you .
alicia . i just dropped by .
i brought them some more
age @-@ appropriate presents this time .
mom ... i need you to do something for me .
it &apos;s very serious .
i want you to drive the kids
to your hotel , okay ? please ?
now ? you want me to take them now ?
yes .
there &apos;s a situation . there may be danger at my apartment .
the police are on their way ,
but with the parade on state street ...
kids , get your stuff together .
we &apos;re going over to my hotel .
thanks , mom . can you put zach on the phone ?
sure . you have such an exciting life .
zach ?
hey , mom . she &apos;s fine . she &apos;s not causing any trouble .
i know , but i need you to do something for me .
uh , grandma &apos;s not that ...
responsible , and , um ...
but saint patrick &apos;s day , she can be a bit crazy .
she &apos;s all right .
i know .
um , but if she asks you to do something ...
... that doesn &apos;t make sense , you can disobey her .
okay ? i want you to disobey her .
but right now , i want you out of the apartment .
i have to go . i &apos;ll talk to you later .
that your kids ?
everything all right ?
yes .
you know attorney @-@ client privilege may be waived
if the attorney &apos;s life is in danger .
i heard ashbaugh mention ... edward lomax .
you bring up lomax again ,
and i &apos;ll kill you , you hear me ?
or someone mentioned it to him .
an officer nozowitz .
do you think this had anything
to do with your lawsuit against the department for harassment ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i witnessed nozowitz throwing my client ...
against the wall and threatening to
kill him if he ever mentioned
eddie lomax again .
okay , thanks . that &apos;s really helpful .
i &apos;ll be right back .
still no word from ashbaugh &apos;s family .
what was that about ?
what ? what about ?
you and eli and peter .
he , uh ...
he asked me to take the empty seat of justice ludwig .
he ... ? really ?
yes .
yes , but it @-@ it would mean stepping away from the ...
our partnership .
when did you get religious ?
why is that so weird ?
no , it &apos;s not weird .
it &apos;s just unusual for our family .
is it your father ?
is what my father ?
the religion thing .
no , it &apos;s all her .
oh , you know , grace , your father has issues .
it &apos;s always the philanderers who go to jesus .
oh , no ! the car &apos;s blocked !
zach , where &apos;s your car ?
mine &apos;s blocked in , too .
okay . over there .
that &apos;s a bar .
oh , don &apos;t worry . they &apos;ll let you in .
come on . we &apos;ll sit in the bar and wait
until the cars get unblocked .
come . look , i &apos;m not trying to get you drunk .
i &apos;m trying to get you warm .
come on . let &apos;s go .
we &apos;re bringing sergeant nozowitz in for questioning ,
and we &apos;ll get you some security .
thanks .
i &apos;ll wait here with you if you don &apos;t mind .
please .
so , what was the advice ?
before ...
you said you needed some advice ?
oh , no . some other time .
what other time ?
you &apos;re here , i &apos;m here .
and we &apos;re being serenaded .
what do you think of will gardner ?
what do i think ?
yes . he &apos;s not seeing anybody , is he ?
no . i don &apos;t think so . why ?
i don &apos;t know .
sometimes i think he &apos;s pursuing me .
then other times ...
is he reluctant because
we &apos;re on the opposite side of cases , is that it ?
i mean , we &apos;ve faced each other a few times , but not a lot .
i don &apos;t know .
i hate this stuff .
it &apos;s so high school , you know ?
are you sure he &apos;s not seeing someone ?
yes .
does he know that you and i are friends ?
i @-@ i ... i don &apos;t know . why ?
you should ask him out .
ugh . i knew you were gonna say that .
laura , ask him out . seriously .
i think he &apos;d be receptive .
and if you ever need advice from me sometime ...
i &apos;ll yell .
yeah . oh . oh !
the restrooms ?
uh , those doors .
nozowitz .
she said your name--nozowitz .
i barely knew the guy .
you got to be kidding .
she fingered me ? !
uh , she said you got into a fight with him .
he &apos;s better off dead .
he deserved it .
you &apos;re not wearing green .
a pinch to grown an inch .
me ? i &apos;m a massage therapist .
really ?
mm @-@ hmm .
i &apos;m sorry .
yeah .
kalinda , i need your help .
right now ?
if you can .
be right there .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you for joining us ...
so you &apos;re the one spreading the rumors .
oh , i &apos;m the one ?
what rumors are we talking about here , eli ?
zach florrick being arrested on the drugs charge .
uh , ben , can i get a bottle of water ?
i saw mrs. florrick being talked to by two policemen ,
and then , i overheard the detective mention pot
and zach florrick ,
and that &apos;s what i repeated when asked .
that &apos;s a lie .
yeah . what is it with you people calling everyone a liar ?
sometimes the truth doesn &apos;t bend to your will .
sometimes things happen which you wish hadn &apos;t .
it &apos;s such a pointless lie , too .
zach wasn &apos;t arrested .
the facts on the ground will contradict you immediately ,
so ... why ?
just because peter can intimidate the state &apos;s attorney
into not prosecuting does not mean an arrest for pot didn &apos;t happen .
you &apos;re good .
oh . yeah ? you think so ?
peter can &apos;t deny this lie .
why ? because his son was pulled over
by madison county pd who found marijuana shake
in his car , and then ,
peter intimidated the state &apos;s attorney
into dropping the charges ?
you mean , that &apos;s why it &apos;s hard for peter to deny ?
oh , we missed you .
i know . i &apos;ll call you .
this will be a battle to the death .
no . you know why it won &apos;t ?
&apos;cause i got the truth on my side ,
and the truth always wins .
look , kalinda ...
cary , come on , it &apos;s important .
i can &apos;t say anything . it &apos;s confidential .
all i want to know is that
when you were at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
did you investigate sergeant nozowitz ?
i leave lockhart / gardner ,
i can &apos;t use what i know
to benefit the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
when i leave the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
i can &apos;t use it to benefit lockhart / gardner .
yeah .
look , our client , ashbaugh , was murdered .
i heard .
the killer &apos;s vehicle was found ,
and alicia &apos;s address was in the gps .
we investigated nozowitz for corruption .
taking drug money .
i.a.d. was looking into him and they asked us to consult .
okay , and ... and do you know anything
about a man by the name of edward lomax ?
yeah . drug dealer .
he was shot and killed in the fifth ward .
he has nothing to do with nozowitz .
well , nozowitz seemed worried about having his name
associated with this dead drug dealer .
i &apos;d be careful , kalinda .
thanks .
... dance music coming up
a little later in the evening ,
and i hope to see each and every one of you
out on that dance floor .
that &apos;s not good .
no . and that &apos;s the only time
you saw nozowitz with ashbaugh ?
yes .
did ashbaugh ever mention anything to you about corruption ?
no . i mean , the usual stuff .
no , the police connection
to mossad and the unabomber .
all right . and what about the fifth ward murder ,
did he mention anything to you about that ?
um , i got to go .
i &apos;ll call you back .
matthew , you act as if i &apos;m omnipotent .
i can &apos;t get you everything .
i &apos;m just asking for the police report , that &apos;s all .
get your investigator on it .
she &apos;s on a lot of other things .
w @-@ what is the case again ?
a shooting in the fifth ward .
alicia , are you there ? hello ?
yes . yes , i am .
alicia , this is life and death here .
the fifth street ward shooting .
can you have someone look into it ?
yes .
um , matthew , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m going into a meeting .
can i get back to you ?
yes . but get back to me quick .
okay .
everything all right ?
uh , what ? yeah , um ...
what is-- what do you mean ?
no , no , no , you just-- you seemed far away .
we located sergeant nozowitz .
we &apos;re questioning him now .
good . good .
good .
&apos;kay .
why &apos;s he want a police report ?
probably thinks we can use it
in our suit against the chicago pd .
you &apos;re suing the police again ?
will .
you &apos;re the one who gave him to me .
can you see what you can find out ?
about this ward shooting ? what about kalinda ?
she &apos;s busy .
please .
he &apos;s driving me crazy .
what do i get ?
what do you get ?
yeah . what do i get ?
david lee becomes name partner ?
no .
then who ?
ugh . i don &apos;t like talking about this .
why ?
it feels like i &apos;m cheating on you .
you found someone better .
go with gardner &amp; associates .
you don &apos;t need another name partner .
hello .
alicia ?
yeah , still no luck .
what ?
they found my address in his gps .
your ...
i &apos;m coming down .
no . no , will .
no . i &apos;m fine .
i was just wondering if you remember ashbaugh
wanting information about a murder .
i &apos;m coming down .
i &apos;ll see you in 20 minutes .
will , it &apos;s okay .
alicia , you may be the target of a murderer .
i &apos;m coming down .
do you want me to tell peter ?
no , no , no . he &apos;ll want to come , too ,
and he needs to concentrate on tonight .
okay , i &apos;ll see you in a minute
well , i &apos;m gonna go talk to him .
peter , you can &apos;t .
he just lied about zach .
yes , but the problem is ,
it &apos;s a lie with a bad fact .
you intimidated the madison county state &apos;s attorney
on exactly this kind of pot charge .
there is no pot charge !
you know the way to battle a lie ?
with the truth .
no .
with a bigger lie .
peter . eli .
mike .
what ?
what are you doing ?
i have to go to the men &apos;s room .
peter . let it go .
let what go ?
i have to go to the men &apos;s room .
i love irish songs .
i think i &apos;m secretly irish .
oh , you know , they have that genetic test
that tells you what nationalities
are in your background .
i think i &apos;m moroccan , italian and irish .
alicia keep you on a pretty short leash ?
no .
yeah , you go off on a lot of adventures , don &apos;t you ?
i have a boyfriend .
oh , my god .
i didn &apos;t know he was your boyfriend .
since when ?
since he asked me .
that &apos;s not what you said to mom .
you said he wasn &apos;t .
have you kissed ?
yeah .
young men are such great kissers .
they &apos;re so anxious .
it &apos;s like food to them .
you didn &apos;t tell mom you slept with becca .
grace .
what ?
you said i didn &apos;t tell mom .
why is it okay for you and not for me ?
we &apos;re all family here .
have you slept with him ?
no .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
i mean , your mom was pregnant with you
when she got married .
what ?
oh , you mean you didn &apos;t know ?
yeah , she was two months pregnant .
she was not . the date was two months after .
no , they changed the date .
i remember when she called your grandfather .
&quot; oh , daddy , daddy , what are we gonna do ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; do you love him ? &quot;
your mother was very adventurous when she was your age .
she liked the bad boys .
peter .
mike .
how &apos;s your son ?
eli tells me you &apos;re worried
about what i &apos;m saying .
are you worried about what i &apos;m saying ?
no . no , i &apos;m not worried .
i mean , i think you &apos;ll say
whatever helps you .
i think you &apos;ll say whatever you want reality to be .
but you &apos;re not provoked .
is that what you &apos;re trying to do , is to provoke me ?
nah , it just seems that
people have their limits .
either their wives , kids or moms .
in your case , maybe all three .
am i being funny ?
no , i was just remembering that eli said
the way to battle a lie is to make a bigger lie .
oh , and you disagree .
no .
you know the way to battle a lie ?
no , but i have a feeling you &apos;re gonna ...
are you crazy ?
actually , this is the one moment i &apos;m not .
you can &apos;t hit me .
you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re right , so i must not have .
you just did .
are you sure ?
it makes no sense for me to hit you .
my nose is bleeding .
i &apos;m on the floor , my nose is bleeding !
yeah , i can see that .
but there must be some other reason for it .
no , no , no ...
i &apos;ll @-@ i &apos;ll sue you .
good idea .
i &apos;ll see you outside .
gentlemen , would you go up and see
if mr. kresteva is all right ?
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s had too much to drink and he fell down .
yes , sir .
that &apos;s a cheshire smile .
no , that &apos;s a real smile .
it &apos;s james bond .
alicia , are you all right ?
yes . you didn &apos;t need to come down here .
i know . what are they saying ?
the police ?
nothing to me .
but i think it has something to do
with the murder in the fifth ward .
i looked into it .
the cops never found the shooter .
it was a drug theft .
eight pounds of coke missing .
how was the party ?
loads of fun .
you look good .
i do ?
thanks .

yeah ? checking for connections to nozowitz ?
kalinda , you know there &apos;s no connection .
you &apos;re protecting your detective .
no . you defense attorneys think he &apos;s wearing a badge ,
he must be guilty .
but nozowitz was working undercover
for the d.e.a. at the time .
he &apos;s innocent , kalinda .

whose idea was it to lie about alicia being a target ?
whoa , whoa . where you going ?

of course i &apos;d do whatever i could to get information from you .
yep . everyone &apos;s doing their job .

not great . look at this .
look at this . do you believe this ?
oh , you &apos;ll be fine .
it @-@ it ... it happens to the best of us .
what happens to the best of us ?
a little tipple . a little spill .
it &apos;s saint patrick &apos;s day .
it &apos;s forgivable .
your eminence , peter florrick hit me .
what ? no .
he wants you to think that i was drinking and fell down ,
but it was his drink ! he put it there !
he wanted it to look like mine .
no , i know , i know .
you take care now , mike .
mrs. florrick . alicia .
hello . you &apos;re the one person i haven &apos;t spent a second with .
your eminence .
ah , the formal greeting .
well , i had to look it up online .
so , either your son has been arrested for smoking marijuana
or the police needed your help with a murder .
the latter . uh , i don &apos;t know who told you about the former
but definitely the latter .
yes , that &apos;s what your mother said .
my ... my mother ?
yes , veronica .
she was here , somewhere .
just to be clear , your eminence ,
she likes saying things for their shock value .
oh , i know .
it was so nice to meet you , mrs. florrick .
what was that ? what did he say ?
nothing . everything &apos;s good .
peter hit kresteva .
what ?
peter hit kresteva ,
but everybody thinks he fell down , so play along .
peter fell down ?
no , no , kresteva fell down .
from drinking . he has a bloody nose .
are you serious ?
did you see it ?
the punch ? no .
but i heard it was epic .
make yourself comfortable .
yeah .
yeah .
look .
nozowitz is a tough cop but an honest one ,
and this crap about him being tied to the killing ...
shut up .
you convinced me .
i ...
what ? how &apos;d i do that ?
our client sued a lot of people .
he made a lot of people angry .
okay .
see there ? that object ?
yeah . what is it ?
you ever heard of fetch @-@ far ?
it &apos;s something that dog owners use to fling tennis balls
so their dogs can chase it .
okay .
well , one of the people our client sued was a dog lover .
his dog was barking a lot .
are you kidding ? you @-@ you think this is about a dog barking ?
have you ever met a dog lover ?
mom .
grace .
where &apos;s grandma ?
i don &apos;t know .
she was talking with some guy .
i was pregnant ... when we got married .
and we were embar ...
no . i was embarrassed ,
so i changed the date of our wedding .
and me ?
you were not an accident .
we wanted you .
because ... you thought i &apos;d keep you together ?
no , grace .
but we &apos;re the reason why you &apos;re ...
not with who you want to be .
i don &apos;t want to be the reason that you had to be responsible .
grace , listen to me .
this isn &apos;t about responsibility .
this is about ... love .
i loved you before you were born .
and i loved zach before he was born .
and i love you even more now .
and dad ?
i love him .
peter .
your eminence .
oh . there you are .
hi , mom .
zach and i were looking all over for you .
how &apos;d it go ?
good . i &apos;m going to talk to your grandmother for a minute .
i &apos;ll be right back .
no uh @-@ oh . i just want to talk .
see you later kids .
mom .
no . no , no , no . it &apos;s not what you think .
we had an adventure .
i mean , they are such great kids .
they &apos;re so funny . they made me laugh .
though i do think you might be protecting them too much .
that &apos;s up to me .
no one is saying it isn &apos;t .
at least you can let me give you just a modicum of advice .
they need to be treated the way i treated you .
i know you don &apos;t want me to see them , but i have to see them .
and whatever you say , whatever you do ,
i &apos;m gonna see them .
even if i have to sneak into their schools ,
i &apos;m gonna see them .
mom .
maybe i &apos;m getting senile ...
but i like them .
they remind me of your father .
i know .
okay , i was going to rip into you , mom , but ...
we &apos;re talking tomorrow because ...
you can &apos;t use the truth to undercut me with my kids .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
good .
there you are .
oh , i had to step away .
peter .
hi , veronica .
would you like to dance ?
i would .
you know , this is just like our wedding .
so , no cardinal &apos;s hug ?
no .
i &apos;m so sorry .
look , if life is about getting a hug ,
then i &apos;m in the wrong business .
thank you , by the way .
for what ?
punching kresteva .
oh . no , i @-@ i ... i couldn &apos;t have punched kresteva .
it wouldn &apos;t make sense for me to punch kresteva ,
so i must not have .
he shook kresteva &apos;s hand , too .
what ?
he didn &apos;t make a choice .
he didn &apos;t hug either of you .
first time ever . we are in ...
uncharted territory here .
oh . well , good . good .
well , you &apos;re both taking this very casually .
eli , i &apos;m dancing with my wife now .
okay , i &apos;ll go worry about the campaign ;
you ... dance .
why not settle ?
why are you making so many enemies ?
this is for you .
what is it ?
bach . i thought you &apos;d enjoy it at home .
thanks .
let &apos;s settle .
okay , matthew ?
it &apos;s just a dog barking .
you don &apos;t need the money .
i &apos;ve never needed the money .
it was always about the process .
what process ?
being with you .
matthew ...
that was a joke .
are you sure ?
yeah ,
i &apos;m sure .
suing because i liked being with you ...
wouldn &apos;t make sense .
okay .
i &apos;ll be right back .
are you all right ?
just a memory .
of what ?
nothing .
