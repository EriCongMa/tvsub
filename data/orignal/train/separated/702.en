This is all you ever wanted --
this lifestyle, this house.
I wish you'd give me a chance to explain.
Why would I give you anything, Emily?
You guys want a bump?
Miss, step back and put your hands on your head, please.
She's family.
Fine.
I wonder what Gideon wants with her,
as if squeezing her brother out of Lemarchal wasn't enough.
Daniel stepped down of his own volition.
I am curious what Daniel would say
if you asked him about the redhead.
I'd been partying with this girl,
and when I woke up, I found her O.D.'d.
Gideon took a photo of her and used it to blackmail me.
How did you get out?
With a little help from my friends.
Fire!
Welcome back.
Going somewhere?
Southampton.
I got some unfinished business.
You're awake.
David?
I'm sorry I frightened you.
When I saw you outside the manor last night,
I -- I had to get to you.
Oh, David.
It's you.
I can't.
Not until I know the truth.
The truth?
I told myself that Conrad was the mastermind...
and that you were as much a victim as I was.
I just need to hear that from you.
David, I loved you.
Then tell me the truth.
I shouldn't have come. This was a mistake.
Goodbye, Vee.
It's true.
David, I was scared.
I didn't have a choice.
I've regretted that moment ever since.
Oh, David.
Oh, David.
You assured me that an escape would be impossible.
If you don't erase every trace of Victoria's stay
at your facility, Dr. Miller,
then I can assure you
that the feds will be the least of your worries.
Take care of it.
Wrong number?
I'm actually impressed that Victoria got out.
At least now if she goes to the authorities,
there will be no record of her at Claremont.
I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?
Because all I could hear was the sound
of my revenge-free summer be strangled to death
by a web of thorns.
I need you to help me find her.
Ems, we talked about this. I'm not gonna be your enabler.
This isn't just about me, Nolan.
It's about Aiden and every other terrible thing victoria has done.
Track her down.
I can't. No. Really.
Ems, I already tried.
She took a car service
from the loony bin to your front stoop for the bitch-off,
and then she disappeared.
Well, so, keep looking. She's got to be somewhere.
Well, let's say I find Victoria.
Then what?
You've done everything short of killing her.
If Victoria told anyone that you locked her up
and then they find her dead, you're the prime suspect.
Well, then we have to make sure she hasn't.
Can you track Charlotte and Daniel down?
The two people that hate you almost as much as Victoria?
Of course. I'm sure they'll be delighted to see you.
I don't like being on the defensive.
Then find her, and I'll end this for good.
39.
Never knew Maseratis could go under the speed limit.
Come on. These people have no idea what they're driving.
They just buy whatever's got the biggest price tag.
You know how your friends are.
Yeah, well, trust me. They're not all my friends.
Well, Emily Thorne is.
She just bought the biggest house in Southampton
Without so much as a boyfriend to live there with her.
I'm sure she has her reasons.
Reasons for buying the house
or why she doesn't have a boyfriend?
So, how do you know her, again?
She, uh -- she was friends with my wife.
Amanda Clarke, right?
Sorry, man, I mean, it never came up.
I just -- I didn't know. - It's okay.
Believe it or not, um, she and Emily met in juvie.
Emily is an ex-con? Man.
This girl is full of surprises.
Not really.
Oh, come on. Don't be so shy, Porter.
I knew my last partner's passwords and PIN number.
Just comes with the territory
when you're trusting somebody with your life.
So, what is her story?
It's gonna have to wait. Light 'em up.
The meeting is set. Is he still there?
For now. I'm working on it.
Well, work harder.
Hey. You came to me with this.
You want my help, you're gonna have to trust me.
Once we're done,
Gideon will be out of your company
and Charlotte's life...
Permanently.
You're a good brother, Daniel.
Consider yours officially delayed.
Help! Help me!
Please help me! Help! Help!
I've waited too long for this.
There's no way that I'm gonna lose you again.
You have no power over me!
Oh, I have the power.
And my secrets are gonna rot inside of you
beyond your last breath,
because you are gonna keep
your stupid and thankless mouth shut!
Bitch had a camera on her and didn't even know it?
I cannot believe you are dating this idiot.
I know.
Not as hot as you, of course.
Clearly,
or you wouldn't be texting me every minute she's not around.
She's like a cash machine for my blow.
Are you kidding me?!
You've been using me and sleeping with her?!
C-charlotte, we -- we were just --
Save it!
I thought you cared.
Of course I do, babe, but...
I mean, we partied. I-I-I gave you some advice.
I was never your boyfriend.
She's even more pathetic than I thought.
Charlotte! Babe!
Just about to hop in an elevator, so I might lose you.
What's up?
I just caught the guy I was seeing cheating on me.
Who? Gideon?
You know?
You show up to parties with him.
I'm gonna hear even if you don't tell me.
I say good riddance.
Thank you for your support.
Speaking of...
I got a call from your landlord, said your rent's late.
What happened to that check I wrote you?
Daniel, I -- I'm so sorry.
What did you do?
I cashed it.
Let me guess -- to party with Gideon.
I made a mistake.
Daniel, things have been really hard lately.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do you have any idea what I went through to get that money?!
I can't help you right now.
Daniel, wait!
What the hell are you doing here?
Just scoping out the place for a friend who's coming to town.
Friend?
I didn't think you had any.
I can't imagine you made any
at that disastrous party you threw at my old house.
Just trying to keep up Grayson tradition.
There are no Grayson traditions
because there's no Grayson family left.
Well, I heard your mother's back in town.
Well, you heard wrong.
You know, it's just sick
how you two live to destroy each other.
I suggest you follow her lead and disappear.
Where are you taking me?
Keep going.
This is not a dream, Victoria.
But you were murdered.
I've seen your grave.
This is my grave.
I learned that Corpnews C.E.O. Jerry Thomas
is planning to retire.
This is the perfect opportunity for us to absorb the news giant.
Have you forgotten how many times your father tried and failed?
I am not my father, Francois.
And if my recent track record has not convinced you,
I assure you acquiring Corpnews will.
I will be lunching with Jerry this afternoon.
Without Gideon? He's head of acquisitions.
Well, his absence here today
speaks to his overall lack of reliability.
I will not leave this deal in the hands of...
My very capable hands. Not to worry, Francois.
I will be taking this lunch alone,
and I guarantee delivery of Corpnews.
What are the odds of getting four flat tires?
You don't even have the courtesy to make up a good excuse.
This isn't primary school, Gideon.
No, it is not.
Back then, dad could have cared less about his silly little daughter.
He promised his legacy to his son.
And yet, he chose me.
And the board will correct his mistake once I deliver Corpnews.
Nice try.
Last one.
Oh, my muse.
I couldn't have done this without you, girl.
You know better than to disturb a genius at work.
Well, genius,
Charlotte's not where your tracking device says she is.
I'm at the hotel and I don't see her.
Well, I'm sure it's just human error.
Ems, check under your Manolos.
You're right on top of each other.
I am telling you, nolan. She is not...
Oh, my God.
Charlotte!
Go away! Don't come any closer!
You don't want to do this.
You don't know what I want!
Or care.
That's not true, Charlotte.
Then where were you before now?!
I've been trying. I'll try harder.
This isn't about you!
Why don't you just leave me alone like everyone else has?!
Just please let me explain.
We can talk this through. I promise.
I'm begging you, Charlotte. Please don't do this.
Oh, God.
Jumper's been apprehended. Situation's under control.
Come on. You're all right.
So this is where you've been?
I'll handle the questions.
You owe me some answers.
I've had 20 years to piece together
the conspiracy that destroyed my life.
But I still have one unanswered question.
Did you betray me?
David, the night I lost you,
my heart broke and it never mended.
When I found out what Conrad had done,
I went straight to the D.A. to testify,
but Conrad intercepted me.
For years...
he kept me in silence by threatening my children.
Our child.
I had no choice, so I became the good wife...
until I couldn't stand it anymore.
You were always the love of my life, David.
Always.
No. No.
I'm not gonna hurt you. I believe you.
I still love you, Vee.
I always have.
You see, this is why we don't give people a pass.
I can't believe Charlotte almost...
Well, she didn't. All right? She's gonna be fine, man.
Most of the jumpers that I've seen,
they're just doing it to try to get attention.
What if this is worse than that?
That's for the psychiatrist to decide.
You better get that checked out.
You landed pretty hard on that shoulder.
No, I'm fine.
I thought you said we don't give people a pass.
Come on. While you're getting a clean bill
of health from the medics,
I'll check on Charlotte at the hospital.
Deal. Meet me back at the station.
I'll catch a ride on the rig.
She's lucky that you were here.
What were you doing here?
Did she call you?
No, I-I was just visiting a friend.
It was a coincidence.
That's some coincidence.
Especially considering from the small part
of the conversation that I heard,
you two seem to have quite a history.
So, who were you meeting?
Your friend?
Look, I almost lost someone really important to me up there,
so...
No, of course. I understand.
But whatever's going on with you two,
I'm sure you'll get past it.
She owes you her life.
Well, actually, she owes you.
Thank you. Excuse me.
I'm here to meet Jerry Thomas.
Of course, Mr. Lemarchal.
Let me see if he's ready for you.
Stay the hell away from my sister.
Did Charlotte call her big brother to come beat me up?
That's pretty pathetic, Daniel.
Let go, or I'll have that picture
of you and the dead redhead
on every news blog in seconds.
Screw you.
I'll give you a call
when your sister O.D.'s.
Daniel Grayson.
Miles Vanburen from the ledger.
Thanks for the invite.
Miles. Glad you could make it.
How about a drink?
I'm having deja vu.
All I'm missing is the blindfold.
You have to stop doing this.
You're driving yourself crazy.
Oh, right, it's my fault you put me through hell.
The shrink told you to take me home?
No. What the doctor said is you need to be with family
who can help you through this.
Let go of me!
I don't want to be here with her or you!
Charlotte. Charlotte. Charlotte. Please. Please.
Look, I know that you don't trust me anymore,
but I am not lying to you when I say
she's the only person in the world
you need to be listening to right now.
The doctor was right.
You should be with family right now.
Thanks. I'll do that.
I'm the one who kidnapped you, Charlotte.
I can't stand seeing you like this.
I know I did the wrong thing,
but you have to believe I did it for all the right reasons.
What are you saying?
I'm your sister, Charlotte.
I'm Amanda.
I'm sorry that I scared you.
Prison taught me that only when people are truly afraid
can you see who they really are.
Believing that you are innocent is all that kept me alive.
How are you alive?
The world thought that you were stabbed 10 years ago.
I was.
They rushed me to the infirmary.
I blacked out from the pain.
And then, when I came to, I was out.
Where were you?
Were you in here?
I'm sorry.
The less you know, the better, for now.
It's for your own safety
and the safety of our daughter.
I need to protect Charlotte.
I wasn't able to do that for Amanda.
And now she's gone.
You heard.
What happened on that boat was a terrible tragedy.
I can't lose anyone else.
I want to be in charlotte's life, and in yours.
S-say something.
It's...
it's been years.
And a lot's happened.
I thought you were dead.
And then you kidnap me and bring me here
without explaining where you've been,
and you say you want to pick up where we left off, and...
I know it's a lot,
but we can get through it, right?
You don't want an honest answer.
If you did, you would get me out of here
instead of making me your prisoner.
Prisoner?
Okay. Fine. Let's go.
You know, I'd be lying if I said I didn't expect
Lemarchal to crumble after your father's death,
but your sister seems to have stabilized the company
in only six months.
You should know my sister's just a pretty face.
I'm the one that's making the deals
and bringing up the numbers.
Not paying his suppliers.
I'd avoid business with this one, if I were you.
He owes me big.
I-I don't --
Don't play dumb with me, Gid!
I know what you took from me.
You care to explain this?
I-I swear to you, I don't know what she's doing.
Taking back what's mine.
This meeting is over.
I'm being set up. Jerry --
Jerry, you -- you got to believe me.
You know, I hate to leave an unfinished drink, but...
Miles, I understand.
Duty calls.
Yeah, it's Miles. Yeah, I got something big.
All this time, why didn't you tell me?
Believe me, I wanted to.
Every part of me wanted to, but...
I had to protect you,
and I think...
that after everything I'd done,
part of me felt like I didn't deserve you.
But then I saw you today, and I recognized that pain.
After I was taken away...
I went from
shuffling around foster care...
to living on the streets...
to juvie.
I was so alone.
And at a certain point, I --
I could only see one way out.
I know what you're feeling, Charlotte.
But there is always another way to deal with this,
a better way.
Our father gave this to me.
It has --
The journals.
They gave me the strength to survive.
Hopefully they'll do the same for you,
and maybe you'll understand why I did the things that I did.
You spent three years fighting for a family
that was right in front of you.
And instead of embracing me, you used me and lied to me?
Charlotte --
Do you hear yourself? You chose revenge over me.
I didn't think I had the choice.
Well, you did.
And you can't take it back.
You think you're gonna make
some big, emotional plea, hoping that I'll, what,
forgive you for all the terrible things you've done to me?
Over what's in this?!
I came looking for you when my name was cleared.
Someone had, uh, moved into your house.
Where were you?
Well, I couldn't stand being there.
Every room held a memory of Conrad.
Well, memories get fuzzy.
I never remember you ordering steak and eggs before.
A lot's changed, David.
How are you two over here?
Is everything okay with your order, hon?
Did you drop your steak knife?
No, it's okay.
You got it?
Good.
You're still scared. Even here, you don't trust me.
I haven't really given you a reason to.
I got a second chance,
and all I've done is accuse you of unspeakable things.
And I've done some unspeakable things of my own.
David, what have you done?
I killed Conrad.
I saw his confession.
I heard the vile things he said to our daughter.
I couldn't let him keep on herting you.
And I knew he'd drag you down with him.
I did it for you, Victoria.
I...
I would do anything for you.
Anything.
Thank you.
You know, when my father used to say goodbye to me,
whether he was going to work or tucking me in,
he would always say,
"Know how much I love you?"
Infinity times infinity.
Used to say it every day. Twice a day.
After a while, I'd say it without thinking,
without realizing what it really meant.
Charlotte was right.
I chose revenge over her.
You didn't choose revenge, Ems.
You chose your father.
But he's gone, Nolan.
I did it all for a dead man.
He's never gonna know.
And Charlotte...
She'll never understand.
She'll never forgive me.
Wake up.
You cannot control the way Charlotte feels,
just the same way you can't control how Jack felt
when you told him.
And, I mean, look at you two now.
Maybe stronger than you ever were.
Charlotte will come around.
It's too late.
It's never too late.
She just...Charlotte needs time.
Maybe a very long time, but...
Or not.
Charlotte?
I'm speechless.
You do remember they have the internet in Paris, right?
The board is going to flip.
Give it a rest.
You and Daniel planned this whole thing.
What are you talking about?
Daniel told you about the redhead, didn't he?
You killed her.
And I'm gonna need a damn good reason
not to do the same to you and your partner.
Daniel is not my partner.
Whatever he did to you, he did on his own.
You're lying!
No. And I'll prove it.
Yes, it's Margaux Lemarchal for Jerry.
No, it's urgent. Thanks.
Jerry. I'm so sorry, um...
No, I assure you,
everything that occurred was an act of sabotage
by Daniel Grayson.
I would hate for you to dismiss my brother
because of the actions of a disgruntled ex-employee.
Yes. I understand. Thank you.
So, he has agreed to a second meeting,
but he just boarded a plane to London
to meet with another company.
I'll get you on the first flight out in the morning.
No.
You'll get me out there tonight.
Well, I need a drink. How about you?
I wish I could.
I got to tuck Carl in
and then I got to work on the Stowaway because, uh,
the wiring's a mess, and I can't open till its fixed.
Is there anything I can give you a hand with?
I mean, I don't know anything about electricity,
but I've taken my share of taser shots in training.
Thanks, man, but you just, uh...rest that shoulder.
Speaking of, any word on your sister-in-law?
I think she's gonna be okay.
Thanks for grabbing her.
All in a day's work.
Besides, it never hurts to look like a hero
in front of a beautiful woman.
Emily?
Yeah.
Yeah, she's...she's interesting.
Listen, Emily is, uh... She's gone through a lot.
She lost her fiance a few months back,
so now is not the time to start anything.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.
Thanks for asking me.
I'm glad you're ready to...
I can't do this with you.
I mean, I just... I have so much I want to say,
but I...I can't without losing my temper.
So I wrote it down.
Why do I have to fly commercial?
What about our jet?
Not an option.
By the time it will be ready, you will be landing in Heathrow.
Now, the car service will take you directly to your meeting with Jerry.
I would like to see Daniel try and interrupt this one.
Why are you doing this?
I told you once the deal was done
I was gonna use it to take your job.
I'm just doing what dad would do...
Putting the deal first.
We can fight out the rest when you return.
Well, if that's the case,
enjoy your final days in my office.
Boarding pass, please? Passport?
Have a nice flight.
Get that mutt away from me.
Get it away. Come on.
Sir, I'm gonna need to see your bag, if you don't mind.
I do mind. I got a flight to catch.
Sir, has your bag been out of your possession at all
since arriving at the airport?
No.
Hey, hey. What are you doing?
Take it easy, man!
That's not mine.
You're under arrest.
That's not mine.
You have the right to remain silent.
It's not mine. Hey.
Anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
Get off me, man. Get off me!
You have the right to an attorney.
Get off me!
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you.
Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you?
Au revoir, mon frere.
You wouldn't believe what I just heard on the news.
Gideon got arrested for trying to smuggle drugs on a plane.
That was an impressive move.
I had to act fast.
Gideon confessed to killing that poor girl
and threatened to do the same to us.
So you got rid of him first.
I didn't have a choice.
With that article out, there's no way
my brother will be able to talk himself out of this.
Gideon is going to prison.
Although, for what he's done, he deserves much worse.
Didn't think you had it in you.
You underestimate me.
And you misinterpreted that as a compliment.
Still trying to protect my soul.
It's not evil inside us, Daniel.
It's justice.
That's where our power comes from.
If we ignore it, we lose it.
I think it's time to embrace that power
and stop fighting our impulses.
Where are we going now?
I was, uh, hoping that I could finally meet my daughter.
I know it will be hard on her,
but you'll be there to help her through it.
David.
There's something I need to tell you.
Is it Charlotte? Is she all right?
When you asked me where I'd been after I left Grayson Manor
the truth is that I was locked up against my will.
It was Conrad?
No. Someone just as hateful.
Because of her,
my relationship with Charlotte is in ruins.
My life is in shambles.
I cannot entertain a future with you
until she's been stopped.
I can help.
No, David. You've already done enough.
Tell me who it is.
Her name is Emily Thorne.
Goodbye, sis.
Are you all right? Is anyone else in there?
