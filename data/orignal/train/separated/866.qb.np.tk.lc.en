every kid has that one movie to define their childhood .
mine was the &quot; the goonies . &quot;
it has treasure hunting , pirate , kids on adventure ,
and cool gadget build by date .
i lived &quot; goonies . &quot; i breathed &quot; goonies . &quot;
i even did the truffle shuffle ,
a dance made famous by chunk , the lovable fat kid .
mom !
is it silly dance time ?
it &apos;s truffle shuffle .
you &apos;re ruining my moive .
i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m making it better .
she wasn &apos;t .
i was obsessed .
i wanted to live out every scene .
down here it &apos;s our time .
it &apos;s our time down here !
all right , beat it , butthole . i rented &quot; weird science . &quot;
no ! stop ! it &apos;s not over yet .
let me tell you how it ends .
i punch you in the chest , you cry , roll end credits .
adam ! what the hell ?
did you take my hair dryer ?
relax .
i think you &apos;re gonna be delighted
when you see what i &apos;ve done with it .
it &apos;s a goonie gadget .
neat .
let &apos;s see how this thing works .
works well .
you owe me a hair dryer , you putz .
great news .
there &apos;s a horrible smell coming from the attic ,
and your mom wants me to figure out what it is .
how is that great news ?
i got the brilliant idea to dump it off on you morons .
i &apos;m 80 % sure something &apos;s dead up there .
go make some memories .
i &apos;ll be there in a sec .
i &apos;m just about to watch the good part .
which is all of it .
you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
&quot; how do toasters work &quot; ?
what ? no . i have an idea .
every time i went up into my attic ,
i wished i &apos;d find a treasure map ,
just like in my favorite scene from &quot; goonies . &quot;
unfortunately for me ,
i &apos;d mentioned that to erica and barry .
i didn &apos;t know mom and dad had this much crap up here .
barry , when you drop something , pick it up .
what the ?
it &apos;s an old map of jenkintown .
oh , that thing ?
mom bought that when the historical society shut down .
oh , my god . it &apos;s signed by william penn .
why would the founder of pennsylvania
sign a map of our town ?
because he died in this very neighborhood .
yeah , and they never found his fortune . who cares ?
come on . we have an attic to clean .
there &apos;s an &quot; x &quot; on this map , right in our own neighborhood .
an &quot; x &quot; ? what does an &quot; x &quot; mark ?
the spot .
guys , there &apos;s treasure in this town ,
and we &apos;re gonna find it .
come on ! follow me !
i don &apos;t hear you running after me !
we should be running as a group .
you know , i like it when we work together as a team
to torture and humiliate our little brother .
yeah . we should do more mean projects together .
it was february 22 , 1980 @-@ something ,
and the day began like most others for my grandpa .
good morning , house of waffles ! belgian beauties on me !
yep , breakfast for everyone ,
but that &apos;s just who he was .
pops &apos; generosity knew no boundaries .
hey , albert . nice shirt .
you want it ? it &apos;s yours .
no , no , i @-@ i don &apos;t want the shirt .
take it . take the shirt .
all i said was the shirt was nice .
that was the thing about pops .
he &apos;d literally give you the shirt off his back ,
and we &apos;d try not to take advantage of him ,
most of the time .
big news , everybody .
it &apos;s my half @-@ birthday in two months .
your half @-@ birthday ?
and you &apos;ve just been sitting on that ?
no , stop .
there is no such thing as a half @-@ birthday .
dad , take the money back .
mom , leave him alone .
a handsome 60 @-@ year @-@ old man
has the right to do whatever he wants .
you think i &apos;m 60 ? get over here .
and stop giving cash to the kids
every time they lie to you about your age .
bevy , leave the man alone .
he &apos;s doing damn good for a 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
this guy !
while pops was giving away his fortune ,
i &apos;d gathered my best friends to find some of our own .
what &apos;s going on ? what are you nimrods up to ?
good , you &apos;re here . now the treasure hunt can begin .
here are the costumes to the characters you &apos;ll be assigned .
i , of course , will be mikey , leader of the goonies .
that was both in reference to my character ,
also to help my seasonal allergies .
okay , let &apos;s keep this moving .
i &apos;ve got some normal people to see later .
erica , you &apos;ll be stef , the unpleasant crab fisherman .
dana , you &apos;ll be andy , the cute cheerleader .
aww , that &apos;s sweet .
get a room .
and for obvious reasons ,
emmy mirsky , you &apos;ll be mouth .
i know you &apos;re a girl , but i think of you like a dude .
and i think of you like a girl .
okay ! really digging this outfit .
tell me more about this clearly awesome badass .
you &apos;re my big brother . that makes you brand .
got it -- i &apos;m burt , the handsome surfer
who solves crimes at night , eh ?
close enough .
chad kremp , you &apos;ll play chunk .
stuff this pillow under your shirt
and munch on this baby ruth .
um , can this be a granola bar ?
my mom won &apos;t let me eat chocolate .
oh , chunk . classic comic sidekick .
are we a team or what ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , stop .
question -- which goonie am i ?
oh , yeah , dave kim .
good question . who &apos;s left ?
let &apos;s see .
tough call .
well , brand is taken , so ...
you wanted me to be data .
what ? no .
i just invited all of my closest friends over to hang out .
you &apos;ve literally never invited me over before .
so you don &apos;t think we &apos;re friends .
that really stings , dave kim -- really stings .
but since you &apos;re here , you might as well wear
this elaborate gadget and trench coat .
or i &apos;ll be mikey .
you want to be mikey ? be mikey .
then i &apos;m mikey .
you can &apos;t be mikey ! just put on the coat !
all right , goonies ,
who &apos;s ready for the adventure of a lifetime ?
this is it . i can feel it .
some treasure hunt -- biking 10 feet across the street .
you &apos;re wrong , dave kim .
this is quite an adventure .
according to this map , this is the spot .
okay , we got to look for anything out of the ordinary .
look ! that &apos;s a weird knot in the tree .
seems strange .
like i said , this is quite an adventure .
i told you this was real .
you guys ready ?
&apos;cause once i open this ... everything changes .
it &apos;s a note .
it says ...
adam goldberg is a giant nerd ! &quot;
say &quot; cheese . &quot;
it &apos;s true . you &apos;re such a nerd .
i hate you guys !
adam , come on .
it &apos;s not like we invited all of your friends .
but that did make it extra hilarious .
go ahead , yuck it up .
starting now , i don &apos;t have a brother and sister .
you &apos;re both dead to me .
we should go .
nobody tell my mom about the chocolate .
shut up , chunk .
thanks , adam .
this was fun ... until the sad , embarrassing part .
bye , adam . see ya .
while my siblings were busy ruining my life ,
pops was living the high life .
so , what do you want to drink ?
red or white ?
a martini . a little dirty .
i was hoping you &apos;d say that .
hello !
what ?
d @-@ did you break into my place ?
no , i had a key made ...
which didn &apos;t work because you changed the locks ,
so i had to crawl in through the window , so yes .
who &apos;s this ?
this is my daughter , who was just leaving .
sorry . i &apos;m not really interested in dating someone with kids .
miriam , i swear she &apos;s on her way out .
i had no idea how this -- - bye @-@ bye .
bye .
nice job . she was a sure thing .
do you know how long --
dad , we need to talk . your finances are a mess .
oh , please .
you &apos;re late paying your bills ,
you &apos;ve been forgetting to cash your checks ,
and you &apos;ve made some very questionable investments .
i believe in that alpaca farm .
the alpaca is the dog of the future .
dad , i &apos;ve got to take over your finances .
the hell you are .
it says here you closed
your safety deposit box five years ago .
i had a key . they had a key . it was crazy .
so where &apos;s mom &apos;s good jewelry ? it was all in there .
i gave it to you .
no , you didn &apos;t .
i clearly remember handing it directly to you .
you had a colorful sweater and big hair ,
and you were on your way
to tell somebody how to run their life .
okay , now you &apos;re just describing me on any given day .
so you remember it , too .
fine . you want me to ransack my house from top to bottom ?
i will .
but when i don &apos;t find that jewelry , i &apos;m calling the shots .
how dare you ?
i &apos;m very responsible with my money .
you &apos;re using $ 10 bills as coasters .
i ran out of fives .
meanwhile , it had been a week
since i spoke to my brother and sister ,
and it was finally starting to get to them .
hey , pal . you &apos;re looking good , strong .
what &apos;s that i hear , the wind ?
come on , adam .
what do we got to do to stop being dead to you already ?
you can start with an apology .
okay , fine . we feel really bad .
for real , we &apos;re sorry .
i don &apos;t accept .
you can &apos;t do that !
i just did .
take the sorry .
i reject the sorry !
you asked for the sorry !
i asked for it so i could reject it .
you take the damn sorry ! take it now ! take it !
i take nothing !
he &apos;s not taking it .
so you &apos;re just gonna disown us ? unreal .
it &apos;s just a stupid , stupid movie .
not to me . that movie is everything to me .
and you used it to embarrass me
in front of all my friends and dave kim !
okay , we got caught up in the excitement
of crushing your little spirit .
but we &apos;ll figure out a way to even the score .
trust me , i &apos;m way ahead of you .
erica slater , that &apos;s gonna be my name
erica slater , unless you think it &apos;s lame
then we &apos;ll change your name to christian go @-@ o @-@ ldberg
adam ! god ! get out !
what did you do ? !
you embarrassed me in front of my friends ,
so i sent this out to a few select people
so you &apos;ll know what it feels like .
no !
yes !
no !
yes !
that sucks , girl .
so we &apos;re good ?
we sure are . i sent out a little workout video of you .
so ? i look good when i work out .
with mom .
that happened one time !
the one time i was filming it .
dead ! you &apos;re dead to me !
doesn &apos;t matter , &apos; cause you &apos;re already dead to me !
well , you &apos;re really dead to me !
well , then that &apos;s settled .
we &apos;re all dead to each other .
why would christian slater
change his last name to goldberg ?
the search for my grandmother &apos;s missing jewels had begun .
and when beverly goldberg is on the hunt ,
it &apos;s best to steer clear .
okay , dad , i &apos;ve looked everywhere down here .
no jewelry .
now i &apos;m heading upstairs
to start tearing apart the rest of the house ,
unless you want to tell me something .
i want to tell you good luck .
i &apos;m rooting for you , princess .
unbelievable .
albert , this is madness . she &apos;s killing both of us here .
how are you getting killed ?
she &apos;s going through every nook and cranny of this house .
she already found my stash of cuban cigars .
she found my secret tin of multi @-@ flavored popcorn --
caramel , yellow cheese , white cheese .
ooh , i like the white cheese .
we all do .
albert , you &apos;re not going to win ,
so let &apos;s end this and get your finances in order .
let me help you .
here . i even made you a budget .
this is a cruel joke , right ?
$ 200 a month for clothes ? are you nuts ?
it &apos;s more than enough .
i wear silk . it costs me a fortune .
little worms make it . little worms make my clothes .
well , then don &apos;t wear silk .
you &apos;re lucky i don &apos;t punch you in the face right now .
fine , $ 300 for clothes ,
but it &apos;s coming out of your food budget .
no way . it &apos;s already unreasonably low .
how can i buy waffles for an entire restaurant on $ 400 ?
you can &apos;t .
selfish son of bitch .
okay , fine -- $ 500 for food ,
but i am not budging on entertainment .
you only have me budgeted for three massages a week .
it &apos;s insanity .
do you know why this skin is like butter ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s rubbed with butter .
a woman named rhoda
comes to my house and rubs butter on me .
now , do you want to deprive me and her
of that experience ?
yes .
i am 100 % positive i gave beverly that jewelry ,
and i &apos;m outraged that you don &apos;t believe me -- outraged .
so , you &apos;ve been lying to mom this whole time ?
pops , this is bad .
when mom finds out that you &apos;re the one
who forgot where you put the jewelry ,
you &apos;ll be on a budget forever .
rhoda will never butter you up again .
not if we track down that jewelry .
i found this .
it &apos;s a list of nana &apos;s jewelry ,
plus a little clue to help me remember where i put it .
&quot; irene &apos;s necklace , wedding ring , brooch , and gems .
play this until it ends . &quot;
it rhymes .
i like to make things fun .
so what does the clue mean ?
no clue .
you know what this is ? a treasure hunt .
so you &apos;ll help me find it ?
i vowed that my treasure @-@ hunting days were over .
but for you , i &apos;ll come out of retirement .
thanks for coming back .
i know how this is gonna sound ,
but there actually is a bag of lost jewelry ,
and it &apos;s up to us to find it .
dude , this is getting kind of sad .
i &apos;m serious . you &apos;re just gonna have to trust me on this .
all right , but i &apos;m really not supposed to have chocolate .
we don &apos;t have to be goonies this time .
oh , yeah ? so what , then ?
&quot; indiana jones &quot; ? i got to be short round ?
no , dave kim !
this isn &apos;t a movie . this is real life .
and i just really wanted my friends to help me .
so , what &apos;s the plan ?
first , we need to get the rest of our team .
hey , you guys .
hey ! hey !
we need your help .
no fricking way !
not after you sent out those humiliating tapes of us .
yeah !
everyone &apos;s making fun of me at school .
no one will sit next to me at lunch .
girls are ignoring me .
dude , i didn &apos;t send out any tapes .
say what ?
i just said i did to make you guys mad .
no , no , you sent out tapes to everyone at school
and that girl who works at the orange julius at the mall .
i really didn &apos;t .
no tapes .
no tapes ?
no tapes .
well , i &apos;ve got some stuff to think about .
and we &apos;re not helping you . deal with it .
wait .
pops lost a bag of jewelry , and we need to find it .
enough ! i &apos;m so tired of you and that stupid movie .
i know it &apos;s stupid .
look , i know &quot; the goonies &quot; isn &apos;t for everybody .
i know if you got dropped on your head ,
you wouldn &apos;t be a monster with wiggling ears .
i know a kid can &apos;t fall down a pit
and be saved by chattering teeth .
and i can &apos;t tell you why pirates would build a water slide .
but i still love &quot; the goonies &quot; &apos; cause it &apos;s about friends
working together to do something that really matters .
and this really matters .
you know why ?
to quote &quot; goonies , &quot; it &apos;s our time .
it &apos;s our time down here .
damn , that &apos;s a well @-@ written movie .
and just like that , the real adventure had begun .
okay , i &apos;ve torn apart the house from top to bottom ,
and i found some very questionable things --
fireworks , throwing stars ,
barry &apos;s hidden lingerie catalogs ,
erica &apos;s wine coolers , murray &apos;s ding dongs ,
murray &apos;s ho hos , murray &apos;s tastykakes ,
a machete -- don &apos;t know whose this is .
but you know what i didn &apos;t find ?
bevy , i know it &apos;s somewhere in this house .
just give it another look @-@ see .
and if you don &apos;t find it , i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
fine . but this is the last time .
come on , adam . i need this .
we were back in the attic where it all began .
but this time , the treasure hunt was real ,
and one man &apos;s buttery massages depended on it .
wait . there &apos;s something here . look , on the back .
this is part of a treble clef .
this has been ripped off the corner of some sheet music .
sheet music ? i saw some earlier .
guys , i saw this book in a photo .
look . it &apos;s pops and nana and the book .
&quot; play this until it ends . &quot; he means nana &apos;s piano .
it &apos;s in storage at dad &apos;s work .
we need to get his keys .
guys , his pants at the door . duh .
what the hell are you doing ? let &apos;s drive .
no , we &apos;re taking our bikes . it &apos;ll be fun .
it &apos;s all the way back there .
how are we gonna get to it ? there &apos;s no way .
i &apos;ve got this .
i &apos;m super strong &apos; cause i &apos;ve been working out .
yeah , with mom .
not just with mom !
move move . get under me . come on . faster .
it was time to be a leader .
my friends had counted on me to get them this far ,
and there was no turning back .
it was our time .
it &apos;s inside the piano .
sure , it was just old @-@ lady jewelry , but to us ,
it was the greatest treasure we &apos;d ever seen .
unbelievable ,
kiddo . you really did it .
goldbergs never say die .
what are you doing ?
hiding it for your mother to find .
you saw nothing .
listen , pops .
i know mom &apos;s a pain , but this time , she was right .
yeah , pops was stubborn .
but even he knew when it was time to admit he was wrong .
dad .
i know . i &apos;m sorry .
okay .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a little thank @-@ you in advance
for helping me do my budget
and pay my bills and two years of back taxes .
it &apos;s a bit of a cluster bleep .
yes .
but i require no less than four messages a week . i &apos;m not an animal .
that &apos;s the thing about family .
they may hate your movie
or disagree with how you spend your money .
but in the end , they are there with you
to eat some belgian beauties .
that was the first morning
pops didn &apos;t buy the whole restaurant waffles ,
just our family .
hey , everybody !
bloody marys on me !
all right !
technically , it was more expensive ,
but it was a start .
oh , there are my weights .
go away . i &apos;m using them .
well , you &apos;re not using this one correctly .
let me show you how to do it .
i don &apos;t need your help .
yes , you do . and extend .
i know what i &apos;m doing .
and twist .
do you feel that ?
ooh , yeah .
this is what i like to call a rainy @-@ day bike ride .
it &apos;s working your abs ...
oh , my abs ?
... and your quads and your hams and your shins .
so will it get rid of my baby fat ?
okay .
don &apos;t drop it on your face .
we &apos;re marching . we &apos;re in a parade .
who &apos;s the leader of the band ? big tasty . big tasty .
all right , i want you to be completely honest with me ,
dave kim --
mom or no mom ,
my body &apos;s shaping up nice , am i right ?
you people are weird .
( 以及我们一起玩的那次 )
dave kim , your parents are out of town .
you &apos;re throwing a party . how is it going ?
it &apos;s get a lot of ...
but those worth it .
