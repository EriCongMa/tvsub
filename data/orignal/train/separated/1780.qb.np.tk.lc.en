all right , well , can &apos;t you , like ,
slip him some money or something ?

do people like money-- is that what you &apos;re asking ?
a ... a lot of attitude from the woman
who thought mc squared was a rapper .

rajesh ?
yes .
whenever things are going well , i always find a way to ruin it .
you two look happy-- how do you do it ?
i @-@ i think it starts with good communication .
yeah , wait , that &apos;s not a flag question .
next caller .
i hope you don &apos;t think i &apos;m just saying this
because it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day , but ...
i love you so much .
i &apos;m gonna put this down your robe .
it &apos;s not moving , but i think it &apos;s still alive .
well , should we put it back in there a few minutes ?
no .
no , and it &apos;s not a rat , it &apos;s a rabbit .
we need to save it .
well , how do we do that ?
um , i don &apos;t know , look it up on your phone .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna wrap it in a towel .
&quot; taking care of injured rabbit . &quot;
okay .
make sure it &apos;s comfortable and warm .
well , it was just in a hot tub . i &apos;m gonna say &quot; check . &quot;
anything else ?
to make sure it &apos;s not dehydrated ,
feed him an electrolyte solution .
if it &apos;s not responding ,
use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals .
yeah .
this is ridiculous .
you know , i &apos;m gonna go talk to the maitre d .
what are you gonna say ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m gonna flirt with him .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m comfortable with that .
i &apos;m still sleeping with you tonight .
see if you can get a table by the window .
hi there . what &apos;s your name ?
glen .
oh , boy ,
it is crazy in here tonight , huh , glen ?
well , you know , valentine &apos;s day .
yes .
bet your girlfriend is super bummed
you had to work tonight .
anyway , look , we have been waiting a while , and i just ...
with all due respect , ma &apos;am ,
there &apos;s nothing i can do .
you don &apos;t have to call me ma &apos;am .
okay .
i mean , we &apos;re basically the same age .
okay .
how old are you ?
i &apos;m 21 . how old are you ?
just shut up , glen .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
what ? why ?
because i &apos;m young . let &apos;s go .
rajesh , it &apos;s perfectly normal
to have doubts after breaking up with someone .
well , you really think so ?
yeah , you know what &apos;s not normal ?
blubbering about emotions during a flag show .
unless that emotion is excitement over new zealand
changing their flag .
yeah , good luck , you crazy kiwis ,
we &apos;re rooting for you .
your friend is hurting .
no , sheldon &apos;s right .
emily did say i always talk about my feelings too much .
i @-@ i suppose that
could be a legitimate concern in a relationship .
uh , perhaps even a @-@ a red flag .
and speaking of red flags ,
check out this sexy number from the former soviet union .
hubba , hubba .
uh , we @-@ we have another caller .
hi . you &apos;re on fun with flags .
hello . i want to talk about how lonely i am , too .
kripke ? is that you ?
yeah , i &apos;m just sitting here all by myself
wondering if i &apos;ll ever find someone to share my life with .
preferably asian , 18 @-@ 24 , no fatties .
please , all comments and questions
should be flag @-@ related .
all right . is my pole flag @-@ related ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
he &apos;s eating . that &apos;s a good sign .
you &apos;re gonna have to wait one hour
until you can go swimming again .
he &apos;s pretty cute .
he is .
should we ... name him ?
it is valentine &apos;s day .
how about valentino ?
nice . a classic rabbit name .
peter rabbit , roger rabbit .
valentino wolowitz rabbit .
oh , look at all that chest hair and overbite .
of course you &apos;re a wolowitz .
son of a bitch ! he bit me !
are you okay ?
no , i &apos;m not okay !
wild rabbits can have rabies !
oh . well , why did you put your finger near its mouth ?
poor judgment , obviously .
he &apos;s so little . i &apos;m sure it &apos;s fine .
how can it be fine ? i just got attacked
by a clearly anti @-@ semitic wild animal .
it &apos;s not what we planned ,
but this isn &apos;t so bad , right ?
it is freaking amazing .
well , glad you &apos;re feeling better .
i was just hungry and cranky ,
and i &apos;ve never been called &quot; ma &apos;am &quot; before .
is that a big deal ?
kind of .
when was the first time someone called you &quot; sir &quot; ?
sixth grade ,
but i wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase , so ...
can you believe when i met you i was 22 ?
i mean , it &apos;s crazy !
where did all that time go ?
mm , you watched the bachelor a lot .
yeah , go ahead and make jokes ,
but your thirties are almost over .
no , they &apos;re not .
you &apos;re closer to 40 than you are 30 .
you married an old man .
tell you what . let &apos;s do something fun tonight .
won &apos;t make us any younger .
well , maybe not , but some day we actually will be old ,
and we &apos;ll look back on this night
and remember what a good time we had .
okay , like what ?
i know . food fight !
i &apos;ll keep thinking .
look , i know you both feel bad about being alone ,
but sometimes the best thing you can do
is take a little time for yourself ,
especially when you just got out of a relationship .
speaking of ending relationships ,
when british honduras became belize ,
they designed a new flag with a tree on it ,
and i would like to hang myself from that tree .
but , amy , when you and sheldon split up ,
didn &apos;t you start dating someone right away ?
well , i ... i wouldn &apos;t say right away .
and actually , it was three different men .
three different men ? !
damn , girl , way to give the milk away ?
oh , looks like we just lost kripke .
actually , i &apos;m still here .
now ?
yup .
now ?
yup !
now ?
oh , looks like we just lost kripke .
before emily , i was alone for so long .
i just ... i don &apos;t know if i can do that again .
well , you know , here is something that might cheer you up .
the flag of the isle of man
is nothing but three legs
sharing a weird pair of underpants , so ...
you think you got problems .
i have an idea .
maybe someone in our audience
would be interested in meeting rajesh .
ladies , i can attest that he is a kind ,
handsome , intelligent ...
rich parents ! don &apos;t forget , rich parents !
... spoiled astrophysicist who not only ...
well , that was quick .
hi . you &apos;re on fun with flags .
hey , i think i got cut off .
hello , kripke .
i have a flag question .
how many men did you have sex with ?
let &apos;s see . what &apos;s young and fun ?
uh , we could go dancing .
are you actually gonna dance ?
of course . yeah .
no one wants to see that .
hey , how about skinny dipping at the beach ?
no , i don &apos;t need any fish nibbling my business .
oh , there &apos;s a screening of moulin rouge !
i heard the crowd sings along and stuff .
that sounds fun . when &apos;s it start ?
midnight .
midnight . really ?
you know what ? let &apos;s do it .
okay , great !
oh , wait . uh , it &apos;s sold out .
oh , thank god .
yes !
it says , rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely .
oh , terrific .
it &apos;s not terrific .
lots of highly unlikely things happen .
you saw what &apos;s under this robe , and you still married me .
if you &apos;re really worried , we &apos;ll take him to the vet
and have him tested .
good . thank you .
oh , okay , there is a test !
all they have to do is ...
cut off his head and check his brain .
oh , cut off his head ?
that &apos;s where his little nose is .
he &apos;s not showing any symptoms .
i guess i &apos;ll just go to the emergency room to be safe .
howie , this is just your hypochondria .
no , when i sat on the mute button
and thought i &apos;d gone deaf , that was my hypochondria .
we &apos;ll find another time to tell him i &apos;m pregnant .
i mean , this is the first time i &apos;ve ever broken up with someone .
i just ... i didn &apos;t realize it was gonna hurt this much .
it really can .
all right .
nothing about this is fun .
no one wants to talk about flags ,
and i haven &apos;t spoken in over ten minutes ,
so , enjoy your new show , internet .
dr. amy farrah flower present ... with .
i &apos;m sorry for bothering you .
i &apos;ll hang up now .
no , hold on , rajesh .
you know , you &apos;re not being very sympathetic .
you know firsthand that breakups are hard .
fine .
if you insist on making me a part of this ,
yes , i knowledge how painful they can be .
however , pain has an evolutionary purpose .
it provides information from the environment
that , uh , behavior isn &apos;t good for us .
like when i fell in love with that stripper
and bought her a prius .
i &apos;m just gonna push all the buttons .
raj , now , i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re suffering .
when amy and i were broken up , i also suffered .
and this may sound surprising ,
but i &apos;m grateful for having gone through it .
really ?
yes .
i believe our relationship now is stronger than ever .
so do i.
when @-@ when we were apart ,
i learned how important you are to me .
and i realize that when two people are in love ,
sometimes they ...
happy valentine &apos;s day !
we are young and fun !
i stand corrected .
fun .
congratulations on a successful live show .
and a lovely valentine &apos;s day .
cleaning up is not young and fun .
it can be . confetti fight !
maybe you should take a break .
i got this .
did you know the singular of confetti is &quot; confetto &quot; ?
interesting , and when would you use the singular ?
i &apos;m glad you asked .
amy , you have a confetto in your nose .
no , no , no , no . other side .
there you go .
