while you were working ?
oh , you don &apos;t have a job . sorry .
damn , dude , she burned you .
no , hipster .
do not think we &apos;re on the same team .
we have nothing in common .
i wear knit hats when it &apos;s cold out .
you wear knit hats cause of coldplay .
you have tattoos to piss off your dad .
my dad doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s my dad .
and finally ,
you think ...
this is the sound that gets you service .
i think ...
this is the sound that dries up my vagina .
the other waitress disappeared , the russian one .
we need horseradish .

that , ladies , is how you treat a waitress .
paulina !
oh , so ... so good , oh ...

my little cupcake brought me a cupcake .

75 .
oh , earl , if you were just three years younger .

turns out chesty kournikova was vladimir puttin &apos; it out .
hello today . i have paycheck for you .
i need to talk to you . you fired paulina , han ?
i am no longer han lee .
i have new american name
to go with changing neighborhood .

you need to remember this for your immigration exam .
correct . to go with the changing neighborhood .
bryce ?
your name is bryce lee ?
wait , wait , um , um , um ...
don &apos;t hire a new waitress , okay ?
i &apos;ve been doing all the work anyway ,
and i really could use the extra money .
you need help .
no , i don &apos;t .
everyone need help sometimes .
i don &apos;t . i &apos;ve been waiting my whole life , okay ?
i &apos;ve waited on tables , i &apos;ve waited in bars ,
i &apos;ve waited on home pregnancy tests .
i already hire new waitress .
she work in all top restaurants in manhattan .
i gave her paulina &apos;s uniform .
mr. lee , not to complain ,
but i think someone wore this uniform before me ,
like right before me .
is it possible that i could get another one ?
maybe one that &apos;s a little less moist .
also this mustard color doesn &apos;t really go with my skin tone ,
neither do the mustard stains ...
and these various other stains , and smells .
i hope that &apos;s clam chowder .
so ...
i think it &apos;d be better for everyone ,
including my immune system ,
if i just keep on wearing what i &apos;m wearing ,
and not the apron , &apos; cause this is chanel .
so thank you ,
and let &apos;s waitress .
whatever that is ,
it does not belong in this diner .
it belongs in a show on bravo .
but she blonde , hair so shiny ,
good for business .
where do you even find these people ?
the russian hooker , the one before that was a meth addict .
you train her , i am boss .
da boss .
fine , but make her wear the uniform .
are you sure we can &apos;t get the meth addict back ?
she was really good at cleaning .
but her teeth fall out .
you are really judgmental , you know that ?
i &apos;m only gonna say this once , so pay attention .
i &apos;m caroline , by the way . and you &apos;re max ?
don &apos;t get attached .
this is the williamsburg diner , owned by han lee ,
who just changed his name to bryce lee ,
because i guess he wants people to take him even less seriously .
eight months ago he bought it from the russian mob .
clientele used to be all eastern bloc criminals and crack whores ,
but then he took it over and ruined it .
hey , sexy woman .
you look so pretty today .
you look so beautiful , i forgot how bad your personality is .
thanks , oleg .
hey , barbie .
that &apos;s oleg .
he will hit on you aggressively and relentlessly .
he doesn &apos;t realize he looks like that ,
and i don &apos;t have the heart to tell him .
miss , could we have some menus ?
oh , sure .
don &apos;t smile .
cause it raises the bar , and then i have to smile ,
and i can &apos;t be doing that .
it &apos;s exhausting and i have a bad back .
that &apos;s earl , we &apos;re in love .
do not talk to him ,
unless you want to feel whiter than you already are .
oh , and that stain ?
not clam chowder .
go marry the ketchups .
marry the ketchups . i &apos;m on it .
okay . now divorce the ketchups .
stop ! stop ! stop !
there &apos;s no such thing as divorcing the ketchups .
you &apos;ve never waitressed a day in your life .
yes , i have .
you expect me to believe you
after watching that whole temple grandin routine ?
i &apos;m telling lee .
okay , okay ,
i may have enhanced my resume .
enhanced ? what , are we in paris ?
please , i really need this job , okay ?
we lost all of our money .
my trust fund was taken for legal fees .
my dad is in jail .
what ? what are you , martin channing &apos;s daughter ?
where &apos;s the paper ?
martin channing ?
the guy who ripped off the entire city is your father .
he told us we were having a good year .
you &apos;re caroline channing .
you &apos;re like a billionaire .
was . was a billionaire .
they froze all our assets , everything &apos;s gone .
i only have what i could grab ,
and i grabbed all the wrong things .
so do you know the president ?
i &apos;ve met him .
he &apos;s hot .
he &apos;s the president .
have you been to switzerland ?
yes .
do you have a horse ?
yes .
do you know paris hilton ?
no , she &apos;s a hundred .
excuse me , uh , two hot chocolate , please .
comin &apos; up .
let me do that , please .
i &apos;m a really fast learner .
i went to wharton business school .
i got 2,300 on my sat .
can you make a hot chocolate , or not ?
nailed it .
we split the tips . give me yours .
you did better than i thought you would .
listen , tonight i thought of a way
we could make some extra money .
they &apos;ve totally underestimated the price
point on those red velvet cupcakes .
in manhattan the asking price is at least seven ,
so we could sell them for seven , and then pocket the difference .
nothing about that sounds wrong to you ?
it &apos;s not our fault that the idiot who makes the cupcakes
doesn &apos;t know their worth .
i &apos;m the idiot who makes the cupcakes .
new information .
that &apos;s stupid .
no one would pay $ 7 for one of my cupcakes .
really ? &apos; cause ...
well , at least we know you &apos;re not adopted .
so how &apos;d you even end up in brooklyn ?
oh , i went on monster.com.
typed in &quot; place where nobody
from the upper east side would ever go , ever , &quot;
and this diner came up .
you can &apos;t wear a fancy leather jacket outside
in this neighborhood .
you have to turn it inside out .
fur . cool . turn it back .
so where do you live ?
our townhouse was taken and bolted up by the bank , so ...
is this where i &apos;m supposed to feel sorry for you ?
i mean , i don &apos;t want you to ,
but just so you know , a well @-@ adjusted person would .
i &apos;m dead inside .
you make that pretty obvious .
anyway , i &apos;m just gonna stay in the city with a friend .
i live a couple of blocks that way .
i &apos;d walk you to the subway ,
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t want to .
got it .
okay .
robbie !
why is the music so loud ?
it &apos;s 3 : 00 in the morning .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s cool . so what are you doin &apos; ?
the band &apos;s practicing .
but you &apos;re not playing any instruments .
yeah , that &apos;s how we practice .
we , like , listen to other good music ,
and play it in our head .
it &apos;s like the secret .
well , i have a secret for you guys .
get out !
uh , you guys better go .
we should go .
sorry guys , i still have to make the cupcakes .
cupcakes ? for why ? you can just buy &apos; em at the store .
you can do that in the morning , babe , come to bed .
no , i can &apos;t . i have to be in the city by 10 : 00 .
fine . you can have three minutes .
fine , you can have eight , one for each ab .
stand clear of the closing doors .
well , i can cross that off my bucket list .
i have a taser !
oh , my god .
i am so sorry .
i didn &apos;t think it would hurt so much . it &apos;s pink .
it didn &apos;t feel pink .
i didn &apos;t know it was you .
i thought i was being raped .
that &apos;s not what rape feels like .
did you ... did you sleep on the subway ?
i had nowhere else to go ,
and i &apos;m too afraid to sleep outside on the street .
god , you &apos;re spoiled .
next stop , greenpoint .
ugh , get your stuff , come on !
i &apos;ll take you to my place , but hurry .
cause i have to be in the city in 30 minutes .
call me .
oh , my god , you &apos;ve been robbed !
this is how it always looks .
oh , my god , totally cute !
all right , i &apos;ll be back at 4 : 00,
and we can go to work together .
bathroom , bedroom ,
boyfriend sleeps till 4 : 00 , yard .
oh , you have a yard .
looks like a really nice place to relax and do crack .
it is .
i gotta go , i &apos;m gonna be late for my other job in the city .
you have two jobs ?
yes , i babysit for a manhattan socialite diva .
now i have a set .
sorry i &apos;m late .
oh , thank god you &apos;re here ,
there is a bridge and tunnel smell over by the babies
that &apos;s stressing me out .
their diapers probably need to be changed .
again ? i swear , the morning nanny just did that .
motherhood is for reals .
max , remind me , what &apos;s my twitter password ?
twitter password .
yes !
hi , brad . hi , angelina .
max , i need to tell you something because we &apos;re family .
now get me room temperature water and come over here .
we are victims of the channing ponzi scheme .
me , david , and brangelina .
how much money did you lose ?
hold my hands .
nothing .
but it really scared me .
open that ?
so do you know caroline channing ?
no , but she lost everything .
she has no money .
can you imagine having no money ?
i mean , you wouldn &apos;t even have any money .
you should twit that .
and no one will even talk to her .
i heard she went to six different friends &apos; houses
for a place to stay ,
and they all had to pretend they weren &apos;t home .
that &apos;s not cool .
yeah .
that &apos;s really sad .
so sad .
breaks my heart .
i guess motherhood has really opened me up emotionally .
max , i need to hold one of the babies ,
bring me one .
no , the other one . that &apos;s not the good one .
hello .
oh , hi .
oh , i &apos;m so sorry if i woke you up .
who are you ?
i &apos;m max &apos;s friend .
uh , don &apos;t tell her i said that .
i have a feeling if she heard me call her my friend ,
she &apos;d stab me .
what are you doin &apos; over there ?
just washing my uniform ,
trying to make it a little more cute
and a little less crusty .
oh , watch out !
oh ! sorry , oh , my ...
do you have a towel or a rag ?
or something ?
no , i ... i got it .
oh , okay .
i &apos;m robbie .
i &apos;m uncomfortable .
you &apos;re getting me wet .
that &apos;s the point .
you &apos;re max &apos;s boyfriend .
it &apos;s cool .
no , it &apos;s not .
back up , jersey shore .
you &apos;re pathetic ,
and that &apos;s coming from someone who &apos;s homeless
and wearing white after a labor day .
and i &apos;ve seen better .
no , you haven &apos;t .
hey . why didn &apos;t you wait for me ?
i thought we were coming over together .
oh . um , i wanted to get here early to marry the ketchups .
listen , i heard something really upsetting about you today .
what did he say , that i came on to him ?
him who ?
nothing .
him , robbie ?
it &apos;s none of my business ,
but you deserve better than that guy .
yeah , it is none of your business .
ooh , i was just starting to feel sorry for you .
i &apos;m just saying , you &apos;re worth more than that .
what , i &apos;m supposed to believe you about this ?
the person who lied on their resume ,
and lied about the cupcakes ... you &apos;re a liar .
i &apos;m just trying to help .
you know what ?
since you seem to know so much about everything ,
why don &apos;t you take your wharton degree ,
and your ridiculous coat , and figure this all out yourself .
max.max , wait .
oh , look ,
the arcade fire concert just let out across the street ,
good luck with that .
she &apos;s coming back , right ?
she &apos;s not gonna leave me here alone
with a restaurant full of people ?
let me put it to you this way .
you might as well be a night maid
at the schwarzenegger house .
you got screwed .
oh .
oh , yeah .
that feels so good .
now put your tambourine around it .
hi , honey , i &apos;m home .
i want you gone by the time i get back .
babe ! babe , i can explain .
you weren &apos;t supposed to be home .
people say i deserve better than you .
who ? that blonde girl ?
she doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s talkin &apos; about .
she went to wharton
and switzerland .
yo , yo . look at that .
that girl is workin &apos; harder than stephen hawking
tryin &apos; to put in a pair of cufflinks .
here , let me help you with that .
i don &apos;t need any help .
everyone needs help sometimes .
this isn &apos;t what i ordered .
this is caroline .
she may have gotten your order wrong ,
but she does get some things right .
thank you .
no , thank you .
what &apos;d you see in that guy , anyway ?
he had these muscle thingies .
oh , those things ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t know what those are called ,
but they make smart girls stupid .
max !
i thought your tight ass wasn &apos;t coming in tonight ,
and my heart broke in half .
you know what , oleg ?
i needed that .
so i ...
i need a roommate , if you wanna crash .
not gonna lie , the subway &apos;s cleaner than your couch .
i just felt myself starting to like you .
really ? because i really feel like we could ...
i knew that wouldn &apos;t last .
come on .
tomorrow we can go into the city
and get the rest of your stuff .
everything &apos;s locked up .
what , you have nothing that you care about that we can get ?
well , there is one thing .
the weirdest thing is that nobody stopped us .
i &apos;m gonna save a fortune ,
keeping him here instead of in the stables .
when did you put this whole horse @-@ in @-@ my @-@ yard thing together ?
i can &apos;t help it .
i see an opportunity , and i make it happen ,
like with your cupcakes .
like what with my cupcakes ?
ready ? to open a bake shop ,
all we need is 250 grand start @-@ up money ,
for the real estate , and the basic equipment ...
yeah . oh .
250 grand , that &apos;s all ?
yeah .
did freakin &apos; chestnut here kick you in the head
while i was in starbucks ?
hear me out .
if we both worked two jobs
and made $ 2,000 a week ,
we could open a cupcake business in a little over a year .
in the past two days , we &apos;ve made $ 387,
and that &apos;s a good start .
we can make extra money at other jobs ,
like publicists , advertising executives ...
janitors , drug mules .
we really need to work on your self @-@ esteem .
so ...
you , cupcakes , me , business background ,
us , success . what do you think ?
i think you have a horse .
i think we have a horse .
don &apos;t get attached .
