萨凡纳 · 沃克
live from hilton hawaiian village
in beautiful waikiki ,
it &apos;s the savannah walker show !
starring your host , savannah walker !
aloha !
and here she is , the queen of talk ,
savannah !
give it up for my boys .
yes !
aloha , everyone , aloha !
welcome to the show !
now , as you know , we have got it going on
from hawaii all week long .
it has been incredible .
we &apos;ve been shooting everywhere in our country &apos;s 50th state ,
and it has been fantastic .
from the beaches of the north shore
to the skyscrapers of waikiki , we have done it all ,
and it has been amazing .
am i right ?
yes .
but we have saved the very best for last .
my producers thought it would be exciting to do something different ,
something truly out of the box .
and so they arranged for me to hang out with five @-@ o ,
hawaii &apos;s elite crime @-@ fighting task force .
yes .
and with the governor &apos;s blessing ,
i was able to take my camera crew behind the scenes
for the ultimate ride @-@ along .
now , i want to warn you , this is not gonna be
one of our typical savannah shows .
it is going to be scary , it &apos;s going to be graphic ,
and it might be a good idea to put those little ones down
for an early nap .
because i am talking unscripted ,
unedited and unbelievable .
are you ready ?
all right ! this is gonna be off the hook !
tommy , roll the tape .
welcome to the home of five @-@ o.
this beautiful building opened in 1871,
designed by australian thomas rowe
in an italian renaissance revival .
it doesn &apos;t look like your average police station , does it ?
that &apos;s because five @-@ o aren &apos;t your typical cops .
they &apos;re a task force that handles high @-@ priority cases .
cases that often put them in life and death situations .
in this show ,
we &apos;re gonna get to know five @-@ o &apos;s key personnel .
to start , let &apos;s meet the big kahuna ,
lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett ,
the boss man and honolulu native .
born and raised on the island of oahu ,
steve was a celebrated quarterback
for the fightin &apos; nuts of kukui high ,
a standout at the naval academy
and a highly decorated navy seal
who saw action around the globe .
hi , commander mcgarrett .
hi .
hi . i understand you were handpicked
by the late governor jameson , uh , to lead five @-@ o ,
and tasked with cleaning up crime on the islands .
that &apos;s , um , a pretty awesome task .
uh , i &apos;m sorry ,
五零特遣队
was i supposed to say something back to you ?
well , that &apos;s how an on @-@ camera interview works .
i , um , ask the questions , and then you answer .
okay , um , i &apos;m not really comfortable with that ,
and , uh , i don &apos;t ...
i thought you guys were just gonna follow us around .
you know ?
okay , this is gonna be a little tougher than i thought .
um , well , okay .
working alongside steve mcgarrett
is detective danny williams ,
a new jersey transplant who seems to have brought
his feisty jersey attitude with him .
um , detective williams , can i ...
no , no @-@ no @-@ no , no @-@ no @-@ no .
please , okay ? i know the governor thinks
五零特遣队
that this is good pr , but i disagree strongly ,
so please keep the camera out of my face and we &apos;ll be fine .
please ? i said please . thank you .
peace .
oh , lieutenant kelly .
can i ask you a few questions ?
五零特遣队
i &apos;m a little bit busy right now .
well , i understand that commander mcgarrett &apos;s father trained you .
what drew you to a life in law enforcement ?
uh , family .
i come from a long line of cops .
i guess it &apos;s in my dna .
well , if you weren &apos;t a cop , what would you be ?
jazz trumpet .
really ? like miles davis ?
well , there &apos;s only one miles davis , but ...
maybe that &apos;s why i became a cop .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me .
no , it &apos;s good , we &apos;re on the way .
hey , chin , let &apos;s go . yo , let &apos;s go !
oh , oh . this is it , we caught a case .
come on , let &apos;s go .
uh , commander mcgarrett ,
uh , can you tell us where we &apos;re going ?
did you sign the personal safety waiver ?
you guys all need to do that , all right , before you come .
uh ... make sure they get one .
a safety waiver ? why ?
wait . wait , what &apos;s so funny ?
better call your insurance agent from the car .
tell him you want full coverage .
wait , you guys-- you &apos;re kidding , right ?
they &apos;re kidding , right ?
come on , come on ! we got to keep up .
i &apos;m trying .
try harder , we &apos;re losing them !
you want me to run all the red lights ?
fine . but you &apos;re paying the tickets .
it &apos;s a deal .
just don &apos;t lose them .
don &apos;t tell anyone .
okay , we &apos;re at the crime scene with five @-@ o.
let &apos;s take a look .
duke , what do you got ?
it &apos;s a real mess down there .
let &apos;s increase the radius to include this rooftop here .
it &apos;s got a clear line of sight .
there might be a surveillance camera
that picked something up .
wait , wait , wait , what are you doing ?
this is as far as you go , okay ?
we won &apos;t get in the way .
i &apos;m sorry , it &apos;s my crime scene , my rules .
okay ?
okay .
zoom in there .
i want to see what they &apos;re looking at .
oh , my god .
is all of that blood ?
billy , boost the levels up .
i want to hear what they &apos;re saying .
that &apos;s some serious mutilation .
killer must have used an axe or a cleaver .
did he say &quot; mutilated &quot; ?
let &apos;s get max over here right away .
okay , come on , come on , come on .
officer kalakaua , can you tell us who the victim is ?
五零特遣队
can you at least tell us if it was a man or a woman ?
we don &apos;t know .
you won &apos;t say &apos; cause it &apos;ll compromise the case ?
no . i &apos;m telling you , we don &apos;t know .
central to m.e. two .
five @-@ o is at your crime scene ,
requesting you expedite
due to special circumstances .
steve , you ever seen anything like this ?
never .
welcome back .
now , when my producers suggested i conduct a ride @-@ along
with hawaii &apos;s elite task force ,
five @-@ o ,
i thought we &apos;d be breaking up bar fights
or maybe busting shoplifters .
i had no idea we &apos;d be
standing over a dead body in an alley .
and to top it all off ,
they can &apos;t tell if the victim is a man or a woman .
i have to tell you , if this is a typical day
at the office for these guys ,
i am so glad i &apos;m not a cop .
let &apos;s take a look .
no blood trail indicates this was most likely a body dump .
savannah , m.e. &apos; s office .
okay , let &apos;s go .
that is dr. max bergman .
he &apos;s a medical examiner with the city of honolulu .
his job is to examine the body for cause of death
and search for physical clues left behind by the killer .
let &apos;s talk to him .
dr. bergman .
i &apos;m ...
法医
oh , savannah walker !
i know who you are .
you do ?
i find your show to be quite inspiring .
really ?
yes , i mean , y @-@ your compelling interviews ,
your self @-@ improvement segments ,
your unusual foray into pop culture .
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s quite inspirational .
wow , you really are a fan .
yes , i mean , i wake up at 5 : 00 a.m. each morning
so i can catch the &quot; live feed &quot; from the mainland .
i got hooked on to your show
during my undergrad years at arizona state .
uh , uh , and the christmas segment
where you did the reenactment of , uh , the birth of jesus
and the camel kept on licking the baby-- oh , my god .
it had me in stitches !
not literally , but metaphorically .
well , uh , a.s.u. , i understand ,
has an incredible life sciences program .
oh , it &apos;s exceptional .
but , uh , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s the party scene--
that &apos;s the reason why i went there .
it &apos;s off the hook .
not many people know this , but , uh , in my frat house ,
i was referred to as &quot; beerman &quot; instead of bergman .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m talking to you right now !
i &apos;m thrilled to meet you , too .
um , listen , dr. bergman , i &apos;m wondering , you know ,
since you &apos;re such a ... a faithful viewer ,
if i might not ask you for a little favor .
of course .
on close examination , victim is male , caucasian .
face desecrated beyond recognition .
lower arms exhibit significant trauma ,
with both hands appearing to be severed above the wrist .
liver temp indicates our victim
was murdered eight to ten hours ago .
killer must have hacked up the body to prevent i.d.
it &apos;s a pro move .
max , what is that ?
what ?
there &apos;s a camera on your shirt , max .
oh , this camera .
nice try .
is this yours ?
yeah .
sorry .
this was not part of the agreement .
well , it &apos;s called &quot; investigative reporting , &quot; commander .
oh , that &apos;s what it &apos;s called when you interview
chefs and celebrities , huh ?
this is not 60 minutes .
hold on .
for your information ,
i have a degree in journalism from northwestern .
your professors must be very proud .
let &apos;s erase that .
savannah , behind you .
officer , can i ask you a few questions , please ?
the victim has yet to be identified .
do you have any suspects ?
not at this time .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me ...
wait , if i could just get a name .
hey , guys ! it &apos;s wo fat !
savannah , get down !
did you get that ?
please tell me you got that .
duke , call it in .
get a bird in the air right now .
wo fat &apos;s not getting off this island .
who is wo fat ?
wo fat is a ruthless son of a bitch .
w ... wait , can i say that on tv ?
you already did .
wo fat is a global terrorist .
he tortured and murdered innocent people .
he supplies arms to our country &apos;s enemies .
he &apos;s a true sociopath .
he &apos;s devoid of any morals ...
or scruples .
seems like there &apos;s ... more to this guy .
what aren &apos;t you telling us ?
wo fat was the man behind the murder of john mcgarrett .
steve &apos;s father .
he would &apos;ve killed steve &apos;s mother , too ,
if given the opportunity .
so what you &apos;re saying is that capturing wo fat
is personal for steve ?
that &apos;s the way this job is .
sometimes it crosses over into the personal .
has it ever gotten personal for you ?
yes .
sadly , after this interview , i learned that lieutenant kelly
lost someone very dear to him , his wife , malia ,
as a direct result of a five @-@ o investigation .
now , out of respect , i won &apos;t go into further detail ,
but what i will tell you is that
despite their personal losses ,
five @-@ o has forged an incredible bond ,
one akin to family ,
or what the locals refer to as &quot; &apos; ohana . &quot;
now , what if i was to tell you that we--
and by &quot; we &quot; i mean this show--
had a direct hand in helping this investigation ?
to explain how ,
let &apos;s meet officer kono kalakaua .
kono grew up on the north shore of o &apos;ahu
and spent the early part of her life as a professional surfer .
now , when a knee injury sidelined her career ,
she followed in the footsteps of her cousin , chin ho kelly ,
and joined the ranks of law enforcement .
a skilled sniper and martial artist ,
kono explains here
how five @-@ o uses technology
to help solve crimes .
in a lot of cases , we use public surveillance cameras
because they allow us to capture evidence of criminal activity .
however , this case was a little different because we had
your crew tagging along with us the whole time ,
so what we did was we took the video you shot
and enhanced it
in order to get a better look at our suspect , wo fat .
when you say &quot; enhanced , &quot; what do you mean exactly ?
uh , well , five @-@ o is , um , equipped
with the latest in digital forensic hardware ,
which allows us to improve image quality by manipulating zoom ,
frame rate , um , angle ,
uh , at the same time increasing resolution .
wow . who on the five @-@ o team
is well @-@ versed in all this high @-@ tech wizardry ?
uh , that would be me .
how on earth did you get so tech @-@ savvy ?
xbox .
here he is over the body
when we arrived on @-@ scene .
what is wo fat looking for ?
and why show up posing as a cop ?
my guess is he heard about the murder after the fact ;
shows up wearing the uniform
so he can get access to the crime scene .
which would mean that wo fat &apos;s not the killer .
okay , fine .
why &apos;s he so interested in our john doe ?
oh , welcome . please , come in , come in .
ms. walker , so good to see you again .
billy , todd ,
always a pleasure .
where are your glasses , max ?
oh , i &apos;m wearing contacts .
uh , they don &apos;t respond to indoor precipitation
like my spectacles do .
uh @-@ huh . is that gel in your hair ?
thank you for noticing , detective .
huh . lost him to hollywood .
max .
at your service .
okay . were @-@ were you any closer on an i.d. for the victim ?
not yet .
afis was out of the question
because the victim &apos;s hands were removed .
i did submit
a dna sample to codis ,
but the results came back negative .
there were no matches in the missing persons database .
however , i was able to confirm that the c.o.d.--
that &apos;s cause of death-- was indeed a shotgun wound .
and upon closer examination , i noticed that the victim &apos;s skin
was removed from the upper right arm
in near @-@ surgical precision .
you mind stepping to your right a little bit ?
yes , i mind . beat it . go away .
what &apos;d i tell you ? keep that camera out of my face .
get the hell out of here .
in here .
i told the investigators
that the mutilation of the body
was caused by a high @-@ energy and blunt force trauma
with an implement like a hammer .
but also a portion of the skin was excised
on the right upper limb between the elbow joint and the shoulder .
what do you mean by &quot; excised &quot; ?
well , the killer cut the skin off with a razor or a scalpel .
most likely , the missing part had an identifying mark ,
like a tattoo or a scar .
so now what ? how do you identify the victim ?
well , shotgun pellets recovered from the victim may help .
i sent them over to fong .
fong ? what &apos;s a fong ?
i &apos;m here with charlie fong ,
criminalist for the honolulu police department .
now , charlie , tell me ,
what does a criminalist do ?
well , that can vary a lot from day to day .
one day , i might get called to court ,
犯罪学家
the next day , i could be running qc samples all day .
then there are other days when i &apos;m ...
if you could sum it up in one sentence ,
what would it be ?
i analyze evidence to solve crimes .
one sentence exactly , that was impressive .
precision . that &apos;s what my job is all about .
kind of like a quarterback throwing a perfect ,
chest @-@ high spiral .
if you &apos;re off even a little ,
well , it could cost you the ball game .
hmm . now , do you ever get out in the field ?
on occasion .
but solving crimes isn &apos;t all about getting shot at .
actually , most of the heavy lifting is done here
behind a microscope .
this is where the real action is .
wow , so you &apos;re like the brains behind five @-@ o.
well ... there &apos;s no &quot; i &quot; in team ,
but someone has to show them the way .
well , i understand that dr. max bergman sent over
some shotgun pellets to analyze .
what have you come up with ?
nothing yet .
hey , guys .
so , danny was right about our m.o.
this was the work of a pro .
it &apos;s a russian mob out of kansas city .
so i contacted the kcpd organized crime bureau ,
and apparently hacking up enemies is a local specialty .
all right , look , we need to get a list of possible associates ,
uh , anybody traveling from over there with an alias .
right .
it &apos;s already done . dimitri markov .
flew in two days ago .
checked into the grand kuali &apos;i in waikiki .
come on . let &apos;s check it out .
ladies and gentlemen , lunch is served .
uh , looks amazing , but listen , big guy .
we got to rain @-@ check this , all right ?
don &apos;t worry . flippa can doggy @-@ bag that for you .
all of kamekona shrimp truck meals travel exceptionally well ,
and at only $ 9.99 per plate , easy on the wallet , too .
super tasty grinz anyone ?
hey , hey , hey . what are you doing ?
product placement , brah .
and for today only ,
anyone mentioning the savannah walker show
gets 50 % off .
that &apos;s half price .
you know , this , uh ...
doesn &apos;t actually go on the tv today .
it airs another day .
you gonna honor this thing , uh ...
you know , on that day as well ?
looks like a yes .
thank you .
whatever our vic was involved in ,
it was important enough to get
the attention of a couple of heavyweights
like the russian mob and wo fat , all right ?
if the kc mob sent markov down here to whack our guy ,
he would &apos;ve left , he wouldn &apos;t have stuck around .
i agree , but the motel says he hasn &apos;t checked out yet .
doesn &apos;t make sense . guy comes down here , kills somebody
and sticks around for a tan ? no sense .
doesn &apos;t sound very &quot; pro &quot; to me .
okay , let me get this straight--
this is detective williams &apos; car ,
but commander mcgarrett does all the driving ?
it &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m the better driver .
he &apos;s a control freak . that &apos;s why he drives .
and he &apos;s got issues with , uh , the truth .
okay . why don &apos;t you tell her
about the remote control thing you got ?
what remote control thing ?
the thing where you come to my house
and you grab the clicker and you got to be in charge
and you got to pick which tv station we watch .
okay , the way i was brought up ...
it &apos;s polite to let the guest choose
what you &apos;re gonna watch on tv , all right ?
okay . fair enough . what about having to be
first through every single door ?
or having the last word every conversation ?
or picking where i eat lunch every single day ?
you . why ?
what @-@ what does emily post have to say about that ?
i &apos;m not gonna-- i mean , you &apos;re indecisive .
i can &apos;t help it if you &apos;re indecisive .
i &apos;m not indecisive . you &apos;re a control freak .
these two fight , but really ... they love each other .
where do you want to go for lunch today ?
i &apos;ll go wherever you want to go .
oh , my god . see ?
we &apos;re here at the grand kuali &apos;i ,
where we believe our suspect , the russian mobster
dimitri markov , is staying .
you stay here , you understand ?
you don &apos;t go any further than this .
five @-@ o !
go , go , go .
clear left .
clear here .
billy , over here .
those look like surveillance photos .
hey ! what &apos;d i just tell you ?
i told you to wait back there , didn &apos;t i ?
over there . he &apos;s the one they &apos;re looking for .
commander , he &apos;s over here .
what ? what ?
the suspect .
that &apos;s the suspect .
hey , dimitri markov ,
let me see your hands . now !
hey ! freeze !
i said hold it right there !
did he really just do that ?
welcome to my world .
steve ?
what &apos;s he saying ?
not much . he &apos;s , uh ...
he &apos;s claiming he &apos;s never heard of wo fat .
he did admit to stalking the victim ,
but he won &apos;t i.d. him ,
and he certainly won &apos;t cop to the murder .
that doesn &apos;t surprise me , &apos; cause he &apos;s not our guy .
now , you guys know what an alibi is , right ?
i know you know .
it &apos;s when you tell your wife you &apos;ve been working all weekend ,
but you &apos;re really out playing golf with your boys .
right ? we &apos;ve all done it .
but in this case ,
the russian hit man had a great alibi ,
because two security cameras put him all the way
on the north shore at the time the murder took place .
but five @-@ o still thought he was a piece of the puzzle
because of these . you remember these ?
the photos they found at markov &apos;s motel room ?
well , it turns out that these photos were of the victim .
so , i ran facial recognition on those surveillance photos
and got a hit to a roger carson .
there &apos;s not a lot on him in the system ,
but he rents an apartment here ,
so i sent a unit by .
they said they saw signs of forced entry ,
so they sat on the place until we got here .
five @-@ o !
clear !
clear !
it &apos;s an easter egg hunt .
well , somebody was looking for something .
could have been markov before we grabbed him .
could have been wo fat .
or our butcher .
kono , what do you got ?
ran our vic &apos;s credit cards .
roger carson checked into the waikiki sun motel
by the airport 36 hours ago .
that &apos;s only a couple miles from here .
why would he need a second place so close to home ?
manager said he checked in with a woman .
roger ? is that you ?
ma &apos;am , it &apos;s five @-@ o.
ma &apos;am , if you &apos;d open the door , please .
how you doing ?
i &apos;m , uh , commander steve mcgarrett .
this is detective danny williams .
what &apos;s your name ?
kammie leeds .
miss leeds , how do you know roger carson ?
he &apos;s my boyfriend .
oh , my god , something bad &apos;s happened , hasn &apos;t it ?
may we come in , please ?
you guys stay here .
miss leeds ...
okay , get out of here .
commander , can you share with us
what the victim &apos;s girlfriend had to say ?
couple days ago , they came home ,
and they found their apartment tossed .
carson said it was a robbery .
he moved her in here , and then he disappeared .
does it get to you ?
excuse me ?
having to inform a loved one about a death .
it &apos;s difficult .
you &apos;re delivering the worst information
anybody &apos;s ever gonna tell them ,
and you &apos;re about to change their life forever
with that information .
how do you cope with that ?
you don &apos;t cope with it .
you use it to keep going .
i wasn &apos;t comfortable pressing commander mcgarrett
for more information at such a clearly sensitive time .
but later , i was told that the victim &apos;s girlfriend ,
when shown an autopsy photo ,
pointed out that the skin removed from roger &apos;s arm
was right where he had a tattoo .
for some reason , the killer wanted it .
yeah , i remember that guy .
came in for a custom job .
what kind of custom job ?
some sort of mythical thing .
like a goddess .
look at all these photos on the wall .
you take a picture of the goddess ?
yeah , i wanted to , piece came out real tight .
but dude was all cagey about it .
wouldn &apos;t let me .
what about the stencil paper you use as a template in the beginning ?
you , uh ... you got that ?
no , i already gave that to the other cop .
wait . what other cop ?
he came in this morning asking about the same customer .
is this the cop ?
yeah , brah , that &apos;s him .
all right , you got cameras in here , or what ?
yeah , right there .
does it work ?
yeah .
how far back &apos;s it go ?
uh , we clear the disks every week .
want to take a look ?
yeah , we do .
all right .
there . that &apos;s the artwork for the tattoo .
kono , uh , can you isolate that image ?
uh , chin , what do you think ?
well , the way she &apos;s emerging from the stream--
almost like she &apos;s made of water--
makes me think of kalawahine .
ka ... that &apos;s crazy . i was gonna say the same exact thing .
yeah , she &apos;s an ancient goddess .
protector of all the water sources in the ko &apos;olau valley ,
formed by a mountain range on the leeward coast .
hold on . steve , look at this .
looks like there &apos;s a pattern or something
in the bottom of the skirt .
you see that ?
and it looks the same as one of these trails .
he &apos;s right . check it out .
kono , can you , uh ...
can you overlay this @-@ this trail pattern ,
uh , and the image of the tattoo ?
well , that is not just a tattoo .
then what is it ?
it &apos;s a map .
now , most guys get a tattoo of a dragon
or barbed wire
or their girlfriends &apos; name ,
but not roger carson .
his tattoo was of a very specific area of o &apos;ahu
called the ko &apos;olau valley .
and the question five @-@ o was asking :
what did it mean ?
the only reason i can think of why anybody would tattoo a map
onto their body is to hide something valuable
and not forget where it is , right ?
well , whatever our vic stashed , it was valuable enough
for a russian mobster and wo fat
to come out of the woodwork looking for it .
and don &apos;t forget about our killer .
he was the first one to get to carson .
he knew about the map , he hacked up our vic ,
then cut the tattoo off his arm .
well , if our killer has the map ,
then maybe this is where he &apos;s headed next .
okay , there &apos;s only one problem ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s 45 trails stretched out
over 50 miles of terrain .
so where do we start ?
to help five @-@ o figure it out ,
they enlisted the help of lieutenant catherine rollins
of naval intelligence .
um , uh , sometimes ...
well , actually , make that a lot of the times ,
commander mcgarrett will ask for my help .
and he usually repays me in breakfast or dinner .
it &apos;s kind of like a little game that we play .
using military resources to help a friend--
uh , isn &apos;t that risky ?
uh , well , steve and my c.o. go way back ,
so he cuts him some slack .
what about you and steve ?
tell us about your history .
uh , we served in the military together .
you &apos;re also his girlfriend , right ?
uh , how is that relevant ?
just , america wants to know .
well , that &apos;s none of america &apos;s business , so ...
okay , um , well , what about this case ?
how did you help steve ?
well , he had asked me for some advanced satellite imagery
of the ko &apos;olau valley &apos;s trail system
to help determine where his victim , roger carson ,
uh , might have hidden something .
should i take this off now ?
no ? sorry . okay .
hey , steve ?
yeah .
there &apos;s a secret service agent on the phone .
he says he needs to talk to you right now .
commander mcgarrett ?
yes .
i &apos;m special agent kershaw . we need to talk .
okay , well , agent kershaw , i &apos;m in the middle
of an active murder investigation .
your homicide is why i &apos;m calling .
this is a matter of national security , commander .
can i be assured
of the confidentiality of this conversation ?
agent kershaw , hold that thought for a second .
i need you guys to shut this down right now , okay ,
and wait in my office . right now , let &apos;s go .
later , commander mcgarrett was able to share
with me what that call was about .
it turns out , our victim &apos;s name wasn &apos;t roger carson ,
but gary ray percy .
and before hawaii , he resided in washington d.c. ,
where he worked at the bureau of engraving and printing .
that &apos;s right , where money is printed .
and he was a well @-@ trusted employee
right up until he started taking his work home with him .
who &apos;s ever seen one of these ?
couple of people ?
it &apos;s called a 3 @-@ d printer .
now , who &apos;s got a phone i can borrow ?
you guys are very generous .
thank you .
i promise to return it .
now , i &apos;m gonna show you just how easy this is .
you put the phone here ...
turn the machine on ,
and the computer scans your item .
and then ... you have ...
an exact 3 @-@ d replica of your phone .
right ?
now , imagine if you could use this machine
to replicate the master plates for the u.s. $ 100 bill .
that &apos;s what mr. percy did .
he smuggled the 3 @-@ d printer into his office
and made an exact replica of the u.s. $ 100 currency plates .
whoever tossed percy &apos;s apartment must have thought
that &apos;s where he was hiding the plates .
well , agent kershaw said there was a leak in his department ,
so i &apos;m thinking that &apos;s how wo fat
and the russian mob got on to it .
either one of them could have been looking for those plates .
well , it definitely wasn &apos;t our killer .
he knew the plates weren &apos;t there .
he had inside information .
he found out about the tattoo ,
killed percy and cut it off his arm .
okay , well , there &apos;s only one person who knew percy
well enough to know about the tattoo
and whether or not he could &apos;ve been hiding something .
i told you , i don &apos;t know .
roger never said anything about washington d.c.
or any currency plates .
you mean percy . gary ray percy .
percy , carson , roger--
whatever you want to call him .
he told me he used to sell big @-@ ticket appliances in denver .
washing machines , ranges , stoves .
oh , you believed that ?
i had no reason not to .
okay , well , here &apos;s our problem .
okay , we don &apos;t believe you , all right ?
so you either give us some better answers ,
or we &apos;re gonna release you from protective custody .
which i think would be a bad thing ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s a psychopath out there hacking people up .
don &apos;t think you want that .
your choice .
after our place was ransacked ,
roger , my boyfriend , started acting all paranoid .
i said , &quot; okay , we got burglarized .
let &apos;s just go to the cops . &quot;
but he was all freaked out ,
and said he didn &apos;t want to involve the cops .
so you went to the motel .
what about this guy ?
you know this man ?
no .
his name is wo fat .
you &apos;ve never met this guy ?
no .
okay , who &apos;d you tell about the break @-@ in ?
my brother , tony .
tony .
tony own a shotgun ?
think so . why ?
why ? &apos; cause it &apos;s the last thing your boyfriend saw .
all right , i &apos;m thinking kammie confides in tony , all right ?
tells him about the break @-@ in , about having to go on the run .
and brother , being the criminal genius that he is ,
puts two and two together .
realizes percy was in possession of something valuable .
exactly . tony tracks down percy ,
puts both barrels to his head ,
percy starts talking , he tells him everything .
tells him about the currency plates ,
about the map tattoo , about the russian stalking him .
all right , and then tony kills percy ,
makes it look like a mob hit .
that was to throw us off .
well , then he cuts the tattoo off percy &apos;s arm
so no one else can find it , and goes on a treasure hunt .
exactly but what tony does not know is
that wo fat is looking for the same plates .
steve ?
hey . so , i got those hi @-@ res sat photos
from the ko &apos;olau valley trail system .
great .
take a look at this .
all right , see those two trees there in the clearing ?
they look just like our vic &apos;s tattoo .
where was this photo taken ?
a trail head at waimona ridge .
you think that &apos;s where the plates are buried ?
if it is , that &apos;s where tony &apos;s headed .
formed on oahu &apos;s leeward coast ,
largely inaccessible by car ,
the ko &apos;olau valley lies within the jagged remains of an ancient volcano .
home to a system of treacherous hiking trails
that climb some 3,100 feet above sea level ,
it &apos;s easy to see why gary ray percy chose this location
to hide his copies of the $ 100 engraving plates .
right here .
the gps says this is the spot .
here are the two banyan trees , there &apos;s the mountain ,
just like the tattoo .
hey , you see this ?
looks like it was just dug up .
guys , over here !
i &apos;ve got tony .
whoa , whoa , you , stay back .
you , hey , back it up .
plates are gone .
wo fat must have tracked him here .
the body &apos;s still warm .
wo fat &apos;s got to be close .
get out of my way ! go ! move it !
got fresh tracks .
steve , it &apos;s wo fat !
don &apos;t let him get away !
come on , move , move , move !
over here .
he &apos;s gone .
we need to secure the perimeter .
i got blood .
well , he can &apos;t have got too far .
down ! get down !
chin !
chin , you all right ?
let &apos;s get out .
i &apos;m okay . got my vest .
oh my god . are you okay ?
yeah , i think so .
camera &apos;s toast .
what are you doing ?
trying to get my phone .
are you crazy ? put it away .
i got to get this !
come on !
hold your fire ! hold your fire !
i got him !
got him ?
finish it !
do it !
intubate the patient , give him ten milligrams of morphine
all right , he gets his own floor .
i want a full security lockdown , guns on every exit .
nobody gets in or out without my approval .
commander mcgarrett , is he going to make it ?
i don &apos;t care .
plan blue .
all available staff to o.r.
plan blue .
all available staff to o.r.
there you have it , folks .
another case solved by our
nation &apos;s most elite task force , five @-@ o !
you know , over 24 pulse @-@ pounding hours ,
my crew and i shadowed their every move .
it was terrifying , and it was dangerous .
and it was something that i will never , ever do again .
over the course of a day , we risked our lives
to bring you this very special episode .
but you know what ?
it is nothing compared to the risks
that the brave members of five @-@ o take every day
to keep these islands safe .
they are truly heroes .
and i salute them .
until next time ,
mahalo nui loa .
oh , yes , thank you .
thanks for coming out .
thank you .
