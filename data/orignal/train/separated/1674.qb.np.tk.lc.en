hold .
what ?
explain your sneeze .
i &apos;m sorry ?
do you have allergies ?
no .
is there too much pepper on your salad ?
i don &apos;t put pepper on salads .
i &apos;ve heard enough . sit over there .
oh , come on.i don &apos;t want to sit by myself .
that &apos;s what typhoid mary said ,
and clearly , her friends buckled .
guys , help me .
sheldon , come on .
yeah , it &apos;s just one sneeze .
you &apos;re on your own .
see you , buddy .
oh , leonard , i have something for you .
per our roommate agreement , this is your 24 @-@ hour notice that i will be having
a non @-@ related female spending two nights in our apartment .
when you say &quot; non @-@ related female , &quot;
you still mean human , right ?
of course .
pets are banned under the roommate agreement ,
with the exception of service animals , such as seeing eye dogs
and , one day , cybernetically @-@ enhanced helper monkeys .
are you planning on kidnapping a woman ?
sarcasm ?
yes , but mixed with genuine concern .
for your information , i &apos;ll be playing host to dr. elizabeth plimpton .
the cosmological physicist from princeton ?
yes .
and until you acquire a surgical mask ,
please address your comments to me through a napkin .
we &apos;ve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in
gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe .
and now she &apos;s under consideration for a position at our university .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you knew elizabeth plimpton ?
i am a huge fan of hers !
i didn &apos;t realize i was obligated to share my connection
with things you &apos;re a fan of , but very well .
you enjoy canadian bacon .
i &apos;ve been to toronto .
okay , fine . where is she going to sleep ?
my room , of course .
holy crap !
holy crap !
yeah , um , i have a two @-@ part question .
go ahead .
a : are you kidding me ?
and b : seriously , are you freaking kidding me ?
a : i rarely kid .
and b : when i do kid , you will know it by my use of the word &quot; bazinga . &quot;
so you &apos;re saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed ?
yes .
bazinga .
leonard ?
thank you .
why is a world @-@ renowned scientist
staying in our apartment instead of a hotel ?
well , she doesn &apos;t care for hotels .
and who can blame her ?
windows that don &apos;t open ,
multi @-@ user linens ,
keys shaped like credit cards-- as if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one &apos;s wallet .
all right , i believe i have time
for one more question .
yes , raj ?
when can i sit with you again ?
when i &apos;ve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures
spaced 12 hours apart . you know the drill .
all right , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i am off to start
a prophylactic course of antibiotics .
i can &apos;t believe he &apos;s friends with elizabeth plimpton .
i can &apos;t believe they let him into canada .
whoa , whoa , whoa . you heard the man .
where &apos;s your throat cultures ?
kidding . sit down .
hey , sheldon .
oh , penny , excellent .
i have a question about these maxi pads .
are the wings truly functional
or have i fallen victim to marketing hype ?
what ?
why are you doing with-- what ?
the stock boy at walgreens
was frustratingly uninformed on the subject .
sheldon , what are you doing with maxi pads ?
i have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days .
what ?
i want her to feel at home .
i also bought scented soaps , pantyhose , midol ,
calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt
specifically designed to regulate the female bowel .
wait , wait , hold on , back up .
you &apos;re having a woman stay with you ?
yes .
why does that seem to flabbergast everybody ?
oh ... no , no , no , no .
i &apos;m not flabbergasted .
i &apos;m ... puzzled .
yeah , let &apos;s go with puzzled .
a word of warning .
my guest is a noted physicist
and the leading expert on quantum cosmology ,
so please try to avoid wasting her time
with female jibber jabber .
female jibber jabber ?
shoe sales , hair styles ,
mud masks , gossip about your friends brad and angelina .
oh , they &apos;re not my friends .
i &apos;m not surprised , considering the way you talk about them behind their backs .
she &apos;s here , she &apos;s here .
how do i look ? do i look smart ?
oh , good grief . this isn &apos;t about you .
coming !
now , listen .
one of the great minds of the 21st century
is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century .
so pay attention .
years from now , my biographer might ask you about this event .
oh , i have so many things to tell your biographer .
dr. cooper , thank goodness . i completely forgot your address .
but then i remembered that i &apos;d written it on my hand .
lucky for me ,
i didn &apos;t confuse it with what i &apos;d written on my other hand ,
which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star .
&apos;cause if i tried to go there , i &apos;d be crushed by hypergravity .
anyway , hello .
hello .
nice to finally meet you in person .
i would imagine it is .
this is my friend and roommate , dr. leonard hofstadter .
hi @-@ lo .
i @-@ i started to say &quot; hi , &quot;
and then i switched to &quot; hello &quot; in the middle .
it came out &quot; hi @-@ lo . &quot;
uh , it &apos;s nice to meet you .
i @-@ i &apos;ve read both your books and most of your papers .
i @-@ i &apos;m leonard , i live here , you &apos;re brilliant .
i apologize .
he &apos;s only an experimental physicist .
no need to apologize .
some of my best friends are experimental physicists .
well , not my best friends , but i know them .
my best friend is
a molecular chemist named wendy .
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m rambling .
hi @-@ lo .
are you hungry , thirsty ?
can i offer you anything ?
no , she &apos;s my guest .
if anyone should offer her anything , it should be me .
elizabeth , can i get you something ?
perhaps a feminine hygiene product
or a bowel @-@ regulating yogurt ?
interesting choices .
based on my current needs , i guess i &apos;d pick the yogurt .
excellent .
if the yogurt works ,
i bought some delightful scented candles .
look , it &apos;s you .
thank you so much for opening up your home to me .
well , who wants to stay in a hotel ?
windows that don &apos;t open , those crazy card @-@ shaped keys .
i &apos;m so glad you understand .
no , he doesn &apos;t understand .
i understand .
well , i understand , too .
you &apos;re just misappropriating my understanding .
i think any university would want you .
except , of course , any university that had already had you .
because they would &apos;ve already wanted you before they , you know , got you .
from the mind that brought you &quot; hi @-@ lo . &quot;
let me show you to your room .
all right .
i guess i am tired . good night , leonard .
uh , sleep night .
i mean , obviously , good night .
i started to say &quot; sleep tight , &quot;
then i changed my mind in the middle .
i swear to god , i &apos;m smart .
get it together , man .
all right , let me show you
some of the features of the room .
first , windows .
conventional .
open , closed .
open , closed .
halfway open .
or halfway closed , depending on your philosophical bent .
over here is my comic book collection . feel free to browse .
there &apos;s a box of disposable reading gloves
on the night stand .
good to know .
in here , you &apos;ll find emergency provisions .
an eight @-@ day supply of food and water , a crossbow ,
season 2 of star trek the original series on a high @-@ density flash drive .
what if there &apos;s a disaster that destroys all the usb ports ?
then there &apos;s really no reason to live , is there ?
can i ask a question about your roommate ?
he &apos;s an odd duck , isn &apos;t he ?
what &apos;s his relationship status ?
well , there was a misbegotten adventure
with a waitress who lives across the hall .
it ended as inexplicably as it began .
they had very little in common ,
except for carnal activity .
that &apos;s why i acquired
these noise @-@ canceling headphones .
if you decide to use them ,
please clean the ear pieces afterwards
with the wet wipes you &apos;ll find in the bathroom .
they &apos;re in the drawer labeled &quot; wet wipes . &quot;
okay .
good . i &apos;ll leave you to your nighttime ablutions .
i &apos;ve e @-@ mailed you the morning bathroom schedule .
you &apos;ll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet .
it &apos;s on the back of the emergency escape route diagram .
how thoughtful .
sleep well , my friend .
you , too .
oh , let me just get one thing .
it &apos;s my backup emergency supply kit .
the living room escape route doesn &apos;t pass through here .
now , good night .
and if there &apos;s an apocalypse , good luck .
yes ?
i saw your light on .
is everything all right ?
yeah , i just couldn &apos;t sleep .
me neither .
oh , look what i &apos;m reading .
it &apos;s you .
i thought you already read it .
i did , but it &apos;s been a while ,
and i wanted to sound smart over breakfast .
aw , you &apos;re smart .
oh , good .
wasn &apos;t sure it was coming across .
what chapter are you on ?
uh , six .
oh , the extragalactic distance ladder .
want to know a little secret ?
sure .
i wrote the section on the wilson @-@ bappu effect completely naked .
really ?
uh , sure doesn &apos;t read that way .
here , let me show you .
when we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars ,
we start to see a possible explanation
for some of the discrepancies found in hubble &apos;s constant .
you really make science come alive .
vocal test . morning vocal test .
second vocal test .
second morning vocal test .
morning , sheldon .
morning .
morning , sheldon .
morning .
i trust you had a pleasant night .
more than pleasant .
excuse me , i &apos;m going to relieve myself .
how do you take your coffee ?
black .
okeydoke .
pee for houston , pee for austin ,
pee for the state my heart got lost in .
and shake twice for texas .
something his mother taught him .
all right , elizabeth , the bathroom is yours .
the seat is down , and has been sanitized for your protection .
that &apos;s very thoughtful , but i think i &apos;ll finish my coffee first .
ah , so the yogurt didn &apos;t work .
i &apos;ll fire off a critical e @-@ mail to the manufacturer .
oh , good , you &apos;re up . look , my car won &apos;t start .
i need a ride to work .
did you once again ignore your &quot; check engine &quot; light ?
no , mr. smarty @-@ pants .
i ignored the &quot; fill gas tank &quot; light .
leonard , penny wants to exploit any
residual feelings you have for her
in order to get a ride to work .
oh , yeah , sure , let me just put this in a travel mug .
hello .
hi .
oh , penny , this is dr. plimpton ...
a leading expert on quantum cosmology .
dr. plimpton , penny is a waitress
who doesn &apos;t understand the role gasoline plays
in the internal combustion engine .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
are you enjoying your stay ?
yes , very much .
good .
wonderful . meaningless pleasantries accomplished .
elizabeth , leonard &apos;s bathroom time is coming up ,
and believe me , you do not want to follow him .
excuse me .
okay , well , i guess i should get dressed
so i can take everyone to work .
you and sheldon
and sheldon &apos;s friend ,
dr. plimpton , who you just met .
gonna be fun .
like a clown car .
hang on . hmm ?
yeah ? what ? huh ?
we just broke up .
wha ... uh , you and me ? yeah , we did .
not too long ago .
how are you doing with it ?
not as good as you apparently .
i , um , i don &apos;t follow .
you know what ? it &apos;s , it &apos;s none of my business .
if you want to sleep with sheldon &apos;s doctor buddy
right after we stopped seeing each other , go for it .
excuse me .
i &apos;m uncomfortable with you recommending
that leonard pursue having intercourse with dr. plimpton ,
who i assure you has better things to do .
i &apos;m not recommending it .
i &apos;m saying it already happened .
that &apos;s preposterous .
tell her , leonard .
well ...
no .
come on . it wasn &apos;t my fault .
the implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts ?
you know what ? i &apos;m just gonna take the bus to work .
penny , i can still drive you .
oh , no , no , it &apos;s okay .
you might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant .
i must say , i &apos;m shocked by this betrayal .
i didn &apos;t betray penny .
not penny , me !
how am i betraying you ?
elizabeth &apos;s my friend , and you &apos;re playing with her !
yeah , i guess i did .
what the hell are you doing ?
relax , it &apos;s nyquil .
you still have a cold ?
maybe , but i don &apos;t care .
that &apos;s the great thing about nyquil , it &apos;s like ten @-@ percent booze .
i call it the nighttime sniffling , sneezing , coughing
so you can talk to girls medicine .
are you having trouble sleeping ?
&apos;cause , boy , i was up all night .
did you get a cold , too ?
no , but i was awake all night .
if you want ,
i can give you some of my mom &apos;s sleeping pills .
she won &apos;t notice they &apos;re missing ?
she doesn &apos;t know she takes them .
no , that &apos;s okay .
it was something else keeping me up last night .
and again this morning .
and ... i didn &apos;t mind .
i was up last night .
i was up this morning .
i didn &apos;t mind .
those are your clues .
did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies ?
no .
were you up making another stop @-@ motion lego movie ?
no .
&apos;cause let me tell you ,
it &apos;s not enough to make the legos move ,
they also have to capture your heart .
okay , i &apos;ll give you one more clue .
it involved another person .
did you get a japanese love pillow ?
how is a japanese love pillow another person ?
it is if you love her and give her a name .
dr. plimpton , i &apos;d like you to meet my colleagues--
dr. rajesh koothrappali
and not @-@ a @-@ doctor howard wolowitz .
i &apos;m a big fan of your work .
thank you .
and of course , you &apos;ve already introduced yourself to dr. hofstadter .
hey , you .
hey , you .
boy , i &apos;m kind of tuckered out .
how are you feeling , elizabeth ?
you know what ?
i am a little tired .
would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee ?
sure .
black , right ?
actually , now i think i want it hot , brown and sweet .
coming right up .
what ?
what do you mean &quot; what ? &quot; it &apos;s halo night .
i can &apos;t . i &apos;m too sick .
go away .
that &apos;s why we moved halo night here .
look , i brought my mom &apos;s chicken soup .
i &apos;m not hungry .
don &apos;t send him away .
let him in .
who &apos;s that ?
i bought a parrot .
yeah , right .
dr. plimpton ?
hi . howard , right ?
uh , yeah .
can i ask you a question , howard ?
do you like role @-@ playing games ?
yeah , sure .
in fact , i &apos;m a dungeon master .
not tonight .
tonight you are a delivery man .
you brought soup ,
but uh @-@ oh , raj and i don &apos;t have enough money to pay you .
so we &apos;ll have to come to some other kind of arrangement .
beg your pardon ?
you two figure out the details ,
i &apos;m going to go change into something
i don &apos;t mind getting ripped off my milky flesh .
what the frak ?
go away .
she wants new delhi , not kosher deli .
besides , you have a girlfriend .
we broke up weeks ago .
why didn &apos;t you say anything ?
i was waiting for the right time .
this is the right time .
hey , who &apos;s ready for halo ?
oh , this is like a nightmare .
get lost !
he &apos;s right . the numbers are shaky enough as it is .
i don &apos;t understand .
oh , good.leonard &apos;s here .
good ? !
elizabeth ? what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is you and howard are my moving men
and raj is my new landlord
and i don &apos;t have enough money to pay any of you .
is she suggesting what i think she &apos;s suggesting ?
yep .
welcome to the penthouse forum .
okay , show of hands . who &apos;s up for this ?
we &apos;ll all be naked in front of each other .
i &apos;m out .
everybody ready ?
follow my lead .
almost .
we &apos;re , we &apos;re going to go out into the hallway and ,
make a dramatic entrance .
oh , good . it &apos;s so much better when everyone commits .
run . run , run , run . don &apos;t look back .
i thought we had something special .
so , you say you can &apos;t pay your rent ...
oh , leonard ?
i found these in the dryer .
i &apos;m assuming they belong to sheldon .
thanks .
it &apos;s really hard to find these in his size .
so , listen .
i &apos;ve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning .
you mean you and dr. slutbunny ?
yeah , i wanted to explain .
well , you don &apos;t owe me an explanation .
i don &apos;t ?
no , you don &apos;t .
so , you are not judging me .
i &apos;m judging you nine ways to sunday .
but you don &apos;t own me an explanation .
nevertheless , i &apos;d like to get one on the record ,
so you can understand why i did what i did .
i &apos;m listening .
