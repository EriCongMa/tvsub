after a trauma ,
your body is at its most vulnerable .
response time is critical .
so you &apos;re suddenly surrounded by people ...
go . go . you got it .
doctors , nurses ...
focus . focus .
come on , come on , come on .
specialists , technicians .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . go .
surgery is a team sport ...
everyone pushing for the finish line ...
all right ! all right ! good job .
yay , fingers .
yeah . yeah .
putting you back together again .
okay . it &apos;s okay .
you &apos;re retraining your brain .
getting your fingers straight
was the goal for today , okay ?
mm @-@ hmm .
little goals , remember ?
all right , let me get in there to check her incision .
good morning . baby report . boom .
i &apos;m gonna go see her .
hey . you &apos;re awesome .
oh , gimme , gimme , gimme .
see ?
she &apos;s moving her arm like she &apos;s waving .
she still doesn &apos;t open her eyes ,
but she only stopped breathing once last night . and get this--
her brain bleed &apos;s still grade 1 .
good girl .
she looks bigger .
is she bigger ?
all right . some of us are still working .
let me get in there , please .
okay , i have a consult . i have to go .
how are you ?
um ... i almost got my hand straight .
that &apos;s great .
yeah .
but surgery is a trauma in and of itself .
so today ? i can see her today ?
and once it &apos;s over , the real healing begins .
we call it recovery .
i &apos;m sorry .
no .
but until ...
no .
you can be mobilized ,
and your infections are completely gone ,
you cannot see her ,
and she cannot leave the nicu .
now you know
i would if i could .
right ? you know that--
recovery is not a team sport .
yang .
tell her i would .
she would if she could .
it &apos;s a solitary distance run .
are you giving me the finger ?
yes , i am .
good job .
it &apos;s long , it &apos;s exhausting ...
and it &apos;s lonely as hell .
mrs. pulcher , you &apos;re gonna have to stop smoking .
your infections are getting worse .
your infections , you mean .
i didn &apos;t have them before you two idiots operated .
and you didn &apos;t even do that right .
again , i am sorry , but your lung cancer
had spread to the point that we couldn &apos;t--
please . useless .
i can afford any hospital in the world ,
and i come to this third @-@ rate crap factory .
when am i getting outta here ?
i &apos;ve been here for three weeks .
this is not guantanamo .
discharge her , please . i &apos;ll pay you .
there is not much more that we can do
unless you are willing to help yourself . now the smoking--
oh , if i wanted a lecture on smoking ,
i &apos;d dig up my dead husband .
now get me outta here before i sue your balls off .
well , we &apos;ll run some tests ,
and if your white blood cell count
is up to an acceptable level--
how high does it have to be ?
give me a number .
well , it &apos;s at a 0.8 now , and i &apos;d like it to be above a 2 .
1 .
this is not a negotiation .
everything is . 1.5 .
1.5 and you let me outta here .
now get me a wheelchair ,
&apos;cause if i have to wait around this hellhole ,
i &apos;m gonna smoke .
okay .
ooh . i smoothed out some bumps in the nicu surgery protocol
if you wanna ... stop acting like a child .
you crushed his heart ,
april , and none of us thought he had one ,
so that &apos;s impressive .
yeah , well , it &apos;s inconvenient .
i need him to sign this .
uh , morning .
oh , good morning .
oh , uh , another alzheimer &apos;s trial patient today , huh ?
yes , sir .
good , good .
how is your islet cell trial going ?
have you found a resident to assist you ?
uh , yeah . uh , avery &apos;s gonna help me out today .
great . good .
and , uh , mrs. webber , how is she feeling ?
uh , she &apos;s doing all right . thank-- thank you .
oh , sir .
you ...
wow . that kid looks screwed .
he is .
he has five different cardiac and abdominal defects .
i &apos;m supposed to operate on him next week .
that &apos;s awesome . can i scrub in ?
yeah , if you can get us to africa .
i was supposed to go back there next week ,
but now i have a very sick little girl of my own
and a fiance in the i.c.u.
fly him out here .
yeah , i &apos;ve tried , but you can &apos;t imagine the red tape
and the money .
and there &apos;s a dozen more like him
that i &apos;d want to do the same thing for .
i &apos;m trying to find someone to help &apos; em out over there .
i just ... i made a promise , that &apos;s all .
hey , it &apos;s healing pretty well ,
and maybe in a couple of days ,
you can try sitting up by yourself .
let &apos;s try now .
can &apos;t rush it .
why &apos;d i get you ?
why aren &apos;t you cutting out a heart somewhere ?
well , altman and i had a falling out ,
over your ventricular septal defect , actually .
mm . i &apos;m just giving her some space .
okay , you &apos;re good . okay , you need anything ?
i need to see my baby .
she &apos;s mostly tubes and wires .
and she looks more like a chicken than a baby ...
like a-- like a featherless , beakless chicken .
you want to wait till she &apos;s cuter .
you &apos;re the worst godmother ever .
you picked me .
she opened her eyes .
sofia-- she-- she looked right at me .
i saw her sweet little eyes . they-- they &apos;re beautiful .
they look just like yours . oh , my god !
i shoulda taken pictures . why didn &apos;t i do that ?
oh , no . oh , no . oh , god , no . i &apos;m so sorry .
go , go , go , go , get the pictures !
okay .
go get the pictures then .
i &apos;m sorry . oh , oh , god .
callie .
callie .
no , don &apos;t . callie .
callie , stop it . stop it . stop it , callie !
you &apos;ll rupture your sutures .
i am missing her .
i know .
i &apos;m missing her .
i know . i know , honey . i know .
she could die , and i &apos;ll never--
i could miss her whole life !
okay , okay . easy , easy , relax .
lie back down .
pulse is 102 .
are you nervous , ed ?
yeah ,
it &apos;s kinda like going to the dentist , only worse .
well , this is gonna be
over before you even know it starts .
mm @-@ hmm .
dr. grey is gonna do the drill now .
you &apos;re not gonna feel anything , though .
ed , try and relax , okay ?
i can &apos;t .
all right , stop . stop it . just pull back .
all right . let &apos;s get the halo off . he &apos;s having an m.i.
okay .
flatline .
what the hell happened ?
his e.k.g. was fine ?
he never complained of chest pain .
i did the workup . there was nothing in his history .
it wasn &apos;t your fault . it was a massive m.i.
after we inform mr. beckert &apos;s family ,
i will call the f.d.a. and file a formal report .
is there a chance they could shut down the trial ?
oh , it doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;m gonna shut it down , pending the autopsy .
i want to know why we didn &apos;t see it coming .
i thought dr.bailey said torres can &apos;t be moved yet .
yes , sir , but since she has had no contact with the baby ,
i was wondering how soon we might be able to--
bring the baby totorres ?
i think it &apos;ll do the both of them good .
uh , if i could at least tell dr.torres when she--
when the baby is off the vent ,
when she has an immune system
and can withstand the onslaught of deadly infections
dr. torres would threaten her with , that &apos;s when .
i mean , come on . i &apos;m all for mother / baby bonding ,
but not when it &apos;ll kill the baby .
why do you even ask me these things , huh ?
i thought you were a doctor .
i need your help with something .
oh , wait . i have , uh , patient 122 &apos;s trial packet .
it was never opened , so it needs to go back into the lot .
oh , okay . one sec .
i heard about your patient . i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
have a good night .
you , too .
henry , will you open the door ?
i &apos;m sorry . the place is , uh ...
you were just supposed to tell me if this is normal or if i need to--
if need to go to the hospital .
all right . you know what ? will you just sit down and be quiet ?
did you check your blood sugar ?
uh , 56 , but i don &apos;t have , uh , any juice .
i just have , uh , half a can of diet soda , so--
okay , okay .
oh , damn it . look at you .
what ?
you look amazing .
you were on a date , weren &apos;t you ?
i made you come here in the middle of a date .
no , no , no , you know what ? actually ,
you saved me from the longest date with the most tedious man .
the only good thing that came out of the date were these cannolis ,
which , as it turns out , is exactly
what someone needs when they &apos;re having a hypoglycemic episode .
but you still shouldn &apos;t have come .
yeah , you know what ? you &apos;ll stop saying that once you try this .
okay . yeah .
good .
okay . tell me about this date .
uh , well , mm , his name is erwin .
okay , so strike one .
no !
give me that .
so am i leaving ? what &apos;s my number ?
it &apos;s not good .
not your opinion , stupid . number .
0.6 .
it &apos;s gone down .
i &apos;m sorry the results weren &apos;t better .
you should be , you worthless bastard .
it &apos;s all your fault . get outta my sight .
i can &apos;t stand looking at your stupid face .
go !
how &apos;d she take it , karev ?
bitchy , cause she &apos;s a bitch .
she &apos;s also dying and she &apos;s alone .
she hasn &apos;t had any family or visitors since she got here .
well , maybe that &apos;s cause she &apos;s--
let &apos;s keep our assessments to ourselves .
karev , what &apos;s your plan for chief resident ?
my plan ?
mm @-@ hmm , besides badmouthing patients .
all your colleagues are showing some kind of leadership potential .
grey and avery , they &apos;re on clinical trials ,
kepner is overhauling the surgical checklist .
they have a plan .
i was just wondering if you had a--
african kids .
sorry ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna bring over about a dozen kids from africa
and , uh , get them surgeries-- badly needed surgeries .
huh . sounds pretty ambitious .
well , i &apos;m am ambitious guy .
also sounds like you just pulled that outta your butt .
oh , no , sir , it &apos;s a-- it &apos;s a plan that i &apos;ve , uh , been plan--planning .
okay . well , good .
let me know if i can help .
right outta your butt .
shut up .
you guys ready ? let &apos;s do this .
wake up !
what ?
just lay still and relax . let us do everything .
can you do that ?
tell him that chole moved to 8 : 30 tomorrow .
back , back , back .
okay .
dr. bailey .
can i-- can i ask you something ?
well , what is it ?
uh , h @-@ how &apos;s your day going ?
how &apos;s my day going ?
uh , my day should &apos;ve ended three hours ago .
i &apos;m tired , it &apos;s late ,
and i still have six more things to do before it &apos;s over ,
and now i have you in my face asking me how my day is going .
we &apos;ll give you some privacy .
hi , baby .
don &apos;t worry .
see , i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m a little messed up , too .
but we &apos;re gonna be fine , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna be just fine .
hey , how is mr. beckert &apos;s wife ?
uh , her kids took her home .
i can &apos;t believe they lied to us .
they didn &apos;t lie .
they just left out the history of his heart problems
because they needed this trial .
now while we &apos;re waiting for the f.d.a. to respond ,
i want to rescreen all the applicants with a fine @-@ tooth comb .
is that what you &apos;re doing now ?
no . as morbid as it sounds ,
i am trying to find a replacement for mr. beckert .
a new patient 122 ?
yeah , we &apos;ll need to have one ready .
okay . so what about adele webber ?
meredith , you know i want to ,
but she &apos;s just not far enough along .
her disease has not progressed enough for her to be
eligible for this trial . you know that .
well , this fell off of richard &apos;s sweater this morning .
breathe .
breathe .
no . she can &apos;t talk to me like that .
i &apos;m a trained professional ,
and she &apos;s an uncooperative , insulting--
fiance of mine , so let &apos;s just-- let &apos;s watch it .
he &apos;s a wuss . let him go .
good luck .
that &apos;s the third one this month .
they don &apos;t push me hard enough .
it &apos;s a traumatic brain injury .
it &apos;s not boot camp .
yeah , we &apos;re getting married .
you want me walking down the aisle , not rolling , right ?
i want you healed . it &apos;s okay . i mean , the wedding ...
oh ! sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
the baby won &apos;t wait .
you can pick her up . you can hold the baby .
mark can hold the baby . i can &apos;t hold my baby !
don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s okay !
i &apos;m sorry .
then bring me those balls , please .
i &apos;ve got , eight patients lined up
from three african countries ,
all through the namboze clinic .
there &apos;s a , um ... oh , wait .
jeez . ah , here .
a cardiac defect , uh , a brain tumor ,
an idiopathic gangrene case--
i mean , when do we get to see that , right ?
what else ? oh , and , uh , hunt ,
he got me in touch with , a military guy about ground transport .
and he also volunteered to operate pro bono ,
so i &apos;ve got him and robbins , bailey ,
sloan , shepherd ...
stop .
how you gonna pay for all this ?
well , that &apos;s why i &apos;m talking to you .
you &apos;re the chief of-- of peds surgery .
i mean , they &apos;re incredible surgeries ... on kids .
oh , okay . so it &apos;s coming out of my budget ?
well , i &apos;m saying , if i do all the logistical crap ,
i mean , it &apos;s a project the hospital should fund , right ?
i mean , it &apos;s worth ...
nothing .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s worth . no , no .
i &apos;m sorry .
right . i should &apos;ve known what you &apos;d say .
no , no , no . you don &apos;t get to do that .
you don &apos;t get to ask me to fund a plan this half @-@ assed
and then paint me as somebody
who wants to deny health care to third @-@ world kids .
come on .
i mean , yeah , there are people that can do this sort of thing ,
but ... you &apos;re not one of &apos; em .
mrs. pulcher .
is it two hours already ?
it seems like i saw your slack jaw a minute ago .
i feel like i just saw your blistery old butt .
oh , no . you can &apos;t speak to me like that .
you can &apos;t speak to me like that .
i should sue you-- 10 grand for every bedsore on my ass .
i &apos;ll die before i ever see any of that money , but i &apos;ll--
but you &apos;ll die rich .
richer thanks to you dumbasses .
or you could do something good with the money .
donate it to a good cause , help someone out .
or put it to getting you a medical degree .
mrs. pulcher ,
i have a plan to bring some african kids over here
for some really cool--
i mean ... desperately needed surgeries .
you askin &apos; me for money ?
i need at least 100 grand to get things started .
oh , my god .
take it somewhere else , sally struthers ,
and get outta my face .
overall , adele scored a 23 , which is a marked decline
from the last time we tested her , which was 27 .
so she &apos;s definitely a lot worse than we thought .
well , the upside is , she gets in the trial .
but she &apos;s declining so fast .
i know .
why can &apos;t we just give her the medicine on the side
outside of the trial ? who would know ?
no . the f.d.a. is gonna be on us harder than ever .
anything we do that taints the results
could ruin the trial ,
and not to mention our careers along with it .
don &apos;t think i haven &apos;t thought about it .
she &apos;s in heart failure .
she &apos;s gotta go back on the vent .
she needs surgery now ?
well , as soon as possible .
her ductus arteriosus hasn &apos;t closed .
fletcher &apos;s a no @-@ go .
i &apos;m gonna try terry lennox at seattle pres .
look , i know i &apos;m not high on your list ,
but , uh , your baby &apos;s out of time , you know it can &apos;t be you .
i have performed the procedure before , so ...
you &apos;re stuck with me .
i understand . i ...
and , although ,
you &apos;re not technically related to the baby ,
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
the hospital would have no ethical objection
if i let you be in the o.r. with me .
i mean , if you &apos;d like to look over my shoulder ,
you know , make you feel any better .
thank you .
okay . we will page you when we &apos;re ready .
thanks .
i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll go tell callie .
so should i get her prepped ?
yeah , looks like i &apos;m stuck with you , too , huh ?
are you ready to go back ?
one more lap .
what , did you lose a bet ?
she &apos;s my new physical therapist
because she does what i tell her to .
whose charts are those ?
altman &apos;s . she &apos;s being ridiculous .
i haven &apos;t seen a cardio surgery in a month .
so you stole her charts ?
yes , i stole her charts ,
so i will be prepared when she comes crawling back .
grey , sit . i need the resistance .
so i retested adele webber .
she &apos;s worse than we thought .
but at least she &apos;s gonna get in the trial .
okay , see ? ! see ? ! i should be on this .
how do i even have a shot at chief resident
if i can &apos;t do what i &apos;m good at ?
alex , you didn &apos;t . you &apos;re gonna be fired .
i &apos;m gonna be chief resident .
yeah , not if you don &apos;t work here anymore .
he solicited a patient for money .
oh , you hookin &apos; now ?
no , my african kid thing .
it &apos;s against so many rules .
who cares ? the old hag could die ,
leaving her money to save dying children .
but instead , she &apos;ll probably leave it to her cats ,
who probably hate her , too . are you going to radiology ?
uh , hey , everybody . off . now .
callie .
i did four laps today .
sofia needs surgery .
what ?
today . now . she has weakness in her left ventricle .
she needs a p.d.a. ligation .

callie .
oh , god . oh , god .
oh , my ... help !

abdominal wound dehiscence with a small evisceration .
she &apos;s worked herself into a rupture .
i should &apos;ve seen this coming .
i should &apos;ve forced her to stop walking .
i check that wound three times a day .
she never complained of pain .
yang ,
i &apos;ve been telling torres to slow down for weeks .
the woman doesn &apos;t listen ,
so stop kicking yourself and just help me fix it .
bovie .
how bad does it look ?
how is she ?
they &apos;re just starting now .
b.p.i. &apos; s , uh , 39 over 20 .
that &apos;s way too low .

you know , talking will distract me .
i &apos;m sorry . i have to hang up .
no , i didn &apos;t say hang up . just keep it down , please . potts .
you &apos;re dumber than you look .
i &apos;m gonna have your job .

its small features and oversized eyes
trigger a hormonal response in humans .

she &apos;s--she &apos;s been watched by doctors 24 hours a day .
she still will .
okay , well , her lungs-- she could get r.s.v ..
well , any kid could get r.s.v ..
she &apos;s not getting in a car . it &apos;s not safe .
some wounds might never fully heal ...

okay , neither are bookcases ,
or squirrels , uh , strong winds ,
uh , people who sneeze .
they &apos;re all gonna get your baby .
but , honey ,
you don &apos;t feel this way because you were in an accident .
you feel this way because you are a parent .
it &apos;ll pass , mostly .
some of it never will .
you might have to adjust to a whole new way of living .
things may have changed too radically ...
