第一季 第四集
daddy !
when i was a child ,
my father was framed for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
amanda !
amanda clarke no longer exists .
before he died , he left a roadmap for revenge
that led me to the people who destroyed our lives .
i want to make this right .
then you never should &apos;ve slept with my best friend .
the &quot; amanda &quot; ?
sammy named her .
looking over dad &apos;s will .
the stowaway is all ours now .
tyler barrol , daniel &apos;s roommate at harvard .
you &apos;re perfectly welcome to make yourself at home
at the pool house .
thank you , mrs. grayson .
only thing missing is you .
call me sometime .
no matter what happens between us ,
always be honest with you .
most of the memories i have from childhood
are happy ones .
warm summer days filled with love and light .
and the certainty
that even the darkest storm would eventually pass .
and for a while , at least ,
they always did .
and then ?
and then ...
my parents &apos; car ...
went off a cliff
and ...
they were both killed .
but you were not .
no .
i survived .
clearly it &apos;s ...
this early exposure to impermanence .
that makes it so difficult for you to trust
in your adult relationships .
but how do i get past that ?
i mean , i really want to ...
move forward with this guy at i was telling you about ,
but ...
i don &apos;t know . i guess i &apos;m just afraid .
emily , we &apos;ve been circling this theme
for a year now .
it &apos;s time for you to stop playing the victim .
time for you to start taking an active role
in your own happiness .
until you do that ,
the only thing you can expect
from this new relationship or any other
is that it will end badly .
okay . think about that for next week .
thank you , dr. banks .
还有 《 基督山伯爵 》 的书 内涵喂
every time i leave here , i feel ...
more and more determined to take control .
good . then it sounds like i &apos;m doing my job .
after over a year of treatment ,
i remain skeptical that emily will ever conquer
her trust issues .
the past continues to define her present ,
and she &apos;s given me no reason to believe
that it won &apos;t define her future as well .
so you &apos;re flat @-@ out denying it ?
that i somehow hijacked your computer
and used it to blackmail tom kingsly ?
yes , conrad , i am denying it .
it &apos;s no secret how much you despise the senator .
and it &apos;s no secret how many people despise you .
you &apos;re hardly one to be
throwing around these kinds of accusations .
besides , anyone could &apos;ve gotten to your laptop .
you leave it all over the place .
now speaking of which ...
do you plan on letting me know where you &apos;re headed ?
san francisco .
ah . business or pleasure ?
sorry to interrupt the good times .
daddy , your car &apos;s here .
thank you , sweetheart .
mm . have a safe trip .
thanks .
i &apos;ll be back before you know it .
good .
i hate it when you &apos;re gone .
not so fast , young lady .
you and i have our dress fittings
for the mother @-@ daughter tea this morning .
that &apos;s not happening . i &apos;m meeting my friends .
you &apos; always meeting your friends .
this charity is important to me .
my friends are important to me .
maybe if you were nicer to yours ,
you &apos;d still have some .
oh , watch it , charlotte .
hey , do me a favor ,
honey , be there for your mother on this .
when i get back , we can go sailing .
you can tell me about how horrible it was .
ugh . fine .
love you .
thanks for the support .
yes !
whoo ! next stop wimbledon .
uh , pretty sure the ball was out .
i &apos;m pretty sure you &apos;re lying .
ah , accept defeat , tyler .
never . good game . all right .
well , what &apos;s say we all order lunch from the grill and ,
uh , hit the pool , uh ?
if only .
some of us have to work for a living .
there &apos;s still heaps to prepare
for victoria &apos;s charity tea .
cucumber sandwiches and scones . there .
you &apos;re done .
tell that to your mother .
she has me in charge of everything .
i rely want to wow her .
well , then how about we all hit club tonight , huh ?
yeah , not me .
uh , i &apos;m trying to stay off the club circuit this summer .
and we have plans . remember ?
i &apos;m cooking you dinner .
yes . of course .
i &apos;m looking forward to it .
but you should go , ash .
well , it just so happens , i &apos;m free .
perfect .
call you later ?
sooner &apos;s better .
bye .
bye .
look who &apos;s whipped .
contents of dad &apos;s safe deposit box .
i thought those things were supposed to be for valuables .
where &apos;s the cash ?
right here .
&quot; first dollar ever made at the stowaway . 1979 . &quot;
yeah , it &apos;s mom &apos;s wedding ring .
she must have given it back before she took off on him .
all right . that could be worth something .
well , i say we hang on to the family heirlooms .
yeah ? does that include the bar ?
yeah , we should talk about that .
what &apos;s there to talk about ? sell it .
i &apos;ll be 18 in a few months ,
and i could use that money to get a place in town ,
finishchool , and you--
you could finally sail off to haiti .
you don &apos;t want to come with me ?
ah , i kinda got another adventure in mind .
what are you talng about , the rich girl ?
all right . i &apos;ll tell you what .
i &apos;ll run the numbers .
we &apos;ll see what we can get for the place
once the loan &apos;s paid off .
okay .
i mean , it could mean a whole new future for us .
i know .
the future depresses me .
why is that ?
because i can &apos;t see things improving .
one minute conrad &apos;s wanting to repair the damage ,
and the next moment he &apos;s inflicting it .
how so ?
by accusing me of ridiculous things
that aren &apos;t even worth mentioning .
infidelity ?
he knows better than to try that one
after his recent track record .
what are you thinking about ?
the past .
if i promise to be good ,
will you please let me see my dad ?
no ,
because you &apos;d only be pretending to be good ...
just like your dad pretended to be a good father .
he was a good father .
you know the truth .
please don &apos;t leave me in here .
i promise , i &apos;ll be a good girl .
you &apos;d just be pretending .
people who aren &apos;t who they claim to be ,
amanda , are very , very dangerous .
you would be wise to remember that .
no !
please don &apos;t leave me .
help me out !
get me out !
today we celebrate the ongoing efforts
of mothers and daughters united for &quot; peace of mind ... &quot;
a unique charity benefiting mental health care ...
still have your nose to the grindstone , i see .
how &apos;s it coming ?
it &apos;s not can burn .
but it took the heart strings .
nice . connect those heart strings to the purse strings .
emily .
i didn &apos;t know you were helping ashley on this .
oh , no . this is all ash .
i came to see daniel .
of course you did .
though i did purchase a ticket to your tea ,
in memory of my mother .
well , that &apos;s touching .
and when i heard that dr. banks was speaking
i was just ... i knew i just ...
i had to have a friend role seat .
and how do you know michelle ?
i &apos;ve been seeing her for a year or so .
she is helping through a few things .
mm . well , you &apos;re in good hands .
so i imagine i &apos;ll be se you at the tea then .
i wouldn &apos;t miss it .
hey , handsome .
oops . thought you were daniel .
ah . i &apos;m sorry to disappoint .
i was just on my way to the fish market .
thought i &apos;d see how daniel felt about rock shrimp .
ooh . danny &apos;s allergic to shellfish .
good thing i was here .
you coulda killed the guy .
you sure know a lot about him .
yeah , well , best friends are like that .
right . harvard boys .
so where are you from exactly ?
exactly ?
nowhere anymore .
my family has estates all over the map .
oh ... danny tells me you &apos;re an orphan .
that sucks .
money can buy a lot of things ,
but family isn &apos;t one of them .
well , family can be overrated .
so , uh , what time do you want him ?
7 : 00 , 8 : 00 ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll just give him a call .
see ya .
did i just hear emily ?
yeah . she just took off .
she said that something &apos;s come up
and she had to cancel dinner .
seriously ? did she say why ?
nope .
sorry .
okay , so even after the estate tax ,
my dad &apos;s life insurance leaves us with a decent chunk of change .
it &apos;s the dog @-@ napper .
hi . what are you two doing here ?
i &apos;m getting a little financial advice .
some ... i &apos;m thinking about selling the bar .
what do you think ?
i think it &apos;s none of our business , nolan .
i think he should do what he wants .
well , what he wants
is to use his father &apos;s insurance money
buy a boat , sail to haiti ,
and never come back .
well , like i said , it &apos;s his choice .
and he already has a boat .
he sold the boat .
he being me .
nolan owns the &quot; amanda &quot; now .
mm . funny story , actually .
well , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll do
what &apos;s best for you and sammy .
bye .
bye .
jack and emily sitting in a tree .
really ?
kinda .
it worked .
you smiled .
are you always in a good mood ?
yeah , when i , uh , when i see you .
your ring &apos;s pretty girlie , don &apos;t you think ?
uh , this ? yeah . uh ...
this was my mother &apos;s ,
and i &apos;m gonna go see how much it &apos;s worth .
you &apos;d sell your mom &apos;s wedding ring ?
trust me , there &apos;s really no sentimental value .
charlotte ?
the seamstress is ready .
momzilla .
hi , mrs. grayson .
i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m declan porter .
sorry to interrupt , but she has a fitting right now .
oh , yeah ? okay , that &apos;s cool ,
&apos;cause , uh , me , too , you know .
it &apos;s a big day of fittings .
see you around , charlotte .
the things you &apos;ll do to torture me .
it &apos;s not always about you , mom .
hey , you &apos;ve reached daniel .
leave a message and i &apos;ll call you back .
hey , it &apos;s almost 9 : 30,
and i &apos;m officially worried .
where are you ? call me .
emily .
it &apos;s about time .
that &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s what i was thinking on the way over here .
hi .
these are from sammy ,
as a way of saying thank you for bringing him home last week ...
twice .
well , that &apos;s very nice of sammy , but--
oh . i should &apos;ve called first .
you &apos;re in the middle of something .
yes , i am in the middle of something ,
and that happens to be an exceptionally good bottle of pinot .
do you drink wine ?
well , when it &apos;s exceptional ,
sure .
cheers .
so have you made any decisions ?
about the bar , i mean .
actually , i &apos;m , uh ,
i &apos;m gonna hold on to it for now .
postpone any major decisions till the end of the season .
why is that ?
well , i guess i &apos;m ...
just hoping to find
a really good reason to stick around .
a better reason than the stowaway ?
if i &apos;m lucky .
michelle .
oh . everything is exquisite .
but i &apos;ve come to expect nothing less from you .
oh , thank you . well , it takes a village , right ?
the narration you did for the video presentation is perfect .
oh , i &apos;m happy to do my part for the cause .
oh , michelle , you know miriam and everly .
oh , she ought to . i &apos;m in her office once a week .
oh , excuse me .
charlotte ,
the presentation is about to begin ,
and i need you here by my side right now .
please do not disappoint me today , i beg of you .
do you understand ?
wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
thank you .
hey , ash .
is everything okay ?
no , everything is definitely not okay .
i &apos;m as hungover as a french sailor ,
and now i &apos;ve lost the bloody dvd .
okay . well , don &apos;t worry . i &apos;ll help you .
it was right here .
did you check the dvd play ?
no .
found it .
thank you . i am never dinking again .
i take it that you and tyler had a good time ?
mm . too much . he is a madman .
how was dinner with daniel ?
it wasn &apos;t . i got stood up .
and now he &apos;s not answering his phone .
you &apos;re kidding . prince charming ?
something must have happened .
i &apos;m sure , but we can talk about that later
because you have some dazzling to do .
excuse me .
oh , great . now i &apos;m hallucinating .
i &apos;ll handle him .
i &apos;m getting pretty sick of you
sticking your nose where it doesn &apos;t belong , nolan .
i know you &apos;ve been whispering in jack porter &apos;s ear .
don &apos;t involve him in this .
i heard you two had a perfectly lovely evening
and ...
nice to know you can let your guard down once in a while .
who knew you could cook ?
good afternoon , ladies ,
and welcome to the 15th annual mother @-@ daughter tea .
show &apos;s starting .
correct me if i &apos;m wrong ,
but i ... smell the distinct aroma
of retribution in the air .
as you know , today &apos;s event ...
mothers and daughters only .
oh , there you are .
have you seen my cell phone anywhere ?
oh , i have seen many a thing
the last 24 hours , my friend .
your phone is not among them .
you and ashley party it up ?
oh , yes .
but she had that tea thing this morning ,
so i cashed her out early ,
and somehow ended up in the back of a limo
with half a dozen real housewives .
by the time i sobered up ,
i was in friggin &apos; newark .
you were definitely missed .
sounds like you did just fine without me .
mm . you , uh ...
did you ever connect with emily ?
uh , no , i did not .
after you left , i went over to find out why she canceled ,
and get this--
she &apos;s over there with some other guy .
yeah , not the first time i &apos;ve seen him hanging around , either .
what a bitch .
if it helps ,
i smelled that one coming a mile away .
doesn &apos;t help .
well , maybe this will .
oh , come on . the daniel grayson i know
drinks this kind of thing off
and moves on to the next in line .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think so .
let me ask you something .
when &apos;s the last time you woke up craving drink ?
uh , never .
that &apos;s because , despite what mommy and daddy say ,
you &apos;re not an alcoholic .
you &apos;re just a guy that likes to have a good time .
and now you &apos;re unattached again .
so ...
bottoms up .
there we go .
hello , conrad .
may i come in ?
of course .
i see you &apos;ve set yourself up nicely .
thanks to you .
can i get you a drink ?
i have a plane to catch .
then what are you doing here ?
i take it you heard about senator kingsly &apos;s
fund @-@ raiser .
who didn &apos;t ?
seems a little young for her retirement .
ah , well , the retirement wasn &apos;t exactly voluntary .
but you already knew that , didn &apos;t you ?
all i know is that victoria thought
to include my ex @-@ husband on the guest list .
was that to get back at you
or me ?
i don &apos;t know . both , perhaps .
truth is , things have become so ugly between us ,
she seems capable just about anything .
what is clear is that
she &apos;s still very suspicious of you .
and after the way you came at me for that check ,
i guess i was , too .
i should &apos;ve never back you to a corner like that .
hey , victoria backed you into a corner
i don &apos;t blame you for showing your claws .
thanks to the dedicated effort
of founding mother victoria grayson ,
your generous donations today ensure that
low @-@ income special needs children
are provided top @-@ notch
mental health care close to home
and now please enjoy this very special video presentation ,
which illustrates just how vital an effort this is .
today we celebrate
the ongoing efforts of mothers and daughters .
united for &quot; peace of mind , &quot;
a unique charity benefiting
mental health care facilities and--
and have you hit bottle ?
close .
i drove my children to summercamp
loaded on painkills and vodka .
hamptonsexposed .
how can i explaind to my husband
that i slept with his sister ?
he--he &apos;s never gonna forgive
turn it off .
it takes a lot for me to get physical with anybody .
oh , my god .
i just wish i knew for sure that i could trust him .
how &apos;s your relationship with your daughter ?
tense ... distant .
the truth is , i &apos;ve never really
felt close to charlotte .
sometimes i wonder if having a second child
was a mistake .
charlotte , wait .
no . i &apos;m done dressing up
and pretending to be someone i &apos;m not .
you wish i was never born ?
that makes two of us .
victoria , i--
i didn &apos;t--
you recorded my private sessions ?
for my own use .
i am going to destroy you .
someone must have--i--
i am going to ruin you !
victoria , i ... i don &apos;t ...
did she just threaten her ?
did you hear it , too ?
collect those recordings
and get them to me by the end of the day ,
or i swear to god , michelle ,
i will not only sue you ,
i will make you suffer
every single day for the rest of your miseble life !
you gotta think clearly , victoria .
it &apos;s not in your best interest
to leave threatening voice mails .
that woman can expose far worse than
my troubled relationship
with charlotte .
like what ?
what does she know ?
too much .
okay , victoria .
don &apos;t go anywhere . don &apos;t speak to anyone .
i &apos;ll be back in an hour .
i &apos;ve known amanda clarke &apos;s family
for quite some time , and ...
with her father &apos;s arrest for that horrible crime ,
i think it &apos;s best for everyone involved
that amanda be institutionalized .
well , i &apos;ll be the to make that determination .
of course , doctor .
i imagine how difficult it must be for you
to handle cases like this .
they &apos;re-- they &apos;re heartbreaking .
it &apos;s the job .
what if you had a different kind of job ?
what if i offered you a private practice
with a steady stream of the right kind of clients ?
i could be your first patient .
in return ,
you see to it that amanda gets the care she needs
in a proper institution .
but more importantly ,
that she and her father remain separated for good .
what &apos;s your best price ?
i already told you .
what &apos;s going on ?
sweet , huh ?
i was just thinking , for when i get my share of the bar ,
i could , uh--
i &apos;m sorry to put you out , man .
we &apos;re not buying . come here .
what are you doing ? what &apos;s the big deal ?
the big deal , declan , is you &apos;re not even 18 yet ,
so you &apos;re not even legally able to drive that thing ,
and secondly , and more importantly ,
i &apos;m putting a pin in the plans to sell the bar .
since when is that your decision ?
what , i @-@ i don &apos;t get a say ?
i &apos;m the adult here , declan .
and i &apos;m your guardian , so , no , you don &apos;t .
we &apos;ll talk about it again at the end of the summer
when i gety boat back .
that &apos;s forever .
you &apos;ll be fine .
oh , what the hell are we doing in this dump , huh ?
you &apos;re emily &apos;s friend , right ?
jack .
you lookin &apos; for emily ?
we &apos;re just looking for a good time , jack .
i take it there &apos;s no cover tonight .
come on , danny .
excuse me . bartender , could we get a drink ?
you have really outdone yourself .
your hamptonsexposed link
is a work of art .
and sliding your own therapy session into the mix
to throw suspicion ...
genius .
i mirrored the site
and posted a few clones
just to make sure it never dies .
thank you .
now go befo someo sees you .
victoria watches this place like a hawk .
i also did some , uh ,
research into your collateral damage .
seems dr. banks wasn &apos;t always
the go @-@ to shrink for the rich and demented .
she began her road to infamy
as a court @-@ appointed child psychologist .
random coincidence ?
nothing &apos;s random , nolan .
well ...
you can be satisfied the good doctor will ...
never practice again .
count on it .
charlotte &apos;s phone . leave a message .
charlotte , darling , what you heard today
was taken completely out of context
by someone who has a vicious agenda against me .
please ...
come home the instant you hear this message .
southampton police .
are you victoria grayson ?
yes .
i &apos;m detective robert gunther , southampton police department .
this is my associate here , officer gibbs .
m @-@ my god . is it my daughter ?
this is about michelle banks .
what happened ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;d like to find out .
we need to ask you a few questions .
may we come in ?
yes .
several witnesses confirmed
that you publicly threated dr. banks .
hours later , she placed a call to 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 from her office ,
which we found ransacked .
i threaten to ruin her , not inflict bodily harm .
do i look like a kidnapper to you ?
well , you look like
a woman with unlimited resources
frank , thank god .
would you please talk to these men ?
detective , could we have a word ?
detective .
look , i can vouch
for mrs. grayson &apos;s whereabouts all afternoon .
we were together , if you get my meaning .
ah , so you &apos;re mr. gray
no
i work for him .
i worked for the bureau before that .
are you charging her ?
we &apos;re just asking questions .
it sounds like she &apos;s answered &apos; em .
let &apos;s go , gibbs .
mrs. grayson , i suggest you stay put .
i can &apos;t believe this is happening .
where have you been ?
i went to dr . banks &apos; office .
the police were all over it .
okay , her computer and external hard drives are missing .
so it &apos;s out there ? it &apos;s everywhere ?
it &apos;s okay . this is why we &apos;re gonna get to her
before the police do .
i want you to call your assistant .
have her put together a list
of anyone who had access to that video .
thank you , frank .
i wouldn &apos;t know what to do without you .
then call your husband .
he needs to know what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;ll get us some more wine .
all right , you miss this , we lose ...
to two chicks .
no pressure .
thanks . i got it .
doesn &apos;t count unless you call it .
8 @-@ ball , side pocket .
you mean ...
this pocket ?
oh , my god .
looks like your luck just ran out .
you played dirty .
oh , i can get a lot dirtier .
what are frick and frack doing here ?
getting loaded .
and laid by the looks of things .
yo , bartender ! another round of shots on danny &apos;s tab , okay ?
amanda .
i asked you to draw something different today .
this is another picture of you and your father .
take me to see him , and then i &apos;ll draw anything you want .
you know you will never see that man again .
tell me why .
because they took him away .
because he hurt people .
because he killed people .
that &apos;s a lie .
they did it .
there is no &quot; they , &quot; amanda .
if you don &apos;t stop challenging me on this ,
you might wind up spending the rest of
your childhood in this place .
is that what you want ?
i want to see my daddy .
evening , ems .
thought you &apos;d be amused to know
that your fake boyfriend is busy making
a drunken ass of himself
at your other boyfriend &apos;s bar .
i &apos;m gonna have to cut you guys off .
what ?
what are you talking about ? you can &apos;t do that .
boys will be boys .
come on down . testosterone &apos;s on the house .
i have a confession to make .
sometime shortly before we started ,
the dvd ...
went missing .
missing ?
i thought that i had misplaced it ,
but , um , we found it in the dvd player ,
and i chalked it up to a moment of absentmindedness .
we ?
emily and i.
she thought to checkthe tray in the player
and saved the day .
or not , as it turns out .
why isn &apos;t her name on your list ?
you can &apos;t possibly think that emily had anything
to do with this .
besides , she was a victim , too .
and we &apos;ll roll
roll that crimson
daniel .
what happened ?
captain jack happened .
and that is all the time
i have for questions tonight .
good night , sports fans .
i &apos;m so sorry , mrs. grayson . i tried to stop him , but--
well , you know how he gets .
i , uh , i thought it was better to stay with him ,
keep him from doing anything stupid .
you know , like last summer .
well , suddenly last summer &apos;s
beginning to look like a cake walk .
see to it he falls asleep face down .
i &apos;ll start on these .
what &apos;s going on here ?
a very long story .
suffice to say , we both spent our nights
neck deep in grayson drama .
you really are sober , aren &apos;t you ?
as a judge .
police now believe the same person
is behind the hamptonsexposed web site
and the break in at dr. banks &apos; office .
when asked about suspects in her disappearance ,
detective said they had a list
as long as dr. banks &apos; patient roster .
if you have any information ... - where &apos;s daniel ?
i &apos;d say , uh ,
the more pressing mystery
is the whereabouts of dr. banks .
if you have any information that could help authorities
on her whereabouts ,
please call the action news crime line . - hey
you just missed your friends .
i heard .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s a bar .
it &apos;s no big deal .
can i get you something ?
i mean , i can &apos;t offer you a gourmet meal ,
but we do carry several not @-@ so @-@ pricey wines .
not tonight , but thank you .
man , she &apos;s a--
she &apos;s a tough one to figure out .
she &apos;s got issues .
got nothing but ...
nice things to say about you , though .
what are you talking about ?
see for yourself .
please listen to me .
it was never my intention to hurt anyone today .
so , whoever you are ,
please , i am begging you ,
just let me out of here so that we can talk .
can you hear me ?
is there anybody out there ? !
can you hear me ?
please let me out of here .
who the hell are you ?
in a surprise twist ,
in an already incredible story ,
an anonymous tip to the action news crime line
led south hampton police
right to the missing dr. michelle banks ,
who was pulled from this storage facility just moments ago .
cops have been on the scene ,
combing this area for hours ,
trying to gather up evidence and looking for suspects .
we do know that dr. banks is okay .
we have not yet been able to--
she &apos;s been by my side the whole night .
and what can you tell me about where that tip came from ?
well , thank you for your time , detective .
they &apos;re saying michelle never got a look at her attacker ,
but they &apos;re gonna want to follow with you .
why ?
because the storage unit that she was found in
was registered to grayson global .
what the hell is going on here , frank ?
i don &apos;t know .
but i &apos;m gonna get to the bottom of it ,
i promise .
frank .
would you spend the night here ?
i don &apos;t want to be alone in this house .
i mean , i always knew things were weird between us ,
but i never thought ...
she actually hated me .
nah , hey , come on . that &apos;s not what she said .
yeah , right .
she said she wished i had never been borned ,
which is worse .
i always knew daniel was her favorite .
yeah , all right , trust me ,
i @-@ i have an older brother , too ,
so i know the feeling .
only now mine &apos;s my guardian .
so what happened to your mom ?
she left .
yeah , when i was , like , 2 .
i don &apos;t even remember her .
jack does , but he doesn &apos;t talk about her .
i don &apos;t know ,
maybe that &apos;s what kept me from hocking her ring .
like some stupid part of me
thinks she &apos;s gonna come back for it .
can i see ?
well , if it matters ,
you wouldn &apos;t have gotten much for it .
it &apos;s fake .
oh , it figures .
but you know what ?
it &apos;s priceless to you ,
and that &apos;s so much more important .
you should go home ,
and work it out with your mom .
at least you have one , right ?
dr. banks , you must be relieved .
i &apos;ll be relieved
when the sick person who nocked my unconscious
and locked me up is apprehended .
until then ,
it seems dr. banks will be looking over her shoulder
wondering not if , but when
her attacker might strike again .
we will stay ...
the greatest weapon anyone can use against us
is our mind ,
by preying on the doubts and uncertainties
that already lurk there .
are we true to ourselves ?
or do we live for the expectations of others ?
and if we are open and honest ,
can we ever truly be loved ?
now i &apos;ve met this guy , and ...
even though i don &apos;t know him very well ,
i @-@ i have this strange feeling ,
that ... he could be the one .
it &apos;s just a feeling that i @-@ i get .
can we find the courage to release our deepest secrets ?
sleep tight , buddy .
or in the end ...
are we all unknowable ...
what are you thinking about ?
the past ,
even to ourselves ?
it reminds me how much i ...
once loved him .
conrad ?
no .
not conrad .
victoria , what are you doing here ?
i had to see you .
you &apos;re soaking wet .
i @-@ i told conrad i was leaving him .
but i thought you said ...
i can &apos;t live this way anymore and ...
