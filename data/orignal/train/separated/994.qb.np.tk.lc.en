after an incident at school ...
gaby was forced to replace the p.t.a. president .
me ?
carlos was struggling with his guilt .
this is not me . i can &apos;t sleep . i &apos;m seeing ghosts .
i know .
susan found a way to cope .
i &apos;m taking a painting class
being taught by andre zeller . great .
but the famous painter didn &apos;t make it easy .
you &apos;re a bored housewife trying to kill time
between spin class and driving your kid
to soccer practice .
and lynette discovered that since their separation ,
tom had started dating .
it &apos;s just a couple of dinners and ... coffee .
god , tom . when were you gonna tell me this ?
in their 20 years together ,
tom and lynette scavo had followed a few simple rules ...
always share the housework ...
never waste the hot water ,
and never , ever go to bed angry .
yes , the rules for being together were simple .
but the rules for being apart ...
were anything but .
stop calling it &quot; dating . &quot;
it &apos;s dinner with a friend .
do not do that . do not do the snort .
could you make her stop snorting ?
lynette , i find it more effective
when we use words rather than inflammatory noises .
you want words ? here are some words .
liar , liar , pants on fire .
lobster for two at chez nous
is not &quot; dinner with a friend . &quot;
a $ 300 night at sakura
is not strapping on a feedbag with a buddy .
i still do our credit card bills , genius .
all right , enough words .
hey , it &apos;s not like i went looking for this .
jane lives in the building . we got to talking .
you know what ? she was actually nice to me--
something i &apos;m not used to .
oh , i can &apos;t snort , but a drive @-@ by like that &apos;s okay ?
all right , emotions are running a little hot ,
but i think i know why .
you two embarked on this separation
without a clear goal in mind .
are you trying to get back together ,
or are you trying to find
a graceful way to end the marriage ?
we don &apos;t have to decide this right now ,
but we do need to lay down some ground rules .
for example , are you dating ?
he is .
two dinners .
all right , so you are dating .
what about sex ?
no .
not yet .
i @-@ i ...
he just answered your first question .
he wants to end the marriage .
no , lynette , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying .
i &apos;m not giving up .
&quot; not yet &quot; ?
look , i still hope that we can find a way
to work things out ,
but ...
we don &apos;t make each other happy .
we haven &apos;t for a long time .
so what if--i mean ,
what if there was someone out there who could ?
i just feel like if we don &apos;t ...
explore ...
then we are gonna end up right back in here , on this couch ,
hating each other .
sounds like you have a lot to consider .
there &apos;s nothing to consider .
we &apos;re ... cleared for sex .
let the dating begin .
yes , tom and lynette were learning the rules of separation .
and the first rule ?
and i can &apos;t wait to let my new boyfriend
do that thing i never let you do .
there are no rules .
in any group ,
there are roles that people are destined to play--
the perfect homemaker to bring the snacks ,
the financial wizard to keep the books ...
and the busybody to share the gossip .
but sometimes the most important role of all
goes to someone
who &apos;s not the slightest bit prepared for it .
hi , guys . i know , i &apos;m a little bit late .
a little ? try 45 minutes .
well , once you hear what i &apos;ve been through ,
you will totally understand .
so ... you know how it &apos;s called a hot stone massage ?
so there i am at the spa ,
laid out with my mojito , my &quot; marie claire , &quot;
and all of a sudden , i feel a cold rock on my ass .
i know !
so armando was all apologetic . he wanted to reheat the rocks .
but at this point , i &apos;m like ,
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve got a p.t.a. meeting to run . &quot;
if you left , why are you late ?
oh , armando felt so bad ,
he gave me a complimentary seaweed wrap .
so ... what &apos;s on the agenda here ?
we &apos;re supposed to plan teacher appreciation night .
mm . right , right . so who &apos;s doing what for that ?
cindy , you wanna handle the food ?
no .
okay .
rachel , you never stop talking . you wanna emcee ?
no .
okay , what &apos;s going on here ?
what &apos;s going on is you &apos;ve wasted our time .
i &apos;m leaving . i have to pick up my kids .
i have to get back to my job .
i need to take my mother to chemo .
wh--okay , okay . let &apos;s not play sad @-@ life poker here .
i need your help .
you know , we would love to fritter away our days
with manicures and hairdressers and spa appointments ,
but we &apos;re not like you . we have lives .
so you can do teacher appreciation night on your own .
wh--
well , could you at least fold up your chairs
and stack &apos; em on the rolling cart ?
and can someone empty the coffeepot ?
you &apos;d really do--
jeez ! talk about selfish .
oh , thank goodness . you &apos;re alive .
i &apos;m sorry , reverend .
i know that i haven &apos;t been to church for a few sundays .
a few ? try five .
you know who &apos;s been bringing snacks to fellowship hour ?
helen johnson .
ugh . let me guess .
bran muffins from the mini @-@ mart ?
why hast thou forsaken me ?
i should &apos;ve called you .
it &apos;s just , i haven &apos;t been feeling ...
very spiritual lately .
it &apos;s not uncommon for us
to lose our way spiritually from time to time ,
to feel ...
in the woods .
interesting choice of words .
it &apos;s just that i ...
feel like maybe i &apos;m not worthy of ...
god &apos;s love right now ,
that ...
i &apos;ve lost my connection to him .
but here &apos;s the good thing about god , bree--
he &apos;s easy to find .
just seek out the people who are in need ,
and there he is .
it always comes back to the needy with you , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s kind of in the job description .
i hear your new neighbor ben faulkner
does wonderful work with the homeless .
why don &apos;t you speak to him ?
perhaps i will .
thank you , reverend .
i did mention that helen &apos;s doing the snacks , right ?
i just finished a batch of macadamia nut scones .
would you like one ?
bless you , my child .
and maybe one for the car ?
it &apos;s so nervous every time i walk into this class .
i mean , andre zeller , right ?
between you and me ,
he doesn &apos;t think i &apos;m a serious artist .
but i &apos;ll show him . i have pain .
i mean , like this morning ,
my 9 @-@ year @-@ old walked right into school
without even saying good @-@ bye .
no hug , no kiss .
nothing .
well , i &apos;m gonna take that misery and use it in my art .
i &apos;m using my father &apos;s suicide .
today we &apos;ll be working with light and shadow .
ooh ! eggs . cool .
ms. delfino , this is my breakfast .
you will not be sketching eggs
or any other hackneyed still lifes today .
you &apos;ll be drawing the male form .
emile .
sorry .
takes some ... getting used to .
as you begin to sketch ,
think of the human form as an object .
what is it that catches your eye ?
didn &apos;t mean it . just popped out .
i want you to pay close attention
to which parts of the human body reflect light
and which parts cast a shadow .
i &apos;m sorry , ms. delfino .
i didn &apos;t realize we were in junior high .
have you never seen a penis before ?
no . no . yes , i have .
uh , lots . well , not lots .
the appropriate ... amount .
please try to be professional .
i am . i am professional .
penis , penis , penis .
just trying to take the power out of it .
quick .
tell me about your father &apos;s suicide .
hey . what are you doing ?
i was , uh , looking for my phone ,
i know this is gonna sound stupid , but ...
i couldn &apos;t go in there .
oh , god . i don &apos;t mean to sound insensitive ,
but is this dead guy angst ?
&apos;cause i am really pooped right now .
it &apos;s just , every time i go into that room ,
i think about that night .
well , here &apos;s an idea . don &apos;t go in that room .
look , there &apos;s the kitchen . no one died in there .
you know what ? we &apos;re both stressed .
i &apos;ll pour us a couple of drinks .
no , thanks . i &apos;ve been hitting that stuff
pretty hard lately .
i don &apos;t want it to become a thing .
well , after the day i had ,
i &apos;ll finish the bottle myself .
this p.t.a. gig is turning into a serious pain in the ass .
yeah .
i show up the teensiest bit late ,
and the girls are all over me .
they &apos;re like , &quot; gaby , why are you late ?
&quot; you should be sad and miserable and on time ,
&quot; just like us . &quot;
it &apos;s like they &apos;re jealous or something .
oh , my god .
they &apos;re jealous .
i know what to do . thanks for listening .
it &apos;s nothing fancy , but , uh , i &apos;m proud to say
we feed hundreds of homeless people every day .
oh . wonderful .
this is exactly what i &apos;m looking for .
well , great .
but , uh , just out of curiosity ...
uh , what did you do ?
excuse me ?
well , when most people wanna give back ,
it usually means they &apos;ve done something
they &apos;re , uh , ashamed of .
you know , embezzlement , adultery .
what &apos;s your story ?
i suppose i could ask you the same thing .
and i &apos;d have the good sense not to answer .
i &apos;ve just been feeling disconnected lately ,
and i thought by doing something meaningful with my days
that i could change that .
actual selflessness . that &apos;s refreshing .
i wish the city council was as enlightened as you .
oh ?
ah , they &apos;re holding up one of my developments
&apos;cause it includes low @-@ income housing .
ah . typical &quot; not in my backyard &quot; attitude .
by the way ...
it &apos;s not in your backyard .
uh , i &apos;m gonna have to take this .
but , uh , i will leave you in the capable hands
of , uh , donnie here .
excuse me .
hello ?
who are you ?
oh , i am bree , your humble sous chef .
what do you need me to do ? prep ? saute ? chop ?
you wanna prep ?
start prepping .
that &apos;s ... it ?
oh , i forgot to show you the spice rack .
here you go . salt . pepper .
and we &apos;re out of pepper .
if i may ,
have you ever considered making the soup from scratch ?
we don &apos;t have time for that .
just get &apos; em in and get &apos; em out .
yes , because we all know
how pressed for time the homeless are .
look , these people may not have homes ,
but they do have taste buds .
would you be offended
if i tried whipping up a batch of homemade soup ?
can you get it done by noon ?
oh , dear . i guess i &apos;ll have to keep it simple .
it &apos;s just a rustic acorn squash bisque
finished with a dot of maple @-@ infused creme fraiche
and a little crumble of fried sage .
holy crap !
finally , a blurb for my next cookbook .
i understand that some of you are uncomfortable
with the naked body , maybe even find it laughable .
mr. zeller , i &apos;m so sorry .
one cannot create real art
if one is crippled by one &apos;s own inhibitions .
i &apos;m gonna strip them away .
so ... for our next class , we &apos;re not gonna have nude models .
we &apos;re gonna have nude painters .
what ?
painting in the nude will force you
to create from a place of total honesty .
and if you &apos;re serious about being an artist ,
you shouldn &apos;t have a problem with it .
nope . no problem at all .
what &apos;s going on , gaby ?
yeah . why &apos;d you call us here ?
i just want to apologize
for what happened at the last meeting .
keep talkin &apos; .
it was wrong of me to blow you off for a spa appointment
when you have such busy lives .
message received , loud and clear .
thank you .
so to show you i &apos;ve taken your complaint to heart ,
may i present my beauty team !
armando , the best masseuse in town ,
kay , my hairdresser ,
and ping on nails .
you no longer have to be jealous of my fabulous life .
for one day , you can be me .
my treat . go crazy .
wow . good to know you got our message .
you &apos;r &apos; welcome .
so you think you might want to reconsider doing the food ?
i &apos;d love to .
uh , i &apos;ll handle decorations .
yeah , whatever you need from us .
that &apos;s more like it .
now today , relax .
take a break from grocery shopping and spanking .
i have to go meet my travel agent .
are you guys serious ? are we really helping her ?
no .
we &apos;re helping ourselves to a free spa day ,
then we &apos;re going to leave her twisting in the wind .
oh ! hey , ladies ,
anyone know of a good hotel in the south of france ?
i &apos;m sorry . i did it again !
i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
hey , lynette ,
did i leave those fabric samples ?
busted !
that is a porn slam if i &apos;ve ever seen one .
porn ? mm . no . i was checking my e @-@ mail .
come on . it &apos;s okay . we all look at porn .
what are you into ?
straight , bi , solo , bald guys ,
fuzzy whispers , cinnamon cakes ,
poodling ?
do i have to learn what those are ?
&apos;cause i really don &apos;t want to know .
oh , come on . let me see . i promise i will not judge .
no . i signed up for an online dating service ,
and i took a stab at my introduction video .
hi , i &apos;m lynette .
i &apos;m 35 to 45 @-@ ish .
i &apos;m a cancer , and i beat cancer .
coincidence or not ? you decide .
that is more disturbing
than any porn i &apos;ve ever seen .
you said you wouldn &apos;t judge .
oh ! online dating sucks .
it &apos;s full of guys who photoshop hair on their heads
and crop out their man boobs .
you want to meet men ? i &apos;m taking you to a bar .
a bar ? oh , i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s been 25 years since i tried to pick up a guy .
well , with me as your wingwoman , you can have any man you want .
friday okay ?
i thought you had a date with ben .
mm . he canceled . again .
some stupid real estate development for the poor .
bastard .
well , his loss .
if he doesn &apos;t appreciate what he &apos;s got ,
i will find someone who does .
oh , and lay off the ice cream .
there &apos;s no photoshop in real life .
morning . what &apos;s for breakfast ?
eggs . i was gonna make bacon , but it seemed a little risky .
susan , you get upset if i take my socks off in the kitchen .
what &apos;s going on ?
andre feels &quot; until we shed our inhibitions ,
our art will be only superficial . &quot;
anyway ,
for our next class , we have to paint in the nude .
so i &apos;m trying to get used to it .
and i want to prove to him that i can be a real artist .
wow , that guy is good .
he gets to see a bunch of coeds naked
and call it work .
oh , honey , i &apos;m kidding .
no , i can &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m not a naked person .
maybe i &apos;m not a real artist either .
susan .
no , i mean it .
andre doesn &apos;t like any of my work .
i &apos;m not serious like the other students .
i think i &apos;m just gonna quit the class .
quit ? but this class has been really good for you .
it seems like it was pulling you
out of that dark place you &apos;ve been in .
you think so ?
yeah , and i feel like i &apos;m getting my old susie back .
besides , this guy sounds like a jackass .
don &apos;t let him win .
you &apos;re right .
i am a serious artist .
i just need to get used to people seeing me naked .
susan ! it &apos;s lee . you home ?
perfect . my best gay .
who better to practice on ?
good morning , lee .
this is bob &apos;s--mother of god !
gay marriage doesn &apos;t seem so freaky now , does it ?
looks like my tuscan bean
with parmesan crostini is a hit .
yeah , it is , but i think you &apos;re starting
to attract the wrong sort of crowd .
excuse me , but , uh , you don &apos;t exactly look homeless to me .
yeah , i @-@ i &apos;m homeless .
and yet you have a $ 2,000 laptop ?
but i live in the box it came in ?
okay , i @-@ i &apos;m a college student .
but my parents did stop talking to me
when i switched from pre @-@ med to creative writing .
well , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna have to leave .
too bad . i just gave you mad props on my blog .
is that a good thing ?
yeah .
&quot; homey but refined ,
bree van de camp &apos;s tuscan bean soup
is a revelation in a bowl . &quot;
revelation , you say ?
uh @-@ huh . and it &apos;s already been &quot; liked &quot; on facebook
and retweeted 200 times ...
which is also a good thing .
but hey , if i gotta go ...
hold on .
i can &apos;t let a talented
near @-@ orphan like you go hungry .
let me get you a refill .
oh , and it &apos;s &quot; van de kamp ... &quot; with a &quot; k. &quot;
hey , mike . need a hand ?
no , i &apos;m okay .
uh , susan around ?
uh , she &apos;s at her painting class .
okay .
i &apos;ll ... stop by later .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
you need to say something to me , mike ?
yeah , i do .
if things were different ,
if it had been me that killed somebody ,
and your wife walked in ,
i &apos;d have gone to the cops and turned myself in .
i wouldn &apos;t have dragged gaby into it .
there &apos;s a lot i would &apos;ve done
differently about that night if i could .
yeah , well , you can &apos;t .
but here &apos;s what you can do-- you can leave susan alone .
just let her find a way to deal with what you put her through .
it just really helps
to talk to her .
but it doesn &apos;t help her .
then ...
i won &apos;t do it anymore .
yeah .
remember , technique is a crutch .
learn it and throw it away .
that way you can begin to find your own voice
and that &apos;s what that ...
oh , my god .
taking casual friday a bit to the extreme ,
aren &apos;t we , ms. delfino ?
isn &apos;t this the day we were ...
aren &apos;t we all supposed to be ...
the school put the kibosh on my little artistic experiment .
it was all there in the e @-@ mail .
what e @-@ mail ?
the one you obviously didn &apos;t open .
maybe you didn &apos;t send me one .
why would i do that ?
to humiliate me .
to punish me for laughing .
you have singled me out since day one .
why not try to make a fool of me ?
because in the vast landscape of my interior life ,
you &apos;re merely a dust speck .
now get dressed and sit down .
no .
i signed up for this class to learn something ,
not to be a punching bag
for an egomaniac
with a paintbrush !
i quit !
hello and welcome to our soup kitchen .
i hope you &apos;re hungry , because i have prepared
a hearty italian wedding soup today .
donnie , two .
reverend sykes . what a nice surprise !
that &apos;s quite a crowd out front .
i practically had to fight my way in .
well , ever since i took over the kitchen ,
we &apos;ve been jam @-@ packed .
thank you so much for suggesting i get involved .
i have never felt more needed or important in my whole life .
the intention of charity
is not to make us feel important .
of course not . it &apos;s to help people .
feeling important &apos;s just a bonus .
so what brings you by ?
i was hoping you could tell me
where a homeless person could get a hot meal .
well , right here , of course .
no , bree .
ever since you &apos;ve turned this soup kitchen
into a bisque kitchen ,
the homeless don &apos;t feel comfortable here .
why ? i was just trying to make this place special .
it was already special . it was home for them ,
until you took that away .
excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re gonna need to leave .
hey , we &apos;re still eating .
well , then go eat somewhere else .
you certainly look like you can afford to .
whoa . where &apos;s the attitude coming from ?
we made this place a success .
no . this place is supposed to feed homeless people .
it &apos;s a dismal failure .
this food isn &apos;t for you .
it &apos;s for the hungry and the poor--
the people we walk past every day .
everyone deserves to have a place ,
and this place was theirs
until i made it mine .
so please , pack up your laptops
and your smartphones and go .
please go .
ben , i &apos;m sorry . i have made a terrible mess of things .
don &apos;t worry about it .
you think you can make a speech that good again tomorrow ?
speech ?
you &apos;re gonna help me push that low @-@ income housing project
through city council .
this is where you live , huh ?
norman rockwell would walk down this street
and say , &quot; a little much . &quot;
can i come in ?
of course . how else are you gonna make fun
of the inside of my house ?
by the way , i , uh , checked my e @-@ mail ,
and , uh , you never sent me one .
did you check your campus e @-@ mail ?
i have a campus e @-@ mail ?
okay , i &apos;m gonna make this brief ,
mainly because i &apos;ve got a dinner engagement
with someone infinitely more interesting than you .
climb down from your cross
and come back to my class .
why ? so you can abuse me more ?
yes , i will abuse you and scream at you ,
make you paint in the nude and do anything else
i have to do to get you to stop being so scared .
i &apos;m not scared .
i showed up at your class naked .
then you ran away .
it seems to me you do a lot of running away
and nervous giggling .
you act like someone who &apos;s ...
what ?
you &apos;re hiding something ,
and i &apos;m gonna pull it out of you ,
and when that happens , there is a chance--
the remotest , slimmest wisp of a chance--
that you might actually become an artist .
oh , god . is this the part where you tell me
that the reason you &apos;re being so hard on me
is because i &apos;m the only one in the class with potential ?
no .
amy yamata &apos;s the only one in the class with potential .
you &apos;re a bizarre car crash that
somehow fascinates me .
thank you ?
now if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
this is about as long as i can spend
in a room decorated with ceramic elephants .
hi , ladies . someone wanna help me with these flowers ?
okay , no worries . i got it .
what have you guys been doing ?
people are gonna be here in two hours . nothing &apos;s been set up .
well , i &apos;m just so relaxed from that massage .
i &apos;d hate to lift something and tense up again .
yeah , and--and ping worked so hard on these nails .
i would hate to chip them .
and i ... can &apos;t think of anything witty to say
about my fabulous new &apos; do ,
but i &apos;m not doing squat either .
why are you doing this to me ?
i went out of my way to help you people .
oh , my god , you are so out of touch .
do you really think a hot stone massage
is gonna solve my problems ?
you don &apos;t understand the kinds of things real people deal with .
you live in this perfect little fairy tale .
fine . i don &apos;t need your help .
i have two hours
and a very capable husband .
this event is going off without a hitch .
oh , and one more thing .
hello ?
honey , sorry to bother you at work ,
but this is an emergency .
whoa . what &apos;s going on ?
i need you to meet me at the school .
these p.t.a. beeyotches--
yeah , i &apos;m talking to you , cindy ...
are refusing to help me .
i need an extra pair of hands .
sure . i &apos;ll be--be right there .
ha ! he &apos;s on his way .
thanks . you &apos;re a lifesaver .
wow . when i pictured this in my head ,
i wasn &apos;t as old as all the other people ...
combined .
uh , two martinis , dirty .
oh , wait . that &apos;s me .
feel free to use that if you want .
maybe i will ... at home , &apos; cause that &apos;s where i &apos;m going .
oh , relax .
look at this place like a candy store .
you just have to figure out what you &apos;re in the mood for .
obviously , something with nuts .
i thought i was done with this .
i dated , i combed through all the losers ,
and i finally found a guy ,
someone who was smart and made me laugh .
and now to be back here , at my age ,
doing it all over again , it &apos;s depressing .
oh , my god . you &apos;re right .
what ?
it is depressing .
renee .
what am i doing in hell &apos;s candy store ?
i have a guy . he &apos;s smart and he makes me laugh .
i thought you said ben works too much .
oh , he &apos;s passionate about his job , but he &apos;s a 10 .
you add up every guy in this place and you get a 6 .
but you stay . there &apos;s definitely somebody here for you .
orange cable ...
goes around here ...
this one goes here .
ha ! and ... presto !
so is &quot; presto &quot; spanish for &quot; cover your ears &quot; ?
that &apos;s hilarious , cindy .
you know , you should &apos;ve been a comic
instead of a pint @-@ sized pain in my ass !
oh , it &apos;s getting late .
looks like your perfect husband
isn &apos;t gonna be here to bail you out .
aha ! look who &apos;s here .
there &apos;s my hero !
now hurry up . we need to get cracking here .
hey , what are you doing ?
carlos .
hey , gaby .
carlos , you can &apos;t be here like this .
you &apos;ve gotta go .
no , no , no . gonna help , okay ?
no . please . you need to leave .
no , i &apos;m gonna help , okay ? gonna help .
no , honey . you have to leave , please .
hang on . hang on .
rachel , get the soundboard set up .
melissa , megan , start putting out the food .
melissa , now .
it &apos;s okay , gaby .
we got it .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
just take care of your husband .
hello .
i &apos;m phil , and you &apos;re beautiful .
you &apos;re just saying that .
but i &apos;ll take it .
god knows it took me long enough to get ready tonight .
i even had to pay the sitter to come early .
sitter ? so you have kids ?
yeah .
five . five kids .
wow . that sounds like a lot .
i actually have a husband , too , but we &apos;re separated ,
and we &apos;re seeing other people .
or he is , and i &apos;m trying to .
not that i &apos;m doing it to retaliate , it &apos;s just that--
wow . i can &apos;t seem to stop talking .
maybe you could say something now .
bye .
bye @-@ bye .
crowd &apos;s a little light tonight , don &apos;t you think ?
can i buy you a drink or are you already lit ?
oh , come on . i &apos;ll let you play with my tie .
here &apos;s the remote .
don &apos;t i know you from somewhere ?
okay . not the most original line ,
but you &apos;re cute , so ... lynette .
right . right .
you &apos;re porter and preston &apos;s mom .
oh , god .
mrs. scavo was the coolest mom .
she used to make us grilled cheese
in the shape of dinosaurs . so what are you doing here ?
i have no idea .
here you go .
it &apos;s probably the only set of keys with a purple lanyard .
my kid made it at camp .
look , i &apos;m wearing something called skinny jeans ,
which are very painful
because i don &apos;t have something called skinny legs ,
so i just wanna go home
and peel them off . do you mind ?
no , not at all . i just-- i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t work here .
oh , god . i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;re not the valet .
i knew this vest was a bad idea ,
but the gay guy in my office told me they &apos;re back .
no , the vest is great .
i have it in navy .
it &apos;s just--i haven &apos;t been out in so long ,
i figured i &apos;d try to mix things up .
you haven &apos;t been out in so long ?
last time i was at a bar like this ,
beeper numbers were exchanged .
i didn &apos;t even know they banned smoking in bars .
and how did the good , old , reliable martini
lose its job ?
apple ? cherry ? watermelon ?
those are slushie flavors .
i &apos;m lynette .
scott .
by the way , not that it &apos;s a competition ,
but i have two lanyards on my keychain .
they &apos;re pink .
daughters ?
yes .
divorce ?
no , thanks . i already had one .
you ?
uh , separated .
listen , this is the first decent conversation i &apos;ve had all night .
what do you say we go back inside and continue it ?
i say ...
pomegranatinis are on me .
all right . that was easy .
you calling me easy ?
not yet .
um , please .
uh , can i get you something to dink ?
i have , uh , vodka .
i have milk . i have chocolate milk .
i have juice boxes .
having kids has really ruined my game , huh ?
vodka and chocolate milk--
that &apos;s exactly what i give my baby to calm her down .
cheers .
cheers .
now what do we do ?
i &apos;d put on some music ,
but my ex got all my cds .
i could turn on a black light ,
but i &apos;m not 16 .
maybe i could light some candles ,
but that seems like kind of an obvious move , right ?
not as obvious as this .
maybe obvious isn &apos;t so bad .
no ?
no . oh , no , it &apos;s good . it &apos;s good . keep going .
i have another room that i would love to show you .
really ?
you &apos;re getting ... better at this .
oh ! hang on . hang on .
shoot !
oh . right here ?
okay .
no , i ... dropped something .
oh . can i help ?
my ring fell off . you had to have shag carpeting , huh ?
ugh . that gay guy at my office
said shag was back .
really need to start getting my style tips from someone else .
damn it . where is it ?
this rug-- it swallows everything .
there used to be an end table here and ...
oh , my god ! please don &apos;t be funny right now .
wait . wait . wait .
here it is .
thank you .
so , uh , where were we ?
i &apos;m sorry . i can &apos;t .
you &apos;re a really great guy .
you &apos;re nice and you &apos;re funny and ...
whatever you were doing ...
to--to my neck was really working for me ,
but the idea of walking 10 feet into your bedroom
is about the scariest thing i can think of right now .
okay .
i &apos;m ...
hoping to work things out with my husband ,
and i guess i just--
i get it .
you &apos;re not there yet .
i &apos;m not .
well , i think i should go .
come on .
i understand your hesitation .
i am one of those people with a manicured lawn
who would object
when a proposal like this
threatens her community .
but my eyes have been opened ,
and i will personally go door @-@ to @-@ door
to help other people see how essential this project is ,
so that where we live can truly
be called a community .
you were amazing .
well , i meant every word .
i want to help you any way i can .
great . well , uh , first thing tomorrow ,
i &apos;ll take you out to see the construction site .
yes , we may think
we &apos;re all destined to play certain roles .
but sometimes those roles can unexpectedly change .
a nervous student
may discover a hidden confidence .
a longtime wife
may confront a harsh new reality .
a busy mother
may find her attention is needed elsewhere .
and a woman who wanted to do a little bit of good
may find herself playing
a much bigger role than she intended .
i was searching and searching for the perfect spot ,
and then i found it--
chapman woods .
have you ever been here before ?
once .
well , they &apos;re finally gonna break ground on tuesday ,
and it &apos;s all thanks to you .
