gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
this is my granddaughter , charlie rhodes .
no one can touch me anymore .
i &apos;m a rhodes now .
charlotte rhodes ?
my husband and i were looking for my niece
with the same name , remember ?
did you ever find her ?
she was with her mother .
if they ever found out the truth
about the real charlotte rhodes ,
they would never forgive me .
i &apos;m leaving tonight .
this time , i &apos;m not coming back .
you must be pretty desperate to flirt with me
by doing manual labor .
this isn &apos;t flirting .
i &apos;ve always wanted to load a catering van .
i love you , dan humphrey .
always have . always will .
you saw the chance to be her only savior ,
her knight in shining armor .
are you really mad about blair ,
or is this about us .
because i haven &apos;t given you an answer yet ?
you just did .
of course i love you , chuck .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
i know who sent the video
of blair and chuck to &quot; gossip girl &quot; in the first place .
it &apos;s a dirty job , but someone &apos;s gotta do it .
there is nothing between us but a contract .
our marriage is all for show .
you and your family will quite literally pay the consequence ,
or did you forget about the dowry ?
your family cannot control mine .
yes , they can .
i don &apos;t believe in saving myself
and ruining our family at the same time .
another picture @-@ perfect valentine &apos;s day on the upper east side ,
and how am i going to celebrate ?
by exposing a giant secret today
that &apos;s sure to break more than a few hearts .
you can just drop those right there . thank you .
miss blair ! you &apos;re back !
oh ! i @-@ i was worried you &apos;d be locked away in big , stone tower somewhere
and only way to speak
is through smoke signals or coded messages on twitter .
thankfully , dorota , we don &apos;t need to learn navajo just yet .
the truth is , after our horrid faux honeymoon ,
i think louis was glad to get back to monaco
and be rid of me for a little while .
so this mean you no longer trapped in his evil grasp .
not exactly .
dorota , this is estee ,
a.k.a. my new social secretary .
a.k.a. my royal minder .
but i &apos;ve just been calling her &quot; creeper &quot; for short .
estee will be accompanying me now
on all official public outings .
did i mention she also reads my mail
and performs nightly bed checks ?
blair &apos;s first public appearance will be this evening ,
just as soon as she picks one of these charity galas
to make her official debut as princess .
how great is that ?
oh , wow , that &apos;s beautiful .
good morning . wh @-@ what &apos;s all this ?
it &apos;s called valentine &apos;s day , dan .
i &apos;m picking out some cartier jewelry
to give to lily tonight .
so where is she ? aren &apos;t you afraid she &apos;s gonna see it ?
mm , she &apos;s in d.c. at a fund @-@ raiser luncheon .
won &apos;t be back till this afternoon .
and tonight , chuck has hooked us up
with a huge suite at the empire .
pretty romantic , right ?
yeah , that sounds nice .
can i interest you in anything ?
something for your , uh , special lady ?
me ? no , no , no . i have no special lady this year .
honestly , i was just coming by to pick up
those blu @-@ rays i let lily borrow . uh ...
thought maybe i could give them to blair .
you know , she &apos;s back from her honeymoon alone , so ...
so you figure that if you , uh , drop them off ,
maybe she &apos;ll ask you to watch one with her .
well , cinema &apos;s always been intended as a communal art .
it &apos;s better to watch with another person .
she &apos;s a married woman now , dan . it might be time to move on .
i appreciate the advice , dad ,
but i &apos;m just trying to be a good friend .
really , it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
okay .
i can &apos;t stand seeing all these happy people ,
smiling , holding hands , kissing .
don &apos;t remind me .
guess it &apos;s only natural when you and i feel
this anti @-@ valentine &apos;s day .
it hasn &apos;t exactly been a banner year
for either of us in the romance department .
at least the person you love told you they felt the same .
mine didn &apos;t even respond .
well , the good news is , this outsized outpouring
display of public affection will be over tomorrow .
then new yorkers can go back
to being their usual cold , callous selves .
hang in there .
yeah , you , too .
oh , i love them !
sorry . have a good day .
i doubt that .
oh , hey , i guess the honeymoon &apos;s over .
just the person i wanted to see .
i can &apos;t talk now . i &apos;m busy .
wait , wait , wait , stop .
i will not allow us to go on living like this together .
the way i see it , i am mad at you for sending out that video
of me and chuck to &quot; gossip girl , &quot;
and you are mad at me for running off with dan .
so ... they cancel each other out .
actually , yours was way worse .
i @-@ i only needed a ride ,
but the point is--
blair , i didn &apos;t release the video to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
you took the fall for us ?
it seemed like the right thing to do at the time .
well , since you &apos;re clearly looking out
for my best interests , i forgive you .
now can you forgive me for
using your wedding date as a getaway driver ?
well , i was never really mad at you .
okay , well , tell me what incredible romantic plans
you have for today .
oh , you know , just interviewing .
a 70 @-@ year @-@ old avowed celibate woman
for my &quot; all the reasons i hate valentine &apos;s day &quot; column ,
and trying to figure out ways not to become her .
that sounds like an absolutely awful valentine &apos;s day .
they &apos;ve all been pretty awful for the past few years .
the last good one i had was
in high school with--
oh ! you were about to say &quot; with him . &quot;
i have to go .
i heard you were back ,
and i suspected you might not have any big plans tonight ,
so i thought i would , uh , drop off some movies .
i could come back and watch them with you .
i mean , under the radar , of course .
that is sweet , but i actually already have plans
to go back on the radar ,
which you should , too .
you should go out with someone . have fun .
if only it were that easy .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve had a real date on valentine &apos;s day
since , uh , since high school with ... well , serena .
i &apos;ve gotta go meet alessandra at fig &amp; olive
to discuss my next opus , so have a nice night .
you , too , dan .
dorota !
i am suddenly feeling inspired ,
which is why i want to upgrade my royal status
from princess to queen ... of hearts .
and what that mean exactly ?
it means that i will do everything in my power
to get dan and serena back together .
hello ?
lola , hey , it &apos;s nate .
who ?
archibald .
from the wedding .
oh , that nate .
the one i don &apos;t remember giving my number to .
yeah , well , i might have put a little pressure on your boss .
blackmailing bosses may have been the reason
i didn &apos;t give you my number in the first place .
hey , i only offered him some free advertising
in &quot; the spectator , &quot; all right ?
technically , that &apos;s more of a bribe .
all right , either way ,
what are you doing tonight ?
and whatever excuse you &apos;re about to give ,
i &apos;m gonna poke holes in it , okay ?
do you have any idea
how cheesy it is to ask a girl out
for a first date on valentine &apos;s day ?
well , i prefer bold and charming to cheesy ,
but that &apos;s just--
also , did you forget that i &apos;m a cater waiter ?
because valentine &apos;s is one of our busiest nights of the year ,
so thanks for asking .
lola ?
okay , tina , my other informants have come up with nothing
but a new princess under 24 @-@ hour surveillance ,
a lonely boy with no plans ,
and a dog lover who hates the entire holiday .
please tell me you have something better .
i &apos;m afraid not .
nate can &apos;t even get a cater waiter to go out with him .
what the hell am i paying you people for ?
what am i gonna do ?
under my stewardship , &quot; gossip girl &quot;
is but a shell of her former self ,
like aol or courtney love .
the only way to remedy this is with a scandal
to end all scandals .
you have a scandal .
dan humphrey is the one who sent you that video
of chuck and blair at blair &apos;s wedding .
and with that to hold over his head ,
you could get dan to do almost everything .
philip , it &apos;s cute when you pay attention .
but if i &apos;m going to load up dan like a hirsute hand grenade ,
i need everyone to be there when he detonates .
ugh ! it was so much easier to stir stuff up
when we were all in high school
and at the same place all the time .
no .
it &apos;s too bad you can &apos;t all jump into a time machine
and go back to high school then , huh ?
ohh . sweetie .
i knew i married you for a reason ...
besides your money .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about the party ?
which party ?
the &quot; come as you were &quot; party you &apos;re throwing here tonight .
it &apos;s all over &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
dress as your high school self . that &apos;s awesome .
i wish you would have given me a little more notice , though .
i have to deck the place out .
i have to get the gift bags ready .
i have to--
tina , i &apos;m not throwing a party . all right ?
this is someone &apos;s idea of a joke .
it is ?
yeah .
too bad , &apos; cause that would have been great publicity
for &quot; the spectator . &quot;
although it probably would have been impossible
to find a caterer this last minute .
wait . wait , wait , wait . you know what ? why not ?
it is a good idea .
all right , well , see what you can pull together ,
and , uh , i &apos;ll handle the caterer .
guess what , boys and girls ?
looks like school &apos;s back in session .
the question is , have you learned your lessons ?
let &apos;s hope not ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m in the mood to see someone fail .
charlie ?
rufus , hi .
are you okay ? what are you doing here ?
we were so worried about you .
oh , no , i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m totally fine .
i ... i probably should have called weeks ago ,
but , uh , is lily here ?
she &apos;s , uh , on her way back from d.c ..
but i &apos;m sure she &apos;d love to see you .
yeah , i &apos;d love to see her , too .
i &apos;m only in town for a few hours
on my way to europe .
i just wanted to explain
to her in person why i left so abruptly .
yeah . so ... why did you leave so--
oh , no , it &apos;s personal . no offense .
it &apos;s just , i &apos;d rather tell her on my own .
well , you &apos;re welcome to stay and wait till she gets back .
thanks . and you know , i &apos;ve been keeping up
on what &apos;s been happening here since i left
through serena &apos;s blog and &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe blair went through
with her marriage to louis .
i really thought she was gonna end up with chuck .
yeah , between us ,
i think she may have wanted to .
let &apos;s just say while love is a very complicated thing ,
so are prenups .
speaking of love and prenups , uh , i have to go out
and pick up a few more things for lily for tonight .
uh , so stick around . she should be back soon .
see ya .
thanks .
thank you .
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m supposed to meet a lovely elderly woman
who is going to tell me the joys of lifelong chastity ,
but apparently she &apos;s late . what about you ?
i &apos;m meeting my book agent , who &apos;s also late .
serena , i &apos;m sorry . i should &apos;ve--
dan , please , we--we don &apos;t have to discuss this .
let &apos;s just try to move past it , okay ?
okay .
can i interest you both in a glass of dom , on the house ?
it &apos;s a special valentine &apos;s gift
to all of our guests .
sure . i guess one glass wouldn &apos;t hurt .
it &apos;s not our fault our dates are late .
step one is accomplished . the thaw has begun .
like beautiful polish spring .
now on to step two .
really ? she did ?
no , i totally understand .
no , all right . yeah .
have a nice day , too .
what was that ?
that was the catering company .
i specifically asked for lola , that girl from the wedding ,
but it turns out she has a note in her file
that says she can &apos;t work any events at &quot; the spectator . &quot;
what did you do to her , nathaniel ?
nothing . i didn &apos;t do anything .
she was the reason
i agreed to do the party in the first place .
maybe i should just cancel the whole thing .
you &apos;re doing all this for a girl ?
if she won &apos;t work a party at &quot; the spectator , &quot;
would she work one at the empire ?
not if she knew i was throwing it , apparently .
as much as i absolutely loathe this day ,
i can &apos;t deny my best friend a chance at true love .
i &apos;ll be overseeing
the usual festivities downstairs in the bar ,
but i &apos;ll host your party up here ,
and i &apos;ll even call the catering company myself .
really ? you don &apos;t mind ?
that &apos;s great , man . thank you .
excuse me .
we just wanted to tell you
that we think you make a lovely couple .
who ? who , us ?
oh , no , no , no . we &apos;re not .
guess how many years we &apos;ve been together .
54 .
come on . you &apos;re supposed to let them guess .
we were high school sweethearts .
been together ever since .
best 54 years of my life .
sorry . i @-@ i don &apos;t think we ordered this .
this is also on the house , for all our guests .
i don &apos;t see any other tables here with this dessert .
and it &apos;s strange that neither one of our meetings showed up .
okay , alexandra said someone left her a voice mail ,
saying i was canceling .
same with the virgin .
she called the office to reschedule .
gee , i wonder who could be manipulative enough
to call all these people and get away with it .
it &apos;s too bad it &apos;s not valentine &apos;s day
more than once a year .
i could really make a serious go at this whole cupid thing .
yes , &quot; operation : darena &quot; going very smooth .
now that they &apos;re actually talking again ,
we just need to figure out a way to get them both
to nate &apos;s party tonight .
once they see each other in their old uniforms ,
how could all those old feelings not come flooding back ?
it &apos;s true . you never forget first love .
i remember mine . kazimierz .
once , he took me out into sugar beet field ...
thank god .
nate &apos;s party has been moved to the empire .
i told estee we &apos;d stop by , but there &apos;s no way
i can bring a royal minder to my ex &apos;s apartment .
looks like you &apos;ll just have to wear a school uniform
and play cupid in my place .
oh , no .
this is very bad plan .
damn ! nate &apos;s party has been moved to
a suite at the empire .
so ?
so he lives with chuck .
i highly doubt blair &apos;s gonna risk running into her ex
with a royal minder in tow ,
which means when i drop my bum
the person it would hurt the most won &apos;t even be there .
damn !
oh , no .
this better not be someone telling me
that serena &apos;s bailing , too .
i hooked up a doorman at the van der woodsens&apos;
with some free knicks tickets a couple years ago .
best decision i ever made .
i think he saw something that might be of interest to you .
does she know that i &apos;m gone ?
okay . well , uh , tell her i &apos;m running an errand ,
and i &apos;ll be back in a few hours .
okay , thanks .
i &apos;m sorry , but , um , no one &apos;s home right now .
charlotte rhodes .
i &apos;m hurt . you don &apos;t remember me ?
i met you last year at the constance party
when you were pretending to be mentally ill .
although you &apos;re still hanging around here ,
so maybe you really are .
right .
georgina , is it ?
i gave you my number , but you never called ,
which is why when i heard you were back in town ,
i thought i &apos;d come by and catch you in person ,
especially since you have a habit
of bolting so quickly from places .
so ...
what are you doing here ?
just in town for a brief visit , that &apos;s all .
anybody know you &apos;re back ?
only rufus and i &apos;d appreciate it
if it stayed that way .
no problem .
just ... give me some gossip .
or are you gossip enough ?
look , georgina , i just got here . i don &apos;t know anything .
aw . come on now . you &apos;re part of the family .
you must know something .
all i know is that blair and louis
signed sort of a prenup , but in this town ,
that &apos;s hardly news .
you know , you really should have called me .
we could &apos;ve had a lot of fun .
well , at least now i can .
philip , find out who represents the grimaldi family in new york
and meet me there .
oh , and we &apos;re probably gonna have to file for divorce .
looks like &quot; gossip girl &quot; just got her first valentine &apos;s day gift .
hey ! how was your lunch with the vestal virgin ?
helpful and informative or ghost of v @-@ day future ?
you can stop . i know that you canceled my interview
and set me up with dan .
it was an act of goodwill .
just because i can &apos;t have love in my own life
doesn &apos;t mean i shouldn &apos;t bring it to the people
who i care about most .
but dan doesn &apos;t have feelings for me ,
and--and there &apos;s nothing that will change that ,
not some champagne or dazzling dessert .
not even two fake old people in love ?
they weren &apos;t real ?
actor &apos;s equity . but you &apos;re wrong .
do you know what dan said to me this morning ?
same thing you did .
his last good valentine &apos;s day was in high school--with you .
i &apos;m telling you , there &apos;s still a glimmer of hope there .
that &apos;s never gonna happen , but thank you for trying .
wait , wait , wait .
why don &apos;t you come with me and my new royal minder
to the cardiac ball tonight ?
we can bond over our mutual broken hearts
while looking at people with actual broken hearts .
thank you . i think i &apos;ll just stay home ,
eats lots of gelato , and write about how true love
is nothing but a myth .
hey , i was in the neighborhood ,
so i just wanted to stop by and tell you in person
i &apos;m not gonna be able to make it tonight .
come on , man . you , too ?
chuck &apos;s gonna be working . blair and serena are no @-@ shows .
i mean , wh @-@ what &apos;s up ? you have a hot date or something ?
oh , hardly . blair &apos;s trying to set me up with serena ,
which reminded me ,
i didn &apos;t exactly have a great time in high school ,
so i &apos;m not eager to relive it .
before you say &quot; no , &quot; think about this .
there &apos;s gonna be grown women here dressed like schoolgirls .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i can &apos;t make it .
if it makes you feel any better ...
i will totally sign your yearbook .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
what is it ?
带布莱尔参加今晚的派对
it &apos;s , um , something strange .
我就泄露这个
of course i love you , chuck . i &apos;ve always loved you .
i love you more and more every--
um ... you know what ? on second thought ,
i think i will come tonight . i mean , who doesn &apos;t like schoolgirls ?
yes !
hello ?
have you heard from lily ?
it &apos;s getting late , and i really need to catch my flight .
charlie , i feel terrible .
her train was delayed , so she &apos;s headed straight
to , uh , the empire . i &apos;m meeting her there now .
can i swing by there on my way to the airport ?
do you wanna just call her ?
no ! it &apos;s really important .
yeah . o @-@ okay , okay , i &apos;ll tell her you &apos;re on your way .
i know . you &apos;re mad at me
for trying to set you up with serena .
actually , not really . we kinda had a nice time today ,
which got me to thinking that there may be hope for us yet .
i knew it . i knew there was still something between you .
now go ask her to nate &apos;s party .
&quot; guitar hero &quot; in one suite ,
a sushi bar in the other .
ah , a girl gets beaned with a nairtini
用于酒吧倒在别人的头发上
or someone uses a secret key to sneak into the pool .
it &apos;s just like old times .
that sounds romantic , but i was thinking
it might be better to explore whatever future we might have
without the--the pressure of a real date , you know ?
what do you mean ?
well , you did such a good job playing cupid at lunch
that i thought you could do it again ,
so why don &apos;t you come with us ?
i would love to help , but i &apos;ve suddenly got
this royal ... pain in the ass from monaco
who &apos;s watching my every move ,
so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s such a good idea
for me to bring her to chuck &apos;s .
no , what better place to bring her ?
you could finally prove that chuck is no longer a threat ,
and nate said he &apos;s probably not even gonna be there tonight .
chuck won &apos;t be there ?
no .
fine . i &apos;ll make a swing by quickly
on the way to the cardiac ball ,
but just to drop her and go , okay ?
thanks . i &apos;ll see you there .
i can &apos;t believe everything in blair &apos;s prenup--
money , chateaus , portraits .
real estate , yachts , jewels .
she owns half a museum ?
pay dirt .
it says here blair defaults on the marriage
in any way , the waldorf family will owe the royals
so much money , they &apos;ll be bankrupt .
and this helps us how ?
we &apos;re going to show the world
what blair really thinks of her vows ,
and we &apos;re gonna use dan to do it .
look out , b.
you may be trying to play cupid ,
but all the arrows are pointed right at you .
okay , so please tell me again why we &apos;re here ,
why i &apos;m dressed like this , and why you &apos;re not ?
you told me your last good valentine &apos;s day
was in high school , and since taking you
to an actual constance / st. jude party
felt wrong on too many levels ,
i &apos;m taking you to the next best thing--
a simulation .
yeah , but i feel strange ,
and people are looking at me .
trust me , s. i have a big surprise for you tonight .
isn &apos;t this your ex @-@ boyfriend charles bass &apos; hotel ?
and we &apos;re coming here on valentine &apos;s day ?
i hardly think the royal family would--
listen , estee ,
we are simply dropping by
so i can do one nice thing for a friend
before heading to the cardiac ball .
chuck bass is not a threat ,
and i think it &apos;s important for the world to see ...
chuck , what are you doing here ?
just leaving . enjoy your evening , ladies .
see that ? we &apos;re friends now .
we &apos;ve put it all behind us ,
so feel free to alert the media if you want .
classy party , blair .
is this the type
of dignified function i can be looking forward
to attending with you in the future ?
trust me , we &apos;ll be leaving momentarily .
since bass seems to be the issue here ,
why don &apos;t i keep my eye on him ?
downstairs , with people not
wearing plaid or eating jell @-@ o .
hey , don &apos;t give me that look .
you said you didn &apos;t wanna work a party at &quot; the spectator , &quot;
so this isn &apos;t &quot; the spectator . &quot;
wait , wait , wait . just hear me out , okay ?
i think i did a pretty good job of addressing your concerns .
i mean , we &apos;re not having
some cheesy valentine &apos;s date here , okay ?
you get to see my world up close ,
maybe change your mind about it ,
and you don &apos;t have to miss work if you don &apos;t want to .
come on . just say a quick hello . you have to .
serena would kill me if she knew that i saw you
and didn &apos;t drag you upstairs .
no , dan , i told you , i really don &apos;t have time .
i need to go find lily--
no , it &apos;s too late . too late .
hey , look who i saw racing through the lobby
as i was listening to st. vincent ? good @-@ bye .
charlie , what are you doing here ?
and where have you been for the past three months ?
i know .
i just felt really overwhelmed and guilty about ...
the car accident ,
especially since chuck and blair were leaving my party
when it happened .
so i went back to florida .
but , uh , you know , honestly ,
i really shouldn &apos;t be here right now .
i came to apologize to your mom on my way to catching a flight .
do you have her room ?
i &apos;ll text her . don &apos;t worry about it .
but first you have to tell me
all about your past three months
and--and what it &apos;s like living with carol again .
excuse me .
sorry .
okay , okay .
what are you doing ?
hold still . serena really
digs that outsider thing .
so i &apos;m helping .
b.t.w. , this tie didn &apos;t work for you in high school ,
and it doesn &apos;t work now .
so here &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking .
take serena somewhere quiet ,
like--i don &apos;t know--
nate &apos;s room or something .
wait a second .
i really don &apos;t think i can go through with this .
you &apos;re really nervous , which is cute .
it is like high school all over again .
listen , you have nothing to worry about , dan .
serena already likes you . you know that .
look , i &apos;m telling you ,
just be your charming , wonderful self
like you &apos;ve been with me all year .
you think i &apos;ve been wonderful ?
are you kidding me ?
look at everything we &apos;ve been through together .
you kept it a secret when i found out i was pregnant .
you shielded me from the world
so i could deal with my paternity test ,
and you brought me to a priest in my darkest hour .
you wrote louis &apos; vows for him ,
and then you saved me from my own wedding .
do i need to go on ?
no .
so ...
if you &apos;re that guy with serena ,
how could she not love you ?
you gonna make your move or what ?
行动 ! 快亲她 !
i will be right back .
you really do . i mean it .
charlie , welcome back .
serena , can we talk ?
yeah , of course . promise to call me
the moment you get back from europe , okay ?
i will . promise .
charlie !
ivy ! ivy !
it &apos;s charlotte rhodes from florida .
we took that acting class together .
uh , yeah . charlotte .
hi .
it &apos;s good to see you .
what are you doing here ?
i was about to ask you that same question .
so ... dan is looking for you .
blair , that &apos;s not funny .
i &apos;m not joking . that was my big surprise .
unlike you , he thought your lunch date went great ,
and he wants to explore things further .
now i &apos;m leaving , so go find him and see what happens .
go !
georgina .
you &apos;re &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
what ? no .
no , that &apos;s the most ridiculous thing i &apos;ve ever heard .
oh . uh , okay . i &apos;m not ... &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i just ... i work for her ,
and believe me , the job is a lot harder than i thought .
okay , look , your blackmailing days are over .
if you tell anyone that
i leaked that video of blair and chuck at her wedding ,
then i &apos;ll tell everyone that you &apos;re gossip girl &apos;s henchman .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;re overreacting here ?
i mean , i was just trying to help your relationship along
by getting you to finally kiss blair .
i couldn &apos;t handle the lack of action any longer .
all those endless pauses and pained stares .
so boring .
she wants you to kiss her , too .
the fact that you haven &apos;t just done it already
would be shocking if you weren &apos;t , well , you .
dan .
georgina .
what is going on ?
everything &apos;s fine .
georgina was just leaving , weren &apos;t you ?
yes , i was . this party is so 2007 anyway .
what are you doing here ? aren &apos;t you supposed to be at some fancy gala ?
i still have this .
and i just need to know one thing .
i sent serena to look for you .
am i just setting her up for disappointment ?
do you really want us to get back together ?
i just want you to be happy .
tell me what would make you happy , dan .
wait . hey , georgina !
sorry , s.
looks like your seven minutes in heaven
just turned into seven seconds from hell .
charlie trout .
drinking by himself on valentine &apos;s day .
look out .
do i know you ?
yeah . alessandra .
we met at dan &apos;s book party .
i have a vague memory .
well , it &apos;s a good thing i have a vivid one .
i &apos;m here with a bunch of single girlfriends ,
and it is super depressing .
buy me a drink .
unless ...
forgive the drunken brazenness here ,
but ... what do you say we head off to your room
and make the rest of this dreadful holiday
go away together ?
thanks ...
but maybe last year .
oh , my god . what is wrong with me ?
i was trying to get you two back together .
i thought that &apos;s what you both wanted .
it &apos;s not my fault he kissed me .
not your fault ?
what , you sound like you &apos;re still in high school .
says the girl in the constance uniform .
did you not believe me that i didn &apos;t send that video in ?
of course i believed you .
okay , well , then what is it ?
what , you just wanna take away something that matters to me ?
did you even care about dan ?
b , how many times can we fight like this ?
aren &apos;t you sick of it ?
they say people keep fighting about the same things
until it breaks them apart .
you know what ? maybe we &apos;re there .
there you are . we really have to go .
i couldn &apos;t agree more .
the last thing my mother ever wanted
was for me to be an actress ,
let alone live in new york city ,
so i applied to julliard behind her back .
now , well , she thinks i &apos;m busy rushing sororities
in michigan state , and i &apos;m actually here ,
taking classes and going by &quot; lola . &quot;
just working jobs like this one
to make ends meet .
but what about you ? are you acting out here ?
yeah . yeah , kind of .
i mean , you know , i @-@ i got cast in this one part ,
and it paid really well ,
but it took a lot longer than i expected ,
and it was way more complicated than i thought .
all right , has anyone ever told you two
how much you guys look alike ?
i mean , you could almost be sisters .
my mom used to say the same thing .
you remember her , don &apos;t you ?
no . no , not really .
and i didn &apos;t realize how late it was getting .
so i &apos;m going to go .
you know , we should exchange numbers sometime .
well , i &apos;d say an apology is in order
after all your &quot; i &apos;m not comfortable in your world &quot; talk ,
because you totally knew someone at my party .
yeah , you &apos;re right . you &apos;re right . i stand corrected .
but why was ivy dickens here anyway ?
oh , she &apos;s my friend &apos;s cousin .
her real name &apos;s charlie rhodes .
i &apos;m sorry . &quot; real name &quot; ?
yeah . you didn &apos;t know ?
apparently , her mom is a crazy woman down in florida
who made her go by the name &quot; ivy dickens &quot; growing up .
it must have been when you knew her .
but after last spring when she moved here
to live with her family ,
she had to go by her real name .
and that name is ... charlie rhodes ?
yeah . what ?
dan , give it--
give me one good reason why i shouldn &apos;t just smash
this phone on the floor right now ?
fine . no problem .
i &apos;ve already e @-@ mailed myself the picture anyway .
doesn &apos;t matter .
you can &apos;t do anything with it anyway ,
&apos;cause the second you do , we &apos;ll just out you
as the &quot; gossip girl &quot; spy you are .
i &apos;m not her spy , you idiot .
i am her .
watching you and blair squirm with unfulfilled desire
is way more fun than any damage one picture could cause .
what does that mean ?
it means that the girl you love finally gave you a sign
that she likes you back ,
and there &apos;s not a damn thing
either of you can do about it
without destroying not only blair &apos;s marriage
but her family &apos;s entire financial future .
her family ? i don &apos;t understand .
she didn &apos;t tell you about her prenup ?
if blair defaults in her marriage in any way ,
the dowry she &apos;d owe would bankrupt eleanor .
and , sweetie ,
if blair hated you for being poor before ,
imagine how much she &apos;d hate you for making her poor , too .
i have something i think you &apos;d like to see .
and in your bedroom , no less .
has she no decency ?
anyway , happy valentine &apos;s day .
blair ! blair , wait a second .
just give me one more minute , okay ? sorry .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about the prenup ?
is that why you went back with louis ?
i just can &apos;t risk my family &apos;s future like that .
i have no choice but to stay trapped in my marriage
for at least a year .
so your feelings for louis ...
are all business .
how about your feelings for me ?
because that kiss-- it wasn &apos;t like last year .
you--you kissed me back . i felt it .
doesn &apos;t matter what you think you felt ,
because serena &apos;s my best friend ,
and i would never do anything to hurt her .
i &apos;m sorry if i gave you the wrong impression .
have a happy valentine &apos;s day .
amazing .
you got exactly what you wanted .
so what are you waiting for ? use it .
if i post this picture , dan will out me .
and i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m willing to give up being &quot; gossip girl &quot;
over one little kiss .
so what are we gonna do ?
dan knows how blair feels about him now ,
which means the more they can &apos;t ,
the more they &apos;ll want to .
it won &apos;t be long before
they &apos;re doing far worse things than kissing .
speaking of ...
i &apos;m kinda digging this whole high school look .
oh , well , it is valentine &apos;s day , and you have been
uncharacteristically helpful today .
sure . why not ?
oh , not it .
i know i promised you all i &apos;d expose a giant secret today ,
and i didn &apos;t deliver ,
but isn &apos;t that what valentine &apos;s day is all about ...
hopes dashed ? feelings hurt ?
relationships severed ?
it &apos;s a day filled with crushing disappointments .
i want you to know i &apos;m interested
in more than your body , alessandra .
i &apos;m interested in your work , too .
tell me , what &apos;s it like being a book agent
and working with my good friend dan ?
where it &apos;s easy to take advantage
of the vulnerable and lonely .
while some continue to pine
over those great unrequited loves .
others can &apos;t help
but feel like they somehow got totally screwed .
how was your aunt ?
unfortunately , i wasn &apos;t able to finish it .
how is she doing ? is she okay ?
i &apos;m worried there &apos;s not much time left .
she really cares about you .
wouldn &apos;t stop talking about you while you were gone .
mrs. rhodes is up right now if you &apos;d like to talk to her .
and while it &apos;d be nice to believe
that most valentine &apos;s days end well ,
we all know they are far more likely to end in heartbreak .
