pain in the ass . sit down .
don &apos;t mind him .
he &apos;s hungry is all .
you , uh ,

uh , no , i &apos;m sorry , i don &apos;t have--
would--would you like a banana ?
banana ?
yeah .
stop ! let me go !
8 &apos; 49 &quot; .
good god , that &apos;s not even close .
why does it have to be such a fast mile ?
have you ever even had to run a mile in the field ?
no .
i &apos;m not even in the field .
i sit at a computer on my perfect posterior ,
like all day .
maybe we should ask morgan for help .
no .
but he has really good abs .
yes , he does .
but it &apos;s bad enough
some bureaucrat is making us take this stupid test .
the last thing we need is
mr.universe talking smack the whole time .
but he knows about all this stuff .
he can probably , like .
teach us some tricks , help us train .
yes , but he takes it way too seriously .
i worked out with him once .
you work out ? that &apos;s cool .
yeah .
i don &apos;t .
in a non @-@ traditional manner
and never again with him .
he was all , &quot; there you go , baby girl .
move it or lose it .
this ain &apos;t your high @-@ tech room .
my grandmama can move better than that . &quot;
he can be enthusiastic at times .
that &apos;s a way of saying it .
but , no , me and you , we can do this .
me and you , we got this . a couple more laps .
here we go .
we got this . we got it .
1 !
1 !
2 !
2 !
let &apos;s do it .
信息内容 : 有案子了 办公室见
hallelujah .
what ?
we have a case ?
yep .
thank god .
race you to the bleachers .
we don &apos;t need him !
i &apos;m just gonna have a heart attack really quick .
all right .
come on .
you ok ?
yeah , why ?
&apos;cause you got a little gimp in your giddy @-@ up .
uh , it &apos;s these shoes . beauty knows no pain .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . wait a minute .
what are you doing ?
do i smell bengay ?
maybe . i had an active evening with sam .
i &apos;m ready , sir .
all right , let &apos;s get started .
oh , great .
ok . so , this morning , a wisconsin park ranger
discovered 3 partially buried bodies
in a forest preserve just outside milwaukee .
two male and one female .
he doesn &apos;t appear to have a gender preference .
decomposed . they weren &apos;t all killed at the same time .
and that is why i call you eagle eye .
preliminary m.e. reports
they &apos;d each been killed about a month apart .
the most recent victim , susan clark ,
has been dead approximately two weeks .
28 @-@ year @-@ old exotic dancer and prostitute .
high @-@ risk lifestyle . what about the other two ?
i haven &apos;t i.d. &apos; d them yet .
&apos;cause of death ?
still working on that , too .
looks like they were all covered in bite marks .
from the unsub ?
probably from critters out in the woods .
he murdered them months apart
but buried them all in the exact same spot .
the disposal site &apos;s obviously important to him .
susan clark was reported missing 6 weeks ago .
there were long @-@ term ligature marks on her wrists and ankles .
he holds them captive before he kills them .
but what exactly is he holding them for ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
wheels up in 30 .
no ! no ! no ! no !
please ! stop !
please let me go .
drink . you don &apos;t want to get dehydrated yet .
what ?
hey , come back , please ?
sir !
come back !
what are you doing ? !
come back !
rabid
&quot; it is more important to know what sort of person has a disease
than to know what sort of disease a person has . &quot;
hippocrates .
my friends in an airplane , don &apos;t say i &apos;m not a giver .
i have i.d. &apos; d the first two victims .
coming to your tablets now .
first up , milwaukee resident melvin lewis ,
50 @-@ year @-@ old divorce and truck driver .
next we have rudy hightower ,
a 32 @-@ year @-@ old homeless iraq war veteran .
two caucasians and an african @-@ american .
this guy doesn &apos;t have a racial preference either .
there &apos;s still no connection between the victims .
maybe there is no connection .
they could be targets of opportunity .
and that means it &apos;s not about who he kills ,
it &apos;s about how he kills them .
or what he does before or after he kills them .
garcia , they determine the cause of death yet ?
negative .
each one of them was single and lived alone .
maybe he keyed in on that
knowing that they wouldn &apos;t be reported missing .
well , he &apos;d have to stalk them long enough to know that .
dave , you and reid go to the coroner &apos;s office ,
blake and i will coordinate with local p.d. ,
and , jj , i want you and morgan at the disposal site .
it took us almost two hours to get out here .
that &apos;s with you driving , too .
we passed another forest preserve
and a whole lot of space on the way .
there &apos;s plenty of spots to dispose of bodies ,
so why put all 3 right here ?
well , it &apos;s isolated .
that &apos;s good for him .
yeah , he may come out here to relive his handiwork .
well , there &apos;s no evidence to suggest
that he killed the victims here .
so he does his thing someplace else
and this is just the disposal site ?
well , he obviously has a vehicle , most likely a truck or a van .
that &apos;s risky for him , transporting the bodies all that distance .
more chances for him to get caught .
and it &apos;s a lot of work , too . you can &apos;t drive to this spot .
it &apos;s gotta be , what , 300 yards from here to the road .
you know , we could be close to where &apos;s he &apos;s keeping them hostage .
either that or it &apos;s something about this place . but what ?
well , if it is about the location ,
at least maybe we disrupted him .
now he can &apos;t come back here .
well , hopefully we can get to him before he tries to .
sorry about the wait .
we were collecting tissue and organ samples
to send to the lab .
here &apos;s my report .
you able to determine the cause of death ?
cardiac arrest , all 3 of them .
what caused their hearts to stop ?
that &apos;s why we &apos;re sending the organ samples .
tox reports ?
all negative .
any sign of sexual assault ?
inconclusive . they &apos;re too decomposed .
what about the bite marks ?
yeah . about 90 % of them are postmortem ,
from animals out in the woods--
a coyote , fox , maybe , or a raccoon .
and the other 10 % ?
that &apos;s where it gets weird .
they all had antemortem bites , too .
the first victim , melvin lewis ,
his were animal bites , but the others--
they were bitten by a human .
pretty viciously , too .
some of the wounds are deep .
chunks of flesh are missing . we found several .
total of 11 ?
you read fast .
were you able to obtain dna samples from any of the bites ?
no .
it could be a form of torture ,
maybe a biting fetish .
didn &apos;t know there was such a thing .
oh , you &apos;d be surprised .
we should also consider cannibalism .
when you get a moment ,
would you mind taking some bite molds for us ?
maybe that &apos;s why he holds them captive first .
if he &apos;s feeding on them ,
i &apos;d lay odds he &apos;s already got his next victim .
considering the specificity of the m.o. ,
the body count , and the timeline ,
i &apos;d say those odds are actually pretty good .
which one of you took it , huh ?
hello ?
get me out of here . please help me !
i &apos;m can &apos;t . i &apos;m locked in , too .
how long have you been here ?
hello ? !
i &apos;ll eat you .
i &apos;ll eat your face off .
i &apos;ll eat you alive !
sir ? excuse me , sir .
shut up !
what are you ...
what are you doing ?
i &apos;ll eat you alive !
get away from me !
no , no , no !
eat .
you &apos;ll need your strength .
what &apos;s with you ? you ok ?
yeah , i &apos;m great . i &apos;m just doing some stretching
bsecause it helps me keep my brain limber .
i &apos;ve also been doing some geo @-@ profiling .
the red markers indicate where the victims lived ,
except , of course , rudy hightower , who was homeless .
the blue markers indicate where they were last seen alive .
and this is the disposal site .
so that &apos;s his hunting zone .
which means he probably lives close by .
ok , so something &apos;s not adding up for me here .
here you go .
thanks .
if we are dealing with a cannibal ,
why does he dispose of the bodies ? why not keep them ?
well , it &apos;s not easy to keep a body fresh .
maybe he doesn &apos;t have the resources .
maybe he doesn &apos;t require large portions of flesh
to satiate his urges .
most ritual cannibalism involves the consumption of particular organs
as a means to commune with the deceased .
but none of the victims were missing any organs .
which means it &apos;s probably not about the ritual
but about the compulsion .
i don &apos;t know . he grabs them , he holds them captive ,
and then he buries them all in the exact same spot .
and how do we explain the first victim , melvin lewis ?
he didn &apos;t have any human bite marks .
sir , no , no , no ! hey !
no . pleas ... please listen . you don &apos;t even know me , ok ?
ok . ok , ok .
if you try to fight or run , you get the stick .
ok ! ok . ok .
on your stomach !
ok . ok .
don &apos;t move !
i &apos;m not ! i &apos;m not .
that &apos;s too tight ! it hurts .
it hurts . please .
help ! help ! please !
please !
please ...
please !
please , please ...
what are you ... what are you ...
what is this ?
talk to me !
will you please just talk to me ?
just tell me what &apos;s going on .
what are you doing ?
please !
is somebody there ?
i can hear you breathing .
what you got , sweetness ?
mama &apos;s hands are dirty &apos; cause she &apos;s been digging .
i got the 4 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 on our first victim , melvin lewis .
originally from the malibu of the midwest ,
sheboygan , wisconsin .
melvin moved to milwaukee 12 years ago
when wifey ran away with his best friend .
yeah . luckily they had no kids .
no criminal record . like super squeaky clean .
not even a parking ticket .
he joined facebook a year ago .
he has a whopping 6 friends , all from work .
he drives a truck , right ?
yeah . a milk truck , to be exact .
but only did that for a month .
before , he worked for 10 years at an animal control center ,
but he was laid off due to budget cuts .
what exactly did he do , garcia ?
he was a dogcatcher .
but like a s.w.a.t. team of dogcatchers .
he specialized in dangerous and trapped animals ,
including but not limited to skunks , a raccoon ,
and one time a giant python .
all right , thanks , babe .
that could be it .
what , the python ?
no , bite marks . of course .
that could be how he was doing it .
that &apos;s why it was undetectable .
brain tissue , we need to look at brain tissue--
ok , reid--
sorry .
i don &apos;t think this is a biting fetish or cannibalism .
i think it &apos;s a virus ,
and the biting is merely a means of transmission .
what kind of virus ?
there are several possibilities . creutzfeldt @-@ jakob disease ,
tick @-@ borne encephalitis , but the most likely culprit is rabies ,
and that wouldn &apos;t show up in an autopsy except in brain tissue .
so since lewis was the only victim not bitten by a human ,
the unsub must have used an animal to infect him first .
and after that , he somehow facilitated human to human transmission .
that would explain the random victimology .
it doesn &apos;t matter who he infects .
all he needs is a host .
which also means the holding period
isn &apos;t about torture , it &apos;s about incubation .
i was attacked by a rabid fox once .
shot the thing 3 times before it went down .
freakin &apos; terrifying . it was like a horror movie .
yikes . we need to have the m.e. test for rabies vectors
in the brain samples .
and then we need to deliver the profile .
based on the demographics of the area ,
we believe that we &apos;re looking for a caucasian male
in his mid @-@ 20s to late 30s .
we just received confirmation from the coroner &apos;s office
that each of the victims died from rabies .
two of the victims sustained significant human bite wounds ,
and dental records confirm
that those bite wounds came from other victims .
which means that somehow or another ,
he &apos;s facilitating biting attacks .
we think he &apos;s a sadist
who gets off on watching the attacks .
he may record them
so he can relive the event over and over again .
rabies has been around since the beginning of documented history .
it has the highest case to mortality rate in existence
and is arguably the deadliest disease known to man .
it &apos;s derived from a sanskrit word meaning &quot; to do violence . &quot;
carriers literally go stark raving mad .
uh , i thought there &apos;s a vaccine for it .
there is , but the post @-@ exposure prophylaxis is only effective
if administered within 24 hours of infection .
once the symptoms appear , the prognosis is death .
get off ! get off ! aah !
it &apos;s also contagious ,
so it &apos;s at great risk to himself
that he &apos;s chosen this method to kill .
which means it holds special significance to him .
he may have lost a pet or even a relative to the virus .
it is not easy to obtain a sample of the virus .
we think he most likely started with an animal .
so he may have worked at a veterinary clinic ,
maybe a pest control company .
what he &apos;s doing takes deliberation and patience
and is rooted in a need @-@ based desire ,
so he &apos;s not going to stop on his own .
thank you .
chris blythewood , 21 @-@ year @-@ old college student ,
and liz foley , 42 @-@ year @-@ old stay at home mom .
the only two people reported missing for the last month
within a 10 @-@ mile radius of the hunting zone .
pretty good chance the unsub &apos;s holding at least one of them .
so i went through the list
of vet offices and animal control employees ,
and nada . everybody &apos;s clean .
guys , i &apos;ve been doing some math .
based on the estimated time of death
and when the victims were last seen alive ,
it appears as though the first victim , melvin lewis ,
was held for a couple of months .
the second victim , rudy hightower ,
for one month , the third victim ,
susan clark , for only a couple of weeks .
so why is he taking progressively less time with these victims ?
he &apos;s getting more efficient ?
he may have found a way to shorten the incubation period .
and how would he do that ?
rabies attacks the nervous system .
it travels a few millimeters a day until it reaches the brain .
but if you were to infect the area around the head of the neck ,
the distance would be shortened .
he may be some sort of symphoraphiliac .
and instead of setting a fire or causing an accident
and watching the ensuing mayhem ,
he just wants to watch them die .
a rabies death is apparently quite the spectacle .
there are convulsions , spasms ,
then the madness sets in , along with uncontrollable salivation ,
which accounts for the foaming in the mouth
we all associate with the disease .
that sounds terrible .
it is .
and one of the cruelest ironies of all is the extreme dehydration
caused by hydrophobia .
victims have a visceral fear response to liquid of any sort .
add to that confusion , hallucinations ,
and you can probably imagine the horror .
please let me go .
my kids ...
we have money .
you know , if you call my husband ,
he &apos;ll do whatever you say .
we have a good--we &apos;re fine .
we--he &apos;ll do whatever you say !
he &apos;ll do whatever you say !
please !
please !
get away !
get out !
get it away from me !
come here . come here .
all right , now , come here .
out of the way . get it off of me !
uh ! get off of me !
no ! aah !
give it to me , dollface .
do you know that over 50,000 people die of rabies every year
in third @-@ world countries ?
thank god for monsieur pasteur , otherwise we &apos;d all be dead .
ok , so i looked into every known case of rabies exposure
in the country over the last 20 years .
did you find anything ?
cool your jets , hot chocolate .
i will let you know if i &apos;ve got something .
so i &apos;ve got something . 15 years ago ,
in a town called two rivers , wisconsin ,
a 9 @-@ year @-@ old , hunter cunningham ,
was admitted to the hospital with severe flu @-@ like symptoms .
symptoms get worse , he develops hydrophobia .
turns out that 3 weeks prior , he was bitten by a bat
when he was out camping with his family .
two rivers is less than a 2 @-@ hour drive from here ,
and it &apos;s even closer to the disposal site .
a bat . that &apos;s odd .
actually , bats make up 12 % of wisconsin &apos;s mammalian population ,
and they &apos;re responsible for
the majority of the infections in the u.s.
baby girl , what &apos;s so special about this hunter cunningham kid ?
here &apos;s what &apos;s special .
a week after he was admitted to the hospital ,
he checked out of the hospital .
but i can &apos;t find a death certificate .
it &apos;s like he disappeared .
what about his family ?
uh , his father patrick died 6 years ago of a massive heart attack .
and mom , wanda , works as a bartender at the tropicana hotel in vegas .
any siblings ?
yes , affirmative .
one older brother , david wade cunningham ,
28 @-@ year @-@ old resident of milwaukee .
and what &apos;s his deal ?
his deal is ...
ay , chihuahua .
he works at nassee pest control ,
which specializes in dangerous animal removal ,
and you don &apos;t even have to ask me ,
home and work address sent--bam !
how are you feeling ?
why are you doing this ?
you cold ?
yes .
that &apos;s from the fever .
please just let me go .
please ? please just let me go ?
i won &apos;t tell anyone anything .
i swear . just let me go , please .
mom . my mom .
i have to talk to my mom .
to my mom , please .
she just had heart surgery .
i have to . have to .
no , no , i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry . i just ...
just let me go . just let me go .
no , no , please , don &apos;t go .
please come back .
please , just come back .
please !
no ! no ! no !
please don &apos;t hurt me . please !
no !
you got to get out of here .
wait ! cut me loose ! cut me loose ! please !
no , come back !
it &apos;s clear here .
clear .
clear .
he &apos;s not here .
i think it &apos;s safe to say this guy &apos;s single
and not in a relationship .
guys , look at this .
i don &apos;t know , you think we got the right guy ?
all right , thanks , baby girl .
this cunningham guy got fired
from his last two pest control jobs .
probably for stealing equipment .
you know , i bet that &apos;s how he acquired
his first sample of the rabies virus , on his job .
the acquisition of the virus may have been the trigger itself .
it &apos;s worth mentioning , the only known rabies survival story
that didn &apos;t involve the vaccine
happened right here in milwaukee .
a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl survived the virus
when doctors put her in a medically induced coma .
you think it &apos;s connected to this ?
based on the sheer proximity , it &apos;s possible ,
but given the lengths to
which the unsub goes to infect his victims ,
i think it &apos;s unlikely .
hey , look what i found .
it was hidden really well in his closet .
he did not want anyone finding it and i think i know why .
please ! let me go !
i feel sick .
i really gotta go to the bathroom !
i gotta go !
hunter , look at me . buddy , it &apos;s gonna be ok .
david , what are you doing here ? get out of here !
turn that damn thing off .
1999--that was the year his brother hunter got rabies .
by the time they got him to the hospital ,
there was nothing the doctors could do .
it &apos;s possible the parents brought him home to die instead .
and then his big brother david recorded the whole thing .
he was 12 at the time .
that &apos;s an impressionable age
for a single event imprint .
it clearly unlocked some sort of psychopathic fascination
that he &apos;s still trying to satisfy .
i can &apos;t imagine
watching my own son die ,
let alone from rabies .
it almost makes you consider euthanasia .
i &apos;m not saying i would
advocate euthanizing henry or anything . i &apos;m just--
no , spence , that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s why garcia couldn &apos;t find a death certificate
for hunter cunningham .
because his parents must have done it .
they couldn &apos;t bear to watch ,
so they put him out of his misery .
where is she ?
gone .
when ?
when ? !
i don &apos;t know .
but i hope she goes straight to the cops
and they fry your ass .
she &apos;ll be dead soon .
and so will you .
well , why don &apos;t you go ahead and kill me , then , huh ?
why don &apos;t you just do it !
what are you waiting for ? !
yeah , do it , you sick son of a bitch !
kill me ! kill me !
kill me !
kill me !
never gonna happen .
devon &apos;s got ballet at 3 : 00
and i gotta pick will up at sports camp .
what &apos;s she got goin &apos; on ?
small soy chai latte for michelle .
that &apos;s me . thank you .
i just--i don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gonna make it work .
unless eydi can pick will up .
where is she ? !
ma &apos;am , is everything ok ?
where is she ? hmm ? tell me .
give it back .
now !
lady , you need to leave .
what do you want ? !
nothing .
you want something , whore ?
get off ! get her off me !
get off !
large cap , extra foam .
you want something ?
i &apos;m good .
thanks .
you know that forest preserve
he used as a dump site ?
there &apos;s a campground .
it &apos;s only a half hour from where david cunningham grew up .
he probably went there all the time when he was a kid .
we should probably search the area .
the body of the brother might be buried there , too .
were we able to reach their mother in vegas ?
she &apos;s on vacation in thailand . we left a message on her cell .
go ahead , garcia .
sir , another missing persons report just popped up .
25 @-@ year @-@ old grad student russell holmes .
you send us the info yet ?
si , senor . mom reported it .
she went in for heart surgery , he never showed up to visit .
all right , thanks .
a 911 call just came in .
some woman who &apos;s apparently foaming at the mouth
is attacking people in a coffee shop .
all units be advised , suspect is on foot
and was last seen headed north
at the intersection of marshall and east lyon .
i think morgan &apos;s closer .
got it , hotch . marshall and east lyon .
we &apos;re on our way .
hang on , guys .
where is she ? !
where is she ? ! aah !
hey , come on !
jan , let &apos;s go !
where is she ? ! give her back ? !
give her back !
i &apos;m gonna circle around the block .
wait . there .
i think that &apos;s liz foley from the missing persons report .
no , no ,
no .
there &apos;s too many people .
move everybody out while i get her attention .
fbi ! come on , we need to clear everyone out . let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go .
liz foley ! i need you to stop right there .
ma &apos;am , i need you to stay back .
you don &apos;t tell me what to do , i tell you what to do !
ma &apos;am , i said stop now !
you need to listen to me . stop right now !
i tell you--
her family &apos;s been notified .
they &apos;re gonna meet her at the hospital .
there &apos;s nothing they can do for her , huh ?
comfort measures , but that &apos;s about it .
thanks , officer .
we can &apos;t be far from where he &apos;s holding them hostage .
she was on foot .
but in her state , how in god &apos;s name did she escape ?
reid , where are we in relation to his hunting ground ?
right in the middle of it .
at your service , sir .
garcia , we &apos;re trying to figure out what kind of building or property
the unsub might be using . what do you see
in a 5 @-@ mile radius of our current position ?
a lot of stuff . what am i looking for ?
anything relatively isolated or industrial .
uh , it &apos;s mostly residential , single @-@ family homes ,
apartment buildings , stuff like that .
what about abandoned properties ?
not per se ,
but people don &apos;t usually give notice when they do that .
let me see if there &apos;s any condemned .
no , nothing .
what about properties for sale ?
let &apos;s see , 1 , 2 , 6 homes for sale .
all of them occupied .
an apartment building for sale , also occupied .
it looks like the city is selling some land .
what &apos;s there ?
uh , hold yourself . it is a ...
hello . it &apos;s an animal shelter ,
but it &apos;s shut down due to budget cuts .
that &apos;s could be it , garcia . send the address .
done and done . please be careful .
where are you ? i know you &apos;re in here .
i can hear you .
no ...
i &apos;m sick ! i need to go to the bathroom !
please !
please ?
let me go !
let me go .
i feel sick .
i really gotta go to the bathroom .
please !
please !
i gotta go !
i gotta go !
remember what i told you before .
yes .
repeat it .
if i run or fight , i get the stick .
go ahead .
all right .
s.w.a.t. &apos; s still 5 minutes out .
all right , we can &apos;t wait . we &apos;ll go in in two groups .
we &apos;ll go in this door ,
you guys take the west door down the alley .
let &apos;s go .
lay back down .
what are you doing ?
i said lay down !
ok .
david wade cunningham , fbi !
jj , you got him ?
go !
wait , ok . please help me , please , please .
we have the entire place is surrounded .
you might as well come out .
david ?
nice tackle , kid .
thanks . i &apos;ve been working out a little bit .
thanks , man .
pretty boy .
i hope they didn &apos;t mess up that face too bad .
you know that &apos;s your best asset .
luckily just some superficial nicks and bruises .
how are you doing ?
i just got a couple burns , but i &apos;ll be all right .
found another body at the disposal site .
hunter cunningham ?
well , we &apos;re still awaiting dna confirmation ,
but they &apos;re the skeletal remains of a 9 @-@ year @-@ old boy ,
so ...
it &apos;s gotta be him .
you guys ready to get out of here ?
yes , please . i can &apos;t stand hospitals .
it &apos;s something about the lighting .
who &apos;s rossi talking to ?
the foley family .
she slipped into a coma .
it won &apos;t be long now .
excuse me , agents ?
um , the doctors , they said that i &apos;m gonna be ok .
