good morning , puppy
hump day , am i right , jay ?
your day ends at 2 : 30
can &apos;t come fast enough .
quitting time . am i right , jay ?
let &apos;s not make this a thing .
whoa , whoa , whoa . what is this ?
where &apos;s my soft @-@ boiled egg ?
i scrambled it .
it &apos;s good for you to try new things .
i don &apos;t want to try new things .
you can &apos;t just spring this on me .
i have bad news , manny .
this is not the biggest curve ball
that life is going to throw you .
buddy , don &apos;t close yourself off from new things .
i ever tell you the story about me and crab cakes ?
thought i didn &apos;t like them , tried them , love them .
are the movie rights available for that one ?
dunphy spring classic .
who &apos;s gonna do the dishes for the next week ?
boys versus girls .
testosterone versus estrogen .
standing up to pee versus the squat .
phil , come on !
dad !
swing and a miss .
he &apos;s in her head , luke .
and boys rule and girls drool .
you drool all the time .
mom had to take you to a specialist .
i &apos;m still growing into my tongue .
hey , mom , can i go to the movies with robin ?
no , you may not , &apos; cause you are still grounded .
then can i be sent to my room ?
no , &apos; cause we &apos;re having some fun family time .
we &apos;re gonna spend this beautiful afternoon
outside in the fresh air , getting some exercise , okay ?
pitch it , phil .
oh , well .
that &apos;s the game .
what do you mean ? we just started .
that was our only ball .
so what ?
the game &apos;s over just because you &apos;re afraid
of stupid mr. kleezak ?
yep . i &apos;m not going over there .
that was fun .
if hannibal lecter and freddy krueger had a love child ,
he would be afraid of our next @-@ door neighbor .
i don &apos;t have a mean thing to say about anyone ,
but mr. kleezak is ...
not a nice person .
easy , honey .
hey , haley .
oh , hey , uncle mitchell .
hey , is your mom home ?
no .
she had to take alex to the oncologist .
oh , my god , what &apos;s wrong ?
she needed new glasses .
oh . did you mean optometrist ?
whatever .
so , should i give her a message ?
yes , yes .
could you ask her if she could possibly babysit
lily on saturday night ?
we &apos;d really , really appreciate it .
saturday night , we &apos;re having dinner
with pepper , longinus , and crispin .
they &apos;re our gay friends .
i think that was clear .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time
with a lot of straight people lately .
and , darling , i need a night with my homies .
you mean homos .
okay . yeah .
you know what ? maybe you should stay in and babysit .
yeah , our babysitter bailed ,
and we &apos;re kind of in a bind , so --
i can do it . i can watch lily .
i &apos;m really good . i &apos;m babysitting luke right now .
oh , yeah ?
you want -- you want to babysit lily ?
oh , well , that &apos;s very sweet , honey ,
but you &apos;re -- you &apos;re a very popular girl .
i &apos;m sure you have better things to do , so --
oh , seriously , i &apos;m totally free .
being grounded is so much worse than it was in the olden days .
my friends text and facebook
all the fun stuff they &apos;re doing
while i &apos;m stuck at home playing jenga with my dad .
are you serious ?
you don &apos;t even have to pay me .
i promise i &apos;ll take super good care of her .
okay , well , that would be great . thank you .
yes , well , we &apos;ll see you on saturday night .
bye , sweetie .
bye .
luke ?
luke ?
what are you thinking ? !
haley is a very sweet and fashionable girl ,
but seems hardly a responsible caregiver !
well , you know what ? we needed a sitter .
she &apos;s family .
i say we give her a shot .
a shot ? oh , with our only child ?
sure , why not ?
if something goes wrong ,
we &apos;ll just pop over to the orient and grab another one .
what ?
my name is luke dunphy . i live next door .
what do you want ?
i want to get our ball from your yard .
i don &apos;t want you messing around back there .
just go home .
are you going scuba diving ?
why do you have that tank ?
you being smart ?
you mean in school ? well , i do okay .
my teacher says i get distracted .
why do you have that tube in your nose ?
for fun .
really ? can i try ?
it &apos;s oxygen .
we have that in our house ,
but we don &apos;t need tanks .
oh , for god &apos;s sake , just get your ball .
okay .
oh my god .
i was watching the news ,
and another flock of birds fell out of the sky dead .
what is happening ?
sweetie , you got to stop watching the news .
that &apos;s your big solution -- embrace ignorance ?
what are you two arguing about ?
never mind , i don &apos;t want to know .
be back in a couple hours .
whoa , whoa , whoa , where you going ?
to my friend walt &apos;s house to watch &quot; high noon . &quot;
ooh , i love westerns -- the bloodier , the better .
that &apos;s my favorite type of movie --
that and anything set against the backdrop
of competitive cheerleading .
is walt the one who &apos;s always skateboarding ?
no . where would he put his oxygen tank ?
okay , now i &apos;m really confused .
you sound like walt .
he gets confused a lot . it &apos;s hilarious .
wait , are we talking about mr. kleezak ?
yeah . i went over to his house to get my ball ,
and we &apos;ve been hanging out .
you were in mr. kleezak &apos;s house ?
luke , that is not okay .
why not ?
he &apos;s really nice and funny .
listen to this joke .
okay , two krauts walk into a bar .
phil , this is not good .
honey , don &apos;t jump to conclusions .
let him finish the joke .
and one of them has a limp .
you may not go back to that man &apos;s house .
why not ?
because ... he &apos;s weird .
and not very nice .
yeah .
that &apos;s what you said about my friend oliver .
oliver .
oliver who almost burned down our garage ?
he likes to melt stuff .
like you &apos;re so perfect .
luke , i &apos;m sorry , but your mother and i
just aren &apos;t comfortable with this .
that &apos;s so unfair .
you don &apos;t even know him
&apos;cause you &apos;re two afraid to talk to him .
buddy , we &apos;re just looking out for you .
you never like any of my friends .
we &apos;re doing the right thing .
absolutely .
aren &apos;t we ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , he makes a point .
we don &apos;t know the man ,
and little kids can be friends with old people , right ?
of course they can . there &apos;s tons of examples .
&quot; up , &quot; um , &quot; gran torino , &quot; &quot; true grit . &quot;
cartoon , kills himself , she loses an arm .
we &apos;ve got to go talk to that guy .
now ?
yeah .
it &apos;s so dark .
okay , so , the numbers are by the phone .
there &apos;s food in the fridge .
i just changed her diaper , so all you need to do
is put her down in about a half @-@ hour
and not let a serial killer in the front door .
well , what if he &apos;s cute ?
then save him for us .
nobody in , nobody out .
oh , we &apos;re gonna be totally fine .
you just go get your gay on .
oh , it is on like donkey kong .
well , clearly it &apos;s not on yet , but it will be .
thanks . so , okay , come on . let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m telling you , kid ,
this is a concert you &apos;re never gonna forget .
greatest music in the world .
wait a minute . what &apos;s this ?
what do you mean ?
what are we seeing ?
the symphony &quot; the four seasons . &quot;
i thought we were seeing frankie valli and the four seasons .
no . no , it &apos;s vivaldi .
oh , crap . you mean nothing but instruments ?
i &apos;m out of here .
no , you &apos;re not out . you &apos;re in .
i hate this kind of music .
jay , you always do that .
every time we try something new ,
your first reaction is always no .
it &apos;s &apos; cause i &apos;m old enough
to know what i like and what i don &apos;t like .
what about the crab cakes ?
that was a fluke .
and i can &apos;t slather that boring music in tartar sauce .
so i have to try new things ,
like scrambled eggs , but you don &apos;t have to ?
you see what you &apos;re doing ?
you &apos;re tearing this family apart .
let &apos;s take it down a notch . you two go in .
have a great time . i &apos;ll see you later .
what are you going to do ?
i &apos;m gonna walk like a man , fast as i can ,
《 walk like a man 》 中的歌词
to that bar over there .
and if you knew frankie valli ,
you &apos;d be cracking up right now .
it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m telling you , john schneider was the one !
john schneider , from &quot; the dukes of hazzard &quot; ?
that was your first crush ?
oh , my god , yes . bo duke -- delicious .
he was a redneck who drove a car called the general lee
with a giant confederate flag on it .
that wasn &apos;t a turn @-@ off for you ?
look , i know it was all kinds of wrong ,
but the heart wants what the heart wants .
richard gere . oh , my god .
i &apos;ll be the officer . don &apos;t be a gentleman .
montgomery clift .
一生只拍过17部电影 四获奥斯卡题名 却没拿过一个小金人
who ?
don &apos;t do that , crispin . you &apos;re not that young .
anyway , my crush was gay . at least i had a shot .
you had a shot with montgomery clift ? how old are you ?
i will cut you like it was nothing , farm boy .
oh , see , i miss this .
wait . what about you , mitchell ?
um , okay , well , i @-@ i didn &apos;t know it was a crush
because i was only 8 at the time .
i knew when i was 8 .
everyone knew when you were 8 .
longinus , get up . we &apos;re switching seats .
okay , okay , back to me , back to me , back to me .
so , i had just seen &quot; st. elmo &apos;s fire , &quot; and --
oh , mitchell , look , it &apos;s your father .
ooh . that &apos;s your father ? he &apos;s cute .
okay , can you please turn it off for one second ?
ooh , he &apos;s all alone . invite him over .
yeah , that &apos;s not something we &apos;re gonna do .
relax , your dad knows you &apos;re gay .
he doesn &apos;t know i &apos;m this gay .
excuse us ?
oh , mr. pritchett !
jay ! jay ! yoo @-@ hoo !

oh , yeah , yeah . that was in my daddy phase .
yes , please , keep this up . this is fun for me .
fellas , how you doing ?
hey , dad .
hi , jay .
hello , daddy .

i &apos;m just getting a drink while gloria and manny see a show .
well , please join us .
no , i don &apos;t want to intrude .
he doesn &apos;t want to intrude .
you are not intruding .
i &apos;m just gonna watch the game at the bar .
he just wants to watch the game at the bar , so ...
oh , sit down . we &apos;re up by 25 with a minute to go .
well , maybe just for a minute .
okay .
so , what does a guy got to do to get a drink around here ?
nobody say anything .
justin , more booze .
oh , mitchell was just about to tell us
who his first boy crush was .
no , no , i wasn &apos;t .
let me bring you up to speed .
crispin &apos;s was joey mcintyre ,
whoever that is .
longinus said john schneider .
your name is longinus ?
i know . i never stood a chance .
cam &apos;s was richard gere ,
and i was monty clift .
well , at least yours was gay .
i mean , you might &apos;ve had a shot .
thank you .
crispin , up . i &apos;m sitting next to this one .
welcome .
he &apos;s right there .
all right .
mr. kleezak ?
mr. kleezak ?
it &apos;s open .
honey , he &apos;s not moving . is he okay ?
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
mr. kleezak ?
mr. kleezak ?
okay , look .
i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s breathing .
does he have a pulse ?
well , there &apos;s only one way to find out .
would you stop pushing me ? you do it .
i hate this .
i &apos;m gonna kill luke .
oh , my god . he &apos;s ice @-@ cold .
oh , my god ! ugh !
i &apos;m sorry . we thought there was something wrong with you .
sorry .
what ? !
we thought there was something wrong with you !
phil .
hi .
we haven &apos;t , uh , formally met . phil dunphy .
yeah , i know you .
you &apos;re the guy who just broke into my house and fondled me .
no . no . we were just concerned that you looked dead .
no offense .
well , what are you doing here ?
oh , um , our son , luke , told us
that you invited him over here to watch movies ,
and i &apos;m sure you could understand
why we would ... be concerned about that .
no .
phil .
you &apos;re doing great .
honey .
wait , are you saying that i &apos;m some kind of pervert ?
no .
probably ... not .
look , i didn &apos;t ask him to come over here .
i was minding my own business , like you should be .
okay .
but in all fairness , our son is our business .
well , then , keep him .
and keep your daughter from driving into my garbage cans .
i --
and keep your blinds closed
when you &apos;re doing your little sexy dance .
oh , god , he &apos;s seen my sexy dance .
so i &apos;m 12 years old
i was staying over night at my best friend jim &apos;s house ,
and neither one of us want to go to sleep .
i know where this is going .
you &apos;re better than that , crispin .
so , we sneak off to the movies ,
and we see this little picture called &quot; solomon and sheba . &quot;
and sheba was ...
gina lollobrigida !
bingo !
and for the rest of my life , i swore , one day ,
i would marry gina lollobrigida .
well , dad , you kind of did .
i hear that !
mmm . these are good . what &apos;s in them ?
it &apos;s a margarita with a shot of absinthe .
absinthe makes the heart grow fonder .
ohh , are you making a bad pun or just lisping ?
i can &apos;t believe i drove all the way to the valley
to pick you up .
justin , more booze !
haley , hi . is -- is everything okay ?
yeah , why ?
because i just saw a man walk through the living room .
what ? where are you ?
i can see through the camera on the computer .
you &apos;re spying on me ? oh , my god .
oh , my god . that is so lame .
look , i don &apos;t know what you think you saw
maybe the tv , or the reflection ,
or maybe you think that my body &apos;s just shaped like a boy ,
like i don &apos;t have hips or something .
no , no , no , no . you have a @-@ a darling figure .
i was just concerned that
that hurts so much .
this is the kind of thing that i expect from my mother ,
but not from my cool uncle ,
so thank you for all of your trust .
okay , i &apos;m -- sorry . sorry .
unbelievable .
you got to go .
okay .
yeah . all right .
thank you . thank you .
dad , i &apos;ve never seen you sing before .
well , you never saw me in the shower .
and don &apos;t anybody go there .
when i was 12 years old ,
my father walked into my bedroom and caught me doing
the most embarrassing thing that a boy can do --
dancing to madonna &apos;s &quot; lucky star . &quot;
and from that moment on ,
there &apos;s always been a part of me that i &apos;ve kept from him .
and yet , yeah , here he was ,
you know , laughing with my friends .
and ... i don &apos;t know .
maybe the problem was me .
rob lowe .
where ?
where ?
where ?
where ?
no , no , rob lowe from &quot; st. elmo &apos;s fire . &quot;
that was -- that was my crush . i loved him .
i get that . he was a good @-@ looking kid .
right ?
yeah .
hey , &quot; walk like a man &quot; ?
well , i can sing it , but i can &apos;t do it .
i think i just broken somthing .
ow !
nurse !
hello ?
please tell me that you have my shoes .
why would i have your shoes ?
because i left them at your uncles &apos;s house last night .
what ? how could you leave without your shoes ?
i go a lot of places without shoes .
i &apos;m not wearing shoes right now .
oh , wait .
that &apos;s &apos; cause i left them at your uncles &apos;s house .
this is a disaster !
well , maybe they &apos;ll think they &apos;re theirs .
they &apos;re gay . they know what shoes they own .
thanks a lot , walt .
you couldn &apos;t be nice to my parents for two seconds ,
so now i &apos;m not allowed to hang out with you .
what do you want from me ?
i thought you were my friend .
you promised to teach me how to grow tomatoes ,
and you were gonna take me for an egg cream .
forget it . you &apos;re a little kid .
i don &apos;t need the aggravation .
oh , sorry i &quot; aggravated &quot; you .
and , just so you know , a lot of people think i &apos;m adorable .
i can &apos;t open this .
maybe if you had gone to the concert instead --
could you open it , please ?
i would , but i &apos;m old enough to know
that i don &apos;t like opening aspirin bottles .
hello ?
hey , dad !
how do you guys do it ?
i thought cops could drink .
listen , i just -- i wanted to say
i had such a good time with you last night ,
and i wanted to -- -hey , hold on . i got call waiting . yeah .
yeah ?
woof , not a morning person . good to know .
listen , i &apos;m five away .
i hope you like blueberry scones and dusty springfield .
who is this ?
pepper , silly .
it &apos;s gonna be a scorcher in the desert today ,
so dress accordingly .
oh , this is your street . see you in a minute .
holy crap !
that friend of yours , that pepper .
he &apos;s on his way over here . why ?
well , you made a date with him last night . don &apos;t you remember ?
i think i would remember if i made a date with a guy !
i &apos;m telling you , i know a guy in palm springs
who has every single vintage record known to man .
i &apos;m driving out there tomorrow . come with me .
it &apos;s a date !
all right !
i was drunk .
i &apos;m not going shopping with priscilla , queen of the desert .
okay , dad .
well , i &apos;m feeling really good about our relationship ,
and i want to hold on to that for a little while longer ,
so i &apos;m gonna go ahead and hang up with you .
give pepper a big kiss for me .
gloria , now , listen .
i know that you &apos;re upset with me about that concert thing ,
and rightfully so , but you have to help me .
what is it ?
it seems i made plans with mitchell &apos;s friend pepper .
that &apos;s someone &apos;s name ? pepper ?
yes , and that &apos;s just the tip of the iceberg .
there &apos;s another guy named longinus .
but pepper &apos;s gonna be here any second .
he &apos;s gonna take me to palm springs
to go shopping for records .
now , when he gets here ,
can you pretend there &apos;s some kind of an emergency ?
can you do that , please ?
iay , jay !
i @-@ i think you &apos;ll have to take me now to the hospital .
my head is in pain .
do you mean like that ?
yes , thank you .
okay , it &apos;s showtime .
and with this guy , i mean that literally .
i &apos;m here !
oh , my god .
what i could do with this house .
hello , jay .
chop , chop -- it &apos;s a two @-@ hour drive ,
not counting our stop at the outlet mall .
oh , okay . um , gloria , we &apos;re leaving !
hello . you must be pepper .
ay , ay , ay .
my head .
what &apos;s the matter , gloria ?
oh , nothing .
i just had a little ice cream . huh ?
he hasn &apos;t stopped talking about you all day long .
you are stunning .
how rich are you ?
are you sure you &apos;re all right , gloria ?
i feel great , mi amor .
i am so happy that he &apos;s doing this with you ,
because i never get him to do anything different ,
like the vivaldi , hmm ?
i think he likes you more than me .
you two have a great time together .
all right , but we got to be back early ,
because , you know , i got that work thing .
no , no , i canceled everything . you don &apos;t have anything .
you can spend all day long with him .
wonderful . well , shall we ?
oh , my god . tallulah ! oh !
don &apos;t worry . she &apos;ll stop yapping when she gets on your lap .
alex , honey , come on . we &apos;re gonna be late .
a herd of cows dropped dead for no reason .
i &apos;m not going anywhere .
get your affairs in order , people .
this is the end .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
there &apos;s nothing out there to be afraid of .
mr. kleezak .
i &apos;m not used to waking up with people poking me .
i was startled , you know .
we &apos;re really sorry about that .
yeah , well ...
these are onions from my garden .
wow . thank you so much .
that is so nice .
yeah , well , don &apos;t go throwing any parades .
they &apos;re onions .
i used to be a fireman , you know .
i don &apos;t hurt kids .
sir , would you like to come in ?
just tell the boy that &quot; shane &quot; is on today at 3 : 00 .
he should watch it .
maybe you could tell him yourself .
he &apos;s -- he &apos;s right upstairs . hang on .
luke , honey , come on down !
your friend ... walt is here .
this is just so sweet .
yeah .
well , just don &apos;t start dancing .
people can surprise you .
you get used to thinking of them one way , stuck in their roles .
they are what they are .
i was young at the time ...
and then they do something that shows you
there &apos;s all this depth and dimension
that you never knew existed .
are you talking about rob lowe ?
i &apos;m just saying he &apos;s a very versatile actor .
i think his good looks have actually held him back .
well , i can relate to that .
haley !
we need to talk .
i know i freaked out on you last night ,
but you have to see it from my point of view .
you were totally spying on me .
i know .
you were invading my first @-@ amendment right to privacy .
we were .
i &apos;m sick and tired of people not trusting me .
i get it .
and especially you guys .
i don &apos;t think of you guys as my uncles ,
i think of you as my friends .
and if your friends don &apos;t believe in you ,
then what else do you have ?
dylan &apos;s shoes ?
please don &apos;t tell my mom .
