&quot; the storm breaks tonight . &quot;
&quot; the storm breaks tonight . &quot;
he &apos;s planning a prison break .
we got a tunnel .
3 more prison breaks in 3 different states ,
all organized by rawdon &apos;s partners
from his last bombing attempt .
how many got away ?
as of right now , 13 serial killers .
so we have to catch them again .
i can &apos;t ... i can &apos;t ...
water .
water , please .
what do you think , chief ?
i don &apos;t know .
do we need to call in the fbi ?
i don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s been , what , 3 years ?
officer dewey .
yes , chief .
shut up .
how is he ?
you need to see this .
dewey .
yes , chief .
call the fbi .
manos , arriba .
arriba !
i &apos;m from the bronx , lady .
you want to do this in spanish , no hay problema ,
pero estúpido porque tú no habla español .
you have it ?
en ingles ? yes .
slowly .
on the hood .
everything you need to pass as a mexican citizen .
driver &apos;s license , passports ,
even an imss card in case you need a doctor .
but you ordered two .
you mind ?
we good , sugar ?
all good , baby .
that &apos;s half of what we paid for .
where &apos;s the other half ?
i &apos;m going to reach into my back pocket . but ...
i &apos;m not pulling out out a gun .
this way .
you take that , you come out on the other end
just outside of socorro .
you &apos;re coming with us .
that wasn &apos;t part of the deal .
it is now .
guess i &apos;ll go first .
no .
babe , you go down first , wait for us at the bottom .
then you go . i &apos;ll bring up the rear .
i don &apos;t know , it &apos;s dark down there .
your cell phone has a light . use it .
get going .
where &apos;d you escape from prison ?
make a difference ?
not as long as i get paid .
honey , how we doin &apos; ?
carla jean !
i &apos;m good . i &apos;m down .
can we send down our boy ?
yeah , baby .
send him down .
wait .
babe , turn your light on
so we can see down at the bottom .
show me the damn light .
good ?
fbi !
don &apos;t move !
you know , you didn &apos;t need to risk it .
we had sharpshooters on you .
yeah . shooters miss .
wait a second .
i mean , i know everything is digital now ,
but i still like to do this old school .
how many we got left ?
well , let &apos;s see .
13 serial killers escaped from prison in may .
with your help , we &apos;re down to 5 .
so how come you &apos;re not on our team full @-@ time ?
yeah , i told agent hotchner , i &apos;m a manhunter .
i &apos;m no good to you as a profiler .
you &apos;re with the fbi &apos;s fugitive taskforce .
from where i &apos;m standing , you &apos;ve done us a whole lot of good .
rossi , i appreciate the offer . i do .
but i can &apos;t sit around brainstorming about these guys .
i need the chase .
fair enough .
oh , we think he &apos;s back in tempe .
he , uh , let a survivor go this morning .
in an arm spreader .
daniel cullen .
when do we start ?
we just did .
chief , how much do you know
about daniel james cullen ?
you mean the crimson king ?
i know he liked to cut words into his victims &apos; bodies .
3 years ago your phoenix field office arrested him .
that &apos;s why we didn &apos;t call you in last time .
has his most recent victim said anything ?
he just woke up .
brian , these folks are with the fbi .
would you mind ?
do you know what it means ?
yes , we do .
te crimson king
&quot; anger is my meat . i sup on myself .
and so shall starve with feeding . &quot;
william shakespeare .
then we visited the louvre and the eiffel tower ,
and the best part of all was that on the flight back ,
mom walked me through every moment of it .
i didn &apos;t have to prompt her .
oh , spence , that &apos;s so great .
the latest research shows that diets high in omega @-@ 3 fatty acids
help combat dementia ,
which we gorged on in paris .
i mean , honestly ,
if she hadn &apos;t been clinically diagnosed with alzheimer &apos;s ,
i &apos;d just think she was a little absentminded .
so are you gonna keep her in the same facility ?
yeah , she really likes it there .
what did i miss while i was gone ?
tell me about agent alvez .
uh , well , um , let &apos;s see ,
he bounced between different divisions
before joining the fugitive taskforce .
former army ranger , right ?
covered most of iraq &apos;s worst hellholes .
he &apos;s a first in , last out kind of guy .
what does garcia think about him ?
good morning .
uh , how was your weekend ?
i don &apos;t really discuss my personal life with my co @-@ workers .
really ?
yeah . i keep it real low @-@ profile here .
if you must know ,
i hung out with my boyfriend ,
who is super hot and awesome and totally in love with me .
that &apos;s cool . you guys go out or ...
no . we stayed in and he helped me
with some fingering techniques .
for my clarinet , which i practice and he helps me ,
and this conversation is making me uncomfortable ,
and i &apos;m sorry , i must go .
agent hotchner needs me .
i made lasagna .
i do not care .
that &apos;s the last batch , guys .
garcia , did the pictures come through ?
yes , sir , they are coming in loud
and disconcertingly clear .
so this is it .
you compare pictures of the old victims
with pictures of the new victims
and see what &apos;s different ?
hotch .
you see it ?
yes .
see what ?
garcia , we need everybody .
will do .
what do you guys see ?
luke alvez .
oh , hi . i &apos;m dr. spencer reid .
ah . no handshaking , right ?
your , uh , reputation precedes you .
so does yours . it says here that
you caught our next fugitive ,
daniel cullen , 3 years ago .
during his sentencing statement
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t kill because i don &apos;t have to . &quot;
he sounds like an injustice collector .
how &apos;d you finally catch him ?
cullen was always a suspect . we just couldn &apos;t get an i.d.
so , uh , my partner went deep cover , and ...
we caught him in the act .
after i heard how he broke out in may ,
i wanted to be the one to put him away again .
there might be a flag on that play .
go ahead , hotch , we &apos;re all here .
the details of the cullen case are all the same except for one .
the cuts on the latest victim are shallow
and show definite hesitation marks .
it doesn &apos;t make sense . from his first victim ,
cullen inflicted as much pain as possible .
and prison would have made him mean .
they &apos;re not nice there .
brian phillips doesn &apos;t match cullen &apos;s previous
injustice collector victimology ,
and the message at this time is &quot; bau &quot;
when we had nothing to do with his initial arrest 3 years ago .
so , look , maybe he met someone in prison
and told them all about us , but more likely--
this isn &apos;t daniel cullen .
it &apos;s a very sophisticated copycat .
agent alvez , this isn &apos;t the case you signed up for ,
but your history with it will still be an asset .
if someone &apos;s out there copying cullen ,
it could still lead us to him ,
and i want in on that .
i need everyone to look for
any other discrepancies between the copycat and cullen .
tara &apos;s gonna interview the latest victim
and see what he remembers .
does it itch ?
so bad .
when i was 12,
i came home from summer camp
and two of my closest friends ,
they had moved away .
it was the first time i noticed how quickly life can change .
you think you &apos;re one thing
and then you &apos;re something else .
and now i &apos;m this .
this trauma , yes , it &apos;s a part of you .
but it is not all of you .
help us catch the man who did this
and you can take back control of your life .
how ?
walk me through it . ok ?
two days ago , you clocked out from work .
where did you go ?
straight home . uh ...
but the door was unlocked .
before i could even think , they came .
that &apos;s not right .
i was out . just ... gone .
and when i woke up , i was on a table .
i couldn &apos;t see anything .
why not ?
there was ...
like a white plastic bag .
no . no , that &apos;s not right .
it &apos;s ok .
your mind makes jumps ,
and then you try to fill in the gaps .
but ... just let it come .
it was a mask .
like a gas mask ,
but it was painted white .
no , that &apos;s not right . i &apos;m wrong .
it was black .
but that &apos;s the second time
that you &apos;ve mentioned white .
so what are you trying to remember ?
the smoke .
the smoke was white .
and then i heard him speak .
are you ready ?
breathe it in .
there you go .
now you &apos;re ready .
tell me , what is your name ?
brian .
my name ... is brian .
no , you &apos;re not brian .
and then i passed out
because that &apos;s when he started cutting .
ok .
tell me about the smoke .
what about it ?
what did it smell like ?
what did it taste like ?
if we can figure out what it was ,
we can screen for it in your system .
bubble gum ?
bubble gum ?
that sounds crazy , but i swear it ...
yeah , it was like bubble gum .
it doesn &apos;t sound crazy at all , brian .
off of bubble gum ? for real ?
we &apos;ve seen the use of aerosolized drugs before .
one called scopolamine puts you in a catatonic state .
the other , sevoflurane , is used during dental surgery .
it puts you in a suggestible , almost hypnotic trance .
and because it &apos;s used in dental surgery ,
it tastes and smells like bubble gum .
and that &apos;s why we think the unsub is this guy .
mr. scratch .
peter lewis .
he was one of the key players in the breakout .
looks like you get to hunt a fugitive after all ,
just not the one you thought .
but i &apos;m bumping on two things .
number one--
peter lewis should be doing everything he can to stay hidden .
and number two--
if he &apos;s going to surface again ,
why would he copy another guy &apos;s style ?
he obviously has some agenda
that &apos;s not clear to us yet .
but we need to consider a more pressing problem .
peter lewis is a math genius .
which means he plans for every variable .
why is that more pressing ?
every serial killer thinks that .
yeah , but most of them operate out of compulsion and he doesn &apos;t .
he would stress test all permutations of his plan before reappearing ,
most likely on other victims .
you think we &apos;re missing someone .
he wouldn &apos;t release brian
unless he knew we couldn &apos;t catch him .
here i am , the paragon of professionalism .
garcia , have there been any suspicious murders
in the tempe @-@ phoenix area after brian ?
outside of the usual drug and domestic abuse violence , no .
check 911 records , any missing persons reports ,
psychotic episodes , delusions .
i &apos;m gonna check the prank phone call bin to be sure .
what is it ?
i &apos;ve got a call here about a jennifer jareau
that caller listed the address as 54321 rossi avenue .
wow , this guy is really baiting us , isn &apos;t he .
ok , it came from a burner phone ,
but they left the gps on .
i &apos;m sending you the address now .
no . send it to hotch and tara .
but let them know that peter lewis
left the breadcrumbs on purpose .
they could be walking into a trap .
police .
hotch .
hotch .
hotch .
hotch ?
hotch .
hotch .
hotch .
i &apos;m hotch .
hotch . hotch .
her name &apos;s chelsea carter .
that &apos;s a complete dissociative break .
we &apos;re still trying to figure out what connects her to brian .
other than being a year younger , nothing .
well , peter lewis found a
shared mental condition he could exploit .
that &apos;s his victimology .
last time he dosed men and women
who had made false accusations of satanic ritual abuse ,
but that was in the mid @-@ 1980s ,
and brian and chelsea are both far too young
to have lived through that hysteria .
then they share a different condition .
well , these are all heavy @-@ duty anti @-@ depressant
and anti @-@ psychotic drugs .
this one &apos;s for ptsd .
now play out the scenario .
someone like her inhales peter lewis &apos; drugs .
what &apos;s he trying to induce ?
we need to build the profile .
thank you very much .
that was chelsea carter &apos;s psychologist .
he confirmed that for the past 15 years
she suffered from dissociative identity disorder .
d.i.d. ? you &apos;re talking split personality .
technically , it &apos;s an updated diagnosis
for multiple personality disorder .
both of our victims shared the same diagnosis ,
and brian has it , too .
that &apos;s a small victimology pool .
one that &apos;s localized here .
the university of tempe has a summer camp
that helps kids with dissociative disorders .
and garcia &apos;s contacting all the doctors and administrators .
it &apos;s got to be where he &apos;s finding his victims .
yeah , but what does d.i.d. get him ?
he wants to manipulate their identities ,
and he wants a violent one .
that means peter lewis is not the copycat .
it &apos;s someone with d.i.d. who he dosed .
so he &apos;s telling this alternate to cut his victims
like the crimson king ,
and he would need to keep dosing him
to maintain the illusion .
peter lewis never liked to kill .
he always got others to do his dirty work for him .
here &apos;s the thing . d.i.d. is a difficult disorder to treat ,
but it &apos;s even more difficult
for a third party to control .
to succeed with this kind of experimentation ,
he would have had multiple failures .
we are seeing that . brian survived the torture ,
and chelsea &apos;s mind snapped from it .
it begs the question , though--
why didn &apos;t brian go crazy ?
yes , ok , yes . i had d.i.d.
it doesn &apos;t matter .
yes , it matters .
i haven &apos;t had a break since i was 12 .
it &apos;s not who i am anymore .
but that summer camp that you went to ,
did a chelsea carter go there ?
yes .
yes , she ...
what happened ?
is she dead ?
she was also attacked .
this guy &apos;s trying to induce a dissociative break .
so i need you to tell me who your alternate identities are .
what ? no , absolutely not .
how can you even ask me that ?
because it will help us with our investigation .
they &apos;re girls , all right ? !
my ...
my alternates were two little girls .
they made me feel better when i got stressed out .
and i swear to god , if you laugh at me--
brian ...
i &apos;m not laughing .
you know what integrative therapy is ?
yes . it &apos;s also called unification therapy .
it &apos;s the best known treatment for d.i.d.
when a patient recognizes his alternates
as extensions of one whole .
that &apos;s what they taught me at camp .
and those two friends you told me about ,
the ones that moved away ?
yeah , that was them .
i need you to confirm the names of the other kids
that went to camp with you ,
because they could be his next victims .
it &apos;s been so long .
i can remember faces , but ...
if i got you a list of patients ,
could you try to pick out the names you recognize ?
maybe .
i mean , i could try .
yeah .
you got a second ?
yeah , sure .
may i ?
yeah .
have a seat .
so i &apos;m up to speed on all the fugitives this team is hunting ,
which means i read up on
all of peter lewis &apos; victims .
and , i saw that--
i was one of them .
yeah . i don &apos;t want to know what happened .
i just want to know ...
don &apos;t you want to kill him ?
do you want to kill daniel cullen ?
i took an oath
to uphold the laws of this country .
so ...
yeah .
yeah , i want to kill him .
why ?
you read my personnel file .
i want to hear your version .
ok . all right .
anyone that asks ,
i tell them that we caught him in the act .
which is true .
what i don &apos;t tell them is that the act
that i caught him in
was him cutting open my partner ,
who he somehow figured out was fbi .
&quot; try not to flinch . &quot;
phil told me later that &apos;s what he said .
i strongly believe
that men like daniel cullen and peter lewis
belong in 5 @-@ foot by 8 @-@ foot cells
where they can live out their lives as failures ,
instead of dying thinking that they accomplished something .
i &apos;m not there yet .
let &apos;s talk about right now .
i wanted you on this case
because i know that you &apos;re driven to find cullen .
i know that you &apos;re a good tracker .
if there &apos;s something in this profile
that you &apos;re not agreeing with ,
i &apos;d like to know what it is .
you &apos;re not gonna like it .
then everybody should hear it .
you can &apos;t analyze a fugitive &apos;s actions on the outside
without taking into account what he did on the inside .
so what did peter lewis do on the inside ?
nothing . he was a model prisoner .
no , it goes further than that .
he had no contact with other convicts .
he didn &apos;t join or get pressured into a gang .
when he gets out , he picks up as if no time had passed .
so he had the resources in place before we arrested him .
a safe house to stay in ,
backup supplies of his drugs .
he could have gone anywhere in the country .
i mean , anywhere in the world , probably .
then he came here . to tempe , arizona ?
he had the highest concentration of targets with d.i.d. here .
you said he wouldn &apos;t reveal himself
until his plan was foolproof .
right ? this isn &apos;t foolproof .
brian and chelsea have been failures .
but what part of his plan has worked ?
us .
you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
most fugitives , they do everything they can to stay on the d.l.
he &apos;s courted our attention from the beginning .
where i keep hitting a wall is why .
especially if he already has a list of all the kids
that went to that camp .
maybe we need to re @-@ evaluate our presumptions .
when peter lewis needed information before ,
he hacked quantico .
well , he can &apos;t do that again .
so maybe he &apos;s going to get his information from us .
and we &apos;re compiling the very list he would want .
we know all his tricks .
we &apos;re not gonna give him the list .
the police aren &apos;t . how is he gonna get it ?
brian .
i asked officer dewey to go over the list with him
once garcia had something .
oh , god , hotch , i &apos;m so sorry .
‭ yes , sir .
garcia , don &apos;t distribute the list .
but ... i just hit send .
todd emerson ?
no .
dustin anderson ?
yeah .
when you hear the names you remember ,
this is what you &apos;ll do .
this is what you &apos;ll do .
i need a moment .
ok .
try not to flinch .
he took his phone .
peter lewis has the list .
tara , there &apos;s no way we could have predicted this .
we &apos;re shooting this bastard on sight .
chief , if you do that ,
we lose our best lead on peter lewis .
i don &apos;t care .
you will care when he kills more people .
let us do our job .
well , now we know who the copycat is .
what &apos;s scientifically revolutionary
is that peter lewis isn &apos;t just inducing
an already existing alternate ,
he &apos;s actually creating one .
brian thinks he is the crimson king .
that &apos;s undocumented in d.i.d. literature .
it is possible with the right balance of drugs and torture .
peter lewis never tortured before .
he does mentally ,
by hypnotizing his victims into self @-@ harm .
it explains brian &apos;s shallow wounds .
tara , you mean he cut himself ?
it was all there in the story that he told me .
i just didn &apos;t see it .
d.i.d. is usually the result of trauma .
if peter lewis could build an alternate like this
through hypnotic suggestion , it means that brian
has some propensity for psychopathy in his past .
tell me , what &apos;s your name ?
brian .
no . you &apos;re not brian .
you are the crimson king ,
and you &apos;re going to cut into brian .
lewis , did you locate the parents ?
yeah .
all right . see what kind of history you can get from them .
the rest of us need to look at every clue again
through the prism of brian as trojan horse .
where &apos;s the evidence room ?
so , this .
why would peter lewis make brian wear it ?
so we wouldn &apos;t question that he was a victim .
it worked , huh ?
cullen hand @-@ made his .
peter lewis knew that .
knew enough to copy the lock bolt mechanism .
not enough to sew it himself .
a machine stitched this .
so he had to order it .
ready and waiting .
garcia , we need leather experts
in the phoenix and tempe area .
yeah , i think the leather
experts might have asked too many questions .
garcia , if you don &apos;t mind checking sex shops
and bdsm specialists , the more extreme the better .
garcia ?
i will send agent alvez that list now .
good @-@ bye .
did you turn off the gps ?
very good .
come in .
how can i help ?
brian &apos;s parents are gonna be here in a few minutes .
can you sit in on the interview and just ...
make sure i don &apos;t miss anything ?
i will .
and you won &apos;t .
now listen to me very closely .
brian was always a sensitive child .
we did our best .
can you keep him from hurting himself ?
or anyone else ?
we &apos;re going to try ,
but he &apos;s wanted for the murder of a police officer .
what do you need from us , agents ?
we need to ask you about brian &apos;s d.i.d.
and where it started .
we adopted brian , through our church .
it was a closed adoption .
when we received him , he had these ... scars .
the pediatrician told us that
somebody in the foster care system
had smashed bottles across him
and then cut him with the jagged glass .
was he ever violent ?
only toward himself . he would ...
cut open his own scars .
and then he would , uh , go into like a chant .
like a mantra .
we thought he was self @-@ soothing at first .
and then we realized that he was talking like--
girls , right ?
who were they ?
well , we think that they were in the foster care with him ,
that they would help him , you know ,
feel better after he &apos;d been hurt .
ok , this is very important .
what would he say when he talked like them ?
yeah . this guy
ordered this arm spreader .
two of them , actually .
two of them ?
so where &apos;s the other one ?
could i see your badge again ?
yeah . is there a problem ?
yeah , ok , the guy who ordered them ,
the name he left on the invoice was dr. spencer reid .
did he pay with my credit card also ?
cash . i knew he was sketchy .
guys like him give s &amp; m a bad rap .
which is why i did ask for a copy of dr. reid &apos;s driver &apos;s license ,
which he gave me happily .
we &apos;ll need to see that right now .
亚利桑那州坦佩市埃迪森大街4679号
he was all up in your business , boy wonder .
he used your social security number
to do a change of address and everything ,
哥伦比亚区达沃大街30980号
but , speaking of addresses , we have a local one for him .
good . get that information
to the rest of the team and the police , please .
we need to assume he has the same level
of personal information for the entire bau .
and daniel cullen .
but we ruled out his involvement .
now i &apos;m not so sure .
peter lewis copied a specific detail of cullen &apos;s arm spreader ,
one that wasn &apos;t in a public record .
the only way he could have gotten it
is if the real crimson king has been a part of this all along .
i have to go .
but i &apos;m leaving you with a gift .
who is he ?
his name is daniel cullen .
he thinks he &apos;s the crimson king .
what will you do about that ?
reid , luke , the police are 10 minutes out .
that could be a problem . if the police try to convince brian
he &apos;s not the crimson king , he could get unstable .
guys , we might have a solution .
try to keep brian calm . we &apos;re on our way .
fbi ! drop the weapon !
no . no .
help me .
the crimson king doesn &apos;t kill .
he doesn &apos;t have to . remember ?
that &apos;s right .
you kill and it &apos;s over .
but if you let him go , he has to live the rest of his life
as a failure . isn &apos;t that what you really want ?
no . that &apos;s not good enough .
no one is gonna hurt you
like that ever again .
back off ! i mean it !
we can &apos;t do that .
ok ? someone told you to do this .
but this isn &apos;t who you are , is it ?
we know that .
no one is going to hurt you like that ever again .
nobody hurt me , i hurt them .
yes , they did hurt you .
they cut you when you were little .
and then right here on this very table ,
you saw your own blood and you didn &apos;t know what to do ,
so you became the crimson king to protect yourself .
no one is gonna hurt you like that ever again .
no one is gonna hurt you like that ever again .
do you remember eliza ?
angelica ?
what they used to say to you at the foster home
to calm you down ?
no one is going to hurt you
like that ever again .
do you promise ?
yeah . i promise .
brian , this is for your own protection , ok ?
we &apos;re taking you into custody ,
for your safety .
tara ?
yeah ?
oh , my god , what did i do ?
i &apos;m going to be with you every step of the way .
all right ? i &apos;m not leaving your side .
just take me to the place
♪ just take me to the place
where you will be
all right ...
i &apos;m gonna ride with him downtown .
ok .
hey . good job .
thank you , both of you .
no , don &apos;t thank us .
you &apos;re under arrest .
ok . for what ? what did i do ?
must have dosed him to make him lose his memory
so we couldn &apos;t get any answers out of him .
no , we &apos;ve met . 3 years ago .
what &apos;s my name ?
what &apos;s my partner &apos;s name ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re faking it .
luke .
you &apos;re faking it .
what &apos;s your name ?
what &apos;s your name ? say it .
i don &apos;t know .
tell me . please .
it might not be permanent , right ?
he might get his memories back .
he might .
i &apos;ve obsessed about this for so long .
but now , the way it went down ,
i just feel ...
you know .
i try not to think about the ones i &apos;m going to catch .
i prefer the think about the ones i &apos;m going to save .
you don &apos;t want to catch peter lewis ?
of course i do .
brian was just a test case .
he &apos;ll do this again .
we have the same list . we &apos;re contacting everybody on it .
but you &apos;re right . he will try to do this again .
if you want to help catch him ...
yeah , i would .
given his resources and the depth of his planning ,
we need you full @-@ time . it &apos;s a commitment .
you &apos;ll have to take a full profiling load , too .
to 500 hours ?
560 .
let &apos;s do it .
welcome to the team .
thanks .
i will take the stairs .
no , no , no , no , you won &apos;t .
because you &apos;re gonna have to get used to me .
all right ? i &apos;m now ssa luke alvez
