she &apos;s crawling ! emma &apos;s crawling !
he &apos;s bleeding ! joey &apos;s bleeding !
i &apos;m sorry . you &apos;ve gotta see this . i &apos;m gonna go get monica and chandler .
monica ! chandler !
come over ! come over ! hurry up ! hurry up ! hurry up !
what ? what ?
shaving ?
no , rabies .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s emma . she &apos;s crawling .
wow , look at her go .
give her a second .
joey , joey .
oh , sorry
i can &apos;t believe how fast she &apos;s growing up . it seems like only yesterday she was ..
farting on my lap .
not so funny when someone does that to you , is it ?
emma , come on . show everybody how you were crawling .
come on , emma
i think we &apos;re distracting her . let &apos;s everybody be still for a minute .
who &apos;s painting us ?
the.one.with.the.boob.job
have you seen our bank statement ? can this be right ?
i know . god , i haven &apos;t seen my savings take a hit like this ..
since i was a kid and they came up with double stuf oreos .
what happened to all of our money ?
i &apos;m not sure exactly what they did ..
but i &apos;m inclined to blame enron .
with you doing the internship , we &apos;re spending more than we &apos;re bringing in .
yeah , maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .
but you &apos;re finally doing something that you love .
i mean , i can &apos;t ask you to give that up .
although it would be nice if the thing that you loved was finding gold .
you know , i think we &apos;re making too big a deal out of this .
we &apos;ll pay our bills late this month . next month we &apos;ll cut back on a few things .
and maybe we start eating out of joey &apos;s refrigerator for a change .
you &apos;re a chef . what can you make out of baking soda and beer ?
worst @-@ case scenario is , we borrow some money from my parents .
or , you slipped on ice at their house last month . can we sue them ?
no , and we &apos;re not borrowing money .
why not ?
we don &apos;t do that . we are bings .
if there &apos;s one thing my father taught me , it was ..
well , to always knock before going into the pool house .
the other thing is , never borrow money .
i had no idea you had this much pride .
that &apos;s right , i do . i am your man . i &apos;m gonna get us through this situation ..
even if it means you working twice as hard .
you know , it &apos;s just really weird .
you don &apos;t like eating animals , but you love watching them tear each other apart .
no , i don &apos;t .. get him . get him !
separate the sick one from the herd !
i &apos;m gonna go .
why ?
i haven &apos;t been home in days , and i need to get more clothes .
you don &apos;t have to go . i have something that &apos;ll fit you .
i put that tube top on as a joke .
i want you to stay .
i want to stay too .
but i &apos;ve got as much use out of these boxers as i can .
why don &apos;t you turn them inside ..
done it .
i &apos;ll be back in a couple of hours .
all right . i &apos;ll miss you .
me too .
oh , fine . yeah , you got away .
but don &apos;t look so smug . you &apos;re gonna bleed to death .
you know what ? i just realized something . i don &apos;t want to go home .
great ! okay , i &apos;ll go get the tube top .
no , no , what i mean is ..
i hate going back to my apartment now .
partly because i live above a known crack den ..
but , you know , mostly because when i &apos;m there , i really miss you .
so ..
do you want to move in together ?
wow , mike hanigan ..
you sure know how to make a girl say &quot; hell , yeah . &quot;
so we &apos;re doing it ?
yeah , let &apos;s do it . let &apos;s live together .
we &apos;re really gonna move in together ?
yeah .
i &apos;ve always wanted to live with a guy .
pick up your socks . put down the toilet seat .
no , we are not having sex anymore .
it &apos;s gonna be fun .
shame on you , tv guide .
a man &apos;s ass is not nudity !
hey , joey .
hey .
listen , i need to know that what i &apos;m about to ask you ..
will never get back to chandler .
i &apos;d be lying if i said i hadn &apos;t thought about it myself .
but chandler is my best friend . it would be wrong .
good , but wrong .
okay , first of all , it would be great .
but that &apos;s not what i &apos;m here to talk to you about . i need to borrow money .
oh , i don &apos;t know , monica . you know ..
lending friends money is always a mistake .
but chandler lent you money .
and he would tell you it was a mistake .
come on , i just .. i need it for some rent and some other bills .
well , how much ?
two thousand dollars ?
two thousand dollars ?
what do you think i am , a soap opera star ?
yeah .
that &apos;s right , i am .
promise me you &apos;ll never tell chandler .
it &apos;ll really hurt his pride .
chandler ? pride ?
i know , he thinks he has it . it &apos;s really cute .
hi , you guys .
hey .
what &apos;s in the bag ?
you know how emma started crawling ?
i realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby ..
so i went to the store and i got some stuff to baby @-@ proof the apartment .
oh , god , baby @-@ proofing .
why is it such a big deal now ? you know , when i was a kid , it was like :
&quot; whoops , joey fell down the stairs . &quot;
or , &quot; whoops , joey electrocuted himself again . &quot;
anyway , are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff ?
no , i was just gonna do it myself .
you &apos;re gonna do it ?
yeah . why ?
you don &apos;t think a woman can do this ?
women can . you can &apos;t .
monica , will you please tell joey that he is a pig .
you &apos;re a pig . and you can &apos;t do this .
what ?
what ? come on , i found the hardware store all by myself .
the store &apos;s right down the street .
there is a hardware store right down the street ?
hey , you guys ? okay , we &apos;ve got great news .
phoebe and i are moving in together .
congratulations .
i know , it &apos;s so exciting . you know , i &apos;ve never lived with a guy before .
well , it &apos;s just like living with a girl , only they don &apos;t steal your makeup .
unless they &apos;re playing &quot; this is what my sister would look like . &quot;
yeah , she &apos;s not so cute .
i &apos;m gonna go to the bathroom .
well , you put down the toilet seat .
yes , dear .
is that a bit you guys do ?
uh @-@ huh . we &apos;re playing you two .
we don &apos;t do that . tell her we don &apos;t do that .
yes , dear .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re moving in together . i &apos;m happy for you guys .
i mean , he &apos;s a great catch . and those eyes ..
i &apos;m a scientist . i observe .
gosh , this is so exciting ! you guys are really moving along .
i hear wedding bells .
monica , slow down , okay ?
i &apos;m just excited to be living with him .
you know , i mean , i don &apos;t know ..
can i see someday being married to mike ? sure . yeah .
i could picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress ..
that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way .
but do i want that house in connecticut near the good schools ..
where mike and i could send little sophie and mike jr . ?
oh , my god , i do .
i had no idea you were so conventional .
i know . i guess i am .
oh , my god , load up the volvo , i want to be a soccer mom .
you ready to go ?
yeah , you bet , roomie .
don &apos;t you mean &quot; groomie &quot; ?
honey , leave the terrible jokes to me .
what are you talking about ?
please .
we haven &apos;t even moved in yet , and they have us picking out china patterns .
china patterns !
this is easy . &quot; can &apos;t do this .. &quot;
wow , seriously . can &apos;t do this .
hey , joe .
hey .
you here with somebody ?
no .
look , i need to ask you a favor , and we can &apos;t tell monica anything about it .
i thought you guys didn &apos;t have secrets .
that will remain the official party line .
look , monica and i are having a little financial trouble .
yeah , i know .
what ? what do you mean , you &quot; know &quot; ?
i just figured it out , you know ?
i mean , you &apos;re not working , and the economy is bad .
oh , right .
that is the fastest i have ever thought .
anyway ..
i need to borrow some money .
oh , sure . yeah , how much ? two thousand dollars ?
yes , $ 2000 exactly . how did you know that ?
i know how much you used to make , and i know how much your rent is .
oh , okay .
i am on fire .
listen , this is really nice .
did you write a check to monica for $ 2000 ?
did monica borrow money from you ?
kind of .
i can &apos;t believe her .
did she tell you we were having money problems ?
no , no , no . it wasn &apos;t because of your money problems .
it was for something for her .
what ?
something personal .
what would she get for $ 2000 that she wouldn &apos;t tell me about ?
excuse me .
boob job .
what ? that &apos;s ridiculous . she doesn &apos;t need a boob job .
why wouldn &apos;t she tell me about it ?
she was afraid you wouldn &apos;t be supportive .
i &apos;m not .
she knows you well .
you can &apos;t tell her that you know . i swore i wouldn &apos;t tell .
a boob job ? she doesn &apos;t need that . that &apos;s crazy .
well , it &apos;s not that crazy , okay ?
making them smaller , that would be crazy .
hey , so where do you keep your secret box of porn ?
i don &apos;t have any porn .
back of the closet in my bedroom .
oh , hey , i wanted to ask you about monica &apos;s little &quot; groomie &quot; joke .
well , i think the reason people laughed is that it &apos;s a play on the word &quot; roomie . &quot;
i get the joke . sophisticated as it was .
no , the thing i want to say is ..
maybe we should &apos;ve talked about this before .
us living together , you &apos;re not expecting a proposal , right ?
oh , no , no . not at all .
okay .
we &apos;re just moving in right now . we &apos;ll see where it goes .
yeah , well , that &apos;s the thing . for me , it &apos;s as far as it can ever go .
what do you mean ?
look , phoebe , i ..
i love you very much . but i never want to get married again .
wow .
it &apos;s just , my first marriage was ..
you know , such a disaster that i kind of lost faith in the whole idea .
was it that bad ?
at one point , near the end ..
she deliberately defecated on my ..
okay , well , that &apos;s bad . yeah .
but don &apos;t you think it might be different with someone else ? perhaps ..
a blond who always uses the toilet ?
except for once in the ocean .
look , it &apos;s not about who i would marry .
i was certain the first time i got married it &apos;d last forever . i was wrong .
but , it just ..
look , phoebe , it &apos;s not about you .
i just never want to get married again .
i &apos;m sorry .
are you okay with that ? if not , maybe us moving in together isn &apos;t the best idea .
no . oh , i definitely don &apos;t want to get married .
i just wanted to make sure you didn &apos;t want to , too .
because if we move in and you start changing your mind ..
there is gonna be hell to pay , mister .
trust me . i will never ..
yeah , i get that . yeah .
hi . so you gave in and decided to call someone ?
yeah . i don &apos;t know who i was kidding . i can barely use chopsticks .
you &apos;re all set .
oh , thank you so much .
wait . you forgot your ..
game .
thank you .
rach , is this my sweater ?
yeah .
what happened to the sleeve ?
moths ?
hey , rach . there she is , my perfectly proportioned wife .
don &apos;t look at me . i never get his jokes .
thank you ?
no , no . don &apos;t thank me .
thank you . do you know there is not one thing i would change about you ?
not one single thing . and definitely not ..
two single things .
okay , you &apos;re being weird . do you want sex , or did you do something bad ?
no . no . no . i just love the way you look . i am warm ..
for your form .
okay , you know the old classics like , you know , &quot; you look nice &quot; ?
they &apos;re still okay .
but &quot; you look nice &quot; could mean that i &apos;m saying , &quot; your face looks nice . &quot;
i want to compliment your body .
i mean , i wouldn &apos;t change it at all .
and more specifically , i wouldn &apos;t want anything to get any bigger .
okay .
i mean ..
you wouldn &apos;t want any part of me to get any bigger , would you ?
don &apos;t answer that .
just when you thought that dude couldn &apos;t get any weirder .
why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , what brought that on ?
oh , my god . you know what , we &apos;re trying to get pregnant ..
so he &apos;s probably starting to freak out that my body &apos;s gonna change .
you think that &apos;s what it is ?
you heard him .
&quot; no bigger . you &apos;re perfect . just don &apos;t get any bigger . &quot;
my god , he sounded just like my high @-@ school wrestling coach .
i &apos;m gonna have to talk to chandler .
yeah . if you don &apos;t , i will .
of course your body &apos;s gonna change . your breasts are gonna get bigger ..
your ass is gonna get bigger ..
you &apos;re gonna lose bladder control .
god , it &apos;s just such a magical time .
hi . listen , i wanted to ask you something about marriage .
now you &apos;re seeking me out to make jokes ?
i mean , i can see if we &apos;re all hanging out , but to come to my home ..
no , i really want to know how you feel about it .
why ?
mike doesn &apos;t ever want to get married .
never ?
never .
wow . are you still gonna move in with him ?
i want to , but i wanted you to tell me that marriage really isn &apos;t that big a deal .
you know , that i won &apos;t be missing out on anything . that marriage stinks .
yeah , marriage stinks .
i mean , if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving ..
get them married .
that &apos;s not how you really feel , is it ?
no , i &apos;m sorry .
i know it &apos;s not what you want to hear , but i can &apos;t help it . i love marriage .
seriously , you ? &quot; divorce @-@ o &quot; ?
if you have to call me a name , i &apos;d prefer &quot; ross , the divorcer . &quot; it &apos;s just cooler .
look , i know my marriages didn &apos;t exactly work out ..
but , you know , i loved being that committed to another person .
and carol and i had some good times before she became a lesbian .
and once afterward .
anyway , i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay . that &apos;s how you feel .
but , come on , i mean , living together will be great .
i mean , you guys have so much fun . and you love mike .
i do love mike .
yeah , see ?
and you were so excited about moving in together before ..
and you know what , you should be . it &apos;s a big deal .
yeah , i guess you &apos;re right .
yeah , thanks . this helped . thanks .
the divorcer to the rescue .
it &apos;s not cooler .
yeah , i just heard it .
rach ?
rachel ? !
so i can &apos;t do anything i like ? !
unbelievable .
chandler wants you to have a baby , but he doesn &apos;t want your body to change .
it &apos;s not like he &apos;s so perfect .
hey , that &apos;s my husband .
all right .
let &apos;s solve one problem at a time .
hey , rach .
perfection . wouldn &apos;t change a thing . not a thing .
honey ?
yeah ?
about that .
i &apos;m going to change .
yes , but , honey , you don &apos;t have to .
i &apos;m gonna get bigger .
honey , i ..
i love your breasts the way they are .
fascist .
my breasts are gonna get bigger whether you like it or not .
and it &apos;s not just my breasts . my ass is gonna get bigger too .
your ass ? !
and don &apos;t be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too .
they do that ?
it &apos;s kind of a package deal .
god , why ? why would you want to do that to yourself ?
i thought it was something that we both wanted .
if it means that much to you , i may be able to get onboard with the boobs ..
but the giant ass and the big clown feet ?
oh , my god , chandler .
if you can &apos;t handle this , what will you be like in the hospital ..
with the blood and screaming and the little person that &apos;s shooting out of her ?
what ?
joey , why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job ?
because she is .
chandler knows i borrowed the money .
for your boob job .
joe ..
it &apos;s over .
okay , so i &apos;m out $ 4000 and nobody &apos;s boobs are getting any bigger ?
hey . hey , what do you guys think about this : ross , the divorce force .
better .
yeah ?
very cool .
hey , phoebe ? you know , i &apos;m really glad you came to talk to me the other day ..
and i hope i was a little helpful .
yeah , you were helpful .
yeah . no , thank you .
good . good .
because the more i thought about it , the more i realized ..
i don &apos;t think marriage is necessarily the right path for you .
what do you mean ?
i know the other day in the coffeehouse ..
you were all caught up in the whole soccer @-@ mom thing ..
but is that really you ? i mean , can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo ?
they are awfully boxy .
people like me like stability and security . you don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s so incredible about you .
you got this wild and crazy life .
i mean , i don &apos;t know , you &apos;d be so bored with marriage . i mean , it &apos;s so normal .
yeah .
hey , can i help ?
well , we climbed up four flights of stairs , maneuvered a narrow hallway ..
dodged a rabid pit bull . but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .
you know , sometimes your words , they hurt .
hey , where do you guys want this ?
yeah , seriously , because this is really heavy .
i mean , not for me , because i &apos;m only pretending to hold it , but for these guys .
just one last time on the marriage thing . there &apos;s no wiggle room ? none at all ?
no , but you don &apos;t want to get married either , right ?
right .
except that i do want to get married .
couldn &apos;t have had this conversation down at the truck , huh ?
what ? you want to get married ?
someday .
and .. hernia .
i haven &apos;t had a normal life . and i never felt like i was missing out on anything .
but it feels like now it &apos;s my turn to have some of the regular stuff .
why didn &apos;t you say something before ?
i didn &apos;t know how much i wanted it . and i love you , and i wanted to live with you .
i want to live with you too . i mean , let &apos;s do that .
but i don &apos;t think i can .
it was okay to move in when i didn &apos;t know what was gonna happen .
but i can &apos;t move in knowing nothing is ever gonna happen .
i said to bring the cushions up first , but no .
can we at least try living together ? you might change your mind about marriage .
are you gonna change yours ?
no .
me neither .
i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want .
but i don &apos;t want this to end .
no , i don &apos;t want it to end either .
i can &apos;t believe this is gonna end .
i guess i &apos;ll have my stuff picked up .
yeah . okay .
okay , so ..
goodbye .
take it easy , mike .
bye , mike .
i &apos;m so sorry , phoebe .
we &apos;re all sorry .
look on the bright side . at least you won &apos;t have to live with this ugly chair .
that was here already , huh ?
i love you .
i did it ! i did it !
all right .
i &apos;d better take all i can carry .
