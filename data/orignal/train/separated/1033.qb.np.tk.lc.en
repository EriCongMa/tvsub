morning .
aren &apos;t you a little underdressed ?
oh , here we go .
is that better ?
perfect .
you know , one of the perks of living in new york city
is the casual exhibitionism .
oh , are the neighbors complaining ?
not yet , but the sale of binoculars
has gone up since you started coming over .
yeah ? perhaps after we eat ,
we can raise a few window shades .
all right .
mozzie ?
oh , lately he &apos;s been knocking in iambic pentameter .
or not at all .
neal !
peter .
really glad i dressed for company .
yeah .
yeah ?
locked door ?
there &apos;s a lot of crime in this city .
so i &apos;ve heard .
you &apos;re gonna love this .
there &apos;s this con man running around new york who --
you made breakfast .
am i not allowed ?
breakfast for two --
assuming that second plate isn &apos;t for me .
brilliant . you want to impress
me with any more of your detective skills ?
all right .
why did i ask ?
two fresh head imprints on the pillows .
champagne ice bucket at the foot of the bed .
romance is in the air .
that &apos;s -- yeah .
and this detective has decided to stop detecting .
let &apos;s see .
department issue ?
um , i &apos;m s-- those are mine . i &apos;m so ...
neal &apos;s teaching me how to pick them .
it &apos;s our version of sudoku in the afternoon .
morning , sara .
good morning .
and before you ask ,
i do not have a drawer here or a toothbrush .
did i ask ?
we &apos;re in that awkward , undefined stage
where , yes , we &apos;ve been on a few dates ,
but , really , what &apos;s that mean ?
what does it all mean ?
it means we &apos;re taking things one day at a time .
that &apos;s what i said .
more or less .
mostly more .
our next case awaits .
well , you two have fun .
no , no . - oh , no , no , no , no ! you don &apos;t have to --
it &apos;s ... bye .
bye .
bye , sara !
you should get dressed .
i &apos;m gonna eat .
yeah , please .
hurry up !
you can have both .
this guy &apos;s a skilled forger , safe cracker ,
lots of panache , and he &apos;s only 20 years old .
think we might be looking at the next neal caffrey .
he &apos;s a hacker . i don &apos;t hack .
you &apos;re right .
a neal caffrey for the new millennia , then .
when i was 20 , i didn &apos;t get caught .
we traced him to this apartment .
is he in there ?
there &apos;s movement inside .
yeah , i see it .
please tell me i get to break down the door .
why , when you ask so nicely ...
fbi ! hands in the --
cute .
you want me to cuff it ?
yeah , we should hold it for questioning .
why are you smiling ?
he &apos;s clever .
it casts a shadow on the door
and doesn &apos;t move in a fixed pattern .
he realized we were sitting on him and bolted .
looks like that .
they didn &apos;t have robot vacuums in your day ?
no , they didn &apos;t .
mm . look around .
he &apos;s got to have an escape route somewhere .
you &apos;re enjoying this .
i love tracking the smart ones .
now that you &apos;re on my side ,
i miss the challenge .
oh , come on , all he &apos;s done
are a few mildly impressive forgeries ,
allegedly cracked a safe ,
and stuck a vase on a roomba .
what ?
nothing .
boss , you need to see this .
what do you think ?
completely random arrangement of photographs ?
all right ... maybe he is good .
entrez , moz .
i &apos;ve come to steal your soul .
or at least part of it .
you know , i &apos;ve always found that superstition
annoyingly inconsistent .
yeah , i got to get to the office .
uh , this will only take a moment .
now , while i am disappointed we haven &apos;t been able
to recover peter &apos;s partial list of our treasures ,
there is a silver lining .
gives us time to perfectly prepare for our escape .
mm . starting with passports ?
how long do our aliases usually last ?
peter caught on to &quot; nick halden &quot; in two months .
&quot; steve &quot; survived for a year .
say &quot; gouda . &quot;
no .
imagine not having to look over our shoulders ,
not having to memorize a new date of birth
every few months .
i know where you &apos;re going with this , moz .
a permanent identity that the fbi can never crack
requires the birth certificate for a dead infant .
i &apos;m not doing it .
say &quot; brie de meaux . &quot;
what if there was a way to do it that wasn &apos;t so ...
horrifying ?
how &apos;s it work ?
you &apos;ll be stepping into someone else &apos;s shoes ,
even though they or their shoes never existed .
riddles , moz ?
neal ... trust me .
if there is a way ...
i &apos;m in .
excellent .
i &apos;ll set it up .
our suspect &apos;s name is scott rivers ,
and he &apos;s been on a criminal road trip .
so far , we &apos;ve been able to link seven of the items
in the photos to recent crimes .
we have a warrant for his arrest ,
but our guy is always in disguises .
he won &apos;t be easy to track down .
hey , how come you never used disguises ?
the right smile works just as well ,
and you don &apos;t have to worry that your mustache is on straight .
oh , this kid did the hartford mansion job ?
he steals items of incredible excess from the wealthy --
half @-@ a @-@ million @-@ dollar sunglasses ,
a solid @-@ gold toilet @-@ brush holder --
you get the idea .
and every crime he commits ,
he leaves this signature behind .
does he actually leave a donation ?
in the victims &apos; names ,
to a different charity each time .
so , robin hoodie here robs from the rich
and gives some to the poor .
robin hoodie ? i like it .
no , you don &apos;t . don &apos;t call him that , please .
well , you called him that .
it was a bad joke .
what can you tell us about him ?
he &apos;s a kid .
i mean , he likes shiny things , and he steals them .
he never had much money ,
but he was around people who did , and he resents them .
he &apos;s got morals .
these donation cards are a way to justify his thefts .
he &apos;s telling them how they should spend their money .
and he &apos;s cocky .
almost getting caught won &apos;t stop him .
will he get bolder ?
that &apos;s what i did .
okay . neal and i will dig into the donations
and the evidence from the safe house .
jones , diana , find out where
the rest of those stolen items came from .
let &apos;s try and figure out where this guy &apos;s gonna hit next .
hi , honey !
hey !
i , uh , saw you got a high score on &quot; angry birds &quot; today .
she knows you &apos;re here .
oh , i &apos;m not judging .
somebody has to stand up to those green pigs .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re working from home tonight .
so , what &apos;s the case ?
young con man stealing from new york &apos;s wealthy .
oh , a young neal ?
touchy subject ?
apparently .
it &apos;s not .
this is it .
this is the bank account
robin hoodie used to make the donations .
robin hoodie ? i like it .
he made a donation yesterday ,
but it doesn &apos;t link up to a robbery .
maybe something that he hasn &apos;t stolen yet ?
no , he needs to make the donation to get the card .
the theft has to come after that .
which means it could be happening any minute .
well , his donations definitely have a sense of humor .
he stole a half @-@ million @-@ dollar bottle of scotch ,
then donated to the betty ford clinic .
this one &apos;s to an organ @-@ donation charity .
maybe he &apos;s stealing a rare church organ .
play on words .
organ donation -- makes you think of ?
driver &apos;s license . organ donor .
he &apos;s gonna rob the dmv ?
there &apos;s no real pattern to the things he steals .
it &apos;s everything from a diamond @-@ covered cellphone to --
what about a motorcycle ?
hospitals call them &quot; donorcycles . &quot;
他们的器官在其死后大多被捐献出来
it &apos;s worth a shot .
let &apos;s find out who owns
the most expensive motorcycle in new york .
lock it up .
mr. stewart , we suspect
you &apos;re about to be the target of theft .
that sucks .
we &apos;re serious .
you recently bought a high @-@ end motorcycle ?
no .
you didn &apos;t ?
i bought a confederate fighter , okay ?
联盟斗士 : 高端摩托 全球仅售一百二十台
calling it a motorcycle is like
calling the queen of england a rich old lady with a funny accent .
but it &apos;s still a motorcycle .
dude , this is so much more .
have you ever had 100 grand between your legs ?
actually , yes , i have .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
we &apos;d like to set up a command post here to catch the thief .
not gonna happen .
my confederate party &apos;s in four hours --
for this confederate .
you really like saying &quot; confederate , &quot; don &apos;t you ?
confederate .
who knows about the party ?
everybody .
it &apos;s the perfect opportunity for the theft .
my security rocks .
no one &apos;s stealing anything from here .
you want to make a bet on that ?
hell , yeah .
i bet you i can steal something worth ...
10 grand in the next two minutes .
if i do , you let us come to the party .
sure . why not ?
is this a joke ?
you &apos;re running out of time . you only have ...
a minute left . i know .
how much would you say this is worth ?
10 grand ?
oh , at least .
i get it .
you didn &apos;t say i have to give it back .
give it back .
fine . you can set up here .
i got the fbi at my beck and call ?
everybody &apos;s gonna love this .
no , the whole point of a covert sting
is to not tell people .
no one can know we &apos;re here .
in that suit ?
right .
i &apos;ll be in the surveillance van for this one .
can i come with you ?
no .
please ?
no .
undercovers are in position .
agent davies is at the south entrance .
agent westley is ...
getting chad a beer .
what are you doing ?
chad told me to get him a drink .
i &apos;m undercover as his buddy .
did he also tell you to double fist it ?
no . he said that you need to loosen up ?
come on .
hi , there .
chad says you &apos;re an fbi agent .
he &apos;s scared of guns .
yeah .
okay , it &apos;s time to put the fear of god in him .
yeah .
hey , chad .
i &apos;m not sure how long our cover &apos;s gonna last , peter .
you need to make positive i.d. on our young thief
as soon as possible .
stay alert .
who knows what disguise he &apos;ll be wearing this time ?
i &apos;ll look for the crooked mustache .
hey , if you &apos;re hunting robin hoodie ,
does that make you the sheriff of nottingham ?
oh , i &apos;m not the sheriff of nottingham .
am i ?
chad says you &apos;re into body shots .
i am .
stay on target , caffrey .
but not tonight .
designated driver . sorry .
i got eyes on a potential scott .
why do you think it &apos;s him ?
he &apos;s wearing a suit hoodie .
i don &apos;t even know what that is .
all right , confirm it &apos;s him ,
then jones will move in for the arrest .
you are in so far over your head ,
and you have no idea , do you ?
you say something ?
no , i was just admiring this bike .
sure does look expensive .
120 grand .
damn .
have we met ? uh , i &apos;ve seen you somewhere .
stand by in case caffrey &apos;s been made .
everybody ready to move .
maybe chad &apos;s party last week ?
wasn &apos;t there .
oh , man , you missed out .
they had mermaids .
i mean , literally , girls wearing tails and nothing else .
and all he has for this party is a motorcycle ?
poor guy .
oh , come on , man .
it &apos;s a carbon fiber and titanium chassis ,
1966 cc engine .
top speed of 260 kilometers per hour ...
and not remotely street legal .
it &apos;s a work of art on two wheels .
hi . i &apos;m shannon .
hey .
excuse me .
it &apos;s him .
you &apos;re sure ?
beautiful girl just gave him her name ,
and he didn &apos;t give one back .
there &apos;s something suspicious about her .
the fact that she seemed more interested in him than you ?
not that .
not entirely that .
she just put something in his drink .
excuse me ! whoa ! what the hell ? !
sorry .
jones !
oh , my god !
fbi ! everybody down !
lock down the exits . nobody gets out .
you need to tell us everything .
we &apos;re gonna find who hired you eventually .
but if you help us now ,
we can make a deal .
what do we know about her ?
she &apos;s been a suspect in some heists and robberies .
attempted murder &apos;s a new one , though .
so i &apos;m guessing it wasn &apos;t splenda
that she sprinkled in scott &apos;s drink .
potassium cyanide .
he would have been dead in minutes .
i didn &apos;t buy the ring .
it &apos;s a little gothic for my taste ,
but i never refuse jewelry .
now , let me guess .
you didn &apos;t know there was poison inside .
oops .
how &apos;s she connected to him ?
this might have something to do with it .
found it in her purse .
one of the people scott robbed had a security camera .
he didn &apos;t see it .
that &apos;s another reason i don &apos;t like disguises .
too easy to get comfortable ?
it also explains how our girl found him .
so , i guess they took measures into their own hands .
yeah .
we &apos;ll run that photo through ,
see which item he stole while wearing this wig .
what do you think of him ?
he &apos;s a kid having the time of his life .
he &apos;s impulsive , arrogant ,
and has no idea how deeply in over his head he is .
okay , fine .
he bears a cursory resemblance to me .
think we can bring him back from the dark side ?
it &apos;s hard to do .
i wonder what would &apos;ve happened
if i &apos;d have caught you earlier .
it wouldn &apos;t have made a difference , peter .
the con is a rush .
it &apos;s an addiction .
and you need to hit rock bottom before you can change .
when did you hit bottom ?
i never said i did .
nice bustier . for you or christie ?
this is one of three items
robin hoodie stole while wearing that wig .
are we really gonna keep calling him that ?
sure . it &apos;s no &quot; james bonds . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not .
and these diamonds are from a heist
our lady killer was a suspect in .
so , scott thought he stole an expensive piece of jewelry .
instead , he stole evidence of a crime .
kill scott , and they eliminate any evidence
that leads back to them .
the office in this picture has an unobstructed view
of midtown from an upper floor .
let &apos;s see if we can figure out elevation and angles
to see where it is .
done .
look at you .
the office belongs to thomas carlisle .
he was suspected of masterminding the heist .
what an incredible coincidence .
i &apos;ve heard of mr. carlisle .
he has been a person of interest more than a few times .
let &apos;s go talk to him .
neal , see if you can get any leads on scott .
oh , you &apos;re gonna love this . the street is abuzz .
someone is looking for you .
no name . he &apos;s a kid .
word is he talks the talk , so to speak the speak .
did you enjoy that sentence ?
yes , i did .
so he &apos;s trying to find me .
makes your job easier .
i want you to get in touch with him .
i will . but first , we have a little identity crisis .
this is my associate --
you are about to be reborn .
names are not necessary .
mozzie says you can create permanent identities
without the baby birth certificates .
identity farming .
i &apos;ve heard of it , but only as a theory .
how &apos;d you pull that off ?
years ago , i began filing for a number of birth certificates .
back then , it was much easier .
the world was more trusting .
we live in cynical times , alec .
oh , yeah , this is true .
i treated these identities as if they were real .
as they grew up , i gave them bank accounts ,
library cards , tax returns .
you created paper trails .
i created lives ,
one of which you will now step into
as if you had lived it all along .
you will be victor .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m a victor .
yes , you are .
strong @-@ willed , so stubborn growing up .
and he &apos;s your age .
victor moreau .
did you plan this ?
no . destiny ?
goodbye , victor .
now you .
you are now bob .
i never liked you .
i like you , bob .
a japanese sculpture , an italian harp ,
and framed spanish doubloons .
can &apos;t really settle on a theme , can he ?
i think the point is that everything is really expensive .
no matter what it looks like .
agents !
i hope this isn &apos;t about that diamond heist a year ago ,
because you guys have hassled me plenty already ,
and you haven &apos;t found anything .
it isn &apos;t . this is a friendly visit .
great . let &apos;s have a drink .
what &apos;s your pleasure , um ...
fbi agents burke and berrigan .
and , no , thanks .
the 7x3000 reinforced titanium .
it &apos;s a beauty ... and brand @-@ new .
it is .
it &apos;s the most expensive model they got .
any reason you need a new safe ?
a man in my position ,
people try to steal from me all the time .
these attempts get reported ?
you know what i mean .
i do ?
yeah .
instead of working their way up like i did ,
they try to take shortcuts .
want to take what isn &apos;t theirs .
anyone stolen from you recently ?
if they had , they &apos;d regret it .
how &apos;s that ?
&apos;cause you guys would arrest them , of course .
of course . that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
do you recognize this kid ?
i don &apos;t . what did he do ?
he took a shortcut --
took some things that weren &apos;t his .
he &apos;s been robbing wealthy people in the area who collect ...
items of extravagance .
you certainly fit the bill .
one of your guys called .
they know where he &apos;s at .
i gotta go . is there anything else you need ?
call me if you see him or hear anything , will you ?
of course .
lovely guy .
he &apos;s a peach .
the kind of man who &apos;d be stupid enough
to put stolen diamonds on a bustier .
so , that really was neal caffrey at the party ?
in the infamous flesh .
i knew i recognized him .
so , you work for him ?
work with him .
kind of like a mentor .
he learned everything from me .
so , then , how come i &apos;ve never heard of you ?
exactly .
ah . ah , the man himself .
you &apos;re being followed .
look to the southwest .
your other southwest , moz .
you know , in my defense , i always carry a compass .
it &apos;s carlisle . you need to stall him .
you ever pull a scroge mcduck ?
w @-@ what &apos;s that ?
step one -- hack an atm .
how are you gonna get past the encrypted lockout ?
oh , i exploit an unpatched security flaw in their firmware ,
which gives me admin access .
nice .
then i put it into a test loop , and voila ?
what &apos;s step two ?
now you run .
hey , that atm &apos;s spitting out money !
hey , check it out !
holy crap , there &apos;s money everywhere !
slow down .
it &apos;s new york city .
once you get some distance , it &apos;s better to blend in .
sorry . i don &apos;t think clearly when people are trying to kill me .
never say you &apos;re sorry unless you &apos;re running a con .
whatever . is the fbi here ?
no .
but you should turn yourself in .
you &apos;re neal caffrey .
are you really telling me there isn &apos;t another way ?
get in here .
you brought a wanted fugitive into your home .
it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
not helping .
and peter doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s here .
what is she doing here ?
i was here to surprise neal with dinner .
surprise .
peter doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s here yet .
i &apos;m still deciding what i &apos;m gonna do with him .
he &apos;s one of our own , neal .
we have to help him . it &apos;s part of the code .
besides , i kind of like him .
he reminds me of a young ...
don &apos;t say it .
... me .
what do you think ?
why are you asking her ?
i think you should help him .
brilliant woman .
i think you should help him get out of trouble
and then convince him to turn himself in .
okay , that &apos;s absurd .
give him a chance to live a life ,
make his mark on the world .
this is your chance to show him there &apos;s another way .
well , i &apos;m not exactly a role model .
you &apos;re probably the closest thing he has .
i need your help .
i never stole from anybody who didn &apos;t deserve it .
never hurt anyone .
i figured you , of all people , would understand that .
all right , let &apos;s focus on the first part .
we need to figure out how to get carlisle off your back .
take a seat , kid .
so , you and neal are dating .
uh , it &apos;s complicated .
while scott &apos;s out there hitting on your lady friend ,
take a look at bob .
it &apos;s truly amazing work .
no one &apos;s ever gonna find us , neal .
we can be taking off to paradise
as soon as we get ahold of that list .
unless we get arrested for harboring a fugitive first .
or scott pins this on us
so he can live to steal another day .
oh , he isn &apos;t gonna do that .
i sense good in him .
do you , qui @-@ gon jinn ?
well , chaotic good , anyway .
neal , he &apos;s us .
this is peter .
hey , peter .
any word on the street where scott might be ?
no , the streets don &apos;t seem to know where he &apos;s disappeared to .
we need to catch him soon .
we catch scott ,
we might be able to bring carlisle down , as well .
i &apos;ll keep my ears open .
you got something more important you &apos;re working on ?
no . i &apos;m sorry , peter .
i &apos;m just distracted right now .
i &apos;m with sara .
at home ?
yeah .
neal .
yeah ?
i like the two of you together .
she &apos;s a good influence on you .
you think so ?
yeah .
don &apos;t be a bad influence on her .
i &apos;ll do my best .
figure out a plan yet ?
i &apos;m working on it .
listen ...
are you sure you want to be involved with this ?
whatever we end up doing , it probably won &apos;t be legal .
all right , what i do occasionally falls in the same gray area .
this won &apos;t be gray .
i have stretched more laws than i care to admit .
that &apos;s what i like about you .
yeah ?
i &apos;m usually returning things to their rightful owner , though .
what ?
that &apos;s it .
you &apos;re a genius .
guys , i got an idea .
show me the glass .
hey , we got your keister off the hook .
don &apos;t hold out on us now , kid .
are you still sure about him ?
not so much .
wow , it &apos;s , uh ... beautiful .
looks very comfortable .
you cracked carlisle &apos;s safe to get this , right ?
yeah .
can you do it again ?
safe has an electronic keypad .
my black box does everything .
including taking the art out of safe @-@ cracking .
the art was programming this thing ,
which i did myself .
we need to get you into carlisle &apos;s office
so you can put the bustier back .
then we could anonymously tip peter
that the diamonds could be found in carlisle &apos;s private safe .
peter moves in , arrests carlisle ,
who stole the diamonds in the first place .
it wouldn &apos;t even be planting evidence .
we &apos;d be returning it .
just like you never stole them at all .
i &apos;m not sure the suit will see it that way .
no . we should not let peter know about this .
the problem is , they &apos;ll
have an eye out for anyone who looks like me .
how big is that gray area you were talking about ?
you still checking neal &apos;s anklet ?
he &apos;s at home . been there a while .
why don &apos;t you drop by ?
because he &apos;s up to something .
something to do with scott ?
i think so . i &apos;m gonna let it play out .
you think he &apos;ll lead you to him .
i have a feeling he &apos;s working on some kind of plan .
maybe more than one .
couple weeks ago , a degas popped up on the black market .
on the list ?
not sure . it was pulled after a couple of hours .
no details beyond the artist .
but how many new degases are there ?
showed up the same time d.c. art crimes came to visit .
probably coincidence .
probably .
i &apos;m gonna move this -- to be safe .
all right , we need to get into carlisle &apos;s office ,
hack the safe , and return the bustier .
mozzie , you will keep an eye on carlisle .
i &apos;ll keep all four on him .
now , it &apos;s the weekend ,
so the only people in the building will be security .
security will be increased in carlisle &apos;s penthouse .
luckily , not on the lower floors .
the telephone @-@ junction box is on the second floor .
and that is where we need to get scott .
do i have to be the baby ?
mm @-@ hmm . standard rule -- the new man on the team is the baby .
the alarm system won &apos;t be --
it &apos;s state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , but give me a couple hours .
i can write an algorithm that can bypass the signal traps .
the alarm system won &apos;t be a problem .
how &apos;s that ?
because we &apos;re not gonna set it off .
our obstacles are a guard and a security door
that only opens from the inside .
all the while , you just have to avoid the cameras .
to get through the security door ,
we &apos;ll need mozzie &apos;s air gun .
oh , be warned -- like an olsen twin ,
though she seems demure , she packs quite a punch .
hey , you can &apos;t have that open indoors .
oh , i know . it &apos;s bad luck . i &apos;ve been trying to close it .
the catch is stuck .
out .
i &apos;m supposed to meet a friend here .
i don &apos;t care . meet him on the street .
uh , did you hear something earlier ?
i did . yeah . thunder .
once scott &apos;s through the security door ,
it &apos;s sara &apos;s turn .
really ? a barbie ?
standard rule .
there are no standard rules .
i would much prefer to be the salt shaker .
uh , considering your role in this ,
the barbie is more apropos .
excuse me . i &apos;m here for mr. carlisle .
i &apos;m afraid he &apos;s not in .
oh , i don &apos;t think you understand .
i &apos;m here for mr. carlisle .
i &apos;ll have to call his office .
mm . do that .
scott should have hacked into the switchboard by then .
so , scott -- hello .
oh . come on . stay with me .
you &apos;ll be carlisle &apos;s assistant .
carlisle &apos;s office .
is mr. carlisle in ? there &apos;s a woman here who --
about time ! he &apos;s been waiting for her .
send her up immediately .
how &apos;s she look ?
expensive .
scott , you &apos;ll put the security cameras
in carlisle &apos;s office on a loop ,
especially the one you missed the first time .
once sara &apos;s up there , she &apos;ll let you in .
eyes front and center , romeo .
yes , ma &apos;am .
don &apos;t call me &quot; ma &apos;am . &quot;
then , scott hacks the safe &apos;s keypad again ,
puts the bustier back , and we &apos;re home free .
this is not the same safe .
you can &apos;t crack this ?
old school &apos;s not really my style .
okay , and mine is not cracking a safe in my bra ,
but we adapt .
out for a stroll ? taking in the sights ?
peter --
imagine my surprise when i checked your anklet
and found out that you were right outside carlisle &apos;s office .
i can explain .
starting with robin hoodie .
is he in there ?
i think it &apos;s better if i don &apos;t answer that .
better for you or for me ?
for scott .
look , i &apos;ve got a plan , okay ?
and part of that plan is contingent
on you not knowing what it is .
i &apos;m not the sheriff of nottingham .
did i miss a conversation ?
i &apos;m not the bad guy .
but scott can &apos;t be allowed to run around like this .
he &apos;s gonna get somebody hurt , starting with himself .
i need to bring him in .
i know . give me an hour .
after that , i think i can get him to turn himself in to you .
you think ?
i know .
look , i have to go .
i &apos;ll be waiting right here .
when you come back , you better have him with you .
thank you .
running out of umbrellas . what &apos;s wrong ?
carlisle updated the safe .
is he serious ?
apparently .
i increased the sensitivity of the mike on the phone 10 times .
you made a stethoscope happen .
i &apos;m hitting the cylinders . it &apos;s not working .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s a six @-@ cylinder safe with two false gates .
false gates ?
yeah , safe @-@ cracking booby traps .
you hit one , you have to start all over again .
may i ?
of course .
all right , i &apos;ll go by touch .
you go by sound .
you two make quite the pair .
hello ?
are you done yet ?
uh , we hit a snag , but we &apos;re gonna be out soon .
or not so soon .
yeah , well , unsnag as quickly as possible .
okay . thank you , mozzie .
what is it ?
carlisle is on his way here .
all right , come on .
thanks , jones . i appreciate the backup .
no need to rush here .
i &apos;m not expecting any ...
... trouble .
on second thought , go ahead and rush .
all right , that &apos;s the third gate .
all right , carlisle &apos;s got to have a security monitor
around here somewhere .
that &apos;s a gate .
good ear .
are you saying you didn &apos;t feel it ?
i &apos;m saying nice ear .
he is downstairs .
still two gates to go .
we don &apos;t have time .
wait . peter &apos;s there .
he &apos;s flashing his badge at carlisle .
the fed &apos;s buying us time ? why ?
because he &apos;s peter .
i have a few follow @-@ up questions
from our meeting the other day .
can it wait ?
no . it can &apos;t .
of course . come , we &apos;ll go into my office .
down here is fine .
but the whiskey &apos;s upstairs . i insist .
and i insist right here is fine .
agent burke , right ?
right .
unless i &apos;m under arrest ,
i &apos;ll answer your questions in my office .
after you .
stop .
all right , that &apos;s it .
that should be the last gate .
all right . elevator coming up !
we only have time to try once .
it &apos;s your go , kid .
now , what is it you wanted to discuss ?
i wanted to talk to you about that diamond heist .
thought this was about some kid
running around robbing people .
it was .
but it got me to thinking what could possibly be
in this monster safe of yours .
i guess you &apos;ll never know .
you &apos;re right .
because it &apos;s uncrackable , right ?
completely .
you must have left it open by accident , then .
that &apos;s impossible .
those look like the diamonds i was talking about .
you &apos;re under arrest , mr. carlisle .
those -- those aren &apos;t mine .
oh , you &apos;re alleging that a thief broke into your office
to crack an uncrackable safe
to give you millions of dollars in diamonds ?
hands in the air .
all right .
all right . okay .
i wouldn &apos;t do that if i were you .
sorry i &apos;m late .
damn , that &apos;s a hell of a view .
oh . you &apos;re gonna miss this one .
i would like to go put on something a little less breezy .
yes . go talk to him .
thank you .
so , what are you gonna do now ?
oh , come on .
you didn &apos;t really think i was gonna turn myself in , did you ?
i was hoping you would .
would you have when you were my age ?
no , i wouldn &apos;t have .
but this isn &apos;t about me .
its about peter burke .
he &apos;s the smartest man i &apos;ve ever known .
he caught me , and he will catch you .
only question is when .
nobody &apos;s that good .
he is , scott .
if you turn yourself in now , he &apos;ll make you a deal .
it &apos;s the best deal you &apos;re ever gonna get .
you know what ? keep running .
always looking over your shoulder ,
never slowing down long enough to share your life with anyone .
because you know that the second you do ,
that is when he will catch you .
let me help you , scott .
where &apos;s scott ?
any sign of scott ?
nothing . he &apos;s gone completely to ground .
i screwed up .
yes , you did .
but ... you helped get carlisle off the streets .
that &apos;s a good win .
i actually thought i was getting through to him .
disappointing , isn &apos;t it ?
you think they &apos;re listening ,
and then they go off and do the opposite of what you say .
now he could be anywhere .
he really could .
but he &apos;s not .
he said he &apos;d only turn himself in to you .
so ...
this is the guy who caught you ?
believe it or not , yeah .
glad you &apos;re here .
you still have the pieces you stole ?
depends . which pieces do you know about ?
the more you cooperate , the better deal i can get you .
you &apos;re gonna have to serve some time .
i know .
can i , um ...
yeah .
so , what made you decide to come in ?
because stealing stupid things from rich people
was already getting boring .
or because what you said got to me .
whichever makes you feel better .
thanks for the help .
anytime .
jones , could you cuff him again ?
real cute .
let &apos;s try it again .
give him some time .
people don &apos;t change overnight .
believe me , i know .
i work with living proof of it .
but they do change .
you &apos;re not the sheriff of nottingham .
i know .
i &apos;m thinking more king richard the lionheart .
i &apos;ll go with that .
good .
victor moreau .
vic .
vic moreau .
moreau . victor moreau .
nice to meet you .
just a second .
surprised ?
happily .
it looks like i caught you mid @-@ something .
i was just about to take a shower .
is that a statement or an invitation ?
yes . yes .
