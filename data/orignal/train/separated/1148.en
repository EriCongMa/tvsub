Wait, that's not Ian.
Wren?
What is he giving her?
..."If you continue as a rosewood's MVP,
We can offer you a full scholarship."
This means you don't have to move!
Em, did you write this letter?
I found this on the doormat.
They want you on their team.
舍不得你走 艾米小老鼠 -A
Honey, it's fantastic! Congratulations!
Who's that?
Danielle.
Well, does she know you're crushing on her?
Who's Lucas?
Oh, my friend over there.
I'm starting a new job.
Who's it for?
Jason Dilaurentis.
You can't work for him.
I need cash to buy tools and a truck.
I didn't leave without saying goodbye,
so I wrote you a letter.
I'll never be able to forget that you were using me.
I'm sorry.
We just got off the phone with your therapist.
She's recommending that you spend some time apart.
You're telling me that I can't see my friends?
What's going on? What are you doing?
I'm looking for my ring. Would you mind getting up?
I'll be back for it on Monday.
As soon as the banks open, I'll have the cash.
Spencer!
Take it. It's yours.
Are you crazy?
I'm back.
Huh. I'm surprised.
Um, here's my receipt for the ring.
Oh! Sorry.
This place is skeevy.
She pawned her sister's wedding ring.
You're not gonna go to Tiffany's.
So... Wren and Melissa?
Weird, right?
Could you tell what he gave her?
No. She didn't seem happy about it.
I wonder if Ian will be.
How you holdin' up?
Great. Ever since I got that fake scholarship letter,
My mom thinks I can do no wrong.
I'm living a lie I didn't even tell.
Leave it to "A" to make you feel bad
about your mom feeling good.
Here you go.
Horseshoe?
Is this some kind of a joke? I-I brought in a ring.
Not according to the ticket.
You gave me that ticket 48 hours ago.
Lot of people come through here in that time.
I need that ring back today,
so I need you to get back down there behind that counter and find it.
Or what?
You... want to call the police,
Talk to them about it?
Be my guest.
I can't believe that it's gone.
At least you got your money back.
Am I supposed to give her this?
I stole it-- I actually stole my sister's wedding ring!
"Just my luck-- diamonds are a girl's best friend. 'A.'"
所以放老实点
Coffee is made, newspaper is in,
and your father is putting breakfast on the table.
Double-berry pancakes.
Wow! We-- we haven't had those since...
I know. I miss them.
It sort of feels like everything's finally
getting back to normal around here.
I like that.
So do I.
Mike, breakfast.
I'll grab something later.
Mike, on the other hand,
may not be on the same page about me being back.
No, he's fine.
Why shouldn't he be?
At least he has a social life.
I know this not being able to see your friends
is probably really tough.
Yeah, that's an understatement.
You do know that we're only doing this
because we feel it's best for you,
For all of you.
Now...
What?
How do I look?
Nice.
Nicer than usual. Why?
Because today is my first day...
Of being a full-time teacher! Right!
Sorry. I've just been kind of...
So, do they--
do they know what class you're gonna teach?
I'm taking over Mr. Fitz's class.
Try and contain your enthusiasm.
No. I-it's not that.
I'm happy for you.
It'll be great.
Going somewhere?
No.
Why do you have your passport?
It's-- it's not mine. It's Ian's.
I need it for the insurance claim on my ring.
It still hasn't turned up?
It will.
I'd rather find my husband.
I'll be home after school,
Seeing as I can't hang out with any of my friends.
About that--
I was talking with Spencer's mom yesterday.
And you realized that this whole bestie-ban was a terrible idea,
and I can hang out with them?
No, we realized that you're the only one
who hasn't been to a solo session with your therapist yet.
So?
So, your father and I think you should.
Your friends have all taken it seriously.
I think it would be a good idea if you did too.
Can't we just watch intervention and say that I went?
Stop. You're going. After school today.
My week's really shaping up.
I have a surprise for you.
What's that?
Well... Take a look.
Who sent these?
Well, I would imagine it's
the scout you spoke to over at Danby. Who else?
Yeah. You're right.
Somebody must really want you over at that school, huh?
Can I have some of those?
Have them all. I may never eat again.
Ugh. The rat fall in the fry oil again? 'Cause last time...
It's not the food. It's... Danielle.
Yearbook Danielle? What's wrong?
What's right?
Ever since you helped me score a date with her,
my stomach has been like a rat fell in fry oil.
I'm completely off my game.
Lucas, you don't have game.
Whatever. I'm calling this date off.
No! No!
You cannot do that!
Sure I can. I'll be doing both of us a favor.
I wouldn't have done this if
I didn't think you two would have fun together.
And fun is good, right?
Like, you enjoy fun, right?
Yeah, sure.
I mean...
Come with us on the date.
I hear it's gonna be a lot of fun.
And weird. Haven't you ever heard the phrase "Three's a crowd"?
Fine. Don't come alone. You can bring Caleb.
No. No, I'm sorry. Absolutely not. That's not happening.
Come on, it's just one night.
You got me into this mess,
and now you're gonna have to help me deal with it.
I'm going this afternoon, right after school.
Are you sure that's safe?
No.
Aria.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
We were-- we were just saying goodbye.
Yeah, that's not what I want to talk to you about.
Oh. Okay. Um...
Well, I would say you had really good mastery of the material,
excellent eye contact with the students,
but your handwriting could use some improvement, though.
Yeah, that's not it either, but thanks.
Um, Mike left his keys at home today,
And I've got a faculty meeting after school.
Can you take these
by his pickup game at the park after school?
Yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Um... And now that you mention it,
The whole "Not seeing your friends" thing
should probably extend to the school hallways, as well.
That date is gonna be a disaster.
Well, you're his "bro-mate." Help him out.
I tried, but he gets nauseous just talking about it.
And I'm on the bottom bunk.
He has bunk beds?
Oh, and toys, in little boxes.
Okay, they're collectibles.
You know he wants us to go with them.
I know. It's pretty lame, huh?
Yeah.
Should we?
No.
Unless...
Seriously?
The kid's gonna swallow his own tongue if we don't do something.
No, seriously, you're gonna go out with me?
I'm not going out with you.
I'm accompanying Lucas and Danielle,
And you happen to be doing the same thing.
We'll be his wingmen, or wing people,
but that's it, you got it?
Got it.
Good.
Radiology, dial the operator.
Radiology, dial the operator.
Spencer, what are you doing here?
We need to talk. I'm sorry, this is kind of important.
Could you...
Like, not be here right now?
What did you give to Melissa outside of our house,
and what did she tell you?
It's complicated.
Okay, well, let me make it a bit easier for you.
Ian tried to kill me.
What? Are you okay?
For now.
But how about you tell me what you know
before he tries again?
She wanted meds. Supplies.
And you were just happy to hand them over?
Ian might be hiding out next door to my house.
No, Melissa said he'd only
tell her where he was once she had the drugs,
but that it was somewhere outside of Rosewood.
Why did you help her?
Honestly?
'cause I feel partly responsible
for Melissa charging back to Ian.
How could I not help?
I didn't give her everything that she asked for,
some of the painkillers she wanted.
I'd lose my job if I did that.
Spencer, please, you have to believe me.
I had no idea that you were a part of this.
I don't want to see you get hurt again.
It's kind of too late for that.
You need to leave this alone.
I can't leave this alone.
And I need your help.
Every time I gamble with you and your sister,
people end up getting hurt.
I won't let that happen again.
Wren, will you help me find Ian or not?
I'm sorry. No.
It's amazing how slowly time passes
when you keep looking at a clock, isn't it?
Totally.
Did you speak with your friends
about what it would be like coming in here on your own?
We're not supposed to talk, remember?
My guess is you find your ways.
You're best friends.
Your opinions, your interactions,
all are important to one another.
So why keep us apart?
Perspective.
Sometimes when you're given an opportunity
to look at something from a different vantage point,
you see different things.
What's the point of seeing things differently
if you can't share with your friends?
Hanna, I can help you.
Help me what?
Let go.
I've talked with a lot of young people about loss.
Sometimes it's feelings of guilt that's holding them back,
sometimes it's anger or fear,
sometimes all three.
That'd be really crazy, huh?
No, not at all.
It's quite common.
Alison is still here for you...
for all of you, isn't she?
You don't know the half of it.
Maybe not.
But whatever you're feeling, you can move past it.
You make it sound like it's up to me.
You... and Alison.
I think you need to have a conversation with her.
It's a little late for that.
Maybe not.
Pretend Alison is sitting here, right now.
I thought talking to empty chairs
was the kind of thing people come here to stop doing.
Humor me.
What would you say to Alison if you could?
I'd say time's up.
Mike, it's me.
Still wondering where you are, okay?
Um, I'm at the park.
I'm trying to give you your keys, so pick up.
Mike!
Hey, Mike!
Oh. Sorry.
Lewis. Hey.
Do you know where I can find Mike?
Got me.
He usually plays here, though, right?
Not for the last couple of months, no.
No. No, no, no.
He usually plays pickup here.
Almost every day after school.
So do we, and I haven't seen him. Sorry.
Hey.
Hey.
You haven't seen my brother, have you?
Uh, no. Sorry.
What, he give you the slip?
Something like that.
I was always lying about where I was when I was his age.
I don't remember a lot about that time, actually.
Most of what I do remember, I wish I could forget, you know?
You know what I do remember? Your pink hair.
Really?
I thought it was cool.
Really?!
Really.
I mean, you-- you always did the unexpected,
As opposed to me.
Which... I also thought was cool.
Well, uh...
Hey...
I miss that pink hair.
Emily.
I saw the whole meet. You're so good.
Thanks.
And I'm even more impressed by that
Commitment Letter you got from Danby.
How'd you hear about that?
From your mom, just like everybody else at the pool.
She is totally stoked, and so am I.
I mean, Danby is a beautiful campus,
and I could come visit, and...
What's wrong?
Oh, my god, you don't want to go to Danby?
Or you don't want me to come to Danby?
No, it's not that.
That letter is not real.
The coach from Danby didn't write it.
I... I did.
Wow, so you just mailed it to yourself?
Yeah. Something like that.
Emily.
Great job, honey! Fantastic!
Congratulations.
The field was kind of weak.
No, they were good, but you were better.
Uh, mom, this is Samara.
Hi, samara. Pam Fields.
Emily has told me so much about you,
and it's nice to finally meet.
Likewise.
You know, I sent video of your winning leg of the relay to your dad,
and he was so excited.
You must be overjoyed.
Why don't we have a celebration tonight?
Mom...
I know inviting your other friends
probably isn't such a good idea right now.
Right, so I don't--
Samara, would you like to come?
I'd love to.
Seven o'clock? Okay, great.
I'll see you then.
Relax.
If I'm there and the truth slips out,
your mom won't get so angry.
"We'll be late. Take care of your sister..."
Exclamation point. "Mom."
That sounds like a fun evening.
Melissa?
You home?
Spencer?
Spencer?
Okay, so, if Ian's not next door, where is he?
And where's he going?
And why is Melissa going with him?
Right?
Things don't usually work out well for the wives of murderers.
Do you... Do you think that he'd hurt her?
I don't know.
I wish I could just come stay over at your house.
Me too.
I'm home alone with the doors locked,
and I'm creeped out.
I gotta go. My parents are here.
Okay.
Mom?
Dad?
Boo.
Hey.
Hey!
What?
Where were you all day?
What's it to you?
Well, I... I was trying to find you all day to give you your keys.
So, give them to me.
No.
Let's forget about today.
Where have you been every other day, huh?
Because the guys you play ball with hardly remember what you look like.
Places. Here and there.
But... But that's what you plan on telling mom and dad?
You know that they're gonna find out.
Not from you, they're not,
'cause if you tell them,
I'll tell them about you and your friends sneaking around town
While you're supposed to be having a time out.
Why are you doing this?
Mom's moved in. Things are going back to normal.
You think that's all it takes?
The four of us eat pancakes together,
And everything's okay?
Things aren't how they used to be.
They never will be.
Hey.
refill?
Thanks.
You two doing okay?
Great.
Mm-hm. Fine.
Okay, well, we have to leave for the movie in 10 minutes.
note to self:
It's a little too early to be channeling my inner mom.
It's a little late for that, anyway.
What are you talking about? She's totally into him.
Whatever you say.
Maybe they have different mating rituals in yearbook club.
What are you, the expert now?
I can read you pretty well.
Well, trust me, it's going great.
This blows.
What? I'm having a good time.
Are you?
I would be. I like you,
But...
Tell me you haven't noticed how she keeps checking you out.
Hanna?
Uh, I don't think so.
She comes over here, like, every 20 seconds.
She's totally still into you.
Well, then, why would she bring caleb?
To make you jealous.
Aren't you?
No.
I would be.
That was my fifth birthday party, my first dive.
Oh, look how cute you are.
Oh, that was so long ago.
That was the best birthday ever.
I can't believe I wore my hair like that.
Hi.
Hi.
Did you make this scrapbook?
I did. One of many.
Did you use a glue gun to stick the rice paper to the binding?
What else?
You know, that's the first thing I remember asking for for Christmas.
I think I stuck myself to everyroom in the house
I still use it for some of my jewelry projects.
Really?
Yeah, my mom and I,
we made some scrapbooks like this when I was a kid,
but they never turned out this well.
You know, I was thinking about making a new one,
Sort of along the lines of a Rosewood-to-Danby theme.
That's a great idea.
You know, em, you and I should probably take a tour of Danby,
Just get the lay of the land.
Yeah, there's plenty of time for that.
Honey, it's never too soon to start doing a little bit of research.
Actually, what I should do is call your scout
and talk to him.
Mom.
Honey, I've got to call and thank him for the gifts, anyway.
The truth is...
The truth is, Danby has a good team,
but so do a lot of other places.
My dad knows the coach at Stanford,
and they have a great team.
I was just telling Emily that I think
a lot of different schools will be interested in her.
You think so?
With her times? Totally.
I wouldn't get locked into danby.
Play it cool, and wait for the other offers
to roll in during senior year.
That's when the real action starts.
If you contact the coach now,
Other places might get the wrong idea.
Well, that seems to make a reasonable amount of sense.
Em?
Um... Yeah. For sure.
You gotta help me, guys.
I'm circling the drain here.
I feel your pain.
What are you talking about?
Danielle still thinks that you're crushing on me.
What?! No, I told her I was over you,
and, just to be clear...
Okay, I get it, I get it.
But she doesn't.
Do you know what it's gonna be like in yearbook tomorrow?
They're gonna dedicate a special page
to how stupid I was to think that I could
go out with someone like her,
and I'll have to design it.
I guess I was just kidding myself,
thinking that I could let go of who everyone else thinks I am,
and just be myself.
Well, thanks for trying to achieve the unachievable.
You know what's a drag?
Is how much better Lucas would be
if he didn't care what everybody else thought.
I know, right?
What are we gonna do to help him?
Put your arm around me.
What?
Just put your arm around me.
Nice work.
It was easy.
Well, I'm not.
Melissa, I've had second thoughts
about the injuries you've described.
I'm concerned Ian could have a staph infection.
I'm gonna have to insist that I see him before you go anywhere.
I'll bring whatever drugs are necessary.
No, Melissa.
I come with you, or no deal.
She bought it.
She still doesn't know where Ian's hiding,
but she'll call me tomorrow when she finds out.
So I can go with her.
And I'll be right behind you.
Please don't make me tell Danielle that you're a peeping tom.
I won't.
I just wanted to come over and say thank you
for what you did last night.
You know, you've come a long way from being one of Alison's posse.
Whatever.
No, seriously.
What you did, you did for me,
and there wasn't anything in it for you.
That means a lot.
Hanna! Your appointment isn't until next week.
I know, but...
I need to talk.
Hey, need a ride?
Used to be fun when I took you to school.
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.
We're here for you, your mom and I.
You know that, right?
Yeah, I do.
Okay.
And I'm glad that the things that used to be fun
are becoming fun again.
Me too.
Hey, Mike.
How was the game yesterday?
Great, like always.
Aria watched for a couple of minutes.
Yeah?
Want a ride to school?
I'm cool.
Sure, I mean we could stop and get a...
a cup of coffee.
Is he okay?
Yeah, I think so.
All right. We'll leave in five.
Okay.
What you said yesterday about seeing things differently--
Um, I-I went on a date.
A-a double date.
Actually, it wasn't even really...
Hanna. Breathe.
You were right.
Alison is still with us. With me.
More than I want.
Why more?
Our friendship was work,
like-- like you had to impress her
to make her like you, and...
that meant doing things
that maybe you didn't feel so good about doing.
Sometimes bad things.
If it was so hard, why was it so important to be her friend?
She could make you feel special,
and that seemed worth it then.
And now?
What would you like to say to Alison?
Just that...
To Alison.
Alison...
You were the best friend I ever had,
and that meant a lot to me.
You meant a lot to me.
But you were also the worst enemy I ever had,
and I can't believe it took me this long to realize that.
How do you think Alison would respond to that?
Well, look at you.
All independent and in touch with your feelings.
I'll bet you're pretty impressed with yourself right now,
aren't you?
Yeah.
I'm proud of you, Hanna.
I don't care.
Of course you don't.
Today...
You've got doctor do-over there ready to
pat you on the back
for talking to an empty chair.
I don't need her either.
Well, you need someone.
Low self-esteem leads to "Hefty Hanna."
Wasn't that covered wellness class?
I have other friends.
Real friends.
You have what I gave you.
You think your three gal-pals
will be with you forever, don't you?
News flash: You're already losing them.
They're gonna move on, Hanna, and you're not.
And you know who you'll be left with?
Me.
I'll always be with you.
I'm the only one that can make you happy,
the only one that'll tell you the truth.
I'm the only one that you can count on.
Then I'd rather be alone.
You won't last a week.
At least I'll be alive.
You can't reach into my life anymore,
not unless I let you.
You're gone,
and I am so over missing you.
Hey, you?
Have you transferred here without telling me?
I thought about it.
No, I called you this morning,
but I got your voicemail.
I wanted to see how you were doing
after last night's near-miss.
Okay, though I feel like I just postponed the inevitable.
Maybe not.
I mean, what I said last night was the truth,
except for the part about my dad knowing the coach from Stanford.
But it was good advice.
And she was online this morning,
checking every college with an endowment and a pool.
So it worked.
For now.
So, be happy.
For now.
With me.
'least it gives us time for a second date.
Wren.
Melissa just called. She knows where Ian is.
I'm on the way.
Spencer--!
Mom?
We need to talk.
Can it wait, because Spencer--
I don't think it can.
I just got a call from Dr. Sullivan.
Her office was broken into
after your last session.
It was completely trashed.
Why would she call you?
Hanna, what did you and Dr. Sullivan talk about?
Isn't that supposed to be between me and her?
I mean, that's how it works, right?
Was it something that somebody...
might not want other people to know?
We can't do this right now.
Yes, you can. If Dr. Sullivan calls the police,
they're gonna be asking a lot more questions than I am.
Well, then, I'm gonna need answers,
and I'm not getting them here!
Hanna!
Excuse me, ma'am.
Who else had keys to the office?
No one. Why?
There aren't any signs of forced entry.
Do we have a plan?
Working on it.
Should we call Garrett,
tell him about Ian?
No.
The last thing we need to do is get him involved
in another mystery we can't explain.
That's what happens
when we're the girls who cried wolf.
I mean, don't you get it?
We're screwed.
They're stopping.
There's no turning back now, right?
I've got 9-1-1 on speed-dial.
I've only got one bar.
Oh, crap. No bars.
We should take a photo of Ian,
prove we haven't been making this all up.
Yeah, well, you go ahead and do that
while I try not to get killed.
Sorry. I'm just worried about Melissa.
Who knows what Ian's thinking?
Or if he has a gun.
He's the bad guy, right?
Melissa!
