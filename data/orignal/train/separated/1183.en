Did "A" send this to you?
No, I took it out of Paige's bag.
Why would Paige have it?
She may be "A," Aria.
Are you Emily Fields?
Yes.
I'm Maya's cousin Nate.
You must be Amy.
Are you maggie?
I am.
I like this age. It's so sweet.
Malcolm also happens to be my son.
I'm not gonna ask you to explain anything,
because you won't...I'll find it out myself
I think we need to keep things on a friendship level.
What about the other night?
It doesn't change things.
I am going to help you stop "A."
And I'm not asking for your permission.
You and Paige have been
seeing each other on and off for almost a year,
and she's never mentioned anything about Ali to you?
Are you finished? Because I am.
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
So, the deceased was a friend of yours?
Miss Fields, please. I'm trying to understand what happened here.
Did you know the victim?
Yes.
The deceased was a friend of yours?
Jury selection is expected to conclude today,
and defense attorney Veronica Hastings
made a statement to reporters this morning.
My client is emotionally exhausted.
But he's relieved to know
that he's finally going to have the opportunity
To clear his name.
I mean, it's like all eyes are on rosewood.
Can't help but think that Toby
took that job in bucks county just to avoid all this.
She's taking the long way
because reporters are hounding her for interviews.
Okay, how are we gonna do this?
Well,Emily think she's coming over here so we can apologize.
But when she realizes what this is,
she'll probably be more mad at us than she was before.
I am not looking forward to seeing that.
In a successful intervention,
the loved one feels safe, not judged.
Great. Right,
so we'll start out all warm and fuzzy,
and then we just have to hit her with the truth.
Yeah. And that's your cue.
Okay, so...Paige was jealous of Ali,
we know that Paige was jealous of Maya,
and she was with Emily that night,
it was easy for her to set us up.
Right. And she has the other earring.
So she must have Ali's body, right?
Yeah.
Wait. I don't get it.
If Paige was so into Emily,
why would she drug her?
And then why would she drug herself?
Wait! Hanna,
I thought we were all on the same "A" page here.
We are. This is a practice run.
Right, okay.
Uh, drugging yourself is the best alibi ever.
Classic Sharon Stone move.
Remember that movie, Basic Instinct?
No.
No.
She wrote a murder mystery novel
to cover up a crime that she was about to commit.
It was actually kind of genius.
Look, remember, I'm Emily here.
We still think that "A" is working with Mona.
So what is your connection?
Two people who hated Ali.
Maybe one of them killed her
and the other one covered their tracks.
Or are still covering their tracks
by stealing the body and then pinning it on us.
Yeah. And the ultimate prize is
Paige gets Emily all to herself.
Hey, Em.
Hey. You want some coffee?
Em, you know how much we love you, right?
We love you enough to tell you the truth,
even when it hurts.
This doesn't sound like an apology.
I had to get you here, Emily.
I'm sorry for lying.
What is this?
It's the three people who love you the most in the world
trying to get you to see who Paige really is.
I can't believe it.
The trial's started,
and this how you guys show up for me.
We support you, Emily. We do.
But we're pretty sure that Garrett did not kill Maya.
And you think Paige did?
Are you out of your friggin' minds?
When did it become so easy for you
lie to your friends?
Emily, wait.
We found that at the trunk show.
In Paige's pack.
It's the other earring Aria put in Ali's casket.
We found a lot of other things exactly where "A" has put them.
Three against one. "A" wins.
That was exactly what Paige wanted.
Great. So now what?
Em wasn't in first period.
I think she ditched school today.
Does three messages and six texts make me a stalker?
This is the part where you're supposed to reassure me
that I'm just being a caring friend
and Emily's going to be fine.
She was totally right in calling me out for lying this morning.
So if anybody needs an intervention, it's me.
What's going on?
I haven't told you guys yet because Ezra doesn't even know.
Well, whatever it is, we're here for you. You'll be okay.
Wes let it slip that Ezra
got a girl pregnant before he left for college.
Their mom paid her to take care of it,
but she didn't take care of it, she had the baby.
It's a little boy.
Ezra has a kid?
Yeah, and I'm not done.
Wait, there's more?
I found the baby's mom... But I didn't tell Ezra.
So Ezra has no idea?
He thinks she had an abortion.
Aria, you have to tell him the truth.
Well, for whatever reason, she doesn't want him to know.
And I pushed him to call her.
When they talked, she didn't say anything about it.
If he finds out that you knew and you didn't tell him...
I just really feel like I'm
about to rattle the cage of a sleeping giant.
Do you remember what Ali said about secrets keeping us close?
She was wrong.
They tear us apart.
If you've got something to say, just say it.
Emily called me this morning in tears.
What the hell is wrong with you guys?
What do you want, Paige?
I want you to leave Emily alone.
She's got a lot going on right now,
she doesn't need you guys making it worse for her.
If you think I'm gonna let you hurt her,
you are underestimating me.
If you don't back down,
you're the one who's gonna get hurt, Spencer.
I won't let you come between us.
I know who you are.
They think they know you, but they're wrong.
Do they just not want you to be happy?
They don't trust anybody. It's because of "A."
You mean Mona.
If I tell you something,
promise me it doesn't leave this room.
Emily, you can trust me with your life.
If you tell anyone, it won't be safe.
There's nothing I wouldn't do to protect you.
It's not me I'm worried about. It's you.
Em, what is it?
We think there's somebody else helping Mona.
Have you told the police?
That night I came over,
the night Ali's body was taken, "A" Set us up.
They had a photo of us at her grave,
and we look guilty as hell.
So your friends think it's me?
That I'm this new "A"?
That's what you were arguing about this morning.
They'll figure it out. They'll realize they're wrong.
And in the meantime they'll
do everything they can to keep me away from you.
I won't let that happen.
I have some family stuff to take care of.
But I'll see you Monday.
And I'll go to the trial every day.
I promise I won't leave your side.
It's voice mail again.
She has to be home.
Maybe we should just go over there.
So things just went from worse to worser.
That's not a word. But continue.
Paige wasn't in Spanish today. Yo hablo sicko.
What?
She went home sick.
Or is she at Emily's?
I don't know about you two,
but I'm really willing to take this to the cops.
No! I'm already on their radar.
For all I know, Paige smeared my blood all over that anklet.
Well, Emily might be with Paige right now,
and we all know what she's capable of.
I think we should call her parents.
We'll tell them everything, together.
Spencer's right. There's strength in numbers.
All right.
Stand down, bitches.
Play it my way and Emily stays safe. "A."
If we don't hear from them the next hour,
I think we should revisit the idea of telling her parents.
I agree.
This is probably Paige just killing time
so she can just find a way to weasel herself out of this.
Hanna.
I'm just thinking about Emily.
She finally gets over Maya,
and now she's stuck with some twisted psycho bitch.
It's just another monster that Alison created.
She's been gone two years, and we're still caught in her web.
It's from "A."
"Let's settle this.
Alison's grave. Ten p.M. Bring Maya's bag."
There's an attachment.
It's another picture from that night.
Paige can brings us down and leave Emily completely in the clear.
This must have been her plan all along.
Get rid of us, and then she can have Emily all to herself.
But she hasn't sent these to the cops for a reason,
and it's probably because
there's something in Maya's bag that she needs.
Something that proves that she killed her.
No, we searched every inch of that bag.
You guys...
Another picture.
"Tell Emily and I'll leave you holding the bag."
Is that Ali?
Oh, my God.
What was that?
What was that?
Do you think your mom's home early?
Mom?
There's somebody downstairs.
Was it Paige?
What are you doing here?! I almost killed you!
With a pink, furry lamp, Hanna?
No. Caleb, seriously, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be watching Emily's house.
But there are, like, a dozen reporters camped out on her lawn,
her mom is home-- she's safe.
We heard from Paige and Mona.
You guys aren't showing up there alone.
Hello.
Hi, Em, it's me.
Please don't hang up.
I want to make sure you're okay.
Spencer and I are in town,
and there are reporters everywhere.
So are you okay?
Nate's going out of town this weekend.
I'm going with him.
That's great. Where are you going?
The Lighthouse Rock Inn. He found it online.
Look, I know it doesn't seem like it,
but we are here for you, Em.
You're right.
It doesn't seem like it.
They're three-deep on the lawn out there.
Yeah, I just got off the phone with Hanna.
She said that reporters are all over town.
I know you want to leave, but I really feel like
you need to be with family this weekend.
I will be with family. Maya's family.
I told you, Nate's parents are going to be there too.
It's our way of celebrating Maya
before this whole thing becomes all about Garrett.
And Nate's still just a friend?
He wasn't at first, but he is now.
I really need a friend this weekend.
Are you sure you don't want me to come?
Don't worry. He'll take good care of me.
Call me when you get there?
I will.
Oh. Thanks, Angie.
It actually makes me feel a lot better
knowing Emily's going to be far away from here tonight.
Yeah, me too.
So I'll pick you up at nine.
Yeah, see you then.
Toby?
No, please, don't let me go.
I'm so sorry for everything--
For all the secrets.
Spencer, I know who you are.
You never have to say you're sorry.
Here.
Thank you.
Ezra?
Love you, babe.
Expecting company?
It's probably Mrs. Rosenthal from next door.
She locks herself out at least once a week,
so I keep a key.
That's sweet.
It's right by the door.
Maggie?
It sounds like a cliche, but I was in the neighborhood.
Well, please come--come in.
Maggie, this is...
My girlfriend, Aria.
Ezra, there's something that I need to tell you.
It's really nice to meet you...Aria.
I'm picking up asignments here and there.
Seems like things are really starting to come together..
I think it's terrific that you're writing.
But why did you give up teaching?
Uh, it's complicated.
That is got to be Mrs. Rosenthal.
You know the truth. Why haven't you told him?
That's not something you spring on someone.
What are you doing here?
I was curious. He's the father of my son.
Yeah, he deserves to know that.
Did you come here to tell him?
Maybe.
I-- I'm not sure.
Look, I've been through a lot.
I need some time to sort this all out.
I've earned it, okay?
No.
No, it's not okay.
If he figures out that I'm lying to him--
He won't figure it out. I promise. Please.
There we go.
Wait. So what you're asking me to do--
There's more to this story than you know.
For Malcolm's sake,
I need to figure out what's best for him.
I'm not the only one here with a secret...Amy.
Can't remember her keys,
yet she never forgets dessert.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
I'll get plates for this.
Thank you.
Hey. I thought you were taking a shower.
Is that a gun?
Where did you get that?
You know what, I don't want to know. Just get rid of it.
Hanna, this "A" almost killed my mom.
Okay? I'm not letting you go
to that cemetery without some kind of protection.
Well, if you plan to bring that gun,
then you can forget about coming tonight.
It's not just your call, Hanna.
Is it loaded?
Listen to me, okay?
Caleb, I swear to god, get rid of that thing now
or don't let the door hit you in the ass in the way out.
All right.
I hear you.
It'll stay there until Monday and then I'll get rid of it.
Are you good with that?
Hey. It's gonna be okay.
I promise.
It just feels too easy...
Paige and Mona giving up like this.
We're gonna put an end to this tonight.
Now, remember,
there's two of them and four of us.
I'm here.
I understand.
Are you sure?
Yes.
Did you get that job in Bucks County just to get away from me?
I know it looks that way... but no.
You're going back.
Spencer...
I am exactly where I need to be.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, Han, it's Spence.
Please tell me that you have Maya's bag,
because I am so ready for this to be over.
Change of plans.
Right, the app is voice activated,
so it'll record any sound that it hears.
And I can pick up the feed,
so I'll be with you every step of the way.
Caleb, I think that you should take Maya's bag with you.
It's our only form of leverage, and if she doesn't admit
to digging up the body, she doesn't get the bag.
All right. I should just get out of sight.
What do we do now?
We wait for "A."
Hello?
You have one minute. Get out.
Nate?
It's ten-forty.
I get Mona being fashionably late,
But Paige? Something's not right.
We're meeting "A" In front of Ali's empty grave.
There's nothing right about this.
Who are you calling?
Nate.
Hey, Nate, it's Hanna. Can you give me a call back?
I just want to make sure that you guys are okay.
Caleb, do you see anything?
Nothing.
Not a car in sight.
Looks like a storm's on the way.
I went for a great hike.
It is dead up here.
Not a soul in sight.
Must be off season.
My parents will be here in a few hours.
Did you call your mom?
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Okay, there's a Lighthouse Rock Inn near bayhead.
There's one in Belmar, too.
Nate's still not answering.
Maybe Paige sent us here
to keep us away from Emily.
So she could get to her.
It's Caleb.
Hey, where are you going?
I just heard you.
I don't think Paige ever planned on meeting you guys.
I'm heading to Belmar.
You guys go to bayhead.
We'll call you later.
We're going to bayhead.
I brought some dvds.
I thought we might watch a movie later.
I'm not, um, really feeling that great.
I think I'm gonna get some fresh air.
I'll go with you.
It's really dark out.
I'll find my way.
You better wear your jacket.
It's cold out there.
Oh, my god. You scared me half to death.
Not really... But I will.
I wanted to give you this in person,
because I want to be there when you watch it.
I've said so many wrong things to you.
Emily, this is me taking the time to get it right.
I've been staying at Noel Kahn's cabin
trying to figure a way out of the mess that I got myself into
And I'm not totally sure,
but I think that stalker from true north found me,
I thought I saw him at a party the other night.
This isn't about him, it's about us.
I'm coming home, and...
If you still want to be with me,
if I can still count on us,
I know I can get through this.
How could you not fall in love with her smile?
Why do you have this?
I think you know the answer.
What you don't know...
is how much I loved her.
Don't look at me like that.
I said don't look me like that.
When I found you at the brew,
hearing you talk about Maya...
I felt so connected to her.
It's ironic.
You took her from me,
And then you gave me a little bit of her back.
Did you bring me here to kill me too?
I'm gonna do to you what you did to me.
I'm gonna take something from you,
and you are gonna watch me do it.
You're gonna make a right at the intersection.
How far away are you from Belmar?
I'm not sure. A couple of miles, maybe.
Can you just promise me that you'll be careful?
There it is on the hill.
Hanna...I love you.
I love you too, Caleb.
When we kissed,
I thought, "Maybe I don't have to hurt her.
Maybe I can move on with emily."
But just like Maya, you were playing me.
That's not true.
I gave you a choice. You picked her.
Looks like this place is closed.
Wait. No.
There's a light on in that cabin.
I want you to see this.
No. No!
My friends know I'm here.
My mom knows. They'll find you.
You underestimate me, Emily.
I have been planning this for months.
They think you're here with nate st. Germaine.
And he doesn't exist.
Who are you? Really?
Lyndon.
I'm Lyndon James.
Lyndon, you don't have to do this.
You can leave. You can walk away. I won't tell anybody.
I've waited as long as I could.
But I think Jenna saw me with Maya.
And now with her parents in town for the trial... time's up.
Damn it.
Em!
There's no one here. I'm calling Caleb.
Oh, come on.
Come on, come on.
Come on. Come on!
911, what is the nature of your emergency?
Hello?
Hello?
No!
Come here! Where are you going?
Emily! Emily.
Emily.
Emily.
Come here.
It's okay.
Caleb! No!!!
Caleb!!!
So, the deceased was a friend of yours?
Miss Fields, please.
I'm trying to understand what happened here.
When I was with Emily yesterday,
I got an anonymous text.
Ten P.M. Saturday, Rosewood cemetery,
or Emily gets hurt.
Did you know the victim?
Yes.
Was he a friend of yours?
He got me before I got there.
I can't do this right now.
Please just let me talk to my friend.
Officers.
I'm so sorry!
Han.
Caleb's still in surgery.
How ya holdin'p?
I'm fine.
Pam Fields, please pick up the nearest courtesy phone.
Must be dad.
No, I never reached him. He doesn't even know we're here.
Emily, I owe you one.
That was odd. There was no one there.
Mom, he's out of jail?
Emily, I'm so sorry you had to go through that tonight.
But I want you know that you helped an innocent victim.
Because of you, Garrett Reynolds is a free man.
If I knew Nate was gonna get Garrett out,
I would have stayed in tonight.
You have to get Maya's cell phone back.
That shouldn't be too difficult--
Paige doesn't even know she has it.
It sucks we didn't get to make that phone call.
Ring ring. "What's Paige doing with Maya's cell phone?
O-m-g. She must be the killer."
Oh, well, even the best laid plans go awry.
I'll see you soon.
