all i &apos;m saying is , if they took all the money they spent
trying to make a decent hulk movie ,
they could probably just make an actual hulk .
that is apt and amusing .
i think i shall share that with amy farrah fowler .
she &apos;ll appreciate the witticism .
thank you .
it &apos;ll also help improve her initial impression of you .
so what &apos;s going on with you two ?
well , the status is as it always was .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s a friend .
she is not my--
please forgive me for doing this--
&quot; girlfriend . &quot;
right , right .
so you &apos;re still just texting and emailing ?
you don &apos;t feel any need to hang out with her , you know--
be in the same room ?
leonard , you are my best friend .
i &apos;ve known you for seven years ,
and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you .
imagine my attitude regarding
prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler .
got it .
i sense judgment on your part .
no , no .
maybe a little .
may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy .
jealousy ? what do i have to be jealous of ?
i have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female .
you have none .
oh , right . that .
jealousy is an ugly green @-@ eyed monster--
not unlike the hulk--
who , by the way , also has a girlfriend .
in this iteration , jennifer connelly ,
whom you may recall as the girlfriend of russell crowe
in a beautiful mind ,
a feel @-@ good romp if there ever was one .
i &apos;m not jealous .
leonard not jealous .
you know , it just occurred to me ,
if there are an infinite number of parallel universes ,
in one of them , there &apos;s probably a sheldon
who doesn &apos;t believe parallel universes exist .
probably . what &apos;s your point ?
no point .
it &apos;s just one of the things
that makes one of the mes chuckle .
what makes you chuckle , leonard ?
hmm , recently ?
not much .
is it because of the conflict that arises
from your desperate need to pair @-@ bond with a woman ,
and the apparent collective decision of all womankind
to deny you that opportunity ?
um ...
shut up .
you know , when my grandfather died ,
and meemaw was alone , my mom arranged for her
to visit a center three times a week
where she could socialize with other lonely people .
it &apos;s very nice .
they discuss current events , play bridge , get a hot meal .
that sounds lovely .
it is if you like bridge .
do you like bridge , leonard ?
sheldon , i &apos;m just not dating someone right now .
i don &apos;t need to go to a senior center .
meemaw resisted at first , but now she loves it .
fine . if i don &apos;t meet someone soon ,
you can put me in a home .
it &apos;s not a home .
it &apos;s a senior center .
we &apos;d never put meemaw in a home !
hey , guys .
hey .
hey .
all right , i &apos;ll bow to social pressure : hey !
excuse me . that &apos;s my girlfriend , bernadette .
i assigned her her own ringtone--
&quot; bernadette , &quot; by the four tops .
hello , bernadette .
when i call him , his phone plays &quot; brown eyed girl . &quot;
which , now that i think about it , is not so good .
you realize he &apos;s just rubbing our noses in the fact
that he has a girlfriend , and we don &apos;t .
you mean , you don &apos;t .
you have a girlfriend ?
how could you have a girlfriend ?
you can &apos;t even speak to women .
two words-- deaf chick .
it doesn &apos;t matter if i can &apos;t talk ,
because she can &apos;t hear me .
what ?
that &apos;s what she said .
great . you have a girlfriend , howard &apos;s got a girlfriend ,
sheldon &apos;s got a girl ...
no , no , no , no !
... who &apos;s a friend .
thank you .
what about you , stuart ?
you have a girlfriend yet ?
oh , yeah . yeah .
i met her at comic @-@ con ,
the one place in the world where saying
&quot; i own a comic bookstore &quot;
is an actual pickup line .
oh . well , good for you .
not really . she &apos;s horrible .
when she wants to have sex ,
she puts on her plus @-@ size wonder woman costume and shouts ,
&quot; who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane ? &quot;
why don &apos;t you just break up with her ?
no , no , i can &apos;t .
why not ?
&apos;cause then i &apos;d be alone ,
like you .
dude , why don &apos;t you just invoke
your girlfriend pact with wolowitz ?
because i don &apos;t need his girlfriend
to set me up with one of her girlfriends .
i &apos;m perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own .
oh , leonard , you remind me
of the funny old story about a man
who walks into a women &apos;s correctional institution
with a stack of paperwork
that will allow the female convicts to go free .
you &apos;re saying i couldn &apos;t get laid
in a women &apos;s prison with a handful of pardons .
are you going to let me tell the story or not ?
leonard ?
are you sleeping ?
no .
are you ill ?
no .
are you still depressed
because you &apos;re alone , and no one loves you ?
i don &apos;t know . maybe .
i want you to know that i &apos;m genuinely concerned
about your well @-@ being .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
but it &apos;s still no reason to have your feet in my spot .
may i offer an observation ?
what the hell ? how long has she been here ?
since we got home from the comic bookstore .
that was two hours ago .
as per your suggestion ,
we &apos;re hanging out .
quite frankly , i don &apos;t see
what all the hoopla &apos;s about .
go on , amy .
from a neurobiological standpoint , leonard ,
you may be alone
because your psychological state is causing
an actual pheromone @-@ based stink of desperation .
did you know that , leonard ?
no .
i did .
i understand that some people find mates
in social gathering places such as bars or taverns .
have you tried a bar or tavern ?
no , i &apos;m not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar .
wise decision . you see , amy ,
success at a bar is based on classic male attributes
such as height , strength , attractiveness ,
the ability to hold one &apos;s liquor and throw darts --
separately or together .
leonard has none of these attributes ,
right , leonard ?
right .
that &apos;s not true of all bars .
juice bars , for example .
oh ! good point , amy .
yeah , building on your premise ,
leonard could frequent sushi bars ,
salad bars , oyster bars ,
the apple genius bar ... what are you doing ?
keep going . i &apos;m listening .
that was rude .
he does it all the time .
he &apos;s a cornucopia of social awkwardness .
cornucopia .
what a mellifluous word .
let &apos;s make that our word of the day .
agreed . and we &apos;ll use mellifluous tomorrow .
well , i have to void my bladder .
it was nice spending this time with you .
wait .
i have a request .
yes ?
i &apos;d like you to meet my mother .
i see .
can i get back to you on that ?
certainly . good night .
good night .
leonard , leonard , leonard ,
leonard , leonard , leonard ,
leonard , leonard , leonard ,
leonard , leonard , leonard ,
leonard , leonard , leonard ,
leonard , leonard ,
leonard , leonard ...
yeah , what ?
amy farrah fowler has asked me to meet her mother .
yeah . so ?
what does that mean ?
well , you know how you &apos;re always saying
that amy is a girl who &apos;s your friend ,
and not your girlfriend ?
uh @-@ huh .
you can &apos;t say that anymore .
wait . what ?
look , she obviously wants
to take your relationship to the next level .
i don &apos;t want the next level .
i like this level .
fix it for me !
me ?
well , how am i supposed to fix it ?
simple ! you want a girlfriend ,
amy wants to be someone &apos;s girlfriend .
take her off my hands . i give you my blessing .
that is insane .
you &apos;re right . it would never work .
amy finds you tedious .
okay , good luck .
wait ! what am i supposed to do ?
well , have you considered telling her how you feel ?
leonard , i &apos;m a physicist , not a hippie .
all right , well , let me see
if i can explain your situation using physics .
what would you be
if you were attached to another object
by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis ?
screwed .
there you go .
amy &apos;s right .
he is tedious .
howard , get the door !
why can &apos;t you get it ?
you know i &apos;m doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy !
i &apos;m like an upside @-@ down volcano here .
oh , hey .
i hope you didn &apos;t hear that .
the volcano thing ? no .
what &apos;s with the t @-@ shirt ?
you working at the apple store now ?
no , it &apos;s just something i threw on .
i know all your shirts .
that &apos;s not one of them ...
you were pretending to work at the genius bar
to pick up women , weren &apos;t you ?
yeah .
turns out , they guard the ipods ,
but they don &apos;t guard the shirts .
so , how &apos;d it go ?
it was going well .
i was showing this super hot girl
how to boot up in safe mode .
the manager got suspicious , and , well , long story short ,
they really do have a little jail in the mall .
just fyi , don &apos;t try to go back with a fake mustache .
i mean , they may not really be geniuses ,
but they see right through that .
i want to invoke the girlfriend pact , howard .
you that desperate ?
no , i just ... i want what you have .
you know , i want a woman in my life .
holy moses ,
how much liquid can be in one tokus ?
to be clear , i meant like bernadette , not your mother .
yeah , i know what you mean .
well , i &apos;m off to meet bernadette &apos;s friend .
how do i look ?
as if one of the plants
from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way ,
only with an absurd amount of hair gel .
what are you working on ?
i &apos;m removing my digital footprint from the internet
so amy farrah fowler can &apos;t find me
and compel me to meet her mother . ah .
you &apos;re going off the grid .
exactly .
the old unabomber approach . kudos .
thank you .
i &apos;ve also sent amy a relationship termination notice
and changed my cell phone number and e @-@ mail address .
what if she just comes over ?
she &apos;ll get lost .
we no longer live at 2311 los robles .
we now live at 311 los robles .
you changed the address on the building ?
what about mail ?
oh , no worries-- i explained my predicament
to our letter carrier .
he was sympathetic .
his exact words were :
&quot; got your back , jack .
bitches be crazy . &quot;
who is it ?
amy farrah fowler .
darn ! she found me !
she &apos;s been here before .
the only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan .
now , get my back , jack .
what do you want to do ?
tell her i &apos;m not here .
okay , where are you ?
i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;ll have to devise a scenario
that plausibly explains my absence ,
keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details .
hi , amy .
sheldon &apos;s not here .
all right .
way to go on the details .
thanks again for doing this , bernadette .
oh , i take pacts very seriously .
one time at my lab ,
a petri dish of genetically modified super @-@ virus went missing .
that day we made a pinky swear never to admit
we crossed ebola with the common cold .
why the hell
would you cross ebola with the common cold ?
we never did .
that would be a terrible , terrible thing .
hi . sorry i &apos;m late-- i was at the gym .
spin class-- worked up quite a sweat .
joy , this is leonard . leonard , this is joy .
hi .
hi .
you don &apos;t look like a genius .
go ahead , say something smart .
uh ... aah ! time &apos;s up .
just kidding .
first thing you need to know about me :
i &apos;m hilarious .
yeah .
so , bernadette tells me
she knows you from self @-@ defense classes ?
yeah . israeli krav maga .
lots of fun .
basically , a hundred different ways
to rip a guy &apos;s nuts off .
wow . wouldn &apos;t think there &apos;d be that many .
number 42 !
whoa !
isn &apos;t she a pip ?

hey , this is a date , right ?
yep , it is .
73 !
excuse me , i have to go to the little girls &apos; room ...
and take a wicked whiz .
i &apos;ll go with you .
fair warning-- i had the asparagus .
my pea is gonna stink up the place .
i think she likes you .
ez aquarii b ...
ez aquarii c ...
excuse me , madam .
sheldon ?
rats !
i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred
when i asked you to meet my mother .
no misunderstanding .
i &apos;ve learned what that request actually means ,
and i don &apos;t want to be joined to another object
by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis .
in what way are you screwed ?
all i want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother
so she &apos;ll be satisfied that i &apos;m in a relationship .
so we &apos;d be perpetrating a ruse ?
precisely .
and you haven &apos;t fallen hopelessly in love with me ?
don &apos;t be absurd .
i find the notion of romantic love
to be an unnecessary cultural construct
that adds no value to human relationships .
amy farrah fowler , that &apos;s the most pragmatic thing
anyone has ever said to me .
i trust this clarification allows us to return
to boy @-@ slash @-@ friend @-@ slash @-@ girl @-@ slash @-@ friend status .
of course .
would you like to join me for chinese food ?
sheldon , please , you &apos;re suffocating me .
my apologies .
good night , amy .
good night , sheldon .
come on , just give her a chance .
maybe she &apos;ll grow on you .
or maybe she &apos;ll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off .
there are still 93 ways she hasn &apos;t tried yet .
look , h @-@ howard , i appreciate
the effort , but this is , like , the worst date of my life .
seriously ?
i was once robbed by a pre @-@ op transsexual i met on j @-@ date ,
and that didn &apos;t even crack my top ten .
i guess the difference is , i have some self @-@ respect .
not that i &apos;ve ever seen .
it &apos;s relatively new .
i just know that
i &apos;m not gonna spend time with someone i don &apos;t like
simply to have a girlfriend .
i &apos;m okay on my own .
good news-- i made lots of room for dessert .
look , uh , joy , it was nice to meet you , but ...
yeah , you , too . hey , you got anything for next weekend ?
i need a date for my cousin &apos;s wedding .
you &apos;re asking me out ?
yeah .
and it &apos;s an open bar ,
so i &apos;ll probably be giving it away .
i look forward to it .
it &apos;s nice to meet you , too , sheldon .
i honestly didn &apos;t believe amy
when she told me she had a boyfriend .
i assure you i &apos;m quite real .
and i &apos;m having regular intercourse with your daughter .
what ?
oh , yes .
we &apos;re like wild animals in heat .
it &apos;s a wonder neither of us has been hurt .
amy ... what is he saying ?
you wanted me to have a boyfriend , mother .
well , here he is .
have to sign off now .
my hunger for sheldon is stirring in my loins .
oh , yes , it &apos;s time for me to make love
to your daughter &apos;s vagina .
thank you , sheldon , that went very well .
agreed .
amy , i find myself wondering
if we should actually engage in coitus
at least one time in our relationship .
bazinga .
