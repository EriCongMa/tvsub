gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
you accused me of getting charlie to turn dan against you .
well , she just did the same thing to me .
your mom told me the last time things went well ,
you stopped taking them .
and then they went from well to hell .
call me serena .
what ?
let us all raise a glass
to the prince and princess @-@ to @-@ be .
i hope you &apos;ll join me at this party .
if you &apos;re not ready to share your life ,
don &apos;t show up .
chuck bass . what a disappointment .
have you seen the real blair ?
don &apos;t you read &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
you lost her to the prince .
not yet , i haven &apos;t .
you &apos;re the reason my mother is dead .
did chuck bass tell you that ?
my nephew is at the edge of a cliff again .
nothing turns him upside down like losing blair waldorf .
uh , someone called me from the building
and--and told me that chuck bass was up here .
he was threatening to jump and asking for me .
well , at least now we know why
charlie &apos;s been acting so unbalanced .
yeah , because she is .
we need to find dan before something happens to him .
and we need to find charlie before something happens to her .
you know , this isn &apos;t her fault . she needs help .
the last time this happened , she ended up wandering
through the snow in her bare feet .
yeah , after she &quot; single white female &apos;d &quot; her college roommate .
rufus said the girl &apos;s boyfriend led her on .
fine . she &apos;s in your dress with your ex , but if you &apos;re
so concerned about charlie ,
you find her , and i &apos;ll find dan .
you know , maybe i should be the one to tell dan
what &apos;s going on . at least he considers me a friend ,
which is more than you can say right now .
and whose fault is that ?
yours .
you know what ? let &apos;s--let &apos;s not do this .
why don &apos;t we both tell dan together ?
and we &apos;ll both find charlie together .
fine . let &apos;s go .
look at this place . we &apos;ve been-- we &apos;ve been gone two years ?
feels like 20 . is raina here ?
no , she &apos;s not . she , uh , asked to be alone .
is everything okay ?
not really . you seem a little shaken up yourself .
what &apos;s going on ?
charlie said something that kinda weirded me out .
i &apos;m hoping it &apos;s just a crazy misunderstanding
and not actual crazy .
what &apos;d she say ?
uh , well , uh , we ... were kissing , you know ?
and then things started to , you know ...
so then she says , &quot; call me serena . &quot;
what ?
yeah .
are you sure ?
i mean , maybe that &apos;s just what you wanted to hear .
nice one , but yeah , yeah , i &apos;m sure .
no , but if she really did say that ,
that &apos;s definitely weird .
just tell her that &apos;s not necessary
and get back to doing whatever it is
you two were gonna do .
what &apos;s chuck doing here ?
&quot; gossip girl &quot; said he was headed to rehab .
yeah . that &apos;s ... another long story .
what , we &apos;re at st. jude &apos;s , so now suddenly
i &apos;m back out of the loop with everything ?
look , i &apos;ll tell you later , i promise .
ms. waldorf , i can &apos;t find blair .
well , she &apos;s bound to be here somewhere .
she left well before me .
oh , there &apos;s the princess and louis .
do you think she &apos;d miss the opportunity
to enter her old stomping ground on the arm of a prince ?
she is finally getting her fairy tale .
she doesn &apos;t need the big bad wolf to ruin it .
why don &apos;t you say good @-@ bye once and for all ?
and let her go .
oh , hey , you know , if school was more like this during the day ,
i think i might have enjoyed it .
thank god my student days are almost over .
have you seen charlie ?
hey , we need to talk . we need to talk to you .
i need to talk to you .
hey , i need to talk to you .
okay , whoa , just tell me that no one &apos;s trying to stop
a wedding , run a ponzi scheme , give anybody fake cancer ,
or turn into a justifiably vengeful townie ?
usually i &apos;m the one trying to get all of you people to listen to me .
as much as it pains me to think
you might know the answer
to this question , do you know where blair is ?
what we have to say is far more important
than the location of blair waldorf .
yeah , we think charlie &apos;s in trouble ,
and we need to find her .
at least you &apos;re okay , though . i was worried about you .
chuck , you gotta listen to me . raina--
i was worried about you , too , but , you know ,
now we &apos;re both worried about charlie .
nathaniel , i can &apos;t even think about raina
until i know where blair is .
everybody , please , shut up . i haven &apos;t seen blair ,
and i &apos;ve been around the room a couple times tonight .
but whatever nate needs to tell you is--is obviously important ,
so i think you should hear him out .
as for charlie ,
she has been acting a little strange ,
and i haven &apos;t seen her . i &apos;m looking for her , too .
what are you two doing together ?
don &apos;t you hate each other ?
you tell him .
a half hour ago , i saw blair talking to that girl
wearing serena &apos;s dress ,
and then she just bolted .
nathaniel , if you still need to talk to me ,
i &apos;m going to the empire to see if blair &apos;s there .
right behind you .
look who got cute .
uh , still gay .
that means you can dance .
so what &apos;s up with charlie ?
i don &apos;t understand . i specifically asked you
not to tell raina the truth .
i had no choice . she wanted to go after you .
if she confronted her father with any of this ,
now he will .
there will be repercussions , believe me .
until i find blair ,
i can &apos;t even think about russell thorpe .
you might have to .
i &apos;m sorry for just showing up like this .
i didn &apos;t know where to go . my father was so angry ,
blaming you for all that &apos;s happened .
and after everything that i put you through ,
i just wanted to apologize .
no need to apologize to me . we both did things
we didn &apos;t know were wrong in the moment .
still .
thanks . blair isn &apos;t here , is she ?
no , and i &apos;ve been here at least a half an hour .
so if she &apos;s not here , she &apos;s not at home or at the party ,
where is she ?
hello ?
i don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re doing this .
you tricked me into coming to chuck &apos;s new hotel
by saying that he was in jeopardy ,
and now you won &apos;t let me leave . what am i supposed to do ,
jump from the third story window ?
come on . i know where blair is .
smart girl .
you and chuck might not be together , ms. waldorf ,
but from what i can tell ,
you &apos;re still the thing he loves most in the world .
you &apos;re not going anywhere tonight .
bonsoir , upper east siders .
are you enjoying the party as much as i am ?
i know one person who isn &apos;t .
and this is our beautiful milo .
he &apos;s 10 months old , the little guy .
o.m.g. so cute ! is he sleeping through the night ?
from 8 : 00 till 6 : 00 . i get up with him
so georgina can sleep in .
your life sounds perfect .
it is .
so how did you two meet ?
well , that &apos;s a real romantic story .
phil wanted a hot wife to impress his partners ,
and i wanted a loft and a legacy at yale for milo .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i &apos;m going to go get drunk enough
to make you all seem interesting .
dan .
oh , of course you &apos;d be here .
oh , i can tell that you &apos;re up to something .
please let me in on it .
i haven &apos;t been this bored since i believed in jesus .
if i was up to something , and i &apos;m not saying that i am ,
the last thing i would want
is georgina sparks getting involved .
not unless the thing was twisted and nasty ,
in which case my help could prove invaluable .
how &apos;s the party ?
oh , i promise , mom , you &apos;re not missing anything ,
unless you think amy chua trying to convince headmistress queller
to grade her kids more harshly is exciting .
check your e @-@ mail .
thank you . you &apos;re a good son .
is that eric at the party ?
yeah .
hey , eric ,
have serena and vanessa found charlie yet ?
i don &apos;t know . why ?
uh , well , she &apos;s gone off of her--
don &apos;t embarrass her . she &apos;ll be fine .
um , look , um , if you see serena ,
have her give me a call and check in , okay ?
yeah , yeah , i &apos;ll find her right now .
oh , mrs. harrington , mr. harrington , i &apos;m so sorry .
charlie , put down the bottle .
what are you doing ? why are you even here ?
oh , obviously it &apos;s a mistake if you &apos;re anywhere near me .
listen , maybe ... i @-@ i think i overreacted before .
i mean , what you said-- it took me by surprise .
but the more i think about it , the more i get it .
you just want me to like you . well , i already do .
so what do you say about a do @-@ over ?
we can go somewhere and just talk about this ? come on .
yeah , why did you lead me on for weeks ?
why didn &apos;t you just tell me you didn &apos;t like me ?
i mean , is that something you learned from serena ? because--
excuse me , sir .
all right , we need a plan &quot; b. &quot;
serena .
oh , headmistress queller .
have you met our distinguished alum cecily ?
we &apos;ve never met , but i &apos;ve read a lot about you .
hi . nice to meet you .
bye .
so ... how is providence ?
i &apos;m at columbia , actually .
oh . what happened to brown ?
uh , well , i deferred for a year ,
and then when it was time to go back ,
my dad helped get me into columbia
so i could be close to my friends and family .
oh , i know i was always hard on you , serena ,
but it was only because
i thought you could become something .
i had hoped you &apos;d leave new york ,
see the world ,
maybe find your place somewhere far away from all this .
oh , well , maybe after college .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
excuse me ? please don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re gonna lecture me
about my choice of college , too .
college ? no . but how could you
not end up with nate or dan ?
we both voted on &quot; gossip girl &apos;s &quot; poll ,
and we both lost .
so who did you end up with--
the billionaire , or the guy who tried to kill you ?
neither , actually .
i used to wanna be like you ,
but now i wanna be blair .
at least she &apos;s going to be a princess .
okay , shoo . i &apos;m perfectly happy with my life ,
but thank you for your concern .
oh , spoke too soon .
i &apos;d ask how you are , but i don &apos;t really care .
i &apos;ll take that as an opportunity to answer anyway .
i mean , i @-@ i &apos;d say i &apos;m great .
look at my hair , my clothes , my body ,
but i &apos;ve actually become a bedford wife ,
and it &apos;s really just the worst thing .
please let me in on whatever scheme
everyone seems to be a part of .
i haven &apos;t conspired since i convinced
dan he was milo &apos;s dad .
unless you count speeding up the process at a hospice
to get someone &apos;s apartment .
a @-@ anyway , i @-@ i &apos;m sure i can be useful .
not to me .
i had charlie , but she slipped away .
she &apos;s gotta be around here somewhere .
i &apos;m sorry . she &apos;s a part of the gang , but i &apos;m not ?
mine &apos;s from charlie .
mine , too .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . good @-@ bye &quot; ? who is this amateur ?
serena &apos;s cousin . she &apos;s in trouble .
we have to come up with a new plan .
the badger .
th @-@ the melon drop . the spanish prisoner .
divide and conquer . she could be anywhere .
yeah , i &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll go to my dad &apos;s in case she goes home .
i &apos;ll go to the loft in case she shows there .
i &apos;ll stay here in case she comes back .
okay . what do i do ?
you can just go away .
i don &apos;t understand .
if you &apos;re not gonna torture me or wh @-@ whatever ,
why don &apos;t you just let me leave ?
and why do you keep doing that ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s taking longer than i thought .
what is ?
she said she was on the third floor .
do you smell something weird ? like ...
gas . i &apos;m calling 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
i turned it on before you got here ,
but this place is big and drafty .
don &apos;t , don &apos;t !
i ... i @-@ i know you think the basses are evil .
trust me . i get it .
i loved chuck for so long , and ...
he just punished me for it .
he ended up treating me like something he owned
instead of something he earned ,
and it destroyed me .
i @-@ i thought i &apos;d never get over it .
but ...
i finally found a way out of the darkness and ...
you can , too .
no , i can &apos;t .
don &apos;t ! stop !
chuck !
dad ?
raina .
you shouldn &apos;t be here .
neither should you ,
but if you go through with this , you &apos;re taking me with you ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m not leaving without you .
i know you didn &apos;t mean to hurt my mother .
the fire was an accident .
i forgive you .
you &apos;re going to jail for a very long time ,
and i won &apos;t be coming to visit you , ever .
this just in--blair waldorf m.i.a. at constance .
doesn &apos;t she know her prince is waiting ?
or has she found a new one ?
nate and raina are giving their statements to the cops .
you sure you don &apos;t wanna go to the hospital , get checked out ?
i &apos;m fine , or i will be .
i just wanna get outta here .
louis is waiting for me .
i &apos;ll drive you .
thank you ...
not only for the ride
but for , you know , saving me .
what was i supposed to do ? you called .
only because i couldn &apos;t see my phone to dial 9 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
i still have you on speed dial .
i just had to push down the 1 .
the 1 , huh ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know .
how about a drink to calm your nerves ?
then we can return you to your prince as steady as ever ?
okay .
one drink . that &apos;s all .
thank you .
nate ...
i wanna go home .
okay . we can , uh , get another cab ,
go to your hotel .
i don &apos;t mean the hotel .
you mean chicago .
oh , my .
closed for joseph nitzberg &apos;s bar mitzvah .
the nitzbergs have great taste .
maybe we should just go back to the party .
why ? pretty much everyone we
or gossip girl knows is there ,
which means it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been given
the rest of the night off to do what we want .
like that movie &quot; death takes a holiday &quot; ?
not the brad pitt remake . that was horrible .
what ? it was .
&quot; helen and murray erlich &quot; sound nice .
shall we ?
you scared me .
i get that a lot .
do you know where i could find a window that opens ?
most of them seem to be nailed shut ,
and i could really use the fresh air .
top floor , last room at the end of the hall .
thanks for helping me .
have you seen charlie ?
maybe i have . maybe i haven &apos;t .
this is serious . every second you don &apos;t tell me
where she went is critical . look , what if your kid
in 17 years was in trouble and needed help ?
if milo isn &apos;t in trouble in 17 years ,
then i &apos;ve done something wrong , but fine .
i &apos;ll tell you where charlie went , but you owe me .
she took the elevator .
thank you .
i miss you ! you get me !
charlie . you here ?
也就是我高二的时候
so that &apos;s it .
time to go back to the real world . you ready ?
i &apos;m sorry , my dear , but you need to give this up .
blair isn &apos;t coming .
you asked her a question , and this is her answer .
you know , the last thing i wanted was to see you be hurt .
and look what has happened .
i know she &apos;ll be here .
no , carol . i &apos;m sorry . we still haven &apos;t been able to find her .
i &apos;ll try vanessa , see if she had any luck .
okay . no , we have everyone looking .
watch out , s.
we find what we look for ...
charlie .
but never where we expect .
charlie , no .
charlie , what are you doing ? please come down from there .
i heard you talk to dan and vanessa about me .
you think i &apos;m crazy . everyone does .
no , we don &apos;t . we think you have a condition that can be helped .
if you come down , we can talk about it .
i @-@ i &apos;ll get dan if you want .
dan doesn &apos;t like me .
that &apos;s why i stole your dress .
i &apos;ll never be like you .
you &apos;re ... serena van der woodsen .
that doesn &apos;t mean what you think it means .
you okay ? you didn &apos;t call when you got in . is charlie there ?
no , i &apos;m sorry . i just ... i got caught up .
i found your book .
my what ?
&quot; inside . &quot; dan , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s incredible .
you went through my stuff ?
vanessa , you have no right to do that .
i know , and i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just this could be the best satire
on the upper east side since &quot; bonfire of the vanities . &quot;
how long have you been working on this ?
uh , five years , off and on .
now put it back , and we can forget you found it .
i always thought serena was the reason
you fell into the upper east side ,
but it was more than that .
vanessa , seriously , this is none of your business .
you always wanted in ,
maybe more than jenny .
of course , the irony is that if i ever show it to anyone ,
it &apos;ll guarantee my outsider status forever .
dan , you know as well as i do you can &apos;t be an insider
and make great art .
you have to stand alone to observe it
and not care whose feelings you hurt
or what people think of you .
those people are my friends , my best friends ,
my family .
well , it &apos;s not like any of them come across worse than you do ,
and there &apos;s a certain someone
that might actually like the way she &apos;s painted .
and i &apos;m not talking about serena .
get it published . take a stand .
be a great man instead of always being a good boy .
serena found charlie . i need to go .
and you need to put the book back and get out of my room .
dan , this is important .
don &apos;t just drop everything to run and help them .
good @-@ bye , vanessa .
when are you gonna realize that you are better person
until the day you asked serena out four years ago ?
when are you gonna realize that i had a better life
before you climbed up my fire escape four years ago ?
so ...
i should find louis and tell him it &apos;s over .
if that &apos;s what you want .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
you really love him , don &apos;t you ?
yes .
but not like i love you .
louis and i-- it &apos;s different .
it &apos;s lighter , more simple .
he makes me happy .
and i don &apos;t .
what we have is a great love .
it &apos;s complicated , intense ,
all @-@ consuming .
no matter what we do and how much we fight ,
it &apos;ll always pull us in .
what &apos;s mere happiness in the face of all that , right ?
so ...
i &apos;m sure louis has left the party by now ,
so i &apos;ll have to tell him at the consulate .
drop me off at constance ,
then you can take the limo .
are you really going to tell me
that there &apos;s something wrong with being you ?
every girl wants to be you .
every guy wants to date you .
you can do anything you want .
so can you .
all night , i @-@ i &apos;ve realized ,
i didn &apos;t choose college .
i never chose between dan or nate .
i didn &apos;t even choose paris last year .
blair told me i was going .
trust me , i @-@ i know what it feels like .
when you &apos;re not making your own decisions ,
you can feel helpless because you don &apos;t wanna hurt anyone .
but all you end up doing is hurting them and yourself .
it &apos;s what i did , and here i am , alone .
you &apos;re not alone .
i &apos;m here .
good .
but if you could do it over again ,
who would you choose ?
dan or nate ?
what are you doing ?
you &apos;re still here .
why wouldn &apos;t i be ?
the party &apos;s almost over .
i know .
but blair hasn &apos;t arrived yet .
how can you be sure she &apos;s even coming ?
because i love her , and just as important ,
i believe in her .
i know she &apos;s scared , but she &apos;ll figure it out .
and i &apos;ll be here when she does .
you left your ...
i knew you would come .
i &apos;m sorry it took me so long . we need to talk .
i see .
louis ...
blair ...
no , i need to do this myself .
what i need to tell you is--
what &apos;s she &apos;s trying to say is you have my blessing .
i couldn &apos;t be more happy the two of you are getting married .
poor b.
don &apos;t you know timing is everything ?
looks like someone just stepped on your lines .
hey , what are you doing up here ?
meeting serena . you , too , huh ?
why do i feel like we &apos;ve been here before ?
hey , how you feeling ?
i &apos;ll be okay . thanks .
so what are we doing here ?
i owe you both an apology .
did something happen i don &apos;t know about ?
no , it &apos;s not what happened .
it &apos;s what didn &apos;t happen .
last fall , i asked you to wait around .
while i figured things out , and--and i never really did .
so i &apos;m sorry if i hurt you both .
i @-@ i hope you can find a way to forgive me .
of course we can .
we already have ,
but it means a lot to hear it from you .
i &apos;m sorry , too , for everything i did that caused problems ,
but especially for the way i acted with you , dan .
all right , well , what do you say we get your coat ?
i &apos;ll take you home .
i &apos;d like that . thank you .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t have wanted to be you before ,
but now i definitely do .
i &apos;ll get our coats .
i &apos;ll get a cab .
hey , i should call my mom and let her know that i &apos;m okay .
okay . i &apos;ll be down there .
hey , it &apos;s me .
i thought you should know it went perfectly .
i &apos;ll see you soon .
did you find that open window ?
yeah .
but i shouldn &apos;t have been looking for it anyways .
i , um , was just off my minds .
no , i don &apos;t think so .
i don &apos;t think you were ever on minds .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m not gonna bust you .
since i assume you &apos;re about to be shipped off somewhere ,
if you &apos;re ever back in the city , let me know .
it &apos;s been getting a little dull around here .
why did you just do that ?
&apos;cause of what you said earlier .
about being happy ?
chuck , that &apos;s not the most important thing .
people don &apos;t write sonnets about being compatible
or novels about shared life goals
and stimulating conversation .
the great loves are the crazy ones . &quot; l &apos;amour fou . &quot;
blair , we &apos;re not living in paris in the &apos; 20s .
we both wish we were .
there &apos;s a difference between a great love
and the right love .
i left the empire state building last year after two minutes
when you didn &apos;t show .
louis waited all night .
this is your chance at happiness .
you think you shouldn &apos;t want it
&apos;cause you &apos;ve never had it ,
and it scares you .
but you deserve your fairy tale .
we make our own fairy tales .
only when we have to . you don &apos;t .
how do you feel about tonight ?
awful .
just ...
terrible .
in fact , i &apos;ve never felt like this before .
guilt .
i feel it , too .
maybe i &apos;m actually growing up after all .
i didn &apos;t wanna let you go just yet .
don &apos;t let anyone tell you you &apos;re not powerful .
you &apos;re the most powerful woman i know .
it &apos;s taking all the power
i have to walk away from you .
i know .
but i need to let you go .
you need to let go .
i will always love you .
i will always love you .
thank you for waiting .
i had to say good @-@ bye .
this just in--
chuck bass and blair waldorf ,
happily never after .
they say parting is such sweet sorrow ,
but wouldn &apos;t it be nice if just once it didn &apos;t have to be ?
they &apos;re saying 20 years .
sounds fair . that &apos;s how long he kept the secret .
well , i wouldn &apos;t wanna be in his shoes . i can tell you that .
what about your shoes ? when is that happening ?
yeah , what are your plans for the summer , mrs. humphrey ?
well , i &apos;m going to be getting very pale .
this thing doesn &apos;t come off until the fall ,
just in time to send my baby off to college .
oh , sarah lawrence is , like , 15 minutes away .
i don &apos;t really think i need to be sent off .
a @-@ a light breeze could take me there .
at least you don &apos;t have to worry about sun damage ,
and we don &apos;t have to spend the month of august
with eleanor and cyrus on that cruise like they suggested .
can you imagine ?
i don &apos;t think the principality of monaco &apos;s yacht
counts as a cruise , mr. humphrey .
well , they didn &apos;t mention that .
maybe there &apos;s still time to r.s.v.p.
well , on that note , i think i &apos;ll head out , nathaniel .
i &apos;ll hitch a ride .
so ... monaco for the summer .
yeah , louis is picking me up in an hour .
flying private ?
is there anything else ?
so you &apos;re really getting married , huh ?
yes , and you &apos;re actually going to be invited .
i bet you never thought you &apos;d get to go to a royal wedding .
only my own . you think you could introduce me
to charlotte casiraghi ?
listen , if the castle gets lonely ,
um , you wanna watch a movie with a friend ...
i already copied your queue . our e @-@ mail discourse
begins monday with hal ashby &apos;s &quot; the landlord , &quot;
and we &apos;ll take it from there .
okay .
hello ?
uh , it &apos;s your car here to take you to the bus .
are you sure you wanna take the bus , honey ?
yes . after everything i &apos;ve been through ,
i could really use the downtime .
my mother was right .
this city isn &apos;t the best place for me .
maybe someday i can come back and stay centered ,
but for now , back to florida .
thank you .
bye .
i &apos;m sad . i kinda liked having a cousin around .
me , too .
i really did like you .
i really did like you , too .
transitions in life are usually marked by major events--
birthdays . graduations , weddings .
you must really be hurting .
how can you tell ?
you &apos;re not drinking . i always know it &apos;s serious
when even you know you can &apos;t dull the pain .
i &apos;m not right for her . we bring out the dark side in each other .
when she &apos;s with louis , she shines .
that &apos;s the blair i love .
if she needs to be with him to be it ,
then that &apos;s the way it should be .
well , look at that-- chuck bass , maturing .
sad but true , i &apos;m afraid .
i had victor pick this up . being at st. jude &apos;s
reminded me of all the lost weekends we used to have .
so why not graduate to a lost summer ?
i &apos;m intrigued .
just spin the globe and pick a point .
we can start there and make our way back here ,
like old times--bachelors who don &apos;t have to answer to anybody .
you &apos;re a good friend .
one of us has to be .
but the greater transitions
often come out of smaller moments ...
when we stop and look at who we are .
because each time we see how far we &apos;ve come ,
we also see how far we still have to go .
hey , can i borrow your sun hat ?
only if i can take your espadrilles .
i can &apos;t wait for monaco .
strolling in the jardin exotique ,
catching the exhibits at villa paloma ,
eating the lievre la royale at le louis xv .
while i lay on the beach in montecito , off the radar ,
learning to surf , strolling through the farmers &apos; market ,
while cece with a teacup of gin in hand ,
harasses the help .
well , you &apos;re gonna have a lot of fun , but are you sure
you wanna be all by yourself the whole summer ?
i know a palace with an empty room or 50 .
being alone is just what i need--no boys , no bars ,
just a bottle of sunblock
and a dozen of the best beach reads .
i needed to make a choice , and--and i choose me .
well , who knows ? maybe the grimaldis &apos; yacht
can moor for a couple days in malibu and we can meet up .
oh , i &apos;d love that .
hey , have you picked a date yet ?
we &apos;re thinking november .
well , that doesn &apos;t give me nearly enough time
to find a dress to outshine yours ,
and you know i &apos;ll be wearing white , of course .
what are you talking about ? i already told louis &apos; seamstresses
to make you a maid of honor dress
from the brightest fuchsia they could find .
thank you .
of course .
so with lily locked up all summer ,
you don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna get a little stir @-@ crazy ?
not really . i &apos;m producing
panic &apos;s album in the city , so i &apos;ll have lots of company .
what about the house in the hamptons ?
i mean , is cece gonna be there this year ?
no , she &apos;s staying in montecito for serena .
ah . you know , i &apos;m actually ashamed to admit this ,
but i was kinda looking forward to spending some time out there .
since when do you like the hamptons ?
i wouldn &apos;t mind leaving the city .
it &apos;s been getting me down .
you sad about charlie leaving ?
i know you two were getting close .
it &apos;s not charlie he &apos;s talking about .
whoever or whatever it is , the hamptons house is empty .
you can have it all for yourself .
would you wanna come with ?
we could be each other &apos;s wingmen like nate and chuck .
maybe break up a couple or two .
uh , yeah , thank you . get me outta here .
who knows ? with all the , uh , relaxing you do ,
maybe you can get a little writing done while you &apos;re there .
i don &apos;t know . i think maybe , uh , my writing days are behind me .
you were right . i loved it .
so did my team here .
we think it &apos;s one of the best debut novels
since jonathan safran foer . who exactly wrote it ?
i promised my client i wouldn &apos;t say ,
but i &apos;m sure once it &apos;s published ,
the author will come forward . he &apos;ll--he &apos;ll have to .
where should we send the checks ?
to me . i &apos;ll pass them along to the author .
barcelona ?
i &apos;m moving there .
nothing &apos;s really keeping me here .
in order to fully transform ,
we might need to free ourselves
of everything we &apos;ve been holding on to .
to send us on our new path-- the right one .
uh , hi .
hi . sorry .
do we know each other ?
no , no , no . it &apos;s just &quot; the beautiful and damned &quot; --
it &apos;s one of my favorite novels .
i can &apos;t believe you were reading it .
normally , people only read novels around here
because they &apos;re trying to turn them into movies , so .
which is exactly what you &apos;re doing , isn &apos;t it ?
i kind of lied to my boss about having already read it .
i &apos;m supposed to do a scene @-@ by @-@ scene comparison
of the book to the script . meeting &apos;s in an hour .
any chance you could help me ?
well , i don &apos;t know how i feel
about helping someone cut corners .
but if it &apos;s for the good of fitzgerald , i suppose
i don &apos;t have to meet my grandmother for another hour .
let &apos;s see . how far did you get ?
not far enough . that &apos;s my boss .
hey , what are you doing here ?
what you doing here ?
oh , my gosh . david o . russell . hi .
hi . i &apos;m david .
hi . i &apos;m serena . i &apos;m such a huge fan of your work .
thanks .
are you turning &quot; the beautiful and damned &quot; into a movie ?
well , i &apos;m trying to turn &quot; the beautiful and damned &quot; into a movie .
do you have the notes for the meeting ?
almost .
almost ? we gotta go .
i understand . i &apos;ve been working on them .
no , you &apos;re not . you &apos;re talking to a beautiful girl ,
which i understand , but--
&quot; beautiful things only grow to a certain height ,
and then they fail and fade off . &quot;
you read the book .
yeah , of course . i @-@ i read the book .
you read the book . she read the book .
i relate to it more than i should admit .
i got an idea .
we got the beautiful and the damned .
so this is not your assignment now . if you want a job ...
oh , my god . i can get this done .
well , she actually read the book , though .
what do you think ?
if you can prepare me for the meeting ...
oh , yeah .
hi .
how was the trip ?
it was long , but nice .
they &apos;re all in there . you can count ...
thank you , ivy .
you played your part perfectly .
well , thanks for hiring me .
i have to say it was ...
a pretty devious plan .
well , you met my family . you know where i get it from .
at least now they won &apos;t come looking for my daughter .
you gonna be all right going back to your real life
after having been a part of that world ?
i think i &apos;ll be fine .
good luck .
but if at the end , you find the person you &apos;ve become
is not the person you want to be ...
you can always turn around and try again .
and maybe the next time ,
you won &apos;t be so alone when it &apos;s over .
too late to turn back now .
