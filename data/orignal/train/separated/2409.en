My name is Elena Gilbert.
I'm a new vampire, and there have been complications.
I know that I'm sired to you, Damon.
You know what would make me happy?
That what you actually felt for me was real.
But there's hope now.
Jeremy's tattoo leads to a cure.
If you kill Klaus's brother Kol,
his entire sire line will die with them.
I was gonna make him suffer on my terms!
Unlikely alliances have formed.
Finding the cure could come at a price.
He's the world's first immortal being,
who just happens to be the person with the cure.
I want to free him.
But we finanlly have everything we need.
Here we go.
Congratulations.
We made it.
They couldn't have hidden this cure in Hawaii?
Where the hell did you take us?
200 miles off the Nova Scotia mainland.
If you recall, the whole point was to hide the cure
on the world's most obscure, desolate island.
Oh, yeah? I thought the whole point
was that no one found Silas,
The oldest, deadliest freak in the world.
Yeah, that too.
Sunscreen?
Is that a joke?
You're right.
You know your not really helping.
You're perfectly capable of tying a knot.
Your giving Elena the evil eye-- it's not really helping.
She killed my brother,
tried to get you to put a dagger in my back.
She's lucky all she's getting is the evil eye.
You know I can hear you, right?
You know I don't care, right?
Go ahead. Try and kill me.
But then you'd have to face your real problems--
like the fact that Stefan invited me here himself.
I guess he likes me again.
Looks like someone forgot her team-building exercises.
I'm not apologizing for not wanting her here.
You know, Stefan just brought her here
to make it seem like he's moving on.
He wants you to think that he's over you
and he wants me to think that I can't get under her skin.
You know, you're right.
With any luck,
I'll only have to tolerate her for a few more days
and then we'll find the cure
and I'll never have to deal with her again.
Human Rebekah.
Can't imagine her without fangs.
You know...
You've never talked about
what you'll do with the cure once we find it.
Will you take it?
I don't like to speculate.
Sorry. If there was a less awkward way to do this,
I would.
Doesn't bother me.
These symbols must have been left for the hunters
so they could find the cure,
and this must be the story of Qetsiyah and Silas.
According to Shane, Silas asked Qetsiyah for help
making a spell for immortality.
She helped make him immortal,
only to learn he planned to use the same spell on another woman,
not her
when she found out, she freaked.
So, Qetsiyah killed the other woman?
Yeah. Silas was immortal.
She couldn't kill him.
So, she trapped him in a cave and buried him alive instead.
Does it say anything about the hunter's purpose in all this?
I was wondering when you'd ask.
Qetsiyah created a cure for immortality
and then she buried it with Silas,
hoping that he'd take it and die.
End up on the other side with her for all eternity.
But he wouldn't give her the satisfaction.
So, many centuries later,
her descendants created the hunters
to find him, cure him, and kill him.
You know what? I'll explain on the hike.
Come on. We gotta get going.
Morning, sunshine.
You look pathetic.
Only until Bonnie's spell locking me in here wears off.
Then I'll look different.
Angrier, perhaps.
Or, I won't look like anything,
because I'll have gouged your eyeballs from their sockets.
My friends will be back with the cure by then.
So, I could shove it down your throat and make you mortal.
I'm an original.
What makes you think my entire vampire bloodline
won't be cured along with me?
I.E., you.
You know what I think?
I think that's impossible.
I think the moment you stop being a vampire,
our whole blood connection to you is broken,
and your sire-line ceases to exist.
So, whatever happens to you,
happens only to you,
which means I can kill your ass and no one else has to die.
Although I am still debating just how to do it.
I recommend drowning.
There's nothing quite like the feeling of
someone fighting for something as basic as human breath.
And let me tell you, your mother was a fighter.
Satellite phone lost its signal.
That's a good sign.
Is anyone else a little creeped out?
So, then leave.
Out of everyone, your presence is the least necessary.
Please don't start.
I'm merely stating the facts.
Jeremy has the spell on his body.
Bonnie's the witch that unseals the cure.
Shane is the human compass.
You and I have the tombstone, which does God knows what.
And Elena has no point.
What about me?
You have a nice behind.
Centuries after Qetsiyah died,
there were these miners who were excavating a well on the island.
Suddenly went mad.
Bled themselves dry. No apparent reason.
So, the legend spread that these miners,
in exchange for a drop of their blood,
saw visions of their lost loved ones in the well they were digging.
The word traveled
and explorers sought out the well to see if the legend was true.
So, the well was magic?
Yeah. Some people believe the voices of lost souls
were just a wind vortex whipping through caves.
And visions were caused by
inhaling the island's poisonous plant life.
And what do you believe?
I believe in magic.
My wife and my son died within months of each other.
And so...I decided to try the well out for myself.
I offered up my blood and waited.
Hello? Hello?
Atticus.
Caitlin. Caitlin? Caitlin?
Hello, Atty.
Caitlin.
I saw my wife.
I saw her eyes.
Her smile.
My blood let me see her again.
Yeah, got it.
Don't eat the poisonous flowers.
Wait. Stop. Stop! Stop.
Is everybody paying attention?
Our first lesson in survival.
Stay together. Keep your eyes open.
I'm out of water.
Here. Take mine.
Magic well? Seriously?
I don't know. I mean...
We've all lost someone.
The chance to maybe see them again?
I kinda get it.
Jeremy!
What the hell just happened?
Somebody just saved my life.
What is this place?
According to island lore,
a group of college kids came here for spring break.
A few weeks later, they were all found dead,
Completely drained of blood.
Well, tragic for them, brilliant for us.
Who sleeps where?
Well, that's lovely.
There's a mystery man with a hatchet lurking in the woods
And we're just gonna camp?
We're safer here than we are hiking in the dark.
Let's just keep going. You know?
Get the cure. Get in, get out.
Where is it?
How stupid do you think I am?
Stupid enough to raise an immortal witch,
so I'd say...incredibly.
Yeah, I'm shocked you even want the cure,
considering you've got the most to lose once Elena's human.
Shane doesn't know what he's talking about.
We'll find out tomorrow.
Do you really think I'm gonna take this cure,
break the sire bond, and fall out of love with you?
No. I'm saying we don't know.
And if we find it tomorrow, we will.
This cure is gonna change so many things.
Jeremy's not gonna want to kill me anymore.
We're finally gonna get rid of Klaus.
Bonnie's mom isn't gonna be a vampire.
And anyone who wants to take this cure is gonna have that option.
Caroline, Stefan, and you.
If you want it.
I get it. Everything changes tomorrow.
It'll be all unicorns and rainbows.
No, not everything. That's what I'm saying.
Damon, not my feelings for you.
You're still here? What are you doing?
Gloating.
Hello, Caroline.
Come home.
Don't stoop to his level.
He destroyed my life.
I plan on being present for every second of his misery
until I can kill him myself.
Fine. You can gloat and multitask.
This place is a disaster.
Starting with a horrific burnt corpse.
Tyler's mother is dead. So is my brother.
We're even.
Call Bonnie
and get her to let me out of here.
I will never, ever, help you.
How quickly you forget the part
where I saved Tyler from the misery of being a werewolf.
Or the night your mother invited me into her home
to save the life of her precious daughter.
How delusional are you?
You killed his mother.
And let's not forget that we're standing in a house
where Elena's aunt Jenna used to live.
Or did you think that your charm would make us forget
how you killed her, too?
You know what? No. I am not going to engage in this.
You are not even worth the calories I burn talking to you.
No!
Now, that was definitely worth the calories.
Well, 7 of us and no one thought to bring s'mores.
What are you doing with that?
We're a day away from finding the cure.
Not letting it out of my sight.
Do you hear that?
I swear this place is haunted.
Um...you're crushing my arm.
Ok. You got me. I'm a scaredy cat.
You do realize you're an original vampire, right?
Which is precisely why you should stop teasing me.
I'm very powerful.
What are you gonna do when Elena becomes human
and comes running back to you?
You said that you'd take the cure to be with her.
You'd have children and grow old.
Is it still true?
Why do you want to take it?
Aren't you the perfect vampire?
Isn't it obvious?
It's all an act, Stefan.
Being a vampire is miserable.
I would give anything to be human.
Normal.
If I take the cure... it wouldn't be for her.
It'd be for me.
I've been staring at pictures of Jeremy's tattoo
and there's no spell.
Expression doesn't require a written spell.
Just think of it as a way of
accessing magic that already exists inside you.
You just have to want it bad enough.
And I'm just supposed to trust you?
Bonnie, listen, I taught you expression
so that you could access the cure.
I'll be right there with you the whole time. Promise.
You didn't answer the trust part.
All right. Let me put it this way.
You need me to help you through it, Bonnie.
And as you've demonstrated, expression can get messy.
Believe me when I say I've seen it get a lot worse.
How much worse?
When we lost our son in the car accident, my wife kind of lost it.
She tried to resurrect his body using magic.
Your wife was a witch?
She was a powerful witch.
And incredibly undisciplined.
And you never thought to tell me?
I just didn't want to scare you.
The truth is, she tried to bring our son back using expression,
and it overwhelmed her, and she died.
You taught me the same magic that killed your wife?
Yeah, but look, the upside is,
I've learned the warning signs, all right?
I can keep expression from consuming you.
Downside is, you turned her into a bomb that only you can dismantle.
Don't you think I know how this ends?
I came here to raise Silas
so that he could bring back the dead,
but you're never gonna let that happen.
The second I point to a cure, you're gonna kill me.
Now Bonnie has to keep me alive
so that I can keep her alive.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Look at me. Look at me.
I can fix this.
How?
The only thing that can heal me is his blood.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
I know.
I'll fix it.
She'll die if you don't heal her.
Ok.
Beg me to save her life.
This is what you want?
To remind me that I'm powerless against you?
Fine. You win. I'm nothing.
Now, save her. Please.
I'm sorry, mate. I didn't quite catch that.
Please.
Please...
Please save her life.
See, now I think you're just telling me what I want to hear.
I mean, you did call me pathetic earlier.
And wouldn't it be more pathetic of me to help now,
knowing that hours ago,
you announced your plan to kill me
in a manner in which you're still debating
because you want it to have a certain amount of flair?
I'm just asking.
I'll be your slave again.
I'll do whatever you want.
Just help her.
No.
Get me out of here.
I can't even look at him.
Come on.
Jeremy!
Did you find anything?
He's not on the trail.
His gear's still here.
He's not at the quarry, either.
Split up.
I'm gonna stay and try a locator spell.
Ok. I'll stay here. I'll make sure she's safe.
I'll stay here and make sure you're not lying.
Fine. We'll keep searching the island.
Thought it didn't work.
Yeah. I'm just...just checking the signal.
So you can call someone?
Like whoever took Jeremy?
This place has a habit of getting to you, doesn't it?
See for yourself.
I'm done trusting you.
Uhh! Where's the cure?
You know that magical well I was telling you about?
Silas and the cure are buried deep below it.
So, you've seen it?
No.
But you could say I heard it from a reliable source.
Caitlin.
How is this happening?
You're bleeding.
What?
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
No. It's good. It's Ok.
It's what's keeping me here.
If a single drop of blood can give you a vision,
could you imagine what two liters could do?
What does your dead wife have to do with a cure?
She got nothing to do with a cure,
but she has everything to do with Silas.
I'm so sorry I let things get out of control.
I should've stopped you.
Sweetheart, it's ok.
You wanted Sam back as much as I did.
What if you had a second chance to bring us both back?
I can't, baby. I'm not a witch.
We have a witch.
His name is Silas.
If you set him free,
he'll help those who have helped him.
Set him free from...from what?
He's entombed in the caves below us,
but it's impossible to get him out without a spell.
You need to get the spell.
And that's when she explained everything that I had to do.
Complete the hunter's mark to access the spell
and empower a descendant of Qetsiyah to perform it.
Bonnie Bennett's related to this crazy-ass witch?
Jeremy!
Jeremy!
Why don't you yell louder?
Maybe we haven't drawn enough attention to ourselves already.
I'm sorry, and how are you helping?
I'm stronger than you and faster than you
and I'm quite certain I can charm the islanders a lot easier than you.
Not disagreeing on the easy part.
All right, we get it. You two hate each other.
Can we just keep going, please?
I tried being her friend,
but somehow, I ended up with a dagger in my back
because I'm the evil one.
Technically, you didn't achieve evil status until you killed me.
Nice catch.
Thank you.
No, actually, thank you.
This thing would've killed me.
I don't care what happens to you either way.
But if you're gonna die, it might as well be epic.
I'm gonna go back and check on Bonnie,
see if she found anything.
Be careful.
You have the rock, hunter, Bennett witch.
What about the dozens that died in sacrifice?
Where do they fit in to all this?
As you can imagine, that was not an easy pill to swallow.
Caitlin, it's me,
the guy who refused to serve a meat course at our wedding.
I can't--I can't orchestrate 3 massacres.
It isn't like that.
You're merely leading these people
so Silas can bring them back from the dead.
Why--why should they die just to be resurrected?
It doesn't make sense.
The spell that brings me back
requires a witch to channel
an extreme amount of mystical energy.
Energy that doesn't occur in nature.
Because it isn't natural.
I'm sorry, Cate.
I just--I can't do that to innocent people.
Can you feel my touch?
How is this possible?
Because you believe it is possible.
You believe that you can see me again.
You don't have to take a single human life yourself, Atticus.
All you have to do is convince someone
to believe that it is possible
that they can see a lost loved one again.
And they'll do it for you.
Which is how you manipulated the pastor
to blow up a farmhouse full of people.
He just wanted to see his wife again.
You need 3 massacres.
Fire at the Young farm.
Holiday hybrid slaughter.
What mass blood-letting am I forgetting?
You're not.
You're not finished.
Is that why you brought us all out here in the middle of nowhere?
Massacre number 3?
It doesn't work that way, Damon.
I think you need to tell me where this magical well is.
You know I can't do that.
Oh, I know.
I know.
It's getting worse.
I'm sorry.
No.
It's my fault. I'm sorry.
No. You didn't do any of this.
I unsired the hybrids
and turned them on Klaus.
I should've just left it alone.
You freed them, Tyler.
People put their faith in you because you're a leader.
Don't forget that.
Then you trust me?
You want to be in control, Klaus? Here.
Now you get to be in control of her life.
If you want her to die, fine.
But then you can sit here
and watch her die yourself.
Nothing personal, love.
If I cure you, that means victory for him.
Don't worry. It won't be long now.
Where's the cure?
Does it matter?
I think we both know you'd rather just torture me.
Torture gives you a sense of control,
especially with your relevance slipping away.
I look at you. Here you are,
hours from Elena breaking her sire bond.
Start to freak out a little bit.
Listen, you want my advice? Leave. Go.
Don't put yourself through this.
Oh! Fine. Ok.
Let's say her feelings for you are real.
How does that end?
She's human. You're a vampire.
Stop!
Mm. It's doomed, Damon.
See, you're not torturing me, man.
You're torturing yourself by helping them find the cure.
I could kill you.
Then no one would find it.
We've established that you can't kill me
without sending Bonnie off the deep end.
You can leave the island.
Then at least have a modicum of self-respect.
Don't stay here and watch Elena walk away from you.
Right.
Because if I'm not here,
then I can't get in between you
and whatever you're planning with Silas.
I'm not that easily manipulated, professor.
And there is one flaw in your logic.
I don't give a crap about Bonnie Bennett.
What is wrong with you?
What did you say to him?
Your boyfriend's a maniac, Elena.
Stop messing with my friends.
Shane is the only thing that's keeping Bonnie safe,
and you try to kill him?
And you wonder why Bonnie hates you.
I don't wonder, Elena, because I don't care.
I don't care about her.
I don't care about some lame-ass cure for vampires, either.
How can you say that right now?
Because I don't want you to be cured.
I'm not fighting with you about this anymore.
Being human isn't gonna change my feelings for you.
Fine. Say they're real.
Say you've become human and you still love me.
Then what?
You grow old. You die.
I stay a vampire.
Face reality, Elena. We don't work.
So, things aren't easy
and you're just gonna push me away now?
That's what you do, Damon.
You think that you don't--
you don't deserve something, so you ruin it.
I'm not gonna let you pull that this time.
Take the cure with me.
That's how much I know this is real.
That's how certain I am that
I'm going to love you
even after this is all over.
Take the cure.
Be human with me.
We can be together. Grow old together.
This doesn't have to be hard anymore.
That's not me, Elena. That's Stefan.
I used to miss being human.
Now I can't think of anything more miserable on earth.
Haven't we been through here before?
It all looks the same to me.
Thanks. But that wouldn't have killed me.
Sorry. Force of habit.
Don't be a tease.
Elena could be lurking somewhere in the woods.
Do you mean what you said?
About a cease-fire?
Why do you all assume that I hate Elena so much?
Well, I mean, you did run her off a bridge.
You all seem to forget that Elena's death
was the only way to save my family.
I did the same thing that every one of you would've done
to protect the people that you love.
And before you cast me as the bad guy,
maybe you should remember that Elena's helped to kill
not one but two of my brothers.
Maybe we're not as different as everyone's making us out to be.
Jeremy's not here. I'm going back.
Bonnie?
Where is everyone?
What are you talking about?
Bonnie is not here and Shane's stuff is all gone.
Oh, my God.
The tombstone's gone.
If you don't feed me your blood, I'll die.
Then you'll die,
and Tyler will have learned his lesson the hard way.
How could you do this to him?
To his mom? To me?
I'm a thousand years old. Call it boredom.
I don't believe you.
Fine. Then maybe it's because I'm pure evil,
And I can't help myself.
No.
It's because you were hurt.
Which means that there is a part of you that is human.
How could you possibly think that?
Because I've seen it.
Because...I've caught myself wishing
that I could forget all the horrible things that you've done.
But you can't. Can you?
I know that you're in love with me.
And anybody capable of love
is capable of being saved.
You're hallucinating.
I guess I'll never know.
Caroline.
Caroline.
What are you doing in my tent?
Where's the tombstone? What have you done with it?
What are you talking about?
Like it's not bloody obvious?
All you people ever do is betray me and here you go again.
Let her go. She didn't take it.
Was any of this real?
Was it just a ploy to distract me
while Shane ran off with the tombstone?
You think I would do that?
You think I would let some psychopath run off with the cure?
Every single moment of my last 146 years
has been ruled by the pain of being a vampire.
And this cure ends that.
It ends the guilt and it ends the suffering.
And you really think I would jeopardize that?
Fine. You didn't take it.
But that doesn't mean I trust her.
I didn't take it, but here.
Consider this a peace offering.
Don't you get it,Elena? There is no peace.
We're all screwed.
Exactly, Rebekah. We're screwed.
Bonnie's gone. Shane's got the tombstone.
Jeremy's missing
Who knows if Damon's coming back.
So,us 3 right here, This is all we've got.
So,we're either in this together...
or it's over.
For all of us.
Jeremy.
It's bit of a scare yesterday.
Thanks for fending off his attacker.
His attacker?
Jeremy was attacked by an islander.
I assume hatchet fling guardian angle.
No, it wasn't me.
Well, I guess there's somebody else on this island
who is desperate to keep our hunter alive.
How do I get here.
What the hell is going on?
I see your locater spell work.
The path behind me just...
Magically disappear. You'd thank the talented Masaque.
He's a witch.
Should you try to escape
we'll make sure you never find your way back.
So, gang's all here.
Silas awaits.
You got to be kidding me.
