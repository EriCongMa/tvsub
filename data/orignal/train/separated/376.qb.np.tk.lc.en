over 68 million americans
leave the safety of our borders every year .
if danger strikes ,
the fbi &apos;s international response team
is called into action .
gavin , come on .
these ladies are waiting on their photo .
okay , here we go .
ready ? smile .
hey . thank you so much for coming , you guys .
bye .
come again , okay ?
bye , hank ! thank you !
bye .
all right , ladies .
time to call it a night .
come on .
yo , what &apos;s up , hank ?
i need a beer .
i think i can help you with that .
but first , you up for hitting omar &apos;s tonight ?
yeah . i just need to go home and take a quick shower .
yeah , you do .
if i wasn &apos;t so tired , i &apos;d punch you right now .
go grab a cold one from the trunk
and stop complaining .
i said go grab a beer , not brew it from scratch !
what the hell ?
i can &apos;t breathe !
it burns !
what special honor brings you to my office ?
where &apos;s my octopus coffee mug ?
excuse me ?
unh @-@ unh . don &apos;t .
beth from carpool told me
she saw you take it from the kitchen .
have you asked yourself why you &apos;re listening to someone
whose glasses are thicker than old coke bottles ?
beth &apos;s stigmatism has no bearing on her veracity .
i think beth is just a little bitter
that someone didn &apos;t give her a call back
after the first date .
what ...
she had an indefensible position on moore &apos;s law .
semiconductor density is a super @-@ sexy topic .
with transistors approaching single @-@ atom width ,
moore &apos;s law is only relevant for --
she thought it was invented by roger moore .
and enforced by the 007 .
that does not preclude her having seen you
take my octopus cup of drinking .
except the fact that i don &apos;t drink coffee .
oh . good point .
hug it out ?
not necessary .
okay .
lan party -- wednesday , my crib .
of course . i &apos;ll bring the bean dip .
b.y.o.c. !
i don &apos;t drink coffee .
but i do enjoy a nice cup of tea .
jack , we need you and the rest of the i.r.t. at base asap .
where we off to this time , boss ?
cairo , egypt .
the land of pharaohs .
more recently , like the land of social unrest and instability .
let &apos;s catch everyone up , monty .
as @-@ salaam @-@ alaikum , agents .
okay , malik said , 25,
a first @-@ generation egyptian american ,
was found dead this morning on the outskirts of cairo
when an unsub threw this into his car .
chemical attacks -- brutal .
burns everything inside and out .
also causes trouble breathing , coughing up blood ,
and tissue necrosis before it kills you .
killing with gas as a murder weapon
is not only uncommon , it &apos;s also highly unpredictable .
the gas could be an indication
that our unsub wants his victims to suffer --
getting off on the visceral brutality
of watching them boil alive .
a true sadist .
so why malik ?
malik said was r.o.t.c. in college ,
served in the army for two years
till he tore up his knee and got an honorable discharge .
he moved to egypt to start a business .
so an ex @-@ military american killed in egypt
by a chemical attack ?
could be terrorism .
just last year , a wave of terror attacks
swept over egypt &apos;s northern sinai peninsula .
they used chemical gases and left many civilians dead .
yeah , those attacks were carried out
by a known islamic state affiliate
called the province of sinai ,
a known splinter group of the muslim brotherhood .
so , what was malik doing out there at that time of night ?
we think he was there to meet henry &quot; hank &quot; willis ,
a 25 @-@ year @-@ old american graduate student
from williamsport , pennsylvania ,
who , like nearly 600 other u.s. citizens
is currently studying in egypt .
hank was an employee at the camel shop
and clocked out just minutes before malik was killed .
where is hank now ?
in the wind -- local p.d. has had no luck
in trying to find him for questioning ,
but they did find his phone in the car , along with malik &apos;s .
they &apos;re sending over the data now .
what &apos;s malik and hank &apos;s connection ?
uh , undetermined .
they didn &apos;t go to work or school together ,
and they didn &apos;t share any social media friends .
hank &apos;s phone at the time he clocked out at work
puts him at the scene of the crime .
yeah , but if you &apos;re gonna kill somebody ,
you don &apos;t leave your phone behind .
unless you panic .
hank is a suspect ,
and we need to find him before the egyptian police do .
they &apos;ll shoot first and ask questions later .
well , hank could have run anywhere by now .
or moved on to his next victim .
help me !
help me !
help me !
help me !
help me !
第一季 第三集
&quot; listen to your convictions ,
even if they seem absurd to your reason . &quot;
egyptian proverb .
once we de @-@ plane , the deputy minister will confirm
our modus operandi while in cairo .
hey , jack .
seems the deputy minster &apos;s already decided to come aboard .
what &apos;s he doing ?
he &apos;s telling us it may be our plane ,
but it &apos;s his country .
welcome to cairo , agents .
unit chief jack garrett .
ssa &apos;s clara seger ,
matt simmons , and mae jarvis .
i &apos;m deputy minister akram sarkis , ahlaan .
deputy minister , we put in a request for weapons clearance .
i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s been denied , due to political recourse .
the fact - that an american student
also a former soldier - has been murdered in egypt
is already drawing international attention .
any perception that egypt &apos;s government
is being influenced by outside sources , particularly american ,
and tensions in the region could boil over .
of course . i understand .
in return , i &apos;d like to get some armed escorts .
that shouldn &apos;t be too hard .
any luck tracking down hank willis ?
negative .
he kept a low profile -- very few friends or co @-@ workers .
anything else that can help us moving forward ?
it seems that malik said
was not the first person to die by this m.o. in cairo .
a local resident , jabir ghannam ,
was gassed in his bedroom a few days ago .
why are we just learning about this now ?
we believed the man &apos;s death to be a suicide
and didn &apos;t make the connection
until we started to investigate malik &apos;s death .
it &apos;s a strange way to kill oneself .
what makes you think it &apos;s suicide ?
the victim was alone ,
and there was no forced entry into the apartment .
who found him ?
his wife .
she was at her parents &apos; house with their daughter ,
and when she returned to the apartment ,
she made the discovery .
we looked into her alibi . it checked out .
we &apos;d still like to have a chat with her .
of course .
clara and mae , you check in with jabir &apos;s widow ,
see what she has to say .
simmons and i will take a drive out to the crime scene .
then we &apos;ll regroup back here .
you are more than welcome
to use any of our facilities if need be .
well , thank you , deputy ,
but our resources are on the plane ,
and seeing as the airport is central to the rest of cairo ,
it makes sense to use this as base camp .
excuse me .
agents .
please .
give me something good , monty .
hank and malik &apos;s phones both had red phone applications on them .
red phone ?
point @-@ to @-@ point telephonic encryption
designed to protect callers
from having their communications intercepted .
the messages erase themselves both off the screen
and the server 90 seconds after being opened .
they wanted a secure line of communication between them .
so what were they trying to hide ?
maybe these guys are c.i.a.
should we give the company a call ?
if we want to wait six months for a definitive answer .
but , monty , why don &apos;t ...
... don &apos;t i bring the family in for an interview
and see what they know ?
yes . but if they were intelligence ,
they would have never told their families the truth .
let me see what i can fish out of them .
just remember ,
they &apos;ll have mundane cover stories ,
and the details won &apos;t add up .
we &apos;re so sorry for your loss .
i told the police that jabir wouldn &apos;t kill himself .
he loved his family too much .
but ... they would not listen .
we understand .
do you ?
are you two mothers ?
do you know how it feels to be alone in the world
and wonder how you will feed your child ?
i don &apos;t .
but i do want to find out who did this to your husband
and bring them to justice .
yeah , i would like to believe you ,
but nobody cares for the poor in this country .
we can help you .
did you or your husband know either of these men ?
did he have any arguments , disagreements ,
grievances with anyone of recent ?
have you walked down the streets of cairo ?
that &apos;s every day here .
did you husband have any outstanding debts
or business dealings gone wrong ?
no . jabir was sick for so long .
i pray now he has found peace .
sick how ?
he had headaches , coughed a lot .
how am i supposed to know ? i &apos;m not a doctor .
what did he do for a living ?
there are few jobs in cairo .
like most men , he went down to the barricades every morning .
the barricades ?
it &apos;s a wall in cairo where men go to find work ,
if you &apos;re picked .
mostly manual labor , but every little bit helps .
the day of his death , where were you and your child ?
i @-@ i told the police this already .
i was at my mother &apos;s house .
she &apos;s sick . i take care of her .
jabir was supposed to meet us , but he slept in .
is that your daughter ?
yes .
that &apos;s bishara . jabir took it .
is that jabir ?
yes . he had a beautiful eye .
your daughter -- where is she now ?
with her teta .
please . find the men who did this to my husband
and make them pay .
we have preserved everything ,
as you requested , agent garrett .
thank you , minister .
i &apos;d say we can rule out terrorism .
and how do you figure that ?
it &apos;s hard to spread fear from an isolated location .
no witnesses , no media coverage , no point .
terrorists like attention .
this place doesn &apos;t give them that .
but i can see why the unsub drew malik out here alone at night .
it &apos;s the perfect place to strike undetected .
yeah , the desert acts
as a natural - forensic countermeasure , too .
the sun , the sand , critters -- they remove trace evidence .
high winds cover up the rest .
if the unsub left anything behind , it &apos;s blown away .
so , let &apos;s walk through this .
malik drives up .
hank gets in .
we know this because his phone was found on the passenger side .
why does he then get out again ?
malik pops the trunk .
someone was thirsty .
what do you got , jack ?
sand covers , but it rarely sticks .
from the look of this blood splatter ,
someone was struck here , then they fell to the ground .
this was a blitz attack to incapacitate hank .
he &apos;s not our unsub . he &apos;s a victim .
mrs. said , i am sorry for your loss
and appreciate you coming in at this time .
if it helps catch the monster who did this to my son ,
then so be it .
now , can you tell me - what malik was doing in egypt ?
malik had been visiting cairo since he was young .
he had a special connection to the land .
that you left .
yes .
it &apos;s ironic .
you fight and claw to get out of someplace
to give your children a better life ,
and then they grow up and go right back
to the place you ran from .
what was malik &apos;s business in cairo ?
he had an export @-@ import business .
what kind of export @-@ import ?
egyptian spices .
i &apos;m brenda willis , hank &apos;s mom .
of course . i &apos;m russ montgomery ,
one of the agents working on your son &apos;s investigation .
any updates on hank ?
not yet .
but if i could please ask you to give us a mo ...
i am so sorry that we are meeting
under these circumstances .
i can &apos;t imagine what you &apos;re going through .
my thoughts and prayers are with you and your son malik .
thank you for your kind words .
i hope that your boy is found soon .
thank you .
since you &apos;re both here ...
one of the things - that we &apos;re trying to figure out
is how hank and malik knew one another .
i have no idea .
i &apos;m very close with malik . i speak to him all the time .
but he has never mentioned her son -- hank ?
mrs. willis , were you going to say something ?
what ?
no , i --
it &apos;s been a long couple of days .
i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sorry .
of course .
no worries .
mrs. said , i can reach you wherever it is you &apos;re staying
and give you updates as i receive them .
i cannot go until my son &apos;s body returns home .
then i will take him
and have him buried next to his father .
now , mrs. willis ,
if you &apos;ll come with me , i &apos;ll be able to fill you in
on the details - of your son &apos;s disappearance .
okay .
all right . mrs. willis , what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
i was just trying to protect her .
malik &apos;s mother doesn &apos;t know who her son really was .
but you do ?
yes .
look , i understand that there are
certain people &apos;s professional lives
that require them to live a lie .
and for some , that &apos;s true in their personal lives , too .
mrs. willis .
my son might be missing , but her boy is dead .
the last thing that woman needs is to be alone .
hey . how &apos;d it go ?
hank &apos;s not responsible for malik &apos;s death .
he was abducted .
any luck with jabir &apos;s widow ?
yeah , i mean , she &apos;s angry ,
but she &apos;s also grieving the loss of her husband .
yeah , she said that jabir was sick ,
but she wouldn &apos;t tell us how .
how could we expect her to tell us the truth
with the egyptian military standing right there ?
oh , speaking of ,
monty was able to get us jabir &apos;s medical records ,
and there have been several pages redacted ,
so there are things that they don &apos;t want us to know .
they might become a problem , jack .
that &apos;s why i suggested we use the plane as a base .
ever since the military coup , i &apos;m sure
everything the egyptians are offering is bugged .
well , not to mention we share very different views
about what democracy means .
we have had better luck looking into the gas
that was used on malik .
it is a lachrymatory agent .
it &apos;s similar to phenacyl chloride ,
which is a popular riot @-@ control gas .
it &apos;s banned by international convention ,
but it is used by the egyptian government .
the gas , when dispensed in large crowds ,
weakens as it spreads , causing only nausea .
but in a contained space ,
it &apos;ll kill you within two minutes .
so where did the unsub get his hands on
a government @-@ controlled gas ?
or did the unsub work for the government ?
hey , guys , i think i know
what hank and malik were really hiding .
they were in a relationship .
homosexuality is against the law
in almost all of the middle east .
punishable by arrest , whippings , even death .
well , under the al @-@ sisi regime , homosexuality is legal in egypt ,
but men suspected of being gay
are subject to arrest on charges of debauchery ,
and over 250 men have been arrested on related charges
in this last year alone .
well , it &apos;s only legal in name .
their basic freedoms are still in danger .
which is explains why malik and hank were using red phones
to send messages to one another .
and why they never had any pictures together .
this isn &apos;t a murder .
it &apos;s a hate crime .
where &apos;s malik ?
oh , no .
get that thing away from me .
you brought this onto yourself --
you and all your friends .
please .
oh , no , no , no , no .
no ! aah !
if hank is alive ,
we &apos;re running out of time to find and save him .
so if this is a hate crime , who &apos;s committing it ?
well , take your pick . we &apos;ve got a lot of options .
the arab spring puts - the muslim brotherhood in power ,
then two years later , they &apos;re totally taken out of it .
could be a fractured group that &apos;s still active .
or the current regime .
they legalized homosexuality
as a way to make nice to the west ,
but behind closed doors , they &apos;ve got a different agenda .
like appeasing fundamentalists .
what about the first victim -- jabir ?
does this mean he was gay ?
we could interview the wife again .
hey , guys , on malik &apos;s phone ,
i found some text messages .
i thought the red phone application erased all messages .
the messages do , but the senders don &apos;t .
the thing about the 256 @-@ bit cipher
is that it &apos;s designed to protect against
brute @-@ force attacks on consumer @-@ grade hardware .
it &apos;s not really intended to protect against
the unmitigated power of the national geospatial intelligence agency .
yeah , let &apos;s try that again in english .
okay .
there &apos;s a hidden list of contacts --
10 , to be exact .
now , the encryption is weak , so our computers can crack it ,
but the messages are gonna be a little harder .
tracking names down the good , old @-@ fashioned way
won &apos;t speed this up .
if i could just focus on one name ,
i could put all my efforts into that .
and i can probably get you their messages .
you said malik &apos;s mother was unaware of her son &apos;s lifestyle .
then maybe this is as simple as a process of elimination .
that rush you feel is the viper &apos;s poison
working its way through your system .
what do you want ?
answers to my questions .
why would i tell you anything ?
because if you do ...
i will give you the antidote .
sabah was his cousin , wahlaan , his landlord ,
and galila was his fiancee .
you sure of this ?
yes .
they took a break recently ,
but malik told us they would get back together soon .
who is omar ?
i &apos;ve never heard of omar .
or mahdoor .
they played soccer with mahdoor .
&quot; they &quot; who ?
i think what &apos;s important here is to focus on
finding brenda &apos;s son
and whoever did this to malik .
brenda .
you know my malik ?
then why didn &apos;t you say so earlier ?
because you &apos;ve been through a lot ,
and i didn &apos;t want to upset you .
about what ?
about malik -- and hank .
they were friends ?
they were in love .
shame on you -- to speak ill of the dead .
you were right , jack .
omar was the only name his mother did not know .
it seems omar has a moving party
for lgbt members in cairo .
you text him , and he texts you back
wherever the venue is that night .
smart way to keep - one step ahead of the local p.d.
it &apos;s malik and hank &apos;s m.o.
all right , i &apos;m sending you omar &apos;s work address now
and a photo to identify him .
good work , monty .
oh , one more thing .
one of the names on the list is supposedly malik &apos;s ex @-@ fiancee .
you got a name and address for her , too ?
on its way .
jack , why don &apos;t mae and i go ask the deputy for assistance
interviewing malik &apos;s fiancee ,
and then you and simmons can go talk to omar
without a babysitter ?
sounds like a plan .
khan el @-@ khalili market is the
original burial site for the fatimid dynasty ,
who founded cairo .
&quot; wow &quot; -- yeah .
that &apos;s exactly - what the ancient romans said
when they saw it around 100 a.d.
that &apos;s him .
if you &apos;re looking for copper , you &apos;re at the right place .
my prices are very fair .
i &apos;m looking for some information .
i enjoy america -- the kardashians and such --
but you will ask questions and go
while i must stay and deal with police .
all right , well , you have our word --
anything that &apos;s said between us will stay here .
ah . this is where i say &quot; why should i trust you ? &quot;
and then you will tell me because i have no choice .
yeah , something like that .
hurry , then -- before the police see us .
you know these guys ?
no . why should i ?
we know who you are and what you do , omar ,
and the sooner you give us the truth ,
the sooner we go away .
yes , that is hank and malik .
what about this guy ?
no .
you sure about that ?
look , our community is very small , very trustful .
that man is not a part of it .
what is this all about ?
we think someone &apos;s targeting gay men in cairo .
oh , that &apos;s nothing new .
so , what can you tell us about hank and malik ?
they took no guff from anybody .
what makes you say that ?
they got into a fight with some guy
during one of our last parties .
i had to kick him out .
who ?
look . we can &apos;t trust the police , so we police ourselves .
that man was a real homophobe .
so we took care of him ...
... and kept sure he never come back .
safar arabi .
it &apos;s safar . call me back .
who &apos;s the vic ?
uh , safar arabi . we thought he was a suspect .
what did the ex @-@ fiance say ?
uh , that she was being a good friend
acting as a beard for malik .
did monty check out safar ?
yeah . quite the rap sheet .
a lot of disturbing the peace , assaults .
huh . so he &apos;s a yapper and a scrapper .
what aren &apos;t we seeing here ?
we thought this was a hate crime ,
but by all accounts , both the first kill , jabir ,
and the latest , safar , were not of the gay community .
well , something is tying these two together .
question is , what ?
safar &apos;s bag .
hey , guys , take a look at this .
you can tell from their eyes --
that &apos;s safar ...
that &apos;s hank ...
i &apos;m pretty sure that &apos;s malik .
i don &apos;t see jabir anywhere .
how is he connected to all this ?
and what is that banner they &apos;re holding ?
&quot; the people want to take down the regime . &quot;
that &apos;s what the protesters chanted during the arab spring .
safar , hank , and malik were protesters .
which means someone is killing everyone in this picture .
i need another name .
who are you ?
you work for the government ?
answer me !
names , or you will hurt some more .
i gave you a name !
i need another !
i can &apos;t .
you will !
three of the four people in this picture
are either dead or missing .
there &apos;s only one person left .
so , why is the unsub targeting these men ?
we now know these aren &apos;t hate crimes .
it could be about the subversives .
which hank and malik definitely were ,
both as protesters and for being gay .
well , unfortunately , - safar &apos;s journal isn &apos;t much help
in identifying the group &apos;s members .
so far , the only ones i can make out are hank and malik ,
whom he refers to fondly , like brothers .
then why the blowout at the party ?
hank had started this pro @-@ democracy group with protesters
weeks before egypt &apos;s arab spring began .
he called them the khepers .
egyptian name for &quot; scarab . &quot;
only , safar was - the true brains and organizer behind the protests .
two young alpha males in a heightened situation .
hank was ready to start fighting for better gay rights in egypt .
but safar wasn &apos;t ?
well , not yet .
he felt like the group hadn &apos;t achieved their goals
from the arab spring , and to add yet another cause
would only make it that much harder .
it was a disagreement over their priorities .
hank and malik fought for the basic rights of the egyptian people
when their own freedoms were still in jeopardy .
and he could identify the others in the picture .
the unsub was using hank for information .
when the unsub gets it , hank is as good as dead .
hey , monty .
i &apos;m having no luck - with this facial recognition
of the last protester .
their face is covered ,
and the egyptian government is being less than cooperative
with the access to their records .
it &apos;s time for me to have a chat with the deputy minister .
has your team identified the last person in the picture ?
no .
but we aren &apos;t supposed to , are we ?
let me be blunt .
these are starting to feel like government @-@ sanctioned hits .
you think we &apos;re doing this ?
you tell me .
i can assure you that we &apos;re not behind any of this .
so it &apos;s just coincidence
that americans and subversives are dying on your watch .
maybe you and your team
have overstayed your welcome , agent garrett .
or maybe we &apos;re just getting closer to the truth .
and which truth is that ?
the one where you withhold information from us
about malik and hank &apos;s sexuality ?
i would have liked to have shared it ,
but i have concerns about your country &apos;s policies .
not the ones you march out to the world ,
but the ones behind closed doors .
you can &apos;t possibly condone this kind of abnormal behavior .
it doesn &apos;t matter what i believe or condone .
it &apos;s the law in both our countries .
it &apos;s our job to uphold it .
your government has records
on everything that happened during the arab spring .
i believe you know
who this last person in the picture is .
i can &apos;t say we do .
the last i checked ,
the u.s. is egypt &apos;s number @-@ one aid provider .
if you want it to stay that way ,
i suggest you get me what i &apos;m looking for .
are you threatening me ?
damn straight i am .
how &apos;d that go ?
not sure .
what &apos;d you say ?
i threatened that the u.s. would pull aid to egypt .
you can do that ?
you think i can ?
i don &apos;t know .
then it &apos;s working .
every other victim is accounted for except jabir .
what &apos;s he have to do with everyone in this picture ?
all those photos on jabir &apos;s wall .
he was a photographer . what if he took the picture ?
we need to go speak to his widow , neith , again .
neith &apos;s landlord said she left soon after we did
and hasn &apos;t returned since ,
but look what the police found under their mattress --
jabir &apos;s suicide note .
so he wasn &apos;t murdered .
apparently not , but why did neith tell us that he was ?
either she doesn &apos;t know
or it &apos;s a countermeasure to the truth .
what does jabir say in his letter ?
talks about how he has suffered for years from gas exposure
while shooting photography during the arab spring
for hank and the khepers .
seems jabir was the official cameraman
for hank and his crew .
and here &apos;s our modus operandi .
could be jabir &apos;s .
well , he may have bought them , but he only used one on himself .
look at the imprints in the dirt --
shows others are missing .
neith is our unsub .
and her husband &apos;s suicide was the trigger .
if she thought
had her husband never been involved with the protesters ,
he &apos;d still be alive .
but instead of going after the people who hurt him ,
she blames hank and his group for putting him in harm &apos;s way .
and she &apos;s using the same weapon that injured her husband
to go after her victims .
so the details are important to her .
the use of gas is symbolic .
trauma @-@ induced retribution seekers
are rarely indifferent to the specifics of their crimes .
if that &apos;s the case , then maybe neith is holding hank
in a location that was important to the group .
monty , i need you to show malik &apos;s mother that photo .
she may know where it was taken .
we believe that &apos;s where our unsub is holding hank .
thank you for coming back .
you said it was important .
it is , mrs. said . i need your help .
my son is dead . what else do you want from me ?
to help save someone else &apos;s son .
a son whose mother is a liar .
look , hank is still out there .
now , if you &apos;ll just take a look at this --
i won &apos;t ! i won &apos;t look at anything else !
you know , i spoke to brenda earlier ,
who told me about how hank and malik
came out to her farm last summer
and what a lovely time they had .
now , you may not be able to accept
hank and malik &apos;s relationship ...
but you can &apos;t deny it .
wait .
let me look at the picture .
do you know of malik &apos;s protest in the arab spring ?
proudly .
do you recognize - this location in the photo ?
that post .
it &apos;s an old archeological dig site near my family &apos;s home .
one year , malik , his sister , and i
tied a blue ribbon around that post
for my father , who passed away .
it was his favorite color .
thank you .
jack , hank is being held at an archaeological dig site
16 miles north of your current position .
hopefully , the unsub is there , too .
i &apos;m sending coordinates to the s.u.v. &apos; s nav now .
how are simmons and mae doing identifying the last target ?
well , your bluff worked .
the deputy minister i.d &apos;d the last person in the photo .
we located him in a mosque .
simmons and mae are on their way now .
help me !
somebody help me !
stop !
stop !
neith .
we can help you .
you cannot help me .
just like no one could help jabir .
he was an artist , until he met hank ,
who told him he could change the world with his pictures .
hank was only trying to help your husband .
instead , he doomed him .
jabir was following hank and his friends ,
when mubarak &apos;s thugs shot , stabbed , and gassed them ,
like they were nothing .
i know . i know .
what they did to - those protesters was horrible .
jabir was never the same .
always there ...
but never here .
and for what ?
arab spring was a failure .
all it brought was pain and suffering .
change takes time , neith .
there is no more time .
think about your daughter .
i am .
neith !
he was definitely held here . there &apos;s no doubt about it .
so where is hank now ?
maybe she already gassed him , like all the others .
then we &apos;d find his body .
hank wasn &apos;t just another protester .
it was his group .
he led them into danger .
well , he &apos;s the one neith sees responsible
for putting her husband in the ground .
we know she was impatient and sadistic .
that gas kills within minutes .
her husband suffered for years and then died .
there &apos;s no way - she &apos;d let hank off that easy .
she &apos;d want him to feel pain .
to feel lost and alone ,
like her husband did when he killed himself .
so ...
where do you hide something in the desert ?
you bury it .
she buried hank alive .
got it !
hang in there , hank !
hank !
if you can hear me , we &apos;re almost there !
we &apos;ve got you , son .
you &apos;re safe now .
let &apos;s get you home , son .
i appreciate your help .
you left me little choice .
i &apos;m sorry about that .
now it is i that don &apos;t believe you .
your country is in the beginning stages of your new democracy .
the u.s.a. has over 200 years ,
and we &apos;re still ironing out some things .
my baby .
thank you .
