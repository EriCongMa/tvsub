the commonwealth calls lesli stone .
even though alison was already locked up
her friends were all on edge
about anyone asking any questions .
do you remember everything that charles made you do ?
yeah , don &apos;t you ?
no , not really .
亲爱的儿子
he never left radley . he killed himself when he was 16 .
your brother might still be alive .
we go to radley .
i can &apos;t believe you went home .
i thought maybe once my mom got over
the shock of me being back , things would be different .
were they ?
no .
this is dean stavros .
spencer , i &apos;m a drug and alcohol abuse counselor .
help ! help !
i just needed to get some air and the door wouldn &apos;t open .
i &apos;m clark .
maybe you could sell me something
that would help calm my nerves .
yeah , what ?
pot .
sabrina made me some cookies .
whatever is bothering you , is still going to be there .
i can &apos;t sleep . my mind won &apos;t shut off .
i just want to quiet the noise .
hello ?
hello ?
wait , wait !
who are you ?
hold it . go back .
did you see his face in the dream ?
the word is nightmare .
and no , i didn &apos;t , that &apos;s when i fell off the bed .
so who was the little girl ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve never seen her before .
or maybe i have .
well , again , spencer , it was just a dream .
or nightmare .
well , what about that creepy room ?
i mean , do you remember ever seeing it--
i don &apos;t know , and if i did
i &apos;ve completely burned it from my brain .
listen , i should go .
wait , wait .
when we went back inside after a locked us out
do you remember a tiled room ?
it was right next to the--
spencer , i do not wanna--
aria , please , just help me .
i can &apos;t . seriously .
it @-@ it is taking all that i have to forget that place .
it is bad enough i can &apos;t even walk by the photo lab--
what did you do with that hair dye ?
huh , you &apos;re giving me cramps .
aria , we can &apos;t just throw away clues .
what &apos;re you eating ?
hello ? spencer , are you there ?
yeah . i &apos;m still here .
my mother &apos;s just sitting on my chest .
she &apos;s still on my case about this stupid valedictorian thing .
well , why don &apos;t you just say yes ?
because it &apos;s a pity toss , that &apos;s why .
i &apos;ve been gone for over a month .
she probably offered to buy them a planetarium .
just do it .
please ,
just give me a freaking reason to go to graduation .
oh , really ? now you wanna go to graduation ?
i thought your dad excused you
from ever having to step foot in school again .
oh , god . i have to run .
what just happened ?
my mom just back from curves
and i &apos;m not having this argument with her
after she pumped iron .
i &apos;ll call you later , okay ? bye .
god ! mona .
is this a bad time ?
when did you get back ?
late last night .
i just saw your mom as she was leaving for work .
she introduced me to that cop parked at your curb .
what &apos;s with the shades ?
is that cop really here 24 / 7 ?
yup .
and there &apos;s a bunch at school too .
they stand outside the bathroom while you pee .
i wish we &apos;d never come back here .
well , did you feel any safer at the spa ?
safer than i feel being in the same zip code as alison .
mona !
i sent her to jail , hanna . for months .
there &apos;s no way she &apos;s not plotting some kind of revenge .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re worried about ?
a is still out there .
you &apos;ve got bigger worries than alison .
yeah , i know , and when i leave here
i have to go straight to the police station .
they might still press charges against me
for being dead when i wasn &apos;t .
well , that &apos;s not a crime , that &apos;s just being stupid .
no , han , when there &apos;s a full @-@ on investigation
that costs the taxpayers more than our new sewer system ,
it &apos;s a crime .
and i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll have any cops looking out for me .
they &apos;re looking for a ! we all are .
even more reason for alison to wanna hurt me .
forget alison .
we have to track down anyone
who ever had any contact with charles dilaurentis .
someone who worked at radley has got to know something !
i &apos;m betting their father .
he &apos;s no help .
alison is so embarrassed .
she only leaves her house nowadays to go to church .
church ? alison ?
don &apos;t get all judge @-@ y .
she &apos;s just trying to move on . we all are .
well , will you at least drop me off
at the precinct before school ?
i can &apos;t go in there alone .
please ?
yeah . no , my shift started at 10 : 00 .
she hasn &apos;t left the house since yesterday ..
&apos; ... unless she dug a tunnel.&apos;
&apos;yeah , you know , with this little skank&apos;
&apos;i wouldn &apos;t be surprised , right ? &apos;
&apos;who &apos;s protecting us from her ? &apos;
&apos;yeah , seriously.&apos;
&apos;i mean , how many people has she put behind bars ? &apos;
&apos;i think they should chain her to the bed.&apos;
&apos;right.&apos;
&apos;yeah.&apos;
&apos;so are you running second shift tomorrow ? &apos;
&apos;i think so.&apos;
alright , well , see you then .
mom , i @-@ i can &apos;t talk to you when you &apos;re like this .
yes , you are . you &apos;re slurring your words .
i &apos;ll call you later .
hey , what do you say we go to the movies tonight ?
if my mom comes with us .
emily , i &apos;ve gotta go home .
why ? i thought you said your mom--
i did . but now she wants me back .
does she think that she can make some money
off of what happened to you ?
probably .
but i have to deal with her .
or you could stop dealing with her all together .
have you ever thought about getting legally emancipated ?
how did you know--
i &apos;m a psychic .
that or you told me you &apos;d be working in your dad &apos;s office today .
oh , right . what &apos;s up ?
well , i was looking over yesterday &apos;s photos
and i need to re @-@ think what i &apos;m shooting .
why ?
i mean my portfolio &apos;s starting to look like
one of those calendars the bank hands out for free .
i was thinking of taking a ride out to a junkyard on route 47 .
wanna come ?
uh ... no , no , i shouldn &apos;t .
i should stay here . i have a lotta work to do .
well , don &apos;t go into an early retirement , girl .
i wasn &apos;t blowing smoke . your stuff is good .
it &apos;s exactly the type of work they &apos;re looking for .
who &apos;s looking for ?
didn &apos;t we talk about the contest ?
mm , no . what @-@ what contest ?
the cardillo fellowship , it &apos;s a cash prize
and a summer internship at a magazine .
where ?
in la .
yeah , i know it ain &apos;t rosewood
but there are things worth photographing there too .
and you can do it in flip @-@ flops .
good luck with your work .
um , clark ?
can we just stop by my house , i need to grab my camera .
yeah .
why are you out here ?
i just needed some air .
if you &apos;re going stir @-@ crazy you can come with me to the office .
do your homework in the conference room
no one will bother you .
i &apos;m fine here .
i can always wear earplugs .
i overheard one of rosewood &apos;s finest
dissing me to another cop .
well , well ..
well , what ?
i &apos;d let it go .
kinda hard when someone &apos;s kicked you in the teeth
before you &apos;ve even brushed them .
alison , you have to own it .
bad behavior has a way of catching up with you .
you would know .
do you want a latte ?
i don &apos;t care , just order . hurry .
i thought you weren &apos;t in a rush to go to the police .
&apos;mona ? &apos;
lesli ? oh , my god .
what are you doing in rosewood ?
i was summoned by the police .
what ? why ?
what do you mean , why ? you made me an accomplice to a crime .
but you didn &apos;t do anything .
yes , i did .
i made the mistake of complimenting a stranger
on her dolce &amp; gabbana stretch pants .
&apos;and now , everything that i have worked for&apos;
my fellowship , my teaching position , my reputation
they &apos;re all in jeopardy
&apos;because i actually saw you as the victim.&apos;
you , you conniving little bitch !
whoa , easy . this is her first day home .
sorry , i forgot the champagne .
get a grip , lesli .
mona never made up that plan to hurt you .
really ?
you think i actually wanted perjury on my resume ?
i don &apos;t know what that means
but i really don &apos;t like your tone .
who gives a crap what you like , you bag of hair .
guys , stop .
lesli , i &apos;m sorry about all this , i swear .
i &apos;ll call you later--
don &apos;t .
if you ever try to reach out to me
or you mention my name to anyone ever again
and you will live to regret it .
i believe in payback too .
i mean , she acts like being questioned by the police
is the same thing mona &apos;s been through .
and then she turns it on me . me .
i &apos;m like , &quot; hello ! i should be biting your head off , freak .
you &apos;re the one who testified against me . &quot; am i wrong ?
okay , unless you &apos;re texting me the answer , you &apos;re rude .
wha .. i &apos;m sorry , um ... toby &apos;s not back &apos; til monday .
that &apos;s a really long time to wait .
wait for what ?
eww , why would you say that ?
i didn &apos;t say anything , i just smiled .
well , your cup may runneth over , but mine is bone dry .
eww , why ? did you and caleb have a fight ?
no , we don &apos;t even fight anymore .
he treats me like some cracked egg
that fell out of a robin &apos;s nest .
who &apos;s that ?
mona .
she &apos;s scared of alison and lesli stone now .
uh , just stay out of it .
hell no , lesli is a freaking lunatic
who needs a serious reality check .
mona was locked in a hole by someone who is still out there .
her friend should forgive her .
that &apos;s not staying out of it .
spencer , we can &apos;t have mona quaking in her boots
when we need that boot to kick the doors down at radley .
i mean , i &apos;m not going back to that shredding place
and mona knows radley more than any of us .
does she have any idea who could be posing as ali &apos;s dead brother ?
don &apos;t say dead .
charles isn &apos;t dead dead until we find something to prove it .
what is wrong with you ?
it &apos;s not your cookie .
okay , first you &apos;re sexting toby like some dog in heat
and then you &apos;re gumming at your dessert like my grandma .
how long do you want that cookie to last ?
we &apos;re not talking about me , okay ?
the subject is charles , and it &apos;s not gonna be easy
breaking into radley with or without mona .
are you buzzed ?
what ? no , hanna , focus .
you have the same look in your eyes
as this girl in my government class
who hums and makes chokers out of paper clips .
i &apos;m not humming , i &apos;m just .. i &apos;m missing toby .
well , dr. oz says sex is a drug too , spencer .
maybe you should figure that one out .
i like . are , uh , dolls your thing ?
no . actually , i find them pretty creepy
but , um ... it &apos;s this new thing i &apos;m trying .
embracing the creepy .
oh , i get it .
i , um , did this project last year , where i took vegetables
and did a photo progression as they rotted .
that sounds pretty cool . how &apos;d it turn out ?
i had a smelly apartment and a major fruit @-@ fly problem
but other than that it was okay .
what are you doing ?
sorry , uh , the shadow was across your face
and i just couldn &apos;t help myself .
in honor of us diving into things that scare us ..
... would you be up to having dinner with me tonight ?
clark , uh ..
that &apos;s a really nice offer , but i can &apos;t .
i &apos;m just .. i &apos;m not dating .
at least not for a while .
this past year has been really difficult
and without having ... to go into all the details--
no , i know .
i @-@ i recognized you . from the news .
i didn &apos;t wanna bring it up when we first met .
i figured it &apos;s probably hard enough for you .
i didn &apos;t wanna make you feel self @-@ conscious .
i apologize .
you don &apos;t have to .
what do you mean ?
uh , there &apos;s bike rides and lake activities
i mean there &apos;s even an overnight .
you &apos;re not scared of being in the woods after sundown , are you ?
no , i have been in the woods .
i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be going back
without a police escort .
they &apos;re watching me all the time .
they &apos;re watching out for you , alison .
you &apos;re not the person they &apos;re trying to catch .
look , if you don &apos;t wanna do it--
it &apos;s not that i don &apos;t want to . i just ..
do you remember the church , ali ?
i recommended you for this . no one gave any pushback .
seriously ?
well , there were a few people
who didn &apos;t say , &quot; yay , &quot; right away
but i took advantage of the silence .
i really believe you can make a difference with these kids .
hey , dad . uh , you remember lorenzo ?
hey there .
hello .
is this your idea of a replacement ?
thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop
you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age ?
that &apos;s not what i told you .
you claimed that cop insulted you .
he did .
whoa , wait .
who did ?
uh , you can leave now .
thank you .
why ?
the last time i checked , this was still my house .
goodbye , lorenzo .
okay , do you have anything that you might wanna put on a resume ?
any small job you had before , uh ..
i mean , i babysat for my neighbors &apos; kids .
that , uh , that may not be enough .
caleb , she was 14 when she ran away from home .
she &apos;s looking to be emancipated .
no one expects her to have started a hedge fund .
no , but they do expect her to have a job
where she can support herself and a high school diploma .
we should go .
no , wait .
caleb , you were able to do this .
yeah , and that &apos;s how i know it &apos;s not an easy process .
look , if you &apos;re only a couple of months away from turning 18
i would say just go home and wait it out--
no , she &apos;s not waiting it out .
she &apos;s lost enough time , every moment is precious .
what just happened ?
nothing . nothing . it was my fault .
okay .
i thought about blowing it off ..
but there are only so many family dinners you can skip .
so i went .
and the questions started .
i told everyone i lost my job
and i was actively looking for another .
i came so close to raiding my sister &apos;s medicine chest .
then i realized ..
i &apos;d already delivered the bad news .
nobody blinked .
putting it out there right away ..
it helped .
uh , i &apos;m dean and i &apos;m an addict .
hi , dean .
i just got back from a family event myself .
my older brother &apos;s wedding .
i have a lot of the same issues that sheldon has .
some old grudges and some new ones .
i could feel everybody wondering if i was high .
expecting me to be the same person
that showed up to anything without a buzz on .
excuse me .
the refreshments are for after the meeting .
sorry .
okay , i may have gone a little overboard .
i &apos;ve got over eight rolls in here .
well , here , i &apos;ll help hang &apos; em up . gimme a couple .
thank you .
aria . you wanna wait &apos; til they dry ?
you &apos;re making me nervous .
no , they look great .
where are you goin &apos; ?
i just have to make a quick phone call .
aria ?
clark may have taken a picture of a.
whoa , slow down . who &apos;s clark ?
&apos;the guy that i met in the hollis photo lab.&apos;
we @-@ we went to a junkyard to take some pictures
and i &apos;m pretty sure that a followed us there .
and clark got a on camera ?
by accident , but i @-@ i can &apos;t examine the negatives
without looking like a freak , so maybe i should just tell him
what &apos;s going on and that way--
no ! don &apos;t .
aria , if you say anything
sarah &apos;s gonna be the one who gets targeted .
i &apos;m the one that &apos;s being followed .
i left rosewood for an hour and a was all over it .
why don &apos;t you just print the photos out
and we &apos;ll look at them .
they &apos;re not mine , em .
so , borrow them . okay ?
clark &apos;s not gonna miss them for one night .
i gotta go .
everything okay ?
yeah , it &apos;s all good .
okay . where were we ?
i can &apos;t fake havin &apos; a job .
what if they wanna call my boss ?
give them my number .
what are you gonna say ?
that she works for me at my web design company .
you &apos;re willing to cover for her ?
it &apos;s not a cover . it &apos;s minimum wage .
you start tomorrow .
hey , lesli , it &apos;s hanna again .
i &apos;m wondering if you ... got my message
or if you just don &apos;t wanna meet , but ..
never mind .
look , before we do this , can i just say one thing ?
sure .
i &apos;m sorry .
i was way outta line this morning .
you are not the source of my anger .
clearly , you got more screwed over by that mona stunt
than i did , and if you found a way to forgive her--
i have .
and it would be great if you could too .
that ... may not happen overnight .
mona &apos;s complicated . okay ?
but she is not the real monster here .
that person hasn &apos;t been caught yet .
maybe you &apos;re right ..
but i still can &apos;t help but wonder if that ..
radley place helped mona or made her worse .
well , she &apos;s not the only one .
what does that mean ?
that nut house may have closed down
but it still holds all the answers .
answers to what ?
i thought the police ... ask the questions .
taking matters into your own hands is exactly what got
your friend mona into trouble in the first place .
ready to hit the road ?
yup . actually ...
now i can &apos;t remember if i dumped out
the last of the solution .
hang tight , i &apos;ll check .
okay ?
alright .
we &apos;re all good .
are you sure you don &apos;t wanna come in ?
mmm , pass .
the last time i saw that gate
your mother was tossing my duffle bag through it .
aiming for my head .
well , she &apos;s mellowed out a bit since then .
oh , i doubt it .
uh , if your family did mellow
i wouldn &apos;t be driving you home right now .
look , i haven &apos;t been to a meeting in a while .
and it was just for some reassurance .
i thought it was the free food .
i &apos;m just really tired of living
in a state of permanent anxiety .
if a few bites of a cookie can get me through my day
and help me sleep--
it doesn &apos;t work like that . you can &apos;t rationalize .
uh , you &apos;re either in or you &apos;re out .
i know , i know .
but when you &apos;ve been yanked out of one nightmare
and then shoved into another--
you &apos;re right . it sucks .
yeah , but you &apos;re strong , spencer ..
stronger than you think .
please ... just don &apos;t say that .
why ? why don &apos;t you believe that ?
i gave something to you a long time ago and you never used it .
my number .
maybe next time you can &apos;t sleep or ..
thank you .
can you do me a favor ?
yeah .
can you throw that out ?
you &apos;re the first girl to toss her cookies in my car .
thank you .
mona ? is that you ?
hi .
hi .
what are you doing ?
it &apos;s a card for alison .
i know it &apos;s totally retro , but e @-@ mails can be deleted
and she would never take my calls , so ..
you look great , spencer .
much better than the last time i saw you .
i was on a hospital gurney .
yeah , me too , but you looked more graceful being rolled .
mona ... can i ask you something ?
you were in that dollhouse longer than any of us .
so do you think that it &apos;s possible
or could there be a chance
that there was another girl that was trapped down there ?
not sara harvey , but a @-@ a younger girl
maybe 11 or 12 .
why are you asking me this ?
i @-@ i @-@ i have this image in my head of a young girl .
she looks a lot like a young alison and she &apos;s ..
guiding me towards this creepy room
with these rusted bathtubs .
i think that everyone that was trapped
in that place escaped , spencer .
okay , but what about that room ? have you ever seen it ?
it &apos;s got a couple of drains on the floor
and the walls are tiled , there &apos;s broken furniture everywhere
and god knows what horrible things happened down there .
no . i haven &apos;t seen it , but ..
it sounds terrifying .
it is .
maybe it doesn &apos;t exist .
i just .. i felt like i had been in there before .
i think it must live in your head .
right .
goodnight .
goodnight .
so ? how &apos;d it go ?
she said it would take a while for my pfe to go through , but ..
that i could stay with you and your mom in the meantime .
that &apos;s amazing .
okay , we have to do something special tonight .
how do you want to celebrate your freedom ?
let &apos;s make it permanent .
we &apos;re not leaving here
until we find something about charles .
god , what did they keep down here ?
or should i say who ?
patient records .
only the staff was allowed in the basement , not us .
i guarantee mona &apos;s been down here .
yeah , where is she ?
i thought she was supposed to be our tour guide .
she wanted to come , but her mom &apos;s attached at the hip .
they , like , shower together .
god , why are all these doors locked ?
spence , what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
wait , that door &apos;s open .
that &apos;s how i know this place .
what ?
it was in radley , not the dollhouse .
i &apos;ve been here before .
i know this room .
well , then , why am i the only one doing anything ?
can you help me ? this is heavy .
thanks .
okay , once it dries
put this cream on it every day .
every day .
that looks amazing , i love it .
your turn .
what ? no .
come on . i saw you eyeing that mermaid with the harpoon .
and if my mom ever found out i got a tattoo , she &apos;d harpoon me .
so get a small one . in a place she &apos;ll never see .
what does this one mean ?
that is the japanese symbol for courage .
it &apos;s got your name on it .
no , but it could . have a seat .
could you hold my phone ?
where do you want it ?
maybe right ... here .
it &apos;s just really tender .
well , it ain &apos;t gonna hurt any less with a needle in it .
how about something a little closer to the good china ?
un @-@ friggin &apos; -believable .
radley has files on patients who &apos;ve been dead
since the stone age but nothing from six stupid years ago ?
stop . i found it .
c. dilaurentis . i got it .
what &apos;s it say ?
spencer , talk to me . is he dead or not ?
yeah , he &apos;s dead .
what am i looking at ?
it &apos;s a work order .
the courier who transported his organs .
so what ? that doesn &apos;t mean squat .
hanna , you can &apos;t donate your heart , liver and both kidneys
and still play boggle in the radley rec room , he &apos;s dead .
well , someone is pretending to be him , so who is it ?
who is charles ?
i don &apos;t know .
this is just a bunch of medical files .
what are you doing ?
oh , my god . is that a kneecap ?
don &apos;t touch it .
why would i touch it ?
spencer , where are you going ?
if you leave me alone here , i--
just shut up . i &apos;m just getting something to fish it out .
fish it out ? i don &apos;t wanna see what it &apos;s connected to .
spencer . spencer , stop . please , stop .
breathe , breathe , it &apos;s a doll .
what ?
it &apos;s a resusci anne .
well , w @-@ w @-@ what @-@ what is that ? like a @-@ a blowup thingy ?
no , you blow into it , they use it to teach cpr .
what was that ?
it &apos;s probably something you woke out of hibernation
with your screaming .
i totally could have dropped this off at church .
why make you leave your house if you don &apos;t have to ?
because i want to ... leave .
i don &apos;t even know how to apologize for him .
that was so wrong .
alison , your father &apos;s not angry with me .
or you .
he &apos;s angry with himself .
he failed to protect his own family and ..
that &apos;s gotta hurt .
well , it wouldn &apos;t hurt us as much if he &apos;d just admit it .
hey , did you notice who was on site today ?
at the curb ?
i got the goon who was on your beat
to trade shifts with another officer .
her name &apos;s lydia . she &apos;s nice .
you &apos;ll like her .
you didn &apos;t have to do that .
i wanted to .
we should probably call my mom , let her know we &apos;re on our way .
sara , what &apos;s wrong ?
i read the text you got .
from aria .
what text ?
i saw her too .
i &apos;ve seen her a couple times .
when we went to caleb &apos;s apartment ..
... there was someone across the street in a black hoodie .
okay , sara , let &apos;s not do this here , okay ?
we &apos;ll talk about it when we get home .
we &apos;ll be okay .
sara . sara , wait !
spencer , come on . like , could we just go ?
i don &apos;t need any more proof he &apos;s dead .
we knew that already , but we don &apos;t know
who charles was close to , who he hung out with .
we &apos;re never gonna know that .
radley doesn &apos;t put out a yearbook .
let &apos;s go .
okay , that was definitely not an animal .
i &apos;m leaving here now .
sara .
please , don &apos;t do this .
you &apos;ve been looking all along , haven &apos;t you ?
what ?
for whoever had us down in that bunker .
why didn &apos;t you want me to know ?
sara , we &apos;ve been trying to protect you , okay ?
i &apos;ve been trying to protect you .
i need to protect myself .
i thought we were connecting . how could you keep this from me ?
i had to . a threatened to hurt you if we told the police
what we found in that dollhouse .
i don &apos;t understand .
sara , we &apos;re getting closer to figuring out
who this person is .
soon , we &apos;ll know--
oh , my god !
come on !
what the hell , mona ?
have you been down here the whole time ?
was that you ?
answer us !
just let me go .
please , i &apos;ll explain later .
no , you &apos;re gonna explain right now .
why were you following us ?
she didn &apos;t want us to find this .
just give it back to me , okay ?
this doesn &apos;t have anything to do with you guys .
why were you stealing your file , mona ?
she wasn &apos;t .
she was stealing lesli stone &apos;s .
wait , what ? lesli was a patient here too ?
yes , and she doesn &apos;t want it to go public .
is that how you met her ?
lesli stone was in radley . when ?
judging from this , a long time .
long enough to know mona and charles .
马上过来 有进展
i &apos;ve got to go to hanna &apos;s .
why ?
she &apos;s having a rough night .
she wants her friends around her .
does she ?
and will lorenzo be there to comfort her too ?
i &apos;ve gotta go .
you are not going anywhere .
and if you keep this up , i will take you far away from here .
i mean it .
what ?
you gonna bury me at aunt carol &apos;s farm too ?
shove me in the ground right next to charles ?
what are you talking about ?
am i crazy ? that &apos;s a girl , right ?
that &apos;s a bust and it &apos;s leslie stone &apos;s .
hanna , stop . we barely know anything about that girl .
i mean , taking us down in a courtroom is not the same
as taking us down to that bunker .
aria &apos;s right . i mean , why ? why would she torture us ?
because she &apos;s unstable , that &apos;s why .
that girl &apos;s got bigger mood swings than that ..
captain hook ride at hershey park .
and you forgot to mention that she once shared a room
at radley with bethany young .
what ?
they were roommates
and probably pretty close .
lesli must think that we helped ali kill bethany that night
and then dumped her body in that pit .
your sister did that .
no .
melissa just ... buried her alive .
we still have no idea who bashed her over the head
and lesli doesn &apos;t know any of it .
she probably thinks that alison did the deed
and we helped her get rid of the body .
but why hide behind charles &apos;s name ?
maybe she was just as close to charles as she was to bethany .
it all comes back to charles .
so was mona covering for lesli ?
i mean , by stealing her file .
mona said she was doing it to repair their friendship .
lesli &apos;s got her fooled too .
or not .
what about sara ?
i mean , why would lesli stone go after a complete stranger ?
it was probably just a rehearsal , em .
until she could get her hands on the real alison .
okay , so what do we do now ?
well , we know where she lives .
i say we catch her in the act .
how ?
i did everything i could , lesli , i swear .
mona , what are you trying to say ?
they know .
what ? you &apos;re kidding . dammit ! dammit ! dammit !
i asked you to do one thing , mona , one freaking thing
and you screwed it up . you screwed it up for me !
