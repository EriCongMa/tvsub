pameron tucker , you outdid yourself
on these biscuits and gravy .
they are so tasty ,
they make you want to slap your mama .
am i right , mitchell ?
sure . if that &apos;s a thing , why not ?
bless your hearts .
i &apos;m fuller than a dog tick .
hey , just because they do it ...
it &apos;s the least i could do ,
since you &apos;uns opened your home to me
for i don &apos;t know how many weeks now .
three .
i just don &apos;t get it .
how could he leave me ?
i know .
i &apos;m pretty .
there &apos;s nothing i won &apos;t let him do in the b @-@ e @-@ d .
hey , sweetheart , you &apos;re such a big eater , aren &apos;t ya , huh ?
i can &apos;t believe i got left .
left !
so , pam got left .
her husband , bo , took off with half their stuff
when she was out rounding up dazed piglets after a twister .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i insisted she stay with us
so i could help build up her confidence again .
pam &apos;s self @-@ worth has always been
tied to the attention of men .
which , you know ,
maybe isn &apos;t the best thing for lily to witness .
what are you talking about ?
n @-@ nothing .
i &apos;m probably just imagining it .
i &apos;m not imagining it .
it could be him !
that could be him , you guys ! it could be him !
get !
that could be him ! it could be him !
it &apos;s not him .
wow , this is more reading than i did
in my three years at a two @-@ year college .
i &apos;m thinking chili dog ,
just like pops -- may he rest in peace --
bought me at my first baseball game .
may i be frank ?
we have a wiener .
oh , that &apos;s so weirdly sweet .
and it &apos;s so cute how your hair never moves .
it &apos;s like a lego .
hey , i know you !
coachella , dancing on top of my van .
no , i just have one of those faces that --
it &apos;s haley , right ?
haley , would you like to introduce us ?
um , okay .
andy , my boyfriend , this is ...
tom .
tom .
tom tom .
is that cherokee ?
i should -- - bye .
i &apos;m sorry .
hey , i know that you &apos;re a little wilder than i am .
it &apos;s one of the reasons i fell for you . it &apos;s exciting .
you don &apos;t have to say that .
no , i mean it .
you know what ? let &apos;s forget about dinner and a movie .
let &apos;s do what wild haley would do instead .
honestly , i &apos;ve been kind of ready
for wild haley to chuck her party pumps in the trash .
or give them to charity , blah , blah , blah -- whatever .
but if that &apos;s one of the things that andy liked about me ,
i wasn &apos;t gonna shut it down .
okay , well , we can start
at this western place where i know the bartender .
if you hang back , i can get us free drinks all night .
it won &apos;t look weird ,
you ordering two drinks every time you go up ?
no .
then let &apos;s turn this mother out .
i got pretty lucky
pulling that expression out of my fanny .
i &apos;m not usually so quick with party talk ,
but i &apos;ve always had this fear
that haley would think i couldn &apos;t keep up with her ,
so i just tried to survive the night
and not barf on my dad &apos;s old church shirt .
claire ?
claire ?
claire ?
can we watch the movie now ?
honey ?
answer him !
honey , please . i just have to approve this proposal .
i &apos;ve been working on it all week .
oh ... my ... god .
that &apos;s right . sun never sets on mama &apos;s empire .
no , remember the travel app we signed up for
that gives you the last @-@ minute deals ?
three nights in paris , first @-@ class airfare ,
four @-@ star hotel for basically nothing .
the flight leaves at noon tomorrow .
we have five minutes to answer .
wait . you &apos;re not seriously considering this , are you ?
it &apos;s kind of the deal of the century .
plus , we &apos;d only miss one day of work .
haley &apos;s with andy . luke &apos;s on a ski trip .
i don &apos;t matter .
oh , sweetie , by the time we got there ,
we would be so messed up on the time change ,
we would just wander around in , like , a nauseous fog .
or you could just force yourselves
to stay up all night tonight ,
then sleep on the plane tomorrow ,
and then when you land in paris ,
your morning will be paris &apos; morning .
there we go !
lucky for us , the smart one &apos;s home .
it &apos;s such a sweet idea ,
but i am so tired from work this week .
what is more energizing than springtime in paris ?
baguettes baking , mimes miming , skunks in love .
this is what life is .
c &apos;est la vie , right ?
nope .
joie de vivre .
better .
look , someday , watching movies on the couch
is the only thing we &apos;ll be able to do ,
but right now , let &apos;s fire a warning shot
right through father time &apos;s beard
and spend a weekend in the eternal city .
rome .
emerald city .
seattle or oz .
she knows where i mean , and the clock &apos;s running !
you really want to do this , don &apos;t you ?
we &apos;d be back tuesday with the story of a lifetime .
press the orange square .
pressez @-@ vous le square orange .
yeah ! we &apos;re doing it !
sorry , sleep ! you &apos;ll have to wait !
we &apos;re setting our watches to paris time ,
which is ...
nine hours ahead .
okay . okay , it &apos;s 9 : 30 right now ...
oh , my god ! 6 : 30 .
6 : 30 .
how long &apos;s it take to get the makeup off ?
i got out of saigon faster .
you like what walks out the door every morning ,
so don &apos;t complain about the process .
i got a floor sander in the garage
if it &apos;ll open up the bathroom sooner .
aw , feeling a little put @-@ out , jay ?
it &apos;s my bathroom , remember ?
manny , there &apos;s no pimple there .
it &apos;s the underground kind . i can feel my heartbeat in it .
i retired . i needed a little project .
so i decided to redo our master bathroom .
yeah , if only someone had told you
that it was going to be harder and longer
than it looked on youtube .
oh , wait !
if you just followed the simple bathroom schedule
i posted in two places in english and spanish ...
yes , who does that ?
who puts a schedule up for their family ?
uh , don &apos;t go in there .
i need to get my vanishing cream . i can &apos;t find it .
must &apos;ve worked .
so funny , i forgot to --
what happened to the shower ? !
it was finished !
i started over . i wasn &apos;t loving the grout .
this is gonna take at least one more week .
don &apos;t upset yourself .
no , you are upsetting myself !
and you &apos;re gonna go and sleep on the couch .
are you serious ?
fine .
what are you doing ?
that &apos;s fresh tar in there .
you really want to smell that all night long ?
i get to make one decision about this bathroom .
the door stays open !
fine .
um , in all the bathroom confusion ,
instead of my multivitamin ,
i may have taken a birth @-@ control pill .
i think you &apos;ll be fine .
and anyways , for sure i won &apos;t be needing one tonight !
it may be the pill ,
but i &apos;m feeling a little attacked right now .
did you drink that while it was still on fire ?
it &apos;s an old habit .
it &apos;s how i used to eat my marshmallows .
i love this guy .
and you &apos;re so pretty .
it &apos;s really good meeting you two .
haley , i &apos;ll give you 20 bucks to make out with bianca .
20 bucks ?
so , bianca &apos;s a smoker . didn &apos;t love that .
or the wandering hands .
but it &apos;s all a part of the wild haley experience .
god !
no !
12 seconds ! not bad !
and it was so fun .
that &apos;s why i was screaming .
wow , what a night , huh ?
sucks it &apos;s so late .
not where we &apos;re going .
i know that look -- vegas !
come on ! you in ?
turtle @-@ y !
i love this idea .
me too ! i was scared we were done .
let &apos;s go .
that &apos;s some tender meats .
i can &apos;t sleep when i &apos;m angry . never could .
and there &apos;s something very wrong with people who can .
what are you doing sending e @-@ mails this time of night ?
really ?
you want some company ?
gloria &apos;s just adjusting to me being around more .
we &apos;re on top of each other -- and not in a good way .
oh , fun . i was hoping your sex life would come up .
look , dad , remodels are tense .
half the divorces i do start with a remodel .
or an underwear model .
can i get you anything ?
you know what a reuben is ?
yes .
no , you don &apos;t .
this is a reuben .
you grill the bread and the corned beef separately .
now , i said &quot; corned beef . &quot;
there &apos;s no vodka in a martini .
there &apos;s no pastrami in a reuben .
you put &apos; em together .
then you have &apos; kraut , swiss , russian .
axis , neutral , ally .
that &apos;s how you remember .
got it . roderigo ! number siete !
what &apos;s with people today ?
yeah , it &apos;s totally people .
look , dad , you get so worked up .
you should try doing this thing that i &apos;m doing
where i just decide not to let things bother me .
really ? - yep .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here alone in the middle of the night ?
it &apos;s just a little hard
to get work done at my house right now .
so , once a year ,
some sort of pollen is released into the air ,
and for two weeks , cam has allergy @-@ induced sleep apnea
and has to use an apparatus in order to help him breathe .
is it hideous ?
is what hideous ?
i barely even noticed it .
what &apos;s challenging is , pam has the same condition .
i thought that maybe i could focus
if i could get those contraptions in sync .
why did you plug it back in ?
charming .
no , unlike you , i didn &apos;t engage , and i avoided a fight .
so all is well on my side of the street .
mitchell , there &apos;s a pile of little orange hairs
on your keyboard .
you &apos;re picking your eyebrows again .
like you did when i put you in little league .
okay , i am a little stressed .
but it &apos;s just &apos; cause i &apos;m -- i &apos;m buried under work .
and cam &apos;s sister is the worst influence on lily .
but i @-@ i can &apos;t yell at her because she &apos;s a sopping mess .
so , you know , who am i supposed to yell at ?
my husband , who needs a machine to breathe ?
well , you better find yourself an outlet .
that &apos;s why i have scotch and golf and cigars .
otherwise , i &apos;d be a raging jackass .
we &apos;re out of rye .
then bake some !
can you please not yell at the woman
who &apos;s bringing us our food ?
i -- our food -- stop that . that &apos;s gross !
it &apos;s like a fox ran across the table .
we &apos;re out of here .
no , i have work to do .
no , you got to blow off some steam .
o @-@ okay , this sounds a lot like little league .
we better not be going to a batting cage .
you do not want to put a bat in my hands right now .
like you could hit me .
let &apos;s go .
out of that trance ! we &apos;re going to france !
i can yawn . it &apos;s 2 : 30 in the morning .
mais non , mademoiselle ! it &apos;s 11 : 30 in the morning .
thanks for doing these .
yeah .
did i mention that -- - yes , you did --
that if you wear your sweatpants low enough ,
tonight , i will see london , i will see france ,
and then , yes , i will see your underpants .
phil !
you &apos;re asleep !
oh , no , no , no !
it &apos;s fine . we can take a nap .
europeans are always napping .
actually , that &apos;s the worst thing you can do .
she &apos;s right , claire . get up .
why are you still awake ?
i &apos;m too excited to sleep .
i &apos;m studying big bang nucleosynthesis --
well , more specifically
the total baryonic matter in the universe .
let &apos;s go back .
dark matter and dark energy
make up 95 % of all of the matter in the --
no ! go away !
stop !
we needed help .
and no surprise , first entry on howtostayawake.net --
coffee .
this did it .
this is all we needed .
you want to rub my feet ?
if you rub mine .
phil !
the feet ! why &apos;d we do the feet ? !
second tip -- stay active .
you &apos;re asleep !
finally , we found something that worked .
for me .
no ! what the hell ? !
oh , my nana !
what do you say we take a walk and get something to eat ?
it is french lunchtime .
sure . it &apos;s worth a shot .
got to do something first .
why ? !
why would you do that ? !
alls i &apos;m saying is ,
if you &apos;re lucky enough to get this boy ryan you like ,
you hold on with both hands .
&apos;cause once he &apos;s gone , you &apos;re nothing .
okay , you don &apos;t really mean that .
i don &apos;t know what i mean .
i &apos;m just a woman running her fool mouth off .
okay , not exactly the message of empowerment
we &apos;d like to impart to our 21st @-@ century daughter .
what &apos;s a demerol shooter ?
okay , you know what ? let &apos;s keep our voices down .
we don &apos;t want anyone woken up and proven correct .
give me that .
one more drag !
no . stop .
what &apos;s the worst it &apos;s gonna do ? kill me ?
stop ... it !
hey , i rolled that !
mama !
mama !
mama !
what ? !
sorry , sorry . it &apos;s you , papi .
what &apos;s wrong ?
can you please deal with joe ?
and also get a therapist ?
mama !
that is not coming from his bedroom .
mama !
oh , no !
i wanted a glass of water , and i got stuck .
damn it !
why didn &apos;t i close that door so you didn &apos;t get stuck
like manny &apos;s gerbil in the glue trap ? !
but you said he ran away .
yes , most of him did .
take off your slippers .
oh , yeah , good idea .
don &apos;t want anything bad to happen to them .
okay .
wait ! what are you doing ? !
are you crazy ? ! they &apos;re florentine leather !
ay , manny , that &apos;s what we just told you .
we got them in chinatown .
okay , little joe .
let &apos;s get you out of there .
okay , come on !
okay . ay .
now we &apos;re gonna burn these pajamas
with the towel and the slippers .
burn them ?
it &apos;s in my hair , too .
okay . i will cut it .
go . grab some scissors and run them back to mama .
i &apos;ll get the scissors , joe !
i didn &apos;t even want him ,
and i &apos;m the only one keeping him alive .
okay , i just have to smooth this out
so that jay doesn &apos;t notice anything .
you &apos;re really going through
a lot of trouble to hide this from him .
you just don &apos;t understand .
this is the first time in a fight
that i was 100 % right and jay was 100 % wrong .
that never happens .
and being right is so important ?
get married and then get back to me .
ay , no ! this is stuck ! come help me !
push !
oh , no ! my birthday rolex !
ay , manny .
we &apos;ll take the check , please .
no !
thank you so much .
i want to go to sleep so bad , phil .
maybe this will keep you awake .
our house cannot be this far .
we &apos;ve been walking for ...
we &apos;ve passed this mattress already .
it &apos;s fate .
god wants me to sleep .
fight it ! fight it , claire !
let me go !
no ! no ! we &apos;re so close !
i can &apos;t let you quit !
oh , god . i &apos;m not gonna go to sleep on some filthy mattress ...
okay .
for long .
no . no !
no , no . i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so tired from work already .
i won &apos;t be any fun in paris .
you should go .
meet someone . i don &apos;t care .
i just can &apos;t do it . i &apos;m sorry .
you know what ? let &apos;s not .
i shouldn &apos;t have pushed you .
i know i said all that stuff about not wanting to get old ,
but ...
i think i really wanted to go because i miss you .
because i &apos;ve been working so much ?
yeah , which is great .
i @-@ i really want that for you .
i @-@ i think i ...
i just wanted a little adventure .
but you know what ?
we &apos;ve had so much fun tonight .
when was the last time
i got to stay up until 5 : 00 in the morning with you ?
give me that hand .
what for ?
that &apos;s to wake me up .
and that is for ever forgetting
that you are the best husband .
oh . what &apos;s that for ?
for whatever &apos;s crawling all over me !
oh , no ! they &apos;re on me , too !
$ 40 for the hour . songs are in the book .
anyone want a cocktail ?
you know how to make a manhattan ?
yes .
no , you don &apos;t . the only manhattan --
he &apos;s got it , dad .
thank you . thanks .
so , a karaoke bar , huh ?
you know , it &apos;s a little offensive that you think
singing a pop song is gonna solve my problems .
how gay do you think i am ?
mitchell !
madonna !
oh ! yeah . okay .
well , come on !
when you were stressed out as a kid ,
you used to dance and sing madonna in the living room .
fixed you right up .
ah , i &apos;m not surprised .
you think i haven &apos;t changed at all in 25 years .
if you were surprised , i wouldn &apos;t know it ,
since you &apos;ve plucked out all your eyebrows .
madonna , mitchell .
news flash -- i am not singing .
news flash -- yes , you are !
you know what , dad ?
you have been really bossy tonight .
with me , with that waitress .
i @-@ i bet that &apos;s why you and gloria are having problems .
yeah .
you miss bossing people around at work ,
so now you &apos;re doing it at home .
if i admitted there was some truth in that ,
could you just give in ?
you &apos;ve been grinding around like lola falana .
i don &apos;t know why this is so important to you .
can you just let me help you ? !
okay , i &apos;m doing this ,
but only because you need it so much .
come on , girls !
do you believe in love ?
&apos;cause i got something to say about it .
and it goes something like this .
* don &apos;t go for second best , baby *
* put your love to the test *
* you know , you know ... *
watching mitchell , i did feel kind of good
about fixing his problem .
now , being retired , you don &apos;t always feel useful anymore .
it &apos;s probably why i keep tearing up that bathroom .
i guess it wouldn &apos;t be the worst thing to admit to gloria .
eh , it &apos;ll probably blow over .
* express yourself *
damn it .
* express yourself *
i knew you &apos;d be up , tossing and turning .
yes , yes .
why are you calling from the couch ?
not home . long story .
look , let me get this out .
i have been going crazy with the bathroom ,
but it &apos;s not really about the bathroom .
it &apos;s about me not being sure who i am anymore .
you were 100 % right .
i love to hear that , but ...
no , you were .
okay . no rush getting home .
we &apos;re fine here .
please , please , please ! come on , black !
18 red .
18 red .
so close .
gambling is the best !
you hand your hard @-@ earned money to strangers
and pray it comes back .
i know i &apos;ve had a lot to drink ,
but that is not bianca anymore , is it ?
nope .
i don &apos;t want to believe clint sold her ...
you guys want to get really crazy ?
people know where i am .
all @-@ in on one number .
okay , i guess that &apos;s no scarier
than when that glow @-@ stick broke in my mouth .
do it .
andy , that &apos;s , like , a month &apos;s rent .
hey , you got to go big or ...
wait -- the black ones aren &apos;t $ 1s ?
really ? okay , could i just ...
sorry , sir . the ball &apos;s rolling .
oh , my gosh .
andy , what is happening with you ?
why are you doing this ?
what are you talking about ? i thought you loved wild andy .
no , no .
i love normal andy ,
tomato @-@ soup @-@ and @-@ grilled @-@ cheese andy .
still @-@ in @-@ bed @-@ by @-@ 11 : 00 andy .
uses @-@ the @-@ word- &quot; tummy &quot; andy .
really ? because i &apos;ve been doing this whole thing
because i was afraid you &apos;d get bored and dump me
if i couldn &apos;t keep up .
i know you can &apos;t keep up . but i &apos;d rather slow down .
i like the me i am when i &apos;m with you .
well , i wish you would have told me that about a minute ago .
i can &apos;t watch !
the stress is murder on my tummy .
aunt pam &apos;s leaving .
pameron jessica tucker , where do you think you &apos;re going ?
home -- to get down on my knees and beg bo to come back .
i &apos;m just gonna lie and tell him i &apos;m pregnant .
no , that is not how mature people handle their problems .
i will fight you .
you are not going to crawl back to that man .
you don &apos;t have a choice . you know i can take you .
oh , yeah , right .
pameron -- no !
okay , you know what ?
you are going to regret that !
oh , now you poked the bear !
well , come on , mama bear !
i &apos;m coming !
it &apos;s all my fault anyway !
i pushed him away !
because i never listened !
you really want lily to think women are weak ? !
get off my daddy !
you &apos;re acting this crazy all over a boy ? !
oh , lily , i &apos;m so happy to hear you say that !
now , pull aunt pameron &apos;s bra strap !
okay . so we moved the couch .
where were you ?
i , uh , i had some work to do .
me too . get my man back .
okay . okay . all right .
as much as i &apos;d love to leave this alone ,
i learned something tonight
that i feel like i @-@ i need to share with you .
you deserve the best in life .
so if the time isn &apos;t right , then ... move on .
second best , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s never enough .
you &apos;ll do much better , baby , on your own .
baby .
on your own .
my god .
you &apos;re right .
yeah .
don &apos;t go for second best .
put your love ...
it &apos;s okay . i fixed her .
madonna fixed her .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ve got this .
take all the time you need .
i &apos;m only finishing a 12 @-@ hour shift .
do you got a nickel or a dime or anything ?
i don &apos;t .
sorry , but ...
you &apos;re gonna have to make change .

my mom and dad are going to paris .
okay , children informed , passports secured ,
luggage packed .
