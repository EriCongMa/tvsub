oh , hey .
you ready ?
i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
everyone feels like that the first few times you eat here .
it &apos;s like heroin . it makes you sick ,
and you think , &quot; i &apos;ll never do that again , &quot;
and here we are .
no , we put our project on kickstarter ,
and we &apos;re getting major funding right now .
and i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
kickstarter-- that &apos;s the website
where strangers give money for crap
that no one in the real world would invest in , right ?
exactly , but our project isn &apos;t crap .
it &apos;s bananas .
we design candles with arms .
i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
don &apos;t you have a passion project--
something you &apos;ve always wanted to do ?
yeah , you can &apos;t just want to be a waitress your whole life .
actually ...
i do have a kickstarter idea .
i &apos;d like to start kicking your asses !
you know we work for tips , right ?
yeah . this one got away from me .
okay , listen up , it &apos;s tuesday ,
and like martin luther king , i have a dream .
tonight you will do side work .
hold up , girl . i have ten minutes till my shift starts .
max , that is not appropriate .
i &apos;m your boss . don &apos;t call me &quot; girl &quot;
yes , ma &apos;am .
okay , you want to play ? i &apos;ll play .
hey , sir . hey , big manny man .
why don &apos;t you show me your penis ?
han , you know i don &apos;t have a penis .
it &apos;s the only thing we have in common .
where &apos;s caroline ?
in the back at our cupcake shop .
why you don &apos;t open your walk @-@ up window
till you close here at night ?
she &apos;s getting a jump on our side work .
what ? we can &apos;t do ours and yours .
relax , marjorie .
keep it up , max ,
and one day i will show you my penis .
and you &apos;ll be sorry .
yes . yes , i will .
that &apos;s it ! new rule !
no more making fun of the boss !
han doesn &apos;t want us calling him names anymore .
it &apos;s like , if you don &apos;t want to be called names ,
don &apos;t look like that .
why is the window open ? what is all that ?
it &apos;s me , if i had lived .
oh , my god . did you see that rack ?
see it ? i have to carry it around all day .
i &apos;ve been wearing the same clothes
every day for two years .
now , i know that &apos;s your dream scenario ,
but to me , it &apos;s a horror show .
go get new clothes .
just go to the place around the corner
and buy some cheap ones .
max , they sell clothes by the pound .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s called the fashion pound ,
and that is why it is awesome .
look , i &apos;m willing to cut a lot of other things ,
including my wrists ,
but i need quality clothes .
the only reason i &apos;ve been able to wear these pants every day
is because they &apos;re quality .
well , that and a lot of febreze ,
which reminds me ...
i used to smell like money .
now i smell like pennies .
and , max , you need a hit .
&apos;breze me .
hi , girls .
did you see the high @-@ fashion model shoot ?
i was too short to be a model in poland .
well , i guess you can &apos;t have it all , right ?
do i smell febreze ?
that &apos;s my second @-@ favorite scent .
oh , and there &apos;s my first @-@ favorite scent .
hey , sophie .
i &apos;m sorry . have we met ?
i &apos;m not good with faces that i never want to see again .
what happened ?
i thought you guys were gonna be friends .
yeah , messed @-@ up , passive @-@ aggressive friends
who occasionally sleep together ,
like ryan seacrest and simon cowell .
oh , okay , i see what you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;re pretending like we don &apos;t have
movie @-@ character names for our private parts .
well , good @-@ bye , miss ,
and give my regards to mrs. doubtfire .
okay , e.t. , go home !
here &apos;s your mail , girls .
max , sophie had a new purse .
everybody has something new .
even the homeless lady on the bus had a new barrette ,
and even though her feet were split open ,
i still felt jealous .
oh , this is not a bill .
now , that &apos;s a first .
&quot; we are offering you a new phone ,
as older flip @-@ model phones such as yours have been degraded . &quot;
they &apos;re slut @-@ shaming phones now ?
i don &apos;t want a new anything .
and i like my old flip .
where &apos;s my damn letter from the pants company ,
saying , &quot; girl , those things are tired--
here &apos;s a new pair for free &quot; ?
if you want something for free ,
why don &apos;t you just go on kickstarter like everyone else ?
you can &apos;t use it for clothes .
can you ?
and if you can , can i ?
why not ? it &apos;s no stupider than candle arms .
now , if the candles had real arms
and could slap the idiots who bought them ,
i &apos;d invest in that .
max , we have nothing ,
and if anybody is giving us something for free ,
we &apos;re taking it .
you are getting that free phone ,
and i am begging for free clothes .
things are looking up .
you might want to kickstart some underwear .
well , obviously , they don &apos;t have anything .
let &apos;s go .
max , stop . my pants just ripped some more .
i have to fix them again .
hey , quality , why don &apos;t you just take them
to office depot and get them tailored ?
let &apos;s shop .
uh @-@ oh , they &apos;re ripping again .
i feel a breeze up in my febreze .
how can i help you ?
oh , hey . hi , uh , chiandra .
where can i get a new flip phone ?
mm , let me think .
guatemala .
i &apos;ll miss you , phone .
this is breaking my heart .
come on , boo .
it &apos;s a phone , not bruno mars .
now , i need that letter .
oh , here it is . i have it .
it &apos;s in my purse .
what &apos;s her story ?
why is her hand on her ass ?
her staples popped .
lap band ?
happened to my cousin .
she had a diet 7 up and exploded .
then she got m.s.
according to judge joe brown ,
it was not related .
uh , here , i &apos;ll just take this one .
slow down , now . take a look around .
you got a whole world of possibilities .
pick &apos; em up , get a feel ,
hold it in your hand for a while .
chiandra , it &apos;s a phone , not bruno mars .
oh , &quot; texting is easy
with the new finger friendly keyboard . &quot;
my fingers are already too friendly .
ask my fourth @-@ grade boyfriend .
these sample texts are getting kind of racy .
&quot; bad news--i think the condom broke last night . &quot;
why would anyone put that on a display model ?
that &apos;s mine .
i left it there by accident .
but that &apos;s not your problem .
now , tell me , what are your phone needs ?
uh , my needs are simple .
i need a phone that can draw a mustache on people
and occasionally will call my mother and hang up .
and she needs one with a good camera ,
because i have to film my video pitch for new pants .
i have a hole in my butt .
you know you &apos;re supposed to , right ?
max , i might be a virgin again .
i love my new phone !
it &apos;s so cool and red .
it feels like anything could happen !
but it probably won &apos;t .
my first call .
what do i do ? what do i do ?
oh . hello ?
oh , hey , girl , good for you . bye .
chiandra &apos;s not pregnant .
max , why are you taking calls from chiandra ?
we have to do my video .
i had to take her call .
she gave me a bunch of free apps--
angry birds , doodle jump .
if you want to look like a dog , i could do that .
look , here &apos;s me as a st. bernard .
有着脖子上装着小酒桶的救难圣伯纳犬
see my neck keg ?
okay , i &apos;ve done some research ,
and here &apos;s some things other people want money for .
one woman wants money for a new leg .
scrolling .
wait . if she only has one leg ,
shouldn &apos;t she be on can &apos;t @-@ kickstarter ?
oh , i &apos;m no longer working with them .
they denied my project .
apparently , i &apos;m not artsy enough
and have too many legs .
so now i &apos;m on go fund yourself .
oh , perfect .
i &apos;ve been telling you to go fund yourself for years .
the future of my pants hinges on the video pitch .
the tone needs to be sad and pathetic .
uh , preparation done .
what &apos;s sadder than former billionaire caroline channing
asking for money for pants ?
oh , they &apos;re not gonna know it &apos;s me .
are you being funded by al @-@ qaeda ?
if they &apos;re buying , i &apos;m taking .
and action .
hi . i can &apos;t tell you my name ,
and i can &apos;t show you my face because i &apos;m too ashamed .
sadly , i find myself in a situation
where i am no longer able to provide myself
with the garments i need in order to be the best
in my day @-@ to @-@ day life .
i &apos;m aware that this is not a problem for everybody .
stop , stop ! i need to take a picture of myself
having the most fun i &apos;ve ever had .
your nose is coming out of your eyehole .
no .
no , no , no , max , don &apos;t stop .
i &apos;m in a groove .
no , you &apos;re in a bag .
please let me take a picture of you in a bag
and then turn it into a dog
and then call it a doggie bag .
go , max , i &apos;m running out of oxygen ,
and i think there was cheese in here .
and action .
if i achieve my goal--
specifically , a new pair of quality pants--
then i promise i will give back to the community ,
wearing said pants .
all i need is $ 1,500 .
stop ! whoa ! $ 1,500 ?
how many pounds of clothes are you getting ?
look , it &apos;s for one pair
of amazing dries van noten silk brocade pants--
super cute .
and , yes , it &apos;s a lot ,
but my investors will get something in return .
for $ 5 , they will get
the feeling of goodwill in their heart .
pbbt !
for $ 10 , i &apos;ll send them a selfie
in the new pants that they bought .
for $ 20 , i &apos;ll send them a selfie without pants .
nobody is gonna give you money for the stuff you offered .
&quot; goodwill in their hearts &quot; ?
this is the internet . we &apos;re animals .
you &apos;re right .
i have an idea .
camera up .
and action .
i &apos;m sure a lot of you are probably thinking ,
&quot; look at this spoiled , indulgent , clueless girl . &quot;
well , i am .
and you &apos;re also probably thinking ,
&quot; god , i want to slap her . &quot;
well , guess what . you can !
for $ 500 , you can come here
and slap my spoiled , clueless face .
and cut .
pretty good , huh ?
genius . now , here , take the camera .
i want to film my video to raise $ 500 to slap you .
earl , look !
i just got 20 more dollars from one of my backers !
now , let me get this straight .
you just ask people for money ,
and they give it to you--
without using a weapon ?
well , earl , i guess desperation cuts like a knife .
man , being white is easy .
um , we &apos;re ready to order .
caroline , i just unlocked the candy hammer .
棒棒糖铁锤是可以用来敲碎某一糖果的道具
can you go over there and take those girls &apos; orders ?
i can &apos;t . i just can &apos;t .
oh , no way ! i just hit $ 1,000 !
that &apos;s almost both legs paid for !
uh , hello ?
you &apos;re dinging and donging right in front of my face .
can &apos;t you at least put your phones on vibrate ?
i don &apos;t like to mix business with pleasure .
you two need to be off your phones and working .
now . and no back talk .
totally .
totally .
totally .
totally .
oh , i know what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;re group @-@ texting insults about me !
we are not .
i got your text !
han does look like those minion things in despicable me !
and i thought bullying would end when i hit four feet .
oh ! oh , my god !
i &apos;m getting my new pants !
i just got a $ 500 pledge !
somebody wants to slap me ! somebody wants to slap me !
just one person ?
hey , han insists we can &apos;t leave tonight
without doing our side work ,
so i made him into a chihuahua wearing a diaper .
check your phone .
caroline ?
someone got some new pants !
* when a fire starts to burn , right *
* and it starts to spread *
* she gonna bring that attitude home *
* don &apos;t wanna do nothing , what they like *
* when a fire starts to burn , right *
i wasn &apos;t finished !
no , i was .
max , i didn &apos;t want to tell you this ,
but i was secretly worried my booty was gone .
turns out , it was just the pants .
it &apos;s still there . take a picture of it .
okay , let me see .
perfect !
now , let &apos;s send a group @-@ text to our diner family ,
and i &apos;d like you to copy me on that ,
because i want to send it to my dad in prison .
he &apos;ll be so proud .
yeah , &apos; cause i &apos;m sure he &apos;s not seeing any asses there .
you know what i love about these pants ?
how they make my butt look--
can you see it through the window ?
i got new pants .
hey , earl , you got my text , right ?
you mean that picture of caroline in her pants
that said , &quot; i &apos;m so sick of her &quot; ?
i know , right ?
if she ever gets a new shirt , just kill me .
i hear you , max , but i just can &apos;t believe
you included her on the text .
yeah . what ?
oh , my god . i didn &apos;t take her off the chain .
i mean , if you &apos;re gonna trash a child ,
you got to take her off the chain .
look , earl , they &apos;re here !
look what your $ 10 is buying you !
uh @-@ uh , not looking . don &apos;t want to know .
i &apos;m taking myself off the chain .
uh , hey , caroline .
uh , did you get my text ?
not yet .
the front of the diner is a bad reception area .
uh , no , no , no , no .
don &apos;t reach for that .
it &apos;s probably just an amber alert .
通过商业广播或交通信号灯等向社会大众传播的一种警戒通知
why are you acting weird ?
oh , are you jealous of my new pants ?
no , but i may have texted something about you
that i didn &apos;t mean ,
so just please don &apos;t look at your phone .
uh , okay .
if it &apos;s something bad , i don &apos;t want to see it anyway .
she &apos;s gonna look at it , isn &apos;t she , earl ?
i would .
she just did .
you &apos;re so sick of me ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s funny !
&quot; i &apos;m so sick of you &quot;
you know , said funny .
you know how i am . ask earl .
earl , help .
oh , i am off the chain .
oleg , help .
i &apos;ll be in my car .
oh , look , look ! here &apos;s han !
he knows how i &apos;m always just joking .
han , nod your head and don &apos;t ask why .
oh , no , last time you asked me to do that ,
i wound up on a date with an albino .
and who didn &apos;t call who back ?
i don &apos;t know how they &apos;re so confident .
max , you said you were sick of me .
oh , why are you so upset ?
i say worse things to you all the time .
yesterday i said you were sad and pathetic .
but that was to my face .
i can &apos;t believe you talk about me behind my back .
it &apos;s bad . i am sorry .
what can i do ?
hit me . punch me .
tell my mother where i live .
congratulations , max .
now you &apos;re like all my old girlfriends ,
talking behind my back .
stop looking at that . delete it .
this is not what i think .
i &apos;m not sick of you .
really ?
&apos;cause when i see it in writing , it feels like you are .
it &apos;s not me . it &apos;s this phone .
it brought out the ugliness that was kind of already there .
there !
i killed it because it hurt you .
i swear i didn &apos;t mean it .
you have to believe me .
it &apos;s fine , max .
i feel like i &apos;m gonna throw up .
there ... i french @-@ fried my phone .
what else can i do ?
i mean , really , it is technology &apos;s fault .
it &apos;s turning us against each other .
caroline , i swear , i will never accidentally say
anything about you again that i never meant .
i have to get ready for work . it &apos;s fine .
stop saying that .
please stop saying it &apos;s fine .
&quot; fine &quot; doesn &apos;t mean fine .
the scale goes great , good , okay ,
not okay , i hate you , fine .
if &quot; fine &quot; meant fine , that &apos;d be great ,
but it doesn &apos;t , okay ?
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s not fine .
it sucks . i &apos;m hurt .
you &apos;re the one person i care most about .
no , you are the one person i care the most about .
well , right now it doesn &apos;t feel that way .
it has to feel that way !
you are my best friend , caroline !
i love you .
oh , my god , now i &apos;m really gonna throw up .
max , is that the first time you said &quot; i love you &quot; ?
don &apos;t look at me . i &apos;m embarrassed .
now what do we do ?
so you &apos;re not sick of me ?
you are the only person in the entire world
i am not sick of .
caroline ...
there &apos;s a woman here who said she paid to slap you .
if i had known it was an option ,
i would have thrown my name into that hat .
well , time to put this on .
that &apos;s my $ 500 pledge .
i &apos;ll go .
what ?
i &apos;ll take it . i deserve it .
you &apos;ve already gotten a slap in the face from me .
but she &apos;s expecting to see me .
no , she &apos;s expecting to see a clueless woman
wearing a paper bag .
and even though i wasn &apos;t planning
on becoming that woman for another 20 , 25 years ,
i owe you .
seriously ? you &apos;re not gonna stop me ?
nope .
and , max ...
i love you too .
i &apos;m so sick of you .
