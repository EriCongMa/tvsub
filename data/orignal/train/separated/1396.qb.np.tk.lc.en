what &apos;s the best first @-@ person shooter
about genetically modified space marines ?
halo !
honey ,
have you been playing your new little video game all day ?
when you say it in that tone , it implies that luke and i
haven &apos;t been spending quality time together .
which we have .
can i talk to him ?
sure thing . luke !
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s here .
i mean , i @-@ i know he &apos;s not here .
where is he ?
i am certain he is probably out with his usual crew of cut @-@ ups .
you &apos;re not doing laundry , are you ?
god , no . but i &apos;m about to if i &apos;m supposed to .
no , no . don &apos;t . don &apos;t .
but can you vacuum out
the dryer vent before i get home ?
i will absolutely do that .
thanks .
i can &apos;t get in touch with haley .
i haven &apos;t talked to her since we got in that fight .
she around ?
i think she slept at a friend &apos;s house .
what friend ?
not a normal name ,
starts with a vowel , possibly foreign .
oh , maybe alex knows . is she home ?
nope . i have not seen her for hours .
does haley know an arjibarge ?
hi , mom .
hi , honey . where are you ?
i &apos;m in the kitchen .
alex ? when &apos;d you get home ?
i &apos;ve been here all day .
you should get outside , get some fresh air .
it &apos;s a beautiful morning .
it &apos;s noon , and it &apos;s freezing out .
phil , honey , when i &apos;m not home ,
i need you to be present and keep track of everyone .
sounds good . love you , too .
alex , do you know where haley is ?
i mean , i know she was babysitting lily last night ,
but i haven &apos;t seen her since .
by the way ,
don &apos;t read the draft i sent you last night of my college essay .
i just sent you a new version .
uh , okay . i will go read that one right now .
oh , my god . what are you doing ? are you filming me ?
yes ! i want you to see how crazy you are acting .
me ? ! i come to talk to you about something important ,
and then you start chasing me aound with the camera .
i asked you to clean up the kitchen nine hours ago
when i left for work .
i come back , and it &apos;s the exact same mess ,
plus pickles and peanut butter !
i was running around doing stuff for my crazy boss all day ,
and then i got hungry ,
and then the smell from the garbage almost made me throw up !
that &apos;s exactly how i feel !
leave me alone !
i have a lot on my plate !
yes . yes , i can see that , honey .
you left it in the sink !
oh , my god !
i waited in line for two hours , but i got it .
ooh , we making a home movie ?

hey , dad .
dad , take the phone away from your ear .
why would i do this ?
now i can &apos;t hear you .
put it in front of your face .
how &apos;d you get in my phone ?
does this mean when we talked the other day
that you knew i was in the can ?
i do now .
how was the presentation ?
actually went really well .
the client loves the whole re @-@ design .
they just want us to swap out the handles --
damn it !
i know .
only knobs want knobs .
no , joe bit me . he &apos;s teething .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a coincidence
that andy took the weekend off .
kid &apos;s like a beaver .
i &apos;m afraid to wear short pants .
hola , claire .
hey , gloria .
how &apos;s your trip ? are you having any fun ?
uh ... yeah . you know , it &apos;s a little windy , but , eh .
so , you &apos;re okay with me cutting luke &apos;s hair , right ?
hey , mom .
well , hello .
it &apos;s nice to know you &apos;re not dead in an alley somewhere .
right back at you .
yes , i am fine with you cutting his hair .
just don &apos;t leave it too long on the sides .
i am very good cutting boys &apos; hair .
you should let me cut yours someday .
okay , bye @-@ bye , gloria .
you still there ?
crap . dad , did you know
it was mitchell &apos;s birthday today ?
of course . i already called him
because i &apos;m a considerate person
who really cares about his family .
i reminded him and dialed the phone .
fly safe .
and remember you can recline .
it &apos;s still america up there .
thanks , dad .
happy birthday !
oh , hey . is it still my birthday ?

uh , lily ,
she made me her famous chocolate @-@ chip scrambled eggs ...
... which she then watched me eat .
yeah .
you got my present , didn &apos;t you ?
no .
darn it . they promised it would be there on time .
oh , well , i can &apos;t wait to open it
and check the date on the invoice .
hey , is that claire ?
yeah .
hi , claire !
hi .
hi . hey , uh , did you , uh , show her my gift yet ?
no .
come on , show her , show her .
okay . yeah .
it &apos;s good .
wow , shalom and chh @-@ appy birthday .
i know , right ?
isn &apos;t it fantastic ?
hey , claire , did you get me some garrett &apos;s cheese
and caramel corn yet ?
oh , shoot , i forgot .
it &apos;s the one thing you had to do in chicago !
you are so right .
i &apos;m sorry that i let myself get distracted by my job .
okay , i &apos;m looking for sweet and salty , claire ,
not bitter .
我看起来像燕特尔 对吧
relax , cam .
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a kiosk around here that sells it .
good .
guys , listen , yesterday , did haley mention
where she was gonna go after she babysat for lily ?
no , but when you do talk to her ,
can you tell her
to please be careful with my powder @-@ blue suit
that cam let her borrow without asking me ?
why did she want a suit ?
a friend of hers needs it for a wedding ,
and mitchell needs to stop
dressing like he &apos;s in a barbershop quartet .
lily , honey ,
did haley say where she was going when she left here ?
who wants to know ?
aunt claire .
hey , aunt claire . i heard you were being mean to haley .
i was not mean to haley .
okay , you &apos;re screaming .
i don &apos;t know where she went . maybe dylan knows .
dylan ? why would dylan know ?
he came over , and they were talking on the couch
while i was in the other room ...
behaving .
she &apos;s still talking to dylan ? really ?
oh , wait , guys , i got to go .
uh , happy birthday , babs .
what does she mean by that ?
hi , honey .
oh , don &apos;t read that last draft .
i just changed something in paragraph three .
oh , oh , that &apos;s too bad .
paragraph three had some of my favorite --
oh , please , i can see your eyes
darting around the screen .
just read the new one .
can you just do me a favor and call your sister ?
if she &apos;s screening , i &apos;m not making the cut .
why don &apos;t you just snoop on her facebook page
with your fake profile ?
i don &apos;t have a fake profile .
mom , save it . brody kendall just logged in .
that trick might &apos;ve worked on haley ,
but i know that &apos;s a picture of chachi .
oh , my god . what ?
please tell me that &apos;s some kind of mistake !
where ? which paragraph ?
get your father -- now !
dad , mom needs you !
tell her i &apos;m in the shower !
honey , who do we call ? what do we do ?
失踪多久才能立案
there &apos;s no way haley &apos;s married .
如何定位手机
then why did she change her facebook status ?
she probably didn &apos;t .
it could be a computer glitch , someone hacked her account .
i just think we should stay calm until we know the story .
honey , i cannot get on a plane for four hours
and be out of touch and not know what happened !
it &apos;s not just the facebook thing .
she borrowed a blue suit from mitchell for a wedding .
something borrowed , something blue ?
do you get it ?
who would she even marry ?
i don &apos;t know , but she was with dylan yesterday ,
and if she was gonna marry him ,
she would definitely hide that from us .
迪兰 · 马沙尔
but that makes no sense . why wouldn &apos;t he call me ?
oh , hey , mrs. &quot; d. &quot;
hey , dylan !
oh , hi , mr. &quot; d &quot; !
are you with haley ?
in what way ?
physically , romantically , maritally ?
no . i &apos;m at work . i have a career now .
hey , uh , can you hold this phone for a second ?
so , you have no idea where haley is right now ?
you mean spiritually , geographically ?
can you please stop spinning that sign ?
no . my boss says if i do ,
he &apos;ll replace me with one of those guys !
go back to where you came from !
dylan , focus !
i don &apos;t know where she is ,
but i can sense that she &apos;s okay .
it &apos;s like we share the same brain .
who has it now ?
okay , so , last night when you were with her ,
she didn &apos;t say anything about getting married ?
haley got married ? ! that &apos;s so upsetting !
done .
hi , mom .
do you have haley &apos;s icloud password ?
yeah , she gave it to me in a little envelope
with her diary key
and a list of things she &apos;s most afraid of .
maybe we could guess it .
claire , you accidentally hung up on me .
oh , yeah , well , honey , you know me and computers .
mom &apos;s trying to guess haley &apos;s icloud password .
which , personally , i think is an invasion of her privacy .
ooh , try &quot; password . &quot;
i &apos;m kind of glad that didn &apos;t work .
wait , i think i remember telling her to use something
that people wouldn &apos;t know about her ,
like her favorite literary character .
i &apos;m in !
what ? what was it ?
snoopy .
and that could be your new nickname .
okay . find my iphone .
oh , no ! she &apos;s in vegas .
are you serious ?
oh , hang on . i &apos;m zooming in . hold on , hold on .
let me see what i can , uh ...
come on .
and -- oh , god !
honey , she &apos;s at a wedding chapel !
okay , that &apos;s troubling , but think about it .
if she &apos;s not with dylan , who would she be marrying ?
i don &apos;t know !
alex , she had to have told you something !
okay , you are really rubbing in our lack of closeness .
she won &apos;t even tell me what conditioner she uses .
i have 12 minutes ! think !
i don &apos;t know . ask uncle mitchell .
they &apos;re always giggling about boys .
oh , good ! okay , yes , i &apos;m gonna do that .
i &apos;m calling him .
if it helps ,
i can alert my magician contacts in vegas .
although , they are better at making girls disappear
than they are finding them .
what ?
lily , honey , i need you get mitchell .
but they said i could have 20 minute of ipad time .
mitchell ? mitchell ? !
hey , what &apos;s up ?
i @-@ i really need to talk to mitchell .
it &apos;s my ipad time !
honey , what did i tell you about being selfish ?
aunt claire needs to speak to other daddy
just as soon as she gets me my popcorn .
what ? you , cam , i promise you ,
i will get you your popcorn ,
but right now , i need to talk to mitchell !
okay , cheese and caramel .
fine .
and caramel .
fine .
hey , what &apos;s up ?
so , i &apos;m pretty sure that haley is getting married in vegas .
what ? !
what ? !
yeah , i need to know who she &apos;s been dating .
t @-@ there was this one guy who she thought
that she might like , but , i don &apos;t know .
she was weirdly secretive about him ,
but i @-@ i guess that could still be thing .
oh , hang on , hang on , getting a call from dad .
do the thing .
do the cute thing .
dad ?
claire ?
dad ?
mitchell ?
what are you doing in my phone ?
you called me , dad .
no , i didn &apos;t . i &apos;m shooting a video with joe .
am i in your kitchen with you ?
no .
then you &apos;re not shooting a video with joe .
hi , jay ! claire was just about to go run an errand !
are you kidding me ? !
okay , for god sakes . hold--
would you mind watching my computer for me for a minute ?
thank you so much .
of course , dear .
hey , mitch , i &apos;m liking the new hat .
it gives you some presence .
what you getting at , dad ?
nothing . it &apos;s a strong look .
y @-@ you like one of those tough guys in an old western movie .
really ?
yeah .
oh , i guess it is kind of badass .
what if i tilt it a little bit ?
you ruined it .
i like your hat . it suits you .
oh , thank you , ma &apos;am .
well , you &apos;re welcome .
okay , thank you .
all right , got your life @-@ changing popcorn .
yes !
now , can we get back to figuring out who haley married ?
haley got married ? !
oh my gosh , i hope it was no to jackson .
jackson !
he was into some weird food .
oh , god !
whoa , haley got married ? ! she is in so much trouble !
luke , what have you done to your hair ? !
claire , when you react like this ,
you &apos;re just giving him what he wants .
luke said that you knew about it !
i didn &apos;t know about it !
i said a parent knew about it .
phil !
i know we &apos;re not there yet ,
but i &apos;ve been researching annulments .
oh , we are there
because you let our child get a mohawk !
sweet !
we ... had a bet .
you let him get a mohawk because he won a bet ? !
no , he lost the bet .
what ? ! phil !
well , i @-@ i , would you rather i had a mohawk ?
i have a career .
i @-@ i don &apos;t have time for this .
we &apos;ve got to get back to figuring out
who haley has married in vegas .
hold on . someone &apos;s at the door.- okay .
so , haley &apos;s in vegas ?
yes .
if you want , i can call andy .
he &apos;s there , too . maybe he can find her .
andy &apos;s in vegas ?
yeah , he borrowed some cuff links
from me for some wedding .
oh , my god ,
you guys don &apos;t think that haley married andy , do you ?
haley married andy !
what ? !
what bet did he lose ?
no , no , no , no , no , no .
andy is dating some girl in utah ,
and haley knows that .
even if haley was attracted to him ,
i would hope she would have the decency
and the self @-@ control--
oh , my god ! oh , my god , she married andy !
i knew she was still into him .
she said he wasn &apos;t her type , but i &apos;m like ,
&quot; he &apos;s a man . he &apos;s breathing . &quot;
maybe this is why she doesn &apos;t talk to me about things .
no , it can &apos;t be him . he &apos;s a very nice boy .
claire , trust me ,
andy &apos;s not gonna run off and elope with haley .
he &apos;s a stand @-@ up guy .
it &apos;s a package for haley .
open it .
well , that seems like an invasion of her priv--
open it !
&quot; what to expect when you &apos;re expecting . &quot;
oh , my god !
i told you he was a stand @-@ up guy .
she &apos;s not answering , phil .
are you calling andy ?
it &apos;s going straight to voice mail .
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s pregnant .
let &apos;s not jump to any conclusions .
jump ? let &apos;s review .
she &apos;s been moody , eating weird food ,
getting nauseous .
she left in the middle of the night
for a wedding chapel in vegas with her secret love ,
and most suspicious of all , she bought a book !
oh , no . what if you &apos;re right ?
what will we do ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll kill that andy .
how could he be so irresponsible ?
i mean , he &apos;s a good kid .
but to run off with my baby girl
after i fell for his &quot; aw , shucks &quot; act !
which is probably not an act because he &apos;s genuinely nice
and he thinks &quot; shucks &quot; is the &quot; s &quot; word .
still , i want to kill him !
but that would be robbing my grandchild
of probably a really great father .
damn you , andy bailey !
his last name is bailey ?
oh , my god , she &apos;s gonna be haley bailey .
wait . i just thought of something .
what ?
i &apos;m going to be the first woman in my family
not to get pregnant and drop out of college .
ooh , maybe that should be my essay .
i graduated from college .
yeah , and haley got kicked out of college
before she got pregnant .
okay , hang on , honey . i am sending you a picture .
do you think that this arsonist looks like andy with a beard ?
no . he &apos;s not an arsonist .
gloria hired him to take care of her baby .
gloria . right , of course .
you know how protective she is .
i &apos;m sure she had him thoroughly vetted .
hola !
gloria , where did you find andy ?
at the park , chasing some children .
oh , my god .
i &apos;m gonna call him again .
hey , mom , check it out .
god , luke , what have you done ? !
i know . what does he have to rebel against ?
haley pregnant and me in a mohawk --
this year &apos;s christmas card is gonna rule .
what &apos;s going on ? did you find her ?
no , dad , no , i haven &apos;t found her . and you know what ?
this is all your fault
because you two introduced
this horny stranger into our lives .
let me get this straight .
you &apos;re mad because your daughter got knocked up
and ran off with some goofy guy
to get married behind your back .
i can &apos;t even imagine what that must feel like .
really ? now ?
i can &apos;t think of a better time .
jay , stop kicking her while she &apos;s down ,
pointing out her mistakes at the same time
the whole universe is telling her
that she &apos;s a terrible mother !
oh , my god , okay , can &apos;t do this . got to go . bye .
i miss my little girl !
claire , don &apos;t do that .
yes , claire , don &apos;t do that !
look ...
you &apos;re not gonna find her at the bottom of that tin .
you &apos;re not near the bottom of that tin , are you ?
i &apos;m gonna be a grandmother !
aww , there , there , dear .
okay , claire ...
we don &apos;t know anything for sure yet .
so take a deep breath ...
... put the popcorn down ...
and just get your ...
not cool , grandma !
okay , claire , listen , listen .
sometimes life hands you things that you don &apos;t want
and -- and they turn out to be exactly what you need .
and , oh , my god ,
i think i just talked myself into liking this hat
because i keep seeing myself in it ,
and i &apos;m like , &quot; who is that handsome yentl man ?
are you serious right now ?
快看安迪刚发了什么
oh , god , i got to go .
i &apos;m sorry . i wasn &apos;t that helpful . are you okay ?
our little baby got married without us .
i was supposed to give her away .
i was supposed to walk her down the aisle
and give her husband @-@ to @-@ be one of these .
&quot; that &apos;s my baby girl .
you take care of her . &quot;
yeah .
&apos;cause that &apos;s what dads do .
i got to call my dad .
please don &apos;t tell him
i was in charge when she left .
hello . can you see me ?
thumb , dad .
the minute they got rid of rotary phones ,
everything went to hell .
dad , i &apos;m really sorry that i eloped .
you were a great dad ,
and you should &apos;ve been there to walk me down the aisle ,
and --
and i &apos;ve never apologized for taking that away from you .
well , we got to do that thing in hawaii , and that was nice .
yeah . guess what goes around comes around , huh ?
look ... you &apos;re in the eye of the tornado right now ,
and you can &apos;t see anything but
your life swirling around you .
but andy &apos;s a good guy , just like phil ,
and years from now , you might look back on this
and think , &quot; the best thing that could &apos;ve happened ...
was that dipstick knocking up my daughter . &quot;
that &apos;s so sweet .
was he listening ? !
yeah .
this dipstick loves you , too , jay !
i take it all back !
jay !
wait a minute . wait a minute .
i am trying to fix it !
gloria &apos;s talking to me . some of it &apos;s in english .
claire , claire ! look , look , i fix luke &apos;s hair !
oh , my god , he looks like shemp !
okay , yes , it &apos;s true , but --
but maybe if i cut a little bit more on the sides or in --
oh , no , no , no . no more cutting .
just give me a chance to get used to it .
oh , it &apos;s haley ! haley &apos;s calling !
what ? !
hi , mom .
&quot; hi , mom &quot; ? !
we have been trying to get in touch with you all day !
i &apos;ve been in bed .
oh , goodness .
i don &apos;t think we need to hear the details .
haley ... we know everything .
and i understand why you hid it from us ,
and while we are not happy , young lady ,
we &apos;re gonna work this out .
uh , before i admit to anything ,
maybe you could be more specific ?
haley ! you &apos;re home !
yeah , i &apos;ve been home all day . i &apos;ve been sleeping .
so , you didn &apos;t get married ? !
married ? ! why would i get married ? !
because you &apos;re pregnant with andy &apos;s baby !
what ? ! why would you think that ? !
because you changed your facebook status to &quot; married &quot;
and then we tracked your cellphone
to a wedding chapel in vegas .
and you ordered this book !
wow , first of all , it &apos;s called privacy .
google it .
second , i married a cronut .
what ?
last night , my friend andy and i ,
we went to go get cronuts ,
and i said that they were so amazing ,
i wanted to marry one ,
so i posted it on facebook as a joke .
then i accidentally left my phone in andy &apos;s car ,
which he drove to a friend &apos;s wedding in vegas ,
and that book is for my crazy boss
because he &apos;s designing maternity clothes
and he wants to get inside the mind of preggos !
thank god !
i &apos;m so relieved !
wait a second .
how did you get onto my facebook page ?
i unfriended you .
she &apos;s brody kendall .
oh , my god , gross !
i &apos;ve been playing candy crush with my mother !
how did you track my phone ?
well , i don &apos;t think that really matters ,
and there &apos;s a perfectly reasona--
oh , cut it out . i can see people walking behind you .
okay , got to go .
