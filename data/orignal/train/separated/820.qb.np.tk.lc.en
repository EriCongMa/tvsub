the guys and i are about to leave for the airport ,
and i &apos;m so excited to see you .
is that ryan ?
i can &apos;t wait for you to see my hometown .
it &apos;s going to be just like an affair to remember ,
only instead of the empire state building on new year &apos;s eve ,
it &apos;s going to be a winery near the portland airport
at my dad &apos;s wedding .
anyway , i love you . i miss you .
hello ? hello ?
sounds like i lost you for a minute !
are you there .
where &apos;s my widdle eng @-@ wish man ?
and with that , ryan walked into the river thames
and accepted death .
the joke &apos;s on you , &apos; cause i wasn &apos;t even talking to him .
i was leaving a voice mail .
haven &apos;t talked to him for a week .
are you guys making a group face ?
no , we &apos;re not ...
no .
nah .
guys , look , ryan and i are great .
really ? &apos; cause he doesn &apos;t call enough .
and when he does , it &apos;s in the middle of the night .
ryan didn &apos;t want to move to england ,
he had to move to england .
for the last couple of weeks ,
you &apos;ve been keeping nick hours , and ... and it &apos;s ugly .
hey . sorry .
i was talking to ryan before he went to work
and i must have fallen asleep .
friend to friend , am i wearing pants ?
the situation isn &apos;t ideal ,
however , long distance is super romantic .
plus i don &apos;t have to shave my legs every day
which is a real plus .
you know , fawn shaves herself from toe to chin .
every single day .
god , i love my girlfriend .
oh , cece .
yeah , what ?
huge news .
jake apex is coming to the wedding .
jake apex ?
who is jake apex ?
jake apex is cece &apos;s high school crush .
never did anything for me , but turned cece to soup .
thanks .
yeah .
is he one of them portland hippies ?
&apos;cause i hate them portland hippies .
he is a legend .
every time i spoke to him ,
i &apos;d have a full @-@ blown tiny kid stroke .
hey , killer .
i ... d ... uh ... mm ...
yeah , well , i got a bad feeling about this guy .
why , because he &apos;s bomb and cece wants some ?
no . other reasons .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to go water my succulents .
how do you know apex is so cute ?
i just assumed .
winston , stop with the look , okay ?
otherwise i will murder you
and clean up your blood with your cat .
all right ? for the 50th time , i do not like schmidt .
good luck finding my cat .
you know , i haven &apos;t seen him in weeks .
my best man suit .
i &apos;m my dad &apos;s best man .
he wanted a boy . my middle name &apos;s christopher .
the co @-@ pays are awesome .
i can &apos;t believe they &apos;re also pharmacists .
that &apos;s really good .
this is a nice place .
i mean , it &apos;s not the best vineyard in portland .
here we go .
that &apos;s bartleby cellars , of course .
how would you even know that ?
whenever coach goes to a new city ,
he learns all about it , like a real weirdo .
i was an army brat , all right ?
i moved a lot . assimilating was key .
oh , and by the way ,
calling somebody weird in portland
is actually a compliment , so thank you , nick .
it &apos;s just ... oh .
sorry , i thought i heard my phone ringing .
ryan &apos;s supposed to call me before he gets on the plane .
oh ! sorry .
jess , just take your phone out .
no , nick , i want to be here with you guys .
i want to ... sorry .

i made about 12 drafts of this map .
oh , yeah . yeah .

so , here it is .
aw . i &apos;m so excited to show him portland ,

oh , there &apos;s my dad .

oh , there &apos;s my daughter .
i thought we talked about you not calling me that .
hey , how &apos;s the food ?
i haven &apos;t eaten in three weeks .
trying to fit into my wedding dress .
had a dream about a crouton last night .
and , um ...
and that was the whole dream .
ooh , before i forget ,

that we &apos;re going to make together .
so , um ... ryan &apos;s not coming .
oh , boy .

and he thought , ultimately ,
it didn &apos;t make sense , which makes sense .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
but the tour &apos;s canceled .
hey , randy , the tour &apos;s canceled .
i don &apos;t know why i did that .
anyway , go ahead , nick . go ahead .
talk about how much this sucks .
tell me that ryan &apos;s not coming
&apos;cause he &apos;s a blank who &apos;s a blank .
i do have one thing to say .

i &apos;m going full portland , people .
i &apos;m so portland right now , they all staring at me
like , &quot; is that the president of portland ? &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; no . &quot;
this is the very pizza place where we &apos;d dab our pizzas
with our napkins , to get the grease off ,
and then we &apos;d make this kid named joey
eat the napkins .
i &apos;m not gonna lie ...
i &apos;m joey .
oh , my god .

way to the left .
i &apos;m super nervous .
now my hands are sweating .

oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
hey , nick , can i have my phone ?

damn men .
oh , i feel so bad for you .
hey , mom ... mom ...
oh , honey ...
don &apos;t get emotional , okay ?
&apos;cause if you get emotional , i &apos;ll get emotional .
let &apos;s talk about happy stuff .
did you guys see the video of
the panda farting and falling of a branch ?
pretty crazy , man .
it was funny . it was funny .
it made me laugh .
who wants scramblies ?
you know i do , mom .
good .
look , this might not be the right time to say this ,
you guys , but , uh ,
should we take a straw poll
on this whole cosby thing ?
i just want to clarify
to everyone here that i am fine .
which is why i &apos;m fine .
great !
yeah .
finer than fine . mm @-@ hmm .
which is why i &apos;m fine .
fantastic !
i &apos;m fine , too . everybody &apos;s great .
perfect .
i &apos;m not fine !
i can &apos;t do this anymore .
it &apos;s not all smiles and sunshine .
it &apos;s not !
look , ryan bailed and that &apos;s a dick move .
and that &apos;s the truth .
i &apos;m fine , i &apos;m just gonna go to my room .
i made scones .
was that sunshine or smiles ? hmm ?
joanie ...
i don &apos;t want to lie to you , so i &apos;m not--
there &apos;s shells all in these eggs .
so , joan , how do you , uh , feel about bob getting remarried ?
mm ! oh , i &apos;m fine .
i just feel bad for ashley .
i mean , let &apos;s just say
he &apos;s a man with a healthy appetite ,
except one thing .
well , that &apos;s a visual .
i don &apos;t really have a burning desire
to stick around for the wedding ,
so i &apos;m going on a trip with some friends .
a trip i &apos;ve never taken before .
hey ! you mind if i turn this down ?
&quot; ap stat jams . &quot;
advanced placement .
very smart .
how many lilith fairs did you go to ?
oh , method man performed at that one ?
it &apos;s liliths fair .
like &quot; passersby ... &quot;
or &quot; attorneys general . &quot;
well , look , i came to , uh ... give you this .
text ryan as much as you want , it &apos;s none of my business .
i just think long @-@ distance relationships suck .
i once broke up with a woman who lived in irvine ,
and that &apos;s only 30 minutes away .
mind you , i had hornets living in my car at the time ,
which was a factor ,
but the commute was also a big part of it .
well , look , nick , we &apos;re different ,
and just because it &apos;s difficult with ryan ,
doesn &apos;t mean we &apos;re doomed .
we &apos;re star @-@ crossed lovers .
we &apos;re like kate and leo ...
or ... claire and leo , or ...
whatever blonde leo is taking on boats .
they &apos;re all doomed .
leo ain &apos;t gonna settle down-- he ain &apos;t ready .
i &apos;m a hopeless romantic , and i always have been .
which is why ...
i mean , it &apos;s a nice notion , it &apos;s just ...
... from 1994 to 2001,
i believed that jordan catalano
was gonna show up in my driveway
after a dirt bike accident ,
all scruffy and ... beautiful ...
and he would need a bath and some ...
medical attention .
you think that little boy is driving a dirt bike ?
he looks a lot like you .
that &apos;s me , that &apos;s jordan catalano .
i honestly couldn &apos;t tell the difference .
i swear to god . i &apos;m not trying to be mean .
you know what the problem with jordan catalano is ?
yeah-- an undiagnosed learning disability .
oh , i didn &apos;t know the boy had mental problems--
i wouldn &apos;t be teasing him , but ...
no , it &apos;s that he &apos;s fake .
the only thing that matters
is if the guy is there for you when you need him .
otherwise , you &apos;re dating a wall .
i have to get to my dad &apos;s wedding .
i didn &apos;t come in here trying to be harsh , i &apos;m ju ...
i was trying to be helpful and it &apos;s not working and i apologize .
i was coming in as a friend , je ...
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s just her .
well , the dream &apos;s dead .
apparently , jake apex has to work ,
so he &apos;s not gonna come to the wedding .
i &apos;m wearing the craziest underwear for nothing .
okay , look , cece , you know what we do ? we regroup .
no , it &apos;s fine , schmidt . i &apos;m over it .
it is not fine .
look , cece , you &apos;re the most amazing woman i ever met .
if you want jake apex ,
i &apos;m gonna help you get jake apex .
i &apos;m never gonna stop trying to make you happy , cece .
i promise you , for the rest of my ...
oh , look at that , it &apos;s fawn .
hello , councilwoman moscato .
guys !
i forgot the rings at the house .
they &apos;re in my purse in my room .
and now i have to go get my dad ready .
apparently , he &apos;s wearing some kind of a male corset .
all right , coach and i will get the rings ...
you don &apos;t have a car .
all right . okay .
wait !
all right .
let &apos;s do this .
yeah .
okay . okay .
okay , ready ? yep , yep .
go easy . i &apos;m not on !
you &apos;re not ? ! i &apos;m not on ! i &apos;m not on !
you don &apos;t have the rings ? !
well , dad , hold on ...
you don &apos;t have the rings ? !
oh ! damn it , no ! that &apos;s ...
no , this is bad .
we &apos;re doomed !
you look beautiful , but we are doomed .
i wish these were filled with ground beef .
oh , wait , this is nick ! nick &apos;s calling !
he &apos;s probably walking in the door . here .
i found the purse ,
but your mom has the rings .
what ?
can you ask her for them ?
yeah , it &apos;s a little hard right now .
remember she said she was going on a trip ?
it &apos;s gonna be a hair longer .
it &apos;s acid , isn &apos;t it ?
what is taking them so long ?
um ... so the wedding will begin shortly .
but first , i &apos;m gonna start you off with a crowd @-@ pleasing ,
nondenominational--
something in it for everyone--
&quot; ave maria . &quot;
joan , i need you to focus .
i need you to help me find those rings .
we have the rings .
they all-- all of you ... we all have the rings .
everyone &apos;s got the ring . come into the womb .
come into the womb .
i don &apos;t want to come in the womb .
come into the womb .
i &apos;m not a womb guy ! i &apos;m not a womb guy !

reverse . birth .
can i just see that ?
reverse . birth .
that &apos;s not it .
reverse . birth .
here we go !
this is a real portland experience !
ah , hippie hair in my mouth !
hippie hair in my mouth !
and with that message from beaker ,
all of the muppets have wished bob and ashley
a very happy wedding .
except for me .
cookie monster , is that you ?
now , i understand , cookie monster ,
you &apos;ve got a very special song to sing for us .
yes , i do !
there are a lot of ways to stall a wedding , okay ?
and you just happened to ...
go talk to him .
yeah . talk to the guy you like .
hey , killer .
hey , so , uh ...
i &apos;d love to see you again before you leave .
to be honest with you , cece ,
i &apos;ve always had a crush on you .
oh , god .
okay , so i &apos;ve never said this out loud before , but ...
i &apos;m ...
in love with someone else .
it &apos;s kind of complicated because he has a girlfriend ,
so i can &apos;t tell anybody .
i mean , winston knows , but you , you don &apos;t know winston .
i got to get back to the truck soon .
power steering &apos;s out again .
i &apos;m the only one strong enough to drive it .
of course .
but , uh ,
i guess i &apos;ll see you around .
yeah , i guess .
okay , okay . got it .
oh , my god ! thank god you guys are here !
is my mom okay ?
it &apos;s actually really hard riding one of these bike ,
it &apos;s super tiring .
i don &apos;t have a watch on .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m doing that .
dad , i ...
aren &apos;t they cute ?
cute as a mute .
that &apos;s a thing .
people @-@ people say that .
love is never what you think it &apos;s gonna be , is it ?
no , it isn &apos;t .
hey , nick ...
you were right .
he should &apos;ve been here .
i need a guy who shows up .
&apos;cause anything else just isn &apos;t real .
jess , you should , uh , know something , too .
i touched both your mother &apos;s breasts
in a communal womb earlier today .
i didn &apos;t do it on purpose , but there it is .
thanks for telling me . i appreciate it .
it &apos;s a relief to get it off my shoulders .
thanks for being cool about it .
i &apos;ll leave you alone .
wait , what ?
i didn &apos;t read about this place .
that &apos;s because it &apos;s not in any guidebook , tagliaboo .
it is called crush pond .
at least that &apos;s what jess and i used to call it .
we used to come down here when she liked somebody .
we &apos;d throw a rock in the pond ,
and we &apos;d wish that they liked her back .
huh . i &apos;d sit over there and smoke cloves while she did that .
i broke up with ryan .
wow . oh , babe , i &apos;m sorry .
how &apos;d he take it ?
actually , pretty good .
so you got his voice mail .
yeah .
sounds about right .
last stop on the tour .
um ... it &apos;s crush pond .
so ... say a name in your head
and throw the rock in the pond ,
and they &apos;ll love you forever .
um , and for the record , that &apos;s actually never worked .
so we &apos;re gonna do it anyways ?
yeah .
we &apos;re really gonna do this ?
i got a big one .
i know who your rock is for .
winston , you better shut up
before i knock that fade right off your head .
you don &apos;t know me like that , cece . i swear ...
oh , i know you like that , trust me .
swear to god ...
uh , i &apos;m gonna say detroit pistons .
you &apos;re not getting it , man .
what @-@ what is it ?
you got to say , like , a lady &apos;s name .
gladys .
a lady you know .
to whoever you are , can &apos;t wait to meet you .
and i hope you live close by .
three , two , one .
