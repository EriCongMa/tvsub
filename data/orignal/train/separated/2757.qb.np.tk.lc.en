yeah , you have homosexual hair .
so did she ... ?
twice .
twice ?
oh , that sucks .
you guys okay ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s weird .
i know she &apos;s gone , but i just don &apos;t feel ....
maybe she &apos;s not really gone .
no , no , she &apos;s gone .
we checked .
a lot .
no , i mean , maybe no one ever really goes .
ever since my mom died , every now and then ...
... i get this feeling that she &apos;s right here , you know ?
and debbie , my friend from junior high ...
... got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course .
i always get this strong debbie vibe ...
... when i use a little yellow pencil .
i miss her .
here , pheebs .
want this ?
oh , thanks .
sure .
i just sharpened her this morning .
i don &apos;t believe any of that . when you &apos; re dead ...
... you &apos; re dead . you &apos; re gone . you &apos; re worm food .
so chandler looks gay , huh ?
i don &apos;t know who this is , but it &apos;s not debbie .
dad , let &apos;s just make a decision .
you &apos;re right . it &apos;s going into the ground .
we should get the most basic thing .
&quot; the non @-@ protective corrugated fiberboard with white laminate . &quot;
dad , we can &apos;t bury nana in a dresser from kea .
this is why your mother buys my clothes .
i hate to shop . i hate it .
isn &apos;t this more about the fact that ...
... once you decide , it &apos;s like acknowledging nana &apos;s actually gone ?
no , i really hate to shop .
i thought it &apos;d be a closed casket .
lt doesn &apos;t mean she can &apos;t look nice .
sweetie , you think you can get in there ?
i don &apos;t see why not .
here &apos;s my retainer .
i was just thinking ...
... when my time comes
dad .
listen to me .
when my time comes , i wanna be buried at sea .
you what ?
i wanna be buried at sea . it looks like fun .
define &quot; fun . &quot;
come on . you &apos;ll make a day of it . you &apos;ll get a boat , pack a lunch ....
and then we throw your body in the water . gee , that does sound fun .
everyone thinks they know me . everyone says i &apos;m so predictable .
maybe after i &apos;m gone , they &apos;ll say , &quot; buried at sea ? huh ? &quot;
that &apos;s probably what they &apos;ll say .
i &apos;d like that .
hey , gorgeous .
hey .
look , l &apos; m sorry about yesterday .
don &apos;t worry . apparently , other people have made the same mistake .
okay . phew !
so , what do you think it is about me ?
i don &apos;t know what .
you just have ...
... a quality .
a quality . great .
it &apos;s a shame . you and lowell would &apos;ve made a great couple .

brian &apos;s a little out of your league .
excuse me . you don &apos;t think i could get a brian ?
because i could get a brian . believe you me .
i &apos;m really not .
this one ?
i &apos;ve shown you every dress we have .
unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon @-@ yellow pantsuit ...

whatever we pick , she &apos;d say it &apos;s the wrong one .
right . we &apos;ll go with the burgundy .
a fine choice . i &apos;m coming out .
wait ! we need shoes .
how about these ?
that &apos;s really a day shoe .
where she &apos;s going everyone else will be dressier ?
could we see something in a slimmer heel ?
i have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy .
i can show you something silver that may work .
no , it really should be burgundy .
unless we go with a different dress .
no , no , no . watch this .
wait , i may have something in the back .
oh , my god .
is everything all right ?
just nana &apos;s stuff .

or i didn &apos;t spend enough on flowers . or she &apos;d say :
&quot; why waste your money ? i don &apos;t need flowers , l &apos; m dead . &quot;
that sounds like nana .
do you know what it &apos;s like to grow up ...
... with someone who is critical of every single thing you say ?
i can imagine .
it &apos;s a wonder your mother turned out ...
... to be the positive , life @-@ affirming person she is .
that is a wonder .
so tell me something , mom . if you had to do it all over again ...
... i mean , if she was here right now ...
... would you tell her ?
t ell her what ?
how she drove you crazy , picking on every little detail .
like your hair , for example .
i &apos;m not sure i know what you &apos;re getting at .
would things have been better if you &apos;d just told her the truth ?
no .
some things are better left unsaid .
it &apos;s nicer when people just get along .
more wine ?
oh , i think so .
those earrings look really lovely on you .
thank you .
they &apos;re yours .
