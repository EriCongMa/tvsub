thank you , your honor .
and i &apos;d like to thank you
for your patience and your attention .
now it &apos;s time for you to go into that room and judge .
so let &apos;s hear the facts .
jake rickter .
family man .
business owner .
you &apos;ve probably seen his wife
and child here throughout the trial .
so why is jake on trial for first degree murder ?
jake &apos;s nine @-@ year @-@ old son died during routine oral surgery ,
and a heartbroken jake decided to sue .
that &apos;s all .
jake came to our firm , and we helped him sue the dentist .
that was a year ago .
and as you know , that suit was adjudicated
by judge philip ellerbee .
judge ellerbee decided against jake ,
and that &apos;s where all this would have ended ,
except two months later ,
judge ellerbee was found stabbed to death in his home .
now why do i find myself
showing you these crime scene photos
even more than the state &apos;s attorney ?
because i think this murder cries out for justice .
but instead , glenn childs ,
knowing his term as state &apos;s attorney
would be over in two days ...
objection .
sustained .
... as has been testified to previously--
judge ellerbee was wearing both gloves that night ,
but as you can see in the prosecutor &apos;s own photos ,
there was one missing .
police can &apos;t locate it .
glenn childs can &apos;t locate it .
and you heard testimony from our expert witness that ,
given the direction of the knife attack ,
this glove would most certainly have the killer &apos;s blood on it .
and yet , the one piece of evidence that could have led
to exoneration is gone-- why ?
you &apos;ve also heard testimony that judge ellerbee was involved
in several other controversial decisions ,
and has a multitude of enemies ,
and yet , mr. childs here would have you believe ...
oh , hey . how &apos;d it go ?
will &apos;s doing well , but i don &apos;t know--
i think we only have one juror , juror number two .
this is hard .
people want to blame someone for a judge killing .
oh , when you get a chance , we need to talk .
about ?
nothing bad .
we &apos;re expanding , and i think
you should consider taking on a bigger role .
what role ?
we &apos;ll talk .
heading up to the thirtieth . more office space .
hi , owen . how &apos;s parenting ?
oh , it is rough .
what are you watching ?
i &apos;m working hard .
have you seen reality tv during the day ?
it is so-- i don &apos;t know-- like , last days of pompeii .
more on the rickter trial ?
yeah . will &apos;s office ?
nah , i &apos;ll take it .
so , hey , we decided on italian tonight at 6 : 00 . are you free ?
i will be by then . where ?
um , johnnie &apos;s . 6 : 00 ?
okay , i will see you then .
oh , and , owen ,
thank you , by the way .
oh , no . come on , you &apos;re my big sis .
and you know what ? don &apos;t worry .
they ... they seem fine .
really ?
yeah . you and i were catatonic when mom and dad split .
so you &apos;re not telling anyone ?
about the separation ?
no , not yet .
not even will ?
that was a joke , alicia .
hello ?
uh ... owen , i &apos;m gonna have to call you back .
courtney ?
courtney !
get diane .
tell her it &apos;s urgent .
hey .
look .
okay .
don &apos;t move .
i &apos;m not .
it came in that envelope ?
yes .
keep your fingers where they are .
i am . courtney &apos;s getting diane .
anybody else touch it ?
the glove or the envelope ?
the glove .
no , i didn &apos;t even touch it .
it just slipped right out .
sophia russo .
hey , it &apos;s me . look ,
when do you start at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
why ? you want to come work for me ?
does your firm still run dna testing ?
yeah . why ?
we need to hire you for a few days , but ...
you need to come here right now .
my next call is to the police .
where ?
lockhart / gardner , 27th floor .
okay .
and give me ten minutes before you call the cops .
head out now .
who was that ?
a friend .
that &apos;s probably will .
jury instruction just ended .
yeah ?
is alicia there ?
uh , she can &apos;t talk right now .
just tell her ...
i &apos;ll call her later .
where &apos;s the candidate &apos;s head about this ?
running again ?
he &apos;s not there yet .
he wants to make a good show
with the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
good . well , he shouldn &apos;t think about any of this .
that &apos;s our job . and yours .
in the meantime , eli , make yourself comfortable .
democratic committee takes care of its own .
good . i like being taken care of .
we have some law firms
who will give you office space and a salary .
we need to get you paid between the campaigns .
and you need to take this time to think statewide .
illinois &apos;s more conservative than you might think .
we &apos;ll need peter at family events
with his kids , his wife .
especially the wife .
you should see the polling on mrs. florrick after her interview .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s going to want to get too involved again .
oh , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s her choice , is it ?
look , without her , peter &apos;s a john
who overpaid for a prostitute .
with her , he &apos;s kennedy .
and now we leave it in your hands .
if you have any questions ,
petie will be at your door .
thank you .
you okay ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t want to lose them .
no matter what the jury does ,
we &apos;ll appeal .
a kid should make it easier .
it just makes it harder .
i &apos;ll call you tonight .
hey . what &apos;s wrong ?
where ?
no , i &apos;ll come to you .
just give me ... 20 minutes .
this is a tough one .
you have no chain of custody .
it could be a prank .
mm , or it could be someone from the police department
who didn &apos;t like the way this went down .
a whistle @-@ blower ?
yeah . i mean , the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
is in transition-- anything goes .
what &apos;s going on ? i got eight calls .
yeah , we have an issue here .
the glove . it was sent to our office .
what ?
the judge &apos;s glove .
it &apos;s sitting on alicia &apos;s desk right now .
i ... who sent it ?
we don &apos;t know . we phoned the police .
they &apos;re a few minutes away . you need to get to the judge .
they &apos;ll say we created it .
they &apos;ll say there &apos;s no chain of custody .
i know . get to the judge .
one second . wait one second !
guys , just give us one minute , please .
thanks .
jake , i &apos;m sorry to ask you this ,
but i don &apos;t have time to be diplomatic .
is there a chance your blood is on the missing glove ?
the ... ? what ?
the bloody glove .
there &apos;s a chance we have it .
could your blood be on it ?
no ... no .
okay . i just needed to ask .
what &apos;s going on ?
if , hypothetically ,
we were worried about evidence collection here ...
with the blood ?
yes . not that it &apos;ll be lost ,
but the crime lab is backlogged ,
and they &apos;ll have no incentive to rush this .
what are we thinking here ?
what do you want me to be thinking ?
how long will it take your firm to run dna ?
pcr testing ? that &apos;s 24 hours .
it &apos;s gonna cost you .
and we need something to test .
and the memo is privileged lockhart / gardner work product .
that memo with the dried blood on it ?
have you called the police ?
yeah . they &apos;ll be here in seconds .
how many times are you gonna say that ?
come on , glenn .
what i understand .
your honor , please , this is insane .
i mean , ten minutes after the jury &apos;s instructed , will ?
i can &apos;t control when evidence is sent to me , glenn .
but you can control when you send it to yourself .
oh , you &apos;re saying i created this ? !
absolutely .
give me a break !
you &apos;re , like , ten years old !
okay . yes , everybody &apos;s indignant .
mr. gardner has a point , mr. childs .
i myself have witnessed prosecutorial misconduct .
meaning what , your honor ?
but ... mr. gardner ,
the jury &apos;s deliberating .
yes , and we would ask for a mistrial .
oh , come on ! it &apos;s ridiculous !
we were not given access to exculpatory evidence ,
a clear brady violation .
excuse me . it &apos;s not our evidence .
we don &apos;t even know what it is !
thank you , everyone .
mr. gardner ,
your motion for a mistrial is denied ,
but bring me proof that this glove is the glove ,
that it has been purposefully kept from you ,
or that it has some probative impact ,
and i will reconsider . thank you .
thank you , your honor .
mr. gardner ?
i &apos;m your friend here .
you won &apos;t have many friends in appellate court .
i know .
no , i don &apos;t think you do .
judges protect their own .
they won &apos;t be tempted to reverse a guilty verdict .
what do you suggest ?
well , if i were in a suggesting mood ,
i would suggest that you use your time wisely ,
because when that jury comes in ,
it &apos;s out of my hands .
thank you , your honor .
we have until the jury comes in .
well , to say the least ,
we &apos;ve had a dramatic turn of events recently .
so , we &apos;re having the blood on the glove tested independently ,
and we should have the results tomorrow .
in the meantime-- three prongs .
keep tabs on the jury &apos;s progress .
when the jury comes in , our clock runs out .
i &apos;m on it . i know the sheriff .
good .
the second prong--
the state &apos;s attorney .
he can stop this case based on new evidence ,
but glenn childs won &apos;t . it &apos;s his swan song .
so we need to get to the new state &apos;s attorney ,
and prep him on childs &apos; intransigence .
i &apos;ll talk to him . i &apos;m at the courthouse anyway .
good . the third prong-- who is the whistle @-@ blower ?
the police said they would check the fingerprints on the envelope ,
but given the usual crime lab delays ,
i wouldn &apos;t expect anything fast .
so , how did this envelope get to us ?
it &apos;s not the envelope .
what ?
the envelope the police collected is not the envelope .
what do you mean ?
bob , the delivery pouch for will gardner--
did you open it ?
the one an hour ago ?
yeah . why ?
where is it ?
well , you just can &apos;t stay away , can you ?
you &apos;ll test it for prints ?
sure .
why not ? what else have i got to do ?
you want me to do some random urine testing while i &apos;m at it ?
no , but it &apos;s a long day yet .
hey , you still get a drink after work ?
do i ... ? yeah .
where ?
hey , good job on the envelope .
i &apos;m heading to the courthouse now .
you going through suspects ?
yes . trying to find dna
to compare with the glove . but will ...
yes ?
ride down with me .
when you talk to peter ...
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;ll be fine .
no , no , i know . it &apos;s just ...
there might be tension .
i just don &apos;t want you to be unprepared .
for ... ?
we &apos;ve been having some ... troubles .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
no , no , don &apos;t be .
it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s a long time coming .
alicia , i &apos;m sorry .
he thinks ... ?
no , no . it &apos;s nothing . i &apos;m over @-@ worrying it .
it &apos;ll be fine .
you all right ?
we &apos;ll talk .
i have to look through some cases .
the democratic committee has given me my pick
of chicago firms to set up
my political consulting shingle ,
but i know you &apos;re expanding here .
i also know that one of your most valuable clients ,
patrick edelstein , took his lobbying business
to greybridge associates
because you had nothing in @-@ house .
you &apos;re offering your services ?
i &apos;m offering you the chance to vie for my services .
really ?
and why do we warrant this ...
largesse ?
i think of you and will as family .
this is confidential ,
but i want to run my first campaign in @-@ house from here :
peter florrick for governor .
with mrs. florrick here ,
it feels like the perfect fit .
yes ... a strangely perfect fit .
okay , these are our suspects .
every civil case judge ellerbee presided over
in the last five years .
it &apos;s too much dna to collect , so we need to prioritize .
him .
sal barberini .
his construction business lost a federal bid .
he sued .
judge ellerbee decided against him .
and ... ?
and barberini has a history of violence .
criminal record ?
no .
okay , i &apos;ll get to him ,
see if i can get a dna sample .
hey , did you get anything ?
you got two sets of prints on the envelope .
two with iafis matches ?
yeah . one &apos;s an ex @-@ con , the other &apos;s ex @-@ military .
no cops ?
no . either your whistle @-@ blower was wearing gloves
or he &apos;s an ex @-@ con or ex @-@ military .
i &apos;m not here .
you &apos;re not here ?
i &apos;m not here officially .
yes , but you will be here .
all i &apos;m saying is this case was mishandled .
childs wants to go out with a bang ,
so he &apos;s not thinking rationally .
what is rationally ?
well , if there is other blood on this judge &apos;s glove ,
then maybe it &apos;ll point to the real killer .
and this glove just wound up on your desk ?
alicia &apos;s desk .
oh , alicia &apos;s desk .
i just find it odd that it should appear
at such an opportune moment .
well , it &apos;s not that opportune .
the jury is deliberating . look , just so i &apos;m clear ...
i think you &apos;re making yourself perfectly clear , will .
you &apos;re asking me to get involved in a case
that might have been mishandled by glenn childs .
yes , and might embarrass him .
and i &apos;m saying i &apos;ll look into it when i &apos;m in office .
mr. florrick ?
yeah . okay ?
things are good , right ?
good ?
yes . why wouldn &apos;t they be ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , then they probably are .
how &apos;s alicia ?
good .
she &apos;s doing well .
at work ?
yes .
it will be funny to be on the opposite side in court .
it will .
but not laugh @-@ out @-@ loud funny .
will .
you said you wanted me to tell you
when there was some sign from the jury .
the judge wants them to work through dinner .
good .
no , but they said they don &apos;t need dinner .
got it . thanks .
we got a problem here .
petie !
serve them coffee .
serve them lots of coffee .
why ? you wanna keep them awake ?
looks like the jury &apos;s coming in soon .
we &apos;re running out of time . where are you ?
i &apos;m talking to sal barberini .
... i &apos;m in construction ,
that i &apos;m automatically mobbed up .
will , let me call you back .
italian @-@ americans have contributed to the backbone of america ,
and this is the crap we get ?
listen , i &apos;m just asking you
what you did on the night of the judge &apos;s murder .
i told the cops already !
i don &apos;t hold a grudge !
what i did say was that i thought the judge was
a little disrespectful for delaying court
because of a personal matter .
joe dimaggio-- italian @-@ american .
bank of america , ever hear of that ?
started by italian @-@ americans .
what personal matters ?
i don &apos;t know .
something with his daughter and his family .
what are you ?
what ?
persian ? what if i looked at you and said ,
&quot; oh , yeah , she &apos;s a terrorist ! &quot;
no , i &apos;m looking for a current address , ma &apos;am ,
of an ex @-@ convict named robert clayton .
robert-- no , robert clayton .
um , alicia ...
what are you looking for ?
an ex @-@ con whose fingerprints are on the envelope .
why ?
bob , what &apos;s your last name ?
clayton .
why ?
why ? what &apos;s the problem ?
what &apos;d i do ?
oh , no .
why not buddhism ?
buddhists love the gays .
christians don &apos;t dislike gays .
can we please talk about something other than religion ?
here it comes . the obligatory apology .
but i mean , she works hard because she has to work hard .
hi , sis .
no , no , no , we , we understand .
yeah , we &apos;re just ...
yes , we will order you some pasta to go .
oh , they &apos;re fine . just ...
yeah , go save a life .
owen , look at you . hello .
jackie ! kids , look who it is .
it &apos;s , it &apos;s your grandmother .
what a-- oh , what a coincidence .
well , not really .
i must confess , this was our usual wednesday night dinner ,
so i thought i &apos;d come to see
if you were keeping the tradition alive .
how nice .
grace , look at you . you &apos;re ...
so pretty .
zach , taller and taller .
would you mind if i join you for a brief second ?
sure . of course .
kalinda got his dna ,
but she doesn &apos;t think sal barberini did it .
really . construction ? italian ?
did she talk to him ?
uh , yes .
also , one of the two sets of prints on the envelope ,
they came from our mailroom .
they what ?
yes . did you know we have a sex offender in our mailroom ?
the baritone at the christmas party .
i ... okay , i ...
i can &apos;t process that just yet .
i &apos;m at the door .
i just saw one go in . ask me about the case .
oh , the case ? yeah , how is jake doing ?
jake rickter ? good .
he &apos;s optimistic now that we have a new suspect .
oh , really ?
uh @-@ huh . that &apos;s good to know .
he needed a break , and this missing glove is it .
now we just need to compare the dna .
oh , no . oh , no .
your honor , i am admitting a mistake here .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor , but a juror overheard my remarks on
a call to my partner . i &apos;m admitting a problem .
a problem of your own making , will !
he wants to eject this juror
so the jury will have to start deliberations all over again .
oh , god , are you paranoid !
sometimes things just happen !
even given that , mr. childs , i don &apos;t know what other option
i have than to replace him with an alternate .
we would urge your honor to sanction mr. gardner .
i will resist that temptation .
but i do understand that there was a second juror in a bathroom stall .
you didn &apos;t know that , mr. gardner ?
no , your honor .
petie ?
and again i apologize to this court ,
but are we sure the other juror overheard me ?
juror number two ,
did you hear mr. gardner here
discussing the case in the restroom ?
yes , your honor .
then , regrettably ,
i must excuse you , juror two .
gentlemen , we will commence deliberations
tomorrow morning with the two alternates .
good night .
my , my ! you got here fast .
is it raining ?
no .
you got something on the dna ?
yeah , preliminary pcr report on the blood on the glove .
not my problem . how do you like mysteries ?
not much .
you &apos;re no fun .
who are your suspects for killing this judge ?
they &apos;re mostly men , right ?
yeah . why ?
that &apos;s too bad . dna &apos;s female .
look , it might mean nothing ,
but we think this dna could possibly lead to the killer .
oh , my god .
i just don &apos;t want you to get your hopes up .
why not ?
what do you want me to do with my hopes ?
the jury starts deliberating tomorrow , with alternates .
so we bought some time .
once it goes to appeals , it gets more difficult , okay ?
did you see your son tonight ?
yeah .
danny won a spelling bee .
really !
he &apos;s smarter than i am .
and stronger .
i don &apos;t know what i would do if my dad were in prison .
but definitely wouldn &apos;t be winning any spelling bees .
work ?
yeah .
you used to be more fun .
yeah .
maybe it was me .
maybe i was the one that was more fun .
no , no , no , no , no . it was me .
miss me ?
now you gotta kiss me .
mmm ... that &apos;s mine .
yeah .
yeah .
when ?
okay .
no , i &apos;ll be there . love you .
i have an hour .
who was that ?
that was my husband .
i have to go pick him up at the airport .
he was calling to remind me .
i didn &apos;t know you were married .
yes , you did .
no , i didn &apos;t .
kalinda , at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
i showed you his picture .
griffin-- at the north korean border .
what ? he &apos;s not going to come find you and shoot you .
i have to go to work .
did you become born again or something ?
no , i ... i have to go to work .
okay .
kalinda .
okay , where are we on suspects ?
well , on the case , nowhere ,
but i think we should look outside of them .
&quot; outside of them &quot; meaning ... ?
well , barberini mentioned how judge ellerbee
kept interrupting the case because of a family emergency--
something to do with his daughter .
i checked . she &apos;s in rehab in arizona .
so not cases , family problems ?
maybe . ellerbee went down to see her ,
but she wouldn &apos;t see him .
why ?
i don &apos;t know , but this was a month before he was killed .
at least it fits with the female dna .
we &apos;re not finding any other cases
with disgruntled females ?
not around the time of the murder .
where is she now , the daughter ?
in town .
well , then you two go question her .
actually , alicia &apos;s on the
military fingerprints on the envelope .
we traced them to the post office
two blocks from the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
great , so we think the whistle @-@ blower was an asa ?
that &apos;s the thinking . i was going to go check .
no , i &apos;ll take that .
you two go question the daughter .
hi , we ... miss ellerbee , we want ...
we wanted ... we just wanted to quest ...
yeah ?
my dad was just such a hypocrite .
coming down to phoenix like he could change the world .
the only reason he sent me to arizona in the first place
was &apos; cause he didn &apos;t want his judge friends
knowing he had a junkie daughter .
did the police question you after the murder ?
oh , yeah .
but i had an alibi .
but you held a grudge , didn &apos;t you , melissa ?
i just hated the way everybody treated him like a saint
when he was taking bribes left and right .
is your friend all right ?
hello ?
yeah , i &apos;ll be out in a second .
we have some blood from the crime scene ,
and we were hoping to exclude you as a suspect .
so if we could just take a small swab from your mouth ...
no .
it &apos;s non @-@ intrusive .
my body is a temple .
and you &apos;re not getting anything from it .
no .
the postal worker identified you .
a postal worker identified me
as the person who brought him that envelope ?
no . i showed him photos of asas .
and he recognized you as someone
who brought a package to the post office that day .
that is an air @-@ tight case .
he said you would have received a receipt just like this .
my guess is you still have it .
unless you shredded it .
just tell us , who &apos;s trying to hide the glove ? childs ?
that &apos;s just kind of odd of me , isn &apos;t it ?
prosecuting jake rickter and at the same time
i &apos;m secretly slipping you information to help free him .
an honored tradition , cary .
the transition dump .
every time there &apos;s a state &apos;s attorney turnover
little skeletons in the closet get kicked out the door ,
so they don &apos;t blow up in the face of the new state &apos;s attorney .
and excuse the mixed metaphor ,
but sometimes they seem most apt .
well , as flattering as this is--
or maybe that &apos;s not the right word--
as offensive as this is ,
i would never jeopardize a job that i love
and a case that i believe in .
in the pursuit of truth ?
i have a niece
and i sent her a university of michigan t @-@ shirt
in an envelope , and that envelope
was about , hmm , it was about yay big .
that &apos;s why your postal worker saw me and that &apos;s why you need
to keep looking for your leaker .
come on , cary , help us .
oh , it is always a pleasure , ms. lockhart .
sorry to keep you waiting .
what a day .
we found the daughter &apos;s works ,
and we &apos;re comparing the blood on the syringe with the dna , but ...
you don &apos;t think it &apos;ll pan out ?
i don &apos;t know .
the daughter was talking about her dad taking bribes ,
and i &apos;m wondering if he was hiding something .
oh , good . probably worth a look .
please .
you have a good relationship with eli gold , don &apos;t you ?
i do .
i thought so .
i like him .
me , too .
we want you to liaison with his department .
his ... ?
as part of our expansion ,
we &apos;re thinking of bringing
his consultation and lobbying firm in @-@ house .
here ?
yes .
and we want you to be the bridge
between the legal and the political .
you seem startled .
it just seems so ...
incestuous ?
no , sudden .
oh , well .
the path to the corner office is always sudden--
and incestuous .
grab the chances when they come
because they don &apos;t come again .
yes , i just ...
we got a problem .
of course we do .
the jury just called for the judge .
the lawyers are being called .
looks like the verdict &apos;s in .
they &apos;re looking cocky .
try cases with husband and wife defendants .
we did .
there are only eight in the last five years .
you &apos;re right , it was a mistake to get my hopes up .
we &apos;ll make this work .
the cases where judge ellerbee recused himself , look at them .
what ?
yes , we &apos;ve only looked at cases
that judge ellerbee presided over .
look at the ones he didn &apos;t preside over .
the ones he recused himself from ?
yes . if there was a bribe involved ,
somebody might have been angry that he dropped out .
all rise .
court is now in session .
get going .
honorable suzanne morris presiding .
thank you . please be seated .
i understand we don &apos;t have a verdict , petie ?
we just have a question ?
yes , your honor .
the jury would like a portion of judge ellerbee &apos;s decision
in the civil case read to them .
any objection ?
no , your honor .
mr. gardner ?
we need time .
we have a direction , but we need time .
mr. gardner ?
yes , your honor .
um , we would suggest to the court
that the whole transcript in context is important
as an understanding of the case .
you &apos;re kidding .
and , therefore ,
we would ask that the whole transcript be read
and not just a portion .
your honor , it &apos;s 186 pages .
in the service of justice .
we believe it &apos;s the very foundation
of our judicial system ,
as promulgated by our founding fathers ,
that comprehensiveness
be chosen over ...
... the opposite .
okay .
in the name of comprehensiveness .
how &apos;s your reading voice , petie ?
186 pages-- how long will that take ?
three hours maybe .
you have three hours .
okay . senka park development suit .
a husband and wife defendant .
lost a suit against the city .
judge ellerbee recused himself for personal reasons .
he was visiting his daughter in arizona ?
the defendants were mr. and mrs. gothard of lincoln park .
we need to get her dna .
i &apos;m on it .
i have to run , eli .
you called me .
yeah , then catch up .
i thought you &apos;d be happy .

you are so transparent , eli .
this is about peter &apos;s campaign .
what are you talking about ?
he &apos;s going to run for senate , or governor , or something .
you don &apos;t just run for state &apos;s attorney ;
it &apos;s a stepping stone .
okay , i am not admitting anything ,
but even if that were true , this has nothing to do with that .
i &apos;ve got to bring my business somewhere ,
and this place has been good to me .
a profile from two years ago .
mrs. gothard was at a fertility clinic--
can you get dna from a genetic test ?
yeah .
i &apos;m not doing this , eli .
you need to bring your business somewhere else .
no .
alicia , i &apos;ve deferred to you in many things ,
but this is a business decision .
i am bringing my consulting business here
because i think it &apos;s a good fit ,
and you are going to be the liaison
because that is a good fit , too .
now , you can find any hidden agendas you want ,
but i &apos;m not changing my business plan .

oh ... i &apos;ve been busy .
okay . all is forgiven .

he recused himself . she lost .
a $ 33 million settlement .
we have a jury deliberating .

that &apos;s a matter of opinion .
well , i think you &apos;ll find if you read this , it &apos;s not .
talk to alicia ?
told her you slept with peter ?
uh , you should read the file , cary .
so you &apos;re freezing me out because you talked to alicia ?
i &apos;m not freezing you out .

read it , cary .
it &apos;s the right thing to do .
all rise .
court is now in session .
honorable suzanne morris presiding .
thank you . please be seated .
new evidence in the form of dna testing
has surfaced in the judge ellerbee murder trial .

to reconsider prosecuting .
