mrs. grunwald ?
it was three summers ago .
she thought that somebody was after her ,
so maybe she was asking for help or a place to stay .
i can &apos;t help you .
i thought we &apos;d done a good job
of establishing a sense of trust .
that was before i realized where your loyalties were .
who else knows about my mother ?
keeping this a secret has meant that i &apos;ve had to choose
between you and them .
and you chose them .
jake . what can i do for you ?
you gotta let her move on .
have you spoken to ezra ?
i can &apos;t , emily . i told you .
this isn &apos;t about jake . he &apos;s losing malcolm .
really rather not drag you into it .
i &apos;m not leaving , ezra .
i know your mom &apos;s innocent .
wait . you were at the lake that night ?
you heard the gunshots after mrs. marin drove off ?
she wasn &apos;t there when he was killed .
that &apos;s jenna &apos;s car .
who is jenna so afraid of ?
cece drake .
an eye witness has stepped forward
重大新闻 新证人出现
and unconfirmed inside sources say
this witness has detailed information about the crime
and the parties involved .
so far , the district attorneys ...
i don &apos;t get it .
why would the cops want my mom to come in for a line up
if travis told the truth ?
do you think that &quot; a &quot; found a way to shut him up again ?
hanna , don &apos;t go there .
travis made you a promise ,
and he seems like a stand @-@ up guy .
plus he &apos;s really cute . and he &apos;s quite the dancer .
it &apos;s addressed to all of us .
&quot; if she goes free , &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll hear from me . &quot;
&quot; kisses &quot;
&quot; a &quot;
so if my mom gets off ...
cece is coming for us .
i say , bring it .
maybe then , she &apos;ll leave our parents alone .
or did she just declare wolrd war &quot; a &quot; ?
okay , travis .
we need a positive id of the woman you saw leaving the scene
before the shots were fired .
okay .
take your time .
number one , step forward .
step back .
number two , step forward .
step back .
i &apos;m not sure i can do this .
now , i &apos;m sure you all remember the witches from macbeth
and the fairies and forests of a midsummer night &apos;s dream ,
but beyond having a sorcerer as a protagonist ,
the tempest considers the magical quality of love at first sight .
the love between miranda and ferdinand
is a force of nature .
a love that reunites torn countries
and sets captive spirits free .
make sure to read the first act for next week .
miss montgomery , can i have a minute of your time ?
thanks for coming over last night .
i really needed you , i just didn &apos;t know how to ask .
yeah , of course . i &apos;m glad that i could be there for you .
as a friend .
hey . are we still on for tonight ?

it &apos;s cool . we can do dinner and a movie or something .
all right , bye .
thank you .
no . don &apos;t thank me yet .
they probably made it yesterday .
not for the coffee .
for the way you &apos;ve taken care of hanna .
i don &apos;t worry about her as much when she &apos;s with you .
mrs. marin , you didn &apos;t deserve any of this .
but i &apos;ve watched the way that you &apos;ve handled it .
hanna never settles .
when she goes after something , she &apos;s fearless .
now i know where she gets that .
well , i &apos;ve had my moments , i promise you .
yeah , but you didn &apos;t break .
caleb , after all that we &apos;ve been through ,
you can call me ashley .
i don &apos;t know what the hell is taking so long .
i can &apos;t wait any longer .
here they come .
mrs. marin , i &apos;m sidney barnes , the district attorney .
i just wanted to tell you this myself .
we &apos;re dropping the charges against you .
you &apos;re free to go .
i &apos;m thrilled for hanna and her mom ,
but i &apos;m worried for you .
if &quot; a &quot; makes good on her threat--
&quot; a &quot; is a terrorist . that &apos;s what she wants .
to make us worry . and we can &apos;t give into her .
i &apos;d feel better if we knew where cece was .
&apos;cause right now , it feels like she &apos;s everywhere .
well , we know who to look out for now .
we &apos;re so close to putting
and end to this game , paige . i can feel it .
how about until we do ,
you spend the nights at my house .
i &apos;ll know you &apos;re safe
and we &apos;ll get to be together .
i need to know that you &apos;re okay .
so , please just call emily or caleb .
just check in .
please .
mrs. marin , you look incredible .
pastor ted &apos;s jaw is gonna hit the floor
when he sees you in that dress .
it &apos;s not too much ?
no !
mom , you look perfect .
and ted may have the patience of a saint ,
but he &apos;s still a man .
he &apos;s been waiting a while .
so go out and have fun .
i love you , honey .
love you , too , mom .
bye , girls .
bye !
where do we start ?
let &apos;s start at the ends ,
and i will meet you in the middle for dessert .
she forgot her keys .
it &apos;s for all of us .
what happens if we just don &apos;t open it ?
we can &apos;t win the game if we don &apos;t know what it is .
it &apos;s a kid &apos;s coffin , right ?
it &apos;s mona .
&quot; hanna wins , so mona loses .
&quot; find her before the cops , or--
or they &apos;ll think you killed her . - a. &quot;
breaking news in of detective darren wilden .
hanna .
she &apos;s on the phone with radley .
... released a sketch of a possible suspect in the case .
if you have any ...
that &apos;s cece .
oh , my god . she really did do it .
they haven &apos;t id &apos;d her yet ,
but somebody &apos;s gonna recognize her .
well then , we better find mona fast .
okay . thanks .
mona is no longer a patient at bradley .
what ?
released or sent to another hospital ?
it &apos;s privileged information .
i &apos;ll go make a house call to dr. wren . he &apos;s privileged .
emily , can you circle back to school ?
it &apos;s french club friday ,
so maybe somebody &apos;s heard from her ?
yeah , i was supposed to meet up with paige ,
but i &apos;ll just take her with me .
i was supposed to cook dinner for jake ,
but i &apos;ll just cancel .
no !
you know what cece &apos;s capable of .
keep jet li as close as you can .
where are you going ?
to find mona .
hanna , slow down .
this could be your ex @-@ bff messing with us .
she &apos;s probably eating popcorn ,
watching us play desperately seeking mona .
if cece does have her , the cops know she killed wilden .
she has nothing to lose .
come on , wren . be home .
you &apos;re jackie , right ?
you haven &apos;t heard from mona , have you ?
seriously ?
downloaded a french app when i was in haiti .
wow , look at you . go ahead . parlez vous .
croissant ?
no , thanks .
&quot; vous faites avoir des nouvelles de mona ? &quot;
elle a appel ce matin . elle apportait le cassoulet .
i think that means mona was bringing a casserole .
okay , cut the crap , jackie . this is important .
have you heard from her or not ?
she called me this morning .
she was on her way home from her court @-@ appointed timeout .
she told me she was coming tonight .
and she just didn &apos;t show up ?
no , and i &apos;m really surprised because this was supposed to be
her welcome back party .
来自斯宾塞的短信 给我打电话
hey , spence , it &apos;s me .
we have to talk .
i wanted to believe that my sister
pulled herself out of this mess
when she left town .
前玫瑰镇居民 因达伦 · 威尔登警探的凶杀案被警方通缉问话
what is shana &apos;s connection to wren ?
i don &apos;t know , but it looks like
your ex @-@ boyfriend is moving in with his ex @-@ fiancée .
why would they keep that a secret ?
because he &apos;s your ex @-@ boyfriend .
tonight , there will be showers ...
i wanna talk to you about what happened last night .
but if i do , are you just gonna take off again ?
i had some thinking to do .
that &apos;s not good enough .
okay , you could &apos;ve called .
you could &apos;ve just sent me a text .
&quot; give me space . &quot;
i know .
three words and i would &apos;ve been fine .
i know , okay ? and i &apos;m sorry .
you ...
you can &apos;t just disappear like that .
not anymore .
not after what happened last time .
when i worry about &quot; a &quot; getting a hold of you or--
or hurting you , or worse ,
you know , i have a very real
picture of what that looks like in my mind .
i was in town , spencer , okay ? i was right here .
well , not for me , you weren &apos;t .
when i used to feel like the walls were closing in ,
i &apos;d take off .
but this time , i stayed .
for you .
you were right .
last night ...
trying to break in to dr. palmer &apos;s car ...
that &apos;s as close as i wanna get to &quot; a. &quot;
i don &apos;t want you to stop looking .
you deserve to know what happened to your mom .
i don &apos;t want &quot; a &quot; &apos; s version of the truth .
it &apos;s not worth it .
i &apos;d like a more detailed description of this girl lucy .
you needn &apos;t bother .
take this . i &apos;m hogging the kettle corn .
no , seriously , i need an intervention .
long day and a good meal .
it gets me every time .
well , i could make us some coffee .
no .
honestly , i could use the rest .
we &apos;ll watch the rest later ?
yeah , sure .
thanks .
i &apos;ll call you .
okay .
bye .
bye .
hanna , i swear i saw someone in that upstairs window .
so you think mona &apos;s just sitting in her house ,
in the dark ?
as twisted as she is ,
i wouldn &apos;t put it past her .
look , she stuck her neck out for my mom .
i know after everything she &apos;s done ,
it may seem like another one of her tricks ,
but mona would &apos;ve never confessed to killing wilden
if i didn &apos;t put that idea in her head in the first place .
hanna , if mona is really in trouble ,
it is not your fault .
you &apos;re safe here , em .
it &apos;s not me i &apos;m worried about .
it &apos;s mona .
door !
sorry .
don &apos;t be .
your parents would have the same rule if i were a guy .
if you were a guy , you wouldn &apos;t be here .
maybe we should watch a movie
to take your mind off things .
i don &apos;t know if i could sit still for that long .
i have to be honest .
i get worring about cece , but not mona .
she tried to kill you .
i know , but we created the beast .
no , ali did that .
yeah , and we let her .
how was the reading ?
intense .
one of his poems reminded me of the story
you wrote about the cat , &quot; found but lost . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe that you remember that .
i always thought it was about ali .
well , it was , i just didn &apos;t know
that when i was writing it .
probably why it was so honest .
hi . um , can i get a cappuccino ?
could i actually get a refill , too ?
that &apos;s always been what &apos;s tough for me ,
writing a good story
before i can think my way out of it .
i get it .
it &apos;s like you wanna know the ending ,
but you still wanna be surprised .
yeah . i remember when i was little ,
i &apos;d always read the last page before ...
i can &apos;t stop thinking about mona .
we know &quot; a &quot; likes to play with us ... but
this time , i don &apos;t know what the game is .
it &apos;s , &quot; i &apos;m going down
and i &apos;m dragging you with me . &quot;
they know who they &apos;re looking for now .
they &apos;re gonna find cece .
&quot; a &quot; can &apos;t even give us one day .
i mean , i &apos;m supposed to be at home
with my mom celebrating ,
and all i can think about is poor mona .
i never , ever thought that we &apos;d be saying &quot; poor mona . &quot;
guys .
another one ?
there &apos;s nothing in here . it &apos;s just an empty box .
or maybe not .
for once , i &apos;m right
and you &apos;re wrong , spencer .
how did you just do that ?
took home first prize for my magic act
at performing arts camp .
of course you did .
&quot; watch me make a girl disappear . kisses , a &quot;
it &apos;s magic .
what ?
&quot; watch me make a girl disappear . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; is not playing a game , she &apos;s putting on a magic show .
why would cece do that ?
people wanna go to magic shows to be deceived .
they wanna believe in something they know can &apos;t be true .
wait , so if &quot; a &quot; is putting on a magic show
and we &apos;re the audience ...
no , we &apos;re not the audience .
i think we &apos;re a part of her act .
and she &apos;s gonna make mona disappear forever .
was it all quiet here last night ?
yeah , a little too quiet .
hanna &apos;s convinced this is &quot; a , &quot;
but it smells like mona to me .
if she was missing , don &apos;t you think that
her parents would call the police ?
or maybe they don &apos;t know .
it looks like they &apos;re out of town .
i swear , if i find out that this is her jerking us around ,
i &apos;m gonna kill her myself .
did you get any sleep ?
dozed off for a few minutes after hanna left .
well , go home .
i &apos;ll call you if she shows up .
okay . thanks .
i get the magic eight ball connection ,
but i don &apos;t understand the saw .
well , it &apos;s debatable , but most people give credit to torrini
for being the first illusionist to saw a woman in two .
and when i saw chriss angel do it ,
the top half of the woman crawled away .
it was totally twisted ,
but it turned out that he just used this woman
with sacral agenesis , which is this congenital--
okay , can you just stop talking , please ?
yeah .
okay .
nope . try again .
i don &apos;t know . i mean , is there
a magic shop in town that we don &apos;t know about ?
nothing .
no , no , no , click here .
&quot; the great charlemagne . &quot;
鸦林镇公园 仅限今日
he &apos;s putting on a show in ravenswood this afternoon .
ravenswood ? that can &apos;t be a coincidence .
spence , you &apos;re driving .
we &apos;re still heading east .
i &apos;ll stay on her tail .
just be careful , okay ?
i love you .
toby says that shana &apos;s driving jenna &apos;s car .
is mona with her ?
no , nobody &apos;s with her .
so where &apos;s she going ?
he thought that they were coming here ,
but they just passed the exit .
guys ...
it &apos;s this way . over here .
well , if &quot; a &quot; wanted us to watch
him make a girl disappear , we &apos;re right on time .
i think we &apos;re being watched .
let &apos;s all stick together .
wh-- me ? no way .
you have to .
you can &apos;t resist .
really , i just don &apos;t do boxes .
here , take her . she loves magic .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s going away .
i know this trick . you &apos;ll be okay .
wait , where &apos;d she go ?
just wait a second .
that was great !
where &apos;s emily ?
亲亲贱人们 -a
&quot; lager dee main &quot; ?
lager dee main . &quot; slight of hand . &quot;
while we were watching you ,
&quot; a &quot; took emily .

i don &apos;t know where i am !
look around you . what do you see ?
nothing ! it &apos;s dark !
we &apos;re gonna find you , i promise .
you just have to help us out .
i think i &apos;m locked in a coffin !
it &apos;s a saw ! i hear a saw !
like a chainsaw ?
no ! it &apos;s big and loud !
it &apos;s cutting wood !
like a saw mill ?
it &apos;s getting louder ! closer !
grunwald lived on saw mill road .
oh , my god . it &apos;s right here .
we &apos;re practically on top of it .
hold on , em , we &apos;re coming !
emily ? emily !
i &apos;m here ! i &apos;m here !

hold on !
hold on , cece ! hold on .
aria !
hold on !
hold on !
aria , help !
is she ... ?
she fell .
you tried to save her .
look , aria , this is not your fault .
are you sure you &apos;re okay , aria ? did she hurt you ?
we should just call the police .
she &apos;s gone .
god , that bitch has nine lives .
we need to get out of here . now .
i have to show you something . come on .
come on !
i think that the red coat that i was chasing might have been ali .
she waited for me at the door ,
at the corner . she wanted me to follow her .
and this is what ali wanted us to see .
what is this place ?
i think it &apos;s &quot; a &apos;s &quot; lair .
现场神秘音乐会
there &apos;s a timeline for each of us .
all our secrets , private moments--
he &apos;s documenting everything .
what is that ?
that &apos;s how &quot; a &quot; has been watching us .
&quot; a &quot; is monitoring the police ,
watching the streets , our alarm systems .
that &apos;s how &quot; a &quot; is everywhere .
you sure she &apos;s okay with this ?
she doesn &apos;t have a choice .
have a seat .
caleb , it &apos;s not working .
did you hit shift @-@ command when you entered the numbers ?
i did exactly what you told me to do .
i don &apos;t like the idea of you guys being there alone .
and i can &apos;t get into that computer from here .
well , i &apos;m not gonna say don &apos;t come .
i &apos;m not waiting for toby . he &apos;s still at the hotel .
mona might be safe , but that doesn &apos;t mean she &apos;s not in on this .
so when will i see you ?
i &apos;ll get on the next bus .
i think i just found a &apos;s bank account .
all right , well , just call me when you &apos;re on the road , okay ?
okay .
bye .
it looks like &quot; a &quot; formed a corporation .
didn &apos;t cece study business at upenn ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t think this is hers .
it looks like she &apos;s just on the payroll .
there are two payments made to cece drake last week .
maybe &quot; a &quot; paid her to dress up as red coat .
yeah , to lead us away from ali .
i think &quot; a &quot; is a guy .
have you guys seen these ?
wait , i was with ali when she bought that shirt .
she said she needed it for a date that night with an older guy .
maybe ian ?
or wren . he &apos;s been hanging out with shana ,
and he &apos;s back with melissa .
no , i don &apos;t think that wren &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
&apos;cause &quot; a &quot; has been watching him . look .
well , i still think that all roads lead back to board shorts .
i mean , the name of the company is shigbee ,
and that was ali &apos;s favorite beach in cape may .
do you think that board shorts
is the one who &apos;s taking these pictures ?
is that who cece &apos;s working for ?
look , this is a letter from ali .
she met this boy in rosewood .
and she lied about her age . he thought that she was 18 .
that trip to the shore
mrs. d. told hanna about ...
ali never planned on inviting us . she was taking him there .
guys ...
&quot; a &quot; hasn &apos;t just been watching us .
i think that he &apos;s been following ali , too .
he has her at the lodge the night of the fire .
it looks like he &apos;s been following her trail to ravenswood .
if ali &apos;s been alive this whole time ,
then whose funeral did we go to ?
okay , that &apos;s creepy .
they &apos;re having a celebration tonight .
yeah , and board shorts thinks that ali is gonna be there .
which means we have to find her first .
it &apos;s a beautiful night for a party ,
but it &apos;s for invited guests only .
how did you know that we were going to--
i &apos;m mrs. grunwald .
we have somewhere we need to be .
i know .
but it &apos;s dangerous for you to go chasing after her .
are you talking about alison ?
the girl you said you never met .
i &apos;m sorry i lied to you .
but i did it to protect her .
from who ?
she was calling me that summer to find out .
in the sorority house , it was you .
she was afraid ,
and she was right to be .
what kind of help could you give her ?
i have a gift of insight .
i was using it to help alison see who was threatening her .
the night she went missing ...
i felt something terrible .
i drove to rosewood ...
and i walked into her backyard .
and she was reaching for life .
her head was bloody .
she was very confused . she was in shock .
i put her in the car and i drove her to the hospital .
i ran in to get help .
when i returned , she was gone .
so you &apos;re saying that ali &apos;s still alive ?
haven &apos;t you all felt it ?
she was never really gone .
have you seen her again ?
seen her ? not since that night .
until she finds who she can trust--
she can trust us .
she knows that .
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure .
why-- why didn &apos;t you just go to the police ?
she doesn &apos;t want to be found .
why are you telling us this now ?
because you need to leave ravenswood .
why ?
you &apos;re being watched .
he &apos;s hoping you &apos;ll lead him to alison .
he &apos;s here .
maybe she &apos;s right . maybe we should just leave .
so we &apos;re supposed to pack it in
just because a soothsayer tells us to ?
i mean , for all we know ,
she could be on &quot; a &quot; s payroll .
she-- she can &apos;t prove that any of that story was true .
ali was calling grunwald
because she believed that she could help her .
yeah , i believe her , too .
she was telling us what we &apos;re thinking , right ?
that ali &apos;s still alive .
no , that &apos;s what a good charlatan does .
she tells you what you wanna believe .
maybe grunwald doesn &apos;t want us to come tonight
because she knows that ali will be there .
and &quot; a &quot; is gonna be looking for her .
we &apos;re crashing a party .
