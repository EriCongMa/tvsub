What's wrong?
Over the past month,
the fourth year associates have called our top clients.
We're worried they're thinking of leaving with them.
Do you have any insight?
We need to leave by the end of the week.
People want to wait for bonuses.
We can't keep fooling the partners.
I gave an interview to the Law Advocate.
What did you say?
I talked about the money,
the $45,000 that you took.
We negotiate an exit package.
Diane gave an interview that exposed the firm to criticism.
We're getting calls from clients.
This is my firm.
It was your firm.
What's this? I asked for the Greenberg deposition from March,
not November. Are you deaf?
You're the paralegal who's good with computers.
Could you help with my laptop in about ten minutes?
Oh, good, I need some help moving boxes
out of Diane's office when you get a chance.
I'll take it.
Hey, Chrissy, how are you?
Okay.
Uh, hey, Alicia, do you have a minute?
Um, not right now. How 'bout in an hour?
Sure.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm just...
It's hard.
I know,
but it's good experience, and you'll make a lot of connections
for when you pass the bar.
I guess.
Chrissy, I'll be right back.
No.
It's all right. I figured out what I want to do.
What do you mean?
Nothing. Everything's good.
We're having trouble downloading files.
You shouldn't be talking here.
Don't worry. Everybody just
thinks we're discussing the Zimbalist depo.
I spent the whole afternoon trying to download files to take with us,
but there's some sort of firewall in the way.
It's David Lee. He's still suspicious that we're leaving.
The clients are coming with us, right? Once they come with us,
Lockhart/Gardner doesn't own the files. The clients do.
Right, but they can delay delivering the files to us.
Once all hell breaks loose,
they're not gonna want to lift a finger for us.
They'll have to. The clients will sue.
So? Lockhart/Gardner will just absorb the suit,
knowing we can't do a good job representing our clients
without their files.
I agree. Hey, we're stealing their clients.
No, no, no. We're not stealing.
We're not stealing.
Either way, they're gonna think we're stealing them.
They're gonna be pissed.
All right, all right. So what do we do?
Well... partners can get around the firewall.
No.
No, that would be wrong.
You don't have to do all the files, just the new ones.
Diane's cases.
What's this?
The Zimbalist deposition.
I need the paralegal, the brunette one.
Where is she?
I don't know.
She's probably helping Will in Diane's office.
Okay.
Good luck with the Zimbalist deposition.
So, this is surprising.
Hi, Viola. How are you?
I'm good, Will.
And it's always good to see you,
especially in such a triumphant state.
So, what do you need, Viola?
Oh, may I?
You know, Diane and I were great friends in law school.
But we were always in competition, the same jobs,
the same boyfriends, same everything.
So this judgeship is hitting quite hard.
You want one.
That would be nice.
But I feel that her advancement started
when she stole...
actually, you both stole a client from me.
Have you seen that paralegal?
What's her name?
No, I haven't seen her.
Oh. That's why I'm here. Your paralegal.
She's suing you.
Chrissy is suing us?
And Diane. And the firm.
For what?
For a hostile work environment.
That bitch. I can't believe it.
David.
No, that's okay.
There's a lot worse than that in the complaints.
Something, unfortunately,
that might upset Diane's confirmation.
So this is between you and Diane
and we're just collateral damage?
No. This is between a firm and a paralegal,
and we're all just slaves to the facts.
You're getting better.
I'm getting out my aggressions.
It's a turn-on.
来自洛&加律所
Work again?
Go ahead, take it. I'm fine.
No.
Finally, I don't have to take it.
We have to talk about the inauguration.
No, you have to talk about it. I...
What's that mean?
Six days.
Until you leave? Oh.
I'm gonna miss this office.
You sure you want to go?
Okay, Eli. What's the problem?
You told Nora you want the inaugural ball
moved to the governor's mansion
but traditionally it's held at Exposition Hall,
and I'm getting some trouble from the unions.
Wait, what?
You want the inaugural ball moved to the governor's mansion,
but the unions are threatening to strike
if we move it because it's a non-union...
Okay wait, Eli wait.
I never said anything. I don't know what you heard,
but your office called me and asked me
if it would be fine to move the ball to the governor's mansion,
and I told them what I'm telling you: I don't care.
So you...
didn't ask for it to be moved to the governor's mansion?
Does it sound like me to say
want it moved to the governor's mansion?
Nora said that Mrs. Florrick insisted...
And there you go.
I have a partners' meeting.
Good luck.
Nora, is Mrs. Florrick there?
N-No.
The Mrs. Florrick that asked for the inaugural
to be moved to the mansion.
Hello, Mr. Gold. How are you?
Diane.
My God. Look at you.
Fran, Lyle, hi!
It's been forever.
Well, we were in Lyon for the spring.
You look fantastic.
Well, thank you. And this is Kurt.
Good to meet you.
Ah, you must be the lucky gentleman.- Yes.
These are my oldest friends, Francesca and Lyle.
I set them up.
Blind date, right out of law school.
Which reminds me, I heard Viola was in town.
Did you see her?
Viola Walsh? No.
And what have you two been doing today?
You... smell like you've been camping.
That's gunpowder.
We were out shooting this morning.
Guns? Really?
A Smith & Wesson...
Model 29.
Model 29.
Well then, that's a new side of you, Diane.
Oh, sorry. Do you mind?
来自洛&加律所
I have to take this.
Are you a hunter, Mr...
McVeigh.
Oh, McVeigh. Like-like, uh, the other...
like the other McVeigh?
What other?
Uh, the one who, um, uh...
You know, the one... he's dead now. Um, uh...
Nixon?
No, the one who uh, you know...
Blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City?
Yeah.
Will, what's going on?
It's your old friend, Viola Walsh.
She's suing us.
She got one of our paralegals to accuse us.
Well, I don't know what that has to do with me.
You all pushed me out, remember?
She's saying you sexually harassed her.
I... she what?
How's that gonna look to your friends in the Supreme Court?
This is what I say: she slimes us, we slime her.
We got Kalinda on this, find out everything in her past,
everything we can use.
Wait. Who said that I harassed her?
Chrissy Quinn.
She said that you asked her to prostitute herself to a client,
that... Cary showed her how he masturbated
and I asked her how she lost her virginity.
And I tried to rape her. I don't even know who she is.
Do you realize the United States has the highest percentage
of civilian gun ownership...
Slime her-- that's what I say.
This is blackmail. They want a quick settlement.
It's Viola Walsh, Diane.
She's got an issue with your judgeship.
Tell me what you need me to do.
So you don't think Sandy Hook changed anything?
I think that the Second Amendment
keeps everything from being changed.
But did you see those kids' bodies?
Did you see the photos?
What I don't understand is
how your guns could matter more than that.
I didn't say that.
You're making that connec...
So...
How we doing?
Good, I think.
Great.
I think we should, um...
We're meeting some friends, Diane.
Join us. We're almost done.
No, no. We'll-we'll call you.
We'll-we'll arrange lunch some other time.
Okay, say hi to the kids.
Okay.
Stimulating conversation?
Your friends have some strong opinions.
So does my fiance.
You knew that about me.
I did.
If we settle for $2 million,
insurance will cover 40%, but...
we may lose some clients.
No, we fight it.
Then we have to move quick.
So who do we get to represent us?
I'm sorry. I have to hit 10,000 paces
or my Bangle gets mad at me.
We'd like to hire you, Ms. Tascioni.
Actually, we're considering hiring you.
We're being sued by a female paralegal
for being a hostile workplace.
How long has this paralegal worked for you?
Two years. Why?
I don't know.
I keep asking questions until they make sense.
And... who's representing her?
Viola Walsh, a lawyer from L.A.,
but she's opening up offices here.
Is she tall?
A bit. Five-seven?
You're kidding me.
The worry, Ms. Tascioni,
is that we're in a transition period at the firm
and that this suit could be used to hurt us.
So...
you think this suit is about your transition period.
Yes.
Okay. Then we move fast.
Call this tall lawyer's bluff.
Arrange depositions now.
And I'll get your investigator...
um, Kalinda, right?
Right. I'll get her looking into this
paralegal's background.
Slime her before she can slime you.
When can you start?
To the right.
A little to the left.
To the left. Good.
And you can put the seal over there.
So, Jackie,
what are we doing here?
Rearranging. Mm-hmm.
Do you think the seal would look good there?
There? Why not the men's room?
Mr. Gold.
Take it down and put the seal back up in its place.
What are you doing, Mr. Gold?
Putting the state seal back up
and keeping every reporter from asking
if the governorship has gone to Peter's head.
He won, Eli.
It's not wrong to put such a beautiful portrait
in a place of prominence.
Hmm, maybe it's not wrong, Jackie, but it is stupid.
Perhaps you and I should have a little talk, hmm?
Put the seal back!
Yes, sir.
Jackie, you and I have had some...
times together.
We have... over the years.
And we've had some... disagreements along the way.
Not so many.
But now your son is governor,
and any disagreement results in bigger issues,
so we need to stop.
Whenever you want something changed around here,
no matter how small, no matter how insignificant,
you have to ask.
Certainly.
No.
You have to ask me.
Not Peter, not Alicia.
Not the little fairies that sit on your shoulder.
Just me.
He's my son, Eli.
You can't keep me from speaking to my son.
I can, actually.
You don't want to challenge me on this, Jackie.
Not the campaign manager
that got his candidate elected by six points.
I'll talk to Peter.
Do that.
I'll have him call you in 20 minutes.
The call will last exactly four minutes, so,
keep it quick.
Christina Quinn, the paralegal who used to work here--
I need everything that you can find on her.
Dirt?
Yes.
Work history, sexual history.
Anything that would be...
Where do you get your hair done?
Where? Uh, I don't know. Different places.
I wish my hair would behave.
It just flops. Just...
I flop it this way or that way.
You knew this paralegal?
Uh, the one suing us? Yeah.
What do you think of her?
I think she's very... young.
You read her accusations?
Yes.
She accused everybody of improprieties but you.
Yeah, I saw that.
Are her accusations true?
No.
But you're hesitant?
No. I just think some things are open to interpretation.
Do you think sexual harassment is open to interpretation?
No.
Okay, time to walk.
Look at us-- out to save the world.
Who took that?
Viola Walsh, wasn't it?
So, here you are in my apartment
for the first time in five years,
and my guess is that you have something to get off your chest.
Are we that obvious?
A bit. What is it?
How well do you know Kurt?
What?
He disagrees with you about the right to bear arms.
Look, he disagrees with me about that.
I disagree with him.
It's not a stumbling block.
But his views, Diane.
All his views. He supports Sarah Palin.
I know. I can't believe it.
I fell in love with a Palin supporter.
It's not funny, Diane.
Do you see her? She's back on Fox.
Oh, you don't watch Fox.
They show clips on Jon Stewart.
His views on Obama
and secessionism.
Okay, so, what is this, an intervention?
No, it's just...
Issues matter.
I know we're all supposed to disagree and smile
and go home and pretend it's all some big tennis match,
but people end up poorer,
guns end up killing people.
Global warming keeps destroying our...
So, you're saying I shouldn't be happy?
No, what we're saying is,
do you really know who this guy is?
Do you know his religion, his politics?
Thanks for stopping by,
but I actually do have to go to work.
No. Diane, please, just sit and talk.
Fran, Lyle,
if I fell into a life of addiction,
then, please, do intervene, but don't for this.
Not for love.
The best advice you ever gave me,
Diane, when I met Lyle was,
make sure your love can survive outside the bubble.
I give it back to you.
How long have you worked at Lockhart/Gardner?
Shall we say hello first?
Hello.
How long have you worked at lockhart/Gardner?
Two years.
Who hired you?
Alicia... Florrick.
What were your duties?
Paralegal.
Uh, typing up briefs, researching cases,
making copies, that sort of thing.
How did you lose your virginity?
Objection. How is that relevant?
Chrissy charged in her complaint
that Alicia Florrick asked her how she lost her virginity,
so I'm just asking, what was the answer?
I... didn't answer.
Was there anyone else there when she asked you this?
Myself, Cary Agos, our client and six other associates.
And the issue of virginity came up?
Well, it didn't come up.
The lawsuit was about someone selling their virginity online,
and the difference between implied and explicit contract.
In other words, you didn't bring up
the issue of virginity, it was the issue of the lawsuit?
Do you want to take over the questioning?
Sure.
Was virginity the subject of the lawsuit?
Yes.
And how did you come to ask Chrissy
about her loss of virginity?
The other associates were discussing their experiences,
and I saw Chrissy laugh to herself.
I thought she had something she wanted to share,
so I asked her, did she have something to add?
Those were your exact words?
They were.
I can see why you're suing.
Then what happened?
Cary Agos asked me to stay late on the Ginsberg case.
And this was a sexual case, too?
Yes, prostitution.
Lockhart/Gardner just seems
to obsess on these sexual cases.
Is that a question?
No.
It's just an odd observation.
Then what happened
during your late-night work on this case?
Cary showed me how he masturbated.
And how did he show you this?
With his hand?
Uh... his right hand?
And it was just the two of you?
Yes.
And what was being discussed at the time?
A plea bargain.
The State's Attorney offered to sit down with us
and discuss a plea of three years.
And you didn't think much of it?
No. No, I didn't.
So, when Chrissy reported this offer to you, what did you do?
I made a gesture.
A gesture of-of masturbation?
Yes.
And
by this gesture, did you mean...
this is how I masturbate?
No. No.
What did you mean by it?
That it was a pointless exercise.
Strike two.
Maybe... maybe try something other than sex.
Had you ever seen this partner?
Howard Lyman? No.
He's the oldest partner. He only comes in every now and then.
And he sent you an e-mail about a week ago.
Can you read it?
"Chrissy, I need to discuss something with you.
"Please come to my office at 1:00 p.M.,
enter quietly, and sit down at my desk."
And you had no case with him?
That's correct.
And then,
when you got there, what happened?
He took off his pants and exposed himself to me.
We have a problem. Howard Lyman.
Look, I told you.
We're not having the inaugural at the mansion.
We moved it to a union house.
But you won't call off the strike?
That's right.
Why not?
Because your guy supported Scott Walker in Wisconsin.
Oh, come on.
It's a governor in a nearby state.
He had to show some support.
Eli, unions in this country are endangered.
Every time someone comes out in support of Scott Walker...
So you're going to protest our inaugural?
That is blackmail. That is bad faith.
It's not just you, Eli.
We're making a stand across the Midwest.
Don't take it personally.
You told me it was about the mansion.
I got Jackie to back off the mansion,
and now you're saying...
Jackie Florrick?
What? Yes. Why?
How's she doing?
Jackie? She's fine. Why?
Say hello for me, huh?
霍华德·莱曼
So,what do we ask him?
Whether he brought Chrissy here,
and if took his clothes off in front of her.
Howard?
Oh, my God.
What? Huh? What time is it?
1:00.
I don't have a meeting till 2:00.
You have a meeting now. We have a problem.
She came in here.
I didn't ask her to, I didn't invite her in.
But you didn't have your pants or your underwear on?
I always take it off for lunch.
I take a nap.
I get all sweaty on... on my...
you know, bottom half.
And I did not keep her from leaving.
Bitch screamed. I was just offering her some water.
Oh, dear God.
Look, I am the innocent party here.
The girl came in here and tried to...
She, uh... she tried to...
I don't know what she was trying to do.
I was just taking a nap.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
They just got called into the partner's meeting.
Damn it.
It might not be anything.
You need to get those files.
Alicia?
Diane. How are you?
You know, I just got a glimpse
of what my life would look like if I'd never started this firm.
And?
Yeah, I liked it.
I liked it a lot.
Shall we?
I understand your frustration, but it isn't what it seems.
It was a joke.
A prank. That's all.
In what way was it a joke?
Look, we all
knew Lyman slept off his lunch without his pants on.
And we'd sent out some e-mails to some of the paralegals.
Not just the women. It was the men, too.
So you sent this e-mail to Chrissy from Howard's account?
Yes.
Still haven't negotiated my exit package yet.
No.
We've negotiated your package. You just haven't accepted it.
Do you want to talk or not?
Give me my gun control case,
and let me finish out the Sonya Rucker contract,
and I will agree to the terms.
You'll keep your clients in house?
I'll do everything I can.
One more thing.
Indemnify me against this case.
This Howard Lyman thing is B.S.
Good.
Then indemnify me.
Sure.
Whatever you want.
Good luck.
Not with a bang.
What are you doing?
W-What am I...?
The Sonya Rucker contract.
Excuse me?
You're downloading my file.
I couldn't access it.
No, I, um...
I-I think I stumbled...
Alicia, I talked to Will; it's my case.
There's a firewall protecting it.
Look, my mistake.
How'd it go?
Oh, I have to stay a few hours.
Okay, I'll come back.
I want to meet your friends, Kurt,
your best friends.
Why?
Don't you find it odd
that we've been talking about marriage
and I've never met a single one of your friends?
No.
Is this about your friends yesterday?
Do you remember their names?
No.
Is that important?
I want to meet your friends.
Uh, before Lockhart/Gardner,
you worked at Hoffman/Ross.
Is that correct?
Yes, why?
And did you ever make an accusation against your boss there?
What, is this a fishing expedition?
It is.
Luckily it's a deposition.
Did you ever make an accusation against your boss there, Chrissy?
'Cause we have the texts on your Lockhart/ Gardner cell phone.
How very NSA of you.
It's our cell phones, our property.
Did you ever make an accusation against your previous boss?
Not an official accusation.
How about an unofficial one?
He came on to me.
Yes, you accused him of taking off his clothes in your presence.
Okay, that is so dirty.
I'm just saying...
You are trying...
to make a connection
It's quite a coincidence that all these
between two completely unrelated...
bosses want to take their pants off.
So, we got rid of most of the charges
and we lucked into something
that neutralized the Howard Lyman threat.
Thank you, Kalinda.
But, uh, we still have two issues.
Do you mind if I eat? I missed lunch.
Please.
Two problems-- well, three.
Chrissy's suggesting that you, Diane, prostituted her out.
I have no idea what she's talking about.
And that you, Will, created a hostile workplace
by sleeping with underlings in your office.
I can answer that.
Have you noticed,
I'm the only one in the clear here?
Now here comes the third problem. Kalinda.
I found this saved onto Howard Lyman's I.T. File.
It's from his laptop.
Hey, why don't you come over here
and sit on Daddy's lap, huh, honey?
Oh, dear God.
Who is that?
Another paralegal-- Lacey Atkins.
Hired last year.
This should have no impact on this lawsuit.
The fact that he approached another paralegal has
marginal bearing on this case.
Or you can tell yourselves that.
Thanks, Diane.
So we bury it
and get rid of Howard.
Uh, Will.
I was looking into the partner decorating stipends.
About a month ago,
Alicia stopped decorating her office.
Did you ask her to stop?
No, why?
I don't know.
I just found it odd.
Lift.
Think of the ball as your grandkids.
There you go.
And up...
I'm sorry, Jackie.
What are you sorry for, Mr. Gold?
You made yourself very clear.
Beth, I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm sorry because I've had a change of heart.
I find...
I need your help.
My help?
No, no, there's too much chance of disagreement between us.
Jackie, I'm apologizing.
And I'm telling you,
you have no reason to apologize.
You were right and I was wrong.
And what do you say we dance? So, forward.
Two, three, and go back.
Really feel it in the arms.
Okay, what do you want?
Control of the inauguration.
Really?
All right, and...
Control of the ball.
And decorating of Peter's offices.
And forward...
Agreed.
Good.
What kind of assistance do you need?
You know the Food Service Union chief?
No, who's that?
Ronald Erickson.
Oh, yes, Ronnie.
How is he?
This is his number.
Excellent, excellent.
Give him a call.
And one more time.
Forward.
I like Diane a lot.
I wanted to be like her.
And you went to her
with this client's undue attention
because you liked her?
Yes.
I know Mr. Gainsborough is one of her top clients,
but I told her what he said.
That you looked hot?
Yes, and that he kept watching me
and asked me my bra size.
And what did Diane say?
She said,
"Don't worry about it.
He meant it as a compliment."
That's when I lost my respect for her.
Yes, I can understand that.
Chrissy never mentioned she was uncomfortable
with Mr. Gainsborough's comment.
Yes, but she came to you,
Ms. Lockhart, and told you what he said?
Yes.
And you told her to take it as a compliment
and let it go?
Yes.
Comments about being hot,
questions about bra size-- these are compliments?
From a gay fashion designer, they are.
So you're saying that, um...
Strike that.
you didn't know...
Chrissy didn't know that Mr. Gainsborough was gay,
did she?
I don't know, I thought she did.
She knew he was a fashion designer.
Really, so now you're saying
that paralegals should stereotype
fashion designers or, or anyone
who they deem to be someone that might not fit into a...
You're in a hole,
Ms. Walsh, best to stop digging.
$1 million.
No.
Oh, come on,
it's not going away.
Pay us $1 million and it's over.
Viola,
you're losing, you're losing badly.
We'll make you this deal.
Stop right now and we won't countersue you
for filing a frivolous lawsuit.
We still have you in your office
conducting sexual relations with underlings.
Oh, I forgot.
Here is an affidavit from Mr. Gardner and Tammy Linnata.
They swear they...
...they only had sexual relations once in his office,
and she was never in the employ of Lockhart/ Gardner,
so she was not an underling.
And this is the only time you've ever had sex in your office?
It is.
Will.
That wasn't true--
what you just said.
What?
That wasn't the only time you had sex in your office.
You don't remember?
No, I-I mean, I-I-I-I do,
uh, but it was...
We didn't have sex.
Are, are we defining sex more restrictively?
Because, as I remember it...
I don't think we want that to get out.
I agree,
but your affidavit could prove problematic
because, at the point in time we're talking about,
I was an underling.
Wait.
We did it in there, didn't we?
Technically that's not my office.
That's my bathroom.
Chrissy did only say in your office, didn't she?
Yes, sex in my office,
so we didn't have sex in my office.
Good... good.
Thanks.
Thanks.
That was weird, wasn't it?
Talking about two years ago?
Yeah, that'll be on my mind for the rest of the day.
Just the rest of the day?
Uh, we have another problem.
Viola wants to open the Howard Lyman charge again.
They're crucifying me.
It's like McCarthyism all over again.
反共以及迫害民主进步力量的法西斯行径
Why, what does she have?
She just e-mailed it to me.
Hey, why don't you come over here
and sit on Daddy's lap, huh, honey?
That's a lie.
Where'd this come from?
You taped it, you moron.
It's the same one you showed us?
Yes, the one we were going to keep private.
How did they get it?
I don't know,
but the worry is, they did.
Someone's feeding them our dirty laundry?
Yes, now, the question is who?
So I shouldn't bring up Obama?
Bring up anything you want.
Your friends are gonna hate me, aren't they?
I don't want this to poison us, Kurt.
Well, let's go then. We don't need to do this.
No, no, no, no. Now, I'm-I'm curious.
Let's meet your friends.
Jeannie?
Kurt, there you are. How you doing?
And this must be Diane.
We're the fire-breathing crazies.
Oh, that went well, hmm?
Yup.
You didn't like 'em?
You mean Jeannie and Bobbie and Tonya, the skateboarder?
Why wouldn't I like them?
She's a snowboarder.
And how did you meet them?
In class.
Oh, in class.
And this class is all women?
You didn't like that they were women?
No, I'm fine with the fact that they were all women.
It's just, they were all in their twenties.
They are all excellent terminal ballistic experts.
Have you slept with any of those ballistic experts?
No.
Why are we getting married, Kurt?
Do you not want to?
I don't know.
Ronnie?
Mrs. Florrick.
What is this "Mrs. Florrick" that's new.
Jackie. I'm intimidated now.
You're the governor's wife. Mom, I mean.
I'm still good old Jackie-o.
Do you remember that time on Georgie's boat?
Yes, very well. Do you?
We were a lot younger.
We weren't that much younger.
I've gone grey.
Grey suits you.
Janice will be thrilled that I ran into you.
Yes.
She wouldn't mind if I took old Ronnie out
for a drink, would she?
It's been such a long time.
You got a problem.
Just one?
Someone in our firm
is feeding evidence to Viola Walsh so she can attack us.
I've been asked to find out who.
And?
It's one of your rebels.
How do you know?
Because he left a lot of fingerprints
on an e-mail he sent to Viola.
Kalinda, do me a favor.
I just did you a favor.
Do me another.
I have to tell Will.
I know. Give me an hour head start.
You have 30 minutes.
What were you thinking, Tony?
I was thinking what we were all thinking.
We need clients. We need...
You don't sabotage your own firm.
Lockhart/Gardner isn't my firm. Florrick/Agos is.
It's so dumb! They could sue us!
They're gonna fire you in about ten minutes.
We need you to go along with it. Don't say anything.
So, I get fired, I lose my bonus.
I'm out $30,000.
Well, you shouldn't have gotten caught!
No, we should share our bonuses.
There's no reason I should suffer for helping out the whole team.
Oh, helping out the whole team.
It was your idea in the first place.
All right, then why should I stay silent when they fire me?
So you're threatening us?
No, I'm telling you.
We all shared the start-up costs.
We should share the bonuses.
What do you think?
I think we've got the mafia here.
We've been moving software to pay-per-use
and had a massive uptick.
But you know. You're our lawyer.
So you're happy with the firm?
Lockhart/Gardner?
Yes.
I mean, you're not thinking of leaving?
Well, I've been hearing rumors that you're leaving
for a judgeship, and if that's the case,
we might look around, yeah.
Why?
Has anyone approached you about joining another firm?
A new firm?
Just the usual calls, you know.
But some of our lawyers have approached you, right?
I mean, it's all right. They... they've talked to me.
I don't think I'm supposed to say anything until it's official.
No, I understand.
Alicia already told me that, uh,
she's taking you on, so, I'm fine.
Really?
Because a firm with the governor's wife on the letterhead
is hard to pass up.
Diane?
Yes, good.
Did I say something?
No, no. It's just, um...
I-I have to go. I'll call you later.
Yes! I don't know how you did it.
In fact, I don't think I want to know,
but the union has backed off.
They're not going to strike the inaugural.
I'm so happy, Eli. Oh, a little higher.
Higher.
So we're putting Peter back up again?
Yes. He looks wonderful, don't you think?
And the seal?
I don't know.
Do you have a suggestion?
No. Wherever you want.
How about in your office?
Oh, congratulations.
Congratulations.
You got stood up, huh?
Not sure yet.
Hey, I got a sister you can marry.
I'm fine, thanks.
Sorry.
No.
We're good?
Always.
You know we don't have to do this.
I know.
Get a room.
You have to pay our legal fees,
and we will forgive and forget this.
Really?
Well, I wasn't keeping score,
but I thought the last time I checked, I was ahead.
We just have one more witness.
And was it surprising to you
that Chrissy accused everybody at the firm but you?
No.
It wasn't?
And why is that?
Well, she liked me.
And in what way did she... like you?
In a lot of ways.
And where did she... like you most?
In the copy room, in the pantry,
and sometimes in the bullpen at night.
So, at work?
Yeah.
But Chrissy said she was offended
by all the sexual activity at work.
I know. Odd.
Thank you, Kalinda.
Your witness.
Okay, let me talk to my client.
Lockhart/Gardner. How may I direct your call?
Yes. Yes, she is.
30 minutes?
I am so sorry I'm late.
Please, my office is this way.
Missing it already?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you had gone.
We're settling with Chrissy.
The compromise.
Joely, could you give me a minute?
Oh, sure. Sure. I'll be right out here.
Stability.
What?
Alicia's leaving the firm with Cary,
and she's taking our top clients.
