gather close that you might hearken the story of fat neil .
born stout of heart , but large of bone ,
his adolescent years were shadowed by scorn and mockery .
hey , fatty , fatty .
hey , fatty , fatty .
outlets of fantasy afforded him
some escape from the darkness throughout high school .
and as a man , he traveled far to a new school
and a new beginning ...
or so he thought .
oh , they &apos;re down there by fat neil .
that &apos;s fat neil .
the name became a joke .
i &apos;ll have what fat neil &apos;s having .
the joke became his life .
yes , fat neil .
and neil fell again into darkness ,
only this time , his thoughts turned to an escape
of which we dare not speak .
but pain need not be spoken to be known ,
not to all .
it was , strangely , jeff the liar ,
son of william the barely known ,
who first became concerned .
neil .
it was jeff who pretended to be interested in dungeons &amp; dragons
in an effort to lift neil &apos;s spirits .
and when jeff &apos;s fake interest
resulted in neil giving jeff all his books ,
explaining he wouldn &apos;t need them anymore ...
it was annie the dayplanner ,
herself a recovering head case ,
that recognized the signs of coming doom .
a council was called .
troy the obtuse ...
shirley the cloying ,
abed the undiagnosable ...
julian assange is a modern day ...
and britta the needlessly defiant .
for reasons that should be obvious ,
pierce the insensitive ,
known also as pierce the dickish
and grandpa the flatulent ,
was not invited .
the group agreed that what fat neil needed most
was to feel like a winner for a change .
they would invite neil that saturday
to a game of dungeons &amp; dragons ,
designed by abed to help neil reclaim his confidence .
for neil .
at the end of the meeting ,
they realized that chang had been there
and felt too awkward to mention it .
what they couldn &apos;t have known
was that they had just scheduled
the most important game of dungeons &amp; dragons ever ,
a game which not only might save a life ,
but which would forever change the balance
between good and pierce .
第二季 第十四集
hi .
hey , neil ,
this is gonna be awesome , yo .
so we &apos;re just gonna ignore that hate crime , huh ?
i &apos;m a dark elf , or a trau .
shouldn &apos;t you be wearing armor or something ?
i &apos;m an elf , not a nerd .
so you guys suddenly just wanted to play dungeons &amp; dragons ?
y @-@ yeah .
w @-@ why wouldn &apos;t we ?
yes .
it &apos;s cool , and when you play it ,
it makes you happy ...
like a dragon .
okay , hi .
i am your dungeon master .
we will be playing this adventure--
&quot; the cavern of draconis . &quot;
neil .
i understand neil has his own character
named duquesne that he &apos;s been playing for years ,
so i made these for you guys .
now , take your time . choose your character carefully .
they each have their own unique combination of strength and ...
all righty .
shouldn &apos;t there be a board or some pieces
or something to jenga ?
no , no , this is a role @-@ playing game .
it takes place entirely in our collective imagination .
neil .
i tell a story ,
and you make choices in the story , okay ?
let &apos;s begin .
you are all standing on a country road .
legend has it the evil dragon draconis
dwells nearby , guarding a massive pile of treasure .
working as a team ,
your goal is to track down the dragon , kill him ,
and then claim the treasure as your own .
jeff , your turn .
oh , it &apos;s my turn ?
oh , um ... what do i do--roll dice ?
you tell me what you want to do ,
then i roll the dice to see if you &apos;re successful .
what are my choices ?
okay , you &apos;re slowing things down , jeff .
shirley , what do you want to do ?
i &apos;d like to introduce myself to the group .
hello . i am a dwarf named zippity @-@ do .
okay , i &apos;m not the best at making up names .
oh , hey . i &apos;m marrrrrr .
boy , you weren &apos;t kidding .
hello , marrrrrr .
my name is bing bong the archer .
i &apos;m an archer and such .
i &apos;m ... ew ! hector the well @-@ endowed ? abed .
i didn &apos;t know you &apos;d just grab one at random .
i made that one with troy in mind .
yeah , i bet you did .
okay , hi ! i &apos;m lavernica .
i have three armors ,
boots ,
a belt ,
a torch ....
wait , let her finish .
worst introduction ever . check it .
i am brutalitops ,
the magician !
magic user , baby-- what ?
an arrow flies through the air almost hitting brutalitops .
six goblins are running toward you
from the tree line , drawing daggers .
i attack them using my ... additional notes .
it has no effect . britta ?
i want to know why these goblins are attacking us .
maybe these woods are their rightful land ,
and from their perspective--
you &apos;re the at &amp; t of people .
you &apos;ve been shot by an arrow .
yeah , it hurts . jeff .
uh , i take my throwing knife
and throw it , knife @-@ style .
you do ten points of damage .
look at that .
what am i not good at ?
sex .
but the goblins close in , surrounding you on all sides .
i draw my plus @-@ three sword of duquesne
and attack in a 180 @-@ degree arc .
the goblins are terrified as duquesne draws
his powerful glowing sword from its sheath ...
and in one move , slices the throats
of three charging goblins !
oh , that &apos;s good .
the rest of the goblins run away .
great job with the sword , neil--you saved us .
what would we have done if you didn &apos;t exist ?
dial it back , lavernca .
pierce , what are you doing here ?
how about you answer that question ?
what the hell is this little tea party ?
we &apos;re playing dungeons &amp; dragons .
first of all , gay .
second of all , stupid .
and thirdly ...
why was this a secret ?
are you cutting me out of the group ?
i guess we must have forgot .
yeah , that &apos;s what it was .
but you remembered to invite al jolson here .
20年代美国流行白人涂黑脸扮黑人说唱幽默曲调
and you remembered to let fatty sit in my chair .
get out ! you &apos;re stretching it !
pierce , can we talk to you outside for a second ?
kind of missed that opportunity already , didn &apos;t you ?
yeah , but there &apos;s a very specific reason .
let &apos;s just play , all right ?
i don &apos;t have a character for you .
i don &apos;t care , i just want to play the game .
i don &apos;t need a character .
i think you do .
just put me in the stupid game now .
okay , um ...
as you watch the goblins retreat ,
you notice a 67 @-@ year @-@ old naked man with no weapons ,
lying in the wet grass , shivering .
his name is ...
pierce hawthorne , and i &apos;m 66 , dick .
in about 13 turns , he will die of exposure .
jeff ?
i wait 14 turns .
screw you guys . i &apos;m gonna win .
i go to the naked man , and i give him my cloak .
pierce , i am duquesne of clan duquesne .
dumb name .
i &apos;m gonna take his sword . can i take his sword ?
you &apos;ve got his sword .
pierce , knock it off .
you &apos;re playing the game wrong .
we &apos;ll see .
okay , i take the duquesne sword from the naked man .
i attack him ! i attack black face !
it &apos;s a critical hit .
you &apos;ve decapitated him . brutalitops is dead .
what ?
no !
chang ...
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m gonna have to ask for your character sheet .
still your turn .
i run .
what ? you run ?
the naked man is running into the woods .
but he has my sword .
can we catch him , please ?
well , the cloak that duquesne gave him
was an elven cloak of windwalking ,
which is double speed , so , no . he &apos;s gone .
damn it !
it took me ten years
and 50 campaigns to get that sword .
really ?
maybe i &apos;ll wipe my ass with it
and throw it off a cliff .
that &apos;s for sitting in my chair , fatty .
i take it that means i &apos;m winning .
pierce , you &apos;ve made your point .
you can ruin anything .
now come back and give neil his sword .
i can &apos;t hear you over the sound
of me rubbing his sword on my balls .
pierce !
ew !
you have ...
successfully rubbed your balls on the sword .
abed , don &apos;t help him .
you &apos;re the dungeon master . just kill pierce
and give neil back his sword-- he &apos;s upset .
i &apos;m the dungeon master-- i have to be impartial ,
or the game has no meaning .
can you just give neil a new sword ?
that sword is one of a kind . it was forged by my ancestors .
i hump it .
that &apos;s it . pierce , abed ,
i need a talk with you in the hall ?
what ? hey ...
hey !
that kid in there
is severely depressed .
oh , yeah , is that what he told you ?
from the looks of it , he &apos;s been using that line
since he was five years old to get an extra slice of pie .
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i don &apos;t like being excluded , jeff !
do you ?
yes !
now , go in there and tell him you &apos;re giving him his sword ,
or you are out of the study group .
i &apos;m sick of you threatening me
and talking to me like a kid
and giving me that look you give me
like i can &apos;t get erections !
what ?
abed , i keep running .
okay .
but since you &apos;re working against the group ,
i need to separate you from them .
good . who wants to sit
with a bunch of fat crybabies anyway ?
call me when you &apos;re ready for my next move .
pierce refuses to give back the sword .
our new goal is to find him and kill him .
i think i just want to go home .
neil , do not do that .
we &apos;re gonna get that sword back , okay ?
now , is there a way of moving faster than he &apos;s moving
in his cape of whatever ?
i guess if we had a pegasus .
if that &apos;s sarcasm , i can &apos;t tell ,
because everything in this game is silly .
um , abed , can we get a pegasus ?
i can &apos;t give you information like that .
well , there &apos;s got to be a town nearby .
we will go to that town and ask around ...
about a pegasus !
huzzah !
is that right ?
and so it was that the group
began to describe themselves walking .
and as they described themselves walking ,
so did abed confirm that they walked ...
i walk with them .
until ...
this is a local elf tavern , but all races are welcome .
okay , it &apos;s a crowded and rowdy evening .
beleaguered gnomes hurry to and fro
with glasses of mead for the thirsty elves .
beleaguered ? why are they beleaguered ?
who cares ?
i find a waiter and introduce myself .
argy bargy arg barg barg .
why is he a pirate ?
he &apos;s a gnome .
he only speaks gnome .
anybody here speak gnome ?
oh ! i do ! lavernica does .
oh , this &apos;ll be painless .
hello , my friend and brother .
how can i help you , dear madam ?
oh , please , no need for such deference .
i am no better than a gnome .
yes , you are , madam .
you are a human warrior ,
which is five species classes greater than i.
that &apos;s disgusting . don &apos;t talk like that .
i am so sorry , madam !
please don &apos;t report me for execution !
oh , no , no , no ! i didn &apos;t mean that .
guys , we have got to do something about these gnomes .
britta , ask the stupid gnome
where we can get a pegasus !
did someone say &quot; pegasus &quot; ?
a word i understand in every language ?
okay , here &apos;s all the dungeons &amp; dragons stuff i could find .
i had to carry it all the way from my car .
it &apos;s very heavy , and my doctor said ...
following the directions
given to you by the gnome , you arrive at a field
full of majestic pegasi .
finally .
but they are guarded by a mysterious and beautiful elf maiden ,
who seems drawn to marrrrrr .
oh . okay . well , i explain that we need a pegasus ,
and , uh , i don &apos;t know ,
promise to fill it up before we bring it back .
she flirts with you .
i flirt back .
how ?
i say something sexy .
like what ?
abed .
excuse me , i don &apos;t normally do this ,
but you &apos;re the most beautiful creature i &apos;ve ever seen ,
and i would really love a pegasus .
works for me .
you &apos;re very handsome , you know .
well , you know , i &apos;m not really comfortable with this .
my stable has a bedding of heather .
perhaps you &apos;d be more comfortable indoors .
abed , try to look at what you &apos;re doing
and understand that i don &apos;t want to .
you &apos;ve offended the elf maiden .
she seems disinterested in doing business with you today .
what ?
all right , come on , can we just do this ?
hi . hello . i am hector the well @-@ endowed .
you &apos;ve got a bunch of pegasi . let &apos;s make a deal .
what kind of deal ?
all right , i take her by the hand
and lead her to the stable .
i light a candle and rip off a piece of my tunic ,
which i fashion into a blindfold .
oh , hector , but i don &apos;t know--
i place it gently over the elf maiden &apos;s eyes .
okay . you both fall back , exhausted but still entwined .
okay , great . i stroke her hair lovingly
and spoon her for the appropriate amount of time
before leaving .
how long is that ?
cool , cool , cool .
all right , the elf maiden , thoroughly satisfied ,
promises you a flock of pegasi .
oh , excellent .
you guys can take a break . i should check on pierce .
pierce ?
i &apos;m here .
i need to know what you want to do next .
so many things , abed ...
so many things .
guys ...
i am bringing pierce back into the room ,
because while soaring above the forest of ingold ,
you spot his body in an elven cloak in a clearing below .
we got you , dummy !
we land .
you land safely in the wooded clearing .
he is facedown , barely moving ,
a pool of blood underneath him .
i can &apos;t tell you how long
i &apos;ve dreamed of this moment ... in the game .
uh , neil &apos;s sword ?
clutched in the right hand of the body
is the sword of duquesne .
sir , i believe this is yours .
thank you , jeff .
once you get close enough to take the sword ,
you can see that this body ,
while definitely dying , is not pierce .
what ?
i turn it over .
it &apos;s the gnome waiter from the tavern .
what ? no . why ?
good @-@ bye , my friend .
thank you for being so respectful toward me .
who did this to you , gnome waiter ?
i never saw his face .
just so you know ...
my name ...
was kyle .
kyle .
britta ?
he was an imaginary waiter .
i wouldn &apos;t expect you to understand .
now .
you hear a low rumble on the other side of the tree line ,
followed by a shrill screech
and the beating of heavy wings against the sky .
wait , wings ?
what &apos;s going on ?
tell me , abed , are you familiar
with the amburg region of the edylmann river basin ?
of course i am .
then you &apos;ll know there &apos;s a reflecting pool
with a very special amulet at the bottom of it--
an amulet that allows the wearer
full control over ...
draconis !
the hideous draconis ,
an all @-@ powerful red dragon ,
crashes through the trees into the clearing .
riding atop his shoulders ,
naked as the day he was born ,
and controlling draconis with the amulet is ...
say it !
pierce hawthorne .
scream what i told you to scream !
pierce hawthorne is my master !
prepare to meet your doom !
i run towards pierce with my broadsword drawn ,
and i attack his-- - time stop !
&quot; time stop &quot; ?
draconis has tons of spells .
the six of you are completely frozen and helpless .
this is why i wanted to play chutes and ladders .
fine , pierce . you win .
just kill us and end this .
oh , no , killing &apos;s too good for you .
cast &quot; shape change &quot; on duquesne .
what shape do you choose for him ?
fat .
pierce , stop it !
pierce !
duquesne starts gaining weight .
how much ?
make him as fat as fat neil .
pierce !
oh , right , cry .
let it out .
baste your chubby cheeks in tears of gravy .
you weren &apos;t crying when you were stealing my friends .
they asked me to come here .
you know why , right ?
i &apos;ve got some fat news for you , fat neil .
don &apos;t you know why jeff winger , of all people ,
led the charge on the &quot; fat neil feel good &quot; committee ?
way over the line , pierce !
i &apos;ll tell you why .
because i was there .
oh , they &apos;re down there by fat neil .
that &apos;s right , neil .
your new best friend , jeff winger ,
coined the name &quot; fat neil . &quot;
jeffrey !
look , before you respond , i can make it up to you .
i &apos;ll find a fatter neil .
huzzah .
you made up &quot; fat neil &quot; ?
someone asked me where the restrooms were ,
and you were standing by them ,
but you were also standing kind of near , uh , other neil .
so call him skinny neil .
he &apos;s actually not that skinny .
he &apos;s bald ! he &apos;s black !
well , i don &apos;t look at the world through that lens .
i &apos;m sorry . i shouldn &apos;t be high @-@ roading you .
i &apos;m the bad guy .
now you can all hang out in suspended humiliation
and think about what you learned today .
one , don &apos;t screw with me .
two , invite me to your crap .
is it my turn ?
yes , but you can &apos;t move .
that &apos;s fine .
for my turn , i feel sorry for pierce hawthorne .
save it .
no , i really do , man .
good .
for my turn , i rape the duquesne family ...
again .
jeez .
for my turn , i pity pierce too .
trust me , kitten , i &apos;m having the time of my life .
i won .
i won dungeons &amp; dragons , and it was advanced .
i pity pierce .
knock it off .
yeah , you really outdid yourself this week .
there &apos;s a lot of pain in you . i seriously feel bad .
feel sorry for your new fat bff .
no , we &apos;re done doing that .
he &apos;s gonna be fine , aren &apos;t you , neil ?
you , pierce , i really worry about ,
at least for my turn , anyway .
well , how about this ?
draconis , unfreeze time .
done . you guys can move again .
i breathe so much fire on you--
hold it . you just used your move unfreezing time .
neil ?
i take the sword of duquesne ,
and i throw it at the amulet around the sad , naked man &apos;s neck .
that &apos;s a difficult shot . you &apos;ll need an 18 or higher .
oh , sweet baby jesus .
yeah !
yes ! in your face !
the sword smashes the amulet ,
freeing draconis from its spell .
the red dragon turns his head ,
grabs pierce in his mighty jaws ,
and swallows him alive .
oh , no !
oh , neil !
as a reward for freeing him ,
he flies your intrepid band to his cavern
where he bestows his treasure upon you .
congratulations on the completion of &quot; cavern of draconis . &quot;
i &apos;ve been your dungeon master .
i hope you had a good time .
whoo !
excelsior .
hey .
that was the best game i ever played in my life .
don &apos;t mention it .
want to play again next week ?
maybe .
okay . i &apos;ll be around .
and so it was that pierce hawthorne
saved the life of fat neil ,
while learning very , very little .
good night .
how could you possibly want giant ears over a tail ?
if you had a tail , people could always tell when you &apos;re happy .
yes , but with giant ears , you could hear things from miles away ,
and you could wear backpacks as earrings ,
which would free up your hands .
backpacks already free up your hands .
guys , what do you think ?
we thought our group was meeting now .
tail is much better .
thank you .
all in favor of giant ears ?
