you don &apos;t understand .
for us , kissing is as important as any part .
yeah , right !
you serious ?
oh , yeah .
everything is in that first kiss .
absolutely .
for us , kissing &apos;s an opening act ..
like the comedian you have to sit through ..
before pink floyd comes out .
and it &apos;s not that we don &apos;t like the comedian .
it &apos;s just that that &apos;s not why we bought the ticket .
the problem is , no matter how great the show was ..
you girls are looking for the comedian again .
we &apos;re in the car , fighting traffic , just trying to stay awake .
word of advice : bring back the comedian .
or next time you &apos;ll find yourself listening to that album alone .
are we still talking about sex ?
the one with the sonogram at the end
no , it &apos;s good . it is good .
it &apos;s just that doesn &apos;t she seem a little angry ?
well , she has issues .
does she ?
try to live with &quot; mr. i &apos;m evolving . &quot;
he &apos;s out while she &apos;s home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet .
marsha , see , these are cave people .
okay , they have issues like :
&quot; gee , that glacier &apos;s getting kind of close . &quot;
speaking of issues , isn &apos;t that your ex @-@ wife ?
no .
yes , it is . carol , hi !
okay . yes , it is . i &apos;ll catch up with you in the ice age .
can i stay ?
no .
hi .
hi .
is this a bad time ?
no , it &apos;s ..
the stone age .
you look great . i hate that .
sorry . thanks . you look good too .
well , you know , in here , anyone who ..
stands erect ..
what &apos;s new ? still a
a lesbian ?
you never know . how &apos;s the family ?
marty &apos;s still totally paranoid .
carol , why are you here ?
i &apos;m pregnant .
pregnant .
she didn &apos;t leave in such a hurry after all .
this is the three &apos;s company episode with a misunderstanding .
then i &apos;ve already seen this one .
are you through with that ?
sorry , the swallowing slowed me down .
whose ball of paper is this ?
mine . i wrote a note to myself , then i didn &apos;t need it .
so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead .
she already fluffed that pillow . you already fluffed it &apos;s fine .
i just don &apos;t wanna give them any more ammunition .
parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child &apos;s pillow .
relax , you do this every time . the place looks great .
you got a lasagna here that looks good enough ..
to avoid touching .
monica ? hi !
monica , you &apos;re scaring me .
i mean , you &apos;re all chaotic and twirly , you know ?
not in a good way .
calm down . you don &apos;t see ross getting twirly every time they come .
that &apos;s because my parents think ross can do no wrong .
you see , he &apos;s &quot; the prince . &quot;
they had some big ceremony before i was born .
what ?
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster .
has anybody seen my engagement ring ?
it &apos;s beautiful .
oh , god ! oh , god ! oh , god !
no , don &apos;t touch that .
like i wasn &apos;t dreading tomorrow enough , having to give it back .
&quot; hi , barry , remember me ? i &apos;m the girl that stomped on your heart . &quot;
now i must return the ring without the ring ..
which makes it so much harder .
easy , we &apos;ll find it . won &apos;t we ?
look , it &apos;s gonna be okay . you &apos;ll give it back ..
and we &apos;ll eat ice cream .
okay . it &apos;s a pear @-@ shaped diamond
any diamond ring we find , we &apos;ll run it by you .
when did you have it last ?
doy , right before she lost it .
you don &apos;t get a lot of &quot; doy &quot; these days .
i know i had it this morning .
i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with
dinah ?
oh , don &apos;t be mad .
you didn &apos;t .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
i gave you one job !
but look how straight those noodles are .
that &apos;s not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna .
i just can &apos;t do it .
boys ? we &apos;re going in .
hi .
that is not a happy &quot; hi . &quot;
carol &apos;s pregnant .
i found it !
what ?
yeah .
do that for two hours , you might be where i am about now .
that puts that whole pillow thing in perspective .
how do you fit into this whole thing ?
carol and susan want me to be involved .
but if i &apos;m not comfortable with it , i don &apos;t have to be involved .
it &apos;s totally up to me .
she is so great . i miss her .
what does she mean by &quot; involved &quot; ?
your job is done .
and the most enjoyable .
phoebe , say something .
they want me to go down to this sonogram thing ..
with them tomorrow .
remember when life was simpler ..
and she was just a lesbian ?
those were the days .
what are you gonna do ?
i have no idea .
no matter what i do , i &apos;m still gonna be a father .
this is still ruined , right ?
martha lugwin &apos;s daughter is gonna call you .
what &apos;s that curry taste ?
curry .
i think they &apos;re great . i really do .
the big lugwin had a thing for you .
they all had a thing for him .
oh , mom .
why is this girl going to call me ?
she just graduated , and she wants to be something in cooking or food ..
i told her you have a restaurant
i don &apos;t have , i work in a restaurant .
they don &apos;t have to know that .
ross , help me with the spaghetti .
yes .
oh , we &apos;re having spaghetti . that &apos;s easy .
we were going to have lasagna .
i love lasagna .
we &apos;re not having it .
then why bring it up ? he latches on .
this will sound unbelievably selfish ..
but did you plan to bring up the baby / lesbian thing ?
it might take the heat off of me .
that rachel . we saw her parents at the club .
they were not playing well .
i won &apos;t say what they spent ..
but $ 40,000 is a lot for a wedding .
at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar .
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
nothing .
it &apos;s an expression .
no , it &apos;s not .
don &apos;t listen to her . you &apos;ve always been independent .
even when you were a chubby kid ..
and you had no friends , you were just fine .
you &apos;d read alone in your room . your puzzles ..
people like ross need to shoot for the stars .
with his museum and his published papers .
others are satisfied with staying where they are .
these people never get cancer .
they &apos;re happy with what they have , content ..
like cows .
cows , dad ?
she knows how much i love cows .
i read about women trying to have it all , and i thank god ..
our &quot; harmonica &quot; doesn &apos;t have that problem .
i &apos;m telling you , you &apos;ll be fine .
thank you , daddy .
oh , so this does work .
so , ross , what &apos;s going on with you ?
any stories ? no news , no little anecdotes to share with the folks ?
look , i realize you guys have been wondering ..
what exactly happened between carol and me .
and so , well , here &apos;s the deal .
carol &apos;s a lesbian .
she lives with a woman named susan .
she &apos;s pregnant with my child .
she and susan are going to raise the baby .
and you knew about this ?
folks are really that bad ?
well , you know , these people are pros .
they know what they do .
they take their time . they get the job done .
they say that you can &apos;t change your parents .
boy , if you could , i &apos;d want yours .
must pee .
it &apos;s worse when you &apos;re twins .
you &apos;re a twin ?
we don &apos;t speak .
she &apos;s this high @-@ powered , driven , career @-@ type .
what does she do ?
she &apos;s a waitress .
identical ?
people say we look alike .
but i don &apos;t see it .
you guys , i kind of gotta clean up now .
chandler , as an only child , you don &apos;t have this .
no , although i did have an imaginary friend ..
who my parents preferred .
hit the lights , please .
how long was i in there ?
i &apos;m just cleaning up .
oh , you need any help ?
okay , sure . thanks .
anyway ..
so you nervous about barry tomorrow ?
a little .
a lot .
so , got any advice ?
you know , as someone who &apos;s recently been dumped .
you may wanna steer clear of the word &quot; dumped . &quot;
chances are he &apos;s gonna be this broken shell of a man .
you should try not to look too terrific . i know it &apos;ll be hard .
or i &apos;ll go down there , and i &apos;ll give barry back his ring .
and you can go with carol and susan to the ob @-@ gyn .
you &apos;ve got carol tomorrow .
when did it get so complicated ?
got me .
remember being in high school ?
yeah .
didn &apos;t you think you &apos;d meet someone ..
fall in love , and that &apos;d be it ?
ross ?
yes . yes .
man , i never thought i &apos;d be here .
me neither .
sorry i &apos;m late . i got stuck at work .
there was this big dinosaur thing . anyway ..
hi .
you remember susan .
how could i forget ?
hello , susan . good shake , good shake .
so , we &apos;re just waiting for ?
dr. oberman .
and is he ?
she .
of course , &quot; she . &quot;
is she familiar with our special situation ?
yes , and she &apos;s very supportive .
okay , that &apos;s great .
no , i &apos;m oh .
thanks .
that opens my cervix .
barry ?

the baby grows in a special place inside
thank you .
i mean , how &apos;s this gonna work , you know , with us ?
when important decisions have to be made ?
give me a &quot; for instance . &quot;
well , i don &apos;t know .
how about with the baby &apos;s name ?
marlon .
if it &apos;s a boy . minnie , if it &apos;s a girl .

i believe julia &apos;s on the table ?
sorry about that .

i went with mindy .
mindy ?
my maid of honor , mindy ?
yeah , we &apos;re kind of a thing now .
you got plugs !
careful . they haven &apos;t quite taken yet .
and you got lenses .
you hate sticking your finger in your eye .
not for her .
listen , i really wanted to thank you .
okay .
a month ago , i wanted to hurt you more than i &apos;ve ever wanted to .
and i &apos;m an orthodontist .
you know , you were right . i thought we were happy .
we weren &apos;t happy .
but with mindy ..
now i &apos;m happy .
spit .
what ?
me .
anyway ..
i guess this belongs to you . or maybe some day mindy .
like she &apos;d settle for that .
yeah , that &apos;s true .
but i think it &apos;s a nice ring ..
and thank you for giving it to me .
thank you for giving it back .

helen willick bunch geller ? i think that borders on child abuse .
of course not . i &apos;m suggesting geller willick bunch .

they &apos;ll call her geller . he gets his way .
my way ? you think this is my way ?

oh , my god !
look at that .
i know .
well , isn &apos;t that amazing ?
what are we supposed to be seeing here ?
i don &apos;t know , but i think it &apos;s about to attack the enterprise .
if you tilt your head and relax your eyes ..
it kind of looks like an old potato .
then don &apos;t do that , all right ?
monica , what do you think ?
are you welling up ?
no .
