you good ?
just wondering what we &apos;re walking into ,
you coming strapped so heavy .
i &apos;ve never dealt with this guy remy before .
you just make sure we don &apos;t get ripped off .
i &apos;ll make sure we don &apos;t get gut .
here i was ,
expecting to transact with some bona fide gangsters .
instead , you fools roll in here
asking for the friends and family discount ?
think of it as a &quot; get to know you &quot; discount .
if your product is as good as you say it is ,
we &apos;ll be back for a whole lot more next time .
open your ears , big man .
&apos;cause i &apos;m about to educate you on a little something
called supply and demand .
as in people be demanding my supply .
so why do i got to cut you one break
when i got buyers lining up
to pay full price ?
economies of scale , brother .
low margins , high volume ,
equals more profit .
say instead of this dope here
you was sitting on some toaster ovens .
would you bust your ass selling unit by unit ?
or would you wholesale that inventory
to some established retailer ,
kick back ,
watch that cash roll in ?
head that big ,
i should &apos;ve known you had one brain on you .
so we good at 20 a key ?
we good .
actually , we &apos;re not .
&apos;cause you disrespected my boy .
and i don &apos;t do business with punks .
so , what ? you just gonna walk ?
we &apos;re gonna take the money and the drugs ,
and then we &apos;re gonna walk .
only question is if we &apos;re gonna
smoke your ass on the way out .
all right , levi .
be cool .
i &apos;m sure we can work this out .
no , bro . i don &apos;t think we can .
hpd ! drop your weapons !
get down on the ground now !
take &apos; em away , boys .
all right , turn around .
you did good .
everything goes as planned ,
you &apos;ll be out in a couple of years .
empty the register !
now !
what &apos;s up , levi ?
what &apos;s up , bro ?
been thinking about you . heard you got out .
wasn &apos;t sure if you was coming by , though .
ah , i had to see this for myself .
last i heard , you were working the fry station at blimpie &apos;s ,
hair net and all that .
you &apos;re a legitimate tycoon now .
guess the last 12 years have been good .
after everything went down , i decided to reevaluate .
made some changes .
good . prison gave you perspective .
what &apos;d you end up doing , about two years ?
knocked down from a nickel .
good behavior and whatnot .
and all that time ,
not even a phone call , after everything we been through .
like i said ,
i &apos;m a different person now .
right . i &apos;m back now .
gonna make some moves .
in fact , i &apos;m thinking we should probably talk .
no , levi .
i don &apos;t think we should .
but if you need a job ,
i can hook you up with something .
i strike you as the hair net type ?
exactly .
i &apos;ll be seeing you .
real soon .
you know what your problem is ?
what &apos;s my problem ?
could you just leave me alone ?
leave you alone ?
give me the headphones .
i &apos;ll stop . you know me .
don &apos;t be a child .
why would you start a movie you &apos;re not gonna finish ?
it drives me crazy .
because it beats looking at the back of a headrest
for the entire ...
so why don &apos;t you read a book ?
there &apos;s a magazine .
why don &apos;t you do the crossword puzzle in here ? sudoku ?
you like sudoku ?
i don &apos;t want to do any of those things ,
because what they don &apos;t allow me to do
is put on those headphones and tune you out .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
that &apos;s really nice .
that &apos;s a nice thing to say to your friend , isn &apos;t it ?
and that &apos;s the movie you &apos;re gonna watch ? this is ...
yeah .
are you sure you two don &apos;t want to sit together ?
absolutely not .
ab ...
no . i don &apos;t want to sit next to him
for a number of reasons , uh , the most important being
that i am very claustrophobic .
he is .
i mean , i sit in between two people , with the arms
and the hands and everything .
you touch me , i &apos;ll go completely nuts .
plus , i don &apos;t want to have to , you know , jump over him ,
give him a lap dance if i got to go use the little boys &apos; room .
well , in that case , i think i &apos;ll skip my second chardonnay .
you &apos;re not skipping anything . if you need to use the restroom ,
i will gladly get up and let you pass by .
and i &apos;m sorry we &apos;ve been so disruptive .
we &apos;ve been disruptive ?
no , we haven &apos;t been disruptive .
i &apos;m sitting here trying to watch pitch perfect 2,
and you &apos;re telling me i ain &apos;t doing it right .
okay ? you know , you would think that having
a human being sitting between us would @-@ would serve as a buffer
for the constant criticism , but , no , he keeps going
and going and going and going .
he , uh ... he gets ...
he gets very irritable , very ...
kind of volatile when we travel together .
he &apos;s @-@ he &apos;s antsy because he &apos;s not flying the plane .
well , i can tell this is going to be the longest
45 @-@ minute flight of my life .
i &apos;m steve , by the way .
and the bundle of joy to your right is danny .
alissa .
alissa . that &apos;s a nice name .
nice to meet you , alissa .
how you doing ?
so , uh ... so , alissa , what takes you to maui today ?
just visiting some friends .
that &apos;s nice .
you guys ?
well , it &apos;s a funny story . danny and i are attending
a three @-@ day workshop to focus on our relationship .
our work relationship .
we are officers of the law .
the state of hawaii mandates that
we do 24 hours of therapy every working year ,
and so we packed it into one weekend
and we &apos;re gonna make a , uh ...
a brocation out of it .
brocation ?
brocation . you like that ?
that &apos;s so cute .
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t encourage him , all right ?
if he and i make it through this weekend
without killing each other , it &apos;s a win , so ...
well , if the first ten minutes of this flight are any indication ,
i &apos;m not loving your chances .
it doesn &apos;t make sense .
why would gabriel cut a deal with shioma
just to turn around and kill him ?
because it was all a power play .
he was just biding his time , earning the yakuza &apos;s trust
until he could make his move .
but he wasn &apos;t stopping there .
what do you mean ?
he tried to take out the heads of the triads
and the makauakane family at the title fight last week .
thankfully , we stopped him .
gabriel just took a big swing and missed .
he &apos;s got no one left to align himself with .
what do you think his next move is ?
i don &apos;t know .
but right now i &apos;m more interested in you .
how are you holding up ?
i &apos;m fine , kono .
really . i &apos;m fine .
nothing about this is fine .
yeah , you &apos;re right .
yeah , i just keep ...
reminding myself what &apos;s waiting for me on the other side .
539 more days .
i miss you .
so , what , no abby today ?
no . she had to go back to san francisco for a few days .
so what do we got ?
got a john doe .
couple cliff divers found him here this morning .
looks to be a botched dump job .
maxwell .
care to bring lieutenant kelly up to speed ?
gladly . our victim was killed execution @-@ style ,
courtesy of a single gunshot to the back of the head .
t.o.d. is roughly 12 hours ago .
and prior to that , he was badly beaten ,
as evidenced by the numerous lacerations
and contusions on the body and face .
you any closer to getting an i.d. on him ?
unfortunately not .
the dermis absorbed too much water to run prints ,
so i &apos;ll have to take him back to the lab .
wait a minute , i know this guy .
that &apos;s antone remiel .
went by the name remy .
this guy was supplying drugs to half the dealers on the island ,
including kamekona and his partner levi back in the day .
yeah , that &apos;s him all right .
levi came by last night .
i thought he might have put together
that it was me who rolled on him .
yeah , instead remy ends up dead .
i &apos;m guessing levi blamed him for the sting .
makes sense .
remy set the time and location of the buy .
made us come to him .
and levi , he never cared for him much .
well , that &apos;s because once he got out of prison ,
remy turned his life around .
did you know he was coaching basketball at a community center ?
he also got a girlfriend with a kid on the way .
should have been me .
look ,
if we don &apos;t put levi away and soon ,
more people are gonna die .
and we don &apos;t have any hard evidence linking him to the murder .
if we &apos;re gonna make this case , we need some help .
you asking what i think you &apos;re asking ?
i need you undercover again .
it &apos;s the only way to get to levi .
i &apos;m in .
kamekona .
you can &apos;t be late for school again .
i know , i know .
but baby brother needs his breakfast .
and you , too , moms .
go , before you miss the bus .
step right up folks .
genuine koa wood war clubs ,
hand @-@ carved by the great polynesian warriors of our tribe .
genuine .
start selling , flippa .
genuine war clubs , everybody .
hand @-@ carved .
folks , these one @-@ of @-@ a @-@ kind beauties won &apos;t last long .
how much ?
for you , my friend ? only ten dollars .
all right . thanks .
genuine war clubs .
genuine , bro . get one when the last folks .
hey , kid .
got some muscle in you .
what &apos;s your name ?
kamekona .
i &apos;m levi .
if you &apos;re ever interested in making some real money ,
we should talk .
used to think i had people on the outside .
then i get out and i realize
that most of them aren &apos;t my people anymore .
how about you-- how &apos;s the family ?
moms passed a few years back .
kanoa moved to the mainland when i went away .
haven &apos;t spoken to him since .
but flippa &apos;s still around .
yeah ? he still look like a dolphin ?
bruddah only working for me because seaworld &apos;s not hiring .
make a left over here .
you gonna tell me where we going ?
oh , you &apos;ll know when you see it .
look , i said i &apos;d help you .
and i will .
just as long as it doesn &apos;t end up with us paying a visit to remy .
no , brah .
i don &apos;t got to see remy .
well , not exactly a confession .
all right , this place is crazy . i mean , they got everything .
three pools , two spas , they got a meditation garden .
they got ... they got a pillow menu
and a soap concierge on call .
soap concierge .
soap concierge .
you know , i know how to use soap .
i &apos;ve been using it for 39 years .
i @-@ i don &apos;t think i need any help .
these are handmade artisanal soaps , danny .
they @-@ they formulate them to your ...
to your specific skin type .
you don &apos;t just pass something like that up .
i wish your seal buddies could hear you right now .
all right , i got the whole day planned for us today .
we &apos;re gonna start with nine holes of golf ,
a little stand @-@ up paddleboarding ,
then dinner at the steakhouse .
then you , me , uh , alissa and a buddy
are gonna go for some drinks afterwards .
alissa from the plane ?
yeah . been texting .
wow , i didn &apos;t even see you do that . that &apos;s very nice .
well , you were watching pitch perfect 2 .
you were busy , you know .
well , you know , i @-@ i have a girlfriend ,
so i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna be much use .
why don &apos;t you relax ?
just figured we &apos;d have a couple drinks , hang out . it &apos;d be nice .
no , no , no , you figured that you &apos;d have a better chance
of getting right if you had a wingman .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking .
oh , yeah , thanks . okay , goose .
like i need a wingman .
see that ? you see that ?
very nice .
how &apos;s this place ?
it &apos;s good .
you know , i &apos;m pretty sure that this isn &apos;t spring break , though .
i mean , we probably have to attend these classes or whatever .
relax . we &apos;re gonna put a little face time in ,
then we &apos;ll slip out the back door as soon as we can .
how hard can it be ?
aloha . welcome .
aloha .
are you gentlemen here for the relationship workshop ?
yes , we sure are . i &apos;m steve . this is my partner , danny .
i &apos;m the therapist , loraine .
hi , loraine .
‭ hi .
how &apos;s it going ?
great .
i &apos;ll just ask you to sign in
and to kindly place your cell phones
in the box you see right there .
i &apos;m sorry ?
it &apos;s this rule i have .
we &apos;re about to take a deep
spiritual journey into the inner world that
you two share ,
and we can &apos;t have any distractions .
let &apos;s see . what @-@ what ... what is this , loraine ?
oh , that &apos;s an itinerary
for the subjects we &apos;ll be covering this week .
&apos;cause it says &quot; overcoming sexual incompatibility . &quot;
sex is a vital component for a loving relationship .
you , uh , you signed us up for couples therapy .
this is fine . we can work with this .
this is fine .
it &apos;s gonna be great .
right here .
here we are .
just like the old days .
can i help you with something , big boy ?
this is from levi .
you still in ?
rent &apos;s due , and we both know
your mom can &apos;t cover it herself .
zeke &apos;s been holding onto something for me for the last few years .
i &apos;d go in and get it myself , but ...
if i &apos;m even seen in a place like this ,
my p.o. will be all over my ass .
and here i thought i was just giving you a ride .
help you with something ?
i &apos;m here to see zeke .
hold up . i got to check you first .
if they find that wire , he &apos;s dead .
you done yet ?
why-- you hiding something ?
chin , we got to get him out of there right now .
he &apos;s right , chin .
wait , wait .
not yet .
bruddah , you gettin &apos; too liberal with your hands .
i ain &apos;t packing .
and i don &apos;t need a piece to put you down , brah .
he &apos;s good .
well , if it ain &apos;t big boy himself .
so what brings you back after all these years ?
there &apos;s got to be 50k in there , easy .
enough to keep you on your feet
until you figure out your next play .
brah , i owe some bad dudes a lot of money .
this ain &apos;t even a drop in the bucket .
how bad ?
i don &apos;t come up with 300 large in the next 24 hours ,
lights out .
can you help me ?
he &apos;s lying . there is no debt .
he just wants to use me to put together some quick cash
for some drug buy .
that &apos;s what levi does-- gets people to do his dirt .
well , now , you &apos;re probably right .
but that doesn &apos;t change our objective here ,
so let &apos;s just take a breath and figure this out .
all right , so we just heard from hpd .
they &apos;ve been piecing together levi &apos;s whereabouts
for the past 24 hours .
multiple witnesses have him on the opposite side
of the island at t.o.d.
which alibis him out for remy &apos;s murder .
that changes things some .
not necessarily .
think about this .
remy was totally out of the game for a decade , right ?
but then , within just 48 hours of levi &apos;s release ,
he suddenly turns up dead .
so if he didn &apos;t pull the trigger ,
he definitely ordered the hit .
exactly . you said yourself that levi &apos;s m.o.
is to get other people to do his dirty work for him .
so help him put the money together . gain his trust .
and that way , even if he never cops to the murder ,
we nail him on a drug charge .
either way , he spends the rest of his life in jail .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve @-@ i &apos;ve been out of the game for a long time .
kamekona , no one knows better than you
the damage that he &apos;s capable of .
let &apos;s put him away before he can hurt anyone else .
in for a penny , in for a pound , right ?
well , um , i guess what happened was i read the , uh ,
course description incorrectly
and , like , misread it . and ...
long story short , danny and i ended up , uh ,
registered in here with you guys in couples therapy .
question : why are you still here ?
that &apos;s a good question . i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s a ... good question .
while it &apos;s true
this workshop is geared toward couples ,
many of the principles covered here--
such as communication ,
trust and teamwork--
apply to all relationships .
including working partnerships .
so given that steve and danny traveled all this way ,
i &apos;ve agreed to sign off on their therapy hours
once they &apos;ve completed the course .
i should also tell you that i &apos;ve spoken
with steve and danny about their partnership ,
and it is fraught
with some very serious problems .
so i think it would be both cruel
and irresponsible for us to
abandon them in this time of crisis .
really ? i don &apos;t .
because they &apos;re not a couple .
so what , keren ?
they &apos;re stuck in a relationship they can &apos;t get out of ,
they fight all the time , and they don &apos;t have sex .
it sounds a lot like our marriage to me .
okay , settle down .
we have a lot of work to do ,
and i don &apos;t want to waste any more time ,
so i &apos;ll ask everyone to hold hands
as we get things started with some daily affirmations .
i come from the loving space of my heart ,
and i know that love opens new possibilities .
i come from the loving space ...
this is great for us .
... of my heart ,
i hate you .
and i know that love ...
kamekona &apos;s still working on
getting the details on that drug buy .
once he gets us a time and a location ,
we can set up a sting and be in a position to make the bust .
okay , if you think that &apos;s best .
i take it you don &apos;t .
that &apos;s not it .
i worked with plenty cis in my day .
some were pretty good , pretty solid .
couple of &apos; em even helped me close a case .
see , the problem is those are the ones that are so good ,
you forget that the guy you &apos;re working with isn &apos;t a cop .
i hear you ,
but i &apos;m gonna tell you what john mcgarrett told me
the first time i brought in a ci .
he said , &quot; once they &apos;re yours ,
they &apos;re yours for life . &quot;
so i &apos;m telling you that kamekona &apos;s more than just a ci to me .
he &apos;s &apos; ohana .
and i &apos;ve also seen what levi is capable of .
so , believe me when i tell you
that no one wants to see him
put away more than kamekona .
thanks to our undercover op ,
we &apos;re now up on levi &apos;s burner phone .
call logs confirm that levi was nowhere near the crime scene
at the time of remy &apos;s murder , but check this out .
shortly after t.o.d. ,
levi receives a call
from a prepaid phone
less than a mile from where the body was discovered .
oh , that &apos;s the shooter .
that &apos;s the guy that levi hired for the hit .
he &apos;s calling to tell him remy &apos;s dead .
right , so if we can track this guy down
and get him to roll on levi ,
then we can pull kamekona out of there
before the buy even goes down .
imagine the outside legs
represent the two individuals in the relationship ,
while the middle leg represents your union as a couple .
so long as you work together , you are beautifully in sync !
all right , next lap , we &apos;re taking a dive .
what are you talking about ? why ?
it &apos;s an evasive maneuver .
okay , i need to get to my cell phone
so i can text alissa about tonight .
you &apos;re gonna be my distraction .
we &apos;re about to win this thing . you want to fall now ?
come on , let &apos;s just finish . hey , hey , hey .
priorities , okay ? priorities , danny .
just fake an injury , go down , stay down .
hang on . it &apos;s a bad idea .
here we go . here we go .
ankle . ankle .
hey , guys , we got a man down here , man down .
ankle .
okay . everything &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m gonna get some ice , okay ?
can you make sure he stays on his back ?
stays on his back till i get back ?
okay .
晚点告诉你细节
all right ...
all right .
oh , my god .
dude , that actually looks kind of funky .
it does ? you think ? thanks , steven .
okay , got some ice .
okay , everyone , take note .
because that is exactly the type of partner
you want by your side in a crisis .
note his caring , loving and gentle touch .
now , that &apos;s a sound i &apos;ll never take for granted again .
i hate to interrupt your moment of zen ,
but it &apos;s time you fill me in on the details of the buy .
keehi small boat harbor , tomorrow morning .
okay . now i know the where and when .
who &apos;s the buyer ?
guy i hooked up with while i was on the inside .
nobody you would know .
that &apos;s reassuring .
look , i would tell you that you can trust the dude ,
but really , i shouldn &apos;t have to ,
because you should trust me .
i do , levi .
good .
and know this .
i won &apos;t make the same mistake twice ,
dealing with rats like remy .
in the end ,
the only people you can count on
are your family .
kanoa , what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re tearing the place apart .
check it out , big bruddah .
kamekona tupuloa .
i &apos;m detective chin ho kelly .
what you doing here ?
colby jefferson .
i don &apos;t know him .
oh , really ? i think you do .
you see , we already know that he &apos;s dealing drugs
for you and your partner , levi sosa .
now no one &apos;s seen the kid in over two weeks .
look , i &apos;m sorry , but i don &apos;t know nothing about that .
and if you could prove i was dealing drugs ,
i &apos;d be locked up right now ,
instead of asking you to get the hell out of my mom &apos;s house .
you seem like a smart guy , kamekona ,
which means you probably already figured out
that levi sosa is a very dangerous man .
and guys in your line of work--
they only end up in two places .
prison or dead .
so i &apos;m asking you to look at this like an opportunity .
an opportunity to give levi up
before he drags you down with him .
levi is &apos; ohana .
i don &apos;t roll on family !
all right , we &apos;ll do this the hard way .
keep on searching !
tear the place apart if you have to .
okay , so , the suspect &apos;s phone came online
less than 20 minutes ago .
it pinged to that rental house over there .
according to the owner , the place was prepaid in cash .
it &apos;s got to be remy &apos;s shooter .
we need to move now .
man down ! i got a man down !
take cover !
go ! go ! go !
clear .
clear .
clear .
clear .
clear .
you &apos;re a former navy seal .
what happened to stealth mode ?
i &apos;m sorry .
you awake ?
you don &apos;t have to whisper now .
no , i &apos;m not awake . i &apos;m asleep , you putz .
did you see the photos i sent you ?
yeah , i @-@ i saw the photos you sent me . ‭
we had fun .
yeah , you look ... guys look like you &apos;re having a great time .
the girls were really bummed you didn &apos;t make it .
yeah . i didn &apos;t know what to tell &apos; em .
you could have told them
you destroyed my entire weekend .
i hope you know that . i hope you &apos;re happy .
you know what ? it &apos;s the second time this month
that ankle &apos;s given out on you .
it &apos;s not the ankle , the ankle , the ankle , danny .
we both know this trip never had a chance from the start .
oh , yeah , what was that supposed to mean ?
i &apos;m just curious . huh ?
what do i mean by that ?
i &apos;m talking about your attitude .
i &apos;m talking about this black hole
of negative energy that is detective danny williams , man .
i just brought us out here
to try to have some fun , reconnect a little bit ,
get away from work for a minute ,
and @-@ and you &apos;re just ... you &apos;re just ...
you &apos;ve been down on this thing from the start .
well , for good reason ,
apparently , it turns out , right ?
you ever hear of the power of positive thinking , danny ?
yeah , well , it works the other way , too .
it &apos;s the power of negative thinking .
bad things happen to negative people .
see example 1a-- you .
how is ... ? you basically crippled me
going after this girl .
and somehow it &apos;s my fault ?
loraine said we &apos;re not allowed to go to bed
unless we resolve our arguments , all right ?
so , fine .
i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
okay .
okay , good , &apos; cause my head has a date
with this medium ... medium @-@ firm goose down .
let me ask you a serious question .
you really think i &apos;m that negative ?
steve ?
steven ?
what are you doing ?
making sure we &apos;re not being tailed .
hey , guys .
they just stopped in the middle of the highway .
well , if we stop , we &apos;re gonna blow kamekona &apos;s cover .
we don &apos;t stop . kono , we don &apos;t stop .
just blow right past &apos; em .
you got it .
change of plans .
seller wants us to go to him .
you trust me , right ?
of course .
good .
where is he ? where &apos;s my brother ?
we haven &apos;t booked him yet , but that will happen ,
unless you can talk some sense into him .
how long has levi had you running for him ?
kanoa , listen to me .
you got pinched with two bricks of h.
that &apos;s 20 years mandatory .
and there &apos;s only one way out of it .
go ahead . say it .
you got to give up levi .
tell them he put you up to this .
no .
i &apos;m no snitch .
you want levi , you got him .
but my brother--
he don &apos;t get charged .
i just want to feel like i &apos;m a priority to him .
even when we &apos;re making love ,
i feel like he &apos;s not really present .
maybe that &apos;s because i have to schedule an appointment
with you to be there .
i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m so busy juggling a job
and raising your two children .
maybe if you valued that , i &apos;d give it up more often .
danny , you haven &apos;t exactly been participating .
what &apos;s your take on all this ?
uh , my take on , uh , this is ,
um-- sorry-- it &apos;s stupid ,
and i &apos;d like to just go take a nap if that &apos;s okay .
so you don &apos;t see the value in anything we do here ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t . personally , i don &apos;t , and i &apos;ll ...
i &apos;ll tell ... i &apos;ll tell you why .
my @-@ my folks-- they &apos;ve been married for 40 years .
and , uh , they fought a bunch ,
but they never went through anything like this , so ...
danny , this isn &apos;t about your parents .
this is about you and steve .
this is not about me . this is ...
let me ... let me ... let me just say something , okay ?
just me . my opinion .
i don &apos;t know when it became so important
to overanalyze everything
in our lives , to talk about everything
in our relationships , okay ? you guys love each other .
that &apos;s enough . to me . all right ? you know ?
you are there for her , she is there for you .
that @-@ that &apos;s commitment , right ?
but this , this , everybody &apos;s poking at everybody .
poke , poke , poke . it &apos;s like an open wound .
you know ? and eventually what you &apos;re gonna do is
you &apos;re gonna say something that you cannot take back . all right ?
you &apos;re just ... you &apos;re chipping away at all the good .
and at the end of the day ,
there &apos;s gonna be nothing left but the bad .
and then let me tell you what happens .
you are sitting alone in a one @-@ bedroom apartment
putting a futon together for your daughter
coming over every wednesday night .
you got pizza on speed dial . bad pizza .
okay ? and that &apos;s not a place that you want to be .
please . trust me .
well , guys , i , uh ...
i really feel like we made some progress here this morning .
that was really good .
really good stuff .
hey , come on , kono .
we need to close some distance here .
we &apos;re falling way too far behind .
hey , i &apos;m pushing this thing as fast as i can .
hold on . they &apos;re pulling in somewhere .
1360 kalaheo avenue .
it &apos;s a hotel .
i don &apos;t like this .
why the hell is levi calling an audible this late in the game ?
kanoa ?
hello , brother .
kanoa , what is this ?
this ?
this is just business .
see , while you were slinging shave ice ,
me and little bro here launched an enterprise of our own .
i hooked him up with a connect out in cali .
got him working the distribution lines
so there &apos;d be product to move
when i was released .
he returned the favor
by letting me know that it was you who snitched me out .
so if you knew it was me ,
why take out remy ?
because , way back when ,
that punk disrespected us .
i couldn &apos;t let it slide .
before you put me out to pasture ,
you figured you &apos;d squeeze me for whatever you could .
use me to put together some quick cash .
you always were the smartest man in the room .
but you &apos;re wrong about one thing .
i &apos;m not gonna kill you .
he is .
you still don &apos;t see him for who he is , do you ?
he had you running drugs when you were a kid .
had you do remy for him so he didn &apos;t have to .
and now ...
you &apos;re gonna kill your own blood for him ?
you &apos;ve been dead to me for a long time .
may as well make it official .
if that &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna end ,
go ahead .
i still love you , baby brother .
that &apos;s really touching .
five @-@ o ! get down on the ground now !
put your weapon down .
give me your hands , kanoa .
he &apos;s dead .
kamekona , you can &apos;t be late for school again .
i know . i know . but baby brother needs his breakfast .
i love you , kanoa .
p.a. agreed to the deal .
you keep your nose clean . you &apos;ll be out in two years .
look , kamekona ,
second chances for guys like you are pretty rare .
so the question is , what are you gonna do with yours ?
now , personally , i &apos;m inclined to believe that
if you just put your head to it ,
there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t do .
shave ice .
what about it ?
big margins .
water &apos;s free . flavoring &apos;s cheap .
you start a shave ice company . i &apos;ll be your first customer .
what &apos;s up , good @-@ lookin &apos; ?
can i get you something ?
hey , buddy . can i , uh ...
i &apos;ll just have what he &apos;s having .
and a big glass of water .
you got it . coming up .
thought you were gonna see alissa .
uh , yeah , i was . but i , uh ... you know , i blew it off
to , uh ... to come and hang with you instead .
you didn &apos;t have to do that . i &apos;m fine .
well , i didn &apos;t do it for you .
no , look , you see all these people ,
all these nice people sitting around ?
you know how much money they spent
to have this dream vacation experience ?
i personally don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair that their experience
be marred by the sight of
a gimpy @-@ ankled man sitting here
eating a $ 20 hamburger by himself . it &apos;s just not right .
so , you know , for their sake , enjoy my company .
see , i thought you were just concerned for me .
nope .
here is your water .
want to hear something crazy ?
i don &apos;t know how crazy it is , but ...
when rachel and i started having our problems ,
she ... suggested that we go see a marriage counselor together .
i , of course , said no . i figured ,
&quot; look , we got problems . we &apos;ll figure it out ourselves . &quot;
but , uh , we never did that , did we ?
well , you think therapy would &apos;ve saved your marriage ?
no .
probably not .
you know , we had a lot of problems .
some hers , some mine . but ...
the point is , is that she , um ...
she was willing to do whatever it took
to save our family , and i guess ...
i guess maybe i wasn &apos;t . and that ...
kind of sticks with me , you know ?
you left everything and moved to hawaii ,
so that gracie would have a father in her life .
and still you question your commitment to your family .
don &apos;t do it . no one can question your commitment to your family .
i don &apos;t know . i just ...
you know , it &apos;s hard not to think about the fact
that things maybe could &apos;ve been different
had i gone to see that counselor with her . i don &apos;t know .
things would &apos;ve been different .
maybe you would never have met me . how about that ?
one can dream .
i got to tell you , man . your ankle aside ,
look around you right now , i mean , there are ...
there are much worse places a failed marriage could land you .
you got to admit it . look at this place .
yeah . no .
i agree . my failed marriage brings me to hawaii , and ...
my dysfunctional relationship with you brings me here .
we even screwed this up .
yeah , we didn &apos;t get that right , either .
didn &apos;t get this right .
where &apos;s my burger ? i &apos;m starving , man .
here , have half of this . i feel my stomach eating itself .
i &apos;ll eat your other half .
have that one .
all right , thanks , pal .
it &apos;s good , huh ?
this is the best hamburger i ever had in my life .
worth the 25 bucks .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
this place really has everything .
i used that artisanal soap .
forget about it . unbelievable . unb ...
what &apos;d i tell you ?
my hands have never been so soft , not in my entire life .
can i feel ?
yeah , feel this .
huh ? crazy , right ? right ? feel .
oh , that is nice .
so ... really g @-@ give it a rub .
that is so soft .
feel up in here , too .
you washed your arms ? like that ?
everything .
that &apos;s like the ... like ... that &apos;s a doctor .
you &apos;re like a surgeon .
like , the fur is now like , um ...
it &apos;s like down .
it &apos;s like down fur .
it &apos;s like ... it &apos;s like the pillows !
take that one .
before you think of saying anything ,
know this , i have people outside your house right now .
and if they don &apos;t hear from me in exactly ten minutes ,
she &apos;s dead .
what do you want ?
