i think i &apos;ll go with the chicken piccata instead of the cornish game hen .
will there be a vegetarian option , you know , for me ?
yes . definitely .
what is it ?
dancing .
hey .
hey .
i saw the porsche parked out front .
can i get the keys ? thought i &apos;d take that bad boy for a spin .
ross drives it ? when i ask , you say you &apos;re the only one allowed to drive it .
he &apos;s my brother , plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it .
it &apos;s a car , monica , not a rocket ship .
just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you &apos;re done .
hey .
hi .
saw the porsche . looking good . when can i take it out again ?
you let joey drive it ?
i &apos;ve never driven it . not once .
okay , once . okay , i drive it all the time .
so much for the &quot; you @-@ can @-@ drive @-@ it but @-@ don &apos;t @-@ tell @-@ rachel &quot; plan .
wow , i can &apos;t believe you lied to me .
i can fix this . monica , rachel thinks all you talk about is the wedding .
there . i &apos;ve blown both your secrets . now we &apos;re even .
i won &apos;t let you drive the porsche because you &apos;re a terrible driver .
there . that wasn &apos;t about the wedding .
if you want a ride in the porsche , i &apos;ll take you around the block .
you got a couple hours ?
the one with chandler &apos;s dad
whew , that was a brisk ride .
take the top down , did you ?
only way to fly .
give me the keys . monica &apos;s wrong . i &apos;m an excellent driver .
you &apos;re fast and irresponsible.that adds up to a bad driver .
in high school , that added up to head cheerleader .
did you see the look that girl just gave me ?
she must &apos;ve seen me cruising in the bad boy .
she &apos;s checking out your beehive .
what ?
give me a brush .
the keys .
no way !
well , no brush .
fine . it doesn &apos;t matter .
if i remember correctly , there &apos;s a comb on the floor of the bathroom .
alimony .
we still haven &apos;t gotten an rsvp from your dad .
oh , right . maybe that &apos;s because i didn &apos;t send him an invitation .
why not ?
an invitation ? that &apos;s like almost asking him to come .
he &apos;s your father . he should be at our wedding .
i was gonna send him an invite but then i saw the stamp .
it was one of those marilyn monroe stamps and i thought :
my dad has that dress .
wow . - that must be a very different view when he stands over an air vent .
you should see him singing &quot; happy birthday , mr. president . &quot;
we have to invite him .
i don &apos;t even know the man . i haven &apos;t seen him in years .
and when he finds out he wasn &apos;t asked ?
we don &apos;t run in the same circles .
i hang out with you guys and he ...
... stars in a drag show in vegas .
i think i want to trade circles .
you don &apos;t want him there . nobody will stare at the bride ...
... when the father of the groom is wearing a backless dress .
so what ? as long as he &apos;s not wearing a white dress and veil , i don &apos;t care .
i think i need to do some shopping .
nice .
my god !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
just washing the windshield .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;ll let you drive this car .
couldrt find the comb ?
no .
why don &apos;t you just hand over the keys .
oh !
do not start this car .
okay , okay . i will give you 20 bucks ...
... if you get out of this car right now . hey !
look .
if you &apos;re so freaked out , just get in the car .
with you ? yeah , right .
all right .
okay , okay , okay .
what are you doing ? get in the front .
in the death seat ? !
hey , guys .
hi , sweetie .
ready to go ?
my purse is at monica &apos;s . i &apos;ll be back .
wait a minute .
what ? oh .
that one kept going .
so , you and phoebe , huh ?
how long have you been going out ?
over a month .
we ought to get to know each other better .
sure . i &apos;d like that .
yeah . so , uh ...
what &apos;s your name ?
it &apos;s jake .
joey .
do you like the knicks ?
yeah , big fan .
me too . there &apos;s a game on tuesday . do you want to go ?
great ! let me make sure i &apos;m not doing anything tuesday .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
your suitcase . we &apos;re going to vegas .
are you serious ? eloping ? no more stupid wedding stuff .
no more these flowers , these flowers.think of the money we &apos;ll save .
we &apos;re not eloping . i love the flowers . can our wedding be bigger , please ?
we &apos;re going to see your dad .
i want to get to know my father @-@ in @-@ law .
we already went over this and i won .
no , you didn &apos;t . honey , just so you know ...
now that you &apos;re marrying me , you don &apos;t get to win anymore .
forget it . i don &apos;t want to go . i don &apos;t want to see him .
i know your dad embarrassed you .
all kids are embarrassed by their parents .
you &apos;d have to come up with a new word for what i went through .
in high school , he came to all my swim meets ...
... dressed as a different hollywood starlet .
it &apos;s hard enough to be 14 .
you &apos;re skinny , you &apos;re wearing speedos that your mom promised you &apos;d grow into .
you look up in the stands . there &apos;s your dad cheering you on .
dressed as carmen miranda , wearing a headdress with real fruit ...
... that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack .
but he was there !
my dad didn &apos;t come to one of my brownie meetings .
you were a brownie ?
no . i ate them .
the point is , he was at every one of your swim meets , cheering you on .
that &apos;s a pretty great dad .
he had sex with mr. garibaldi .
who &apos;s mr. garibaldi ?
does it matter ? !
you &apos;re not 14 anymore , okay ? maybe it &apos;s time you let that stuff go .
if he &apos;s not at your wedding , you &apos;ll regret it for the rest of your life .
okay , but i &apos;m just doing this for you .
so i never get to win anymore ?
how much did you ever win before ?
you know how when you &apos;re wearing pants and you lean forward ...
... i check out your underwear ?
well , when jake did it ...
... i saw that he was wearing women &apos;s underwear .
i know . they were mine .
oh !
no , no , wait . that &apos;s weird .
we were goofing around , and i dared him to try them on .
that &apos;s weird !
i &apos;m wearing his briefs right now .
that &apos;s kind of hot .
i think so too . and that little flap ? it &apos;s great for holding my lipstick .
i wouldn &apos;t know about that .
jake says that womers underwear is actually more comfortable .
he loves how silk feels against his skin .
next he &apos;ll say your high heels are good for his posture .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with jake . he is all man .
i think more than you .
he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacies .
i &apos;m just saying only a man completely secure in his masculinity ...
... could wear womers underwear . i don &apos;t think you could .
i am secure with my masculinity .
okay , whatever .
you &apos;ve seen my huge stack of porn , right ?
here you go .
look all you want . there &apos;s nothing there .
slow down , or i am returning to the back seat .
would you calm down ?
no ! you &apos;re driving 15 miles over the speed limit .
i &apos;m driving 5 miles over the limit . they raised it by 10 .
what , are they crazy ? !
god , i forgot how much i love driving .
i have got to get my license renewed .
you don &apos;t have a valid driver &apos;s license ? pull over right now .
ross , you &apos;re so tense . you just gotta relax , okay ?
just need to relax . all right ? just need to relax .
what are you ... ? that &apos;s not funny . stop horsing around .
i am not horsing around , okay ?
i am &quot; porsche @-@ ing &quot; around .
uh @-@ oh .
stay calm . nothing will happen . you &apos;re not in that much trouble .
really ? you think so ?
i was talking to myself . you &apos;re going down !
has someone taken your order ?
oh , yeah . she did . he did . she ?
i &apos;m sorry , i &apos;m new . i don &apos;t ...
i just ordered a beer .
you &apos;re straight . i get it .
if we called your dad , we &apos;d have better seats .
i don &apos;t want him to know we &apos;re here yet . i &apos;m not ready for that .
besides , he won &apos;t be too happy to see me either .
why not ?
i don &apos;t know if i told you ...
... but he &apos;s kind of tried to contact me a lot the last few years .
what ?
yeah . he &apos;s made phone calls , written letters .
he came to new york . but i always said i was too busy .
it &apos;s very &quot; cats in the cradle . &quot; i don &apos;t want to get into it .
here we go .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome the incomparable ...
... helena handbasket .
hello , darlings .
and there &apos;s daddy .
switch places with me . come on ! i &apos;ll go under , you go over .
yeah , i &apos;ll get right on that .
come on !
what ? no . hey , rach , come on .
come on !
i &apos;m sure we won &apos;t get arrested for this .
god !
hi , officer . was i going a little too fast ?
oh , my god .
can i see your license , please ?
absolutely .
it &apos;s weird . i had a dream last night that i was stopped by a policeman .
and then he ...
well , i probably shouldn &apos;t tell you the rest .
he gave you a big ...
... fat ...
... ticket ?
your license .
yes . here you go , officer ...
... handsome .
it &apos;s hanson .
oops , sorry . my mistake .
dear lord !
wow !
here it comes .
this is a great picture .
really ? you think so ? you know , i had just rolled right out of bed .
you look phenomenal .
she should ! it was taken 10 years ago !
you know , you &apos;re probably wondering about the old date .
yes , i am . you &apos;re an aquarius , huh ?
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re a gemini .
no .
taurus ?
no .
virgo ?
no .
sagittarius ?
yep .
i knew it . i knew it !
you won &apos;t speed anymore , right ?
i won &apos;t speed .
and you promise to take care of this ?
i promise .
in the meantime , let him drive . does he have a license ?
can he handle a stick ?
well ...
i can handle a stick !
that can &apos;t be your father .
i &apos;ve been saying that for years .
oh , my god !
what ?
that &apos;s mr. garibaldi playing the piano .
hello , and welcome to the show .
i see some of our regulars in the audience .
and a couple of irregulars .
he &apos;s coming into the audience .
relax . you &apos;ll be fine .
oh , much better . you &apos;re invisible now .
where are you from ?
bakersfield .
i &apos;m sorry ?
bakersfield .
no , no , i heard . i &apos;m just sorry .
it can &apos;t happen like this . i &apos;ll meet you back at the hotel .
look , a standing ovation already . so early in the show .
turn around , darling . let me see your pretty face .
can we have our drinks , please ? waiter ? ... tress ?
hey , pheebs .
hey .
check it out .
how much of a man am i ?
wow , nice . manly , and also kind of a slut .
i &apos;m beginning to see what jake was talking about .
the silk feels really good .
and things aren &apos;t as smashed down as i thought they would be .
that &apos;s great .
you have so many more choices than with mens underwear .
bikini , french cut , thong . and the fabrics : cotton , silk , lace .
you know what i &apos;ve always wondered about ? pantyhose !
the way they start at your toe , then they go all the way up to ...
i should go take these off , shouldn &apos;t i ?
i think it &apos;s important you do .
what &apos;s your name ?
chandler .
chandler ?
what an unusual name .
you must have had terribly fascinating parents .
oh , they &apos;re a hoot .
and who is your friend ?
i &apos;m monica .
monica . where are you from ?
new york .
i &apos;m not very fond of new york .
queens , i like .
what is this ...
... sparkling something , honey , huh ?
actually , monica and i are engaged .
really ?
congratulations .
when &apos;s the big day ?
in two weeks .
i see .
well , i wish you both a lifetime of happiness .
so , you &apos;re bald .
wait , wait .
we &apos;d love it if you could be there .
really ?
i know it would make me happy ...
... ma &apos;am .
then i wouldn &apos;t miss it for the world .
i &apos;m getting all misty here .
you &apos;d think i was having my legs waxed or something .
you okay ?
yeah .
thanks for making me do this .
before we go on with the show , i want to say to the bride and groom ...
... how lucky they are to have found each other .
in every life a little rain must fall .
fortunately ...
... in my life ...
when i was growing up , i played the one on the far left .
i think you &apos;ve had enough fun for today .
remind me to introduce you to someone .
who ?
fourth gear .
what does he want ? i wasn &apos;t doing anything .
maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2 : 00 position .
maybe it &apos;s sergeant sagittarius coming back to flirt some more .
perhaps he didn &apos;t tarnish the badge enough .
it &apos;s a different guy .
good evening , officer .
do you know how fast you were going ?
no , i don &apos;t , but it couldn &apos;t have been more than 60 .
you &apos;re right . it was 37 .
really ?
can i see your license , please ?
you &apos;re kidding .
you &apos;re not gonna give me a ticket for driving too slow , are you ?
that &apos;s right .
you wanna help me out here ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
can you do your little thing that you did before ?
i don &apos;t think so .
i don &apos;t think i want to tarnish his badge .
you know , officer ...
i had the weirdest dream last night .
oh , my god !
your license , please .
you don &apos;t want to hear about my dream ...
... officer ...
... pretty ?
it &apos;s petty .
i &apos;ll be right back with your ticket .
you have a son .
i know . i know .
you feel better ?
yeah . much .
listen ...
not that i &apos;m insecure about my manood or anything ...
... but i think i need to hook up with a woman right now .
i understand .
you look familiar . do i know you ?
i don &apos;t think so .
maybe it &apos;s because i &apos;m on television .
i &apos;m an actor on days of our lives .
wow . really ?
$ 4.50 , please .
oh , let me get this .
