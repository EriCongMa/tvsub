yes or no , in or out , up or down .
and then there are the choices that matter ...
to love or hate ...
to be a hero or to be a coward ...
to fight or to give in ...
to live ...
or die .

a gun section .
anyway , when--when ...
when i bought the gun , i ...
i got all this ammunition--
ammo .
i bought a whole bunch of it &apos; cause ...
it was-- it was on sale .
and then this morning ...
i was packing it into my coat .
i didn &apos;t have enough room for all of it in my pockets ...
because ...
i wanted to bring my flask .
you mind ?
i &apos;m not much of a drinker .
but i figured i &apos;d need some liquid courage .
you want some ?
no , thanks .
the funny part is ...
i didn &apos;t need a drink until now--
right now .
and the only reason i need a drink
is because ...
i only have one bullet left .
i left bullets at home
because i thought i &apos;d need a drink .
and the only reason i need a drink is because ...
i don &apos;t have enough bullets .
see , i was gonna kill you ...
shoot you right in the face ...
watch you suffer and die .
and then i was gonna shoot myself .
but i only have one bullet left .
then it seems , you have a bit of a problem .
i do .
i do .
i have one hell of a problem .
you sure you don &apos;t want a drink ?
vodka .
that &apos;s nice .
hey .
what &apos;s it gonna be , mr. clark ?
me or you ?
you shoot me , s.w.a.t. &apos; s gonna get you .
and they &apos;re not gonna shoot you .
they &apos;re gonna capture you
and they &apos;re gonna take you to prison .
or you shoot yourself ...
then you &apos;re free ...
done ...
maybe get to see your wife again .
so you have a choice to make .
me or you ?
a life in prison ...
or an afterlife with your wife ?
s @-@ screw you .
see , i &apos;ve lived .
i mean , i &apos;ve really , really lived .
i &apos;ve failed ...
i &apos;ve been devastated , i &apos;ve been broken ...
i &apos;ve gone to hell and back .
and i &apos;ve also known joy ... and passion .
and i &apos;ve had a great love .
see ...
death for me ...
is not justice .
it &apos;s an ... end of a beautiful journey .
and i &apos;m not afraid to die .
the question is ...
are you ?
a life in prison ...
or an afterlife ... with your wife ?
me or you ?
your choice .

live or die ...
that &apos;s the important choice .
