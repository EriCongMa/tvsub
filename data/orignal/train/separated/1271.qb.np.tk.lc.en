go , son !
let &apos;s go , buddy !
that was a cross @-@ check , ref !
are you blind ? !
excuse me .
i &apos;m watching a game here .
oh , my god ! use the whistle ! that &apos;s what it &apos;s for !
hey . can i just squeeze by ?
that is bullshit !
he checked my kid ! you can &apos;t give him the penalty !
please , excuse me .
that was my foot , lady .
sorry . i was just trying to get by .
please don &apos;t push me .
now you made me miss the play .
hey . i &apos;m talking to you .
next time , don &apos;t push , bitch .
hey ! that &apos;s offsides !
oh . not those .
what &quot; not those &quot; ? you have six other identical pair .
they &apos;re not identical .
that &apos;s black patent , black suede , kitten heel .
wish i had just one matching pair .
clear the clutter , cleanse the soul .
i might need those .
okay , so , you are not the person who hired my mother
to help you clean out your closet ?
no .
great . let &apos;s go do something else .
no , i @-@ i mean ... yes .
okay . maybe the shoes are a little too overwhelming for you .
when was the last time you wore this dress ?
i haven &apos;t had a chance .
i was with you when you bought it .
three years ago .
donation pile .
no , no ! i paid to have it tailored .
why ? so we could lord it over all the other frumpy frocks ?
so help me , if that is amazon delivering more shoes ...
okay .
if you &apos;re doing this to help mom make extra money , please stop .
okay . you &apos;re not responsible for her finances .
yes , but we both know something &apos;s wrong .
then why won &apos;t she just tell me ?
i don &apos;t know .
cailin , hi .
uh , come on in .
is everything okay ?
my mom went to europe .
you didn &apos;t go with her ?
well , here . let me help . - no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s fine . i got it .
what happened to your foot ?
well , i sprained my ankle .
oh . sorry .
i &apos;m sorry you &apos;re not in europe .
i have finals .
listen . i know this is a lot to ask .
can i stay with you ?
with me ?
uh , yes , sure .
sure . you don &apos;t want to be home alone ?
i wasn &apos;t alone .
my mother hired mrs. craberton to babysit me .
you &apos;re 19 .
i know . right ?
i knew you guys would understand .
uh , so , how long is hope gone ?
three weeks . thank you .
oh . hey , dude .
yeah , i did the homework .
um , cailin . w @-@ where are you going ?
oh , is it okay if i just stay in your spare bedroom ?
yes , yes . i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll show you where it is .
that &apos;s okay . i can find it .
no , i &apos;m listening . oh , my god . he so did not .
oh , my god . he so did , too .
three weeks ? !
well , you &apos;ll get to know each other better .
she &apos;s your half @-@ sister .
okay , we got a possible homicide in the parking lot
of the hockey rink out by suffolk downs .
that is like 100 decibels !
you know , i just read a report about hearing loss in adolescents .
it &apos;s up 30 % . i &apos;ll meet you there .
hey . thanks for bringing me in on this .
i figured you should help out since we &apos;re hockey guys .
jane &apos;s not working it ?
she and dr. isles are almost here .
well , before she elbows me out of the way ,
can i get a minute of training ?
you bet . tell us what you see .
well , the human body holds 6 quarts of blood .
there &apos;s about 5 of it on the ground .
good . what else ?
i don &apos;t see too many crime @-@ scene markers .
did you find a purse or a wallet ?
no . nothing on the body or nearby .
she &apos;s not wearing much jewelry except a cheap charm bracelet .
maybe robbery was the motive .
could be , but it &apos;s a pretty vicious way to kill somebody
if all you want is their purse and jewelry .
hey . it &apos;s a youth hockey game .
you played , too , frost .
i once saw two parents go at each other
with their kids &apos; hockey sticks at a pee @-@ wee game .
sergeant korsak , we &apos;ve got 10 officers inside
on all the doors and exits .
good . nobody leaves .
everybody in that rink is a suspect .
hey , wendy .
hello , detective rizzoli .
this is detective frost .
sir .
you want to take a look at this ?
really ?
it &apos;s my dream to join homicide one day .
is it okay if i take a look , sir ?
be our guest .
okay . it &apos;s madness , right ?
that &apos;s one end of her carotid artery .
ohh . i &apos;ve only seen pictures of this stuff .
wow . incredible .
frankie , write down all the tags .
i want a record of every vehicle down here .
you got it .
i &apos;m heading inside .
officer rogers , i want another officer on that exit over there .
yes , sir . thanks a lot , uh , detectives , sir .
let me know if you need anything -- coffee , anything .
thanks .
man !
i got to get over this .
pretend it &apos;s that bag of giblets you pull out of a turkey
before you cook it .
inside your turkey ? every turkey ?
come on , dude . you can do this .
okay . now ...
just a little bit at a time , okay ?
you good ?
i wouldn &apos;t say &quot; good , &quot; but keep going .
it works . i &apos;m not gagging .
what did he use -- a dull can opener ?
is that her tongue hanging out ?
oh , god .
damn .
that did it . dinner &apos;s still inside .
all right .
i &apos;m not brave enough to stop a tied youth hockey game .
looks like we don &apos;t have a choice .
hey , ref !
boston police ! stop the game ! oh ! ref !
blow the whistle ! stop the game !
back away , mom !
what ?
hey ! i &apos;m a cop ! stop the game !
i don &apos;t care if you &apos;re the queen of england ! move , mom !
oh , you know what ?
you call me &quot; mom &quot; one more time
and you watch where i put that whistle .
it &apos;s a police emergency . stop the game . now .
all right , all right , look .
we &apos;re very sorry to interrupt your game .
okay , we are here to investigate a crime .
what kind of crime ?
sir , step back , please .
no , we had this in the bag .
i want to know how long it &apos;s gonna take .
longer if you don &apos;t step back .
this is crap . if my son &apos;s not playing , we &apos;re out of here .
nobody is leaving the arena .
unless it &apos;s in the back of a squad car .
can we have all parents standing with their children , please ?
pair up .
pair up . everybody get with your parents .
hmm . there &apos;s no parent with that boy .
hey , drew . where &apos;s your mom ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
anybody know where his mom is ?
uh , sometimes she goes outside to smoke
when the kid &apos;s line is off the ice .
son , what &apos;s your name ?
drew -- drew bigsby .
okay , drew . we &apos;re gonna step outside .
we &apos;re gonna look for your mom , okay ?
and what &apos;s her name ?
mary bigsby .
could -- could you stay with him for a few minutes ?
yeah , sure . no problem . wh @-@ what &apos;s going on ?
everything &apos;s okay . if we could all just stay inside , please ?
okay ? keep him inside , please . thank you .
nobody leave the arena .
i &apos;m seeing blood droplets far apart .
she was in a hurry .
so she was bleeding when she left the rink ,
which doesn &apos;t make sense .
why not ?
come on . take a look at the body .
tell me what you think .
hey , frost .
can you run a dmv search on mary bigsby ?
is that mary ?
think so .
here we go .
mary bigsby drives a blue minivan .
i got the tags right here . we &apos;ll find it .
your mother is staying with cailin .
do you think that &apos;s okay ?
do i think it &apos;s okay
that my mother is babysitting a grown adult ?
no , i do not .
hope was so insistent .
hope should back off .
just talk to me about the body .
she has a broken nose and a jagged injury to her throat .
see what doesn &apos;t make any sense ?
what doesn &apos;t make sense ?
two injuries -- broken nose and a slashed throat .
they &apos;re separate .
well , how do you know that ?
well , the blood spatter says
that she was ambushed from behind ,
but the droplets from her busted nose
says that she was punched over there .
you think we &apos;re looking for two attackers ?
maybe .
i think there may be a speed @-@ burn mark under the blood .
you &apos;re right .
no bloody tire tracks , though .
so what does that mean ?
somebody was going in reverse , braked hard here ,
and then sped off before she bled out .
you think the killer took the victim &apos;s car ?
we find her keys ?
negative . you think we &apos;re looking at a carjacking ?
you got a choice of cars , you steal a minivan ?
frankie &apos;s got eyes on mary bigsby &apos;s minivan .
someone inside .
all right , you take the right .
boston police . put your hands on the wheel now .
do not move your hands . keep them on that wheel .
all right , when i tell you ,
you clasp your hands behind your head .
do it now .
all right . now slowly get out of the car .
keep your hands where they are .
we &apos;ve got blood .
oh , come on .
see if she has any i.d.
all this over a hockey @-@ mom shoving match ?
you are mary bigsby ?
that &apos;s right .
take her in for questioning .
let &apos;s go . come on .
if that &apos;s mary bigsby ... who &apos;s that ?
hey , fellas . need you to take a look at the victim .
you recognize her ?
ew . it &apos;s horrible . yeah .
she looks like that lady
who showed up during practice , doesn &apos;t she ?
yeah , i think so .
you know her name ?
no . she was very nice .
she was a saleslady .
saleslady .
yeah , she gave one of these to all the players .
no @-@ drip helmet pads .
the kids wore them while they warmed up .
the kids were really excited
because she said the pads could tell if they were dehydrated .
how do they do that ?
no idea .
she gave the kids baggies ,
had them write their names on them ,
and she collected them before the game .
she took back used helmet pads ?
yeah , she &apos;s gonna analyze them
and bring the results to the next game .
did you see what kind of car she drove ?
no .
no , sorry .
thank you both .
i &apos;m gonna look up that company .
are we really thinking someone in here did this ?
i mean , wouldn &apos;t they be covered in blood ?
not necessarily .
arterial blood spray projected forward .
no such thing as no @-@ drip helmet pads .
how can that be ?
our dead jane doe worked for a company that doesn &apos;t exist ?
okay , thanks .
crime lab has the results on the blood on mary &apos;s shirt .
it matches our victim &apos;s .
who wants to face off against a killer hockey mom ?
been there , done that .
i had to live through my mother &apos;s hockey @-@ mom years .
your mother is too nice to be one of those mothers .
oh , yeah ? ask her about the time
that she stormed out onto the ice
in the middle of frankie &apos;s game
and hit the ref with her purse .
what did frankie do ?
tried to change his last name .
we &apos;ll take this one , then .
okay . good . i &apos;m going down to autopsy .
puncture wound is 0.5 centimeters at the apex .
12.7 centimeters of jagged tear .
ugh . it &apos;s like someone pulled her throat open with claws .
what kind of murder weapon does that ?
it snagged the carotid . notice i said &quot; snagged . &quot;
i noticed .
notice how much i would love to know what the murder weapon is .
carotid artery was pulled until it tore .
i notice you said &quot; pulled . &quot;
i did . by a weapon with a curved end .
okay . we &apos;ll put out an all @-@ points bulletin for captain hook .
there &apos;s a beige , gummy substance in the wound .
the lost boys &apos; gummy bears ?
it &apos;s hope . again .
all right .
hello ?
yes . you know , i am just in the middle of an autopsy .
no .
i do not know if cailin did her homework ,
but she &apos;s a sophomore in college .
okay , i will . i will make sure she goes to bed .
okay , bye @-@ bye .
wow . no wonder cailin is frustrated .
i am so glad that constance taught me to be independent .
what do i do ?
that &apos;s what they invented voicemail for , maura .
i can &apos;t .
hello ?
yes . yes .
no , i did say that i would monitor her
and make sure she takes her immunosuppression drugs .
no , no , no . you have every right to worry .
okay . i &apos;m sorry .
all right , bye @-@ bye .
okay , you just encouraged her to worry .
i just keep forgetting that cailin had a kidney transplant .
how do you forget ? it &apos;s your kidney .
no hits .
who are you ?
you have a lot of scripts , mary .
disturbing the peace , assault and battery ,
assault with a deadly weapon ?
deadly weapon ? it was a hockey stick .
which you used to break a referee &apos;s arm .
he made bad calls , so i said something , and he got personal .
is that what sets you off ? when someone gets personal ?
he called me a pig with lipstick .
man &apos;s lucky i don &apos;t have a temper .
what did she call you ?
is she dead ? what happened to her ?
you tell us . we found her blood on your clothes .
i punched her in the nose . that &apos;s it . i didn &apos;t kill her .
did you get into it with her at the game over your kids ?
she didn &apos;t even have a kid .
how do you know ?
it &apos;s a small league .
i know all the parents . never seen her before .
you just like punching strangers ?
i was trying to watch the game , and that lady kept pushing me ,
and then she rolls her case over my foot .
what case ?
i don &apos;t know . some sales case .
it hurt , so i pushed her back .
must have pushed her pretty hard .
i am telling you , i didn &apos;t kill her .
just one punch , and i watched her walk away .
look at my file --
just fat lips , bloody noses , and a ref &apos;s arm .
add a slashed throat .
oh , god . i think i &apos;m gonna be sick .
we &apos;re holding hockey mom , but i don &apos;t think she &apos;s our killer .
that lady &apos;s as squeamish as frost .
lady ? she puked on the table .
did she i.d. the victim , at least ?
no .
damn . well , maura &apos;s checking her dental records .
what else can we do ?
every car in that parking lot is accounted for .
okay .
there is no bus service in that area ,
there is no record of a taxi dropping anyone off ,
and there is no way that she walked more
than half a block in those heels ,
which means she had a car .
and we showed all the parents , employees ,
and coaches her photo .
kids remembered her handing out helmet pads .
no one knew her name .
killer took everything that could identify her .
except her body .
maybe because he was interrupted .
he pulls the car back , he stops here .
maybe he was about to dump her body in the trunk
and that &apos;s when mary came out to smoke .
that makes sense .
but if we can &apos;t i.d. her , we &apos;re screwed ,
unless she had a car and we can find it .
jane , i &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
what &apos;s the matter ?
cailin &apos;s missing .
angela , is cailin here ?
no , honey .
she &apos;s not here , jane .
no , i &apos;m not asking you to leave work .
okay .
i can &apos;t find cailin .
um , well , when &apos;s the last time you talked to her ?
four hours ago .
yes . yes , i checked all the hospitals .
and you checked back with the state troopers , right ?
maura , it &apos;s only 11 : 30 . she is a teenager .
i think we should file a missing person &apos;s .
yes , please , jane .
okay . thank you .
are you really gonna put out a missing person &apos;s bulletin ?
she could be at school .
well , i told her she had to stay in touch with me .
did you give her a curfew ?
no . i didn &apos;t know i needed to .
where the hell have you been ?
at the library .
well , you cannot do that .
i can &apos;t go to the library ?
no , you -- you cannot not return my texts .
oh . sorry . i @-@ i turned my phone off .
i was studying .
we -- we filed a missing person &apos;s report on you .
oh , my god . why would you do that ?
because i didn &apos;t know where you were !
i thought ...
i thought you were different .
you thought if you stayed with me
that you could just do whatever you wanted .
maura doesn &apos;t have kids .
i &apos;m not a kid .
no , you &apos;re not , but she is responsible for you .
well , i don &apos;t see how sending the police on a wild goose chase
is responsible .
you know , i have to call jane
and tell her not to put a bolo out for you .
yeah , she might have better things to do ,
like solve a murder .
well , i know i have better things to do
than take care of an irresponsible , selfish teenager .
maura .
look , she was just worried . that &apos;s all .
come on . have a brownie .
only if they have weed in them .
you brought marijuana here ?
yeah , &apos; cause that &apos;s what an irresponsible ,
selfish teenager would do .
it &apos;s a joke !
listen , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re stressed @-@ out
studying for your finals .
why don &apos;t you go take a bath ? i &apos;ll bring you a cup of tea .
okay .
i never get that angry .
that &apos;s what a fight with a sibling feels like .
it &apos;ll be okay , maura .
oh , my god .
shut up . why would you let him do that ?
good morning .
you &apos;re up early .
yeah , we -- we never went to bed .
right . why go to bed ?
you don &apos;t need any sleep for
rigorous premed coursework .
i &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t need it , either ,
because you &apos;re a genius like cailin .
she aces everything with or without sleep .
does she ?
you can take a shower , if you want .
oh . am i embarrassing you ?
i think you look great .
yeah , me too .
it &apos;s so cool when women your age
look good even without makeup .
my age ?
it &apos;s a compliment , maura .
really ?
i almost tripped over this young man .
i thought the homeless moved in to beacon hill .
dylan &apos;s from santa cruz . he misses sleeping outside .
yeah , i @-@ i love sleeping under the stars .
your brick walkway &apos;s not very comfortable , though .
cailin , can i speak to you upstairs ?
man , that looks good .
cool . good thing it &apos;s for you , then .
you are quite the hostess .
you made breakfast for ... dylan , is it ?
yeah , hey . how &apos;s it going ?
cailin , that looks delicious .
yours is in the oven , mrs. rizzoli .
so , do you want to talk now
or eat before your food gets cold ?
i wanted to scream when i saw my kitchen .
yeah , well , children push buttons you didn &apos;t even know you had .
well , she &apos;s not my child .
she &apos;s an adult ... child .
you know , i read somewhere
the brain isn &apos;t fully developed until 26,
which explains a lot .
well , maybe hope is right in treating her like a kid .
all she did was have a couple of friends over and make a mess .
which we cleaned up .
but she wasn &apos;t trying to get under your skin .
she needs to learn . set some boundaries .
you know , i barely know her . i don &apos;t want her to hate me .
look , teenagers are like big toddlers .
you would see the cute toddler
in her if she was yours .
maura , she &apos;s a good kid .
and she worships you .
no , she doesn &apos;t .
yes , she does .
set some boundaries , then stick to them .
oh , crap . i am so late .
bye . have a good day .
um , cailin ?
i would appreciate it if you cleaned up after yourself .
sure . yeah . i &apos;ll do it later . bye .
bye .
how was that ?
good .
i just don &apos;t understand she could be so oblivious .
come on . i was a slob when i was 19 .
and i bet you didn &apos;t start color @-@ coordinating your hangers
until you were in your 20s .
i was always neat .
okay . cailin is a good person . she &apos;s a good student .
does she have to be a good cleaner , too ?
no .
yes .
morning . anything ?
no . still a jane doe .
frost and i went through all the tow records
and parking tickets near the hockey rink .
nothing stands out .
we &apos;re still no closer to finding that phantom car .
results on the gummy substance in the wound came back .
the weapon had traces of paraffin , polyester fibers ,
and clotrimazole on it .
what &apos;s clotrimazole ?
anti @-@ fungal cream .
so our killer has jock itch or athlete &apos;s foot .
wait . paraffin ? wax .
killer was a hockey player .
a skater &apos;s shoelaces are made of polyester
and then rubbed down with wax so that they don &apos;t fray .
uh , the weapon is not a shoelace .
no , but ...
... could be something used to tighten the laces .
like what ?
skate hook .
maura , you said it had a hooked end .
could a skate hook be the murder weapon ?
well , the puncture wound was 0.05 centimeters .
that is consistent with it . it does have a blunt edge .
i &apos;d have to test one and compare it
to the wound track of the victim .
i &apos;m gonna get a coffee . anybody want anything ?
yeah . i &apos;d like a big jelly doughnut .
i get really hungry
when we talk about ripping apart someone &apos;s throat .
attaboy , frost .
hey , there .
hello , vince .
what are you doing taking out the trash ?
you want me to knock stanley around ?
no , i &apos;m -- i &apos;m just recycling .
everything all right ?
yeah .
you &apos;re not recycling .
what are you doing , angela ?
sit down .
i should have signed those divorce papers .
i will now .
for all the good it &apos;ll do me .
oh , boy . what happened ?
i don &apos;t want my kids to know any more bad stuff
about their father .
i &apos;m a vault .
he didn &apos;t pay our taxes .
uh @-@ oh . how much do you owe ?
$ 27,000 .
that &apos;s a lot of cans .
yeah , but i have several jobs i &apos;m doing ,
and -- and i &apos;ll find a way .
i @-@ i always do .
you work hard enough .
let me loan it to you , interest @-@ free .
it &apos;s not a problem .
i can &apos;t take your money , vince .
but thank you .
i &apos;ve tested every manufacturer &apos;s skate hook .
this is the last one .
what do you think ?
well , it &apos;s consistent with the victim &apos;s wound
in both depth and edge pattern .
so , our victim and our murder weapon
came out of that hockey rink .
maybe our killer did , too .
so , how many people were at the rink
when the first responders showed up ?
58 parents , 30 kids ,
2 coaches , and 5 rink employees .
we ran them all .
only crazy hockey mom mary had a record .
and who here thinks she &apos;s the killer ?
a skate hook is a weapon of opportunity .
if you &apos;re killing somebody with that ,
in a public place , you &apos;re not planning this .
yeah , and why was our victim
pretending to be a helmet @-@ pad saleswoman ?
and what &apos;s with all the sweat analyzing ?
she &apos;s looking for something . or maybe someone .
yeah , you can get dna from sweat .
only kids were wearing them ,
so maybe she was looking for a kid .
maybe . okay , let &apos;s go back to my missing @-@ car theory .
he killer didn &apos;t want the victim to be identified ,
so if she had a car , he got rid of it .
harbor is right near the rink .
best place to deep @-@ six a car is the bottom of the sea .
and we can &apos;t call the dive team
and have them search the entire harbor .
no , but we could ask them
to search the end of pier 21 .
somebody &apos;s in a guessing mood today .
it &apos;s more than a guess .
road construction
has all the streets in that area shut down
except the one to pier 21 .
and that area is abandoned , too .
nobody would see you push a car off a pier .
and while we &apos;re bothering the dive team ,
we might as well bring everybody in
who had access to a skate hook ,
including parents and ice @-@ rink employees .
and we can rule out kids and coaches
&apos;cause they were on or near the ice .
that &apos;s still 65 people .
who &apos;s gonna do all those interviews ?
hey , frankie .
what are you doing today ?
how would you feel about doing some interviews
for the hockey @-@ rink homicide we &apos;re working ?
love to .
yeah , i need divers in the water off pier 21 .
looking for a car .
you want a description ?
how about you let me know if you find more than one ?
thank you .
frankie , make 65 copies of that .
okay . why ?
yeah , why ?
&apos;cause we haven &apos;t had a break in this case ,
and it &apos;s time we got creative .
take a look at this photo , would you ?
do you recognize her ?
i don &apos;t . sorry .
take another look .
i just said i &apos;ve never seen her . you don &apos;t listen .
can i go ?
korsak .
where ?
i &apos;m on the way .
jane felt sorry for frankie .
she &apos;s helping him finish the interviews .
divers found a late @-@ model
ford focus off pier 21 .
they &apos;re pulling it out of the drink now .
should i tell jane ?
only if you want to switch places with her .
i &apos;d rather watch the big crane pull the car out of the ocean .
is that so wrong ?
no . come on .
this is so cool .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if there were a couple of lobsters in there ?
cannot believe i told frankie i would help him .
i don &apos;t ever want to talk to another hockey parent
as long as i live .
oh ! angela &apos;s pick @-@ me @-@ ups .
well , ma , i do hope you &apos;re not selling speed
to the secretarial pool .
no , you know , it &apos;s that 3 : 00 slump .
and stanley doesn &apos;t mind ?
i &apos;m filling a need . i &apos;m not taking his business .
okay , ma , enough . what &apos;s going on ?
it isn &apos;t anything i want to talk about .
you &apos;d tell me if you were in trouble , right ?
yeah .
jane , i just enjoy baking , okay ?
okay .
maybe she just doesn &apos;t want to burden you .
there are certain things my mother will not talk about .
money problems is at the top of that list .
speaking of problems ,
have you talked to cailin in the last five seconds ?
well , i told her she has to check in with me every 30 minutes .
ok . no .
you &apos;re the one with the problem .
me ? well , i &apos;m just trying to create boundaries .
give her what she wants -- a relationship .
okay , she came to you as a big sister ,
not as another mother .
hey , frost . what &apos;s up ?
jane , i think we found the victim &apos;s car .
that &apos;s great .
there &apos;s a purse ...
and a wallet and a cellphone .
yeah , it &apos;s the victim &apos;s .
found her no @-@ drip helmet @-@ pad sales case .
okay . what &apos;s her name ?
carla dalton , 42 years old .
she has a rhode island driver &apos;s license .
and a cohasset address .
hey . we have a parking permit .
looks like she worked at easton labs .
easton labs ? maybe they make helmet pads .
mm . no , no . easton labs is a pharmaceutical company .
they make drugs for neurological diseases .
carla dalton was an m.d.
she was easton labs &apos; director of clinical research .
tell frankie to go with korsak to her residence .
you meet me at easton labs .
will do .
our victim has a name -- dr. carla dalton .
oh , god .
yes , that &apos;s dr. dalton . she was a wonderful woman .
was she based here in boston ?
no . um , she was only in this office for a few months .
our headquarters are in new york .
but i supervised her research , so we talked frequently .
do you know if she was married ?
no , she wasn &apos;t .
no children , either ,
which is probably why she was such a dedicated researcher .
what kind of research was she doing ?
her passion was huntington &apos;s disease .
huntington &apos;s is an incurable hereditary brain disorder
that damages nerve cells and incapacitates you .
it &apos;s fatal .
did dr. dalton have huntington &apos;s ?
i never asked . she once told me that her sister had it .
we should have maura do a blood test , find out .
do you know what dr. dalton was working on
at the time of her death ?
she was conducting drug trials .
she was determined to find a cure for huntington &apos;s .
do you have any idea
why dr. dalton would be attending boys &apos; hockey games
and distributing these ?
i have no idea .
these don &apos;t have anything to do with her research .
is there any reason that she would be collecting samples of perspiration from adolescent boys ?
well , that &apos;s the group that she was focused on ,
but the only way to detect huntington &apos;s is with a blood test .
so all of her subjects were adolescent boys ages 12 to 14 ?
yes . she said she wanted to study juveniles .
seems like a pretty specific sample group .
yes , it is , but dr. dalton insisted .
excuse me . it &apos;s korsak .
please , feel free to use our conference room .
thank you for your time . we &apos;re very sorry for your loss .
hey , korsak . you at her apartment ?
yeah , but somebody got here first .
they left her research notebooks ,
but the computer &apos;s gone .
well , whoever tossed her apartment
probably had something to do with the murder .
we &apos;ll pack everything up .
the killer might have missed something .
okay , that &apos;s a lot of helmet pads .
what ?
used no @-@ drip helmet pads -- hundreds of them .
so , carla did drug trials in miami , annapolis , houston ,
corpus christi , portland ,
seattle , and boston , which is the same places
that she collected the sweaty helmet pads for .
and every city she picked was near an ocean .
yeah .
she was focused on three things --
12- to 14 @-@ year @-@ old male hockey players ,
huntington &apos;s disease , and coastal cities .
she was looking for somebody --
someone connected to these three things .
so , dr. carla dalton did not have
the genetic marker for huntington &apos;s .
what do you make of her data from her drug trials ?
well , let &apos;s see .
the research subjects are all anonymous .
they all have a number and identifying information ,
like this .
the subject is a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy from boston
who likes skateboarding and science fiction .
okay . why is this boy circled ?
14 @-@ year @-@ old from boston .
enjoys hockey and sailing .
where are the helmet pads from boston ?
not much use . they were in the trunk of her car .
hmm , how odd -- she was running dna
she extracted from sweat in the helmet pads
against dna from her huntington &apos;s test subjects .
and this is even odder .
what ?
she &apos;s comparing the results to her own dna .
i got more info on carla dalton .
she was originally from newport , rhode island .
csru is pulling prints from the submerged car
to compare to the 65 people you and frankie interviewed .
well , how did you get the prints from the parents
and the rink employees ?
jane had them all handle a photo of the victim .
hmm . genius .
there &apos;s a date engraved on this sailboat charm .
july 17 , 2001 .
july 17th . hang on . i just saw that .
frost , bring up carla &apos;s phone records for july 17th .
did she call anyone ?
a few boston numbers and a call to rhode island .
go back a year .
she called the same rhode island number .
go back another year .
there it is again .
run it .
it &apos;s registered to a jonathan mcknight .
yes , hello .
this is detective jane rizzoli from boston homicide .
oh , you are ?
well , we &apos;re investigating the murder of dr. carla dalton .
well , i &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
uh , yes . yeah , tomorrow morning would be fine .
okay . thank you very much , sergeant .
sergeant ?
jonathan mcknight is retired homicide detective .
he knew carla , and he wants to talk to us tomorrow .
i always worried that carla was right --
this is how it would end .
how what would end ?
i met carla 12 years ago .
this is carla with her sister , bridget .
bridget , her husband , michael ,
and their 2 @-@ year @-@ old son , todd .
all died in a boating accident , july 17 , 2001 .
well , wait . you &apos;re a retired homicide detective .
why would you be investigating a boating accident ?
carla was convinced it wasn &apos;t an accident .
did you find the bodies ?
only bridget &apos;s body washed up .
what was the cause of death ? drowning .
and what did carla think happened
to her brother @-@ in @-@ law and her nephew ?
she was convinced that michael killed his wife ,
faked his own death so he could take their son .
what did you think ?
that she didn &apos;t have any proof .
did carla know if michael ever threatened her sister ?
she said there was tension in the marriage ,
that bridget had some terrible illness .
huntington &apos;s disease .
yes , that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s passed down from the mother .
bridget &apos;s son has a 50 / 50 chance of inheriting it .
the intersecting circles .
14 @-@ year @-@ old boy who played hockey and lived near the ocean .
carla was looking for her nephew .
oh , yeah .
she was obsessed with finding todd
and bringing michael to justice .
i wanted to help her . i ...
there was nothing to go on .
why would michael stage a boating accident ?
i mean , there are easier ways
to leave your spouse and get custody .
well , after michael &apos;s presumed drowning ,
the investment firm he worked for
said he was under investigation
for embezzling millions .
so get rid of your wife , take your son and the money ,
and no one will look for you if you &apos;re dead .
did michael have any connection to hockey ?
he played semi @-@ pro . he was a real fanatic .
he &apos;d dress that boy in hockey shirts
and had him on skates as soon as he could walk .
you never change your hobbies ,
and michael had two of them -- sailing and hockey .
do you have michael &apos;s prints on file ?
michael leahy . right here .
this is everyone we interviewed .
that one . load that one up , frankie .
those are michael leahy &apos;s prints , all right .
pull up the dmv photo on the ones that match .
doug pierce . you recognize him ?
hmm . maybe .
he &apos;s had surgery .
his eyes are similar and so are his ears .
this is the same man .
so doug pierce is michael leahy .
we got him .
doug pierce remarried ,
i bet wife number two has no idea
he murdered wife number one .
he keeps a low profile .
works as an investment adviser from his home .
i sent uniforms , but he won &apos;t be there .
guy &apos;s on the run .
okay . all right , thanks .
his son , who has perfect attendance ,
didn &apos;t go to school today .
why would he voluntarily come in and do an interview with me ?
i remember doug pierce . he was calm .
well , he was buying time .
if he didn &apos;t show up , we &apos;d know it was him .
this way , he keeps us investigating ,
and he gets a head start .
he knows we &apos;ve got him on a watch list at the airport .
do a search .
see if doug pierce is a registered boat owner .
what do you know ?
you &apos;re not going with us .
yes , i am .
what are you gonna do if he starts to run ?
hobble .
thank you .
this is gonna be awesome .
yeah . not much wind .
no sign of michael .
the hatch is open . he &apos;s down below .
frankie , get the kid and the wife off , fast as you can .
ready ?
boston police ! get off the boat !
why ?
step off the boat , mrs. pierce .
wait . what &apos;s going on ? - mom --
luke , come on . you , too . come on .
okay . go , go , go . let &apos;s go . come on .
don &apos;t move .
it &apos;s over , michael .
michael ? what ? you have the wrong man .
carla see you at the ice rink ?
or did you go after her after you saw her ?
you saw her .
why couldn &apos;t she just let me be ?
she was watching the game , wasn &apos;t she ?
hoping one of those boys was her nephew .
like a freaking bloodhound .
12 years later , she tracks me down ,
shows up like a ghost at my son &apos;s game ,
wrecking my life .
just like her damn sister .
you know how she found you ?
you signed your son up for her drug trial .
five years she spent comparing her dna to hundreds of boys
trying to find her sister &apos;s son .
while also trying to find a cure for huntington &apos;s .
now , that a good person .
dad , why are they talking about huntington &apos;s ?
how do they know ?
sheila , get luke the hell out of here .
no , dad , what &apos;s happening ? who &apos;s carla ?
what did you tell him when he cried out for his mother ?
his mother ? she abandoned him .
i am his mother .
sheila , shut up and get him the hell out of here !
come on . - no , dad --
michael leahy , you are under arrest
for the murders of carla dalton and bridget dalton leahy .
dad ! dad !
i can still hear that poor kid yelling , &quot; dad ! &quot;
carla was so close . so tragic .
but it &apos;s beautiful , too , how much she loved her sister .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re not gonna offer me a glass of wine .
we could pretend it &apos;s france .
it &apos;s okay . i got a guy that can buy me a six @-@ pack .
i &apos;m kidding .
i hear you &apos;re a good cook .
yeah . you want me to make you something ?
are you planning to clean up after yourself ?
is that part of the deal ?
no .
we could order takeout .
you could help me throw out the boxes .
deal .
yeah .
deal .
