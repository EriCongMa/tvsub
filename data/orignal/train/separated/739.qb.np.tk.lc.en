hey , i apologize for what happened before .
not cool , bad call .
i &apos;ve been talking to the guys about boundaries , so
i totally get it .
perfectly fine , no problem .
do you have a tank top i could borrow ?
you look like you &apos;re about my size .
it &apos;s just that i &apos;m really low on clothes
right now &apos; cause i broke up with my boyfriend .
oh , god .
i caught him cheating , and i just , like , grabbed
whatever i could and ...
jess , you know what ?
i &apos;ll let you check my lost and found .
it &apos;s where i keep all the stuff that girls
leave behind in my room after we fo &apos;nicate .

i am so happy you &apos;re back .
you have made love to a lot of forgetful women .
oh , man , look at these .
oh , look at that .
rosh hashanah ,
&apos;06 .
yeah , nothing orthodox about what we did that night .
winston seems nice .
did he say anything to you about the room ?
what room ?
the big room .
i kind of took it from him when he left .
i used to be in the small room .
this happened in the small room .
twice .
never going back there again , jess .
he &apos;s never going to give you that room back .
come on , man , it &apos;s schmidt .
you know , they have a saying in latvia :
that guy is so stupid ,
we could easily take things away from him .
that &apos;s a saying ?
yeah , it is .
what do you think ?
jess ,
i &apos;ve been telling you this for weeks ,
but you got to call spencer and you got to get your stuff back .
unless , you know ,
unless you &apos;re scared .
no , i am not scared .
it &apos;s just complicated .
that stuff was , that stuff was ours
and i miss them ...
jess , look , it &apos;s a ball .

no , i can &apos;t call spencer , i haven &apos;t talked to him
since he cheated on me with that ho .
actually , that &apos;s not fair-- she might be a really nice ho .
i just don &apos;t want to get in a big fight with spencer .
i want to be friends with him eventually .
why do you want to be friends with your ex ?
i don &apos;t want to be friends with caroline ,
and all she did was rip me open and tear out my heart
with her perfect , perfect hands .
he has a power over me . it &apos;s like he &apos;s
a wizard and i &apos;m his mage .
i think it &apos;s his hair .
he has this , like , really beautiful hair , and whenever i see it ,
i get the whoo @-@ whoos .
oh , my god ,
i hate my life .
all right , guys--
look , jess , i know .
closure .
ouch .

i mean , when i moved out , obviously
there was a power vacuum .
yeah , i needed a leader .
i didn &apos;t know which end was up .
no , nick &apos;s a bottom-- you know what i mean .
absolutely .
say , winston , do all top dogs need the biggest room
or , i don &apos;t know , is that kind of cheesy , is it a little overkill ?
no , no , but i definitely see what you &apos;re saying , though , definitely .
um , every top dog is different ,
every top dog is different .
hey , schmidt , what , uh , kind of top dog are you ?
the kind with the big room .
i &apos;m so glad we &apos;re talking .

i spent six years trying to figure you out .
all you are is a guy
with really beautiful hair .
i &apos;m happy you cheated on me .
thank you .
because if you hadn &apos;t , i would have married you .
and then you would have hurt me all over again .

i &apos;ve been messing with you .
