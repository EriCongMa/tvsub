oh , what are you guys doing together ,
just the two of you ?
we &apos;re gonna raise money
on the quad to help with the oil spill .
we &apos;re making this display to show how serious the problem is .
oh , yeah . each drop represents
10,000 gallons of oil .
i &apos;m so glad this tragedy overshadowed haiti .
i didn &apos;t have any ideas for that .
yay to having fun in pairs !
what up , party people ?
oh , you got a band @-@ aid on your arm .
you should be more careful shaving .
i wax , dummy . this is from a blood test .
oh , no ... i knew it .
things are going too well for you .
oh , no , no . just a physical .
even a ferrari needs a tune @-@ up .
you guys moonshiners now ?
no , just the two of them .
we &apos;re raising money for the oil spill .
did you even know there was one ?
uh , yeah , i have the aol home page bookmarked .
did you even know about the ostrich that raised the tiger cub ?
troy , what &apos;s wrong ?
i just saw a dead body .
i told you not to use the east stairwell .
my pastor said it &apos;s meth season .
you know i &apos;m living with pierce now , so ...
this morning i went to do laundry in the garage ,
and i found his mom ...
dead .
oh !
troy , that &apos;s terrible !
well , she had been in bad shape for a while .
so i guess she crawled out there to die like a cat .
i &apos;ve never been that close to a dead body before .
oh !
oh , pumpkin !
she was so cold and gray .
i saw her underwear !
jeez ... who died ?
pierce , we &apos;re so sorry to hear about your mom .
why ?
losing a loved one is always difficult .
what ? my mom isn &apos;t dead .
but when troy found her , he said that--
well , her heart , lungs , kidneys , and brain
stopped working .
and another way of saying that would be ...
she &apos;s used up her organic body .
by ... dying in it .
wrong . she &apos;s alive .
mom was a part of my buddhist church .
she &apos;s a level five laser lotus , same as me .
when a level five &apos;s body stops functioning ,
it &apos;s vaporized in the temple of renewal
and stored in an energon pod .
in a few years , when our technology advances ,
they &apos;ll extract her body vapors
and recondense it to a solid state .
and before you know it ,
mom &apos;ll be back in the kitchen
making troy and me sandwiches .
pumpkin ! it &apos;s okay !
did you guys hear about that turtle in china ?
two packs a day .
第二季 第三集
look , if you guys just let me get to the can opener ,
i can feed you .
we have to do something about pierce .
he really thinks his mom isn &apos;t dead .
he &apos;s gone crazy .
... er ?
he won &apos;t even let us have a memorial service .
i was halfway done with the collage .
he hasn &apos;t cried yet , and from what i &apos;ve been told ,
that &apos;s not normal .
who &apos;s normal , abed ?
well , baptists are , but that &apos;s beside the point .
everybody has some sort of service for the departed--
eskimos , witch doctors , jewish people .
oh , cool . we made the list .
the point being , death needs to be coped with ,
not ignored , otherwise , why did mankind
但mankind因其雄性词特征常被女权主义者抨击
concoct all these religions ?
you wanna rephrase that ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry--humankind .
you think you &apos;re real smart , don &apos;t you ?
guys , guys , guys . did we learn nothing
from last christmas ?
i don &apos;t see much difference between pierce &apos;s religion
and anybody else &apos;s .
well , then you &apos;re not listening ,
because his has lasers .
look , you guys make fun of me for not caring about religion ,
but at least i &apos;m dedicate enough to not caring
to let you have your own beliefs .
can &apos;t pierce have his ?
can &apos;t you be cool like me ?
hello ?
he ends so many of his speeches that way .
morning , guys .
morning , pierce .
how &apos;s mom ?
terrific .
her body &apos;s being vaporized as we speak .
what does that feel like ?
they say it &apos;s the greatest feeling ever .
like the second when the fudge on your sunday is still hot
or when you &apos;re the first one to break in a new boob job .
also , you &apos;re free from the burden of your earthly body .
it is a burden .
greetings , class ! i am dr. ian duncan .
now , i don &apos;t normally teach anthropology ,
but apparently professor bauer tried to strangle mr. winger
and has been put on administrative leave with pay .
so ... what is anthropology ?
seriously , does anyone know ?
you , in the boobs .
it &apos;s the study of humanity .
wow . i thought psychology was a racket .
well , well .
i heard there was a drunk limey teachin &apos; this class .
i &apos;m not actually drunk , and i can prove it .
i blew beneath the legal limit just this morning .
that &apos;s reassuring .
also , i would like everyone here to know
that this man assaulted me last year .
and i have a restraining order
so i can have him expelled if he comes within ...
25 ...
feet .
abed .
yep .
proceed , dr. teeth .
it is the single largest disaster in recorded history .
it is worse than 50 exxon valdez spills !
you don &apos;t have to yell at us .
nobody is on the other side of this issue .
and the pelicans are covered in oil .
everyone likes pelicans . they bring babies .
that &apos;s storks .
oh , right .
well ... we still like them !
yeah , we do . um ...
i &apos;m gonna give you ...
another 20 .
thank you so much !
i &apos;m here for my test results ...
if you haven &apos;t framed them yet .
hi , gorgeous .
jeff .
you have something very infectious .
what ?
charm !
you got me , jackie .
seriously , everything looks great .
you &apos;re an incredible specimen .
even your moles look like little hearts .
the only thing i would suggest--
go see a doctor and get a prescription
for cholesterol medication .
what ? why ?
your cholesterol &apos;s a little high .
it &apos;s no big deal . eat some egg whites .
but i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
wait , did i accidentally tell you you have aids ?
&apos;cause i &apos;ve done that before .
it doesn &apos;t--i mean-- it doesn &apos;t--
i treat my body like a temple !
well , i can &apos;t be the first person to tell you
that the temple doesn &apos;t last forever .
i mean , it &apos;s made of hamburger .
this is a ... this is a temple of doom .
and you know what ? like the real temple of doom ,
it represents the inconvenient fact
that all good things--
be they people or movie franchises--
eventually collapse into sagging , sloppy ,
rotten piles of hard to follow nonsense .
i need to be alone .
uh ... you can do that by leaving .
whoo . okay .
let &apos;s get goin &apos; !
those paps aren &apos;t gonna smear themselves .
there is no god !
tell us how you really feel . am i right ?
morning , jeff .
did you get the results of your blood test ?
i &apos;m fine .
i figured .
thank you for wising us up yesterday .
we were being judgmental about pierce &apos;s religion .
but the fact is , jesus--
the fact is , everyone &apos;s dying .
and we all have these little notions
that we &apos;re the exception ,
but we &apos;re as wrong as we are dead .
that &apos;s nice .
how &apos;s it going with the little side project
that just the two of you are doing ?
it &apos;s great . i made $ 236,
plus britta &apos;s makes--
well , all totaled ,
we &apos;re close to 250 , right , britta ?
greendale cares about this issue .
yeah . i don &apos;t think that &apos;s it .
what do you mean ?
come on , annie .
you know guys are giving you money
because of the whole sexy schoolgirl routine .
i have a routine ?
yeah .
you know , the one where you use posture as an excuse
to stick out your chest
and you laugh at guys &apos; unfunny jokes ,
pretending not to know
that they have a sock at home with your name on it .
um ... that &apos;s me ,
and if a guy wants to make a puppet of me ,
that &apos;s hardly your concern .
well , i just may be an outsider here
because i was never called to participate ,
but it seems to me that britta &apos;s upset
because she &apos;s raising less money than you .
yeah , i &apos;m raising less money
because i &apos;m not jump @-@ starting date rapists .
bitter much ?
say &quot; bitter much &quot; much ?
say say &quot; bitter much much &quot; much ?
it &apos;s not my fault . i used to wear a back brace .
that &apos;s why .
what &apos;s with the lava lamp ?
it &apos;s not a lava lamp . it &apos;s my mom .
ha ho ho ! snap !
wait ... what ?
the temple finished vaporizing her .
this is mom &apos;s energon pod .
and that &apos;s her vapor in those little bubbles .
i &apos;m sure that thing was free , right ?
energon doesn &apos;t grow on trees , jeff .
it &apos;s harvested by super bees in a buddhist meteor crater .
which is at the foot of mount sky mall
in the sharper image valley ?
sorry , i overslept .
the sidewalk is more comfortable than it looks .
drunk . glug , glug , glug .
shut up . so where did we get to yesterday ?
you are drunk and stupid .
actually , ben , i do have a wee big of a headache ,
so if you could just--
isn &apos;t that interesting ?
i have a right to be here , sir .
oh , you do , you do ,
and i do hope you have very good hearing .
bastard !
so , where did we get to yesterday ?
we were talking about humanity ,
which starts with birth and ends with death .
true .
all life ends in death , which we , as a species ,
are cursed with knowing , resulting in ...
something .
again , this is really not my field .
professor , what would you say
might be the difference between
a religion and ... a cult ?
why don &apos;t we open that question to the floor ,
since i don &apos;t know
and the book for this class is expensive ?
well , i would say a cult might , for instance ,
sell you a tube of jell @-@ o
and tell you your mother is in it .
jeffrey !
i see--are we thinly veiling
a personal conflict and passing it off as a lesson ?
&apos;cause if so , please continue .
reformed neo @-@ buddhism is not a cult !
it is a new way of looking at the world ,
emphasizing empowerment .
like a video game ?
yes , troy .
very much like a video game .
you gain levels , and at a certain point ,
you actually can eat a ghost .
what ? i wanna eat a ghost !
no . no , do not let him pollute your brain
with this crap , troy .
it &apos;s okay to ask questions .
i have a question .
you said your mother went from a solid to a vapor .
do people in your religion ever take liquid form ,
like the creatures in the abyss
or children &apos;s tylenol ?
that &apos;s a good question .
actually , when buddha returns ,
we all take liquid form
and merge into a shimmering ocean of knowledge .
which , according to scripture , tastes like hawaiian punch .
i do like hawaiian punch .
hey , if you &apos;re really curious ,
come to my church &apos;s open hive tomorrow .
you know , wine , beer , free credit checks .
how much wine and beer per person ?
oh , come on !
we &apos;re having a con--what ?
excuse me . is this anesthesiology ?
yes . yes , it is .
just go with this .
it &apos;s really sad . anything helps .
so just anything you could give would be really ...
hey !
i like need you to save the pelicans .
they &apos;re all feathery and pelicany .
i wuv them .
thank you !
wow . it really is easy to raise money
when you sell out your gender .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s even easier
when you &apos;re not standing next to this .
hey , jerk ! you &apos;re stupid !
gimme money . i know more than you .
oh , i don &apos;t know anything .
i need boys .
saving the planet makes my back hurt .
oh , i obviously don &apos;t need guys for anything .
that &apos;s why i wear stripper boots during the day
and eat only celery and mustard for lunch !
oh , i never stop smiling .
i never start !
my sweaters keep shrinking !
i get up an hour early to ever @-@ so @-@ slightly curl my hair .
yeah , you &apos;re both so different .
skinny bitches .
hello , billionaire boys club .
mind if i ask what happened in class today ?
you pulled 40 minutes of anesthesiology out of your ass .
yeah , i did .
but , uh , i meant your elderly friend .
do you know how many times i haven &apos;t eaten a donut ?
i do not .
how much i got teased
in grade school for dabbing my pizza with napkins ?
i &apos;ve suffered .
i &apos;ve denied myself .
because the rules said if i did that ,
i would live longer .
but then , halfway through the game ,
i get this little update that it doesn &apos;t matter what i do .
i could eat powdered bran every day
while you suck down figgy pudding ,
and i still might die first .
it &apos;s unfair ! i want my donuts back .
well , i think you &apos;re being a little childish , and--
hold on a sec . i need to use my force field
to prevent chang from getting food .
where were we ? look ...
the way i see it , while claiming to have no religion ,
you were actually devoutly worshipping yourself .
and now that your god has high cholesterol ,
you &apos;re trying to kick pierce &apos;s in the balls .
you &apos;re right .
all i &apos;ve been trying to do is crush pierce &apos;s faith
to feel better about dying .
and ...
and now that i realize that that was my goal ...
mm @-@ hmm ?
i can really roll up my sleeves
and get it done .
there it is .
thank you !
you &apos;re welcome .
no , that wasn &apos;t what i--
actually , i don &apos;t care .
hey girls , guess who found buddha .
hey .
hi .
we &apos;re on our way to pierce &apos;s buddhist open hive .
but first i &apos;m taking these fellows for ice cream
as an apology for questioning pierce &apos;s faith .
pierce says there &apos;s this 69th flavor i need to try .
i am excited .
hey , guys , my car &apos;s over there .
cool .
guess what .
i &apos;m not actually taking them for ice cream .
i am taking them to the county morgue
where i have confirmed that
pierce &apos;s mother &apos;s very un @-@ vaporized corpse
will be lying on a stainless steel slab for all to see .
surprise ! welcome to reality .
welcome to death .
have fun .
good luck .
wow .
you guys are real downers .
i can &apos;t believe i made out with both of you .
ugh .
i &apos;ll check the basket .
sorry .
i almost arched my back a little .
i know you hate that .
no , i should count it . since i &apos;m a calculating bitch .
no , i should , since i &apos;m the one
who &apos;s whoring out our gender !
give that back to me .
i &apos;m gonna count it !
let go !
gimme that !
oh , yeah ? think this is funny ?
you think it &apos;s funny ?
get off of me !
you little brat !
i hate you !
now , this is why i came to america .
maybe we should listen to some music .
no problem .
i brought the jam book from the pierce mobile .
i could play some of the old stuff ,
but you guys would make fun of me .
so ...
i &apos;ll throw ya ... a bone and put in some loggins .
this ice cream place is far .
trust me . it &apos;s worth it .
what &apos;s this ?
this is mom &apos;s handwriting .
is that what you were doing in the garage ,
you silly goose ?
she spent her last moments alive making a cd ?
that &apos;s gangster !
pierce , you found the cd ,
which means ... i &apos;m dead .
vaporized .
i &apos;m not vaporized . i &apos;m gone , pierce .
gone forever and ...
that &apos;s how i like it .
life is only worth a damn because it &apos;s short .
it &apos;s designed to be consumed , used ,
spent , lived , felt .
we &apos;re supposed to fill it with every mistake
and miracle we can manage .
and then we &apos;re supposed to let go .
i can &apos;t force you to do that for yourself , pierce .
but you can &apos;t force me to stay .
and if you unscrew the top of that stupid thing ,
you &apos;ll see it was made in china .
i love you , son .
good @-@ bye .
i &apos;ll play myself out .
well , that proves one thing .
that woman was really losing her marbles toward the end .
you ... seriously still think she &apos;s in there ?
why wouldn &apos;t i ?
no reason .
so ... where &apos;s this ice cream place ?
yeah .
oh ... um ...
you know , the-- i think i ...
actually saw a better one back there .
the place i was gonna take you was ... kinda depressing .
oh , can we get a little more sawdust on that storm gutter ?
thank you !
i &apos;m sorry--
i &apos;m sorry too .
i just got jealous of you .
no , but you totally called me on what i was doing ,
and ... i only kissed jeff
because i wanted to see if i could do it ,
because i wanna be cool and sexy like you .
i can &apos;t believe how gross i am .
i only slept with jeff because i hate myself ,
and that &apos;s why i got after you for raising money .
i &apos;m twice as gross .
and you know the reason
that we raised more money in five minutes of oil wrestling
than we did in two days of fundraising ?
because ... men are even grosser ?
and when we forget that , they win .
yeah . all right .
all right , all right .
yeah , do it .
oh , so you got actual ice cream .
yeah . with peanut butter and hot fudge .
what the hell , right ? nobody lives forever .
no offense .
nah , think what you want . it &apos;s a free country .
i barely saw this week , abed ,
what have you been up to ?
not much .
what ?
whoa ! busted ! 25 feet !
which puts you in violation
of this restraining order i filed against you
for abusing me with your restraining order !
mutually assured destruction .
well played , chang .
thank you .
that means a lot .
do you mind getting a quick photo of me
with the oily coeds ?
center button .
okay .
you &apos;re the man .
yeah , no problem .
wanna get a- on tv watching ,
stay here for more community , right now at nbc .
he ... not a projection .
he &apos;s the british guy pretending to be tom berenger .
it was a mislead .
that &apos;s the whole point of &quot; inception . &quot;
subversion of reality .
he hasn &apos;t seen it yet !
