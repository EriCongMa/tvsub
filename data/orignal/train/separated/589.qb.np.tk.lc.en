greendale community college
is represented by two separate ,
yet equally important types of people :
the goofballs that run around stirring up trouble ,
and the eggheads that make a big deal out of it .
these are their stories .
you &apos;ll be better off without her .
she was perfect . warm , smart , beautiful .
i &apos;m never gonna find another dental hygienist like that .
well , you should stop hitting on her .
hey , she &apos;s the one putting
her hands in my mouth .
over here .
move along , nothing to see here .
that &apos;s the first time those words have actually been true .
ms. edison , when you called me down here at midnight ,
i expected more than a yam .
specifically since you said , &quot; there &apos;s been a murder . &quot;
our yam was murdered .
if it &apos;s any consolation , she got me here
on a very misleading text message .
jeff , technically , you are about to be screwed
in the biology room because our final project
has been destroyed .
all right , look , i &apos;m sorry for your loss .
i know you guys put the work in ,
so you &apos;ll get a passing grade .
a passing grade ?
like a &quot; c &quot; ?
why don &apos;t i just get pregnant at a bus station ?
that was going to be an a @-@ plus yam .
i can &apos;t give an a @-@ plus to everyone
whose yam falls off a counter .
somebody did this to us .
in science , we call that a hypothesis .
you find something to back it up and we can talk .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i was watching mama &apos;s family .
what happened ?
our yam was killed .
but professor kane says we can still get an &quot; a &quot;
if we figure out who did it .
he did not say that .
he basically did .
you let me handle the nitty gritty .
in the meantime , i need somebody to drum up suspects .
i can help you with that .
i watch crime shows when i &apos;m bored .
you boys , canvas for witnesses , establish a time frame
and motive and bring me a suspect .
you &apos;ve got 48 hours before the trail runs cold ,
so start with the last person to see that yam alive .
yes , ma &apos;am .
understood .
it &apos;s been a long 15 years .
looks like it &apos;s gonna be a late night .
how &apos;d we manage to pull the short straw ?
it &apos;s not a short straw .
it &apos;s a hot potato .
yeah , well , looks pretty cold to me .
cold ? or dead ?
survey says--
we can &apos;t both do the zinger .
sorry .
第三季第十七集
okay ,
okay , five @-@ to @-@ one on the black guy .
that &apos;s offensive .
fine , six @-@ to @-@ one .
hello , boys .
youth ! scatter !
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , slow down , pierce .
mind if we ask you a couple of questions ?
sure , i always say you guys should ask me more questions .
did you water our biology yam last night ?
of course i watered it .
it was my turn , wasn &apos;t it ?
i hold up my end .
did you hold it or drop it ?
okay , whoa , i had nothing to do with that .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t even get in the room .
make up your mind , pierce .
did you water the yam or weren &apos;t you there ?
okay , i lied about watering it .
i got there too late , the doors were already locked .
why were you late ?
i ... fell asleep in a sunbeam .
likely story .
actually it is .
i used to live with him , it &apos;s kind of adorable .
look , why are you looking at me for this ?
it was my yam too .
you should be talking to somebody
who would wanna hurt us .
and who &apos;s that ?
duh @-@ doy !
todd .
last night , i was home by 9 : 15,
helped elly with her geography and then went straight to bed .
sounds like you keep a pretty tight schedule .
a valuable side effect of military service .
in iraq , keeping a tight schedule saved lives .
ah , what happened , todd ?
cut yourself on an extra sharp oscar wilde play ?
oh , this ? it &apos;s a burn .
home ec class . muffin .
what kind of muffin ?
blueberry .
why not raisin ?
that wasn &apos;t the assignment .
you can dance all day , todd ,
but sooner or later , the music &apos;s gonna change .
look , even if i wanted to hurt your yam , i couldn &apos;t .
i went by the bio room at 8 : 10 to chart my yam &apos;s growth .
the door was already locked .
there &apos;s a lot of that going around .
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s true .
i had to take a picture of my yam through the door .
see ?
your yam was fine when i left .
i transferred or &quot; downloaded &quot;
todd &apos;s photograph to this computer ,
and as you &apos;ll see , with a few adjustments , i can make
the entire image ...
old west color .
i don &apos;t know . i thought it was cool .
britta , zoom in there .
there &apos;s a clock on the wall .
eight plus two times five--
ten after 8 : 00 .
i &apos;m gifted in other ways .
that jibes with everyone else we talked to .
it seems like the classroom door gets locked at 8 : 00 .
which means whoever did the crime--
got in there before the doors were locked
and stayed there for hours .
i was gonna say , &quot; had a key . &quot;
last year , i came in after hours a couple of times
to finish a pinata for advanced spanish .
i had to borrow a key from the front office .
and sign a log .
i can also help .
as a psych major , i could pr--
any student can check out a key as long as they &apos;re
currently taking classes and show school i.d.
the guy we &apos;re looking for had a key
to the bio room monday night .
monday night ? rings a bell .
i &apos;ll check the log .
sorry , this place is a mess .
is this about your yam ?
i heard about that .
it &apos;s a damn shame .
mine just bloomed yesterday .
congratulations .
ooh , there she is .
monday night , one biology room key checked out by ...
magnitude .
so you &apos;re saying you did check out a key ,
but it was inside your backpack when someone stole it
off a table in the library while you were using the bathroom
and you haven &apos;t seen it since .
pop pop !
perfect , so now we gotta solve a robbery too .
well , whoever did it likes to steal backpacks
off tables in the library .
only one way to catch a dirtbag like that .
well , time to visit the restroom .
i found that backpack .
hey , idiot , guess what .
we don &apos;t care about the backpack .
dead yam , big deal .
order some ketchup .
that doesn &apos;t make sense . you don &apos;t order ketchup .
it &apos;s a condiment !
troy , troy , hey , walk it off !
troy , walk it off !
sorry , my friend , he &apos;s a bad cop .
yeah .
i &apos;m a good cop .
oh , good .
you can trust me .
okay , well--hey !
i &apos;m not falling for that .
and you got nothing on me .
and i don &apos;t have to stay here , &apos; cause you &apos;re not cops .
he &apos;s right . you &apos;re not cops .
i &apos;d say our hands are tied , but we basically have no hands .
but he &apos;s our man though , right ?
well he ain &apos;t innocent .
look , i &apos;ll try to keep him busy .
you guys go to the lab , see if they figured out
how our yam met its masher .
i can both see and hear you .
the yam &apos;s vascular cylinder is completely disintegrated .
any possibility it happened naturally ?
sure , if the gardener &apos;s joseph mengele .
look at the root system .
this level of smushing is consistent
with someone stepping on the yam after it was dropped .
so whoever did this was angry .
hey , i just cut &apos; em open .
you want motive , talk to a shrink .
what i can tell you is that for a raw yam to get it this bad ,
you need more than gravity .
you need a boot .
we have to tell professor kane .
there &apos;s nothing here to connect to star @-@ burns .
he &apos;d have to confess .
oh , yeah , sure .
maybe if we ask him nice ,
he &apos;ll write us a love letter too .
well , whoever did do this does owe you guys a letter .
an &quot; a. &quot;
this yam was about to bloom .
damn .
we named the yam &quot; pam . &quot;
it rhymed .
that star @-@ burns stole magnitude &apos;s key ,
it &apos;s not enough .
but we know star @-@ burns did it .
keep the change , garret .
you know what ? keep the hot dog .
you &apos;re telling me after all this ,
our suspect &apos;s gonna slip away
on the technicality that we &apos;re not police ?
okay , look , you don &apos;t need authority
to get a confession .
you need leverage . something to hold over his head .
like what ?
he &apos;s star @-@ burns .
break into his locker .
you &apos;ll find enough dirt to bury him .
jeff , that &apos;s not ethical .
oh , so now you &apos;re finding your softness ?
i say do what you have to do .
it &apos;s too late to get compassionate .
we only have time to get justice .
i really shouldn &apos;t be doing this .
and you &apos;re sure you heard a kitten meowing in here ?
not anymore , so hurry up .
whoa , nelly !
clean up on aisle &quot; busted . &quot;
why do they always r--
why do they always--
you go ahead .
why do they always run ?
there you go .
move !
not police business !
hey , knock much ?
kiss me !
what ?
i &apos;ll explain later .
no .
i &apos;ll explain later .
the explanation isn &apos;t the issue .
oh , all right , all right .
look , i @-@ i swiped some beakers for the meth lab
that i &apos;m building in the trunk of my car .
but that &apos;s it .
i didn &apos;t kill any yam .
tell it to the biology professor .
oh , now wait !
i know who did it .
i left the door open and someone came in .
he dropped your yam .
will you tell our teacher who it was ?
if you promise i won &apos;t get in trouble
for stealing that meth lab stuff .
sure , whatever .
fine .
pinky swear ?
it was the guy with the weird head .
the army guy .
i heard the jar break and then
i saw him running out of the room holding his hand .
looked like he cut himself .
well , well , well .
look at this , abed .
he weaves baskets and lies .
what &apos;s this about ?
it &apos;s about the killing of our biology yam .
will you please come with us ?
but i &apos;m in the middle of making a handle .
he wants it the hard way . tell him what shirley said .
todd jacobson , you have the right to do whatever you want .
nothing you say or do can be used against you by anyone ,
but we &apos;d really like it if you came with us .
please and thank you .
make it quick , folks .
i have a class in five minutes
and none of you guys are in it .
after conducting a full investigation ,
my study group now has definitive proof that todd ,
with malice of forethought , smashed our yam .
that &apos;s a serious allegation .
i hope you can back it up .
we can place him in the building monday night .
he has a mysterious bandage on his hand ,
and we have and eyewitness who saw todd drop the jar and flee .
well , todd , what do you have to say ?
i just wanna--
don &apos;t answer that , soldier !
this man is an american hero .
and who are you ?
i &apos;m lieutenant colonel archwood , united states army .
i had the pleasure of commanding this young man in iraq .
i &apos;m staying on his couch this weekend
while i &apos;m in town for a wedding .
i am a licensed attorney , a veteran of two wars ,
and i &apos;d like to know why in hell he &apos;s being arrested .
mr. winger , what is the intention here ?
simple . when todd smashed our yam , he stole an &quot; a &quot; from us .
we want it back .
you mean if he smashed the yam .
all you have is the word of this mr. star @-@ burns ,
who offers up no explanation as to why he was at the scene .
how about it , jeffrey ?
what was star @-@ burns doing there ?
we agreed to withhold that information
as part of a pinky swear with the witness .
a pinky swear ?
this is ludicrous .
this whole school is ludicrous .
who honors the pinky swear of a degenerate
over the word of a decorated soldier ?
i &apos;m inclined to agree with the man in uniform .
shocker .
jeffrey .
tell us what star @-@ burns was doing in that classroom ,
or your group can take an &quot; f. &quot;
hold up , hold up , hold up .
i grade my students .
now , what star face was doing there is irrelevant .
what matters is what he saw .
i &apos;m upholding the pinky swear .
what ?
yo , man , you spent your life in the army .
i spent mine in prison .
two places where a man &apos;s word is only as good as his uniform .
now out here , it &apos;s supposed to be different .
and in my class , it will be .
you two can plead your case to the class
and let them decide your grades .
professor ... thank you .
it &apos;s not a favor , mr. winger .
a man &apos;s gotta have a code .
awesome .
see you in class .
uniform .
shirley did some more digging .
turns out todd &apos;s yam never even sprouted .
goes to motive .
and star @-@ burns puts todd in the classroom at 8 : 10 .
opportunity .
add to that a cut on the hand
and the winger charm , we might get an a @-@ plus @-@ plus .
we still have a lot of work to do .
oh , i think you &apos;ve done enough .
colonel archwood got to star @-@ burns .
threatened to involve the real cops .
now star @-@ burns is in the wind .
he &apos;s our only witness .
that what you guys do in here ?
you push your little papers
and you make your little speeches ,
and in the end another dirtbag walks ?
huh ? huh ? !
abed ! abed !
abed ! walk it off !
walk it off !
i &apos;m sorry about my partner .
he--he &apos;s been on edge ever since we switched .
annie , that class already hates us .
if we go in there without a case , they &apos;ll fail us .
we have proof our yam was murdered
and now you find your softness ?
it &apos;s eat or be eaten when that &apos;s convenient ,
but when the going gets tough , winger gets nervous , huh ?
we have no case , annie .
it &apos;s too late to get one , jeff .
we only have time to get justice .
甘薯谜案 第一部分
tell us what happened next , todd .
i disarmed the ied
and returned the child to his mother .
she offered to give me her only possession--a wooden chair--
but i refused .
i was only doing my duty and we had
plenty of chairs at the base .
and for your valor , you were awarded a bronze star .
in fact , you have an absolutely glowing service record .
don &apos;t you , private ?
i do my best .
you do more than that , soldier .
certainly more than this witness
who supposedly saw you kill the yam .
a man who for all we know
is a holocaust @-@ denying , 9 / 11 pedophile .
objection .
withdrawn .
one last question .
did you intentionally break into
the biology room with the express purpose
of killing the study group &apos;s yam ?
no , sir , i did not .
thank you , soldier .
and god bless your testimony .
your witness .
tell me , todd ,
do you consider yourself a hero ?
oh , no .
of course not .
a hero doesn &apos;t call himself a hero .
a hero gets called a hero because of what he does .
and with your impressive record ,
not even i could deny you the title .
objection , she &apos;s clearly ramping up to something .
objection , that &apos;s not a real objection .
objection , i hate the both of you .
you may proceed , ms. edison , but do so with caution .
need i remind you this is not a courtroom ?
i spent the majority of last night
going over your records with mr. winger ,
scouring them for the slightest mistake , the tiniest slip up .
and i gotta tell you , todd . couldn &apos;t find a thing .
not one little smudge .
except , of course , for one pesky yam that just wouldn &apos;t grow .
that had to weigh on your soul , didn &apos;t it , todd ?
maybe a little .
a little ?
a big orange splotch on your perfect record ?
i bet that pissed you right off , didn &apos;t it ?
is that why you hit your wife ?
withdrawn .
is that why you drink and pop pills ?
withdrawn .
are you a virgin ? withdrawn .
did you ...
kill our yam to settle the score , huh ?
did stomping on its roots make you feel like a big man ?
no , it didn &apos;t .
i mean , i didn &apos;t--
todd , zip it .
no , you zip it , uncle knobby .
i &apos;m not fighting your wars anymore .
listen to me , todd .
i know how scary a failing grade can be ,
but this one dead yam won &apos;t tarnish your record .
what will tarnish it is lying to your class ,
to your teacher , and to me .
the american citizen you &apos;ve sworn to protect .
come on , todd .
stop disappointing me .
defuse the ied of dishonesty .
it was an accident .
i just wanted to look at your yam ,
but when i picked up the jar , it burnt me and i dropped it .
booyah !
that &apos;s how it &apos;s done !
todd ,
i &apos;m telling your mother .
that &apos;s right .
always have an exit strategy .
i think i &apos;ve heard enough .
professor kane , may we have a sidebar in your office ?
i want a mistrial .
just give us a &quot; c , &quot; give todd a &quot; c. &quot;
excuse me ?
what ?
can we take a sidebar in this sidebar ?
jeff , we &apos;re about to get our &quot; a. &quot;
todd didn &apos;t do it .
um , he just confessed , dummy .
he said the jar burned him ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
people don &apos;t half @-@ confess to crimes .
look , when we started this ,
you were after the truth .
and then i convinced you it was more important to win .
don &apos;t be like me .
a man &apos;s got to have a code .
i can only assume there is a female equivalent to that .
a &quot; codette &quot; or something .
but--
it &apos;s not worth getting an &quot; a &quot;
if an innocent man might get an &quot; f. &quot;
okay , i heard all of that and i accept .
all right .
after speaking to the wronged parties , i &apos;ve decided to--
uh , if it pleases the bio class ,
i have closing arguments .
of course you do .
why was it so hard for all of us to grow a yam ?
it &apos;s just a stupid yam in a stupid jar .
we &apos;re all fully @-@ grown adults
failing a kindergarten project .
can i object ?
i &apos;ll allow it .
sustained .
and all this time we assumed
our yam was targeted ,
that someone had stomped its roots maliciously .
but what if-- what if our yam &apos;s roots
were dead before they hit the ground ?
hey , that &apos;s mine !
look at it .
everyone look .
smushed without being stepped on .
because it didn &apos;t have to be stepped on .
because it was boiled .
someone has been pouring boiling water into our jars at night .
no one noticed because the water cooled off by morning .
boiling water is the icicle stabbing of yam killing .
ooh , but that didn &apos;t--
this yam isn &apos;t boiled .
vicki ?
i don &apos;t--i didn &apos;t do it , i swear !
i boiled the yams .
vicki &apos;s yam never sprouted
and i didn &apos;t want her to fail ,
so i threw off the grading curve
so she wouldn &apos;t have to go to summer school
and we can finally have sex in my parents &apos; cabin .
god forgive me , i did it for love !
holy crap .
we are definitely dissecting pine cones next year .
neil has agreed to retake biology over the summer
and his status as keymaster has been revoked .
after all the politics and procedure , in the end ,
the case really was about biology .
told you it was an important subject .
hello ?
i understand .
star @-@ burns got rear @-@ ended
and the meth lab in his trunk exploded .
he &apos;s dead .
abed ?
yeah ?
why don &apos;t we have bunk bed conversations ?
i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re best friends , we share a bunk bed .
seems like we should be having them all the time .
you start .
okay . why do you think they call them &quot; bunk beds &quot; ?
where &apos;s the word &quot; bunk &quot; come from ?
i don &apos;t know .
i think it comes from the word &quot; bunker . &quot;
so when is your apartment done being fumigated ?
oh , it was done about a week ago .
then why are you still here ?
i brought you some warm milk .
there you go .
* troy and abed , off to dreamland *
* catching the train to sleepytown *
* and when they wake up *
* the dean &apos;ll be here , staring at you . *
* sweet deans . *
that &apos;s nice ... i guess .
