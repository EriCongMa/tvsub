one steak sandwich
and a cheeseburger with muenster cheese .
we &apos;re out of muenster .
oh , since when ?
well , let &apos;s see , the diner opened in &apos; 82 .
so &apos; 82 .
hi , sorry but we &apos;re out of muenster .
seriously , dude ?
i wanted muenster .
sorry , we have cheddar , swiss or american .
i hate cheddar
and swiss blows .
well ... then american ?
american cheese ?
接近垃圾食品 很符合美国小孩的胃口 &#93;
what am i , at grade school ?
yeah , go to the principal &apos;s office .
i can &apos;t have another idiot up my ass right now .
it &apos;s at capacity .
max , i got this .
would you like to see the menu again ?
this is crap , okay , i wanted muenster .
well , i wanted to be running a fortune 500 company
instead of waiting on a toxic man @-@ child like yourself .
but , we can &apos;t always get what we want .
so , order something else , put it in your pie hole
and get on with your damn life .
welcome to waitress .
we &apos;ve been expecting you .
here you go , table ten , earl .
have any exciting plans for tomorrow ?
just trying to not die in my sleep , max .
how about you ?
i &apos;m going to visit caroline &apos;s horse .
he was adopted by a rich white lady
who could give him everything we couldn &apos;t afford to .
which is everything .
white people will adopt anything .
i figured out the best way to go see chestnut .
we take the j train to the 4,
the 4 to grand central ,
change trains to riverdale
and walk three blocks to his fancy new stable .
sounds exotic . do i need a travel shot ?
no , but there &apos;s a dicey underpass at grand central
where we might get shot .
i am so excited to see my baby again .
me too .
in the lifetime movie version ,
《 美女上错身 》 就是这台播放的 &#93;
we get there and chestnut likes his new home better
and then we cry .
excuse me , hi .
sorry to bother you .
i &apos;m rhya , i &apos;m a little embarrassed .
i just got my period .
mazel tov .
do either of you have a tampon ?
not me .
i just go off into the woods and don &apos;t come out until it &apos;s over .
i have one .
i &apos;m so sorry to bother you guys .
no problem , &quot; sisterhood of the traveling panty shields &quot;
讲述四个好姐妹同穿一条牛仔裤的故事 &#93;
actually , no , i don &apos;t have one .
here &apos;s a quarter ,
there &apos;s a tampon machine in the ladies &apos; room .
thanks .
pick up , table six .
i couldn &apos;t help overhear .
i have tampon .
oleg , why do you have a tampon ?
same reason i carry a lighter , even though i don &apos;t smoke .
feels good to be the hero .
sorry , again , but do you have any more change ?
it &apos;s 75 cents .
it &apos;s a quarter .
75 . says so on the machine .
it better not or i &apos;m about to rage against the machine .
what ?
han , i need to see you in here now .
but that is the ladies &apos; room .
you &apos;re fine .
women bring their little boys in here all the time .
everybody decent ?
man in the ladies &apos; room .
i apologize for personal intrusion .
you don &apos;t have to cover your eyes .
it &apos;s a ladies &apos; room , not a solar eclipse .
max , why do you want to see me
in this inappropriate meeting place ?
this is why . the tampon machine .
oh , this is not man topic .
i do not wish to discuss time of the month
when ladies must chase the cotton mouse .
chase the cotton mouse ?
geeze , where &apos;d you get your sex education ?
lambchop &apos;s playalong ?
han , you changed the price of tampons ?
yes , this is not appropriate talk .
no , this is not appropriate action .
they &apos;ve been a quarter forever .
look how old this machine is .
harriet tubman used to get her tampons here .
i &apos;m a businessman .
emphasis on the man .
i do not belong in here .
hey , hey !
don &apos;t make me chase you , you little khaki mouse .
look , han , everyone knows there are certain things
that people need in an emergency
that you never raise the price on .
things like what ?
off the top of my head ,
tampons and 40 @-@ ounce beers .
max , why are you so upset ?
it is only two more quarters .
han , that &apos;s a 200 % price hike .
that &apos;s outrageous .
you &apos;re taking advantage of women .
if men were the ones who got periods ,
tampons would be thrown free from floats
like mardi gras beads .
期间会有无数的彩车免费送彩珠 &#93;
i went to mardi gras once-- i was 11 .
my mom and her new boyfriend wanted to go ,
and they needed a designated driver .
earl , i need a man &apos;s opinion .
is it my right to raise the price
of any product in my diner ?
what product are we talking about ?
tampons .
oh , brother .
uh , you gotta just relax and butt out .
trust me .
i been in this situation a long time .
remember aunt flo ?
that was my aunt .
han , just because you can take advantage of a business situation ,
doesn &apos;t mean you should .
it is law of supply and demand .
fine , then i demand you roll back the price on the supply .
come on han , don &apos;t be so 1 % about it .
you think occupy wall street was a big deal ?
抗议者的口号是 &quot; 我们代表社会的99 % 我们不再忍受那1 % 的贪婪与腐败 &quot; &#93;
wait till you see occupy tampon .
we only protest once a month ,
but it &apos;s an intense five to seven days .
got it . found the milk .
and i found it even faster than the butter .
you know they &apos;re not hiding it from you .
it &apos;s a grocery store , not a sorority scavenger hunt .
grocery shopping is so fun .
when i was little , i always wondered
where this stuff came from .
what &apos;s that ?
birthday card for my mom .
aww , let me see .
&quot; get better soon &quot; ?
i thought you said it was a birthday card .
it is , that &apos;s the only one that seemed
appropriate for our relationship .
do you really want your mom to get
a get well card on her birthday ?
okay ... here &apos;s one with a strawberry , that &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s really about the 50 bucks inside anyway .
that makes me sad .
sad ? i can fix that .
have a treat , it &apos;ll perk you right back up .
max , you just stabbed a bag of candy .
that &apos;s okay , they &apos;ll just think
a gang came through and did it .
a candy gang ?
what , like the sour patch kids ?
just step away and pretend you didn &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s what you do .
we just need to grab ten boxes
of duncan hines cake mix and we &apos;re done .
why would we need to do that ?
why do you think ? to make the cupcakes .
i thought the cupcakes were homemade .
they are , i make them in my home .
you &apos;ve been using a boxed cake mix ?
relax , i only use it when i &apos;m tired .
and i add a secret ingredient of my own to the mix
that makes them irresistible .
so you have no shame using the store @-@ bought mix ?
i &apos;ve no shame about anything .
shame is overrated like ke $ ha .
in fact , they should rename shame &quot; keshame &quot;
i just bought a ke $ ha album , i &apos;m so keshamed .
shouldn &apos;t there be someone to do this for us ?
oh , he &apos;s probably in the aisle
cleaning up after the candy gang .
there was no candy gang in here tonight .
that was a sneaky customer , now wasn &apos;t it ?
hey , look .
for chestnut , i can &apos;t wait .
i got him the kind with tops on them , like bugs bunny .
he &apos;ll be so excited when he sees the two of us tomorrow .
i know .
i was talking about me and the carrots .
all right now , your total is $ 70.49 .
wow , that seems like a lot .
i don &apos;t make the prices , now do i ?
no , i was just commenting .
well , it &apos;s not cnn now , is it ?
here , give her the coupons .
the coupons ?
yeah , here .
max , you use coupons ?
i had no idea .
you &apos;re looking at me like i &apos;m on to catch a predator .
勾引恋童癖变态 最后诱拐他进摄影棚 &#93;
we don &apos;t need to use those , i have my tip money right here .
what are you talking about , i have coupons .
here , take them .
i @-@ i have--
i can &apos;t , i don &apos;t want to .
i &apos;ve fallen so far , i can &apos;t fall any further .
don &apos;t make me .
there &apos;s no need to go down a keshame spiral .
hi , she has coupons .
oh , now you tell me you have coupons ?
should have told me before , now shouldn &apos;t ya ?
i didn &apos;t wanna tell you at all , she made me .
now didn &apos;t ya ?
look , it &apos;s not a big deal .
lots of people use coupons .
coupons are for--
poor people , yes .
like us .
people who stand at the cash register and say things like ,
&quot; wow , $ 70 ? that seems like a lot . &quot;
your new total is $ 12.70
wait , it just went from $ 70 to $ 12 ?
just like that ?
the same food for less money ?
the exact same food ?
how is that even possible ?
you used coupons , now didn &apos;t ya .
max , coupons are genius .
i &apos;m late , i know .
i just got a text from chestnut .
&quot; where are you ?
i &apos;m wearing my best suit . &quot;
he spelled suit with a four ,
but that &apos;s pretty good for a horse .
i have a good reason .
15 chicken pot pies .
regular price : $ 1.47 .
coupon price : free !
&apos;cause i bought 15 and used the double coupon in @-@ store sale combo .
折价券上的折扣加倍 &#93;
listen to me with the lingo already .
reminds me of my first day interning on wall street .
chicken pot pies ?
you don &apos;t even like them .
what does it matter if i like them or not ?
they were free .
it &apos;s free money .
who doesn &apos;t like free money ?
i don &apos;t know about free money ,
but this is like watching someone
free base for the first time .
chestnut &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s not a big deal .
ooh , oh , i just got another text from chestnut .
&quot; i &apos;m so lonely , i just tried smoking . &quot;
we can go tomorrow .
in the lifetime movie version ,
we just missed the day we were appointed by the court ,
and chestnut &apos;s new parents move him out of town .
and we cry .
i get it , it &apos;s just that after last night ,
i woke up fascinated by the concept of coupons .
so i did some research .
i found this woman online
who calls herself the williamsburg coupon queen .
only she calls them &quot; cue @-@ pons . &quot;
is that the correct way to pronounce it ?
eh , i &apos;m gonna go with her way
after all , she is the queen .
canned pumpkin ?
ten cans , double coupon , five cents each .
great , &apos; cause i &apos;m always lying in bed at night
thinking i wish i could crack open a can of pumpkin .
oh , and i found a coupon for you to send your mom
an edible arrangement for her birthday .
a pretty pineapple daisy says so much more than cash in a card .
and it &apos;s for 40 % off the regular price .
that &apos;s perfect because my mom was 40 % off a regular mom .
and max , i do have something else for you in this bag .
somet &apos;hing that &apos;ll make you very happy .
canned yams for when i get tired of canned pumpkin ?
better , look .
look out , han lee .
i &apos;m about to get my tamp on .
well well , if it isn &apos;t everything that &apos;s wrong with the current economy ,
in a boys &apos; v @-@ neck sweater .
oh , what do you think you are doing ?
oh , just putting straws in the container ...
in case , uh ...
just in case a woman might suddenly need a straw
and not have 75 cents .
those are not straws .
they do not belong in public .
didn &apos;t your mother ever teach you
that is secret , no @-@ no private lady thing ?
you can &apos;t even say the name .
come on wall street , if you can sell it ,
you should be able to bring yourself to say it .
i will never speak of it .
just say it . tampon , tampon , tampon .
what &apos;s the big deal ?
in ukraine , there are pop songs about it .
* she &apos;s so pretty , she &apos;s so grouchy . *
that is inappropriate counter display .
you take it down .
you take down the price and i will .
no , it is free market .
i charge what i want .
i am the boss .
max , someone left a stack of newspapers filled with cue @-@ pons ,
and look , a double for duncan hines .
could this day get any better ?
oh , and tables four , seven and eight want their checks .
okay .
have &apos; em ready right here .
max , no , that is private !
here &apos;s your check .
and a little something extra ,
compliments of women without three quarters everywhere .
thank you very much .
i don &apos;t know about your flow ,
so i gave you a regular and a super .
max , have you no shame ?
nope .
ladies , at that time of the month ,
i invite you to think of this man .
this man , han lee , right over here .
the man who thinks your menses should be more expenses .
okay , okay , i will lower the price
back to a quarter .
and that is end of discussion , period .
oh .
tampons for everyone .
max , you are the norma rae of feminine hygiene .
带领工人对抗资本家的剥削 &#93;
it &apos;s so windy .
choosing coupon shopping over going to see your son again ?
that &apos;s a keshame .
in the lifetime movie version ,
this is where they take you away as an unfit mother .
and i don &apos;t cry .
i &apos;m sorry , but i just saw
that all these cake mix cue @-@ pons expire today .
i &apos;ll be real quick .
ten minutes , in and out .
if i had a cue @-@ pon for every time i heard that from a guy .
here , start going through these papers
and look for the cake mix double cue @-@ pon .
if i combine these with the in @-@ store bonus ,
not only will we get the lower cue @-@ pon mix price ,
but they will actually give us $ 23 back !
i &apos;ll give you $ 24 to stop saying cue @-@ pon .
come on , start pulling out the ones for the cake mix .
it &apos;ll be a breeze .
no , that was a breeze .
my cue @-@ pons !
the fact that you &apos;re more worried about your coupons
than your hair shows how far you &apos;ve fallen .
oh , my god , i can &apos;t believe it .
max , it &apos;s the williamsburg cue @-@ pon queen .
where &apos;d she leave her crown , in the minivan ?
this is so exciting . i have to go pay my respects .
we don &apos;t have time for this .
just throw the cake mix into the cart
or we &apos;ll miss the train .
there , calm down , have a treat .
i &apos;ll be right back .
excuse me , your highness ,
but aren &apos;t you the cue @-@ pon queen ?
i &apos;m caroline .
freddie , and i can &apos;t talk right now
because if i lose my place--
you &apos;ll lose your mind !
i &apos;m gonna lose ... my ... mind ...
i know . you say that on your show .
i won &apos;t bother you , but i think you &apos;ll be excited
when i tell you that it &apos;s only my second day
and i already learned how to make money on the purchase of cake mix .
all i have to do is buy 40 boxes and we get the--
store bonus , yeah .
cake mix ... that &apos;s a rare cue @-@ pon .
where &apos;d you find it ?
yesterday &apos;s circulars .
didn &apos;t you see it ?
i missed it .
go to the truck and get the stockpile of circulars .
look at him go .
you &apos;re sweeping the shelves .
on your show , you said sweeping the shelves was out of line .
max !
these are mine , i was here first .
i think she &apos;s probably gonna be here last ,
so let &apos;s go , we don &apos;t need these .
we do , if we don &apos;t get 40 boxes ,
they won &apos;t be free .
i &apos;ve met actual queens and this isn &apos;t royal behavior .
max , she just body @-@ checked me .
push me again and i will report you to the american embassy .
max , get in here .
oh , we got a problem ?
oh , we got a problem .
oh , hell no !
what do we do ?
you step away and pretend you didn &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s what you do .
24 , 25--
you &apos;re making me wait , now aren &apos;t ya ?
just till i get to 40 .
26 , 27 , 28 .
come on , i &apos;ll buy it for you .
come on , take up the bitch on his offer
and let &apos;s go see chestnut .
max , shh , i &apos;m counting .
if we don &apos;t have the exact right mix @-@ to @-@ coupon ratio
we won &apos;t get our free money .
okay , where was i ?
amateur .
real mature , your highness .
we have places to go .
okay , 40 .
take it away , tanya .
wait , what is this ?
this isn &apos;t duncan hines , it &apos;s pillsbury .
where did this come from ?
i put it in .
you can &apos;t do that .
it has to be all duncan hines .
i needed pillsbury .
well , you can &apos;t have it .
i need it !
why ?
i need it !
why ?
that &apos;s the secret ingredient .
i throw a spoon of pillsbury
in the duncan hines .
pillsbury ?
that &apos;s what makes it you ?
that &apos;s what makes it more delicious .
tanya , stop , flag on the play .
here , take this back and get me another .
you know what , i &apos;m just gonna go see chestnut while i still have time .
no , max , please take this back and get me another one .
you &apos;re the one who wanted to use
the store @-@ bought mix instead of making your own from scratch .
so go back and get me another mix .
i used the mix because i don &apos;t know how to make my own .
no one ever taught me .
no one taught me how to bake .
no one taught me how to use tampons .
no one taught me anything .
you still think i should send my mom a better gift ?
and no one taught you how to check out , either .
i &apos;m going .
max .
you need to get another mix , now don &apos;t ya ?
i &apos;ll go get it , won &apos;t take a minute .
who &apos;s the queen now ?
hey , my dude .
look at you and your fancy coat .
retirement looks good on you .
told you i &apos;d come by to see you .
hooked you up with some carrots .
bugs bunny status , like i know you like .
i , uh , i don &apos;t know if you got my text .
probably not a great signal in here , but ...
your mom might be a little late .
she &apos;s coming though &apos; cause i know she &apos;s dying to see you .
all right , man , who am i kidding ?
she &apos;s not coming .
i know that &apos;s hard to hear ,
and trust me , mothers not showing up ,
i &apos;ve been there .
but , i know wherever she is ,
she is thinking of you .
okay , that &apos;s not true either .
here &apos;s the thing .
your mom is a flake .
and you got two options ,
you can sit around feeling sorry for yourself
or you can say , &quot; hey , my mom &apos;s not here .
&quot; i can watch tv all day
and then go kick in a neighbor &apos;s window because i feel like it . &quot;
hey .
hey , look at me .
the fact that she &apos;s not here is not your fault .
it &apos;s hers .
there , i just saved you , like ,
14 inappropriate sexual encounters .
hi , chestnut !
hi , baby .
i missed you .
i missed you so much .
did you miss me ?
so you got all the cake mix ?
yes , plus the $ 23 .
and i got you your pillsbury as well .
paid full price-- it killed me .
you are a freak with the coupons .
i know .
i don &apos;t know what came over me .
when i found a way to make free money
i forgot about everyone else .
oh , my god .
like my father .
max , i have ponzi dna .
yeah , cou @-@ ponzi dna .
must have been hard learning to do everything on your own .
i mean , i don &apos;t know how to do any of that stuff either ,
but , i had a staff of 20 .
yeah , i got staph at 20 .
you know , you may think your secret ingredient
is a spoonful of pillsbury ,
but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s you .
it &apos;s everything you &apos;ve been through
that makes you who you are .
someone who fights for a box of tampons
and fights for a horse &apos;s feelings
and even fights for a box of cake mix
when a friend in the middle of a cue @-@ ponzi panic , asks her to .
this is the part in the lifetime movie version
where i get up to pee .
i don &apos;t know who you &apos;re kidding .
you watch the entire movie and then you cry .
listen to her , chestnut .
she thinks she has me all figured out .
what she doesn &apos;t know is that when it comes to the cupcakes ,
i have another secret , secret ingredient .
oh , don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s a pinch of betty crocker .
i can &apos;t tell you . it &apos;s a secret ingredient .
okay , it &apos;s chocolate methamphetamine .
no , it &apos;s true .
our slogan should be :
they &apos;re so good ,
you &apos;ll rob your grandmother .
