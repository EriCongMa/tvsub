and she &apos;s just like ,
&quot; yeah , cool . i &apos;ll wear , like , men &apos;s shirts and , like , sneakers and stuff .
and , like , i don &apos;t care about how i look . &quot;
she has no idea about the party .

who does that ?
how do you even possibly do that ?
it &apos;s not a flammable thing .
it &apos;s not even ... are you a witch ?
mike ...
i hate all of you hipsters so much ...
okay , and i &apos;m gonna be on jess watch .
i &apos;m gonna make sure she doesn &apos;t see anything
that will ruin the surprise of this party
that has taken everything from me ,
emotionally and physically and financially .
so what do you have planned for the day ?
a big surprise party .
next .
right , but before then .
the party &apos;s at 7 : 00 . what do you have planned b @-@ before that ?
wait ...
nick , you need a plan , okay ?
i don &apos;t care what jess says . she &apos;s going to expect something .
i have to plan a birthday before the birthday ?
the whole day is the birthday .
this is a very big deal .
this is your first birthday together as a couple .
all right , you know what ? it &apos;s gonna be okay .
it &apos;s her birthday . that girl &apos;s gonna want to sleep in .
my day is not starting till noon .
this is the time i was born .
i &apos;m wide awake .
it &apos;s my birthday .
my day started earlier than i thought .
i got to slow down breakfast .
what &apos;s going on with you guys ?
nick , first of all , blessings .
um , second of all , there may have been
a possible mix @-@ up with the cake .
possibly .
&quot; see you in hell , boomer &quot; ? oh , my god !
what part of you thought this was jess &apos;s cake ?
i thought it was an inside joke .
i &apos;ll do the cake .
no , i am the cake patrol .
both of you do the cake .
i &apos;m considering this problem solved .
hey , speaking of problems , do you want me to go check up
on cece at the bar today ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s necessary .
all right , i &apos;ll do it . but you owe me one , bro .
i need to make a 90 @-@ minute omelet .
i love my birthday breakfast .
i can &apos;t believe you were gonna make this all yourself .
it would &apos;ve taken you hours .
i know . and with your help , it took six minutes .
i know . i &apos;m so fast .
what do you say we go into my bedroom
and , uh , slow things down ?
that &apos;s the fastest it &apos;s ever taken .
i know . you just look very pretty .
so , you want to take a long nap ?
if that &apos;s what you have planned , then , yes ,
let &apos;s take a long nap .
perfect . maybe for , like , six , seven hours ?
it &apos;s just such a nice day outside ...
yeah . um , so let &apos;s take , uh ...
let &apos;s take this party outside .
sure .
next up on the agenda is ...
it &apos;s lunch .
it &apos;s 8 : 30 in the morning .
oh , my god , it &apos;s so early .
what are you doing here , schmidt ?
nick thought you might need some help .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t , okay ?
so ... you can go .
maybe i &apos;ll just stay for a little bit .
double @-@ tap some insta @-@ g &apos;s .
okay .
oh , hey , mike .
i cleaned the glasses .
oh , wow , a bunch of broken glass in the ice tub .
that &apos;ll be fun for me to clean up .
i &apos;m sorry . um ...
i &apos;m not gonna cover for you like nick does , okay ?
i promise you that . and don &apos;t make eyes at me
because it &apos;s not gonna work because i &apos;m super gay .
when i look at you , i just see ...
you know , it &apos;s fine ,
but it &apos;s bumpy , it &apos;s creepy .
doesn &apos;t do anything . it &apos;s like ...
looking at this , it &apos;s like a ...
it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s ... it &apos;s not o ...
it &apos;s not a good ... it &apos;s not good .
okay .

three out of ... six .
damn shame about that cake , winston .
looks like someone dominated their party task .
&quot; coach , where are all the kazoos ? &quot;
all over your face .
i &apos;ll pick those up .
or maybe in my spare time ...
i &apos;ll make a cake .
just back off , coach .
what &apos;s up , nick ?
how &apos;s the cake situation ?
cake &apos;s good .
can i just see the phone ?
can i see the phone really quick ? got it .
hey . cake &apos;s good , man . i &apos;m on top of it .
so , how &apos;s your plan working out ?
okay , i have no plan . i &apos;m just winging it , okay ?
i panicked and took her to a drugstore .
she &apos;s getting a free diabetes test .
i don &apos;t know where to take her . is it safe to bring her home ?
hey . oh ! the birthday girl !
i got the test . my blood sugar is normal .
already ? you did that ... all that already ?
yeah .
birthday girl gets ... all your favorite ...
next activity .
i see what you &apos;re trying to do here , man .
you &apos;re trying to show me up .
what are you talking about , bish ?
i &apos;m referring to basketball .
when we used to play back in the day , no matter how open i was ,
you never passed me the ball , you never let me shoot .
you just couldn &apos;t stand to let me shine .
your nostrils are flaring so much right now ,
it &apos;s distracting .
i &apos;m done letting you run the court .
i &apos;m building my own court .
and it &apos;s gonna be bigger and yummier than yours .
are you challenging me to a bake @-@ off , bish ?
yes , i am challenging you to a bake @-@ off .
okay . well , then , i &apos;ll ... do the countdown .
you know what ? i &apos;ll do the countdown then .
the countdown begins
when this timer goes off .
you set the timer for 20 minutes .
i &apos;m gonna make a cake so moist ,
girls are gonna be , like , &quot; ew . why do you say moist ?
i hate that word . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna be , like , &quot; just taste the cake . &quot;
and they &apos;re gonna be , like , &quot; damn , it &apos;s moist ! &quot;
and ...
bake !
okay , bake !
i said it first . i said it first .
i said it first . i said it first .
a customer ordered an old @-@ fashioned ,
and she got gin in a mug with a peanut in it .
i &apos;ll fix it .
make me an old @-@ fashioned right now ,
or i &apos;m gonna call the manager .
and i want to talk to him anyway ,
because he &apos;s just gorgeous .
i want to be a barnacle on his ship .
just hanging on by my mouth ,
getting all the nutrients i need .
okay , an old @-@ fashioned , an old @-@ fashioned , an old @-@ fashioned .
if it &apos;s old @-@ fashioned , it probably has something like ...
absinthe ...
oh , the old @-@ fashioned .
one of my favorite drinks ; a classic cocktail .
just a half ounce of simple syrup .
splash of water , two dashes of bitters .
mix that up with some ice .
and then , you know my personal favorite .
you know , and just , far be it from me ,
but the bourbon whiskey .
bourbon . two ounces of bourbon whiskey .
no . hmm .
it &apos;s not the scotch whiskey . it &apos;s ...
no , it &apos;s certainly not the vermouth .
vermouth would be insane .
yes , the bourbon whiskey .
my favorite . wonderful .
look at that . old @-@ fashioned .
hmm . old @-@ fashioned ?
oh , my stars and garters , you made a drink .
holy crud .

it &apos;s not that i &apos;m not having fun , &apos; cause i am .
it &apos;s okay if you didn &apos;t plan anything for my birthday .
are you kidding ? !
really , nick .
not only did i plan something ,
but my plan &apos;s about to blow your mind .

eggs and sex and ...
and a really long uphill walk .
and , um ... look , um ,
that &apos;s amazing for you , you know ?
for me ?
you &apos;re not a guy who plans things .
maybe i am .
look ... every day , you show me , in your own way ,
how you care about me .
like when you pick up rubber bands on the sidewalk .
for your ponytail .
i could not be more fine .
i &apos;m super chill .
i &apos;m just gonna go home for a second .
bye .
jess , let &apos;s keep ... jess !

cece , look , i got ... i got it .
ooh , there &apos;s a knob back here .
i got it in .
he told me if i turn this ,
i should be able to ...

i &apos;m so sorry .

a lot of people never graduated high school .
okay-- einstein , bill gates ,
anne frank .
i &apos;m gonna take back that last one .
why did i think that i could bartend ?
because you can .
you are strong , and you are confident .
those are skills . use them .
and be a little bit meaner to the people here .
it should be easy for you . just pretend that they &apos;re me .
you &apos;re right . that is easy .
and pull your shirt down a little bit .
this isn &apos;t a monastery .
do not push your luck with me .
i &apos;ll look away .

she doesn &apos;t think i can do anything or plan anything ,
and it feels like crap .
maybe she &apos;s right .
why did i think i could pull this off ?
i &apos;m pretty sure i &apos;m having a heart attack .
and i haven &apos;t arranged for anybody to clear my internet history .
i wasn &apos;t building a bomb !
i was just curious .
nick , you got a whole team of friends pulling for you , okay ?
just get yourself home . you can still pull this off .
hey , mike .

so i cleaned out the beer trap ,
i polished all these wine glasses ,
and i turned that penis graffiti in the bathroom
into a whimsical hat .

i put one under every seat ,
but you got to go fast , &apos; cause of the timing .

in the beginning , there was nothing ,
and then there was light and dark
and oceans and birds and stuff ...
and then there was jess !
nick ? this was the plan all along ?
what do i think of when i think of jess ?
when i think of jess . okay ...
when i think about jess ...
