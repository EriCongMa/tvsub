we &apos;re going to replacers ... garrett &apos;s note
with a fake note that we wrote .
you sure this is it ?
she never took it off .
told them i got an anonymous tip .
they seemed to believe me .
the anklet had trace amounts of blood still on it--
alison &apos;s and someone else &apos;s .
if only i could remember what happened that night ,
this would all be over .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s that simple , em .
i met jenna here yesterday afternoon .
i wanna know more .
no , you don &apos;t .
&quot; hot mama loves tango &quot; ?
i &apos;m going to kill aria .
i can explain that .
hey there , ashley .
pastor .
detective wilden , right ?
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s ted .
you &apos;re getting them again , aren &apos;t you ? the texts .
what texts are you talking about ?
just be an act to keep her out of jail .
she can &apos;t hurt us anymore , okay ?
bitch crazy .
no , mom , you don &apos;t have to go over the rules with me again .
no one is hanging out in my room except for me .
no , caleb &apos;s not coming over . he lost my number .
can we change the subject ?
yes , mom .
hey , i &apos;m up , i &apos;m dressed , and i &apos;m fed .
all right , enjoy your conference . love you .
morning , hanna . is your mom home ?
why ?
cause i &apos;m not supposed to talk to you without a guardian present .
like that &apos;s stopped you before .
do me a favor tell your mom we need you to come in for a blood sample .
why do you need my blood ?
we have new evidence in the dilaurentis case ,
and the family wants answers .
and since the blood on that anklet
doesn &apos;t match the guy who &apos;s locked up .
what , so you think it &apos;s my blood ?
o @-@ negative , same type as yours .
yeah , and probably a billion other people .
the billion other people weren &apos;t
slipping notes under a woman &apos;s hospital bracelet .
you have no proof that i did that .
multiple witnesses saw you coming out of that room , hanna .
well , they &apos;re wrong .
my blood is not on your evidence .
then why do you look so scared ?
that &apos;s why &quot; a &quot; wants garrett out of jail ,
so i can take his place .
okay , don &apos;t go there .
it &apos;s already past there , emily .
he knows about the note , he caught me at church ,
and it &apos;s my blood type .
so what ? you didn &apos;t kill anybody .
wilden said that ali &apos;s family &apos;s been slamming him .
have you talked to jason ?
no , i can &apos;t even look him in the eye ,
but i &apos;m gonna talk to him today .
han , don &apos;t worry ,
there &apos;s nothing they can do until your mom gets back tomorrow .
so what ? i have 48 hours of freedom ?
maybe spencer &apos;s mom can block the court order .
you guys , what if it is my blood ?
how ?
seriously , how could somebody take your blood
and you wouldn &apos;t even know it ?
emily has a whole night that she doesn &apos;t remember .
han , wait , you need to--
i can &apos;t talk about this anymore .
i have to go to school .
maybe one of us should call her mom .
i don &apos;t think her mom will follow with wilden .
this isn &apos;t shoplifting .
take it from me ,
you &apos;re always better off with a really good buy .
is it just me ,
or did that sound a lot like ...
alison .
something wrong ?
oh , no . sorry .
wow , you just sound a lot like one of our friends .
hope she &apos;s brilliant .
what &apos;s her name ?
alison dilaurentis .
you were friends of ali &apos;s .
me too . i &apos;m cece .
spencer .
melissa hasting &apos;s little sister .
ali talked about you .
she talked about all of you .
a lot .
how do you know ali ?
before i moved to l.a. ,
our families rented summer homes in cape may .
we went through an intense couple weeks together .
i dated her brother , jason .
she never mentioned me to you guys ?
no .
well , it was intense for me .
she was going through such a rough time ,
like a broken doll .
so why did you move back to rosewood ?
listen , i hate to make tracks , but i &apos;m already late ,
and my boss is high @-@ strung and aggressively sober .
come and me at the new boutique across the street .
oh , and if you ever feel like doing a little free shopping ,
i &apos;ll be happy to turn the other way .
i @-@ i think you &apos;re thinking of hanna .
she &apos;s not here .
okay , that &apos;s not just me , right ?
i mean , that chick is freakishly like ali .
or was ali freakishly like her ?
i mean , one hip out , the head tilt .
looking straight through you ,
like she knew all your secrets .
aria , hey . what &apos;s ... that ?
bills .
you forgot to tell vanity fair that you moved .
more importantly , what is that ?
uh ... nothing . impulse buy .
i ... kind of have a date tonight .
excuse me ?
you heard me .
i met somebody , on that website that you made me join .
oh , that &apos;s awesome !
well , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
because if i mention it beforehand ,
i may be more nervous than i already am .
you do not need to be nervous .
that is easy for you to say .
you have dated within this century .
so , who is he , where does he live ,
and what is the hair situation ?
plenty , and it &apos;s on his head .
excellent . nice eyes ?
yes . kind of smiley.think ,
i don &apos;t know , like silver fox .
ooh , nice .
that &apos;s-- that &apos;s what you &apos;re wearing ?
well , i thought it was .
is it too much for a coffee shop ?
wait , why am i asking you ?
you wear forks as earrings .
no , no , no , i like it .
i do , and it &apos;s pretty daring for you .
and please , do not wear a scarf with it .
what makes you say i would wear a scarf ?
because i have known you 100 % of my life .
bye .
toby .
what are you doing here ?
i didn &apos;t feel like leaving another message .
why are you avoiding me ?
i &apos;m not .
i know there wasn &apos;t anyone hounding hanna at that church dance .
why did you lie ?
i was with jason .
why is that a secret ?
okay , you know that anklet that was turned in to the police ?
well , he didn &apos;t find that on his own .
so , what ? you needed something to keep me busy for the night ?
look , he got a tip ,
and jason wants to prove garrett guilty .
yeah , but he ended up doing the opposite .
well , i &apos;m not giving up .
i don &apos;t think that that anklet proves anything .
he is guilty .
and you &apos;re sure of this ?
why are you challenging me ?
because there was a time when you thought i murdered alison .
remember ?
evidence can get distorted , taken out of context .
it &apos;s made me a lot slower to pass judgment .
better get to class .
how &apos;s my favorite barista ?
busy , but they did take me off of cappuccino probation , so ...
that &apos;s a thing ?
it is here . what &apos;s up ?
what do you think ?
got it for jenna .
i knew it . i suck at buying gifts .
they all smelled like hairspray ,
so i got the one with the nicest name .
why are you buying her anything ?
didn &apos;t bring a gift to her party ,
and we have a date .
like , a date @-@ date .
and i need you to help me shop .
the candle &apos;s great . jenna will love it .
she has a highly developed sense of smell .
come on , emily . i need your help .
you guys are good friends .
we are ? who told you that ?
jenna .
she had some nice things to say about maya too .
she didn &apos;t even know maya .
not according to her .
maya drove her home from school a couple of times .
look , i &apos;ll let you get back to work ,
but , um , call me on your break .
i mean , don &apos;t you just find it a little bizarre
that she never even mentioned her before ?
hey , can you cheat on a blood test ?
okay , stop . that &apos;s not gonna happen .
what is that ?
don &apos;t touch it !
you okay ?
see how it easy it is for me to get your blood ?
&quot; a &quot; was in here ?
hanna , what &apos;s going on ?
this doesn &apos;t look forced .
do you think &quot; a &quot; has a key ?
what is this thing ?
i don &apos;t know . we have to go check upstairs .
slow down !
what is this thing ? does it mean something ?
i don &apos;t know what it means , aria .
well , then , why is it on your kitchen counter ?
we have to go .
okay , hanna , stop , okay ?
talk to me . what is this ?
do you remember that earring &quot; a &quot; sent you ?
you buried this with ali ?
just the hand thing .
why ?
mona and i played it before they found ali &apos;s body .
seriously ?
i know . i didn &apos;t believe in it either ,
but this summer , me and my cousin contacted a ghost
who knew all kinds of impossible stuff .
it was way freaky .
i mean , if you &apos;re too scared ...
spirits , can you hear us ?
okay , you did that .
no , i didn &apos;t .
okay , what do you want to ask it ?
i don &apos;t know . does sean still have his &quot; v &quot; card ?
like we need the spirit world to tell us that ?
let &apos;s ask if alison &apos;s coming back .
mona , don &apos;t .
why ? you know you want the answer .
no , i &apos;m not playing this .
oh , deep down ... you still think she &apos;s alive .
i don &apos;t want to talk about--
just put your fingers down , for god &apos;s sake .
i will ask the questions .
spirits , do you know what happened to
alison dilaurentis ?
okay , you did that .
no , i didn &apos;t .
&quot; a. &quot;
&quot; l. &quot;
&quot; i. &quot;
alison ?
&quot; v. &quot;
&quot; e. &quot;
alive ?
mona was already &quot; a &quot; by then .
she probably hired somebody to stand outside and scare you .
yeah , well , it worked .
wait . did anyone besides mona know that story ?
this could prove that she &apos;s in contact with &quot; a. &quot;
how else would they know that this keepsake was yours ?
there &apos;s no way to find out who else mona told .
she &apos;s not allowed visitors .
i &apos;m at the top of the not @-@ allowed list .
then i &apos;ll go .
i don &apos;t care if i have to scale the walls ,
i am talking to her today .
i &apos;m sleeping at your house tonight .
yep .
jason .
what &apos;s up ?
i , uh , heard you were going to be on the basketball courts .
yeah , i was . pulled myself out of the game .
why ?
figured i &apos;d hurt less people running around the block .
right . well , that answers my next question .
which was ?
are you okay ?
i &apos;m so sorry that i dragged you into this .
it &apos;s not your fault , spencer .
you didn &apos;t make me walk into that police station .
i know , but i thought that--
i know . that this piece of jewelry would have ended this .
but it didn &apos;t , all right ?
now , instead of being the big hero ,
i &apos;m back to being the big screw @-@ up .
nobody thinks that .
really ?
maybe i should let you pick up my father from the airport .
do your parents think that garrett is still guilty ,
or do they think that now it &apos;s somebody else ?
i don &apos;t know what they think .
never have .
well , what do you think ?
i think that i &apos;m done looking for answers around here ,
that &apos;s what i think .
i &apos;m not a detective , and i &apos;m not a lawyer .
hey , i , uh , i met cece drake this morning .
did you know that she &apos;s back in town ?
i heard .
i didn &apos;t even know that she and ali were friends .
she said that you guys spent an intense summer .
everything with cece &apos;s intense .
did it end on a bad note ?
you could say that .
look , i got to , uh , get home and take a shower .
i &apos;m gonna be late for his plane .
okay .
these are everywhere in l.a. right now .
rachel zoe practically gives them out as business cards .
pretty .
next .
no , that &apos;s good .
you &apos;re a lousy liar .
listen , handsome ,
we just got in some killer vera scarves .
why don &apos;t you go pick out a couple in your price range ,
and we &apos;ll pick the best .
what &apos;s her name ?
it &apos;s obvious whoever he &apos;s buying this gift for , you don &apos;t like .
jenna .
and she got to him before you did ?
try again .
you like him , right ?
we &apos;re just friends .
and if you don &apos;t want to tap that , you &apos;re either blind or ...
ohh .
you &apos;re the one .
the one what ?
with the giant crush on ali .
she told you that ?
if you don &apos;t like him , then why do you care if he &apos;s with jenna ?
is she a bitch or something ?
she &apos;s ... something .
then you should tell him .
you &apos;d be doing him a favor .
emily , could you come here for a second ?
would you wear this ?
no .
but i &apos;m not jenna .
oh . what about these ?
maya had something like this .
yeah , she did .
i got these a week before ...
how do you know she had these ?
i don &apos;t know .
must have been in a picture she sent or something .
what about this ?
how much are you wanting to spend ? you just met her .
would you quit busting my chops ?
i wouldn &apos;t even be buying her this gift
if the hottest girl in rosewood was available ,
or interested in guys .
you totally picked my favorite .
can i get you something ?
uh , no . i &apos;m supposed to meet somebody here .
you want something while you wait ?
these just came out of the oven .
i can tell .
i should have skipped the perfume
and just worn one of those . what are they ?
these are vanilla custard and those are just butter .
nothing is just butter .
i &apos;ll take a decaf , please .
is emily here ?
uh , not at the moment , no .
everyone abandoned me .
i &apos;m not usually out here .
emily &apos;s a sweet girl . how do you know her ?
she &apos;s my daughter &apos;s best friend .
oh , cool . okay . yeah , she &apos;ll be back soon .
that &apos;s too bad .
i was hoping not to have a first date in front of her .
ah . ooh , yeah . those are never fun .
it &apos;s basically a job interview , without the forms .
there were forms .
well , with any luck ,
he &apos;s not out of prison just for the night .
thank you , &apos; cause i wasn &apos;t really nervous before .
ella ?
hi . ted .
hello .
oh , you ordered already .
yeah , just a coffee .
i passed that ice cream cart .
the day &apos;s so nice , i thought ...
oh ! yeah .
um , i just wanted a sip .
just settle down .
i got you , nicky . come on .
can i help you ?
yeah , um , i &apos;m here to see someone .
mona vanderwaal ?
well , let &apos;s see .
her status has changed ,
but i will need you to leave your purse , your cellphone ,
any lighters or matches you have ...
oh , and those earrings .
your earrings .
thank you .
mona .
you have a visitor .
hello , aria .
we need to talk .
her visits need to be supervised ,
but you won &apos;t even know i &apos;m here .
so ...
would you like to play a game ?
what did your mom say ?
that you can &apos;t block a court order in an afternoon .
she needs time .
but she &apos;ll do it ?
she &apos;s gonna try .
try ? !
it &apos;s my mom . with her , a try ...
is as good as a win .
just calm down .
did aria get in to see mona ?
i haven &apos;t heard anything yet .
when did alison &apos;s father get back to rosewood ?
today .
do you want me to talk to him ?
no .
well , maybe you should , han .
you &apos;re believing everything that wilden says .
why don &apos;t you find out for yourself ?
&apos;cause i can &apos;t .
and you know what ? you &apos;re right .
your mom &apos;s on it , so there &apos;s no reason for me to panic .
there are things you need to know ...
about jenna .
okay .
before you got here , before a lot of things ,
jenna dated garrett .
garrett reynolds .
i wanted to tell you , but i wasn &apos;t sure how .
you seem so happy .
no , you did the right thing .
i really appreciate it .
wow .
yeah .
i mean , she could have been his next victim .
that &apos;s not exactly what i meant .
you don &apos;t have to worry .
jenna brings up garrett ,
i won &apos;t let on that you told me .
but i &apos;m glad you did .
you &apos;re a good friend .
i was there , so they asked me to officiate .
mm . sounds beautiful .
it was .
and soggy .
if you &apos;re ever in phuket in september ,
bring an umbrella .
what ? what &apos;s wrong ?
too much church talk , right ?
no , no , not at all . i &apos;m-- i &apos;m impressed .
i mean , i &apos;ve never met a pastor
a pastor who heard the call
while boogie @-@ boarding in samoa .
this is really good , huh ?
mr. dilaurentis .
hanna .
i thought about writing you a letter and ...
i &apos;ve gone over what to say in head the past year ,
i just wanted to say that i &apos;m sorry
for what i did .
you and your family were going through so much ,
and i didn &apos;t help .
but i swear to you ,
i had nothing to do with what &apos;s happening now .
i didn &apos;t touch her grave , and i would never .
i mean , believe me , no one wants to see ali be at peace--
don &apos;t you--
a friend would never do what you did .
at the time , it felt like a childish prank .
seems like you &apos;ve gotten crueler with age .
you need a good foundation .
start with a good foundation ,
and you can build anything .
i &apos;m sorry i came alone , but hanna couldn &apos;t make it .
lisa , isn &apos;t it time for my medicine ?
you have about 25 seconds to tell me why you &apos;re really here .
twenty @-@ four , twenty @-@ three ...
what hanna buried with ali--
the planchette-- showed up on her kitchen counter today .
are you sure it was-- ?
yes .
how ?
it &apos;s not the only thing we &apos;ve gotten back from ali &apos;s grave .
look , i know that you don &apos;t like me .
trust me , the feeling is mutual .
but think about hanna .
she &apos;s the reason you did everything you did , right ?
she truly believed that at one time your friendship was real .
our friendship was real .
okay , then if you care about her-- if you ever did--
please , mona ,
please tell me who &apos;s trying to hurt her .
she &apos;s in trouble , and i swear to you--
i swear if you &apos;re behind this--
it isn &apos;t me .
here we go . visiting hours are over .
tell hanna i &apos;m sorry .
you didn &apos;t have to come all the way down here .
what &apos;d she say ?
hardly anything . her visits are supervised now ,
but she wanted me to tell you that she &apos;s sorry .
is it possible that maybe she &apos;s not behind any of this ?
either way , she knows who is .
hey . visiting hours are over .
the nurses change shifts in twenty minutes .
what ? i &apos;ve been here enough times to know .
that &apos;s not what the look is for . you &apos;re sneaking in .
hanna ...
i know that you &apos;re freaked out about everything ,
but you could just come back tomorrow .
and do what ?
have a nice chat about &quot; a &quot; in the day room ?
okay , then i &apos;m going with you .
no ! aria , this--
hanna , friends don &apos;t let friends
sneak into insane asylums alone .
hey .
hey .
so you deliver now ?
oh , no , this is for me .
americano , straight .
well , the coffee , at least .
so , did you talk to handsome ?
his name &apos;s nate .
that &apos;s not an answer .
yes , i did , but i don &apos;t think it worked .
in fact , i think he ended up liking jenna more .
well , at least you tried .
that reminds me , i should give you my number .
yeah .
so , uh , do you see ali &apos;s big brother around much ?
he &apos;s around .
is he single ?
yeah .
how long did you-- ?
hi , is this jenna ?
the better question is , who the hell are you ,
and why are you going out with my boyfriend ?
oh , you didn &apos;t ? &apos; cause i think that you did know ,
and just didn &apos;t care .
please stop .
here &apos;s what i know :
if i ever see you anywhere near nate ,
i will scratch your eyes out .
what are you doing ?
she used to be blind .
well , it needed to be done .
it &apos;s not like we shot a unicorn--
we &apos;re helping your friend out .
i know , but ...
do you want me to call her back ,
tell her that i was kidding ?
that &apos;s what i thought .
problem solved .
see you around , americano .
hey , you &apos;re back !
uh , yeah , actually this time i am looking for emily .
i was trying to get in touch with my daughter ,
and thought emily might know where she is .
just missed her . how &apos;d the date go ?
uh ... it was fine .
but there &apos;s not gonna be another one .
we &apos;ll see .
well ... tell you what ,
just so the night ends on a sweet note .
here .
we can &apos;t sell day @-@ old pastry .
you can &apos;t sell pastries to people my age at all .
what &apos;s wrong with your age ?
thank you . um ... and i will take these to go .
your choice . you can stay , if you want .
mmm ... aren &apos;t you closing ?
well , we close when i want to close .
ownership has its privileges .
you own this place ?
i &apos;m zack .
apron fooled you , huh ?
wait out here , all right ?
make sure no one comes .
hanna ?
what are you doing here ? is everything okay ?
well , i &apos;m being set up for killing a friend , mona .
what do you think ?
god , you poor thing !
you know what ? save it , mona .
alison &apos;s dad &apos;s back .
yeah . and you &apos;re the only person who knows
why he &apos;s never forgiven me .
who else knows about the night i saw alison ?
nurse was coming .
what she doing back here ?
she never left .
you need to give her some answers , so talk .
can i ?
does she know about that day ?
know about what ?
cut it out , all right ?
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
is he really still mad at you ?
who ? what-- hanna , what the hell is she talking about ?
i won &apos;t say anything if you don &apos;t want me to .
say something about what ?
it &apos;s really simple : you just take
the first letter of each word to spell out a new word .
so , like , &quot; she lives under trees &quot; equals &quot; slut . &quot;
what ?
it &apos;s a code ...
so we can talk about people right in front of them .
look , i &apos;m sorry , mona ,
i &apos;m just really not in the mood right now .
i know , but i thought it
might help you take your mind off things .
do you have any idea ?
dad , don &apos;t !
do you know what your little joke ...
did to my wife ? she believed you !
you gave her hope !
stay away from my family !
dad , dad , come on , let &apos;s go .
how could you ?
the night that i saw alison on my patio ,
i called mrs.dilaurentis and
i told her she was alive .
then , three days later , they found her body .
look , he still hates me .
i could just feel it . he &apos;s never forgiven me .
another stupid mistake &quot; a &quot; can use to ruin my life .
where the hell is mona ?
please tell me you still have your keys .
jason .
jason .
jason !
jason .
hey , are you okay ?
jason , are you drunk ?
stop it . the police are gonna be here any minute , okay ?
maybe they &apos;ll lock me up with garrett .
finally get some justice .
just move over .
what ?
i said move over !
why ?
because this never happened .
come on .
oh , i &apos;m going to twist mona &apos;s head off .
i know , but first we have to find her .
you don &apos;t think she &apos;s still &quot; a , &quot; do you ?
that-- that door , it &apos;s always closed .
children &apos;s ward . dedicated 1931 .
do you think she went in there ?
those are mine .
you gave tweezers to a mental patient ?
of course not !
she probably stole them .
come on .
hey .
hey .
what-- what took you so long ?
can you give me a ride to my car ?
it &apos;s not here ?
no , we need to hurry , please .
what ? what &apos;s going on ?
i @-@ i had to give jason a ride .
you &apos;re chasing down another tip .
no , it &apos;s not like that .
well , then tell me what is like ...
because you &apos;re not being ...
spencer , what &apos;s happening ?
so you are home .
what are you doing here ?
we found your vehicle near the scene of an accident .
your door was wide open .
well , i &apos;m fine ,
if that &apos;s what you mean .
but you didn &apos;t report your car stolen .
we &apos;ve been here all night , detective .
i picked her up after work today .
how many times do i have to tell you
to lock your doors , spence ?
it &apos;s not the 1950s .
yeah . he &apos;s right .
it &apos;s such a terrible habit .
we &apos;ll talk later .
spencer , what was that about ?
i told you , i needed to give jason a ride .
and you just happened to
leave your car at the scene of a hit @-@ and @-@ run ?
i just lied to the police .
there was an accident , that &apos;s all .
accidents don &apos;t need to be kept from the cops .
jason was drunk , okay ?
spencer , i felt like i was finally done with the police .
that lie ... it &apos;s a felony .
i understand that , okay ? and i &apos;m sorry .
but if jason gets caught , he could lose everything .
you can &apos;t tell anybody . please promise me .
do you hear that ?
they used to put kids down here ?
wait , over there .
what is she doing ?
miss aria , you &apos;re a killer , not ezra &apos;s wife .
miss aria , you &apos;re a killer , not ezra &apos;s wife .
cut it out , mona .
where were we ?
maya &apos;s away , sleeping sweet .
until garrett &apos;s all rosy , count on me .
where were we ?
mona ?
somebody &apos;s coming .
look , mona , i am begging you ,
if you know anything about what &apos;s happening to us ,
can you just tell me , please ?
no one to save ali from evil .
no one to save ali from evil .
mona , is that you ?
hanna , we have to get out of here now .
mona ? there you are .
it &apos;s time to go now , honey .
no .
come .
i missed my dolls .
they &apos;re not going anywhere . come now .
where were we ?
maya &apos;s away , sleeping sweet .
until garrett &apos;s all rosy , count on me .
where were we ?
did you get my message ? where were you ?
uh , i had to help hanna with something .
where are you ?
at the brew .
you &apos;re still on your date ?
no , not that one , but , um ...
i think i may be on a second one .
hold on . what happened to the first one ?
it ended .
i mean , it was nice , but ...
he ate ice cream like your father .
he scraped the sides
and left a big mound in the middle ?
yes !
mom ! come on , that &apos;s not a reason to end a date .
i know , it &apos;s not . you &apos;re right .
and he &apos;s perfectly lovely ,
and i can totally see why the website linked us up .
okay , what &apos;s the problem , then ?
problem is , there is no problem .
he &apos;s the right choice .
he &apos;s the choice i would have made at 19,
but i think i ... maybe should be open to more ...
possibilities .
i don &apos;t believe this .
mom , two dates in one night ?
yeah , you are definitely wearing a scarf next time .
i &apos;m done with scarves .
do you want them ?
mom , can we just--
can we talk about this tomorrow ? i &apos;m exhausted .
god ! you used to be so much more fun .
and then i grew up . go to bed , mom .
what &apos;s up with your mom ?
she &apos;s a slut . let &apos;s just go to sleep .
where were we ?
maya &apos;s away , sleeping sweet .
until garrett &apos;s all rosy , count on me .
a code ?
it &apos;s a stupid thing she made up
back when we were friends .
why wouldn &apos;t she just come out and say it ?
because aria was there .
she doesn &apos;t trust her .
so it &apos;s my fault ?
you gave the girl a pair of tweezers .
look , mona pushed me to remember that day with ali &apos;s dad
because that &apos;s when she gave me the code .
okay , i have a french exam at eight a.m.
could we just skip ahead to the actual message ?
&quot; no one to save ali from evil . &quot;
that &apos;s what she kept saying .
if you take the first letter of each word , you get ...
&quot; not safe . &quot;
it &apos;s not , like , that complicated .
yeah , but there &apos;s more .
oh , my god , what &apos;s that other poem ?
something about garrett and maya .
&quot; where were we ?
maya &apos;s away , sleeping sweet . &quot;
she gave you a website .
what was the rest ?
&quot; until garrett &apos;s all rosy , count on me . &quot;
&quot; mas sugar &quot; ? what does that mean ?
m @-@ a @-@ s , that &apos;s maya &apos;s initials .
anne was her middle name .
i don &apos;t suppose crazy slipped you the password as well ?
did mona mean she &apos;s not safe ,
or we &apos;re not ?
somebody &apos;s coming .
look , mona , i am begging you .
if you know anything about what &apos;s happening to us ,
can you just tell me , please ?
no one to save ali from evil .
no one to save ali from evil .
