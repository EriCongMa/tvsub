where the hell are we ?
1994 .
to get home , we &apos;ll harness the power of the ascendant .
what about bonnie ?
she sacrificed herself so i can come back .
she &apos;s all alone .
we miss you , bonnie .
i miss you guys .
i &apos;m sorry i compelled away the memories .
we &apos;ll make new ones .
i need you to promise me something .
when i &apos;m gone , caroline is gonna need you ,
to help her move on with her life .
promise me that you will do that , stefan .
i promise .
in our coven &apos;s tradition ,
the twins merge their strength .
the weaker one dies .
i know i &apos;m stronger than liv ,
so that means i will win if we merge .
one twin will absorb traits from the other .
both of your souls will unite into a new being .
desimilus ...
luke , don &apos;t !
sanguinem generis finatus .
luke is gone .
he merged with kai . kai won .
you win some , you lose some except for me .
i always win .
再接再厉吧
happy birthday , bonnie .
you want to--ugh-- give me a hand , please ?
little busy here .
ok . fine . then you are on decoration duty .
it &apos;s bonnie &apos;s birthday .
i know what today is .
then you know how she would have wanted us to spend it .
she would have wanted us to celebrate by
cooking her favorite foods ,
watching her favorite movies .
so we &apos;re throwing a birthday party
where the guest of honor never shows up .
that &apos;s not depressing .
or we could celebrate you going to art school .
oh , wait . we can &apos;t
because i found your application in the garbage .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that you were thinking
about going to art school ?
i &apos;m not . the only class i &apos;m passing is study hall .
they &apos;ll never let me in .
jer , i &apos;ve seen your portfolio .
you &apos;re good .
doesn &apos;t matter .
i &apos;m not leaving without knowing if bonnie &apos;s ok or not .
mom , i &apos;m not calling to check up on you , ok ?
i &apos;m just about to start making bonnie &apos;s birthday cake
and want to make sure that your recipe called
for 3 eggs instead of 4 , right ?
all right . i &apos;m just a phone call away in case you need any--
bye .
is it just me , or do her eyes follow you around the room ?
it &apos;s definitely you .
i haven &apos;t seen miss cuddles in 12 years .
well , that &apos;s the bear bonnie sent back from 1994 .
i guess she lost the original .
no . she didn &apos;t lose her .
i took her .
yeah . when bonnie and i were little ,
we got in this huge fight ,
so to get back at her , i bearnapped miss cuddles ,
and then i didn &apos;t want my mom to come home and find out ,
so then i buried her in the woods .
i even left some m &amp; m &apos;s to mark the spot where i left her ,
but something must have eaten them .
well , i &apos;m pretty sure that bonnie is over it by now .
miss cuddles isn &apos;t .
she &apos;s out there all alone like bonnie .
you know what ?
i &apos;m gonna go find her .
you &apos;re gonna what ?
yeah . it &apos;s bonnie &apos;s birthday .
wait , wait . hold on . caroline , you &apos;ve been going through a lot lately .
do you think that maybe you &apos;re just a little confused
about what you &apos;re actually upset about ?
yes , probably , but my mom &apos;s dying ,
and my best friend is stuck in an alternate universe ,
and her bear is in a hole in the woods ,
and there &apos;s only one of those things that i can do anything about .
right .
happy birthday , bon @-@ bon .
you think we could sneak one before the party ?
i think caroline might fry us in the sun .
it &apos;s worth the risk .
come here .
you know , we never talked about
the fact that you kissed me .
and you kissed me back ?
yeah .
i know .
that &apos;s the whole point of kissing so you don &apos;t have to talk about it .
right . well , i just wanted you to know
that i &apos;m good with that .
yeah ?
yeah . we--we &apos;re good .
really good .
was this the talk ?
pretty much .
perfect .
hello ?
no . that &apos;s impossible because why would he--
he didn &apos;t . he &apos;s all merged ,
he &apos;s packed , and his on his way to portland !
ooh ! forgot how massive this house was .
yum ! cupcakes !
sorry . am i interrupting something ?
what are you doing here ?
funniest thing .
i need your help .
why would we give a letter to jo ?
i haven &apos;t been able to find her using a locator spell ,
and , you know , good on her
because under normal circumstances ,
i &apos;d superjazzed to gouge out her belly button .
why would we help you , kai ?
well , in case you haven &apos;t figured it out by now ,
i &apos;m a sociopath .
i know . shocker .
i like being a sociopath .
you know , i &apos;m not burdened by things like guilt
or love .
so then this merge happened with my brother luke ,
and i won , which was great
because i absorbed his ability to do magic ,
but now i can &apos;t stop thinking about how luke died ,
how liv &apos;s life is ruined .
for some horrible reason , i can &apos;t shake
how badly i feel about it .
you feel bad ?
yeah . so when i absorbed luke &apos;s magic ,
i must have gotten some of his qualities or something
like empathy .
so i googled how to process emotional pain ,
and they said if you write everything down in a letter
and burn it , you &apos;ll be healed .
so i started writing ,
and this water literally started pooling in my eyes .
has that ever happened to you ,
like--like water just--just oozing out of my eyeballs
like i &apos;m some alien creature excreting fluids .
you mean you cried .
yes ! and after that was done ,
i burned the letter ,
and the feelings--oop-- were still there .
so i really feel strongly that jo needs to know how sorry i am
for destroying our family ,
but let &apos;s face it , guys , all right ?
i mean , elena , you of all people
should be willing to look past the questionable things
that i &apos;ve done to see that there &apos;s--there &apos;s good somewhere in me .
you did it with damon .
ok . i think we &apos;re done here . come on .
actually ,
what if there &apos;s something he can do for us in exchange ?
so i &apos;m guessing you didn &apos;t bring me out here
to watch you perv out on some co @-@ ed .
it &apos;s not just some co @-@ ed .
meet the real sarah salvatore ,
the hothouse flower stefan &apos;s been keeping secret all these years .
why do you even care ?
because damon thinks he killed sarah ,
and instead of absolving him ,
stefan &apos;s been using damon &apos;s guilt to keep him in check .
not very brotherly now , is it ?
so i help you destroy some innocent girl or what ?
you &apos;re gonna kill me ?
then go ahead and kill me .
i don &apos;t want to kill you , matt .
i just want you to do a few simple tasks .
screw you ! i &apos;m not gonna be your bitch for the rest of my life .
i don &apos;t want to kill you ,
but i will kill you .
oh . look at that .
very brave .
i admire your tolerance for pain .
does that run in your family ?
just wondering if your mother shares your pain threshold .
took a drive down to south carolina
to take a peek at mama donovan .
quite a dish , that one .
good . now that that &apos;s settled ,
it &apos;s time for you to get to know sarah salvatore .
sad attempt at iron welding .
i tried to fix it .
i can &apos;t bring bonnie back with this .
i thought you were the all @-@ powerful leader of the gemini coven now .
i destroyed this
so that it couldn &apos;t be used again .
well , can we use that hunk of junk
to send a message at least ?
it is her birthday .
it is ?
yeah . it &apos;s really sad . i mean , old bon @-@ bon--
she &apos;s gonna be getting all dressed up for a party
no one &apos;s even gonna show up to .
i mean , i wonder if she even knows
that it is her birthday ,
or do all the days just blend into
one vast sea of misery ?
i wonder .
one of the crown wheels survived .
that &apos;s a positive .
plus i am megapowerful .
yeah .
what do you want to say ?
well , i mean , if bonnie needs magic to get out ,
we just need to tell her where to find some .
i was gonna wear this for the merge ceremony .
it &apos;s the dress i would have died in .
how could luke do this ?
he didn &apos;t do this to you .
kai did ,
and he &apos;s going to finish what he started
by killing you and every other gemini .
so grab whatever you need ,
and let &apos;s get out of here ,
or else luke will have died for nothing .
just haul ass out of here like my dad ?
live out the rest of my life wondering
is today the day that kai finds me ?
i should have just done the stupid merge .
at least then , luke and i would still be together .
all our lives , we &apos;ve never been apart .
i don &apos;t know how to do this .
i &apos;m so sorry , liv .
i can &apos;t run , tyler .
kai took my entire life .
there &apos;s nowhere for me to go .
look at me . look at me .
whatever you want to do ,
i will help you get through it .
fine .
then i want to kill kai .
ok . so we know that jo stored her magic
in a hunting knife .
bonnie sent hers over with miss cuddles .
what receptacle of magic am i not thinking of ?
let me give you a hint--
scorned lover .
katherine ?
older .
silas .
hotter .
i don &apos;t know .
silas was definitely hot .
qetsiyah . her blood is on silas &apos; headstone .
it &apos;s filled with magic .
yep ! so in bonnieland ,
that means that an island off nova scotia
is a big magical battery waiting to be tapped .
we just need to remind bonnie of that .
and what reminded you ?
i was gonna plan a trip there ,
change of scenery , you know .
there &apos;s only so much you can take of mystic falls on repeat .
oh , thank god .
you two together is still totally revolting to me .
finally , a familiar feeling .
luke didn &apos;t take me over completely .
what the hell &apos;s he doing here ?
you know , if you were gonna creepily stalk me ,
you could have at least brought a shovel .
nah . i &apos;m not big on digging .
calluses .
you bury corpses all the time .
yeah , but i don &apos;t dig them up .
so do you really think that finding a teddy bear
will make everything right in the world ?
you know what ? you are right .
this is such a waste of time .
i really should be at the dive bar ,
picking a fight with a stranger in order to feel pain .
look . if you think i &apos;m insane , i get it .
i probably am , but nobody is forcing you to be here .
i should probably stay , keep an eye on you ,
you know , in case you have a psychotic breakdown .
people don &apos;t just change like that .
people usually don &apos;t merge with their siblings either .
uh , for the record , i would have been fine
with any of luke &apos;s qualities ,
you know , the hair , the whole gay thing--
you know , maybe not the height actually .
you seriously buy this ?
look . i &apos;m not saying that we have to like him ,
but if there &apos;s a way for us to tell bonnie
how she can get out--
we should trust a guy that changed personalities overnight ?
think of it like elena in reverse .
you know , she was human , pure ,
dating the good salvatore .
then she became an undead blood vacuum ,
stopped caring about right and wrong ,
and started dating the bad one .
that &apos;s not how it happened .
i &apos;m sure i missed a detail or two ,
but i &apos;m just paraphrasing what
damon told me in the prison world .
speaking of , there &apos;s a witch over there we &apos;d like to save ,
so why don &apos;t you get your gemini jumper cables and fix that thing ?
ok .
what are you doing ?
liv . come on . talk to me .
what are you doing ?
when luke and i were kids ,
we used to play hide @-@ and @-@ seek .
we figured out a way to cheat
by using a spell to see through each other &apos;s eyes .
come on , kai . you done yet ?
the bastard &apos;s at the salvatore house .
why the hell would he be there ?
i have no idea .
of course , damon would find a reason to work with him .
look , liv . i know how pissed you are right now .
i get that probably more than anybody , but--
but what ? i &apos;m just supposed to live with it ,
get through it ?
something tells me you didn &apos;t just punch
a wall after your mom died .
liv , stop ! like it or not ,
kai is your leader .
you kill him , your entire coven dies--
you , your dad , jo ...
you .
we &apos;re dead anyway .
he &apos;ll kill his way through the coven ,
our friends , the guy at the drive @-@ through who screws up his order .
at least this way , i can take him with me .
wait . i told you that if anybody tried to hurt you
they &apos;d have to get through me first .
well , guess what . that includes you .
phesmatos somnumia .
i &apos;m sorry , tyler .
i got it .
i &apos;m guessing you &apos;re not here on a basketball scholarship .
that &apos;s not a regulation trashcan .
hey . i saw your camera . i &apos;m thinking about buying one .
you like it ?
it gets the job done .
what kind of photography are you into ?
a little bit of everything .
ok . well , it has good color reproduction ,
nice tonal range .
um , you &apos;ll want to shoot raw
if you don &apos;t want the highlights to get clipped ,
and ... you have no idea what i &apos;m talking about , do you ?
no . no , i don &apos;t . sorry .
well , don &apos;t feel bad . you went for it .
it &apos;s not your fault you went with the second most common pickup line
guys use when they see a girl with a camera .
oh , yeah ? what &apos;s the first ?
the offer to pose for some very tasteful nudes .
look . i &apos;m really flattered ,
and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re a nice guy , but ...
no . it &apos;s ok . i get it .
good luck with your photography .
thanks .
you truly have an epic lack of game .
i tried , ok ?
really ? grunting at her would have been more effective .
now i &apos;ve got to get you back on track .
all right . give me your jacket ,
your wallet , and your cell phone .
so i can &apos;t send us back physically ,
but i can probably send a part of us back .
probably ?
you remember that movie &quot; ghost &quot; ?
ok . well , bonnie &apos;s gonna be demi moore
because she &apos;s the alive one obviously ,
and , uh , we &apos;ll all be a collective patrick swayze ,
the ghost .
by the way , how much does that suck
about patrick swayze ?
will she be able to us or not , kai ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never done this before .
so let &apos;s all just take a deep breath , right ,
close our eyes ,
and ...
phesmatos tribum
invocio caveum ,
miscero mundio .
phesmatos tribum
invocio caveum ,
miscero mundio .
what happened to the pool table ?
oh , my god .
bonnie ? bonnie !
she can &apos;t hear me .
and we can &apos;t touch anything either .
nice spell , kai .
this place is my own personal hell .
drama queen .
reporting to you live from retro world ,
i &apos;m bonnie bennett .
joining us today in the studio
is special guest damon salvatore !
no .
what ?
the bottle of bourbon is the oldest one in the house .
we made a pact if we couldn &apos;t take
being trapped here alone for one more day
we &apos;d--we &apos;d kill that entire bottle .
then we &apos;d kill ourselves .
wait .
wait . what happened ? why are we back here ?
i don &apos;t know . spell must require too much magic .
i lost my connection .
then reconnect .
it &apos;s not that easy . you see this blood ?
i &apos;m guessing that &apos;s not a good sign .
bonnie is going to kill herself .
can she do that ? can she die in the prison world ?
i couldn &apos;t . of course ,
it was my own personal solitary confinement .
didn &apos;t want me to end my sentence early by killing myself .
ooh ! i tried every method in the book .
i drove down to d.c.
because there was this museum that has an actual guillotine .
we get it .
for whoever &apos;s not lucky enough to be you , dead means dead .
we have to stop her . we have to give her hope ,
send her a message somehow .
how ? she couldn &apos;t hear us .
the message is already there in the atlas .
i scribbled some notes on nova scotia .
we just have to get her to see it .
all right , but how do we open an atlas
if we can &apos;t touch anything ?
we need to get kai to crank up his witchy @-@ woo , don &apos;t we ,
so we can make physical contact .
all while sending the 3 of you back over there ? sure . yeah .
hey . why don &apos;t i reanimate your dead parents
for a tea party while i &apos;m at it ?
sorry .
insensitive .
what if you just send me back ?
what ? no .
that might work . focus all of my magic on one person .
it might be enough of a boost that you could physically interact
if i can hold the spell .
and if you cannot ?
the magic overwhelms me ,
and i can &apos;t pull jeremy out .
he &apos;ll be stuck over there for eternity .
jer .
don &apos;t . don &apos;t say anything .
if i can get through to her ,
we save bonnie &apos;s life .
if not ...
at least i &apos;ll be with her when she dies .
hey . is that an m &amp; m ?
where ?
right there .
little to the left , little to the left .
right there , right-- oh , ohh .
sorry . it was just a leaf .
is this funny to you ?
well , we are in the middle of the woods ,
searching for a teddy bear
buried in a shallow grave
by a 9 @-@ year @-@ old version of you .
i can &apos;t even say that with a straight face ,
so , yeah , that is funny .
you &apos;re drunk .
give me that .
no , no , no .
you have more ground to cover .
you &apos;re a jerk .
jerk , huh ?
yeah .
oh , you sound angry .
i &apos;m not angry , ok ?
i &apos;m just annoyed
because i am going through a highly emotional situation right now ,
and you &apos;re just sitting there , mocking me .
definitely angry .
i &apos;m not angry , ok ?
well , you should be .
your mom is dying , your best friend is stuck in some netherworld ,
and you &apos;re sitting here trying to make it all better
by finding a stuffed animal ?
shut up !
that make you feel better ?
no .
try again .
screw you !
that &apos;s good . get it out .
i cannot believe you just did that .
well , you started it .
felt good , though , didn &apos;t it ?
maybe a little .
phesmatos tribum ...
i didn &apos;t know you and bonnie had a death pact .
it was my idea .
i thought of it after we watched &quot; the bodyguard &quot; for the billionth time .
phesmatos tribum ...
i never thought she &apos;d go through with it .
invocio caveum ...
i can &apos;t watch this .
phesmatos tribum
invocio caveum ,
miscero mundio .
hey , ansel adams .
i have no idea who that is .
where are you trying to go ?
virginia . mystic falls .
virginia ?
this is a campus bus .
it has , like , 5 stops .
the farthest you &apos;re gonna get is the lenox hospital .
great . my buddy bailed on me ,
and my phone and jacket are in his car .
this is why i don &apos;t visit animal shelters .
come on . i &apos;ll show you where you can catch a real bus .
oh , that &apos;d be great .
i &apos;m--i &apos;m freezing out here .
there &apos;s a cafe on the way .
we &apos;ll get a coffee , and you can warm up .
too bad my wallet &apos;s in my jacket .
how were you planning on paying for the bus ?
charm .
yeah . in that case , i &apos;ll buy you a bus ticket
to go with that coffee .
thank you .
come on .
our suicide bourbon .
bonnie and i made a pact we &apos;d drink this together .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m gonna do .
to you , bonnie .
so is kai right about me ?
by turning into a vampire , i completely changed ?
kai &apos;s a psychopath .
don &apos;t let him get in your head .
i &apos;m not ,
but do you ever think about it ,
like , if i would still be with you if i was human ?
ok . we &apos;re doing this .
it &apos;s just a question , damon .
no .
&quot; no &quot; what ?
no . i don &apos;t think we &apos;d be together
if you were still human .
you had a choice . you chose stefan .
human you was on your way home to him .
car went off the bridge , you turned ,
and suddenly , i was back in the picture .
i &apos;m gonna go check on jer .
what &apos;s going on ?
ok . 1994 . let &apos;s do this .
where &apos;s the stupid map ?
it &apos;s working .
hurry up and find nova scotia .
nova scotia . got it .
what !
kai , do something !
kai ?
no ! what are you doing ?
dang , sis . that was harsh .
shut up !
phesmatos--
it &apos;s all coming back to me , livvie poo .
you know , the charge ...
stop it , kai !
that races through your bones ...
stop it !
at the prospect of watching someone burn to death ?
i really missed that feeling .
just kill me , kai .
you already killed my best friend .
so just do it .
get it over with .
why can &apos;t i do this ?
i don &apos;t care about you .
why can &apos;t i kill you ?
come on . kai , do it . do it .
come onnnnn ! kill her !
motus !
what the hell is happening ?
liv is trying to kill kai .
jeremy !
jeremy !
send me back . please .
jeremy , look at me .
i &apos;m half @-@ dead .
i need to stop bonnie .
ok . ok .
phesmatos tribum ,
invocio caveum ,
miscero mundio .
cheers to making it this far .
ok . think it &apos;s time i cut myself off .
stay here .
well , i think i got all the catharsis out of this that i &apos;m gonna get .
let &apos;s go home .
all right .
wait a minute .
what is that ?
shut up .
no , no , no . i &apos;m serious .
is that an ear ?
oh , my god .
cuddles ? !
i &apos;m sure we can clean her up ,
make her as good as new .
yeah .
it &apos;ll be ...
i &apos;m sorry .
kai !
get out here !
she &apos;s right below us .
you can &apos;t hide from me !
what are you doing ?
i said i was saving this for something special .
no ! come on !
you don &apos;t want to do this .
just turn off the car , bon .
you can &apos;t die .
it &apos;s probably a waste of time even recording anything ,
but , damon , elena , whoever ,
you find this and you figure out how to work this stupid thing ,
please tell everyone that i &apos;m sorry .
bonnie .
tell them that i tried .
i really tried to make it work .
you know , i just miss too much .
i miss saying hi to strangers ...
ordering dinner in a restaurant ,
laughing with my friends ...
but , um , spending every day here alone
with no one to talk to ,
going weeks without speaking ,
it &apos;s just the loneliness .
it &apos;s something i can &apos;t take it .
and i only know one way to turn it off .
i &apos;m sorry .
jeremy .
i @-@ i hope you &apos;re living your life
with no regrets .
i hope you fight for the life you want ,
and don &apos;t ever give up on yourself
and stay strong .
something my grams said .
stay ... strong .
come on , bonnie . get up !
come on .
got to stay strong .
i &apos;m not gonna die in this place !
come on ! get up !
bonnie , get up !
open ! come on !
come on !
oh , jeremy . jeremy .
hey , jeremy . wake up .
kai , hey ! wake up ! damn it !
jeremy , wake up .
jer , wake up .
jeremy .
i &apos;m ok .
bonnie , i @-@ is she ...
i saw her .
sh @-@ she &apos;s gonna be ok .
i might be able to salvage a piece if you &apos;re interested .
don &apos;t think bonnie would want us to let cake go to waste .
you know , i get it . i get what she was going through ,
why she would want to end it ,
feeling trapped and alone .
every day is the same--
disappointment , misery .
you go to sleep and wake up
and do it all over again ?
but she &apos;s not the only one that &apos;s trapped .
jeremy , i know what you &apos;ve been going through .
don &apos;t tell me i got to be strong .
actually , i was gonna say it &apos;s ok to move on .
bonnie decided to save herself ,
and from what you told me ,
i think she wants you to do the same .
go to art school . we &apos;ll all help you .
just ... just find the life that you want
and be happy .
what about you ?
i &apos;ll be fine .
i promise .
just get out of here ...
and don &apos;t look back .
how did i get back here ?
well , first , i woke up on the floor .
guess a pillow would have been too much to ask for ,
and when i figured out where you &apos;d gone ,
i raced over to the salvatore house ,
only to find you unconscious .
i convinced elena to give you some of her blood ...
and now that i see you &apos;re ok ,
i never want to see you again .
tyler , wait !
you lied to me .
no ! i never wanted to hurt you !
you lied to me !
please just calm down .
i &apos;m not gonna calm down .
i would have done anything for you ,
and you chose death over me .
so ? how was your little coffee date ?
you fancy her , don &apos;t you ?
what was the point of this ?
you were a test .
i wanted to see what kind of a person
the last remaining salvatore really is .
what kind of person she is ?
well , she spurned your comically inept attempts to charm her
and yet proved to be a good samaritan when you needed assistance .
on a scale of 1 @-@ 10,
i &apos;d say her purity ranks about ... 9.5 .
when i &apos;m through with her , she &apos;ll be a one .
so what--you &apos;re gonna compel her to be bad ?
i &apos;m not gonna compel her .
i want sarah to know that everything she did
was of her own free will .
what are you talking about ?
i &apos;m going to insinuate myself into her life ,
make her do things she &apos;d never dream of doing
until she begs me to make her a vampire .
stefan thought he could protect her .
i &apos;m gonna show him how wrong he is .
so jer &apos;s applying to art school .
might want to compel him a decent portfolio
because he ain &apos;t that great .
don &apos;t be mean .
he needs to move on with his life , and ...
so do i.
i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m a fan of that transition .
look . i &apos;ve ...
made some huge mistakes in my life .
being with you wasn &apos;t one of them ,
and , yes , i had alaric compel away my love for you ,
and , yes , i did love stefan once .
the night i died ,
matt was driving me back to him ,
and yet i found my way back to you .
damon , i somehow always find my way back to you .
it doesn &apos;t matter if i have memories or not .
it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m a vampire or not .
you &apos;re just saying that because you can &apos;t change what you are .
no , damon . i don &apos;t care what human me would have done
because she &apos;s not here .
i am .
and if the past is a place
without you and me together , then ...
let &apos;s stop living in it .
yeah .
