here ? you &apos;re dropping me off here ?
r @-@ right in front of this obvious pickpocket ?
look at the size of that guy .
he &apos;s clearly new homeless .
we &apos;re a mile away from the loft , cece .
i &apos;m not getting caught with you .
i &apos;m gonna have to run all the way home .
and i have my slippiest loafers on .
if i were you , i would get walking right now .
you &apos;re never gonna get home before dawn .
okay , look , i &apos;m fine with you not telling anybody about us ,
but you cannot just call me at anytime
and just summon me for intercourse .
i have no control here ,
and i &apos;m stressed out all day long .
it &apos;s like you &apos;re ripping the side block out of my mental jenga .
i &apos;m totally falling apart .
okay , schmidt , you ...
you really need to learn to take a breath
and calm down , all right ?
we &apos;re just being a little spontaneous .
words that have never been used to describe schmidt :
&quot; spontaneous , flexible , easy @-@ going . &quot;
i &apos;m like a marine .
you &apos;re nothing like a marine .
i &apos;m totally like a marine , all right ? you know what ?
fine . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m out of here .
take these ,
and take care of them-- i can get a tetanus shot ,
but i can &apos;t cure damaged suede .
can you believe i found this on the street ?
who would want to throw this away ?
a blind man who suddenly recovered his sight ?
get rid of it , jess--
pine has no place in this loft .
it &apos;s the wood of poor people and outhouses .
i pay rent ,
so i think that gives me the right to add a few things .
jess ...
you &apos;re wrong .
okay ?
my answer &apos;s no .
well , my answer is yes .
i &apos;m keeping the hutch .
i had a bad night .
i &apos;m really , i &apos;m just asking you , please d @-@ don &apos;t push me .
&apos;cause then i &apos;ll have to reinstate my ban on high @-@ waisted shorts .
you would not dare .
try me .
that was the worst four weeks of my life .
hey , winston ,
why are you still drinking ?
it &apos;s 10 : 00 in the morning , man .
yeah , i know what it &apos;ll feel like when i stop ,
so i &apos;m just gonna stay a little drunk , forever .
well , why is there no girl version of you , my man ?
moving on .
so , last night &apos;s poker game .
got pretty intense .
i don &apos;t even know what you &apos;re talking about-
i was so hammered last night .
i &apos;ve never been more sober in my whole life .
i &apos;ll remember this as long as i live .
i &apos;m all in . uno , bitches .
read &apos; em and weep .
straight flush .
so , what do i owe you , 20 bucks ?
20 bucks ?
yeah .
you owe me $ 487 .
come on , winston !
aah ! schmidt makes me so mad !
i want to put one thing , one thing in the living room ,
and he won &apos;t let me .
i &apos;m not putting up with this .
oh , yes , you are .
we live in a fragile ecosystem .
it &apos;s a delicate balance .
it &apos;s a broken ecosystem ,
dominated by an apex predator .
chill out , jess .
we let him run the house , no big deal .
the boy cooks and cleans--
and happily , i might add .
yeah , he probably couldn &apos;t sleep last night
&apos;cause he was so excited to clean up after us .
i know he &apos;s been bad lately , but ...
schmidt &apos;s an odd bird .
he can &apos;t handle it when things aren &apos;t clean and orderly .
it &apos;s been that way since the day he moved in .
welcome to your new home , schmidt .
come on , play ball .
coming home !
well , i &apos;m fed up with it .
and he &apos;s got to learn how to relax .
and , nick , why do you have ...
cannons drawn all over your back ?
those aren &apos;t cannons , jess .
long @-@ stem mushrooms ?
nope .
oh , so that &apos;s ...
not a mossy cave .
mmm , no . probably not .
what the ... ?
what is happening ... ?
i can &apos;t take this right now .
what , do we live in a pawnshop ?
hey , schmidt .
hey , jess . what , uh ...
where did all this come from ?
i found the afghan underneath a dumpster outside an animal shelter .
and i found the lamp underneath the afghan .
i &apos;m gonna assume that these are your spices
jammed in here with my spices . yep .
i would really appreciate it if your non @-@ tahitian vanilla
was not touching my tahitian vanilla .
oh , schmidt , they &apos;re more than touching .
what &apos;s it like living in the most populous isle
in french polynesia ?
i could tell you , or ... i could show you .
not in front of the cloves .
where &apos;s my burr coffee grinder ?
oh , you know , i think it &apos;s in the hutch .
you put it in the hutch ?
the ... aah , this thing was on the street .
it &apos;s a coffee grinder , schmidt .
i think it &apos;ll be okay .
a top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line conical burr coffee grinder .
you know what that means ? it means it doesn &apos;t
smash up the beans like some pedestrian blade grinder .
it actually grinds them ,
for a deeper , richer ,
more satisfying flavor profile !
oh . well , i &apos;ve used it repeatedly to make homemade crayons .
does that show up in your flavor profile , schmidt ?
uh , yeah , that &apos;s fine .
if you &apos;re looking for your oven mitts ,
they &apos;re in the top drawer of the hutch .
oh . okay , fair enough .
hutch is gone .
no . no !
no , no , no .
no hutch .
no , no !
stop ! don &apos;t move the hutch .
bye @-@ bye , hutch !
this thing makes me emotionally nauseous !
this is my hutch . don &apos;t move it !
all right , you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right ...
i &apos;m so sorry . you &apos;re right .
it &apos;s a beautiful piece .
it looks great there .
my apologies .
thank you .
schmidt , you have a real problem .
you &apos;ve got to learn to calm down .
yeah , yeah .
i love the beach .
now , isn &apos;t this better than arguing about a hutch ?
yeah , if you like hanging out
on the rim of a giant fish toilet .
jess , i can &apos;t believe you brought me down here .
this is a great place to talk about your problems .
jess , this sucks-- i just want to go home .
schmidt , come here .
look . you got the birds in the sky .
sea and sand .
the wind in our hair .
you &apos;ve lost your kite !
have fun flying your string all day !
sorry i forgot my wallet .
thank you for paying , it &apos;s delicious .
yeah , which is weird ,
because i clearly remember saying ,
&quot; hey , man , don &apos;t forget your wallet . &quot;
and then i still forgot it .
you still forget it .
wow , it &apos;s weird .
yeah , you said that .
yeah , i said that .
we &apos;re getting older .
okay , this is a good segue .
um ... can i talk to you about something that &apos;s kind of tough ?
yeah , man , shoot .
&quot; the subject of this talk
is the debt of money between us .
i feel that ... &quot;
oh , man !
i thought this was about something serious .
you set that up like it was about something different .
this is about the poker ?
oh , i &apos;ll pay you your money . relax .
&quot; if i am reading this section , then i can only assume
&quot; you have told me to relax .
you wrote that ?
&quot; let me assure you i am very relaxed ,
although i have good reason not to be ,
as you owe me a very large sum . &quot;
i will pay you the money , you clown .
&quot; i am aware that we &apos;re both broke ,
one of us embarrassingly so . points to nick .
i have recently tumbled down the socioeconomic ladder
and have hit rock bottom ,
where you , nick miller ,
have been waiting patiently for the past 15 years .
but i want that money .
give me my money . i really mean it .
it &apos;s my money . you owe me that money ,
so give me my money . seriously . &quot;
are you finished ?
&quot; where is the money , dude ?
you wrote &quot; dude &quot; ?
&quot; but i am not without pity .
i am willing to just call it an even $ 200 . &quot;
everything let go with just $ 200 ?
right .
all right , i can do $ 200 .
$ 200 ? two hundo clean ?
yep .
all right .
i did pay for gas here , though .
so that &apos;s , let &apos;s say , ten bucks .
so we &apos;re at $ 190 .
we &apos;ll say clean $ 190 .
i hate to be this guy ...
but i got the fights on friday ,
so that &apos;s $ 30 . so let &apos;s call it $ 160
and be done with it .
$ 20 for beer that night , so $ 160 takes us to $ 140 .
just to be fair . and i didn &apos;t write a stupid letter about it .
but let &apos;s say right now $ 140 .
you ate a lot of the nachos !
littering ! $ 15 for littering !
how fun is this !
it &apos;s not my cup of tea .
no !
no ! no , jess , no !
i can &apos;t believe i never noticed this before , but , schmidt ,
you are legitimately crazy .
i think we &apos;re all a little bit crazy , don &apos;t you think , jess ?
no , i mean , you &apos;re like aging- ballerina ,
child @-@ chess @-@ prodigy , professional @-@ magician crazy .
it &apos;s my mom &apos;s fault-- you know , i come from a jewish family ,
but she used to tell me the reason santa didn &apos;t come to our house
was because my room was dirty .
the only thing i ever controlled was what i ate .
that &apos;s why i got fat .
yeah , i got fat &apos; cause i used to eat
concord grape jelly from the jar using a candy bar as a fork .
it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t have any structure .
you know what i mean ? that &apos;s what happens
when you don &apos;t have any rules .
none of these people have rules . especially that guy .
he &apos;s wearing ladies &apos; bikini bottoms .
jess , i &apos;m not like these people , okay ?
i don &apos;t have dreadlocks . i don &apos;t own a snake .
and i don &apos;t understand how these people think that they &apos;re relaxed ,
because they &apos;re not-- they just have nothing to do .
that &apos;s not me . it &apos;s not that easy for me .
sounds to me like a lot of excuses , schmidt .
just be spontaneous .
hey , nick .
look , man , i &apos;m sorry to bother you while you &apos;re clearly
sitting here working hard making lots of money .
all right .
but if you &apos;d kindly just pause that for one second ,
i have a few accounts that i &apos;d like to settle .
account number one :
a $ 15 receipt for a chinatown box turtle .
bam . here we go .
we &apos;re doing this , huh ?
yeah , we are doing this . item number two :
cancelled $ 35 check for registration of a domain name--
&quot; it &apos;s nick miller time.com. &quot;
&quot; hey , guys , winston , i got a good idea , man .
i &apos;m gonna be a big @-@ time blogger . &quot;
i have to go to work ...
... at a bar , where you drink for free .
how much does 400 cognac and colas add up to , winston ?
you want to go there ? okay . sure .
how about all the times i sat around listening to you bitch and moan
about how caroline broke your precious little heart ?
okay , in eighth grade ...
eighth grade .
... you &quot; accidentally &quot; saw my mom naked .
before she stopped exercising and let herself get chubby .
so how much is that , in terms of money ?
&apos;cause i haven &apos;t gotten over that .
and i would say four to $ 5,000 .
hey , guys . hey , guys .
schmidt , winston saw my mother
naked in eighth grade ; in terms of ...
i waded into the ocean without my aqua socks .
mm , he did it .
i did it .
he let go .
he washed his hands in a public restroom .
and there was a man in there .
and he was using the toilet , full sit , no door .
and i didn &apos;t break eye contact .
not once .
that &apos;s not letting go , that &apos;s cruising .
hey , schmidt .
there &apos;s a spill .
i know .
do your exercise . you know .
yeah , okay , the exercise .
one , two , three , four , five , six ,
seven , eight , nine , ten .
i feel great .
i &apos;m gonna go take a shower with nick &apos;s bar soap ,
like a common ranch hand .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
what is going on ?
you messed with the ecosystem .
and you guys said it couldn &apos;t be done .
you have no idea what you &apos;re getting into .
you &apos;re welcome .
schmidt , you &apos;re killing me with that drumming !
you &apos;re killing me !
look at this mess . how did this happen ?
so , this is your fault .
no . no .
this is good for schmidt .
&apos;cause you guys have been taking advantage of him for years .
you make him cook , you make him clean ...
where &apos;s my money , dude ?
frankly , it &apos;s ... sexist .
oh , my god . ew @
how &apos;s it sexist ?
who &apos;s cleaning up ?
i cleaned this morning .
all right , fine .
i &apos;ll clean , you guys go to the store .
i &apos;m not going to the store with him .
stop throwing things at each other .
where &apos;s my money , dude ... ?
oh , come on .
where is the money ?
you &apos;re a child . ... - my car , too , while you ...
silence , friends !
i made you necklaces .
hey , do you want to go to the store ?
please , god , yes .
$ 100 ?
how did schmidt buy all these groceries with 100 bucks ?
it &apos;s only $ 100 ?
$ 100 .
you should &apos;ve told ... we have way too much stuff , man .
yeah , like shrimp cocktail .
we don &apos;t need a baked ham .
all right .
winston ?
sorry about that .
really ?
two cake mixes ?
really ? all these soups ? pizza ? frozen pizza ?
you fat ass .
what are you trying to do , die ?
shut up , dude .
we have enough ketchup .
we have enough ketchup !
come on , really ?
next , please .
oh , hey , how you doing , sir ?
we only have $ 100 , gary ,
so could you stop checking us out when we hit $ 100 ?
yeah , you got to include tax , too ,
so , like , $ 93 , just ... cool ?
yeah , just that &apos;ll do .
okay , guys .
thanks . i &apos;m gonna put my stuff at the front ,
&apos;cause you obviously don &apos;t know how to shop .
you &apos;re being ridiculous .
are you getting me ?
we have enough ketchup .
epsom salt ?
what , are you too good for regular salt ?
you know damn well i got to soak my trick foot .
oh , winnie , your little trick foot .
yeah , my trick foot , and don &apos;t ever call me winnie .
aw , winnie ...
fine .
you don &apos;t owe me anything .
the slate is clean . we &apos;re good , we &apos;re even .
oh , good , that &apos;s how i feel , too .
because in my mind , your mom will always be the winner of best boobs
really , best boobs ?
yeah . master &apos;s division .
you &apos;re gonna talk about my mother ?
you &apos;re gonna talk about my mom &apos;s boobs ?
is that ... you gonna go there ?
don &apos;t push me in a supermarket , man .
you started this .
did you just slap me in the face ?
no , i did not .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
i &apos;m not afraid of you , man .
don &apos;t act your ...
grow up , dude !
hey , schmidt .
oh , hello , jess .
hey . what are you doing out here ?
oh , just checking up on you .
oh , i see you &apos;re eating street meat wrapped in street meat .
this is my man , gordon .
you &apos;ve outdone yourself once again , gordon .
excellent .
did you go to work today ?
no , no . no work .
i haven &apos;t been there in a while .
how long is a while ?
i don &apos;t know . three days ?
schmidt , i made a mistake in bringing you down here .
i shouldn &apos;t have done that .
please come home .
why ?
so i can cook and clean ?
so i can show you where the vacuum is ?
all right .
okay , fine , i don &apos;t know where the vacuum is .
that is one reason why i came here ,
but i really want you to come home .
everything &apos;s falling apart without you .
nick and winston are fighting all the time .
and all of us lost our keys to the mailbox .
schmidt , just listen to me , because you
don &apos;t belong here , like , really .
do you remember when you got yourself off to
an inconvenient truth ?
how about when you dress up
like shia labeouf from wall street two for halloween ?
do you remember when you said
jazz music was america &apos;s greatest mistake ?
say it in drums , jessica day .
me hablo drums .
hey , man .
i got the last frozen thing .
i was gonna ice my wrist , but ...
how about this ?
take half , pal .
so kind of you .
that hurts , man .
i am so hungry .
remember those things that schmidt used to make us
with the peanut butter and the raisins on the celery ?
what were those called ?
ants on a log .
ants on a log .
i just got why they &apos;re called ants on a log .
looks like ants on a log .
i &apos;m hungry , man .
hey , schmidt , is that you , buddy ?
no , it &apos;s me .
what the hell happened to you ?
i went down to the beach ,
and i tried to talk to schmidt ,
but he just ignored me ,
and he went back to twirling his fire baton .
he &apos;s really bad . he burned a lot of people .
i feel like they should let you twirl it around a few times
before they actually light it on fire .
well , look , jess , being friends with schmidt is really complicated .
&apos;cause you want to change him so badly ,
but you can &apos;t &apos; cause he &apos;ll just get worse .
you guys were right , i upset the ecosystem .
this is not what i wanted .
i just wanted to put my hutch here .
make the place my own , be a part of the family .
what family ? with these clowns ?
yeah , you clowns .
well , look , you want in , you &apos;re in .
congratulations , welcome to the family , jess .
yeah , we don &apos;t &quot; aww &quot; in this family .
hey , guys .
hey , schmidt .
um , we need to talk .
something not cool ?
schmidt , we miss you .
you just want me to clean .
no , that &apos;s not true .
well , it &apos;s a little bit true . there &apos;s truth to that .
okay , look . i want you to clean .
look , we &apos;re so proud of you for letting go , and relaxing .
but this isn &apos;t like you .
you can run away from your problems ,
but you &apos;re just gonna find new ones that pop up like hepatitis .
and nick and winston
want to say to you that they really miss you .
you &apos;re freaking me out , man .
why are you wearing that crystal around your neck ?
nick , the crystal symbolizes energy .
all a crystal is is rock poo , schmidt .
look , i need you , schmidt .
okay , i need you to tell me what pants not to wear
and to exercise more often .
i need you to make fun of me
when i call a panini a hot sandwich ;
how am i ever gonna learn ?
i even miss your hair chutney .
without you , man , we &apos;re just three idiots who live together .
you make us a family .
well , i &apos;m the cool rebel brother .
you &apos;re the mom .
the mother .
mom .
look , schmidt , if you come back to us ,
i &apos;ll let you clean my room .
the white whale ?
think about how many dust bunnies are under my bed .
how many stray socks .
hey , schmidt ,
i got you something .
is that a boutique box ?
a pair of gray , shiny , twill , flat @-@ front trousers
designed by a man named calvin .
never been tried on .
pockets are sewn shut .
don &apos;t you just want to get your thumbs in there and rip ?
okay , so , i &apos;m just gonna leave this on your bongo drum ,
and you can , you know ,
give them a whirl if you feel like it .
just make the right decision .
come home .
take the pants .
oh , come here .
calvin .
you magnificent wizard .
scmidtty .
nick , your hair is doing that thing that i just ... i just hate .
and jess , can you please ask winston to help you
move the furniture out ? he could use the exercise .
you &apos;re looking a little , you know ...
he &apos;s back .
and nick , winston , we have a urinal .
how are you still missing ?
schmidt
schmidt , wake up .
what ...
are you doing here ?
what do you think i &apos;m doing here ? come on !
okay , wait , wait , wait .
what ?
cece ,
before we continue ,
i clearly have no control in this relationship ,
and ... i &apos;m fine with it .
good .
but know this ,
you &apos;re the one who broke into this apartment at 3 : 00 a.m.
for a little bit of this schmidt ,
so who &apos;s really in control ?
shut up !
wait , oh , are you sleeping in dress pants ?
what ? they &apos;re slacks .
what &apos;s the big deal ? calm down .
look how excited hector j. is to see you .
yeah , i &apos;ve already met hector j. , so ...
ooh , look , he &apos;s knighting you .
oh , no , please stop knighting me . don &apos;t ...
lady cecelia ...
no , schmidt , i &apos;m gonna leave .
you have entered the order of the round table .
i &apos;m getting my bag , okay , i &apos;m gonna get my ...
