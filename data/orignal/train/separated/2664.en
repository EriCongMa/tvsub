Critical hit. He couldn't have gone far.
He wouldn't go to a hospital.
The bleeder works for Kirk.
He'll know where to find them.
I have a location.
I was trying to help. He has to know that.
I'm not on your side here, Kate.
I need to speak with the patient.
He's gone.
As you well know, one of the keys to my success
is a clear and consistent understanding
of my own limitations.
So often people overestimate themselves,
misapply their gifts.
The cleaner suddenly fancies herself the strategist.
Wisdom is learning the boundaries
of one's designated lane.
For instance, this, I will do poorly.
Clumsily, with more mess than necessary.
It'll take longer
and be considerably more unpleasant to boot.
But I can't very well have you do it, can I?
Raymond Reddington, my favorite rubio.
My God, I haven't seen you since you snuck off at Carnival.
Red, Jesus.
What's wrong with you?
We're looking for a name.
Take a close look, Manny.
He worked for a man who abducted someone I care about.
He's a cop.
Who's his rabbi?
I don't know, but I know who might.
Is it true? She's alive?
Apparently.
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
How is that...there were complications during labor.
And the doctor, he declared her dead.
He lied.
But there was a funeral. I-I was a pallbearer.
Yes, and who knows what was in that casket?
It was a charade, Aram.
So Agent Keen is alive?
but her funeral and her death...
She faked her death. Why would she do that?
To get away from Reddington.
So that her and Tom and Agnes
could have a normal life.
Away from us?
Yes, after everything we did for her.
Best we could tell,
Liz and Tom's plan was to go into hiding in Cuba.
Alexander Kirk found them.
Why? What does he want with Agent Keen?
Look, all we know right now is that
when Reddington got there, Liz and Tom were gone.
I just got off the phone with the embassy in Havana.
Briefed them on Kirk, gave them the tail number to his plane.
If that was how he was planning to get off the island,
that's not gonna happen.
And, uh, what about Agnes?
At this point, we don't know.
Notify FBI headquarters.
Elizabeth Keen is alive.
The plane is ready.
Mato and the baby?
Not yet.
Notify me as soon as they're here.
My baby.
She's on her way.
That's what you said before.
Masha...
My name is Elizabeth.
I understand that you have questions, that you're upset.
I'm sorry it has to be like this.
You're not my father.
Well, I am, Masha. I am.
And I intend to prove that to you.
Agnes will be brought here,
but the person doing that has a job to do first.
What job? With Tom?
What are you doing to Tom?
Let me out!
There's nothing more depressing than a failed Communist state.
It doesn't even really pay to be corrupt.
When dirty cops play poker in America,
they're able to play for real money.
Let's raise the stakes.
A new game.
You tell me who the head worked for,
you keep the money, a 5-way split.
We're keeping the money.
A young woman and her child were taken.
A Russian has entered the country.
I have it on good authority
your friend here was assisting him.
I think it's time for you to leave.
Make that a 4-way split.
I'll give you a name.
Well, isn't this your lucky day?
The head worked for a Jhosep Balzan?
I've never heard of him.
Yeah, he's a supplier of all manner of contraband on the island.
If the people you're looking for are still in Cuba,
Balzan is protecting them.
Should I assemble a team?
Dembe, call Silvio in San Cristóbal.
Tell him to put a team together. We're going after Elizabeth.
第四季第一集

Here.
You think I'd drug you?
You kidnapped my infant daughter,
my husband, and me.
I'd say you're capable of anything.
Listen...
you were my entire life.
You were all your mother and I ever cared about.
Now you don't know any of that
because Reddington took you away from us
when you were just a little girl.
He and your mother had an affair.
For a time, I thought maybe he was the father,
but I have proof that he's not.
He's just a spiteful, evil man.
Couldn't accept it when Katarina broke off the affair.
One day I came home, and you were gone.
He'd taken you.
I never thought I'd ever see you again...
until there you were in the news,
you... and Reddington,
the most wanted fugitives in the world.
If you cared so much about me,
you wouldn't hold me hostage.
He'd taken my beautiful child and turned her into a criminal.
Attack my wedding, everyone I love.
Everything I did was to get my child away from Reddington.
Who understands that more than you?
You did the exact same thing,
faked your own death to get your child away from him.
We have a problem.
The PNR have surrounded the plane.
Then find another plane.
Agnes will be here shortly.
And Tom?
Hey, they have my baby! Please!
Keen, you breathe a word,
I'm gonna fire two bullets --
one in the cop
and the other between the eyes of that screaming kid.
You got it?
He's got a gun!
No, don't -- please!
Where are we on Kirk?
PNR grounded his plane.
There's no sign of him or Keen.
I informed the Bureau
that Elizabeth Keen has risen from the dead.
They said three Hail Mary's
and they're on the lookout for the zombie apocalypse.
I understand. You feel played.
Don't you, sir?
Look, we should be halfway to Havana by now.
Why? She obviously doesn't want our help.
Maybe or maybe not, but she needs it.
You're willing to risk your life after what she did?
All right, let's just have this conversation.
Keen lied to us, took advantage of all of us,
and no one is more upset about that than I.
Or...relieved.
Truth be told, I didn't think it was possible
to be this joyous and livid at the same time.
But I have a job to do --
find Keen and her family
and bring them home safely.
And I know that no matter how I feel,
I can do that job.
I need to know if each of you can say the same.
Hello, Raymond.
Elizabeth, are you okay?
Of course she is.
Unlike you, I would never hurt my own daughter.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth.
?I'm on your left.
Constantin.
What do you want? Name it.
You bring her out unharmed, you'll have it.
Of course, the Concierge of Crime wants to cut a deal.
You'll give me whatever I want?
Yes.
In exchange for Masha?
Whatever you desire.
What I desire is to raise my child,
to watch her grow,
and to have back the 26 years of being a father
that you took from me.
But you can't give me that, can you?
No, she was never yours to raise.
Patrol unit incoming.
Military patrol. Armored military.
Agnes. Do you have Agnes?
I don't have her.
Go. Find Agnes and Tom.
I'm not leaving here without you.
You just don't get it, do you, Raymond?
She doesn't want to be with you.
That's why she faked her own death --
to get away from you.
Raymond, we have to go now.
If they get you, they'll kill you.
Raymond.
Did you hear me? You have to go.
Go!
Elizabeth, I will come for you.
Harold, gather your team.
Reddington. Where are you?
Tell me you have Agent Keen.
No, but she's still on the island.
Kirk's preparing her exit plan.
I don't know what the preparations are,
but I know who can find out -- Manuel Esteban.
The Chilean Spymaster?
Who's Esteban?
Our next Blacklister.
Manuel Orentez Esteban.
Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death
that institutionalized
a state-sponsored system of terror
through abuse, abduction, and murder.
According to our database, he died in 1989.
Except he didn't.
Esteban is alive and well and a legendary enforcer
for a series of authoritarian regimes.
Assuming what you say is true and Esteban is alive,
what makes you think he can help locate Keen?
Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.
If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.
We'll never find Esteban in time.
We have no assets in Cuba.
Of course you do, Harold.
Esteban. He works for your government.
Castro took him in, and the CIA immediately
put him on the payroll as a double agent.
What little you know
about the inner workings of the Cuban government
is courtesy of Manuel Esteban.
The CIA knows where to find him,
and he knows where to find Elizabeth.
What are you talking to Reddington for?
I thought your task force
was disbanded after Agent Keen's death.
It turns out she's not dead. She's been kidnapped.
And if we have any hope for finding her,
it rests in finding Esteban.
I need to know where to find him.
I hate getting into bed with Reddington.
I...hate needing him
and his list.
If you find Agent Keen,
will he continue to give you names?
He just did -- Esteban.
According to him, Esteban works for the agency.
Good Lord.
Is there anything that man doesn't know?
How can we contact him?
The agency reaches out to him
through the State Department's weekly travel advisory.
Set a meeting, a message is encoded in the advisory,
detailing where and when.
The meeting is set for the National Museum.
You'll be going to Cuba undercover, as tourists.
He'll be going. Not me.
You may be fine with doing this job, no matter how you feel.
I can't.
How you feel?
How about how Keen feels?
Forget about what she did
and try to figure out why she did it.
I have, and someday, maybe I'll be okay with it.
But right now I'm not.
What? You're okay with this?
No.
But for now, I accept it.
You'll be going alone. Here's how it's gonna work.
Your agent will be detailed
with the Dallas/Fort Worth Arts and Cultural Committee.
Esteban will expect to meet at the Café Aventura
across from the National Museum.
Once inside, take a table in the back, order an egg coffee.
I appreciate you burning a source for this.
You knowing he exists is the least of Esteban's problems.
Now that we're all chummy with the Cubanos,
his relationship with the agency is, uh,
something of a liability.
You're gonna scrub him?
Let's just say, if you wanna reach out to Esteban,
you should do it quickly.
Jesus. Hot as balls in here.
You guys actually drink this stuff?
Kill him first. Come back for the cop.
Meet you at that place.
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!
Romina.
Move it. Hey.
Let her go.
Look, you can take me, all right?
Do whatever you want. Just give me my little girl!
Hey! I'm begging you! Give me my little girl!
Please!
You and I are gonna have some fun, man.
Don't talk. They'll kill us.
Where are we?
How many people does he have down there?
My family. They have a way out.
He wants me to tell him how.
He's going to kill me.
I've seen his face. Anyone who sees --
It's him.
Right. Upright.
So the rumors are true.
They sent you to finish me.
Not quite, no.
The Americans want me dead,
so our relationship dies with me,
so I get embarrassed.
Look, I'm not here to kill you, pal,
I'm here to tell you that
Raymond Reddington wants to see you.
Oh, so now the U.S. Government is Reddington's messenger.
Oh, you know how it works.
The American government has deals
with all kinds of scumbags.
Look, I'll tell you how it works.
You're gonna give me your phone.
I'm gonna dial a number.
Okay, cowboy.
I like this one.
Reddington?
Manuel Esteban.
My heavens, you're a devil to get ahold of.
I'm surprised we've never met.
I'd like to have a little chitchat.
How would you feel about a blind date?
I'm looking for a woman.
Aren't we all?
Her name is Elizabeth Keen,
and the man holding her has the protection of the FAR.
They know where she is,
which means you know where she is,
or you could certainly find out.
Why would I help you? You're an anarchist.
Probably.
Maybe more of an opportunist.
And I have the opportunity to help you.
You spent a lifetime bouncing
from one authoritarian regime to the next.
But this is the last stop.
You're a relic.
The détente between America and Cuba
makes you a man without a country.
Sooner or later, both sides will want you dead.
My money's on sooner.
I can take care of myself.
Clicking like a hairless fruit bat is impressive, Manuel,
but you and I both know avoiding a lamppost
is very different from avoiding an assassin's bullet.
Echo location can't help you with that, but I can.
What do you propose?
I know what it's like to be hunted.
I've protected myself for 30 years.
And I can protect you...
after you locate Elizabeth Keen.
All right, listen to me, please.
The baby -- I can pay you.
Quiet.
Not me. I have a friend.
Whatever you want, he'll help you.
We'll get you off the island, he'll protect you.
I said quiet, man.
Look, just let her go!
All right, you can kill me. I don't care.
Just let my baby go.
Let's go and dig.
I know you don't want to talk to me. Fine.
Then listen.
It was excruciating
to watch you mourn Elizabeth's death,
to know that I was making you endure that.
Yes, I betrayed you,
but only after you had betrayed her.
Raymond, you have to change.
I took Elizabeth from you,
and now I need your help to get her back.
But when you do,
as I'm sure you will,
you have to let her go.
Why don't you wait in the car?
I have a location for the girl.
And the child?
I asked, but people know nothing about a child.
Tell me about the location.
It is heavily protected.
20, maybe more.
I'll need more men.
That won't be necessary.
I have a blood disorder.
Good.
I'm dying.
Even better.
They're here.
Oh, baby. Are you okay, sweetheart?
Let me look at you.
Oh, you're okay.
Oh, my God.
It's okay. You're a strong girl.
Everything's gonna be okay. You're with Mommy now. Shh.
She's beautiful.
Yes? Yes, it's good to hear from you.
You disappoint me, Balzan.
Yes, yes, of...course.
It's the pilot.
Everything is on schedule. I'll notify the men.
I assume the husband's been taken care of.
Is it done?
What's taking so long?
Angel.
Angel?
Angel.
He wants to talk to you.
Hello. Who's this?
All that matters is that you have a little girl,
and you have her mother.
Tom.
I'm coming for them,
for you.
And not just me, an army.
You hear me?
An army is coming for you.
You lost Tom.
We'll be going soon.
Where?
Home.
I'm not going anywhere with you.
I faked my death to have a normal life.
There's nothing normal about being held prisoner.
A temporary inconvenience.
You'll see in time that the normal life you want,
I'm the only one who can give that to you.
She's hungry, which means I need to feed her,
which means you need to leave.
Of course.
I've done what I can, but you must hurry.
Kirk has chartered a float plane.
There isn't much time.
For either of us.
A stevedore will meet you on Pier 36.
I've arranged for a berth
on a container ship bound for Caracas.
Adios.
We have an ETA on that plane?
Your job here is done, Donald.
Like hell it is.
I came here to get Keen. I'm not leaving without her.
You think I'm gonna let you tag along so you can inform
the people who kidnapped Elizabeth
they have the right to remain silent?
I appreciate your assistance,
but I'm not interested in having an ethical debate with you
about whether they have the right to consult
with an attorney before I put a bullet in their head.
Excuse me.
What about that dirtball? I suppose you think, uh,
I should be okay with letting him walk.
It's entirely up to you.
You made a deal with him.
Yes, in order to save Elizabeth,
I made a deal with the devil of the day.
I did. You didn't.
If you have a problem with that,
you've got 12 hours before his ship leaves
to do something about it.
Otherwise, safe travels home, Donald.
Elizabeth?
Ready to go?
Balzan!
Balzan!
He's gone. Your guards, your security, they're all gone.
The child and the girl -- find them.
This is Agent Mojtabi.
Aram, it's Tom.
Tom? Hey. Tell me you're with Agent Keen.
The man who took Agnes --
he's driving a blue Dodge Sedan, late '50s.
He's taking her straight to Liz.
If we can follow the car...
We can find them. Okay, let me think. Let me think.
Okay, what I'm thinking is, um,
did you help Agent Keen fake her death?
Aram!
Not helpful, I know. Okay. But did you?
At the funeral, when you put a flower on her casket --
The car -- it has an old tube radio.
Local oscillator.
The oscillator. Right. Of course.
Okay, if you could rewire it,
you might be able to turn the PLL receiver into this --
Into a low power mono FM transmitter
that produces a signal that you can trace. Yeah. I know.
You do? Then, uh, why are you...
To get you to trace the signal, Aram.
Oh. Oh, you already... uh...
Wow, that's, uh, that is impressive.
Okay. Hang on. I'm on it.
Thank you.
Did you know?
At the christening,
when you made me a godfather to Agnes --
Look, man, I know you're upset, all right?
But right now is not the time.
I'm trying to ping the signal. Waiting for a reply...
from both of you.
Aram...
Of course I knew.
I'll let you know when, uh, I find the signal.
Thank you.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh. Shh.
Please, Agnes, stop crying. Mommy's here.
Shh, shh, shh.
Think about what you're doing.
What are you gonna do? Hurt me?
Hurt my baby?
Kirk will kill you if you do.
Are you a mother? Do you have children?
Look at her...
No!
Little mama, you got spirit.
Get up. Get the baby.
You'll learn to trust me.
Get the baby and the things. We're leaving.
Like hell we are.
No!
I wish there was another way, I do,
but Reddington's on his way.
Agnes!
Come on. Get her onboard.
Yeah.
Mr. Reddington. It's Aram.
It's not a good time.
I have information on Agent Keen. A location.
She's being held near this --
A small fishing port in Playa Larga.
We're on our way.
Magic. How'd you do that?
We'll have Elizabeth shortly.
And Agnes.
Agnes?
Right. Tom called.
Thanks to him, I was able to track the vehicle
where he had last seen Agnes, a blue Dodge sedan.
Thank you, Aram.
Agnes is here.
Luis, you and your men take
the perimeters to the north and the west.
Dembe, secure the house.
Silvio, you're with me to the south.
You stay put.
That's not your child.
They're gone.
I'm sorry, Raymond.
We have her.
You told them he worked for us?
Do you have any idea
what kind of blowback I'm dealing with here?
And it doesn't take long to find out who told the Cubans.
I heard it was an anonymous tip.
Agent Ressler...
are you a traitor or -- or just a moron?
Look, the agency was gonna assassinate Esteban...
I have no direct knowledge --
So the Cubans wouldn't find out
who was feeding secrets to the CIA.
Whoever this anonymous source is,
he just saved a lot of lives.
What are you talking about?
Now that America knows about
Esteban's little torture chamber,
the Cubans are going to want plausible deniability.
Let's not mince words.
You took it upon yourself to tell the Cubans about our --
No, I took it upon myself to stop what Esteban was doing.
Do you have any idea what that was?
No, of course you don't,
because all you care about is what Esteban was doing for you
There are bigger issues, Agent Ressler.
Torture, abuse, murder.
I don't see any bigger issues than that.
Excuse me.
Have you heard from Reddington?
No.
Uh, last time I spoke to him,
he was on his way to the location
where Agent Keen was being held.
I'm sure he'll call. I'm sure they're okay.
I think you were wrong not going to Cuba.
I'm not saying what Agent Keen did was right,
but as long as her life is in danger,
as long as Agnes's life is in danger,
I think we have to put our feelings aside.
What's happening to Liz is her own fault.
I know that sounds harsh, but it's true.
She made decisions that have consequences,
and now she has to live with them.
She's in trouble.
I know, and I'm angry about that.
Because if she'd behaved differently,
she wouldn't be in this position.
But she is. And no matter how we feel,
I think we have to do something about it.
I don't.
If you don't help,
and something happens to Agent Keen or Agnes,
I know you.
You won't be able to live with yourself.
Yes?
It's Tom.
Tell him we were too late.
Kirk has Elizabeth.
What about Agnes?
She's with us. Safe.
Your daughter is safe.
Raymond, I've been thinking about where we go from here --
