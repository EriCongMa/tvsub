until 10 : 00 , when quiet hours are strictly enforced .
but before then we rage . for three hours .

i had a crush on him .
principal foster says that administrators can &apos;t date teachers .

it &apos;s not just about principal foster .
this is about how i worked
really hard to get to vice principal ,
and i &apos;m not gonna let some british guy get in my way .
some redcoat bastard .
that &apos;s why i keep all
of our interactions strictly professional .

you . the talker .
mmm ... stand up .

there were other people talking ,
i just want to let you know that .
why are you a teacher ?

teaching is an awesome
responsibility .
you are not prepared for it . sit down .

about our fellow educators ,
their hopes , their dreams ,
their bitter regrets .
the things they wish they &apos;d said to their birth mother ...

we just came to say we &apos;re sorry .
guess you think i &apos;m pretty dim , huh ?
a man who can &apos;t do laundry .
you weren &apos;t born this way , were you ?
born not knowing how to do laundry ?
like everyone else ?
yes , winston , i was . it wasn &apos;t till after birth
that the trouble really began .
here we go .
nana wouldn &apos;t let me in the laundry room .
i think it &apos;s because my hands were alwas covered in butter .
and so i went to college unable to do laundry .
i &apos;m making jean shorts !
i &apos;m doing laundry !
big night for both of us !
yeah , it is .
as i pulled out my maternity corduroys ,
i spied a six @-@ pack of pi @-@ phis .
i need ... um ...
i need them loose to keep ...
to keep my sperm count up .
you know how it is !
eventually , the window of time when it was acceptable
to learn something so basic had closed .
i was an adult .
it was too late .
well , i understand .
you know , i &apos;ve never told anyone this ,
but , um ...
i don &apos;t know how to read a ruler .
i don &apos;t , i mean , how do you start ?
at the edge or the first tick ?
it &apos;s confusing to me .
are you serious ?
do you know how to count ?
it always gets on top of me ,
and i can &apos;t ...
&apos;cause then you should know how to use a ruler , you idiot !
i &apos;m an idiot ? you can &apos;t even wash your own underwear ,
you dumbass .
hey ! they &apos;re both super easy !
we &apos;re talking about laundry and a ruler !
i &apos;m gonna teach you guys right now !
let &apos;s go .
each of you holds a stack of cards
with questions for your partners .
you must uncover the answers . begin .
what gets you out of bed in the morning ?
let me guess .
your mother , who you live with , says ,
&quot; ryan , your crumpets are getting cold . &quot;
the thought that any ordinary day could be
the day i look back on when i &apos;m much older
as being the best day of my life .
you ?
same .
don &apos;t look away .
embrace the intimacy ...
i &apos;m good .
embrace the intimacy .
okay .
you know , i think there &apos;s an art to a picnic basket .
apricot jam would never go with a sesame cracker .
of course it wouldn &apos;t , it would go with
a flaky baguette .
duck , duck . okay , now step forward , step forward ,
another step forward ; okay , go to your right , go to your right .
do you scrapbook ?
on rainy days .
step forward , go to your left ; left , left .
big step , that &apos;s it , big step ; now come to me ,
another big step ; come to me .
do you own yarn ?
spools of it .
i craft so much .
it &apos;s a left , and again come to me , come to me .
yes . come to me .
it &apos;s okay , i &apos;ve got you .
we have a new record .
he &apos;s amazing .
i think he might be an angel
sent down to earth like denzel washington
in the preacher &apos;s wife .
oh , honey , okay , what can i do ?
in your purse ,
you will find a white envelope .
okay , you , you wrote a letter to yourself ,
and stuck it in my purse ?
read it , i need to hear it .
&quot; dear jess ,
if you are reading this ,
it &apos;s because you &apos;re being an idiot
and developing feelings for your employee ,
you ballet @-@ flat @-@ wearing piece of oregon trash . &quot;
you are so right .
you are so right .
&quot; to have intercourse with the first man
hired under your reign
would be an insult to yourself and also ... &quot;
this part &apos;s in caps .
... &quot; all women everywhere . &quot;
&quot; did you learn nothing from the movie elizabeth ,
you stupid little bitch ? &quot;
no one respects a queen who sleeps with her subjects .
i will paint my face white .
no man may have me .
thank you , cece .
you &apos;re welcome ?
teaching is such a pain in the ass .
isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;ll tell you what ,
i wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything .
you get to really impact those kids &apos; lives .
i &apos;m not gonna impact them , i &apos;m just teaching health .
&quot; just health &quot; ?
hey , carol .
hey , ned .
oh , it &apos;s carol .
oh , hey , carol .
health is the most important subject .
screw up , and they &quot; just &quot; get pregnant .
what &apos;s your safe sex lesson plan ?
i don &apos;t know !
uh , lie to them and say condoms feel good ?
uh , maybe tell them about my buddy
who &apos;s got bumps on his thing ?
maybe bring up magic johnson .
maybe bring up kobe bryant .
you &apos;re my best friend in the whole world ,
but i &apos;m really worried about you .
you think the line is a suggestion ?
i don &apos;t know what it is ...
it isn &apos;t !
do it again .
it &apos;s too hard !
do it again !
okay , so you start with the first tick .
that &apos;s it , really .
stop !
that was at the line !
that was perfect .
now do it ten more times .
so in the beginning , you never mind the edge .
yeah .
man .
you got to hold on to it .
what about bleach ?
let &apos;s walk before we can run , huh , pal ?
hey , winston , he &apos;s asking about bleach !

it &apos;s a terribly important job .
yeah , but health is the most ...
i &apos;m good .
health is the most important
subject on earth .
yes , it is important .
&apos;cause you know kids ,
they &apos;re always wanting to have sex with each other .
they don &apos;t know that it just feels good for a second
and then you &apos;re sad .
and that &apos;s why we need someone great ,
someone strong , who the kids trust .
okay .
someone who can yell at them
about chlamydia .
that does ... that sounds like ...
like something coach would do .
you can teach .
i can teach , guys !
that &apos;s mostly what i was trying to tell you .
no one needs to worry about me anymore !

winston &apos;s the silly one ,
coach is the sports one , and you &apos;re the cute one .
well , if i were so cute ,
then how come i can &apos;t find anyone to love ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re aiming too low .
nick , my man , you don &apos;t find diamonds underground .
that &apos;s exactly where you find diamonds , winston .
let &apos;s ... can we not ...
this is not about gems , okay ?
this is about nick valuing himself
enough to aim for the top .
now , i @-@ i &apos;ve been to the top of the mountain , with cece ,
and it was glorious up there .
and you know , one of these days-- could be tomorrow--
i &apos;m gonna be a millionaire .

if i &apos;m being honest , you guys , uh ...
i &apos;m worried about being a cop .
sure .
you know , what if i see something
really bad and then it ...
it changes me ?
you know , it makes me lose my faith
and then i become really bad ?
you guys really think i &apos;m the cute one ?
you know what &apos;s not cute ?
pretending that you don &apos;t know that you are .

well , it &apos;s more common than you might think .

if you could strike them from the record .
it was the conference talking , not me .
consider them struck .
thank you .
enjoy your thanksgiving vacation .
it &apos;s , uh , an american holiday
where we celebrate the fact that we ...
didn &apos;t know how to farm by ourselves .
are you curious to know
how i really feel about you ?
no .
because if you were interested ,
i &apos;d tell you that i won &apos;t enjoy my thanksgiving
because i won &apos;t get to see you every day .
i think you &apos;re beautiful
and totally insane ,
and when i &apos;m at work ,
i can &apos;t focus ,
because i can &apos;t get you out of my head .
