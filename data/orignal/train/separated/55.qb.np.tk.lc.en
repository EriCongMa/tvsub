ok .
this will mostly be about ... sex .
and i need to know
if that &apos;ll make anybody uncomfortable .
and it &apos;s okay if it does .
believe me , this stuff makes me feel wiggly .
that &apos;s what my mom used to call it : wiggly @-@ toes .
this is a simple matter of contract law .
i &apos;m sorry to refute the sexual tease of my opposing counsel ,
but really what i need to know is : can you judge my client ,
an independent business owner , fairly ?
sex outside of marriage ...
sex with more than one person ...
sexual bondage ...
i &apos;m sorry . i just ... i keep imagining
my parents listening to this .
sure , i could be fair .
we business people all struggle with the same things more or less .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s sex or office supplies .
accepted .
if her business were dedicated to illegal or illicit activity ,
would that change your mind ?
like what , prostitution ?
no .
her web site , sideencounters.com ,
is dedicated to connecting spouses who want to cheat .
well , i know my wife won &apos;t approve ,
but ... everybody has to make a living .
i &apos;m sorry , your honor ,
i &apos;d like to challenge this juror for cause .
there &apos;s no reason for cause , your honor ...
he &apos;s already stated his opinion , he &apos;s bias ...
no , no , no , i am not going to let this trial get out of hand .
i &apos;ll allow mrs. crozier &apos;s challenge for cause .
it &apos;s &quot; miss &quot; crozier .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
miss ?
it &apos;s all right .
i am looking , if that &apos;s any consolation .
uh , anyway ...
i would agree with mr. gardner ,
you &apos;re both arguing your case through voir dire ,
which i strenuously disapprove of .
and your honor , i &apos;d like to use , um , sexual images
from the web site in trial .
come on , your honor .
she &apos;s turning this into a lawsuit about sex .
oop , maybe it &apos;s just me , but this is a lawsuit about sex .
no , the husband of your client used my client &apos;s web site
to arrange a date , and wound up dead . that &apos;s all .
could &apos;ve been a web site about antiquing .
but it wasn &apos;t .
it was about infidelity .
your honor , then we would likewise like to introduce
the police murder investigation into evidence .
that investigation was inconclusive .
and how do we have access to this ?
30 @-@ year @-@ old sean briglio .
found in room 606 of the st. martin hotel .
handcuffed . ball gag in his mouth .
and his penis severed from his body .
yes , it &apos;s making me wince even just talking about it .
the ... severed member was found in the ice bucket .
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
on ice with the champagne .
there &apos;s probably a joke to be made about shrinkage ,
but i won &apos;t go there .
i think you just did .
the date he arranged on your client &apos;s lovely web site ,
was with a &quot; cynthia r. &quot;
okay .
that &apos;s a made @-@ up name .
and her handle was &quot; prettispecial9 . &quot;
traced that ip address to a copycrater in winnetka .
trail ran cold there .
checked his other earlier dates .
all had alibis .
it &apos;s still an open investigation .
like jimmy hoffa , huh ?
i would imagine if jimmy hoffa &apos;s penis was found
in a hotel ice bucket ,
chicago &apos;s finest would be looking just as hard for his killer .
but we are trying to connect
this homicide to another female suspect in texas .
also a castrator .
thanks , cary . always a pleasure .
i &apos;m staying put .
you &apos;re staying put ?
where ?
here .
oh , peter florrick wants you ?
yeah , isn &apos;t that odd ? i would &apos;ve thought
my competition with his wife would &apos;ve made me persona non grata .
yeah , i would &apos;ve thought so , too .
he doesn &apos;t seem to care
that alicia and i aren &apos;t on the best of terms .
read into that what you will .
okay .
this is a monastery , alicia .
i am a priest .
whatever you tell me does not leave here .
it &apos;s not altruism ; it &apos;s pragmatism .
i only have a practice if i &apos;m discreet .
i am separating from my husband .
these notes are for me . i keep them under lock and key .
so , you &apos;re looking for a divorce lawyer ?
no . uh , we @-@ we &apos;re separating .
but you will divorce ?
i don &apos;t know ... yet .
i haven &apos;t decided yet .
you &apos;re worried about it going public ?
yes .
i want to know how to protect myself .
financially ?
yes . is there anything i should be doing ?
what is your husband &apos;s income over the past two years ?
negligible . i &apos;ve been the supporter .
and he &apos;s one month away from becoming state &apos;s attorney .
that &apos;s $ 220,000 a year .
you &apos;d actually be better off waiting till next year to divorce .
david , let &apos;s forget this .
yeah , what ?
okay .
uh , you &apos;re needed upstairs .
alicia , i don &apos;t know your personal situation .
frankly , i don &apos;t want to know .
my tolerance for mess is minimal .
but i can tell you this : you are like me .
you like plans .
you like lists .
so make a list of your income ,
your expenses and his ,
and all relevant tax returns .
bring it to me , and i &apos;ll make you a list
of everything you need to do to protect yourself . okay ?
within the firm , we can call it
&quot; the cole divorce . &quot;
something i asked you to work on with me .
okay .
thanks .
oh , no . no thanks .
uh , you &apos;re paying me now .
that was one billable hour .
i round up .
well , the bottom line is , it &apos;s a cold case--
a year @-@ old unsolved homicide .
now the police suspect that the victim was picked up
from the sideencounters.com web site ,
but there &apos;s no proof .
so our best defense is to play into that ambiguity .
how can our client &apos;s web site be responsible
if the police haven &apos;t absolutely concluded it &apos;s from her site ?
oh , alicia , good .
we &apos;re going to trial on sideencounters ,
and we need you to take on a more prominent role .
we didn &apos;t get the jury we wanted .
and our client &apos;s product isn &apos;t the most sympathetic .
the opposing attorney is playing up the sex and infidelity angle ,
so we need you to take first chair .
because my husband cheated on me ?
well , yes . it might work on the jurors who recognize you .
you all right with that ?
sure .
they &apos;re going to want to use you as a punching bag ,
so we need to limit your time in court .
also , we need some more sessions of witness prep .
you &apos;re their biggest witness .
they &apos;re going to want to put you on the stand .
&apos;cause i &apos;m unsympathetic .
yes .
and you &apos;re supposed to rub off on me ?
the jury sees you being friendly to me ,
and they think i must be ...
tolerable ?
well , i hope a little more than tolerable ,
but yes .
funny , i think of myself as very sympathetic .
well , you &apos;re not on the jury .
also , we need to talk about your posture towards the widow ,
the woman who &apos;s suing you .
do you feel bad for her ?
i do . i feel bad that her husband &apos;s dead .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s suing me &apos; cause he &apos;s dead ;
i think she &apos;s suing me because he used my web site
to cheat , and for that she blames me .
and you don &apos;t think she should blame you ?
you blame the beer for the dui ?
no , but i might blame the bartender .
i thought you were on my side .
i am on your side .
but the best way to be on your side
is to see how the other side thinks .
that &apos;s what lawyers do .
that &apos;s how i do it .
you know there &apos;s a porn movie about you ?
no , i didn &apos;t know that .
there &apos;s a porn movie about you .
and all the wives standing by their husbands .
it &apos;s a trilogy , actually .
it &apos;s like lord of the rings .
there seems to be a whole subdivision of
erotica devoted to devoted wives .
good to know .
i hope you &apos;re not offended .
men masturbate to the thought of you .
it &apos;s almost an honor when you think of it .
no , even when i think of it , it &apos;s not an honor .
good work .
wait .
alicia , i don &apos;t want to lose my husband
and my kids &apos; money .
how many kids do you have ?
three .
good ! i can build on that .
really ?
one of them has a bucktooth . it &apos;s adorable .
i &apos;ll see you in court .
no , no . no .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
that was cary . this cold case ...
we &apos;re going to stay in touch .
great .
so , what &apos;s up ?
no , kalinda . no .
what ?
we both work here .
we &apos;re both going to continue to work here .
so let &apos;s not talk .
alicia ...
no . you don &apos;t explain anything .
you do not put a single thing in context .
you slept with my husband .
you do not say anything after that . you do not .
it is selfish ... to say anything after that .
i work here and you work here , but that &apos;s it .
when you can find another case , do it .
when you can walk the other way , do .
now get out of my office .
kalinda , there are so many people who can see us right now ,
but i ... swear i will scream at the top of my lungs
if you don &apos;t get out of my office now .
hello , grace .
i thought i &apos;d drop by , and bring your favorite .
i know your mom hasn &apos;t wanted me to help out around here anymore ,
but i don &apos;t think she &apos;ll begrudge my lemon muffins .
hey , grandma .
zach .
h @-@ how have you two been doing ?
good .
yeah , we &apos;re good .
i &apos;ll tell your dad .
he &apos;s ... he &apos;s just so ... torn up .
yeah . mom said he &apos;s in an apartment ?
yes . she moved him there . i ...
i think it &apos;s comfortable , it &apos;s just ...
it &apos;s awful , though , how quick it was .
i didn &apos;t see it coming .
yeah . we &apos;re good , though .
i , i guess i &apos;m still trying to absorb it .
you don &apos;t know what your mom &apos;s thinking , do you ?
she said that they &apos;d give it a try .
it was just too much for them .
i don &apos;t know why they can &apos;t try
and still stay in the same place .
just ... just seems odd .
i think it &apos;s just between mom and dad .
yes , but it &apos;s about you two , too .
i don &apos;t think we should talk about it .
alicia !
nancy !
oh , i &apos;m so thrilled you &apos;ll be digging into this .
we left things so unresolved last time .
i know .
and i felt bad about how that came down ...
came ... ?
what do you mean ?
how i beat you last time .
oh , you &apos;re so funny .
sean and i had this tradition on our anniversary .
we &apos;d break open some champagne ,
and just watch our wedding video .
i know , old @-@ fashioned .
no , it sounds beautiful .
i hate to have to get to this , but ...
when did you first learn that your husband
was having affairs on sideencounters.com ?
when the police came to my house
to tell me sean had been murdered .
if it &apos;s not too hard for you ,
what did they tell you ?
they showed me his profile
on ... her web site .
and ... this was your husband ?
yes .
your honor , at this point
i &apos;d like to show more photos of mr. briglio ,
but i understand that we need to warn the court .
yes , yes , thank you . the images you are about to see
are of a strong sexual nature .
if anyone wants to leave , please feel free to do so .
okay .
these are from your husband &apos;s private gallery on the web site .
and is this him with another woman ?
yes .
and this is him with two women .
did you know who these women were ?
no . they &apos;re people he met through this ...
web site .
and had your husband ever cheated on you
before learning about this web site ?
objection , your honor . hearsay .
yes , um , sustained .
i &apos;m sorry that &apos;s so objectionable .
but you were happy , dana ?
i think it &apos;s all right if i ask that much .
i was .
i &apos;m not saying our marriage was perfect ,
but we always told the truth to each other .
until he found this site .
those pictures are very upsetting . i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
mrs. briglio , who &apos;s gina wiggens ?
my husband didn &apos;t sleep with her .
i know . i &apos;m just wondering who she is .
she &apos;s a coworker of his , at his school .
she was always clinging on him .
didn &apos;t miss wiggens bring a restraining order
against your husband ?
sean was the victim there . she pursued him .
that &apos;s what your husband told you ?
yes , and it &apos;s true .
because your husband always told you the truth
until he found stephanie &apos;s web site ?
yes .
this is a certified copy
of the restraining order against your husband .
have you read it ?
no .
would you like to read it ?
no .
because you trust your husband ?
yes .
i took an oath and i kept it to trust him .
your husband first logged onto
sideencounters in april of 2009 .
can you read when miss wiggens brought
the restraining order against your husband ?
but that doesn &apos;t mean anything .
she &apos;s lying .
french , circa 1660 .
and i start the bidding out at $ 250,000 .
kalinda sharma .
sophia .
almost didn &apos;t recognize you undercover .
so i should &apos;ve known . you &apos;re a big fan of pre @-@ raphelite ?
yeah . i was , uh , looking for some home furnishings .
what are you working ?
i @-@ banker . the first row , last one .
it &apos;s the guy with the girl .
company thinks he &apos;s bidding on blank checks .
really ?
sounds fun .
don &apos;t patronize me .
no , seriously . sounds fun .
wait a minute . i asked you . i asked you to come join me .
i begged you to come join me ,
and you said corporate investigation wasn &apos;t for you .
i changed my mind .
and you said you &apos;d never change your mind .
i was wrong .
take my position .
what &apos;s going on ?
well , i want to try something new .
yeah ? okay , so why not go to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ?
we both have friends still there .
oh , this sounded better .
so i was your second call ?
offended ?
no , confused .
we won &apos;t let you wear what you &apos;re wearing .
it &apos;s a very corporate world .
well , i can adapt .
i &apos;ve just started a new white collar division .
i &apos;m in .
you don &apos;t want to think about it first ?
i just did .
that &apos;s not what i said .
yes , it is .
in your promotional material ,
you are quoted as saying that your web site allows couples
to have affairs without cheating .
yes , but i meant it about biology .
monogamy is unnatural .
it forces the body to do something it &apos;s not meant to do .
be committed ?
no , be monogamous .
have you used your web site ?
have i ? yes .
so you &apos;ve cheated on your husband ?
it &apos;s not cheating . we know exactly where we are ;
we know exactly who we &apos;re dating .
and your husband approves ?
not only does he approve ,
i approve when he wants to date someone .
so if having an affair
keeps a marriage from being based on a lie ,
why do you have a panic button on your web site ?
what ?
why does your web site
have a button that allows the reader
to hide the page to keep anyone looking ?
because you don &apos;t have to share
my philosophy to use my web site .
you give good prep .
i wanna light a cigarette .
not in here .
i was joking .
don &apos;t delve too deeply into
the philosophy of your web site .
you have to offer context , but briefly .
it makes you sound like a crank .
okay .
what ?
i don &apos;t get it .
you don &apos;t get ...
how i can sleep with other people besides my husband ?
yes . i mean , why even get married ?
i love him .
yes ... but what does that have to do in this context ?
it means i want to spend more time with him
than any other man or woman .
i don &apos;t understand the reverse .
how do you have sex with just one man ?
why would you want to do anything--
play cards , go sailing , go fishing , whatever--
with just one person ?
because it would hurt them not to .
yes .
yes , but that &apos;s not about love ; that &apos;s about fear .
that &apos;s about jealousy .
if you love someone , don &apos;t you set them free ?
no .
you like to tie them down ?
yes . basically .
aren &apos;t there men you look at ,
and you just watch them ...
in a starbucks line , opening a door , tying their shoes ...
and you just want to grab their hand
and slide it up the small of your back ?
or feel the touch of someone else &apos;s lips on your skin ?
the taste of someone else &apos;s tongue ?
the pleasure of someone else &apos;s orgasm .
don &apos;t you want that ?
i have to go .
good work .
you look tired .
thanks .
cary . you called ?
did i ?
yeah . an hour ago .
you said it had something to do with sean briglio &apos;s murder .
oh yeah , yeah , no . i just ... i wanted to see
if you had anything for me .
cary ?
just a minute . i &apos;ll be right back .
sure .
i &apos;m away from my phone at the moment ,
so please leave a message .
look , alicia , you need to answer this .
nancy crozier was meeting with cary .
i &apos;m a bit old @-@ fashioned about these things ,
so you &apos;ll have to walk me through this ...
oh , i don &apos;t think you &apos;re that old fashioned .
really ? thank you .
just ... walk me through this .
what is a triad ?
it &apos;s an open marriage among three partners .
i &apos;m just ... a michigan girl .
fresh off the boat .
so ... so , miss engler , let &apos;s turn to the victim now .
mrs. engler .
married six years , so ...
hey , baby .
sorry .
mrs. engler , how did you know the victim , sean briglio ?
how did i know him ? he used my site .
you never met him in person ?
nope .
and ... this credit card charge to the st. martin ,
february 16 , 2010 , who were you meeting then ?
uh ... who was i meeting ?
yeah . um , you made a credit card charge
to the st. martin on the same day that
mr. briglio was meeting one of his &quot; dates . &quot;
objection , your honor .
what does this have to do with the plaintiff &apos;s suit ?
yes , miss crozier , we seem to have run astray here .
well , your honor ,
if mrs. engler met and slept with the victim ,
then this suit has even stronger merit .
your honor , we request a short recess .
but , your honor , i was just getting to the best part .
let &apos;s take a short recess .
i think we can straighten this out . don &apos;t you ?
they just found their murder suspect-- our client .
then , charge her .
if you have something on her , then charge her .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have enough chairs .
my office is so small .
come on , cary . what &apos;s your game ?
i don &apos;t have a game .
it &apos;s the game called prosecuting the bad guys .
you &apos;re feeding this information
to crozier in a civil case against our client .
yes , and i understand
your client lied about not sleeping with him .
sleeping with him isn &apos;t illegal .
you &apos;re right , but killing him would be .
oh , come on .
you think she killed him ?
i think i &apos;m investigating .
and you &apos;re using our civil case to further that investigation ?
well , let &apos;s just say that i &apos;m watching with rapt interest .
next time , call ahead , guys . i &apos;ll have cookies .
you slept with him , stephanie ?
he was into s and m-- it was too hardcore .
i @-@ i told him not to contact me again .
okay . what have you got , kalinda ?
well , as far as i can tell ,
the murder case now has heat .
they were trying to connect briglio &apos;s killer
to a serial castrator in texas .
that &apos;s how they overlooked our client .
okay . our advice has changed , stephanie .
it &apos;s better to starve cary &apos;s investigation of your testimony ,
so with your approval ,
alicia will make a deal on the civil ,
and we &apos;ll turn to defending on the criminal .
what &apos;s going on with your buddy , cary ?
he seems intent on screwing us .
i &apos;m turning in my notice .
yeah , okay .
what &apos;s the bump now ? five percent ?
no , will . i &apos;m turning in my notice .
this is my two weeks .
i &apos;m not getting into a bidding war .
i &apos;m not asking you to .
we &apos;re going to make you head of a department , k.
we &apos;re going to put you in charge of other investigators .
look , will , when you hired me ,
i told you , when i &apos;m done , i &apos;m done .
i &apos;m done .
i need to try something else .
where are you going ?
i &apos;ll help you find my replacement .
um ... not really .
don &apos;t you want to take that offer back to your client ?
no . my client already gave me the acceptable amount .
which is ?
darn it . you almost made me slip .
you have a loser case , nancy .
we &apos;re offering you the insurance limit .
we don &apos;t want the insurance limit .
where do you get your hair done ?
it &apos;s so shiny .
she &apos;s not getting $ 11 million .
i don &apos;t know . this guy at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office ,
he &apos;s been super helpful .
he &apos;s been giving me a few names
that maybe i should add to the witness list .
what ?
grace ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
are ... are you sure ? is zach okay ?
yeah . it &apos;s not anything .
it &apos;s ... mom , i want to talk .
grace , we discussed this .
i know . it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s ... i don &apos;t get it .
we &apos;re separating .
we need to take a breath .
i know other kids at school who are told that ,
and it &apos;s never true .
it &apos;s just something parents tell them to make them feel better .
i love you , grace .
maybe you &apos;re right . i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m hurting .
can &apos;t dad help you with that ?
no .
but dad &apos;s hurting , too .
he doesn &apos;t understand .
dad came by ?
no .
he called ?
grandma told us .
she came over .
i shouldn &apos;t have said .
she told me not to say .
your grandmother ...
grace , listen to me .
your grandmother has issues .
she &apos;s lonely .
she &apos;ll be wanting to come over .
i need you to call me when she does .
promise me you &apos;ll call me .
i &apos;ll call you back .
okay , so let me start .
stop contributing to your retirement fund until this settles .
you have a salary bump coming in two months .
ask to delay it till next year .
make copies of your stock options .
keep them here at the office .
they have a tendency to go missing if we start proceedings .
talk to me about custody .
is it that serious ?
i want to know my options
if i do something to make it that serious .
okay .
uh , your children are both teenagers
and have a good deal of say in which parent to live with .
more than you might think .
do not become the difficult parent .
and you should document how much time you spend
with the kids , how little time he does .
and when i say &quot; document &quot; &quot; i mean a journal .
what effect does a grandparent &apos;s involvement have with that ?
determining parental involvement ? none .
it &apos;s all down to the parents .
alicia ...
delay this fight .
it &apos;s not a fight .
then delay this .
he means more to you in the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office
than out-- on all levels .
i &apos;m speaking purely pragmatically
and , oddly , selflessly .
thank you .
i &apos;m needed in court .
and you were working as a valet the night of the murder ?
yes . it was awful .
people screaming .
and you saw ... this car--
stephanie &apos;s car--
the night of the murder ?
yes , that car .
i saw it peeling out of the parking lot .
my goodness .
why didn &apos;t you tell the police before ?
well , it &apos;s only recently they brought me this picture .
hmm , well , thank goodness it jogged your memory .
why are you here and not helping
the police arrest my client ?
i have no idea .
let &apos;s see .
i &apos;ve worked at the copycrater for two years now .
i &apos;m good with people .
and you knew her as a customer ?
uh , yeah , she uses the computers sometimes .
and these are the computers that the killer--
prettispecial9--
used to write her e @-@ mails ?
this is where the police traced the , um ...
what is it called ?
ip address ?
yes .
oh , yeah .
it &apos;s our little brush with fame .
but you didn &apos;t see stephanie there
at copycrater on the actual day ?
the day the e @-@ mail was sent ? no .
all i can tell you is that she &apos;s a customer .
that &apos;s all .
the carpet fibers found at the crime scene--
they are from a socala tweed stitch carpet .
and the defendant owns this carpet ?
yes .
and yet i &apos;m still baffled why you &apos;re here , detective ,
and not at some murder trial .
can you answer that ?
i can &apos;t .
all i can say is that the plaintiff subpoenaed me .
we need another suspect .
see what you can do .
even the whiff of another suspect will help .
got it .
god , this pisses me off .
do you think she did it ?
stephanie ? i don &apos;t know .
doesn &apos;t matter if she did .
this lawsuit &apos;s still bogus .
a photo i took earlier in front of the courthouse .
a gray metallic audi .
now here &apos;s stephanie &apos;s car , the photo used in court .
it &apos;s what the valet testified
looked like the car he saw racing off
on the night of the murder .
now , they don &apos;t look much the same , do they ?
until you put it at the scene
and put it under the same fluorescent lighting .
who &apos;s this car belong to ?
the widow .
dana briglio .
you can point to her as the killer .
you can &apos;t be leaving me , kalinda .
you &apos;re too good at this .
it &apos;s time to move on .
what are you , a dylan song ?
you said you had my back .
what do you want from life , will ?
what do i want ?
i don &apos;t know .
suddenly , this is about me ?
you want the same things as alicia ?
alicia ? i ...
i don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a vast difference between us .
because she &apos;s married ?
yeah , for one .
and she has kids ,
and i ...
what are we talking about here ?
she separated from her husband .
what ?
alicia--
she separated from peter .
it &apos;s not ...
there are too many issues .
i know . there always are .
why ?
why &apos;d they separate ?
it &apos;s not public knowledge , so don &apos;t tell her i told you .
i &apos;m not going to tell her anything .
you know best .
full confession ...
at one point early in the race ,
i actually thought peter might lose .
excuse me .
sorry to interrupt .
alicia , hello . what a surprise .
do you have a moment ?
i do .
i know you &apos;ve heard me talk about her quite a bit ,
but allow me to introduce ...
alicia , this really is a surprise .
from now on , jackie , when you want to come to my home ,
you will call me .
if you can &apos;t get me , call my assistant .
if you can &apos;t get her , try again .
why are you so upset , alicia ?
jackie , do you hear my voice ?
do i sound upset ?
no , but these words are so hostile .
the next time you try to turn my children against me ,
i will keep them permanently off @-@ limits to you .
i didn &apos;t try anything .
i ... i @-@ i tried to explain ,
because no one else is explaining .
jackie , i have come to understand
that you need to hear things two times to absorb them ,
so the next time you try to turn my children against me ...
so disrespectful . i watched over them .
yes , and thank you .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m not cutting them off immediately .
they &apos;re peter &apos;s children , too .
yes , but they &apos;re not yours .
he &apos;ll get custody .
that &apos;s unlikely .
he &apos;s the state &apos;s attorney .
who banged a hooker 18 times .
let &apos;s see where that ends up .
oh , my god , you &apos;re awful .
you don &apos;t know the half of it .
the next time you want to see your grandchildren , you call first .
i know what happened in your house .
i was your housekeeper , you know .
i have no idea what that means , jackie .
yep , like i said ,
that &apos;s the car i saw skidding off .
you saw this at st. martin ?
yes .
but this is dana briglio &apos;s car .
excuse me .
objection , your honor .
okay . on what grounds ?
relevance .
what are they suggesting ,
that mrs. briglio killed her own husband ?
yes , that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re suggesting .
thank you , miss crozier .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
no more ridiculous than suggesting our client did it .
i think i have to overrule that , miss crozier .
you introduced the car evidence ;
they should be allowed the opportunity to refute it .
thank you , your honor .
but isn &apos;t the socala tweed stitch carpet fiber
one of the most common types in north america ?
that &apos;s true .
and have you tested all of the carpets belonging to mrs. briglio ?
all of them ? no .
do you think you should ?
nope , i don &apos;t recognize her .
you &apos;re sure ?
she lives just as close to your shop
as my client stephanie engler .
well , i don &apos;t see everybody who comes in .
good job . really good job .
i loved seeing nancy crozier &apos;s face .
yeah . thanks .
how are you ?
is everything good ?
everything &apos;s good .
you ?
yeah , i guess . you know .
if you ever want to talk ...
sure .
good .
i &apos;m here .
oh , kalinda , good .
i want you to prep alicia for the questioning
of dana tomorrow . thanks .
okay , um , i &apos;m still tracing down prettispecial9 &apos;s avatar .
it , it seems to be part of a bigger picture ;
possibly two overlapping drawings .
um , still haven &apos;t found a match .
do you want me to get somebody else to brief you ?
you mean someone who hasn &apos;t slept with my husband ?
yes , you &apos;re in pain , alicia .
i hurt you . now do you want to know the facts ?
of what ?
i slept with him once .
now , i do that .
it means nothing to me ,
but i do that .
look , alicia , i didn &apos;t know you .
i &apos;d never even seen a picture of you .
to me , you were just a housewife .
then i met you , and i liked you .
i liked working with you .
i liked talking with you .
i felt bad .
i don &apos;t like feeling bad .
every step of the way you just looked at me .
and you knew ?
yes .
and i &apos;m an idiot . i never once thought
that you were my friend out of some guilt .
out of some guilty welfare for poor little me .
that &apos;s not why .
i don &apos;t have friends , alicia .
you were a friend .
and you lied to me .
you said , &quot; that &apos;s not true &quot; about being with him .
yes .
i &apos;m sorry .
oh . okay . thanks .
now that we &apos;ve cleared that up ...
i &apos;m not explaining to justify ...
how was my husband ? was he good ?
i &apos;m ... i found another job , and i &apos;m leaving next week .
good .
get out !
what ?
we &apos;re still confirming , but ...
we think your husband is prettispecial9 .
we think he was the one who wrote to sean briglio ,
and arranged that last ... date .
and we just think you should be forewarned .
but i ... ?
what ?
our investigator thinks it probably was your car
skidding away from the st. martin on the night of the murder ,
but your husband was driving it .
and the carpet fibers , we think , are yours .
from your house , but your husband tracked them there .
and our investigator showed your husband &apos;s photo
to the copycrater employee ,
and he identified him as being a customer .
you &apos;re our client , stephanie . alec isn &apos;t .
and that &apos;s , that &apos;s why we wanted to tell you .
but why ?
why did he do it ?
yes .
he was jealous .
yes , the violence of the crime scene ,
the castration , would suggest some passionate emotion .
he was jealous ?
yes .
did you talk to him about sleeping with the victim ?
yeah , but i ...
i didn &apos;t think he cared .
so , mrs. engler , as your lawyers ,
we would advise you to create some distance
between yourself and your husband .
it &apos;s legally smart ,
but also , it might be safer .
either way , we &apos;re in a sticky situation with the lawsuit .
the plaintiff can now more clearly show culpability .
stephanie ?
okay , that didn &apos;t go the way i thought .
she &apos;s in love .
all right , negotiate with crozier .
let &apos;s try to keep her liability to a minimum .
she &apos;s gonna need it for a good defense lawyer .
you clearly got will gardner &apos;s attention .
he asked me how much i offered you .
and i figure this is when you tell me you &apos;re staying put .
that was your plan , right ?
to get his bid up .
you think i &apos;ve been using you ?
i think it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .
hey , my case is done .
i can start monday .
okay .
you &apos;ll have to hit the ground sprinting .
you &apos;re going to be going back to the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
yeah , we closed a deal to handle their investigative work .
it &apos;s easier on their budget to contract out .
i want you to be my top dog over there .
okay . i guess that &apos;s funny .
with peter florrick ?
yes , he &apos;s the new state &apos;s attorney .
he &apos;s bringing everyone back .
i &apos;m staying .
good . i need you on the judge murder .
so , what was that ,
your little three @-@ day walkabout ?
i wanted to leave . now i don &apos;t .
you want me to stay ?
i do .
okay .
is this about alicia ?
is what about alicia ?
you leaving .
i &apos;m not leaving .
at some point ,
kalinda , you &apos;re going to have to confide in someone .
no , i don &apos;t .
you know what i discovered ?
i never have to confide in anyone .
the only client harder to represent
than a cop @-@ killer is a judge @-@ killer .
and forget the adjective &quot; alleged . &quot;
everyone thinks our client did it .
this judge was a beloved figure .
which means we &apos;re the bad guys , so don &apos;t expect
any help from outside these offices .
this is a high @-@ profile , heavy @-@ coverage trial ,
and childs is going to want to make it his swan song .
so i want everyone to put his or her life
