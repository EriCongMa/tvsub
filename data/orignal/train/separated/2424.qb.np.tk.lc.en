i &apos;m elena .
i &apos;m stefan .
love brought me to mystic falls ,
love drove me away .
i am not sorry that i &apos;m in love with you , damon .
phasmatos , raverus un animun .
we &apos;ve all made sacrifices .
bonnie , what did you do ?
i did a spell that brought you back .
you can see ghosts . we can talk .
no ! you can &apos;t be dead !
party at whitmore house tonight .
and even though we &apos;re tring to move on .
i love college .
hey ! who are you ?
i &apos;m megan , your roommate .
help me !
oh , my god !
this was a vampire .
new enemies have emerged ...
nadia ?
jaryakat a zem .
just as our greatest threat ...
silas .
hello , my shadow self .
is finally making his move .
where &apos;s stefan ?
bring me katherine , and then i will tell you
where your little brother is .
you can &apos;t take me back there , jeremy .
you all know elena gilbert .
well , the girl that i &apos;m looking for
looks exactly like her .
it was supposed to be a nice family event .
just stopped in to see my dad .
then silas showed up .
he said he was testing how powerful
his mind control had become .
nobody make a sound or move a muscle .
the entire town did exactly what he said .
he didn &apos;t want any witnesses ,
so he told them to forget what he did .
they watched my dad die ,
and they couldn &apos;t do anything
or tell anyone .
what are you gonna do ?
you gonna hug me ?
i want to .
but you can &apos;t .
you can &apos;t touch me ,
and i can &apos;t touch you because i &apos;m dead ,
just like my dad except he &apos;s not supernatural ,
so i don &apos;t get to see him on the other side .
he &apos;s just dead .
silas is using his mind control to find katherine .
he told everyone in the town square to keep an eye out
for anyone that looks like elena .
whatever he wants with katherine ...
we can &apos;t let him have it .
you ok , hon ?
you &apos;re gonna get yourself sick out here .
thank you so much for stopping .
you look just like elena gilbert .
actually , i &apos;m much prettier .
katherine pierce , right ?
i &apos;m supposed to be keeping my eye out for you .
damn it ! unh !
hurts , doesn &apos;t it ?
not as much as this will .
we could be doing anything right now , stefan ,
be anywhere .
why here , why this ?
these are the good moments ,
the simple ones , the ones that matter .
these are the moments that keep me from falling apart .
this can &apos;t last forever .
you &apos;re just distracting yourself .
elena , elena , elena .
elena !
no .
megan &apos;s memorial outside is growing by the minute .
ugh . college kids are so dramatic .
she was on campus for , like , one day .
she couldn &apos;t have made that many friends .
caroline , she &apos;s dead .
you can stop competing with her .
sorry . i &apos;m in a mood .
you talked to tyler ?
he &apos;s deferring from enrolling
and deferring from returning my phone calls ,
so i &apos;m deferring from having sex with him ever again .
how &apos;s the snooping going ?
any explanation why our vervain @-@ laced ...
vampire @-@ slaughtered roommate
had a picture of my dad on her phone ?
no .
oh ! i went by the hospital this morning .
megan &apos;s death certificate .
it says she died of suicide .
no mention of the gaping vampire bites on her neck .
so whoever signed off on the cause of death
was part of the cover @-@ up
just like the founders council back home .
dr. wesley maxfield .
aka our applied microbiology t.a.
i switched our classes around so that we can--
applied what--what ?
uh , elena , we are supposed to be taking
intro to communication .
what happened to getting drunk
and making bad decisions about boys ?
what happened to our fun freshman year at college ?
i am supposed to be a drama major !
you &apos;re not going to be an anything major
if we get exposed as vampires !
we are still gonna have our fun year , caroline ,
but we have to protect ourselves .
the way damon kept his secret in mystic falls
was because he infiltrated the founders council .
so bust out those alleged acting skills ,
and let &apos;s get on it , ok ?
damon , i know i said i &apos;d help you find your brother ,
but i can &apos;t dredge the entire quarry .
it &apos;s enormous .
i &apos;m aware of that .
i mean , clearly that &apos;s why we wanted to dump
silas &apos; body here beuse it &apos;s big and deep
and no one would find him .
now say i &apos;m silas
and i want to take over my doppelganger &apos;s life ,
why wouldn &apos;t i dump him in a place
that &apos;s big and deep where no one would find him ?
damon , i already agreed to hold off on telling anyone
about the mayor &apos;s death until you figure this all out ,
but i can &apos;t devote those kinds of resources
to finding one person who may or may not be down there .
but it &apos;s a place to start ,
and if stefan &apos;s down there ,
it means he &apos;s been drowning over and over again all summer
while i &apos;ve been happily playing house with elena .
do i need to further elaborate
the source of my urgency ?
i &apos;ll get some deputies on it .
thank you , liz .
please tell me you found her .
i didn &apos;t , but matt did .
huh . how shockingly useful .
those blue eyes , they made me soft .
i should have ripped your head off when i had the chance .
she was mid cat fight with some lady who maced her .
we think silas might have
mind @-@ controlled himself some new friends .
how exactly did the gilbert and donovan
brain trust put all that together ?
never mind . doesn &apos;t matter .
just hide her . if silas wants her bad enough ,
to sic the whole town on her ,
that means we want her more .
stay out of sight .
you &apos;re the last person silas saw her with .
are these ropes really necessary ?
bullet would have been more effective ,
but we &apos;re trying to be nice .
you crashed my car and left me to die .
you were gonna hand me over to silas to get stefan back .
i was just protecting myself .
how many people you killed using that excuse ?
just be glad we got you some clothes .
don &apos;t play the hero .
you two aro just waiting for the convenient time
to hand me back over to him .
i &apos;ve done this a thousand times .
i get it . i &apos;m the leverage .
i &apos;m that thing that everybody wants .
i &apos;m the freaking moonstone .
hey . blow @-@ off girl .
aren &apos;t you a freshman ?
how are you in this class ?
what ? um , i love applied ... micro ... biology .
it &apos;s like my favorite biology .
you know , little things are just so cute !
are you going to the bonfire tonight ,
or are you just gonna get really close
and then turn around and leave again ?
she &apos;ll be there .
sweet .
we &apos;ll hang .
what ? you said you wanted to make
bad decisions about boys .
he &apos;s cute , he &apos;s interested ,
and most importantly , unlike tyler , he &apos;s here .
morning , everyone .
i &apos;m dr. maxfield . first name is wes ,
but call me dr. maxfield .
one day when you &apos;re out of med school ,
you &apos;ll understand .
so you &apos;re all going to this bonfire tonight , right ?
well , here &apos;s a quick history lesson for you .
whitmore was founded as a hospital during the civil war ,
deadliest war in american history ,
over 600,000 casualties .
disease was so prevalent that once a week
they had to gather all the dead ,
rotting bodies , put them in a pile ,
and light the whole thing on fire .
so tonight when you &apos;re getting drunk and partying ,
stop for a second , close your eyes ,
and imagine the rancid smell of a hundred rotting corpses .
creep @-@ y .
which brings us to microbiology ...
but hott @-@ ie .
because that rancid smell comes from a very specific bacteria .
he is .
isn &apos;t that right , chatty girls in the back ?
and what is that bacteria ?
uh , that &apos;s the , uh-- um , i don &apos;t know .
maybe because you &apos;re freshmen who shouldn &apos;t be in this class .
how do i know ? i &apos;m observant ,
a skill you &apos;ll learn in bio 101 down the hall .
it was mortifying .
we just sat there in silence .
you want me to beat him up ?
not yet . whatever he knows ,
i &apos;m gonna get it out of him .
did you compel him ?
no , because chances are if he knows about vampires ,
then he also knows about vervain .
how about violence ? did you threaten him ?
no . i didn &apos;t threaten him .
at least tell me you used torture .
damon !
you do realize that you are dating
a reformed serial killer , right ?
what would a hero do ?
that i have no idea .
stefan ?
i don &apos;t know . probably mope at him .
stefan &apos;s here right now .
what ?
turn off your phone .
elena ? that is not s--
i know you &apos;re upset that i didn &apos;t call ,
so i just wanted to apologize in person .
never do that again , ok ?
i thought something terrible happened to you .
well , something terrible did happen to me .
you fell in love with my brother .
can &apos;t blame me for needing a little bit of space .
i know .
where did you go ?
it &apos;s not important .
i &apos;m sure damon will fill you in eventually .
you talked to damon ?
because i just spoke to him ,
and he didn &apos;t really say anything .
weird .
maybe he has his hands full with the whole ,
you know , jeremy situation .
what jeremy situation ?
oh , it &apos;s not a big deal . jeremy got expelled .
expelled ?
yeah , and then he and damon got in this fight ,
and then jeremy bolted .
wait . how do i not know about this ?
where the hell is jeremy ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m here . i was hoping maybe you &apos;d know .
oh , thank god we &apos;re stopping .
if i can only get out of the car .
well , you can &apos;t because as soon as we get gas ,
we &apos;re getting back on the road .
ohh . but i &apos;m dying back here .
you &apos;re not getting out of the car because you want an aspirin .
then maybe i can get out of the car because i need to pee ,
like , in a bathroom like a lady .
hurry .
my throat is really scratchy ,
and my head hurts , like , right here .
when i cough , it &apos;s green .
so get me stuff for all that .
silas knows i &apos;m with you . sorry .
i can &apos;t risk being seen .
please .
fine .
just this .
is that elena gilbert or katherine pierce ?
jeremy , katherine !
stop running .
damon ! towel ! knock !
caroline , no one cares . no .
hey . where &apos;s elena ?
i don &apos;t know . she probably went to the bonfire
to get more intel our weirdo professor .
silas is here .
he &apos;s with elena , pretending to be stefan .
get dressed .
i thought that stefan dropped his body
in the quarry .
join the club . get dressed .
oh , my god . oh , my god . elena was right .
all summer , she &apos;s had this pit in her stomach about stefan .
what ?
i don &apos;t know . she just said that
she had this weird feeling that something
was wrong with him .
put some clothes on . meet me out there .
we have to find her .
jeremy &apos;s still not answering .
i &apos;m gonna hold on to your phone
in case he calls back .
why are you so worried about him ?
damon made a mess , and i want to clean it up .
did he really think that i wasn &apos;t gonna find out ?
it &apos;s damon . are you surprised ?
i just figured we were at a place
where he wouldn &apos;t have to lie to me .
i probably shouldn &apos;t be talking about this with you .
it &apos;s ok .
i know exactly what you &apos;re thinking .
sorry . i don &apos;t mean to cut this short ,
凯瑟琳 · 皮尔斯 9号公路
but someone said they just saw jeremy on route 9 .
do you know where he might be going ?
route 9 ? i mean , there was this old camp site
that we used to go to when we were kids .
wait . who texted you ?
hello , brother .
but i suppose distant nephew is probably more accurate .
where the hell &apos;s elena ?
there &apos;s no need for violence , damon .
you &apos;ll find her eventually .
there you go .
look . i get why you like her .
i mean , i have a soft spot for brunettes , too .
what i don &apos;t get is why she likes you .
it &apos;s because you haven &apos;t had sex with me .
cockiness masking fear . how transparent .
you expect me to believe
you came all this way just to talk to her ?
no . that doesn &apos;t really make much sense , does it ,
but if i told you exactly what i did ,
then it would ruin the fun .
enjoy the bonfire , damon .
why would silas want to hurt her ?
because he wants to hurt me .
you know , if you just would have told the truth ,
all of this could have been avoided .
gee . thanks , caroline . your hindsight is
invaluable in this situation .
watch where you &apos;re going , douche .
have you see elena gilbert ?
i have no idea who that is ,
and if i were her , i &apos;d probably run from you , too .
wrong answer .
forget all this and get out of here .
you have to calm down .
he turned the entire town square
into a hunting party for katherine .
how am i supposed to calm down
when every single person here could be working for silas ?
i got that .
whoa . i ...
boyfriend drama .
wow . boyfriend drama , kicked out of class .
today &apos;s not your day .
what is his deal anyway ?
dr. maxfield ?
yeah , him .
tell you what . help me grab some more firewood ,
and i will tell you everything you need to know .
ok .
i had dr. maxfield for a few classes last year .
he &apos;s a jerk , but he &apos;s brilliant ,
so i &apos;ll give him a pass .
brilliant and creepy .
there &apos;s a rumor that he &apos;s a part
of this secret society on campus .
what , like middle @-@ aged men at an elk lodge ?
i have no idea . all i know is that a few times a week
they supposedly meet at whitmore house ,
but you didn &apos;t hear that from me .
damon ? what the hell ?
seriously ? that &apos;s jesse !
i kind of liked him .
don &apos;t even think about it .
please . i wouldn &apos;t even know how to use it .
i &apos;ve never shot a gun in my life .
didn &apos;t need to .
i was much more deadly .
key word-- &quot; was . &quot;
i &apos;m gonna go get some wood for the fire .
i &apos;ll be back .
i survived childbirth ,
the death of my entire family ,
and 500 years of running from an immortal hybrid .
you can understand why i &apos;m a little upset
that i am on the verge of being defeated by a sinus infection .
not a word out of you .
you can &apos;t talk , you can &apos;t scream .
yeah .
actually , i can .
jeremy , run !
why can &apos;t i get inside your head ?
jaryakat a zem . daryeet acza .
now i see why .
somebody &apos;s already in there .
why are you watching me , traveler ?
odpovezete mi !
jeremy ?
jeremy , hey . there you are , man .
what--
what the hell ?
freaky , isn &apos;t it ,
that feeling , the void ,
the emptiness ?
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
where the hell am i ?
the other side .
gilbert ring brought you here when you died .
that &apos;s how it works .
temporarily brings your spirit here .
to go back , you have to reconnect to your body .
my body &apos;s not even here .
it &apos;s because each time you die you wake up
farther and farther away from it ,
and you wander the other side until you find it .
wait . if i &apos;m on the other side ,
how can you see me ?
there &apos;s something you should know .
all right . before you get mad--
mad can wait . sit .
elena ... wait . wait .
as much as i &apos;d like to do this right now ...
silas got into your head , didn &apos;t he ?
what did stefan tell you to do ?
get you alone , weaken you ...
and then kill you .
damon , i &apos;m so sorry . i ...
what the hell is happening ?
you &apos;re in some sort of silas trance ,
but i think you snapped out of it .
silas ? but i--
before you ask , no . he &apos;s not in the quarry .
it &apos;s a common misconception .
you talked to him today .
how is that possible ?
i--i was in a crowd full of people .
i hugged him . i was talking to him about my life
and about--
me ?
i bet he had some choice things to say .
wait . if that was silas ,
then where &apos;s stefan ?
what happened to stefan , damon ?
where is he ?
can you talk about this when you don &apos;t have
that murdery look in your eyes ?
you &apos;re right . every time i look at you ,
all i want to do is kill you .
it must be silas &apos; mind control .
he &apos;s using your anger at me like a trigger .
you have to resist it .
i can &apos;t !
elena , you have to resist it .
i &apos;m trying !
tell me what &apos;s going on .
sorry . this was all i could find out there .
sorry my friend went aggro .
he &apos;s got anger issues .
and a serious right hook .
yeah .
but , hey , it got us alone together ,
so that &apos;s a win .
i have a boyfriend .
and where is he , other than not here ?
well , he &apos;s supposed to be here .
he deferred a semester .
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i know how these things go .
people go to school , and they drift apart .
yeah , and sometimes , they don &apos;t .
exactly . sometimes , they don &apos;t .
and sometimes , you change ,
but what you had still means something .
yes , yes !
and sometimes when you &apos;re thinking all those things ,
your girlfriend is moving on
and sleeping with somebody back home
and has no intention of getting back with you .
oh , my god . ugh .
i &apos;m so sorry .
it was a while ago ,
and honestly until the worst actually happened ,
i wouldn &apos;t listen to anybody tell me otherwise .
i could always find an excuse , so i get it .
get in the truck and drive .
where are you going ?
i can &apos;t leave matt .
uh , wai--huh .
how do you think i survived 500 years ?
it wasn &apos;t because i was a vampire .
it &apos;s because i never looked back .
don &apos;t be dumb . survive .
that &apos;s why people treat you like an object and not like a person .
it actually hasn &apos;t been so bad .
i have jeremy , and i see grams sometimes .
last night with my dad was the first really hard time .
i &apos;ll be ok . i just have to get past these next few days .
bonnie , you don &apos;t have to pretend like it &apos;s ok .
your dad died , and ...
you died .
it &apos;s not ok .
it has to be .
because there &apos;s nothing i can do about it .
i am so sorry .
matt !
now if my best friend died ,
i &apos;d at least pretend to cry ,
which leads me to believe that he &apos;s not really dead .
i take it that tacky ring somehow protects him .
too bad you can &apos;t get inside my head to find out for sure .
hunter &apos;s perk .
see , that &apos;s what you don &apos;t get .
when i can read your mind ,
i at least have use for you .
now i &apos;m just gonna kill you .
you can try ,
but none of your abilities work on me ,
so right now , you &apos;re nothing .
slower than a vampire , weaker than a vampire .
i on the other hand am a hunter .
plus i work out .
you might be stronger than me ,
but you &apos;re forgetting
that i am immortal .
i thought you said you didn &apos;t know how to use that .
i figured it out .
poor bonnie . she must have tried to call me
right after silas stole my phone .
has anyone talked to her ? is she ok ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve had more important things to worry about .
my best friend &apos;s dad died .
that &apos;s pretty damn important .
yeah ? well , so is protecting your brother ,
finding mine , and figuring out what the hell
silas wants with katherine .
i just left . what the hell is wrong with you ?
you &apos;re getting angry at me again , elena .
remember , trigger .
my brother got expelled !
you &apos;ve got him playing white knight to katherine ,
who &apos;s tried to kill me ...
repeatedly .
stefan &apos;s been ... he &apos;s been suffering for months
while i &apos;ve been rolling around with you ,
a self @-@ proclaimed serial killer .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
elena , that is the gas .
stop . you don &apos;t really want to kill me , elena .
you have to realize this
before you &apos;re gonna break silas &apos; compulsion .
i can &apos;t , ok ? all i can think about is killing you !
well , you &apos;re gonna have to think about something stronger
than your desire to kill me .
or you &apos;re gonna kill us both .
stefan .
stefan .
think about stefan .
caroline told me you &apos;d been worried about him ,
that you had a pit in your stomach .
describe it , tell me about it .
what ? no . i can &apos;t .
think about him .
think about the feelings you &apos;re getting .
describe it to me .
it &apos;s a ... it &apos;s a chill .
i can &apos;t explain it , but it &apos;s like i can feel him .
he &apos;s trying to reach out to me ,
but i don &apos;t know where he is ,
and i can &apos;t understand what he &apos;s trying to say .
all i know is that he &apos;s scared ,
and he &apos;s lonely , and he &apos;s in a lot of pain .
he &apos;s in a lot of pain .
we have to find him .
we will .
i swear .
the rage .
it &apos;s gone .
i think we need to set some ground rules
for when boyfriends come to visit .
i think somebody moved my body .
it &apos;s weird , but i can feel it .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m drawn to it .
there it is .
so if this happens every time
i die with the gilbert ring .
the second i go back ,
that means i &apos;m just gonna forget about all of this .
i &apos;ll forget that you &apos;re dead .
bonnie , you and jeremy can &apos;t keep this a secret anymore .
i &apos;m sorry your dad died .
i know it &apos;s hard ,
but how are you gonna deal with his death
if you can &apos;t even deal with your own ?
it &apos;s really good to see you , matt .
welcome back to the land of the living .
what the hell happened ?
yeah . silas killed you ,
tried to kill me , then ...
i shot him .
so we &apos;re even . no more whining .
let &apos;s go . silas won &apos;t be down for long .
hey . i left the hatchet . i &apos;ll be right back .
you ok ?
i &apos;m not ready to be dead yet , jeremy .
i &apos;m just not . maybe i will be one day ,
but it &apos;s not today ,
and i don &apos;t know what to do about my dad
or what to do when the sheriff calls .
because she &apos;s gonna call me ...
it &apos;s ok . we &apos;ll get through this .
i can tell everybody that you &apos;re with family ,
that it was too hard for you to be here .
i might not be able to touch you or hold you ,
but i &apos;m here for you .
no matter what you need .
did you find that girl that you were looking for ?
yes , i did , and then she shot me .
so i &apos;m a little bit angry ,
and i &apos;m a little bit hungry .
but luckily , you can help me out
with one of those things .
fill her up .
oh , goody . gypsies are here .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . you call yourselves travelers now , right ?
it &apos;s much more p.c.
you can call me whatever you want ,
when i &apos;m gutting you .
i see . you &apos;re mad that i killed
your blond @-@ haired , blue @-@ eyed host , right ?
that &apos;s what you get for taking over somebody &apos;s body
to spy on me , but congrats .
you found me , so now what ?
what do you want ?
you back in that tomb , sealed away for eternity .
that &apos;s what the travelers have always wanted .
luckily for you , i &apos;ve never really considered myself one .
i know you can see inside my mind ,
and i have my own agenda .
yes .
i see that you do .
i &apos;ll be back , roomie .
i don &apos;t know when , but i will be back .
just call me the minute you hear from bonnie , ok ?
i &apos;ve left her , like , a hundred messages .
i will . i promise .
you &apos;re gonna find him , elena .
yeah , i know .
bye .
bye .
i didn &apos;t think elena gilbert would give up so easily .
sorry about being a hard ass earlier .
it &apos;s kind of my thing .
you &apos;re grayson gilbert &apos;s daughter , aren &apos;t you ?
you knew my dad ?
knew of him .
he &apos;s a legend around here . brilliant .
i &apos;ve studied all his research .
i can only hope to do the kind of work he did .
so does that mean that he forged
death certificates , too ?
and here i thought you were just passionate about microbiology .
i have office hours tomorrow .
come by . we can chat .
um , yeah , i would , but i &apos;ve got
other important things on my plate right now .
let me know when that plate clears .
well , i guess that &apos;s how a hero would do it .
honesty . who &apos;d have thunk it ?
aren &apos;t you the least bit curious about the whole
&quot; nancy drew and the creepster professor &quot; thing ?
caroline will take over . i can &apos;t stay here
knowing that stefan &apos;s out there somewhere .
yeah . well ...
that &apos;s stefan &apos;s daylight ring .
snagged it from silas yesterday ,
and for the record , i am secure enough in our relationship
that you having psychic dreams about your ex @-@ boyfriend
does not bother me ...
but it still sucks .
i love you .
we &apos;re gonna save stefan ,
and i &apos;m still gonna love you , ok ?
yeah ?
we found something .
we didn &apos;t find anything in the quarry ,
but a deputy found this a few miles away .
we didn &apos;t open it .
looks like it &apos;s been in there for 3 months .
chances are he &apos;s hungry .
oh , my god . that &apos;s not stefan .
you &apos;re right . he was hungry .
bet he still is .
