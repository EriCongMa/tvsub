For over a century, I have lived in secret.
Until now.
I know the risk, but I have to know her.
What are you?
I'm a vampire.
Tell me about your ex, katherine.
I don't want you seeing Elena anymore.
If you don't remove her from your life,
I will kill everyone that you love.
You must be Elena.
How do we look exactly alike?
The lockwoods are werewolves?
The werewolf gene runs in the lockwood family.
Tell me what triggers the curse!
You have to kill somebody!
The werewolf part of the curse is sealed with the moonstone.
Katherine will only rip your heart out.
Let me do it for her.
You have no idea what you've just done.
Aww. Did I put a kink in your master plan?
Do honestly believe that I don't have a plan B?
Jenna, no!
We were just , sneaking around,
thinking we weren't going to get caught.
But it's over.
I'm going after Tyler Lockwood.
And you're not going to stop...
Until he kills me.
Here.
I'm still shaking.
What happened?
Go ahead, tell him. You're gonna love this.
I saw Katherine today.
Where?
At the grill.
I just stopped by to gawk and...quasi-stalk Matt.
Do you need a table?
No, I'm not staying.
I just need to use the little girl's room.
Skip the teen drama and get to it.
Then I had to pretend to the use the bathroom,
even though I didn't have to go, 'cause I'm a dufus.
Elena?
Hey, I saw you with Matt. Are you ok?
Yeah, ya know...
Whatever.
You're good.
What gave me away? Was it the hair or was it my clothes?
I know Elena's at--
I know Elena's at home.
I need you to deliver a message.
What was the message?
Tell Damon and Stefan that I want the moonstone.
Or I will rip this town apart until it rains blood.
Tell him the rest of it.
Tonight. At the masquerade ball.
She wants to do it in public. Killing Mason through her off guard.
She's running scared.
What she did to jenna was desperate.
She's out of tricks.
We can't underestimate her. We have to play this smarter than her.
Can't we just give her the moonstone so she'll leave?
No. Katherine's not getting dick.
I've had it.
I'm gonna go to the masquerade ball, and I'm going to kill her tonight.
You're not gonna kill her.
Don't give me that goody-goody crap.
You're not going to kill her.
Oh, really?
Because I am.
Easy...
Grab the door, Jeremy.
Stop fussing, I'm fine.
The doctor said that you have to take it easy.
Yeah, you don't wanna rip the stitches, hemorrhage, and die, right?
The only thing I'm gonna die from is embarrassment.
No...
I "walked" into a knife.
How does somebody do that?
It was a freak accident.
It happens.
Yeah. I mean, I've done it, like, 20 times at the grill.
Ok, I'm being nice.
All right, easy...
What should I do with this?
I got it.
So, what are we gonna do?
Make lunch.
About Katherine.
We're not going to do anything, Jeremy.
She tried to kill Jenna. We can't let her get away with that.
Yes, we can. If it keeps us safe, then we can.
What if she tries something else?
She won't.
Katherine hurt Jenna because I didn't do what she said.
Well, I'm doing it now. Me and stefan are over.
She wins. The end.
You're being naive and you know it.
Where are you going?
Out. I'll be back!
Where should I put these?
Right there. Thank you, Miss Flowers.
You've been such a wonderful help.
Oh, it's my pleasure, dear.
Let me know if there's anything else I can do.
I will.
Whoa, Kat, chill.
Do not sneak up on a vampire.
Don't attack a witch.
It's good to see ya, girl.
I'm glad you made it.
You called. I came.
Like you had a choice.
Don't get all boss lady on me. You know I love you.
Now, where does one wear this?
To a masquerade ball. Tonight.
You can be my date.
Hey, come on in.
I got stefan's message.
Hey, you brought the grimoire. Thank you.
What's going on?
We're gonna kill Katherine.
I can explain.
Please.
We're gonna kill Katherine.
Now, this works with compressed air.
The trigger is here.
I've got 2 of these in a different size.
And for you, I recommend this.
Fits nicely under a jacket sleeve.
Here's the trigger when you're ready.
You wanted me to show you how to kill vampires.
What's with the hair?
I'm impersonating my dull as
dishwater doppelganger, Elena.
She has the worst taste.
Except in men.
Isn't it a risk pretending to be her
in front of the entire town?
I've gotten quite good at it actually.
And everyone's gonna be in masks.
It's for some feed the something charity.
It's for a good cause, Lucy.
Hmm. Ok.
Well, have you actually seen the moonstone before?
I always thought it was some made-up legend.
I've seen it. And I need you to help me get it back.
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do with it?
You want me to break the curse.
Let's just get it first.
What I really need is for your back-up.
I can't that imagine Damon and Stefan
are just gonna hand it over
without putting up a fight.
I know you love Elena and
you want to be with her, but it's risky.
Too many people could get hurt.
Look, I want Elena back, yes.
But it's more than that.
What Katherine did to Jenna crossed a line.
And she has to be stopped before it happens again.
I don't know, Stefan.
Look, Katherine knows me, all right?
She knows that I'm not gonna
try something in a crowd full of innocent people.
So, that gives me an edge.
I can catch her by surprise.
I could do a spell to trap her.
Like the tomb spell.
Right. We can isolate her away from the others.
Please, Bonnie?
Ok.
You're welcome to hang out. Alaric's coming over.
It's gonna be pizza and bad TV.
I'd love to but
I'm going to the masquerade party at the Lockwood's.
Aren't you?
Uh, no--
Not with what's going on with me and Stefan.
I've got to go. There's something I've got to do.
What?
Just something. I can't talk about it.
But, I've gotta go.
Ok. Well, have fun.
Yeah, me in a suit.
You look good in a suit.
You and Stefan will work it out.
I don't think so, Matt.
There's so much about me and Stefan that will never work.
You know I'm here for you. Always.
You sure you guys don't want me there tonight?
No, I need you to stay with Elena.
I don't want her to know about this.
Ok. I'll make sure she doesn't leave my sight.
All right. If anybody wants to back out,
I'll understand.
Yeah, cold feet speak now. I don't want this going wrong
because someone chickens out. Caroline?
I won't. She killed me. Fair's fair.
And as long as there are no werewolves running around.
Oh, I took care of Mason.
And as long as Tyler doesn't kill anyone-- he won't turn.
Bonnie? Are you with us?
But no one gets hurt.
Except Katherine.
Tonight, Katherine, gets a stake through her heart.
It's all ready packed out there.
You know, we need to keep that door shut.
Your father would be very unhappy if I let guests in here.
Oh, look at you. So handsome!
Thanks. You look pretty good too, mom.
Oh, a compliment-- I think I'll fall over.
Listen.
I'm sorry I've been a dick lately--jerk lately.
It's just...
Have you heard from Mason?
No, and I don't think we're going to.
He's coming. He's going. It's just his way.
He's the exact opposite of your father.
We should have cancelled this party.
This whole masquerade theme was his idea.
I don't know what it has to do with helping the homeless,
but once he made up his mind, he could really be a dick.
A jerk.
But I loved him.
And I know you did too.
It's natural to feel abandoned.
I just don't want you to feel alone.
Come on, put your mask on.
Let's just go out there and pretend to have some fun.
I think I need a cocktail first.
Elena?
Matt? You look dashing.
I thought you said you weren't coming.
I couldn't miss it.
You really are hot in a suit. I'd love to just...
Ok, here's the deal.
Do you know what you have to do?
I'm going to get Tyler Lockwood really drunk.
I'm going to start a fight with him.
And I'm going to beat him until he snaps.
And then?
I won't stop until he kills me.
God, you're hot.
Now, go away.
Thank you.
Do you see her?
No.
Are you sure you can do this?
Who are you talking to?
I had the chance to kill her, and I hesitated.
Well, that is the fork in the road between you and me, my friend.
I don't hesitate.
You spent 145 years loving her. It could happen.
I won't hesitate.
All right.
We're really not supposed to be in here.
Yeah, I know.
But we really need to turn this party up.
Another shot?
Hey, I want a shot.
Me too. And then we have to dance.
Yes.
You know, usually it's me corrupting you. I like this.
Okay, let's go party. Come on
I thought this room could work.
It's perfect.
Is that the spellbook I read about in my family's old journal?
It was my ancestor, Emily's.
The spell I'm doing here is similar to the one
that sealed the vampires into the tomb.
Can you do all the stuff that's in there?
It takes practice.
I've worked on some small spells.
Spells that only do good. I don't wanna know too much.
I don't particularly enjoy any of this,
in case you haven't noticed.
But you're 100% witch. That is so cool.
It's anything but cool.
Did your family journals tell you what happened to Emily?
Or how about my grams?
It never ends well for people like me.
If you feel that way, why help?
Because I don't want anyone else getting hurt.
And...I don't know how to stay out of it.
I feel like an invalid.
That's because you are an invalid.
Where's Jeremy? Isn't he hungry?
He already left for the Lockwood party.
He went to that?
I'm glad. He needs to have more fun.
Lose some of that emo-thing.
I'm gonna get some napkins.
What's going on?
What do you mean?
I haven't heard from anyone all day.
It's like everyone's been avoiding me.
And now Jeremy's supposedly at the party?
He hates stuff like that.
I don't know what to tell you, Elena.
So then you'll be ok if I just head out,
and try and meet up with everyone?
Wait. Wait. Wait.
What are you hiding, Rick?
Stefan asked me to keep an eye on you,
just in case Katherine showed up while he was at the party.
So, Stefan's at the party too?
He would never go to the party for himself.
He did that stuff for me.
Just let this one go. Ok, Elena?
We need to let Stefan and Damon know the room's ready.
Do you feel that?
What's the matter? You cold?
No.
Excuse me? Do I know you?
Nope. I'm a plus one.
I know no one. It's a great party though.
You Ok?
Just got a weird vibe.
Let's find Damon.
Dance with me.
No.
Fine. You tell me who I should kill.
Him? She looks delicious.
It's a beautiful night.
Why the charade?
How's Jenna? I certainly didn't expect her to survive that.
Lucky girl. Clumsy.
How does one stab oneself?
Katherine.
Hmm?
I don't want anyone to get hurt tonight.
OK. Then give me the moonstone and nobody will.
Well, see I don't have the moonstone on me.
So, you and I will have to go get it together.
Hmm. I have a better plan.
You go fetch it.
And I will try not to kill anyone in the meantime.
My way... Or you don't get it.
Hey, Stefan, I can't find Matt.
Oh my god, Elena, you look so pretty.
I love that dress. You look gorge.
Thank you. I love your necklace.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, it's twisted. Here, let me. Here we go.
Paralyzed from the waist down.
And dead.
The moonstone, Stefan. Tick-tock.
Hey, guys. I'm gonna go to bed. You good over there?
'Night.
Goodnight.
I put her body in the trunk for now.
We can dump her when we get back.
This is what I didn't want, Damon.
Stefan, it's collateral damage.
Right, which is why we need to call it off.
What? Who's hesitating now?
Hey. Don't do this to me!
This woman ruined our lives. She destroyed us.
Tonight it ends.
We can do it together. I got your back.
All right?
All right.
So, can you like do a hocus pocus to ace a test?
I don't know that spell.
That'd be like the first one I'd learn.
Maybe like a sex spell or something. I don't know.
You wanna or dance or something while we wait?
No!
I mean, no thank you.
You didn't tell me there was another witch here.
Didn't I?
No, you didn't.
No one is supposed to know I'm involved.
This changes things, Katherine.
This changes nothing.
You're here because you owe your dear friend a favor.
You wouldn't want to lose my friendship, now would you?
Elena.
Hey, sorry. Could I--could I talk to my sister?
What is it, Jeremy?
I have a message from Stefan.
Oh?
He and Damon want you to meet them at the edge of the lake by the woods.
They brought the moonstone.
And why are you their little messenger?
Because they know I'm not afraid of you.
Ohh. You Gilbert men. So courageous.
How's John, by the way?
Were they able to sew his fingers back on?
What the hell is going on?!
Sorry.
Let's go.
What are Stefan and Damon up to?
What do you mean?
I've got Jeremy Gilbert luring me out to the lake.
What's going on?
I don't know...nothing.
Don't lie to me, Caroline.
They're up to something.
What is it?
I..
Wait, no. Ok.
they're trying to kill you.
I figured as much. Where's the moonstone?
Bonnie has it.
And where's Bonnie right now?
I don't know.
Ok. She's upstairs. She's upstairs.
You guys are trying to kill her here?
We saw an opportunity, and knew we had to take it.
Ok. Stop with the "We." Are you guys crazy?
You could get yourselves killed.
We know what we're doing, Elena.
And how am I supposed to feel
if one of you gets hurt because of me?
It's not just you anymore, Elena.
She's messed with all of us.
She has to be stopped.
Why do you keep dragging me into this?
I don't want to be a part of it.
Shut up. Which room is it?
It's that one.
Where is she?
I did it.
I really didn't think that I'd be able to fool you.
But I did it.
What the...?
Stefan?
Hello, Katherine.
Goodbye, Katherine.
You don't really think
that you can kill me with that, now do you?
No.
But he can.
Elena!
Elena!
What is it?
What's happening?!
What's going on?!
Jeremy, it's Katherine!
She's linked to Katherine!
Get them to stop, now!
Stop! You're hurting Elena.
Everything you're doing to her is hurting Elena.
You think you two are the only ones
with a witch on your side?
Wrong. And something tells me
that my witch is better than your witch.
Jeremy, go check on Elena. Make sure she's ok.
Go!
Let's all make sure poor Elena is ok.
Little bit more pressure.
Bonnie, it hurts.
I can't break the spell, Elena. I'm sorry.
But I can try to take some of the pain away. Ok?
Ok? Ok.
ascinda, mulaf, hinto, ascinda...
This is really going to hurt.
Wait!
Ok. So, how about that moonstone?
Are you ok?
I'm gonna be.
They're stuck in there with her.
You were right.
Katherine had a witch link Elena to her.
That girl I saw.
The one inside.
Stay with her. Keep pressure on her shoulder.
Where are you going?
There's another witch here, I'm gonna find her.
No.
Take this.
No. Jeremy...
Elena, please. Listen to me.
You need this more than I do.
No, Jeremy. What I need is for you to be safe.
The three of us together, just like old times.
The brother who loved me too much.
And the one that didn't love me enough.
And the evil slut vampire who only loved herself.
What happened to you, Damon?
You used to be so sweet and polite?
Oh, that Damon died a long time ago.
Good. He was a bore.
Why don't you two stop antagonizing each other.
Where's the moonstone?
What do you want with it?
Does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?
That was really desperate, Katherine.
Don't you think that we can see through you?
So it doesn't bother you
that Damon is in love with your girlfriend?
Stop.
Of what? You'll hurt me?
Come on, Stefan.
Everything that I feel, Elena feels.
So, go ahead.
Or better yet.
Kiss me, Damon.
She'll feel that too.
You know, this whole Mason thing has me a bit confused.
Why a werewolf?
The moonstone can break a curse
that would help them destroy all vampires.
So, what's in that for you?
Sorry about your pet wolf.
You should have kept him on a tighter leash.
I'll have to remember that for next time.
He's not the only wolf in town.
So what happened to Aimee?
I don't know. She disappeared.
She's probably drunk somewhere.
Like me.
Whoa, don't do that.
What, man? It's a party.
Right, dad?
You know, it looks like your dad...
wants a drink.
Hey. That's not cool.
What is wrong with you?
The guy was a dick.
Come on, you're being mean. His dad's dead.
Gimme the picture. Whoa!
Remember how your dad used to slap you around?
Are you kidding?
Just having fun.
Put the picture down, man.
You need to calm your drunk ass down right now!
Do something about it.
I'm not going to fight you.
What is going on?!
Stop!
Stop!
I can't. Let me go. I have to finish.
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Let me go!
Matt?
Matt?
How did you--
Matt failed. If Matt fails, I can't.
Tyler, look out!
Oh, my god. Sarah.
Sarah, open your eyes. Wake up.
This can't happen.
This can't happen.
This can't be happening. Sarah! Sarah, get up!
Sarah! Open your eyes!
Oh, god.
This can't be happening.
Tyler!
Tyler?
Tyler, what's happening?
Get away!
What's happening?!
Damn it. Where's that witch?
We could play charades?
You bargained the moonstone.
What are you mumbling about over there?
When you struck a deal with George Lockwood
to help you fake your death,
you told me that you gave George something that he needed.
It was the moonstone, wasn't it?
Good for you, Stefan, 2+2...
And it would have worked,
except that people found out I wasn't in the tomb.
Thanks to you.
By the way, have I mentioned how inconvenient
your obsession with me has been?
You and me both, honey.
Why do you need it back?
I love you in a suit. So dashing.
And what were you doing with it in the first place?
You're wasting your breath, Stefan.
Unless, it wasn't yours to begin with.
In 1864, you faked your death.
Who were you running from, Katherine?
In 1987, you were in Chicago,
and a concert of all places.
With that wench Lexi.
Come on, Stefan. Don't look so surprised.
Of course, I checked in on you over the years.
You were standing in the front row dancing all night.
You were watching Bon Jovi, and I was watching you.
Who were you running from?
I love you.
You looking for me?
Who are you?
Lucy.
What are you doing here?
I should have known I'd run into a Bennett.
How do you know me?
you figure it out.
Look, I have no interest in fighting you.
Then stop the spell you put on my friend.
Give Katherine the moonstone, and I will.
Why are you helping Katherine?
Don't you know what she is?
Tell your friends to hand over the moonstone
and all will be groovy.
You're not leaving this room until you stop the spell.
I don't wanna hurt you.
I don't wanna hurt you.
Look, I don't have a choice.
The bitch saved my life, and now I owe her.
I have to pay up.
You have the moonstone.
I can sense it on you.
You feel that?
You can trust me.
Give it to me.
It's ok.
we're missing the party.
I'll have one of those.
right away, miss Katherine.
Thank you.
No! Damon, don't.
Yes, Damon, please.
The second the spell is lifted,
I'm gonna drive this stake right through your heart.
God, you're hot.
When did you get so hot?
Katherine...
The spell in this room has been broken.
You're free to leave.
Thank god.
When I hand this over,
my debt to you is over.
Done.
I owe you nothing.
I said "Done." Give it.
I wouldn't do that.
You should have told me another witch involved.
She's a Bennett witch, Katherine.
But I'm sure you knew that.
Wait, Elena--
Elena's fine.
The spell is broken. She'll heal quickly.
Bonnie's with her.
I apologize for my involvement.
Matt and I were fighting. We broke up, you know.
And Sarah was drunk and dancing.
And she--she just tripped.
And then she wasn't breathing.
Ok. Your mom's on her way.
And we called Sarah's parents.
It was an accident. It was a terrible, tragic accident.
Mom. The sheriff's here.
I'll go prepare her. Just don't leave.
Just stay here, ok?
She's going to want to hear this story from you.
Matt's in the car, sleeping it off.
I'll deal with him.
I don't want him involved in any of this.
What are you doing?
I'm fixing a very bad situation.
Why? I did this.
I killed her.
No, you didn't mean to.
And I think it's best for everyone--
But she's dead.
You don't know what that means.
Actually, Tyler, I think I do.
No, you don't, Caroline.
Has your wound healed?
How did you--
Please, wait.
Hey, I'm sorry about that spell.
Damn vampires.
They pull you into the middle of it every time.
How do I know you?
When I gave you the stone,
How did I know I could trust you?
That feeling you got.
You ever felt it before?
I mean, around family.
My grams.
My mother is Johanna,
first cousin, twice removed from Pauline,
niece of Sheila a.k.a.--
Grams?
We're related?
Yeah, we kinda are.
It's nice to meet you, Bonnie.
Seeing you tonight was a wake up call for me.
I gotta stop letting vampires control me.
So thank you for that.
Please, don't leave.
I have so many questions.
I don't wanna be in the middle either.
I hate it.
How do I stay out of it?
Unlike me, you're one of the good ones, Bonnie.
The middle of it is exactly where you need to be.
You take care, cos.
Don't worry, you'll see me again.
Yeah. I was gonna head home. Can I offer you a ride?
Are you ok?
When did you get your driver's license?
I'm not a kid anymore, Bonnie.
I'd love a ride home.
Elena.
I'm ok. I'm ok. Bonnie took away the pain,
and I think I'm healing.
I know. But I think you should definitely see a doctor anyway.
I will.
I heard about Katherine.
Is it true? Is she really gone?
Yep.
I was so worried about you.
Stefan,
I...
Katherine being gone doesn't change anything for you, does it?
I want to be with you, Stefan, you know that.
But first I need to wake up,
and know that the people that I love are safe.
I need to feel safe.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Yeah. I--I understand.
Hello, Katherine.
Where am I?
Where you should have been all along.
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now
about messing with a Bennett witch.
You should have killed me.
Death would have been too kind.
No! Damon, don't.
Damon, don't.
You need me. Elena's in danger.
From who?
You're lying. You're always lying.
Why do you think I haven't killed her?
She's the doppelganger. She needs to be protected.
Then I'll protect her.
While you rot in hell.
No. Damon, don't.
I'll do anything. Please, Damon.
You need me.
Damon! You need me!
You need me!
Yeah, Jeremy, I've got my car.
Tell Bonnie that whatever she did,
I'm starting to feel better.
Yeah. You can drive her home.
I'm just going to go straight to bed.
