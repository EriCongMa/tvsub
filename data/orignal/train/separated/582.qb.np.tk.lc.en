第三季 第三集
i really made my bones with that last collar , babe .
today &apos;s the day .
you woke up with a guard this morning .
but tonight , you &apos;re going to bed with a detective .
shh ... okay , you get some rest , &apos; kay ?
probably need it .
here &apos;s ben dressed like a dragon .
here &apos;s me and abed dressed as nick nolte and eddie murphy .
who &apos;s nick nolte ?
hey , abed , can i borrow some change for the water fountain ?
yeah . here you go .
thank you .
wait . change ?
hey , dean .
hmm ?
what are you doing ?
nothing after lunch .
and i can skip lunch if you want--oh . that .
keeps tuition down and it saves on water , too .
that &apos;s because nobody &apos;s gonna pay to drink water .
actually it &apos;s a two drink @-@ minimum .
it &apos;ll be reflected in your tuition .
hey , dean . thanks for the new digs .
ah , eh , remember what we talked about ?
we have to keep this whole living situation kind of quiet .
you know , on the d @-@ low .
sure , you know , i &apos;m barely there .
i &apos;m married to the job .
and to a mannequin leg i found in the boiler room .
homewrecker .
your first major lab assignment
is to construct a terrarium .
sort of like a diorama .
you guys have weird reactions to stuff .
hey , can i ask you something ?
this is unrelated .
as someone who just finished spending the majority
of his life in prison ,
what happened with legos ? they used to be simple .
oh , come on , i know you know what i &apos;m talking about .
legos were simple .
something happened out here while i was inside .
harry potter legos , star wars legos .
complicated kits ,
tiny little blocks .
i mean , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s bad , i just wanna know what happened .
all right , fine .
your terrariums are due tomorrow .
and everyone look across the table
at the person in front of you .
that &apos;s your lab partner for the rest of the semester .
saddle up .
who are these people ?
hello , please , professor king .
yes ?
i know you haven &apos;t been here at greendale very long ,
but , um ... we &apos;re a study group .
it &apos;s kind of a thing . we &apos;ve been through a lot .
you probably heard of the space bus .
paintball .
i had sex with eartha kitt in an airplane bathroom ,
and these are the only guys i &apos;ve ever told .
yeah , we &apos;re like a family .
we love each other .
second paintball .
what is happening at this school ?
i have so many conversations that make no sense .
uh , we &apos;d really prefer to partner up amongst ourselves .
i don &apos;t care . go ahead .
it &apos;s not you , it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m just trying to protect us both
from more pain down the road .
i may have a developmental disorder .
i need to catch up on breaking bad , so ...
i &apos;m so sorry .
i have a developmental disorder .
star wars , star wars . cool , cool , cool . hmm .
you understand .
you &apos;re also , quite frankly , a very weird @-@ looking man .
i don &apos;t know you , but i just don &apos;t trust you .
and i don &apos;t think i could grow to like you .
the point of what i &apos;m trying to tell you , todd ,
is that i don &apos;t want to be your lab partner .
no offense .
none taken .
i understand , you wanna be with your friends .
don &apos;t tell me what i &apos;m feeling or thinking . it &apos;s petty .
good @-@ bye , todd .
okay , how are we gonna divide the--
hey , todd ! todd , buddy ! you passed the test .
i &apos;ve been walking my beat a long time , sir .
a long time .
i &apos;ve kept my head down , paid my dues .
and , well , i think i &apos;m ready to make detective .
you &apos;ve only been here a month .
you really haven &apos;t done much of anything .
and there &apos;s no such thing as security guard detective .
we don &apos;t solve crimes .
we barely prevent them .
you wanna detect something ?
do it on your own time .
maybe i will .
&quot; maybe i will . &quot;
my own words rang in my head like a bell inside a head .
maybe i was crazy .
or maybe , just maybe , i was a detective .
hey .
what ?
looking for something ?
no .
she said she wasn &apos;t ,
but her eyes said otherwise .
she was all dame , legs that went all the way
to the bottom of her torso .
the kind of arms that had elbows .
um ... did you just call me in here to stare at me ?
the way she left , i could tell that somebody--
or something--had really put the scare on her .
but what ? why ?
stapler .
was i crazy ?
or were they somehow connected ?
i can &apos;t believe it .
this is the first time there hasn &apos;t been a beetle in here .
should we move outside ?
uh @-@ huh .
did you even hear what i said ?
uh @-@ huh .
seriously ?
is this what it &apos;s gonna be like working together ?
what ?
i lost three followers ?
man , people just can &apos;t handle the truth
about ben sherman &apos;s winter collection .
roommates , study group , lab partners .
we really are gonna spend all our time together .
how awesome is that ?
very . you know what else is awesome ?
last night i saw the hong kong movie
that kickpuncher is based on .
yeah , i know , i was there .
did you see the scene where kickpuncher kick @-@ punches
200 guys with one kick @-@ punch ?
yeah . both of them .
we spend too much time together .
jinx .
here &apos;s ben with his cupcake .
and here he is a few seconds later
when he was crying because he dropped his cupcake .
and here he is with another cupcake .
oh , oh , wait , these pictures are out of order .
that &apos;s the same cupcake .
oh , shirley , these pictures are adorable .
and comprehensive .
but did you know that sugar is like baby meth ?
that &apos;s what my homeopath said .
well , maybe your gay friend should mind his own business .
&quot; forget about the girl , &quot; i told myself .
&quot; let her go , like a lobster claw letting go
of a small balloon for lobsters . &quot;
still , i had a hunch .
hmm . a matchbook .
something about it seemed clue @-@ y .
&quot; arizona matchbook company . &quot;
arizona .
arizona backwards is still arizona !
it &apos;s a palomino !
maybe i was crazy ...
or maybe i was finally sane .
why does this guy keep staring at me ?
britta . what are you doing here ?
oh , i was just getting some air .
me too . and wondering something .
i was wondering something , too .
tell me .
no , you first .
i was wondering , what would it be like
if we were partners ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
were you thinking of changing partners ?
who &apos;s thinking of changing partners ?
were you gonna bail on me ?
no . no one here is thinking of changing partners .
no , sir .
i am !
while he was spying , i found a turtle .
it &apos;s not fair that i should be the only one here
saddled with a total waste of space loser .
no offense , todd .
none taken .
why should you all get the exact partner you wanted ?
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s totally not fair that we saddled pierce with todd .
we should probably choose partners again .
i mean , just to be fair .
so it &apos;s agreed . let &apos;s go to the study room
and deal with this todd problem once and for all .
okay .
um , did you want me to come ?
um , it &apos;s called &quot; the todd problem . &quot;
okay , we just have to come up with a fair way
to decide who is gonna be stuck for an entire semester
with this ... random .
this , uh ... non @-@ grouper .
no offense , todd .
none taken . i &apos;m happy to work with whoever .
there &apos;s only one way to decide this fairly .
we go boy @-@ girl , boy @-@ girl .
but everyone has to have a different hair color .
and be from a different high school .
and be a different race .
i guess i &apos;d be with ... britta .
i guess my--my hands are tied .
the hair color concept intrigues me
because it &apos;s how i distinguish you anyway .
but what if we arrange by age ,
so that way the young people can work while the old people sleep
and vice versa .
um , i @-@ i was just wondering who you considered old ,
because i &apos;d like to remind you again
that i &apos;m just about the same age as jeff .
oh , i was counting jeff as old , too .
oh , well , that &apos;s all right then .
i just don &apos;t understand how my age has anything to--
oh , for heaven &apos;s sake , pierce !
i was thinking the thing that would be most beneficial--
you know , for the group-- would be
to pair the people with the lowest gpas with the highest .
hmm . interesting .
the highest carrying the lowest ?
i can see how you might want that .
you know what , annie ?
pew , pew , pew , pew , p--
wait , no . pew , pew , pew , pew .
does anyone else have kids ?
because i have a gorgeous little newborn that i &apos;d like to get--
oh , perfect !
you &apos;ll enjoy talking to shirley about her kids .
uh @-@ uh , don &apos;t go trying to pawn todd off on me .
again , none taken .
guys , our terrariums are due tomorrow
and it &apos;s already nine .
okay , let &apos;s make this simple and do it like student housing .
everyone write down their lab partner preferences
from one to eight .
abed , you &apos;re a computer .
you figure out a way to put us in our optimal pairings .
and before you all go putting todd down last ,
don &apos;t forget he comes with a turtle .
you &apos;re halfway done .
how does that sound ?
somebody wake up pierce .
hello , arizona matchbook company .
i had to get some answers .
and i needed answers like a fish needs a bicycle
a lot .
hello ? hello ?
yeah , i am , uh , interested in your matchbooks .
yes , would you like to place an order ?
i had to think fast .
yes .
get away from my desk .
i &apos;ll call you back .
you &apos;ve been walking around campus
asking people weird questions and then staring at them
while slightly moving your lips ?
i had to think fast .
no .
ben ... i think this job might be getting to you .
i think you need to take some time off .
oh , you &apos;d like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
very much so . yes .
all right , yep .
according to my system , annie &apos;s gonna be with shirley .
pierce is with me . troy is with britta .
and jeff is with todd .
okay , let &apos;s get to work .
uh , wait . um , how did i end up with todd ?
i mean , no offense ,
but he wasn &apos;t exactly at the top of my list .
none taken .
it &apos;s what the algorithm dictated .
and we &apos;re just supposed to trust your algorithm ?
you &apos;re questioning my algorithm ?
not necessarily . is your algorithm above questioning ?
not necessarily .
will you just tell us how you chose ?
i used the ballots to rank everyone by popularity .
and i put the most popular with the least popular .
i figured it would maximize each partnership &apos;s audience appeal .
oh , i @-@ i see .
so i was number one , and he was obviously number eight .
no offense , todd .
you and todd were four and five .
i was four ?
todd was four .
i was five ?
well , that &apos;s insane !
we don &apos;t even know him .
he &apos;s a stranger .
please , jeff . it has feelings .
wait , so we all know annie was number one ,
because she &apos;d do all the work .
and shirley was her partner , so ...
but that means-- so you all put--
i just worked it out .
i &apos;m more popular than someone !
getting the matchbooks shipped to me the same day wasn &apos;t easy .
i had to pay the company money .
i used nunez &apos;s card .
he &apos;d thank me at the detective awards .
somewhere , somehow , i was gonna find what i was looking for .
holy mary , mother of god .
was i crazy ?
or was i on the verge of something ?
my mind reeled with thoughts .
voices . stand @-@ up premises .
why don &apos;t they just make tires out of pavement
so you can drive on anything ? what &apos;s up with buttons ?
what would happen if nicholson was a gynecologist ?
there was something there .
i need a notepad .
maybe a blazer .
honey , i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t know when i &apos;ll be home .
how could you guys hate me more than pierce ?
or anything more than pierce ?
thin ice , shirley .
my friends and i are not gonna let you
drive a wedge between us .
shirley has a point .
this list stinks like a butt convention .
how else could you explain troy being so unpopular ?
uh , i think i was the popular one in our pairing .
oh , troy .
fine , why don &apos;t i just go work with todd ?
hey , that &apos;s cool , whatever gets this project done .
oh , wow , what a great guy .
i can see why all of you like him so much more than me .
jeff , maybe it &apos;s just that no one wants to carry you all year .
gee , you &apos;re right , annie , it &apos;s not personal .
i mean , it &apos;s not like people really like you .
you &apos;re just a good grade in a tight sweater .
you &apos;re just a bad grade in a tight sweater .
and who the hell are you always texting ?
everyone you know is here .
okay , let &apos;s all just take a breath--
don &apos;t get your number four stink on this , todd .
okay , let &apos;s focus .
we &apos;re all the same people we were 12 hours ago .
maybe we should just revert to our original pairings .
but i thought you didn &apos;t want to carry jeff .
oh , you just don &apos;t want to work with shirley .
you too , brute ?
it &apos;s just ... you &apos;re a creationist !
what ?
you &apos;re so religious .
how are you gonna do science experiments
if you don &apos;t even believe in science ?
just because someone &apos;s religious doesn &apos;t mean
they have a problem with science .
and certainly ,
if an introductory biology course at a community college
can refute 2,000 years of miracles--
and what about britta ?
she &apos;s not gonna dissect anything .
fine , you got me , i won &apos;t dissect anything with a face .
what about worms ?
do they have tiny little faces ?
this is why you &apos;re the stupidest !
if loving worms is stupid , i don &apos;t wanna be smart .
it is , and you can &apos;t be .
guys , i just figured it all out .
pierce , wake up , jeff is gonna heal us .
we have been looking at this totally wrong .
there &apos;s no way i &apos;m unpopular .
one of you monsters just put me last
in a petty attempt to humble me .
i just had a terrible nightmare that jeff was a pompous ass .
also todd was there .
uh , no offense , todd .
i &apos;d poked my nose where it didn &apos;t belong .
someone--or something-- had sent me a message .
veronica .
it was my fault she had gotten mixed up in this .
uh @-@ uh , todd .
pretty sure i heard a fire alarm .
nobody &apos;s going home until we see those ballots .
see the ballots ? are you crazy ?
i say let &apos;s lay our cards on the table
and see what everyone really thinks of each other .
get behind me , abed .
jeff , stop it !
pass !
give it to me ! no , get back , get back !
i am doing this for all of us .
oh , no , she &apos;s got her marijuana lighter .
don &apos;t !
noooo ! the turtle is in there !
oh , my god , i am so sorry !
what is wrong with you people ?
i thought you were supposed to be friends !
i thought you were supposed to love each other !
your love is weird .
and toxic !
and it destroys everything it touches !
i no longer care about grades .
or biology .
or finally graduating from college ,
like i promised my dying father .
i &apos;m going home .
i &apos;m gonna hold my wife and my child close .
and i am gonna finally take my insulin shot !
offense taken .
offense taken .
well , he is right about one thing .
you &apos;re all terrible people .
and i don &apos;t care about this stupid assignment .
i &apos;m going home .
no , i &apos;m not , i &apos;m going to biology class .
it starts in 15 minutes .
and enventually , this caterpillar
will come out of its cocoon . and then--
pop , pop !
nice work , you two .
you know they &apos;re laughing at you , right ?
i mean , that &apos;s my theory .
now , super group .
i can &apos;t help but notice a sorry lack of terrariums .
we didn &apos;t have time to finish .
here &apos;s mine .
when did you even have time to do that ?
you &apos;re pathological .
it &apos;s too late for flattery .
professor , obviously this isn &apos;t working out .
you &apos;re just gonna have to put us with our original lab partners .
all right ?
i don &apos;t have to do anything .
not after you broke my boy todd .
that man called me crying this morning .
you know he fought in iraq , right ?
we had a name for people like you in prison .
we called you &quot; the mean clique . &quot;
but i have a solution .
all seven of you will share a microscope ,
one bench , and one grade that i will average .
everyone else gets their own stuff .
so can we get an extension on the first assignment ?
no . you all fail .
oh , my god .
how did this happen ?
and did i miss the firemen ?
dean , the explanation is simple .
it &apos;s all connected .
a web of conspiracy that goes
all the way to the top of arizona .
all ... right .
hey , somebody &apos;s been squatting in the utility closet .
there &apos;s a hot plate back there , thousands of matches ,
i mean , we &apos;re looking at dozens
of major health and fire code violations .
i think we &apos;re gonna have to get the police involved .
and that &apos;s when it hit me .
i was in really big trouble .
dean .
dean ?
oh , uh ... no .
no need to get the cops .
with a conspiracy this big ,
they &apos;re probably involved .
what ?
what chang says
makes a lot of sense , and , um ...
okay , you know what ? i quit .
i mean , i can deal with the not getting paid ,
but i draw the line at you enabling this man .
i mean , i &apos;m seriously concerned that he &apos;s mentally ill .
and--and it &apos;s not funny at all . it &apos;s scary .
the top of arizona ...
i needed to know more
was it a very high mesa ?
about those firemen .
or was it a state of mind ?
were they ethnically diverse ?
either way , i was going ...
did they bring a dalmatian ?
to have to climb it .
could i buy a calendar ?
okay , screw this . i @-@ i quit .
well , it seems that greendale owes you a debt of gratitude .
how would you like to be the new head of security ?
i had to think fast .
yes .
i don &apos;t know , was i crazy ?
or was i just doing right by the school ?
this is awkward , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , i think it &apos;s pretty clear
what destroyed the balance in our study group &apos;s ecosystem .
ranking one person above another .
letting our differences get the bets of us .
racism ?
no .
todd .
todd !
did you see the head on that guy ?
&quot; none taken . &quot;
what was wrong with him ?
not to be unchristian , but that boy sucked .
i missed this .
and his dumb baby !
i know !
on and on .
he wouldn &apos;t shut up .
these questions are really personal .
are you sure this is anonymous ?
yeah , they &apos;re just practice evaluations for my psych class .
all right . who did a butt ?
they &apos;re boobs . and i don &apos;t know .
take it again .
all right .
somebody drew a penis .
oh ! and another penis .
penis , penis , penis . very mature , guys .
i didn &apos;t draw a penis .
me neither .
yeah , these are all normally filled out tests .
ha ha ! gotcha !
this was also a test , and you all penised .
passed .
maybe i need to take one .
