a witness said he saw you on your cell phone .

the kid , jeffrey grant , he was ...
did you try to get your gun back ?
no .

he was shot during his trial . he &apos;s dead .
we have to delay the deposition .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m just , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m ...
i have to go .
alicia ?
are you all right ?
i &apos;ll call you back , cary .
is she coming ?
where is she ?
i ... um ...
we need to delay this , candace .
what ?
i have to call will &apos;s clients .
it &apos;s not out yet that will is dead ,
but when it is , the clients will be looking around .
david , please .
but more importantly ,
other firms will be poaching .
david , my best friend just died .
diane , i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t want to be doing this any more than you do ,
but the car is moving , and someone has to drive .
i &apos;m just asking your permission to break it to the clients .
all right .
just ... do what you do .
alicia , please call me as soon as you can .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
alicia , it &apos;s diane .
we &apos;re trying to get ahold of you .
please call .
alicia ...
mr. gardner , we &apos;re just about ready here .
h @-@ hold on , your honor .
i &apos;ll call you back .
手机 上午11 : 32
alicia .
mr. gardner , we &apos;re just about ready here .
h @-@ hold on , your honor .
i &apos;ll call you back .
手机 上午11 : 32
i have no idea why he would call .
he called at 11 : 30 .
wasn &apos;t he in court ?
they must &apos;ve been on a break .
was he upset ?
at ?
me ?
no . why ?
candace came to our firm .
we poached her just yesterday .
she was will &apos;s client .
will had dealt with all of that .
you sure ?
you can blame yourself for anything you want ,
but will was ...
he was moving fast on a lot of fronts .
he was ...
i loved him .
i know .
he loved you .
you can stay if you want .
no .
alicia .
this feud , it &apos;s stupid .
i @-@ i care about you too much to let it come ...
alicia , are you kidding me ?
leave my clients alone , alicia .
find your own .
but you do admit to taking the sheriff &apos;s gun ?
you were angry about dr. delaney &apos;s testimony ?
his false testimony .
we &apos;d rather hear it from your client .
you were angry about dr. delaney &apos;s testimony ?
the accused nodded in assent .
but he was lying , right , jeffrey ?
he was the real killer .
i @-@ i didn &apos;t kill her .
i didn &apos;t kill dani .
but professor delaney did ?
why &apos;d you kill your lawyer , jeffrey ?
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s been proved .
jeffrey , why did you shoot at your own lawyer ?
i want to make clear , i have been hired by the grant family
to represent jeffrey &apos;s interests .
there &apos;s no evidence that jeffrey was the cause
of mr. gardner &apos;s death .
according to witnesses ,
there was a hail of gunfire from other swat
and sheriff members on the scene ,
and the bullets that killed mr. gardner may have ...
gentlemen ,
let &apos;s step out for a moment .
i want to say my client has been wrongly accused .
he was placed into a corner by faulty dna evidence
of the cook ...
could you back up a bit ?
we anticipate a suit against this jurisdiction .
your client killed two people in that court .
in a fit of uncontrollable rage ...
he &apos;s not getting off .
... by reason of insanity .
don &apos;t question my client outside my presence .
kalinda , what are you thinking ?
uh , no , no , no . all joking aside ,
illinois only works
if we can put aside our differences
and work together , everybody .
i mean , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s really that simple .
and that &apos;s what i plan to do .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to go find out
what eli gold meant by changing my kids &apos; diapers .
eli , what &apos;s going on ?
you have to greet the press .
no , you need to tell me what &apos;s going on right now .
if i tell you what &apos;s going on ,
you won &apos;t want to greet the press .
this is about will ?
what ?
this is about will .
no .
what do you mean ?
alicia &apos;s gonna talk to him and convince him
not to testify against me .
peter , i can tell you quite definitively ,
alicia is not gonna ...
will is dead .
there was gunfire at the courthouse .
will was shot by a client .
you have to talk to the reporters .
no , i have to ... i have to call alicia .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
i need to speak to my wife .
this is alicia florrick .
please leave a message .
alicia .
mr. gardner , we &apos;re just about ready here .
h @-@ hold on , your honor .
i &apos;ll call you back .
mrs. florrick .
yes .
your honor , do you have a moment ?
it &apos;s not , uh ...
i was about to go home .
it &apos;s about will .
we &apos;re just asking for a 48 @-@ hour delay .
a delay in the deposition ?
yes , there &apos;s been an emergency .
the deposition that was already delayed ?
yes , but that was by another law firm .
alicia florrick has had to deal with a death close to her .
oh . well , i &apos;m sorry ,
but , uh ,
we &apos;re not giving you 48 hours .
we have a window now . take it
or wait another six months to depose .
don &apos;t be a schmuck .
here &apos;s the thing ,
i am a schmuck .
tell her if she wants to go to a funeral , go ,
but there &apos;s a price .
wait another six months to depose ,
or , candace ,
you could settle this right now .
five cents on the dollar .
what do you want to do ?
let &apos;s do it right now .
it was a recess .
mr. gardner and mr. polmar
thought they could reach a plea bargain ,
so i recessed just before lunch .
and you passed them in the hall ?
and will was on his phone ?
yeah .
he left me a voice mail on my phone .
mr. polmar might know what he was calling about .
he was with him ; i didn &apos;t hear .
yeah ?
what happened in court ?
why do want to know , mrs. florrick ?
the accused got a gun from the sheriff .
we were at a sidebar at the bench .
he hit the witness , killed him .
mr. gardner tried to intervene
and take the gun , and he was hit next .
mr. polmar covered him with his body .
uh , mr. polmar ?
a.s.a. polmar .
he &apos;s new ; he was brought in from new york .
he , uh , stayed with will the whole time ,
and he dragged him over to the table .
there was gunfire all over .
the sheriffs were firing back at the accused ,
and mr. polmar was shot
dragging will out of the cross fire .
polmar stayed with him the whole time ?
yes , till the paramedics arrived .
he kept talking to him and ...
holding his hand .
do you know what hospital he &apos;s at ?
it &apos;s being noticed .
let me use your phone .
why ?
&apos;cause i &apos;m the governor ,
and i &apos;m asking to use your phone .
show me how to dial alicia .
it won &apos;t mean anything .
what ? if she picks up your call but not mine ?
that won &apos;t mean anything ?
eli , not now .
no , it &apos;s not eli .
it &apos;s me . i , uh , tried you on my phone .
i couldn &apos;t reach you .
sorry .
i had my phone off .
i @-@ i just , i just took it out now .
i just called to tell you that i &apos;m sorry .
i heard about will .
thank you .
where are you ?
i &apos;m at ...
chicago general hospital .
is that where he is ?
no , um , i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know where ...
who &apos;s there ? diane ?
no , the prosecutor .
uh , he @-@ he was ... shot , too .
that &apos;s terrible .
terrible .
how long are you gonna be there ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , i @-@ i &apos;m gonna come to you .
no .
alicia , i &apos;m coming to you .
peter ,
i &apos;m fine . please , i @-@ i &apos;m fine .
i &apos;m your husband , and i should be there .
yes , and you &apos;re the governor .
wherever you go , there &apos;s an entourage ,
and i can &apos;t deal with that right now .
yeah , okay .
you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m so sorry .
thank you .
good @-@ bye .
is she all right ?
you called justice ?
you called agent dubeck about a half hour ago ?
yes .
don &apos;t .
don &apos;t what ? i &apos;m just doing ...
no , you &apos;re not .
this is about will being dead , right ?
and now that he &apos;s dead ,
justice has no case against me , right ?
yes .
can we just take a minute ?
can you just stop and not think about the angles right now ?
peter , don &apos;t scold me for trying to protect you .
you don &apos;t think i want to be doing something else ?
yeah , you &apos;re right .
i apologize .
what room is finn polmar in ?
chicago general hospital , may i help you ?
it was all a mistake .
can you believe it ? they thought it was me
because the body was shot in the face .
sorry , may i help you ?
polmar . finn polmar &apos;s room .
you &apos;re looking for finn ?
yes .
i &apos;m maria , his assistant .
he &apos;s in surgery right now ,
but he should be out pretty soon .
you &apos;re ...
alicia florrick .
i just wanted to see if he was all right .
mrs. florrick .
he &apos;s much better now , thanks .
how do you know finn ?
i ...
don &apos;t , really .
i knew will .
oh , my god , of course .
i am sorry .
it was so weird to be with him today ,
and now this .
you were in court ?
no .
in the , uh , plea bargain .
did will ...
step out to make a call in the middle
of the plea bargain session ?
yeah .
he made a phone call ?
yes .
do you know why ?
no , but it wasn &apos;t good .
what do you mean ?
he was angry .
really pissed .
someone was stealing his clients ,
and he was calling them about it .
i had to go out and interrupt him .
i @-@ i told him that finn was ready .
it was sad .
want me to tell finn you dropped by ?
no , that &apos;s all right .
there &apos;s one problem .
i called bob klepper .
he wants to hear from you before he considers staying .
oh , dear god .
i wouldn &apos;t have bothered you with this ,
but he &apos;s one of will &apos;s ...
top clients , i know .
i will see him tomorrow .
he said today or he &apos;ll start making calls .
do ever think we chose the wrong profession ?
i &apos;ll ask if he &apos;ll take a call .
no , tell him to come in .
that &apos;s what will would do .
so this was all an unfortunate misunderstanding ,
dr. levine ?
yes .
i fired candace because of performance .
that &apos;s all .
thank you , doctor .
anything , cary ?
mr. agos ?
when was the last time you had sex with your wife ?
come on , cary , relevance .
the fine , upstanding doctor said
he was happily married ,
and that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t fire my client because she was too pretty .
i &apos;m just examining the truth of his contention .
nah , this is pure harassment .
when was the last time you had sex with your massage therapist ?
okay , that &apos;s outrageous .
are you serious ?
totally irrelevant to the case .
here &apos;s an affidavit from beverly jensen admitting
you had sex on five separate occasions .
this deposition &apos;s over .
let &apos;s get the judge on the line .
dr. levine has a patient ,
so we &apos;re gonna need to delay this after all .
you &apos;re the one who went to the judge
insisting the deposition could only be today !
so let &apos;s get the judge on the line ,
but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna be in a giving mood !
what do you want ?
i want to get out my aggressions and my anger
by destroying your client .
now sit down .
i said sit the hell down .
hey , jenna , kalinda .
i &apos;m sorry about this .
how many wounds ?
three , all glocks , g19 .
the same gun ?
no , don &apos;t know .
g19 seems to be the sheriff gun of choice .
what &apos;s going on , kalinda ?
we &apos;re trying to figure out how mr. gardner died .
was it from jeffrey grant or the cross fire ?
i &apos;ll have the report out tomorrow .
we don &apos;t want to wait .
the bullet to the thorax was the one that killed him .
the other two shots ,
the one to the right shoulder and the stomach ,
they were survivable . it was the first .
and who shot the first ?
why ?
because i want to know .
the shot to the thorax was from close range .
close range meant it came from the accused ,
jeffrey grant .
okay , thanks .
let me see him .
no need .
i have the family coming in for an i.d.
kurt , just let me see him .
hey , kalinda ?
jenna , just give me a second , please .
yeah .
yeah ?
i &apos;m going crazy .
i know .
i ...
i don &apos;t know what to do , kalinda .
i have to go .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
it sounds like you do know .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;ll see you later , alicia .
thank you , mr. klepper , for coming in .
you can understand this has been a difficult day .
i do .
i loved will .
he was my lawyer for eight years .
diane , how are you doing ?
not good .
i &apos;m sorry . thank you for seeing me on such short notice .
let me make something clear up front .
i want to stay ,
but with this product manufacturing lawsuit ,
i need to know where we stand .
well , diane is best to talk to then .
good .
so , you &apos;ll be able to take over for will .
i will ,
but instead i &apos;m going to fire you as a client .
what ?
you &apos;re no longer a client here .
i &apos;m not ?
you &apos;re not .
uh , i can go to lake &amp; tordello .
yes , i know that ; that &apos;s why i talked to them .
they won &apos;t take you .
they will .
no . they don &apos;t like the way you &apos;ve ... handled this .
florrick / agos solicited me .
yes , i know , and i just talked to cary .
he won &apos;t take you either .
they liked will .
they don &apos;t like you .
okay . i &apos;ll give you a few days
and then we &apos;ll talk .
no , you &apos;re fired , mr. klepper .
you don &apos;t belong here anymore as a client .
we &apos;ll transfer your files to your home .
this is insane .
do you know how much business i bring in here ?
i do .
that &apos;s what makes this so difficult .
it &apos;s not what will would do .
if i were dead ,
it &apos;s exactly what will would do .
that felt good .
turned me on .
mom ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
i know you don &apos;t believe it ,
but he &apos;s , um , he &apos;s with god .
what does that mean , grace ?
he &apos;s in heaven with angels and clouds ?
i don &apos;t know .
i , i don &apos;t think you can really picture it .
but you believe it ?
why do you think will is in heaven ?
he was a good person , wasn &apos;t he ?
he ...
he did some bad things ,
but he did them because ...
because he wanted to be good .
well , then he &apos;s in heaven .
i can &apos;t believe that , grace .
why ?
you think god is good ?
i don &apos;t find any good here .
a kid picked up a gun , didn &apos;t even mean to shoot will .
it &apos;s just some stupid accident .
what does ... what does it mean ?
well , what does it mean if there is no god ?
why is that any better ?
it &apos;s not better .
it &apos;s just truer .
it &apos;s just not wishful thinking .
well , maybe always believing the bad ,
maybe that &apos;s wishful thinking , too .
mom , i just want you to be happy .
i will . i will eventually .
okay , i have to get this .
hello .
mrs. florrick ?
yes .
this is finn polmar .
oh , uh , yes .
how are you ?
uh , a bit loopy . the painkillers ...
uh , maria said you wanted to talk to me about will ,
about our last conversation .
yes , but that can wait till tomorrow .
well , why tomorrow ?
i &apos;m up all night .
what do you need , jenna ?
uh , just stretching my legs .
what about you ? why do they got you here ?
suicide watch .
every 30 minutes .
kid who shot up the court ?
yeah .
watching anybody else ?
a few cells at the other end .
why don &apos;t you go take a look ?
it &apos;s my responsibility .
now it &apos;s mine .
why &apos;d you do it ?
you killed my friend .
i didn &apos;t mean to .
you shot him .
you didn &apos;t mean to , but you shot him .
you want to die ?
i have your belt .
i took it from property .
the guard will be away for ten minutes .
that &apos;ll give you enough time .
what are you doing ?
no , you &apos;re gonna live with this .
you know will was a good man ,
and i loved him ,
and he was trying to help you .
so you live with that .
no .
no , no , no , no , please .
no .
please .
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m finn .
alicia .
i guessed .
i would ask you to sit , but i am in the only chair .
no , no , you can sit on the bed .
no , i &apos;m fine .
are you in pain ?
well , not tonight , but tomorrow will be interesting .
sorry , the painkillers ...
oh , no , don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t be sorry .
you &apos;re reading cicero ?
no , no , that was a @-@ a joke from my assistant .
i have no idea what it means ,
but i will be asking her tomorrow .
no , we &apos;re good .
um , so , uh ...
you knew will .
i did .
i liked him .
i liked him a lot .
he @-@ he really had me at the trial .
i was losing .
i heard you tried to save him .
yes , that wasn &apos;t too smart , was it ?
thank you .
yeah , he kept , um ...
i don &apos;t know .
uh , could , uh ...
could you pass me the water ?
i thank you .
yeah , he , uh ,
he kept moving his lips
like he wanted to talk .
i was right over him ,
and he was staring up at me ,
and he kept ...
opening his mouth .
i don &apos;t know , maybe he didn &apos;t see me there .
i don &apos;t know .
if i start making sense , will you tell me ?
you &apos;re making sense .
thank you .
and he ... reached up . he could still move his hand ,
and he grabbed mine .
i asked him if he was all right ,
and he just kept holding my hand ,
kept squeezing it ,
while we were waiting for the paramedics to arrive .
it &apos;s really pretty awful , isn &apos;t it ?
yes .
maria said that he was angry during the plea bargaining session ,
that he stepped out to make a phone call .
uh , yes .
uh , some guy he needed to find .
some guy ?
damian ... something .
he , uh , he stole some clients .
i &apos;d offer you a chair , i really would , but ...
no , no , i &apos;m fine .
you want food ? there &apos;s food .
no , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m good .
will called me at 11 : 30,
just before your bargaining session .
do you know why ?
no .
he didn &apos;t say anything ?
no .
i had some pictures on my phone .
my wife , my son .
he asked me about them .
what did he ask ?
their names .
you should get to bed .
i really should , shouldn &apos;t i ?
could you tell the nurse ?
yes .
thank you , finn .
i wanted to tell you something .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry .
i really am .
are you all right ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m really sorry about will .
i know .
alicia , i &apos;m sorry .
i want what we had .
i want to be with you ... and only you .
forever .
call me back , please .
