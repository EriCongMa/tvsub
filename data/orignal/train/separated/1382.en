Hi, Mom.
Hi, baby.
I brought you a whole bunch of photos.
Thank you!
Yeah, anything to make this place
look a little more homey.
How you doing?
Me? I'm okay.
Why?
Oh, just 'cause, you know,
I mean, we had that conversation about my work,
and, you know, we never...
You never really brought it up again, so...
Neither did you.
Well, that's because you acted like everything was fine,
and, you know, I didn't want to --
Well, that's what this mother does.
She acts like everything's okay...
even if it's not.
I know that it bothers you, Mom.
Look...
I wish I didn't say all of those things
I said the other day.
I-I wish I had said them differently.
But, honestly, it's -- it's complicated.
I mean, I respect what you do.
But it's hard for me sometimes.
I get that, Ma.
I do.
Good morning.
Hi.
Hi. How are you?
I was up late last night.
Wait, don't tell me.
You attended a lecture on the life-span of parasites
in open wounds.
No.
No, I was volunteering at Hope's clinic again,
and I want to thank you for encouraging me.
Yeah, No problem. Any time.
Did you get Korsak's call about the shooting?
I did, and I told him that I would wait for you, so...
Well, we're off to the park.
‭It's nothing dangerous.
I love you.
I love you, too.
It's so satisfying to really connect with the patients
that I'm helping.
You know, and Hope was so lovely.
You know, sharing her passion for her work
really brought us closer together.
You know, last night, she was telling me this story about --
I got a job offer.
What kind of job offer?
A teaching offer.
Um, a -- an instructor...
at the FBI Academy in Quantico.
What do you think?
Wow. I...
I-I don't know. What do you think?
I mean, it's a good job.
It's...good money, excellent benefits.
You know, but I'd have to leave my family...
BPD, Boston.
I think it's extraordinary.
Just, I don't know if teaching is just the thing for me.
Okay, so let's do the pros and cons.
Okay.
No more calls in the middle of the night.
Yeah, but there's not that much excitement
in a regular 9:00 to 5:00.
All right, but you don't have to chase vicious criminals
into dangerous situations.
Okay, well, that's just good exercise.
I'm sure they have a gym.
Okay, how about this?
Uh, no one will be shooting at you.
And that's a good thing?
It is for your mother.
All right, well, just keep this between us
until I figure out what I'm gonna do.
Of course.
Thanks.
Beautiful morning in the park, Sergeant.
Not for this guy.
Jogger found him, called it in earlier.
Any witnesses?
No, it was too early. Nobody around.
That is some shotgun wound.
Yeah, I've got uniforms
searching the area for a murder weapon.
Nothing yet.
Well-dressed guy alone in the park.
Maybe it was a robbery.
Still had his wallet and a Rolex watch.
Name is Michael Steele, 1818 Deckard.
I sent Frankie to the house.
I'm gonna get Nina to do a full background check.
Maura, what do you got?
Well, the fatal shotgun round
appears to be a double-ought buckshot.
Spread pattern indicates that the shots
were fired from approximately 15 to 20 feet.
Looks like there might have been someone in the bushes.
Branches are all broken, and the ground's matted.
You think they were lying in wait?
That doesn't make any sense.
It's not a professional hit.
A pro wouldn't use a shotgun.
It's not a robbery. Nothing's taken.
Could be random.
I hate random.
Oh. I hope you're having better luck than I did.
The victim had a very nice apartment near Fenway,
but it was clean.
Everything was in its place.
However, I did...
find this cellphone bill, which is weird,
because there was no phone in the apartment
or with the body at the crime scene.
Can you run this through the tracking system?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Well, what did you learn about the victim?
Uh, he's a 42-year-old CPA with his own small firm.
Specializes in forensic accounting.
He freelances with a variety of financial companies.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
No money problems, no criminal record,
no pending litigation.
Well, someone didn't like him.
Okay, Nina...
what's wrong?
Did I do something or...
No.
It's got nothing to do with you. Not really.
"Not really" means it has everything to do with me.
My mother is in town.
Oh, I thought you and your mother were close.
Yeah, but I don't like the way she treats my boyfriends.
Okay.
It'll be fine.
You don't know how she is.
How is she?
We got a location on the cellphone.
Nina says the victim's cellphone
is pinging off the tower due east of here.
Call the number.
How the hell did his phone get so far away from his body?
I don't know. Maybe the murderer took it.
Killed him for his cellphone?
What's the world coming to?
Maybe he had something on the phone that the murderer wanted.
Over here! We got another body!
Hey, call an ambulance! This one's alive!
Vince Korsak. We need an ambulance at the park.
Yeah.
We found another guy.
I'll check on him.
No, no, no. He's -- He's still alive.
The ambulance is on its way.
He had the phone, and he had this.
婚礼教堂
Edward's the other guy?
Who's Edward?
My ex-husband.
What can I tell you about Edward Dunn?
I could think of a few things I'd like to know.
All right.
He came from a wealthy family.
His father, Phillip, runs a large investment firm --
Dunn Global Holdings.
And Edward's a civic leader, a philanthropist.
How long were the two of you married?
Well, we came to our senses,
and we had the marriage annulled the next morning.
About the time the booze wore off.
We were young and foolish, not drunk.
This is a police station.
This is not "The Jerry Springer Show."
Maura's marriage has nothing to do with our investigation,
so let's focus on the facts, shall we?
Yeah.
So, what can you tell us about Edward pertaining to our case,
and not the marriage that we know nothing about?
Well, I haven't seen him in years.
You know, I read recently in the paper
that he took over the company
because his father died of a heart attack.
But that's about it.
Okay. Thank you, Maura.
So...
you'll let me know if his condition improves?
Of course.
Okay.
What? I'm just curious.
Can you work up a background of Edward Dunn, please?
Yeah.
So, what do you think Mr. Isles
was doing in the woods with a dead man's cellphone?
I'd certainly like to ask him.
What did the hospital say?
He's stable. Still in a coma, unable to speak.
Joann?
Hi. How are you?
Hi.
Good.
Been busy. You know -- Girl Scouts, Little League.
How's Ron?
Dad's okay.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.
Take care.
You too.
Wait. Angela.
I was sorry about what happened between you and my dad.
I never meant...
You don't have to apologize.
We do what we have to do for our children.
I just never thought that what I said would break you guys up.
Well, your dad's a wonderful man
with a family that he loves,
and I just didn't want my stuff to, uh, come between you two.
I saw a picture of your little guy on Facebook --
with the Legos.
Yeah.
Yeah, so cute.
Thank you.
Take care.
You too.
I take it there were no surprises
regarding cause of death.
No.He died of massive hemorrhaging from a shotgun wound.
There was no other drugs or alcohol in his system.
All of the physiology was very unremarkable
and what we'd expect to find in a healthy 42-year-old man.
What about the clothes for Edward Dunn?
There was some blood on his jacket
that matched the victim's.
Oh, and we found some gunshot residue on Edward's coat.
Enough to make him the shooter?
Mm, it's hard to say.
But it doesn't rule him out as a shooter?
No, it does not.
All right, well...
we will broaden our search for the weapon.
Maybe he tossed it when he was running from the scene.
He could have.
How's she doing?
Oh. I don't know. She's been very quiet.
All right.
Our victim and Edward have nothing in common.
But starting about a week ago,
there's a series of calls between them
from their business phones.
Why would a big investment fund
go to a small accounting firm with one accountant?
They might not have.
Our victim, Michael Steele,
was a forensic accountant -- a whistle-blower.
Nina uncovered a string of complaints
that he made to the SEC about several investment firms.
I bet that made him popular in financial circles.
Did he file a complaint against Edward's firm?
No.
Maybe he was about to.
Dunn took over his father's firm six months ago.
What if he's suddenly got a whistle-blower
breathing down his neck about financial improprieties?
Well, if Edward killed the accountant, where's the shotgun?
Maybe Edward took some muscle with him to pull the trigger,
and that person got away with the gun.
What do we know about Edward's father's death six months ago?
Heart attack.
He was rushed to Bayview Hospital
and then pronounced dead in the ER.
Autopsy?
No. And the body was cremated.
A lot of people dying around Maura's ex-husband.
I just discovered something else about Edward.
He's married.
Yeah?
Okay. We'll need to talk to the wife.
I know where to find her.
I got some information about Edward.
Okay.
He's still married...
to you.
Yes, I understand that the annulment papers
were never filed.
What I don't understand is why.
Okay, great. Thanks.
For nothing.
Sounds like that went well.
An old associate of my Vegas divorce lawyer
looked into the situation,
and it seems the lawyer had a massive stroke
before filing the annulment papers.
Well, then it's official -- you are married
to the prime suspect in our murder investigation.
No, Ed-- Edward had nothing to do with this.
Well, now, that's just got to be the wine talking,
because you don't make definitive statements
about cases without proof.
Well, since my husband is a suspect
in an ongoing murder investigation,
then I must recuse myself...
which means that I am free to guess, presume, and surmise,
hypothesize, theorize, even speculate.
Knock yourself out, girlie.
God!
Edward...
Edward isn't capable of murder.
He is a good, honest man.
And I would expect nothing less of your husband, Maura,
but we need more than a character recommendation.
We need real proof.
Well, I believe that the blood on Edward's jacket
was transfer, not spatter.
Okay, what about the gunshot residue?
It's minimal.
I think it came from touching the victim,
not firing a gun.
Why would he take the victim's cellphone?
To call 911.
He didn't make the call.
Because someone was shooting at him.
We don't have proof.
No.
No, but I found a small hole with a rounded edge
on the sleeve of Edward's jacket,
and it could easily be a piece of buckshot that nicked him.
You're guessing, Maura.
I'm just following my gut, like you do.
Well, if you're right, there would be buckshot in the trees
in the same direction that Edward was running.
Well, that would be the proof that we both are looking for.
I'll send CRSU back out there first thing tomorrow morning.
So, is there a reason that you didn't tell us about Edward?
It's just so far in the past.
And that makes it not important?
No. No, it just...
it makes it a really long story.
Well, good thing we got two bottles of wine.
We met in college.
He was cute and fun, and, you know,
we had a passionate relationship for a few months.
And then his mother didn't think I was good enough for him,
and she wanted him to marry a debutante.
So Elvis and Priscilla ran off to Vegas.
Yeah, that was us being rebellious.
We had a wild weekend, got married,
and woke up the next day
and realized that we had made a very big mistake.
Why was it a mistake?
Because I wanted to go to med school and Tilly --
Wait, wait, wait. Who's Tilly?
His mom.
She wasn't gonna allow Edward to leave Boston to go with me.
So it ended as fast as it started.
Are you sure about that?
'Cause he's still carrying a picture of you
around in his wallet.
Yeah, I can't explain that.
But ending it was the right thing to do for me.
It's hard to make those life choices, but...
it was the right thing to do.
Are you talking about me and the FBI now?
No.
Good.
You know what I was thinking?
I bet you're gonna get a 10% employee discount
at the FBI gift shop.
Okay, now, that is a reason to move to Virginia.
I wonder what Tilly's gonna say
when she finds out you're still married to her son.
Oh. She's not gonna be happy.
That witch controls everything in that family.
Witch?!
Wow. Now you sound like the angry daughter-in-law.
Must be the wine talking.
Education?
Just high school and the police academy.
No. When my mom grills you,
you need to sell yourself more.
What am I -- a used car?
For the minute, yeah.
Well, after graduating with honors
from Saint Dominic's High School,
I... felt the calling for public service,
and I enrolled in the police academy.
Graduated second in my class.
Can you tell me a little bit about your work history?
For the last three years, I've been a homicide detective
with the Boston Police Department.
My conviction rate is over 90%,
and someday I hope to be the chief of police.
You do?
No.
I'm just trying to sell myself.
What about your finances?
Well, I contribute regularly to my IRA.
At 55, I'm gonna be eligible for my full pension
at 80% of my salary.
Health?
Excellent.
Any mental illness in your family?
Have you met my mother?
No, no, no jokes, Frankie.
Especially about mothers.
All right, no mother jokes.
Maybe we should just forget it, act like we're not dating.
You're joking, right?
Was your son under any amount of stress?
Not that I was aware of.
Well, I know he works for the company.
Profits are up, and our customer base is expanding.
The company's on solid financial footing with Edward now.
Do you work for the company?
No.
Dunn Global Holdings has many of their clients
invested in my hedge fund...
Which happens to be at an all-time high.
Uh, was there any bad blood
between your husband and your son?
I don't understand why you're asking all these questions
about my family and our business.
Just routine background information.
Did you know Michael Steele?
I saw on television that he was shot in the park.
Do you know why your son would be associating with
an accountant and a whistle-blower?
Is my son a suspect?
He's a person of interest.
In a homicide?
I can't believe it.
Well, I shouldn't be surprised.
I saw that Maura Isles is involved in this investigation.
So this is a way for her
to get back at our family after all these years.
Hello?
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Yes, we will be right in.
Edward's awake. The doctor is in there with him.
The worst is over now.
Oh, I doubt that.
I would like to speak to him.
My son just came out of a coma.
I am not about to let you accuse him of murder.
CRSU found buckshot in the trees.
Fired in the same direction Edward was running?
Well, someone was trying to shoot him.
Probably with the same gun.
So Michael and Edward were both targets.
Well, Edward was just a little luckier than Michael.
Well, get the buckshot down to the crime lab.
Maybe we can get fingerprints or DNA off it if it was handloaded.
I already sent it to Kent.
And call Jane and let her know she was right.‬
Looks like Edward's no longer a suspect.‬
No, Ma.
What do you think you're doing here?
If you've come to accuse him of murder,
I am calling our lawyer.
I'm here to tell you that Edward is no longer a suspect.
We've found evidence
that he was actually the target of the shooting.
What evidence?
There was buckshot fired in the direction that he was running.
I don't give a damn what you found.
I want you to leave my son alone.
Your son is now a witness in a homicide.
I don't need your permission to talk to him.
Edward, we're all very sorry about what you've been through.
Can you remember anything
about the person that was shooting at you?
I don't have anything to say to you.
You understand that you're no longer a suspect
and we could really use your help?
I just told you -- I don't have anything to say to you.
Can you leave my room?
I just don't get it.
Why wouldn't he tell me who's trying to kill him?
‭Well, maybe he doesn't know.‬
Well, why wouldn't he just say that?
I mean, clearly, he's covering for someone.‬
Well, it sounds like Tilly pulled ranks
to protect the family and the firm.
Okay, well, that doesn't make sense, either.
If somebody's trying to kill her son,
why wouldn't she talk to me?
I don't know.
Well, can you talk to him?
I'm willing to try.
All right, and you need to convince him
that finding a killer is more important
than saving the family's reputation.
Well, that's gonna be hard to do with Tilly there.
Yeah, I know. I got an idea.
Aah! Still too hot.
The precise cooking time of this oven seems to elude me.
You start eating ramen in college?
No.
This is not very popular with the old Weegie.
It's not fried.
No, I discovered this delicious delicacy in the army.
Food of the gods.
You need to get out more.
You don't know what you're missing, Sergeant.‬
Well, while I'm missing it, could you bring me up to speed
on the buckshot?
Ah, yes.‬
We couldn't retrieve any DNA or even a partial print
as it's a commonly used machine-packed ammo.
I was afraid of that.
But I did discover trace amounts of rust
on many of the pellets.
Lead doesn't rust.
No.‬
I believe the pellets picked up the particles
from a rusty shotgun barrel.
So this got me thinking, "In turn,
what could the pellets have picked up from said barrel?"
A curious mind is a wondrous thing.
Well, I decided to indulge my curiosity
with further metallurgy tests.
I discovered that the pellets picked up trace particles
of a hardened steel laminate
with a carbon point of .06.
We need to check with the FBI firearms database.
I did.‬
This specific steel laminate was used by one gunmaker --
Bercotti, between 1911 and 1912.
There are fewer than 40 of these rare shotguns
still in existence.
Did you also find out who in Boston might own one?
Ah. That's where I pass the baton.‬
That's your job, Sergeant.
I'm happy to share if you like.
Another time, maybe.
I have no intention of answering any more
of your questions, Detective Rizzoli,
so if you have more questions, contact my lawyer.
I'm so sorry for the disruption.
How are you feeling, honey?
I'm feeling better.
Although I am dying for a cup of chicken soup.
Well, then I will walk across the street to the deli
and get you some.
I was hoping you would say that.
Thank you, Mother.
Long time no see.
I recall it being a mutual decision.
You look good.
So do you.
Uh, you come all the way down here just to lie to me?
Absolutely not.
Okay, so then let's just agree‬
that I look okay under the circumstances.
Speaking of which, what's going on, Edward?
Nothing, really.
Wrong place, wrong time.
You were carrying around our 20-year-old wedding photo.
I found it in a box the other day.
Reminded me of a carefree time.
Now who's lying?
I think you were carrying it around‬
because you're in some kind of trouble
and you thought I was the one person in law enforcement
who you can trust.
You still know how I think.
You still think you can trust me?
Absolutely.
Okay, then let me help you.
Tell me what's going on.
My -- My mother's gonna be back soon.
You want to get out of here?
After I took over the company,
I found something in my father's private accounting ledgers
that I can't explain.
What did you find?
My father was making payments to several clients
through an old company of his,
but he was using funds from our family's holdings.
Well, that's unethical and maybe illegal.
Right, and not anything like my father.
Is that why you hired Michael Steele?
I thought that I needed a forensic accountant
to get to the bottom of it.
A couple of days ago, he calls me,
and he says that he'd found out what my father had done.
And so we agreed to get together to discuss it.‬
Why meet at the park?
I wanted to keep my meeting a secret
until I knew what was going on.
But when I got to the location...
Michael had been shot.
I checked his pulse,
and I grabbed his cellphone to call 911.
Then somebody shot at me.
I took off running.
Did you get a look at the shooter?
No. He was shooting from the bushes.
Falling down that hill --
That's the last thing I remember before waking up here.
What about the accounting ledger
that you were supposed to go over?
There was nothing around Michael when I found him.
So whoever killed him might have taken the documents
and was waiting to shoot you.
Who else knows about these documents?
I found them on my father's computer,
and then I destroyed the hard drive.
But he hid a second copy of the documents at his house.
Well, we need to see those documents,
figure out who's trying to kill him.
I'm on my way there now.
Well, we don't have a warrant, and, personally,
I don't think we have enough evidence to get one.
Well, any reason that his wife couldn't go over to the house
and get the documents and turn them over to the police?
Well, did you tell him you're still married?
Of course.
And he knows you're going to his house?‬
He gave me a key. He wants me to have the copies.‬
Ooh, I think we're starting
to see that wild and crazy Maura Isles again.
See you back at BPD.
Ma.
Nina's mom is here right now.
They're outside parking,
and they're gonna be in here in a minute.
Oh. Mother's first meeting.
Yeah. We're pretending we're not dating.
Why are you doing that?
Long story.
Bottom line,
Nina's not ready to introduce her mom to her boyfriend.
So why are you two bringing her here?
She surprised us at work.
And Nina introduced me as a coworker,
and then her mom invited me to join them for lunch, so...
Do not lie to her mother.
I'm not lying to her, I'm just going along with Nina's plan.
Yeah, well, moms are smart.
Don't think you're gonna fool her.
We will if you play along.
No.
Hi, Angela.
Hi, Nina!
Hey!
I want you to meet my mom -- Catherine.
Hello, Catherine. Pleasure to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nina was just telling me about you
and how you looked out for her here.
Thank you.
Well, you have a terrific daughter.
Yes, I do. I'm very proud of her.
We've been through a lot together and...
we can tell each other anything.
You know, the thing I admire most about her
is her honesty.
I'm sure you feel the same way about your son.
Okay, that's enough. I know what you're doing.
She knows we're dating.
I figured it out the moment I saw you two.
I told you. You know, these kids think we're stupid.
We ain't stupid.
But you know what?
I'm glad we got this little game out of the way.
That way, we can get to know each other better.
Yeah.
You don't mind if I grab Frankie for a little chat, do you?
Oh, no. Please. Take him.
Excuse us, dear. This is gonna take a while.
Let's go.
Oh, please.
I've been researching 1912 Bercotti shotguns.
They're a real rare prize for gun collectors,
'cause they only made about 500.
Well, there can't be a lot of those around.
No. Only 18 in the United States.
One was auctioned off in Boston seven months ago.
Guess who bought it.
I don't believe those belong to you.
I'll take them right now.
How did you know I was here?
My son can't keep anything from me.
Well, then you know that he asked me
to hold on to these documents.
And I have decided that it's best if I have them.
Why do you want them?
Let's just say they're important to my family.
Well, they're also important to whoever tried to kill your son.
And that person will not stop until they have them.
I just don't believe that these papers
are more important to you than your son's life.
I am trying to protect him.
So am I.
And I don't know what is going on here,
but I don't think that Edward had anything to do with it.
And I don't believe that you are a killer.
I can help you, but you're going to have to trust me.
That's Detective Rizzoli.
If I don't answer, she's gonna know that something is wrong.
I'll put it on speaker.
Okay?
Okay.
Jane, what's up?
We traced the shotgun to Noah Brenner.
It looks like he's our shooter.
Do you know why?
No, not yet.‬
But the answer has to be in those papers,‬
so we need them for motive.
I will bring them back to BPD.
Oh, we're gonna go pick up Brenner,
so we'll meet you back here.
Okay.
Now it all makes sense.
It was Noah who told Edward and me
not to talk to the police.
He was sure there was something in the documents
that would tarnish my husband's reputation
and destroy our business.
So he asked you to get the documents.
He said he would help me protect the firm.
It's obvious the only thing he was interested in protecting
was his own ass.
Well, whatever's in these papers,
he was willing to kill in order to keep secret.
Will you help me figure out what that is?
I'll try.
What's going on, Angela?
Um, I'm spying on Frankie.
I mean with you and me.
Uh, I -- I don't know what you mean.
Joann said she ran into you in the park.
Yeah, it was really nice to see her.
And she finally told me about the conversation
that you two had right after the shooting.
Okay.
And you broke up with me because of what she said.
Well, listen, Joann was just doing what she thought was best.
I don't give a damn what Joann thought.
Well, don't be mad at her.
I'm not. I'm mad at you.
Look, Joann has a right to feel any way she wants,
they're her feelings, not mine.
Okay.
And if my being with you‬
meant that I was at slightly more risk
of getting shot at, then so be it.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
I didn't know that.
So you broke up with me under false pretenses.
So I reject your breakup.
You do?
Yeah.
Unless you can stand there and honestly tell me
that you don't love me the way I love you.
You love me?
Yes.
I do.
Stop.
‭Any luck?‬
Tilly and I figured out what was going on.
How did you get Cruella de Vil to help?
I convinced her that we're on the same side.
What did you find out?
Well, after his father's death,
Edward couldn't figure out why his dad had written
large checks out of the family's account.
Tilly recognized that all the checks
went to clients that Phillip had put into Noah's hedge fund.
Why would he do that?
Tilly thinks there could be only one reason,
that Noah was running a Ponzi scheme.
So Phillip must have figured out what was going on.
And he was trying to pay back his clients with his own money.
But then Noah found out that Edward was looking into it,
and he had to stop him.
And Noah couldn't let people know what Edward's dad
was doing and shine too much light on his fund.‬
The only way to keep the Ponzi scheme going
was keep those documents secret.
Yeah, he killed a man to do it.
Are you bringing Noah in?
We went to his office, he wasn't there.
We're gonna try his estate, and see if we can find him.
Don't, he's right here.
Maura? Maura?! Are you all right?
I'm all right.
I'm all right.
The documents are all -- all over the floor.
Where are you?
Winchester Road,
just a couple of miles south of Edward's estate.
We're close.
All right, sit tight. We'll be right there.
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun!
Maura!
Hang on!‬
Stop right there!
I want those documents!
You shoot...
You shoot me, and they go right over the edge with me.
You'll never have time to retrieve them
before the police get here.
You're right. We can make a deal.
A deal?
Yeah, a mutually beneficial arrangement
between two reasonable people.
What do you have in mind?
You give me the documents, and I let you walk.
In order for an agreement like that to work,
there has to be trust between the parties involved.
What do you need me to do?
Make me understand how a smart man
gets involved in a Ponzi scheme.
What difference does it make?
It will help me judge just how desperate you are.
Why do you care?
Desperate people can't be trusted.
And we agreed that we need to trust each other.
People with my kind of money are never desperate.
We can buy our way out of anything.
Until you meet someone as rich as you.
Trust me, you're not as rich as me.
I was talking about Edward and his father.
You have the last set of documents.
So my plan is simple --
I either buy you or I kill you.
There's no other way out for you.
Or for you.
And there's no way I would ever make that kind of a deal.
It's over, Noah.
You've forced my hand.
At least I'll be able to run.
Put the gun down. Very slowly.
I don't want to shoot you, but I will.
Oh, we wouldn't want to scratch this beauty.
Where did you come from?
Well, those shotguns have hair triggers.
We parked around the corner,
figured the element of surprise was important.
Surprise.
You all right?
I am now.
Where's my mom?
Oh, she's downstairs, grabbing a cup of coffee.
She'll be right up.
Why are you smiling?
Because we really hit it off.
How is that possible?
Oh, so did you go with the dark roast?
‭It's great with the hazelnut cream. I really love that.‬
It is, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, right?
Okay, what's going on here?
I don't know what you're talking about, dear.
You're both standing here like it was fun and games.
Because we had a great time.
There is no way he could have stood up to your interrogation
and come out with that smile on his face.
I didn't interrogate him. We just had a lovely chat.
Yeah, she's right. It was nice, yeah.
Why didn't you ask him all the crazy-ass questions
you asked all of my other boyfriends?‬
Simple. I liked this one right off the bat.
Now, I wasn't crazy about the relationship deception
you two pulled, but...
I figured it was all your idea.
Hey, how about we all go out to dinner, huh?
That sounds good. Nina?
Yeah, I'd like that. Frankie, would you get my coat?
It's on my chair.
Sure.
You know I love you, right?
But if you screw up this relationship,
I will come down on you like a pack of hungry wolves.
I was about to say the same thing to you, sweetheart.
We good?
We're great.
Great.
Okay, so I'm thinking Vitello's.
I think that bump on your head has altered your thinking.
Uh, no, I'm serious. I think my mother actually likes you.
Tolerates is a more accurate description.
All right. Who would have thought
that we would end up here after all these years?
Life is unpredictable.
Yeah. I'll say.
So are you ready to come inside?
Are we really gonna do this, Maura?
It's been a long time. I don't think we have a choice.
All right.
The happy couple!
Oh, gosh! Look at this cake!
I know. Ma went all out.
Thank you.
Oh, sure.
So what do we do now?
Well, we can't have cake
until you sign the divorce papers, and -- and I want cake.
Yeah.
Cake.
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake!
Sign 'em, Maura. Ladies first.
Okay.
All right.
And by the powers not vested in me,
I pronounce you happily divorced.
Who knew a divorce party could be so much fun?
Let's never have one, okay?
Okay.
All right, you have to tell us all about Maura's wild years.
Come on.
Did she ever tell you about the time she tried out
to be a professional female wrestler?
You're kidding me.
WWF was in town.
It was her opportunity
to protest gender inequality
in popular culture.
I have to take notes.
No, seriously. She came up with a name.
Maura the Mauler. She had a costume.
What?!
You're so right.
This is the best way to celebrate a divorce.
Well...
you know, I figure a divorce should be
as much fun as the wedding.
Thank you for throwing the party.
Yeah, sure.
It's not every day that your best friend gets divorced.
You've decided to take the job,
haven't you?
Yes, I have.
I think it's the right thing to do.
I'm proud of you.
Really?
Yeah, I know change is hard.
And it's scary to face the unknown,
but we have more to do in our lives.
Yeah.
Thanks for supporting me.
That's what best friends do.
Here's to change.
To change.
And maybe collared shirts.
No! No, God, no!
That is never gonna happen --
not even at the Bureau.
Oh, but here's some good news.
Uh, the employee discount at the FBI in the gift shop --
25% off.
You know I can't resist a sale.
