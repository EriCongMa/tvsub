&quot; there &apos;s nothing else we can do for you . &quot;
these are the last words
a surgeon wants to tell a patient .
eight surgeons have said this is inoperable .
i mean , even the tumor board at cleveland clinic .
well , i can see why .
giving up doesn &apos;t come easy to us ,
so we do everything in our power not to .
catch .
what &apos;s this for ?
heads , we do it . tails , we don &apos;t .
you &apos;re insane .
it &apos;s a gut check .
i get a feeling when it &apos;s in the air .
but i really want to land on .
flip it .
for surgeons ,
&quot; lost cause &quot; just means &quot; try a little harder . &quot;
oh , damn it . i screwed it up .
&quot; gag zola , &quot; really ?
those aren &apos;t g &apos;s . those are y &apos;s for &quot; yay . &quot;
&quot; yay zola . &quot;
see , a normal person would &apos;ve just written &quot; happy birthday . &quot;
well , i couldn &apos;t fit all those letters on the cake .
okay , who used up the last of my deodorant ?
oh , that might have been me .
sorry . kinda had a workout last night .
not mine .
coffee .
fresh out , chief .
wait . n @-@ no .
that &apos;s impossible . i just bought some three days ago .
you &apos;re out of o.j. , too .
hey , you &apos;re still here ?
oh , yeah . i was on my way out ,
and then i saw these cheeks . so cute .
oh ! we don &apos;t touch the baby
because we don &apos;t know where those hands have been .
alex does .
okay , so , um , i have a meeting with owen ,
so i &apos;m off . party is at 8 : 00 . don &apos;t be late .
i got 20 minutes before work . you wanna , you know ?
yeah .
good . come on .
round two .
oh , we need to move .
do we ?
okay , take a look .
i took a little more off this time .
no , i love it . hey , look .
i want that . move .
oh , i &apos;ve got surgery in an hour ,
so we &apos;ll do you tomorrow .
and you i will see tonight at zola &apos;s party .
yes ?
love you .
see ya .
&quot; see ya &quot; ?
yeah . &quot; i love you , too &quot; is the appropriate response
to &quot; i love you . &quot;
yeah .
why wouldn &apos;t you--
we &apos;ve been dating three months .
it &apos;s way too early for that .
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no . this is classic mark .
he found out lexie and jackson broke up ,
and now he &apos;s suddenly getting cold feet about julia .
you and lexie are over , okay ?
that ship has sailed ... and sank .
this has nothing to do with lexie .
uh @-@ huh .
okay , i &apos;m gonna take sofia to day care .
come here , honey .
hello . yes , my little baby girl .
i love you .
bye . i love you , too .
morning , dr. webber .
morning . dr. webber .
how are you ?
dr. bailey .
congratulations , sir .
big day today .
yes , it is , but--but i don &apos;t want everybody
making a big deal out of it .
we won &apos;t .
good . i @-@ i @-@ i mean , you &apos;ll-- you &apos;ll do something ?
yes .
i @-@ i mean , it is my 10,000th surgery .
that &apos;s a lot of surgeries .
i &apos;ve reserved the main conference room .
there will be a photographer from the hospital newsletter .
the cake is your favorite red velvet and cream cheese .
yes .
it is huge-- the size of four cakes .
there will be several speeches from admiring colleagues
and a toast with sparkling cider .
we will also hang a banner that says
&quot; congratulations , dr. webber on your 10,000th surgery ! ! ! &quot;
there will be three exclamation points after the word &quot; surgery . &quot;
we also have confetti .
happy now ?
yes .
oh , e @-@ except for the confetti .
might get in the cake .
oh , take a seat , grey .
okay , so i know i haven &apos;t logged a lot of o.r. time lately ,
but i &apos;ve been getting a routine down with zola ,
and i &apos;ve got it under control now , so i &apos;m all set .
is that it ?
you still haven &apos;t declared a specialty .
i know . uh , it &apos;s a really big decision ,
and i have been thinking about it .
you ditched neuro , you wasted time in o.b. ,
you &apos;re my only fifth year
who doesn &apos;t know where they &apos;re going .
you &apos;re drowning , grey .
drowning is a strong word .
how about general ?
you &apos;ve been helping bailey with the diabetes trial ,
and webber &apos;s always been a mentor ,
not to mention your mother .
she was one of the best general surgeons
this country &apos;s ever seen .
with that legacy , you could be a natural .
how did you repair it that fast ?
well , it was luck more than anything else .
he could &apos;ve gone into pulmonary edema .
no , it wasn &apos;t luck . you were in the zone .
that was amazing .
dr. altman , um ...
it &apos;s lasagna .
and this is a spinach pie .
oh , that &apos;s--that &apos;s so sweet . thank you .
it means a lot to me .
more widow casserole .
&quot; your husband &apos;s dead . have some food . &quot;
what is that ?
you know what ? i &apos;ll put it with the others .
oh , hey . how &apos;d the surgery go ?
i &apos;ll see you in the pit .
glad to see she &apos;s not mad at me anymore .
she &apos;s very busy .
we just did a mitral valve repair without bypass ,
and she threw , like , 25 stitches in 10 seconds .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it .
how long &apos;s it been since you slept ?
i had a huge nap . whatever .
i &apos;ve done , like , 8 surgeries in the past 72 hours .
teddy &apos;s boundless grief is , you know ,
one of the best things that &apos;s ever happened to me .
what is that ... is that trauma or administrative crap ?
no , none of your business . go home and get some sleep .
oh , trauma .
hey , hey . no , cristina ...
take that . hey .
i was paged here . i already ordered the c.t.
he &apos;s my patient .
this isn &apos;t finders keepers .
i &apos;m taking over the patient .
what do we got ?
back off , yang . i met the ambulance .
everyone , take a breath . what happened ?
a 32 year old ran his bike into a wrought iron fence .
yeah , and this is the fence going directly into his heart .
i know how to deal with these injuries .
he &apos;s my patient .
i can remove it thoracoscopically .
yeah , and that &apos;s when the poor guy dies
because if you do that , you won &apos;t have a direct visual .
plenty of people use the vats technique to remove impaled objects .
oh , now you &apos;re the expert ?
you don &apos;t get every cardio case , yang .
enough , all of you .
mcqueen is the doctor on call . he can handle it .
karev , you will assist .
altman , i believe today is your day off .
go get some rest .
dr. altman has way more experience ,
and this is gonna be a complicated procedure .
well , both of you have been up for the past 48 hours straight .
this is a liability issue . hands off the patient .
dr. altman ?
fine .
enjoy your nap .
his neuroblastoma is more complicated than most i &apos;ve seen .
it &apos;s very rare that someone his age ...
they &apos;re mostly in younger kids , i know .
it &apos;s in a very large region of his spine .
there is the very likely risk of paralysis ..
... from his upper body down .
there &apos;s also the risk of death ,
a death that he is gonna meet
in three months anyway if you don &apos;t do this surgery .
i understand the risks , dr. shepherd .
the surgeon in ... in boston compared it to
dismantling a bomb with your eyes closed ,
and the one in chicago said it was
patching a dam with gum .
you &apos;re the ninth surgeon i &apos;ve talked to .
so what i want to know
is , are you gonna say anything different ,
or do i have to take my kid somewhere else ?
there is only a 5 % chance of success .
maybe a little less .
yes , if you &apos;re willing , i &apos;ll try .
okay . should i go tell wes ?
wait . um ... there &apos;s something else .
he ... he doesn &apos;t know about his tumor .
he &apos;s 11 , a young 11,
and knowing that he &apos;s very likely gonna die
is not something that &apos;s gonna do him any good .
wh @-@ why does he think he &apos;s here ?
a backache .
a very bad backache .
hey , dr. bailey .
chief hunt says i need to declare a specialty .
he suggested general .
good for you . mini ellis grey .
no . i &apos;m still on the fence about it .
because there are a lot of specialties out there ...
don &apos;t be an idiot . it &apos;s in your genes , grey .
it makes perfect sense .
oh , uh , karen and marcy ,
i &apos;d like you to meet dr. bailey and dr. grey .
they &apos;ll be performing the liver transplant with me today .
nice to meet you .
this i.v. really hurts .
you think it could be infected ?
i mean , i &apos;m already missing my family vacation for this .
i &apos;d ... i &apos;d hate to die of staph .
you &apos;re not gonna die , marcy .
i am the one in liver failure .
it doesn &apos;t look infected .
a little discomfort is normal .
thank you . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m just nervous .
i &apos;ve never had a major surgery before .
but when your sister calls you to come and save her life ,
i mean , you take that call .
how lucky i am to have just that sister .
yes , you are .
well , the labs look good .
we &apos;re ready for transplant .
in the meantime , why don &apos;t we relax ?
relax in a hospital ?
it &apos;d be a lot easier on a white , sandy beach .
i &apos;m gonna reimburse you for this trip . i promise .
i just hope i don &apos;t die in there .
i mean , it would be hard to reimburse me for my life .
thank you , marcy .
i just can &apos;t thank you enough .
oh , well , you &apos;re welcome .
fort ticonderoga is probably my favorite .
it &apos;s not giant like gettysburg or famous like the alamo .
you feel any pain here , wes ?
a little .
still , it was a really important fort .
it changed hands a bunch of times in just a few years .
benedict arnold even fought there .
he &apos;s got a thing about battlefields .
i see that . hey , relax .
my mom says i get it from my dad .
he died when i was 2 .
we &apos;ve gone to 18 battlefields in the past year .
we homeschool because of the back pain .
it &apos;s so cool . i wake up , and we get to decide
what i do that day .
next week , we &apos;re going to pearl harbor .
that way , my mom can have a beach vacaon , too .
actually , wes , we may be postponing hawaii .
dr. shepherd thinks he might be able to fix your back .
really ? then i won &apos;t have these aches anymore ?
well , that &apos;s the plan .
what about ortho ? callie would be a great mentor .
bones ?
oncology .
depressing .
trauma .
i &apos;ve had enough trauma for one lifetime .
well , just pick something . this decision is important .
check it .
fence guy ... heart &apos;s the size of a football .
from hitting a fence ?
from being impaled on a fence .
don &apos;t worry , yang .
i &apos;ll send you pics from the surgery .
hey , is it too late for me to pick cardio ?
yes . cardio &apos;s mine .
you don &apos;t have to do this , you know ?
i want to .
he &apos;s the chief of surgery .
and that heart is the size of a football .
oh , oh , he &apos;s leaving .
okay , go .
go now .
mrs. vanderburg , i &apos;m dr. yang .
and i &apos;m--i &apos;m so sorry to hear about your husband &apos;s accident .
are you one of his doctors ?
oh , i &apos;m not , but i &apos;m familiar with his case ,
and i just wanted to assure you
that everyone here is doing everything they can for him .
that &apos;s so nice .
i &apos;m sure they &apos;ve assembled a @-@ a wonderful group of surgeons .
dr. altman really is the best there is .
w @-@ wait . no .
i don &apos;t think they mentioned an altman .
no , they said something about a dr. mcqueen .
is that right ? is he good , too ?
dr. mcqueen ?
oh , uh , sure . he &apos;s-- he &apos;s fine .
fine ?
well , he &apos;s--he &apos;s an experienced surgeon ,
but he &apos;s not the head of the department .
dr ... dr. altman is the head of the department .
you know , i ...
with the extent of your husband &apos;s injuries ,
i just ... look , i just assumed she was on the case .
but ...
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
dr. altman probably wasn &apos;t available anyway .
she &apos;s very busy these days ...
saving lives .
you swam with the dolphins ?
kaylee swam with the dolphins .
okay , honey .
mommy needs to go save aunt karen &apos;s life now .
oh , bye @-@ bye , sweetie . i love you , too .
i am risking my life here .
it &apos;s not like a ride to the airport .
oh , believe me , after this ,
i will never ask you for a ride to the airport .
i will never ask you for anything again .
what is that supposed to mean ?
just need a little blood here .
because i am never gonna hear the end of it .
you &apos;re gonna lord this stupid piece of liver over me
until we &apos;re both dead , just like everything else .
one more tube , and i &apos;ll be out of your hair .
everything else ,
like all the checks i sent ...
or the jobs i lined up ?
you managed to get yourself fired from most of those .
and i have never asked you for anything in return .
oh , no , just my lips glued to your ass 24 / 7 .
you know what ? keep your damn liver . ohh !
oh , here we go .
you know , i have no job , no husband , no kids .
you won , okay ?
so just , hey , forget the transplant .
just--you &apos;re--you &apos;re off the hook . you &apos;re off the hook .
catch your plane to maui ,
swim with your precious dolphin--
karen , what hurts ?
don &apos;t worry .
when i &apos;m winning the fight ,
she doesn &apos;t feel good .
i &apos;m in liver failure .
classic drama queen .
i need some f.f.p. and octreotide in here !
there &apos;s bleeding in the veins
at the bottom of your esophagus .
that &apos;s a symptom of late @-@ stage liver failure .
you have surgery in a couple of hours .
you have to try not to get worked up between now and then .
i told dr. grey , i &apos;m not having the surgery .
i want to go back on the transplant list .
there &apos;s no time for that , karen .
when these symptoms start , we can &apos;t wait any longer .
karen , you &apos;re going to die .
don &apos;t be stupid .
okay , enough from you .
fine .
i &apos;ll take her liver .
thank god .
honestly , the things you put our family through .
i &apos;ll call harry and the kids .
they &apos;ll be so thrilled you &apos;ve chosen life .
you got it ?
yeah . okay .
here you go .
here we go .
did the tumor grow more ?
what did you say ?
i know what i have .
i overheard some doctors talking about it
at the last hospital .
does your mom know that you know ?
no . she &apos;d just freak out .
she &apos;s your mom . she needs to know .
she cries in the bathroom .
she cries at night .
she cries in the morning when she thinks i &apos;m not awake yet .
she cries all the time .
and the only thing that makes her happy
is to think that i don &apos;t know .
you can &apos;t tell her .
if i &apos;m happy ,
she &apos;s happy .
i promise i won &apos;t tell .
you &apos;re not lying ?
i &apos;m not lying .
do you think i &apos;m gonna die ?
i &apos;ve worked with dr. shepherd for a while now ,
and your mom could not have picked a better doctor for you .
he &apos;s the best .
well , this one has a patio and a garage ,
but this one has hardwood floors and a washer / dryer .
you sure you want to move ?
uh , meredith and derek have a baby ,
and you &apos;re living with your ex . we &apos;re moving .
i &apos;ll move . zola &apos;s killing my game .
every girl i bring home wants a baby
the minute they see her .
no . i &apos;m not living with you .
i am trying to get away from you .
all right , then you and me .
you don &apos;t want to live with mary poppins .
喜欢引人向善
no , she cooks , she cleans--
i &apos;m also your friend .
what the hell ?
i need food for zola &apos;s party .
i thought i was gonna have time to go to the store ,
but richard &apos;s 10,000th surgery is gonna take forever .
you think teddy &apos;s gonna care if i take
some of her widow casseroles ?
no . go for it . you know what ? take this one , too .
it &apos;s turkey tetrazzini .
ooh , yum .
you and um ... mcqueen finally find a patient
who &apos;s willing to let you operate on them ?
bite my ass .
oh , mer , proctology .
there &apos;s your specialty .
explore the mysteries of the butt .
why aren &apos;t you just doing general like your mom ?
it &apos;s a no @-@ brainer .
and good marketing .
i mean , when people hear the name &quot; grey , &quot;
they know they &apos;re getting quality .
no , you can &apos;t win following in the footsteps of a phenom .
said the lame , mediocre grandson of harper avery .
hello , julia .
what is this ?
she &apos;s you . you &apos;re julia . go with it .
you know , i &apos;ve been thinking ,
it &apos;s been a really great few months ,
and i just want you to know that i love you .
get out of my relationship .
funny coming from you .
what &apos;s your problem ? she &apos;s smart and pretty
and funny and--
and she &apos;s not annoying .
mm @-@ hmm .

we can all vacation together .
we can buy houses next door to each other .
yay .
yeah , and sofia can have a village . yes .
don &apos;t you want your daughter to have a village ?
come on . you know you love her .
now you just need to tell her .
who do you love--julia ?
hey .

i love your hair . how are you ?
yeah , i &apos;m--i &apos;m good . thanks .
so what &apos;s going on with julia ?

you know , weird ?
yeah .
all right , sir , are you smiling ?
i &apos;m wearing a mask .
i &apos;m not sure it matters .

of my 10,000th surgery ?
oh , you &apos;re sure we shouldn &apos;t just send an intern--
handle it , kepner .

and that &apos;s great , thanks .
thank you .
cristina ?
what are you still doing here ?
i &apos;m , uh , gonna watch a surgery .
derek &apos;s , um , tumor thing .
you need sleep .
yeah , i &apos;m watching neurosurgery .
it &apos;s a lot like sleeping .
you &apos;re not mad that i gave the case to mcqueen ?
uh , i didn &apos;t say that .
and teddy , she--
owen ...
i know , i know , you don &apos;t want to talk about it .
what do i do ? how do i ...
get past this with her ?
her husband &apos;s dead . she &apos;s taking it out on you .
you just gotta deal with it .
i know , i know , but i just wish that ...
you know what ? never mind .
i &apos;m talking to you when i should just try to talk to her .
mm @-@ hmm .
see you at the party ?
yeah .
okay .
somebody paged dr. webber .
he &apos;s in the middle of a transplant .
yes , over there .
mrs. webber ?
where is my husband ?
do you know where he is ?
i-- i @-@ i found her out on the street .
she was trying to walk here .
i-- i live next door to the webbers . it &apos;s 7 miles away .
oh , god .
where is he ? i want you to go find him right now !
yeah , i @-@ i will go find your husband .
would you just stand here ,
just for one moment , please ?
um , could you just stay with her
till i can talk to dr. webber and figure out what to do ?
i can try . she &apos;s pretty insistent .
okay , well , uh , i have an office on the third floor .
if you could just ...
what ? wait . m-- wait . mrs. webber ?
oh , no .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
oh , mrs. webber , there you are .
um , w--
i don &apos;t understand .
what &apos;s going on ? where are richard &apos;s things ?
yeah , i @-@ i know this must be very confusing be--
this used to be richard &apos;s office , but now he &apos;s--
he--he &apos;s gone ? he left me ?
no . no , no , no . he &apos;s just-- he &apos;s in surgery right now .
it &apos;s-- he-- it &apos;s his 10,000th surgery .
he &apos;s always wanted to leave me for her .
he finally did .
no .
he never loved me . never !
oh , god .
it was always her .
and now he &apos;s gone ?
and he just left ?
he didn &apos;t even tell me where . he &apos;s just gone .
no , okay , mrs. webber , i
ju-- i need you to please try and--
just try and calm down ...
i can &apos;t do it alone .
i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t do it alone .
please , richard , don &apos;t leave me .
richard , i can &apos;t do it alone . i can &apos;t .
it &apos;s all right .
transect the parenchyma .
watch the aspirator , grey .
got it .
nice . nice technique .
well , you &apos;ve certainly got your mother &apos;s hands .
don &apos;t get too excited .
i haven &apos;t declared anything yet .
well , what else are you gonna do--neuro , cardio ?
you want to waste your talent
playing with one little predictable organ
for the rest of your life ?
nah , i &apos;d rather spend my days
leaping from the liver to the pancreas to the stomach
to the bowel ,
and any one could go wrong at anytime .
okay , sure . there &apos;s nothing wrong with knowing one organ
and knowing it well ,
just like there &apos;s nothing wrong with being fifth @-@ chair viola
in the back of the orchestra .
but it &apos;s a hell of a lot more fun being the conductor .
now ...
this ...
goes to the chief .
are they ready ?
yeah , but i can give you a few more minutes , though .
no , we &apos;re ready .
uh , wes , time to put the computer away .
you ... are gonna be okay .
and the doctors are gonna take really good care of you .
mom , don &apos;t cry .
you know me . i cry when you leave for a sleepover .
well don &apos;t .
dr. shepherd &apos;s the best .
you &apos;re right ,
as usual .
give me a hug .
oh , you &apos;re still here .
listen , i know you don &apos;t want to talk to me ,
but this has gone on too long .
now i understand why , at least ...
i want to .
we need to talk .
can we just talk ?
now is not a good time .
teddy . hey--
don &apos;t !
it &apos;s wrapped around more of the vessels
than the scan showed .
what do you think , dr. grey ?
think we should start with , uh , t @-@ 4 ?
yeah , i , uh , i still think that &apos;s the best approach .
there &apos;s no clear prevertebral plane .
all right , well , take me through it , step @-@ by @-@ step .
okay , we get up above t @-@ 3 , maybe t @-@ 2,
we get control of the aorta proximally ,
and then dissect the large vessels free .
we preserve the radicular branches as we go ,
especially adamkiewicz--
he &apos;s paralyzed if we go anywhere near the adamkiewicz .
we don &apos;t get this tumor , this surgery is for nothing .
right .
so ... we go in far lateral instead ?
are you asking me or telling me ?
i &apos;m telling .
i mean , um , we could mobilize the great vessels ,
and that way , we get access to the tumor on both sides .
can i get some suction in here ?
i &apos;ve attached the hepatic veins .
now i &apos;m reconstructing the portal vein .
he left me . he left me . i don &apos;t want to see him working .
no-- he &apos;slways working .
no , no , he didn &apos;t leave you . he &apos;s right there .
see ?
oh , he &apos;s with that woman ?
you tell that woman to go away .
that &apos;s my husband not hers .
richard !
dr. webber .
richard , why are you doing this to me , to us ?
adele ?
you lied .
you said that you weren &apos;t working with her anymore .
dr. webber ,
i @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t know what to do .
ellis ! you let him go .
um , dr. webber , do you want me to--
no , no , keep the line open .
adele ...
that &apos;s not ellis , adele .
what kind of woman would break up a marriage ?
huh ? ellis grey ,
what kind of woman are you ?
i &apos;m sorry .
well , i @-@ i should just scrub out .
no , no , i need the extra hands .
i will not have you downhere with my husband .
do you hear me ? i will not have it .
richard , you just send her away .
adele ...
i &apos;m right here .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
richard !
tell her something that &apos;ll ground her--
a happy memory .
richard !
a happy memory , it worked for my mom .
richard !
richard .
richard .
richard , you need to come outta there .
richard .
it &apos;s our wedding day .
you were the most beautiful bride i &apos;ve ever seen .
oh , richard .
and for our first dance , they played
&lt; i &gt; my funny valentine &lt; / i &gt; .
because we &apos;re getting married on valentine &apos;s day .
happy valentine &apos;s day , baby .
i love you .
i love you , too .
tell bailey to cancel the party .
so once the vertebrectomies are complete ,
we take the tumor down off the dura ,
do a myelotomy--
and again hit the adamkiewicz .
paralyzed , dead in three months .
we resect it free from the aorta--
spinal shock . dead .
harvest a radicular branch
that doesn &apos;t have tumor involvement--
dead again .
okay , stop saying that .
dr. grey .
no , we told him that we would try .
you &apos;re not even trying .
because the surgery will kill him .
we have no choice . we have to close him up .
no .
dr. grey , i think it &apos;s time you just--
no , you &apos;re quitting .
okay , it &apos;s--it &apos;s not right , not when we said
that we would try .
there &apos;s a 5 % chance . we--we owe him--
there is no longer a 5 % chance .
gelfoam , please .
no .
he knows about the tumor .
he has known all along .
i t--i ...
i told him that we would try .
i told him that you were the best .
now please , derek , just ...
please .
leave the o.r. , right now .
all right . let &apos;s close him up .
no party ?
canceled . help yourself to cake .
karev , why aren &apos;t you still in mcqueen &apos;s surgery ?
oh , uh , altman and , uh , yang took that .
what ?
i could be wrong .
you have to tell him .
but i thought he already knew .
no , about the tumor ,
not that we didn &apos;t do the surgery .
his--his mom &apos;s not gonna tell him ,
and he &apos;s gonna wake up ,
and she &apos;s gonna tell him that it all went great ,
and he &apos;s gonna go home thinking that we did the surgery ,
not that he &apos;s gonna die in three months .
you need to tell him .
she &apos;s the parent .
it is not our call .
i &apos;m sorry , no .
we can &apos;t tell him anything .
that looks more like a heart . right ?
what are you doing ?
mcqueen wasn &apos;t qualified .
i think i was clear in the e.r.
yeah , i &apos;m head of the department . i made the call .
put another pledgeted suture right here .
right here between these two ?
yeah , but closer to the atrium .
you should &apos;ve informed me .
there wasn &apos;t time .
dr. yang stopped and had a nice little chat with me
a couple of hours ago on her way to what i believe
is this procedure .
and then i spoke to you , and you--
well , we didn &apos;t know that we were doing the surgery then .
i think you &apos;re lying to me . both of you .
you know what ? this is a fairly complicated procedure .
can we get into this later ?
shall we do an intraoperative echo ?
yes . why don &apos;t you pull it over ?
find me when you &apos;re finished , doctor .
did you see that throbbing vein ...
in his forehead ?
i have the hardest time keeping a straight face
when it pops up .
and the ...
the surgery wasn &apos;t as hard as they first thought ,
which is good .
&apos;cause that means we can make it to ,
to hawaii , now .
you &apos;re done .
no more surgeries or doctors .
that &apos;s it . it &apos;s just us .
and we &apos;re gonna go on another trip after that , too .
maybe even normandy , like we said .
doesn &apos;t that sound fun ?
you didn &apos;t do it .
what ?
you said , after the surgery ,
i &apos;d be stuck in here for a few weeks .
that &apos;s right . i did .
you know , sometimes when we get in there ,
things change .
that &apos;s why you get to go home .
which is a good thing .
honey ...
it &apos;s all gonna be fine .
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
mommy &apos;s gonna make sure of it .
and you don &apos;t have to worry .
i promise .
you &apos;re gonna be okay , too .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
i &apos;m gonna be with dad in heaven .
how &apos;d it go ?
great . you are the proud new owner
of a fully functioning liver .
thank god .
don &apos;t thank god . thank me .
i &apos;ll never be able to wear a two @-@ piece again .
it &apos;s a horrible scar .
i have thanked you , marcy ,
about a million times .
okay , enough . we &apos;re not gonna do this again .
but it doesn &apos;t seem to make a difference .
you just don &apos;t get it .
so i &apos;m done .
excuse me ?
i am done thanking you .
you are not allowed to mention
your extradinary generosity anymore ,
except once a year on thanksgiving .
okay , you &apos;re gonna hurt yrself .
and on that night , i will thank you .
but if you don &apos;t flow my rules--
oh , there are rules ?
yes . i will have to bring up
everything about you
that i have happily chosen to not mention ,
like how you &apos;ve lost thousands of dollars
in that lipstick selling ponzi scheme .
that &apos;s none of your business .
oh , and how sometimes , when you &apos;re drunk and sad ,
you &quot; sext &quot; your college boyfriend .
you wouldn &apos;t .
yes , i would , which is why
you will not mention my liver ever again .
my liver is dead to you !
fine .
your liver &apos;s dead to me .
what about the money you owe me ?
enough ! enough ! both of you , stop talking .
she is ...
i @-@ i mean it .
so-- you are in a time @-@ out ,
especially you .
no more talking .
you can &apos;t talk to me like this .
this is ridic--
he &apos;s still in serious condition ,
so i &apos;ll be staying the night to monitor him .
actually , i &apos;ll stay with him tonight .
really ?
the head of the department ?
i &apos;m happy to do it .
oh , thank you .
i can stay with you .
your zola &apos;s godmother . you have to go to her birthday party .
besides , i &apos;m just gonna stay here
and eat widow casserole , feel sorry for myself .
go . out .
okay .
happy birthday .
hey , girl .
look who didn &apos;t just wake up ?
look at you .
you look so beautiful . look at that bow .
you made it .
of course .
adele insisted i didn &apos;t miss little miss zola &apos;s party .
so she &apos;s feeling better then ?
much . the night nurse is with her .
she was already asleep when i left .
and this is for the guest of honor .
how are you doing , little miss zola ?
you look very pretty for your birthday .
yes , you do .
i need 800 bucks .
told you , if you &apos;re dumb enough to buy groceries ,
i &apos;m gonna eat &apos; em .
no , not for groceries . for a security deposit .
we &apos;ll lose out on a really great 3 @-@ bedroom
if we don &apos;t get it to the landlord today .
now you want to live with me ?
no , you &apos;re gross
and a pig and a skank magnet
and you leave your dirty boy socks everywhere .
keep going this way , and you &apos;ll wind up old and alone ,
wandering the streets
with some ancient form of syphilis .
all right , i think what she &apos;s trying to say is ,
yes , she would be happy if you &apos;d be our roommate .
cool .
so ... we couldn &apos;t afford
the nice apartment just the two of us , right ?
hardwood floors and a washer / dryer .
what can i say ? i want what i want .
she &apos;ll forgive us , right ?
well , she won &apos;t remember anything .
a picture , right ?
yeah , picture . yes .
here we go . here we go .
happy birthday .
happy birthday .
perfect .
dada .
guys , the cake .
oh , oh , the cake .
happy 10,000th , dr. webber .
oh , for me ? no .
come on . it &apos;s--it &apos;s not every day you get to celebrate
10,000 surgeries .
thanks .
very nicely done , sir .
hey , the dress you guys got zola ?
she loved it . she loved it .
sofia loved it , too .
didn &apos;t you love it , mark ?
it was adorable .
what can i say ? i have great taste .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna get a refill . anyone ?
oh , i would love a glass of red .
enough of that .
oh , mark .
you two are the ones that love her .
it &apos;s like you want to take her behind a mini @-@ mart ,
knock her up , and have all her babies .
oh , my god . you guys would have such beautiful babies .
well , then sofia would have a sibling .
except i &apos;m not there yet .
she &apos;s great ,
and i &apos;m happy you all get along ,
but i &apos;m not rushing this .
i rushed it with addison .
i tried to force lexie to be a grandmother , for god sakes .
i &apos;m not doing that again .
that is so adult .
you know what auntie cristina did today ?
i operated on a heart
this b--actually , no . that &apos;s not--
this big .
this big .
it was as big as a bear .
they &apos;re not called lost causes because they &apos;re fun .
i don &apos;t need them to be fun .
i just need them to not be like today .
okay .
let &apos;s flip .
heads , you keep doing lost causes .
tails , you can do the fun stuff .
i &apos;m in . of course i &apos;m in .
good .
come on . let &apos;s go join the party .
okay .
i know you &apos;re mad , and i &apos;m sorry .
sorry that you did it or you &apos;re sorry that i &apos;m mad ?
teddy never came to find me after surgery .
yeah , well , she &apos;s tired .
i bet .
i &apos;m taking you off her service
permanently .
i &apos;m not sure what she &apos;s gonna do
without you as her security blanket--
absolutely not .
well , this is the downside--
did you hear what i just said ? absolutely not .
i think &quot; thank you &quot; is what you were looking for ,
because frankly ,
i could &apos;ve fired you both .
you have no idea what &apos;s going on here , do you ?
i have a very good idea .
you let me operate on her husband ,
and now he &apos;s dead .
she gets whatever she wants . do you understand ?
anything she wants from me , ever .
i heard the good news .
bailey says you &apos;re declaring general .
actually , i &apos;m not sure anymore .
oh . oh , i ... thought it was a done deal .
i mean , it makes sense since you &apos;re--
because of my mother . i know . don &apos;t you mention her , too .
that &apos;s all anyone ever says--
it &apos;s in my blood , it &apos;s my legacy .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t want to do it .
i don &apos;t want to be like my mother .
meredith , look at everything you did today--
this party for your daughter ,
what you did for me in that o.r ..
you don &apos;t have to ever worry
about being anything like your mother .
i knew her ,
and you &apos;re nothing like your mother .
you have a gift .
don &apos;t waste it .
it was an impossible situation .
yes , and it was your call .
you put henry on my table .
and then you had me lie to teddy just like you did .
those were your decisions .
yeah , you want to be chief ?
these are the consequences .
don &apos;t talk to me about consequences .
you can &apos;t even accept a simple punishment
for what you did today .
you don &apos;t get to punish me .
okay ? it &apos;s not my fault teddy hates you .
but don &apos;t take your guilt out on me .
guilt ? i do--
i have nothing to be guilty about . this is all about you .
it &apos;s always been about you . it &apos;s what you want .
that &apos;s always been your position .
we live like you want , how you want .
you get whatever you want , all the time !
when do you throw in the towel ,
admit that a lost cause is sometimes just that ?
hey , um , do you remember your first surgery ?
well , sure , sure . i was a third @-@ year resident .
third year &apos;s could take
the lead on surgeries .
this isn &apos;t about me !
it is !
it &apos;s about how you constantly ignore me !
a gallbladder .
constantly ! you do what works for you .
you don &apos;t care who you crush in the process ...
there comes a point when it all becomes too much ...
or who gets hurt !
it was one surgery .
okay ? it was one surgery .
it was not one surgery ! do you hear me ?
this was every choice we &apos;ve made in the last--
it was--it was a life that i envisioned for myself , okay ?
this is not one surgery .
when we get too tired to fight anymore .
so we give up .
it all comes back to this ?
yeah .
crazy , right ? that i would ever bring it up again .
okay . yes , okay ? yes . yes !
okay , it was a horrible situation ,
but it &apos;s over .
is it too much to ask that we just try and forget it ?
you killed our baby ! you don &apos;t ever forget that !
that &apos;s when the real work begins ...
to find hope where there seems to be
