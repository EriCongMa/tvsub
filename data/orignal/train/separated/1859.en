Callie! Callie! Callie!
The brain is the human body's most mysterious organ.
It learns...
It changes...
And it adapts.
It tells us what we see...
what we hear.
It lets us feel love.
I think it holds our soul.
Callie! Oh, Callie! Help!
Help! Somebody call 9-1-1! Help! Oh! Oh, no.
What should we--
Go! Help me! Help! I need an ambulance...
But now matter how much research we do...
no one can really say how all the delicate gray matter
inside our skull works.
and when it's hurt...
when the human brain is traumatized...
Well...
That's when it gets even more mysterious.

I'm sorry, but suck it up.
What's her status?
She's in S.V.T. I gave her adenosine and some diltiazem,
but...
Go. Take a break. I got it.
Dr. Montgomery, uh, there's a chance
the baby could survive if we deliver by c-section
while Callie is stable.
No, there's not,
because not only did you fail to stop her contractions,
you didn't give steroids to the baby
to help mature her lungs, so you can go, too.
Go.
Oh, sweetie.
I'm so sorry.
But don't you worry. We got this.
The attendings, we are all gonna meet
and we are gonna come up with a plan.
I promise you. We're gonna make a plan,
and we're gonna figure out what to do.
It's gonna be all right.

She has got a hole in her heart.
She needs bypass to fix it, and she needs it now.
Bypass would mean a lot of heparin.
It is a setup for a rebleed.

She didn't respond?
She opened her eyes
and, um...
Look, it's just too soon to tell.
Derek, did she follow commands?
Anything else?
No, nothing else.
These are Dr. Burke's ex-patients.
Both stab wounds to the chest,
both presented after their initial surgeries with D.O.E..
Now he fixed both of them percutaneously,
which drastically reduces the amount of heparin needed.
So we could avoid the brain rebleeding,
and we don't need hypothermia,
so the baby would have a better chance--
Callie has a cardiac contusion, not penetrating trauma.
This is different.
Yeah, but I read cases where it worked in blunt trauma.
Well, I have seen every cardiac structure sheared off
by the wire in the loop in that procedure.
Dr. Burke uses a technique
that doesn't require the formation of a loop.
By placing an extra-stiff wire
deep into the pulmonary artery,
we avoided that complication.
Even if that's the case,
there's embolization and hemolysis--
which all could be avoided
with a meticulous delivery technique.
It's genius.
No.
What?
I'm saying no. It's too risky in this case.
The chances that we could puncture her heart are too high.
No, I did the surgery with Burke.
I mean, he taught me.
If you're unfamiliar with the technique,
I can show you operative reports.
This discussion is over.
Owen?
I am head of cardio, not your husband.
I am not asking my husband.
I'm asking the person in charge of Callie's case.
Dr. Hunt?
I'm sorry, but...

We've done everything we can.
Now we just have to wait for her to wake up.
But the fact that she barely responded
when you weaned her off the paralytics before?
Could mean she wasn't ready to wake up.
Or?
Or it could mean her brain has been compromised,
and she's not going to wake up.
You're not nothing.
We have a kid together.
You're a mom.
I'm a dad.
I'm sorry.
She's gonna wake up.
She has to wake up.
Yesterday at the baby shower...
I was jealous of Callie
because e got pregnant...
without trying.
And we try.
I get shots, I take my temperature,
I put my legs in the air, and nothing.
The universe says "Screw you, Meredith,"
and gives Callie a kid...
And then puts Callie through a windshield.
I mean, what the hell is going on?
What's the point?
I mean, is there a reason for this?
Because if you can think of a reason,
any reason at all,
why the universe is so screwed up...
and random and mean,
now would be an amazingly good time to tell me,
because I really need some answers.
I know. I know. I know. Come here.
I know.
Listen...
I will make sure we have a baby. I promise you.
One way or another,
you and I will be parents. I promise you.
Okay?
She's--she's really small.
But she's strong.
She's 1 pound, 1 ounce of... Strong.
Fighting against all the... complications.
She's got beautiful black hair, Calliope, beautiful hair.
She's--she's beautiful.
She can't open her eyes yet,
But I can tell...
she's looking for you.
Okay?
She's asking for you.

Look...
I am not the kind of guy that waits around
for the girl who's still in love with someone else.
I'm just not.
Jackson...
Let's go home.
And let's put her on a low dose of dopamine.
Oh, Dr. Altman.
Um, is there...
Did you have anything you wanted to add?
I can't teach you anymore.
Wh-what?
If you refuse to learn, if you won't listen,
I can't teach you.
I'm--I'm sorry. What--
Find someone else to learn from.
