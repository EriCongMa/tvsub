lorraine .
there you are .
i &apos;m sorry that i &apos;m late .
i was about to call you .
i should know better than to keep a beautiful woman waiting .
oh laying it on thick aren &apos;t you ?
oh i &apos;ve been looking forward to this .
got a prospectus for you .
food first .
do you like crab louie ?
i do .
it is so good here .
they use stone crab fresh from the bay .
the filet is wonderful
if you &apos;re in the mood for meat or the osso bucco .
henry .
hello .
sorry . um ... my head is still at work
making sure i deposited a check for a client .
well i &apos;m a client too .
and you &apos;re on my time now .
you have my full attention .
i better .
i have something you want .
this is all you have on him ?
we have the back of his head from a few cctv angles
nothing that helps .
he &apos;s careful to avoid being seen on camera .
out of all my cases this guy was never flagged
as top priority
but this murder changes everything .
you were right to call us .
we &apos;ll explain why .
everyone this is agent russell goldman
from the san diego white collar team .
you &apos;ve already met agent hotchner .
these are agents rossi morgan
prentiss and reid .
a pleasure .
so we &apos;re working a white collar case ?
not exactly .
i &apos;ve been following a con artist for 5 years .
two nights ago i think he killed someone .
carla marshall of miami was found dead in her home .
asphyxiation by strangulation .
she also had trauma wounds to the head .
why do we think the con man killed her ?
last week carla contacted a fraud website
to report a scam . the complaint ended up
on goldman &apos;s desk .
we spoke on the phone at length .
her story matched my guy to the &quot; t . &quot;
she planned on confronting him that night .
i told her to cease all communications
and wait for me
i &apos;d fly to miami and set up a sting .
but that never happened .
do you have physical evidence
confirming it &apos;s your guy ?
no but for her to be murdered the night that we spoke
i don &apos;t think it was a coincidence .
there was no sign of forced entry theft
or sexual assault .
and judging from the m.o. the motive was personal .
what &apos;s his hustle ?
investment fraud .
basically he &apos;s a smaller madoff .
to give you an idea of how convincing he is
this is a sampling of his work going back 14 years .
he &apos;s prolific .
he &apos;s scammed hundreds of thousands
of dollars from people but he &apos;s never been violent before .
con men usually don &apos;t murder
but when they do
it &apos;s to conceal their crimes .
con man &apos;s a nice name for these guys .
they profile as psychopaths .
they see their cons as theater and themselves
as a sort of puppeteer .
they have to have absolute control
over their victims and their cons .
maybe that &apos;s why he starting killing
because he lost control ?
the question is how out of control is he ?
well if he &apos;s spiraling
he &apos;s a danger to everyone around him .
and because he &apos;s so charming
the victims never see it coming .
who do i make it out to ?
grant dale investments inc .
hunter portland advisors incorporated .
henry moffet hedge funds incorporated .
henry moffet ...
hedge funds ...
inc .
this is a lot of money .
it &apos;ll be the best decision of your life .
&quot; if i am what i have &quot;
&quot; and if i lose what i have &quot;
&quot; who then am i ? &quot;
german psychologist erich fromm .
i can &apos;t believe you guys have your own jet .
we take turns piloting . you want to give her a try ?
really ?
no .
what kind of forensic countermeasures does he use
to hide his trail ?
fake i.d.s disposable phones
prepaid credit cards foreign bank accounts .
you can &apos;t track his accounts overseas ?
we can but it takes months to get the records
and it only takes him seconds
to transfer money again and again .
by the time you figure out it &apos;s in the bahamas
he &apos;s already moved it to switzerland or somewhere else .
i &apos;ve always been too far behind him .
well we &apos;re a lot closer now
because of carla .
what made her suspicious in the first place ?
she needed to get her father into a retirement home
and when she called this guy grant dale
to free up her money
he never returned her phone calls .
a con man &apos;s first instinct is flight
not fight .
what makes him kill though isn &apos;t financial
it &apos;s psychological .
that &apos;s what we need to concentrate on
why carla and why now ?
morgan and prentiss go to her house .
agent goldman why don &apos;t you join them .
i sent his case files to the field office .
shouldn &apos;t i stay with you and help you sift through them ?
i &apos;d like to go through them independently
come up with our own theories
see if any behavioral patterns emerge
that &apos;ll help us get ahead of him .
agent goldman &apos;s files are in that room down the hall .
thank you .
let me know if you need anything .
thank you .
you &apos;re kidding me .
we have to go through all of this ?
white collar cases often come down to a paper trail .
maybe it won &apos;t be so bad .
i mean at least it &apos;s well organized .
that &apos;s his job .
he sits at a desk all day
and accumulates paper evidence .
all right . dave you work victimology .
reid see if you can find anything in his travel patterns .
she was a real estate agent .
she was doing well for herself until william came into her life .
why do you call him that ?
he introduced himself as bill billy
or will
several times in his early cons .
my guess is that his real name
may be some form of william .
so most of his victims were very wealthy right ?
you should see some of their mansions .
well i &apos;m looking around this house and it &apos;s nice
but no mansion .
she didn &apos;t invest as much as his other clients either .
i wonder why he targeted her .
she may have been useful to him in some other way .
hey goldman .
what was the alias he was using with carla ?
grant dale .
come check this out .
he set up a website .
why didn &apos;t the detectives find this before ?
the locals wouldn &apos;t know to look for it .
well it &apos;s only one page .
generic investment information .
i mean there &apos;s no contacts there &apos;s no picture of himself .
no just photos of nice cars and houses .
so he &apos;s selling the fantasy of success .
his web design is pretty basic .
i mean it &apos;s like a standard template .
it would be fairly easy to set up .
maybe he created others .
i &apos;m gonna call garcia .
hey baby girl it &apos;s me .
you &apos;re on speaker .
oh sug i don &apos;t care who hears it .
it &apos;s always been you .
listen i just emailed you a link .
got it .
it &apos;s the unsub &apos;s website .
do you want me to find out how he paid
for his hosting services track him down that way ?
we &apos;ll run into the same backstopping trail .
oh you are right. that &apos;s untraceable .
all right we &apos;ll forget that .
can you do a search for websites
containing the same content ?
and searching ... and searching ...
there are 1.2-- 9 identical websites
same written content same pictures
just different names .
these are all new aliases .
and he &apos;s never had 10 at once .
this is all new .
i &apos;m henry moffet .
you lied to me about everything .
what are you talking about ?
your name is not grant dale .
god why are you doing this to me ?
just calm down. listen to me .
no just leave .
you &apos;re not giving me a chance to explain .
leave or i &apos;ll call the police !
grant ...
grant ...
grant ...
i &apos;m henry moffet .
henry moffet .
the cia assigns an agent 2 or 3 aliases at most .
any more than that
and it &apos;s difficult to keep the names straight .
this guy &apos;s juggling 10 .
being all these people that &apos;s gotta start fracturing him somehow .
if his memory is strained it could be causing him to lose control .
we have the current aliases .
we just need to know who the clients are .
got carla &apos;s phone records .
she made several calls to an unknown number the night she died .
i tracked the number .
it was a disposable phone
that hasn &apos;t been used since .
that &apos;s gotta be the unsub &apos;s number .
he tossed it after he killed her .
over the past few months
she routinely called this number really late at night .
how late ?
like bedtime late .
you don &apos;t do business with your investment manager at bedtime
so when are we gonna do this again ?
my husband &apos;s coming home so ...
i won &apos;t see you for a while .
i &apos;ll miss you ...
you lied to me grant .
about everything .
leave or i &apos;ll call the police !
grant are you ok ?
henry are you ok ?
i &apos;m gonna miss you too .
so carla never mentioned anything about an affair with him ?
no but it &apos;s always been a challenge with fraud victims
to be totally forthcoming .
they &apos;re so embarrassed about being duped
they don &apos;t tell you everything .
detective goldman .
we &apos;d like to compare notes .
shoot .
i &apos;m looking at the victimology .
we say affinity groups . same thing .
it refers to victims with shared interests .
ok. we &apos;re in your world we &apos;ll use your terms .
your files point to specific affinity groups he targeted
in the first few cities .
does this look accurate to you ?
yes it does .
once he got beyond san diego
his victims are all over the place . no shared interests .
i came to the same conclusions .
so he stopped using affinity groups
and found his victims somewhere else .
where i don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s where we start .
i &apos;m randy . randy .
randy .
i &apos;m randy summerland .
i &apos;m randy summerland .
make us some money ok ?
i can do that .
now how do i spell your name again ?
m @-@ o @-@ f @-@ f @-@ e @-@ t .
henry moffet hedge funds incorporated .
who is henry moffet ?
randy ...
who is henry moffet ?
it &apos;s my partner .
you didn &apos;t mention anything about a partner .
i didn &apos;t ?
and this isn &apos;t who i made the check out to last time .
he &apos;s been my partner for years .
then why am i making the check out to him ?
there &apos;s a simple explanation .
so the unsub and the vic are having drinks .
the vic has a checkbook and pen out
check &apos;s dated but that &apos;s it .
the unsub got that close to getting his money
somehow failed and then did this .
and this is overkill .
he bashed his head in .
he &apos;s completely unhinged and devolving fast .
only he doesn &apos;t know that .
he &apos;s still trying to go to work
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s in danger of losing it at any minute .
like a functioning alcoholic .
the unsub channels all of his energy into these cons
and when the con falls apart
this is how he handles it .
how long have you known randy ?
we spent a lot of time with him
in the last couple of months .
he was helping us invest .
how much money did you give to him ?
he just kept saying we needed to be aggressive in this market .
oh my god
this is all my fault .
what do you mean ?
i met randy .
i brought this man into our lives .
mrs. mckelson
is there anything more to your relationship with randy ?
we &apos;re gonna find out eventually .
find out what ?
randy wasn &apos;t who he said he was .
randy wasn &apos;t even his real name .
what ?
we think this man is using his looks and his charm
to target women .
so there &apos;s others .
i laid in bed next to the man
who killed my husband .
did they have transgressions ?
she &apos;s pretty beat up over it .
randy who is henry moffet ?
daddy ?
you &apos;re home !
hey good morning buddy .
let me look at you .
you &apos;re a handsome devil you know that ?
i missed you .
i missed you too .
bill when did you get in ?
just now .
how was your trip ?
it didn &apos;t really pan out .
sorry . what happened ?
can we uh talk about this after j . d. goes to school ?
i want pancakes .
really ? you do ?
well then pancakes you shall have .
you &apos;re not enjoying this are you ?
i like a good paper trail . i find it meditative .
is it really that hard for you to be normal just one time ?
he just burned another alias .
you know if this guy &apos;s on a mission
to eliminate all these aliases
he &apos;s gonna systematically assassinate his victims .
carla lived in miami .
this victim frank mckelson lived north in ft . lauderdale .
the victims could be anywhere in south florida .
if he &apos;s working harder because of the economy
it makes sense that he would expand his operating zone .
prentiss and rossi are on their way back . we need to give the profile .
there &apos;s something else about san diego .
i noticed in his earlier crimes he only stays in each city
an average of 14 to 18 months .
then he &apos;s in san diego for 3.1 / 2 years
and then never in the same city for that long again .
all right so what is it about san diego that made him stay longer ?
keep following that reid . see where it takes us .
are you sure ?
i wouldn &apos;t be doing this if we didn &apos;t have to .
j.d. was just starting to make new friends .
what do you want me to do ? the money has dried up here .
maybe you could take a break
spend more time with j.d.
ok then how am i supposed to raise a family
if i don &apos;t have enough clients ?
baby i hate seeing you so stressed out .
all right now this economy is killing me .
i can get a job too .
no . no i can take care of us myself .
well we have to figure something out because i don &apos;t want to move again .
listen we are moving to boston .
end of discussion .
honey what happened ?
now start packing .
this unsub is a white collar con man
who embodies what behaviorists call the dark triad--
narcissism
machiavellianism
and aberrant self @-@ promotion .
what that means is that everything revolves around this guy .
he manipulates and exploits others using dishonest tactics
and he &apos;s become a menace to society .
hunter .
hunter .
hunter .
i &apos;m hunter portland .
he &apos;s also what we call a casanova con man .
he seduces women to get to their money .
it &apos;s standard behavior for him
to have casual sex with multiple partners
and then use that as a weapon
to accomplish his goals .
we have his sketch .
and here on the board are his aliases .
he frequents high @-@ end venues--
country clubs hotel bars and membership @-@ only establishments .
and notify the banks .
he &apos;s constantly moving money
opening and closing bank accounts .
he &apos;s active in miami and ft . lauderdale
but he could be in other wealthy communities too .
look at places like boca raton
or coral gables .
he has too many aliases in his head right now
and it &apos;s causing him to fracture mentally .
and it &apos;s this loss of control
that triggers his violence and makes him dangerous to be around .
and any additional stress
will make him more likely to attack .
i don &apos;t have to go this long without seeing you .
i could fly to wherever you are .
you would just distract me .
we &apos;d just be spending all day in bed together .
my husband &apos;s gone for a week .
why don &apos;t you stay tonight ?
um ... i--i can &apos;t gorgeous .
i got to deposit your check in the bank before the market closes .
do you think that we could be happy together ?
what ?
i could leave my husband .
um ... slow down .
hunter . hunter not now .
i gotta--i gotta take this .
hello ?
don &apos;t be mad at me but i want my check back .
what ?
i got another call . uh don &apos;t go anywhere .
no--
bill--
yes i &apos;m here .
i need you to pick up j.d. from tod &apos;s
and drop him off at piano .
no i can &apos;t .
my car broke down . help me out here .
fine .
hello .
henry i &apos;m really sorry i just--
i don &apos;t want to move forward .
look i can guarantee your money .
why what do you mean ?
well i don &apos;t do this for just anybody
but since it &apos;s you i can uh protect you from any risk .
i &apos;ll pick you up in a little bit and we &apos;ll talk about it ok ?
ok henry .
hunter ?
i need you to listen to me .
ok .
i &apos;m pregnant .
it &apos;s yours .
grant dale .
bill .
agent jareau said you have something .
i spoke to his victims .
before san diego they described him
as driving exotic sports cars .
after san diego they described him as driving
larger sedans and suvs . before san diego
he lived in condos referred to them as bachelor pads .
after san diego spoke of living in gated communities
with large yards .
what forces a man to stay put in one place for a while
downgrade his car upgrade his house ?
you think he has a family ?
these are lifestyle changes a new dad would make .
why would he start a family ?
because he wants to appear normal
and a family does that for a psychopath .
wives usually serve a purpose
as a caretaker or homemaker .
they value their offspring
as an extension of themselves
and it also feeds their narcissistic ego .
these are interesting theories
but how does this help us ?
as a forensic countermeasure
con men put everything in their wives &apos; names .
bank accounts cars homes .
and if his wife isn &apos;t complicit in his crimes
she &apos;ll still be using her real name .
if we find the wife
we can find the unsub .
thank you for the drink
and for guaranteeing my money .
it &apos;s all gonna work out .
i just got scared .
i understand .
you pressed the wrong button .
dad ?
daddy ?
hey that &apos;s me .
can i talk to you about something ?
yeah of course buddy .
do we have to move again ?
i like it here .
you know i &apos;m really disappointed in you .
sorry .
i &apos;m really disappointed because you didn &apos;t say something sooner .
you know if you want something in life
as a man you need to ask for it .
now let that be a lesson .
ok .
so you really like it here huh big guy ?
yeah .
well i think i may have found a way
for us to stay for a while .
serious ?
yeah .
i just need to dump my client list and start over .
so we can stay ?
i &apos;d do anything for you kiddo .
what is that ?
just hang out here for a sec all right ?
watch your video .
what is it ?
spare tire came loose .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m fixing it .
massive blunt force trauma to the head
same as the others .
does it make sense for him to dump her like this ?
he &apos;s killed 2 people in 2 days .
his fracturing is intensifying .
when a criminal devolves like this
they &apos;re capable of anything .
jj said a man reported his wife missing last night .
description matches the body . name &apos;s lorraine horton .
do we know anything about her investment history ?
the team &apos;s looking into it right now .
ok so he killed his first victim in miami and then left town
came to ft . lauderdale killed his second victim here
but he didn &apos;t leave town for his third .
is there a significance to him staying in ft . lauderdale ?
guys what if his family lives here ?
that &apos;s why he &apos;s trying to eliminate threats to himself here
&apos;cause this is his home where he needs to protect his identity .
hey garcia .
em i feel like i &apos;ve been sent on a wild snipe hunt .
do you have any idea how many women in south florida
lease luxury cars and rent mansions ?
i will answer . too many . that &apos;s how many .
ok narrow the search down to ft . lauderdale only .
look at women who moved here 8 to 12 months ago
see if any of them have any history with san diego .
ok . i &apos;ll call you back when i find the elusive snipe creature .
this is gonna be good for us .
i don &apos;t understand .
i thought you would be happy .
just yesterday you were hell @-@ bent on moving us immediately .
yeah and then you and j.d. both said you wanted to stay
so i found a way to make it happen .
how ?
i just did .
what is going on with you ?
you know what ?
i thought i was doing you a favor .
i don &apos;t have time for this .
good afternoon .
i &apos;m stuart . you asked for the bank manager ?
agents rossi and jareau fbi .
we need some information on a client named lorraine horton .
is ms . horton ok ?
can you check her recent banking activities
see if there &apos;s anything unusual ?
maybe a check written to a person &apos;s corporation .
i know she recently came into more money .
her mother passed . they sold the house
and she got a pretty good sum for it .
she sold a house ?
yes sir .
wasn &apos;t the first victim in real estate ?
we &apos;ve been asking ourselves
how he finds his victims now .
we just found out lorraine got a large windfall
from selling her mother &apos;s house .
carla marshall the first victim
was in real estate .
when you sell a house your property becomes public record .
your name goes on these lists .
lists compiled by lead brokers
and sold to the real estate companies .
hey pen .
oh man it is raining snipe all up in here .
did you know that your boat owners frank and dina mckelson
sold a house in hawaii about 8 months ago ?
do any of them have a direct connection to carla marshall ?
ah carla generated these letters
advertising the swanky beachfront condos
her company sells-- stay with me--
lorraine horton the lady who was murdered this morning
her address along with the mckelsons &apos; address
are buried in a spreadsheet in carla &apos;s laptop .
that &apos;s how the unsub found his victims .
he used carla to get her leads .
that &apos;s why he targeted her .
she gave him access to a list of people
with a large amount of liquid assets .
we need that list .
already flying to you .
but that is not all folks .
i think i may have found the wife .
i did a search on women who &apos;ve lived in ft . lauderdale
for the last 8 to 12 months
who rent houses and cars and have a history in san diego .
came up with about a dozen names but ...
ooh la la only one of them works in real estate .
who ?
her name &apos;s rebecca hodges . she has a 9 @-@ year @-@ old son
john davison hodges born in san diego
father on birth certificate
listed as william hodges .
william .
i got the address of the house she &apos;s renting too .
let &apos;s head over there . morgan pull the son out of school .
jj and reid go over the list of potential victims .
if anybody knows the unsub send units to them .
ok so i &apos;m gonna go deal with this client .
will you call me later ?
yeah i will .
did you forget something ?
are you a client of bill &apos;s ?
who ?
don &apos;t do that . i saw him leaving here .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you should leave .
i saw you with my husband .
do you know we have a son ?
his name is j.d.
you didn &apos;t know bill was married ?
i didn &apos;t know his name was bill .
again this is agent jareau .
it &apos;s very important that you call me back .
thank you .
thank you . yeah thanks so much .
i just confirmed another potential victim . i sent a unit over .
i can &apos;t get ahold of this one couple
hector and brooke sanchez .
hurry up .
dad where are we going ?
we &apos;re going to get mom . it &apos;s a surprise .
what kind of surprise ?
we &apos;re going to boston .
but you said yesterday--
just get in the car ok ?
hurry up .
do you know you pick your nails when you &apos;re anxious ?
i &apos;ve never been in a bureau car chasing a killer before .
you ready to meet william face to face ?
it &apos;s about damn time .
dad where are you going ?
quiet . just shut up and let me think .
daddy ...
i &apos;m sorry kiddo . i didn &apos;t mean to yell at you .
where &apos;s mommy ?
that &apos;s a good question .
that &apos;s him calling .
well don &apos;t answer it .
we need to talk .
i am pregnant .
it &apos;s his .
oh my god .

and wait for mommy to call back all right ?

it &apos;s morgan . hey morgan .
yeah reid listen i &apos;m at the son &apos;s school .
principal says that j.d. hodges
was pulled out of class 45 minutes ago .

he &apos;s gonna try and leave with his family .
all right thanks i &apos;ll let everyone know .
garcia ?
what up jj ?
can you find out if rebecca hodges has a cell phone ?
we want to try and track where she is right now .
uno momento .
something &apos;s weird .
what ?
the wife has 2 cell phones listed in her name .
one could be hers one could be his ?
he put them both in her name .
yeah but they &apos;re both active in the same quadrant right now .
where ?
some posh ft . lauderdale neighborhood .
wait a second .
a couple on our potential victims list lives in the same area .
hector and brooke sanchez .
that &apos;s the woman i can &apos;t get ahold of .
hotch .
ok got it reid .
direct everyone to the sanchez house .
thanks .
what &apos;s the wife doing at a victim &apos;s house ?
were we wrong about her ?
do you think she &apos;s complicit ?
i don &apos;t think so . if she was he &apos;d use her in the con .
he told me his name was hunter portland .
how long have you been seeing him ?
we vacationed in st. croix together .
what ? when ?
last month .
he said he was in boston on a business trip .
brooke you here ?
you must think i &apos;m an idiot .
it &apos;s not true .
how could you do this to your family ?
i provide everything for my family .
were you just after my money this whole time ?
no . no i told you i was gonna take care of you .
all those times you traveled for work--
are there other women ?

bill .
shut up !
we got a car down the street and one in the driveway .
both plates match the wife &apos;s name .
remember there &apos;s a 9 @-@ year @-@ old boy in there

i &apos;m afraid so .
the man i lived with for 10 years
was loving and gentle .
he isn &apos;t capable of this .
there &apos;s more about him that we don &apos;t know .
you should be prepared .
you &apos;re going to be interviewed in detail .
right now i want to take my son home .
ok . i &apos;ll have someone drive you .
mommy !
oh mommy &apos;s here baby .
you know your daddy loved you more than anything right ?
i know .
so where do you want these ?
i don &apos;t care .
are you ok ?
i thought he had a weapon .
yeah . that was a justified shot .
why did he do that ?
he had a wife a son .
a guy like that
he likes his car his house his lifestyle .
he knew he wasn &apos;t going to do well in prison .
so he decided his own fate .
i never even found out his real name .
