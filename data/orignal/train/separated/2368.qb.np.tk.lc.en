you must be elena .
how do we look exactly alike ?
you &apos;re a petrova doppelganger .
you &apos;re the key to breaking the curse .
klaus is a vampire born from a werewolf bloodline .
the curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting .
he &apos;ll be vulnerable during the transformation .
that &apos;s when bonnie comes in .
if she can deliver him to the brink of death ,
i &apos;ll finish the job myself .
i had a family .
klaus hunted them down one by one .
he scattered them across the seas ,
where their bodies could not be found .
i didn &apos;t bury them at sea .
their bodies are safe .
if you kill me , you &apos;ll never find them .
no !
who &apos;s going to save your life while you &apos;re out making decisions ?
i don &apos;t want to be saved .
there is another way .
what are you--damon , no .
i fed her my blood .
she &apos;ll come back a vampire .
how could you take that choice away from her ?
she &apos;ll never forgive you .
tyler lockwood bit me .
a werewolf bite can kill a vampire .
that &apos;ll get easier .
but you know that .
what do you want ?
i want to apologize .
damon .
please .
elena , feeding you my blood , i was wrong .
yes , you were .
and i know i don &apos;t deserve your forgiveness , but ...
i need it .
and i need some time ,
maybe a lot of time .
true . of course .
take all the time you need .
get off of me .
you &apos;re not doing this .
just did .
you know what happened to rose , stefan .
i don &apos;t care .
you &apos;re not dying today .
what &apos;s the plan , superman ?
i &apos;m gonna find a way out of this .
oh , right .
a miracle cure .
good luck with that one .
i got bonnie looking for something , anything .
always the hero , stefan .
just tell me good @-@ bye , get it over with .
lie still .
conserve your strength .
you &apos;ve been busy .
that was amazing .
how long has it been ?
almost 2 days .
full moon came and went . you remained a wolf .
i can change at will , then .
it &apos;s good to know .
i remember every single kill .
yes , i &apos;ve been cleaning up your little mess along the way .
just like old times , brother .
you &apos;ve had your fun . i believe we have a bargain .
that &apos;s right .
now , what was it again ?
oh , yeah . wait . i remember . that &apos;s it .
you wish to be reunited with our family .
you gave me your word , niklaus .
what kind of brother would break his bond ?
even though you did try to kill me .
i could have .
but i didn &apos;t .
and now no one can ,
not even you .
relax , elijah .
all is forgiven .
where are they ?
you need to lighten up .
i &apos;ll bring you to them soon enough .
sorry . you &apos;ve reached somebody who &apos;s currently not operating .
i need your help .
well , you must have me confused with somebody else .
you see , i &apos;m not allowed to help ,
just idly sit by
while my girlfriend gets sacrificed on an altar of blood .
damon &apos;s dying .
what ?
tyler lockwood bit him . we don &apos;t have much time .
what do you need ?
you brought me to see a girl movie .
we had to get out of the house , jer .
this is our 3 @-@ hour distraction from reality .
is that what we &apos;re doing ?
pretending like our lives aren &apos;t screwed ?
we need to do this , ok ?
breathe , eat , sleep ,
wake up , and do it all over again .
until one day , it &apos;s just not as hard anymore .
hey ! there you guys are .
who &apos;s hungry ?
are we really doing this ?
yes , we are really doing this .
we are going to take a page from scarlett .
we made it through the war .
i know you guys went through hell ,
and my mom knows i am a vampire ,
so basically it &apos;s like atlanta has burned .
and yet , in spite of everything ,
we persevere .
all right .
what are we eating ?
something good .
i &apos;m not sure this is going to work .
we &apos;ve done this thing before , right ?
contacted emily bennett .
maybe one of the witches might know how to help damon .
let &apos;s just hope they want to .
phesmatos manex un domo hax , fero adiuvex .
phesmatos manex .
phesmatos manex un domo hax ,
fero adiuvex .
bonnie .
bonnie .
emily .
why have you come here , stefan ?
i need your help .
i need to know if there &apos;s a spell
that can heal a werewolf bite .
no .
nature ensures a balance to everything .
is that true ...
or are you just saying no because it &apos;s damon ?
perhaps it is his time to die .
no .
that &apos;s not balance .
that &apos;s punishment .
i will not give you what you want .
so you &apos;re saying that there &apos;s an answer to give ?
please , if you know something , just tell me .
help me save my brother .
bonnie .
they don &apos;t want us here .
they think i &apos;m abusing their power .
they know something . there &apos;s an answer .
they just don &apos;t want to tell me .
i heard them say a name .
what was it ?
klaus .
carol . hi .
how you feeling ?
better , thank goodness .
that was a terrible fall .
shouldn &apos;t you be home resting ?
i &apos;ve been resting ,
and now i &apos;m ready to get back to work .
i need you to update me
on where we are with the vampire situation .
well , there have been some developments ,
but i &apos;m handling it .
are you ?
because i left you in charge of this town &apos;s safety ,
and lately i &apos;m not seeing any results .
i said i &apos;m handling it .
then see that you do , sheriff ,
because if you can &apos;t , i &apos;ll find someone who will .
look who couldn &apos;t resist an epic romance .
will you come take a walk with me ?
you &apos;re breaking the rules , you know .
movie night &apos;s supposed to be a distraction .
tomorrow we can return to our regularly scheduled drama .
i know . i wish this could wait , but it can &apos;t .
listen , the other night when damon was helping tyler ,
something happened .
tyler was starting to transform ,
and damon was bitten .
what ?
is it--is he gonna--
yeah .
oh , my god .
and he came to the house this morning
and--and tried to apologize .
i practically slammed the door in his face .
he told me not to tell you ,
but i figured if you wanted to talk to him , i--
i wouldn &apos;t wait .
stefan--
it &apos;s not over .
there might be a cure ,
but i have to find klaus to get it .
no . he &apos;s gonna kill you .
no , he had the chance to kill me , but he didn &apos;t .
whatever damon &apos;s done ,
whatever has led him here ,
i &apos;m the one that made him become a vampire in the first place ,
so if there &apos;s a chance for a cure ,
i owe it to him to find it .
go talk to him .
just tell him that there &apos;s still hope .
mr. salvatore , spying on a lady
is a sign of very poor manners .
my apologies , miss katherine .
but since you are here ,
my corset strings seem to be knotted .
i wonder if you can undo them .
of course .
will you miss me while off defending the south ?
i shall .
then i hope you will hurry back .
i fear i will be lonely with you away .
i would think stefan should be company enough .
is it so wrong for me to want you both ?
damon .
elena ?
don &apos;t you see ?
she was toying with you .
all you had to do was say no , walk away .
you had a choice .
promise me that you will return quickly .
i promise .
hello , katherine .
2 days , i &apos;ve been waiting .
i &apos;m supposed to be free of klaus &apos; compulsion by now .
he &apos;s supposed to be dead .
we ran into complications .
complications ?
doesn &apos;t really matter . i just need to find him .
do you have any idea where he might be ?
klaus , you &apos;re back .
look who decided to come for a visit .
you just keep popping up , don &apos;t you ?
i need your help ...
for my brother .
well , whatever it is , he &apos;s gonna have to wait a tick .
you see , i have an obligation to my brother
that requires my immediate attention .
you understand how important family is ,
or you wouldn &apos;t be here .
my brother gave me his word that he
would reunite me with my own .
and so i shall .
now , what am i gonna do with you ?
do you feel that ?
it &apos;s scraping against your heart .
the slightest little movement ,
and you &apos;re dead .
he &apos;s just trying to help his brother .
the witches said you had a cure .
make me a deal . just give me the cure ,
and i &apos;ll do whatever you want .
trouble is i don &apos;t know if you &apos;d be any good to me
the way you are now .
you are just shy of useless .
well , that looks bad .
it feels worse .
my subconscious is haunting me , rick .
please tell me you have something for that .
double shot .
that &apos;s good .
oh , good .
so my brother sent you for suicide watch ?
he &apos;s just trying to help .
he &apos;s doing what he always does ,
trying to right the wrongs of the past .
you should want me dead .
i &apos;m the reason jenna got killed .
i don &apos;t blame you for jenna .
oh , sure you do .
let &apos;s not forget i turned your wife into a vampire .
you must really hate me for that one .
ok , give me your glass . neither one of us
is drunk enough for this conversation .
kill me .
please .
screw you .
no .
elena ?
elena &apos;s not here , damon .
don &apos;t make a sound .
i need blood .
i need blood .
where &apos;s damon ?
you know , now &apos;s not a good time , sheriff . trust me .
sheriff , over here .
i wouldn &apos;t go in there .
i just wanna talk to him .
i wouldn &apos;t go in there .
liz .
all this waiting around for news
is ruining scarlett for me .
alaric . hey .
tell me you &apos;re with elena .
she went to go see damon .
i thought that &apos;s where you were .
no , he just escaped . i think he &apos;s looking for her ,
and the cops are after him .
listen , he &apos;s in bad shape , jeremy ,
so if you find her , get her somewhere safe , ok ?
i &apos;m on my way .
if damon is off the rails ,
there is nothing you can do to stop him . let us take care of it .
you keep doing this .
you left me behind before ,
and guess what . jenna still died .
now i &apos;m going to find my sister .
you go ahead and you try to stop me .
i heard about this one vampire ,
crazy bloke ,
always on and off the wagon for decades .
when he was off , he was magnificent .
1917 , he went into monterey
and wiped out an entire migrant village ...
a true ripper .
sound familiar ?
i haven &apos;t been that way in a very long time .
well , that &apos;s the vampire i can make a deal with .
that is the kind of talent
that i can use when i leave this town .
katerina , come here .
no .
you want your cure ?
there it is .
your blood is the cure .
gotta love mother nature .
now ...
let &apos;s talk , you and i.
katherine ?
damon .
where &apos;s elena ? i need to see elena now .
ok . let &apos;s get you out of here first , all right ?
where &apos;s damon ?
what did you do to him ?
why do you even care ?
you know what they are , what they do .
look , i understand why you hate them ,
but you &apos;re wrong .
they &apos;re murderers , elena . end of story .
damon salvatore
was just spotted outside entering the grill .
wait . you &apos;ve gotta let me come with you .
he &apos;s sick . he &apos;s--he &apos;s not himself .
keep her here .
hey , it &apos;s me . i &apos;m with damon at the grill .
oh , god .
i &apos;ve got a gunshot victim at the grill .
get the paramedics here .
you &apos;re gonna be fine .
jeremy !
it &apos;s gonna be ok .
mom .
mom , what did you do ?
i was aiming for damon .
he still has his ring .
she &apos;s human . the ring won &apos;t work on him .
caroline .
i got it .

just drink . go on , jeremy . drink .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m helping him .
jeremy , drink .
please . please . please .
bonnie , what &apos;s going on ?
oh , my god .

i need you to grab him .
t @-@ take him with us .
no , no , no , no .
you can &apos;t move him . this is a crime scene .
mom , you let them go .
all right , come here , buddy .
i got you . i got you .
there it is .
you want to save your brother ?
how about a decade @-@ long bender ?
you know , i have big plans for you
when we leave this town .
i &apos;m not like that anymore .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
you would have made a hell of a wingman .
wait .
now that &apos;s more like it .
i want you to join me for a drink .
finish it .
all of it .
you do everything i say ,
and i save your brother .
that &apos;s the deal .
again .
is this even possible ?
there &apos;s a spell for it ,
if they &apos;ll give me the power to use it .
vitas phasmatis ex silento .
revertas phasmatis ut victus .
vitas phasmatis ex silento .
revertas phasmatis ut victus .
no .
what ? what is it ?
they &apos;re angry at me for coming back here .
they don &apos;t wanna help .
well , they have to .
they said there &apos;ll be consequences .
well , he &apos;s just a kid . tell &apos; em to shut up .

what happened ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
you &apos;re ok .
you &apos;re ok .
thank you .
haven &apos;t left much for the yankees to take , have we ?
let &apos;s make a dash for it
before the fire reaches that ammunition .
elena .
damon .
hey , come on . come on .
we have to get you out of here .
let &apos;s hide you .
where are we going ?
everywhere !
wait for me . i want to come with you .
relax .
we need to get you out of here .
you &apos;re faster than i thought .
why must you always run from me ?
because i know that you will chase .
then let me chase you forever .
feed me your blood .
i will not feed you , damon .
if you want it , take it .
it is your choice to make .
i choose you , katherine .
look at me . hey . it &apos;s elena .
it &apos;s elena .
promise me you will not tell my brother .
i promise .
it will be our little secret .
no . damon .
no .
i have to ...
if we are to be together forever .
damon , stop . you &apos;re hurting me .
damon , you don &apos;t have to do this . please stop .
you &apos;re hurting me .
elena .
damon .
damon .
that was bonnie .
jeremy &apos;s alive .
i thought i killed him .
you did .
i don &apos;t understand .
i explained it to you once .
but i had to make you forget
because i was so scared
of what you might do .
but now ...
i don &apos;t wanna lie .
i &apos;m not gonna be afraid of you anymore .
i don &apos;t want you to be afraid of me anymore .
i &apos;m still your little girl .
it &apos;s me .
it &apos;s me , mom .
hey . how you doing ?
trying to figure out what &apos;s wrong with me .
feel different , weird .
yeah , you were dead .
it &apos;d be weird if you felt normal .
bonnie , i , uh-- i don &apos;t know how to thank you .
you can thank me tomorrow .
and the day after that .
and the day after that .
good night , jeremy .
good night .
hey , bud .
i &apos;ve gotta take off .
need anything ?
uh , no , no .
i think i &apos;m good .
you know , uh , on second thought ,
i might just crash here . is that cool ?
yeah , yeah . sure . whatever .
all right .
alaric , um ...
thank you for everything .
ah , you can thank me tomorrow ...
and the day after that , the day after that .
dude , come on ! i knew you were listening .
and the day after that .
elena .
it &apos;s ok , damon . i &apos;m right here .
elena , get out of here .
i could hurt you .
no . you won &apos;t .
i &apos;m here until the very end .
i &apos;m not leaving you .
get out of here .
hang on .
shh . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s not ok . it &apos;s not ok .
all those years , i &apos;ve blamed stefan .
no one forced me to love her .
it was my own choice .
i made the wrong choice .
you tell stefan i &apos;m sorry .
ok ?
i will .
you &apos;re very cooperative .
it &apos;s almost as if you &apos;re enjoying it .
no more .
not until you give me the cure .
not until we make a deal .
it &apos;s your choice , stefan .
you can either remain here
living your life in mystic falls ,
or you can embrace what you truly are ,
leave town with me ,
and save your brother &apos;s life .
that &apos;s the spirit .
sweetheart ...
take this over to damon and come right back .
you want me to leave ?
no .
yes .
and if i were you ...
i &apos;d hurry .
she &apos;ll never take it to him .
she &apos;ll never take it to him .
this is even more pitiful than i thought .
there &apos;s still hope .
i &apos;ve made a lot of choices that have gotten me here .
i deserve this .
i deserve to die .
no .
you don &apos;t .
i do , elena . it &apos;s ok .
&apos;cause if i &apos;d have chosen differently ,
i wouldn &apos;t have met you .
i &apos;m so sorry .
done so many things to hurt you .
it &apos;s ok .
i forgive you .
i know you love stefan .
and it will always be stefan .
but i love you .
you should know that .
i do .
you should have met me in 1864 .
you would have liked me .
i like you now .
just the way you are .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
well , it &apos;s me you should be thanking .
i mean , i &apos;m the one who brought the cure .
i thought you were dead .
i was .
you got free .
yep . finally .
and you still came here ?
i owed you one .
where &apos;s stefan ?
are you sure you care ?
where is he ?
he &apos;s paying for this .
he gave himself over to klaus .
i wouldn &apos;t expect him anytime soon .
what do you mean , &quot; he gave himself over &quot; ?
he just sacrificed everything to save his brother ,
including you .
it &apos;s a good thing you have damon to keep you company .
good @-@ bye , elena .
it &apos;s ok to love them both .
i did .
i suppose , brother ,
you &apos;ve been reunited with our family .
put him with the others .
we &apos;re leaving town tonight .
so ...
did katerina make it in time ?
you won &apos;t be seeing her again , you know .
because she &apos;s on vervain ?
i &apos;ve been around a long time , stefan .
i rarely get played for a fool .
besides , she won &apos;t get far .
you &apos;ll help me see to that .
what is it you really want from me ?
all will be explained in time
once we leave this tragic little town .
then are we done here ?
can we go ?
not quite .
you see , i have a gift for you .
come here , sweetheart .
don &apos;t be afraid .
see , i wanna make sure you honor our deal ...
that you &apos;ll be of use to me .
i could have compelled her to behave ,
but a real ripper enjoys the hunt .
now we can go .
alaric ?
alaric .
jer .
anna .
