future perfect
ok , this sounded like a lot
more fun after 3 margaritas .
you were the one craving frog &apos;s legs .
yeah , in a restaurant with an a / c
and a nice little arugula salad on the side .
are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
of course . my dad must have taken me frogging a thousand times .
and , that , ladies and gentlemen ,
is how it &apos;s done .
gross .
no , it &apos;s not .
where do you think your food comes from ?
the supermarket .
give me the flashlight .
it &apos;s your turn .
go on .
hold it up like that . there you go .
i got it .
all right . that &apos;s what i &apos;m talkin &apos; about .
wow , that was actually kind of fun .
must be stuck . unh .
i &apos;m in .
well , i think you &apos;re bluffing .
so i will see your fuzzy pencil ...
and raise you
from the dominican republic one fuente fuente opusx .
i don &apos;t understand what we &apos;re betting .
i don &apos;t smoke .
because poker is not fun
unless you have something on the line .
fine . give me 3 cards .
yeah , i &apos;m good .
what ? really ?
you have heard the expression &quot; a poker face &quot; before ?
this will not go on forever , penelope .
it--it feels like it will .
i &apos;m scared .
there are people out there that want to hurt me .
i &apos;m scared i &apos;m gonna be stuck in here
because there &apos;s people out there that are gonna hurt me .
it &apos;s hotch . we have a case .
listen ...
we &apos;re gonna take these guys down .
in the meantime ,
you just have to stay strong .
st. augustine , florida , two bodies
were found early this evening in a remote wooded area
just west of the city . neither have been identified yet .
this woman &apos;s complexion ...
she was exsanguinated ,
which is a really fun word to say ,
but i didn &apos;t know its terrible meaning
until i started working here .
odd that only the female had her blood removed .
well , the male victim might have been collateral damage
or a witness that needed to be silenced .
i mean it is the kind of message
that rival drug gangs would send to each other .
the curiel syndicate recently set up shop in florida .
except it looks like these two were meant
to vanish without anyone the wiser .
how is that a message ?
well , cartels have also been known
to use murder as a form of voodoo .
in 1989 , a university of texas student
was murdered by a satanic gang while on spring break .
well , my gut says it has nothing to do with drugs .
more like straight out vampirism or someone with a blood fetish .
it &apos;s late and we need to hit the ground running . wheels up in 30 .
hello ?
are you ready ?
yes .
wait--what &apos;s that ?
don &apos;t you trust me ?
uh ... you never said anything about a blindfold .
it &apos;s required .
you know , i , uh ,
this is kind of freaking me out .
i changed my mind .
&quot; the clock talked loud .
i threw it away .
it scared me when it talked . &quot;
tillie olsen .
the coroner attributes the lacerations on the bodies
to animal bites .
apparently there &apos;s a lot of raccoons in the area .
maybe so , but the media &apos;s going all in with satanic mutilation .
it &apos;s happened before . the west memphis three case
showed how animal activity on a corpse
can be mistaken for for ritualized torture .
after the first bite , the insect infestation expands
and distorts the open wound .
ok , here &apos;s my finger , here &apos;s the mute button .
are you guys done talking about the critter damage ?
you can put your finger down , baby girl . we &apos;re done .
thank you . and jj &apos;s right , local news and radio outlets
hey , new information .
both of those bodies have just been identified .
cheyenne pravato , 23,
and george henning , 71 .
any connection ?
my level one search says no .
my level 2 through 20 await .
cheyenne was a waitress that is currently unemployed .
henning was a retired steelworker from pennsylvania .
lived in florida a few years .
they both went missing 3 days ago .
3 days ? coroner estimated the time of death
as less than 24 hours from the time of discovery .
means the unsub had the vics
for two full days before killing them .
preliminary indicators show no sign of torture or sexual assault .
what was he doing with them ?
dave , you find out what you can about cheyenne
from friends and family .
morgan , you do the same thing for henning .
lewis , you go to the m.e.
and jj , i need you to rein in the media .
hysteria &apos;s growing and we need to contain it .
thanks for coming so quickly .
of course .
it &apos;s crazy .
people are talking about devil worship ,
human sacrifice .
thought this might be a good place
for you and your team to work ?
it &apos;s great . thank you .
we need to debrief the press as soon as possible .
you don &apos;t mind doing double duty on this , do you ?
i &apos;m looking forward to it , actually .
dust off the old media liaison skills .
it &apos;s important . publicity like this
could encourage the unsub or inspire a copycat .
still waiting on the full tox screen for the male victim .
we think they may have been held for up to two days .
were they fed ?
stomach contents were empty ,
but nutrition and hydration levels were normal .
my guess is they were both fed through i.v.
i did find one curiosity .
it looks like another animal bite .
not under magnification .
it &apos;s actually a surgically precise triangle .
dr. gaylen .
you &apos;re positive of that ?
the tox screen and dna tests on george henning just came back .
are you ready for this ?
most of the blood in his body isn &apos;t his .
it &apos;s cheyenne &apos;s .
agent hotchner . a missing persons report just came in
that i think might be connected to the case .
andrea gambrell . her car was found abandoned
at a cemetery up near jacksonville this morning .
what makes you think it &apos;s related ?
andrea and cheyenne waitressed at the same restaurant .
roommate said andrea was meeting some new guy ,
it involved something mysterious .
where--where am i ?
please ...
the blood drained from cheyenne was put into george henning ?
i agree that is strange .
and a triangle was cut from his calf muscle .
dear diary , just when i thought i &apos;d heard it all .
and there &apos;s still something in the toxicology screen
that the m.e. can &apos;t identify .
yeah . we &apos;re hoping we &apos;re gonna find out
something more in the next few hours .
so , it took a little arm @-@ wrestling ,
but the media finally saw the wisdom
in toning down the whole demon worship angle .
don &apos;t take a victory lap just yet .
you &apos;re kidding .
i &apos;m just trying to work out this whole calf muscle business .
triangles are big in illuminati symbolism .
this is bending back toward cult behavior .
what did you find out about george henning ?
according to the neighbors , the guy was a shut @-@ in .
no friends or family , a lot of health problems .
hypertension , parkinson &apos;s .
cheyenne was the opposite .
vegan , into new age lifestyles .
never met a harmonic convergence she didn &apos;t want to converge on .
i mean , i get it , because henning was a recluse ,
but how did nobody notice her missing for 3 days ?
her friends said that cheyenne was flighty .
it was not unusual for her to take off without notice
for a week or two .
this unsub did his homework .
he knew that both victims
could go missing without any alarms going off .
transfusions and sustained i.v. feeding
take skill , planning , and access to materials .
and crude as it was ,
the replacing of the old blood with new is dialysis .
what if the triangle isn &apos;t a symbol , but a tissue sample ?
could this be medical experimentation ?
yeah , i mean , you &apos;ve got a youthful , healthy host in cheyenne
and a sick test subject in henning .
if the new missing girl &apos;s his next victim ,
the unsub could be getting ready to try again .
and this experiment takes two to tango .
if andrea mirrors cheyenne ,
then who mirrors george ?
please , don &apos;t do this .
i have to go to work now ,
but i &apos;ll be back this evening .
what--
don &apos;t worry . i promise i &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
how you feeling , sweetheart ?
i &apos;m ok .
it &apos;s a long drive ,
but i feel good about this time .
i miss home .
so do i.
but this could be our answer .
they do cutting @-@ edge stuff here .
all those tests . i don &apos;t know , ben .
maybe it &apos;s better just to accept things as they are .
don &apos;t talk like that . a positive attitude is half the battle .
mr. and mrs . kebler .
yes .
the lab results are back from eileen &apos;s tests .
let &apos;s go into my office and talk .
sir , yes , sir .
garcia , i need you to do a search
of doctors and medical professionals in the region
and see what kind of red flags pop up .
but of course . carmine , scarlet , cherry ,
crimson , maroon ? what shade of red are we looking for ?
ethics violations , improper protocol .
this person may have washed out of medical school
or gotten in trouble with
the licensing board for unorthodox practices .
a deep shade . hit you back when i have something .
i &apos;m sorry .
there are drugs that can minimize the symptoms .
how long does she have ?
mr. kebler , i would rather
talk about how we can begin a strategy--
how long ?
my wife and i want to know the truth .
6 months .
maybe a little more .
ben , it &apos;s all right .
i had a carpet store back home , dr. braga .
my wife taught middle school for 35 years .
we scrimped and we saved our whole lives
because we knew this time was coming .
retirement .
the freedom to do all those things we love to do , together .
it &apos;s not fair .
no , it &apos;s not .
i &apos;d like to start her with this ,
and i &apos;d like to see eileen tomorrow morning
to talk about a treatment strategy .
duloxetine . what &apos;s that ?
an anti @-@ depressant .
we drove 12 hours to come to this office .
we even rented an apartment in town .
according to your website , there are treatments at this hospital
you can &apos;t get anywhere else .
clinical trials .
not for what eileen is suffering from .
it &apos;s important that you and your wife
cherish the time you do have left together .
each and every day is precious .
i would like to see eileen at 10 : 00 tomorrow ,
if that works for you .
what have you got , garcia ?
nothing on my crimson flag doctor search ,
but i did learn about something with a super cool name .
加入疯狂科学家俱乐部
the mad scientist club .
and what &apos;s that ?
they &apos;re a student group
from the florida college of medicine in jacksonville .
before they disbanded , they used to get together
and talk about experimental ways to cure disease .
do you have the names of the people in the club ?
uh , kinda sorta not , really .
they were totally informal .
here &apos;s the part that made me sit up straight .
they used to meet at a local cemetery .
let me guess . the same cemetery
where andrea gambrell disappeared .
yeah , the very one .
all right , keep working on the names
and see if you can find out why the club was disbanded .
ok .
agent lewis .
yes , agent . i &apos;ve got the full tox screen on george henning .
there were massive levels of levodopa in his system .
the parkinson &apos;s drug ?
correct .
ok , but his blood was replaced with cheyenne &apos;s ,
so does that mean the levodopa was introduced into his system
after the transfusion ?
yes . ma &apos;am . and we got the results
of the other dna samples and the surprises keep coming .
found traces of mesoglea and testudinata keratin .
which is ?
jellyfish and turtle .
george henning had animal dna in his system .
if only you could talk ...
what secrets you could tell .
no !
stop !
don &apos;t die .
breathe .
breathe !
breathe !
breathe ! breathe !
breathe !
breathe !
breathe !
noooo !
no !
no !
no !
no ! no !
no ! nooo !
garcia &apos;s tracking recent aquarium
and exotic fish sales in the area .
aquarium sales in florida .
that &apos;s like tracking snow shovel sales in alaska .
but jellyfish have unique dietary and habitat needs ,
so hopefully that &apos;ll narrow it down a little .
a body &apos;s just been found .
officer on the scene thinks it might be the work of our guy .
thanks .
all right , so a homeless man found him .
i.d. &apos; d as harold mcdermott .
longtime local resident .
no attempt to hide the body this time , either .
our unsub might be unraveling .
must have been the new george henning .
hate to think what &apos;s swimming around in his bloodstream .
well , no obvious tissue removal .
bruising on his face and chest .
ah . thought i might find something like this is here .
medical i.d. card .
our victim suffered from epilepsy
and cortico @-@ basal degeneration .
i think we &apos;d better deliver the profile .
we believe we &apos;re looking
for a male between the ages of 25 and 35 .
he may have had some medical training ,
and he &apos;s able to contain
large quantities of controlled pharmaceuticals .
this guy &apos;s working off the legal and ethical grid ,
doing highly dangerous medical experimentation .
we believe he &apos;s searching for
a cure for degenerative neurological diseases ,
but we don &apos;t know why .
it could be personal .
either he or a loved one suffers from a disease
and it &apos;s a way to leapfrog conventional research
in an attempt to find a cure .
or it might not be personal at all .
this could be the unsub playing god ,
assuming the role of savior and rescuer of those in need .
another motive is old @-@ fashioned greed .
financial rewards for medical breakthroughs are substantial .
whatever the case ,
two divergent pathologies are at work in this unsub .
on the one hand , he does show signs of logic and reason ,
the scientific method of trial and error .
on the other hand , this person injected animal dna
into george henning &apos;s body ,
revealing an irrational , almost fantastical approach
to achieving his medical goals .
and this dichotomy may be evident in his everyday life .
he might appear charming and trustworthy ,
which allows him to abduct his victims with little or no difficulty .
but the other half of his jekyll and hyde personality
would clash with authority figures .
we believe that he had a conflict
with the medical establishment in the past .
we have reason to believe
that the most recent victim , andrea gambrell ,
is still alive .
the younger person is needed alive
to provide healthy blood .
but a new sick subject to receive that blood
will almost certainly be sought out .
postmortem violence found on the most recent victim
is a strong indicator that the killer is losing control .
this increased volatility is cause for concern .
if there are two voices in his head ,
the violent one is taking over .
listen , listen .
6 days and 7 nights
cruising the fjords of norway .
it sounds like fun .
what we do is fly into oslo ,
cruise up and down the coast ,
and it says if we go in winter ,
there &apos;s a good chance of seeing the northern lights .
you &apos;ve always wanted to see the northern lights .
i &apos;m sorry .
for what ?
letting you down .
we were gonna do so many things and then i got sick .
no . no , no , don &apos;t say that .
listen to me , ben .
when i &apos;m gone , i want you to continue on .
eileen--
no , i mean it .
i want you to live the life that we talked about .
i &apos;ll be there with you .
you are going to get better ,
and we are going to see the northern lights , together .
i should sleep now .
of course , sweetheart .
i &apos;m sorry . you get your rest .
who is it ?
mr. kebler , my name is robert boles .
i &apos;m from the hospital .
can we talk ?
i have something that could save your wife .
garcia was able to locate one of the former members
of this mad scientist club , diane haller .
she &apos;s coming in to talk to lewis .
the m.e. found more animal dna in george henning &apos;s body .
sea urchin and some type of tropical parrot .
what the hell &apos;s next ,
emulsified auto parts ?
unless the unsub &apos;s having a complete psychotic break ,
these transfusions have to make some sense medically .
i &apos;ve done some dr. reid research since he &apos;s on leave .
jellyfish have been used to treat cardiovascular disease ,
but not something like parkinson &apos;s .
well , maybe the unsub &apos;s looking beyond neurology--
he &apos;s trying to cure a wider range of diseases .
these creatures he &apos;s using , they &apos;re exotic .
hard to acquire , difficult to maintain .
well , there are a number of private zoos in the region .
i &apos;ll have garcia look into it .
why should i trust you ? you &apos;re not even a doctor .
a doctor can &apos;t offer you what i &apos;m offering .
because it &apos;s not legal , right ?
if your wife is cured , do you care if you broke a few rules ?
this treatment you &apos;re talking about ,
what does it involve ?
transfusions .
of what ?
a formula that i &apos;ve been working on .
oh , this sounds too risky .
mr. kebler , if you do nothing ,
your wife will die .
what are you risking ?
if i agreed ,
when would it start ?
right now .
i have everything i need in my vehicle .
so , the mad scientist club . it sounds interesting .
yeah , it was fun .
what did you guys talk about ?
um , advancements in medical research mostly .
stem cell , chromatin looping .
honestly , it was more of a drinking club after the first hour .
i &apos;m curious , why the cemetery ?
it made it spookier .
we were talking about all this out there kind of stuff , you know ?
was there anyone in the group
who made you feel uncomfortable ?
someone who gave off an odd vibe ?
there was this one guy .
he only came a couple times ,
but he gave everyone the creeps .
how so ?
he started going off about how we were in a magical place
and none of us realized because only he was from around here .
we called him the magic man .
do you remember his actual name ?
richard or robert , maybe .
how about a last name ?
no . sorry .
what do you think he meant by &quot; magical place &quot; ?
i have no idea .
like i said , he only came a few times and that was it .
no one ever saw him again .
hello .
done , ma &apos;am .
you should try and get some rest .
thank you so much .
i &apos;ll check back in later to see how you &apos;re doing .
your wife will need another transfusion in 3 days .
when will we see results ?
there are a lot of unknowns ,
but it could be soon .
very soon .
is he gone ?
yes . how are you feeling ?
tired .
i wonder , why didn &apos;t dr. braga tell us about this
when we were in her office ?
well , uh , she &apos;s a busy woman .
it must have slipped her mind .
garcia , look , i need you to check something out for me .
it is not much to run with , but ...
mm , i will be the judge of that . gimme , gimme .
all right , we &apos;re looking for a student ,
first name richard or robert , no last name ,
who attended the florida college of medicine in jacksonville
at the time that the mad scientist club was active .
richard or robert and no last name .
so my judgment is that bartholomew
or oglethorpe with no last name would be easier ?
well , his interest may have been in neuroscience ,
and he claims he was from the area .
that helps , milady . so love to you , my sneakers are on ,
i &apos;m running with this .
honey , is everything ok ?
the strangest thing .
i feel much better .
you do ?
that medicine that dr. braga prescribed ,
i think it &apos;s working .
i can &apos;t believe it .
maybe we could take a short walk ,
just to the corner .
i haven &apos;t felt the air on my face for so long .
what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m calling security .
how are you feeling ?
happy .
it &apos;s a miracle .
well , i &apos;m not cured yet ,
but this is the closest i &apos;ve felt
to my old self in months .
well , i &apos;m never letting you go .
i love you , ben .
dr. laura braga ,
last seen by a co @-@ worker about 8 : 00 last night .
she was heading back to the office
to grab some files she &apos;d forgotten .
i &apos;m guessing the blood is hers .
i wonder how he got her out of here
with no one noticing .
she &apos;s a neurologist .
there &apos;s the connection .
the unsub could have gotten extra levodopa from here .
better check to see if she was george henning &apos;s
or harold mcdermott &apos;s physician .
and we should also check her current patients .
if this is where the unsub is getting his victims ,
one of them could be next .
well , garcia compiled a list of every medical student
in the north florida area
with the first name of richard or robert ,
and i gotta tell you guys , it is a long list .
so which one is our magic man ?
what &apos;s up , rossi ?
they identified the bird dna in henning
as coming from a scarlet macaw .
mm @-@ hmm . and ?
that got me thinking about turritopsis dohrnii .
turri ... what ?
it &apos;s called the immortal jellyfish .
endlessly recycles its own cells
through a process called transdifferentiation ,
a kind of lineage reprogramming .
oh , my goodness .
dr. spencer reid , master of disguise .
no disguise . i called the kid last night .
but think about it .
jellyfish , turtles , sea urchin ,
and now scarlet macaw .
what do they all have in common ?
a long lifespan .
exactly .
longer than a human &apos;s .
so it means the unsub
may not be focused on a specific disease ,
but longevity .
oh , god . guys , i think i know why the magic man
thought this place is so magical .
we are right around the corner
from the legendary fountain of youth .
please , please let me go .
i @-@ i swear i won &apos;t tell anybody .
you &apos;re beautiful .
your face is so youthful .
don &apos;t .
smooth and perfect .
soft , like it should be .
you know ...
when i was 7 years old ,
i went with my parents to visit an uncle
who was living in a nursing home .
i got lost for a minute .
i went into the wrong room by mistake .
i thought it was my uncle , but ... it wasn &apos;t .
he was terrible @-@ looking .
his face , it hardly looked human .
and then he said ...
what are you staring at , boy ?
i couldn &apos;t answer , but i couldn &apos;t stop looking at him either .
and then he said ,
i &apos;ll tell you what you &apos;re staring at .
a mirror .
no matter what you do ,
you &apos;ll end up just like me .
just like me .
for months after that
i would check my face in the mirror every day
to see if it was happening yet .
you were just a child .
you didn &apos;t know any better .
but the old man was right .
i knew unless i did something ,
i &apos;d end up like that .
everybody would .
people get old .
it &apos;s natural .
no .
the answer is right here ,
practically under our feet .
it has been for centuries .
i need to apologize , andrea .
apologize ?
i lied to you before .
about what ?
that i wasn &apos;t going to hurt you .
no , no . stop !
ben .
honey , what &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s me , ben kebler .
something &apos;s gone wrong .
what &apos;s the matter ?
my wife is having trouble breathing .
i &apos;m going to call 911 .
no !
i have to . she &apos;s sick .
she needs help .
she needs another transfusion , that &apos;s all .
well , then you come over here now and you give her one .
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
it &apos;s safer if we do the transfusions at my lab .
what &apos;s going on ?
does this have something to do with what happened to dr. braga ?
the only chance your wife has is with me .
now , here are the directions to my lab .
hey , i got garcia on the line . she &apos;s got something .
what is it , garcia ?
sir , you were right about the scarlet macaw .
they are very hard to find .
when you can find one , they &apos;re real pricey .
however , a private zoo outside of st. augustine
reported a macaw stolen .
the owner suspected it to be a former employee ,
but they didn &apos;t have any proof .
i checked out this former employee ,
bobby boles , bobby being short for robert ,
robert maybe being our mad scientist .
did robert boles ever go to medical school ?
yeah , he totally did . he flunked out
in the middle of his first year , though .
he &apos;s always been sort of a misfit , it seems .
how so ?
he was home @-@ schooled from an early age
&apos;cause he didn &apos;t fit in with other kids .
lots of childhood therapy .
what did boles do after he dropped out of med school ?
lots of part @-@ time jobs .
he currently works as an orderly
at the same hospital as dr. braga .
where is he now ?
uh , i can &apos;t find a physical address .
he hasn &apos;t had one for a while . i &apos;ll keep searching .
look , he &apos;s probably long gone ,
but we can see if boles
reports for his next shift at the hospital .
he might not know we &apos;re onto him .
only one of dr. braga &apos;s patients didn &apos;t show up
for their scheduled appointment in the last two days--
eileen kebler .
we need to check her residence .
down this way at the end of the hall .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s a former medical research facility .
it &apos;s been closed up for years . i &apos;m leasing a section .
no ! she needs help , real help .
there &apos;s no time for anything else .
she needs a transfusion , now .
stay here . don &apos;t leave this room .
i &apos;ll bring what we need .
hurry !
i should have thought of this before .
it &apos;s not just medicine .
it &apos;s not just the ingredients .
it &apos;s the entire belief system .
it has to be something the aztecs ...
they-- they were here first , before anyone else .
they understood ...
the power of the beating heart .
don &apos;t .
when this is all through ,
people will remember you
and the sacrifice you made .
your name will be linked with mine for all eternity .
hotch , i think i got something .
what is it ?
it &apos;s garcia &apos;s list of recent
saltwater aquarium customers .
is robert boles on the list ?
no , but he could have used a fake name .
it &apos;s where one shipment was delivered .
the parking lot of a closed medical facility .
ok , thanks , garcia .
all right , so , in high school robert boles
got a summer job at a gift shop
near the fountain of youth archaeological park .
he got fired for breaking in after @-@ hours .
maybe that &apos;s where the obsession with eternal youth started .
hold on , eileen . it &apos;s gonna be ok .
it &apos;s cold .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m getting an ambulance .
no ! you should have stayed where you were .
what are you doing ?
you want your wife to recover or not ?
you &apos;re not touching my wife .
i &apos;m gonna cure her ,
and i won &apos;t let you get in the way .
robert boles , drop the weapon .
it &apos;s over , man . you &apos;re not getting out .
put the knife down , slowly .
my wife needs help .
where is she ?
‭ - in the next room .
show me .
call an ambulance , please .
i can do my research from prison .
no one can stand in the way of the future !
it &apos;s ok . ‭
you &apos;re ok .
you &apos;re ok .
it &apos;s ok . you &apos;re ok .
medics are on the way .
how is she ?
what have i done ?
i &apos;m cold .
eileen , stay with me .
i &apos;m always with you .
always .
&quot; the first condition of immortality is death . &quot;
stanislaw lec .
ice cream bad ,
yogurt good .
yogurt with ice cream , best .
well done , penelope .
you &apos;re making--
you &apos;re making excellent choices .
you &apos;re talking to yourself way too much these days .
but who wouldn &apos;t ? i &apos;m cooped up in here all by myself .
garcia .
sir , you scared me .
you need to come with me right now .
