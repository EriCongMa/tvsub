what did they do to us ?
no , please don &apos;t do this !
&quot; one month ago , my friends were kidnapped
&quot; by a faceless , nameless coward ,
the same monster who attacked mona vanderwaal . &quot; &apos;
it &apos;s coming from underground .
what &apos;s your name ?
i &apos;m sara harvey .
we know who it is .
it &apos;s andrew , babe .
and we &apos;re gonna get him .
andrew &apos;s been obsessed with the girls since ali went missing .
... &quot; ritual . sister launched lair . a ruler &apos;s list chained . &quot;
they &apos;re all anagrams .
for charles dilaurentis .
some of those toys in ali &apos;s room were hers
but some of them were his .
who is charles dilaurentis ?
where is mona ?
she &apos;s down the hall .
and that other girl is down there too , sara harvey .
what about andrew ?
what about him ?
i heard them talking in my ambulance ..
about how they found plans and journals in andrew &apos;s house
at the farm where he left the van .
andrew campbell and charles dilaurentis are the same person .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying , right ?
we &apos;re not just saying it , it &apos;s reality .
reality &apos;s been through a lot , and so have we .
you guys , it makes perfect sense .
andrew &apos;s always just been there on the edge of things .
always there , helping .
makes me sick just thinking about it .
so when do we tell the police about charles ?
we don &apos;t .
we don &apos;t ?
the cops will know if it &apos;s true .
it is true , spencer .
they &apos;ll know andrew is charles when they find him .
jeez , toby . listen to me .
give me five minutes .
walk away !
not gonna happen .
do your job .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law .
you had no right to put yourself in that much danger .
i wanted to help .
i did help . we saved them .
you had no obligation .
yes , i did .
it &apos;s over .
they &apos;ll catch that pervert campbell
and that &apos;ll be the end of it .
it &apos;s been a very long day .
the important thing is you &apos;re safe .
maybe .
who is charles dilaurentis ?
what ?
not what , who ?
someone asked me about charles dilaurentis .
and i didn &apos;t recognize the name .
do we have a charles dilaurentis in our family ?
no .
no one ..
... ever ?
no charles dilaurentis in this family .
well , then i guess that person made a mistake .
i &apos;m not asleep .
hi .
hi .
who are you ?
i &apos;m emily .
you &apos;re emily ?
you were down there .
yeah .
with my friends .
have you talked to your parents ?
just my mother .
we talked on the phone .
she cried .
how did you end up there ?
i ran away .
i was ... in a parking lot near rosewood .
i hit my head .
or someone hit me on the head .
then i was down there .
then i thought , well ..
now you know what happens to bad little girls .
did you see who grabbed you ?
did you hear his voice ?
i &apos;m tired .
we got the son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch .
andrew .
you caught him ?
we tracked him all over tyler park finally flushed him out .
are you sure he &apos;s the one ?
we &apos;ve been chasing him since we found
the prison van at his uncle &apos;s farm .
they traced all that electronic gear to him .
they found a journal about how he hated mona
and how he thought alison and the rest of you represented
the &quot; feminization of society . &quot;
it was a regular manifesto .
has he confessed ?
not yet .
if he &apos;s smart , he will .
this town doesn &apos;t need another trial .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i &apos;ll let you get back to sleep .
i was asleep .
actual , real sleep .
i haven &apos;t had that in a long time .
we never gave up .
i &apos;m alright .
really .
no , i understand .
the army isn &apos;t nine to five .
do you wanna talk to mom again ?
okay . love you . bye .
he &apos;ll talk to you tonight .
let &apos;s get outta here .
i jusp in sara &apos;s room and say goodbye .
well , she &apos;s gone , honey .
i saw her leaving with her mother
when i got off the elevator .
her mom came for her ?
i &apos;m assuming it was her mother .
i didn &apos;t really talk to &apos; em .
you know , the police said that sara
had been down there for over two years .
it &apos;s okay now .
sorry .
no , it &apos;s fine .
think about what you want for dinner and i &apos;ll order .
anything , as long as it &apos;s delivery .
i &apos;m not leaving you alone .
okay .
there are a lot of these .
yeah , it &apos;s mostly antibiotics and supplements , and ..
... something in case i feel anxious .
can &apos;t imagine why i &apos;d need that .
too early for sarcasm ?
not where i come from .
i thought i &apos;d stay for a couple nights .
yeah , it would be good .
your father is dealing with the police .
he &apos;s talked to all the other parents and we &apos;ve all agreed
that no one has to talk to the police until you guys are ready .
i &apos;m ready .
i &apos;ll do it today .
no , you won &apos;t .
mom , i wanna make sure that andrew doesn &apos;t get out .
there &apos;s time for that .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t wanna wait .
he &apos;s not gonna hurt me or anybody else ever again .
i will make sure of that .
why don &apos;t you come downstairs ? help me make some tea .
yeah , i will in a minute .
okay .
i spoke to my friend in the prosecutor &apos;s office .
there &apos;s little chance of mona being charged
for faking her death and causing alison &apos;s arrest .
they &apos;d just as soon blame everything on the campbell boy .
nice and tidy .
something &apos;s wrong .
they made a mistake at the hospital .
they left out one of my prescriptions .
they &apos;re supposed to give me an anti @-@ anxiety medication
to help me sleep .
i asked them not to .
you asked them not to ?
spencer , you know you &apos;ve had some issues .
mom , they @-@ they gave me something at the hospital
and it was the first night in forever that i got
what a normal person would call sleep .
honey , you &apos;re home now . you &apos;re not in the hospital .
i can &apos;t believe that you did this .
it wasn &apos;t an easy decision .
okay , that makes me feel a lot better .
i will help you any way i can , but i &apos;m not gonna take
the chance of you having another problem .
mom , i need that prescription .
no , you want it .
there &apos;s a difference .
that &apos;s semantics .
that &apos;s the rule .
i &apos;m sorry if that sounds unfair
but i have to be firm on this and so do you .
i really am back home .
five .
four .
three .
two .
one .
spencer ,
he says there is no such person
as charles dilaurentis in our family .
ali , i &apos;m gonna say this is delicately as i can .
your father &apos;s a liar .
that was the delicate way ?
he didn &apos;t say , let me think
or ask you where you heard the name
or who asked about it , he just shut you down . why ?
i suppose you wanna go the police about this .
no . not really .
i don &apos;t wanna walk in to any more
police stations with any more theories .
let the cops figure it out .
figure what out ?
that i &apos;m somehow related to someone named
charles dilaurentis who really is andrew campbell ?
what do you think happened ?
the goblin snuck into the campbell house
and switched babies on them ?
we both know that there are more conventional ways
somebody can end up with more than two parents .
that &apos;s how you and i got to share a brother .
thank you .
for getting us out of that place .
you &apos;d have done the same for me .
do you need a warm @-@ up or ..
oh , sorry .
no , no , it &apos;s @-@ it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s just , um ..
the coffee &apos;s great .
okay .
um , maybe some company .
did i remember to thank you for saving my life ?
you did . verbally .
i &apos;m still waiting for that thank you card in the mail though .
yeah , i &apos;m still just looking for the right one .
something with kittens on it .
i was only in that place for a few minutes .
you were there a lot longer .
so this may seem like a overly simplistic question
but are you alright ?
i will be .
just remember to check in with yourself .
you have an advantage over most people , &apos; cause you can
write about it , you can put it down on paper .
i won &apos;t be doing that .
oh , no . no , i don &apos;t mean for public consumption .
a journal , just for yourself--
i just said , i don &apos;t wanna do that .
&apos;i don &apos;t wanna own it , i don &apos;t wanna memorialize it.&apos;
i don &apos;t wanna think about it being in a diary
somewhere in my room .
i want a nice , big wall between before and after .
i thought you liked this wallpaper .
i did . but now i don &apos;t .
okay . well , we &apos;ll take off the wallpaper .
did you figured out what you might want instead ?
i &apos;ll pick something out later , i just want all this gone .
you &apos;ll pick something later ?
what is wrong with you ?
hanna , i &apos;ve watched you spend 30 minutes
sorting fabric swatches .
don &apos;t you at least wanna look at some paint chips
see what you might want ?
no .
are you okay ?
i just wanna change my room , and i wanna change it now .
not just the wallpaper , everything .
hanna , when you were in that silo ..
... your room down there ..
that was not my room !
this is my room .
are you gonna help me or not ?
i &apos;ll do anything you want .
then help me with the steamer .
hey , congratulate me , i &apos;m a renter .
ah . you got that apartment ?
no more sleeping on mrs. granville &apos;s couch .
nice , civic @-@ minded lady , but those hummel figurines
kept staring at me .
toby ?
i saw you , i just wanted check in .
we haven &apos;t spoken since the other night .
been busy .
hello .
hi .
uh , alison , this is my new partner , lorenzo calderon .
lorenzo , this is alison dilaurentis .
pleasure .
so are you new in town ?
newish .
lorenzo is part of rosewood pd &apos;s fresh perspective .
that &apos;s me .
i spoke to spencer this morning .
good .
yeah , she seems okay .
you know , physically .
they went through a lot .
we all did .
how you doin &apos; ?
i &apos;m glad it &apos;s over .
me too .
it was nice to meet you , lorenzo .
it was great meeting you .
see you later .
so that &apos;s the famous alison dilaurentis .
that &apos;s her .
mom , i wanted to make a change .
kinda tired of all this stuff .
i get that .
so we can either sell it or give it away .
i understand .
but it &apos;s , you know too late
to have a yard sale tonight .
why don &apos;t you get a good night &apos;s sleep
and we can talk about this in the morning ?
uh , the bed is already kind of in the hall , actually .
what were you planning to sleep on tonight , honey ?
i don &apos;t know . the floor .
you &apos;re not gonna do that .
you can sleep with me , but the furniture , we can--
no , i can &apos;t look at it anymore .
it &apos;s ruined .
don &apos;t look at him , look at me .
how is it ruined ?
i just wanna make a change , okay ?
i want to get rid of some old furniture .
i said , don &apos;t look at him !
why do you keep looking back and forth ?
and why can &apos;t i just have something that i want ?
does that make me crazy ?
did you have a good time with hanna ?
that was jimmy from the gun range on the phone .
he called to tell me how happy he was to see you again .
he remembered you going there with your dad ..
and watching him teach you the right way to do things .
he did teach me the right way .
he &apos;d understand why i was there .
where did you find the combination ?
i didn &apos;t find it , i figured it out .
i promise you , you &apos;re not gonna figure out the next one .
i &apos;ve used dad &apos;s guns before .
never alone , emily .
that is not a rule in this house , that is the law .
you knew that , and yet you sneak up here and just--
you can &apos;t sneak in your own house .
this is not a debate .
that locker is off limits .
understand ?
emily , do you understand ?
yes , ma &apos;am .
emily ..
the last thing i wanna do is fight with you .
if you wanna talk about what happened--
not now .
if you wanna talk to somebody else
they gave me names of doctors at the hospital--
i &apos;m really tired .
maybe you should call paige
an @-@ and let her know what happened .
let her know you &apos;re okay .
i did talk to her .
she said she wanted to come back .
i told her not to .
i told her i was alright .
and she shouldn &apos;t have to come home .
not for me .
em--
paige did the right thing , leaving town .
i won &apos;t drag her back into this .
she deserves to be happy .
so do you .
hey , roomie . you forgot to make the bed .
i will .
a nice blank canvas here .
any idea what you wanna do with it ?
not yet . i just wanted to get rid of everything that was here .
well , maybe you can get together with
aria and spencer and emily .
go shopping together for some new things .
i don &apos;t wanna do that .
they &apos;re your friends .
doesn &apos;t mean i have to see them every second of every day .
han , please . when you were ...
i don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
caleb said you were in a room--
that was not my room . this is my room .
what happened to you ... in that room ?
nothing .
hannah , please .
he just played games with us .
what kind of games ?
truth or dare .
who do you love more , me or her ?
who deserves water today , you or somebody else ?
you decide or you lose your turn
and somebody else gets to pick .
lots and lots of games .
this is your room .
anything you want , baby .
you want beanbag chairs ..
danish modern , you want ... day @-@ glo wicker ...
you can have it .
there &apos;s circumstantial evidence against andrew campbell .
so much that we &apos;re having a hard time getting through it .
we have a paper @-@ trail connecting him
to the missile silo where you were held .
and the construction work that was done there .
how could a high school boy afford all of that ?
one of the things we &apos;d like to know and so would the irs .
but you can prove he &apos;s guilty ?
we &apos;re well on the way to proving it .
i &apos;ll do anything to help .
at any point in the time you were held hostage
did you actually see andrew campbell ?
yeah , we saw him , but he was masked .
then you didn &apos;t see him .
it was andrew .
he told me how much he hated mona .
he was always around when something happened
when my brother was attacked .
i mean , it was andrew that was in my house
pretending to help us so he could watch us .
all that may be true--
it is true .
we &apos;re exploring andrew &apos;s motives .
tracking a timeline that goes back years .
looking for confirmations and discrepancies .
but what we don &apos;t have is direct testimony
that someone saw andrew campbell
at the scene of a crime .
ultimately , that could decide
if he walks away or pays for what he &apos;s done .
i did see him .
once , i saw his face .
where ?
when i was down there
i , um , i saw him without his mask .
you just said he was always masked .
that was a mistake but i remember now .
i @-@ i saw him . it was andrew .
was anyone else with you when you saw his face ?
no , i was alone .
i saw him .
that @-@ that &apos;s what you wanna know .
that &apos;s what you need , right ?
i &apos;m telling you , i saw his face .
it was andrew campbell .
i wanna thank you both for coming in today .
it &apos;s been very helpful .
i &apos;m helpin &apos; buildin &apos; the case against andrew .
how &apos;s that going ?
it &apos;s lookin &apos; pretty strong .
pretty strong ?
what happened to &quot; we &apos;re gonna get the son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ bitch ? &quot;
the manifesto , the van , the electronics at the farm .
i &apos;ve been thinking about all that .
why hold onto the van ?
why not ditch it ?
and why keep it so close to where you &apos;re hiding ?
and why hide it some place you could be linked to ?
well , a is for arrogance .
when i caught andrew , i wanted to take him apart
because of what he did to you .
all i could think about was you in that place .
and i realized that i don &apos;t know what happened .
i was there . i saw it .
but never really talked about what happened .
why ?
choose one , or all will suffer .
no .
five , four ..
no .
three , two , one .
alison .
alison .
hi , lorenzo .
i know .
the first time we met , i was in uniform .
lot of people , that &apos;s all they see .
i remember you .
it was nice seein &apos; a familiar face .
i &apos;m still pretty new .
me too .
in church .
i used to go when i was a kid .
and then i didn &apos;t go .
and now ... i don &apos;t know .
yeah , that &apos;s how it was for me .
you go ,
then you get too smart for it .
then you start to wonder how smart you actually are .
i like the music .
yeah , the music &apos;s great .
i gotta go .
sure .
hey , don &apos;t worry .
about what ?
i won &apos;t tell anybody i saw you in church .
what makes you think i don &apos;t want people to know ?
i don &apos;t know . i just know that you don &apos;t .
you went back , after we talked .
after i changed the combination . you went back ?
you just said i couldn &apos;t use dad &apos;s ,
so i rented a gun .
seriously , emily ?
i need to know what &apos;s going on with you .
dad &apos;s defending people ,
why can &apos;t i defend us ?
because this has nothing to do with defending anything
and you know it .
you never bring anger to a firing range . ever !
i &apos;m not angry .
i saw you , emily !
they said we were down there for three weeks .
is that right ?
it was a little bit longer than that .
well , it felt like ..
i don &apos;t know what it felt like .
after a while there wasn &apos;t any time anymore .
that girl , sara . you saw her .
did you see her eyes ?
her eyes ?
did you look at her eyes ?
i did .
she was down there for years .
and you could see that in her eyes .
what would have happened if i &apos;d been down there for years ?
emily , the person who did this is behind bars .
you mean , there isn &apos;t any more bad people out there ?
there &apos;s nobody who &apos;s ever gonna hurt anybody again ?
a gun isn &apos;t gonna change that .
not for you , not for anyone .
i know .
i was afraid .
and i thought ..
... maybe it could take away some of the fear .
but it didn &apos;t .
it made it worse .
it makes you the same as what you &apos;re afraid of .
honey , i &apos;m sorry .
and i screwed up on a global scale .
i mean , i just .. i wanted to help .
i just wanted it to be over with .
i mean , there were whole parts of my brain
that were trying to stop me from lying
and the stupid parts won .
yeah , well , the stupid brain is small , but it &apos;s wily .
i might as well have opened the cell door
and let andrew walk out .
no , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s as bad as that .
it &apos;s not good .
no , it &apos;s not good .
but i understand the impulse .
anyway , thanks for coming over .
yeah , thank you for calling me .
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry for what ?
so hanna called and she thinks that
we should all go to school tomorrow .
yeah , um , that &apos;s not a bad idea .
just--
aria !
can i borrow you for a second ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;ll be right back .
okay .
alright , there you go .
thank you .
at least now my mom can have her privacy back .
how &apos;s it feel ?
well , like i &apos;m about to be boxed and shipped .
have i ever told you that
i think you &apos;re the bravest person i &apos;ve ever met ?
i don &apos;t think so .
but you can try it .
you &apos;re the bravest person i &apos;ve ever met .
i like it .
it &apos;s not true , but i like the sound of it .
it is true .
and you &apos;re gonna get through this .
you and your friends .
how is that gonna happen when i &apos;m having a hard time
looking them in the eye ?
you will .
that &apos;s what people do , they mend .
you taught me that .
and sometimes you end up stronger at the broken places .
do you know what i want ?
what ?
i want my night table back .
i &apos;m sorry if i was rude to you in front of church .
i &apos;m embarrassed about it .
not embarrassed about going .
embarrassed about what people might think .
i &apos;m sure toby , he &apos;s told you plenty about me .
so you can understand why people seeing me at church
would say , &quot; she &apos;s just there for show &quot;
or maybe , &quot; she went crazy in jail . &quot;
which is not true , really . either one .
would you like one of these little hamburgers ?
thanks .
i &apos;m gonna leave in just a minute .
stay awhile , let her sleep .
i &apos;ve been sitting in the other room
trying to come up with a way to ask you
about what happened today at the police station .
well , i think you just did .
do you wanna talk about it ?
oh , i think i &apos;ve said enough , don &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ve done enough damage , talking .
i &apos;m just gonna stick to the visuals from now on .
the police talked to us
after they brought you out of that place .
they told us what it was like . not in detail .
so you didn &apos;t see ?
no .
good .
we all want the person who did that to you
caught and punished .
we may want different levels of that punishment
but it &apos;s what we all want .
it was him .
it was andrew . it has to be andrew .
aria , you &apos;re very smart .
but please remember , you &apos;re also very wise .
sara ?
i saw your address in the hospital .
i didn &apos;t know where to go .
what happened ?
i ran away .
she was happy to see you . your mom . she must have been .
maybe it was just really hard for her to show you
because you were gone so long .
when i was gone ..
... people were very sympathetic with my mother .
they paid attention to her .
then i came home and i spoiled everything .
i should &apos;ve stayed in that hole .
don &apos;t say that .
i should have .
i was finally doing something to make my mother happy .
well , no one &apos;s goin &apos; anywhere tonight .
you can stay , sara ,
but we &apos;ve gotta call your mother .
you can try .
alright , i &apos;ll make up the sofa .
okay .
it &apos;ll be alright .
don &apos;t think about that place . it &apos;s all over .
we &apos;re gonna get some justice now .
emily , that guy they caught ..
andrew . what about him ?
i saw him on tv .
are you sure it &apos;s him ?
have you got any sleep ?
uh , no , but i &apos;ll be okay . don &apos;t worry .
what are you doing ?
we &apos;ll sit up together , and watch a movie
until we both fall asleep , okay ?
okay .
