we &apos;re not a trauma center or a teaching hospital --
you did the best you could .
he saved all those people .
and it was my job ...
to save him .
and i failed .
and now ...
he &apos;s gonna die ...
... because i was not a good enough doctor ...
... to keep him alive .
occupied !
hurry up ! there are people in the other ones !
i &apos;m in here !
i sw-- i &apos;m gonna pee on your floor !
god , i think i &apos;m being punished for having sex .
amazing , regrettable ,
but admittedly very hot sex with an intern .
and if we &apos;ve learned anything from slasher movies ,
it &apos;s that people who have sex get tortured and punished ...
... and raging u.t.i.s ! oh , god !
why aren &apos;t you cooking ? ! you &apos;re supposed to be cooking !
i am being tortured . i have a u.t.i.
well , get some pyridium and get back in the game !
i &apos;m going to the hospital .
what ? ! no , you can &apos;t .
it &apos;s a u.t.i. ! woman up !
a u.t.i. and what else ? i don &apos;t know this guy .
i keep a very clean house down there ,
and right now , my house is on fire .
god knows where he &apos;s been !
he looks like he gets a lot of sex -- a lot !
with whom ?
skanks , perhaps ?
i mean , statistically ,
there was probably a skank or two in there .
he could &apos;ve brought anything into my house .
god , i feel toxic . i need -- i need to go to the hospital .
i need a battery of tests and a silkwood shower .
no , i @-@ i @-@ i just -- i want to feel clean .
think like a chef .
you have to cook ! we have guests !
no one wants me touching their food .
we have a house full of starving surgeons !
you can &apos;t just leave !
watch me .
maggie !
amelia , what if it &apos;s an std ?
oh , gosh , i &apos;ve moved all over --
three naval bases in the states , guam , bahrain .

it &apos;s the hospital . this is dr. torres .
my , mom &apos;s a petroleum seismologist .

do you want to do this now ,
or can we , like , just be at a party ?

oh , can i steal her for a minute ?
thanks . excuse me .
i met her .
penny !
jackson &apos;s staying at bailey &apos;s .
i don &apos;t hate her .
i like her . i like her a lot .

okay , scale of 1 to 10,
how badly does this party suck so far ?
like 1 sucks most or 10 sucks most ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s one of those .
come on !
look , i only came here for the free food . there &apos;s no food .
your guests are making the dinner .

i &apos;m feeling a little light @-@ headed .
and i have a thing in the morning .
see ? it &apos;s a 1 or a 10 .

i know that this is a really tight bunch
and it is easy to feel stuck outside ,
but once they get to know you , you have friends for life .
they &apos;re nice .
we &apos;re nice .
yeah .
we &apos;re very nice .

i &apos;m -- i &apos;m sure it &apos;s just a u.t.i.
here .
pyridium -- two tablets , three times a day
with cranberry juice .
effective and delicious .
um , i &apos;m going to wait for the test results to come back .
i &apos;d rather hear it from science than from you .
look , if it &apos;s burning , it &apos;s a u.t.i.
or it &apos;s chlamydia or gonorrhea or any of the &quot; ias . &quot;
who do you think i am ?
i don &apos;t know who you are .
that &apos;s the point .
yeah , i don &apos;t know you either , okay ?
but you &apos;re the one who shows up with a burning --
watch it .
you know , i could assume that you might &apos;ve given me something ,
but i don &apos;t do that , do i ?
no . i don &apos;t immediately call you a slut .
‭ you &apos;re right .
i &apos;m sorry .
thank you .
‭ i thought that was for me .
right .
sorry .
hey , wait . so , you knew about this ?
no , i knew her name . that &apos;s all .
webber handles the residents . it was a mid @-@ term match .
so she &apos;s gonna be a resident with us ?
come on .
penny , what &apos;s she talking about ?
i tried to tell you .
when ? when did you ever --
when we got here .
yeah , so , tell us now . tell me what happened .
wait .
penny , you don &apos;t -- you don &apos;t have to .
can you and i talk ?
that is a @-@ a good idea , actually .

she was there !
can we just -- - i want to hear what happened .
did you make a mistake ?
did you -- - amelia ...
tell me what happened !
i was the resident on call that night , in trauma .
we were understaffed .
five came in with him .
and her husba--
your brother had flail chest .
my brother died of a brain bleed .
no .
there was a scalp laceration but no step @-@ off .
he was bleeding into his chest .
a choice was made to skip c.t.
i thought he needed one .
i should &apos;ve pushed harder .
hell yeah , you should have .
and ...
and then i was stuck waiting
on a neuro attending who couldn &apos;t be bothered ...
i just sound like i am making excuses for myself .
i &apos;m very sorry .
i should just go .
tell me the rest .
tell me all of it .
amelia , come on .
i didn &apos;t get to see him .
you saw him before he went into surgery ,
you were the last one to see him .
you did .
amelia , t @-@ that &apos;s enough .
did he say anything to you ...
before you killed him ?
can you tell me what his last words were ?
that &apos;s enough .
get her out of my house .
so , what do you want to do ?
you want me to get her out of here ,
get everybody out ?
i don &apos;t know !
i &apos;m not gonna let them do this .
it &apos;s not gonna happen .
we will call a meeting of the board ,
and we &apos;ll have a vote , and we will fire that bitch !
we &apos;ll -- we &apos;re stopping this .
we &apos;re gonna take care of this , right ?
meredith ?
why aren &apos;t you saying anything ?
because i really --
i really don &apos;t want to talk about this .
yeah .
clearly .
you knew who she was all night ,
and you never bothered telling me ?
amelia ...
she killed derek !
you invite her in here .
y @-@ you let me sit there and talk to her all --
i -- well , i hugged her !
why ? ! w @-@ why would you do that to me ?
i did this to you ?
you should &apos;ve told me . you should have .
i thought that you and i --
i ... did ... nothing ... to you .
i lost my husband and the father of my children ,
and you &apos;re falling apart ?
i don &apos;t get to do that because i have three kids ,
so , please , shut up and get out of my room !
meredith ...
get her out of here before i kill her ! !
can you hold on one second ?
what &apos;s the address here ?
for the cab .
i still don &apos;t understand .
you were coming to work here .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
just ...
i &apos;ll call back .
it &apos;s a huge hospital .
callie , i didn &apos;t know if you knew him .
i didn &apos;t -- - &quot; knew him &quot; ?
he was my friend .
meredith , all of us .
he was the worst night of my life .
do you want me to call webber ?
maybe find a meeting ?
they can &apos;t do this .
they can &apos;t do this to me .
nobody did anything to you .
amelia , this was ...
... a terrible night for a lot of people , not just you .
i mean , look at meredith , callie .
look at -- look at penny .
whose side are you on ?
what ?
just ...
god ! how do you do that ?
how are you always so calm and reasonable
and logical and ... perfect ?
y @-@ you &apos;re perfect .
i am vomiting my life all over the place all the time ,
and nothing is ever wrong with you .
you &apos;re ...
why are you always so perfect ?
i &apos;m not .
okay ?
i &apos;m not perfect , not even close .
okay .
when the plane crashed ...
when i heard that cristina &apos;s plane had crashed ,
my first thought was she was dead .
and for a moment ...
... i felt relieved .
i felt terrible for feeling it , but it was there .
and i always knew on some level she &apos;d leave me ,
and i wasn &apos;t ready to be hurt like that .
so if she was dead ,
we would stay frozen in time forever .
and she &apos;d be gone , but it wouldn &apos;t be so hard .
it wouldn &apos;t be a choice ,
to walk away , to choose something else ,
to move to switzerland and start another life .
i was relieved that it was over with a minimum of damage ,
and i hate myself for that .
so i am not perfect , amelia .
i can be selfish , and i can be scared ,
and i make things harder than i need to .
i know i do . i make things hard for us .
that is the worst thing i have ever heard .
no , really , don &apos;t ever do drugs
because you will never be able to stop .
we &apos;re not perfect .
so what ?
has anybody seen her -- penny ?
i think she was waiting on a cab .
am i supposed to do anything ?
because callie &apos;s my ex ,
but on the other hand , you know , she &apos;s my ex , so i --
i &apos;m guessing that means no ?
i feel bad for her .
she was ambushed tonight . it wasn &apos;t right .
she &apos;s a resident , you know , just like us .
yeah , well , that could &apos;ve been any of us .
it was me .
my second year , i made a stupid mistake .
i missed an airway , and i killed a child &apos;s mother .
okay , you didn &apos;t kill anybody . it was mistake .
i still pray for her .
every night , i pray for her family .
well , that stuff is never one person &apos;s fault .
some things are just your fault .
some things you screw up and you can &apos;t take back ,
no matter how hard you try .
some things you pay for the rest of your life .
that &apos;s the last of it . i got to get her home .
you &apos;re not driving , either .
no , i know .
um , wilson got cross to take us home .
your dinner was excellent tonight .
thanks .
okay , you ready ?
okay . come on .
totally . oh !
whoo ! whoo , you got it .
yeah . okay .
come on .
i shouldn &apos;t have ratted you out to shepherd .
i overheard webber and her talking .
i know that you weren &apos;t lying .
i am really sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
i get it . i &apos;m sorry it happened , too .
so ...
alex is ignoring me .
i know -- jerk . - jerk !
‭ oh , god .
you can go .
what are you gonna do if i leave ?
now she &apos;s a person .
you okay ?
yeah . great .
sorry .
i mean ...
my good relationships started out as friends
and then became more .
and then , you know , died ...
‭ ... screaming .
god , dating sucks .
sucks !
see , my problem is getting a second date
because the first one usually gets to sex ,
but the cool women , the women i &apos;d like to see again ,
there &apos;s always some sort of automatic assumption
that i &apos;ve moved on .
yeah , i see that .
why ? why is that ?
for starters , uh ...
your hair ...
it &apos;s very confident .
and swoopy .
yeah , it reaches out to people .
and last night was ...
clearly not your first time at bat &apos; cause ...
you knocked it out of the park .
well , you pitched a perfect ... game ?
i don &apos;t know baseball .
how long does it take to , um ... get test results back ?
just go . i &apos;ll send you the results .
and if it makes you feel any better ,
if you want to know anything about my history , just ask .
i &apos;ll tell you anything .
i &apos;m not sure i want to know .
well , the only alternative is a little bit more difficult .
what ?
you just trust me .
go . i have to change .
right .
uh , you know that there &apos;s nothing
i haven &apos;t already seen , right ?
go !
oh , okay , okay .
just ditch karev .
i &apos;ll give you a ride .
honestly , i don &apos;t even think that he would notice .
no . no .
oh , god .
i &apos;m glad we talked .
today was ...
just ...
today sucked .
and ... i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m glad we didn &apos;t let that get in the way of our friendship .
i know . i know .
it makes sense now -- the way that you do things .
and you were sick , and i had a crappy childhood ,
but it made us even stronger , you know ?
we both had to work even harder to get to where we are .
i just -- i feel like i understand you more .
you understand me more because i was sick ?
i just don &apos;t understand why you didn &apos;t tell me .
you can &apos;t even wrap your mind around it , can you ?
that i might just be better at this than you are ,
that i might be stronger or smarter or more savvy .
you need a reason for me to have an edge up on you .
you need some deep , dark secret motivating me ,
operating circles around you .
you need an even playing field before you can be good with me .
okay . wow .
stop trying to make us even , jo , &apos; cause we &apos;re not even .
deal with your jealousy . deal with your shortcomings .
those are on you . don &apos;t put your crap on me .
everybody &apos;s gone ?
how was dinner ?
don &apos;t tell me . i have to pee .
hey , have you seen penny ?
no . sorry .
hey . was penny inside ?
i mean , i see her stuff out here ,
but i don &apos;t see her .
no , i don &apos;t -- i don &apos;t think so .
‭ i guess i thought she left .
i probably would &apos;ve .
what are the odds ?
that she &apos;s the one person i ...
i don &apos;t know how to do it . i don &apos;t know how to shut it off .
shut what off ?
how i feel ...
yeah . ... about her .
i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t even know if i want to .
well , even if you want to ,
i &apos;m not so sure that you can .
all right , get home safe , okay ?
you too .
you &apos;re sure you &apos;re okay ?
you want me to stay or -- or anything ?
i thought you said jo was waiting for you in the car ?
look , mer , i &apos;m being serious .
alex ...
i am fine .
i will be fine , so just go . it &apos;s okay .
okay .
night .
okay , um ...
i didn &apos;t know that you were down here .
i &apos;m leaving .
i called a cab .
i am so sorry about tonight .
i never would &apos;ve come if i &apos;d known .
tomorrow morning , i am gonna file a request
to be rematched with another program ,
and ... you will never have to see me again .
i want you to know that i didn &apos;t forget about him .
i never will .
what you said that night about your husband being my one --
i think about that night , about him ...
every day .
that &apos;s all .
i &apos;ll see you monday .
don &apos;t be late !
