thanks for helping me with my school dance .
&quot; love is forever ...
and ever ... and ever ... &quot;
how many &quot; and evers &quot; ?
technically , infinity ,
but i could only fit 12 .
wow , this is gonna be tough for you , huh ?
yes . foster said we couldn &apos;t afford it ,
but i really stuck my neck out for this dance .
no , i ... i mean
because the theme of the dance is
&quot; love is forever , &quot; and ...
nick , and the breakup ...
what ? no . cece , look .
you remember what school dances were like for me .
they were miserable .
i was just waiting in the bathroom
for tim keymaker to magically appear and ask me out .
i remember .
i was smoking in the stall next to you .
we get it ; you were bad .
i just don &apos;t want it to be like it was for me .
i want them to have an incredible time .
my life is a bit of a mess right now , but
the one thing i can do
is throw an amazing dance for them .
&quot; love is forever and ever ...
and ever . &quot;
what is , what is this ?
the theme of jess &apos; school dance .
that &apos;s pretty ironic , huh ?
jess , you poor thing .
come @-@ come here . come here .
what ?
what ?
just ... there .
what are you doing ?
all right .
uh @-@ huh . okay .
oh , i know . i know .
i know .
what &apos;s happening ?
i got hug number two locked and loaded .
soft or hard , it &apos;s up to you .
i know .
schmidt ...
ay @-@ ay @-@ ay , i needed a shvitz .
ech , me , too .
my arms are so sore .
i &apos;ve been doing so many push @-@ ups .
that seems like a lie .
no , i &apos;m trying to stay fit after the breakup .
i &apos;ve been eating salads .
you know , no dressing .
mostly just the protein .
what kind of salads you been eating ?
the little chopped @-@ up pieces of ham .
just the ham ?
yeah .
i don &apos;t like the lettuce .
i think it &apos;s gross to eat stuff that already ... it &apos;s green .
well , look , you know , baby steps .
it &apos;s not baby steps .
there are some pretty big pieces of ham .
okay . it &apos;s ... you know , it &apos;s good .
i @-@ i genuinely miss goofing around with jess .
breakups aren &apos;t supposed to be easy , so ...
wow , that &apos;s really mature of you , man .
we &apos;re doing something where we &apos;re ...
we &apos;re not allowed to be in a room alone
together without winston .
&apos;cause he just naturally takes the sexual tension out of a room .
what &apos;d you guys want ?
you see ? i &apos;m proud of you .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about . we &apos;re men .
we &apos;ve felt pain , we &apos;ve survived it .
look at me .
i &apos;m watching cece drool over some 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
how could she be interested in a boy
when she could have these ripe berries ?
look at these , nick .
put your towel down .
oh , god , i need a shvitz .
why does my sweat smell like asparagus ?
he does take all the sexual tension out of a room .
man , i heat up every room i walk into .
put me next to a dozen eggs .
they hatchin &apos; . you know why ?
&apos;cause i got the heat of a mother hen .
there was no sexual tension in here before he got here .
keep telling yourself that , nick .
congrats , chaperones !
with your help , tonight is going to be ... unforgettable .
i didn &apos;t sign up for this .
no , you didn &apos;t . none of you did .
in fact , none of you have ever , ever
signed up for any school event , ever .
which means you &apos;ve never felt the joy
of exchanging your free time
for a child &apos;s smile .
i never volunteer because of my munchausen syndrome .
are we getting paid ?
you will get paid , um , actually ,
in attractive hats that i made .
they say &quot; chaperone . &quot;
and gary the janitor has one
that says &quot; clean up crew . &quot;
you call me gary the janitor
as if me being a janitor
is my whole identity .
it &apos;s like someone calling you
jess the third @-@ hottest white teacher .
okay .
are we done ?
i &apos;m gonna say we &apos;re done .
yeah . okay .
thank @-@ thanks , guys . good @-@ good meeting .
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m supposed to be right now .
thanks , guys .
it &apos;s gonna be great !
you don &apos;t have to wear that , coach .
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,
this dance starts now .
i know how important this dance is to you .
those kids won &apos;t get away with anything .
if they want to bang ,
they &apos;re gonna have to bang through me .
wait .
if they want to bang ,
they &apos;re gonna have to bang through me !
wait .
hey , wendy .

my mom &apos;s making me go .
making you go
to the best night of your life ?
your mom sounds really cool .
come one , at your age , love is forever and ever and ever .
what are you gonna wear ?
this shirt .
that is
the best idea i &apos;ve heard all week .
whoa ! scary shirt !
we all think that you &apos;re an idiot
for dating this 14 @-@ year @-@ old .
he &apos;s 20 .
that means he was seven
when good will hunting came out .
seven , cece . good will hunting .
you know what ? let me go , let me go , let me go .
um , check this out . cece &apos;s boyfriend
is so young that ...
it &apos;ll come back to me .
buster is more of a man than all of you .
okay ? he &apos;s been to , like , 40 countries ,
he builds boats ,
he used to train snakes with his uncle .
earning a respectable wage ,
wearing a proper @-@ hanging pair of slacks ,
ordering sushi like a sick @-@ ass boss ...
these things a man maketh .
so stupid stuff that you do .
i know that technically you guys are men ,
but all you do is hang out with each other ,
like you &apos;re 12 .
what do you know ?
you &apos;re just a stupid girl .
okay , i got it , i got it .
okay , cece &apos;s boyfriend is so young that ...
how @-@ how young is he ? &apos; cause everybody wants to know .
winston .
it &apos;s not working , man . i &apos;m serious .
i &apos;m at my wit &apos;s end with you .
what ?
wait a minute .
why &apos;s the door locked ?
the dance starts in five minutes .
okay .
gary !
thank god you &apos;re here . can you unlock the door ?
no . i didn &apos;t put that there .
what ?
who else could have done it ?
we can &apos;t start the dance
if the door &apos;s locked .
don &apos;t tell me i wore my raw denim
for no reason-- don &apos;t you dare tell me that !
i am not telling you that .
so the dance is cancelled , then ?
no , no , no . there is gonna be a dance .
it &apos;s gonna be great and perfect and lovely
and it will celebrate love is forever and ever and ever .
where are you guys going ?
in life , nowhere .
but i know i don &apos;t want to be here .
guys , please stay . it would really mean a lot to me .
boring .
it &apos;s jess . all of her chaperones just bailed ,
and she needs help .
a lady needs help ?
is that a job for ... a boy ?
no .
or a ...
man !
man ?
men ! men ! men !
men ! men ! men ! men ! men !
well , the dummy patrol is ready .
men ! men ! men !
men . man !
so stupid .

dude , rub his shoulder . rub his shoulder .
i &apos;ll get ice . i &apos;ll get ice .
my shoulder go into his . you all right ?
ow , man !
okay , all right , just sit back .
nick , get the ice !
how do you know how to do that ?
well , a tire iron is actually strong enough to break through
a high @-@ carbon steel steering wheel lock ,
so , you know , i figured i &apos;d work with this .
cece scares me sometimes .
it &apos;s just the tip of the iceberg , my friend .
got it . there we go .
oh ! yes !
now we &apos;re cooking with gas .
yes !
everything &apos;s back on track , guys !
this bike lock was a real punk move .
seems like there &apos;s a lot of punks here . did you do this ?
hey . did you do this ? huh ?
did you do this ?
hey , easy , easy .
if anyone &apos;s messing with this dance ,
it &apos;s one of those teachers--
those hats were begging for payback .
let &apos;s do this .
listen up , chaperones .
you will obey all of my instructions .
this means everything to jess .
your asses belong to me now .
which means i currently have four asses .
the three of yours and mine .
i think we &apos;re capable of handling
a bunch of prepubescent kids .
do you think you are tough , winston ?
you have no idea
what these little bastards are capable of .
i mean , i love them .
i love them with all my heart .
but they will hurt your feelings sometimes .
he &apos;s right . i remember
sticks and stones may break your bones ,
but not if you &apos;re a fat kid with calcium deficiency .
schmidt , you &apos;re on snack table duty . keep the chip bowls full .
don &apos;t let the kids spike the punch .
and make sure diabetic amy
only has four cookies .
diabetic amy ain &apos;t gonna get no cookies on my watch .
no , she @-@ she has to have at least two or she &apos;ll pass out .
she &apos;s getting nothing as far as i &apos;m concerned .
at least two , at least two or she &apos;ll pass out .
all right , winston ?
yes , sir .
dance floor duty .
ooh , you shouldn &apos;t have said that , man ,
that is the perfect place for me right now .
i got so much heat coming off me , man .
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no . no heat .
no heat .
none . hey , look at me . no heat .
the opposite of heat . six inches separation at all times .
nobody &apos;s getting pregnant tonight .
that &apos;s the same thing i say on my dates .
not cool .
let &apos;s hit it .
saving the best for last ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry , nick , uh ,
you &apos;re not chaperone material .
i &apos;ve been at this job for a few weeks now
and i know the stink of a bad kid .
that makes me the perfect candidate to be a chaperone ,
coach . just think about it .
i can get in the mind of a bad kid .
i can get think like &apos; em . i can go deep . i can go too deep .
i &apos;m gonna put you in the parking lot to sweep for stragglers .
you want me on the streets .
it &apos;s not that important of a job .
i won &apos;t let you down .
i &apos;m not gonna let you down !
you taking a ... a break right now ?
when the heat moves you , you got to move ...
okay , no heat . no heat .
no heat , bishop , no heat .

huh ? yeah . yeah , yeah . you got that , man .

what are you looking at ?
cool mustache .
too much heat .
too much heat .
all right , kids , let &apos;s use the serving tongs .
this isn &apos;t appalachia .
hurry up , everybody , before justin eats everything .
son , i ...
don &apos;t think you meant to hurt
justin &apos;s feelings , there .
what &apos;s going on , really ?
are the parents fighting at home ?
leave me alone , flamer .
flamer ?
you &apos;re the ... you &apos;re the flamer , pal .
you &apos;re the flamer .
you &apos;re the flamer .
flamer .
stop saying that word , it &apos;s prob ...
probably offensive to some people , you flamer .
flamer .
yeah , take a doughnut , there , you flamer .
flamer .
schmidt . i got a bit of a situation here .
um , thoughts ? advice ?
what now ?
aw , son of a b ... penis .
ah , that wasn &apos;t better .
sorry , everyone .
you were right .
someone &apos;s trying to mess with my dance .
hmm . it &apos;s paste .
and it &apos;s fresh .
banana in the dark .
you ruined my dance .
i can smell the paste . perpetrator .
he &apos;s in there .
okay , when we get in there ,
i &apos;m going to be good cop , you be bad cop , okay ?
got it .
there are two ways this can go .
number one :
you tell us why you ruined the dance .
number two : i bash your skull in with a carburetor !
i thought i was bad cop .
you are the bad cop .
i &apos;m the tough , competent cop , who &apos;s good at her job ,
you &apos;re the kind of fumbly , dumb cop who &apos;s ...
who &apos;s nice and ...
yeah , that &apos;s not how it works , though .
i mean , the good cop is nice and the bad cop is mean .
that would be nice cop , mean cop .
it &apos;s how it works on every cop show , when you watch it .
i watch cop shows .
you need to pay more attention .
i do pay attention ...
what do you awful women want ?
we want to know ...
why you locked the door and poured glue in the breaker .
i didn &apos;t do any of that .
why would anybody want to ruin such a magical night ?
uh , you &apos;re the only one who wanted to have this stupid dance .
revenge would be my guess .
what do you know ?
well , you have the grip of a much taller woman .
and i don &apos;t not like that .
some fireworks or something .
what &apos;s up , gentlemen ?
just hanging out outside in the parking lot ?
we &apos;re not doing anything . we don &apos;t need a chaperone .
calling me a &apos; rone ?
i &apos;m not a &apos; rone . i &apos;m basically the same guy as you .
we &apos;re wearing the same shirt .
i &apos;m a good guy , i &apos;m having fun . i &apos;m just ...
i &apos;m bored in there , i &apos;m looking to hang out .
is that a crime , officers ?
say , you guys got any billy whizz ?
any juice , any sweet mary jane ? i &apos;m looking .
okay , if you &apos;re really not a chaperone ...
why don &apos;t you take a sip of this ?
maybe i will , maybe i won &apos;t . i got nothing to prove .
are you a &apos; rone or not ?
give me that .
what is that ? is that a suicide ?
the soda flavors all mixed together .
you know it , bro .
that was super intense .
sorry , i spit some of it up .
he &apos;s cool .
hey , buddy , uh , tommy , is it ?
i just ... i just wanted to apologize
what , are you gonna propose to me , now ?
that &apos;s funny . no , i ... i get it . you know , when i ...
when i was young , i too found that humor can be a useful tool .
dude , get up , i &apos;m not gonna marry you .
i , too , found that humor can be a ... a useful tool .
and then you grow up and you become a man .
well , you smell like a woman .
that &apos;s it , enough is enough with you .
you think you &apos;re a tough guy , tough guy ?
prove it , man .
name the time and place .
15 minutes . parking lot .
fist fight ?
foot race .
a what ?
yeah , you heard me-- foot race , man .
i &apos;ll run circles around you and all your pals .
oh . you girls are multiplying like bunnies .
that &apos;s weird .
lot more of you than there is of me .
we should lock all the doors .
no one gets in , no one gets out .
the culprit &apos;s inside . it &apos;s frickin &apos; gosford park !
you need to just calm down a little , jess .
i can &apos;t calm down ! i want this to be perfect .
i know , but it &apos;s too late for that , okay ?
there are kids doing their homework in there .
it &apos;s bleak .
i know after what happened with nick
you wanted this to go great ,
but it &apos;s not your fault that the dance got messed up , all right ?
you &apos;ll get &apos; em next time .
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
chug ! chug ! chug ! chug ! chug ! chug !
oh , that was a sugar rush , man . that &apos;s a buzz in the brain !
you guys see how high i just got ?
i &apos;m good .
he ain &apos;t a &apos; rone . too dumb .
aw , this is fun , man ! i miss this !
i really do , man . let &apos;s keep going .
let &apos;s get burgers . meet some girls .
different ages , man . it &apos;s so early !
hey , we got something to show you .
look , guys , we had a lot of fun , but ...
we can get in a lot of trouble for doing this .
which is why you gotta run really fast when it goes off .
like now !
oh , dude !
go ! i mean it ! go !
oh , my god !
yeah !
what are we gonna do now ?
let &apos;s ride .
oh , hell yeah !
wendy ?

well , you really did come prepared , wendy .
a wrench ...
some glue ...
a box of tampons ?
what were you gonna do with this ?
oh . sorry , sorry , sorry .
so you really didn &apos;t want the dance to happen ?
none of the boys want to dance with me .
jess ?
hey , cece .
hey .
this is wendy .
she was just telling me how she doesn &apos;t like to dance with boys .
well ... that makes sense because boys are the dumbest .
you &apos;re just saying that .
no . no , no .
no .
cece and i have met so many boys ,
and they are all so dumb .
yeah , and i &apos;ve met more than her , so ...
yeah , and cece has met more than me because she is ...
nicer than me .
nicer ?
i just mean you &apos;ve met ...
&apos;cause you &apos;re well @-@ traveled .
&quot; well @-@ traveled &quot; is how we &apos;re gonna say it ?
i mean ...
you better tread lightly .
i will ... travel ...
you travel a lot .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m ever gonna dance with a boy .
listen , are boys dumb ?
yes . yes .
do they do disappointing , stupid , stupid things
that really ... hurt your feelings ? yes .
sometimes things don &apos;t work out the way you plan them--
actually , they never work out the way you plan them--
but , in the end , it &apos;s all worth it ,
and that &apos;s why you have to try .
are you talking about sex or dancing ?
dancing .
oh , god .
dancing , dancing . dancing . dancing ..
upright dancing .
we &apos;re talking about dancing .
okay . i &apos;ll try .
so let &apos;s get back out there .
oh , cece , it &apos;s okay .
there &apos;s no light , no music .
the dance is over .
oh , no , this dance is not over .
we just need to find some stupid boys .
you look so slow .
like a s ... like a s ...
super ... dumb , slow turtle .
i &apos;m so fast , and you &apos;re so old .
so much like a ...
like a turtle , it &apos;s crazy to me .
