there &apos;s someone ali is so afraid of ...
she can &apos;t come back .
it &apos;s in everybody &apos;s best interests
that we just stay untangled from the dilaurentis family .
i &apos;m going to work for mrs.dilaurentis.
take me with you .
i can &apos;t .
is this about miranda ?
the girl i told you to look after ?
no .
radley sanitarium has to admit my mom wasn &apos;t a suicide .
toby doesn &apos;t want your help .
no , i think he does . now .
i put that envelope in your locker .
i know your mom &apos;s innocent .
we could have this place . it could be our secret .
it was ali &apos;s .
where did you find it ?
i took it from the lair in ravenswood .
why didn &apos;t you show this to us before ?
because of what &apos;s in it .
i don &apos;t understand .
i @-@ i don &apos;t recognize any of these names .
because she changed them .
she was changing stories , too .
you just have to know the real stories
in order to recognize the fake ones .
sounds like ali . the truth bored her .
so it &apos;s like creative non @-@ fiction with pseudonyms ?
i don &apos;t know what that means , but sure .
hanna , i can &apos;t believe that
you held onto this since ravenswood .
we knew that ali had journals . what &apos;s so bad about this one ?
because the stories in there , they &apos;re ...
they &apos;re personal .
personal about ali ?
about ali and us .
there are things in there that we may not know about each other ,
and things from the past that we want to forget .
so you thought you should get to read it , and we don &apos;t ?
i just didn &apos;t see the point of bringing all that up again .
we &apos;re supposed to be focused on finding ali .
that &apos;s not your call to make .
i know . i made a mistake !
and it took you till now to realize that ?
em , i said i was sorry !
did you ?
okay ! guys ...
all right . the most important thing is that we have this now .
okay , hanna , you said that there are stories in here about ali .
what about &quot; board shorts &quot;
or someone else who might have been after her ?
there might be . i don &apos;t know .
i just couldn &apos;t put all the pieces together on my own .
so this is what we do . we each take turns ,
we &apos;ll weed out the stories about us
and see what &apos;s left over .
who goes first ?
i do .
第四季 第十五集
alison ?
emily ...
you have no idea how much i &apos;ve missed you .
missed me ? i &apos;ve been here the whole time .
you &apos;re the one that &apos;s been gone .
please don &apos;t be mad .
you chose this .
you chose this for you , you chose this for us ...
i know you &apos;re upset .
i know i hurt you the most . but i want to explain .
but you can &apos;t .
but i can .
i have to . i owe that to you .
you have no idea what i &apos;ve been through .
you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .
and you have no idea what we &apos;ve been through , either .
i saved your life .
twice . i risked everything for you .
you destroyed me , okay ? !
i thought you were dead !
but i &apos;m not .
aren &apos;t you glad that i &apos;m not ?
i remember writing this .
you and me ...
at the kissing rock .
i thought i was being smart ,
locking it all up in a journal .
but they took everything , didn &apos;t they ?
who , ali ? who took everything ?
who &apos;s after you ?
i don &apos;t know .
i bet you &apos;re wondering which one &apos;s real ...
the girl in front of you or the one who wrote that .
so am i.
that &apos;s why i need you .
you always saw the best version of me ...
the person i want to be .
i don &apos;t see that anymore .
you still wear it .
my god , you &apos;re up .
thought i was going to have to drag you to school ...
by your sweat pants .
well , no sweat pants .
i see that .
so , it &apos;s your first day at your new job .
are you excited ?
relieved .
so you &apos;re okay ?
did you talk to caleb ?
yeah , we talked .
and ?
no matter what happened ,
what you had was real .
i know it was .
nothing changes that .
you know , when your dad left , it was completely--
mom . i really have to get ready for school .
i &apos;ll make us some eggs , okay ?
housekeeping !
shouldn &apos;t you be dressed ?
i thought you were meeting my dad soon .
he canceled about an hour ago .
said he &apos;s in litigation all day .
what , spencer ?
nothing , i just--
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m glad that he canceled .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s such a good idea ,
getting him involved .
you heard what your dad said .
if this happened to me ,
then this has happened to others .
radley should be shut down .
yeah , and that might be true ,
but that &apos;s not why he &apos;s helping you .
there &apos;s something that we don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a lot that we don &apos;t know .
astrophysics .
portuguese .
how to make flan .
i &apos;m being serious .
so am i.
i want to do this .
i need to .
okay .
i &apos;ll talk to my dad .
what are you doing ?
it just so happens that my morning &apos;s all freed up .
i do know how to make flan .
why am i not surprised ?
okay , let &apos;s go .
was i just the lookout ?
did i tell you to whistle if you saw something ?
no .
no , you were not the lookout .
how are things going
in the , uh , romantic lit department ?
all right , that department &apos;s been shut down .
i was just returning a pen .
really ?
yes , really .
he &apos;s very picky about his pens .
i @-@ i borrowed one last week ,
so i thought that i would return it .
what &apos;s his brand ?
hello , third degree .
it &apos;s a fisher ballpoint pen with a custom nib .
did i pass ?
the correct answer was , &quot; i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a stupid pen . &quot;
you still love him .
whether i do or i don &apos;t ,
i &apos;m just trying to figure things out with jake .
so let me help you .
you like jake . you love ezra .
i &apos;m working on it .
is it a page @-@ turner ?
yesterday i could barely make it through the first story
that was about me .
what changed ?
i want answers .
from ali , from this book-- i &apos;ll take &apos; em anywhere i can get &apos; em .
i &apos;m green , you are blue ,
you are purple , hanna &apos;s pink , ali &apos;s yellow ,
and white is for whenever we don &apos;t know who the story &apos;s about .
wow . that is so neat of you .
actually , it &apos;s so pam fields of me .
i &apos;m becoming my mother .
so , how bad is it ?
it &apos;s weird .
there &apos;s one story where she says
i &apos;m so desperately in love with her
i &apos;d rob a bank for her if she asked me to ,
and then another where she says i always put my friends first
and she wishes she was more like me .
hey . what &apos;s going on ?
emily has a system .
how much have you read ?
enough to need a break .
who &apos;s next ? purple or blue ?
spencer .
she &apos;s better with the clues .
so , you haven &apos;t told us . how &apos;s caleb ?
fine .
did you guys know that ali wrote poetry ?
when do we get to see him ?
you don &apos;t . he left already .
what do you mean he left ?
i mean he got in his car and he drove away .
to where ? to ravenswood ?
yeah , when &apos;s he coming back ?
he &apos;s not .
we broke up .
oh , my god .
are you okay ?
oh , yeah , no , i &apos;m totally fine .
i just--you know , we just needed to move on , and ...
we decided to make a clean break .
you both decided this ?
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve read this one .
hanna .
&quot; i used to go there when i was little ,
back then the bumblebee was bright ,
neon yellow little fellow , now he &apos;s lost his light . &quot;
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about ,
but rhymes okay .
yeah . yeah , it &apos;s , uh ,
it &apos;s not bad .
wait . wait . give me that .
wait . ali &apos;s describing the busy bee inn .
i used to go there like a million years ago with my family .
we &apos;d go to that aquarium in killingworth ,
and then we &apos;d have dinner at the bed and breakfast .
&quot; broke the latch and left it hanging ,
don &apos;t think the keep will mind ,
no one there to make repairs , the perfect place to hide . &quot;
it &apos;s the perfect hideaway-- an empty bed and breakfast ,
she left the door unlocked , ready for her return .
the busy bee inn has been closed for years now .
谢谢有你们相伴的五十年美好岁月
the building &apos;s still there , sign and all , but ...
we have to go there today .
i don &apos;t really think that one poem is enough to go on .
it is when it &apos;s all you &apos;ve got .
you heard spencer . she could be hiding out there .
uh , yeah , then i think we should go check it out .
i finish work at six . aria ?
yeah . no , that works for me .
em , bev &apos;s behind you .
thanks , bev .
老地方见
tara , i have to leave early .
can you cover my shift ?
thank you .
what are you working on so intently ?
uh , nothing . it &apos;s the end of a story .
it &apos;s not ready for public consumption yet .
i got your note .
uh , about tonight--
i can &apos;t now . something came up .
is everything okay ?
hanna and caleb , they broke up , so ...
emily just thought it &apos;d be a good idea
for us to get out of town for the night and ...
kind of get her mind off of things .
and i couldn &apos;t tell them that i had plans .
oh , no . no , of course not .
um , you &apos;re all going ?
yeah .
anywhere special ?
emily &apos;s making a reservation somewhere .
and i @-@ i have a stack of papers to grade , anyway .
so ... tomorrow ?
about last night ,
it didn &apos;t feel like there was anyone else .
it felt right .
i know .
this isn &apos;t fair for either of you .
or you .
you still can &apos;t see who &apos;s theratening me ?
look , i need to figure out where to go ,
i need to make a plan , some sort of escape ,
i don &apos;t know , a way to not be ...
alison dilaurentis anymore .
can you please help me ?
yeah , could you remind my dad to call toby cavanaugh
when he gets out of his meeting ?
he &apos;ll know what it &apos;s about .
that &apos;s what i said .
i don &apos;t understand .
does jason know ?
no . he doesn &apos;t need to .
actually , desi ...
i can just tell him myself .
thanks .
spencer . didn &apos;t expect you home yet .
yeah . likewise .
uh , do you have everything you need ?
yes . thank you .
and what doesn &apos;t jason know ?
ken and i are getting a divorce ,
and i &apos;d like to tell jason in person .
i go to court next week , and so your father was kind enough
to lend me some of his legal expertise .
well , i should probably get to the post office before it closes .
thanks again .
i &apos;ll uh , walk you out .
you look like you want one .
it &apos;s on me .
oh , no thanks .
one leads to a dozen .
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
low on jet fuel .
so , did you ... want something ,
or you just gonna stand there ?
uh , stand there .
yeah , i was looking for my friend who works here ,
but she must have gone home already .
can i get a medium coffee ?
thank you .
so did you hear the latest ?
about cece ?
yeah , it just broke on the news .
apparently someone saw her at a train station in maryland .
by the time the cops showed , she was gone .
but they have a trail now .
and it was definitely her ?
they have the security footage and everything .
do they know why she did it ?
apparently cece was pretty hard on cash .
then she made a few big deposits before his death .
wait , they think that someone paid her to kill wilden ?
lots of people wanted him dead .
thank you .
um , well , thanks for letting me know .
how are you ? how &apos;s your mom ?
she &apos;s good . she just started a new job today .
and the bank , well , it turns out people still read the papers .
and ... caleb ?
he &apos;s fine .
um , i should go tell my mom about cece .
yeah , yeah , of course .
well , it was good to see you .
you too .
three days ago you literally banned me from talking to her ,
and now i find you alone with her in this house
while mom is away on business !
were you with her all day ?
is that why you canceled on toby ?
no . and i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m being accused of .
do you think i like it ? !
jessica &apos;s husband is lawyering up against her .
she was upset . she needed some legal advice .
oh , what , and you &apos;re the only barrister in town ?
hey , spencer--
yes , father ?
okay ...
i canceled on toby because i heard from radley
and i didn &apos;t know how to tell him .
tell him what ?
his mother &apos;s death was an accident . no one was at fault .
what ? but i thought that you said that--
yeah , i know what i said .
that &apos;s before i had all the information .
marian was on the roof . she slipped and she fell .
but there was another patient there .
they covered up the truth to protect that patient .
apparently they &apos;re fragile .
what ?
marian &apos;s death wasn &apos;t a suicide ,
but it wasn &apos;t a murder , either .
hello again , spencer .
everything all right ?
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on between you and my dad ,
but you need to stay away from him .
spencer , honey , i think you have a very wrong impression--
there are plenty of other lawyers in this town .
find one you haven &apos;t slept with
and keep my family out of it !
you &apos;re late .
yeah , sorry .
hey , han .
gpscalculating distance to the busy bee inn ,
killingworth .
hey , did you guys hear the news ?
we got it from hanna . cece &apos;s in maryland .
haven &apos;t we found anything in the book about cece ?
not yet .
well , forget cece ,
i want to know who put her on the payroll . book , please .
thank you .
how are you doing ?
great .
i mean about caleb .
so do i.
hey , where were you ?
when ?
when i was at the brew and you weren &apos;t there .
i had to run an errand for my mom .
i get that when you get carsick .
so sorry to bother you at home .
must be important .
is hanna here ?
no , she &apos;s out with friends .
oh . well , i could come back .
mr. fitz , what &apos;s going on ?
well , i was hoping to say this to the both of you ,
but perhaps this is better .
i made a mistake .
i knew that hanna was having a hard time here at home ,
so i gave her an extension on her schoolwork .
but now we &apos;re at a place where
if she doesn &apos;t hand in some of that schoolwork ,
she might fail the class .
i had no idea .
i &apos;m happy to stay with her after school ,
and a few hours every week could really help .
but she could really stand
to have some extra encouragement at home .
maybe we could set up a schedule .
whatever i can do to help .
i &apos;m sorry , that &apos;s my new work phone , and--
oh , please , go ahead .
this might take a minute .
oh , that &apos;s okay . i can entertain myself .
dilaurentis properties .
um , sure .
which unit are you in ?
what kind of leak ?
okay , um ...
okay , can you tell where the water &apos;s coming from ?
i &apos;m looking for it right now . let &apos;s see ...
the second floor , unit b . okay .
continue to exit 48 .
okay , &quot; human cheat sheet &quot; has gotta be spencer ,
but who is &quot; suzy clueless &quot; ?
let me see .
you know you do not get to throw up on me , right ?
can you turn it down ?
i thought this was a road trip .
to find our no @-@ longer @-@ dead friend . this isn &apos;t spring break .
ali &apos;s friend &apos;s dad is having an affair ,
but the girl suzy clueless doesn &apos;t know .
okay , well , eeny @-@ meenie @-@ miney @-@ mo .
it could have been any one of us .
oh . mystery solved . it &apos;s me .
why , what does it say ?
&quot; despite her freakish pink hair dye ,
i have always admired suzy for her great sense of style . &quot;
huh . how touching .
purple me .
thanks .
em , did-- did you read this ?
&quot; the cradle robber &quot; ?
when did ali have a secret rendezvous with a younger guy ?
god , i love this song .
construction ahead .
please wait for re @-@ route .
seriously , han ?
do you think that this could be about ali ?
we &apos;ve been looking for an older guy ,
but what if she lied ? what if the guy was younger ?
in one @-@ quarter mile , turn right .
yeah , i see unit 5d ...
but no unit 5j .
oh ! i must have misheard you .
um , can you tell where the water is coming from ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna get you the name of the super .
he &apos;s in unit b.
we all set ?
okay . um ...
the smoke detector ?
all right , these complaints are really something
you should tell your super .
yes , i can get you that phone number .
when i said i could use a pit stop ,
i didn &apos;t mean in an actual pit .
i was following the gps .
i must have missed a turn .
okay , well , just get back on the highway .
we can &apos;t . there &apos;s construction .
no , not according to my phone .
are you turning around ?
no .
are you stopping ?
no .
i &apos;m not doing anything . the engine stopped working .
do you see what the problem is ?
i can barely see it .
okay , there &apos;s the radiator ,
uh , there &apos;s the dipstick ,
there &apos;s ...
let &apos;s just hypothetically say
you could figure out what &apos;s wrong with the engine .
would you even know how to fix it ?
probably not .
that &apos;s good to know .
guys , what are we gonna do ? toby thinks i &apos;m at a study group .
same with paige .
well , i texted travis .
he has a tow truck , and he doesn &apos;t know enough to ask questions .
we are about ten minutes away from a complete downpour .
it &apos;s travis .
he can get us , but it &apos;ll be two hours .
i &apos;m definitely gonna have to pee before then .
i know a place we can wait .
where ?
a cabin .
it &apos;s my uncle &apos;s . it &apos;s close by .
does it have a bathroom ?
and a fireplace .
lead the way .
okay , great . thanks .
bye .
i &apos;m sorry that took so long .
oh . no , no problem at all .
never leave home without one .
are you sure it &apos;s raindrop ?
are you sure your uncle &apos;s cabin is this way ?
i &apos;m sure .
anyone else lose cell service ?
there &apos;s a page missing ... in the story about the cradle robber ?
do you think &quot; a &quot; took it ?
maybe .
were all the pages in the book
when you took it from his apartment ?
uh , i @-@ i don &apos;t know .
you didn &apos;t notice that there was a whole page torn out ?
i &apos;ve got other stuff on my mind , spencer .
things that you don &apos;t want to talk about .
no . no , not really . i &apos;m entitled to my own privacy .
not when it affects us . or ali .
what are you saying ?
did you take the page out of this book ?
no !
and it &apos;s not gonna bring us any closer to alison ,
everyone knowing who did what behind whose back .
this it ?
yeah .
just let me go find the key .
got it .
come on .
where &apos;s the bathroom ?
there .
this place is great . you should bring jake here .
which uncle is it who owns this cabin ?
it &apos;s ... my mom &apos;s brother .
the orthodontist ? he paints ?
yeah . in his free time .
no , no , no . don &apos;t touch that . put it down .
just-- just be careful about moving anything , okay ?
okay .
anybody want tea ?
uh , sure .
so what &apos;s the plan ?
we get a tow back home and give up on the b &amp; b ?
what if ali &apos;s still hiding out there ?
that &apos;s a pretty big &quot; if . &quot;
we don &apos;t really have a lot of options right now .
we &apos;re kind of stranded .
why don &apos;t we wait and ask hanna ?
who knows what she &apos;s got up her sleeve ?
why are you being so hard on hanna ?
she &apos;s keeping something from us .
she &apos;s upset about caleb .
it &apos;s something else .
well , if she &apos;s hiding something ,
maybe it &apos;s because she knows we wouldn &apos;t understand .
okay , now i &apos;m wondering what you &apos;re keeping from us .
nobody &apos;s keeping anything from anyone , all right ?
chamomile or hibiscus ?
hanna .
it &apos;s not about ali ...
&quot; the cradle robber . &quot;
it &apos;s about me .
and mike .
mike ?
as in my little brother mike ?
oh , my god .
aria is gonna die .
will you keep your voice down ? they &apos;re all upstairs .
what would have happened if i didn &apos;t come down ?
you know what ? no , don &apos;t tell me . it &apos;s too gross .
that &apos;s aria &apos;s baby brother .
he &apos;s two years younger than us .
exactly .
look , ali ,
i &apos;m not like you .
i don &apos;t have ten guys after me at all times .
i &apos;m not skinny or perfect like the rest of you .
oh , honey .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to settle for being a cradle robber .
he was nice to me .
oh , please .
he just wanted to feel your boobs .
and you let him .
ali , please .
please just promise me that you &apos;re not gonna say anything .
okay .
i won &apos;t tell aria that you hooked up with her brother .
but that &apos;s only because she would never forgive you .
and i just don &apos;t want to see that happen to you .
look at me .
someday someone will love you for exactly who you are .
it just might take you longer than the rest of us , that &apos;s all .
hanna .
you don &apos;t have to say anything .
i know it &apos;s awful .
no . i @-@ i admit that it &apos;s weird , but ...
you didn &apos;t really think that i &apos;d stop being your friend
just because you ...
you know , did stuff with my brother ?
honestly , i &apos;m just a little shocked
that he kept his mouth shut this whole time .
well , ali made him .
trust me , he was probably more embarrassed than i was .
no , that is not true . all right ?
he used to have a huge crush on you back then .
hanna , you can &apos;t be this upset over something
that happened that long ago .
han ... what happened ?
between you and caleb .
he met someone else .
he left me .
what do you mean he met someone else ?
you know what ? i really don &apos;t want to talk about this right now .
hanna.you know we &apos;re your friends . we &apos;re here for you .
i &apos;m actually gonna go outside to see if there &apos;s any service
so i can see where the hell travis is .
han .
hanna , wait up .
could you just leave me alone , please ?
did you hear that ?
yeah . it was ... probably just some wild animal or something .
&quot; just &quot; some wild animal ?
fine . you can stay .
we should get some blankets or something for when they come back .
where does your uncle keep his linens ?
what is going on ?
nothing .
are you afraid i &apos;m gonna steal your uncle &apos;s light bulbs or something ?
no . right there .
these aren &apos;t blankets , but they &apos;ll be fine .
hanna ? !
emily !
i &apos;m still not getting any service .
okay , it &apos;s freezing out here .
can we please go back ?
we gave travis the address , he &apos;s gotta be close .
what is he doing ? did he follow us here ?
oh , my god . i don &apos;t know .
but we have to get out of here .
how ?
we can go through there .
hurry .
hanna ! emily !
help !
did you hear that ?
hanna !
emily , please help !
ohh . oh , thank god .
are you guys okay ?
what the hell happened ?
where did he go ?
we heard screams and we tried the front door
but it was locked .
yeah , we broke the window to get in here .
did you see him ?
see who ?
&quot; a &quot; !
&quot; a &quot; was here ?
yeah . how did he get out ?
i don &apos;t know .
guys , ali &apos;s book is gone .
hey .
your friends were so quiet in the car .
you too .
it &apos;s been a long night .
did you guys see a bear or something ?
you guys looked ... pretty freaked out .
yeah . yeah , something like that .
uh , there was ... a raccoon that got into the cabin
and it was kind of like a fight @-@ to @-@ the @-@ death thing .
so , what do i owe you ?
uh , for what ?
the tow .
it &apos;s not like that .
like what ?
like i &apos;m your employee .
i &apos;m your friend .
besides , i think i ruined your mom &apos;s hand towel , so ...
well , i guess we &apos;re even , then .
seriously , i gotta give you something .
you drove all that way , so ...
can &apos;t i just be a nice guy ?
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t call you back earlier .
i was in a mediation all day .
yeah , the mortali case . i just got home .
no , spencer &apos;s here .
yeah .
why don &apos;t you get some rest and i &apos;ll talk to you tomorrow ?
love you too .
mom says hi .
mediation ?
litigation ?
how do you keep it all straight ?
what exactly were you thinking talking to mrs. dilaurentis ?
i was just trying to protect this family . one of us has to .
you promised me , spencer .
i told you not to talk to that woman , and you disobeyed me .
now , you keep pushing it ,
and you will be the one to ruin this family .
understood ?
no . i don &apos;t understand .
what is going on between the two of you ?
why are you lying to mom ?
as long as you live under my roof ,
you will stay away from her . do you hear me ?
so , how &apos;s hanna doing ? is she okay ?
um , yeah , yeah , she will be .
well , it &apos;s good you got out of town .
so , how are you ?
did you get all of your work done ?
yeah , things took a little longer than i expected ,
but i ... got everything done that i needed to .
that &apos;s good .
see you tomorrow ?
yeah .
i love you .
i love you too . bye .
was that jake ?
it &apos;s no fun lying to them , is it ?
no .
did you talk to your dad about radley ?
yeah . i did .
mind if i stay here for a while ?
she came in through the window .
she wanted to apologize . to explain .
i was so mad at her , and that &apos;s why it felt so real .
