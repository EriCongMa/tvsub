第五季 第三集
just make up an excuse
and get out of jury duty , jess .
please , i need you .
no , nick .
it &apos;s a right and a privilege .
in south africa , they don &apos;t even have juries .
they have a @-@ a judge and two assessors .
god , i would have bullied you as a kid .
jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice .
would i like to be at work right now ,
participating in the spirit week assembly ?
yeah , i would .
i &apos;ve turned in some memorable performances in the past .
but it &apos;s just one day-- you &apos;ll be fine without me .
now that cece and schmidt are engaged ,
she &apos;s here all the time , and her stuff is everywhere .
okay , yes , she &apos;s a hot slob .
ever since she got boobs , people stopped making her do stuff .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , that is not an excuse .
when i first grew boobs , people started handing me stuff ,
and i got messy ,
but then you got to grow up .
not the same thing .
they &apos;re just boobs .
i promise you , tonight when i get back from jury duty ,
i will explain it to her in a way that she &apos;ll listen to ,
unlike your way , where she &apos;ll rip your dingle off
and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn .
she doesn &apos;t even live here .
she never signed our loft agreement .
she doesn &apos;t even know all the rules .
hi . look at you . you look so cute .
thank you .
love this top .
jess , nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story , okay ?
i know .
i &apos;ve heard it four times this week .
so i take a hot glass out of the dishwasher ,
i pour cold water into it ,
then the customer picks up the glass ,
and the bottom falls off .
oh , that &apos;s crazy .
for real ?
he looks down , and he goes , like ,
&quot; oh , my pants are wet . &quot;
i know , he @-@ he needs to shape that story .
i don &apos;t know how you live with him .
he is the most obnoxious ...
knock it off .
stop . stop it . knock it off .
jess , are you cool with me hanging
this groundbreaking poster
of dogs playing poker on the wall ?
jess , please tell him that he cannot hang
this horrible painting .
i really have to go .
i think it &apos;s hilarious-- they &apos;re playing poker .
rather see a painting
of arnold schwarzenegger , mid @-@ coitus .
just straight up doing it .
let &apos;s talk about the painting tonight .
uh , do nothing till i get home .
do nothing till i get home .
do nothing till i get home .
bye @-@ bye .
bye .
okay .
that &apos;s my guy .
is it me , or is cece really ...
messy .
yes .
dude .
i love it when we say things at ...
same time .
the same time .
just ...
just ... we &apos;re right there s ...
r @-@ right there s ...
wait . when we say things at the ...
same ... time .
same ... time .
okay , now you &apos;re getting in your head again .
just relax .
remember the thing about cece being really ...
messy .
and we say things at the same ...
the same ...
see , you &apos;re getting in your head because you &apos;re going quieter .
just go with your gut .
isn &apos;t cece really ... messy ?
this is fun . messy .
&apos;cause we say things at the same ... time .
time .
i &apos;m done with you .
i had it .
trying to get out of jury duty ?
excuse me ?
the way you &apos;re dressed ,
like you &apos;re in a school play about old people .
you want the judge to think you &apos;re crazy .
these are my real clothes ,
and i would never try to get out of jury duty .
it &apos;s not just a right ; it &apos;s also a privilege .
and who are you to talk about clothes ?
you &apos;re just wearing a blue suit .
oh , call milan .
notice i &apos;m not calling milan .
i &apos;m sorry .
i actually agree with you .
can we start over ?
can i buy your coffee for you ?
herbal tea , and make it a big one .
you got it .
oh , excuse me .
yeah .
oh , hey , nick .
i just met the other only person in america
who cares about jury duty , and he &apos;s a gosh @-@ damn dreamboat .
jess , we have an emergency .
cece &apos;s washing her clothes ,
and i can &apos;t even get down the hall .
she &apos;s built a laundry dam .
well , can &apos;t you just step over it ?
no time .
you know i need to go straight from the bathroom
to the kitchen . it &apos;s a blood sugar thing .
hey , jess , it &apos;s your roommate winston bishop .
isn &apos;t it amazing how a frame can
elevate already great art ?
winston , don &apos;t hang that picture till i get home .
and i would talk to schmidt about it ,
but it &apos;s like he can &apos;t even see the mess .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s love @-@ blind or something .
oh , man , i &apos;ve never been this happy in my entire life .
i got to tell you , you guys ,
cece and i just had shower sex .
don &apos;t .
did he just kiss you ?
why does he act like the pope when he &apos;s happy ?
i guess i &apos;ll just talk to cece myself ,
and i &apos;ll tell her she &apos;s a disgusting beast ,
and she &apos;ll have to listen to me &apos; cause i &apos;m the man of the house .
what ? ! no , no , no !
do not talk to cece .
also ... everything you just said was offensive . everything .
do not talk to cece .
ignore every natural instinct you have .
what &apos;s up , dude ?
hey , you mind if i steal jess for a second ?
be careful . the screen &apos;s cracked .
you might cut your face off .
yeah .
hey , jess , i &apos;m gonna give you to ... to winston .
i just have to step over the ...
i &apos;m not sure how i &apos;m gonna get over the ... here .
just ...
uh , just ... here , come on .
tell her i got over . tell her i &apos;m okay .
nick says he &apos;s fine .
hey , uh , jess ?
if one were to put a hammer through a wall ,
what would one do ?
i actually have to get going .
uh , i got to go . bye .
hello ? je ...
it was really nice to meet you .
oh , nice meeting you , too .
um , i &apos;m jess .
and you are ?
it &apos;s on the cup .
&quot; daniel . &quot;
and your phone number . that &apos;s a cool move .
yeah , it was a cool move , huh ?
you disgusting beast .
hey , nick .
did you leave your cereal out ?
you need to clean up after yourself .
shared living space , bro .
i can &apos;t do it .
schmidt , i can &apos;t do it .
you can clean up the cereal . just go put it away .
there &apos;s no cereal here ; it &apos;s in the kitchen . go clean it up .
open your eyes , open your eyes to what &apos;s happening .
you already sleep in a mud dungeon . please ...
cece &apos;s a hot slob .
cece , you &apos;re a hot slob .
what ?
i &apos;m sorry , what ?
look around , her stuff is everywhere .
it &apos;s disgusting .
hey , cece , you know what &apos;s fly ?
love that hat .
cleaning &apos;s fly .
cleaning &apos;s cool , dude .
hey , everybody , i &apos;m cece parekh .
i got a bunch of hats , but i never wear them ,
&apos;cause i &apos;m so busy throwing them around , being fly .
clean up after ... !
let &apos;s get her , winston .
am i right ?
uh , you know ...
i think we should just remember
that we all make ... mistakes , um ...
don &apos;t get soft on me right now .
so keep @-@ keep that in mind
as we go forward with our day .
i &apos;m hard to live with ?
yeah .
because i got news for you--
you are so much harder to live with .
hey , uh , guys , i @-@ i feel like we &apos;re headed
down a really unproductive path .
i made tabbouleh . who wants some ?
yes . love some .
you tell the same story over and over .
&quot; i &apos;ve got wet pants . &quot; we get it .
bottom of the glass fell clean off .
it was a science miracle .
no , the glass was hot , and the ice made the glass contract ,
and that is why it broke ; not funny the first six times ,
and not funny now , &apos; cause , guess what , nick miller--
not always funny .
no ...
he &apos;s ... so funny . you &apos;re so funny .
i &apos;m ... you don &apos;t have to hold me back . there &apos;s not a problem .
say what you got to say .
you want to say anything else , say it .
not always funny .
say it to my face .
not always funny .
say it again .
not always funny .
say it again .
not always funny .
say it again .
not always funny .
say it again .
not always funny .
say it again .
so why don &apos;t we just sit down and ...
and talk this out like adults ?
i would love to , schmidty , but where will we sit ?
okay .
oh , perhaps we &apos;ll sit
on this pile of uneaten carrots .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m living with secretariat ,
the horse !
he &apos;s hilarious .
on the plus side , i &apos;m being
very witty during this fight !
you know what , nick ?
number 24 .
number 16 .
yes ! sorry .
i never win anything .
sorry . uh , uh ... oh .
dr. foster , is everything okay ?
j.d. ?
it ain &apos;t .
i decided i was gonna be
marcus the meerkat , because , you know ,
you and i have remarkably similar body shapes .
okay .
um , what &apos;s the problem ?
i fell and shattered my hip .
oh , god ! i &apos;m so sorry .
how bad is it ?
the , uh , paramedic described my left leg
as a skin bag full of
hip shards ?
a skin ... a skin bag full of hip shards .
you &apos;re gonna have to take over my duties .
we are talking about the big job :
acting principal .
yes ! i &apos;d love to !
oh ... but my number just got called .
well , that means
the district &apos;s gonna be
bringing in becky cavatappi .
ugh !
they &apos;ve been pushing her for my job .
she has fake zoomers .
what kind of message does that send
to girls with growing zoomers ?
i think she had her butt done , too .
every time she runs ,
that thing sounds like an indian rain stick .
i really want to be principal , so , um ...
i &apos;ll be there .
uh , i &apos;ll just have to , uh ...
get out of jury duty .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon !
sorry . it &apos;s a tense situation .
so who should i call next to tell my story ?
i &apos;m not cleaning till you get off the phone ,
nicole .
how about patty &apos;s pizza ?
smooth it out , smooth it out .
oh , boy .
you are angry .
winston , i need your help ...
getting out of jury duty
jessica damn day !
i know , i &apos;m a terrible person . put nick on the phone .
no can do , j.
he and cece are in it .
what ? i told him not to talk to her .
how bad is it ? is nick standing really wide @-@ legged ?
is cece calling him
mean girl names ?
don &apos;t call me nicole !
okay , nick @-@ hole !
yeah . that &apos;s happening .
kids , huh ?
yeah .
is that jess ? jess .
it &apos;s awful .
i don &apos;t know what to do . i &apos;m sure cece has her flaws ,
but i just can &apos;t see them .
and even if i could , what would i do ?
how does a man stand up to the sunset ?
cece and nick are basically the same person .
both stubborn , hotheaded
and brutally honest .
oh , dear lord .
i &apos;m marrying nick .
aw . i kind of love that .
all right , what should we do ?
can &apos;t go to cece &apos;s apartment .
nadia &apos;s baby is teething .
have you ever heard a russian child scream ?
all the time , in my putin nightmare .
look , get cece to sign the loft agreement .
nick wrote it , so he &apos;ll like that .
they &apos;ll both play hardball till they get bored ,
which will be immediately .
that &apos;s good .
you &apos;ve impressed me today .
oh , wait , wait . is that jess ?
hey , hey . give me the phone . all right .
hey , jess , nick @-@ hole here ...
what ?
stop calling me nicole ! i &apos;m a boy !
nick is calling everyone he knows
to tell them this dumb story .
hello , your friend is a pig person .
guys , stop .
hey , chaz , i &apos;m on the other line .
you &apos;re not gonna believe what happens to this glass .
it &apos;s an incredible story ; you &apos;re gonna freak out .
please stop .
i &apos;ll talk to you soon .
put me on speaker .
hold on .
button &apos;s right there .
i know which button it is .
now , what i &apos;m about to say
might shock you ,
but i need help getting out of jury duty .
look , i have the chance to be acting principal .
you don &apos;t know becky cavatappi , but she &apos;s a murderer .
what ?
she @-@ she &apos;s not a murderer ,
but i ... i really don &apos;t like her .
you can &apos;t just be going around throwing &quot; murderer &quot; on people .
guys , i need to go in right now . what do i do ?
whatever the trial &apos;s about , i say i don &apos;t believe in it .
just tell them that your parents are pakistani militants .
that &apos;s what i do ; works every time . yeah .
why &apos;d you have an accent when you said &quot; pakistani &quot; ?
because that &apos;s actually how you pronounce it .
&quot; pakazani &quot; ?
it &apos;s great seeing you guys work together .
you said it stupid .
i don &apos;t really want to lie .
it &apos;s kind of not really my brand .
you &apos;ll never see any of these people again .
there are no consequences .
okay . uh , i gotta go .
just remember you &apos;re a garbage person
and you hate america .
i &apos;m a garbage person who hates america .
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth ,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth , so help me god ?
the whole truth and nothing but the truth ,
so help me gob .
did ... did you just say &quot; gob &quot; ?
did you say &quot; gob &quot; ?
what ?
yeah , she said &quot; gob . &quot;
whose side are you on ?
justice .
this question is for potential juror number 16 .
this case involves marriage .
i don &apos;t believe in marriage .
excuse me , you don &apos;t believe in marriage ?
as a concept ?
well , you know , you gotta keep the freeway open .
uh , &apos; cause ...
sooner or later , you &apos;re gonna get tired
of the same cars driving down it .
capiche ?
yes , capiche .
the two things that are ruining this country
are marriage and democracy .
how refreshing .
another person who wants to get out of jury duty .
i thought some people took this seriously ,
but apparently not .
trial by jury
is a pillar of our democracy ,
and yes , it is inconvenient .
but sometimes , sacrifice
and civic duty are .
you don &apos;t deserve the honor of serving your country .
maybe you should live in south africa ,
where they don &apos;t have juries .
i know , i know !
they have a judge and two assessors .
look , i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
i didn &apos;t mean all that other stuff .
i &apos;d be a great juror .
if you put me on this jury ,
you will not regret it .
that was an emotional moment ,
and i feel it would be best punctuated with a ...
crash of that thing .
nah .
the roommate loft agreement
was formed in the year of our lord 2005 .
hurricane katrina
had just decimated the american south ,
but we here , in loft 4d ,
had gone through , well , perhaps in many ways
a more horrifying katrina .
you can &apos;t say that .
can &apos;t say that .
a kitchen condom disposal clause ?
that is not a relevant clause .
not relevant ? i almost died .
winston !
yeah ?
stop having sex in the sink !
okay .
first clause : &quot; if a roommate has
&quot; five or more grooming products in the bathroom ,
&quot; they must use a shower caddy
&quot; or pay an additional ten dollars in rent ,
adjusted every two years for inflation . &quot;
i currently pay an additional $ 11.97 in rent .
okay , yeah , well , i &apos;m not using a shower caddy ,
because i &apos;m an adult woman and i don &apos;t live in a dorm .
have you been to a dorm recently ?
it &apos;s like a spa .
those horny texters live like kings .
nick is really damaging this negotiation .
hey , speaking of damages ,
you know , what if we all pitched in
to fix loft damages ?
i don &apos;t know , let &apos;s say ...
nick broke something , like a wall .
i &apos;ll fix it . i can fix anything .
yeah , not according to
the &quot; nick can &apos;t do electrical work &quot; clause .
no , no , don &apos;t touch him ! he &apos;s electric , he &apos;s electric !
hot !
cece , you &apos;re the love of my life ,
but i @-@ i kindly ask that you don &apos;t read ahead .
okay , fine .
i &apos;ll use a shower caddy , okay ?
and now that i &apos;ve agreed to my thing ,
can we just agree that nick can limit his stories ?
you trying to take away
my constitutional right to be hilarious ?
fine . i won &apos;t use a shower caddy .
use the caddy , i &apos;ll be less chatty .
it &apos;s hilarious .
it &apos;s undeniably hilarious that i just said that .
do you hear yourself ?
great , we &apos;re in agreement .
now just sign here , and we &apos;ll give you a key .
give her a key ?
i &apos;m a little confused .
is that really necessary ?
it &apos;s like giving a squirrel a key to the park .
the park is always open ,
and the squirrel is there with rabbit ,
and squirrel and rabbit are there all the time .
so does squirrel need key ?
what is happening ? you &apos;re dropping all your articles .
i not !
now you &apos;re losing verbs !
so , are the squirrel and the rabbit-- they &apos;re friends ?
hey , babe , do not get concerned .
he &apos;s probably just tired or hungry ,
or getting jealous that i &apos;m spending
so much time with his best friend .
as a matter of fact , i am tired , and i am hungry ,
but the third thing is way off base .
if you weren &apos;t a girl ,
i &apos;d karate chop you in the mouth .
you would get winded
just trying to ball your fist up , dough @-@ boy .
well , good thing you don &apos;t need a fist for a karate chop ,
you stupid idiot .
you are such a door knob .
and if i wanted to karate chop you , you &apos;d be dead !
look at her flinch .
this is good . so scared .
shakey @-@ shakey .
i literally have not moved .
i &apos;m so not worried about you .
you want to go take a nap now ?
stop ! i can &apos;t listen to the two people
i love most in this world fight like this .
sorry , winston .
huh ? what &apos;d he say ?
oh , no .
schmidt , what did you do ?
so , you are all
serving on this jury .
this is a capital case
and will last upwards of a month ,
and due to media exposure ,
you will have to be sequestered .
so go home , pack a bag ,
do not e @-@ mail me .
the answer is yes .
your hotel does have a pool ,
but is otherwise aggressively mediocre .
there , i banged the thing .
yep .
okay .
i need a stapler .
you stay .
so here we are .
all right , nick , i &apos;ll sign it .
i don &apos;t want to hurt schmidt ,
and right now , he &apos;s probably just
crying his eyes out at the ...
denim bar .
i really appreciate you keeping
the store open for me late , maurice .
that denim bar is like his temple .
he legitimately wants us to get married there .
at a denim bar ?
yeah .
look , schmidt and i are not gonna work
if you and i can &apos;t get along .
because ...
you &apos;re schmidt &apos;s family .
in a way ,
it &apos;s like we &apos;re engaged .
you &apos;re not my type .
i like them crazier and ...
and sexually very prude .
you just don &apos;t fit the bill .
look , you don &apos;t have to sign this thing .
it &apos;s stupid .
the last page is just
obscene drawings of cartoon princesses .
i saw them ; you &apos;re very talented .
thanks . what they &apos;re doing is disgusting ,
but i think the drawings are nice .
yeah .
look , if i &apos;m being honest ,
yeah , i feel a little jealous .
you know , schmidt and i used to hang out
all the time , and now we don &apos;t ,
and it &apos;s weird .
i mean , to be honest , i think i was a little ...
jealous , too .
of me ?
in a way ,
you &apos;re always gonna know him a little bit better than me .
except physically .
you &apos;d be surprised .
schmidt , relax .
we &apos;re good .
yeah .
we talked , and everything &apos;s okay .
yeah .
thank god .
hey , easy , all right . okay .
okay , there he is .
everybody &apos;s ...
whoa , mother , i &apos;m right here .
are you hugging them
while they &apos;re making out ?
yes , uh , that is weird .
thank you for saying that . please let go of me .
i &apos;m not interested in this . let go of me .
did that wall fall down ?
just please don &apos;t leave again .
yeah , about that .
well ... this is it .
since you won &apos;t be able
to contact me for a month ,
i &apos;ve left a complementary bowl of advice .
for instance , um ,
&quot; nick , stop doing that . &quot;
just applies to everything .
that &apos;s what &apos;s up . that &apos;s what &apos;s up .
e &apos;r&apos;day , e &apos;r&apos;day .
nick , stop doing that .
that &apos;s what &apos;s up .
it &apos;s gonna be a long month . i &apos;m gonna pace myself .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
don &apos;t worry .
i &apos;m gonna keep them in line for you .
no , you can &apos;t hit them .
even if it &apos;s for their benefit ?
yeah . okay .
i got you a little something .
it &apos;s just to trade with .
it &apos;s currency in there . i don &apos;t know .
oh , that &apos;s so sweet , nick .
um , but you know i &apos;m not going to prison , right ?
as long as you &apos;re free right here , you &apos;re never in prison .
i bought you this burner
from an unmarked storefront in koreatown .
i believe it &apos;s small enough
to conceal in the waistband of your underpants .
oh , thank you , but ...
it &apos;s four walls . they can &apos;t hold you , though .
make friends with big ladies .
keep your head up .
okay .
make sure to put , uh , toilet tissue down on the toilet seat .
never sleep .
thanks .
make your toothbrush into a shiv . everything &apos;s a weapon .
see , hate put you in there , but love gonna bust you out .
don &apos;t be afraid to put two layers of toilet tissue down .
let &apos;s do it .
let &apos;s get into this and see what sage wisdom
jess has for us .
&quot; no biting . &quot;
that &apos;s a reminder for me .
ew , &quot; no more poop pranks &quot; ?
oh , yeah , those get out of hand quickly .
that was a disgusting february .
&quot; if the shish kebob falls before i come back , nick wins .
if it falls after , schmidt wins &quot; ?
is that ... oh .
check it out , shish kebob .
check it out , yeah .
that &apos;s super gross .
&quot; schmidt &apos;s allowed to request that you do his back
with sunscreen once a week . &quot;
actually , can someone do that now ?
it &apos;s nighttime .
&quot; boys &apos; shorts should at most rise
six inches above the knee . &quot;
yeah , but where does the knee begin ?
right ... here .
you know , she never specifies where the knee should begin .
that &apos;s your knee , okay ?
this is the knee ?
yes . yes .
&quot; stop harassing beck . &quot; absolutely not .
he cut you off on the freeway .
that &apos;s for you ?
yeah .
yeah , makes sense .
&quot; tell schmidt not to sing &apos; rent &apos; in the shower .
we &apos;re in a drought . &quot;
five thousand , 2,500 , 600 minutes
those aren &apos;t the words .
&quot; stop reading this
within the first three hours of my absence . &quot;
whoa . holy mackerel .
how did she know ?
&quot; because i know everything . &quot;
that &apos;s super scary , right ?
is she still here ?
i &apos;m just messing with you .
it says &quot; smile more . &quot;
that &apos;s ...
yes !
dame it !
you are my slave for 17 days .
