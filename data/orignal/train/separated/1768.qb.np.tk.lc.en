well , there was this girl .
what did you do ?
nothing .
really , it was just kissing .
all right .
so , we &apos;re still getting married ?
yes .
because we love each other .
yes .
and it &apos;s the happiest day of our life .
don &apos;t push it .
i need some time to take a step back
and reevaluate our situation .
bye , sheldon .
well , gollum ...
... you &apos;re an expert on rings .
what do i do with this one ?
so , what package are you thinking ?
mm , this one comes with music and flowers .
oh , they even stream the whole thing live on the internet .
why would we want that ?
&apos;cause there &apos;s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there
who don &apos;t believe they can land a short , nearsighted scientist .
let &apos;s give them hope .
whatever . put us on the internet .
i &apos;ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section .
i @-@ if you &apos;re not into this , we can do it another time .
no . no , i want to .
look , we &apos;ve put this off long enough .
let &apos;s do it .
that &apos;s exactly what you said the first time we slept together .
oh , excuse me .
sheldon .
leonard , have you gotten married yet ?
no . why ?
good . don &apos;t do it !
why not ?
some important new information has come to light .
women are the worst .
i thought it was paper cuts , but i was wrong .
no piece of paper ever cut me this deep .
what happened now ?
amy has ended our relationship .
oh , no . seriously ?
what &apos;s going on ?
amy broke up with sheldon .
she did ?
is penny crying ?
no .
no , of course not .
they thrive on our suffering .
buddy , i @-@ i &apos;m so sorry .
is there anything i can do ?
yes . if i ever talk about going out with a girl again ,
roll your eyes at me
like i do to you when you say dumb things .
sheldon , uh , o @-@ okay ,
just because you &apos;re going through this with amy
doesn &apos;t mean that all women are bad .
whatever .
hey , i just heard about you and sheldon . are you okay ?
not really .
can you come over ?
uh , actually i &apos;m in vegas .
leonard and i are about to get married .
hold on .
you &apos;re getting married and you didn &apos;t invite me ?
well , it was kind of a spur @-@ of @-@ the @-@ moment thing .
hope i can catch the bouquet from here .
amy , don &apos;t be like that .
why did i just hear amy &apos;s name ?
penny &apos;s on the phone with her .
did she say anything about me ?
never mind . i don &apos;t care .
well , if you care , you can find out and tell me .
just don &apos;t be shocked when you find out that i don &apos;t care .
okay , will you relax ?
you &apos;re not missing anything special .
hey .
she &apos;s upset .
look , it &apos;s gonna be a great wedding .
look at you in your little suit .
amy &apos;s upset ? is it about me ?
no , i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re eloping .
your marriage is causing her pain ?
yeah , great , i take it back .
go ahead and do it . yay for love !
hello .
what are you doing here ?
when last we spoke , you said you needed time .
well , it &apos;s only been 11 hours .
the lord of the rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours .
i made you watch that , you said it was an eternity .
sheldon , when i &apos;m ready to talk , i &apos;ll let you know .
very well .
you seem to be headed somewhere .
may i walk with you ?
sure .
boy , i &apos;m glad we &apos;re going out again .
we &apos;re not back together .
why ?
is there someone else ?
just couldn &apos;t wait for that first notch
on your bedpost , could you ?
if you must know ,
i &apos;m going to howard and bernadette &apos;s
to watch the wedding .
and who &apos;s this guy you &apos;re taking ?
there &apos;s no guy !
oh , you &apos;re going to a wedding alone ?
that &apos;s sad .
i &apos;m not gonna be alone .
i &apos;ll be with my friends .
your friends ?
well , i think you mean my friends .
and why wasn &apos;t i invited to this ?
maybe because the two of us being there
would make them feel awkward .
we make everyone feel awkward .
that &apos;s our thing !
they &apos;re running a little behind .
should be pretty soon .
okay .
hey , if you &apos;re hungry , there &apos;s a breakfast buffet
at the strip club next door .
thanks , but i don &apos;t like glitter on my scrambled eggs .
i don &apos;t think the strippers prepare the meal , but okay .
look , it @-@ it &apos;s not how i pictured it either ,
but i &apos;m still glad we &apos;re doing it .
me , too .
you sure ?
yes .
and you promise you &apos;re okay with everything from the car ?
oh , my god , would you stop bringing it up ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry .
we have the rest of our lives
to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it .
so what do you think ?
should we run next door and grab a bite ?
what if they call our names ?
oh , don &apos;t worry . they gave me this vibrating coaster .
oh , and the fairy tale continues .
thank you for doing this .
our pleasure .
you feeling okay ?
we were together for so long ,
i honestly don &apos;t know what i &apos;m feeling .
well , that &apos;s understandable .
you forgot . it &apos;s called &quot; happy . &quot;
howard .
i &apos;m not saying anything bad .
just that she was in love with her captor
and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon .
i know what you &apos;re going through .
my @-@ my last breakup was pretty tough .
oh . what was her name ?
hey , it &apos;s a true story .
i don &apos;t need the third degree .
for god &apos;s sake , sheldon , what are you doing ?
i didn &apos;t want to come in .
i was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable .
so i &apos;ll just stay out here
and pretend that i don &apos;t have to go to the bathroom .
howard , do something .
i &apos;m on it .
sheldon , you being here might not be making things better .
i see .
and is that why everybody was invited but me ?
they didn &apos;t invite everybody but you .
bernadette invited me ,
and stuart lives here .
who wants hot cinnamon rolls ?
so , when you hear the music , that &apos;s your cue .
any questions ?
oh , the package that we paid for
said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals .
where are the rose petals ? !
we &apos;re out !
you know what ? it &apos;s fine .
we can use the potpourri from the bathroom !
really , we &apos;re good .
yup , just want to get married .
yeah .
great .
i &apos;ll see you two up there .
this is it .
i know .
i love you .
i love you , too .
was that a yes or no on the potpourri ? !
no , thank you !
we &apos;re good !
raj , you &apos;re probably wondering
why amy and i aren &apos;t showing any affection to one another .
didn &apos;t even crack the top ten .
well , you should know that she recently broke up with me .
i said i needed time to think .
i &apos;m sure you guys will figure something out .
you hear that ? raj is devastated .
sheldon , shh . the wedding &apos;s starting .
i see what &apos;s happening .
sides are forming .
well , if bernadette &apos;s on amy &apos;s team , i pick howard .
i &apos;m not taking sides .
fine , i guess i &apos;m stuck with raj .
really ?
at least you got picked .
before i go any further ,
have either of you prepared your own vows ?
yes .
no .
you wrote vows ?
yeah .
well , i don &apos;t have any .
you &apos;re kind of making me look bad .
it &apos;s okay . i @-@ i don &apos;t have to say them .
no , no , no , go ahead .
i &apos;ll come up with something mushy , you &apos;ll cry ,
we got this .
&quot; penny , we are made of particles
that have existed since the moment the universe began .
i like to think those atoms traveled
14 billion years through time and space to create us ,
so that we could be together and make each other whole . &quot;
penny ?
right . um ... okay .
leonard , i mean , you &apos;re not only the love of my life .
i mean , you &apos;re my best friend , and ...
... you &apos;ve got a friend in me .
you got troubles .
i got &apos; em , too .
there isn &apos;t anything i wouldn &apos;t do for you .
we stick together , and we can see it through ,
&apos;cause ... you &apos;ve got a friend in me .
is that the song from toy story ?
he loves that movie .
i do .
aw , that was beautiful .
yeah .
i mean , not like our wedding beautiful .
no , we totally won .
amy , i don &apos;t understand , are we broken up or not ?
it &apos;s like you can &apos;t make up your mind .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re not giving me any space to think .
well , you should think fast ,
because men can sire offspring their entire lives ,
but those eggs you &apos;re toting around have a sell @-@ by date .
you know what , sheldon , you &apos;ve made this really easy .
you &apos;re immature , you &apos;re selfish ,
you just insulted me to my face .
i don &apos;t need any more time to think . we &apos;re broken up .
amy ...
will someone take me home ?
yeah . come on , i &apos;ll give you a ride .
... symbolizes your eternal love .
i now pronounce you husband and wife .
we did it !
i &apos;m so glad you guys could watch !
we &apos;ll say it was beautiful in the comment section .
no , no , no . hang on .
i believe i &apos;m supposed to carry you across the threshold .
can you ?
who do you think carries sheldon to bed
when he falls asleep in front of the tv ?
okay , let &apos;s do it .
you gonna make it ?
i &apos;m okay !
nicely done !
thank you .
finally , there &apos;s a mrs. hofstadter
who isn &apos;t disappointed in me .
well , the night is still young .
everything all right ?
yeah . i guess .
just tell me .
it &apos;s just , when we were kissing ,
i couldn &apos;t help but picture you with that other girl .
oh , no .
no , come on .
i have a friend in you .
you said so .
you &apos;re right . just forget it .
yeah .
okay , listen . uh ...
if you &apos;re imagining that it was sexy ,
it wasn &apos;t .
we @-@ we were both drunk , and she smelled like an ashtray .
the boat was moving a lot , so i chipped her tooth .
did you feel guilty ?
no , she had dental insurance .
did you feel guilty after kissing her ?
yes . i felt guilty as soon as it happened .
i feel guilty every time i see her .
what do you mean , every time you see her ?
what ... do i mean ?
boy , that &apos;s a toughie .
you still see her ?
well , no , not socially .
but , you know , just at work .
you work with her ? !
how could you not tell me that ? !
i wanted to tell you in the car , but you told me to stop talking !
oh , okay . so you &apos;re saying this is my fault ?
no , of course not .
okay , l @-@ look ,
instead of fighting ,
why don &apos;t we dim the lights ,
um , get naked and make a baby ?
i was trying to lighten the mood .
it &apos;s not easy . you try it .
hello , mother .
shelly ! how &apos;s my baby doing ?
i just wanted to let you know
that you can remove amy from your nightly prayers .
unless you &apos;re open to praying for
a beehive to fall on her head .
oh , what &apos;s going on ?
she broke up with me .
oh , shelly .
no , i &apos;ll be okay .
but i think that i &apos;d like
to send the ring back to you .
well , let &apos;s not be hasty .
are you sure it &apos;s over for good ?
it &apos;s over for me . i &apos;m done with women .
like when i swore off pop rocks .
they both hurt you on purpose .
you want to tell me what happened ?
are you going to say it &apos;s all part of god &apos;s plan ?
good chance .
then no , thank you .
well , honey , don &apos;t send it back yet .
your sister &apos;s married , and i &apos;m not letting your brother
give my grandmother &apos;s ring to that whore he &apos;s dating .
wasn &apos;t mary magdalene a woman of ill repute ?
when your idiot brother redeems mankind ,
he can date whoever he wants .
i know it hurts now , but it &apos;s gonna get better .
yeah .
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
you &apos;ve got so much to offer .
thank you .
any man would be lucky to have you .
that &apos;s true .
i just hope i did the right thing .
i &apos;m sure you did .
maybe that &apos;s the problem-- you always do the right thing .
maybe it &apos;s time to do the wrong thing .
like you &apos;re doing right now ?
exactly .
i asked you over and over if you were okay .
why would you go through with the wedding if you weren &apos;t ?
i thought i was okay , but it turns out i &apos;m not .
okay , listen , i may not have been entirely faithful ,
but you , you are not easy to lift !
well , marriage must agree with you .
well , you are just glowing .
i &apos;m not glowing .
i &apos;m upset .
well , whatever it is , it agrees with you .
knock , knock , knock , penny ?
knock , knock , knock , penny ?
knock , knock , knock , penny ?
what &apos;s this ?
leonard told me what happened ,
so i took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage .
oh . that &apos;s so sweet of you .
yeah . i know .
turns out , being sweet
isn &apos;t enough to keep a girl these days .
i blame madonna .
i &apos;m sorry to hear about you and amy .
well , i &apos;m sorry about leonard .
thought i raised him better than that .
you know , it &apos;s bad enough what happened ,
but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her
all the time at the university .
he does ? who is it ?
some girl named mandy .
mandy chao ?
yeah .
oh , you don &apos;t need to worry about her .
she &apos;s brilliant and attractive .
she can do way better than leonard .
that &apos;s great .
wait a minute .
i know this may sound farfetched ,
but i &apos;m on the market now .
you know , if i dated mandy ,
that would teach both leonard and amy a lesson .
that &apos;s ridiculous .
oh , you &apos;re right .
i could never be with a woman whose self @-@ esteem was so low
she &apos;d be with leonard .
i &apos;m with leonard .
yeah , i know . forever .
who would have believed these things would happen to us ?
right ?
i can &apos;t believe amy actually went through with it .
hang on .
you knew that she was going to end it with me ?
did you try and stop her ?
i told her to be true to herself
and do what makes her happy .
do what makes her happy ?
she plays the harp and her car is paid for .
how much happier can she be ?
okay , look , it &apos;s not my fault
that she thought you were a bad boyfriend .
i see .
i think i &apos;ll be going .
sheldon ...
no , no , no , no .
we are done here .
would you mind opening the door
and then angrily slamming it behind me ?
sure .
thank you .
and slam it hard ,
because i am pretty steamed .
all right , leonard , hang in there .
talk to you tomorrow .
what happened ? they just got married .
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s a mess .
they had a huge fight in vegas .
think they &apos;ll break up ?
i don &apos;t know . sounds pretty bad .
penny &apos;s back in her apartment all by herself .
really ?
would you like to hear another reason
why men are better than women ?
sure , let &apos;s make it an even hundred .
you would never kiss me and make me say &quot; i love you &quot;
and then break up with me .
i wouldn &apos;t .
and you know why ?
&apos;cause you &apos;re a man .
the champagne of genders .
well , i may be a man ,
but i think i &apos;m the one that screwed up on this one .
yeah , well , and you admit it , like a man .
all you hear women say is ,
&quot; i &apos;ll just have a salad . &quot;
&quot; where &apos;s my lip gloss ? &quot;
&quot; i think this element should be called radium . &quot;
that last one was madame curie .
i figured that out .
you know what ? she was kind of an honorary man .
she had a penis made of science .
can &apos;t believe i &apos;m spending my wedding night with you .
really ?
i never imagined it any other way .
