Alicia Florrick and Will Gardner, please.
12 counts of murder.
12? 12 murders?
Yes.
I...
What did your client do, shoot up the base?
Sergeant Elkins works in the UAS division.
UAS?
Unmanned Aerial Systems.
Drones.
Sergeant Elkins is charged with disobeying orders
and firing two Hellfire missiles on 12 unarmed citizens
in Waziristan, Afghanistan.
And you're defending him?
Her. Yes.
So, why do you need us?
We're still not very qualified to assist in military court.
You did it once before.
Yes, but not very well.
Well, that is debatable.
Due to the seriousness of the charge,
Sergeant Elkins is insisting on civilian support,
and I thought you would do the least damage.
Sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.
I am so sorry, Captain, we would love to help.
She has money from her family.
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.
Yeah? What are you finding out?
You're being investigated.
Thanks, Kalinda.
Anything else?
State's attorney's office wants to use you
to get to Lemond Bishop.
I know. If we drop him as a client,
will they back off?
Look, don't...
Kalinda, come on.
Don't worry, they're backing off anyway.
Peter's no longer in charge of the investigation.
He... what?
Yeah, he's worried about conflict of interest.
His wife working under you.
He really backed out?
Yeah.
I hear someone confronted him about this conflict of interest.
So, who is in charge?
My guess is Cary.
So that's your source on this? Cary?
No, someone close to him.
Someone else on the investigation.
So, you think I can exhale?
I think you dodged a bullet.
Miss Sharma?
Hello.
Who was that?
No idea.
Where are you again?
D.C.
Oh, yes. Cheese, our most important client.
Tell Eli not to screw this one up.
We lose cheese, we lose our quarter.
Will do.
Now, go exhale, do something nice for someone.
You know, Captain,
we might be able to work something out.
We thank the USDA for their time
as they reconsider which food guide to recommend to Congress.
Our argument is simple.
Go back to the pyramid.
The old food guide was simple, bold, understandable.
We have witnesses here today, schoolteachers, parents,
who will testify that children could easily grasp its pictures.
That's the schoolteacher?
Yeah.
She looks like a Bond girl.
She's a fifth grade schoolteacher.
I don't care, she doesn't look like a schoolteacher.
They won't listen unless she looks like one.
Tell her to put a sweater on or something.
What? Hold on, hold on.
The new design...
Give me your glasses.
Give me your glasses.
Um, the-the new design,
MyPlate, is confusing.
Give her this.
Go on.
What are grains?
What is protein?
We would argue that this is the result of aggressive lobbying
by the produce council
As opposed to aggressive lobbying by the cheese council.
We don't deny that we are lobbying, Undersecretary Brattle,
but we would deny that that's all that we're doing.
Um, as you can hear from a Miss Vickie Evans,
a schoolteacher from Nebraska...
Uh, she can talk
of the difficulties that she has with MyPl...
Why don't we just say what this is really about?
Cheese. You've lost $2 billion a year
because of the new, more accurate guide.
Are you kidding?
More accurate?
You have dairy in a cup!
How is that accurate?
It's not a cup,
it's a smaller circle.
You drink milk in a cup,
you don't drink cheese...
There was no room
on the plate.
What are you talking about?
It's a cartoon, it's not a real plate.
Who's paying you off? The produce council?
Okay, thank you, everyone.
We will discuss this in executive session,
make our recommendations to Congress.
What's going on with your boss?
Don't worry, Secretary Henshaw's still with you.
He has to affect neutrality.
He didn't expect the brush-back from the undersecretary, that's all.
Is he trying to shake us down?
Oh, yes, Chicago.
I forgot.
The secretary doesn't "shake down."
He's on your side.
This is going to Congress next week.
The pyramid will be reinstated.
Trust me.
That's the secretary's aide?
Yeah, why?
Well, how does she know me?
She doesn't know you.
Well, I'm not that popular...
Oh, good, I was just making sure our gift arrived.
Sergeant Elkins receiving counsel.
Ten-hut!
At ease, sergeant.
Yes, sir.
These are the two civilian lawyers I discussed.
Will Gardner, Alicia Florrick,
from Lockhart&Gardner.
Hello, Gina. Do you want to sit?
No, sir, thank you.
Okay.
If you don't mind, we will.
So, these...
murder counts,
they are all based on your work
at the Predator UAS installation
in...
Nevada.
Addis Air Force Base, sir.
And you do what there?
I am a UAV operator.
I read and react to real-time
on-the-ground alterations as detected by the UAV sensors
and control the Predator targeting systems.
The missiles?
Yes, ma'am.
Your commanding officer accuses you of inaccurate
and unprofessional reporting as to the presence
of 12 unarmed civilians, resulting in their deaths.
Yes, sir, that is accurate.
It's accurate that that happened?
Uh, no, sir, it-it's accurate as to the charge.
I see.
So... what happened?
I wish you would sit down.
I'd rather not, sir.
There are occasional delays in the transmission of text alerts
and sensor relays; I received the information too late, sir.
The transmission is logged as on time,
because it indicates the time it was sent
but not the time it arrived.
Is there someone who can corroborate that, Gina?
Ma'am, I-I don't understand the question.
Is there someone who saw the delay in the transmission?
Yes, ma'am. As I already informed
Captain Hicks, my pilot saw it, too.
Lieutenant Ventura.
The pilot in the drone?
No, ma'am, on the ground.
We remotely operate the Predator UAV from Nevada.
Well, maybe we can interview him.
Unfortunately, military justice moves very swiftly.
So we're struggling to catch up.
Uh, are you...?
Go ahead, Sergeant, ask the question.
Are-are you taking my case, sir?
Do you want us to take your case?
I do.
Then yes.
She looks like she's 15 years old.
She's terrified.
One thing I don't understand,
is why are they prosecuting this?
I mean, there must be hundreds of civilian deaths
in similar drone mishaps.
Why prosecute this one?
I have no answer for that.
Okay, let's get to this pilot, Lieutenant Ventura.
Get me the dairy people on the phone, all of them.
Where did you go?
I need your help with the produce people.
Heard they got a new lobbyist, and I heard he's as good as me.
She is.
Who?
Secretary's aide, Stacie Hall.
She flipped sides.
No conference call, I'll call them later!
Are you sure?
Yep, she played you, Eli.
She left the USDA to become a lobbyist for the produce people.
Produce or fruit?
Fruit.
USDA never intended to go back to the pyramid.
They were just trying to shake down the Dairy Guild.
Oh, I'll be back.
Having a hard time staying away from me?
Yep, you are just irresistible, Kalinda.
So, what's up?
I need a meeting with Diane Lockhart.
Really? Why?
Our investigation into Will Gardner.
I thought you guys were winding down.
We are. Just... dotting a few I's.
All right. I'll see what I can do,
and you'll tell me when the investigation heats up again.
Oh, you will be my first call.
You want me out of your chair?
No, stay comfortable.
Who was that?
Kalinda.
Really?
Yes.
How nice for you two.
Oh, yes. She is quite the conversationalist.
She's definitely that.
We're gonna stay in touch.
Got her on speed-dial, have you?
Oh, thanks for reminding me.
Kalinda is arranging a meeting with Diane Lockhart,
and she asked me to call her
when the investigation heats up.
Then give her a call.
Getting a special prosecutor today.
You're kidding, who?
Me.
I'm Wendy Scott-Carr.
Hello.
Hi.
Peter assigned you?
Yes.
I think he thought that the person who ran against him--
and lost-- was a safe bet to be objective
with a case involving his wife.
Of course, this case doesn't involve his wife.
Actually, we don't know that yet.
Let's see where the evidence takes us.
Shall we get to work?
This court-martial is hereby convened under Article 18
of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Colonel Leora Kuhn, military judge presiding. All rise!
Are there any other judges in the military?
Sit. Except you.
Mr. Gardner, isn't it?
Yes, Your Honor.
What were you saying?
What was I saying?
Yes. As I entered court, you saw fit
to say something to your cocounsel.
Mrs. Florrick.
Judge Kuhn.
What were you saying, Mr. Gardner?
I would like to get it on the record.
Apologies, Your Honor.
I was commenting,
"Are there any other judges in the military?"
Good. To answer your question,
yes, there are.
And yet, here I am again.
Happy days.
Captain Moyer, you have no objection
to the accused's civilian representation?
We don't, Your Honor. We welcome it.
Although it is a bit crowded at the defense table.
I imagine you can hold your own.
Are there any motions before we call the panel?
You take it; she hates me.
Was that also something you wanted to share, Mr. Gardner?
Yes, Your Honor.
I told Mrs. Florrick, "You take it; she hates me."
You wound me, sir.
What do you have for me, ma'am?
We ask the court's assistance
in transporting a witness for the defense.
A Lieutenant Matt Ventura.
He was the pilot that was stationed
with our client at the UAS,
and he has firsthand knowledge of these events.
Captain Moyer, do you have any objection to this?
We don't, Your Honor. In fact,
we've already transported him
as a witness for the prosecution.
Well, that's awkward.
Isn't it?
What's most important is that
we run an ethical and clean investigation.
That's the best way to honor the state's attorney's directive.
Now, I understand you have evidence of theft and bribery.
Not evidence, suspicions.
More than suspicions--
the $45,000 Will Gardner stole.
That was 15 years ago;
the statute of limitations has expired.
What about his connection to Judge Baxter?
Yes. I think we should start there.
No.
We don't need that to get to Lemond Bishop.
Yes, well, that's what I most want to talk about.
I know the plan was to use Mr. Gardner
as a stepping stone to his drug-dealing client,
but I believe we should use Mr. Gardner
as a stepping stone... to Mr. Gardner.
I understand you have a source in Lockhart/Gardner.
I do.
The investigator, Kalinda Sharma.
Good. Cultivate that.
Hang on a minute.
Wasn't the directive of this investigation to pursue drugs,
Mrs. Scott-Carr?
It was.
And we could be concerned about Mission Creep here.
But Mr. Florrick has given me
the autonomy to set objectives.
And in looking at the evidence,
I believe the more profitable direction
is judicial corruption.
How does that sound?
Good to me.
Me, too.
So, you saw the alert from the ground commander warning that
there were civilians in the vicinity.
Yes, sir.
There are sometimes delays in the transmission of such alerts.
Did you experience any delays here?
No, there were no delays, sir.
Then why did the accused ignore the warning?
Objection,
it's not determined yet
that Staff Sergeant Elkins ignored anything.
Overruled.
I don't know why Sergeant Elkins ignored it, sir.
I was stunned when she fired on the target.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
And thank you for your service to this country.
Your Honor, we ask for a five-minute recess.
Denied.
Don't impeach him.
Use him to ask the question.
Lieutenant, have there been other civilian deaths
due to drone maneuvers?
Other Afghan deaths?
Yes.
There have.
How many?
Uh, I don't know.
But there have been civilian deaths.
Not intentional civilian deaths, accidental.
Yes.
Our drones are accurate, but we can't control everything
that happens on the ground in Afghanistan.
In fact, aren't civilian casualties such a common occurrence
that they have been assigned the slang term "Squirters"?
No, ma'am, that's incorrect.
Oh, my apologies.
In the week before the arrest of Staff Sergeant Elkins,
weren't eight civilians killed in a drone attack
on the al-Qaeda operative, Amad al Dasari?
I believe nine were killed.
Excuse me, nine.
And how many drone operators were arrested in that attack?
How many?
Yes.
None, to my knowledge.
And how many prosecutions and arrests
have resulted from any of these civilian deaths?
None.
So I'm trying to figure this out.
Even though you're in a trailer
20 miles north of Las Vegas,
you do consider yourself part of the battlefield in Afghanistan?
Yes, of course.
And, like many of the men and the women
on this jury, you have been in battle,
even though you don't have any war wounds to show for it?
That's correct, ma'am.
So, Staff Sergeant Elkins was in battle, too, wasn't she?
Yes.
So this is a prosecution of a soldier
who accidentally killed a civilian on the battlefield, isn't it?
Objection.
Sustained.
That's okay. I think the jury understands.
Mrs. Florrick!
Yes, that's right.
Keep it casual, don't see me
until... hark!
There you are.
I was rushing over here, rehearsing my apology.
Can I just say I am so sorry?
Oh, did you, uh, order me something?
Just a little cheese and fruit.
You are such a kick, Eli.
Well, I hope this means you forgive me.
It does.
I blame myself for not seeing it coming.
Oh, come on, there was nothing to see.
I was just offered the Fruit Association job yesterday.
Smile, Eli, so I know you're okay.
I'm not gonna let you go.
You're too cute to let go.
No, you're the cute one.
Did anyone ever tell you, you have a prerecorded voice?
A what? No, what is that?
One of those credit card voices
that tells you your call will be answered
in the order received.
I got to borrow that one.
So, on the phone, you mentioned something
about us working together?
Yes.
The Dairy Guild and the Fruit Association are natural allies.
We have a mutual enemy.
Vegetables?
Yes.
You lost real estate.
Vegetables gained real estate at your expense.
That's what I keep telling the fruit growers.
Well, what do you propose?
Combine our lobbying efforts.
I want to say yes, Eli,
but you can't keep going after the pyramid.
So what should we do?
Well, without acknowledging we're a "We" yet,
you should create a new diagram.
And if we do?
Well, show it to me.
Fruit and cheese are natural allies here, right?
She said yes, Eli?
Yes, but she's lying.
She said yes too quickly.
She's either already talking to the vegetable lobby,
or she'll use our interest to up their interest.
You got all of this from "Yes"?
I need to talk to the bread people.
Eli, our clients don't want to go there.
I'll talk to them; it's the only way to beat this lady.
We are not trying to beat this lady, Eli;
we're just trying to do well by our client.
I got to go.
Andrew R. Galecki.
I work at Langley as a military analyst.
And you were part of the sensor-to-shooter
decision chain on the drone maneuver?
Yes, the kill chain.
Now, the defense has argued that there are many deaths
in UAS maneuvers, and this is just one more.
Is that true?
There is, in fact collateral damage in drone maneuvers,
but most of these deaths are taken into account
in the kill chain algorithm.
You'll have to explain that, sir.
We take into account the strategic value
of eliminating a target,
the potential damage to civilians,
and the proximity to mosques, schools, or hospitals.
This is all entered into a computer algorithm,
which determines the worthiness of an attack.
So there are some deaths of civilians
that are deemed appropriate.
Unfortunately, yes, sometimes the value of killing
an al-Qaeda target outweighs killing civilians.
That was the case
with the al-Qaeda operative, Amad al Dasari?
The defense has argued that someone should have been arrested
in that attack because civilians were killed.
No, that attack was sanctioned.
We were willing to risk more deaths
because Mr. Al Dasari was such a danger to the United States.
And the drone attack, initiated by the accused?
That was not a sanctioned attack.
We sent out an immediate transmission
when we saw children in the area.
The accused took it upon herself to fire anyway.
How many women are on the jury?
Six.
We should argue she's being prosecuted
because she's a woman.
It's not true, and even if it were,it doesn't matter.
Why isn't it true?
The pilot isn't being prosecuted,
none of her commanders, all men.
Do we know that?
Check the transcripts.
I thought it was all male names.
It won't work.
The panel will consider it whining.
What defense would they consider not whining?
What'd you find?
Um, nothing.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
It's not gonna work.
What's not gonna work?
Seducing me.
I don't want to seduce you.
You don't?
No.
Too easy.
Hey.
I mean, what's the point anyway? I don't get it.
Without a penis involved?
That's like baseball without a bat.
Well, you get it when you get it.
Oh... Deep.
It's different.
A woman's lips, and when you get a woman excited...
It's not like a man.
I hope not.
It's not aggressive.
It's slow.
Suspenseful.
You want to hurt Cary?
No.
Yeah, you do.
That's okay, he wants to hurt you, too.
Really? And how does he want to do that?
Through me.
How's he gonna do that through you?
There's a special prosecutor.
Wendy Scott-Carr.
Yep.
And we're not going after Lemond Bishop.
We are going after Will Gardner.
On what?
Bribery, banging judges.
Did I say banging?
You did.
I meant bribing.
I need to get a cab.
Here's my money.
I got it.
No, no, no, I got it, I got it.
You all right?
I said it would take more than just a few shots
to get me into bed.
Then what?
I asked her what it was like to make love to a woman.
You want to know what she said?
When we get excited, you can feel it.
Did she want to touch you?
She wanted me like this.
Thank you.
So what were you were looking for?
Just seeing if someone was looking through my files.
Well, your history's right here,
which should show you which files were opened.
How far back?
Saturday.
Nope. Nothing on Saturday.
Your webcam was on, but that's about it.
What's up?
What'd she do?
Nothing. I just want to create stronger boundaries.
I think your grandmother misses being involved in our lives,
and... I want to talk to her about that.
Well, Dad sends her to pick us up.
I know. And I'll talk to your dad,
but I don't know if I can change that.
So you just want us to keep her out of the apartment?
She went through your laptop, didn't she?
What?
Grandma went through Mom's laptop.
I don't know that. I don't know.
Your dad and I are being very good with each other these days,
and I just don't want Jackie getting in the way of that.
What was she looking for?
I don't even know that she was.
Here. Take these keys, and let me know
if there are any problems.
Mom, what does she want?
I think your grandmother...
wants sole custody for your dad.
What?
Mom, we're not six.
I know. She wishes you were.
Is she looking for things you did wrong?
I don't know, okay?
I just... I want to be safe, that's all.
Is there anything on there?
No.
Mom, are you all right?
I am, I...
I just have to get this figured out, that's all.
We have to watch Grandma.
I know.
She's such a bitch.
Your call is very important to us.
Please stay on the line
and your call will be answered in the order...
It's her. It's her voice.
Bread, Eli.
Our interests are identical.
Bread.
Dairy. You have suffered
the most from the MyPlate design.
Bread used to hold the prominent spot on the pyramid.
Now it is classified as grains.
So what do we do?
Combine our lobbying interests.
It's not going to help.
It's all about vegetables these days.
What food holds the most sway over Congress?
What food receives $3.5 billion a year in food subsidies?
Corn?
That's right.
Corn has always been classified as a vegetable,
but it's just as much a grain.
How are you, Gina?
I'm good, ma'am.
Are you in touch with your parents?
I am.
Are they coming?
No.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Anything at all?
No.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
All rise!
Staff Sergeant Nora Swan,
Aircraft Structural Maintenance.
And the accused was your bunkmate at Addis Air Force Base?
Yes, sir.
And what did you observe
your bunkmate doing on the morning in question?
Ingesting Adriphan.
This is a prescription stimulant
used to combat shift-work sleep disorder?
Yes, sir.
It keeps you awake?
Yes, sir.
But it can also overstimulate, cause someone to overreact...
Objection. Beyond the expertise.
I'll rephrase.
Have you ever been warned about the side effects of Adriphan?
Yes, sir.
It can make you jumpy.
React too quickly to stimuli.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Sergeant, where did Staff Sergeant Elkins get these pills?
They were... Mine.
So you have a prescription for them?
No.
But you were taking them--
these pills that tend to overstimulate?
I was.
Why?
We're in double-shifts on some days on maintenance.
You know, it's-it's the only way to stay awake.
And you were fine with the risk of being overstimulated?
Objection.
I'll rephrase.
You testified that you did not
have a prescription for these pills,
so where did you get them?
Where?
Yes, if you didn't get them from a medical specialist,
you must have gotten them from somewhere.
I...
I-I'd rather not say.
Yes, and I'd rather not ask.
From someone in the unit, ma'am.
Do other people in the unit take these pills?
Yes.
In fact, isn't it an open secret that Adriphan
is taken by almost everyone, from fighter pilots to...?
Objection, Your Honor. Calls for speculation.
Actually, I don't think it calls for much speculation at all.
Mrs. Florrick!
My apologies, Your Honor.
No further questions.
My parents always wanted me to take the corporate path.
But you were the rebel?
I tried being a defense attorney, but...
I realized I didn't like guilty people.
Not that you do.
Oh, no, I do. I love them.
That's why I work here.
This isn't going to go well, is it?
Nope.
This is where I sat when I was waiting to be fired.
Really?
Do you have children, Diane?
I don't.
Well, i found the best way to raise mine
was to tell them exactly what is expected of them,
how they misbehaved, and what they have to do
to get back in my good graces.
I didn't even know you had graces,
and suddenly I seem to be out of them.
No. I'm speaking of your partner.
Ah, Will. Well, actually, he's in court right now.
But why don't I tell him you dropped by?
Diane, I am leading an investigation into judicial bribery.
There are three judges on the bench
who are receiving payments in trade for their decisions.
Really?
Who?
We believe the nexus of that bribery scheme is Will Gardner.
It's always nice to know how my tax dollars are being spent.
Mr. Gardner has a Wednesday night pick-up game
involving lawyers and judges.
At these games, he's introduced judges to bookies
for the purposes of illegal betting.
The judges quickly get sucked into bigger bets,
at which time the bookies forgive the debt
in trade for friendly sentences.
One thing I've noticed about prosecutors, Ms. Scott-Carr:
they tend to treat accusations as facts.
We know your hands are clean, Diane.
How do we know that?
You're right.
We don't know your hands are clean.
You can demonstrate your hands are clean by talking with us.
Well, look at this, my two favorite people.
Cary.
Kalinda.
Did you get home all right?
I did. Thank you. Whew, hangover.
Nice jacket.
Thanks. I think it's the same label.
Thank you for the time.
No problem.
Where's Will?
He's parking.
Do you have a minute?
You're being investigated.
I know. It's winding down.
It's not winding down.
Peter Florrick just assigned Wendy Scott-Carr
as a special prosecutor.
How do you know?
She was just in my office,
trying to turn me against you.
It's about Lemond Bishop. They're trying to use me...
No, it's not.
We need to get out of the Lemond Bishop business...
Will, it's not. They're coming after you.
They say that just to scare you.
They say that because they have something.
Judicial bribery.
What?
Your Wednesday night basketball games.
She thinks you're introducing judges to bookies.
What?
The judges bet on games, they can't pay;
the bookies relieve the debt in trade for a lesser sentence.
I don't want you to say anything to me...
but I want you to take care of this.
I will not let this firm go under
because of some S.A. fishing expedition...
Diane, it's not true...
Of course it's not true.
That's not the point.
Make it go away.
Stop it.
Stop...?
Alicia.
Peter Florrick is coming after you because you are sleeping with his wife.
Don't lie to me.
It's wrong.
You are her boss. He is the state's attorney.
Even if it weren't wrong, it's not smart.
Stop sleeping with his wife.
Do you understand me?
You, gentlemen, are a grain, you are not a vegetable.
In fact, other vegetables gain more
by being associated with you than you with them.
That is why you were left with MyPlate.
Where is corn?
It is subsumed in "Vegetables."
But we aim to change all that.
With this.
A full-body food chart.
With sections for fruits, dairy, breads.
And here... Corn is at the heart.
A place of prominence.
To reflect its importance in the American diet.
It is to all our benefit to rethink the current food chart.
And we need your help to encourage Congress to...
Chin up.
Eli. Hi, how are you?
I'm good. So you're here...?
Oh, just to chat with a few friends.
Really? How nice.
Arthur, hi.
So you're trying to pull corn on board?
On board?
With you.
Well, it's produce, isn't it?
I thought we had a deal.
Really?
Cheese and fruit?
That was our agreement.
When you're dead, Eli, you know what the polite thing is to do?
Get a shovel.
We think you should take Ventura.
Why?
The sexism angle will come better from you.
We're worried it'll seem
like outsiders meddling if we go tough on him.
Understood.
All rise!
Uh, thank you for returning, Lieutenant Ventura.
Um, you have testified that, uh,
there was no delay in the stand-down transmission
from the kill chain and that, therefore,
uh, Staff Sergeant Elkins overreacted.
Yes, sir.
Good. Okay.
So, uh...
Okay. Um...
Uh, so, um...
have there been transmission delays in the past? Have there been?
Yes, but there wasn't one here.
Sergeant Elkins ignored the order.
I see.
And is that why you started an online petition in the spring
opposing the integration of females into the submarine force?
Because females can't take orders?
Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.
I... Sustained.
Lieutenant Ventura,
have you worked with other female airmen in the UAV complex?
Yes, definitely.
And you have no issues working with female NCOs?
No, of course not. Why?
Because I'm asking you a question.
Lieutenant Ventura,
who is Staff Sergeant Montoya?
Sergeant Montoya worked as a sensor operator
in the UAV last year. She has since been removed.
And she was removed because you complained about her?
No, sir. She was being disruptive during our shifts.
So you had her replaced?
No, i told my commanding officer, and he replaced her.
Understood.
And how many other NCOs have you worked beside without incident?
Dozens. This was my first incident.
A female?
Yes, but that's incidental.
So it's incidental that out of the dozens
of NCOs you've worked with over the years,
you've had complaints only about two females?
Yes, sir.
Who works with you now?
I don't understand the question.
Now that you've had Staff Sergeant Elkins replaced...
Objection.
Sustained.
Now that you're working with someone other than Staff Sergeant Elkins,
are there any complaints?
No. I work well with people.
Is Staff Sergeant Elkins' replacement a male or a female?
A male.
Understood.
Thank you for your honesty.
Hello, Jackie.
Alicia.
I-I was, uh...
My key seems to be sticking.
I know.
You changed the locks?
I did.
Would you like to explain why?
Sure. I don't want you in here anymore.
You don't want me picking up Zach and Grace?
I don't.
But I can't control what Peter needs from you.
What you need from me, too, Alicia.
But I can control my home.
I don't want you in here, Jackie.
I don't want you going through my things.
I don't want you in my computer.
You're hurting your children.
I might be, but that's between me and them,
and I would never take your word for it.
They're not safe with you.
Go ahead, Jackie-- reach into that bag of tricks.
What do you have that could hurt me?
Zach is dating Eli Gold's daughter.
Oh, my gosh. That's terrible.
They were in your bedroom.
Should I get a chair for this?
Grace goes into her bedroom with her tutor and locks the door.
Well, it would help if you got your facts straight, Jackie.
There is no lock on Grace's door.
She pushes the chair against it.
Look at me, Jackie.
Look at my face.
You no longer have the power to wound.
They're your children.
You need to be their mother.
Good night, Jackie.
Zach?
Hey, Mom. What's up?
Jackie drives you over to Dad's now?
Yeah. Why?
Get your coat. Let's buy you a car.
No, I understand. I'll just keep in touch.
Thank you.
That didn't sound good.
We're out of the cheese business.
The dairy people want a change of direction.
They're going with Stacie Hall.
I explained she made no sense since she represents fruit, too.
But they thought a nonsensical plan made more sense than I did.
I need something to drink.
Well, don't get morose.
Why not?
It deserves a little wallowing, don't you think?
Four or five million a year between us.
Nora, why don't I have Scotch?!
Win them back.
Oh, yes, you're right.
What was I thinking?
Do men really have that much success in their life
that the first setback that comes along,
they get all weepy?
I'm not weepy.
I'm...
I'm tired.
It's hard doing this.
I don't sleep at night.
I stare at the clock, I think about nothing else.
And it's not productive time.
It's stare-at-the-clock time.
You can always give up.
Can I just have a minute to feel bad for myself?
Yes, I'm sorry.
I don't like losing.
I'm always looking for when things start to turn south.
What if it's now?
Eli, we're gonna wallow for a few hours now.
We'll drink.
I'll put you in a cab.
You will sleep it off.
You won't feel good in the morning.
You will come in late, but you will come in.
We'll sit, we'll talk.
You've been lording it over us up until now.
I have not.
Yes, you have. Don't argue.
You are brilliant, but you're not God's gift.
We'll sit and talk.
We'll hatch a plan.
And Stacie Hall is going to rue the day.
And that's a fact.
But for the moment...
Members of the panel, have you reached a verdict?
Staff Sergeant Regina Elkins, please stand.
"In the matter of The United States v.
"Staff Sergeant Regina E. Elkins,
"On the charge of murder under Section 118 of the Uniform Code
"Of Military Justice, count one,
"We the panel find the accused guilty.
"On the charge of murder under Section 118
"Of the Uniform Code, count two,
"We the panel find the accused guilty.
"On the charge of murder under Section 118 of the Uniform Code,
"Count three, we the panel find the accused guilty.
"On the charge of murder under Section 118
"Of the Uniform Code, count four,
we the panel find the accused guilty."
You thought it was unjust?
Yes.
Why?
She was scapegoated.
She's being sent to prison
because she was used as a scapegoat
for an inaccurate drone program.
No. She was convicted because she did wrong.
She was a woman, that was her only...
Oh, please.
Do you know what that defense says
about the thousands of women who serve honorably?
We don't want that defense.
This isn't about want. This is about truth.
And the truth is there are 12 people dead
because of Sergeant Elkins' actions.
She went to work incapacitated by drugs
and she killed 12 people. Six children.
You didn't ask one word about them.
They are dead.
They burned to death.
Children like yours.
Children like mine.
Their mothers are mourning them right now.
She may be pushing buttons, but they are dead.
And they did nothing wrong.
This was a just verdict.
It was.
And she will serve time for that.
The problem with the charge of scapegoating is
that it doesn't acknowledge at a certain point
you have to hold people accountable.
That is what's happening here.
That's all.
I have to go now.
