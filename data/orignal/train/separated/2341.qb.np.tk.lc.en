for over a century i have lived in secret .
until now . i know the risk ,
but i have to know her .
what are you ?
i &apos;m a vampire .
tell me about your ex. katherine ?
she broke your heart .
that was a long time ago .
why do i look like her ?
what &apos;s your problem ?
i don &apos;t know. ok ?
so , the black sheep returns .
tyler ?
who &apos;s the guy with carol ?
mason lockwood .
i think the lockwoods have a family secret .
they &apos;re not vampires . they &apos;re something else .
i love stefan . it &apos;s always going to be stefan .
no , damon . stop it !
it &apos;s katherine . she undid everything that was good about him .
i hate him , stefan .
i &apos;ve had her blood .
katherine obviously killed her .
&quot; a &quot; plus &quot; b &quot; equals ...
because i &apos;m starving .
thanks for coming , ric .
you need something to drink ? coffee ? bourbon ?
bourbon in your coffee ?
elena mentioned you needed my help .
yeah . we were hoping you could help shed some light
on the lockwood family .
now , why would i know anything about the lockwoods ?
well , you wouldn &apos;t . but your dead--
not dead vampire wife might .
isobel &apos;s research ,
from when you guys were at duke together .
you said that she had spent years researching this town .
isobel &apos;s research here-- mystic falls--
was rooted in folklore and legend .
at the time , i thought most of which was fiction .
like that amazing vampire story .
aside from vampires , what else ?
lycanthrope .
wait . like werewolves ?
no way . impossible . way too lon chaney .
is it ?
i &apos;ve been on this planet 160 @-@ some odd years .
i &apos;ve never come across one .
if werewolves exist , where the hell are they ?
well , why do you suspect the lockwoods ?
because vervain didn &apos;t effect the mayor on founders &apos; day .
but the gilbert device did .
and it effected his son tyler .
and at the school carnival , his uncle mason exhibited
inhuman behavior when he fought one of the carnival workers .
it suggested some sort of a supernatural entity .
we were hoping that isobel &apos;s research
could help us figure out what it is .
a lot of her things are still at duke .
i mean , her office is still there .
she &apos;s technically still missing .
so can we get access to it ?
ric , we need to know what we &apos;re dealing with .
if this wolfman thing is true ,
i &apos;ve seen enough movies to know it &apos;s not good .
it means that mason lockwood is a real @-@ life lon chaney .
and that little tyler punk may
just very well be lon chaney junior .
which means bela lugosi-- meaning me--
is totally screwed .
caroline ?
caroline ?
it &apos;s caroline . leave a message .
hey , i thought you said you were at home .
tyler &apos;s doing a whole thing at the swimming hole .
and i wanted us to spend the day together .
where are you ? call me .
you sure you want to do this ?
which part ?
digging through my birth mother &apos;s lifework
or going to duke with damon ?
either . both .
well , i &apos;m sure about the first part .
but then again , ric is a good buffer .
so we can bond in our anti @-@ damon solidarity .
i wish you were coming , though .
you know what , maybe we should wait a couple of days , huh ?
wait till caroline &apos;s less of a danger ,
and then i can go with you .
it &apos;s ok that i &apos;m going , right ?
and be honest . because if it &apos;s
not then i can just stay here .
and we can take care of caroline .
no , listen . i want you to go . ok ? i do .
you have questions about your lineage and about katherine .
look , i &apos;m not going to let the fact that damon is going
keep you from an opportunity to get some answers .
you hate it , though .
i hate it . and i love you .
i love you , too .
it &apos;s been a while .
well , school &apos;s been keeping me really busy .
i want you to know it means a lot to me
that elena has a connection to her mother .
i appreciate you bringing her along today .
yeah . well , i figured it was time to ...
take care of my wife &apos;s things , you know ?
look , jenna , i know ...
things between you and i have been a little start and stop .
and i &apos;m sorry for that .
but maybe once i can--
uh , no . don &apos;t do that .
not the half , maybe apology , hope for the future thing .
elena , you coming ?
do what you need to do , ok ?
hey , you ok ?
yeah . just men and their baggage .
sorry you can &apos;t come too , stef .
call me if you need anything .
oh , i &apos;ll take really good care of her .
ok . time to go .
have you ever been down to those old ruins in the woods ?
the old lockwood estate ?
yeah . what do you know about it ?
it was the original plantation house .
beautiful antebellum architecture .
and if it hadn &apos;t burnt to the ground ,
we &apos;d probably be living in it .
what &apos;s the deal with the freaky underground cellar ?
we don &apos;t talk about those kind of rooms .
why not ?
well , this is the south , honey .
but no one likes to reminisce about the old slave days .
what are you guys talking about ?
we were just talking about the old lockwood property .
thinking about having some friends over to the swim hole .
well , be careful . if anything happens on the property ,
the family is liable .
of course .
i don &apos;t know how to make a daywalking ring .
emily made mine . she made damon &apos;s , too .
instructions must be in the grimoire .
doesn &apos;t mean i can cast a spell .
bonnie .
you know how to drop vampires with a single look .
ok ? i think you can figure it out .
caroline killed someone , stefan .
i can &apos;t make it easier for her to do it again .
no . we &apos;re not making it easier for her .
we &apos;re just giving her the chance to survive .
listen , everyday that she &apos;s cut off from her old life--
from you , from elena , from matt--
it &apos;ll make it that much harder for her to hold on to her humanity .
and how do you know she won &apos;t hurt anyone else ?
i don &apos;t .
but if we don &apos;t do everything we can to help her--
or at least trust the fact that she can keep it together ,
we might as well just stake her right now .
i don &apos;t know if i can trust her .
not with this .
then trust me .
how you doing back there ?
leave her alone .
you know , this whole pretending to hate me thing is getting a little silly .
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s pretending .
you did kill her brother .
there is a huge asterisk next to that statement .
he came back to life .
yeah . thanks to a ring that you didn &apos;t know he was wearing .
why are you so sure i didn &apos;t know ?
did you ?
yes .
you &apos;re lying .
elena , i saw the ring .
big tacky thing .
it &apos;s hard to miss .
so , i don &apos;t get to choose the ring i
have to wear the rest of my life
hey , if you don &apos;t want it ...
no . she--she wants it .
now what ?
now &apos;s the part where i explain the rules .
the witch who spells the ring has the power to de @-@ spell it .
so , if you ever do anything to hurt anyone ...
i &apos;m not going to hurt anyone .
you &apos;re a vampire .
that means the urge to kill is a part of who you are .
the minute you let it take over , i will stop you .
bonnie , you &apos;re supposed to be my friend .
i can &apos;t ignore what happened . ok ?
if you want to be friends , you &apos;re going to have to prove
that the caroline i remember isn &apos;t gone .
now , put the ring on the bed .
do you really think i meant to
kill that guy at the carnival
he &apos;s still dead .
now , do you want me to cast the spell or not ?
all done .
so , that &apos;s it ?
i mean , nothing witchy happened .
you know , no flickering lights , no gust of wind .
have you even done this before ?
caroline ...
well , i just want to make sure it worked !
it worked .
what if it hadn &apos;t , bonnie ? !
she &apos;s all yours .
so isobel was officially employed by the anthropology department ,
given that most paranormal phenomena is rooted in folklore .
excuse me . hi , i &apos;m alaric saltzman .
i called earlier .
yes . of course .
i &apos;m vanessa monroe , research assistant--
comparative folklore .
uh , let me just grab isobel &apos;s keys .
i &apos;m sorry . these are my friends elena and damon .
i hope this isn &apos;t too much of an imposition .
please . isobel &apos;s office is right through there .
isobel was one of my first professors .
i &apos;m a grad student . she was brilliant .
one of the reasons i went into folklore .
i have to ask ...
has there been any news ?
no . no . i &apos;m afraid not .
it &apos;s right this way .
i &apos;ll grab the light . feel free to look around .
it &apos;s fascinating , isn &apos;t it ?
where &apos;d she go ?
pull it out . i can &apos;t reach it , elena .
just pull the damn thing out . it hurts .
that bitch is dead .
uh , you &apos;re not going to kill her .
watch me .
you touch her and i swear i will never speak to you again .
what makes you think that has any power over me ?
&apos;cause i took an arrow in the back for you ?
you are severely overestimating yourself .
right . i forgot that i was speaking to a psychotic mind
who snaps and kills people impulsively .
fine . go ahead . do whatever you want .
you &apos;re trying to manipulate me .
if by &quot; manipulate &quot; you mean tell the truth , ok .
guilty .
please ! ok . i freaked .
all right , you would have done the same thing .
it &apos;s not possible
katherine pierce can &apos;t be alive .
and damon salvatore died in 1864 .
ok . i read isobel &apos;s research .
well , then you should know just how possible this is .
i &apos;m elena gilbert ,
isobel &apos;s daughter .
and a descendent of katherine pierce .
and this is damon salvatore , who you just shot .
i &apos;d be extra nice to me right now .
look . we need your help .
ok . we need to see all of isobel &apos;s research ,
anything related to mystic falls .
so what do i do when i see the rabbit ?
chase it , catch it , feed on it .
isn &apos;t killing cute , defenseless animals
the first step in becoming a serial killer ?
well , you sort of skipped serial killer
and went straight to vampire .
hey , caroline , if you &apos;re not serious about all this ,
i think you should tell me .
no . i am .
look , i swear that i am ! ok .
but it &apos;s just ...
i haven &apos;t been in the sun for days .
and everyone &apos;s at the swimming hole having fun ,
and matt is there . and he finally told me that he loved me .
but i &apos;ve been blowing him off .
and now you want me to eat bunnies .
and i &apos;m kinda freaking out , ok ? !
and now you &apos;re laughing at me .
no. no . i &apos;m not laughing .
none of this is funny , trust me .
it &apos;s just that , uh ...
what ? !
when somebody becomes a vampire ,
all their natural behaviors get sort of amplified .
what do you mean ?
i mean , as a human i cared deeply
for people how they felt , if they were hurting ,
i felt their pain .
and i felt guilty , if i was the one that caused it .
and as a vampire ,
all of that got ...
magnified .
so you &apos;re saying that now i &apos;m basically an insecure ,
neurotic , out of control freak on crack .
well , i wasn &apos;t gonna say it like that .
but ...
hey , listen . let &apos;s hunt . ok ?
and then after that ,
we &apos;ll go to the swimming hole .
really ? !
yeah .
matt is the closet connection
that you have to your humanity .
and i think that being around him is a good thing .
ok !
come on .
ok .
this box tracks katherine &apos;s arrival to mystic falls
in april of 1864 .
is that all there is about her ?
all that i &apos;m aware of .
here .
take this .
does vervain really work ?
nope ! not at all .
can he hear us ?
no ! that would be creepy !
can he read minds , too ?
you know , if you want to see me naked ,
all you have to do is ask .
no . that , he can &apos;t do .
he is very capable of being a first rate jackass .
is it me , or did amy bradley &apos;s ass get hot ?
all class .
where &apos;s forbes ?
i wish i knew .
you guys on the outs already ?
no . we &apos;re fine . i &apos;m fine .
just not sure what she is .
what &apos;s your uncle doing here ?
you busting us , or you joining us ?
neither .
hoping you can make sure everyone &apos;s out of here by dark .
what happens after dark ?
someone ends up wasted and dead
at the bottom of the lake .
you heard your mom . the family &apos;s liable if anything happens .
don &apos;t be a party killer .
hey , i didn &apos;t say you had to stop partying .
i just said you have to take it elsewhere .
all right .
we &apos;ll be out of here .
why are you looking at him with your serious vampire look ?
my what ? my &quot; serious vampire look &quot; ?
mm @-@ hmm . i mean , it &apos;s different from your worried vampire look .
neither of which stray too far from your
&quot; hey , it &apos;s tuesday &quot; look .
oh . i get it . ok .
you think i &apos;m , uh , you think i &apos;m too serious .
i mean , i wasn &apos;t going to say it like that . but ...
hey , amy .
you know , you &apos;re missing all the fun in the water .
ah , not waterproof .
too bad .
so , there &apos;s a full moon tonight .
we gonna light a fire later and tell ghost stories ?
uh , i don &apos;t know .
matt .
what the hell ? i &apos;ve been calling you .
i know , i got held up . but i &apos;m here now .
hey , caroline .
go find somebody single to stalk , amy .
seriously ?
she was flirting with you .
she &apos;s harmless . you don &apos;t have to be rude .
you &apos;re mad ?
you &apos;ve been dodging my calls all day .
and you get to show up here and be the jealous girlfriend ?
it &apos;s kinda lame , care .
hey , i saw that . you compelled her .
yeah , she deserved it .
caroline , nobody deserves to have their mind messed with for ...
shallow reasons .
you know , why is everyone sticking up for
amy freaking bradley ?
you &apos;re letting your jealousy get the best of you .
oh , so now i have magnified jealousy issues too .
that &apos;s great .
i told you this wasn &apos;t going to be easy .
yeah , well . might as well have stayed dead .
my entire personality is killing me .
shut up .
any luck ?
there &apos;s nothing in here about
katherine that we don &apos;t already know .
ah , man .
you know , it &apos;s a bummer we &apos;re not friends anymore .
because i can tell you what i know .
now who &apos;s manipulating who ?
hey , guys . check this out .
there &apos;s no record of werewolf mythology in mystic falls .
but here are some records of some of the lesser known legends .
everything from scandinavian skinwalkers to the marshallderats .
which roughly translates into
&quot; the curse of the sun and moon . &quot;
it &apos;s native american .
aztec .
it explains one origin of the werewolf
curse traced through virginia .
the short story ... 600 years ago ,
the aztecs were plagued by werewolves and vampires .
they terrorized the countryside ,
made farming and hunting impossible .
until an aztec shaman cursed them ,
making vampires slaves to the sun and
werewolves servants of the moon .
as a result , vampires could only prowl at night ,
and werewolves could only turn on a full moon .
when the full moon crests in the sky ,
whosever unlucky enough to fall under
the werewolf curse turns into a wolf .
can they control the transformation ?
if it were a choice , it wouldn &apos;t be called a curse .
werewolves will attack humans .
but instinct and centuries of rivalry
have hardwired them to hunt their prey of choice ...
vampires .
well , if werewolves are hunting vampires , i would know about it .
not if there aren &apos;t that many werewolves left alive .
hundreds of years ago , vampires hunted them almost to extinction .
why would they do that ?
to protect themselves .
legend has it that a werewolf bite is fatal to vampires .
he &apos;s mad at me .
go talk to him .
i &apos;ll wait .
hi . listen . we &apos;ve learned some stuff here .
and i know it &apos;s going to sound crazy .
but i wanted to fill you in .
what &apos;s up ?
still mad ?
i thought we were past all this insecurity stuff , caroline .
i told you how i felt about you .
what more do you need ?
nothing . nothing .
i-- i don &apos;t need anything else .
i &apos;m sorry , matt . i &apos;m so sorry .
i &apos;m so , so , so , so sorry .
i &apos;m not kidding . i &apos;m not going to put up with the drama .
no . no more drama .
just-- i promise-- just .
just this .
come on .
i don &apos;t know what it means
or if we should even believe it .
but it &apos;s a full moon , stefan .
after what you saw mason lockwood do--
i &apos;ll be careful .
there &apos;s one more thing .
what is it ?
according to the legend , a werewolf bite can kill a vampire .
listen , i gotta go .
i &apos;ll see you when you get home . ok ?
ok .
not much farther , amy .
really , tyler ? you drag me all the way out here ?
i had to move the party . so i &apos;m moving the party .
where are we going ?
it &apos;s right around this tree .
are you sure ?
oh , yeah . come on .
ok .
what is this place ?
it &apos;s a room buried underneath my family &apos;s old estate .
no one will know we &apos;re down here .
is everyone else coming ?
yeah . unless you rather i tell them not to .
you &apos;re single , right ?
oh , yeah .
let &apos;s go .
have you done any research on doppelgangers ?
well , the word means a lot of different
things to different cultures .
but typically a doppelganger
is a living , breathing double of oneself .
did isobel have anything that &apos;d explain
the link between me and katherine ?
that &apos;s all she had on katherine , unfortunately .
but i can tell you
that doppelgangers usually torment the people they look like ,
trying to undo their lives .
it &apos;s not exactly uplifting .
and more things we already know .
just-- i want to know why we look alike .
head- scratcher , isn &apos;t it ?
do you know something or are you just being yourself ?
well , &quot; if &quot; i know anything ,
i &apos;m not going to tell you , not with that attitude .
that &apos;s good , damon .
and this is coming from someone who wants to be my friend .
but you know what ?
friends don &apos;t manipulate friends .
they help each other .
wait . wait . no . i &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s the deal ? come on .
no , no , no . wait , wait , wait . i can &apos;t
i &apos;m not into it .
then why &apos;d you come with me ?
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m not even really sure i was flirting with you .
i like matt .
ouch .
um ... ok .
i &apos;m gonna go .
yeah .
sorry !
i mean ...
i trust you not to say anything about this to anyone .
or else damon will kill me in my sleep ?
he gave me the 411 .
but if you need anything , you can call .
hopefully i won &apos;t have to .
but if you do ...
listen , you don &apos;t want to get caught up in this .
really . it &apos;ll take over .
and it &apos;ll keep you from being able to live your life .
isobel &apos;s disappearance ...
was it related to her research ?
isobel became her research .
she wanted to become a vampire .
she got her wish .
i guess that would put a strain on a marriage .
anyway , i was wondering
what it would be like to come back here .
it &apos;s uh ... it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s really ok .
feels good to ...
have her in my past .
you know , it &apos;s ... time to move beyond this .
here .
allow me .
you &apos;re not going to be able to hate me forever .
can we just go ?
you didn &apos;t dig deep enough .
&quot; petrova . &quot;
i saw this on the shelf .
katherine originally came from europe .
petrova was her real name .
katharina petrova to be exact .
how did you know that ?
back when , i saw it engraved on an old heirloom .
men snoop , too , you know .
let me know what you find . very curious myself .
you have every right to hate me .
i understand .
you hated me before and we became friends .
it would suck if that was gone forever .
so ...
is it ?
have i lost you forever ?
thank you for the book , damon .
this looks like the spot .
for what ?
did you hear that ?
what happens ?
what are you doing ?
caroline ?
caroline ! caroline !
caroline !
what the hell--your face !
stop it ! stop ! stop ! stop !
stop .
oh , my god .
no , no , stop . listen to me .
we need to get out of these woods now .
we need to leave .
what was that ?
matt , stay down . do not move .
you and me , we &apos;re gonna run .
it &apos;s gonna follow us . we need to get it away from matt .
so , you need to run as fast as you can .
do you understand me ?
go . go !
wait ! what is it ? !
it &apos;s a werewolf !
it will try to kill us , and it can .
hey ! what are you two doing ?
what are you doing ?
no !
you are not gonna remember what i did to you
or what you saw me become .
we were just making out in the woods .
and then an animal attacked you
and bit your neck .
it &apos;s weird . it just came out of nowhere .
what are we going to do about tyler ?
i took care of it .
i &apos;ll get matt on vervain .
it &apos;ll keep you from being able to compel him , but ...
also keep you from being able to drink his blood .
i can &apos;t believe i hurt him .
i know .
he &apos;s the one person on this entire planet
that i never wanted to hurt .
it &apos;s not going to get any easier .
you &apos;re just going to have to work that much harder .
i shouldn &apos;t be with him , should i ?
and if there &apos;s any danger ...
i &apos;m the last person to make that kind of decision for you .
if i followed my own advice ,
i would have walked away from elena a long time ago .
you ever think you should off ?
i know i should off .
i just can &apos;t .
wanna toss me those ?
it was you .
matt , hey .
i can &apos;t believe an animal attacked you .
yeah . there have been a lot of animal attacks lately .
well , are you ok ?
i &apos;ve been better . how are you ?
i &apos;m ok . i &apos;m just-- i &apos;m worried about you .
i &apos;ll be fine .
ok .
seriously , amy ?
we were just talking ?
oh , is that what you call it ?
are you kidding me ?
no , i &apos;m not , matt .
she &apos;s into you . and anyone can see it .
look , i &apos;m sorry . i didn &apos;t mean--
i &apos;m just gonna go .
knock it off .
what are you doing ?
this isn &apos;t my fault , matt . ok . she &apos;s after you .
and i shouldn &apos;t have to put up with that .
i thought you said no more drama .
well , i lied .
just forget it .
just forget all of it .
so , what , are you , like , breaking up with me ?
yeah .
yeah . i guess that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
ric , i wasn &apos;t expecting you and elena till later .
i should have done that this morning .
road trips work well for us .
this doesn &apos;t mean that things are back
to the way they used to be , damon .
oh , come on .
i know i chipped a little bit off of your wall of hatred .
i need to know the truth .
when you broke jeremy &apos;s neck ,
did you know that he was wearing the ring ?
no .
no , i didn &apos;t .
katherine really pissed me off . and i snapped .
and ...
i got lucky with the ring .
and i don &apos;t know what i would have done if he wasn &apos;t wearing it .
elena , i &apos;m sorry .
thank you for being honest with me .
and the answer to your question about our friendship ...
is yes .
you have lost me forever .
you knew that already , didn &apos;t you ?
you used me today .
you had information about katherine that i needed to know .
i thought friends don &apos;t manipulate friends .
you and katherine have a lot more in common than just your looks .
elena ?
nope . try again .
katherine .
don &apos;t be frightened .
