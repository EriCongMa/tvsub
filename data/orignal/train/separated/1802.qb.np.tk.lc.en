&quot; love the one you &apos;re with &quot;
surgeons don &apos;t compromise .
derek shepherd--
multiple hand fractures with a median nerve injury .
arizona robbins-- open femur fracture
with resultant above @-@ knee amputation .
lexie grey-- deceased .
mark sloan-- deceased .
this doesn &apos;t include extreme ...
we defy death . we exceed perfection .
we operate for 17 hours straight if we have to .
... wish for me to extend their deepest condolences .
how is--how is the investigation going ?
have they found what caused the crash ?
the investigation could take years .
that &apos;s why we want to help you put this tragedy behind you .
i think you mean ,
your clients would like to put it behind them .
so i am authorized at this time
to propose a onetime settlement .
bayview aeronautics takes your loss seriously .
now the settlement agreement must be unanimous ,
and it releases bayview aeronautics
from any and all other claims , known or unknown ,
but ... most important ,
it will allow you to put this painful time behind you
and move on with your lives .
we aren &apos;t built to settle .
but that doesn &apos;t mean we won &apos;t .
wow .
yeah .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
and they need an answer in three days .
okay .
how have you been ?
okay .
you ?
i &apos;m fine .
good .
so , uh ...
you &apos;ll call me when you decide ?
yeah .
yeah .
should we settle ?
should we not settle ?
i don &apos;t know .
we should go to sleep .
do you want to keep the lights on or off tonight ?
on , please .
do you know what this money could mean for us ,
for sofia ?
i mean , she won &apos;t have to take out loans for med school .
we &apos;d be taken care of ...
you and me and sofia .
i think that &apos;s what mark would want .
you know what i want ... more than anything ?
i want to know what you &apos;re thinking ,
what you want .
just ...
okay , well , the home health care nurse will be here soon .
try to be nice .
don &apos;t throw things at this one , okay ?
just ...
let her help you .
okay . i &apos;ll see you tonight .
hey , alex ...
why did an intern just give me a compliment
on the crown moldings in my empty house ?
are you still sleeping there ?
chicks like it better than the on @-@ call room .
okay , that &apos;s disgusting .
now i have to have the place tented .
give me back my key .
you don &apos;t even live there anymore .
what do you care ?
key . please .
hey , you guys .
can you believe we &apos;re in the attendings &apos; lounge ?
april , what are you doing here ?
oh , uh , hunt came and got me on the farm in moline .
i was giving the pigs their breakfast ,
and i turn around , and there &apos;s dr. hunt , offering me my job back .
he didn &apos;t tell you guys ?
did anyone else see dr. hunt in the barnyard ?
when he appeared unto you , was he glowing at all ?
april ?
hunt hired her back .
we think .
it might have been jesus .
i thought you went to tulane .
uh , yeah . no , i @-@ i @-@ i changed my mind .
hey , you people are attendings .
you do not change clothes in front of everyone
like animals or interns ,
because nobody wants to see all that .
apparently kepner does .
what ?
n @-@ no , i d--i don &apos;t . i @-@ i wasn &apos;t e--i ...
gotta go .
me too . welcome back .
glad you back .
i am back ...
too .
i &apos;m a @-@ also glad
to be back .
okay .
morning , dr. bailey .
i cannot get used to having them in the attendings &apos; lounge .
well , i &apos;m still getting used to having you in here .
dr. yang--
famous and infamous .
come on in and take a load off .
you took a break .
i did .
some r &amp; r.
yes .
feels good , doesn &apos;t it ?
fantastic .
what &apos;d you see ?
i went to the mall of america . i road the roller coaster .
i purchased jeggings .
i &apos;m ready to get back to work .
you went on the internet and searched &quot; mall of america . &quot;
i am gonna be a team player . i mean it .
i heard what you said , sir .
then put on some scrubs , young lady .
thank you .
i saw you have a laser revascularization--
you &apos;ll be working with dr. thomas for now .
i &apos;ll believe team player when i see it , dr. yang .
i got your text . what do we got ?
16 @-@ year @-@ old kid , fished her out of the sound ,
sailing accident .
you mind ?
sorry .
why are you following me ?
i &apos;m your intern for the day .
oh . well , hello , intern . you have a name ?
jo wilson .
oh , nice . i like chicks with boys names .
karev .
what ? i do . it &apos;s hot .
stop sleeping with your coworkers . it ruins them .
i slept with you .
and now i no longer sleep with men .
roxie meyers , 30,
here for excess skin removal after a 100 @-@ pound weight loss
two years ago .
117 pounds .
frank .
i can &apos;t help it if i &apos;m proud of you .
and we &apos;ve set up a consult from general for the hernia repair ?
i did , yeah .
hey , i &apos;m it .
i am--i &apos;m your consult .
okay . hi .
uh , dr. kepner is going to repair your hernia .
so i &apos;ll just need to go over some incision points .
um , honey , could you ...
they want me to take off my robe .
roxie , this is a big operation .
i want to know everything that &apos;s gonna happen to you .
frank , please .
this is my fiancee ,
love of my life .
you guys do a good job , okay ?
of course .
i &apos;ll be right outside , babe .
okay .
all right .
okay .
now i &apos;m gonna start with some incisions here ...
and here .
the man &apos;s a saint .
we &apos;ve been together two years and we still haven &apos;t ...
you know , had sex .
i mean , when we cuddle , wh @-@ when he squeezes me here ,
it makes me cringe .
i just want to feel ... pretty .
you &apos;re already pretty .
you sound like frank .
do you have any questions for me before the surgery ?
just one . when ?
i &apos;m sorry ?
i think she wants to know when she and frank--
when can i jump his bones ?
your incisions will be healed in about two weeks .
so after that , you and frank
can be as physical as you like .
two weeks ? okay . wow .
i just got butterflies .
okay , emery , we &apos;re gonna need to take a look at your leg .
you and you , start cutting off the splint
so we can see what we &apos;ve got .
i can &apos;t feel my foot .
can you tell us what happened ?
yeah , this massive wave came up
and the mast , like , crushed my leg ,
and then--and then pickle just rolled over .
pickle ?
my boat . god , i can &apos;t believe i lost her .
why can &apos;t i feel my foot ?
okay , who else was on the boat with you ?
no one . i @-@ i &apos;m doing a solo sail from mexico to alaska .
oh , jeez .
oh , my god .
doppler . doppler .
is that ...
her tibia and fibula , i think .
what &apos;s wrong ?
everything &apos;s fine . just try to stay calm , okay ?
do you know where your parents are ?
i sailed here from mexico by myself .
i don &apos;t need you to wait for my parents .
tell me what &apos;s happening .
i &apos;m not getting a pulse .
okay , emery , i am so sorry ,
but we might not be able to save your foot , okay ?
no !
your injury &apos;s very severe .
it &apos;s mangled and there &apos;s no blood flow .
give her 5 of morphine !
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god .
she moved her toes with a nearly severed foot
so the tibial nerve &apos;s probably still intact , right ?
so , dr. torres , you think you can actually save the foot ?
well , when we get in there and do some nerve testing ,
we &apos;ll be able to assess the damage better .
i spoke to her parents . their flight gets in late tonight .
great . do you want to scrub in ?
hell , yeah .
all right .
this might take a while .
i need you to stay behind
and monitor my pre- and post @-@ ops .
but , um ...
i had hoped--since i was the one that saw the toes move ,
i &apos;d hoped that i--
but you need me to monitor your pre- and post @-@ ops .
got it . great .
you could &apos;ve let her scrub in or stand in the back and observe .
why ?
because she has joy .
i like joy , excitement , happiness .
people looking at me like i know things .
she practically squealed when i mentioned nerve testing .
there needs to be more squealing .
i can squeal if you want me to .
that sounds dirty and inappropriate .
oh , which i hear is your specialty these days .
i brought a tater tot hot dish .
you didn &apos;t ?
rina also brought tater tot hot dish .
it &apos;s pop pop &apos;s favorite .
oh , i know it is , love . that &apos;s why i brought it .
okay , you know pop pop has an enlarged heart .
so he can &apos;t be having
a tater tot hot dish .
not even a bite ? ohh .
it &apos;s his last meal .
no , you get a last meal before they kill you .
we &apos;re not planning on doing that .
dr. yang .
oh , hi , dr. thomas .
never show up in mr. patel &apos;s room during visiting hours .
oh , now you tell me .
are you still planning on doing
the ventricular reduction surgery ?
yes , i spoke to him about it this morning .
wouldn &apos;t an l @-@ vad be in order ?
an l @-@ vad is a band @-@ aid .
ventricular reduction is a repair .
you &apos;ll be hacking off working heart muscle .
so that what &apos;s left can work more efficiently .
this is an extremely high @-@ risk procedure when there &apos;s a simple fix .
people die from this surgery .
not when i do it , they don &apos;t .
how does such a tiny human make such a big mess ?
should we settle ?
it &apos;s a lot of money .
we could stop work , travel for a while ,
show zola the world .
zola wants to see the park
and the pond and the turtle that lives in the pond .
okay , so we don &apos;t settle .
not settling means what , years of litigation
and thousands of dollars looking for answers ?
and it &apos;s not gonna bring mark or lexie back .
traveling the world sounds better .
yeah , it does .
hey
what ?
so you realize , zola &apos;s sleeping ...
and all we &apos;re doing is talking ?
oh , you &apos;re right .
i can do that--something about that right now .
let me get that little . ooh , what is this ?
there &apos;s a block under my-- okay .
shh . don &apos;t wake her up . be quiet .
okay . shh .
uh , we ...
we should agree on the positioning
for the incisions for our surgery
so that i can have good visibility for the hernia .
yeah . um ...
i &apos;m gonna go in here and then here .
great . good . okay .
that looks good .
good .
so you staying here or a hotel ?
what &apos;s going on ?
oh , yes .
here un @-@ until i find a place .
i didn &apos;t call you , april , because i didn &apos;t--
i &apos;m revirginizing .
um , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a thing ,
revirginizing .
it involves a lot of prayer ,
which i had time to do in moline ,
staring at the &apos; n sync posters on my wall ,
which kind of makes me think of jesus as justin timberlake ,
but my pastor says that &apos;s totally fine ,
you know , as long as i &apos;m still talking to him ,
keeping the lines of communication open .
okay , april , you--
it &apos;s my second chance , jackson .
and i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d get one ,
but then dr . hunt showed up in moline
and offered my job back ,
and that was my sign
that i get to recommit myself to god .
i @-@ i can accept his forgiveness
and--and have a second chance .
a do @-@ over , you know , without all the mistakes ,
just slate wiped clean .
i am--
revirginizing .
yes .
which is really your way of saying
that you want to pretend that you and i never happened .
no , that is not ...
it &apos;s--it &apos;s--it &apos;s not that simple .
okay . that &apos;ll do it . thank you .
thank you , doctor .
dr. yang .
how is the great surgeon from seattle on this fine day ?
great .
you can &apos;t fool me .
i am a reader of faces , and your face tells me--
this is one of the finest cardiothoracic centers in the country .
i came here to do innovative , cutting @-@ edge surgeries with you
not ventricular reductions with thomas
is what my face tells you .
look , everybody has to take a shift .
babysit the old man .
put your time in , and i &apos;ll see to it ...
that you join me in the o.r. very soon .
on something good ?
well , i &apos;m consulting on a guy with mitral regurg .
oh , are you doing a mitral annuloplasty ?
probably .
and i &apos;ll relocate the tip of the posterior papillary muscle .
are you serious ?
as a heart attack .
cardio humor .
oh , yes , sir .
i am laughing , just not externally .
let me see a smile then .
no , let me see the great dr. yang
turn her frown upside down .
better .
i hope you won &apos;t be offended if i tell you
that you have a very nice smile .
look at this !
kepner is doing an umbilical hernia .
her first week back .
she failed her boards .
she was fired , twice .
the closest that girl has been to an o.r. in months
is what , the moline large animal vet ?
her head is not in the game .
she has ... other things on her mind ,
things i don &apos;t even want to think about .
so ... what , you &apos;re gonna pull her off the surgery ,
do it yourself ?
oh , don &apos;t be ridiculous .
i &apos;m getting her a babysitter .
hey , cristina .
april &apos;s back .
uh , yeah , i heard .
owen went to a pig farm ?
oh , so you &apos;re talking to owen ?
yeah , about the settlement .
hey , what &apos;s up , yang ?
i &apos;m about to be accomplice to a murder .
i always knew you &apos;d find your specialty .
what are you ...
actually , i know ,
let &apos;s pretend this never happened .
what ?
oh , show me . show me .
dr. bailey , all respect ,
but i can handle a hernia repair on my own .
well , you &apos;ve been working with pigs .
maybe she &apos;s worried you &apos;ll slaughter someone out of habit .
so have you thought about the settlement ?
what do you want to do ?
oh ... i don &apos;t know .
whatever everybody else wants to do .
i &apos;m a team player , mer .
apparently , so am i.
we were able to restore blood flow to your daughter &apos;s foot .
so it looks like we &apos;re gonna be able to save it .
it &apos;ll be a long , hard process , but she &apos;s tough .
she sure is .
oh , you have no idea .
mom , look .
oh , that &apos;s a beautiful boat , but--
yeah , they want to donate it
&apos;cause they heard about the accident .
i think we need to wait and hear what dr. torres has to say .
no , if i get back out there within the next two weeks ,
i can still make it before the weather gets really bad .
oh , i could just amputate your foot ,
and you could be up and out of here in a week .
or i could get you close to full function back ,
but it means a series of pretty big operations
over a few months ,
and you have to stay off the foot completely .
fine . let &apos;s do it .
actually , you guys have to give consent .
well , is ...
just say you consent .
yeah .
i brought you a coffee .
oh , wow . thanks .
you have a nice smile .
thanks .
and , uh ... just beautiful ...
eyes .
you know , if you want to drab--
grab a drink later or ...
i know this mexican place--
okay , okay , okay , you &apos;re flirting with me ,
which is really sweet or would be really sweet
if you were into ladies ,
but i &apos;m guessing that you &apos;re not a lady lover ,
&apos;cause you also look terrified that i might say yes .
you &apos;re poking a bear ,
a very horny bear .
and what would you do if the bear said yes ?
and there you &apos;d be ,
trading sexual favors for ...
i don &apos;t know what it is you want from me , so ...
you &apos;re gonna have to tell me .
i was wondering if it would be possible
to scrub in on your next surgery .
okay , &quot; a , &quot; never trade sex for scrubbing in
because that &apos;s just skanky .
save it for actually getting to cut .
and &quot; b , &quot; you &apos;re giving coffee to the wrong person .
oh , alex .
your intern brought you coffee .
oh , cool .
i was wondering if it would be possible
to scrub in on your next surgery .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
but hey , grab me another coffee . that was great .
go .
shoot . this defect &apos;s too big .
i &apos;m gonna need some mesh . suction .
here &apos;s an idea-- let &apos;s just pretend
that the patient never even had a hernia ,
then you wouldn &apos;t have to do anything .
would you stop ? this is not a joke to me .
no , you said you &apos;re pretending that--
what are we talking about ?
if you would just listen .
i &apos;m not pretending it never happened .
what never happened ?
it happened . i know it happened .
could someone just please--
but now i am wiping the slate clean .
by acting like it never happened .
no !
what never happened ?
nothing !
i ...
my ...
god .
oh , derek .
you--you doing a consult ?
no , actually , i have a question for you .
do you remember the donna drake case ?
about six years ago , mother of twin girls .
remember it ? i can &apos;t ever forget it .
i won &apos;t ever forget it .
how much did the hospital end up settling with the family ?
whoa . wow . it was a lot .
uh , i can check the exact amount ,
but it was definitely the largest settlement that i can remember .
because it was our fault that , uh , she died .
it &apos;s pretty standard .
the bigger the mistake , the bigger the payout .
oh , they offering you a pretty big settlement ?
yeah .
yeah , they are .
so you &apos;ll meet with everyone else tomorrow ,
see what they want to do , and that &apos;s that , i guess .
i mean , um ...
i guess i @-@ i @-@ i want to go with what everyone else decides .
okay .
oh , there is this woman with , like , the most
nasal voice you &apos;ve ever heard of .
she does the code calls here .
they &apos;re unintelligible .
i mean , everyone understands &apos; em , but to me ,
it &apos;s like a foreign language .
that &apos;s funny .
oh , yeah . you got-- you got hear it .
sure .
you know what ? oh , just wait . it &apos;ll happen any second .
okay .
she was a virgin .
i know that .
you defiled a virgin .
stop hitting my head . i sw--
i will go full crazy on you . all right ?
i am a grown ass man . she &apos;s a grown woman .
yeah , but she &apos;s--
she &apos;s what , april kepner ?
believe me , she is grown .
i didn &apos;t manipulate her .
i didn &apos;t defile her or trick her .
i didn &apos;t take her virginity .
she ... she gave it to me .
all right ? this isn &apos;t about something i did to her .
this is something we did together ,
and she can &apos;t handle that .
so she is praying ...
to justin timberlake , apparently .
and i &apos;m pissed . and ... it &apos;s a mess .
so just stop hitting my head .
so alex is a diseased man @-@ whore again ...
and april kepner is no longer a virgin .
wow . i missed a lot with that plane crash .
yeah , you missed a whole lot .
the chief banged my mom .
what ? the ...
owen banged--
webber . webber . dr. webber banged my mom .
oh , my god .
yeah , i know .
well ... if it makes you feel any better ,
he banged my mom , too .
that makes me feel worse .
just let her come down here for a little while .
did you check the i &apos;s and o &apos;s on 31 @-@ 50 ?
i did this morning .
she doesn &apos;t stop crapping and peeing
just because you want to watch a surgery .
go and check them again .
what is your problem ?
my problem is , i have 40 patients on my service .
the new peds attending is an idiot ,
and i need help .
so until your wife comes back to the hospital ,
i need my interns to actually work .
my wife is disabled .
my daughter &apos;s father is dead .
there &apos;s nothing we can do about that ,
but this money will pay for arizona &apos;s rehab .
it would take care of our little girl ,
mark &apos;s little girl .
this is a huge amount of money .
it &apos;s a life @-@ changing amount of money .
all right , so you &apos;re saying we take it .
i &apos;m just saying ,
you don &apos;t walk away from a number like this , right ?
well , i &apos;m still talking to cristina ,
but i think she &apos;d want to take it , yeah .
mer ?
yeah . i mean , i guess , yeah .
derek , what do you think ? it has to be unanimous .
what do you say ?
i say , we have until tomorrow .
i googled you .
i know how to do it even though i &apos;m old .
i know what googling is .
i googled you , and it said that you were in a plane crash .
am i talking to myself ?
i would rather talk about the medicine .
okay .
notice how i close without using felt pledgets . hmm ?
you impressed ? i know you are .
you &apos;re just too prideful to admit it ,
but that &apos;s okay .
it comes together impeccably .
i didn &apos;t think that was possible .
i mean , i &apos;ve tried to suture myocardium before
without synthetic patches and couldn &apos;t get it to hold .
yes , well , the trick is
to use a double layer of zero vicryl .
it &apos;s my signature .
i &apos;m the only one in the country who can do it
because i &apos;ve devoted my life to doing it .
i don &apos;t go home to family
and , uh , chitchat .
i go to bed
thinking about this technique .
so ...
what is your signature move , hmm ?
oh , i @-@ i don &apos;t--
life is short , you know ?
you &apos;ve seen that yourself .
so you better get at it .
there it is .
now if you had put in your beloved l @-@ vad ,
he would &apos;ve died waiting for a heart transplant ,
which would never happen .
this way , bo bo has a chance at life .
pop pop .
what ? speak up .
uh , nothing , sir .
the settlement meeting is at 8 : 00 tomorrow night .
are you gonna go ?
you &apos;re going , so i don &apos;t have to .
see how that works ?
i &apos;m going to speak for mark , who can &apos;t speak for himself .
see how that works ?
you should be at that meeting .
you should speak for yourself . i @-@ i wasn &apos;t there .
i--it &apos;s not a decision i should be making for you .
you weren &apos;t shy about making other decisions for me .
what &apos;s different now ?
i mean , i think you &apos;re on a roll .
i can &apos;t do this .
say it , &apos; cause it was perfect .
&quot; it &apos;s not a decision that i should be making for you . &quot;
say it .
stop .
say it again .
&quot; it &apos;s not a decision that i should be making for you !
&quot; as opposed to hacking off a limb--
that &apos;s the kind of decision i should make for you . &quot;
fine . don &apos;t go . i will make all the decisions .
just so you know ,
i &apos;m gonna vote to take the settlement for sofia ,
because mark would want her to have the money .
i think mark would want you
to pick up your daughter when she &apos;s crying .
i guess he &apos;s gonna have to deal with disappointment ,
just like the rest of us .
mer , we chopped up this heart , and it was amazing .
i mean , you should see how this guy handles myocardium .
are you sleeping with him ?
what ? no . he &apos;s like 100 .
you know who did sleep together ? april and jackson .
no way . kepner did it ?
she did it .
finally .
except she &apos;s not doing it again .
what do you mean ?
clean slate . she &apos;s revirginizing .
oh , please .
no , she &apos;s there , he &apos;s there .
all she has to do is hear his voice ,
and she &apos;s not gonna be able to think straight .
all right , now keep in mind ,
there &apos;s still a lot of swelling and bruising .
it &apos;s okay , roxie .
it &apos;s more than okay . it &apos;s ...
there &apos;s nothing to squeeze .
hey , rox , the cafeteria was out of lemonade ,
so i got you--oh .
oh , sorry .
i &apos;m sorry . i gotta ... go . excuse me .
dr. karev , i &apos;ve rounded on your pre @-@ ops , your post @-@ ops .
i &apos;ve run your labs ,
and i &apos;m updating your charts right now .
what about my consult on the j.r.a. kid ?
you schedule that yet ?
um , no , i @-@ i haven &apos;t had a chance to--
you kidding me ?
stop with the charting . do it now .
or don &apos;t .
no , i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll schedule it .
god , i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m crying in front of my boss .
i told myself that i wouldn &apos;t do this .
look , i &apos;m not supposed to be this person .
i don &apos;t fail .
i was valedictorian of my high school ,
graduated cum laude from princeton .
i was first in my class at harvard .
how am i not getting this ?
i &apos;ve somehow become the loser intern .
i @-@ i blew the appy with dr. grey .
you &apos;ve been piling on the scut ,
so clearly i pissed you off somehow .
you get scut because you &apos;re an intern .
that &apos;s what interns do . it &apos;s the best way to learn .
and ... you haven &apos;t pissed me off .
i haven &apos;t ?
no , i &apos;m just ...
dr. torres may have told me not to ...
flirt with you .
because it may be possible
that i dated a couple of other interns .
you mean heather .
yeah , her .
and leah .
and susan , stacey , tina , irene .
don &apos;t worry about the flirting ,
i have absolutely no interest in you ,
since you &apos;ve already screwed every one of my friends .
i should go .
8 : 00 a.m. tomorrow , i &apos;m doing a nissen .
don &apos;t be late .
mrs. james ,
i just checked on emery . she &apos;s doing great .
and she promised to , uh , take it easy before her follow @-@ up .
she &apos;s lying .
a sailing company donated a new boat , and she took it .
she &apos;s going back out there as soon as you let her out of here .
what ?
she &apos;s always been like this , headstrong , independent--
okay , if she goes out there before this is healed properly ,
she &apos;ll lose that foot .
maybe you could keep her here ,
say that she has to stay here while she recuperates .
i can &apos;t keep her here without medical necessity .
if we stop her from sailing , she will hate us .
so let her .
stop being scared of your own daughter .
she &apos;s 16 . she named a boat &quot; pickle . &quot;
she &apos;s a little girl .
be her parent .
she needs you to be the bad guy .
i could get in a lot of trouble for this .
the plane &apos;s aft broke away from the main cabin .
the tail was recovered in , uh , zone one .
that &apos;s a keel beam .
it was recovered in zone two ,
about half a mile away .
and that &apos;s the r @-@ 3 cabin door .
what happens to all this ?
what happens if we settle ?
i--i &apos;m s @-@ sorry i ran off like that . i just ...
so i am not gonna pretend it didn &apos;t happen .
i can &apos;t do that .
i know . i , um , me either .
i c--i can &apos;t stop thinking about it .
the more i think about it , the more--
the more i try not to think about it ,
i &apos;m thinking about it , so--
yeah , i know .
i know .
do you want to get married ?
uh , what ?
because if you &apos;re serious about this whole revirginizing thing ,
that means that the next guy that you sleep with
is probably gonna be your husband .
right ? that &apos;s what you want .
and i am not ready to be anybody &apos;s husband .
and i really don &apos;t think you &apos;re ready to be anybody &apos;s wife .
so let &apos;s remember that it happened ,
make sure it doesn &apos;t happen again .
unless we want it to ,
unless we are ...
ready .
i &apos;m , um , i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t be near you or i might ...
me too .
okay , so we , um--
we stay away from each other ...
for--for a while .
okay .
um , so i &apos;m just gonna ...
walk away now .
bye .
oh , god .
it is a horror movie inside this microwave ,
a horror movie .
oh , they are ... entitled , ungrateful children ,
and they should know better .
not that i care .
i don &apos;t care . i &apos;m done caring .
okay , so what &apos;s really going on ?
tuck let go of my hand .
uh , what ?
tuck-- he let go of my hand .
i took him to his first day of kindergarten ,
and i was , you know , ready for the tears and the good @-@ bye ,
and how hard it was gonna be .
and he just let go of my hand .
he didn &apos;t even look back .
he walked in , saw a toy he liked ,
and didn &apos;t look back .
i called his dad .
he was ... busy .
he &apos;s getting married again ,
which is very nice , i @-@ i like her .
whatever . he was busy .
so i called ben ,
and he was studying up to observe his first laparoscopic surgery .
he was so excited--
everybody &apos;s moving on .
and i &apos;m here , doing appys and choles ,
&apos;cause what a general surgery attending does ,
appys and choles .
while everybody else is off conquering new things ,
i &apos;m stuck .
and i didn &apos;t care . you know , i mean , this was my choice .
i &apos;m not even sure i noticed ...
until tuck let go of your hand .
till tuck let go of my hand .
you know what happens when someone lets go of your hand ?
what ?
you get it back .
it &apos;s a good thing .
you know , interns let go ,
and ... tuck let go ,
and even ben let go .
and they &apos;re all still there .
they all still love you .
but it means you get your hand back .
it means you have time--
not to wash the dishes ...
to do something with ,
to get out there ,
to find diseases to cure ,
to take it to the next level .
hell , it means invent the bailey method .
but you gotta get out there , do something .
and don &apos;t look back .
yeah , we &apos;re meeting in an hour about the settlement .
have you decided ?
no , i don &apos;t care .
so ... do you want to think about it some more or ...
no , no , i just ...
oh , settle or ... or don &apos;t settle .
it ... it doesn &apos;t matter .
you know , whatever the group wants to do is fine with me .
okay .
i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll call you and i &apos;ll let you know .
no , no , don &apos;t . i mean , just send me a check .
or , you know , i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll get the ... the lawyers to call .
okay .
we can &apos;t keep doing this .
i know .
i &apos;m here now .
i know .
so ...
bye .
bye .
arizona , i &apos;ve come to get you .
you &apos;re going to this meeting . it starts in 20 minutes .
arizona ?
where are you ?
oh , my ... are you okay ?
where &apos;s the nurse ?
i d ... i didn &apos;t like her . so i fired her .
oh , great .
great . that &apos;s just great .
why are you ...
i thought ...
that i could get to the toilet on time by myself .
apparently , i was wrong .
did you fall ? are ... are you okay ?
do i look okay ?
i am sitting in a pool of my own urine .
i &apos;m putting you in the shower .
no , just get out !
hey !
do not talk to me that way .
please ! please get out !
arizona .
did you hear me ? you did this !
i can &apos;t even pee by myself !
yeah , and it &apos;s a problem because you now stink !
this bathroom stinks !
get off of me !
i am not sharing my home with anybody who smells like this !
get off of me ! get off of me !
get off of me !
i have nowhere else to go !
this is my life now , too !
you know , i was , too .
in a plane crash .
in vietnam .
everyone on board the plane died
but me .
i never ,
i never have told anybody about that around here .
you know , it &apos;s ...
would you like a smoke ?
oh , i don &apos;t smoke .
me neither .
not anymore .
i mean , these things could kill you , you know ?
what ?
well , you know ...
it seems like ...
everything kills you these days .
yeah .
yeah .
sorry .
so we &apos;ve all agreed and we ...
no . wait .
we can &apos;t do this .
i saw the plane .
i went to the hangar and i saw the ...
pieces of our plane
laid out on the floor like a jigsaw puzzle .
if we agree to settle , they do the investigation ,
and we can &apos;t do anything with the results .
bayview aeronautics will take the results and act accordingly .
oh , i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be very thorough .
big companies are always very good about self @-@ policing .
mistakes happen , derek . accidents happen .
we make mistakes that can cost lives , too .
yes , we do .
but when we do , we have m &amp; ms.
we pore over the files .
we make sure it never happens again .
and we try to make sure
future patients never have to go through that grief .
they don &apos;t have to sleep with the lights on every night
because the darkness is too much .
we just can &apos;t stand by and let this happen
to other people &apos;s ...
lexies and marks .
we have to do something about it .
we have to make this right .
if i could interject for a moment ...
be quiet .
your decision does have to be unanimous .
she said , be quiet .
callie ...
what are you thinking ?
my advice at this time ...
shut up .
you &apos;re not one of us .
you don &apos;t know . you have no idea what we &apos;ve been ...
derek &apos;s right . we shouldn &apos;t take the money .
we can &apos;t take it .
when we follow our hearts ,
when we choose not to settle ,
it &apos;s funny , isn &apos;t it ?
a weight lifts ...
the sun shines a little brighter ...
and , for a brief moment at least ...
