go ! go ! go !
so , ross , how was your date the other night ?
did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with every flush ?
laugh all you want , but she said she &apos;d like to go out again .
in fact , i &apos;ll go call her right now .
and i &apos;ll make sure and tell her my friend chandler says ...
sorry i didn &apos;t stop by last night , but i had a date .
when it &apos;s 1 : 00 in the morning and you don &apos;t come by , that &apos;s okay .
it was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street .
really ? right across the street ?
yeah .
when did you meet her ?
two days ago .
excellent !
you know , ross met somebody too .
hey .
how &apos;d it go ?
great . we &apos;re going out again saturday .
but i just found out she &apos;s also seeing some other guy .
really ?
joe , what would you do if you were in ross &apos; situation ?
i sort of am . i &apos;m dating this girl who &apos;s also seeing another guy .
but i &apos;m not worried about it .
you shouldn &apos;t be . i wouldn &apos;t want to be the guy who &apos;s up against you .
i mean , that doofus is going to lose .
so this is nice .
i wish i didn &apos;t have to go . believe me .
but i have to .
by the way , what &apos;s the name of the girl you &apos;re dating ?
kristen leigh .
bye .
well , obviously only one of us can keep dating her .
obviously . so how do we decide ?
well , now , let &apos;s look at this objectively .
i think i should date her .
or i &apos;m the one who dates her .
that &apos;s interesting . but check this out . i date her .
okay , but to go in another direction ...
okay . this can go on for a while .
we should order some food , then .
no , joey .
look , why don &apos;t we just let her decide , okay ?
we &apos;ll each go out with her one more time .
and we &apos;ll see who she likes best .
that sounds fair .
maybe i &apos;ll take her to that new french restaurant .
wait a second . we have to set a spending limit on the date .
i don &apos;t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that .
well , sorry . that &apos;s what i do on dates .
well , i guess i &apos;ll just have to do what i do on dates .
so let &apos;s decide on a spending limit .
yeah .
and a slice ...
... $ 6 ?
i was thinking more like 100 .
okay .
can i borrow $ 94 ?
i know . can you hand me a tissue ?
you &apos;re out of diet coke .
hello ?
what ? you what ?
you listen here , missy !
that was megan . she booked the swing kings on the day of our wedding ...
... and said i couldn &apos;t have them back unless i gave her the dress !
does that mean carcass is available ?
what am i gonna do ? that &apos;s the dress ! that is the dress !
chandler wants the band . what do i do ?
figure out a way to talk him out of it .
how ?
you &apos;re out of toilet paper !
i wanted to wish you good luck on your date .
thanks .
what time are you meeting ?
we have 8 : 00 reservations at grand merci bistro .
that &apos;s in 20 minutes . you &apos;d better get dressed .
i am dressed .
oh , well , good .
for me .
what &apos;s this ? did you give yourself a facial ?
i have an oily t @-@ zone .
okay , dude .
you sent kristen flowers ?
that &apos;s right .
you spent $ 100 . that &apos;s the limit . you &apos;re screwed !
i sent the flowers before the actual date , so technically ...
... i didn &apos;t break any rules .
thanks for stopping by , though .
that &apos;s the way it &apos;s gonna be ?
i can break the rules too .
what are you gonna do ?
i don &apos;t know .
why am i not surprised ?
not gonna let you get away with this .
i don &apos;t think you have much choice .
we &apos;ll see !
hey ! so , just a light layer ?
yeah , just here and there .
joey got meat sauce on the banister again .
swing music is so out .
he &apos;s gotta be in the room for that to work .
what are you guys talking about ?
we &apos;re talking about the swing kings ...
... and wondering whether they &apos;re the right way to go .
i went to a wedding once where they had swing music ...
... and two months later , the couple divorced .
i &apos;m not saying there &apos;s any connection here ...
... but they did tell me that &apos;s why they got divorced .
but i love swing music !
but the swing kings ?
they suck so much that people die at their concerts . they just stop living .
all i know is that when monica and i went to see them , we had fun .
and there &apos;s another reason .
well , what is the other reason ?
i don &apos;t want to say .
well , you have to because maybe it &apos;s stupid .
it &apos;s just , while monica and i were dancing to them ...
... it was the first time i knew that ...
... you were the woman that i wanted to dance all my dances with .
oh , crap .
our table will be ready in a few minutes .
oh , great .
is your back feeling better ?
yeah , that &apos;s fine .
i guess the more muscles you have ...
... the more they can spasm out of control .
kristen ?
joey !
what are you doing here ?
i like this place .
and technically , i &apos;m not breaking any rules , so ...
well , ross , this is joey . joey , ross .
hi .
hi . it &apos;s nice to meet you .
i used to have a friend named joey .
i don &apos;t anymore .
our table will be ready in a couple minutes .
sure , i would love to wait with you guys ! thanks !
so , joey , you look familiar .
are you on tv or something ?
joey doesn &apos;t like to talk about it ...
... but he &apos;s one of the stars of days of our lives .
that &apos;s right . don &apos;t you play a woman ?
a woman in a man &apos;s body .
much better .
it &apos;s funny , because you look familiar to me too .
have you ever been married ?
yes , i have .
in fact , just the other day ...
... kris and i were talking about how i &apos;ve been married and how i have a son .
little eric .
that &apos;s right . wait . no , ben .
so you &apos;ve just been married the one time , then ?
well ...
you &apos;ve been married twice ?
yes . and ...
... another time after that .
boy , i &apos;m getting hungry .
have you ever been so hungry on a date ...
... that when the girl goes to the bathroom , you eat her food ?
you said the waiter ate my crab cake .
so , ross , now why did that first marriage break up ?
was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian ?
do you two know each other ?
no .
just seems like ross is the kind of guy who &apos;d marry a woman ...
... on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge .
wait a minute ! were you on a poster for gonorrhea ?
have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey ?
you leave marcel out of this !
fine ! you ever gotten stuck in a pair of your own leather pants ?
have you ever locked yourself in a tv cabinet , vd @-@ boy ?
monkey @-@ lover !
where do you think we lost her ?
probably around gonorrhea .
geller , table of two ?
you hungry ?
does a bear shit in the woods ?
hi , honey , i &apos;m home !
don &apos;t come in here !
why , do you have another boyfriend in there ?
no . we only mess around at his place .
i started it , but now it &apos;s scaring me , so could you come out here , please ?
no , i &apos;m wearing a wedding dress .
you got a wedding dress ?
yeah , but i &apos;m not keeping it .
then why can &apos;t i see it ?
oh . i guess you can .
but i have to return it , so you can &apos;t like it .
okay , i promise . i &apos;ll hate it .
wow . you look hideous .
really ?
yeah . that &apos;s like the most ugliest dress i &apos;ve ever seen .
why do you have to return it ?
because it doesn &apos;t really fit .
oh , by the way , i booked the swing kings .
oh , that &apos;s great . thanks .
but that dress is terrible .
it makes me want to rip it off you .
okay .
but you can &apos;t rip it .
well , maybe a little .
guys , you want to look at the song list for the wedding ?
guys ?
i thought you were gonna be gone all day .
all right , what &apos;s going on ?
i &apos;m sorry . i should probably leave you girls alone .
laugh all you want , but in 10 minutes , we &apos;ll have younger @-@ looking skin .
you know , she could use a little ...
