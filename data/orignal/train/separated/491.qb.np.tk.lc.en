it &apos;s like i told you .
i &apos;ve always been into pretty things ,
so , it makes sense that i &apos;d be into girls , right ?
that ... is ... hot .
no , i can &apos;t do that .
we &apos;ll go in back . no one will see .
no .
no until you show me . we had a deal .
all right , then , pretty thing .
let &apos;s do this .
i &apos;m not gonna bite .
unless you want me to .
come on in . i want to show you .
you don &apos;t trust me .
oh , come on . you can &apos;t blame me .
a girl &apos;s gotta be careful these days .
yeah , well , everybody does .
remind me again why i should trust you .
well , for starters , you &apos;ve known me 3 months .
sort of .
tonight &apos;s our first face to face .
seriously ? i mean , all of those hours online ,
they don &apos;t mean anything ?
come on .
i &apos;m trusting you .
with my life .
you took these yourself ?
every last one .
and you named them .
ashley ...
becca ...
when are you gonna let me take your picture ?
uh , i &apos;ve outgrown what you &apos;re into , don &apos;t you think ?
maybe just a little .
no . i bet you put on that outfit right there ,
you &apos;ll look 15 all over again .
ok .
are you ready ?
oh , yes .
i wasn &apos;t talking to you .
what ? who the hell is this ? !
you bitch ! you set me up !
you know what amazes me , mark ?
is that total losers just like you ,
complete cowards who prey on children ,
they fall for this every single time .
you &apos;re under arrest for child endangerment
and the distribution of child pornography .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be ...
sorry . hi .
good morning . which floor ?
uh , 6 , pl-- hmm , you , too .
karaoke at the benjamin .
excuse me ?
you were singing karaoke at the benjamin the night it closed .
i was . good memory .
billy joel might have died a little that night .
sadly , he was not the only one .
he got us started , but we went on to do a 6 @-@ song set .
the eighties took a fatal hit , if i remember correctly .
have you seen the place that took over ?
it &apos;s like techno and twerking .
it &apos;s not really my crowd .
what ?
you don &apos;t twerk ?
i was--i was kidding .
i don &apos;t twerk .
ah . a gentleman and a scholar .
agent hotchner &apos;s office is the first
one at the top of the stairs .
thanks .
good luck .
well , how &apos;d you do last night ?
3 hours again .
baby girl , you can &apos;t function on 3 hours of sleep .
trust me , i &apos;ve tried .
i know , but it &apos;s better than the nightmares .
there &apos;s gotta be something you can do .
i &apos;ve tried everything , trust me .
have you tried not drinking coffee ?
this is tea . it &apos;s herbal , no caffeine . what else you got ?
better be a good answer .
yeah , that &apos;s what i thought .
i know . it surprised me , too .
what ? what surprised you ?
hotch talked to emily .
and ?
she just doesn &apos;t want to come back .
why ? she loves us .
for what it &apos;s worth , hotch is interviewing
someone we &apos;ve met before .
he is ?
how many candidates is that now ?
this one makes lucky number 10 .
what ? see , this is what happens when i don &apos;t sleep .
i miss things . who is this person ?
are they nice ? why is that the first question i always ask ?
the , uh , piles of files aren &apos;t usually this high .
our section chief is overseas and we &apos;re down an agent .
i heard that ssa blake transferred to boston .
she decided to teach full @-@ time .
that &apos;s ... noble . good for her .
i am not ready for that .
no , i &apos;m not either .
you have an impressive success rating ,
and your supervisor speaks very highly of you .
i think you &apos;ll be a valuable asset to the team .
really ?
that &apos;s it ? i &apos;ve only been in here two minutes .
there &apos;s no song and dance ?
i mean , i had a whole thing prepared .
i don &apos;t know if you know this ,
but there is a band outside your door .
your 8 years with the bureau
and your undercover work convinced me that you &apos;ll fit right in .
any questions ?
sometimes it takes me 2 or 3 months to arrest one offender .
you catch a new one every week .
how do you not take it with you ?
i know , i &apos;m interrupting .
garcia , this is agent kate callahan .
she &apos;ll be joining the team .
hello . i know you .
he &apos;s at it again in bakersfield .
i &apos;ll be right there .
that &apos;s the third victim .
we &apos;ve been consulting .
but you haven &apos;t made the trip to california ?
we &apos;re about to . you have a go bag ?
i am like a boy scout , sir . always prepared .
good to hear .
everyone , this is ssa kate callahan
from andy swan &apos;s unit . she &apos;ll be joining the team .
hi .
congratulations .
thanks .
how are andy and seaver doing ?
oh , they &apos;re great and they say hello .
welcome , welcome .
we can get started .
yes , we can .
the mad butcher of bakersfield
has left another torso in the desert .
this brings the body count to 3 this month
and still none of them have been identified .
at this pace he &apos;s going for a record .
yeah , and quite the imagery . what &apos;s he trying to say ?
a torso by itself has no life .
right . it can &apos;t survive .
it might be how he sees himself .
it could also be a simple forensic countermeasure .
he dumps the torso after getting rid of all the pieces
that can identify his victims .
that would make sense for someone who &apos;s criminally sophisticated ,
but this guy &apos;s leaving his dna all over the torsos .
well , we &apos;ve kept tabs in codis . he &apos;s not in any system .
but it &apos;s still a risk for him and taunt to us .
hey , einstein .
you &apos;re awfully quiet .
i &apos;m just reading here the m.e. thinks
the victims were alive for 48 hours while he disarticulates .
that means the unsub &apos;s sexual gratification comes from cutting .
exactly . he wouldn &apos;t go to these extremes
if he were merely discarding the limbs .
he obviously enjoys the ritual .
it &apos;s some kind of torture .
so if it isn &apos;t about easy disposal ,
the limbs could be his trophies .
he &apos;d need preserving agents and isolation .
garcia , come up with a list of suppliers in southern california .
we &apos;ll cross that with a geographical profile when we have it .
keywords sodium dioxide and silicate .
you &apos;re the best . thank you .
tell them we &apos;re on our way .
yes , sir .
corey ! gonna be late .
coming , dad !
6 fundamental themes of geography . go .
location , place , human , environmental interactions ,
movement , and regions .
yeah , you got it .
have a great day , buddy .
thanks , dad .
&quot; i remained too much inside my head
and ended up losing my mind . &quot;
edgar allan poe .
&quot; the mad butcher . &quot;
100 bucks says we have the media to thank for that one .
this is los angeles . they make everything a spectacle .
i &apos;m sure he &apos;s getting off on it .
they always do .
he spared the second victim the mutilations ,
but the first and latest are covered .
there &apos;s no clear purpose . maybe he &apos;s experimenting .
or he &apos;s trying to remove something
that could identify those victims ,
like tattoos , birthmarks .
still hard to believe we can &apos;t i.d. a torso .
i mean , back in the day i &apos;d get it ,
but nowadays everyone might as well have a microchip .
cutting that first victim seems extreme .
i wonder if he &apos;s linked to him somehow .
none of the victims matched any missing persons reports
and were likely chosen
for their anonymity .
southern california &apos;s notorious for its transient community .
going after high @-@ risk victims makes sense for this guy .
i mean , there &apos;s nothing about him that &apos;s particularly unique .
except he first attacked a male
and then moved on to females .
that &apos;s strange , &apos; cause a fantasy this advanced
is usually specific to one type .
well , there was no dna left on this male victim .
so it isn &apos;t overtly sexual like his other victims .
so he &apos;s either a victim of opportunity or necessity .
3 victims in a month means he &apos;s got something to prove .
either to himself or the rest of us .
all right , when we land , morgan ,
you and reid go to the medical examiner .
dave and kate go to the latest disposal site .
and jj and i will get set up with lieutenant banks at the p.d.
no head , hands , prints , or dental records .
he &apos;s not making it easy .
what do you know about this victim ?
i haven &apos;t completed the internal exam yet ,
but if she &apos;s anything like the others ,
she &apos;ll have traces of some leather particulate in her stomach .
so maybe he gags them
with a belt as he tortures ?
he &apos;s definitely a sexual sadist .
that &apos;s my guess .
what i know for sure is she &apos;s got a good muscle tone
and even has tan lines from a sports bra ,
indicating she &apos;s active .
both females were in shape , not malnourished ?
no .
it &apos;s unlikely they were transients .
what do we know about the offender ?
he has a decent knowledge of the anatomy .
you think he has medical training ?
not necessarily . he could be a butcher or a hunter .
the first step in amputation is
ligating the supplying artery and vein ,
which the offender did .
well , that would make sense if he &apos;s trying
to keep them alive for the torture .
the next step would involve an oscillating saw ,
but he opted for a long @-@ angled blade .
and he &apos;s have to be pretty strong to make a clean cut like that .
absolutely .
and they &apos;re identical on each victim .
the decapitation was one swift ,
clean cut between the second and third vertebra .
no hesitation .
he &apos;s methodical . this is a mutilation .
he followed along like a surgeon would for breast augmentation .
she has scar tissue that looks about 5 years old .
he removed her implants
because he knew we could trace her via the serial number .
this guy &apos;s smarter than we thought .
you led the ludwig investigation in upstate new york .
nasty piece of work , that guy . you know the story ?
well , it was all over the news .
i saw the arrest .
he was all busted up , broken nose and everything .
yeah , well , that &apos;s what happens
when they trip over their feet , right ?
oh , yeah , i &apos;ve seen that happen before .
i know that case couldn &apos;t have been easy .
when you find one that is , let me know .
all the dump sites are pretty isolated ,
but this one takes the cake .
yeah , he could have buried the torso , but look .
he laid her right here .
maybe it &apos;s remorse ?
he tortures them for 48 hours ,
feels bad afterward , and then lays them to rest .
it doesn &apos;t sound much like a sadist , does it ?
it &apos;s not just that .
this guy is compulsive .
he can &apos;t shut it off . he &apos;s counting down the hours
until his next kill . so ...
what does he do to pass the time ?
he obsesses .
he &apos;s not disposing them .
he &apos;s displaying them .
it &apos;s part of his fantasy .
we need to set up surveillance at all the other sites .
he &apos;s revisiting .
the disposal sites are within 5 miles ,
but until we know the abduction sites ,
it &apos;s hard to know how big his comfort zone is .
transients , they tend to gather in that area .
嫌犯会重回犯罪现场
we &apos;re gonna need surveillance teams at each of the disposal sites .
what are we looking for ?
csi , they already scoured the place .
they didn &apos;t find a thing .
he could be coming back to relive the crimes .
it explains the dna on the torsos .
two @-@ man teams good enough ?
it works for us . thanks .
well , pretty boy here figured out how to i.d. the latest vic .
we had garcia match body type and weight
with local missing women who also had surgeries .
her name &apos;s kim eakle . she recently moved to california .
she &apos;s single . parents just reported her missing .
and where &apos;s she from ?
riverside . but we have no way of knowing
where or when she was taken .
this is all over the news . everyone &apos;s hyper @-@ vigilant .
you think he &apos;s got some kind of ruse to get her ?
more like he knocks her out .
nothing about this guy says charming .
garcia , where are we on the preservatives ?
who knew that southern california was a hub for silica gel ?
i &apos;ve got a dozen places shipping regularly to a few residences .
he needs isolation . do any of the residences have basements
or detached garages ?
no basements , but two have garages .
any of them single men ?
i wish that they were , then they &apos;d be doing
their silica weirdness family free .
both of them are married with children , actually .
all right , send the addresses .
yep , done .
corey , what are you doing in here ?
i just need to get a screwdriver
to get the batteries out of the remote .
well , i told you i would get it .
give me that .
jeez , sorry , dad .
look , you can &apos;t watch tv until you &apos;ve done your homework , anyway .
i finished .
go . be in in a minute .
what can i do for you , officers ?
agents .
callahan and rossi , fbi .
oh . my apologies .
you must have worked extra hard to get that badge .
we all did .
you buy large quantities of preservatives .
um ... is that a question ?
may we take a look at your supply ?
uh , why ? is there something that &apos;s tainted ?
no , sir .
is it a threat to me and my family ?
no .
well , then i &apos;m sorry .
but that is my private property ,
and for you to come into my home ,
you &apos;re gonna need a search warrant .
shoot , i knew we forgot something .
well , i have to help my son with his homework .
afternoon .
when we arrest that guy , do you mind if i do the honors ?
we might have to flip for it .
you &apos;re on private property ,
so we have probable cause to search your vehicle .
get out of the car .
we got one .
let &apos;s pop the trunk .
turn around and put your hands on your head .
hey , you can &apos;t go back there ! get away from there !
just keep quiet .
you have no right !
hotch .
is my wife here ?
yes .
my son ?
he &apos;s at home .
when his friends hear about this on the news ,
he &apos;ll have a lot of questions .
you enjoying this ?
not in the least .
because your whole approach seems callous to me .
ohh . you &apos;re a judger .
that is really something .
don &apos;t you just love that ?
what &apos;s with your hatred of women ?
i don &apos;t hate women .
so holding on to their limbs is something you do out of love ?
no . look , i love my family .
this has nothing to do with them .
you gonna tell your wife that ?
you found a leg in his car .
actually , we found 3 .
oh , my god .
has your husband been acting withdrawn lately ?
w @-@ we &apos;ve both been distant ,
but this is way more than that .
what the hell is it , some kind of fetish ?
it &apos;s called acrotomophilia .
it &apos;s a sexual arousal related to--
stop . i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t need to know any more .
did you ever suspect this ?
maybe before you were even married ?
i used to work in this retail store .
clothes , jewelry , that kind of thing .
there was a storage room in the back .
real small .
frank would wait for me there while i closed up .
this one time i went in the back , and he , um--
he was ... rubbing up against this mannequin .
its leg was gone .
i freaked out , but he said he was just trying to fix it .
i didn &apos;t believe him .
but i needed to . we were gonna get married . i ...
i was young .
i didn &apos;t even know wanting something like that could be a ...
thing .
it &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s your right to remain silent .
we &apos;ll just ... keep you company
until your transportation arrives .
you know , i &apos;ve been doing this a long time .
and the funny thing about it , behavioral science ,
is it &apos;s not exact like physics .
we get surprises all the time .
like him .
you know , i bet if we talked to all the neighbors ,
they &apos;d say the same thing .
friendly guy . maybe pick up on some of his insecurities .
a little too ... average .
but what none of the neighbors would see
is what a guy like him is like when no one is watching .
so desperate to be aggressive , dominant .
yeah , this one surprises me .
i mean , his fantasies were innocent enough .
managed them all these years .
what was it that made him snap and kill 3 people ?
wait .
you think i killed them ?
no . no , no , no . i just bought their limbs .
from who ?
i , uh--i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t know .
you &apos;re gonna have to do better than that .
so what did you do , just put out a classified ?
well , sort of .
there &apos;s this guy .
i found him in a chat room .
he finds whatever it is you &apos;re looking for .
and how do you get it ?
uh , it &apos;s in a different place every time .
uh , rest stops , abandoned places mainly .
i , uh , i &apos;d leave the cash ,
and he leaves what it is i paid for .
but you wouldn &apos;t drive off right away .
oh , no . i &apos;d want to be alone with it .
you never had a chance to meet him , not even once ?
never saw a strange car ?
no , no . no , never . i swear .
the whole thing sounds bizarre .
do you believe him ?
yes . fetishes aren &apos;t always violent .
he had a need for the limbs , but not a desire to kill .
then who are we looking for ?
single white male , 30 to 40 , living in isolation .
he seeks out solitude
because he was probably raised in an abusive home
and he &apos;s still looking for refuge .
chances are he lost his job recently ,
which is why he sold the body parts .
his lack of social skills point to menial work ,
but his sophistication tells us
he &apos;s more intelligent than we thought .
just like jeffrey dahmer , he &apos;s also deranged ,
but he &apos;s learned from others &apos; mistakes .
he knows not to keep strong smells around too long ,
which is why he disposes of the torsos within a few days .
there &apos;s a very good chance that he snapped because of serious rejection .
if he finally got the guts to ask a woman out ,
he would have been clumsy and aggressive
and she would have pushed him away .
it &apos;s why he got rid of all the things that symbolized intimacy .
it &apos;s how his psychopathology developed .
but if this is about a girl that rejected him ,
why kill a guy first ?
he might be connected to the second victim .
but without their identities , we can &apos;t say for sure .
what about the revisiting ? can we catch him like that ?
he &apos;s obsessive about these locations ,
but he &apos;s probably seen the surveillance .
well , then , what will he do ?
he &apos;ll find another victim .
you &apos;d think after 10 years i &apos;d seen it all .
how many sites are there , mama ?
hundreds . and that gem of a fellow you &apos;ve got in custody
has looked at all of them at one time or another .
anonymity is huge for these sites .
they use a tor network , which is an onion router .
the point is , you &apos;re not gonna be able to find anyone this way .
do you know there are actual variations on a disarticulation fetish ?
i need baby kitten pics asap .
oh , have you seen the hippo who lives with the family ?
what ?
sleeps with a blanket ,
gets massages , eats better than i do .
where is that ?
south africa . it &apos;s amazing .
trust me , i have an arsenal of cuteness .
have you seen the one with the baby elephant--
oh , with the baby chicks ?
yes , i love that one .
uh , hey , you guys ?
sorry .
sorry .
the most recent victim was taken from riverside .
that &apos;s more than 2.1 / 2 hours away from here .
so his comfort zone isn &apos;t limited to here .
that &apos;s not good . he &apos;s got a lot more confidence than we thought .
he &apos;s leaving vics here ,
so he must have some connection to bakersfield .
the m.e. says he &apos;s gotten better at ligating each victim ,
which means he may have had practice .
on what ?
we didn &apos;t originally profile him
as an acrotomophile , but that sort of attraction
typically has deep roots in childhood .
maybe the unsub grew up around dead bodies , like a funeral home ,
so it wasn &apos;t that big of a leap for him .
it could be . we know he wasn &apos;t social enough
to continue the family tradition ,
so maybe he found work in a morgue or a hospital .
when you say work ...
security guard , janitor , anything entry level .
uh , the uc system has a medical facility in bakersfield .
anyone fired recently ?
no , but there &apos;s an anatomy professor on sabbatical .
oh , what &apos;s his name ?
dylan myers .
clear .
clear .
he definitely revisited .
no ...
get away .
no ! please don &apos;t !
please don &apos;t !
let me go !
please !
please ...
no ! no ! please don &apos;t !
please ! please don &apos;t !
landlord says he paid his rent in cash
for the first time last month .
left it in an envelope , and he hasn &apos;t seen him in a while .
he needs privacy to pull off what he does .
sharing walls with neighbors isn &apos;t going to give him that .
if he plays for this place in cash ,
chances are it &apos;s also how he pays for a secondary location .
yeah , but where is it ? we know who he is ,
but we have no idea where he &apos;s hiding .
and garcia has nothing strange on this guy .
well , we know he &apos;s methodical and obsessive .
and he &apos;s kept more trophies .
kid , you ok ?
yeah . you ?
just tired .
dr. lee sent this over . the most recent victim
had more than just leather particulates in her stomach .
she chewed through it , leaving entire chunks behind .
and she also found traces of horse hair .
he &apos;s using a bridle .
this guy could have used anything . why that ?
it &apos;s either specific to his fantasy
or something he had easy access to .
how many horse ranches are around here ?
what &apos;s your name ?
i &apos;m angie .
where are you going ?
no .
no . no , please , you don &apos;t have to do this .
please , i just want to talk to you .
please , i just want to talk to you ...
it must get so lonely here .
let me stay with you .
i didn &apos;t picture him as the sentimental type .
cute kid . looks so normal .
you &apos;d like to think they all start out that way .
i don &apos;t know . some never have a chance .
they lose the genetics lottery right of the bat .
you know , there &apos;s no evidence of his family anywhere in this space .
maybe that &apos;s what made him feel so isolated .
yeah . we said he was a loner ,
but in all these old photos ,
he &apos;s surrounded by friends and family .
that doesn &apos;t fit the profile .
i &apos;m so cold .
is that--
is that better ?
thank you .
tech said there &apos;s a layer of dust over everything .
it doesn &apos;t look like he &apos;s been living here for weeks .
so why did he pay the rent
if he wasn &apos;t going to stay here ?
what have you got ?
everything in the unsub &apos;s behavior
points to an extreme introvert .
this guy &apos;s got a lot of family photos ,
has a fondness for the myers family crest . it &apos;s scottish .
he even has a tattoo of it right above his heart .
hang on .
that &apos;s weird .
does he have any other tattoos ?
no , but a nasty surgery . gallbladder , maybe ?
it &apos;s not a coincidence
that the marks that could identify him are mutilated .
are you thinking what i &apos;m thinking ?
dylan myers isn &apos;t the unsub . he &apos;s the first victim .
so the real unsub killed myers and then framed him .
but it &apos;s not just a countermeasure .
he took out a lot of rage on this man for a reason .
maybe this dylan myers stood in the way
of the unsub &apos;s true object of affection .
well , it makes sense since we thought
the first and second victims were connected .
only dylan myers was single .
garcia , was dylan myers dating anyone ?
he was a bit of a hermit ,
and like i said , zero social media skills ,
did go old school with a land line .
tracking his frequently called numbers .
he called a young woman named christine locke
several times .
she &apos;s a former student , lives in bakersfield .
and she &apos;s missing .
sending you her picture now .
she looks like the second victim .
did she have a restraining order out on anyone ?
checking now .
uh , yes . she filed for and was granted a restraining order
on august 6 from a steven parkett .
and where is he ?
probably on his way to hell in a handbasket , sir .
he was raised and lives at a cattle ranch and slaughterhouse
in bishopville just outside of bakersfield .
sending you the coordinates now .
can we go for a walk ?
it &apos;d be really nice .
you &apos;ll have to untie me .
ok ?
just for a minute .
parkett grew up isolated , just like we thought .
mother died in childbirth .
no siblings . the father was a violent schizophrenic ,
aggravated by chronic alcoholism .
genetics . didn &apos;t have much of a chance .
stop , please !
what the hell --
please !
please !
he &apos;s coming !
where ?
he &apos;s right behind me !
look .
all right , we need to split up .
jj , take the back door , and kate and i will take the front .
keep your eyes open . he &apos;s gonna be close .
&quot; just because everything is different
doesn &apos;t mean anything has changed . &quot;
irene peter .
how many did you get ?
uh , 10 .
well , uh , vitamin e oil helps with the scarring .
have you ever tried cocoa butter ?
no .
yeah . 6 stitches inside , 8 out .
guy got through the tendon . port authority .
tortured , last year . good times .
yes .
oh , and don &apos;t even get this guy started .
what are we doing ? are we talking battle scars ?
oh , yeah . i probably hold the record .
so what are the rules ? are we just talking stitch counts ,
or we going full on with like broken ribs ,
pistol whips , concussions ?
you weren &apos;t kidding .
told you .
well , why don &apos;t we start with the most recent .
guy hit me in the arm . same guy hit me twice in the chest ,
but i was wearing my vest , so i only ended up getting welts .
you see , these idiots ,
they think they can beat me , but they can &apos;t ,
so they at least try to hurt me , you know ?
what else ? oh , let &apos;s not forget
when i got blindsided and thrown out a window .
welcome to the team , callahan .
thanks .
almost done .
i figured .
so , did that last victim remember anything
about her abduction ?
she said that she &apos;d gone out for a jog ,
she got hit over the head , and she woke up with parkett .
she was from bakersfield ?
san diego .
that &apos;s weird .
i &apos;m just surprised that he traveled that far to hunt .
you know , all those hours in a car with a live victim .
i didn &apos;t think he had the guts or patience for that .
we caught him . there &apos;s no doubt he &apos;s guilty .
i know .
and nothing in the behavior points to a partner .
right .
you asked me how i leave it at the office .
when you solve it , let it go .
easier said than done , though , right ?
sometimes .
well , good night , or morning .
you know what i mean .
get some sleep .
yeah , you , too .
thanks .
how was your first case ?
long . how &apos;s the paper coming ?
read it tonight .
it &apos;ll cure your insomnia .
ha ha .
what time is it ?
almost 7 : 00 .
time for you to get up . you want some french toast ?
