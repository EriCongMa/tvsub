so i sign this , and the bribery allegations are gone ?
and no one ever knows a thing .
you never let me tell you what the money was for .
you didn &apos;t listen to me when i told you i don &apos;t care .
well , do you care that after mike grilled me ,
i was so impressed with him
that i wonder why i &apos;d forgotten him .
but i couldn &apos;t find any record of him
ever being in my class .
just like they &apos;re not gonna find any record
of you accepting a bribe from a student .
jessica ,
your secret is safe with me .
i told him you found out
that i covered up daniel hardman &apos;s embezzlement
and now you want me to protect another one of your secrets .
it &apos;s the same secret , louis ,
and you have just as much invested in it as i do .
you want me to kiss the ring , louis ,
after what you did ?
you &apos;re damn right i do ,
because i don &apos;t care how it got up there .
my name is on that wall .
whether you like it or not .
what do you think of this tie ?
i think ...
i want to tie you up with it .
really ? and what brought that on ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m feeling powerful .
okay , well ,
then let &apos;s make
that happen .
wait .
is this to do things to me
or just to get control of the remote ?
why can &apos;t it be both ?
rachel , if you think i &apos;m gonna let you watch game of thrones
while sexually dominating me ,
then you are absolutely right .
seriously , what &apos;s got you feeling so good ?
oh , it just feels like such a weight off
now that louis doesn &apos;t--
despise me ?
ah , you know what else would feel like a weight off ?
no . no , no , no .
nobody ever calls the landline except my parents .
what if something &apos;s wrong ?
it &apos;s fine .
mike .
okay , okay , okay .
hello .
yeah , this is him .
yeah , of course i can come meet you .
can i ask what this is-- hello ?
who was it ?
professor gerard .
he wants me to go meet him .
did he say what it was about ?
no , he hung up .
when does he want you to meet him ?
right now .
professor gerard .
thanks for coming .
i wouldn &apos;t have bothered you if it wasn &apos;t important .
it &apos;s not a problem . what can i help you with ?
it &apos;s not me .
a former employee at liberty rail reached out to me .
he claims he was fired because he knows the real reason for the crash .
and what was the real reason ?
he wouldn &apos;t tell me .
well , what did he tell you ?
enough for me to know it would be unethical
if somebody didn &apos;t look into this .
but you can &apos;t , so you want me to get harvey to .
well , you convinced him to look into my case
when he didn &apos;t want to , didn &apos;t you ?
this is different . we don &apos;t take cases like this .
maybe ,
but i believe a man who can convince harvey
to hire someone who never went to law school
could convince him to make an exception for this .
what ?
he didn &apos;t tell you i know .
no , he didn &apos;t .
well , i do .
but what i &apos;m asking you to do and me knowing
have nothing to do with each other .
i appreciate that .
does that mean that you &apos;re gonna tell him to take the case ?
i have a better idea .
got a second ?
of course . what do you need ?
i &apos;d like you to sign off on my vacation request .
paris .
i &apos;ve never heard you talk about paris .
no , but i have heard you talk about it ,
which is why i &apos;m taking you .
are you asking me to go to paris with you ?
i believe i just did .
jeff , do you have any idea
how much is on my plate right now ?
actually , i do , all of which harvey has agreed to cover .
you went to harvey with this .
well , i would have come to you first ,
but then it really wouldn &apos;t be a surprise .
i &apos;ll think about it .
take all the time you need .
but in the meantime ,
i &apos;ll be thinking about who else around here i can take .
really ?
well , you &apos;re awfully sure of yourself .
you think i haven &apos;t seen the way norma looks at me ?
calls me the black stallion .
norma .
taking a case .
what kind of case ?
what does it matter ?
because you wouldn &apos;t be announcing it like that
if there wasn &apos;t something wrong .
it &apos;s a case that came from professor gerard .
what ?
a man who used to work at liberty rail
says the real cause of the crash was covered up .
then refer him to a firm
that takes whistle @-@ blower cases , because we don &apos;t .
yeah , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
then don &apos;t , but there &apos;s a reason
lawyers who take whistle @-@ blower cases don &apos;t work here ,
and it &apos;s because corporations
don &apos;t appreciate shakedown artists .
and what if this isn &apos;t a shakedown ?
and how do you know it isn &apos;t ?
what i know is that innocent people died--
mothers and fathers and sons and daughters--
and if somebody &apos;s covering up why that happened
and i can stop it , then i &apos;m going to .
and i said you &apos;re not .
well , but you also said that professor gerard
didn &apos;t know my secret .
harvey , i know , i know he &apos;ll never tell anyone ,
but someday , someone &apos;s gonna find out who will ,
and i &apos;ll be done .
mike , he &apos;s not--
harvey , i got into this whole thing
so that i could try to help people ,
and i don &apos;t know how much time i have left ,
so please ,
let me try and help these people .
then you better make damn sure
this whistle @-@ blower isn &apos;t full of shit .
bonjour , madame .
oh , i &apos;m so glad you started with that french bullshit ,
because that &apos;s what i want to talk to you about .
i know .
never thought i &apos;d have someone ask my permission to take you to paris .
you know damn well that &apos;s not what jeff did .
jessica , what exactly do you want to talk about ?
i want to know why you cleared my schedule .
because jeff asked me to ,
and i can &apos;t remember the last time you took a vacation .
when &apos;s the last time you took a vacation ?
i &apos;m not the one in a serious relationship .
oh , so you &apos;re playing matchmaker for me now ?
oh , i &apos;m not playing anything .
and you were the one who said you had to choose
between hiring him and continuing to see him .
and then i changed my mind .
and i don &apos;t want you to make the same mistake i did .
what are you talking about ?
i should have taken some time with scottie .
jeff and i are not you and scottie .
jessica , take a vacation .
don &apos;t take a vacation .
the man came in here ,
asking me for help because he wants to go away with you ,
and i said yes because i &apos;m not gonna be the reason he can &apos;t .
pearson specter , how may i direct your call ?
pearson specter , how may i direct your call ?
louis , do you have a minute ?
no , i don &apos;t .
okay . what are you doing ?
pearson specter , how may i direct your call ?
pearson specter , how may i direct your call ?
you hear ?
pearson specter , how may i direct your call ?
hello ? pearson specter ...
you hear that ?
where &apos;s the litt ?
every call is like a slap in the face .
louis , it &apos;s standard practice for a law firm
to shorten their name on the phone .
so blatant disrespect is standard practice now ?
it &apos;s not disrespect . it &apos;s just ...
you &apos;re telling me that your father doesn &apos;t
have them answer the phone ,
&quot; rand , kaldore , zane &quot; ?
actually , no , he doesn &apos;t ,
and i think you &apos;d agree that people respect my father .
unless you want to go back to telling me
that he &apos;s a shady lawyer .
come on , rachel , that was when i was mad at you .
which is actually why i wanted to come and talk to you .
i want to thank you for forgiving mike .
it--it means a lot to me .
now , can you stop obsessing over the phone
long enough to hear that ?
i &apos;m sorry , rachel ,
but i can &apos;t .
and now i have to go rip that receptionist a new ass--
louis , if one of your first acts as name partner
is to rip the receptionist to shreds ,
you &apos;ll regret that for the rest of your life .
just let it go .
let it go .
things will run their course .
you know what , rachel ? you &apos;re right .
and by the way , i &apos;m glad that we &apos;re friends again .
pearson specter ...
harvey , what are you doing at 3 : 30 this afternoon ?
why ?
i have some news , and i don &apos;t want you to overreact .
what is it ?
jeffrey bender wants to meet with you .
he heard we &apos;re taking a whistle @-@ blower case ,
and he wants us to drop it .
relax , i &apos;ll take care of jeffrey bender .
wait a second , you &apos;re not gonna try
to cut mike &apos;s legs out from under him
before he even gets started ?
what &apos;s the point ?
he &apos;d just bother me until i agreed not to anyway .
i can &apos;t believe it .
you have no idea what to say .
what &apos;s the date today ? i want to write this down .
you know what ?
it &apos;s the seventh of kiss my ass ,
and tomorrow is the eighth of set your own goddamn meetings .
is that the mayan calendar ?
nope , that &apos;s the donna calendar .
i got you . for the record , i got you .
all right , take me through it one more time .
it &apos;s simple .
there are axles on all the cars in all the trains ,
and those axles have sensors to make sure they don &apos;t overheat .
so you &apos;re saying that the train crashed
because the heat sensors failed .
i &apos;m saying that all the heat sensors
on the entire fleet were faulty ,
and they knew about it .
then why didn &apos;t you come forward with this before ?
you mean before they fired me for coming forward with it ?
which brings me to my next question .
you &apos;ve had four different jobs in the last six years .
what are you getting at ?
i want to know why .
i move around .
it &apos;s not uncommon in my business .
move around or keep failing ?
i got fired for blowing the whistle ,
not for messing up on the job .
that &apos;s not what your last performance review says .
i don &apos;t give a shit what it says .
they used that as an excuse to fire me ,
and my reviews before i came forward
passed with flying colors .
i &apos;m a solid worker .
how the hell do you think i got this ?
i know your reviews are stellar .
what i need to know is if there &apos;s anything out there
that we don &apos;t have , because they are gonna come at us
any way they can , and when they do ,
it &apos;s not gonna be about heat sensors ,
it &apos;s gonna be about you .
yeah , i don &apos;t care if i &apos;m the worst guy in the world .
i know i &apos;m not the only guy in that company
that knows those sensors are faulty .
what are you talking about ?
what do you mean , there &apos;s a report ?
done after the crash that showed a defective part
was the real cause , not engineer error .
says the whistle @-@ blower .
says these .
that &apos;s a memo ordering the report
and another email acknowledging its existence .
we got &apos; em .
we do .
set a meeting .
let them do the talking , then drop the hammer ,
and stick a settlement down their throat
before they know what hit them .
i appreciate the advice , harvey .
but this time i &apos;m going in with the hammer in my hand ,
and i am coming out swinging .
okay , big talker , how much you asking for ?
40 million .
are you kidding me ?
they &apos;ll pay ten times that without even trying .
not when i tell them they &apos;re gonna have to admit
what they did .
are you nuts ?
no , i am not .
we are not sealing this settlement ,
and before you say another word , this is my case .
i don &apos;t care whose case it is .
they &apos;re never going to admit what they did .
pick a higher number and let them seal it .
harvey , you told me to prove this wasn &apos;t a shakedown .
now you want me to take money to cover things up ?
you know what that is ? a shakedown !
a shakedown is when your case has no merit .
this is the way things work .
not to mention , if we quietly settle ,
we don &apos;t have to worry about scaring away our clients .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s the way things work .
harvey , people died in this crash !
and they &apos;re not coming back , no matter what liberty rail admits .
you are such a cold , heartless son of a bitch .
and this isn &apos;t about your parents ,
so back them into whatever corner you want ,
but when they refuse to admit what they did ,
you are not going to trial .
stay out of my case .
something smells delicious .
i &apos;m making us dinner , but it won &apos;t be ready for a while .
good , that means we have time
to go over my proposed itinerary .
i don &apos;t recall saying yes .
i thought that we would start
with a private tour of the rodin .
oh , the rodin .
god , i must have visited that sculpture garden a dozen times .
then i &apos;m so glad that i arranged for us to have a picnic
while we &apos;re there ,
and during that picnic ,
we can reminisce about the week before ,
where we danced the night away in the latin quarter .
we did ?
mm , or we &apos;ll talk about how we &apos;ll end the trip
in the loire valley ,
where we will sip wine along the seine .
jeff , this trip is perfect . how did you know ?
i know you &apos;ve always loved paris , so i started there .
and then i called your sister .
you did that for me ?
i did .
so what do you say ?
i say ...
if you knew what i was cooking ,
you &apos;d already know my answer .
looks french .
so you let me go through all that even though
you knew you were gonna say yes the entire time ?
aren &apos;t you glad i did ?
yes , jessica .
yes , i am .
donna , what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here because i can &apos;t take it anymore .
what ?
this place has no life , and i can &apos;t take it anymore .
and that &apos;s gonna add life ?
if i gave you something too needy ,
it would intimidate you , and you would let it die .
you expect me to believe that &apos;s why you &apos;re really here ?
of course not .
i &apos;m here to stop you from doing
what you &apos;re gonna do in an hour :
crash mike &apos;s meeting .
donna , i can &apos;t have him risking our other business .
it was one client , and you covered it .
and if he drags this to trial ,
it will be every client .
you don &apos;t know that .
yes , i do .
then trust him to accept that on his own .
donna--
harvey ,
when are you gonna let him be his own man ?
his own man ? he &apos;s out of control .
he &apos;s identifying these people with his parents .
and you &apos;re out of control because you can &apos;t
separate yourself from him .
okay , you need to stay out of it .
and i will , but you said you made a mistake
not trusting mike with gillis industries .
i &apos;m telling you , don &apos;t make that mistake again .
pearson specter , how may i direct your call ?
rand , kaldore , zane .
son of a bitch !
hello , liar .
excuse me ?
rand , kaldore , zane .
you know what that is ?
that &apos;s how they answer the phone at rand , kaldore , zane .
louis , i &apos;m sorry .
oh , save your sorrys .
do you know the receptionist at the front desk ?
yes , her name is elise .
good , you can use her name when you fire her .
i don &apos;t have the authority to fire people ,
but i did just talk to her .
you did ?
to set her straight .
that &apos;s good .
no , not good .
she came to see me .
she said that you &apos;ve been harassing her .
what happened ?
she said that you called and hung up on her over 50 times .
what ? how did she even know it was me ?
because you called from your office .
well , it wasn &apos;t harassment because it wasn &apos;t sexual .
well , she also said that you were leering at her
when you stepped off the elevator .
i wasn &apos;t leering !
i was mad about how she answered the phone .
louis , it doesn &apos;t matter why you did it .
she felt violated .
well , you know what , you tell her it &apos;s not like that ,
and then you violate her ass out the door .
louis , is this really the kind of name partner you want to be ?
no , i want to be the kind of name partner
that has his name said on the goddamn phone .
okay , well , in order to fire her
without getting sued for harassment ,
you &apos;d have to fire the entire support staff ,
and you and i both know that that &apos;s never going to happen .
we are not firing all of our support staff .
well , it &apos;s easy for you to say , being that your name is first .
what are you talking--
jessica , i am talking about respect .
r @-@ e @-@ s @-@ p @-@ e @-@ c @-@ t , find out what it means to me .
but i guess i &apos;ll just find my own way
to be treated how i deserve .
i know i &apos;m gonna regret asking this .
louis , tell me specifically what it is you &apos;re talking about .
they are answering the phones , &quot; pearson specter , &quot;
not &quot; pearson specter litt . &quot;
louis--
you don &apos;t believe me ? check it yourself .
i &apos;m not harassing our support staff .
it &apos;s not harassment , god damn it !
louis !
jessica , it &apos;s like they &apos;ve been specifically instructed
to leave my name off .
now you &apos;re just being paranoid .
i am not paranoid . they &apos;re in lockstep .
i &apos;m telling you , someone paid them off .
louis , that &apos;s insane ,
but if you want them to say your name ,
i will get them to say your name .
jessica , what can i do for you ?
you can explain to me why you paid our reception staff
not to say louis &apos; name when they answer the phone .
who says i did that ?
they do .
god damn it .
i paid them good money to keep louis
from finding out for at least a month .
he hasn &apos;t found out .
it wasn &apos;t him who got them to crack , it was me .
even still , i &apos;m asking for a refund .
jeff , i &apos;m serious about this .
i know you &apos;re pissed about how he got his name on the door ,
but i need you to bury the hatchet .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
why not ?
because every single time i see his rat face ,
i think about him blackmailing you ,
and it makes me want to walk over to him
and rip his arms off his body ,
and that little phone prank was just my way
of keeping myself from doing something like that .
i understand ,
and i do appreciate it ,
but i &apos;m not asking you to do it for him .
i &apos;m asking you to do it for me .
mr. ross .
all i can say about your filing is that i think
you might have a career writing fiction .
and if you don &apos;t hand over that report we &apos;re requesting ,
you &apos;re gonna have a career behind bars .
you &apos;re not here for that report .
you &apos;re here to strong arm my client into a big , fat check .
i &apos;m sorry to be the one to tell you this ,
but a big , fat check isn &apos;t gonna get you out of this .
is that a fact ?
sure as hell is ,
because we both know that report
says you &apos;re responsible for this accident ,
and we &apos;re not settling anything without you admitting it .
and we &apos;re not admitting something we didn &apos;t do .
what the hell is this ?
well , you wanted the report .
here it is .
your client wasn &apos;t lying about its existence .
he was just lying about everything else .
we ran repeated tests on our heat sensors ,
and they passed every one .
this is bullshit .
the only thing that &apos;s bullshit
is joe henderson .
he doesn &apos;t care about the accident .
all he &apos;s trying to do is shake us down ,
exactly like he did at his last four jobs .
what the hell is that ?
his last four lawsuits .
did you think we wouldn &apos;t find out about them
just because the records were sealed ?
mr. ross , your client &apos;s been playing
the whistle @-@ blower lottery for years .
he &apos;s never won before .
he &apos;s not going to win today .
you son of a bitch ,
you tried to blow the whistle
at every job you &apos;ve ever had , and now they know it !
keep your voice down .
you-- no , i &apos;ll keep my voice down
when you stop bullshitting me .
those claims were supposed to be sealed .
i don &apos;t care what they were supposed to be .
they found them , and you were supposed to tell me about them .
and what would you have done if i did ?
i would &apos;ve said what they said ,
that you don &apos;t give a shit about what they did !
you &apos;re just looking to get rich .
you think i would &apos;ve risked my job
and everything that i have for nothing ?
excuse me ?
i said , i don &apos;t see you working out of the goodness
of your heart in your $ 1,000 suit .
you have no idea who i am or why i do things .
and i told you , you don &apos;t have to be concerned about my history
because what i &apos;m telling you is true .
not according to this .
that &apos;s the report that you said gave us all the leverage
and they say proves them innocent .
that report is bullshit ,
because i &apos;m telling you , those sensors didn &apos;t work ,
and that was the cause of that accident .
well , i might have a leg to stand on
if you had any credibility at all .
how the hell am i supposed to get a jury to believe you
when i &apos;m not even sure i do ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m here to tell you to call the front desk .
oh , let me guess .
jessica told you they won &apos;t say my name
and you thought it was hilarious .
you &apos;re right , i did .
why don &apos;t you get the hell out of my office
and go laugh somewhere else ?
oh , you want to hit me now ?
yeah , well , why don &apos;t you go ask mike ross about my headlock ?
&apos;cause it &apos;s a goddamn vice .
pearson specter litt ,
how may i direct your call ?
it was you .
yes , it was me ,
but i fixed it , so ...
you can stop worrying if everybody at the firm
respects you , because they do .
everyone except you .
no , louis , including me .
listen , i may not like how you got your name on the wall ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean it shouldn &apos;t be up there .
congratulations , louis .
thanks , jeff .
hey , maybe we can even get drinks this week .
name partner buys .
deal .
done .
you can leave the coffee , but i &apos;m not getting up .
mike , you &apos;ve been working for seven hours straight .
you need a break .
i &apos;ve been working for seven hours
because if i tell harvey
what &apos;s going on before i have a fix ,
he is gonna pull the plug .
well , then maybe the plug needs to be pulled .
rachel , just because joe henderson is
a bullshit plaintiff doesn &apos;t mean
they didn &apos;t cover things up .
it doesn &apos;t mean that they did .
okay , fine .
why would he ask for that report
if he knew it would hurt our case ?
i don &apos;t know .
i don &apos;t know either ,
which is why i need more time .
well , then you need to convince harvey to let you keep going ,
because if you don &apos;t and he finds out--
he is not gonna find out .
mike , he &apos;s not gonna find out from me ,
but if i &apos;ve learned one thing in the last six months
of working here , it &apos;s that if he finds out from somebody else ,
you &apos;re gonna regret it .
you come here to tell me you &apos;re taking that vacation ?
i came by to ask when mike ross started taking
whistle @-@ blower cases .
jessica--
i want you to put the brakes on him
before this gets out of control .
well , i &apos;m not gonna do that .
harvey .
jessica , it &apos;s one case .
he asked me to trust him , and i &apos;m gonna do it ,
and if you &apos;re ever gonna be able to enjoy a vacation ,
you &apos;re gonna have to trust me .
all right . good night .
bon voyage .
you do know that doesn &apos;t mean &quot; good night . &quot;
of course i do .
do you know how to say &quot; good night &quot; in french ?
what , do you think i &apos;m some kind of neanderthal ?
you don &apos;t know one word of french , do you ?
mennage en trois .
you &apos;re an idiot .
mennage en quatre .
mennage en cinq .
can i come in ?
what &apos;s going on ?
we have a problem .
i &apos;m listening .
liberty rail &apos;s report directly contradicts our claim .
that &apos;s a big damn problem .
i believe my client , harvey .
based on what , your gut ?
no , i found the guy who wrote the report .
he &apos;s on indefinite leave in australia ,
where we can &apos;t subpoena him .
so it &apos;s our word against theirs .
which is why i &apos;m here .
joe henderson made four other claims in the last six years .
you &apos;re shitting me .
harvey--
that &apos;s it . i &apos;m pulling the plug .
i knew it .
i knew you would bail on me the second this thing
hit the smallest bump .
bail on you ?
i backed you because you told me you had a case .
i do have a case . i told you they got to this guy .
and you got no proof of that .
and if this were your case ,
you would be begging me for help to get it .
it &apos;s not my case . it &apos;s yours .
and now you &apos;re asking a jury
to believe these guys fabricated a report
based on the word of a career whistle @-@ blower .
no , i &apos;m asking you to believe it .
it doesn &apos;t matter what i believe .
this guy is a goddamn shakedown artist ,
and i &apos;m pulling the plug .
i don &apos;t care what he is .
i &apos;m not a goddamn shakedown artist !
mike -- - harvey , you told me that
those people weren &apos;t my parents ,
but they are somebody &apos;s parents .
please .
you got 24 hours .
you know it &apos;s against the law to litter , don &apos;t you ?
what do you want , donna ?
i know you went to see harvey .
you know that he wants me to fail .
that &apos;s not true .
i don &apos;t have anything , and he only gave me a day .
and if he wanted you to fail ,
he wouldn &apos;t have given you another second .
you know he thinks this is about my parents , right ?
is it ?
maybe it is ,
but what these people did is a million times worse
because they knew it could happen .
wait a second -- they knew this could happen ,
and they didn &apos;t fix it before ?
yeah , donna , and then they -- they rolled the dice .
well , what about now ?
are those trains still messed up ?
because that would make them monsters .
they are monsters , but that would also make them idiots ,
and they &apos;re not idiots .
well , what are you talking about ?
well , they must have fixed the sensors by now ;
otherwise if it happened again , they &apos;d all go to jail .
well , if they fixed the sensors ,
then there has to be - a paper trail .
of course there is .
then all you have to do is get it .
what do you think i &apos;ve been trying to figure out all night ?
what &apos;s to figure out ? subpoena it .
yeah , there &apos;s only one problem . harvey only gave me 24 hours .
but now that you &apos;ve come up with this ,
maybe harvey will change his mind .
donna , i have a theory that i can &apos;t prove and an opposition
that &apos;s shown they &apos;re willing to alter evidence .
he &apos;s not gonna change his mind , and you know it .
there &apos;s got to be another way .
donna , look , i appreciate what you &apos;re doing ,
but unless you have this other way in your pocket ,
please , just leave me alone and let me try
and think this thing through .
no ! i don &apos;t care what he says .
it &apos;s an active goddamn investigation ,
and i &apos;m not gonna stand around -- - you can &apos;t talk on that here .
hang on a second , charlie .
i &apos;m sorry , we got off on the wrong foot .
is your name danielle ?
that &apos;s what it says on the plate , isn &apos;t it ?
well , danielle , i &apos;m here to pick up the documents
i ordered an hour ago , and if you don &apos;t give them to me
in the next 15 seconds ,
today &apos;s gonna be your last day .
you didn &apos;t talk to me .
i said hold on , damn it .
look , i don &apos;t have time to play &quot; who spoke to who . &quot;
i am up from dc because , as it is ,
these documents weren &apos;t sent when they were promised .
i &apos;m sorry . what is it you need again ?
oh , jesus christ .
all the maintenance work orders from the past six months .
i can &apos;t let you have that without authorization .
well , then by all means , let &apos;s call your supervisor ,
and we can tell him how you &apos;d rather play farmville
than cooperate with me .
who did you say you &apos;re with again ?
have you heard of the national transportation safety board ?
they &apos;ll give you what you need in the back .
what did you do ?
i didn &apos;t do anything . what did you do ?
don &apos;t give me that . this makes my entire case ,
but i can &apos;t use it if i don &apos;t know where it came from .
oh , that looks like it came from liberty rail .
oh , oh , yeah , it just happened to walk itself
over from their secure facility .
well , it &apos;s possible that somebody went over there
and released it from their secure facility .
donna , if i go to harvey with this
and tell him what i know happened , he--
you don &apos;t know . you think .
don &apos;t lawyer me . he &apos;ll never let me use it .
well , then don &apos;t tell him what you think happened ,
because if you do , he &apos;ll make you drop the case .
okay , right now , i don &apos;t care about the case .
i care about you .
mike , i didn &apos;t steal anything .
i talked my way in , and that &apos;s what happened .
did you tell them this was discovery
for a case against them ?
no .
then it &apos;s not admissible in court .
well , then you have to figure out a way
to use it not in court ,
but don &apos;t ask me for my help on that .
i have done enough .
heard you wanted to see me .
i take it you patched things up with louis litt .
how do you know ?
oh , he wanted to know if you were a sports bar guy
or a wine bar guy .
did you tell him i &apos;m more of a strip club kind of guy ?
you really want to go to a strip club with louis litt ?
i don &apos;t really want to go to a strip club with anyone ,
but i do have a meeting in 10 minutes ,
and it &apos;s 15 minutes away .
oh , i just wanted to tell you
that i appreciate you patching things up with him .
there &apos;s no need to thank me .
i would do anything for the woman that i love ...
even get a drink with louis litt .
you here to talk about anderton software ?
because your 24 @-@ hour liberty rail pass is up .
then i guess it &apos;s a good thing
that just came in the mail for me .
what is it ?
maintenance records showing
they replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains
within six weeks after the derailment .
now , why would they do that if they never failed a safety test ?
they wouldn &apos;t .
which means joe henderson was telling the truth .
i can think of three different ways
they &apos;ll explain this away .
not if we can get them on record before they know we have it .
and why don &apos;t they know we have it ?
the same way i didn &apos;t know they got
joe henderson &apos;s sealed records .
which means you did something sketchy .
harvey , do you want to spend all night asking me
exactly what i did or did not do ,
or do you want to help me right a wrong ?
donna ?
set a deposition with liberty rail ,
and tell them this time it won &apos;t just be mike .
i &apos;m on it .
who the hell is that ?
that &apos;s the ceo of liberty rail .
yeah , i know who he is . who is she ?
that &apos;s their lawyer .
why didn &apos;t you tell me she was hot ?
because it &apos;s not relevant .
it is to me .
why ?
because she &apos;s hot .
you must be the infamous harvey specter .
you must be--
evan smith .
have to admit , when i saw your name was evan ,
i thought you were a man .
and i have to admit , when i saw your name was harvey ,
i thought you were a man .
i think i &apos;m in love .
i think you are too .
okay , can we get this over with ?
we sure can .
i don &apos;t even know how you have any questions at all ,
given our last meeting .
we just have a few .
mr. mcintyre , before the derailment ,
liberty rail conducted tests on the heat sensors on its trains .
is that correct ?
of course we did .
and why was that ?
we run tests on all our systems .
it &apos;s routine .
and the finding of that report
is that there were no problems with the heat sensors .
are you going to just ask questions
that you already know the answers to ?
it &apos;s routine .
there weren &apos;t any problems with the sensors .
and do you routinely replace the heat sensors ?
yes .
we replace them every five years
as part of our regularly scheduled maintenance .
and when was the last regularly scheduled maintenance ?
that would be two years ago .
and you wouldn &apos;t fix something that wasn &apos;t broken , right ?
of course not .
i &apos;m not in the business of wasting money , gentlemen .
i &apos;m a bit confused .
if you &apos;re not in the business of wasting money
and there was nothing wrong with those sensors ,
then why did you just replace all of them ?
they didn &apos;t replace all of them .
i think we &apos;d like your client to answer that question .
you &apos;re in a bit of a pickle , richard .
you don &apos;t know whether to say you did or you didn &apos;t .
of course , you could roll the dice with your own life
just like you did with other people &apos;s .
the truth is , it doesn &apos;t matter ,
because you already said on camera
you didn &apos;t replace those sensors .
and we have these .
where &apos;d you get these ?
i &apos;ll tell you what i told joe henderson .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they came from .
it just matters that they &apos;re here .
i need to talk to my client .
that &apos;s a good idea .
you should discuss how many zeros
you &apos;re gonna write on that check .
and one more thing .
you &apos;re not only gonna write a check .
you &apos;re gonna write a public admission
because people died in that crash .
that &apos;s not how this works .
it &apos;s how it works today .
you &apos;re really gonna force them to make a public admission ?
damn right , i am .
who are you , mahatma gandhi ?
somebody has to be .
you were too busy demanding a bunch of zeros .
well , i was just looking out for you .
those suits don &apos;t pay for themselves .
no , they don &apos;t .
mike , great job . you really stepped it up .
thanks , harvey .
i think you might be starting to come into your own too .
really ?
every single game ?
no , just the playoffs .
two sips ?
two sips .
no more , no less .
any beer ?
oh , no , not any beer .
miller lite .
miller lite ? what ?
but she &apos;s a queen .
what can i tell you ? she got it from her dad .
look , if the giants are in the playoffs
and jessica doesn &apos;t take two sips of miller lite
after every single first down ,
she thinks they &apos;re gonna lose ,
and there &apos;s no talking her out of it .
and those happen a lot , right ? first downs ?
they sure do .
so what is she like when she &apos;s drunk ?
well , that &apos;s a conversation for another time .
i so feel you , bro .
you know , i got to say , louis ,
i almost feel bad about pulling that prank on you .
don &apos;t feel bad .
it was a pretty good prank .
okay .
one more ?
only if you tell me more about what jessica &apos;s like at home .
no , screw that , i want you to tell me
what she was like back when it was pearson hardman .
done .
you &apos;re heading out for the night ?
in a few minutes .
want to grab a drink ?
celebrate ?
i can &apos;t .
why not ?
not that it &apos;s any of your concern ,
but i &apos;m having drinks with evan smith .
what ? you got her number ?
no , she called me .
oh , she asked for your number ?
no , she didn &apos;t have to . you gave it to her .
it was on that subpoena .
i know what &apos;s gonna be on your subpoena .
what does that even mean ?
you know what it means .
sure as hell do .
you wanted to see me ?
i did .
i take it you heard about liberty rail .
i did .
see ?
no harm , no foul , no mass exodus of clients .
i &apos;m glad .
what &apos;s on your mind , jessica ? you don &apos;t seem--
i know you told scottie about mike ross .
how &apos;d you know ?
i didn &apos;t till just now .
jessica--
i &apos;m not mad .
i just want to know what made you want to tell her .
what difference does that make ?
because i want to tell jeff the truth about mike ross too .
what changed between now
and when you fed him that louis bullshit ?
nothing &apos;s changed .
i just don &apos;t want to lie to him anymore .
he told you he loved you , didn &apos;t he ?
when the hell did you start figuring shit like that out ?
i didn &apos;t till just now .
then answer my question .
what made you decide to tell scottie ?
that &apos;s not what you really want to know .
what you want to know is if i wish i told her sooner .
do you ?
yes , i do .
hey , rachel , what can i do for you ?
i just wanted to come by and say thank you .
for what ?
oh , come on , donna .
mike told me you saved the day .
oh , well , you know ,
after i saved those kids from that burning building ,
i had a little extra time , so--
well , then maybe you should take the rest of the night off .
and why is that ?
because that &apos;s what superheroes do .
macallan 18 .
you got great taste .
surprised i called ?
like i said , you got great taste , but let me be clear .
you want to talk settlement ,
i can &apos;t do it without mike ross .
i &apos;m definitely not here to talk settlement .
good , because there are things i can do without him ,
exceptionally .
i want to show you a little video .
what , did you dig up footage
from my high school championship ?
because that &apos;ll make this too easy .
afraid not .
that &apos;s your secretary unlawfully gathering evidence ,
which means there will be no settlement of any kind .
and tomorrow , i &apos;m sending this to the district attorney .
enjoy your drink , handsome .
jessica .
jeff , there &apos;s something i need to tell you .
there &apos;s something i need to tell you too .
what &apos;s going on ?
what &apos;s going on is i just had drinks with louis ,
you know , as a favor to you .
turns out he &apos;s not so great at holding his liquor .
what did he do ?
no , he didn &apos;t do anything .
you did .
i don &apos;t--
you see , we were actually bonding
when i suddenly remembered what he had done to you ,
and i-- well , i wanted to make sure
that no one ever did that to you again .
so i asked him how he found out
about daniel hardman &apos;s embezzlement ,
and he started with the words ,
&quot; it was two years ago . &quot;
jeff , i can explain .
you can always explain ,
but that just means your whole story
about how louis got his name on the door is bullshit .
and i came here to tell you the truth .
more bullshit !
then let me tell you now .
don &apos;t you get it ? we &apos;re past that now .
i don &apos;t want to know !
jeff--
in fact , i never really wanted to know , i just--
i just wanted you to tell me .
but now , no matter what you tell me ,
i won &apos;t ever believe it &apos;s the truth .
jeff , let me in .
it &apos;s over , jessica .
it &apos;s done .
we &apos;re done .
