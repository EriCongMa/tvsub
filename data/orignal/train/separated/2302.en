第二十二集
Hi, m'lady.
I mean, uh, Violet.
I miss you.
Swan?
How are you here?
Zeus-- he must have sent me back.
And this isn't going to kill you,
it's going to end you.
No!
This is my kingdom.
To Robin!
?To Robin.
Regina.
Look, I know that there's nothing we can really say,
but we just want you to know...
you don't have to go through this alone.
She won't have to.
I think what my sister needs is a little time
with someone who understands what she's going through.
Zelena, we're sorry.
What happened with Hades, that...
can't exactly be easy.
We'll leave you two alone.
Henry.
Violet.
I'm sorry about Robin.
Thank you.
When I heard?you went to the Underworld,
I was afraid?I was never gonna see you again.
You were?
Me, too.
When we get to Granny's,
I think it's best if you wait outside.
Aye. Regina.
Robin's death -- it can't be easy for her.
And seeing you back when that's not possible for him?
Fate is cruel.
It could push her over the edge.
She cursed an entire kingdom when she lost her first love.
Yeah, but she's changed much since then.
I know.
But I still need to break the news about you carefully.
It's the right thing to do.
Belle, since your father refused to wake you,
I'm gonna have to find another way, and I will.
It's not just you I have to worry about now.
It's our family, our unborn child.
There's only one way I can free you both.
I need more power.
I need all of it.
Regina.
Emma, please.
I've already had enough people feeling sorry for me today.
I know.
I just think we should talk somewhere quiet.
It's kind of delicate.
What the hell was that?
Swan!
Is everything okay?
Hook.
What the bloody hell's the pirate doing here?
We thought we left you in the Underworld.
Aye, you did. But now I'm back.
Delicate, as always.
Regina.
I'm used to suffering, Swan,
and I'm used?to others getting their way.
Right now, neither one of our feelings matter.
Given that blast of magic,
there's only one person not present
who's powerful enough for something like that.
Gold.
He's got the Olympian crystal,
or part of it, anyway.
Some of it must have survived.
I can still feel the aura from it.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
He used it?to cast a tethering spell.
Tethering spell?
What was Gold attaching the crystal to?
Storybrooke's magic.
That's why he cast a spell here.
With that crystal, he can harness
all of this town's magic for his own purpose.
Gold already has?the power of all the Dark Ones.
Why does he need more?
To wake Belle.
True love's kiss didn't work
because she doesn't want to be with him.
Aye, and once the Crocodile wakes Belle,
do you think he'll stop there?
Do you think he'll just
turn the bloody crystal and all of its power over to us?
He's right. Let's go get that crystal.
Let's.
Where should we start?
Actually, um...
I was thinking maybe you should sit this one out.
Oh, that's why you were trying to be delicate with me.
You're worried the Evil Queen is about to come out to play.
No, I just want what's best for you.
No, you don't.
When you're upset, we follow you to Hell.
But when I'm upset, I get a time-out.
Okay.
You're not in any state to think straight about this.
And you don't get to tell me what to do.
Moms, please.
?Henry, now's not the time.
Maybe just take a minute to cool off and think about it.
You don't want my help. Fine.
I'll fix this on my own.
Kid...go to my place and stay there.
You'll be safe, okay?
We got this.
I mean it, Henry. Go right home.
Henry.
What's -- What's going on? I got your text.
It's my grandpa.
He's trying to steal Storybrooke's magic.
It made me realize how bad it is.
It's always magic. Always.
Magic turned my mom into a Dark One,
it took away the man my other mom loved,
and now...
now I think it's gonna tear my parents apart.
I used to think?there was light and dark magic,
but it's all bad.
Look around this shop.
These -- These are Geppetto's parents.
This needle has put dozens of people under a curse
they can't wake from,
and this -- an entire village is frozen in there.
It's hurt so many people.
My mother...
that's how she died -- magic.
Come with me on a road trip.
I-It's like a quest, but on a bus,
which is like a horse, but with wheels and seats.
J-Just -- just come with me.
What do you say? I think I can fix this.
My father would probably kill me.
B-But yes. Of course I'll come.
Great. Great.
We'll call it "Operation Mixtape."
There's just one more thing we're going to need.
I promised I'd never use this pen
to do anything?besides record what happens,
but what we're about to do is for the greater good.
What's that?
The crystal my grandpa tethered Storybrooke's magic to.
Wait, I-I-I don't understand. You said magic is bad.
Why are we going to take it out of Storybrooke?
To destroy it.
Once and for all.
So far, no sign of Gold,
which means we need to expand our search perimeter
to include the woods.
Where is he?
I told you.?We got this. We'll find Gold.
Not Gold. Henry.
"Mom, there's only one way
to fix everything that's tearing us apart.
I have to destroy --" - "The source of all of our problems."
I got the same text.
What does he mean? What is the source of all of our problems?
What is he going to destr...
Well, I think I can answer that.
The Olympian crystal and all the magic tethered to it.
It would appear my grandson has outsmarted us all,
used his authorial power
to steal the crystal right out from under my nose.
Would Henry even do that -- destroy magic?
We'd better hope he doesn't.
Why? What happens if Henry succeeds?
Considering this town was built with magic,
what do you think will happen?
He would never destroy magic if he knew it could hurt us.
I'll be sure to tell him that
right before I take the crystal back.
Don't you dare go near my son.
Sorry, dearie,?but he's threatening me now.
Regina, where are you going?
I just lost Robin. I'm not about to lose Henry, too.
I know, but we have to be smart about this.
Gold doesn't know where Henry is any more than we do.
We?
I don't remember inviting you to come along.
You benched me. Now I bench you.
Even if I knew how to find Henry?
All right, Sheriff Swan...
where is he?
You think after?all those times he ran away,
I wouldn't put a GPS app on his phone?
Let's get to the bug. We have to catch up to him.
Where's he headed?
Boston.
Is it true? Magic might disappear?
Only if Henry destroys the crystal.
Which he won't, not with Emma and Regina searching for him.
Yeah, but what if they don't find him in time?
How are we gonna get back without magic?
It won't be a problem if we send you home now.
We?
I think you mean me, dear.
But this time, summon the portal without the twister?
You heroes ruin all the fun.
Very well.
He wasn't on the bus?
Lady, I don't know what to tell you. Everyone got off.
Then why does the GPS tracker still say he's on it?
Because Henry hid his phone under one of the seats.
He wanted us to think he came to Boston.
Ladies, if you don't mind, it's my lunch.
Got any more bright ideas?
Regina --
Well...that's new.
How's that even possible? We're in the land without magic.
And so is Henry, with the crystal.
And all of the magic from Storybrooke.
Regina, if our magic works out here,
Gold's magic works out here.
We've got to find Henry before he does.
Well, if he's not in Boston, then where is he?
I thought the spires of Camelot were tall.
Welcome to New York City.
Are you sure Regina won't mind us leaving without a goodbye?
She'll understand.
Robin would want him to grow up in Sherwood forest.
We'll come and visit you soon, okay?
And we'll even bring your baby sister.
For Regina.
From one of my papa's arrows.
How sweet.
She'll cherish it.
That's everyone.
Let's close it up.
What's happening?!
Stand back!
Zelena!
It must have something to do
with magic being tied to that bloody crystal!
Everyone okay?
For now. Look.
Well, we're certainly not in Storybrooke anymore.
?There has to be something in here that belongs to Henry.
I assume you have a map somewhere in this pigsty of yours.
In the glove box.
By the way, it was your idea to go to Hardee's.
Give me your hand.
Why? What is that?
What?
Worried I might make you take an eternal nap on a bus bench?
If you want to help Henry,
you're just gonna have to trust me.
?Now that there's magic in the world...
this just might work.
And if it does, you're going to lead us right to him.
Of course. New York.
I hope Gold doesn't know that yet.
Welcome to New York. It'll be $15.
I can't imagine living here.
It's overwhelming.
I thought the same thing when I first went to Camelot,
until you showed me around.
Well, I want to see this place, Henry, truly,
but -- but what does it have to do with destroying magic?
It's got to do with my dad.
Magic?tore apart his family, too,
when my grandpa became the Dark One.
And did he want to destroy magic, too?
The truth is, for a really long time.
No one else knows this, not even my moms.
He made me promise not to tell anyone.
It's safe with me, I promise.
See, that's why he was in New York.
He was trying to find a way to protect himself
in case his dad found him.
Right, and he thought the best way of doing that
was by destroying magic.
Did he ever figure it out?
He died before he could, but I know he got close.
He kept everything he found in a journal.
It's got to be in my dad's apartment.
Come on.
If this isn't Storybrooke or the Enchanted Forest,
then where are we?
Well, wherever we are,
I'd rather not stick around long enough to find out.
Can you...use the wand and get us back to Storybrooke?
Not quite.
So we're trapped in this mysterious realm,
wherever it is.
You can fix it, right?
Of course.
Do you happen to have any duct tape?
We're not affixing the bumper to that God-awful truck of yours.
This requires the proper potions,
none of which I have with me.
Well, then we're just gonna have to go find them.
Then we'll have to move quickly.
If we don't find Regina and Emma before Henry destroys magic,
fixing this wand won't matter.
We'll be cut off from Storybrooke for good.
Hold on, I hear something.
Excuse me.
Can you tell us what land we're in?
No need to run!
Please don't hurt me.
We just want to know what land we're in.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
It's okay.
You don't need to be afraid of us.
No, you don't understand.
You shouldn't be here. You have to go.
Well, that's what we want to do.
We're trying to get home to our families,
to a town called Storybrooke?
That's a s-strange name.
We need magic to get back there. Can you help us?
Magic? N-No, no, no. M-Magic is dangerous.
If I help you, I'll be punished.
Punished? By who?
By me.
I guess now we know what that groundsman was so afraid of.
This isn't like?any dungeon I've ever seen.
These bars are enchanted.
Magic won't get us out of here.
What about the wand? Do you still have it?
Should I be offended that he didn't frisk me?
Not that this?is any use to us in here.
?Hid it. Someone's coming.
There you are.
The prisoners who attacked my groundsman.
No, no, no. We didn't attack anyone.
This is just a big misunderstanding.
We just want to know where we are.
All you need to know
is that you don't want to be here,
and that you're the ones
who are going to be answering my questions.
Like why are you really here?
We just want to go home.
You must think me so naive.
I know you're lying.
I know who really sent you.
So tell me...
what does the Dark One want?
You know the bloody Crocodile?
Who are you? What do you really want?
Don't lie to me.
He's too strong.
Look, we get it. You're powerful.
But killing him?isn't gonna change the truth,
which is that we don't work for Rumplestiltskin.
He's our enemy.
He's the whole reason we're here.
He tried to steal magic from our town to wake the woman he loves.
She's...
...pregnant.
You expect me to believe that the Dark One has found love?
Yes.
So whatever grudge you have against him,
we have nothing to do with it.
Let us go, and you won't have to worry about us ever again.
In my experience,
if you really don't want to worry about something,
you lock it into a cage --
a strong cage, like this one.
It's when you unlock the cage...
...that's when the trouble starts.
Looks like Henry was here, but I don't think he was alone.
This is, uh, Henry and Violet's song.
They have a song?
He really likes her. She's a nice girl.
You're just saying that because you feel bad
about ripping her heart out in Camelot.
I'll like her a lot better
when I know where she's taken my son.
Well, I think I might be able to figure that out.
Yes.?He has definitely been here.
He tried to wipe?the search history clean.
Luckily, I can get it back.
I won't hold my breath.
Maybe there's something else in here
that can tell us where they've gone.
Did you find something?
One of Robin's books.
He must have brought it with him
from Storybrooke when he came here.
I know because I gave it to him.
It's a collection of this world's
legends about Robin Hood.
He used to laugh?at everything they got wrong.
What is it? Are you okay?
It's a letter from Robin to me.
He must have written it
when he was trying?to make things work with Marian.
Or your sister.
So what do I do?
You have to read it.
"My dear Regina, I know I shouldn't be writing this,
but I had to let you know how proud I am of you.
You opened your heart to love and let it change you.
And no matter what separates us, I know you'll always be
the heroine woman I fell in love with -- Robin."
Regina? You okay? What did it say?
Please, Emma,
if you're gonna try to make me feel better, don't.
No, I know that I can't, and I won't.
I'm...
sorry about earlier.
I was so wrapped up worrying about how you'd react to Hook,
I...
I wasn't there for you about Robin.
You want to know why I got so angry?
Because you're right.
The Evil Queen...
is inside me...
always trying to get out.
I can't expect you to get it.
Well, I fought the darkness.
You know I do understand.
All due respect, but you don't.
You went up to the precipice.
But you got pulled back before it consumed you.
I was consumed.
And I have to live with it every day.
I can't imagine how that feels.
It's exhausting.
I'm constantly at war with my instincts.
Like with Hook.
My first impulse...
was to rip his throat out
because it's not fair that he survives and Robin doesn't.
But I didn't.
Because now I know that's wrong.
Much as I want to give in to evil, I don't.
So I do good...
and hate every moment of it.
You hate doing good?
Yes.
It's complicated.
I know it's right, but it always leads to loss for me.
Yet I keep doing it now, and I keep suffering.
But I know the Evil Queen can't return, so...
that's how it has to be.
I'll never be at peace with myself.
That's not true.
You fell in love with Robin, and you were happy.
Yeah, and look what happened.
I am what I am.
I did what I did.
Many years ago, I had a choice.
Snow White told a secret.
And I could have chosen to forgive her.
Instead...
I did terrible things.
Unspeakable things.
That will always hang over me.
I've tried to be the hero.
And you have been.
What if it doesn't matter?
There's no redemption for me.
There's only suffering.
Because now I have a curse.
The curse of knowing the difference between good and evil.
And I'm caught between them.
If I revert, I lose everyone I love.
Henry...
my friends...
everyone.
And if I go forward trying to be good,
I have to live with my past darkness
and all its?well-deserved consequences.
I don't believe that.
I believe in you.
That's because...
you are good.
But for me,?it's a simple choice, really.
I'd rather suffer
than see that pain?on the people I care about.
This is my fate.
I'm trapped.
He's at the Midtown Library.
What are they doing there?
You want to go to the Rare Reading Room? Really?
Well, here we are.
No one's been back here in ages.
Most folks just come for the Y.A. stuff.
Well, good luck with your term paper.
My dad's journal said he had an appointment here.
Whatever he was looking for to destroy magic
must be in this room.
Start with these.
Read every page and then re-read it.
Because whatever my dad was looking for,
he never found it.
And you really think we can?
We have to.
That's impossible.
Henry, w-what did you find?
These books, they all look exactly like my Story Book.
They're magic. What are they doing in New York?
I've never seen?these characters in my book.
Look at this. There are so many stories.
?Wait, Henry, you told me
that all the stories in your book are real.
Yeah.
So maybe...
These are all real, too.
You all right?
Aye. Bloody fantastic.
Other than that, even in this hellish land,
the bloody Crocodile manages to get in my way.
What the devil do you think he did to that warden?
Well, with him, it could be anything.
Get ready. Someone's coming.
Okay.
Let's do this.
There you are.
What are you doing here?
What does it look like? I'm here to help you.
Help us? Last time, you wouldn't even talk to us.
That's because the warden was watching me.
I had no choice.
If you really want to help us,
prove it -- open those bloody bars.
I can't.
His orderly, Poole, keeps the key with him at all times.
I might be able to get the magic you need...
if you'll make a promise to me first.
Tell us. Anything.
When you leave this place,
promise you'll take me with you back to your home.
To Storybrooke? Why?
Because I wasn't always the gardener here.
I-I-I was a doctor,
b-before the warden took control and ruined everything.
He -- he made me a prisoner.
Look, we need magic so I can fix this wand.
I-I know exactly where to go.
The hospital lab, but...
I can't take anything
without the warden?knowing that it's missing.
You'll have to give the pieces to me so I can fix it there.
Then I'll bring them back.
Please understand,?that wand is our only way home.
Okay, so why should we trust you?
You've met the warden.
Trust me, I want to get away from him as much as you do.
This is a bad plan.
It's the only one we've got.
Now I see why my dad gave up.
There's nothing in here about destroying magic.
We came all this way for nothing.
Not for nothing.
You'll figure it out.
Henry!
Henry, I know why your dad never finished his quest.
It's because he never visited Camelot.
Back in Camelot,
my tutor used to show me paintings of the Holy Grail.
He said it was the source of all magic.
And it looked just like that.
But the Grail turned into Excalibur. That can't be it.
No, the Grail?was always silver, but...
this looks kind of like it-- it-- its twin.
And if the Grail really was the beginning of all magic...
This might be the end of it.
Yeah.
Stand back.
Why? What are you gonna --
You were right.
This will destroy magic.
So what do we do now? What -- what happens next?
Whatever it is,?it's not safe to do here.
Hello, Henry.
Violet, get behind me.
You're not getting this.
Not without a fight.
Too bad you're gonna lose.
What are you doing in here?
The w-w-warden wanted me to fix this.
It's a surgical instrument.
Well, if that's true,
you won't mind me asking the warden himself.
No. You can't do that.
You know he --?he doesn't like to be disturbed.
Now, like I said...
it's time to see the warden.
Why am I here?
Sorry to disturb you.
The doctor was in his lab fixing a wand
I can only imagine?he got from the prisoners.
And so you did this?
The doctor was running away.
I -- I had no choice.
But you know the rules.
No one hurts Dr. Jekyll.
Except me.
Oh, what a mess.
The doctor hasn't been brave enough to come down here
for quite some time.
He must think that these prisoners can help him.
Should we kill them just to be safe?
I would be happy to do it.
Oh, yes, I'm sure you would be.
The fact is, if the doctor is on to something,
this place that they told him about, this Storybrooke...
could be the answer we're looking for.
You mean it?
You think this could be the place?
I think that we have been trapped in this land
for far too long.
It's time that we found ourselves a home.
And so...
I shall allow the doctor to go through with his plan,
but I'm going to make one small alteration.
The doctor isn't the only one
who will be going to this Storybrooke.
We all will.
Henry! Are you okay?
Mom, where's Violet?
I'm right here. I'm all right.
What happened to you? To -- to both of you?
Grandpa. He has the crystal now.
Henry, what were you thinking?
Why would you try to destroy magic?
Do you really have to ask me that?
You finally?had a chance to be happy,
and then magic took it away from you,
just like with Daniel.
Henry, the Evil Queen is never coming back.
You don't have to worry about me.
I don't, because my other mom is doing that for me.
You thought she was gonna go all Evil Queen again.
I'm sorry.?I should have trusted Regina.
But you didn't!
Because you know how it goes for us.
Every time it looks like we could be happy,
magic just comes in and wrecks it.
Is that what you really think?
Yeah.
In case you both forgot, magic took away my dad.
And it took away Violet's mom.
And I don't know what I would do
if it took away one of you.
Henry.?- Don't!
Just don't.
Henry, what were you doing down here?
Following my dad's trail to figure out how to destroy magic.
But we didn't find anything.
It was just a waste of time.
So, what do we do now?
'Cause Henry's grandpa has the crystal.
Well, we have to find him.
Give me your hand.
Is this really gonna help find him?
This will tell us?if he's still in New York.
Why isn't it working?
Our magic, it's gone.
The crystal.
Gold must have done something to it.
What the hell is he doing?
He's not gonna give that magic back to anyone.
He's gonna keep it all for himself.
Well, we're gonna have to do it the old-fashioned way.
You're summoning the portal?
Is this how we get to this...
this Storybrooke?
No, for what we're after, you need to think bigger.
Then what are we doing?
Taking something
that will give us the power we need.
Now, when I wake you,
I think you'll finally understand
that everything I've done,
I've done for you and our child.
And then,
I'm gonna give you what you always wanted, Belle.
I'm gonna show you the world.
A portal.
Belle!
Belle!
Belle?
Belle?
Oh, no!
Oh, no.
I don't understand.
How is this box gonna help us find a home?
It's not the box that's important.
It's what's inside it.
Or rather, who.
If the Dark One ever wishes to see his wife again...
...he'll have to do exactly as I say.
