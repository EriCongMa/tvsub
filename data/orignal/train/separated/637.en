My father was an innocent man,
destroyed by powerful people.
The Graysons are behind this,
and they're gonna pay.
I've dedicated my life to avenging his death.
Eventually, someone's gonna find you out.
And I won't stop until they've all paid the price.
Word is that Conrad Grayson
is writing his memoirs.
I would love to talk more about it.
What do you want?
Conrad Grayson sent me.
If you want any future with your son,
you leave now.
You can't deny that we've made a good team.
I'm declaring my independence.
You can't do this alone.
Get the hell out of my house.
Daniel wants his ex-girlfriend to make our wedding cake.
Do you suspect something's amiss?
I think that you may be the one for Daniel.
Perhaps we could work together towards a common goal.
Looks like they're about to rekindle their past.
Then I have to make sure they have no future.
Secrecy causes even the simplest truth
to seem wondrous, mysterious.
It has the power to fuel passion
and seduce you into becoming someone you're not.
We should get going soon.
You did tell your parents I was coming, right?
Or that I exist?
I thought we'd surprise them.
But what if your mother hates me?
She won't.
And even if she does, I'll protect you.
But no matter how we try to guard our secrets,
to keep them close...
they all come out eventually.
I was hoping to get in there with you.
I can't. I'm--I'm running late.
You've been going in earlier and earlier all week.
Maybe we could get lunch today.
Find a secluded spot on the dock, have a picnic...
Yeah. I, uh...
I can't today. I got too much to do.
I promise... I'll make it up to you tomorrow.
I would hope so.
Our bridal shower is tomorrow.
Right.
I still don't get why my mother insisted it be co-ed.
Oh, everyone knows your mother prefers the company of men.
I'm just happy you'll be there to protect me from her.
Yeah.
That will be perfect, Rohan.
I'm on pins and needles.
That means I'm excited to see you.
Yes, perfect.
Call me when you land. Bye-bye.
Would you just, uh, dry-clean the silks, please?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Well, I see you're still taking advantage of our amenities.
Who was on the phone?
Oh, just a little surprise I'm planning for the shower.
Well, since you've suddenly gotten into the spirit of things,
maybe you wanna make the welcome toast?
I lost my phone.
Which relates how?
Well, I had the speech for Emily saved on there,
and I don't have time to recompose it.
Probably for the best
since I didn't inherit your talent for faking sincerity.
It's called being polite.
And perhaps we wouldn't have to be
if Sara had responded to my appeal.
I haven't heard from her all week.
Maybe because she's too busy sneaking around with Daniel.
I noticed her texting with him this morning,
So whatever carrot you dangled, it seems to be working.
She won't stop digging.
Margaux's determined to write this expos?
She's convinced it'll help "Voulez's" sales.
Yeah, but what exactly did she discover?
Nothing yet, but she's researching articles
on Grayson Global, Conrad,
the acquision of NolCorp, you.
Did she happen to see that I made, uh,
"People's" sexiest men alive list,
right behind Joel Mchale?
So what if Margaux manages to sniff out some truth?
You know, maybe it's time that a little gets out there.
Not when it involves Conrad.
All I'm asking is that if she contacts you,
don't give her any leads.
All right.
What are you doing?
Roommate-proofing.
Aiden Mathis is moving in.
Are you kidding me?
He's a decent guy.
Who caused me to send my son away.
Well, maybe that's not a bad thing.
You don't have to worry about Carl's safety till the wedding's over,
and when it is, they'll leave,
and you won't ever have to see Aiden again.
He's... he's leaving with Emily?
I didn't even know they were together.
Ems.
Didn't hear you sneak in.
Just brought a few things for Aiden.
Thanks again for helping us out.
Why didn't you tell me that that was your plan?
You knew I was leaving.
With the guy who tried to strong-arm me out of town?
You conveniently left that part out.
You gave me a deadline to end this.
You don't get to pass judgment about what I do when it's done.
You're right.
I don't.
Hey. Leaving so soon?
I have a few more things to check off my list.
Saw it first.
Now because I'm a gentleman, I'll hand it over.
A gentleman or a stalker?
Your text said you'd be here,
buying ingredients for my wedding cake.
That wasn't an invite?
No?
All right, I'll go.
No. Don't, don't. Don't.
I know Emily wanted lemon,
but, uh, I was just toying with a strawberry layer.
But you know your fiancee better than I do.
You think she'll put up a fight?
Sara...
what am I doing?
I'm sorry.
I just, uh...
this isn't like me, Danny.
My father ditched my mom for another woman.
I do not want to do that to Emily.
I haven't been able to get you out of my head
since the Fourth of July.
Yeah, well... you need to.
We both do.
Do we?
I mean that, honestly.
If we could just talk about all
Talk about it? You're getting married--
you're getting married in two weeks, Danny.
You should be talking to your fiancé.
You're right.
I know. I know.
I just can't...
help but wonder why you've come into my life when you did.
Well, uh...
It was good to see you.
Keep the change.
Thank you.
Danny! Wait.
I'll be here Sunday...
in case you're free.
Okay.
See you.
Hello, Sara.
I should've...
gotten the hint when Danny blew me off this morning.
I came to surprise him for lunch.
When I saw him pulling out of his parking lot,
I followed him here.
How long has it been going on?
This isn't what it looks like, Emily.
Really? So it's just a coincidence that you...
ran into each other here,
just like at the bakery and--
No, Emily,
you have misunderstood this whole situation.
Have I really?
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I guess it's just the stress of the wedding.
And God, Victoria--
She constantly t-treats me like I'm not good enough.
Oh, she does that to everyone.
Not you.
I'm sure you're the kind of girl a mother loves.
That's why I feel so threatened by you.
Thanks.
I am not perfect. Okay?
But you have to believe me.
I am not a home wrecker.
God, I'm sorry for breaking down on you.
It's okay.
Do me a favor-- don't tell Daniel.
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.
You shouldn't be.
Thank you.
We want that to be here.
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that should work.
Mr. Grayson.
I wasn't expecting you.
I didn't think I'd get to read pages so soon.
Sadly, you don't.
In fact, you'll have to wait until the book hits the shelves.
Since our preliminary discussion,
I was offered a more lucrative deal
from another publishing company.
You used my generosity to start a bidding war.
Oh, no. No, no. I just...
created my own marketplace.
It's a lesson every young entrepreneur should learn,
as referenced in my prologue.
Don't forget to preorder.
How you must miss the grandeur of your last office.
Oh, what we lack in space,
we also lack in illegal activity.
You're not still going forward with Margaux?
I told you, she's been investigating last year's events
and what happened in '93.
I took your advice and I moved on.
These are for you.
Since you've always fancied yourself a writer,
I thought maybe you could help me brainstorm a title.
Sure, but not today. I can't. I'm swamped.
Oh.
And yet, you still found time to shop for organic berries.
Did you pick them yourself?
I stopped by the farmers' market.
All my years on this earth,
there is only one thing that's taken me to places
I'd otherwise avoid.
I was meeting a friend.
A "friend"?
Or an ex?
Your mother mentioned
that you hired Sara to make your wedding cake.
I thought that an odd choice.
I'm just trying to help get her back on her feet, okay?
I owe her that much after what we put her through.
Wow. How noble of you.
And I think you are ready.
Ready for what?
For a Grayson rite of passage.
Why don't you come with me into the city?
That family is hiding something.
I've been collecting names of Grayson Global employees.
One of them will be willing to share their account.
I know you're afraid of what Daniel might do, but just...
talk to Nolan.
I mean, if there's a story to tell, he'll tell it.
And if not, there's no need to waste any more time on it.
Yeah, I'll try him tomorrow at the shower.
Thanks for letting me vent.
Oh. Of course.
But I need to go back to work.
Yeah. I'll walk you out.
See you later.
And to think, you owe me for that.
I am a miraculous matchmaker.
If only I could matchmake myself.
You'll find someone.
I can't even find my phone.
Figured I'd just buy a new one.
So that's my exciting life. What's new with you?
Not much. But, um...
I wanted to ask you,
What do you know about Aiden Mathis?
Are you in trouble? Because all I know about him
is that's what he handled for my parents.
He dealt with the messes they didn't want to.
Why do you ask?
Nolan brought him up. I was just curious.
Is everything okay?
主题 想念这些吗 夏洛特
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Rule number 17-- no fish for breakfast.
18--no killing on the premises.
Well, to be disregarded if, uh, my life is in danger.
I'll bear that in mind.
Ah. Most importantly, 19--
Always give a heads up call before coming home.
I am on the rebound,
So, bitch, don't kill my vibe.
Hmm. As you can see,
Some people never follow the "call first" rule.
Welcome back.
I am pleased to report that the Maldives...
eagerly awaits our arrival.
So... twisted, isn't it?
Planning a wedding with one guy,
and honeymoon with another?
There won't be a honeymoon
if we don't get the final details in place.
我要和你谈谈
I assume that you're not referring to
your garter and Daniel's boutonniere.
Primarily, tying Victoria to the murder weapon.
Since you've been exiled from Grayson manor--
I could probably help.
No, I don't want your fingerprints on any of this.
Look, I can handle this. That's why I'm back here.
Um, just keep an eye on Victoria.
And considering she hasn't contacted me,
she must believe she's got another way
of thwarting you and Daniel.
Then we'll let her believe that.
Right in here.
Sara. How lovely to see you.
I'm sorry I didn't return any of your calls.
Oh, for good reason.
I hear you've been very busy with Daniel.
Oh, please tell me I can scrap these wedding plans.
I can't speak for Danny, but, uh...
as for me...
I'm not gonna help you break up their engagement.
Sara, regret will haunt you if you let Daniel go.
Well, I'd rather deal with that
than the shame of breaking up a marriage.
There is no shame when it comes to Daniel's best interests.
But who's to say it is?
Emily's sweet, sincere, and exactly what Danny needs.
She loves him just as much as you do, if not more.
I don't know what lies that girl sold you,
but she cares about nothing but money and status.
Sara, I can prove it to you. Please?
Please give me a chance.
For Daniel's sake, please.
Well, if we've owned this place for decades,
why is this the first I'm hearing of it?
You haven't yet earned your spot in the club.
Soon you'll be married,
and your dues will be paid.
How the hell did you keep this from mom
when we were in the red?
Because the deed is solely in my name,
given to me by my father, whose father gave it to him.
No Mrs. Grayson has ever known about it.
You see, contrary to what they say,
the secret to staying happily married is secrecy.
I'm not keeping things from Emily, dad.
So I guess she knows about
your little trip to the farmers' market.
Look, Daniel, even Titans need a safe harbor from the storms--
professional or personal.
And you can trust Anderson here
to keep the nature of your escapades close to his vest.
I don't want to cheat on my wife.
That's what I'm afraid of, Daniel.
Look, I'm gonna put this to you as my father put it to me
when he first brought me here-- do not marry your mistress.
Emily is your perfect match.
So if you get bored, you know, switch paramours, not wives.
For one thing, it's far more cost-effective.
I mean, not that affairs are cheap.
I spent a pretty penny on a minx from the Rainbow Room,
one... too many of my secretaries,
and let's not forget Lydia...
may she rest in peace.
I can't believe we've reached the day
where I give you the keys to this place.
What if I don't want 'em?
Well, then I applaud your idealism
and say you stand by your morals for as long as you can.
But if you find yourself slipping,
just know that this is a place where you can fall...
without regret.
Daniel and I said
we weren't gonna exchange gifts at the shower,
but this morning I found this in the closet.
Can you just estimate its value
so I can match the sentiment?
Mm... 5k? 7 tops.
Slightly modest for a Grayson wedding gift, no?
Well, at least it proves that he's back on track,
Now that Sara's out of the equation.
How can you be so sure?
I checked his phone.
She hasn't returned any of his texts
since my little breakdown yesterday.
God,wish I could cry on a dime.
It would help sell my performance at your wedding.
Oh. For Daniel--
white gold, self-winding, 7k. Done.
What about this one?
The Logan Seafarer.
Press a button, it sends out an emergency transmission.
You could be lost in the Bermuda Triangle,
and help would come in 30 minutes or less.
That seems a little bit excessive.
I meant for you.
Considering what you're trying to pull off
at this wedding,
having a plan "B" couldn't hurt.
Don't worry. I'm not here for you.
Whoever you're here for, you're not welcome--
not after your last visit.
Jack, I was just trying to protect your family.
I lost my father at a young age
and my sister not long after,
so I know the pain of being ripped apart
from your own flesh and blood.
It was never my intention to separate you from your son.
Okay. Well, let's just hope you've done a better job
of thinking things through when it comes to Emily.
Are you trying to vet me, Jack?
Seems you've gone to great lengths to protect her mission.
But what about her?
It's endearing what you're doing,
but you've no right.
I know the two of you had
what could only be described as puppy love,
but that's the past, and it's forgotten.
I'm the future.
You trying to convince me or yourself?
Oh, I do hope we have your support going forward, Jack,
because I don't deal with complications as well as Emily.
Thanks for meeting me.
I have no one else to turn to.
I find that hard to believe, as you barely know me.
And I can't imagine I got Jack's recommendation.
I know what you did for my parents,
and I need you to do the same for me.
Well, what are we talking about exactly?
When I went to Europe, I met this guy.
A photographer.
Things happened, and he took some...
artistic shots of me.
Nude.
I was in an awful headspace.
Some creep stole my phone, found the photos,
and now he's blackmailing me.
You do know I don't work for your parents anymore, right?
Good. This can't get back to them.
Or anyone else, for that matter.
Okay. Well, how did he contact you?
By e-mail.
He wants 40 grand.
Can you make it go away?
Look, I'm--I'm already late to my brother's shower, so--
No. Um, give me your... computer.
I'll, um... establish contact. I'll take it from there.
How much is it gonna cost me?
No, don't sweat it.
First one's free.
I'm surprised you got my mother a hostess present.
You playing nice?
Not for her.
I thought... I thought we said no gifts.
Well, now I feel like a jackass.
I-I left yours at home.
Oh, you can give it to me later.
Oh, welcome, darlings.
I hope that everything pleases you.
No expense was spared
to meet all of your expectations, Emily,
and all of your desires, Daniel.
In fact,
I hired Ms. Munello to handle today's festivities.
After all,
it isn't the worst idea to get a taste of what's to come.
It took some time for my brother
to find someone who'd put up with him.
And I get that. He can be annoying.
But he's still my best friend.
So, Emily, be good to him,
or you'll have me to deal with.
To Daniel and Emily.
To Daniel and Emily.
I see you drank to that.
Refills?
I'll get us all one.
That was lovely, Charlotte. Thank you.
I meant every word.
Ms. Grayson? Someone phoned for you.
Excuse me.
Well, now who's the stalker?
Well, at least I have a legitimate excuse.
Do you? When I saw you yesterday,
you didn't mention you'd be working the party.
Well, uh, it was a last-minute offer,
And, well, I couldn't afford to say no.
Well, just so long as you're working for my mother
not with her?
Why would you say that?
Because she seems abnormally giddy today,
and that usually means she's up to something.
I should get back to work.
It's not like we can't talk to each other, Sara.
We're not doing anything wrong.
It's the fact that we want to.
Hello again, Sara.
Em, can you believe these little things?
They're like cakes for elves.
Wow. Sara really can do it all, can't she?
Thanks to you, I know our wedding's gonna be perfect.
Gather around, everyone.
We're going to play a little game.
Conrad, Daniel, come here.
Since when does my mother play games?
I know you were expecting somebody far prettier,
But Charlotte sends her regrets.
I take it you brought the phone?
Look, man, my deal's with the girl.
Well, I'm her representative. You can give it to me.
Not until I see the money, I'm not.
Okay, $40,000, right?
You see, I'm not sure that that's very fair.
Oh? Well, see, uh, TMZ, they're--
they're willing to pay almost as much.
You know, they pay top dollar for celeb nudie photographs.
Yeah, but what's the price for a girl's innocence?
That slut is anything but innocent.
You know that's someone's little girl.
That's someone's sister.
Whatever your thing is, I don't--
Hey, hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up! Take it easy!
Remember what I said about complications, Jack?
Don't be one.
Jack, leave him alone.
While I'm not the type
to partake in wedding shower games,
my wife insisted.
And as my son will soon learn,
your wife not only dictates
the games you play and the rules,
but somehow she always wins.
And today, she has conjured up
her own modest version of "This is your life."
And we invite you
to take a trip with daniel down memory lane.
Now as many of you know, I'm writing my memoirs--
Ah, how's that for a shameless plug?
And in doing so,
I've been recalling danny's many nicknames.
He was "Graystroke" at Harvard,
"Boone" at summer camp,
And in high school, his lacrosse team dubbed him...
"Ankle breaker," '
cause he broke mine during J.V. playoffs.
James Dennis.
How you doing?
Good to see you.
Well done.
Conrad screwed me over.
A feeling you must be all too familiar with.
Seems all your hardships began
after grayson global's acquisition of Nolcorp.
My problems started long before that, kitten.
And as much as I would love to scapegoat Conrad for them,
it's not my style.
But take it from someone who was the inside--
there's nothing about Grayson Global
that's worth writing in a bathroom stall,
let alone in a book.
End of story.
Too bad.
It seems it's time I moved on.
Smart girl.
Emily, come join me, will you?
Ah. Well, it breaks my heart
that Emily has so few friends and family,
Especially since moments like these
should be shared by loved ones.
Finding someone to participate today was no easy feat,
but... I did stumble upon a very old acquaintance.
He's very handsome,
A bit of a Silver Fox,
and extremely wealthy.
Surely you haven't forgotten that.
After all...
he was your husband.
What?
Kya haal chaal hai, Emily?
Rohan.
I can't believe it.
What are you doing, Victoria?
Never do you write or call.
I see now why.
How busy you must be with this young one.
How I missed you so.
This is a joke, right?
It's not what you think.
It was a marriage of convenience.
Oh. I hadn't realized that.
It wasn't my most honest moment, but...
I did it to help Rohan.
Oh? With what?
True love.
I was being in danger of deportation,
and I had just fallen for someone.
I helped Rohan obtain his green card
so that he could stay with his partner Benny. Hi!
You told me on the phone
that the marriage was a disaster and left you penniless.
You said that?
Well, my English sometimes up and down.
It was Ro who almost bled me dry
in the brief time that we were together.
He's never been good with money.
He still isn't.
But enough of me.
To Emily, who helped me find love.
How happy I am that she has found hers.
I am on the pins and needles for you and Daniel.
It means "Excited," Yes?
Victoria, what a thoughtful gift.
I must find a way to repay you.
Daniel, I should've told you.
Just by the time we were engaged, I...
I felt awkward bringing it up.
I should've known that your mother would try to use it against me.
Well, yeah, that's what she does.
You took it in stride, though.
Well, I guess I'm getting used to it.
I'd love for you to meet Rohan.
Yes.
So now you've seen her ability to spin the truth.
Hers or yours?
I should never have come here.
I was naive... or hopeful.
Yeah, maybe you're right that
Emily and Danny won't work out.
But it won't be her fault.
You cannot be fooled by that girl.
You think you're protecting your son...
but your psycho obsession's only hurting him.
Let him go.
I'm gonna do the same.
Good-bye, Victoria.
You were schooled in revenge, too?
When I first went to Japan, Rohan was training with Takeda.
He's since completed his mission.
Oh. Well, how did yours end?
Is the person who wronged you in jail?
Dead?
Worse?
We're taught once our goal's complete,
not to mention it again.
Don't brag after a shag.
Got it.
Though the whole green card thing,
I assume that was part of today's act.
No, no.
Emily actually did that for me.
Thanks to her, I found happiness after revenge.
I hope she'll find the same.
So you were married,
but you weren't a gold digger?
No, no. Rohan made his fortune long before we met.
Not by digging gold, but mining rubies.
Ooh, I almost forgot...
You bought the Seafarer.
I was hoping you could set it in something more suitable for a bride.
A ruby, perhaps?
Red is her favorite color.
It'll be my wedding present to you.
Benny's waiting.
Thank you. Bye.
When you confessed to Bizzy Preston about your marriage,
you knew that Victoria would take the bait,
and spend the next two weeks chasing her tail.
And anyone who was there today
can testify to how desperate Victoria was
to destroy my engagement.
The evidence does keep piling up.
This is gonna be one hell of a wedding.
I wasn't sure you got my text.
Danny. Um...
I only came to say that I won't be making your wedding cake.
And... good-bye.
What?
Is this--is this because I accused you of working with my mother?
If--if so, I'm sorry.
No, no. Please don't be. You weren't wrong.
Okay, for the past two weeks,
she's been trying to snake charm me
into coming between you and Emily.
And--and I couldn't do that.
Especially after what I saw today.
Oh, well, after what I saw,
I don't think I can go through with this wedding.
And it took until today to realize
that Emily and my mother are the same person.
And I do not wanna marry my mother.
Can I show you something?
Remember this?
I gave it to you that summer.
I never told you, but...
After the accident, I thought I'd lost you.
I spent that night pacing the hospital halls,
by the time the doctors came by to tell me that you were stable,
the diamond had cut into my palm from clenching it so tightly.
I mean, I didn't even realize the E.M.T.S had given it to me.
You held onto it all this time.
I never...
Thought you'd allow me the chance to return it.
We can't undo our past, Danny.
I know.
I just don't wanna forget it, either.
Can I?
I'm not asking you to commit to anything.
I just can't commit to Emily,
not when I feel this way about you.
I won't risk losing you again.
Mm. No. No, no, no.
No, we can't do this.
Okay? Not until you've spoken to her.
We won't. We won't.
I just don't wanna say good night.
Someone had the daft idea of sending these here after the shower.
And I thought that you might want to take these home.
So you could get an early start on your thank-yous.
It seems you could've had your staff bring them down toy house.
Oh yes,
but there's one gift I wouldn't trust anyone to deliver.
But you've already given me the greatest gift, Victoria.
It was lovely to see Rohan again.
Emily...
Had I known that you were keeping such a secret from Daniel.
That what you were banking on, isn't it?
Yes.
You've always known that I doubted your devotion to my son.
And I've never questioned his until now.
What's this?
You see, for years,
The Grayson men have had a little pied a Terre near the met.
And they've passed it down from generation to generation,
one after another have strutted around,
thinking their wives were clueless about their liaisons.
But we've always known if we wished to.
And we've passed that little card
to each new future Mrs. Grayson.
As a sort of wedding gift.
Well, I appreciate the gesture, Victoria,
but Daniel and I are nothing like you and Conrad.
We're more alike than you think.
Go on.
See for yourself.
Hello again, Mrs. Grayson.
It seems your son and his lady friend
have settled in for the night.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Anderson, can we get some more ice, please?
Right away, Mr. Grayson.
No.
That'll be all.
You alone?
Yeah. Daniel's in the city.
Good, 'cause I wanna talk to you. It's about your sister.
Okay.
Some guy stole her phone.
He was apparently blackmailing her with it.
Is she okay?
She's fine,
because your boyfriend beat the hell out of him in my bar.
Aiden did?
Brutally.
And I can see from your reaction that he hasn't told you.
Now you told me it's none of my business
what happens when this is all over.
But how well do you know Aiden?
I thought this was about my sister.
Where did you meet him?
We trained together.
We're a lot alike. He lost his family, too.
So I heard.
What do you want, Jack?
I wanna know that you know what you're doing.
Of course I do.
Would you even tell me if you didn't?
You were always secretive.
Even when we were kids, and you'd see a shooting star,
you'd never tell me what you wished for.
I realize now it's not because you didn't think
it was gonna come true. It's because...
you're afraid.
Of what?
Of letting people in.
You know, maybe I was a lot smarter then,
because had I not told you the truth, who I really am,
maybe you wouldn't hate me right now.
I could never hate you.
And not for lack of trying.
It's just, after seeing Aiden today, I...
I think you deserve more than you're getting.
You don't even know him.
And to be honest, you don't know me.
Not anymore.
You're right.
You wanna know what I used to wish for?
That nothing would ever change.
You didn't call first.
What if I had had company?
Well, looks like you already got rid of them.
Or you didn't.
Should I be concerned?
Turns out I didn't need to be inside Grayson manor
to play my part.
I borrowed Charlotte's laptop,
got her I.P. address, wi-fi code,
mummy's credit card details.
Now you tell me. But... that's everything we need
to set up Victoria as the buyer of the murder weapon.
I, uh, assume Emily knows you took advantage of her baby sis?
I merely took advantage of an opportunity
whilst helping Charlotte.
There was no need to pester Emily with the details.
Look, this isn't gonna be a thing, is it?
You giving me guilt about
how I need to openly communicate with my girlfriend?
No. I just--
Good,
because there's something I need you to do,
and it's incredibly important.
This stays between you and me.
"The choices we make"?
Daniel, uh, chose it.
Simple but profound,
considering the lesson I've been trying to pass down to him.
And what is that exactly?
Discretion...
is essential in all facets life.
You know, I may have single-handedly saved
Daniel's relationship with Emily.
I think that you might have some rewrites to do
once he calls off this wedding.
Are you still in denial
about how your transparent shower stunt backfired?
Oh, come on. I know you were rooting for the other woman.
Not surprising, considering you were one.
Mm. Thank god those days are over.
Hmm. Do you remember that terribly obvious bachelor pad you took me to?
Oh, I...
I got rid of that place years ago.
I'm all yours now, darlin'.
Pity.
We need to talk.
Me first.
But you already gave me a watch.
Well, this wasn't planned.
But before you open it,
I have something to confess to you, Daniel.
I followed you.
I saw you and Sara at the farmers' market yesterday.
After you left,
I confronted her.
And I broke down on that poor girl.
You know I trust you. I just...
couldn't get a hold of my emotions.
It was so unlike me that
I realized something else must be going on.
So I went to the doctor.
Are you okay?
I'm great.
As it turns out...
we're pregnant.
Look.
Hey. Sorry I missed you earlier.
You want to, uh, you wanna come by tonight?
I can't. I have a last minute meeting in the city.
That sounds mysterious.
It is.
Someone contacted me, claiming to know enough about Conrad
to fill a book of their own.
Probably some lunatic looking for cash.
After my disappointing chat
with Nolan Ross today,
my fervor for the story is dying.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, not if it means more time for nightcaps with you.
Good night, Jack.
Good night.
Ah, you made it.
Thanks for meeting with me, Ms. Davis.
It's Lydia.
And believe me, the pleasure is all mine.
