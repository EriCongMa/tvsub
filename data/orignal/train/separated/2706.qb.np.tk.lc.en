&quot; ltaly was relieved today upon learning ...
&quot; that the country &apos;s high court had ruled that influence peddling is not a crime .
&quot; said franco ferrarotti , an italian sociologist :
&quot; &apos; essentially , the judges are saying what everybody believes.&apos;
&quot; he was referring to raccomendazione ...
&quot; the italian custom of seeking special treatment from people in power .
&quot; &apos; this is our version of the protestant ethic , &apos; mr. ferrarotti said .
&quot; the case concerned a clerk of a civil court in potenza ...
&quot; who was jailed for promising to speed up someone &apos;s trial .
&quot; evidence showed that he received 88 pounds of fish ...
&quot; in return for his assistance . &quot;
hello . yeah , she &apos;s here .

you &apos;re complaining about your paper on ethnicity .
here &apos;s some interesting stuff from your own background .
we &apos;re from potenza ? i thought we were napoli @-@ daboli or whatever .
neapolitan . but this is about italy as a whole .
did the squirrels eat the bread
i put out for the ducks , or somebody sweep it up ?
i do know that meadow stepped in some soggy bread with her bare feet .
you should &apos;ve heard it .
what &apos;s that ?
this is the new york times that your friend here has delivered to him at school
for his social studies requirement ,
then he doesn &apos;t read them . i find them piled in his room .
make a go of it at that new school .
you got no idea what we did to get you in there .
there is no reason you shouldn &apos;t be able to pass social studies .
you passing social studies ?
you just revealed your own ignorance .
it &apos;s only been five days . we didn &apos;t get grades yet .
i what ? i revealed my own what ?
look at that .

i &apos;m just saying , i mean , i &apos;m glad to do it .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re glad .
you know , your father was like a mentor to me .
right .
a standup .
you ask anybody . your old man was a legend .
he single @-@ handedly hunted down that new england crew .
brought the war home to them up there .
another chevy .
nuns .
might be undercover feds , but i doubt it .
he must be colicky .
i think he likes your hair better that way .
mr. soprano .

melvoin &apos;s good .
we have to change our arrangement .
which arrangement is that ?
these fucking lawyers are taking my internal organs .
$ 1 million for this trial , melvoin and hirshorn are charging .
and that was bad enough .
now they put this harvard kid on , this lackey .
i don &apos;t know what the fuck he does .
and then they just decided we needed audibility experts to testify ...
you can &apos;t definitively state what people are saying on the government tapes .
i could fucking tell them that .
those guys , they got sound graphs and shit .
$ 50,000 , the cocksuckers are charging .
plus the minimization expert , plus the fucking monthly expenses .
fucking lexis fees , the xeroxing .
an entire northwest forest must &apos;ve given its life in xerox paper ...
for this one fucking trial .
i said to mel , &quot; can &apos;t we just at one fucking meeting ...
&quot; all read from the same sheet of paper ,
pass it around ? &quot; -our split stays the same .
you kept me in place as boss to take the heat off you .
my legal problems have let you go around
like a gabavreche ... two fucking years now .
there you go .
ten points .
i got medical bills , too , anthony .
i got cash flow problems of my own .
a one @-@ time hit , $ 50,000 , $ 75,000 to cover the audibility expert .
i got two kids in private schools .

you never know ,
i could be on the endangered species list .
chrissy .

that &apos;s more addictive than shooting .
i don &apos;t do it every fucking day now , like some people .
i &apos;m just chipping , i got it under control .
chrissy , tony loves you .
why would he have you made if he didn &apos;t depend on you ?
he can depend on me .

turn it down .
i &apos;m worried , tony .
about my weight ?
about money .
you &apos;re getting a little less allowance than usual . i told you , it &apos;s temporary .
super bowl last year , we didn &apos;t lay enough off .
no , it &apos;s not just that . i &apos;m worried about you ,
about the future ... about me and the kids , if something happens to you .
i don &apos;t provide for you ?

i saw angie bonpensiero today .
she was handing out free polish sausage at the supermarket .
don &apos;t start . i supported her . you &apos;re so worried about the money .
who is gonna support your children and me ...
if , god forbid , something happens to you ? that &apos;s the point .
sil ? paulie ? that is frightening .
you &apos;ll be taken care of .
you &apos;re set in perpetuity . there &apos;s money in overseas accounts .
i don &apos;t have the serial numbers .
you &apos;ll have them when the time comes .
not now . for your own benefit . so you &apos;re not an accomplice .
jesus christ , i been busting my pick all day long ...
to bring home the money you &apos;re so concerned about .
i thought maybe i could have a sundae and zone out in front of the frigging tv .
because , a : you &apos;re right , my job is extremely stressful ...
i am talking about some simple estate planning , tony , that &apos;s all .
my cousin , brian cammarata ,
has helped lots of people set up trusts for their kids ...
begin asset allocation ...
i got to spell this out for you ?
i can &apos;t declare x amount of my income .
your consulting fees from barone sanitation you do .
we file a tax return to justify the house , the cars .
we could put aside some of that to start a portfolio .
stocks ?
you gotta be high in the corporate structure to make that work .
we don &apos;t have those enron @-@ type connections .
bonds , then . there are these things called &quot; reits &quot; brian told me about .
bonds , where &apos;s the capital for that ?
in the caymans or under the mattress ...
or wherever you put it at zero growth .
the money stays put . with what &apos;s going on globally ...
there &apos;s always some excuse .
there &apos;s no cash in this house .
not since our last bust . check the vents .
and i provide for my children .
yes , tony , you do . but i don &apos;t know how you do it , because you won &apos;t tell me .
let me tell you something , or you can watch the fucking news :
everything comes to an end .

you &apos;re fucking arguing with me now ?
no , ton &apos; .
you don &apos;t see the monthly statements . we &apos;re hemorrhaging money out of here .
no , you &apos;re right , i don &apos;t .

ice ? no , i don &apos;t .
are you getting cute with me ?
no .
i think you are . you &apos;re getting a fucking attitude on you .

conserve .
where were you ?
i wanna know why there &apos;s zero growth in this family &apos;s receipts .

the boss of this family ... is on trial for his life .
and what you people are kicking up to him is a fucking disgrace .
you know how much lawyers cost ? a major rico like his ,

guy in there killed your father .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
barry haydu .
detective lieutenant in the clifton police force .
retired today .
that &apos;s his retirement party .
everybody always told me it was a fucking cop .
i thought he was dead .
my mother can &apos;t even talk about it .
did the hit for jilly ruffalo . him and your old man were in the can together .
jilly stabbed your old man &apos;s cellmate to death .
so , when your old man got paroled , he tracked down jilly .
took out his eye so bad , he couldn &apos;t even put a glass one in .
loyal , your old man .
that &apos;s what i heard .
some guy &apos;s eye .
they hit my dad right outside my house , right ?
he was bringing home a crib for me ?
yeah .
well , no ... he was outside the house , but he wasn &apos;t carrying a crib .
he had a bunch of tv trays . could &apos;ve been a crib just as easily .
that rat fuck was in uniform then .
gambled like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
he did it on contract . made a lot of money over the years .
so , how come he &apos;s still fucking walking ?
because he &apos;s been useful . but he &apos;s outlived it ...
as of his cute little ceremony this afternoon .
is that him ? with the sombrero on ?
no , you can &apos;t tell from here .
maybe ...
yeah , probably .
here .
nice house , apparently . they say he paid cash for it .
good luck .
questions ?
kill the dome light .
that &apos;s the lamest plan i ever heard .
it is not a lame plan , we got it all worked out .
and we got the time to place everything .
it &apos;s lame .
magnum , why are you being so negative and hostile ?
higgins , he &apos;s one of the biggest drug dealers in the midwest ...
and he &apos;s as dangerous as quenneville ...
what the fuck is this ? you &apos;re cleaned out . nothing to rob in this place .
well , there &apos;s this .
okay .
you know i &apos;m a police officer .
engraving on this watch says you retired today .
every little bit helps .

yeah .
how &apos;s that steak ?
it &apos;s okay .
hon ?
another steak san over here . rare .

you know , because it &apos;s ... it &apos;s a lot of added responsibility .
i think it should &apos;ve happened sooner .
how &apos;s your family doing , you know ... since the tragedy with your dad ?
rough on my mother .
how old is she now ?
she &apos;s 69 .
mom really went downhill after the world trade center .
you know , quasimodo predicted all this .
who did what ?
these problems .
the middle east , the end of the world .
nostradamus .
quasimodo &apos;s the hunchback of notre dame .
right . notre damus .
nostradamus , and notre dame .
it &apos;s two different things completely .
it &apos;s interesting , though , they &apos;d be so similar , isn &apos;t it ?
and i always thought , &quot; okay , hunchback of notre dame .
&quot; you also got your quarterback and halfback of notre dame . &quot;
one &apos;s a fucking cathedral .
obviously . i know , i &apos;m just saying .
it &apos;s interesting , the coincidence .
what , you gonna tell me you never pondered that ?
the back thing with notre dame ?
no !
look , i don &apos;t know who told you i had anything to do with your father &apos;s death ...
but their information is faulty ...
or they are deliberately not telling you the truth .
are you inferring that you didn &apos;t take cash from jilly ruffalo ...
to whack my father while he was carrying a tv tray for me to watch tv ?
i don &apos;t know anybody named ruffalo .
you &apos;re being set up ! he &apos;s lying to you , whoever he is .
it wouldn &apos;t make any difference .
what do you mean , it wouldn &apos;t make any difference ?
he wants you dead .
all right , look . i got a boat .
it &apos;s a sea ray 230 . it &apos;s almost brand new .
i didn &apos;t kill your father , but you could ...
you don &apos;t want a cop @-@ kill on your head !
... and what if they won &apos;t pull over , t.c. ?
i &apos;m not gonna take on a limo in this car .
no problem .
i &apos;m sorry !
what are you gonna do ?
honk the horn .
pull over ! police !
police , in a ferrari ?
freeze ! don &apos;t move a muscle , or i &apos;ll put a bullet through it .
special investigator finaday , you &apos;re under arrest .
what &apos;s the charge , officer ?
speeding , reckless driving , endangering another vehicle ...
and impersonating an officer .
how do you think it &apos;s going ?
couldn &apos;t be better , you two are terrific .
soon as they come through the door , we &apos;re gonna nail them .
freeze !
shit .
i missed my game , again .
fucking loser .
now reese &apos;ll have to lead the guys to victory .
who &apos;s reese ?
kenneth reese !
he was my back @-@ up quarterback at the academy ...
and he &apos;s been waiting for a chance like this since 1963 .
now he &apos;s got it because of you .
... more than 12 hours . ted ?
amy , in pennsylvania tonight , two men were shot and killed ...
in what was described as a brazen but successful armored @-@ car robbery .
three accomplices escaped with $ 800,000 ...
while one of the dead men , dennis lynch of freehold , new jersey ...
was said by police to have ties to organized crime families ...
both in that city and in new york .
the street where the robbery took place ...
was littered with bills of denominations from ...
you smell gas down here ?
it &apos;s always like that .
you had the pipes checked ?
i thought i heard something .
is he up ? i need to talk to him .
i brought him a steak . you can put it with eggs .
actually , your wife &apos;s here . she &apos;s making him something to eat .
karen . did something happen ?
we got some bad news last night .
are you just gonna stand there ?
the feds had an undercover agent in dr. schreck &apos;s office .
uncle jun &apos; .
hey , karen .
fucking grand central station ?
junior , my kids ?
you &apos;re right . sorry , dear .
i brought my bar of soap .
what time they call you ?
we had a little scare . thought it was the shunt in his heart .
he passed some gas , and he seems better .
why don &apos;t you go on joe franklin , tell the whole tri @-@ state area ?
dad .
not now .
i heard what happened .
it &apos;s bad , but it &apos;s not worth getting yourself sick over .
i told you , just sit down .
he doesn &apos;t have cable .
actually , we &apos;re gonna go . okay , jun &apos; , you got everything ?
thank you , dear , you &apos;ve been wonderful .
bye , karen .
i &apos;ll see you . see you , kids .
i &apos;ll see you . see you , kids .
must &apos;ve been that piece of tail .
now , look , she ...
she probably reported the meetings ... who was there , all that shit .
as far as conversations , what could she hear ?
you &apos;d better hope nothing ... because you were involved in every fucking one .
how could you fall for that flirty shit ? that &apos;s the point !
get the hell outta here . i wanna talk to my uncle .
forget about that for a minute . that shit about your legal expenses .
i been thinking , and okay .
maybe i can give you some relief .
what ?
you got that empty garage over on frelinghuysen avenue .
you been trying to sell it . i &apos;ll take it off your hands .
what are you gonna do with it ?
i don &apos;t know , i &apos;m trying to help you out .
how much ?
$ 100,000 .
who gives a fuck anyway ?
come on .
i was led around by the nose , anthony .
you &apos;re right . a young cooze smiled at me , and birds started chirping .
time was , my instincts would &apos;ve never failed me like that .
so , what are you now , the amazing kreskin ?
what did i tell her ? did i say anything could be used against me ?
i don &apos;t know .
bullshitting , singing .
atlantic city , jesus christ .
i &apos;ll be sitting right across from her in the courtroom .
all right , come on . have something to eat .
i &apos;m an old man , anthony .
an old man that &apos;s going to trial .
not much else to say about me .
i &apos;m a little depressed .
you were on vacation .
can you describe the feelings ?
things are good .
especially with carmela .
but then she starts ragging on me about the future .
how she &apos;s worried .
and what &apos;s gonna happen to them if i &apos;m dead .
and &quot; buy bonds &quot; and all this shit .
a lot of people are feeling vulnerable .
on the other hand , she &apos;s right .
not that i &apos;d ever tell her that .
why not ?
&apos;cause then she &apos;d wanna know where &apos;s the money , how much .
don &apos;t you want carmela to be taken care of ?
she is . anyway , she &apos;s right , that &apos;s the point .
over the last few years , i &apos;ve been doing a lot of thinking .
and ?
my uncle definitely snapped it into focus .
what &apos;s he , 72 years old ? what &apos;s he got ?
fucking shitty house in belleville , and a bunch of legal bills ...
that &apos;d make you gargle drano if you had them .
i &apos;ve analyzed it .
there &apos;s two endings for a guy like me .
high @-@ profile guy . dead , or in the can .
big percent of the time .
you &apos;ve never talked this frankly .
even with all this terrorism shit , the government has resources up the ass .
as far as legal bills are ...
anthony !
what ?
why don &apos;t you give it up ?
you didn &apos;t let me finish .
there &apos;s a third way to wrap it up .
you rely only on family .
not many men could survive without the love and support ...
of their wife and children .
no , i &apos;m talking about business .
you trust only blood .
a friend of mine ... guy whose name you wouldn &apos;t know ...
stayed out of the can and in charge .
lived in florida till he was 81 years old . he only gave orders through his son .
no other conversations that could come back in testimony .
his son ?
no , not a.j.
what i &apos;ve been dealt is my nephew .
he &apos;s gotten his act together , the kid .
over the last few months ...
i started the process of bonding him to me inseparably .
how ?
that we can &apos;t get into .
didn &apos;t your uncle do that with you ? you said his life is like a desert .
i &apos;m 42 , and i &apos;m already more successful than my uncle ever was .
you &apos;ve seen my house .
anthony , why are you telling me this ?
i don &apos;t know .
guess
i trust you .
a little .
hi , mom .
what the hell are you doing here ? you scared me to death .
just stopped by to see how you &apos;re getting along .
you ever do anything like a normal person ? there is a bell .
how you been ?
fine .
how &apos;s connie &apos;s kid ?
he &apos;s huge .
jesus !
that &apos;s jason ?
he has a weight problem already . eight years old .
she never had him baptized . she thought she knew everything .
actually , i was hoping you would make me one of your fluffernutters .
it &apos;s fucking mouthwash .
leave me the fuck alone . you come over here with that shit .
what &apos;s that on the table , daddy &apos;s navy picture ?
you ever miss him ?
when he was in prison ...
or since he &apos;s been dead ?
i don &apos;t know .
did i saddle you with a stepfather ?
i don &apos;t have any peanut butter . i haven &apos;t kept it since you left .
i can &apos;t make you a fluffernutter .
you want french toast ?
i gotta go .
ade sends her love .
right , say hello .
you watch that bailey &apos;s , or i &apos;ll give you a shot in the head .
look who &apos;s talking .
what ?
