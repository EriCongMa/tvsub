第二季第二十集
闲人免进
Plot 332. This is it.
Hey, what's going on here?
Lose the shovel.
Keep your hands where I can see them.
What are you doing here?
You're going to be so pretty.
I had the photo enhanced.
It's a rough extrapolation of features
since the face was almost entirely blown out.
I ran it through every FBI database
from facial recognition, mug shots, surveillance feeds --
Or I could just buy this boat, and we could disappear.

Do you know how many images are in the NGI database?
51 million.
If we go away, none of that matters.
51 million, and not a single one of her.
Reddington knows who she is.
I know who she is.
That girl -- that's me.
And the woman -- I believe that may be my mother.
That mean Reddington's your dad?
No.
My father died when I was 4, in a fire.
Reddington was there.
I think she may have been, too.
Why don't you just ask him?
If Reddington wanted me to know the truth,
he would have told me by now.
He wants to keep me from knowing,
and he will bully anyone who might help me into silence.
Well, that's his tell -- the silence.
Berlin had me keep tabs on him, or try to.
The mere mention of his name
was like I'd asked for their first born.
He thinks the fear protects him,
but the fear he instills --
silence can't hide it.
You can see it in their eyes.
Whenever I did,
I knew Reddington had been there.
What?
That stamp.
The...ring -- I've seen it before.
Where?
Berlin.
He wore a ring with that exact hallmark.
It's a Russian inspection stamp.
You know people who worked with Berlin.
You could reach out.
My apologies, Leonard. I intended to be earlier.
You had a bullet removed from your chest five days ago.
It's a wonder you're here at all.
I've configured an optical character recognition program
to create hard copies of the data of the Fulcrum.
That data's over 25 years old. Much of it must be obsolete.
Most of the key delegations are run by the same players.
The Director believes there are too many players on the board.
He thinks a bipolar world is inherently more stable.
Whatever they're planning to accomplish,
it won't commence until 2017.
Well, he's advancing the timeline.
And with Hobbs gone, I've lost my man on the inside.
We need to find Kenneth Jasper.
He's one of the Director's closest allies.
He'll know what they're planning.
I threatened to kill him when he betrayed Roger Hobbes.
More specifically, I threatened to cut out his tongue
and deliver it to the Director personally.
He won't be easy to find.
But he's the best play.
Swanky digs.
Seeing as how you recently paid a visit
to my apartment in Bethesda,
you know I have a fondness for the old and somewhat decrepit.
Dembe asked me to go to get the interface for the Fulcrum.
He needed you to get the Fulcrum.
He wanted you to discover secrets.
Did you discover any secrets, Lizzy?
What's that?
Please, help yourself.
Identification documents for Lien Mah.
Fake birth certificate. Fake passport.
Death certificate.
Proof of embalming.
Everything necessary to convince the U.S. State Department
that Lien Mah was a Chinese national
who died while visiting the United States
and to arrange for her body's return to her homeland.
Who would ship a fictitious Chinese corpse to China?
A rather clever smuggler, I imagine.
So, if Lien Mah is fake,
then whose body are they shipping overseas?
"Marjorie Lin, 24, was laid to rest monday afternoon.
Not 10 hours later, her body was stolen
in a brazen midnight grave robbery."
You think the smuggler is using Marjorie Lin's body?
Compare the photo on Lien Mah's false passport
to the photo of Marjorie Lin in the paper.
Same woman.
But why this case? What's your angle?
This smuggler also has business with the Cabal.
The Cabal?
The Taiwan festival bombing in 2011.
32 dead, 9 injured.
The I.E.D. that took out the convoy
headed to the Chinese consulate in Jakarta last year --
Another 17 dead.
Both were engineered by the Cabal.
And this same smuggler was used to transport
those explosives to their final destinations.
You want to target one of their assets?
I went to the Director,
showed him the Fulcrum, restored the détente.
The détente is over, Lizzy.
What you know about the Fulcrum --
what the Director now knows you know --
by saving me, you revealed yourself
to be a potent enemy,
a target they will try to discredit or destroy.
The smuggler. We need to find the smuggler.
So, we obtained a list from State
of all the foreign nationals who died on U.S. soil
and were repatriated back to their home countries.
Of these, seven in particular stood out.
How so?
Their passports were forged
using fictitious names just like the documentation
that Mr. Reddington provided on Marjorie Lin.
And who were these women, really?
Marjorie Lin, a.k.a. Lien Mah,
wasn't the only body that was stolen.
We were able to match the seven forged photographs
with seven grave robberies
in which the bodies were Asian females under 35 --
Chinese, to be specific.
And all of them were shipped back to various cities in China.
Do we know who received the shipments on the other end?
I contacted the Chinese authorities.
They're launching an investigation.
I doubt they'll come up with much.
I mean, given the elaborately forged paper trails,
my bet is these funeral parlors don't even exist.
Based on this guy's track record,
there's a good chance he was moving explosives
in those caskets.
And we'll find out.
As soon as our suspect files the paperwork
authorizing the transportation of Lien Mah back to China,
we'll know the flight number,
and we can go seize the casket and see for ourselves.
That's enough for today.
Just one more lap, Raymond.
This is an important part of your therapy.
You should have let me die, Dembe.
Nobody told me about this aimless walking.
Jasper's gone.
How gone?
Canceled all meetings and fled in his gulfstream four days ago.
Bogus flight plan. No record of any visas issued.
Not as much as a passport swiped.
Dembe, call Alex and Barton.
Book them a flight to Key West.
Jasper's yacht is docked at the Admiral's Club Marina --
A Banetti Romanza.
Arrivederci Bella.
Barton can pass for Jasper from a distance.
Go aboard, take her out a mile or two,
blow her up.
Dembe will make it appear to be a death by misadventure.
Tip off Frasier at the Journal
and Brenda Short at Holford Capital.
Stock in Jasper's conglomerate, Century View Media,
will start hemorrhaging as soon as news
of his tragic disappearance goes viral.
Within hours, he'll have to hold a press conference
to stem the bleeding.
And then we'll have his location,
or at least a starting point.
And if he decides to ride it out?
He has two viciously rapacious ex-wives,
a Brazilian bull shark of a mistress,
and a thoroughbred ranch south of Ocala
that's a bottomless money pit.
He'll turn up.
If you're gonna keep stopping by like this,
perhaps we should consider getting you an office.
I'm getting sworn in tomorrow, Harold.
I'm aware. Big day.
You're damn right.
And I've been getting calls from
the Times, from the Post.
There were witnesses.
People think it was Reddington who was shot.
People know it was him.
We can deal with rumors.
What's harder to deal with is proof,
and there isn't any.
The press believes a fugitive from the FBI's most want list
was here in D.C.
And it looks like I don't know anything about it.
It gives the impression
I'm more focused on transitioning into the job
than doing the job.
I want this handled.
How do you suggest I do that?
There's a reporter at the Post.
His name is Josh Mandell.
I want you to leak him something,
anything.
A redacted operational report to Reven Wright --
Just enough to convey that my office and the FBI
are all over the Reddington case.
You're asking me to fabricate and then leak
a classified document.
Yes.
It's public relations, Harold.
Lien Mah's body was just delivered to Dulles.
The casket's scheduled to be on flight 241 to Beijing.
Contact airport authority. Stop that flight.
Make sure the casket doesn't make it to the cargo hold.
Get an E.O.D. team to meet us on site.
I just heard from Reddington. Uh, he wants to meet.
About what?
He won't say. He's still worried about leaks.
I'll have to catch up with you later.
Our preliminary X-rays didn't reveal
any explosive material
or objects with a density
common to C-4 or other incendiary plastics.
We won't know what we got for sure till we get inside.
To be safe, we're gonna let the robot crack it.
That's definitely Marjorie Lin.
Interior looks clear.
That's not possible.
Our intel says that something's being smuggled
out of the country in that casket.
What if what we're looking for isn't in the casket?
What if he's brazen enough
to hide the contraband in the body itself?
We're not gonna open that body.
No one here wants to put this woman through
anything more than she's already endured,
but I'm afraid we're going to have to insist.
You know,
when I was a, uh -- when I was a kid,
I wanted to race motorcycles, and my mom said,
"No, Jeffrey. Go into medicine.
It's safe."
Thanks a lot, mom.
All right. Here we go. Helmet on.
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
Okay. Definitely should not have had tuna for lunch.
Wish me luck.
Okay.
Here we go. Nice and easy.
Nice...and easy.
All right.
Okay, I'm gonna open her up by
cutting along the path of the previous incision.
Here we go.
I'm in.
All of the internal organs appear normal, post-embalmment.
Nothing here appears to be out of the ordinary.
She's clean. In fact, she's immaculate.
This is one of the most impeccably preserved bodies
I have ever seen.
We're clear.
Did the same thing last month.
It's probably why you don't recognize me.
Konstantin.
Berlin, man, he's tough.
I had to get away for a while,
go to Germany, figure a few things out.
I come here for the peace and quiet.
Sure. Sorry.
Gosh, you know, I just thought maybe you could help me.
He said to piss off, pal.
Just take a minute.
I don't know who that is.
I think you do.
Why don't you take another look?
We got a problem.
Let him go!
You okay?
Yeah.
I believe he was asking for a name.
I can't. I swore on my life I wouldn't.
You sore to whom?
Son of a bitch.
Who's Bill Kershaw?
Where is it? I know it's here.
That's how you knew I was here,
how you knew I saw the picture.
It's why you threated people.
The important thing is for our stockholders to understad
that I am alive and well.
And we understand
that you've lined up a series of interviews
so that you can reassure...
Call Hollenbeck in Boston.
I want a surveillance team outside that station
when Jasper leaves.
I suppose we should find out from Dr. Renovitch
if I'm cleared to fly.
Where are you? Where are you? Where are you?
Raymond.
...want to be reassured that company is stable.
Hello, Mr. Kershaw.
I saw your name on the mailbox.
I know you're listening. You know how I know?
Because this
is where you keep all of your secrets.
And you don't want anyone finding those out, do you?
Well, unless you answer my questions,
I'm gonna find every last one.
Let me have your phone.
You've made your point, Agent Keen.
It's time we discuss the photograph.
The girl is you.
And the woman is your mother.
What was her name?
I knew her as Katarina Rostova.
One of her many names.
She was a KGB agent.
The girl...
The night of the fire, they called her --
Masha.
You were born in Moscow.
Your parents -- uh, father and --
They were both in foreign intelligence.
You said she died of weakness and shame.
Yeah.
You were there that night. I need to know what happened.
You want to know.
There's a difference.
Dr. Orchard told me someone blocked my memory of that night.
Was it you?
Yes.
Why?
I'm not going to tell you.
You have a picture of my mother in your weird, little apartment.
Why?
Were you in love with her?
Is that why my father died?
You killed him because you were in love with my mother?
Tell me what happened. Please.
I'm not gonna tell you what happened, Lizzy.
Then I'll find out for myself.
What's on your mind?
Tom Connolly
wants me to leak intel to the press.
What kind of intel?
Classified.
I should have said no,
but I get the distinct impression
that my position in this clinical trial
is contingent on doing him favors.
So, do them.
I mean, don't people leak information all the time?
You hear what I said?
He's leveraging my health, my life.
Harold, you're a decent man
the man I fell in love with,
and now you're asked to do something indecent.
But if you are telling me that your life depends on
whether Tom Connolly gets what he wants,
you know my opinion.
I do.
And you know mine.
Reddington said that the smugglers facilitated
several terrorist incidents in the past.
He had to have been transporting something in that casket.
Well, it wasn't drugs or explosives.
Maybe it was the stolen bodies themselves.
Guys, come here. Check this out.
The photo on the left was taken by the coroner
who pronounced Marjorie Lin dead five days ago.
The one on the right was taken at the airport yesterday.
Notice anything?
Their teeth are different.
Bingo.
When she died, Marjorie Lin didn't have veneers.
Her teeth were fixed postmortem?
That is not easy to pull off, given the time frame.
Process normally takes weeks.
Ms. Lin's body was only taken two days ago.
According to Danover labs,
the order was delivered to a Dr. Henry McGlasson.
Now, I dug a little deeper into this guy
and contacted the medical board.
They did have an address -- 3230 Kettering Drive.
How'd it go with Reddington? Did he have any insights?
No. But I did.
My face is out there.
I've done five interviews in the last four hours.
The reporting has been corrected.
It'll just take time for the share price to recover.
The front desk called. The radio people are here.
Put Theelan on it.
Tell him to flog his boy from the S.E.C. and get it done!
We'll be wheels up again in two hours.
I'll do the video uplink in the air.
Hello, Kenneth!
Regrettably, your interview has been canceled,
but don't fret.
I'm quite certain my questions will be much more provocative.
FBI. Hands where I can see them.
You're standing in front of a ghost bride.
Come again. A what?
It's an outlawed folk custom.
A Chinese form of ancestor worship.
When a family member dies, the surviving relatives
are obligated to tend to that person's needs in the afterlife.
And if they die unmarried,
they'll find themselves alone on the other side.
And unhappy spirits tend to come back
and haunt their living relatives.
Well, what are the paper dolls for?
The ceremony.
The family crafts a doll for the deceased groom, as well.
After which, the female's remains
are buried alongside the deceased male.
Believe it or not, even with all the women in China,
young, attractive, unmarried female corpses are rare,
which would explain why our suspect
was exporting bodies from the U.S.
I'm sorry, but this guy digs up bodies in America,
and then he sends them back to China to be re-buried?
Mail-order corpse brides.
Selected based on age, lineage, education, attractiveness.
And that explains the veneers.
This one was clearly crafted to resemble Marjorie Lin.
Same general features, but it begs the question --
who's this one?
They're gonna steal another body.
Agent Navabi, I imagine you're knee-deep
in pilfered corpses at the moment,
but right now I require a woman
with your particular experience and training.
What?
There must be over $100,000 in this case.
Heads up, Kenneth.
I'm afraid I mean quite literay.
I'm gonna need you to keep your head up for this next part.
It's bad news, old boy. I know.
A few days ago, I offered to crown you king,
and now here you sit.
Well, the road not taken.
This is Agent Navabi.
She was trained by Mossad
in enhanced interrogation techniques.
I thought you two should have a little visit.
Why don't we get started?
I analyzed the money you found in the ceiling tile
and found a couple of anomalies.
Turns out the cash is worth a lot more
than the 100 grand the bills represent.
How is that even possible?
All the serial numbers start with a888,
and none of them include the number 4.
In, uh, Cantonese and most regional Chinese dialects,
the word for "four" sounds like the Chinese word for "death."
So, fours are unlucky.
What does that have to do with the bills?
It is statistically impossible to have this many bills
and not have any fours,
unless, of course, the bills were printed specifically
without any fours.
So you're saying that they're counterfeit.
I'm saying they're prosperity notes,
worth about 5 bucks to every dollar.
And there's only one place you can buy an entire batch of currency
with this sort of customized detail.
Whoever paid the suspect
bought the prosperity notes from the U.S. Treasury.
If we can trace who bought the bills,
we might be able to I.D. the next client.
I already contacted the Treasury.
The buyer was one Mr. Chaoxiang Han.
Uh, Kenda.
Uh, I looked into this guy, and -- thanks so much --
and we found this article published last February.
"Mr. and Mrs. Chaoxiang Han
mourned the loss of only son Jin,
the heir apparent to the Han tech empire,
worth billions."
Says he committed suicide after he was left at the altar
by his fiancee, An Bai,
after which she emigrated to D.C. to live with her father.
He works at the embassy.
She's currently attending Georgetown.
An Bai is the next victim.
Uh, wait, but isn't she supposed to already be dead?
Isn't that how this works?
Uh, the parents must blame her for Jin's suicide.
They're determined to make An Bai his bride,
if not in life, then in death.
You two head to An Bai's.
Get me the security office at Georgetown.
Oh, my Goodness.
Remember that fantastic film
from the '70s -- "Marathon Man"?
Oh, my God, what a film.
Laurence Olivier as the ex-NAZI
super-bad guy/dentist.
And Dustin Hoffman as --
uh, I think he was a graduate student, wasn't he?
Anyway, that interrogation scene --
Oh, my Gosh.
Olivier drilling into Hoffman's teeth
right down into the nerve.
Oh, God, I can just feel it!
The screaming and writhing, the sound of the drill.
And of course, Hoffman delirious with pain,
saying anything, true or not,
just to stop the excruciating nightmare.
"Is it safe?" "Yes, it's safe."
"Is it safe?" "No, no, it's not safe!"
You know, he'd say anything.
And then that, uh, uh, guy comes in -- what's his name?
The -- with the great teeth and that hair --
Anyway, nothing much comes of it.
Hoffman doesn't know anything, but what a scene.
Unfortunately, nothing quite so dramatic today.
We're gonna be a little more businesslike.
That Novocaine Agent Navabi just gave you
should be starting to kick in right about now.
So, here's our plan.
You're gonna tell us what sort of mass-casualty event
or events the Director is planning.
Either you answer our questions,
or we're gonna yank out all your teeth today.
I told you. I don't know.
The Director never spoke of his plans with me.
I'm not in the loop on operational details.
I don't believe that.
I offered you an opportunity
to elevate your position within the Cabal, Kenneth.
You declined and instead remained loyal to the Director.
I assumed you had greater aspirations,
but you don't, do you, Kenneth?
You rejected my offer because, as it turns out,
you're quite satisfied with your station.
That's how I know you're one of the primary decision makers.
Clearly, you are very much in the loop.
You don't understand my loyalty, do you?
Because you have nothing in your life
worth staying loyal to.
William Devane!
It was William Devane
with those marvelous teeth and that great hair!
Ohh, I love William Devane.
Anyway, that said,
dentistry makes me a little queasy,
so I'll leave you and my lovely associate
to the business at hand.
Look at me.
Sir, we don't have much time.
We need to move quickly before he comes back.
I have orders from the Director to get you out of here.
Stay behind me and keep quiet.
Stop!
Get in the car. Go.
I've scrambled the local P.D. to An Bai's house.
They should get there before you do.
Were you able to reach her?
No answer on her cell.
I'm gonna try her on her home line now.
For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
Corinthians.
Where are we going?
I have orders to take you to the Director.
I was aware we had someone on the inside,
but I just didn't know who.
Well, I'm not on the inside anymore.
I just blew my cover to save you.
It took me nine months to get Reddington
and that damn task force to trust me.
Look, the Director won't take any chances.
If he thinks I've divulged any information in their plans,
I am done.
I need you to make it clear that I didn't break.
I wasn't there the entire time.
I don't know what you said before Reddington brought me in.
Nothing. That's why Reddington brought you in.
He knows the Director is advancing the timeline.
He knows that the plan is to trigger a series of events
that will bring us to the brink of another world war.
I didn't tell him that. It was Leonard Caul.
Reddington has the Fulcrum,
which means he has a blueprint outlining
our entire infrastructure.
If you leaked operational details, we're done.
I didn't. I don't even have those details.
I know we're targeting a defense installation,
but I don't know which one.
I'm serious!
The Director won't finalize his choice until next week.
Then you have nothing to worry about.
Why are we...?
Where are you taking me? This isn't...
In Corinthians,
Satan wasn't transformed into an angel of light.
He was disguised as one.
Don't look so glum, Kenneth.
You just spent 10 minutes being ridden hard by Agent Navab.
I'd die for five.
Hello?
Ms. Bai?
My name is Aram Mojtabai, and I'm an agent with the FBI.
We have reason to believe you're in danger.
What are you talking about?
I'll explain, but first,
I need you to find a secure room in your house.
Make sure all the doors and windows are locked.
The police are on their way,
and I'm gonna stay on the line until they arrive.
Ms. Bai. Hello?
Ms. Bai? Hello? Hello, are you still there?
Ms. Bai?
53 to dispatch. We're here at the location.
Doesn't seem to be anyone home.
Hang on.
Hands! Show me hands!
Step out of the car.
You don't have any idea what you've done, do you?
You're the one charged with a dozen felonies, Mr. Zhang.
You're the one who almost took a woman's life today.
And how many lives did you take?
This tradition in Chinese culture
that you think is just some ghost story
with no basis in the real world.
But this -- this is the real world.
You were in a fire?
My older brother died when he was only 27.
I'm sorry.
My brother -- he was unmarried.
And in the years to follow,
he haunted my family from the grave.
My father worked for the same factory for 32 years.
They closed down four months after my brother's death.
And the bad luck that followed was...
our home was destroyed by a catastrophic fire.
My mother and father did not survive.
I sat with my mother in the hospital the day she passed.
Saw the fear in her eyes.
She said, "You know why this happened.
It will never stop until you appease your brother."
So that night,
I stole the body of a young woman from our village,
buried her alongside my brother.
A wife for him, a husband for her in the next life.
And from that day on, the bad luck was gone.
Just like my brother haunted me,
Jin Han haunts his parents now.
Because of you, he's not appeased.
And now he will bring bad luck
to those who have denied his happiness in the next life.
That includes you and your fellow agents.
We know you don't work exclusively
as an independent operator.
Your skill as an international smuggler
has made you quite valuable.
Valuable? To who?
To an organization some call the Cabal.
I don't know what that is.
You may not know the name,
but you know who hired you to procure the weapon
used in the Taiwanese festival bombing.
Or the convoy hit in Jakarta.
I'm listening.
There's going to be an attack on U.S. soil next week.
You were contracted to bring an item into the country,
something we believe will be instrumental in that attack.
We need to know what it is and when it's coming.
You're wrong.
We're not wrong. We know you were contracted.
Not about that.
I was called to arrange a delivery,
but not for an item.
It was an agent -- the one they call Karakurt.
Karakurt? Who is that?
And he's not arriving next week.
He's already here.
You see, Agent Keen,
your bad luck is already beginning.
I need a minute.
I'm out.
I'm not leaking classified data, not for you, not for anybody.
You're out? Out of what?
Whatever the hell kind of game it is you and I are playing.
You know I'm ill.
I came to you for help, as a friend.
And I thought that you offered that help as a friend.
I did.
Enough games, Tom.
You used it to leverage me,
to hold it over my head as a way to guarantee my assistance
whenever you decide you need it.
You think I pulled strings trying to save your life
for my own personal benefit?
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.
Oh, I'll do better than that, Harold.
I'll look you in the eye and tell you you're not even close.
The situation is much, much worse than you think.
You're absolutely right.
I helped you to get close, to get leverage, but not for me.
Buddy, come on. We're done with the games.
I'm sure a smart guy like you
can guess who's calling my plays.
The Cabal.
A quaint term that no one actually involved
would ever use.
Why me?
If you...
guys are as powerful as I'm told,
what the hell do you need me for?
All in good time, Harold.
What matters now is that you realize one key thing...
that you understand it and internalize it
with every fiber of your being.
And that is?
We own you.
You perjured yourself to protect Agent Keen.
You broke federal law
by disclosing the timeline of a pending indictment.
If that weren't enough,
a classified document was leaked today to the Post.
I told you I won't do it.
You're not understanding me, Harold.
It's already done.
It seems your wife doesn't share your ethical principles.
You wouldn't do it,
so Charlene made the hard decision for you.
That's how much she loves you.
God knows my wife wouldn't commit any felonies for my behalf.
I'm sure you're thinking up all of the moves you have left.
Careful.
The people I speak for won't hesitate to hurt you
or her if they need to.
So, what now?
Like I said, all will soon be revealed.
Come on.
I think they're, uh, almost ready to start.
A package arrived for you. It was flagged by security.
I think you need to see it for yourself.
I had a little chat with Jasper today.
Turns out he wasn't very good at holding his tongue,
so I thought I'd give you a shot at it.

♬Is the throw of a stone♬
♬How are you supposed to know♬
♬How you are supposed to go♬
Come in.
♬So you take to living♬
You want to talk about it?
♬Living is all you've got♬
♬Dodge the fake and Fiending♬
♬And all the things you're not♬
