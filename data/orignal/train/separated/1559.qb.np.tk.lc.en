this is awkward .
i don &apos;t have anymore money if that &apos;s what you mean .
sarah , we haven &apos;t heard from you yet .
i think my third foster home &apos;s a match .
the olmsteads have really gone out of their way to make me feel welcome .
i saw your shots on instagram .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m gonna say this once :
stop asking questions and stay the hell away from sarah .
do you think our moms are telling the riveras
they bought lexi the pill ?
what ?
lexi wanted my help getting the morning @-@ after pill
after she and jesus had sex .
i knew that you felt a responsibility to lexi &apos;s parents
because you are her vice principle .
i did it so that you did not have to .
how generous .
mari , jesus is gonna join us at church retreat next weekend .
why don &apos;t you come ?
what ?
you &apos;re gonna let them spend the night together
when you know they &apos;re having sex ?
save it , mariana , i don &apos;t want to hear it .
you &apos;re a freakin &apos; tattletale .
you &apos;re like some hurt little girl on the playground .
&quot; jesus and lexi had sex and i feel left out ,
so i &apos;m gonna tell on them . &quot;
it &apos;s the same thing you guys did to me .
yeah , what world is that the same thing ?
you guys were sneaking around
behind my back , lying to me .
because we knew you were gonna get your feelings hurt .
no . you knew what you were doing was messed up ,
or you wouldn &apos;t have been hiding it .
don &apos;t lie , jesus . you know it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
if that &apos;s the way it &apos;s gonna be , if we &apos;re keeping score now ,
maybe i should just tell moms who you &apos;ve been talking to .
jesus , shut up .
i think they &apos;d be very interested to know
you &apos;ve been giving ana money .
that would just get you in trouble , too , and you know it .
what do i care ? what are they gonna do , ground me ?
the only person i wanna see is lexi ,
and her parents won &apos;t let her talk to me .
sucks , doesn &apos;t it ?
i haven &apos;t been able to talk to her for weeks .
hey ! that is enough , you two !
you guys are gonna have to figure this out .
for better or for worse , you &apos;re a family ,
and you &apos;re gonna have to find a way to get along .
no one on this earth can get along with her ,
not even the dalai freakin &apos; lama
could get along with a monster like her .
i &apos;m sorry to say this , babe ,
but you kind of brought this on yourself .
drinking like that and outing your brother and lexi
to her parents was , uh ,
that was really none of your business .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re taking their side .
you might as well adopt lexi .
you like her so much better than me .
that is not true and you know it .
we love you more than anything .
we just don &apos;t love the way you &apos;ve been acting .
is this really who you wanna be ?
演唱者 kari kimmel
so what &apos;s up ?
well , i got a call yesterday from dr. kodema .
the therapist ?
from your group , yes .
and she expressed some concern
that while you have been showing up every week ,
you haven &apos;t really been participating .
yeah . um ...
i was gonna ask you , actually ...
yeah .
can we , maybe , find another group ?
why ? don &apos;t you like dr. kodema ?
yeah , she &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s just ... the kids .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t feel ... very comfortable .
huh . ok .
well , i can talk to bill about it ,
but therapy is one of the terms of your probation .
so until we can get something else worked out ,
you &apos;re gonna have to ...
keep going .
yeah .
ok .
hey , do you want some ?
is there juice ?
are you , like , not talking to me or something ?
no . why ?
i don &apos;t know , &apos; cause you &apos;re kind of not talking to me .
did i do something ?
i don &apos;t know . um , you took my sister
to a rager and got her drunk .
first of all , i didn &apos;t take mariana anywhere . she took me .
she took you ? to wyatt &apos;s party ?
yeah . she was whining about being around
when lexi and her parents came over .
and second , i told her not to drink , and she ignored me .
so if you wanna be pissed at someone , take it up with her .
sorry .
it &apos;s fine , don &apos;t worry about it .
i just thought that maybe ...
yeah , i know what you thought .

you used to love that song when you were little .
so how are you doing ?
a lot better .
i &apos;ve been clean for like a week now .
that &apos;s great .
yep .
and there &apos;s this place that i can go ,
this treatment center ,
to stay that way .
the problem is ,
i can &apos;t afford it .
i wish i could help , but i don &apos;t ...
i don &apos;t have any more money .
no , if you don &apos;t have any cash , that &apos;s cool .
i mean , there probably is something at your house ,
something that you guys don &apos;t use ,
something that your moms wouldn &apos;t miss .
and then you can give that to me and i could sell it .
i just really want to get better , you know ?
i , um , i don &apos;t think i can ...
it &apos;s just , we &apos;re family ,
you know ,
and family takes care of family .
so i woke up in the middle of a dream about you ,
and i &apos;m not gonna lie , it was kind of dirty ,
and anyway i was thinking things ,
and i went online to look at your sweet pics again ,
but when i got there , your account was private .
yeah , you know , i just ...
i suddenly realized that , like , anyone can see it , you know .
don &apos;t worry about it .
this doesn &apos;t have anything to do with that liam douche , does it ?
i could tell he kind of freaked you out at the party
and then i saw that comment he made
on the shot of the tree .
and i thought , &quot; is he flirting with her ?
is he threatening her ? &quot;
no . no , um , he was just kidding .
oh , he &apos;s hilarious , then .
no . he &apos;s just got like a weird sense of humor , i guess .
so who is he ? how do you know him ?
why ? you want to date him ?
yeah . yeah , he &apos;s totally my type .
so ...
he &apos;s just some guy i used to know . ok ?
hey . have you seen lexi ?
sorry , babe .
have you heard from her , anything ?
oh , better get to class before you get someone else pregnant .
i didn &apos;t ...
forget it .
and i think it &apos;ll be best if we work in pairs ,
that &apos;ll make it easier with two of you .
so , everybody needs to pick a partner .
do you have a ... ?
no .
do you want to be mine ?
ok , cool . how about i come over on saturday ?
my mom doesn &apos;t like it when kids come over .
she says it gives her migraines .
yeah , ok .
i mean , i have to ask , but ...
ok . well , let me know .
ok , everybody , back in your seats .
演唱者 sleeper agent
what are you doing here ? you &apos;re not mad at me ?
of course not .
oh my god , why would i be mad at you ?
my parents took away my computer and my phone
and i couldn &apos;t figure out a way to reach you ,
and i just thought ...
are you ok ?
it &apos;s awful . my mom cries every time she looks at me .
you &apos;re kidding ?
no . my dad hasn &apos;t talked to me since that night .
is this why you haven &apos;t been in school ?
was that the , um ... ?
what were the riveras doing here ?
they &apos;re pulling lexi out of school .
oh my god . they shouldn &apos;t ...
they are completely overreacting .
are they ?
because they &apos;re under the impression that you gave lexi
emergency contraception
without their consent or knowledge .
i tried to assure them that couldn &apos;t possibly be the case
seeing as it &apos;s school policy that we do not administer
so much as an aspirin without parental notice .
but they seemed pretty certain .
did they ... ?
are they planning on going to the board ?
not that they mentioned .
but if they &apos;re angry enough to pull lexi out of school ...
i hope you &apos;re happy .
what ?
you &apos;ve ruined her life &apos; cause you &apos;re so freakin &apos; pathetic and jealous .
what are you talking about ?
lexi .
they &apos;re sending her to a boarding school in texas .
all thanks to you .
way to take care of the people you love .
hey . i &apos;m headed home , but , uh ,
you know , i could take the long way .
i &apos;m waiting for wyatt , so ...
oh . cool .
all right , i &apos;ll see you at home then .
yeah , see you at home .
i thought i told you to shut the hell up !
i didn &apos;t ... what do you ... ?
your little boyfriend just sent me a threat online .
well , i wonder where he got that idea .
what &apos;d you tell him .
i didn &apos;t tell him anything .
leave me alone . ow ! liam , let me go .
i &apos;m not gonna warn you again .
stay away from me , and stay away from sarah ,
and tell your freak of a boyfriend to keep his mouth shut or else ...
hey , stop it !
wyatt , let him go !
liam , enough !
hey ! get ...
come on !
hey ! get the hell out of here !
stay away from callie ! if i ever see you again ...
shut up !
i told you to stay out of it ,
and now you &apos;ve just made things worse .
i was just trying to ...
go home , wyatt .
fine . you want me to stay out of it ,
i &apos;ll stay out of it for good .
so you want to tell me what was that all about ?
i mean , who was that guy ?
and why was he fighting with wyatt ?
that was liam .
the foster brother you told me about ?
how old is he , though ?
i mean , he looks like he was ... 30 .
he &apos;s 20 .
i guess he &apos;s 21 by now .
i figured he &apos;d be , you know , more our age .
and how long ago was this ?
i mean , when you guys were together ?
like a year or two .
so he was like 19 and you were ...
that &apos;s not cool , callie .
you know that , right ? that what he did wasn &apos;t cool .
i guess .
what &apos;s really not cool , though , is , uh ,
there &apos;s this girl , sarah .
she &apos;s younger than us ,
and she &apos;s living with his family ,
and , um , i &apos;m pretty sure ...
i &apos;m not sure you &apos;re listening to me here , stef .
my job could be in jeopardy .
ok , i hear you . but what i don &apos;t understand is why .
i gave lexi the pill , not you .
let &apos;s hope the parent board sees it that way .
they &apos;re going to the board ?
i wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
but you didn &apos;t do anything . i don &apos;t ...
yes , but you did .
and everything that you do comes back on me . we &apos;re partners .
i was trying to protect you ,
and i was trying to protect lexi .
she needed help .
she &apos;s been like a daughter to us , lena .
yes , but she &apos;s not our daughter ,
which is why we shouldn &apos;t have done it .
ok , i am sorry that things have gotten so messy .
i really am , but i don &apos;t think i did anything wrong .
lexi would have gone to her parents
if she felt safe enough to do so , and she didn &apos;t .
so it came down to us .
now you didn &apos;t want to do anything ...
i couldn &apos;t do anything .
i &apos;m sorry . you couldn &apos;t do anything , so i did .
i did the right thing .
hi , honey . what &apos;s up ?
hey . i can come back .
no , no , no . it &apos;s fine . it &apos;s fine . we &apos;re fine .
ok .
so , we have this assignment in school
where we have to build a model of dna or rna .
those are the things that make up genes .
yeah , i know .
so , we have to work in pairs ,
and i was wondering if my friend connor could come over tomorrow .
oh . is that it ?
yeah , sure . absolutely .
of course .
hey , do you want a snack ?
it &apos;s gonna be a little while till dinner .
i don &apos;t really like to eat between meals .
never met a kid who didn &apos;t like a snack .
i &apos;m glad he &apos;s making friends .
listen , i am happy to talk to the riveras .
no , absolutely not .
karina made it more than clear
that i am not to engage with them at all ,
and that means you , too .
this is ridiculous .
it might be ridiculous , but this is my career , stef .
it is my career .
you know what ? never mind . never mind .
we gotta start dinner .
mr. rivera ...
i &apos;ve got nothing to say to you .
then just listen to me .
you &apos;ve got a lot of nerve showing your face
after what you did .
i know . i &apos;m sorry . we made a mistake .
i wish i could take it back .
well , you can &apos;t .
come on . haven &apos;t you ever made a mistake before ?
yes , trusting you with my daughter .
you know it &apos;s a bad idea to go to bed angry , right ?
演唱者 sara jackson @-@ holman
yeah , well , i gotta sleep sometime ,
so guess i &apos;m out of luck .
good night .
uh , hi .
lena , the riveras are here !
come on in .
hello .
is , um ... is lexi here ?
no .
are you sure ?
yeah , the kids are all still sleeping .
why ?
because when we woke up this morning , she was gone .
she had packed a bag ... and she was gone .
so you haven &apos;t seen her ?
no . i just woke up .
are you sure ?
yeah , i swear .
ok .
maybe ... should i go and look for her ?
no , no , no . you stay put .
but if you think of anywhere she might be , you let us know .
he knows something .
i don &apos;t think so .
he &apos;s never been a very good liar .
what &apos;s going on ?
have you seen lexi ?
not since the other day . why ?
she ran away .
when ?
sometime last night . we &apos;re not exactly sure .
well , i &apos;m sure she hates me now ,
so i doubt i &apos;ll hear from her ,
but i &apos;ll let you know if i do .
it &apos;s not from her . i &apos;m sorry .
you know what ? we can track lexi &apos;s cell phone .
no .
we took it away .
ok . um ...
i think that we should file a police report . i really do .
let &apos;s look for her first .
she &apos;s probably at a friend &apos;s house ,
or maybe she went to the school .
ok . then how about , ernie , you and i go looking for her .
we &apos;ll check the school and the beaches ,
any of her usual hangouts .
sonia , you and lena can stay here
and make phone calls to her classmates .
i have contact numbers for the whole school .
that way if she does come here looking for jesus ,
one of you will be here to talk to her .
hey . how &apos;d you sleep ?
not great .
so , i was , uh , i was thinking , maybe you should call bill .
why am i gonna call my social worker ?
well , you know , to tell him about liam .
no . it won &apos;t do any good .
i mean , it &apos;ll be my word against his ,
and he &apos;ll just deny it .
but , i mean , it &apos;ll at least be like a red flag or something , right ?
here &apos;s the thing .
um , if i go in and tell bill what happened ,
it won &apos;t just be about liam , it &apos;ll be on my record , too .
if i admit to having any kind of relationship
with a foster brother , even a kiss ,
it goes in my file and i get put in the high @-@ risk category .
and if they decide that i am ...
... you know , sexually volatile ,
then they could put me in a group home .
and once you become one of those kids ,
you never get fostered again .
i mean , that &apos;s crazy , though .
it &apos;s the system .
so what about sarah ?
what ?
nothing . i was just ...
look , if you came in here to give me another lecture
about what a horrible person i am , don &apos;t bother .
i got the message . now , excuse me .
演唱者 kate earl
so she &apos;s not at the school .
we &apos;ll check the beaches where the kids hang out , all right ?
演唱者 julia &amp; the doogans
sounds good .
i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m checking .
she doesn &apos;t even have her phone .
well , you never know , she might borrow one , or ...
we &apos;re gonna find her , ernie .
we &apos;re gonna find her . i promise , ok ?
thanks .
she &apos;s just so stubborn .
most teenagers are .
it &apos;s their job , i think .
oh . not lexi , my wife .
she gets so angry and there &apos;s no talking to her .
she &apos;s not alone in that .
sending lexi away , really ?
so , you don &apos;t ...
of course she needs to be protected , but ...
so why are you ?
sonia wants to send lexi to live with her aunt ,
in honduras .
but i had to remind her why left in the first place .
there &apos;s so much violence .
sending lexi back there to keep her safe ...
well , that just doesn &apos;t make much sense .
a boarding school was a compromise we could both live with .
ok . ok , thank you .
thank you . good @-@ bye .
i know you &apos;re angry with us .
and i get it , i do .
but i just ... i wanted you to know
that we didn &apos;t condone lexi and jesus having sex .
and we taught our kids about safe sex
and about birth control , so i can &apos;t believe ...
and yet you say you didn &apos;t condone it ?
look , the reality is teenagers have sex .
dealing with that , it &apos;s ...
well , it &apos;s different than giving them a big thumbs @-@ up .
but why put those thoughts in their heads ,
why , when they &apos;re 15 ?
ok . regardless of our differences ,
we should have never given lexi that pill .
and ... i &apos;m sorry .
oh . hey ... come on in .
jude , connor &apos;s here !
so how &apos;s your saturday ?
pretty good . we won our soccer game .
very nice .
hey .
hey , jude .
the beatles !
it &apos;s a band that old people like .
ok , ouch .
why don &apos;t you guys head up to your room and get started .
jude has everything you should need .
come on .
hello ?
it &apos;s mariana .
i brought the stuff .
thanks .
your parents were at my house this morning ,
演唱者 julia &amp; the doogans
looking for you .
what did they say ?
not much .
they think jesus knows something , but not me .
you know , since we &apos;re not talking .
i don &apos;t have to stay here too long , right ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s up to you .
i guess as long as i miss my flight tomorrow ,
well , maybe that will give my parents time to calm down .
they seemed pretty scared .
this place is gross .
sorry . it was the only place i could think of
at the last minute .
no , i ...
it &apos;s great .
so what &apos;s been going on with you ?
well , i saw anna yesterday .
i thought you were done with that .
i just feel bad for her .
anyway , she asked me for money , again .
and then she said the most screwed up thing to me .
she said , &quot; we &apos;re family
and family takes care of family . &quot;
it &apos;s too bad they let tomlinson go .
they haven &apos;t been the same since .
they were so close to the super bowl .
who &apos;s your favorite player ?
oh . uh ... i like , you know ,
uh ... what &apos;s his name ?
actually , it &apos;s not mine .
it &apos;s jesus &apos; .
oh , that &apos;s cool .
do you board ?
that &apos;s jesus &apos; too .
pretty much everything in here is jesus &apos; .
where &apos;s all your stuff ?
i don &apos;t really have that much stuff .
when you move around all the time ,
things get lost or stolen .
so this is pretty much it .
everybody has too much stuff anyway .
i mean , like zack ?
all he talks about is i got this new thing this weekend .
it &apos;s stupid , right ?
he &apos;s such a jerk .
right ?
hey , you don &apos;t ever talk bad about anybody , like ever .
even those guys who called you names and stuff ,
you never say anything mean about them .
what &apos;s the point ?
i should probably get started .
oh my god ! hot !
and give it to me .
model face .
oh , my god , this is so vogue ,
you being all hot in this dump .
ooh ! that &apos;s a good one .
let me see !
oh my god , that &apos;s terrible .
you have to delete that .
actually , i should probably delete all of these .
just in case someone sees my phone or something .
so ...
what was it like ?
you know , having sex , i mean .
well , you know how everybody says
your first time isn &apos;t that great ?
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
i mean , it &apos;s sort of great and ...
... sort of awful and kind of weird , i guess .
i mean , jesus was super gentle ...
ok . mnh @-@ mnh . you can &apos;t say his name . you &apos;re grossing me out .
sorry . he was super gentle ,
and ... i don &apos;t know .
it did make me feel really close to him .
are you guys , you know , gonna do it again ?
i don &apos;t think so .
at least not now , anyway .
i should probably get home .
are you gonna be ok here by yourself ?
yeah .
thank you for ... all of this .
hey , we may not have the best accommodations ,
but you &apos;re always welcome at hotel mariana .
here goes nothing .
i told you to stay away from me .
look , i just need to talk to you , sarah ,
just for a minute .
leave me alone .
can i show you something ?
it was my dad &apos;s .
it doesn &apos;t open anymore ,
but i just like the fact that he carried it around .
yeah . hey , what happened to your dad ?
he &apos;s in jail .
well , he was in jail ,
but then he had to leave the country
and now he lives in , um , on an island .
oh , ok .
he made a lot of y and some people got mad ,
so he had to leave .
but he &apos;ll come back and get us .
and he &apos;s gonna take us to his really nice house ,
and it &apos;s right on the beach ,
and there &apos;s a pool and these really awesome cars .
and that &apos;s where all my stuff is at ,
at my dad &apos;s .
why are you lying ?
i &apos;m not .
you don &apos;t have to lie .
i just ...
sorry .
hey , you wanna play ridge racer ?
you go first .
whoa , this is so cool .
i know that this is not something you want to hear ,
but we need to file a police report
and we need to file it now .
time is everything and we need as many people out there
looking for her as possible .
is something going on ?
um , well , yes , i guess .
um , we didn &apos;t go to the police because , um ...
because we &apos;re undocumented .
wait , you &apos;re ...
illegal .
we are illegal immigrants .
what &apos;s up ?
the riveras are still here .
what ? why ?
they &apos;re about to file a police report .
why ? lexi just ran away , right ?
i don &apos;t know . i think .
i mean , she can &apos;t get in trouble
with the police for that , can she ?
if they find her , that could be the least of her problems .
lexi ?
wait . why did you bring him here ?
you gotta come back with us .
no way . i &apos;m not gonna go home
just so my parents can send me to some boarding school .
you have to .
because your parents are undocumented .
and there &apos;s something else .
you &apos;re undocumented too .
so i guess that &apos;s good , right ?
it sounds like they want to adopt me .
i think that &apos;s very good , alex .
and i &apos;m very happy for you .
so who would like to share next ?
callie ? would you like to ?
a little while ago ,
a year or two i was in a different foster home .
and ... i liked my foster brother .
i mean , really liked him .
it started out like no big deal .
he was nice and funny and ...
... and he paid a lot attention to me ,
which ... that doesn &apos;t happen a whole lot .
he even ...
he even used to hide candy bars in my bag ,
so that every day i &apos;d got to school
and open up my backpack and i &apos;d think of him .
and when we &apos;d watch tv he would sit beside me
and take my hand so that his parents wouldn &apos;t see .
or if we were alone in the house for a little while ,
he would tickle me or ...
he told me i was special .
i believed him .
you are special , callie .
i may be . yeah .
but not to him .
sarah ? where are you ... ?
i &apos;m sorry .
callie , stop !
sarah , wait !
liam told me you would do something like this .
he doesn &apos;t love you , sarah . he &apos;s just using you .
you don &apos;t know that .
yeah , i do .
&apos;cause i used to be you .
look , why don &apos;t you come with me , ok ?
and we can tell ..
if you tell anyone anything , i &apos;ll deny it .
everyone will think it &apos;s just you .
that you made it up .
or you &apos;re in love with him , or you &apos;re crazy .
it &apos;ll go on your record .
don &apos;t waste your time .
it &apos;s just gonna come back on you .
at least you tried .
you did everything you could .
now it &apos;s up to her .
it &apos;s her choice .
no , it isn &apos;t .
what ?
it isn &apos;t her choice .
at least it wasn &apos;t mine .
one night ... liam ...
... he came into my room
and he asked me to ... you know ?
and , um ...
and i told him i wasn &apos;t ready .
he ...
he forced me ...
um , he forced me to have sex with him .
i &apos;m sorry .
i always thought it was my fault .
you know ...
but it wasn &apos;t .
it wasn &apos;t my choice ,
and it wasn &apos;t my fault .
look , i know it &apos;s scary , but i promise you ,
the only thing the police are gonna be interested in
is finding your daughter .
they are not gonna ask questions about your status . ok ?
yeah , ok .
ok .
oh , my god , lexi .
where were you ?
where have you been ?
it doesn &apos;t matter where i was .
i only came back because
you &apos;re not sending me to boarding school .
i don &apos;t know what mari and jesus told you , but we are ...
they told me that i &apos;m undocumented .
and so are you .
and if you send me anywhere ,
i &apos;ll call immigration myself .
oh , hey , sweetie .
what do you , uh , what do you need ?
connor &apos;s mom is here to pick him up .
oh , ok . bye , connor . we will see you again soon .
i &apos;ll walk you ...
no , it &apos;s ok .
i got it .
ok . bye .
ok , i &apos;ll see you at school .
uh , wait .
here , keep it .
i can &apos;t .
