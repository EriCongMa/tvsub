okay , everybody , gather &apos; round .
who knew it was &quot; bring your girlfriend to work &quot; day ?
she is not my girlfriend .
judy is a cpr doll ,
and the hardest @-@ working girl in this diner .
oh , han , you shouldn &apos;t bring your sex doll out in public .
this is not my girlfriend or a sex doll !
earl , come over .
we &apos;re going to use judy to learn how to resuscitate .
i have a &quot; do not resuscitate &quot; clause ,
as in , i do not resuscitate others .
oleg .
what &apos;s up , han ?
oh , hey , judy .
how do you know judy ?
with a torso like that , she gets around .
okay , i will demonstrate .
oh , no !
judy &apos;s choking on something !
well , we know it &apos;s not you .
first you have to tilt the head back
and clear the airway and blow .
oh , max , i think we &apos;re witnessing his first kiss .
fourth , thank you very much .
han , why are you wasting your time kissing her ?
she doesn &apos;t have any arms .
just go for it .
what &apos;s up , everybody ? big day today .
not as big as christmas , but still marks the arrival
of someone very blessed : me .
yeah , we get it .
you talk about your birthday more than
kanye west talks about kanye west .
常把自己跟许多名人比拟 贝多芬 乔布斯 耶稣 等等
caroline , i thought you would be crying .
tears on your birthday have become as expected
as an ex @-@ disney star going to rehab .
麦莉 · 赛勒斯 小甜甜布兰妮 林赛 · 罗韩 都是这样
why would i be sad ?
i have my health , a business that &apos;s budding--
boobs that aren &apos;t .
i don &apos;t believe in birthdays .
you &apos;re only as old as you feel .
which makes me nothing years old .
speaking of nothing ...
caroline , are we still on for two boots pizza tonight ?
i &apos;m closing the diner early in honor of your birthday ,
and just not because the city has demanded to
look into the black mold situation .
absolutely , han .
you can have one slice with two toppings
or two slices with one topping ,
and my birthday cake is a free flan
&apos;cause i flirted with the dishwasher .
caroline , sweetheart , if i was you ,
i would just put my head through a plate glass window .
okay , everybody .
i have two announcements , both good news .
first , the guy who found the beak in his sandwich
is not suing ,
and second , i &apos;m gonna pop the question to sophie .
well , you &apos;ve already popped everything else .
what do you think ?
they say diamonds are a girl &apos;s best friend .
oh , really ?
i thought a girl &apos;s best friend
was someone just a little fatter than her .
it was my grandma &apos;s from russia .
i had my cousin svela swallow it to bring it to america .
she passed customs , then she passed this .
five , six rinses later , boom !
duty free .
well , i guess that &apos;s better than getting it at kay .
甚至有过顾客指出卖假钻之类的消息传出
is sophie expecting it ?
of course .
she doesn &apos;t like surprises
since her family barn was torched
by a mentally unstable farmhand .
hi , i have a delivery for caroline channing
from martin channing .
oh , it &apos;s a birthday gift from my daddy all the way from prison .
last year , he made me a macaroni art picture frame .
i mean , the man once rented miami
for a friend &apos;s bachelor party .
hey , that picture frame fed us for two days .
yeah , well , this thing is not pasta ,
and it &apos;s too big to fit through the door .
and so was i three months ago .
no , really .
my seat on an airplane used to be row three .
there it is in the street .
a condom full of hamburger meat ?
oh , my god .
is that a lamborghini ?
wait .
is that my lamborghini ?
yeah , it &apos;s a lamborghini aventador roadster .
prison arts and crafts has gotten pretty fancy .
well , it takes four years for these cars to be custom @-@ made .
this one was ordered in 2011 .
that &apos;s right , my father ordered this for me
when he still had money .
correction : when he had everyone else &apos;s money .
all my father ever gave me was that one iffy chromosome .
well , here you go .
it &apos;s all yours .
i &apos;m gonna walk home .
it &apos;s all about healthy choices .
i got a car !
we got a car !
damn , someone painted the batmobile white .
can &apos;t we have anything ?
that &apos;s a $ 450,000 sports car .
此车在中国售价约为750万人民币
i know .
add a stackable washer / dryer and a motor home ,
and it &apos;s like caroline won the showcase showdown .
it goes from 0 to 100 in 2.9 seconds .
and speaking of seconds ,
i &apos;m getting seconds at two boots ,
and that rich bitch is paying .
back off , tokyo drift .
this is our getaway car .
and by that , i mean get away from it .
you know , a car like this depreciates 50 %
the minute you drive it off the lot .
that &apos;s why i drive my toyota yaris .
is p. diddy here ?
wait a minute . is it ted turner ?
no one cool owns it .
it &apos;s caroline &apos;s .
now , this is the kind of car
that i would say yes to anything in .
anything except tickets to menopause the musical .
oh , hey , caroline . nice car .
i always liked you more than max .
you know that , right , girl ?
really ?
&apos;cause yesterday , i heard you yell to max ,
&quot; is caroline turning 47 or 48 ?
&apos;cause she acts like she &apos;s 65 . &quot;
yeah .
yeah , i wanted to know what to write in your birthday card .
well , everyone away from the car .
i just got off the phone with my dad .
the car is being seized in the morning .
turns out they won &apos;t let me keep my present .
it &apos;s just like my eighth birthday
when they made me return macaulay culkin .
they bought you a boy ?
you were rich .
oh , boy , the car &apos;s right here , and you can &apos;t even use it .
that &apos;s like me having you two for waitresses .
caroline , can i ask you a favor ?
you &apos;re not using the car to propose to sophie .
you heard how much she liked it .
and it &apos;s a little bit classier than my original plan :
dinner and a cock fight in yonkers .
not that i &apos;m listening ,
but i &apos;m not gonna get proposed to at a gay bar .
great , now my gay bar idea is out also .
no , oleg .
i can &apos;t return the car with scratches , dents ,
or chlamydia .
but we can still drive it , right ?
i mean , i &apos;ve been on that cream for like a month .
max , what is the ninth rule of the lamborghini club ?
no red drinks in the car .
here &apos;s my number one rule :
if you &apos;re going to make me sleep in it ,
i am going to drink in it .
well , just be careful .
i only have one clorox wipe
that has to last till my next birthday ,
and it &apos;s already lost a lot of its moisture .
i don &apos;t see why we have to just sit here .
we can &apos;t drive it .
my dad said if anything happens to it ,
we &apos;ll be responsible .
what could possibly happen
on a weed run to deep tijuana ?
you know , i wish this car never came ,
and i wish i never sat in it .
it &apos;s the same reason i don &apos;t go to barneys .
i don &apos;t like to be around things i can &apos;t afford anymore .
same reason i don &apos;t go to the 99 cent store .
there &apos;s a nerf tennis set
half on the floor , half in the bin ,
none of it going home with me .
i was trying to be positive about my birthday this year ,
but , max , if things hadn &apos;t happened with my father ,
tonight would have been a magical birthday for me .
hey , there was some magic .
i personally made five vodka sprites disappear .
ta @-@ da !
i would &apos;ve got in the car and driven out to the hamptons ,
and we &apos;d sit on the beach all night
having lobster caught by one of the townies
and drink champagne while taking duckface selfies
till the sun came up .
fyi , i &apos;m the townie in this scenario ,
and i hate all of you .
instead of doing any of that , i &apos;m having the worst birthday .
i probably feel worse than demi moore did
when she turned 50 .
yes , just go to sleep .
you &apos;ll feel better tomorrow when you wake up .
i mean , if that guy with the switchblade
doesn &apos;t come back like he promised he would .
caroline .
caroline , wake up .
we &apos;re at the beach .
i drove us out to the hamptons .
happy birthday !
we &apos;re in the hamptons ?
we &apos;re in the hamptons ?
how are we in the hamptons ?
how long have i been sleeping ?
three hours , give or take .
you farted twice .
how did i not wake up ?
i know . it was pretty bad .
after that last one , i thought we were going through egg town .
max , you did it again .
you roofied me , didn &apos;t you ?
of course i did .
you were crying and babbling about the hamptons ,
so i had to put you down .
you promised you wouldn &apos;t again .
the last time , i was out for two days .
yeah , i really just needed to get through game of thrones
without someone talking during the incest .
what is wrong with you ?
have you got a pen and paper ?
you knew i didn &apos;t want to do this .
you never want to do anything , so i did it for you .
you took a $ 450,000 car ,
a car we &apos;re not even supposed to be touching ,
on a joyride to the hamptons ?
you wanted to be here .
you are here .
just enjoy it .
i can &apos;t enjoy it .
scotty to the bridge .
this is captain kirk .
scotty to the bridge .
you drove over the dunes and onto the beach ?
not intentionally .
i tried to stop it , but this car was like ,
&quot; mm , no , girl . &quot;
oh , my god .
did it get any scratches ?
max , get out of the car , and help me look for scratches .
you said you were more fun in the hamptons .
not true .
mr. sulu , fire all phasers .
no scratches . the lamborghini is fine .
but thanks to you , i &apos;m a rent @-@ a @-@ wreck .
come on , we have to get this car back .
we will . jeez , relax .
we still have time .
look , you said you wanted to be here .
you &apos;re here , and we are not leaving
till you do something beach @-@ y ,
like walk in the water
or find a half @-@ eaten lady from jaws .
no . no way . let &apos;s go .
just take off your shoes or something .
no .
just take off your shoes and feel the sand .
max ! max , stop .
i haven &apos;t had a proper pedicure
since justin timberlake released a single .
there . now move your foot around .
no .
no . no ! no .
oh , yeah . that feels nice .
the cold sand between my toes .
but , max , don &apos;t look .
that middle nail &apos;s a horror show .
too late .
i thought it was a pistachio for a second .
max , how much do you love the beach ?
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;ve never been to one .
you &apos;ve never been to a beach ?
no . what &apos;s the point ?
i don &apos;t own a metal detector .
well , time &apos;s up .
but we just sat down .
i know , but if we leave right now ,
we &apos;ll still have enough time to
blow through a mcdonald &apos;s drive @-@ through
like something from back to the future .
well , i &apos;m gonna write our names in the sand
&apos;cause it was a really nice thing
for you to drug me , kidnap me ,
and steal my car to get me out here .
hey , we &apos;re friends .
all right , i &apos;ll just turn this baby around .
uh @-@ oh .
what &apos;s &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; ?
what is &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; ?
are we stuck in the sand ?
you have correctly identified the meaning of &quot; uh @-@ oh . &quot;
i love that we don &apos;t need full sentences
to communicate anymore .
try it again .
nope .
i &apos;ve had less trouble getting out of athlete &apos;s apartments .
well , you &apos;re gonna have to get out and push .
why do i have to push ?
because you &apos;re the one who drugged me , kidnapped me ,
and stole my car .
exactly .
i &apos;ve already done the lion &apos;s share of the work .
and it &apos;s our car .
fine , i &apos;ll do it .
door &apos;s up , lieutenant uhura .
it stopped being funny when we got stuck .
god , don &apos;t worry .
i got a 600 @-@ pound woman out of a booth
at the diner with my bare hands . i &apos;m fearless .
toss her in neutral like i did with that lady .
sand and heels . not a good combo .
not a good combo . not a good combo .
oh , all right .
all right .
i &apos;m gonna floor it .
on the count of three .
one , two ...
i got excited . i went early .
if i had a dime for every time i heard that ,
i could buy this car .
all right , let &apos;s try again .
one , two ...
okay , that was on purpose .
a little bit .
i can &apos;t believe it .
i can &apos;t believe that i can &apos;t believe it ,
but i really can &apos;t believe it .
we are in very big trouble ,
and we &apos;re not even in the good hamptons .
i was trying to do something nice .
first time , last time .
you know what you are ?
you are reckless .
you know , all this time ,
i thought you were a ride @-@ or @-@ die kind of bitch .
i am a ride @-@ or @-@ die kind of bitch .
what &apos;s a ride @-@ or @-@ die kind of bitch ?
are you googling &quot; ride @-@ or @-@ die kind of bitch &quot; ?
i would be , but i only have two bars .
look , we have two options :
get the car out of the sand , or let the tide take us .
put a pin in that tide thing ,
&apos;cause i like the sound of it .
we barely have enough time to get this car back to the city ,
or we owe $ 450,000 .
and i only have $ 3 , and 2 of it &apos;s in nickels .
now get in the car .
you &apos;re hoarding nickels ,
and i &apos;m walking out of the 99 cent store empty @-@ handed ?
now i &apos;m mad .
get ready .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m pushing us out of here .
because i &apos;m a ride @-@ or @-@ die kind of bitch !
i think .
now hit it !
what &apos;d you do ? fart us out of the ditch ?
seriously , caroline , step on it .
no , max .
we can &apos;t risk getting into an accident .
what if it &apos;s not fatal ?
driving a lamborghini slow is like going to red lobster
and not getting the cheddar bay biscuits .
come on , we got to enjoy this car while we can .
hit the gas .
all right .
i &apos;ll take it up to the top of my age dating window .
40 .
and i &apos;ll take it to the top of mine .
80 !
let go . have some fun .
no , don &apos;t push on my leg !
don &apos;t push on my--
yes ! yes !
best birthday ever !
should we thelma and louise it ?
you mean drive over a cliff ?
no , i mean wear sunglasses and hold hands .
they drive over a cliff ?
i never saw the end .
there they are .
did you girls get the car back in time this morning ?
yep , just in time , thanks to caroline .
she was ignoring speed limit signs
like she does homeless people .
a state trooper called my driving
criminally negligent .
i was so proud .
i might &apos;ve even gotten emotional ,
but i had to talk our way out of the ticket ,
and i like to be professional when my shirt &apos;s off .
you didn &apos;t get a ticket ?
yesterday , i got arrested for just walking into whole foods .
i can &apos;t believe i still have sand in my hair .
if the only place you still have sand is in your hair ,
you &apos;re lucky .
i &apos;m about to make a pearl down there .
oh , hey , there , destitute barbie .
sorry you lost the dream car .
anyway , i &apos;ll be in my booth .
sophie , beautiful baby ...
i &apos;ve narrowed down the site of my proposal to three options :
a , the place we met ...
b , the place we &apos;ve had sex most often ...
or c , the place we &apos;ve had sex most recently .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
all three of those places are this booth !
that &apos;s right .
sophie kachinsky ...
he &apos;s proposing at the diner ?
what &apos;s he gonna do ? put an onion ring on it ?
i love that .
you know , i was planning on saying no
and making you beg for a few hours , but ...
i just love you too much .
aw , that &apos;s so not as gross as normal .
now it is .
