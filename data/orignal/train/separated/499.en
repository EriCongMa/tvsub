Fate
Hey. Check it out.
Jessica, chill. You're always like this.
It's happened before. Just calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down!
A $5.00 tip on a $100 service is rude.
I am sick of these people stiffing me.
Yesterday some guy gave me a $6.00 tip.
The day before that, $2.00.
She's lucky I didn't sock her in the face.
Oh, Jessica...
Hey, uh, let me call you back.
We're--we're closed.
Hello?
H-hello?
There you go.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Let me call you back.
I thought you might need this.
Yesterday when I saw that you were following me,
I thought it had to be a coincidence,
but by today, mm, probably not.
It's a long story.
Well, I'm a writer. I hate the short ones.
So what are you, a P.I.?
Yeah, you can call me that, sure.
Who do you work for?
I can't say. My client's very secretive.
Well, you can't be with the IRS.
My accountant would have called.
Look--
Can't be with the State Department.
A spy would know better
than to leave her target's dossier on the front seat.
Yeah, right.
And I know you don't work for my cigar guy
because he makes all of his deliveries straight to my door.
So, why don't you tell whoever it is
that if they want to discuss something,
they should get out of their sandbox and call me themselves.
Got it.
Now, most people would ask for the coffee back.
But, being a gentleman,
c'est la vie.
Oh, and, uh, get yourself and earpiece.
Those things will give you brain cancer.
3 bodies have been found in Reston, Virginia,
each violently stabbed, then posed,
about a week apart.
The first two, Kevin Brown and Rick Mendoza,
were murdered in their homes. The third one, Jessica Randall,
was killed in her hair salon last night.
Bold and brutal. So what did the first two victims do?
Kevin worked at a hardware store. Rick was an auto mechanic.
Maybe the unsub's a customer.
We should check appointment logs.
Already did that.
Well, gender isn't a factor.
They could all be victims of opportunity.
Did they live near each other?
3 miles apart.
They still could have been strangers.
Both homes were broken into through a back window.
Washington field isn't sure the unsub got into the salon.
It's high risk. Maybe we're looking at a drug addict?
But nothing was stolen.
And he took the time to re-dress the victims.
Strange. The unsub stabbed the victims in their original clothing
and then found clean ones to put them in.
Yeah, they fit well. Maybe he brought the new ones with him.
Or he could have taken them from their homes.
So the unsub took the clothes the
victims were wearing as trophies.
They weren't found on the scene. It could be a ritual.
Or our unsub gets high on the kill,
then comes down, feels remorse.
The time between kills is decreasing,
suggesting the unsub's emboldened
and getting better at victim acquisition.
Then the after effects of the killing
would either exacerbate his guilt
or cause him to strike out again soon.
Is mom coming down?
I think she went for a run.
Again?
Since when did she become an athlete?
I don't know.
You don't think this is odd?
I don't ask questions.
Well, maybe that's the problem.
Sky, don't start with me.
First she snaps at us, now she's running at 6 A.M.?
Something's going on.
I think she's fine.
Yeah, she's just trying to get it together.
She's acting weird.
Everyone's noticing.
Who's everyone? Did you take a poll?
Grandma, aunt Shirley,
even Kathy said something.
Well, Kathy gossips about everything.
So, look, just cut your mom some slack, ok?
She's been through a lot.
Besides, her physical therapist recommended exercise.
Twice a day?
Sky.
I'm home!
Ellen. I made French toast.
Oh, French toast? Sounds good. I'll be right down.
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok.
It's ok.
It's ok.
You're ok.
"Change is the law of life.
"and those who look only to the past or present
are certain to miss the future."
John F. Kennedy.
All right, victimology. From what we can tell,
the victims' lives didn't intersect.
Since one worked at a hardware store
and the others at a body shop and a hair salon,
maybe he's targeting local businesses.
Or our unsub's the common thread.
I cross-checked patrons. There's no overlap.
He might have paid cash.
We should check security footage.
There's no obvious vulnerability or desirability
component to the unsub's selection criteria.
But the brutality was the same.
Over a dozen stab wounds in each victim.
This feels personal.
There's definitely overkill and rage.
Well, there wouldn't have been time between the kills
for planning or surveillance.
Maybe our unsub knew the victims
and this is a vendetta?
If that's the case, we need to find
the nexus between these victims.
There'll be a Washington field agent to meet you when you arrive.
I'm picturing tempered inlaid glass on every floor,
which will create a greenhouse effect.
It will allow for constant moderate climates
throughout the building.
Exactly. Saving millions in energy costs.
So we'll be green.
And you'll save green.
We'll even thrown in heat-sensing floors
which are regulated by body temperature.
Oh, I love it. You did amazing work.
Thank you.
I can't take all the credit.
It's that Cornell Education kicking in.
We'll send final jpegs Friday, and if you approve,
we can be breaking ground by the end of the month.
Let's do this.
Thank you so much.
You did a good job.
Thank you.
What was that?
A slam dunk.
You took my idea!
What are you talking about?
That was the team's idea.
Which I spent months developing.
The least you could have done was give me credit.
Are you serious?
You do this every time.
You act like you're having an epiphany
and everyone knows you're in your office
making dinner plans.
Ellen, my job is to manage.
Sometimes I remember who says what
and sometimes I don't.
What I do remember, however,
is covering for you for 6 months
when you were out from your accident.
That has nothing to do with this.
Sure it does. I wrote your reports, I finished your designs.
Don't switch this around.
Oh, I won't. I'll just make sure to tell Bob and Sam
everything I did for you when you were out on disability,
Extended 3 weeks past what the government allows.
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm going to go celebrate our team's win,
and I would love for you to join us,
if you can break away from your little pity party.
Penelope, I need you to get some intel.
Oh. Like Nancy Drew style or Jason Bourne?
Or I can do a "ray" show.
I could do like 27% Nancy, 53% Jason, or--
Well, whatever you think is appropriate. I'm being followed.
What, like a stalker?
No, P.I. I just gotta find out who she's working for.
Maybe somebody I put away, or...
she could be a crazy fan.
OMG, you have a groupie.
You're officially a rock star.
Yeah, right. I'll send you her license plate.
And I will start spelunking.
Goodbye.
P.I.? Maybe you've got an admirer.
She had a file on me this thick.
You'd be surprised how much you can print out from google.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Yeah, well, I hope you're right.
This is why I don't get remarried.
I struck out 3 times.
I'm better off just doing my job,
writing my books, and living alone.
Hey. SSA Norwood.
SSA Rossi.
Callahan.
It's kind of a strange scene.
There's no real evidence of a break-in.
Looks like our unsub's highly skilled.
Still frenzied.
Body was found here?
Sitting up.
But it was dragged from over there.
If the unsub were a fit guy,
he'd probably be able to lift her completely off the floor.
This person couldn't, which suggests
he may be weak or injured or possibly a woman.
So the unsub again put her in something new.
There are no perforations.
So where's the vic's original clothes?
Seems like a lot of effort to expend for trophies.
Bingo.
So the unsub cleaned them.
Probably washed the other victims' stuff as well.
We'll check their homes.
Washing could be a forensic countermeasure.
A male offender would have destroyed the clothes.
Our unsub's a woman.
Let's get CSI to sweep all the other lint filters
for trace evidence of the killer.
So Jessica called you from the salon last night?
Yeah. I can't believe this.
And how was your conversation?
Did anything seem out of the ordinary?
No. We were in the middle of a little argument,
but Jessica and I always argued.
What was yesterday's about?
Jessica went off on a client
and wanted me to say she was justified.
Was she afraid that the client would retaliate?
No. Customers stiffed her all the time.
Jessica had a tendency to go scorched earth
when she should have just stayed quiet.
And how did she end the conversation?
It was quick.
But that was normal, too.
It's just usually she'd call me back
and...she didn't.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Victim number two, Rick Mendoza,
had a direct personality.
He would tell it like it is at the body shop.
And Jessica had the same sort of reputation at the salon.
Since all of our victims are in the service industry,
maybe our unsub interfaced with them and had bad interactions.
Someone might have seen something.
We'll keep interviewing co-workers
and surrounding business owners.
I'll have Garcia look at Jessica's clients.
Maybe somebody retaliated.
The wounds are all over the place.
Rage might be an understatement.
This offender had patience.
She's been scrubbed perfectly clean.
Rossi and Kate think we might be looking for a female killer.
The unsub washed the victims' clothes as well.
You know, this might all fall under
the umbrella of "one neat aspect."
I've heard of that. In the midst of a chaotic crime scene,
one thing gets special attention
and is cleaned or organized.
Yeah, in this case, it could mean anything related
to cleaning the victim,
including washing their bodies or their clothes.
It's possible our unsub was recently released from an institution
where she learned regimented behavior.
Yeah. We should check long-term mental facilities and prisons,
even recently discharged military personnel.
What's this?
I pulled if off the vic's smock.
It doesn't match her DNA.
So it either belongs to a client from earlier
or it could possibly be our unsub's.
Thank you very much for your time.
Let's get back to the BAU.
Hey, Rossi.
We just got back. You got something?
Not about the case, but I found something mysterious.
I ran that license of the car
of the woman that's following you.
It turns out it's a rental,
and she is far from a P.I.
She's actually a TV crime reporter in San Francisco.
Her name is Joy Struthers.
Wait. Crime reporter?
Yeah. And she writes her own blog,
and last year she self-published a novel
about the Zodiac Killer.
Stop. I've heard enough.
I think she's a fan girl.
Is that another name for crazy person?
It's a psycho fan who thinks I'm comic-con.
Rossi, I think she just wants a blurb
for her next book.
Which she needs, because the last one only sold 385 copies.
387. I bought two 'cause I felt bad.
You can't diss a girl for trying.
Oh, yes, I can.
Thank you, Penelope.
So, you got a sycophant who wants a mentor.
Do you believe this?
Look on the bright side. It's not one of your exes
looking for more money.
No, it's a weirdo looking for tutelage.
I tried that once.
The woman left her manuscript all over my house.
Wait. She broke in?
6 times.
Well, where is she now?
She's doing 5 to 10.
Ooh. Classy.
Anything?
Lots of long brown hairs in the dryer.
They don't match the victim.
We found hair, too.
Maybe the unsub's losing it.
Or our victims yanked it out
while fighting for their lives.
Clearly, she not forensically sophisticated.
We should run it for DNA.
We might get an I.D.
or at least ethnicity and an age range.
Because of the one neat aspect,
we had Garcia check out people in regimented institutions,
but she came up empty.
Did she check out D.C., Maryland, and Virginia?
The whole DMV.
Washington Field found the clothes
our first two victims, were stabbed in
neatly folded up in their respective closets.
Well, at least our unsub's considerate.
We should keep searching.
Clearly her desire to kill is unabated.
You don't have to do this.
Don't have to do this.
Yes, you do. You hate her. You hate her.
Hello.
Ellen.
Yeah.
Where are you?
I need to see my boss.
Now? It's kind of late.
I know, but it's really important,
and, um, she needs to go over some stuff with me.
This couldn't wait till morning?
No, we gotta do it right now.
I thought the presentation was over.
Yeah, it is. We have another one,
and she--she really needs my ideas.
Where are you meeting her?
A bar--a bar.
What bar?
Michael, I'll see you when I get home.
You should have seen her.
She thought I took her idea.
Isn't she the one that does nothing?
Nothing. I do everything.
I spend half of my time
reworking her generic crap.
You should cut her loose.
I talked to Bob and Sam about it. They said start documenting.
Good.
She's just a jealous bitch.
You know what you need?
You need to relax.
How about some wine?
And then maybe a back rub?
Cool.
But first...
get into something more comfortable.
Greg, I'm ready.
Greg?
I get it.
Be more spontaneous, Sarah.
We'll do it in the kitchen, then.
Greg!
Oh, my God!
Please...please...
No!
Please!
Please don't!
No, Ellen!
Did you take my idea?
Yes, I did. I'm so sorry.
I want to hear that louder.
Yes, yes! I stole your idea and I'm sorry!
I'm sorry I took your ideas.
No, no! no, Ellen!
Ellen!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
911. What's your emergency?
Hello?
911, what's your emergency?
Good morning, honey.
How did it go with your boss?
Great.
She really loved my stuff.
That's good, honey.
We checked the house. No sign of a break-in.
The housekeeper discovered the bodies around 8 a.m.
Local P.D. also has a record
of a hang-up 911 phone call last night.
But they were so swamped
they didn't send out a patrol car.
Did you find the victim's old clothes?
In the dryer.
Her body was also scrubbed clean,
whereas the boyfriend's was left bloody in the kitchen.
So Sarah's the intended victim,
which means the kills are targeted.
It sounds like the unsub
had a specific interaction with each victim.
Is that more hair?
Thank you.
Hmm. This time they were pulled from the root.
It was over here,
so it probably didn't happen during the struggle.
What if the unsub's pulling her own hair out.
Why would she do that?
Because she has to.
We should deliver the profile.
We believe the unsub we'relooking for is a caucasian women
between the ages of 40 and 50.
We think that she's suffering from what we call
intermittent explosive disorder.
This disorder usually occurs after a traumatic event.
It involves repeated acts of impulsive
and aggressively violent behavior.
It involves angry outbursts where the sufferer reacts
in disproportion to the situation.
In this case, the unsub lets her anger fester,
then later lashes out. We believe she had
prior confrontations with all the victims.
After she kills or is thinking about killing,
we believe that she's pulling her out hair out.
This is called tricotillomania,
and it's a way that she relieves stress.
She'll appear rational at times
but be triggered by external disputes or confrontations.
Her anger and remorse will make her feel like
she has two personalities.
And we believe she was hospitalized because of mental problems
but she stops taking her medication since being released.
And since she's no longer in the environment
that helped her control her urges,
she's been triggered to start killing.
We see no indication
that these homicidal feelings in her will subside.
We believe she will continue to kill
as long as she encounters stressors that set her off.
Michael, what are you doing here?
I needed to talk to you.
Well, it's gotta wait. Honey, I gotta go pick up Max
from basketball practice.
No, Kathy's gonna take care of that.
Kathy? Why Kathy?
Because you're not doing well, Ellen.
I'm fine.
You're far from fine.
Ever since the accident, you've been acting strange.
Staying out late, leaving early.
Michael, I have a ton of work to do.
Add that to what I found upstairs,
I don't know what to say.
What you found?
Michael, you went through my things?
This is your shirt.
It was in the back of your closet.
What did you do, Ellen?
Oh, honey.
On the news they're talking about a woman
who's hurting people and pulling out her hair?
Did you hurt those people?
Of course not.
You weren't home last night. Now your boss is dead.
Did you hurt her?
No.
So that's a coincidence?
What did you do?
Where did you get that bruise?
I can't help you unless you're honest with me.
Oh, God.
Oh, Michael.
I killed them.
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just did it.
I tried to stop and I can't.
I know. I know.
Listen, we're gonna get you help.
I'm gonna be by your side.
Oh, Michael.
I'm right here, ok?
Oh, Michael, I don't know what's happening to me.
You're sick.
We're gonna get through this.
I'm sorry.
I know.
We have to tell the police.
Oh, no, Michael, no, I can't. No.
They need to know the truth.
Michael, no. Are you listening to me? No!
Are you listening, Michael?!
Oh, my God! Ellen.
Help me.
Ok, come on.
Get out, out, out.
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened?!
Dad?
I can explain.
Dad!
Come on, let's go. Let's go!
Ok, I know that we said we weren't looking for an addict.
What about somebody who was in rehab,
is now off drugs and out?
Theory?
Same structured behavior. Similar routines
Similar routines to being institutionalized.
No, there's no one who fits the profile
in any drug rehab center.
Can you check surrounding areas?
I checked every state.
What else could have caused her I.E.D?
Frontal lobe damage from a head injury of some sort.
Then maybe she had to undergo inpatient physical therapy.
A rehabilitation program
would have exposed her to regimented behavior.
And the moment that she was released
or started driving her car,
her rage could have been triggered.
And check physical rehab centers as well.
On it.
You're kidding.
What?
Nothing. I'll be right back.
What the hell are you doing here?
I can explain.
You come to my job?
I need to talk to you.
You're crazy. You're not a P.I.
You're a reporter trying to be a novelist.
How the hell did you even get in here?
I got a press pass.
Press pass?
I had to see you.
Look, if I catch you at my work again,
you'll be writing an opus from behind bars.
Security!
No, please don't do this.
Escort her out of here.
Please.
Out.
I'm your daughter!
I have checked all local rehab facilities
for recently released patients that fit the profile.
I'm still coming up empty.
And what about private or
HMO-run physical rehab centers?
Wait...
Uh, uh, ok, 10 months ago
a woman named Ellen Connell
was in a horrible car accident
that put her in an HMO rehab center for 4 months.
What happened?
Her car collided with two teen girls.
How bad was Ellen hurt?
So bad that she had hundreds of days of physical therapy
due to head injuries. She was released a month ago,
a week before the first killing.
She must have had frontal lobe damage
that destroyed her impulse control.
And since she's developed I.E.D,
she's no longer able able to control
her bursts of rage and the violence that follows.
So she's fine until she gets mad.
But after she kills and her anger subsides,
she reverts back to her normal behavior.
Is there any overlap of the victims?
She works at the same
architectural firm as her latest victim.
And she specializes in doors and windows.
That's how she was able to
get in and out of the crime scenes.
She also ordered a bunch of wigs
and lives two blocks away
from the third victim's hair salon.
All right, send the address to our phones.
My mom is Hayden Montgomery.
You married her in '84 in Paris.
I know who Hayden is.
She was a diplomat,
you were on temporary duty with the FBI.
Hayden would have told me if she was pregnant.
Ok, my dad --
my stepdad told me about you
when he was dying of cancer,
and it forced my mom to finally come clean.
How can I believe you?
First you tell me you're a P.I. and now this?
Ok, I was scared.
Look, you can even call my mom.
She's still in Paris.
Hey, Rossi. We gotta go.
We'll straighten this out later.
Leave your info at the front desk.
So why was she here? What did she want?
Nothing.
You ok?
Yeah. I'm fine.
Mom, where are we going?
Shut up.
Why are you doing this?
Just drive.
We need to go to 482 Crow's Nest Lane.
Who lives there?
It doesn't matter. Just move.
Got a victim down here.
Dave?
Anything?
Abby Benson. One of the girls
Ellen was in the accident with.
Willing and able.
Garcia, we're outside of Ellen Connell's office.
Check her IP address and see if she was trying to reach
an Abby Benson recently.
Looks like she followed her on twitter
the moment she got out of rehab.
She checks her Instagram daily.
How about today?
Pop goes the weasel.
She googled Abby's address
from her phone 10 minutes ago.
It's her endgame.
Thanks, Garcia.
Get out.
Get out!
Mom, what are we doing here?
If we hurry, we can do this.
Whose house is this?
Would you stop talking!
Hi, may I help you?
Yes. I'm Ellen Connell,
the one your daughter hit with her car.
Excuse me?
Oh, my God!
Mommy, please!
What's going on?
Who are you?!
The woman whose life you destroyed.
Just admit you were wrong.
The accident was your fault!
I'm the one in the wheelchair. You hit me!
I didn't hit you!
Yes, you did. You hit her and you killed her friend.
Mom, she's telling the truth.
No. Had she been paying attention,
none of this would have happened.
I had the right of way.
The ground was wet.
Mom, please -- - Shut up!
Whose side are you on?
You ruined my life.
Washed it into the gutter.
I've lost everything because of you!
Put the knife down!
Get out.
Put it down, Ellen.
You don't want to kill her.
You don't want to kill any of them.
Your brain is tricking you, Ellen.
You have frontal lobe damage from the accident.
Your reasoning is off.
No. I'm fine.
You're not fine, and you know it.
It's why you're pulling your hair out, Ellen.
Please just go!
Ellen, she's your daughter. Look at her.
Now, it's not too late to fix this.
She and Max are all that's left.
Don't hurt them, too.
This isn't me.
We know that, Ellen.
Just put the knife down.
Mom...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm Jennifer.
I am going to pick up your brother
and take the both of you to your aunt's house.
This is my fault.
No. No, don't say that.
I knew there was something wrong.
I should have done more.
No one ever sees this coming.
We're gonna get your mom help.
She's gonna need your support.
Ok?
Do you think the jury will be sympathetic?
Maybe. There is proof
that the accident altered her brain.
Excuse me.
What do you mean, she checked out?
Yeah. That's what her credit card said. She left an hour ago.
Do you know where she went?
Well, check the airports, train stations.
Ok. Ok. Uh...
she bought a plane ticket that leaves at 9:54 tonight.
Dulles or National?
Great. Thanks.
What's going on?
I need a car.
Ok. Is everything all right?
It's not that I don't want to be married.
I just don't want to stay here.
My job is here, David.
And I'm not asking you to leave it.
All right. You're all set.
Thanks.
Hey, it's me.
How are you?
I'm good.
Are you sure?
You don't sound all that good.
Hey, I'm fine.
Joy?
What -- what are you doing here?
You flew all the way out here to meet me.
I figured you had a few questions.
I know I do.
And if your first question is,
will you please just leave me alone,
I respect that.
Why didn't you stay with her?
Your mom and I had a complicated relationship.
It was a whirlwind summer in Paris,
and when it was over,
the reality was I was moving up in the FBI
and she was a diplomat.
That's not good enough.
Look, I wanted to take over the world,
and she was already doing it.
She was meeting with dignitaries,
traveling to different countries.
And I couldn't handle it.
And instead of manning up,
I pushed her away.
I told her I wasn't sure I wanted to be married.
But honestly, I j -- I just wanted to catch up.
You were the love of her life.
I didn't believe that.
I know what I said to you earlier,
that if your mom was pregnant,
she would have told me.
But the truth is, she wouldn't have said anything.
I was in no position to have a family,
and she knew it.
I was running away.
Had you known, would you have stayed?
I can't speak for the David Rossi of 30 years ago.
I'd like to think I would have.
But -- but I'm standing here right now.
Look, can you just stay a little while longer?
I'll pay for the change of ticket.
Oh, no, actually, I've got to go.
Um...you have a grandkid who's running a fever.
Grandkid?
Yeah. A 2-year-old boy, Kai.
You're killing me.
And you'd love my husband.
He's Italian.
Look...
if you don't mind having some company this weekend...
I'd love to meet them and...
get to know you.
Ma'am, we're about to close the door.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like that.
Dad.
