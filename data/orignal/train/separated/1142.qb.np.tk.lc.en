do you realize what these videos are ?
ian &apos;s been watching us for years .
there &apos;s nothing wrong about us , toby .
we &apos;re not really related .
alison &apos;s so cunning .
if this video gets out , we will lose everything .
i won &apos;t let that happen .
hi , i &apos;m jackie molina .
is this the montgomery house ?
excuse me
she was the first really serious girlfriend i ever had .
not telling me about her was a lie .
i &apos;m sorry .
you were spying on me the whole time .
not the whole time .
don &apos;t touch me .
make sure she gets this .
they extended your dad &apos;s assignment .
he wants us to come to texas .
you mean for a visit ?
for a year .
look , i &apos;ve never had a safe place to land ,
but now i feel like i do .
melissa would want me to take care of this .
gonna take care of me like you took care of alison ?
well , is that why you killed her ,
&apos;cause she found your home movies ?
please . if you love my sister , you won &apos;t do this .
i &apos;m doing it because i love her .
let go of me ! what are you doing here ?
is this some kind of a joke ?
there &apos;s nobody in there .
&quot; sleep tight ... &quot;
&quot; while you still can , bitches .
&apos;a &apos; . &quot;
he wasn &apos;t moving , okay , and he was not breathing .
because he was dead .
is dead .
not was , is .
so , unless we &apos;re saying ian &apos;s a zombie ,
someone moved the body .
it was probably stuffed in the trunk of &quot; a &apos;s &quot; car .
it &apos;s probably on its way to a meat grinder .
oh , em , come on , you gotta quit watching those horror films .
you guys , &quot; a &apos;s &quot; probably watching us right now .
any one of these people could be &quot; a. &quot;
half the town is here !
they want to see you girls down at the station .
i &apos;m here to drive you .
uh , well , i saw my parents earlier .
they &apos;re going to want to know where we &apos;re going .
they &apos;ll meet us there . come on .
let &apos;s go .
hey , i thought we were going to the police station .
why are we stoping ?
garrett ...
let &apos;s go .
no , i &apos;m not going anywhere .
get out of the car .
it &apos;s not safe to talk in the car .
it doesn &apos;t really feel safe out here , either .
look , i &apos;m sorry if i scared you ,
but there &apos;s some things you guys need to know
before you start answering questions .
then let &apos;s know .
all right , the police cannot know
that you were blackmailing ian , and that i was helping you .
it &apos;s a serious crime .
well , what about the messenger ?
he doesn &apos;t want any trouble .
and the money ?
for now , i &apos;m hiding it .
what about the videos ?
you still have them ?
yeah , we made a copy .
okay , look , i &apos;ve never asked you guys how you got them ,
and i don &apos;t want to know .
but you &apos;d better be prepared to tell the police how you did ,
because that &apos;s the first question they &apos;re gonna ask you .
officer reynolds , what &apos;s your eta ?
uh , yeah , we &apos;re en route .
roger that .
i hate asking you to lie like this ,
but are we all clear ?
we &apos;ll keep the videos a secret .
for now .
okay , good . let &apos;s get back .
i &apos;m sorry we got you into this .
well , we &apos;ll be okay .
we just need to stick to our story , yeah ?
my brain is numb from all those cop questions .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;d be here if it wasn &apos;t for &quot; a. &quot;
&quot; a &quot; killed ian to keep you here .
i &apos;m sorry , but that is not a comforting thought .
&quot; a &quot; gives so she can take . we know that .
so what &apos;s the bitch gonna ask for ?
whatever it is , i don &apos;t think we can afford it .
spence , you didn &apos;t ...
you didn &apos;t see anything ?
i saw a black hoodie ,
black boots , and gloves .
well , i think it &apos;s safe to say that &quot; a &quot; &apos; s not jenna .
are we sure ?
&quot; a &quot; sees everything , hanna .
i &apos;m starting to think we should tell someone about her-- him-- it .
what &apos;s the worst thing that can happen ?
&quot; a &quot; knows all of our secrets .
if people find out , we &apos;ll always be
&quot; those girls who blinded jenna marshall . &quot;
and now we &apos;re &quot; those girls who are afraid of &apos; a. &apos; &quot;
no , em , i mean , you &apos;re right , but ...
look , we have so much to lose .
i feel like i have a hangover ,
and i never went to the party .
we need caffeine .
oh ! no offense , but can i make it ?
seriously ?
i &apos;m with aria .
yeah . sorry , spence ,
but your coffee gives me the shakes .
amateurs .
what &apos;s going on ?
mom ?
veronica , since this is your idea ...
the accusations you made about ian
have cast a bright spotlight on all of you .
spencer is still a person of interest
in alison &apos;s murder investigation ,
and now the police seem to think
that you three are also involved .
ian killed alison , okay ?
and last night , he tried to kill me .
we were all there .
we told you exactly what we saw .
and we heard you .
we don &apos;t need to rehash what we talked about last night .
this is about moving forward .
while the police sort through this ,
we want you girls to see a grief counselor .
she is a therapist
who can help you deal with alison &apos;s death ...
and what appears to the police to be
an obsession with
trying to pin her death on ian .
you think we &apos;re lying ?
emily , i believe you ,
but it &apos;s the way it looks that concerns us .
this is a preemptive strike ,
and the goal is to garner both police and public sympathy .
i &apos;m not going to a shrink .
that &apos;s what friends are for .
you can &apos;t be the only one who doesn &apos;t go .
maybe you &apos;ll get more out of it than you think .
this is bull ...
hanna !
do you believe us ?
what i know is that one of my daughters is in the hospital ,
and the other one &apos;s in trouble .
and it &apos;s my job to protect you both .
you didn &apos;t answer the question .
you haven &apos;t heard from ian for a reason . he &apos;s dead .
dead men don &apos;t get up and walk away .
we told you , someone moved the body !
who would do that ? and why ?
is spencer home ?
you shouldn &apos;t be here , toby .
is she okay ?
no , she isn &apos;t .
spencer &apos;s in a lot of trouble ,
and you &apos;re not helping her .
look , whether you &apos;ve earned it or not ,
you have a reputation .
my daughter can &apos;t afford to be seen with you .
i would never do anything to hurt spencer .
good . if you mean that , you &apos;ll stay away from her .
i &apos;m sorry , spencer .
why would jason move back into that house ?
are you sure it was him ?
maybe he &apos;s looking for--
don &apos;t . shh .
if anybody finds out about the jason thing ...
you won &apos;t let that happen .
are you sure you wanna be here ?
i mean , you can stay home for another day .
yeah ? that &apos;d be your home or mine ?
we haven &apos;t had a chance to talk ,
but , um , i heard what you said to me
about your dad ...
mom ... i &apos;m so sorry .
i-- you didn &apos;t really deserve that .
well , actually , maybe i did .
you said exactly what i needed to hear ,
and , um , your dad and i wanted
to tell you and mike this tonight ,
but i think you could use some good news .
i &apos;m going to move back in .
y @-@ you &apos;re not just doing this for me , right ?
no . i @-@ i mean , i &apos;d be lying if i said no , but ...
i &apos;m going it for me , too .
i &apos;m ready to come home .
you need some help with that , mr. fitz ?
you can take your seat , mr. kahn .
what &apos;s up , noel ?
hey , suspension over ?
miss me ?
i think they made the whole thing up to get attention .
i heard ian and spencer were having an affair .
is it possible that &apos;s true ?
you mean that he fell to his death and then disappeared ?
they just got used to everyone looking at them after ali died .
they don &apos;t want to stop .
i don &apos;t know what &apos;s more pathetic ...
people who gossip , or people who listen to gossip .
look at suzy lipton strutting her bony ass
in those skinny jeans .
i heard she lost all that weight drinking rice milk .
what ?
milk ... you can buy it online .
i miss how easy things used to be .
you mean , before you reunited with the others ?
we had so much fun last summer .
and some of it was even legal .
i &apos;m tired of thinking about things .
me too .
maybe i do need therapy ...
as in retell .
i still don &apos;t trust him .
how does noel kahn get suspended ,
and then come back more popular than he was when he left ?
maybe it has something to do with that winning smile .
aria . can i see you a minute ?
i &apos;d like to speak with you about your essay .
you don &apos;t have to go .
i &apos;ll see you in a minute .
are you okay ?
yeah . i &apos;m fine .
do you want to talk about it ?
you wanna tell me what happened ?
uh , not really .
aria , don &apos;t shut me out .
i &apos;m here for you .
i &apos;m not shutting you out . i just ...
don &apos;t really feel like talking to you about it .
i &apos;m sorry i didn &apos;t tell you about jackie ,
and i understand how it looks ,
but you &apos;ll see , she doesn &apos;t change anything .
come over later .
i can &apos;t tonight .
aria , please talk to me .
i don &apos;t know what to say .
things just feel different .
but they &apos;re not different . nothing has changed .
i &apos;m still in love with you .
i can &apos;t do this right now .
are-- are we over ?
i don &apos;t know .
um , is toby here ?
my parents would like you to leave .
he &apos;s not allowed to see you anymore ,
so whatever you had with him ...
it &apos;s over .
wait . jenna ...
you have no idea who you &apos;re dealing with , huh ?
be so easy for me to convince your daddy and my mommy
that you &apos;ve been forcing yourself on me .
oh , no , i didn &apos;t mean to scare you .
what do you want ?
um , emily , this is mr. mendez ,
and he &apos;s the realtor who &apos;s going to be showing the house .
mind if i take a quick look at your room ?
i guess . ah .
well , i like your photos ,
but for the showings you should put them away .
renters like to imagine their own stuff in the house .
nice . small , but generous for a guest bedroom .
of course , you &apos;ll need to paint over this .
aw ... cute .
you thought of leasing the home furnished ?
that was ian &apos;s aunt .
if she hears anything , she &apos;ll call .
any siblings ?
no , his parents are gone , and he &apos;s an only child .
would he have gone to see a friend ?
we contacted everyone .
we figured he was in an accident .
we &apos;ve contacted every hospital in the tri @-@ county area .
he hasn &apos;t been treated for anything .
honey , that &apos;s good news . he &apos;s not hurt .
mom , where is he ?
melissa .
hey , i &apos;m glad you &apos;re home .
we &apos;ve issued an apb on ian &apos;s vehicle ,
and we &apos;re tracking his credit cards ,
so the second we find out anything , you &apos;ll be the first to know .
thank you , officer .
oh , uh , i almost forgot .
we found this in the church .
my phone . thank you .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
hey , listen . as you can see ,
my daughter &apos;s in a very fragile state .
she &apos;s extremely worried .
mr. hastings , finding your son @-@ in @-@ law
is a top priority for the rosewood p.d.
i know you don &apos;t believe me ,
but what i said was the truth .
i don &apos;t know where he is ,
but when ian comes home , we &apos;re leaving this place .
because i don &apos;t want you anywhere near this baby !
he &apos;s not coming home , melissa , ever .
spencer !
if i &apos;m lying , where is he ?
huh ? why isn &apos;t he here ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to figure out .
and right now , spencer ,
you &apos;re just complicating things .
you know what ? you were right about one thing yesterday .
you do have two daughters ,
but you &apos;re only protecting one .
i guess the other one &apos;s just a complication .
sorry i &apos;m late .
but have you been downtown ?
the sales are huge !
you must be hanna . i &apos;m anne .
so , what &apos;d i miss ?
not a thing .
we waited for you .
damn .
thanks for springing for the hotel .
technically , i think it was a motel .
i owe you for this .
no , you don &apos;t owe me anything .
hey , caleb .
i don &apos;t know what you did to hanna ,
but whatever it was , don &apos;t do it again .
it sounds like you credit alison for the friendship .
we became friends because of her .
but she &apos;s gone ,
and the four of you still seem very close .
we weren &apos;t always .
we lost touch when ali went missing .
what brought you back together ?
you don &apos;t all have to agree .
there are no right or wrong answers here .
her death .
she means when they ... when they found her .
when they found her body .
do you think you were looking for closure ?
we were ... looking for answers .
the answer to who murdered alison .
the four of you don &apos;t have to go through this alone .
this is a safe place to talk .
nothing you say here goes beyond these walls .
do we ...
do we want to talk about that thing ?
well , what is it ?
um , i think our time is up .
oh , it &apos;s not &quot; a. &quot; it &apos;s just my mom .
yeah , same here . she wants me to come home .
&quot; what really happened ? &quot;
they found ian &apos;s car by the train station
and $ 10,000 that he took from his bank account .
they think he skipped town and we made up a story
because we knew he left ?
&quot; i spy a liar . &quot;
&quot; a. &quot;
okay , i know what you &apos;re thinking ,
but when i tell you how much money i saved ,
you &apos;ll be very happy ,
and i &apos;ll share the maddens with you
if i can wear them first .
hanna .
okay , fine , you can have the maddens ,
and i &apos;ll just take the betsey johnsons .
i &apos;m going to excuse myself and go try on my new shoes .
you okay ?
yeah . fine .
do you want to sit down , or ...
no .
you &apos;re not allowed to do that .
what ?
you &apos;re not allowed to look at me like that .
and you &apos;re not allowed to do that , either .
i didn &apos;t leave without saying good @-@ bye .
was i unconscious during that exchange ?
i should &apos;ve told you in person , i just ...
i had never said the things that i was feeling ,
and i didn &apos;t feel that i could say those things
without making a complete ass of myself ,
pretty much like i am doing right now .
so , i wrote you a letter ,
and in the letter i said i was sorry .
most of my life , i have felt alone ,
even when i was with people .
that was until i met you .
so , what happened to this letter ?
i gave it to mona .
she said she would give it to you .
um , i appreciate that you ...
came back here to tell me that ,
but doesn &apos;t change what you did .
if you--
if you let me , i--
i know i can make it up to you .
because i love you .
i &apos;ll never be able to forget that you were using me .
i &apos;m sorry .
i believe you .
but ...
you should probably go .
good @-@ bye , hanna .
oh , hanna !
ooh , loving that scarf . did you get that today ?
how could you do that to me ?
do what , sweetie ?
i know about the letter .
the letter ?
the letter caleb left for me .
the one you never gave me , sweetie ?
i thought you were my friend .
i am your friend . that &apos;s why i did it .
no one has ever hurt you the way that he did ,
and i couldn &apos;t give him a chance to do it again .
you had no right to make that decision for me .
sorry . i screwed up , okay ?
i thought i was doing the right thing .
i thought i was protecting you .
you were right about one thing .
caleb really did hurt me ...
but this hurts more .
i &apos;m sorry , hanna .
if i could take it back , i would .
well , you can &apos;t .
sorry i &apos;m late .
are you okay ?
no .
i was hoping we could talk .
emily &apos;s waiting for me .
it &apos;s important .
well , i &apos;m playing catch @-@ up in trig .
that &apos;s your russian history book .
cute outfit . are you wearing it for emily ?
if you &apos;re going to see toby ,
i won &apos;t say anything to mom and dad .
what do you want ?
i &apos;m sorry about what i said ,
about not wanting you around the baby .
we picked a name . taylor .
it works for a boy or a girl .
i like it .
i don &apos;t believe what the police think ,
that ian took that money and left town .
he wanted this baby as much as i do .
so , what are you saying ?
i don &apos;t know where ian is ,
and i &apos;ve run out of places to look .
tell me again what happened at the church .
i &apos;ve told you everything , melissa .
no , i wasn &apos;t listening , but now i am .
so , you believe me ?
i don &apos;t know what to believe ,
but i know ian would never leave me .
you can &apos;t paint over this .
when we leave , 这it &apos;ll be like i was never here .
are you serious ?
my mom is gonna kill me .
no , i promise , i &apos;ll make it look like new .
it &apos;s spencer . she can &apos;t make it .
i &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s nothing you should be sorry about .
actually , there is .
i let you down when i thought you hurt alison .
you didn &apos;t deserve that .
it &apos;s history , okay ?
i never told anyone ,
but i always knew that i was different .
you are .
that &apos;s what &apos;s so great about you .
i got so good at hiding it ,
but you saw it .
i saw the way you looked at maya .
you loved her .
i miss talking to you .
i feel like i &apos;m leaving four friends now .
emily , did you see how easy it was
for us to get back to this place ?
it &apos;ll always be like that .
hey . you &apos;re early .
come in .
really glad you called .
i read yesterday &apos;s paper .
we didn &apos;t lie to the police .
i don &apos;t know what happened to his body ,
but ian &apos;s dead .
i believe you .
i &apos;m sorry you have to go through this alone .
i &apos;m not alone .
i understand , you have your friends ,
but you have me , too .
you just don &apos;t realize it .
you said yesterday that things hadn &apos;t changed .
it feels like they have .
ask me anything , i will tell you the truth .
why did she end it ?
she , uh , thought she was ready for the commitment ,
but she wasn &apos;t .
am i your rebound ?
no . no , but ...
you did help me to get over her .
were you ...
still in love with her when you met me ?
i wish i would &apos;ve known that .
aria , there was not one moment
when we were together that i was thinking about anybody but you .
thank you for being honest .
you know what i love about saturdays ?
it &apos;s that feeling i get when i look up at you
and i realize that we have the whole day to be together .
yeah , i know that feeling .
so , will you stay ?
hey , can i call you tomorrow ?
um , i &apos;m spending the day with my family .
yeah .
i &apos;ll see you on monday .
a had followed me to ezra &apos;s ,
and he , she , &quot; shim , &quot;
must &apos;ve seen me get that key from under the doormat .
let me see that .
okay , i see books , photographs , magazines ...
what ?
is that a playboy ?
what ?
no , right there ,
under that black thing on the cabinet .
that black thing is called a typewriter .
han , that &apos;s not a playboy . that &apos;s a play bill .
i don &apos;t think what &apos;s missing matters .
&quot; a &quot; wants us to know that
she can come and go through ezra &apos;s apartment .
when &apos;s it gonna stop ?
remember where we were a few months ago ?
visiting me in the hospital .
&quot; a &quot; hit hanna and kept on going .
&quot; a &quot; didn &apos;t even hesitate before pushing ian .
it &apos;s almost like it was no big deal .
i don &apos;t want to be sitting next to you guys at another funeral .
you think we should tell the therapist ?
we were really close to telling her yesterday .
it felt so good .
telling anne wouldn &apos;t be like telling our parents .
i mean , she has to keep it a secret , right ?
look , okay , i know we promised garrett
that we wouldn &apos;t show the video to the cops ,
but , i mean , if we want anne to believe us ...
a picture &apos;s worth a thousand words .
you know , she was wearing a gorgeous pair of chloes .
who ?
the shrink .
and this is relevant to this conversation because ... ?
you can tell a lot about a person by their shoes .
i really heard her when she said that
we we don &apos;t have to go through this alone .
do we all agree ?
thank you for seeing us today .
it sounded like there was something
you really wanted to tell me .
there &apos;s also something we wanted to show you .
um , i just want to get one thing straight here .
you &apos;re not allowed to tell
anyone anything that we say in here , right ?
unless you tell me something that leads me to believe
that you &apos;re a danger to yourself or to someone else .
okay . hanna ?
i didn &apos;t know tori made those boots in brown .
are you satisfied ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m good .
go ahead , emily .
i think we should tell her first , and then ...
yeah , sure .
aria ?
we did drift apart after alison went missing ...
and it &apos;s true that her--
her death brought us back together .
毕业于多利斯学院
but i don &apos;t know if we &apos;d be as close as we are now--
this talk is premature .
um , i &apos;m sorry we wasted your time .
what just happened here ?
um , you know , we need to figure out
what we want to say so that we can
communicate more , um , effectively .
and-- and that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do .
so , we &apos;re gonna reschedule .
you girls called me , remember ?
yeah . i @-@ i &apos;m really sorry about this .
well , if she didn &apos;t think we were crazy before ,
she does now .
what was that ?
where did you get this ?
on the bookshelf behind the shrink .
this is what &quot; a &quot; took from ezra &apos;s .
&quot; a &quot; knows we &apos;re coming here .
and that we were gonna tell .
how is &quot; a &quot; always one step ahead of us ?
i &apos;m starting to think that bitch has superpowers .
we &apos;ve gotta tell ezra to change his locks .
come in .
do you have a minute ?
yeah . what &apos;s wrong ?
well , we just got off the phone with your therapist .
and she didn &apos;t tell us what happened today ,
but she did tell us she didn &apos;t think
it &apos;s gonna be helpful
to continue seeing you girls as a group .
yeah . don &apos;t really blame her .
and based on your sessions ,
she &apos;s making a recommendation
that , uh , we &apos;re gonna have to back her up on .
for now .
a recommendation for what ?
she doesn &apos;t believe you girls are capable
of maintaining a healthy friendship at the moment ,
so she &apos;s recommending that you spend some time apart .
yeah , and dr. sullivan said she &apos;s seen this before .
after a traumatic loss , it &apos;s not uncommon
for a close @-@ knit group of
friends to disconnect from the outside world .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re not saying this is forever .
are you telling me that i can &apos;t see my friends ?
i had to see you .
lock the door .
yes , sir .
anyone could &apos;ve sent that , spence .
yeah , and it could just be some kook
trying to mess with melissa .
maybe , but it doesn &apos;t seem random .
&quot; it &apos;s not safe . i can &apos;t tell you &quot; ?
can &apos;t tell you what ?
where he is .
guys , ian is dead . we all saw him .
there &apos;s only one way to know for sure .
send a reply .
how do i know this is you ?
what &apos;s something that only ian would be able to answer ?
hold on . i know .
what are we naming our baby ?
what is the name ?
taylor .
it &apos;s him !
ian &apos;s alive .
i see you found the guest bedroom .
would you like to take a look at the master ?
