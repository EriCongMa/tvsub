and you ... you want to wrap it a little thicker over your knuckles .
let me help you out with that right hand .
you know how to do this ?
yeah , did muay thai , little jiujitsu .
really ?
yeah .
used to spar with my ex @-@ boyfriend .
it was kind of fun until i started beating him .
oh . maybe you should be going out into that ring instead of me .
it &apos;s not too late to call it off .
it &apos;s not gonna look so hot if your nose is over here .
i &apos;m sorry . are you ... you paying me a compliment ?
maybe .
okay , make a fist . tight .
okay .
hey , mcgarrett ?
yup .
you &apos;re up .
all right .

showtime .
showtime .
you did try and talk him out of it , right ?
yeah , i did .
didn &apos;t really work .
clearly .
oh , not that guy .
oh , look at this . this is perfect .

loco moco from rainbow ?
yes , sir .
hope you brought enough for everyone .
special agent kensi blye
from ncis &apos;s los angeles office ,
this is steve mcgarrett .
nice to meet you , sailor .
nice to meet you . ncis , huh ?
yup .
you tell sam that i haven &apos;t forgotten about that steak dinner i owe him ,
but he got to come out here to collect , okay ?
i &apos;d start saving up . man can put away the protein .
here , you can take this one .
thank you .
oh , nice .
what are you doing with that ?
i needed help analyzing the footage .
according to joe , this meeting between governor jameson ,
wo fat and your father was recorded by a surveillance camera
in governor jameson &apos;s office over a year ago .
only you have no idea what he &apos;s saying
because the audio sucks .
what she means is , that the audio file is unrecoverable .
i flew agent blye in from l.a.
she &apos;s an expert lip reader , and we can trust her .
you sure about that ?
is there something i should know ?
um , basically , i owe joe one .
he pulled a few strings
and got me out of a sticky little situation in jakarta ,
so , uh , yeah , you can trust me .
you weren &apos;t supposed to be in jakarta .
you weren &apos;t supposed to know i was in jakarta .
point taken .
what is this called again ?
loco moco . it &apos;s a mixture of rice ,
hamburger , couple fried eggs and gravy .
mmm . separate-- delicious .
together-- heaven . it &apos;s great .
yeah , it &apos;s good . listen , have you got anything yet ?
right . um , so i managed to decipher some of the conversation .
they exchanged pleasantries .
and ... small talk , small talk , small talk
until ... here .
your father says something that gets a reaction .
what did he say ?
he says , &quot; i want to know about shelburne . &quot;
shelburne ?
and then your man wo fat responds by asking ,
&quot; who told you about shelburne ? &quot;
and that &apos;s when your father turns around ,
and i can &apos;t see what his response is ,
but wo fat clearly tensed up at the word &quot; shelburne . &quot;
shelburne .
that mean anything to you ?
no .
me , neither .
well , could be a name of someone , or a street ?
it could be a code for something .
i don &apos;t think so .
i ran it through naval encryption database and didn &apos;t get anything .
mokoto led us to this video .
maybe he knows what shelburne is .
i &apos;m sorry . who &apos;s mokoto ?
really , guys ?
i &apos;ve got level five security clearance .
i can run his name whether you tell me who he is or not ,
so are we gonna do this or what ?
why were you in jakarta ?
another story , another day .
anything you tell me about mokoto stays between us .
mokoto hired my father to investigate governor jameson .
yeah . danny .
i &apos;ll be right there .
i caught a case . i got to go .
thanks for the help , okay ? aloha .
aloha . mahalo for the breakfast .
something tells me he &apos;s not going to let this go .
no .
vic was jake griffin .
the restaurant guy ?
yeah , one and only .
five restaurants in hawaii , 20 on the mainland .
oh , you got to sell a lot of misoyaki butterfish
to buy a place like this , huh ?
never would have pegged you as a butterfish type of guy .
no , i &apos;m not . i &apos;m really not .
my wallet is not , either , but i weaned grace off
of fish sticks onto butterfish ,
and now it is her favorite , so that &apos;s good .
it &apos;s good .
yeah .
pool guy found the body duct @-@ taped to a chair ,
single gunshot wound to the chest .
what we got , lori ?
body was dumped in the pool .
unfortunately , chlorinat water
is quite effective at eliminating trace evidence .
oh , that &apos;s convenient .
or premeditated .
however , based on the size of the contact muzzle burn
and at the entry wound ,
i would hazard a preliminary guess that the victim
was shot with a .38 caliber handgun at point @-@ blank range .
hpd turn up a murder weapon yet ?
not yet . they &apos;re inside processing .
it looks like a robbery gone bad .
how you think this went down , lori ?
well , usually , the most dangerous time
in an encounter like this is before the victim &apos;s restrained ,
&apos;cause usually that &apos;s when a struggle can happen ,
but what bothers me about this is ,
jake was already duct @-@ taped to the chair .
all right , so he poses no threat , he can &apos;t fight back .
so , why shoot him ?
yeah .
several reuben tam paintings taken .
jewelry , silverware , electronics .
okay , so , these thieves definitely knew what they were after .
yeah , hpd says there were
other home invasions in honolulu this week .
same m.o. ?
yeah .
minus the dead guy in the pool .
all right , let &apos;s call hpd ,
let &apos;s make sure we know everything there is
to know about these other home invasion cases .
yeah .
our victim-- he have a family ?
he &apos;s divorced . wife &apos;s on the mainland .
they got one kid .
josh , 14 . lives here .
lives here , huh ? it &apos;s 3 : 15 .
yeah . so ?
school let out 15 minutes ago .
hey , danny , where you going ?
josh .
hey , buddy .
what &apos;s going on ?
why are all these police at my house ?
son , i &apos;m a detective . my name &apos;s danny williams .
where &apos;s my dad ?
come here .
where &apos;s josh ?
i need to see my nephew .
jake &apos;s sister ?
yes.i &apos;m samantha .
is josh okay ?
he &apos;s fine . he &apos;s with one of our detectives .
there &apos;s someone here to see you , buddy .
josh .
oh , god .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
kid makes the lacrosse team today .
he can &apos;t wait to come home and tell his pop .
danny , we &apos;re gonna find the people who did this .
all right , these other two home invasions-- what do we got ?
well , both took place within the last five days
in the same upscale neighborhoods ,
both with the same m.o.
four masked gunmen were waiting for the families
inside their homes .
no signs of forced entry .
these guys duct @-@ taped the men to chairs
and beat them in front of their wives and children
until they gave up the location of their valuables-- unreal .
right , but jake griffin was alone , right ?
josh had not come home from school yet .
mm @-@ hmm , maybe that &apos;s why the situation escalated .
i mean , they had no leverage .
maybe that &apos;s why jake fought back .
yeah , maybe , but why were these people targeted
in the first place ?
what &apos;s the link ? there has to be a link .
well , typically home invaders have been
inside their victims &apos; homes prior to the attack .
they use that opportunity to assess their victims &apos; assets .
all right , so then we cross @-@ check maids , contractors ,
deliveries-- anyone with access to their homes .
yes , start with that .
we &apos;ll talk to the victims ,
see if they remember anything they forgot in the statements .
we already told the other detectives ,
we don &apos;t remember anything .
okay , sometimes being back
in a specific environment that you were at
just prior to a trauma can trigger a memory .
the only thing that you and the other victims have in common
was that you all ate at high @-@ end waikiki restaurants in the days
leading up to the attacks .
restaurants that you frequent at least once a week .
look , we want to help , we do , but
i was duct @-@ taped to a chair and had a gun put to my head
in front of my wife and kids .
i don &apos;t remember much beyond that .
understand .
my kids thought they were going to die .
when a violation of this kind takes place ,
the experience can be extremely traumatic .
it &apos;ll take some time ,
but you will get past it .
try and think back to when you were arriving or when you were leaving .
do you remember anybody bumping into you ?
ask you for directions , use your phone ?
no , nothing like that .
did your purse ever leave your side ?
no , i always keep it on the table so i can see it .
what about your car ?
what , what about it ?
where &apos;d you park ?
uh , down the street .
no , you didn &apos;t .
remember , honey ,
we were running late and you valeted .
no , i parked ......
wait , um , you &apos;re right .
i gave my car to the valet .
do you keep your house keys on the same key chain ?
i do .
why do you ask ?
we &apos;ll be in touch ,
but call us if you remember anything .
thank you .
thank you .
what &apos;s up ?
danny , is there a valet stand out the front of that restaurant ?
yes , there is .
very bright orange and yellow sign-- kokua valet .
let me guess-- you , too .
yeah , i think we just found our link .
kokua valet-- they serviced all the restaurants
where the vics ate , including jake griffin &apos;s place .
yeah , the company has got 20 freelance employees
on the payroll , but get this--
four specific employees all worked together the nights
the victims were at the restaurants .
let me guess , all four of &apos; em were off
the days that the invasions took place .
you got it .
any of these four got a record ?
yeah , one .
oh , dave lockhart ,
proud owner of a string of petty theft and robbery charges .
this guy working tonight ?
nope , and neither are the others .
dave lockhart . five @-@ o. open up .
clear right .
clear left . room clear .
last room clear .
nobody &apos;s home .
they could be on the prowl .
find something ?
yeah , looks like these guys are taking impressions of the keys
on the job , then they come back here , they make copies .
i got molds , i got some kind of polymer gel .
all right , i give you ten to one ,
we check the victim &apos;s locks ,
we find trace evidence of this stuff .
what do you got , chin ?
surveillance pictures .
looks like our suspects cased all the houses before they hit &apos; em .
all right , i know that one .
that &apos;s the laskos &apos; , there &apos;s doroughty &apos;s .
i do not recognize this one . you ?
no .
could be there right now .
i &apos;ll get a picture .
sun &apos;s to the east .
looks like aina haina .
yeah , kono , listen , chin sending you through a photo .
find that house for us right away .
we think they could be hitting it .
just let my family go .
shut up .
don &apos;t hurt him , please .
shut up .
i &apos;ll give you whatever you want .
shut up .
no , stop .
where &apos;s the safe ? huh ? don &apos;t make me ask you again .
how many guys are we looking at here ?
looks like we got three home invaders ,
no sign of the fourth .
hostage count is four . two adults , two children .
looks like they &apos;re already restrained .
laser mic is online .
tell me where it is or you &apos;re all going to die .
in the office behind the plasma .
we got to breach and we got to breach right now . okay , chin ,
lori , you guys take the rear . you two , you &apos;re on me .
we &apos;re moving now .
all right , come on .
go , go .
clear left .
turn around .
i said turn around .
room clear .
let &apos;s see your hands .
room clear .
hands , hands , hands .
turn around and back up to me .
clear .
it &apos;s gonna be all right .
is there anybody else in the house ?
hey ! chin , lori , number four &apos;s coming to you right now .
five @-@ o ! don &apos;t move !
freeze , freeze !
nice work .
how many times i got to tell you , i didn &apos;t kill jake ?
what are you doing ?
why are you , uh-- are you covering for your crew , huh ?
i mean , you know there is no honor amongst thieves .
eventually they will rat on you ,
so why don &apos;t you just beat &apos; em to the punch ?
hey .
hey .
you didn &apos;t miss anything-- this guy &apos;s
vocabulary does not stray too far from the word &quot; lawyer . &quot;
so what happened ?
jake connect the dots , figure out
you were making copies of his customers &apos; keys
and then hitting their homes ?
lawyer .
see what i mean ?
&apos;cause , you see , this wasn &apos;t a random score .
jake was on to you , wasn &apos;t he ?
lawyer .
you go to his hale , ask him not to talk to the cops ,
and then everything goes out the door .
you crazy ?
i never even met the man .
what do you mean you never met the guy ?
you were a valet driver at one of his restaurants .
what , do i look like an idiot ? that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
no , man , the guy &apos;s just a name on a t @-@ shirt .
his sister &apos;s the one that ran the whole operation ,
at least until he kicked her to the curb .
he fired her , why ?
how the hell would i know ? i told you , i never met the man .
look , you think we hit his house ?
go through our stash .
you won &apos;t find a damn thing from jake griffin &apos;s place .
by the way , lawyer .
i called because my findings were highly unusual
and i thought they may be pertinent to your investigation .
great , because we have a suspect in custody
who swears he didn &apos;t murder jake griffin .
oh , how is your sense of smell , agent weston ?
excuse me ?
i detect a hint of strawberry and lavender ,
perhaps even some fresh coconut .
body wash or shampoo ?
max , you &apos;re creeping me out .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , i wasn &apos;t trying to be forward , agent weston .
i was merely trying to prove a point .
sometimes our olfactory senses are our best forensic tools .
okay , olfactory senses .
what are you trying to say ?
you didn &apos;t happen to notice a faint odor
of australian tea tree oil on your suspect , did you ?
i try not to smell the suspects , max . why ?
well , it is just one of several
atypical findings in this case .
when i swabbed the duct tape that bound your victim ,
i was able to recover some traces
of australian tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil
that was preserved on the adhesive side of the duct tape .
as you can see , mr. griffin suffered no trauma
or subdermal bruising of the wrists .
so our vic didn &apos;t put up a fight when he was restrained .
and i believe i know why .
i found high @-@ velocity blood spatter
under the duct tape ,
which would suggest that jake griffin was dead
before he was taped to the chair .
doesn &apos;t make any sense-- i mean , why shoot him
and then tape him to a chair ?
so it turns out that our vic &apos;s sister , samantha martel ,
was dropped from the griffin enterprises payroll a few months ago .
what , was she fired ?
nothing in the record that states that .
when i reached out to the company ,
the party line was that samantha left on her own
to work at jake &apos;s charitable foundation .
and what , is that legit
or is the foundation just code for tax shelter ?
no , n @-@ no , griffin did a lot of good work for the community .
i mean , the guy opened gyms all over the island
to keep kids off the street .
noble but not as profitable .
so i just spoke to griffin &apos;s attorney .
um , it turns out his entire estate and all his restaurants
fall to his son josh
but only after he turns 25 .
and until then , i bet i can guess who &apos;s in control .
the sister samantha .
yeah , looks like she maybe shot her way
back into the restaurant business .
excuse me .
joe .
it &apos;s set .
we &apos;re meeting mokoto tomorrow afternoon , his place ,
1600 hours .
okay , i &apos;ll be there .
hey , uh , is kensi still with you ?
no , i dropped her off
at the airport an hour ago . why ?
oh , i was just wondering .
i mean , you guys seemed to have , uh ,
you seemed to have quite a past .
steve , she &apos;s young enough to be my daughter .
you know something , joe ?
she kind of reminds me of wife number two .
tall , dark , lethal .
seems to be your type .
sorry , you &apos;re breaking up .
is that any way to welcome a houseguest , commander white ?
you must admit that with the lack of suitable hiding places
in this apartment ,
you set the odds firmly in my favor .
what do you want ?
i want to know why you are asking questions
about men that are no longer with us .
i &apos;ll stop asking those questions
when you tell me about shelburne .
what does it mean ?
you &apos;ve done more work than i could have imagined , old man .
would you do me one favor ?
what &apos;s that ?
tell john mcgarrett that his son will be along soon enough .
how &apos;s josh ?
he &apos;s going to need some time to heal ,
but he &apos;s a strong boy .
a lot like his father .
excuse me .
go ahead .
thank you .
has there been any progress in the case ?
as a matter of fact , there has , yeah .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
mrs. martel , uh , where were you
at the time of your brother &apos;s murder ?
i was working at jake &apos;s charitable foundation all day ,
until the police called . why ?
you used to , uh , used to run
a couple of restaurants for jake , right ?
well , yeah , but what does that have to do with anything ?
well , i was just wondering if there were any hard feelings
when your brother fired you .
what ?
no , he didn &apos;t fire me , i quit .
really ? why would you do that ?
i mean , just change careers out of the blue .
okay , look , you don &apos;t understand .
i have always loved that foundation ,
working with those kids .
when a position opened up ,
jake offered me a job full @-@ time .
i don &apos;t have anything to do with the restaurants anymore .
yeah , that was true yesterday ,
but now that jake &apos;s passed , you &apos;re in control .
what-- no , that &apos;s-- jake &apos;s will ?
that &apos;s about taking care of josh .
look , i don &apos;t care what you think .
i did not kill my brother .
okay .
gonna have to ask you , uh , mrs. martel , do you own a gun ?
well , i mean , it &apos;s not really mine .
uh , jake had a gun .
well , you see , there was nothing registered
in either of your names , ma &apos;am .
well , no , it wouldn &apos;t have been registered .
jake found out that one of the guys that he was helping
with his charity got ahold of a gun , and he took it away .
where &apos;s the gun now ?
hands up . hands up .
jake wanted to build a place
where underprivileged kids could come and be safe .
all of these kids can come and train for free .
hey , mrs. martel .
just need you to sign a couple things .
what , you in the market for some cleaning products ?
fighters use these to wipe down after they train .
uh , kills ringworm , staph , mrsa .
hey , look what they &apos;re made from .
australian tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil .
those are the same oils that max found
on the duct tape he pulled off our vic .
yeah . we &apos;re good .
all right , good job .
jake &apos;s gun &apos;s right in there .
honey , is everything all right ?
they need the gun .
for what ?
they think that i killed jake .
what ?
mr. martel , i &apos;m going to ask you to just step back , all right ?
no gun .
what @-@ what do you mean ? it &apos;s got to be there .
well , it &apos;s not .
when was the last time you saw it ?
i don &apos;t know , maybe a couple weeks ago .
hey , it &apos;s all right .
you didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
all right ?
okay , um , who else knew about this gun , besides you two ?
just jake and i.
well , and boriero .
who &apos;s boriero ?
one of the fighters who trains here .
that &apos;s the kid i mentioned .
jake took the gun off of him ,
said that if he wanted to train here ,
he had to stay out of trouble .
that was one of jake &apos;s only rules about this place .
okay , fine . where &apos;s he at ? is boriero here ?
no , he hasn &apos;t trained here for a few weeks .
why is that ?
he left after an argument with my brother about going pro ,
said that he wanted a sponsorship .
but jake said that the foundation wasn &apos;t about that .
all right .
you know where boriero lives ?
vitor boriero .
he went away in 2009 for taking part in an armed robbery .
he strong @-@ armed the owner of a kapiolani beer joint
and then cleaned out the safe .
this guy sounds like a complete gentleman .
guy drives an &apos; 82 jeep
cj @-@ 7 , black .
it should give you heads up if he &apos;s home .
am i driving ? of course i &apos;m driving .
all right , thanks .
oh , and one more thing . word to the wise :
boriero &apos;s trained .
i would not engage him hand @-@ to @-@ hand .
that &apos;s not going to happen .
i like my gun .
there &apos;s the jeep .
looks like he &apos;s home .
doesn &apos;t look like boriero &apos;s worried about theft .
that &apos;s one of the benefits of being built like king kong .
not gonna believe this .
what do you got ?
he &apos;s obviously not very bright .
plain sight .
we have a beautiful .38 caliber .
same caliber as the murder weapon .
what you guys doing ?
boriero , five @-@ o.
show me your hands right now . get on the ground .
on the ground . hey !
no , no , no , no !
no , no , no , no ! come on !
door , door !
my shoulder , my shoulder !
my shoulder ! huh ?
i was supposed to fight tomorrow , man .
yeah , plenty of chances to fight where you &apos;re going , boriero .
you &apos;re going away , you understand ?
going away for what ?
we found jake &apos;s murder weapon in your jeep .
you know that gun ain &apos;t mine . you planted it .
you good ?
yeah .
yeah ?
&quot; do not engage in hand @-@ to @-@ hand . &quot;
do you remember that ?
i must &apos;ve forgot .
must &apos;ve forgot it . okay .
hey , tell me something .
what ?
when did max say the time of death was ?
uh , between 9 : 00 and 10 : 00 a.m. why ?
&apos;cause this guy didn &apos;t do it .
according to this ,
you were in the hospital yesterday morning .
yeah .
i was sparring the night before , took a head punch .
figured i should get that checked out .
all right , well , i hope that the head punch
didn &apos;t mess with your memory too much ,
because we got some questions we want to ask you .
you really think i killed jake ?
how do we know this isn &apos;t just a stab at an alibi ?
i might be able to fake a wristband ,
but you can &apos;t fake a ct scan . call the hospital .
oh , we got somebody doing that .
in the meantime , why don &apos;t you tell us
how the gun that killed jake griffin
ended up in your jeep ?
jeep &apos;s wide open .
anyone could have planted that .
why would someone do that ?
why would i shoot jake ?
without that gym , i &apos;d still be on the streets .
i don &apos;t know .
old habits die hard .
jake called me a loser to my face .
not many men have the stones to say that to me ,
but he was right , and i respected him for it .
i believe that . you did respect him , up until the point
where he wouldn &apos;t give you a sponsorship .
you got it all wrong .
lot of money in mma these days .
i mean , you turn pro , you get a couple of pay @-@ per @-@ view fights .
we &apos;re talking about a lot of money .
it &apos;s a lot of money , but jake was not interested in that .
right ? he didn &apos;t want his charity to turn into a business .
you guys fought over it , and when it did not
go your way , you shot him .
that &apos;s crazy !
look , did i want to go pro ?
sure . who wouldn &apos;t ?
but i turned down marshall &apos;s offer ,
but he wouldn &apos;t let it go .
oh , marshall ?
jake &apos;s brother @-@ in @-@ law-- what does he have to do with this ?
he said he &apos;d train me , manage me , the whole shot .
even asked me if i could recruit a couple of the other guys , too .
how much commission was he asking for ?
20 % .
20 % . when was the last time you saw him ?
he came by yesterday to break the news about jake .
said he didn &apos;t want me to hear it on tv .
was your jeep parked in front when he came by ?
yeah . always in the same spot .
all right , so i looked into marshall martel like you asked ,
and i found something very interesting .
according to his credit card statement ,
yesterday morning , he spent $ 84
at a hardware store five blocks from the crime scene .
check out what he bought .
duct tape and cleaning supplies .
check out the time stamp .
10 : 17 .
that &apos;s right around tod .
hey ! marshall !
hang on . just finishing up .
no , you &apos;re all finished . come on , you &apos;re done .
take five .
what are you talking about ?
talking about the fact that you killed jake griffin .
excuse me ?
yeah . then you went to the hardware store
to cover up the crime , which is a good indication
to me that you weren &apos;t planning on killing him .
right , but when you did ,
you wanted the cops to be looking the other way ,
so , you covered it up and made it look like
one of those home invasion crimes you saw on the news .
what &apos;s going on ?
hands behind your back . come on .
marshall , why are they arresting you ?
marshall , say something .
ma &apos;am , i &apos;m sorry about this .
marshall , say something !
marshall ? !
it was an accident .
i was just trying to scare him .
what ? he was my brother .
he had all the money in the world .
and all i wanted was a little something for us .
something so that we wouldn &apos;t have to come to him
with hat in hand anymore , but he just wouldn &apos;t listen .
so , what , you killed him ?
we were arguing , he went for the gun , it went off , and i ...
i panicked .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
excuse me .
pardon me , wahine . excuse me , brother . pardon me .
sure , make sure everybody gets some , brah .
oh , good seats , huh ?
that is , um , a lot of popcorn , even for you , kamekona .
oh , give me some kakimochi .
air @-@ popped . healthy kind , sistah .
you guys hungry ?
don &apos;t mind if i do .
oh , easy , brah !
no more refills over here .
i know this is for charity , but this is crazy .
right ? even for mcgarrett .
so , his opponent ...
it says in his statistics here
that he &apos;s 21 and eight , with 13 tko &apos;s .
what &apos;s a tko ?
it means that 13 of his opponents were unable
to continue fighting him .
oh , so that &apos;s a good thing then ?
