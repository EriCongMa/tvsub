cece went on a date last night ?
schmidt , why don &apos;t you just read my text messages
while i &apos;m in the shower like you normally do ?
our cece has taken a lover ?
good for him .
don &apos;t get weird , schmidt .
i &apos;m not being weird . i just said good for him .
you know , i &apos;ve camped in that forest , too .
the babbling brook , the beautiful mountains ,
little secret trailway that &apos;s only open seasonally ,
and when it is-- let me tell you something--
bring a camera .
cool , not weird at all .
good , you &apos;re all here .
i just got a tip from my buddy dugan .
my academy background check
is today and i need everybody &apos;s help .
can &apos;t do it , bro .
going to the outlet mall today--
what ?
i &apos;m gonna look like a rich person from three years ago .
can &apos;t ... you can &apos;t go to the outlet mall today .
not today . yeah , you can &apos;t go to the outlet mall today .
why ?
it &apos;s a weekend-- what are you , crazy ?
unless you got a game plan .
i have a game plan .
grab a quick smoothie , power up . do my leg stores first .
pants , socks , shoes .
hats and accessories last ,
then one sweet treat for the road .
most likely a cinnamon pretzel .
i &apos;m in .
that sounds like a tight afternoon .
i &apos;m in for sure .
what the hell , dude ?
i do want to be part of the pretzel .
this is my life .
if i don &apos;t pass the background check ,
then i fail out of the police academy .
guys , this is an all @-@ hands @-@ on @-@ deck situation .
if we don &apos;t help him , winston will never become a cop .
remember ?
he @-@ he handcuffed his cat &apos;s paw to a radiator
and then lost the key .
in my defense , i was making a christmas card , so ...
okay , you know what-- i &apos;m gonna cancel my plans with cece .
i &apos;ll find out about her date with paul later .
a ridiculous name .
oh , hey , my name is puh @-@ ha ... pau ...
i don &apos;t even know how to pronounce that .
it &apos;s paul .
i &apos;ll take that paul ,
i &apos;ll take him to a water park , i will .
i &apos;ll put him on one of those waterslides
between two obese people and he &apos;ll get smushed to death .
die in a ... die in a water ...
he &apos;ll die between the obese people
before he drowns in the water .
what ?
hmm ? schmidt ,
that is exactly the kind of talk
we can &apos;t have today when the lapd comes here .
um ... the , uh , cops are coming here ?
yes .
like , here , here ?
yes .
like , to our home ,
w @-@ where we keep our stuff ?
why can &apos;t we just go there ?
we &apos;ll just go there , a @-@ answer some questions ,
get an ice coffee on the way back--
i really feel like ice coffee .
it &apos;s a home visit , jess .
and not just from any cop .
it &apos;s from sergeant tess dorado . the fish .
i &apos;m pretty sure they call her the fish
because she &apos;s tough but fair ,
just like most fish i &apos;ve interacted with .
winston , &quot; dorado &quot; is a fish .
it &apos;s a subset of mahi @-@ mahi
and it pairs very nicely with citrus , you oaf .
i &apos;m not a oaf , you &apos;re a oaf , stupid .
so ... you &apos;re dumb . shut up .
also , put on some underpants , please .
it &apos;s like a bounce house down there .
do you guys think that the cops are gonna go through our stuff ?
what are you afraid of ? they &apos;ll look through your dream journal ?
no , i just ...
what , are you running a sweatshop
back there for skirts that look like curtains ?
actually ...
what &apos;d you @-@ what &apos;d you , steal a kiss
and hide it in an envelope ?
i have a bag of meth in my closet .
第四季 第六集
oh , i know it &apos;s in here somewhere ...
oh , oh , ooh . these are my &quot; bad decision &quot; hats .
bad decision , right ?
how do you not know where a bag of meth is ?
find it and get rid of it .
find it , get rid of it .
jess ,
why do you have meth in your closet ?
do you remember that day when i was trying to convince you guys
to come with me to that waffle restaurant
in the antelope valley that i found ?
and you were like , &quot; that &apos;s way too far to go for waffles . &quot;
turns out you were right-- how good can a waffle really be ?
that &apos;s the question i answered that ...
tell us the story faster .
your waffle story sucks .
where is the bag of crystal methamphetamine , you dummy ?
okay , fine . do you see that footstool ?
i bought it at a garage sale .
turns out the top opens up
and when i opened up the top ,
i found ... here it is ...
this .
holy frickin &apos; what ?
oh , hey . how do i look ?
terrible .
n @-@ not for me . not great .
like crap .
go change .
i don &apos;t like any of it .
wow . you guys are like rubbing alcohol .
you sting me in the now , but save me in the later .
all right .
okay , winston cannot find out about this .
because if he doesn &apos;t know , he can &apos;t get in trouble ,
and he &apos;s probably already failing out of the academy as it is .
also , why are you keeping this in your closet ?
what am i supposed to do ,
notify the authorities ?
i &apos;m sorry , officer ,
i found this bag of meth in a footstool
i bought at a garage sale .
uh , no .
my closet is safe . the only person who goes in there
is me when i &apos;m naked and / or sad .
hey . much better , right ?
i found it on the lawn .
and that &apos;s the whole story .
so , you guys ready ? she &apos;s on her way .
why don &apos;t you go wait for her downstairs ?
don &apos;t make her buzz up like a shawarma boy .
good idea , good idea .
this way , i get to tell her my sidewalk joke .
you remember the sidewalk joke , right ?
there &apos;s a man on the s ...
how &apos;s it ... ? there &apos;s a man on the ...
oh , you know , okay ...
everybody just calm down .
especially you , nick , you &apos;re already sopping wet .
lying makes me sweat . i can &apos;t lie .
it &apos;s why i don &apos;t play poker or talk to pregnant ladies .
no one has to lie . i &apos;m just going to get rid of it .
i &apos;m gonna call cece .
she knows about this stuff .
she lived one summer in milan
with a guy named crystal randy .
ask her about the date .
hey , cece ,
quick question . how does one get rid of a bag of meth ?
ask her if paul is taller than me .
call me back . stop it .
did she surrender her virtue ?
throw it in the trash .
i can &apos;t see it .
i can &apos;t see where it goes , &apos; cause then when she comes
in here , i &apos;ll just yell &quot; trash ! &quot; i &apos;ll yell &quot; trash ! &quot;
cover your ears and sing &quot; landslide . &quot;
let &apos;s call cece again .
* took my love and i took it down *
we need to get this back in my closet ...
i could see your lips moving .
well , close your eyes .
throw it out the window , okay ?
i &apos;ll sneak down there ,
i &apos;ll toss it in the dumpster . here .
oh , my god !
what the heck , jess ?
i threw like a boy !
i &apos;ve always thrown like a boy !
you almost hit me in the face !
what are you , nuts ?
overhand ?
oh , well , winston &apos;s a goner .
you know , this building used to be a biscuit factory .
and apparently , the mice have not been told
it &apos;s gone residential .
was that a joke ?
i hate jokes .
oh , my god , oh , my god , oh , my god .
we just have to hide this .
throw it in here .
come on !
i was bringing it to you !
why does everybody keep asking me to throw stuff ?
work on your aim !
this is actually a really good song .
nick , stop singing !
where are we gonna put this ?
put it in the baggie !
fun saturday ?
no . my bird died .
well , my mom used to say
when a bird dies ,
he gets another set of wings in heaven , so ...
well , that bird was going straight to hell .
welcome to our home .
i will ask you questions . you will ask me no questions .
in pursuit of that ,
i will offer up three personal facts :
i was born in st. louis ,
i have three brothers , two of whom
were killed in separate plane crashes ,
and ...
i like music .
good ? good .
now , let &apos;s get started--
my name is nick .
nicholas miller ?
i @-@ i don &apos;t ... i don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s just messing around with you .
he &apos;s our resident clown here .
let &apos;s keep this simple .
i need to be home in time to feed my bird .
oh , god .
uh , green grape ? would you like ... ?
no , thanks .
i already had my grapes .
jess !
i got your message .
where &apos;s the freaking me ...

what &apos;s up , cece ?
ah , it &apos;s his girlfriend cece .
girlfriend ? oh , my goodness ,
you guys are back together ?
yeah .
no , uh ...
like i always say , you can &apos;t put
peanut butter and jelly on the same shelf
and expect &apos; em not to mix .
&apos;cause somebody got to eat a sandwich .
it &apos;s exciting .
yeah , no .
moving on . miss day ,
in your own words , please state
why cadet bishop would be an asset
to the los angeles police department .
a few kind words . known me for a long time .
yeah .
it &apos;s your boy winnie the bish . oh !
i have to go to the bathroom .
if you guys will excuse me for just one second .
okay .
will somebody answer the question so i can write it
on the form and we can get on with our lives ?
why would bishop make a good police officer ?
mustache .
i &apos;m sorry ?
because , uh , winston has a mustache .
and , uh , police officers all have mustaches .
no , they don &apos;t . not the ladies .
unless the ladies want to .
why can &apos;t a lady have a mustache ?
she can . and it would look sexy .
would you like a green grape shoved in your ...
given to your mouth ? handed to your mouth ?
i &apos;m asking a simple question ,
unless you don &apos;t think
he would be an asset to the lapd .
no , he @-@ he would . he definitely would .
yeah , he would .
you know , winston has done plenty for , uh ,
the , um ... community .
he has a little brother at the boys &amp; girls club .
of course . all the work that winston does
with the boys &amp; girls club that he actually does in real life .
so much work at the boys &amp; girls club .
yeah . so passionate .
what was his little brother &apos;s name again ?
duke .
juan .
duquan is his name .
duquan .
duquan .
and i &apos;m nick miller .
hey , let me ask you s ... um ...
breasts .
it &apos;s my cycle .
already ?
damn , girl . my calendar is way off on you .
you must be , what , like , ten days early ?
winston . someday you &apos;re gonna make some lucky girl
really uncomfortable . can you go get cece
and tell her to meet me in the bathroom ?
sure . and , girl , uh , you ain &apos;t got a cycle--
you got a roller coaster .
don &apos;t i know it , girl ?
duquan feldman ?
i &apos;m gonna make a note to call the boys &amp; girls club .
no !
why not ?
because he &apos;s coming here .
why would ... why would duquan come @-@ come here ?
because he comes here every saturday .
he does ?
then where is he ?
it &apos;s saturday . where is he ?
he &apos;s at the bus station . he &apos;s waiting for
one of us to get him , and
you know what ? i &apos;ll go do it . you guys stay put .
you &apos;re gonna go and get duquan ?
i think so .
yeah .
you guys , anybody want to ...
come ... with ? no ?
where are you , duquan ?
cece , jess needs some help
with some lady stuff .
of course .
you know how we do .
gonna ...
must be a rough one .
you know what ,
i &apos;m gonna have a look around .
what a great i ... you know what , you should start
with nick and i &apos;s room . we share it .
don &apos;t mind the condoms . we &apos;ve been banging like rabbits .
not each other .
what are you doing ? jessica .
no , jessica ! what are you doing ?
you do not put drugs down the shower drain .
have you never seen a drug movie before ?
i don &apos;t know . i saw ray .
that does not count .
i might have ruined winston &apos;s chances of being a cop .
well , we can cry about that later .
we are gonna take the drugs now
and we &apos;re gonna go flush &apos; em , all right ?
what are you doing ?
come on . help me . pick up the drugs , jess .
i think that the meth entered my bloodstream
through my boob skin .
that is not a thing .
that &apos;s not how drugs work .
i &apos;m the one on meth !
don &apos;t tell me how drugs work !
okay .
oh , my god .
could you open this trunk ?
oh , i &apos;ll do more than open it .
i don &apos;t know why i said that .
i &apos;m gonna open the trunk .
i think i &apos;m having a heart attack .
what are you ... oh , my god .
you &apos;re a mess . here .
cover up . cover ...
no , i &apos;m not putting that ...
i &apos;m not putting on your kimono .
it legitimizes you owning it . just put it on .
put it on .
okay .
i &apos;m wearing a kimono .
i see that . why ?
why ? why is he still wearing pants ?
that &apos;s the real question .
what &apos;s all that going on out there ?
i &apos;m on drugs .
i &apos;m on drugs ...
what &apos;s all that clanging ?
just a bunch of clanging .
well , there &apos;s feminine issues ...
it &apos;s probably the ladies playing with their jewelry .
their brooches .
you know how ... brooches . of course .
nick makes a very good point .
i &apos;m gonna go check on that right now , actually .
winston ,
why don &apos;t you show the good sergeant
jess &apos; room ?
what
what a great idea .
oh , i &apos;ve had intercourse in there .
you &apos;ll be excited to ...
i think i &apos;m gonna take off , too .
nick , what is going on out there ?
what &apos;s going on out there ?
no , i &apos;m asking you what &apos;s going on .
what &apos;s going on ?
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
hey , what happened to the &quot; turlet &quot; ?
schmidt , you &apos;re here . so we &apos;re in a little bit
of a thing right now , but you &apos;re our best cleaner .
we might be out of towels , but you &apos;ll figure out something .
right ? it &apos;s gonna be fun .
jess , are you crying right now ?
i don &apos;t know .
i hadn &apos;t noticed . um ...
i might be on drugs .
you gonna help mop or are you just gonna try to kiss me again ?
oh , please . you kissed me back . your ...
i felt your lips surrender . and who &apos;s this paul anyway ? paul .
what , does he work in a pizzeria ?
yes , schmidt ,
i went on a date with a guy named paul .
you just need to get over it .
paul . paul . nice name , dude .
why is your shirt off ?
i &apos;ve seen new jack city , okay ?
they all take their shirts off in the crack cocaine lab !
ah , it won &apos;t go down !
hats off to the hillbilly that made this meth .
meth ?
what meth ?
this meth .
it &apos;s ... legal meth .
it &apos;s ... medical meth .
for my ... cramps .
wait a minute . who &apos;s with nick ?
* i took my love and i took it down *
* i drove around and i hit a pound *
* and i saw all the puppies with their *
* eyes so blind *
nick !
sergeant dorado ,
don &apos;t listen to him ! he &apos;s deranged !
i &apos;m gonna talk to this man alone .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
that is not good .
no .
so , this paul ...
i &apos;ve never seen someone sweat so much in my life .
it looks like your body is crying .
what are you hiding ?
distraction !
okay . you &apos;re a tough cookie .
and that &apos;s the last thing i &apos;ll say .
okay , you want the truth ? i &apos;ll tell you everything .
when i was 13 years old ,
i once made love to myself behind a post office .
yo ! what &apos;s up ? you in the shorts .
hey , come here , man . come here . i need a little boy .
whoa . no . that &apos;s not what i meant . no , no , no .
i didn &apos;t mean ... you know what i &apos;m ... ah .
i wasn &apos;t trying to ...
it &apos;s for my friend , you know ?
i need you to come over to , uh , hang out with my friends .
no , not like that . i just need you to pretend
like , uh , you &apos;re in a relationship
with this grown man that i know .
i did not think this through . did not think this through .
um , bad decision . very bad decision .
i &apos;m gonna go now . don &apos;t remember my face .
forget this face . this didn &apos;t happen .
what is wrong with the name paul , okay ?
paul is a normal name . he is a normal guy .
that is the problem , okay ?
you shouldn &apos;t be with a normal guy .
all right , okay .
it was mark @-@ paul gosselaar .
what ? you ... you were ... you were with zack morris ?
guy &apos;s a frigging god .
i mean , all right . i &apos;ve ... i surrender .
that &apos;s awes ... can i come to the wedding ?
you think slater and screech are gonna be there ?
i &apos;m kidding . i just wanted to see you freak out .
you really had me going there for a second .
it works every time with you .
it &apos;s amazing . now ...
there was a real second there where i had bad feelings
towards mark @-@ paul gosselaar ,
and i didn &apos;t like any moment of that .
how dare you . don &apos;t ever do that to me again .
when i was nine years old ,
i fed cereal flakes to a frog , and it died .
then i went into a period of time
where i fed cereal flakes to all little animals .
squirrels can live through it , chipmunks can live through it .
anything that lives half in and out of water dies ,
and i don &apos;t understand why .
when i was ten , i once walked by my mother sleeping ,
and i snuck in the room , and i put a lemon in her mouth .
when i was 11 , i once tried on my girl cousin &apos;s wool tights ,
and i didn &apos;t hate the way it felt !
why are you telling me this ?
because you said you wanted to hear everything !
my sixteenth year , i never got an erection .
i thought they were done .
i thought my penis was dead .
it wasn &apos;t .
it &apos;s fine , winston . we can fix this .
just help me mule this crank .
i &apos;ll prepare , you mule .
i can &apos;t mule crank . i don &apos;t have the system .
it &apos;s the perfect plan . i don &apos;t think it is .
jess , do you know how much time we could get
for possessing this much meth ? why &apos;d you hide it from me ?
i was trying to protect you .
i should &apos;ve been the first person you told !
i could &apos;ve taken care of it , or something .
now it just looks like we &apos;re hiding it .
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t think there was anything you could do .
and @-@ and why is that ?
because ... i don &apos;t know !
because you don &apos;t see me as a cop . none of you do .
i didn &apos;t ... i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d make it this far .
we always thought you &apos;d change your mind .
i mean ...
you say a prayer every time you get on a escalator .
why risk it ?
i just ...
never really saw you as a ... as a cop .
sorry .
oh , there it is .
okay . okay .
you know what ? i know exactly what i have to do .
i &apos;m gonna tell her it &apos;s mine .
what ? ! no . no .
yes . maybe i &apos;m not supposed to be a cop .
there &apos;s no reason you should lose your job , too .
i once changed a sign that said &quot; happy jewish new year &quot;
to &quot; happy newish jew year . &quot;
is that a hate crime ?
stop talking , stop sweating .
what is wrong with you people ? ! enough !
sarge , i have something i need to tell you .
wait ! sergeant !
my name is jessica day ,
and this is my meth .
what ? !
jess , no . i won &apos;t accept that . so ...
the bathroom is covered in meth .
meth that belongs to me .
and it may have intoxicated me
through the skin on my breasts .
but i assure you , no one here had
any prior knowledge of any of this .
especially winston .
and i don &apos;t want him to go down for my mistake .
you &apos;d be lucky to have him as a cop .
take me downtown to the all @-@ lady fur factory .
okay , cuff me .
somebody bring me handcuffs . i &apos;m guilty .
is she cuffing me ?
i can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on up there .
do you feel anything ?
does meth make you feel , like , normal ,
but , like ... like your face feels , like , scratchy ?
oh , no , that &apos;s just the carpet on my face .
here &apos;s the way this is gonna go down .
i &apos;m gonna go in the bathroom , have a look around .
you will stay here .
you will not move ,
you will not talk ,
you will not think
unless they &apos;re thoughts about not moving .
winston , i &apos;m so sorry .
i ruined everything .
you would have been such a good cop .
you would have made someone really lucky
to have you as a partner .
i always imagined i &apos;d have a partner named robertson .
that would have been perfect .
yeah .
&quot; robertson , you &apos;re on the edge !
&quot; you &apos;ve gone too far ! &quot;
no , no , no .
see , the thing about me and robertson is that we &apos;re tight .
you know , then i went ahead and slept with his wife .
why would you do that ?
i don &apos;t know why ...
i don &apos;t know why i would do that .
the job really gets to you .
you know , it &apos;s stressful out there .
this might not be the right moment but ...
for what it &apos;s worth , i did it .
i kept a secret .
well , congratulations , nick .
you have the willpower of a six @-@ year @-@ old .
oh , thank you .
i &apos;m sorry about the whole kissing thing .
oh , you don &apos;t have to apologize .
i did ... kiss you back a little .
so , should we tell paul together ?
well , what do you think he &apos;s doing right now ?
do you think he &apos;s explaining to the air @-@ brusher
that that really is his name ? paul ?
and that he wants that painted
across the back of his denim jacket ?
it &apos;s a normal name .
hey , nick ?
when i &apos;m in prison , write , dance , sing ...
live your life .
and if you come and visit me in jail ,
please don &apos;t wear that robe .
it &apos;s a kimono .
well , this is a first .
these are aquarium rocks .
so , that &apos;s the street name for ...
no . these are actual aquarium rocks .
you were trying to flush rocks down your toilet .
oh , what ? !
oh , that &apos;s ridiculous .
that &apos;s great !
yes ! awesome !
so we &apos;re not going to prison ?
so , did winston pass the background check ?
of course . he &apos;s one of our best cadets .
his test scores are high , he &apos;s passionate , hardworking .
he &apos;s gonna make one hell of a cop .
but he won &apos;t work in narcotics .
you get to be a cop !
congrat ... congrat ...
congratulate ...
really ?
no , we &apos;re celebrating winston .
celebrating winston .
okay . all right , we &apos;ll celebrate winston .
oh . yeah .
excuse me . please consider moving .
i have no idea
why you live with these people .
what kind of person would urinate on an electrical socket ?
i ... i thought it would make lightning .
i told you that wouldn &apos;t work , nick .
guess who &apos;s here like he normally is every saturday !
it &apos;s duquan !
big brother wimstons .
i love you , mr. wimstons .
i go from no hope to hope .
he take me and he says to me , &quot; you &apos;re gonna be somebody .
you @-@ you could be the presidents ,
or statues of liberties . &quot;
is that right ?
we make homework togethers .
he buys me toys , and we chase each others ,
and we laugh at the sun .
this feels good , man .
yeah .
like i got a new friend .
me , too .
duquan .
right .
hanging out .
it &apos;s jose , so ...
yeah , i like duquan , though .
yeah , but my name &apos;s jose .
like outlet malls ?
i love outlet malls .
ah , me too , man .
yeah .
yeah . that &apos;s awesome .
on the weekend , though ?
yeah , but i mean , i have a strategy , you know .
like , i start out with a smoothie ,
and then do my leg stores first .
then , i ...
yeah . i do the same , but i end it with pretzel .
pretzel . i ...
shut up .
cinnamon pretzel ?
oh , my god .
dude , don &apos;t , don &apos;t , don &apos;t .
no , you don &apos;t .
no , you don &apos;t .
