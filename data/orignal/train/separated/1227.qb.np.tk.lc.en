alison dilaurentis planned and carried out
the murder of mona vanderwaal .
hanna has been arrested .
but we &apos;ll figure this out .
no one is gonna believe us .
getting a little tired of memorializing mona .
are you saying that the world &apos;s better off without her ?
i have done a lot to get that .
i did it to protect the one person
that matters most to me .
you didn &apos;t kill anyone .
no .
but i let a lot of things happen that i shouldn &apos;t have .
have you reached a verdict ?
guilty of murder in the first degree .
there is nothing you can do .
it is too late to help her or her friends .
they chose to help the wrong person .
i didn &apos;t think i could feel worse after &quot; a &quot; killed mona .
but the four of us getting arrested for her murder
brings low to a whole new level .
technically , they think that we &apos;re accessories , not killers .
an accessory is a necklace or a handbag ,
not a chain gang .
call it what you want .
we &apos;re all going to jail .
&quot; a &quot; wins .
why do you think they &apos;re separating us from ali ?
there &apos;s a lady in the laundry .
if you do her work , she gives you information .
yesterday she told me that the warden received an anonymous tip .
they think the five of us are plotting something big .
what , and they think ali &apos;s the big bad wolf ?
but does that make us the little pigs or little red ?
doesn &apos;t matter .
a wolf can &apos;t lead without her pack .
when we get there ,
they &apos;re probably going to split us up , too .
what &apos;s it like , han ?
do you want me to sugarcoat it or tell you the truth ?
well , if i &apos;m going to get through it ,
i need to know what to expect .
the second they slam that door shut , you feel ashamed .
this is crazy . we didn &apos;t do anything .
they don &apos;t care about that .
they treat you like a criminal ,
and it &apos;s hard to remember that you &apos;re not one .
the first night &apos;s the hardest .
you &apos;re locked away from everything
and everyone you ever cared about .
and when they turn those lights out ,
it is the loneliest feeling you could ever imagine .
second thought , i could have used a thick coat of sugar .
you can &apos;t be ready for how it feels , em .
it &apos;s hard not to give up on hope .
you guys , they can take everything from us ,
but they can &apos;t take us from each other .
i don &apos;t care how far apart from you guys i am ,
i will still be with you .
me , too .
same here .
i love you , guys .
love you .
what the hell was that ?
we just had an accident .
yeah , i did in my pants .
oh , my god .
oh , my god . get back . get back !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
we think the transport officers were neutralized
with an injection of flunitrazepam .
the date rape drug ?
the deputies regained consciousness this morning
with no memory of the incident .
the girls were wrongfully accused to begin with .
and now they &apos;re all missing ?
let &apos;s get our facts straight .
the incident was an abduction .
yeah , but who would want to take the girls ?
should we be asking who would or who could ?
if mona was alive ...
i keep thinking this feels like that .
no . no .
there &apos;s only been one person at the center of any trouble
the girls have gotten into .
you think alison &apos;s behind this ?
alison &apos;s a master manipulator ,
but she doesn &apos;t have access
to what was needed to pull off something this elaborate .
why these girls ?
what would make them somebody &apos;s target ?
well , the good news is tanner wants to keep this
out of the press .
no one knows about this yet .
wait , not even the other girls &apos; parents ?
we have to keep this between us .
we don &apos;t want a civilian mob out there
being told to shoot first and ask questions later .
but if they think our daughters are fugitives ,
isn &apos;t that what tanner &apos;s telling the police to do ?
you &apos;re damn straight it is .
all units in the vicinity of whitewood and stuckey ,
possible domestic violence ...
could you just give me one second please ?
now alison may still be locked up ,
but she has access to people .
we both know what she &apos;s capable of .
mom ?
mom !
hello ?
can anybody hear me ?
aria ?
hanna , spencer ?
is anybody here ?
what the ...
jn @-@ 49163 @-@ b
please exit your room and follow the lighted pathway .
oh , my god .
is everybody okay ?
what is this place ?
i think this is &quot; a &apos;s &quot; house .
more like &quot; a &apos;s &quot; dollhouse .
yeah , and we &apos;re the dolls .
please follow the lighted pathway .
please follow the lighted pathway .
we heard you , bitch .
ali , is that you ?
oh , my god !
mona ?
mona ?
i know it &apos;s been a while ,
but i haven &apos;t changed that much , have i ?
you guys , it &apos;s me ...
alison .
caleb got into the pd &apos;s command center .
and if you cross @-@ check the van &apos;s gps system
with the pd &apos;s system , it goes dead right here .
on route 30 , near the railroad crossing .
that &apos;s when &quot; a &quot; hacked into the van &apos;s computer system
and took remote control of the vehicle .
okay , so &quot; a &quot; would have needed to be near
to keep the van on the road .
the overpass would have given &quot; a &quot; a clear view
and also cover from the deputies .
are there any traffic cameras in the area
that you can hack into ?
i am one step ahead of you .
backing up that footage now .
one frame of &quot; a , &quot; that &apos;s all we need .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s really you .
there has to be another way out .
there is not .
now come , sit down .
it &apos;s tea time .
tea time ?
what is this place ?
do you know where we are ?
we &apos;re in my living room , spencer .
this is my house .
why are you acting like such an imbecile ?
han , it &apos;s not like you &apos;re gonna gain it
all back by eating one cookie .
you know you want one .
we really thought you were dead .
thank god for mrs. grunwald .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;ll ever repay her
for saving my life that night .
i &apos;m so happy to see you guys .
we &apos;re really happy to see you too , mona .
do not call me that again .
you know how much i loathe that bitch .
it &apos;s her hair .
so , alison ...
more tea ?
we need to start the game .
what if we don &apos;t want to play ?
four chimes means it &apos;s game time .
the object of the game is to be ready for your date
by acquiring an outfit .
then you get to open the door
and find out who your mystery date is .
like this .
wait , that &apos;s from the ice ball .
no . i &apos;m not going to sit here and play this stupid game .
there &apos;s something for everyone today .
梦寐以求的一晚 强制性出席
these are invitations to prom .
i think we &apos;re playing the game to see
who our prom dates will be .
no , i &apos;m not .
you win . okay ?
you can have us as your precious dolls .
but if caleb shows up here ,
if you do anything to hurt him , i will kill you .
hanna ! no .
you are not alison .
you &apos;re mona , okay ?
and this is not your house .
you &apos;re not here alone anymore .
there are five of us ,
and one of him , her , it , bitch .
hanna &apos;s right .
let &apos;s find a way to get the hell out of here .
mona , let &apos;s go .
my name is alison . alison dilaurentis .
mona , let &apos;s go !
what is that ?
it &apos;s trying to warn you .
guys , i can &apos;t take it .
oh , my god .
mona ! hurry !
guys !
it won &apos;t stop until you &apos;re in your rooms !
it should be coming up .
you can &apos;t get to that overpass without passing a camera , right ?
what the ...
&quot; a &quot; found a way to override the camera .
&quot; a &apos;s &quot; mocking us with a damn cartoon .
are you okay ?
i &apos;ll go get you some ice for that .
i don &apos;t need ice . i need to find aria .
and we &apos;ve got nothing . nothing !
if i can find the right code ,
then maybe i can write a program
that &apos;ll pinpoint the source of the hacker &apos;s signal .
that &apos;s all we need to prove to tanner
that &quot; a &quot; took control of the van .
we &apos;ve got 3 minutes . come on !
every night the main generator shuts down like clockwork .
it takes exactly 3 minutes for the back @-@ up power to kick in .
i have run for 90 seconds in each direction .
that &apos;s the way out , but there &apos;s an old silo at the end ,
and you have to climb up .
there is a ladder ,
but it &apos;s about 50 feet to the top .
and you can &apos;t get there before the power turns on
and all the doors lock again .
that leads to a big , empty room .
there &apos;s nothing there . it &apos;s not a way out .
but if you go past it , there &apos;s a steel door
at the end of the hall and it &apos;s sealed like a vault .
like a bank vault ? what &apos;s inside ?
i &apos;m dying to know , too , spencer .
but i &apos;ve never made it inside .
it &apos;s too far to make it back to your room .
what happens if you don &apos;t make it back in time ?
it leaves you for days without food or water .
it blasts the siren until you &apos;d rather die
than listen to it one more second .
on a loop it plays a recording of the people
that you &apos;ve left behind , crying at your funeral .
is my mom okay ?
you know you &apos;re mona .
it wanted me to become alison .
so that &apos;s who i am when it &apos;s watching .
it thinks it beat me .
but i &apos;m still here .
i &apos;m the one who &apos;s winning the game .
is she okay ?
my mom ?
i saw her a lot in the beginning .
but there was a trial .
they convicted ali for your murder .
and they arrested us as accessories .
i didn &apos;t think you were wearing that
to make a fashion statement .
yep , she &apos;s mona .
your mom never showed up to the courthouse .
we heard that it was all too much for her .
god , mona , i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re okay .
did you hear that ?
hear what ?
we &apos;ve got 17 seconds . run !
is spencer ok ?
you can drop the whole caring friend act .
we know exactly who and what you are .
i &apos;ve done some bad things , mr. hastings ,
but like it or not ,
i am spencer &apos;s friend .
you forced our daughter to lie for you .
now she &apos;s in as much trouble as you are .
i was desperate .
and so are we .
do you know where she is ?
spencer ?
no .
don &apos;t you ?
alison , i promise you that guard outside
will not be able to save you if you lie to us tonight .
what happened ?
their van never made it to the penitentiary .
the police think that they escaped .
but we know that &apos;s not true .
i don &apos;t know where they are .
but i do know who took them .
we &apos;re listening .
it &apos;s &quot; a. &quot;
any chance of &quot; a &quot; hurting those girls again died with mona .
mona was &quot; a. &quot;
that &apos;s true .
but it all started again
when she was locked up in radley .
it was the same game , but with a new puppet master .
and the stakes were higher than ever .
this &quot; a &quot; killed my mom and mona .
oh , come on .
if you really believe that , then why didn &apos;t you go to the police ?
hanna tried , but there wasn &apos;t any proof .
there never is .
why would it start all over again ?
it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
mona was sick .
we know that that &apos;s why she wanted to hurt the girls .
i &apos;m telling you the truth .
i swear it .
why be honest now ?
i &apos;m going to spend the rest of my life in here .
i don &apos;t have anything else to lose .
but you do .
it has a name .
for me ?
would you like me to put it on ?
it &apos;s all there in black and white .
somebody cyber @-@ jacked the van and kidnapped the girls .
you put a lot of work into this theory .
it &apos;s not a theory , it &apos;s the facts .
yes , i know .
our analyst gave me
a very similar report this morning .
take a look .
dispatch .
put out an apb for caleb rivers .
yes , ma &apos;am .
what ?
you don &apos;t happen to know where he is ,
do you , officer cavanaugh ?
no . i--
i haven &apos;t seen him for days ,
but what does caleb have to do with this ?
these reports do prove that someone
cyber @-@ jacked that vehicle .
and i &apos;m betting that it is caleb rivers .
i think he knows where his girlfriend is .
you guys , the blocks in the playroom spelled out a name .
charles .
please find your stations .
&quot; aria montgomery , music committee . &quot;
&quot; emily fields and spencer hastings ,
decorating committee . &quot;
&quot; hanna marin , food and beverage . &quot;
bite me .
&quot; alison dilaurentis , prom queen election committee . &quot;
all these songs are from like 7 years ago .
a night at the opera .
that was the prom theme the last year that melissa took ian .
so &quot; a &apos;s &quot; recreating a prom we already had ?
well , if i &apos;m on the election committee ,
you can be sure i &apos;ll win that crown .
sort of like old times , huh , spencer ?
remember when i rigged the election for you
to win class president ?
want to fill some of these out ?
i &apos;ll help you if you help me .
sure .
if &quot; a &quot; doesn &apos;t mind ,
maybe we can all help each other ,
starting with these ballots .
we know about &quot; a. &quot;
you ok ?
so this is going to be our senior prom ?
we &apos;re decorating with construction paper and tape ?
maybe that &apos;s part of our punishment ,
to put together the lamest prom ever .
you know , this space is actually pretty awesome .
i &apos;m surprised &quot; a &quot; doesn &apos;t have the imagination to see it .
it &apos;s a big , ugly room .
okay , but what if ...
what if we use the staircase
to make a grand entrance for ali to walk down ?
we think gloria swanson in sunset boulevard .
all right , we could rig a bunch of cameras to go off
on a timer as you walk down those steps .
it &apos;d be so easy to take all these copper pipes
and use them for drapery rods .
and we could use old pipes and make beautiful candelabras .
and we could hang wire from the ceiling
and hang shapes to create some beautiful shadows and silhouettes .
that would be a night at the opera .
we need to tell the other girls &apos; parents what we know .
agreed , but we were hoping to have some more answers
before we do that .
i don &apos;t understand why you can &apos;t take
this information to the police .
everything we give tanner
she twists to fit her own theory .
then let &apos;s take our case to the media .
i can call angela king at the philadelphia press .
she owes me a favor .
mr. hastings , with what we know about &quot; a , &quot;
that is just not the right move .
what do you know about &quot; a ? &quot;
everything &apos;s in those boxes .
and about a dozen more in a storage unit up on the north highway .
how did we not see this happening again ?
forcing the girls to keep things from you
is what &quot; a &quot; does best .
all right . well , maybe if we look at all this together ...
we might find something that you guys missed .
but before you do that ...
&quot; a &quot; didn &apos;t just prey on the girls .
your secrets are in there , too .
and if you decide to open them ,
you need to be prepared for those to come out .
no more secrets .
the police are downstairs .
and they want to come up .
they &apos;re here for me .
and you &apos;re harboring a fugitive .
you can &apos;t be here when they find him .
don &apos;t stop looking .
caleb , wait--
toby ...
he &apos;s doing the right thing .
and we need you on the right side of this ,
and your boss .
it &apos;s melissa .
melissa ...
v _ 海斯汀 _ 移动电话987
there &apos;s something you need to know .
so &quot; a &apos;s &quot; a guy ?
i don &apos;t know any girls named charles .
why would &quot; a &quot; give you a gas mask ?
ali &apos;s his favorite .
i think after the prom ,
she &apos;s the only one he wants to keep .
so our night at the opera
is going to turn into a scene from carrie ?
no , we &apos;re not going to let that happen .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , spencer ,
but i promise you don &apos;t have time to make it to that vault .
so have you ever built one ?
i haven &apos;t needed to build one .
but i &apos;ve read about it .
build what ?
the stuff spencer said she needed to decorate .
if it delivers ,
we &apos;ll have what we need to build a machine
that temporarily shuts off the electricity .
how long is temporarily ?
long enough to get us out of here .
yeah , we can turn off the power , but what about &quot; a ? &quot;
and it &apos;s his prom .
there &apos;s no way he &apos;s not coming .
i hope you &apos;re right , emily .
because like hanna said ,
there &apos;s five of us and one of him .
good morning . guten tag . bom dia .
please find your stations .
this is not what i was expecting .
so now you &apos;re excited ?
you &apos;re actually going to help &quot; a &quot; decorate this place ?
we can use this to make a curtain for ali &apos;s grand entrance .
well , you &apos;re on your own .
em , we &apos;re all in this together .
what are you doing ?
taking a stand .
by sitting ?
this isn &apos;t my prom . i &apos;m not helping .
why are you being such a bitch ?
i &apos;m being a bitch ? take a look around .
why are you making this so easy for &quot; a &quot; ?
oh , my god , drapes ! thanks , &quot; a. &quot;
i &apos;m so excited , i get to have my senior prom in a dungeon .
you know what ? forget it , emily .
i don &apos;t need your help .
you did that on purpose .
get over yourself .
stop ,
this is already stressful enough as it is .
spencer , don &apos;t start--
i didn &apos;t start anything . the quitter did .
that &apos;s what you do , isn &apos;t it , emily ?
you quit things .
when things are too much for you ,
you just throw in the towel .
i mean , you quit the swim team .
you quit paige .
you even quit maya .
guys !
you , guys !
you guys !
stop it !
emily ! come on !
stop .
get her off !
stop . stop ! stop .
you guys , honestly , i cannot handle this .
please , can we not do this to each other ?
i &apos;m sorry , spence .
okay , i know this isn &apos;t your fault .
me , too .
look , i &apos;m just trying to make the best of a very bad situation .
if you baboons are done fighting ,
i could use some help over here .
then we can all decorate together .
if i knew where they were , i wouldn &apos;t be here right now .
i would be with hanna .
i would like to believe you . but i ...
but you don &apos;t and you won &apos;t . so let &apos;s quit wasting time .
you need to charge our client or release him .
you might not know exactly where they are ,
but you know more than what you &apos;re telling me .
you &apos;re right . i know a lot more than you do .
okay , son , i think it &apos;s time we go .
i hacked into your computer system ,
and i found the location where you lost the van .
you just admitted to a federal offense .
i think he meant to say if he hacked
into your system he could find the van .
and if he had further access to that system ,
he may be able to ...
override the hacker &apos;s jamming signal and locate the van .
those are some big &quot; ifs . &quot;
i think the bigger &quot; ifs &quot; are what if you &apos;re wrong ?
what if someone did take the girls ?
and because you haven &apos;t considered it ,
you and your analysts are looking in all the wrong places .
haven &apos;t you asked yourself how four teenagers
could be this good at evading the police ?
you &apos;re not going to find the answer
investigating the girls
because they &apos;re not running from you .
there &apos;s no way that hanna wouldn &apos;t call me if she could .
so is everything all set ?
yeah .
we &apos;re about as ready as we can be .
aria ,
since you &apos;re the photographer ,
you should take the pictures .
you know how to work that , right ?
yeah . it &apos;s just point and shoot , isn &apos;t it ?
yeah , just save it for tonight though ,
&apos;cause there &apos;s only one first picture .
you know what i mean ?
got it .
good afternoon .
guten tag . boa tarde .
please follow the lighted pathway
and return to your rooms .
we got this .
sometimes a hacker leaves a trail
intentionally coded to cover their tracks .
it &apos;s smoke and mirrors put there to distract you
while they &apos;re actually ...
did you find something ?
rivers ?
caleb ?
the thing about coming in through the back door
is the view is entirely different .
40.0508 north ,
75.4044 west .
those are coordinates .
that &apos;s where the van is .
are you sure about this ?
like i said , that &apos;s where the van is .
call it in , cavanaugh .
hold the sirens , but have aerial assistance standing by .
yes , ma &apos;am .
we got a possible location on the missing van .
&quot; a &quot; thought of everything .
clear !
fan out and search the perimeter .
and remember , this could be a hostage situation .
so abide protocol .
am i the only one who has goosebumps ?
no .
where is mona ?
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s here yet .
i guess that means we &apos;re supposed to dance .
ladies and gentlemen ,
please welcome your prom queen ...
alison dilaurentis !
charles !
we have something for you .
you should be standing up here , charles .
it &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t it ?
this is your prom , charles .
you should be crowned the king .
wait for it .
now !
let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s get the hell out of here . let &apos;s go .
hurry . let &apos;s go .
let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go . go , go !
this is the old campbell farm .
we used to bring the girls here to go apple picking .
lieutenant , over here .
what did you find ?
what is this place ?
it &apos;s &quot; a &apos;s &quot; lair .
hurry up !
hurry up , darling .
oh , my god .
if this is your vault ,
then these are the things you treasure the most .
you want to say good night to your sister
and give her a little kiss ?
what a good boy you are .
oh , good boys , good boys .
is that you , charles ?
spencer ?
this is not at all what i thought it would be .
&quot; a &quot; has a soul .
spencer !
spencer , where are you ?
hanna ! no !
you are not alison . you &apos;re mona .
and this is not your house , okay ?
you &apos;re not here alone anymore .
there are five of us
and one of him , her , it , bitch .
my god .
we &apos;ve searched the entire property .
there &apos;s no one here .
then where is this place ?
let &apos;s find a way to get the hell out of here .
mona , come on .
i &apos;m alison . alison dilaurentis .
for god &apos;s sakes , mona , let &apos;s go !
what is that ?
hurry .
oh , my god .
we &apos;re still trapped .
we can climb it . let &apos;s go .
stop !
