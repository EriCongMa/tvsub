it &apos;s , um ...
it &apos;s very beautiful .
so what &apos;s the occasion ?
the occasion is us .
we haven &apos;t really gotten out much
since storybrooke awakened ,
so i thought we should see it together .
thank you .
don &apos;t get your hopes up .
the nightlife is extremely limited .
no . that &apos;s not what i meant .
thank you for ... for what you &apos;re doing .
for how you &apos;re changing .
okay , &apos; stiltskin , i want my ax .
i &apos;m sorry , but we &apos;re closed .
it &apos;s mine . give it to me .
and yet , still closed .
just &apos; cause you possess something don &apos;t mean it &apos;s yours .
nothing in this shop belongs to you .
and you ?
how can you be with such a monster ?
or maybe you &apos;re just another possession , too .
how ...
dare you ? !
you want your ax ?
fine !
rumplestiltskin !
you can have it ...
buried in your chest !
stop !
stop ! this isn &apos;t you anymore !
oh , it &apos;s me , dearie .
always has been , always will be .
第四集
milah ?
bae ?
i &apos;m home .
bae .
papa ?
where &apos;s mom ?
well , she probably just ... lost track of time .
grab your cloak .
we &apos;ll find her .
ahoy , my three mates !
milah .
milah .
it &apos;s time to go .
good . so go .
who &apos;s this ?
ah , it &apos;s no one .
it &apos;s just my husband .
oh . well , he &apos;s a tad taller than you described .
please . you have responsibilities .
you mean like being a man and fighting in the ogre wars ?
other wives became honored widows
while i became lashed to the village coward .
i need a break .
run home , rumple .
it &apos;s what you &apos;re good at .
mama ?
bae .
you were supposed to wait outside , son .
you don &apos;t really
wish i &apos;d died ...
during the ogre wars , do you ?
i wish you &apos;d fought .
don &apos;t you ?
well , i- i &apos;m alive ,
and i &apos;m here with you ,
with bae .
this isn &apos;t a life ,
not for me .
why can &apos;t we just leave ?
w @-@ we &apos;ve talked about that .
you don &apos;t have to be the village coward .
we could start again ,
go somewhere no one knows us ,
see ... the whole world beyond this village .
i know this wasn &apos;t the life you wanted ,
but it-- it can be good ...
here .
at least try ,
if not for me , then ...
for bae .
okay .
i &apos;ll try .
what are you doing ?
i was , uh , gonna make you breakfast .
no . in-- in the basement .
i saw you practicing magic .
want some breakfast ?
no , we need to talk about this .
it was just a couple of spells . nothing to be concerned about .
okay , then be honest with me .
why did you bring magic here ?
i &apos;ve told you . magic is power .
why do you need it ?
tell me .
you don &apos;t need power , rumple . you need courage ...
to let me in .
rumplestiltskin , you need to get to the docks now .
the docks ? why ?
the men who came into port last week-- they &apos;ve taken milah .
they &apos;re setting sail . you must hurry .
on your feet for the captain .
i- i remember you , f @-@ from the bar .
it &apos;s always nice to make an impression .
where are my manners ?
we haven &apos;t been formally introduced .
killian jones .
now what are you doing aboard my ship ?
you have my wife .
i &apos;ve had many a man &apos;s wife .
no , you-- you see , we-- we have a son ,
and he needs his mother .
and see , i have a ship full of men who need ... companionship .
i @-@ i &apos;m begging you .
please let her go .
i &apos;m not much for bartering .
that said ,
i do consider myself an honorable man ,
a man with a code . so ...
if you truly want your wife back ...
all you have to do is take her .
never been in a duel before , i take it ?
well , it &apos;s quite simple , really .
the pointy end goes in the other guy .
go on .
pick it up .
a man unwilling to fight for what he wants ,
deserves what he gets .
please , sir .
what am i gonna tell my boy ?
try the truth .
his father &apos;s a coward .
keep swinging , dwarves .
did they find any fairy dust yet ?
no , not yet .
but they will , and when they do ,
we &apos;ll figure out a way to get mary margaret and my mom back .
i &apos;ll be back later with lunch .
i hate mine dust .
leroy ?
if you find anything , i &apos;ll be at the sheriff &apos;s station .
you taking over as sheriff ?
stepping in ...
until emma gets back .
belle ?
come on . at least come and eat something .
belle ?
i was wondering if you &apos;d heard from your daughter .
is this some kind of cruel joke ?
would i have made this flyer if i knew where she was ?
the only reason she &apos;s missing
is because of the deal i made with you ,
but i &apos;d held out hope she might have survived such a wicked trade .
and she has .
why hasn &apos;t she come looking for me ?
well , she did .
she even made the flyer like this one .
and let me guess .
you took care of it by throwing it in the trash .
i don &apos;t expect you to help me .
i just wanna know she &apos;s safe .
and now , thanks to you ,
neither one of us knows where she is .
you &apos;re a monster , rumplestiltskin .
it really is you .
the dark one , in the flesh .
or ... whatever that is .
you &apos;ve gone to a lot of trouble to meet me .
you better hope i agree it &apos;s worth my time .
i &apos;ve heard you &apos;ve been looking for something ,
and as luck would have it .
i &apos;m a man who trades in hard @-@ to @-@ find objects .
like a bean ,
a magic bean .
that can transport you between worlds .
i &apos;ve been told ,
they no longer exist in this land .
not in this land , no .
but the ships that dock here often return from far off lands
with treasures they don &apos;t always understand .
and yet you do .
it &apos;s my job ,
as is knowing the rumors
of who might pay the highest price for said treasures .
and what rumors could they be ?
that ... you were once a great coward
but that you became the dark one to overcome that .
and protect a @-@ a son who you lost despite all--
it &apos;s not nice to spread rumors .
a bean !
where ... is it ?
i don &apos;t have it .
but i hid it . i @-@ i swear .
you haven &apos;t heard my price .
i spin straw into gold .
price shouldn &apos;t be a problem .
oh , i don &apos;t want money . i want eternal life .
only the dark one has life eternal .
tell you what , my son .
what i can do-- what about youth ?
spin the clock back ...
till you &apos;re a little boy again .
close enough . deal .
but remember ...
you fail to deliver , i spin the clock forward
and turn you into dust .
thank you . thank you .
you sure you don &apos;t want anything ?
where &apos;s my scurvy crew ?
ah ! here we be , cap &apos;n !
where &apos;s my beer ?
you know , i suddenly find myself quite thirsty .
cheers .
thank you .
are you okay ?
that &apos;s your third iced tea this morning .
wouldn &apos;t wanna have to call you a cab .
no , i @-@ i &apos;ve never had it iced before .
it &apos;s--it &apos;s delicious .
i haven &apos;t seen you in here before .
well , i , uh ...
i &apos;ve been a kept woman until recently .
let me guess . bad breakup ?
i ... think i may be headed there .
and do you have a place to stay ? any family here ?
uh , i &apos;m--i &apos;m not sure . i &apos;m still looking .
but i &apos;m on my own for now .
i could ask granny about a room here .
really ?
thanks .
ruby .
belle .
what i really need , though , is--is a life , a job .
well , uh , what do you like to do ?
i do love books .
the library . it &apos;s been closed forever ,
but , uh , things are changing now .
maybe they need a librarian .
excuse me , miss .
you startled me .
i @-@ i was just wondering if you had any spare change .
oh , no , sorry . i @-@ i don &apos;t have any money .
what--what about a friend ? are you meeting anyone here ?
uh , no . why ?
i just wanted to make sure .
hey , you ! stop .
even gutter rats have more manners than you just displayed .
no , i &apos;m so sorry , sir .
i was wrong .
not a rat at all . more ...
more like a crocodile .
what &apos;s your name ... crocodile ?
you . i remember you .
always nice to make an impression .
where are my manners ?
we haven &apos;t been properly introduced .
rumplestiltskin ,
or as others know me ,
the dark one .
i see my reputation precedes me .
it does ?
good !
that &apos;s gonna save us time during the
question and answer portion of our game .
what is it you want to know ?
how &apos;s milah , of course ?
who ?
only too happy to , uh , dig out the memory ,
but ... it gets really messy .
she &apos;s dead .
died a long time ago .
what is it you want ?
we didn &apos;t get a chance to finish our duel .
ha ! not now .
tomorrow at dawn . i am not a cruel man .
get your affairs in order .
also , you can spend tonight knowing
it &apos;ll be your last .
maybe i am cruel .
and don &apos;t think about trying to escape ,
because i will find you ,
and i will gut your entire crew ...
like the fish .
may i have a word ?
sheriff .
uh , acting sheriff .
and i &apos;m already late on another busy day ,
cleaning up the mess you made .
my apologies . that was a moment of poor judgment on my part .
and it &apos;s not lost on me that i &apos;m now here to ask for your help .
well , then it shouldn &apos;t be lost on you when i say &quot; no . &quot;
hear me out first .
i &apos;m here to report a missing person .
she left my home early this morning .
her name is belle .
back in our land , you mentioned you loved someone once .
is--
yes .
you also said she died .
i thought she had .
well , why don &apos;t you just use the tracking spell
you gave me to find jefferson ?
it only works if you have something the person owned .
i @-@ i don &apos;t .
how can you be sure she &apos;s gone missing
and not ... run away ?
i can &apos;t .
look , the townsfolk are less than sympathetic to my plight ,
but you--
you &apos;re in the rather unique position
to understand exactly what i &apos;m going through .
won &apos;t you help me ?
pick it up , dearie ,
and let &apos;s begin .
there &apos;s no need .
sorry ,
but killing a man with his own sword
was just too delicious to pass up .
ships that pass in the night .
well , at least one ship .
go on . i &apos;m ready for the sword .
no .
do you know what it &apos;s like
to have your wife stolen from you ?
to feel powerless to stop it ?
it feels like having your heart ripped from your chest .
actually , let me show you .
stop !
milah .
who are you ? what-- what do you want from me ?
i &apos;m just a man who procures hard @-@ to @-@ find objects .
in this case , the object was you .
so then who-- who put you up to this ?
belle ?
oh . oh , how i &apos;ve missed you , belle .
father .
i &apos;m so sorry this is how we had to be reunited .
please understand .
i had no choice .
but kidnap me ?
after the curse broke ,
i searched all over for you
and discovered the dark one still had you captive .
he wasn &apos;t holding me captive .
i chose to be with him .
are you saying you fell in love with him ?
but i fear it may be over now .
it must be .
promise me you no longer love him ,
that you will never see him again .
i &apos;m not-- i &apos;m not a child .
you don &apos;t understand what that man will do to you ,
what he &apos;s already done .
no , you don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s my life .
then i don &apos;t have a choice .
i &apos;m sorry .
do it .
what ? father ?
father , what-- what are you doing ? stop !
good @-@ bye , belle . i love you .
father !
yeah , that &apos;s him , all right .
do you remember turning a butcher into a pig ?
can &apos;t say that i do . why ?
well , he does .
and apparently , it was his father .
i &apos;m beginning to understand why nobody wants to help you .
well , what-- h @-@ has he seen belle ?
afraid not .
okay , so what &apos;s next ?
granny &apos;s .
we can see who else you terrorized there .
look , uh ...
can i ask you a question ?
about you and mary margaret ?
h @-@ how are ...
how does that work ?
are you asking dating advice ?
of course not , no .
honesty .
that &apos;s how we did it .
hard work and being honest with one another .
well ... i don &apos;t lie .
there &apos;s a difference between literal truth and honesty of the heart .
nothing taught me that more than this curse .
milah . uhh !
how ?
milah , you have to run .
no . i &apos;m not leaving without you .
oh , how sweet .
it appears there &apos;s more to this tale than i know .
tell it to me , milah .
please don &apos;t hurt him . i can explain .
tick @-@ tock , dearie . tick @-@ tock .
that first night when killian and his crew came into the tavern ,
he told stories about the places he &apos;d been ,
and i fell in love with him .
i didn &apos;t mean for it to turn out this way .
i didn &apos;t know how to tell you the truth .
i &apos;m sorry .
and so here we are .
you &apos;ve come to save the life of your true love ,
the pirate .
i didn &apos;t realize the power of true love before .
it is impressive .
i &apos;d hate to break it up .
actually , no .
i &apos;d love to .
aah ! wait .
i have something you want .
well , i find that very difficult to believe .
where did you get that ?
you know who i took it from .
i may not know what the dark one wants , with a magic bean ,
but i have it .
oh , i feel a proposal coming on .
the magic bean in exchange for our lives .
deal ?
i wanna see it first .
belle , huh ?
sorry . doesn &apos;t ... ring a bell .
ruby , listen to me .
if you &apos;ve come across her , you gotta tell me .
i &apos;ll make sure nothing bad happens .
yeah , but what about him ?
i &apos;ve got him . trust me .
she was in earlier .
she was looking for a job .
i pointed her in the direction of the library .
when do you think she went there ?
don &apos;t know .
but ...
when you find her , give her this .
she left it in her booth .
no , that &apos;s mine .
she didn &apos;t have anything for the cold .
you sure you &apos;ll watch out for her ?
yes .
why ?
i think ...
i think i can find her .
lately , since things changed ,
i &apos;ve been , uh , a little more sensitive to odors .
what , you can smell her ?
i guess it &apos;s &apos; cause of the wolf thing .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i had her , but ... i lost her trail .
it must be the flowers .
i can &apos;t track her anymore . i &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t be . this is her father &apos;s shop .
you again .
out . this is a private establishment .
you &apos;re not welcome .
where &apos;s belle ?
i won &apos;t let anything happen to her , moe .
we &apos;re just worried .
don &apos;t be . she &apos;s safe .
so you can stop looking .
look , if i could just have the chance to talk to her .
you will destroy belle like you destroy everything else .
well , i won &apos;t let that happen .
what have you done with her ?
there &apos;s only one way to get her away from you .
what have you done ?
i have to make her forget about you ,
no matter the cost .
even if it means she forgets me , too .
he &apos;s sending her across the town line .
where are you sending belle across ?
you know we have patrols on the storybrooke line
to make sure no one crosses accidentally .
so how are you planning to pull it off ?
where ? ! where are you sending her across ?
tell me where !
stop it . you &apos;re gonna kill him .
you &apos;ve been down in the mines .
the tunnels . they lead out of town .
milah , what happened ?
fetch some water .
get the captain water !
and get me that prisoner from below deck
along with the booty he carried . now !
bring up the prisoner !
well , well , seems like you finally found the family
you could never have with me .
all right , get your sorry arse up there .
you asked to see it , and now you have .
do we have a deal ?
can we go our separate ways ?
do you mean ,
do i forgive you ?
can i move on ?
perhaps . perhaps .
i can see you are ... truly in love .
thank you .
just one question .
what do you want to know ?
how could you leave bae ?
do you know what it was like walking home that night ...
rumple--
knowing i had to tell our son ...
please .
his mother was dead ?
i was wrong to lie to you . i was the coward . i knew that .
you left him ! you abandoned him !
and there &apos;s not a day that goes by
that i don &apos;t feel sorry for that--
sorry isn &apos;t enough !
you let him go .
i let my misery cloud my judgment .
why were you so miserable ?
because i never loved you .
milah .
no !
i love you .
you may be more powerful now , demon ,
but you &apos;re no less a coward .
i &apos;ll have what i came for now .
you &apos;ll have to kill me first .
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not in the cards for you , sonny boy .
i want you alive .
because i want you to suffer like i did .
killing me is gonna take a lot more than that , dearie .
even demons can be killed .
i will find a way .
well , good luck living long enough .
please .
please , please stop . what are you doing ?
sending you on a little ride under the town line .
once you cross ,
you &apos;ll forget who you were in the other realm and who you loved .
this should help you find the key .
i left it at the bottom of the cart .
good luck .
william !
i &apos;m begging you ! please don &apos;t--don &apos;t do this !
please !
stop !
what &apos;s happening ? !
that is seriously ... wow .
belle , are you all right ?
i , uh , i think so .
do you remember who i am ?
i do . rumplestiltskin . i ...
i remember .
what &apos;s wrong ?
thank you for what you just did ,
but that doesn &apos;t change that you &apos;re too cowardly
to be honest with me .
but , belle , i--
i tried to tell him that , belle .
come with me , darling .
after what you just tried to do to me ?
you &apos;re no better , father .
you don &apos;t get to decide what i do or how i feel . i do .
if either of you cared about me , you would &apos;ve listened .
i don &apos;t wanna see either of you again .
ever .
this one is a classic .
the syrup goes on the pancakes--
the , um , round things .
but i kind of like when it gets on everything .
you know , uh , thank you .
and not just for this , but ...
for everything .
no worries . and stay here until you &apos;re on your feet .
granny will be fine with it .
oh , i almost forgot .
someone dropped this off for you at the front desk .
&quot; we may sit in our library ,
and yet be in all quarters of the earth . &quot;
you gave me the key ?
i heard of your interest , and i , uh ...
i made some inquiries .
there &apos;s an apartment for the caretaker .
if you want it .
if--if this is some way to win me back ,
after everything you--
that &apos;s--that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not why i &apos;m here .
i came because ...
you &apos;re right ...
about me .
i am a coward .
i have been my entire life .
i tried to make up for it by collecting power ,
and the power became so important
that i couldn &apos;t let go ...
not even ...
when that meant losing the most important person in my life .
your son .
baelfire is his name .
after he left ,
i dedicated myself to finding him .
i went down many , many paths
until i found a curse
that could take me to the land where he &apos;d escaped .
here .
and i found myself in this little town
with only one thing left to do .
wait for the curse to be broken
so that i could leave
and find him .
but instead of looking for him , you brought magic .
because i &apos;m still a coward .
magic has become a crutch
that i can &apos;t walk without .
and even if i could ,
i know now i can never leave this place .
because anyone who leaves forgets the people they love .
so when you go to look for baelfire ...
you won &apos;t know him .
magic comes with a price .
belle , i have to break this new curse .
that &apos;s why i was using magic
that night you saw me down in the basement .
i have lost so much that i loved .
i didn &apos;t wanna lose you again
without you knowing ...
everything .
good @-@ bye , belle .
do you , um ,
have you ever had a hamburger ?
yes , of course .
well , i haven &apos;t .
but i hear that granny &apos;s makes a great one .
maybe--maybe we could ...
try it sometime ?
i would like that .
no .
he tricked me !
allow him to speak .
i want my bean .
let me tell you how it works on my ship .
i make the demands . you follow them .
the bean &apos;s now mine .
you have to give me something for it .
oh , i will . your life .
the chance to join my crew .
so instead of the promise of eternal life ,
i get to scrub blood off your decks . how is that right ?
what if i was to tell you i was about to set sail
to a land where none of us will ever grow old ?
where i can discover how to get my revenge on rumplestiltskin ?
i &apos;d say i could live with that .
good . what &apos;s your name , sailor ?
william .
william smee .
can i have my hat ?
well , mr. smee ,
welcome aboard .
harden up and get ready to set sail , mates !
there &apos;s bumpy seas ahead .
what &apos;s the name of the place we &apos;re headed , cap &apos;n ?
neverland .
you &apos;re probably wondering
why i brought you here .
i found this
in the mines ...
mr. smee .
i am so sorry . i didn &apos;t have--
i &apos;m not interested in apologies .
i &apos;m interested in information
about the man you work for .
i &apos;ll tell you anything you wanna know about moe .
no . not about moe .
your captain .
where is he ?
i &apos;ve never seen him in storybrooke , i swear .
for some reason , when the curse hit ,
it--it didn &apos;t take him .
then where ... is ... he ?
hello , hook .
hello , cora .
you tell me it &apos;s something important you needed to show me .
sparkly dirt . wonderful .
just the remains of a magical wardrobe
that can travel between worlds .
is it enough to get us where we need to go ?
not quite , but it &apos;s a start .
we &apos;re almost ready to set sail .
what &apos;s our port of destination ?
storybrooke .
curious name . is that where--
she is .
and so is he .
excellent .
you &apos;ll be able to see your daughter .
