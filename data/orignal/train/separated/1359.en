What time is it?
A little after 5:00.
I forget how long the waiting takes.
Here, have some more coffee.
Thanks, mom.
What was that? My watch must have stopped.
Run! Run!
Keep moving!
When you get to the door, remember,
they moved everything last week.
Head right!
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Great news.
You're gonna get a dishwasher with only one button. Yay!
No. Okay.
Top and bottom rack, regular soil, air --
Don't air.
O-- but it has the little energy saver symbol next to it.
I know, but it takes like nine hours to finish,
and the sound of the fan drives me crazy.
Energy waster on.
It would take less time to wash them by hand.
Okay, what? What is your great news?
Uh, your mother's cousin Carlo called. He's in town.
How did he get your number?
I don't know.
He said he was in the neighborhood,
and he's gonna stop by tonight.
Here?!
Yes.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, uh...
Call him back and tell him that there's been another flood
at the dirty robber and Ma has to fix it.
No, because then he'll go there,
and it'll be on Korsak.
What?
Uh, call him back
and tell him that Ma has pancreatitis.
Okay, why do you want me to lie to cousin Carlo?
Because he got $50,000
from falling at a rudy tudy's when he was 23 years old,
and he's been chasing the dream ever since.
He slips, he falls, he sues.
And nobody is safe -- restaurants, families, museums.
Okay, well, I can't call him back
because he said that his phone broke
and he was calling from a pay phone.
Of course he was.
Okay, we're gonna have to tape down all the rugs.
Ma, did you give cousin Carlo Maura's number?
I would never.
Well, he's coming here tonight.
What?
I have to say, he's upped his game a little bit.
Okay, uh, I'm gonna get rubber mats
for all these slippery hardwood floors.
Okay, wait a minute.
Have either one of you ever actually seen him fall?
This is heavy.
Uh, no.
But his taste in Italian suits
is way too nice for a guy who doesn't have a job.
He doesn't have a job, and he has two lexuses.
Or two Lexi.
Okay.
But it's highly unlikely
that he would do this in front of his family.
There are like a million other people he could scam.
You don't know Carlo.
Rizzoli.
Isles.
Okay.
Ma, you got this?
Yes.
Okay.
Knives.
Noted.
In order to sue, there must be negligence.
And I am many things,
but negligent is not one of them.
Bigger purses than yours have thought the same.
All right, well, have you ever seen
broken feet on the chairs in my great room?
Or glass all over the floor
or a chandelier hanging from a thread?
No, because that's not who I am.
I agree.
Your house does not look like some weird horror movie,
but he will adapt.
And precautions need to be taken.
Okay, I'll keep my eye on things,
even though your mother
is preparing my home for a Rizzoli apocalypse.
Victim's Helen Barnes, 53.
500 people at this big sale.
Nobody saw anything.
Our victim's daughter said her mother
would go big-sale hunting all the time.
Wouldn't be the first experienced shopper
to be taken out by a crowd.
No, but that's not how she died.
There's a wound on her lumbar region.
She was stabbed.
Stabbed?
For a five-second advantage to get in the store?
What? Someone just had to get their hands on the last blender?
Well, they don't let you bring blenders into jail,
so that hardly seems worth it.
Maybe she was targeted.
All right, we're gonna need the store's security footage.
I'm on it.
Makes me want to give up going to malls.
You don't go to malls.
Mission accomplished.
Good lord.
It's worse than Kenmore Square when the sox won the series.
I can barely make anyone out.
There.
I didn't see anyone stab her.
Must have happened right before she entered this camera angle.
Let me back it up a little bit.
Hey, can you play it half speed?
Freeze it. Look at him.
That guy.
See how he looks over his shoulder?
He's not too interested in the store, is he?
I'll isolate him and run facial recognition.
Yeah.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
She was a wonderful woman.
Passionate about deals --
Finding them, getting them.
If she was so good at finding deals,
do you think any of her fellow shoppers
might have held a grudge against her?
No, it wasn't like that.
We'd see the same faces over and over.
Getting a doorbuster item was like a game.
There's no animosity in the community.
Have you ever seen this man?
No.
Is that who killed my mom?
I don't know.
Why would he do that?
Why would he kill my mother?
Korsak's still in with the victim's daughter.
Well, we just I.D.'d the guy from the Best Lots.
His name's Elliot Dutton.
Uniforms went to his house, but he wasn't there.
Anything from the background check?
No, nothing helpful.
He's a bookkeeper -- clean.
You know, maybe we're reading too much into this video.
We see a killer looking around for witnesses,
but maybe this is just a guy
going back to his car for his wallet.
Elliot Dutton just used his credit card
to buy a ticket on a bus leaving from Boston west.
Or not.
Thanks.
All passengers, please have your tickets readily available
to show the driver.
Thank you.
Elliot Dutton?
Stop! Police! Wait, wait! Hey, hey!
Thank god you're here. Oh, my god.
He's chasing me, please. Y-y-you have help me.
Okay, okay, calm down. Who is chasing you?
My boss. He wants to kill me.
He just yelled my name. Didn't you hear him?
That was me, Mr. Dutton.
You?
I just yelled your name.
You come at --
suit and tie, hair -- you called my name, right.
You called my name.
All right.
Uh, he called your name, yeah.
Why don't you just, uh, come with us? Come on.
Why did you take my clothes? I didn't do anything?
Then why did you run?
Like I said, I thought my boss was chasing me.
This woman was stabbed outside of the Best Lots today.
We have video of you running from her body.
What? I didn't kill anyone.
I-I-I-I wa-- my boss, he attacked me at our office,
and I was running away to avoid being killed.
So, you knew that large crowd was gonna be there.
Yeah, Best Lots is near where I work.
I arrive early on sale days to avoid traffic.
I wouldn't hurt anyone.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to figure out if I know her.
I have, uh, trouble recognizing people's faces.
It's called facial recognition blindness.
Really?
Yeah.
If you were to walk away,
I wouldn't recognize you when you came back.
Must make it hard to differentiate
between good people and bad people.
It does.
Does that make you nervous?
All the time.
You know, if I was in your situation, I might carry a knife, too.
I don't carry a knife.
I didn't stab anyone.
I'll be right back.
Where's she going?
It's a real thing -- prosopagnosia.
I'm sorry, it's not a real thing.
Fear of spiders -- that's a real thing.
Hot dogs -- those are real things.
Hot dogs are barely a real thing.
Maura.
So, what happens is the part of the brain
that distinguishes facial features doesn't work.
People like you and me,
we take a mental picture of someone,
and we store it in our minds.
Prosopagnosics, they take a picture,
And then they throw it away.
They don't even recognize their parents.
It feels like a silver lining there.
But his mother probably is nothing like my mother.
In order to cope, people with this condition
find other ways to tell people apart.
Their build, hair, their voice.
2% of the population actually has it in some capacity.
Okay, fine, it's a real thing.
But he's probably lying about having it.
Did you find any blood evidence on his clothes?
Uh, no, they are still being processed.
Oh, you know, there are prosopagnosia research centers
at Dartmouth, Harvard, and University College London.
Gosh, I would love to escort him to London
to have him checked out,
but I feel that might stall our investigation.
Give me your lab coat.
No.
Why are you looking at my lab coat?
That's you, correct?
That's the jacket I was wearing.
Do you understand why we're concerned
since you're standing right next to a woman who was just stabbed.
Yes.
And if any of her blood is on your clothes,
It might be enough to put you away.
Now are you sure you don't want to tell me something else?
I didn't kill her.
I-I was running for my life.
From the boss who was attacking you for no reason.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Oh, this is Dr. Kepley.
She'll be consulting on this case.
We'd like you to take a look at some pictures.
We're hoping that
you recognize one of these men from the crime scene.
I don't -- I -- - Take your time.
I don't recognize any of them.
Are you sure.
I'm sorry.
Seriously?
It's pictures of the same two guys.
One of them is sitting right in front of you.
Detective Rizzoli?
There was no blood on Elliot's clothes or hands,
which there should have been given his proximity.
So he didn't stab Helen.
Facial recognition blindness -- now I've heard everything.
Happy to learn about it, glad I don't have it.
Admit it -- you'd miss my face.
If we believe him, Elliot was the target.
Helen was just collateral damage,
which makes him a material witness.
Worst witness ever.
I guess it's like dealing with a masked attacker.
What do we know about this boss who was chasing him?
Franklin Simms.
Owns a chain of dry cleaners --
17 locations throughout the city,
No history of violence, no criminal record.
Nina couldn't find him in any of the footage of the stampede.
But it's a stampede.
Helen was stabbed
in her lower back near the L1 vertebra.
That's an unusual place to be stabbed.
Unless you're chasing someone through a crowd,
trying desperately to kill them before they get away.
Don't you hate it when that happens?
Guess we ought to go find him.
Okay.
You know, even if I had prosopagnosia,
I'd still be able to recognize you.
Nobody in the department has a mane like that.
Oh, thank you.
No, that person I do not know.
Don't tell anybody I did that, all right?
I don't even want to remember it.
Korsak.
Found him.
Five wounds, all concentrated to his torso.
Is it the same knife that killed Helen?
Well, it appears that the apex of the incised wounds
is indeed rough and uneven,
which would be consistent with what Helen suffered.
"Indeed" is close to "Yes," right?
Yes, adjacent.
Okay, so, from this point of view,
you can't see the body.
So, Elliot comes in,
he sees a guy in a suit and thinks that it's Simms?
Well, if the killer had brown hair and wore a suit,
in the frenzy of an attack, it would be an easy mistake
for somebody with prosopagnosia to make.
Elliot came in early because of the sale.
Killer didn't expect him.
So Simms was the killer's target.
And Elliot was his hapless, not really an eye-witness.
That BRIC setup is impressive.
Yeah, we've made a lot of improvements this year.
I haven't seen you around.
Detective...?
Fordham.
I just transferred here. I'm on the second floor.
Uh, welcome.
I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.
Thanks.
I'll try and carve out some time.
Yeah, any time.
You can always find me right over --
Uh...excuse me.
I got to get this.
Hi, ma.
Hey, Frankie?
Hey, I really need your help.
Cousin Carlo is coming over to Maura's.
What? Why?
Yeah, I know. It's terrible.
He said he wants to see me.
Did you try to cancel?
Yes, but he's incommunicado.
All right, are you getting the house ready?
Of course.
But I needed more floor mats,
and there's an accident on 90.
Listen, Frankie, I need you
to get to the house in case I'm late.
We can't leave Maura there alone with him.
No, I'm really busy today, mom. I can't leave.
Oh, come on. That's what Janie said, damn it.
I need a Rizzoli there at all times in that house.
Whoa! Wh--
What just happened?
Maura's new car just saved my life.
Well, not my life, but still -- listen, Frankie.
Damn it, I need somebody to be at the house.
Ma, ma, I got to go, okay?
Good luck. I love you.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't I kind of stand out among all these old people?
BPD has an apartment at Lavintman's for years.
We've never had a problem.
The guy who's looking for you
is gonna look in a lot of different places
before he looks in an assisted-living facility.
We have department approval to keep you here for 48 hours.
You'll be guarded by a rotation of officers.
This is -- uh, sir?
Sorry. Officer Mekler.
Officer Mekler will be here to 8:00 p.m.
He'll be replaced by someone new.
Um, officer, could you keep your hat on?
That'll help Mr. Dutton recognize you.
No problem.
Thank you.
You're only gonna protect me for 48 hours?
Well, two days is a long time in an investigation.
I don't why Mr. Simms attacked me.
But if you can't find him,
what's to keep him from trying again?
Mr. Simms didn't attack you.
What?
Elliot, mr. Simms is dead.
He was killed this morning before you went into the office.
H-he didn't try to kill me?
No.
Of course.
Why would he try to kill me?
I can't believe I thought he was chasing me.
Why don't you tell us everything
you can remember about this morning?
I just -- can I have a minute?
Yeah, sure.
I've always loved jazz, you know?
I live down the street from Chick Corea in Chelsea.
He played my 16th birthday party.
Really? Oh, that must have been very special.
There you go, Maura.
Thank you, Carlo.
So, Angela is stuck in traffic.
She should be here any moment.
All those mats in the kitchen -- you must do a lot of cooking.
Uh, well, uh, even for wood floors,
French oak is so unforgiving.
So, what do you do for a living?
Music.
Oh, you play?
Trumpet, but I mostly teach.
I love the trumpet.
Such a heraldic instrument.
Yeah, I'd like to play more,
but had to give up the dream in order to survive.
Oh, god, I'm so sorry I'm late.
Angela, sweetheart!
You look fantastic.
Come here. Come here.
Nice to see you, Carlo.
Yeah, yeah, you too, honey.
I will leave the two of you to catch up.
Before we sit down, I need to use the restroom.
It's broken.
The downstairs?
Well, there's another one just up the stairs.
Not the stairs.
Angela.
Maura.
You're right, you're right.
Frankie did fix the bathroom downstairs.
It's right through there.
Thank you.
Socks. You let him wear socks?
Do you want to be homeless?
Hey, Angela? We are having a lovely time.
He has no reason to have an accident.
He does work, you know.
The trumpet?
Yeah, he blows a lot of hot air.
No, he teaches now.
Yeah, I don't know about that.
Angela, when is the last time you saw cousin Carlo?
A couple of christmases ago.
Exactly.
So, maybe he's outgrown his problem.
The tile work in here is lovely.
Oh, the night is young.
Hey, Jane.
How did you know it was me?
One leg is longer than the other.
Longer.
One heel hits harder.
Okay.
We need to talk about the case.
You want me to help you find a man I can't recognize
who's trying to kill me for a reason I don't know.
Elliot, you have to remember something
and you never know what could help.
But when I'm stressed out,
the techniques I use to get through the day,
they don't work very well.
You mean like remembering hair or jewelry
or weird leg length?
Right.
My mother --
She, uh, wore the same kind of clothes.
She never changed her hair.
But still, sometimes when I saw her out in the neighborhood,
I wouldn't even know who she was.
Is this condition the reason
that you've lived in the same place for 15 years?
Uh, I change as little as I can --
same apartment, same to work,
same stores.
Same people know you.
At least the people that think I'm stupid or rude --
It's the same group of people.
I, um...
I dream of going to other places.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Where do you dream of going?
Don't laugh.
I will not.
Norway.
Really?
I want to see fjords.
What's gonna happen when my 48 hours are up?
Well, why don't we address that when we get to it?
That woman is dead
because I couldn't tell the difference
between a killer and a man I'd worked with for six years.
Elliot, you have a medical condition.
You couldn't help it.
I just don't want anyone else to get hurt.
Okay, well, let's agree on nobody else gets hurt.
That includes you.
That is nice of you to say.
But the truth is, if anything happened to me,
no one would even notice.
What do you got?
Elliot may have facial recognition problems,
but he also may have bullshit recognition problems.
There's a piece missing from his books. Look.
25% of the company's annual income
is paid to "Dividends."
This year, that amounted to $750,000.
Pretty nice little payout. What's the problem?
It's all paid in cash,
and there are no corresponding
accounts indicating where it's going.
Nothing?
Just says "Dividends."
We didn't find any tax records in his office, did we?
No.
And it'll take the I.R.S. a year to comply with a subpoena.
Well, let's get Jane to ask Elliot what he knows about it.
Hey, Jane.
I was trying to walk really evenly.
Even without the walk, there's the hair.
Nothing gets past you, huh?
How was your night?
Old people snore.
Yeah.
Elliot, we need to talk about Villa's finances.
Is there a problem?
The dividend payout --
three quarters of a million dollars last year.
You have any idea where that was going?
No.
Elliot, I can't help you if you don't tell me the truth.
I was just the bookkeeper.
I didn't do corporate filings or taxes.
But that doesn't mean you didn't know something was going on.
The cleaners had a really high number of cash transactions.
I thought there should have been more credit cards.
Did you ever say anything about it?
It's hard to keep your job when you can't recognize your bosses.
I decided I would not ask any questions
so Simms would look the other way on my thing.
Did you ever notice anything
out of the ordinary in any of the shops?
No, but I've only been to the one near my house.
They never asked you to pick up any receipts or deposits
at any of the other locations?
Simms did that himself.
I always thought he was just being nice
because he knew I was uncomfortable being out in the world.
That wasn't it, was it?
I don't know yet.
I'll come check on you later, okay?
Okay.
All right, hang in there.
Jane's right -- there's more to Mr. Simms' reluctance
to let Elliot see the cleaners than just kindness.
Four years ago, Villa cleaners began expanding
and acquired these six properties.
They added four locations a year after that.
I pulled these pictures from an online mapping program.
Are you sure the addresses are right?
I drove by that one myself just to make sure.
There's no way they were pulling in
that much revenue from just six legitimate locations.
They must be laundering money.
That's why most of the transactions are in cash.
This location had a fire yesterday...
Just a few hours after Helen was murdered.
Well, that's a little coincidental.
Killer's a step ahead of us.
Detective Kain?
Yeah.
Vince Korsak. We spoke on the phone.
This is Detective Rizzoli.
Nice to meet you both.
You said this property was linked to a homicide investigation?
Yeah, you mind if we take a look?
No, come on in.
We already finished our investigation.
It was definitely arson.
Dog sniffed accelerant right away.
Seems like some kind of makeshift office here.
Receipts in the garbage indicate
they've been here a few months at least.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hard drive's been drilled -- useless.
They're hiding something.
Amateurs.
What do you got?
They didn't stir the embers.
We may still be able to figure out what they were up to.
What are you doing?
How did you know it was me?
You were clomping.
You recognized my clomping?
No, I heard clomping, I looked up,
and I saw my best friend being weird.
Did you know that I have one leg that's longer than the other?
Really?
That's what Elliot
the propis-fuh-fuh told me after hearing me walk.
He has a very strong ear.
It is common with that condition.
You should get that looked at.
I don't want to get it looked at.
Well, it could cause damage to you back over time.
Simple enough to lengthen the other leg.
I don't need to be taller, maura.
Men are already afraid of me enough as it is.
And you think it's because you're tall?
That was a good one.
I heard it went well with Cousin Carlo last night.
It did.
Good, I'm glad.
Although, I didn't expect anything less.
All right.
Well, I'll see you later.
You didn't have to give me gelato.
Well, after what I did to your house,
I felt you deserved it.
Well, I'm not gonna say no to pistachio.
Who's that?
Did you order in?
No.
Janie, thanks for running over.
But I think Maura was right.
He's changed.
You don't think this is some kind of play?
No.
Janie! Hey.
Hey, Carlo.
Janie, it's so good to see you.
I'm so glad you stopped by.
How have you been?
Busy.
Oh, well, busy looks good on you.
Yeah, thank you.
Zeppole's ready.
Wh-- you made zeppoles?
I didn't know if I was gonna see you,
So I wanted to make something that could travel.
And I know you love my zeppole.
Can I have 10?
Coming right up.
He must be medicated.
Well, it's probably better for all of us.
Um...are we okay
that he's working with boiling oil?
Come on, he's fine.
And if he was what you say he was,
then he certainly doesn't fit that description anymore.
And I did take some precautions.
Godere questo bellisimo desserto de zeppole.
Ooh. Ooh, they look great.
Thank you, Carlo.
Of course.
You know what?
I think we could use a little more powdered sugar.
I told you so.
Don't you "I told you so" me!
Oh, I will "I told you so" you as long as I'm right.
What? That doesn't even make sense.
Okay, what are you, 12?
Hm, looks like we spilled a little -- whoa!
Oil.
Has he called yet?
Nope.
He'll call.
We will deal with it if he does.
What do we got here?
Using this ultraviolet, infrared dslr camera,
we take pictures of the burnt paper.
The computer analyzes the image,
and we can, up to 70% of the time,
bring up whatever is underneath the burn.
Some fancy camera.
Anything interesting yet?
Primarily receipts and pay stubs.
I'm not sure what this fire was supposed to be covering up.
Well, we think they were laundering money.
Creating receipts helps the income look legitimate.
Maura, this says "I.R.S."
Right here, Maura, can you process this one right now?
Sure.
"Audit requires all records for Villa cleaners
and its shareholders, including Koko Inc."
That's some magic camera you got there.
Thanks, Maura.
So?
Koko Inc. Is a shell corporation
that is wholly owned by Mary Ann Wilkhousen.
She's a lawyer.
Everything about her and her corporation is legitimate.
Mary Ann Wilkhousen?
When I was in the organized crime unit,
she worked as an attorney for Spencer Romero.
I think they had more than just a working relationship.
Wait, Spencer Romero?
The Spencer Romero?
Who's that?
Oh, he's a thuggish drug dealer from the east side.
BPD suspects him in at least 10 murders,
but he does the jobs himself.
There's never anyone to flip to convict him.
I'll bet he's the source of the cash Villa's been laundering.
Simms must have panicked when he got the notice from the I.R.S.
He told Romero
and Romero killed him to get rid of loose ends.
Okay, but how do we pin on him
with our witness who isn't really a witness?
We think that this man is associated with Mr. Simms.
Does he look familiar in any way?
Not really. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Uh, let's -- let's just watch this.
So, we're just looking to take a few kilos off your hands.
For how much?
We're good with the usual rate.
Get out of here. You think I'm an idiot?
Anything about his mannerisms?
Nothing.
I don't recognize him. I want to help.
Okay, Elliot.
Just -- you do this every day, okay?
You recognize people by characteristics that other people don't see.
You lived your whole life this way, so just...
Calm down.
I've got all day.
Okay, uh, play it again.
Okay.
So, we're just looking to take a few kilos off your hands.
For how much?
We're good with the usual rate.
That last bit -- play it again.
Okay.
We're good with the usual rate.
That clicking.
That's Mr. Wilkhousen.
Wilkhousen.
Yeah, he came around a bit.
He always smelled like he came straight from a hookah bar.
Okay.
Okay, Elliot, that's great. That's all I needed.
Is Mr. Wilkhousen selling drugs?
Because I never saw anything like that at the office.
I'm sorry, Elliot,
I-I-I can't really say anything about the case.
Who is he?
I have a right to know what I'm dealing with here.
Okay.
His real name is Spencer Romero.
But Elliot, that's -- that's really all
that I can tell you, okay?
And -- and I just --
I don't want you to worry about anything, all right?
You're very safe here.
I thought I have to leave after 48 hours.
I'm working on that, too.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
Romero was in their office. Elliot I.D.'ed him.
Visiting the office isn't a crime.
But as a witness for Simms' murder,
defense attorney would have field day with his facial blindness.
What if we got Romero on tax evasion and money laundering?
I mean, we've got the burnt receipts,
we've got Elliot's books.
That might work.
With Elliot's extensive knowledge of Villa's accounting,
could be enough to bring Romero down.
I mean, the charges aren't sexy,
but they worked on Capone.
Would this be enough to get Elliot
more permanent protection while we work on Romero?
I'll call upstairs.
Half a witness against Romero is better than none.
Right, I'll go tell him
we might be able to buy him some more time.
He's in the can.
Thanks for the report.
Ew, it really does smell like old people in here.
Yeah, you get used to it.
How long has he been in there?
I don't know. A while.
Elliot?
Elliot, it's Jane. You all right?
Shit.
He's gone.
What?
What happened?
Uh, nothing. - No, not nothing -- something.
Uh, used my phone to check the score of the game.
He said he had to use the bathroom.
Give me your phone.
Shit!
He hasn't used his credit cards
or taken cash out of an ATM.
Should have confiscated his wallet.
Frankie said Elliot's not at his house,
but it looks like he was there recently.
Well, he's spooked,
so he'll try and get as far away as he can.
If we can just find him,
BPD is willing to keep him in a safe house
until we nail Romero.
He probably knows we can keep him from
boarding a plane, right?
Yeah, and he doesn't own a car. It leaves trains and buses.
He still has that unused bus ticket.
I'll check out the buses.
I'll check inside.
All southbound passengers,
please proceed to Line 2 at Gate 1.
Elliot.
It's Jane.
We got to get you out of here.
No. I've got to get out of Boston.
I can keep you safe.
He could be anywhere.
Listen to me, okay? You're not alone.
The department can put you some place safe
while we deal with Romero.
Okay, you don't have to run away.
What if you can't deal with him?
I can deal with him.
Hey, Korsak, I got Elliot with me.
Uh, we're outside. Just meet us at the car, okay?
That hookah bar smell.
What? Here?
Spencer Romero! Police!
You good?
Ask Detective Dutton.
Detective?
I didn't think screaming, "Hey, stop,
I'm the guy who can't really recognize you."
would be much help.
Janie.
What are you doing here?
Well, Maura had said that you called,
so I came to say goodbye.
Wonderful.
May I?
Please.
Food good here?
Oh, cut the crap, Carlo.
Look, you may have gotten away
with suing the funeral parlor at Aunt Josie's funeral
and mysteriously cutting your fingertip off
with a ladder at Kay's hardware,
but you and I both know your neck is fine.
All right?
Really? With the cervical collar?
Come on!
Jane.
We're family.
Maura is family.
And when her father started causing problems, I shot him.
I understand that you have doubts, Jane,
But my neck does hurt.
And Maura has insurance.
She'll be fine.
You're an embarrassment to this family. You n --
Jane. I didn't expect to see you.
Yeah, I was just having a little chat with Carlo.
Okay, Carlo.
After you called, I wanted to meet with you
and give you a chance to do the right thing.
What can I say? I hurt my neck.
Okay.
See you at Christmas.
Don't threaten me.
Ehh, nice job with the hidden camera.
Well, I am trusting, but I'm not stupid.
Well, why didn't you tell me you put one up?
Because I wanted to be right about him.
It's not easy to admit that I'm right.
Sometimes.
All the time.
Okay, a lot.
You know, slip-and-fall scam artists
typically work in teams.
He was very talented.
Can't even believe you're giving him props.
I'm just saying artists come in all forms.
Are you are eating purse zeppole?
He does do one thing right.
Give me one.
These are really just Italian doughnut holes.
How dare you?
I'm not saying they're bad.
Not bad?
You don't deserve them. Give them to me.
No, no way. I saved them.
Give them to me.
You are staring at me like that again.
I dare you to blink.
Blink.
Blink.
If you squint really hard like this, you don't blink.
Blink.
Oh, God.
So easy.
Don't eat all of them, please.
I'm going to eat all of them.
