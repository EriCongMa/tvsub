第六季 第十七集
madam state &apos;s attorney .
thank you , david .
well done , alicia , truly .
julius , you &apos;re back .
we &apos;re closing the new york offices .
wow , thank you , everyone .
i &apos;m honored , i am .
thank you .
her office is mine .
already called dibs .
thank you .
thank you so much .
this is insane .
wow , look at all this stuff .
i want the muffins .
and whatever this is .
well , thank you , police union .
what are you doing ?
i &apos;m not working today .
i &apos;m gonna have a celebratory glass .
you can &apos;t-- you &apos;re only allowed to consume gifts
under $ 75 according to cook county ethics rules .
you &apos;re kidding .
no .
i &apos;ve been reading up on them .
here , have a muffin .
well , what do i do with this-- it &apos;s open .
breakage .
mr. castro .
alicia .
congratulations .
thank you .
ah , yes .
the honeymoon period .
oh , this is , uh , marissa , she &apos;s my ...
executive assistant .
... my executive assistant .
may i , uh , sit ?
oh , yes , please .
um , uh ... here .
do you mind if we speak alone ?
oh , um , marissa is helping me through the transition .
i trust her implicitly .
muffin ?
no , thank you .
alicia , we &apos;ve had our differences ,
but i want to bury the hatchet .
i want this passing of the baton to be smooth .
likewise .
uh , one way to assure that success is
continuity in the office ,
which is why i strongly urge you
to keep phil lorie as chief deputy .
he &apos;s , uh , he &apos;s a good strategist ,
not to mention loyal .
i &apos;m sure he is .
but i am going in another direction .
so thank you , but no .
uh , one more thing .
i &apos;m sure i don &apos;t need to mention this ,
but it is customary for the incoming sa not to investigate ...
cary , hang on , can you take a look at this ?
... the outgoing sa especially given our , uh , past encounters .
you mean the prosecution of my partner ?
yes , given that ,
i thought i would remind you of that rule .
that unwritten rule .
when i became sa ,
i was encouraged to look forward ,
not back , and there were a lot of things
to look back at with your husband .
if there was a gross mishandling of cases , james ,
they shouldn &apos;t be swept under the rug , should they ?
you come after me ,
i will ...
you &apos;ll what , james ?
you &apos;re a lame duck .
well ...
a lame duck can still tank your record
before you get started .
i can overload you with loser cases
so your stats will be screwed
when you drop them .
is there a problem ?
your friend , alicia florrick ,
she &apos;s playing on a field where she thinks she knows the rules .
she doesn &apos;t .
for the record , you have my permission to hold a grudge .
congratulations , ms. state &apos;s attorney .
thank you , cary .
it &apos;s like , uh , king tut &apos;s tomb in here .
yeah .
if king tut didn &apos;t have to obey the ethic rules .
sorry .
kalinda , good morning .
congratulations .
thank you , are you on your way in ?
we are swimming in wine and champagne here .
cheap champagne .
sounds good .
listen , lemond bishop asked me to call .
uh , i think he wants to talk .
okay , good .
tell him to come on in .
come on in ?
uh , are you sure ?
look , he &apos;s fine on the phone .
no , no , i think it &apos;s better in the open .
okay , look , i think he wants to talk about ...
what you could do for him .
yeah , okay , tell him to come on in .
i &apos;m fine , thank you , kalinda .
alicia , did you knock over a cheese and wine store ?
what &apos;s the point in having power
if you can &apos;t use it ?
time to negotiate ?
yeah , let &apos;s go see what they &apos;re offering .
well , with david lee involved ,
i think i know .
$ 350,000 .
really , david ?
yes , if you agree to these terms ,
we can cut a check today .
alicia &apos;s capital contribution alone
is worth half a million .
yes , and as alicia is well aware ,
we have had to pay
for significant capital improvements
upon assuming these offices ,
all of which falls on the partners .
we want this to be a dignified exit .
we all do .
and yet here we are ,
$ 300,000 short of dignified .
we &apos;re all family here ,
but our cash reserves have been depleted .
surely alicia knows that
we were bruised by the loss of chumhum .
yes , and because of the loss of chumhum ,
client retention is even more critical .
which is why i am assuring all my clients
that they &apos;re in good hands .
we have a deposition now .
why don &apos;t we all think about it
and get back together later in the day ?
just so long as we know
that alicia needs $ 300,000 more to be happy .
okay .
we have her over a barrel .
now that she &apos;s an sa ,
she has to divest her financial interests immediately .
so we stick with the lowball .
no-- if we piss her off ,
we put all our future criminal cases at risk .
no , alicia &apos;s no castro .
she wouldn &apos;t let this hurt our clients .
come on , she deserves the money--
she built this firm .
and abandoned it .
uh , then we bump it up another hundred thousand .
i can agree to that .
god , great negotiating stance , julius .
did you learn that in new york ?
we have a deposition .
shh ... let &apos;s not fight .
wharfmaster began as a labor of love .
sharing software in development has always been difficult
because of the size of the files .
that &apos;s why peer @-@ to @-@ peer sites were created .
so the average user of wharfmaster
is an entrepreneurial programmer
looking to share his latest creation ?
i , uh , have a novel idea .
how about we tone down the
snark and keep this civil ?
i don &apos;t know about average ,
but , yes , programmers are our biggest client base .
and yet 80 % of wharfmaster &apos;s traffic
comes from copyrighted music and films .
uh , nice parsing of numbers , mr. agos .
that 80 % reflects the number of downloads , not traffic .
and yet our client &apos;s movie was downloaded four million times
on your site before it opened in theaters .
4.2 million .
4.2 million times .
so when it finally premiered , the box office was depressed .
i &apos;m sorry , mr. dalton ,
but i saw in brain when it opened ,
and the box office was depressed
because the movie wasn &apos;t very good .
well , thanks for the review , jackass . listen ,
why don &apos;t you stop encouraging people to illegally download ?
and then maybe you wouldn &apos;t find yourself
in this situation .
gentlemen , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry that there are illegal downloads .
i really am , but i &apos;m like the post office .
people pick up and drop off letters and parcels .
i can &apos;t control if some of that activity is illegal .
because i &apos;m not looking inside of the parcels .
so , mr. bacevich , you and your employees have
no specific knowledge of any illegal downloading ?
is that correct ?
that &apos;s correct .
good . one second .
we &apos;re in trouble now .
what is this ?
i &apos;m on hold with the wharfmaster help line .
is this really necessary ?
welcome to wharfmaster .
my name is rami , how can i help you ?
hi , rami .
i &apos;m having some trouble downloading a file .
okay , what kind of file ?
it &apos;s the movie american sniper .
oh , come on ...
okay , how big is the file ?
it &apos;s about 700 megabytes .
are you using a vpn connection when you connect to wharfmaster ?
there it goes , it started to download .
thank you so much for your help .
no problem , have a nice day .
your client claimed that neither he nor anyone at wharfmaster
has specific knowledge of illegal downloading .
and yet here is his help desk
being helpful illegally downloading a movie .
so shall we discuss a number ?
mrs. state &apos;s attorney ...
mr. redmayne .
look at how she basks in her power , crystal .
huh ? i know that look .
now get over here .
get over here , come on .
okay .
oh , yes .
yes , yes , yes .
yes ...
this is my assistant ,
this is a great ...
my personal assistant , marissa .
executive assistant .
yeah , all right , well , look at all this crap .
what did we send over , crystal ?
a chess board .
uh , made out of human teeth .
well , anyway , can i sit over there ?
oh , please .
thank you .
is it really made out of human teeth ?
so i thought i &apos;d get together with you
to talk before the crowds descended on you ,
you know what i mean ?
everybody with their hands outstretched .
&quot; me , me , me , me ! &quot;
we &apos;re fine here .
why don &apos;t you , uh , sit here next to me ?
um , no , i &apos;m fine .
oh , i know you are ,
but i @-@ i want you to sit near me .
please .
pretty please .
ah , good . good , good , good .
now , i started out in sales , shoe sales .
did i ever tell you that , crystal ?
and there you have to look into the customer &apos;s eyes .
and @-@ and that &apos;s the way you know whether you &apos;ve made a sale or not .
is there something you want to sell me , mr. redmayne ?
i love women &apos;s feet .
you can always tell a woman &apos;s taste from her feet .
there &apos;s this whore in arizona ,
what was her name , crystal ?
she had the most elegant little feet .
would you like a muffin ?
brittney .
yeah , cute little piece of ass .
and she could do the most amazing things with her feet .
and your feet are like hers .
is there something you need , uh , mr. redmayne ?
well , yeah , i want you to appoint dean lumber as your major deputy .
why ?
i &apos;ve known him 20 years .
he &apos;s a hell of a guy , he &apos;s a hell of a lawyer .
he &apos;d be good for your office here .
uh , crystal ?
set up a meeting with dean .
uh , no .
well , have your secretary do it .
i don &apos;t care .
no , thank you .
i &apos;m going in another direction .
uh , now , look ,
i know you &apos;re new to this office ,
so i &apos;ll cut you a little slack .
but i spent a lot of zeros to help you get elected .
and i appreciate your contribution .
i don &apos;t want your appreciation .
i want you to appoint dean as your number two man .
okay , well , i &apos;m so glad you stopped by , mr. redmayne .
my , my , my . i @-@ i spent seven figures ...
putting you into office .
it won &apos;t cost me nearly as much to get you out of it .
hello , mrs. florrick .
oh , aha , another suitor .
my , my goodness .
i should have known .
it &apos;s always the colored guys .
excuse me ?
no , no , don &apos;t worry about it .
i @-@ i &apos;m on your side , you got it ?
i gave enough to the negro college fund
to give the whole friggin &apos; congo a scholarship .
let &apos;s go , doll . you know , this , um ,
this may seem like power to you , but it isn &apos;t .
you give me 20 hours ,
i &apos;ll show you power .
excuse me .
who the hell was that ?
shall we close the door ?
no , that &apos;s not necessary .
for my benefit , then .
i &apos;ll get it .
it was a close race .
it was .
well , congratulations .
thank you .
i want to talk about my future .
and yours .
i &apos;m ready to leave the business .
you are ?
my son is at the age now
where i want to devote more time to him .
good .
smart .
but i &apos;ll need your help .
with your son ?
uh , no .
with my transition .
out of the business .
do you want me to leave ?
no .
it might make things smoother .
no , i think it &apos;s better if marissa stays .
i &apos;ve noticed what happens
when people of my stature leave the business .
they lose their power , and they either ...
become imprisoned or deceased .
i can prevent the latter .
i need your help in preventing the former .
what help ?
i need you to stop geneva pine &apos;s investigation .
what investigation ?
into me .
i suggest this , mr. bishop ,
i will cheerfully quash the investigation into you
and offer you a full grant of immunity
in trade for your testimony against your lieutenants .
you know i would never do that .
you &apos;re turning over a new leaf .
for your son .
i funded your pac .
i started your pac .
i kept it going ...
i never asked you to .
please extend me the courtesy of not interrupting .
i spent $ 1 million on your campaign .
that &apos;s a lot of money .
i don &apos;t expect to be treated like the hired help .
mr. bishop , i &apos;m not treating you ...
i &apos;ll go public .
about my support .
you can , but the campaign laws also protect me .
i can &apos;t coordinate with my pac .
this was not a smart move .
this was not a smart move at all .
all right , where were we ?
uh , you were asking my client for $ 28 million .
which i said wasn &apos;t an offer .
it was a punch line .
your contention is
that the market for your movie in brain was strangled
by the downloads of said film .
the illegal downloads .
uh , you are aware
that in brain , uh , was released
on , uh , wharfmaster on february 3 of this year ?
i am , two days before it opened in theaters .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m suing you .
and do you know who uploaded it ?
probably some hacker in his mother &apos;s basement .
no , it was you .
excuse me ?
this file was uploaded by gemstone publicity ,
one of your contractors . as you can see ,
the , uh , digital code is identical .
come on , gemstone &apos;s got nothing to do with us .
they &apos;re a pr company that we hired to do viral marketing .
to build buzz for the movie .
and part of that &quot; buzz &quot; was on wharfmaster .
right , um , why don &apos;t we take a moment here ?
what the hell are you doing ?
uh , thank you , pastor jeremiah .
no , no , no .
i appreciate it .
okay .
good , good @-@ bye .
you were saying ?
what the hell are you doing ?
hi , dad .
oh , don &apos;t &quot; hi , dad &quot; me .
you &apos;re supposed to be keeping her in line .
eli , can you give me a subject , please ?
anything ?
guy redmayne-- he just called me .
you mean the man , guy redmayne , who came in here
and pressed his groin against me ,
compared my feet to those of an arizona prostitute ,
and then demanded that i hire a deputy sa of his choosing ?
yes , him . so ?
so i told him no .
i told him it was my choice .
and , yes , his money got me elected ,
but that didn &apos;t make me his servant .
ugh , dear god , of course it didn &apos;t make you his servant .
yeah , and that &apos;s what i told him .
alicia , i have spent a long time being your confidant and friend .
we have disagreed on many things ,
but i have always respected you , always , until now .
eli .
i won &apos;t be like peter .
then don &apos;t be .
of course you &apos;re gonna make your own decision ,
of course you &apos;re not gonna do what redmayne asks ,
but you don &apos;t tell him that .
you don &apos;t tell him the truth .
no , shut up .
listen to me .
you know the truth .
here , in your heart .
good , be a disney princess ,
but don &apos;t tell moneymen like redmayne anything
but what they want to hear .
even if it &apos;s a lie ?
yes , because it won &apos;t be a lie
when you tell it .
absence of yes times time equals no .
that &apos;s the law .
if you &apos;re in doubt , you don &apos;t say no ,
you say , &quot; thank you for your advice .
all options are open to me .
i plan to decide in the next 48 hours . &quot;
well , what happens in 48 hours ?
you do whatever you like , or you delay again ,
but you never , ever say no , because anything could happen .
redmayne will get just as angry if she delays .
no , he won &apos;t .
men like him don &apos;t want you to say yes ,
they want you to say , &quot; i &apos;m listening . &quot;
they want to be able to tell their friends ,
&quot; i have the ear of the sa . she listens to me . &quot;
he &apos;s rich , he &apos;s forgetful .
alicia , look at me !
i know of which i speak , and you don &apos;t .
and you don &apos;t either .
so what do i do ?
i bring redmayne back in here , and you kiss his ass .
and you shut the hell up .
okay ?
do what you have to do .
he &apos;s right about unclean hands .
our clients created the problem for which he is suing .
hmm , so what are we supposed to argue ?
our client only wanted his copyright infringed a little ?
no , we pivot .
trademark tarnishment ?
are you kidding me ?
no , sir .
we &apos;re not arguing copyright infringement ,
which is , as you know , hard to win .
we are arguing that you tarn ...
i &apos;m not sure how you can win that .
uh , in brain was released in 4k ,
the highest resolution possible .
kalinda .
oh , here we go .
superwoman is back .
i &apos;m now searching for in brain , and ...
... the banner ads-- they &apos;re hard @-@ core porn .
oh , come on .
mr. dalton , are you careful where you advertise your movie ?
very careful .
you would never associate
with a porn site like ...
&quot; teenagers and hounds &quot; ?
no , one is very careful with one &apos;s brand .
i see .
one might even call this ... trademark tarnishment .
mr. redmayne , you had some advice
you wanted to share with alicia .
uh , i did , but i don &apos;t think she wants to hear it .
oh , she does , alicia &apos;s just a little thrown
by all the changes in her circumstances , aren &apos;t you ?
yes , i &apos;m sorry , mr. redmayne .
i was trying to get my bearings here ,
and i &apos;m , uh , afraid i came across more boldly
than i wanted to .
i don &apos;t think i understand .
well , what alicia means is ...
no , i know what you think she means .
i want to hear what she thinks she means .
i want to hear your advice , mr. redmayne .
all options ...
are open to me as sa .
and , uh , i will decide
what to do in the next 48 hours .
guy .
guy .
uh , what do you think , crystal ?
is this a bad penny ?
guy , you wanted
a welcome ear in the sa &apos;s office , well , alicia is it .
you like taylor swift ?
excuse me ?
taylor swift , you know , &quot; shake that thing . &quot;
uh , what is it ?
&quot; shake it off . &quot;
&quot; sh @-@ shake it off , &quot; right .
&quot; shake it off , &quot; i love that song .
do you ?
do i ?
uh , do i ?
yes .
the current sa , what &apos;s his name ?
castro .
yeah , castro . right .
he &apos;s been looking into some real estate deals
of mine in jefferson park .
it &apos;s nothing more than a shakedown .
but i &apos;d like to be relieved of the @-@ the tension .
well , all options are open to me , guy .
i like that .
eli , you &apos;re a man of great depth .
i &apos;ve always told you that , sir .
yeah , now i &apos;m a believer .
praise jesus .
i &apos;ll be seeing you , alicia .
give me a hug .
come on .
we can ...
i have to say i was surprised by the invitation to come back .
well , alicia called me
and said she wasn &apos;t thrilled
with the way she left it .
i probably spoke too soon about your chief deputy .
and some other issues .
i &apos;m so glad to hear it .
all options are open to me ,
and i plan to decide in 48 hours .
web sites ?
yes , what sort of web sites do you search
when you surf the web , ms. sharma ?
i do research for the firm ,
track down witnesses .
case work .
you surf a lot of porn , ms. sharma ?
no .
uh , you are under oath , ma &apos;am .
oh , i &apos;m not married .
you don &apos;t need to address me as ma &apos;am .
thanks-- you surf a lot of porn , mademoiselle ?
no .
ms. sharma , whose computer did you use ?
i.
so this is your laptop ?
well , i use it .
i use it only when i don &apos;t want
to use the one that &apos;s on my desk .
and do you surf a lot of porn , sir ?
well , define &quot; surf . &quot;
what does this have to do with trademark tarnishment ?
wharfmaster &apos;s ads are targeted .
advertisers track a user &apos;s online behavior
and tailor ads to them .
the only people who see ads for pornography
are people who like it .
wait a minute , i don &apos;t like pornography .
i just , you know ...
i get targeted , i just get targeted .
oh , uh , why don &apos;t we take a break here ?
we can bump it up $ 50,000 .
you &apos;re serious .
$ 50,000 bump for alicia &apos;s exit package .
yes .
you see , we &apos;re ten feet apart , and you offer an inch .
i wish we were in a better position to offer more .
problem is , we don &apos;t have any leverage .
they know that you need to divest now .
no , the problem is cary &apos;s pissed at me .
i can maybe get him to eke out another $ 75,000 .
i &apos;ll have two kids in college .
an sa &apos;s salary will never cover that .
let me mull it over a little .
think of another angle .
finn .
yeah ?
how would you feel about being my number two
in the sa &apos;s office ?
what ?
you know the job better than i do .
and ...
we work well together .
look , i &apos;m flattered , but ...
but what ?
i don &apos;t know .
well , think about it .
i will .
thanks to you and the lakeshore women &apos;s group , mrs. riggin ,
for the wine .
right , i meant biscotti .
mom ?
yes , okay . hope to see you soon . thank you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
i was googling coverage of your election win .
oh , don &apos;t read any of it . some of it will be nasty .
no , there was a hit on this site called legal scholar today .
it &apos;s like , um , like a gawker for the legal world .
they posted e @-@ mails from your firm .
from my ... what e @-@ mails ?
oh , my god .
this one &apos;s from today .
d. lockhart to : c. agos .
subject : alicia &apos;s exit package . &quot;
oh , my god !
&quot; alicia has full plate . string out negotiations best strategy .
let &apos;s frustrate into accepting initial offer . &quot;
how much of this is there ?
a lot . like , a lot a lot .
somebody must &apos;ve hacked your system .
are there any from me ?
oh . oh , oh , this is wonderful .
cary agos to carey zepps .
&quot; fourth consecutive case diane refuses to settle .
clearly a senior moment .
need to loosen her up . &quot;
&quot; maybe we can ask mcveigh to do a better job in the sack ,
get the stick out of her ass . &quot;
who wrote that ? david lee ?
cary .
uh , did you see the one from january 8 ?
&quot; julius is coming back from new york .
great , more affirmative action bs . &quot;
&quot; did you see what she wore ?
ten bucks says she &apos;s noisy . &quot;
who is that ?
carey zepps .
he thinks we &apos;re sleeping with each other .
and you apparently called david lee a racist fruitcake .
what ? when ?
i mean , i know he is , but ...
i don &apos;t remember writing that .
well , that &apos;s nothing compared to kalinda .
so you performed oral sex on howard lyman in a supply closet ?
what ?
that &apos;s ... that &apos;s what he &apos;s saying .
he &apos;s saying , &quot; good lay . real firecracker . &quot;
&quot; the good mr. lee has done gilbert and sullivan .
the question is , has he done gilbert or sullivan ? &quot;
or try this one . diane replying to david lee :
&quot; cary good lawyer , not great lawyer .
going to prison not total loss for us . &quot;
you &apos;re kidding .
all right , is everyone here ? ladies and gentlemen .
quiet .
go ahead .
okay .
i &apos;ve disconnected your computers from the network . no e @-@ mails .
oh , are you kidding ?
what ?
if you need to write something ,
do it on paper . now , uh , yeah .
i &apos;m gonna need all your cell phones .
i need cell phones .
i want to tell everyone here ...
quiet .
shut up in back !
there seems to be a misunderstanding here
that i am gay .
i am not gay .
i am dating a woman , in fact .
and i will sue anyone here ...
who suggests that i was hired because of affirmative action .
that &apos;s what you people always do .
david , come on .
we people ? have you noticed you &apos;re surrounded
by rich people ?
listen to you , huh ?
that &apos;s what you people always do .
okay , all right ...
and i do not pick my nose during client meetings .
tell it to the disgusted clients .
i have a deviated septum , all right ?
things get caught up there but i do not bring them to the meeting .
calm down , let &apos;s calm down . come on .
we all said things that we didn &apos;t mean .
even things , diane , that we should take back .
what , like removing a stick from my ass ?
excuse me , you said i wasn &apos;t much of a lawyer .
everyone , let &apos;s just calm down .
every single partner had their e @-@ mails hacked except you .
how is that possible ?
because they only released them from the last four months .
i was using my campaign e @-@ mail .
wow . lucky .
the recriminations stop now .
everyone wrote things in those e @-@ mails that they clearly regret .
yes , and things that weren &apos;t true ... howard .
what ? you and i were in the supply closet .
what ? no , we weren &apos;t . what planet are you living on ?
stop . stop !
we need to focus on our cases
or there will be a mass exodus of clients .
kalinda ?
okay , odds are this is a hacker &apos;s reaction to
the wharfmaster case .
i mean , nathan bacevich is a hero in the cyber world .
do we think this is anonymous ?
i don &apos;t know . i mean , they usually announce themselves ,
but let me see what i can dig up ,
but this one &apos;s not gonna be easy .
i want an update every 30 minutes .
let &apos;s get back to work .
and remember : normalcy .
after you , my dear .
you and i are gonna have a serious chat .
oh , wait .
i got an e @-@ mail .
what is it ?
from e.e.-- no other name .
&quot; this is just the first batch .
tomorrow , we will release two years of e @-@ mails . &quot;
two years ?
yes .
does kalinda have any idea who &apos;s doing this ?
no .
but ...
it &apos;s because of the illegal download case , right ?
i can explain that !
break it up . break it ... stop it !
get out of here . what the hell is wrong with you ?
it &apos;s like a pirate ship here .
do you have any problems over the last two years ?
yes .
yeah , me , too .
and just to warn you , i probably said some things
when we were arguing at the firm .
same here .
let &apos;s agree :
you see any e @-@ mails from me about you , delete it .
yes .
and you , too .
agreed .
good .
what a nightmare .
i need you to do me a favor .
sure . what , shoot you now ?
take my laptop ,
go through all my e @-@ mails from the last two years
and find out what i said .
that &apos;s a lot of e @-@ mails .
can i do a word search ?
sure .
with what ?
anything with will or ...
elfman ?
no , that wouldn &apos;t be on my work e @-@ mail .
bishop .
really ?
not sexual . business .
and peter . anything with peter . not just his ...
tell me it &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s okay ,
we &apos;re on top of it .
on top of what ?
the e @-@ mails .
wait , what are you talking about ?
finn polmar . tell me you did not ask him to be your number two .
and that &apos;s my cue .
he would make an excellent deputy .
and how did you even hear ?
don &apos;t you get it ?
when to say yes is just as important as when to say no .
wait , what are you talking about ? what e @-@ mail ?
nothig . it &apos;s something here .
alicia , you offered finn the job
because you like him and he &apos;s maybe even a good lawyer ,
but he doesn &apos;t do anything important for you .
you mean he doesn &apos;t do anything important for you .
next time say it to my face , jackass .
oh , but i have said it to your face , branch ,
i have said it to your face .
stupid son of a bitch .
everything all right here ?
it &apos;s a long story .
giving finn the job will be seen as a slap in the face
by every senior attorney in your office who was passed over .
every woman . every ...
african @-@ american .
where are you going ?
out .
i &apos;m a superstar , kalinda , uh ,
but one thing i can &apos;t do is track a hack back to a hacker .
okay , but you can identify the i.p. addresses they &apos;re using .
sure , but they &apos;re just false fronts .
they bounce around a thousand different servers ,
and every one of them is anonymized .
so there &apos;s nothing we can do ?
this is a hacker chat room . read some of these messages .
&quot; this law firm needs to be punished ! &quot;
&quot; time for some a.p.t. &quot; ?
advanced persistent threat .
oh .
&quot; dox @-@ p , anyone ? &quot;
right.the thing is , there &apos;s no way to know
if this is all just angry talk ,
or if any of this is real .
or maybe there is .
what they &apos;re doing to me is a blow against freedom for all of us .
today it &apos;s wharfmaster . tomorrow , who knows ?
nathan was complaining , not stirring anything up .
i believe it &apos;s called free speech .
it &apos;s called intimidation .
your client incited hackers to attack us
to get us to back off .
you know , we could settle this right now
and make all your problems go away .
you have incredible chutzpah , jared .
no , diane , i have a winning case .
well , you and your case can go to hell .
you lived there for a year ?
six months on a kibbutz , six months in jerusalem .
what was israel like ? hot .
do you think i &apos;d like living there ?
no .
&apos;cause i &apos;m christian ?
no , there are a ton of christians there ,
all with cameras . because it &apos;s hot .
you spent a year living where it all began .
you must have felt , like , i don &apos;t know-- inspired .
no , just hot .
and gassy . you eat a lot of falafel .
marissa &apos;s trying to convince me to not live in israel .
really ?
hey , grace , can you give me and marissa a moment ?
yeah . just let me know when you want to eat .
okay .
the e @-@ mails ?
yeah . i went through about 5,000 .
how bad ?
well , there &apos;s one where you call a donor
&quot; the worst kind of sexist pig-- a pompous sexist pig . &quot;
another where you tell cary agos that finn polmar
is &quot; soft and malleable with a spine of cottage cheese . &quot;
i was trying to buck cary up during his trial .
at the bottom is one from your gynecologist .
it &apos;s your question about the reliability of pregnancy tests .
i was late .
hey , i &apos;m just the messenger .
okay , so ...
these aren &apos;t good , but they &apos;re not overly awful .
um ... those are just the ones i marked questionable .
these are the ones i marked bad .
i highlighted them in red .
this one &apos;s from will gardner
right after some new york conference .
he talks about you two .
oh , my god .
yeah .
and ... this one was kind of unexpected .
&quot; relax . it was just a one @-@ night stand ,
albeit a great one . &quot; that was from you to elfman .
but how did this even get in ... here ?
i ... i never wrote jon from my campaign or my work e @-@ mail .
you probably toggled the wrong account .
it was quaint .
you don &apos;t really see &quot; albeit &quot; in too many e @-@ mails .
what am i gonna do ?
stop these e @-@ mails from getting out there .
how ?
braden v. campbell-- puntitives for invasion of privacy
stemming from the unauthorized publication of a diary .
so we argue every e @-@ mail hacked is like a diary entry .
no .
you have to settle this .
the firm &apos;s reputation can &apos;t handle another dump .
the firm &apos;s reputation , ms. state &apos;s attorney ?
your e @-@ mails were noticeably absent
from the first dump , alicia .
you &apos;re going to clean that up !
our interests are aligned here .
respectfully , alicia , our interests have not been aligned
since you used our office as a staging ground for your political career .
have you read the last two years of e @-@ mails ?
this one &apos;s from will to me ,
november 12 , 2013 .
&quot; alicia , can you meet with sweeney tomorrow at 3 : 00 ?
our favorite wife @-@ killing psycho has requested your presence . &quot;
diane , this one &apos;s from you .
monday , june 3 , 2013 .
&quot; let &apos;s huddle about the connolly billings .
&quot; i want to head that geriatric blimp off at the pass . &quot;
yes .
we need to settle .
now .
no .
mr. dalton , $ 500,000
at least gives you something .
it &apos;s a drop in the bucket for wharfmaster .
i want that arrogant son of a bitch out of business .
well , then at this time ,
we need to notify you that we are withdrawing as your counsel .
what ? given the damage
we &apos;ve already incurred from that hack ,
we can &apos;t continue in an effective capacity .
but we can refer you to a number of excellent law firms .
you think a single one
would take me on after what happened to you ?
we &apos;re stuck with each other , ms. lockhart .
mr. dalton , our firm is undergoing a catas ...
no . listen , you undertook an obligation to represent me .
now , you &apos;re going to fulfill it .
or we can ask the judge what he thinks .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
oh , my ...
eli .
would you please stop saying that ?
phone sex ?
it was two years ago .
question is , what do we do , dad ?
these aren &apos;t out yet ?
no , the threat is that they &apos;ll get dumped today ,
and the question is , do i apologize
to people beforehand ?
no .
never apologize beforehand .
you never know what &apos;s gonna happen .
i disagree .
well , bully for you .
when you have more than four months &apos; experience ,
come back and we &apos;ll listen .
in the real world , where real people live ,
not politicians , there &apos;s something to be said
for preparing a client to hear that you called them
an &quot; arrogant , sweaty misanthrope . &quot;
you put that in an e @-@ mail ?
look , it &apos;s a corollary to the never @-@ say @-@ no principle .
always best to do nothing when you don &apos;t have to do anything .
it shows consideration .
it shows weakness .
and most importantly , it may not happen .
excuse me .
no . no . whatever you &apos;re gonna do , no .
i &apos;m sorry .
what for ?
for an e @-@ mail i sent about you .
what e @-@ mail ?
i said you were soft ... and malleable ,
with a spine like cottage cheese .
cottage cheese ?
it was during cary &apos;s trial ,
when everything was getting crazy .
and did you believe it ?
no . no . alicia , if you &apos;re looking
to rescind the offer to be your chief deputy ... - what ?
no . i mean , this whole thing is ... it ...
of course the offer still stands .
okay , then .
bygones .
really ?
sure .
mr. bishop .
hello .
i think we got off on the wrong foot .
shall we go up to my office ?
no . here &apos;s fine .
you &apos;re probably right
about the pac information not hurting you .
let &apos;s go upstairs .
no .
but i did give my captains walking @-@ around money
to get the vote out in the african @-@ american communities .
you know , the communities where you were weak .
i didn &apos;t ask you to do that , sir .
it gets a bit confusing about who asked who to do what .
that &apos;s my impression , anyway .
so maybe you should think about
the geneva pine investigation .
okay ?
thank you for your thoughts , mr. bishop .
all options are open to me ,
and i plan to decide in the next 48 hours .
good . then i &apos;ll sit tight and wait to hear from you .
i appreciate your openness .
you know , i sense something between us .
want to grab some dinner one night ? huh ?
please tell me you &apos;ve made some headway on these hackers .
no , but i may have found something on nathan bacevich .
remember he said that he saw in brain when it first came out ?
yes , and wasn &apos;t impressed .
yeah . but it was only in the u.s. theaters
from february 5 through march 6 .
bacevich was in europe promoting wharfmaster .
so where did he watch it ?
you used your own site to download it , illegally ,
despite your repeated denials
that you and your web site knowingly violated
copyright infringement laws .
congratulations , mr. bacevich .
you lied under oath and can now be prosecuted for perjury .
we have enough to win this , nathan ,
and your attorney knows that .
and if we press the perjury charge ,
you could go to prison .
we will go as low as $ 15 million .
here &apos;s the only deal we &apos;ll agree to .
an apology ...
from mr. dalton
for bringing a frivolous lawsuit to mr. bacevich .
what the hell ?
excuse me ?
i &apos;m sorry , are we in upside @-@ down land here ?
no , sir .
we are very much right @-@ side up ,
and the view is very clear .
you have two hours , or the deal is off the table .
this is disgusting ! it &apos;s the triumph of the anarchists .
no , it isn &apos;t .
you know , the next killer app
isn &apos;t coming from some corporate office in seattle or san jose ,
it &apos;s coming from some 16 @-@ year @-@ old in warsaw
who gets excited by a 14 @-@ year @-@ old &apos;s code in mumbai .
you obsess so much about copyright and drms ,
you &apos;re missing what &apos;s great about what &apos;s going on .
you &apos;re building fences , and we &apos;re trying to tear them all down ,
not because we hate you ,
but because we &apos;re trying to build the next big thing .
let us do it .
because it &apos;s gonna happen either way .
take the deal .
um , excuse me ?
we are winning this , sir .
no , we &apos;re not .
my company &apos;s e @-@ mails were just hacked , too .
take ... the deal .
if the hacker or hackers
was looking to rain a little havoc on us ...
they sure succeeded .
wildly .
so ...
... i think an apology &apos;s in order .
from whom to whom ?
take your pick .
i was blowing off steam .
yes , you were pigheaded ,
belligerent , and arrogant to the extreme ...
but you &apos;re , uh ...
you &apos;re also a hell of a lawyer .
a fruitcake ?
we settled the wharfmaster case .
thank you .
yeah . let the bad guys win .
well , it was the only move , which means it was the smart move .
it &apos;s not a pretty picture
when you see what people really think of you .
i don &apos;t think it is , really , what people think of you .
i think sometimes you just have to ...
let off steam , say something nasty .
and sometimes the nasty thing is what people really think .
sometimes .
is this a joke ?
$ 100,000 total ? that is a quarter million
below your initial offer .
this hack has been a game changer .
we have to buy a whole new computer network and e @-@ mail system .
not to mention new laptops , cell phones , ipads .
there &apos;s nothing more to give .
alicia ...
you should take it .
i &apos;ll consider it .
and i want you all to know ...
that this offer does not in any way
impact my consideration of your criminal cases
when i &apos;m sa .
was that a thinly veiled threat ?
nope . very clear one .
she wouldn &apos;t dare .
you want to chance it ?
so , are you safe ?
for the moment , yes .
and redmayne and castro are satisfied ?
happy days .
so , what did we learn ?
hell if i know .
go slow , choose carefully .
right .
do you know neil sands ?
do i ... no .
he &apos;s a lawyer over at justice .
african @-@ american .
dad was a cop . he is by all accounts a topnotch attorney .
he &apos;d be a great number two .
what do you think ?
thank you for your advice , eli .
all options are open to me ,
and i plan to decide in 48 hours .
