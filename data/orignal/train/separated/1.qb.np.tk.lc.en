money .
how much money ?
twice what i &apos;m making here .
and all for the price of your soul .
not my whole soul , just little pieces of it .
anyway , i heard defense attorneys have better sex .
if you like coming from behind .
oh , god ...
okay , no .
oh , come on , dana .
we said no as long as we were coworkers .
yeah , we ... we &apos;re still coworkers .
yeah , for one more week .
not to be too much of a pessimist ,
but i don &apos;t think you &apos;re gonna survive it .
oh , really ?
yeah . you &apos;re like
a cop with one week left on the job .
they all get shot .
can &apos;t risk the wait .
cary , i have a boyfriend .
so do i.
well , my guess is my boyfriend &apos;s bigger than yours .
okay .
these cases , i can &apos;t finish in a week .
i will them to you .
oh ... great .
no sex and half your file work--
i really feel like i &apos;m losing here .
yeah , but you have one less body to step over on your way to the top .
must be your boyfriend .
checking in on me .
hello , dear . how are you ?
i &apos;m good , cary . how about you ?
i &apos;m good , matan .
really ? you and matan ?
i just got a call about
an asa needed at a crime scene for some kind of legal issue .
i was gonna head down , but it turns out
lockhart &amp; gardner are the defense attorneys on it .
so lucky you .
what &apos;s the legal issue ?
no idea .
this sounds like hazing .
it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
let me give you the address , dear .
and that &apos;s all i do ?
that &apos;s all you do .
just hit the return key ,
and it &apos;s on your computer at work .
but why does it never seem so simple ?
because you don &apos;t trust technology .
hey , you guys have all your bags packed and ready , right ?
because dad &apos;s gonna be here any minute .
hey , mom ?
yes ?
what do you do when we &apos;re at dad &apos;s ?
what do i do ?
uh , not much .
i miss you two .
for about an hour .
and then i do some laundry ,
i read for work . why ?
do you ever go out ?
uh , for dinner ? sometimes .
with friends ?
sometimes .
what friends ?
friends from work . or clients .
people we know ?
no , i don &apos;t think you do .
we &apos;re just worried about you , mom .
honey ... i &apos;m fine . really .
mom , it &apos;s work .
will gardner .
okay , thanks .
i @-@ i &apos;m gonna ... just take that in there .
hang it up .
i was .
sorry about calling you at home .
no problem . everything all right ?
yes . actually , this is about work .
oh . good .
i mean , i &apos;m here .
your new hire , the first @-@ year ?
caitlin .
yes . a call came in about the jin @-@ pyn account .
she was the only one here .
she went out on it , but i think she &apos;ll need some hand @-@ holding .
oh , o @-@ okay . um , what &apos;s it about ?
no idea . but the son seems to be in some kind of legal trouble .
mom ! it &apos;s dad !
i &apos;ll be right there .
do you have the address ?
should have guessed .
what ?
booze cruise .
$ 50 , all the beer you can drink .
down there .
you did that in college ?
i did a lot of things in college .
only one band .
a seasickness band .
you wear them in pairs .
you &apos;re not gonna leave .
you &apos;re too good at this .
that &apos;s what they say to the cop with only one week left .
five miles out someone found the deceased ,
a maya nichols , below deck ,
called the police .
witnesses say she was getting unwanted attention
from two college kids .
we were just about to haul &apos; em in for a suspect rape exam
when this joker showed up .
you are the authority here ?
i am . what seems to be the problem ?
the problem is , mr. anders is the son of a dutch courier
at our embassy , and is therefore covered by diplomatic immunity .
i was not there ! i was not !
these are my papers ,
and these are the papers of mr. anders .
who &apos;s that ?
uh , jin @-@ pyn .
supposedly , he &apos;s got diplomatic immunity , too .
chinese ambassador &apos;s on his way .
per the viennese convention on diplomatic relations ,
mr. anders is to be treated ...
yes , i heard you .
thought there was some lockhart / gardner connection .
yes . me . here .
i don &apos;t think i know you .
you don &apos;t .
caitlin d &apos;arcy . i &apos;m new as of last week .
okay . well , what do you have to offer ?
nothing . i &apos;m just taping everything you do .
well , uh ...
i &apos;m cary agos , and ... these two youths
are under investigation for rape and murder .
they have legal immunity .
from prosecution , not investigation .
so unless they want to confess , i &apos;m investigating .
go ahead , detective , take them in .
this is illegal .
now , who is your boss ?
the people of illinois .
you want their number ?
you feeling pretty good about yourself ?
yeah , but how do i look ?
caitlin , what &apos;s going on ?
mrs. florrick , hello .
he &apos;s being accused of rape and murder .
have you told him his rights ?
i was asked to stand outside-- they &apos;re doing a suspect exam .
chen , my name is alicia florrick .
i &apos;m your parents &apos; lawyer .
it is your right to have me observe the suspect exam .
do you approve ?
i , uh ... yeah .
ma &apos;am , please , step back through .
it is his sixth amendment right that i be here .
chen , did they tell you you had the right to remain silent ?
i didn &apos;t do it .
i know .
i need you to only talk to me .
do you understand ?
i promised dick i wouldn &apos;t talk .
here . left earring stud .
blond hair , two inches long .
mrs. florrick ?
i &apos;m from the dutch embassy .
i &apos;m here to see mr. anders .
we &apos;re getting everything sorted out , sir .
who &apos;s the asa ?
i am . who are you ?
judge winter .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m sorry . i ...
your honor ,
i represent mr. chen jin @-@ pyn .
he is the son of a diplomatic translator ,
and therefore is guaranteed ...
yes , and that &apos;s why i was yanked out of my house
in the middle of the night . where is he ?
your honor , there is strong evidence
that these two men raped and killed ...
i &apos;m sorry to say that &apos;s not relevant .
given their immunity status , you have no right to hold them .
this is a court order requiring their immediate release .
your honor . cary , you can hold one of them . taiwan .
uh , your honor ,
excuse me , i @-@ i understand we have to release mr. dick anders ,
given his status as a dutch citizen ,
but jin @-@ pyn is taiwanese ,
and taiwan enjoys no such diplomatic status .
how is that ?
the one china rule .
the u.s. government
extends diplomatic relations to china but not taiwan .
your honor , this is a gray area .
not in matters of diplomatic immunity .
taiwan is the only &quot; nation &quot; not accorded such rights .
your honor , this isn &apos;t the united nations .
you can &apos;t just keep one and let the other go .
actually , that &apos;s exactly what i can do .
i order the release of mr. anders but not mr. jin @-@ pyn .
that is unfair , your honor .
good luck , buddy . i &apos;m out of here .
of course it is .
when have you ever known international politics to be fair .
well , you really stirred up the hornet &apos;s nest .
it was a rape @-@ murder-- i held both suspects as long as i could .
so , where are we ?
no semen , but we believe it was an attempted rape ;
she resisted ; chen killed her .
murder weapon ?
none found . blunt head trauma .
what does the client say happened ?
caitlin ?
he says they both flirted with the victim ,
and then his friend anders went off with her .
but we can &apos;t get to anders ?
no , he was released .
well , that &apos;s not good .
what else ties him to the girl ?
the blond hair caught in chen &apos;s left earring stud .
no pubic hair ?
none .
oh , dana , you &apos;re still here .
six more days of bliss .
any blood spatter ?
on chen , no .
what do you think the defense will be ?
to blame the one that got away .
too bad there &apos;s one that got away .
and our strategy ?
connect anders to the rape .
did the police do a suspect exam ?
on anders , no . he was released prior .
hm . and what about the blond hair on our guy ?
how does he explain that ?
chen says they made out .
it was consensual .
then chen went to go buy the victim a drink ,
and anders took her below deck .
a drink ?
i thought it was a booze cruise .
just beer and wine .
hard alcohol , you had to pay .
we have chen &apos;s credit card receipt with the time on it ,
so if they police can pinpoint the time of the murder ,
we can prove that chen was on the other end of the boat .
eli gold , ladies and gentlemen .
you needed me ?
you push this off on me and then you criticize my handling of it ?
i wasn &apos;t trying to criticize you .
did i give you that impression ?
you did .
my apologies .
what was that about ?
we were trying to make you feel part of the lockhart / gardner family .
don &apos;t you want to feel a part ?
oh . i &apos;m okay .
what do you need ?
lobbying .
the son of a taiwanese diplomat
is being denied immunity
from prosecution due to the one china rule .
oy . that thicket .
yep , that thicket .
i thought if you could talk to someone quietly ,
we could make this go away without much fuss .
know anyone in the state department ?
yes ?
nothing .
how important is it ?
heading into the presidential campaign ,
my guess is taiwan will be spending a lot on u.s. lobbyists .
could be lucrative ...
for you .
okay .
this is not going to be pretty .
sorry you had to see that . definitely not my finest hour .
no , it &apos;s cool . you were a good judge .
okay , the less said about that , the better .
oh , alicia .
mr. gardner was a judge in my intercollegiate moot court .
really ?
till i was removed . bias .
yeah , they had , like , some 60 @-@ year @-@ old come in .
anyway ...
yeah . caitlin .
oh , sorry . orientation , right ?
go get orientated .
so , this binder has all your human resource forms ,
a fax sheet on billing , aba , pro bono requirements .
great , thanks .
he &apos;s nice , isn &apos;t he ?
who , will gardner ?
yes . so is diane . they &apos;re both also busy .
so if there &apos;s anything you need , you come to me first .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . did i just embarrass myself ?
no , no , no , you did fine .
oh , god , i did , didn &apos;t i ?
caitlin , you were fine . here , work over here .
go ahead , start filling these out .
thanks a lot .
excuse me .
this is my office .
then i guess you can do whatever you want , can &apos;t you ?
i ...
may i help you ?
not anymore .
next time you need help with it , call me .
you don &apos;t just do it on your own .
look at this . look .
what did you do ?
what did i do ?
what did i ... ? okay .
it &apos;s your cloud , lady .
go live on it .
right there . her . closer .
hey , do you know how i get to the zoo ?
so you just troll along the lakefront looking for ex @-@ wives ?
no , just you .
your office told me you &apos;d be here .
so ...
you &apos;re really slowing down , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;ll just be a minute .
how &apos;s the presidential campaign going ?
why ? what did you hear ?
oh , god , you &apos;re paranoid .
no , i &apos;m a vegetarian .
since when ?
since we divorced .
what do you need ?
who do you know at state ?
a lot of people .
it &apos;s a taiwan issue .
a poor , innocent kid &apos;s been accused of ...
something or other ,
and they won &apos;t grant him diplomatic immunity .
do you want me to talk to doug rothstein ?
yeah . really ?
that &apos;d be great .
you &apos;re @-@ you &apos;re looking good , vanessa .
eli ?
your turn .
do you know kim kesler ?
kim ... kesler ? who &apos;s she ?
he . a political op out of california .
i thought you guys were all staffed up .
it &apos;s not for the president .
who then ?
me .
seriously , vanessa ?
seriously ?
he @-@ he approached me .
state senate .
oh , my god , you have that wild look in your eye .
rahm gets in , and everybody thinks they can .
it &apos;s a good time for a woman .
is that what kim kesler told you--
the man with a woman &apos;s name ?
i need your help , eli-- your professional opinion .
meet us for dinner tonight .
kim kesler . kick his tires .
see if he &apos;s real , or if he &apos;s selling me a bill of goods .
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re considering this .
i want to do something with my life .
you always used to say that .
well , now i mean it .
we &apos;re not having a moment .
no , no , we &apos;re not .
i &apos;m @-@ i &apos;m going , i &apos;m going .
mrs. florrick , can i show you something ?
what is it , caitlin ? i &apos;m a little busy .
it &apos;s probably nothing , but i think
i have something on the consensual . chen .
we have to prove that he made out with her consensually .
oh . sure .
okay , so i was looking at afterdeathspace for maya , the dead girl .
oh , afterdeathspace .
you know , when someone dies ,
and everybody wants to share stories and photos .
okay .
and what was cool is ,
everybody at the booze cruise was tweeting photos .
and so look .
but what was even more cool is ... look .
the color of her cup-- red .
okay .
it &apos;s a stoplight party , not a spectrum party .
a ... ?
a stoplight party .
oh , you carry a red cup to say you &apos;re in a relationship ,
a yellow cup to say you &apos;re choosy ,
and a green cup to say you &apos;re open .
but see ?
this one &apos;s from later--
an hour after the first pic .
and look at her cup . now it &apos;s green .
well , maybe it &apos;s a mistake .
take my word for it .
you know what cup you &apos;re carrying at a stoplight party .
so what made her switch from a red cup to a green one ?
yeah , got it . red to green .
okay , listen , i &apos;ll call you back .
so you &apos;re not with the police ?
no . you &apos;re maya &apos;s boyfriend , right ?
yeah . i was .
i already talked to the cops . i wasn &apos;t there .
but you were on the phone with her , right ?
at the booze cruise . she called you from it the night she died .
so ?
well , you broke up with her on the phone .
no .
listen , you &apos;re safe from arrest .
just tell me the truth .
i am .
she broke up with me .
she said she was tired of me
spending all my time with this waitress i know from ra sushi
but she was this mother of three , really nice ,
and i just like talking to her , you know ?
sure . um ...
and she wanted to be a philosophy major , too ,
back when she was in college .
it &apos;s not like i &apos;m a philosophy major yet .
i &apos;m still undecided about my major .
sure , look , don &apos;t worry about that .
i just like talking to her .
but you talked to her ?
who , the waitress ?
no . maya .
when she broke up with you , you talked to her , right ?
yeah , yeah .
i mean , no , no . she , um ...
she left me a voice mail .
do you have it ?
you are so full of yourself .
you think i can &apos;t do any guy here ?
can you e @-@ mail me that voice mail ?
yeah , sure . does it help ?
yeah , it does .
there &apos;s more if you want .
your phone just keeps cutting me off .
i just want ...
hey ! i said , don &apos;t touch me .
what ? i &apos;m not touching you .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
did you play that for anyone else ?
yeah .
who ?
hey ! i said , don &apos;t touch me .
what ? i &apos;m not touching you .
that &apos;s chen .
sounds like unwanted attention to me .
there goes consensual for them .
we should make an offer .
life ? no chance of parole ?
hey , cary .
sorry to interrupt .
we &apos;re gonna be shuffling the offices around a bit ,
so if you could get your stuff together
and be ready in the next few days , okay ?
uh , this is from peter ?
yup , he delegated to me .
what &apos;s going on there ?
it &apos;s a guy thing . office jockeying .
i don &apos;t think they can put you in any smaller of an office .
oh , they can .
oh , my mom &apos;s just downstairs .
you &apos;re zach , right ?
i &apos;m will gardner , your mom &apos;s boss .
so , no school today , huh ?
no , there was .
oh , it &apos;s 4 : 00 .
helping mom out ?
yeah .
well ...
keep on keepin &apos; on .
you should know something about your friend , cary .
my friend , cary ?
yeah , you should know something .
he has a thing for ethnic women .
oh . really ?
yeah , it &apos;s pretty obvious .
every black or hispanic woman through here .
wow . well , thank you for the warning .
got it working .
you did not .
i did . the it guy put on proprietary software ,
so he could charge your firm for every megabyte he stored .
that &apos;s why it rejected the transferring of your files .
what ? i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s really corrupt .
you don &apos;t need to be paying to store files .
in fact , it slows the system down .
really ?
yeah .
oh , your boss was in here . will .
yes , i @-@ i saw .
did you say hi ?
i did .
all right , i better go .
okay . i love you .
love you , too .
yeah ?
i want a car .
it &apos;s like moneyball .
politics doesn &apos;t have to be for the rich .
it &apos;s the true democratization of power in this country .
you have citizen engagement on one hand .
megatrend , right ?
i mean , everybody &apos;s talking about it .
mark penn , so on ,
and i &apos;m not even talking about rtr .
i mean , talk about real moneyball .
rtr ?
oh . jeez . real @-@ time response .
they hit vanessa , and bam , we hit back .
bam ! we hit back .
through ?
micro @-@ pockets of committed , citizen , online journalist bloggers .
each talking from a subset of their own communities .
let &apos;s say we have upstate agricultural sections , right ?
we also have the urban cities , right ?
we have activated in there ...
well , that went well .
you &apos;re not going with him . this was all a joke , right ?
he was trying to impress you .
oh , my god , vanessa , he is a clown .
then help me .
you were never going with him ?
are you kidding ?
citizen engagement , rtr .
he just gave me the bug .
so this was all so i would agree to help you ?
i &apos;m not going to be your campaign manager , vanessa .
i know .
just get me started . do some polling .
see if there &apos;s any interest , that &apos;s all .
see if i have the stomach for this .
you don &apos;t .
well , then , it &apos;ll be over fast .
so , what happened with the state department ?
oh , yeah , good news .
hello ?
the state department screwed you .
they &apos;re pushing for chen &apos;s release .
they don &apos;t want to isolate taiwan .
there &apos;s a hearing tomorrow .
damn it . he &apos;s guilty .
we just ... we just got this voice mail . it &apos;s a slam dunk .
yeah . too bad .
good , you got your stuff together .
i have another office for you down the hall .
i extend my sincere gratitude
to each and every one of you for being here tonight .
so he doesn &apos;t expect me ?
no , but he &apos;s cool-- an old family friend .
just don &apos;t get rambly on him .
uncle dan .
hey , how you doing ?
dana .
look at you .
dad told me you were in town .
you &apos;ve , uh , caught me playing hooky .
the same stump speech the 18th time ,
and you &apos;re allowed a little leeway .
know what i mean ?
oh , this is , this is cary .
uh , nice to meet you , sir .
oh , ignore him-- he calls everybody sir .
it &apos;s the straight , suburban thing .
uncle daniel works in the obama state department .
well , that sounds deathly formal .
so it &apos;s true-- you did break up with jimi ?
no , we &apos;re just ...
it &apos;s complicated .
anyway , cary and i work together at the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office .
oh , yeah , peter-- how &apos;s he doing ?
we worked together a long time ago .
good , he &apos;s good ,
he &apos;s good , but we &apos;re working on a case
involving the one china rule .
really ? well , that i have to hear all about .
good job .
ah , thanks , not too rambly ?
surprisingly not .
so matan says that you have a thing for ethnic women .
he what ?
he says you have a thing for ethnic women .
you just can &apos;t control yourself around us .
oh , i ... that &apos;s not true .
unless that &apos;s a good thing .
that depends .
on ... ?
i want you to vet my ex @-@ wife .
really ?
yeah , i know it sounds a bit weird ,
but she &apos;s thinking of running for state senate and she wants me to vet her .
all right , well , i have to do some work on taiwan first ,
but then , sure . how , how thorough should i be ?
as thorough as her enemies would be .
okay .
um ... this isn &apos;t about something else ?
you mean , am i jealous of my wife
and want to see who she &apos;s sleeping with ?
no .
okay .
oh , come on !
so this is a hearing into the status of
mr. jin @-@ pyn &apos;s diplomatic ... status .
don &apos;t worry , chen ,
you have the backing of the state department .
thank you .
i can &apos;t spend another day in here .
i don &apos;t know , they &apos;re smiling like they know something .
now let &apos;s begin .
i understand the defense has a witness .
yes , your honor , it is our contention that protections
of diplomatic immunity were denied our client
due to the peculiarities of taiwan .
to that end , we have asked a spokes ...
ma &apos;am , there &apos;s a call from the state department .
a mr. daniel golden would like to speak with you .
... a spokeswoman at the state department ...
yes , counselor ?
excuse me , your honor , if we could delay ...
as long as you want , counselor .
um , actually , your honor ,
we ask the court that reasonable bail be set ,
and we would have no objection to make home confinement a condition .
what happened ?
state worried that extending diplomatic immunity to the kid
would be a slap in the face to china .
okay , we have to get discovery .
none of your hair was found on the body , chen ,
but we did just get the lab report back
on the trace evidence .
there was a blond hair-- not maya &apos;s , a man &apos;s--
on her collar .
they don &apos;t know who it matches .
ander &apos;s .
that &apos;s what we think ,
but the police didn &apos;t do his suspect exam ,
so we have nothing to match it to .
do you have anything of his ?
anything that might have one of his hairs on it--
a brush or an item of clothing ?
i know his gym locker combination at school .
my brother left all my things in his locker .
he gave me the combination .
i &apos;ll be right in and out .
thanks .
it &apos;s the other seasickness band , cary .
how do i know you didn &apos;t plant it there , kalinda ?
because i didn &apos;t .
uh @-@ huh , and you just happened to know the number of anders &apos; locker ?
no , i just happen to be a very good investigator .
look , check if you don &apos;t believe me .
i &apos;ll get back to you .
okay , whatever .
we &apos;re all having to make sacrifices ,
but you have a window now at least .
that one .
the cubicle in the middle .
thanks .
you &apos;re welcome .
hi , uh , sorry to keep you waiting .
no problem , i keep myself busy .
you have a pretty office .
thank you .
start of a campaign , you work in versailles .
by the end , you &apos;re in motel 6--
not to disparage motel 6 .
i &apos;m a politician now .
so , uh , you , uh , married once to mr. gold ?
four happy years , eight medium ones , and two bad ones .
i hope that doesn &apos;t preclude me from running .
actually , i &apos;m not here to make judgment , just , just questions .
so why did you guys break up ?
uh , i think that was in the divorce settlement .
actually , it wasn &apos;t , just &quot; irreconcilable differences . &quot;
ah , well , that &apos;s what it was .
yeah , but i think we &apos;ll need to go deeper .
okay , uh , we were both working too hard .
i was having to take a lot of trips out of town .
yeah , uh , dubai , three trips .
yes . at that time , i was doing pr for an oil company .
and who did you meet there ?
who did i meet ? i-- do you want an itemized list ?
yeah .
just write down the ones that you remember .
are you looking for anyone in particular ?
yeah , uh , omar tate .
you &apos;re doing his dirty work for him , aren &apos;t you ?
eli &apos;s dirty work .
no .
he told you to ask me that .
no , my vetting is independent of mr. gold .
i don &apos;t believe you .
i understand that , but it &apos;s true .
it was a mistake , omar was a mistake .
uh , how many times did you meet ?
don &apos;t tell him .
i was young .
this is , this is merely part of the vetting .
don &apos;t tell him .
please .
yeah , i was on the booze cruise , too ,
but i just remember seeing maya by the bar .
did you see her with this man ?
no .
i mean , i saw him in the newspaper ,
but i didn &apos;t see them leave together .
i mean , we were both worried
about getting disconnected at parties ,
so we always kept track .
how did you keep track ?
oh , you know , that app .
what app ?
the rape app ?
have you heard of it ?
no , show me .
we both had it installed on our phones
so we could keep track of each other .
see , the gps shows you where your friend is .
there &apos;s a panic button .
yeah , i know .
that &apos;s what sucks .
the phone vibrated when maya pushed it ,
but the music was so loud and i was dancing ,
so i didn &apos;t feel it .
what ?
it has a history of when maya pushed the panic button .
yeah , i know , but it didn &apos;t show her location .
i know , but it shows what time she pressed the button .
11 : 33 .
yeah , i do see it .
11 : 34 p.m.
chen bought a mojito at 11 : 34 p.m.
why does that matter ?
a rape app ?
no , i &apos;ve never heard of that .
okay ,
well , if that &apos;s probative ,
then the state &apos;s attorney &apos;s office will question her , yep .
ha-- no , no , i think
it &apos;s a bit too early to talk about release .
yeah , okay , thank you , bye .
what was that ?
the defense attorneys .
they say they have the time of death
via a friend who received a signal
maya sent on something called a rape app .
do you believe them ?
i don &apos;t know .
nice office .
thanks .
i get a lot more air here .
chen did it , he did it .
how do you know ?
he &apos;s taiwanese-- he would sign his surname first .
hey , dick .
how &apos;s it going ?
i hear you stopped going to your anthropology class .
listen , i don &apos;t have to talk to you .
actually , you do because you stopped going
to your anthropology class .
what , what are you talking about ?
you haven &apos;t been in six weeks .
registrar officially dropped you from the class ,
so you &apos;re only taking eight hours now .
yeah , so , so what ?
so diplomatic immunity applies to diplomats &apos; children
up to the age of 23,
provided they are full @-@ time students .
you aren &apos;t anymore .
i can bring charges against you any time i want .
i didn &apos;t do it .
i believe you , but i think you know what happened ,
and i can make a case that you were part of it .
chen grabbed her seasickness band when he killed her .
didn &apos;t he ? and then he slipped it to you
to hide it , right ? okay .
that &apos;s your signature .
you used his credit card to buy a drink ,
and when you looked up , chen was gone .
he followed maya below deck where he killed her .
so ...
it &apos;s your choice .
you want to be a witness or an accomplice ?
how much do you want me to tell you ?
enough to know if she should run or not .
she shouldn &apos;t run .
okay . why ?
well , she was on the organizing board
for a fund @-@ raiser for rod blagojevich .
old news . what else ?
she &apos;s had relationships .
i figured . how many ?
a few .
but not slut level ?
no .
then we shouldn &apos;t have a problem .
kalinda , we are doctors discussing a patient .
what ?
well , one of them in particular is problematic .
omar tate .
he &apos;s a financier of high @-@ end resorts .
what is it ? criminal past ?
no .
no , he has a spotless record .
perfect credit , actually .
kalinda , you &apos;re being weird .
well , omar tate isn &apos;t his birth name .
it &apos;s aarash ...
bin laden .
come again ?
it &apos;s aarash bin laden , osama &apos;s second cousin .
my ex @-@ wife slept with a bin laden ?
listen , for what it &apos;s worth ,
aarash bin laden has never been linked
to terrorist activity of any kind .
oh , good . she banged a nice bin laden .
this is absurd .
when was this ?
and he has publicly denounced the actions of al qaeda .
wait . when was this ?
uh , you know , i think the details are in the file .
kalinda , when was this ?
2007 .
she was married to me .
i &apos;m sorry .
20 years , and that &apos;s my last , best and final .
that leaves me nowhere to go , cary .
go to your client .
well , how do you know dick &apos;s story is reliable ?
nah , i don &apos;t have to make my case to you , alicia .
take it or leave it .
but know that it has a 24 @-@ hour clock .
very impressive .
you heading out ?
yup . my last week here , and i haven &apos;t been shot .
the day &apos;s young yet .
do you think dick &apos;s telling the truth ?
i think he &apos;s afraid of prosecution ,
so he &apos;ll say whatever they want .
but it also could be the truth .
is that ... ?
that @-@ that &apos;s him . chen .
call him .
damn . it &apos;s cary .
hello ?
alicia , our office was notified your client
just broke his electronic perimeter .
what &apos;s going on ?
i @-@ i &apos;m not sure .
alicia , if you know your client is attempting to flee the jurisdiction ,
you have a legal obligation to report that .
i know my legal obligations , cary .
i have not been in touch with my client .
i will call him and get back to you .
alicia ...
let me call him ,
and i &apos;ll get back to you .
wait . what are you doing ?
we &apos;re not going to know where he is .
i don &apos;t want to know where he is .
alicia ?
i couldn &apos;t reach him .
tread carefully here , alicia ,
because if you know something ,
you &apos;re facing obstruction of justice ,
aiding and abetting ...
i have not spoken to my client .
do you know where he is ?
not for certain .
what do you know for certain ?
i witnessed an audi
with a driver resembling my client
headed westbound on 90 .
he &apos;s going to o &apos;hare .
again , i do not know that for certain .
i thought he was innocent .
i know .
sometimes ...
the guilty ones look like the innocent ones .
well , that &apos;s depressing .
so , what did she tell you ?
i don &apos;t think you should run .
why ?
how ... could you ...
fund @-@ raise for rod blagojevich ?
i know .
it &apos;s dumb , huh ?
yeah .
the voters don &apos;t know you . that &apos;ll define you .
you don &apos;t think you could leak it ,
take the sting away ?
no .
what else , eli ?
isn &apos;t that enough ?
no .
she told you ?
i don &apos;t even know why i care .
the thought that my semen mixed with bin laden &apos;s .
come on , eli , you know how this works .
the semen doesn &apos;t just stay in us .
i thought we were happy in 2007 .
we were .
it was a mistake .
i loved you , vanessa .
we never talked .
we talked .
about work .
about politics .
my mother died , and ...
this was a mistake .
don &apos;t you dare say i wasn &apos;t there for you .
i was there for you .
you were not ! you flew out .
i had to fly out . you said it was fine .
because what could i say ?
that it wasn &apos;t fine .
but you were supposed to know that it wasn &apos;t fine .
how ?
oh , god , it &apos;s like we never left each other .
you know ... thanks .
i just thought
i had done two years of my life well ,
that &apos;s all .
2006 ...
and seven .
you did do it well .
sometimes it &apos;s too late .
one , two , three , four ...
how is she ?
not what i expected .
is that good ?
it is .
so ... i met your son earlier .
i know . he said .
i was lame .
i was babbling .
he didn &apos;t say that .
i was .
so ... do you want me to meet them ?
what ?
no .
i mean , formally .
i know . no .
you sure ?
because i could probably make a good impression .
that &apos;s okay .
thanks .
i mean , really thanks , will .
but it &apos;s not necessary .
okay . good .
good . good .
mr. gardner ?
excuse me .
i &apos;m really sorry about earlier .
for ... ?
nothing .
i &apos;m just figuring things out here .
good .
but why are you sorry ?
i just didn &apos;t mean to come to you first .
alicia said if i had any questions to come to her
and not to bother the partners .
no , you &apos;re not bothering us . don &apos;t worry about it .
are you sure ?
i &apos;m positive .
okay .
thank you .
everybody &apos;s so nice here .
yeah . lawyers .
the nicest people in the world .
oh , come on .
one minute .
where are you putting me now , the parking garage ?
excuse me ?
i won the taiwan case .
the one that you sloughed off on me .
we got chen at the airport , trying to flee .
he &apos;s going away for life .
i &apos;m not moving you .
peter &apos;s moving you .
peter ? where ?
there ?
i guess you kiss enough butts ,
