they say lightning never strikes twice .
but that &apos;s a myth .
and it was so scary ,
seeing derek lying on the floor bleeding like that .
so scary .
it feels good just to , you know , get that out , you know ?
thank you .
thank you .
i feel like i &apos;m ...
ready to go back to work .
it doesn &apos;t happen often .
lightning usually gets it right the first time .
okay , let &apos;s , uh ...
talk more about that tomorrow .
come on .
do you need a @-@ a tissue or ...
a hug or something ?
go hug yourself .
when you &apos;re hit with 30,000 amps of electricity ,
you feel it .
morning .
morning .
it can make you forget who you are .
stay calm . breathe . take some deep breaths .
we &apos;re--we &apos;re just married .
and we &apos;re just gonna get up and go to work like always .
i &apos;ve got this under control . now--
now you need to eat this , a little multigrain ,
and then we &apos;re just gonna go to work .
work is what you need right now , okay ?
we &apos;re gonna get a little blood on those hands .
that &apos;ll feel good . okay ? let &apos;s just get up , get naked ,
get in the shower , have a little morning soapy sex ,
then i &apos;m gonna wash your hair .
i &apos;ve always wanted to wash your hair .
it can burn you , blind you , stop your heart ...
sounds big . i &apos;m betting m.v.c.
multiple m.v.c. or an apartment fire .
when is the staring gonna stop ?
as soon as the novelty wears off . just ignore them .
owen washed my hair .
and he told me to eat this grainy nut bar .
and he booked me into surgery this morning .
he is in charge of me . i &apos;m a bride , and i &apos;m going with it .
but trauma guy didn &apos;t clear you .
yeah ,
but he said he &apos;ll figure that out .
yes . okay , i am the crazy one .
i am the one who freaks out and screams at people ...
like that .
go gawk at each other for a while .
are you okay ?
would everybody please just stop asng if i am okay ? okay ?
and cause massive internal injurie ...
he cleared you , yet ?
no ? still ?
i resorted to tears .
i wore bad mascara so he wouldn &apos;t miss them .
what--what did derek say ?
oh , i will be avoiding him today .
so you don &apos;t have to talk to him about the baby thing ?
no .
oh . because you left him in the pokey .
yeah .
but for something that happens in only a millisecond ...
did you feel different ?
you know , after you scribbled on the post @-@ it ?
i mean , you &apos;re supposed to feel different , right ?
oh , well , it takes time . give it some time .
okay .
i mean , your marriage is filled with secrets and felons .
i mean , why am i asking your advice ?
it can change your life forever .
dr. shepherd , the chief is looking for you .
i know .
you missed the wedding last night .
i know .
you smell pee .
i know .
震撼
how was the wedding ?
it was fine . i &apos;m sorry you missed it .
yeah , well , i was busy getting an incarceration record .
do you know what that means ?
it means you drive too fast . oh , god .
derek , you smell like--
yeah , i know what i smell like .
i have go to the p.i.t.
they cleared you for surgery ?
no , but i can still do consults .
so sorry . bye .
we &apos;re not done talking about this .
oh , god . all right . did a bus crash ?
okay , i &apos;m not saying rip out walls .
i &apos;m saying throw some paint up on &apos; em .
you know , soften it up . yang decorated the place for her ,
and it &apos;s just a little harsh and frowny .
okay . i &apos;m gonna stop you right there ,
&apos;cause yang doesn &apos;t decorate .
i decorated that place . it &apos;s my frowny place .
i meant modern and edgy .
if it &apos;s gonna be our place ,
i just need it to be a little more smiley .
ugh . my god .
i ... frowny ?
edgy .
wh--watch it !
sorry .
karev ?
dr. bailey ?
you still have that bullet in your chest ?
uh , oh , yeah . it worked its way to the surface .
it &apos;s fine . we leave bullets in people all the time .
it must hurt . does it hurt ?
uh , nope .
does it hurt when i do this ?
ow ! damn !
it is not fine .
it is foreign , and it has no business being in your body .
get it out , karev , or i &apos;ll see to it that you won &apos;t operate
until you &apos;re operated on .
andrew perkins hasn &apos;t signed off on her .
you disagree with him ?
no . keeping residents out of the o.r. until they &apos;re ready
is the right approach for most of them ,
but not for cristina .
she won &apos;t feel like herself until she &apos;s back in surgery again .
you know yang .
i do .
and you want to start her on an ex vivo heart reconstruction ?
this is a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime ...
it is a hell of a lot of pressure is what it is .
well , she operated on--
i mean , she saved derek shepherd with a gun to her head .
i don &apos;t think that pressure is the issue for her .
we owe her this , richard , and she needs it .
put her back in the game .
linda cotler , age 51,
has been here three times in the last eight years
for removal of malignant myxomas from her heart .
but we won &apos;t be doing that again .
no , by removing both atria ,
and hopefully all the cancerous cells ,
you won &apos;t have to keep coming back here .
hello , dr. yang . nice to see a familiar face .
finally , someone we know .
mrs. cotler was a patient of dr. burke &apos;s .
you assisted on her last myxoma removal of course .
of course . hi .
you were getting married , weren &apos;t you ?
sorry ?
well , got married . i mean , last night , actually .
you and dr. burke ?
sorry ?
last time we were here ,
he said you two were getting married .
oh , yes .
no . that--that didn &apos;t happen .
what a shame . he went on and on about you .
but you did get married ?
we did , last night . yes , we did .
well , nice to see you again .
well , uh , sit tight ,
and we &apos;ll be back in with some forms for you to sign ,
and then we &apos;ll take you up .
thanks , dr. altman , and congratulations to you two .
thank you .
okay , multiple burn victims .
two with paralysis , three with vision loss ,
one , uh , blown eardrums , and one dislocated hip .
house fire ?
explosion ?
car wreck ?
uh , act of god .
act of god ?
yeah , lightning strike .
all that from one lightning strike ?
one lightning strike , eight victims .
took out a whole flag football team .
god was in a mood today .
how did it strike all of &apos; em ?
well , they &apos;re mostly flash burns ,
so it probably hit one of them
then conducted off onto the rest .
lexie .
t.m. rupture , trauma one .
i &apos;ll see you in there .
tell me something .
when a person gets out of the nut house ..
what &apos;s the appropriate amount of time to wait before you propose ?
what ? long .
longer . long--a long time .
not now .
specifically , how long ?
have you seen my friend kerry ?
she &apos;s--she &apos;s a girl . sh @-@ she &apos;s the only girl .
you &apos;ve just got some ferning here .
it &apos;s superficial . it &apos;s where the electrons entered the skin .
well , what about my arm ? i still can &apos;t feel my arm .
sit forward .
hi .
uh , hi . you changed .
yeah , and showered , twice , thanks to you .
this is russ .
he was struck by lightning while playing flag football ,
and he &apos;s complaining of paralysis in his left arm .
can you move your fingers for me ?
yeah , see , i couldn &apos;t do that when i first got here .
it &apos;s probably just transitory paralysis ,
which is common with lightning strikes .
can you feel that ?
little bit , yeah .
we &apos;re gonna keep watching you ,
but your arm should come back to normal in a couple of hours .
you know they almost revoked my driver &apos;s license ?
can somebody please check on kerry for me ?
happy to . right away .
hey , we &apos;re still not done talking about this .
okay , wiggle your toes for me .
i still can &apos;t . am i gonna be in a wheelchair ?
we &apos;re gonna take you in for a c.t. ,
but hopefully , it is just temporary , from the lightning .
couple of your friends have it , too .
they &apos;re already starting to get some feeling back .
okay .
try not to worry .
hey , kerry . a friend of yours , russ gammie ,
is asking about you .
how &apos;s warren griffith ?
is he okay ? did he ask about me ?
which one is warren ?
excuse me . excuse me . i--
who &apos;s this , russ or warren ?
mitch ?
mitch now ?
hey , have you seen warren ? is he okay ?
kerry , i gotta say this .
we both could &apos;ve died out there .
that lightning bolt was like a one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ million shot ,
so i gotta take one , too .
i love you , kerry ,
and if we get through this ,
i want you to know ,
i will love you forever .
what ?
sir , i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re not being treated ,
then you &apos;re gonna have to go to the waiting room .
we &apos;ll--we &apos;ll keep you posted .
kerry , can you hear me ?
yeah , i can hear you fine .
i just didn &apos;t want him to know that i heard that .
you &apos;re a popular girl .
no . i &apos;m sure he &apos;s just overexcited .
it is like a one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ million thing .
actually , it &apos;s more like
a 1 @-@ in @-@ 6,250 kind of thing .
lightning kills between 150 to 300 people
every year in the u.s. alone .
lexie .
well , no , i mean , it &apos;s-- it &apos;s still rare .
i mean , it &apos;s not , like , say , handgun death .
i mean , that &apos;s--that &apos;s 1 in 325 .
lexie . you okay ?
yeah . no , i &apos;m saying-- i &apos;m saying she &apos;s lucky .
that &apos;s ... you know , hey , yay , you .
can someone just please check on warren for me ?
i need to know if he &apos;s okay .
is warren your boyfriend ?
no . he &apos;s ...
no .
okay .
well , you &apos;ve got two burst ear drums ,
but they will heal themselves , too .
great . thank you .
does that mean there &apos;s no surgery ? can i go ?
&apos;cause dr. shepherd &apos;s here , so he might have something .
maybe you should stick with me .
kerry will need a workup .
i &apos;m sorry . why is this
better than what dr. burke did ?
dr. burke &apos;s approach was conservative and correct
for the first few surgeries .
this is radical and risky , but--
well , it sounds like it &apos;s gonna kill her .
linda &apos;s heart wall has grown weaker with every surgery ,
so there are greater odds of cardiac rupture .
this may be her last chance .
paul ... honey , every two years ,
we come here , they cut me open ,
and i watch it take ten years off of your life .
i can &apos;t do it anymore .
and neither can you .
what about you ?
do you think this is the best idea ?
oh , i &apos;m not , um--
because what you and dr. burke did ,
it &apos;s kept her with me so far .
if this was your husband , would you let dr. altman
tear apart his heart ?
yes .
an aggressive approach is your only option .
this is what you want .
okay .
all right .
okay .
we &apos;ll see you in there .
what are these ?
choices .
they &apos;re all beige .
no , they &apos;re all subtle .
look , pastels and earth tones .
if you look closely , that &apos;s blue ,
that &apos;s green , that &apos;s yellow--
to take the edge off all the chrome and concrete .
what do you think ?
i think i don &apos;t want to live in an easter basket .
i know . you really want to live in the batcave .
but meet me halfway .
uh , yes . schultz , kerry ? yes , thank you .
okay , uh , my patient &apos;s scans are up .
and , uh , seriously ...
they &apos;re all beige to me .
w @-@ well , then it shouldn &apos;t be hard to pick one .
i &apos;m looking for warren griffith .
that &apos;s me .
i feel kind of queasy .
you &apos;ve got a little fever . that may be why .
you got hit the hardest .
looks like it went into your neck and came out your foot .
and you &apos;re saying it bounced off me and hit everyone else ?
i took out the whole team ?
it &apos;s not like it &apos;s your fault .
it kinda feels that way . i don &apos;t remember any of it .
how about my friend kerry ? is she okay ?
she &apos;s wondering the same thing about you .
she what ? she asked about me ?
specifically ?
well , what did she say ?
are you people in junior high ?
i almost told her . i tried to . i ...
i &apos;m gonna tell her .
what are you talking about ?
kerry . i tried to tell her i @-@ i love her , but her--
her ears are all messed up and
you gotta sit down .
where are you going ?
i gotta tell her . i get to tell her .
g @-@ guys , look ,
leave her alone . all right ? she coulda died out there .
and besides , she &apos;s , like , mine .
no , i &apos;ven working up to this for a year .
no , no , no , you &apos;ve gotta sit .
she &apos;s mine , and i love her .
i &apos;ve been working up to this for a year .
you need to come back here and sit down !
popular girl .
oh , my god . thank you .
yep , c.t. looks clear . no damage to your spine .
which means i can go ?
it means you should observe her .
guys , you can &apos;t be in here .
everybody , shut up . shut up .
okay , warren . you talk .
kerry , i ...
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god !
page bailey !
warren , you have a perforation--
a hole-- somewhere in your bowel .
we &apos;re gonna have to take you up to surgery .
tell kerry i &apos;m sorry .
tell her i &apos;m sorry i hit her with lightning .
hey , don &apos;t you worry .
no , she &apos;s just the sweetest , funniest--she &apos;s just--
just please make sure she &apos;s okay .
okay . we will .
we &apos;re gonna take care of you now .
all right , who do i have ? who &apos;s free ?
i &apos;m free . i &apos;m good . i &apos;ll go .
he &apos;s my patient . i &apos;ll take him .
book an o.r. you can observe .
i &apos;m fine , and i &apos;m free .
b--what are you doing ?
nothing .
other grey , are you free to scrub in ?
absolutely .
i-- i &apos;m available ,
&apos;cause you haven &apos;t been cleared for surgery , right ?
april , if we &apos;re gonna be friends ...
you have to stop doing that .
sorry . habit .
i &apos;m standing right here .
kepner , go prep him .
okay . i &apos;ll see you up there .
i &apos;m fine .
well , great . then you can keep an eye on kerry .
i &apos;ll resect both atria ...
and build new ones out of bovine pericardium .
and during reconstruction ,
dr. hunt will stay with linda , using a human donor aorta
to prepare the vessels for reimplantation .
and all of this in just four hours ?
we have to be fast . we all set ?
let &apos;s go .
all right . prep her and page me when she &apos;s ready
sure .
cristina .
are you excited ?
yes , absolutely .
good . good .
the fear of going back in is worse than actually doing it .
it &apos;s just getting back on the horse is all it is .
this is one hell of a honeymoon , right ?
incision looks great .
hey , i hear you and torres are shacking up .
uh , uh , yeah .
do i sound more excited than you ?
no , no . i am . i am .
how &apos;s it going with the hot , hot trauma counselor ?
i have to say ...
it &apos;s great .
the conversation never stops ,
and i feel , um ...
i don &apos;t know . i feel good whenever i see him .
no heart murmur . good girl .
what do you talk about ? what &apos;s he like ?
he &apos;s , um ... well , he likes to , uh ...
i guess i @-@ i mostly talk ,
and he mostly listens .
he &apos;s--he &apos;s an amazingly good listener .
well , he should be . it &apos;s what he gets paid for .
warren ?
you love warren ?
warren &apos;s bald , kerry .
i know that , mitch .
you guys don &apos;t love me .
i &apos;m a girl who &apos;s down with flag football ,
so you think you love me .
plus , we got struck by lightning ,
so that &apos;s ...
nice . you made her cry .
oh , crap . you know , sorry .
you know , warren &apos;s a good guy .
he could probably get a hairpiece or something and--
she &apos;s crying because everything &apos;s changed .
okay ? lightning struck , and everything changed .
you were her team .
she was one of you , and--and now you &apos;re just--
you &apos;re looking at her differently .
um , n @-@ no .
i &apos;m crying because i &apos;m worried about warren .
could you please find out if he &apos;s okay ?
really ?
this is what i &apos;m cleared to do .
i &apos;m cleared to solve this puzzle .
don &apos;t buy a vowel , you idiot .
scarlet pimpernel .
how did you--
there was one &quot; c &quot; and an &quot; m . &quot;
have you talked to derek yet about the--
today &apos;s not the day .
right . he just got out of the joint .
let him ease back into society .
you ready ?
you up for this ?
up for what ?
teddy &apos;s rebuilding a woman &apos;s atrium out of a sack of cow meat .
but you &apos;re not nervous at all ?
you &apos;re lucky . i get to watch an intestinal perf repair .
bailey won &apos;t let me operate till i get this bullet out .
i &apos;ll take it out .
i &apos;ll cut it out right now .
you sound like a junkie .
what the hell is a pimpernel ?
kerry wants to know how warren &apos;s doing ?
intestinal perf . going to surgery .
i &apos;m never gonna operate again .
everyone thinks i &apos;m gonna carve my initials into a patient .
i &apos;ll never operate again because one man thinks i &apos;m crazy .
hey , guys , look at this . look at this .
a bystander &apos;s cell phone captured the shocking end
to a flag football practice in lawton park this morning .
oh ! oh ! oh , my--
we &apos;ve got that amazing footage ,
plus all your news traffic and weather , coming up after this .
oh , my god . she never saw it coming .
no . no . no , no , no .
$ 50 says she back in the cuckoo &apos;s nest by lunch .
hey , how was your night in jail ?
you shank someone right off the bat ?
you gotta let the other cons know not to mess with you .
that &apos;s not funny .
they almost charged me with reckless endangerment .
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
you mean that &apos;s where you &apos;ve been all morning .
in jail for reckless endangerment ?
nobody was endangered .
i can &apos;t have this , derek . i won &apos;t . now--
have you ever been over 120 miles an hour before ?
richard , have you ever been over 80 ? it &apos;s fun .
it &apos;s really fun . i mean , especially when you go
through a corner like that at that speed , and--
and you &apos;re not sure if the rear end &apos;s gonna stick or not ,
and you lose control , and then you put the throttle down ,
and the car corrects a little bit ,
and you take it to the limit and you don &apos;t lose control ,
you just grab it . have you ever done it ?
uh , uh , no , derek , no .
you want to ? i &apos;ll take you .
you should . it &apos;s ... really great .
let &apos;s go right now . let &apos;s do it . come on .
i &apos;d like that .
yeah ? right ? good . we &apos;re going . oh .
you need to help me . i need your help . hey .
what ? okay .
she &apos;s paralyzed , and it &apos;s not gonna go away .
she &apos;s not gonna get any better .
lexie , hold on . you &apos;re all right .
no , n @-@ not me . it &apos;s kerry schultz .
she got hit outta nowhere ,
and it &apos;s not gonna get any better .
i need you to listen to me .
look , this has nothing to do with that . she &apos;s--
no , just shut up and please listen to me .
make sure she &apos;s all right .
i &apos;m trying .
120 miles an hour .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re back ,
that we &apos;re gonna be in there together .
it makes me a little less freaked out is what i &apos;m saying .
is this gonna become a thing--
you sharing all your sad , scared feelings
because we almost got shot together ?
there it is .
now i know you &apos;re back .
this boy got it bad . okay , throw a stitch in there .
suction .
staph infection , which causes cellulitis ,
an abscess , possibly mrsa ,
which could lead to sepsis and death .
uh , i &apos;m sorry . where are you seeing all of this ?
in dr. karev &apos;s chest .
if he doesn &apos;t have that bullet removed .
i &apos;ll cross that bridge when i come to it .
can i leave now ?
no , you can stand right there
to make sure you don &apos;t get into anyone else &apos;s o.r. ,
not until you &apos;re lead @-@ free .
all right .
the heart is ready .
okay . here we go .
start the clock . dr. yang ...
take the heart , please .
badass .
all right . here we go .
excising the right atrium .
welcome back , dr. yang .
thank you .
see ?
you went down before the lightning even struck .
oh , my god . warren . i never even saw him coming .
is he okay ?
he &apos;s in surgery now .
kerry , your new scan shows an epidural hematoma .
it &apos;s blood in your spine that &apos;s compressing your spinal cord .
we didn &apos;t see that before ?
probably too small to see ,
and it &apos;s been bleeding for hours .
it &apos;s an easy procedure to relieve the pressure .
and i &apos;ll walk again ?
you &apos;ll be out on the field in no time . book an o.r.
i &apos;ll see you in there .
f @-@ for an actual surgery ?
yes .
thank you .
oh , so stupid .
all this time ... i never told him .
and i @-@ i had all these reasons , you know ?
and ... they seemed like good reasons
until we all almost died .
i was worried about , what , about shaking up the team ?
it &apos;s flag football . we play once a week .
god , i &apos;m an idiot .
i thought you were in surgery .
yeah , the guy pulled through .
is lexie okay ?
why don &apos;t you ask her yourself ?
she doesn &apos;t need me talking to her .
well , you &apos;re the one who ended it .
yeah , it ended the way it always ends .
i get close to the chick , the chick goes crazy .
rebecca and izzie , my mom--
i &apos;m a lightning rod for this crap .
you &apos;re not that special .
lexie &apos;s not crazy .
she had a crazy thing happen to her ,
and her reaction was pretty normal .
and izzie had brain cancer .
rebecca--she was crazy ,
but that was the facial reconstruction trauma .
you &apos;re not a lightning rod , alex .
you &apos;re just a guy who &apos;s been through a lot of crap .
i wish i had a scalpel right now .
junkie .
time , please .
2 hours and 42 minutes .
we &apos;re behind . dr. hunt , where are you at ?

run . go .
look , i &apos;ll just go . i got it .
the dura is pulsatile .
good catch , dr . grey .
thank you , and , um , thank you for listening to me
and for not being afraid of me .
nobody &apos;s afraid of you .
mark &apos;s keeping me chained to his service .
he &apos;s keeping me out of surgeries .
because he &apos;s afraid for you . so he hovers .
other people might lock you in a cell overnight
to be urinated on by a meth head .
but it all comes from the same place .
oh , you--you @-@ you can &apos;t be in here .
but we &apos;re friends now , so i &apos;ll just shut up .
good girl .
dr. grey , you shouldn &apos;t be in the o.r.
cristina .
cristina .
i can &apos;t be in here .
i can &apos;t .
okay , so let &apos;s go . let &apos;s get out of here .
i can &apos;t--i c-- i can &apos;t feel anything .
i know .
i know .
come with me .
no , no . i ... i can &apos;t move .
i can &apos;t move my legs .
i can &apos;t-- i can &apos;t feel anything .
f @-@ f @-@ feel my hand . take my hand .
do you feel that ?
okay .
you &apos;re okay .
we &apos;re gonna go when you &apos;re ready .
okay ?
yeah . yeah , yeah .
so you tell me when you &apos;re ready , okay ?
okay . okay .
is it over ?
how is she ?
oh , i &apos;m-- i &apos;m sorry .
no , no . no , no-- i @-@ i--she &apos;s fine . uh , the doctors are still working ,
and someone will be out when they &apos;re finished .
you &apos;re wrong .
sorry ?
there &apos;s no time to wait .
people get struck by lightning .
people die .
my best friend got shot , torres .
why are you telling me to give it time
when there &apos;s no guarantee that time is gonna be there ?
i &apos;m ... not gonna wait around to be happy anymore .
all right . listen , this is something that you and i do .
we skip steps .
okay , i pushed arizona to have a baby ,
and i almost lost her .
because i skipped a bunch of steps .
but then i went back , and now she &apos;s moving in ...
and ruining my apartment .
look , i &apos;m saying , proposing might be too much ,
especially if she &apos;s not herself right now .
i know who she is , and if
she &apos;s going through her worst right now ,
i wanna go through it with her .
she makes me happier than ...
anything i &apos;ve ever known .
and if i can have a part in--in making her happy again ,
that &apos;s all i want to do .
that &apos;s all i want to do for the rest of my life .

and that idiot is clearing everyone for surgery
like they &apos;re fine , and they &apos;re not fine .
stop . stop . i need to talk to you .
just leave it alone , derek .
it was one night in jail .
you drive too fast . just forget about it .
i don &apos;t want to talk about that . don &apos;t worry about that .
don &apos;t worry about it ? all i do is worry all the time .
i spend every minute of every day worrying
that i &apos;m gonna get a phone call
that you &apos;ve wrapped your car around a pole .
that &apos;s why i left you jail ,
so that just for a little while ,
i would know that you weren &apos;t dying
like you were dying on that table .
that &apos;s what i think about
every time you pull out of the driveway .
i &apos;m right here . i &apos;m okay .
we &apos;re okay .
i was pregnant ... that day .
i was pregnant , and i lost it .
i , uh ...
you didn &apos;t say anything .
i coulda helped you .
if you want to help me ,
you are driving something you can control .
just do that . just do that .
okay . okay .
what happened in the o.r. , we couldn &apos;t have seen that .
i @-@ i can &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t do it .
you said i could do it .
i know . i know . i ... i thought you were ready .
you &apos;ve never not been ready .
cristina , i know what you &apos;re feeling .
i don &apos;t feel anything .
i can &apos;t be in there .
and if i can &apos;t be in there ,
i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m supposed to be .
you &apos;re supposed to be here . you &apos;re my wife .
you can just be here .
i &apos;m sorry .
you up for a visitor ?
kerry ?
oh , my god . warren ?
are you okay ?
um , they--they told me
that i slammed you really hard on the field and--
oh , it &apos;s okay .
accidents happen . it &apos;s--it &apos;s football .
i &apos;m fine .
well , they also told me that i ...
i got you all struck by lightning .
that &apos;s-- i--
that &apos;s--
i just--i wanted to say , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m not .
i love you .
i &apos;ve been in love with you forever .
dr. grey , can you please push me a @-@ a little closer ?
lightning doesn &apos;t often strike twice .
it &apos;s a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime thing .
even if it feels like the shock is coming over and over again ...
you paged me ?
i did . i have a surgery .
you &apos;re actually gonna let me near a patient ?
you are the patient .
get in there and get on that table .
i don &apos;t need a reminder of this thing .
i &apos;m gonna carry that day around with me
every day for the rest of my life whether i want to not .
now they &apos;ve plastered over every bullet hole in this building .
i don &apos;t need a reminder every time i look at you .
and i &apos;m tired of bullying you ,
so i am asking you ,
please , get in there and get your shirt off .
yes , ma &apos;am .
eventually ...
the pain will go away ,
the shock will wear off ...
oh , hey . you ready to go ?
i , uh , i pushed our reservation .
do i talk too much ?
i &apos;m enjoying you and--and this .
and i feel good when i &apos;m with you ,
but ... it occurs to me , well , that &apos;s your job--
i mean , to come in here and to listen to people talk
and to make them feel good , and i just--
i want to be sure that i &apos;m not using you for that , you know ,
and that i &apos;m not doing all the talking
and the--and the good feeling
and that i &apos;m--i &apos;m--i &apos;m not treating you like a--like a--
well , like a ... like a shrink .
&apos;cause i &apos;m enjoying this .
now you talk .
well ...
listening to you is not work .
i &apos;m happy to talk ,
but i have listened a lot today .
i talked a lot , too .
and so for now , i &apos;d like to say ...
i &apos;m enjoying this , too .
and , uh ... maybe we can both not tall for a while ?
okay .
yeah .
and you start to heal yourself ...
did you know that webber went over my head
and cleared yang for your o.r. ?
we-- we really don &apos;t have to--to talk .
come here . yeah ?
yeah .
lexie .
did i forget to clean something ?
no . i just need to talk to you .
no ... you don &apos;t , though .
i know that you want to be here ,
but you don &apos;t have to .
w @-@ wait .
i went through a rough patch , and you helped me ,
and i appreciate that .
but i am moving out of it , and you won &apos;t let me .
you know , you &apos;re treating me like i am a basket case .
and--and--and everyone is watching you ,
and they &apos;re believing you .
i had a good day today .
i saved a girl today . i did that .
i am a good doctor , and i don &apos;t deserve for people
to think that i am anything less than that .
so could you please just leave me alone ?
can you do that ? can you just leave me alone ?
you got it .
to recover from something you never saw coming .
charles was a good guy .
he was funny .
reed ... well , she was kind of messed up ,
but she wasn &apos;t a bad person .
i just don &apos;t--
i don &apos;t know why ...
i shouldn &apos;t just get to walk away , you know ?
i don &apos;t know why we made it either .
we just have to find a way to be grateful .
son of a bitch .
agreed .
paint it beige .
you got a girl ...
you love who loves you back .
paint it whatever stupid color she wants .
but sometimes , the odds are in your favor .
50 % of marriages end in divorce ,
so between the two of us ,
you and mcdreamy should be fine .
i thought it would fix me .
that &apos;s not why he married you .
well , he didn &apos;t marry me . he married a corpse .
i &apos;m dead inside .
i told derek .
about the miscarriage , i told him .
you got married , cristina ,
for better or for worse .
this is the worse part .
the thing is , there will be better parts .
you should go back .
yeah ?
yeah .
cristina ...
you don &apos;t feel nothing .
all right ?
you didn &apos;t feel nothing today .
you felt scared . you were terrified .
and you felt anger . you were angry at me .
and after what you &apos;ve been through ,
you &apos;re allowed , all right ?
that &apos;s what you should be feeling . i know .
because when i was there , i felt all those things ,
and i ... i took it all out on you .
and you were patient , and you were kind ,
and you stayed through it all because you love me .
you love me .
so , uh ...
you can be scared with me ,
or you can be pissed with me or at me .
i don &apos;t care , &apos; cause i &apos;m gonna stay through it all .
i &apos;m not going anywhere , cristina .
i &apos;m not going anywhere without you .
let &apos;s go home .
i had already fixed her before you came ,
but ... that was a nice speech .
if you &apos;re in just the right place
at just the right time ...
you can take a hell of a hit ...
i lost a baby ,
i almost lost my husband ,
and my best friend may never recover .
so i don &apos;t care what you do . clear me or don &apos;t clear me .
i have no control over any of it .
i &apos;m giving up .
well ...
that sounds like a good plan .
you &apos;re cleared for surgery , dr. grey .
