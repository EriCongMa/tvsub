desperate housewives s07 e13
keith moved in with bree .
susan came to grips with her future .
dialysis until they find me a donor .
well , that won &apos;t take very long , will it ?
three to five years .
in grief over losing her biological daughter ...
grace no longer exists , and that is the last time
you will mention her name in this house !
gaby sought comfort from an unusual source .
and there were some surprises ...
somebody lose a gun ?
including a long lost son ...
you didn &apos;t mention your mother @-@ in @-@ law .
my mother @-@ in @-@ law ?
and a shocking revelation for paul .
felicia tillman has gone to some extraordinary lengths
to cause you harm .
paul young had made a discovery--
his wife was a liar .
she had lied with every smile ,
with every caress ,
and with every kiss .
yes , paul now knew their entire marriage was a fraud .
the only thing he didn &apos;t know ...
hey there .
was how he would punish her .
you &apos;re packing ?
i thought you weren &apos;t coming home until tomorrow .
i talked the doctor into letting me out early .
i &apos;m glad . i really need you right now .
things on the street have been getting very strange .
beth , things on that street have always been very strange .
well , yes , but ...
remember i told you how bree was inviting me over
for drinks with the other women ?
and i told you not to go .
well , i should &apos;ve listened .
turns out they &apos;re trying to frame me .
frame you ?
while i was there ,
i found a gun under my sofa cushion .
it was a .38--
the same caliber the police said you were shot with .
they must &apos;ve planted it there .
and the gun just magically appeared ?
yes .
i &apos;m sure bree &apos;s going to turn it over to the police ,
and they &apos;re going to think i shot you .
beth ...
you don &apos;t have to worry about what anyone else thinks .
i know the truth .
hey , here &apos;s an idea .
why don &apos;t we take a trip ?
a trip ?
we need to get away .
we &apos;ll go somewhere ... secluded .
that sounds like heaven .
yes ...
paul had no choice but to punish his wife ...
i love you .
because some lies ...
are unforgiveable .
we are reminded every spring ...
with every rose that blooms ,
with every sunflower that blossoms ,
with every lily that buds .
the world is a beautiful place .
sadly , it is filled with people who do ugly things ...
constantly .
that woman who just drove away--who was she ?
uh ... a friend .
you &apos;re friends with barbara fairchild ,
the interior designer ?
bob ?
or should i say , the inferior designer ?
hey , renee .
how could you hire barbara fairchild
when you know i just started my own interior design firm ?
uh ... we &apos;re not hiring her .
oh ? why you holding swatches ?
and people think you &apos;re the smart one .
look , you know we just adopted a little girl .
well , we hired barbara to decorate her room .
well , why not hire me ?
you &apos;re not exactly maternal .
we--we wanted this room to be pink and nurturing ,
and your style seems more like chrome and glass and ...
teeth .
look who &apos;s back to being the smart one .
look , fairchild is a hack . whatever she quoted you ,
i &apos;ll come in 2 days earlier and 20 % cheaper .
barbara is kind of expensive .
done .
i &apos;ll get started right away .
just so you know ,
our daughter gets here in a week .
and just so you know ,
i &apos;m as maternal as the next woman .
gaby ?
hi , honey . you want some lunch ?
no , i want an explanation .
i just got our credit card bill .
$ 840 at miss charlotte &apos;s doll academy ?
did i say lunch ?
i meant sex . do you want some sex ?
why are you buying our kids fancy toys ?
last week , juanita used her doll &apos;s leg
to scrape peanut butter out of the jar .
okay , the doll wasn &apos;t for juanita .
it &apos;s for ...
bob and lee , for the little girl they &apos;re adopting .
you spent $ 800 on a gift ?
it made me feel good , okay ? for the first time in weeks ,
i &apos;m not staying in bed till 2 : 00 in the afternoon
or staying up all night sobbing .
so i went a little crazy on the credit card .
just let me be happy .
but $ 800 ? !
carlos , if you get this worked up now ,
you &apos;ll have no place to go
when the bill for the platinum card comes in .
uh , excuse me ? hi .
i &apos;m looking for keith watson .
his roommate told me he moved here .
uh , yes , but he &apos;s not available at the moment .
can i give him a message , miss ...
sorry . i &apos;m amber james .
i just need to talk to him about something .
it &apos;s kind of important .
well , i would be happy to tell him what it &apos;s regarding
if you ... tell me ... what it &apos;s regarding .
we &apos;re just ... old friends .
i &apos;m at the fairview motor inn .
could you ask him to come by ?
why exactly would he be doing that ?
you &apos;re ... kind of a nosy landlady , aren &apos;t you ?
i &apos;m not his landlady . i &apos;m his girlfriend .
so he ...
lives here with you ?
yes .
yeah , of-- of course he does .
of course he does .
are you all right ?
um , yeah , i &apos;m fine .
you know what ? don &apos;t even , uh , don &apos;t even tell him i came by .
there &apos;s no message . sorry to disturb you .
okay , you &apos;re all set .
the dialysis will take six hours .
if you need anything , just hit the call button .
will do .
hi .
hi .
i &apos;m susan .
it &apos;s my first time in here .
dick .
sounds like you &apos;ve been coming here for a while .
four years .
any tips for a newbie ?
like , which nurse has the shakes
or where do they hide the good painkillers ?
look , nothing personal ,
but i don &apos;t want to be your dialysis buddy .
i wanna sit here and play scrabble on my phone
while this--while this machine washes my blood .
so you don &apos;t want to talk or be friendly
or keep each other company ?
sad , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , dick ...
sometimes when i meet people , they say ,
&quot; you don &apos;t seem like a susan . &quot;
but you ...
why are you putting out those ugly candlesticks ?
oh . who gave them to me ?
yay ! grandma &apos;s coming .
yep , and your brother just pulled up with her .
this could be your last chance
to run screaming from the room .
why ? i love grandma .
i do , too , sweetie . it &apos;s just ...
i can only take her in small doses ,
and unfortunately , your grandma doesn &apos;t come in small doses .
hey !
easy over the threshold ! you &apos;re not transporting meat .
okay , grandma , enjoy your visit .
she &apos;s going back in a cab .
mom ! hi !
oh , my gosh ! what happened to your foot ?
oh , i @-@ i broke it a month ago . uh , thanks for checking in .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . we &apos;ve just been so busy , and ...
penny , look , your grandma &apos;s here .
give her a kiss .
hey , look at you . you &apos;re getting buds !
be thankful she didn &apos;t yell it to you
as you were getting on the bus .
so ... uh , what &apos;s new ?
well ... actually , um , i started an interior design business .
do you remember my friend renee ?
i &apos;m getting married .
what ? married ?
to who ?
frank kaminski .
we met in water aerobics at the retirement community .
only man in the pool . i was lucky to get him .
this is kind of a shock .
i didn &apos;t even know you were dating .
so ... when &apos;s the wedding ?
saturday .
this saturday ?
uh , and you &apos;re just telling me now ?
well , maybe if you visited
more often ...
more often . i know .
i know . so ...
do i get to meet him ?
i mean , if you &apos;re going to make this kind of commitment ...
what ? you wanna make sure his intentions are honorable ?
lynette , i hate to break this to you .
i am not a virgin .
mom ... i want to meet him .
all right , come by tomorrow , and we &apos;ll squeeze you in
between &quot; nothing to do &quot; and &quot; waiting for death . &quot;
are you all right ?
what ?
you were yelling in your sleep .
really ?
yes , you were shouting out , &quot; amber ! amber ! &quot;
what could that mean ?
i &apos;m ... i &apos;m doing a painting job .
i &apos;m thinking about , uh ...
shades of yellow that go in the kitchen .
nope . definitely not a color .
sounded like a name--amber .
know anyone by that name ?
i once had a girlfriend named amber .
did you ?
and at this time i &apos;d like to point out
that dreaming of an old girlfriend
is not cheating .
well ... when was this ?
you never told me about her .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know . seven years ago ?
seven years ?
was it serious ?
we lived together ...
for , uh , three years .
so you were in love with her .
well ... yeah ,
until she left me .
so she left you .
you miss her ?
i tend to not dwell on people who stomped on my heart .
now if you don &apos;t mind , i &apos;m gonna go back to sleep
so i can dream about you .
it &apos;s so great visiting a retirement village--
2 regular parking spaces , 48 handicapped .
hey , mom . mwah .
lynette ...
this is frank .
it is so nice to meet you , frank .
call me &quot; dad . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be awful if i was that guy ?
so ... frank , um , i &apos;ve just been dying to meet you , and--
just a sec . hey , muchacho .
we &apos;ve been waiting ten minutes for our menu .
what do i got to do to get you to hurry it over , build a fence ?
hey , it &apos;s a menu , not a high school diploma .
i &apos;m sure you can find one somewhere .
oh , yeah . you were saying something ?
lynette &apos;s been dying to meet you .
she has so many questions .
oh , go ahead . i got time to kill while i &apos;m waiting
for pancho villa to get my menu .
okay . uh ... i was just wondering ,
what made you decide to propose to my mother ?
i love her . what do you think ?
aw . what a short ... angry story .
frank ... is very to the point .
that &apos;s what first attracted me to him .
oh .
what else you need to know ?
um , have you ever been married before ?
three times--two dead and two left me .
oh , wait a minute . that &apos;s four . yeah , then make it four .
now ... you done grilling me ?
yes . i think i &apos;ve learned everything i need to know .
hi , gaby .
hey , karen .
i wanted to get the name of that chinese place
you and roy are always raving about .
come on in . i &apos;ll get you the address .
carlos is a little grumpy
since the credit card bills came in .
i figured a little m.s.g. should calm him down .
i &apos;ve got a menu here somewhere .
i never noticed that before .
what ?
that doll .
oh , adelaide . heck , i &apos;ve had her since forever .
she was my best friend growing up .
i couldn &apos;t bear to toss her , so there she is .
i didn &apos;t know you were into dolls .
i &apos;m not really into them .
oh ! here &apos;s the menu .
where did , uh , that come from ?
i carry her around with me .
you do ?
mm @-@ hmm . her name &apos;s princess valerie .
oh ! look ! they could be sisters .
okay .
oh , i have an idea .
miss charlotte &apos;s doll academy ,
where i got valerie , has this tearoom .
it is beautiful . all of us should go sometime .
by all of us , you mean the dolls ?
of course . should i make a reservation ?
well ... maybe .
i &apos;m kinda curious to see where this all goes .
here .
thanks .
oh , no !
what &apos;s wrong ?
i said &quot; no mayo , &quot; like , 15 times .
i &apos;ll trade with you . do you want my salad ?
uh , let me check . nope , still got a penis .
i want my hamburger the way i ordered it .
i &apos;ll get you a new one .
i got tee time in ten minutes .
so go !
it &apos;ll be waiting for you at the condo , wrapped in foil ,
with an ice cold beer when you get there .
you &apos;re-- you &apos;re so good to me .
see you at the wedding , lorraine .
so what do you think ?
well , he &apos;s quite a ...
i wouldn &apos;t even know where to ... okay , he &apos;s gone .
how can you marry that jerk ?
lynette !
i mean it . he &apos;s abrasive ,
obnoxious , borderline racist--
no , he crossed the border of racist .
he lives in racist .
you cannot seriously love him .
i don &apos;t .
you ... you don &apos;t ?
then why are you marrying him ?
because he &apos;s loaded ,
and he hates his kids , and he &apos;s got a bad ticker .
and when he kicks the bucket , i get everything .
you &apos;re marrying him for his money ?
please . i married for love three times
and ended up brokenhearted and piss @-@ poor .
and by the way ,
he &apos;s getting something out of this , too .
you wanna know how i really broke my foot ?
paul ?
what are you doing up ? is everything all right ?
couldn &apos;t sleep .
i &apos;ve just been ... sitting here , thinking .
about what ?
i have so much hatred inside me ...
from my neighbors who betrayed me ...
for my son who disowned me .
for whoever tried to kill me .
i &apos;m tired of hating people ,
but i don &apos;t know how to stop .
what a thing to say .
stop being so hard on yourself .
you &apos;re a decent man .
you just need to focus on what &apos;s good in your life .
what is that again ?
well , for starters , me .
i do think about you ... all the time .
from the first moment i met you ,
all i wanted was for you to love me .
and ... here we are .
here we are .
you &apos;re just tired .
come back to bed .
all right .
tomorrow we can talk about our trip .
we need to decide where we &apos;re going .
yes , about that ...
i booked us a cabin in the woods .
cabin ? oh , that sounds ... rustic .
i need to go somewhere far away
where nobody can find us .
okay .
you can be happy , paul .
you just need to identify what &apos;s negative in your life ...
and then get rid of it .
that sounds like a plan .
hey , karen . gaby &apos;s in the kitchen .
actually , i wanna talk to you about gaby .
how &apos;s she doing lately ?
well , you know , we went through kind of a rough patch ,
but i think she &apos;s coming around now .
yeah ? well , think again .
girls , dinner &apos;s ready ! i made your favorite ...
what are you doing here ?
gaby .
jeez ! you scared me .
this wasn &apos;t a gift for bob and lee , was it ?
why &apos;d you lie to me ?
because i knew you wouldn &apos;t understand .
you spent $ 800 on a doll for yourself .
y @-@ you &apos;re right . i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
oh , please .
like this is any crazier than your collections .
a steroid freak hits a baseball over a fence ,
and you paid thousands of dollars for it .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t carry it around with me
or take it to tea .
okay , first of all ,
mrs. mccluskey has a big mouth .
second , the doll makes me happy .
what do you care ?
gaby , i want you to be happy ,
but this is not about a doll .
you know what ? i don &apos;t want to talk about this anymore .
this is clearly about grace .
no ! no ! no !
we &apos;re not supposed to talk about her !
that was your rule !
i &apos;m going to get ready for dinner .
hey , susan .
i kept her warm for ya .
thanks , ethan . hey , how was your history final ?
aced it . thank you for studying with me .
no problem . i &apos;ll see you thursday .
yeah .
scrabble .
look , i know you don &apos;t wanna talk ,
but i thought it would be more fun to play with me
than with your phone .
thanks , but i &apos;ll take the phone .
you know , this whole experience
is miserable and isolating enough .
i don &apos;t understand why you wanna make it worse
by ignoring someone who &apos;s going
through the same ordeal .
susan , did you ever see the old war movie
where the fresh young kid comes in all bright @-@ eyed ,
and the old vet won &apos;t give him the time of day ?
i hate war movies .
okay .
what about the one
where the girl moves to a different town ,
and the mean cheerleader at her new school
doesn &apos;t wanna hang out with her ?
go on .
i &apos;m the mean cheerleader . okay ?
and i &apos;m letting you know we &apos;re not going to be friends .
you know , i can see why you &apos;re frustrated .
waiting for a transplant is brutal .
i @-@ i get that .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that you can &apos;t try to stay positive
while you wait for the good news .
the good news ?
when this beeper goes off , that means someone died .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re waiting for--
for some poor son of a bitch
who didn &apos;t use a helmet or a seat belt to die .
we &apos;re waiting for a doctor to ask a family
who , moments earlier , lost someone they loved
to let them harvest their organs .
and then we &apos;re waiting to see who gets them .
that &apos;s what we do . we wait for tragedy
and then cross our fingers that it &apos;s us
they wake up at 2 : 00 in the morning
with the good news .
susan ...
i know your intentions are good ,
but you don &apos;t have to distract me
or entertain me or comfort me .
i wasn &apos;t trying to comfort ... you .
hi , amber .
what are you doing here ?
well , you seemed so upset when you came over ,
and obviously it involves keith ,
or you wouldn &apos;t have come looking for him ,
and so naturally i &apos;m concerned .
everything &apos;s fine . it &apos;s not a big deal .
anyway , i &apos;m ...
sort of in the middle of packing , so ...
mommy , i can &apos;t find my ball .
charlie , i &apos;ll be with you in a second , okay ?
how old is charlie ?
6 .
keith and i would be great for a while
and then not so great .
i had actually moved out
before i realized i was pregnant .
so why didn &apos;t you tell keith ?
i had actually decided to give up the baby ,
and i knew he would try and talk me out of it .
then i changed my mind the moment i saw charlie .
after that , it just never felt right to come back
and ambush him with a kid .
and yet ... here you are , ambushing .
it &apos;s just ... charlie is at that age
where he &apos;s starting to ask a lot of questions ,
and i &apos;m running out of ways to be vague .
so charlie is the only reason you came ?
okay .
maybe i ... was kind of wondering
if keith would still be ...
but i &apos;m glad he &apos;s happy .
you seem really great .
i know i owe it to charlie to tell keith .
it &apos;s just ... i don &apos;t think i can do it .
would you like me to ?
you would do that ?
i think i have to .
now , it &apos;s not exactly finished yet .
i &apos;m still waiting on a few pieces ,
and the curtains are on back order .
don &apos;t worry . i &apos;m sure it &apos;s amazing .
but you did keep the receipts , right ?
oh , my god .
it &apos;s exactly the room i wanted when i was growing up .
i mean , the only thing that &apos;s missing is ...
baby unicorns !
so ... you like it ?
oh , we love it . thank you , renee .
it &apos;s everything we &apos;d hoped for .
how did you put this together so quickly ?
oh , it was easy .
i &apos;ve been thinking about this room for 20 years .
really ?
there was a time when i thought i might have kids .
i used to imagine the kind of room
i &apos;d want my daughter to have .
right down to the last detail .
i never knew you thought about kids .
well , that was a long time ago .
it &apos;s never too late . heck , if we can adopt ...
excuse me . i &apos;ve gotta find that painter .
this is not the color we agreed on for the trim .
i can &apos;t do it . i can &apos;t be a party to this .
i can &apos;t wheel her down the aisle to marry some jackass
she doesn &apos;t even love .
lynette , you have to do this .
besides , you know , think of what &apos;s at stake now .
what are you talking about ?
well , you know , how can i put this delicately ?
i mean , today your mother has money .
someday soon she will die .
the day after that , tom and lynette have money .
that &apos;s a horrible thing to say .
well , just saying ,
you &apos;ve always wanted to put paige in private school ,
and i &apos;ve always wanted to know what it &apos;s like to sleep on a yacht .
you &apos;re lucky you &apos;re holding the baby .
lynette , in all seriousness ,
it &apos;s your mother &apos;s wedding day .
if you don &apos;t support her ,
you &apos;re gonna ruin your relationship .
lynette !
yeah ?
they &apos;re playing my song .
are you ready to wheel me down ?
lynette ! lynette !
lynette ! what are you doing ?
okay , here &apos;s the thing . i can &apos;t let you do this .
who asked you ?
you can &apos;t marry an obnoxious jerk like that .
mom , you want me to visit more often ?
that is never gonna happen if you &apos;re with him .
and think about the example
you are setting your grandchildren-- marrying a guy for his money .
now , look , tom and i have a little savings--
lynette ,
i know frank &apos;s a bit of an acquired taste .
but ... he needs me .
nobody needs me anymore .
your sisters are always busy .
i never see you .
i try to see you as much as i can , but--
i know .
your family needs you .
and frank ... needs me .
why didn &apos;t you tell me this ?
why did you let me think it was all about the money ?
i guess it was easier to say that
than to admit how ... useless and ...
lonely i feel .
okay .
hello ? we &apos;re trying to have a wedding out here .
oh , sorry ! my daughter doesn &apos;t think you &apos;re good enough for me .
she &apos;s right . now hurry it up .
this church is in one of those ethnic neighborhoods ,
and i &apos;m worried about the car .
renee , there is someone we &apos;d like you to meet .
this is our daughter .
hello .
we just picked her up from the airport ,
and we wanted you to be the first person on the lane to meet her .
oh , you didn &apos;t have to do that .
we know .
i think i &apos;m gonna start getting her settled in .
say good @-@ bye to mrs. perry .
bye .
come on .
she &apos;s absolutely precious .
yeah . we &apos;re very lucky .
listen , can i ask you for a favor ?
lee , you know i don &apos;t like sentences that start that way .
bob and i have been thinking ,
and even though i know we are gonna be great fathers ,
there may be times
that jenny needs to talk to a woman about ... stuff .
and on those rare occasions ,
i was wondering if we could bring her over here .
well ... sure .
great . i will go tell our daughter
that if she needs anything ,
she can count on her old auntie renee .
and if she ever calls me &quot; old auntie , &quot; i will kick her .
got it . sorry .
those are beautiful , susan .
thank you , ethan .
don &apos;t worry . they &apos;re not for you .
they &apos;re for people who still possess an ounce of humanity .
whatever you say , pollyanna .
but if i see any mylar balloons
with-- with dogs wearing stethoscopes ,
i &apos;m filing a complaint .
why are you always so miserable ?
it &apos;s called anger , susan .
i &apos;m sure you have it , too ,
right underneath that &quot; hang in there , kitty &quot; smile .
hey , dick , take it easy .
it &apos;s okay , ethan .
fine . you &apos;re angry . the rest of us aren &apos;t .
so stop dragging us into your circle of self @-@ pity .
ugh . come on .
it &apos;s me .
i &apos;m so happy for you .
thank you .
i gotta go call my mom .
yeah .
ready , susan ?
yes .
actually , um , if-- if it &apos;s okay ,
i &apos;m gonna ... sit over here today .
sure .
what are you doing ?
leaving a note for the gardener .
if he has any more problems with those sprinklers ,
i want him to know that we &apos;ll be at the cabin .
oh . good idea .
beth , i think we should bring some extra blankets .
it might get cold . would you mind grabbing a couple ?
not at all .
detectives . everything okay ?
i &apos;m sure your wife told you a gun was recently discovered
at bree van de kamp &apos;s house .
yes , apparently it was the same caliber
that i was shot with .
bree seems to think your wife planted it there ,
hoping to implicate some of her friends in your shooting .
what an imagination she has .
so you &apos;ve never seen this before ?
mr. young ?
yes .
you seemed to have quite a reaction there .
i &apos;m not comfortable around firearms , that &apos;s all .
well , just to be clear ,
you do not believe this belongs to your wife .
detectives , i know for a fact this is not beth &apos;s gun .
good day .
should we take two blankets or three ?
forget the blankets . the trip &apos;s off .
what ? why ?
i got a call . there &apos;s a problem with the cabin .
oh , shoot .
and i was so looking forward to it .
trust me , beth .
i think you dodged a bullet here .
i don &apos;t know what you do to this chicken ,
but it &apos;s the best thing that i &apos;ve ever had . mmm .
so i , um , stopped by bob and lee &apos;s house .
they &apos;re so excited about finally becoming fathers ,
which got me to thinking ,
i know you had said
that you were okay with not being able to have a child .
is that ... still the case ?
uh , yeah .
that didn &apos;t sound very convincing .
it &apos;s kind of a weird question .
okay , well , let me rephrase it .
if you had the chance to be a father , would you take it ?
bree , where is this coming from ?
i thought we dealt with this .
well , i just wanna make sure .
i don &apos;t want you to see
bob and lee with their child and start to have regrets .
what do you want me to say ?
all right , there was a time in my life when i thought , yeah .
yeah . i &apos;d love to be a dad , but then i met you .
i &apos;m just saying ... if you had the choice--
i don &apos;t .
this is really good chicken .
so ?
i &apos;m sorry .
he doesn &apos;t even wanna meet charlie ?
well , you have to understand that after six years ,
keith feels that it would be too difficult for everyone .
why did i wait so long ?
again , i am so sorry .
oh , no . you don &apos;t have to do that .
please . keith and i feel that we really need to do something .
so please ... take it .
sorry . i had to show the sitter how to work the tv .
now where is this chinese pl-- aah !
you put her in a car seat ?
oh . well , she &apos;s expensive , and the way you drive ...
honey , i &apos;ve been thinking
maybe we should go see a therapist together .
i don &apos;t need a therapist .
i think you do . maybe i haven &apos;t been fair to you .
but you do really need to talk to someone about this .
carlos , i &apos;m not crazy .
well , then should i change the reservation to three ?
don &apos;t be ridiculous . she &apos;s not gonna sit with us .

some put up walls because they have regrets .
yes , everyone has a reason for the ugly things they do ...
and once we find out why ...
