第六集 第十六集
We're fine, right?
Yes.
It'll come down to turnout today.
That's the thing to stress-- that everyone get out and vote.
It's too close not to.
Is it really?
Too close?
No, I...
I think we're solid.
Unless people don't turn out.
"Racism without racist"?
Excuse me?
Oh, I'm just commenting on the cheap shot taken at me
at the Black Business Leaders lunch.
Really? You thought that was cheap?
Not for me.
I lost key support in the African-American community.
It wasn't personal, Peter.
So, you don't personally think I'm a racist,
but saw a political advantage in calling me a racist?
I didn't specifically call you a racist.
You know, I see little comfort in that.
Let's just get through this.
Then we can get back to you using me politically.
Good morning. Good to see you all.
She's finally getting to vote for her favorite Florrick.
Mrs. Florrick and her husband
Governor Peter Florrick voted this morning.
The first couple looked confident
even as public polls have shown the race tightening.
Across town, the resurgent Prady campaign claim
that their internals
show the race in a dead heat.
Nicely done.
Perfect way to scare off the deer you don't want to hunt.
Don't you mock me. I'm holding a firearm.
What?
Most men prefer their wives in garters and hose.
You're late.
R.D., good to see you again.
This is my wife Diane.
Hello.
Pleasure. These are your permits.
Do not lose them, please.
R.D. will be taking us out to the blinds.
Have you hunted before?
No, first time.
Marvelous. Go get some grub,
and we'll see you out there.
So, this is the top one percent
of the top one percent of the top one percent?
We're not gonna talk like communists here, okay?
We discussed this.
I don't know.
I might start soliciting for the ACLU.
Your wife is unpredictable that way.
So, how did you get to know all these billionaires anyway?
R.D.
They're nice guys. You'll like them.
I like change.
If I were to set off a bomb in this room,
we'd have democratic presidents for the next 30 years.
Okay, let's just keep that to ourselves.
Oh, my Gosh.
Is that Gil Berridge?
No idea.
He's the king of Silicon Hills.
The Mark Zuckerberg of Austin, Texas.
What's he do?
At this point?
Count his $25 billion.
Gil Berridge?
Creator of the Kracker Web browser?
He and his wife are in the buffet line as we speak.
My God, there must be $400 million in legal fees in that dining room.
Wasn't there talk of Berridge leaving Sewell & Augustine?
I don't know, but landing him would fill the Chumhum hole.
Well, I am in nowhere, Wyoming,
with him for the next three days.
A perfect chance to pitch our firm.
I just need to know why he left Sewell & Augustine
so I can play to that.
We'll get back as soon as we find something.
Okay. We'll talk.
Hon, when we're out there
we'll be divided up into blinds, right?
Yes, two person blind. Why?
It would be really helpful to have a captive audience.
I thought we said three days no work, just fun.
We did.
This is fun.
Aren't you having fun?
You hunt deer.
I hunt clients.
But which head are we gonna mount over the fireplace?
Here, have one.
They're good. Nature's treat.
Okay, uh, there's nothing more for you to do today.
So, sit back, take a nap, just try to stay fresh for tonight.
Alicia, you can have one.
I'll keep you posted throughout the day.
We should have some sense of the turnout by noon,
but the official exit polling won't be until 4:00.
Oh, my God!
Sugar in my brain.
I know, Cool, right?
Uh, how are your speeches coming?
Good.
I've already written my acceptance speech.
I mean, I heard it was bad luck to write a concession speech.
Finn!
I, uh, I didn't think that you'd be here.
I was going to leave this for you at the door.
I just, uh, wanted to wish you good luck.
Thank you. Do you want to come in?
Would you like a donut?
Uh, no. But thanks.
Jon, you know Finn.
Yes, it's good to see you again.
Uh, yeah, it's, uh, for Alicia for today.
Okay, um... I'd better go.
I'm gonna call you in a few hours.
Okay. Thanks.
Can I open this now?
Yeah! Kind of the whole point.
A friend of mine gave me one of those
while I was waiting for a jury verdict.
It turns out the first-person shooter game
is exactly what I needed.
Oh, Halo? That's a good one!
Yeah!
One second.
Hello?
Mrs. Florrick, I just wanted to wish you good luck today.
Oh, well, thank you.
I'm sorry. Who is this?
It's Lemond.
Bishop.
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry, but it is, uh,
a very busy day and I have to go.
Dylan?
Why don't you wait for Kalinda in the other room?
Sure, Dad.
Is everything all right, Mr. Bishop?
I don't know.
I put a lot of money into Alicia's campaign.
I didn't do it because I'm a nice guy.
I know Alicia needs to keep me at arm's length.
For appearance sake.
But I will still need her help
when I need her help.
If Alicia wins, she's leaving the law firm.
Yes, and going to the S.A.'s Office.
Yeah.
I'm gonna need you to be the go-between for the two of us, Kalinda.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't think I can do that.
Yes, you can.
All right. Good.
Done.
Oh, God, you're good to me.
If I could have your attention.
Hello.
It's good to see you all again this year.
It's been an interesting year.
We've had our ups and downs.
The Republican Senate.
Now you know what it's like for me among your friends.
To celebrate this historic turn
I have a gift for the group.
Sacrificing welfare virgins?
I know our wives have been left to their own devices
over this long manly weekend
of testosterone-heavy blood lust.
But... no more.
I bought our lovely ladies a spa day.
Ladies, if you'd be so kind as to follow darla through the lobby.
Uh, now, where's Darla? There she is.
Wave your hand, Darla.
Like hell I'm going.
Coming, buddy?
I'll talk to you, hon.
Are you freaking serious?!
You can chase him tonight at dinner.
You're seriously thinking
of leaving me alone with all these Republican women?
I love you, and I'll bring you home an antlered buck.
Oh... this is... sexist!
Oh, dear God.
What can I say?
I am a proud husband
and an even prouder governor.
You look forward to working with your wife
if she gets elected?
As long as I don't get on her bad side.
I don't know if you've noticed,
but Alicia can be pretty tough.
Uh, Mandy, the Governor has a very busy day.
Are we nearly done here?
No, no, no.
That's-that's all right, Eli.
Let her do her job.
You know, all those years,
I was out running for office,
Alicia was the one that held the family together.
Now, she is committed, she's focused
and she's gonna be an excellent state's attorney.
Oh, you're speaking very confidently.
Think she has a good shot?
The precincts have barely started reporting.
We're a long way away.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, you can take it to the bank.
There's no question in my mind.
Alicia Florrick is going to be the next
state's attorney for Cook County.
What in the freaking bloody hell is he doing?
He just slaughtered us like blah-blah-blah cattle!
Okay, so we set up your avatar.
Wow! I look good.
Yeah, every girl's bra size increases a letter
when they become an avatar.
Hey, Jon, what's up?
Well, to be honest, your husband is bizarre.
How do I make her shoot?
There. That button on the side.
He just went off-script in an interview today.
He said you were definitely gonna be the next state's attorney.
Okay, good.
No, not good.
Uh... Jon, I don't think i'm getting...
He just depressed turnout, Alicia.
He said you were a slam dunk to be the next State's Attorney.
He just told every voter in Cook County that
they don't have to come out to the polls!
Oh.
Yeah. "Oh."
He just screwed you.
You're five points up, but only if they vote.
Only if they come out.
If they stay home, if they think you're secure?
You will lose.
Alicia, do you hear me?
Yes.
Why is he doing this?
I don't know.
We set up three more interviews with him today.
He can't keep saying this.
I'll talk to him.
Can he walk it back?
I don't know that he can.
I don't know, but remember
when I told you I think we're good?
Yeah.
We're not good.
Gentlemen, again, congratulations.
And thank you for your years of service.
Well, what are you doing here?
I thought you'd be holed up at home.
I was until I saw your Mandy Post interview.
Okay, let's just take this through here, shall we?
Just move it through here.
Well, you look unhappy
so I must have done something wrong.
Oh, come on, Peter, you know what you did.
Well, I know that I gave you a rave as a leader
and as a great decider.
I also know that on a day
that I was supposed to be talking about pensions,
I'm doing crime-related photo ops to help you.
So what else did I do?
"You can take it to the bank.
My wife is going to be the next state's attorney"?
Yes, she is.
You've read the polls.
What's going on, Peter?
Why are you pretending you didn't know what you did?
I do know what I did, and it was all about you, I...
Alicia, I think we should take this out to the car.
It's depressing the turnout.
Oh, that's nonsense.
I mean, that's political handler speak.
It is not.
Who told you that?
Elfman, to sound clever?
People don't come out to vote if they think you've won.
They read the polls; everybody reads the polls.
Not the polls we're seeing.
Everyone knows you're ahead.
I haven't said anything that is not true.
You remember that? The truth?
You don't want me to win.
I don't want you to win?
Really?
Yes, I suddenly just realized.
You want to be the only winner in the family.
Alicia, I have done nothing for the last three months
but work to get you elected.
Yes, like banging Ramona.
Okay, let's discuss this...
When you specifically promised me that you wouldn't.
Look, is that what's bothering you?
Then just say it. Just say it.
I did just say it.
You promised me you wouldn't see her anymore.
All right, don't psychoanalyze me.
I'm not psychoanalyzing you.
Then give me credit for being a fan.
For thinking that you'd actually be a great State's Attorney.
I am giving you credit for your political smarts.
You know when you go off-message.
No, no, no, I did not...
You know when you purposefully...
I did not go off-message.
I'm the governor, I have to say what I think.
Yes, but you don't just say the first thing
that comes to your mind, Peter.
Look, if you don't like what I'm saying,
then don't come to me with all your problems to fix.
Okay.
I won't.
And don't do any more interviews today.
Eli, you cancel the next two.
Great, gives me time to serve my state!
The thing is, the employment statistics are misleading
because everybody's only working part-time.
Because of Obamacare.
And that's not even counting the people who've stopped looking for work.
Which is why the unemployment numbers are so low.
Cary.
It was his wife.
What?
Gil Berridge left Sewell & Augustine
because his wife convinced him
they weren't attuned to the needs of a tech prodigy.
He's henpecked-- he does anything she says
just to shut her up.
She's there, right?
She's about ten feet away from me,
waiting to get her toes done.
I'll call you back.
Get the wife, and you get the husband.
Right.
Hi, Diane.
Georgette.
You were the one who wanted to go shooting, aren't you?
Yep.
Silly me.
Yeah.
It's a lot of cigars and corporate loophole talk.
Why don't you sit on down?
Well, you're a tall one, aren't you?
Oh, thank you.
I saw you and Gil at breakfast.
I, um, meant to stop over and say hello.
Do you know Gil?
No, I know Jim Sewell, Mm.
his former attorney.
Right, he's not with them anymore.
Yeah, I heard.
That's probably a smart move.
Um, not a good fit for a tech firm.
So you're a lawyer, too, then?
Is it that obvious?
No, you're not Jewish.
Gil hates all the Jews around.
He's not anti-Semitic or anything.
It's just...
I used to date a Jewish guy,
and I think he gets a little jealous.
So I heard you have a lot of sway with Gil.
Who said that?
Darla? She's a bitch.
Oh, he's just a man,
and men really secretly want to be manipulated.
Where's your firm, anyway?
Chicago.
I love Chicago.
Really?
I wanted to go to Disney World,
but my dad said maybe next time.
But we went swimming one day,
and there was a window under water.
In the pool.
I wanted to go to it,
but my dad said I couldn't because it was a bar.
Dylan, could you listen to your music for a second, please?
Why?
Please.
Just for a second.
Yeah?
Uh, it's behind me.
Two occupants
one black, one white.
Right, I see it.
I'm behind it.
This is what I need you to do, Kalinda.
You see the light up ahead?
Stop at it.
Don't move when it turns green.
Don't hang up.
All right.
Now. Now.
Get out of the car now! Now, move it!
You can go, Kalinda. Take Dylan to school.
Is-is everything all right, sir?
It is now.
Put 'em in the back.
Three hours into voting,
and the lines at the polls are getting crowded.
All signs point to this being a tight race.
Both camps expressed confidence
as they calmly wait for exit polls.
...really soon.
We've been here before.
This problem is growing
It's not too late
by the minute.
and we need to walk it back.
Alicia.
I talked to Peter, we're canceling the interviews.
Good.
No.
He needs to walk it back.
We need to get him to walk it back.
Where, Josh? Where is he gonna do that?
Let's not make this Alicia's problem-- you two decide.
A robocall, you know, a-a blah-blah.
It's not too late. It's never too...
No, it'll look like a desperate move.
It is a desperate move.
What are we talking about here?
Would you stop talking to each other
and start talking to me?
First of all, I need to say
your apartment is beautiful.
Thank you.
I just got married, I'm hiring a contractor.
Okay, the turnout's depressed.
We're losing a third of your voters.
You know that already?
Yes, it's throwing off my models,
and your precincts are the worst hit.
So I'm losing.
Well, your margin of error wasn't so blah-blah-blah.
Yes, yes, you're losing.
And if turnout is this low in the 'burbs,
Prady will win.
Is there anything Alicia can do about it at this point?
In terms of turnout, no.
Then come with me.
Wait.
W-Wait, we'll need her input.
When you want her input, come get us.
Who can we get to do a robocall, hmm?
We still have the after-work voters,
6:00 to 8:00 voters.
Or we could work on depressing Prady's votes.
How?
I have to talk to Peter.
Come on, hold that.
You know, the problem isn't even losing.
It's the wasted time.
And Peter.
Why encourage me to run if you're just...
Okay, you're JusticeGal, and I'm Badass Kicka'.
What?
Your avatar.
See, you're the one on top.
Push the joystick.
Why?
To kill me.
You missed. Marissa,
I don't want to do this right now.
Yes, you do.
Now, I'm gonna shoot at you.
Hey.
Yeah, you better fight, or I'll kill you.
Can you get something stronger in these babies?
Uh, bourbon.
Yeah, a small-batch.
Bring us the private reserve, the good stuff.
Oh, um, excuse me, Georgette.
So how is hunting and gathering going?
Good.
Listen, I need a favor.
I forgot my rifle in the bedroom.
You... I thought I saw you leave with your rifle?
Yes, I did.
But I brought the wrong one.
I need the 26-inch barrel.
This is you being nice to me.
I don't know, but Mr. Berridge and I are here in the blind,
and we need the proper weaponry.
There are no words for how much I love you.
So then I'll see you soon?
I'm on my way.
Hello, Mrs. Bishop?
How are you doing?
Actually, I'm not Mrs. Bishop.
Tabitha Gray, head of the parent's committee.
I've never seen you at meetings.
Uh, I just wanted to know if everything's all right.
Everything's fine.
Because I saw what happened back there,
on the way to school, with your husband.
Everything's all right, but thank you very much.
It-it looked like those men were dragged from their car...
I have to go. Bye.
Hey, why are you picking on me?
Because you keep exposing yourself.
Use the barriers.
Who's that?
I don't know-- shoot him.
Ah! He's shooting at me-- shoot him.
Who is he?
Some bad guy-- kill him!
What do we got here, couple of virgins?
Oh, who is he?
Someone's talking in my head.
I'm your worst nightmare, lady.
Keith, from Idaho.
Well, watch this, Keith from Idaho.
Alicia, do you have a minute?
Well, she's a bit tied down right now, guys.
Well, we need an answer on something, crazy lady.
What?
We're thinking about putting out a robocall
to get your people out to vote.
We think we can get the after-work voters riled up,
and they'll come out for you.
Damn it.
Oh, really? A-Are you sure you have time for this now?
You want me to do the robocall?
No, it's not about you.
We want to suggest that one of the initiatives is in trouble
unless people come out and vote for it.
Which one?
The privatization of parking meters.
People won't come out if I'm losing,
but they'll come out if parking meters are losing?
Yes, because it costs them money.
Didn't Daley sell Chicago's soul to the parking meter gods?
Yes, for a billion dollars in return.
God, there is something truly sad about...
Die, scumbag!
Not if we use it.
We just need you to get Peter on board to do this robocall.
Right now, the initiative is winning by six points.
We just need Pete to convince people that it's losing by six.
He won't do it.
He will if he knows you're gonna lose.
That's why he won't.
Alicia, we are at that point
where you can lose the election.
I know.
And I'm the last person Peter will do it for.
Okay, we need someone that people implicitly trust
to record a call for us.
What about what's-his-name?
Uh, uh, uh, the oatmeal guy?
Blah-blah-blah?
The Quaker?
No, no, I eat oatmeal.
I'm old, and I eat oatmeal.
Wilford Brimley?
Yes.
Uh, isn't he dead?
Or the president.
Obama?!
No.
Him, the... come on.
Why am I the only one thinking here?
Martin Sheen?
Yeah.
在电视剧「白宫群英」中饰演约书亚·巴特勒总统
Oh, my God. It's scaring me-- I'm on his wavelength now.
Well, we better call someone, 'cause we've got
two hours to record and air a call.
ATV from the north 50 feet.
Roger, standing down.
Hey, Gil,
my wife, Diane Lockhart.
Diane, you remember Gil and R.D.
Mr. Berridge.
Ma'am.
Is that the one you want?
Yep, that's her.
Oh, and I was told by the driver to tell you
that the deer are being flushed.
Although, I don't know what that means.
It means the hunting's about to get good.
Will you join us?
Oh, you don't mind?
Please.
Oh, great.
Is this your first time?
Uh, shooting anything alive, yes.
Well, don't worry, we won't make you drink the blood.
Georgette warned me about, uh, your sense of humor.
She said the way to get at your good side
is to get you laughing.
Is that right, Gil?
Is that how we get on your good side?
I didn't know I had a good side.
Georgette said that you were looking for a new firm.
A law firm?
Really? Uh, what else was Georgette saying?
Well, that you needed a bigger firm,
one with deeper connections in politics.
And she was happy to hear we no longer represent Chumhum.
And she told me how much, uh, she loves Chicago.
I'm sorry to be rude--
I'm gonna stop you right there.
Diane, boys...
Uh, if you'll excuse me,
I think I might have a better line of sight from another blind.
Well, is everything all right?
Yes. Uh...
I just like trading blinds.
Yeah, I'm good.
Can you call out the all-clear, R.D.?
Roger. Hunter moving blinds, stand down.
Roger.
Did I say something wrong?
R.D.?
Uh, well, I can think of one thing.
Uh, Georgette isn't his wife.
Uh, she's his call girl.
Kurt's talking to Gil in the eastern blind.
Everything's fine.
He might even come back.
I didn't know.
She didn't seem like she was... working.
We've been letting Gil get away with that
for a few years now.
He said he could bring either a...
a call girl or a Democrat.
People voted, said they'd rather the call girl.
That was a joke, right?
No.
Well, was there a vote about me?
What about you?
Being a Democrat?
I suppose your husband's
conservative enough for the both of you.
Want one?
Thank you.
So what should we talk about?
Killing babies?
Sure. Why the hell not?
We both have rifles.
Let's see what comes of this.
Kick that weapon to me. I'm going to the top of that building.
There's ammunition up there.
Where is the rest of our team? I need help here.
Hey, watch out. Behind you! To the left!
Hey, we got a friendly here.
He just saved you. Thanks.
Who is it?
"Coolbeans."
Thanks, Coolbeans.
We got some nerds from Seattle after us. Want to run with us?
Sure. This way.
Hey, I've been here before; stay to the left.
Finn?
Hey, JusticeGirl.
You know, you're racking up some pretty good kills.
Thanks.
Best election day gift ever.
Hey, watch out. Behind you.
Mr. Sheen, it's Jonathan Elfman calling.
Yes, sir.
Well, no, I'm with the Florrick campaign now, sir,
and we were hoping maybe you'd record a robocall for us today.
Mr. Whitford. Hi.
I'm a campaign adviser for Alicia Florrick.
You've been a big supporter, and we were hoping that...
He's suggesting one of the other cast members.
Who?
Uh, Melissa Fitzgerald.
One of the secretaries.
Ooh, the one who died.
What? No.
No, I mean died on the show.
I don't know. Should I call?
I mean, it's not as impressive as the fictional president.
The fictional dead secretary to the fictional president?
2:30. We need someone. Call.
Okay. Mr. Sheen, you know,
we're gonna take you up on that advice.
支持妇女堕胎的权利
The Supreme Court has upheld a woman's right to choose since 1973.
Ah, the great, wise body.
And they've done so repeatedly
and with Scalia and Alito on the Court.
You know, once upon a time the court also upheld Dred Scott.
成为南北战争的关键起因之一
Oh, God! Do you realize every other Western democracy
mocks us for still having this debate?
"Simili autem modo neque mulieri
pessum abortivum concedam..."
So now we drag out the Latin.
I mean, the original Hippocratic oath
orders doctors to swear by Apollo.
Are we to do that now?
A woman who knows her Latin.
I'm impressed.
Yes, a woman
who should have the right to choose.
Notice the word.
Have you ever seen a five-month-old fetus?
No.
Have you ever seen a woman dead from a backstreet abortion?
Yep.
And I have seen a five-month-old fetus.
But I also know that science gives that fetus
20% to 35% survival rate at five months, all right?
In other words, at the same moment, any woman in America...
And the world.
And the world, can get an abortion,
science gives that infant a 30% chance of survival.
So what?
Abortion is murder?
At six months,
survival rate goes up to 50%.
So, you would put women in jail?
Come on, imprison them?
I'm not saying that.
Yes, you are. What is the option?
Admit the facts.
Don't look away from the aborted fetus.
Look at it.
Why is it not a baby?
And-and why are we kitchifying
Good word.
These babies and... Thank you.
Kitchifying babies and turning 'em
into these cute little Raphael cherubs,
at the same time, we're aborting 1.2 million of them a year?
Because it's legal,
and because you still haven't answered the question.
What are the options?
I don't need an option.
It's not up to me to have an option.
Because you're a man.
Come on. That's beneath you.
No, it's not, because I just said it,
and you still haven't answered.
Look, bottom line, I like people.
I like you.
I mean, you seem smart, I think.
I don't know why that next fetus wouldn't turn into you,
or me,
and what would be lost to the world
if it were to be aborted.
Would you guys shush?! Here they come!
Here they come.
Voters are motivated by their self interests.
They're going to cast their vote for the candidate...
Are you looking for Dylan?
He's inside... with the headmaster.
Why?
Attention, students.
Hey, Dylan?
What's going on? You're late.
Dad.
But this is not up for discussion.
We've decided to counsel Dylan out of the school.
This is not a good fit.
His grades are stellar. His fees are paid.
I'm not seeing a problem here.
I'm sure you do see the problem, Mr. Bishop.
We cannot endanger
the other students with your son's presence.
Look, Dylan, why don't we head home?
Your dad will meet us there.
Hi.
Do you remember me?
I'm Melissa Fitzgerald.
I played Miss Landingham on West Wing.
It's "The" West Wing, and Mrs. Landingham,
and I didn't play Mrs. Landingham on The West Wing.
Yes. Sorry. We knew that.
Sorry. Uh, uh, uh, it was an earlier draft,
and we had to fire her, an intern.
But we want you.
You sure?
Oh, yes.
We're gonna send you a blah-blah, a corrected draft.
Right, Marissa?
Uh, yes, Mr. Mariner.
I will. Here I go, doing that.
I played Carol on The West Wing.
"I know that if you're anything like me,
you hate overpaying for parking."
I don't drive.
You don't? Nope, I take Ubers.
Do you want me to say,
I know if you're anything like my friends, you...
Uh, Miss Landingham...
or Fitzgerald,
as good as this is all going,
I have to take this phone call.
It's the, you know, the exit polling, so...
What about the morning-after pill?
It's proven, it's effective.
Right there. You see it?
Yes.
We got the line of sight. It's all yours. Take a shot.
I-I can't. Not like this.
Come on.
It's a pest. Deer are a hazard.
They carry ticks. They're overpopulated.
If you don't take the shot, I will.
It's just grazing. It's not doing anything.
Would you do it if it were charging you?
There you go. It's on the move.
Take it down! Take it down! If you don't, I will!
Alicia Florrick is going
to be the next State's Attorney for Cook County.
That was Governor Peter Florrick earlier today saying things
he may end up regretting as we keep a close watch...
Okay, tell me what's gone wrong.
We got the first batch of exits.
You know how we talked about this being a turnout election?
Yeah. Prady's hitting his numbers and then some.
We're not.
So what does that mean?
It means you should start working on your concession speech.
Come on, it's not over.
Please. I've been around politics long enough to know
if you're chasing robocalls,
hoping to get a last-minute push at the polls,
you're doomed.
Not until the last vote is cast.
Finn, really, I'm okay with it.
Alicia.
I'm serious.
Most first-time candidates don't succeed, right?
You ran a great race.
No.
I didn't.
The right man's winning.
Well, did you write a concession speech?
I did that months ago.
It was the first thing I did after declaring.
And the thing is, losing is actually a relief.
Well, then,
congratulations.
I just told Elfman that I wouldn't do the robocall.
I think you should reconsider.
Alicia's defeat could be a major embarrassment.
I can already hear the pundits laying blame,
replaying the sound bite of you saying she's the next S.A.
Eli, I cannot do that robocall.
It's stupid, it's obvious.
Okay.
Then what?
Is that, uh... mine?
Congratulations.
Good shot.
You all right?
Oh, yes.
It's just meat. We eat it every day.
Yes, and someone else kills it
in some godforsaken slaughterhouse
while...
I killed it... in nature.
But, uh...
You don't need to do it again.
You don't need to hunt.
You don't understand.
I liked it.
Sorry.
We've got good news and better news.
First off, Gil Berridge is definitely in play.
He axed Sewell & Augustine
because he felt like they were taking on too many cases with conflicts.
Yeah, thanks, but I think
Gil Berridge may be a non-starter.
What did you do, Diane?
Or what didn't you do?
Too long and complicated.
What's the other news?
Well, it turns out the fourth richest man
in America is at your little shindig.
Who?
Reese Dipple. He's right behind Bill Gates,
Warren Buffett and Larry Ellison.
Reese Dipple?
Yeah, you don't hear about him
because his conglomerates are all unsexy businesses,
like industrial gases, pulp and paper.
He mostly gives to anti-choice causes.
R.D.?
Yeah, did you meet him?
Uh, what does he look like?
He doesn't like being photographed,
so we don't have anything recent.
All right, I'll call you back.
Welcome back to coverage of the Cook County...
I need to talk to you about something.
Sure.
You want something else?
No, it's fine.
This is the third school Dylan has had to leave.
Look, I'm sure you'll find a good school.
Mm. And that school will ask him to leave.
My life is strangling any chance of him living his.
You're being followed, Kalinda.
What?
The men we stopped in the SUV,
the ones following you to school,
they weren't following Dylan.
They were following you.
Why?
They work for the state's attorney's office.
ASA Geneva Pine.
We're seeing lower than expected turnout in suburbs
like Barrington, Northbrook, Orland Park--
all of which were expected to favor Mrs. Florrick.
For now, though, with only 46% of precincts reporting,
the race is still neck-and-neck.
Until the loop and inner-city precincts report.
that's where Prady's voters are,
and then we're gonna get buried.
Marissa, could you please?
What?
Will you stop it with the cappuccino?
Hey, at least I have a skill
to fall back on if this falls through.
You want my advice?
Plan something fun for tomorrow just in case.
You know, go for dinner with somebody.
That's what I do when I'm waiting for a verdict to come in.
Thanks.
If I drink any more coffee,
I'm gonna be up straight through tomorrow.
Wait, behind you!
Good shot, thanks.
Don't mention it, partner.
You know what, you're right.
I do need to plan something.
Have dinner with me tomorrow night.
Uh, I'd love to,
but I can't-- I have plans.
Look, I feel like a jerk because I suggested it,
but, um...
I'm actually seeing somebody.
It only just started, but, uh...
No, that-that's great.
But, you know, I-I can reschedule.
Oh, n-n-no, don't be silly.
Alicia, you got to get in here.
Okay, I'm coming!
Hey, Finn.
I have to go.
I will...
talk to you soon, okay?
Uh, yeah.
Sure.
Northbound Lower Wacker is your best bet.
Back to you Rob.
What's going on?
As you can see from this footage, traffic is at
a standstill in the loop because of the governor's speech.
If possible, you're going to want
to avoid that area at all costs.
He's giving a last-minute, you know, speech from Daley Plaza,
and that's gonna kill Prady's turnout.
Nobody wants to fight traffic to get to the polls.
It's gonna smother all the after-work voters.
...speech about crime rates and pensions,
the governor urged all citizens...
You think he knew what he was doing?
No. Not after he fought us the way that he did.
He knew.
The polling stations do not close till 7:00 p.M.

What's the matter, don't you like our venison?
Uh, no, I'm, uh... I'm just not hungry...
Reese?
I never really liked that name.
Aren't you going to pitch me?
Is there any reason to?
I am looking for a new law firm.
Mr. Dipple,
we spent two hours arguing over abortion.
Very enjoyable hours.
I like working with people I don't necessarily agree with.
We won't argue any anti-choice cases.
Pro-life cases?
Pro-life cases, either. We won't.
Give me a call on Friday, we'll talk.
Welcome back to coverage
of the Cook County State's Attorney race.
All eyes are on the candidates...
Will they call it right at 7:00 p.M.?
If the numbers are, you know, trending strong enough.
Here we go.
...as the polls are officially closing now in Cook County.
And apparently, CBS is prepared to predict a winner
in the hotly-contested State's Attorney race.
And we'll have those results for you right after the break.
It's a busy night in Cook County as returns
continue to stream in, and, as promised,
we can make a call in the Cook County State's Attorney race.
In a race with enough star power to fuel
a dozen state's attorney battles,
legal commentator Frank Prady
faced attorney and wife of the governor, Alicia Florrick.
And Alicia Florrick
has held off Frank Prady's aggressive...
Here's a live look at the florrick headquarters
where they've just gotten the news.
Looks like they're celebrating already.
Hello.
Alicia, congratulations!
Oh, Eli. Uh, thank you.
There's nothing like your first win.
Uh, yeah, I suppose so. Uh...
A bit surreal.
Believe me, they'll be bursting your bubble soon enough,
so, tonight, savor it.
I'll try.
Um... Eli, is Peter coming to the victory party?
Of course. We'll see you there.
Thanks, Maria.
So what now for Frank Prady?
This has been suggested to be one of the most
heavily financed State's Attorney races in the county's history.
Will Frank Prady throw his hat
into the political arena again after this?
His campaign has just released a statement saying
that he will be making his concession speech within the next hour.
We have cameras standing by at Prady headquarters...
Thank you for meeting me like this.
No problem.
Gives me a chance to concede in person.
Oh. Sorry.
No, no, no. Congratulations.
Good job.
So, what couldn't wait?
Come work with me.
Work with you? What do you mean?
At the State's Attorney's office.
Be the deputy.
Be your second?
Yes. Be my corrective.
A team of rivals?
Yes.
No.
Why not? We'd be great together.
One good thing came out of our campaign,
our positions were clarified,
and I essentially don't believe in your approach, Alicia.
I-I think it's based in pessimism and not optimism.
And I don't think it will work.
But besides that...?
I better go.
I have a concession speech to give.
You're sure?
Yes.
She won.
I never had any doubt she would.
Now I need you more than ever.
I'm getting out.
Excuse me?
This is the end for me.
I'm giving up the trade,
going straight.
I need you to go to Alicia and tell her I am ready to retire.
But she needs to get Geneva Pine to drop this investigation.
Retired dealers always end up in prison.
They lose their power, they lose their clout.
Everybody comes gunning for them.
I need to know that I'll stay free.
So, are you staying or going?
I don't know.
There's a job in L.A.,
but I've grown to like Chicago.
You?
Alicia could use the help.
Yeah. Maybe.
But then, I've never been a guy to stay in one place.
So you're going?
Take care of her.
