第六季 第十集
yahoo !
three weeks earlier .
huh ?
you know how sometimes a movie or a show
begins on a random , intriguing scene with no context given
encouraging you to wonder whoa ,
how &apos;d this crazy scenario come to be ?
and then it cuts to black and a title comes up and
says three weeks earlier .
here we are .
sitting in silence , crammed into an rv .
winding through the mountain roads of colorado
with a 19 foot fiberglass hand tied to the roof .
if there was ever a time to cut to three weeks earlier
it &apos;d be right now .
know what i mean ?
elroy you got any booze ?
don &apos;t go through my stuff !
this isn &apos;t a bus .
you &apos;re standing in my living room , kitchen , and bedroom .
ooh i never thought about that .
and your backyard is 24,900 miles long ,
because it &apos;s the circumference of the earth .
because you have no home .
did anyone need water ?
what else can we talk about ?
i guess to make it really intriguing ,
one of us should be visibly injured in a way
that makes you wonder how it happened
like if britta had a black eye .
dean , can i speak to you privately ?
i &apos;m pretty sure the answer is no .
coming up .
you know , when i agreed to hold this thing for you and the school ,
you didn &apos;t say anything about six people sitting back there .
man , i wonder what they &apos;re talking about .
god ! who knows ?
they &apos;re sealed off behind this soundproof vinyl .
i will drive my house off a cliff .
elroy , we &apos;re not here
to snoop or judge you .
you &apos;re not the first person to have dirty dishes , cd rom porn and
framed photos of yourself with two biracial teenagers in a park .
it &apos;s not that .
all of this weight .
i may have miscalculated the mileage .
darn it , i wanna hijack this rv ,
but i &apos;m foiled by its impenetrable
post @-@ 2001 security measures .
you keep driving
and nobody else needs to know about this , understand ?
the last thing we need is a panic .
what &apos;s going on ?
are we out of gas ?
yes !
it &apos;s on empty !
it &apos;s on empty !
like , the needle is invisible .
oh , my god !
there &apos;s no needle .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s underneath the plastic or
maybe the engine tried to use it as the fuel .
oh , stop yelling .
well , stop being out of gas .
you &apos;re freaking me out .
you should be freaking out .
i have been driving for 25 years ,
and i have never seen so little gas in my life .
stop , stop ,
i &apos;m yelling even louder so you have to stop .
we &apos;re not in control of the gas , okay ?
we have to focus on what we can control .
is everyone &apos;s phone charged ?
yes . charge your phones .
good idea .
okay .
okay .
see ?
we turned panic into preparedness .
now if we do run out of gas , guess who &apos;s got fully charged phones ?
well charged .
full battery .
for the love of god , stop charging your phones !
excuse me a moment .
what happened ?
i &apos;m not telling you !
fair enough .
we &apos;re all gonna die !
all in favor ?
and that solves the matter of the giant hand .
if there &apos;s no other business .
yes .
i &apos;d like to move that we establish this moment
as the opening for a flashback .
no . meeting adjourned .
oh , i guess we &apos;ll not doing the three weeks earlier thing .
abed insert dialogue here by you dropping the fourth wall shtick .
nice .
careful you don &apos;t flood it .
that &apos;s the fifth time you &apos;ve reminded me not to flood something .
i &apos;m sorry but it doesn &apos;t apply to our situation .
i &apos;m gonna check the battery .
can you send someone or not ?
can you please hold ?
no , i can &apos;t hold .
darn it .
when they put you on hold , you hang up and you call right back .
frankie taught me that .
hi , it &apos;s me .
yeah , the one you put on hold .
see where that got you ?
can you send somebody or not ?
please hold .
don &apos;t you dare .
when they put you on hold , hang up and call right back .
i can play this game all day .
i told you we need roadside service on
could you please hold ?
oh , you can &apos;t be serious .
well hello , guess who .
i got nothing but fingers and time , pal .
road side service , moffett pass .
all right , all right .
you , well , you could &apos;ve told me that an hour ago .
rv is full of crazy ladies .
your rv is full of crazy ladies , good bye .
have any of you heard of armed forces day ?
because apparently it &apos;s today and it &apos;s really boning us .
yep , here it is , armed forces day , huh .
why would they put it in may ?
it &apos;s just sitting there in memorial day &apos;s shadow
like a military hanukkah .
fitting that both war holidays have to fight each other
over the same month .
notable that the one we remember
is the one with the theme of memory .
way to make this about justifying your unmarketable sensibilities .
well , apparently armed forces day
is the big one for tow truck drivers .
because there are three within 200 miles of this spot
and they &apos;re all in the same parade .
maybe it &apos;ll come by this way
if we offer them instruments ?
nobody reroutes parades .
they rerouted kennedy &apos;s parade .
so , we &apos;ll just call the cia ,
tell them we want to assassinate the president ,
and we &apos;ll be home in time for wheel of fortune .
who are we kidding ?
that &apos;ll never work .
we got britta &apos;d , yes , i use it too .
i don &apos;t want anybody here blaming themselves for this .
i want everyone blaming frankie .
what ?
she is the reason we are here .
this is what happens when you make decisions
outside the moment .
whatever moment you were in the day
you got on the internet and bought a gigantic hand ,
i am proud to remain outside until i die .
you will baby .
and this is where logic gets you ,
stuck in a rocky mountain pass at sundown ,
gradually freezing to death .
and forced to decide somewhere
in the backs of our heads , just in case ,
who we &apos;d eat first .
annie , right ?
what ?
it &apos;s not a judgement , it &apos;s about biology .
what ?
craig , the hand currently crushing our lives
is not about being in the moment .
you bought this thing we can &apos;t return
with money we don &apos;t have ,
nobody knows why .
and your latest idea is to put it on the quad with a plaque
that says give a hand to your brain .
give your brain a hand .
you &apos;re making it sound stupid on purpose .
it &apos;s over craig , you are lucky to have frankie .
and you &apos;re lucky she was able to find some weirdo ,
excuse me , bigger weirdo on ebay willing to pay cash for it .
this is a lot of narrative pipe .
maybe we did need a three weeks earlier flashback .
abed . is this a show ?
i thought you said you knew it wasn &apos;t a tv show .
season two you mean ?
i don &apos;t know .
i can change my mind .
well can i ask that it not be a show about you saying it &apos;s a show ?
because dumb .
you &apos;re dumb .
go in the back .
go in the back and sit by yourself .
jeff .
give him a shot .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
i &apos;m sick of it .
it &apos;s a show , it &apos;s not a show ,
it &apos;s your show , it &apos;s my show ,
it &apos;s a good show , it &apos;s a bad show .
i am sick of it .
i don &apos;t want to hear the word show again .
show , show , show , is a show , show , show .
so now it &apos;s a show about this ?
oh , you &apos;re right , that &apos;s way worse .
abed , come back .
yes .
abed , come back .
yes , yes , yes .
i &apos;m not sorry .
it &apos;s not good to be back .
what the hell was that ?
the battery is dead .
flooded ?
so help me god .
the rv has two batteries ,
a primary , and a second ... - secondary .
we overloaded the electrical system , and killed the engine battery .
so now , the secondary battery has maybe
three or four hours of juice ...
charge ,
juice , charge .
then we have a choice to make .
and jeff can explain that choice .
no , it &apos;s your rv .
this was my show . you didn &apos;t give a damn about that .
abed , we &apos;re all on your side ,
so if you &apos;re also on your side , it &apos;s petty .
we could wait for a couple of hours and
hope that the engine battery resets itself .
if it doesn &apos;t , then we &apos;re spending the night here ,
and at least we have the secondary battery
to keep us warm for a few hours .
no , no , no , we &apos;re not spending the night here ,
so what &apos;s the second option ?
which i am nicknaming little course of action .
i rewire the secondary battery to the engine
and hope it can start it .
if it doesn &apos;t we &apos;re spending a very cold night
with two dead batteries .
okay , let &apos;s switch the batteries then .
good democracy .
are we sure the secondary battery won &apos;t just die too ?
ha .
it &apos;s a possibility .
it exists .
but i &apos;m pretty confident ,
because the secondary battery only powers the cabin .
and we &apos;ve kept the lights off and
it goes without saying that
we &apos;ve all learned to stop charging our phones .
why you all looking at each other like that ?
and where are each of your phones now ?
you know , i &apos;m starting to suspect the unthinkable .
namely , that in spite of all we &apos;ve experienced ,
there &apos;s a cartoonish vampiric orgy of personal devices
somewhere in the rv
sucking away our remaining battery .
i only draw limited comfort from the fact
that nobody &apos;s running to unplug anything .
you know what ?
say nothing .
i &apos;ll just , turn the light switch to the on position .
there is a bright side to this .
most conventional weapons don &apos;t require electricity .
are you going to eat me first ?
hear those crickets ?
this would be a challenging place to practice your stand @-@ up act .
so i rented hotel rwanda the other night .
and let me just say , not a date movie .
what would arnold schwarzenegger sound like
if he was bit by dracula ?
all in favor ?
then that solves the matter of the giant hand .
if there &apos;s no other business ...
if we &apos;re doing this i &apos;d like to restate
importance of telling some of this story with flashback .
what do you mean by restate ?
oh my god , i fell for it .
meeting adjourned .
why do we call them elbows ?
why not arm knees ?
man , i am dying up here .
i &apos;m scaling the blanket rations inversely
to the wattage of each person &apos;s phone .
that way the person who killed us the most will die the soonest ,
which feels fair .
right , britta ?
i can &apos;t go all night being this angry .
heart attacks run in my family and you people aren &apos;t worth it .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay .
i caused the situation by not topping off the tank ,
and that vinyl accordion partition is a totem of distrust .
sorry for that , too .
elroy , that &apos;s big of you .
and for our part , we &apos;re sorry that charging our perfectly normal
cell phones destroyed your weirdly fragile rv .
okay , i &apos;m sorry about that apology .
i &apos;ll try to be a better house guest .
oh , no .
sorry i &apos;ve been unavailable ,
i &apos;ve been trying to cut to three weeks earlier .
really feels like we needed that .
i have something to apologize for as well .
perhaps you recall earlier when it seemed
as though we drove through a skunk patch .
yeah , you were getting high .
yeah , you were smoking pot .
yeah , getting high .
you were getting stoned .
okay , i remember thinking i really pulled that one off .
you thought that because you were high .
you also thought that we were speeding
cause you kept seeing the same bird .
all in favor ?
then that solves the matter of the giant hand .
if there &apos;s no other business ...
let me just explain the need for flashback here
and don &apos;t interrupt ...
okay , one quick thing
and then you can talk about flashbacks forever .
meeting adjourned .
abed ?
when they cut to three weeks earlier on tv ,
they &apos;re not traveling in time , dip ass .
jeff .
okay , my apology now .
i &apos;ve had some time to think about it ,
and i &apos;ve decided , i &apos;m sorry for
not asking people what they wanted
before buying all the snacks for the trip .
wow , really ?
that &apos;s great .
what ?
think about it , it &apos;s the worst thing i &apos;ve done on this trip .
i &apos;ve been nailing it .
she has .
you have , i haven &apos;t been .
i shouldn &apos;t be yelling at the dean in front of any of you ,
it &apos;s unprofessional .
you &apos;re all right , frankie .
we got no complaints .
i forgive all of you .
what ?
then that solves the matter of the giant hand .
if there &apos;s no other business ...
in a normal road trip story ,
the first act would end with us deciding to go on the trip .
the second act would be the trip ending with a disaster ,
and the third act would be us getting back .
the problem is that
we &apos;ve already decided to take this trip weeks from now ,
which means the story starts with us already on the road ,
which means the end of act one won &apos;t be us going on the trip ,
it &apos;ll have to be the disaster .
which means something even worse has to happen in act two .
unless we make the decision , right now ,
that act one is a flashback ,
so that the beginning story is now instead of then .
you forgive us ?
absolutely .
you turd !
i beg your pardon .
guys ?
you have no sense of accountability .
you &apos;re like a child .
if i &apos;m a child , you &apos;re a child abuser .
no , not cool , annie .
you never just said , leave my hand where it is ,
i like it there . i demand it stay .
because everyone complained about it .
well , where &apos;s that commitment to spinelessness
when we &apos;re all admitting we did stuff wrong ?
okay , i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m a bad dean , okay ?
no , that &apos;s what you always do .
that &apos;s not a real apology .
jeff ?
abed , shut up .
go flashback and cut to stuff .
and you , say you &apos;re sorry for
buying a giant hand and letting it sit around
until we had to deal with it ,
and say it without crying .
no !
i &apos;m an adult .
and you can &apos;t make me not cry .
you &apos;re all a bunch of bullies ,
and i will say , i &apos;m sorry , however i want .
and by the way , i &apos;m not sorry !
it &apos;s my giant hand and i love it .
we &apos;re not selling it .
okay , this is like crate training a puppy .
everyone suppress every instinct you have to let him out
and sleep in bed with us .
cold .
no , i mean , it &apos;s cold in the rv .
i don &apos;t care how we treat the dean tonight .
abed , don &apos;t go out .
did they send you out here to be mean to me too ?
no .
good .
because i can &apos;t cry anymore unless someone brings me a pedialyte .
here .
pretty comforting , huh ?
we could &apos;ve put it outside the art department , or biology ,
or wood working if we remove one of the fingers .
you don &apos;t belong up here .
it &apos;s not right that you &apos;re up here .
you get it , don &apos;t you , abed ?
you know what &apos;s important about the hand ?
no , i know what &apos;s important about the story ,
and i know we &apos;re structurally overdue for a disaster .
oh , great .
figures the one person on my side ,
is the one playing people chess .
don &apos;t move , don &apos;t move !
what the hell else are we supposed to do ?
flashback with me .
what ?
just trust me .
i set a flashback three weeks earlier .
it &apos;s how this story begins .
close your eyes and concentrate .
and that solves the matter of the giant hand .
if there &apos;s no other business ...
oh , there &apos;s business .
yeah , there &apos;s business .
when you tie the hand to the roof
we &apos;d like you to use extra thick straps please .
extra thick .
extra thick straps !
reinforced .
all right . meeting adjourned , great .
extra thick straps !
extra thick straps .
extra thick straps .
extra thick straps .
there , that should do it .
wha , wha , what should do it ?
we made the straps extra thick .
remember ?
no , i don &apos;t remember
because it didn &apos;t happen .
it didn &apos;t ?
what ?
did something just fall off the roof ?
that &apos;s a really stupid question , annie .
obviously something fell off the roof .
the question is what ?
abed , where &apos;s the dean ?
oh , damn , come on .
okay , one , two , three .
carefully , carefully .
how do you lose a hand off a person haphazardly ?
you know what , annie .
dean , hang on .
dean , we &apos;re so sorry , we love you .
screw you !
what ?
hey , that &apos;s my house .
we are not sorry , we hate you !
are we gonna freeze to death ?
i call the hand .
the fiberglass will preserve body heat .
what &apos;s wrong with me if that &apos;s hot ?
dean these temperatures are lowering our immune systems
in a world that is swarming with
weird people &apos;s unvaccinated toddlers .
deal with it .
i &apos;m gonna go run to the other side
and see if he &apos;s locked that door too .
it probably undercuts my goals to announce it out loud
but i &apos;m a verbal thinker ,
i &apos;m not even sure i have an idea until i say it .
they should make hiking boots with a compass in the toe .
go !
but don &apos;t you .
dean , we &apos;re sorry and we love you ?
nice uncontrollable question mark , britta !
you can &apos;t even fake it !
dean , we &apos;re sorry and we love you .
super realistic , annie , you &apos;re a real sociopath .
i saw all your true colors when the chips were down .
abed is the only human among you !
and i think we all know how ironic that is ,
no offense , abed .
none possible .
abed , you bonded with him .
talk to him .
you &apos;re alone in the end zone .
this ball is yours or nobody &apos;s .
i appreciate your appeal to my well know
passion for athletics ,
and sarcasm , but i didn &apos;t actually bond with him .
i almost killed him .
my naive obsession with contrived flashback technique has kept me
from being invested in any of this actual story .
i mean , what was it even ?
a bunch of people in an rv ? and i had to christopher nolan it ?
well , there you go .
now you can forget all about
stupid three weeks earlier flashbacks
and be a hero by joining us here , in the moment ,
and talking to the dean like a human .
that &apos;s my arc .
that &apos;s your arc .
okay , here we go .
if there &apos;s no other business .
i &apos;d like to propose a heavy use of flashback in this episode .
no abed , don &apos;t do it .
thanks abed .
stop that .
get your head out of your ass .
i don &apos;t know how . i &apos;m over saturated with it .
give me ,
i , i , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s real .
you are lying .
you have to be lying .
you enjoy this .
stop this .
what has gotten into you ?
why are you shocked that he &apos;s alienated ?
you get him to do something normal
without abusing him .
abed , listen .
this is a flashback remember .
the real story is happening in the future .
you actually flashed back to now to help us .
okay , that was pretty good .
so sad what happened here , all those centons ago .
so sad .
so preventable .
space elder abed , can you reach backward with your mind
and save our species ?
i can .
i &apos;m space elder britta .
what are you guys talkin about ?
i &apos;m here now , child .
all will be made right .
dean .
abed .
i have discovered the meaning of the giant hand .
a hand has two functions , to grip and to release .
but without both of these powers , it is useless .
like newborn infants ,
we grab what comes near us ,
hoping to control it , taste it ,
jam it into another child &apos;s eye .
but , the time we spend in control of our world ,
is the time we spend letting go of others .
ideas , stories , pride ,
girls in soft sweaters , video games ,
buttered noodles , grip one for too long
and you lose so much that you &apos;ve never held .
this giant hand , was sent to all of us as an invitation .
to increase our mastery over the power to hold on .
and let go .
sorry .
dummy .
i kinda hate you .
the doors are locked on that side , too .
took you long enough .
i &apos;d be lying if i said i didn &apos;t poop .
could you lie then ?
sure i can .
sure i can .
i slapped a man .
where were you ?
hi , this is blake ,
the gentleman to whom you &apos;re selling the giant hand .
i am calling to confirm that you have the correct address ?
we live at the end of a long driveway
which often gets confused with a road .
anyway , it &apos;s been many hours
since our scheduled appointment time .
again , it &apos;s blake with a b ,
the purchaser of the giant hand .
bye .
they &apos;re not coming , are they ?
i don &apos;t know , karen . i left a message .
what are you gonna do with ?
what am i gonna do with the giant watch ?
i don &apos;t know .
i , i don &apos;t plan for failure .
have you tried planning for success ?
does everything you do to this family have .
no . finish your thought .
finish your thought .
does everything have to do with me ,
purchasing oversize items on the internet .
but , that &apos;s not what this is really about , is it ?
it &apos;s not about a giant hand , or a giant watch .
please don &apos;t .
it &apos;s about a normal sized son .
who disappeared and it &apos;s all my fault ,
because i gave him a giant kite !
yes , how could you not make that connection ?
why do you continue to buy
giant size versions of everyday objects ,
when they are the reason our son is
disappeared !
disappeared .
they never found his body on the ground ,
which proves he &apos;s still up there waiting .
he &apos;s waiting for a better daddy ,
with a bigger hand .
oh , really ?
so then why the watch ?
i thought it would look really cool .
i &apos;m gonna walk the dog , and eventually leave you .
i &apos;ll put the watch in the garage .
and probably stop showering .
did you get any of that ?
yahoo !
