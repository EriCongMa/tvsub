for the love of mack daddy ,
why can &apos;t you be cool ?
shut it !
you &apos;re in my house now .
calm down , sir ,
your house is clearly a lost and found .
and it &apos;s all just baby shoes ...
and babies don &apos;t even need shoes .
why not put that money towards something worthwhile
like a cute hat or a raincoat ?
a baby in a raincoat .
it &apos;s like ... just like a ...
a little baby meteorologist .
hey , so , it &apos;s this simple , okay .
we wanted to pay for the bread maker ,
but they wouldn &apos;t let us pay for it
because it was a floor model ,
so we had a plan ...
i don &apos;t care .
baby in a raincoat .
this is bad , you guys . this is really bad !
he &apos;s gonna call the real cops
and i &apos;m gonna be in so much trouble .
i could lose my job ...
or worse ...
... they put me on train duty .
i &apos;m so sorry we got you in this situation , okay .
i am so sorry , too .
okay , how do we get out of here ?
how , how ? before the cops come .
yes , okay , guys ,
here &apos;s how we get out of here .
we dress up in the clothes from the lost and found ,
and we start crying ,
and then he comes back in and he &apos;s like ,
&quot; where are the girls ? this is just babies in here . &quot;
you &apos;re incredibly high .
no .
yeah .
no .
no . no .
yeah .
yeah .

you .
you , babe .
how did you know ?
oh , i knew from the first second i saw you .
like , literally the first second .
okay , ideas , you , go .
oh , no , no , no , i am not giving you any ideas
because it was my idea that got us into this mess
in the first place .
first ...
i bashed schmidt &apos;s $ 1,200 bread maker .
$ 1,200 ?
yeah .
for a bread maker ?
i know .
that &apos;s a lot of dough .
i &apos;m trying to wink .
am i winking ?
then i got my best friend here
to commit a crime ,
and now you might have ... train duty ?
it &apos;s like marathon duty but without the hot guys
pooping their pants .
what does that say about me
if i can &apos;t even take care of a bread maker ?
what if louise was right ?
what if i can &apos;t take care of schmidt ?
how can you say you don &apos;t take care of people ? !
you &apos;ve been taking care of me my entire life .
you &apos;re fierce and you are strong ,
and you would stand up for anyone that you love .
you &apos;re like a big , scary mama bear .
i &apos;m gonna jackass into these melons !
i &apos;m okay .
you are my mama bear , girl .
i wish i had someone in my life
who cared about me the way you guys care about each other .
oh , don &apos;t .
you do . i just ...
i &apos;ve been a cop for five years and ...
you do .
jessica !
... i just wanted to celebrate it ,
but then tripp had to leave
to meet an owl for sushi .
an owl he sent a basket of mice
to at christmas who
i &apos;m pretty sure has a nicer house than me .
let me tell her ... please !
i &apos;ll blame it on being stoned .
stoned ?
you &apos;re stoned ?
that makes this a drug case .
okay , yeah , you have no idea
what you &apos;re talking about .
wait , no , i made a mistake .
you better get comfortable ,
you &apos;re gonna be here for a long time , lady !
a long time !
oh , you little ...
power trip ...
trash guard !
you know what ?
this is over !
the only way you are gonna get to her
is if you go through me ,
and you are not getting through me .
mama bear .
