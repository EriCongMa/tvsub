aw , geez . well , i got news for ya ,
fox ain &apos;t doin &apos; this again .
how &apos;d you get so many more valentines ?
i got one from lisa
and one from my optometrist .

maybe we should just watch tv .
血腥玫瑰与暴力
now , son ,
you know itchy and scratchy give you night terrors .
last night you had the night terrors .
yeah , i dreamt i got fired from that job
i dreamt i got the night before .
welcome to mythcrackers ,
where we debunk rumors , legends ,
and all religions except the jesus @-@ based ones .
it &apos;s a beautiful afternoon .
no tv .
luckily , she doesn &apos;t know that our viewing platforms
are ... multi .
no tv on the computer !
no tv on a smart phone !
tonight , we take on the classic myth
that a cat will always land on its feet .
now , we didn &apos;t want to hurt a real cat ,
so we took this build @-@ a @-@ bear carcass ...
stuffed it with ballistic gel ,
shot it with a 20 foot barrel steam cannon ...
and made a scatter plot of the remains !
what was it we trying to prove again ?
don &apos;t know , don &apos;t care !
blow it up .
hey , bart , why don &apos;t we become myth crackers ?
i bet those guys get so many valentines .
that might be a good idea ,
but then again , you thought it up .
eh , why not ?
okay , first myth ,
using a cell phone at a gas station is dangerous .
well , at least i &apos;m cool now !
why does the guy have to do everything
for the girl on valentine &apos;s day ?
we show girls love on valentine &apos;s day ,
and they let us blow stuff up on the fourth of july .
i just pray they never fall on the same day .
homie , read this .
&quot; my darling husband .
&quot; this valentine &apos;s day ,
i have a present for you . &quot;
thanks for reading it to me .
my pleasure .
&quot; i want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff .
don &apos;t worry about me , i &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
oh , marge , this is brilliant !
i just think we should do things every day
to show our love for each other .
it &apos;s okay , homie .
go . have a good time .
take bart with you .
oh , which one do you want ?
you have the most wonderful mom in the world ,
which is why i have no idea
where she is or what she &apos;s doing .
that &apos;s right , sucker !
it &apos;s valentine &apos;s day ,
and i &apos;ve got a date with some fastballs !
lucky bastard .
i mean , my darling ,
i was looking at myself in the side view mirror .
i hope you hit one off the handle and your hands sting !
lisa , i love spending mother @-@ daughter time with you .
we have so much in common . like , um ...
oh , no !
someone &apos;s about to put the thousand island ladle
into the vinaigrette !
《 永别了 武器 》
sorry , sorry . i didn &apos;t mean to be nosey .
don &apos;t apologize .
it was dark , then a light came through the crack .
the light was you .
oh ... you have a way with words .
words are just nails we use to build ideas .
care to continue this discussion at the dessert table ?
mom , i &apos;m gonna look at the desserts !
don &apos;t panic . this can be separated out .
quick , does anyone have a centrifuge ? !
all i wanted was one romantic night .
yep , you &apos;re the crack head .
what dessert are you gonna get ?
i &apos;ll toss this fork into the air
and wherever it lands , that &apos;s what i &apos;ll eat . hiya !
as hemingway said ,
&quot; the shortest answer is doing the thing . &quot;
um , i should probably get back to my mom .
by the way , my name is ...
no ! when i first hear your name ,
i want to be somewhere important ,
the peak of kilimanjaro ...
the back of a vaporetto in venice , the ...
lisa ! now this is the most important place in the world .
now that &apos;s a spicy meet @-@ cute ! mwah !
lisa ?
hey , midge .
want a piece of my ziti ?
that cost a nickel , but , uh , we &apos;ll settle up later .
today we tackle the most terrifying myth
in the history of springfield elementary ,
that if you press e @-@ 8 on the candy machine ,
you get electrocuted and die .
did you invent a robot hand to touch the buttons ?
something like that .
ladies and gentlemen , that myth is cracked !
candy cigarettes ?
i didn &apos;t know they made these .
they were discontinued because they were thought
to encourage impressionable children to smoke .
how dumb do they think we are ?
i can quit any time i want !
this place is great !
if i cover my peripheral vision ,
i feel like i &apos;m in france .
how &apos; bout i just look at you .
el puerco , i must break up with you .
oh , but the hand @-@ holding is just too good .
your juice boxes .
it &apos;s ... nice .
perhaps we can try a little harder , for the lady .
such is the life of the juice boxier .
marge , since you &apos;re by yourself ,
would you like to borrow one of my twins ?
but remember , the one you pick may not be the one you get .
mom , i &apos;m sorry i &apos;m late .
no excuse , i just forgot all about you .
i &apos;m not sure that patch really represents who i am right now .
well , if you &apos;d been here for the design phase ,
you could &apos;ve registered that objection .
now start quilting !
now there &apos;s three of you ?
or maybe you &apos;re losing your mind .
according to the wisdom of our elders ...
... if you go all the way around on the swing ,
your body will turn inside @-@ out !
cool ! now my beauty will be on the outside !
he &apos;s still inside @-@ in , folks !
and just to prove it ...
&quot; she had now come to the part that peter pan hated .
&apos;i do like a mother &apos;s love , &apos; said tootles ... &quot;
mom , i have a crush !
is it on your father ?
little girls always get crushes on their fathers .
somehow i missed that phase .
almost there , boy . almost there .
almost there . i &apos;m getting closer .
it &apos;s just within reach .
the boy i like is hemingway esque !
okay . let &apos;s &quot; esque &quot; him to dinner .
wow , nick here in our house !
i hope it doesn &apos;t make him think less of me .
this house is not an embarrassment !
hm , usually when i say something like that ,
something extremely embarrassing happens .
i &apos;m gonna say good night before it does . good night .
well , lisa didn &apos;t tell me that she had a sister .
or a daughter .
oh , my .
i don &apos;t know if anyone &apos;s ever kissed my hand before .
well , your arms are lanky .
it &apos;s kind of a long trip down there .
my mother said i should bring some wine .
hmm , the french have gotten into the wine game ?
ha , good luck catchin &apos; up with the big boys .
i &apos;ll get a couple glasses .
mrs. simpson , i &apos;d like your permission to take your daughter
to the doritos nutrition fair at the school gym .
well , i usually take lisa ,
but i can just go with bart.
wait . what ? no !
you &apos;re going with me !
but , lisa , after this ,
i don &apos;t want you to spend so much time with this boy .
if you do , it &apos;ll mean you &apos;re a separate person from me .
that &apos;ll stop her from seeing him .
mom can &apos;t appreciate the kind of boy nick is ,
because although i love dad ,
he &apos;s a completely different creature .
yeah , there &apos;s a lot of fish in the sea ,
but she picked out a drunken walrus .
but you and this nick fella sound to me
like the story of pyramus and thisbe .
which inspired romeo and juliet ,
which inspired west side story ,
which inspired me to say &quot; eh . &quot;
pyramus and thisbe were lovers from ancient times !
they lived next door but their families despised each other .
i don &apos;t like to babble on , but i sure do like babylon .
the lovers had to whisper their sweet nothings
through a crack in the wall .
wait a minute !
nick and i met talking through a crack between two booths !
and the power of that forbidden smooch
made them love each other forever .
皮拉缪斯和忒斯彼
man , that company thinks every time
it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story ,
they own it .
talk to the wing , thisbe !
grampa , would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission ?
let me check my schedule .
this might work .
i think i &apos;m free .
tuesday &apos;s open .
you got it , kiddo !
legend has it a girl named eleanor mackie
drowned on this very spot .
now they say if you call her name three times
while looking in this mirror , you will die .
milhouse ?
eleanor mackie . eleanor mackie .
eleanor mackie !
aw , gimme a break .
the one day the lunch lady decides to wash her hands .
okay , that was the last school myth
and it &apos;s officially cracked .
so , school is just everything we see ?
that &apos;s sad , man .
you into cigars now ?
it &apos;s a twix .
i can &apos;t be the guy who killed everybody &apos;s fun .
that &apos;s skinner &apos;s job .
don &apos;t blame me . you killed the fun ,
fun @-@ killer .
milhouse , i &apos;ve just figured out a way to make school cool again .
american girl doll day ? !
you might be surprised at
the number of boys who have american girl dolls .
it &apos;s not weird &apos; cause they &apos;re historic figures .
i have found one last myth to destroy ,
the so @-@ called legend of groundskeeper were @-@ willie .
prepare to be disappointed !
gentlemen , we just created a myth .
now there &apos;s a myth about me i &apos;d like you to correct--
i &apos;m not from edinburgh !
i &apos;m also not from glasgow !
i &apos;m from kirkwall in orkney !
me father was an uppie , and me mother was a doonie .
it tore the family apart !
pull over .
you &apos;re wanted for grand theft retirement home .
the tv remote is in your pocket !
hola ! yo soy maury povich .
uno de estos siete hombres es
el verdadero padre de este &quot; crack baby . &quot;

but , if we stop now , we &apos;ll never make it there by sunset .

i &apos;ll take care of the cops !
but , grampa

i ain &apos;t afraid of no prison !
sir , we &apos;re gonna bring you back to your retirement home .

chief , we heard gunfire !
relax ! it &apos;s just my back !
and my hip .
spinal column !
thanks for the ride , mr. spuckler .
yeah , i don &apos;t normally approve of out @-@ breeding ,
but you two seem nice .
we can take this boat .
i don &apos;t know , this water &apos;s a little choppy .
i thought you rowed up the zambezi without a guide .
right , right .
so , dad , what kind of stupid idea did you put in lisa &apos;s head ?
she wants to steal a kiss , like pyramus and thisbe .
did you say &quot; ultimate frisbee &quot; ? !
no !
women and shoes , am i right ?
your hands are really cold .
you know , you were a lot more
adventurous at the dessert table .
i sure was-- i &apos;m allergic to chocolate !
shut up and kiss me .
lisa , it &apos;s hadley richardson ,
hemingway &apos;s first wife .
trust me , you &apos;re making a big mistake .
if you don &apos;t believe me , ask pauline pfeiffer .
i was his second wife .
there were two more after me .
tortured writers make horrible husbands .
at least you chose to be with him .
i was just swimmin &apos;along , mindin &apos; my own business .
next thing i know , i was hanging on his wall !
he used to pee in the fireplace !
wait , how long is this love for again ?
eternity .
oh , that &apos;s a pretty long time .
now my lips are getting cold .
lisa !
this isn &apos;t working out .
lisa , i &apos;m sorry that god gave me this gift
of lying to girls , for a little while .
i &apos;ll see ya .
i feel kinda silly i walked all the way out here .
you &apos;re just fine . you always are .
thanks . but i couldn &apos;t do it , mom .
i mean , the person you kiss under a mulberry tree
is someone you &apos;ll love for the rest of your life .
don &apos;t worry , ladies , i &apos;m @-@ a comin &apos; !
ooh , you know , i &apos;ve heard if a fat guy stops moving , he floats .
