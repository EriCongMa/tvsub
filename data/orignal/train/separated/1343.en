Exterior's well-kept.
Yard's in good shape.
Cleaners need to be brought in for full top-to-bottom service.
There's a strong, musty odor that needs to be investigated.
Possible leak.
Power in the basement is out.
Probably just a breaker.
No visible signs of water damage.
Odor is significantly stronger down here,
Where there is a...
wine room.
Approximately 15 by --
Hi, there.
Tasha?
She's okay.
She had a very good surgeon,
and she came through with flying colors.
I wouldn't move around too much.
Your spleen, kidneys, and liver are bruised.
The baby?
I'm so sorry, Jane.
I'm sure that...
I don't...
Yeah.
Everyone's been by --
Frankie, Tommy, Korsak.
And your mom's been here the whole time.
She just went home to take a shower.
She's gonna be very upset you woke up when she was gone.
I'll fake sleeping when I hear her coming.
What is that?
A baseball bouquet from Jack.
They're all Grover Verben.
It's his great-uncle. Jack has hundreds of them.
So he didn't pay $500 for the...
No.
He thought you could give them out
as "Thanks for visiting" gifts.
That's a very...odd idea.
I know.
You guys are perfect for each other.
Dr. Isles.
Okay, go ahead and take the photographs
and ask a technician to collect the vitals.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Okay. Yes, I'll talk to you soon.
Maura -- - I know what you're going to say.
I have a job to do.
You have a job to do.
Go to the crime scene.
I'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
I'm sure you will.
But that person isn't gonna be any less dead
if I wait just for a little bit.
A panda needs to consume --
Find your true love.
Here's a special important --
Hi, sweetheart.
I know you're faking.
What, did you go to a carnival?
Isn't it adorable?
It's...big.
It's a "Hug me tight" Teddy Bear.
I wanted you to have something to hold when I'm not here.
I thought you might be hungry. I made you a sandwich.
White bread and cheese.
It's what you always wanted
when you stayed home sick from school.
I was thinking more hot wings.
No.
How about a little Gin rummy?
I don't know, ma.
Afraid I'll beat you?
You haven't beaten me since I was in grade school.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna take advantage
of your weakened state.
All right.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Yeah? How do you know that?
Because I've been there.
What does that mean?
I had a miscarriage about a year before you were born.
Oh, ma, I never knew that.
I kept it to myself. That's what we did.
Was pop there for you?
I think it was hard for him to understand how I felt.
How did you feel?
Sad.
Devastated.
I was also confused.
I-I couldn't understand
how I could have such a sense of loss
for something that I never really had.
I think you should share how you're feeling with somebody.
Yes.
I just don't think I'm ready to talk about it yet.
You'll know when the time is right.
Come on. Play cards with me.
I'm feeling very lucky.
Jane's doctor said she should be able
to leave the hospital by the end of the week.
How are her spirits?
Well, when I left,
she made me promise to call her and fill her in on the case.
Sounds like she's already feeling better.
I hope so.
You were right.
This body is beautifully preserved.
I don't think I said "Beautifully."
I'm pretty sure I compared her to beef jerky.
And this is the perfect environment to preserve it --
cool, dry,
just like the Egyptians created for their mummies.
I never understood why they went to all the trouble.
So their eternal spirits could recognize
their earthly bodies after death.
Why couldn't they just keep it simple and wear funny hats?
I don't think simple was their objective.
They went to great lengths for their preparations.
For instance, did you know that the brain was pulled out
through the nasal passages with a special hooked wire?
No.
Kind of wish I didn't know it now.
Well, there are no visible external injuries --
No entrance wounds, blunt-force trauma,
or blood loss.
No, and nothing we found in the house points to foul play.
Makes me wonder if she died of natural causes.
With this much decay,
how long will it take to make a determination?
Well, it took me five seconds.
This woman didn't die of natural causes.
She was poisoned.
she looks like I feel after sitting at my desk all day.
Maybe you need to get up and stretch more often.
Duly noted.
Any idea how long she's been dead?
Well, it's difficult to say.
More than 2 years, less than 10.
Is that based on the dryness of the corpse?
No -- the collar of her shirt.
That was a very popular style in the mid-aughts.
Huh. Who says fashion doesn't have a place in forensics?
Certainly not me.
You gonna be able to tell what poison was used
with her tissue samples?
No.
Uh, even though the skin was intact,
the organs inside the body liquefied
and, over time, turned to dust.
So we're screwed?
Not quite.
The diptera larvae -- the maggots --
they feasted on the victim's flesh,
died of the same poison before they morphed into flies.
So you are...?
Making a maggot milkshake.
I've collected the maggots' tissue, casings, and feces,
so I can extract trace elements of poison.
I hope you didn't bring that blender from home.
What?!
I said I hope --
Never mind.
This is a nice room.
You can rest, watch baseball on TV...
...play along with the game shows.
You suck at small talk.
I don't know what to say.
You okay?
I'm fine.
Really -- you don't have to worry about me.
What kind of brother would I be if I didn't worry about you?
Oh, Janie.
I'm so sorry.
What can I do?
Why don't you tell me about the case?
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Our victim's name is Fran Clark,
38 years old, single female.
Cause of death was poisoning.
Did you figure out when she died?
4.1/2 years ago.
What?
One day, she's using her phone and credit cards.
The next day, she wasn't.
How did the body stay undetected for that long?
All of her bills are on autopay,
her lights are on timers,
mail went to a P.O. Box,
a gardener takes care of her yard.
She didn't have anybody that noticed she was missing?
No friends, family, co-workers?
No, the neighbors said she kept to herself.
And according to some messages I found
on her answering machine from her stepfather,
She and her mother were estranged.
I'd love to hear those messages.
I thought you'd say that.
Fran, it's Hhoward.
I'm calling again because the cancer's gotten worse.
You two have to patch things up before it's too late.
He left her another message after the mother passed away.
Fran, your mother died this morning.
The funeral's on Wednesday.
I know you two had trouble, but come and say goodbye.
I don't want you to regret it later.
Any sign that she went?
I guess we'll find out. The stepfather's coming in.
Hey. What are you doing back so soon?
Well, I figured out what kind of poison was used,
and I figured you were dying to know.
It was hemlock.
As in ancient greece?
Well, the way that she died -- alone --
poisoned by something that no one's used
since Socrates killed himself 2,000 years ago...
You should have Korsak ask the stepfather
about Fran's mental health.
I'll call him.
Thanks for keeping me in the loop.
As if we have a choice.
Four years, and nobody noticed?
Not that we know of.
Poor thing.
So, Howard, you say you were married
to Fran's mother for six years.
Yeah.
What were she and her mother fighting about?
My wife never really wanted to talk about it.
I'm not sure I know anything that's gonna be helpful.
Look, we need to figure out what happened to Fran.
And although it's not what we would have wanted for her,
it's better to know the truth.
Are you sure there's nothing you can tell me?
Well, I hate to say this, especially now,
but I didn't like her.
She was mean, difficult. She broke her mother's heart.
I tried to bring them back together
when my wife was on her deathbed,
But after she passed away,
I never wanted to see Fran again.
I can understand that.
Frankly, I'm not surprised she died.
She never went outside, never got any exercise,
survived on frozen food, candy bars, red wine.
What about friends?
None that I knew of.
How about work?
On several financial filings,
she listed her occupation as "Freelance contractor."
She wrote computer code for banks,
but she never went to the office.
Man.
When you start talking about all this, this is so sad.
I bet there's not one person who misses her.
Do you think she was capable of taking her own life?
Maybe.
I hope not.
May I help you?
Uh, can I have Tasha Williams' room number, please?
Are you family?
Not exactly.
Then I'm sorry. Since Tasha's underage,
I can't give out her room number.
Okay.
Well, um, she's a witness in a homicide investigation,
so I need to know her room number
and everything related to her care.
Really?
Everything that Detective Rizzoli said is true.
Though she might have fudged some causal connections.
218.
I'll give you a few minutes, but then she needs her rest.
Thank you.
Oh. You like baseball?
Was Ted Kennedy a liberal?
Here.
Grover Verben, the lefty lion?
Yeah.
Why are you giving this to me?
Just my way of saying thanks.
For what?
For taking care of Tasha.
This is too much.
Dr. Yates to surgical step down.
Dr. Yates to surgical step down.
Tasha.
Um, this is Dr. Maura Isles,
who you spoke to on the phone.
Hello.
What's that thing?
That?
That is a "Hug me tight" Teddy bear.
You know, in case you get lonely.
I'm not really a hugger.
And that's not really a bear.
I didn't want to say anything, but she's right.
It's a panda -- ailuropoda melanoleuca.
Which literally translates
to "Black-and-white cat foot," not "Bear foot" --
More closely related to raccoons than to bears.
Yeah, I am afraid not.
A recent national science study of DNA concluded
that pandas are actually more closely related
to the spectacled bear of South Africa than to raccoons.
Maybe.
But their skull and dental structures don't resemble bears,
their feet don't have heel pads,
and they don't hibernate.
So if they are bears,
then they're all alone on their own little bear island.
So, we're agreed --
It's part panda, part bear,
part raccoon, part cat.
I'm not agreeing to that.
Jane, that is ridiculous.
Yes, it is -- absolutely ridiculous
that a stuffed animal could be genetically incorrect.
The real reason we're here
is to tell you that you're safe.
We got the guy that was after you.
I...wasn't really worried.
I'm sorry, ladies, but visiting time is over.
That wasn't a few minutes.
Our patient needs her rest.
See you later.
Jane.
Yeah?
Thank you for helping me.
You're welcome.
Frankie, what do you got?
We went back and combed through all the victim's
autopay accounts and found something strange.
Fran's gardener, Joe Martin, got a pay raise.
Six months after Fran died.
According to the bank, it was entered
from her regular I.P. address, using her password.
Hemlock is a plant-based poison.
And who knows more about plants than a gardener?
We found your fingerprints on Fran's computer.
You gave yourself a raise.
Anything else you helped yourself to?
Okay, look, I knew she was dead,
but I didn't kill her.
You knew she was dead?
Yes. I-I found her that way in the basement.
When?
Uh, four years ago-ish.
I went in to turn the sprinklers off for the winter,
and there she was.
She didn't look exactly like that,
But she was definitely dead.
So you just forgot to tell someone about it?
I should have, but I was low on cash,
So I just figured that I'd wait
for the next autopay money to go through.
Then one thing led to another, and...I didn't.
So you could keep collecting the payments?
I figured somebody else would find her.
And since she was dead, you thought
you'd just help yourself to her bank accounts?
No.
Look...a few months after I found Fran,
my girlfriend kicked me out.
So I moved into the room above the garage.
A-and occasionally, I'd go into the house.
And her password was right there by her computer.
So I gave myself a raise because I deserved it.
I'd been doing lots of extra work around the house --
You know, since she couldn't.
Unbelievable.
If you think I killed her for the money,
then why didn't I take more?
I had -- I had plenty of time to steal everything.
I liked Fran.
She was nice to me.
Did you see anyone else at the house before she died?
Well, there -- there was this one guy
I saw a couple of times.
He's a skinny white dude with a beard.
So, can I go now?
No.
We're gonna leave you here and see if somebody finds you.
Detective Rizzoli,
This is Cathy Graff, Tasha's social worker.
I informed her you needed to be kept in the loop,
uh, since Tasha is a witness in one of your cases.
Yes, um...
We -- we just need to know what social services' plan are
so BPD can maintain contact with her.
Well, we always like to place children with a family,
but because of Tasha's age and years on the street,
adoptive parents and foster families
will be suspicious of drugs,
prostitution, emotional difficulties.
Well -- well, she doesn't have those problems.
Still, potential guardians may be suspicious.
Well, uh, you could spend five minutes with her,
and you know she's a good kid.
That may be true, but this is a complex situation.
There is nothing complex about it. It's very simple.
This is a girl who needs love, guidance, and rules.
I have a girl just like Tasha
who is a thriving college freshman.
I'm not saying it's right.
I'm just telling you it's the reality of the system.
The likelihood is that Tasha will be placed
in a group home with girls of a similar age.
That sucks.
I'm sorry.
I'll call you when we have a placement.
How long is Tasha supposed to stay in the hospital?
A week -- 10 days tops.
Thank you.
Hey, Korsak.
I talked to several of the gardener's customers.
They said he was honest, reliable,
trustworthy, heck of a good guy.
I've been through all of Fran's bank records.
Nothing else is missing.
All he took was the extra $25 a month.
Well, with the password,
he could have cleaned out her accounts.
Okay, so maybe he didn't kill her,
but not telling anyone she was dead
probably disqualifies him from the "Heck of a good guy" award.
I tested the wine residue on the glass
that we found next to the victim.
"The wine that evaporated from that glass
"was a cheap domestic table wine
without a trace of hemlock in it."
How's that possible?
The killer could have put poison in her glass,
then poured it out when she was dead,
then cleaned the glass and replaced the good wine
with a cheap one he brought with him.
There were 500 bottles of wine in that cellar.
Why bring a cheap bottle
when you could just open one that was already there?
Wine collectors often keep lists of their inventory online.
Perhaps the killer was concerned
that the bottle would be noticed as missing.
Well, at least we finally know one thing for sure --
somebody concocted an elaborate scheme
to make it look like Fran died of natural causes.
All we have to do is figure out why.
How's the mutant?
A bit lumpy,
anatomically incorrect, and highly flammable.
Social services came by today.
I know. She came and talked to me.
I told her I can take care of myself.
Yes, you can.
And you have.
But now that someone like me is involved,
you can't do it by yourself -- not anymore.
I don't need your help.
That's not the point.
Look, when you turn 18, you can do whatever you want.
But until then, we have to find you someplace to live.
No one wants a kid like me.
Tasha.
If you think that you can stick me
in some crappy group home, then you're wrong.
I'll run away again.
And this time, you won't find me.
The password we got from the gardener
also worked on Fran's smartphone.
Remember what the gardener said?
That her only friend was a skinny white dude with a beard.
The firewall is for my protection, Bill.
It gives me a say in how things are done.
But nothing's getting done, because you've locked me out!
Well, I guess now you'll have to listen to me.
Listen, you little bitch,
if you don't take that damn firewall down,
I'll kill you.
Don't push me.
The only thing the gardener got wrong about this guy
was that they were friends.
If you don't take that damn firewall down I'll kill you.
I didn't mean kill kill her.
What kind of kill did you mean?
You know, the funny kind.
I'm not laughing.
Look, Fran and I worked together at the bank.
She wrote code. I had an idea for an app.
We got into an argument.
She locked me out of the program.
I-I got pissed. That's all you see there.
Look, I found her like that. I had nothing to do with it.
You found her?
What? No. Uh...
Frankie, we should just let this guy keep talking.
He's doing a fine job of hanging himself.
Bill.
We now have a recording of you saying "I found her,"
which puts you on the scene.
Her financial stake in the app gives you motive.
And the nuance of "I didn't do it"
is something a jury might not care about.
After the fight on the video,
I knew that we couldn't work together.
So I offered her some royalty payments
in exchange for notes on code.
It actually worked for a few weeks.
Then she stopped sending me notes.
So you went to her house?
Well, not at first, but after four months,
I started to think that she was mad at me,
That -- that she might sue me for breach of contract.
That's when I went by.
And found a dead woman in her basement.
Did it dawn on you to call someone?
I did.
Who?
I made an anonymous phone call to the police.
And?
Nothing happened.
So you figured, if no one knew she was dead,
no one would know that you owed her money?
Yes.
Why did it take you four months to check in?
I thought Fran was busy doing other things.
And it's not like she needed my money.
What do you mean?
She had money -- a lot of it.
Her inheritance.
That guy was telling the truth about the welfare call.
Police got an anonymous call, went by the house to check.
Everything looked fine. No one answered the door.
Well, hard for a mummy to run to the door.
How about the inheritance?
Fran's mom had less than $90,000 in net assets when she died.
She gave it to the stepdad.
But Fran's father died seven years ago.
There are no court records of a will,
and his lawyer is dead,
But he had almost a million dollars in property
at the time of his death.
No other relatives?
None that I've found.
Well, that money had to go somewhere.
We can't find any sign that it went through Fran's accounts.
What'd she do -- turn her dad's estate
into "die hard" bearer bonds and hide them in the mattress?
And we need to dig into her background,
starting from when her father died.
Somebody knew she'd gotten a pot of gold.
We have to figure out who it is.
How are you feeling today?
Well, I've beaten my mother 30 consecutive times,
So...pretty good.
Yeah. She's cheating. I just don't know how.
Well, I spoke to your doctor,
and he says you're being a very good patient.
Yeah.
I'm hoping for early parole based on good behavior.
Gin.
Have you checked under her pillow for a secret deck?
Whose side are you on?
Mine.
Rizzoli.
What?
Okay.
I'll be right there.
You're supposed to stay in bed!
Jane, your mother is right.
You cannot be getting out of bed.
Ple-- Jane.
Jane, where are you going?
Fran bought a plane ticket
two months after her father's death.
Plenty of time to get control of her inheritance.
Where was she headed?
The Caymans. She stayed 24 hours.
If you're on vacation, you stay longer than that.
It's a stop-and-drop.
Yeah. And I found the hotel.
The room was comped by the Grand Cayman National Bank.
How are we gonna get a subpoena for an offshore bank?
Got to get a federal judge and some evidence
of a violation of international banking law.
It's not gonna be easy.
Is it still wire fraud if you don't actually send the money?
Thank you for calling Grand Cayman National Bank.
How can I help you?
I need my account balance,
but it's kind of embarrassing --
I've forgotten my account number.
What's the name and the address on the account?
Fran Clark. 2020 Bingham Drive, Boston.
Your password, please?
7, 9, capital "G," 2, 0, "P," hashtag, 11.
At today's current rate of exchange,
the balance in that account is $878,529.17.
is there anything else I can do f you, Ms. Clark?
No. Thank you.
And that's why you shouldn't have
the same password for all your accounts.
How long has she been gone?
I don't know.
What about the security cameras?
I've got people watching every door,
and we've reviewed the
tapes from every exit since she was last seen.
There's been no sign of her.
Okay, can you check the stairwells,
unoccupied rooms, and -- and supply closets?
We're looking everywhere.
You need to check all the delivery services
and see if they had trucks here at the hospital.
She could have climbed inside one of those.
I'll get someone on it.
Thank you.
Korsak is sending patrol units to search around the hospital.
I spooked her.
No, you were trying to help.
Same result.
Look, there are a lot of people looking for her.
She won't get far.
Should we go back to your room?
No.
And -- and -- and you got to get back to work.
No, I-I-I don't.
Yeah, you do. Go.
Okay. I'll come back tonight?
Okay.
How'd you find me?
Well, it was pretty smart --
knowing that security would be watching the doors.
Stay hidden down here until they stopped.
You're good at your job aren't you?
Most days.
Not today,
when I came to talk to you about social services.
I need to get a doctor to check you out,
make sure you're okay.
I'm okay.
That's not exactly the medical assessment I was hoping for.
Look...
out on the street, I've kept my grades up.
If I could just...
If I could just graduate high school,
I could get a job,
maybe go to college.
But if I get stuck in some group home,
it'll be impossible.
Tasha...
I'm not gonna let some group home full of girls
screw up your GPA.
I promise.
But I need you to trust me.
Please.
I'm not gonna let you down, baby.
I can't find anyone who knew about the inheritance.
What about the stepfather?
Said he couldn't help.
He married the mom after Fran got the money.
But I called the neighbors,
trying to find someone who knew her mom back then.
Any luck?
Yeah, the lady down the block said
that she and Fran's mom were good friends.
She told me what a wonderful woman she was
and that it was a real shame --
she looked like she was getting better, then died suddenly.
Suddenly? I thought she died of cancer.
Well, that's what we heard.
I called her doctor. He wouldn't talk to me.
Did you have better luck?
The threat of an official visit
from the medical examiner works every time.
Yeah. Who wants you sitting in their waiting room, right?
No. Not -- not you.
It's -- it's -- it's the office.
Okay. I get it. I get it. - It's -- it's -- it's --
So, our victim's mother had stage IV lung cancer.
When traditional drugs failed,
she was accepted into a trial for a new A.L.K. inhibitor.
It worked.
She went into remission, and the doctor thought
that she would have a meaningful recovery.
But she didn't?
No. She died unexpectedly two weeks later.
Was there an autopsy?
Since she was a cancer patient and under a doctor's care,
there was no autopsy,
and her husband had her cremated the next day.
So the stepfather killed the mom, too?
First, he killed Fran,
thought he'd get all the money when his wife died.
But then her remission meant she wasn't dying fast enough,
so he felt like he didn't have any choice.
Well, I don't know what you were thinking.
If your stitches had opened up, you could have bled to death
before Detective Rizzoli had found you.
But I didn't.
By the grace of God.
But since you've shown that you clearly don't have any sense,
we're gonna have to keep an eye on you night and day.
Careful.
Take your meds.
Cathy, it's Detective Jane Rizzoli.
Uh, we were talking about Tasha Williams.
Yes, um, I have a question.
What does it take
for a single woman to become a foster parent?
I guess if you have a reclusive step daughter
and a dying wife, that 800 grand seems like easy pickings.
Ah, what are the odds of two people tripping over
the same body and not doing anything about it?
Well, if he hadn't have killed his wife,
we might never have known.
The problem is, we can't prove any of it.
What if we got the wife's ashes? Would that have forensic value?
Cremation requires temperatures in excess of 1,100 degrees,
and that destroys DNA,
so even if you could detect some pathogen,
you wouldn't be able to say it came from the mother's body.
We'll just have to just keep grinding away at it.
We'll get something, eventually...hopefully.
That "hopefully" made you sound a little less confident.
Can I have pizza?
Yes, when the doctor clears you for solid foods.
I had a sandwich today.
Your mother?
Yeah.
Well, I hope it was delicious,
because if it causes a blockage, you will not be happy.
I got it.
A blockage?
No.
An idea of how to throw a monkey wrench into Howard's plan.
Mr. Ames.
Thanks for coming in.
Of course.
We're done with our investigation,
and we've concluded that Fran was poisoned.
There's no evidence to suggest
that it was at someone else's hand,
so...
We think she committed suicide.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Our investigation is done, but you'll likely be contacted
by an investigator from Grand Cayman Bank.
The Caymans?
She had an account there.
Well, what do they want to talk to me about?
We can't officially close our investigation
because we couldn't find any financial or chemical evidence
that Fran was in possession of the poison.
Cayman law requires a clear cause of death
before they'll allow transfer of assets to an estate.
Because we can't provide one,
their policy is to send in
their own investigator before they deny the transfer.
Okay.
I know you and your stepdaughter weren't close, but...
...I'm still very sorry for your loss.
So, they released you?
They did. They sent me home.
But the doctors still have me on a short leash.
And you get released at the end of the week.
Yep.
Well, you know, there's still that bit of business
that we need to take care of before I go --
that group-home thing.
I think we've found an alternative.
Social services has agreed
to allow Gwen to be your foster parent,
and she has graciously agreed to take you in.
I've got a daughter who's in college,
so I have the room and I have the time.
But there's gonna be some rules.
Rules?
For starters, you have to be home for dinner by 6:00,
unless we've agreed to something different.
Okay.
I'm gonna go...
...and let you guys work out the details.
I'll see you soon.
Bye, Jane.
Homework needs to be done before you surf the net or watch TV.
Of course.
And I know that you're old enough to date,
but only on the weekends and only if I've met them first.
Pre-dating interviews? What is this -- Guantanamo?
It's gonna be great.
You got greedy, Howard.
This isn't an active crime scene. You can't be here.
Actually, the bank owns the house,
and they said we could come in.
Technically, you're breaking and entering.
Frankie, you mind looking in that bag?
Look at this, Korsak.
He's trying to provide the investigators
with the evidence they need to prove Fran's suicide.
I'm sure you'll find traces of hemlock in that bag, too,
which would be okay, if we'd told you what killed her.
Read him his rights.
Howard Ames, you have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you
in a court of law.
Okay. I put your stuff in a drawer.
Thank you.
And I bought you some of that shampoo that you like --
you know, the one with all the fruity-smelling chemicals.
But you said that was like
washing my hair with dry-cleaning solution.
Yeah, but it's like fruity-smelling dry-cleaning solution.
It's in the green bathroom.
How's it taste?
It's...cold.
What? You're having a beer?
Well, you're choosing the menu tonight.
I actually like it.
Yeah, no. See, that's how it starts.
I will not be blamed
if you start chugging beers and belching the alphabet.
So, how are you doing?
How am I supposed to be doing?
I have no idea.
Yeah, me neither.
Who's that?
Probably your family.
I don't know if I'm ready for all of them
to pile in here and try to make me feel better.
I just wanted to relax
and feel like everything's heading back to normal again.
Okay. Well, I'll tell them.
I'm sure they'll understand.
Hail, hail. The gang's all here.
Hey! Hey, Janie.
We got pizza now. You can have pizza, right?
I forgot the key.
The game's already on, so we're gonna watch.
Look who I found!
Come on, get it on. What channel's it on here?
It's 12. It's 12. 4 or 12.
Janie, can you get me an opener?
Someone put lead in your shoes? No. Get it yourself.
Should I tell them to go?
We got anchovies.
You did not.
They look disgusting.
Yes!
Get in here.
