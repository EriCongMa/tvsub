第一季 第六集
if you want to be a part of this world , jenny ,
you need to decide if all this is worth it .
get off. stop .
hey ! that is my little sister !
bendel &apos;s is interested in carrying my line .
cause more people should be like you , mother .
eleanor waldorf is gearing up to take her company public ,
and i &apos;ve been courting her for months
to let me handle the deal .
then you should get it .
i will get it , if you just help me out a little bit .
spotted ... s. and lonely boy macking in the meat packing .
opposites do attract ,
but for how long ?
long ago , when european royals grew bored with palace balls ,
they took a page from the peons and added some pageantry .
couture and canap閟 are just another saturday night
until you add a mask ,
but preparing for a ball is an event in itself ,
which is why queens invented handmaidens .
so the dresses should be delivered ,
and i &apos;ll take the small stuff with me. which one &apos;s yours ?
oh , no . i &apos;m just helping blair ,
but i mean , you know , we &apos;ll see .
well , here &apos;s hoping .
we &apos;ll put it on blair &apos;s tab. oh , no , no , no .
the girls at that party are my best customers .
why not show off my latest wares ?
just return it after the ball .
so kati mentioned something about a custom @-@ made corset
and i hear there are wigs involved ?
it &apos;s a masquerade. you have to conceal your identity ,
but i do have something special planned for nate tonight .
it &apos;s a game. it &apos;s a scavenger hunt .
nate starts the night with a clue ,
which leads him to a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting ,
who gives him a clue to the next lady ... wait .
hold on. you have ladies now ?
if he finds me before midnight when the masks come off ,
he can claim his prize. and what &apos;s that ?
oh. yeah , right. sorry .
i just figured
that after everything that &apos;s happened ,
or hasn &apos;t happened ,
i should find some way to make it special .
well , that &apos;s really romantic , blair .
really .
look , um , if you don &apos;t want me to come tonight ,
i totally understand . i could just ...
what ? no , i want you to come .
in fact , i was hoping you would be one of my ladies .
would you give nate the last clue ?
are you sure you want me to ?
tonight is all about starting over .
i trust you ... and him .
well , then i will be honored to serve you , my queen .
well , besides , you &apos;re bringing dan , right ?
a ball ? haven &apos;t you heard ? your sister &apos;s cinderella .
and let me guess. your wicked stepsister is blair waldorf .
blair may have asked me to do a few things ,
but i &apos;m happy to help .
and if she happens to help you out with an invite and outfit ?
it &apos;ll all be worth it. everyone in disguise
in this old ballroom ... it &apos;s gonna be amazing. you know ,
i &apos;m actually surprised serena didn &apos;t mention it .
why ? we &apos;ve only been out twice .
it &apos;s not like all of a sudden ,
we have to do everything together .
all right , well i gotta go deliver this stuff .
let me know if you need me to pick you up a tux .
what ? it &apos;s a masked ball .
i &apos;m sure she thinks i &apos;d never go to something that pretentious ,
which shows she knows me well .
i know him. a masked ball ?
dan would never want to go to something that pretentious ,
where he has to wear a mask and a tux ?
he likes you. he would wear a tux and a mask
and one of my mother &apos;s dresses
if it meant that he could go out with you. come on .
what , are you worried that he already has a date ?
i mean , he is dan humphrey. shut up . i don &apos;t know .
i guess a masked ball is better than a regular party
because then all those kids from school that he hates ...
he won &apos;t even recognize them .
all right. invite him . i insist .
i &apos;m not saying i wouldn &apos;t go .
if serena asked me , i wouldn &apos;t deprive her of my company .
no , that would be too cruel .
but she hasn &apos;t asked me , so ...
if you want to go with her , just make it happen .
put yourself out there. this thing happens in a matter of hours .
the window for bold gestures is officially closed .
is that her ?
uh , no , it &apos;s vanessa .
vanessa ?
that &apos;s been a while .
you gonna answer that ? of course. why wouldn &apos;t i ?
hello ? vanessa .
hi. yeah , it &apos;s me .
so what &apos;s up ? what &apos;s up ? how &apos;s vermont ?
do you still have my copy of &quot; the crying of lot 49 &quot; ?
um , i don &apos;t know .
well , could you check ?
okay . i haven &apos;t talked to you in over a year ,
and you called to ask me about an old book ?
you know , it could be anywhere .
try over by the window .
vanessa. surprise !
what ? oh , my god .
so good to see you . i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re here .
what ... what are you doing here ?
my parents said i could live with my sister and finish high school in the city .
so ... so that means you &apos;re ...
i &apos;m back for good .
that is ... awesome , i hope ?
yeah , t @-@ totally. yes , of course .
it &apos;s just ... unexpected .
unexpectedly awesome .
go ahead. answer that . i &apos;m starving , and i smell waffles .
rufus. vanessa .
hi. serena , hey .
go ahead. do it .
uh , hey , i was just wondering ,
are you , uh , are you , uh , doing anything tonight ?
tonight ? no. no , nothing. why ?
good , because there &apos;s this thing ,
and you &apos;re probably gonna think it &apos;s stupid , but ... try me .
even cold , these are so good .
i @-@ i &apos;ve missed rufus &apos; cooking . i have .
rufus , do you have whipped cream ?
who &apos;s that ?
uh , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s my sister ,
but you ... you were saying something .
hi , blair. what do you want me to do with this stuff ? oh ,
just leave them over there . that &apos;s fine . i left you another list .
hello ? is anyone there ?
i &apos;m sorry. uh ... what ?
uh , you ... you were asking me something .
no , uh ...
no , never mind .
thank you. have a good day. okay .
bye .
so what are we doing tonight ?
i think i need a date .
damn it , anne , i told you no starch .
howard , we &apos;ve been going to the same cleaners for 19 years .
your shirts are exactly how they always are .
we both know this isn &apos;t about laundry .
i &apos;m sorry , but i need everything
to be perfect at eleanor &apos;s party tonight .
i can &apos;t screw up .
eleanor knows you &apos;re the best person
to take her company public. she &apos;s going to pick you .
just show up and be yourself .
look , i &apos;m gonna call you from the office .
i gotta look over the proposal one more time
hey , mom .
oh , nate .
is everything okay with dad ?
just work stuff. nothing for you to worry about .
sure .
god ! i love new york .
there was only one theater in woodbury ,
and all it ever played were family movies .
&quot; the pacifier &quot; played for , like , a year .
and they said vin diesel couldn &apos;t do comedy .
i can &apos;t pick. overwhelmed by choice .
whatever you want .
yeah , sure , whatever .
you do wanna do something , right ?
i mean , you don &apos;t have plans .
big night out with overprivileged , under @-@ parented
trust fund brats from your fancy school ?
yeah , the limo &apos;s actually waiting back at the loft .
good. we can egg it .
maybe slash the tires ?
so is it weird , having me back ?
no. why , uh , why ... why would it be weird ?
because we said some things the night that i left ...
things that you immediately asked me to take back .
because i was leaving , but ... now i &apos;m here .
yeah , and it &apos;s been over a year , you know ?
a lot has happened , actually .
and i look forward to hearing about it tonight .
late show. angelika ? whatever &apos;s playing ?
unless it &apos;s &quot; the pacifier . &quot; unless it &apos;s &quot; the pacifier . &quot;
all right . i &apos;ll get tickets .
glad to be home , humphrey .
glad to have you , abrams .
so what exactly are you looking for ?
evidence .
of what ?
the captain &apos;s dislike of starchy shirts ?
i totally sympathize. the collars chafe .
did you , uh , ask him about your missing college money ?
yeah , he said he was moving accounts around .
it was all back the next day. so why worry ?
mysterious financial transactions ,
warring parents. welcome to the upper east side .
&quot; chi chi , get the llello . &quot; nathaniel , i &apos;m shocked .
i thought you were strictly an herbal man .
this isn &apos;t mine .
who does this dan humphrey think he is ?
serena is putting up atrong front ,
but i can see how hurt she is .
we have to help her heal her heart. but it &apos;s pretty late notice .
most of the good ones are already taken .
no more excuses.serena must have the hottest date ever .
if he &apos;s got plans , he &apos;ll change them .
if he &apos;s got a girlfriend , he &apos;ll dump her ,
and if he &apos;s out of town , he &apos;ll charter a g5 and fly home .
make it happen .
do you like it ? that &apos;s outstanding .
is it a bong , mother ?
please . i didn &apos;t take you for a stoner .
it &apos;s a ... a hookah ... mm @-@ hmm .
and it is adorable. it &apos;s perfect for my moroccan @-@ themed party .
why do you have to celebrate your bendel &apos;s deal
by turning our penthouse into an opium den ?
why not ?
hey , it &apos;s blair .
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t come to the phone right now ,
but i &apos;m getting ready for the masked ball .
see you tonight , if you recognize me , which you won &apos;t .
hey , blair. it &apos;s me. i , um ...
i just ... i really need to talk to you .
it &apos;s , uh , there &apos;s this thing with my dad ,
and , um ...
you know , i just ... i really need to talk to you .
so can you call me back when you can ? thanks .
well , that &apos;s all of it. thank you so much .
i don &apos;t know what i would &apos;ve done without you .
that &apos;s okay. yeah , it was fun .
i &apos;m glad. it &apos;s all part of your education .
and it looks like you &apos;re learning. it &apos;s a nice bracelet .
vintage , right ? the diamonds look real .
cause they sort of are .
uh , the man at the store lent it to me .
why would he do that ?
oh ! oh , sweetie ,
you didn &apos;t think you were gonna be able to come tonight , right ?
i thought maybe , yeah .
jenny , freshmen don &apos;t get to go to the masked ball .
it &apos;s just tradition. no , i know. it &apos;s just that there were five dresses .
oh , it ... you always need backup .
i mean , what ... what if i spilled something or a zipper broke ?
yeah , of course . i &apos;ll ... i &apos;ll remember that .
have fun tonight .
i will , and don &apos;t worry ,
your time will come . i promise .
now if you &apos;ll excuse me , i have to get ready .
do you think that eleanor waldorf
will find this ... night in tangiers enough ?
maybe if you brought a goat .
you know , eleanor always goes all @-@ out .
speaking of going all @-@ out ...
yeah , i know. tell me about it . i don &apos;t think the waldorf women
ever met a theme they didn &apos;t just love .
you going with dan ?
um , no , dan has plans , actually. doing what ?
the question is &quot; with whom ? &quot;
oh , i didn &apos;t realize .
well , frankly , i am relieved .
you know , at your age , you should be playing the field .
what about at your age ? you got a hot date tonight ?
what ? no , please. who would i be dating ?
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go try this on
and see if i can find a goat .
well , he &apos;s no dan , but i guess he &apos;ll do .
hey , jen , you &apos;re not gonna believe this ,
but , uh , vanessa is back in town .
so we &apos;re going to a movie tonight ,
and i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to that ball or not ,
but i was wondering if you wanted to come with .
so , uh , we &apos;re getting tickets online. call me back .
why is it that friends of serena van der woodsen
haveo search for her suitor ?
have fables fallen so out of fashion
that the princesses have to do everything themselves ?
call us old @-@ school ,
but sometimes the fairy @-@ tale ending
requires the knight to get off his ass
and saddle up his steed .
maybe it &apos;s never too late for a bold gesture .
nate , hey .
what are you doing here ? i thought you were , um ,
shouldn &apos;t you be getting ready ?
i &apos;m sorry to bother you. it &apos;s , um , do you have a minute ?
yeah , of course .
come in .
thanks .
maybe it &apos;s old. you know , left over from the &apos; 90s or something ,
from some night at limelight or the tunnel ?
our parents did way worse stuff than we do .
it &apos;s not old , and it makes total sense .
i think he &apos;s having some money problems .
well , have you asked him about it ?
yeah .
i just wish , you know , i wish he &apos;d be honest with me .
it &apos;s like he and my mom ...
they made some secret pact to act like robots .
yeah , well , i don &apos;t think that pact is so secret .
i think all of our parents signed it .
but i &apos;m not a little kid anymore .
he doesn &apos;t have to shut me out .
look , if what you think is right ,
he &apos;s probably really scared .
maybe you have to tell him how you feel more than once
for him to really hear you , you know ?
hey , don &apos;t give up , okay ?
you should probably go .
you know , i &apos;ve gotta get ready and stuff .
yeah , me , too. um ...
look , thanks for just listening .
that &apos;s fine. yeah , don &apos;t worry about it .
chuck just wanted a bump , and blair &apos;s phone was turned off ,
so it , um , really means a lot . yeah , anytime , nate
i &apos;ll see you tonight , okay ?
all right . i &apos;ll see ya. bye .
hey , anybody home ?
hey , you and dan going out ?
just to the movies. what about you ?
a humphrey man in a sports coat ?
i &apos;d normally ask if you had a date , but ...
but my wife left me , hmm ?
yeah. what &apos;s up with alison ? dan says she &apos;s still upstate .
i thought that was just for the summer. so did her husband .
okay , we &apos;ll circle back to that .
one issue at a time. like where are my keys ?
what do you need keys for ? just use dan &apos;s window .
where is dan , by the way ?
uh , he should be back in a minute. hmm .
so , uh , dan seems happy to see you .
why wouldn &apos;t he be ?
well , um , if you don &apos;t mind me saying so ,
when you left here , you kind of broke his heart .
i &apos;m back , aren &apos;t i ?
i hated being away from the city ...
away from dan .
did you tell dan this ?
no , not yet , but i &apos;m planning on it tonight ...
before or after the movie . i &apos;m not sure yet .
you know , i gotta pick my moment .
it &apos;s kind of a big deal .
oh , thanks .
you know , there &apos;s , uh ,
a lot that &apos;s changed since you were here .
so dan says .
but you guys have always been close .
you &apos;ll figure it out .
wish me luck ?
me , too .
where are you going anyway ? uh , just some party .
with a friend ?
i wouldn &apos;t exactly call her that .
see ya .
hello ?
hey. where are you ? at your house .
oh. oh , you &apos;re early .
yeah , i just couldn &apos;t wait .
oh , um , i tried to get you before you left .
i @-@ i feel terrible .
cause i &apos;m early ?
no , because , um , i ... i totally spaced .
i have this , uh , american history paper
due monday .
so you know , i &apos;ll be writing all night .
i &apos;ll make it up to you , though . i promise .
pierogis at veselka ?
i &apos;ll call you tomorrow .
jenny , hey .
jenny , what &apos;s wrong ?
and how is this a favor to me again ?
rufus , look around. when was the last time you had access
to the top people in music and art ?
introduce yourself. revitalize your flagging career .
put that sad little gallery on the cultural radar .
since when were you the patron saint of former rock stars ?
since when were you a star ? no , look , leave if you want to .
really. alison would have a fit
if she knew you were accompanying me to this party ,
even if it was for your benefit .
actually , i don &apos;t care what alison thinks right now .
good. then let me introduce you to our hostess .
eleanor .
it is divine. squint , and it &apos;s marrakech .
lily .
i had no idea you were bringing a date .
how delightful. oh , this is rufus humphrey .
oh , it &apos;s not a date. oh , pleasure .
look. appetizers. is that couscous ?
yes , please .
bart !
and friend .
hi .
oh. mm. something catch your eye ?
oh , i like her outfit. lily .
bart.
hello .
hi .
i &apos;d like you to meet carissa. yeah , hi. carissa .
hi .
hi. rufus. hi , rufus .
yeah , hi. well , it &apos;s so good to see you .
great to see you. enjoy .
you , too. okay .
you and bart bass ? suddenly it all makes sense .
you brought me here to make him jealous. oh , don &apos;t be ridiculous .
i mean , it &apos;s flattering , i guess ,
but couldn &apos;t you have done a little better ? oh , not on such short notice .
eleanor , oh ! as @-@ salaamu alaikum .
oh ! how are you ? this is fantastic .
good bless you
so this blair girl used you as her slave ?
no , i was her handmaiden .
&quot; handmaiden &quot; is jane austen for &quot; slave . &quot;
she never actually said i would get to go to the ball ,
even if i did all those errands .
unh @-@ unh. don &apos;t make excuses for her .
you did all that stuff. you deserve to go .
i thought you said that masked balls are &quot; totally pretentious . &quot;
one woman &apos;s opinion
but if you wanna go ,
no blair should keep you away .
it &apos;s not just blair . i mean , i don &apos;t have a gown .
my friend works in the costume department at b.a.m.
we can borrow one. next ? i don &apos;t have an invitation .
every ballroom has a back door. what else ?
if blair saw me , she &apos;d be furious .
then it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;ll be wearing a mask .
on the upper east side ,
appearances are often deceiving .
from friends to hair color , there &apos;s always more than meets the eye .
is the town this way , or that way
it &apos;s , uh , that way ,
and these things whizzing by here ... they &apos;re cars .
you mighwant to avoid them. you know what ?
you &apos;ll see better without this , too. whoa. that is better .
hey , you got a name ?
jack altman .
hi. jack altman . i just stepped out for some air .
altman ? okay .
come on. thank you .
wait. let me see .
okay , look , i know you &apos;re completely morally opposed
to society events and stuff , but ...
we &apos;ll deprogram you later. this is ugly .
just go .
all right. thanks .
thank you so much .
what was it we said about appearances ?
yes , they can be deceiving .
but most of the time ,
what you see is what you get .
have you seen that girl i was with ?
when i grabbed her bag , i got her house keys , too .
what is nate doing ?
he &apos;s supposed to go find kati and is .
it &apos;s getting late , and i &apos;m losing heat. well , you look ravishing .
if i were your man , i wouldn &apos;t need clues to find you .
or to ravish me , i &apos;m sure. who is that ?
probably some bitch from chapin .
hot bitch from chapin .
forget her. go get nate .
point him in the right direction .
first things first .
well , hello , angel .
you must be my lucky night .
and with taste to boot .
apparently not .
i &apos;m talking to you .
beautiful and mean ? i &apos;ve got chills .
care to dance with a poor devil ?
why don &apos;t we just skip all that and , uh ,
go somewhere quiet to talk ?
i &apos;ll get the champagne .
find me in five .
taking a company public is an enormous responsibility .
there &apos;s nothing more valuable than making a good first impression .
and you taught me that , eleanor .
captain , you know that i adore you ,
but you &apos;ve never done fashion before .
i have been talking to calvin &apos;s people , and i have to say ,
the presentation is very impressive .
enough business talk , howard.you &apos;re boring her .
mm. eleanor , i &apos;ve been thinking .
when nate and blair get engaged ,
she should have my great @-@ grandmother &apos;s ring ,
the one that cornelius vanderbilt gave her ?
you still spying on him ?
i &apos;m not spying . i &apos;m just ...
keeping track of his whereabouts .
well , so long as you &apos;re watching , he &apos;s winning .
if you really want to make a man jealous ,
there &apos;s only one thing to do .
rufus , i invited you here for many reasons ,
but knowledge of romance is not ...
that was , um ...
unexpected
give him 20 minutes .
i need a drink . i need a drink .
so every time we see their yacht now ,
we just pull out our air horns and let &apos; em rip .
wow . i tell you ,
it is almost enough to make you never want to summer in newport again .
wow , that sounds , uh , awful .
it is. it &apos;s pretty bad .
yeah , yeah , um , you know what ? if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i , uh , i think i &apos;m gonna go and ... change partners ?
hey.dan , what are you doing here ? i &apos;m saving you .
i don &apos;t need to be saved. really ? &apos; cause , uh ,
i could see your eyes rollingto the back of your head from across the room. dan .
hey. blair sent us over .
she said it &apos;s getting late , and you &apos;re taking too long .
&quot; your lady @-@ in @-@ waiting is closer than you think ,
her headdress is feathers of black and pink . &quot;
it &apos;s her. it &apos;s me .
what ? i &apos;m sorry .
just find serena .
she &apos;ll lead you to blair .
serena. right .
let &apos;s play a game .
i &apos;d say strip poker , but i don &apos;t have my cards .
how about , uh , hide @-@ and @-@ seek ?
you hide . i &apos;ll seek .
and how will you find me ? i don &apos;t have any bread crumbs .
well , you can leave me a trail ...
with your clothes .
i have truly died and gone to heaven .
serena , wait .
what are you really doing here , dan ?
what am i doing here
what am i doing here ? i ran across the city.i rented a tuxedo .
i stole this mask from some drunken kid ,
only to look like robin .
i conned my way in here , all to see you . i care .
well , you didn &apos;t seem to care this morning ,
when you were with another girl and lied about it
what ? whoa , whoa , whoa ,
i @-@ i didn &apos;t ... well ... i did .
yeah . i did , but i can explain .
go ahead. give it your best shot .
i was with my friend vanessa .
we &apos;re very close , and she moved away to vermont last year ,
and now she &apos;s back .
okay , so why &apos;d you lie and say it was jenny ?
because i &apos;m an idiot .
i d ... i don &apos;t know why. i ...
look , vanessa and i ...
our relationship is a little complicated ,
or it was , before i met you .
and honestly , i didn &apos;t want anything to get in the way
of you inviting me to this ...
stupid party .
well , i was gonna invite you .
really ?
so not into , uh , pompous ass the fourth ?
you &apos;re saying you &apos;re not into old friend vanessa ?
that is exactly what i &apos;m saying .
oh , yes , the other part we love about a masquerade ?
when the mask finally comes off
and the truth is revealed to all .
will you excuse me ?
i just saw the last person i ever expected to see .
yeah. how can i say no to that ?
i &apos;m sorry .
vanessa. vanessa. hey .
this is a surprise .
funny . i could say the same thing .
what ... what are you doing here ? i &apos;m writing an american history paper .
wait. that was supposed to be you .
when did we start lying to each other ?
i @-@ i merely refrained from sharing the truth ,
which would have sounded a lot more like a lie than what i told you .
humphrey .
i &apos;m ... i didn &apos;t understand that either , i admit ,
but what was i going to say ? that i was renting a tuxedo
to attend a masked ball without a mask or an invitation
to go get a girl who not only has a mask and an invitation ,
but another date ? at least it &apos;s honest .
you ... you hate this world. so do you , or so i thought .
all right , what &apos;s going on exactly ?
did you follow me here to prove that i was lying ?
yes , dan , that &apos;s why i &apos;m here .
i stalked you because i am just so obsessed with you .
wait. don &apos;t stop there .
you &apos;re the whole reason i came back to new york ,
cause i just couldn &apos;t stop thinking about you .
all right , i get the point. you can lay off the sarcasm ...
how about i lay off the whole evening ? bye. wait , wait , wait , stop .
hold on. listen . i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m sorry that i lied about writing a term paper .
you said you love me .
loved you ...
in the past and in a preshaving , 16 @-@ year @-@ old kind of way .
you know , i mean , things have changed .
clearly .
looks like someone &apos;s traded up .
so that &apos;s , um ...
vanessa , yeah. she &apos;s ...
beautiful .
i @-@ i @-@ i have to go after her . i &apos;m sorry .
feel free to find me .
i found your pants .
well , you &apos;re getting warmer ,
which is an achievement considering you &apos;re already hot .
well , you better hope it doesn &apos;t get cold .
what is that supposed to mean ?
what the hell ? !
hey , my phone is in my pants ,
and i &apos;m stuck up here , bitch !
vanessa !
vanessa , wait , please .
why won &apos;t you wait ? come here ... oh .
because you &apos;re not vanessa . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;m sorry .
case of mistaken identity .
ironically , not involving masks .
lily .
there you are .
oh , i just needed a moment .
that ... what just happened ... the kiss ?
yeah , it made me feel a little ... nostalgic ?
nauseous. right , um , ouch .
no , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m kidding , kind of .
i &apos;m sorry , rufus .
i @-@ i ... maybe i shouldn &apos;t have asked you here .
right , um , and , um ,
i &apos;m sorry i kissed you , but i did it because
that mercenary in the starched white shirt ...
he doesn &apos;t appreciate everything you have
over an attractive 25 @-@ year @-@ old mannequin .
cause beauty fades ,
though yours has done a remarkable job of holding on ,
and in the long run , it &apos;s gonna be his loss .
and i thought he should know how it feels to lose you .
cause trust me , it &apos;s not fun .
i think it worked .
lily , may i speak with you for a moment ?
if you &apos;ll excuse us .
happy to help .
she means nothing .
jenny ? hey .
serena .
um , look , you didn &apos;t see me here , okay ?
yeah , don &apos;t worry about it. just one in a series of things
i &apos;ll pretend didn &apos;t happen tonight .
is everything okay ?
i &apos;m not sure. dan surprised me by showing up here .
well , go , dan ! yeah , except then he threw me for a loop
by chasing after some girl named vanessa .
no , v. &apos; s dan &apos;s best friend .
yeah , well , they seemed like a little more than that .
they &apos;ve kind of got a history , don &apos;t they ?
sure .
but , i mean , dan &apos;s never liked a girl like he likes you .
really . i mean , come on. he &apos;s at a masked ball ,
and i think he &apos;d go basically anywhere with you ...
except for maybe the ice capades
cause that really freaked him out when he was 5 .
you know what ? i ... i think i &apos;ll go and try to find him .
i don &apos;t know how i &apos;m gonna find anyone .
this stupid mask keeps falling over my eyes .
well , i &apos;d give you mine , but masks come off at midnight ,
and i kind of need my disguise to get out of here .
you know what ? you wanna trade ?
sure .
thanks .
and here , take this. it &apos;s so hot in here ,
and you &apos;ll probably be cold outside .
here you go .
did you have fun tonight ?
it was everything i hoped .
good .
okay , let &apos;s see. here .
oh , thanks. pretty .
serena , just don &apos;t say anything and let me explain .
i &apos;ve been trying to do the right thing , but it &apos;s killing me .
look , i know we both care about blair ,
but maybe the best thing is for me to just tell her the truth .
i &apos;m not over you , and i thought i could fight it , but i can &apos;t .
and if you don &apos;t stop me , i &apos;m gonna kiss you .
nate ?
nate , what are you doing ?
it &apos;s almost midnight . you have to find blair. look , okay , whatever .
just forget the clue .
she &apos;s wearing big , tall boots and a big old crown .
just go , okay ? hurry .
serena , have you seen nate ? hey !
five , four , three , two , one !
jenny .
it &apos;s midnight ! masks off !
serena .
serena ! sere ... serena , wait .
i &apos;m so sorry. serena !
little jenny humphrey manages to get my pants off
and have me not enjoy it .
quite the accomplishment .
good thing someone else at the party was as lecherous as you ,
or you &apos;d still be up on that roof ,
and , no , i don &apos;t want to know what you had to do to get that tux .
this is me .
all right , chuck , i &apos;ll see you in the a.m.
unh @-@ unh. no , you didn &apos;t find me by midnight .
no happily ever after for you .
blair , i &apos;m ... i &apos;m sorry .
all i wanted was for us to start over ,
and you didn &apos;t even try .
well , at least somebody &apos;s having a good night .
serena , hey. what ... will you please just talk to me ?
please. why did you run away from me ?
wait. what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re the one that ran away .
i don &apos;t think so.blonde hair , yellow dress , black furry thing ?
there is only one serena van der woodsen .
yeah , no , not tonight .
let me say ...
for the record ...
i like you .
only you .
well , that &apos;s good , because i feel the same about you .
i &apos;m glad that &apos;s cleared up .
hey , um , you know , i hear the ice capades are coming to town .
mm. if you &apos;re there , so am i .
you guys are up late .
we were celebrating .
eleanor waldorf has agreed to let your father &apos;s firm take her company public .
congrats. that &apos;s great news .
it is , which is why i was looking for a wine opener
so i could surprise your father with a bottle of margaux ,
which is how i found this .
well , what do you have to say for yourself , nate ?
what ?
well , it isn &apos;t mine , and it isn &apos;t your father &apos;s ,
so that only leaves one other person in this house .
hey , you &apos;re still up .
yeah , not that tired. well , i am . i &apos;m exhausted .
i ended up going to that ball , actually .
oh , really ?
yeah .
well , your night &apos;s not over .
there &apos;s someone here to see you .
pierogis ? i come in peace .
great . &apos; cause i &apos;m starving .
save it , humphrey. you &apos;ve never done contrite well .
besides , i &apos;m the one who should apologize .
no , really , i am . i should have told you about serena .
and i should have asked you. well , i shouldn &apos;t have lied about tonight
and i shouldn &apos;t have run out on you .
look , if we &apos;re gonna be friends again ,
we &apos;re gonna have to figure this stuff out .
you &apos;re right ,
and i &apos;ve missed having a friend .
i &apos;ve missed being one .
we can start slow , with the basics .
like , uh , fewer lies , more ukrainian food .
and you telling me about everything i missed while i was gone ,
such as serena .
well , she &apos;s pretty fantastic , almost as good as this pierogi .
yeah , she &apos;s got this crazy mother who &apos;s always , like , sparring with me
and this ... and this best friend
who &apos;s very hard for me to deal with .
the best friend has a boyfriend who &apos;s hard for me to deal with .
it &apos;s ... it &apos;s all very hard for me. it &apos;s very hard for me .
