guys , we &apos;re going on a cruise
and you guys are coming with us .
none of you have a choice .
a cruise ? if i wanted to watch
a heavy @-@ set guy in sandals eating with his hands ,
i would &apos;ve just posted up
and watched nick in the kitchen .
when we were together ,
we booked a cruise .
we tried to get our money back ,
but it &apos;s ...
nonrefundable .
yeah .
they made that very clear .
seemed like a safe bet at the time .
i don &apos;t want a refund on my cruises
and i don &apos;t want a refund on you .
we &apos;re never gonna die !
yeah !
y &apos;all nasty .
ah @-@ ha @-@ ha , yeah !
where you going ?
yes !
what are you doing now ?
oh , there she goes ...
turns out , i do want a refund ...
on you .
give me my money back !
anyway , they let us downgrade our &quot; lovers &apos; suite &quot;
to include four more people .
and that &apos;s you guys .
i have some concerns about going on a cruise
with two people that just broke up .
absolutely .
me , too .
yeah ,
i have the exact same concern as winnie .
like , i don &apos;t want to go .
i have strong qualms as well .
he got qualms .
put those qualms away .
yeah . it &apos;s gonna be fine , okay ?
totally . we are killing this breakup , honestly .
but we &apos;re gonna be on a ship
in the middle of the ocean with no escape .
what if you guys get in a big fight
and we &apos;re stuck out there with you ?
it &apos;ll be like a floating , all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat prison .
i promise you
no weirdness
guess that &apos;s an excuse
to go out and buy a new bikini .
which could be good .
i &apos;m in .
full steam ahead ! we have two on board !
nope !
let &apos;s not do , uh , nautical puns , please .
if we &apos;re gonna do nautical puns , we shouldn &apos;t ...
we shouldn &apos;t go .
that &apos;s fair , and i won &apos;t .
i &apos;m in , too .
uh , i have an idea . just throwing this out there .
what if
we do the cruise
on the ground ?
like , on land .
that &apos;s silly .
what , are you scared of boats or something ?
afraid ... me , afraid of boats ?
you &apos;re afraid of boats , dude .
ha ! he &apos;s scared of boats ?
hold on , hold on .

it looks like we &apos;re all in the same boat .
excuse me . if we could just continue on
without any more nautical puns , that &apos;d be great .
feels like that &apos;s just the lowest form of humor .

what &apos;s up , captain ?
hello , again .
i &apos;m captain jan nortis ,
as i previously stated .
i would just like to say that
i am a fan of your enthusiasm .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
please don &apos;t do that .
sorry .
i may be a captain ,
but first and foremost ,
i am a woman .
absolutely .
come on !
did anyone just see
that she was flirting like crazy with nick ?
that was , like , the most shameless
flirting i &apos;ve ever seen .
&quot; keep it in your pants &quot;
is all i have to say to captain jan nortis .
you &apos;re being really weird .
you &apos;re being weird .
super weird right now .
here we go .
this is starting now already .
i am not being weird .
you &apos;re creating an awkward
situation for no reason .
don &apos;t do this , jess .
if this ship moves as fast as that captain ,
we &apos;ll be in ensenada by 6 : 00 .
well , she was flirting with you .
which i &apos;m okay with ,
because she is a handsome woman .
jess , stop . you &apos;re being weird .
no , i &apos;m not being weird .
i &apos;m not being weird !
i am , i am being weird .
okay , focus up for a second .
okay , they say this is an all @-@ inclusive trip ,
but you know what that means .
but from their eyes , you have a couple of drinks ,
and then you &apos;re done . and then what have you paid for ?
we &apos;re smarter than that , okay ?
we are .
we &apos;re gonna take every class ,
we &apos;re gonna do every activity .
we &apos;re gonna get our money &apos;s worth .
okay .
got it ?
uh , jessica day and nick miller .
all right , day @-@ miller party .
here is your itinerary for the grand romance package .
no ! no !
yeah , we &apos;re looking for something more like pg @-@ 13 .
what do you have ?
do you have , like , a friendship package or ... ?
what package would you recommend
for two brothers looking for trouble ?
the grand romance package is nonrefundable .
well , we &apos;re not doing that , so we &apos;re good .
are you sure ? this includes over $ 600 of activities and ...
we &apos;re gonna do it .
we &apos;re not doing it .
$ 600 ?
that is 600 one @-@ dollar bills .
that &apos;s the only way i can imagine it .
we can do this .
okay . yeah .
we &apos;re gonna get our money &apos;s worth .
we are the best ex @-@ couple in the whole world .
yeah , we are .
yes .
yes . okay ?
you guys are exes ?
yeah , you &apos;re not gonna want to do this .
we &apos;re doing it .
give us the folder .
i just wanted to say ...
grumpy gus !
no ! no ! no !
grumpy gus .
sweet mother of sea dragon !
what ? what happened ?
i just witnessed a dolphin
being cut straight in half by our keel .
it &apos;s a ghastly sight .
what ?
that &apos;s horrible !
terrible .
it &apos;s a shame about the dolphin , man .
really is .
what ? !
as your bodies become one ,
follow your breath
through your spine to the soles of your feet
and into your genitals .
what ?
into my genitals ?
yeah .
into your genitals ...
i &apos;m not breathing into my genitals , lady .
all right , lovers , let &apos;s get sexy .
give me your sexiest pose right here .
this is it . this is it .
sexiest pose .
that &apos;s not ... it &apos;s not romantic in any way .
think about the first time you kissed . how was it ?
if you can move in .
come back in .
come back in .
wow , i &apos;ve never done a couples massage on exes before .
in case you &apos;re wondering what that scar on his back is ,
it &apos;s from falling on a fence when he was six .
i was legally dead for ten minutes .
we &apos;re going to make all the towel animals
you guys find in your rooms every single night !
we made laundry .
nice .
we &apos;re just totally different people .
yeah , we just don &apos;t belong together .
you &apos;re really bumming me out .
hey , jess , is this doing weird stuff to your eyes ?
definitely .
give me five , man ! leaving me hanging !
you know what ? you were right .
this isn &apos;t weird at all .
no , it isn &apos;t .
are they out of rosé ?
you know what ?
this is an old bartending trick , jess .
put your glass out . you go like this ...
no way .
look at that . you got some rosé .
you &apos;re a genius .
i think i &apos;m smarter at sea .
you look ,
you look like you belong here .
what &apos;s that , on a ship ?
yeah , you , too .
well , that was a mistake .
yes , it was !
that was not on purpose .
my fault , too .
yep . yeah , it was ...
we can &apos;t do the grand romance package anymore .
i agree . we should ...
no . it &apos;s too much . it &apos;s too intense .
they whip you into this sexual frenzy . i know .
it &apos;s weird . i just feel like ...
yeah , &apos; cause everything &apos;s fine .
you know , i feel like a cruise tonight .
it &apos;s not , like , a really big deal . i feel like ...
we &apos;re good . everything &apos;s good .
yeah , no problem , no problem .
all right , bye , dude .
bye .
jess , i &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
i was hoping that as a group , we could do a little night fishing ...
that i already put a deposit down on ,
so we &apos;re going .
and if we don &apos;t catch anything ,
they &apos;ll let us shoot a machine gun directly into the water .
that is international waters for you , baby .
i would really love nothing more than to go out there
and shoot a bunch of fish in the face with you ,
but i think that &apos;s more of a nick thing .
and yesterday , we decided it would be better for everyone
if we just spent the rest of the time apart .
what ?
i &apos;m really sorry . i wanted this
to be a great vacation for you guys .
but look , we split up the ship :
i took starboard , he took the other one .
i got the starboard and she got the other side .
what are you doing , man ?
you &apos;re hanging out by an exhaust vent .
it keeps the left side of my face warm
and it sounds like the ocean .
more than the ocean sounds like the ocean ?
come on , nick . you guys can &apos;t be separate the whole trip .
the trip just made it clear . the breakup &apos;s too hard .
i don &apos;t think we can be friends for a while .
what ? you &apos;re not gonna be friends with jess ?
and even you guys said it . it &apos;s just too weird .
nick , man , that &apos;s like the president and the vice president
not being best friends .
they &apos;re not best friends .
come on . everybody knows they &apos;re best friends .
they work together , but they &apos;re not best friends .
dude , they &apos;re the president
and the vice president .
okay .
i mean , is this something you &apos;re okay with ?
no , i &apos;m not okay , but what am i gonna do ?
well ... i mean , look , man ,
we all have to be together on this trip .
that &apos;s why we came here .
nick ,
there &apos;s gotta be something i can do .
yeah , you know what you can do ?
yeah , anything , come on .
you can cash in my skee ball tickets
on the other side of the boat .
get me one of those toy spiders
that i was talking to you about before .
and if they &apos;re out ...
all right , man , all right .
... can you grab me a bunch of erasers ?
the opportunity has not presented itself
as i &apos;d hoped it would , so i &apos;m creating it now .
when i say , &quot; may our progeny bathe
in the infinite glow , &quot; that &apos;s your cue .
now , what ... what did i just say ?
you repeat it so i know that you know the cue .
may our pro ... what ?
what &apos;s wrong with you ? unbelievable .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying .
i &apos;ll just say , &quot; go , &quot; okay ?
when i say , &quot; go , &quot; you start to play .
and before she sees , just get behind ... get behind the vent .
get behind the vent .
cece ...
um , your hair in the moonlight ...
it looks so shiny .
you know , i &apos;m trying to get a signal so i can talk to buster ,
but it &apos;s just impossible out here .
in the moonlight , your eyes ,
they sparkle like , like fish eyes .
i got one . now , like , what , do i have to hold it
at this angle the whole time ?
why is it so important for you to get in touch with buster ?
look , you know better than anyone
that i don &apos;t have the best of luck with relationships .
and i know you think he &apos;s young for me .
i don &apos;t .
i just want you to be happy .
thank you .
guys , guys !
you got to come with me right now .
be warned , though ,
there is a weird guy with a violin
hiding behind this vent .
a what ?
dude !
what &apos;s going on ?
come on ... right .
i will ... i will knock you out where you stand , sir .
get back there .
they &apos;re gonna take a break from being friends for a while ?
what does that even mean ?
guys , this is on us .
we &apos;re the ones who put the pressure
on them to not be weird .
i know . what were we thinking ?
of course they &apos;re gonna be weird . they just broke up .
hey , that &apos;s on y &apos;all . i @-@ i have nothing to do with that .
i &apos;ve just been chilling in the room .
hanging out , singing songs .
* you are safe in the room *
* you are safe , you will live ... *
i &apos;ve been trying to get them to talk
to each other all morning , okay ?
i passed up on breakfast pizza
and singles bingo .
and those bingo chicks ?
oh , they put out . bingo !
they &apos;re not gonna listen to us .
don &apos;t @-@ don &apos;t ever do that again .
the bingo thing ? that &apos;s what they ...
it &apos;s funny , that &apos;s what they say .
you know who they will listen to , though ?
a doctor . the president !
the ca ...
what were you ...
what were you gonna say ?
the captain .
the captain .
attention , this is your captain .
would nick miller and jessica day
please return to their stateroom
for a non @-@ life @-@ threatening but necessary
official maritime reason .
this is not an emergency .
it is definitely not .
did you hear the captain ?
yes !
go , go , go !
everybody inside ! this is not a drill !
okay !
okay , the door is locked .
the &quot; do not disturb &quot; sign has been employed .
we are not leaving here
until you guys are friends again .
we just wanted to spend our vacation alone .
yes .
on separate strange parts of this ship .
yeah , it &apos;s ...
i really wanted to see how the ship worked .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
and i really wanted to see
how the other side of the ship worked .
yeah .
it &apos;s interesting .
we should &apos;ve never asked you guys
not to be weird around us .
we @-@ we want you to be weird around us .
yeah .
just let us in .
open your cellar doors ,
and let us taste your jams .
you want to &quot; taste our jams &quot; ?
again , you have lost me .
listen to yourself for once in your life .
it &apos;s my jam and you can &apos;t have it .
first of all , that &apos;s my
ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s jam , dude .
i put a ban on jam .
okay , you know what ? all of us are weird .
but we &apos;re all still friends .
so , let &apos;s talk about it .
i &apos;ll go first .
i &apos;ve made out
with half of the guys in this room .
okay .
that &apos;s a start .
all right .
that &apos;s a start .
and i have had nightmares
about making out with the other two guys in this room .
so , yourself ?
and me .
nick and winston .
okay . okay .
it &apos;s good for you to finally admit that .
i respect that .
yeah , thanks for sharing .
um , it really bums me out
that i &apos;ll never know the infinite joy
of what it feels like to carry a child inside of me .
okay , coach !
that &apos;s honest .
that &apos;s real honest . that &apos;s how it &apos;s done .
okay , um ...

just turn on the tap . you know , let it out .
really nice .
that was cool that you admitted that .
i feel weird about living with my ex @-@ girlfriend .
yeah . you know , i think it &apos;s a landmine for trouble .
what &apos;s gonna happen when other hunks come around ?
what &apos;s gonna happen when you bring some ho @-@ bag in the house ?
exactly ! like , that ... it &apos;s scary stuff , and i feel like
when a breakup happens , you mostly get away .
&apos;cause i &apos;m gonna beat her ass .
what if she &apos;s bigger than you ?
she probably will be .
oh , snap ! that was good .
good for you !
yeah ! i saw that , man .
that &apos;s how it all starts . this is how it starts .
good .
that &apos;s good , man , that &apos;s really good .

like that and see if you don &apos;t get turned on .
yeah , because they fold the towels like vaginas .
they &apos;re swans , dude .
and the yoga instructor was , like , breathing
into our genitals , and , like ...
