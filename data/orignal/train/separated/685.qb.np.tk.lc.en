revenge s02e13
if you attempt to alert daniel to
our resurgent relationship ,
your son will be removed permanently .
there is $ 50,000
for your signature and a swift departure .
my father-- he almost had
the waterfront in the palm of his hand .
all we need is the stowaway ,
and we can regain that foothold that he once had .
ashley , could you please close the door ?
you can &apos;t do anything against the ryans .
they will hurt you .
padma referred to carrion as a program .
i never told her that .
remember what &apos;s at stake for you
if you don &apos;t find the carrion program .
aiden , what happened ?
it &apos;s done .
they made it look like an overdose .
if there &apos;s a chance that my sister &apos;s alive ,
then i &apos;m gonna find her .
and if she is dead , then this is on you .
aiden . aiden !
i , amanda clarke ,
take you , jack porter , to be my husband ...
in the presence of our best man sammy .
amanda ?
wow . what is going on here ?
it &apos;s my wedding , daddy .
it looks like you &apos;re preparing one fancy event .
what are these pipe cleaners ?
they &apos;re wedding rings , silly .
these are very nice rings .
so who is the lucky guy ?
ah , jack .
hey , mr. clarke .
well , uh , i think you &apos;re just in time .
for what ?
in it &apos;s purest form ,
a union becomes part of our very essence .
but when that bond is broken ...
our essence is forever changed .
officiant certificate-- check .
bridal bouquet--ordered .
wedding cake--on hold .
who knew &quot; officiant &quot; was french
for &quot; wedding bitch &quot; ?
you okay ?
any news on aiden &apos;s whereabouts ?
well , not since la la land .
seems he &apos;s taken a page from your manual
on how to disappear without a trace .
you don &apos;t think he &apos;d go after the initiative on his own ?
they just murdered his sister .
at this point , i don &apos;t know what he &apos;ll do .
anything on padma ?
oh , no communication there yet either ,
but believe me ,
i &apos;ve got eyes and ears all over that one .
if they make contact , i &apos;ll know .
whatever you do , you cannot let padma know
that you &apos;re on to her .
i won &apos;t .
look , i know this isn &apos;t exactly the ...
happy ending you envisioned for you and jack ...
all that matters is that he &apos;s happy .
ems ...
there &apos;s no shame in admitting that
your feelings about this marriage are ...
complicated at the least .
i meant what i said .
i &apos;m happy that things are going jack &apos;s way .
he deserves it .
and ...
amanda does , too .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;d call conrad grayson
commandeering half of the stowaway
&quot; things going great for jack . &quot;
what are you talking about ?
amanda didn &apos;t tell you ?
tell her what ?
me thinks i &apos;ll let you two work this out .
sans moi .
see you at the altar , mandy .
what ?
a casino right here .
condos with a bay view right over there .
it &apos;s atlantic city but in half the time .
yeah , and what about the marshland to the east ?
i &apos;m hearing we may have a fight on our hands with rezoning .
not to worry .
once you announce your gubernatorial plans ,
those on the city council will be eager
to earn favor with new york &apos;s next governor .
and for the ones who do cause problems ,
there are ways to handle them , too .
it might be best if you left the negotiations to us .
hey , don &apos;t talk to me
like i &apos;m some kind of schoolkid , sweetheart .
i brought you this opportunity . i am not getting pushed out .
we &apos;re fully aware of your contribution thus far
and in no way seek to minimize your role in the project .
a rising tide lifts all boats .
why wouldn &apos;t you ask me for help ?
jack insisted we keep it inside the family .
i had to honor that .
and so you went to conrad ?
amanda , whatever you need jack to believe about you ,
charlotte is not your sister
any more than conrad is her father .
the graysons were and always will be the enemy .
take this to the bank and
get a cashier &apos;s check for whatever amount you owe him ,
plus interest , for his trouble .
jack won &apos;t take your money .
make him .
amanda , trust me . the graysons always have a hidden agenda .
thank you .
oh , my god . you actually shaved .
i figured , if i was ever gonna ...
uh @-@ oh . feeding time .
i &apos;ll do it . you got the diaper .
okay . his , uh , his bottles are in the fridge .
i &apos;ll warm it up .
you guys really got this whole parenting thing down .
oh , that compliment sounds like
it &apos;s got a favor attached to it .
guilty as charged .
i , um ...
i was hoping you and charlotte
could look after carl for a few days .
yeah , man . we got you covered .
does this mean you &apos;re actually gonna do something fun ?
i know .
it &apos;s been ... pretty heavy around here lately .
but ... i feel like ever since we got out from under the ryans ,
i &apos;m just-- i @-@ i can breathe again .
and i want to do something nice for her .
you &apos;re up later than usual .
daniel , must we continue
with this endless display of animosity ?
i don &apos;t know how much longer i can weather this .
emily came clean about
how you manipulated her into spying on me . it &apos;s pathetic .
the fact that she agreed to my proposition
should call her own motives into question .
oh , say what you want about emily ,
but at least she had the courage
to tell me the truth ,
which is more than i can say about you .
lock the door behind you .
aiden .
where the hell have you been ?
emily &apos;s been worried sick .
i know you helped intercept
the video of my sister &apos;s death .
yes .
and i couldn &apos;t be more sorry .
call it up .
run the video .
what can you tell me about this file
i &apos;m not seeing ?
well , what are we looking for ?
anything .
all right .
anything . anything that leads me to who filmed it .
well , this is the file &apos;s structural metadata .
embedded in its intel , bit rate , format ...
date of creation .
six years ago .
six years ago ?
crowley led me to believe this was--
this was filmed three days ago .
she lied . that &apos;s what they do .
see , there was nothing you or emily could &apos;ve done
to prevent this .
it had already happened .
and emily is no more to blame in this than you are .
is there any way to determine where it was filmed ?
all right . uh ...
yeah , there . see that ?
an electric meter . so what ?
each one is embedded with a serial number
unique to its location .
if i can just enhance the image enough
to read its sequence--
we can hack the power company &apos;s records , find--
and you have--you have the enhancement program ?
yes . yes , yes , yes .
then run the enhancement program .
but it &apos;s going to take time .
look , why don &apos;t we call emily ...
no .
tell her you have a lead--
no .
no , i don &apos;t-- i don &apos;t want emily involved .
aiden--
just run the program !
i tracked the electrical meter from the video
to a condemned apartment building in jersey city .
did he say what he was expecting to find ?
i don &apos;t even think he knows .
to get clues as to who killed her , i guess .
or irrefutable proof that she &apos;s actually dead .
the initiative has him second @-@ guessing everything .
aiden &apos;s not the only one .
what did the initiative want with a teenage girl ?
their father was the real target .
aiden &apos;s dad was a baggage handler at heathrow .
he loaded the bomb on to flight 197 .
colleen was never heard from again .
do you think there &apos;s a possibility
that the initiative is doing the same thing to padma ?
maybe they got to her family , too .
i don &apos;t know , but right now
all i care about is finding aiden .
in the meantime , i need you to hack into
the jersey city police system .
cross @-@ check all jane does from six years ago
with colleen &apos;s description .
helen , i need to go on record here .
switching funds out of the european markets
is fiscal suicide .
we &apos;re comfortable with the short @-@ term losses .
daniel , our final plans are much grander in scope .
algiers , bahrain , tunisia--
these are all highly volatile regions
with unregulated banking systems .
which is precisely why
we are investing in their infrastructure .
these emerging governments
need the financial backing of western companies
to facilitate reform .
fine . i &apos;ll execute the purchase orders
once i &apos;m at the office .
they set me up , victoria .
angola , libya--
i wouldn &apos;t even know who to contact there .
someone made it look like i moved money
for the people that blew up the plane .
but i swear to you , i didn &apos;t do this .
david , the evidence tells a completely different story ,
and even if what you &apos;re saying is true ,
i wouldn &apos;t know how to begin to help you .
i know . i know .
and i shouldn &apos;t be putting you in this position .
it &apos;s just ...
i really have no one else to turn to .
the whole world is ... against me .
victoria , are you there ?
i &apos;m sorry , david .
there &apos;s nothing i can do for you .
please don &apos;t call me again .
what &apos;s this ?
it &apos;s a little spot i found in nantucket .
i was thinking we could take the boat ,
sail it out , stay a couple nights ...
alone .
still got one working credit card .
it &apos;s time we start enjoying our lives a little more .
i already got dec on board to take care of carl .
what do you say ?
how about &quot; i love you &quot; ?
and , um ...
i &apos;ve got a gift of my own .
why do you have a check from emily ?
and why are there so many zeroes ?
she wants us to convert it to a cashier &apos;s check
and buy back the bar from conrad .
i thought we agreed to keep the grayson deal between us .
i know .
but she found out . you know emily .
i don &apos;t want to be in debt to any of my friends .
you &apos;d rather be in debt to your enemies ?
i get it , jack . you &apos;re proud .
you want to solve your own problems ,
and look ...
i &apos;m partially responsible for us being here .
but we have to keep in mind what they &apos;re capable of .
do i have to remind you what happened last time ?
i almost lost you .
so why not let emily help us get rid of them ...
forever ?
conrad , a word .
victoria , do you mind ?
we &apos;re actually in the middle of things--
and fully clothed . how refreshing .
perhaps it &apos;d be best if you gave us
a moment of privacy .
i need a copy of every transaction
you ever made on behalf of the initiative in the &apos; 90s ,
the same ones that the government used
to convict david clarke .
you know , if i remember correctly ,
you long ago requested to remain ignorant
of all those tedious little details .
would you care to explain the about @-@ face ?
i overheard a phone conversation
between daniel and helen crowley .
and i think it--
you think it &apos;s begun .
yes .
and if he follows their orders ...
he &apos;ll be culpable ...
of whatever catastrophe they &apos;re about to unleash .
now unfortunately , my son no longer listens to me ,
let alone trusts a word i have to say .
but faced with hard evidence , perhaps he can be convinced .
now do you have the documents or not ?
aiden ?
if you &apos;re here to talk me out of this ,
i &apos;m not interested .
i &apos;m not .
how can i talk you out of anything
if i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking ?
if that video was made six years ago ,
and not three days like helen said ,
then maybe it was never even real at all .
maybe they staged the whole damn thing .
i want to believe it , too , aiden .
but you don &apos;t .
i didn &apos;t come here to fight .
i came here to help .
then help me .
the video was made right here .
this is the closest i &apos;ve been to her since she was taken .
i was 12 .
i never saw her again .
it &apos;s nolan .
he &apos;s been looking into coroner reports from 2007 .
ems , i &apos;ve got some bad news .
mr. grayson .
yes .
there &apos;s a jack porter here to see you .
jack , what a pleasant surprise .
there &apos;s , uh , some extra in there for you ,
for your trouble .
i &apos;m no tycoon ,
but i figure it &apos;s not bad for one week &apos;s investment .
i appreciate the offer , but , um ,
i can &apos;t accept this .
i don &apos;t understand .
we ... we agreed that once i paid off the loan ,
i &apos;d get back full ownership of the bar .
that was the deal , right ?
the deal &apos;s changed , jack .
have a look .
what the hell is all this ?
these plans represent a revitalized vision
of the waterfront property .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i think the community
has far outgrown its antiquated ,
albeit charming , blue @-@ collar mystique .
i think you &apos;re forgetting that i still own half my bar ,
and i &apos;m not selling if that &apos;s what you expect me to do .
jack , i &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t fully grasp
your current inexorable station ,
so allow me to educate you .
as we speak , the bank is reassessing
your financial viability as a mortgage holder ,
and i think we both know that you fail to meet
even the most lenient threshold for continued approval .
now this assessment is going to trigger an assumption clause ,
allowing me to absorb your debt and own the bar outright .
let me educate you about a few things .
you either accept my very generous offer ...
or i will fight you every step of the way .
i will drag you through court .
i will get every quaint blue @-@ collar buddy of mine
to block every bulldozer you throw at that waterfront .
and i swear to god ...
i will make you wish you never heard the word &quot; montauk . &quot;
as i suspected , you are a man of principle .
and i look forward to demonstrating
what a man of means is truly capable of .
good @-@ bye , jack .
they &apos;re pulling the coroner &apos;s files from archives .
it &apos;ll take a few minutes .
is it daniel ?
aiden , he doesn &apos;t matter right now .
he matters more than ever . he &apos;s our link to the initiative .
take the call .
daniel , hi .
there you are .
i was starting to think you were avoiding my calls .
um , no , no . it &apos;s just been one of those days , you know ?
anything i can do to help ?
no . um ...
my accountant from my foundation
had me tied up all day , that &apos;s all .
got it . i won &apos;t keep you .
it &apos;s just that we haven &apos;t talked since the other night .
and i ... hope i didn &apos;t give the impression i was angry with you .
the truth is , i appreciated your honesty .
not everyone would be so understanding .
well , learning how to forgive and forget
is practically a survival technique in my family .
i &apos;ll-- i &apos;ll let you get back to your charity .
i &apos;ll see you back in the hamptons .
yeah .
bye , daniel .
grayson doesn &apos;t just want the stowaway , dec.
he wants the whole damn seaboard .
well , who cares what he wants ?
we still own half the bar , right ?
we &apos;re gonna fight him .
we &apos;ll lose .
he &apos;s got more money than god .
he &apos;s got an army of lawyers and-- and political friends .
i &apos;m telling you , i don &apos;t even think it &apos;s worth the fight .
did you tell amanda about this yet ?
no . and neither will you .
the one thing i can stop the graysons from doing
is ruining our wedding .
after everything amanda &apos;s been through in her life ,
she deserves to be happy ,
even if it &apos;s just for this one day .
here you go , ms. thorne .
that &apos;s her .
that &apos;s my sister .
you were right .
you wanted to see me ?
you mind closing the doors ?
padma , i know you must think that i &apos;ve been avoiding you .
you &apos;re not wrong .
i &apos;m not an idiot .
i don &apos;t think you &apos;re an idiot at all .
i think you are ... something else entirely .
people have been lining up to use me
since i made the cover of &quot; wired &quot; at 22 , so--
i &apos;m not interested in your money , nolan .
no , no , no .
i think you are after something else far more valuable
and dangerous .
now ... i know the what .
i just can &apos;t figure out the why .
so ...
how &apos;s your father doing these days ?
what ?
well , i ran a diagnostic of all your nolcorp communications ,
and up until a month ago , you two were talking every day .
then suddenly nothing . what happened ?
you &apos;ve been spying on me ?
hey , careful who you &apos;re calling black , little kettle .
i am taking a huge risk right now ,
going against the better judgment
of someone i trust a lot more than you ,
because my feelings for you ...
defy logic .
and i &apos;m gonna ask you one last time ...
what happened to your father ?
i &apos;m telling you ...
everything &apos;s fine .
emily ?
are you here ?
you &apos;re selling your share of the stowaway back to jack ,
now .
well , as i explained to your fiance , my share &apos;s not for sale .
you couldn &apos;t be more wrong about that .
it &apos;ll work because he trusts me .
how can you be so sure ?
that &apos;s impossible .
because i know david &apos;s deepest secret .
where did you get this ?
that &apos;s not important . the fact that i have it is .
so it has been you all this time .
i haven &apos;t even begun to make
you and your family suffer for what they &apos;ve done .
so ... this is how it &apos;s gonna go .
you get your sorry ass back to the stowaway
and tell jack that at the second look ,
the numbers no longer make sense to you
or that you &apos;ve had a change of heart
or whatever lie it is you need to tell him .
as long as when you walk out of that bar ,
jack is once again the sole owner
of the one thing his father was able to leave his sons .
and after you &apos;ve apologized and wished him well ...
you never , ever utter the name porter again ,
or i promise , i will take a wrecking ball
to every bit of this pathetic excuse for a life you &apos;ve chosen .
you &apos;ve reached nate . you know what to do .
mr. ryan , uh , yes , it &apos;s , uh , conrad grayson .
i &apos;m afraid our plan to revitalize montauk
has , uh , run into a bit of a snag .
c @-@ can you meet me at the harbor ?
thank you .
colleen deserved better than this .
aiden , i &apos;m so sorry .
i am gonna track them down
and put a bullet in each one of their heads .
that &apos;s not the way . you know that .
they &apos;ll just kill you , too .
you don &apos;t understand , do you ?
everything i &apos;ve done , all my training ,
was to save my sister . i &apos;ve failed her .
just because you couldn &apos;t save colleen , it doesn &apos;t mean ...
that you can &apos;t honor her .
you know , we just have to approach this with a clear head .
well , i &apos;m sorry if i &apos;m not
as cold and calculated as you .
i can &apos;t just turn my feelings on and off
at the flick of a switch .
is that what you think ?
that i don &apos;t feel ?
that i don &apos;t miss my father every single day ?
that i don &apos;t mourn the life that i could have had ?
but that &apos;s why people like you and me fight .
because it gives us something to live for
when everything else has been taken away .
i thought you understood that .
i thought we shared that .
we can do this together , aiden .
don &apos;t go .
aiden , don &apos;t leave me alone in this .
aiden .
with my signature here ,
the bar is yours , mr. porter .
i don &apos;t get it . what changed ?
well , it turns out the coastal commission
caught a whiff of our intentions
and threatened to keep us in the courts for years .
so how about you simply thank me
and i leave this establishment forever ?
how about you just leave ?
with pleasure .
a month ago , my mother called to tell me
my father had left for a business trip
and that she hadn &apos;t heard from him for three days .
as soon as i hung up the phone with her ,
i was contacted at the office by a woman
who told me they were holding him
and that he &apos;d be safe as long as i did what they told me to .
not that i &apos;d expect you to believe any of this .
well , let &apos;s just say for now i do .
so ... what was next ?
at first , just to get close to you .
which you did . and then ?
they wanted me to locate a code
for a program you &apos;d written called carrion .
how did they know it even existed ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t even know what it does .
well , let &apos;s just say , in the wrong hands ,
carrion would have millions of innocent people
wishing i &apos;d never taken intro to computers in fourth grade .
lucky for humanity , i gave you an incomplete version of it .
so you knew all along ?
nolan , you have to know
that through this whole nightmare ...
my feelings for you ... they &apos;re all real .
and i want to believe that .
i do .
i just ... need to think .
about whether you &apos;re going to help me ...
or leave me ?
guys , crowley isn &apos;t asking for an analysis of the metrics .
she understands the volatility of these markets .
now i asked you to execute the purchase order ,
so do it already .
if you execute this deal , you &apos;re going to come to regret it
for the rest of your life , however short it will be .
what &apos;s this ?
just read it , daniel .
your client-- helen crowley--
she represents the initiative .
and they have planned for you what they did to us
all those years ago
when your father inadvertently
helped down flight 197 .
now if you go down the road with these people ,
you &apos;re not only endangering yourself ,
but everyone that you care for ,
including emily thorne .
why didn &apos;t you tell me the truth ?
because they made threats against your life , forcing my silence .
and they will make good on these threats
if they ever find out we &apos;ve spoken .
well , if i don &apos;t make that transaction she &apos;s requested ,
helen &apos;s gonna suspect something &apos;s wrong .
your father and i have a compilation of evidence
that should neutralize helen crowley and the initiative .
we just need time to
extract our complicity from the equation .
it &apos;s essential that you play along
and do exactly what she says .
yes , i &apos;m watching .
no , uh ... i &apos;ll deal with this .
we join here on this beautiful day
to celebrate the union of our dear friends
jack porter ...
and amanda clarke ,
two people who found true love , trust ,
and friendship in a world that rarely makes that easy .
amanda , honey ?
are you coming or not ?
patience , please .
oh , that &apos;s ...
may i have the rings , please ?
you guys remembered the rings , right ?
yeah .
oh , my god . you kept it ?
this just goes to show how long this was coming .
when we were kids ,
amanda and i actually acted out this day .
she made me this ring out of a pipe cleaner ,
and she insisted ... that i wear a bow tie ...
which looked a little something like this .
what i remember ...
is a feeling i didn &apos;t have a word for yet .
but when i was old enough to recognize it as love ,
you were gone .
but that feeling stayed with me .
you were always in my heart .
amanda ...
with this ring ...
you &apos;ll be in my life forever .
jack porter ...
you are the most ...
incredible person i know ...
the most ... kind
and loving ...
and generous .
i would say i don &apos;t deserve you ...
but if you &apos;ve taught me one thing , it &apos;s that ...
everyone deserves love ...
and hope ...
and security .
without you i wouldn &apos;t have any of these things .
with you , my life is complete .
with this ring ...
i promise to cherish you ...
and to honor you from this day forward
until the end of time .
ah @-@ ah @-@ ah . almost there .
and now by the power vested in me ,
i hereby pronounce you husband and wife .
you may now kiss the bride .
wait . wait . hold on a second .
24 hours ago , you were talking like this was a done deal ,
and now you &apos;re walking away
because of some regulatory hurdles ?
unfortunately , there are times
when the other side possesses leverage ,
which , shall we say , rendered the fight too costly .
&quot; other side &quot; ? who ?
we &apos;re not talking about the porters , are we ?
okay , look ,
let &apos;s say somebody was able to remove
this leverage you &apos;re talking about .
is the deal back on ?
as it stands , mr. ryan ,
that &apos;s a purely hypothetical question .
we never had this conversation .
hey , you .
hey .
sorry i didn &apos;t call you back sooner .
uh , i had jack and amanda &apos;s wedding .
oh , was that today ?
i @-@ i had no idea .
guess i &apos;m a little out of touch these days .
well , you are running a major investment firm .
it &apos;s not exactly last summer .
no , it &apos;s not , is it ?
not at all .
are you okay ?
look , i don &apos;t--i don &apos;t want to force this .
and if it &apos;s not happening for us right now ,
maybe we should take that as a sign .
daniel , where is this coming from ?
i &apos;ve just been thinking , and ...
i just don &apos;t feel like it &apos;s the right time
for us to rekindle things .
you know , it &apos;s been a hell of a summer ,
and i &apos;ve got a lot on my plate at work .
i just think it &apos;s best
that we wait for the dust to settle a bit .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what to say .
there &apos;s nothing to say .
not right now anyway .
i &apos;ll see you around , all right ?
see you soon , buddy .
you be a good little sleeper for these guys .
have a good time . go .
bye , baby .
you , uh , you ready to sail ...
mrs. porter ?
god , i like the sound of that .
smile , mr. and mrs. porter .
got it .
bon voyage .
bye !
conrad , is that you ?
no , victoria .
the house is empty .
it &apos;s just us .
i thought
you above all people
would have known better than to test our resolve .
how the hell did you get in here ?
did i not make it abundantly clear
there would be deadly repercussions
for warning daniel against us ?
if you do anything to harm him , i swear that i will--
you &apos;ll what ,
neutralize me ?
that &apos;s right .
we heard everything .
so unless you hand over
whatever evidence you claim to possess ,
daniel will soon receive a call
asking to meet me for a drink .
only when he gets downstairs ,
his regular driver will have taken the night off ,
and you will never see your boy again .
you monster .
takes one to know one , hmm ?
you know , it &apos;ll be almost a shame
when i finally have to dispense with you .
first things first , huh ?
the evidence .
or shall we make that call to daniel ?
it &apos;s in the pool house .
show me .
the safe is behind that mirror .
okay , that &apos;s enough .
i &apos;ll take it from here .
the combination , please .
1 ...
2 ...
6 @-@ 7 @-@ 3 .
it &apos;s empty .
this isn &apos;t .
well ...
clearly you are a woman of many qualities ,
some of which i have regrettably underestimated .
stop right there .
you &apos;re making a very big mistake .
the mistake was yours ,
the moment you put a target on my son &apos;s head .
it &apos;s over , helen .
why don &apos;t you just put the gun down , hmm ?
you &apos;re not gonna kill me .
victoria , you wept for 20 years
over a man you betrayed .
i hardly think you have it in you

listen to me carefully , daniel .
the next two words out of your mouth need to be ,
&quot; hello , helen . &quot;
your life depends on it .
hello , helen .
say you &apos;re sorry i couldn &apos;t make it ,
but that you &apos;ll be happy to reschedule for tomorrow .
well , i &apos;m sorry to hear about that .
yeah , yeah , breakfast works just fine for me .
now leave the office .
do not take the car service .
meet me in the pool house ,
and i &apos;ll explain everything to you when you get home .
what the hell is going on ?
what was that phone call about ?
helen crowley came to see me .
she was here ? what--what did she say ?
she said she was going to kill you .
oh , my god .
you &apos;re safe now . she &apos;s not going to harm you any longer .
you know what this reminds me of ?
we had our first kiss on this boat .
that &apos;s right .
except , um ...
you were a little bit closer .
oh , yeah ?
mm @-@ hmm .
like this ?
mm . a little bit closer .
how &apos;s this ?
perfect .
i can &apos;t find carl &apos;s pacifiers anywhere .
i think i left them on the boat
along with my laptop .
well , mine &apos;s working just fine .
we &apos;ll have these uploaded to photo @-@ share by midnight .
do you think it &apos;s okay if we call and ask &apos; em
where they keep the extra pacifiers ?

out there in the middle of the ocean ?
yeah , the ship to shore does .
i &apos;m just gonna see if he answers .
does no one answer a phone anymore ?
amanda clarke stopped by earlier today .
it seems we have a rather extraordinary problem on our hands .
i &apos;ll go first .
what on earth have you done ?
i &apos;m sorry i walked away from you .
i needed time to think .
i won &apos;t allow myself to become another casualty of these people .
my sister deserves better ,
as do you .
they will still pay , but ...
on our terms .
i lost daniel .
then we &apos;ll find another way .
you know , you were right ...
about everything you said yesterday ,
except one thing .
what &apos;s that ?
you &apos;re not alone in this ,
and you never will be .
from the moment we &apos;re born ,
we &apos;re drawn to form a union with others ...
an abiding drive to connect ,
to love ...
to belong .
in a perfect union ,
we find the strength we cannot find in ourselves .
jack ?
hey , jack . come in , it &apos;s dec.
but the strength of the union cannot be known ...
jack , look , i know you &apos;re--
until it is tested .
