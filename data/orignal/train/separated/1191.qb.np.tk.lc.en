i know i screwed up the scholarships if i can &apos;t swim .
you still haven &apos;t told us the whole truth
about how it happened .
it doesn &apos;t matter how .
it matters to us and to family services .
those people think that
what happened to you happened in this house !
i &apos;m not going to upenn .
spencer this isn &apos;t funny .
i got my rejection letter .
vienna ?
would you like to come with me ?
you have to go to vienna with zack .
mike and i , we &apos;re going to be just fine with dad .
hey what &apos;s this song ?
it &apos;s not a song , it &apos;s a phone number .
where is this area code anyways ?
york county .
did ali know anybody from there ?
i &apos;m guessing that she called her beach hotty
board shorts .
let it go , spencer .
why do you still think ali &apos;s alive ?
let it go or it will come apart
in ways that you cannot even imagine .
did you kill detective wilden ?
i &apos;ve been protecting you since it started .
the police have our names on a board
with arrows and graphs .
and not just ours , my mom &apos;s up there .
i know you were here the night that wilden was killed .
she called me , came over , said she need money .
and what happened when you told her no ?
i keep a gun locked in my desk .
it &apos;s missing .
hanna , what &apos;s wrong ?
i think my mom killed wilden
and &quot; a &quot; knows it .
mom !
mom ?
mom ?
hmm ? what &apos;s wrong ?
i had a nightmare .
mom !
hanna ?
is everything okay ?
yeah . yeah , i &apos;m fine .
you want to talk about it ?
what ?
no .
no , not yet .
okay .
good morning .
morning .
i just spoke to melissa .
she started her internship today .
yeah ?
what did she say ?
london is beautiful , but very cold .
sounds like a perfect match .
this is for you .
斯宾塞 · 海斯汀专属
what is that ?
it &apos;s what you need to read
before your meeting with brendan mcgowan .
who &apos;s that ?
he &apos;s a private admissions counselor .
he &apos;s going to help you with college .
how ?
the carlyles hired him after nora got that dui .
with brendan she was still able to go to her second choice .
but i don &apos;t have a dui .
no .
but you have radley .
brendan will know which schools to target
and how to make you most attractive to them .
oh , he &apos;s like an ivy league pimp .
sweetie , you &apos;ve worked hard
and you deserve to go to a good school .
we just need to re @-@ position you .
mom , i am not a sofa , okay ?
and nobody is more upset than i am that i didn &apos;t get into upenn ,
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i can &apos;t get into other good schools .
i agree , and so does brendan .
i was gonna make us some breakfast . you got time ?
yeah . i think so .
what about mom ?
she is at the gym .
that &apos;s the third time this week she &apos;s left before it &apos;s light out .
i know , she &apos;s ...
really working hard to--
avoid the neighbors ?
yeah .
listen , it will all blow over , emmy .
i promise .
not without humiliating you both first .
i &apos;ve been in scarier combat zones than this town .
it &apos;s gonna take more than a couple of dirty looks
at the hardware store to take me out .
it &apos;s a beautiful campus .
yeah , it &apos;s okay .
i &apos;m sorry that we can &apos;t make that work for you .
dad , it &apos;s okay .
even if we could afford it ,
i doubt i &apos;d even get in .
why would you say something like that ?
because without swimming , i &apos;m ...
average .
there is nothing average about you .
i know i can &apos;t do much ...
but i want you to know
i &apos;m gonna do everything i can to help you .
i &apos;m gonna go make that breakfast .
those eggs aren &apos;t going to burn themselves .
you &apos;re representing your family ,
your school , and your community during these college visits .
translation ?
do not use this weekend to discover beer pong .
you are to use this time
to audit classes , tour the campus ,
and decide if this is where you want to go .
hey , you guys , why would i dream that ?
i mean , &quot; a &quot; is about to drop the hammer on my mom .
the only thing your dream is telling you
is that you should be drinking warm milk before bed .
my dad &apos;s gun is missing , spencer .
yeah , and that look really bad , but we &apos;ve gone over this .
&quot; a &quot; has tried to frame us before--
no , it &apos;s not framing if you actually did it !
hanna , this is your mother .
okay , looked you in the eye and told you she didn &apos;t .
don &apos;t you guys have a class to get to ?
yeah , we &apos;re going .
you &apos;d get there faster if your feet were actually moving .
whoa , what &apos;s with your mom ?
kinda harsh .
i don &apos;t know . she &apos;s been really weird the past few days .
makes me wonder if &quot; a &apos;s &quot; moved on
from hanna &apos;s mom to mine .
well , &quot; a &quot; can multi @-@ task .
can you guys come over after school ?
i can &apos;t .
i have a strategy session at the brew .
my mom &apos;s hired a spin @-@ doctor
to make me shiny and new again .
sorry ?
it &apos;s an admissions coach .
she wants him to wave his magic loafer
and get me into college .
all right , i &apos;ll see you later , guys .
okay .
how much do you think a spin @-@ doctor like that cost ?
it &apos;s the hastings ,
so i &apos;m guessing it costs than your car .
guys , this isn &apos;t about money , okay ?
i mean , the last thing on my mind right now
is trying to sell myself .
with everything that went down with melissa ,
and tippi being birdnapped .
don &apos;t even bring up that singing canary .
parrot .
whatever .
we don &apos;t have the bird or the beast .
now that melissa &apos;s gone , we have very little to go on .
well , if melissa was telling the truth about anything ,
then we should be following the ali trail .
and that trail ends with &quot; board shorts . &quot;
and our only way of finding him
was through tippi &apos;s phone number .
i &apos;ve already spent days
researching that stupid number .
i can &apos;t find a single thread that links wilden , ian ,
or garrett to york county .
hold up .
wait , there &apos;s a college there , i just saw it .
cicero . cicero college .
is there a contact number ?
yeah .
that &apos;s interesting .
yeah .
what ?
yeah , look .
the area code and the prefix are the same .
looks like we just got a little closer .
i came to grab you for lunch ,
but hackett said you were leaving early .
should i be worried ?
no .
i &apos;m was just going to stop by the brew to see zack .
oh , okay . cool .
so , how &apos;s the trip planning going ?
you bet on how much schnitzel you can eat
before you &apos;re craving a patty melt ?
not exactly ...
i &apos;m actually gonna go to tell him that the trip is off .
what ?
why ? did you guys get in a fight ?
no , no . nothing like that .
it &apos;s just , um ...
i just changed my mind .
hold it . like two days ago
you were modeling thermals and moon boots .
what happened ?
i ...
i came to my senses .
we can we talk about it later , okay ?
i gotta go .
mom .
mom , wait .
did somebody ...
say or do something that would make you change your mind ?
actually , yes .
i had a long talk with your brother
and he &apos;s just not comfortable with me leaving .
what ?
oh , please .
mom , mike can take care of himself .
your brother &apos;s still not recovered from me moving out .
and putting an ocean in between us is not exactly ideal .
what ? what ? what are you looking at ?
is that a fly or a bee ?
it &apos;s a bee . open your window .
see ? this is why i can &apos;t move 5,000 miles away .
look , we &apos;re not losing you forever .
it &apos;s just a couple of months .
mike can deal with it .
aria , i can &apos;t discuss this right now .
but we will talk about it tomorrow at family night , okay ?
okay .
亲亲 - a
mom ! mom !
she &apos;s going to be okay , right ?
yeah , she &apos;s fine .
they put her on some anti @-@ inflammatories .
i &apos;m the one who needs a shot of something .
i &apos;m freaking out .
can you try and talk to your mom ?
can you explain--
explain what , em ?
that &quot; a &quot; gave her four @-@ wheel hive ?
i just ... i have to get her out of town before &quot; a &quot; decides to unleash
the rest of their evil ark .
hey , it &apos;s my mom &apos;s doctor on the other line .
i gotta go , okay ?
okay . give her my best , okay ?
yeah .
are you brendan ?
yeah ... spencer ?
no . i &apos;m emily .
she &apos;s running a little late .
how &apos;d you guess ?
was it the large , scary looking binder ?
yep . yeah and , uh ...
company name is on it .
can i get you anything else ?
uh , no thanks . i &apos;m good .
at the risk of sounding rude ,
what is it that you actually do ?
well , i help applicants put their best foot forward
and try to get them face @-@ time
with people who can champion them .
right .
but honestly , most of my work is emotional .
people get crazed through this process ,
they need someone to help them over the hot coals .
yeah , i get that .
i was ready to swim my way into stanford
before my shoulder got busted .
so , now i don &apos;t know what to do .
well , if i were your advisor ,
i &apos;d figure out a way to re @-@ brand you .
how did you get into all this ?
i mean , you look like you just graduated yourself .
it &apos;s a family business ,
so i trained early .
but thanks for noticing
that i &apos;m not collecting social security yet .
every time i walk through a high school door
with a blazer and tie ,
i feel like i might as well be grandpa munster .
look , if you want ...
i could go through some of these schools with you .
at least until spencer shows up .
yeah . yeah , that &apos;d be great .
thanks for agreeing to do this .
i didn &apos;t want anyone seeing me come to your office .
ashley , what did you come here to talk to me about ?
wilden . darren wilden .
i want to tell you my side of the story .
unless you think you already know .
i &apos;ve -- i &apos;ve heard some rumors , but ...
look , i have to ask this as a formality ,
are you talking to me as your friend
or as your lawyer ?
hopefully both .
i @-@ i think the police are building a case against me .
well , let me look into it .
i &apos;ve got a contact at rosewood pd .
aren &apos;t you going to ask me ?
what ?
if i &apos;m guilty ?
i &apos;ll call my contact .
you sit tight until then , okay ?
veronica , i ...
i have some skeletons in my closet .
and i just didn &apos;t want you to be surprised .
nothing surprises me anymore .
you need to cover your bases .
i would start with these three .
plus davoren has a polynesian studies major .
are you ... hawaiian ?
uh , filipino , korean , irish , scottish .
yeah , but i &apos;m not really interested
in polynesian studies ,
i want to major in biology .
well , there &apos;s no harm in faking it
for a little while though , right ?
brendan ?
yeah .
i &apos;m spencer . so sorry i &apos;m late .
no problem . your friend is great company .
no , stay .
so , i &apos;ve got this weekend &apos;s campus visit to brown set .
yeah , i was looking over that list of stuff you gave me ,
and i think i actually want to check out cicero .
i &apos;m a little confused .
cicero wasn &apos;t even on your list .
i understood from your mom that we were focusing on the ivies .
yeah , but it never hurts to have a safety school , right ?
sure .
we &apos;ll postpone brown .
why don &apos;t we meet at cicero tomorrow morning ?
i can introduce you to the head of--
actually , i was thinking that i should probably go by myself .
you know , to get a real feel for the place .
i think our time would be better
spent meeting with some department heads .
the director of admissions happens to be a family friend .
uh , do you think cicero would be a good fit for me ?
yeah . yeah .
you should totally come .
i &apos;ll drive both of us .
when did you get home ?
i don &apos;t know . like a minute ago .
where &apos;s dad ?
he &apos;s out . how &apos;s mom ?
puffy . can we talk ?
later , okay ?
i &apos;m crushing this level .
what the hell ? !
what did you say to mom
to make her change her mind about europe ?
give that back to me .
stop .
don &apos;t you even care that she &apos;s in bed right now
covered in like five layers of calamine lotion !
of course i do .
what does that have to do with europe ?
nothing , i ...
look , mike , my point is you &apos;re being selfish .
okay , you &apos;re sitting here playing video games
while she &apos;s trying to fight her swelling down--
she said she needed to rest !
and you won &apos;t let her leave for a trip .
how is that being selfish ?
because you only want her around to hold your hand
while you &apos;re writing a paper .
excuse me ?
i like having mom here .
why are you trying to ship her off ?
cause i care about her happiness , that &apos;s why .
try your own .
the only reason you want her to go so bad
is so you can start boffing your teacher again .
it &apos;s hard to get frisky with fitz
when someone &apos;s looking over your shoulder , huh ?
hanna ?
can you help me with these , please ?
so , i heard some kids from school
are going on campus visits this weekend .
you didn &apos;t want to go ?
well , i don &apos;t really like
when the tour guides walk backwards .
it makes me nauseous .
especially if they &apos;re wearing pleated jeans .
fine , hanna .
i don &apos;t need to look at colleges .
i already know where i wanna go .
well , until you get into the fashion institute ,
you might want to have some other choices .
hello ?
hi .
no , i can talk .
i just didn &apos;t expect to hear from you so soon .
can you hang on a second ?
i got you the rice salad you like .
start without me , i &apos;ll be right back .
i don &apos;t understand .
how bad is it ?
you should come to my office first thing in the morning .
ok .
in spite of the divorce and everyting
but do you think your dady &apos;re would cover for your mom
if she was in serious trouble ?
hi . good morning .
i never went to bed .
do you think your dad would still put himself
on the line for your mom if she really needed it ?
i don &apos;t know , han .
yeah , i mean , i think he would .
why ? did you call your dad ?
no , i don &apos;t know if i should .
i mean , what if caleb &apos;s right ?
i don &apos;t want to push my dad to help
and then him just go the other way .
yeah , well , why aren &apos;t you waking up caleb ?
you don &apos;t think i &apos;ve tried ?
he &apos;s camping with his dad .
the closest thing he has to a phone
is an empty can of beans .
what exactly brought all of this on ?
her muddy shoes , they &apos;re gone .
they &apos;re not under the sink .
do you think that &quot; a &quot; took them ?
no , they &apos;re probably just in her closet .
did you look there ?
it &apos;s locked .
god , this is so weird , she never locks her closet .
well , she picked a good time to start .
i gotta go .
okay , just check in with me later , okay ?
bye .
hey , you need me to drop you off at spencer &apos;s ?
oh , i &apos;m good . she &apos;s coming to pick me up .
here .
what &apos;s this ?
gas money . and a little extra .
dad , that &apos;s a lot extra .
well , i want you to enjoy yourself this weekend .
take spencer out for a pizza , my treat .
i &apos;m good . i got paid yesterday .
then take it ,
and buy yourself something you ordinarily wouldn &apos;t .
you know ?
handbag ...
i don &apos;t know .
thanks .
how &apos;s she doing ?
she &apos;s fine .
she &apos;s just tired from the medication .
are you going to go see her ?
yes , i was planning to later .
well , could you sooner than later ?
she needs you .
uh , no she doesn &apos;t .
she needs you to tell her to go to europe .
i do , too .
aria , are you asking me to convince your mother
to run off with her new boyfriend ?
well , that &apos;s not going to happen .
why would you want me to do that ?
because she doesn &apos;t understand
what she &apos;s giving up if she doesn &apos;t go .
wouldn &apos;t you miss her ?
yes , so much .
look she &apos;s only staying here
because she thinks that she has to .
and you &apos;re the only person who can release her from that .
aria ...
your mother is a grown woman
who can make her own decisions .
look , i know that this is a really strange request .
but she values your opinion .
and she still cares a lot about what you think of her .
欢迎来访者
our first stop today is a regents &apos; tea .
head of the humanities department &apos;s gonna be there ,
so if you can casually slip in
a reference to kierkegaard ,
you &apos;ll make his heart go pitter @-@ pat .
you know those sorority scholarships you mentioned earlier ?
how do i get one of those ?
do they require pom @-@ poms ?
no , but there are certain steps
you could take to help yourself get noticed .
i &apos;d be happy to talk more about it .
maybe over a meal ?
yeah , sure .
i &apos;ll get our badges .
cool .
okay , i think you can dial it back .
he doesn &apos;t need to believe
that we actually want to go to this podunk school .
i just need you to help me distract him long enough ,
so that we can track down the number that ali kept calling .
hey , spencer , i --
he &apos;s gonna come back any second . so , here &apos;s the plan .
i &apos;m gonna up jar jar binks
and i need you to occupy brendan
at more with bores or whatever .
first chance you get , brush him off , meet me back here .
got it ?
yeah , okay .
ready to go ?
yeah , actually i need to freshen up .
so , i &apos;m just gonna head back over to the hotel ,
and i will catch up with you guys later , okay ?
okay .
okay .
ta @-@ da .
great .
hi , it &apos;s aria .
leave a message , i &apos;ll call you back .
hello ?
oh , thank god .
hanna , now &apos;s not the time , okay ?
i need answers from a guy who spends his weekends
pretending to be a hufflepuff .
i &apos;ve got to focus here .
no , spencer . i &apos;m bugging out
and i need your help .
i went snooping through my mom &apos;s closet ,
looking for the shoes .
hanna , will you please leave your poor mother alone .
you already gave her a britney shears in your dream ,
what else are you going to do to that woman ?
look , i &apos;ve gotta go .
the number that ali kept calling is in this area code .
if we can find board shorts ,
we can find out what happened to ali .
wish me luck .
no !
spencer , wait ! i--
hi .
i love your shirt .
what can i do for you ?
i was just wondering
if you could tell me
whose number this is .
there &apos;s an automated directory right over there .
okay , but even though it &apos;s a campus number ,
it &apos;s actually unlisted .
i know , right ?
if it &apos;s unlisted , i don &apos;t have it either .
i can &apos;t help you .
you can &apos;t ?
or you won &apos;t ?
look man , i totally get it , okay ?
&quot; you shall not pass . &quot;
the thing is , it &apos;s really important .
so please ?
for all i know that number doesn &apos;t even exist anymore .
it totally exists . i just need to know where .
why ?
it &apos;s personal .
you trying to track down an old boyfriend or something ?
what ? no , why would you even think that ?
i know girls like you .
you got the crazy eyes .
they &apos;re not that crazy .
crazy enough .
fine , let me see that thing .
thank you .
all right , the first three numbers means it &apos;s on campus ,
and the next three numbers means it &apos;s on greek row .
really ? do you know where ?
no ,
at least it gives the poor bastard a fighting chance .
&quot; a lannister always pays his debts . &quot;
you would like the lannisters .
i could give you the entire targaryen speech
from the end of season one ,
but i will not waste my breath .
so , how is it ?
it &apos;s pretty gnarly .
but i decided to take a gamble
and rejoin the human race .
well , you don &apos;t look ... bad .
compared to what ?
bleu cheese ?
um , i spoke with mike this afternoon .
oh , um , byron , it &apos;s a non @-@ issue .
and he understands that you need this time away .
since when ?
since i spoke with him .
this is silly .
i &apos;m the parent of two teenagers .
it &apos;s my job .
and i can cover your shift .
clock some overtime , steal some paperclips .
why ?
because you have spent your entire adult life
taking care of other people .
me being one of them .
and it is time for you to do something for yourself .
and you don &apos;t think it makes me ,
like , the worst mother of the year ?
ella ...
you and i talked about moving to europe
when we were still in college .
and then aria happened .
then mike .
then a mortgage .
and iceland doesn &apos;t count .
you were busy taking care of two teenagers
and one nutty professor .
you &apos;ve been given a second chance .
take it .
look , i &apos;m sorry , okay ?
i lost track of time .
whatever . it &apos;s fine . forget it .
the important thing is we figured out that
the number on ali &apos;s loop is here somewhere .
and that &quot; board shorts &quot; was probably
some frat boy she was having overnights with .
maybe i should have worn something more ladylike .
does this dress look slutty to you ?
not really .
but the sluttier the better .
we have to zero in on the senior brothers .
see if any of them remember ali
or who she was hooking up with that summer .
look , are you sure that this sorority party is the way to go ?
maybe we should just knock on the frat house doors .
there aren &apos;t that many of them .
i want to go to the party , okay ?
yeah , you &apos;re right .
all the guys will probably be there anyways .
ugh , like moths to the flame .
here ...
what &apos;s this ?
emily , it is a photo to jog memories of ali .
i think this was where she was going with the money from hector .
you know , when we get there
we should probably divvy up the workload .
do you want to talk to the deltas or the kappas ?
neither !
look , i know that this is important ,
but can we please put a pin in this ?
i don &apos;t want to do this tonight .
why ? this is the reason we came here .
no , it isn &apos;t !
i came here to talk to sorority sisters about a scholarship .
yeah , that &apos;s right ,
i actually want to get into this &quot; podunk &quot; school .
so you &apos;re not here to help me find a number ?
no . i &apos;m here for me .
okay , well , now it all makes sense .
what makes sense ?
oh , you batting those camel lashes at brendan ,
smiling , laughing at everything he says --
it &apos;s called being nice .
it &apos;s called flirting .
i don &apos;t think brendan confused interest with flirtation .
well , i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;m not confused about .
the fact that this entire weekend
you &apos;ve conveniently failed to mention that you &apos;re gay !
no , you didn &apos;t .
i just didn &apos;t think that you were the type of person
who would lead somebody on just to get what you wanted .
nice coming from the girl who whipped off her bra
to get back on the decathlon team .
okay , i wasn &apos;t leading him on .
i was being charming !
could have fooled me .
you wouldn &apos;t know the difference .
you &apos;ve never had to be charming .
you get to act like a total snot @-@ rag ,
&apos;cause mommy and daddy
have a safety net of cash to catch your fall !
* sisters of zeta chi *
* the apple of god &apos;s eye *
* your light burns bright *
* when all the brothers see *
* they &apos;ll be on bended knee *
* sisters of gamma zee *
* our hearts unite *
hanna ?
where are you going ?
i didn &apos;t know that you were home .
um , i &apos;m going to meet emily and spencer .
i was just going to call you from the car .
what are you doing that requires luggage ?
a campus visit .
cicero college .
i thought you said you weren &apos;t
interested in liberal arts colleges .
yeah , well , like you said
i should probably start thinking of other options .
i &apos;m just gonna call you when i get there , okay ?
okay .
honey ?
be safe .
so the first year you have a communal ,
but after that you can petition to get a single .
cool . so , how do i apply ?
well , first you &apos;ll have to meet with all the sisters .
oh , that .
that was the grunwald &apos;s .
what &apos;s a &quot; grunwald &quot; ?
mrs. grunwald .
our former house mother .
she was before my time .
but legend has it she was fired .
did it have something to do with that ?
maybe .
apparently you couldn &apos;t get anything past that bitch .
one girl said it was like
she knew you were gonna sneak out
before you even got the idea yourself .
anyways ...
let me show you our den .
we just got a new flat screen .
excuse me , you wouldn &apos;t happen to know this girl would you ?
uh @-@ uh . no ?
thanks .
sorry , hey , do you happen to know this girl ?
oh , thank you .
hey .
oh , hey .
i ...
i think i just saw spencer in one of the rooms .
i wasn &apos;t looking for spencer .
i &apos;m off @-@ duty for the night .
can i get you a drink ?
sure .
&apos;sup ?
it &apos;s not about you .
could you look at this photo
and let me know if you know this girl ?
yeah , i &apos;ve seen this girl .
really ?
yeah , in my dreams .
thank you .
morons .
it &apos;s the same prefix .
spencer !
hanna ?
what are you doing here ?
looking for you ! where &apos;s emily ?
i have no idea .
well , didn &apos;t you come together ?
yeah , thought so .
well , i need both of you now .
why ?
hanna , what &apos;s going on ?
what ?
is that real ?
why would you bring a gun to a sorority party ?
because it &apos;s the gun .
that killed wilden .
at least i think it is .
why do you have that ? !
because i found it .
in my mom &apos;s closet .
i have to get rid of it .
get rid of it ?
hanna , no , you have to give it back to your father .
and let my dad turn my mom in to the cops ? no way .
i don &apos;t think he &apos;d to that .
i &apos;m not giving him the choice .
it &apos;s better to dump it here , miles away from rosewood .
that way when the police question him ,
