must be good to be home again , sir .
yeah .
well , we &apos;ll see about that .
good afternoon .
i &apos;m here to see assistant director harold cooper .
do you have an appointment ?
i do not .
tell him it &apos;s raymond reddington .
ressler . washington field office .
i &apos;m the case agent on reddington .
第一季第一集
when did this happen ?
under an hour ago .
we confirm it &apos;s actually him ?
it &apos;s him all right . prints match . tattoos .
he even volunteered classified
details about a brussels mission in &apos; 08 .
what happened in brussels ?
sir ?
we tried to kill him , sir .
it really is him .
came in with a briefcase
containing every alias he &apos;s ever used .
most of &apos; em we &apos;ve never even heard of .
what does he want ?
don &apos;t know . won &apos;t talk .
he &apos;s a stone .
call lab services .
have them fit him with an alphachip rfid tag .
assemble a full intel review .
nsa . cia .
what exactly do you want to know ?
everything .
raymond &quot; red &quot; reddington attended the naval academy .
top of his class . graduated by the time he was 24 .
he was being groomed for admiral .
then in 1990 , reddington &apos;s coming home
to see his wife and his daughter for christmas .
he never arrives .
this highly respected officer
up and disappears from the face of the earth--
until four years later
when classified noforn documents start showing up in maghreb ,
islamabad , beijing .
these leaks were traced to reddington .
this guy &apos;s an equal opportunity offender ,
a facilitator of sorts ,
who &apos;s built an enterprise brokering deals
for fellow criminals .
he has no country .
he has no political agenda .
reddington &apos;s only allegiance is to the highest bidder .
they call him something in the papers .
&quot; the concierge of crime . &quot;
he &apos;s online .
evidently someone with the authority
to make decisions has arrived .
i think i smell the stench of your cologne , agent cooper .
smells like hubris .
get these feeds fixed . i want him up here . come on .
you must have many questions ,
so let &apos;s begin with the most important one-- why i &apos;m here .
remember the 1986 attack
on the u.s. embassy in damascus ,
the abduction of the six foreign nationals
from the french consulate in algiers in &apos; 97,
or the 2002 breach of the krungthai bank in bangkok ?
you see these events as unrelated .
i can tell you one man is responsible for all three .
his name is ranko zamani .
you want him . i want him .
so let &apos;s say for the moment our interests are aligned .
ranko sinisa zamani .
serbian national educated in the u.s.
ranko zamani &apos;s been dead for six years .
he &apos;s a non @-@ existent threat .
then a dead man
just stepped off united 283 from munich to dulles .
he entered the country under the name sacha m. chacko .
cleared customs at 10 : 56 a.m.
listen up , people .
the lab just pulled a latent print from the airline arm rest .
nine points of comparison .
zamani &apos;s alive .
you have my attention .
were you wrong ?
i was wrong .
yes , you were wrong .
at least it &apos;s not the first time . familiar territory .
now , i &apos;ll give you zamani , but first--
no &quot; but firsts . &quot; you don &apos;t decide anything .
agent cooper , you &apos;ve overestimated your authority .
i said i &apos;ll help you find zamani , and i will .
but from this point forward ,
there &apos;s one very important rule :
i speak only with elizabeth keen .
who the hell &apos;s elizabeth keen ?
oh , buddy .
seriously , dude ?
babe , what time is it ?
i don &apos;t know .
what time you gotta be there ?
oh , crap .
what &apos;s up ?
crap !
what ?
no ! my first day !
babe , are you good ? you need help ?
i missed the bus , babe .
i &apos;m gonna need to take the car .
you can &apos;t take the car . i need the car .
i &apos;ve got field trip planning committee .
you took the dog out , right ?
i did .
for the field trip :
air and space or the d.c. zoo ?
the zoo &apos;s gender neutral .
all right .
good thinkin &apos; . we &apos;re out of milk .
oop . sorry .
is this pee ?
i &apos;m standing in pee , babe .
he &apos;s your dog , too .
ok , yeah , thanks a lot .
i &apos;m gonna smell like a urinary tract infection
on my first day !
hey , don &apos;t forget
we got the last adoption meeting today .
one @-@ thirty .
hey , you heard me , right ? one @-@ thirty .
yep . one @-@ thirty . last meeting .
i &apos;m in the car . you got the keys ?
yeah , in my pocket .
i got your coffee .
no more peeing , dude .
what ?
we both woke up seven minutes ago .
i &apos;m pretty sure my pants are on backwards
and i can barely see straight .
but you are somehow dressed ,
composed ,
and as beautiful as the day i met you .
i think i &apos;m forgetting something .
yeah .
you know i &apos;m not gonna let this job
come between us and our family , right ?
i know .
we want a family , we &apos;re going to have a family .
wait . were you serious about that kid thing ?
because i got stuff goin--
mama .
today &apos;s the day .
yeah , i know .
man , i am so proud of you .
thanks .
you worked so hard for this .
are you nervous ?
no . but i am very late .
agent keen .
donald ressler .
washington field office .
i need you to come with me right away .
babe , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m gonna need to take the car .
agent keen . am i getting that right ?
yes , sir .
harold cooper .
assistant director of counterterrorism .
yes , sir . i know who you are , sir .
so , uh ... can you tell us what &apos;s going on ?
i wish i could .
i can tell you that ...
i &apos;ve been vetted by the agency like everyone else ,
you know , same background checks , psych profiles .
i &apos;m sure opr &apos;s trolling my digital footprint right now ,
and i can tell you what they &apos;ll find .
what will they find ?
nothing . i have no history with reddington .
they tell me today &apos;s your first day as a profiler .
yes , sir .
i was reassigned from new york .
i graduated quantico last month .
congratulations .
thank you .
do me a favor . profile yourself .
i &apos;m sorry , sir ?
who are you ? what is he looking for ?
profile elizabeth keen .
oh . okay .
um , well , i &apos;ve been with the bureau for four years .
i was the head of the mobile emergency psych unit in new york .
we worked murders ,
extortion--
read your resume .
of course .
my colleagues call me &quot; sir . &quot;
they think i &apos;m ...
a bitch .
like most kids who raised themselves ,
i can display narcissistic behavior .
i can be withdrawn , disconnected .
i have a deep yearning to
understand and relate to the criminal mind .
i &apos;m board certified in forensic psychology ,
and yet i operate under the delusion
that i can rewrite my past by having kids of my own .
do you find it odd reddington surrendered himself
the day you started working as a profiler ?
i think that it suggests he was waiting for me .
why you ? specifically .
because i &apos;m new
and he thinks i can be easily manipulated .
the man obviously doesn &apos;t know me very well .
what is this place ?
d.c. metro sorting facility , u.s. postal service .
it was abandoned and slated for demo twelve years ago .
the bureau acquired the building post @-@ 9 / 11 .
been operating a variety of covert operations here ever since .
so this is a black site ?
we &apos;re sentimental . we prefer to call it the post office .
if you need anything , remember ...
we &apos;re right here .
agent keen , what a pleasure .
well ...
i &apos;m here .
you got rid of your highlights .
you look much less baltimore .
do you get back home much ?
tell me about zamani .
i haven &apos;t been home in years .
why involve me ? i &apos;m nobody .
it &apos;s my first day .
nothin &apos; special about me .
oh , i think you &apos;re very special .
within the hour , ranko zamani will abduct
the daughter of u.s. general daniel ryker .
there &apos;ll be some kind of diversion ,
communications will be scrambled ,
then he &apos;ll grab the girl .
he wants to be out of the country within 36 hours .
if you don &apos;t move quickly , she will die .
that &apos;s what i know .
and how do you know this ?
because i &apos;m the one who got him into the country .
and i &apos;m supposed to believe you ?
no , of course not !
i &apos;m a criminal . criminals are notorious liars .
everything about me is a lie .
but if anyone can give me a second chance , it &apos;s you .
the two of us have ... overcome so much .
i mean , look at you .
abandoned by a father who was a career criminal ,
a mother who died of ... weakness and shame .
and yet here you are , about to make a name for yourself ,
about to ... capture ranko zamani .
i &apos;m gonna make you famous , lizzy .
what did you tell him ?
what are you talking about ?
how did he know those things ? private things about my family ?
why didn &apos;t your father &apos;s criminal record
show up on your background report ?
i think we need to contact
the swat commander at quantico .
roll a team out to the girl .
this is nonsense . he &apos;s bluffing , sir .
no , he &apos;s establishing value .
i &apos;ve been the case agent on this guy for five years .
trust me--
and five years has gotten you what ?
you asked me here , you asked my opinion .
here it is : that girl &apos;s gonna get taken .
excuse me .
领养机构
tom . thank god you picked up .
hey , tell me you &apos;re close . what &apos;s going on ?
are you close ?
that helicopter ,
they flew me to the assistant director ,
put me on a case , and i can &apos;t get away right now .
you &apos;re kidding , right ?
the adoption people , they &apos;re all waiting .
liz , are you there ?
put on a great show in there .
you better pull yourself together
because you just called in the cavalry .
can i just have one minute , um--
we don &apos;t have a minute . come on .
let &apos;s go .
i &apos;m sorry . i know we had an appointment ,
but there &apos;s a girl , something happened--
i @-@ i can &apos;t tell you . it &apos;s classified .
this whole ... day is classified .
lizzy ... lizzy , babe , if-- if it &apos;s too much ,
we don &apos;t have to do this right now , okay ?
we don &apos;t have to do it . we &apos;ll just-- we &apos;ll do it next year .
but if we are gonna go through with this ,
you gotta do it with me .
i can &apos;t do it alone , lizzy .
we gotta go .
no . no . tom , listen ,
our family is the only thing that matters , okay ?
it &apos;s the only thing that matters .
okay .
all right , let me , uh ...
let me handle it , i &apos;ll , um , i &apos;ll take care of it .
i think this woman might punch me in the face , but i got it .
i am so sorry .
don &apos;t be sorry , just be safe , okay ?
i love you .
i love you too .
sir .
at ease .
we have a situation , sir .
it &apos;s about your daughter .
my daughter ?
guys , with the guns , please .
we don &apos;t want to scare the kids .
i got this .
beth . sweetie , this lady needs to speak to you .
hi , bethany , don &apos;t be scared .
i just need you to come with me , okay ?
thank you .
your name &apos;s beth , right ?
my name &apos;s beth , too .
i &apos;m elizabeth .
my friends call me liz , though .
you can call me liz if you want .
my daddy has a pin like that .
oh , yeah ? i bet your daddy has lots of medals .
to get a pin like this you gotta be really brave .
this can be your special pin , okay ?
there you go .
you like it ?
you don &apos;t have to--
thank you so much . this is beautiful .
the bull &apos;s pokey . be careful .
okay , i &apos;ll be careful .
what &apos;s going on ?
hey , what &apos;s going on up there ?
hazmat has the road closed . we &apos;ll be turning around .
rolling thunder to follow 1 .
be advised we have a chemical spill ahead .
copy that . proceeding to alternate route .
do you want to call your daddy ?
yeah , i want to tell him i &apos;m okay .
okay .
back up !
are you okay ?
i think so .
tango , tango , tango , respond !
i can &apos;t see ! i got blood in my--
get the girl !
if you want to save the girl , do not fire your weapon .
take it .
okay , baby , this smoke &apos;s gonna hurt us .
all right ? i need you to put this on for me .
what about you ?
there &apos;s only one .
it &apos;s for you , hon . okay , listen to me .
these men are gonna come
and they &apos;re gonna take you .
are they gonna hurt me ?
they &apos;re not gonna hurt you , honey .
i &apos;m gonna find you , okay ?
okay .
beth , i &apos;m gonna find you .
where &apos;s the girl ?
it &apos;s been 4 hours , your people haven &apos;t made any demands .
my people ? i told you zamani would take the girl .
i told you that &apos;s all i knew .
this is in your hands now .
i need your help with zamani .
how about a trade ?
you tell me and i &apos;ll tell you .
tell me about the scar on your palm .
i &apos;ve noticed how you stroke it .
there was a fire . i was fourteen .
someone tried to hurt you .
not exactly , no .
may i see it ?
is a child really what you want ?
how on earth--
but a baby won &apos;t fix what happened in the past .
you lost the right to speak about parenthood
when you abandoned your wife and daughter on christmas eve .
the girl .
you won &apos;t find the girl
until you learn to look at this differently .
and how should i look at this ?
like a criminal .
may come easier than you think .
shall i show you ?
well , at least you know what zamani looks like .
oh , my goodness !
i haven &apos;t seen him in years .
very interesting fellow .
completely unrelated to this .
you &apos;re pointing at the wrong guy here .
miroslav .
they call him the chemist .
hey , you can &apos;t just
a highly regarded munitions expert .
he left mit to work for the russian , vor usoyan .
last two years ... very expensive freelancer .
i don &apos;t know what the hell any of this is .
ooh , the german .
a banker . name &apos;s reinhardt .
he &apos;s most likely moving the money .
what about the girl ?
what do you have on the girl and her father ?
your 36 @-@ hour timeline would suggest a singular event .
something in d.c.
i &apos;m not sure how the girl fits .
what about the chemist ?
important ... well paid ...
whatever zamani &apos;s planning is expensive .
some sort of attack ?
you &apos;re thinking like a cop .
cops are so objective .
they &apos;re obligated to protocols . make it personal .
okay , this is nonsense .
zamani &apos;s sick . cia says he carries nipah virus .
dying makes him dangerous .
so what does he desperately want before he dies ?
and how does that relate to the little girl ?
her father , the general , spent time in bosnia ...
supporting nato troops in the bihac pocket region .
zamani &apos;s home .
he bombed a chemical weapons facility ...
poisoning the village .
it &apos;s about his family .
they died , zamani survived .
he wants revenge .
he hired the chemist to build a bomb , detonate it in washington .
he &apos;s gonna use beth to settle the score ...
deliver the bomb .
okay , let &apos;s move .
we &apos;re on a clock .
i have an acquaintance .
they call him the innkeeper , runs a series of safe houses .
lean on him . he &apos;ll know where to find the chemist .
you find the chemist , you &apos;ll find zamani .
where is this innkeeper ?
if i tell you , you have to give me something in return .
no more restraints , no more cages .
if you want to capture zamani ,
he has to believe i &apos;m moving freely--
in touch with old friends ,
staying in one of my favorite hotels ...
if you think we &apos;re gonna put you up at the sheraton--
save your starwood points , harold .
the sheraton &apos;s not my scene .
hey , live it up , pal .
soon as this is over , you &apos;re headed back to a black site .
mr. homan , it &apos;s awfully nice to have you back .
there &apos;s complimentary champagne .
as usual , the bed &apos;s made up with blankets instead of a comforter .
will there be anything else ?
no , thank you , eric .
tip the gentleman , will you ?
where is the chemist ?
fbi . hands .
tranquilo , papi .
get to the wall .
* how lucky can one guy be . *
* i kissed her and she kissed me . *
* like the fella once said . *
* ain &apos;t that a kick in the head ? *
they found the lab .
they &apos;re interrogating the chemist as we speak .
what about the bomb ?
we think that we got there
before he built it .
i gotta get out of here and clear my head .
take a shower , see my husband .
don &apos;t go too far .
oh , my--
did they say yes ?
oh , baby ! how did you do this ?
oh , my god , i cannot believe--
we &apos;re gonna have a baby , and this is exac--
tom ?
sit down .
sit down ! ! !
do what i say or i &apos;ll shoot your husband .
see , tom and i , we have been talking ,
trying to figure out how you knew i was in town .
aahh .... i tell him
you figure out my plan ...
to take the general &apos;s daughter .
tom , look at me .
make for nice surprise .
but my people handle quite well , i think .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
but then , your people come for my chemist friend .
i was finished with the chemist ,
so you saved me payment for services .
and for that , i thank you .
but ... it did make me wonder
what else you know .
what else do you know ?
i don &apos;t--
tom .
no , no , no , no , no . over here .
i ask question .
what else do you know about my plan ?
a bomb . maybe . we don &apos;t know .
we only knew about the girl . the rest is just speculation .
tom , baby , it &apos;s gonna be okay .
you son of a bitch !
what else do you know about my plan ? !
nothing ! i swear !
my god .
you &apos;re not as smart as reddington says .
my friend , he is always so obsessed with you .
i &apos;m not sure why .
it &apos;s gonna be okay .
now , what i have planned will make for many casualties .
so now you have choice .
stop me now and save many americans ,
or save only ...
one .
what do you choose ?
tom . baby .
oh , my god . baby , keep your eyes open .
i &apos;m gonna get help .
i &apos;m gonna get help .
don &apos;t fall aslee--
you &apos;re gonna be okay !
you &apos;re gonna be okay .
911 . what is your emergency ?
did you send him ?
are you the one who did this ?
did what ?
he was in my house !
my husband is on a ventilator
because zamani came--
calm down and tell me what happened .
don &apos;t play stupid . you &apos;re the only thing connecting us .
he told me that you &apos;re obsessed with me .
did he mention the girl or the bomb ?
we &apos;re not a team .
zamani .
i &apos;m not your partner .
what did he say ?
i don &apos;t know , he said--
he said something about casualties ...
and chemical agents , and--
he talked about you .
he even thanked me for getting rid of the chemist .
so the bomb &apos;s still in play .
why the hell was he in my house ? !
tell me ! you know him !
why is my husband dying in a hospital right now ? !
the truth is , despite your feelings ,
your husband doesn &apos;t matter .
zamani did you a favor , lizzy .
now , you know i just punched a hole in your carotid .
best chance , one minute before you pass out .
so here &apos;s how it &apos;s gonna work .
you tell me how i find zamani and make this right ,
or i let you die right here .
understand ?
yeah .
but if i die ...
you &apos;ll never know the truth about your husband .
you know nothing about my husband .
agent ressler ?
i gotta talk to him .
you shouldn &apos;t even be here .
you &apos;re under official review . you know that .
i know . the chemist isn &apos;t talking , is he ?
no .
red knows zamani . just give me five minutes .
thank you .
he &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s good to see you , old friend .
initiating track .
okay , got him .
his chip indicates he &apos;s at the lincoln memorial .
we &apos;re on him . forty seconds out . en route .
how did things go with agent keen ?
paid her a visit , like you asked .
and the husband ?
like you asked .
it &apos;s a shame you &apos;re gonna miss the cherry blossoms .
i think a great many people will miss the cherry blossoms .
tell me , the general &apos;s daughter is such a risk .
this is about much more than one girl .
he &apos;s on the move . heading westbound .
this is about ...
the children .
raymond , today ...
on this day ...
i am giving their plague back to them .
in sixty years they will be talking about this day ...
about my legacy .
still heading west .
300 yards from your position .
hello ?
there &apos;s a wrinkle .
zamani wants more than the general &apos;s daughter .
he &apos;s after children .
where are you ?
approaching 14th .
you gotta move ! you gotta move !
i need you to tell me what zamani said .
in the house--
what did he say ,
what did you see ?
he , uh , he asked about the chemist and about the girl .
no . what did you see ?
uh , there was blood .
there was blood everywhere .
take a breath , lizzy .
over here .
there was a tattoo .
he &apos;s serbian orthodox .
you &apos;re closing on him .
he wouldn &apos;t have a tattoo .
i know what i saw .
this mark , i &apos;ve seen it before .
for the field trip . d.c. air and space
or the d.c. zoo ?
it wasn &apos;t a tattoo .
it was a stamp .
zamani &apos;s gonna bomb the d.c. zoo .
i got nothin &apos; . come on , where is he ? !
he &apos;s turning onto maryland ave .
dead ahead . he &apos;s dead ahead .
he &apos;s stopped .
the signal has stopped . he &apos;s right there .
where is he ? !
he should be right behind you .
moving vertically .
are there stairs near you ?
beth ?
hi , honey . are you hurt ?
no .
are you alone ?
he said to wait here for my daddy .
he said not to take it off .
whatever you do , don &apos;t touch it .
there &apos;s less than three minutes .
i &apos;ve got to evacuate , call the bomb squad---
your people will never be there in time .
my friend , he &apos;s on his way .
your friend . what friend ?
reddington !
reddington !
hands in the air .
zamani .
step down from the ledge .
hands where i can see &apos; em or i &apos;ll shoot you down !
tell the general his daughter was ...
an unfortunate civilian casualty .
he pulled the tracking chip .
son of a bitch .
did reddington send you ?
i can &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying .
can you stop the bomb ?
can you stop it ?
are we gonna be okay ?
yeah , baby , we &apos;re gonna be okay .
hey . i was scared when i was your age , too .
but i had a secret weapon to keep me safe .
my daddy gave it to me .
it &apos;s very special . i &apos;ve never shown it to anybody .
like magic .
what does it do ?
whenever i &apos;m feeling sad or afraid ,
i just touch it like this , and it makes me brave .
do you want to see if it can make you brave ?
yeah ?
you &apos;re a brave girl .
wait .
wait !
what are you doing ? !
just consider the device his payment for services .
that is a chemical weapon !
he &apos;s fascinated by the things .
he certainly has more use for it than we do .
daddy !
red vest , gray sweatshirt ! he &apos;s got the bomb !
we &apos;re gonna make a great team .
who is the ukrainian ?
i &apos;m not gonna tell you .
you gave him a chemical weapon .
he took it .
that &apos;s the price of doing business , harold ,
with certain people who can get certain things done .
you know that .
you never look at the larger picture .
the bomb didn &apos;t detonate , the girl is safe ,
zamani &apos;s dead .
frankly , i think this all went down rather swimmingly .
this was never about zamani .
you surrendered and infiltrated the fbi
to get at our intelligence .
your intelligence ?
to get that weapon .
i certainly don &apos;t want your intelligence , agent ressler .
i &apos;m quite happy with my own .
i think it &apos;s more likely that i tried to help you in good faith
and had to finish the job myself because ...
you couldn &apos;t .
i think we &apos;re finished .
well , this was fun . let &apos;s do it again .
really , let &apos;s do it again .
understand , zamani was only the first .
the first what ?
name . on the list .
what list ?
let &apos;s called the blacklist . that sounds exciting .
that &apos;s why we &apos;re all here , of course . my wish list .
a list i &apos;ve been cultivating for over twenty years .
politicians , mobsters , hackers ...
spies .
we have our own list .
agent ressler , please .
we all know your top ten
is little more than a publicity campaign .
it &apos;s a popularity contest at best .
i &apos;m talking about the criminals who matter .
the ones you can &apos;t find
because you don &apos;t even know they exist .
zamani was a small fish .
i &apos;m ahab .
and if you want the whales my list ,
you have to play by my rules .
i never sleep in the same
location for more than two nights in a row .
i want a fully encrypted 8 @-@ millimeter tag embedded in my neck--
not that garbage from alphachip you stuck in my shoulder .
i want my own security .
i &apos;ve compiled a list of five acceptable applicants .
pick two .
whatever i tell you falls under an immunity package
that i negotiate myself .
and finally , most importantly ,
i speak only with elizabeth keen .
* daylight come . *
* daylight go . *
* how far will it reach ? *
* ain &apos;t nobody know . *
* i used the state of the art *
* technology *
* suppose to make for better living . *
* and a better human being *
* and i &apos;m straining to remember *
* just what means to be alive . *
you &apos;ve discovered something curious about your ...
husband , haven &apos;t you , lizzy ?
* if your having girl problems *
* i feel bad for you , son . *
* i got 99 problems *
* but a bitch ain &apos;t one ... *
