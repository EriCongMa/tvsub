i broke into peter &apos;s safe .
i had the list in my hand .
i was ready to take the treasure and go .
then why didn &apos;t you ?
i have a life here .
i run on this ,
and new york is just a memory for me .
he stole a raphael !
conjecture , your honor .
and i pursued .
and i haven &apos;t forgotten about the raphael .
neal coded his letters .
and we cracked it .
don &apos;t know what they mean yet , but we will .
i &apos;m -- - agent kramer .
head of the bureau &apos;s d.c. art crimes unit .
so you &apos;re the one who taught peter everything he knows .
i &apos;d say this moment was inevitable , mr. caffrey .
neal &apos;s my c.i.
he &apos;s also a friend .
you think once a con , always a con ?
i think you have to protect yourself when they fall .
you have the treasure .
i didn &apos;t steal it .
you son of a bitch !
i don &apos;t care . you have it .
where is it ?
it was here .
he already moved it .
mozzie ? of course it was mozzie .
i didn &apos;t think he &apos;d move it this fast .
what is it ?
this is a letter from the u.s. probation office .
&quot; because of your outstanding service ,
&quot; including recovering the treasure
&quot; and catching keller ,
&quot; the u.s. probation office is convening a hearing
to discuss the commutation of your sentence . &quot;
what &apos;s that mean ?
it means no anklet .
no nothing .
you could be a free man .
state your name for the record , please .
neal george caffrey .
mr. caffrey , do you understand why you &apos;re sitting here today ?
i do .
the u.s. attorney has petitioned a rule 35 motion
on my behalf , which , if granted ,
would commute my sentence and set about my own recognizance .
in essence , you want to know if i &apos;ve earned my freedom .
you &apos;ve done your homework .
yes , ma &apos;am .
you &apos;ve already served two years of a four @-@ year sentence
under the supervision of special agent peter burke .
yes , ma &apos;am .
while confined to a tracking anklet ,
you &apos;ve helped agent burke clear
an impressive 94 % conviction rate .
we work well together .
it would seem so .
the recent arrest of matthew keller ,
one of the fbi &apos;s top 10 most wanted fugitives ,
the recovery of a priceless collection of artwork he stole
you are the poster boy for reform .
who would have thought ?
you came into this legal system as a criminal .
the question before this board today is -- have you changed ?
i believe i have .
over the next two days ,
we &apos;ll be interviewing some of your closest acquaintances
and colleagues .
then we &apos;ll have you back to make a final statement ,
at which time agent burke
will give his summary recommendation .
any questions ?
no , ma &apos;am .
but may i say that the last two years of my life
have been the best --
you &apos;ll have time for all that two days from now .
yes , ma &apos;am .
this is impressive , mr. caffrey .
i hope the real you lives up to who you are on paper .
i hope to exceed your expectation .
you &apos;re free to go .
&quot; free to go . &quot;
quite an inspiring turn of phrase .
except &quot; you &apos;re free to stay &quot; might be more appropriate .
how &apos;s it looking ?
flip a coin .
regardless of what the committee decides ,
this is my home now .
and i am right beside you .
make a brand @-@ new start of it in old new york .
well , when you make that brand @-@ new start ,
i &apos;ve got a surprise .
what kind of surprise ?
a huge one .
makes canis majoris look like a night light .
but i will say no more .
i &apos;ll ask no more .
there seems to be someone missing
from your commutation witness list .
yeah , sorry about that ,
but having a known felon speak for me
doesn &apos;t qualify as a good character reference .
i am a felon , but i &apos;m not known --
at least in bureaucratic circles .
i stand corrected .
but i &apos;ve already got plenty of people on my side .
elizabeth , june ... sara .
really ?
yeah .
good . what about the demi @-@ suits ?
mm . jones and diana ? wild cards .
and the suit himself ?
well , considering everything that &apos;s happened --
with the treasure , with keller --
peter could go either way .
think he &apos;s decided ?
i don &apos;t know .
hold on .
agent kramer , the d.c. art crimes grand @-@ p√®re --
he &apos;s speaking ?
kramer was supposed to submit a written report
on behalf of the bureau .
if he &apos;s speaking in person , that &apos;s more than a formality .
well , what does that do to your chances ?
well , i can &apos;t imagine it improves them .
you know what ? worst @-@ case scenario , he says no ,
and i stay on the anklet with peter .
well , behind every worst @-@ case scenario ,
there &apos;s a worse worst @-@ case scenario .
isn &apos;t there a child
whose balloon you need to pop somewhere ?
yeah . negativity -- force of habit .
i &apos;m ... sure it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
yeah . nothing .
come on in .
smells good in here .
yeah . el &apos;s been baking .
a commutation cake .
yeah , i told her it was a little premature .
hey , honey . i got that other cake .
wait till you see it .
&quot; hang in there . &quot;
little cat with an anklet .
consolation cake .
rum ?
lots of rum .
that &apos;ll be good .
yes .
well , for what it &apos;s worth ,
i &apos;m actually voting for cake number one .
i appreciate that .
you guys talk .
so , have you decided ?
what i &apos;m gonna say ? honestly ...
no . i haven &apos;t .
so , what &apos;s so important you couldn &apos;t call ?
why is kramer speaking at my hearing ?
don &apos;t let that put you on edge .
peter , i &apos;m staring at two cakes here .
one celebrates my fate ,
the other seals it -- i am on edge .
why is he here ?
i don &apos;t know . for whatever reason ,
kramer has decided to keep me out of the loop on this .
he &apos;s keeping you out ?
yeah .
but i &apos;ve got an inside man .
how &apos;d it go with kramer ?
he had me digging through files till 3 : 00 a.m.
what &apos;s he trying to prove ?
i don &apos;t know .
when he talks about caffrey ,
he talks about him in glowing terms .
i noticed that .
he seems to respect the hell out of him .
but he &apos;s digging into the coded letters
neal sent kate from prison .
and now that kramer &apos;s cracked the code ,
he &apos;s convinced he &apos;ll find something .
yeah . but what ?
petey !
how are you ?
i &apos;m good .
it &apos;s an interesting place to set up shop .
you sure you wouldn &apos;t be more comfortable in an office ?
well , i don &apos;t want to intrude on someone else &apos;s house .
and this lets me spread out .
and this is the room where we find the truth .
that &apos;s how it &apos;s supposed to work .
i need to stretch my legs .
walk with me .
you &apos;ve got something on your mind ?
you &apos;re still pulling neal &apos;s casework .
is there something going on i should know about ?
matter of fact , there is . i &apos;m worried about you , pete .
you &apos;re worried ?
yeah . the music box , garrett fowler , e u @-@ boat .
these 515s read more like pulp fiction
than case summaries .
what are you saying ?
well , you know what i &apos;m saying .
you &apos;re covering for him .
well , you &apos;re not ?
it &apos;s complicated .
if anyone gets it , i do .
he &apos;s your friend .
he is , phil .
and i want to make sure he &apos;s not gonna hurt you .
you want him back behind bars ?
no , pete .
he &apos;s much too valuable for that .
meaning ?
i want neal working for me. in d.c.
when did you first meet neal caffrey ?
the day he was released from prison .
they had sent him to this horrible little fleabag motel .
and you had no qualms about taking in a convicted felon ?
absolutely not . not neal .
you see , after my husband passed ,
i ... i was living in this big , empty house .
and ... neal changed all of that .
i think of him as a blessing .
byron and i always wanted a son .
i wish he was still alive ...
so that he could finally meet him .
ms. ellington , in your opinion ,
does neal caffrey deserve for his sentence to be commuted ?
of course .
yes .
and you must let him go free .
how &apos;d it go ?
i nailed it .
nice .
what are you thinking ?
i &apos;m thinking we need a third cake .
one with a file in it ?
one that says &quot; bon voyage . &quot;
kramer doesn &apos;t want to put neal away .
he wants to keep him for himself in d.c.
he &apos;d take neal away from you ?
for my own good , but that &apos;s not ...
what is it ?
one night , from sunset to sunrise ,
i gave neal full immunity
to tell me everything he &apos;d ever done .
wow . and he did ?
boy , he did .
but he has full immunity .
it was my immunity , not the bureau &apos;s .
if kramer digs up these things
neal could get the maximum .
forget d.c. forget the anklet .
he could go back to prison .
for a long , long time .
have you told him ?
no .
hon ...
i can &apos;t .
when neal &apos;s threatened , he gets in even more trouble .
talk to kramer . he &apos;s your friend .
he doesn &apos;t know the pandora &apos;s box he &apos;s opening .
i &apos;m just skimming monday &apos;s caseload ,
trying to get a head start .
this grabowska insurance fraud looks pretty promising .
i like that attitude .
i wondered how long it would be
before you came back to see me .
philip . we need to talk .
i suppose we do .
what do you have on neal ?
that &apos;s not what this is about .
neal needs boundaries .
i know that .
you do ?
i told you about my c.i. my &quot; neal . &quot;
yeah . you were close .
we were more than close . he was like a son .
hell , i thought i &apos;d brought him all the way around ,
but he couldn &apos;t change who he was .
well , you know , just because you slapped cuffs on your c.i.
doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;ll have to do the same to neal .
you know the story of the frog and the scorpion ?
neal &apos;s the scorpion .
he can &apos;t help who he is . but he will sting you .
and you &apos;ll both drown .
in d.c. , i can keep an eye on him .
what happens in two years , when he &apos;s a free man ?
who &apos;s to say he will be ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;re after .
you want to use whatever you find
to extend his sentence indefinitely .
it &apos;s best for all concerned .
phil --
he gets to do what he &apos;s so damn good at ,
and he won &apos;t end up being locked away or worse .
i don &apos;t think he should go free .
you mean that ?
i do .
until this moment , i didn &apos;t , but no .
sara .
neal should not go free .
in two years time , when his sentence is over ,
he &apos;s earned that right to decide his own life .
peter ...
and until then , neal &apos;s staying here , with me .
kramer is going to subpoena my files ?
that means i was close to the raphael .
yes .
i knew it ! you stole it !
you caught me .
neal !
this is so great !
i &apos;ve spent years looking for that painting .
how close was i ?
kramer cracked a coded letter that i wrote in prison
that includes a partial address of where i hid it .
so you think i have the other part ?
i know you do .
my god . i was so close .
yes , you were .
well , we already paid out that claim years ago .
you owe sterling bosch $ 15 million .
if i stay out of prison , i will work it off .
so , a coded address in a prison letter --
that seems kind of chancy .
i left off the zip code .
and the address is on main street .
you know how many main streets there are ?
probably thousands .
19,364 -- at the time .
so the address kramer found means nothing .
unless he gets his hands on that zip code .
is this what you &apos;re looking for ?
yes , it is .
roosevelt island ?
i found this digging through a boozy courier &apos;s trash .
i knew i shouldn &apos;t have given up this lead .
is this the only copy ?
no . we keep electronic copies of everything on the server .
so i can &apos;t just throw this one away .
no .
and i &apos;ve been locked out .
excuse me .
can i help you out , sir ?
we &apos;re here to serve a subpoena .
we need all the files related
to raphael &apos;s saint george and the dragon .
fbi .
sterling bosch .
this is sara ellis speaking .
ms. ellis .
special agent kramer , fbi .
agent kramer ! what can i do to help you , sir ?
my agents are serving a subpoena at your office for all
the files to related raphael &apos;s saint george and the dragon .
what the hell am i supposed to do ?
just buy me some time .
well , sir , you must have heard .
heard what ?
we recovered the painting this morning .
you recovered the raphael this morning ?
i was told to keep it under wraps
as we &apos;re still working out the details .
well , where &apos;s the painting now ?
with our authenticator .
good .
i &apos;ll be there myself to take possession of the painting
by end of business today .
and i hope you &apos;re telling me the truth .
because if it &apos;s not there by 6 : 00,
i &apos;ll be charging you with obstruction of justice .
yes , sir .
i bought you six hours .
if that painting isn &apos;t in my hands by the end of the day--
it will be .
has your personal relationship with mr. caffrey
influenced your testimony today ?
yes . most definitely .
this isn &apos;t the first time
you &apos;ve testified regarding mr. caffrey , is it ?
no .
six years ago , i testified against him .
yes . at the trail where he was convicted of forgery ?
yes .
and i went after him with everything i had .
i called him a liar and a thief
and probably a sociopath , and i meant every word of it .
so , what changed ?
neal did .
neal ? where are you ?
you know where i am .
you &apos;re at the roosevelt island tram .
you &apos;re at the edge of your radius .
kramer is going after the raphael .
you &apos;ll recall a night not long ago
when you said i had immunity ?
i remember , neal .
you &apos;ll recall that i said don &apos;t do anything stupid .
seven years ago , i did something stupid .
kramer &apos;s going after the old neal caffrey .
i need more than two miles today .
damn it , neal , you &apos;re playing right into kramer &apos;s hands .
you get caught ,
he &apos;s got you on possession of stolen goods .
with your prior , that &apos;s 25 years .
i can &apos;t undo what &apos;s already been done .
but i can get back what &apos;s not mine .
i got to go .
peter , please , extend my radius .
where are you going ?
to open a door i didn &apos;t want to have to open .
neal ? neal !
come on , peter .
electronic monitoring compliance unit .
this is burke , fbi .
come on .
thank you , buddy .
i don &apos;t recognize this number .
silent running , moz . kramer &apos;s after the raphael .
neal , where are you ?
on a tram headed for roosevelt island .
really ? roosevelt island ? why ?
i &apos;ll explain later .
right now i need you to find us transportation .
i may need your help getting back .
bye .
it &apos;s neal .
neal .
helen .
i haven &apos;t seen you since --
since the day i ran away .
this is nice .
still living by the river , i see .
it &apos;s become my home .
it &apos;s been a cold spring ,
but the hydrangea are coming back .
is it here ?
it is .
how much time do you have ?
maybe 10 minutes .
then let &apos;s make the most of it .
jones , can you pinpoint where caffrey is on roosevelt island
yeah . looks like he &apos;s at 4221 main street .
on my way .
you look good .
the same .
please .
it &apos;s been nearly a decade and a half .
yeah , it was my 18th birthday .
yeah , i kind of ruined that one for you .
it was a hell of a thing for a kid to hear .
i saved this for you .
you and your father .
my god .
you still have his eyes .
truth .
do you hate me for telling you what i did ?
no .
no , my mom told me he was dead .
said he died a hero , but you told me the truth .
he was a dirty cop ...
and he &apos;s not dead .
you were gonna go and join the force .
i told your mother ,
&quot; the moment he sets foot in the police academy ,
he &apos;s gonna get an earful . &quot;
truth .
was my father always corrupt ?
we met when we became partners as first @-@ year detectives .
he was the best ... then .
the evil came after .
but that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
no .
4221 main street .
it &apos;s a high @-@ rise .
yeah , i ran all the tenants .
the person in 14 @-@ e &apos;s been flagged .
flagged by whom ?
the marshals .
e. parker &apos;s in witness protection .
thanks , jones .
here it is . kept it safe . didn &apos;t open it .
it &apos;s postmarked the day before you were arrested .
yeah .
kate never came to get it ?
the pretty girl with the dark hair .
yeah .
she did . almost five years ago now .
but she didn &apos;t take it ?
she changed her mind .
said she wanted you to have it .
what about my mom ? did you ever --
no .
i haven &apos;t seen or heard from her -- or your father --
it &apos;s been years .
i have to admit i &apos;m curious .
what is in there that &apos;s so special ?
something i took trying to get back a life i lost ,
and it &apos;s been chasing me ever since .
better not let it catch you .
listen -- coming here , i &apos;m sorry .
the fbi is gonna show up . they &apos;ll ask questions .
this island was getting a little small for me anyway .
now , go .
thank you .
for everything .
do i want to know what &apos;s in there ?
plausible deniability .
come on , let &apos;s catch that tram .
my car &apos;s on the other side .
who is e. parker ?
i &apos;ve never told anyone this --
not even moz .
you gonna get that ?
peter , it &apos;s diana .
i &apos;m with kramer .
he knows caffrey &apos;s on roosevelt island .
where are you ?
we &apos;re at the tram terminal , manhattan side .
damn it .
what &apos;s going on ?
you &apos;re with caffrey .
yeah . and we &apos;re headed right to you .
let me first say
that agent burke and i have been married for 12 years .
it &apos;s a partnership that &apos;s built on respect , admiration , and trust .
and how is this relevant ?
peter &apos;s relationship with neal is based on the same elements
your husband trusts neal ?
he does . when it counts .
when it counts ?
well , neal was a con man .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;d want him dating your sister .
can i take that back ?
no .
listen -- peter and neal together ,
they argue and bicker .
but in the end -- when it counts --
peter puts up with neal because he &apos;s worth it .
should mr. caffrey &apos;s sentence be commuted ?
yes .
this is not good .
no , we ride this out ,
and you &apos;re put away for 20 years .
well , maybe there &apos;s another way .
what ?
no . forget that .
you &apos;ll never survive the fall .
i &apos;m not gonna to jump .
then what the hell are you planning ?
help me out and i &apos;ll tell you .
no , tell me , then i &apos;ll help you out .
you first .
fine .
thank you .
and ?
and i &apos;m doubling back toward roosevelt island .
wish me luck .
what ? no . neal , that &apos;s crazy .
damn it , get back in here !
neal !
you &apos;ll never make it !
neal !
neal !
what &apos;s up , moz ?
neal , you got a second ?
i do now .
it sounds windy where you are .
yeah . what is it ?
sara and i have a plan .
are you still on roosevelt island ?
i will be soon .
i &apos;ve carved out an escape route .
meet me at the traffic circle
where road 5 and east road connect .
i &apos;m on my way .
you gonna tell me what happened up there ?
i tracked neal to the island .
i was bringing him back --
then where is he ?
he &apos;d be here with me now
if you hadn &apos;t thrown a dozen guns at his face .
this is my fault ?
you box him in , he &apos;s gonna run .
you have no idea how to handle him . i do .
clearly .
tell me , pete .
neal have the painting on him ?
not that i saw .
are you handling him or becoming him ?
sir . the eastbound tram is approaching the island .
maintain pursuit on caffrey . i &apos;m heading downtown .
neal &apos;s got under an hour to meet sara ellis .
if he makes it , i &apos;ll be waiting for him .
coming in now .
mom , look at that .
neal ?
moz , start the engine !
caffery understands people .
you need space , he keeps to himself .
you need to talk , he listens .
you need a beer , he &apos;ll pour .
although he &apos;ll let you know he &apos;s slumming it .
do you support his commutation ?
he &apos;s damn good at what he does ,
and i consider him a friend .
but that doesn &apos;t change the fact
that he &apos;s a convicted bond forger and prison escapee .
i think he should finish out his two years with the bureau
and be grateful ...
that he &apos;s got the best damn deal i &apos;ve ever seen .
okay , sara &apos;s waiting for you at sterling bosch .
if you can make the hand @-@ off in time , you &apos;re golden .
&quot; if . &quot;
well , the odds of you making it are --
i know , moz .
but i don &apos;t have a choice .
yes . you do .
what &apos;s lolana doing here ?
well , during our brief alienation --
before the whole keller fiasco ...
i moved your portion of the treasure out of the country ,
should you ever care to claim it .
you saved my half ?
well , a little less than half .
i was angry -- sue me .
it &apos;s still worth more than either of us
could ever spend in a lifetime .
we could run . right now .
never look back .
i don &apos;t want to run anymore , moz .
all units , be on the lookout
for stolen ambulance number 313 .
that &apos;s us . so much for not running .
i have to finish this .
i somehow knew you were gonna say that .
but for lolana &apos;s sake , i had to give it a try .
go .
i &apos;ll lead the federal bloodhounds
on a chase of the wild @-@ goose variety .
thanks , moz .
here .
if i don &apos;t make it , you and lolana will need that
to get to the island without me .
you &apos;ll make it .
hey , sara .
where are you ?
a few blocks away .
listen -- meet me in the lobby . it &apos;s gonna be close .
neal , i --
neal .
sara , have you heard from neal ?
he &apos;s got the painting ,
but he &apos;s not gonna get past kramer .
he may not have to .
get us a meeting with your boss in the next five minutes .
i &apos;ll try .
don &apos;t try . do it .
i have eyes on caffrey .
not good .
heading east on pearl .
i &apos;m gonna regret this .
what ? ! hey ! hey ! you got to move that thing !
no can do , ma &apos;am .
what are you doing ? !
neal !
get in !
agent kramer , we lost caffrey .
all units fall back to sterling bosch .
form a perimeter around the building .
thank you .
good luck , caffrey .
your proposal ...
it all seems highly irregular .
yes , mr. bosch ,
but you can admit that irregularity
has worked very well for me in the past .
and i &apos;m offering you an opportunity
to make $ 15 million in five minutes .
agent burke , you can assure me this is all legal ?
i wouldn &apos;t be here if it weren &apos;t .
what do i have to do ?
just sign some start paperwork , sir .
i &apos;d say this moment was inevitable ,
wouldn &apos;t you , neal ?
i knew you could be reasonable .
i think you might take a real shine to d.c. after all .
don &apos;t count on it .
you do the honors , pete .
i should have listened to you . i played right into his hands
it &apos;s not over yet .
raphael &apos;s saint george and the dragon .
a seminal work .
excuse me .
that painting is property of sterling bosch insurance .
valiant effort , ms. ellis .
this is evidence in a criminal investigation .
investigation into what ?
class &quot; b &quot; possession of stolen property .
and you are ?
winston bosch . this young lady works for me .
i don &apos;t see anyone here with stolen property .
this painting --
belongs to sterling bosch .
we hired mr. caffrey to authenticate it for us .
the hell you did .
yes . i did . here .
mr. caffrey is quite the art expert .
he &apos;s even worked for the fbi as an authenticator .
i can attest to that .
and if he &apos;s good enough for you ,
he &apos;s good enough for me .
you &apos;re part of this ?
well , mr. caffrey ,
what &apos;s your professional assessment of this piece ?
that is definitely the real raphael .
i &apos;d stake my reputation on it .
excellent .
and for your services -- $ 1,200 .
sorry . neal &apos;s not allowed to accept payment
while he works for us .
even better .
see you around , caffrey .
see you around .
why don &apos;t you head home ?
get some rest . got a big day tomorrow .
you gonna be okay ?
i &apos;ll be fine . go .
you went behind my back ,
conspired to obstruct justice .
i could say you did the same .
wake up , petey ! open your eyes !
you &apos;re not his partner . you &apos;re his mark !
this boy &apos;s run such a good confidence game ,
he &apos;s got you thinking
that you &apos;ve come out ahead in all this .
when did you stop putting faith in people ?
when they stopped deserving it .
this isn &apos;t over yet , pete .
not by a long shot .
mr. caffrey , do you deserve to be free ?
that &apos;s not for me to decide .
i won &apos;t sit here and give you some monologue
about how reformed i am .
actions speak louder than words ,
and , hopefully , my actions while in service to the fbi
say more than i can .
and what would you do with your freedom ?
i can tell you one thing .
i won &apos;t be going anywhere anytime soon .
you won &apos;t ?
no .
i &apos;m happy here .
you know , someone once told me
my life is a dream with an anklet attached .
if i wake up tomorrow and that anklet is still on --
i have a good job , a wonderful home ...
a partner and a best friend .
a family .
but to wake up and answer only to myself ...
that would mean everything .
we have one more interview to conduct
before we make our decision .
you &apos;ll have an answer here today by 5 : 00 p.m.
thank you .
how &apos;d it go ?
as well as it could go , i think .
you know what the nice thing is ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
what do you mean ?
you &apos;re gonna go in there and say your piece ,
and the board &apos;s gonna make their decision .
but with or without my anklet ,
come monday morning , i &apos;m gonna step off that elevator
on the 21st floor and go to work .
you once told me you never lied to me
and you never will .
so i need to know something .
the first time kramer and i went after you for the degas ,
how &apos;d you switch the paintings ?
i snuck up to the penthouse , pulled the swap ,
then base @-@ jumped off the building and landed on wall street .
fine . don &apos;t tell me .
i got to go in .
that person you saw on roosevelt island --
who was it ?
when this is over ...
i &apos;ll tell you everything .
see you soon .
they &apos;re ready for you now , agent burke .
thanks , henry .
what is this ?
these marshals are here to take neal caffrey
into custody when he returns .
for what ?
if you had only listened to me .
for what ?
public endangerment .
i &apos;ve got a dozen eyewitnesses
who saw caffrey hop that tram .
combine that with evading arrest , obstruction of justice .
hell , i may even throw in a jaywalking charge for good measure
we &apos;re not in the revenge business .
neal pissed you off , and now you want to hurt him .
just control him .
neal &apos;s got a lot of skeletons .
i &apos;ll pick one , slap that anklet on him ,
and he &apos;ll work for me in d.c. permanently .
you understand this is best for everyone , don &apos;t you ?
don &apos;t you ?
i have a statement to make .
state your name and relationship to neal caffrey
for the record , please .
special agent peter burke .
i &apos;ve been neal caffrey &apos;s handler at the federal
bureau of investigation since his release into our custody
you caught him ?
twice .
and you should know , the last time i caught him ,
he was sitting alone in an empty apartment .
he had nothing . no one .
and now ?
he has a life . a real life here .
one that keeps him grounded and decent .
as you &apos;ve heard ,
there are many people who care about neal ,
people who see him as more than just a criminal .
he &apos;s frustrating , i &apos;ll admit .
he drives me crazy on his best days .
i don &apos;t always have to know where neal is
or what he &apos;s up to .
but i do know that he has a good heart
and a set of principles ...
that weren &apos;t there six years ago when
he was just another case file that got dropped on my desk .
do you think mr. caffrey is reformed ?
as long as he &apos;s on that anklet , we &apos;ll never know .
we can sit here until kingdom come
and debate over who is neal caffrey .
but as long as we keep him tethered ,
as long as we treat him like a criminal ,
he &apos;ll always think that he is one .
whether neal is a citizen , a c.i. , or a thief
is a decision that needs to be put in his hands .
agent burke ...
hello ?
should neal caffrey &apos;s sentence be commuted ?
yes .
i &apos;m saying neal should be free .
i &apos;m sorry -- this couldn &apos;t wait .
peter caffrey &apos;s cut his anklet .
