all right , raj has played his phantom warlord card ,
and i am going to back him up with my strangling vines .
choke on that , sucka .
okay , well , then i &apos;ll just cut your vines with my ruby sword .
that &apos;s right , i did it . i cut &apos; em .
i have a question .
warlord beats troll , troll beats elf ,
elf beats water sprite ,
and basically everything beats enchanted bunny .
unless you have the carrot powder .
okay , i &apos;ve got another question .
when does this get fun ?
are we going to talk
or are we going to play &quot; mystic warriors of ka @-@ ah &quot; ?
just play a potion card .
which one ?
it doesn &apos;t matter .
you can &apos;t possibly win .
sheldon , don &apos;t ruin the game .
how could he ruin the game ?
given the cards that have already been played ,
penny can only be holding necromancer potions ,
which are only effective against wraiths and day @-@ walkers ,
and there are no more of either left to be drawn .
the cards remaining in the undrawn stack are :
four fire weapons , a troll , two ogres and the jewel of osiris .
see ? ruined .
sheldon , that is incredible .
from your vantage point , it certainly must seem so .
sheldon has kind of a photographic memory .
&quot; photographic &quot; is a misnomer .
i have an eidetic memory , as i &apos;ve told you many times .
most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of may seventh .
you had turkey and complained it was dry .
well , i guess game &apos;over .
really ? oh , great .
i mean , aw .
okay , i gotta go .
why ?
because the last me i didn &apos;t go ,
i ended up playing &quot; mystic warlords of ka . &quot;
not &quot; ka . ka @-@ ah . &quot;
buh @-@ eye .
see ya .
still can &apos;t believe she &apos;s going out with me .
nobody can .
that reminds me i have a bone to pick with you .
what ?
you and i made a pact
that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend ,
that person would have his girlfriend
hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends .
i don &apos;t remember that .
june 30th , 2004 .
opening day of spider @-@ man 2 at the amc pasadena .
they only had red icees , no blue .
oh , yeah .
so you &apos;ve been with penny for like a month and a half now .
where &apos;s my shorty , morty ?
howard , you can &apos;t hold me to that .
why not ?
because when i made that agreement ,
i didn &apos;t think i &apos;d ever have a hot girlfriend .
and i was positive you ever would .
hey , how come i wasn &apos;t part of this deal ?
you had left the refreshment stand
in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre @-@ show urination .
oh , so that &apos;s how it works ?
i have a teeny bladder and i don &apos;t get a hot girlfriend ?
yeah , raj . that &apos;s how it works .
damn .
can i have a napkin ?
i &apos;m sorry , no .
but you have whole bunch of &apos; em .
yes , i &apos;ve moved to a four @-@ napkin system .
lap , hands , face and personal emergency .
if you like , starting tomorrow ,
i &apos;ll add a guest napkin ,
but i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing i can do for you today .
good luck . that &apos;s the face napkin .
so , have you talked to penny yet ?
no , i haven &apos;t .
why not ?
because i &apos;ve been busy ,
because i haven &apos;t figured out a way to bring it up ,
and mostly-- and i can &apos;t stress how key this is--
because i don &apos;t want to .
leonard , pact is a pact .
you have to get penny to fix me up .
it &apos;s not that simple .
what am i supposed to say ?
&quot; penny , do you have any friend
you &apos;d like to never hear from again ? &quot;
come on , i &apos;m smart ,
i have good job and i have only three percent body fat .
it &apos;s true .
i &apos;ve seen him at the beach .
he &apos;s like a human chicken wing .
leonard , come on .
fine . i &apos;ll ask if she has a friend for you .
hot friend .
right .
and tall .
i want our kids to be able to ride space mountain
before they &apos;re 20 .
i &apos;ll see what i can do .
hey , sheldon , guess what i heard today ?
i &apos;d imagine you heard many number of things today .
when you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard , &quot; hello , raj .
&quot; how are you , raj ? &quot;
given that you &apos;re wearing a new sweater @-@ vest ,
and possibly , though far less likely , &quot; nice sweater @-@ vest . &quot;
why don &apos;t i just tell you what i heard today .
that would probably save us some time .
saturday night at the comic book store ,
they &apos;re having a &quot; mystic warlords of ka @-@ ah &quot; tournament .
first prize is $ 500 .
if we team up , we &apos;d be unstoppable .
i &apos;m sorry , raj , but i have no interest
in playing a game in which i find no challenge .
what about the money ?
i have money .
this is other money .
how does it differ from the money i have ?
half of it will be mine .
do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater @-@ vest ?
leonard , help .
are you kidding ?
i couldn &apos;t even talk him into giving one of his freakin &apos; napkins .
wow , you really are a genius .
not really .
i googled how to do that .
so , listen ... have you ever made a pact with someone ?
you mean like a pinky swear ?
okay , fine , like a pinky swear .
well , in the first grade , my friend rosie and i
made a pact to marry bert and ernie .
you know , from sesame street ?
i &apos;m familiar with bert and ernie .
then we find out we both wanted ernie .
we didn &apos;t speak again until middle school .
over puppets ?
the heart wants what the heart wants , leonard .
okay .
speaking of what the heart want-
um , a long time ago ,
i made a pact with wolowitz that kind of involves you .
okay , i don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going with this ,
but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have .
no , no , nothing like that .
the deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend ,
we &apos;d have her fix the other one up with one of her friends .
and you thought it &apos;s a good time to bring this up right after sex ?
well , i sure as hell wasn &apos;t going to bring it up before sex .
and during , i was trying to remember what i read on google , so ...
i &apos;m not hooking wolowitz up with one of my friends .
it doesn &apos;t have to be a good friend .
and you know that deep down inside , howard &apos;s a really nice guy .
the problem isn &apos;t what &apos;s on the inside .
it &apos;s the creepy candy coating .
will you at least think about it ?
just as a favor to me ?
oh , great thing about ernie , was he never asked me for anything .
he just gave .
got it . got it . got it . got it . got it . got it .
betty and veronica ?
hey , sheldon , the new greelantern figurine &apos;s coming in tomorrow .
want me to set one aside for you ?
thank you .
you just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine
and make the oh @-@ so @-@ satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession .
all right , i won &apos;t set one aside for you .
but i must have it .
okay , i &apos;ll set one aside for you .
thank you .
you know , i can buy all these things online .
i come here for the personal service .
hey , stuart , is the wil wheaton signed up
for the mystic warlords tournament
the wil wheaton from star trek ?
yeah , he lives around here . big gamer .
excuse me .
are you saying that wil wheaton aka ensign wesley crusher
on star trek : the next generation
is going to be participating in your tournament ?
oh , i &apos;m sorry ,
did i rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself ?
you don &apos;t understand .
growing up , i idolizedle wil wheaton .
wesley crusher had an eidetic memory just like me .
ooh , what a coincidence .
maybe you can discuss with him while you &apos;re playing in the tournament .
sign here .
i was such a fan
that in 1995 , i traveled ten hours by bus
to a sci @-@ fi convention in jackson , mississippi ,
wearing my starfleet academy cadet uniform
in order to meet wil wheaton
and get him to autograph
my mint in @-@ package wesley crusher action figure
ooh , it &apos;ll be like a reunion then .
sign here .
my arduous journey , however , was for naught .
although advertised to appear , he did not show up .
it was at that moment , i vowed eternal hatred for wil wheaton .
okay , great , you can tell him you hate him .
sign here .
it might also interest you to know that wil wheaton
currently ranks sixth on my all @-@ time enemies list--
right between director joel schumacher ,
who nearly destroyed the batman movie franchise ,
and billy sparks ,
who lived down the street from me
and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle .
okay , i get it . he &apos;s a bad guy .
sign here .
in the words of khan noonien singh
in the immortal wrath of khan , &quot; he tasks me . &quot;
he tasks me and i shall have him . &quot;
no doubt , sign here .
from hell &apos;s heart , i stab at thee . &quot;
all right , raj , looks like you &apos;re teamed up
with &quot; die , wil wheaton , die . &quot;
so , tell me more about the future mother of my children .
she &apos;s adorable , howard .
i think you &apos;ll like her .
great .
so what did you tell her about me ?
did you mention the body fat ?
no , i thought that would be a nice surprise for her .
good , good .
i just told her y &apos;re an aerospace engineer ,
you speak five languages--
six if you count klingon .
girls don &apos;t count klingon , howard .
right ?
right .
oh . and i told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother .
what ?
i &apos;m kidding .
another delightful surprise for her .
sheldon , it &apos;s your play .
sheldon .
my enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy
with a cursed mace . game
sorry , boys .
say hi to your mother when she picks you up .
or i could just tell her later tonight !
we pwned them , dude ! up top !
look at him .
wil wheaton , my old friend .
i have chased you &apos; round the moons of nibia
and &apos; round the antares maelstrom and &apos; round perdition &apos;s ames !
you know , you keep quoting wrath of khan ,
but he was in next generation .
it &apos;s a totally different set of characters .
silence !
how much longer must i wait for my revenge ?
well , if wil wheaton and stuart win their match
and we beat lonely larry and captain sweatpants
in the next round ,
we &apos;ll face off for the championship .
so , my path to satisfaction is blocked
by lonely larry and captain sweatpants .
very well .
they must be destroyed .
dude , you have to stop talking like that .
it &apos;s really lame .
silence !
so , penny tells me you &apos;re working as a waitress
to put yourself through grade school .
that &apos;s pretty great . what are you studying ?
microbiology .
oh , cool . so you could study me .
i don &apos;understand .
microbiology is the study of tiny living things .
i know , i &apos;m studying it .
and i said you could study me &apos; cause i &apos;m a tiny living thing .
it &apos;s a joke .
are you sure ?
do you like sic @-@ fiction ?
no .
role @-@ playing games ?
like in the bedroom or like dungeons and dragons ?
either .
no .
gonna be a long night .
well , it &apos;s your fault .
i had to ask . you didn &apos;t have to say yes .
you like magic ?
not really .
okay .
long @-@ long night .
i play my endless serpent . raj will play ecstatic frenzy ,
whh means larry will have to play chaos overlord .
( 看这个男人胸前的星星就是在cos美国队长 )
i play nightshade dryad . game , set and match .
now fetch me wil wheaton !
bot @-@ tash bir jab @-@ loo @-@ di rekh kkhakkh @-@ o ny !
did that guy just say
&quot; revenge is a dish best served cold &quot; in klingon ?
i believe so .
what is wrong with him ?
everyone has a different theory .
how about computers ?
do you like computers ?
i use them . i don &apos;t like them .
okay ...
puppets ? where do you stand on puppies ? .
a puppy once bit my face .
of course it did .
how about that ? einstein was wrong .
what ?
approaching the speed of light
doesn &apos;t slow down time .
approaching them does .
excuse me .
oh , damn . it &apos;s my mother .
are you going to answer it ?
i &apos;m torn
she might be dying , and , you know ,
i wouldn &apos;t want to miss that .
on the other hand ,
if i let it go to voicemail , i could play it over and over .
i know how you feel . my mother makes me crazy .
not as crazy as my mother makes me .
oh , yeah ?
does your mother call u every day at work
to see if you &apos;ve had a healthy lunch ?
my mother calls me at workk
to see if i had a healthy bowel movement .
does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning
like you &apos;re nine years old ?
you live with your mother ?
no . that &apos;s the sad part .
ooh , rough .
okay , check this out .
my mother made me we rubber gloves to kindergarten
so i wouldn &apos;t pick up a disease from the other children .
that &apos;s nothing .
i couldn &apos;t ride a bicle
&apos;cause my mother was afraid i &apos;d hit a bump and lose my virginity .
you didn &apos;t , did you ?
not on a bicle .
in a camry .
corolla !
more wine ?
i &apos;d love some .
listen , you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime .
why ?
a catholic girl like you , wearing a big cross like that
might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm
i &apos;ve been hoping for .
okay , but only if you come
to sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke .
it &apos;s a date .
am i a matchmaker or what ?
lava serpent .
nest of snakes .
underworld guardian .
underworld guardian .
we skirmish to the death .
invisibility spell .
luminescence spell .
water nymph .
fire demon .
two @-@ headed tiger .
three @-@ headed lion .
sulphur .
brimstone .
problem , wil wheaton ?
hang on .
you &apos;re holding two moderate spell cards ,
a small rock and a potion of zancor
which will be about as much help
as an air conditioner on the ice planet hoth .
your only move is to play the potion ,
lose the skirmish ,
and two moves later , the game .
i think he &apos;s got me .
the year was 1995 .
the place : jackson , mississippi .
having spent ten hours on a bus ,
during which i had to twice violate my personal rule
against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle ...
i finally arrived
at the fourth annual dixie @-@ trek convention
only to find that my idol wil wheaton decided he had
better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure .
what ?
you betrayed me , wil wheaton .
now i have my revenge .
you went to the &apos; 95 dixie @-@ trek ?
oh , dude , my grandmother had just died ,
and i had to go to her funeral .
your mee @-@ maw died ?
that &apos;s terrible .
yeah , it was .
but i &apos;m really sorry that i disappointed you .
no , no , i understand .
anything happened to my mee @-@ maw ,
i &apos;d be one inconsolable moon pie .
i should clarify that statement
by explaining that she calls me &quot; moon pie . &quot;
it &apos;a special relationship , isn &apos;t it ,
between a boy and his grandmother ?
oh , yes .
okay , great , everybody loves their grandmas !
now , come on , sheldon , finish him off !
it &apos;s okay , sheldon .
i let you down .
i deserve it .
potion of zancor .
what are you waiting for ? !
kill wil wheaton !
from hell &apos;s heart , stab at him !
i can &apos;t .
sure you can . do it ! do it !
no .
i came here to defeat wil wheaton ,
the man who destroyed my dreams .
but i can &apos;t defeat wil wheaton , the man who loved his mee @-@ maw .
enchanted bunny .
no ! not enchanted bunny !
i call my mee @-@ maw &quot; nana . &quot;
and she &apos;s going be very happy
to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny .
game over , moon pie .
i @-@ i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
your grandmother &apos;s alive ?
oh , you catch on quick .
come on , stewie , let &apos;s get our prize money .
