neal .
ellen .
you and your father .
but you told me the truth .
he was a dirty cop ... and he &apos;s not dead .
you grew up in witness protection .
i was 3 when the marshals took us away .
ellen agreed to help me look into my father
before she disappears into witsec again .
we found a gun with your dad &apos;s prints on it .
he killed a cop ?
he confessed .
ellen !
they found me .
who ?
trust sam .
i was undercover with the flynn organization .
they were a local crime family
with some p.d. on the payroll .
including my father ?
dennis fynn sr. died in prison . this is his son .
maybe he &apos;s here for revenge .
sam &apos;s blood .
run his dna .
peter , he &apos;s here .
something you have to know , neal .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
tell you what ?
that you &apos;re my father .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
why did you lie to me ?
i had a feeling that after everything you &apos;d heard about me ,
i &apos;d be the last person
you &apos;d want to see walking through your door .
well , that &apos;s a big assumption to make .
did you kill a cop ?
i &apos;m a lot of things , neal , but , uh ...
not that .
no . not that .
all right .
you tell me what did happen .
that was your third birthday .
you remember ?
no , i don &apos;t .
it was the hottest march in years .
ellen and i had just gotten off duty .
dad !
neal !
you didn &apos;t think i was gonna miss the cake , did you ?
i had made detective three months earlier .
next thing you know , the two of you will be on patrol together .
i didn &apos;t wear the hat anymore , but you always loved it .
things were good then .
what changed ?
i was young , driven ,
confident i could take on anybody .
all right , police ! hands in the air !
she said hands in the air !
drop it !
ellen would have said i was arrogant .
she probably would have been right .
well , that &apos;s great ,
but i want to know what happened to our family .
i &apos;m telling you .
i was a good cop .
son of a bitch !
ellen and i were on a tear .
all the bad guys were afraid of us .
you have to understand something , neal .
i loved you and your mother very much , but we weren &apos;t rich .
it &apos;s not easy raising a family on a cop &apos;s salary .
we hit these gun runners ,
taking down their major suppliers .
let &apos;s go .
one operation , i find myself alone ,
staring at a crate full of cash .
one bundle was three months &apos; salary .
what did you do ?
i &apos;ve thought a lot about that moment .
i could have gone either way .
flip a coin .
heads , i take it . tails , i don &apos;t .
and you took it .
yeah . i took it .
hey , bennett .
that &apos;s when everything changed .
we got to talk .
your supervising officer sees you taking money from a crime scene ,
that should be the last thing you ever do as a cop .
but he said he &apos;d look the other way
if i did a couple favors for him .
and if not , you went to jail .
that &apos;s how i ended up working for the flynns .
let &apos;s go , guys ! let &apos;s go ! it &apos;s a raid !
they started me off small .
let &apos;s go !
making sure their guys got out the door before a bust , that sort of thing .
police ! hands in the air !
ellen had no idea .
police !
i was her partner , her best friend .
where the hell is everybody ?
i was in her blind spot .
pretty soon , opening doors for the irish mob wasn &apos;t enough .
i was also taking down a lot of the flynns &apos; competition .
that &apos;s when things got bad .
neal , are you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine .
you &apos;re james bennett .
i understand you have every reason not to trust me right now , burke .
you told us you were sam phelps .
no , you assumed i was sam phelps .
i didn &apos;t correct you .
did ellen know that she was in contact with you and not sam ?
no .
so you lied to ellen , too ?
when i went into witsec ,
they sent me to montana -- alone .
after about 10 years , i was going nuts .
i @-@ i couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
they wouldn &apos;t tell me where you were ,
so i went back to d.c.
the only one who would talk to me was sam .
he told me how he and ellen had gotten very close
to making a case against the people who framed me ,
but the only connection he had left with ellen
was a p.o. box --
a way of getting in touch in case of an emergency .
and sam gave you the p.o. box .
he was about to retire .
if ellen reached out ,
he wanted somebody to be able to help her .
then one day ...
... this showed up .
that &apos;s ellen &apos;s e @-@ mail .
i was gonna tell her the truth when i got to new york ,
but i didn &apos;t get the chance .
listen , i &apos;ve been here over a month , and i got nothing .
i don &apos;t even know who attacked me .
dennis flynn .
that &apos;s impossible . he died in prison .
this is flynn jr . ,
the son who &apos;s trying to revive the family business .
we think he killed ellen .
we plan to bring them down -- for good this time .
let me help you .
how bad are you injured ?
ah , it &apos;s just a bruised rib .
it &apos;s nothing i haven &apos;t slept off before .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
have fun in school .
okay .
bye @-@ bye .
you okay ?
no . i &apos;m not .
do you believe him ?
right now , i want to focus on taking flynn down .
this is dennis flynn jr .
years ago , the flynn crime family was dismantled .
he &apos;s spent the last 10 years trying to rebuild it .
according to organized crime ,
flynn did so by moving into the white @-@ collar world .
his latest venture is personal .
the flynns started making money by bootlegging whiskey .
after prohibition ended , they moved into counterfeiting
and used the conroy family for distribution
until they had a falling out .
i have google , too .
flynn doesn &apos;t normally get his hands dirty .
but because of the family history ,
he &apos;s handling this himself .
it &apos;s a decent fake .
the relief on the lettering is a little shallow ,
but if you &apos;ve never held a bottle before , you wouldn &apos;t know that .
true test , however , is in the palate .
if you &apos;re pouring , i &apos;ll take a dram .
for flynn , this venture symbolizes everything
that once was great about the family .
it &apos;s not about profit . it &apos;s about pride .
even so , there &apos;s always money in good fake booze .
which this is not .
it &apos;s bottom shelf mixed with caramel coloring .
counterfeiting is all about creating the closest simulation
to the real thing at a fraction of the cost .
flynn needs better taste for a low price .
i can make a better product for him , gain his trust .
of course your resume includes whiskey counterfeiting .
well , basic alcohol counterfeiting .
once you know the fundamentals , you can --
good , we can get him on distribution of counterfeit items .
what are you talking about ?
thanks , guys .
we arrest flynn for distribution ? that &apos;s it ?
we don &apos;t have enough evidence for murder ... yet .
but if we can prove distribution ,
he &apos;ll be locked up , and we &apos;ll be able to collect evidence .
you &apos;re the boss .
i want you to teach jones
everything you know about whiskey counterfeiting .
you can &apos;t bench me on this .
yeah . i can .
it would take me a month to teach jones everything i know ,
and you need me to make a good counterfeit .
are you ransoming your skills ?
look , if it were easy to do ,
flynn wouldn &apos;t have such a hard time finding a good one .
you &apos;re too close to this .
you really think you can keep a smile on your face
when you &apos;re standing in front of that guy
after what he &apos;s done ?
yeah , i do ... because i have to .
what are your thoughts on approaching him ?
i must have lost my mind .
i went to new jersey of my own free will .
if you want to get flavor extracts
or find a discount tanning salon , there &apos;s no better place .
six different factories conveniently lined up
for clandestine tasting .
just this one vial could make the entire hudson river
taste like ... oh , bacon .
add that to your to @-@ do list .
so , have you decided what brand we &apos;re gonna forge ?
shackleton whiskey .
ah , the shackleton -- dug out of the antarctic ice
after ernest shackleton &apos;s ill @-@ fated journey
came to an abrupt end .
probably because he brought more whiskey than supplies .
they say you can taste the frozen tundra in every bottle .
what do you think that tastes like , moz ?
penguin feathers .
i have no idea . my only bottle of shackleton ...
was lost in a bet to me .
yeah , only because you cheated .
illegal usage of gum drop lane .
you lost a $ 200,000 bottle of whiskey playing &quot; candy land &quot; ?
high @-@ stakes candy land .
darling , the next time ,
would you please read the rules more carefully ?
thank you .
we have a deal ?
oh , we &apos;ll make you a couple bottles , i promise .
thank you so much .
hey , are you going into the counterfeit @-@ booze business ?
no , no . i &apos;m getting a head start here on my christmas shopping .
remind me to check the bottle of barolo she got me last year .
yeah .
look at that .
mmm , quite the bouquet of fruit .
hmm , i taste , uh , apples and peaches .
plus toffee and caramel , with a hint of cinnamon .
no penguin feathers .
it &apos;s a complex mix . this isn &apos;t gonna be easy .
all right , i finished charring the oak .
okay , that should add some body to this cheap whiskey .
ooh , we got a lot of work to do .
we have a lot of work to drink .
if we &apos;re gonna match that flavor ,
we &apos;re gonna have to taste the wares --
repeatedly .
in light of recent events , that will not be a problem .
you know , whiskey comes from a gaelic word mean--
what ?
you said &quot; gaelic . &quot;
a gaelic word meaning &quot; water of life . &quot;
now i understand that .
yeah , and tomorrow morning ,
we are gonna find that name painfully ironic .
mmm , a touch more ceylon cinnamon .
i think .
oh , come on . it &apos;s perfect .
you just want me to keep drinking
so that i &apos;ll talk about my father .
i admit nothing ... unless it &apos;s working .
i don &apos;t know whether to be mad or impressed
that my own dad conned me .
well , at least you learned where you inherited
that particular skill from .
i keep thinking i should have known it was him .
that even after all these years ,
a man should know his own father when he &apos;s right in front of him .
and here he is ,
yet you seem hesitant to seize that opportunity .
to do what , moz ?
go out in the backyard and throw a baseball ?
he doesn &apos;t get to come back here and make up for lost time .
this is ready .
okay .
so , we just add the coloring to our faux shackleton , and--
we &apos;re not gonna add the coloring .
then it will obviously be a fake .
which is part of your plan .
did you tell me that already ?
on the seventh tasting .
look , flynn is looking for a counterfeiter , right ?
so we have to prove to him
that we can make something that &apos;s close to the real thing .
without making it appear
that you just used the real thing .
ding , ding , ding , ding , ding .
ah , so , once you convince him of your skill ,
then what &apos;s the plan ?
peter wants to take flynn down for counterfeiting .
for counterfeiting , moz .
ellen deserves more than her killer getting a slap on the wrist .
so one way or another ...
i &apos;m gonna make sure he goes down for murder .
neal caffrey hung over-- didn &apos;t think it was possible .
taste testing is a necessary part of counterfeiting whiskey .
seriously ?
you sacrificed for the greater good .
here &apos;s your reward .
what is that ?
pickle juice .
i &apos;m not drinking that .
well , you should .
it &apos;s an old burke family hangover cure .
it was either that or raw eggs and butter .
now you &apos;re making stuff up .
is your batch ready ?
it is . i tested it this morning .
ah , hair of the dog-- also a good cure .
i don &apos;t know about the cure part .
how &apos;d your end go ?
this afternoon , flynn will be at a micro @-@ distillery tasting
for event planners and liquor distributors .
how &apos;d you find out-- organized crime tip ?
organized wife tip .
she has access to the guest lists for these types of things .
she &apos;s not gonna be there , is she ?
yeah , she will . she &apos;ll be fine .
flynn is a very successful businessman .
he wouldn &apos;t do anything at this event
to tarnish that reputation .
can she get me a booth ?
already did .
so , drink your pickle juice . i need you on your &quot; a &quot; game .
that &apos;s it .
and then when we &apos;re done ,
we &apos;ll , uh , need to finish our conversation with james .
would you mind handling that without me ?
neal , he &apos;s your father . you have to talk to him .
he &apos;s a man we need information from .
and i know you &apos;ll ask all the right questions .
stop staring . you &apos;re hurting my head .
if that &apos;s what you really want .
it is .
all right , i will .
thanks .
you know , it &apos;s tough enough to read you
even without the sunglasses .
hmm , maybe i &apos;ll keep them .
how you doing today ?
thank you .
let me get set up here .
excellent .
excuse me .
mr. earnhart , glad you could make it .
thank you .
you know i never pass up an opportunity
to get paid to drink good whiskey .
well , i think you &apos;re in luck .
we have a lot of amazing micro @-@ distillers here today .
enjoy .
thank you .
you ready for a tasting ?
nice .
it looks like the pickle juice worked .
always does .
the hangover &apos;s gone , but what about when neal sees flynn ?
jones is there to step in neal &apos;s way if he needs help .
plus , elizabeth is armed with a very disapproving look .
i &apos;ve got eyes on flynn .
great .
once he &apos;s near neal &apos;s booth , you guys are up .
all right .
let &apos;s see how well you know your whiskey , shall we ?
in one of these , i have poured shackleton whiskey ,
and in the other my own private micro @-@ distillery .
let &apos;s see if you can tell the difference .
you think you can replicate shackleton ?
no , i did replicate it .
you familiar with shackleton , sir ?
i consult for mackenzie distillers .
ah , who made the shackleton replica a couple years ago .
it wasn &apos;t bad .
no , it was perfection .
no , this is .
but don &apos;t take my word for it . you tell me .
i &apos;d like to try the other one .
be my guest .
mmm , elegant , light ,
with a taste of orkney islands peat .
this is definitely the shackleton .
no .
no , this is the shackleton .
it &apos;s the kind of whiskey a man would freeze to death for .
well , there &apos;s only one way to solve this .
let &apos;s find out who &apos;s right .
now , we all know shackleton is renowned
for its light amber color , so ...
after you .
elegant and light .
gentlemen , i work at a micro @-@ distillery .
you really think i can afford shackleton ?
i &apos;m impressed .
we &apos;ll be in touch .
all right .
how did you distill it ?
must have cost you a few bucks .
oh , if i answer that question , you wouldn &apos;t need me , would you ?
i get it .
thank you for the dram .
he didn &apos;t take the bait .
seems caffrey was too legitimate .
i think i can fix this .
you shouldn &apos;t be here . excuse me .
i &apos;m sorry ?
this is not a real distillery license number .
you forged the document .
listen , i @-@ i think there &apos;s been a misunderstanding , okay ?
i filed the paperwork already .
i should have it in a couple months .
well , until then , this is illegal .
please , don &apos;t call the cops , okay ?
i won &apos;t . but you should get out of here before someone else does .
all right .
got to say , i &apos;m surprised
a guy with your skills would need to fake a license .
yeah , well ...
give me one of your business cards .
i &apos;ll be in touch .
i love it . my wife saved a sting .
i didn &apos;t save it . i just gave it an extra push ,
which saved it .
are you still meeting with neal &apos;s father tonight ?
i am . i wish neal would change his mind .
whatever my opinions of the man , james is his father .
neal should hear everything from him .
can &apos;t imagine what neal &apos;s been going through .
this is his chance to break the cycle .
if what james says is true .
about being framed ?
mm @-@ hmm .
do you believe him ?
i &apos;m willing to hear him out , and i think neal should , too .
well , ask neal again .
but this time ,
tell him we &apos;ll do it at our house over dinner .
a home @-@ cooked meal with a con man
and his long @-@ lost , dirty @-@ cop father ?
yeah , exactly .
maybe what this needs is a little normality .
good idea . i &apos;ll call him .
look , peter , i told you -- i don &apos;t want to be there , all right ?
yeah , i &apos;ll think about it .
tell elizabeth thank you .
i have discovered a new hobby .
drinking is the opposite of a new hobby for you .
hmm , i &apos;m thinking about counterfeit tequila next time .
you should stock up on limes .
i &apos;ll get right on that .
so , what did the suit want ?
he invited me to dinner .
how dare he .
he also invited james .
what ?
you should go .
et tu , moz ?
have you ever stopped to think about why he conned you ?
yeah , to find out what i knew about the evidence box .
or maybe to get to know you .
you don &apos;t know that .
would you have spoken to him if you &apos;d known who he was ?
i wasn &apos;t given the opportunity .
he conned his son into bonding with him .
it &apos;s hardly a hallmark moment .
i didn &apos;t say it was noble ,
but it was human and dare i say ...
something you might have done .
look , every orphan wants to know their parents .
i know i &apos;d give anything to know mine .
you can , neal , right now .
don &apos;t throw away that chance .
well , i , uh -- i appreciate the thought , peter .
but i don &apos;t think he &apos;s coming .
well , he &apos;s always late .
no , he &apos;s not .
that much i &apos;ve learned about him ,
so it &apos;ll have to do for now .
you know , i @-@ i &apos;m very grateful
for you guys being a family to him .
it &apos;s nice to know he &apos;s got people like you two in his life .
mm , i &apos;ll get that .
is this real or fake ?
oh , that &apos;s real .
i &apos;ve had my fill of counterfeit things lately .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
thanks .
hon , what &apos;s so funny ?
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s just , um , the two of you
are sneaking pot roast to the dog in the same way .
you &apos;re putting it into your napkin
and then palming it to the dog -- it &apos;s very funny .
i &apos;m sorry .
sorry , liz . satchmo looked hungry , so i just ...
no , um , peter cooked the pot roast .
ah .
i mean , it &apos;s a little -- it &apos;s a little dry .
uh , yeah , it is .
i was hoping satchmo would take some of mine , as well .
perfect segue into dessert , yes ?
yes , yes . yeah .
uh , i &apos;m actually gonna go walk satchmo , as well .
all right .
thank you very much .
mm @-@ hmm .
get that out of your way .
thanks .
satch , come on .
i hear you &apos;re going undercover with the flynns .
i am .
you have no idea how dangerous those guys are .
i &apos;ve dealt with worse people .
i don &apos;t think you have .
then maybe now is a good time for you to finish your story .
when did you first encounter the flynns ?
when i tried to get out .
i couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
i got tired of lying to your mother and to ellen .
i was dreading the day
that you &apos;d find out that your father was a crook .
i &apos;m out .
you don &apos;t get to make the terms of this , james .
i don &apos;t care . it &apos;s too much .
i &apos;ll tell you what .
but flynn sr. knew i was valuable .
he threatened me , showed me a gun he &apos;d used to kill a cop .
he kept the murder weapon on him ?
in an old whiskey box .
it was his way of showing that he was untouchable .
but i was adamant , and , uh , eventually ,
he relented and said that he &apos;d let me out
if i did one last job .
what was it ?
he told me that my supervising officer would have it .
but when i got there , i thought they were gonna kill me .
everyone not in the family
is disposable to them , after all ,
including my supervising officer .
they &apos;d killed him with my spare firearm .
they &apos;d stolen it out of my locker .
james ?
see , they timed their frame perfectly .
drop the gun .
even ellen didn &apos;t believe me at first .
but you convinced her .
the truth convinced her , and i &apos;m hoping
that once i have this box with the evidence she found ,
it will convince you , too .
can you show me one piece of that evidence now ?
ellen believed me .
well , she &apos;s dead , so i &apos;m gonna need a little more than that .
neal .
no , he already conned me once .
and i know better than anyone , the stories are meaningless
unless you got something to back it up .
excuse me .
yeah . all right .
i &apos;ll be there tomorrow .
thanks for dinner , peter . i got to go .
what ? where ?
to prepare . dennis flynn &apos;s got a job for me .
looks like i &apos;m back in the family business .
have you heard of the flynn family ?
can &apos;t say that i have .
see , that &apos;s a problem .
back in the old days , everybody knew our name
and what it meant .
what did it mean ?
whiskey .
it was prohibition .
we were the biggest game in town .
what happened after prohibition ended ?
ah , we moved on to other things , built an empire .
and then the feds tore everything down .
trumped @-@ up charges , of course .
of course .
i &apos;ve been rebuilding it ever since .
my old man would have been proud .
what did your father do ?
he was a cop .
you didn &apos;t follow in his footsteps .
no .
i thought about it , but ... wasn &apos;t for me .
well , fathers can be a tough thing to live up to .
probably best that you went your own way .
you &apos;re telling me .
is that an f @-@ 520 column still ?
yes , sir .
can &apos;t wait to play with that .
you know , actually , i &apos;m a little more interested
in your , uh -- your knack for imitations .
how soon can you start ?
oh , i can get the bottles of shackleton going right away .
how are you gonna sell them ?
don &apos;t be too eager , neal .
once he indicates he intends to sell the whiskey ,
we can move .
no , i @-@ i &apos;m not gonna sell them .
that would be illegal .
this is just , uh -- it &apos;s just a hobby .
it &apos;s a really expensive hobby you got there .
yeah , well , the best ones are .
oh , and , uh , you won &apos;t be making shackleton .
you &apos;ll be making the booze my family used to sell .
mccann . that &apos;s $ 100,000 bottle of whiskey .
they only make 55 a year .
and i &apos;ll need 55 more . can you do it ?
hey . are you listening to me ?
can you do it ?
yeah .
yeah , sorry , i got distracted by the ... higgins @-@ barrow .
i &apos;ve never seen one in person before .
yeah , there it is .
yeah , i can do the job .
that &apos;s great . we &apos;ll , uh , start in a few weeks .
a few weeks ? why wait ?
well , duplicating a mccann isn &apos;t just about what &apos;s inside .
each of the bottles has to be hand @-@ blown .
uh @-@ huh . for your hobby ?
yeah , that &apos;s right .
there &apos;s no reason to have one
if you &apos;re not gonna do it right .
i &apos;ll call you when i find someone .
i can do it .
neal , don &apos;t push it .
can he make the bottles ?
i have no idea .
you &apos;re telling me
that not only can you perfectly imitate the booze
but you can blow the bottles , too ?
well , i need some help from a friend .
the air quality in here is abysmal .
do you know the effect that can have
on the cooling glass ?
and you call that a furnace ?
it &apos;s the best money can buy .
yeah , exactly .
furnaces should have character ,
like the pieces that are born from them .
are you saying you can &apos;t do the job ?
of course i can do the job .
these will do fine .
i &apos;ll also need newspaper .
i prefer the new york times .
planning your restroom breaks already ?
you dampen the paper and char it ,
then use it to shape the piece .
newspaper ?
he &apos;s the best .
yeah , he better be .
you do realize i haven &apos;t blown glass
since before they faked reagan &apos;s death .
i &apos;m a little out of practice .
you &apos;ll be fine , moz .
oh , i &apos;m gonna miss my eyebrows .
along with my bangs .
oh , great . now he &apos;s also big brother .
well , we &apos;re an investment .
let &apos;s show him he made the right choice .
and once he leaves his office , i &apos;m going in there .
why would he need to get into his office ?
i don &apos;t know , but whatever the reason is ,
i know i &apos;m not gonna like it .
good job , moz .
not so out of practice after all .
yep , like riding a horse .
you &apos;re allergic to horses .
whatever .
you got this for a second ?
okay .
i &apos;ll , uh , just stand here , holding molten glass .
yeah , just give me one sec .
hey , what the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ? !
what the hell is he doing ?
uh , i told you ,
i &apos;d never seen a higgins @-@ barrow in person .
and i &apos;ve definitely never tasted it .
you think you can just come in here and drink my booze ?
all agents , be ready to move in .
neal may not make it out of this one .
i was gonna share .
you &apos;re crazy . you know that ?
and you really love your whiskey .
well , that &apos;s the reason that i &apos;m so good at making it .
celebrating a little early , don &apos;t you think ?
no , the glass is coming along well .
we &apos;ll have the first of 55 ready in an hour .
once we &apos;ve perfected the mold --
uh , i actually don &apos;t give a crap .
how long will the rest take ?
a day . maybe two .
one day it is .
well ...
chop @-@ chop .
thanks for the taste .
you broke into his office .
the door was unlocked .
don &apos;t play semantics .
james was telling the truth .
what &apos;d you find ?
flynn has a gun in his whiskey case .
it &apos;s a browning p9r ,
the same model used to kill ellen .
flynn sr. was arrogant enough to hold onto a murder weapon .
you really think his son would do the same ?
he wants to be just like his father .
he &apos;s obsessed with the family &apos;s history ,
getting things back to how they were .
the same model doesn &apos;t mean the same gun .
it means my father was telling the truth .
don &apos;t go off book again .
if we stay the course and arrest him on distribution ,
our warrant will allow us to seize everything in the warehouse .
including the gun ?
yes .
okay , but how ? flynn &apos;s playing it safe with me .
but he &apos;ll talk to the conroys .
the family that used to run their whiskey distribution ?
but according to the files , they haven &apos;t spoken in years .
exactly .
bringing the families back together again
fits right into his sweet spot .
does organized crime have someone undercover with the conroys ?
they do .
he agreed to contact flynn , set up a meet ,
and vouch for one of our agents .
who are you sending ? no .
peter , you can &apos;t . it &apos;s too dangerous .
says the man who broke into flynn &apos;s office
and stole a drink .
this is our best shot at getting them on record .
and it allows you to be there to keep an eye on me .
hmm , guess you &apos;re right .
your cover better be airtight .
which means i need to talk to an expert
on the conroys and flynns .
but they didn &apos;t check his boot .
conroy sr. had a snubnose tucked in there .
problem was , when he went to grab it ,
he couldn &apos;t pull the damn thing out .
that &apos;s when the flynns cut off ties with him .
conroys were lucky that &apos;s all they cut off .
this is all very helpful .
i know .
all right , i &apos;m gonna study up on this ,
and , uh , i &apos;ll see you later .
i should get going , too .
uh , hang on a second .
can you stick around ?
sure .
have a seat .
i saw the whiskey container .
there is a gun in there --
the same kind used to kill ellen .
we get the gun , we get flynn .
i should have taken it .
no , no , no . you did the right thing .
peter has a good plan . you should stick to it .
make sure they don &apos;t get away with this .
do you believe me , neal ?
i want to .
but there &apos;s one thing i don &apos;t understand .
ellen said you told her you were innocent ,
and then you confessed .
why would you confess to a murder you didn &apos;t commit ?
i &apos;ve never told this to anyone , not even ellen .
a couple of days after i was arrested , she came to see me .
she &apos;d done some digging ,
and she realized that i was framed .
she also realized that the flynns
didn &apos;t have the cops in their pocket .
they were working for the cops ,
some people very high up on the force .
and for the first time , i had hope .
but then i got a phone call ,
and the man on the other end of the line
wanted ellen to stop investigating immediately .
he threatened to kill everybody i cared about --
ellen , your mother , you .
the only way to protect everyone was to confess
and turn state &apos;s evidence against the flynns .
the marshals immediately pulled
you and your mother into witness protection .
what about ellen ?
the same .
they were worried the flynns would try and get to her , too .
i thought i &apos;d join you and your mom in witsec ,
but , uh , she filed for divorce .
she wanted separate locations .
i don &apos;t blame her . she thought i was cop killer .
so you gave up everything to keep us safe .
i gave up everything the minute i took that cash .
do you know who was on the phone ?
i don &apos;t .
but you don &apos;t kill a cop and get a phone call
unless it &apos;s somebody very powerful .
police chief maybe .
never could figure that part out .
but flynn would know .
look , if we find out , you can stop running .
i can &apos;t even imagine what that would be like .
i &apos;ll be meeting with flynn as mark conroy .
he &apos;s the most camera @-@ shy of the family .
few know what he looks like , and he &apos;s about my age .
neal &apos;s at the warehouse now , working on the bottles .
i &apos;m scheduled to arrive there in an hour .
once peter uses the trigger phrase ,
&quot; we have a deal , &quot; we move in .
what &apos;s your response time ?
we &apos;ll be two blocks down to avoid any chance of being seen ,
so i &apos;m guessing a minute , 90 seconds tops .
great . let &apos;s move out .
there &apos;s something about
the art of crafting a piece from within
that &apos;s exquisitely challenging .
okay , chihuly , good work .
flynn .
conroy .
hold still .
you know how it is . you can &apos;t be too careful .
you should tell them to go ahead and check my boot .
that &apos;s water under the bridge .
glad to hear it .
check the boot .
is this macken or your forgery ?
you can &apos;t tell by my smile ?
and the glasswork ?
we could make a lot of money on this .
oh , i agree . they did great work .
and , luckily , we won &apos;t be needing them for too much longer .
what do you mean ?
well , we &apos;ve recorded their process .
we can use the video to train our own guys .
but why get rid of them ? are they becoming a problem ?
eh , well , they &apos;ve seen too much , including you now .
it &apos;s just best to be safe .
how many bottles are they making for you ?
55 .
that &apos;s right .
they &apos;re finishing up bottle number 55 right now .
take care of them .
you know , i &apos;d love to meet them before you do .
this is great work .
nah , it &apos;s best if you don &apos;t get too familiar .
never good to name them if you &apos;re not gonna keep them , you know ?
yeah .
then it looks like we have a deal .
that &apos;s our signal . everybody move .
what ?
we haven &apos;t even talked numbers yet .
oh , with this quality work ,
i know we &apos;ll come to an understanding .
i &apos;d like to try some of your other whiskeys .
do you mind ?
uh , help yourself .
oh , this is fantastic , yeah .
fbi . call your men off now .
call them off -- right now .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
neal !
neal .
fbi !
on the ground !
fbi ! check it !
i &apos;m gonna check on peter .
dennis flynn jr . ,
you &apos;re under arrest for intent to distribute counterfeit items
and attempted murder .
and whatever crimes you may have committed with this weapon .
you planted that gun .
i &apos;ve never seen it before in my life .
bet your dad said the same thing .
hey . did forensics come back ?
ballistics matched flynn &apos;s gun to ellen &apos;s murder weapon .
so we got him .
we did .
what aren &apos;t you telling me ?
somebody else got him , too .
flynn was being escorted to a transport car
when he was stabbed to death by a prisoner with a shiv .
someone wanted him dead awfully fast .
very few people knew he was there .
we need to find out who had access to flynn &apos;s release documents .
i &apos;m on it . it &apos;s not a long list .
but the bad news is , we lost flynn and whatever he knows .
well , he must have been working with someone ,
looking for ellen &apos;s evidence box .
someone who knew that flynn &apos;s only angle in prison
would be to turn on them , so flynn had to die and fast .
now , the good news is ,
we forced someone to play their hand .
and like diana said , it &apos;s not a long list .
but whoever it is has an incredible reach .
neal , if they can get to flynn like this ...
james is right .
he isn &apos;t safe here .
i can &apos;t send him away .
only for a little while , until we know more .
he &apos;ll be back .
you don &apos;t know that .
talk to him .
goodbye , neal .
until we meet again .
seeing her again .
thank you for sharing this with me .
ellen said that whatever &apos;s in that pendant
is the key to finding the evidence box .
and hopefully to clearing my name .
so , how do we do it ?
well , i &apos;m listed as her next of kin ,
so now that the flynn case is wrapped up ,
it &apos;ll be sent to me .
great . once we have the key --
once i have the key .
i don &apos;t understand . i @-@ i thought you believed me .
i do . it &apos;s not about that .
you need to leave new york .
no .
it &apos;s not safe for you here .
no , i &apos;ve left you too many times .
they got to ellen . they got to flynn .
they almost got to you .
mozzie has a safe house outside the city .
it &apos;s completely off the radar .
you can stay there .
all right .
i want you to be a part of my life .
thank you .
all right , uh ...
look , once peter and i figure this out ,
we can take them down together .
he &apos;s waiting outside to give you a ride , so ...
i thought i &apos;d never see you again .
okay .
okay .
bye , dad .
see you soon , buddy .
okay .
