thank you so much for having us over for brunch , guys .
it &apos;s the least that we could do to celebrate
the one week anniversary
of your sister moving in with me and becoming my live @-@ in lover .
was a little fast .
babe , you have syrup on your face .
oh , you can get it .
babe , you have some powdered sugar ...
back off ! i &apos;m starving !
come on . just let me get it off .
it &apos;s so much.- get your own french toast , jess !
i got these slices , so they &apos;re for me to eat .
if you want the slices , get your own slices .
um , that &apos;s your fourth plate , winston .
i &apos;m trying to bulk up for the lapd fitness exam .
i am going to ace this obstacle course .
schmidt , you got something crazy around your neck .
abby made this . look .
look at that .
not a fan .
i forgot how much
i love making jewelry .
schmidt &apos;s been lending me money for supplies .
schmidt , are you bleeding ?
oh , look at that . i most certainly am . wow .
what makes abby &apos;s jewelry so interesting
is that it &apos;s actually dangerous and can cut you . oh .
abby &apos;s gonna open up her own store one day . mark my words .
she shouldn &apos;t do that .
nope .
i &apos;m gonna open up a store in your mouth .
but now that you &apos;re living here , i can have my old room back .
jess , i &apos;m gonna need you gone by 5 : 00 .
done . i need a break from snore @-@ a ephron over here .
okay .
oh , schmidt and i don &apos;t need any space . we have no boundaries .
but i guess not everybody can have what schmidt and i have .
you guys will probably get there . don &apos;t worry .
remember how long it took you to get boobs ?
yeah , but i started shaving my legs at nine .
so joke &apos;s on you .
wait . we have so much sex .
don &apos;t try to eat the other slice . i &apos;m gonna get to it .
can you believe abby and schmidt ?
yeah , tell me about it . making love at their own brunch ?
no class .
they &apos;re a fake couple . they &apos;re not real .
we &apos;re a real couple .
if anyone should be moving in together , it &apos;s us .
well , you know , we already live in the same apartment .
right . so why not take the extra step ?
we basically sleep in each other &apos;s rooms every night ,
so what is the difference ?
it &apos;s a really big difference .
because right now we &apos;re roommates
but we &apos;re not living together . not &quot; living together . &quot;
right .
you know ? living together ...
no .
is a step . it &apos;s official .
it &apos;s an official step in a relationship .
so the word &quot; official &quot; is the key .
abby and schmidt did it after one week .
come on . we have so much left to learn about each other ,
stuff you can only learn if you &apos;re crammed together
in a small space and you can &apos;t get out .
just you and me . four walls .
no boundaries , no escape .
when you put it like that , it sounds amazing .
and like prison .
well , i feel like if we get tired of each other ,
i can always run across the hall to my room .
it &apos;s so close . just pop over there .
do you not want to ?
i did not ...
that did not ...
so you &apos;re saying ...
you do want to ?
oh , my god ,
nick , we &apos;re moving in together !
officially ? we just agreed on it ?
yes !
yes ! i cannot think of a reason why not to .
reason 13 : i like my stuff and i hate her stuff .
reason number 14 : how am i ever gonna change my clothes ?
you don &apos;t change in front of your girlfriend ?
you get naked in front of her .
yes , but those are different things . when you &apos;re naked ,
you &apos;re powerful and it &apos;s glorious .
when you &apos;re changing , you &apos;re hunched over
and cowering , like an animal .
animals don &apos;t wear clothes , nick .
all i &apos;m saying is i need my space .
true intimacy . embrace that .
abby and i , we have one sponge .
and we use it for everything .
i don &apos;t like that , but you seem happy .
don &apos;t hold back , nick .
expose your cracks and love will fill them .
that &apos;s nice .
thank you .
do you know how hard it &apos;s been for me to take
this conversation seriously while you &apos;re wearing
that thing around your neck ?
it &apos;s an iroquois throat band .
that &apos;s the ugliest thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
yeah , you &apos;re jealous .
no , i &apos;m not .
it &apos;s not just a choker , it &apos;s a story .
what &apos;s the story ? she didn &apos;t have enough supplies ?
well ...
i &apos;m not through the whole thing yet .
i got to tell you , man ,
looking at that thing , the sex must be awesome .
cece and i have been hanging out a lot more lately .
she sort of treats me like i &apos;m one of her girl friends , and ...
you don &apos;t like it ?
i love it .
i mean , usually , when i &apos;m friends with a girl ,
i &apos;m either trying to get that butt or she &apos;s trying to get this butt .
but with cece , it &apos;s not about the butt .
it &apos;s not about the butt , man . it &apos;s cool .
it &apos;s like ... we &apos;re like ... sisters .
what ?
coach . hey , do you have , uh , schmidt &apos;s keys ?
kind of got a weird favor to ask .
it &apos;s only weird if you don &apos;t ask , girl .
what ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about .
you know i &apos;m doing this for you , right ?
somewhere ...
this is great .
what are we doing ?
we are snooping on abby .
oh , love it .
i do not trust that girl .
she &apos;s always working an angle .
now she &apos;s got schmidt all wrapped up ,
giving her money for &quot; jewelry . &quot;
treachery !
first , they came for my silverware and i said nothing .
what &apos;s up , dawg ?
what are you guys doing here ?
schmidt , i know that abby is fun and she is charming ,
but i &apos;m telling you , she &apos;s bad news .
is that why you guys are sorting through my garbage ?
i appreciate the concern , you guys , but abby has changed .
then how do you explain this ?
i put my coffee grounds in a plastic bag
so it doesn &apos;t get the rest of my trash dirty .
really ?
yeah , he does that .
you got clean @-@ ass trash , man .
i don &apos;t even need gloves for this .
quit sorting through my trash , coach . you &apos;re messing it all up .
sorry ...
schmidt ,
you &apos;ve known this girl for a couple weeks , okay ?
i &apos;ve known her for 20 years , and , i am telling you ,
she &apos;s not to be trusted .
your words are changing his opinions about things .
up top .
you two as friends is a real bummer .
i &apos;m not into it .
our first night living together .
i &apos;m just excited .
expose your cracks
and love will fill them .
i &apos;m changing .
great . i &apos;m reading .
okay .
yeah , i &apos;m just gonna take my pants off .
okay .
you know , i &apos;ve seen you naked before , right ?
what &apos;s going on there ?
oh ! never changed in front of a woman .
you know , mostly you just hook up and ...
really ?
are you serious ?
all right , i &apos;m gonna read .
okay . here we go .
yeah , it &apos;s ...
just gonna put this on here .
what is that ?
oh , this is my long shirt .
yeah . oh .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re laughing . i had it on the wrong way .
that must have been funny @-@ looking the way it was .
i &apos;ve never broken it out before you because , you know ,
we didn &apos;t live together , but ...
it keeps the top really warm
and lets my bottom breathe .
and so ... yeah .
why does your bottom need to breathe ?
well , it &apos;s like
a plant .
needs sun and air to survive .
never mind . um ... i like it .
um ... yeah .
great .
i like it .
okay .
this is great .
this is great .
i &apos;m excited .
me , too .
what are you doing to the pillow ?
i &apos;m trying to get comfortable .
oh , okay .
got it .
got it .
i can &apos;t ...
i &apos;m gonna go to sleep .
turn off the light .
great .
what ? so @-@ sorry . sorry .
what the hell is that nightmare ?
i just ... have to ...
sorry .
just reading ?
yeah . you know what i &apos;m gonna do ?
i &apos;m gonna sleep with my head over there .
okay .
thanks .
yeah , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s gonna be better for me .
you know what , i &apos;m gonna get some water .
oh , hey . my room looks totally different .
turned it into a workout space .
i am so glad it opened up .
oh , why didn &apos;t we do this sooner ?
crab walk .
you don &apos;t know where a crab &apos;s gonna go .
and you know what ?
where does the crab go ? oh !
hi . just enjoying the peace and quiet .
whoa , hold up .
hey , jess , what are you doing ?
i just , you know , sometimes i work in the elevator now .
you know , helping some of the ...
older residents .
this is your floor , ma &apos;am .
so , how are things going with you and schmidt living together ?
i have never felt so clean while being so dirty .
awesome .
last night , schmidt wanted
to take me to a hotel , but we could not even get out
of the loft without ripping each other &apos;s clothes off .
oh , that &apos;s our thing , too .
we have the hotel until tomorrow night and it &apos;s all paid up .
you guys might as well use it . take it off our hands .
lobby , please .
wait , i forgot bernie .
hold the elevator .
bernie , bernie , where are you , you idiot ?
i &apos;ll just be here , waiting .
so , nick , the police academy training
is going well , but
i &apos;m a little worried about the rings , because of the ...
you know ... the incident .
shut up , you guys , i can do this .
no , miller , no , miller , no !
i &apos;m sor ... i got big laughs .
you got to give the people what they want .
everybody saw my ding @-@ a @-@ ling ,
nick . my ding @-@ a @-@ ling .
i &apos;ve got an issue that &apos;s more important than this .
ever since jess moved in , i haven &apos;t had a second to myself .
you see what she &apos;s done to my writer &apos;s desk ?
it &apos;s like an arts and crafts area now , man .
hey , guys .
i &apos;m staying at a hotel tonight .
not alone . with other people .
i have to chaperone a field trip to sacramento , so ...
you know what , you seem too busy to talk about it . go , go .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
i &apos;m gonna miss you .
wait , weren &apos;t you just saying how you ...
whoa , dude !
good one , nick . bye .
bye , yeah .
that , uh , i &apos;m , uh , i &apos;m sorry .
i can &apos;t believe i let you guys
talk me into tailing my own girlfriend .

i feel very uncomfortable being here , i trust abby ,
i don &apos;t want to spy on her any more , okay ?
we don &apos;t spy , we just carefully watching .

yeah , she is .
let us bust her , buster .
that was a good one .

well , that &apos;s not surprising .
oh , you can do this . you can do this , winnie .
what are you doing here ?
on a school day ?
i see this means you &apos;re the cutting type .
which means you &apos;re the pantsing type .
well , i got news for you , buddy .
you ain &apos;t getting &apos; em !
not today .
how &apos; bout i take your pants , huh ?
not like that , everybody !
i &apos;m not trying to take the little kid &apos;s pants .
he &apos;s trying to take my pants .
you see how he &apos;s eyeing my pants ?
so i eyed his pants ...
you know what ?
you win .
you win , you little son of a bitch .
you win !
i don &apos;t want to tell you how to police your beach ,
but right now there are truants
outside of this hotel , stirring up trouble .
hey , yo , lookin &apos; good , charlie !
debbie , see you at 1 : 00 on the massage table .
winston .
we are gonna sneak into schmidt &apos;s
and see what &apos;s really inside those boxes .
cece , darling ...
hmm ?
what ?
how long have we been friends ?
a week or so ?
and have i ever steered you wrong ?
well , no ...
exactly . because i know you
better than anyone , girl .
and you &apos;re acting like a lunatic .
i mean , the kind of lunatic
other lunatics look at and go ,
&quot; oh , my god , that bitch a lunatic . &quot;
so i &apos;m gonna need you
to figure out why you &apos;re
really doing all this for schmidt ...
... and then sort it out .
you did not just say that to me .
think about it , girl . shoot ...
just to be clear , i did not ask you to act like this , okay ?
it &apos;s just kind of fun to do ...
slow down , girl .
you gonna eat that scone ?
damn it .
slow down .
are you @-@ are you gonna have this scone ?
hey , man .
hey , man .
just looking at my garbage pail kids .
jess makes me put &apos; em in a box .
how are you gonna put art like this in a box ?
what &apos;s going on with you ?
nothing ...
you will not tell nick
that you saw me here because then he &apos;ll get upset
and i &apos;m gonna have to move into my old room ,
and that means that we suck as a couple and that abby was right
and i cannot let that happen .
jess went to a hotel because sharing a room with you
is driving her crazy .
dude , that really was a tough one to keep in ,
but , honestly , i held my own and i did my best .
are you kidding me ? !
i can &apos;t believe it ! i changed in front of her !
sharing a room is driving you crazy , too .
but i didn &apos;t lie about it .
i never get to win these things .
so , anyway , i just want to apologize .
it was wrong of me to get involved .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to tap abby &apos;s phone ?
run a dna sample ?
i don &apos;t want to be coarse , but the bedroom is covered in it .
i was worried about you , okay ?
i didn &apos;t want her to take advantage of you
&apos;cause i know that you will do ...
anything for the people that you care about .
well , i guess i could say the same thing about you .
and , you know what , maybe abby has changed .
i &apos;m thinking about helping abby lease a @-@ a storefront
for her jewelry . is that crazy ?
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s amazing . don &apos;t hold back .
here . here , i want you to have this .
oh .
abby made it .
it &apos;s a cough drop and ...
these are hard candies .
i see that .
i ... truly hate it .
you &apos;re welcome .
oh .
oh , hey .
how was sacramento ?
it was great . the kids cried
when they saw the capital .
oh , did they ?
how many students showed up ?
30 .
what hotel did you stay at ?
old sacramento inn .
what room did you stay in ?
523 .
what floor was that on ?
five .
was there an elevator to the fourth floor ?
fifth floor .
smoking or non @-@ smoking ?
smoking .
you don &apos;t smoke .
in sacramento , i do .
what &apos;d you have for breakfast ?
continental .
how are you this good at lying ? !
i know you &apos;re making this all up ! i know you didn &apos;t go
to sacramento . i know you went to a hotel to be by yourself .
damn it , winston !
nick loved being alone , too !
damn it , winston !
that &apos;s for my ding @-@ a @-@ ling !
you didn &apos;t like living together either ?
no ,
but it was your idea , and it seemed like the thing to do .
but at least i didn &apos;t lie about it , jess .
okay , i did ! but you were driving me crazy .
you wear a nightgown .
are you talking about my long shirt ?
you look like the little match girl ,
wandering around victorian england
selling matches for a penny .
i look like george washington .
i was just trying to be a good couple .
schmidt and abby are doing it .
schmidt and abby are crazy . they &apos;re doing a lot of things .
why can &apos;t we do this ?
i don &apos;t know .
hey .
hey .
last time i saw you day @-@ drinking
was when you got kicked out of jazz ensemble .
i &apos;m still pissed off about that .
what does that mean , &quot; too enthusiastic &quot; ?
how come you &apos;re not at the hotel ? did you and nick break the bed ?
because , legally , they cannot make you pay for that .
no . i was by myself .
oh , i &apos;ve broken the bed by myself .
big @-@ time .
no , i went to the hotel to get away from nick .
and i wore a robe and i watched
a documentary about ethel kennedy
and it was one of the best nights of my life .
so you win . your relationship &apos;s
better than mine .
and i can &apos;t even share a room with nick .
i don &apos;t win . come on .
i swing from guy to guy .
i don &apos;t think i have ever paid my own rent .
you travel the world , collecting lovers .
all my lovers could fit in one suv .
and , yes , maybe somebody would have to sit on someone &apos;s lap ,
but they would fit .
and you &apos;re just ... brave .
you and nick are brave .
you guys know each other , you get under each other &apos;s skin .
he has the feet of a hippy cult leader .
but that &apos;s the difference .
i just throw myself into whatever comes along because ...
i really don &apos;t want to be alone .
why not ? being alone &apos;s great .
you should try it sometime .
seriously . it might help you figure yourself out .
you &apos;re abby freaking day .
you can do whatever you want .
except vote .
but , seriously ,
you should &apos;ve seen nick &apos;s feet .
the bottoms are all black , except for one patch of yellow .
hey . what are you doing ?
hey . oh , just packing up your things and then i ...
thought about what you would want and how you probably didn &apos;t
want to move again , so i decided to do the right thing
and just take your room .
my room &apos;s bigger .
is it ? i never ...
nice try .
all right .
i got to move some stuff back then .
i &apos;m sorry that this didn &apos;t work out .
i &apos;m sorry that we sucked .
look , we don &apos;t suck .
i &apos;m crazy about you , but i don &apos;t have to spend every second
with you in what amounts to a one @-@ room log cabin .
cabins are what drove the pilgrims crazy .
that &apos;s why they killed each other
at the plymouth rock massacre .
that &apos;s not a real thing .
so how did the millions of pilgrims die ?
there definitely weren &apos;t millions of pilgrims .
then how do you explain my 37 @-@ page essay about it ?
i think you made it up in your head .
this seems like one of those
&quot; agree to disagree &quot; moments ...
no . it &apos;s not .
i &apos;m also older than you .
anyway ,
i love you and someday we &apos;ll make this work .
i think so , too . just @-@ just not now .
not like this .
yeah . yeah .
but if you &apos;re not doing anything , want to come over ?
i am over .
hey , guys .
just a little hot goss from apartment 4c .
abby &apos;s gone .
what ?
she &apos;s gonna
stay with your mom for a little bit .
something about saving up to be independent ?
good for her .
i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s okay . you know ...
in hindsight , maybe we moved a little bit too fast .
i just wish that i had realized that
before i rented her a storefront .
you rented her a storefront ?
it was a three @-@ year lease in an undesirable neighborhood .
it totally obliterated my bank account ,
so ... i &apos;ve decided to sublet my place , and ...
i &apos;ll be moving back here , under duress .
y @-@ you &apos;re moving back in here ?
well , shouldn &apos;t be a problem right ?
coach is in my room , and you guys are now moving in together .
and , um ...
i &apos;ll just move into jess &apos; room . cool ?
yeah , but , like ...
asking was just kind of a formality .
&apos;cause my name &apos;s on the lease , so ... you guys are the best .
cool .
great .
let &apos;s do this .
we can make it work .
you have to start washing your feet .
