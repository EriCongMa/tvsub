I don't know what happened to you when you were away.
That's right.
You don't know the first thing about it.
I'm not gonna allow you
to jump back on Ali's crazy train.
Not with Tanner circling
and "A" watching our every move.
What we should be doing is burning this stuff.
Emily, Ali is not our friend right now.
Ali's not the problem, Spencer.
Melissa is.
We both know Ali wasn't kidnapped.
Sooner or later, she's gonna get what she deserves.
We go to Tanner and we tell her the truth.
What about New York?
We can't just come half clean.
It was self-defense and you were protecting us.
I have a plan.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
The problem is you'll throw us
all under a bus just to pull it off.
We need to cut ties with Ali now.
Tonight.
Seems to me we've been here before.
We'll get it right this time.
This time is different.
After this, Ali's on her own.
Wait.
That's when Ali came to my hospital room
after Mona's party.

We can't tell now.
Why not?
Because no one will believe
we didn't know Ali was alive if they see this.
Hey, you can't!
It won't do any good!
Spencer, put down the brick.
Put it down.
Hanna wanted to go check up on Caleb
and Aria went home.
Here.
I can't drink coffee right now.
Oh, it's decaf.
I bought it for the whipped cream.
Are you feeling better?
Not better, less stupid.
Thank you for stopping me.
Save it for a real target.
What, "A" in the flesh?
That's one candidate.
What are you thinking?
"We're all in this together."
I mean that could be "A" or...
it could be Alison.
Or "A" wanting us to think it's Alison.
It's Alison.
Are you going to answer?
I think we need to hit the mute button for right now.
Hey, how are you?
You are the one who held in there the longest with her.
I wasn't defending Ali.
I was defending somebody from a long time ago.
Maybe somebody who never existed.
God, the thing I had with Paige was so genuine.
Now...
Can you fix it?
Sure, yeah.
I can go up to Paige and say, "So you were right all along.
My bad.
Let's kiss and make-up."
It's Ali.
Maybe she's looking for us.
She must be nervous.
Not as nervous as her dad.
He's taking her out of town.
He's worried about the kidnapper.
Ali's lucky that they released him when they did.
Yeah...
Real lucky.
Don't play with your comfort food.
Jeez, you scared the hell out of me.
What is this?
Nothing.
I thought we had a deal.
It wasn't so much a deal, okay?
It was more like an understanding.
Yeah, that we would stop drinking.
It helps me when I can't sleep, okay?
Why can't you sleep?
What happened with the police?
We never made it.
Why not?
Because "A" chopped us off at the ankles, that's why not.
And look, we can't be telling people we haven't seen Alison
when there are pictures of her leaving my hospital room
when she was supposed to be dead.
"A" has those pictures?
We're back where we started.
We always end up back where we started.
Go ahead.
I won't stop you.
Can I talk to you?
Everything about the Manhattan Project is fun.
It's the place where the Cold War started.
And J. Robert Oppenheimer is dreamy.
I don't think I can put that in the report.
Want some more hot chocolate, Mr. Mike?
Uh, sure.
How about you?
No, thanks.
How could she identify a kidnapper
when she was never kidnapped?
She knew him from when she was on her own.
The name he gave the police was Cyrus Petrillo.
Have you ever heard that name,
in all the time you were doing your research?
Uh, no, I don't have much from when she was gone.
It's a blank.
But why would this guy confess to a crime he didn't commit?
Maybe he knew it wouldn't stick.
Maybe he knew Ali wouldn't confirm the story until it was too late.
Yeah, but if you're this guy,
why would you even take that chance?
Because somebody has something worse to use against you.
Have you seen this before?
No.
Where did you get this?
A friend of a friend.
I'll see what I can find out about Cyrus.
Thanks.
Thanks for trusting me.
You're the only one who might be able
to help me get the answers that I need.
I have to trust you.
Well then, thank you for your honesty.
You need anything?
I'm okay.
Well, Mike took Mona home.
Dad.
Mike and Mona is a very bad idea.
Well, he likes her and she seems to like him.
"Seems to."
I understand that you and Mona
have more than the usual amount of history,
but you know what'll happen
if either one of us tries to talk to Mike.
Yep, he'll double-down.
So I suggest we keep an eye on the situation,
but keep our distance.
I'll try.
Okay.
Oh, your mom is coming back from Scranton in the morning.
And we have those tickets for tomorrow night.
I had my fedora re-blocked for the occasion.
Just the four of us.
It's been a long time since we've done that.
Too long.
Your brother deserves way better than Mona.
Boys hate it when you question their judgment.
If I try to tell Mike that Mona isn't what he's looking for--
You won't be able to separate them with a crowbar.
Colorful, Em.
Graphic, but colorful.
You guys, I had a bad thought.
Well, why should you be any different?
Share.
"A" doesn't want us telling the truth about Ali
because they like to see us suffer.
Not new information.
But who besides "A" wants to keep us quiet?
Are you thinking about somebody in particular?
Mona.
Not Mona.
Who's left?
Alison.
That is a bad thought.
I got to go.
Me, too. Later.
Hey, wait a second.
Is this another bad thought?
Do you still talk to that guy Dean?
My sober-coach?
Not since my mom fired him.
Why?
Well, do you have his number?
It's not for me, it's for Caleb.
What's wrong?
I don't know and he won't tell me.
Is this about his drinking?
Part of it.
You can't just introduce Caleb to a total stranger and say,
"let's talk about addiction."
Spencer, I have to do something.
I think there's somebody better for him to talk to.
Sydney may be a liar, but she's a damn good swimmer.
I liked having her on the team.
She still is on the team.
That way we can keep an eye on her.
How does it feel, being back in the locker room?
Feels good.
Seems like the only place I see you is at practice.
I know.
It's...
Complicated.
Paige, we need to talk.
Maybe tonight?
I've got something tonight, but, yeah, we should talk.
Okay.
Okay.
Do I call you Officer Toby
or Cadet Toby?
I like cadet.
Sounds like you're in Space Command.
Can you come over?
I need to talk to you.
No, it's about Caleb.
It will be easier if you're here.
It's always easier when you're here.
Thanks, Toby.
Bye.
Are you sure about this?
Caleb will listen to him.
Never underestimate the power of a good bromance.
Spence.
It's from Melissa.
I'd recognize that anal-retentive handwriting anywhere.
Melissa!
What is it?
Melissa's gone.
Where'd she go?
"I have to write this quickly.
Dad's taking me to the airport.
I'm sorry.
You'll know everything soon. I promise."
Why would your dad make her leave?
I don't know.
Melissa said that Spencer should know everything soon.
What does that mean?
It means what it always means.
Nobody tells you anything when you want to know it,
only when they feel like telling it.
And then they only tell you enough
to make you crazy to know more.
Has anyone talked to Ali?
She calls, but I don't pick up.
You guys, I had a bad thought.
I'm sorry, they just keep showing up in my head.
What's this one?
Ali left town, but "A" said she couldn't.
What changed?
Well, Ali made a deal with Noel.
Maybe she made a deal with somebody else?
You're thinking she made a deal with "A" to leave town?
What kind of deal?
Hello, girls.
Lucky to get most of you at the same time.
I was hoping we could talk.
My treat.
You're going to make an excellent authority figure.
Where is everybody?
My mom is taking marathon depositions
and my dad is staying at his club,
which was something I only thought men did in old movies.
And Melissa?
I don't know, she may be back in Europe.
She may be at the Edgewood Motor Court.
The only thing I know for sure is that she isn't here.
Hey, when was the last time you saw Caleb?
Couple of nights after my house blew up.
I checked at the cabin to see if he needed anything.
How did he seem to you?
Why don't you tell me?
Hanna stopped drinking, but he hasn't.
He says it helps him sleep.
Maybe it does.
I think there's more to it than that.
You think or Hanna thinks?
He's different.
Not in big ways, but just...
little things.
Such as?
He looks...
There's a word that's lost all of its meaning,
but it's what I think of when I see him.
What word?
Haunted.
What?
It's not drinking.
It's something else.
What makes you say that?
Because I saw that look that you're talking about.
I saw it when he came back from Ravenswood.
You're concerned about the suspect
who was released prematurely.
I want to assure you, we will catch him.
That's good to know.
Take reasonable precaution,
report anything out of the ordinary, anything.
Let us decide what's relevant.
We will.
Oh, I have been meaning to ask you all something.
Who do you think killed Bethany Young?
Who do we think killed her?
Well, you must have thought about it.
How she was killed on the same night Alison was kidnapped.
I haven't given it much thought.
Really?
None of us knew Bethany Young.
I know that.
We haven't been able to find a single connection
between you and the dead girl.
Except, that she was killed 30 yards away
from where you all were sleeping.
I just thought you might have talked about it.
I guess girls are different from when I was your age.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Just hold it until she's out of sight.
Hanna, we're all set.
All you have to do is get Caleb to the Applerose Grille.
Tanner thinks we killed Bethany Young.
What-- what are you talking about?
Tanner. She thinks we did it.
Did she say this to you?
Not in so many words.
How many words, Hanna, and in what order?
Hey, the front door bell's out.
Could you please go get that?
Sure.
Hanna, where are you?
And when did this happen?
At the Mermaid Cafe.
Me and Emily and Aria.
She came up to tell us
that they were trying to catch Cyrus what's-his-name,
but then she ends up saying
they're trying to connect us with Bethany.
There is no connection.
There wasn't before, but there is now.
We made it ourselves,
when Aria got those drawings
and you went to go meet a man about a horse.
Spencer, I don't think the police believe a thing
that Ali is saying.
And they still think that we're the five Mouseketeers.
And I have Toby here.
Just get Caleb to the Apple Rose Grille, 7:30.
And then we'll talk then.
Your sister isn't at the Edgewood Motor Court.
You want some privacy?
Spencer.
You were right.
I have to tell you the truth before it's too late.
Dad's taking me to the airport.
I'm going back to England.
He's been wanting me to go back
since I told him what I told him in the police station
the night you were gone.
Maybe Dad's right
and there's nothing to do but keep quiet.
But I can't just leave you.
Not again.
Not like this.
So I'm going to tell you the truth
and you can do whatever you want with it.
Maybe it will help you,
maybe it won't,
but at least, you'll know.
I saw you the night Alison disappeared.
I heard you fighting with her and I saw you.
I saw you with a shovel in your hand.
It felt like everyone who ever made the mistake
of touching Ali was there that night.
What's that line from The Tempest?
"This island is full of noises."
Then I saw the body.
I thought you killed Alison with that shovel.
Now I'm not sure what happened.
But standing there that's what I thought.
And I didn't want anybody to know.
I couldn't look at her face,
so I pushed her in and covered her up
and I didn't tell anybody about what I did
or what I thought you did.
Now I know it wasn't Alison.
And she wasn't dead when I buried her.
She was a stranger and I buried her alive.
Because I thought I was protecting you.
Our family has a gift for self-preservation.
But there's a point when you go from survivor to predator.
And I guess that's what happened to us.
Good-bye, Spencer.
I love you.
Okay, don't push him, Toby.
When I feel like Caleb's relaxed enough,
I'll tap you on the foot and that's the heads-up
that I'm going to change the subject.
Don't make such a big deal out of this, Hanna.
It is a big deal.
Okay.
Are you all right?
Sure.
Okay, he's coming, just play dumb.
Hanna.
He knows what I'm talking about.
So Hanna says you're having trouble sleeping.
What's the deal with that?
Don't look at me.
This must be how boys communicate.
Okay, what is this?
She's worried about you.
So is Spencer and to tell you the truth, me, too.
Who died and made you Oprah?
So there is something wrong.
Caleb, Hanna's scared.
If you walk away, she's still going to be afraid.
Do you want things to stay like that?
I didn't think you worked this shift anymore.
I don't.
I mean I'm just helping out tonight.
Are you going somewhere?
I mean you must be going somewhere.
Yes, I am going somewhere.
In fact I got to go.
Okay.
Have a good night.
Thanks.
Hey, you made it.
Yeah, sorry, I'm late.
Your mom had to cancel.
Lucky me.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's screening
will be starting in just a few moments,
so please silence your cell phones.
Thank you.
They're talking.
Talking is good.
What can he say to Toby that he can't say to me?
Sometimes people want to tell you things,
but they just can't look you in the eye and say it.
Why not?
Because they're afraid of what you'll think of them...
that they let you down...
that you let them down.
Well, if you love someone,
you should be able to tell them anything.
That's the theory.
It's human nature.
You go around this town tonight,
you'll find a lot of guys
who need to take the edge off to get some sleep.
Why even gamble?
Why not just deal with the thing
that's ruining your sleep?
Cure the problem, symptoms go away.
All due respect, you don't know what my problems are.
Not true.
I've been there.
Been where?
Ravenswood.
You were a tourist, man, I lived there.
And maybe you brought some of it back with you.
Don't push this, Toby.
What are you so scared of
that you'd rather drink than face it?
What are you so scared of that you'd push Hanna away?
You are crossing a very serious line right now.
Do you drink during the day?
No, I cut that out.
Why?
Because I got scared.
Of what?
Say it out loud.
I should have kept walking.
Hey, Miriam!
Is your name Miriam?
Why, yes.
How did you...
Miriam, where are you?
Miriam!
Hey, Miriam, come on, stop fooling.
I promised you dinner.
Yeah, I just don't feel like I earned it.
You tried.
All I did was screw it up.
Toby...
Don't you run out on me, too.
I'm not.
I'm not running out on you.
I'm sorry.
I was-- I was just mad at myself.
Are you okay?
Compared to what?
Well, does this have anything to do with what Melissa sent you?
No.
Yes, maybe.
What was it?
It was a going-away present, a little "Forget-me-not."
What was in the envelope?
I think it was the truth.
Only now that I have it,
I don't know what I'm gonna do with it.
So this was taken 16 months ago
at a branch off the Turnpike, near Donegal.
You can tell by the code that's in the time stamp.
If you have that code,
you can find also some other interesting images.
Cyrus Petrillo.
Also known as Cyrus Hart,
Robert Hart and Cy Enfield,
none of them solid citizens.
He's been arrested half a dozen times.
You have to know where to look, but it's all petty stuff.
No convictions.
I wonder what she promised him to get him to confess.
You seem pretty sure that that's what happened.
All makes sense.
At least the way Ali thinks.
She has an amazing gift for knowing
just what a person wants, what they're missing.
It's a very special talent,
one that causes a lot of damage.
Now when I nod my head, you just try to cry on.
I bet you can't do it.
All right now, just wait for the nod of my head.
She's been gone a long time.
I'll go check on her.
Mona?
You are very good.
You know right where to put the knife
and you're not afraid to twist it.
Alison underestimated you.
Look...
I'm sorry.
Don't insult me.
You're right.
Your dad should hate me.
He should throw me out of the house,
after all the things I've done to you,
the way I've treated Mike.
He deserves someone much nicer than me.
He deserves someone who is nice,
which I am not.
Maybe I should have just died
when I fell off that stupid cliff.
Don't say that.
Mona, don't ever say that.
I'm just trying to protect myself.
That's all I've ever been doing,
just protect myself from her.
Is that why you built an army?
It's hard to keep the troops in line
when Alison offers them candy and a smile
and that lilting little laugh.
Maybe you won't believe this, but I'll say it anyway.
When she finishes with me,
she'll come after you and the others.
She can't trust you anymore.
Not after Cyrus and... not after New York.
What about New York?
I know some things and I can guess at some others.
I have to ask you something.
What?
Do you think Mike really likes me?
Maybe Dad's right
and there's nothing to do but keep quiet.
But I can't just leave you.
Not again.
Not like this.
You were always very good at leaving, Melissa.
You had a flair for the grand exit.
And there were times you'd walk up those stairs
and I just wanted to applaud.
What's that line from The Tempest?
"This island is full of noises."
"Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not."
Then I saw the body.
And you thought I did it.
You're the one who really killed her.
Poor Melissa.
She was a stranger and I buried her alive.
Because I thought I was protecting you.
Good-bye, Spencer.
I love you.
Good-bye, Melissa.
Hey, is Mike back from dropping off Mona?
Not yet.
What happened?
We had a pretty long talk in the ladies'.
Anything resolved?
Well, what's said in the powder room stays in the powder room.
I think things will be okay with Mike.
I just have to keep an eye on her.
Good.
Who's that?
Probably Lt. Tanner.
Tanner?
Why? What is she doing here?
She left a voicemail.
She wanted to talk to me.
About what?
That's what I'm going to find out now.
Going somewhere?
I shouldn't have come back here.
But you had no right to pull some stupid intervention on me.
Well, you're right about that.
So I came here to apologize.
But that was an hour ago and I changed my mind,
sitting here in the dark,
wondering if you were in an alley somewhere
or wrapped around a tree.
I can take care of myself.
No, you can't.
What?
I said, no, you can't.
You think you can and usually you can,
but this time you're wrong.
And you know it.
Caleb, I will fight for you, but you have to trust me.
If we don't trust each other,
then I might as well just help you pack.
What did you want to ask me?
Um, not so much ask, just talk.
I've been talking to all the parents of Alison's friends.
And you've been talking to the friends.
Sometimes without any adults around.
I know the rules, Mr. Montgomery.
No one's trying to trick the girls.
They just need to know how serious this is.
It seems to me that you should be putting your energy
into finding the kidnapper that you released.
A man confesses to a crime,
then disappears the moment he's released.
What do you think changed his mind?
I have no idea.
This town ranks surprisingly low on curiosity.
Well, we may not have a lot of imagination,
but we expect the police to do their job.
I'll tell you something about homicide investigations.
They tend to get less complicated
as you work them, not more.
If they start getting more complicated,
you can be sure that someone is doing that on purpose...
someone smart.
And there are so many smart people involved in this case.
It makes my job very interesting.
Well, I'm only interested in where your job affects my daughter.
You want to know if the police are interested in Aria?
We are.
She may or may not be involved in a homicide,
but I'm certain she's part of the complications.
Well, if you're so sure,
why haven't you done something about it,
instead of harassing these girls?
I wouldn't call it harassing.
I've just been waiting for one of them to step up
and say that they are willing to tell me the truth.
And now one of them has.
And I expect to have
a very enlightening conversation with her tomorrow.
I just thought you might want to know.
Which one wants to talk to you?
Goodnight, Mr. Montgomery.
I'm not talking to Tanner.
Neither am I.
Well, I couldn't think it was you.
Where's Hanna?
I called all of you,
but her phone went to voicemail.
It's not Hanna.
Oh, my God.
Alison.
Maybe we can stop her.
How?
Where did you get this?
Ezra.
Who else was going to help us?
Well, it's the end of
Ali's kidnap story if we use this.
Maybe.
Depends on what "Truth" she decides to tell this time.
I have to show you guys something.
I'm sorry I can't wait for Hanna.
They called it a pact,
but what this town made was a contract.
With this preacher.
With what the preacher represented.
But contracts have loopholes.
So what did you do, you and the others?
We took the jars down to the bridge
where the car went in the water that first night.
And we opened them...
all of them and released whatever was inside.
And what happened?
Nothing for a minute.
Then the woods were filled with fireflies...
millions of them.
They drifted up into the trees and...
they were gone.
Mrs. Grunwald called it "A great ascendency."
And after that?
No demons, no messages, no revenge.
And no Miranda.
She was gone.
Then you kept your promise.
You took care of her.
I have--
I've spent this whole time trying to talk myself into that.
You did help her, Caleb.
And now you're back with me.
I'm not the same person that I was when I left here.
Yes, you are.
I know you.
You see this?
It's just a game, a toy. Right?
That's a lie.
This is real.
People turned it into a game
and they forgot what it's really for.
They forgot because they were afraid of it.
Hanna, there is a whole another world,
just right past the corner of our eye.
And I've seen it.
That's why you can't sleep.
I can sleep.
I just...
I'm afraid of my own dreams.
Why?
After she died,
first time Miranda talked to me was in a dream.
I'm just afraid that she's going to show up again
and she's gonna--
she's gonna tell me that it was all wrong
and that she's not okay
and that it's my fault.
Look, maybe you're not the person
you were when you left.
But I'm not exactly who I used to be either.
Caleb, we'll get through this.
I didn't come this far not to have a happy ending.
Goodbye, Spencer.
I love you.
I just got that today.
It took me a while to decide
whether or not to show it to you.
Understood.
Melissa killed Bethany Young.
She thought that she just buried her.
She thought that I killed her.
She doesn't sound so sure of that now.
But the police think that we all had something to do with this.
When Melissa saw Bethany,
she was wearing Alison's clothes.
Another set of Alison's clothes.
There had to be a duplicate set.
Ali wasn't walking around naked.
Are you saying it was always someone's idea
that Bethany take Ali's place?
Tell me another way
that Bethany ends up in that yellow top.
We need to figure out a way around that picture of "A"
at the hospital or we're busted.
What picture of "A"?
Picture of Alison.
No, you said a picture of "A."
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.
Slip of the tongue.
Spencer, what are you gonna do with that?
