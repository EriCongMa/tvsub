okay , who would hate to miss the chance of a lifetime
by not helping me build a duck village today ?
that was some tricky wording .
that &apos;s how he gets us .
i got it -- i would not hate to miss
the chance of a lifetime by not helping you .
but only &apos; cause i have work .
i &apos;ve got a driving lesson .
uh , something .
honey , you found those eggs weeks ago ,
and they still haven &apos;t hatched .
should you prepare yourself for the possibility
that they might be ...
alligators ?
dead .
what ? !
can you believe your sister ?
yeah , i do . they &apos;re dead .
the only thing that &apos;s dead in this kitchen
is your childlike sense of wonder .
morning , dunphys .
oh , still no ducks , huh ?
fascinating creatures . i just read a book about them .
you did ?
yes , mom . dylan reads .
it was my nephew &apos;s book .
it was about a duck and a penguin
who go on vacation together .
you could touch the duck &apos;s fuzz .
bloop @-@ bloop !
that &apos;s the sound she makes when she wants me to fast @-@ forward .
i feel you , money .
claire does the same thing to me .
i think it started when i was inventing that new dental floss .
bloop @-@ bloop @-@ bloop @-@ bloop !
so , the book said ducklings imprint on their mom
as soon as they &apos;re born .
their brains are so small , they just latch on to something
and follow it around as a way to find food .
yum .
so , dylan , i &apos;m building a duck village later .
you want to help ?
that &apos;s some tricky wording on that question .
he &apos;d love to , but he &apos;s still --
it &apos;s time ! boil some towels !
every time i have an egg ? really ?
tucker goes deep !
watch it .
cam !
hut , hut , hut ! munch , you open ?
oh , he &apos;s open !
right there ! there it is !

we have been renting the upstairs unit to some frat boys
from cam &apos;s old college .
they &apos;re here for some big game
and to try and get on &quot; the price is right . &quot;
unfortunately for me ,
it has brought out cam &apos;s &quot; bromosexual &quot; side .
epic throw , bro .
yeah !
actually , that is a cashmere throw ,
which now has a footprint on it .
dudes , beer pong !
pong , pong , pong !
beers are in the fridge , bros .
fridge , fridge , fridge , fridge !
no , hang on , bro .
what &apos;s up , sweetie ?
oh , look who &apos;s back .
um , so i see that you invited your friends again today .
yeah , aren &apos;t they fun ? and how cute is jace ?
we held hands earlier .
we were arm wrestling , but it still counts .
we found the fridge !
yo , you did !
that &apos;s jace .
how many s &apos;s in &apos; jace &apos; ? i heard 12 .
i &apos;m just trying to make our guests feel comfortable .
all right , let &apos;s do this !
why is daddy talking like that ?
she crazy .
ay , what is it ? !
you can always tell when something &apos;s wrong .
what is her name ?
chelsea , the prettiest barista who &apos;s ever served me
a double @-@ shot half @-@ caff caramel macchiato
with a dusting of cinnamon .
i want to talk to her ,
but whenever i do , all i can say is .
maybe you used up all your words ordering that coffee .
why are you so scared ?
any woman would be so lucky to look into those beautiful eyes
and listen to that sweet voice .
she &apos;s so -- - my show is on !
ay , que linda ...
mariela morales is my favorite actress ,
and she &apos;s staying in a hotel in town
under the fake name carmelita contreras .
i am going to wait for her at the lobby ,
and i know i sound like a stalker ,
but -- but this is very different ,
because when we meet , we &apos;re going to be best friends .
i can already smell her hair .
okay , commercials .
so , this is what you &apos;re going to do .
first you &apos;re gonna take me to the hotel to meet mariela .
i &apos;m gonna invite her over for dinner tonight .
she has a charity event at 5 : 00,
but they &apos;re not serving food .
stalker .
while i &apos;m with mariela ,
you &apos;re gonna go back to your coffee girl
and you &apos;re gonna give her the chance to get to know you .
you really think i --
commercial is over .
this show again ?
yes .
i don &apos;t know what it is . i love this character so much .
who &apos;s the old crank ?
her husband , of course .
who &apos;s the disaster with the scarf ?
her son , pepito .
you at least look like your guy .
my guy -- - can it , pepito .
hey , honey .
can you read that ?
&quot; quack nicholson . &quot;
oh , good .
if i spent the whole morning painting these
tiny duck mailboxes and no one could read them ,
i &apos;d feel pretty ridiculous .
phil , duck feed !
hey , that &apos;s almost my name .
or &quot; i &apos;m sorry &quot; ?
you &apos;re right . i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ll , uh --
i &apos;ll sweep that up in a minute .
just come over here and help dust me off .
i &apos;ve got an important meeting ,
and i can &apos;t go into the office covered in flaxseed .
it &apos;s actually a proprietary blend
of oats , grub worms , and cricket parts .
and we &apos;re dusting .
yeah , sorry .
yeah . you &apos;re not nervous about the meeting today , are you ?
yeah , i am .
this is the first time i &apos;m pitching closet @-@ design ideas
to my dad and his pretentious creative team .
you mean the young guys with the walking sticks
at the christmas party ?
yes .
they don &apos;t think anybody in corporate can do what they do ,
but my ideas are good .
or they suck .
i &apos;ve got it !
i &apos;m sure your ideas are great . stop doubting .
the more you believe in yourself , the more they will .
thank you .
hey , nerds .
ignore this .
so , what &apos;s this super @-@ fun project
you want me to help you with ?
we are building a duck village .
um , hey , mom ,
my driving instructor just canceled on me .
oh , shoot , fine . fine , i &apos;ll take you .
oh , shoot , fine . i &apos;ll sit in the back .
no , no , no . you &apos;re gonna stay here and help phil .
let &apos;s go meet your cousins .
well , thanks , uncle mitch .
yeah .
you know luke has failed that driver &apos;s test twice now , right ?
my options today are frat house , duck village , or car crash .
i &apos;m feeling very comfortable with my decision .
what are you doing with those lights ?
i &apos;m trying to get some heat on these eggs .
due to a grocery mishap ,
they spent about seven minutes in the fridge .
so , uh , eggs he found a month ago ,
building a whole village for them now ...
how &apos;s everything at home ? okay ?
there is some debate as to the alive @-@ ness of the ducklings .
but i have to say ,
living with that kind of belief and optimism ,
it just rubs off on you .
i am just gonna ...
this should keep my eggs warm .
you are just so quiet . what am i doing wrong ?
nothing .
silence makes me nervous .
talk about something .
tell me about your day .
uh , okay .
well , this morning , uh , i woke up
and almost got my nose broken by a football .
we have some frat guys staying upstairs ,
and cam hangs out with them a lot .
and you &apos;re not okay with that ?
i don &apos;t know . i @-@ i guess .
who cares ?
come on , let me in .
okay , if i &apos;m being honest ,
i find cam &apos;s behavior a little embarrassing ,
you know , with all of his &quot; yos &quot; and &quot; bros . &quot;
i mean , calm down .
you &apos;re a middle @-@ aged gay man
who punctuates sentences with your hip .
finally .
i know . it feels good to admit it , you know ?
go on .
you know what else is really irritating ?
how needy he is with them .
let me in .
what up , bro ?
do you seriously not know how loud you &apos;re being ?
the neighbors are complaining .
i give you guys respect , and you give me nothing .
i mean , we -- we --
got you !
what ?
you should have seen your faces .
you were like , &quot; what ?
w @-@ we -- we really are j @-@ just so sorry ! &quot;
you got us .
that was a good one , bro .
you got to do shots with us .
okay .
munch , get the jaeger .
yeah , should we serve the potion in cups of dixie ?
or the -- - just get it , dude .
yeah .
i just had the sickest idea .
caminal should join our mission .
who &apos;s caminal ? am i -- am i caminal ?
you want -- you want me to go on a mission ?
of course ! you &apos;re auto @-@ bid , dog .
okay , what is this mission ?
this first .
presenting lord and lady jaeger .
does this smell the way it &apos;s supposed to smell , or ...
we were low , and i had to mix .
presenting lord and lady jaeger @-@ cuervo @-@ weiser .
cam ! cam ! cam !
so , that &apos;s just the rough idea .
if you want to see more sketches ,
just check out my closetcloud account .
um , look , i know i &apos;m just a suit in this company ,
but i &apos;ve got to say , i &apos;m a little underwhelmed .
i love it .
by the reaction from the rest of you suits .
come on , we &apos;re a family . right ?
so , honey , are we all set for our pitch with george ross
this afternoon ?
yes , sir .
what did i tell you about &quot; honey &quot;
sorry .
at the office ?
okay , so , if there &apos;s nothing else --
actually , um , if -- if you don &apos;t mind ,
i &apos;d like to show you some designs of my own .
so , corporate is pitching creative ideas now ?
i know i don &apos;t look like
i just rode to work on my skateboard .
snap . look at you .
but for people who are paid to think outside the box ,
you people are pretty inside the box
when it comes to the box we call the mighty closet .
lights .
so i guess we &apos;re doing this .
i like to call this model the ambassador .
after the success of our royal renaissance series ,
i thought , &quot; why not brushed brass for the valet rods ? &quot;
been done . lights .
what ? i &apos;m , i &apos;m sorry .
we tried it five years ago . it didn &apos;t work .
silk shirts slip off the brass .
okay . well , i &apos;m just getting started .
lights .
this model features a hidden tilt @-@ out hamper .
that &apos;s a terrific idea .
i &apos;m glad you think so .
is what ken sutton &apos;s boss told him
when he pitched it in 1992 .
lights .
you &apos;ve got to know your history .
honestly .
so , it &apos;s --
it &apos;s originality you &apos;re looking for .
you &apos;re not seriously coming in here ,
pitching me the tennessee slider .
is that the best you &apos;ve got ?
okay , i think we &apos;re done here .
hey , mom .
oh , hi , manny .
how did it go with your coffee girl ?
really great , actually . yeah , i--
you &apos;re lying .
how could you tell ?
i couldn &apos;t . you just confessed .
i got up to the counter and panicked .
i bought two christmas cds ,
a muffin i didn &apos;t need , then left .
manny , please just talk to her .
she &apos;s like everybody else . what &apos;s wrong with you ?
mom , i &apos;m not you .
when i walk into a room , everyone &apos;s head doesn &apos;t turn .
people don &apos;t laugh extra hard at my jokes .
the world is different for people like you .
manny , but you --
i don &apos;t , really don &apos;t want to talk about it anymore .
you better hurry . you &apos;re gonna miss your chance .
okay , stay right here .
i &apos;ll be right back .
mariela ! mariela morales !
si ?
hola !
ma @-@ mariel--
ay , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
m @-@ mariel ...
somebody order six large pizzas ?
hey , uh , somebody pay the pizza guy .
can i help you ?
uh , yeah . we &apos;re here for the party .
we should be on the list .
aw , yeah , my bad .
yeah , see , for a second , i thought you guys
were just a couple illinois douches
who thought that i &apos;d be dumb enough
just to let you walk in --
what the hell ? !
go !
go , go !
meet at the rendezvous !
so , this is the post office ,
cause where else are they gonna get their &quot; bills &quot; ?
of course , you got to waddle past this guy
to get to the nail salon .
and word on the street is they &apos;re putting in a crossfit next door .
why are these two eggs sticky ?
because the neighbor &apos;s dog is a real slobberer ,
but lucky , he &apos;s not very fast .
my teacher says that there &apos;s no such thing as weird ,
just different .
that &apos;s a lovely random thought .
i drew up plans for a duckingham palace ,
but i can &apos;t find them ,
so i guess we &apos;ll just have to &quot; wing &quot; it .
what the heck is that ?
oh , it &apos;s a duck call to make the ducklings feel safe .
should there be another adult present ?
no .
but there should be a kid present .
that kid is you .
you &apos;ve got your whole life to roll your eyes .
today isn &apos;t just about building a duck village .
it &apos;s about building your smile .
don &apos;t fight it .
there it is .
as you can see ,
our little duck harbor has a working lighthouse .
wait a second , what in the world did he just say ?
a working lighthouse ? yes , it is working .
pretty cool , huh ?
easy , easy , lily .
forget everything you &apos;ve ever heard about eggs .
they &apos;re actually quite delicate .
you &apos;ve got to be very care-- son of a -- aah !
oh , no !
hot !
look .
we &apos;ve got a runner !
no !
hey , good as new .
she crazy .
he makes me feel like an outsider in my own home , and ...
now that i think about it ,
ever since we started renting that upstairs apartment ...
do we want to take this detour ?
no , it &apos;s relevant . stay with me .
it &apos;s not just the frat boys . no .
he &apos;s this way with all of our guests .
cam doesn &apos;t change the sheets
as much as he changes his personality .
all right , ladies .
we got some steaming @-@ hot tea ,
some popping @-@ hot biscuits .
now , let &apos;s have a little sizzling @-@ hot gossip .
do not go in there !
don &apos;t !
do not open -- oh , my god !
no ! girl , do not go back in there !
i just think cam tries too hard .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s begging to be liked .
wait , is this a one @-@ way street ?
oh , that &apos;s a fair question .
i don &apos;t -- i guess i could make more of an effort with people .
i just --
it doesn &apos;t exactly come naturally to me .
oh , cam !
cam !
i couldn &apos;t even find anything to say to two red @-@ headed lawyers .
i &apos;m lost .
i know .
i &apos;m all over the place .
i think that i &apos;m just maybe jealous
that he can hit it off with anybody .
but i can &apos;t be mad at him for being likable .
i mean , that &apos;s one of the reasons i fell in love with him .
cam ?
who else would i be talking about ?
no , the pizza guy with the goat
looks like uncle cam .
okay , i feel like there &apos;s a story here .
hey , honey .
i don &apos;t want to talk about it .
okay , for the sake of our marriage ,
i &apos;m gonna assume that this is frat @-@ related .
oh , look -- the belt i got you .
okay , pull over .
cam , could you just stop for a second ?
come on , stop .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
for the past few weeks , i &apos;ve been rolling my eyes at you ,
thinking that you had this pathological need
to be liked by everyone ,
but i couldn &apos;t have been more wrong .
all right ? people are just drawn to you .
no , i do have a pathological need to be liked .
i knew it .
this is a stupid prank gone wrong ,
and i &apos;ve -- i &apos;m separated from the guys .
i wanted them to like me so much i stole a goat .
i &apos;m a rustler , mitchell .
i &apos;m a filthy rustler .
okay , well , that seems worse to you than it does to me .
i do it with all of our guests .
i change who i am
so they &apos;ll like me more .
it &apos;s exhausting .
well , then , stop .
because you &apos;re likable enough just being you .
i know .
and this insecurity is a part of me that i do not love .
caminal !
what &apos;s up , my brothers ? !
cam .
what is wrong with me ?
get in -- we got a goat to paint !
no , you know what , guys ?
this isn &apos;t right .
this is not who i am .
so i &apos;m gonna take the goat back ,
and if you were ever truly my friend , you &apos;ll understand .
you both suck !
you suck .
all right , come on .
okay , i &apos;ll -- i &apos;ll put her in back ,
and , um , don &apos;t worry -- she &apos;s really friendly .
i ain &apos;t afraid of no goats .
okay , send me the contracts .
i never could resist a pretty face .
stop it , george . i &apos;m married .
i &apos;m gonna run to the men &apos;s room .
so , everything all right ? you &apos;ve barely said a word .
well , it &apos;s not like you needed my help ,
and i think i embarrassed myself enough for one day .
look , i might have been too hard on you before .
i &apos;m just tired of everyone
always pitching me their closet ideas .
if i had a nickel for every time someone came to me
with &quot; the next great closet , &quot;
i &apos;d have a pegasus series split @-@ level walk @-@ in full of nickels .
but , dad , i &apos;m in the biz .
i should have known that those are old design ideas .
no one nails it on the first try .
hell , i once pitched a clamshell shoe container
with a living hinge .
no .
i was young .
keep with it .
you &apos;ll get there eventually .
thanks .
we all set ?
let me settle up .
thanks , dad .
pretty exciting lunch , huh ?
the same caesar salad ,
the same closets i order every year .
yeah , but you &apos;re happy with them , right ?
they &apos;re closets .
i @-@ if you &apos;re ever looking to expand your horizons a little ,
i have some design ideas that are fresh of the drawing board .
i &apos;m sorry . oh , gosh .
that &apos;s my husband &apos;s birdseed .
i &apos;d love to give you a look @-@ see here .
i &apos;ll take care of this .
heavens .
&quot; duckingham palace &quot; ?
oh , no , no . no , no , sorry .
those are the wrong ones .
um , wrong plans .
i &apos;ve got other ones , and they &apos;re -- they &apos;re super .
oh , gosh .
oh , my god . what -- it &apos;s -- it &apos;s on my head , right ?
it &apos;s on my head . okay .
god . okay . i know it &apos;s in here . it &apos;s in here .
oh , my god .
okay . okay .
oh , it &apos;s in my shirt .
i was gone for 30 seconds .
dad , dad !
well , that was forever .
i &apos;m so embarrassed .
i &apos;ve never freaked out like that .
how bad was it ?
i mean ...
i &apos;m so sorry that i gave you such a hard time
about not talking to chelsea .
actually , you kind of helped me out .
how ?
seeing you fall apart like that ...
stutter , twitch , and babble --
okay , bloop @-@ bloop .
you &apos;re the most confident woman in the world ,
and if someone like you can be human ,
then i don &apos;t have to feel bad about chickening out with girls .
you know who else is human ? chelsea .
so why do you feel so intimidated by her ?
go . go over there .
there &apos;s no time .
she gets off at 5 : 00 on saturday
so that she can pick up her dry cleaning
and make 6 : 00 yoga .
stalker .
call her .
really ?
yes . you can do it .
okay .
hi , chelsea ?
i was in earlier , wearing the green jacket
that &apos;s louder than that guy laughing at his own screenplay ?
she &apos;s laughing !
i would like to take you out for coffee sometime ,
maybe at a place you don &apos;t have to make it ?
great . o @-@ okay , i &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
bye .
she said yes .
of course she did .
i &apos;m so proud of you .
you see , that &apos;s what it is to be a confident person .
and you got all of it from your mother .
mam -- ay !
ay , what &apos;s her name ? !
what size tubing would i need
for three ducklings to slide through ?
cost is no ob-- where are you going ?
to the back to check on it ? thank you so much !
well , look at you playing with rocks just like a real kid .
yep .
oh , i hope those eggs are doing okay .
i feel bad leaving them alone .
probably safer that way .
i know people think i &apos;m crazy .
it &apos;s just more fun believing even when no one else does .
anyone can be a doubter .
did i ever tell you how i got them ?
no , but i , uh ...
i found them abandoned in someone &apos;s yard , the poor things .
no mother .
no one to take care of them .
so , they &apos;re orphans ?
where did their mother go ?
i don &apos;t know .
i know i &apos;m all they have now .
hello .
hey , honey .
can i ask you a tiny little favor ?
okay .
can you rotate the eggs 90 degrees , clockwise ?
no , phil , i can &apos;t . i can &apos;t .
i am tired , and i am sweaty ,
and as much as i have tried to stay positive like you all day ,
i think sometimes we need to just face certain facts
like corporate people are not creative ,
and ducks that haven &apos;t hatched in a month might never .
just turn the eggs , lady !
you know what ?
kind of done with birds for the day .
oh , my god , phil .
i think it &apos;s hatching .
wait , what ?
are you sure ?
what -- what do i do ?
okay , uh , stay calm .
i @-@ i &apos;ll talk you through the labor .
they &apos;re coming , lily !
okay , claire -- tell me what you see !
oh , god . i think i see a beak .
well , the good news is we &apos;re not breach .
it looks like it &apos;s struggling to break through .
okay , if you are concerned about traumatizing him ,
strap on that toucan beak i wore last halloween
when we dressed as froot loops and start pecking .
i &apos;m using a fork .
steady hands , claire , please .
i &apos;ve seen you play &quot; operation . &quot;
oh , it &apos;s hatched !
it &apos;s so cute .
oh , it &apos;s so cute !
i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m missing this !
hey , buddy !
we &apos;re telling people i was there !
i think another one &apos;s hatching .
what ? ! i &apos;m sorry , lily .
speed bump in three , two ...
oh , my god , all three ? !
that &apos;s amazing !
lily , take a picture !
yep .
here .
hi , buddy .
okay , ready ?
one , two --
hold up , hold up .
he &apos;s in my shirt .
another bird in my shirt .
got it .
i &apos;m going to bed . good night , sweetie .
good night . wait . you know what ?
i was just thinking ,
if those duck eggs were still viable ...
maybe we should find out if you &apos;ve got
one or two fighters left in there , too .
no , thank you .
i &apos;m done with little ones running around the house .
stay .
oh , i said stay .
the ducks imprinted on claire .
it &apos;s n @-@ not a big deal .
come on , guys .
she said stay !
come on .
