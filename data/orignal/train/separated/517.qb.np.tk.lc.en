outlaw
you &apos;re next .
meet 20 @-@ year @-@ old jose rivera ,
night manager at a place called dee &apos;s original diner .
and then this is eddie butler .
he was 17 . he was a fry cook ,
high school senior , basketball star .
and finally renee acosta .
she was 16 years old . she was a cashier at the restaurant ,
and she was a junior in high school .
and they were all murdered last night just after closing .
the safe and the cash register were both emptied ,
and all the victims &apos; valuables were missing , too .
any surveillance video ?
no . because the system burnt down in a fire
that was set after the murders took place .
the arson was probably just a forensic countermeasure .
â€­ look at me .
the coroner has the bodies right now
and it looks like the cause of death to each
was a gunshot wound to the head .
garcia , pause !
where did this happen ?
oh , i was saving the worst for last .
mm @-@ hmm . las vegas , new mexico ?
wait , what &apos;s the deal with las vegas , new mexico ?
the same exact type of robbery @-@ homicide
took place there 6 years ago .
at that time it was at a place called the burger corral
and there were 4 victims .
teenagers . they sexually assaulted the girls ,
then shot them execution style , robbed the place ,
and then burned it down to the ground .
we consulted from here
and the ncavc coordinatorin santa fe did the groundwork .
any suspects ?
none , but we knew it was probably someone
with a personal connection to the town .
problem was it &apos;s a pretty transient place .
tourists , truckers , and
a lot of the work opportunities are seasonal .
given the level of violence , we profiled
it was two or more criminally experienced unsubs ,
most likely under the influence of some type of narcotic ,
but the never struck again and the case went cold .
looks like it &apos;s hot now .
so are these guys back
or is this somebody playing copycat ?
that &apos;s what we need to find out .
wheels up in 30 .
&quot; all sins tend to be addictive .
and the terminal point of addiction is damnation . &quot;
w.h. auden .
las vegas , new mexico , was actually founded
70 years before its nevada counterpart .
in the late 19th century , it was a booming railroad hub
with a reputation for lawlessness ,
and apparently , outlaws are a part of the town &apos;s genetics .
billy the kid lived there ,
and doc holliday himself had a saloon there
before going to meet wyatt earp in tombstone .
the more things change ,
the more things stay the same .
all the victims in both
instances were teenagers , except for jose rivera .
a younger staff , that &apos;s pretty typical for a night shift .
the unsubs might have considered that .
it would be easier to subdue a group of kids .
almost an identical m.o.
copycat or no ,
why go back to this town and do this again ?
they could be sending some
kind of message to announce their return .
or it just might be criminal ego .
they got away with it the first time . why not do it again ?
with unsubs this violent ,
how do you just disappear and go dormant for 6 years ?
they may have been in prison .
that would explain the criminal experience .
crime u. best education taxpayer money can buy .
when we land , i &apos;ll have garcia compile a list
of recently released convicts in the area .
morgan , you and reid go to the coroner when we land .
lewis , you &apos;re with dave and me at the local pd .
that was a great day .
our girls had a ball .
you didn &apos;t call me .
you don &apos;t have to come down here , you know .
word is there &apos;s a phone message .
is it true ?
brooks , there &apos;s nothing for you to do .
is it true , raul ?
yes .
it &apos;s them , isn &apos;t it ?
same ones as before .
brooks , you need to go home
and wait for me to call you with any news .
it &apos;s worse at home and you know it .
the feds are on their way .
behavioral specialists .
behavior specialists .
what the hell good &apos;s that gonna do , huh ?
they &apos;re here .
you know what ? come to think of it ,
maybe you ought to stick around .
they might want to talk with you .
agents , chief montoya at your service .
thank you for coming .
i &apos;m agent hotchner .
this is dr. lewis and agent rossi .
nice to meet you .
there &apos;s been a development .
renee acosta &apos;s parents discovered a voicemail
she left when the assailants broke in .
over here .
this is incredibly difficult ,
but anything you can tell us about that call ,
anything at all will be helpful .
the message just showed up this morning .
sometimes it does that .
i didn &apos;t even hear my phone ring .
why did she call me ?
why not the police ?
you &apos;re her mother ,
and she was frightened .
i can &apos;t believe it &apos;s been 6 years .
it feels like yesterday .
fell asleep out on the couch .
next thing i know , my wife &apos;s shaking me ,
yelling about how they killed jenny .
it all felt like a dream .
i keep hoping maybe i &apos;ll wake up one of these days .
and where is your wife now ?
went back to her family in reno about a year after it happened .
her heart was broken too bad .
but you stayed .
my daughter &apos;s buried right up the road .
i ain &apos;t goin &apos; anywhere .
i thought for sure you &apos;d have caught &apos; em last time .
i was positive .
mr. tanner , we &apos;re going to do everything
we possibly can , i promise you .
you just promise me ...
you &apos;ll catch those sons of bitches
and you &apos;re gonna make &apos; em pay .
oh , my god .
mom ... they have guns .
get down ! hey , shut your mouth !
i got someone over here .
you all right ?
yeah . yeah , just , um ...
just listening to that voicemail again .
with my work i &apos;ve never been big on the whole
compartmentalization thing .
i just feel like i can &apos;t understand others &apos; emotions
if i don &apos;t deal with my own , you know ?
the best way out is always through .
too bad it &apos;s not always the easiest way .
you &apos;re not kidding .
you hear anything else on the recording ?
yeah . you guys profiled that you thought
there might be multiple unsubs .
i can only hear two on this recording .
so , unless there are others outside ,
we &apos;re dealing with a partnership .
several antemortem wounds , facial lacerations ,
fractured jaw , a fractured skull .
yeah , it was a brutal beating .
all 3 of them had broken ribs , too .
and ligature marks .
looks like the boys were bound with their own belts
and electrical wires . i found leather
and melted plastic in their clothes .
renee acosta was different .
there &apos;s evidence of sexual assault .
any recoverable dna ?
none . whatever wasn &apos;t destroyed by the fire
got washed away by the sprinklers .
but she was recovered without clothes on .
and based on the cotton
and nylon fibers i found around her wrists ,
i think they restrained her with her own underwear .
that &apos;s precisely what happened to the female victim 6 years ago .
those details weren &apos;t released to the press .
these aren &apos;t copycats . these are the same guys .
want a bump , man ?
no , man , i &apos;m good for now .
suit yourself .
gracias , amigo . pleasure doing business with you .
oh , yes , sir .
get myself a big old hooker tonight
and have a little fun with her . ha ha .
where you goin &apos; ?
there &apos;s somebody i ain &apos;t seen in a while .
oh , you gotta be kiddin &apos; me , man .
what &apos;s a few hours ? tell her to wait . you &apos;ll miss all the fun .
no , man , i &apos;m good .
i &apos;ll meet you back here later .
oh , come on , dude .
come on , man , let me score some more crank .
cole , honey , don &apos;t just eat your chips .
i want to see you eat your sandwich . ok ?
when did you get out ?
lovely to see you , too .
you can &apos;t come in here .
i got you flowers .
you picked them from my yard .
what &apos;s the matter , huh ? you love flowers .
go , please .
where &apos;s the fire , huh ?
what , you , uh-- you ain &apos;t happy to see me ?
do i look happy to see you , duke ?
you know , i wrote you letters . i tried to call .
hell , you &apos;re-- you are the only reason
i came back to this damn place .
hey ! you shouldn &apos;t have bothered .
not a day went by that i didn &apos;t think about you .
you saying you didn &apos;t miss me ? even a little ?
not a bit .
mommy , who are you talking to ?
nobody , baby . go on and finish your lunch .
mommy ? you got a kid ?
get out of here , duke . i &apos;m serious .
wait a minute .
how old is he ?
don &apos;t ever come back .
hey , kid ! how old are you ?
cole , i said go into the living room !
what is he , about 5 ?
i have a shotgun in here .
you know i &apos;ll use it .
he &apos;s mine .
goodbye .
tam , is that my son ? !
is that my son ? !
get out of here !
i &apos;m gonna call the cops !
6 years ago the unsubs separated the victims by gender .
the bodies of the boys were found out by the register ,
the two girls were found in the back office .
yeah , we profiled that was about control .
isolate the males who were more of a threat .
exactly . they even blindfolded them .
but they didn &apos;t do that this time .
no blindfolds , and the 3 victims
were found in the same area ,
all within a few feet of each other .
dee &apos;s original diner had a back office .
why didn &apos;t they use it ?
and look at the body position .
the victims from 6 years ago were prone ,
like they were shot while kneeling .
but jose rivera and eddie butler were both sitting up .
maybe they posed them that way .
i don &apos;t think so . ballistics suggest
they were seated when they were shot ,
and look at the way they &apos;re facing .
it &apos;s like they wanted them to see each other .
not see . watch .
you think they made the boys watch the sexual assault ?
well , if they did , they probably made her watch the murders .
psychological sadism .
a ritual aspect . that &apos;s new .
and very specific . why didn &apos;t they do this before ?
well , they could be evolving .
or it &apos;s possible only one of them
was involved 6 years ago .
which would mean he has a new partner .
it &apos;s slow .
we ought to knock off early .
spoke too soon .
hi , how can i--
evenin &apos; , folks .
i &apos;m gonna need you to fill a prescription .
all right , ladies and gentlemen ,
we &apos;re gonna have a little fun now .
you come with me . come on .
let go of her . let go .
randy mcadams , his niece jane .
my wife &apos;s friends with her mother .
the press is outside . do you want us to handle this ?
no , i &apos;ll--i &apos;ll do it .
he &apos;s looking for methamphetamine hydrochloride .
he cleaned out the cash register , too .
there was only one of them . where &apos;s the partner ?
that &apos;s a huge risk to stay in town and pull this so soon .
they &apos;re meth addicts , though .
the risk may be of little consequence .
6 years ago they up and disappeared .
this one doesn &apos;t seem like part of their playbook .
my money says it &apos;s the new guy .
well , he was smart enough to hide his face
and he didn &apos;t burn the place down .
we still have to wait for the autopsy , but ,
she &apos;s fully clothed .
doesn &apos;t look like there was sexual assault either .
but he still made them watch . look .
he positions them so they &apos;re facing each other .
that aspect is important to him , almost compulsive .
you think he &apos;s ok ?
no . i don &apos;t .
his job is to keep this community safe ,
and now he feels responsible .
you missed your brother .
where you been ?
i was out like i told you , man .
i want a beer . you want a beer ?
you go and do something stupid , lester ?
no beer , man ? this place is a dump .
all them sirens i been hearin &apos; out there ,
they better not be because of you .
relax , man . cops got no idea it was me .
i rode by a bunch of them on the way back over here .
what the hell did you do , man ?
i scored us some primo pharmacy grade .
that &apos;s what .
damn it , les , we &apos;re supposed to--
hey , what about , &quot; thank you , les .
that was very thoughtful of you , les . &quot;
no problem , man . don &apos;t sweat it .
how about we were supposed to be layin &apos; low , les . how about--
who the hell died and made you the boss , man ?
as i remember , you were out making a booty call .
hey ! she ain &apos;t got nothin &apos; to do with this .
the hell she don &apos;t .
what am i supposed to do , sit around and wait
until you get your rocks off , man ?
get the pills . we gotta go .
i ain &apos;t done talkin &apos; about this .
well , i am .
hey , kid , you got something good for me ?
i am happy to report that
i have finished my nationwide vicap search
of criminals who like to make their victims watch them
commit violent crimes . i &apos;m sad to tell you
it is an appallingly populated genre . i got a whole lot of bad boys
and it &apos;s not even saturday night .
well , narrow it down by surrounding states .
the unsubs are probably from somewhere in the region .
and eliminate anybody over the age of 45 .
these crimes are impulsive and violent .
they &apos;re probably not that old .
copy you .
that brings us down to 4 .
ooh . wait . rewind .
actually two . &apos; cause two of those guys have died .
what &apos;s that leave us ?
uh , first up is 41 @-@ year @-@ old glen capshaw
from yuma , arizona .
he made his 9 @-@ year @-@ old son watch him beat up a bully &apos;s father .
apparently made the 10 @-@ year @-@ old bully watch , too .
which is mean , but weirdly fair , maybe ?
he doesn &apos;t fit our profile . who else ?
ok , next up is 26 @-@ year @-@ old lester turner
from lubbock , texas .
when he was 16 , he raped a 15 @-@ year @-@ old girl ,
made her 12 @-@ year @-@ old brother watch .
beat up the brother really bad , too .
well , that would explain the ritual aspect .
what else you got on this guy ?
uh , he served 9 years , two of them in juvie ,
the rest of them at texas state prison ,
which is owned by the citadel corrections company .
he was released last year .
so he was actually locked up
during the burger corral incident .
they may have met in prison . he could be his new partner .
garcia , give me everything you &apos;ve got on turner--
known associates , cell mates , the whole nine .
on it . stand by , sugar love .
a town this small , these guys have gotta be feeling the heat .
they &apos;ll be on the move soon .
hey . what you got cookin &apos; , baby girl ?
besides the fact that i &apos;m all hopped up
on dark roast and espresso beans ?
i have intel to share . &apos; tis why i have called thee .
deep background search into lester turner
brought me down into a wicked place .
turned out he shared a cell block with a benjamin wade
and a william duke mason .
what &apos;s so--
you know better than to interrupt me when i &apos;m all &apos; fiened out .
you &apos;re gonna ask me what is so sinisterly special
about wade and mason , and i &apos;m going to tell you .
they were messed up bikers , who , 5 years ago
were arrested in el paso for an armed robbery at a gas station
where the clerk was killed .
it turns out they tried to torch the place ,
but the cops came and caught them .
all right , can you send--
stop it .
check your tablets . it &apos;s already there .
can i ask a question now ?
definitely not , because that &apos;s not the kicker .
get this . before he dropped out of high school and ran away ,
william duke mason spent his junior year in what new mexico town ?
yes , you may talk now .
las vegas .
precisely ! see , mason &apos;s name was on that list of ex @-@ cons ,
but it wasn &apos;t flagged because he &apos;s actually from dallas ,
and high school records
weren &apos;t part of my search parameters , you guys .
garcia , where are wade and mason now ?
oh , i can tell you that definitely .
wade is still in prison because he was the shooter in that robbery ,
but mason was paroled last month .
lewis and i will fly to texas and talk to wade .
let &apos;s put out an apb on turner and mason .
william duke mason &apos;s mother violet moved here from dallas
after she married a rancher named jeff koldyke ,
who worked for the romero property for a short time .
don &apos;t remember any of them .
it &apos;s not surprising you don &apos;t remember mason .
as a teenager , he would have been withdrawn .
especially because we think he hated it here .
he was already fatherless ,
and then he was uprooted and dragged to a new place
where he had no friends .
as a teenager , that can be traumatic and may somehow
be a source of animosity towards the town itself .
who &apos;s that guy ?
his name is ben wade .
we actually have reason to believe that
he was involved in the burger corral murder 6 years ago .
5 years go , wade and mason were arrested in texas .
so we know they were partners back then .
then in prison they met lester turner .
turner gets released and a few months later mason gets out .
a partnership is born .
a lot of criminal ego in play .
so we think they may have come back here
in order to emulate the
success they had with their old partnership .
they &apos;re methamphetamine users , so it &apos;s likely
the limbic systems in their brains have been damaged .
this is disconcerting , because it can dramatically alter behavior
and give rise to a series of psychopathic tendencies
and eventually turn into full @-@ blown psychosis .
the dynamic between turner and mason is rare ,
like two alpha males co @-@ existing .
i &apos;m running low !
they must have some kind of respect
and / or fear thing that &apos;s keeping them together .
but it &apos;s a tenuous bond .
a rift will grow between these two
if it hasn &apos;t already . in fact , we &apos;re counting on it .
hopefully , they &apos;ll make a mistake .
thank you .
all right . let &apos;s get to it .
definitely .
damn it .
excuse me .
how &apos;s the coffee around here ?
it ain &apos;t starbucks .
well , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
me , i &apos;m italian . i like it strong .
how about you ?
hot and fresh .
really ?
&apos;cause i , uh , kind of pegged you
as a single malt kind of guy .
look , chief ,
we both know that if your judgment is compromised ,
it doesn &apos;t do us any good . in fact , quite the opposite .
the last thing your town needs
is for its chief of police to be caught drinking on the job .
now , i know you &apos;ve buried a lot of good people ,
people you &apos;re supposed to protect .
but the ones who are still here need you now more than ever .
so ...
why don &apos;t you go home ,
drink some real coffee , and dry out .
you come back fresh ,
you can help us catch these guys .
you sure are some kind of tall drink of water , ain &apos;t ya ?
i usually don &apos;t even like your kind .
shut up .
we want to ask you about your partner , william duke mason
and this man , lester turner .
6 years ago a restaurant in las vegas , new mexico , was robbed .
there &apos;s another vegas ?
hey , they got gambling and hookers out there , too ?
the entire staff was killed
and the restaurant was burned to the ground .
not before they raped the girls , though .
they were teenagers , all 4 of them .
well , ain &apos;t that just tragic .
we know it was you , ben .
oh , no . y &apos;all can &apos;t prove that .
not yet . as soon as we do ,
we &apos;ll make sure you &apos;re
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law .
and what that means is after you finish
serving out your remaining 20 years here ,
you &apos;ll be transferred to new mexico .
now , the good news is they &apos;ve outlawed the death penalty ,
but the bad news is , it &apos;s gonna be a slow death in a cage .
but we may be able to convince the court to be lenient
if you cooperate with us .
must have made you mad , losing your partner like that .
stuck in here all by yourself .
the two of them out there , together ,
raising the kind of hell you can only dream about .
but you can help us catch the men .
maybe knock a couple years off your sentence while you &apos;re at it .
who knows ? maybe you &apos;ll get a chance to ride a harley again
before you need a walker .
all right . what do y &apos;all want to know ?
we want to know about their relationship .
thick as thieves , both of them .
kind of weird , too , &apos; cause lester &apos;s stone cold crazy .
but he &apos;s a loyal little son of a bitch .
how so ?
well , one day duke knocked out
this big @-@ ass mexican was trying to shank lester .
ever since then , they was inseparable .
they &apos;d tweak together , share food , cigarettes .
i &apos;d always hear them talk about how they was gonna
open up a motorcycle shop someday .
tell you the truth , i think lester &apos;s
a little sweet on him , if you know what i mean .
and what &apos;s so stone cold crazy about him ?
well , i &apos;ll put it this way , darlin &apos; ,
if you happen to find him , you ain &apos;t takin &apos; him alive .
and he sure as hell isn &apos;t gonna let you hurt his boy duke .
hi , chief .
i &apos;ll take these , and i &apos;m gonna need a fill @-@ up on 1 and 3 .
ok .
saw you on the news , mister .
ok , calm down , amigo .
i &apos;m callin &apos; the cops .
it &apos;s ok . you don &apos;t want to do this , man .
afternoon , sir .
can &apos;t say i appreciate you pullin &apos; that gun on my friend .
whoo ! lord have mercy !
clean out the register . i got the cameras .
get lighter fluid so we can torch this place .
no time . the cops know who we are .
gotta keep movin &apos; .
ah , here we go .
i no , no , no , no , senor , por favor , no , por favor !
no , senor , senor , suplico ...
por favor .
thank you so much . thank you , man ,
you &apos;ve been so helpful . can i get a high five ?
all the surveillance has been destroyed .
what &apos;d the father say ?
there were two of them . both on motorcycles ,
both matching the descriptions of turne and mason .
they let them live . i wonder why .
they said the one with the short hair
just stood there pointing his weapon
but never pulled the trigger .
that must have been mason .
apparently the other one wanted to shoot them ,
mason wouldn &apos;t let him , they had a brief argument
and then fled . but here &apos;s the thing--
they &apos;ve never left a survivor before .
i think something between them must have changed .
if they were arguing ,
it could mean the partnership &apos;s dissolving ,
exactly like we thought .
these guys are headed south , maybe mexico .
we should alert border patrol .
we should keep moving .
we &apos;ve been moving , man .
what the hell was that back there ?
i told you , i ain &apos;t killin &apos; kids .
that &apos;s wasn &apos;t a kid , man .
that was a witness .
he wasn &apos;t more than 6 years old .
what about his daddy , huh ?
no .
why not ?
because a boy needs his father .
ohh . so now you got a conscience .
ain &apos;t that something .
got any other new developments you want to let me in on ?
â€­ yeah .
yeah , i think it &apos;s about time we split up .
split up ?
are you serious ?
just got different priorities now .
what the hell happened to mexico , and the bike shop , man ?
cervezas and senoritas .
things change , brother .
we &apos;ve been talking about this for years ,
and now you &apos;re just gonna bail on me for some bitch ?
don &apos;t call her that .
that &apos;s the mother of my son .
so now what , you just gonna run off and live happily ever after
like some fairy tale ?
you &apos;re a grade @-@ a fugitive , my man .
that may prove difficult .
well , i ain &apos;t running out on my kid
so he can go drag him from town to town .
how do you know he &apos;s yours ?
he &apos;s mine .
yeah ? your ass has been locked up .
that whore could &apos;ve banged any cowboy or ...
watch your mouth .
that bitch could &apos;ve wrapped her
legs around just about anybody .
oh , you &apos;re an idiot , man .
you go back there , it &apos;s gonna be crawling with cops .
oh , come on !
duke !
agents .
chief , you &apos;re back .
i made some phone calls .
one of my guys knows a girl who went to high school
with duke mason .
she said he used to date a girl named tammy vasquez .
even after they graduated , i guess he still would come around .
anyway , the rumor is he got her pregnant .
is she still here ?
she sure is . lives just outside of town .
ready and willing . what can i do you for ?
garcia , tell me everything you can about a tammy vasquez .
she &apos;s from here in las vegas .
tammy may vasquez .
she is a waitress at the spic and span diner in new mexico .
she has a 5 @-@ year @-@ old son named cole . he &apos;s a cutie .
so she must have gotten
pregnant right around that first set of murders .
what can you tell us about cole &apos;s father ?
absolutely nothing .
it says father unknown on the birth certificate .
what if tammy is the reason mason came back ?
send us an address , penelope .
we should talk to her .
sent .
i can get you up there quick
if you don &apos;t mind an escort .
yeah . we should tell hotch .
agent rossi .
i , uh , i thought about what you said
and did what you suggested .
had some real coffee .
i &apos;m good to go .
you sure about that ?
you have my word .
here comes the t @-@ rex ...
i &apos;m gonna have a sleep .
you &apos;re gonna have a sleep ? how you gonna make him sleep ?
with a sleep pistol .
a sleep pistol ? i &apos;m gonna break it all down here .
hey , tam .
hi , mommy .
hey . what &apos;s this guy &apos;s name right here ?
he &apos;s a triceratops .
a triceratops .
i &apos;m sorry .
isn &apos;t that cool ?
cole , baby , come here . come to mama .
oh , wait a minute .
hey , wait a minute . wait a minute , now .
tam , come on .
i &apos;m calling the cops .
tam ! tam .
now , we &apos;re playing here .
can &apos;t you see that ?
why don &apos;t you come in here and sit on down a minute .
there you go . look at us .
one big happy family just playing dinosaurs and legos .
i &apos;m gonna make it up to you , tam .
i swear it .
cole , which is the toughest dinosaur ?
a t @-@ rex .
a t @-@ rex ! that &apos;s right !
rrrrr ! oh , i &apos;m gonna eat this guy !
i &apos;m gonna tear his meat right off his back .
ms. vasquez ! police !
hello ?
anybody home ?
nobody here .
wait a minute .
you hear that ?
fbi ! anybody here ?
there &apos;s somebody in there .
go around .
guys .
it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok , i got you .
i got you .
are you hurt ?
no . i &apos;m fine .
he took them . he took them both .
we need to issue an amber alert .
the harley was reported stolen
in odessa , texas , 3 weeks ago .
she said mason was by himself .
what happened to turner ?
i bet it got pretty ugly when they split up .
hotch is out coordinating roadblocks
and canvassing the area ,
but so far nothing .
why switch directions ard risk
coming all the way back here ?
he &apos;s strung out and believes that boy cole is his son .
he &apos;s capable of anything .
we should extend the amber alert .
agents ! tammy vasquez &apos; pickup truck was spotted
heading south on route 34 .
is that far from here ?
about 10 miles or so . state police have major roadways
on the other end blocked off so he can &apos;t get out ,
but it cuts through the santa fe national forest .
if he knows what he &apos;s doing ,
he can hole up out there for weeks .
where would he go to access fresh water ?
there &apos;s an old abandoned campground .
it doesn &apos;t get used much .
sometimes the kids go up there to drink .
he &apos;d want to go someplace familiar .
agents , if you don &apos;t mind me making a suggestion ...
