cece , i grew up on the mean streets
of long island , just gazing up at the manhattan city skyline ,
thinking , &quot; you know what , one day , i &apos;m gonna get there . &quot;
that first @-@ class lounge is my manhattan .
&quot; greatest discovery of all time
&quot; is that a person can change his future
by merely changing his attitude . &quot;
oprah winfrey .
sir , may i help you ? are you a member ?
i just had an incredible layover .
flew in from istanbul . i just need to lay down for a while .
i &apos;m a little ... okay ?

a first @-@ class ticket or a membership card ?
do i have a ... a membership card ?
let me ask you something . i tend to , uh ...
tend to deal with , uh ,
sarah beth .
i &apos;m not aware of a sarah beth , sir .
the last time i talked to her ,
she was suffering from the diabetes .
is she still on the inhaler ?
uh ... did she pass ?
she passed , didn &apos;t she ?
i &apos;m afraid i ...

oh , no , no , no , no .
oh , no , no , no , no .
what ?
this is where ryan lives .
whoa ! what ?
it &apos;s a gorgeous mansion .
he said it was casual .

like ... like &quot; we own england &quot; ?
that &apos;s some mcduck money !
that &apos;s &quot; do whatever i want &quot; money .
exactly .
you better learn how to ride a polo horse .
it &apos;s actually a polio horse .
uh , originally they were bred as helper horses
for people with polio , but i don &apos;t think anything
of what i just said was correct , so ...
what is ... ? are you all right ?
hey . my flight &apos;s delayed .
might not even meet his very rich family .
anyway , you guys should go to your @-@ your gate .
get out of here , you christmas ... packages .
all right . merry christmas .

in case i don &apos;t like it .
thank you .
looks like somebody &apos;s not so merry .
come on .
are you ... ?
okay , um ... that &apos;s silly .
i really want this to be true .
what seems to be troubling you ?
i just found out that my boyfriend is ... is really rich ,
and there &apos;s no way his parents are gonna like me ,
and he &apos;s ... well , have you ever
thought that the world is just full of sloths ,
and then one day , this beautiful lion walks in ?
actually , you &apos;ve probably never thought that way , santa .
can i just go ahead and call you santa ?
anyway , should i just bail on this trip ?
hmm , sounds complicated .
yeah .
why don &apos;t you
come with me to the family bathroom ,
sit on my lap , and i &apos;ll give you
the sleigh ride you &apos;ll never forget ?
what ? santa !
north pole .

don &apos;t test me , sweetie .
i &apos;ll put your head in a trash can .
you and i are gonna drink .
wow , this place is just so amazing .
you got to feel this pillow .
look at this thing . this is the pillow
that all the other pillows want to have sex with .
nice . look at that guy .
bet he &apos;s the kind of guy who takes one bite of lobster
and just throws the rest of it in the trash .
i &apos;d love to do that-- just once .
stupid trash lobster .
he &apos;s coming over .
hello , sir .
first time in the lounge ?
what &apos;s that , now ?
come on . why would you say that ?
because of all the pillow squeezing .
i get it .
i get it . i was like you once .
where are you from ?
i &apos;m from new york .
uh , manhattan , of course .
mainly the money and museum district .
i can see the central park horses
defecating from my window .
that &apos;s funny . so can i.
robert goodwin .
all right .
schmidt .
mind if i sit ?
please , go ahead .
due to increased security ,
please have your picture id ready .
all right , here &apos;s what we got to do .
we got to convince a bunch of people not to fly ,
and then we &apos;re at the top of the list .
it &apos;s foolproof-- unless it doesn &apos;t work .
then it didn &apos;t work , so i think we got
a 50 @-@ 50 chance to do it , so let &apos;s do it .
wait .
ah , yeah , yeah .
yeah , let &apos;s go .
yeah .
what &apos;s up , boys ?
those are the guys
i was just drinking with at the bar .
are you sure you guys
can fly a plane ?
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s not a big deal .
i bet the weed will offset the booze .
ah , hey there , precious .
yeah , you &apos;re quiet now ,
but when that air pressure hits you ,
you &apos;re gonna be screaming
like a cat in the dishwasher .
and i won &apos;t stop you .
this could be it , so ...
if we all die on this plane , was it worth it ?
i say yeah , let &apos;s get to chicago .
who cares ? it &apos;s snowing there .
you gonna bite me ?
when we get on the plane , i &apos;m gonna bite you back .
breast @-@ feeding is a ...
very sensitive subject for me .

and then he sent me this text .
oh , my god .
where &apos;s anna and mr. bates ?
do you watch downton ?
yeah .
i know it &apos;s a soap opera , but i like it .
it &apos;s not even about the money .
that &apos;s big .
it &apos;s like every new piece
of information i get about him
just makes him more and more out of my league .
he &apos;ll be nice about it ,
but the moment i get there ,
everybody will know i don &apos;t belong there .
am i being dumb ?
no .
did i ever tell you about that time
i met my ex @-@ boyfriend &apos;s family over the holidays ?
i &apos;ve known you for 20 minutes .
well , it was worse than the last season of scrubs .
a teaching hospital ? come on !
people think christmas is gonna be like love actually
and &quot; god only knows &quot; is gonna play
over their happy ending , but it won &apos;t .

hide out with a pizza
and save the big issues for the new year .
