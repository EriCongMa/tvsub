ladies and gentlemen , welcome back to the coral prince
surf championship here at world famous pipeline .
how about a big hand for all of our competitors ?
on the water , some of the finest champions both past and present :
we got ty samson , greg richardson , kono kalakaua .
i miss this , kono , being out here
with the people who mean the most to me .
this is where i want to be .
i think your fans couldn &apos;t agree more .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , it &apos;s my pleasure to introduce
the man behind the brand , ian adams !
let &apos;s give &apos; em a show .
go , ian !
ian !
ian !
got him . go , go , go !
ladies and gentlemen , please give the lifeguards some room .
ian ! ian !
he &apos;s been shot .
he &apos;s dead .
i want this entire beach on lockdown .
nobody leaves until we give the order , okay ?
thank you .
this place is crazy . all these people--
you &apos;d think it was the super bowl .
it &apos;s hawaii .
the coral prince championship is our super bowl .
grace keeps asking me for surfing lessons .
i told her , &quot; no chance . &quot;
you got something against surfing now ?
i don &apos;t have anything against surfing .
i have something against sharks , skin cancer ,
anything involving my daughter wearing a bikini .
hey ,
it &apos;s confirmed .
victim &apos;s ian adams .
he &apos;s the ceo of coral prince ,
biggest surf brand in the world .
he was riding a wave and he took a shot to the chest .
so far , nobody &apos;s seen or heard where the shot came from .
it should be easy . come on .
it &apos;s a nationally televised event , right ?
we got cameras on it , something panning the crowd .
all the cameras were pointed to the water
for the competition .
we &apos;re interviewing the other surfers
in case ian wasn &apos;t the target .
wait a minute .
did you catch the surf report this morning ?
can i ask you what that has to do with anything ?
just wait .
yeah , five to eight , swells from the west , light trades .
that would put the peak about 50 yards out , right ?
moving target , hit center mass .
come on . that &apos;s no lucky shot .
trained sharpshooter , you &apos;re thinking .
maybe . but whoever did the shooting ,
ian was definitely the mark .
this is gonna be hard on kono .
why &apos;s that ?
she know the vic ?
yeah . ian signed kono to a coral prince contract
when she was about 15 .
he was really like a second father to her .
she was actually riding for the team
when she blew out her knee .
but instead of dumping her after that ,
ian covered everything :
surgery , rehab , all of it ,
even though he knew that she was never gonna compete again .
you okay ?
yeah , i want to go to the coral prince house ,
talk to the team , get statements .
kono , we can cover this one for you .
no , i want this one .
i hate it when rich people get killed .
why ?
they got something that everybody wants .
yeah , money .
which means plenty of suspects .
next time , try flip @-@ flops , brah .
i &apos;m gonna pretend you didn &apos;t just say that .
hey , chin , see if you can find out who &apos;s in charge .
start building a profile . get some background information .
financials-- first rule in homicide investigations .
follow the money . copy that .
so , break it down . i don &apos;t understand .
all these kids live here or what ?
the coral prince surf team
and their coaches live here october to january .
i &apos;m sorry . did you say coaches ?
yeah .
what does that mean ? what do they say ,
&quot; don &apos;t fall off the foam , toy &quot; or what ?
oh , brah , where &apos;d you eat it ?
i &apos;m sorry . what ?
the kine , brah .
i &apos;m sorry . are you speaking english ?
hey , no need for get agro .
he caught it on land , brah .
danno don &apos;t surf .
shoots .
i dare you to tell me what he just said .
i &apos;m done .
excuse me . i &apos;m investigator chin ho kelly .
linda leon . i was ian &apos;s executive assistant .
do you have his schedule last week ?
any phone logs , e @-@ mails , financial transactions ?
i can get all that for you , no problem .
what about anything out of the ordinary recently ?
stalkers , threats ?
no , nothing like that .
all ian talked about lately was this event
and getting back on his board .
okay .
did he seem nervous about today
or give you any hint that something was wrong ?
no . as a matter of fact ,
he was happier than he &apos;d been in a long time .
meant a lot to ian that you came out today , kono .
he wanted the entire coral prince team there .
why wasn &apos;t ben there ?
you &apos;d have to ask him that
as my son no longer talks to me .
i tried last year
at his mother &apos;s funeral , but he refused .
i think ian tried to reach out to him , too ,
but nothing ever came of it .
when was the last time you saw ben ?
i don &apos;t know . it &apos;s been years .
hey , kono .
oh . this is lieutenant commander steve mcgarrett .
how you doing ?
and detective danny williams .
carlton bass .
carlton and ian grew up surfing together .
yeah , while ian was selling board shorts out of his van ,
i was flipping condos in waialua .
a couple of beach bums , really .
never dreamed our businesses would take off .
what &apos;s a real estate company
doing involved in a surf contest ?
carlton owns about 30 shopping malls
that house coral prince stores .
it &apos;s been a lucrative partnership .
sir ?
sorry to interrupt , but the press would like a statement .
thanks , randall . if you &apos;ll excuse me .
one more thing before you go .
since you and ian go back ,
you got any idea why someone would want to kill him ?
look , he marketed the north shore surfing lifestyle to the masses
and he profited wildly .
a lot of people resented that .
but only one pulled the trigger .
this is the view from the cameraman down in the sand .
essentially , that &apos;s the angle
at which the spectators from the beach were watching .
look at the way he falls ;
back and to the left .
there &apos;s no way that shot came from the beach .
the bullet came from above .
one of the houses maybe .
maybe .
the m.e. said the angle of entry was about 30 degrees .
cuz , i didn &apos;t see you there .
hey , kono , listen , why don &apos;t you
sit this one out ? just take the day .
no , i &apos;m fine .
cuz , take the day .
you know i can &apos;t do that .
part of doing this job is knowing when
you &apos;re not the one to do the job .
she &apos;s good .
all right . shooter .
all right , so if the angle of entry is roughly 30 degrees ...
that puts the bullet &apos;s trajectory here .
okay , so the shot was fired
from the pupukea ridgeline above the houses .
yeah . the only problem is
there are no roads going in or out of there .
we don &apos;t need roads .
what are you doing here ?
boss told you to beat it , huh ?
look , i really don &apos;t want to see that face he makes
when we don &apos;t do what he tells us to do .
i call it his &quot; constipated look . &quot;
i know .
hey , you cannot blame yourself , okay ?
okay .
i just felt helpless out there .
i know . cops are supposed to come in and save the day ,
but sometimes we just can &apos;t .
did you ever have a teacher that turned you around ?
someone that made you look at everything in whole new way ?
yeah , actually .
mrs. stojak ,
my sixth @-@ grade history teacher .
till i met her , i thought
that the cold war was fought in alaska .
well , ian was my mrs. stojak ,
and surfing was more than just a sport to him .
it was ... it was earth and the sun
and the sky and the water and the heart .
it was everything .
and he passed that on to his surfers ,
and it made up better people .
i need to pay him back for that ,
and i can &apos;t do that sitting here .
i understand .
what do you think ?
the shot took some skill .
you know , guys who grew up hunting boar around here
could make that shot .
yeah , also factor in
all the qualified military personnel on the island .
then we &apos;re looking at a suspect pool of ,
oh , only a couple thousand guys .
all right , so the bullet &apos;s trajectory puts our shooter
somewhere along this ridge line .
hopefully , he left something behind .
i &apos;ll start at the northern edge of the trajectory zone
and work my way towards you .
good .
excuse me .
the guy at giovanni &apos;s said ben bass was down here .
have you seen him ?
i don &apos;t know . have you ?
ben ?
kono .
where &apos;s your hair ?
where &apos;s your retainer ?
fair enough .
well , look at you , mr. environmentalist .
so you work for ocean protectors ?
yeah . yeah .
how you been , kono ?
well , i &apos;m a cop .
of course . family business .
so are you here as a cop ?
and as a friend .
i want to talk to you about ian .
yeah . i &apos;m sorry .
look , you and ian were close .
do you know of anyone that would have wanted to hurt him ?
we were close a long time ago .
before the money .
once he became the same greedy beast as my father ,
well , we didn &apos;t have much in common .
you sound pretty angry with him .
disappointed .
were there a lot of people disappointed in him ?
yeah .
but whether that got him killed--
i don &apos;t know .
i couldn &apos;t stand to be around him anymore .
is that why you weren &apos;t at the coral prince house today ?
that &apos;s not my scene anymore , kono .
besides , my dad was there , and that &apos;s ...
well ...
i don &apos;t know , when i heard about ian ,
i wanted to remember him in my own way , you know ?
so i came out here .
whoever killed ian adams
definitely came prepared .
i got indentations from the shooter &apos;s body .
powder burns and scorch marks on the grass from the muzzle flash
and i just bagged a seven mill .
nice .
you get anything ?
yeah . something you should see .
this whole area is a hunting ground .
it &apos;s crawling with wild boar .
by the looks of things , someone bled one out here
pretty recently .
mm @-@ hmm .
whoever it was ,
decided to tag his turf .
this is kapu hunting area .
so , uh , who are the kapu ?
part lifeguard , part unoffcial security force
for the north shore .
kind of like protectors for the island .
protecting the island from who ?
oh , the haoles . i get it .
protection from the haoles . sorry .
they look after the north shore and the hawaiian way of life .
what does that mean ?
so they &apos;re out there giving speeding tickets
for surfing too fast ? huh ?
they &apos;re making sure all the radio stations
are playing don ho records ?
you make them sound like the hawaiian boys scouts .
yeah , boy scouts that will beat you to a pulp
if you disrespect their land .
you &apos;re looking at every member of the kapu .
well , you got them all committed to memory .
it &apos;s a pretty exclusive club . they &apos;re all very proud .
no one hides affiliation .
in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , the kapu were heavy into
cocaine sales and trafficking .
but once surfing became big business , they went legit .
started helping brands like coral prince
establish a footing on the north shore .
all right , do me a favor .
narrow these guys down to the ones who have criminal records ,
and see if any of them have any ties to ian adams .
hello , levi parker and diego stone .
multiple weapons charges , felony b &amp; e.
looks like they just graduated from halawa correctional
on a assault charge .
look at this .
during the trial the prosecution &apos;s key witness--
ian adams .
which means they &apos;ve got motive .
congratulations .
levi , diego , you &apos;re going back to jail .
can i just ask you what we &apos;re doing here ?
i swear to god , danny ,
if you ask me that again i &apos;m going to shoot you .
then shoot me .
seriously , just shoot me .
because i &apos;m not taking another step
until you explain it to me again .
i &apos;ve explained it three times .
which is an indication of how ridiculous this detour is .
it &apos;s not a detour . it &apos;s a strategic op .
it ... a strategic op ?
that &apos;s a ... you know what i like most--
is how you were able to say that with a straight face .
so what &apos;s the problem ?
the problem is levi parker and diego stone .
they are the problem .
yet we are going to the tropics bar
at hilton hawaiian village to talk the president
of a surf club .
danny .
what ?
on this island there is an easy way to do things
and a hard way .
with the kapu , talking to kawika
before we go after levi and diego is the easy way .
ah , so what &apos;s throwing somebody in a shark tank
and then hanging another guy off a roof ?
those guys were from out of town .
you &apos;re a sick person , you know that .
in the best possible way , though , right ?
no , no , not in the best possible way .
in a very terrible way .
it is not a compliment , you understand ?
we loved ian .
half of the club is employed by coral prince
as store clerks , team managers ,
warehouse guys .
what is that ?
it &apos;s called a blue hawaii .
you have a problem with that ?
no , no , no . i &apos;d like one actually .
i just got to get with no alcohol &apos; cause we &apos;re on duty .
they call that a virgin ?
i call it not getting fired .
excuse me , two more . thank you .
kawika , listen , we need your help .
the shot that took out ian came from pupukea .
that &apos;s kapu turf .
two of your boys are suspects .
levi and diego .
levi and diego are no longer kapu .
why is that ?
they became too violent and were let go .
okay . do you know where we could find them ?
of course .
good .
feel free to share that information with us any time .
give me one good reason why i should cooperate with you , haole ?
okay . you said you loved ian .
and here &apos;s an opportunity for you
to help us catch his killers .
okay , maybe you just liked him a little bit , i don &apos;t know .
watch yourself , haole .
there it is again-- the &quot; h &quot; word .
you know , it &apos;s detective williams
or danny ...
i got other words ,
but they all mean don &apos;t tell me what to do on my island .
this is my island , too , kawika .
is that right ?
that &apos;s right .
my father and my mother are both buried here .
and my grandfather died on december 7 , 1941,
defending the same land you want to protect .
we may go at it different ways ,
but we got the same endgame , brah ,
so help us .
otherwise we &apos;ll just find these guys ourselves
and then i &apos;ll come back here and i &apos;ll arrest your ass
for obruction of justice .
i came here today out of respect , kawika .
if you want to do things a different way , i &apos;m game .
your grandfather died at pearl harbor ?
he went down with the arizona .
he &apos;s still entombed there .
then consider this a favor for him , for his sacrifice .
i &apos;ll bring levi and diego to you .
you got my word .
okay . thank you very much .
you want me to pay ?
haole , you took eight islands from us .
the least you could do is pick up the tab every now and then .
the least you could do .
when is the last time you talked to ian ?
he stopped by here a couple nights ago .
really ? why ?
i asked him the same thing .
said he wanted us to be friends again .
that he &apos;d changed .
what did you say ?
i told him to put his money where his mouth was .
then i &apos;d believe him .
ben &apos;s got a girlfriend .
howzit .
so you live here ?
on the beach ?
over a year now .
i drive by this place so many times .
i &apos;ve never stopped .
most people speed past it .
they think we &apos;re a bunch of homeless meth addicts .
couldn &apos;t be farther from the truth .
ben @-@ bo , i made this for you .
thank you , kaila .
you know i love these bracelets , right ?
since my friend kono is visiting , do you think
maybe we could give this one to her ?
sure .
mahalo , kaila .
you have pretty hair .
so do you .
kaila &apos;s mom runs a clothing store on waikiki .
that guy-- he works at the bank of hawaii .
most of these people have got jobs and cars and families .
it costs millions of dollars to buy a house here .
so instead of moving off the land of their ancestors ,
they choose to live this way .
so who owns the land , the state ?
mm @-@ hmm .
neighbors are trying to get rid of us .
i can &apos;t imagine they love a tent city
in the middle of mansion @-@ ville .
there &apos;s been a lot of threats , some damage .
it &apos;s getting worse .
what can we do about it ?
we ?
i like that .
my tongue &apos;s the same color as my shirt .
you didn &apos;t have to drink it .
oh , i didn &apos;t ?
i apologize if i &apos;m not , uh ,
if i &apos;m not familiar with the rules of strategic ops .
okay , i @-@ i mean , i thought that sitting around
drinking a 24 @-@ ounce cocktail
was standard operating procedure .
well , it worked .
the kapu said they &apos;d get us levi and diego , didn &apos;t they ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t know .
all i know is i &apos;m standing here while two murder suspects
could be on a plane right now flying back to the mainland .
okay ? would you relax . just trust me , okay ?
if the kapu say they deliver , they &apos;ll deliver .
they were supposed to be here an hour ago .
so i &apos;m just curious , where are they ?
island time .
right on schedule .
mahalo .
how you guys doing ? you all right ?
couple years back , you two got pinched on an assault charge ,
and ian &apos;s testimony is what put you guys away .
so i was just thinking about it .
when you &apos;re locked up in the state penitentiary ,
got time to think about things , plot revenge .
what the hell you talking about ?
we found your hangout up on pupukea ridge .
it &apos;s crazy &apos; cause there &apos;s a ...
there &apos;s a clear view of the pipeline from there .
nah , brah .
you don &apos;t cross kawika and get away with it .
ian was protected by the kapu .
so where were you during the coral prince championship ?
with our p.o.
really ?
call him .
i &apos;m going to call him . i &apos;m gonna call him right here ,
and you &apos;re gonna sit there and watch me .
and if your parole officer doesn &apos;t vouch for you ,
we &apos;re gonna become a lot less friendly .
well , he will ; i &apos;m always cordial .
yeah , manny , this is detective danny williams .
you &apos;ll tell kawika we &apos;re cool , right ?
we never do nothing .
having a little conversation with your boys levi and diego .
you want to vouch for these guys ?
thank you very much .
they &apos;re good .
all right , get out of here .
great , back to square one .
no suspects .
you &apos;ve come a long way from your condo at diamond head
and all that coral prince swag .
yeah , the only thing i miss from that time is my mom .
i &apos;m sorry .
i wanted to come to the service ,
but i heard it was family only .
yeah , that was my dad &apos;s idea .
what happened between you two ?
we were on a boat trip , surfing bali .
coral prince owns a factory down there .
so , one day , i go with dad and ian to check it out ,
and the thing is pouring pollution into the water .
and it &apos;s built on wetlands ,
which is crucial to the eco @-@ structure .
i mean , it should be protected land .
when i said that to ian ,
you know what he said to me , kono ?
what ?
&quot; that &apos;s the cost of doing big business . &quot;
and my father agreed .
so protect hawaii and screw the rest of the world ?
exactly .
hypocrite .
i know it hurts you to hear this , kono ,
but that &apos;s what ian was .
he and my father had it all planned .
they were going to rule the world together .
i didn &apos;t want any part of it .
lived in bali for a year .
then one day , i got the call that mom was sick and i came back .
and you stayed .
this place ... kamaaina .
it &apos;s my home now .
come on , i want to show you something .
come on .
hey , you recognize those two kids ?
that was the day you won the championship .
you blew out your knee .
after that , everything changed .
but at this moment , man , life was good .
you got all the girls back then .
yeah .
except for the one i really wanted .
kaila , watch out !
get down , get down !
get out of here ! go !
hey , you okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m fine . i got a partial plate number of one of the bikes .
nice work . listen , i &apos;m gonna get hpd
to sit on that beach until we found who attacked it .
what is the point of burning place like that down ? .
i mean , those people haven &apos;t done anything .
it &apos;s got nothing to do with the people . it &apos;s all about the land .
hey . i just got off the phone with a diving buddy of mine
over at the office of conservation and coastal lands .
she told me that the lobbying got pretty heavy recently
to take that land private and zone it for commercial use .
apparently , the were number of birds on the table .
all the typical players popping up ,
but there was one holding company on the fast track .
they even had money in escrow .
shortfin international . guess who owns it .
ian adams .
okay , so wait a minute . so what if ben bass found out that ian adams
is trying to buy the land he &apos;s trying to protect ?
if i &apos;m ben bass , i &apos;m not happy .
what is it , cuz ?
ben has a rifle .
he used it to scare off the men who attacked the camp .
but there &apos;s no way he could &apos;ve ...
okay , wait a minute . if he &apos;s got motive and means ,
he is a person of interest .
all right .
danny and i will go and talk to ben
and run that rifle through ballistics .
no . let me .
if ben is a suspect , i need to be the one to tell him .
all right .
chin , look into this land deal , okay ?
see if you can find out who else knew about it .
and you can start with ian adams &apos; executive assistant .
so coral prince put a multimillion dollar bid
on a controversial piece of land
that &apos;s right where beach region is .
and don &apos;t you think that &apos;s relevant to ian &apos;s murder ?
i didn &apos;t know about it .
ian kept things very close to the vest .
here &apos;s all of his expenditures for the past six months .
land projects , donations , payroll .
who are the gillis brothers ?
i have no idea . i &apos;ve never heard of them .
well , ian paid them twice in the two weeks before he died .
gillis brothers is a law firm .
they aren &apos;t one of coral prince &apos;s law firms .
i &apos;d know about them .
check his personal e @-@ mail .
see if he corresponded with them .
there .
they were his personal estate planning attorneys .
he was changing his will .
yeah ? kono .
ian adams changed his will just before he died .
why ?
to make ben bass his beneficiary .
what ? why would he do that ?
i don &apos;t know , but i &apos;m gonna go
and see if i can get a copy of that new will .
but , kono , ben stood to inherit everything .
that &apos;s even more motive .
i &apos;ll call you back .
this is where you work ?
tough girl , huh ?
when i have to be .
so what &apos;s going on ?
i got the message you wanted to talk .
did you know that ian recently changed his will
to name you his estate &apos;s primary beneficiary ?
uh , uh , no .
he was also in the final stages of purchasing the land
the beach village is on .
what ?
are you saying you didn &apos;t know ?
am i saying i didn &apos;t know ?
no , i didn &apos;t know .
you know , like i said , ian came around the village
the last couple weeks , saying he was a changed man .
i didn &apos;t buy it .
you have to give me more than that .
like what ?
if @-@ if ian was buying the land to develop it
and evict all of you ,
you had motive to kill him .
come on , kono .
you don &apos;t honestly think i ...
ben , i have to ask the question . it &apos;s my job .
you brought me here because i &apos;m a suspect ?
no one can confirm your alibi
because you were alone on the beach collecting water samples .
that &apos;s right , i was .
you saw me ...
you have a hunting license .
and so do most of the guys who grew up
on the island , kono ; we hunt .
i &apos;m going to need your rifle .
do i need a lawyer ?
yes .
hpd is holding ben bass on probable cause .
unless we can charge him with ian &apos;s murder ,
he &apos;s gonna walk in 48 hours .
what about ballistics ; they give us anything ?
no . the test on ben &apos;s rifle
isn &apos;t inconclusive . what about those satellite maps ?
there &apos;s nothing showing the spot where ben said he was
at the time of the murder .
that doesn &apos;t mean he did it .
doesn &apos;t mean he didn &apos;t .
sorry , kono .
traced the partial plate
that kono caught back to a tour operation
called katonk jeep and bike rentals .
guess who works there .
who ?
oh , look at that . our buddies , levi and diego .
wait a minute . don &apos;t you guys think
it &apos;s a little coincidental that these guys are trying
to destroy the same land that ian was trying to buy ?
i think that it warrants another conversation
at the very least . come on .
diego !
okay , i got a daughter !
trust me . i know these roads .
this is not a road !
the road has asphalt . two lanes .
this is dirt on a trail , okay ? it &apos;s a long way down .
scared ?
no , i &apos;m not scared .
i &apos;m rationally concerned !
hands off the wheel now !
brah , we never do nothing .
you didn &apos;t ? where &apos;d you get the donut ?
my girlfriend got a little rough last night .
that wasn &apos;t your girlfriend , that was our partner ,
and you &apos;re lucky you made it out
of that beach village with only a mark .
you cops , you can &apos;t do nothing .
we &apos;re not scared of you .
now how do you think that makes me feel ?
i mean , here i am , a duly sworn officer of the law
and you are showing me zero respect .
i mean , it &apos;s hurtful , really .
who &apos;s that ?
that is someone you are scared of .
kawika , we never do nothing .
thanks for coming all this way , kawika .
tell the haole cop everything he wants to know .
who paid you to burn that village ?
randall .
randall . randall who ? last name ?
barrett .
it &apos;s the guy that drives carlton bass around .
how do you know him ?
we met him at koko head , shooting .
you met randall at the rifle range ?
yeah . where else you gonna shoot at koko head , huh ?
yes , sir , mr. police .
what else can you tell us about randall ?
we took him to pupukea .
he said he wanted a clear shot of pipeline .
chin , we got randall heading east on ala wai boulevard .
let &apos;s box him in from the west .
consider him armed and dangerous .
randall barrett , get out of the car .
out !
on your knees .
get down !
cross your legs .
steve .
what ?
looks like we found our murder weapon .
it &apos;s not that black and white .
ben , what &apos;s going on ?
why did you call me ?
son ?
don &apos;t you ever call me that again .
ben ...
he knows .
what are you talking about ?
he knows you had ian killed .
that &apos;s insane .
carlton bass , you &apos;re under arrest
for the contract murder of ian adams .
are you kidding me ?
no , he &apos;s actually not kidding .
we have randall and your two goons levi and diego
in our custody now .
you hired &apos; em to torch the beach village ,
then set them up for murder ,
knowing they had a beef with ian .
yeah , so you &apos;re probably not gonna walk away
free from this one .
so it &apos;s my word against that of my driver and two ex @-@ cons .
you know what ? i &apos;ll take my chances .
&quot; i , ian adams , hereby bequeath my ownership stake
&quot; in the coral prince corporation to my only living relative ,
my son , bennett bass . &quot;
when did you find out ian was ben &apos;s father ?
ben said that ian had been coming around
trying to get back in his life .
did ben &apos;s mom confess to ian ?
did she tell you ?
you had plans to build
a resort on that beach village land ,
but ian got there first .
he was gonna give the land to ben .
but you had him killed before he could finalize the deal .
