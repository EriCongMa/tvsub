meadow , do you have a tampon ?
i &apos;m spotting and the dispenser is out .
you had an examination ?
it &apos;s the middle of the month . this never happens to me .
here .
imagine having your portrait in a museum .
she &apos;s a rich merchant &apos;s wife . it &apos;s how rubens made money .
you talk the talk , miss art history . i &apos;ve never seen these grades from you .
well , you take intro to semiotics .
if you spent less time in jackie &apos;s car ...
please .
that is so over .
just like that ? what happened ?
are you crying ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
i don &apos;t know . just look at it .
&quot; jusepe de ribera . the mystical marriage of saint catherine . &quot;
that &apos;s the baby jesus .
she &apos;s marrying a baby ? good luck .
we all do .
what ?
i shouldn &apos;t be sarcastic .
just look at her .
the little baby &apos;s hand against her cheek .
she &apos;s so at peace .
a beautiful , innocent , gorgeous little baby .
come on , let &apos;s go eat .
tony !
come on . i &apos;m sorry about what happened .
you won &apos;t return my calls .
go fuck yourself .
tony .
we have something too special to just ... over one argument .
one argument ? you threw a fucking dinner at my head , gloria .
if you were a guy , you know where you &apos;d be .
but you were late . you kept me waiting three hours ...
what about the present ? you threw it into the barnegat bay .
all right , i ...
i &apos;m having a bad couple of weeks . shit with my family and other crap .
i was trying to act in control and not dwell on it . it &apos;s no excuse .
we can &apos;t talk about your problems ?
i didn &apos;t wanna bother you .
well , i had a lot on my plate .
can i see you later ?
i &apos;m late for my appointment .
me and this broad , we &apos;re like ...
... leather and lace .
a burning ring of fire . whatever .
amour fou .
as the french call it .
crazy love , all @-@ consuming .
that &apos;s it .
we push each other &apos;s buttons .
most people don &apos;t push your buttons .
that &apos;s not true .
now , i know you think i &apos;m like a hard , cold , captain @-@ of @-@ industry type .
that &apos;s not all there is .
i don &apos;t know .
she gets freaky .
is she a full @-@ blown loop @-@ do @-@ loo or what ?
as you know , i cannot ...
discuss another patient .
if i duke you a five ?
i &apos;m not charging you . last month you overpaid .
you gave me good tips .
i won &apos;t have it .
don &apos;t offer it again .
all right . jesus .
back to gloria .
she never wants money .
and you like this ?
she &apos;s , you know , very independent @-@ minded . that i do like .
you see her as independent , strong .
she &apos;s not ?
we &apos;re talking about your perceptions .
she made her own way in the world .
irina was such a helpless , fucking baby .
but gloria knows a lot , about a lot of shit .
buddhism , and the movies ...
she went to morocco all by herself .
and those eyes .
those dark , black eyes .
when she stares at you , it &apos;s like ...
like a spanish princess in one of those paintings . a goya .
those eyes are deep .
complicated .
complicated ? i said deep .
you said dark .
whenever i bring her up , you get this weird puss .
you ask if she seems happy . like she &apos;s not .
or if she reminds me of somebody . like you don &apos;t like it .
amo @-@ fo , or whatever you call it .
you &apos;ve told me what you see in gloria . what does she see in you ?
oh , please , huh ?
what does she see in me ?
with all the faggots and crybabies around .
whatever else i am , i &apos;m not ...
i &apos;m more of ...
well , you know , like i said ...
captain @-@ of @-@ industry type .
you &apos;re a tough guy .
oh , come on .
you can say it .
you embarrass me with that .
does gloria know what you do for a living ?
you mentioned fire .
can we say that certain kinds of people are drawn to fire ?
looking for an inevitable result , like a moth to a flame ?
and this is gloria ?
and i &apos;m the flame ?
why would anybody hit you , of all people , with a side of beef ?
she &apos;s complicated .
i said complicated . dark , you said .
no , i said her eyes are dark .
nice . not bad .
since we &apos;re kicking up ...
... we were hoping you could , you know ...
... watch our back ?
350 buys you &quot; hello . &quot;
watching your back ...
that &apos;s gonna require a little more initiative on your part .
oh , look at the face .
what &apos;s he got to be frowning about ?
tell me , romeo .
now that you moved home ...
... you gonna be humping tony soprano &apos;s girl on our couch ?
fuck her .
and tony &apos;s stay @-@ in @-@ school shit . he could have reached out to rutgers .
he should break the dean &apos;s legs because you won &apos;t read .
now go ahead . i gotta make some calls .
you did good .
keep coming by .
go . go .
i knew a moroccan guy once . he hit and ran me . i tracked him down .
i never forget a face .
jesus christ ! that &apos;s the oldest joke in the book .
jesus christ !
hello ?
no , you have the wrong number .
what ?
i thought it might be my sister .
that family shit you were telling me about ?
it &apos;s okay if you don &apos;t wanna talk about it . really .
she said i can never see my niece and nephew again .
right before christmas .
we had a new santa at our party .
wasn &apos;t good .
i love those children .
so much .
she said i turned them against their dad . i didn &apos;t .
not that he doesn &apos;t deserve it . fucking crackhead sack of shit .
hannah and seamus go to this alternative , private ...
... elementary school in santa monica .
where it &apos;s all about self @-@ esteem .
i hate that shit .
i ask hannah , she &apos;s a third @-@ grader , &quot; will you be in the christmas play ? &quot;
and she says , &quot; we call it the winter festival . &quot;
so i go , &quot; whatever . &quot; i don &apos;t say anything .
and then seamus says :
&quot; we can &apos;t say christmas . we call christmas &apos; the c @-@ word . &apos; &quot;
and i fucking flipped out .
what did seamus say ?
what the fuck does he know ? he &apos;s 10 .
so my sister gets mad because her husband ...
... teaches there , except he &apos;s on leave for drug abuse treatment .
and one thing led to another and ...
she said i always had it in for john .
and she forbid me to see them again .
he smokes crack ?
without those two kids ...
maybe we &apos;ll all get lucky . the way these trucks go by out here ?
maybe i &apos;ll get plastered on a grill .
what ?
i &apos;m just kidding . it never rains .
i think they &apos;re gonna fire me over at globe .
fucking arnie mills sexually harasses me and then dares me to sue .
anyway .
fuck them .
you like this song ?
it &apos;s okay .
i love this song .
yeah ?
guys , if you &apos;re gonna smoke , take it outside .
fuck &apos;s the matter ? speak english ?
who are you ?
the owner is a dear friend .
that should be enough for you .
fuck him too .
what you fucking say ?
chill ! relax !
jackie . what are you doing ?
it &apos;s under control .
go find a fucking taco bell before i cap your asses .
get the fuck out of here .
oh , shit . take this .

jerry , i &apos;ll give her a lift . i &apos;m going out anyway .
gloria trillo .
carmela soprano . you don &apos;t mind ?
give me a minute , let me grab a demo .
this is sweet of you .
don &apos;t believe it . everybody is a potential sale .
so , what do you do ?
i &apos;m a homemaker .
you must make a very nice home to drive a benz .
so you &apos;re married ?
yes .
kids ?
two . you ?
no . to both .
boys ? girls ?
one boy , one girl .
the boy is still in high school and my daughter &apos;s in college .
she &apos;s not too far away though .
she &apos;s in new york city .
she &apos;s at columbia .
school of broadcasting ?
the university . it &apos;s in the lvy league , one of the top schools .
i know . i was just kidding .
oh .

at least your daughter doesn &apos;t need a man for success .
thank god .
that &apos;s a beautiful ring .
thank you .

he &apos;s in a few businesses .
sounds mysterious .
no , no , it &apos;s not , really .
my daughter calls us bourgeois .
thank you so much .
no problem . it was nice to meet you .
you too .
nice house .
thank you .
i tell you , the thing i like about moltisanti ?
he &apos;ll even tell tony soprano to go fuck himself .
the guy &apos;s fearless .
who &apos;s fearless ?
chris moltisanti . where &apos;s my mother ?
she &apos;s an early riser .
what about moltisanti ?
we were saying he &apos;s young to be made . that kind of shit .
he wanted it so he stepped up and took it .
like your dad and tony soprano . know how they made their names ?
how ?
we got any marshmallows ?
come on , what about my father ?
when we was kids , we had our own little crew .
me , your dad , buon &apos; anima , tony , silvio dante .
we &apos;d do mickey mouse scores , you know , moving pot ...
... swag . bullshit stuff .
we thought we were like the sixth family .
but who knew we was even alive ?
till one fucking night .
and i gotta give your father credit .
he had balls as big as an irish broad &apos;s ass .
there was this old ...
... old mustache named ...
... feech lamanna .
what feech meant , who the fuck knows ?
but he was made on the other side , so he was an original .
he was an o.g.
whatever .
he had this saturday night card game ...
... and your father sees a chance to rise to the a @-@ league .
connected or not , him , me and tony were gonna rob him .
we thought your father lost a marble .
but he said , &quot; fuck it . &quot;
balls .
what happened ?
they took it down and walked away with 20 large .
jesus christ .
what do you mean , &quot; they &quot; ? you didn &apos;t go ?
i &apos;m still sick over it .
i caught the clap from some hippie broad i was fucking .
my dick was dripping like a busted pipe .
anyways , the rest is history .
your father and tony was on the fast track to being made , and i ...
... was still a little shit here , like the two of you .
and of course i , whatever ... but that was a few years later .
they get away with it ?
what could feech do ?
there was a sit @-@ down .
and the right people got some of their money back ...
... but the point was made .
your father and tony were rising stars to be respected .
cocksuckers .
all right , kiddies . that &apos;s enough for tonight .
oh , jackie .
rinse those plates before you put them in the dishwasher . it clogs .
we can &apos; t help but be amazed at the instincts they possess .
to protect all manner of livestock . to be protective of us .
what can we do to protect them ?
nurture their defenses ...
... using the natural body defense system in pedigree .
what is wrong with me ?
pedigree .
are you drunk ?
how about right here ?
you would , wouldn &apos;t you ? huh ?
does my car look slanted ?
oh , shit .
i have a flat .
oh , my god .
jesus christ .
so creepy .
why ?
i don &apos;t know .
what ?
what ?
you know who did this , don &apos;t you ?
what ?
i saw that look . at least don &apos;t lie to me .
what do i know about your tires ?
fine .
thanks for your help .
one time .
my ex @-@ girlfriend , she got a little jealous and she slashed my tires .
that thought went through my mind just then .
it couldn &apos;t have been her .
the cunt that called ?
my car &apos;s fucked !
you work for a dealer .
you think i get free tires ?
so i &apos;ll pay for it !
why offer if you didn &apos;t have a guilty conscience ?
about what ?
i don &apos;t know . tell me .
this is fucking bullshit . i &apos;m going home .
who else would do it ?
kids , maybe .
ruin a great evening over this !
kids !
maybe your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
maybe mr. globe , since you &apos;re america &apos;s sweetheart this week .
where the fuck do you get off ?
this immigrant , alcoholic , probably hiv @-@ laden slut ...
whoa with that !
... slashes my tires and you call my life into question ?
she wouldn &apos;t do it ! i slapped the piss out of her .
oh . did you ?
did you really hit her ?
i don &apos;t know .
she &apos;s a poor , confused kid from an underdeveloped country .
even if she did do this .
i &apos;ll make some calls . i &apos;ll have new michelins in an hour .
what are these ? 85 @-@ r16 &apos;s ? what ?
jesus christ .
all right , 17 &apos;s !
gene pontecorvo &apos;s got a card game . we could take it down now .
are you crazy ? he &apos;s with ralph .
essentially , that &apos;s ralph &apos;s game .
even better . fuck him and his rinse @-@ your @-@ dishes shit .
know what ? i think he &apos;s a secret fag .
i don &apos;t know .
maybe take carlo . he &apos;s got a shotgun . we wear masks .
we go in . we &apos;re out in like two minutes .
what if they find out it &apos;s us ?
we want them to .
not right away , but like ralph said .
when they do , you know it &apos;s gonna get squashed .
my old man was jackie aprile .
the worse that &apos;ll happen , we give some back .
we pull this off ...
... we &apos;re like free agents . we dictate the terms , not them .
because we show balls .
come on , call carlo .
fuck . there &apos;s no signal .
i &apos;d have to be pretty stupid to write a book about killing ...
use that phone .
oh , yeah , this one .
come on , hurry up , call carlo .
they show my favorite part yet ?
i think it &apos;s coming up .
the answer &apos;s no .
dude , move over . give me some room .
fuck you , it &apos;s my house .
here it comes .
yeah .
like a cigarette , nick ?
you two know each other ?
no .
i saw a psychiatrist . that &apos;s why father intintola said we should talk .
he said you were getting a doctorate in psychiatry .
psychology .
the psychiatrist told me my whole life is a lie , and he &apos;s right .
and now i think i &apos;m sick .
and if i die , i will never be with god in eternity .
you &apos;re ill ?
i think i have ovarian cancer .
what does the doctor say ?
i haven &apos;t seen one .
i &apos;m afraid .
why do you think you are ill ?
i &apos;m spotting . lower back pain .
my hormones are all over the place . my cousin kathy died from it .
god doesn &apos;t punish people for mistakes that they &apos;ve made .
he loves you more than you know .
have you thought , with your symptoms , you might be with child ?
i know , that &apos;s another ...
would you be more comfortable if we set this sacrament aside ...
... and stepped into my office ?
the psychiatrist said i should leave my husband .
when he said that , it seemed so right .
you made a sacred vow . divorce is out of the question .
unless ... is he abusive , your husband ?
not to me . but he is unfaithful .
he &apos;s a good man basically , but ...
i talked to father intintola years ago , and here i am .
do you love your husband ?
i do .
i love my husband . and i love god .
but my life is financed by crime .
his crime .
fifty thousand dollars to my daughter &apos;s college .
the psychiatrist says it &apos;s all blood money .
now , to maybe bring another child into this ?
god understands that we all live in the middle of tensions .
you say your husband has good in him .
what you have to do is learn to live on what the good part earns .
the what ?
there is a point inside yourself .
an inner boundary beyond which you feel culpable .
you &apos;ve got to come to an awareness of where that line is .
and forego those things which lay without it .
the church has changed so much .
it &apos;s a complex world .
learn to live on the good part .
forego those things that lay without it .
i think i can do that , father .
i &apos;ll try .
and go see an ob @-@ gyn .
this mad @-@ cow disease .
it &apos;s terrible the english government didn &apos;t tell people .
maybe they didn &apos;t wanna create a stampede .
oh , by the way ...
... guess which former medical student no longer dates the queen of mean .
you &apos;re kidding .
jackie jr. and meadow are finished ?
frankly , i am delighted .
kevin told angie bonpensiero that jackie was smoking marijuana .
and was caught cheating at rutgers .
gee , that bad ?
that black kid would &apos;ve been better .
he &apos;s got a 4.0 and he &apos;s moving to india for the u.n.
i told you .
that &apos;s my fault .
she wasted three months with jackie jr .
hello .
mrs. soprano !
gloria trillo , globe motors .
hi , how are you ?
i hope this is a good time . the new e @-@ 320 just came in .
you might wanna take a look .
no , i don &apos;t think so . i still have another year on my lease .
maybe your husband will treat you .
maybe i will . thank you for calling .
okay , bye . hope to see you !
bye @-@ bye .
well , what a nice woman .
who ?
just some saleswoman from globe motors .
what ?
she wants me to try the new wagon . i &apos;m not interested , but she was nice .
she took me home while they serviced the wagon .
i should hold onto it another year , don &apos;t you think ?
another year .
yeah .
i was just wondering if we could switch days off .
give me a minute .
we could switch ...
i got a customer coming in , all right ? tony .
are you out of your fucking mind , talking to my wife ?
i was upset about your ex @-@ girlfriend . i thought you should see my version .
i &apos;m sorry , all right ?
you drove her home . what the fuck ?
then you look right into my eyes and don &apos;t tell me ?
it &apos;s normal to be curious about someone you love &apos;s significant others .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s fucking twisted .
it is not .
i don &apos;t wanna argue . you &apos;re upset .
i know it &apos;s on the margins for someone like you ...
... and it &apos;ll never happen again .
no shit .
you can tell your shrink you ruined eight relationships .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s fucking over .
tony !
you see , tuesday i can take my kid to hear raffi .
left ovary .
right ovary .
just tell me right out . don &apos;t mince words .
i didn &apos; t like people knowing my personal life .
where is this asshole now ? what did he have , one song ?
what ?
we should do what we gotta do .
call carlo .
who the fuck was feech lamanna ?
you know what ? don &apos;t come .
you wanna spend your life with your head up your ass , be my guest .
how &apos;s your calamari salad ?
he &apos;s not using the right olive oil .
you haven &apos;t said two words , carmela .
sorry .
i came from dr. rotelli &apos;s .
everything all right ?
i &apos;ve never been better . just a thyroid thing .
thank god .
i thought i was pregnant .
bite your tongue . at our age ?
with the kids growing up and all ...
i want a grandchild . terry and her husband are trying , but ...
speaking of kids , i am sick about jackie and meadow .
i ask , he tells me to mind my own business .
so does she .
they broke up ?
is meadow okay ?
she &apos;s so different than i was . it rolls off her back .
no weight loss or sleepless nights .
not like what we go through .
because we married them .
it &apos;s not just us . the president of the united states ...
his wife put up with the blowjobs and the stained dress .
hillary clinton ? i can &apos;t stand her .
we could all take a page from her book .
to be publicly humiliated and go around smiling ?
that is so false . i would dig a hole , climb into it and not come out .
all i know is , she stuck by him , put up with the bullshit ...
... and she set up her own little thing .
she took all that negative shit he gave her and spun it into gold .
you gotta give her credit .
well , that &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ?
she &apos;s a role model for all of us .
no , the case is still pending .
they could try me on mail and wire fraud ,
but they want a major rico .
tony . line two .
who is it ?
it &apos;s a woman . i think she &apos;s crying .
let me get back to you .
hello .
tony .
i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t know , i don &apos;t ...
i can &apos;t understand you .
i can &apos;t take it anymore .
i don &apos; t know ... i don &apos; t know why . i don &apos; t know why .
tony .
thanks for coming .
all right .
you want something to drink ?
no .
i &apos;m sorry . there &apos;s no one else i can talk to .
what about him ?
laugh if you want . he helps .
he &apos;s a captain marvel .
i just want it to be the way it was .
i love you .
stop it .
i &apos;m sorry .
quit crying . i can &apos;t stand it .
i wanna be with you .
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
i know .
i know .
my life &apos;s a trip to nowhere .
you bring it on yourself .
you &apos;re a beautiful , talented woman .
but you ...
you push a man away .
that &apos;s not gonna happen again .
the other night with the tires . i &apos;m a grown man . i &apos;ve had other women .
you think i lived in a freezer ?
fine .
i &apos;ll sit back like a mute while you screw every woman out there .
see , there &apos;s that tone again .
look .
it &apos;s over .
i mean , we had our mo @-@ fo , or whatever .
and it was great .
and now it &apos;s time to put it to bed .
you think you can treat me like some stupid goombah housewife ?
you think i &apos;ll let some fucker shit over me ...
... just because he buys me some ridiculous , gaudy ring ?
where the fuck do you get off ?
you don &apos;t care .
think you &apos;re the only one with problems ? my life &apos;s a fucking picnic ?
poor you .
you got a dream life compared to mine . nobody cares if i &apos;m alive or dead !
i didn &apos;t just meet you .
i &apos;ve known you my whole life .
that &apos;s right .
take a dump wherever you please and walk away .

... meanwhile we &apos;re the only ones who play by the rules .
i loved you .
what happens , i decide .
you don &apos;t love me , that hurts , but too bad .
because you don &apos;t gotta love me . but you will respect me .
ralph cifaretto &apos;s here .
what &apos;d we say ?
ton .
how you doing ?
it &apos;s terrible , huh ?
yeah .
ro &apos;s going nuts . she knows he hangs around with dino .
any word from her son ?
no , no .
all right , come on .
this kid .
he did a terrible thing .
terrible .
your fucking card game .
i know you &apos;re close to the family .
no , i feel for you . you &apos;re living under the same roof .
and it was my card game .
but what happened to sunshine ...
... is a disgrace .
but to tell you the truth , tony ...
... i wanna give the kid a pass .
yeah ?
it &apos;s just me though . i know you got bigger concerns .
you &apos;re the boss , and ...
i &apos;ll make sure your orders are done .
i think you should go with your instincts on this , ralph .
you do ?
but furio took a hit . chris . these are made men .
i &apos;ll make sure they respect your decision .
because i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll do the right thing .
that &apos;s why i made you captain .
this is rosalie &apos;s kid .
that &apos;s why i &apos;ll understand if you give him a pass . everybody else will too .
who cares about shit they don &apos;t have the balls to say to your face ?
kid disrespected you .
but they don &apos;t have to live with your commitments .
but , hey , the decision goes the other way ?
the one thing you cannot do , ralph , you cannot do ...
... is blame yourself .
you took this kid under your wing .
you schooled him as best you could .
didn &apos;t you ?
jack spoiled him .
i think this is yours .
the stupid kid was carrying it around during the holidays .
she wanted me to fucking kill her .
like suicide by cop .
so she set me up ?
she saw me as only a fucking hammer ?
she loved you .
she looked so good too , that day in your office .
just another irina with a college degree .
ask yourself .
how did you recognize in gloria , under her layers of sophistication ...
... this deeply wounded , angry being that would let you replicate ...
... your relationship with your mother ?
i don &apos;t wanna fuck my mother . you &apos;re never gonna convince me .
not fuck .
try to please her .
try to win her love .
forty fucking years old .
we need to repeat what &apos;s familiar , even if it &apos;s bad for us .
gloria &apos;s need for drama .
the selfishness . the incessant self @-@ regard .
at one time ...
... in your mother &apos;s hands , it passed for love .
all right , look . you &apos;re her doctor . you tell me .
do i gotta worry about this broad ?
she says she &apos;s gonna tell carmela about us .
i honestly can &apos;t predict .
we should deal with ...
... why are you so attracted to dangerous relationships ?
why do you put your marriage in such danger ?
maybe i &apos;m looking for a way out .
anthony .
you &apos;ll never leave your wife .
bullshit . there &apos;s a limit .
she might leave you , but you &apos;ll never leave her .
despite your mothering ...
... you made one good decision in your life vis- ? vis women .
you won &apos;t throw that over .
your own selfishness is too strong to let that happen .
all right . all right .
actually , in spite of everything you &apos;re a very conventional man .
i said all right .
we have to stop now .
got pep , i &apos;ll give it that .
zero to 60 in under seven seconds .
what &apos;s the matter , you don &apos;t like me ?
i &apos;m not back , they call the cops , standard operating procedure .
here &apos;s standard operating procedure . stay away from tony soprano .
shut the fuck up and listen . it &apos;s over , capisce ?
over and done .
you call or go anywhere near him or his family ...
... and they &apos;ll be scraping your nipples off these leather seats .
and here &apos;s the point to remember .
my face is the last one you &apos;ll see . not tony &apos;s .
we understand each other ?
it won &apos;t be cinematic .
any word , anything ?
he probably went down to florida .
ro , i &apos;m sure he &apos;s fine .
ro , come on .
look .
this will be hard for you to hear .
jesus christ !
no , it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s just ...
... he has a very serious drug problem .
what ?
it &apos;s coke . he may owe some money to dealers .
oh , my god .
i didn &apos;t wanna tell you .
look , we &apos;re doing everything we can .
we &apos;re gonna find him .
we &apos;ll get him help .
we &apos;ll get him to rehab .
let &apos;s just hope he &apos;s not too far gone .
something smells good .
lemon snaps for the bake sale at church .
you look good .
i went to step today .
is that why you don &apos;t have these looney @-@ tune moods when you exercise ?
where &apos;s your ring ?
i had to get it sized . it &apos;s a little big .
hi , it &apos;s me . i &apos;ll be home in about twenty minutes .
yeah , i picked up the stuffed shells .
