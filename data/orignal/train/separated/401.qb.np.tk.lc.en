now from these experiments
a few factors became evident .
one was the realization
that serial killers have been with us
since the dawn of man .
please let him go .
take whatever you want take anything
but please let my son go .
my name is professor james fallon .
i &apos;m a scientist-- neuroscientist--
and i study the human brain .
it is a complex and sometimes lethal machine .
in a blind experiment colleagues sent me
70 mri brain scans
and i had no idea who these brains belonged to .
some were normals some were schizophrenics
and some were killers .
i analyzed all of them
5 of which i determined were the brains of psychopaths .
and it turned out that indeed
these 5 were the brains of serial killers
some of whom you know .
in studies such as these
one looks at the biological factors ...
that is the genetics and also the brain pathology .
the 5 brains we identified
all had damage to the orbital cortex
which is right above the eyes .
now high @-@ risk allele of the monoamine oxidase a
the maoa gene
may also be present in these people
and that &apos;s key .
now under the effects of the high @-@ risk gene
the brain of the psychopath was bathed
in way too much serotonin during fetal development .
as an adult
this brain is now numb
the first dangerous elements are now in place .
the damage is done .
now this is a recipe for catastrophe .
so when the fetus reaches the day of labor
the potential serial killer is born .
mom !
mom !
hey how was your weekend ?
uh scary yet informative . was the whole family killed ?
hudson this is dr. spencer reid .
field agent anne hudson .
the uh father is serving in iraq .
3 nights ago the cops found his family buried over there .
buried ?
the neighbors heard the dog barking came over
and he was scratching at the grave .
lucy their oldest child she &apos;s still in her swimsuit .
what does the father know ?
some of it . he was on patrol .
took his unit a couple of days to reach him .
he arrives today .
last year the williams family
was killed and found exactly the same way .
they lived in newport news .
the father dan williams was also serving overseas .
now the police are overwhelmed
and getting serious heat from the military .
we need some answers fast .
as do the media .
they &apos;re already calling this the work of a serial killer .
they &apos;re right . it is .
but why bury them ?
i mean it can &apos;t be to hide the bodies .
it &apos;s a sign of remorse .
and when they &apos;re done being remorseful
this will happen again .
&quot; man usually avoids attributing cleverness to somebody else
unless it &apos;s an enemy . &quot;
albert einstein .
no sign of a struggle .
unsub holds a gun to one of her kids &apos; head .
what can she do ?
footprints belong to paul .
somehow he managed to get away .
mom gets it first then the youngest .
he hides in the master bedroom
the unsub finds him and shoots him .
and carries him out to the backyard .
but not the mother . she &apos;s dragged out .
it &apos;s quick and proficient .
for the mother and the boys maybe .
but lucy &apos;s drowned and not shot .
why the change in m.o. ?
f @-@ 22 raptor .
yeah . it &apos;s about to get way louder and much busier .
tomorrow is langley &apos;s 50th anniversary air show .
the father of the first family killed--dan williams
where is he now ?
he put in for another tour of iraq .
an i.e.d. killed him 2 months ago .
whoever did this
knew both fathers were serving overseas .
laura downey &apos;s wedding rings are missing .
any other valuables ?
we &apos;ll have to ask the husband .
from the williams home
only jewelry and watches were missing .
the unsub only took what he can carry
which means he &apos;s most likely on foot .
there was a photo on the wall in the kitchen .
i &apos;d like to see it .
sure .
there &apos;s no sign of sexual assault
in the williams case . what about lucy ?
nothing on the coroner &apos;s report .
multiple suspects ?
the mother was dragged out of the house .
if it had been multiple suspects
they probably would have carried her .
he knew the father was absent
therefore the dominant threat was absent .
so we could be looking for a single suspect .
no sign of forced entry .
no need . lucy was in the pool
back door was open . the unsub walked right in .
that means lucy probably died last .
in both cases the girls were suffocated
and not shot . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s a coincidence .
hey garcia . you &apos;re on speaker .
we just got a call
from virginia super max prison .
one of the inmates there
has received 2 envelopes in the last 2 days .
first envelope had clippings of the newport news killings .
second envelope had media clippings of the downey family .
in the second envelope was a note saying
&quot; look at what i &apos;ve done &quot; and both pieces of mail
have been signed by &quot; an admirer . &quot;
who &apos;s the inmate ?
that &apos;s the part that ...
karl arnold .
the fox
the fox
he &apos;s back .
ok thanks .
family annihilator absent father wedding rings .
it &apos;s similar .
to what ?
4 years ago karl arnold aka the fox
killed 8 families .
just like this case he took wedding rings
only he took them as trophies .
he &apos;d hide in the bushes outside the homes .
and i watched them ... for a number of days .
always at night .
saw how they lived ...
how they loved .
i would keep them apart until the last night .
then i would bring them one by one
down to the basement
the youngest first .
the father last .
why karl ?
so he could see what happens ... to families
when the head of household isn &apos;t strong .
wives wither ...
children perish .
so we &apos;re working with a copycat here ?
it &apos;s too early to assume anything .
it could bias the profile .
not to mention the police the media and the military
would jump all over it .
until we &apos;re positive none of this information leaves the 7 of us .
hotch you gave evidence at arnold &apos;s trial .
i think you should go see him .
i &apos;d like to take prentiss with me .
let &apos;s go .
have garcia check on all of arnold &apos;s
prison correspondence and visitors for the last 4 years .
ok .
captain joseph downey has arrived back at the station .
captain downey please sit .
thank you i &apos;m fine .
tell me everything .
at around 9 : 30.3 nights ago
your neighbors called police when ...
i &apos;m sorry .
sir .
we believe it was the work of a serial killer .
i &apos;m sorry . my neighbors uh jack and penny ...
captain downey ...
your family was murdered .
all of them .
is there someone you &apos;d like us to call ?
uh call um ... no no . i uh ...
i &apos;d like to go home now .
captain downey . captain downey . captain d ...
ok .
ok .
i &apos;m sorry .
i &apos;m so sorry .
so why wait a year to send karl a note
unless they were communicating the whole time ?
that &apos;s the first thing we need to find out .
but karl has a big ego .
he &apos;s gonna want to answer a question with a question .
he &apos;s trying to gain the advantage of me by asking
why i &apos;m not wearing my wedding ring .
and then he will turn his attention to you .
so that &apos;s why you brought me along .
your presence will throw him off guard .
then he &apos;s gonna want to describe to you in graphic detail
every sexual act he committed with the families .
to freak me out ?
to pull you into his fantasy .
control open on 16 .
keep your eyes forward .
more than anything he &apos;s going to want
to see the images of the children .
we can &apos;t give him that .
we have to give him something
or we &apos;ll get nothing from him .
come on !
isn &apos;t that uh ...
garrett pain . that &apos;s reinforced glass .
easy for you to say . he tore apart 14 women .
open on 15 .
whoa baby !
hello karl .
agent hotchner .
i wasn &apos;t informed you were bring in a uh ...
they just said two agents .
this is agent ...
i know all about you .
if this unsub &apos;s copying the fox
then we profile him like the fox .
karl arnold worked as a psychologist &apos;s assistant right ?
yeah . which made it easy for him to watch target
and learn about the victims from a distance .
yeah it also made him hard to find .
like the fox our man here found a way to hide in plain sight .
but he &apos;s pulling from 2 completely different units .
williams a medic downey an army captain .
someone knew of that military connection .
both families were attacked within a
month of the fathers being deployed .
gave them time to settle in
get comfortable that the fathers weren &apos;t there .
and once inside the home the fox would live with the families
and then become the father .
but not this unsub .
he just walked in and dispensed with the family .
living with them wasn &apos;t part of the fantasy .
agent rossi .
the picture you requested .
thanks to you we pulled some prints off it .
and all the prints were on lucy .
the bullet hit the father dead center .
the prints match that of the newport news killings .
it &apos;s the same killer .
family annihilators like the fox they start with one victim .
and once they feel capable
they move on to a second victim .
they don &apos;t start with entire families .
there are more victims . we just haven &apos;t found them yet .
karl it appears you have a fan .
admirer .
not a fan .
big difference . right ?
is this the first time you &apos;ve
been contacted by your admirer ?
i have many fans .
even my own website .
don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;d be astounded at some of the questions they ask .
i make a log of all of them . would you like to read some ?
i would love to .
you &apos;d love to ?
yes .
here .
look .
maybe later .
your admirer is taking wedding rings just like you .
but maybe not for the same reason .
like how you took all of mine .
you took mine .
but i see ... you lost yours .
8 rings 4 families .
or was it one ring for each family ?
how &apos;d you come to lose your ring ?
wait don &apos;t tell me .
a casualty of the job .
my job is what put you in here .
true .
but then it &apos;s the children who suffer most . wouldn &apos;t you agree ?
you &apos;d know more about that than me .
which is why you came to me .
i can help you with that agent hotchner .
i certainly can .
but i &apos;ll need to see those photos .
may i ?
a word ?
is there a problem emily ?
there &apos;s no problem karl .
we cannot show him these .
these images will be his undoing and our way in .
but they &apos;re not just images .
that &apos;s exactly what they are .
we can &apos;t use lucy like that .
it &apos;s a tradeoff we have to make .
so we are using a dead 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl in a bathing suit
as a bargaining chip ? for what ?
to him it &apos;s not just a photograph .
it &apos;s much much more and we need to know what .
look i &apos;m ...
i &apos;ve never done this before .
and you don &apos;t have to now .
yes i do .
all right . when i feel he &apos;s ready to talk
i &apos;ll leave the room .
you get him talking .
whatever he does whatever you feel
just stay on script .
we need to know why he killed those families .
he &apos;s had a smattering of visits
a couple of whack jobs contact him
but nothing as direct as this admirer person .
how are we doing on the prints on the picture ?
oh . i &apos;m still running them .
how are you holding up ?
military families they always fear the worst .
they know their men may not return
but this--
to see a father lose so much .
i wish i had something for you .
i truly cannot find a damn thing that connects these families .
geographically both of them
are thousands of miles away from their family .
communication &apos;s all they had--
emails phone calls letters .
but that &apos;s military communication .
even between families
it requires a kind of juice i &apos;m not allowed to use .
come on . you hacked into the fbi database .
and they gave me a job .
and i like my job .
and i like my life .
all right i &apos;ll make some inquiries .
ok . do that . take care .
so lucy dies last alone .
this by itself doesn &apos;t really mean anything
but when we look again at the williams file
we notice that the majority of the foreign fingerprints
came from karen williams &apos; room
which means the unsub spent most
of his time in there with karen .
then he must have separated her from the rest of the family .
lucy downey was already in the pool .
that much was done for the unsub .
then this unsub is driven by some other kind of compulsion
some other need .
hotch was right . this isn &apos;t a coincidence .
it &apos;s a possible signature .
sir i know that but two families have died .
no i realize this breaks protocol but--
no all we want is to stop this from happening again .
sir i promise you agent garcia is the best we have .
ok . thank you .
we need to look at each of the victims as a hub
with lives outside of their own families .
well each one of them has their own
connections outside the family .
school friends tutors business colleagues .
and each one of these people
are considered access points back to the family .
that could take weeks .
well you have time .
from remorse to the desire to kill again
the unsub will go through a gamut of emotions .
could be another year before unsub feels the desire to kill again .
as horrific as these crimes are
this city doesn &apos;t have the resources
to commit that amount of time .
we have full access to all military records for the fathers .
well now at least
we have access to the main hub between families .
the dads .
all right well let &apos;s find out what connects them .
stand up .
you want to see don &apos;t you ?
very much .
we &apos;re gonna show you .
this is the home of the downey family .
there were 3 children .
how old are the children ?
12.9 and 4 . a girl and two boys .
where were they found ?
over there .
buried .
interesting .
laura the mother and the two boys were killed in the house .
the daughter ?
this is where the mother and the youngest son were killed .
the other boy was shot in the bedroom closet .
where &apos;s the father ?
overseas .
the killer knows this .
he knows everything about this family
and he watches their every move
to be sure he achieves what he needs .
you have no idea how he knows the father is gone
or how he targets these families
and the how.that &apos;s the key .
the how ...
is why he ...
was able to catch me .
you watched the families for days .
weeks .
i got to know them .
but not your guy . he doesn &apos;t need weeks .
if he did he &apos;d stay longer .
why ?
so he can enjoy them .
but what i don &apos;t understand--
is why he didn &apos;t separate the children .
exactly .
that way you have more control . no room for error .
why he didn &apos;t put the boys in separate rooms and say
if you cry ...
i &apos;ll have to kill mommy .
tell me ...
how did the girl die ?
she was drowned .
yet the others were shot .
may i see her ?
what &apos;s so special about the girl ?
to suffocate her .
to feel the life leave her body
means everything to the man who did this .
to you maybe but not to this killer .
not in the same way .
all i did was show them how weak fathers could be .
that &apos;s all .
every child you killed you abused physically .
for this man there is no sexual gratification .
at least i spared the fathers the grief of living .
please ...
please don &apos;t do this .
come on . let &apos;s get you cleaned up .
dani ! didn &apos;t i tell you to always lock the door !
nick cleats off !
dani ! where are you ?
dani ?
mom ?
please don &apos;t--
please ...
mom ...
the girl was suffocated not shot right ?
yes .
just like the other two .
her name is dani . she &apos;s 14 .
and the father ?
afghanistan .
does this rule out remorse ?
yes it does .
so what is it now ?
the escalation between kills
indicates a major psychological break .
how is it escalated ?
the timeframe between kills
has gone from a year to just 3 days .
for the unsub something has dramatically changed .
some kind of major external stressor forced this unsub
into feeling the need to kill again without any remorse .
mirror neurons and stressors
relating to the unsub &apos;s past
may have triggered this
the strongest of which is smell .
that sound .
the williams were killed a year ago .
were there any military maneuvers
going on at langley at that time ?
the annual air show but nothing as big as this .
he &apos;s killed again hasn &apos;t he ?
luckily for me .
luckily ?
now we &apos;re alone .
you stated that the families don &apos;t know the killer . why ?
now we wait right ? you and i
see if my ... admirer contacts me .
he will .
yours was one of the first cases i studied .
really ?
i &apos;ve been fascinated ever since .
with what ?
you .
and now ...
you want to know what i did ... to the children .
don &apos;t you ?
yes .
i can show you .
i can show you exactly what i did to them .
tell me .
children are so precious .
so clean .
but they need guidance .
especially the girls .
why ?
girls have much more to lose ... than boys .
it &apos;s a fact the female body can handle pain much better .
what did you do to them ?
i showed them
what men ...
their fathers and brothers ...
are capable of .
and what is that ?
you sure you want to know ?
yes .
morgan if the langley air show is the stressor
then karl &apos;s admirer doesn &apos;t fit the profile .
a psychopath suffering a major psychological break
doesn &apos;t brag about it hotch .
there was nothing you could have done
that would have saved that family today .
well that &apos;s if i &apos;m right about the profile .
i think you are .
karl &apos;s admirer doesn &apos;t have
anything to do with these killings .
well either way we need to know who is .
hotch i want you to stay with him and find out
so we can stop this son of a bitch .
i plan to .
once i killed the children
it always amazed me
how little ... the father fought the inevitable .
which was what ?
dying .
i &apos;m trolling through the williams &apos; emails
satellite phone calls land line phone calls
family photos their life all of it .
what about the downeys ?
they &apos;re up next and there &apos;s a ton to go through .
fingerprints garcia ?
zip .
they &apos;re--they-- there &apos;s nothing here .
i &apos;m sorry folks .
garcia widen the search .
morgan i already did . vicap combines every database
in this country . we &apos;re as wide as we can go .
abuse can have a long @-@ term effect on any child &apos;s brain
but for the abused child who has the high @-@ risk gene
and the orbital cortex damage
the combination is devastating .
all right this air show is military .
these fathers are all soldiers
fighting a war on foreign soil .
we know that none of these graves are a sign of remorse .
hey guys . look at these graves .
what are they reminiscent of ?
mass graves .
exactly . which would indicate
the unsub experienced early pubescent
3 @-@ dimentional mirror neurons
reflecting events similar to the one they &apos;re creating .
i think this unsub was born into conflict .
but where was he born into conflict ?
when was the last time we saw anything
like mass graves in the u.s. ?
we haven &apos;t . not in our lifetimes .
not within our borders .
vicap is national not international .
garcia international databases ?
interpol is the biggest .
if they did it they &apos;re in it .
it &apos;s pretty obvious that he &apos;s done this before
but the question is where and why .
karl i never thought that you &apos;d be this honest .
it takes a good woman
to make an honest man .
and anyway let &apos;s face it--
she &apos;s prettier than you .
karl do you know why you killed all those families ?
i &apos;ve already told you why .
no you told me how not why .
and the reasons why in this case
are very different than they were for you .
they &apos;re very very different .
and as you so eloquently have been
pointing out to agent prentiss
all of your motivations were about sex .
motivations you learned from your father .
you really have done your research on me
i &apos;m flattered .
you &apos;re also filled with feelings
of extreme self @-@ hatred .
it must be distracting working with someone so beautiful .
you forced those men to watch their children die
and here &apos;s why karl .
here &apos;s why you are what you are .
what i would do to you .
by killing the fathers last
you were killing your own father
and ultimately yourself
over and over again .
this isn &apos;t over agent hotchner .
at least not for you .
wait hotch .
for karl it &apos;s all about the fathers .
in this case it &apos;s all about the girls .
they die last .
they &apos;re laid out last . none of them are shot .
none of them show any signs of sexual motive .
what if we applied that logic to these killings ?
that &apos;s something we hadn &apos;t considered .
why would we ? it &apos;s so rare .
what is ?
the killer &apos;s a woman .
a woman ?
i &apos;ll let morgan know .
karl just now you said
that this wasn &apos;t over for me .
what did you mean by that ?
he &apos;s just getting warmed up .
it &apos;s just ...
you don &apos;t see it .
but you will .
all right we &apos;ll work it in right now .
prentiss thinks the unsub might be a woman .
that &apos;s why we couldn &apos;t find a sexual motive .
wherever she &apos;s from her father &apos;s a military man .
derek i &apos;ve got a hit .
interpol .
2 hits . 3 hits .
3 crime scenes . 3 different cities .
the first--zagreb 1998 .
a woman and her 8 @-@ month @-@ old baby are both killed .
and then 2 years later
the same prints show up in modena italy
then 2007 london england young couple both shot .
you were right . she &apos;s killed before .
zagreb is the capital city of croatia .
is that significant ?
between 1991 and &apos; 95 they fought
a bitter battle for independence .
serbian forces tried to ethnically cleanse
over 40.000 bosnian muslims .
then at some point within the last 2 years she moved to america .
she &apos;s on the run .
and ran right into a city
filled with military families .
the only mass graves reminiscent
of the ones the unsubs created
were found all over bosnia after the war
but none of them rival that of srebrenica .
dutch u.n. forces created a safe haven for refugees .
then in 1995 bosnian serb forces surrounded the town .
a psychopath born in the middle of that conflict--
that &apos;s not a good mix .
she &apos;s exacting her life experiences onto the victims .
you think this woman was there ?
well think about it . langley &apos;s filling up with civilians
and military vehicles just like srebrenica .
can you determine her age ?
based on victimology
each of these girls is no older than 15 .
the balkan war lasted between &apos; 93 and &apos; 95
so if the girls represent the unsub
she &apos;s somewhere in her late 20s .
how did srebrenica end ?
it was a massacre .
i don &apos;t think this woman has anything to do with karl .
i encouraged him .
i flirted with him .
made it personal .
getting intimate with a killer is ...
so different .
it &apos;s what we do .
yeah . but ...
there &apos;s no fixing how i feel right now is there ?
no .
but it helped the case .
and you did what you had to .
agent hotchner .
before you go
there &apos;s one final thing i &apos;d like to share with you .
let &apos;s just get this over with .
this unsub is armed and suffering
a major psychological break
and she will not hesitate to kill again .
she &apos;s white and in her 20s .
we believe she came to the u.s. a few years ago .
she &apos;s likely on foot .
she could be eastern european .
she may speak little to no english .
now if you manage to apprehend or corner her
do not underestimate this woman .
she will try to fight her way out .
the downeys live less than a mile from the foresters
which means she &apos;s somewhere in this area .
i see something .
wait .
wait a minute . could it be ?
they &apos;re all connected to the same site .
every media outlet is being informed
of the clear and present danger to the public .
thank you very much .
ok guys i really have got something .
all of these photos every one of them
was uploaded to a user website called photobug .
photobug ?
yeah . members can upload photos videos email
webcam chats . i use it all the time .
every one of these families extensively used this site
for months even years .
all these family photos were printed by photobug .
isn &apos;t it protected ?
not from the people who run it .
it &apos;s a great way for military families to keep in touch .
and a perfect way to target a family
without anybody &apos;s knowledge .
they outsource work to people all over the country .
so i took your profile
hacked into their employee database
came up with this list of potentials
one of which is a match that screams homicidal bitch .
her name &apos;s miranda dracar she was an orphan
born in sarajevo during 1982 .
she was adopted by a family in srebrenica .
let &apos;s go .
clear .
clear .
the foresters .
morgan .
the unsub &apos;s next victim .
he &apos;s a marine .
usmc first battalion engineer .
jennifer call your contact .
sir i &apos;m gonna need access to every piece of data
on u.s. marine sergeant young .
it may save his family .
why are you always so slow ? we &apos;re late . come on .
i am i am .
so you think you found my admirer .
a woman .
no . we found the killer .
with my help of course .
your admirer is exactly like
everyone who contacts you--lost .
my love your guy is far from lost .
we &apos;re done .
so is he .
&quot; look at what i have done . &quot;
it &apos;s quite brilliant you know ?
we will find whoever sent you that .
no agent hotchner i rather think
he &apos;s already found you .
morgan ?
i &apos;m all right .
i &apos;m all right .
hotch .
hotch .
i can &apos;t believe you can &apos;t see what he &apos;s doing .
what is going on ?
he &apos;s torturing him .
who ?
it &apos;s great to see you squirm agent hotchner .
foyet .
