gossip girl here--
your one and only source
into the scandalous lives of manhattan &apos;s elite .
of course i love you , chuck . i &apos;ve always loved you .
i love you more and more every day ,
if it &apos;s even possible to love someone that much .
this was the only car with the keys in it .
it &apos;s fine . just go .
you--you just wanna take away something that matters to me ?
did you even care about dan ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been holed up ,
trying to figure out a concept for my new book .
and it &apos;s great that they gave me a deal for a second one ,
but that means i actually have to come up
with something to write about .
i have something i think you &apos;d like to see .
charlie trout .
do i know you ?
yeah , alessandra .
we met at dan &apos;s book party .
what &apos;s it like being a book agent
and working with my good friend dan ?
if they ever found out
the truth about the real charlotte rhodes ,
they would never forgive me .
ivy ! it &apos;s charlotte rhodes from florida .
we took that acting class together .
uh , yeah . charlotte .
why was ivy dickens here anyway ?
oh , she &apos;s my friend &apos;s cousin .
her real name &apos;s charlie rhodes .
i &apos;m sorry . real name ?
i &apos;m worried there &apos;s not much time left .
mrs rhodes is up right now if you &apos;d like to talk to her .
you shouldn &apos;t have sent that video in to &quot; gossip girl . &quot;
i didn &apos;t do it .
then who did ?
i &apos;ll never tell .
x.o.x.o. gossip girl
february is the shortest month ,
but the bitter chill makes it feel the longest .
the smart ones , like me ,
escape to more tropical climates ,
while some of my upper east side friends
use the time to hunker down and finish their work .
others snuggle up in bed
with their agendas to keep them warm .
and then there are the homes
that feel even colder inside than it is out .
hello ?
you did not have to buy me a gift .
i wanted to . i hope you like it .
it &apos;s gorgeous .
it &apos;ll look even more gorgeous on you .
lunch today so i can see it ?
uh , i can &apos;t .
dan &apos;s turning in his book proposal .
he &apos;s making a big deal about it , even getting it bound .
a messenger &apos;s picking it up at 11 : 00 .
i have to read it
before it goes off to jonathan karp .
so what about after you &apos;re done ?
oh , okay . come by around 5 : 00 ?
it &apos;s a date .
dad , what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s so cold ,
i came to get my green down puffy jacket .
which is here because ...
lily hates it ,
and she &apos;d throw it out if she got her hands on it .
well , you might wanna listen to a woman with taste .
that reminds me , how &apos;s everything going with blair ?
that &apos;s a nice transition , but we haven &apos;t really spoken .
uh , i &apos;ve been busy with my book proposal ,
and she &apos;s busy ...
with , uh , her princess stuff , so , you know .
no , i don &apos;t . and you guys kissed .
which is why it &apos;s better to stay clear of her .
nothing good could come of us hanging out right now .
so if we &apos;re not gonna be more than friends ,
it &apos;s too hard to be ... just friends .
is that your proposal ?
oh , congratulations .
at least you &apos;re using your solo time to be productive .
yeah , i actually feel really good about it .
hey , would you mind waiting , uh ,
for the messenger to come pick this up ?
&apos;cause chuck invited me over ,
and i &apos;m gonna stop by on my way to the library .
he &apos;s not still mad at you
for running off with blair at the wedding ?
uh ... well , i guess neither of us
is letting our feelings for blair keep us down .
speaking of down , lily was right . that jacket is terrible .
why does everybody hate this jacket ?
i told you that i &apos;m sorry .
i @-@ i don &apos;t know what came over me .
i &apos;m not sure it even was me ,
because why would i ever kiss humphrey ?
oh , so that &apos;s your excuse-- multiple personality disorder ?
or did an alien take over your body ?
i would never do anything to hurt you .
too late .
look , it was a mistake . what do you want me to do ?
self @-@ flagellate ? wear a hair shirt ?
if you &apos;re referring to the hideous fur vest you wore yesterday ,
i &apos;m the only one that suffered
because i had to look at it .
can you pass the salt , please ?
mm , looks like we &apos;re all out .
i go get more .
and i &apos;d like some more bacon . crisp , please .
oh , why don &apos;t you just take mine ?
you don &apos;t seem to have a problem doing that .
how much longer can you go on ? !
enough ! i can &apos;t take this !
no , she didn &apos;t .
oh , yes , she did .
dorota , come on !
let us out , dorota !
you not coming out until you work this out !
i don &apos;t care if it takes all day !
don &apos;t look at me . she works for you .
i &apos;m glad you called , nate .
i &apos;m glad you said yes .
so what have you been up to since the party ?
oh , i &apos;m supposed to be doing schoolwork ,
but i &apos;m really just procrastinating .
you know , hanging out with friends
and trying to get to know the city even better .
oh , and , um ...
i friended that girl ivy-- um , charlie--
on facebook , but i never heard back from her .
yeah , well , she &apos;s in europe , so maybe that &apos;s why .
did she go with friends or just by herself ?
i don &apos;t really know .
do you not like her or something ?
no , no , i do .
i mean , she and i had this thing . it was nothing major .
but if you &apos;re asking , i thought you should know .
i &apos;m trying to be honest .
well , i appreciate that .
honesty is hard to come by these days .
not that i &apos;m one to talk .
my mom doesn &apos;t even know i live here .
oh , hey , that &apos;s my friend dan &apos;s book . are you reading it ?
oh , actually , i &apos;m performing it at the upright citizens brigade .
it &apos;s this improv group , and they have a book night
where they read excerpts from current novels .
they &apos;re doing &quot; inside &quot; tonight .
let me guess . the reading &apos;s just you guys mocking it , right ?
pretty much . but it &apos;s not bad for dan .
he should come .
you can invite him yourself . he &apos;s on his way up .
we &apos;re taking monkey for a walk .
i thought since he &apos;s the reason i &apos;m saddled with the mutt ,
he can freeze his ass , too .
so you guys are okay .
here &apos;s monkey &apos;s playdate now .
good to see you , humphrey .
is it ?
of course .
losing blair was tough on us both ,
but it &apos;s not your fault .
so you &apos;re not mad about what happened ?
because she used you as her getaway driver ?
humphrey , you two can play &quot; driving miss waldorf &quot;
as much as you want .
as for me , i &apos;m not interested
in mooning over the woman who broke my heart .
i &apos;m a sadist , not a masochist .
i think you might be on to something there .
aren &apos;t i always ?
as for monkey , i &apos;m afraid he &apos;ll have to wait .
nathaniel &apos;s new friend
would like to speak with you about &quot; inside . &quot;
i &apos;ll just put these away for now .
espresso ?
sure .
so what &apos;s this i hear about my book ?
oh , lola &apos;s performing it at a theater
with the upright citizens brigade .
have you heard of them ?
this is ridiculous . i &apos;m married .
and i haven &apos;t seen dan since valentine &apos;s day .
which proves my point . whenever you have feelings
for someone that you can &apos;t deal with , you avoid them .
i am not avoiding him . if you don &apos;t remember ,
i have a royal minder who watches my every move .
okay , well , then if you don &apos;t have feelings for him ,
then spending time with dan
shouldn &apos;t be a problem for him or you .
it isn &apos;t . and i &apos;ll prove it to you .
how ?
by hanging out with him all day .
why don &apos;t you come with me ?
i &apos;m not spending the day with you and dan .
and what would that prove anyway ?
that he and i are nothing more than old friends .
i &apos;ll point out the sadness of his hair , clothing ,
brooklyn roots , and he will decry
my constructive criticism as snobbery .
we &apos;ll share our views on recent french cinema .
and there will be no kissing !
open up !
everything fixed ?
not even close .
it will be .
now i have to gather up dan &apos;s dvds .
and you wait here and tell estee when she arrives
that i &apos;m with dan--
my friend who i &apos;m not avoiding
because he &apos;s just my friend .
send pics !
i &apos;m so psyched .
i read about the , uh , bret easton elis one a while back .
yeah , he came by the rehearsal , which was really cool .
you should come .
i mean , i &apos;m sure the other actors would love to meet you .
wow . that &apos;d be-- that &apos;d be great .
um , i just have to make a phone call ,
but , uh , my phone is dead . can i use yours ?
yeah , of course .
thanks .
so what &apos;s next ?
the worldwide musical of your book ?
uh , yeah , i was thinking mimes .
mimes can be pretty cool .
hey , nate . is everything okay ?
not really .
don &apos;t hang up .
lola ?
look , i know you &apos;re using my name .
i just don &apos;t know why .
are you in trouble ?
it &apos;s ... complicated .
but i swear , i am not doing anything to hurt you .
well , then explain it to me .
i ... i can &apos;t .
just ... just let it go , lola , please .
i &apos;m sorry .
i think the police would be really interested
in hearing about you .
you know , stealing someone &apos;s identity is a felony .
it &apos;s been so cold ,
i &apos;ve just wanted to lay low , you know ?
so i just got off the phone with the director
and i have to go in early . are you ready , dan ?
yeah . chuck , if you don &apos;t mind
taking a rain check on our dog walk ...
not at all . a cold walk with monkey
or basking in the glow
of your book success ? no @-@ brainer .
call me .
i &apos;ve been calling you for days .
why haven &apos;t you called me back ?
i &apos;m at a silent yoga retreat in upstate new york .
ah , that &apos;s funny .
you and your daughter are both in new york .
no , she isn &apos;t . she &apos;s in college .
yeah . yeah , julliard .
and apparently ,
one of her extracurricular activities
is partying at nate archibald &apos;s .
oh , and she goes by &quot; lola &quot; now .
what ? how could that happen ?
i don &apos;t know .
but you need to get her out of there
before this whole scheme blows up in your face .
i have to go , but thank you for getting back to me .
who was it ?
you haven &apos;t called the family , have you ?
i &apos;m feeling so much better . i don &apos;t want to worry them .
no , it was the pharmacy .
they forgot to deliver one of your medications .
now let &apos;s get you back to bed .
take this to humphrey &apos;s agent . same address .
careful , lonely boy .
looks like someone is finding some cold comfort
in some red @-@ hot revenge .
i need a taxi to take me to the train station .
thanks .
i &apos;ll be right back .
is everything okay ?
i &apos;m worried . miss cece &apos;s having trouble breathing .
i think we need to get her to the hospital .
okay .
then we need to go against her wishes
and tell the rest of the family .
i know she &apos;ll be mad , but it &apos;s right thing to do .
they should be with her .
i &apos;ll make arrangements for her travel
while you call your mom and aunt .
you know , i think it &apos;d be best if you call them .
i get confused with all the medical terms .
all right .
what are you doing here now ?
i couldn &apos;t wait .
oh , well , you &apos;re gonna have to .
i &apos;m just about to read dan &apos;s proposal
so we can send it on to his editor .
you should send it now ,
because what i have in mind is going to take the whole ...
afternoon .
oh , that &apos;s , um ,
that &apos;s not how the process works .
it &apos;s dan .
everyone &apos;s going to love it .
i did read an ... earlier draft , and it was in excellent shape .
i &apos;m sure
all he &apos;s done is changed a few commas here and there .
i should , um--
lock the door ?
already done .
hold all my calls
and messenger dan &apos;s proposal on to jonathan karp .
so these people are all here to perform my book ?
yeah . actually , there was a fight
over who got to play clair .
i won .
knew which prop to bring .
oh , this is our director , connor .
dan , hey , so glad that you could make it to rehearsal .
is there anything i can do ?
just be a good sport and get ready to be mocked .
well , that &apos;s my entire life , so i think i can manage that .
great .
so we &apos;re starting with the deb ball
and the destruction of the gown scene , right ?
yes , we &apos;re gonna start with that .
did that actually happen ?
no , not really ,
although charlie did steal serena &apos;s deb gown once .
oh . so you &apos;re close with charlie , too ?
sort of . we had--we had this thing . we , uh , kissed . kind of .
uh , it &apos;s weird i &apos;m even saying that .
jeez , that charlie gets around .
yeah .
um , i &apos;m just gonna take this , actually .
nate ? hey , what &apos;s up ?
you tell me . didn &apos;t your phone die ?
i charged it .
if you wanted charlie &apos;s number , you could &apos;ve just asked .
okay , you &apos;re using me to get to her . why ?
i have to go to rehearsal now , but ...
maybe if you came down here
to get a bite to eat with me between now and the performance ,
we could talk about it then ?
all right . see you then .
she &apos;s in--she &apos;s in a closed door meeting ?
all right , well , just tell alessandra i called . thank you .
humphrey ! there you are .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
oh , well , i saw you on the &quot; gossip girl &quot; &quot; spotted &quot; map ,
and i @-@ i though i &apos;d come by and drop these dvds off .
you looked me up on &quot; gossip girl &quot; ?
what &apos;s going on , blair ?
what ? nothing .
can &apos;t a friend
stop by to hang out with another friend to do ...
whatever it is we &apos;re doing here ?
we &apos;re not doing anything here .
you &apos;re gonna go home , and i &apos;m busy .
and after what happened at nate &apos;s ,
i think us being together is a recipe for disaster .
don &apos;t be silly , humphrey .
we can get past that and be friends ,
just like old times .
in fact , you know , let &apos;s take a photo of our friendship
so we can remember this moment forever .
hey ! you ... in the hideous headband .
come , take a picture !
smile !
oh ! serena should see how much fun we &apos;re having right now .
you know , that headband is giving me
hillary clinton flashbacks .
the bad kind .
oh , yeah . i would never wear it myself .
i just have it on because i &apos;m playing clair .
humphrey , these pathetic people are playing us ? i mean , really ?
the look like they work in ... a thrift store .
oh , it is so nice of you to stop by and have tea on your way back from your retreat .
i don &apos;t know how you stayed silent for that long .
i think i would probably burst .
it &apos;s challenging , but it really gives you a feeling of peace ,
especially because i miss charlie so much .
we do , too .
did she have fun while she was here ?
i heard nate had a terrific valentine &apos;s day party .
terrific for some .
uh , serena and blair are having some issues .
oh , i &apos;m sorry .
did charlie seem okay ?
she mentioned that nate might be dating someone .
uh , yeah , i think a girl named lola ,
but i don &apos;t really know what &apos;s gonna happen with that .
blair &apos;s with dan .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , sweetie .
no , believe it or not , it &apos;s actually a good thing .
what , that they &apos;re together ?
yeah , i know . as crazy as it sounds ,
it &apos;s--it &apos;s her way of apologizing .
and if she &apos;s willing
to put whatever happened between them in the past ...
i don &apos;t know . maybe i should , too .
you know what ? i &apos;m gonna go down there and talk to her .
you two have fun .
so i know you didn &apos;t just come by for tea .
what &apos;s going on ?
saved by the bell .
hello ?
she &apos;s right in here .
darling ?
darling ? please ?
come with me to the hospital .
i &apos;ll just meet you there .
no , no , please . please stay with me .
you &apos;re the only person i feel safe with .
i @-@ i won &apos;t leave you .
i promise .
dr. glassman will meet us at the hospital .
dr glassman &apos;s coming here ?
oh , no , dear .
there &apos;s a helicopter waiting for us at the east hampton airport
to take us into the city .
the rest of the family will be at the hospital within the hour .
clair &apos;s a dictator ,
and you don &apos;t even have a doorman .
for her , brooklyn is just a place
for her limo driver to pass through
on her way to j.f.k.
why do you care what she thinks ?
you don &apos;t have to stay , really .
nonsense . we &apos;re friends , and friends support each other .
friends aren &apos;t afraid to be with each other
or feel awkward together .
do you want me to hold your hand for support ?
no .
all right , everybody , let &apos;s take five .
do you , uh , do you need me right now ? please need me .
yeah .
so in the scene where clair kisses dylan ,
is that , like , a passionate kiss or is it just a sweet one ?
i &apos;ve got this one , humphrey .
first off , if you had done your homework ,
you would know the answer .
i mean , even gossip girl knows that .
who &apos;s gossip girl ?
i thought this theater company was professional .
have you never heard of research ?
log on and learn everything
you need to know about me , stat .
but you can skip my entire freshman year of college .
secondly , clair would never kiss dylan passionately ever .
if she had to kiss him at all , it would be perfunctory ,
like shaking someone &apos;s hand or petting a dog .
i @-@ i don &apos;t understand .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re listening
to the ramblings of a deranged person .
blair , go home .
are you intentionally being obtuse ?
i mean , a clair @-@ dylan kiss would mean nothing .
do you mind if i show her ?
actually , i do .
it should look like this .
hey , is everything okay ?
humphrey , you weren &apos;t supposed to kiss back . you ruined it .
yeah , you &apos;re right . this is my fault .
hey , you guys know what happened to serena ?
she just walked out of here all upset .
oh , god .
she saw us kissing again .
serena , wait !
look , it wasn &apos;t what it looked like .
please , just stop .
just even if it hurts me ,
be real with me for a second
and tell me the truth ,
that you--that you like dan .
i ...
i don &apos;t . i &apos;m ...
i &apos;m married and ...
i promised chuck i &apos;d wait for him .
and then there &apos;s the clause in the prenup .
oh , come on . we both know if you have feelings for someone ,
nothing else in the world matters .
that &apos;s not true . we &apos;re not servants to our emotions .
we can control them , suppress them ,
stomp them out like bugs .
you know , i @-@ i can &apos;t do this anymore .
i can &apos;t stand here and listen to you lie to me
and--and lie to yourself . i &apos;m done .
looks like s. and b. can &apos;t find any refuge from the nasty cold .
hey , mom , can i call you back , please ?
oh , my god .
you are trouble .
i take that as a compliment .
oh . allow me .
oh , my god .
you made me miss four calls from jonathan karp .
i wonder what &apos;s going on .
yes , it &apos;s alessandra for jonathan .
they must &apos;ve really loved dan &apos;s proposal
to call back this quickly .
jonathan , hi .
yes .
you read it ?
didn &apos;t you love it ? i mean , unexpected but it &apos;s ...
plagiarized ?
that &apos;s impossible .
you look like you have your hands full .
i &apos;ll just leave you with this .
i &apos;m sure there must be some explanation .
humphrey !
will you excuse us ?
no . no , no , p @-@ please don &apos;t go .
i &apos;m in the middle of something here .
but serena &apos;s mad at me because of the kiss ,
and i @-@ i keep telling her it doesn &apos;t mean anything but--
that &apos;s enough , blair . it &apos;s enough . really .
y @-@ you can go if you want .
no , this is all great . i can use this .
or i can go .
i really need a friend right now .
i don &apos;t want to be your friend , blair .
i want more . i want you .
and if you don &apos;t feel the same way about me ,
then i don &apos;t think we should be seeing each other anymore .
i can &apos;t believe
all the details gossip girl knows about your lives .
i know . it &apos;s scary , right ?
so are you looking up blair for your character
or charlie for your secret agenda ?
i &apos;m--i &apos;m sorry i &apos;ve been so mysterious .
it &apos;s just this really weird situation ,
and i don &apos;t want to get you wrapped up in it .
spotted--charlie rhodes entering the hospital .
here &apos;s hoping it &apos;s for a checkup
and not that she &apos;s being checked in .
oh , my god .
well , i guess i know where we &apos;re going .
hey . can you tell connor that i had to leave ?
leave ? who &apos;ll play clair ?
hey ! hey , you .
you &apos;d be amazing .
mother should be here by now .
i &apos;m gonna see if there &apos;s an update .
okay , i &apos;ll just wait here , then .
wait ! mom !
mom , is grandma okay ?
yeah , i &apos;m gonna check now .
mother ?
oh , my god . is she unconscious ?
uh , no . they just-- they have her sedated .
we--we think she has a blood clot in her lung .
it &apos;s very common with cancer and chemotherapy .
chemo ? she hasn &apos;t said a word . i mean--
we have to get ger a c.a.t. scan immediately .
her doctor &apos;s waiting for her inside .
charlie , what are you doing here ?
i , um , i just went to visit grandma and , um ...
don &apos;t be so modest , charlie .
she &apos;s been with ms rhodes for months .
she &apos;s been such a solace to her .
you &apos;ve been taking care of her ?
dr. glassman , what is-- what &apos;s going on ?
all right , well , uh , if it is a blood clot ,
then cece will need emergency surgery to remove it .
so i need you to sign some papers immediately
to approve the surgery .
okay , i &apos;ll handle it .
i &apos;ll go with you .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
look , i thought we were taking her
to a hospital in the hamptons .
charlie , the doctor wants to talk to you , too ,
since you &apos;ve been with her for the past few days .
this is not over .
looks like the heat just got turned up
on our upper east side &apos;s favorite impostor .
there you are .
i have been calling and calling .
oh , i &apos;m sorry . i @-@ i had my ringer off .
but i &apos;m glad you got my e @-@ mail
to come tonight .
i had a bunch of books sent over to sell at the front of house .
i know the lingo .
uh , but all the proceeds are going to u.c.b.
what did you think of my proposal ?
you mean the one you plagiarized ?
what are you talking about ?
the proposal you sent in was a condensed version
of a book that was already published ...
by jonathan karp .
&quot; blast off &quot; was the first book he ever edited .
yeah , yeah . i @-@ i know that book .
it &apos;s about the first crew ever to go up
in the space shuttle program .
but you know what my book is .
it &apos;s a--it &apos;s an alternative history of manhattan
as a--as a monarchy .
that &apos;s not the one you sent in .
maybe you read someone else &apos;s proposal .
yeah , i may not have technically read it .
mm , i mean , your first draft was so good .
so ...
okay , but i triple @-@ checked with the messenger company .
it came from you .
and if we can &apos;t show them this is a horrible mistake ,
they &apos;re talking about dropping you .
what ? why ?
dan , plagiarism is a serious offense .
okay , let me check my computer
and just make sure that you got the right one ,
and we &apos;ll make this go away .
house opens in five .
i have been looking for you everywhere .
i was just trying to stay out of the way ,
give you and the family some space .
which makes sense since you &apos;re not family .
you were supposed to disappear months ago .
and i meant to .
but you realized my mother was an easy target ?
no !
look , cece had been so kind to me .
i just wanted to thank her ,
and when i saw her , i realized she was sick .
my grandmother died of cancer ...
i don &apos;t wanna hear your sob story .
well , i can &apos;t leave now .
i promised cece i would stay .
besides , what would everyone think ?
well , you better hope that they don &apos;t .
i don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s--it &apos;s gone .
but you backed it up , right ?
no !
dan , is this some sort of cry for help ?
you can tell me .
no , i swear to you , i do not know what &apos;s going on .
maybe--maybe the messenger screwed up .
maybe someone &apos;s screwing with me .
who would go to such lengths to do this to you ?
that &apos;s a nice scarf .
thanks . it &apos;s a shahtoosh . it was a present .
i &apos;m gonna go back to the office and try to convince karp
this was a mistake or a practical joke .
you go home and rewrite yours as fast as you can .
when did you forget who you are ?
you wanted to be the most powerful woman in america .
&quot; not just america . &quot;
really ?
only there &apos;s nothing powerful about you right now .
ugh . you always get this way
when you &apos;re around charlie trout .
i don &apos;t know who i am without him , sabrina .
you guys are doing a really good job here ,
making fun of this .
look , i @-@ i get it . i do .
you &apos;re afraid of what people might think
if you change your mind ,
but you can &apos;t care about them .
you never used to .
you &apos;re clair carlyle .
you &apos;re in control of your own destiny ,
and most of manhattan &apos;s .
how did you get so smart ?
can &apos;t take the credit .
it &apos;s dylan .
dylan ?
we might be best friends ,
but dylan and you have something that even you and i don &apos;t have .
remember when you won that essay competition ,
and your mother was too busy
to even show up to watch you get your award ?
who came , even though you treated him so terribly ?
dan came to that ?
see , dylan &apos;s always here for you ,
even when you don &apos;t even know it .
no matter how you treat him ,
he cares about you ,
not in spite of who you are ,
but because of it .
dan loves me for me .
yes , dylan does .
oh , my gosh .
i @-@ i &apos;ve gotta go right now .
you know what ? that &apos;s-- that &apos;s not your line .
no , me . i , blair , have to go .
any updates ?
ah . god . well , they &apos;re prepping her for surgery .
apparently , her cancer , which we didn &apos;t know had returned ,
was responding well to chemo ,
but then this--is just such a nightmare .
mom ?
what are you doing here ?
i &apos;m sorry . who are you looking for ?
wait . lola ?
you know her ?
mom , what &apos;s going on ?
carol , what is this girl talking about ?
do you know her ?
yes . yes .
she &apos;s , uh ...
my daughter .
what ?
well , then who are you ?
uh @-@ oh , ivy . do you feel the chill permeating the air ?
that &apos;s the upper east side turning their backs on you
and tossing you out into the cold .
carol , i don &apos;t understand .
why did you introduce this girl as your daughter ?
who is she ?
ivy dickens .
yeah . we--we know that story .
oh , my god . so max was telling the truth .
ivy , don &apos;t say a word .
your mom hired me to be you .
why would you do that ?
to protect you .
i was supposed to gain access to your trust fund
for your mother , which i did ,
and then i went back to my own life ,
then i ran into you in l.a ...
oh , so then you came back to new york with me .
yeah .
so when my private investigator found lola ,
it was the real charlotte rhodes .
so you did all of this for money ?
you hid an entire family from me for money ?
you don &apos;t know these people ,
what they &apos;re capable of .
i @-@ i spent my entire life running from them for you .
yes , running from people who would take in your fake daughter
as our own . we must be monsters .
lily , rufus , and serena , i understand that you &apos;re mad .
look , i &apos;m sorry .
charlie ... don &apos;t .
why would you do this to me ?
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
you switched the proposal .
when i saw the shahtoosh scarf on alessandra , i knew .
i thought that was a nice touch .
i &apos;m impressed you know the value of quality .
you &apos;ve learned so much from me in such a short period of time .
mm , you wanted me to know it was you .
you can &apos;t prove anything .
i can &apos;t , but when jonathan karp sees my real proposal ...
would that be before or after &quot; page six &quot;
exposes dan humphrey for the plagiarist he is ?
whether it &apos;s true or not , you will be tainted ,
and your publisher will drop you for good .
you see , you can &apos;t win against me , humphrey .
you can &apos;t even compete .
so this is about blair .
well , then i guess i &apos;m not competing .
i must be winning .
you wouldn &apos;t be trying this hard
if i didn &apos;t have a real shot with her .
and up until this moment , i wasn &apos;t sure if i did .
so thank you .
now , uh , if you &apos;ll excuse me ,
i , uh , i have better things to do .
why did you come back to new york with me ?
you didn &apos;t have to .
and as i remember it , you didn &apos;t even want to .
i never really had a family .
you were so good to me ,
like a big sister i never had .
i really care about you guys .
oh , you care about us or the money ?
i suppose it was your idea
to keep my grandma &apos;s relapse a secret
so you could be the only one there for her
when no one else was .
look , i begged her to call you .
she just didn &apos;t wanna worry you guys .
you know what ? this is a family matter , okay ?
so you need to leave now .
no , i promised cece that i would stay with her .
i &apos;m not leaving .
you &apos;re nothing to her-- a stranger , a nobody ,
so get outta here before i call the cops .
charlie !
i go by &quot; lola &quot; now .
&quot; lola &quot; ? i guess there have been a few things
you &apos;ve been hiding from me as well .
not an entire family .
my whole life ,
you told me it was just us .
what is so terrible about those people
that you didn &apos;t want me to know them ?
or is it that you didn &apos;t think i deserved to know them ?
of course not .
i love you ! everything ...
everything i have done is to protect you ,
to--to protect us .
after today , there is no us .
i don &apos;t want anything to do with you .
you don &apos;t mean that .
i do .
the most painful rejection
always comes from those you love the most ...
bye , mother .
and that one has to hurt .
thank you for telling me about cece .
i &apos;m a little afraid to go in .
serena &apos;s so mad .
serena doesn &apos;t have anything to be mad about .
you said so yourself .
well , maybe she does .
maybe she was right .
about what ?
about me denying that i had feelings for you .
i came to see you today to prove
that i &apos;m not in denial .
one of my specialties-- warped logic .
it is a unique skill you have .
it &apos;s awful .
no , it &apos;s not awful . it &apos;s you .
it couldn &apos;t be awful .
humphrey ...
how can this happen ?
the prenup and chuck , serena .
well , whatever this is , it will have to wait .
what if i don &apos;t want to ?
i &apos;m gonna go head in and see my dad .
so it seems you were right .
i do have feelings for dan .
i &apos;m sorry .
you don &apos;t have to be .
but i won &apos;t see him .
not because i &apos;m in denial ,
but because i care too much about your friendship .
you come first .
you &apos;re my family .
look , this isn &apos;t gonna be easy for me ,
but at least you &apos;re being honest .
and if our friendship is real , which i know it is ,
then we can get through this .
you two are gonna face a lot of obstacles ,
but i &apos;m not gonna be one of them .
i don &apos;t wanna get in the way of you and dan .
i &apos;m really glad you &apos;re here , though .
i need you .
so i guess we &apos;re cousins .
i guess so .
look , if you ever wanna get coffee or something ,
i &apos;d love to get to know you .
yeah . um ...
up until ten minutes ago ,
i didn &apos;t even know i had a family , so ...
forgive me if i &apos;m not really interested
in &quot; coffee or something . &quot;
what do you mean that cater girl is your cousin ?
oh , there &apos;s a lot going on here .
you ready to face the mayhem ?
i need to make a phone call first .
okay .
chuck ,
stop trying to hurt dan .
if you wanna be mad at anybody , be mad at me .
i could never be mad at you .
it &apos;s nice to hear you say that , really , but ...
being a good person isn &apos;t just being good to me .
dan has done nothing to you but be a friend .
you made it seem like you wanted me to wait for you .
was that a lie ?
no .
did your feelings change ?
no .
i don &apos;t know .
but whatever happens ,
don &apos;t punish dan for my confusion .
i @-@ i need some time to figure some things out , and ...
if you target him , then it &apos;ll just push us closer together ,
and i know you &apos;re too smart for that .
you &apos;re better than that , so please .
blair , don &apos;t ...
i @-@ i gotta go .
as we wait for spring to come ,
we desperately look for the signs
that the harsh winter is coming to an end .
hello ?
i &apos;m about to send you something . check your e @-@ mail .
and the signs are clear--
a ray of sunlight that cuts through the darkness .
thanks for waiting for me .
of course . did you find charlie ?
yeah .
are you okay ?
i don &apos;t know . um ...
i just really have to get out of here .
oh , well , let me get you home .
i don &apos;t really wanna be alone .
can i stay with you ?
yeah .
the bud of a new relationship
popping through the frosty ground .
hey , alessandra just called .
chuck sent over my real proposal .
really ?
yeah , she thinks she can salvage this .
that &apos;s great , dan .
yeah , wonder what made him change his mind .
i &apos;m gonna head home .
want anything ?
i &apos;m okay . thank you .
i &apos;m gonna stay .
serena needs me .
a sudden spike in temperatures ...
but don &apos;t you forget , upper east siders ,
february isn &apos;t the end of winter in this town .
there &apos;s still a long way to go .
turns out tropical islands are boring ,
and the lack of scandal is getting to me .
so i &apos;ve decided to turn up the heat from afar .
i have a certain e @-@ mail from lonely boy
that will make chuck bass &apos; blood boil .
of course i love you , chuck .
i &apos;ve always loved you .
i love you more and more every day ,
if it &apos;s even possible to love someone that much .
humphrey , you bastard .
but if you think winter &apos;s over ,
think again .
there &apos;s sure to be another cold snap ...
and sadly , some won &apos;t survive the winter .
i don &apos;t have good news .
cece had a stroke as we were preparing her for surgery .
there &apos;s nothing we can do .
you need to go in and say your good @-@ byes .
so come out of the cold , my upper east siders ...
and into the cozy warmth of my home .
my doors are always open .
