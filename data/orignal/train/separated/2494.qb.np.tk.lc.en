halloween does not kick thanksgiving &apos;s ass
3 days without an accident
d &apos;oh !
on the twelfth day of christmas
my true love gave to me
12 grampas grumbling
11 barneys belching
ten lennys leaping
nine carls dancing
eight moes a @-@ milking
seven selmas smoking
six flanders praying
five golden frinks
four crawling nerds
three @-@ eyed fish
two special ralphs
and a maggie in a snugglie .
upcoming pranks
so , what prank are you going to lead off with ?
the exploding pen .
don &apos;t think i &apos;ve heard of it .
let the games begin .
staff meeting
n2o co2
faculty parking
simpson , that is a rebuilt yugoslavian engine .
there isn &apos;t even a yugoslavia anymore !
bring it back at once !
you &apos;re the boss .
stupid punishment .
i hate hard work , unless it &apos;s on pranks .
shiny enough to see skinner &apos;s ugly face .
come with me .
i &apos;ll grill your cheese yet , boy .
you weren &apos;t the first prankster to destroy
the car i rent from mother , and you won &apos;t be the last .
&quot; rent &quot; ?
rent to own .
just 35 more payments , and it &apos;s halfway mine .
the point is , i &apos;ve seen hooligans like you come and go .
you &apos;re all just a big blur of short pants
and sinister smiles .
well , maybe so , but i &apos;m the best .
the best of your era , maybe .
are you saying there was a kid who was worse than me ?
way worse .
anyway , think no more about it .
you &apos;re dismissed .
wait ! wait ! if there &apos;s someone worse ,
i have to know who he is .
&quot; he &quot; ?
it &apos;s a she ?
just kidding , it &apos;s a guy .
but let &apos;s not dwell on a mysterious figure
from the past who was your superior in every way .
out you go .
milhouse , there was a guy who pulled
even bigger pranks than me !
wow ! imagine his sidekick .
man , if he lost that giant inhaler ,
he &apos;d really be in trouble with his parents .
diaper dandies
tubs are for bath time and water @-@ splashy fun
but there &apos;s one thing that must never be done
poop in the tub
poop in the tub
i &apos;m not gonna poop in the tub .
okay , everyone !
snack time !
i &apos;ve got milk and cookies .
hydroxeos ? !
marge , how could you ? !
those cookies are full of high fructose corn syrup
and partially hydrogenated oils .
have you even read the books i &apos;ve read ?
but this is from the kwik @-@ e @-@ mart .
you and your husband work there .
i would sooner pour the polluted water of the ganges
down their gullets than give them this carton
of cow cancer you call &quot; milk . &quot;
sorry . i didn &apos;t know .
marge , until you start serving healthy food ,
the midday mommies are pulling you from snack rotation .
hydrogenated , ugh !
daily fourth grandian
man on moon , gum in urinal
a prankster that awesome
must &apos;ve made the school paper .
nerd stands up to bully
hmm . lis ,
i just discovered something weird .
ten years ago , this paper didn &apos;t publish
for two whole weeks .
october 15 october 29
now , before the gap , look at skinner .
cool principal uses ping pong to teach angles
and here he is after the gap .
sit quietly
hmm , something must &apos;ve happened during those two weeks
to turn skinner from cool to , as you would say , &quot; tool . &quot;
the ultimate prank .
a prank that changed skinner from cool to tool .
is that a backhoe behind him ?
it is !
zoom in and enhance . mm .
willie !
he must know the answer .
before you go , can you distribute
these newspapers throughout the school ?
well , i &apos;d be a pretty lousy brother if i didn &apos;t .
willie , i know you witnessed
the most awesome prank since creation .
can you tell me about it ?
i &apos;ll nae speak to ye
of those dark times , bart simpson .
but if there was a more awesome dude than i ,
i &apos;ve got to know who he was , what he did
and how many days detention he got .
something happened .
something that changed skinner and you .
i haven &apos;t changed !
i &apos;ve always been swim teacher willie
and i always will be !
see , oh ...
all right , i &apos;ll tell ya .
years ago , this school had a pool .
i was an eager , young swim coach , teaching american youth
the revolutionary aberdeen crawl .
it was a talented group , and we were
all set to go to the state finals .
i shaved and waxed the boys myself .
then came the night of the wigglers .
what an awesome day !
yo , skin @-@ man ! little help ?
right back at you , jason .
stay in school .
i will .
i am so stoked for my daily swim .
had he stopped whistlin &apos; and looked down ,
the world wouldn &apos;t have changed that night .
but he didn &apos;t , and it did .
worms !
he spent all weekend in that crypt
full of creepy @-@ crawlies .
monday was teacher development day ,
so skinner wasn &apos;t rescued till tuesday morn .
and by then , he was the twisted monster you see today .
shut this pool down , groundskeeper willie .
willie . bart.
monster .
so my ass isn &apos;t the baddest
in the history of this school !
who did it , willie ?
his name is andy hamilton .
andy hamilton .
but whatever you do ,
never tell me where you learned his name ,
i &apos;d kill whoever told you
marge , what are you doing ?
this junk food has got to go .
it &apos;s full of chemicals , trans fats
and hard @-@ pore corn .
no !
don &apos;t worry , my sweets !
i &apos;ll put out the fire !
homie , no !
that topping is a petroleum by @-@ product !
&quot; andy hamilton , 53 hyperion drive . &quot;
bart , it &apos;s not always a good idea
to meet your hero .
i once followed santa home from the department store ,
and what i saw wasn &apos;t pretty .
i can &apos;t live my life , knowing there might be
someone better than me at the one thing i &apos;m good at .
entr ? and partay !
krazy glue !
bart , you &apos;ve been pranked !
eh , it needs a topper .
and look , some idiot left glue loosener
just lying around !
ah ! here it comes .
ay , caramba !
man , it is an honor
to meet the guy who wormed skinner .
you know , when i was your age ,
we couldn &apos;t film our pranks for youtube .
it was local news or nothing .
potato chip ?
hmm , wait a minute .
are there spring snakes in this can ?
no , no @-@ no , no @-@ no , no @-@ no . give me some credit .
it &apos;s a real snake .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s defanged .
although he can still rub poison on you with his gums .
i would really wash that arm if i were you .
can i go home now ?
you should probably wait .
you &apos;re going to be very sleepy for the next few hours .
isn &apos;t this the best day of your life ?
so , you want to be
springfield elementary &apos;s next andy hamilton ?
then you &apos;ll have to top these awesome pranks .
the bear traps in gym class .
the fire in the drinking fountain .
and , of course , the fake heart attack
on an international flight .
they had to land the plane in nairobi !
some chick missed her own wedding !
i am impressed .
oh , andy has the perfect life .
all he does is reminisce about his pranks .
and when his mom gets home from work ,
she makes him whatever sandwich he wants .
this andy sounds like kind of a loser .
how could someone so much like me be a loser ?
loser !
would a loser have showed me
how to put printer &apos;s ink in a bottle of shampoo ?
i &apos;ve never felt so clean !
a loo @-@ oo @-@ ooser !
yeah , but ...
dad , lisa &apos;s making me see things from both sides again !
lisa , i warned you about that !
shouldn &apos;t bart have all the information he needs
to make an informed decision ?
well , you ...
now you &apos;re doing it to me !
mom , what would you do
if someone you cared about might be a loser ,
but they thought they were awesome ?
are you talking about your father ?
that loser ? no .
i &apos;m talking about this guy who &apos;s 19 and never really grew up .
well , when you care about someone ,
it &apos;s not out of line to give them a gentle push
in the right direction .
got it . did you wash those carrots ?
no .
you could have washed them after you cut them ,
but now they &apos;re done for .
well , i don &apos;t like the looks of this place , marge .
i don &apos;t see any standees for chips , standees for soda .
i don &apos;t see any standees at all !
from now on , our family is eating healthy food
that looks bad on the shelf , but good in our colon .
why is that man carrying a purse ?
that &apos;s a reusable grocery bag .
this store doesn &apos;t use plastic bags ,
because they end up in the ocean
and upset jellyfish mating rituals .
stupid horny jellyfish-- neutering our dudes .
almond butter , soy milk ,
non @-@ soy dairy @-@ based soy sauce ,
steel @-@ cut spelt husk ,
chef soy @-@ ar @-@ dee soy @-@ based spaghetti and soy balls ,
free @-@ range gluten ,
ultra @-@ vegan invisible cheese ...
you know , you don &apos;t have
to read the items aloud .
i know what they are .
okay , that comes to $ 790 .
800 bucks ? !
oh , wait . i didn &apos;t see these blueberries .
$ 830 .
fine , but we &apos;re going
to a regular grocery store next week .
a week ?
without preservatives , this food won &apos;t last a day .
look .
well , i guess , uh , they can go either way .
god !
i &apos;m in horrible pain !
andy , man , is this the way
you want to spend the rest of your life ?
having to borrow spray paint from a ten @-@ year @-@ old kid ?
i told you , okay ?
i &apos;ll pay you back when i get my allowance .
i mean , not this one , but the one after next .
oh , god , you &apos;re right .
look , i think i can get you a job .
krusty owes me a favor
after i perjured myself for him during a deposition .
you would get me a job ? thank you , man .
um , i would keep that on for the interview .
hey , hey , if it isn &apos;t my old friend ... you !
krusty , i need a favor .
for you kid , anything ,
anything at all !
although i won &apos;t read screenplays .
that &apos;s for your protection .
oh , and you can &apos;t ride on my private jet .
and i won &apos;t give a struggling young comic his first chance ,
i won &apos;t give a broken @-@ down hack his last chance ,
i won &apos;t buy you kids booze .
the judge was very clear on that .
now , what can i do for you ?
oh , and i don &apos;t sign footballs unless you &apos;re dying ,
and it reverts back to me after six months if you &apos;re not dead .
as my new second assistant ,
you &apos;ve got to drive me from my office to the stage ,
and if you see anybody i &apos;ve screwed over on the way ,
avoid them !
ex @-@ wife !
former writing partner !
bookie !
dog i abandoned ! a.a. sponsor !
love child !
tiddly . wink .
tiddly .
wink . didn &apos;t andy start work today ?
yes . tiddly .
then why is he standing in our driveway ?
wink .
you &apos;re supposed to be at work !
i tried , man , but he was , like , &quot; do this thing . &quot;
and i &apos;m , like , &quot; why , dude ? &quot;
and he &apos;s , like , &quot; i &apos;m your boss ! &quot;
and i &apos;m , like , &quot; i quit . &quot;
then you &apos;re , like , &quot; you &apos;re supposed to be at work , man . &quot;
then i &apos;m , like , &quot; what ? &quot;
you quit after one day ?
yeah .
but today wasn &apos;t a total loss .
on the way home , i got this--
an ice cube with a fly in it .
if that was in your drink ,
you &apos;d be , like , &quot; i &apos;m not drinking that ! &quot;
i stuck my neck out for you , and you screwed it up !
we &apos;re not losers !
no , you two are winners .
big winners .
when i grow up ,
i want to marry a big winner like you guys .
shut up !
doggies and kitties don &apos;t last forever
but they do a lot better than fish !
flush , flush , fish , fish , fish , flush ...
it &apos;s healthy snack time !
is it ?
we &apos;ve got sulfite @-@ free grape juice
and homemade , organic , non @-@ gluten ,
fair @-@ trade zucchini cupcakes !
they don &apos;t rise by themselves ,
so i was up all night
blowing air bubbles into them with a straw .
mmm ! delicious !
what percent milk fat unsalted butter did you use
to grease the cupcake tray ?
none percent .
i used a nonstick pan .
don &apos;t you know that nonstick pans are made with p.f.o.a.s. ?
oh , boy , here it comes .
there is only one thing more
dangerous than pfoas marge
plastics made with b.p.a.s.
never , ever let your child near
any product with the number
seven !
good lord , they &apos;ve been sucking seven ! oh !
all right , andy .
it was not easy to get your job back .
you did me a solid , man .
and i promise you , i will not leave this job
unless i flake or it becomes bogus .
no , that &apos;s not good enough .
i want you to shake my hand as a fellow prankster
and swear you will try your best .
psych ! psych !
we have a deal .
marge ?
sorry i &apos;m late . i was working overtime ,
so we &apos;d have extra money to buy fruit salad .
honey , what are you doing ? hmm ?
nothing !

i know , i know .
i &apos;ve eaten your trans fats ,
your red dye number two .
even this !
oh , marge , i &apos;m seeing
a brand @-@ new side of you-- me .
more lard glug , my sweet ?
i never want to stop .
did you know that lard glug
contains neither lard nor glug ?
from now on ,
we &apos;ll only make the kids eat healthy .
i can &apos;t believe andy &apos;s lasted a week .
yeah , to congratulate him ,
i got him the most grow up thing i can think of
a caesar salad .
excuse me , i &apos;m looking for stage 6 .
i &apos;ve got a delivery for a mr. andy hamilton .
right over there. oh , thank you .
louie , have you seen andy ?
i think he &apos;s gonna ruin the show !
eh , he &apos;s about 20 seasons too late .
now , to dive in this pool
of clear , blue water .
put me down !
you &apos;re ruining the bit !
no ! i won &apos;t see you end up
like skinner , twisted and deranged .
watch the krusty show , they tell me .
you &apos;ll forget your troubles , they tell me .
uh , how much do you weigh ?
oh , 180 , maybe 190 .
plus i &apos;m wearing about 30 pounds of pancake makeup
and i &apos;m always packing heat .
plus the owner &apos;s manual for my cadillac .
i wanted warm water , not worm water .
what &apos;s going on ?
krusty needed a bit .
and i got a great one .
thanks to my new head writer , andy hamilton .
bart , thank you for believing i could grow up .
my pranking days are over , for good .
