This is amazing.
You cannot go into business with these people.
They are looking out for me.
You will regret this.
This is...war.
Good luck on the big move with Margaux.
I'm not so sure that's gonna happen anymore.
I don't think we're gonna make it.
I have everything handled. There won't be any fallout.
You recorded our conversations.
I control you.
How do you know my father?
He came to me with the story about planting that bomb.
The second I gave Pascal that story,
I knew I'd made a mistake.
He killed your father.
We need you to come forward.
I'll do whatever you need.
Pascal has already paid a visit to Mr. Chapman.
You're next unless I run interference for you.
None of this was chance.
It was Emily. It's revenge...
For David.
A revolution begins when the desires of many
are addressed by the actions of one.
It's a ripple of change
that starts when the first stone is cast at those in power
and only ends when one side lies defeated...
Or if two sides become one.
Since our last meeting, you seem to be avoiding me,
Mr. Mathis.
I'll let you know when I have what you need.
Oh, well, when will that be?
'Cause as I do my part to keep Pascal on his heels
by besting him in business,
you seem more interested in abandoned midtown buildings
than the task at hand.
Well, I have other interests that don't involve you.
Not right now you don't.
Or were the photographs of Oscar's dead body
not enough to compel you?
If you're so eager,
why don't you take care of Pascal yourself?
I don't even get my hands dirty when driving.
You have one day
before I alert Pascal to your presence.
Unless, like Oscar Chapman,
you want to flee and life your life as a woman.
You're certainly acting like one.
I'm beginning to understand
why Emily went through with that wedding.
What happened on the honeymoon boat was to be my downfall.
I can only imagine what her next desperate attempt will be.
I won't give her that chance.
I told you I don't want you involved with her in any way.
I agree.
There is something I would like to ask you.
Actually, I should have asked you this a long time ago.
Will you marry me?
Would you like to be my wife?
Yes, Pascal.
Yes!
Yes?
Yes.
What about Rebecca Devereaux?
Zbornak? Nylund.
I just want you to be golden, girl.
Get serious, Nolan.
I'm trying to give you time to reconsider
since taking Conrad down like this is a huge risk.
It won't be if we're prepared.
I cannot believe that Daniel got Javier to mac-stab me.
Have you seen the guest list for the Myclone launch tomorrow?
Hey. You're late. Is the space ready?
No, I had to find a new one
as Conrad cornered me at the original location...
and gave me an ultimatum --
Take care of Pascal, or he'll reveal me.
Then let's take control of the situation.
What shall we do with the day?
There's a beautiful vineyard at the North Fork
I've been wanting to visit.
Mm-hmm. I have a meeting in the city.
But after that, I'm all yours.
Take it easy, you crazy kids.
I still can't believe you're engaged.
Oh, yes. I believe it.
Where are you thinking of holding the ceremony?
He won't tell me, but I think it's Corsica.
It is Corsica, right?
I won't tell you.
Hey, all goes well with the myclone debut tomorrow,
we'll build you a chateaux there with the profits.
I'm impressed, Daniel.
Your program is perfect for Lemarchal's expansion into social media.
Great job.
Margaux, your father tells me that he has big plans for you.
Oh, at least he has told the news to someone.
I spoke to Gideon this morning.
He still thinks he's in line for your job.
Patience, sweetheart. Patience.
It's not like I'm stepping down tomorrow.
Okay, here's...
to things worth the wait.
Thank you.
Come with me, LeMarchal.
Who are you?
The man who's detaining you.
Miss Thorne.
No. Agent Rebecca Stone, Homeland Security.
This is where you tell me everything.
For three years now, I've been undercover
building a case against the Graysons --
Money laundering, murder...
Terrorism.
And you have the information that I need to close my case.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
Under Section 412 of the Patriot Act,
I'm under no legal obligation to provide you with counsel.
I always knew you were up to something.
The feeling's mutual.
So why don't you make this easy on yourself?
What do you have on the Graysons?
I have nothing to say.
Ill-advised.
But fine. I'll start with your phone.
Mom?
Charlotte? What's wrong?
Some freak just sent me this.
"You're so much like your namesake, it's almost haunting.
"And I know I said this before,
but the day you became a Clarke was one of my proudest moments."
There's no signature.
And what what does that mean -- "I said this before"?
I haven't the foggiest. Someone who's trying to scare you?
I don't know, Mom.
Amanda once showed me some journals that David wrote.
And the handwriting is similar.
Is there any chance David is still alive?
Charlotte...
History has proved that there are always people out there
who enjoy haunting this family
with the specter of David Clarke.
But that letter seems so sincere.
Darling, don't let your imagination run wild...
Especially when there are far lovelier things to think about.
You're engaged.
That was fast.
I hope one day your heart knows such certainty.
Oh, sweetie.
Congratulations.
So you see why we shouldn't let anything rattle us?
Give me that. I'll get rid of it.
No.
I don't want you to spend another second
with such an evil prank.
Dude has ice in his veins.
I guess that's why he had no trouble
shooting Oscar at point-blank range.
That's something that we have to carry, too, Nolan.
Neither of you pulled that trigger.
Pascal's the one who has to pay.
Well, everything's loaded. Now what?
Access any audio or video from the last few days,
since that's when Conrad contacted me.
Once Pascal rolls on Conrad, Conrad will roll on Victoria.
We'll have them dead their rights. There.
I have everything handled. There won't be any fallout.
Just stay calm, and it'll all be fine.
But they are in big trouble.
Daniel and Gideon are kids.
Trust me -- the last thing Prince Rainier wants
is to alienate the Graysons and the LeMarchals
over a raided wet bar.
Damn it. This has nothing to do with Flight 197.
Pascal was bluffing.
Conrad doesn't know that.
I need you to get me something.
You here for your sour grapes?
Mm, no, I heard the news.
You know, I thought that your imminent departure
would bring me solace.
But oddly, there's another sensation
kicking around inside of me.
A burst appendix, I hope.
No, something far more concerning.
It's a bizarre impulse to protect you.
You know, it seems as if your mission
is to stop by weekly like the gardener
to convince me that Pascal is a weed.
If I didn't know better,
I would think that you were still in love with me.
And I was once, Victoria.
As Pascal is now.
Is he?
After trying to force my compliance to his demands,
he needs to make certain that you are legally incapable
of corroborating my testimony about him.
I assure you that is not the case.
Why don't you ask Oscar Chapman?
'cause he's the man your fiance Killed in the city yesterday
To save his own skin.
Or did he not tell you that before he proposed?
If you ever set foot in this house again,
I will have you arrested for trespassing.
Oh, from what I hear, you won't be around to make that happen.
You will make a beautiful bride, Victoria.
I only wish the vows of matrimony
didn't lead once more to your being a miserable wife.
Did Margaux send you for her stuff?
'cause I haven't boxed it up yet.
No.
But, Jack, I am so sorry.
I never meant for that to happen.
Yeah, well, it had to...
With or without your brother's meddling.
What brings you by?
You're gonna think I'm crazy.
Who wrote this?
I have a guess.
It can't be David.
Well, Amanda had some journals with his handwriting,
So it can't hurt to check, right?
Charlotte, your father is dead.
This is obviously just some jerk messing with your head.
Yeah, my mother said the same thing.
And then I found these in her vanity ...
Two more letters.
Why would she hide them and then lie to my face about it?
Who knows why she does anything?
Please, can I just see the journals?
I don't know what Amanda showed you, but I don't have anything.
Then I guess I'll have to confront my mom about it,
Because... I just have this feeling.
Hang on.
I think I can help you.
It's a shame we never got to play poker.
I would have known you were bluffing.
But Conrad obviously took the bait.
Which means you have nothing.
Except an exact timeline of your guilt.
Your initial investment in Grayson Global.
You made millions off of that bombing just like Conrad.
What do you do to protect it?
You kill Trevor Mathis.
We have confirmation that you wrote that.
Wrote what? Some meaningless letters?
Not to Oscar Chapman.
But, of course...
You know that.
You killed him to keep him from talking.
Well... it's circumstantial.
It's enough to detain you indefinitely!
Maybe Margaux will be a little bit more forthcoming.
Margaux knows nothing.
Oh, really?
She's been digging around for information on flight 197
Since she got here.
Either you cooperate, or I'm going after her.
What do you want, huh?
What I've wanted from the beginning ...
The Graysons.
You'll wear this wire to the myclone launch...
Where I will watch your every move
Until you get a confession from Conrad and Victoria,
At which point, in return,
You'll leave this country a free man.
I'll give you Conrad. No problem.
We need victoria, too.
No.
All right.
I'll give you Victoria.
But you breathe a word of this to her, and, I swear to god,
You will never again see the light of day.
What should I do if plans change?
Call this number.
Otherwise, my associate will pick you up outside your office
30 minutes before the launch and prep you.
Understand?
Good.
How was your meeting in the city?
waste of time.
Were these the same people you met the other afternoon?
Why all the questions?
I'm just asking you about your day.
I've had it with this country.
And I'm needed back in Paris.
We leave tomorrow night after the event.
Is there something on your mind, Pascal?
I'm gonna take a shower.
And then maybe... we can discuss flights.
You've reached the office of Agent Rebecca Stone,
Homeland Security.
Please leave a message.
Once he's wired, tell him to get Conrad into the V.I.P suite
where it'll be quiet.
After Pascal gets a confession,
I'll bring him back down to you.
All those years thinking my father had killed himself,
only to be that close to Pascal today.
I know.
But just imagine his shock
when he figures out he's been played.
You know restraint is not my strong suit.
As of tomorrow night, he's all yours.
Do whatever you want with him.
I think Pascal is talking to Homeland Security.
What? Where is he now?
He said he had more business to do in the city
and that he would meet me at your launch tomorrow
and, after that, we would leave the country.
Sounds like he has something planned.
I wonder if my ruse with my friend at Interpol
accidentally tipped the feds off.
Your ruse at Interpol? What are you talking about?
I needed my magazine back,
so I had him threaten Pascal, okay?
In doing so, you may have put Pascal in an untenable position!
I'm not the bad guy here!
I put such faith in him.
I can't believe that he would talk to the authorities
without telling me.
Is he using me?
No.
I mean, I'm sure he'd never betray you.
Besides, the only person he has to offer up is dad, right?
And you really think that Pascal's gonna come through?
Ah, so help me, but...
I think he is actually motivated by a love for Victoria,
which only confirms that I will never understand the French.
Yeah. I learned that the hard way.
I'm so sorry about Margaux.
It's better now than later, I guess.
Well, at least you brought Charlotte back into the fold.
Yeah, well, think of it as my way of mending fences
and of not losing every woman in my life to Daniel Grayson.
Anything?
Digital stamp from a local post office
leaves more footprints than the pony express.
And this one tracks to...
Kurt Renner?
Lives in a cabin in the middle of the Berkshires.
That's great, Nolan. Thank you.
Seriously? You're not gonna tell me what this is about?
Trust me. It's...
It's not worth your time.
Daniel!
We've got a problem.
Pascal has been talking to the feds.
Desperate man taking desperate measures.
Must have got himself snared for his most recent crime.
So he's trying to save his neck.
But with what?
Well, for starters, evidence he has on me
that I've tried unsuccessfully to retrieve.
But if I'm still a free man, it's obviously not enough.
You coming to the launch tomorrow night?
Well, seeing as I now have sizable media holdings,
it wouldn't do to miss it.
I think that's where Pascal plans to drop the hammer.
I've arranged for my friend over at Interpol to be standing by
to extradite him back to France for cooking "Voulez's" books.
Oh, and you need me to get him to the airport
because you can't absent yourself from your own event.
Well, if he's gunning for you,
he'll have to follow wherever you go.
I mean, the suits over at Homeland Security
won't be prepared for that.
Uh, you know, this won't sit well with your mother.
She's gonna accuse you of betraying her.
Please. She was the one who was foolish enough to trust him.
Besides, there's many upsides to getting rid of Pascal.
Everything set for the launch tonight?
First, my father says a few words,
and then we hand over the program to Javier.
I, uh -- I know it's Pascal's company, but...
this was our acquisition.
What -- you don't think he should speak?
Well, I just think it's a good time
to establish a precedent by letting you lead.
And to that point, I know he promised you his job,
but you should get it in writing.
Why?
Do you know something I don't?
Well, just that my mother said he wants to leave tonight
on the first of many vacations with her.
If Pascal stops running the day-to-day at Lemarchal,
it could create a power vacuum back in Paris.
Where Gideon can sweep in and take advantage.
Yeah, Margaux...
we are about to launch a product
that will fundamentally alter the landscape of this company.
So why shouldn't your father commit to you
before your brother has a chance to change his mind?
Hello?
Are you sure this is the right address?
County registrar's office said there's no Kurt Renner
or anyone living here.
Well, someone does.
Someone who obviously wants to keep their identity hidden.
Don't jump to any conclusions.
I'm trying not to, but it's hard.
Charlotte...
David Clarke died in front of 100 inmates.
And even if they were all wrong,
why would he wait until now to reach out to his daughter?
Maybe he was afraid.
This is the same stationary used in those letters.
Yeah, but the rest is research.
David knew all this information.
He wouldn't need to do any of this.
So, this really is just some sicko trying to mess with me.
I'm sorry.
Let's go before he comes home.
So, it is true. You're leaving tonight?
Yes. My business here is done.
Yours, yes, but not mine.
You've been looking for a foothold
into social networking for years.
Myclone will be that for our company.
I'm glad you saw its potential.
What are you getting at, Margaux?
Well, you say that I am the next generation of Lemarchal media.
But yet I fear that once you're home,
Gideon will do anything to sway you.
Don't worry. My mind is made up.
Well, then, put it in writing --
a formal contract making me the next C.E.O.
All right.
I'll have the papers drawn up.
Thank you, papa.
Let's have a drink at the Rutherford before the event
to celebrate.
I have things to do.
Sure.
But I love you, sweetheart.
And I know you'll do a great job.
Nolan Ross.
Your name's not on the list.
How about on the hardware?
I'd say that makes me a permanent plus-one.
Oh, millennials.
If only he understood how well I know this guest list.
Surprised to see you at my party.
I am still the master of this universe.
So if you want to be in my orbit, where else would I be?
Ross, if you're quite finished playing
"Who's got the bigger hard drive,"
I have an update for you both.
Excuse us.
Pleasure.
Pascal is wired, transmitting, and en route.
Let's just hope he sticks to the plan.
Oh, he will.
Victoria's exactly the leverage we needed.
I thought I was going to have to navigate this event alone.
What kept you?
I'm sorry for making you wait.
Is there something you need to tell me, Pascal?
Let's begin our life away from here now.
We can leave the party... take the plane to Corsica.
I can't.
We must.
I love you.
You do believe me, don't you?
I do.
I'll see you later.
Looks like happily ever after.
I know we've had our differences, but...
it seems like you're actually getting what you deserve.
Congratulations, Victoria.
Welcome, all.
This is a big moment for my company,
and also for my family.
Tonight, I am very happy
to announce that my daughter, Margaux,
will be my successor at Lemarchal media.
I also give the stage to her.
So, please welcome Margaux Lemarchal.
I'm so proud of you.
Merci, papa.
So, tonight,
my partner, Daniel Grayson, and I invite you to witness
the next revolution in personalized technology.
So, what if an app knew you better than you know yourself?
What if it could...
anticipate your desires and help others fulfill them?
Well, today, "What if" becomes "What you can't live without."
And to tell you more,
I'd like to introduce you to the architect of Myclone.
Ladies and gentlemen, the remarkable Javier Salgado.
Myclone is a hyper-personalized search engine
and social-media hub gathering data
to re-create the person themselves.
On the outside...
...and inside.
Hey, Charlotte.
Hi, Javier.
So, my girlfriend really wanted to be here tonight.
But since she couldn't,
you all get to see the power of Myclone.
Hey, babe. What do you want to do for your next birthday?
That's easy -- to get high and party.
High on life, I'm sure.
Uh, let's -- let's take it to one of our guests.
You. Would you tell everybody your name?
Kristiana Rubins.
Well, Myclone has already done voice, name, facial recognition
and is now pulling from every database in the world
to create...you.
We'd like to send you anywhere on our dime.
Mm-hmm. So, let's plan your dream trip.
Where do you want to go?
Sarajevo -- There's a flight leaving JFK in 12 hours
with a connection in Munich.
Sounds exotic.
Should we book it?
Is this some kind of sick joke?
My family was massacred there when I was 9.
I barely escaped with my life.
Um, our most sincere apologies.
Like any prototype, there are glitches to iron out.
Well, I tried to tell Javier Myclone wasn't ready.
So I manipulated the data dumps...
...for every single person here to show him.
Nice.
He'll have another one.
Yes, sir.
Same for me.
Will this round come with another obscure threat?
I no longer want to play games
with people who should be my allies.
Oh, I'm glad to see you've come to your senses.
I was just on my way out.
I'll make it worth your while.
Well, then, walk with me.
What the hell was that?
It was probably Nolan.
He's the only person that's smart enough to pull this off.
I thought we were paying you to be best.
You are. I'll fix it.
No, you won't.
No. You see, we own the program now.
We don't need you to make it a success.
You're out.
Okay. No, no, no.
Your performance out there was the only reason
we won't take a dive in the market tomorrow.
Still, I mean -- - Hey, hey, hey. No.
What happened out there had Nolan Ross all over it.
But if he's stupid enough
to sabotage his former protege's launch,
it gives us instant credibility when we let the world know.
Okay?
Wait. Pascal's headed in the wrong direction.
You think he's gonna sell us out?
I'm not gonna let him.
Aiden, Pascal's deviating from the plan.
Watch to see where they exit the building.
I'm ready.
Ems, they're headed up, not down.
Stay here. Let me know what floor they get off on.
They must be headed for the penthouse.
No, no, no. No, wait. Ems, they're going to the roof.
And you may have some unwanted company soon.
I have to fly back to the Hamptons.
Care to join?
Let's talk here.
What's -- what's so pressing?
I'm haunted by things we did in our past.
And what were those, pray tell?
Trevor Mathis. David Clarke.
No, those are your ghosts, Pascal, not mine.
I want to move on. Don't you understand?
I want what I've always wanted --
To win at any cost.
Or do you need me to be more specific?
Yes, I do.
Well, let's try this.
Sometimes, to thrive,
you need to do the unexpected.
Pascal, watch out!
No! My God!
Better call 911.
Why aren't you arresting him?
For what, my dear?
As I was telling the detective, Pascal wanted to talk,
and I offered him a ride to the Hamptons.
He stepped back, and...
I mean, I tried to warn him, but it was too late.
You can't believe a word he says.
The pilot corroborates his story.
It's a damn tragedy.
No, no!
Right. Okay.
Well, thank you. Bye.
That was the local police calling back about the cabin.
There's nothing illegal about writing to you,
but they should be able to make sure
that it doesn't turn into something else.
That's probably why my mom was saving the letters --
to have evidence if it did.
You okay?
Yeah.
It would have been nice to meet my dad.
I've heard so many things about him from so many people.
I wonder what he was actually like, if I'm anything like him.
Well, he was a good guy.
So, yeah, Charlie, you are.
Need a ride home?
I think I'm gonna take a walk, be alone for awhile.
Thanks, Jack, for putting my mind at ease.
I don't understand.
I mean, I'm supposed to believe my father tripped and fell?
What was he doing with Conrad, anyway?
Margaux, we'll get answers.
I promise. But right now, you just...
I mean, years of wanting a relationship with him,
and it was there.
We were having it.
No one could have seen this coming.
Can people stop with their condolences?!
Just give me a moment!
They're not condolences.
You're the new C.E.O.
Don't -- d-don't worry. Don't even think about it.
I'll handle everything for now, okay?
He's gone.
Oh, he's really gone.
He just pushed him, Aiden.
I've never seen anything like it.
Conrad certainly chose a brazen moment to get his hands dirty.
Do you think he was onto us?
He was onto something.
He's clearly willing to go to great lengths to protect himself.
We need to take him down.
Do you have a plan?
I think so.
To succeed, a revolution requires absolute dedication
against overwhelming odds.
We'll see if I can go through with it.
At a moment's notice, the tide can turn.
And every casualty stokes the fire
to win at any cost.
"Victoria, our future is limitless.
"To eternity together.
I love you."
Mom?
Anything I can do for you?
Yes.
You can tell me how your father
came to learn of Pascal's intentions.
Did you tell him?
Of course I didn't tell him.
He's probably got a contact at Homeland Security
who tipped him off!
He's taken my future away from me again,
and I'm going to see him burn in hell for it.
We don't actually know what happened up there.
And from where I stand,
neither guy was looking to do right by you.
Don't you dare.
Pascal loved me.
There's something else.
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up. This is, like...
Daniel, please.
I just want to be alone.
There's one thing I can't wrap my head around.
If the Feds were running Pascal,
where are they now?
The number you have dialed is no longer in service.
If you think you've reached this number in error,
please hang up and try again.
The number you have dialed is no longer in service.
Because the only guarantee in a revolution
is that the innoce are the first to fall.
