hot &apos; n &apos; brown &apos;s coffee really wakes me up
to the fact that its coffee sucks .
i miss having a coffee shop .
now where am i going to get
my cappuccinos and sarah mclachlan cds ?
it wasn &apos;t that great . if i had this space ,
i would have served fresh fruit and sandwiches ,
and i would &apos;ve got rid of that
take @-@ a @-@ penny , leave @-@ a @-@ penny nonsense .
if the good lord wanted you to have a penny , you &apos;d have one .
pierce ...
why do you look like a wealthy murderer ?
i look like an entrepreneur .
now that my dad &apos;s gone , i &apos;m expanding hawthorne industries
by investing in new products .
like ... these .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s an automatic security camera
that can tell your friends from intruders .
how does it work ?
your guests have arrived .
threat level four .
your guests have arrived .
it &apos;s not calibrated .
wireless racism . the future of the past is now .
why don &apos;t you put your money into a good idea , like shirley ?
oh , i made that offer the first day i met her .
she almost broke my nose .
i mean , shirley &apos;s good with food ,
you have capital , and greendale has real estate .
what are you talking about , britta ?
i &apos;m talking about the whole reason you came here--
to start a business .
what do you think , shirley ?
should i have my people call your people ?
i mean , not your people .
i could think about it .
is shirley bennett in the house ?
the year was 1991 .
andre , what are you doing here ?
spring fling dance .
see , that &apos;s where i first laid eyes on shirley edwards .
a vision in hyper color and hammer pants .
baby girl , i have loved you ever since there was a soviet union
and only one damon wayans .
baby , i know i &apos;ve made mistakes ,
but i &apos;m so happy we &apos;ve made it through .
but there &apos;s one thing ,
something important , that we keep putting off .
will you , shirley bennett ,
marry me , andre bennett , again ?
yes , yes , again !
shall i notify authorities ?
第三季第十一集
it &apos;s cool that andre and shirley are getting married again .
there &apos;s a whole generation
of viewers that didn &apos;t get to see the original .
let &apos;s hope it &apos;s more of a bale than a kilmer situation .
second weddings are okay , i guess .
if i had to rank &apos; em , uh ...
it would go fourth , seventh , second ,
fifth , first , third , sixth .
no , wait--first then fifth .
got it--
fourth , seventh , second , first , fifth , third , sixth .
when &apos;s our culture gonna outgrow this wedding thing ?
you &apos;re anti @-@ wedding , now ?
no , she &apos;s just pro @-@ anti .
no to everything you both said .
weddings are like little girls &apos; tea parties ,
except the women are the stuffed animals ,
the men are making them talk ,
and they &apos;re not drinking tea ,
they &apos;re drinking antiquated gender roles .
somebody tell britta what an analogy is .
i know what it is .
it &apos;s like a thought with another thought &apos;s hat on .
look , i can &apos;t get behind this marriage thing , either .
it was invented back when &quot; till death &quot; meant &quot; till your first cold . &quot;
i mean , life &apos;s too long to spend it with someone else .
it &apos;s a sucker &apos;s game .
it &apos;s a mutual cop out .
i mean , just nut up and die alone .
hello .
oh , my god , we &apos;re so happy for you !
you are glowing .
i know , isn &apos;t it exciting ?
the rehearsal is in two days ,
and the wedding is the day after that ,
on our anniversary .
and i &apos;m sure you all can make it ,
because you &apos;re already here .
you &apos;re having your wedding in the study room ?
our church has certain policies regarding things like second weddings ,
and tight jeans and ...
calico cats .
um , jeff , i was wondering if you would do us the honor
of giving a toast at our wedding ?
good idea !
jeff has a lot of thoughts about marriage .
i would be honored .
shirley , do you need any help with your wedding ?
this probably sounds silly ,
but every time i see a wedding idea i like ,
i put it in a little scrapbook .
oh , that &apos;s nice .
we can help too .
we just saw the inspector spacetime wedding episode ,
so we know what pitfalls to avoid .
be sure to get a dna reading of your prospective mate .
inspector spacetime ended up marrying himself as a baby .
i think i got this .
everyone just come and ...
relax and behave normally .
that &apos;s the noise people make when they &apos;re offended
in all the movies that annie rents .
we &apos;ll try not to embarrass you
at your community college library wedding .
thank you .
oh , shirley ,
i managed to set up a meeting with the dean ,
so we can pitch him our sandwich shop idea .
i &apos;ve already registered a website--
it &apos;s , uh , h @-@ t @-@ t @-@ p , colon , forward slash , forward slash ,
w @-@ w @-@ w , period , members , period ,
webplicity custom sites-- all one word--period ,
c @-@ o--
oh , i don &apos;t know , pierce .
i &apos;m way too busy for that now with the wedding and everything .
bye @-@ bye , everybody .
i have to practice my walk .
great .
another business venture down the toilet .
no problem , i &apos;ve still got plan &quot; c. &quot;
ladies and gentlemen , the trouser bench .
for the man on the go who makes frequent stops .
will somebody please call all the ambulances ?
i can &apos;t believe shirley .
we should show up at this wedding
and be the most normal people in the world .
yeah , i could go as normal man
and you could be my trusty sidekick ordinario .
no . that &apos;s already weird .
we &apos;d be playing into her hand .
we should just show up wearing boring gray suits
with gray ties and gray shirts .
we could dye our hair gray .
and then we could lay down on the sidewalk and be invisible .
you know , maybe shirley &apos;s got a point .
i have an idea .
what if we purged all the weirdness from our systems ?
you mean--
a full 24 @-@ hour weird @-@ down
in the dreamatorium .
just you , me , and our imaginations--no restraints .
by the wedding , our temptation to act weird will be gone .
i &apos;m feeling more normal already .
crab walk home ?
yeah .
shirley , my ninth @-@ grade english teacher used to say ,
&quot; there will always be a reason not to follow your dreams . &quot;
at the time , he meant i was under the age of consent .
but his words still apply .
are you sure your wedding is the reason you &apos;re bailing
on this business with pierce ?
uh , in the words of my ninth @-@ grade english teacher ,
&quot; you are dippin &apos; and dappin &apos; and don &apos;t know what &apos;s happenin &apos; . &quot;
fine , we both went to public school .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t want to see you slide
into your old comfort zone .
you don &apos;t know that .
i am gonna start a business-- soon !
i can &apos;t help it if i have floral arrangements to pick . and a dj to hire--
shirley , if that really is your excuse ,
i will plan your wedding for you !
thank you .
oh , my good god . thank you for that .
i was serious .
britta , you &apos;re not planning my wedding .
what if annie helps ?
oh , hey , guys .
did someone say &quot; annie , &quot; &quot; help , &quot; &quot; wedding , &quot;
and something about maybe hydrangeas ?
shirley , you can lie to yourself ,
but you can &apos;t lie to me .
do not use your second wedding as an excuse to limit yourself .
pierce , come here .
shirley , do you take this man to be your business partner ?
mmm , i guess .
sure .
i had to shelve the trouser bench anyway .
there are still some parts of the prototype that need to be extracted .
maybe you &apos;re misunderstanding ?
i mean , from my butt .
excuse me .
meet shirley .
she &apos;s modern , she &apos;s urban ,
she &apos;s fun , and she &apos;s hungry .
you probably notice she &apos;s black , but not a stereotype--
suburban black .
is she suburban or urban ?
she &apos;s half @-@ urban .
let &apos;s say-- writer &apos;s secret , bad pitch--
her father &apos;s a record producer , her mother &apos;s a shirelle .
we &apos;re supposed to be preparing a business pitch .
what about revenue projections ? what are the margins gonna be ?
shirley , shirley , shirley ........
sweet , innocent shirley .
what was the question ?
look ,
this was britta &apos;s stupid idea .
i &apos;d rather be with my man , planning my wedding ,
and you &apos;d clearly rather be with halle berry in 1999 .
pleasure not doing business with you .
shirley , hawthorne wipes fired me .
they were just waiting for my dad to be out of the picture .
i &apos;m not an entrepreneur .
i &apos;m just a kid with a bunch of money , i ...
please , please , help me be somebody .
let me invest in you .
first thing we need to figure out is our overhead .
do you have a pen ?
yeah .
these pockets .
do you know someone that can buy a pen ?
yes !
well , have you thought about the color story for your wedding ?
he means the theme of the wedding .
right , dale ?
same theme as every wedding--
conformity , blind participation , and patriarchal--
what about pink ?
we don &apos;t call it pink .
we don &apos;t call anything by its name .
that &apos;s , like , day @-@ one floral school stuff .
this is citrine . this is opalescent .
this is sea glass , cameo , and cerulean .
come on , how difficult is this ?
you do one of these , one of these ,
one of these , this one ,
this one and , like , stick a ribbon on it . happy ?
britta , that &apos;s a really beautiful arrangement .
color me lavender .
&quot; lavender &quot; means &quot; impressed . &quot;
yeah , well , great-- flowers look good in a pot .
there are people dying in uganda .
got it .
don &apos;t eat my skin !
i am shaving everything !
well , that should do it .
yeah .
my god , isn &apos;t tonight shirley &apos;s wedding rehearsal ?
look at how we &apos;re dressed .
yes , this simply won &apos;t do .
let &apos;s change into something appropriate for the occasion and be on our way .
i agree .
troy and abed being normal .
annie !
i need your help .
you &apos;re , like , sentimental and stuff .
i &apos;m really having trouble coming up with a toast .
i find that hard to believe , jeff .
you once convinced troy
that turtlenecks were made of turtles &apos; necks .
it &apos;s true , my superpower is that
i can assume any position that suits my purpose .
in that example--
keeping turtlenecks as an option for myself , down the road .
but i do have a kryptonite .
it &apos;s so obvious to me that marriage is dumb ,
i can &apos;t even pretend to get behind it .
you know what i think would make the perfect toast ?
you , as shirley &apos;s friend and a good guy ,
just saying what &apos;s really in your heart .
there &apos;s something real in there .
maybe that &apos;s what scares you .
i could use a drink .
shirley &apos;s sandwiches can offer students more food for less money ,
and provide the campus with a higher percentage of the profits .
pierce , put up the next slide .
that &apos;s me !
where &apos;d i get all that money i &apos;m holding ?
i &apos;m gonna tell you the three reasons
that shirley &apos;s sandwiches and your cafeteria
are going to be successful .
well , then i &apos;m writing this down , hmm ?
wait .
here &apos;s a pen .
thank you .
holy crap !
britta , you &apos;re really good at this .
i know .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
this may shock you , annie ,
but i come from a long line of wives and mothers .
many do .
but i ran away from it my whole life .
i refused to give santa a christmas list ,
because i didn &apos;t want to depend on any man for anything .
and now , look at me !
i &apos;m betty crocker . i &apos;m martha stewart .
i &apos;m one of the steppenwolf wives .
ohh , god .
i &apos;m gonna make some man very happy someday .
easy .
slow down .
what &apos;s with you guys ?
we de @-@ whimsified ourselves .
yep . we &apos;re normal now .
oh . good ?
hey , anybody seen shirley ?
what ? shirley &apos;s late to the rehearsal for her wedding ?
oh , my .
hey , man .
you don &apos;t have to be sarcastic .
i &apos;m not being sarcastic .
we &apos;re heavily invested in your situation .
nothing &apos;s more important to us
than your second wedding &apos;s rehearsal going smoothly .
walk away , man .
hey ! did you think of a toast ?
well , yeah .
uh , i had a drink ,
and i looked in my heart ,
and here &apos;s what i got so far--
&quot; webster &apos;s dictionary defines-- &quot;
stop !
&quot; webster &apos;s dictionary defines &quot; ?
that &apos;s the jim belushi of speech openings--
it accomplishes nothing ,
but everyone keeps using it and nobody understands why .
yeah , well , it &apos;s all i got .
that took me eight hours and six macallan neatses .
look , i &apos;m sorry , i just don &apos;t believe in marriage .
i do . it &apos;s inevitable .
and then i &apos;d put a counter across here and the ovens there .
okay , okay .
and how fiscal will the quarterly earnings be ?
well , initially , the fiscal--
wait , that question makes no sense .
i know .
i just want to sound as good at business as you are .
i probably shouldn &apos;t say this ,
but i cannot believe you learned all this at greendale .
you &apos;re very professional .
i am , aren &apos;t i ?
i brought sodas , so we can toast to our futures .
look at me now , dad .
dad ? oh , my god ,
i &apos;m supposed to be looking like a bride
for my wedding rehearsal to the dad of my children .
i &apos;m coming , baby .
that was ...
and odd dot to connect .
give me another .
what &apos;s with you ?
this is who i am .
andre , sorry i &apos;m late .
i have wonderful news .
where were you ?
uh , getting wonderful news .
the dean loved our pitch and--
your pitch ?
woman , i &apos;ve been waiting for you for two hours .
oh , no . has it been that long ?
i &apos;m so sorry .
don &apos;t you dare use your sexy voice on me .
it &apos;s just a rehearsal .
lord knows we &apos;ve done it before .
that &apos;s not the point .
shirley , i thought this wedding was supposed to be
the start of us getting back to normal .
back to normal ?
yes .
i need to not be mr. mom anymore .
okay , i got to get back to my stereo business .
you know my store &apos;s been struggling .
i &apos;m sorry , andre ,
but &quot; normal &quot; went out the door the day you did .
well , if we can &apos;t get back to the way things were ,
why the hell are we getting remarried ?
these shrimp are to die for .
walk the plank .
i think you &apos;ve mistaken us for pirates .
we are community college students .
abed , i just had an odd thought .
what if once you go from being weird to normal ,
you can never go back to being weird again ?
that is an odd thought .
well , let &apos;s hope it &apos;s the last .
cheers to that , my everyday friend .
hello , everyone .
shirley asked me to say something nice at her wedding .
this is the rehearsal .
shut up , leonard !
those teenage girls you play ping @-@ pong with are doing it ironically .
i searched my heart ...
for something nice to say at a wedding .
and i found nothing , so i had a drink .
and then i looked real hard .
and you know what i found ?
my daddy said he would stay with my mommy forever ,
and he left !
marriage is a lie ! nobody commits to this !
nobody stays with anybody forever ,
so why do we keep lying ?
i &apos;m gonna stay with somebody forever .
it &apos;s in my stupid dna .
i was born to be a wife
and that &apos;s all i &apos;m ever gonna be !
you expect anyone here to believe that ?
i don &apos;t care if anybody believes it , jackass !
it &apos;s a fact !
prove it , ding dong !
there are a lot of layers to this .
it &apos;s almost too conceptual to follow , but ...
i love it .
so that &apos;s what this was all about , andre ?
just about wanting me back in the kitchen ?
i thought you loved being a wife and a mother .
of course , but can &apos;t you see
that &apos;s not all i &apos;m about anymore .
hi , sorry , don &apos;t want to interrupt .
but you are cordially invited to prevent a disaster .
i promise to put your dreams before mine .
i promise to bottle up my repulsion
at the sight of your hair in the drain .
i promise to earn no more than 70 % of
what you would make at the same job .
what about babies ?
what about &apos; em ?
how many ?
pick a number , dick !
like , it &apos;s up to me !
what in god &apos;s name are you two doing ?
getting married .
what does it look like we &apos;re doing ?
you two are damn fools . oh , sorry .
i &apos;ll allow it .
i am a fool .
i was a fool to think i wasn &apos;t destined for a life of this .
i mean , look around .
can you even imagine what kind of wedding i could throw
if i actually gave a crap ?
no offense .
knock it off .
being good at weddings doesn &apos;t make you good at marriage .
exactly .
people can make all sorts of promises ,
but they never stick it out .
it &apos;s not something you just stick out , man , all right ?
it &apos;s a risk that you take together .
and you don &apos;t just promise it once .
you got to promise it every day .
yes , but the person you &apos;re making promises to
is going to change . you have to accept that .
i do . but do you promise to be patient
when that person &apos;s stereo business takes a little while
to get off the ground .
i do , but ...
do you accept that ten years is more than a little while
and that ipods aren &apos;t going away ,
and maybe it &apos;s time to let somebody else take the lead ?
i do .
you do ?
yes , baby , i swear i do .
then i promise i will do whatever it takes
to make this work forever .
well , in that case , let &apos;s rehearse this bad boy .
actually , you pretty much just married each other .
if you let me pronounce you man and wife ,
you can kiss the bride
and you can save like , um , 70 bucks .
what do you say , baby ?
done and done . husband and wife .
now how about it ?
let &apos;s party !
lame .
abed.abed ! abed !
we &apos;re weird . we need to be weird .
you want to see something weird ? check out this dance .
uh , what did you call this ? the &quot; lindbergh lean &quot; ?
what &apos;ll they think of next ?
inspector spacetime ...
ohh , thank the cosmic engineer i found you .
troy , this is hardly the time .
or is it hardly the space ?
okay , i see what you did there .
but now i have to get back to my lindbergh lean
with , uh--i &apos;m sorry , i didn &apos;t catch your name .
inspector ... what sort of creature
would do a dance called the lindbergh lean ?
blorgons ?
blorgons .
my name &apos;s danielle .
constable reggie , it appears the blorgons have developed
the ability to take human form .
weirdos .
your photonic bowler hat .
blorgon patrol .
shirley , i have some good news and bad news .
the good news is the board loved your sandwich shop idea .
the bad news is that they made a few calls
and sold the space to subway , the sandwich place .
what ? pierce and i put a lot of work into that idea .
how could you do this , dean ?
i &apos;m sorry !
the board went over my head on this one .
and i don &apos;t remember being invited to your wedding ,
so i guess we &apos;re even on the hurting @-@ each @-@ other front .
i &apos;m a blast at weddings .
there go all my dreams .
this is just a setback .
you don &apos;t have to give up just because of subway .
guess i better go break the news to pierce .
he &apos;s not gonna like this .
remember that temper tantrum he threw
when adam sandler &quot; stole &quot; his idea for jack and jill ?
you &apos;re underestimating him .
i think pierce is a lot more mature than we all give him credit for .
look at me now , dad ! how &apos;s it taste ?
how many sandwich places did you have ?
none !
